PREFACE TO THE AMERICAN EDITION. 



THE present work on cookery appeared in England under the 
title of " The Official Hand-Book of the National Training School for 
Cookery," and it contains the lessons on the preparation of food 
which were practised in that institution. It has been reprinted 
in this country with some slight revision, for the use of American 
families, because of its superior merits as a cook-book to be con- 
sulted in the ordinary way, and also because it is the plainest, sim- 
plest, and most perfect guide to self-education in the kitchen that 
has yet appeared. In this respect it represents a very marked 
advance in an important domestic art hitherto much neglected. 

A glance at its contents will show the ground it covers, and how 
fully it meets the general wants. The dishes for which it provides 
have been selected with an unusual degree of care and judgment. 
They have been chosen to meet the needs of well-to-do families, and 
also those of more moderate means, who must observe a strict econ- 
omy. Provision is made for an ample and varied diet, and for meals 
of a simple and frugal character. Receipts are given for an excellent 
variety of soups, for cooking many kinds of fish in different ways, for 
the preparation of meats, poultry, game, and vegetables, and for a 
choice selection of entries, souffle's, puddings, jellies, and creams. 
Besides the courses of a well-ordered dinner, there are directions 
for making rolls, biscuits, bread, and numerous dishes for breakfast 
and tea, together with a most valuable set of directions how to pre- 
pare food for the sick. The aim has been to meet the wants of the 
great mass of people who are not rich enough to abandon their 
kitchen to the management of professional cooks, and who must keep 
a careful eye to expense. But while the costly refinements of artis-

tic and decorative cookery are avoided, there has been a constant ref- 
erence to the simple requirements of good taste in the preparation 
of food for the table. 

But the especial merit of this volume, and the character by which 
it stands alone among cook-books, is the superior method it offers 
of teaching the art of practical cookery. It is at this vital point 
that all our current cook-books break down ; they make no provi- 
sion for getting a knowledge of this subject in any systematic way. 
So much in them is vague, so much taken for granted, and so much 
is loose, careless, and misleading in their receipts, that they are 
good for nothing to teach beginners, good for nothing as guides to 
successful practice, and only of use to those who already know 
enough to supply their deficiencies and protect themselves against 
their errors. In fact, the hand-book required to teach cookery 
effectually cannot be made by any single person in the usual man- 
ner, but it must be itself a product of such teaching. 

The present volume originated in this way, and embodies a 
tried and successful method of making good practical cooks. The 
lessons given in the following pages came from a training kitchen 
for pupils of all grades, and the directions of its receipts are so mi- 
nute, explicit, distinct, and complete, that they may be followed 
with ease by every person of common-sense who has the slightest 
desire to learn. They are the results of long and careful practice in 
teaching beginners how to cook, and have grown out of exercises 
often repeated with a view of making them as perfect as possible. 
It is commonly regarded as a good thing in a cook-book that its 
compiler has tested some of its receipts and points out the troubles 
and failures likely to occur in early trials. But the completeness 
of the instructions in this work was attained through the stupidities, 
blunders, mistakes, questionings, and difficulties of hundreds of learn- 
ers of all capacities, doing the work over and over again under the 
critical direction of intelligent, practical teachers, who were bent 
upon finding out the best method of doing each thing, and the best 
method of teaching others how to do it. Not a single item neces- 
sary to perfect the required process is omitted. The steps are sep- 
arated, and given in numerical order, so as to enforce attention to 
one thing at a time, and the right thing at the right time, while the 
precautions against mistakes are so careful that even the dullest can 
hardly go wrong. Each receipt in the volume is not only the formula

for a dish, but it is also a lesson in a practical process, so that in the 
preparation of every article of food something is gained toward 
greater proficiency in the art of cooking well. 

A few words in regard to the origin of the school in which it was 
produced will still further illustrate the character of this work. A 
vigorous movement has been made in England to elevate this branch 
of domestic economy by establishing schools for training pupils in 
the art of cookery. These schools have grown immediately out of 
the need of greater general economy among the working classes, as 
it was seen that the high prices of provisions were seriously aggra- 
vated by not knowing how to make the most of them in their kitch- 
en preparation. The attention of the managers of the South Ken- 
sington Museum of Arts in "West London was several years ago 
drawn to the subject ; and feeling that something required to be done, 
they established public lectures on the preparation of food with plat- 
form demonstrations of various culinary operations. But it was 
quickly found that mere exposition and illustration, though not 
without use, were wholly inadequate to the object in view ; because 
a cooking school, .to be thorough, must provide for practice. Lectur- 
ing, and explaining to pupils, and barely showing them how things 
are done, is sure to fail because cookery, like music, can only be 
learned by actually doing it. As well undertake to teach the piano 
by talking and exhibiting its capabilities as to teach a person how to 
make a dish properly by only listening and looking on. Provision 
had therefore to be made for forming classes to do themselves what 
they at first only saw others do. 

But this task was by no means an easy one. There were no pre- 
existing plans to follow ; qualified teachers and suitable text-books 
were wanting ; it was an expensive form of education ; the public 
thought it a doubtful innovation; and educational authorities dis- 
couraged it. But the parties interested decided that the time had 
come for a systematic and persistent effort. They felt their way 
cautiously, and in 1874 organized classes for graded courses of prac- 
tice. The object was to give women the best possible instruction in 
practical cookery, and for this purpose the school was open to all. 
But to make its work most largely useful, it was constituted as a 
Normal School for training teachers to go out and establish other 
cooking schools in different parts of the country. This has been 
since done with the most encouraging success, so that there are 



vi PREFACE. TO THE AMERICAN EDITION. 

, already a large number of cooking schools in England connected with 
the National or Common School system. 

As no cook-book to be found was worth anything to aid the 
practical instruction proposed, the teachers had to take this matter 
in hand at the outset. They began by drawing up a careful set of 
directions to be followed by the learners in doing their work. For 
each lesson in all the grades each pupil was furnished with a printed 
sheet of these directions, stating the ingredients of each dish to be 
prepared, the quantities and separate cost of these ingredients, what 
was to be done first, what next, and so on through the whole series 
of operations, nothing being assumed as known, and all the minute 
steps being indicated in the order that was found best. These guides 
were necessarily imperfect at first, and were subject to constant re- 
vision and extension as experience suggested corrections; in fact, 
they embodied the progress of the school in the successful attainment 
of its object. At each new printing the improvements that had been 
made were incorporated, and only after years of trial were these 
guides to practice at length combined and issued in a book-form. 
The lessons or receipts of this volume were all slowly elaborated in 
this painstaking manner, and the mode of working proved perfectly 
successful with the pupils. It was easy and pleasant, yet careful and 
thorough, and secured a rapid and gratifying proficiency. 1 

In saying that the South Kensington Cooking School has been 
successful, I speak from direct knowledge of it. I was a pupil there 
for several weeks, and carefully observed its operations. The classes 
showed the most extraordinary mental and social diversity. There 
were cultivated ladies, the daughters of country gentlemen, old house- 
keepers, servants, cooks, and colored girls from South Africa, togeth- 
er with a large proportion of intelligent young women who were 
preparing to become teachers. They worked together with a har- 
mony and good feeling that, I confess, somewhat surprised me, but 



1 The honor of contributing chiefly toward the establishment of this school and super- 
intending its development is due to Sir Henry Cole, the able director and master mind of 
the Bouth Kensington Museum. By his firm purpose and excellent judgment a novel 
experiment, surrounded by many difficulties, became a recognized success and a great 
national benefit. The "Lessons" were gradually brought into shape by the teachers, 
under the supervision of the accomplished daughter of Sir Henry Cole, whose initials 
(R. O. C.) were appended to them as revised for use in the school, and are also sub- 
scribed to the English Preface of this work.

they were all closely occupied and thoroughly interested ina TfoiSttJ^jg *> 
object. There were teachers to provide materials, to plan the daily *i 
work, to direct operations, and to be consulted when necessary; but 
the admirable method adopted left each learner to go through her 
task with but a small amount of assistance. Indeed, the complete- 
ness of the directions in hand seemed to assure the success of every 
pupil from the start. There was, of course, a difference in dexterity, 
and in facility of work previously acquired ; but raw beginners went 
on so well that they were astonished at what they found themselves 
able to do. 

American ladies when looking over these lessons are apt to smile 
at their extreme simplicity and triviality, but it must be remembered 
that the difference between good and bad cookery is very much a 
matter of attention to trifles. Slight mistakes, small omissions, 
little things done at the wrong time, spoil dishes. The excellence 
of these lessons consists in their faithfulness in regard to minutiae, 
and the habits they enforce of attention to trifling particulars. They 
make no claim to literary merit. The receipts are homely, direct, and 
meant only to be easily and distinctly understood. They are full of 
repetitions, because processes are constantly repeated, and it was 
necessary that the directions in each receipt should be full and 
complete. They are not enticing reading, because they were made 
to work by. The book, in fact, belongs in the kitchen where cook- 
ery is done ; and it is now republished because its success there has 
been demonstrated. Many hundred persons totally ignorant of the 
subject have become efficient and capable cooks by pursuing the 
mode of practice here adopted by going through these lessons 
and the same results can be obtained by pursuing the same method 
anywhere. American housekeepers who have any real interest in 
home improvement, and are willing to take a little pains to instruct 
their daughters or their servants in the art of cooking well, will 
find the volume an adequate and invaluable help toward the attain- 
ment of this object. It will prove a useful text-book in the cooking 
schools and young ladies' cooking clubs that are springing up in this 
country, and classes could be advantageously formed, by its help, 
for kitchen practice in every female seminary. 

In revising these lessons but very slight changes have been made, 
and those only of form. The prices of articles, an important feat- 
ure in the original work, and essential in the cooking school, have 



PKEFACE TO THE AMERICAN EDITION. 

been omitted, as they do not apply in this country ; and American 
prices have not been substituted because they vary so much in differ- 
ent localities. As the lessons were furnished on separate sheets for 
daily use in the school, they all took the form of the following ex- 
ample, and have been modified in the manner shown by referring 
to the same lesson on page 180 of the present volume :

Now we will show you how to make Mayonnaise Sauce. 

1. We take two eggs and put the yolks in one basin and the whiles (which 
will not be wanted) into another basin. 

2. We take a wooden spoon and just stir the yolks enough to break them. 

3. We add to them a saltspoonful of salt and half a saltspoonful of pepper 
and a tablespoonful of 1 French vinegar. 

4. We take a bottle of salad oil, and, putting our thumb half over the 
top, pour in, drop by drop, the oil, stirring well with a whisk the whole time ; 
a gill of oil will be sufficient. 

ST. B. We might add a teaspoonful of ready-made mustard or tarragon vinegar 
if liked, stirring it in smoothly. 

5. The saitce is now ready for use. 

Now it is finished. 



It has been suggested that the volume ought to be Americanized 
by omitting some of the English receipts that are but little used in 
this country, and substituting others for special American dishes. 



PREFACE TO THE AMERICAN EDITION. i x 

But this suggestion involves a total misconception of the character of 
the work, which is valuable solely on account of the qualities it de- 
rives from the experience of the Training School. As American 
dishes are not used in England, there were of course no " lessons " 
in their preparation. Common receipts would be out of place in the 
following pages, and receipts for American dishes could not be prop- 
erly introduced until they had been assimilated to the plan and pecul- 
iarities of the work. There are many hundred good English receipts 
that will be sought in vain in the volume; and those who refer to it 
to find the last new things in American cookery will of course he 
disappointed. It is not a receipt-book, but a book to show how to 
use and improve receipts ; or, as stated in the English preface, it is 
not a dictionary of reference, but rather a grammar of processes. Its 
merit is that it offers an improved mode of kitchen practice ; and, as 
the principles and conditions of good cookery are everywhere the 
same, all that is characteristic of the volume is just as applicable and 
valuable in this country as in England. 

As the subject of cookery is in close relations with that of diet, I 
have aimed to increase the usefulness of the present work by appending 
a valuable essay upon " Diet in Health and Disease," the latest that 
has appeared, and by an eminent living authority on dietetical ques- 
tions. Dr. Chambers is the author of various able works on the uses 
and effects of food, and in this article, which he recently contributed 
to the new edition of the " Encyclopaedia Britannica," he has summed 
up in an admirable manner the leading facts and principles of modern 
dietetical science. Hints derived from this essay will often be found 
of much service in directing housekeepers as to what it is best to 
cook, and in the composition of meals in various circumstances, 
with reference to occupation, enjoyment, and health.

PREFACE TO THE ENGLISH EDITION. 



I. THIS work has been written to explain in an easy way the first 
principles of good Cookery, and in the form of lessons is especially 
addressed to those who wish to carry them into practice. It has 
been the aim of the writer to leave no detail, however small, vaguely 
stated. It is taken for granted that the learner has no knowledge on 
the subject. The loose expressions, such as "a pinch," "a little," 
found in all cookery books, are therefore avoided, and precise quanti- 
ties are given. 

II. The work is not to be regarded as an exhaustive cookery book 
with numerous recipes. It aims to be rather a grammar than a dic- 
tionary. 

III. The lessons give a sufficient number of examples of cookery 
illustrating many degrees of cost : thus the rich may have a dish of 
curried rabbit for 3s. 8d., and the poor may have a dish of curried 
tripe for lOfd. 

IV. The work has been used and tested in the National Training 
School for Cookery since 18T5, and the instructors now employed in 
local schools throughout the country have been taught and practised 
by means of these lessons. 

Y. It has been found that it is most convenient to practise the 
lesson with the instructions in sight close at hand. An edition of 
each lesson has been printed on separate sheets of thick paper, for 
the use of students and teachers, which may be obtained at the Na- 
tional Training School for Cookery, or at any of the local schools. 

VI. The writer requests that the notice of any errors and omis- 
sions which are inevitable in a work of this kind may be communi- 
cated to R. O. C., at the National Training School for Cookery, Ex- 
hibition Road, London, S. W.

1. Dump the grate, and, with the poker, carefully re- 
move the clinkers that adhere to the fire-brick. 

2. Shovel into a scuttle the ashes, clinkers, and cinders 
or partially-burned coal. 

N. B. These should be sifted. Throw away the ashes and clinkers, but 
save the cinders, to use in kindling fires. 

3. Take a brush or wing, and sweep down all the soot 
from the flues and oven. 

N. B. This should be done every day, when bituminous coal is burned ; 
but if anthracite coal is used, the flues will not need cleaning oftener 
than once in two weeks. 1 Wood-stoves should be cleaned as often as 
once a week. 

1 Directions for keeping ranges and stoves in order are usually furnished 
by the dealer ; and as they vary with the construction, they may be appealed 
to for more specific instructions. 



2 LESSONS IN COOKERY. 

4. Mix some stove-polish in an earthen dish, with 
enough water to make it into a smooth liquid. 

5. Dip the blacking-brush in the mixture, and cover 
with it the whole of the range, working from the top 
downward. 

6. When the blacking is dry, rub it all over with a dry 
brush. 

7. Then take another brush and polish the range all 
over, so as to make it quite bright. 

8. Now sweep the soot and dust from the stove and the 
hearth. 

9. Steel handles and bolts may be polished by rubbing 
with emery-paper, but brass handles and bolts should be 
polished with both brick-dust and a leather. . 

10. To clean the slate or limestone hearth in front of the 
range, get a flannel and a pail of hot water; put in it 
some soda, and wash the hearth all over. 

11. Then wring the flannel out in hot water and smooth 
the hearth over, rubbing lightly all in one direction. 

12. Black-lead and polish the inside of the fender in the 
same way as you did the range, and brighten the rim of it 
with emery-paper. 

TO KINDLE A FIKE. 

1. Place a few sifted cinders at the bottom of the 
grate. 

2. Then put in some crumpled paper and arrange sticks 
over it, laying them across each other. For kindling an- 
thracite coal, hard wood should be added. Charcoal is 
sometimes used in place of wood, and is better, when it 
can be afforded. 

3. Place a few cinders above the wood, and light the 
paper at the bottom. 



CLEANING KITCHEN UTENSILS. 3 

4. When the wood is well on fire, put on a small quan- 
tity of coal, and wait till it is thoroughly heated and be- 
ginning to burn before more is added. 



LESSON SECOND. 
TO CLEAN A GAS-STOVE. 

1. Lift out the rest at the top. 

2. Wash the top of the stove and the rest with a flan- 
nel dipped in hot water and soda, so as to remove all grease 
and dirt ; then wring out the flannel, and partially dry the 
top of the stove. 

3. Now cover with stove-blacking, and polish in the 
same way as the kitchen range. 

N. B. Be careful not to stop up the gas-holes with the stove-polish. 

4. Sweep away the soot and dust, and put the rest back 
over the stove. 

LESSON THIRD 
TO CLEAN AN IRON SAUCEPAN. 

1. Wash the saucepan well in hot water and soda. 

N. B. All the black should be removed from the outside and bottom. 

2. Soap the palm of one hand, or a brush, and rub the 
inside of the saucepan. 

N. B. In washing any greasy utensil, it is best, if possible, to use the 
hand instead of a flannel, as the latter retains the grease, and so 
keeps putting the grease on again, instead of rubbing it off. 

3. Mix some sand and powdered soda together, and 
then dip the soaped hand or brush into it, and rub the in- 
side of the saucepan until it is quite clean and bright. 



LESSONS IN COOKERY. 

4. JSTow rinse it in water and dry it with a cloth. 

5. Clean the lid in the same way. 

N. B. A white enameled stewpan is cleansed in the same way. Great 
care should be taken to remove all the stains off the white enamel 
inside. 

N. B. Salt might be mixed with the sand, and used to remove the 
stains from the enamel. 



LESSON FOURTH. 
TO CLEAN A COPPER STEWPAN. 

1. Mix some sand and salt together on a plate half the 
quantity of salt to that of sand. 

2. Wash the stewpan well in hot water and soda. 

3. Soap the hand, or a brush, dip it in the salt and sand, 
and rub the inside of the pan until all stains are removed 
and it has become clean and bright. 

4. Rinse it out well in the water, dry the inside quickly, 
and then turn over the pan and clean the copper outside. 

5. Rub it in the same way with a soaped hand, or a 
brush dipped in sand and salt. 

N". B. If there are many stains on it, an old half lemon, or vinegar, 

might be used to remove them. 
N. B. Only the copper part should be cleaned with lemon or vinegar. 

6. Now rinse it again thoroughly, and dry it quickly 
with a cloth. 



CHAPTER II. 
ROASTING, BOILING, BAKING, FRYING. 



LESSON PIEST. 
BOASTING. 

To Roast Meat at an open range : 

1. Take your joint say a leg of mutton. 

2. See that it is quite clean, and, if necessary, scrape it 
with a knife, and wipe it over with a clean cloth. 

N. B. As a rule, meat should not be washed in water, as it takes 
some of the goodness out. If meat has been kept some time, and 
is not quite fresh, then you might wash it with a little vinegar and 
water, but it must be well wiped afterward. 

3. With a sharp knife cut off the knuckle-bone from 
the leg of mutton. 

N. B. Put aside the knuckle-bone. It can be used with beef for 
beef-tea, or be put in the stock-pot ; or the trimmings and one pint 
of water will make gravy for your joint when done, allowing it to 
boil while the joint is roasting. 

4. Trim off the piece of flank^ and remove the thick 
piece of skin from the part where the leg joins the loin. 



6 LESSONS IN COOKERY. 

(These trimmings must be put aside, as they can be used 
for other purposes.) 

5. Now weigh the leg of mutton, so as to find out how 
long it will take to roast it, as a quarter of an hour is 
allowed for each pound-weight, and one quarter of an hour 
besides. 

N. B. When you have a joint without bone, such as rolled ribs of beef 
or topside of beef, allow twenty minutes to each pound, as it is all 
solid meat. 

6. Take the leg of mutton, which weighs say seven 
pounds, and will therefore require two hours to roast. 

7. Put the tin oven * in front of the fire. 

8. See that the dripping-pan is in the oven with the 
dripping-ladle. 

9. Take the hook of the oven, or of the roasting-jack, 
if you have one, and pass it through the knuckle-end of 
the leg. 

10. Wind up the jack with the key before you put the 
joint on, so as to make it twist the meat round. 

11. Put the joint close to the fire for the first five 
minutes. 

12. After that time, draw it a little back, or it will cook 
too quickly, and become burnt and driedv 

N. B. Meat that is frozen must be placed some way from the fire at 
first, and then drawn gradually toward it, as it must thaw slowly, or 
it may become tough. 

1 In this country, tin ovens placed before the fire take the place of the 
English screen and roasting-jack. These ovens are made in various ways, 
but they all have a door at the back for basting, a hook in the centre from 
which the meat is suspended, and a dripping-pan in the bottom. A French 
roasting-jack may take the place of the simple hook, and with this you may 
proceed with the roasting according to the directions given above. There 
are stoves and ranges so made that tin ovens for roasting can be securely 
fastened to the front, and taken away when not in use. 



ROASTING AND BOILING. 7 

13. Baste the joint every five minutes with the drip- 
pings that run from it into the pan, using the dripping- 
ladle. 

14. Let it roast for two hours, as its weight is seven 
pounds. 

15. Just before you dish up the joint, you must sprinkle 
about a saltspoonful of salt over, and then baste it well. 

16. Warm a large dish. 

17. Take the hook of the jack and place the joint on 
the hot dish, and draw out the hook. 

18. Pour about a gill of hot stock into the dish. (This 
makes the gravy, and when the joint is cut, the juices 
from the meat will add to it.) 

19. Cut a piece of demy-paper like a fringe, and put it 
round the end of the knuckle-bone. 

N. B. The dripping in the pan should be poured into a basin, and 
when it is cold, there will be under the crust of dripping a good 
gravy. When the dripping is required for use, it must be carefully 
removed from the top of the gravy and clarified (see Lesson on 
" Frying "). Nearly all joints can be roasted in this way. Attention 
should be paid to the rules given above for joints of meat without 
bone. 



LESSON SECOND. 
BOILING. 

To Boil Meat: 

1. Give attention to the fire, and build it up gradu- 
ally with small pieces of coal, so as to make it burn clear 
and bright. 

2. You must not have a smoky fire for boiling, or the 
meat will get smoked. Start with a good fire, and keep 
it up by adding occasionally small coal, and so prevent 
smoke as much as possible. 

N. B. You do not require such a clear, bright fire as for roasting. 
2 



8 LESSONS IN COOKERY. 

3. Take a saucepan sufficiently large to hold the joint 
to be cooked. 

4. Fill the saucepan almost full of cold water, and put 
it on the fire to warm. 

N. B. Salt should always be added to the water in the saucepan to 
make the water taste, unless the meat to be cooked is already 
salted, in which case it should be omitted. 

5. Now take the joint, say, for example, a piece of the 
silver-side of beef, salted. 

6. See that it is quite clean, and, if necessary, scrape 
it with a knife, and wipe it over with a clean cloth. 

N. B. Meat should not, as a rule, be washed in water, as it takes some 
of the goodness out. Meat that has been kept some time, and is 
not quite fresh, might be washed with vinegar and water, but it 
must be well wiped afterward. 

N. B. Salt meat must not be washed with vinegar and water, but only 
with salt and water. 

7. Now weigh the piece of salt beef, so as to find out 
how long it will take to boil, as ten minutes .are allowed 
for each pound of 'meat. 

N. B. This rule refers to the boiling of all meat except pork, which 
requires fifteen minutes to each pound of meat. 

A. In boiling fresh meat to be eaten, the joint should be first 
plunged into boiling water, in order that the albumen on the outside 
of the joint may become hardened, and so prevent the escape of the 
juices of the meat. 

B. The temperature of the water should then be lowered gradually 
(by adding a small quantity of cold water and drawing the sauce- 
pan to the side of the fire), and the meat allowed to simmer gently, 
or it will become tough. 

C. In boiling meat for the purpose of making soup, the meat should 
be put into cold water, in order to extract all the goodness from it. 

D. The water should be brought gradually to boiling point, then 
moved to the side of the fire, and left to simmer gently for some 
length of time. 



BOILING. 9 

N. B. Salt meat must be put into loarm ivatcr, so as to extract a little 
of the salt before the pores of the skin are closed up. If the meat 
were" put into boiling water, the pores of the skin would be closed, 
and the meat would be hardened by the salt not being allowed to 
escape. 

8. When the water in the saucepan is warm, take the 
"beef, which weighs say eight pounds (it will therefore 
take about one hour and twenty minutes), and put it in 
the saucepan. There should be only just enough water to 
cover the joint. 

9. Let the water just boil up, and then move the 
saucepan to the side of the fire, and let it simmer gently 
for the remainder of the time. 

10. As soon as the water comes to the boil, you must 
take a large spoon and skim it carefully. 

N. B. The scum should be skimmed off directly it rises, or it will boil 
down again in the meat and spoil it. Scum is the impurity which 
rises from the meat. 

N. B. Be very careful not to let the meat boil, or it will be hardened 
and tough. 

11. When the meat is sufficiently cooked, take it care- 
fully out of the saucepan, and put it on a hot dish for 
serving. Pour about a gill of the liquor (in which it was 
boiled) round the joint. (This makes the gravy, and 
when the joint is cut, the juices from the meat will add 
to it.) 

N. B. The liquor from boiled meat can always be used for different 
purposes, and should therefore never be thrown away, but poured 
into a clean basin and put aside to cool. The fat should be carefully 
removed from the top of the liquor while it is cold, before being 
used. Salt liquor is often used for making pea-soup.

LESSON THIRD. 
BAKING MEAT, BKEAD, PASTRY, ETC. 

To Bake Meat : 

1. You must have a good fire, and keep it up, adding 
by degrees small pieces of coal, as the oven is required to 
be very hot. 

N. B. If it is a close range with which you are dealing, you should 
pull out the damper placed over the oven, in order to draw all the 
heat of the fire toward the oven. The ventilator x of the oven 
should be closed. 

N. B. In kitchen stoves there is usually either a handle at the top 
of the oven, to be pulled out for opening the ventilator, or a slide- 
ventilator at the bottom. 

2. Test the heat of the oven by the thermometer, 
which is fixed in the door of the oven. The heat should 
rise to 240 Fahr. 

3. See that the joint is clean, as directed in the Les- 
son on " Roasting," Note 2. Weigh it, to find out how 
long it will take to bake, as ten minutes are allowed foi 
each pound of weight. 

N. B. When you have a joint without bone, you must allow about fif- 
teen minutes to each pound of weight, as it is solid meat. 

4. Take the hot-water tin on which the stand for the 
meat is placed, lift up the upper tin or tray, and fill the 

1 As a rule, American ranges and stoves are not supplied with a separate 
arrangement for ventilating the ovens. The heat is usually controlled by 
opening and closing the damper in front of the fire. Ability to manage a 
range or stove in this respect comes only with experience. But in all our 
generally-approved ranges and stoves a competent cook can obtain well- 
baked meat, such as is described in this lesson, by making the oven very hot 
at first, and after a little, partially or wholly closing the damper, to lessen 
combustion. 



BAKING MEAT. 11 

under tin half full of warm water ; then fit on the upper 
tin. 

N. B. In one corner of the upper tin is a small hole for the escape of 
steam. The water must only just reach this hole, and not come 
into it. 

N. B. The water is placed in the tin to prevent the tin and the meat 
from getting burnt, and so causing a disagreeable smell. 

5. Place the stand on the hot-water tin, to raise the 
joint and prevent it from standing in its own dripping, 
which would sodden and spoil the meat. 

6. ISTow take the joint, which weighs say seven pounds 
(it will, therefore, take one hour and ten minutes to lake), 
and put it on the stand. Dredge flour over it. 

7. Put the tin, with the meat, in the oven. The oven 
should be kept very hot for the first five minutes, in order 
to form a brown crust on the outside of the joint, to keep 
in the juices of the meat ; after that time the ventilator 
of the oven should be opened, so as to allow the steam to 
escape, or the meat would get sodden ed. 

N. B. Meat that is frozen must be gradually warmed to thaw it, be- 
fore shutting it up in the hot oven, or it will be tough. 

8. Baste the joint every fifteen minutes with the 
drippings that run from the meat into the pan, using the 
dripping-ladle. 

N. B. Joints that are not very fat must be even more frequently 
basted, or they will burn. If there is not enough dripping from 
the meat, a little extra dripping should be put in the pan. 

N. B. Joints that have no fat should be covered with a piece of 
whity-brown paper which has been spread with butter or dripping ; 
it will prevent the meat catching too quickly. 

9. Turn the joint over occasionally, as the upper side 
will brown quicker than the under. 



12 LESSONS IN COOKERY. 

N. B. Potatoes, washed and peeled, or a small suet or dripping and 
flour pudding (see " Puddings," Lesson 28), or a Yorkshire pudding 
(see " Puddings," Lesson 29), might be baked under the meat ; but 
they should be put in only half an -hour before the meat is finished. 

10. Just before you dish up the joint, sprinkle a salt- 
spoonful of salt over it, and then baste it well. 

11. Serve the joint on a hot dish (as described in the Les- 
son on " Koasting," Note 18), and act with regard to the 
dripping according to N. B. after Note 19. 

N. B. Pastry or bread, etc., should not be baked in the oven at the 
same time as the meat, for the steam would prevent their baking 
properly. For baking small patties or tartlets made of puff-paste, 
the heat of the oven should rise to 300 Fahr. For meat-pies, tarts, 
etc., the heat should rise to 280, and be reduced, after a quarter 
of an hour, to 220. 



LESSON FOURTH. 
FETING, AND THE CLARIFYING OF BUTTEE, FAT, AND DEIPPING. 

The principles of Frying : 

1. You must have a clear, bright fire. 

N. B. Be very careful it is not smoky. 

2. Be careful that the utensil used is very clean ; for if 
there is anything sticking at the bottom of the pan, it will 
quickly catch or burn, and so spoil the contents. 

3. Clarify all fat (not lard ), dripping ', and butter be- 
fore using them, to remove the impurities from the former, 
and the buttermilk and other watery substance from the 
latter. 

N.B. Fat need not be clarified more than once. After using it, 
always pour it off carefully in a basin, and, when it is cold, remove 
the sediment from the bottom of the cake vifat. Sutler must be 
clarified each time it is used, to remove all watery substances. 



FRYING AND CLARIFYING. 13 

4. You must have the fat very hot ; good frying de- 
pends on the fat being properly heated. 

5. You should test the heat of the fat by a frimome- 
ter, if possible. The heat should rise to 345 Fahr. for 
ordinary frying, and 400 for whitebait. 

N. B. If there is no frimometer, the heat of the fat may be tested by 
the look as fat gets quite still and begins to smoke when it is 
very hot or by throwing in a small piece of crumb of bread ; and 
if it fries directly a light brown, the fat is ready for use. 

6. Use a deep pan, with plenty of fat, so that anything 
put in may be entirely covered. 

7. You can fry bacon in its own fat ; it only requires 
watching and turning till it is done (see Lesson on " Liver 
and Bacon," from Note 1 to Note 5). 

8. You may fry chops or steaks, or slices of meat, in 
an ounce of either clarified dripping or lutter. 

9. Melt the fat first, but it does not require to be 
heated. 

10. Be watchful, when the meat is frying, not to allow 
it to burn ; you should turn it over occasionally. 

N. B. If there is a gridiron, it is much better to broil chops and 
steaks, as it prevents their being greasy (see Lesson on a " Broiled 
Steak "). For frying Fish, see " Fish," Lessons Nos. 3, 6, 7, and 
1 3. For frying Meat, Rissoles, Potatoes, etc., see " Cooked Meat," 
Lessons Nos. 2 and 6 ; "Australian Meat," Lesson No. 8 ; " Entrees," 
Lessons Nos. 4 and 1 1 ; and " Vegetables," Lessons Nos. 3 and 4. 

To render down or clarify fat : 

1. Take any scraps of cooked or uncooked fat, and cut 
them up in small pieces. 

2. Put the pieces in an old but clean saucepan, and 
pour in just enough cold water to cover them. 

3. Put the saucepan on the fire, and keep it boiling ; 



14 LESSONS IN COOKERY. 

it will take about an hour. The lid should be off the 
saucepan. 

4. Stir the fat occasionally, to prevent it from burning, 
or sticking to the bottom of the saucepan. 

5. When the water has evaporated, and the pieces of 
fat are cooked, pour the melted fat through an old sieve 
into a basin, and, when cold, it can be used for all frying 
purposes, instead of lard. 

To clarify dripping : 

1. Put the dripping in the saucepan, and put it on the 
fire to boil. 

2. When it boils, pour it into a basin, in which there 
should be half a pint of cold water. 

3. When the dripping is cold, take a knife and cut 
round the edge, so as to take out the cake oj dripping. 

4 Scrape off all the sediment that will be found on the 
bottom of the cake, and wipe it dry with a cloth. 

To clarify butter : 

1. Put the quantity of butter required for present use 
in a small saucepan, and put it on the fire and let it boil. 

2. When the butter has boiled, take a spoon and re- 
move the white scum from the top. 

3. Then pour the clear butter carefully into the pan for 
use, as below the butter will be a little more watery sub- 
stance. 



CHAPTER III. 
THE RE-COOKING OF MEAT. 



LESSON FIRST. 
HASHED MEAT. 1 

Ingredients. One pound of scraps of cold meat. Two small onions. One- 
half a turnip. One bunch of herbs. 2 About a tablespoonful of flour. 
One dessertspoonful of mushroom catsup. Sippets of bread. Salt and 
pepper. Half an ounce of butter. 

Time required, about two hours ; or, if the stock for the gravy is already 
made, then only half an hour. 

To Hash Cold Meat : 

1. Take any remains of cold meat, cut off all the meat 
from the bone, and cut it into thin slices. 

2. Chop the bone in pieces, and put them into a sauce- 
pan. 

3. Peel one onion, and cut it in quarters. 

1 The food called " Hash " in this -country is more like the English minced 
meat (see Lesson No. 7, on " Re-cooked Meat "). 

2 This means a small handful of parsley, a sprig of thyme or marjoram, 
one or both, and one bay-leaf. The parsley should be washed, the dried 
herbs placed in the midst of it, and the ends of the parsley should be folded 
around them, making a bunch about three inches long. Tie with a string, 
and trim away any leaves that might break off if left. This is known among 
cooks as a " bouquet garni," or " faggot." 



16 LESSONS IN COOKERY. 

4. Wash and scrape one carrot, and cut it in quarters. 

5. Peel half a turnip, and cut it in half. 

6. Wash a sprig of parsley, and dry it on a cloth. 

7. Take one 'bay-leaf, one sprig of marjoram and 
thyme, and the parsley, and tie them tightly together with 
a piece of string. 

8. Put the herbs and vegetables into the saucepan with 
the bones, and cover them with cold water. 

9. Put the saucepan on the fire, and, when it boils, add 
pepper and salt, according to taste. 

10. Now put the lid on, and move the saucepan to 
the side of the fire, to stew gently for one hour, or 
one hour and a half ; watch it, and skim it occasion- 
ally. 

11. Take a small onion, peel it, and cut it in slices. 

12. Put half an ounce of butter into a frying-pan. 

13. Put the pan on the fire, and, when the butter 
is melted, add the sliced onion, and let it fry a nice 
brown. 

14. Shake the pan occasionally, to prevent the slices of 
onion from sticking to the bottom of the pan and burning. 

15. When the onion is sufficiently browned, strain off 
the butter, and put the onion on to a plate. 

16. Wheti the bones have stewed long enough, strain off 
the liquor into a basin. 

17. Wash out the saucepan, and pour back the liquor. 

18. Put a tablespoonful of flour into a small basin. 

19. Add a tablespoonful of the liquor to the flour, and 
stir it into a smooth paste. 

20. Stir this paste gradually into the liquor in the sauce- 
pan. 

21. Add the browned onion and a dessertspoonful of 
mushroom catsup. 



THE RE-COOKING OF MEAT. 17 

22. Put the saucepan on the fire, and stir the sauce until 
it boils and thickens. 

23. Let it boil for two or three minutes, until the flour 
is cooked. 

N. B. Be careful to stir the sauce smoothly while it boils, or it will 
be lumpy. 

24. Then move the saucepan to the side of the fire, and, 
when it is off the boil, lay in the pieces of meat, to warm 
through. 

N". B. Do not let the sauce boil while the meat is in it, or the meat 
will get hard and tough. 

25. Cut a thin slice of "bread into square pieces. 

26. Cut these square pieces in half, cornerwise, making 
the pieces into triangles. 

27. Put one ounce of clarified dripping (see Lesson on 
" Frying") in a frying-pan, to melt. 

28. When the dripping is quite hot, put in the sippets 
of toead, and let them fry a light brown. 

29. Turn them, so that they will get browned on each 
side. 

30. Put a piece of kitchen-paper * on a plate, and, when 
the sippets are fried, turn them on to the paper to drain 
off the grease. 

N. B. If liked, the bread could be toasted before the fire, instead of 
fried ; in which case it should be cut into sippets after it is toasted. 

31. For serving, put the slices of meat on a hot dish in 
the centre, strain the sauce over them, and put the sippets 
of oread round the edge of the dish. 

1 Kitchen-paper is unsized white paper, such as is used for wall-paper. It 
is common in English kitchens, and very convenient for many purposes. 



18 LESSONS IN COOKERY. 

LESSON SECOND. 
MEAT FRITTERS. 

Ingredients. Slices of cold meat. Six ounces of flour. One tablespoon- 
ful of salad oil. Two eggs. Dripping for frying. 

Time required, about half an hour (and one hour for the baiter to rise). 

To make " Meat Fritters " i. e., meat fried in batter : 

1. Put six ounces of flour and half a salirspoonful of 
salt into a basin. 

2. Add a tablespoonful of salad oil y and mix the flour 
into a smooth paste. 

N. B. Be careful that the oil is sweet. One ounce of melted butter 
can be used instead. 

3. Now stir in smoothly, by degrees, half a pint of 
tepid water. Be careful that there are no lumps. 

4. Break two eggs ; put the whites on a plate. (The 
yolks should be put in a cup, as they will not be required 
for present use.) 

5. Sprinkle a quarter of a salt-spoonful of salt over the 
whites of the eggs, and whip them to a stiff froth with a 
knife. 

6. Stir the whipped whites of the eggs lightly into the 
latter. 

N. B. In winter, clean snow might be used in the batter, instead of 
the whites of eggs. 

N. B. This batter might be made without the whites of eggs, in 
which case'it should be mixed with half a pint of beer, instead of 
the water ; but the batter made with beer will not rise as much as 
when eggs are used. 

N. B. The beer will not taste after the batter is fried. 



THE RE-COOKING OF MEAT. 19 

7. Stand the batter aside for one hour to rise, or until 
required for frying but it should not stand longer than 
two hours. 

8. Put half a pound of clarified dripping (see Lesson 
on " Frying " ) into a saucepan, and put it on the fire to 
heat. 

9. Take some cold meat, and cut it up into thin slices. 

N. B. Cold boiled or roast pork, or boiled bacon, is very nice fried 
in batter. 

10. "When the batter has risen, and the fritters are re- 
quired for use, stir the batter lightly with a spoon, so as to 
be sure that there are no lumps settled at the bottom. 

11. When the dripping is quite hot and smoking, take 
the slices of meat, dip them in the latter so as to quite 
cover them, and then drop them into the hot fat. 

N. B. Do not put in too many slices at a time, as they should not 
touch each other. 

12. Turn them over, so that they will fry to a nice 
brown on both sides. 

13. Put a piece of kitchen-paper on a plate. 

14. As the fritters are fried, take them carefully out of 
the fat with a perforated spoon, and put them on the paper, 
to drain off the grease. 

N. B. Be careful to skim the fat from time to time, or the little loose 
pieces of batter will burn, and spoil the fat. 

N. B. Slices of apple or orange can be fried in this batter in the 
same way, only that the batter should be sweetened, and sugar 
sprinkled over the fritters when they are fried. 

N. B. Fish can be fried in batter the same way, only that the batter 
is usually made with beer, instead of white of egg. 

15. For serving, turn the fritters on to a hot dish.

suet, two of moist sugar, two of currants, two of plums, and two of 
chopped apples. A quarter of a pound of flour. A quarter of a tea- 
spoonful of baking-powder. One ounce of dripping. 

Time required, about three-quarters of an hour. 

To make "Goblet Pie": 

1. Take any scraps of cold meat (even the smallest 
scraps, that would not do for anything else), put them 
on a board, 1 and chop them up as finely as possible. 
(There should be about two tablespoonfuls of chopped 
meat.} 

2. Take about two ounces of suet, put it on a board, 
cut away the skin, and chop it up very finely. (There

a cloth, and pick them over. 

6. Put all" these ingredients into a basin with two table- 
spoonfuls of moist sugar, and mix them all well together 
with a spoon. 

1 When only small quantities of things are to be made fine, it is very con- 
venient to place them upon a board, and, taking a sharp knife, hold down 
the free end of the blade with the left hand, and chop by moving the handle 
rapidly up and down with the right hand. Some cooks chop in this way 
upon the table, but a board is preferable.

To make " Shepherd's Pie " : 

1. Take one and a half pound of potatoes, wash them, 
and boil them as described (see "Vegetables," Lesson 
Fo. 1). 

N. B. This quantity of potato will cover a quart pie-dish. 
N. B. Any remains of cold potatoes should be used, instead of boiling 
fresh ones. 

2. Put one ounce of butter and half a gill of milk into 
a saucepan, and put it on the fire to boil. 

3. Put the boiled potatoes into another saucepan, and 
mash them up with a fork or spoon. 

4. When the milk boils, pour it into the mashed pota- 
toes, and stir them into a smooth paste. 

5. Put the saucepan on the fire, and let the potatoes 
just boil. Be careful they do not burn. 

6. Take any scraps of cold meat, cut them in small 
pieces, and put them in a pie-dish in layers.

finely as possible on a board. 

9. Sprinkle each layer of meat with plenty of pepper 
and salt, and a little of the chopped onion. 

10. Fill the dish half full of cold water. 

N. B. If there is any cold gravy, it would, of course, be better than 

the water. 
N. B. The pie-dish should be quite full of meat, and rather heaped 

in the centre, so as to raise the crust of potato. 

11. Take the mashed potato and put it over the top of 
the meat, smoothing it over neatly with a knife. 

12. Take a fork, and mark all over the top of the potato. 

N. B. If liked, the mashed potato might be mixed with half its weight 
of flour into a dough, to make a more substantial crust ; it must 
then be rolled out with a rolling-pin, like pastry. 

13. Put the pie-dish into the oven, or into a tin oven 
in front of the fire, for half an hour, to brown the crust 
of potato and warm the meat through.

head* 



ON COOKING MEAT. 91 

32. Pour the broth carefully into a basin, without the 
bread or vegetables. 

N. B. Bread or vegetables should never be kept in broth, as they 
would turn it sour. 

33. Put the basin of broth away until required for use. 

N. B. All the fat should be removed from the broth before it is used. 
N. B. When the broth is required for use, a few toasted crusts of 

bread might be added, and a little chopped parsley. 
N. B. The fat from the broth should be melted down into dripping. 

If the Sheep 1 } s Head be preferred browned : 

1. Proceed as above (see from Note 1 to Note IT). 

2. Then move the saucepan to the side of the fire, and 
let it simmer gently for one hour. 

N. B. The lid should be on the saucepan. 

3. Take a piece of stale bread, and grate a tablespoon- 
ful of bread-crumbs with a grater. 

4. Mix with these crumbs a teaspoonful of parsley and 
a teaspoonful of mixed herbs, chopped fine. 

5. When the head has simmered for one hour, take it 
out of the saucepan. 

6. Cut the string round it, and lay it on a dish. 

7. Sprinkle the bread-crumbs and herbs over the head, 
and put a few tiny pieces of dripping on it. 

8. Put the dish in the oven, or in front of the fire, for 
ten or fifteen minutes. It will then be ready for serving. 

9. Take the brains and wash them well in cold water 
(removing all skin). 

10. Tic them up in a piece of muslin and put them in 
the saucepan of broth (in which the sheep's head was 
boiled), to boil for ten minutes. 

N. B. For serving, the tongue should be skinned, as above, and served 
separately with the brain-sauce (see above, from Note 21 to Note 27). 

11. Proceed with the broth the same as above, from 
Note 32.

LESSON FOURTEENTH. 
STEWED STEAK. 

Ingredients. One pound of rump steak. One carrot. One turnip. Two 
sticks of celery. One onion. One ounce of butter. One tablespoonful 
of flour. Pepper and salt. 

Time required, about one hour. 

To Stew a Steak (either beef or rump the latter is 
more tender) : 

1. Put one pound of rump steak, one and a half inch 
in thickness, on a board. 

2. Cut off all the skin and fat from the steak. 

3. Wash one carrot, one turnip, and a few celery-leaves, 
in cold water. 

4. Scrape the carrot clean with a sharp knife. 

5. Cut the turnip in half (as not all will be required), 
and peel off the outside skin. 

6. Peel the carrot and turnip into thin ribbons with a 
sharp knife, leaving just the centre of each vegetable. 

7. Peel one onion and put it on a board. 

8. Shred the onion and celery. 

9. Put one ounce of Gutter in a stewpan, and lay the 
steak in it to brown. 

10. Put the onion, celery, and the remains of the car- 
rot and turnip, after peeling, into the stewpan with the 
steak. 

11. Put the stewpan on the fire. 

12. Look occasionally at the steak, and when it is suffi- 
ciently browned on one side, turn it carefully over, to 
brown the other. 

13. When the steak is sufficiently browned on both 
sides, then put in the vegetables. 



ON COOKING MEAT. 93 

14. Take a basin and put in it a tablespoonful of flour, 
half a teaspoonful of salt, half a salt-spoonful of pepper, 
and mix them together with a wooden spoon, and one pint 
of water or stock. 

15. Stir them all well together into a smooth sauce. 

16. Pour this sauce into the stewpan with the steak and 
vegetables, and stir all together until it boils and thickens. 

17. Let it gently simmer one hour. 

18. Take the fat which you have cut off the steak, and 
cut it into small pieces. 

19. Put the pieces of fat on a tin dish. 

20. Put the fat in the oven to cook till brown. 

N. B. It is better for stewed steak to cook the fat separately, as it 
keeps the gravy of the steak free from grease. 

21. Take the thin peelings from the carrot and turnip, 
and put them on a board and shred them finely with a 
sharp knife. 

22. Put these shredded vegetables into a small saucepan, 
with about a gill of cold water. 

23. Put the saucepan on the fire, and let it boil until 
the vegetables are quite tender when tried with a fork. 

24. When the steak is sufficiently stewed, put it on a 
hot dish. 

25. Take a strainer and strain the gravy, in which the 
steak has-been stewed, over the steak. 

26. The stewed vegetables must be thrown away, as all 
the goodness is out of them. 

27. Take the tin dish out of the oven, and place the 
pieces of fat about on the steak. 

28. Take the boiled shredded vegetables and garnish the 
steak with them. 

N. B. Any other vegetables can be used for garnishing i. e., peas, 
French beans, asparagus, etc.

3. Beat it up as much as possible, as it will make the 
batter lighter. 

4. Take one pound of meat, put it on a board, and cut 
it in neat pieces. 

N. B. Buttock steak, beef skirt, or any pieces of mutton, might be used ; 
for instance, the short bones from the neck of mutton. Sausages or 
cold meat might very well be used. 

5. Take a pie-dish, or a tin, and grease it inside with 
clarified dripping. 

6. Season the pieces of meat with pepper and salt, and 
place them in the greased dish.

IESSON FIRST. 
TRUSSING A FOWL FOB BOASTING. 

Ingredients. One fowl. One ounce of butter. One large roll. One 
onion. Half a pint of milk. Five pepper-corns. Salt. One tablespoon- 
ful of cream. 

Time required, about three-quarters of an hour. 

To prepare a Fowl and Truss it for Roasting : 

1. Take a suitable fowl that has been already plucked, 
and put it on a board. 

2. Turn the fowl on its breast, and make an incision of 
an inch long down the neck, three inches below the head. 

3. Pass your thumb round this incision, and loosen the 
skin. 

4. Take a sharp knife and pufc it under the skim, and 
cut off the neck as low down as possible. 

5. Be careful, in cutting off the neck, to leave a piece 
of skin to fold over on to the back of the neck and cover 
the opening. 

6. Take out the crop, which lies in the front of the 
neck. 



96 LESSONS IN COOKERY, 

7. Then, with your finger, loosen the liver and the 
other parts at the breast-end. 

8. Now turn the fowl round, and make an incision at 
the vent, about one inch and a half wide. 

9. Put your hand through this incision into the body, 
and draw out all the interiors carefully, so as not to mess 
the fowl. 

10. Be very careful not to break the gall-bag, or the 
liver will be spoiled. 

N. B. Take the liver, heart, and gizzard, and put them in a basin of 
water, with about half a teaspoonf ul of salt ; the other interiors 
should be thrown away. 

N. B. Look through the fowl from one end to the other, and see that 
it is perfectly cleared out. 

11. Take a damp cloth and wipe out the inside of the 
fowl, to clean it thoroughly. 

N. B. If the fowl is not quite fresh, use a little vinegar and water on 
the cloth in cleaning it, and then take a clean cloth and wipe it 
quite dry. 

12. Take a sharp knife and cut off the claws from the 
legs of the fowl. 

13. Take a basin of boiling water, and hold the ends of 
the legs of the fowl in the water for a minute or two. 

14. Then take off the outside skin as far as to the first 
joint. 

15. Take a twist of paper, or a taper, and light it. 

16. Take the fowl up by its legs, and hold the lighted 
paper under it, to singe off the little hairs. 

17. Then hold the fowl up by its wings and singe the 
other end. 

N. B. Be careful, in singeing, not to blacken or mark the fowl in 
any way. 

18. Turn the fowl on its breast, and draw tightly the 
breast-skin over the incision on to the back of the neck. 



COOKING POULTRY. 97 

19. Cross the ends of the wings over the back of the 
neck. 

20. Now turn the fowl on its back, with the neck 
toward you. 

21. Take a tmssing-needle and thread it with fine twine. 

22. Hold the legs up and press the thighs well into the 
sides of the fowl, forcing the breast up, to give the fowl 
a good shape. 

23. Take the threaded trussing-needle and pass it 
through the bottom of one thigh, through the body, and 
out on the other side through the other thigh. 

N. B. If liked, a part of the gizzard and liver, when cleaned (see note 
at the end of " Trussing a Fowl for Boiling "), can be put into the 
wings of the fowl. 

24. Now turn the fowl on its breast, and take the 
threaded trussing-needle again and pass it through the 
middle of the pinion or wing, through the little bone 
called the sidesman or step-mother's wing, catching up 
the skin which folds over the incision, and out through 
the other little bone and wing. 

25. Pull this twine very tightly, and tie it as firmly as 
possible at the side of the fowl. 

26. Turn the fowl over on its back, keeping the neck 
still toward you. 

27. Put your finger in the incision (made for drawing 
ihefowl), and lift up the end of the breast-bone. 

28. Take the threaded trussing-needle and pass it through 
the skin over the bottom of the breast-bone, over the end 
of one leg, back through the body close to the back-bone, 
and tie it firmly over the other leg at the side. 

N. B. If there is no gravy ready for serving with the roast fowl, 
prepare it now (see note at the end). 



98 LESSONS IN COOKERY. 

29. Now put the tin oven, with the jack and dripping- 
pan, before the fire. 

80, Make up the fire in the same manner as described 
in "Boasting." 

N. B. You do not require such a large fire as for roasting meat. 

31. Take the trussed fowl, and pass the hook of the jack 
through the back of the fowl, and hang it up on the jack. 

N. B. If the fire is very fierce, you should take a piece of whity- 
brown paper, butter it, and tie it over the fowl, so as to prevent 
it from burning. 

32. Put one ounce of butter in the dripping-pan to melt. 

33. Use this melted butter to baste the fowl; as the 
fowl is not very fat, there will not be much dripping 
from it. 

34. The fowl will take from half an hour to three-quar- 
ters of an hour to roast, according to its size. 

35. Baste the fowl frequently. 

36. When the fowl is quite done, take it off the jack 
and put it on a hot dish. 

37. Take a knife and cut the twine, and draw it all out 
of the fowl, and take off the paper before serving. 

For making Bread-Sauce : 

1. Take a French penny-roll and cut it in half. 

2. Pull out all the inside crumb and put it on a plate. 

3. Pull this crumb apart into small pieces. 

N. B. If a French roll cannot be procured, bread-crumbs can be used 
instead about one ounce and a half. 

4. Take a small onion and peel it with an onion-knife. 

5. Take a small stewpan and put in it the peeled onion. 

6. Pour in half a pint of milk. 

7. Now put in the crumb of the roll. 

8. Add five pepper-corns ', and salt to taste. 



COOKING POULTRY. 99 

9. Stand the stewpan aside, with the lid on, for a 
quarter of an hour, to soak the crumb. 

10. After that time, put the stewpan on the fire, and 
stir the sauce smoothly with a wooden spoon, until it boils. 

11. Now add a tablespoonful of cream, and stir the 
sauce until it just boils again. 

12. Before serving the sauce, take out the onion, and 
then pour it into a sauce-tureen. 

N. B. The neck, gizzard, liver, and claws of the fowl, when properly 
prepared (see note at the end of " Trussing a Fowl for Boiling "), 
can be used for soup or gravy, to be served with the roast fowl. 
For making the gravy, put the giblets into a saucepan, with enough 
water to cover them (about half a pint) ; also add half an onion 
(peeled), six pepper-corns, and salt to taste. Put the saucepan on 
the fire, and, when it comes to the boil, move it to the side, to 
simmer while the fowl is roasting. 

N. B.For serving, strain the gravy into a basin, and color it, if 
necessary, by stirring in a quarter of a teaspoonf ul of " Liebig's 
Extract" or ten or twelve drops of caramel (see note at the end of 
" Australian Meat," Lesson No. 2, " Brown PurSe ") ; then pour it 
in a sauce-tureen, or round the fowl. 



LESSON SECOND. 
TRUSSING A FOWL FOB BOILING. 

Ingredients. One fowl. One and a quarter ounce of butter. Stock or 
water. One carrot. One small onion. A bouquet of herbs. Two eggs. 
One ounce of flour. One- half a pint of milk. A gill of cream. 

Time required, about one hour and a quarter. 

To prepare a Fowl and Truss it for Boiling: 

1. Take a fowl that has been already plucked and put 
it on a board. 

2. Prepare it and clean it in the same way as de- 
scribed in " Trussing a Fowl for Boasting," from Note 1 
to Note 12. 



100 LESSONS IN COOKERY. 

3. Take a sharp knife and cut off the claws and the 
ends of the legs of the fowl, to the first joint. 

4. Take a twist of paper, or taper, and light it. 

5. Take the fowl up by its legs, and hold the lighted 
paper under it, to singe off the little hairs. 

6. Then hold the fowl up by its wings and singe the 
other end. 

N. B. Be careful, in singeing, not to blacken or mark the fowl in 
any way. 

7. Turn the fowl on its back, with the tail toward you. 

8. Put your hands through the incision (made for 
drawing the fowl), and pass two fingers round the inside 
of the leg, so as to loosen the outside skin. 

9. Draw this outside skin right off the legs, and press 
the legs well into the sides of the fowl, forcing the breast 
up, so as to give the fowl a good shape. 

10. Pull this outside skin, and turn it neatly inside the 
fowl, over the joints of the legs. 

11. Turn the fowl on its breast, and draw tightly the 
breast-skin over the incision on to the back of the neck. 

12. Cross the ends of the wings over the back of the 
neck. 

13. Now turn the fowl on its back, with the neck 
toward you. 

14. Take a trussing-needle and thread it with fine twine. 

15. Take the threaded trussing-needle and pass it through 
the bottom of one thigh, through the body, and out on 
the other side through the other thigh. 

16. Now turn the fowl on its breast, and take the 
threaded trussing-needle again and pass it through the 
middle of the pinion or wing, through the little bone 
called the sidesman or step-mother's wing, catching up 



COOKING POULTRY. 101 

the skin which folds over the incision, and out through 
the other little bone and wing. 

17. Pull, this twine very tightly, and tie it as firmly as 
possible at the side of the fowl. 

18. Turn the fowl over on its back, keeping the neck 
still toward you. 

19. Put your finger in the incision (made for drawing 
tliefowl), and lift up the end of the breast-bone. 

20. Take the threaded trussing-needle and pass it 
through the skin over the bottom of the breast-bone, over 
one leg, back through the body close to the back-bone, 
and tie it firmly over the other leg at the side. 

21. Take a piece of kitchen-paper and butter it well. 

22. Take this piece of buttered paper and wrap it well 
round the fowl. 

23. Take a large saucepan half full of hot second white 
stock or water, and put it on the fire. 

N. B. The reason why second white stock should be used is, that the 
goodness which comes from the fowl after boiling adds to the good- 
ness of this stock, which can afterward be used for soup. 

N. B. If hot water is used, the goodness which comes from the fowl 
after boiling is only wasted, as it is not of sufficient strength to 
make the large quantity of water of any use. 

24. When the water is quite boiling, place the fowl in 
the saucepan, with its breast downward. 

25. Put into the saucepan one carrot which has been 
scraped, a small onion which has been peeled, and a 
bouquet of herbs, for flavoring. 

26. The fowl will take from three-quarters of an hour 
to one hour to boil, according to its size. 

To make the Egg-Sauce to be served with the Soiled 
Fowl: 

1. Take a small saucepan full of hot water, and put it 
on the fire to boil. 



102 LESSONS IN COOKERY. 

2. When the water is quite boiling, put in two eggs to 
boil for ten minutes 

3. Take a stewpan and put in it one ounce of Gutter 
and one ounce of flour. 

4. Mix them well together with a wooden spoon. 

5. Pour in half a pint of milk. 

6. Put the stewpan on the fire, and stir the mixture 
with a wooden spoon until it boils and thickens. 

7. Then remove the stewpan to the side of the fire 
until required for use. 

8. When the eggs are sufficiently boiled, take them 
carefully out of the saucepan with a spoon. 

9. Knock the eggs against the edge of a basin, to break 
off all the shell. 

10. Take a small basin of cold water. 

11. Cut the eggs in half and take out the yolks. 

12. Put the whites into cold water, to prevent their 
turning yellow. 

13. Take the whites of the eggs out of the water and 
cut them to the shape of small dice. 

14. Add the pieces of white of egg to the sauce in the 
stewpan. 

15. Now add one gill of cream to the sauce. 

16. Move the stewpan to the centre of the fire, and stir 
well till it boils again. 

N. B. Be careful, in stirring, not to break the pieces of egg. 

17. When the fowl is sufficiently boiled, take it out of 
the stewpan ; take off the buttered paper, and place the 
fowl on a hot dish. 

18i With a knife cut the twine, and draw it all out of 
the fowl. 

19. Take the stewpan off the fire, and pour the sauce 
over fhefowl. 



COOKING POULTRY. 103 

20. Take a wire sieve, with the hard-boiled yolks of the 
eggs, place it over the fowl, and rub the yolks through on 
to the breast. 

N. B. The neck, gizzard, liver, heart, and claws of the fowl namely, 
the giblets should be put aside, and, when properly prepared, 
can be used for soup (see " Soups," Lesson Sixth), or should be 
put in the stock-pot. 

N. B. To clean and prepare the giblets for use : 

A. Take the gizzard, cut it very carefully with a knife down the cen- 
tre, where there is a sort of seam (be sure only to cut the first or 
outer skin), and draw off the outer skin without breaking the in- 
side, which should be thrown away. 

B. Take the outer skin of the gizzard, the heart, and liver, wash them 
well in water, and dry them in a cloth. 

C. Take the neck, cut off the head, which is of no use, draw the skin 
off the neck, and wash the latter well in water, so as to remove 
the blood and any impurities. 

D. Put the claws and ends of legs in a basin of boiling water for 
some minutes ; then take a knife, cut off the nails, and draw off 
the outer skin, which can be pulled off like a glove. 



CHAPTER IX. 
STOCK AND SOUPS. 

LESSON PIRST. 
STOCK. 

Ingredients. Four pounds of shin of beef, or two pounds of knuckle of 
veal, and two pounds of beef. Four young carrots, or two old ones. One 
turnip. One onion. One leek. Half a head of celery. Salt. 

Time required, about five hours. It should be made the day before it is re- 
quired for use. 

To make Stock for Soup : 

1. Take four pounds of skin of ~beef and put it on a 
board. 

2. Cut off all the meat from the bone with a sharp 
knife. 

3. Cut off all the fat from the meat. (Put it aside for 
other purposes.) 

4. Take a chopper and break the bone in half. 

5. Take out all the marrow and put it aside for other 
uses. 

N. B. If the fat and marrow were to go into the stock, it would 
make it greasy. 1 

6. Take a stock-pot, or a large stewpan, and put the 
meat and hone into it. 

1 Which is no great matter, as appears from 21. 



STOCK AND SOUPS. 105 

7. Pour in five pints of cold water. 

N. B. One pint of water is allowed for each pound of meat, and one 
pint over. 1 

8. Put in half a teaspoonful of salt. This will assist 
the scum to rise. 

9. Put the stock-pot on the fire with the lid on, and 
let it come to the boil quickly. 

10. Take four young carrots, scrape them clean with a 
knife, and cut them in pieces. 

11. Take one turnip and one onion, peel them, and cut 
them in quarters. 

12. Take a leek and half a head of celery, and wash 
them well in cold water. 

13. Take a spoon and remove the scum from the stock 
as it rises. 

14; Now put in all the vegetables, and let it simmer 
gently for Jive hours. 

15. Watch and skim it occasionally, and add a little 
cold water, to make the scum rise. 

16. Take a clean cloth and put it over a good-sized basin. 

17. Put a hair-sieve on the top of the cloth over the 
basin. 

18. When the stock has been simmering for five hours, 
take the stock-pot off the fire. 

19. Pour the contents into the sieve which contains the 
meat, lone, and vegetables ; and the cloth very effectually 
strains the stock. 

N. B. The meat and bone can be used again, with the addition of 
fresh vegetables and water, and you thus make what is called 
second stock." 

i One pint of water extra is added to every two quarts, on account of 
evaporation. 

9 Second stock cannot be used for clear soup unless it is first clarified, as 
shown in Lesson Third. 



106 LESSONS IN COOKERY. 

20. Take the basin (into which the stock has been 
strained) and put it in a cool place till the next day, when 
it will be a stiff jelly. 

21. When this stock-jelly is required for use, take off 
the hardened fat from the top with a spoon. 

22. Take a clean cloth and dip it in hot water, and 
wipe over the top of the jelly, to remove every particle 
of fat. 

23. Now take a clean dry cloth, and wipe the top of 
the jelly dry. 

N. B. This is brown stock ; but for some soups and purges, as well 
as for many other purposes, white stock is required. This is made in 
the same way, only with veal instead of beef. It can also be made 
of veal and beef mixed, or rabbit and beef ; but veal alone is con- 
sidered best. 



LESSON SECOND. 
VEGETABLE STOCK. 

Ingredients. One cabbage. Three large or six small onions. Two carrots. 
One turnip. Two ounces of butter. Three cloves. Thirty pepper-corns. 
A bunch of herbs (thyme, marjoram, and a bay-leaf). Salt. 

Time required, about two hours and a quarter. 

To make Vegetable Stock : 

1. Take one cabbage, wash it well in cold water, and 
cut it in quarters. 

2. Take two carrots, wash them, scrape them clean, 
and cut them in quarters. 

3. Take one turnip, peel it, and cut it in quarters. 

4. Take three large or six small onions and wash them 
clean. (The skins are to be left on.) 

5. Put all these vegetables into a saucepan, with two 
oimces of Gutter. 



STOCK AND SOUPS. 107 

6. Add a lunch of herbs (namely, a sprig of thyme, 
marjoram, and a lay-leaf), tied tightly together, three 
doves, and thirty pepper-corns. 

7. Put the saucepan on the fire, and let the vegetables 
and herbs sweat in the butter for ten minutes. Stir them, 
to prevent burning. 

8. ISTow pour in three quarts of cold water, and add 
salt according to taste. 

9. When the water boils, move the saucepan to the 
side of the fire, and let it simmer gently for two hours. 
Watch it, and skim it occasionally. 

10. After that time, strain the stock into a basin, and it 
is ready for use. It is now reduced to two quarts and 
one-half a pint. 

N. B. This stock can be used for thick vegetable soups. 



LESSON THIRD. 
CLEAR SOUP. 

Ingredients. Two quarts of stock. Three-quarters of a pound of gravy- 
beef. Two carrots. Two turnips. One and one-half a leek. One cab- 
bage-lettuce. One tablespoonf ul of young peas. Salt. One lump of sugar. 

Time required (the stock should be made the day before), about one hour and a 
half. 

To make Clear Soup : 

1. Take two quarts of stock 1 (see Lesson First on 
" Stock "), and be careful to remove from it all fat. 

1 This lesson only applies to second stock, or stock that, for any reason, 
has become turbid. Stock carefully made by the directions in Lesson First on 
" Stock " is already clear, if a little care is taken to separate the sediment at 
the bottom of the jelly. It is only second stock, or stock made from odds 
and ends of meat and bones, cooked and uncooked, that requires to be clarified. 



108 LESSONS IN COOKERY.

will make cheese Ramaquins. 

19. Put the tin in a hot oven to bake from twenty min- 
utes to half an hour. Look at it once or twice to see that 
it does not burn ; but the door of the oven should not be 
opened too often while the souffle is inside, lest it should 
check the souffle from rising properly. 

N. B. To serve a baked souffle", it should be kept in the tin, the 
buttered paper taken off, and. a clean napkin folded round the 
tin. It can also be baked in a mould, which slips inside a plated- 
silver dish sold for the purpose. This 'is the more elegant way of 
serving a souffle" or fondu.

CHAPTER XXIII. 
CANNED MEATS. 



NOTE. In the English edition of this work, the present chapter appeared 
under the title of "Australian Meat," which consists of cooked and canned 
meats that are brought into England in large variety, and are coming into 
such general use there that it was found desirable to give them some atten- 
tion at the training-school. " Australian Meat," however, is not to be ob- 
tained in the American market ; but as we have its equivalent in the canned 
meats put up in this country, the title of the chapter has been changed, to 
prevent misapprehension and inconvenience. 

The directions in the following lessons are not so much for cooking canned 
meats which are indeed already cooked as for using them as ingredients of 
various complex dishes, such as soups, stews, curries, fricassees, and hashes, 
and for these purposes the American canned preparations answer just as well 
as the Australian. For such uses canned meats deserve more attention than 
they generally receive. 1 Everybody now understands the value of having 
fruits and vegetables such as peaches, cherries, pears, tomatoes, corn, beans, 
peas, and asparagus ready at hand, as they not only give an agreeable and 
healthy variety to diet, but are easily and quickly prepared, and thus save 
labor and trouble to the house-keeper. The advantages are the same with 
canned meats, especially in the country, where markets are not near by. 
And even in competition with butcher's meat, canned beef and mutton do not 
make a bad showing in point of economy ; for when beef and mutton are 
procured from the market, there is not only a loss by the removal of bone, 
fat, and gristle, but also a loss of weight in the operation of cooking, so that 
the meat upon the table should properly be estimated at nearly double the 
market-price. As the canned meats consist of the pure muscular fibres, with 

1 Tet their use is rapidly extending. "We were informed by Mr. Alexander Wiley, the 
intelligent superintendent of the department of " canned goods " in the establishment of 
H. K. & F. B. Thurber, of New York, that this trade has doubled in a comparatively short 
time, while the saving to the country through this preservation of perishable food -prod- 
ucts is probably not less than fifty million dollars annually. 



CANNED MEATS. 309 

their contained nutritive juices, these sources of loss are avoided ; and while 
the expense is no greater, the trouble of preparation is saved. 

In purchasing canned meats, much depends upon the character of the 
articles, and the buyer will consult his interest by purchasing only well-known 
brands. Among these are Thurber & Co., Wilson, Libby, Underwood, and 
Richardson & Bobbins. Almost everything in the way of meat is to be had 
thus preserved, but different establishments confine themselves more or less 
to special preparations. As an example of the variety of animal products 
that are furnished in this manner, the following are selected from Thurber's 
Price-List of June 6, 1878: Corned beef, beef tongue, mutton, ham, lamb's 
tongue, pig's feet, tripe, sausage, pork and beans, turkey, duck, chicken, 
clams, clam broth, lobster, oysters, green turtle, salmon, shrimps, codfish- 
balls, julienne, mock-turtle and ox-tail soups, condensed milk. Most of 
these articles are, moreover, prepared in a variety of forms. EDITOR.

edges together with your thumb. 

17. Take two ounces of vermicelli and rub it between 
your hands, crushing it up as fine as possible. 

18. Put this crushed vermicelli on a piece of paper. 

19. Put the rissoles into the plate of egg, and egg them 
well all over with the brush.

20. Then turn them into the crushed vermicelli, and 
cover them well with it, but not too thickly. 

N. B. Be careful to finger them as little as possible, so as not to rub off 
any of the egg or vermicelli, or the rissoles will burst while frying. 
N. B. Bread-crumbs might be used instead of vermicelli. 

21. Take a frying-basket and put in the rissoles/ you 
must be careful that they do not touch each other.

smoking, put in the frying-basket and let the rissoles fry a 
minute or two, until they become brown. 

23. Put a piece of kitchen-paper on a plate. 

24. As the rissoles are fried, turn them from the fry- 
ing-basket on to the piece of paper, to drain off the grease.

fully, and remove the fat from the part of the meat re- 
quired for immediate use. 

6. Take one and a half pound of the meat out of the 
tin. 

7. If all the meat is required for present use, turn it 
all out of the tin, and then rinse out the tin with half a 
pint of warm water, to make the gravy for the hash. 

N. B. If all the meat has not been taken out of the tin, take some of 
the jelly out of the tin, and melt it in half a pint of warm water, 
to make the gravy. 

8. Pour this gravy into the saucepan with the flour 
and butter, and stir well until it boils and thickens. 

9. Now move the saucepan to the side of the fire to 
keep warm. 

10. Take a penny's worth of mixed pickles and chop 
them up finely. 

11. Stir the chopped pickles, or a teaspoonful of vinegar, 
into the sauce. 

N. B. If the flavor of the pickles or the vinegar is disliked, they 
might be omitted. 

12. Take a sprig or two of parsley (wash it and dry it 
in a cloth) and a sprig of marjoram and t^yme, take away 
the stalks, and chop up the leaves finely on a board.

To make a Jfince served with Mashed Potatoes : 

1. Wash one and a half pound of potatoes in cold 
water, and scrub them clean with a scrubbing-brush. 

2. Peel them with a sharp knife ; cut out the eyes and 
any black specks.

THE PRINCIPLES OF DIET IN HEALTH AND DISEASE. 



THE application of science to the regulation of the continuous 
demands of the body for nutriment aims mainly at three ob- 
jects : Health, Pleasure, and Economy. They are rarely inconsistent 
with one another, hut yet require separate consideration, as, under 
varying circumstances, each may claim the most prominent place in 
our thoughts. 

INFLUENCE OF DIET UPON HEALTH. 

The influence of diet upon the health of a man begins at the ear- 
liest stage of his life, and, indeed, is then greater than at any other 
period. It is varied by the several phases of internal growth and of 
external relations, and in old age is still important in prolonging 
existence and rendering it agreeable and useful. 

Diet in Infancy. No food has as yet been found so suitable for 
the young of all animals as their mother's milk. And this has not 
been from want of seeking. Dr. Brouzet (" Sur 1'Education M6dici- 
nale des Enfants," i., p. 165) has such a bad opinion of human mothers, 
that he expresses a wish for the State to interfere and prevent them 
from suckling their children, lest they should communicate immoral- 
ity and disease ! A still more determined pessimist was the famous 
chemist, Van Helmont, who thought life had been reduced to its 
present shortness by our inborn propensities, and proposed to substi- 
tute bread boiled in beer and honey for milk, which latter he calls 
"brute's food." Baron Liebig has followed the lead with a "food 
for infants," in the prescription for which half-ounces and quarter- 
grains figure freely, and which has to be prepared on a slow fire, 
and after a few minutes boiled well. And after all, not nearly such 
a close imitation of human milk is made as by the addition to fresh 



330 DIET IN HEALTH AND DISEASE. 

cow's milk of half its bulk of soft water, in each pint of which has 
been mixed a heaped-up teaspoonful of powdered " sugar of milk " 
and a pinch of phosphate of lime. Indeed, in default of these cheap 
chemicals, the milk and water alone, when fresh and pure, are safer 
than an artificial compound which requires cooking. And experi- 
ence shows that the best mode of administering food to the young is 
also that which is most widely adopted throughout warm-blooded 
nature namely, in a fresh, tepid, liquid state, frequently, and in 
small quantities at a time. 

Empirical observation is fully supported in these deductions by 
physiological and chemical science. Milk contains of 

Water 88 per cent 

Oleaginous matter (cream or butter) 3 " 

Nitrogenous matter (cheese and albumen) ..... 4 " 

Hydrocarbon (sugar) ... . 4$ " 

Saline matter (phosphate of lime, chloride of sodium, iron, etc.) $ " 

These are at once the constituents and the proportions of the con- 
stituents of food suited to a weakly, rapidly-growing animal. The 
large quantity of water makes it pass easily through the soft, ab- 
sorbent walls of the digestive canal ; and the complete suspension, 
in an alkaline fluid, of the finely-divided fat and nitrogenous matter 
introduces more of them than could be effected were they in a solid 
form. The fat is the germ of new cellular growth, and the nitro- 
genous matter is by the new cells formed into flesh, which is doubling 
its bulk monthly. The phosphate of lime is required for the harden- 
ing bones, the chloride of sodium and the iron for the daily-increasing 
amount of blood in circulation. Milk may be said to be still alive as 
it leaves the breast fresh and warm, and quickly becomes living 
blood in the infant's veins. A very slight chemical change is requi- 
site. Its frequent administration is demanded by the rapid absorp- 
tion, and the absence of regular meals prevents the overloading of 
the delicate young stomach with more than it can hold at once. 

The wholesomest nutriment for the first six months is milk alone. 
A vigorous baby can, indeed, bear with impunity much rough usage, 
and often appears none the worse for a certain quantity of farina- 
ceous food ; but the majority do not get habituated to it without 
an exhibition of dislike, which indicates rebellion of the bowels. 

To give judicious diet its fair chance, the frame must be well 
protected from the cold ; and just in proportion as the normal tern- 



THE FOOD OF INFANCY. 331 

perature of the body is maintained, so does growth prosper, as is 
satisfactorily proved by experiments on the young of the lower 
animals. 

It is only when the teeth are on their way to the front, as shown 
by dribbling, that the parotid glands secrete an active saliva capable 
of digesting bread-stuffs. Till then, anything but milk must be given 
tentatively, and considered in the light of a means of education for 
its future mode of nutrition. Among the varieties of such means, 
the most generally applicable are broth and beef-tea, at first pure, 
and then thickened with tapioca and arrow-root. Chicken-soup, 
made with a little cream and sugar, serves as a change. Baked flour, 
biscuit-powder, tops and bottoms, should all have their turn. Change 
is necessary in the imperfect dietary which art supplies, and for 
change the stomach should be prepared by habit. 

The consequences of premature weaning are insidious. The 
external aspect of the child is that of health ; its muscles are strong, 
but the bones do not harden in proportion ; and if it tries to walk, 
its limbs give way, and it is said to be suffering from rachitis, or 
" rickets." 

These consequences follow in other animals as surely as in the 
human race ; and in them it was possible to make the experiment 
crucial. A gentleman named Gugrin set himself to find if he could 
produce rickets at will. He took a number of puppies in equally 
good condition, and, having let them suckle for a time, he suddenly 
weaned half of them and fed them on raw meat a fare which on 
first thought would seem the most suitable for carnivorous animals. 
Nevertheless, after a short time those which continued to take the 
mother's milk had grown strong and hearty, while those which had 
been treated with a more substantial dietary pined, and frequently 
threw up their victuals, then their limbs bent, and at the end of about 
four months they showed all the symptoms of confirmed rickets. From 
these experiments we must conclude that the rachitis depended 
mainly on the derangements of nutrition brought on by improper 
diet. A diet which is taken at the wrong season may fairly be 
called improper. For carnivora, it is flesh before the age of suckling 
has passed ; for herbivora (and an experiment bearing on the point 
has been made on pigs), it is vegetable feeding begun when they 
ought to be at the teat. 1

332 DIET IN HEALTH AND DISEASE. 

The time for weaning should be fixed partly by the child's age, 
partly by the growth of the teeth. The troubles to which children 
are subject at this crisis are usually gastric, such as are induced by 
summer weather; therefore at that season the weaning should be 
postponed, whereas in winter it should be hurried forward. The 
first group of teeth, nine times out of ten, consists of the lower cen- 
tral front teeth, which may appear any time during the sixth and 
seventh month. The mother may then begin to dimmish the num- 
ber of suckling times; and by a month she can have reduced them to 
twice a day, so as to be ready, when the second group makes its way 
through the upper front gums, to cut off the supply altogether. The 
third group the lateral incisors and first grinders usually after the 
first anniversary of birth give notice that solid food can be chewed. 
But it is prudent to let dairy-milk form a considerable portion of the 
fare till the eye-teeth are cut, which seldom happens till the eighteenth 
or twentieth month. At this period children are liable to diarrhoea, 
convulsions, irritation of the brain, rashes, and febrile catarrhs. In 
such cases it is often advisable to resume a complete milk-diet, and 
sometimes a child's life has been saved by its reapplication to the 
breast. These means are most feasible when the patient is accus- 
tomed to milk ; indeed, if not, the latter expedient is hardly possible. 

Diet in Childhood and Youth. At this stage of life the diet must 
obviously be the best which is a transition from that of infancy to 
that of adult age. Growth is not completed, but yet entire surren- 
der of every consideration to the claim of growth is not possible, nor 
indeed desirable. Moreover, that abundance of adipose tissue, or 
reserve new growth, which a baby can bear, is an impediment to the 
due education of the muscles of the boy or girl. The supply of nu- 
triment needs not to be so continuous as before, but at the same time 
should be more frequent than for the adult. Up to at least fourteen 
or fifteen years of age the rule should be four meals a day, varied 
indeed, but nearly equal in nutritive power and in quantity that is 
to say, all moderate, all sufficient. The maturity the body then 
reaches involves a hardening and enlargement of the bones and car- 
tilages, and a strengthening of the digestive organs, which in healthy 
young persons enables us to dispense with some of the watchful care 
bestowed upon their diet. Three full meals a day are generally suffi- 
cient, and the requirements of mental training may be allowed to a 
certain extent to modify the attention to nutrition, which has hith- 



DIET IN CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH. 333 

erto been paramount. But it must not be forgotten that the changes 
in figure and in internal organs are not completed till several years 
have passed, and that they involve increased growth and demand 
full supplies. As less bulky food is used, care should be taken that 
it is sufficiently nutritious, and habits should be acquired which con- 
duce to making the most of it for the maintenance of strength. 

The nutritiousness of food depends on digestibility and concentra- 
tion. Food is digestible when it yields readily its constituents to the 
fluids destined for their reduction to absorbable chyme. It is more 
or less concentrated, according as a given weight contains more or 
less matter capable of supporting life. The degree in which they 
possess these qualifications united constitutes the absolute nutritive 
value of alimentary matters. 

The degree of cohesion in the viands influences digestibility. 
Tough articles incapable of being completely ground up by the teeth re- 
main unused, while fluids and semifluids lead the van of digestibles. The 
tissues of young vegetables and young animals are, for this reason, 
more digestible than old specimens. It is desirable also that the post- 
mortem rigidity, which lasts several days in most instances, should 
have merged into softness before the meat is cooked, or should have 
been anticipated by cooking before the flesh is cold. In warm cli- 
mates and exceptionally warm weather, the latter course is the pref- 
erable. The dietician, especially when the feeding of the young is 
in question, will prefer those methods of culinary preparation which 
most break up the natural cohesion of the viands. And it may be 
noticed that the force of cohesion acts in all directions, and that it is 
no advantage for an article to be laterally friable if it remains stringy 
in a longitudinal direction. 

Fat interposed between the component parts of food diminishes 
its digestibility. It is the interstitial fat, between the fasciculi of 
muscular fibre in beef, which renders it to young persons, and to 
dyspeptics, less digestible than mutton. 

A temperature above that of the body retards digestion. Meat, 
which is digested by the gastric juice in the stomach, has time to 
cool before it gets there ; but farinaceous food, which depends for 
its conversion into chyme on the salivary glands, suffers a serious 
loss if, by reason of being too hot, it cannot avail itself of the saliva 
supplied by the mouth. It should also be borne in mind that a tem- 
perature much above that of the body cracks the enamel of the teeth. 



334 DIET IN HEALTH AND DISEASE. 

Excessive concentration impairs digestibility. The principal me- 
dium by which nutriment is carried through the absorbent membrane 
of the digestive canal is water. There is no doubt it passes more 
rapidly by endosmosis than anything else. The removal, then, of 
water is an injury to viands ; and drying, salting, over-frying, over- 
roasting, and even over-boiling, renders them less soluble in the 
digestive juices, and so less nutritious. A familiar illustration of this 
may be taken from eggs. Let an egg be lightly boiled, poached in 
water, custarded, or raw, and the stomach even of an invalid can 
bear it ; but let it be baked in a pudding which requires a hot oven, 
or boiled hard, or otherwise submitted to a high temperature for a 
prolonged period, and it becomes a tasteless, leathery substance, 
which can be of no more use in the stomach than so much skin or 
hair. It is obvious, then, that it is mainly in a commercial point of 
view that articles of diet can be called nutritious in proportion to 
their concentration. About this there can be no question ; milk 
adulterated from the pump is worth so much less than pure milk, 
and a pound of beef -steak sustains a man longer than a pint of veal- 
broth. 

The attainment of nutrition sness by concentration is of consid- 
erable importance to travelers and in military medicine. There are 
not a few strategists who attribute the success of the Germans in the 
war of 1870 to the easily-carried and easily-prepared food supplied 
to them by the sausage-makers of Berlin. Concentration of viands 
carried to excess, so as to be likely to affect the health, is usually 
made manifest by a diminution in the secretion of urine and its con- 
densed condition ; while, on the other hand, if dilution is needlessly 
great, the action of the kidneys is excessive. Now, the urine of 
young persons is naturally of lower specific gravity that is, more 
aqueous than that of adults. If it is found to equal in density the 
excretion of full growth, or if it is observed to be voided but rarely, 
the meals should be made more bulky, or, better still, more frequent, 
so as not to overload the stomach. 

An over-concentrated diet often induces costiveness. This should 
be counteracted by green vegetables and other dilute appetizing 
dishes, and never by purgative drugs. The habit of taking a consid- 
erable quantity and variety of fresh green vegetables has the further 
advantage of preventing that tendency to minor developments of 
scurvy which is not uncommonly found in youths nourished mainly 



DIET FOR BODILY LABOR 335 

on animal food. A softness or friability of the gums is one of the 
first signs of this. If the mouth bleeds after the application of a 
tooth-brush, the use of fresh vegetables at every meal should be 
enforced. 

The young are peculiarly liable to be affected by poisons con- 
veyed in fluids. Their sensitive frames absorb quickly, and quickly 
turn to evil account such substances, even when diluted to an extent 
which makes them harmless to adults. The water, therefore, with 
which families, and still more with which schools, are supplied, 
should be carefully subjected to analysis. Wherever a trace of lead 
is found, means should be adopted to remove the source of it ; and 
organic products should have their origin clearly accounted for, and 
all possibility of sewage contamination excluded. These precautions 
are essential, in spite of the grown-up portion of the household hav- 
ing habitually used the water without injury. 

Fresh milk has long had a bad popular reputation as occasionally 
conveying fever, and in some parts of Ireland the peasantry can 
hardly ever be got to take it u raw." This is quite irrespective of 
the state of the cattle which furnish it ; no cases of disease thus com- 
municated have ever been traced home to sick cows. It is probably 
always due either to adulteration with dirty water, or to the vessels 
being washed in that dangerous medium, or to their being exposed 
to air loaded with elements of contagion. 

Up to the period of full development, the daily use of wine should 
be allowed only during illness and the express attendance of a med- 
ical adviser. Its habitual consumption by liealthy children hastens 
forward the crisis of puberty, checks growth, and habituates them to 
the artificial sensations induced by alcohol. 

Diet for Bodily Labor. It seems certain that the old theory of 
Liebig, which attributed the whole of the force exhibited in muscu- 
lar movements to the oxidation of muscular tissue, is untenable. 
There is not enough of the material oxidized that is to say, destroyed 
and carried away as urea and other nitrogenous excretions to gen- 
erate so much force, as measured by the method of Joule. On the 
other hand, Traube goes too far when he would make out that in the 
performance of muscular work the metamorphosis of the organized 
constituents of contractile tissue is not involved, and that non-nitro- 
genous substances alone are consumed. The prolonged feats of 
walking performed by the pedestrian Weston in 1876 vastly increased 



336 DIET IN HEALTH AND DISEASE. 

the amounts excreted of those elements of the urine which are de- 
rived from the oxidation of muscle and nerve. 1 The urea formed by 
the destructive assimilation of contractile fibre, and the phosphates 
whose main source is nervous tissue, were each nearly doubled dur- 
ing and shortly after the extraordinary strain upon those parts of 
the body. As might be expected, the machinery wears away quicker 
when it is harder worked, and requires to be repaired immediately 
by an enhanced quantity of new material, or it will be worn beyond 
the power of repair. The daily supply, therefore, of digestible nitro- 
genous food meat par excellence must be increased whenever the 
muscular exercise is increased. In making the recent extension of 
railways in Sicily, the progress was retarded by the slack work done 
by the Sicilian navvies, compared with that got through by the Eng- 
lish gangs. The former took scarcely any meat, preferring to save 
the wages expended by their comrades in that way. The idea oc- 
curred to the contractor of paying the men partly in money and 
partly in meat ; and the result was a marked increase in the amount 
of work executed, which was brought nearly up to the British aver- 
age. A mixed diet, with an increase in the proportionate quantity 
of meat when extra corporeal exertion is required, is the wholesomest, 
as well as the most economical, for all sorts of manual laborers. 

It is absolutely essentjal that the fleshy machinery for doing work 
should be continuously replaced by flesh-food as it becomes worn 
out. Nitrogenous aliment, after a few chemical changes, replaces 
the lost muscle which has passed away in the excretions, just as the 
engineer makes ore into steel and renews the corroded boiler-plate 
or thinned piston. Now, as the renewal of the plate or piston is a 
" stimulus " to the augmented performances of the engine, so meat 
is a " stimulus" to augmented muscular action. Taken in a digesti- 
ble form during exertion, it allows the exertion to be continued 
longer, with greater ease and less consequent exhaustion. Accord- 
ing to the testimony of soldiers experimentally put through forced 
marches of twenty miles a day, with loads of half a hundredweight 
each, "meat extract" bears away the palm from the other reputed 
stimulants commonly compared with it viz., rum and coffee. "It 
does not put a spirit into you for a few miles only, but has a lasting 

1 See Dr..Pavy on Weston's walk, in Lancet of December 23, 18T6. The urea excreted 
when walking bore to that excreted during rest the relation of 17 to 10 ; phosphoric acid, 
19 to 10; lime, 15 to 10, etc.

effect. If I were ordered for continuous marching, and had my 
choice, I would certainly take the meat extract," said an unpreju- 
diced sergeant to Dr. Parkes, who was the conductor of the experi- 
ments alluded to. 1 

When the continuous repair of the muscular machinery is fully 
secured, the production of heat and force is most readily provided 
for by vegetable aliment, by reason of the large proportion of carbon 
which it contains. In assigning their physiological functions to the 
several sorts of food, nearly all the business of begetting active force 
should apparently be ascribed to the solid hydrocarbons, starch and 
fat, by their conversion into carbonic acid. It is not necessary to be 
acquainted with every step of the process which in the body we 
confessedly are not to appreciate the argument. It is clearly im- 
portant that these elements of diet should be furnished in sufficient 
quantity v and in a digestible form. In additions to diet made in 
consequence of additional bodily work, not only should the stimulus 
of animal food be attended to, but the bulk of starch and fat in the 
rations should be augmented even in larger proportion, for these ali- 
ments are the most direct contributors of force. 2

2 This is well illustrated by a remarkable feat performed on the Great Western Eailway 
in the summer of 1872. It was necessary to shift the rails from the broad to the narrow 
gauge on upward of 500 miles of permanent way within a fortnight. The task was enor- 
mous, for the Great Western is one of the few English lines whose rails are held down by 
bolts screwed into nuts. All these had to be unscrewed, and replaced after removing the 
heavy rail two feet About 3,000 men were employed, working double time, sometimes 
from 4 in the morning till 9 at night ; and, without one being sick or drunk, they accom- 
plished the work in the prescribed time. The scheme for generating muscular power was 
this : The men were hutted along the line, 80 as not to waste their strength by coming and 
going, and they brought with them bacon, bread, cheese, cocoa, etc., to provide their usual 
meals at usual times. But they had no boer, nor alcohol in any form. A pound and a half 
of oatmeal and half a pound of sugar was allowed extra to each man daily, and for every 
gang of twenty- one a cook was provided. The first thing done in. the morning was to 
breakfast ; and then the cook and his caldron started along the line till water was found 
convenient ; a fireplace of stones was built, and the pot boiled. Oatmeal was then sprin- 
kled into it with sugar, and thoroughly well boiled till thin gruel was made. As soon as 
the " shout for drink " was heard, buckets were filled and carried round, with small pan- 
nikins to convey the liquid to the panting mouths. The men liked it exceedingly, and 
learned by experience the importance of having it well cooked. 

The incident may remind the reader of classical medicine of Hippocrates, who considers 
the culinary preparation of oatmeal ptisan so important, that, in a short treatise " On the 
Treatment of Acute Disease," he devotes to it the only cookery recipe he has inserted in 
his works. He describes how it is to be boiled till it can swell no longer (so that it may

Training for athletic sports is based on the principles above 
enunciated. The usual time allotted to it is six weeks, and the ob- 
jects to be attained in this period may be described as 

1. The removal of superfluous fat and water. 

2. The increase of contractile power in the muscles. 

3. Increased endurance. 

4. " Wind," that is to say, a power of breathing and circulating 
the blood steadily, in spite of exertion. 

The first is aimed at by considerably adding to the daily amount 
of nitrogenous and by diminishing farinaceous and liquid food, and 
providing that it should be so consumed as to be fully digested. 
The second and third are secured by gradually increasing the de- 
mands made upon the muscles, till they have learned to exert at 
will all the powers of which they are capable, and for as long a 
period as the natural structure of the individual frame permits. 
" Wind " is improved by choosing as part of the training an exercise 
such as running, which can be sustained only when the respiratory 
and circulating organs do their duty fairly. 

As an example, the Oxford system of training for the summei 
boat-races may be cited. It may be considered a typical regimen 
for fully developing a young man's corporeal powers to fulfill the de- 
mands of an extraordinary exertion a standard which may be mod- 
ified according to the circumstances for which the training is re- 
quired. It is as follows :

swell no more in the stomach), how it is to be settled and strained through a coarse colan-

with our advanced physiologists in the opinion that overstrained muscular effort produces 
the same effect as continued fever (es irvperbv /caflt'oTarai /u.a/cpoTepov), its chief dangers 
lying in rise of temperature and arrested cutaneous action, and that its true antagonist is 
nutriment capable of rapid absorption, dissolved in that most essential nutriment, water.

The Cambridge system differs very slightly, and in neither is any 
exaggerated severity of discipline enforced, while some latitude is 
permitted to peculiarities and a wish for variety, and plenty of 
time is left for business and social intercourse. Other plans are 
objectionable, from involving, without any corresponding advantage, 
a complete departure from the usual habits of the educated classes. 
For instance, according to Clasper, dinner is to be at noon, with 
only a light tea afterward, and no supper. Then a country walk 
of four or five miles is to be taken before breakfast, and two hours' 
row afterward, and another hard row between dinner and tea. 1 
" Stonehenge," again, requires the time between breakfast and 
dinner to be spent entirely on billiards, skittles, quoits, rowing, 
and running, in spite of another hour's row being prescribed at 
6 P. M. He also requires the aspirant for athletic honors to sleep 
between ten and eleven hours. 2 Only professionals will carry out 
such rules, and even they do not either benefit their health or 
lengthen their lives by the sacrifice ; for it is notorious that " over- 
training" leads to a condition of system in which the sufferers de- 
scribe themselves as a fallen to pieces." The most peculiar symptom 
is a sudden loss of voluntary power after exertion. It is sometimes 
called " fainting," but there is no loss of sense, and it is quickly re- 
lieved by liquid food. It is to the pathologist a timely warning of 
that consequence of overstrained muscle which constitutes paralysis 
scriptorum, turner's palsy, and blacksmith's palsy, and which results 
in fatty degeneration of the red muscular fibre. To get and to keep 
its health, a muscle needs a constant alternation of active contraction 
and rest, and an enforced protraction of either one or the other leads 
to the loss of vital properties. The limbs of an Indian fakir, volun- 
tarily held in a strained posture, or those of a bed-ridden invalid, are

equally apt to become useless. Over-trained persons are also liable 
to a languor and apparent weakness, which is found, on examination, 
to depend on an excessive secretion of urea by the kidneys. 

Such are not the results, however, of the training adopted' at the 
universities, by which it would appear that the constitution is 
strengthened, the intellect sharpened, and life lengthened. Dr. John 
Morgan ("University Oars," 1873) has collected statistics of the sub- 
sequent health of those who have rowed in the university races since 
1829, and he finds that, whereas at twenty years of age, according to 
Farr's life tables, average expectation of survival is forty years, for 
these oarsmen it is forty-two years. Moreover, in the cases of death, 
inquiry into its causes exhibits evidence of good constitutions rather 
than the contrary, the causes consisting largely of fevers and acci- 
dents, to which the vigorous and active are more exposed than the 
sick. And it is not at the expense of the mind that the body is cul- 
tivated, for this roll of athletes is adorned with the names of bishops, 
poets, queen's counsel, etc. 

Training greatly increases the vital capacity of the chest, so that 
much more air can be blown in and out of the lungs, and with greater 
force, than previously. And this vital capacity endures longer than 
the other improvements. It is evidence of the permanent elasticity 
of the pulmonary tissue, and an efficient protection against asthma, 
emphysema, and other degenerations of the organ of breathing. 

Indigestion, sleeplessness, nervous indecision, palpitation of heart, 
and irregularity of bowels, disappear under training; but if they 
exist, -the regimen should be entered on with more than usual caution. 

An important modification of training is that which contemplates 
the reduction of corpulence which has increased to the extent 
of interfering with comfort and preventing active exercise. If an 
exhausting amount of muscular effort is enforced, the digestion of 
meat is interfered with, while at the same time there still goes on 
the absorption of such fat as is unavoidably present in the victuals, 
so that the muscles and nerves lose strength, while the adipose tissue 
grows. Besides this, if by violent means the weight is worked down, 
then, to keep it down, those violent means must be persisted in ; 
and if they be neglected for more interesting occupations, the burden 
rapidly increases to a greater degree than ever. Many uncomfortably 
obese persons are very active in mind and body, and could not add 
to their muscular exercise without risk of harm. 



THE REDUCTION OF CORPULENCE. 

Kegimen, then, is more essentially important to them than to 
other trainers, and they will probably be more induced to attend to 
it if they understand the principles on which it is based. This is 
simply to exclude from the bill of fare all those articles which con- 
tain fat, or which, by the chemical actions of the digestive viscera, 
may be converted into fat. 

For the reduction of corpulence, the following rules may be ob- 
served for a three weeks' course : 

Eise at 7, rub the body well with horse-hair gloves, have a cold 
bath, and take a short turn in the open air. Breakfast (alone) at 8 
or 8.30, on the lean of beef or mutton (cutting off the fat and skin), 
dry toast, biscuit or oat-cake, a tumbler of claret and water, or tea 
without milk or sugar, or made in the Eussian way, with a slice of 
lemon. Lunch at 1 on bread or biscuit, Dutch cheese, salad, water- 
cresses or roasted apples, hung beef or anchovies, or red-herring, or 
olives, and similar relishes. After eating, drink claret and water, or 
unsweetened lemonade, or plain water, in moderation. Dine at any 
convenient hour. Avoid soup, fish, or pastry, but eat plain meat of 
any sort except pork, rejecting the fat and skin. Spinach, haricots, 
or any other green vegetable, may be taken, but no potatoes, made 
dishes, or sweets. A jelly, or a lemon-water-ice, or a roast apple, 
must suffice in their place. Take claret and water at dinner, and one 
glass of sherry or Madeira afterward. 

Between meals, as a rule, exercise must always be taken to the 
extent of inducing perspiration. Eunning, when practicable, is the 
best form in which to take it. 

Seven or eight pounds is as much as it is prudent to lose during 
the three weeks. If this loss is arrived at sooner, or indeed later, 
the severe parts of the treatment may be gradually omitted ; but 
it is strongly recommended to modify the general habits in accord- 
ance with the principle of taking as small a quantity as possible of 
fat and sugar, or of substances which form fat and sugar, and sus- 
taining the respiratory function. By this means the weight may be 
gradually reduced for a few months with safety. 

Small quantities of dilute alcoholic liquids taken with meals 
slightly increase the activity of the renewal of the nitrogenous tissues, 
mainly muscle ; that is to say, there is a more rapid reconstruction 
of those parts, as is shown by the augmented formation of urea and 
the sharpened appetite. Life is fuller and more complete, old flesh 



342 DIET IN HEALTH AND DISEASE. 

is removed, and food appropriated as new flesh, somewhat more 
quickly than when no alcohol is ingested. There appears to he a 
temporary rise in the digestive powers of the stomach, which is prob- 
ably the initiative act. The nerve-functions are blunted, and a less- 
ened excretion of phosphorus exhibits a temporary check in the 
wear and renewal of the nerve-tissue. The " vital capacity " of the 
lungs, as indicated by the spirometer, is reduced, showing a dimin- 
ished oxidation of the blood. 

The effect on a healthy man of taking with a meal such a quan- 
tity of fermented liquor as puts him at ease with himself and the 
world around, without untoward exhilaration, is to arrest the wear of 
the nervous system, especially that part employed in emotion and 
sensation. Just as often, then, as the zest for food is raised to its 
normal standard by a little wine or beer with a meal, the moderate 
consumer is as much really better as he feels the better for it. 
Where the food is as keenly enjoyed without it, the consumption of 
a stimulant is useless. But alcohol is not a source of force, and its 
direct action is an arrest of vitality. 

Diet for Mental Work. An expression of Btichner's "No think- 
ing without phosphorus " * has gained an unhappy notoriety. 
Strictly speaking, it is a groundless assumption, for we cannot say 
that intellectual being may not exist joined to any form of matter, or 
quite independent of matter. We certainly do not know enough of 
the subject to lay down such a negative statement. And if it be held 
to mean that the amount of phosphorus passing through the body 
bears a proportion to the intensity of thought, it is simply a mis- 
statement. A captive lion, tiger, leopard, or hare assimilates and 
parts with a greater amount of phosphorus than a hard-thinking 
man, while a beaver, noted for its powers of contrivance, excretes 
so little phosphorus that chemical analysis cannot find it in the 
excreta. All that the physiologist is justified in asserting is that, for 
the mind to energize in a living body, that body must be kept living 
up to a certain standard, and that for the continuous renewal of life 
a supply of phosphatic salts is required. The same may be said with 
equal justice of water, fat, nitrogen, chloride of sodium, oxygen, etc. 
The phosphates are wanted indeed, but wanted by pinches, whereas 
water is required by pailfuls. A few days without water, or a few

DIET FOR MENTAL WORK. 343 

minutes without oxygen, will terminate the train of consciousness. 
The practical points taught us by physiology are that, for the integ- 
rity of thought, integrity of the nervous tissue is requisite ; and for 
the integrity of the nervous tissue, a due quantity of such food as 
contains digestible phosphatic salts. 

The most perfect regimen for the healthy exercise of thought is 
such as would be advised for a growing boy viz., frequent small 
supplies of easily-soluble mixed food, so as to furnish the greatest 
quantity of nutriment without overloading the stomach, or running 
the risk of generating morbid half-assimilated products. For it is 
essential to the intellectual direction of the nervous system that it 
should not be oppressed by physical impediments. The presence in 
the stomach or blood of imperfectly assimilated nutriment impedes 
its functions in close proportion to their amount, so that not only 
the constituents, but the mode of administering food, must come into 
the calculation. " Repletw venter non studet libenter" is an old 
proverb, the application of which saves many a brain and many a 
stomach from being worked against the grain. Rest from brain- 
work for twenty minutes before meals, entire abstinence from it 
during meals, and rest again till the weight has passed from the 
stomach, are essential to the reconcilement of psychical exertion 
with bodily health. 

The physiology of the action of alcohol has a very important 
bearing on the physical management of the mental functions. Alco- 
hol has the power of curbing, arresting, and suspending all the man- 
ifestations of the nervous system, so that we feel its influence on our 
thoughts sooner than on any other part of the system. Sometimes 
it brings them more completely under our command, controls and 
steadies them; more often it confuses or disconnects them, and 
then breaks oS. our power over them altogether. When a man has 
tired himself by intellectual exertion, a moderate quantity of alco- 
holic stimulant taken with food acts as an anaesthetic, stays the wear 
of the system which is going on, and allows the nerve-force to be 
turned to the due digestion of the meal. But it must be followed by 
rest from toil, and is in essence a part of the same treatment which 
includes rest it is an artificial rest. To continue to labor, and at 
the same time to take an anaesthetic, is a physiological inconsistency. 
The drug merely blunts the useful feeling of weariness, and prevents 
it from acting as a warning. There is no habit more fatal to a lit- 
16 



34:4: DIET IN HEALTH AND DISEASE. 

erary man than that of taking stimulants between meals ; the vital 
powers go on wearing out more and more, without their cry for help 
being perceived, and in the end break down irrevocably. 

As to quantity, the appetite for solid food is the safest guide. If 
a better dinner or supper is eaten when it is accompanied by a cer- 
tain amount of fermented liquor, that is the amount most suitable ; 
if a worse, then an excess is committed, however little be taken. 

The aim of the diet should be (to quote the words of John Mil- 
ton) " to preserve the body's health and hardness, to render light- 
some, clear, and not lumpish obedience to the mind, to the cause of 
religion and our country's liberty, when it shall require from hearts 
in sound bodies to stand and cover their stations." 

It is especially when the mind of genius is overshadowed by the 
dark clouds of threatened insanity, of hypochondriasis, or of hysteria, 
that a rational mode of life preserves it. Nothing but daily exercise, 
temperate meals, and a punctual observance of regular hours of rest 
and study, could have kept burning the flickering reason in poor 
Cowper. 

As regards the proper quantity of alcohol that may be used, the 
two following questions naturally occur : How is a man to know 
when he has had enough? and what are the signs of too much? The 
ancients used to wear dark-red or purple engraved gems, which they 
considered preservatives against excess, and called them a/ueOvcrol 
"sober-stones," " amethysts." The name is now limited to the vio- 
let rock-crystal, but in early times it was applied to several other 
stones, cut in intaglio, and worn on the fingers at festive gatherings. 
So long as the wearer could decipher the minute works of art they 
bore, he had not reached excess. A more delicate test still is the 
appreciation of temperature by the skin; if a draught does not chill, 
if a hot room fails to produce the usual discomfort, the wise man 
knows he has exceeded and must stop at once. In short, the safest 
rule is that, when there is a consciousness of any psychical effect at 
all beyond that of satisfaction at the relief of bodily weariness such 
a satisfaction as is felt on taking a good meal by a vigorous person 
then the limits of moderation have been attained. On ordinary 
occasions of daily life, and " for the stomach's sake," no more 
should be taken. Each fresh drop is a step downward to the evil 
results of alcohol. But to the practiser of daily temperance, festive 
occasions are safe and may be beneficial. A man may, from time to 



DIET OF MOTHERS. 345 

time, keep up without harm the above-mentioned sense of satisfac- 
tion by good and digestible wine in good company, without fear of 
getting drunk or failure of health, if he makes it a law to himself to 
stop as soon as he experiences any hurry of ideas or indistinctness of 
the senses. 

Diet of Mothers. During pregnancy as much care should be taken 
not to get too fat as is taken by an athlete training for a race. The 
rules for modified training explained above will afford hints on the 
subject, but it is not desirable to carry the process so far. 

There is a temptation at this time to increase the usual allowance 
of stimulant; alcohol is taken between meals to overcome the nausea 
and depression incident to the state of body. And by this mistaken 
expedient the nausea gradually becomes dyspeptic vomiting. On 
leaving it off, the sickness ceases. A mother should also remember 
that nearly all the alcohol she consumes mixes with her blood, which 
now is one with the blood of the foetus. 

During lactation the most suitable drink for a mother is cow's 
milk, fresh and unskimmed. If it turns sour on the stomach, lime- 
water mixed with it not only corrects the acescence, but also supplies 
a valuable aid to the growing bones of the infant. In her solid diet- 
ary, also, milk may be fairly taken as the type of a due admixture of 
alimentary principles, because it is not individual growth or the pro- 
duction of muscular force, but the secretion of milk, that is the ob- 
ject of the selection of diet. 

Supposing the full diet to consist of three pounds of solid food, 
that will require six pints extra of uncombined aqueous fluid to make 
it as fluid as milk ; and, to combine the nitrogenous and carbonaceous 
constituents in due proportion, the three pounds of solid food should 
consist of 

14$ ounces of meat. 
13 ounces of fat, butter, and sugar. 
20 ounces of farinaceous food and vegetables. 
J ounce of salt, lime, etc. 

At first, from the exhaustion consequent on childbed, from the 
want of exercise and of fresh air, the appetite turns against meat. 
Let then milk, especially boiled milk, with arrow-root or the like, 
chicken-broth, or egg-custards, fill up the deficiency. 

Any increase in the habitual allowance of alcohol is as unfitting 
to this period of life as during pregnancy. 



346 DIET IN HEALTH AND DISEASE. 

Diet of Old Age. It is a remark extant from the rough times, 
when famine was more frequent than now, that the older a human 
being is the better deficiency of food is borne. Old men suffer least 
from abstinence, 1 and benefit therefore most from temperance in eat- 
ing. Everybody who has passed the age of fifty, or thereabouts, with 
a fairly unimpaired constitution, will act wisely in diminishing his 
daily quantity of solid food. There is less demand for the materials 
of growth, and consequently animal food should bear a smaller pro- 
portion than heretofore to vegetable, and it is mainly in that ingredi- 
ent of the diet that reduction should be effected. Neglect of this 
rule in declining years is often punished by gout a disease attribu- 
table to excess of nitrogenous aliment, and for this reason common 
to elderly men. 

In the autumn of life, the advantages derived from fermented 
liquor are more advantageous, and the injuries it can inflict less in- 
jurious, to the body than in youth. The effect of alcohol is to check 
the activity of destructive assimilation, to arrest that rapid flux of 
the substance of the frame which, in healthy youth, can hardly be 
excessive, but which, in old age, exhausts the vital force. Loss of 
appetite is a frequent and a serious symptom in old age. It usually 
arises from deficient formation of gastric juice, which, in common 
with other secretions, diminishes with years. It is best treated phys- 
iologically rather than by drugs. 

Diet in Sickness. In all that has gone before, health has been pre- 
supposed. The modifications necessitated by sickness are of three 
kinds: 1. The avoidance of such articles of consumption as would 
increase the disease under the special circumstances, although ordi- 
narily wholesome ; 2. The maintenance of the functions or parts of 
the frame which remain normal ; 3. The administration, for a special 
curative purpose, of peculiar food which would not be recommended 
for general use. 

In sM fevers which are classed together as being apparently due to 
a poison multiplying itself in the blood, the art of diet consists in 
giving an almost continuous supply of liquid nutriment, holding very 
soluble aliments in a dilute form. There is nothing so digestible as 
water, and we take advantage of this high digestibility to get what- 
ever it can dissolve digested along with it. For the first three or 

1 Hippocrates, Aphorism xiii. 



DIET IN FEVER. 347 

even four days, patients, previously strong, should have only farina- 
ceous food, well boiled and cooled to the temperature of the body. 
Evidence has been already quoted of the power which oatmeal-gruel 
possesses of sustaining force under the trying circumstances of ex- 
cessive toil. Now, fever closely resembles muscular effort in its arrest 
of the digestive functions, at the same moment that it makes an ur- 
gent demand for nutriment. With ultra-Egyptian rigor, while straw 
is withheld, "the tale of the bricks is doubled," and we know by the 
quantity of urea and phosphates in the urine, and by the foecal excre- 
tion, that the muscles and nerves of the bed-ridden sufferer are melt- 
ing away as fast as if he were scaling the Alps with nothing to eat. 
It is quite reasonable to transfer the experiences derived from health 
to sickness, and to feel satisfied that we are not wasting precious op- 
portunities when we are giving fever-patients such a time-honored 
diet as oatmeal-gruel, care being taken that it is thoroughly well 
boiled. After three days, the tissues are beginning to suffer, and it 
is advisable to add chicken- broth, meat- jelly, and strong soup. Let 
that be supplied which the emaciation shows to be passing away 
nitrogenous tissue. 

The administration of alcohol is to be regulated partly by the 
temperature and partly by the condition of the nervous system. Usu- 
ally, if the heat of the blood (as taken at the axilla) is above 103, 
and always if it is above 105, there is a necessity for it. Again, if 
there is great prostration of strength, or tremor of the hands, or 
quivering in the voice and respiration, if there is low muttering de- 
lirium when the patient is left quiet, it is required. 

Green-sickness, or ansemia, is characterized by the rapid disappear- 
ance of the red particles which float in the blood. To what a strange 
extent this goes may be seen by looking at the insides of the lips, 
which naturally hold such a quantity of the fluid as to be quite scar- 
let, but which now are pale like those of a corpse. It is calculated 
that the loss of material in marked cases of green-sickness may 
amount to three pounds of this important constituent of the blood. 1 
Yet it is capable of complete renewal by diet. If by dint of reme- 
dies, notably iron, the appetite can be so regulated as to enjoy meat 
in excess of the immediate wants of the body, that meat is converted 
into hsematine, and the healthy hue returns to the cheeks as quickly 

1 Chambers^ " Lectures," chiefly Clinical, lect. 11. 



DIET IX HEALTH AND DISEASE. 

as it left it. "Wine is useful at meals on account of the stimulus 
it gives to the appetite; it is injurious between meals by spoil- 
ing it. 

Acute rheumatism and acute gout are best treated on an opposite 
principle. A nutrient nitrogenous diet, which the patient assimilates 
only too readily, retards recovery, and will even bring on a relapse 
during convalescence. If meat in any form, solid or liquid, be eaten, 
it seems to turn to acid, which is already in excess in the blood. The 
power of fully converting it into living flesh is wanting; and, until 
this power is regained, a semi-conversion into an organic acid takes 
place. The redder and more muscular the meat is, the more it dis- 
agrees. 

Chronic gout is indubitably due to good cheer indulged in either 
by the sufferer or his ancestors. When a man, day after day, swal- 
lows more nitrogenous food than is wanted for the repair of his tis- 
sues, the following results may be expected, with variations depend- 
ent upon his original constitution : If the digestive solvents are weak 
and scanty, the excess passes through the canal in an undigested 
state, and is partially decomposed there. Thereon ensue all sorts of 
abdominal derangements, which, however, have the advantage of 
getting rid of the offending matters. If, on the other hand, the 
stomach secretes vigorously on being stimulated, then, indeed, the 
excess is digested and absorbed, and is subject to the future changes 
consequent on assimilation. An active out-of-door life neutralizes 
this in some measure by augmenting oxidation ; much of the albumen 
goes to form glycogen, and acts as a fuel for the maintenance of mus- 
cular force. The balance is wasted in an unexplained way, and does 
not necessarily injure a hardy frame. The violent muscular exertion 
and high training needful for oxidation being inconsistent with the 
habits of intellectual society, a man in the prime of life who puts too 
much meat into a good stomach habitually retains in his blood an ex- 
cess of uric acid, into which the nitrogenous waste converts itself. 
Uric acid in the blood has been distinctly traced as the essence of 
gout. Perhaps this imaginary first offender develops the full con- 
sequences; and that is the best thing that can happen, inducing 
greater carefulness in future. 

These views can suggest but one line of preventive treatment : 
The children of gouty families should be brought up to a life of strict 
abstemiousness and muscular activity. From the earliest years vege- 



REGIMEN IN GOUTY CONDITIONS. 349 

tables and " meagre " soups should form a considerable portion of 
their dietary. 

Gouty adults require meat but once in twenty-four hours. The 
bill of fare should be varied from day to day, but as simple as pos- 
sible at each meal. Rich sauces are to be eschewed, and a lemon, an 
infusion of herbs and pepper, bread-sauce, or a puree of vegetables, 
adopted in their place. Sugar, at the end of meals, generates an ex- 
cess of organic acid, and it is to be avoided. If cheese is eaten, it 
should be new, and is best toasted and creamed. 

Dilute alkaline waters containing soda, such as Apollinaris or the 
weaker Vichy, are a rational drink during meals ; but it is probably 
best to keep to pure water. Those who live idle lives require no al- 
cohol, and it should not be an habitual accompaniment to meals. 

Red gravel is evidence of a constitution so closely allied to gout, 
that nothing need be said further about its appropriate regimen. 

In Brighfs disease of the kidneys, in contracted liver, and, in 
short, in all degenerative lesions, alcohol has a baneful influence. Its 
action upon the tissues is directly the same as theirs. Moreover, if 
we agree with its latest expositor, Dr. Sibson, that Bright's disease 
is closely associated with increased arterial tension, alcohol (whose 
effect is also to increase tension) must be peculiarly poisonous. * 

For the cure of these diseases, independent of the nutrition of the 
rest of the body, a milk diet has been proposed, and it seems to offer 
a fair prospect, if the patients can be persuaded to persist in it. How 
safely a milk diet may be adopted in middle life is shown by the ex- 
ample of Dr. Cheyne, a Bath physician of the last century, who, at 
about fifty-five, restricted himself entirely to milk and biscuits, and 
yet was able to fulfill the duties of his laborious profession. He took 
at first of the former six pints, of the latter twelve ounces; but he 
shortly diminished the quantity to half, and, after sixteen years' ex- 
perience, found it fully sufficient, and indeed capable of further re- 
duction in quantity. 2 

Weak and slow digestion is a condition which enforces an especial 
care for meat and drink. The cause of the imperfection lies in a 
deficiency in the supply of nerve-power to the stomach, so that it 
both secretes its solvent fluid and also rotates its contents too slowly ;

and the more it is loaded the slower it goes. Of the medicinal means 
of curing such a state, this is not the place to speak ; but none of 
them will avail without the aid of a rational dietary. Time must be 
given to the oppressed organ wherein to empty itself of every com- 
plete meal, and such a period of rest given as will allow of the re- 
covery of force ; or, if the meals are frequent, they must be very 
sparing. The observations of Busch (Virchow's "Archiv," xiv.) 
show that a period of five hours elapses in the healthy subject be- 
fore a fully filled stomach can empty itself, and in the dyspeptic the 
process is still longer. Whenever, therefore, the organ is loaded as 
healthy people rightly load it, a man should allow at least seven or 
eight hours to elapse before sitting down to- another meal, and he 
must never eat till the need for food is announced by appetite. Per- 
haps a more generally applicable and easier-obeyed law is not to 
make full meals at all, but to stop short at the feeling of repletion, 
and, when that has gone off, again to take in the supply allowed by 
circumstances. Three moderate meals are usually sufficient to keep 
up the strength. 

Meat should be once cooked. Mutton, feathered fowl, venison, 
lamb, and beef are digestible in the order they here are placed in. 
The more difficult dishes should have the longest time allowed to 
them. Of the farinaceous articles of diet, bread and biscuits are 
the most easily penetrated by the gastric juices, and all their prep- 
arations are safe. The best bread is the " aerated," which is free 
from decomposing yeast. Macaroni is good if soaked till quite ma- 
cerated. Pastry is difficult of solution. Vegetables are very neces- 
sary; cauliflowers, Jerusalem artichokes, beet-root, French beans, 
soft peas, stewed celery, turnip-tops, spinach, are the most readily 
disposed of. 

When the usual mixture of meat and vegetables is found to in- 
duce flatulence, it is a good expedient to eat vegetables only at one 
meal and meat and bread only at another. The principle on which 
this plan is based is that starchy food is dissolved mainly by the al- 
kaline saliva, whereas meat is dissolved by the acid gastric juice. 
In a vigorous person both are copious enough to render immaterial 
their mutual neutralization ; but when they are scanty, their separate 
employment is a physiological economy. 

Consumption is a disease whose treatment is almost wholly die- 
tetic. The children of a mother whose pedigree exhibits proof of a

consumptive tendency may with propriety be put to a healthy wet- 
nurse immediately on birth, and, on being weaned, be fed from a 
Channel Island cow. The milk should be boiled and then cooled 
down to tepidity. A small teaspoonful of " saccharated solution of 
lime " may be advantageously added to each quart of milk when the 
coming teeth require the elements of their nutrition to be added to 
the diet. The rules already given for the healthy management of 
the young should be adhered to with unusual strictness, and any 
departure from them should be made only to provide for some pecul- 
iar necessity of the case according to medical advice. 

In cases of consumption it is difficult to say that drugs are use- 
less, but certainly those that, come nearest to aliments have most 
evidence in their favor, such as iron, cod-liver oil, and the phos- 
phates of lime. Their effect on the appetite must be sedulously 
watched, and the end must not be sacrificed to the means ; that is 
to say, if they spoil the appetite, they must be left off. The reason 
for administering oil is to afford an easily assimilated basis of re- 
newed organic growth, to take the place of the abnormal tendency 
to form tubercular matter. If anything prevents its easy assimila- 
tion it is obviously useless. The use of climate in the treatment of 
phthisis may be tested by its dietetic action ; if it improves the ap- 
petite it is doing good ; if it injures the appetite it is doing harm. 

In chronic jaundice the function of the liver is best restored by 
the free use of green vegetables at all meals. 

Diabetes, when it has once assumed a chronic form, is never 
really cured, but life may be much prolonged by the employment of 
a diet from which sugar and starch are excluded as far as practi- 
cable, and the patient nourished on animal food. The best fare for 
diabetic patients is that given by Prof. Bouchardat in his work " Du 
Diabete sucrSe," Paris, 1852. 

In functional nervous diseases, such as hysteria and hypochon- 
driasis, the appetite, muscular elasticity, and mental powers will 
often be observed to be deficient in the early part of the day, and to 
recover their tone in the evening. At this latter time, therefore, it 
is advisable to make the principal meal. 

Scurvy is a notable example of a disease of which, more than 
any other, the prevention depends on the adoption of a suitable 
diet. Its symptoms so far resemble those of general starvation that, 
from the earliest time of its appearance in history, it has been sus- 



352 DIET IN HEALTH AND DISEASE. 

pected that it is due to a dietary defective in some necessary ingre- 
dient ; and practical observation soon showed that this was fresh 
vegetables. It was found on every long voyage that the crew suffered 
from scurvy in proportion to the length of time they were restricted 
to dry food, and that they recovered rapidly as soon as they got 
access to a supply of succulent plants. This requisite for health is 
obviously the most difficult of all things to procure aboard ship, and 
efforts were made to find a substitute capable of marine transport. 
From the time of Hawkins x (1593) downward the opinion has been 
expressed, by all the most intelligent travelers, that a substitute is 
to be found in the juice of fruits of the orange tribe, such as oranges, 
lemons, etc. But in its natural state this is expensive and trouble- 
some to carry, so that skippers and owners for a couple of centu- 
ries found it expedient to be skeptical. The pictures of scurvy as it 
appeared during the eighteenth century are horrible in the extreme. 
But the statute of 1795, passed through the exertions of Captain 
Cook and Sir Gilbert Blane, has enforced the carrying of lime-juice. 
This invaluable preventive has shown its influence all the more de- 
cidedly by the disease still appearing occasionally under strong pro- 
moting circumstances, and to a certain extent in spite of the anti- 
dote ; but it is so modified as to be usually more of the nature of a 
warning or demonstration than of a serious invasion. Some, indeed, 
have questioned and even denied altogether the blessings derived 
from the enforced use of lime-juice. But they make a very scanty 
show wh'en weighed with those whom they undertake to oppose; 
and it is superfluous here to enter into the arguments and results of 
observation constituting the ponderous " Report of the Committee 
appointed by the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to inquire 
into the Causes of the Outbreak of Scurvy in the Recent Arctic Ex- 
pedition, etc., and presented to both Houses of Parliament, May 7, 
1877," which seems to settle forever the preventive powers against 
scurvy of the use of lime-juice. 

The committee alluded to was appointed in consequence of one 
of those exceptional outbreaks of scurvy induced by exceptional cir- 
cumstances. The ships sent on the exploring expedition of 1875 
were amply provided with lime-juice, and with printed expositions 
of its value. During the voyage out and in the long inaction of the

INFLUENCE OF FOOD IN SCURVY. 353 

winter, the men's health was so well preserved by general attention 
to hygiene that no cases of even mild scurvy were detected ; the 
pallor and languor and depression of spirits of some among the 
sailors were attributed to the want of sunlight for 142 days, and it 
was expected that a few days' sledge traveling in the open air would 
reinvigorate them. There was plenty of lime-juice aboard ; but it 
seems that it is not the custom to add to the weight of provisions 
which polar sledging-parties have to propel, by including the pre- 
servative among them. Sir George Nares, the commander of the 
expedition, cites the names of 10 admirals, 10 doctors, and 15 'cap- 
tains, who have conducted land explorations in this fashion without 
it ; and they returned unscathed to any serious extent. But on this 
recent occasion the crews seem to have been peculiarly predisposed to 
illnesses of scorbutic nature by the more than ordinary scarcity of fresh 
meat in their dietary, arising out of the deficiency of game in the 
extremely high latitude where they wintered. With few exceptions 
the whole of the crews of the Alert and the Discovery were em- 
ployed in sledging, and the consequence was, that of the 122 officers 
and men 59 were more or less incapacitated by scurvy, and four died. 

The real reason for not carrying lime-juice in such expeditions is 
its cumbersomeness. Including bottles, though in truth they are 
not wanted in a hard frost, it may be said that one pound a week for 
each man would have to be added to the baggage 1 a serious item, 
no doubt. And with a view of remedying the inconvenience, medi- 
cal men have long sought to discover to what constituent of the com- 
plicated mixture afforded by Nature it is that it owes its efficacy. In 
a contribution to the Medico- Chirurgical Review for 1848, Dr. Parkes 
examined exhaustively the evidence concerning the various deficien- 
cies in ship-food as compared with fresh food, which might be filled 
up by one or other of the components of lime-juice ; and by exclu- 
sion he is led to the conclusion that the cause of scurvy is to be 
found in deficiency of salts whose acids form carbonates in the sys- 
tem, viz., citric, tartaric, acetic, lactic, and malic acids. 

Though not so good as when in their natural form, because less 
digestible and pleasant, yet a supply of citrates, tartrates, lactates, 
and malates of potash might be packed in small bulk, and, under 

1 In merchant-ships lime-juice is used during polar service in a ration of an ounce 
daily. See " Report " above cited. But the opinions of the officers examined seem to 
agree that the quantity is not sufficient, and adviie half as much again, or more. 



354 DIET IN HEALTH AND DISEASE. 

circumstances where weight is of importance, might take the place 
of lime-juice. Or bolo-lozenges might be made of lime-juice freed 
from its aqueous portion and preserved with sugar. Three or four 
of these a day might be easily swallowed without stopping work. 

Before leaving the subject of maritime scurvy, it may be sug- 
gested how useful it would be if those who sail in desolate regions 
were to carry seeds of antiscorbutic vegetables, which, strewed broad- 
cast in uninhabited places, would form a flora capable of saving the 
lives of many a wrecked or weather-bound crew. 

Scurvy, as landsmen see it in time of peace, amounts to little 
more than anaemia, with a softening and bleeding condition of the 
gums ; but it indicates the use of exactly the same preventives and 
remedies as the more severe complaint, 

Starvation is a disease which it is a platitude to say may be pre- 
vented by diet ; nevertheless there are connected with it a few pecul- 
iarities of scientific and practical interest which may not be unwor- 
thy of notice. " Inedia," as it is called in the nomenclature of 
diseases by the London College of Physicians, is of two kinds, aris- 
ing from want of food and from want of water. 

When entirely deprived of nutriment the human body is capable 
of supporting life under ordinary circumstances for little more than 
a week. In the spring of 1869 this was tried on the person of a 
" fasting girl " in South "Wales. The parents made a show of their 
child, decking her out like a bride cxn a bed, : and asserting that she 
had eaten no food f6r two years. Some reckless enthusiasts for 
truth set four trustworthy hospital nurses to watch her ; the Celtic 
obstinacy of the parents was roused, and in defense of their impost- 
ure they allowed death to take place in eight days. Their trial and 
conviction for manslaughter may be found in the daily periodicals of 
the date; but, strange to say, the experimental physiologists and 
nurses escaped scot-free. There is no doubt that in this instance the 
unnatural quietude, the grave-like silence, and the dim religious 
light in which the victim was kept, contributed to defer death. 

One thing which remarkably prolongs life is a supply of water. 
Dogs furnished with as much as they wished to drink were found 
by M. Chossat (" Sur PInanition," Paris, 1843) to live three times as 
long as those who were deprived of solids and liquids at the same 
time. Even wetting the skin with sea-water has been found useful 
by shipwrecked sailors. Four men and a boy of fourteen who got 



PROLONGING LIFE IN STARVATION. 355 

shut in Tynewydd mine, near Forth, in South Wales, in the winter 
of 18Y6-'77, for ten days without food, were not only alive when 
released, but several of them were able to walk, and all subsequently 
recovered. The thorough saturation of the narrow space with aque- 
ous vapor, and the presence of drain-water in the cutting, were 
probably their chief preservatives, assisted by the high, even tem- 
perature always found in the deeper headings of coal-mines, and by 
the enormous compression of the confined air. This, doubtless, pre- 
vented evaporation, and retarded vital processes dependent upon 
oxidation. The accumulation of carbonic acid in the breathed air 
would also have a similar arrestive power over destructive assimila- 
tion. These prisoners do not seem to have felt any of the severer 
pangs of hunger, for they were not tempted to eat their candles-. 
With the instinctive feeling that darkness adds a horror to death, 
they preferred to use them for light. 

It is a paradoxical fact that the supply of the stomach even from 
the substance of the starving individual's body should tend to pro- 
long life. In April, 1874, a case was recorded of exposure in an open 
boat for thirty-two days of three men and two boys, with only ten 
days' provisions, exclusive of old boots and jelly-fish. They had a 
fight in their delirium, and one was severely wounded. As the blood 
gushed out he lapped it up ; and instead of suffering the fatal weak- 
ness which might have been expected from the hemorrhage, he seems 
to have done well. Experiments have been performed by a French 
physiologist, M. Anselmier ("Archives Gen. de Medecine," 1860, 
vol. i., page 169), with the object of trying to preserve the lives of 
dogs by what he calls " artificial autophagy." He fed them on the 
blood taken from their own veins daily, depriving them of all other 
food, and he found that the fatal cooling incident to starvation was 
thus postponed and existence prolonged. Life lasted till the emacia- 
tion had proceeded to six-tenths of the animal's weight, as in Ohos- 
sat's experiments, extending to the fourteenth day, instead of ending 
on the tenth day, as was the case with other dogs which were not 
bled. 

These instances of the application of the art of dietetics to the 
treatment of disease are sufficient to show the principles which 
should be kept in sight. The pathology of the ailment should be 
considered first, then its bearing upon the digestive organs, and last- 
ly the bearing of the digestive organs upon it. 



356 DIET IN HEALTH AND DISEASE. 

And before quitting the subject of health as affected by diet, the 
common- sense hint may be given to those who are in good sanitary 
condition, that they cannot do better than let well alone. The most 
trustworthy security for future health is present health, and there 
is some risk of overthrowing Nature's work by overcaring. 

PLEASUEE AS AN OBJECT OF DIETETICS. 

The social importance of gratifying the palate has certainly never 
been denied in practice by any of the human race. Feasting has 
been adopted from the earliest times as the most natural expression 
of joy, and the readiest means of creating joy. If ascetics have 
seemed to put the pleasure away from them, they have done so in 
the hope of purchasing by their sacrifice something greater and 
nobler, and have thus tacitly conceded, if not exaggerated, its real 
value. Experience shows that its indulgence, unregulated by the 
laws which govern our progress in civilization, leads to unutterable 
degradation and meanness, brutalizes the mind, and deadens its per- 
ception of the repulsiveness of vice and crime. But that is no cause 
why this powerful motive power, governed by right reason, should 
not be made subservient to the highest purposes. 

The times of meals must be regulated with a regard to the dis- 
posal of the remainder of the day, whether that depends on choice 
or on necessity. Violent exertion of either mind or body retards 
digestion ; and, therefore, when this is practised, food is not called 
for so soon as on a day of rest. The heaviest meal should be post- 
poned till the day's work is done ; it is then that social home joys 
give the requisite repose to the body and mind. Light eaters may 
dine as late as they please, but those of larger appetite should 
lengthen the interval between their repast and bedtime. After 
the night's sleep and the long fast which has emptied the digestive 
canal of its nutritive contents, a breakfast should be taken before 
any of the real business of life be begun. It is no proof of health 
or vigor to forego it without inconvenience ; but it is a proof of 
health and vigor to be able to lay in then a solid foundation for the 
day's labor. Not less than four and not more than six hours should 
elapse before the store is again replenished. A light, farinaceous 
lunch, with vegetables and fruit, may be made most appetizing, and 
is followed by a cheerful afternoon, whereas a ponderous meat and 
wine meal entails heaviness of spirit. 



ECONOMICAL DIETETICS. 357 



DIET IN KELATION TO ECONOMY. 

Due Proportion of Animal and Vegetable Food. It has been 
taken for granted thus far that the mixed fare, which has met the 
approval of so many generations of men, is that which is most in 
accordance with reason. But there are physiologists who argue 
that our teeth resemble those of the vegetable-feeding apes more 
than those of any other class of animal, and that, therefore, our 
most appropriate food must be of the fruits of the earth. 1 And if 
we were devoid of the intelligence which enables us to fit food for 
digestion by cookery, it is probable no diet would suit us better. 
But our reason must not be left out of account, and it is surely quite 
as natural for a man to cook and eat everything that contains in a 
convenient form starch, fat, albumen, fibre, and phosphorus, as it is 
for a monkey to eat nuts or an ox grass. The human race is natu- 
rally omnivorous. 

Moreover, man is able not only to develop his highest faculties 
and perform all his duties on any form of digestive aliment, but he 
is able also very much to diminish the requisite quantities by a due 
admixture. The diet which supplies the demand most accurately 
will be the most economical in the highest sense ; and that this diet 
is a mixed one can be shown by the following method of calculation : 
We can measure by experiment the ultimate elements of all that is 
thrown off from the body as the result of vital decomposition the 
ashes, the smoke, and the gases, which the fire of life produces; 
and thus we can lay down a rule for the minimum quantity of those 
elements which the daily food must contain to keep up the standard 
weight. If the diet be such as to make it necessary to eat too much 
of one element in order to secure a sufficient amount of another, 
there is a waste, and the digestive viscera are burdened with a use- 
less load. But there is no single article procurable for the food of 
the adult population which presents the exact proportion of elements 
required by an adult, and therefore no single article alone can supply 
human wants without waste. 

As an example, apply this reckoning to the elements carbon and 
nitrogen, which constitute the main bulk of solids in our food and 
in our bodies. Suppose a gang of 100 healthy prisoners to excrete, in 

Milne-Edwards, " Cours de Physiologie," volume vi., page 198. 



358 DIET IN HEALTH AND DISEASE. 

the shape of breathed air and evacuations, 71 pounds of carbon and 
4^ pounds of nitrogen (which is pretty nearly the actual amount of 
those elements in the dried solids of the secreta, as estimated by cur- 
rent physiological works). Both nitrogen and carbon to that extent 
must of course be supplied in the food. Now, if you fed them on 
bread only, there would be wanted daily at least 380 pounds of it to 
sustain them alive long, for it takes that weight to yield the 4 
pounds of nitrogen daily excreted ; while in the 380 pounds of bread 
there are 128| pounds of carbon, which is 57 pounds above the 
needful quantity of that substance. 1 

If, on the other hand, the bread were replaced by a purely ani- 
mal diet, there would have to be found 354 pounds of lean meat in 
order to give the 71 pounds of carbon ; and thus there would be 
wasted 105 pounds of nitrogen contained in the meat, over and 
above the 44 pounds really required to prevent emaciation. 3 

In the first case, each man would be eating about 4 pounds of 
bread, in the second, 3 pounds of meat, per diem. If he ate less, 
he would lose his strength. The first would carry about with him a 
quantity of starch, and the last a quantity of albuminous matter, not 
wanted for nutrition, and would burden the system with a useless 
mass very liable to decompose and become noxious. 

When work is undertaken, much more is actually wanted. Ac- 
cording to Mr. Yizetelly, the laborer in a Spanish vineyard consumes 
daily between 8 and 9 pounds of vegetable food, consisting of bread, 
onion-porridge, and grapes. 3 And when animal food alone is taken, 
as in the case of the Esquimaux, 20 pounds of it a day is the usual 
allowance. 

Now, if a mixed dietary be adopted for the gang of 100 prisoners 
before mentioned, 200 pounds of farinaceous food, with 56 pounds 
of animal muscle, would fulfill the requirements of the case ; 2 pounds 



1 Dr. Letheby's analysis gives 8.1 per cent, of nitrogenous matter to bread (" Lectures 
on Food," page 6). Of this one-seventh is nitrogen, Boussingault's analysis of gluten giving 
14.60 per cent. (" Annales de China, et Phys.," Ixiii., 229). M. Payen makes the propor- 
tion of nitrogen to carbon in bread as 1 to 30. 

a The proportion of nitrogen to carbon in albumen is as 1 to 3$ (15.5 to 53.5 by Mulder's 
analysis, quoted in Lehmann, " Phys. Chemie," i., 343). In red meat there is 74 per cent 
of water (ditto, iii., 96).

enough, under ordinary circumstances, for each man's daily food.

Balance of Food and Work. The most important modification to 
be made in the above estimate arises from the differences of work 
demanded. Men may exist in inaction on a scale of food-supply 
which is followed by death from starvation when they are put to 
hard labor. It is of importance, therefore, to have some measure of 
the effects of physical exertion. And here mechanical science has 
contributed to physiology a precision rarely attainable in our dealings 
with social economy. Mr. Joule, of Manchester, analyzed, about 
thirty years ago, the relation which the heat, used as a source of 
power in machinery, bore to the force of motion thus made active. 
He showed that raising the temperature of 1 pound of water 1 
Fahr. was equivalent to raising 772 pounds to the height of 1 foot ; 
and conversely, that the fall of 772 pounds might be so applied as to 
heat 1 pound of water 1 Fahr. Thus, the mechanical work repre- 
sented in lifting 772 pounds 1 foot, or 1 pound 772 feet, forms the 
"dynamic equivalent," the measure of the possible strength of 1 
of temperature as marked by the thermometer in 1 pound of water. 
Physiologists seized eagerly on the opportunity which Joule's dem- 
onstration seemed to afford them of estimating in actual numerals 
the relation of living bodies to the work they hav to do. So much 
earth raised on an embankment represents so much heat developed 
in the machinery, be it living or dead. The fully digested food, con- 
verted through several stages into gaseous, liquid, and solid excre- 
tory matters, produces by its chemical changes a definite amount of 
heat, of which a definite amount escapes, and a definite amount is 
employed in working the involuntary machinery of the body, and 
the rest is available for conversion at will into voluntary muscular 
actions. 

It may be reckoned that the daily expenditure of force in work- 
ing the machinery of the body in raising the diaphragm about 15 
times and contracting the heart about 60 times a minute, in con- 
tinuously rolling the wave of the intestinal canal, and in various 
other involuntary movements, without anything to be fairly called 



360 DIET IN HEALTH AND DISEASE. 

work it may be reckoned that the expenditure of force in doing 
this is equal to that which would raise a man of 10 stone 10,000 feet. 

There are several reasons for believing that, in assigning their 
physiological functions to the several sorts of food, nearly all the 
business of begetting force should be ascribed to the solid hydro- 
carbons, starch and oil, by their conversion into carbonic acid and 
water, just as there are good grounds for thinking that it is the con- 
version of the solid hydrocarbon of coal into the same substances 
which drives a locomotive. To the nitrogenous aliments seems al- 
lotted primarily the task of continuously replacing the wear and tear 
of the nitrogenous tissues, while any excess of them assists the starch 
and oil in keeping up the animal heat. 

One of the most cogent of the reasons for this view is that the 
chief nitrogenous excretion, the urea, is not increased in amount in 
proportion to the work done, as shown by the experiments of Messrs. 
Fink and Wiscelenus; whereas the excretion of carbonic acid in a 
decided manner follows the amount of muscular exertion. Now, it 
is very clear that, if the supply of power to do work depended on 
the decomposition and renewal of the muscles by flesh food, the 
urea must be exactly proportioned to the exertion, which is not the 
case. 

To give an example of the mode of working out a problem by 
this theory: Prof. Frankland, in a series of experiments made in 1866 
at the Royal Institution, and published in the London Philosophical 
Magazine, vol. xxxii., p. 182, ascertains with the "calorimeter" 
(which reckons the amount of heat evolved as a thermometer does 
its degree) the quantity of energy or force evolved under the form of 
heat during the oxidation of a given weight of alimentary substance. 
It has been explained that heat and mechanical work, being con- 
vertible into one another, bear a constant proportion to one another ; 
so that a definite production of so much heat invariably represents the 
potentiality of so much motion, used or wasted according to circum- 
stances. From the reading of the calorimeter, therefore, may be 
calculated how many extra pounds ought to be raised a foot high by 
a man who has eaten an extra pound of the food in question; how 
many steps a foot high he ought to raise a weight of ten stone (say 
himself) before he has worked out the value of his victuals. Prof. 
Frankland has thus estimated the comparative value of foods as bases 
of muscular exertion, and he has made out a table of the weight and

cost of various articles that would require to be consumed daily to 
enable a man to support life, the equivalent of which has been al- 
ready reckoned as the muscular force in action which would raise a 
man of 10 stone 10,000 feet.

After the supply of sufficient albuminoid matters in the food, to 
provide for the necessary renewal of the tissues, the best materials 
for the production of internal and external work are non-nitrogenous 
matters, such as oil, fat, sugar, starch, gum, etc. "When the work is 
increased, not so much extra meat as vegetable food, or its dietetic 
equivalent, fat, is demanded. 

In comparing the cost of a daily sufficiency of the various foods 
to produce the required force, we must not forget the inconveniences 
which many of them entail. These inconveniences must be added to 
the cost. For example, suppose a man to have been living upon po- 
tatoes only, just supporting life with 5 pounds a day, and then to get 
work which enabled him and required him to take a double supply 
of non-nitrogenous food, he would act unwisely if he were to swal- 



362 DIET IN HEALTH AND DISEASE. 

low it in the form of 12 pounds of cabbage. He would be knocked 
up by the sheer labor of carrying 12 pounds extra in a vessel so ill- 
adapted to. sustain heavy loads as the stomach. A similar objection 
would lie against milk or veal or apples, however cheap accident 
might make them ; and a more serious objection still would hold 
against nine bottles of ale, or seven of stout. On the other hand, the 
over-concentration of cheese, beef dripping, and lump sugar, makes 
them nauseous when in large quantity or monotonously persisted in, 
though when introduced as a variety they are appetizing and digesti- 
ble. There is no saving in using that against which the stomach is 
set, or which the absorbents refuse to assimilate. 

Ke verting to the illustration of the gang of 100 prisoners, and 
supposing it were requisite to put them on hard labor equivalent to 
half " Frarikland's unit " of 10 stone raised 10,000 feet such, for in- 
stance, as carrying up ladders, altogether 1 mile high, 3 tons of 
stone daily calculation would show that to add this amount of 
labor to the outgoings caused by the functioning of physiological life 
would involve the addition to their spare diet of at least 117 pounds 
of bread, or of 58 pounds of bread with 44 pounds of lean meat and 
63 pounds of potatoes. The slightest imperfection or indigestion of 
any of this would cause a loss of bodily weight, and cases of illness 
would be culpably frequent. "Were a draught of milk, or a cup of 
cocoa and sugar, or some oatmeal porridge and treacle, or even a 
little dripping or butter or bacon, given, the danger would probably 
be averted. 

The most conspicuous fault in the dietary of the working classes 
is want of variety. Many of the articles which combine ample nutri- 
tiousness with small cost are habitually neglected, because, when used 
exclusively, they are disagreeable and unwholesome. From never 
being eaten they become absolutely unknown. There are many sorts 
of cheap beans, vetches, and peas, unheard of except at gentlemen's 
tables, of which a complete meal may be made, or which may sup- 
port the dish of meat; while beet-root, cresses, kail, carrots, and 
other plants easily grown, are left unused. 

Quantity of Food required. The calculations of Dr. PI ay fair 
" on the food of man in relation to his useful work " 1 enable us, by 
another route, to arrive at an estimate of what amount of solid

QUANTITY OF FOOD REQUIRED. 303 

victuals is required by an adult living by bodily labor to preserve his 
health under various circumstances. The circumstances which chiefly 
affect the question can be classified thus: (1) bare existence; (2) 
moderate exercise ; (3) active work ; and (4) hard work. 

1. The first is calculated from the mean of sundry prison dietaries, 
of the convalescents' diet at hospitals, that of London needlewomen, 
and of that supplied during the Lancashire cotton famine, as reported 
by Mr. Simon. The result is that, in a condition of low health, with- 
out activity, 2J ounces of nitrogenous food, 1 ounce of fat, 12 ounces 
of starch, and J of an ounce of mineral matters a day are necessary. 
The amount of carbon in this is equal to 7.44 ounces. In other 
words, a man's life will be shortened or burdened by disease in the 
future, or he will die of gradual starvation, unless his provision for a 
week is equivalent to three pounds of meat with one pound of fat on 
it, or with the same quantity of butter or lard, two quartern loaves 
of bread, and about an ounce of salt and other condiments. If he 
cannot get meat, he must supply its place with at least two extra 
quartern loaves, or about a stone and a half of potatoes, or between 
five and six pounds of oatmeal, unless lie is, indeed, so fortunate as 
to be able to get skim milk, of which five pints a week will replace 
the meat. 

A person reduced to bare existence diet can undertake no habitual 
toil, mental or bodily, under the penalty of breaking down. 

" Bare existence " diet is that which requires to be estimated for 
administration to certain classes of the community who have a claim 
on their fellow-countrymen that their lives and health shall be pre- 
served in statu quo, but nothing further. Such are prisoners, pau- 
pers, or the members of a temporarily famine-stricken community. 

It would be obviously unjust to apply the same scale of quantity 
and quality to all persons under varying circumstances of constitu- 
tion and outward surroundings ; and to attempt to feed in the same 
way all these people for short or long periods, idle or employed, 
with light work or hard work, in hot or in cold weather, excited by 
hope or depressed by failure, involves an error of either excess or 
defect, or both at once. The dietaries recommended by the Home 
Office for prisoners very properly take all these circumstances into 
consideration. They allot "bare existence " diet only to those sen- 
tenced for short terms without labor. And they recognize the fact 
that a man's health is not injured (perhaps sometimes it is improved) 



364 DIET IN HEALTH AND DISEASE. 

by a few days of such abstinence as would in the long-run be dele- 
terious to him. Under a sentence of seven days, a prisoner gets 
daily one pound of bread and a quart of gruel containing four ounces 
of oatmeal. For more than seven and under twenty-one days, he 
has an extra half pound of bread. For longer terms it is advised to 
add potatoes and meat. 

The nutritive value of the first-named diet is thus calculated by 
Dr. Pavy ("Treatise on Food," page 415) : 

Nitrogenous matter 1.800 ounce. 

Fat 480 " 

Carbohydrates 10.712 " 

Of the second : 

Nitrogenous matter 2.448 ounces. 

Fat 608 " 

Carbohydrates 14.792 " 

In the convict establishments prisoners are all under long sen- 
tences, and are classified for dietetic purposes according to their 
occupation. 

The sparest of all is called " punishment diet," and is administered 
for offenses against the internal discipline of the prison. It is equiv- 
alent to corporeal chastisement, being designed to make the stomach 
a source of direct pain. It is limited to a period of three days, and 
fully answers its purposed end as a deterrent by causing the solar 
plexus to experience the greatest amount of distress it is capable of ; 
for after the expiration of that period sensation becomes blunted. 
It consists of one pound of bread and as much water as the prisoner 
chooses to drink. This last-named concession is not an unimportant 
one ; for it has been already remarked that a supply of fluid enables 
starvation, and by implication abstinence, to be longer borne. At 
the same time, it probably postpones the anesthesia, and therefore 
makes the intended suffering more real. "Punishment diet" con- 
tains, in 'Dr. Pavy's estimate : 

Nitrogenous matter 1.296 ounce. 

Carbohydrates 8.160 " 

Fat 0.256 " 

Mineral matter 0.368 " 



Total of dry solids 10.080 



GOVERNMENT DIETARIES. 365 

This is about half of what an average man requires to sustain him- 
self without work, and under its discipline he would probably lose 
three or four ounces of his weight daily till his bodily substance was 
reduced by six-tenths, at which period, according to Ohossat's exper- 
iments, he would die. 

" Penal diet " is that which is apportioned for more protracted 
punishment. It may be continued for three months. It consists of 
20 ounces of bread, 8 ounces of oatmeal, 20 ounces of milk, and 16 
ounces of potatoes daily. Its chemical constituents are as follows : 

Nitrogenous matter 8.TS4 ounces. 

Carbohydrates 19.864 " 

Fat 1-580 

Mineral matter 0.972 

Total of dry solids , 2C.200 " 



Upon this diet a fair amount of work may be done. The 
combustion of the carbohydrates evolves sufficient force to raise a 
ton 4,193 feet; and thus the effete muscular substance may be worn 
off by destructive assimilation, making place for new muscle derived 
from the nitrogenous matter, of which a bare sufficiency, but yet 
probably a sufficiency, is supplied. A man of strong constitution is 
usually found at the end of it to be in good health and of normal 
weight ; yet he has never probably experienced the content which 
arises from a luxus consumption of food. It is intended to deny him 
the normal pleasure of the accumulation of reserve force in the gas- 
tric region. This pleasurable sensation under ordinary circumstances 
much promotes digestion, so that the whole of the ingesta are made 
the best use of; and therefore in " penal diet," as above quoted, it 
has been found expedient to introduce the slight excess to be no- 
ticed above what is needful to accomplish the required work in 
"foot-tons" (see before). The penalty of the regimen involves a 
certain degree of waste. 

A close imitation of " penal diet " is that which the duty of a 
responsible government demands should be served out during a tem- 
porary famine, that is, one calculated not to last above three months. 
It is more economical to introduce the elements of variety in the 
diet than to be too monotonous that is, to save in the daily issue 
and to be occasionally liberal, to feast from time to time as a break 



366 DIET IN HEALTH AND DISEASE. 

in the regular fast. The expense of the excess is more than replaced 
by the diminished habitual ration, and that powerful preservative of 
life, anticipation of pleasure, is brought into play. A reduction of 
the allowance below what experience has indicated as " bare exist- 
ence diet," made during the famine in Madras in the beginning of 
1877, was attended with disastrous results. 

By dint of mixing and varying his diet, and making it consist 
of very nutritious articles, such as bread, meat, yolk of eggs, and 
soup, Signor Oornaro succeeded in reducing the quantity he daily 
consumed to as little as 12 ounces (Venetian). But then he made 
the solids go much farther by the addition of 14 ounces of good 
wine. And the probability is that this gentleman had a peculiar 
constitution, for, in spite of his many readers, he has had no imi- 
tators of the experiment on their own persons. 

2. The appropriate food of the second class may be fairly repre- 
sented by the dietaries of European soldiers in time of peace. The 
English soldier on home service, according to Dr. Parkes, receives 
from Government 5 J pounds of meat and 7 pounds of bread weekly, 
and buys additional bread, vegetables, milk, and groceries out of his 
pay. Such a diet is sufficient for anybody under ordinary circum- 
stances of regular light occupation ; but should extra demands be 
made upon mind or body, weight is lost, and, if the demands continue 
to be made, the health will suffer. Mr. F. Buckland, surgeon in 
the Guards, remarks (Society of Arts Journal, 1863, quoted by Dr. 
Playfair) that, though the sergeants in the Guards fatten upon their 
rations, the quantity is not enough for recruits during their drill. 

The Prussian soldier during peace gets weekly from his canteen 
11 pounds 1 ounce of rye bread and not quite 2 pounds of meat. 
This is obviously insufficient, but under the conscription system it is 
reckoned that he will be a.ble to make up the deficiency out of his 
own private means, or obtain charitable contributions from his 
friends. Dr. Hildesheim (" Die Normal-Diat," Berlin, 1856, page 60) 
states that asthenic diseases are very common in the army, which 
leads to the inference that the chance assistance on which the author- 
ities lean is not trustworthy. As the legal ration in these two ser- 
vices does not profess to be a man's full food, it is needless to analyze 
it. In the French infantry of the line, each man during peace gets 
weekly 15 pounds of bread, 3 T 8 o- pounds of meat, 2|- pounds of haricot 
beans or other vegetables, with salt and pepper, and If ounce of 



ECONOMICAL DIETARIES. 367 

brandy. This seems to be enough to support a man under light 
employment. Its analysis gives : 

Water 179.83 ounces. 

Nitrogenous matter (or albuminates) 30. 17 " 

Fat 9.29 " 

Carbohydrates (or starch) 12684 " 

Total of dry solids 166.30 " 

An Austrian under the same circumstances receives 13.9 pounds 
of bread, pound of flour, and 3.3 pounds of meat. The alimentary 
contents are : 



Water , 129.50 ounces. 

Nitrogenous matter 27.40 " 

Fat 8.23 M 

Carbohydrates 119.45 * 

Total of dry solids 155.08 ** 

The Eussian conscript is allowed weekly : l 

Black bread 7 pounds. 

Meat 7 pounds. 

Kawass (beer)..'. 7.7 quarts. 

Sour cabbage 24$ gills 122$ ounces. 

Barle 7 24$ gills 122$ ounces. 

Salts 10$ ounces. 

Horse-radish 28 grains. 

P e PP er 28 grains. 

Vinegar 5Jgills-26$ ounces. 

The " moderate exercise " of brain and muscle combined in the 
above classes is fairly represented in the convict scale by "light 
labor " (such as oakum picking) and by " industrial employment " 
(such as tailoring, cobbling, Roman mosaic and mat making, basket 
weaving, etc.). The dietary for prisoners thus engaged is nearly 
identical, except that the artisans using their brains are supplied 
with about an ounce extra daily. 

The " industrial employment diet " for a week is thus analyzed 
by Dr. Pavy:

This is probably a fair model for the most economical dietary on 
which an artisan or laborer on light work can thrive. It may be 
observed that the principle of variety is very conspicuous, and in 
private life it is possible to introduce still more variety by cook- 
ery. In the English and Prussian armies the introduction of va- 
riety is left to be attained by forcing the soldier to purchase some 
portion of his food out of his own pocket ; in the French scale it 
is managed by issuing spices and various vegetables, and trusting 
to the innate genius of the Gaulish warrior for cooking. The issue 
of an occasional glass of brandy on holidays makes an agreeable 
change and benefits digestion; but if wine could be obtained it would 
be better and not extravagant. The Austrian bill of fare is sadly 
monotonous. The Russian ration may be noticed as particularly 
liberal of accessory and antiscorbutic food, from which civil as well 
as military dieticians might take a useful hint. Vinegar and other 
vegetable acids are too much neglected by our handicraftsmen and 
soldiers. The Carthaginians are stated by Aristotle to have used 
vinegar as a substitute for wine during their campaigns ; and the 
recipes given by Cato for flavoring vinegar with fruits show that it 
was in use among tke laboring population in Italy. 

3. "Active" laborers are those who get through such an amount 
of work daily, exclusive of Sundays, as may be represented by a walk

of twenty miles. In this class are soldiers during a campaign, letter- 
carriers, and engineers employed on field-work or as artisans. These 
habitually consume on the average about a fifth more nitrogenous 
food and twice as much fat as the last class, while the quantity of 
vegetable hydrocarbons is not augmented, except in the Koyal Engi- 
neers. 

The " hard-labor diet " of convict prisons fairly represents what 
the authorities consider the minimum. It is the same as that already 
described as "industrial-employment diet," with the following addi- 
tions: barley, one ounce; bread, twenty ounces; shins for soup, 
eight ounces; carrots, one ounce; onions, one-half ounce; turnips, 
one ounce. It contains, however, fourteen ounces less milk and one 
ounce less " meat." 

The nutritive value of the additions may be seen by Dr. Pavy's 
alimentary analysis, which is as follows :

370 DIET IN HEALTH AND DISEASE. 

work is diminished at the latter season by If- hours, which is equiva- 
lent to an augmentation of the diet. The additions are more judi- 
cious than those made by the classes above mentioned, who partly 
furnish their own food ; for bread and vegetables constitute a large 
portion of the convict ration, and the extra quantity of soup replaces 
the lost milk, without risk of the waste in cooking, common when 
the uneducated deal with solid meat. 

4. " Hard work " is that got through by English navvies, hard- 
worked weavers, and blacksmiths, etc., which is more earnest and in- 
tense than the enforced " hard labor " of the convict. It is difficult 
to obtain accurate information, but it would appear from Dr. Play- 
fair's estimates that the customary addition to the diet is entirely in 
nitrogenous constituents. The higher their wages, the more meat the 
men eat. 

The neglect of vegetables by the last two classes is, in a physio- 
logical point of view, imprudent, and possibly may be a contributing 
cause of an inordinate thirst for alcohol which impoverishes and de- 
grades many among them. To satisfy their instinctive craving for a 
hydrocarbon, they take one convenient, indeed, in some respects, 
but of which any excess is unwholesome. The discovery already 
mentioned of the production of force from the assimilation of starch 
leads to a knowledge, opposed to old prejudices but supported by ex- 
perience, that the raising of the energies to their full height of use- 
fulness may be effected by vegetable food quite as well as by the 
more stimulating and more expensive animal nutriment, or by the 
more rapidly absorbed alcohol. 

With regard to the tables quoted above, in which ultimate analy- 
ses are used as data for dietetic rules, it must be noticed that their 
authors deprecate arguments being founded on any but the very 
broadest characters of the articles analyzed. Specimens, even when 
of the highest quality, differ strangely from one another. Season, soil, 
modes of culture, the variations of species, and many other little- 
known influences, come into play and prevent our taking the market 
names of eatables as representatives of a definite chemical constitu- 
tion. And it may be added that ample scope should be allowed for 
the peculiarities of the individual and of his life-history. In the ap- 
plication of general rules, some one must be trusted to relax or strain 
them when circumstances require, or failures of a fatal character may 
occasionally result, and more often a galling perversion of justice. 



CARE IN REDUCING THE DIET. 371 

Estimates for the thrifty management of food-supply have usually 
reference to the feeding of others rather than to the calculation of 
a man's own dietary. Enough has been said on that point under the 
head of the influence of diet upon health; and if a person really 
wants to bring down the expense of feeding himself to the lowest 
point, he can readily rate himself under one of the classes enumer- 
ated above, and act accordingly. It may, however, be doubted 
whether it is wise to reduce the diet to the minimum which the work 
requires. The certain evils of an accidental deficiency, or of a mis- 
calculation, are so serious that the danger outweighs the possible in- 
convenience of a slight excess. It were an unthrifty thrift, indeed, 
which imperiled vigor of mind and body to effect a pecuniary sav- 
ing ; for there is no investment so remunerative as high health. A 
man need not consider that he is wasteful when he spends money 
upon making his bill of fare palatable and provocative of indulgence 
to the extent of moderate superfluity. Pleasure and prudence here 
walk hand in hand.

LESSONS IN COOKERY: 



Hand-book of the National Training-School for Cookery, South 
Kensington, London. To which is added the Principles of 
Diet in Health and Disease, by Thomas K, Chambers, M. D. 
Edited by Eliza A. Youmans. In one vol., 12mo, 382 pages 
bound in cloth. Price, $1.50. 



THIS is an important work for such American housekeepers as are interested 
in the principles of good cookery ; but it differs so much from ordinary cook- 
books that, to prevent misunderstanding, it is needful to call attention to its 
special features. Emanating from a school, and that school a_ working kitchen, 
the manual is beyond comparison the most thoroughly practical cook-book for 
general use that has ever been made. 

The novelty and merit of the work are in the method by which it secures 
successful practice. Its lessons, the plainest, easiest, and fullest, anywhere to be 
found, have grown out of a long and painstaking experience in finding out the 
best plan of teaching beginners and ignorant persons how to cook well. They 
were perfected through the stupidities, blunders, mistakes, questionings, and 
difficulties, of hundreds of pupils, of all ages, grades, and capacities, under the 
careful direction of intelligent, practical teachers. 

A cook-book's highest test is, Does it actually teach the art of cookery, or will 
it make good practical cooks ? Thus judged, this volume is without a rival. It 
is not a mere compilation, nor the work of any one person. The managers of 
the training-school found that there was no cook-book suitable for their pur- 
poses, and that they must make one. The proof of its success is that, by follow- 
ing its simple directions, many hundred women have become qualified to fill 
responsible situations as cooks, or to instruct their daughters or servants in 
cookery, or to go out and establish other cooking-schools themselves. 

Ordinary cook-books boast of the rarity, novelty, or great extent, of their re- 
ceipts. The "Lessons in Cookery" makes no claim of this kind. Those who 
look in it for the last touches in oysters, terrapin, cake, or ice-cream, will be 
disappointed. There are thousands of English receipts that will not be found in 
it, and, of course, it does not treat of the dishes that are special to this country. 
The receipts of the work are lessons in practice, and these occupy so much space 
that a great multitude could not be furnished. 

The volume, however, covers sufficient ground for a liberal and varied diet. 
It contains upward of 200 lessons in the preparation of a wide ran<re of dishes- 
soups, fish, meats, poultry, game, vegetables, entrees, souffles, puddings, jellies, 
creams, rolls, biscuit, bread, and a variety of suitable dishes for the sick. The 
wants of well-to-do families as well as those of more moderate means are thus 
amply provided for. 

The chief advantage of the book consists in its efficient method of improving 
the quality of common cookery. In this respect it is strong where other books 
are defective. It will be useful in cooking-schools, cooking-classes, and cock- 
ing-clubs ; but it will be still more useful in private kitchens. Many American 
women know how to cook well, but they are not so successful in teaching what 
they know to others. By the aid of these simple le?sons they may turn their 
kitchens into little domestic cooking-schools, and thus elevate an important 
branch of household economy, now too much neglected.

PEEFACE TO THE AMERICAN EDITION. 



The present work on cookery appeared in England under the 
title of " The Official Hand-Book of the National Training School for 
Cookery," and it contains the lessons on the preparation of food 
which were practised in that institution. It has been reprinted 
in this country with some slight revision, for the use of American 
families, because of its superior merits as a cook-book to be con- 
sulted in the ordinary way, and also because it is the plainest, sim- 
plest, and most perfect guide to self-education in the Jcitchen that 
has yet appeared. In this respect it represents a very marked 
advance in an important domestic art hitherto much neglected. 

A glance at its contents will show the ground it covers, and how 
fully it meets the general wants. The dishes for which it provides 
have been selected with an unusual degree of care and judgment. 
They have been chosen to meet the needs of well-to-do families, and 
also those of more moderate means, who must observe a strict econ- 
omy. Provision is made for an ample and varied diet, and for meals 
of a simple and frugal character. Receipts are given for an excellent 
variety of soups, for cooking many kinds of fish in different ways, for 
the preparation of meats, poultry, game, and vegetables, and for a 
choice selection of entries, souffles, puddings, jellies, and creams. 
Besides the courses of a well-ordered dinner, there are directions 
for making rolls, biscuits, bread, and numerous dishes for breakfast 
and tea, together with a most valuable set of directions how to pre- 
pare food for the sick. The aim has been to meet the wants of the 
great mass of people who are not rich enough to abandon their 
kitchen to the management of professional cooks, and who must keep 
a careful eye to expense. But while the costly refinements of artis- 

418541 



iv PREFACE TO THE AMERICAN EDITION. 

tic and decorative cookery are avoided, there has heen a constant ref- 
erence to the simple requirements of good taste in the preparation 
of food for the table. 

But the especial merit of this volume, and the cliaracter by which 
it stands alone among cook-books, is the superior method it offers 
of teaching the art of practical cookery. It is at this vital point 
that all our current cook-books break down ; they make no provi- 
sion for getting a knowledge of this subject in any systematic way. 
So much in them is vague, so much taken for granted, and so much 
is loose, careless, and misleading in their receipts, that they are 
good for nothing to teach beginners, good for nothing as guides to 
successful practice, and only of use to those who already know 
enough to supply their deficiencies and protect themselves against 
their errors. In fact, the hand-book required to teach cookery 
effectually cannot be made by any single person in the usual man- 
ner, but it must be itself a product of such teaching. 

The present volume originated in this way, and embodies a 
tried and successful method of making good practical cooks. The 
lessons given in the following pages came from a training kitchen 
for pupils of all grades, and the directions of its receipts are so mi- 
nute, explicit, distinct, and complete, that they may be followed 
with ease by every person of common-sense who has the slightest 
desire to learn. They are the results of long and careful practice in 
teaching beginners how to cook, and have grown out of exercises 
often repeated with a view of making them as perfect as possible. 
It is commonly regarded as a good thing in a cook-book that its 
compiler has tested some of its receipts and points out the troubles 
and failures likely to occur in early trials. But the completeness 
of the instructions in this work was attained through the stupidities, 
blunders, mistakes, questionings, and difficulties of hundreds of learn- 
ers of all capacities, doing the work over and over again under the 
critical direction of intelligent, practical teachers, who were bent 
upon finding out the best method of doing each thing, and the best 
method of teaching others how to do it. Not a single item neces- 
sary to perfect the required process is omitted. The steps are sep- 
arated, and given in numerical order, so as to enforce attention to 
one thing at a time, and the right thing at the right time, while the 
precautions against mistakes are so careful that even the dullest can 
hardly go wrong. Each receipt in the volume is not only the formula 



PREFACE TO THE AMERICAN EDITION. y 

for a dish, but it is also a lesson in a practical process, so that in the 
preparation of every article of food something is gained toward 
greater proficiency in the art of cooking well. 

A few words in regard to the origin of the school in which it was 
produced will still further illustrate the character of this work. A 
vigorous movement has been made in England to elevate this branch 
of domestic economy by establishing schools for training pupils in 
the art of cookery. These schools have grown immediately out of 
the need of greater general economy among the working classes, as 
it was seen that the high prices of provisions were seriously aggra- 
vated by not knowing how to make the most of them in their kitch- 
en preparation. The attention of the managers of the South Ken- 
sington Museum of Arts in West London was several years ago 
drawn to the subject ; and feeling that something required to be done, 
they established pubhc lectures on the preparation of food with plat- 
form demonstrations of various culinary operations. But it was 
quickly found that mere exposition and illustration, though not 
without use, were wholly inadequate to the object in view ; because 
a cooking school, .to be thorough, must provide for practice. Lectur- 
ing, and explaining to pupils, and barely showing them how things 
are done, is sure to fail because cookery, like music, can only be 
learned by actually doing it. As well undertake to teach the piano 
by talking and exhibiting its capabilities as to teach a person how to 
make a dish properly by only listening and looking on. Provision 
had therefore to be made for forming classes to do themselves what 
they at first only saw others do. 

But this task was by no means an easy one. There were no pre- 
existing plans to follow ; qualified teachers and suitable text-books 
were wanting ; it was an expensive form of education ; the public 
thought it a doubtful innovation; and educational authorities dis- 
couraged it. But the parties interested decided that the time had 
come for a systematic and persistent effort. They felt their way 
cautiously, and in 1874 organized classes for graded courses of prac- 
tice. The object was to give women the best possible instruction in 
practical cookery, and for this purpose the school was open to all. 
But to make its work most largely useful, it was constituted as a

.already a large number of cooking schools in England connected with 
the National or Common School system. 

As no cook-book to be found was worth anything to aid the 
practical instruction proposed, the teachers had to take this matter 
in hand at the outset. They began by drawing up a careful set of 
directions to be followed by the learners in doing their work. For 
each lesson in all the grades each pupil was furnished with a printed 
sheet of these directions, stating tlie ingredients of each dish to be 
prepared, the quantities and separate cost of these ingredients, what 
was to be done first, what next, and so on through the whole series 
of operations, nothing being assumed as known, and all the minute 
steps being indicated in the order that was found best. These guides 
were necessarily imperfect at first, and were subject to constant re- 
vision and extension as experience suggested corrections; in fact, 
they embodied the progress of the school in the successful attainment 
of its object. At each new printing the improvements that had been 
made were incorporated, and only after years of trial were these 
guides to practice at length combined and issued in a book-form. 
The lessons or receipts of this volume were all slowly elaborated in 
this painstaking manner, and the mode of working proved perfectly 
successful with the pupils. It was easy and pleasant, yet careful and 
thorough, and secured a rapid and gratifying proficiency.^ 

In saying that the South Kensington Cooking School has been 
successful, I speak from direct knowledge of it. I was a pupil there 
for several weeks, and carefully observed its operations. The classes 
showed the most extraordinary mental and social diversity. There 
were cultivated ladies, the daughters of country gentlemen, old house- 
keepers, servants, cooks, and colored girls from South Africa, togeth- 
er with a large proportion of intelligent young women who were 
preparing to become teachers. They worked together with a har- 
mony and good feeling that, I confess, somewhat surprised me, but 



^ The honor of contributing- chiefly toward the establishment of this school and super- 
intending its development is due to Sir Henry Cole, the able director and master mind of 
the South Kensington Museum. By his firm purpose and excellent judgment a novel 
experiment, surrounded by many difficulties, became a recognized success and a great 
national benefit. The "Lessons" were gradually brought into shape by the teachers, 
under the supervision of the accomplished daughter of Sir Henry Cole, whose initials 
(R. O. C.) were appended to them as revised for us© in the school, and are also sub- 
scribed to the EngUsh Prefiice of this work.

they were all closely occupied and thoroughly interested inllVoMtJljg «Lr 
object. There were teachers to provide materials, to plan the daily *^ 
work, to direct operations, and to be consulted when necessary; but 
the admirable method adopted left each learner to go through her 
task with but a small amount of assistance. Indeed, the complete- 
ness of the directions in hand seemed to assure the success of every 
pupil from the start. There was, of course, a difference in dexterity, 
and in facility of work previously acquired ; but raw beginners went 
on so well that they were astonished at what they found themselves 
able to do. 

American ladies when looking over these lessons are apt to smile 
at their extreme simplicity and triviality, but it must be remembered 
that the difference between good and bad cookery is very much a 
matter of attention to trifles. Slight mistakes, small omissions, 
little things done at the wrong time, spoil dishes. The excellence 
of these lessons consists in their faithfulness in regard to minutiaa, 
and the habits they enforce of attention to trifling particulars. They 
make no claim to literary merit. The receipts are homely, direct, and 
meant only to be easily and distinctly understood. They are full of 
repetitions, because processes are constantly repeated, and it was 
necessary that the directions in each receipt should be full and 
complete. They are not enticing reading, because they were made 
to work by. The book, in fact, belongs in the kitchen where cook- 
ery is done ; and it is now republished because its success there has 
been demonstrated. Many hundred persons totally ignorant of the 
subject have become eflficient and capable cooks by pursuing the 
mode of practice here adopted — by going through these lessons — 
and the same results can be obtained by pursuing the same method 
anywhere. American housekeepers who have any real interest in 
home improvement, and are willing to take a little pains to instruct 
their daughters or their servants in the art of cooking well, will 
find the volume an adequate and invaluable help toward the attain- 
ment of this object. It will prove a useful text-book in the cooking 
schools and young ladies' cooking clubs that are springing up in this 
country, and classes could be advantageously formed, by its help, 
for kitchen practice in every female seminary. 

In revising these lessons but very slight changes have been made, 
and those only of form. The prices of articles, an important feat- 
ure in the original work, and essential in the cooking school, have

been omitted, as they do not apply in this country ; and American 
prices have not been substituted because they vary so much in differ- 
ent localities. As the lessons were furnished on separate sheets for 
daily use in the school, they all took the form of the following ex- 
ample, and have been modified in the manner shown by referring 
to the same lesson on page 180 of the present volume :

Now we will show you how to make Mayonnaise Sauce. 

1. We take two eggs and put the yolks in one basin and the whites (which 
will not be wanted) into another basin. 

2. We take a wooden spoon and just stir the yolks enough to break them. 

3. We add to them a salispoonful of salt and half a saltspoonful of pepper 
and a tahlespoonful of French vinegar. 

4. We take a bottle of salad oil, and, putting our thumb half over the 
top, pour in, drop by drop, the oil, stirring well with a whisk the whole time ; 
a gill of oil will be sufficient. 

ST. B.— We might add a teaspoonful of ready-mademustard or tarragon vinegar 
if liked, stirring it in smoothly. 

5. The sawce is now ready for use. 

Now it is finished. 



It has been suggested that the volume ought to be Americanized 
by omitting some of the English receipts that are but little used in 
this country, and substituting others for special American dishes. 



PREFACE TO THE AMERICAN EDITION. Jx 

But this suggestion involves a total misconception of the character of 
the work, which is valuable solely on account of the qualities it de- 
rives from the experience of the Training School. As American 
dishes are not used in England, there were of course no " lessons " 
in their preparation. Common receipts would be out of place in the 
following pages, and receipts for American dishes could not be prop- 
erly introduced until they had been assimilated to the plan and pecul- 
iarities of the work. There are many hundred good English receipts 
that will be sought in vain in the volume; and those who refer to it 
to find the last new things in American cookery will of course be 
disappointed. It is not a receipt-book, but a book to show how to 
use and improve receipts ; or, as stated in the English preface, it is 
not a dictionary of reference, but rather a grammar of processes. Its 
merit is that it offers an improved mode of kitchen practice ; and, as 
the principles and conditions of good cookery are everywhere the 
same, all that is characteristic of the volume is just as applicable and 
valuable in this country as in England. 

As the subject of cookery is in close relations with that of diet, I 
have aimed to increase the usefulness of the present work by appending 
a valuable essay upon " Diet in Health and Disease," the latest that 
has appeared, and by an eminent living authority on dietetical ques- 
tions. Dr. Chambers is the author of various able works on the uses 
and effects of food, and in this article, which he recently contributed 
to the new edition of the " Encyclopaedia Britannica," he has summed 
up in an admirable manner the leading facts and principles of modem 
dietetical science. Hints derived from this essay will often be found 
of much service in directing housekeepers as to what it is best to 
cook, and in the composition of meals in various circumstances, 
with reference to occupation, enjoyment, and health.

PREFACE TO THE ENGLISH EDITION. 



I. This work has been written to explain in an easy way the first 
principles of good Cookery, and in the form of lessons is especially 
addressed to those who wish to carry them into practice. It has 
been the aim of the writer to leave no detail, however small, vaguely 
stated. It is taken for granted that the learner has no knowledge on 
the subject. The loose expressions, such as " a pinch," " a little," 
found in all cookery books, are therefore avoided, and precise quanti- 
ties are given. 

II. The work is not to be regarded as an exhaustive cookery book 
with numerous recipes. It aims to be rather a grammar than a dic- 
tionary. 

III. The lessons give a sufficient number of examples of cookery 
illustrating many degrees of cost : thus the rich may have a dish of 
curried rabbit for 3s. 8d,^ and the poor may have a dish of curried 
tripe for lO^d. 

IV. The work has been used and tested in the National Training 
School for Cookery since 1875, and the instructors now employed in 
local schools throughout the country have been taught and practised 
by means of these lessons. 

y. It has been found that it is most convenient to practise the 
lesson with the instructions in sight close at hand. An edition of 
each lesson has been printed on separate sheets of thick paper, for 
the use of students and teachers, which may be obtained at the N'a- 
tional Training School for Cookery, or at any of the local schools. 

VI. The writer requests that the notice of any errors and omis- 
sions which are inevitable in a work of this kind may be communi- 
cated to R. O. C, at the National Training School for Cookery, Ex- 
hibition Road, London, S. W.

CHAPTER I. 

INTRODUCTORY. 

OJ^ CLEAJ^IJ^G RANGES, STOVES, AJfD KITCHEM 
UTEJTSILS. 



LESSON FIEST. 
TO CLEAN A KITCHEN RANGE OR STOVE. 

1. Dump the grate, and, with the poker, carefully re- 
move the clinkers that adhere to the fire-brick. 

2. Shovel into a scuttle the ashes, clinkers, and cinders 
or partially-burned coal. 

N. B. — These should be sifted. Throw away the ashes and elinkevs, but 
save the cinders, to use in kindling fires. 

3. Take a brush or wing, and sweep down all the soot 
from the flues and oven. 

N. B. — This should be done every day, when bituminous coal is burned ; 
but if anthracite coal is used, the flues will not need cleaning oftener 
than once in two weeks. ^ Wood-stoves should be cleaned as often as 
once a week, 

* Directions for keeping ranges and stoves in order are usually furnished 
by the dealer ; and as they vary with the construction, they may be appealed 
to for more specific instructions. 



2 LESSONS IN COOKERY. 

4. Mix some stove-polish in an earthen dish, with 
enough water to make it into a smooth liquid. 

5. Dip the blacking-brush in the mixture, and cover 
with it the whole of the range, working from the top 
downward. 

6. When the blacking is dry, rub it all over with a dry 
brush. 

7. Then take another brush and polish the range all 
over, so as to make it quite bright. 

8. ]^ow sweep the soot and dust from the stove and the 
hearth. 

9. Steel handles and bolts may be polished by rubbing 
with emery-paper, but brass handles and bolts should be 
polished with both brick-dust and a leather. . 

10. To clean the slate or limestone hearth in front of the 
range, get a flannel and a pail of hot water; put in it 
some soda, and wash the hearth all over. 

11. Then wring the flannel out in hot water and smooth 
the hearth over, rubbing lightly all in one direction. 

12. Black-lead and polish the inside of the fender in the 
same way as you did the range, and brighten the rim of it 
with emery-paper. 

TO KINDLE A FIRE. 

1. Place a few sifted cinders at the bottom of the 
grate. 

2. Then put in some crumpled paper and arrange sticks 
over it, laying them across each other. For kindling an- 
thracite coal, hard wood should be added. Charcoal is 
sometimes used in place of wood, and is better, when it 
can be afforded. 

3. Place a few cinders above the wood, and light the 
paper at the bottom. 



CLEANING KITCHEN UTENSILS. 3 

4. When the wood is well on fire, put on a small quan- 
tity of coal, and wait till it is thoroughly heated and be- 
ginning to burn before more is added. 



LESSON SECOND. 
TO CLEAN A GAS-STOVE. 

1. Lift out the rest at the top. 

2. Wash the top of the stove and the rest with a flan- 
nel dipped in hot water and soda, so as to remove all grease 
and dirt ; then wring out the flannel, and partially dry the 
top of the stove. 

3. ]S^ow cover with stove-blacking, and polish in the 
same way as the kitchen range. 

N. B. — ^Be careful not to stop up the gas-holes with the stoye-polish. 

4. Sweep away the soot and dust, and put the rest back 
over the stove. 



LESSON THIRD 
TO CLEAN AN IRON SAUCEPAN. 

1. Wash the saucepan well in hot water and soda. 

N. B. ^AU the black should be removed from the outside and bottom. 

2. Soap the palm of one hand, or a brush, and rub the 
inside of the saucepan. 

N.B. — ^In washing any greasy utensil, it is best, if possible, to use the 
hand instead of a flannel, as the latter retains the grease, and so 
keeps putting the grease on again, instead of rubbing it off. 

3. Mix some sand and powdered soda together, and 
then dip the soaped hand or brush into it, and rub the in- 
side of the saucepan until it is quite clean and bright. 



LESSONS IN COOKERY. 

4. E'ow rinse it in water and dry it with a cloth. 

5. Clean the lid in the same way. 

N. B. — A white enameled stewpan is cleansed in the same way. Great 
care should be taken to remove all the stains off the white enamel 
inside. 

N. B. — Salt might be mixed with the sand, and used to remove the 
stains from the enamel. 



LESSON FOURTH. 
TO CLEAN A COPPER STEWPAN. 

1. Mix some sand and salt together on a plate — half the 
quantity of salt to that of sand. 

2. Wash the stewpan well in hot water and soda. 

3. Soap the hand, or a brush, dip it in the salt and sand, 
and rub the inside of the pan until all stains are removed 
and it has become clean and bright. 

4. Hinse it out well in the water, dry the inside quickly, 
and then turn over the pan and clean the copper outside. 

5. Eub it in the same way with a soaped hand, or a 
brush dipped in sand and salt. 

N. B. — If there are many stains on it, an old half lemon, or vinegar, 

might be used to remove them. 
N. B. — Only the copper part should be cleaned with lemon or vinegar. 

6. Now rinse it again thoroughly, and dry it quickly 
with a cloth. 



CHAPTER II. 
EOASTIKG, BOILING, BAKIJ^G, FBYIJ^G. 



LESSON FIRST. 
ROASTING. 

To Eoast Meat at an open range : 

1. Take your joint — say a leg of mutton. 

2. See that it is quite clean, and, if necessary, scrape it 
with a knife, and wipe it over with a clean cloth. 

N. B. — As a rule, meat should not be washed in water, as it takes 
some of the goodness out. If meat has been kept some time, and 
is not quite fresh, then you might wash it with a little vinegar and 
water, but it must be well wiped afterward. 

3. With a sharp knife cut off the hnucJde-hone from 
the leg of mutton, 

N. B. — ^Put aside the knuckle-bone. It can be used with beef for 
beef -tea, or be put in the stock-pot ; or the trimmings and one pint 
of water will make gravy for your joint when done, allowing it to 
boil while the joint is roasting. 

4. Trim off the piece of flarik^ and remove the thick 
piece of skin from the part where the leg joins the loin. 



6 LESSONS IN COOKERY. 

(These trimmings must be put aside, as they can be used 
for other purposes.) 

6. E"ow weigh the leg of mutton, so as to find out how 
long it will take to roast it, as a quarter of an hour is 
allowed for each pound-weight, and one quarter of an hour 
besides. 

N. B. — ^When you have a joint without bone, such as rolled ribs of beef 
or topside of beef allow twenty minutes to each pound, as it is all 
solid meat. 

6. Take the leg of mutton, which weighs say seven 
pounds, and will therefore require two hours to roast. 

7. Put the tin oven ^ in front of the fire. 

8. See that the dripping-pan is in the oven with the 
dripping-ladle. 

9. Take the hook of the oven, or of the roasting-jack, 
if you have one, and pass it through the Jcnuckle-end of 
the leg. 

10. Wind up the jack with the key before you put the 
joint on, so as to make it twist the meat round. 

11. Put the joint close to the fire for the Jlrst Jive 
minutes. 

12. After that time, draw it a little back, or it will cook 
too quickly, and become burnt and driedv 

N. B. — Meat that is frozen must be placed some way from the fire at 
first, and then drawn gradually toward it, as it must thaw slowly, or 
it may become tough. 

' In this country, tin ovens placed before the fire take the place of the 
English screen and roasting-jack. These ovens are made in various ways, 
but they all have a door at the back for basting, a hook in the centre from 
which the meat is suspended, and a dripping-pan in the bottom. A French 
roasting-jack may take the place of the simple hook, and with this you may 
proceed with the roasting according to the directions given above. There 
are stoves and ranges so made that tin ovens for roasting can be securely 
fastened to the front, and taken away when not in use. 



ROASTING AND BOILING. 7 

13. Baste the joint every five minutes with the drip- 
pings that run from it into the pan, using the dripping- 
ladle. 

14. Let it roast for two hours, as its weight is seven 
pounds. 

15. Just before you dish up the joint, you must sprinkle 
about a saltspoonful of salt over, and then baste it well. 

16. "Warm a large dish. 

17. Take the hook of the jack and place the joint on 
the hot dish, and draw out the hook. 

18. Pour about a gill of hot stock into the dish. (This 
makes the gravy, and when the joint is cut, the juices 
from the meat will add to it.) 

19. Cut a piece of demy-paper like a fringe, and put it 
round the end of the knuckle-bone. 

N. B. — The dripping in the pan should be poured into a basin, and 
when it is cold, there will be under the crust of dripping a good 
gravy. When the dripping is required for use, it must be carefully 
removed from the top of the gravy and clarified {see Lesson on 
" Frying "). Nearly all joints can be roasted in this way. Attention 
should be paid to the rules given above for joints of meat without 
bone. 



LESSON SECOND. 
BOILING. 

ToBo\\Meat: 

1. Give attention to the fi/re, and build it up gradu- 
ally with small pieces of coal, so as to make it burn clear 
and bright. 

2. You must not have a smoky fire for boiling, or the 
meat will get smoked. Start with a good fire, and keep 
it up by adding occasionally small coal, and so prevent 
smoke as much as possible. 

N. B. — You do not require such a clear, bright fire as for roasting. 
2 



8 LESSONS IN COOKERY. 

3. Take a saucepan sufficiently large to hold the joint 
to be cooked. 

4. Fill the saucepan almost full of cold water ^ and put 
it on the fire to warm. 

N. B. — Salt should always be added to the water in the saucepan to 
make the water taste, unless the meat to be cooked is already 
salted^ in which case it should be omitted. 

5. Now take the joint, say, for example, a piece of the 
silver-side of heef salted. 

6. See that it is quite clean, and, if necessary, scrape 
it with a knife, and wipe it over with a clean cloth. 

N. B. — Meat should not, as a rule, be washed in loaicr, as it takes some 
of the goodness out. 3feat that has been kept some time, and is 
not quite fresh, might be washed with vinegar and water^ but it 
must be well wiped afterward. 

N. B. — Salt meat must not be washed with vinegar and water, but only 
with salt and water. 

7. Now weigh the piece of salt heef, so as to find out 
how long it will take to boil, as ten 7ninutes .slyg allowed 
for each pound of meat. 

N. B. — This rule refers to the boiling of all meat except porTc, which 
requires fifteen minutes to each pound of meat. 

A. — ^In boiling fresh meat to be eaten, the joint should be first 
plunged into boiling water, in order that the albumen on the outside 
of the joint may become hardened, and so prevent the escape of the 
juices of the meat. 

B. — The temperature of the water should then be lowered gradually 
(by adding a small quantity of cold water and drawing the sauce- 
pan to the side of the fire), and the meat allowed to simmer gently, 
or it will become tough. 

c. — In boiling meat for the purpose of making soup, the meat should 
be put into cold water, in order to extract all the goodness from it. 

D. — The water should be brought gradually to boiling point, then 
moved to the side of the fire, and left to simmer gently for some 
length of time. 



BOILING. 9 

N". B. — Salt meat must be put into toarm wata\ so as to extract a little 
of the salt before the pores of the skin are closed up. If the meat 
were- put into boiling watei-, the pores of the skin would be closed, 
and the meat would be hardened by the salt not being allowed to 
escape. 

8. When the water in the saucepan is warm, take the 
heef, which weighs say eight pounds (it will therefore 
take about one hour and twenty minutes\ and put it in 
the saucepan. There should be only just enough water to 
cover the joint. 

9. Let the water just boil up, and then move the 
saucepan to the side of the fire, and let it simmer gently 
for the remainder of the time. 

10. As soon as the water comes to the boil, you must 
take a large spoon and shim it carefully. 

N. B. — The scum should be skimmed off directly it rises, or it will boil 
down again in the meat and spoil it. Scum is the impurity which 
rises from the meat. 

N. B. — Be very careful not to let the meat boil, or it will be hardened 
and tough. 

11. When the meat is sufficiently cooked, take it care- 
fully out of the saucepan, and put it on a hot dish for 
serving. Pour about a gill of the liquor (in which it was 
boiled) round the joint, (This makes the gravy ^ and 
when the jovnt is cut, the juices from the meat will add 
to it.) 

N. B. — The liquor from boiled meat can always be used for different 
purposes, and should therefore never be thrown away, but poured 
into a clean basin and put aside to cool. The fai should be carefully 
removed from the top of the liqxior while it is cold, before being 
used. Salt liquor is often used for making pea-soup.

LESSON THIRD. 
BAKING MEAT, BREAD, PASTRY, ETC. 

To Bake Meat : 

1. You must liave a good fire, aud keep it up, adding 
by degrees small pieces of coal, as the oven is required to 
be very hot. 

N. B. — ^If it is a close range with which you are dealing, you should 
pull out the damper placed over the oven, in order to draw all the 
heat of the fire toward the oven. The ventilator ^ of the oven 
should be closed. 

N. B. — In kitchen stoves there is usually either a handle at the top 
of the oven, to be pulled out for opening the ventilator, or a slide- 
ventilator at the bottom. 

2. Test the heat of the oven by the thermometer, 
which is fixed in the door of the oven. The heat should 
rise to 240° Fahr. 

3. See that the joint is clean, as directed in the Les- 
son on "Eoasting," Kote 2. Weigh it, to find out how 
long it will take to bake, as ten minutes are allowed foi 
each pound of weight. 

N. B. — When you have a joint without bone, you must allow about fif- 
teen minutes to each pound of weight, as it is solid meat. 

4. Take the hot-water tin on which the stand for the 
meat is placed, lift up the upper tin or tray, and fill the 

1 As a rule, American ranges and stoves are not supplied with a separate 
arrangement for ventilating the ovens. The heat is usually controlled by 
opening and closing the damper in front of the fire. Ability to manage a 
range or stove in this respect comes only with experience. But in all our 
generally-approved ranges and stoves a competent cook can obtain well- 
baked meat, such as is described in this lesson, by making the oven very hot 
at first, and after a little, partially or wholly closing the damper, to lessen 
combustion. 



BAKING MEAT. H 

under tin lialf full of warm water ; then fit on the upper 
tin. 

N. B. — In one corner of the upper tin is a small hole for the escape of 
steam. The water must only just reach this hole, and not come 
into it. 

N. B. — ^The water is placed in the tin to prevent the tin and the meat 
from getting burnt, and so causing a disagreeable smell. 

5. Place the stand on the hot-water tin, to raise the 
joint and prevent it from standing in its own dripj>ing, 
which would sodden and spoil the meat. 

6. 1^0 w take i\iQ joint, which weighs say seven pounds 
(it will, therefore, take one hour and ten minutes to hake), 
and put it on the stand. Dredge ^ur over it. 

7. Put the tdn, with the meat, in the oven. The oven 
should be kept very hot for the first ^v^ Tninutes, in order 
to form a brown crust on the outside of the joint, to keep 
in the juices of the meat ; after that time the ventilator 
of the oven should be opened, so as to allow the steam to 
escape, or the meat would get sodden ed. 

N. B. — Meat that is frozen must be gradually warmed to thaw it, be- 
fore shutting it up in the hot oven, or it will be tough. 

8. Baste the joint every fifteen minutes with the 
drippings that run from the meat into the pan, using the 
dripping-ladle. 

N. B. — Joints that are not very fat must be even more frequently 
basted, or they will burn. If there is not enough dripping from 
the meat, a little extra dripping should be put in the pan. 

N. B. — Joints that have no fat should be covered with a piece of 
whity-brown paper which has been spread with butter or dripping ; 
it will prevent the meat catching too quickly. 

9. Turn the joint over occasionally, as the upper side 
will brown quicker than the under. 



12 LESSONS IN COOKERY. 

N. B. — ^Potatoes, washed and peeled, or a small suet or dripping and 
flour pudding {see " Puddings," Lesson 28), or a Yorkshire pudding 
{see " Puddings," Lesson 29), might be baked under the meat ; but 
they should be put in only half an hour before the meat is finished. 

10. Just before you dish up the joint, sprinkle a salt- 
spoonful of salt over it, and then baste it well. 

11. Serve the joint on a hot dish (as described in the Les- 
son on '' Koasting," Note 18), and act with regard to the 
dripping according to N. B. after Note 19. 

N. B. — Pastry or bread, etc., should not be baked in the oven at the 
same time as the meat, for the steam would prevent their baking 
properly. For baking small patties or tartlets made of puff-paste, 
the heat of the oven should rise to 300° Fahr. For meat-pies, tarts, 
etc., the heat should rise to 280°, and be reduced, after a quarter 
of an hour, to 220°. 



LESSON FOURTH. 
FRYING, AND THE CLAKIFYING OF BUTTEE, FAT, AND DEIPPING. 

The principles of Frying : 

1. You must have a clear, bright fire. 

N. B. — Be very careful it is not smoky. 

2. Be careful that the utensil used is very clean ; for if 
there is anything sticking at the bottom of the pan, it will 
quickly catch or burn, and so spoil the contents. 

3. Clarify all fat {not lard ), dripping, and butter be- 
fore using them, to remove the impurities from the former, 
and the buttermilk and other watery substance from the 
latter. 

N.B. — Fat need not be clarified more than once. After using it, 
always pour it off carefully in a basin, and, when it is cold, remove 
the sediment from the bottom of the cake otfat. Butter must be 
clarified each time it is used, to remove all watery substances. 



FRYING AND CLARIFYING. 13 

4. You must have the fat very hot ; good frying de- 
pends on the/a^ being properly heated. 

5. You should test the heat of the fat by a frimome- 
ter, if possible. The heat should rise to 345° Fahr. for 
ordinary frying, and 400° for whitebait, 

N. B. — If there is no frimometer, the heat of the/a< may be tested by 
the look — as fai gets quite still and begins to smoke when it is 
very hot — or by throwing in a small piece of crarah of bread ; and 
if it fries directly a light brown, the/a/ is ready for use. 

6. Use a deep pan, with plenty oifat, so that anything 
put in may be entirely covered. 

7. You can fry hacon in its own fat / it only requires 
watching and turning till it is done {see Lesson on " Liver 
and Bacon," from Note 1 to ^NTote 5). 

8. You may fry chops or steaJcs, or slices of ineat^ in 
an ounce of either clarified dripping or hutter. 

9. Melt the fat first, but it does not require to be 
heated. 

10. Be watchful, when the meat is frying, not to allow 
it to burn ; you should turn it over occasionally. 

N. B. — If there is a gridiron, it is much bettor to broil cJiops and 
steaks^ as it prevents their being greasy {see Lesson on a " Broiled 
Steak "). For frying Fish, see " Fish," Lessons Nos. 3, 6, 7, and 
13. For frying Meat, Rissoles, Potatoes, etc., see "Cooked Meat," 
Lessons Nos. 2 and 6 ; "Australian Meat," Lesson No. 8 ; " Entrees," 
Lessons Nos. 4 and 1 1 ; and " Vegetables," Lessons Nos. 3 and 4. 

To render down or clarify /a^ .• 

1. Take any scraps of cooked or uncooked fat, and cut 
them up in small pieces. 

2. Put the pieces in an old but clean saucepan, and 
pour in just enough cold water to cover them. 

3. Put the saucepan on the fire, and keep it boiling ; 



14 LESSONS IN COOKERY. 

it will take about an hour. The lid should be off the 
saucepan. 

4. Stir the/a^ occasionally, to prevent it from burning, 
or sticking to the bottom of the saucepan. 

5. When the water has evaporated, and the pieces of 
fat are cooked, pour the melted fat through an old sieve 
into a basin, and, when cold, it can be used for all frying 
purposes, instead of lard. 

To clarify dripjping : 

1. Put the dripping in the saucepan, and put it on the 
fire to boil. 

2. When it boils, pour it into a basin, in which there 
should be half a pint of cold water. 

3. When the dripping is cold, take a knife and cut 
round the edge, so as to take out the calce oj dripping. 

4 Scrape off all the sediment that will be found on the 
bottom of the cahe^ and wipe it dry with a cloth. 

To clarify hutter : 

1. Put the quantity of hutter required for present use 
in a small saucepan, and put it on the fire and let it boil. 

2. When the hutter has boiled, take a spoon and re- 
move the white scum from the top. 

3. Then pour the clear 'butter carefully into the pan for 
use, as below the hutter will be a little more watery suh- 
stance. 



CHAPTER III. 
THE BE-COOKIJfG OF MEAT. 



LESSON FIRST. 

HASHED MEAT.* 

Ingredients. — One pound of scraps of cold meat. Two small onions. One- 
half a turnip. One bunch of herbs.^ About a tablespoonful of flour. 
One dessertspoonful of mushroom catsup. Sippets of bread. Salt and 
pepper. Half an ounce of butter. 

Time required, about two hours ; or^ if the stock fw the gravy is already 
made, then only half an hour. 

To Hash Cold Meat: 

1. Take anj remains of cold meat, cut off all the meat 
from the bone, and cut it into thin shces. 

2. Chop the bone in pieces, and put them into a sauce- 
pan. 

3. Peel one onion, and cut it in quarters. 

^ The food called " Hash " in this country is more like the English minced 
meat {see Lesson No. 7, on " Re-cooked Meat "). 

' This means a small handful of parsley, a sprig of thyme or marjoram, 
one or both, and one bay-leaf. The parsley should be washed, the dried 
herbs placed in the midst of it, and the ends of the parsley should be folded 
around them, making a bunch about three inches long. Tie with a string, 
and trim away any leaves that might break oflf if left. This is known among 
cooks as a " bouquet garni," or " faggot." 



16 LESSONS IN COOKERY. 

4. Wash and scrape one carroty and cut it in quarters. 

5. Peel half a turnip^ and cut it in half. 

6. Wash a sjprig of parsley^ and dry it on a cloth. 

7. Take one hay-leaf^ one sprig of marjoram and 
thyme, and the parsley, and tie them tightly together with 
a piece of string. 

8. Put the herbs and vegetables into the saucepan with 
the bones, and cover them with cold water. 

9. Put tlie saucepan on the fire, and, when it boils, add 
pepper and salt^ according to taste. 

10. Kow put the lid on, and move the saucepan to 
the side of the fire, to stew gently for one hour^ or 
one hour and a half ; watch it, and skim it occasion- 
ally. 

11. Take a small onion, peel it, and cut it in slices. 

12. Put half am, ownce of butter into a frying-pan. 

13. Put the pan on the fire, and, when the butter 
is melted, add the sliced onion, and let it fry a nice 
brown. 

14. Shake the pan occasionally, to prevent the slices of 
onion from sticking to the bottom of the pan and burning. 

15. When the onion is sufficiently browned, strain off 
the butter, and put the onion on to a plate. 

16. Wheti the bones have stewed long enough, strain off 
the liquor into a basin. 

17. Wash out the saucepan, and pour back the liquor. 

18. Put a tablespoonful offiour into a small basin. 

19. Add a tablespoonful of the liquor to the flour, and 
stir it into a ^m.oo\h paste. 

20. Stir ihi^ paste gradually into the liquor in the sauce- 
pan. 

21. Add the browned onion and a dessertspoonful of 
mushroom catsup. 



THE RE-COOKING OF MEAT. 17 

22. Pat the saucepan on the fire, and stir the 5^1^^ until 
it boils and thickens. 

23. Let it boil for two or three minutes^ until the flour 
is cooked. 

N. B. — Be careful to stir the sauce smoothly while it boils, or it will 
be lumpy. 

24. Then move the saucepan to the side of the fire, and, 
when it is off the boil, lay in the pieces of meat^ to warm 
through. 

N. B. — Do not let the sauce boil while the meat is in it, or the meat 
will get hard and tough. 

25. Cut a thin slice of tread into square pieces. 

26. Cut these square pieces in half, cornerwise, making 
the pieces into triangles. 

27. Put one ounce of clarified drijyping {see Lesson on 
" Frying ") in a frying-pan, to melt. 

28. When the dripping is quite hot, put in the sippets 
of hread, and let them fry a light brown. 

29. Turn them, so that they will get browned on each 
side. 

30. Put a piece of kitchen-paper ^ on a plate, and, when 
the sipjpets are fried, turn them on to the paper to drain 
off the grease. 

N. B. — If liked, the bread could be toasted before the fire, instead of 
fried ; in which case it should be cut into sippets after it is toasted. 

31. For serving, put the slices of vuat on a hot dish in 
the centre, strain the sauce over them, and put the sippets 
of hread round the edge of the dish. 

' Kitchen-paper is unsized white paper, such as is used for wall-paper. It 
is common in English kitchens, and very convenient for many purposes.

LESSON SECOND. 

MEAT FRITTERS. 

Ingredients. — Slices of cold meat. Six ounces of flour. One tablespoon- 
ful of salad oil. Two eggs. Dripping for frying. 

2'bne requiredy about half an hour {and one hour for the hatter to rise). 

To make " Meat Fritters " — i. e., meat fried in batter : 

1. Put six ounces of flour and half a saltrsjpoonful of 
salt into a basin. 

2. Add a tablesjpoonful of salad oily and mix the flour 
into a smooth paste. 

N. B. — Be careful that the oil is sweet. One ounce of melted butter 
can be used instead. 

3. !N"ow stir in smoothly, by degrees, half a jpint of 
tepid water. Be careful that there are no lumps. 

4. Break two eggs ; put the whites on a plate. (The 
yolks should be put in a cup, as they will not be required 
for present use.) 

5. Sprinkle a quarter of a salt-sjpoonful of salt over the 
whites of the eggs, and whip them to a stiff froth with a 
knife. 

6. Stir the whipped whites of the eggs lightly into the 
latter. 

N. B. — In winter, clean snow might be used in the batter, instead of 
the whites of eggs. 

N. B. — This batter might be made without the whites of eggs, in 
which case'it should be mixed with half a pin't of beer, instead of 
the water ; but the batter made with beer will not rise as much as 
when eggs are used. 

N. B. — ^The beer will not taste after the batter is fried. 



THE RE-COOKING OF MEAT. 19 

7. Stand the hatter aside for one hour to rise, or until 
required for frying / but it should not stand longer than 
two hours. 

8. Put half a pound of clarified dripping (see Lesson 
on " Frying " ) into a saucepan, and put it on the fire to 
heat. 

9. Take some cold meat, and cut it up into thin slices. 

N. B. — Cold boiled or roast pork, or boiled bacon, is very nice fried 
in batter. 

10. When the latter has risen, and the fritters are re- 
quired for use, stir the hatter lightly with a spoon, so as to 
be sure that there are no lumps settled at the bottom. 

11. When the dripping is quite hot and smoking, take 
the slices of oneat, dip them in the hatter so as to quite 
cover them, and then drop them into the hot fat. 

N. B. — Do not put in too many slices at a time, as they should not 
touch each other. 

12. Turn them over, so that they will fry to a nice 
brown on both sides. 

13. Put a piece of Tcitchen-paper on a plate. 

14. As the fritters are fried, take them carefully out of 
the fat with 2^ perforated spoon, and put them on the paper, 
to drain off the grease. 

N. B. — Be careful to skim the fat from time to time, or the little loose 
pieces of batter will bum, and spoil the fat. 

N. B. — Slices of apple or orange can be fried in this batter in the 
same way, only that the batter should be sweetened, and sugar 
sprinkled over the fritters when they are fried. 

N. B. — ^Fish can be fried in batter the same way, only that the batter 
is usually made with beer, instead of white of egg. 

15. For serving, turn \kiQ fritters on to a hot dish.

GOBLET PIE. 

Ingredients. — Any scraps of cold meat. Two tablespoonfuls of chopped 
suet, two of moist sugar, two of currants, two of plums, and two of 
chopped apples. A quarter of a pound of flour. A quarter of a tea- 
spoonful of baking-powder. One ounce of dripping. 

7^me required^ about three-quarters of an hour. 

To make "Goblet Pie": 

1. Take any scraps of cold meat (even the smallest 
scraps, that would not do for anything else), put them 
on a board, ^ and chop them up as finely as possible. 
(There should be about two tahles]podnfuU of chojyped 
meat.) 

2. Take about two ounces of suet, put it on a board, 
cut away the sMn, and chop it up very finely. (There 
should be about two taMes^oonfuls) 

3. Peel two small apples, cut out the core, and chop 
them up finely. (There should be about two tablespoon- 
fuls.) 

4. Take two tablespoonfuls of plums, stone them, and 
chop them in small pieces. 

6. Wash two tablespoonfuls of currants, dry them in 
a cloth, and pick them over. 

6. Put all* these ingredients into a basin with two table- 
spoonfuls of moist sugar, and mix them all well together 
with a spoon. 

^ When only small quantities of things are to be made fine, it is very con- 
venient to place them upon a board, and, taking a sharp knife, hold down 
the free end of the blade with the left hand, and chop by moving the handle 
rapidly up and down with the right hand. Some cooks chop in this way 
upon the table, but a board is preferable. 



THE RE-COOKING OF MEAT. ^1 

7. Turn the mixture into a small pie-dish. 

8. Put a quarter of a potmd of flour into a basin, and 
mix into it a few grains of salt^ and a quarter of a tea- 
spoorful of haTcing-powder. 

9. Take one ounce of clarified dripping, and rub it 
well and lightly into the floicr with your hands, until it 
resembles sifted hread-crumhs. 

10. Add to it sufficient water to mix it into a ^ii^ jpaste. 

11. Flour a board, and turn the paste out on it. 

12. Take a rolling-pin, flour it, and roll out the paste to 
the shape of the pie-dish, only a little larger, and to about 
a quarter of an inch in thickness. 

13. Wet the edge of the pie-dish with water. 

14. Take a knife, dip it in flK)icr, and cut a strip of the 
paste the width of the edge of the pie-dish, and place it 
round the edge of the dish. 

15. Cut this strip of paste from round the edge of the 
paste, leaving the centre piece rather larger than the top 
of the pie-dish. 

16. Wet the edge of th.Q paste with water. 

17. Take the remaining piece of paste and place it over 
the pie-dish, pressing the edges together with your thumb. 

N. B. — ^Be very careful not to break the paste. 

18. Take a knife, dip it in flour, and trim off all the 
rough edges of \hQ paste round the edge of the dish. 

19. Take a knife, and with the back of the blade make 
little notches in the edge of the paste, pressing the paste 
firmly with your thumb, to keep it in its proper place. 

20. Make a little hole with the knife in the centre of 
the pie, to let the steam out while the pie is baking. 

21. Put the pie into the oven (the heat should rise to 
220°), to bake for half an hour.

CUERY. 

Ingredients. — Scraps of cold meat. Two ounces of clarified dripping, or 
butter. Two apples. One onion. One dessertspoonful of curry-powder. 
Salt. 

Time required, about three-quarters of an hour. 

To make a " Curry " : 

1. Put two ounces of clarified dripping, or "butter, into 
a saucepan, and put it on the fire to heat. 

2. Take one onion, peel it, put it on a board, and chop

of flour. Pepper and salt. 

71,me required, about one hour. 

To Stew a SteaJc (either beef or rump — the latter is 
more tender) : 

1. Put one pound of rurrip sieaJc, one and a half mch 
in thickness, on a board. 

2. Cut off all the skin and fat from the steaJc. 

3. Wash one carrot, one turnip, and a few celery-leaves, 
in cold water. 

4. Scrape the carrot clean with a sharp knife. 

6. Cut the turnip in half (as not all will be required), 
and peel off the outside skin. 

6. Peel the carrot and turnip into thin ribbons with a 
sharp knife, leaving just the centre of each vegetable. 

7. Peel one onion and put it on a board. 

8. Shred the onion and celery. 

9. Put one ounce of 'butter in a stewpan, and lay the 
steak in it to brown. 

10. Put the onion, celery, and the remains of the car- 
rot and turnip, after peeling, into the stewpan with the 
steak. 

11. Put the stewpan on the fire. 

12. Look occasionally at the steaJc, and when it is suffi- 
ciently browned on one side, turn it carefully over, to 
brown the other. 

13. When the steak is sufficiently browned on both 
sides, then put in the vegetables. 



ON COOKING MEAT. 93 

14. Take a basin and put in it a tablespoonful of flour, 
half a teaspoonful of salt, half a salt-spoonful of pepper, 
and mix them together with a wooden spoon, and one pint 
of water or stock. 

15. Stir them all well together into a smooth soAzce. 

16. Pour this sauce into the stewpan with the steaJc and 
vegetables, and stir all together until it boils and thickens. 

17. Let it gently simmer one hour. 

18. Take the fat which you have cut off the steah, and 
cut it into small pieces. 

19. Put the pieces of fat on a tin dish. 

20. Put the fat in the oven to cook till brown. 

N. B. — It is better for stewed steak to cook the fat separately, as it 
keeps the gravy of the steak free from grease. 

21. Take the thin peelings from the carrot and turnip, 
and put them on a board and shred them finely with a 
sharp knife. 

22. Put these shredded vegetoMes into a small saucepan, 
with about a gill of cold water. 

23. Put the saucepan on the fire, and let it boil until 
the vegetables are quite tender when tried with a fork. 

24. When the steah is sufficiently stewed, put it on a 
hot dish. 

25. Take a strainer and strain the gravy, in which the 
steah has-been stewed, over the stealc. 

26. The stewed vegetables must be thrown away, as all 
the goodness is out of them. 

27. Take the tin dish out of the oven, and place the 
pieces of fat about on the stealc. 

28. Take the boiled shredded vegetables and garnish the 
steak with them. 

N. B. — Any other vegetables can be used for garnishing — ^i. e., peas, 
French beans, asparagus, etc.

salt-spoonful of salt. 

2. Break one egg into the fl^ur, and stir in smoothly, 
and by degrees, one pint of milk. 

N. B. — ^Be careful that it is not lumpy. 

3. Beat it up as much as possible, as it will make the 
hatter lighter. 

4. Take one pound of meat, put it on a board, and cut 
it in neat pieces. 

N. B. — Buttock steak, beef skirt, or any pieces of mutton, might be used ; 
for instance, the short bones from the neck of mutton. Sausages or 
cold meat might very well be used. 

5. Take a pie-dish, or a tin, and grease it inside with 
clarified dripping. 

6. Season the pieces of meat with pepper and salt, and 
place them in the greased dish.

LESSON FIRST. 

TRUSSING A FOWL FOE ROASTING. 

Ingredients. — One fowl. One ounce of butter. One large roll. One 
onion. Half a pint of milk. Five pepper-coms. Salt. One tablespoon- 
ful of cream. 

Time required^ db<mt three-quarters of an hour. 

To prepare a Fowl and Truss it for Roasting : 

1. Take a suitable fowl that has been already plucked, 
and put it on a board. 

2. Turn t\iQfowl on its breast, and make an incision of 
an inch long down the neck, three inches below the head. 

3. Pass your thumb round this incision, and loosen the 
skin. 

4. Take a sharp knife and pu^ it under the shim^^ and 
cut off the neck as low down as possible. 

5. Be careful, in cutting off the neck, to leave a piece 
of skin to fold over on to the back of the neck and cover 
the opening. 

6. Take out the crop, which lies in the front of the 
neck. 



96 LESSONS IN COOKERY. 

7. Then, with your finger, loosen the liver and the 
other parts at the breast-end. 

8. Now turn the fowl round, and make an incision at 
the vent, about one inch and a half wide. 

9. Put your hand through this incision into the body, 
and draw out all the interiors carefully, so as not to mess 
the fowl, 

10. Be very careful not to break the gall-bag, or the 
li/cer will be spoiled. 

N. B. — Take the liver^ hearty and gizzard^ and put them in a basin of 
water, with about half a teaspoonful of salt ; the other interiors 
should be thrown away. 

N. B. — Look through the fowl from one end to the other, and see that 
it is perfectly cleared out. 

11. Take a damp cloth and wipe out the inside of the 
fowly to clean it thoroughly. 

N. B. — If the fowl is not quite fresh, use a little vinegar and water on 
the cloth in cleaning it, and then take a clean cloth and wipe it 
quite dry. 

12. Take a sharp knife and cut off the claws from the 
legs of the fowl. 

13. Take a basin of boiling water, and hold the ends of 
the legs of \hQfowl in the water for a minute or two. 

14. Then take off the outside sMn as far as to the first 
joint. 

16. Take a twist of paper, or a taper, and light it. 

16. Take the fowl up by its legs, and hold the lighted 
paper under it, to singe off the little hairs. 

17. Then hold the fowl up by its wings and singe the 
other end. 

N. B, — Be careful, in singeing, not to blacken or mark the fowl in 
any way. 

18. Turn the fowl on its breast, and draw tightly the 
breast-skin over the incision on to the back of the neck. 



COOKING POULTRY. 97 

19. Cross the ends of the wings over the back of the 
neck. 

20. JS'ow turn the fowl on its back, with the neck 
toward you. 

21. Take a trussing-needle and thread it with fine twine. 

22. Hold the legs up and press the thighs well into the 
sides of the fowl^ forcing the breast up, to give the fowl 
a good shape. 

23. Take the threaded trussing-needle and pass it 
through the bottom of one thigh, through the body, and 
out on the other side through the other thigh. 

N. B. — If liked, a part of the gizzard and livcr^ when cleaned {see note 
at the end of " Trussing a Fowl for Boiling "), can be put into the 
wings of the fowl. 

24. Kow turn the fowl on its breast, and take the 
threaded trussing-needle again and pass it through the 
middle of the pinion or wing, through the little bone 
called the sidesman or step-mother's wing, catching up 
the skin which folds over the incision, and out through 
the other little bone and wing. 

25. Pull this twine very tightly, and tie it as firmly as 
possible at the side of the fowl. 

26. Turn the fowl over on its back, keeping the neck 
still toward you. 

27. Put your finger in the incision (made for drawing 
the/b^^Z), and lift up the end of the breast-bone. 

28. Take the threaded trussing-needle and pass it through 
the skin over the bottom of the breast-bone, over the end 
of one leg, back through the body close to the back-bone, 
and tie it firmly over the other leg at the side. 

N. B. — If there is no gravy ready for serving with the roast fowl, 
prepare it now (see note at the end). 



98 LESSONS IN COOKERY. 

29. !N"ow put the tin oven, with the jack and dripping- 
pan, before the fire. 

80. Make up the fire in the same manner as described 
in "Boasting." 

N. B. — You do not require such a large fire as for roasting meat. 

31. Take the trussed fowl, and pass the hook of the jack 
through the back of the fowl, and hang it up on the jack. 

N. B. — If the fire is very fierce, you should take a piece of whity- 
brown paper, butter it, and tie it over the fowl, so as to prevent 
it from burning. 

32. Put one ounce of butter in the dripping-pan to melt. 

33. Use this melted butter to baste the fowl ; as the 
fowl is not very fat, there will not be much dripping 
from it. 

34. The fowl will take from half an hour to three-quar- 
ters of an hour to roast, according to its size. 

35. Baste the fowl frequently. 

36. When the fowl is quite done, take it off the jack 
and put it on a hot dish. 

37. Take a knife and cut the twine, and draw it all out 
of the fowl, and take off the paper before serving. 

For making Bread-Sauce : 

1. Take a French penny-roll and cut it in half. 

2. Pull out all the inside crumb and put it on a plate. 

3. Pull this crurrib apart into small pieces. 

N. B. — If a French roll cannot be procured, bread-crumbs can be used 
instead — about one ounce and a half. 

4. Take a small onion and peel it with an onion-knife. 

6. Take a small stewpan and put in it the peeled onion. 
^. V owe m half a pint of milk, 

7. JS'ow put in the crumb of the roll. 

8. KA^ five pepper-corns^ and salt to taste. 



COOKING POULTRY. 99 

9. Stand the stewpan aside, with the lid on, for a 
quarter of an hour, to soak the crumb. 

10. After that time, put the stewpan on the fire, and 
stir the sauce smoothly with a wooden spoon, until it boils. 

11. Now add a tablesjpoonful of cream, and stir the 
sauce until it just boils again. 

12. Before serving the sauce, take out the onion, and 
then pour it into a sauce-tureen. 

N. B. — ^The neck^ gizzard, liver, and claws of the fowl, when properly 
prepared {see note at the end of " Trussing a Fowl for Boiling "), 
can be used for soup or gravy, to be served with the roast foiol. 
For making the gravy, put the giblets into a saucepan, with enough 
water to cover them (about half a pint) ; also add half an onion 
(peeled), six pepper-corns, and salt to taste. Put the saucepan on 
the fire, and, when it comes to the boil, move it to the side, to 
simmer while the fowl is roasting. 

N. B.-^For serving, strain the gravy into a basin, and color it, if 
necessary, by stirring in a quarter of a teaspoonf ul of " Liehig^s 
Extract,^'' or ten or twelve drops of caramel {see note at the end of 
" Australian Meat," Lesson No. 2, " Brown Pur6e ") ; then pour it 
in a sauce-tureen, or round the/ow?. 



LESSON SECOND. 
TRUSSING A FOWL FOR BOILING. 

Ingredients. — One fowl. One and a quarter ounce of butter. Stock or 
water. One carrot. One small onion. A bouquet of herbs. Two eggs. 
One ounce of flour. One-half a pint of milk. A gill of cream. 

Time required, about one hour and a quarter. 

To prepare a Fowl and Truss it for Boiling : 

1. Take a fowl that has been already plucked and put 
it on a board. 

2. Prepare it and clean it in the same way as de- 
scribed in " Trussing a Fowl for Boasting," from Note 1 
to I^ote 12. 



100 LESSONS IN COOKERY. 

3. Take a sharp knife and cut off the claws and the 
ends of the legs of \he,fowl^ to the first joint. 

4. Take a twist of paper, or taper, and light it. 

6. Take the fowl up by its legs, and hold the lighted 
paper under it, to singe off the little hairs. 

6. Then hold the fowl up by its wings and singe the 
other end. 

N. B. — Be careful, in singeing, not to blacken or mark the fowl in 
any way. 

7. Turn ih^fowl on its back, with the tail toward you. 

8. Put your hands through the incision (made for 
drawing the fowT)^ and pass two fingers round the inside 
of the leg, so as to loosen the outside skin. 

9. Draw this outside skin right off the legs, and press 
the legs well into the sides of the fowl^ forcing the breast 
up, so as to give ih.Q fowl a good shape. 

10. Pull this outside skin, and turn it neatly inside the 
fowl, over the joints of the legs. 

11. Turn the fowl on its breast, and draw tightly the 
breast-skin over the incision on to the back of the neck. 

12. Cross the ends of the wings over the back of the 
neck. 

13. Now turn the fowl on its back, with the neck 
toward you. 

14. Take a trussing-needle and thread it with fine twine. 

15. Take the threaded trussing-needle and pass it through 
the bottom of one thigh, through the body, and out on 
the other side through the other thigh. 

16. Now turn the fowl on its breast, and take the 
threaded trussing-needle again and pass it through the 
middle of the pinion or wing, through the little bone 
called the sidesman or step-mother's wing, catching up 



COOKING POULTRY. 101 

the skin whicli folds over the incision, and out through 
the other little bone and wing. 

17. Pull, this twine very tightly, and tie it as firmly as 
possible at the side of i\iefowl. 

18. Turn the fowl over on its back, keeping the neck 
still toward you. 

19. Put your finger in the incision (made for drawing 
i\\Qfowl)^ and lift up the end of the breast-bone. 

20. Take the threaded trussing-needle and pass it 
through the skin over the bottom of the breast-bone, over 
one leg, back through the body close to the back-bone, 
and tie it firmly over the other leg at the side. 

21. Take a piece of kitchen-paper and butter it well. 

22. Take this piece of buttered paper and wrap it well 
round i\iQfowl. 

23. Take a large saucepan half full of hot second white 
stock or water, and put it on the fire. 

N. B. — The reason why second white stock should be used is, that the 
goodness which comes from the fowl after boiling adds to the good- 
ness of this stock, which can afterward be used for soup. 

N. B. — If hot water is used, the goodness which comes from the fowl 
after boiling is only wasted, as it is not of sufficient strength to 
make the large quantity of water of any use. 

24. When the water is quite boiling, place the fowl in 
the saucepan, with its breast downward. 

25. Put into the saucepan one carrot which has been 
scraped, a small onion which has been peeled, and a 
bouquet of herbs, for flavoring. 

26. The fowl will take from three-quarters of an hour 
to one hour to boil, according to its size. 

To make the Egg-Sauce to be served with the Boiled 
Fowl: 

1. Take a small saucepan full of hot water, and put it 
on the fire to boil. 



102 LESSONS IN COOKERY. 

2. When the water is quite boiling, put in two eggs to 
boil for ten minuteSo 

3. Take a stewpan and put in it one ounce of hutter 
and one ounce of flour. 

4. Mix them well together with a wooden spoon. 

5. Pour in half a pint of milk, 

6. Put the stewpan on the fire, and stir the mixture 
with a wooden spoon until it boils and thickens. 

7. Then remove the stewpan to the side of the fire 
until required for use. 

8. When the eggs are sufficiently boiled, take them 
carefully out of the saucepan with a spoon. 

9. Knock the eggs against the edge of a basin, to break 
off all the shell. 

10. Take a small basin of cold water. 

11. Cut the eggs in half and take out the yolks. 

12. Put the whites into cold water, to prevent their 
turning yellow. 

13. Take the whites of the eggs out of the water and 
cut them to the shape of small dice. 

14. Add the pieces of white of ^gg to the sauce in the 
stewpan. 

15. IS'ow add one gill of cream to the sauce. 

16. Move the stewpan to the centre of the fire, and stir 
well till it boils again. 

N. B. — Be careful, in stirring, not to break the pieces of egg. 

17. When the fowl is sufficiently boiled, take it out of 
the stewpan ; take off the buttered paper, and place the 
foiol on a hot dish. 

18i With a knife cut the twine, and draw it all out of 
^^fowl. 

19. Take the stewpan off the fire, and pour the scmce 
over the yb^oZ. 



COOKING POULTRY. 103 

20. Take a wire sieve, with the hard-boiled yoTks of the 
eggs^ place it over the fowl^ and rub the yolks through on 
to the breast. 

N. B. — The neck, gizzard, liver, heart, and claws of the fowl — namely, 
the gihleU — should be put aside, and, when properly prepared, 
can be used for soup {see " Soups," Lesson Sixth), or should be 
put in the stock-pot 

N. B. — To clean and prepare the giblets for use : 

A. — Take the gizzard^ cut it very carefully with a knife down the cen- 
tre, where there is a sort of seam (be sure only to cut the first or 
outer skin), and draw off the outer skin without breaking the in- 
side, which should be thrown away. 

B. — Take the outer skin of the gizzard^ the hearty and liver^ wash them 
well in water, and dry them in a cloth. 

C. — Take the neck^ cut off the head^ which is of no use, draw the skin 
off the neck, and wash the latter well in water, so as to remove 
the blood and any impurities. 

D. — Put the claws and ends of legs in a basin of boiling water for 
some minutes ; then take a knife, cut off the nailsy and draw off 
the ovier skin^ which can be pulled off like a glove. 



CHAPTER IX. 
STOCK AJTD SOUPS. 



LESSON PIRST. 

STOCK. 

Ingredients. — ^Four pounds of shin of beef, or two pounds of knuckle of 
veal, and two pounds of beef. Four young carrots, or two old ones. One 
turnip. One onion. One leek. Half a head of celery. Salt. 

l^ime required^ about five hours. It should he made the day before it is re- 
quired for use. 

To make StocJc for Soup : 

1. Take fov/r pounds of shin of heef and put it on a 
board. 

2. Cut off all the meat from tlie bone with a sharp 
knife. 

3. Cut off all the fat from the meat. (Put it aside for 
other purposes.) 

4. Take a chopper and break the bone in half. 

5. Take out all the marrow and put it aside for other 
uses. 

N. B. — If the fat and marrow were to go into the stock, it would 
make it greasy.* 

6. Take a stock-pot, or a large stewpan, and put the 
meat and hone into it. 

' Which is no great matter, as appears from 21. 



STOCK AND SOUPS. 105 

7. Pour in five pmts of cold water. 

N. B. — One pint of water is allowed for each pound of meat, and one 
pint over.^ 

8. Put in half a teaspoonful of salt. This will assist 
the scum to rise. 

9. Put the stock-pot on the fire with the lid on, and 
let it come to the boil quickly. 

10. Take four yoimg carrots^ scrape them clean with a 
knife, and cut them in pieces. 

11. Take one turnijp and one onion, peel them, and cut 
them in quarters. 

12. Take a leek and half a head of celery ^ and wash 
them well in cold water. 

13. Take a spoon and remove the scum from the stock 
as it yises. 

14i ]N^ow put in all the 'vegetables, and let it simmer 
gently iov five hours. 

15. Watch and skim it occasionally, and add a little 
cold water, to make the scum rise. 

16. Take a clean cloth and put it over a good-sized basin. 

17. Put a hair-sieve on the top of the cloth over the 
basin. 

18. When the stoclc has been simmering for five hours, 
take the stock-pot off the fire. 

19. Pour the contents into the sieve which contains the 
meat, lone, and vegetables ; and the cloth very effectually 
strains the stoclc. 

N. B. — The meat and bone can be used again, with the addition of 
fresh vegetables and water, and you thus make what is called 
second stock." 

» One pint of water extra is added to every two quarts, on account of 
evaporation. 

^ Second stock cannot be used for clear soup unless it is first clarified, as 
shown in Lesson Third. 



106 LESSONS IN COOKERY. 

20. Take the basin (into which the stock has been 
strained) and put it in a cool place till the next day, when 
it will be a stiff jelly. 

21. When this stock-jelly is required for use, take off 
the hardened fat from the top with a spoon. 

22. Take a clean cloth and dip it in hot water, and 
wipe over the top of the jelly, to remove every particle 
of fat. 

23. Now take a clean dry cloth, and wipe the top of 
the jelly dry. 

N. B. — This is brown stock ; but for some soups and purees, as well 
as for many other purposes, white stock is required. This is made in 
the same way, only with veal instead of beef. It can also be made 
of veal and beef mixed, or rabbit and beef ; but veal alone is con- 
sidered best. 



LESSON SECOND. 

VEGETABLE STOCK. 

Ingredients. — One cabbage. Three large or six small onions. Two carrots. 
One turnip. Two ounces of butter. Three cloves. Thirty pepper-corns. 
A bunch of herbs (thyme, marjoram, and a bay-leaf). Salt. 

Time required^ about two hmtrs and a quarter. 

To make Vegetable Stock : 

1. Take one cabbage^ wash it well in cold water, and 
cut it in quarters. 

2. Take two carrots^ wash them, scrape them clean, 
and cut them in quarters. 

3. Take one turnip, peel it, and cut it in quarters. 

4. Take three la/rge or six small onions and wash them 
clean. (The skins are to be left on.) 

5. Put all these vegetables into a saucepan, with two 
oimces of butter. 



STOCK AND SOUPS. 107 

6. Add a hunch of herbs (namely, a s^ig of thyme, 
marjoram^ and a hay-leaf), tied tightly together, three 
cloves, and thirty pepper-corns. 

7. Put the saucepan on the fire, and let the vegetables 
and herbs sweat in the butter for ten minutes. Stir them, 
to prevent burning. 

8. Kow pour in three qua/rts of cold water, and add 
salt according to taste. 

9. When the water boils, move the saucepan to the 
side of the fire, and let it simmer gently for two hours. 
Watch it, and skim it occasionally. 

10. After that time, strain the stoch into a basin, and it 
is ready for use. It is now reduced to two quarts and 
one-half a pint. 

K B. — This stock can be used for thick vegetable soups. 



LESSON THIRD. 
CLEAR SOUP. 

Ingredients. — Two quarts of stock. Three-quarters of a pound of gravy- 
beef. Two carrots. Two turnips. One and one-half a leek. One cab- 
bage-lettuce. One tablespoonf ul of young peas. Salt. One lump of sugar. 

Time required {the stock should be made the day before)^ about one hour and a 
half. 

To make Clear Soup : 

1. Take two quarts of stock ^ {see Lesson First on 
" Stock "), and be careful to remove from it all fat. 

* This lesson only applies to second stock, or stock that, for any reason, 
has become turbid. Stock carefully made by the directions in Lesson First on 
*' Stock " is already clear, if a little care is taken to separate the sediment at 
the bottom of the jelly. It is only second stock, or stock made from odds 
and ends of meat and bones, cooked and uncooked, that requires to be clarified. 



108 LESSONS IN COOKERY. 

2. Put the stock into a stewpan. 

3. Take three-quarters of a pound of gravy-beef (from 
the shin of beef), put it on a board, and cut off all the 
fat and skin with a sharp knife. 

4. Chop the beef up very fine. 

N.B. — The proportion of beef for clarifying stock is one pound to 
every five pounds of meat with which the stock is made. 

5. Put the chopped gravy-leef into the stewpan. 

6. Take one carrot, one turnip, and one leek, and wash 
them well in cold water. 

7. Take the vegetables out of the water and put them 
on a board. 

8. Take a sharp knife and scrape the carrot quite clean, 
and slice it up. 

9. Take the turnvp, peel it, and cut it in small pieces. 

10. Take the leek and cut off part of the long green 
leaves and the little straggling roots, and chop up the 
remainder fine. 

11. Put all these vegetables into the stewpan, and stir 
them with an iron spoon until they are well mixed with 
the heef and stock. 

12. Put the stewpan on the fire, and stir the contents 
till boiling begins. 

13. Now take a large spoon and carefully skim the 
surface. 

14. Stand the stewpan by the side of the fire, and let it 
simmer gently for twenty minutes. 

15. Take a clean soup-cloth and fix it on the soup-stand.^ 

16. Take a large basin and place it below the cloth. 

^ A soup-stand is easily improvised by turning bottom upward a seat 
which has no back, and tying the four comers of your napkin to the ends of 
its four legs. 



STOCK AND SOUPS. 109 

17. Take the stewpan oS the fire and pour the contents 
into the cloth, and let it all pass into the basin. 

N. B. — The chopped gravy-beef acts as a filter to the soup. 

18. After the soup has all passed through, remove the 
basin and put a clean one in its place. 

19. Take a soup-ladle and pour a little of the soup at a 
time over the meat in the cloth, and let it pass through 
very slowly. 

N. B. — Be careful not to disturb the deposit of chopped beef which 

settles at the bottom of the cloth. 
N. B. — If savory custard is preferred in the soup instead of shredded 

vegetables, see No. 31. 

20. Take a small carrot, turnip, half a leek, cdbhage-let- 
tuce, and a tahlespoonful of young peas, and wash them

N. B. — This same mixture, if poured into Ramaquin papers and baked, 
will make cheese Ramaquins. 

19. Put the tin in a hot oven to bake from twenty min- 
utes to half an hour. Look at it once or twice to see that 
it does not bum ; but the door of the oven should not be 
opened too often while the souffle is inside, lest it should 
check the souffle from rising properly. 

N. B. — To serve a baked soufH6, it should be kept in the tin, the 
buttered paper taken off, and a clean napkin folded round the 
tin. It can also be baked in a mould, which slips inside a plated- 
silver dish sold for the purpose. This is the more elegant way of 
serving a souflfle or fondu.

CHAPTER XXIII 
CAJ{J^ED MEATS. 



Note. — ^In the English edition of this work, the present chapter appeared 
under the title of " Australian Meat," which consists of cooked and canned 
meats that are brought into England in large variety, and are coming into 
such general use there that it was found desirable to give them some atten- 
tion at the training-school. "Australian Meat," however, is not to be ob- 
tained in the American market ; but as we have its equivalent in the canned 
meats put up in this country, the title of the chapter has been changed, to 
prevent misapprehension and inconvenience. 

The directions in the following lessons are not so much for cooking canned 
meats — which are indeed already cooked — as for using them as ingredients of 
various complex dishes, such as soups, stews, curries, fricassees, and hashes, 
and for these purposes the American canned preparations answer just as well 
as the Australian. For such uses canned meats deserve more attention than 
they generally receive.^ Everybody now understands the value of having 
fruits and vegetables — such as peaches, cherries, pears, tomatoes, corn, beans, 
peas, and asparagus — ready at hand, as they not only give an agreeable and 
healthy variety to diet, but are easily and quickly prepared, and thus save 
labor and trouble to the house-keeper. The advantages are the same with 
canned meats, especially in the country, where markets are not near by. 
And even in competition with butcher's meat, canned beef and mutton do not 
make a bad showing in point of economy ; for when beef and mutton are 
procured from the market, there is not only a loss by the removal of bone, 
fat, and gristle, but also a loss of weight in the operation of cooking, so that 
the meat upon the table should properly be estimated at nearly double the 
market-price. As the canned meats consist of the pure muscular fibres, with 

1 Tet their use is rapidly extending. We were informed by Mr. Alexander "Wiley, the 
intelligent superintendent of the department of " canned goods " in the establishment of 
H. K. «fe F. B. Thurber, of New York, that this trade has doubled in a comparatively short 
time, while the saving to the country through this preservation of perishable food-prod- 
ucts is probably not less than fifty million dollars annually. 



CANNED MEATS. 309 

their contained nutritive juices, these sources of loss are avoided ; and while 
the expense is no greater, the trouble of preparation is saved. 

In purchasing canned meats, much depends upon the character of the 
articles, and the buyer will consult his interest by purchasing only well-known 
brands. Among these are Thurber & Co., Wilson, Libby, Underwood, and 
Richardson & Robbins. Almost everything in the way of meat is to be had 
thus preserved, but different establishments confine themselves more or less 
to special preparations. As an example of the variety of animal products 
that are furnished in this manner, the following are selected from Thurber's 
Price-List of June 6, 1878 : Corned beef, beef tongue, mutton, ham, lamb's 
tongue, pig's feet, tripe, sausage, pork and beans, turkey, duck, chicken, 
clams, clam broth, lobster, oysters, green turtle, salmon, shrimps, codfish- 
balls, julienne, mock-turtle and ox-tail soups, condensed milk. Most of 
these articles are, moreover, prepared in a variety of forms. — Editor,

fully, and remove the fat from the part of the meat re- 
quired for immediate use. 

6. Take one and a half jpound of the meat out of the 
tin. 

7. If all the meat is required for present use, turn it 
all out of the tin, and then rinse out the tin with half a 
j^nt of warm water ^ to make the gravy for the hash. 

N. B. — If all the meat has not been taken out of the tin, take some of 
the jelly out of the tin, and melt it in half a pint of warm water, 
to make the gravy.

PRINCIPLES OF DIET

HEALTH AND DISEASE.

THOMAS K. CHAMBERS, M.D.

THE "encyclopedia BEITANNICA."] 



THE PRINCIPLES OF DIET IN HEALTH AND DISEASE. 



THE application of science to the regulation of the continuous 
demands of the body for nutriment aims mainly at three ob- 
jects : Health, Pleasure, and Economy. They are rarely inconsistent 
with one another, but yet require separate consideration, as, under 
varying circumstances, each may claim the most prominent place in 
our thoughts. 

Influence of Diet upon Health. 

The influence of diet upon the health of a man begins at the ear- 
liest stage of his life, and, indeed, is then greater than at any other 
period. It is varied by the several phases of internal growth and of 
external relations, and in old age is still important in prolonging 
existence and rendering it agreeable and useful. 

Diet in Infancy. — No food has as yet been found so suitable for 
the young of all animals as their mother's milk. And this has not 
been from want of seeking. Dr. Brouzet ("Sur I'fiducation M6dici- 
nale des Enfants," i., p. 165) has such a bad opinion of human mothers, 
that he expresses a wish for the State to interfere and prevent them 
from suckling their children, lest they should communicate immoral- 
ity and disease ! A still more determined pessimist was the famous 
chemist. Van Helmont, who thought life had been reduced to its 
present shortness by our inborn propensities, and proposed to substi- 
tute bread boiled in beer and honey for milk, which latter he calls 
"brute's food." Baron Liebig has followed the lead with a "food 
for infants," in the prescription for which half-ounces and quarter- 
grains figure freely, and which has to be prepared on a slow fire, 
and after a few minutes boiled well. And after all, not nearly such 
a close imitation of human milk is made as by the addition to fresh 



330 DIET IN HEALTH AND DISEASE. 

cow's milk of half its bulk of soft water, in each pint of which has 
been mixed a heaped-up teaspoonful of powdered " sugar of milk " 
and a pinch of phosphate of lime. Indeed, in default of these cheap 
chemicals, the milk and water alone, when fresh and pure, are safer 
than an artificial compound which requires cooking. And experi- 
ence shows that the best mode of administering food to the young is 
also that which is most widely adopted throughout warm-blooded 
nature — namely, in a fresh, tepid, liquid state, frequently, and in 
small quantities at a time. 

Empirical observation is fully supported in these deductions by 
physiological and chemical science. Milk contains of 

Water 88 per cent. 

Oleaginous matter (cream or butter) 8 " 

Nitrogenous matter (cheese and albumen) 4 "^ 

Hydrocarbon (sugar) 4J "^ 

Saline matter (phosphate of lime, chloride of sodium, iron, etc.) . | " 

These are at once the constituents and the proportions of the con- 
stituents of food suited to a weakly, rapidly-growing animal. The 
large quantity of water makes it pass easily through the soft, ab- 
sorbent walls of the digestive canal ; and the complete suspension, 
in an alkaline fluid, of the finely-divided fat and nitrogenous matter 
introduces more of them than could be effected were they in a solid 
form. The fat is the germ of new cellular growtli, and the nitro- 
genous matter is by the new cells formed into flesh, which is doubling 
its bulk monthly. The phosphate of lime is required for the harden- 
ing bones, the chloride of sodium and the iron for the daily-increasing 
amount of blood in circulation. Milk may be said to be still alive as 
it leaves the breast fresh and warm, and quickly becomes living 
blood in the infant's veins. A very slight chemical change is requi- 
site. Its frequent administration is demanded by the rapid absorp- 
tion, and the absence of regular meals prevents the overloading of 
the delicate young stomach with more than it can hold at once. 

The wholesomest nutriment for the first six months is milk alone. 
A vigorous baby can, indeed, bear with impunity much rough usage, 
and often appears none the worse for a certain quantity of farina- 
ceous food ; but the majority do not get habituated to it without 
an exhibition of dislike, which indicates rebellion of the bowels. 

To give judicious diet its fair chance, the frame must be well 
protected from the cold ; and just in proportion as the normal tern- 



THE FOOD OF INFANCY. 331 

perature of the body is maintained, so does growth prosper, as is 
satisfactorily proved by experiments on the young of the lower 
animals. 

It is only when the teeth are on their way to the front, as shown 
by dribbling, that the parotid glands secrete an active saliva capable 
of digesting bread-stuffs. Till then, anything but milk must be given 
tentatively, and considered in the light of a means of education for 
its future mode of nutrition. Among the varieties of such means, 
the most generally applicable are broth and beef-tea, at first pure, 
and then thickened with tapioca and arrow-root. Chicken-soup, 
made with a little cream and sugar, serves as a change. Baked flour, 
biscuit-powder, tops and bottoms, should all have their turn. Change 
is necessary in the imperfect dietary which art supplies, and for 
change the stomach should be prepared by habit. 

The consequences of premature weaning are insidious. The 
external aspect of the child is that of health ; its muscles are strong, 
but the bones do not harden in proportion ; and if it tries to walk, 
its limbs give way, and it is said to be suffering from rachitis, or 
*' rickets." 

These consequences follow in other animals as surely as in the 
human race ; and in them it was possible to make the experiment 
crucial. A gentleman named GuSrin set himself to find if he could 
produce rickets at will. He took a number of puppies in equally 
good condition, and, having let them suckle for a time, he suddenly 
weaned half of them and fed them on raw meat — a fare which on 
first thought would seem the most suitable for carnivorous animals. 
Nevertheless, after a short time those which continued to take the 
mother's milk had grown strong and hearty, while those which had 
been treated with a more substantial dietary pined, and frequently 
threw up their victuals, then their limbs bent, and at the end of about 
four months they showed all the symptoms of confirmed rickets. From 
these experiments we must conclude that the rachitis depended 
mainly on the derangements of nutrition brought on by improper 
diet. A diet which is taken at the wrong season may fairly be 
called improper. For carnivora, it is flesh before the age of suckling 
has passed ; for herbivora (and an experiment bearing on the point 
has been made on pigs), it is vegetable feeding begun when they 
ought to be at the teat.^

332 DIET IN HEALTH AND DISEASE. 

The time for weaning should be fixed partly by the child's age, 
partly by the growth of the teeth. The troubles to which children 
are subject at this crisis are usually gastric, such as are induced by 
summer weather ; therefore at that season the weaning should be 
postponed, whereas in winter it should be hurried forward. The 
first group of teeth, nine times out of ten, consists of the lower cen- 
tral front teeth, which may appear any time during the sixth and 
seventh month. The mother may then begin to diminish the num- 
ber of suckling times ; and by a month she can have reduced them to 
twice a day, so as to be ready, when the second group makes its way 
through the upper front gums, to cut off the supply altogether. The 
third group — the lateral incisors and first grinders — usually after the 
first anniversary of birth give notice that solid food can be chewed. 
But it is prudent to let dairy-milk form a considerable portion of the 
fare till the eye-teeth are cut, which seldom happens till the eighteenth 
or twentieth month. At this period children are liable to diarrhoea, 
convulsions, irritation of the brain, rashes, and febrile catarrhs. In 
such cases it is often advisable to resume a complete milk-diet, and 
sometimes a child's life has been saved by its reapplication to the 
breast. These means are most feasible when the patient is accus- 
tomed to milk ; indeed, if not, the latter expedient is hardly possible. 

Diet in Childhood and Youth. — At this stage of life the diet must 
obviously be the best which is a transition from that of infancy to 
that of adult age. Growth is not completed, but yet entire surren- 
der of every consideration to the claim of growth is not possible, nor 
indeed desirable. Moreover, that abundance of adipose tissue, or 
reserve new growth, which a baby can bear, is an impediment to the 
due education of the muscles of the boy or girl. The supply of nu- 
triment needs not to be so continuous as before, but at the same time 
should be more frequent than for the adult. Up to at least fourteen 
or fifteen years of age the rule should be four meals a day, varied 
indeed, but nearly equal in nutritive power and in quantity — that is 
to say, all moderate, all sufficient. The maturity the body then 
reaches involves a hardening and enlargement of the bones and car- 
tilages, and a strengthening of the digestive organs, which in healthy 
young persons enables us to dispense with some of the watchful care 
bestowed upon their diet. Three full meals a day are generally suffi- 
cient, and the requirements of mental training may be allowed to a 
certain extent to modify the attention to nutrition, which has hith- 



DIET IN CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH. 333 

erto been paramount. But it must not be forgotten that the changes 
in figure and in internal organs are not completed till several years 
have passed, and that they involve increased growth and demand 
full supplies. As less bulky food is used, care should be taken that 
it is sufficiently nutritious, and habits should be acquired which con- 
duce to making the most of it for the maintenance of strength. 

The nutritiousness of food depends on digestibility and concentra- 
tion. Food is digestible when it yields readily its constituents to the 
fluids destined for their reduction to absorbable chyme. It is more 
or less concentrated, according as a given weight contains more or 
less matter capable of supporting life. The degree in which they 
possess these qualifications united constitutes the absolute nutritive 
value of alimentary matters. 

The degree of cohesion in the viands influences digestibility. 
Tough articles incapable of being completely ground up by the teeth re- 
main unused, while fluids and semifluids lead the van of digestibles. The 
tissues of young vegetables and young animals are, for this reason, 
more digestible than old specimens. It is desirable also that the post- 
mortem rigidity, which lasts several days in most instances, should 
have merged into softness before the meat is cooked, or should have 
been anticipated by cooking before the flesh is cold. In warm cli- 
mates and exceptionally warm weather, the latter course is the pref- 
erable. The dietician, especially when the feeding of the young is 
in question, will prefer those methods of culinary preparation which 
most break up the natural cohesion of the viands. And it may be 
noticed that the force of cohesion acts in all directions, and that it is 
no advantage for an article to be laterally friable if it remains stringy 
in a longitudinal direction. 

Fat interposed between the component parts of food diminishes 
its digestibility. It is the interstitial fat, between the fasciculi of 
muscular fibre in beef, which renders it to young persons, and to 
dyspeptics, less digestible than mutton. 

A temperature above that of the body retards digestion. Meat, 
which is digested by the gastric juice in the stomach, has time to 
cool before it gets there ; but farinaceous food, which depends for 
its conversion into chyme on the salivary glands, suffers a serious 
loss if, by reason of being too hot, it cannot avail itself of the saliva 
supplied by the mouth. It should also be borne in mind that a tem- 
perature much above that of the body cracks the enamel of the teeth. 



334 I>IET IN HEALTH AND DISEASE. 

Excessive concentration impairs digestibility. The principal me- 
dium by which nutriment is carried through the absorbent membrane 
of the digestive canal is water. There is no doubt it passes more 
rapidly by endosmosis than anything else. The removal, then, of 
water is an injury to viands ; and drying, salting, over-frying, over- 
roasting, and even over-boiling, renders them less soluble in the 
digestive juices, and so less nutritious. A familiar illustration of this 
may be taken from eggs. Let an egg be lightly boiled, poached in 
water, custarded, or raw, and the stomach even of an invalid can 
bear it ; but let it be baked in a pudding which requires a hot oven, 
or boiled hard, or otherwise submitted to a high temperature for a 
prolonged period, and it becomes a tasteless, leathery substance, 
which can be of no more use in the stomach than so much skin or 
hair. It is obvious, then, that it is mainly in a commercial point of 
view that articles of diet can be called nutritious in proportion to 
their concentration. About this there can be no question; milk 
adulterated from the pump is worth so much less than pure milk, 
and a pound of beef -steak sustains a man longer than a pint of veal- 
broth. 

The attainment of nutritiousness by concentration is of consid- 
erable importance to travelers and in military medicine. There are 
not a few strategists who attribute the success of the Germans in the 
war of 1870 to the easily-carried and easily-prepared food supplied 
to them by the sausage-makers of Berlin. Concentration of viands 
carried to excess, so as to be likely to affect the health, is usually 
made manifest by a diminution in the secretion of urine and its con- 
densed condition ; while, on the other hand, if dilution is needlessly 
great, the action of the kidneys is excessive. Now, the urine of 
young persons is naturally of lower specific gravity — that is, more 
aqueous — than that of adults. If it is found to equal in density the 
excretion of full growth, or if it is observed to be voided but rarely, 
the meals should be made more bulky, or, better still, more frequent, 
so as not to overload the stomach. 

An over-concentrated diet often induces costiveness. This should 
be counteracted by green vegetables and other dilute appetizing 
dishes, and never by purgative drugs. The habit of taking a consid- 
erable quantity and variety of fresh green vegetables has the further 
advantage of preventing that tendency to minor developments of 
scurvy which is not uncommonly found in youths nourished mainly 



DIET FOR BODILY LABOR. 335 

on animal food. A softness or friability of the gums is one of the 
first signs of this. . If the mouth bleeds after the application of a 
tooth-brush, the use of fresh vegetables at every meal should be 
enforced. 

The young are peculiarly liable to be affected by poisons con- 
veyed in fluids. Their sensitive frames absorb quickly, and quickly 
turn to evil account such substances, even when diluted to an extent 
which makes them harmless to adults. The water, therefore, with 
which families, and still more with which schools, are supplied, 
should be carefully subjected to analysis. Wherever a trace of lead 
is found, means should be adopted to remove the source of it ; and 
organic products should have their origin clearly accounted for, and 
all possibility of sewage contamination excluded. These precautions 
are essential, in spite of the grown-up portion of the household hav- 
ing habitually used the water without injury. 

Fresh milk has long had a bad popular reputation as occasionally 
conveying fever, and in some parts of Ireland the peasantry can 
hardly ever be got to take it "raw." This is quite irrespective of 
the state of the cattle which furnish it ; no cases of disease thus com- 
municated have ever been traced home to sick cows. It is probably 
always due either to adulteration with dirty water, or to the vessels 
being washed in that dangerous medium, or to their being exposed 
to air loaded with elements of contagion. 

lip to the period of full development, the daily use of wine should 
be allowed only during illness and the express attendance of a med- 
ical adviser. Its habitual consumption by liealthy children hastens 
forward the crisis of puberty, checks growth, and habituates them to 
the artificial sensations induced by alcohol. 

Diet for Bodily Labor. — It seems certain that the old theory of 
Liebig, which attributed the whole of the force exhibited in muscu- 
lar movements to the oxidation of muscular tissue, is untenable. 
There is not enough of the material oxidized — that is to say, destroyed 
and carried away as urea and other nitrogenous excretions — to gen- 
erate so much force, as measured by the method of Joule. On the 
other hand, Traube goes too far when he would make out that in the 
performance of muscular work the metamorphosis of the organized 
constituents of contractile tissue is not involved, and that non-nitro- 
genous substances alone are consumed. The prolonged feats of 
walking performed by the pedestrian Weston in 1876 vastly increased 



336 I>IET IN HEALTH AND DISEASE. 

the amounts excreted of those elements of the nrine which ai-e de- 
rived from the oxidation of muscle and nerve.^ The urea formed by 
the destructive assimilation of contractile fibre, and the phosphates 
whose main source is nervous tissue, were each nearly doubled dur- 
ing and shortly after the extraordinary strain upon those parts of 
the body. As might be expected, the machinery wears away quicker 
when it is harder worked, and requires to be repaired immediately 
by an enhanced quantity of new material, or it will be worn beyond 
the power of repair. The daily supply, therefore, of digestible nitro- 
genous food — meat par excellence — must be increased whenever the 
muscular exercise is increased. In making the recent extension of 
railways in Sicily, the progress was retarded by the slack work done 
by the Sicilian navvies, compared with that got through by the Eng- 
lish gangs. The former took scarcely any meat, preferring to save 
the wages expended by their comrades in that way. The idea oc- 
curred to the contractor of paying the men partly in money and 
partly in meat ; and the result was a marked increase in the amount 
of work executed, which was brought nearly up to the British aver- 
age. A mixed diet, with an increase in the proportionate quantity 
of meat when extra corporeal exertion is required, is the wholesomest, 
as well as the most economical, for all sorts of manual laborers. 

It is absolutely essential that the fleshy machinery for doing work 
should be continuously replaced by flesh-food as it becomes worn 
out. Nitrogenous aliment, after a few chemical changes, replaces 
the lost muscle which has passed away in the excretions, just as the 
engineer makes ore into steel and renews the corroded boiler-plate 
or thinned piston. Now, as the renewal of the plate or piston is a 
*' stimulus " to the augmented performances of the engine, so meat 
is a " stimulus" to augmented muscular action. Taken in a digesti- 
ble form during exertion, it allows the exertion to be continued 
longer, with greater ease and less consequent exhaustion. Accord- 
ing to the testimony of soldiers experimentally put through forced 
marches of twenty miles a day, with loads of half a hundredweight 
each, "meat extract" bears away the palm from the other reputed 
stimulants commonly compared with it — viz., rum and coffee. "It 
does not put a spirit into you for a few miles only, but has a lasting

effect. If I were ordered for continuous marching, and had my 
choice, I would certainly take the meat extract," said an unpreju- 
diced sergeant to Dr. Parkes, who was the conductor of the experi- 
ments alluded to.^ 

When the continuous repair of the muscular machinery is fully 
secured, the production of heat and force is most readily provided 
for hy vegetable aliment, by reason of the large proportion of carbon 
which it contains. In assigning their physiological functions to the 
several sorts of food, nearly all the business of begetting active force 
should apparently be ascribed to the solid hydrocarbons, starch and 
fat, by their conversion into carbonic acid. It is not necessary to be 
acquainted with every step of the process — which in the body we 
confessedly are not — to appreciate the argument. It is clearly im- 
portant that these elements of diet should be furnished in sufficient 
quantity, and in a digestible form. In additions to diet made in 
consequence of additional bodily work, not only should the stimulus 
of animal food be attended to, but the bulk of starch and fat in the 
rations should be augmented even in larger proportion, for these ali- 
ments are the most direct contributors of force.^

3 This is well illustrated by a remarkable feat performed on the Great Western Kailway 
In the summer of 1872. It was necessary to shift the rails from the broad to the narrow 
gauge on upward of 500 miles of permanent way within a fortnight. The task was enor- 
mous, for the Great Western is one of the few English lines whose rails are held down by 
bolts screwed into nuts. All these had to be unscrewed, and replaced after removing the 
heavy rail two feet About 3,000 men were employed, working double time, sometimes 
from 4 in the morning till 9 at night ; and, without one being sick or drunk, they accom- 
plished the work in the prescribed time. The scheme for generating muscular power was 
this : The men were hutted along the line, so as not to waste their strength by coming and 
going, and they brought with them bacon, bread, cheese, cocoa, etc., to provide their usual 
meals at usual times. But they had no boer, nor alcohol in any form. A pound and a half 
of oatmeal and half a pound of sugar was allowed extra to each man daily, and for every 
gang of twenty-one a cook was provided. The first thing done ia the morning was to 
breakfast ; and then the cook and his caldron started along the line till water was found 
convenient ; a fireplace of stones was built, and the pot boiled. Oatmeal was then sprin- 
kled into it with sugar, and thoroughly well boiled till thin gruel was made. As soon as 
the " shout for drink " was heard, buckets were filled and carried round, with small pan- 
nikins to convey the liquid to the panting mouths. The men liked it exceedingly, and 
learned by experience the importance of having it well cooked. 

The incident may remind the reader of classical medicine of Hippocrates, who considers 
the culinary preparation of oatmeal ptisan so important, that, in a short treatise "On the 
Treatment of Acute Disease," he devotes to it the only cookery recipe he has inserted in 
his works. He describes how it is to be boiled till it can swell no longer (so that it may

DIET IN HEALTH AND DISEASE. 



Training for athletic sports is based on the principles above 
enunciated. The usual time allotted to it is six weeks, and the ob- 
jects to be attained in this period may be described as — 

1. The removal of superfluous fat and water. 

2. The increase of contractile power in the muscles. 
8. Increased endurance. 

4. " Wind," that is to say, a power of breathing and circulating 
the blood steadily, in spite of exertion. 

The first is aimed at by considerably adding to the daily amount 
of nitrogenous and by diminishing farinaceous and liquid food, and 
providing that it should be so consumed as to be fully digested. 
The second and third are secured by gradually increasing the de- 
mands made upon the muscles, till they have learned to exert at 
will all the powers of which they are capable, and for as long a 
period as the natural structure of the individual frame permits. 
" Wind " is improved by choosing as part of the training an exercise 
such as running, which can be sustained only when the respiratory 
and circulating organs do their duty fairly. 

As an example, the Oxford system of training for the summer 
boat-races may be cited. It may be considered a typical regimen 
for fully developing a young man's corporeal powers to fulfill the de- 
mands of an extraordinary exertion — a standard which may be mod- 
ified according to the circumstances for which the training is re- 
quired. It is as follows :

with our advanced physiologists in the opinion that overstrained muscular effort produces 
the same effect as continued fever (es irvpeTov Ka6i<na.ra.i ju.a»cp6Tepov), its chief dangers 
lying in rise of temperature and arrested cutaneous action, and that its true antagonist is 
nutriment capable of rapid absorption, dissolved in that most essential nutriment, water.

The Cambridge system differs very slightly, and in neither is any . 
exaggerated severity of discipline enforced, while some latitude is 
permitted to peculiarities and a wish for variety, and plenty of 
time is left for business and social intercourse. Other plans are 
objectionable, from involving, without any corresponding advantage, 
a complete departure from the usual habits of the educated classes. 
For instance, according to Clasper, dinner is to be at noon, with 
only a light tea afterward, and no supper. Then a country walk 
of four or five miles is to be taken before breakfast, and two hours' 
row afterward, and another hard row between dinner and tea.* 
*' Stonehenge," again, requires the time between breakfast and 
dinner to be spent entirely on billiards, skittles, quoits, rowing, 
and running, in spite of another hour's row being prescribed at 
6 p. M. He also requires the aspirant for athletic honors to sleep 
between ten and eleven hours." Only professionals will carry out 
such rules, and even they do not either benefit their health or 
lengthen their lives by the sacrifice ; for it is notorious that " over- 
training" leads to a condition of system in which the sufferers de- 
scribe themselves as " fallen to pieces." The most peculiar symptom 
is a sudden loss of voluntary power after exertion. It is sometimes 
called " fainting," but there is no loss of sense, and it is quickly re- 
lieved by liquid food. It is to the pathologist a timely warning of 
that consequence of overstrained muscle which constitutes paralysis 
scriptorum, turner's palsy, and blacksmith's palsy, and which results 
in fatty degeneration of the red muscular fibre. To get and to keep 
its health, a muscle needs a constant alternation of active contraction 
and rest, and an enforced protraction of either one or the other leads 
to the loss of vital properties. The limbs of an Indian fakir, volun- 
tarily held in a strained posture, or those of a bed-ridden invalid, are

equally apt to become useless. Over-trained persons are also liable 
to a languor and apparent weakness, which is found, on examination, 
to depend on an excessive secretion of urea by the kidneys. 

Such are not the results, however, of the training adopted' at the 
universities, by which it would appear that the constitution is 
strengthened, the intellect sharpened, and life lengthened. Dr. John 
Morgan ("University Oars," 1873) has collected statistics of the sub- 
sequent health of those who have rowed in the university races since 
1829, and he finds that, whereas at twenty years of age, according to 
Farr's life tables, average expectation of survival is forty years, for 
these oarsmen it is forty-two years. Moreover, in the cases of death, 
inquiry into its causes exhibits evidence of good constitutions rather 
than the contrary, the causes consisting largely of fevers and acci- 
dents, to which the vigorous and active are more exposed than the 
sick. And it is not at the expense of the mind that the body is cul- 
tivated, for this roll of athletes is adorned with the names of bishops, 
poets, queen's counsel, etc. 

Training greatly increases the vital capacity of the chest, so that 
much more air can be blown in and out of the lungs, and with greater 
force, than previously. And this vital capacity endures longer than 
the other improvements. It is evidence of the permanent elasticity 
of the pulmonary tissue, and an efficient protection against asthma, 
emphysema, and other degenerations of the organ of breathing. 

Indigestion, sleeplessness, nervous indecision, palpitation of heart, 
and irregularity of bowels, disappear under training; but if they 
exist, the regimen should be entered on with more than usual caution. 

An important modification of training is that which contemplates 
the reduction of corpulence which has increased to the extent 
of interfering with comfort and preventing active exercise. If an 
exhausting amount of muscular efi*ort is enforced, the digestion of 
meat is interfered with, while at the same time there still goes on 
the absorption of such fat as is unavoidably present in the victuals, 
so that the muscles and nerves lose strength, while the adipose tissue 
grows. Besides this, if by violent means the weight is worked down, 
then, to keep it down, those violent means must be persisted in; 
and if they be neglected for more interesting occupations, the burden 
rapidly increases to a greater degree than ever. Many uncomfortably 
obese persons are very active in mind and body, and could not add 
to their muscular exercise without risk of harm. 



THE REDUCTIOX OF COEPULENCE. 341 

Regimen, tlien, is more essentially important to them than to 
other trainers, and they will probably be more induced to attend to 
it if they understand the principles on which it is based. This is 
simply to exclude from the bill of fare all those articles which con- 
tain fat, or which, by the chemical actions of the digestive viscera, 
may be converted into fat. 

For the reduction of corpulence, the following rules may be ob- 
served for a three weeks' course : 

Eise at 7, rub the body w^ell with horse-hair gloves, have a cold 
bath, and take a short turn in the open air. Breakfast (alone) at 8 
or 8.30, on the lean of beef or mutton (cutting off the fat and skin), 
dry toast, biscuit or oat-cake, a tumbler of claret and water, or tea 
without milk or sugar, or made in the Russian way, with a slice of 
lemon. Lunch at 1 on bread or biscuit, Dutch cheese, salad, water- 
cresses or roasted apples, hung beef or anchovies, or red-herring, or 
olives, and similar relishes. After eating, drink claret and water, or 
unsweetened lemonade, or plain water, in moderation. Dine at any 
convenient hour. Avoid soup, fish, or pastry, but eat plain meat of 
any sort except pork, rejecting the fat and skin. Spinach, haricots, 
or any other green vegetable, may be taken, but no potatoes, made 
dishes, or sweets. A jelly, or a lemon- water-ice, or a roast apple, 
must suffice in their place. Take claret and water at dinner, and one 
glass of sherry or Madeira afterward. 

Between meals, as a rule, exercise must always be taken to the 
extent of inducing perspiration. Running, when practicable, is the 
best form in which to take it. 

Seven or eight pounds is as much as it is prudent to lose during 
the three weeks. If this loss is arrived at sooner, or indeed later, 
the severe parts of the treatment may be gradually omitted ; but 
it is strongly recommended to modify the general habits in accord- 
ance with the principle of taking as small a quantity as possible of 
fat and sugar, or of substances which form fat and sugar, and sus- 
taining the respiratory function. By this means the weight may be 
gradually reduced for a few months with safety. 

Small quantities of dilute alcoholic liquids taken with meds 
slightly increase the activity of the renewal of the nitrogenous tissues, 
mainly muscle ; that is to say, there is a more rapid reconstruction 
of those parts, as is shown by the augmented formation of urea and 
the sharpened appetite. Life is fuller and more complete, old flesh 



842 I^IET IN EEALTH AND DISEASE. 

is removed, and food appropriated as new flesh, somewhat more 
quickly than when no alcohol is ingested. There appears to be a 
temporary rise in the digestive powers of the stomach, which is prob- 
ably the initiative act. The nerve-functions are blunted, and a less- 
ened excretion of phosphorus exhibits a temporary check in the 
wear and renewal of the nerve-tissue. The " vital capacity " of the 
lungs, as indicated by the spirometer, is reduced, showing a dimin- 
ished oxidation of the blood. 

The effect on a healthy man of taking with a meal such a quan- 
tity of fermented liquor as puts him at ease with himself and the 
world around, without untoward exhilaration, is to arrest the wear of 
the nervous system, especially that part employed in emotion and 
sensation. Just as often, then, as the zest for food is raised to its 
normal standard by a little wine or beer with a meal, the moderate 
consumer is as much really better as he feels the better for it. 
Where the food is as keenly enjoyed without it, the consumption of 
a stimulant is useless. But alcohol is not a source of force, and its 
direct action is an arrest of vitality. 

Diet for Mental WorTc. — An expression of Btiohner's — "No think- 
ing without phosphorus " ^ — has gained an unhappy notoriety. 
Strictly speaking, it is a groundless assumption, for we cannot say 
that intellectual being may not exist joined to any form of matter, or 
quite independent of matter. We certainly do not know enough of 
the subject to lay down such a negative statement. And if it be held 
to mean that the amount of phosphorus passing through the body 
bears a proportion to the intensity of thought, it is simply a mis- 
statement. A captive lion, tiger, leopard, or hare assimilates and 
parts with a greater amount of phosphorus than a hard-thinking 
man, while a beaver, noted for its powers of contrivance, excretes 
so little phosphorus that chemical analysis cannot find it in the 
excreta. All that the physiologist is justified in asserting is that, for 
the mind to energize in a living body, that body must be kept \Wm^ 
up to a certain standard, and that for the continuous renewal of life 
a supply of phosphatic salts is required. The same may be said with 
equal justice of water, fat, nitrogen, chloride of sodium, oxygen, etc. 
The phosphates are wanted indeed, but wanted by pinches, whereas 
water is required by pailfuls. A few days without water, or a few 

1 " Ohne Phosphor kein Gedanke," " Kraft und StoflE," section 122. 



DIET FOR MENTAL WORK. 343 

minutes without oxygen, will terminate the train of consciousness. 
The practical points taught us by physiology are that, for the integ- 
rity of thought, integrity of the nervous tissue is requisite ; and for 
the integrity of the nervous tissue, a due quantity of such food as 
contains digestible phosphatic salts. 

The most perfect regimen for the healthy exercise of thought is 
such as would be advised for a growing boy — viz., frequent small 
supplies of easily-soluble mixed food, so as to furnish the greatest 
quantity of nutriment without overloading the stomach, or running 
the risk of generating morbid half-assimilated products. For it is 
essential to the intellectual direction of the nervous system that it 
should not be oppressed by physic^ impediments. The presence in 
the stomach or blood of imperfectly assimilated nutriment impedes 
its functions in close proportion to their amount, so that not only 
the constituents, but the mode of administering food, must come into 
the calculation. '•'■ Repletus 'center non studet Ubenter^^ is an old 
proverb, the application of which saves many a brain and many a 
stomach from being worked against the grain. Rest from brain- 
work for twenty minutes before meals, entire abstinence from it 
during meals, and rest again till the weight has passed from the 
stomach, are essential to the reconcilement of psychical exertion 
with bodily health. 

The physiology of the action of alcohol has a very important 
bearing on the physical management of the mental functions. Alco- 
hol has the power of curbing, arresting, and suspending all the man- 
ifestations of the nervous system, so that we feel its influence on our 
thoughts sooner than on any other part of the system. Sometimes 
it brings them more completely under our command, controls and 
steadies them; more often it confuses or disconnects them, and 
then breaks off our power over them altogether. When a man has 
tired himself by intellectual exertion, a moderate quantity of alco- 
holic stimulant taken with food acts as an anaesthetic, stays the wear 
of the system which is going on, and allows the nerve-force to be 
turned to the due digestion of the meal. But it must be followed by 
rest from toil, and is in essence a part of the same treatment which 
includes rest — it is an artificial rest. To continue to labor, and at 
the same time to take an anaesthetic, is a physiological inconsistency. 
The drug merely blunts the useful feeling of weariness, and prevents 
it from acting as a warning. There is no habit more fatal to a lit- 
16 



344r I>IET IN HEALTH AND DISEASE. 

erary man than that of taking stimulants between meals ; the vital 
powers go on wearing out more and more, without their cry for help 
being perceived, and in the end break down irrevocably. 

As to quantity, the appetite for solid food ia the safest guide. If 
a better dinner or supper is eaten when it is accompanied by a cer- 
tain amount of fermented liquor, that is the amount most suitable ; 
if a worse, then an excess is committed, however little be taken. 

The aim of the diet should be (to quote the words of John Mil- 
ton) "to preserve the body's health and hardness, to render light- 
some, clear, and not lumpish obedience to the mind, to the cause of 
religion and our country's liberty, when it shall require from hearts 
in sound bodies to stand and cover their stations." 

It is especially when the mind of genius is overshadowed by the 
dark clouds of threatened insanity, of hypochondriasis, or of hysteria, 
that a rational mode of life preserves it. Nothing but daily exercise, 
temperate meals, and a punctual observance of regular hours of rest 
and study, could have kept burning the flickering reason in poor 
Cowper. 

As regards the proper quantity of alcohol that may be used, the 
two following questions naturally occur : How is a man to know 
when he has had enough ? and what are the signs of too much ? The 
ancients used to wear dark-red or purple engraved gems, which they 
considered preservatives against excess, and called them afiedvaroi — 
"sober-stones," " amethysts." The name is now limited to the vio- 
let rock-crystal, but in early times it was applied to several other 
stones, cut in intaglio, and worn on the fingers at festive gatherings. 
So long as the wearer could decipher the minute works of art they 
bore, he had not reached excess. A more delicate test still is the. 
appreciation of temperature by the skin ; if a draught does not chill, 
if a hot room fails to produce the usual discomfort, the wise man 
knows he has exceeded and must stop at once. In short, the safest 
rule is that, when there is a consciousness of any psychical effect at 
all beyond that of satisfaction at the relief of bodily weariness — such 
a satisfaction as is felt on taking a good meal by a vigorous person — 
then the limits of moderation have been attained. On ordinary 
occasions of daily life, and " for the stomach's sake," no more 
should be taken. Each fresh drop is a step downward to the evil 
results of alcohol. But to the practiser of daily temperance, festive 
occasions are safe and may be beneficial. A man may, from time to 



DIET OF MOTHERS. 345 

time, keep up withont harm the above-mentioned sense of satisfac- 
tion by good and digestible wine in good company, without fear of 
getting drunk or failure of health, if he makes it a law to himself to 
stop as soon as he experiences any hurry of ideas or indistinctness of 
the senses. 

Diet of Mothers. — During pregnancy as much care should be taken 
not to get too fat as is taken by an athlete training for a race. The 
rules for modified training explained above will afford hints on the 
subject, but it is not desirable to carry the process so far. 

There is a temptation at this time to increase the usual allowance 
of stimulant; alcohol is taken between meals to overcome the nausea 
and depression incident to the state of body. And by this mistaken 
expedient the nausea gradually becomes dyspeptic vomiting. On 
leaving it off, the sickness ceases. A mother should also remember 
that nearly all the alcohol she consumes mixes with her blood, which 
now is one with the blood of the foetus. 

During lactation the most suitable drink for a mother is cow's 
milk, fresh and unskimmed. If it turns sour on the stomach, lime- 
water mixed with it not only corrects the acescence, but also supplies 
a valuable aid to the growing bones of the infant. In her solid diet- 
ary, also, milk may be fairly taken as the type of a due admixture of 
alimentary principles, because it is not individual growth or the pro- 
duction of muscular force, but the secretion of milk, that is the ob- 
ject of the selection of diet. 

Supposing the full diet to consist of three pounds of solid food, 
that will require six pints extra of uncombined aqueous fluid to make 
it as fluid as milk ; and, to combine the nitrogenous and carbonaceous 
constituents in due proportion, the three pounds of solid food should 
consist of 

\A\ ounces of meat. 
13 ounces of fat, butter, and sugar. 
20 ounces of farinaceous food and vegetables. 
i ounce of salt, lime, etc. 

At first, from the exhaustion consequent on childbed, from the 
want of exercise and of fresh air, the appetite turns against meat. 
Let then milk, especially boiled milk, with arrow-root or the like, 
chicken-broth, or egg-custards, fill up the deficiency. 

Any increase in the habitual allowance of alcohol is as unfitting 
to this period of life as during pregnancy. 



346 DIET IN HEALTH AND DISEASE. 

Diet of Old Age. — It is a remark extant from the rough thnes, 
when famine was more frequent than now, that the older a human 
being is the better deficiency of food is borne. Old men suffer least 
from abstinence,^ and benefit therefore most from temperance in eat- 
ing. Everybody who has passed the age of fifty, or thereabouts, with 
a fairly unimpaired constitution, will act wisely in diminishing his 
daily quantity of solid food. There is less demand for the materials 
of growth, and consequently animal food should bear a smaller pro- 
portion than heretofore to vegetable, and it is mainly in that ingredi- 
ent of the diet that reduction should be eflfected. Neglect of this 
rule in declining years is often punished by gout — a disease attribu- 
table to excess of nitrogenous aliment, and for this reason common 
to elderly men. 

In the autumn of life, the advantages derived from fermented 
liquor are more advantageous, and the injuries it can inflict less in- 
jurious, to the body than in youth. The effect of alcohol is to check 
the activity of destructive assimilation, to arrest that rapid flux of 
the substance of the frame which, in healthy youth, can hardly be 
excessive, but which, in old age, exhausts the vital force. Loss of 
appetite is a frequent and a serious symptom in old age. It usually 
arises from deficient formation of gastric juice, which, in common 
with other secretions, diminishes with years. It is best treated phys- 
iologically rather than by drugs. 

Diet in SicJcness.—Jn all that has gone before, health has been pre- 
supposed. The modifications necessitated by sickness are of three 
kinds: 1. The avoidance of such articles of consumption as would 
increase the disease under the special circumstances, although ordi- 
narily wholesome ; 2. The maintenance of the functions or parts of 
the frame which remain normal ; 3. The administration, for a special 
curative purpose, of pecuHar food which would not be recommended 
for general use. 

In all fevers which are classed together as being apparently due to 
a poison multiplying itself in the blood, the art of diet consists in 
giving an almost continuous supply of liquid nutriment, holding very 
soluble aliments in a dilute form. There is nothing so digestible as 
water, and we take advantage of this high digestibility to get what- 
ever it can dissolve digested along with it. For the first three or 

* Hippocrates, Aphorism xiii. 



DIET IN FEVER. 347 

even four days, patients, previously strong, should have only farina- 
ceous food, well boiled and cooled to the temperature of the body. 
Evidence has been already quoted of the power which oatmeal-gruel 
possesses of sustaining force under the trying circumstances of ex- 
cessive toil. Now, fever closely resembles muscular effort in its arrest 
of the digestive functions, at the same moment that it makes an ur- 
gent demand for nutriment. With ultra-Egyptian rigor, while straw 
is withheld, "the tale of the bricks is doubled," and we know by the 
quantity of urea and phosphates in the urine, and by the foecal excre- 
tion, that the muscles and nerves of the bed-ridden sufferer are melt- 
ing away as fast as if he were scaling the Alps with nothing to eat. 
It is quite reasonable to transfer the experiences derived from health 
to sickness, and to feel satisfied that we are not wasting precious op- 
portunities when we are giving fever-patients such a time-honored 
diet as oatmeal-gruel, care being taken that it is thoroughly well 
boiled. After three days, the tissues are beginning to suffer, and it 
is advisable to add chicken-broth, meat- jelly, and strong soup. Let 
that be supplied which the emaciation shows to be passing away — 
nitrogenous tissue. 

The administration of alcohol is to be regulated partly by the 
temperature and partly by the condition of the nervous system. Usu- 
ally, if the heat of the blood (as taken at the axilla) is above 103°, 
and always if it is above 105°, there is a necessity for it. Again, if 
there is great prostration of strength, or tremor of the hands, or 
quivering in the voice and respiration, if there is low muttering de- 
lirium when the patient is left quiet, it is required. 

Green-sicMess, or anaemia, is characterized by the rapid disappear- 
ance of the red particles which float in the blood. To what a strange 
extent this goes may be seen by looking at the insides of the lips, 
which naturally hold such a quantity of the fluid as to be quite scar- 
let, but which now are pale like those of a corpse. It is calculated 
that the loss of material in marked cases of green-sickness may 
amount to three pounds of this important constituent of the blood.* 
Yet it is capable of complete renewal by diet. If by dint of reme- 
dies, notably iron, the appetite can be so regulated as to enjoy meat 
in excess of the immediate wants of the body, that meat is converted 
into hssmatine, and the healthy hue returns to the cheeks as quickly

as it left it. Wine is useful at meals on account of the stimulus 
it gives to the appetite; it is injurious between meals by spoil- 
ing it. 

^ Acute rheumatism and acute gout are best treated on an opposite 
principle. A nutrient nitrogenous diet, which the patient assimilates 
only too readily, retards recovery, and will even bring on a relapse 
during convalescence. If meat in any form, solid or liquid, be eaten, 
it seems to turn to acid, which is already in excess in the blood. The 
power of fully converting it into living flesh is wanting; and, until 
this power is regained, a semi-conversion into an oi-ganic acid takes 
place. The redder and more muscular the meat is, the more it dis- 



Ghronic gout is indubitably due to good cheer indulged in either 
by the sufferer or his ancestors. When a man, day after day, swal- 
lows more nitrogenous food than is wanted for the repair of his tis- 
sues, the following results may be expected, with variations depend- 
ent upon his original constitution : If the digestive solvents are weak 
and scanty, the excess passes through the canal in an undigested 
state, and is partially decomposed there. Thereon ensue all sorts of 
abdominal derangements, which, however, have the advantage of 
getting rid of the offending matters. If, on the other hand, the 
stomach secretes vigorously on being stimulated, then, indeed, the 
excess is digested and absorbed, and is subject to the future changes 
consequent on assimilation. An active out-of-door life neutralizes 
this in some measure by augmenting oxidation ; much of the albumen 
goes to form glycogen, and acts as a fuel for the maintenance of mus- 
cular force. The balance is wasted in an unexplained way, and does 
not necessarily injure a hardy frame. The violent muscular exertion 
and high training needful for oxidation being inconsistent with the 
habits of intellectual society, a man in the prime of life who puts too 
much meat into a good stomach habitually retains in his blood an ex- 
cess of uric acid, into which the nitrogenous waste converts itself. 
Fric acid in the blood has been distinctly traced as the essence of 
gout. Perhaps this imaginary first offender develops the full con- 
sequences; and that is the best thing that can happen, inducing 
greater carefulness in future. 

These views can suggest but one line of preventive treatment: 
The children of gouty families should be brought up to a life of strict 
abstemiousness and muscular activity. From the earliest years vege- 



REGIMEN IN GOUTY CONDITIONS. 349 

tables and "meagre" soups should form a considerable portion of 
their dietary. 

Gouty adults require meat but once in twenty-four hours. The 
bill of fare should be varied from day to day, but as simple as pos- 
sible at each meal. Rich sauces are to be eschewed, and a lemon, an 
infusion of herbs and pepper, bread-sauce, or a puree of vegetables, 
adopted in their place. Sugar, at the end of meals, generates an ex- 
cess of organic acid, and it is to be avoided. If cheese is eaten, it 
should be new, and is best toasted and creamed. 

Dilute alkaline waters containing soda, such as ApoUinaris or the 
weaker Vichy, are a rational drink during meals ; but it is probably 
best to keep to pure water. Those who live idle lives require no al- 
cohol, and it should not be an habitual accompaniment to meals. 

Red gravel is evidence of a constitution so closely allied to gout, 
that nothing need be said further about its appropriate regimen. 

In BrighVs disease of the kidneys, in contracted liver^ and, in 
short, in all degenerative lesions, alcohol has a baneful influence. Its 
action upon the tissues is directly the same as theirs. Moreover, if 
we agree with its latest expositor, Dr. Sibson, that Bright's disease 
is closely associated with increased arterial tension, alcohol (whose 
effect is also to increase tension) must be peculiarly poisonous. * 

For the cure of these diseases, independent of the nutrition of the 
rest of the body, a milk diet has been proposed, and it seems to offer 
a fair prospect, if the patients can be persuaded to persist in it. How 
safely a milk diet may be adopted in middle life is shown by the ex- 
ample of Dr. Cheyne, a Bath physician of the last century, who, at 
about fifty-five, restricted himself entirely to milk and biscuits, and 
yet was able to fulfill the duties of his laborious profession. He took 
at first of the former six pints, of the latter twelve ounces; but he 
shortly diminished the quantity to half, and, after sixteen years' ex- 
perience, found it fully sufficient, and indeed capable of further re- 
duction in quantity.^ 

WeaJc and slow digestion is a condition which enforces an especial 
care for meat and drink. The cause of the imperfection lies in a 
deficiency in the supply of nerve-power to the stomach, so that it 
both secretes its solvent fluid and also rotates its contents too slowly;

M.D.,1742.

and the more it is loaded the slower it goes. Of the medicinal means 
of curing such a state, this is not the place to speak ; but none of 
them will avail without the aid of a rational dietary. Time must be 
given to the oppressed organ wherein to empty itself of every com- 
plete meal, and such a period of rest given as will allow of the re- 
covery of force ; or, if the meals are frequent, they must be very 
sparing. The observations of Busch (Virchow's "Archiv," xiv.) 
show that a period of five hours elapses in the healthy subject be- 
fore a fully filled stomach can empty itself, and in the dyspeptic the 
process is still longer. Whenever, therefore, the organ is laaded as 
healthy people rightly load it, a man should allow at lea&t seven or 
eight hours to elapse before sitting down to another meal, and he 
must never eat till the need for food is announced by appetite. Per- 
haps a more generally applicable and easier-obeyed law is not to 
make full meals at all, but to stop short at the feehng of repletion, 
and, when that has gone ofi", again to take in the supply allowed by 
circumstances. Three moderate meals are usually sufBcient to keep 
up the strength. 

Meat should be once cooked. Mutton, feathered fowl, venison, 
lamb, and beef are digestible in the order they here are placed in. 
The more difiicult dishes should have the longest time allowed ta 
them. Of the farinaceous articles of diet, bread and biscuits are 
the most easily penetrated by the gastric juices, and all their prep- 
arations are safe. The best bread is the " aerated," which is free 
from decomposing yeast. Macaroni is good if soaked till quite ma- 
cerated. Pastry is difiicult of solution. Vegetables are very neces- 
sary; cauliflowers, Jerusalem artichokes, beet-root, French beans, 
soft peas, stewed celery, turnip-tops, spinach, are the most readily 
disposed of. 

When the usual mixture of meat and vegetables is found to in- 
duce flatulence, it is a good expedient to eat vegetables only at one 
meal and meat and bread only at another. The principle on which 
this plan is based is that starchy food is dissolved mainly by the al- 
kaline saliva, whereas meat is dissolved by the acid gastric juice. 
In a vigorous person both are copious enough to render immaterial 
their mutual neutralization ; but when they are scanty, their separate 
employment is a physiological economy. 

Consumption is a disease whose treatment is almost wholly die- 
tetic. The children of a mother whose pedigree exhibits proof of a

consumptive tendency may with propriety be put to a healthy wet- 
nurse immediately on birth, and, on being weaned, be fed from a 
Channel Island cow. The milk should be boiled and then cooled 
down to tepidity. A small teaspoonful of " saccharated solution of 
lime " may be advantageously added to each quart of milk when the 
coming teeth require the elements of their nutrition to be added to 
the diet. The rules already given for the healthy management of 
the young should be adhered to with unusual strictness, and any 
departure from them should be made only to provide for some pecul- 
iar necessity of the case according to medical advice. 

In cases of consumption it is difficult to say that drugs are use- 
less, but certainly those that come nearest to aliments have most 
evidence in their favor, such as iron, cod-liver oil, and the phos- 
phates of lime. Tiieir effect on th^ appetite must be sedulously 
watched, and the end must not be sacrificed to the means ; that is 
to say, if they spoil the appetite, they must be left off. The reason 
for administering oil is to afford an easily assimilated basis of re- 
newed organic growth, to take the place of the abnormal tendency 
to form tubercular matter. If anything prevents its easy assimila- 
tion it is obviously useless. The use of climate in the treatment of 
phthisis may be tested by its dietetic action ; if it improves the ap- 
petite it is doing good ; if it injures the appetite it is doing harm. 

In chronic jaundice the function of the liver is best restored by 
the free use of green vegetables at all meals. 

Diabetes^ when it has once assumed a chronic form, is never 
really cured, but life may be much prolonged by the employment of 
a diet from which sugar and starch are excluded as far as practi- 
cable, and the patient nourished on animal food. The best fare for 
diabetic patients is that given by Prof. Bouchardat in his work " Du 
Diabete sucr6e," Paris, 1852. 

In functional nervous diseases^ such as hysteria and hypochon- 
driasis, the appetite, muscular elasticity, and mental powers will 
often be observed to be deficient in the early part of the day, and to 
recover their tone in the evening. At this latter time, therefore, it 
is advisable to make the principal meal. 

Scurvy is a notable example of a disease of which, more than 
any other, the prevention depends on the adoption of a suitable 
diet. Its symptoms so far resemble those of general starvation that, 
from the earliest time of its appearance in history, it has been sus- 



352 DIET IN HEALTH AND DISEASE. 

pected that it is due to a dietary defective in some necessary ingre- 
dient ; and practical observation soon showed that this was fresh 
vegetables. It was found on every long voyage that the crew suffered 
from scurvy in proportion to the length of time they were restricted 
to dry food, and that they recovered rapidly as soon as they got 
access to a supply of succulent plants. This requisite for health is 
obviously the most difficult of all things to procure aboard ship, and 
eiforts were made to find a substitute capable of marine transport. 
From the time of Hawkins ^ (1593) downward the opinion has been 
expressed, by all the most intelligent travelers, that a substitute is 
to be found in the juice of fruits of the orange tribe, such as oranges, 
lemons, etc. But in its natural state this is expensive and trouble- 
some to carry, so that skippers and owners for a couple of centu- 
ries found it expedient to be skeptical. The pictures of scurvy as it 
appeared during the eighteenth century are horrible in the extreme. 
But the statute of 1795, passed through the exertions of Captain 
Cook and Sir Gilbert Blane, has enforced the carrying of lime-juice. 
This invaluable preventive has shown its influence all the more de- 
cidedly by the disease still appearing occasionally under strong pro- 
moting circumstances, and to a certain extent in spite of the anti- 
dote ; but it is so modified as to be usually more of the nature of a 
warning or demonstration than of a serious invasion. Some, indeed, 
have questioned and even denied altogether the blessings derived 
from the enforced use of lime-juice. But they make a very scanty 
show wh*en weighed with those whom they undertake to oppose; 
and it is superfluous here to enter into the arguments and results of 
observation constituting the ponderous " Report of the Committee 
appointed by the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to inquire 
into the Causes of the Outbreak of Scurvy in the Eecent Arctic Ex- 
pedition, etc., and presented to both Houses of Parliament, May 7, 
1877," which seems to settle forever the preventive powers against 
scurvy of the use of lime-juice. 

The committee alluded to was appointed in consequence of one 
of those exceptional outbreaks of scurvy induced by exceptional cir- 
cumstances. The ships sent on the exploring expedition of 1875 
were amply provided with lime-juice, and with printed expositions 
of its value. During the voyage out and in the long inaction of the

INFLUENCE OF FOOD IN SCURVY. 353 

winter, the men's health was so well preserved by general attention 
to hygiene that no cases of even mild scurvy were detected ; the 
pallor and languor and depression of spirits of some among the 
sailors were attributed to the want of sunlight for 142 days, and it 
was expected that a few days' sledge traveling in the open air would 
reinvigorate them. There was plenty of lime-juice aboard ; but it 
seems that it is not the custom to add to the weight of provisions 
which polar sledging-parties have to propel, by including the pre- 
servative among them. Sir George Nares, the commander of the 
expedition, cites the names of 10 admirals, 10 doctors, and 15' cap- 
tains, who have conducted land explorations in this fashion without 
it ; and they returned unscathed to any serious extent. But on this 
recent occasion the crews seem to have been peculiarly predisposed to 
illnesses of scorbutic nature by the more than ordinary scarcity of fresh 
meat in their dietary, arising out of the deficiency of game in the 
extremely high latitude where they wintered. With few exceptions 
the whole of the crews of the Alert and the Discovery were em- 
ployed in sledging, and the consequence was, that of the 122 officers 
and men 59 were more or less incapacitated by scurvy, and four died. 

The real reason for not carrying lime-juice in such expeditions is 
its cumbersomeness. Including bottles, though in truth they are 
not wanted in a hard frost, it may be said that one pound a week for 
each man would have to be added to the baggage * — a serious item, 
no doubt. And with a view of remedying the inconvenience, medi- 
cal men have long sought to discover to what constituent of the com- 
plicated mixture afforded by Nature it is that it owes its efficacy. In 
a contribution to the Medico- Chirurgical Review for 1848, Dr. Parkes 
examined exhaustively the evidence concerning the various deficien- 
cies in ship-food as compared with fresh food, which might be filled 
up by one or other of the components of lime-juice ; and by exclu- 
sion he is led to the conclusion that the cause of scurvy is to be 
found in deficiency of salts whose acids form carbonates in the sys- 
tem, viz., citric, tartaric, acetic, lactic, and malic acids. 

Though not so good as when in their natural form, because less 
digestible and pleasant, yet a supply of citrates, tartrates, lactates, 
and malates of potash might be packed in small bulk, and, under 

* In merchant-ships lime-juice is used during polar service in a ration of an onnoe 
daily. See " Report " above cited. But the opinions of the officers examined seem to 
agree that the quantity is not sufficient, and adyiae half as much again, or more. 



354: DIET IN HEALTH AND DISEASE. 

cjircumstances where weight is of importance, might take the place 
of lime-juice. Or bolo-lozenges might be made of lime-juice freed 
from its aqueous portion and preserved with sugar. Three or four 
of these a day might be easily swallowed without stopping work. 

Before leaving the subject of maritime scurvy, it may be sug- 
gested how useful it would be if those who sail in desolate regions 
were to carry seeds of antiscorbutic vegetables, which, strewed broad- 
cast in uninhabited places, would form a flora capable of saving the 
lives of many a wrecked or weather-bound crew. 

Scurvy, as landsmen see it in time of peace, amounts to little 
more than ansemia, with a softening and bleeding condition of the 
gums ; but it indicates the use of exactly the same preventives and 
remedies as the more severe complaint. 

Starvation is a disease which it is a platitude to say may be pre- 
vented by diet ; nevertheless there are connected with it a few pecul- 
iarities of scientific and practical interest which may not be unwor- 
thy of notice. "Inedia," as it is called in the nomenclature of 
diseases by the London College of Physicians, is of two kinds, aris- 
ing from want of food and from want of water. 

When entirely deprived of nutriment the human body is capable 
of supporting life under ordinary circumstances for little more than 
a week. In the spring of 1869 this was tried on the person of a 
*' fasting girl " in South Wales. The parents made a show of their 
child, decking her out like a bride on a bed,, and asserting that she 
had eaten no food f6r two years. Some reckless enthusiasts for 
truth set four trustworthy hospital nurses to watch her ; th^ Celtic 
obstinacy of the parents was roused, and in defense of their impost- 
ure they allowed death to take place in eight days. Their trial and 
conviction for manslaughter may be found in the daily periodicals of 
the date; but, strange to say, the experimental physiologists and 
nurses escaped scot-free. There is no doubt that in this instance the 
unnatural quietude, the grave-like silence, and the dim religious 
light in which the victim was kept, contributed to defer death. 

One thing which remarkably prolongs life is a supply of water. 
Dogs furnished with as much as they wished to drink were found 
by M. Chossat (" Sur I'Inanition," Paris, 1843) to live three times a& 
long as those who were deprived of solids and liquids at the same 
time. Even wetting the skin with sea- water has been found useful 
by shipwrecked sailors. Four men and a boy of fourteen, who got

shut in Tynewydd mine, near Forth, in South Wales, in the winter 
of 1876-77, for ten days without food, were not only alive when 
released, hut several of them were ahle to walk, and all subsequently 
recovered. The thorough saturation of the narrow space with aque- 
ous vapor, and the presence of drain- water in the cutting, were 
probably their chief preservatives, assisted by the high, even tem- 
perature always found in the deeper headings of coal-mines, and by 
the enormous compression of the confined air. This, doubtless, pre- 
vented evaporation, and retarded vital processes dependent upon 
oxidation. The accumulation of carbonic acid in the breathed air 
would also have a similar arrestive power over destructive assimila- 
tion. These prisoners do not seem to have felt any of the severer 
pangs of hunger, for they were not tempted to eat their candles^ 
With the instinctive feeling that darkness adds a horror to death, 
they preferred to use them for light. 

It is a paradoxical fact that the supply of the stomach even from 
the substance of the starving individual's body should tend to pro- 
long life. In April, 1874, a case was recorded of exposure in an open 
boat for thirty-two days of three men and two boys, with only ten 
days' provisions, exclusive of old boots and jelly-fish. They had a 
fight in their delirium, and one was severely wounded. As the blood 
gushed out he lapped it up ; and instead of suffering the fatal weak- 
ness which might have been expected from the hemorrhage, he seems 
to have done well. Experiments have been performed by a French 
physiologist, M. Anselmier ("Archives G6n. de Medecine," 1860, 
vol. i., page 169), with the object of trying to preserve the lives of 
dogs by what he calls " artificial autophagy." He fed them on the 
blood taken from their own veins daily, depriving them of all other 
food, and he found that the fatal cooling incident to starvation was 
thus postponed and existence prolonged. Life lasted till the emacia- 
tion had proceeded to six-tenths of the animal's weight, as in Chos- 
sat's experiments, extending to the fourteenth day, instead of ending 
on the tenth day, as was the case with other dogs which were not 
bled. 

These instances of the application of the art of dietetics to the 
treatment of disease are suflBcient to show the principles which 
should be kept in sight. The pathology of the ailment should be 
considered first, then its bearing upon the digestive organs, and last- 
ly the bearing of the digestive organs upon it. 



356 I>IET IN HEALTH AND DISEASE. 

And before quitting the subject of health as affected by diet, the 
common- sense hint may be given to those who are in good sanitary 
condition, that they cannot do better than let well alone. The most 
trustworthy security for future health is present health, and there 
is some risk of overthrowing Nature's work by overcaring. 

Pleasuee as an Object of Dietetics. 

The social importance of gratifying the palate has certainly never 
been denied in practice by any of the human race. Feasting has 
been adopted from the earliest times as the most natural expression 
of joy, and the readiest means of creating joy. If ascetics have 
seemed to put the pleasure away from them, they have done so in 
the hope of purchasing by their sacrifice something greater and 
nobler, and have thus tacitly conceded, if not exaggerated, its real 
value. Experience shows that its indulgence, unregulated by the 
laws which govern our progress in civilization, leads to unutterable 
degradation and meanness, brutalizes the mind, and deadens its per- 
ception of the repulsiveness of vice and crime. But that is no cause 
why this powerful motive power, governed by right reason, should 
not be made subservient to the highest purposes. 

The times of meals must be regulated with a regard to the dis- 
posal of the remainder of the day, whether that depends on choice 
or on necessity. Violent exertion of either mind or body retards 
digestion ; and, therefore, when this is practised, food is not called 
for so soon as on a day of rest. The heaviest meal should be post- 
poned till the day's work is done ; it is then that social home joys 
give the requisite repose to the body and mind. Light eaters may 
dine as late as they please, but those of larger appetite should 
lengthen the interval between their repast and bedtime. After 
the night's sleep and the long fast which has emptied the digestive 
canal of its nutritive contents, a breakfast should be taken before 
any of the real business of life be begun. It is no proof of health 
or vigor to forego it without inconvenience ; but it is a proof of 
health and vigor to be able to lay in then a solid foundation for the 
day's labor. Not less than four and not more than six hours should 
elapse before the store is again replenished. A light, farinaceous 
lunch, with vegetables and fruit, may be made most appetizing, and 
is followed by a cheerful afternoon, whereas a ponderous meat and 
wine meal entails heaviness of spirit. 



ECONOMICAL DIETETICS. 357 



Diet in Relation to Economy. 



Due Proportion of Animal and Vegetable Food. — It has been 
taken for granted thus far that the mixed fare, which has met the 
approval of so many generations of men, is that which is most in 
accordance with reason. But there are physiologists who argue 
that our teeth resemble those of the vegetable-feeding apes more 
than those of any other class of animal, and that, therefore, our 
most appropriate food must be of the fruits of the earth. ^ And if 
we were devoid of the intelligence which enables us to fit food for 
digestion by cookery, it is probable no diet would suit us better. 
But our reason must not be left out of account, and it is surely quite 
as natural for a man to cook and eat everything that contains in a 
convenient form starch, fat, albumen, fibre, and phosphorus, as it is 
for a monkey to eat nuts or an ox grass. The human race is natu- 
rally omnivorous. 

Moreover, man is able not only to develop his highest faculties 
and perform all his duties on any form of digestive aliment, but he 
is able also very much to diminish the requisite quantities by a due 
admixture. The diet which supplies the demand most accurately 
will be the most economical in the highest sense ; and that this diet 
is a mixed one can be shown by the following method of calculation : 
We can measure by experiment the ultimate elements of all that is 
thrown off from the body as the result of vital decomposition — the 
ashes, the smoke, and the gases, which the fire of life produces; 
and thus we can lay down a rule for the minimum quantity of those 
elements which the daily food must contain to keep up the standard 
weight. If the diet be such as to make it necessary to eat too much 
of one element in order to secure a sufficient amount of another, 
there is a waste, and the digestive viscera are burdened with a use- 
less load. But there is no single article procurable for the food of 
the adult population which presents the exact proportion of elements 
required by an adult, and therefore no single article alone can supply 
human wants without waste. 

As an example, apply this reckoning to the elements carbon and 
nitrogen, which constitute the main bulk of solids in our food and 
in our bodies. Suppose a gang of 100 healthy prisoners to excrete, in 

1 Milne-Edwards, " Cours de Physiologie," volume vi., page 198. 



358 I>IET IN HEALTH AND DISEASE. 

the shape of breathed air and evacuations, 71|- pounds of carbon and 
4^ pounds of nitrogen (which is pretty nearly the actual amount of 
those elements in the dried solids of the secreta, as estimated by cur- 
rent physiological works). Both nitrogen and carbon to that extent 
must of course be supplied in the food. Now, if you fed them on 
bread only, there would be wanted daily at least 380 pounds of it to 
sustain them alive long, for it takes that weight to yield the 4^ 
pounds of nitrogen daily excreted ; while in the 380 pounds of bread 
there are 128|^ pounds of carbon, which is 57 pounds above the 
needful quantity of that substance.^ 

If, on the other hand, the bread were replaced by a purely ani- 
mal diet, there would have to be found 354 pounds of lean meat in 
order to give the 71^ pounds of carbon ; and thus there would be 
wasted 105 pounds of nitrogen contained in the meat, over and 
above the 4*- pounds really required to prevent emaciation.'* 

In the first case, each man would be eating about 4 pounds of 
bread, in the second, 3^ pounds of meat, per diem. If he ate less, 
he would lose his strength. The first would carry about with him a 
quantity of starch, and the last a quantity of albuminous matter, not 
wanted for nutrition, and would burden the system with a useless 
mass very liable to decompose and become noxious. 

When work is undertaken, much more is actually wanted. Ac- 
cording to Mr. Yizetelly, the laborer in a Spanish vineyard consumes 
daily between 8 and 9 pounds of vegetable food, consisting of bread, 
onion-porridge, and grapes.^ And when animal food alone is taken, 
as in the case of the Esquimaux, 20 pounds of it a day is the usual 
allowance. 

Now, if a mixed dietary be adopted for the gang of 100 prisoners 
before mentioned, 200 pounds of farinaceous food, with 56 pounds 
of animal muscle, would fulfill the requirements of the case ; 2 pounds 



1 Dr. Letheby's analysis gives 8.1 per cent, of nitrogenous naatter to bread (" Lectures 
on Food," page 6). Of this one-seventh is nitrogen, Boussingaulfs analysis of gluten giving 
14.60 per cent. (" Annales de Chim. et Phys.," Ixiii., 229). M. Payen makes the propor- 
tion of nitrogen to carbon in bread as 1 to 30. 

^ The proportion of nitrogen to carbon in albumen is as 1 to 3^ (15.5 to 53.5 by Mulder's 
analysis, quoted in Lehmann, " Phys. Chemie," i., 343). In red meat there is 74 per cent 
ofwater(ditto, iii.", 96).

Balance of Food and Work. — The most important modification to 
be made in the above estimate arises from the differences of work 
demanded. Men may exist in inaction on a scale of food-supply 
which is followed by death from starvation when they are put to 
hard labor. It is of importance, therefore, to have some measure of 
the effects of physical exertion. And here mechanical science has 
contributed to physiology a precision rarely attainable in our dealings 
with social economy. Mr. Joule, of Manchester, analyzed, about 
thirty years ago, the relation which the heat, used as a source of 
power in machinery^ bore to the force of motion thus made active. 
He showed that raising the temperature of 1 pound of water 1° 
Fahr. was equivalent to raising 772 pounds to the height of 1 foot ; 
and conversely, that the fall of 772 pounds might be so applied as to 
heat 1 pound of water 1° Fahr. Thus, the mechanical work repre- 
sented in lifting 772 pounds 1 foot, or 1 pound 772 feet, forms the 
"dynamic equivalent," the measure of the possible strength of 1° 
of temperature as marked by the thermometer in 1 pound of water. 
Physiologists seized eagerly on the opportunity which Joule's dem- 
onstration seemed to afford them of estimating in actual numerals 
the relation of living bodies to the work they hav« to do. So much 
earth raised on an embankment represents so much heat developed 
in the machinery, be it living or dead. The fully digested food, con- 
verted through several stages into gaseous, liquid, and solid excre- 
tory matters, produces by its chemical changes a definite amount of 
heat, of which a definite amount escapes, and a definite amount is 
employed in working the involuntary machinery of the body, and 
the rest is available for conversion at will into voluntary muscular 
actions. 

It may be reckoned that the daily expenditure of force in work- 
ing the machinery of the body — in raising the diaphragm about 15 
times and contracting the heart about 60 times a minute, in con- 
tinuously rolling the wave of the intestinal canal, and in various 
other involuntary movements, without anything to be fairly called 



360 DIET m HEALTH AND DISEASE. 

work — it may be reckoned that the expenditure of force in doing 
this is equal to that which would raise a man of 10 stone 10,000 feet. 

There are several reasons for believing that, in assigning their 
physiological functions to the several sorts of food, nearly all the 
business of begetting force should be ascribed to the solid hydro- 
carbons, starch and oil, by their conversion into carbonic acid and 
water, Just as there are good grounds for thinking that it is the con- 
version of the solid hydrocarbon of coal into the same substances 
which drives a locomotive. To the nitrogenous aliments seems al- 
lotted primarily the task of continuously replacing the wear and tear 
of the nitrogenous tissues, while any excess of them assists the starch 
and oil in keeping up the animal heat. 

One of the most cogent of the reasons for this view is that the 
chief nitrogenous excretion, the urea, is not increased in amount in 
proportion to the work done, as shown by the experiments of Messrs. 
Fink and Wiscelenus; whereas the excretion of carbonic acid in a 
decided manner follows the amount of muscular exertion. Now, it 
is very clear that, if the supply of power to do work depended on 
the decomposition and renewal of the muscles by flesh food, the 
urea must be exactly proportioned to the exertion, which is not the 
case. 

To give an example of the mode of working out a problem by 
this theory: Prof. Frankland, in a series of experiments made in 1866 
at the Royal Institution, and published in the London Philosophical 
Magazine, vol. xxxii., p. 182, ascertains with the "calorimeter" 
(which reckons the amount of heat evolved as a thermometer does 
its degree) the quantity of energy or force evolved under the form of 
heat during the oxidation of a given weight of alimentary substance. 
It has been explained that heat and mechanical work, being con- 
vertible into one another, bear a constant proportion to one another ; 
so that a definite production of so much heat invariably represents the 
potentiality of so much motion, used or wasted according to circum- 
stances. From the reading of the calorimeter, therefore, may be 
calculated how many extra pounds ought to be raised a foot high by 
a man who has eaten an extra pound of the food in question; how 
many steps a foot high he ought to raise a weight of ten stone (say 
himself) before he has worked out the value of his victuals. Prof. 
Frankland has thus estimated the comparative value of foods as bases 
of muscular exertion, and he has made out a table of the weight and

cost of various articles that would require to be consumed daily to 
enable a man to support life, the equivalent of which has been al- 
ready reckoned as the muscular force in action which would raise a 
man of 10 stone 10,000 feet.

After the supply of sufficient albuminoid matters in the food, to 
provide for the necessary renewal of the tissues, the best materials 
for the production of internal and external work are non-nitrogenous 
matters, such as oil, fat, sugar, starch, gum, etc. When the work is 
increased, not so much extra meat as vegetable food, or its dietetic 
equivalent, fat, is demanded. 

In comparing the cost of a daily sufficiency of the various foods 
to produce the required force, we must not forget the inconveniences 
which many of them entail. These inconveniences must be added to 
the cost. For example, suppose a man to have been living upon po- 
tatoes only, just supporting life with 5 pounds a day, and then to get 
work which enabled him and required him to take a double supply 
of non-nitrogenous food, he would act unwisely if he were to swal- 



362 I^IET IN HEALTH AND DISEASE. 

low it in the form of 12 pounds of cabbage. He would be knocked 
up by the sheer labor of carrying 12 pounds extra in a vessel so ill- 
adapted to. sustain heavy loads as the stomach. A similar objection 
would lie against milk or veal or apples, however cheap accident 
might make them; and a more serious objection still would hold 
against nine bottles of ale, or seven of stout. On the other hand, the 
over-concentration of cheese, beef dripping, and lump sugar, makes 
them nauseous when in large quantity or monotonously persisted in, 
though when introduced as a variety they are appetizing and digesti- 
ble. There is no saving in using that against which the stomach is 
set, or which the absorbents refuse to assimilate. 

Eeverting to the illustration of the gang of 100 prisoners, and 
supposing it were requisite to put them on hard labor equivalent to 
half " Frahkland's unit " of 10 stone raised 10,000 feet — such, for in- 
stance, as carrying up ladders, altogether 1^ mile high, 3 tons of 
stone daily— calculation would show that to add this amount of 
labor to the outgoings caused by the functioning of physiological life 
would involve the addition to their spare diet of at least 117 pounds 
of bread, or of 58 pounds of bread with 44 pounds of lean meat and 
63 pounds of potatoes. The slightest imperfection or indigestion of 
any of this would cause a loss of bodily weight, and cases of illness 
would be culpably frequent. Were a draught of milk, or a cup of 
cocoa and sugar, or some oatmeal porridge and treacle, or even a 
little dripping or butter or bacon, given, the danger would probably 
be averted. 

The most conspicuous fault in the dietary of the working classes 
is want of variety. Many of the articles which combine ample nutri- 
tiousness with small cost are habitually neglected, because, when used 
exclusively, they are disagreeable and unwholesome. From never 
being eaten they become absolutely unknown. There are many sorts 
of cheap beans, vetches, and peas, unheard of except at gentlemen's 
tables, of which a complete meal may be made, or which may sup- 
port the dish of meat; while beet- root, cresses, kail, carrots, and 
other plants easily grown, are left unused. 

Quantity of Food required. — The calculations of Dr. PI ay fair 
" on the food of man in relation to his useful work " ^ enable us, by 
another route, to arrive at an estimate of what amount of solid

QUANTITY OF FOOD REQUIRED. 3^3 

victuals is required by an adult living by bodily labor to preserve his 
health under various circumstances. The circumstances which chiefly 
affect the question can be classified thus: (1) bare existence; (2) 
moderate exercise ; (3) active work ; and (4) hard work. 

1. The first is calculated from the mean of sundry prison dietaries, 
of the convalescents' diet at hospitals, that of London needlewomen, 
and of that supplied during the Lancashire cotton famine, as reported 
by Mr. Simon. The result is that, in a condition of low health, with- 
out activity, 2J ounces of nitrogenous food, 1 ounce of fat, 12 ounces 
of starch, and J of an ounce of mineral matters a day are necessary. 
The amount of carbon in this is equal to 7.44 ounces. In other 
words, a man's life will be shortened or burdened by disease in the 
future, or he will die of gradual starvation, unless his provision for a 
week is equivalent to three pounds of meat with one pound of fat on 
it, or with the same quantity of butter or lard, two quartern loaves 
of bread, and about an ounce of salt and other condiments. If he 
cannot get meat, he must supply its place with at least two extra 
quartern loaves, or about a stone and a half of potatoes, or between 
five and six pounds of oatmeal, unless he is, indeed, so fortunate as 
to be able to get skim milk, of which five pints a week will replace 
the meat. 

A person reduced to bare existence diet can undertake no habitual 
toil, mental or bodily, under the penalty of breaking down. 

" Bare existence " diet is that which requires to be estimated for 
administration to certain classes of the community who have a claim 
on their fellow-countrymen that their lives and health shall be pre- 
served in statu quo, but nothing further. Such are prisoners, pau- 
pers, or the members of a temporarily famine-stricken community. 

It would be obviously unjust to apply the same scale of quantity 
and quality to all persons under varying circumstances of constitu- 
tion and outward surroundings ; and to attempt to feed in the same 
way all these people for short or long periods, idle or employed, 
with light work or hard work, in hot or in cold weather, excited by 
hope or depressed by failure, involves an error of either excess or 
defect, or both at once. The dietaries recommended by the Home 
Office for prisoners very properly take all these circumstances into 
consideration. They allot "bare existence" diet only to those sen- 
tenced for short terms without labor. And they recognize the fact 
that a man's health is not injured (perhaps sometimes it is improved) 



364 DIET IN HEALTH AND DISEASE. 

by a few days of such abstinence as would in the long-run be dele- 
terious to him. Under a sentence of seven days, a prisoner gets 
daily one pound of bread and a quart of gruel containing four ounces 
of oatmeal. For more than seven and under twenty-one days, he 
has an extra half pound of bread. For longer terms it is advised to 
add potatoes and meat. 

The nutritive value of the first-named diet is thus calculated by 
Dr. Pavy ("Treatise on Food," page 415) : 

Nitrogenous matter 1.800 ounce. 

Fat 480 " 

Carbohydrates 10.712 " 

Of the second : 

Nitrogenous matter 2.448 ounces. 

Fat 608 " 

Carbohydrates 14.792 " 

In the convict establishments prisoners are all under long sen- 
tences, and are classified for dietetic purposes according to their 
occupation. 

The sparest of all is called " punishment diet," and is administered 
for offenses against the internal discipline of the prison. It is equiv- 
alent to corporeal chastisement, being designed to make the stomach 
a source of direct pain. It is limited to a period of three days, and 
fully answers its purposed end as a deterrent by causing the solar 
plexus to experience the greatest amount of distress it is capable of ; 
for after the expiration of that period sensation becomes blunted. 
It consists of one pound of bread and as much water as the prisoner 
chooses to drink. This last-named concession is not an unimportant 
one; for it has been already remarked that a supply of fluid enables 
starvation, and by implication abstinence, to be longer borne. At 
the same time, it probably postpones the anaesthesia, and therefore 
makes the intended suffering more real. "Punishment diet" con- 
tains, in Dr. Pavy's estimate: 

Nitrogenous matter 1.296 ounce. 

Carbohydrates 8.160 " 

Fat 0.256 " 

Mineral matter 0.868 " 

Total of dry solids 10.080 " 



GOVERNMENT DIETARIES. 365 

This is about half of what an average man requires to sustain him- 
self without work, and under its discipline he would probably lose 
three or four ounces of his weight daily till his bodily substance was 
reduced by six-tenths, at which period, according to Ohossat's exper- 
iments, he would die. 

"Penal diet" is that which is apportioned for more protracted 
punishment. It may be continued for three months. It consists of 
20 ounces of bread, 8 ounces of oatmeal, 20 ounces of milk, and 16 
ounces of potatoes daily. Its chemical constituents are as follows: 

Nitrogenous matter 8.7S4 ounces. 

Carbohydrates 19.864 " 

Fat 1-5S0 " 

Mineral matter 0.972 " 

Total of dry soUds .., 2G.200 " 



Upon this diet a fair amount of work may be done. The 
combustion of the carbohydrates evolves sufficient force to raise a 
ton 4,193 feet; and thus the effete muscular substance may be worn 
off by destructive assimilation, making place for new muscle derived 
from the nitrogenous matter, of which a bare sufficiency, but yet 
probably a sufficiency, is supplied. A man of strong constitution is 
usually found at the end of it to be in good health and of normal 
weight ; yet he has never probably experienced the content which 
arises from a luxits consumption of food. It is intended to deny him 
the normal pleasure of the accumulation of reserve force in the gas- 
tric region. This pleasurable sensation under ordinary circumstances 
much promotes digestion, so that the whole of the ingesta are made 
the best use of; and therefore in " penal diet," as above quoted, it 
has been found expedient to introduce the slight excess to be no- 
ticed above what is needful to accomplish the required work in 
"foot-tons" {see before). The penalty of the regimen involves a 
certain degree of waste. 

A close imitation of " penal diet " is that which the duty of a 
responsible government demands should be served out during a tem- 
porary famine, that is, one calculated not to last above three months. 
It is more economical to introduce the elements of variety in the 
diet than to be too monotonous — that is, to save in the daily issue 
and to be occasionally liberal, to feast from time to time as a break 



366 I>IET IN HEALTH AND DISEASE. 

in tlie regular fast. The expense of the excess is more than replaced 
by the diminished habitual ration, and that powerful preservative of 
life, anticipation of pleasure, is brought iuto play. A reduction of 
the allowance below what experience has indicated as " bare exist- 
ence diet," made during the famine in Madras in the beginning of 
1877, was attended with disastrous results. 

By dint of mixing and varying his diet, and making it consist 
of very nutritious articles, such as bread, meat, yolk of eggs, and 
soup, Signor Oornaro succeeded in reducing tlie quantity he daily 
consumed to as little as 12 ounces (Venetian). But then he made 
the solids go much farther by the addition of 14 ounces of good 
wine. And the probability is that this gentleman had a peculiar 
constitution, for, in spite of his many readers, he has had no imi- 
tators of the experiment on their own persons. 

2. The appropriate food of the second class may be fairly repre- 
sented by the dietaries of European soldiers in time of peace. The 
English soldier on home service, according to Dr. Parkes, receives 
from Government 5J- pounds of meat and 7 pounds of bread weekly, 
and buys additional bread, vegetables, mijk, and groceries out of his 
pay. Such a diet is suflScient for anybody under ordinary circum- 
stances of regular light occupation ; but should extra demands be 
made upon mind or body, weight is lost, and, if the demands continue 
to be made, the health will suffer. Mr. F. Buckland, surgeon in 
the Guards, remarks {Society of Arts Journal^ 1863, quoted by Dr. 
Playfair) that, though the sergeants in the Guards fatten upon their 
rations, the quantity is not enough for recruits during their drill. 

The Prussian soldier during peace gets weekly from his canteen 
11 pounds 1 ounce of rye bread and not quite 2^ pounds of meat. 
This is obviously insufficient, but under the conscription system it is 
reckoned that he will be able to make up the deficiency out of his 
own private means, or obtain charitable contributions from his 
friends. Dr. Hildesheim (" Die Normal-Diat," Berlin, 1856, page 60) 
states that asthenic diseases are very common in the army, which 
leads to the inference that the chance assistance on which the author- 
ities lean is not trustworthy. As the legal ration in these two ser- 
vices does not profess to be a man's full food, it is needless to analyze 
it. In the French infantry of the line, each man during peace gets 
weekly 15 pounds of bread, 3^^^ pounds of meat, 2^ pounds of haricot 
beans or other vegetables, with salt and pepper, and If ounce of 



ECONOMICAL DIETARIES. 367 

brandy. This seems to be enough to support a man under light 
employment. Its analysis gives : 

Water 179.83 oimces. 

Nitrogenous matter (or albuminates) 30.17 " 

Fat 9.29 " 

Carbohydrates (or starch) 126 84 " 

Total of dry solids 166.80 " 

An Austrian under the same circumstances receives 13.9 pounds 
of bread, ^ pound of flour, and 3.3 pounds of meat. The alimentary 
contents are: 

Water 129.50 ounces. 

Nitrogenous matter. 27.40 " 

Fat a23 " 

Carbohydrates 1 19.45 ** 

Total of dry soUds 155.08 •♦ 

The Russian conscript is allowed weekly : * 

Black bread 7 pounds. 

Meat • 7 pounds. 

Kawass (beer) . .'. 7.7 quarts. 

Sour cabbage 24^ gills— 122i ounces. 

Barley 24f gills— 122f ounces. 

Baits 101 ounces. 

Horse-radish 28 grains. 

Pepper 28 grains. 

Vinegar 5i gills— 26i ounces. 

The " moderate exercise " of brain and muscle combined in the 
above classes is fairly represented in the convict scale by "light 
labor " (such as oakum picking) and by " industrial employment " 
(such as tailoring, cobbling, Roman mosaic and mat making, basket 
weaving, etc.). The dietary for prisoners thus engaged is nearly 
identical, except that the artisans using their brains are supplied 
with about an ounce extra daily. 

The " industrial employment diet " for a week is thus analyzed 
by Dr. Pavy :

This is probably a fair model for the most economical dietary on 
which an artisan or laborer on light work can thrive. It may bo 
observed that the principle of variety is very conspicuous, and in 
private life it is possible to introduce still more variety by cook- 
ery. In the English and Prussian armies the introduction of va- 
riety is left to be attained by forcing the soldier to purchase some 
portion of his food out of his own pocket ; in the French scale it 
is managed by issuing spices and various vegetables, and trusting 
to the innate genius of the Gaulish warrior for cooking. The issue 
of an occasional glass of brandy on holidays makes an agreeable 
change and benefits digestion; but if wine could be obtained it would 
be better and not extravagant. The Austrian bill of fare is sadly 
monotonous. The Russian ration may be noticed as particularly 
liberal of accessory and antiscorbutic food, from which civil as well 
as military dieticians might take a useful hint. Vinegar and other 
vegetable acids are too much neglected by our handicraftsmen and 
soldiers. The Carthaginians are stated by Aristotle to have used 
vinegar as a substitute for wine during their campaigns ; and the 
recipes given by Cato for flavoring vinegar with fruits show that it 
was in use among the laboring population in Italy. 

3. "Active" laborers are those who get through such an amount 
of work daily, exclusive of Sundays, as may be represented by a walk

of twenty miles. In this class are soldiers during a campaign, letter- 
carriers, and engineers employed on field-work or as artisans. These 
habitually consume on the average about a fifth more nitrogenous 
food and twice as much fat as the last class, while the quantity of 
vegetable hydrocarbons is not augmented, except in the Koyal Engi- 
neers. 

The " hard-labor diet " of convict prisons fairly represents what 
the authorities consider the minimum. It is the same as that already 
described as " industrial-employment diet," with the following addi- 
tions: barley, one ounce; bread, twenty ounces; shins for soup, 
eight ounces; carrots, one ounce; onions, one-half ounce ; turnips, 
one ounce. It contains, however, fourteen ounces less milk and one 
ounce less " meat." 

The nutritive value of the additions may be seen by Dr. Pavy's 
alimentary analysis, which is as follows :

lent to an augmentation of the diet. The additions are more judi- 
cious than those made by the classes above mentioned, who partly 
furnish their own food; for bread and vegetables constitute a large 
portion of the convict ration, and the extra quantity of soup replaces 
the lost milk, without risk of the waste in cooking, common when 
the uneducated deal with solid meat. 

4. " Hard work " is that got through by English navvies, hard- 
worked weavers, and blacksmiths, etc., which is more earnest and in- 
tense than the enforced '' hard labor " of the convict. It is difficult 
to obtain accurate information, but it would appear from Dr. Play- 
fair's estimates that the customary addition to the diet is entirely in 
nitrogenous constituents. The higher their wages, the more meat the 
men eat. 

The neglect of vegetables by the last two classes is, in a physio- 
logical point of view, imprudent, and possibly may be a contributing 
cause of an inordinate thirst for alcohol which impoverishes and de- 
grades many among them. To satisfy their instinctive craving for a 
hydrocarbon, they take one convenient, indeed, in some respects, 
but of which any excess is unwholesome. The discovery already 
mentioned of the production of force from the assimilation of starch 
leads to a knowledge, opposed to old prejudices but supported by ex- 
perience, that the raising of the energies to their full height of use- 
fulness may be effected by vegetable food quite as well as by the 
more stimulating and more expensive animal nutriment, or by the 
more rapidly absorbed alcohol. 

With regard to the tables quoted above, in which ultimate analy- 
ses are used as data for dietetic rules, it must be noticed that their 
authors deprecate arguments being founded on any but the very 
broadest characters of the articles analyzed. Specimens, even when 
of the highest quality, differ strangely from one another. Season, soil, 
modes of culture, the variations of species, and many other little- 
known influences, come into play and prevent our taking the market 
names of eatables as representatives of a definite chemical constitu- 
tion. And it may be added that ample scope should be allowed for 
the peculiarities of the individual and of his life-history. In the ap- 
plication of general rules, some one must be trusted to relax or strain 
them when circumstances require, or failures of a fatal character may 
occasionally result, and more often a galling perversion of justice. 



CARE IN REDUCING THE DIET. 371 

Estimates for the thrifty management of food-supply have usually 
reference to the feeding of others rather than to the calculation of 
a man's own dietary. Enough has been said on that point under the 
head of the influence of diet upon health ; and if a person really 
wants to bring down the expense of feeding himself to the lowest 
point, he can readily rate himself under one of the classes enumer- 
ated above, and act accordingly. It may, however, be doubted 
whether it is wise to reduce the diet to the minimum which the work 
requires. The certain evils of an accidental deficiency, or of a mis- 
calculation, are so serious that the danger outweighs the possible in- 
convenience of a slight excess. It were an unthrifty thrift, indeed, 
which imperiled vigor of mind and body to effect a pecuniary sav- 
ing ; for there is no investment so remunerative as high health. A 
man need not consider that he is wasteful when he spends money 
upon making his bill of fare palatable and provocative of indulgence 
to the extent of moderate superfluity. Pleasure and prudence here 
walk hand in hand.

LESSONS IN COOKERY: 



Hand-book of the National Trainingr-Scliool for Cookeiv. South 
Kensington, London. To which is added the Principles of 
Diet in Health and Disease, by Thomas K. Chambers, M. D. 
Edited by Eliza A. IToumans. In one vol.* 12mo, 382 pagres 
bound in cloth. Price, $1.50. 



This is an important work for such American housekeepers as are interested 
in the principles of ^ood cookery; but it differs so much from ordinary cook- 
books that, to prevent misunderstanding, it is needful to call attention to its 
BDfcCial features. Emanating from a school, and that school a working kitchen, 
the manual is beyond comparison the most thoroughly practical cook-book for 
general use that has ever been made. 

The novelty and merit of the work are in the method by which it secures 
successful practice. Its lossons, the plainest, easiest, and fullest, anywhere to be 
found, have grown out of a long and painstaking experience in finding out the 
best plan of teaching beginners and ignorant persons how to cook well. They 
were perfected throuirh the stupidities, blunders, mis'takes, questionings, and 
difficulties, of hundreds of pupils, of all ages, grades, and capacities, under the 
careful direction of intelligent, practical teachers. 

A cook-book's highest test is. Does it actualljr teach the art of cookery, or will 
it make good practical cooks ? Thus judged, this volume is without a rival. It 
is not a mere compilation, nor the work of any one person. The managers of 
the training-school found that there was no cook-book suitable for their pur- 
poses, and that they must make one. The proof of its success is that, by follow- 
ing its simple directions, many hundred women have become qualified to fill 
responsible situations as cooks, or to instruct their daughters or servants in 
cookery, or to go out and estabhsh other cooking-schools themselves. 

Ordinary cook-books boast of the rarity, novelty, or great extent, of their re- 
ceipts. The "Lessons in Cookery" makes no claim of tliis kind. Those who 
look in it for the last touches in oysters, terrapin, cake, or ice-cream, will be 
disappointed. There are thousands of English receipts that will not be found in 
it, and, of course, it does not treat of the dishes that are special to this country. 
The receipts of the work are lessons in practice, and these occupy so much space 
that a great multitude could not be furnished. 

The volume, however, covers sufficient ground for a liberal and varied diet. 
It contains upward of 200 lessons in the preparation of a wide ran<re of dishes- 
soups, fii^h, meats, poultry, game, vegetables, entrees, souffles, puddings, jellies, 
creams, rolls, biscuit, bread, and a variety of suitable dishes for the sick. The 
wants of well-to-do families as well as those of more moderate means are thus 
amply provided for. 

The chief advantage of the book consists in its efficient method of improving 
the quality of common cookery. In this respect it is strong where other books 
are defective. It will be useful in cooking-schools, cooking-classes, and cock- 
ing-clubs ; but it will be still more useful in private kitchens. Many American 
women know how to cook well, but they are not so successful in teaching what 
they know to others. By the aid of these simple let^sous they may turn their 
kitchens into little domestic cooking-schools, and thus elevate an important 
branch of household economy, now too much neglected.
