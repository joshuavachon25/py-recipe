INTRODUCTORY ESSAY. 



" OF making many books," says Solomon, " there is no end." 
But this was said long ago. What the wise king would say in such 
a publishing age as this, with all its societies and newspaper men, is 
beyond our comprehension. Have we too many books ? Yes, the 
number of worthless, bad books is legion. But how is it to be 
helped ? The demand calls for the supply and the supply increases 
the demand. The monster grows upon what feeds it. The age of 
sumptuary laws and of fetters for the press has passed and is never 
to return. A fair field and a free fight is all we can ask, nor do we 
.fear. Light puts darkness to flight; Truth must prevail at last. It 
is not to be supposed that Solomon meant there should be an end to 
book making. The writer of this introductory notice is constrained 
at least to recommend another book. Not a volume upon war or 
politics, but " THE HOUSEKEEPER'S ENCYCLOPEDIA," of twenty thou- 
sand practical receipts. This work has been carefully prepared by a 
Christian lady who has had ample experience. She is practically 
acquainted with good housekeeping, and labored for a number of 
years as a missionary in a distant land. Among all the works that 
have fallen under our observation, Mrs. Suddoth's seems to us de- 
cidedly the best. It is practical, easily understood and calculated to 
do much good. The style is not ambitious, there is no attempt to 
walk on stilts, nor to conceal thought, or the want of it, by fine writ- 
ing. The aim throughout is to do good, such good as a mature, in- 
telligent and pious lady would desire to do. The volume treats of 
" The beauties of a well-ordered home, its influence. The family 
relation. The Christian mother's influence. The Bible, the fireside 
pleasure. Comforts of home. Table conversation. The mother 
and the wife, her sphere, duty to servants, neighbors and church. 
Her influence not reckoned in time. Her compensation in eter- 
nity." 

The writer gives this introductory notice as a labor of love, be- 
cause of his esteem for the Christian character of the author, and be- 
cause of the noble purpose for which the volume is offered to the 
public, hoping that it will find a place in thousands of families, es- 
pecially on this side of oar continent, in the homes of our mountains 
and valleys, where everything is yet in a f onning state, and where 
the foundations of future greatness should be wisely laid and firmly 



10 INTRODUCTORY ESSAY. 

established in good family government and on sound principles, so 
that we may hope for the virtue and high culture of the generations 
to come. 

The subject treated of is indeed an old one, but never more im- 
portant than in our day. It is an old but still a sweet saying that 
awakens a response in many hearts, " There is no place like home." 
However far our prodigal sons may wander, their hearts " untrav- 
elled "' always turn to the home of the days of childhood's inno- 
cence with a warmth that nothing can altogether chill. There they 
feel sure of a welcome if all the world frowns upon them. They will 
not believe that the door of the home of their early childhood's holy 
hours can ever be shut against them. It is simply impossible to 
overstate the influence of a well-regulated home, nor is it easy to 
overestimate the influence of order, neatness and good cooking in 
making a happy home. Not a few of the ills that afflict both the 
body and the mind of mankind, and I must say also not a few of the 
sins and crimes of man, are fairly to be attributed to a disorderly, un- 
tidy home to bad cooking and slovenly housekeeping. The good 
God does indeed give us plenty of food, but alas ! many of our cooks 
are sent by the devil. It is marvellous that so simple an art as that 
of really good cooking and clean housekeeping is so little under- 
stood and practiced among us. We live by bread, but most usu- 
ally upon bread not half baked just such as the prophet called 
Ephraim's cake a cake not turned, burnt on one side and raw on 
the other, and the end thereof is moroseness dyspepsia. If I were 
a Lycurgus I should not be content with compulsory education in 
letters, but should require our girls to take lessons in cooking and 
housekeeping before they graduate from our schools to become 
wives and mothers. 

The world-famed Humboldt said, " The finest fruit earth holds 
up to its Maker is a finished man." The great Napoleon once said, 
" What France most needs is mothers." Every state wants real, 
true, honest, honorable, finished men, and the first requisite for such 
men is healthy, well-finished wives intelligent Christian mothers. 
France did need and does now need the right sort of mothers, but it 
is equally true of every other nation, and most of all is it true of Re- 
publican America, whose sovereign is the people themselves, and 
in our new states most of all, where society is in a forming condi- 
tion, and where the foundation-stone of the Church and State is the 
family. It is the Divine plan that society should grow out of the 
family. Every age and country is in proof that the home fireside is 
the greatest educational institution on earth. Its influence, more 
than any other, gives shape and coloring to the earthly and eternal 
destinies of mankind. In the nursery " the black spot " is to be 
wrung out of the human heart. At the family altar, hard by the 



INTRODUCTORY ESSAY. It 

hearthstone, the evil one is to be burned and cast out " They that 
rock the cradle rule the world." 

The mind of human beings at birth is not a blank sheet of pa- 
per. Somehow or other there is something on it as if written with 
invisible ink, that the least exposure to the heat of external life is 
sure to develop. This something may be called by the ugly name 
of original sin, or any other name you please. You may account for 
it by creationism, or traducianism, or any other theory, but still it is 
there. And hence, " 'Tis education makes the man." For what- 
ever may be said of the hereditary principle, it is founded on fact 
and nature. Every other part and faculty of man, even if the 
mind is a blank paper at our birth, is stamped with hereditary ten- 
dencies and peculiarities ; and these tendencies are transmitted ca- 
pabilities for good and for evil. Is the offspring of a good horse or 
dog likely to be good ? Why is it not equally true of the child of a 
good man, and still more of a good woman ? And if the parents are 
distinguished for any special ability, there is a strong probability that 
their children will inherit something of it, or at least that it will be 
called out by their education, if they receive one worthy of the chil- 
dren of such parents. Folly and crime are sure, however, to weaken 
the powers of any race or nation, or of any part of it. This illustra- 
tion is beautifully and truly applied somewhere in Kingsley's " An- 
cient Regime." 

The first paths trodden by the child may be scratched and 
crooked, or plain and smooth, but certainly in most cases his aged 
steps will be taken in seeking a return to them. An eccentric cler- 
gyman and wit of England, who lived about one hundred years ago, 
that I would rather not name lest some one should go to reading his 
works and get from them more poison than honey, says in his own 
way, " I dare say, good folks, you have all heard of animal spirits, 
as how they are transfused from father to son. Now this is not so 
inconsiderable a thing as many of you may think it. Take my word 
for it, that nine parts in ten of a man's sense or of his nonsense, his 
successes and miscarriages in this world, depend upon the motions 
and activity, and the different tracks and trains you put them into ; 
so that when they are once set agoing, whether right or wrong, 'tis 
not a half-penny matter away they go cluttering like hey-go mad ; 
and by treading the same steps over and over again, they presently 
make a road of it as plain and as smooth as a garden walk, which, 
when they are once used to, the devil himself, if he should wish 
sometimes to do it, shall not be able to drive them off it." 

Men may complain (for the most part unjustly} as much as they 
judge comports with their dignity, about mothers-in-law and the ex- 
pense and trouble of housekeeping, as if they knew anything about 
it, but it is the will of heaven that the society of women is a necessity 



12 INTRODUCTORY ESSAY. 

of national as well as of personal existence, both physically and mor- 
ally. It 's an ancient Hebrew proverb that " God always blesses a 
family or household through its women." If man fell from his high 
estate by a woman, it is through the same woman he is raised to a 
higher one. If a man discovered America, it was a woman that in- 
spired him and equipped the voyage. No matter who it is that ex- 
ecutes a great purpose, he was born, nursed and trained by a wo- 
man. The family is an institution founded by the Creator, and by 
Him constituted the greatest university on earth for molding human 
destinies. Nor can the divine laws be improved. It is His will that 
the wedded lamp be lighted at his altar and burn brightly and cheer- 
fully, and that children should come and grow up under its benign 
beams that our sons may be trees of righteousness, well grown in 
their youth, and our daughters be as corner-stones polished after the 
similitude of a palace. He is then an enemy to God and man who 
discourages marriage, or seeks to corrupt society by weakening the 
bonds of the family which God has joined together. As the child is 
father to the man, a first question is, what then shall be the manner 
of the child ? And the answer depends on the place, circumstances 
and earliest training of the child. Plato, in his book of the laws, says 
that he who is about to be a good man in anything whatever, ought 
immediately from childhood to begin to practice, even when engaged 
in playful as well as serious pursuits, the very things suited to the 
particular object he has in view. That is, the child should be taught 
what he is to do when he becomes a man. And there is great wis- 
dom in the Hebrew custom and of other people also, in teaching 
every boy some trade, no matter how rich the parents may be, by 
which in case of need he could make an honest living. 

The home, the school-room and the house of worship, and alas ! 
the streets, with all their sounds and sights, make our children what 
they are. The home, however humble, is the root that feeds the 
whole life. The education of children is like the nurture of trees. 
It begins with feebleness, its growth is gradual and slow, but is al- 
ways going on. Frosts may nip the sprout, and snow-storms come 
on the sapling, sunshine and tempests rock the growing oak, but 
from the acorn comes the monarch of the forest. The growth or 
education of children, physically, mentally and religiously, is always 
by degrees, and everything around them is an educator. The tidi- 
ness or sloven linen of the room where they are born, the landscape 
from the window on which they first gaze, and the pictures on the 
walls, and the hooks whose pictures and letters their eyes first trace 
out, men, animals and things the whole world of nature and art is 
concerned in and actually engaged to give them lessons. They may 
not all receive the honors of graduation at the high school or univer- 
sity, but they all graduate from the parental hearth and nursery. It

is there the precious metal is first molded into the shape which may 
afterwards be rasped and polished, but cannot be recast. There the 
lines are traced on a pliable nature that will become more enduring 
than if sculptured on marble. The lessons of our earliest home are 
wrought into the very structure of the immortal mind. The heart of 
the little one nestled in a mother's arms is a daguerreotype plate that 
receives whatever image is first cast upon it, but unlike the picture 
on the artist's plate, the living heart grows larger and stronger, but 
always carries on it the first impressions. They are the most dis- 
tinct and lasting. The tiniest leaves of the forest, of ages so long 
ago that we know not their date, have left their impressions upon the 
granite rocks. So with smiles or frowns, or vows that may have been 
carelessly uttered, and with the scenes enacted in the family circle 
they sink into the soul of childhood, though apparently at the time 
taking no notice of them, and yet their influence may be traced upon 
its every fibre forever afterwards, as if written with a pen of iron or 
the point of a diamond.* 

It was the mother's example and lessons of social philosophy, 
and experimental divinity that molded the character of George 
Washington. And John Quincy Adams says : " It is due to grati- 
tude and nature that I should acknowledge and avow that such as I 
have been, whatever it was, such as I am, whatever it is, and such 
as I hope to be in all futurity, must be ascribed under providence tc 
the precepts, prayers and example of my mother." Similar, strong 
and beautiful, are the tributes of John Randolph, of Roanoke, and of 
Andrew Jackson, to the influence of their mothers. " God bless 
mothers."

PREFACE 



IN the preparation of the ILLUSTRATED AMERICAN HOME BOOK, OR 
HOUSEKEEPER'S ENCYCLOPEDIA of more than 20,000 receipts (all prac- 
tical and tested), no expense, no labor, no research, or investigation 
of the culinary archives (both foreign and domestic) has been spared, 
while the arena of successful housekeeping has been quietly and 
thoroughly looked into from the standpoint of many years' practical 
experience, from closely observing the management of model house- 
keepers, both on this continent and abroad, many of whom have 
kindly contributed a number of original, invaluable receipts, thus 
augmenting those of the indefatigable author, not only from 
Europe and Australia, but from intelligent foreign residents in Africa, 
Turkey, Asia Minor, India, China, Arabia, Brazil, Columbia, Peru, 
Chili, Mexico, Sandwich Islands, the East and West Indies, all 
the South and Central Americas, and other portions of the world, 
which, in a culinary and remedial point of view, are above price. 
I (the author) have lived in several portions of China, have been 
in both the Indies, and have been in nearly every portion of the 
Union, canvassing for these receipts, but from whatever standpoint 
I have looked upon life and from many years' practical experience, 
my scope has been that of a philosophical, quiet- thinking, utilitarian 
woman ; believing that by this mode only the true alchemy of good 
housekeeping could be found, the genuine domestic philosopher's 
stone discovered. 

I have added many simple, yet valuable domestic receipts, for 
whose remedial, utilitarian value I can vouch and which can be used 
with impunity until medical advice can or cannot be obtained. 
These receipts are adapted to all climates and latitudes, to hotels as 
well as restaurant keepers. In families it directs in sickness, the 
nursery, diseases of children, etc., while the orchard, garden, the 
dairy, the poultry and farm yards, the laundry, toilet, etc., have not 
been overlooked, besides thousands of other practical receipts, which 
are above price to housekeepers, which can be referred to at any 
time, consulted at once as a judicious friend, an able counsellor in 
cases of emergency. It is a work well worth the comprehensive 
name it bears THE ILLUSTRATED AMERICAN HOME BOOK, OR 
HOUSEKEEPER'S ENCYCLOPEDIA. 



PREFACE. 15 

The introduction to the work is written by Rev. W. A. Scott, D. 
D., L. L. D., whose experience and well-known views on the subject 
of home and its various influences are too well known to need repe- 
tition here. 

In the preparation of this useful and valuable book, my interest 
has never for a moment flagged. It has been indeed to me a labor 
of love, for my thoughts have rapidly pressed forward to the time 
when the book will not only be hailed and welcomed as a friend and 
able counsellor and adviser in the many cases of emergency and 
doubt in households, when dishes or meals must be prepared at 
once, or remedies applied as with telegraph quickness until the medi- 
cal healing man is sent for and arrives, which in many sparsely pop- 
ulated and newly settled portions of the country is hard to be ob- 
tained and often impossible, for the medical profession must have 
something to support it; it cannot subsist on stones, nor exist by 
breathing the air, no matter how exhilarating or wholesome ; unless 
there is constant fuel applied to the fires of vitality, it will soon be re- 
duced to ashes, the hearthstone grow cold, domestic cheer be 
silenced, and the voices of song be heard no more as in many other 
important professions. 

The receipts and suggestions for housekeeping are suited to 
the cottage as well as to the palace. The wife of the poor man 
working for his daily bread, will find many directions for preparing 
cheap and savory dishes for her family, as well as simple directions 
for taking care of them when sick and out of the reach of medical 
advice. The rich, with unlimited means, will find directions for pre- 
paring the most luxurious dishes, and many valuable suggestions for 
getting up dishes for the sick and helpless invalid, which of all luxu- 
ries I consider the greatest a happiness so closely allied to heaven 
that it seems scarcely to find a lodgment on earth, and surely none 
but the pure in heart can testify to what it is ; for it descended from 
regions of love, and dwells in the bosom of those who are closely 
allied to Him (who was self-annihilation) who has pronounced them 
blessed, who aided the helpless poor, visited the sick, clothed the 
destitute, took care of the stranger, fed the hungry, etc., as doing 
these to Him in person. Because they can do no more, even a cup 
of cold water given in His name does not go unrewarded, and even 
a willing mind is accepted of Him who is a discerner of the thoughts 
and intents of the heart 

I do not believe that it was the design of an always benefi- 
cent Providence that there should be so much suffering in the world, 
but He has made man a free agent, endowed him with reason and 
not without some foresight into worldly matters, for the wise man 
tells us that the " prudent man forseeth the evil and hideth himself." 
But good men often fall into the hands of wicked, deceitful men, as 



l6 PREFACE. 

treacherous as the ocean wave, believing that all is well, and they sink 
with the first billow that surges them. When these misfortunes come 
there is always treachery, or extravagance, or indolence, want of en- 
ergy somewhere, and these misfortunes are then entailed often on 
several generations, till some one among them throws off the fetters 
that bind him or her and rises superior to circumstances, which 
often causes a shaking among the dry bones of the whole family 
compact ; each rises in full armor to contend with stern fortune and 
overcomes, yet not without many noble and honorable scars, of 
which they are not ashamed, standing on the pinacle of worldly wealth. 
Yet this remains seldom longer than with the third generation. But 
this will be discussed in another and proper place. To return 
again to the culinary receipts. I know that it is hard to prevail on 
cooks to follow the written directions of a receipt, and think that by 
simply using the ingredients without any proper proportions, 
that is all that is requisite, and hence the many failures in good 
cooking. For bad cooking is the most extravagant thing in the 
world, you lose your material, your fuel, the hire and sustenance of 
your cook, and then there is great outlay of bad temper on the part 
of the mistress, unless exceedingly good and amiable, and possess- 
ing a large share of that important, cardinal Christian virtue which 
"suffereth long and is kind." Bad temper makes inroads on health. 
The husband is disappointed in his meal and leaves, if in a city, for 
some place in which he can get something to suit his appetite, then 
the cigar and social glass must needs follow, his home in a measure 
given up, the spirit of himself and wife both wounded, which the 
wise man asks " who can bear? " Now this is extravagance again, 
but his forsaking his home may not stop here, it may lead to the 
gambling table, and other vices which will surely follow in its train. 
For extravagance opens the door for every evil, whether social, 
moral or intellectual, and which is so often entailed on his helpless 
ones. But there is a remedy for many of these ills. So, my sisters, 
let you and inexperienced housekeepers come, let us reason together 
for a while on this subject. Should you be a novice in house- 
keeping, and the important matter of conferring and retaining the hap- 
piness of your household, just take your cooking book, commit the 
receipt to memory if not too long, get all the proportions in your 
head and adjust everything in your mind as you wish it to be, then 
make up the dish in your pantry or kitchen yourself before your girl 
or Johnny (for all cooks in this country are either colored girls, or 
girls from the " Emerald Isle," or "Johnnies" from the Celestial 
country, no matter how long in service), let them see how easy it is 
to be done, go at it " right manfully," for the moment your cook 
sees that he or she knows more than you do, you cease to be mistress. 
If you do not succeed entirely to your satisfaction, prepare the dish 



PREFACE. 17 

another day, do it with your own hands, or direct, and it will be bet- 
ter ; then another the next day, and thus continue daily, you will 
soon gain confidence in yourself, as well as your cook, your culinary 
lore will soon be greatly enlarged, and in a few years will be a walking 
encyclopedia of culinary knowledge, a living magazine, which may be 
consulted at all times. Never suffer your husband to be dissatisfied 
even with the first meal, or even a dish, without conferring with him 
directly, watch his likes, and prepare by varying the dishes of which he 
seems most fond. Let him never have a dish before him that will 
offend his eye, olfactories, or palate. Pleasantly, but without seem- 
ing to, watch the expression of his face while partaking of his food. 
On the subject of bread making, butter making, and coffee, and in- 
numerable subjects, I have treated in their proper place, which may 
be consulted at pleasure. 

Let the approbation of your husband be the great design of 
your life, to keep it, for with your maiden simplicity you gained it, let 
him not realize, when brought in direct contact with your disposition 
and principles (after the man of God pronounced you one) the senti- 
ment of the poet, " 'Tis distance lends enchantment to the view." 
Let these be to him like pure untried gold, that they become purer, 
more refined, when tried in the crucible of domestic life, and brighter 
from the abrasion of the household duties ; though it has been a 
yoke, yet was easy and the burden light, and you have not been all 
the day idle. I know that your husband will think that he has the 
best wife and sweetest home on earth. 

Dr. Johnson says, to be happy at home is the ultimate result 
of all ambition, the end to which every enterprise and labor tends, 
and of which every desire prompts the prosecution. Though man 
governs, yet woman reigns, her throne is at the fireside, her seat in 
the heart, her empire the world, her household is her sanctuary, her 
place of worship and service. Her silver-toned voice, so full of gen- 
tleness, tenderness, and sensibility will send back the furious tide 
that boils and surges in the veins of her liege lord and master, 
soothe and calm down his passion, and stifle and assuage his rage, 
by reasoning and prayerful suasion, reduce the crimson tide back 
to its natural channel. 

Though a man's motto may be "excelsior" yet he may never be able 
to go up higher on account of the domestic clogs that may hang to 
him in the way of a thriftless wife. Whenever he attempts to rise he 
falls back on account of their weight. 

If woman has truly learned to keep house (for it is the "house- 
hold surroundings which affect most largely the happiness or the 
misery of domestic life), how to repair clothing, which can be altered, 
renovated or modernized, learns how to turn everything to the best 
advantage, and to make her supplies go farthest and longest, to

manage her children and servants quietly, appreciates the impor- 
tance of system, order and tidiness, then her home will be what it 
ought to be, her husband will not go to the club-house, gaming-table, 
nor quaff the wine cup, nor her children wander in the streets, for 
their training is one of social respectability and earnest for business 
success, and in whatever positions may be allotted to them, one of 
efficiency and usefulness. 

The time has come when all girls and boys should have some 
business habits, for the wheel of fortune is ever revolving, and no 
one knows at what turn he or she may go down. It may be by fire, 
extravagance, speculation, or through the treachery of a partner, and 
no one can tell in what form misfortunes may come. 

No girl should think of throwing herself on the world for a sup- 
port nor quartering herself upon relatives, and no parent knows or 
can tell at what straits a daughter may arrive in the course of a 
lifetime. I once saw a lady, who my mother told me had at her 
father's table a gold coffee and tea service, was educated at the first 
female school in the land, her father owned leagues of land on one 
of our famous rivers, had her French governess with her at home, 
the house and grounds superb (for I have often been in them), and 
everything that makes a home desirable was hers. She married 
wealthy, and in addition to her own grand estate her husband left her a 
large fortune, for he lived but a short time after their marriage ; her son 
was also left with princely possessions ; in a few years the widow mar- 
ried well again, a few years rolled on, when her husband, through the 
treachery of his partner, lost all, died of a broken heart, leaving 
her six little children to support. She did not even know how to do 
the simplest things. Her neighbors helped and encouraged her, 
still it amounted to nothing, when the mother and daughter were 
both lost to society, her thousand pounds of fine money went with 
the general wreck, her eldest son died a pauper. Alas ! I could fill 
a volume of similar cases if need be, that have come under my im- 
mediate observation, all for want of the proper domestic training, to 
learn to know how to do everything, for whether married or single, 
we know not what a day may bring forth. 

A great deal is said and written about not being able to get em- 
ployment, which is true, but why are persons notable to get work? 
Simply because they are not competent to fill the places for which 
there is a constant demand. Thousands could get places, with good 
salaries in elegant houses with board and lodgings, and with the 
thanks of their employers, were it known that their characters were 
good and they competent for their business, in the way of house 
girls, cooks, chambermaids, nurses and seamstresses. How many 
thousands of some persons' daughters for want of the means to 
house and feed and clothe them, sink prematurely into their graves

through the wiles of seducers fiends in human shape, that walk the 
earth, and whose very breath contaminates the air of heaven. Girls 
that would never have done wrong, had they not been driven to in- 
famy by the stress of poverty which would not have been, had they 
possessed knowledge enough of some calling to have saved them 
from such a dire calamity. Let every mother make note of this, 
for this great evil must alone be remedied by mothers, for it is a duty 
they owe to their own children, to society, to a common humanity, 
to bring up their daughters to be competent to do anything, whether 
in the capacity of chambermaids, dressmakers, washerwomen, as 
nurses or cooks. A good nurse will command from two to six or 
eight dollars a day for the sick when it is known that they are fully 
competent, faithful, trustworthy, conscientious, with the necessary 
tact and intelligence. 

If girls were taught how to gain a living, our large asylums if 
not entirely closed, would be greatly contracted, vice, crime and dis- 
ease, which seem to come together as by inheritance, would in a 
great degree, cease. Immense sums of money which go to support 
institutions for foundlings and paupers, would or might be appropri- 
ated to better purposes, and for the general good of the country. 
Let every girl learn some trade or housework, as though she might 
soon become poor, then she will have a life insurance in fulf, that 
she will never come to want unless through sickness. Then will the 
moral desolation of our large cities cease, their waste places be built 
up, and the wilderness of sin, misery and sorrow, no longer blos- 
som as the rose. 

Let the great, noble-minded, large-hearted, benevolent, intel- 
lectual women of our thrice blessed and happy country, with their 
example, and open purses,- step forward and dignify labor, raise as best 
they can the fallen, and stay the wavering, tottering steps of those 
ready to fall into the vortex of infamy Let the wealthy show by 
their own household and daughters that labor is no disgrace, for by 
it they will be much more likely to keep their wealth. For they will 
know how to keep who have kept their homes. What a blessed 
guarantee knowledge would be in such cases. 

Young men and women would marry, for then they would not 
be afraid to do so, lest one should hang as a dead weight and con- 
sume his hard earnings in doing nothing, or in hired wasteful help 
nor the wife on the other hand of her husband being a spendthrift 
and bringing her to want. 

I once knew an old lady who had been immensely wealthy and 
was then in comfortable circumstances, but she often said that her 
grand-children would serve the grand-children of those in her em- 
ployment, and which did come to pass. 

The husband should find in his wife and home a friend and sweet 
retreat, where he should find a gentle welcome, soothing sympathy, 



2O PREFACE. 

by whose sweet converse his cares will be beguiled and form a 
striking contrast to the scenes which he has just left behind, the air 
of peace, love and order towards him. Who can fix a bound to 
woman's influence and responsibility ? When we are poor, a little 
kindness, even in the way of recognition by a noble woman, goes a 
long way, when we have been forgotten and passed over by so 
many. 

In referring to knowing how to wait on the sick, I once visited a 
sick lady, a neighbor, who was suffering very much from a blister. 
1 asked the cause. She told me that the " doctor had told her 
daughter that as soon as the blister was taken off to apply a warm 
poultice, which we did, and which was to be renewed once in so 
many hours, until his return, but it stuck so fast that her daughter 
could not get it off, and was waiting for the physician to come tq 
show her how to remove it." I at once asked to see it, but to my 
great astonishment, I could not even raise the edges. I quickly 
asked the daughter of what she made the poultice, to which she 
replied that her " mother told her how, that it was made of flour and 
boiling water." I then called for some milk, which I warmed and 
applied to the horny edges of the plaster, which by much trouble 
and care I softened and removed from the suffering patient. Then 
1 had* to pick out the pieces of paste that remained on the blister, 
and made one of a soothing nature, oiled the edges and applied, 
permitting the daughter to see me make and apply it. The poor 
patient was soon asleep, for she had been suffering for hours. Now 
the mother and daughter were both intelligent persons, in the com- 
mon acceptation of the term, but neither knew anything about sick- 
ness. The mother had never been sick before, but died from this 
illness, and many of this large family died in a few years, as well as 
the daughter referred to. 

I shall ever remember the expression of the face of a sick officer 
of the Union army (a West Pointer), when he turned almost implor- 
ingly to his elegant wife and asked her to make a powder he had pro- 
cured into such a number of pills, her reply was that she had never 
made a pill and did not know how to do it, and that he ought to 
have got the druggist to make them for him ; he said that he was so 
sick that he forgot it. " Take the powder back and get him to do 
it." He said, beseechingly, that he was too sick to go out on the 
street, and might fall. I replied that I would make them for him, for 
which he seemed so thankful. 

The great way to supereminent success in housekeeping can be 
summed up in two words, indomitable perseverance, which means 
accurate critical observation, persistent action, and a comprehensive 
judgment, and with God's blessing no one need fear a failure in the 
housekeeping enterprise. 



GOOD WORDS. 

HEALTH IN YOUTH Late hours, irregular habits, want of attention 
to diet, are common causes with most young men, and these gradu- 
ally, but at first imperceptably, undermine the health and lay the 
foundation for various forms of disease in after life. It is a very dif- 
ficult thing to make young persons comprehend this. They fre- 
quently sit up late as twelve, one or two o'clock without experien- 
cing any ill effects ; they go without a meal to-day, and to-morrow 
eat to repletion, with only temporary inconvenience. One night 
they will sleep three or four hours, the next nine or ten ; or one 
night, in their eagerness to get into some agreeable company, they 
will take no food at all ; and the next will perhaps eat a hearty sup- 
per and perhaps go to bed upon it. These, with various other irreg- 
ularities are common to the majority of young men, and are, as just 
stated the cause of much bad health in mature life. Indeed, nearly 
all the shattered constitutions with which too many are cursed, are 
the result of a disregard to the plainest precepts of health in early 
life. 

WORDS. Soft words soften the soul. Angry words are fuel to 
the flames of wrath and make it blaze more fiercely. Kind words 
make other people good natured. Cold words freeze people, and 
hot words scorch them, and bitter words make them bitter, and 
wrathful words make them wrathful. There is such a rush of all 
other kinds of words in our days that it seems desirable to give kind 
words a chance among them. There are vain words,_ and idle 
words, and hasty words, and spiteful words, and silly words, and 
empty words, and profane words, and boisterous words, and warlike 
words. Kind words produce their own image in men's souls and a 
beautiful image it is. They smooth and quiet the hearer. They 
shame him out of his sour and morose, and unkind feelings. We 
have not yet begun to use kind words in such an abundance as they 
ought to be used. 

A WIFE'S POWER. The power of a wife for good or evil is irre- 
sistible. Home must be the seat of happiness, and must it be forever 
unknown? A good wife is to a man wisdom, and courage, and 
strength and endurance. A bad one is confusion, weakness, discom- 
fiture and despair. No condition is seldom hopeless when the 
wife possesses firmness, discipline and economy. There is no out- 
ward prosperity which can counteract indolence, extravagance and 
folly at home. No spirit can long endure bad domestic influence. 



22 GOOD WORDS. 

Man is strong, but his heart is not adamant. He delights in enterprise 
and action ; but to sustain him he needs a tranquil mind and a 
whole heart. He needs his moral force in the conflicts of the 
world. To recover his equanimity and composure, home must be to 
him a place of repose, of peace, of cheerfulness, of comfort; and 
his soul renews its strength again, and goes forth with fresh vigor to 
encounter the labor and troubles of life. But if at home he finds no 
rest, and is there met with a bad temper, sullenness, or gloom, or is 
assailed by discontent or complaint, hope vanishes and he sinks into 
despair. 

OUR CHILDREN. 

MENTAL EDUCATION. It is far better in an excitable child with a 
large brain and a healthy body, to keep it back in its education than 
to encourage the exercise of its memory in learning verses and other 
showy feats of memory. A dull child may of course be allowed to 
go as far as it will,- and may even be encouraged in every possible 
way, but many brains are not so early developed, that the contrary 
system is necessary, and all books and even music lessons must be 
postponed, until the strength of the body is confirmed by constant 
exercise and fresh air. It is the vice of the present day to attempt 
to force the intellect by early cultivation, and hundreds of children 
are yearly made more mediocre in their mind than they otherwise 
would be by overstraining the infantile faculties. For knowledge to 
be profitable, must be assimilated with the developing mind, and 
this may be one cause of our not having the great calibre of intellect 
that was found among our revolutionary ancestors, for the mind, like 
every other living thing, becomes dwarfed by the forcing process. In 
most cases a child ought to know his letters at five, but beyond this 
everything else may be safely left to a future day; and many first 
rate characters, endowed with the highest attainments are formed 
upon a foundation much later than this. 

SIMPLICITY OF THE PRIMITIVE AGES. 

The simplicity of the primitive ages has been an object of par- 
ticular admiration, and it delights the imagination to picture men 
living upon such fruits as spring spontaneously from the earth, and 
desiring no other beverages to slake their thirst, but such as foun- 
tains and rivers supply. Thus we are told that the ancient inhabi- 
tants of Argus lived on pears principally ; that the Arcadians revelled 
on acorns ; and the Athenians on figs. This of course was the Gold- 
en Age, before ploughing began, and when mankind enjoyed all

kinds of plenty without having to earn their bread by the sweat of 
their brow. This delightful period, however, could not last forever, 
and the earth became barren, and continued unfruitful until Ceres 
came, and taught the art of sewing, with several other useful inven- 
tions. The first she taught was Triptolemus, who communicated his 
instructions to his countrymen, the Athenians, whence the art was 
carried into Achia, and thence into Arcadia. Barley was the first 
grain that was used, and the invention of bread making is ascribed 
to Pann. The use of fire as an instrument of cooking must have 
been coeval with this invention of bread, which being the most nec- 
essary of all kinds of food, was frequently used in a sense so com- 
prehensive as to include both meat and bread. It was by the Greeks 
baked under the ashes. In the primitive ages it was deemed unlaw- 
ful to eat flesh. When men began to depart from their primitive 
habits, the flesh of swine was the first that was eaten. For several 
ages it was pronounced unlawful to kill or slaughter an ox, from an 
estimate of their great value in assisting men to cultivate the 
ground ; nor was it usual to kill young animals from a sentiment 
which considered it cruel to take away the life of those that had 
scarcely tasted the joys of existence. At this period no cooks were 
kept, and we learn from Homer that his ancient heroes prepared 
and dressed their own victuals. Ulysses excelled in lighting a fire, 
and Achilles was an adept in turning the spit. Art of living in every 
civilized country is pretty much the same. The instruments of cook- 
ing must, in a great degree, bear a striking resemblance to each 
other. 

THE BEAUTY OF A ^'ELL-ORDERED HOME. 

In training the young, the beauty of a well-ordered home is be- 
yond computation, for the mother presides over it. The first step 
that offers the sweet incense in domestic bliss on the domestic altar, 
for the happiness of those called her family, and kept perpetually 
burning from the fervent emanations of her unselfish, self-immolat- 
ing heart, or if her heart be wrung with anguish, she is still the same 
faithful being, knows no weariness nor abatement of interest in the 
welfare of her loved ones. It is in this home that parents can hold 
counsel and consider what measures are best for the government of 
their posterity. In this domain children can gather and gambol in the 
very exuberance of their young life in unmolested joyousness. It is 
here, after toiling through the day, the husband finds rest for his 
wearied frame, with his little ones full of frolic and glee around him. 
He feels that it is a sacred retreat, is thankful for his exemplary and 
affectionate wife, and bows his head in gratitude for his blessings. 
For there is nothing like a cheerful, happy home. 



24 THE BEAUTY OF A WELL-ORDERED HOME. 

The mother teaches her children that employment is dignified, and 
should be sought, as it strengthens the mind and body, and matures 
the character that will shine bright and lovely in moral excellence 
and active beauty. "The Author of every good and perfect gift " 
gave us six days to perform our own work, and the seventh day for 
rest. He whose tender mercies are over all His works would not 
have so ordained, had He not known that labor was best for us, as it 
would enable us to resist the temptations of our great adversary, 
who ever finds mischief for idle hands to perform. Teach your 
children to work for some good, let it be ever so lowly, cherish some 
flower, that labor is noble and holy, that there is a dread responsi- 
bility hanging over their existence, that God created them in His own 
image, and stamped on both their soul and body the sense of 
duty. 

We, as mothers, should teach our daughters the duty and practice 
of self-denial in some little things, in order to give to the poor around 
them, to administer a little to their comfort and happiness in sick- 
ness and in health. Should bring before them and the other child- 
ren the sin of being wasteful, that such and such things will make a 
nice soup or pudding for such a one who is sick, and that they may 
assist in making the dish and you will go with them to take it, and 
that the poor on their beds of sickness, often crave things which 
they are unable to get. I have seen the face of little ones lighted 
up with joy, and their eyes sparkle with gladness at such teaching, 
and these instructions will be more prized than if you had given 
an empire of wealth while the mantle of a mother's virtues 
have fallen on them, " for blessed is he that considereth the poor." 
The duty to the poor should be one of the first lessons to the young. 
We should teach them never to deny bread or charity at our own door, 
that their means, be it ever so small can do some good, we should 
instill in their young hearts the love of good deeds, the love of hap- 
piness arising from having done a good action, of their duty to God, 
their neighbor and all mankind. Every person whose wants are 
brought to our knowledge is our neighbor. 

OUR PARLORS AND OUR CHILDREN. 

OUR PARLORS are designed and expected to be always in readiness 
to receive visitors, where the dim of domestic matters will not 
reach their ears while the pleasure of entertainment goes on. The 
present mode of keeping the parlors dark in small country towns 
plays well into the hands of housekeepers, who perform the work of 
cleaning once a week. Where no child is admitted, but by a chance 
call, and to the children of the family it is almost a ("terra incogni-

ta") land unknown to them. But I do not think that this should be 
the case. How often do mothers or an older sister lead out of this 
consecrated place the unfortunate little or larger member of the 
household, who had seized the opportunity of going to see the pic- 
tures, works of art, and to smell the sweet flowers from beautiful 
vases brought from distant lands, and to handle the curiosities on 
the etagere. All of this is perfectly natural to them, and even to 
grown people, and handle the large and elegantly gilt bible, with its 
gay bindings, and other books on the centre table, to trace out the 
beautiful figures of the rich parlor carpets, and the handsome de- 
signs of the albumens embroidered by their mother, and sometimes 
they may mount the piano stool and begin to thump on the keys of 
the piano, or to pull the harp strings. Now all of this could be 
prevented by not making these things strange to them, by letting 
them go in with the older members of the family at pleasure. It 
would be no more a treat for them to enter it than any other room 
of the house. In doing this their manners would become more 
refined and easy, and there would not be that shyness and awk- 
wardness that we often see in mothers. Entering the parlor with care 
and grace speaks volumes in the mother's praise. Mothers or the 
older members of the family should explain all the family or histori- 
cal pictures, and where everything in the parlor is made, if at home or 
in foreign lands, to their eager minds, listening ears, and bright, 
sparkling, and soul-drinking eyes. Let them see and feel that noth- 
ing is too good for them, a spirit of enquiry is created, and they are 
consequently fitted to fill any place in society. For the hearts of 
children are pliant and tender as wax to receive the impressions made 
on them. In the beginning God designed woman as a help meet 
for man, to divide his cares and to lighten his toils, and not as a 
glittering toy or an expensive luxury, or a mere appendage to his 
household, or to add a long list to his expenses. No ; the whole 
domestic economy, as it existed in the divine mind, goes to show 
that the only true happiness realized in this relation is a mutual de- 
pendence on each other, a love unknown but to the pure in heart, a 
union of kindred spirits where each strives to lighten the burden and 
heat of each day for the other. Yet the entire happiness of the 
home circle, as well as the present and future welfare of the "little 
ones" is totally dependent upon the management of the woman, the 
mother. How very careful ought she to be in dealing out to them 
the good things of her house in the way of brandied fruits, wines, 
juleps, cordials, brandied and wine sauces, etc. Drunkards have 
been heard to say that their taste for strong drink was excited by 
these things, the flame of desire kindled by her own hands which 
often leads and entails misery on her sons and others in this world 



26 OUR PARLORS AND OUR CHILDREN. 

and eternal condemnation for them in that to come. Child- 
Ten have been known to break the eighth section of the decalogue 
to obtain the wherewith to appease the demands of the appetite 
thus engendered and cultivated, and that even from the mother's 
purse, which leads her to break another commandment by thinking 
hardly or openly accusing her innocent servant of the crime ; how 
could she think that the vice the sin was committed by the children 
she had so carefully trained, by the blood which flowed from her 
own. No ; this dishonest act could not lie at their door. It was 
done by her faithless domestic, who in all probability is dismissed in 
disgrace, and sent to seek a home and employment where she could 
find it, and where this accusation is not known, yet she appeals to 
her Maker with all the satisfaction of an approving innocent con- 
science, "Thou God, seest me !" Where does this fault lie?" No 
where but with the mother. For to her is given to sow the seed in 
the child's mind, which springs forth, first the " blade, then the corn, 
and then the full corn in the ear," her example determines the steps 
of her child towards virtue or vice, his reeling footsteps, his frenzied 
brain, his oath-emitting lips, his treatment to her, to his family, and his 
equalizing himself with the brutes or even below them, or she may 
by her example, elevate him to the highest standard of 
moral excellence, as a dutiful son, a worthy citizen, a kind husband 
and father, a noble patriot, an honor to his country and a blessing 
to himself and to the world. This has been done, and mothers can 
perform the glorious work again, and continue to repeat it till time 
shall be no more. But mothers often leave their children to the care 
and guidance, and at the mercy of the nurse, who may teach them 
many things which they should not know. And why do they do 
this? That they may attend the theatre or other places of amuse- 
ment with certain friends who are going, or to mingle in the pleasure 
of the ball room for a few hours at most, her face blooming with ar- 
tificial roses, her hair resplendent with gems, her garments radiant 
with real or false diamonds, and decked with jewelry flashing with 
stones, brought from the most distant countries, from the bottom of 
the ocean, or from the lowest explored stratum of earth's bosom ; 
leaving her little ones in piteous sobs, which perhaps to soothe, the 
nurse who feels no other interest in them than the amount and pay- 
ment of her wages, gives them drugs, thus relieves herself of what 
she considers a bore, or looks upon them with a threat of vengeance if 
a hint of what she has done is breathed by them. Yet while this is 
going on, the mother's influence is weakened, the ground into which 
good seed should be sown is preoccupied by the tares of wicked ex,- 
ample sown by .a hireling and an enemy. 



LOCATION OF A HOUSE. 27 



LOCATION OF A HOUSE. 



LOCALITY, ASPECT, AND PLAN. In choosing a situation for a house, 
the builder ought to consider very carefully, all the objections and 
advantages that may be urged for or against each spot proposed to 
him. To those who have lived in richly wooded districts, the sea air 
is a complete panacea for all their ills, not only because it is bracing 
from its saline particles, which are chiefly useful to the citizen, but 
because its air is free from the emanations of vegetation. But to thff 
dweller in exposed situations, sea air is often prejudicial, and instead 
of affording the relief to the ailments to which it is obnoxious, it ag- 
gravates them tenfold, unless he can find a warm and protected spot, 
somewhat like the one to which they are acustomed, and some of the 
secluded nooks in the interior. 

With regard to situation, then, it should be repeated, that a dry 
soil is always to be desired, and according to the nature of the dis- 
trict, either a high one, or else a moderately sheltered one. Gravel 
is desirable as a subsoil in all but very few situations, and even then, 
if it is very well drained, but nothing can be worse than a gravel bed 
which is locked in by a surrounding basin of clay, without any outlet 
for its rainfall. Such a spot is a sponge, constantly accumulating the 
elements of disease which are prejudicial, both to man and to some 
of the domestic animals, for it is notorious that such a kind of land 
is peculiarly fatal to sheep. It is not, therefore, the mere existance 
of a gravel bed which makes a spot suited to the habitation of man, 
but it also must be well drained, both superficially and in its subsoil, 
in order to be fit for his residence. It is astonishing what effect a 
small difference in the elevation has upon the salubrity of a particu- 
lar spot, A nse of sixteen feet within three hundred yards has been 
known to produce an entire change from a relaxing to a bracing air; 
this was partly caused by the lower spot being the bottom of a basin 
and completely enveloped in foliage, while the higher was compara- 
tively free from trees and had a tolerable fall for its surface water and 
for its drainage. Whenever there is a fall of ten feet to a running 
stream, the drainage in country houses may always be efficiently 
carried out, as far as the individual house is concerned, but this is 
not the only consideration, for the surrounding fields should always 
be well drained, or they will be constantly enveloped in fogs and be-

come fertile sources of evil. The side of a hill is not always a heal- 
thy spot, unless the herbage is scanty and is free from woods, or 
unless the surface water is uninterrupted by a break or drain con- 
siderably above the level of the proposed site and carried off in a 
different direction. No spot, in most cases, is more suited for a 
house than a slight rise or knoll which looks down on all the sur- 
rounding land, for here there is no chance for any annoyance from 
water courses belonging to other parties ; and malaria arising from 
stagnant water. Quickly running streams, so long as they are not 
subject to extensive floods, are never in any way injurious and may 
be made the means of carrying off all the unhealthy accumulations 
of a country residence. But dammed waters of all kinds, unless 
there is a good stream through them, especially stagnant ponds, 
should be carefully avoided near a house, however ornamental they 
may be. 

It may be gathered from what has been remarked, that the 
writer has a horror of water, and so she has, if in the wrong place. 
Water, like fire, is a good friend but a fatal enemy, and should 
be as carefully sought for in the one capacity, as it should be es- 
chewed in the other. It has already been said that gravel or sand 
in certain situations is highly desirable, that is, when well drained, 
and with these may be coupled sand-stone or lime-stone subsoils, 
chalk' and also primary rocks, these all give good air and some of 
them good water ; on the other hand, are high, dry and bracing. In 
the high-lands, health beams in every eye, and the step is elastic and 
firmer, if not always graceful. But in low districts the cheeks are 
pallid, the eye sunken and dull, and the step is inelastic, while the 
real heighth is apparently reduced to a stoop which amounts in many 
cases to a crouch. Spirits are drank in incredible quantities without 
those ill effects which follow their use in more healthfull districts. 
Though we have hitherto discussed the presence of water as a foe, it 
must now be looked upon as a friend which cannot well be dispensed 
with, and whose place, when absent, cannot be supplied by any other 
substitute. In some of the most healthy districts in other respects, 
water is a desideratum which can scarcely be obtained on any terms 
in dry summers, and the want of it is felt as a sore evil by its inhab- 
itants, and severe losses often are sustained by them in sheep and 
cattle for want of this fluid. Much here will depend upon the pecul- 
iar circumstances of the individual, as for instance, his occupation or 
pursuits, his family or professional connections ; the facility of ac- 
cess or the susceptibility of the neighborhood to his position in 
society. The district which will suit one man, may be either too aris- 
tocratic or too low for another. The frequent passing of omnibuses 
or street cars would be an annoyance to many individuals, while

others would not mind it. The same may be said in reference to 
railway stations, to which the daily traveler would gladly be near on 
account of the mode of conveyance, whilst the bulk of mankind would 
dislike its noise and tumult. Neighborhood of manufactories and 
mills will be avoided except by those employed about them. If tall 
chimneys are seen near the spot which is in contemplation, it is well 
to ascertain exactly what they are used for, and whether any noxious 
or offensive trades are carried on. In every case the drainage 
should be attended to, and it should be ascertained, either that there 
is a sufficient culvert near, capable of conveying off the house drain- 
age, or that facilities exist for a cess-pool ; where the habitations are 
not too high, it is thought that cess-pools are by no means objec- 
tionable, that is, provided they can be made at a sufficient distance 
from the house, but nevertheless, a well-arranged culvert is always to 
be preferred. In those cases, where large culverts are so built that 
they have little or no fall, and are never flushed except by storm 
water, they are far inferior to a well-built cess-pool ; for as they ac- 
cumulate their contents in enormous quantities, and daily receive 
fresh additions without passing^ them on, their gaseous emanations 
are bound to return through the traps in spite of all the care in the 
world in their construction. There is no Alteration to any extent, 
(or if any, it is in that way highly injurious to the basement floors of 
those houses which are next to the leakage) and consequently the 
bulk is not diminished sometimes for weeks or even months together, 
that is, as long as there is no rain. In a cess-pool, on the other 
hand, a man has the control of his own and is not annoyed by that 
of his neighbor, unless the neighborhood is very close, in which case, 
as before remarked, these receptacles should be avoided. Recently 
made ground should always be suspicious, as it is generally the seat 
of a reclaimed marsh, and as such takes many years to be made fit 
for human habitation. All filled up ponds are still worse where 
their vegetable matter has been burried beneath the surface. Water 
comes very high in the list of requisites in all suburban, as in fact in 
every other kind of residence. A good well of spring water can sel- 
dom be reckoned on, but it should be obtained if possible, but now 
companies supply a perfectly pure and wholesome water, which is as 
refreshing as it is most agreeable to the palate. 

Supposing a plat of ground is offered for sale in a neighborhood 
only partly covered ; it will be desirable to ascertain what proba- 
bility there is of the remainder being turned into an annoyance, 
either in the shape of a factory, a public house, or even in that of a 
place of worship, neither of which is a desirable building to have 
located in front of one's drawing-room windows. When a garden, 
either for flowers or vegetables, is desired, of course the nature of

the soil will form an object of inquiry. Lastly, the soil must be ex- 
amined in reference to the foundations, which are* sometimes a con- 
siderable source of expenditure when the building has commenced. 
Good rocks and chalk are excellent for this purpose, especially if the 
whole site to be occupied by the house is composed of the same. A 
good foundation, therefore, renders a spot so much cheaper than a 
bad one. 

THE ASPECT. To a certain extent, the choice of aspect is left to 
be decided after the purchase of a site ; but not entirely so, because 
in many cases of suburban residences the owner is compelled to build 
his house in conformity with existing arrangements, if not in a partic- 
ular plan, yet with a settled aspect. Here, therefore, he should pause 
and consider whether the aspect is a good one; but, for this purpose, 
it is right to know what is really good and the reverse. In this way 
we have two things to consider : the prevailing objectionable wind 
and the sun. In this climate, the wind which we desire most to 
avoid is that from the east or north sometimes one and sometimes 
the other being the worst, according to the protection afforded by 
the nearest mountains or hills; whichever, therefore, is the worst, 
neither the back nor the front should be turned that way, but one of 
the sides, in which there need be few openings. Again, it is of great 
importance to health, especially to that of young children, that they 
should have a plenty of sun, especially morning sun ; and, therefore, 
a north aspect is not good or cheerful, inasmuch as little sun can be 
obtained on that side. Neither is a full south or southwest aspect 
very much to be sought after, because here we have too much of a 
good thing, and are scorched by the sun's rays ; but a southeastern 
view of this luminary is the one which commands all the advantages, 
without any drawbacks, and is that which most people would choose, 
if they could. In this aspect we have the sun upon the breakfast 
table, which is the time when children are benefited most by its rays, 
and are rendered happy and cheerful for the rest of the day. The 
nursery, therefore, should be turned to this point, if possible ; when 
the heat of the summer comes 'there is all the cheerfulness and health 
which it affords in the morning, without the sultry heat of the after- 
noon. In town this is of a still greater importance than in the 
country. This fact has often been proved by comparing a number 
of young families on the two sides. 

I again repeat, in choosing a house, that the health and comfort 
of a family should be of the highest importance ; that the neighbor- 
hood of all factories of any kind, producing unwholesome effluvia 
and smells, should be strictly avoided. Nither is it well to take a 
house in the immediate vicinity of where a noisy trade is carried on, 
as it is unpleasant to the feelings, and tends to increase any existing 
irritation of the system. 



LOCATION OF A HOUSE. 3 1 

The aspect of the house should be well considered, and it should 
be borne in mind that the more sunlight that comes into the house 
with a south and southeast aspect, is lighter, warmer, dryer, and 
consequently more healthy, than one facing the north or northeast. 
The close, fetid air which assails us is assigned to the want of light, 
and consequently more unhealthy than one facing the north or north- 
east. One of the most essential points to be observed in reference 
to a house is its "drainage." Bad or defective drainage, as it has 
been proved in an endless number of cases, is certain to destroy 
health, as the taking of poison. This arises from its injuriously 
affecting the atmosphere, thus rendering the air we breathe un- 
wholesome and deleterious. Let it be borne in mind that, unless a 
house is effectually drained, the health of its inhabitants is sure to 
suffer, and they will be susceptible of ague, rheumatism, diarrhoea, 
fevers and cholera. An all-important point, that of the water sup- 
ply. The value of this necessary article has also been lately more 
and more recognized in connection with the question of life and 
health, and most houses are well supplied with every convenience 
connected with water. Let it, however, be well understood that no 
house, however suitable in other respects, can be desirable if this 
grand means of health and comfort are in the slightest degree scarce 
or impure. No caution in that can be too great to see that it is 
pure and good, as well as plentiful ; for, knowing as we do, that not 
a single dish of our daily food is prepared without it, the importance 
of its influence on the health of the inmates of a house cannot be 
over-rated. 

VENTILATION is another matter which must not be overlooked. In 
a general way, enough air is admitted by the cracks around the doors 
and windows ; but if this is not the case, the chimneys will smoke, 
and other plans, such as the placing of a plate of finely perforated 
zinc or wire gauze in the uppermost part of the window, must be 
used. Cold air should never be admitted under the doors, at the 
.bottom of a bed-room, unless it be close to the fire or stove, for it 
will flow along the floor toward the fire-place, and thus leaving the 
foul air in the upper part of the room unpurified, cooling at the same 
time, unpleasantly and injuriously, the feet and legs of the inmates. 
The* rent of a house, it has been said, should not exceed one-eighth 
of the whole income of its occupants, and we are disposed to assent 
to this estimate as a general rule. 

EVERY HOUSE SHOULD HAVE A BATH-ROOM. What luxury is 
superior to a good bath ! Immersing, showering or throwing the 
water over the body with the hand, it cheers, soothes, refines and 
elevates both soul and body. Keeping the body clean is only dis- 
charging our first duty to ourself. It produces such a happy feeling, 



THE HUSBAND. 



THE HUSBAND. 

Custom entitles you to be considered the " lord and master " 
over your household ; but do not assume the master and sink the 
lord. Remember that noble generosity, forbearance, amiability and 
integrity are among the more lordly attributes of man. As a hus- 
band, therefore, exhibit the true nobility of man, and seek to govern 
your own household by the standard of high moral excellence. A 
domineering spirit, a fault-finding petulance, impatience at triflng 
delays and the exhibition of unworthy passions at the slightest prov- 
ocation can add no laurels to your own lordly brow, impart no sweet- 
ness to home and call forth no respect from those by whom you may 
be surrounded. It is one tiling to be a master another thing to be 
a man. The latter should be the husband's aspiration, for he who 
cannot govern himself is illy qualified to govern another. 

When once a man has established a home his most important 
duties have fairly begun. The errors of youth may be overlooked; 
want of purpose, and even of honor, in his earlier days, may be for- 
gotten ; but from the moment of his marriage he begins to write his 
mdellible history ; not with pen and ink, but by actions by which he 
must ever afterwards be reported and judged. His conduct at 
home; his solicitude for his family; the training of his children; 
his devotion to his wife ; his regard for the great interests of eter- 
nity these are the tests by which his worth will ever afterwards be 
estimated by all who think or care about him. These will determine 
his position while living and preserve his memory when dead. He 
uses well or ill the brief space allotted to him, out of alt eternity, to 
build up a fame founded on the most solid of foundations private 
worth and God and man will judge him accordingly. 

HINTS FOR WIVES. 

Don't imagine when you have obtained a husband that your per- 
sonal neatness and deportment may be relaxed. Then, in reality, 
is the time for you to exhibit superior taste and excellence in the 
cultivation of your dress and the becoming elegance of your ap- 
pearance. If it required some little care to foster the admiration of 

lover, how much more requisite it is to keep yourself lovely in the 
eyes of him to whom there is no privacy or disguise your hourly 
companion ! And as it was due to your lover that you should al- 
ways present to him who proposed to wed and cherish you a neat 

nd ladylike appearance, how much more is he entitled to a similar 
f respect, who has kept his promise with honorable fidelity 



I 
HINTS FOR WIVES. 33 

and linked all his hopes of future happiness with yours ! If you 
manage these matters without appearing to study them, so much 
the better. Some husbands are impatient of the routine of the 
toilet, and not unreasonably so. They possess activity and energetic 
spirits which are sorely disturbed by the waste of time. Some wives 
have discovered an admirable facility in dealing with this difficulty ; 
and it is a secret which, having been discovered by some, may be 
known to all, and it is well worth the finding out. 

It is astonishing how much the cheerfulness of a wife contributes 
to the happiness of home. She is the sun, the center of a domestic 
system, and her children are like planets around her, reflecting her 
rays. How merry the little ones look when the mother is joyous and 
good tempered, and how easily and pleasantly her household labors 
are overcome ! Her cheerfulness is reflected everywhere. It is 
seen in t^ie neatness of her toilet, in the order of her table, and even 
in the seasoning of the dishes. We remember hearing a husband 
say that he could always gauge the temper of his wife by the quality 
of her soups and the lightness and delicacy of her pastry. When ill- 
temper pervades, the pepper is dashed in a cloud, perchance the 
pepper box is included as a kind of diminutive thunderbolt. The 
salt is all in heaps, and the spices seem to betake themselves to one 
spot in a pudding, as if dreading the frowning face above them. If 
there be a husband who could abuse the smiles of a really good- 
tempered wife, we should like to look at him ! No, no ; such a 
phenomenon does not exist (?). Among the elements of domestic 
happiness the amiability of the wife and mother is of the utmost 
importance; it is one of the best securities for the happiness of 
home. 

THE MISTRESS. 

A house-keeping account book should invariably be kept, and 
kept punctually and precisely to write or make an entry of the 
amount spent each day, let it be ever so small, arranged under their 
specific heads, of butcher, baker, grocer, sundries, etc. ; and thus it 
will be seen how much was paid for each article, and one month's 
expenses can be compared with another, and thus you can judge 
how much you can afford to spend by comparing it with what you 
have in hand. Truer words were never written than " No man is 
rich whose expenditures exceed his means, and no man is poor whose 
incomings exceed his outgoings." If the establishment be large, it 
is advisable for the mistress to examine her accounts regularly even if a 
house-keeper is kept ; then any increase of expenditure may be ex- 
plained which may be apparent, and the house-keeper have the sat-

34 THE. MISTRESS. 

isfaction of knowing whether her efforts to manage her department 
economically have been successful. It is one of the mistress' duties to 
exercise her judgment and discrimination in engaging servants. It is 
best for her to know something of the servant she engages ; and 
when engaging a servant it is best to make her understand before- 
hand what is expected of her and committing it to writing, giving 
the servant a copy of the agreement and keeping one herself, every- 
thing being plainly stated and understood by both. By pursuing 
this course there will not be so much contention in domestic matters, 
which should be deprecated, as well as a constant change of ser- 
vants. Among the great masses of society, there being exceptional 
cases, it is best not to choose a servant from the lower class. 

In obtaining a servant's character, it is best to have an interview 
with her former mistress, and then you will be assisted in your decis- 
ions of the faithfulness of the servant, whether she is honest and her 
moral character good. The proper observance of courtesy 
being character, in order to prevent any unreasonable intrusion on 
the part of a stranger, your inquiries should be very minute, so that 
you may avoid disappointments and trouble by knowing the weak 
points of your domestics. This is no unreasonable requisition, for 
in traveling it is expected that persons will carry letters of introduc- 
tion or commendation. In all kinds of business it is expected; and 
no one will for a moment employ a person that is the least light- 
fingered, tardy, or unfit for business; and he must bring letters from 
business places in which he has been engaged, or from competent 
and reliable persons, setting forth what they are, etc. How much 
more important in a domestic, who is in your bed-rooms, among 
your children, in your kitchen, etc. When this is done there will be 
less domestic discontent, both on the part of the employer and em- 
ployed. 

The treatment of servants is of the highest possible moment, as 
well to the mistress as to the domestics themselves. On the head 
of the house the servants will naturally fix their attention, and if they 
perceive that the mistress' conduct is regulated by high and correct 
principles, they will not fail to respect her. If, also, a benevolent 
desire is shown to promote their comfort, at the same time that a 
steady performance of their duty is exacted, then their respect will 
not be unmingled with affection, and they will still be more solicitous 
to continue to deserve their favor. 

The mistress should think of the late hours, and often of those of 
incessant toil, that her domestics are required to keep, and never 
withhold from them their full wages a single day, for they may be 
needed by their dependent family, or a sick mother and father. Even 
the perquisites they may get from visitors and others will be poor 



THE MISTRESS. 35 

compensation for the constant wear and tear of health and the use 
of clothing, for they are compelled to appear genteel while in service. 
When these matters are duly considered there will be found useful 
and attached servants. The sensible master and kind mistress know 
that if servants depend on them for the means of living, in their turn 
they are dependent on their servants for many of the comforts of 
life, and that in using a proper amount of care in choosing servants, 
and making slight excuses for the short-comings and imperfections 
ot human nature, they will, except in some cases, be tolerably well 
served, and in a large majority of cases surround themselves with 
attached and faithful domestics. 

Servants should look forward only to obtain the good will of their 
employers. By so doing they will be much happier, and find that it 
is much better for them, and "ye masters give unto your servants 
that which is just and equal, knowing that ye also have a master in 
heaven." 

Neither in the kitchen nor in any other part of the household 
should the authority of the mistress be disputed. The mistress, 
amid all her temptations to use angry or cutting words, should not 
for a moment yield to them, but remember that she is superior, and 
that pleasant words and respectful language to an inferior, or to one in 
a subordinate position, with a polite and dignified bearing, will exert 
a most happy influence, securing her respect and a guarantee that 
she will not have to repeat her polite requests often ; her lady- 
hood will be elevated in the eyes of her servants, while a corre- 
sponding sympathetic refinement will be exerted on them. 
A mistress should never give her orders in a haughty, chilling manner, 
which her subordinate cannot return without a loss of her place. 
Perhaps she may have an aged mother or other dear ones looking 
to her for the bread which her hard earnings furnish them, for ser- 
vants are not solely machines, or automatons, without feelings; yet at 
the same time they should feel and know that they are hired to do 
work, and should endeavor to perform their tasks to the best of their 
ability, and as nearly in the manner they are required to do them ; 
and they should never be wasteful in anything, and should always 
give the mistress a cheerful reception whenever she comes into the 
kitchen, and be allowed to direct new dishes, and even to share the 
labors of their preparation. 

The time, number and manner of receiving visits by servants had 
better be decided by arrangements between the employer and em- 
ployed. The mistress should teach and see that her children are 
polite and kind in their manner and speech to her servants, and not 
unreasonable in their demands upon their time and labor, and that 
they play no tricks upon them, and do nothing to impede their work, 



36 THE MISTRESS. 

so that the meals may always be ready for papa when he comes 
home, and that the performance of the duties of one hour may not 
be crowded into that of another. This will enhance the esteem of 
her domestics for herself and family, and make them more faithful 
and happier in her service, while her children will learn the 
golden rule, from practice as well as from precept, for the good that 
is learned in the domestic circle is never forgotten ; neither can 
scores of years, nor the circle of the globe, obliterate it ; and thus 
the comfort and happiness of children and domestics will be aug- 
mented. 

COMFORTABLE COOKING. 

Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends. [SHAKESPEARE. 

It is not everybody in the world who knows what a good dinner 
is or deserves to have one. Sonre people talk about cooking as if 
it degraded them and seem to think that no part of them is worth 
nourishment but what they have the impudence to call their minds. 
I don't want them to read my book, because I know that there's a 
great connection between beef and bones, but the man who dislikes 
the one, really has a very small share of the other. Almost all peo- 
ple whose work makes the world happier or better are fond of good 
living. The church, the bar, the stage, the sculptor's atelier and 
painter's studio, all send forth their vivants of the first water. It is 
for dear little brisk women who I want to make happy that I write ; 
for generous, hospitable, kindly, home-loving fellows that I am going 
to cater, and I should not wonder if we find ourselves very good 
friends in a little while by the aid of the ^printing press. It is more de- 
rogatory to the dignity of human nature to convert bad material into 
good food than it is to convert clay into bricks, and iron into bridges. 
On the contrary, if the choice has to be made 'between the brick 
and the beef, I know well enough which most decisions would se- 
lect. A young wife cannot do better than devise the daintiest little 
dishes her means will buy for her husband. A young mother cannot 
do better than concoct the most health-giving food for her child, and 
the matron of any age should feel proud and happy when men sit 
around her table visibly refreshed and invigorated by the food she 
gives them. 

Good cooking is a much more common accomplishment among 
rich people than poor ones. If a man goes to India, to Norway or 
to our Western prairies for sport, he must needs cook his own din- 
ner or do without it, and the gourmand who desires a new flavor 
often tries his hand at creating it. Stewed pigeons was a favorite 
dish with Louis XVIII., of France, before the Commune. You 



COMFORTABLE COOKING. 37 

might see any day in the Tuilleries the gold stew-pans he used in 
the preparation. George IV., of England, invented the best punch 
know to mankind. The famous Prince Talleyrand left in print the 
finest mode of cooking a pheasant, and the "Omelette au Thea" 
owes its origin to no less a person than Cardinal Richelieu. 

The way to a man's heart is through his stomach or palate. Give 
him nice things that agree with him and he will be as good as gold. 
Real Christianity and a good, healthy appetite are usually found to- 
gether. If you want to cook well and make people comfortable by 
your cooking, you must remember that three things are absolutely 
necessary before you can turn out the simplest dish. Those three 
things are perfect cleanliness, a careful measurement of everything 
you use and a strict attention to time ; therefore, buy a cheap clock 
tor the kitchen, a common pair ot scales and two or three simple 
measures quart, pint and half-pint measure and a graduated glass 
for tablespoon and teaspoonfuls. I will use no vague terms, and if 
you do exactly as I tell you the thing will turn out so well that all 
your friends will compete for invitations for dinner. 

REMARKS ON DINNER PARTIES. 

As this is to be a very economical chapter, devoted to cheap 
dishes and savings of all kinds, I hope that no person will read it 
who thinks wastefulness and generosity mean the same thing. You 
will be shown the great value in a housekeeping sense of the re- 
mains of your dinner, and be told what to do with everything that 
was left from the bills of fare for eight persons. By that time you 
will find that it is true economy to give a little dinner party now and 
then, because you will have as many nice things afterwards, which 
would not have occurred to you to make for yourself. In fact, a 
young couple could do no better so soon as they have fairly settled 
down to housekeeping than to invite a few friends to dinner as often 
as they conveniently can. The return invitations will enable them 
to show their accomplishments in society and to keep them au cou- 
rant with the world. The friendship that springs from the mutual 
interchange of courtesies and hospitalities rapidly developes into a 
warm feeling, and in a pecuniary sense it will "be found that -the lib- 
eral hand maketh rich. 

There is no reason why a young wife who lives in three or four 
rooms and has only one servant and a limited income should hesi- 
tate to give a little dinner, such as has been described in the first 
chapter. One-half the things can be rooked the day before and 
will be the better for it. The soup, entrees, custards, pudding and 
tarts may be so served, leaving only the venison, the chickens, the 



38 REMARKS ON DINNER PARTIES. 

fish, sauces and fondue for the day itself. Of these, nearly all can 
be cooking while the hostess dresses to receive her guests. Any sauces 
that are not immediately wanted can be kept in perfect condition by 
standing in stew-pans in which they have been made, in sauce-pans 
of boiling water, or better still, in a Bain Marie, which is a shallow 
bin or copper trough made to stand at the back of the stove and 
holding boiling water. In this receptacle for hot water everything 
may be safely placed until it is required, for the simple reason that 
as the water can never get hotter than the boiling point (212 degrees 
Fahrenheit), and as the contents of every sauce-pan will always be 
40 degrees cooler than the boiling water by which they are sur- 
rounded, no chemical changes can take place. 

A neat, careful housekeeper who will take the trouble to read care- 
fully the directions given for each dish, and use her wits, will easily see 
how to manage her time and her dishes so as to serve her dinner 
easily with the assistance of one servant only, and tolerably well 
without any servant at all. However, before showing what to do 
with the remainder of the dinner, a word or two may be said about 
the vegetables proper to be served with it and the directions for 
cooking them. See recipes for potatoes, mashed and brown mashed, 
asparagus and green peas. 

A CHRISTMAS DINNER. 

Christmas has ever been held a fitting season for creature comforts 
of all kinds. In cozy, good old-fashioned houses the* prudent matron 
makes bountiful preparation for half the year through. The pickles 
and preserves are made in the summer time, and are all carefully 
planned to be in good condition by Christmas. The home-made 
wine and beer are racked and fined and got ready for use on the 
same festive time, and for weeks before the day there is an air of 
pleasant anticipation of the occasion. It is indeed a time when 
extra care and extra plenty are truly desirable ; it is the one period 
in the year when people in middle life, long parted from friends of 
their youth by the world's accidents, make sure of seeing some of 
them again. The children are home from distant schools ; those 
who are married must needs eat their Christmas dinner under the 
old roof at least until their own covers too many olive branches to 
be hastily forsaken ; and hospitality on that day generally includes 
two or three of the lonely ones of earth, who, but for the fore- 
thought of friends, would have their sad recollections for company. 
So the kind housewife, on " hospitality intent," has much to per- 
form, to do the honors of her home, as everybody has some little 
individual taste she can gratify, and the more thoroughly she tries to 
do this the happier she will be. 



A CHRISTMAS DINNER. 39 

There is no reason why very much should be left to be done on 
the day itself. Mince-meat for pies may be made months before 
and kept in a good stone jar witn a closely fitting stone cover. The 
plum pudding may also have been made and boiled at least a week 
previously. The mince pies should be made the day before; so 
should the force meats for stuffing turkeys, and all the gravies and 
many of the sauces. The roasting of meat must, of course, be done 
on the day, and the pudding will want an hour's hard boiling, the 
gravies warming up, and so on ; but there is no reason why the 
work of entertaining a large party should not be spread out over 
several previous days, not one of which will be over-burthened. 
Now for the Christmas dinner, from which, if you are wise, you 
will omit both soup and fish, for two reasons (both are excellent 
ones) : the first is that the children, young and old, should all be at 
table if possible, and they do not care for or know how to manage 
soup ; and the second is the comfort of the servants. If, according 
to the old homely fashion never so good a fashion as on this, the 
best of all days, they eat at your table, and do not change about ; 
if you are able to have a number of them and they dine away, which 
in that case is of course only proper, then it will be well to give 
them as little trouble as you can. However, the dinner to be de- 
scribed is a wholesome, plentiful family meal, to which father and 
mother and children, friends and relatives, may all sit down together, 
and so may the servants if only one or two. The table, when spread 
for a large dinner party, such as will be described, shall have at the 
top a large roast turkey, stuffed with fine force-meats and garnished 
with sausages what our English ancestors called " an alderman in 
chains," and flanked by a tureen of delicate snow-white bread sauce 
on the left side and another of brown gravy on the right. At the 
bottom a fine piece of roast beef done to a turn, smoking 
hot, on a hot dish, with a well to it to hold the gravy, and supported 
on the right side by a tureen of hot horse-raddish sauce, on the 
other by a dish of light Yorkshire pudding. On the right side of 
the table should be a couple of boiled fowls with a tureen of parsley 
sauce behind them, and on the left side a boiled ham, or better still, 
a leg of pickled pork. With this course of savory dishes, mealy, 
boiled potatoes, two delicately brown ones, which have been baked 
with the beef for half an hour or so ; one of nicely mashed potatoes 
and of potatoes in their jackets, which old-fashioned folks always 
like ; in addition, there must be boiled cabbage, cauliflower, aspara- 
gus, peas and mashed turnips, beets, salsify and carrots. So equip- 
ped, you are abundantly prepared to entertain twenty or more guests, 
but if your party be very large have a second turkey ready to be 
brought on the table when the first is used, You may not want it, 



4-O A CHRISTMAS DINNER. 

but no matter ; it is just as good cold. If all these things are hot 
and well-served, your guests will be delightfully comfortable, and 
your first course will last along time, plain though your fare may be. 
When this course is over, all the dishes must be removed, the cloth 
brushed and the table laid with at the top a large, handsome 
Christmas plum pudding, with a tureen of nice wine sauce. At the 
bottom, two dishes of minced pies, one warmed over and one cold, 
on one side, a dish of fritters. In the center of the table set cheese, 
celery and salad, and the dinner will go delightfully till the cloth is 
removed and dessert comes in. This may be turned into a set of 
three courses by prefixing here soup, boiled turbot or salmon and 
two or three side dishes. 

DISHES MADE FROM THE REMAINS OF A CHRIST- 
MAS DINNER. 

The cold venison will make hashed venison, steaks, venison cut- 
lets, minced venison, stewed venison, venison patties, and help to 
make a nice game pie. Lastly, the merest scraps of each of the 
foregoing viands will make the most delicious risoles. 

The cold plum pudding may be warmed, but will be better served 
cold on a glass dish in neat pieces about the size of two fingers, or 
it may be broiled, fried, baked and treated in several ways here- 
after to be described. It will keep a long time in a dry, cold place. 

The apple tarts and custards will give no trouble at all, being a 
great deal more dainty than when hot. The plain cold potatoes 
will make "pomme de terre a la maitre d'hotel," and form" the body 
of the mayonaise or salad dressing, and the cold mashed are invalu- 
able for risoles or for serving with entrees. 

SALADS. To use the cold smelts or cold fish of any kind, take 
the heads and tails off the fish, split thefti open, take out the bones 
and divide the flesh into small pieces or flakes ; then take one large 
lettuce head or two small ones, about twenty raddishes, one head 
of endive, one small head of watercress, a handful of any small 
salad and four large slices of boiled beet-root, wash the green vege- 
tables in lukewarm salt water for half an hour. Take off the large 
outer leaves of the lettuce and the coarse stalks of the watercress; 
chop the whole into small pieces, adding the beet-root, and put 
them into a clean cloth to drain. When quite dry add the cold 
fish, arrange neatly on a dish or in a salad bowl and pour over it 
following salad dressing : Take two large potatoes or four small cold 
ones, beat them to a paste with a wooden spoon ; add to them the 
yolks of four hard-boiled eggs, one tablespoonful of mixed mustard, 



A CHRISTMAS DINNER. 4! 

two heaped teaspoonfuls of salt and one teaspoonful of finely-mixed 
onions, four tablespoonfuls of the finest olive oil, and beat all to a 
paste with the spoon. When quite smooth add gradually eight ta- 
blespoonfuls of vinegar, stirring constantly all the time, which will 
make your salad dressing rather thicker than cream. If not thin 
enough, a little more vinegar may be added Last of all, to this 
quantity put one tablespoonful of anchovy sauce, and when the 
mixture is poured over your salad you may have no fear of the re- 
sult. 

To CURRY THE COLD RABBIT. Take one large onion, chop it 
small ; put it into a stew-pan with two ounces of butter ; let it stew 
gently until it assumes a gold color ; then add the pieces of rabbit 
that were left, just as they are, and let them get quite hot through ; 
next mix one tablespoonful of the curry powder and one tablespoon- 
ful of flour, with enough of the gravy left the day before to make 
them into a smooth paste ; add this to the rabbit and the onion ; stir 
all well over the above for five minutes ; pour in the remainder of 
the gravy ; let the whole simmer for five minutes more, and it is 
ready. Arrange some plain boiled rice around the edge of a dish 
pour the curry, which will be a good gold color, into the center and 
at once. 

To ragout the cold chicken, carve the chicken into neat joints, 
reserving all the scraps, bones and trimmings for after-use ; make 
2 ounces of butter hot in a frying-pan ; fry the pieces of chicken 
over a sharp fire for five minutes till they are a light brown ; lay 
them on a napkin to drain. Take enough of your strained soup to 
cover them ; thicken it with a tablespoonful of flour, i of mushroom 
catsup and i of port wine ; boil it ; arrange the pieces of chicken in 
a dish ; pour the gravy over them and place around a few small 
sippets of crisp dry bread. 

For the hashed venison, place the jar containing the slices of ven- 
ison and the gravy (as directed for ragout of chicken), in a sauce- 
pan of boiling water, and let it boil for half an hour; take the venison 
out and lay it on a hot dish ; put the hot gravy into a small enameled 
sauce-pan ; add i tablespoonful currant jelly and i of port wine to 
it ; give it one boil, stirring all the time to melt the jelly ; pour the 
gravy boiling hot over the venison and serve at once. The cold 
mashed potatoes of the day before maybe arranged like a wall 
around the dish and baked in a moderate oven for half an hour. 



Note. If the rabbit had not been already stewed a very different 
process would be followed. The flavors acquired in stewing render 
nothing necessary for the curry but the above. 



42 A CHRISTMAS DINNER. 

Either the chicken ragout or the hashed venison may be poured into 
the center, to the exceeding gratification of both the sight and the 
palate. 

To dress cold boiled potatoes a la moitie d'hotel, put 2 ounces of 
butter in a deep frying-pan or a stew-pan and add to it 4 tablespoon- 
fuls of gravy, i of minced parsley, i teaspoonful of minced lemon 
peeling and i tablespoonful of lemon juice ; stir over the fire till 
the butter is melted. Take the cold potatoes (about i pound all 
together), cut them into slices about one-third of an inch thick, lay 
them in this mixture, cover the pan and let them stew gently for one- 
quarter of an hour. 

Now, having got through our bill of fare, we will just follow its 
various items to the end of their career: In the first place you made 
3 quarts of soirb stock, of which 2 quarts were served in the shape 
of Julienne soup and the third used for gravies and sauces. Of 
the 2 quarts sent to the table you will probably find quite i pint left 
in the tureen, for, as ordinary soup plates hold only half a pint, it 
follows that if your tureen be empty, you must have committed the 
mistake of filling them too full, or your guests must have been 
gouche enough to require helping twice, neither of which occasions 
was likely to have happened in these days of refinement. This 
shall be strained away from the vegetables as soon as it comes from 
the table and put in a clean jar in the safe. It will make a capital 
gravy for your rechoufees. Of the smelts you will have at least four 
remaining. These must be laid aside on a clean plate. Of the 
side-dishes or entrees there will probably be one-half of each left. 
These should be lifted on to separate plates, and the gravy belonging 
to each strained and set aside in clean jars. There will also be at 
least one fowl untouched and most likely a part of another, about 8 
pounds of venison and a bone or two and a quantity of the sauces 
belonging to each. Don't be alarmed at the apparent waste: don't 
throw anything away ; put each sauce separately in a jar ; the fowls, 
duck and pudding on clean plates, and let the whole remain till they 
are wanted. For the venison you must pursue another rule. Decide 
how many people you will have to dinner on the morrow ; cut a 
handsome slice for each, just as it comes warm from the table ; lay 
the cut slices in a jar that has a close-fitting lid ; pour in enough of 
the warm gravy to cover them, and put the jar away. The rest of 
the joint must be put on a dry dish, and the remaining gravy, if 
any, set aside by itself. The cold fish will make a capital salad or 
mayonaise. The cold rabbit will make a delightful fricasee, a curry 
or a pie. The cold pigeons may just be warmed up by placing 
them in a jar and boiling the jar in water for twenty minutes, boiling 
the gravy separately and pouring it over them, 



SOUPS AND BROTHS. 43 



SOUPS AND BROTHS. 

The chief cook in the Pliny days of Roman voluptuousness had 
a salary of about $4,000 a year, and Mark Antony made a pres- 
ent of a city to the cook who prepared a supper that pleased 
Cleopatra. It will always occur, particularly in large families, 
that either on the dish or on the plates the refuse bones and 
fragments of meat are left. Every fragment of these should be 
gathered up. Nothing in the way of animal food should be thrown 
away such as heads, necks and feet of poultry, trimmings of nice 
meat, etc. ; vegetables, slices of stale bread, etc. If these are not 
called for in the household, they can be used in making soup 
for the sick and poor, who will, in the majority of cases, be 
thankful for this token of thoughtfulness on the part of the propri- 
etress of the house. Beside this, the skimmings of meat should be 
saved, and sometimes the boilings, which should be well seasoned; 
may prove very grateful to the family, and the bones, scraps, vegeta- 
bles can be added to it. This liquor, when boiled down to a proper 
consistency, will form a good foundation for many kinds of gravies, 
as well as soups. In order to extract all the juices from the bones, 
it is best to boil them first, then strain off into a soup kettle, and if 
any portion of meat remains on the bones cut off the bits and 
add whatever else you have with them into the kettle. Then stew or 
boil slowly from 3 to 4, or even 6 hours. It is best to do this the 
day before you wish to use it. It can be easily warmed over, or 
brought to a boil, when it will be ready for the table. 

Cloves were but little known to the ancients. Pliny appears to 
be the only writer who mentions them ; and he says vaguely that 
some were brought to Rome very similar to grains of pepper, but 
somewhat larger; that they were only to be found in India, in a 
wood consecrated to the gods, and that they served in the manufac- 
ture of perfumes. The clove is the unexpanded flower of the 
coryophillus aromaticus, a handsome branching tree, a native of the 
Malacca Islands. The clove has a considerable resemblance to a 
nail, whence they take their name from the Latin clovus, or the 
French clou, both meaning a nail. As in the case of the nutmeg, 
to secure a monopoly of the cloves and that the cultivation of them 
might be confined to Amboya, their chief island, the Dutch bribed 
the surrounding chiefs to cut down all the trees found elsewhere, and 
thus keep the means of supply wholly to themselves, by eradicating 
it from every other island; but it has now become naturalized in 
both the Indies, as well as in many of the South Sea Islands and all 
warm countries. 



44 SOUPS AND BROTH&. 

Basil is a native of the East Indies. It now grows well in temper- 
ate climates as an annual, as well as in warm countries. It is highly 
aromatic, having a perfume greatly resembling cloves. Its leaves 
are used in soups and salads by French cooks, with whom it is a great 
favorite. 

Coriander enters largely into the composition of curry powder with 
temeric. It came originally from hot countries. But it will grow 
luxuriantly in moderate climates, and is a valuable commodity for 
the use of confectioners and druggists, and is a most valuable car- 
minative. Its tender leaves are highly aromatic, and are employed 
as a seasoning for soups and salads. Its seeds are used in large 
quantities for the purposes of distillation, and also as seasoning for 
.pies, cakes, sauces, etc. It grows well in Virginia. 

Chevil. Although the roots of this plant are poisonous, its 
leaves are tender and are used as salads. Among the ancients 
it was made a relishing dish, when prepared with oil, wine and 
gravy. It has beautiful frizzled leaves, and is cultivated in Savoy, 
is a close headed, wrinkled leaved cabbage, sweet and tender, 
especially in the middle leaves. 

Vegetables add much to the flavor of soups and broth. All fat 
should be removed while cooking. Vegetables should be taken out 
of the soup, that is, if preferred. 

SOUP STOCKS. Allow i Ib. of beef for 2 quarts of water. Who- 
ever is engaged in the important task of cooking or preparing a din- 
ner, it is highly necessary to place all the ingredients to be used 
on the table before commencing the operation, so that no timewill be 
lost after using one article to look out for another. 

THE MEDIUM STOCK. Four Ibs. knuckles of veal or beef or two 
Ibs. of each ; any bones or trimmings of poultry, or fresh meat, 1-4 
Ib. of lean bacon or ham, 2 ozs. of butter, 2 large onions each stuck 
with 3 cloves, i turnip, 3 carrots, i head of celery, 3 lumps of sugar, 
2 ozs. of salt, 1-2 teaspoonful of whole pepper, i large blade of mace, 
i bunch of savory herbs, 4 quarts and 1-2 pint of cold water. Cut 
up the meat and bacon or ham into pieces of about 3 inches square, 
rub them on the bottom of the stew pan, put in 1-2 pint of water, the 
meat and all the other ingredients. Cover the stew pan and place 
it on a sharp fire, occasionally stirring its contents ; when the bottom 
of the pan becomes covered with a pale jelly-like substance add the 
4 quarts of cold water and simmer very gently for 5 hours. As we 
have said before, do not let it boil quickly. 

This (medium) stock is the basis of many of the soups after- 
wards mentioned and will be found quite strong enough for ordinary 
purposes. Boil 5 1-2 hours. 

WHITE STOCK, to be used in the preparation of white soups. 4 



SOUPS AND BROTHS. 45 

knuckles of veal, any poultry trimmings, 4 slices of lean ham, three 
carrots, 3 onions, i head of celery, 12 pepper corns, 2 02. of salt, i 
blade of mace, i bunch of herbs, i oz. of butter, 4 quarts of water. 
Cut the veal up and put it with the bones and trimmings of the 
poultry and the ham into the -stew pan, which has been rubbed with 
the butter. Moisten with 1-2 pint of water and simmer till the gravy 
begins to flow, then add the 4 quarts of water and the remainder of 
the ingredients. Simmer for 5 hours. After skimming and strain- 
ing it carefully through a very fine hair sieve it will be ready for use. 
Boil 5 1-2 hours. 

N. B. When stronger stock is desired double the quantity of veal, 
or put an old fowl in. The liquor in which a young turkey, goose 
or any other fowl has been boiled is an excellent addition to all white 
stock or soup. 

RICH STRONG STOCK. Four Ibs. of shin of beef, 4 Ibs, of knuckle 
of veal, 1-2 Ib. of good lean ham, any poultry trimmings, 2 ounces 
of butter, 3 onions, 3 carrots, 3 turnips, (if the weather is hot the 
turnips should be omitted lest they ferment), i head of celery, a few 
chopped mushrooms when obtainable, i tomato, i bunch of savory 
herbs, not forgetting the parsley, i 1-2 ounce of salt, 3 lumps of su- 
gar, 12 white pepper corns, 6 cloves, 3 small pieces of mace, four 
quarts of water. Line a delicately clean stew pan with the ham cut 
in thin, broad slices, carefully trimming off all its rusty fat, cut up the 
beef and veal in pieces about 3 inches square and lay them on the 
ham, set it on the stove and draw it down and stir frequently ; when 
the meat is equally browned put in the beef and veal bones, the poul- 
try trimmings and pour in the cold water. Skim well and occasion- 
ally add a little cold water to stop its boiling until it becomes quite 
clear, then put in all the other ingredients and simmer very slowly 
for 5 hours ; do not let it come to a brisk boil, that the stock be not 
wasted, that the color may be preserved. Strain through a very fine 
hair sieve or cloth, and the stock will be fit for use. Boil 5 hours. 

BROWNING FOR STOCK. Two oz. powdered sugar and 1-2 pint 
water. Place the sugar in a stewpan until it becomes black, then 
add the water and let it dissolve. Cook closely and use a few drops 
when required. N. B. In France onions burnt are made use of 
for the purpose of browning. As a general rule the process of 
browning is to be discouraged, as it is apt to impart a slightly unpleas- 
ant flavor to the stock, and, consequently, to the soups made from it. 

To CLARIFY STOCK. The whites of 2 eggs, 1-2 pint water, 2 
quarts stock. Supposing that, by accident, the soup is not quite clear 
and that its quantity is 2 quarts, take the whites of 2 eggs, carefully 
Separated from the yolks, whisk them well together with the water 
and add gradually the 2 quarts of boiling stock, still skimming. Place 



4o SOUPS AND BROTHS. 

the soup on the fire, and when boiling and well skimmed, whisk the 
eggs with it till nearly boiling again ; then draw it from the fire 
and let it settle until the whites of the eggs become separated. Pass 
through a fine cloth, and the soup should be clear. N. B. The 
rule is, that all soups should be of a light straw color, and should 
not savor too strongly of the meat, and that all white or brown thin 
soups should have no more consistency than will enable them to 
adhere slightly to the spoon when hot. All juices should be some- 
what thicker. 

CHICKEN BROTH. Cut a chicken into small pieces, remove the 
skin and any fat that is visible ; boil it for 20 minutes in a quart of 
water with a blade of mace, a slice of onion and 10 grains of white 
pepper. Simmer slowly till flavor is good; beat i oz. sweet almonds 
with a little water and add it to the broth ; strain it, and when cold 
take off the fat. 

CHICKEN BROTH. Skin the body and legs of a chicken and put 
all into water and boil with i blade of mace, a small onion and 12 
grains of black pepper. Simmer till the broth acquires a pleasant 
flavor. 

EEL BROTH. Set on with i 1-2 quarts of water, i Ib. of well 
cleaned eels, some parsley, a little thyme, a small onion, a few grains 
of black pepper ; let them boil slowly till the eels come to pieces 
and the broth good. Add salt and strain it. When done the whole 
should make i 1-2 quarts. 

FISH BROTH is very nutricious and light of digestion. It may be 
made of almost any kind of fish, the more thick-skinned and glutin- 
ous the better. The following are the directions: Take 1-2 Ib. of 
any kind of fish, set them on with 3 pints of water, an onion, a few 
pepper corns and some parsley ; let it simmer till the fish is broken 
and the liquor reduced 1-2 ; then add salt and strain it. Some peo- 
ple like the addition of a spoonful of vinegar or catsup, and if the 
bowels be in a healthy condition there is no objection to it. 

A BROTH MADE QUICKLY. Take off the fat and skin of a bone or 
two of a neck or loin of mutton, set it on the fire in a saucepan that 
has a cover, with 3-4 of a pint of water. Trie meat should first be 
beaten and cut in small, thin bits ; add a bit of thyme or parsely, 
and, if desired, a part of an onion. Let it boil quickly ; skim it 
closely ; take off the cover, if likely to be too thin, else cover it ; 1-2 
an hour is sufficient to cook it. 

BROTH OF MUTTON, VKAL OR BEEF. Broth and soup made of 
different meats are more nourishing, as well as better flavored. To 
remove the fat, take it off when cold as clean as possible. If there 
be any remaining, lay a bit of blotting paper or cap paper on the 
broth when in the basin, and it will take up every particle. Take i 



SOUPS AND feROTHS. 47 

lb. of backbone of veal, i Ib. of backbone of mutton, 2 Ibs. of lean 
beef, sweet herbs, 12 pepper corns, put into a clean saucepan with 
5 quarts of water, boil gently to 3 quarts. When cold remove the 
fat. If desired, add an onion. 

For thick mutton broth, proceed as for thick beef tea, omitting 
the rice. A tablespoonful of burnt sugar and water will give a rich 
color to the broth. 

MOTHER'S VEAL SOUP. Boil a small piece of veal in 2 quarts of 
water in which has been dissolved a tablespoonful of salt ; when the 
veal is done remove it from the water and put in the water 4 or 5 
onions sliced, boil 1-2 hour, then stir into this, sifting through the 
fingers, some corn meal while it is boiling ; stir it constantly. Pep- 
per and salt to taste. It should not be thicker than rich cream. 

CALVES' FEET BROTH. Take 2 calf s feet, 2 oz. of veal and 2 oz. 
of beef, the bottom of a small loaf, 2 or 3 blades of mace, 1-2 nut- 
meg braised, a little salt, in 3 quarts of water, boil 3 pints ; strain 
and remove the fat. 

BEEF TEA. Take i 1-2 Ibs. of the best beefsteak and cut it into 
very small pieces, then put them into an earthern jar without any 
water, or with enough cold water to cover the meat, or a wide- mouthed 
glass bottle set in a vessel of cold water and brought to a boil ; place 
the stone jar on a stove and let it come to a boil for 3 hours, when 
all the nutriment of the meat will have been extracted ; or let the 
glass bottle in the vessel remain on the stove and used when required 
by the patient. Both jar and bottle should be covered with a cloth 
tied over them, or with their tops fastened closely. Season, if ap- 
proved, but it is frequently only salted. It is best to make the plain 
jelly the day before wanted. 

SCOTCH BROTH. This favorite Scotch dish is generally made with 
the liquor in which meat has been boiled. Put 1-2 pint or i cup of 
oat meal into a porringer with a little salt, if there be not enough in 
the broth, of which add as much as will mix it to the consistency of 
harty pudding or a little thicker; lastly take a little of the fat that 
swims on the broth and put it on the crowdie and eat in the same 
way as you would hasty pudding. 

CLAM SOUP. Lay out 1-2 lb. of pork ; to this add 2 Ibs of potatoes 
and 2 onions, and boil together. When the potatoes are done open 
and add one can of clams, five crackers and one pint of milk. Let 
it simmer five minutes and serve. 

MRS. MINER'S CLAM SOUP. Take 30 good-sized clams, boil in as 
little water as will open the shells, strain the liquor and add equal 
quantity of sweet milk ; boil together. Season with pepper and 
whole cloves, rubbed together after adding butter and flour to 
thicken the milk ; chop the clams fine, and just before serving add 
them to the boiling liquor. 



48 SOUPS AND BROTHS. 

CLAM SOUP (Mrs. Carpenter). Cut salt pork in very small squares 
and fry them a light brown ; add i large or 2 small onions cut very 
fine and cook about 10 minutes ; add 2 quarts of water and i of 
raw potatoes sliced ; let it boil. Then add i can of clams ; mix i 
tablespoonful of flour and water, put it with i pint of milk and pour 
into the soup, and let it boil 5 minutes. Beef, pepper, salt and 
Worcestershire sauce to taste. 

VIRGINIA OYSTER SOUP. Take 2 quarts of strong, clear broth, 
whether of fish or meat; add to it the hard part of a quart of fresh, 
juicy oysters, previously well pounded in a mortar and the hard 
boiled yolks of 6 eggs ; simmer for half an hour and strain into a 
fresh stewpan, in which have the oysters cleared of the beards and 
very nicely washed from shells and sands. Season with mace and 
cayenne and let the oysters simmer for 8 minutes, when the yolks of 
3 eggs well beaten may be stirred into a little soup and gradually 
mix with the whole quantity, throwing aside the stewpan and con- 
stantly stirring lest they curdle. When smooth and thick serve in a 
tureen and stir the soup for a few minutes to prevent curdling. Any 
other flavor that is wished may be given to the luscious soup. 

OYSTER SOUP. Strain the liquor from 100 oysters and carefully 
remove any bits of shell or particle of seaweed. To every pint of 
oyster liquor allow an equal quantity of rich milk. Season it with 
white pepper and some blades of mace. Add a head of celery 
washed, scraped and minced small. Put the whole into a soup pot 
and boil and skim it well. When it boils put in the oysters. Also 
1-4 of a Ib. of fresh butter; divide into 4 pieces each piece rolled in 
flour. Boil 6 eggs hard and crumble the yolks into the soup. After 
the oysters are in give them but one boil up, just sufficient to plump 
them. If boiled longer they will shrink and shrivel and. lose their 
taste. Take them all out and set them away to cool. When the 
soup is done place in the bottom of the tureen some square pieces 
of nicely toasted bread cut into dice, and pour on the soup ; grate in 
a nutmeg and then add the oysters. Serve it up very hot. 

OYSTER SOUP. Put into some good mutton broth 2 large onions, 
3 blades of mace and some black pepper. When strained pour it 
on 150 oysters cleaned from the shell and a piece of butter rolled in 
flour. Simmer gently for 1-4 of an hour and it will be done. 

LOBSTER SOUP. Take out the meat from the claws, bodies and 
tails of 6 small lobsters ; remove the brown and bag in the head ; 
beat the fins, chine and small claws in a mortar ; boil it gently in 2 
quarts of water, with the crumbs of a French roll, some white pep- 
pers, salt, 2 herrings or a small portion of bloater paste, a large 
onion, some sweet herbs and a little piece of lemon peel grated will 
add to the goodness of the whole. Then strain it off, beat the spawn 



SOUPS AND BROTHS. 49 

in a mortar with a little butter, 1-4 of a nutmeg grated and a tea- 
spoonful of flour, to which add a quart of cream. Cut the tails in 
pieces and boil them with the cream and soup. Serve it with force 
meat balls made of the residue of the lobsters, mace, pepper, salt, 
some bread crumbs and i or 2 eggs ; the balls should be made of 
flour and heated in the soup. 

CRAB SOUP (Creole). Take 12 or more young, raw and fat crabs, 
open and clean them and cut them in two. Parboil and pick the 
meat from the claws and the fat from the top shell; scald 1 8 ripe 
tomatoes ; skin and squeeze the pulp from the seed and chop it fine, 
scald the seeds and juice; use it for making the soup. Put 3 or 4 
large onions into the soup pot for a short time, i clove of garlic in 
i spoonful of butter, 2 spoonfuls of lard. After stewing a few min- 
utes add the meat from the crab claws, then the crabs, and last the 
fat from the back shell of the crab, sift over it grated bread crumbs 
or cracker dust. Season with salt, black pepper, parsley, sweet mar- 
joram, thyme, 1-2 teaspoonful each of lemon juice and the peel of a 
lemon, put in the water with which the seed were scalded and boil it 
moderately i hour. The onions should be boiled a little before 
used. Any fish of firm flesh can be used instead of the crab. 

SHRIMP SOUP. Two quarts of fish stock, 2 pints of shrimps, the 
crumbs of a french roll. Tomato or mushroom catsup, to taste, 
i blade of mace, 1-4 pint vinegar, a little lemon peel, pick out 
the tails of the shrimps or not, put the bodies in a stew pan 
with i blade of mace. 1-4 pint vinegar and the same quantity of 
water; stew them for 10 minutes and strain off the liquor. Put 
the fish stock into a stew pan, add the strained liquor, pound the 
shrimps with the crumbs of a roll moistened with a little of .the 
soup, rub them through a fine sieve and mix them by degrees 
with the soup, add catsup to taste with a little lemon sauce ; when 
it is well cooked put in some picked shrimps, let them get thor- 
oughly hot and serve. If not thick enough put in a little butter 
and flour. Cook i hour. Seasonable at any time. Sufficient for 
8 persons. 

FISH Sxock (for Fish Soups.) Twolbs. of veal (these can be omit- 
ted), any kind of white fish, trimmings of fish which are to be 
dressed for table, 2 ounces, the rind of 1-4 lemon, a bunch of sweet 
herbs, 2 carrots, 2 quarts of water. Cut the fish up and put it with 
the other ingredients into water, simmer for 2 hours, skim the liquor 
carefully and strain it ; when a richer stock is wanted fry the vege- 
tables and fish before adding the water. Simmer 2 hours. 

N. B. Do not make fish stock long before it is wanted, as it 
spoils. 

EEL SOUP. To 2 quarts of water put 3 Ibs. of small eels, a crust 



5O SOUPS AND BROTHS. 

of bread, 3 blades of mace, some whole peppers, i onion, a piece 
of carrot, some parsley ; cover the whole close and stew it till the 
fish is broken, and then strain off. Toast some bread, cut it into 
small pieces and pour the soup on it in a boiling state; 1-4 pint of 
rich cream may be added with a teaspoonful of flour rubbed smooth 
in it. 

GOOSE SOUP. In France, where soups form a considerable portion 
of the diet, goose soup is much appreciated, and if carefully prepared 
is excellent. The goose must not be too fat. Truss it if for roast- 
ingvand put it into a stew pan with 3 quarts beef stock, the gib- 
lets or a slice of lean ham, a leek, an onion, a carrot and a head 
of celery ; simmer very gently, removing the scum for 4 hours, 
then take out the goose and keep it hot, and the giblets, which 
may be stirred, can be used for potting, strain the soup, season it 
with a pinch of cayenne, and salt; simmer one-half hour, line the 
bottom of the tureen with hard toasted bread, then add 2 glasses 
of Madeira to the soup ; pour it over the toast in the tureen. 
The goose may be served with onion sauce or any of the sauces for 
boiled goose. 

TURKEY BONE SOUP. Take the turkey bones and stew for one 
hour in enough water to cover them, then stir in a little dressing and 
beaten eggs ; take from the fire, and when the water has ceased boil- 
ing add some butter, pepper and salt ; thicken with a very little flour 
or corn starch stirred in sweet milk. 

A LARGER .QUANTITY OF INGREDIENTS AND FOR SEVERAL PERSONS. 
Three Ibs. of beef, i bone, 51-2 quarts water, 2 ozs. salt, 2 carrots, 
10 ozs. ; 2 large onions, 10 ozs. 

*NOTE Should any remain after serving this soup it could be saved 
to add to the sauce when the beef is warmed up. Break the bones 
when the soup is made and put the marrow with the fat skimmed 
from the soup all of it ; then stew it down ; all the sediments will 
go to the bottom and the grease will cease to crack when all the wa- 
ter is out and the grease clarified; then strain through a fine sieve 
and put away for frying. 

Ox TAIL SOUP. Take 2 ox tails, cut them at the Joints, and 
then cut them in small pieces as near of a size as possible; blanch, 
dra>n and put them in a stew pan with i gallon of rich broth, one 
onion, with 2 cloves stuck in it ; i fagot; boil, then simmer till the 
tails are cooked, turn 20 small carrots into a pan shape, boil them in 
the soup and glaze them. Boil and glaze 20 small button onions; 
when the tails are cooked drain in a collander, clean each piece, put 
them in a soup tureen together with the carrots and onions, pour 
over 2 quarts of boiling veal soup and serve. 

SOUP WITH MARROW DUMPLINGS. Beat together 1-2 Ib. pure 



SOUPS AND BROTHS. 51 

melted beef marrow, 3 eggs and the whites of 2 eggs beaten to a 
froth ; add to this 3 pints of milk bread, of which the crust has been 
removed and have soaked in water and then pressed out together 
with some nutmeg and salt. Out of this composition make with 
the hands small, round dumplings about the size of hazel nuts, put 
them in i 1-2 gallons liquid from soup stock, boil the whole 
slowly for 1-4 hour, when the soup can be dished up. 

CLEAR MOCK TURTLE SOUP. Prepare as above, omitting the 
flour ; strain the broth and clarify it with i Ib. of veal pounded in a 
mortar, with 2 whites of eggs ; finish the soup as in the preceding 
lecipe. 

MOCK TURTLE SOUP (the Slock.) One calf s head, 2 gallons water, 
2 ounces butter, 2 onions, 2 turnips, 2 carrots, 2 heads celery, bunch of 
herbs, 7 Ibs. beef, 8 cloves, 2 shallots, i teaspoonful black pepper, i 
teaspoonful allspice For this rich and useful soup always required 
at a handsome dinner, several tried and approved receipts are given- 
Take a calf's head with the skin on, remove the brains and lay them 
aside ; wash the head in cold water, in which it may be for i hour ; 
then put it into a stew parf with 2 gallons of cold water and let it 
boil gently for i hour, removing the scum gradually; then take it out 
of the broth and let it remain to be 1-2 cold, when the meat must be 
cut from the bones into square pieces of about an inch ; the skin, 
which is the prime part, should have the fat left adhering to it; the 
tongue must be cut up in the same way. 

Put into a stock pot 2 ounces of butter, and 2 good sized onions 
sliced ; shake them over the fire till brown, then place over them 5 
Ibs. of coarse, lean beef and pour over 1-2 of the broth in which 
the head has been boiled. Let it boil till all the scum be removed, 
then add 2 carrots, 2 turnips, 2 heads of celery, 8 cloves, 2 shallots 
and a bunch of savory, thyme, marjoram and basil, with 3 sprigs of 
fresh parsley and a teaspoonful of black pepper, and i teaspoonful 
allspice. Add the bones and the trimmings of the head, and the 
remainder of the broth, and let all stew gently for 4 hours, then strain 
off. This is the stock. 

THICKENING. Six ounces butter, 6 ounces flour, 1-4 lemon peel, 
1-4 ounce shallois, 1-4 ounce sage, 1-4 ounce savory. Put 6 ounces 
of butter into a clean stew pan and gradually blend with it 6 ounces 
of flour; smooth it by adding 1-2 pint of the stock. In another pan 
put 1-2 pint of stock with 1-4 ounce each of grated lemon peel, 
shallots, sage and savory. Boil for 1-2 hour, strain, and rub the herbs 
through a tammy cloth; then blend the liquor with the thickening 
and strain all into the stock. Let it simmer over the fire for an hour 
with the squares of meat added, and then make ready the seasoning, 
as below. 



52 SOUPS AND BROTHS. 

SEASONING. Two teaspoonfuls lemon juice, 2 teaspoonfuls mush- 
room catsup, i teaspoonful essence of anchovy, a pinch of cayenne, 
thin peel of i lemon, i pint of Madeira. The seasoning to be added 
must be 2 teaspoonfuls of lemon juice, 2 of mushroom catsup and 

1 of anchovies ; the thin peel of a lemon and a pint of Madeira or 
sherry. Simmer 5 minutes, take out the lemon peel, then add the 
quenelles as for turtle soup, and if required brain balls and egg balls, 
as in the following receipts and the soup is ready for the tureen. It 
can be reduced by boiling to 4 or 5 quarts. 

MULLAGATAWNY SOUP, or MuLLAQHEE TAWNiE SOUP. This cel- 
ebrated soup, in such great favor with all who have resided long in 
India, owes its peculiar flavor to the currie powder with which it is 
invariably seasoned, .though it may be varied by attention to the 
following tried receipts: Ingredients veal, 4 Ibs. ; black pepper, 12 
corns; allspice, 12 corns; water, 2 quarts, 4 onions, 2 tablespoon- 
fuls currie powder, 2 tablespoonfuls flour, i teaspoonful salt. This 
is Dr. Kitchmier's good though old fashioned receipt. Cut 4 Ibs. 
of a breast of veal into pieces about 2 inches by i, put the trimmings 
into a stew pan with 12 corns of black pepper, 12 corns allspice and 

2 quarts water ; when it boils skim it and let it continue to boil i 1-2 
hours, then strain it off. In the meantime fry the squares of veal 
and 4 onions in butter till they are nicely browned, put the broth to 
them, put it on the fire, skim it clean, let it simmer 1-2 hour, then 
mix 2 tablespoonfuls currie powder, 2 spoonfuls flour and a teaspoon- 
ful of salt with as much cold water as will make a baiter ; stir this into 
the soup and let it simmer another 1-2 hour, then serve with boiled 
rice. 

MULLAGATAWNY SOUP FOR FAMILTRS. Veal 3 Ibs., 3 quarts of 
water, i carrot, i turnip, i bunch herbs, 2 onions, 10 white pepper 
corns, i fowl or rabbit, 2 spoonfuls currie powder, 2 spoonfuls brown 
flour, a pinch of cayenne, i teaspoonful salt, i spoonful lemon juice, 
2 spoonfuls cream. Take a knuckle of veal, about 3 or 4 Ibs. in 
weight, break the bones and put it in a stew pan with three quarts of 
water, a carrot, a turnip, a bunch of sweet herbs, 2 onions and 10 or 
12 pepper corns ; stew for 3 hours, then strain off the broth ; take a 
fowl or a rabbit, skin and cut it into small pieces. These must be 
fried in butter till brown and put into the broth, which must stew for 
another hour, then mix in a basin 2 tablespoonfuls of flour browned 
before the fire, a pinch of cayenne pepper, a teaspoonful of salt, a 
tablespoonful of lemon juice and 2 tablespoonfuls of good cream. 
Rub it quite smooth and mix by degrees with the soup, which must 
simmer 1-2 hour longer and then rubbed through a sieve and served 
with boiled rice. 

GAME SOUP. A very good soup may be made in the season by 



SOUPS AND BROTHS. 53 

taking all the breasts of any cold birds which have been left pre- 
ceding day. First pound the meat in a marble mortar ; then break 
the legs and other bones in pieces, and boil them in some broth for 
an hour; do the same with 6 turnips, mash them and strain them 
through a hair sieve with the meat that has been pounded ; strain off 
the broth in the same manner ; then put it into the soup kettle near 
the fire, but do not let it boil ; add thereto the prepared eggs and 
cream, stirring the same well with a wooden spoon. Be careful not 
to let it boil, otherwise it will curdle. 

PIGKON SOUP. Take 8 pigeons, cut down 2 of the oldest and put 
them with the necks, pinions, livers and gizzards of the others into 
4 quarts of water ; let it boil till the substance is extracted, and strain 
it; season the pigeons with mixed spices and salt; and truss them 
as for stewing ; pick and wash clean a handful of parsley, cloves, 
young onions and a good deal of spinach ; chop them ; put 'these 
in a frying pan with 1-4 ib. butter, and when it boils mix in a hand- 
ful of bread crumbs ; keep stirring them with a knife till of a fine 
brown ; boil the whole pigeons till they become tender in the soup, 
with the herbs and fried bread. If the soup be not sufficiently 
highly seasoned add mixed spices and salt. 

PEPPER For (West Indian). This should be made in an earthen 
pot, which always remains by the side of the fire ; have the contents 
simmer, but do not boil. These should consist of an equal admix- 
ture of fish, flesh and vegetables seasoned with chilis or cayenne 
pepper and salt; the only attention it requires being occasional 
skimming and the addition of a little water when it gets too dry. 
Anything and everything may be put into it ; and as it should at all 
times be simmering by the fire, a good meal is always ready for any 
guest that may chance to come uninvited. 

NOODLES FOR SOUP. Beat up an egg and add to it as much flour 
as will make a very stiff dough. Roll it out in a very thin sheet, 
flour it and roll it up closely, as you would do a sheet of paper ; 
then, with a sharp knife, cut it off with short rings about like cab- 
bage for slaw. Flour these cuttings to prevent them from adhering 
to each other, and then add them to your soup while it is boiling. 
Boil 10 minutes. 

BEEF NOODLE SOUP. To i slightly beaten egg, i dessert spoon- 
ful water, a little salt, add enough flour to make a stiff dough. Work 
it thoroughly for 10 or 12 minutes; add flour when necessary. When 
soft cut off as much as is necessary at a time ; roll as thin as possi- 
ble, sprinkle with flour, and beginning at one side, roll it into a rather 
light roll ; then, with a sharp knife, begin at one end and cut it into 
very thin slices, forming little wheels or curls. Lay them on the 
paste-board, and let them remain one hour to dry; then drop them 
into one quart of boiling stock and cook 20 minutes.

GERMAN NOODT.KS (Mrs. Heil Ross). Make up the desired 
quantity of flour with beaten eggs, a pinch of salt ; then work until 
perfectly smooth; roil, then cut through in sheets with a knife and 
boil until done, then pour off the water and add some butter and 
cream. Serve hot for dinner. 

BEEF SOUP. Three Ibs. of beef, 3 carrots, i turnip, i bunch cel- 
lery, 4 onions. 2 bunches leeks, tablespoonful salt, pepper to taste ; 
cut the meat into pieces the size of an egg, vegetables washed and 
scraped and cut in small pieces; put all into a large stewpan with 4 
or 5 quarts of water. Boil gently for a whole day. Let it stand all 
night ; carefully remove the fat next day and add a pinch of cay- 
enne pepper; make boiling hot. 

SOUP (Mrs. Pr.ce, Virginia). Always observe in making soup to 
lay your meat in the bottom of the pan with a lump of butter ; cut 
the herbs and roots small and lay them over the meat ; cover it 
closely and set it over a slow fire.. This will draw out the flavor of 
the herbs and roots and make the soup much better. When your 
meat is almost dried up fill your pan with water. When done take 
it off and skim it. Set it in a warm place just before you dish up 
your dinner. N. B. Ochre, nutmeg, cymblings (squash), Irish po- 
tatoes, cut up very small, put them in an earthern pot with water, 
some slices of lean, sweet bacon, sojne green corn, a few onions, 
parsley, leeks chopped fine, Lima beans, tomatoes peeled and cut 
up, a small bunch of thyme, a chicken, thicken with flour and'but- 
ter, wet up with rich cream'. Add salt and pepper. 

COLORING FOR SOUPS (West Indian mode). Pare 3 medium- 
sized onions or 2 large ones and brown them well in an oven, then 
chop them fine. This will give a nice color as well as flavor to bruwn 
soup. Shells of green peas dried in the oven till brown, not black, 
will color and flavor soup nicely. The shells, if hung in a dry place, 
will keep all winter. 

COLORING SOUPS. Some prefer it because the soup looks better 
to the eye. 

SOUP GOOD INGREDIENT FOR. i 1-2 Ibs. beef, shoulder part, 1-4 
Ib. bone, 31-4 quarts water, i oz. salt, a common-sized carrot, 5 oz. ; 
i large onion, 5 oz. with a clove stuck in it ; 3 leeks, 7 oz. ; i 
head celery, 1-2 oz. ; middle-sized turnip, 5 oz. ; parsley, i oz. This 
will make enough. 

SOUP (Mrs. Upshur, Virginia). i quart clams, i pint of their 
liquor, 3 pints of water, 1-2 slice of bread, a piece of butter the 
size of a nutmeg, 3 blades of mace, a few whole pepptrs and one 
bunch of sweet herbs. Cover it closely and stew 45 minutes. Strain 
it and add a cup of cream, which scald a little, before serving up the 
soup.

ASPARAGUS SOUPS. One quart can of asparagus in 1-2 gallon 
boiling milk, 4 tablespoonfuls corn starch, i of butter; nutmeg, pep- 
per and salt to taste. Heat the asparagus and strain through a coarse 
sieve, thicken the boiling milk with the corn starch dissolved in a 
little cold milk, add asparagus, salt, butter, pepper and nutmeg. Let 
all come to a boil. If the soup is too thick add more milk and serve 
very hot. 

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON FISHES. 

"The great deep" is crowded with inhabitants of various sizes 
and of vastly different constructions, with modes of life entirely 
distinct from those which belong to the animals of the land, and 
with peculiarities of design equally wonderful with those of any 
works which have come from the hands of the Creator. Experi- 
ence has taught us these facts. However, the history of these 
races, more or less, must remain forever in a state of darkness, 
since it is beyond the power of man to explore the depths in 
which they live, and since the illimitable expansion of their do- 
main places them almost entirely out of the reach of human ac- 
cessibility. 

The formation of fishes shows that they are in every respect 
adapted to the element in which they live, and there is no doubt that 
the form of the fish originally suggested the shape of the ship. But 
the velocity of the ship sailing before the wind is by no means to be 
compared to that of the fish. The largest fishes will with the great- 
est ease overtake a ship, play around it without any effort, and shoot 
ahead of it at pleasure. This arises from that flexibility which to 
compete with mocks the labors of art and enables them to migrate 
thousands of miles in a season without the slightest indications of 
fatigue. How wonderful. How adorably simple has the Supreme 
Being adapted certain means to the attainment of certain ends ! 

The principal instruments employed by fishes. to accelerate their 
motion are their air bladder, fins and tail. By means of the air blad- 
der they enlarge or diminish their specific gravity. In swimming 
the fins enable fishes to preserve their upright position, which act 
like two feet. The tail is an instrument of great muscular force, 
and largely assists the fish in all its motions, and in some instances 
acts like the rudder of a ship. 

WITH RKSPECT TO THI-; FOOD OF FISHKS. They are mostly car- 
nivorous and find their food almost universally in their own element. 
They even devour their own offsprings, seize upon almost everything 
that comes in their way, and manifest a particular predeliction for 
living creatures. They frequently engage in fierce conflict with their 



56 OBSERVATIONS ON FISHES. 

prey. The animal with the largest mouth is usually the victor, 
and he no sooner has conquered his foe than he devours him. 
Innumerable shoals or armies of one species pursue those of 
another species, and with a ferocity that drives them from the 
frozen zones of the poles to the burning regions of the equator. 
In these antagonistic pursuits and hostile combats, fierce as fatal, 
many species must have become extinct, had not Nature, whose 
tender mercies are over all its works, provided means of escape 
in proportion to the extent and variety of the danger to which 
they are exposed. Hence the smaller species are not only more 
numerous, but more productive than the larger. From instinct 
they go in search of food and safety near shores and in shallow 
waters, where many of their foes are unable to follow them. 

The fecundity of fishes has been the wonder of those whose 
attention has been drawn to it. The greater number deposit their 
spawn in the sand or gravel and some on seaweed. It has been 
estimated that the flounder produces millions annually ; the cod 
spawns upwards of nine million eggs in one single roe ; the mack- 
erel five hundred thousand, a herring ten thousand, a carp two 
hundred and sixty-two thousand two hundred and twenty-four, a 
perch deposited three hundred and eighty thousand six hundred and 
forty, a female sturgeon seven million six hundred and fifty-three 
thousand two hundred. Many of the biviporous 'species bring 
forth two or three hundred at a time, and their young, at the moment 
they come into existence, commence sporting around their parent. 

IN REFERENCE TO THE LONGEVITY OF FISHES. It is affirmed that 
they surpass that of all other created beings, and it is supposed that 
they are, to a great extent, exempt from the diseases which the 
flesh of other animals is heir to. It is believed that the most minute 
species has a longer lease of life than human beings, though the 
ages of fishes has not properly been ascertained. In what light so- 
ever we look at the habits of the finny tribe that migrate through 
the different tracks of the ocean and have their homes in the 
watery realm, in a solitary capacity or in multitudes which would 
baffle the skill of the greatest mathematician to number, they are 
alike wonderful to those who look from the thing created to the 
benign Creator, who is as infinite as immeasurable in wisdom, 
and consider with exalted admiration the sublime beauty, vari- 
ety, power and grandeur of his productions, as manifested in the 
handiwork of his boundless creation, and yet with due humility and 
profound adoration call him our Father. 

Fish as an article of human food in its nutritive capacity is infe- 
rior to animal, or what is called butcher's meat, and has ever held a 
secondary place in the science of gastronomy as a large element in

the happiness of mankind, and here I will give an extract from 
Beeton's remarks on fish. " Among the Jews of old it was very little 
used, a ! though it seems not to have been exactly interdicted, as 
Moses prohibited only the use of such as had neither scales nor 
fins. The Egyptians, however, made fish an article of diet, not- 
withstanding it was rejected by their priests. Egypt, however, is 
not a country favorable to the production of fish, though we read 
of the people when hungry eating it raw, and of epicures among them, 
having it dried." 

FISH, AND How SPREAD OVER THE COUNTRY. The spawn is put 
into balls of mud, which can be transported to any part of the 
country and put in pools or lakes, either large or small, but the 
small ones are the better. (This is a Chinese custom.) The fish 
are fed on a very singular vegetable which grows on the surface 
of the water and multiplies during the night time with almost in- 
credible rapidity. 

The larger fish consume in immense quantities a certain long 
coarse grass which grows wild in hot places or by the margins of 
ponds. This is thrown into the ponds, when the fish eat it at pleas- 
ure. Artificial ponds can be made almost anywhere in China. 

DIRECTIONS FOR CARVING FISH. 

In carving fish the following directions apply : 

IN CARVING SALMON. It is only necessary to take care to avoid 
breaking the flakes unnecessarily by attempting to divide them at 
right angles with the long axis of the fish. There is a great differ- 
ence in the flavor of the back or thick part, and the thin part. 

A cod's head and shoulders is a most troublesome dish to carve, 
because if well boiled it looks whole until touched, and then it crum- 
bles to pieces in the most trying way to the inexperienced carver. 
As in the salmon, so here, the thick and thin parts are not equally 
prized by all, and should be served according to choice, togeth- 
er with many other titbits about the head. Close to the back 
bone is the sound, the flavor of which is patronized by most peop'e, 
though not by all, as is the case with the liver also, each of whi- h 
should be divided into portions suited to the size of the party ana 
their respective wishes onj.he subject. 

Soles are carved much in the same way as Salmon, when they 
are of any size, but small soles are completely divided into two 
or three pieces by the knife, which requires a slight twist in order to do 
this with ease; ladies with weak wrists have great difficulty in 
effecting this seemingly simple operation, but some strength will en- 
able any bungler to do it ; yet a little knack will make up for the 



5$ REMARKS ON FISH. 

deficiency in this regard, and place the delicate lady's hand on a 
level with that of the most powerful man. The exact method, how- 
ever, can scarcely be described, and must be watched and imitated 
in order to insure its being caught by the learner. Some people pre- 
fer to remove the whole of the flesh in the same way as in carving 
turbot, but this only answers for the large soles. 

Turbot requires peculiar carving, because unlike other fish its skin 
and fins are thought a great delicacy. It is only necessary to carry 
the blade of the knife down to the bone along the middle, and then 
to make similar deep and clean cuts at right angles to this each way 
to the fins, a portion of which should be separated and kept with 
each square of fish, so as to avoid that hacking of the fins in pieces 
afterwards, which is by no means slight. When this part is not ap- 
proved of, it is very easy to leave the fin attached to the bones be- 
low. 

Mackerels are split at the tail and the upper half raised at that 
part from the bones, after which the bone is removed from the lower 
half of the fish, and that in its turn is served either in one piece or 
divided into two, according to its size. 

Many other small fish are carved much in the same way ; that is, 
either serve them whole or divide them wilh the knife into sections, 
according to size, the thick and thin part of the fish, and there- 
fore most people like to be asked which part they prefer. This being 
done, the knife is carried down the bone longitudinally and removes 
a thick slice of either or both, according to choice. 

VARIOUS REMARKS ON FISH. 

If lemon juice can be had fish cooked in almost any fashion 
should b'e served with it. It promotes health. 

NOTE Tomato or Worcester catsup is a substitute, but not a very 
good one. 

Fish affords phosphorous for the brain, which it needs. 

FISH, THE FLESH. -Is refreshing and often exciting, and as an 
article of diet it should be more common than it is, as it tends to 
purify the blood from the impurities it receives from partaking of 
animal food. If taken at the commencement of a meal it tends to 
promote digestion of those articles of food which form the more 
solid portion of the meal. 

RE-COOKING BOILED FISH. Cut into small pieces 2 Ibs. of cold 
codfish, scald in 2 cups of sweet milk, then stir together 4 ozs. 
of sweet butter and a tablespoonful of corn starch, the b'eaten 
yolks of 3 eggs ; pepper and salt to taste. Butter a dish, then 
put in first a layer of fish, then one of the starch mixture, and 



REMARKS ON FISH. 59 

thus continue, leaving the paste on the top. Bake 45 minutes in 
a moderate oven. 

TOM CODS. Are cooked very much as the smelts, not carved, and 
are considered the most delicious fish in the market. 

FLAVORING FOR FISH SAUCE. Take walnuts fit for pickling, pound 
them, let them stand for 24 hours, then press the juice from them, 
pour off the clear; to every pint of juice put i round of anchovies, 
set it over the fire till the anchovies are dissolved, strain it and 
add i ounce of shallots, 1-4 ounce of mace, 1-4 ounce of cloves 
and of Jamaica pepper with 1-2 pint of the best pure fruit vinegar; 
boil it 1-4 hour; when cold bottle for use. A large tablespoon- 
ful is enough for nearly 1-2 pint of butter. It will keep good for 
3 or 4 years. It is very good to put in brown gravies and hashes, 
One hundred walnuts will make about i pint. 

MODE OF COOKING FISH AT SEA, by French and Ilalian fishermen 
on the Mediterranean. The fish is knocked in the head, and with- 
out scaling or opening it the fisherman puts it over a clear charcoal 
fire or upon a gridiron, where it remains till cooked, basting it with 
sweet or olive oil. When sufficiently done, as soon as opened a 
flood of its own juice gushes forth, and the entrails having become 
hard, are taken out cleanly and thrown overboard. 

CODFISH. Should not be allowed to boil, as that hardens it ; 
remove the skin and place the fish in water, then cut it up and 
simmer till tender. 

To PRESERVE FISH FOR TRANSPORTATION. Take the fish fresh 
from the water and fill the mouth with bread crumbs saturated with 
brandy ; pour a little in the stomach ; pack in straw a short time af- 
ter and it will keep for 10 days. When wanted for use put the fish 
in fresh water. In a few hours they are ready. 

To REMOVE THE SCALES FROM FISH. Lay the fish in a deep dish 
or in the sink and pour souie scalding water over it, then take a knife 
and remove the scales at pleasure; then clean and wash your fish. 
Then cut up and put the pieces in the coldest water to harden them. 
Then boil or fry them for 20 minutes, then season them with pep- 
per, salt (oil if fried), lemon juice, chopped parsley and some grated 
nutmeg. Turn the fish over several times in the seasoning, so that 
it may be penetrated by it. 

FISH AS A DIET. Dr. Merryweather says: A fish diet is a great 
humanizer of the tempers of mankind. Its consumption tends won- 
derfully to render them more kindly to one another, and consequently 
'tames the passionate disposition to crime. As carnivorous animals 
are always the most fierce and violent, so become human beings who 
have carnivorous stomachs. Could such stomachs have an occa- 
sional respite by the consumption of fish, the world would be the

better for it. I speak as a medical man, and firmly assert that many 
maladies would be mitigated, and perhaps annihilated by such a pro- 
cess. 

HABITATION OF THE SALMON. Walton has styled the salmon the 
"king of fresh water fish." It has never been found in warm lati- 
tudes ; it lives in both .fresh and salt water. 

PRESERVE THE SPAWN OF FISHES FOR TABLE USE. (Miss Hap- 
per.) Pack them as fish in rock salt. 

HOW TO COOK FISH. 

CALADONIAN RECIPE FOR DRESSING FISH. Boil the livers of 
the fish and make them into forcemeat as stuffing balls, without 
meal, onions, pepper and salt ; put the water on with some cold 
butter and whole onions, and when the onions are sufficiently 
boiled put in the fish and stew them with their heads on, season- 
ing with salt and cayenne pepper ; add the balls also. 

BAKED FISH. After the fish is thoroughly cleaned, salt and pepper 
well, then dredge thickly with flour or corn meal by turning the fish 
in it ; cover the whole with lard by rubbing on with a spoon ; pour 
water over the whole, say about i pint. Bake in a quick oven until 
a nice, rich brown ; to be eaten with melted or drawn butter. 

BROWN STEWED FISH AND SAUCE. Boil the frsh in an ordinary 
fish pan, then make a sauce of 18 ginger crackers, i cup of molasses, 
1-2 cup of good cider vinegar. Moisten plentifully with the boiled 
fish water, throwing away the balance; boil till the crackers are soft, 
then pour it over the fish in the pan and let it come to a boil, then 
serve. Season to taste while cooking. 

To STEW FISH. (Maison Dore.) Put into a sauce par) either 
cold or hot water with a few slices of onions, carrots and a couple of 
bay leaves or more, according to the size of your fish. Thyme, 
cloves, whole peppers, some celery, a few sprigs of parsley chopped, 
salt and vinegar. Let cook gently until the flesh comes easily from 
the bones. To test it, have a thick needle, pass it through your fish, 
let it remain just a few seconds. If warmed thoroughly when you take 
it out the fish is done. 

BOSTON FISH BALLS. Eight ounces codfish, 3 ounces chopped 
suet, a small lump of butter, a teaspoonful of bread crumbs, pepper, 
salt and nutmeg and a teaspoonful of anchovy sauce. Pound all 
together in a mortar with an egg, divide into small cakes and fry 
them. 

YOUNG CODFISH ROASTED. Get the fish vender to dress -your 
fish, salt and pepper it, spread flat on a board and confine it with 
cords and stand the board up before a brisk fire to toast the fish; 



TO COOK FISH. 6l 

when sufficiently brown on one side untie it, and by means of a tin 
sheet or dish turn it on a gridiron, that the other side may brown. 
Do not break it in turning it over. Take up and pour hot melted 
butter over it and serve hot. Other fish can be cooked in the same 
way. 

To BOIL COD. Cut off the tail, which should be useless before 
the other part is done enough; rub well the inside, without 
washing ; let it lie from one to two days and boil in plenty of water, 
with a handful of salt; garnish with the boiled roe and liver, small 
flounders, king or pan-fish nicely fried. The tail cut may lay in salt 
for a few days and be boiled and served with egg sauce or parsnips 
mashed with cream and butter, or may be broiled fresh or fried in 
fillets or slices and served with oyster sauce, or a sauce made of 1-2 
a pint of veal gravy, a glass of red wine, 2 king fish chopped, white 
pepper, salt and a few pickled oysters and thickened with a little 
flour worked in butter. Boil up and skim the sauce , place the 
slices neatly on a dish and pour it around them ; garnish with slices 
of lemon. 

COD'S SOUNDS BOILED. Soak them 1-2 hour in water and vine- 
gar with some lemon peel or two bay leaves, pepper and salt ; when 
done cover it with a sauce made of melted butter, oysters, capers, 
a teaspoonful of vinegar and a little cayenne pepper. 

COD SOUNDS. They should be well soaked in salt and water and 
thoroughly washed before dressing them. They are considered a 
great delicacy, and may either be broiled, fried or boiled ; if boiled, 
mix a little milk with the water. 

FRESH CODFISH. Lay it in a kettle of cold water with salt and a 
bit of saltpetre, and boil it till thoroughly done or breaks in flakes. 
Serve with melted butter and any sauce you may prefer. 

MY WAY TO COOK CODFISH. To i bowl (i pint) of codfish 
picked fine, add 3 pints of cold water, put over the fire and heat or 
boil five minutes, pour off the water and add to the fish while it is 
hot i tablespoonful butter and 3 eggs, stir very quickly, and pepper 
and salt to taste Serve hot. 

COD A LA MAITRE DE HOTEL. Two slices of cod, 1-4 Ib. of butter, 
a little chopped shallot and parsley ; pepper to taste ; 1-4 teaspoonful 
grated nutmeg or rather less, when the flavor is not liked; the juice 
of 4 lemons. Boil the cod, and either leave it whole, or what is 
better, flake it from the bone and take off the skin ; put it into a 
stew-pan with the butter, parsley, salt, pepper and nutmeg. Melt 
the butter gradually, and be yery careful that it does not become 
like oil; when all is well mixed and thoroughly hot add the lemon 
juice and serve. Use the remains of cold fish; cook 1-2 hour. 
The employment of catching codfish is exceedingly fatiguing, owing 
to the weight of the fish. 



62 TO COOK FISH. 

CODFISH FOR FRIDAY DINNER. One quart of picked codfish, i 
pint of bread crumbs, i cup of cream, 1-4 Ib. butter, i teaspoonful 
black pepper ; wash the fish thoroughly and soak over night in cold 
water ; when ready to use pick it fine, put it in a baking-dish in layers 
with the crumbs and pepper, adding a little mustard, if you like it, 
over the top layer, which must be crumbed ; spread with softened 
butter and pour the cream or new sweet milk over the whole and 
bake 30 minutes. 

FRIED COD. Flour the pieces and sprinkle cayenne pepper on 
them and fry brown. Cotton seed oil is excellent to fry fish in. 

To STEW COD. Season it high with pepper and salt, and add a 
little wine and lemon juice, or some nice sauce with butter rolled in 
flour. 

To CRIMP COD. Lay small pieces in half vinegar and salt for 4 
hours, then cook them in any way you may prefer boiled, fried or 
broiledT 

CODFISH BALLS. Boil 3 Ibs. of codfish slowly, after soaking it in 
cold water the night before ; boil some large potatoes and 
.mash them fine; while warm, add a large spoonful of butter, in the 
'proportion of 1-3 codfish and 2-3 mashed potatoes, make it up with 
4 eggs and a cup of milk, then make it with your hand as you would 
a biscuit, about i inch thick, and fry brown in hot lard or salt pork. 
Boil some eggs hard and cut them in halves and put a piece in the 
center of each ball and send to table in a flat dish. 

COD'S HEAD was stuffed with a quart of oysters, onions and a 
bunch of sweet herbs, and the mouth firmly closed. From Crom- 
well's Cook Book. 

THE SAUCE FOR IT. Oyster liquor, 4 anchovies, sliced onion, 
melted together in a pint of white wine! This was poured over the 
cod's head ; a little nutmeg was then grated over the fish, when it 
was served up, and the edges of the dish being garnished with slices 
of lemon. Cromwell's Cook Book. 

CODFISH PUFFS. (Mrs. B. Receipt the same as for codfish balls 
put in an earthen baking dish ; smooth over the top and put on 
some butter, then in a hot oven to bake 

FLAKED FISH. Make a sauce by dredging some flout into 2 ozs. 
of hot butter in a stew pan; add 1-2 Ib. of codfish nicely flaked, 2 
spoonfuls of cold butter, a spoonful each of anchovy sauce and mixed 
mustard, i teacupful of cream, some pepper, salt and a few bread 
crumbs, make hot and serve as it is, or you may pour it into a but- 
tered dish with the addition of a few bread crumbs and brown the 
top in an oven. 

SALT CODFISH. Sufficient water to cover the fish ; wash the nsn 
and lay it all night in water with 1-4 pint of vinegar ; when thor-

oughly soaked take it out, see that it is perfectly clean and put in 
the kettle with sufficient cold water to cover it. Heat it gradually, 
but do not let it boil much, or the fish will be hard. Skim well, and 
when done drain the fish and put it in a napkin garnished with hard 
boiled eggs ; cut in rings. 

SALT FOR BOILING FISH. Allow 2 teaspoonfuls of salt to every 
quart of water; allow 15 or 20 minutes for boiling every pound of 
fish. 

In boiling fish it will sink to the bottom, and does not rise to 
the surface till done. When it does so it is a sure sign that it is 
sufficiently cooked. 

SOAP ROOT AND FISH. The Indians use this bulb to catch fish 
in very large quantities, finding the place where the trout collect 
together in a hole in some stream. They beat up the soap root 
and throw it in the water, which stupefies the fish and causes 
them to float to the surface of the stream, when they may be 
taken. 

Flying fish come in the spring and leave in the fall ; abound in 
the waters of the Santa Cruz coast. Cooked as herring. 

HERRINGS BOILED. Boil very slowly 6 herrings 20 minutes in 
plenty of salt and water, then make a sauce of 1-2 cup of sweet cream 
in a sauce pan on the fire ; when it boils add a small cupful of new 
milk and a spoonful of fresh butter, pepper and salt to taste, and the 
juice of 1-2 a lemon ; place upon a dish, pour the boiling hot sauce 
over and serve at once. 

FRESH HERRINGS BROILED WITH DIJON SAUCE. Herrings can be 
bread crumbed and fried, but they are better dressed in the follow- 
ing fashion : Wipe them well with a clean cloth and cut three 
incisions slantingly upon each side, then dip them in flour and 
broil very slowly, when done sprinkle a little salt over, place 
them on a napkin on a dish, then garnish with parsley and serve 
with salad, or the following sauce in a boat, made in a stew-pan : 
8 tablespoonfuls of melted butter, 2 tablepoonfuls of French 
mustard, or i of American or English, a tablespoonful of fresh 
butter, a little pepper and salt ; when about to boil, serve. 

BAKED HERRING. Scale, wash and dry them well in a cloth, 
lay them on a board, pound some black pepper and cloves to- 
gether, and mix them with 4 times the quantity of salt, and rub 
the fish all over. Lay them straight in an earthen dish (a deep 
dish is best) ; cover them with vinegar and a fe\v bay leaves. 
Tie strong paper over the top of the dish and bake them in a 
moderate oven for 1-2 an hour or longer. They are good eaten 
either hot or cold, and will keep a long time if well covered. 
Mackerel and trout may be dressed in the same way. 



64 TO COOK FISH. 

To FRY HERRING. If fresh, scale and dry them well, dredge 
them with flour and fry them in butter or bacon grease; when done, 
set their tails one against the other in the middle of the dish. Fry 
crisp a handful of parsley, take it out before the color changes, lay 
it around the herrings and serve them up with melted butter, parsley 
and mustard. If the herrings are salt, soak them 24 hours, hang 
them up to dry and fry them in lard. 

To BROIL FRESH HERRINGS. Scale and wipe them perfectly 
clean ; rub the bars of the gridiron with mutton suet or fat bacon ; 
have a clear fire, lay them on, and when nicely browned turn them. 
Serve very hot, with cold butter. 

To BROIL SALT HERRINGS, MACKEUEL, ETC. When taken from 
the brine wash them in two waters, and lay them in plenty of water 
and let them soak for 6 hours. If very salt, which can be known by 
tasting one of the fins, change the water. It is better to add 2 or 3 
teaspoonfuls of vinegar. But if the fish are hard and dry, use a 
tablespoonful of soda instead of the vinegar. When sufficiently 
fresh, take them irom the water and wipe them well and dry. Have 
your gridiron very clean by rubbing the bars bright, grease them 
with suet or lard, but not too much, otherwise the grease wil drip on 
the coals and impart a disagreeable odor and taste to the fish. The 
gridiron should be hot, but not enough so as to scorch them ; there 
should be no smoke or blaze about it. Lay the fish open, the skin 
sides down ; turn ft once ; when done, place over it a hot dish ; re- 
verse the gridiron ; pour 1-2 a cup of water over the fish. Let it 
remain 5 minutes; pour off the water ;' butter and pepper it well; 
garnish with hard-boiled eggs, sliced, or use egg sauce or season 
with lemon juice or any flavored vinegar. The dish should be 
served hot and sent to the table without delay. Worcestershire 
sauce is an excellent seasoning. 

FISH STOCK WITH HERRINGS CUT UP. Put the fish on in cold 
water; when done, pour the water off, put butter on a tin plate, 
then a layer of sliced Irish potatoes, chopped parsley and onions ; 
then put on a layer of stock fish and the herrings, then a layer of 
butter, pepper, salt, potatoes, onions and parsley, and continue till 
the tin plate is full, and let the last layer be of the vegetables with 
pepper and salt. Set in the oven and bake slowly. 

To STEW MACKEREL. After removing the head, the fins and the 
tail, open the fish and take out the hard roes and dry them with a 
cloth, then dredge them lightly with flour, place three of them in a 
stew-pan with a lump of butter the size of a black walnut to each 
fish ; put into a small basin a teaspoonful of water, a tablespoonful 
each of finely chopped onions and parsley, a blade or two of mace, a 
little pepper and salt, a tablespoonful of Anchovy essence, a small 



TO COOK FISH. 65 

teacupful of ale or porter (if not bitter) ; add a tablespoonful of 
grated bread crust toasted a light brown ; pour all these ingredients 
over the fish, and let them stew gently for 20 minutes; have ready 
the yolks of 3 eggs well beaten. When the fish is sufficiently done, 
take up some of the gravy and mix gradually with the eggs, pouring 
them on the fish ; shake the stew-pan a little over the fire to thicken 
the whole, but not to curdle the eggs ; the soft roes added are an 
improvement. Have ready more grated crust, and having placed 
the fish whole in the dish, shake a little of the grated crust over the 
whole, so as to make it of a handsome brown. If the gravy is too 
thick, more water may be added, also a glass of sherry ^if liked. The 
recipe should be carefully followed. 

SOUSED MACKEUEL. Wash the mackerel clean, boil in salt and 
water, then take it up ; take some of the boiled water and the same 
quantity of vinegar, heat very hot with some whole peppers and 
cloves, and pour it over the fish in an earthen or wooden vessel. In 
three days it can be used. 

FENNEL BUTTER OR SAUCE ESPECIALLY FOR MACKEREL. Mix a 
good tablespoonful each of butter and flour with a wooden spoon, 
so as to form a paste, before putting it on the fire, then add to it a 
cupful of water, with an even teaspoon ful of salt, a good pinch of 
black pepper ; set on the fire ; stir it constantly until it comes to a 
boil, then add a heaped tablespoonful of fennel chopped fine, stir it 
and set to boil a moment, then add a spoonful of butter. Serve hot 
in a boat. If desired a spoonful of vinegar may be added. 

BOILED MACKEREL. Boil in salt and water with fennel, parsley 
or any piquant seasoning. 

BAKED MACKEREL. 4 middling-sized mackerel, a nice, delicate 
forcemeat, 2 spoonfuls of butter, and pepper and salt to taste. Clean 
the fish ; take out the roes and fill up with forcemeat and sew up 
the slit, flour, put them on a dish, heads and tails alternately, with 
the roes between each layer, and put on some little pieces of but- 
ter. Sufficient for 6 persons. Mackerel die as soon as taken from 
the water. 

To BOIL HERRINGS. Having scaled and cleaned the fish, dry 
them well and rub them over with a little salt and vinegar. Fasten 
the tails in their mouths and lay them in a fish plate. Put them in 
the water as soon as it boils at.d let them remain 1 2 minutes. On 
taking them up, let them drain, and then turn the heads into the 
middle of the dish. Serve with butter and parsley and garnish with 
scraped horseradish. 

To FRY PIKE. Bone the Pike, cut the fillets in thin pieces, 
dip them in egg and crumbs of bread, fry in hot fat. 

BAKED PIKE. Scale the fish, take out the gills, wash and wipe 



66 . TO COOK FISH. 

it thoroughly dry, stuff it with force meat, sew it up, and fasten 
the tail in the mouth by means of a skewer, brush it over with 
egg, sprinkle with bread crumbs and baste with butter before put- 
ting it in the oven, which must be well heated. When the pike 
is of a nice brown color cover it with buttered paper, as the out- 
side would become too dry. If 2 are dressed a little variety may 
be made by making one of them green with a little chopped pars- 
ley mixed with the bread crumbs. Serve with melted butter. Baked 
more or less than i hour. 

To STEW PIKE. Make a browning with butter and flour and 
put it into tlje pan with a pint of red wine, 4 cloves, 12 small 
onions parboiled and some pepper and salt ; cut the fish in pieces 
and stew the whole gently. When done take it out and add to it a 
spoonful of capers chopped small and some walnut or tomato cat- 
sup. Boil it a few minutes and pour it over the pike. Garnish with 
fried bread. 

CREAM SAUCE FOR BAKED PIKE. A couple slices of onion, salt, 
2 ounces of butter and i pint of sour cream for 3 Ibs. of pike; bake 
it in a hot oven for 20 minutes ; during the time baste several times 
with its own broth ; stewed with bread crumbs and Parmesian 
cheese. When done mix the sauce with a little vinegar and lemon 
juice, pour it over the fish, taking out the bay leaf and slices of 
onion. 

To BOIL PIKE IN ITS OWN JUICE. It is better to dress it as soon 
as taken from the water ; the pike are scalded, drawn and cut in 
pieces or slices, then washed in cold water and put into a stew pan. 
Then pour over a glass of white wine, add a few onions, some bay 
leaves, salt, mace, some finely chopped anchovies ; cover it and 
boil it together for 1-2 hour. When you dish it up take out the on- 
ions and bay leaves. Put the fish on the dish and pour the gravy 
over it. 

CRIMPED SALMON. Salmon is frequently dressed in this way at 
many fashionable tables, but must be very fresh and cut into slices 
2 or 3 inches thick. Lay these in cold salt and water for i hour ; 
have ready some boiling water (6 ounces of salt to each gallon of 
water) and well skimmed; put in the fish and simmer gently for 1-4 
hour, or rather longer should it be very thick, garnish the same as 
boiled salmon and serve with the same sauce. Cook 1-4 hour, more 
or less, according to size. 

N. B. Never use vinegar with salmon, as it spoils the color and 
taste of the fish. 

SALMON CUTLET WITH CAPER SAUCE. Carefully remove the bones 
and skin of a piece of salmon, then cut it into slices 1-2 inch thick 
and flatten it on the chopping board with a cutlet but dipped in 



TO COOK FISH. 67 

water. Then cut these slices into uniform size, place them in a flat, 
well buttered baking pan, sprinkle salt and pepper over them, and 
10 or 12 minutes before wanted put them into the oven with a sheet 
of buttered white paper over them. Put all the trimmings of the 
salmon into a sauce pan with chopped carrots, onions, thyme, pars- 
ley, a bay leaf, a few cloves, some whole pepper : salt to taste and a 
little more than a pint of good stock. Leave this to boil gently till 
reduced 1-2. then strain the liquor into a basin and remove any fat 
that may be. Melt a piece of butter the size of a guinea's egg, add 
to it a teaspoonlul ot flour and stir it on the fire till it is well colored, 
Add the liquor to this and continue to stir until the sauce boils, then 
add a heaped teaspoonful of capers ; pour the same over the capers 
and serve. 

To BOIL SALMON. Clean it carefully, boil it gently and take it 
out of the water as soon as done. Let the water be warn) if the fish 
be split. If under done it is very unwholesome. Shrimp or lob- 
ster sauce. 

IRISH PICKLE FOR SALMON. Equal parts of vinegar, white wine 
and water. Boil it with white ginger, mace, cloves, pepper and horse- 
radish. Take out the latter when sufficiently boiied arid pour the 
pickle over the salmon previously boiled in strong salt and water. 

YORKSHIUE RECIP;-: TO DRESS DKIKD SALMON. Pull some dried 
salmon into flakes, have ready some hard boiled eggs chopped large, 
put both into a pint of cream with 2 ounces of butter rubbed up 
with a teaspoonful of flour ; skim it and stir till it boils, make a wall 
of mashed potatoes round the dish and put the fish in the center. 

To STEW SALMON. Half fry them in butter after cutting it in 
nice pieces, then take them out and put into the pan a quart of wa- 
ter and a sliced onion, replace the fish in the pan and let them stew 
gently for 20 minutes or 1-2 hour, according to size. When taken 
out squeeze a lemon over the pan and thicken the liquor with but- 
ter and flour. Having given it a boil, strain it through a hair sieve 
over the fish and serve with oyster and shrimp sauce. Several 
kinds of fish may be done in the same manner. Scraped horse- 
radish, sippets of bread and fine parsley may be served with it. 

SALMON CREAM. When you open your can pour off all the liquid, 
fill it with boiling water, seasoned with 1-2 a teaspoonful of salt; 
then set the can in a vessel of boiling water and let it heat through ; 
shred the fish, allowing i Ib. of fish to each pint of milk and 2 ozs. 
butter stirred into i spoonful of flour; boil the milk, rub the flour 
and butter together. If liked, boil an onion in the milk, then strain 
it out, then stir the flour and butter into the hot milk, boil till thick, 
season to taste with pepper and salt ; pour into a pudding dish, then 
some white sauce, sprinkle over some bread crumbs and thus con-

tinue till the dish is full. Let the last layer be of crumbs, then bake 
a nice brown on the top. 

To DRESS SHAD. One shad, oil, pepper and salt; scale, empty 
and wash the fish carefully and make 2 or 3 incisions up the back ; 
season with pepper and salt and let it remain in oil 1-2 an hour; 
broil it on both sides over a clear fire and serve-with caper sauce. 

BAKED SHAD (M. H.'s Recipe). Clean, wash and wipe the fish, 
which should be a large one; make a stufl&ng-of bread crumbs 
steeped in sweet milk, butter, salt, pepper and sweet herbs moistened 
with beaten eggs ; stuff the shad and sew it up. Lay it in the bak- 
ing-pan with a cupful of water to keep it from burning and bake an 
hour, basting with butter and water until it is tender throughout and 
well browned. Take it up, put it in a hot dish and cover tightly, 
while you boil the gravy with a great spoonful of catsup, a table- 
spoonful of browned flour, which has been wet with cold water, the 
juice of a lemon, if you wish to have it very fine, a glass of sherry 
or madeira, garnish with sliced lemon and water cresses. You may 
put the gravy around the fish or serve in a sauce-boat. Of course 
you take out the thread with which it has been sewed up before serv- 
ing the fish. 

MRS. HALE'S RECIPE FOR BROILINU SHAD. Empty and wash 
the fish with care. Do not open it more than necessary to do 
this ; fill it with forcemeat and its own roe. Oysters are good 
when in season ; sew it up ; fasten it with fine skewers securely : 
wrap it thickly with buttered paper; broil gently over solid coals, 
without the least smoke, for one hour Or one of medium size may 
be broiled on a gridiron in 20 minutes. Serve upon a hot dish, and 
lay a good piece of butter upon the dish. 

BOILED FRESH SHAD. Clean, wash and wipe the best roe shad, 
cleanse the roes thoroughly, and, after sailing both fish and roes, 
wrap them in separate cloths and lay them side by side in the fish 
kettle, covered with salt and water, and in proportion to their sizo, 
boil them for 1-2 or 3-4 of an hour. Serve upon a hot dish. Lay 
the roes around the fish and pour over drawn butter mingled with 
chopped eggs and parsley, or e_;g sauce. Garnish with capers, or 
'nasturtium flowers, or p >d<, and s : !ces of hard boile 1 eggs. 

To FRY SHAD. Clean them ihorougtyy ; cut in slices of the proper 
size to help at the table; wipe them dry. Beat one or two eggs 
well together, and with an egg-brush put the egg evenly over the fish, 
or the pieces may be dipped in the egg. Be sure that every part is 
covered with the beaten egg. Roll them in bread crumbs. Shak 
off the loose crumbs and fry in hot lard. Fry the thick parts a feu 
minutes before putting on the thin. Have plenty of lard to cover 
the fish. Do not put in till the lard boils, or the fish will not be firm 



TO COOK FISH. 69 

and crisp. If there are eggs or roe, fry them. Shad and other fish 
may be rolled in corn meal, sifted fine, or in flour, before being fried. 
Either way is good. This recipe will do for frying any kind of fish. 

SHAD AXD ROCK ROES. These may be fried in hot lard, or beaten 
up with eggs and fried in small cakes. If boiled, wrap them up in a 
cloth and throw th^in in boiling, and dress with butter sauce. 

BAKBECUED SHAD. Take a fine, large shad, put it in a pan and 
season with cayenne pepper and a small teaspoonful of sugar ; put 
one large spoonful of butter and lard mixed, on it, and a little salt. 
Mix vinegar and water, equal parts; and pour on enough to cover it. 
ilake slowly for one hour. 

PICKLED SHAD. Two gallons of rock salt, 1-2 gallon alum salt, i 
Ib. of brown sugar and 4 oz. saltpetre. This is sufficient for two 
dozen shad, if large ; then commence by putting first a layer of the 
salt, powdered and well mixed, at the bottom of the barrel, then the 
well-cleaned shad, the skin side downward, then another layer of 
salt, and thus continue till you have used all the ingredients, then put 
the salt last, and press the whole down with a board and weight on 
the top. Look at it in a week; if there is not brine, make some 
more and put it over the shad. N. B. If the fish is not clean it 
will draw flies. 

CORNED SHAD. Clean, wash well and split open a fresh shad ; 
mix i teaspoonful cayenne pepper and i of brown sugar; lay the 
shad upon a flat dish and rub it gently on the inside with pepper and 
sugar. Next morning broil nicely, and put bits of butter on it, and 
you will find it superior to salt corned shad. 

BAKED TURBOT OR SHEEP'S HEAD. Prepare a stuffing of pepper, 
salt, butter, a bit of fat sweet bacon, mince fine an onion, shallot, 
bread crumbs and the yolks of 2 eggs. After rubbing the fish with 
butter, and sprinkled pepper and salt on it, place it in the 
stew-pan or a long tin pan, bake it until it is thoroughly done. 

To BOIL TUKBOT. Must be for boiling in the nicest order and of 
the proper size; the fish must be set in sufficient cold water to cover 
it all over completely ; throw a handful of salt and a glass of vinegar 
into it, and let it gradually boil; be very careful to skim it thoroughly, 
so that nothing remains to mar the beauty of the color. Serve it 
garnished with a complete fringe 'of curled parsley, lemon and horse- 
radish. The sauce must be of the finest lobster, bloater butter and 
plain butter, served in separate tureens. 

TUKBUT A LA CkEME (Mrs. F. B. L.). Add by degrees a table- 
spoonful of flour stirred up with a small portion of milk till perfectly 
smooth, then gradually stir it into a quart of milk in a stew-pan on 
the fire, then put in a teaspoonful each of chopped onion, parsley, 
salt, some red pepper. Stir over the fire until it becomes a little 



7O STEWS, ETC. 

thick, then add a large tablespoonful of butter. Lay a little of this 
sauce on the bottom of a dish, then a layer of fish, picked free from 
the bones, alternately, until all your material is used up Sprinkle 
bread crumbs over the top and bake 1-2 hour. Any kind of cold fish 
will do. 

FttOGS. 

STEWED FROGS. After skinning the hind legs, parboil them a few 
minutes, then fry them a light brown in butter, after dipping them 
in flour. Chop a little thyme, parsley, a little pepper and salt, an 
onion or garlic sliced fine, mix the whole in a little wine vinegar and 
water and pour it on the frogs and stew till tender; add the yolk of 
one beaten eg-; to each frog and serve them hot. It is equal to or 
better than chicken, fur I ate them several times without knowing it, 
believing that it was the best prepared chicken I had ever eaten, 
while a passenger on an Oriental and Peninsular steamer. 

FRIED FROGS. Wash' the hind legs of some frogs, clean and dry 
them. Mix together some salt, pepper and finely-chopped parsley 
and strew the mixture over the frogs. Let them stand for a few 
minutes, then turn them in flour, beaten up egg and finely-grated 
bread crumbs in the same manner as calves' brains, and finish in the 
same way. 

EELS. 

STEWED EELS. Cut 2 Ibs. of eels 4 inches long, put in a stew pan 
with one large onion, some parsley, a teaspoonful of mace and all- 
spice together, 1-2 pint of port wine and 1-2 pint of gravy; a small 
portion of bloater paste, 2 spoonfuls of mushroom catsup ; let them 
stew 3-4 of an hour, strain the gravy, thicken it, add salt and pep- 
per with the juice of 1-2 lemon, boil it 5 minutes, add the eel and 12 
buttons of onions, boil till tender. Trout and salmon may be dressed 
in the same way. 

To FRY EELS. Clean them thoroughly, cut them in pieces, sea- 
son them with, pepper and salt, beat up an egg and dip the-eels 
therein, after which strew some crumbs over them, then fl< ur and fry 
them in butler or lard; strain them when done and serve them 
with plain butter, the juice of a lemon or parsley and butter; gar- 
nish with crisped parsley. 

CHOWDERS. 

CHOWDER No. i (Common sense.) Take i pound of salt pork, 
cut it into strips and soak in hot water 6 minutes, cover the bottom 
of the pot with a layer of this ; cut 4 Ibs. of cod or sea bass into 



OYSTERS. 71 

pieces 2 inches square and lay enough of these on the pork to cover 
it, follow with a layer of chopped onions, a little parsley, summer 
savory and pepper, either black or cayenne, then a layer of but- 
ter crackers, or whole cream crackers which have been soaked 
in warm water until moist through, but not ready to break. Above 
this lay a stratum of pork and repeat in the order as above : onions, 
seasoning (not too much), crackers and pork until your materials 
are exhausted. Let the topmost layer be butter crackers well 
soaked. Pour in enough cold water to cover all barely ; cover the 
pot, stew gently for i hour, watching that the water does not sink 
too low. Should it leave the upper layer exposed replenish cau- 
tiously from the boiling tea kettle ; when the chowder is thoroughly 
done take out with a perforated skimmer and put into a tureen. 
Thicken the gravy with a tablespoonful of flour and about the same 
quantity of butter. Boil up and pour over the chowder. Send 
sliced lemon, pickles and stewed tomatoes to table with it, which the 
guests may add if they like. 

CATFISH CHOWDER (common sense.) Skin, clean and cut off the 
heads. Cut the fish into pieces 2 inches long and put into a pot 
with some fat pork cut into shreds ;' a pound to a dozen medium 
sized fish, 2 chopped onions, or 1-2 dozen shallots, a bunch of sweet 
herbs and pepper. The pork will salt it sufficiedtly ; ste\v slowly 
for 3-4 hour, then stir in a cup of milk thickened with a tablespoon- 
Jill of flour ; take up a cupful of the hot liquor and stir a little at a 
time, into 2 well beaten eggs. Return thh to the pot, throw in 1-2 
dozen soda or butter crackers split in half, let all boil up once and 
turn into a tureen. Pass sliced lemon or cucumber pickles, also 
sliced, with it. Take out the backbones before serving. 

CHOWDER (Southern.) Fry in a large pot some pieces of fat pork 
well seasoned with pepper; when done remove the pork and put in 
some siices peeled onions, then some fresh fish, catfish, rock sea bass, 
codfish, pike or halibut, with a layer of sliced Irish potatoes ; add 
i pint of milk thickened with a little flour. 

OYSTERS. 

OYSTER CULTIVATION. Interior salt lakes are favorable to the cul- 
tivation of the oyster, and for this purpose the ancients resorted 
to them. To arrest the drifting ova, hurdles of brush, turf, walls 
of stone and enclosures of posts were used, as the ova will attach 
itself to anything by a calculus growth emanating from the shell 
itself. Tranquil waters are best. The French use sluices covered 
with a cement stuck in the oyster beds. They thrive better in a 
semi-tropical climate. The Lynn Haven bay oysters and Ceylon oys- 



72 OYSTERS. 

ters are the largest and best known, and might be cultivated with suc- 
cess in the salt marshes and peaceful coves, and salt inlets of the 
Pacific coast, as it is done on the Atlantic. 

To STEW OYSTERS. Plump, juicy oysters alone will stew to ad- 
vantage. When opened pick them out, beard and wash them in 
their own liquor and strain repeatedly. Put them into an enamelled 
sauce pan or one of bell-metal, with a little mace and lemon 
peel and a few pepper corns, a little butter kneaded in flour and 
a glass 'of cream or Champagne if for a high relish, in which 
case a very little parsley or onion, and cayenne may be added. 
Cover and simmer the oysters very gently for 5 minutes, lift them 
up with a silver, wooden or porcelain ladle into a deep hot dish with 
toasted slices of bread in it and strain the sauce over them. 

To STEW OYSTERS IN FRENCH ROLLS. Wash the oysters in their 
own liquor, then strain and put them in again with salt, ground pep- 
per, beaten mace and grated nutmeg ; stew these together for a 
short time and thicken the whole with butter. Cut off the tops of a 
few French rolls and take out as much of the crumb as to admit 
some of the oysters, filling them in boiling hot. Then set them ove-. 
a stove or chafing dish till they are heated through, filling them up 
with more liquor or gravy as the fish is absorbed. Serve them up as 
puddings. 

OYSTERS STEWED (home fashion.) Take i dozen large oysters in 
their liquor, bring them to a boil, add salt and pepper and a piece 
of butter about the size of a nutmeg, add 1-2 teaspoonful of spiced 
vinegar and serve with cracker and biscuit. 

STEAK WITH OYSTEUS. Cut the steak rather thick, brown it in a 
frying pan with butter, add 1-2 pint of water, an onion sliced, pep- 
per and salt, cover the pan close and let it stew very slowly for one 
hour, then add a glass of port wine, a little flour and a dozen or two 
of oysters, their liquor having been previously strained and put into 
the stew pan. 

To STEW OYSTERS. Open the can at the bottom, take the oys- 
ters out carefully, separate the liquor from the oysters and put it in a 
stew pan ; then adding with a sufficient quantity of milk, a lump of 
butter and a little black pepper and salt. Stir the mixture well and 
let it boil, then put the oysters in the pan until thoroughly heated ; 
then serve them up. 

CREAM OYSTER PIE. (B. S. T.) Line a pie plate with good puff 
paste, fill it with slices of stale bread laid evenly within it, butter that 
part of the crust lining the rim of the dish and cover with atop crust. 
Bake quickly in a brisk oven while still hot, dexterously and carefully 
lift the upper crust, and the buttered rim will cause it to separate easily 
from the lower. Have ready a mixture of minced oysters and thick 



OYSTERS. 73 

ened cream prepared according to the foregoing receipt, and having 
taken out the stale bread (put there to keep the top crust in shape,) 
fill the pie with the oyster cream, replace the cover and set in the 
oven a few minutes or until hot, and serve. This is a nice luncheon 
dish and not amiss for supper. 

OYSTERS ESCOLOPED. Put 24 oysters in a stew pan with their 
liquor, set on the stove ; when a little firm put them to drain upon 
a sieve, catching the liquor in another stew pan. Remove the beards 
from the oysters and throw them again into their liquor; add one half 
blade of mace, place again upon the fire, and when boiling add a 
piece of butter the size of a walnut with which you have mixed a 
teaspoonful of flour; shake over the fire until it becomes thick, season 
with a little cayenne and a pinch of salt, if liked, have an escalop 
shell well buttered and bread-crumbed, place the oysters in, sprinkle 
over bread crumbs or cracker powder, set in the stove 1-4 hour, pass 
the salamander over and serve. The yolks of eggs may be added 
and less flour. 

To STEW OYSTERS (A Maryland receipt.) Use no water, but 
cook gently ; stew in their own juice in a sauce pan. Allow a piece 
of butter the size of a walnut to every dozen oysters, pepper and 
salt, 2 bay leaves, a blade or more of mace ; simmer for five min- 
utes, add a gill of cream, shake them well together, turn them out, 
and as they lie in the saucer grate a little nutmeg on each oyster. 

STEWED OYSTERS (Mrs. Andrews.) Mix 1-2 cup of butter and 
i tablespoonful of corn starch, put the oysters in a porcelain kettle, 
stir until they boil and add 2 cups of cream or milk ; salt to taste. 
In stewing do not use the oyster liquor. 

OYSTER PATTIES. (Mrs. Orton.) Stew the oysters, take the broth 
and allow the yolk of i egg to every dozen oysters, turn off the broth 
and add the eggs ; let it come to a boil, then turn back the oysters 

ROASTED OYSTERS (Mexican receipt.) Collect your oysters from 
the bed and roast them over a quick fire till they become dry but not 
parched, turn them out on a metalic piate without any liquor, use 
no salt, add heaped tablespoonful of butter, set the plate over a bra- 
zier of coals or spirit lamp. When the butter is melted add a gill of 
Madeira wine and pepper to taste. 

ROAST LYNN HAVEN OYSTERS. While alive place the oysters in a 
shell upon a good fire (of coals is the best) let them remain till 
the shells begin to open, then take them off, open them on a plate. 
For seasoning use only pepper and salt. Prepared thus they are ex- 
cellent for delicate stomachs. 

BROILED OYSTERS. Wipe them dry, dip each one in the beaten 
yolk of an egg, roll in very fine bread or cracker crumbs, first sea- 
soning them with salt and pepper. Have ready pieces of well but- 



74 OYSTERS. 

tered foolscap paper, cut large enough to roll each oyster in a separ- 
ate piece, twist the ends securely and lay them on a gridiron suffi- 
ciently elevated to secure them from scorching till hot. Have ready 
the dish upon which they are to be served hot with a tablespoonful 
of butter; turn upon it the oysters, roll them in the butter and serve 
immediately. Use an extempore seasoning of cider vinegar, 
lemon juice, or celery vinegar, as may be preferred. 

NORFOLK RECIPK FOR FRYING OYSTERS. Dip the oysters into the 
yolk of an egg, and afterwards roU them in bread crumbs or corn 
meal and fry them in hot lard. Each oyster should be wiped dry 
before dipping it into the egg or bread crumbs. If gravy should be 
liked, pour a little of the oyster liquor in, just let it come to a boil 
and serve at once in a sauce boat. Gravy should never be poured 
over anything fried in bu f ter. It injures its appearance. Always 
choose the largest oysters for frying. 

SPICED OYSTERS. One hundred oysters, i dozen cloves, 2 dozen 
allspice, mace, cayenne pepper, and salt to taste. Strain the liquor 
through a sieve, put it into a sauce-pan, add the oysters, spice, pep- 
per, salt and 1-2 pint of good cider vinegar. Place them over a 
slow fire, and as soon as they boil take them up and pour them into a 
large bowl and set to cool. When cold, cover close. 

To PICKLE OYSTERS. Drain off the liquor from too oysters, 
wash them and put to them a tablespoonful of salt and a teaspoonful 
of cider vinegar. Let them simmer over the fire for 10 minutes, 
taking off the scum as it rises, then take out the oysters and put to 
their own liquor a tablespoonful of whole black pepper, a teaspoon- 
ful of mace and cloves. Let it boil 5 minutes, skim and pour over 
the oysters in a jar. 

OYSTERS A LA CREME (Mrs. Legeon) One quart of oysters, i 
pint of cream, put the oysters in a double kettle, cook until the milky 
juice begins to flow out; drain the oysters in a colander ; put the 
cream on in the same way ; when it comes to a boil, thicken with 
flour wet with milk, as thick as corn starch ready to mould; then 
put in the oysters and cook 5 minutes/ Serve hot on toast. 

OYSTERS BOILED IN THE SH^LL. Take large, unopened shell oys- 
ters, scrape and wash very clean. Have ready a kettle of boiling 
water on the fire; then, in a- dish have melted butter, with minced 
parsley, a lemon cut in two on a small flat dish ; carefully put the 
oysters, one by one, into the hard boiling water. Let them remain 
4 or 5 minutes, then pour off all the water by inverting the kettle 
over a large colander, then wipe the shells dry and send them to the 
table on a hot dish ; put a little hot liquid butter over each, with 
pepper ; squeeze over a little lemon juice before eating it from the 
shell. 



CRABS, ETC. 75 

BROILED OYSTERS. One quart of the finest and largest oysters 
that you can obtain, 1-2 cup of bread dust or cracker powder, sifted, 
i 1-2 heaped tablespoonfuis of melted butter, pepper to suit. Lay 
the oysters on a clean cloth and cover with another to dry them ; dip 
one at a time in the melted and peppered butter, turn them over and 
over in the bread crumbs and broil upon an oyster wire gridiron 
over a clear fire. The oysters can be turned when one side is done. 
They \vi.i be done in 5 or 6 minutes, then, in a hot dish containing 
the peppered butter, lay the oysters and send them to table hot. 

DEVILED OYSTERS. Half gallon oysters, some cayenne pepper, 
lemon juice, and enough melted butter to suit, 2 eggs beaten very 
light, i cup of cracker powder; wipe the oysters dry and lay them 
on a flat dish. Then mix the melted butter, cayenne pepper and 
lemon juice, and pour over the oysters, turn them irequently in the 
preparation, rolled first in the beaten eggs, and then in the bread pow- 
der; put in your frying-pan an equal proportion of lard and butter 
made very hot, then dip in your oysters. In the mixture pepper- 
sauce may be substituted for cayenne pepper. 

OYS i ;;R PATTIKS. Mince, with a very sharp, thin-bladed knife, a 
quart of oysters very fine, a large spoonful of melted butter in a cup- 
tul of new cream or milk, and thicken with a teaspoonful of rice 
flour made into a paste with cold milk ; salt and pepper to relish. 
When the oysters are thoroughly drained, mince them as directed. 
In the boiled and thickened milk, and the butter well pervading it, 
add and stir in the minced oysters, stirring constantly, and let them 
stew for five minutes. Having filled your shapes with a nicely- 
baked pastry crust, pour in your oyster mixture and set in the stove 
for 2 or 3 minutes to heat thoroughly and send to the table immedi- 
ately. 

CEABS, Etc, 

To BOIL CRABS. Boil them a moment; pick out all the meat, 
and, mixing it with a teaspoonful of salad oil, French mustard, cay- 
enne, white or black pepper and salt, serve it in the shell or on a 
plate. 

BOILKD CRABS. Take thirty of the largest crabs you can procure, 
wash them and put them into a suitable pan with 2 oz butter, a 
handful of whole parsley ; now pour over them a ladleful of boiling 
vinegar or wine ; cover the pan, boil the crabs 10 minutes, when 
they will have acquired a pretty red color; dish them on a napkin, 
ornament them with fresh parsley and send them to the table as hot- 
as possible. 

STEAMED CRABS. Cut up crabs. Have a pot ready with 2 or 



76 LOBSTERS. 

3 tablespoonfuls of boiling lard; stir in a handful oi onions cut fine ; 
when brown, stir in a couple of tablespoonfuls flour, then throw in 
the crabs and stir until almost dry. Then add enough boiling water 
to cover up to steam. Keep the cover on tightly until done. 

How TO COOK CRABS. Pick the flesh from the crabs, then make 
a forcemeat of 3 or 4 hard boiled eggs cut very finely, with some red 
pepper (the inside), that has been boiled and chopped, some salt, on- 
ions minced and half-cooked, then add the boiled and minced crab, 
the eggs, a little butter or sweet lard. Mix well and stuff the well 
washed shells of the crabs and bake it. 

To STEW MUSCLES. Wash in several waters, put them into, a stew 
pan and cover them closely. Let them stew till the shells open, then 
pick out the fish and examine under the tongue of each to see if there 
be a small crab, and if there is, throw it away. Pick out likewise the 
tough membrane under the tongue. Then put the muscles into a 
stew-pan, adding to every quart of fish 1-2 pint of the liquor strained 
through a sieve. Put in a few blades of mace, a piece of butter 
rolled in flour, and stew them gently. Lay some toasted bread in 
the dish, pour the muscles on it and serve them up. 

LOBSTERS. 

When this dish was to be served for. the table among the ancients 
it was spread lengthwise and filled with a gravy composed of corian- 
der and pepper. It was then put on the gridiron and slowly cooked, 
while it was being basted with the same kind of gravy with which the 
flesh was being impregnated. 

To STEW LOBSTKRS. Pick out the meat and put it into a dish; 
add a little butter, 2 spoonfuls of gravy, i spoonful of 
cayenne pepper or walnut catsup some salt, black pepper and a 
spoonful of port wine. Stew the lobster with the gravy. 

LOBSTER BOILED Boil it plain, then secure the crustacea, put in 
a dish or bowl and serve with a dressing of olive oil, vinegar or lem- 
on juice, salt and cayenne pepper, stir well, and a little chopped head 
of lettuce may be added. 

LOBSTER CUTLETS. Cut the lobster in slices, letting the flesh weigh 
about 1-2 lb., when done put in a pan 2 oz. butter, 2 teaspoon- 
fuls chopped onions ; put all on the fire, fry for 2 minutes, add 
1-2 pint of milk; season with salt, pepper and i salt-spoonful of 
cayenne, 2 teaspoonfuls chopped parsley ; let it boil for a minute 
or two, stirring all the time ; add your lobster and give it a boil ; 
add 2 yolks of eggs ; mix quickly, put on a dish to cool ; when 
quite cool and firm, divide in 6 parts, give each the shape of a 
small cutlet ; egg and bread crumb twice. Put a piece of the 



GRAVIES. 77 

very small claw to the end of each cutlet, so as to form a bone; 
fry for a few minutes, like you would a sole, in plenty of fat; 
lay on a cloth and serve on a napkin with plenty of fried pars- 
ley. You may adopt any shape you choose, if cutlets are too 
troublesome, as you would croquettes. No sauce is requisite. The 
lobster, in the preceding recipe, may be prepared, shaped and 
bread crumbed hours before wanted. 

LOBSTKR BOILKD. Allow r-2 a Ib. of salt to every gallon of 
water, and t^en put a number of the lobsters in one basket and put 
a weight on it to keep them down. Do not cook them too much or 
they may become tough. 

To BOIL LOBSTERS. As the dealers often starve them, by which 
means they are very unsavory, consequently, it is advisable to pur- 
chase them alive. Choose the most active, and of a middling size, 
but avoid such as have their shell incrusted, for it is a sign that they 
are old. The male is best to eat, and the female for sauce. Set on 
a pot with tablespoonful of salt to a quart of \\akr, and when it 
boils, put in the lobster and keep it boiling briskly for i-? an hour or 
i hour, according to size. Wipe off the scum and rub the shell with 
oil or buttter, break off the great claws, crack them at the joints, so 
as not to shatter them, cut the tail down the middle and send up the 
body entire. N. B. Lobsters are not good in spawning season. 

GRAVIES. 

To DRAW BEF.F GRAVY. Cup up any coarse beef as thin as pos- 
sible, put it into a stew-pan, cover it, put no water or butter in 
it, but throw over it a few grains of salt, put it at the side of 
the fire till the gravy oozes from the meat and -glazes on the 
bottom of the pan ; then pour in as much hot broth as will cover 
the meat, and let it stew until all the juice is extracted. This 
juice gravy may afterwards be enriched by seasoning, or flavored 
with herbs, but if not wanted immediately it should be set aside 
to cool, and the fat which may collect over it should not be re- 
moved until the gravy is wanted. 

ECONOMICAL GRAVY FOR POULTKY. Wash the feet nicely and cut 
them and the neck small ; simmer them with a little bread browned, 
a slice of onion, a bit of parsley and thyme, some pepper and 
salt and the liver and gizzard in i gill of water, until 1-2 reduced ; 
take out the liver, bruise and strain the liquor from it, then thicken 
it with flour and butter; add a teaspoonful of mushroom catsup 
and it will be very good. 

VEAL GRAVY is made like brown gravy, leaving out the spices, 
herbs and flour. 



78 GRAVIES. 

GRAVY WHICH GIVES VENISON FLAVOR TO MUTTON. Pick a stale 
wild fowl, cut it to pieces, after cleansing it, and simmer with as 
much unseasoned meat gravy as is necessary. Strain it and serve 
it in the dish with the mutton. 

GRAVY for fried chicken is made in the same may, only adding 
pinched parsley leaves, then pour over the chicken in a dish. It is 
very nice. 

GUAVY FOR WILD FOWL. To i wineglass of port wine add a ta- 
blespoonful of walnut catsup, mushroom catsup, tomato catsup and 
lemon juice, i shallot or onion, a piece of lemon peel and a blade of 
mace ; these should be scalded, strained and added to the pure 
gravy that comes from the fowl in roasting. The breast of the fowl 
should be scored in 3 or 4 places, and the gravy poured boiling hot 
over it before it is sent to the table. 

STRONG FISH GRAVY. After cleaning 2 or 3 fish, gut and wash 
them very clean, cut them into small pieces and put them into a 
sauce-pan ; cover them with water and add a little crust of bread 
toasted brown, 2 blades of mace, some whole peppers, parsley, 
thyme and sage, apiece of lemon peel, 2 smelts chopped fine and a 
teaspoonful of rasped horseradish. Cover closely and simmer ; add 
a bit of butter and flour and boil with the above. 

BROWN GRAVY? Lay over the bottom of a stew-pan as much lean 
veal as will cover it an inch thick, then cover the veal with thin slices 
of undressed gammon, 2 or 3 onions, 2- or 3 bay leaves or a sprig of 
sw..tt myrtle, some parsley, thyme, sage, mint, 2 or 3 blades of mace 
and 3 cloves ; cover the stew-pan and set it over a slow fire, but 
when the juices come out, let the fire be a little quicker ; when the 
meat is of a fine brown, fill the pan with good beef broth, boil and 
skim it, then simmer an hour and add a little water mixed with as 
much flour as will make it properly thick; boil it 1-2 an hour and 
strain it. 

CARUIKL OR BURNED SUGAR. The utensils used can be of no 
service afterwards. Any old tin cup or ladle is good for this pur- 
pose. White is better than brown sugar, having a finer flavor. Put 
2 oz. sugar over a rather sharp fire ; stir with a stick till it is black 
and begins to send forth a burning smell. Add a gill or so of cold 
water, stir and boil gently 4 or 5 minutes, take off, cool and bottle 
for use. It will keep for weeks, and may be used hot or cold. 

BROWMNG FOR GRAVIES, SOUPS, ETC. Lump sugar dissolved, 
2 1-2 Ibs. ; solid oil, 1-2 Ib. ; heat in an iron vessel until quite brown, 
then add California port wine, 4 cupfuls ; Cape wine, 3 quarts ; shal- 
lot, 6 oz. ; mixed spices, 4 oz ; black pepper, 3 oz. ; salt, 3-4 Ib. ; 
mace, i oz. ; lemon juice, 1-2 pint; catsup, i quart. This can be 
kept in closely covered jars or bottles to be used when wanted. 



GRAVIES. 79 

To CLARIFY DRIPPING. Put the dripping into a basin, pour over 
it the boiling water, in which a teaspoonful of salt has been dissolved, 
and keep stirring the whole to wash away impurities. Let it stand 
to cool, when the water and dirty sediment will settle at the bottom, 
and the grease rise to the top. Repeat this operation at least twice 
with fresh water. When cold remove the dripping from the water 
and melt it into jars. 

OSMAZOME is the essence or gravy of meat when cooked. 

To MAKE chestnut or almond gravy for any kind of fowl, allow 1-2 
Ib. of the nuts, blanched and peeled, to 2 coffee cups of rich veal 
soup, i cupful of new milk, a salt spoonful of salt and cayenne pep- 
per, 1-2 peel of a good lemon cut in thin shreds, and then chopped 
fine. Put all together and boil very slowly and gently until the nut 
kernels are soft; then force it through a sieve and pour in milk or 
cream, with spice, nutmeg and one beaten clove ; then let it warm 
slowly again when coming to a boil, stirring it all the time. 

GENERAL STOCK FOR GRAVIES. The recipes for custard sauce. 
Dutch sauce for fish or for pickling eggs, will answer very well for 
the basis of many gravies, unless they are required to be very rich. 
The stocks referred to may be made into very good gravies by add- 
ing various store sauces, thickening and flavoring. Spices, wines 
and flavorings should not be added until they are wanted, as their 
goodness, strength and a great deal of their fragrance evaporates if 
used long before wanted, as with long boiling the flavoring must al- 
most entirely pass away. A great deal is thus saved if this point is 
attended to. Shank bones of mutton previously soaked will aid 
very materially in enriching gravies. Trimmings of meat, beef skin, 
a smelt or kidney, etc., will answer very well when only a small quantity 
is required. A good gravy need not necessarily be so expensive, for 
economically prepared dishes are often found as savory, palatable 
and wholesome as more expensive ones. The cook should bear in 
mind that the fragrance of spices should not prevail over the gravies. 
The remains of most meat gravy should always be saved, as, when 
no gravy is at hand, a very nice gravy in haste may be made from 
it, and when added to hashes, ragouts, etc., is a great improvement. 

GRAVY FOR ROAST MEAT. Put a common dish with a small quan- 
tity of salt in it under the meat, about 1-4 hour before it is removed 
from the fire ; when the dish is full take it away, baste the meat and 
pour the gravy into the dish in which the joint is to be served. 

HAM GRAVY. When a ham is almost done with, pick all the meat 
clean from the bone, leaving out any rusty part; beat the meat and 
the bone to a mash with a chopper and rollingpin ; put it in a sauce- 
pan with 3 spoonfuls of gravy ; set it over a slow fire and stir it all 
the time, or it will stick to the bottom ; when it has been on for some 



8O TURTLES. 

time, put in some parsley, thyme, celery, some pepper and 1-2 pint 
of beef gravy ; cover it up and let it stew over a gentle fire ; when 
it has a good flavor of the bacon strain off the gravy. A little of 
this is an improvement to all gravies. 

GRAVY FOR FRIED HAM. After frying the bacon slices, take them 
up and have some new milk or cream to stir in the grease while hot, 
or it is best to stir in i teaspoonful of dry flour before adding the 
milk with a small portion of black pepper and a pinch of salt. Four 
this over the ham. Some like a little minced tops of green shallots 
added to the gravy. 

CLEAR GRAVY. Slice beef thin ; broil a part of it over a a very 
clear, quick fire, just enough to give color to the gravy, but not to 
dress it ; put that and the raw part into a very nicely tinned stew- 
pan with 2 onions, a clove or two, whole black peppers, berries of 
allspice, parsley, thyme and a small bit of sage ; cover it with hot 
water, give it one boil and skim it well two or three times ; cover it and 
simmer till quite strong. 

TURTLES. 

The mud tortoise and terrapins lay a great many eggs. Their 
flesh is often eaten. 

The river tortoise has a soft shell. Their flesh is much esteemed. 
They deposit from 50 to 60 eggs in one night on the shores of 
the Amazon. They dig with their paws a hole 3 feet deep in the 
sand to deposit their eggs, about 120 in number, cover them over 
with the sand, a second deposit, and so on, till the hole or pit is full, 
which contains 300 to 400 eggs, which takes 14 days. The turtle eggs 
are much esteemed for their richness and flavor. The soft flesh of 
the sea turtle is healthy and nourishing. The fat of many species, 
when fresh, is used as a substitute for oil or butter. 

The green turtle is celebrated for the excellency of its fat, from 
which turtle soup is made, which is only of recent invention. 

There are many other turtles whose flesh is tender, palatable and 
wholesome. 

SANDERSON'S RECEIPT FOR COOKING TERRAPINS. Put them into 
a pot of boiling water, let them remain until dead, take them up, re- 
move the outer skin and toe nails, wash the terrapins in warm wa- 
ter, boil in water enough to cover them till tender, adding salt 
to suit the taste ; while boiling take off the shells, remove the 
sand bag and gall without breaking, add any juice that may run 
out while cutting up, but no water; salt and pepper to taste, 1-4 
Ib. of fresh butter to each terrapin ; rub into the butter a table- 
spoonful of flour for the thickening; put these into a stew pan 



TURTLES. 8 1 

and stir well while the butter is melting ; add 4 tablespoonful s of 
rich, sweet cream, stir this in well, add enough good wine (M uleira) 
to give a delicious vinous taste to the whole. Stir frequj.uiy and 
thoroughly and serve very hot. 

TURTLE STEAK KEY WEST WAY TO COOK. (Mrs. S.M. Kellogg. 
Fry in plenty of sweet butter a whole or cut up turtle sieak, season- 
ing with black and cayenne pepper and salt to taste, when thoroughly 
done make a sauce of peeled ripe tomatoes cut up fine, put into a 
porcelain stew pan or one of granite and stewed down rich and 
thick, seasoning with a little pepper and salt to taste, then pour over 
the steak and serve very hot. 

NOTE If persons like it, some chopped onion or a little garlic 
may be added. When frying the steak and tomatoes are not in season, 
a rich cream gravy may be used instead. 

TERRAPINS How TO COOK THEM. (Mrs. D. Thornton, Cal.) 
Put the terrapins into a pot of boiling water and let them remain 16 
or 15 minutes, take them out and rub with a warm cloth all the skin 
from the head, neck and claws, also the thin shell as it becomes 
loose. Wash them in warm water and put in a pot of clear water. 
Add a tablespoonful of salt, boil them again till thoroughly done and 
the paws perfectly soft. This will take about 3-4 of an hour, and if 
very large i hour. Open them carefully, remove the sand bag, galls 
and entrails, but be very careful not to break the gall, as a few drops 
of it will spoil the whole, and as it is concealed inside it requires 
great care to avoid breaking it. Cut the meat of the terrapins very 
fine, put it into a sauce pan with the juice they have yielded in cut- 
ting them up, but no water ; season with cayenne or black pepper to 
suit the taste. For each terrapin allow a heaping tablespoonful of 
butter cut in small pieces and dredged with flour. Put the butter 
into a sauce pan with the meat ; add a pint of sherry or Madeira 
wine to every 4 terrapins, let it cook 15 minutes; serve it hot ; 3 or 
4 eggs boiled hard and chopped fine may be added when there are 
no eggs in the terrapins. Four good terrapins of the usual size 
ought to make 2 quarts. 

NOTE The French use the female terrapins only. 

TERRAPINS. Boil them until the bones can be easily removed, 
carefully take out the sand bag, chop the meat very fine and add 2 
tablespoonfuls of butter, i pint of tomato catsup, i gill of sherry or 
Madeira wine, i tablespoonful of mixed mustard, 2 onions boiled 
and chopped fine ; salt, black and red pepper to taste ; allspice and 
nutmeg may be used if "liked. Stir the mixture well, scrape and 
clean 2 of the backs, line them with puff paste, fill with the mix- 
ture, cover over with bread crumbs and bake until of a light 
brown. 



2 PRYING, 

To COOK TERRAPINS. (Arganaut.) Take 4 female terrapins, 
throw them into boiling water, boil till the" toe nails will remove 
easily, take them up, and when cold enough to handle, remove 
the shells, sand bag, the portion of the liver that contains the 
gall and cut them in quarters, or smaller, if desired. Take 1-2 
pint of soup stock, melt it and have ready the hard boiled yolks 
of 8 eggs, pound them fine, let them boil a few minutes in the 
stock, then strain over the terrapins. Simmer 18 minutes, add 
i teaspoonful each of salt, cayenne pepper, powdered mace, cin- 
namon, allspice, 1-2 Ib. of sweet butter, 1-2 pint of sherry, 1-2 
spoonful of cloves, 2 tablespoonfuls of flour. If not thick enough 
add more flour ; if too thick, thin with sherry. Cook till suffi- 
ciently tender. Add one pint more of sherrv and set away till 
next day. When wanted heat in a stew pan 

FKYING. 

Frying is, sometimes, a very convenient mode of cooking if done 
well; very agreeable as a change ; but, if badly-done, is one of the 
most offensive ways in which good victuals can be spoiled. It may 
be smoked for want of attention to the fire ; it may be .strong from 
the use of offensive dripping ; it may be sodden in fat from want of 
sufficient briskness of fire to do it properly, or it may be scorched 
and dried outside and slack in the middle, if the fire is too fierce. 
All these errors are to be avoided. 

The fire should be clear and brisk, and rather stronger than for 
broiling. The frying-pan should be thick in the bottom, that it may 
be less liable to burn. The fat should be sweet and fresh and clear ; 
free from salt ; either good lard or dripping, or, for somethings, oil 
or butter ; these latter, though very delicious, are very extravagant ; 
and there is scarcely any purpose for which good lard or dripping, if 
properly managed, will not answer equally well. If butter is used 
for frying, when the steaks are finely browned on one side, turn them 
and cover the pan, which will render them more juicy; pepper and 
salt as for broiling ; when done, place them on a hot dish by the 
fire or in a corner of the stove, and add what remains in the pan, 
a little catsup and a little good gravy, which boil up for a moment or 
two, and pour over the steaks. This is the usual mode for lamb or 
mutton chops. Garnish with green pickles or scraped horseradish. 

Lamb and mutton chops are sometimes egged and rolled in bread 
crumbs and parsley before frying. 

Pork chops may be fried in the same manner, dipping them, after 
they are egged, in a mixture of chopped sage, onions and crumbs of 
bread, with pepper and salt. 



BOILING. 83 

Veal cutlets may be dipped in egg and seasoned with a mixture of 
bread crumbs, parsley, lemon peel chopped or rasped very fine, pep- 
per and salt, and a scrape of nutmeg, a sprig of lemon, thyme or sweet 
myrtle, chopped very fine. 

When bacon is served with liver, let either be served in a separate 
pan, or simmered until the liver is nearly done, then put in the fry- 
ing pan a minute or two to brown. Each slice of bacon may be 
laid on a slice of liver, or around the edge of the dish. 

Eggs and bacon are a handy dish when a hasty meal is required. 
A little attention will render it a* nice dish. 

The details of frying fish, chickens, etc., and other modes of pre- 
paring dishes, will be specified in each recipe contained in the sec- 
tions into which they are divided. 

Cotton seed oil is excellent for frying purposes 

BOILING. 

REMARKS ON BOILING AND REDUCTION. To cook satisfactorily 
by boiling, a slow and steady fire should be kept up. All meats 
should be put into a vessel on the fire as soon as the chill is off the 
water. Do not hasten the cooking by indiscriminately heaping up 
the fuel. Once the boiling point is reached, all excess of heat is 
wasted. Meat should not be suffered to boil fast, as that hardens it. Be 
careful that it does not stop boiling, otherwise you deceive yourself, 
and find the meat at the expiration of the time underdone. The 
liquor boils away more rapidly with the lid off than on ; consequently, 
for producing quick evaporation, a brisk fire is indispensable. Im- 
mediately on boiling up, the pot must be well skimmed, or the scum 
breaks and settles at the bottom. A glaze or sauce, reduced too 
slowly, will lose at once in appearance and flavor. 

Vegetables should not be dressed with the meat, except carrots, 
parsnips or turnips, with beef, mutton or pork. As to time, every 
solid joint will require 1-4 hour to a pound ; a leg of pork or lamb 
will require 20 minutes to the pound. 

Families in which these savings are not necessary will do well, 
nevertheless, to practice saving the bones, coarse pieces of meat, 
vegetables, gravies, soups and cold bread for the benefit of the poor 
neighbors, and who can tell in these times of fluctuation and uncer- 
tainty how valuable habits of economy may prove to themselves ? 

To preserve the color of meat, blanch or scald it in warm water a 
few minutes before putting it on the fire ; or, 2d, shaking on a small 
dust of flour; 3d, very carefully skimming the pot. None of these 
methods should be avoided, even at a sacrifice of the juice of the 
meat, which is of far less importance than its color. 



84 BROILING. 

A-leg of mutton boils whitest when quite fresh. Allow time enough 
for the water to come slowly to a boil; if it is made hastily the meat 
is thereby hardened. Be careful never to run a fork or anything 
sharp into the meat, which drains its juice. When it is to be taken 
up have a very large, strong fork, of which set one prong into the 
shank bone, and slipping another urfder the end of the joint, take 
it up, pour a teacupful of the liquor over the meat, garnish with 
slices of carrot and serve with caper sauce. 

Sheep's head may be either plainly boiled and served with parsley 
and butter or caper sauce, or a little finely minced sage beaten up 
with brains. 

Bacon boiled requires 20 minutes to the pound, but the time va- 
ries according to the age of the animal and the manner of salting. 
Some people like greens, cabbages, etc., boiled with bacon. In that 
case the pot should be carefully skimmed before they are put in. 

Ham is best boiled in copper; it requires plenty of room and 
slow and regular boiling. If it has been long dried it should be 
soaked a night in soft water. When done, remove the skin neatly. 
But experience has taught me that to keep a boiled ham several 
days for luncheon or other purposes, it is best not to remove the skin, 
as that serves to prevent it drying and keeps it fresher. Garnish 
with nasturtium leaves, flowers or pods. No salt is added. If kept, 
put in a bag of thin muslin in a cool, dry place. Black or white 
pepper beaten fine should be boiled with it. 

BROILING. 

BROILING is the most important part of the cook's office. Meat 
thus prepared, if well done, is the most wholesome and generally 
the most acceptable to delicate or sickly stomachs. It is also in 
frequent request in preparing a hasty meal, or for a single indi- 
vidual, and yet it is an art in which few cooks excell. The first 
thing required is attention to the state of the fire, which should be 
clear, bright and perfectly free from smoke. The bars of the grid- 
iron or broiler should be perfectly clean and hot before the meat 
is put on ; let the bars be wiped with a piece of clean paper and 
rubbed with a piece of fresh suet to prevent the meat from stick- 
ing or being marked by the bars ; then sprinkle a little salt over the 
fire and lay the meat on. 

A broiling fire should be very equal, with the fuel equally lighted 
in all parts. 

All kinds of kidneys are good broiled; they must be skinned, 
split and all pipe removed. When done, pepper and salt each side. 
Save the gravy when it rises, put catsup in the dish, and when taken 



BROILING. 85 

up rub in a piece of fresh butter. Mustard is required with all kinds 
of steaks. The rule given by an epicure to his cook in general ap- 
plies particularly to steaks : "No matter how much or how little they 
are done, provided that all the blood is out and all the gravy 
on." 

BROILED Ox TAIL. Two tails, 11-2 pint of stock; salt and cay- 
enne to taste ; bread crumbs, i egg. Joint and cut up the tails into 
convenient sized pieces and put them into a stew pan with the s-tock, 
' cayenne and salt, and if liked, very little savory, and bunch of sweet 
herbs. Let them stew gently for 2 1-2 hours, then take them out, 
drain them and let them cool. Beat an egg upon a plate, dip in 
each piece of tail and afterwards throw them into a dish of bread 
crumbs ; broil them over a clear fire until of a brownish color on both 
sides and serve with a good gravy or any other sauce that may be 
preferred ; about 2 1-2 hours to cook ; seasonable at any time. 

N. B. These may be more easily prepared by putting the tails in 
a brisk oven after they have been dipped in egg and bread crumbs, 
and when brown they are done. They must be boiled the same time 
as for broiling. 

BEEF STEAK AND OYSTER SAUCE. Three dozen oysters, 2 pounds 
of rump steak; season, to taste with pepper and salt. Make the oys- 
ter sauce by given receipt, and when hot it is ready ; put it by the side 
of the fire, but do not let it keep boiling. Have the steak cut of 
equal thickness, broil them in the steak broiler over a very clear fire, 
turning them often that the gravy may not escape ; in about eight 
minutes they will be done ; put them on a very hot dish, smother 
with the oyster sauce and send them to the table in a tureen. 
Serve quickly ; cook 8 or 10 minutes, according to the thickness of 
the steak. 

To BROIL STEAK (Mrs. H.'s receipt. The meat should be hung 
several days before using it, if the weather is cool. Having hung 
long enough, cut the steaks 1-2 inch thick, 3 inches wide and 5 
inches long. Thus divided, it is a good size for managing on the 
gridiron, and as much as a person would care to have on their plate 
at once. Should any part be thicker than the rest, roll it with a roll- 
ing pin or very gently beat it out to the same thickness. The prac- 
tice of beating steak is very injudicious ; "it breaks the cells which 
contain the juices." Thus escaping, the meat becomes dry and 
tasteless better always to give the meat time to become tender and 
ripe for the gridiron. Sweep the hearth clean, give the dust a few 
minutes to settle, prepare a bed of brisk, solid coals, having the grid- 
iron looking as bright as a mirror, rub the bars well with brown pa- 
per or grease them slightly with suet or lard, not enough to drip, for 
this falling on the coals would produce smoke. Place the gridiron 



86 ROASTING. 

on the coals, and as soon as hot (not enough to scorch), lay on the 
steak and turn frequently with meat tongs or a knife. A fork, if in- 
serted in the steak, will injure its condition by -making "taps to let 
out the juice." I am conscious of repeating this caution often; I 
have done so because of the carelessness of the cooks in this mat- 
ter. To have the most simple duties performed satisfactorily re- 
quires line upon line and precept upon precept. The dish upon 
which the steak is to be placed must be hot; put in the dish a large 
slice of good sweet butter and add 2 tablespoonfuls of tomato or 
mushroom catsup, stir together ; as the butter warms, lay in the 
slices and turn over each slice, so that all may be covered alike with 
the gravy. This should be done very hastily and the steak sent im- 
mediately to the table. A small space of time should be allowed 
between the broil and the eating, to have it in perfection. With a 
well prepared sauce and proper accompaniments there is not a more 
elegant breakfast dish, and when the meat is juicy and tender, and 
the broiling performed with skill and dispatch, there is not a more 
delicate way of preparing this popular dish. The steak is underdone 
if, upon cutting, the red gravy flows; a few more moments should 
be allowed for dressing, as the rare appearance of the meat of any 
kind is disgusting to persons of good taste". 

ROASTING. 

ROASTING FIRE. A light, steady fire, and should never be allowed 
to get low. 

ROASTING. The usual rule for time allowed is a quarter of an 
hour to a pound and a few minutes over the joint, but this is not 
a positive rule, as much depends on the shape of the joint as 
well as the size, and in the strength of the fire and the nearness 
of the meat to it. 

Meat should be carefully wiped before washing. It is best not 
to salt meat before roasting, as it draws out the juices; it should 
therefore, if possible, be avoided. Pork is less injured than any other 
meat by it. The vegetables usually eaten with mutton roast are 
potatoes stewed or boiled, mashed, or browned under the meat; 
mashed turnips, French beans, cabbages, sea kale, turnip greens, 
cauliflower, spinach and onion sauce. 

BEEF. The roasting parts are the ribs, sirloin and rump. The 
rump must be slowly done at first ; that is, great thickness of solid 
meat may not be heated through before it begins to brown. 

BEEF HEART. Must be soaked in cold water till perfectly clear 
of the coagulated blood, then wiped thoroughly dry, stuffed as a hare 
and roasted or baked. Of the two, baking, if properly done, is 



ROASTING. 87 

preferable. It will require a great deal of basting, and will take 2 
hours or more, if large, for cooking. Eaten very hot. 

VEAL. Requires a quick fire and should be more thoroughly 
done than other mutton or beef; indeed all young meats require this, 
as they are both unpleasant and unwholesome if at all rare. Veal 
requires frequent basting ; also rather more flour to brown it than 
mutton or beef. When first put down a greased paper should be 
fixed on the rind of the neck or loin. The kidney, which is much 
esteemed, should be roasted in the loin ; or if it be desired, to 
have it browned, let it lie in the dripping pan. All roast veal 
should be served with a little good gravy and plenty of melted 
butter and garnished with slices of lemon. The vegetables that 
should accompany veal are potatoes either plain boiled, mashed or 
browned, and greens of every kind, but cauliflower, asparagus, sea 
kale and green peas are especially esteemed with roast veal. 

Lamb requires a brisk fire ; it should be quickly and thoroughly 
done. 

ROAST RIBS OF BEEF STUFFED, Make a stuffing as for fillet 
of veal, bone the beef, put the stuffing into the middle of it, roll it 
up and bind it very tight ; let it roast gently for about 2 hours and a 
half, 'or if very thick, 3 hours will do it sufficiently. Serve it up with 
a brown sauce of either celery, onions or oysters. 

To ROAST A ROUND OF BEEF (fresh.) Salt it, and then paste the 
outside (often rubbing it in) with hog's lard. This will cause it to 
brown nicely as well as to keep the juice in. Steak may be larded 
in the same way. 

A SUBSTITUTE for meat (Hebrew.) Stir thoroughly i spoonful of 
flour into 2 eggs. Fry with beef drippings (suet) or butter. 

ROAST FILLET OF BEEF. Turn and lard a fillet of beef with small 
shreds of fat bacon and soak it in 2 gills of cider vinegar, some oil, 
salt, pepper, sliced onions and some sprigs of parsley. The meat is 
generally allowed to soak for 24 hours. Clear the fillet of onions 
and parsley, put it on the spit, wrap it in buttered paper and put 
it to roast before an even fire or in a stove ; 5 minutes before 
serving take off the paper and glaze the fillet with meat glaze ; 
take it off the spit and put it on a dish; pour some meat gravy 
under it and serve with piquant sauce in a bowl. Fillet^of beef 
is sometimes roasted without being soaked in spiced liquors ; in that 
case serve it with the gravy only, without the sauce. 



88 STEWING. 



STEWING. 

A GOOD AND CHEAP DINNER. Get what butchers call a soup- 
bone from a nice, tender b,eef and salt it over night. Put it on in 
time, so that it will be cooked tender about 1-2 an hour before din- 
ner. Put in potatoes enough for your family, and make it boil brisk- 
ly for 15 minutes. If the potatoes are large, put it on sooner. About 
fifteen or twenty minutes before dinner, lift meat and potatoes into a 
pan with a little of the top of the broth, and if you have sweet po- 
tatoes, have them boiled sufficiently, so that a fork will enter, and 
put them, too, in the pan. Now, after the pan of meat has been 
placed in the oven, have a batter made ready, as stiff as it can 
be stirred. This batter should be made with an egir, a cup of sour 
milk, a small teaspoonful of soda, a pinch of salt and flour to thicken 
it. Into the soup (there should be plenty of it), seasoned to the 
taste and boiling, drop the batter, a small teaspoonful at a time, 
dipping the spoon into the soup between spoonfuls. Keep the pot 
boiling briskly, and stir gently, so that the separate spoonfuls of bat- 
ter will not run together. As soon as done they should be lifted at 
once, or they will get heavy. Such dumplings and soup, with good 
bread and butter, and a cup of nice coffee, or anything else that can 
be afforded for dessert, makes a good and cheap dinner at any time. 

STEWED Ox HEART. Cut it up lengthwise into long, thin pieces, 
put them into a stew-pot of cold water or pot-liquor, with salt ; let 
it simmer, and carefully skim away the blood, which may be thrown 
up in large quantities ; when nearly tender, take out the pieces of 
meat and carve them neatly into mouthfuls, dredge a little flour over 
them, season with a little pepper and allspice, and return to the 
strained liquor with six or eight small onions chopped fine, a stick 
or two of celery cut up, a dozen parboiled potatoes and a little cat- 
sup or walnut pickle, and let all simmer together until the meat and 
vegetables are perfectly tender and the gravy rich and well mingled. 

STEWED Ox TAIL AND POTATOES. The tails should be divided 
at the joints. Put the tails and potatoes in as much water or broth 
as will cover them ; simmer the tails one hour and the potatoes until 
the skin will easily peel off; let the liquor cool to remove the fat. 
The tails may be either whole or cut in slices, and the gravy, which 
thicken and season with butter rolled in brown flour (which is done 
by spreading a thin surface of it on a plate or tin and drying it 
in the oven), cayenne pepper, shallot or onions, catsup or walnut 
pickle and a little mustard, and stew very slowly until perfectly 
tender. Serve with toasted slices of bread and pickled onions, 
cucumbers or walnuts. 



STEWING. 89 

Ox CHEEK STEW. Stew it down in a large quantity of water 4 
gallons will not be too much. Having done this, remove the 
cheek and leave liquor to cool, when a large quantity of excel- 
lent fat will be found to have risen on the top ; remove this, and do 
cheek and liquor again with any herbs desired, or thickening. 
Let it boil until the meat is perfectly tender and the liquor has 
boiled away about one-half. This is one of the cheapest and 
most nourishing dishes that can be prepared for a poor family. 

STEWED Ox CHEEK. One cheek, salt and water, 4 or 5 onions, 
butter and flour, 6 cloves, 3 turnips, 2 carrots, i bay leaf, i head 
of celery, i bunch of savory herbs, cayenne, black pepper and 
salt to taste, i oz. of butter, 2 tablespoonfuls flour, 2 tablespoon- 
fuls mushroom catsup, 2 tablespoonfuls port wine, 2 tablespoon- 
fuls tomato sauce. Have the cheek boned, and prepare it the 
day before it is to be eaten, by cleaning and putting it to soak 
all night in salt and water. The next day wipe it dry and clean 
and put it into a stew-pan. Just cover it with water, skim well 
when it boils and let it gently simmer until the meat is quite 
tender. Slice and fry 3 onions in a little butter and flour, and 
put them into the gravy ; add 2 whole onions, each stuck with 
3 cloves, 3 turnips quartered, 2 carrots stuck, a bay leaf, i head of 
celery, a bunch of herbs and seasoning to taste, of cayenne, black 
pepper and salt. Let these stew until perfectly tender ; then take 
out the cheek, divide into pieces fit to help at table, thin and strain 
the gravy, and thicken i 1-2 pint of it with butter and flour in the 
above proportions ; add the vinegar, catsup and port wine ; put in the 
pieces of cheek ; let the whole boil up, and serve quite hot ; send it 
to table in a ragout dish. If the color of the gravy should not be 
very good, add a tablespoonful of the browning. Cook 4. hours. 
Seasonable at any time 

STEWED TRIPE. Select 2 Ibs. of double tripe, cut it in strips 
of 1-4 Ib each, put in a clean stew pan, add a pint each of wa- 
ter and milk, 2 teaspoonfuls of salt, i spoonful of pepper, eight 
middling sized onions carefully peeled, which put in, set to boil 
rather fast, then simmer till done, which will be 1-4 hour or more. 
Turn out into a deep dish or tureen and serve. 

STEWED BEEF'S TONGUE. Salt a tongue with saltpetre and com- 
mon salt for a week, turning it every day. Boil it till tender enough 
to peel; when done stew it in a moderately strong gravy ; season 
with sage, mushroom catsup, cayenne, pounded cloves, and salt if 
necessary. Serve with mushrooms. The roots must be taken off 
the tongue before salting, but some fat left. 

CALF'S HEAD STEW. Take the pieces of meat from the soup pot, 
chip them fine, put them into a sauce pan with some of the gravy, 



9O DIFFERENT WAYS TO COOK MEAT. 

and stew. Pick the brains and mix them with grated bread, pepper 
and salt, and work them into small cakes with the yolk of an egg, fry 
them and put them in the soup after it is placed in the tureen ; put 
paste that is^baked separately, around the stew, then put them in a 
dish and add catsup and a few hard boiled eggs. 

STEWED SHIN OF BEEF. A shin of beef, i head of celery, i onion, 
a faggot of savory herbs, 1-2 teaspoonful allspice, 1-2 teaspooful of 
whole black pepper", 4 carrots, 1 2 button onions, 2 turnips, thicken- 
ing of butter and flour, 3 tablespoonfuls of mushroon catsup, 2 of 
port wine, and pepper and salt to taste. Have the bone sawed into 
4 or 5 pieces, cover with hot water, bring it to a boil, and remove any 
scum that may rise to the surface. Put in the celery, onion, herbs, 
spice, seasoning, and simmer very gently until the meat is tender. 
Put in the vegetables, cut them into any shape fancy may dictate 
and boil them with the onions till tender ; lift out the beef, put it on 
a dish, which keep hot, and thicken with butter and flour in as much 
of the liquor as will be wanted for the gravy. Keep stirring until it 
boils, then strain and thin it. Put the gravy back in the stewpan, 
add the seasoning, put in the wine and catsup, give it one boil, and 
pour over the beef. Garnish with the boiled carrots, turnips and 
onions. The meat may be stewed 4 hours. Seasonable at any 
time. 

To STEW A BRISKET OF BEEF. Put the part which has the hard 
fat into a stew-pot with a small quantity of water ; let it boil up and 
skim it thoroughly ; then add carrots, turnips, onions, celery and a 
few pepper corns. Stew until extremely tender ; then take out the 
flat bones and remove all the fat from the soup. Either serve that 
and the meat in a tureen, or the soup alone and the meat on a dish 
garnished with some vegetables. The following sauce is much ad- 
mired served with beef: Take 1-2 pint of soup and mix it with a 
teaspoonful of made mustard, a little flour, a bit of butter and salt ; 
boil all together a few minutes and then pour it around the meat. 
Chop capers, walnuts, red cabbage, pickled cucumbers, cloves or 
parsley small, and put in separate heaps over it. 

DIFFERENT WAYS TO COOK MEAT. 

STEAK A LA MODE (Mrs. H.'s receipt.) After cutting the steak 
in thin slices, pound it lightly. The beef should hang till tender. 
Lay the slices in an earthen baking dish and between each layer put 
a seasoning of a mixture of bread crumbs, 1-2 teaspoonful each of 
mace, cloves, allspice, ginger, red pepper ; salt to taste, a cupful of 
tomato catsup, i tablespoonful of butter. Bake 1-2 hour in a mod- 
erate oven. Veal, pork, mutton and venison are good prepared in.

this way. When spices are not relished with meat, always omit them 
and use any seasoning preferred. 

VEAL A LA MODE (baked.) This should be prepared 2 days be- 
fore cooking. Remove the skin and rancid parts of 1-2 Ib. of bacon, 
cut it in thin strips 2 inches long and 1-4 thick, make incisions all 
over the meat near each other with a sharp knife, then take 1-4 Ib. 
of kidney suet and i tablespoonful each of thyme, parsley chopped 
fine, 4 tablespoonfuls of onion shreded fine, a teaspoonful of mace, 
cloves, allspice, i nutmeg pounded and sifted ; put in the parsley 
and onions and mix the whole. Mix an even tablespoonful of salt 
and season high with black and red pepper mixed. Into each incis- 
ion put a little seasoning, then roll each slice of bacon into it and 
press them down into the slits and cover the top of the meat with 
the seasoning. Lay it in a deep earthen pan large enough to hold 
it without cramping ; cover it close and keep it 2 days after it is pre- 
pared in this way. When ready for the oven pour a cupful of water 
in the dish and bake 4 hours if the piece weighs 10 Ibs. Baste it 
well with sweet lard. This is good when cold, and is best in cold 
weather. 

A LA MODE BEKF (Miss Page.) Take a piece of beef 4 or 5 
inches thick, and with a small knife make small incisions entirely 
through it at small distances apart, then take strips of fat salt pork, 
roll them in pepper and cloves, lay on a pan, cover closely and put 
over a steamer and steam for 3 hours. When done thicken the gravy 
in -the pan with a little flour. This is excellent when eaten with cold 
meat. 

MARINADE. Take i Ib. of raw ham, 1-2 lean, 1-2 fat, cut it in 
pieces, put these in a stew pan with 4 bay leaves, i sprig of thyme, 
6 ounces of onion, 6 ounces of carrots, 2 ounces of parsley, two un- 
picked cloves of garlic, 6 shallots, 6 ounces butter. Fry the whole 
together, then moisten with 2 quarts of water and 2 quarts of pure 
vinegar ; boil for 2 minutes, add 3 ounces of salt and one ounce of 
pepper. 

MARINADED LAMB'S FEET WITH TOMATO SAUCE. Cook the feet 
with some fat bacon fried from the rind and gristle of some veal, 
chop and pound the veal and bacon together ; while pounding add i 
gill of tomato sauce for each Ib. of forcemeat of bacon and veal ; 
drain the feet and bones and cut them in two lengthwise ; spread out 
some pig's caul on a cloth, place on it a layer of the forcemeat the 
same length as that of the lamb's foot, put 2 slices of trouffle on the 
force meat and 1-2 a lamb's foot on these; then 2 more slices of 
truffle and cover the whole with a layer of forcemeat ; roll it in the 
caul to an oval shape ; and when all the feet are stuffed in this way 
dip them in butter, bread crumbs and broil them over a slow fire for 
15 minutes with some nice sauce in a boat. 



92 DIFFERENT WAYS TO COOK MEAT. 

HOT BEEF A LA MODE. Take 41-2 Ibs. of flank steak and 10 
ounces of fat bacon, (cut off the rind and put it aside to blanch,) 
cut the bacon into strips 1-2 inch thick and sprinkle them with 
pepper. Lard the beef in the grain of the meat and tie it up 
with strings ; put into a stew pan with i pint of French white wine 
or good vinegar, i gill of brandy, i 1-2 pint of broth, 2 calves' 
feet which have been blanched and boned ; also the blanched rind 
of bacon ; put on the fire and add i ounce of salt ; boil and skim, 
then add 3 carrots, i onion, 2 small pinches of pepper, 3 cloves 
and parsley, thyme and a little sage. Put to simmer in a closed 
stew pan for 4 hours and a half on the stove corner ; try the beef, 
and when done take it out together with the calf's feet and carrots ; 
keep hot till serving ; strain the gravy through a pointed gravy 
strainer, take off all the fat and reduce it 1-4; untie the beef, put it 
on a dish and garnish it around with calf's feet, each cut into eight 
pieces, with the carrots cut to the shape of corks and 10 glazed on- 
ions. Pour the gravy over all, and should there be too much reserve 
it for the next day. Taste for seasoning a la mode beef should be 
full flavored ; a clove of garlic is sometimes added. This is not es- 
sential, for the taste of the mistress must be consulted. 

COLD BEKF A LA MODE. Cold beef a la mode should be prepared 
as directed for hot beef a la mode. Put in a basin together with the 
calf's feet vegetables and the gravy, which will be set to a jelly ; 
when ready to serve turn out of the basin on to a dish ; the beef a la 
mode will then present its proper appearance. 

N. B. The main points in the preparation of so popular a dish as 
beef a la mode are as follows : After the selection of the meat, the 
great secret of success is to cook it very slowly. When cooked hurriedly 
it invariably produces white, watery and insipid gravy. Slow cook- 
ing produces red, rather thick gravy of a gelatinous consistency, full 
of nourishing flavor of the vegetables stewed in the gravy, which 
is one of the characteristics of a la mode beef. The carrots and 
spices should be cooked with the meat, by which they add a savory 
flavor which is so much prized by connoiseusrs. I would recommend 
that the pieces of meat should be chosen rather too large than 
small. 

RIB OF BEEF BONES (A Pretty dish). Rib of beef bones, one 
onion chopped fine, a few slices of carrot and turnips, and 1-2 pint 
of gravy. The bones for this dish should have left on them a slight 
covering of meat. Saw them into pieces 3 inches long; season 
them with pepper and salt, and put them into a stewpan with the re- 
maining ingredients. Stew gently until the vegetables are tender, 
and serve on a flat dish within walls of mashed potatoes. Cook 3-4 
of an hour. Seasonable at any time.

BOILLI BEEF. Take 5 or 6 Ibs. of good, tender beef from the 
rump, brisket or long ribs ; the rump or round is the best. Put it in 
a pot of cold water, enough to cover the beef well ; let it boil until 
the scum rises, and skim it nicely ; add 2 carrots, 2 turnips cut in 
shape, and stick one onion full of cloves. Let this simmer 3 hours, 
and then add i tablespoonful of red wine, a teaspoonful each of 
parsley and thyme chopped fine, a teaspoonful of mixed mustard and 

1 tablespoonful of catsup. Simmer i hour and take the beef out 
and stir. 

SMOTHERED BEEFSTEAK. After pounding your steak well on both 
sides, broil it on a clean and well-greased griddle over a clear fire. 
Turn it frequently. 

To ROAST A BREAST OF VEAL. Before roasted, if large, the 
two ends may be taken off and fried to a stew, or the whole may be 
roasted. Butter should be poured over it. If any be left, cut the 
pieces into handsome sizes, put them into a stew-pan and pour some 
broth over them, or, if you have no broth, a little water will do ; add 
some parsley, thyme, a blade of mace and some pepper. Stew until 
tender. Thicken with butter and flour and add a little tomato, wal- 
nut or cucumber catsup ; or the whole breast may be stewed. After 
cutting off the two ends, serve the sweetbread whole upon it, which 
may be either stewed or parboiled, and then cover with crumbs, 
herbs, pepper and salt and browned in a Dutch oven. If you have 
mushrooms, truffles and muscles, stew them with it, and serve. A 
roasted breast of veal smothered with onion sauce is an excellent 
dish if not old or too fat. 

VEAL STUFFING. Take 1-2 Ib. finely chopped suet with 1-2 Ib. 
of bread crumbs, 4 oz. chopped parsley, a bay leaf, a tablespoonful 
of equal quantities of powdered thyme and marjoram and 2 bay 
leaves, the rind of a lemon^. grated and the juice of 1-2 a one. 
Season with pepper, salt and 1-4 of a nutmeg. Mix the whole with 
3 eggs. By adding some more chopped parsley this will do to stuff 
a turkey or bake a fish with. 

Note. A nice garnish may be made of beet root, cut gherkins, 
cucumbers and olives. 

To FRY VEAL (Mrs. Baringer). Cut the meat in 'thin slices, 
rub with pepper and salt, dip in flour and drop it into a pan of hot 
lard. When of a fine brown, take it up and make a gravy with 
cream or milk poured into the skillet and pour over the veal. Gar- 
nish with parsley. 

BAKED VEAL. One-half Ib. cold roast veal, a few slices of bacon, 

2 cups of bread crumbs, i cup of good veal gravy, 1-2 teaspoonful 
minced lemon peel, i blade of pounded mace, cayenne pepper and 
salt to taste, and 4 eggs. Mince finely the veal and bacon ; add 



94 DIFFERENT WAYS TO COOK MEAT. 

the bread crumbs, gravy and seasoning, stir these ingredients well 
together. Beat up the eggs thoroughly ; add these, mix the whole 
well together, put into a dish and bake from 3-4 to i hour. Ifliked, 
a little good gravy may be served in a tureen as an accompaniment. 
For 3 or 4 persons. 

To BAKE A FILLET OF VEAL. Let it hang until tender, wiping it 
every day with a dry cloth. Should not lay it upon wood, as that 
keeps the meat damp. When prepared, for baking, with a sharp 
knife separate the fillet or thigh from the loin and shank and remove 
the bone, fill the space with a rich stuffing of bread crumbs, chopped 
onion, parsley and a tablespoonful of butter, pepper and salt to taste. 
Beat in 2 eggs and fry the mixture, stirring constantly 10 minutes ; 
wrap the flap around. It should be as before the bone was removed, 
after being stuffed and wrapped, tie a tape or cord around it and 
insert a skewer; put it in the oven with something under to elevate 
it an inch at least, and pour in 2 cupfuls of warm water. Bake 
slowly and baste often. If the gravy is not rich enough rub an even 
teaspoonful of flour into a tablespoonful of butter and add to the 
gravy. Tomato catsup, with the gravy, is an improvement. To 2 
cupfuls of gravy add 1-2 cupful of catsup, or stew a few tomatoes 
and a little spice with the gravy. A fillet of beef resembles the 
round of a beef that is covered in the same way. Cut off the top 
outside piece, then cut round, thin slices and send some of the stuff- 
ing upon each plate. Serve with pickles, catsup or French mus- 
tard. 

BEEF'S LIVER (LIVERS TO COOK) Cut the liver in scores 
and salt it with 2 Ibs. of salt for a fortnight, then let it drain for 3 
days, then rub in 2 ounces of several kinds of spice, according to 
your judgment, and all sorts of sweet herbs chopped very fine ; also 
a good seasoning of onions and shallots ; then hang in a dry, cool 
place for a- time, then put in a bag for use. A small piece is suffi- 
cient to make gravy for ducks, hares, &c. It will keep many months 
and be useful in this manner. 

To FRY LIVER, SMELTS, SWEET BREADS, &c. Parboil them till 
2-3 done, take the liver out and cut it in thin slices. It should not 
be boiled in much water ; then put it back into the frying pan with 
the sweet breads, &c., chopped onions, pepper, cayenne and salt, and 
fry slowly till done, then take it up and make a nice gravy of milk 
thickened with a small portion of flour, then serve ; or fry the liver as 
beefsteak and eat it rather rare after salting and peppering it. 

PIG'S HEARTLET (Mrs. H.'s receipt.) Clean the liver and sweet 
breads and put to them the fat and lean bits of pork, with which 
mix pepper, salt, sage and onion shred fine; put all into a caul, tie 
up and roast on a hanging Jack, or put into a dish and bake ; or 



DIFFERENT WAYS TO COOK MEAT. 95 

slice the liver and sweet breads and fry them with pieces of bacon ; 
garnish with fried parsley. 

CALF'S OR LAMB'S LIVER. Should be cut in long, thin slices 
soaked in water, wiped thoroughly dry and floured on each side ; fry 
of a fine nut brown ; when nearly done sprinkle a little pepper and 
salt, some shallots or young onion finely sliced, a little gravy thick- 
ened with flour and butter, to which may be added a squeeze of 
lemon. Serve with stewed or pickled cucumbers and fried parsley. 

To FRY LIVER. Cut your liver in nice pieces, put in cold water, 
and let it boil until it looks nearly done, take it out and drip into hot 
lard. Season it with pepper and salt as you take it up. 

To BAKE A FRESH BEEF TONGUE. Take just enough water to 
cover it and parboil for 2 hours ; take it up and dip it in the yolk of 
an egg, then sift over it dusted breadcrumbs, lay it in a baking pan 
and pour over it a cupful of the broth in which it was boiled ; bake, 
basting well with butter. 

. To BOIL A SALT TONGUE. Soak it over night in plenty of water, 
put it to boil in more water than to cover it ; while boiling, if it 
is too salt change the water ; it requires long boiling. Ascertain 
when it is done by running a small skewer in the skin, carefully 
remove the rough part of the root and garnish the dish with pars- 
ley. Slice round. This may be eaten hot at dinner or cold for supper. 

Smoked tongue is prepared in the same way. Be sure to boil 
till tender. Fresh tongue must be first boiled, then dipped in 
beaten egg, rolled in bread crumbs and baked in a pan. Pour 
in a cupful of the broth it was boiled in, baste it well with butter; 
1-2 hour will be sufficient time for baking. Season the gravy with 
any good catsup. 

To BOIL A CALF'S HEAD. After being well cleaned it is best to 
keep the skin on ; it will require an hour longer in cooking when the 
skin is retained. The head should be fat. Cut apart the upper 
and lower jaws, remove the eyes ; they are never used. Take out 
the bone containing the teeth ; also the nose. and ears; cut out the 
tongue, remove the brains, put the head and tongue to boil in enough 
warm water to cover them, tie the brains in a cloth, boil all until ten- 
der ; vegetables may be boiled with the head ; if liked, onions, car- 
rots, parsley and thyme. Serve the head upon i dish ; upon an- 
other place the tongue and brains, or make sauce of the brains ; 
take a pint of the broth, put it in a stew pan, add a tablespoonful of 
parsley chopped fine ; salt and cayenne pepper to taste. Let these 
stew 1-4 hour; add a large tablespoonful of butter into which has 
been rubbed a dessert spoonful of flour ; stew this 5 minutes and 
serve with the head ; use the remainder of the broth for soup. It is 



96 DIFFERENT WAYS TO COOK MEAT. 

the basis or stock of mock turtle soup. Season the brains with sage 
if the flavor is liked. Garnish with lemon. 

COLLARED CALF'S HEAD. A calf's head, 4 tablespoonfuls minced 
parsley, 4 blades of pounded mace, 1-2 teaspoonful of grated nut- 
meg ; white pepper to taste, a few thick slices of ham ; the yolks of 6 
eggs boiled hard. Scald the head for a few minutes, take it out of 
the water, and with a blunt knife scrape off all the hair, clean it nicely, 
divide the head and remove the brains ; boil till tender e.nough to 
take out the bones, which will be about 2 hours. When the head is 
boned flatten it on the table, sprinkle over it a layer of parsley, then 
a layer of ham, and then the yolks of the eggs cut into thin rings and 
put a seasoning of mace, nutmeg and white pepper between each 
layer ; roll the head in a cloth and tie it up as tightly as possible. 
Boil it for 4 hours, and when it is taken out of the pot place a heavy, 
weight on the top, the same as for other collars. Let it remain till 
cold, then remove the cloth and binding, and it will be ready to serve. 
Altogether 6 hours. 

SALT BEEF. If it be required to get a piece of salt beef for im- 
mediate use, the moment it comes into the house rub in 1-2 the usual 
quantity of salt and let it lie for awhile till time to put it into the 
pot when boiling. When it has boiled an hour take it out, rub in 
some salt, flour the cloth again and return it in the same manner. 
Allow it the usual time for boiling. By this method it will be found 
salt enough. Mustard is always eaten with boiled beef. Those who 
do not choose anything so plain for their own eating may do a good 
action by boiling a little for some poor family in the neighborhood. 
Meat that has necessarily lain in salt may be freshened up by soaking 
it in one or more waters. In boiling be very careful to remove the 
scum till no more rises, and even then it may be necessary to throw 
in a little cold water to refine the liquor. The pot shoufd be kept 
covered and the meat turned once or twice while boiling. 

TRIPE LYONNAISE FASHION. When any cold tripe remains, cut 
in thin slices about the thickness of an inch square, mince 2 onions, 
put some butter in a frying pan, add in the onions, fry till they are 
partly done, add the tripe, let them fry 10 minutes, tossing them, 
season with salt and pepper, 3 spoonfuls of vinegar to each i Ib. 
and serve. Well dry the tripe on a dish before frying. It will take 
3 ounces of butter to the Ib. 

BOILED TRIPE. After the animal is killed, as soon as possible 
have the stomach emptied, and well washed in cold water; sprinkle 
lime or ashes over the inside, fold it carefully and lay it in a vessel ; 
cover it with warm water for 6 hours and then scrape off the 
dark, part. When this is removed wash it in several waters and place 
it in another vessel filled with salt and water. The first jar should 



DIFFERENT WAYS TO COOK MEAT. 97 

be scalded and cleaned well. Boil the tripe, putting it in cold 
water until a straw will easily pierce it and the edges look trans- 
parent ; skim closely, and when the tripe is tender take it up and 
cut it in uniform sizes convenient for serving ; pour over milk or 
milk and water and keep it closely covered. Should the milk 
turn sour a little it will not injure the tripe, as it is usual to add vine- 
gar in cooking it. It should not be kept long ; either fry, stew or 
hash it ; when made into a hash use onions freely and cover with 
pickle. 

FRICASSEE ROUND OF BEEF. From 5 to 10 Ibs. of rib of beef, 
sufficient brine to cover the meat. Choose a fine rib, have the bones 
removed, rub some salt over the inside and skewer the meat up into 
a nice round form and bind it with tape. Put it in sufficient brine 
to cover it, and then let it remain for six days, turning the meat 
every day. When required to be dressed drain from the pickle 
and put the meat into very hot water ; let it boil rapidly for a 
few minutes, then draw the pot to the side of the fire and let it 
simmer very gently till done. Remove the skewer and replace 
by a plated or silver one. Carrots and turnips should be serv- 
ed with this dish. There may be boiled with the meat a small 
round of 8 Ibs. about 2 hours after the water boils; i of 12 Ibs. 
3 hours. Seasonable at any time. Should the joints be small, 4 
or 5 days will be sufficient time to salt it. - 

To BOIL CORN BEEF. Let the beef soak in a full supply of 
water to cover it. In the morning after breakfast hour wash the 
meat well, put it in a cooking vessel and cover it over with cold 
water ; boil slowly and skim frequently. If it is to be sewed cold 
let it remain in the pot till it becomes so. To prepare it for a 
Supper dish or luncheon take out all the bones ; when thoroughly 
done prick the meat and put it into a deep dish, putting alter- 
nately fat and lean ; remove all the fat by skimming. Reduce 
this to 1-2 by boiling, then pour over the meat enough to fill up the 
cracks left in filling up the meat, then lay over this a flat cover that 
will just fit it, and upon this place a heavy weight. This dish is best 
prepared in cold weather and put ice on the dish in which it is. 
Serve it upon a round dish and garnished with sprigs of parsley or 
tops of celery, or any good pickle. French mustard is good eaten 
with it. 

BAKED BEEF. Two Ibs. of cold roast beef, 2 small onions, i large 
carrot or 2 small ones, i turnip, parsley, sage, thyme, pepper and 
salt to taste; 12 tablespoonfuls of gravy, 3'spoonfuls of vinegar or 
ale, and mashed potatoes. Cut the beef in slices, allowing a 
small amount of fat to each slice; place a layer of this in the battom 
of the pie dish with a portion of the onions, carrots and turnips, 



98 DIFFERENT WAYS TO COOK MEAT. 

which must be sliced ; mince the herbs, strew them over the meat 
and season with pepper and salt. Then put in another layer of meat, 
vegetables and seasoning ; proceed in this manner until all the in- 
gredients are used. Pour in the gravy, vinegar or ale (water may be 
substituted for the gravy, but it is not so nice.) Cover with a crust 
of mashed potatoes and bake for 1-2 hour, or rather longer. It is 
sufficient for 5 or 6 persons. 

N. B. It is better to parboil the carrots and turnips before adding 
them to the meat, and to use some of the liquor in which they are 
boiled as a substitute for gravy ; that is to say, when there is no gravy 
at hand. Be particular to cut the onions in very thin slices. 

BAKED SPICED BEEF. (Mrs. B.'s Receipt.) Make a brine of 1-2 
Ib. of salt, the same of sugar, 1-2 ounce of saltpetre, a table- 
spoonful of allspice, whole grains, measure and bruise them, half 
as many cloves, a tablespoonful of black pepper ground coarse, 
1-2 teaspoonful of cayenne pepper pulverized. Boil these in three 
coffee cups of water. Take a piece of the round weighing 8 Ibs., 
pour this spiced water over it and turn it once or twice a day 
for 10 days, then salt it sufficiently and put it to bake in an 
earthen dish ; pour the brine over it, cover with a dough made 
of coarse flour and water, lay pieces of suet over the meat thick 
before putting on the sheet of dough. Bake slowly and let the 
meat become cold in the pan. To be eaten cold with French 
mustard. This keeps well; fresh beef tongues are good prepared in 
this way. 

MRS. RANDOLPH'S RECEIPT FOR HUNTER'S BAKED BEEF. Select 
a fat round weighing 25 Ibs. take 3 ounces of saltpetre, i ounce 
of cloves, 1-2 ounce of allspice, i large nutmeg, i quart of salt, i 
cup of syrup ; rub it well on both sides with the mixture ; first take 
out the bone. 

POTTED COOKED BEEF. The remains of cold roast or boiled beet, 
1-4 Ib. of butter, cayenne to taste ; 2 blades of pounded mace; the 
outside slices of beef may, with a little trouble, be converted into a 
very nice addition to the breakfast table. Cut off the meat into small 
pieces and pound it well with a little butter in a mortar ; add a seas- 
oning of mace and cayenne and be very particular that the mace is 
reduced to the finest powder. When all the ingredients are thor- 
oughly mixed put it into glass or earthen pots and pour on the top a 
coating of clarified butter. Seasonable at any time. When an or- 
ganic substance like the flesh of animals is heated to the boiling 
point it loses the property of passing into a state of fermentation 
and decay. After being kept for 2 or 3 days, fresh animal milk, as 
is well known, coagulates into a gelatinous mass, and if it be heated 
up to* the boiling point it may be preserved for an indefinite pe-

riod as a perfectly sweet liquid. The knowledge of this effect of an 
elevated temperature has given rise to a most important branch of 
industry, namely, the preparation of prepared meats, vegetables, 
fruits, soups and milk for the navy, army and merchant service, and 
for domestic use, when they are prepared in such a manner that they 
retain their freshness for years. These prepared aliments are en- 
closed in canisters of tinned plate, the covers are soldered air tight, 
and the canisters exposed to the temperature of boiling water for 3 
or 4 hours. When a canister is opened after a lapse of years its 
contents are found to be unaltered in taste, color and smell. They 
then acquire a stability which may almost be deemed eternal. For 
this beautiful practical application of the discovery that boiling checks 
fermentation, we are indebted to the French philosopher, Gay Sus- 
sac. 

To POT BEEF OR MUTTON. Take 2 pounds of lean beef, rub it 
with saltpetre and let it lie i night, then salt it with common salt 
and cover it with water 4 days in a small pan. Dry it with a cloth 
and season it with black pepper ; lay it in as small a pan as will hold 
it, cover it with coarse paste and bake 5 hours in a cool oven. Put 
no liquor in : when cold pick out the strings and fat, beat the meat 
very fine, with 1-4 Ib. of fine fresh butter just warm but not oiled, and 
as much gravy as will make it into a paste. Put it into very small 
pots and cover with melted butter. 

MOULDED MINCED VEAL. 3-4 Ib. cold veal, a small slice of ba- 
con, 1-3 teaspoonful of minced lemon peel, 1-2 onion chopped fine, 
salt, pepper and pounded mace to taste, a slice of toast soaked in 
milk and i egg. Mince the meat very fine after removing from it 
all skin and outside pieces and chop the bacon ; mix these well to- 
gether, adding the lemon peel, onion, seasoning, mace and toast. 
When all the ingredients are thoroughly mixed, beat up an egg, with 
which bind the mixture. Butter a shape, put in the meat and bake 
for 3-4 of an hour ; turn it out of the mould carefully and pour round 
it good bacon gravy. A sheep's head dressed in the same manner 
is an economical and savory dish. Cook 3-4 of an hour. 

MINCED VEAL (More economical). The remains of cold roast 
fillet or loin of veal, rather more than i pint of water, i onion, 
1-2 teaspoonful of minced lemon peel, salt and white pepper to 
taste, i blade of pounded mace, 2 or 3 young carrots, a faggot 
of sweet herbs, thickening of butter and flour, i tablespoonful 
lemon juice, and 3 tablespoonfuls of cream or new milk. Take 
about i Ib. of veal, and should there be any bones, dredge them 
with flour and put them into a stew-pan with the brown outside 
and a few meat trimmings ; add rather more than i pint of water, 
the onions cut in slices, lemon peel, seasoning, mace, carrots 



IOO DIFFERENT WAYS TO COOK MEAT. 

and herbs ; simmer these for i hour, and strain the liquor. Rub 
a little flour into some butter, add this to the gravy, set it on 
the fire, and, when it boils, skim it well. Mince the meat finely 
by cutting and not chopping it ; put it in the gravy and let it 
get warmed through gradually; add the lemon juice and cream, 
and, when it is on the point of boiling, serve. Garnish the dish 
with sippets of toasted bread and slices of bacon rolled and toasted. 
Forcemeat balls may also be added. If more lemon juice is 
liked than is stated above, put a little very finely minced to the 
veal, after it is warmed in the gravy. One hour to make the 
gravy. 

FRICANDEAU OF BEEF. Three Ibs. of the inside fillet of the 
sirloin (a piece of the rump may be substituted for this), pepper 
and salt to taste, 3 cloves, 2 blades of mace, 6 whole allspice 
berries, i pint of stock or water, i glass of sherry, i bunch of 
savory herbs, 2 shallots and bacon. Cut some bacon into thin 
strips and sprinkle over them a seasoning of salt and pepper 
mixed with cloves, mace and allspice well pounded. Lard the beef 
with these, put it into a stew-pan with the stock or water, sherry, 
herbs, shallots, 2 cloves, and some pepper and salt. Stew the meat 
gently until tender, then take it out, cover it closely, skim off the fat 
from the gravy, and strain it. Set it on the fire and let it boil till it 
becomes glaze. Glaze the larded side with this and serve on sorrel 
sauce, which is made as follows : Wash and pick some sorrel, put it 
into a stewpan with only the water that hangs about it ; keep stirring 
to prevent it burning, and when done, lay it on a sieve to dry. Chip 
and stew it with a small piece of butter and 4 or 5 tablespoonfuls of 
good gravy for i hour, and rub it through a tammy. ' If too acrid, 
add a little sugar, and a little cabbage, lettuce boiled with the sorrel 
will be found to be an improvement. Two hours to gently stew the 
meat. Seasonable at any time. 

FRICANDEAU OF VEAL. A piece of the fat side of a leg of mut- 
on (about 3 Ibs.), lardones, 2 carrots, 2 large onions, a faggot of 
savory herbs, 2 blades of pounded mace, 6 whole allspice, 2 bay 
leaves, pepper to taste, a few slices of fat bacon and i pint of stock. 
The veal for a fricandeau should be of the best quality, or it will not 
be good. It may be known by the meat being white and not thready. 
Take off the skin, flatten the veal on the table, then at one stroke of 
the knife cut off as much as is required, for a fricandeau with an un- 
even surface never looks well. Trim it, with a sharp knife make 2 
or 3 slits in the middle, that it may taste more of the seasoning. 
Now lard it thickly with the fat bacon, as lean bacon gives a red 
color to the fricandeau. Slice the vegetables and put these with the 
spices and herbs in the middle of a stew-pan, with a few slices of 



DIFFERENT WAYS TO COOK MEAT. IOI 

bacon on the top. These should form a sort of mound in the center 
for the veal to rest upon. Lay the fricandeau over the bacon, sprinkle 
over it a little salt and pour in just sufficient stock to cover the ba- 
con, 'etc., without touching the veal. Let it gradually come to a boil, 
then put it over a slow and equal fire and let it simmer very gently 
for about 2 1-2 hours, or longer, should it be very large. Baste it 
frequently with the liquor, and a short time before serving put it into 
a brisk oven to make the bacon firm, which, otherwise would break 
when it was glazed. Dish the fricandeau and serve with a puree of 
whatever vegetable happens to be in season spinach, sorrel, aspar- 
agus, cucumbers, peas, etc. Cook 21-2 hours. If very large, 
allow more time. 

VKAL CUTLETS. Three Ibs. of the prime part of the leg of veal, 
egg and bread crumbs, 3 tablespoon fuls of minced savory herbs, 
salt and pepper to taste, and a small piece of butter. Have the 
veal cut in slices about 3-4 of an inch in thickness, and, if not cut 
perfectly even, level the meat with a cutlet bat or rollingpin. Shape- 
and trim the cutlets and brush them over with egg. Sprinkle with 
breadcrumbs, with which have been mixed some minced herbs and 
a seasoning of pepper and salt, and press down the crumbs. Fry 
them a delicate brown in fresh lard or butter, and be careful not to 
burn them. They should be very thoroughly done, but not dry. If 
the cutlets are thick, keep the pan covered for a few minutes at a 
good distance from the fire after they have acquired a good color. 
By this means the meat will be done through. Lay the cutlets in a 
dish, keep them hot and make a gravy in the pan as follows: Dredge 
in a little flour, add a piece of butter as large as a walnut, and then 
pour as much boiling water over it as is required. Season with 
pepper and salt, add a little lemon juice, give one boil and pour it 
over the cutlets. They should be garnished with slices of broiled 
bacon, and a few forcemeat balls will be found a very excellent 
addition to the dish. For cutlets of a moderate thickness about 
12 minutes; if very thick, allow more time. Veal cutlets maybe 
nicely flavored and fried a nice brown. 

VEAL when eaten should have the juice of an orange squeezed 
over it. C. C. B. 

VEAL LOAF. Three Ibs. of veal cutlets, 1-2 Ib. of fat pork, 
ail chopped fine, i cup of powdered crackers, i cup of cold wa- 
ter, salt, pepper, sage, etc., and i egg. Bake 2 1-2 hours. 

CALF'S HEAD, ONE-HALF BOILED AND THE OTHER BAKED. 
Cleause the head, parboil 1-2 and rub it over with a feather 
dipped in the beaten yolk of an egg. Strew over it a seasoning 
of pepper, salt, thyme, parsley chopped small, cayenne pepper, a 
spoonful of powdered sage, a little nutmeg, stick bits of butter 



IO2 DIFFERENT WAYS TO COOK MEAT. 

over it, and then sprinkle over it thickly a teaspoonful of grated 
bread crumbs. Put it in the stove, and when it begins to brown 
immediately baste it over with melted butter; a very 
few minutes will be required to baste it. A portion of the brains 
may be mashed and added to the gravy. Celery and vinegar will 
season the gravy well. The housekeeper, who directs in such mat- 
ters, should give particular instructions as to the sauce to be used in 
each dish, adding ingredients to suit the tastes of those who are to 
be served. There is but one style of gravy or sauce, or not more 
than two, in the majority of families, and these never vary. Nothing 
easier than to give a pleasing variety when a good supply of vinegars 
and catsups are kept on hand. Then boil the other half of the 
head in a white cloth and serve them both in one dish. Boil the 
other half of the brains in a piece of clean cloth, with a very little 
parsley and a leaf or two of sage. When they are boiled, chop 
them small and warm them up in a saucepan with a bit of butter 
and a bit of pepper and salt. Lay the tongue, boiled and peeled, 
in the middle of a small dish and the brains around it. Have in 
another dish bacon and pickled pork, and in a third, greens and 
carrots. 

LAMB'S HEAD. Wash the head very clean, take the back part 
from the eyes and the gail from the liver. Lay the head in warm 
water ; boil the lights, heart and part of the liver, chop and flour 
them, and toss them up in a saucepan with some gravy, catsup and 
a little pepper, salt, lemon juice and a spoonful of cream. Boilthe 
head very white, lay it in the middle of the dish and the minced meat 
around it ; place the other parts of the fried liver, with some very 
small bits of butter, on the minced meat, and the brains fried in little 
cakes, laid on the rim of the dish, with some crisped parsley put be- 
tween. Pour a little melted butter over the head and garnish with 
lemon. 

LAMB'S HEAD MINCED. Chop the head in halves and blanch it 
with the liver, heart and lights ; clean the brains in warm water, dip 
them in the yolk of an egg. grated bread and chopped parsley, 
seasoned with white pepper and salt, and while the head is blanching, 
fry them in boiling lard, and drain. Chop the heart, etc., and add a 
little parsley and lemon peel chopped very fine, seasoned with white 
pepper and salt ; stew in some cauls until tender. Wash the bread 
over with yolk of egg, strew over grated bread seasoned with white 
pepper and salt, and bake until tender. Serve up, having browned 
the head with a salamander ; put the mince under it and the brains 
around it with slices of broiled bacon.

enough to fall to pieces, then strain off the water ; now put the goose 
into a pot, pour over it the broth of the calf's feet and enough water 
to cover the goose well ; add some vinegar, spices, salt, onions and 
a half peel of a lemon ; cover it and boil slowly until the goose is 
soft. Let it cool off in the broth, and take out the goose after it is 
cold. Cut all the meat off the bones and lay it in a deep earthern 
dish. Take all the fat off the broth, taste it, add more vinegar and 
salt if necessary, let it run through a cloth and pour it over the 
meat. It will be nice and stiff after 24 hours, and you can eat 
it cold with bread or cream. If you can get gellatine it will 
be so much simpler to prepare it. Boil the goose in water and 
spiced just as before. The toughest meat will get tender if 
boiled with vinegar. The American cooks always steam the goose 
before roasting. Try it once without steaming. Rub it with salt, 
both inside and outside ; put a little water in your frying pan 
and roast it in a hot oven two or three hours, according to size, 
and if it is a young goose you will find it superb. 

PIG'S PETTITOES. A thin slice of bacon, i onion, i blade of mace, 
6 peppercorns, 3 or 4 sprigs of thyme, i pint of gravy, pepper and 
salt to taste thickening of butter and flour. Put the liver, heart and 
pettitoes into a stewpan with the bacon, mace, peppercorns, thyme, 
onion and gravy, and simmer these gently for 1-4 of an hour ; then 
take out the heart and liver and mince them very fine. Keep stew- 
ing the feet until quite tender, which will be from 20 to 30 minutes, 
reckoning from the time that they boil up first ; then put back the 
minced liver, thicken the gravy with a little butter and flour, season 
with pepper and salt, and simmer over a gentle fire for five minutes, 
occasionally stirring the contents. Dish the-mince, split the feet and 
arrange them around alternately with sippets of toasted bread and 
pour the gravy in the middle. Altogether 40 minutes. 

SHEEP'S FEET OR TROTTERS. 12 feet, 1-4 Ib. of beef or mutton 
suet, 2 onions, i carrot, 2 bay leaves, 2 sprigs of thyme, i oz. salt, 
1-4 oz. pepper, 2 tablespoonfuls flour, 2 1-2 quarts of water, 1-4 Ib. 
fresh butter, i teaspoonful each of salt, flour and pepper, a little 
grated nutmeg, the juice of i lemon, i gill of milk and the yolks of 
2 eggs. Have the feet cleaned and the long bone extracted from 
them, put the suet into a stewpan, with the onions and carrot sliced, 
the bay leaves, thyme, salt and pepper, and let these simmer for five 
minutes ; add 2 tablespoonfus of flour and the water, and keep stir- 
ring till it boils, then put in the feet. Let these simmer for 3 hours, 
or until perfectly tender, take them and lay them on a sieve, mix to- 
gether on a plate with the back of a spoon, butter, salt, flour (2 tea- 
spoonfuls), pepper, nutmeg and lemon juice, as above, and put the 
feet, with a gill of milk, into a stewpan ; when very hot, add the

butter, etc., and stir continually until melted. Now mix the yolks of 

2 eggs with 5 tablespoonfuls of milk ; stir this into the other ingre- 
dients, keep moving the pan over the fire continually for a minute or 
two, but do not allow it to boil after the eggs are added. Serve in a 
hot dish and garnish with croutons or sippets of toasted bread. Cook 

3 hours. Seasonable at any time. 

To FRY KIDNEYS. Chop veal, mutton, beef or hog's kidneys and 
some of the fat, likewise a little leek or onion (or not), cayenne 
pepper (a little), and salt. Wet it with an egg or two, roll it up into 
balls and fry them, or they may be parboiled and simply fried with 
sweet breads. 

STEWED Ox KIDNEYS. Cut a kidney or two into thin pieces, soak 
the slices in water and dry them well ; dust them with flour, pepper 
and salt, put them into the stew pan with a little fresh butter and 
shake them about over the fire till brown, then pour some hot water, 
broth or pot liquor into the pan ; a shallot or two chopped fine, some 
young onions, a little parsley and a spoonful of shallot vinegar, on- 
ion or walnut pickle or catsup. Cover the stewpan close and simmer 
slowly 'till done. 

LAMB TO KEEP IN SUMMER. In a few hours after the lamb is 
slaughtered take all four quarters and cook them well ; each subse- 
quent day afterwards, as you prepare your dinner, place the remain- 
ing quarters back in the stove and thoroughly heat them. Pepper 
well ; add a little salt. In this way they will keep sweet for a week 
in the hottest weather. 

A VERY NICE DISH. Take the but end of a neck of lamb, cut it 
into steaks and chop each bone so short as to make the steaks al- 
most round. Egg and strew over with crumbs, herbs and seasoning; fry 
them of the finest brown, mash some potatoes with a little butter and 
cream and put them into the middle of the dish raised high. Then 
place the edge of one steak on another with the small bone upward 
all around the potatoes. 

HODGE PODGE. One pound of under-done cold mutton, 2 let- 
tuces, i pint of green peas, 5 or 6 green onions, 2 ounces of butter; 
pepper and salt to taste ; 1-2 teacupful of water; mince the mutton 
and cut up the lettuces and onions in slices. Put these into a stew 
pan with all the ingredients except the peas, let these simmer very 
gently for 3-4 of an hour, keeping them well stirred. Boil the peas 
separately ; mix these with the mutton and serve very hot ; stew 3-4 
hour. 

A LAMB'S HAGGIS. Slit up all the little fat strips with scissors 
and clean them ; clean the kernels also and parboil the whole and 
cut them into little bits. Clean and shred the web ^.nd kidney fat 
and mix it with the tripe ; season with salt, pepper and grated nut-

meg. Make a thin batter with 2 eggs, 1-2 pint of milk and the 
necessary quantity of flour. Season with chopped cloves or young 
onions ; mix the whole together, sew up the bag, which must be clean, 
and boil for 1-2 hour. 

PORK AND BACON. 

OLIVE OIL is superior to butter, lard or dripping for basting a pig 
or fowl ; it gives it an evener and a finer color, and more crispness 
to the skin. 

OLIVE OIL FOR COOKING. Almost every kind of dish is cooked 
in olive oil by the inhabitants of Syria, Arabia and a portion of 
Africa. 

To BOIL A LEG OF PORK (Mrs. H.'s recipe). Pork requires longer 
boiling than any other meat. If it has befen salted 6 or 8 days soak 
it an hour before cooking. Scrape and wash it carefully, singe off any 
hairs with a piece of burning paper or corn husk, and avoid making 
incisions about the knuckle, as this lets out the juice. Put it to boil 
in lukewarm water, and boil slowly and steadily, skimming carefully ; 
keep the cover on ; this will not only keep out the smoke, but will 
retain much of the nutritive properties of the meat. Should the 
least dross remain upon the meat when done, scrape it off again. It 
should go to the table white, clean and thoroughly done, and yet 
not boiled until the meat drops from the bone ; it should be rather 
underdone. This is good cold or slightly heated and buttered. A 
pea pudding, from time immemorial, has been considered the proper 
accompaniment for this dish. Boiled turnips, with or without butter, 
cream and pepper, are excellent. When cold, nothing can be better 
than chow-chow or French mustard as an accompaniment. 

To BOIL PICKLED PORK. Should the pork be very salt, let it re- 
main in water about 2 hours before it is dressed. Put it into a sauce- 
pan with sufficient cold water to cover it, let it gradually come to a 
boil and then gently simmer until tender. Allow ample time for it 
to cook, as nothing is more disagreeable than underdone pork, and 
when boiled fast the meat becomes hard. This is sometimes served 
with boiled poultry and roast veal, instead of bacon. When tender, 
and not over salt, it will be found equally good, A piece of pickled 
pork weighing 2 Ibs., i 1-2 hours to boil. Seasonable at any time. 

BAKING PORK. Rub over its surface some melted butter, strew it 
with bread crumbs and bake it in a very hot oven until of a brown 
golden yellow color. You can season it with salt and pepper. It 
is better to roast it rather too much than too little. Roast leg of 
pork 3 hours, or. until tender. 

To ROAST A LEG OF PORK. Cut the skins in squares, season with 
salt and pepper and baste with salt and water while baking. 



IO6 PORK AND BACON. 

SPRING OR FOREHAND OF PORK. Cut out the bone, sprinkle salt, 
pepper and dried sage over the inside ; but first warm a little butter 
to baste it with and then flavor it ; roll the pork tight and tie it, 
then roast it by hanging before the fire. About 2 hours will do it. 

To ROAST A COLLARED NECK OF PORK. Let the meat be boned, 
then strew the inside pretty well with bread crumbs, chopped sage, a 
very little beaten allspice, some salt and pepper, all mixed together. 
Roll it up very close, bind it tightly and roast gently i 1-2 hours or 
more, according to the thickness. A loin of pork with the fat and 
kidney taken out and boned, and a spring of pork boned are very 
nice dressed in the same way. 

To FRY PORK CHOPS. Parboil them and then flour them with 
pepper and salt and fry them with chopped onions in lard. 

PORK CHOPS may be fried in the same manner, dipping them, after 
they are egged, in a mixture of chopped sage, onions and crumbs of 
bread with pepper and salt. 

PORK CUTLETS OR CHOPS. Loin of pork, pepper and salt to 
taste. Cut the cutlets from a delicate loin of pork, bone and brown 
them nicely and cut away the greater portion of the fat. Season 
them with pepper and place the gridiron on the fire ; when quite hot 
lay on the chops and broil them for 1-4 of an hour, turning them 3 
or 4 times, and be particular that they are thoroughly done, but not 
dry. Dish them, sprinkle over a little fine salt and serve plain or 
with tomato catsup, some piquant sauce, or pickled gherkins, a few 
of which should be laid around the dish as a garnish. One-quarter 
of an hour. 

ROAST P;G. Stuff with a stuffing of bread crumbs, sifted sage, salt, 
pepper and nutmeg, and sew it up, lay it on a brisk fire until 
done thoroughly, then have ready some butter in a dry cloth and 
rub the pig with it in every part. (The legs must be skewered 
back or the under part will not crisp.) Dredge as much flour 
over it as will probably lie, and do not touch it again till ready to 
serve; then scrape off the flour very carefully with a blunt knife, 
rub the pig well with the buttered cloth, and take off the head 
while at the fire ; take ouf the brains and mix them with the 
gravy that comes from the pig. Then take it up, and, without 
draining the spit, cut it down the back and belly and lay it into 
the dish and chop the sage and bread quickly and as fine as 
you can, and mix them with a large quantity of fine, melted but- 
ter that has very little flavor. Put the sauce into the dish after 
the pig has been split down the back, and garnish with the ears 
and the two jaws ; take off the upper part of the head down to 
the neck. Some add to the above stuffing a couple of onions, 
parboiled, 2 spoonfuls of butter and the yolk of an egg. Apple

sauce, carrot sauce, bread sauce and tomato sauce are occasion- 
ally used. A pig will take about 2 hours to roast. When the 
eyes start from the head it is done enough. The pig may be 
roasted in a paper bag that has been well greased with beef 
drippings. Before roasting, meat that has been frozen should be 
soaked 2 or 3 hours or longer ia cold water, and will require a 
longer time to roast. 

N. B. Do not attempt to thaw it before the fire, or you will 
never be able to roast it perfectly afterward. Squeeze in it a lit- 
tle lemon juice, and put in a sprinkle of salt and a Httle cayenne 
pepper, which should be on the table. Roasting was the ancient 
manner of dressing meat. 

ROAST PIG. Kill your pig the evening previous or very early in 
the morning of your wanting it to cook. Scrape, singe and wash it 
several times in cold water, changing it as often ; then cut the feet 
off at the first joint. The heart, liver and feet should be put in a pot 
or a pan to stew. Fill the body with a rich stuffing, as for turkey or 
goose, or with Irish potatoes mashed fine while hot, after boiling or 
steaming them, which should be highly seasoned with salt, pepper, 
lard or butter (i spoonful each). After fastening the legs together, 
sew the body up and rub it well with salt and pepper all over. Put 
it in a tin roaster before a hot fire, turn it frequently, and now and 
then rub it with lard or butter tied up in a piece of muslin, in order 
to make the skin crisp all over. If you wish you can suspend it be- 
fore the fire with a string tied to a strong nail, and under it place a 
stew-pan or skillet to catch the gravy. The feet cut up and the 
heart and liver chopped very fine, should be boiled in clear water 
with a few sage leaves. Take them up and lay them on a sieve and 
season highly ; form a paste of butter and flour and stir it in, and 
cook until tender, then take the dripping in the pan or skillet and 
thicken it with flour and give it a boil up. Serve for gravy in a sauce 
tureen. 

ROAST HAM Soak in lukewarm water a ham, the night before 
you bake it. Four or six hours before you wish to serve it set it in an 
oven or before a moderate fire in a tin kitchen or roasting-pan, turn the 
spit frequently and let it roast 2 hours. Then take it up on a dish 
or pan and remove the skin nicely. Scrape all the fat off the baking 
pan and let it bake 2 or 3 hours longer, basting it often with the 
gravy in the bottom of the pan. When it is done, take the ham up 
on a dish. It should be brown. Put the gravy in a saucepan, stir i 
tablespoonful of flour in a teacup of water, pour it in the same and 
boil up. Serve this in a sauce tureen. This is excellent for cold 
lunch, well peppered, with cider. 

FRIED EGGS AND BACON. This is an old-fashioned and handy 



108 PORK AND BACON. 

dish when a hasty meal is called for. By a little attention it can be 
made a nice dish, and for want of it, will be spoiled. The bacon 
to be fried should be scalded a minute or two in a fryingpan on each 
side ; then pour off the water before the fat begins to run ; then fry 
it a moment until it acquires a 'pale brown ; then remove it on to a 
fish strainer, break the eggs carefully into separate cups, so that the 
yolks be not broken, and slide them gently into the pan. When the 
whole of the white is set, and the under part of a pale brown, take 
each up with a knife, and hold them a moment over the panto drain 
the fat from them. Some persons turn them all over, but if the eggs 
are nicely done, the curled edges are rather an improvement than 
otherwise. Each egg may be laid on a slice of bacon, or laid sepa- 
rately on the fish plate with the bacon around and garnished with 
paisley. 

To ROAST A LOIN OF PORK. Cut the skin lengthwise and cross- 
wise so as to form small squares and rub it all over with pepper, salt 
and finely powdered dry sage leaves ; make an incision between the 
ribs and stuff it with dressing made of bread crumbs, chopped on- 
ions, pepper and salt, mixed up with the yolk of i or 2 eggs well 
beaten. Bake it in a stove or oven, or before the fire on a spit and 
baste it often with lard. It may be baked after it is dressed; fat 
roast is the sweetest. 

COLLARED PIG'S FACE. One pig's face and salt. For brine, i 
gallon of water, i pound of common salt, 1-2 handful of chopped 
juniper berries, 6 bruised cloves, 2 bay leaves, a few sprigs of thyme, 
basil, sage, 1-4 ounce saltpetre. For force meat, 1-2 pound of ham, 
1-2 pound of bacon, i teaspoonful of mixed spices; pepper to taste; 
1-4 Ib. of lard, i tablespoonful of mixed parsley, 6 young onions ; 
singe the head carefully, bone it without breaking the skin and rub 
it well with salt. Make the brine by boiling the above ingredients 
for 1-4 hour and letting it stand to cool. When cold, pour it over 
the head and let it steep in this for 10 days, turning and rubbing it 
often, then wipe, drain and dry it. For the force meat, pound the 
ham and bacon very finely and mix with them the remaining in- 
gredients, taking care that the whole is thoroughly incorporated. 
Spread this equally over the head, roll it lightly in cloth and bind 
it securely with broad tape ; put it into a sauce pan with a few 
meat trimmings and cover it over with stock; let it simmer gently 
for 4 hours and be particular that it does not stop boiling the 
whole time. When quite tender take it up, put it between two 
dishes with a heavy weight on the top, and when cold remove 
the cloth and tape. It should be sent to the table on a napkin 
or garnished with a piece of deep white paper with a ruche on 
the top. Four hours for preparing it. 



PORK AND BACON. ICX) 

To BAKE QUARTERS OF PIG. Wash the meat nicely, cut the skin 
lengthwise and crosswise into small squares and rub it with pep- 
per and salt. If approved a little dust of dried sage ; put it in the 
oven with a little water and lard and bake it brown. 

ROAST SUCKING PIG. Put a sucking pig, as soon as it is killed, 
in a basin of hot, but not boiling water for 2 minutes, then rub off 
the hairs with a cloth ; if they do not come off easily put the pig 
in the water for i minute more ; make a slit down the belly, take out 
the entrails, clean and singe the pig and steep it in cold water for 24 
hours ; after which drain and dry it thoroughly with a cloth. Make 
stuffing as follows : Chop a large onion together with about a dozen 
sage leaves, blanch the whole in boiling water for 5 minutes, drain 
and put in a stew pan with a good spoonful of butter, stir over the 
fire and simmer for 10 minutes, then add a cupful or more of bread 
crumbs ; season with salt and pepper, mix thoroughly and fill the 
inside of the pig with the stuffing, sew it up with fine twine, truss the 
legs and back and put the pig in the spit to roast before a clear fire, 
basting it with butter or salad oil. When the pig is done take it off 
the spit, put it on a dish and serve with approved sauce in a 
boat. 

To DRESS PIG'S FRY. One and one-half pound of pig's fry, 2 
onions, a few sage Ieaves2, 2 pounds of potatoes ; pepper and salt to 
taste. Put the lean fry at the bottom of a pie dish, sprinkle over it 
some minced sage and onion and a seasoning of pepper and salt ; 
sliced potatoes ; put a layer of these in the seasoning, then the fat 
fry, then more seasoning and a layer of potatoes at the top ; fill the 
dish with boiling water and bake for 2 hours, or rather longer ; cook 
rather more than 2 hours. 

To BOIL A GAMMON, OR BOILING HAM, or any Salted or Smoked 
Meat, as Neat's Tongue, Hog's Cheeks, &c Set on a kettle of 
water, put in 3 or 4 handfuls of hay flowers, cloves, or any sweet 
grass green leaves of Indian corn, or the husks ; or if you cannot get 
them green, hay tied up in a coarse bag or cloth will do. By this 
means the meats will be of a much finer color, more tender, short 
and mellow. 

An old ham should be* soaked several hours before boiling, and 
after being skimmed paint the top with yolks of well beaten eggs ; 
sift over finely pulverized cracker and bread crumbs evenly, or cover 
over a thin coat of Irish potatoes, straining through a colander ; bake 
in a moderate oven 1-2 hour ; skin the ham or not, as you may fancy. 
If the skin remains, with a sharp knife you can cut the skin in dia- 
mond shapes, then fill it with grated yolks of hard boiled eggs, or 
grated beets or carrots ; trim the dish with parsley or the tops of eel-, 
ery. If the ham be skinned stick it with cloves in diamond shapes, 



I IO PORK AND BACON. 

fill up the places with a layer of grated yolks and i white of hard 
boiled eggs. Be careful not to blend them. Garnish the dish with 
sprigs of green double parsley interspersed with pretty flowers cut 
from vegetables ; make red, pink, cream colored and white roses of 
beets; purple and yellow roses of carrots, and pearl white with 
turnips ; for leaves use mustard or curled parsley. Ornament the 
knuckle with letter paper of different colors, or white ; cut with letter 
paper. 

Miss F.'s RECIPE for preparing whole hams for parties. Boil 
them till very done and skin them ; when cold cut through the ham 
in slices to the bone, but do not cut the slices from the bone. Be- 
tween each slice, put thin pieces of pickle and detach the slices as 
needed. The ham dressed by either of these receipts will show to 
better advantage by being slightly elevated above the dish. Gar- 
nish with parsley or something green. Save the essence or gravy for 
boiling cabbage, beans, peas, or Irish potatoes, and soups, &c. 

GLAZE FOR COVERING COLD HAMS, TONGUES, &c. Use either 
rich stock or white stock, denoting the quantity of meat in each. 
It may be remarked at the outset that unless glaze is wanted in very 
large quantities it is seldom made expressly ; either of the stocks 
above mentioned boiled down and realtered considerably, will be 
found to produce a very goed glaze. Put the stock into a stew pan 
over a nice clear fire, let it boil till it becomes somewhat stiff, when 
keep stirring to prevent its burning. The moment it is sufficiently 
reduced and comes to a glaze turn it out into the glazing pot or 
white earthenware jar to melt the glaze when required. It should 
never be warmed in a sauce pan, lest it should reduce too much 
and become black and bitter. If the glaze is wanted of a pale color 
more veal than beef should be mixed in making the stock ; and it is 
as well to omit turnips and celery, as thev impart a disagreeable bit- 
ter flavor. 

To GLAZE HAM (boiling). -^Brush over the ham (using a feather 
or brush) with the yolk of an egg, cover thickly with bread crumbs 
and go over it with thick cream ; put it in the stove or oven to brown, 
put the glaze on 1-2 inch thick and if necessary put it on a second 
time. 

How TO BOIL HAM to give it an excellent flavor. Vinegar and 
water, 2 heads of celery, 2 turnips, 3 onions, a large bunch of 
savory herbs. Let the ham soak from 8 to 12 hours, wash it 
thoroughly clean, and trim away from the under sides all the rusty 
and smoked parts, which would spoil the appearance, and let it 
soak for a few hours in vinegar and water ; put it on in cold wa- 
ter, and when it boils add the vegetables and herbs; simmer very 
gently until tender, take it out, strip off the skin, cover with bread 
raspings and put a paper ruche around the knuckle. 



PORK AND BACON. Ill 

A VALUABLE SUGGESTION. Cut ham or salt pork in slices for 
frying or broiling, put to soak over night in equal proportions of 
sweet or sour milk and water, for breakfast, and several hours 
before any other meal. 

To SWEETEN SALT PORK. Cut as many slices as will be re- 
quired for breakfast the evening previous and soak till morning 
in sweet milk and water, then rinse clean in clear water and fry. 
The pork will be found nearly as good as when fresh. 

To BAKE A HAM. Many people think a ham is never so thor- 
oughly well cooked as in the oven. It should first lie in cold water 
for 12 hours, then in warm milk and water for 6 hours. Cover it en- 
tirely with a coarse paste or put it into an oiled paper bag, so that 
.none of the gravy may escape, and place it on a baking dish and 
bake it in a well heated oven for 4 or 5 hours, according to size ; 
when taken from the oven remove the paste or bag and the skin. 
Brush it over with white of egg, cover it with raspings of bread, and 
brown for a few minutes before the fire or stove. 

BAKED HAM (Mrs. Denny, San Jose, Cal ) Wash your ham 
clean, wipe it dry, then boil it for 2 hours in clear water, then take 
off, carefully remove the skin, then put it into a clean oven ; mix 
together i pound each of nice sugar and finely powdered bread 
crumbs and put them evenly over the ham and bake a nice brown. 
It is just as nice as can be. The ham should be new and sweet. 
Begin at the hock bone to cut. 

TOAST HAM. Chop some lean ham, put in a pan with a little 
pepper, a lump of butter and 2 eggs beaten. When beaten thor- 
oughly, spread it on buttered toasts and serve hot. 

To ROAST A HAM. Trim the ham and soak it for 24 hours to re- 
move the salt, then put it into a deep earthen pan with 3 onions and 
3 carrots sliced, and 1-2 ounce of black pepper. Pour over a bot- 
tle of light French wine, cover it closely up, and let it remain in this 
marinade 24 hours, then roast |it before the fire, basting it with 
the marinade. It will require from 4 to 5 hours to be well cooked. 
Skin it and braise the ham over, and in the meantime reduce the 
marinade and gravy over the fire to a sauce and pour it around 
the ham when served. It may be eaten hot or cold ; excellent 
when cold for lunch. 

STUFFED HAM. After boiling the ham skin it, and have ready 
a dressing made of corn meal muffins or grated biscuits, add i 
moderate sized onion chopped very fine, 2 leaves of sage, pepper, 
sugar and salt to taste, a few celey sticks ; with a large knife make 
incisions all over the ham and press the dressing in. Mrs. 
Rogers. 

ROAST HAM. Soak a ham in tepid water the night before you

wish to roast it. Four hours before you wish to serve it set it 
before a moderate fire, turn the spit and let it roast two hours, 
then bake it upon a dish or pan and take the skin off nicely : scrape 
all the fat out of the roaster, put in the ham and let it roast 2 hours 
more ; baste it often with the drippings in a sauce pan, stir i table- 
spoonful of flour in a teacupful of water, pour it in the sauce and 
boil up. Serve in a tureen. 

SWEET BREADS: 

BAKED SWEET BREADS. Let them lay in water i hour before 
using, parboil them, cut slits over them and lay in strips of bacon ; 
put the sweet breads in a hollow baking dish, pour in a tumbler of 
water in which they were boiled, rub a tablespoonful of flour in a 
tablespoonful of butter and add salt and pepper to suit taste, 
and serve as soon as done ; i pint of oysters added to the gravy will 
improve it. 

LAMB'S SWEET BREADS. Blanch them and put them a little while 
into cold water, then put them into a stew pan with a teacupful of 
broth ; some pepper, salt, a small bunch of onions and a blade ot 
mace ; stir in a bit of butter and flour and stew 1-2 hour. Have 
ready 2 or three eggs well beaten in cream with a little minced pars- 
ley and a few grates of nutmeg. Put in some boiled asparagus tops 
to the other things; do not let it boil after the cream is in, but make 
it hot, and stir it well all the time. Take care that it does not cur- 
dle. Young French beans or peas may be added, first boiled of a 
beautiful color. 

SWEET BREADS SAUTE. Soak your sweet breads in tepid water 
several hours to free them from blood, then pour boiling water over 
them and let stand for 3 minutes, then melt some butter in a frying 
pan, and put in the sweet breads ; season over with salt, pepper, 
juice of lemon, parsley and bay leaf ; turnover till done and serve 
hot with maitre d'hotel sauce over. 

SWRET BREADS BOILED (Mrs. Bates'.) Parboil, rub them well 
with butter and broil on a clean gridiron ; turn them often, and now 
and then roll them over in a plate containing hot melted butter to 
prevent them from getting hard and dry. 

To BROIL A SWEET BREAD. Parboil it, rub it with butter and 
broil it over a slow fire ; turn it frequently and baste it now and 
then by putting it upon a plate kept warm by the fire with butter in 
it, 



HASHES. 



BKAINS. 

To COOK BRAINS. They may be fried in butter, boiled in milk, 
and then placed in vinegar or boiled in water 2 or 3 minutes, then 
beaten fine, mingled with sage, salt, yolk of an egg, a gill of cream, 
fried in the form of drop cakes in butter. They should be carefully 
washed before cooking. When well cooked nothing is more deli- 
cious. 

LAMB'S BRAINS How TO PREPARE THEM. One-half pint of pure 
vinegar and tne same of water, salt, and 1-2 lemon or a whole 
lime and a heap tablespoonful of chopped parsley. Previously 
boil the brains in some vinegar diluted with water, and some salt ; 
mince them and add to them the yolk of a beaten egg with a 
spoonful of milk or cream and the lemon juice. Liver plack may 
be prepared in the same way, but should first be parboiled, then 
stewing down with onions, pepper, salt, a little nutmeg, sage and 
parsley and thyme till the gravy is clear. 

BRAINS. Steep them in cold water for an hour, then pick out 
all the skinny particles from the surface, being careful not to bruise 
the brains ; when very clean and white put them into a stew pan with 
i quart of water, a pinch of salt, a spoonful of vinegar, and boil 
gently for 28 minutes. 

LANFI means anything cooked in a small quantity of water, oil, 
lard, or fat i side at a time. Serve hot with sugar sifted over. Ris- 
sole flazzie must be sauted till of a golden yellow, being egged 
over. 

HASHES. 

Hashes, by the manner in which they are prepared, are frequently 
impoverished, hardened and rendered indigestible. It is no uncom- 
mon thing to see a hash stewed away for an hour or more, or hear a 
cook say she must set the hash on in good time to make the gravy 
rich. It is no wonder that there are so many persons t be met with 
whom hash constantly disagrees. This would not be the case were 
the preparing carried on in a proper manner. Let these two obser- 
vations be borne in mind for hashes in general : First, that the gravy 
should bring richness to the meat, not enriched by it. Second, that 
instead of stewing on the hob or corner of the stove, the fewer min- 
utes the hash is in the stewpan the better ; even the meat, when un- 
derdone, when cut in thin slices, a minute or two will sufficiently do 
it. Cold beef, mutton or fowls of any kind will make a most excel- 
lent hash as well as beefs heart. 



114 HASHES. 

MRS. H.'s RECIPE FOR BEEF HASH. Two tumblers of hot water, 
a large tablespoonful of butter, 3 tablespoonfuls each of grated cheese 
and bread crumbs, season highly with cayenne pepper, and add 3 
tumblerfuls of minced beef. Serve as soon as hot. Stir all well to- 
gether. This is from a very accomplished housekeeper. 

MRS. J.'s BAKED HASH. Take cold round of good beef or mut- 
ton and mince it fine, seasoned with a little minced onion, pep- 
per and salt. Chop green pickle (onion is the best), add a little 
vinegar. Put into a deep dish a layer of meat, then one of 
pickle, sliced thin, one of bread crumbs over that, butter and 
gravy. Repeat this until all is in, putting bread crumbs and 
butter last ; let it bake a few moments until a nice crust is formed, 
and serve hot. Should there be but little gravy, moisten with a 
little ssveet milk and water mixed in equal proportions. Very 
little is necessary. 

IRISH POTATO HASH (A Michigan recipe). Peel and wash 
Irish potatoes, slice thin and put to stew in a very little water ; 
when nearly done, add as much pickled beef, minced very fine, 
or cold salt mackerel if liked, (a little onion and minced parsley 
may be put in with the Irish potatoes), a large tablespoonful of 
butter, pepper and salt to taste. Serve hot. This should just be 
moist. Mash the potatoes and mix them well with the meat, 
This Is a favorite dish. 

To HASH DUCKS. Cut them into pieces, as in carving at table, 
and soak them by the side of the fire in boiling gravy, until they 
are thoroughly hot. Add a glass of wine and a sufficient quantity 
of minced spices to give the sauce a high relish, or cut up the 
ducks and make a gravy of the trimmings, and some onions. 
Thicken it, when strained, with butter browned with flour; stew 
the cut ducks gently until ready, and having seasoned with sauce. 
Serve the hash on small slices of fried bread. 

To HASH A DRESSED GOOSE. Cut up a large onion and put it 
into a stewpan with a little butter ; fry it, but without letting it 
become brown; add thereto as much boiling water as will make 
sauce for the hash, thicken it with flour, cut up the goose and put 
it into the sauce, but do not let it boil. Season with pepper, 
salt and catsup. 

The legs of geese broiled and served with apple sauce form a 
good supper, luncheon or tiffin. 

To HASH TURKEY. Cut the flesh into pieces and take off the 
skin, otherwise it will give the gravy a greasy, disagreeable taste. 
Put it into a stewpan with a pint of gravy, a teaspoonful of lemon 
pickle, a slice of the end of lemon and a little beaten mace. Let 
it boil 6 or 7 minutes, and then put it into your dish. Thicken your 



HASHES. 115 

gravy with flour and butter, mix the yolks of 2 eggs with a spoonful 
of thick, new cream, put it into your gravy and shake it over the fire 
till it is quite hot, but do not let it boil, then strain it and pour it over 
your turkey. Lay slices of fried bread around and serve it, and 
garnish with lemon and parsley. 

EXCELLENT TURKEY HASH. Chop 2 large or 4 medium-sized 
onions, put in a frying-pan with enough beef dripping and butter to 
fry the onions tender, then add 3 cups of chopped turkey, with salt, 
black pepper, a little thyme or nutmeg ; add boiling water enough 
to moisten without making much gravy, dredge in some flour and 
stir it. Boil and serve it, or turn it over half slices of well-buttered 
toast. 

To HASH A CALF'S HEAD. Clean and parboil the head, or take 
what is left of a plainly-boiled cold head, and cut it into small pieces 
or slugs. Peel and slice the tongue. Take upwards of a quart of 
liquor in which the head was boiled, with the bones and trimmings, 
and a shank of veal or mutton, and boil these for the hash stock 
with sage, thyme, parsley, white pepper, onions and a little grated 
lemon peel ; boil this gravy until it is good and well flavored, then 
thicken it with flour kneaded in butter and strain it into a saucepan. 
Season with pounded mace, catsup or lemon pickle, or a little piquant 
sauce, and warm up the hash without boiling, though boiling does 
not harden calf's head as it does meat. Garnish with forcemeat balls 
fried, and fried bread, which form a suitable accompaniment to all 
hashes. Pickled oysters added make a great improvement. 

To HASH MUTTON. Cut thin slices of dressed mutton, fat and 
lean, and flour them. Have ready an onion boiled in 2 or 3 spoon- 
fuls of water ; add to it a little gravy and the meat seasoned. 

To HASH VENISON. Slice the meat and warm it through without 
boiling, in its own gravy, or in any other that is unseasoned. If 
there is no fat left from the preceding dinner, that of mutton may 
be substituted, by setting it over the fire with a little California wine 
and sugar, and letting it simmer until dry; then put it to the hash, 
and it will not be distinguishable from the fat of venison. Onions 
are a decided improvement. 

To HASH COLD FOWL OF ANY KIND, AND ALSO BEEF OR MUTTON. 
Cut cold fowls to pieces, and if you have no gravy put in some 
water or milk or an equal portion of both (the milk must be sweet 
and new), boil until the bones, if there be any, can be taken up on a 
dish and removed, while the gravy and meat can be poured with the 
true gravy in the saucepan ; then put in butter, pepper and salt. 
When it boils, stir up new cream with a little flour and thicken it, 
and a well beaten egg can be added, and chopped pickled cucum- 
bers. As soon as thoroughly hot, if approved, squeeze in a little

lemon juice, grated nutmeg and lemon peel. Pour the whole into a 
dish, strew over it some crumbs of bread browned, and then serve it 
hot on the table. 

CROQUETS. 

CROQUETS OF TURKEY. The remains of cold turkey ; to each 
1-2 pound of meat allow 2 ounces of ham or bacon, 2 shallots, i 
ounce of butter, one tablespoonful of flour, the yolks of 2 eggs, 
and bread crumbs. The smaller pieces that will not do for a fricassee 
or hash will answer very well for this dish. Mince the meat finely 
with the ham or bacon in the above proportions, make a gravy of the 
bones and trimmings, well seasoning it, mince the shallots, put them 
into a stew pan with the butter, add the flour, mix well, then put in 
the mince and about 1-2 pint of gravy made from the bones. (The 
proportion of the butter must be increased or diminished according 
to the quantity of mince.) When just boiled add the yolks of 2 
eggs, put the mixture out to cool, and then shape it in a wineglass, 
cover the croquets with egg and bread crumbs and fry them a deli- 
cate brown. Put small pieces of parsley stems for stalks and serve 
with salted bacon cut very thin. Eight minutes to fry the croquets. 

SWEET BREAD CROQUETS. Take some blanched throat of sweet 
breads, trim and cut them in 1-4 inch slices ; cut an equal quantity of 
mushrooms in the same way and mix both together in some stiffly 
reduced German sauce ; make it fry the croquets as above. 

POTATO CROQUETS. Roast 12 large Irish potatoes ; when done, 
with a spoon or fork take out the inside and form into a ball ; when 
cold put them into a mortar with a piece of butter about 1-2 the 
size of the ball of potatoes and pound them well together or work 
them well with the hands ; season with a little pepper, salt, chopped 
shallot, chopped parsley and grated nutmeg; mix with the beaten 
yolks of 6 eggs and 2 whole eggs, then form them into croquets 
about the size of beaten yolks of 6 eggs and 2 whole eggs, or a 
small one; bread-crumb them twice over, fry them a light brown 
color in hot lard and serve with a garnature of cresses or parsley or 
chopped cabbage lettuce. 

CROQUETS can be made of rice and potato or lobster, salmon, 
cod, crab, halibut chicken, turkey, duck, goose, game, veal, beef, 
lamb or mutton ; all kinds of fowl, flesh, fish and vegetables. 
When croquets are small they are called in cookery books "olives" 
of meat, vegetables, game, veal, poultry, &c. When these little 
popular roulettes are larger they are called risoles or croquettes, 
the larger size miratons. 

NOTE In the preparation of these little balls or cakes any kind 



SCALLOPS. 117 

of cold meat, &c., can be used, and the housekeeper can carry 
out the Divine command to "gather up the fragments that nothing 
remains." 

RICE CROQUETS. (Mrs. H.'s) Two cups of cold boiled rice, 2 
tablespoonfuls melted butter, 3 eggs beaten light, a little flour, i raw 
egg and 1-2 cup of powdered cracker; 2 tablespoonfuls of white 
sugar, a large pinch of finely grated lemon peel, and salt to taste. Beat 
eggs and sugar together until light, and work the butter well into 
the rice ; next stir up with this the beaten eggs ; Season and make 
into croquets of whatever shape you fancy. They are pretty moulded 
into the form of pears with a clove blossom, and cut at the 
large end and the stalk of another projecting from the small to rep- 
resent the pear stem. You may find it advisable to use a little 
flour in working the rice paste, but be careful not to get it too stiff, 
in which event the croquet, of whatever composed, ceases it to be a 
delicacy. Roll in flour, then in beaten eggs ; lastly in the pow- 
dered cracker, and fry a few at a time in sweet lard or butter. 

Rice croquets are sometimes eaten with powdered sugar sprinkled 
thickly over them as a dessert or sweet sauce served with them. They 
are delicious when properly mixed and cooked. 

CROQUETS of field peas, salsify, turnips, beans and parsnips may 
be made in the same way, using any kind of meat, leaving out the 
sweetening, adding a little chopped onion, shallot or cloves. 

SCALLOPS OR COLLOPS. 

To DRESS COLLOPS QUICK. Cut them as thin as paper with a 
very sharp knife in small bits, throw the skin and any odd bits of the 
veal into a little water with a dust of pepper and salt ; set them on 
the fire while you beat the collops and dip them into a seasoning of 
herbs, bread, pepper, salt and a scrape of nutmeg, but first wet 
them in egg, then put a bit of butter into a frying pan and give the 
collops a very quick fry, for as they are so thin 2 minutes will do 
them on both sides ; then put them into a hot dish before the fire, 
then strain and thicken the gravy, give it a boil in the frying pan and 
pour it over the collops. A little catsup is an improvement ; or fry 
them in butter only seasoned with salt and pepper, then simmer them 
in the gravy, either white or brown, with bits of bacon served with 
them. If white, add lemon peel and mace and some sweet cream. 

To DRESS SCOTCH COLLOPS BROWN. Cut your collops the same 
way as the white ones, but brown your butter befoie you lay in your 
collops ; fry them over a quick fire, shake and turn them, and keep 
on them a fine froth ; when they are a light brown put them into a 
pot and fry them as the white ones ; when you have fried them all 



Jl8 SCALLOPS. 

brown pour all the gravy from them into a clean tossing pan with 1-2 
pint of the gravy made of the bones and bits you cut the collops off ; 2 
teaspoonfuls of lemon pickle, a large one of catsup, the same of 
browning, 1-2 ounce of morels, p i-2 lemon, a little cayenne, and salt 
to your taste. Thicken it with flour and butter and let it boil 5 or 
6 minutes, then put in your collops and shake them over the fire ; 
if they boil it will make them hard ; when they have simmered a lit- 
tle take them out with an egg spoon and lay them on your dish ; 
strain your gravy and pour it hot over them ; lay over the forcemeat 
balls and little slices of bacon curled round with a skewer and boiled. 
Strew a few mushrooms over ; garnish with lemon and barberries and 
serve them up. 

MINCED COLLOPS (Mrs. Chevallie, Va.) Take any under part 
of the beef, cut it in small pieces, season it with nutmeg, pepper and 
salt, put it into a pan with an onion sliced fine and fry a light brown, 
then put to it a gill of gravy, a spoonful of catsup, a few capers or 
mushrooms, and thicken with a little flour and butter. 

FILLET OF VEAL WITH COLLOPS. Take a small fillet of veal and 
cut up what collops you want, then take the udder and fill it with 
force meat, roll it round, tie it with pack thread across the middle. 
Garnish with lemon. 

TURKEY SCALLOP (Mother's.) Cut up the cold fowl very small, 
removing the bones and skins, then put on the bottom of a well but- 
tered dish a layer of fine stale bread crumbs moistened slightly with 
new milk, that it may not absorb all the gravy, spread over this a 
layer of the minced turkey with bits of cold stuffing, pepper, salt, bits 
of butter, then another layer of crumbs, then of the fowl, and thus 
continue to repeat till the dish is nearly full. Before putting on the 
upper crust pour in the gravy left from the cold turkey, add some 
Worcester sauce, catsup and butter. Have ready some crumbs, 
seasoned with salt and beaten up light with 2 eggs, then spread it 
smoothly over the dish, put lumps of butter plentifully upon it and 
bake. Turn a deep plate over the dish until its contents begin to 
bubble at the sides, showing that it is thoroughly cooked, which will 
take 4 5 minutes. 

SCALLOPED OVSTERS. Use a pan or an earthen dish, such as is 
adapted for puddings, say about 3 inches in depth, commence by 
placing stale bread crumbs on the bottom of the pan or dish, then a 
layer of oysters with a little liquor of the oysters over them, drop in 
some lumps of butter on the oysters, continue making layers of bread 
crumbs and layers of (collops) oysters alternately till the dish is filled. 
Cook in a heated oven till thoroughly browned. On each layer of 
oysters season with pepper, salt, mace, parsley ; allspice to taste. 



SAUSAGES. 



SAUSAGES. 

SAUSAGES. A well-known, seasoned minced meat of celebrity 
requires much care in mingling the seasoning and ingredients in due 
proportion to produce that desired harmony of materials that may 
defy the critical to discover what they are composed of. 

FISH SAUSAGES. Remove the bones and mince any kind of fish 
that has been left, then add equal quantities of bread crumbs and 
mashed potatoes, with 2 eggs well beaten to bind it ; then add some 
cream to make of the proper consistency, season with pepper and 
salt, then, with the hands, make into little balls and flatten, and 
fry in boiling fat. 

SPICED SAUSAGE (French). Black pepper, 5 Ibs. ; cloves and 
nutmeg, i 1-2 Ibs. each; ginger, 2 1-2 Ibs.; annise and coriander 
seeds, 3-4 lb. each. Mix. 

SMOKED SCOTCH SAUSAGES To KEEP AND EAT COLD. Salt a 
piece of beef for 2 days and mince it with suet and season highly 
with pepper, salt, onion or shallot. Fill the large and perfectly cleaned 
ox entrail, plait it in links and hang it up to dry. Boil it as wanted, 
either a single link or all together. 

. BOLOGNA SAUSAGES. To serve these sausages is to slice them in 
rounds about i-S of an inch thick, remove the skins, boil them for a 
moment, if preferred, and dish them up with melted butter and pars- 
ley, or they can simply be cut up and placed in a dish to be eaten. 

ROYAL SAUSAGES. Chop the flesh of quails and of a pullet, with 
bacon, a piece of a leg of raw veal, onions or shallots, parsley, mush- 
rooms, and season with pepper and salt, beaten spice and a clove or 
two of garlic ; then add the yolks of 2 eggs with a little cream ; mix 
these well together; roll it in thick pieces and wrap them up in very 
thin slices cut out of fillet of a veal beaten flat, so that the sausages 
may be about the thickness of 2 inches and 5 inches in length ; then 
garnish an oval stewpan with slices of bacon and beefsteaks, and 
put in your sausages, cover them with beefsteaks and lay slices of 
bacon over the beef; cover the stewpan very close and set it between 
two gentle fires, the one under and the other over it, or in a moderate 
stove ; let them stew for 8 or 10 hours ; then take them from the fire 
and set them by in the stewpan to cool ; then take them out gently, 
being careful not to break them, and all the fat; then cut the sau- 
sages into slices with a sharp knife, dish them neatly and serve them 
up cold. 

PORK SAUSAGES. Chop fat and lean pork together, season to 
taste with sage, pepper and salt, and you may add 2 or 3 berries of 
allspice. Half-fill the small entrails of hogs that have been thor- 



I2O CARVING. 

oughly cleaned and soak in salt water, or the meat can be kept in a 
very small pan closely covered, and so rolled and dusted with very 
little flour before it is fried. Serve on stewed red cabbage, poached 
eggs, rice or mashed potatoes ; put in a form, brown with salaman- 
der and garnish with the above. They must be pricked with a fork 
before they are cooked or they will burst. 

SAUSAGE MEAT. Take the fat and lean of the shin of pork, 2 
parts lean, i part fat, chop or grind it fine, and to 12 Ibs. of sausage 
meat take 3 spoonfuls allspice ground, a spoonful each of powdered 
sage, thyme, pepper and 8 spoonfuls of salt. Mix it all well together 
and fill the skins and hang them in a dry place. The skins of the 
entrails are turned on a stick and well scraped and washed in several 
waters and kept in salt and water two hours before filling. 

To MAKE SAUSAGES. Forty pounds of meat, i Ib. of salt, 3 oz. 
pepper, 1-2 pint of pulverized sage and i teacup of molasses or su- 
gar. Beat or grind the meat and mix thoroughly. 

SAUSAGE THAT WILL KEEP GOOD A YEAR. To 10 Ibs. of meat 
add 3 oz. salt, i oz. of ground pepper, 8 tablespoonfuls of sage 
leaves (after being measured, should be powdered), and i spoonful 
powdered ginger. 

CAKVTNG. 

This is very plain and simple. Practice is necessary to enable the 
carver to hit the joints, either between the several bones on any 
of the various joints of poultry or game, or a piece of mutton or 
veal. In this necessity (practice) the only real difficulty consists. 
Each principle must be considered separately. The first principle 
or rule may be laid down (with one exception) with regard to butch- 
er's meat ; that is, always cut across the grain or fibre of the meat, 
and not uniformly with it. This insures a short fibre and avoids 
those long strings in the mouth, which are as unpleasant as they are 
difficult to masticate. Therefore the first glance at the meat will de- 
termine the carver what to do. The one exception to this rule is this, 
that the under sirloin of a beef should always be cut in the direction 
of the fibre, while the upper side is cut across the grain, but this is 
not an easy task to perform, however, with a bad knife, as the meat 
is apt to slip from the bone. The 2d rule to be observed is to see 
that the fork should steady the joint for the knife, or when the fork 
is used as a means of removing the leg of the fowl or carving a hare, 
rabbit, or any other poultry or game the knife must take the office of 
steadying the bird. The 3d rule to be observed is, it is important to 
cut slices either of game, meat or poultry (in an economical point 
of view) down to the line so as to leave no rough or ragged portions 



CARVING. 121 

behind. In small, quiet parties in the home circle the carving should 
be done by the mother or mistress of the house, but in parties of 
any size or pretensions it is now the fashion for the father to carve 
all the dishes on the side table, but this requires a servant equal to 
the task, with assistants in proportion, and also a dining room large 
enough to admit of a side board devoted solely to this purpose. 

DIRECTIONS FOR CARVING JOINTS. 

THE SADDLE OF MUTTON is carved in three different ways, ist, 
by longitudinal slices along each side of the bone, by which the lean 
and fat do not come in the same slice ; 2d, by transverse slices, tak- 
ing in the bone, and which, consequently, must be thick and clumsy ; 
3d, by oblong slices, slightly curved, which is by far the best plan, in 
which the knife begins at the bone near the tail, and after cutting off 
the outside takes a series of parallel slices through the joint. In 
carving a leg of mutton there can be two modes, the choice of which 
must depend greatly upon the number to be served. For a small 
number, it is better to cut the leg directly across the middle about 
half way between first and second joints, but this admits only of a 
few good slices, while the other portions are of loose and of coarse 
fibre. But by turning up the leg and cutting it exactly on the plan 
of the haunch, a much greater proportion of nice and handsome 
slices may be obtained, and, consequently, a larger party may all be 
equally gratified. 

The haunch of mutton or venison is carved very differently by 
different people. The common plan is to cut through the flesh be- 
tween the leg and loin, and then to run the knife from this to the 
lower end of the loin, cutting parallel slices in that direction. A 
much better plan, however, consists of making these cuts in one 
sweep, carrying the knife directly from the outside of the leg to the 
end of the loin, and thus getting a beautiful, long slice of lean with 
the fat at the end. There is also a delicious mine of kidney fat in 
the loin of mutton under the flank, which is often too high in veni- 
son, but if fresh enough it is even richer and more palatable in that 
meat than in mutton. 

The fore quarter of lamb must be commenced by separating the 
shoulder blade, carrying the knife all round it, and in raising it with 
the fork ; after which a lemon should be squeezed into the cut sur- 
face, and a little pepper and salt then sprinkled over it ; but this may 
be much better done in the kitchen than on the dining table. In 
order to carve this part the same directions will apply that are given 
in the last paragraph ; and for the remaining portion it is only neces- 
sary to separate the thin part called the brisket from the ribs, then 



122 CARVING. 

divide each into transverse sections. One rib is usually served to 
each plate, and with this many people like a small division of the 
brisket, but the question ought always to be asked before giving 
either or both. 

In carving a shoulder of mutton or lamb the young housekeeper 
should first ascertain the true position of the bone, which is near the 
edge on one side. Here the knife must not be inserted, because it 
would be stopped at once ; but by trying the opposite side a deep cut 
may be made, and from it two surface slices are readily obtained. 
When this part is exhausted slices may be procured along the sides 
of the blade bone, and again on the outside some few good cuts will 
be met with. 

The chump end has the tail attached to its upper side, and this 
must be taken off horizontally, after which successive slices of 
meat are served without any bone, which is all in one piece, and, 
therefore, not capable of being divided. 

Breast of veal is carved in the same way as the best of the fore 
quarter of lamb after the shoulder is removed. 

A loin of veal is usually divided into two portions, the chump end 
and the kidney end. The latter merely requires to be divided into 
portions ab right angles with its length, every other one of which 
contains a bone, and the intermediate one is of meat only. Most 
persons like some of the fat on the underside, around the kidney, 
soread on bread and seasoned, when it eais like marrow. 

DIRECTIONS FOR CARVING FOWLS AND GAME. 

The roast or boiled chicken, when carved hot, is generally cut into 
separate joints, consisting of, ist, the wings; 2d, the legs; 3d, the 
merry-thought; 4th, the neck bones ; 5th, the breast; 6th, the back 
and its side bones ; yth, the neck. But, excepting for family use, it 
is seldom customary to use more than the wings, merry-thought and 
breast, or, sometimes in addition, the legs. The plan of proceeding 
is to stick the fork in the breast firmly, then draw the knife steadily 
along the line between the leg and the body, continuing it forward 
until it has separated a slice of the breast with the wing bone. If 
the carver is dexterous, he hits the joint at once, and some can re- 
move a wing as if there were no bone at all, the art consisting of 
guessing at the exact situation of the joint. As soon as the two 
wings are removed, the knife is carried down in front of the breast- 
bone, scooping out the "merry thought" and readily separating it 
from its bony attachments. If the legs are now to be removed the 
fork is taken out of the breast, and by sticking the prongs in the leg, 
with the knife laid against the flat side, they are readily lifted out of 



CARVINO. 123 

the sockets, and torn, as it were, from the body. The neck-bones 
are now twisted off with the fork, after which the breast is removed 
whole by cutting through the ribs with the knife, and then a separa- 
ration of the backbone in the middle divides the remaining part of 
the body into the back and neck. The former of these may again 
have its side-bones easily removed with the knife, each containing a 
delicious morsel in a sort of spoon-shaped cavity, which is much 
prized by epicures. 

When a cold roast fowl is to be served at a breakfast or supper 
party, it is often the custom to carve it up completely with a sharp 
knife, and then put the joints together again, keeping them in their 
places by means of white ribbon tied in bows. This is a very good 
expedient in such a case, as it prevents the exhibition of bad carving, 
and facilitates the rapid serving of the guests, which is essential to 
success in such matters. 

Geese and ducks are carved very much on the same principle as 
the turkey and fowl, excepting that there is very little meat on the 
"merry thought," which is also more difficult to cut off. In the goose 
the best parts will be found in the breast, which is, however, not so 
meaty as that of the turkey, and the slices are much more shallow. 
Ducks are cut in slices when large, or, if small, are disjointed like 
fowls. If these are dressed with seasoning, it should not be dis- 
tributed on the plates without ascertaining that it is agreeable to the 
tastes of the party to be served. 

The grouse is usually separated at once into the breast portion, 
the back and the legs, which may readily be done without cutting, 
by inserting the fork in the former and raising it without depressing 
the latter. When this is done the knife may be carried longitudinally 
through the breast, so as to divide it into two equal portions, after 
which the back and legs may be halved in the same way. Some peo- 
ple, however, divide the grouse differently, by cutting off a leg and 
a wing together, and leaving a small breast* so as to make either 
three or five portions out of the bird. 

The guinea chicken is carved in the same way as the grouse, and 
so is the quail. 

A pheasant may be sliced on the breast like a turkey, after which, 
if the party requires it, the plan of carving for the roast fowl must 
be adopted. 

The woodcock is carved like the grouse, distributing it into four, 
or sometimes two portions only, and giving out the toast in the same 
way, equally to each plate. The thigh is usually considered the most 
delicate part of the bird. 

The snipe is only large enough to divide into a breast and back, 
with the legs. The toast is the same as for the woodcock. 



124 OBSERVATIONS ON EGGS. 

Pigeons, larks, etc,, are divided into two portions as the quail or 
snipe. 

The hare or rabbit is rather difficult to manage nicely, especially if 
it is an old one. When the carver has a strong wrist, the most ad- 
vantageous way is to carry the knife along on each side of the back 
bone, all the way from the shoulder to the tail, and leaving a useless 
piece of back in the middle about one-half an inch wide, with a good 
fleshy fillet on each side, and the legs ready for subdivision. After 
this primary division the side slices are readily served in separate 
portions by cutting them across. In default of this strong-armed 
method, some carvers cut fillets off the back and serve them, proceed- 
ing to do the same with the legs, which may or may not be previ- 
ously raised out of their sockets. A third plan consists of removing 
the legs and serving them in two portions each, then dividing 
the back into sections of about two or three inches in length, and 
finally removing the shoulders and serving them also. If this 
plan is preferred, and the hare is to be carved by a person de- 
ficient in strength of wrist, the prominent part of the backbone 
should be removed by the cook from the inside before roasting. 
A portion of the forcemeat or stuffing must of course accompany 
each plate. The back is considered the best, then the legs, and 
lastly the shoulders, which, however, some people prefer to any 
other part. 

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON EGGS. 

To PRESERVE EGGS. Put into a tub a basket of quick lime 
mixed with i pound of cream of tartar and 2 Ibs of salt, fill up 
the tub with water, stirring it till the whole seems dissolved, then 
procure fresh eggs and put them as you collect them into the 
mixture, in which they will swim, and be preserved for every pur- 
pose except the breakfast table for 10 or 12 months. 

SUBSTITUTE FOR EGGS. One ounce each of carbonate of ammo- 
nia and carbonate of soda dissolved in a pint of water and kept 
closely corked. A dessert spoonful of the fluid is sufficient for a 
pint basin of plain pudding or cake, &c. 

EGGS. The most delicious are those of the plover. 

SEA GULLS EGGS. Boiled hard and eaten with salt, pepper, vin- 
egar and mustard are considered excellent. 

EGGS A LA TRIPE. Eight eggs, 3-4 pint of good spiced gravy, 
i dessert spoonful of finely minced parsley ; boil the eggs hard, 
put them in cold water, peel them, take out the yolks whole and 
shred the whites, make 3-4 pint of bechamel sauce, add the parsley, 
and when the sauce is quite hot put the yolks of the eggs into the 



OBSERVATIONS ON EGGS. 125 

middle of the dish and the shred whites around them ; pour over 
the sauce and garnish with leaves of puff paste or fried croutons. 
There is no necessity for putting the eggs into the sauce pan with 
the bechamel sauce. The sauce being quite hot will warm the eggs 
sufficiently. Ten minutes to boil the eggs. Sufficient for 5 or 6 per- 
sons. Seasonable at all times. 

EGGS A LA MAITRE D'HOTEL. One-fourth Ib. of fresh butter, i 
tablespoonful of flour, i cup of milk, pepper and salt to taste, i ta- 
blespoonful of minced parsley, the juice of 1-2 lemon, 6 eggs. Put 
the flour and 1-2 the butter in a stew pan, stir them over the fire un- 
til the mixture thickens, pour in the milk, which should be boiling, 
add a seasoning of pepper and salt and simmer the whole for five 
minutes. Put the remainder of the butter into the sauce and add 
the minced parsley, then boil the eggs hard, strip off the shells, cut 
the eggs into quarters and put them on a dish, bring the sauce to the 
boiling point, add the lemon juice, pour over the eggs and serve ; 5 
minutes to boil the sauce, the eggs 10 to 15 minutes. Sufficient for 
4 or 5 persons ; always seasonable. 

A PRETTY DISH OF EGGS. Break some eggs into a tart dish with- 
out breaking the yolks, or laying one over the other, drop on them 
some warm water and strew lightly some crumbs of bread, put it into 
the oven till the whites are set ; serve with a wreath of parsley or 
nasturtium flowers around the dish. 

BOILED EGGS. To boil eggs lightly for children or invalids, 3 
minutes ; 3 3-4 to 4 minutes to suit the generality of tastes ; from 
6 to 7 minutes to boil them hard, and from 10 to 15 minutes 
for salads. Eggs for boiling cannot be too fresh or boiled too 
soon after they are laid. A new-laid egg requires longer to boil 
than one that is 3 or 4 days old. The eggs should be put into 
a sauce pan of boiling water very gently with a spoon, letting the 
spoon touch the bottom of the sauce pan before it is withdrawn, 
that the egg may not fall, and consequently crack. Should the eggs 
be unusually large, allow an extra 1-2 minute. Eggs for salads should 
be placed in a basin of cold water for a few minutes as soon as taken 
up, and then rolled on the table with the hand, and the shell will peel 
off nicely. 

To BOIL FRESH EGGS (Mrs. H.'s receipt,) Tepid water 4 min- 
utes will set the whites, 5 minutes will set the yolks, 10 minutes will 
boil them hard. When put in boiling water the whites harden too 
fast for the yolk ; tepid water is the best ; or place the eggs in cold 
water ; when the water begins to bubble the whites will be well set. 

HARD BOILED EGGS WITH ONIONS. Pick 3 good sized sound 
(white) onions (the best); cut them in two, then lay each 1-2 on the 
board and cut in slices 1-8 inch thick; blanch in boiling water for 



126 OMELETS. 

5 minutes and drain the onion on a cloth ; put i 1-2 ounce of butter 
in a 2 quart stew pan, put the onion in, stir over the fire till they are 
brown, add i ounce of flour, 1-2 pint of broth, i pinch of salt, i 
small pinch of pepper ; stir ever a slow fire for 20 minutes, take 

6 hard boiled eggs, cut them in thin shoes, mix them with the 
onion ; taste for seasoning. Garnish with nasturtium leaves, flowers 
and buds. 

HARD BOILED EGGS WITH SORREL. Put 6 eggs in boiling water 
and boil for 10 minutes. This time should not be exceeded, oth- 
erwise the yolks would become of a bad color. Put the eggs in 
cold water, take them up and roll them on the table when cold, 
or remove the shell with the hand, wash them clean and cut each 
in two lengthwise; put i 1-2 pint of sorrel prepared for garnish 
on a dish, lay the pieces of eggs on it and serve. 

-EGGS. After boiling, to prevent them cooking more after taking 
them up, break the small end. 

OMELETS. 

BEEF OMELETS. (Mrs. Adams.) Four pounds of round beef 
uncooked chopped fine, 6 eggs beaten together, 5 or 6 soda crack- 
ers rolled fine, a little butter, suet, pepper, salt and sage ; make 2 
loaves, roll in cracker, bake i hour, slice cold. 

OMELET, VEAL (Mrs. F. B. B.) Three Ibs. raw veal chopped 
fine, 3 eggs well beaten, 3 spoonfuls of salt, i of pepper, 6 or 7 
crackers grated fine ; mix well together, make into a loaf put in a 
stew pan, bake with butter and water and a spoonful of cream. 

KIDNEY OMELET (A favorite French dish.) Six eggs, i teaspoon- 
ful of salt, i pinch of pepper, 2 sheep's kidneys or 2 tablespoonfuls 
of minced veal kidney, 5 ounces of butter. Skin the kidneys, cut 
them into small dice and toss them into a frying pan in i ounce of 
butter over the fire for 2 or 3 minutes; mix the ingredients for the 
omelet as for plain omelet, and when the eggs are well whisked stir 
in the pieces of kidney. Make the butter hot in the frying pan, and 
when it bubbles pour in the omelet and fry it over a gentle fire from 
4 to 6 minutes ; when the eggs are set fold the edges over, so that 
the omelet assumes an oval form, and be careful that it is not too 
much done ; to brown the top hold the pan before the fire for a min- 
ute or two, or use a salamander until the desired color is obtained ; 
but never turn the omelet in the pan ; slip it carefully on to a dish 
very hot, or what is a much safer method, put a dish on the omelet 
and turn the pan quickly over. It should be served the instant it 
comes from the fire; 4 to 5 minutes. Seasonable at any time. 

OMELETS WITH CHEESE. For cheese omelets put into your eggs 
a tablespoonfuls of grated California cheese and proceed as above. 



OMELETS. 

MRS. F.'s OMELETS. Beat the yolks of 3 eggs, i cup of milk, i 
cup of flour, i teaspoonful of yeast powder ; Beat the whites of the 
3 eggs to a froth. 

To MAKE A FISH OMELET. There are two ways of making these, 
one is merely to flake some ready cooked fish ; salt cod is very suit- 
able; season with cayenne pepper, nutmeg and white pepper; mix 
it with 6 beaten eggs and one dessert spoonful of cream or milk, fry 
it on one side only, fold it and serve. Salt shad makes a nice ome- 
let. 

OMELET WITH SHRIMPS. Fry an omelet, put the shrimps (which 
have been cooked and buttered) in it before folding it, turn the ome- 
let in a dish, pour some sauce around it and serve. 

EGG AND OYSTER OMELET. Beat up 4 eggs and season to taste, 
chop up 6 large oysters, make a batter of a half cupful of flour and 
a cup of milk. Mix and stir the whole well together and fry very 
slowly. 

OYSTER OMELET. Chop i 1-2 dozen oysters very fine and mix 
them with 8 well beaten eggs and 3 spoonfuls of flour thoroughly. 
Fry them as directed for tomato omelet. 

FRIED EGGS. Four eggs, 1-4 Ib. of lard, butter or clarified 
drippings. Place a delicately clean frying pan over a gentle fire, 
put in the fat and allow it to come to the boiling point, break 
the eggs into cups and slip them into the boiling fat and let them 
remain until the whites are delicately set ; and whilst they are fry- 
ing ladle a little of the fat over them. Take them up with a knife, 
drain them for a minute from their greasy moisture, trim them 
neatly and serve on slices of nice ham or bacon, or the eggs may 
be placed in the middle of the dish with bacon put around as a 
garnish. Sufficient for 2 persons. Cook 2 to 3 minutes ; seasona- 
ble always. 

FRIED EGGS WITH TOMATO SAUCE. Put 3 tablespoonfuls of oil in 
a saute pan, tilt it up on the corner of the stove to collect all the oil 
in one place, and hold the pan over a sharp fire ; when the oil is 
hot break one egg in it ; season with a little salt and pepper with 2 
onions, gather the white of the egg over the yolk so as to form a 
ball, turn it over and drain it immediately ; fry separately in the same 
way as many eggs as may be required ; the yolks should not be set. 
Sprinkle with pepper and salt, put on a dish and serve with 2 gills of 
tomato sauce, and garnish with the green leaves and the flowers of 
nasturtium. 

EGGS ON THE DISH. Spread i ounce of butter on a round trim- 
med iron dish, sprinkle with 1-2 pinch of salt and a small pinch of 
pepper; break 6 new laid eggs in a dish, sprinkle over another half 
pinch of salt and 2 small pinches of pepper ; put on the stove with 



I2 8 OMELETS. 

live coals on the glazing cover; cook for 4 minutes; when the 
whites are set the eggs are done ; serve in the dish in which they 
have been cooked. 

ROASTED EGGS. Covered in hot ashes for 1-2 hour are excel- 
lent ; they should be wrapped in paper and dipped in water, and 
then covered with hot ashes, or the small end may simply be 
cracked or wet in cold water, then put over them a layer of cold 
ashes, and then covered with hot ashes ; eaten with pepper, salt and 
butter, or with salt only. 

THE CURE'S OMELET. For 6 persons. Take the roes of any 2 
fish, bleach them by putting them 5 minutes in boiling water 
slightly salted ; take a piece of mackerel or sea bass about the 
size of a hen's egg, to which add a shallot already chopped, hack 
up together the roe and the mackerel or bass, so as to mix them 
well, and throw the whole into a sauce pan with a sufficient quantity 
of very good fresh butter ; whip it until the butter is melted. This 
constitutes the specialty of the omelet. Take a second piece of 
butter, as much as you like, mix it with parsley and herbs, place it in 
a long shaped dish destined to receive the omelet, squeeze the juice 
of a lemon over it and place it on hot embers; beat up 12 eggs (the 
fresher the better), throw up the saute of roe and mackerel, stirring 
it so as to mix all well together, then make your omelet in the usual 
manner, endeavoring to turn it out long, thick and soft. Spread it 
carefully on the dish prepared for it and serve at once. This dish 
should be reserved for assemblies when connoisseurs meet, who know 
how to eat well. 

The roe and mackerel must be beaten up (saute) without allow- 
ing them to boil, to prevent their hardening, which would prevent 
their mixing well with the eggs. Your dish must be hollowed 
toward the center to allow the gravy to concentrate, that it may 
be helped with a spoon. The dish ought to be slightly heated, 
otherwise it would extract the heat from the omelet. As soon as 
the spoon enters the omelet a thick, rich juice ought to flow, pleas- 
ant to the eye as well as grateful to the smell. 

OMELET AU RHEIMS (French.) Beat well 4 eggs, add 2 ounces 
sifted sugar, 2 ozs. currants washed and dried in a cloth and plumped 
in brandy. Fry in a pan with boiling lard, serve with a glass of 
rum poured over it ; send it burning hot to the table. 

FRENCH PROMISES OR OMELET. Mix together 1-2 pint of milk, 2 
teaspoonfuls of French brandy, i egg and a little grated ginger ; 
mix it with flour to a proper thickness for pancakes and drop into a 
frying pan with the lard very hot. 

OMELET WITH HERBS. Six eggs will make a nice omelet for 2 
rsons for supper ; a teaspoonful of salt, a salt spoonful of pep- 
per; break them carefully in a basin, (one tainted egg will spoil all 



OMELETS. 129 

the rest;) add 3-4 of a tablespoonful of salt and a salt spoonful of 
pepper, 2 teaspoonfuls of chopped parsley, 1-2 a one of fine chop- 
ped onions ; beat them well, add i large spoonful of butter in a nice 
clean and dry frying pan, place it then on the fire, and when the but- 
ter is hot pour in your eggs, which keep mixing quick with a spoon 
until all is delicately set, then let it slip to the edge of the pan en 
mass ; lay hold of the handle, raising it slantwise, which will give an 
elongated form to the omelet ; turning the edges let it set a minute, 
turn on a dish and serve. 

OMELETS WITH MUSHROOMS. Add a couple of middling sized 
mushrooms cut very thin and proceed as for herb omelet. 

OMELET WITH ASPARAGUS PEAS. Make an omelet with 8 eggs 
very slightly salted, garnish it before folding with asparagus peas 
mixed with German sauce. When colored turn the omelet on a 
dish, poursorne German sauce around it and serve. 

GREEN CORN OMELET. Grate 6 or 7 ears of boiled green corn, 
stir in with it 3 well beaten eggs, some butter, pepper and salt; fry 
in a well buttered skillet as other omelets. When done set in a stove 
to brown a little. 

OMELET WITH PEPPER GRASS OR NASTURTIUM. Cut the pepper 
grass 1-2 inch in length, plain boil them in salt and water till done, 
add 2 spoonfuls of your egg, and proceed as for herb omelet. The 
water cress can be used instead of the pepper grass. 

TOMATO OMELET. Beat up 6 eggs and mix them with six large 
tomatoes peeled and chopped very fine and 3 tablespoonfuls of flour. 
Stir well together and fry on a well cleaned griddle. 

SAN FRANCISCO OMELET. Take a dozen large sound apples and 
boil them as for sauce, stir to this pulp 4 ounces each of butter and 
sugar to taste ; when cold add 4 well beaten eggs, then butter well a 
deep baking dish, both sides and bottom, thickly strew crumbs of 
bread so as to stick all over the bottom, put in the apples and egg 
mixture and strew crumbs plentifully over the top ; when baked pour 
it into another dish and grate sugar over it. 

To MAKE A PLAIN SWEET OMELET. Six eggs, 4 ounces of but- 
ter, i ounce of sifted sugar; break the eggs into a basin, omitting 
the whites of 3, whisk them well, adding the sugar and 4 ounces of 
the butter, which should be broken into small pieces and stir all 
these ingredients well together. Make the remainder of the butter 
quite hot in a small frying pan, and when it commences to bubble 
pour in the eggs, &c. Keep stirring them until they begin to 
set, then turn the edges of the omelet over to make it an oval 
shape and finish cooking it. To brown the top hold the pan be- 
fore the fire or on a salver under, and turn it very carefully on 
to a very hot dish ; sprinkle sifted sugar over and serve ; cook 
from 4 to 5 minutes. Always seasonable. 



OMELETS. 

A MATCHLESS OMELET. Break 10 eggs in a basin, beat up 
with them i spoonful of powdered white sugar and a small pinch 
of salt; butter a small pancake pan, pour in 2 tablespoonfuls of 
the egg, letting it spread in the pan like a pancake; fry it for a 
few minutes and fold one side to the center, put a little apricot 
jam on the centre, fold the 2 ends to the middle over the jam, 
and roll the omelet round. Make 6 of these small omelets, put 
them on a dish, sprinkle over some fine sugar, glaze them with 
a hot salamander and serve. This omelet is nothing more than egg 
pancakes, and should always be made very light and thin. 

OUR FAVORITE OMELET. Scald a pint of milk, into which stir the 
yolks of 5 eggs, a tablespoonful each of sugar and flour, and lastly 
the whites of the eggs well beaten. Bake in a quick oven. 

To MAKE A PLAIN OMELET. Six eggs, i pinch of salt, 1-4 Ib. of 
butter; pepper. Break the eggs in a basin, omitting the whites of 
3 and beat them all up with the salt and pepper until extremely 
light, then add 2 ounces of butter broken into small pieces, and stir 
this into the mixture. Put the 2 ounces of butter into a frying pan, 
make it quite hot, and as soon as it begins to bubble, whisk the eggs, 
&c.. very briskly for a minute or two and pour them into the pan ; 
stir the omelet with a spoon one way until the mixture thickens and 
becomes firm, and when the whole is set fold the edges over so that 
the omelet assumes an oval form, and when it is nicely brown on one 
side and quite firm it is done. To take off the roughness on the up- 
per side hold the pan before the fire for a minute or two and brown 
it with a salamander or hot shovel. Serve very expeditiously on a 
very hot dish, and never cook it until it is just wanted. The flavor 
of this omelet may be very much enhanced by adding minced pars- 
ley, minced onion or shallot, or grated cheese, allowing i tablespoon- 
ful of the former and 1-2 the quantity of the latter to the above pro- 
portion of eggs. Shrimps or oysters may also be added ; the latter 
should be scalded in their liquor and then bearded and cut into 
small pieces. In making an omelet be particularly careful that 
it is not too thin, and to avoid this do not make it in too large a fry- 
ing pan, as the mixture would then spread too much and taste of the 
outside. It should also not be greasy, burnt or too much done, and 
should be cooked over a gentle fire, and the whole of the substance 
may be heated without drying up the outsides. Omelets are some- 
times served with gravy, but this should never be poured over them, 
but served in a tureen, as the liquid causes the omelet to become 
icavy and flat instead of eating light and soft. In making the gravy 
flavor should not overpower that of the omelet, and should be 
:ened with arrow root or rice flour. Cook with 6 eggs in a fry- 
ing pan 1 8 to 20 inches round 2 to 6 minutes. Seasonable always. 



SANDWICHES 



SANDWICHES. 

CHEESE SANDWICHES, Slices brown bread and butter, and thin 
slices of cheese. Cut from any good, rich cheese, some slices about 
1-2 an inch thick and place them between some slices of brown 
bread and butter, like sandwiches, place them on a plate in the 
oven, and when the bread is toasted serve on a napkin very hot, 
quickly. Ten minutes in a brisk oven. One sandwich to each 
person. Always seasonable. 

SANDWICH CREAM CHEESE. Put a small quantity of very fresh 
cream cheese in a basin or marble mortar, season with some pep- 
per and salt, a little powdered mustard and beat well together till 
of thickness of batter. If too hard add a little butter and use it as 
butter on the bread with slices of meat between, 

CHICKEN SANDWICHES. Cut some slices of bread and butter, as 
described in ham sandwiches. Sprinkle over some salt and garnish 
the sandwiches with fillets of cold roast chicken, cut very thin, press 
and cut the sandwiches as ham sandwiches. Dish them on a nap- 
kin. 

SUMMER SANDWICHES. Make the sandwiches in the ordinary way 
by buttering both sides of the slices of bread and putting thin slices 
of tongue, roast mutton, or beef, or boiled ham, poultry, or game, 
with a slight seasoning of pepper, mustard, salt, and some add 
shreded lettuce, cress, or any of the salad vegetables, over the meat. 
Herring is also very nice to use ; when cooked, then press the sand- 
wiches and cut and serve them as cheese sandwiches. Lobsters and 
other fish are nice, and also oysters are delicious. 

SANDWICH DRESSING. Chop fine and mix thoroughly tongue, 
ham, veal, mutton or beef, tender and well cooked, the white 
meat from a roasted or boiled fowl or game, some nasturtium 
pods or flowers, all in equal portions, and also hard-boiled eggs 
chopped to mince, some piquant vegetable or sauce, a little cream 
and butter, and some mustard beaten fine. Mix all thoroughly, 
then spread evenly on buttered slices of bread and form the 
sandwiches. Fish or any of' the Crustacea may be used. 

VINEGAR SANDWICHES (Mrs. Scott). Grate or chop very fine, 
old ham, beat an egg thoroughly and mix with some ground 
mustard ; let boil i cup of wine vinegar, stir in the egg and mus- 
tard and mix with the ham. After buttering well some bread, 
spread on this the prepared mixture. 

SANDWICH SALAD. Cover the bread as before, and have ready 
some mustard, cress and water-cresses well washed and dried, 
put into a bowl with mayonnaise sauce. When ready place it 
neatly between the bread. 



1^2 SANDWICHES. 

HERRING TOAST SANDWICH. Choose a North Carolina herring 
for this purpose, but not too dry, which should be divided by 
cutting down the back; lay them upon a dish and pour boiling 
water over them. Let them remain for five minutes, then lay 
them on a cloth to dry; then broil them slowly for four or five 
minutes on a gridiron until done ; then have ready some crisp toast 
in thin slices, butter them slightly, take out the bones of the 
fish, lay the fleshy parts equally upon one piece of toast and 
cover over with the other; then put one upon the other sand- 
wich. Serve very hot. Dried haddock and sardines laid over cold 
may be served in the same way. 

SANDWICH PASTRY. Roll out two pieces of paste very thin and 
of equal size. Spread any kind of jam over one of them and cover 
with the other. Bake it, cut it in slices or rounds and glaze it with 
French mustard. 

HAM SANDWICHES. Remove all the crust from a loaf of bread 
baked in a tin, butter and cut up the bread into slices 1-8 of an inch 
thick, cover one slice of bread very evenly with thin slices of boiled 
ham laid on the buttered side ; spread a little mustard on the top ; 
proceed in the same way until all the bread is used ; press the slices 
tightly together and cut them through into pieces 2 1-2 inches by 
i 1-2. Dish the sandwiches on a napkin and serve. 

VEAL AND HAM SANDWICHES. Simmer veal and ham knuckle a 
long time in very little water until perfectly tender, then take out the 
bones and gristles and chop the meat together to a pulp, then spread 
it over bread as you would butter, and add mixed mustard over it, 
then butter another slice of bread rather lightly and put over the 
other slice of bread, as for common sandwiches. 

BEEF AH MODE. Take the tenderest part of a round of beef 
and lard it with bacon, season with onions and parsley cut fine, a 
little salt, pepper and nutmeg. Put it on the fire with slices of fat and 
lean bacon at the bottom of the pan and cover it with the same ; 
put in chopped carrots and a glass of white wine, and let it boil 
gently for 3 hours, taking care that it does not stick to the pan. 
Strain the gravy. Skim off the grease and serve up very hot. Con- 
tributed by Mrs. Mary Upshur Sturgis; New York City. 

BEEF LOAF. 3 1-2 Ibs. of round of steak chopped very fine, i 
cup of crumbled or powdered crackers, 2 well beaten eggs, i cup 
>! new milk, i tablespoonful salt, i teaspoonful pepper and i spoon- 
lul butter. Mix well, then put into a deep pudding dish in the form 
of a loaf. Bake 31-2 hours. 

PRESSED C HIC KEN.-Boil a chicken until tender; chop fine, seas- 
11 with pepper, salt and butter, put into a cloth or flat bottomed 

eep dish or bowl, and put a heavy weight on it. It is delicious to 
cat cola for lunch or tea. 



FOWLS. 133 

A SIMPLE WAY TO BAKE HAM. Wash your ham over night with 
homemade soap, rubbing it with a cloth, then scrape it well and rinse 
it well in several waters with a clean rag, wipe it dry and put it into 
clean water and let it remain untill next morning, then wipe it per- 
fectly dry. Make a dough of flour and water, roll out 1-2 an inch 
thick, then wrap your ham closely in it, so the juice cannot escape 
and bake until done, then take off the crust and serve either cold or 
hot for lunch or tea. Cut in thin slices. The skin may be taken off 
or not, as one fancies. 

A DRY DEVIL. Take the liver, gizzard and drumsticks of a turkey, 
and score them ; lay on made mustard very thickly, and add a quan- 
tity of cayenne pepper and broil them. 

FOWLS. 

REMEMBER that practice makes perfect, and that "little by little " 
we accomplish great things. 

How TO PREPARE FOWLS FOR COOKING. Turkey, for instance: 
Pick your turkey well, pick out all the pin-feathers, singe it over a 
clear blaze, pull out all the shreds of fat, bloody bits, lungs, ^..leav- 
ing the inside perfectly clean. Be careful and not break the gall in 
taking out the liver it almost spoils your stuffing, as no amount of 
washing can remove it from the inside of the turkey. Boil the heart, 
gizzard and liver until tender, chop very fine and add to the stuf- 
fing, which should be made of stale bread, if you have it, if not, 
crackers pounded fine. Season with salt, pepper, sage and butter 
to your taste. Mix with boiling water, being very careful not to put 
too much, as the beauty of the stuffing is to be dry. When light 
add i or 2 beaten eggs. Now the turkey being made ready one day 
before, is stuffed, rub it all over thoroughly with salt under the wings 
and thighs, that it may be well seasoned when cooked, as many are ex- 
ceedingly fond of the brown, crisp skin which is much nicer to be salted 
before cooking. Bind the wings down with wrapping cord, tie the 
legs together and tie them to the body of the bird. It is a good plan 
to cut all the trussing strings 1-2 hour before taking the turkey from 
the oven, that the heat may reach under the wings and thighs ; lay 
the turkey upon a cricket in the dripping pan, never upon the pan, 
as the oily water soaks in and injures the flavor. If no cricket comes 
with your dripping pan you can have one made of hard wood strips 
1-2 inch square, two i foot long and four 8 inches long for cross 
pieces nailed together an inch from end to end, to be used in cook- 
ing or roasting all kinds of meats ; must be thoroughly and care- 
fully washed every time and dried, or you can have a tin cricket made. 

Put no water into the dripping pan until the turkey has cooked 



134 FOWLS. 

long enough to allow the fat to drip down and brown at the bottom 
of the pan. By this means you obtain the much prized gravy with 
less trouble than the usual way of toasting flour for the thickening. 
After you have put water into the pan baste the fowl frequently by 
dipping it over it. Dust flour over the turkey and lay on all the fat 
that has been taken from the inside. It melts and runs down, and 
thus keeps the skin from drying too much. Put a turkey weighing 
10 or 12 Ibs. into the oven at 8 o'clock in the morning if you dine at 
12. It should be baked for 4 hours. In winter the stuffing should 
be prepared the day before, as the mornings are short ; when you 
remove the turkey to the platter or dish remember to take out the 
shreds used to sew up the bird before roasting, as it may inconven- 
ience the carver^by getting his knife entangled in it. After the gravy 
is thickened and cooked pour it into a bowl or tureen and let the fat 
rise, and remove every spoonful of it. Then if you choose you can 
put it back into the dripping pan and add, after removing the fat, a 
portion of butter, and then pour it into the gravy tureen for the 
table. 

To BOIL CHICKENS. After you have drawn them, lay them in 
skimmed milk for 2 hours and truss them. When you have prop- 
erly singed and dusted them with flour cover them closely in cold 
water and set them over a slow fire. Having taken off the scum 
and boiled them slowly 5 or 6 minutes, take them off the fire and 
keep them closely covered for 1-2 hour in the water, which will do 
them sufficiently and make them plump and white. Before you dish 
them set them on the fire to heat ; then drain them and pour over 
them white sauce, which you have just made ready in the following 
manner: Take the heads of th^ chickens with a small piece of scrag 
veal, or any scraps of mutton you may have by you, and put them 
in a sauce-pan with a blade or two of mace, a few black pepper- 
corns, a head of celery, a slice of the end of a lemon and a bunch 
of parsley and thyme. Put to these a quart of water, cover it closely 
and let it boil until it is reduced to 1-2 pint ; then strain and thicken 
it with a cup of butter mixed with flour and boil 5 or 6 minutes; 
then put in 2 spoonfuls of mushroom, walnut or tomato catsup and 
mix the yolks of 2 eggs with a teacupful of cream and a little nut- 
meg grated. Put in your sauce and keep shaking over the fire till 
it is near boiling ; then pour it into your boat and serve it up with 
your chicken. 

BOILED FOWL with oysters is excellent. One young fowl, 3 dozen 
oysters, the yolks of 2 eggs, and 1-4 pint of cream. Truss a young 
fowl as for boiling, fill the inside with oysters which have been bearded 
and washed in their own liquor ; secure the ends of the fowl, put it 
into a jar and plunge the jar into a sauce-pan of boiling water. 



FOWLS. 135 

Keep it boiling i 1-2 hours, or rather longer; then take the gravy 
that has flowed from the oysters and fowl, of which there will be a 
good quantity, stir in the cream and yolks of eggs ; add a few oys- 
ters scalded in their liquor; let the sauce get quite hot, but do not 
allow it to boil ; pour some of it over the fowl and the remainder 
send to the table in a tureen. A blade of pounded mace added to 
the sauce with the cream and eggs will be found an improvement. 

FOWLS BOILED WITH RICE. Stew the fowl very slowly in some 
clean mutton broth well skimmed, and season with onion, mace, 
pepper and salt. About 1-2 hour before it is ready, put in 1-4 Ib. 
of rice well washed and soaked ; simmer until done, then strain it 
from the broth, and put the rice in a sieve before the fire. Keep 
the fowl hot, lay il in the middle of the dish, and the rice around it, 
without the broth. The broth will be very nice to eat as such, but 
the less liquor the fowl is done with, the better. Gravy, or parsley 
and butter for sauce. 

To BROIL FOWLS. Pick and truss your fowl the same as for boil- 
ing; cut it open on the back, wipe the inside clean with a cloth, 
season with pepper and salt; have a clear fire and set on the grid- 
iron at a good distance from it ; lay the chicken on with the inside 
toward the fire (you may egg it and strew some grated bread over it) 
and broil it till it is of a fine brown color ; take care the fleshly side 
is not burned. Lay it on a hot dish, pickled mushrooms or mush- 
room sauce to be thrown over it, or parsley and butter, or melted 
butter flavored with mushroom catsup. Garnish with slices of lemon 
and the liver and gizzard slit and notched, seasoned with pepper and 
salt and broiled nicely brown, and some slices of lemon. 

To BROIL CHICKENS WHOLE. Split your chickens down the back, 
or underside through the breast-bone, season them with pepper and 
salt, and lay them on the gridiron over a clear fire and at a great 
distance. Let the inside continue next to the fire until they are 
nearly half-done; then turn them, taking care that the fleshy sides 
do not burn, and let them broil until they are of a fine brown. Have 
ready good gravy sauce with some mushrooms, and garnish them 
with lemon and the livers broiled, the gizzards cut, slashed and 
broiled, with pepper and salt. 

SMALL CHICKENS may be broiled in the same way as well as ducks 
and young turkeys. 

BROILED CHICKENS Split your chickens down the back or stom- 
ach. If you wish them for breakfast, let them remain over night in 
salt and water. Then put them in a boiler or gridiron over bright 
coals, free from smoke ; put a cover over them to make them cook 
faster. Baste frequently with pepper, salt, butter and a little vinegar 
(if liked). In the meantime boil your giblets in water, chop and. 



136 FOWLS. 

make them fine. Make a gravy of some of the water in which they 
were boiled, some butter and minced parsley, and pour it over the 
chicken, and serve in a hot dish. 

To FRY CHICKENS. Cut your chickens into quarters or every 
limb separate, and rub them with flour, the yolk of an egg or dip 
them in a thin batter, then strew on them some crumbs of stale 
bread, with pepper and salt and chopped parsley. Fry them in sweet 
bacon grease, butter or lard. Bacon grease is the best, and when 
done, put them into your dish on a hot stove ; then pour some cream 
into the pan, or fresh sweet milk, a small portion thickened with a 
teaspoonful of flour, and poured in and stirred and poured over the 
chicken, and serve hot. Or, if preferred, grated nutmeg, lemon 
peel, a small quantity of cayenne pepper, some mushroom pow- 
der, or catsup, and a little lemon juice may be added to the 
gravy. 

FRIED CHICKENS (Mrs. E. A. B. Upshur, Virginia). When the 
chickens are cleaned and cut up, dip the pieces in beaten yolks of 
eggs, then roll them in bread crumbs and sprinkle with black pep- 
per and salt. While they are frying, make a gravy of rich cream 
seasoned with a little nutmeg and chopped parsley stewed together. 
Pour the gravy into the dish and lay the chicken on it. 

FRIED CHICKEN WITH LEMON PEEL. The remains of roasted 
fowl, vinegar, salt and cayenne pepper to taste, 4 minced shallots, 
yolk of egg ; to every teaspoonful of bread crumbs allow i blade of 
pounded mace, 1-2 teaspoonful of minced lemon peel, 2 pinches of 
salt, and a few grains of cayenne pepper. Steep the pieces of fowl 
as in the preceding recipe ; then dip them in the yolk of egg or clar- 
ified butter, sprinkle over bread crumbs, with which have mixed 
salt, mace, cayenne pepper-antf lemon p. el in the above proportions. 
Fry of a light brown and serve with or without gravy, as may be pre- 
ferred. Ten minutes to fry the fowl. 

To FRY CHICKEN (Georgia Cook). After cutting up the chick- 
ens, salt and pepper, flour and fry them in boiling lard or oil; when 
the whole are fried, drain off the lard and add a good spoonful of 
sweet butter, a little flour stirred into a teacupful of sweet cream, 
and some scalded parsley minced fine for the gravy. 

FRIED CHICKEN. Take nice, fat, young chickens about half-grown, 
cut into nice pieces and salt and pepper to taste. Roll or dredge 
thickly with flour or corn meal, and stir in boiling lard. They will 
be more tender by covering while cooking (even a rather hot lid 
with some hot embers on it), When a nice brown, take it up, and 
to make a nice gravy add 2 heaping teaspoonfuls of flour to the lard, 
in which the chicken has been fried. Stir well and add water or 
sweet milk to make of the proper consistency, stirring all the while. 
Season to taste. 



FOWLS. 137 

CHICKENS FRIED IN BATTER. Prepare your chickens as for fry- 
ing, then make a batter of 2 eggs well beaten, i teacup of milk, 
some salt, and sufficient flour to make thin batter. Then dip each 
piece of chicken into the batter and fry in hot lard or the essence of 
sweet fat bacon. 

FRIED FOWLS. The remains of cold roast fowls, vinegar, salt and 
cayenne pepper to taste, and 3 or 4 minced shallots. For the bat- 
ter, 1-2 Ib. of flour, 1-2 pint of hot water, 2 oz. of butter, and the 
whites of 2 eggs. Cut the fowls into nice joints, steep them for an 
hour in a little vinegar, with salt, cayenne pepper and minced shal- 
lots. Make the batter by mixing the flour and water smoothly together ; 
melt it in the batter, and add the whites of eggs beaten to a froth, 
and fry in boiling lard a nice brown. Pile them high in the dish and 
garnish with fried parsley or rolled bacon. When approved a sauce 
or gravy may be served with them. Ten minutes to fry the fowl. 
Seasonable at any time. 

FRIED CHICKEN GRANGER METHOD. Two young chickens cut 
up at the joints, 3 eggs beaten light, i cup of bread or cracker 
crumbs, sweet lard, dripping or olive oil (commonly known as sweet 
or salad oil). After preparing the chickens, let them remain 1-4 
of an hour in salt and water, wipe the pieces dry, pepper and 
salt them, dip them into the well beaten eggs, then into meal, 
flour or bread crumbs, and fry slowly in hot lard, dripping or 
olive oil. Pile on a hot dish and lay over sprigs or parsley. 

CHICKEN CUTLETS. Two chickens seasoned to taste with salt, 
white and cayenne pepper, 2 blades of pounded mace, egg and 
bread crumbs, clarified butter, i strip of lemon rind, 2 carrots, i 
onion, 2 tablespoonfuls of mushroom catsup, thickening of butter, 
fk ur and i egg. Remove the breasfrand leg bones of the chickens, 
cut the meat into neat pieces after having skinned it, and season 
the cutlets with pepper, salt, pounded mace and cayenne. Put 
the bones, trimmings, etc., into a stewpan with i pint of water, 
adding carrots, onions and lemon peel in the above proportion. 
Stew gently for i 1-2 hour and strain the gravy. Thicken it with 
butter and flour, add the catsup and i egg well beaten ; stir it 
over the fire and bring it to the simmering point, but do not let 
it boil. In the meantime egg and crumb the cutlets, and give 
them a few dips of clarified butter ; fry them a delicate brown, 
occasionally turning them. Arrange them pyramidically on the dish 
and pour over them the sauce. Ten minutes to fry cutlets. 

THE DUCK. This bird belongs to the order called swimmers or 
natatores. It lives mostly (when it can) in water, feeding on fish, 
worms and aquatic plants, and makes its nest in a moist place. Its 
flesh is savory, not being as gross as that of the goose and easier of 



138 FOWLS. 

digestion, though the flesh of many is not eatable, being extremely 
rank and oily. It requires a mixture of vegetable and animal food, 
for it is by no means a nice feeder, and is excessively greedy. Its 
proper food is corn, aquatic insects and vegetables. There are nearly 
a hundred different species of ducks, so naturalists say. Light-col- 
ored ducks are always of a milder flavor than the dark-colored ones, 
and consequently are more valuable for table use. The flesh of 
ducks and all fowls fed on animal food will be firmer than that fed 
on vegetable food, but when fed on the latter it is much whiter and 
more delicious. Ducks are generally served with apple sauce. 

To STEW A DUCK WITH GREEN PEAS. Parboil a duck, then 
put it into a stewpan with a pint of gravy, some mint and 3 or 
4 leaves of sage cut small. Cover the pan and stew for 1-2 an 
hour. Thicken the gravy and put in 1-2 pint of green peas 
ready boiled ; dish up the duck and peas together. Garnish with 
boiled mint chopped very fine. 

STEWED DCCKS. Half-roast a duck; put it into a stewpan with 
a pint of gravy, a few leaves of sage and mint cut small, pepper, 
salt and a small bit of onion chopped as fine as possible. Sim- 
mer 1-4 of an hour and skim clean, then add nearly a quart of 
green peas. Cover closely and simmer nearly 1-2 an hour. Put 
in a piece of butter and a little flour, and give it one boil ; then 
serve it in one dish. 

BRUNSWICK STEW. Put into your soup kettle a nice, fat, young 
chicken or more, or a hen or two half-grown chickens, then pour 
in water enough to cover it, salt to taste, and let it stew until 
tender. If a hen, it should cook longer than young chickens ; 
cut i gallon of thoroughly riye tomatoes and season them with 
butter, an onion, i teacup of sugar, 2 or 3 slices of bacon, pep- 
per and salt, as you would to stew, put them in the kettle with 
the chicken, and i hour before you serve it, cut the grains off 
12 large ears of corn and add to it. The chicken should be 
cooked so tender that it will fall to pieces, and when taking it 
up remove the bones. Young ducks, guinea chickens, squabs, 
or young rabbits make a fine substitute for young chickens. 
Young turkeys will do. 

BRUNSWICK STEW. Two squirrels or small chickens, i quart of 
peeled and sliced tomatoes, 6 parboiled potatoes sliced, 6 or 7 
ears of green corn cut from the cob, i cup of butter, 8 oz. fat pork, 
a pepper-box top full of ground black pepper, a large pinch of cay- 
enne pepper, 4 quarts of water, i tablespoonful salt, 2 teaspoonfuls 
white sugar, and i onion minced small. Let the water boil, then 
put in the vegetables, the pork or bacon cut into shreds, potatoes, 
and pepper. The squirrels or chicken must be cut into joints and. 



FOWLS. 139 

laid in cold salt and water to draw out the blood Cover closely and 
stew slowly 2 1-2 hours, frequently stirring from the bottom. Then 
add the tomatoes and the sugar, and stew another 1-2 hour longer. 
Ten minutes before you take it up from the fire add the butter, give 
it a final boil, taste to see that it is seasoned to your liking and turn 
it into a deep dish or tureen. It should be eaten from soup plates. 
This stew is named from Brunswick county, Virginia, where the 
large gray squirrel is abundant, as in all parts of that State. 

NOTE. Chickens or fowls are improved in flavor if, before cook- 
ing, they be rubbed inside and outside with lemon juice or a weak 
solution of pure fruit vinegar and water. This will also improve the 
flavor of pork, though the lemon juice is used after being served on 
the table. 

ROASTED DUCK. A particularly tender duck should be procured 
for roasting. Stuff the duck with stuffing prepared as follows: Take 
4 onions cut in slices, with 24 sage leaves, blanch both for 5 min- 
utes, drain and chop fine ; put in a stewpan with i spoonful of but- 
ter, 2 pinches of salt and 2 small pinches of pepper ; simmer gently 
for 10 minutes, stirring with a wooden spoon; add a handful of 
bread crumbs and stir for 2 minutes more ; the stuffing is then ready 
for use ; truss the duck and put it to roast before a brisk fire for 16 
minutes. Roasted duck should be sent to the table rather under- 
done. Remove the string, pour the gravy under the duck and serve. 
If not stuffed, a garnish of water-cresses is sometimes served around 
roasted ducks. 

To BOIL DUCKS. Choose a fine, fat duck, salt it 2 days, and then 
boil it in a cloth. Serve with onion sauce, but melt the butter with 
milk instead of water. 

BOILED GOOSE (Mrs. D. H. H.). Dress and singe your goose, 
put it into a deep dish, cover with boiling milk and leave over night. 
'Next morning wash off the milk and put the fowl into cold water on 
the fire ; when boiling hot, take it off and wash it in warm water and 
dry with a cloth. This process takes out the oil. Fill the body with 
a dressing of bread crumbs seasoned with pepper, salt, butter and 
' chopped onions, if relished, and a little sage. Put the goose into 
cold water and boil gently until tender. Serve with a sauce made 
of giblets, liver, with pickles or sour jellies. 

To DRESS A GREEN GOOSE. A goose, 3 oz. butter, pepper and 
salt to taste. Geese are called green until they are about 4 months 
old, and should be stuffed. After it has been singed and trussed as 
roasted goose, put into the body a seasoning of pepper and salt and 
the butter to moisten it inside. Roast in a stove or before a clear 
fire for 3-4 of an hour, froth and brown it nicely, and serve with 
brown gravy) and when liked, gooseberry sauce. This dish should 



T4O FOWLS. 

be garnished -with water-cresses, or nasturtium flowers, leaves and 
buds. This will do for 5 or 6 persons. 

A GOOD STUFFING FOR DUCK OR GOOSE. Take 4 apples peeled 
and cored, 4 onions, 4 leaves of sage, 4 leaves of lemon thyme not 
broken and 4 leaves of sweet myrtle, and boil them in a saucepan 
with sufficient water to cover them ; when done, pulp them through 
a sieve, removing the sage and thyme ; then add sufficient pulp of 
mealy potatoes to cause it to be sufficiently dry without sucking to 
the hand ; add pepper and salt and stuff the fowl. 

ROASTED GOOSE (Mrs. E.'s recipe). Wash it thoroughly with 
salt and water. Prepare some Irish potatoes by boiling them nicely 
and mashing smoothly with a tablespoonful of butter and lard ; chop 
2 onions that have been parboiled and add them to the potato ; 
then season highly with pepper and salt and a little powdered sage. 
Roast it slowly at first, and baste it with butter or lard ; dredge it 
with flour just before you bake it, to make it brown nicely. It 
will answer to bake dressed in the same way, but will require a pint 
of water in the oven or stewpan. When done, thicken the gravy 
with i spoonful of flour rubbed smooth with water and season with 
pepper and salt. Apple jelly is nice to eat with it. 

BOILED TURKEY (Forcemeat as for Roasted Turkey). Hen tur- 
keys are preferable for boiling, on account of their whiteness and 
tenderness, and one of moderate size should be selected, as a large 
one is not so suitable for this mode of cooking. They should not 
be dressed until they have been killed 2 or 3 days or longer, it the 
weather is cold, or they will neither look white nor will they be tender. 
Pluck the bird, carefully draw and singe it with a piece of white 
paper. Wash it inside and outside and wipe it thoroughly dry with 
a cloth. Cut off the head and neck, draw the strings or sinews of 
the thighs and cut off the legs at the first joint ; draw the legs quite 
into the body, fill the breast with forcemeat, run a skewer through 
the wing and the middle joint of the leg, quite into the leg and wing 
on the opposite side ; break the breast-bone and make the bird 
look as round and as compact as possible. Then put the turkey 
into sufficient hot water to cover it, and let it come to a boil ; then 
carefully remove all the scum. If this is attended to there is no 
occasion to boil the bird in a floured cloth ; but it should be well 
covered with the water. Let it simmer very gently for about i 1-2 
to i 3-4 hours, according to the size, and serve with either white 
celery, oysters or mushroom sauce, or parsley and butter, a little of 
which should be poured over the turkey. Boiled ham, bacon, tongue 
or pickled pork should always accompany this dish ; and when oys- 
ter sauce is served, the turkey should be stuffed with oyster force- 
meat. A small turkey i 1-2 and a large one i 3-4 hours. Poultry 



GAME, EDIBLE BIRDS, ETC. 1^1 

for boiling should always be very fat. When the fowl or rabbit is 
old, rub the inside with soda instead of salt as soon as it is killed ; 
wash it off before cooking. A small portion of soda put into the water 
will make meat or vegetables more tender, better, and cook in a much 
shorter time. The flavor is greatly improved by it. 

TURKEY FOR CHRISTMAS DINNER (Soyer). Into i gallon of 
water put i teaspoonful of black pepper and 3 of salt. When the 
water boils, put on your turkey stuffed to your taste, 2 Ibs. salt ba- 
con cut in slices, 1-2 dozen onions, i Ib. of celery and i bunch of 
sweet herbs. Boil slowly i 1-2 hours. Mix 3 oz. flour with 2 oz. 
butter; add i pint of liquor from the pot and 1-2 pint of milk, take 
out the onions and celery, chop fine and add to the mixture and boil 
for 20 minutes ; then serve up your turkey and you have a delicious 
dish. 

TURKEY STUFFED WITH CHESTNUTS. Trim free from 
g r istle 10 oz of fillet of veal and i Ib. of fat bacon, season with i 
teaspoonful of salt, sage, parsley and celery. While chopping mois- 
ten with t gill of broth ; put the forcemeat in a mortar and pound 
it for 10 minutes ; put it in a basin and add 40 chestnuts previously 
slowly roasted and peeled ; draw and truss the turkey as in the 
recipe for roasted turkey. When cutting off the neck leave as much 
of the crop-skin as possible ; stuff the turkey with the forcemeat 
and chestnuts ; roast it before an even, but moderate fire for i hour 
and 40 minutes; take it off the spit, untie and put it on a dish. 
Free the gravy from all grease, pour it under the turkey and serve. 

ROASTED TURKEY WITH OYSTERS. Take the cooked turkey, cut 
up very fine, then lay the oysters and turkey alternately, then put 
between each layer a seasoning of cream and butter, pepper, salt, 
a little nutmeg, chopped onion, and finish on the top with bread 
crumbs sprinkled and bits of butter. Bake it, and when the oysters 
are done, serve it. 

GAME, EDIBLE BIRDS, &c. 

To ROAST A HAUNCH OF VENISON. Choose a haunch of veni- 
son with clear, bright and thick fat and the cleft of the hoof smooth 
and close ; the greater the quantity of fat there is the better qual- 
ity will the meat be, as many people object to venison when it 
has been kept too long. You can ascertain its soundness by run- 
ning a skewer into the meat near the bone ; when withdrawn its 
sweetness can be judged of. With care and attention it will keep 
two weeks, unless the weather is too mild. Keep it perfectly dry 
by wiping it with clean cloths till not the least damp remains; sprin- 
kle over ginger and pepper (powdered) as a preventive against the 



142 GAME, EDIBLE BIRDS, ETC. 

fly. When required for use wash it in warm water and dry it well 
with a cloth ; butter a sheet of white paper, put it over the fat, lay a 
coarse paste about 1-2 inch in thickness over this and then a sheet 
or two of strong paper. Tie the whole firmly on to the haunch with 
twine and put the joint down to a strong, close fire, baste the veni- 
son immediately to prevent the paper and string from burning; con- 
tinue this operation without interruption the whole of the time it is 
cooking about 20 minutes before it is done carefully remove the 
paste and paper, dredge the joint with flour and baste well with but- 
ter until frothed and of a nice pale brown color ; garnish the 
knuckle bone with a frill of white paper and serve with a strong, 
good and unflavored gravy in a tureen and currant jelly, or melt the 
jelly with a little port wine, and serve that also in a tureen. As the 
principal object in roasting venison is to preserve the fat, the above 
is the best mode of doing so when expense is not objected to, but 
in ordinary cases the paste may be dispensed with, and a double 
paper placed over the roast instead. It will not require so long a 
cooking without the paste. Do not omit to send very hot plates to 
the table, as the vennon so soon freezes ; to be thoroughly injoyed 
by epicures, it should be eaten on hot water plates. The neck 
should be roasted in the same manner. To cook with the paste re- 
quires from 4 to 5 hours, haunch of doe venison from 3 1-4 to 3 3-4 
hours. 

To BAKE FRESH VENISON HAM. Cut incisions lengthwise on 
the top if the ham is not very fat, insert narrow strips of i.am or 
pickled pork into these, press them below the surface and between 
the shank bone and meat, run a sharp, narrow bladed knife and 
insert the stuffing, tie it around well to prevent the stuffing from 
falling out. Spread over the surface of the meat a thick coating 
of butter, make a thin crust of coarse flour and water and lay 
over it; bake in a pan, pour in a cupful of water; when 1-2 done 
season with pepper and salt, take off the crust, bake it well and 
dredge with flour and bake till ot a light brown ; carve as directed 
and serve with the accompaniments of roasted haunch of veni- 
son. 

To BOIL A HAUNCH OF VENISON. Let it lie in salt, then boil 
it in a floured cloth, allowing 1-4 hour for every Ib. For sauce 
boil in milk and water and some cauliflowers pulled into sprigs with 
white cabbage and turnips cut into dice and beet root sliced. First 
lay a sprig of 'cauliflower and some of the turnips mashed with cream 
and butter ; next the cabbage that has been beaten in a sauce pan 
with a little butter and salt, then cauliflower, and so on until the dish 
is full. Intermix the beet here and there to variagate the appear- 
ance ; serve with melted butter. A neck of venison may be done in the 



GAME, EDIBLE BIRDS, ETC 143 

same manner, and both will eat well the next day; hashed with gravy 
and tomato or mushroom sauce or catsup. 

To FRY VENISON. If it is the neck or breast of venison, bone 
it, but if it be a shoulder cut off the meat in slices, make some gravy 
with the bones, then fry the meat brown ; take it up and keep it hot 
before the fire, put butter and flour in the pan and keep the whole 
stirring till thick and brown, taking care that it does not burn. If 
approved, stir in 1-2 pound of fine sugar, powdered, and put in the 
gravy produced by the bones with some port wine ; give the whole 
the consistency of cream, squeeze the juice of a lemon to these and 
turn the venison in it, put it in a dish and pour the sauce over it. 

To DUESS PLOVERS. Three plovers, butter, flour, toast bread. 
In cleaning and trussing, choose those that are hard at the vent, as 
that shows their fatness. There are three sorts of plover - the gray, 
the green and the lopwing. They will keep good for some time, but 
if very stale the feet will become dry. Plovers are scarcely fit for 
anything but toasting; they are, however, sometimes stewed or made 
into a ragout, but this mode of cooking is not to be recommended. 
Pluck off the feathers, wipe the outside of the bird with a damp 
cloth, and do not draw them ; truss with the head under the wings, 
put them down to a clear fire and lay slices of moistened toast in 
the dripping pan to catch the trail ; keep them well basted, dredge 
them lightly with flour a few minutes before they are done, let them 
be nicely basted with a feather, dish them in toasts, over which the 
trail should be equally spread, pour around the toast a little good 
gravy and send some to table in a tureen. Cook from 10 to 16 min- 
utes. Sufficient for 2 persons. 

To DRESS THE PTARMIGAN OR WHITE GROUSE. Two or 3 birds ; 
butter, flour, fried bread crumbs ; the ptarmigan or white grouse, 
when young and tender are exceedingly fine eating, and should 
be kept as long as possible to be good. Draw, pluck and truss them 
before a brisk fire, flour and butter them nicely and serve on but- 
tered toasts with a tureen of brown gravy. Bread sauce, when liked, 
may be sent to the table with them, and fried bread crumbs substi- 
tuted for the bread toast. Sufficient for i dish. Cook 1-2 hour. 

IMITATION of BONED TURKEY. Three and one-half Ibs. of veal 
chopped fine, 1-4 Ib. of fat salt pork, two eggs beaten, a little salt, 
nutmeg and parsley; mix and make in a roll; bake 3 hours in a 
moderate oven. To be eaten cold; a nice lunch. 

To SEMI-STEW BIRDS. Prepare them as for broiling, heat the 
gridiron and lay the birds flat upon it, the inside first; when 1-2 
done and of a bright color (but they must not be scorched) take 
them from the gridiron and lay them in a stew pan, pour over a 
tumbler of hot water, season with pepper and salt; rub a teaspoon^

ful of flour into a tablespoonful of butter; put this in slices over 
the birds, cover the dish and set it on the stove. When tender serve 
with tomato sauce. 

N. B. In roasting or baking game of any kind put them all in 
a paper bag greased inside and out with leaf drippings, butter or 
lard, lay the bag in the stove pan without water and cook till done, 
then take them out and brown them a little. The paper keeps the 
flavor from escaping while cooking. The game can be stuffed be- 
fore cooking. 

To ROAST A FAWN. A fawn must not be kept like venison, but 
dressed soon after it is killed. If it is not too large it is generally 
trussed for roasting like a hare, filled with hare stuffing, rubbed over 
with butter, larded with fat bacon and covered with buttered paper. 
It must be spitted like a hare and basted continually. It will take 
i 1-2 hour to roast it, but when 1-2 done the paper and larding must 
be removed, the fawn dredged with flour and a little salt, and basted 
till quUe ready. It may be served with good gravy and currant 
jelly, or still better, with venison sauce. A young fawn is delicious 
dressed in this way whole, but when older must be roasted in quar- 
ters and cut like lamb. The hind quarter is the choice part, and 
ought to be roasted with a covering of bacon and paper like the 
whole fawn, and served with the same sauce. 

To HASH FAWN. Put into a stew pan a pint of good gravy, 1-2 
dozen mushrooms, a shallot and a spoonful of butter rolled in flour, 
pepper and salt; simmer 1-2 hour, strain the gravy, have the meat 
cut in neat slices and put in. Keep the stew pan at the side of the 
fire that it may not boil, add a glass of port wine, a teaspobnful of 
lemon juice and the same of sugar. Shake all together for 5 min- 
utes, then serve. 

Though the flesh of the goat is eaten in this country, that of the kid 
is more delicate, and when carefully prepared and cooked, resembles 
game, and is a useful resource for making out a dinner. If very 
young it is best to dress it whole, and it should be soaked for twelve 
hours in a marinade of a pint of vinegar, a pint of cold water, 1-2 
pint of port wine, 3 ounces of salt and i ounce of brown sugar. 
When taken out it should be hung up for a day or two, washing sev- 
eral times with the marinade. 

To ROAST KID. After the kid has been marinaded as directed, 
either whole or in joints, it must be rubbed over with butter, if 
whole, stuffed like a hare and roasted in nice buttered paper (a 
light brown paper), as directed for the fawn, about the same time. 
Any sauce for hare or venison may be served with it. 

To HASH KID. Make a good gravy as for fawn and slice the 
kid into it, add port wine, lemon, and sugar, and serve with French 
beans or spinach. 



GAME, EDIBLE BIRDS, ETC. 145 

KID A LA POULETTE. Instead of the marinade the kid must 
be prepared by soaking in milk and water, and in which a spoon- 
ful of salt has been dissolved for 6 hours. It must be larded and 
1-2 roasted, and when cold cut a neat piece from the joint, leaving 
the rest to hash. Put the pieces in a stew pan with a pint of good 
veal stock, 2 ounces of butter rolled in flour, a shallot, a sprig of 
parsley, 6 mushrooms, a teaspoonful of pepper, 2 teaspoonfuls of 
salt, a blade of mace pounded. Stew all gently for i hour, then 
take out the meat, strain the sauce, thicken with the yolk of an egg 
beaten with 2 tablespoonfuls of cream, and pour over the kid ; line 
with sliced lemon. 

ROAST TEAL. Teal, butter, a little flour. Choose fat, plump birds, 
after the frost has set in, as they are then better flavored, truss them 
before a brisk fire and keep them well basted. Serve with brown 
gravy or onion gravy, water cresses and a cut of lemon. The re- 
mains of the teal make excellent hash. Roast from 10 to 15 min- 
utes ; 2 sufficient for a dish, 

ROAST WIDGEON. Widgeons, a little flour and butter. These 
are trussed in the same manner as wild duck, but not kept so long 
before they are dressed ; put them down to a brisk fire, flour and 
baste them continually with butter, and when browned and nicely 
frothed send them to the table hot and quickly; serve with brown 
gravy or orange gravy and a cut lemon, 1-4 hour, if liked well done, 
20 minutes ; 2 sufficient for a dish. 

ROAST LARKS. Larks, eggs and bread crumbs, and fresh butter. 
These birds are esteemed a great delicacy and may either be toasted 
or broiled. Pick and clean them well, when trussed brush them over 
with the yolk of an egg, sprinkle with bread crumbs and roast before 
a quick fire ; baste them continually with fresh butter and keep 
sprinkling with bread crumbs until the birds are well covered. Dish 
them in bread crumbs fried in butter and garnish the dish with slices 
of lemon. Broiled larks are excellent; they should be cooked over 
a clear fire, and would take about 10 or 15 minutes. 

IF YOUNG PRAIRIE CHICKENS. Dress, singe them, cut them up, 
dredge with corn meal or flour and fry them in nice sweet lard a nice 
brown ; prepare a cream gravy if you like, and pour over them in 
the dish ; serve hot. They are delicious. 

IF the chicken is old take some slices of sweet fat bacon or pork, 
a large pinch of powdered cloves, 2 or 3 onions cut up, pepper and 
salt to taste, and stew until the meat leaves the bones, then thicken 
with new milk or cream and a very little flour, and you have almost 
a royal dish. 

PRAIRIE CHICKEN STEAK. Cut in slices from the chicken, then 
broil; butter, pepper and salt them and serve on hot plates as lecf- 



146 GAME, EDIBLE BIRDS, ETC. 

steak. They can also be fried in drippings, butter, lard, dipped in 
egg and crumbs or in batter. 

N. B. A stew can be made of the remainder of the chicken. 

ROASTED TURKEY A LA CHIPOLATA. Prepare your turkey for 
stuffing, then make a stuffing of veal and chestnuts, or pork sausage 
meat may be used ; then prepare the chestnuts taking 4 dozen 
and splitting them across fry them in a little butter or sweet oil in a 
frying-pan, when the shells will come off without trouble ; then boil 
them in good broth or soup until soft enough to mash ; save 2 dozen 
to put in the sauce, and the others to put in the filling, then stuff the 
fowl and lay in the baking-pan, then cover it with thin slices of ba- 
con, secured by tying a string over to keep the bacon slices in place ; 
then put it into an oiled paper bag. When nearly done, remove 
from the paper bag and put it back and roast a nice brown. Dish 
and garnish to suit the taste. 

WASHING FOWLS OF ANY KIND. After dressing them wash them 
in a little soda water. Others say it takes away the juices of the 
flesh and spoils the flavor. 

Tun KEY GRAVY (A Good Housekeeper). Heart, liver, gizzard 
and neck cut up thin and dredged thickly with flour. Put in a sauce- 
pan with a little salt, a few pepper corns, allspice and a little mace, out- 
side skin not the husk of 3 onions, a lump of butter the size of a 
large walnut ; stew or fry until well browned ; add boiling water till 
of proper thickness, and let it cook all the morning on the corner of 
the stove. After removing the turkey from the dripping-pan and 
pouring off any grease, put the prepared gravy into the dripping-pan 
and make as any other gravy. r 

^ To ROAST A BONED TURKEY. Lay it in a deep baking-tin and 
cover it with slices of fat salt pork ; put it into a moderately hot 
oven and let it roast very slowly for 3 hours, with the door partly 
open. If the oven be too hot, or the pork not fat enough to 
keep the bird moist, it will brown. It is much better to stew it, as 
in the preceding recipe, or roast in a paper bag greased with fresh 
drippings. When done, remove the bag, and set to brown a few 
minutes, and serve. 

NOTE. A glaze or jelly for covering or garnishing the roasted 
turkey may be made by putting the bones of the bird into a stew- 
pan with all the herbs and vegetables mentioned for stewed turkey, 
and adding i quart of water. .This, when gently stewed for 2 
hours, strained and set aside to cool, will give at least i pint of 
strong jelly. If the jelly be not solid when cold, it may be re- 
duced in quantity by boiling it 1-2 an hour longer over a brisk 
fire, taking care that it does not burn, and stirring frequently. 

To STEW TURKEY. Take a fine turkey and bone it, and put into 



GAME, EDIBLE BIRDS, ETC. 147 

the carcas a stuffing composed of large livers, mushrooms, smoked 
bacon, all cut in small dice and mingled with salt, fine spices, chopped 
parsley and oniony. Sew the turkey up, and take care to shape it 
nicely ; then put a thin slice of bacon on the breast and wrap it in a 
cloth. Stew it in a pot, but not too large a one, with good 
broth, a glass of white wine, parsley, thyme, and celery. When 
it is done, strain the liquor in which the turkey was stewed, into a 
stew pan, after having taken off the pot ; reduce it to sauce, 
adding a spoonful of caulis or oysters. Then unwrap your turkey, 
take off the bacon, dry away the grease and serve with sauce. 

WOODCOCK THE SPORTSMAN'S FASHION English style. Roast 2 
of the birds rather underdone, catching their trails upon a large piece 
of toasted bread ; when done cut each bird into quarters, which 
place in a stew pan with the remainder of the trail cut small, a little 
pepper, salt, a glass of sherry, a little chopped shallot, the juice of 
1-2 a lemon, 1-2 a gill of broth; let the whole simmer very gently 
for a few minutes, dress the pieces of woodcock rather high upon 
the toast, pour the sauce over and serve. 

PARTRIDGES STEWED WITH CABBAGE. Have your birds nicely 
trussed and cleaned, then run 5 or 6 slices of fat bacon about 1-2 as 
thick as your hand and 1-2 as long, through the breast, so as not 
to stick out, then roast them in a moderate oven, then divide a cab- 
bage head in 4 pieces after washing it well in salt and water, then 
boil it in simple water, drain it dry, season highly with salt and pep- 
per, then some chopped onion, 1-2 pound of fat and lean bacon and 
put them in a stew pan, then cover the whole with some good butter 
and let simmer 3-4 of an hour till nearly dry before putting in the 
partridges, keeping the whole hot, but not boiling, for about i hour ; 
have ready 2 nicely broiled pork sausages, dress the cabbage, which 
should be quite dry, upon your dish in a mound with the birds at the 
top, but half buried in the mound, cut the bacon in halves, placing 
a piece at each end with a sausage at each side, pour a cupful of 
game sauce around and serve. It is very nice served with good plain 
gravy. 

PARTRIDGES TO BROIL. Divide them in two, dip them in melted 
butter in- which a mite of corn starch has been stirred, cover thickly 
with bread crumbs ; boil 1-4 hour. Young rabbits, hares and birds . 
can be broiled in the same way. 

To BOIL GROUSE. These must be boiled in plenty of water ; 
1-2 or 3-4 hour will be sufficient to cook them. For sauce stew some 
heads of celery cut very fine and thickened with cream and a small 
piece of butter rolled in flour and seasoned with salt to your palate. 
When your bird is done pour the sauce over it and garnish the dish 
with thin slices of lemon. 



148 GAME, EDIBLE BIRDS, ETC- 

ANOTHER WAY. Truss the grouse the same way as turkey, stuff 
the breast with veal stuffing, put it in hot water with 2 spoonfuls of 
chopped and boiled mutton suet; serve celery or oyster sauce over 
it. Snipes may be cooked in the same way. 

To BOIL QUAILS. Doves, larks, prairie hens, pigeons and rob- 
bins are all cooked alike, after they are picked, singed, the insides 
taken out as clean as possible, and then washed in several waters. 
Having cut off the pinions turn their legs under their wings, let them 
boil slowly 1-4 hour and they will be sufficiently done. Dish them 
up and pour over them good melted butter, lay around the dish a 
little brocoli and serve them up with melted butter and parsley in 
boats. They should be broiled by themselves, and may be eaten 
with bacon, greens, spinach or asparagus. 

To COOK PIGKONS (Petersburg, Va,) Mince cold veal and the 
fat of bacon, mix them with the crumbs of bread soaked in milk and 
well seasoned, with this forcemeat stuff the pigeons nicely, having 
them fresh and well cleaned; bake slowly till done, basting frequently 
with butter. Serve hot ; garnished with parsley. 

N. B. Wild pigeons may be cooked in the same way. 

NOTE Some housekeepers never use onions and sage together to 
season stuffing. 

To BROIL PIGEONS When the pigeons are trussed as for boiling 
flatten them with a cleaver, taking care not to break the skin of the 
backs or breasts; season them with pepper and salt, a little bit of 
butter and a teaspoonful of water, and tie them close at both ends; 
so that when they are brought to the table they bring their sauce with 
them. Egg and dredge them with grated bread or cracker dust ; if 
you please mix with spices, parsley and thyme, then lay them on the 
gridiron and turn them frequently ; if your fire is not very clear lay 
them on a sheet of paper well buttered to keep them from getting 
smoked. They are much better broiled whole ; when they are done 
pour over them either stewed or pickled mushrooms, tomato, or 
walnut catsup, or a squeeze of lemon. Garnish with fried bread 
crumbs or sippets of bread. 

ROAST PIG RONS. Pigeons, 2 spoonfuls of butter, pepper and salt 
to taste. Pigeons, to be good, should be eaten fresh ; if kept a lit- 
tle the flavor goes off. They should be drawn as soon as killed. 
Cut off the heads and necks, truss the wings over the backs and 
cut off the toes at the first joint previous to trussing ; they should 
be carefully cleaned, as no bird requires so much washing; wipe 
the birds very dry, season them inside with pepper and salt and 
put about 3-4 of a teaspoonful of butter into the body of each. 
This makes them moist. Put them down to a bright fire and 
baste them well the whole time they are cooking. In 20 or 30 



GAME, EDIBLE BIRDS, ETC. 149 

minutes they will be done ; garnish with fried parsley ; bread sauce 
and gravy, the same as for roast fowl, are an exceedingly nice accom- 
paniment to roast pigeon, and also egg sauce ; serve in a tureen of 
parsley and butter. 

To STEW PIGEONS. See that they are quite fresh and care- 
fully cleaned, drawn and washed; then soak them 1-2 hour. In 
the meantime cut a hard white cabbage in slices into water, drain it, 
and then boil it in milk and water; drain it again, and lay some of 
it at the bottom of the stew pan, put the pigeons upon it, but first 
season them well with pepper and salt and cover them with the re- 
mainder of the cabbage, add a little broth and stew gently till the 
pigeons are tender, then put among them 2 or 3 spoonfuls of cream 
and a piece of butter and flour for thickening. After a boil or two 
serve the birds in the middle of the dish and the cabbage placed 
around them. 

A GOOD WAY TO CATCH WOOD PIGEONS. Take corn or horse 
beans with 3 or 4 holes punched in them with an iron bodkin, then 
boil the same in gin ; many will be so drunk they cannot fly up ; oth- 
ers will perch in the adjacent trees; watch them, and you will see 
them tumble down. 

WOODCOCKS A LA LUCULLUS. Roast the birds plainly, catching 
the trails upon slices of toast, upon which, when done, dress 
them on a dish ; have ready a little fresh melted butter, with which 
mix the yolk of an egg and a little cream ; pour this over the wood- 
cocks, sprinkle lightly with bread crumbs, salamander of a light 
brown color and serve with a little gravy around. 

ROASTED OR BAKKD RABBIT. Have the same stuffing as for veal 
and turkey. Skin, empty, and thoroughly wash the rabbit, wipe it 
dry, line the inside with the forcemeat as for turkey, &c., mince and 
add the liver, sew the stuffing inside, skewer back the head be- 
tween the shoulders, cut off the fore joints of the shoulders and legs, 
bring them close to the body and secure them by means of a skewer. 
Wrap the rabbit in buttered paper and put down to a clear fire, 
keep it well basted, and a few minutes before it is done remove the 
paper" flour and froth it, and let it acquire a nice brown color, take 
out the skewers and serve with brown gravy and red currant jelly. 
To bake the rabbit proceed in the manner as above in a good 
oven. It will take the same time as roasting, young rabbit 35 min- 
utes, a large one 3-4 hour. Sufficient for 4 persons. 

ROAST HARK. Choose a young hare, which may be known by 
its smooth and sharp claws and by the cleft in the lip not being much 
spread. To be eaten in perfection it must hang for some time, and 
if properly taken care of it may be kept for several days. It is bet- 
ter to hang without being paunched; but should it be previously 



I5O GAME, EDIBLE BIRDS, ETC. 

emptied wipe the inside every day and sprinkle over it a little pep- 
per and ginger to prevent the musty taste, which long keeping in the 
damp occasions, and which also affects the stuffing. After it is skin- 
ned wash it well and soak for an hour in warm water to draw out 
the blood ; if old, let it lie in vinegar for a short time, but wash it 
well afterwards in several waters. Make a stuffing as for veal and 
.turkey. Wipe the hare dry, fill it up with the stuffing and sew it up, 
bring the hind and fore legs close to the body, towards the head, run 
a skewer through each, fix the head between the shoulders by means 
of another skewer, and be careful to leave the ears on, put a string 
round the body from skewer to skewer and tie it above the back. 
The hare should be kept at a distance from the fire when it is first 
laid down, or the outside will become dry and hard before the inside 
is done. Baste it well with milk for a short time and afterwards with 
butter ; and particular attention must be paid to basting, so as to pre- 
serve the meat on the back juicy and nutritive. When it is almost 
roasted enough flour the hare and baste well with butter ; when nicely 
frothed dish it, remove the skewers and send it to table with a little 
gravy in the dish and a tureen of the same. Red currant jelly must 
not be forgotten, as this is an indispensable accompaniment to roast 
hare. For economy good beef drippings may be substituted for the 
milk and butter to baste with but the basting, as we have before 
stated, must be continued without intermission. If the liver is good 
it may be parboiled, minced and mixed with the stuffing, but should 
not be used unless quite fresh. A middling-sized hare cooks i 1-2 
hours ; a large hare from i 1-2 to 2 hours. 

N. B. In roasting large and small birds put them in a buttered 
paper bag, all together in a stew pan and roast them ; the buttered 
paper prevents the steam from escaping, and they are much better 
by it when done. Take them out, season and serve to taste. 

FRENCH RABBIT, How TO COOK (Ma'm V.) Take a rabbit. and 
skin it, commencing at the head ; with a damp cloth wipe the rabbit 
clean, do not wash it ; then simmer in a pan a piece of butter the 
size of an egg, then cut the rabbit up and lay in the pan containing 
the hot butter, adding some salt and a pinch of beaten pepper, a few 
whole cloves, allspice and peppers, some thyme and parsley, all to 
taste. When ready to serve, after laying the rabbit on a hot dish, 
stir by degrees a little flour into the gravy to thicken it, adding 1-2 pint 
of claret wine. * 

BOILED RABBIT. For boiling choose rabbits with smooth and 
sharp claws, as that denotes they are young. Should these be blunt 
and rugged, the ears long and rough, the animal is old. After empty- 
ing and skinning it wash it well in cold water and let it soak for 
about 1-4 hour in warm water, to draw out the blood. Bring the 



GAME, EDIBLE BIRDS, ETC. 15! 

head around to the side and fasten it there by means of a skewer 
run through that and the body. Put the rabbit into sufficient hot 
water to cover it, let it boil gently till tender, which will be in from 
1-2 to 3-4 hour, according to its size and age. Dish it and smother 
it either with onions, liver or mushrooms, sauce or parsley and but- 
ter. The former is, however, generally preferred to any of the last- 
named sauces. When liver sauce is preferred the liver should be 
boiled for a few minutes and minced finely or rubbed through a sieve 
before it is added to the sauce. A young rabbit or hare should cook 
1-2 hour, a larger one 3-4 hour, an old one i hour or longer; squir- 
rels may be cooked in the same way. 

STEWED RABBIT (Pacific Slope.) Skin the rabbit, then wash and 
soak thoroughly, then with a clean cloth wipe it as dry as possible, 
cut it up and roll the pieces in flour and slightly brown it in 1-4 Ib. 
of sweet butter, adding some lean bits of ham, then gradually add 3 
cups of gravy and stew the meat very gently for nearly 2 hours, or 
less time ; add salt to taste and half the rind of lemon cut very thin. 
Mix an even tablespoonful of rice flour with 2 tablespoonfuls of mush- 
room catsup, a large pinch of powdered mace and a small pinch of 
cayenne. Stir well, pour in the stew, cook 10 minutes, then serve 
hot. 

To BROIL RABBIT OR HARE. Season them first and broil them 
on a gridiron, rub them with cold butter and serve them hot. 
The other pieces warmed with gravy and a little stuffing may be 
sent up separately ; or the hare may be split open, seasoned with 
pepper and salt and broiled on the griddle, the body slit and 
gashed neatly across and lengthwise and basted with cider vine- 
gar; butter, pepper and salt frequently. 

SQUIRRKL STEW. After the squirrels are properly cleaned and 
lain in salt and water for a time, then cut up and boil 2 hours 
for young squirrels and 3 hours for old ones in just enough water 
to cover them. Never season them till done tender, and then you 
will add salt and cream or nice fresh butter to your judgment. 
Make a thickening of a tablespoonful of flour stirred in 1-2 cup 
of milk or water, then add this while the pot is boiling, making 
a nice gravy. Pour the whole over slices of bread or split butter 
crackers, or biscuit, and serve. 

NOTE As the strong flavor comes from the fat this should be cut 
away before cooking. 

FRIED SQUIRREL (Mrs. Baringer.) Cut them up and parboil in 
water with a little salt, if old. If young, this is not needed; sea- 
son with pepper and salt and dip each piece in beaten yolk of egg 
and grated cracker, and fry in hot lard of a nice brown. 

BROILED SQUIRREL. Parboil the squirrel whole for a few minutes, 



152 FRICASSEES. 

grease the broiler or gridiron, put it on and turn it often over a.clear 
fire, season with drawn or melted butter, peeper, salt, and moisten 
the squirrels with it. 

SQUIRREL PIE. Parboil the squirrel in salt and water, line a bak- 
ing dish with nice pastry, cut the squirrels in pieces in the pan with 
a slice of bacon and 2 hard boiled eggs ; fill the pan with cream 
and season with black pepper and cover it with a crust and bake. 

FRICASSEES. 

To FRICASSEE CHICKENS. Boil 1-4 hour in a small quantity of 
water ; let them cool ; cut up and put to simmer in a little gravy 
made of the liquor they are boiled in and a bit of veal or mutton, 
onion, mace and lemon peel, some white pepper, parsley and thyme. 
When quite tender, keep them hot while you thicken the sauce in 
the following manner: Strain it off and put it back into the sauce- 
pan with a little salt, a scrape of nutmeg, and a bit of flour and 
butter; give it one boil, and when you are going to serve it, beat up 
the yolk of an egg, add 1-2 pint of cream, and stir them over the 
fire, but do not let it boil. It is often done without the egg. The 
gravy may be made (without any other meat) of the necks, feet, 
small wing-bones, gizzards and livers, which are called the trimmings 
of the fowls. 

To FRICASSEE CHICKENS WHITE. Cut up each chicken into eight 
pieces, as in carving them at table. Wash, dry, flatten and season 
them with mixed spices, using only white pepper. Dip the pieces 
in egg, and brown them lightly in fresh butter. Take a pint of 
clear veal or mutton gravy, and put to it a roll of lemon peel, 2 
onions, 3 blades of mace, a little parsley and lemon thyme. Stew 
the browned chicken in this very slowly for 1-2 hour, keeping 
the stew-pan covered. Strain the sauce and thicken it with but- 
ter rolled in flour, salt and a rasp of nutmeg. When ready to 
be served, add 1-4 pint of cream, the yolk of i or 2 eggs well 
beaten. Do not have it too hot, but mix this very carefully, lest 
it curdle, and be sure it does not boil. A glass of white wine 
and a squeeze of lemon may be put to the fricassee. 

FRICASSEE OF CHICKEN A LA ST. LAMBERT. Prepare and cut two 
chickens as directed for fricassee of chicken. Steep the pieces in 
cold water for 1-2 hour; drain and put them in a sauce-pan with 
some gravy, i carrot, i onion and a bunch of parsley, and drain 
the pieces of chicken when they are done. Strain the gravy 
or broth through a broth-napkin; reduce it to 1-2; add i 1-2 
pint of nice sauce to it, and reduce both together until the sauce 
coats the spoon. Thicken it with egg and strain through a tam- 



FRICASSEES. 153 

my-cloth into a pan. Wipe and trim the pieces of chicken, put 
them in a stew-pan, pour in enough sauce to cover them, and 
warm them without boiling ; dress them on a dish, pour over some 
of the sauce out of the pan, garnish round with small portions of 
carrots cut to an olive shape, butter, onions previously boiled in white 
broth, and asparagus, peas, and serve with the remainder of the 
sauce in a boat. 

To FRICASSEE CHICKENS. Prepare your chickens as for frying, 
then let them remain i hour in cold water in a cool place; change 
the water, then add some salt and let them remain in this i hour. 
Put them into a stew-pan with just enough water to cover them, some 
salt, pepper and a cup of cream or milk. Mix a large spoonful of 
butter and flour together, and add to the stew or fricassee, and cook 
all together for i hour. Before serving, add some minced parsley or 
celery and 2 well-beaten eggs. Mix thoroughly. 

CHICKEN FRICASSEED {Mrs. T. B. S.). For a two-o'clock dinner. 
At 12 o'clock kill, clean and cut up 2 chickens, then into a skillet put 
2 heaped tablespoonfuls of lard, then stir into it gradually 2 table- 
spoonfuls of flour, until of a nice brown; ir.to the lard put small 
onions chopped. Lay in the chicken and fry of a good brown. 
Pour in 3 pints of boiling water. Flavor with minced parsley, black 
pepper and 2 cloves. Cover it up and boil until reduced one-half; 
then in a small bowl put the yolks of 2 well-beaten eggs, 2 table- 
spoonfuls each of vinegar and wine, a little Worcester sauce, and 
stir well together. Then into the mixture stir 4 spoonfuls of hot 
gravy, then pour into the gravy and stir it over the fire for a moment, 
and pour it over the chicken, which has been'laid in a hot dish, and 
serve at once. 

FRICASSEE OF CHICKENS THICKENED WITH MILK OF ALMONDS. 
Cut up 2 chickens as directed for fricassee of chickens a la St. Lam- 
bert. Blanch, drain, wipe and trim the pieces ; put them in a stew- 
pan with i quart of nice sauce and i pint of chicken broth. When 
the chicken is done, pour the liquor out of the stew-pan into an- 
other ; skim off the fat and reduce the sauce until it coats the spoon ; 
then strain it on the pieces of chicken in the stew-pan ; boil up to- 
gether and thicken the sauce with some milk of almonds, prepared 
as follows : First blanch and peel 2 oz. of sweet almonds, wash and 
pound them in a mortar, moistening them with 1-2 pint of milk; 
when well pounded, press them through a broth-napkin into a basin. 
Take the fricassee off the fire, let it cool for a minute and pour the 
mik of almonds with one hand, while tossing the contents of a stew- 
pan with the other, so as to mix and thicken the sauce. Dress the 
fricassee on a dish and serve. 

FRICASSEED TURKEY. Cut up a small, young turkey and rinse it 



154 FRICASSEES. 

in cold water ; put it in a stew-pan with water to cover it ; cover the 
stew-pan and set it over a gentle fire ; remove the froth as it rises ; 
when tender add salt to taste, a heaped spoonful of pepper, 4 oz. 
sweet butter and a tablespoonful of flour ; stir well with a s'poon. 
Scald some parsley, chop it small, put it into the turkey stew and 
cover it closely. Simmer for 20 minutes. Serve hot for breakfast 
with rice, hominy or potatoes. 

To FRICASSEE PIGEONS. Cut them in pieces and fry brown ; lay 
them in a stew-pan with gravy and let them remain an hour, at the end 
of which time put in a slice of lemon, a spoonful of mushroom cat- 
sup and a little browning. Let them stew 5 minutes longer, take 
them up, thicken the gravy with butter and flour and strain over the 
birds. Lay forcemeat balls around the dish and garnish with pickles. 

To FRICASSEE EGGS. Boil your eggs 10 minutes, or until entirely 
hard. Take them up and drop them into a vessel of cold water 
until cold enough to remove the shells smoothly. Beat up one or 
more raw eggs, according to what is required. Roll the hard-boiled 
eggs in the beaten egg ; then in fine bread crumbs and let them dry, 
turning them. Fry in hot lard or oil. Use as an accompaniment roasted 
or baked meat, with a rich gravy. They may be cut in two, if de- 
sired ; take out the yolk and fill each end with nice stuffing ; unite 
them or not, as preferred ; roll in raw beaten eggs, then in powdered 
bread crumbs, and fry. 

To FRICASSEE RABBITS WHITE. To fricassee rabbits white, you 
must cut them up as for eating, and then put them into a stew-pan 
with a pint of veal gravy, a little beaten mace, a slice of lemon, a 
teaspoonful of lemon juice, a little cayenne pepper and salt. Let 
them stew over a gentle fire until done enough ; then take them out 
and lay them in your dish. Thicken the gravy with butter and flour ; 
then strain it and add the yolks of 2 eggs, mixed with a gill of thick 
cream and a little grated nutmeg, stir these well together, and when 
it begins to simmer pour it quite hot over your rabbits, and serve 
them hot. 

To FRICASSEE RABBITS BROWN. Cut them into pieces as before 
directed and fry them in butter of a light brown ; then put them in 
a stew-pan with a pint of water, a slice of lemon, a large spoonful 
of lemon juice, a little cayenne pepper and salt. Stew them over 
a slow fire until enough done ; then thicken your gravy with butter 
and flour, and strain it. Dish up your rabbits and pour your gravy 
over them. Garnish with sliced lemon. 

FRICASSEED LAMB'S FRIRS. Skin and wash them, dry and flour 
them, and fry of a beautiful brown in fresh hog's lard ; lay them on a 
sieve before the fire until you have made the following sauce : 
Thicken almost 1-2 pint of veal gravy with a bit of flour and

butter, and then add to it a slice of lemon, a large spoonful of 
mushroom catsup, a teaspoonful of lemon pickle, a grate of nut- 
meg and the yolk of an egg beaten well in 2 large spoonfuls of 
thick cream. Put this over the fire and stir it well until it is hot 
and looks white ; but do not let it boil, or it will curdle ; then 
put in the fry and shake it about near the fire for a moment or 
two. Serve in a very hot covered dish. Those of hogs may be 
cooked in the same way, or simply slightly salted and fried in 
new hog's lard. 

AN EXCELLENT FRENCH FRICASSEE OF BEANS so AS TO RESEMBLE 
THE TASTE OF MEAT. Take Lima, butter or sugar beans, and alter 
boiling them sufficiently to eat, brown some butter, taking ca-re to 
season well with salt, in an iron bake-pan or spider previously warmed 
or heated. Put into it your beans, after letting them drain for a few 
minutes, and fry them until they begin to turn brown, then mix with 
the'm a few onions finely chopped, and continue the frying for a short 
time longer, adding some parsley. When the beans appear to be 
nearly done, add a little water to them, some salt, black pepper to 
taste, and dredge well with flour. When done, stir into them the 
yolk of an egg beaten with a spoonful of water and add a small 
portion of vinegar. A spoonful of catsup should be put in with the 
flour. 

FRICASSEE OF PARSNIPS. Boil in milk until they are soft ; then cut 
them lengthwise into bits 2 or 3 inches long, and simmer in a white 
sauce made of 2 spoonfnls of broth, a bit of mace, 1-2 cupful of 
cream, a bit of butter and some flour, pepper and salt. 

To FRICASSEE SALMON. Cut a piece of salmon into small slices, 
mince some parsley and thyme, season the fish with salt, mace, cloves, 
ginger, nutmeg powdered small and well mixed. Put into a pan 
some clarified butter or lard ; make it very hot, then lay in the salmon 
and fry it quickly, taking care that it does not burn. When 3-4 
done, pour off the fat and supply its place with white wine, oys- 
ters and their liquor, a large onion, some minced thyme and a little 
nutmeg, to which add the yolks of 4 eggs beaten up with the liquor. 
Dish the fricassee with sippets, pour the sauce thereon and garnish 
with oysters. 

To FRICASSEE EELS. Skin 3 or 4 large eels, notch them from the 
head to the tail, cut each eel into 4 or 5 pieces and lay them in cleat 
water for 1-2 an hour; dry them in a cloth and put them into the 
pan with fresh butter, i or 2 onions and some chopped parsley. Set 
the pan on the fire and shake it for a few minutes, then put in a pint 
of white wine and the same quantity of gravy, with pepper, salt and 
a blade of mace. Stew the whole together 1-2 an hour, and then 
add the yolks of 4 or 5 eggs, some grated nutmeg and chopped 



156 VEGETABLES. 

parsley. Stir these well together and let them simmer 4 or 5 min- 
utes, after which put in the juice of an orange or lemon. Garnish 
with lemon in slices. 

To FRICASSEE LOBSTERS. When skinned and cleaned cut off the 
heads of the fish and dry them on a cloth. Separate the flesh from 
the bones and the fins, cut it first lengthwise and then across, so that 
each fish may be divided into 8 parts ; put the heads and bones in a 
pan with a pint of water, sage, parsley and thyme, an onion shreded, 
whole pepper, 2 or 3 blades of mace, a piece of lemon peel, a little 
salt and a crust of bread. Cover the whole closely and let it boil 
until reduced to 1-2 ; strain through a sieve and put the liquor into 
a stew-pan with the fish, adding 1-2 pint of white wine, some chopped 
parsley, a few mushrooms cut small, grated nutmeg and a piece of 
butter rolled in flour. Keep the pan shaking over a slow fire until 
the fish are done, then serve them up with the gravy and garnish 
with lemon. 

To FRICASSEE OYSTERS. Put into the pan a slice of ham, a bunch 
of parsley, thyme and an onion, with cloves; stew these over a 
gentle fire for a few minutes and add thereto a little flour, some good 
butter and a piece of lemon peel ; then put in the oysters and let 
the whole simmer until thoroughly hot. Thicken with the yolks of 
2 eggs, a little cream and a piece of butter; but take out the ham, 
herbs, onion and peel, adding, instead of the last, some of the juice, 
Shake the pan well, and when it simmers pour the whole into the 
dish. 

VEGETABLES. 

ASPARAGUS (To be Served with Entrees). For 8 people, take 
100 sticks of asparagus, scrape the white part of the stem from the 
head downward ; cut off so much of the base as shall leave each 
stick the same length and throw them as fast as they are done into 
cold water. When all are prepared tie them in bundles of 20, diop 
them into 1-2 gallon of fast boiling water, in which i heaped table- 
spoonful of salt has been dissolved. In about 10 minutes they will 
be done, if small. They must be watched until the moment they 
are tender. They should then be taken out of the water at once, 
drained dry and laid upon hot buttered toast in a round or oval dish 
and the stems outward. The toast should be dipped for a moment 
into the asparagus water. No sauce should be served with the 
asparagus, as that would interfere with the flavor of those in the 
entrees. 

ASPARAGUS ROLL (Mrs. N.'s) Boil the asparagus in salt and 
water, as for dinner ; when tender cut up all the eatable part and 



VEGETABLES. 157 

warm it again in sweet milk that is thickened with butter rubbed in 
flour, the yolks of well beaten raw eggs, a rasp or two of nutmeg, a 
small pinch of mace, being governed by the quantity of asparagus. 
Then, having the top crust taken off of some rolls, and the crumbs 
scooped out, fill up the hollow with the boiling asparagus mixture, 
which should not be very moist. Place the upper crust on and serve 
at once very hot. 

BOILED ASPARAGUS. To each 1-2 gallon of water allow i heaped 
tablespoonful of salt. In order to have the asparagus white, it should 
be cut before sunrise, as the action of the sun turns it green, and it 
should be put in a cool, damp place, and then dressed as soon as 
practicable. Like all vegetables, it cannot be cooked too fresh ; 
then scrape the outer skin off beginning at the head, and throw them 
into cold water, then tie them in bundles of about 20 in each, keep 
the heads all one way, then, with a sharp knife cut the stalks evenly 
and put them into boiling water with the above proportion of salt. 
Keep them boiling quickly until tender, with the saucepan uncov- 
ered. When the asparagus is done, dish it upon toast, which should 
be dipped in the water in which the asparagus has been boiled, then 
turn the white ends toward the middle each way, pour over them 
melted butter and pepper, 15 to 18 minutes from the time the water 
boils. 

ASPARAGUS AND BEANS. Cut the tender parts of the asparagus 
into 1-4 inch lengths, boil in an equal quantity of water, adding about 
an equal amount of well-cooked Linja beans. Cook until the aspar- 
agus is tender, season with pepper, salt, butter or cream, and serve 
hot. Instead of the beans the asparagus may be thickened with 
flour and cream, or with cracker crumbs and milk. 

ASPARAGUS OMELET. Boil the required quantity of asparagus and 
cut the tops and tender part into 1-2 inch lengths, season to taste 
with salt and pepper, and put aside on the stove to keep warm while 
you make your omelet. Beat the whites and yolks of 6 eggs to- 
gether, with a teaspoonful of milk for each egg, a salt spoonful of 
salt and a pinch of white pepper; brown 2 tablespoonfuls of 
sweet butter in a frying-pan, pour your eggs in, and as soon as 
it begins to set at the edges turn them up and shake your pan 
to keep the omelet from sticking. It will be sufficiently cooked 
in five minutes ; put your asparagus in, turn your omelet over it 
as you would a turn-over pie, and serve at once on a hot dish. 

BOILED ARTICHOKES. To each 1-2 gallon of water allow one 
heaped tablespoonful of salt, a piece of soda as large as a 25- 
cent piece. Wash the archichokes well in several waters, and see 
that no insects remain in them, and trim away the leaves at the 
bottom, cut off the stems and put them into boiling water, to 



158 VEGETABLES. 

which has been added salt, and soda in the above proportion. 
Keep the sauce-pan covered and let them boil quickly until ten- 
der, ascertain when they are done by pushing a fork into them, or 
by trying if the leaves can be easily removed. Take them out, 
let them drain for a minute or two and serve on a napkin with 
a little pepper, salt and melted* butter. This vegetable, unlike 
any other, is considered better for being gathered two or three 
days ; but they must be soaked and washed previous to dressing 
20 to 25 minutes after the water boils. 

ARTICHOKES, ITALIAN WAY. Four or five artichokes, salt and 
butter; about; 1-2 pint of gravy. Trim and cut the archichokes in 
quarters, boil them until tender in water mixed with a little salt 
and butter. When done, drain them well, and lay them all around 
the dish with the leaves outside. Have ready some good gravy 
highly flavored with mushrooms ; reduce it until quite thick and 
pour it around the artichokes and serve. Twenty to twenty-five 
minutes to boil the archichokes. 

FRIED ARTICHOKES. Five or six artichokes, salt and water ; 
for the batter 1-2 lb. of flour, a little salt, the yolk of i egg and 
milk. Trim and boil the artichokes and rub them over with 
lemon juice to keep them white. When they are quite tender, 
take them up remove the chokes and divide the bottoms ; 
dip each piece into the batter, fry them in hot lard or drippings and 
garnish with crisp parsley or the leaves, flowers and buds of nas- 
turtium. Serve with plain melted butter ; 20 minutes to boil, 5 to 
7 minutes to fry the artichokes. 

JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES May be sliced and boiled like turnips, 
or washed and cooked in any way that Irish potatoes are, but they 
require longer cooking and are deemed excellent when boiled or 
dressed as a salad when mashed and seasoned with pepper, salt 
and butter or cream. They may be cut in the shape of a pear ; 
cut off a piece at the bottom of each, that they may stand up- 
right in the dish, and pour over them some nice sauce. Twenty 
minutes to boil. They are also good roasted as potatoes. 

STEWKD CARROTS. Seven or 8 large carrots, i teaspoonful broth, 
pepper and salt to taste, 1-2 teaspoonful cream or milk, thickening 
of butter and flour. Scrape the carrots nicely ; half-boil, and slice 
them into a stew-pan, add the broth, pepper, salt and cream and 
simmer until tender and be careful that the carrots be not broken. 
A few minutes before serving mix a little flour with about i oz. of 
butter, and thicken the gravy with this ; let it just boil up, and then 
serve. Three-quarters of an hour to parboil the carrots ; 20 min- 
utes to cook them after they are boiled. 

To DRESS CARROTS IN THE GERMAN WAY. Eight large car- 



VEGETABLES. 159 

rots, 3 oz. butter, salt to taste, a very little grated nutmeg, i table- 
spoontul finely-minced parsley, i dessert-spoonful minced onion, 
rather more than i pint of weak stock or broth, and i tablespoonful 
flour. Wash and scrape the carrots and cut them into rings about 
1-2 an inch in thickness. Put the butter in a stew-pan; when it is 
melted lay in the carrots with salt, nutmeg, parsley and onions in the 
above proportions. Toss the stew-pan over the fire for a few min- 
utes, and when the carrots are well saturated with the butter, pour 
in the stock and simmer until they are nearly tender. Then put into 
another stewpan a small piece of butter, dredge in about a tea- 
spoonful of flour, stir this over the fire, and when of a nice brown 
color add the liquor that the carrots have been boiling in ; let this 
just boil up, pour it over the carrots in the other stew-pan and let 
them finish simmering until quite tender. Serve very hot. This 
vegetable, dressed as above, is a favorite accompaniment of roasted 
pork, sausages, beef, etc. Three-quarters of an hour to stew. 

BOILED CARROTS. To each 1-2 gallon of water allow i heaped 
tablespoonful of salt. Cut off the green tops and wash and scrape 
the carrots, and should there be any black specks, remove them. If 
large, cut them in halves, divide them lengthwise into 4 pieces and 
put them in boiling water, salted in the above proportion. Let them 
boil until tender, which may be ascertained by thrusting a fork into 
them ; dish and serve very hot. This vegetable is an indispensable 
accompaniment to boiled beef. When thus served it is usually boiled 
with the beef. A few carrots are placed around the dish, as a gar- 
nish, and the remainder sent to table in a vegetable dish. Young 
carrots do not require so much boiling, nor should they be divided. 
These are a nice addition to stewed veal, etc. Large carrots, i 3-4 
to 2 1-4 hours; young ones, 1-2 hour. 

SLICED CARROTS. Five or six large carrots, a large lump of sugar, 
i pint of weak stock, 3 oz. fresh butter, and salt to taste. Scrape 
and wash the carrots, cut them into slices of an equal size, and boil 
them in salt and water until half-done, drain them well, put them in 
a stew-pan with sage and stock, and let them boil over a" brisk fire. 
When reduced to a glaze, add the fresh butler and a seasoning of 
salt ; -shake the stew-pan about well, and when the butter is well- 
mixed with the carrots, serve. There should be no sauce in the 
dish when sent to table, but it should all adhere to the carrots. Al- 
together, 3-4 of an hour. Always in season. 

FRIED PARSNIPS AND BANANAS. Boil your parsnips and let them 
get cold, then slice and flour them slightly and they will resemble in 
flavor and appearance fried bananas. 

To COOK EGG PLANT. After cutting the slices 1-2 inch thick, lay 
them one upon the other in salt water to extract the bitter principle, 
and also a part of the juice. Then fry in the usual way. 



l6o VEGETABLES. 

EGG PLANT BAKED. Peel and parboil them, then squeeze them 
between two plates to dry them ; then season with a little onion, 
butter, pepper and salt. Put the mixture in a baking-dish, grate 
over some bread crumbs and bake a nice brown. 

STUFFED EGG PLANT. Cut off the stem-end of the plant and scoop 
out the inside with the handle of a spoon. Parboil the shell for 5 
minutes in water a little salted ; take it out, and at once plunge it 
into cold water ; then stew the flesh of the plant with pepper, salt 
and a little finely chopped onion, until done. Add to the stew, with 
butter to season it, i or more well-beaten eggs, (i heaped tea- 
spoonful, and i egg will be sufficient for i plant) ; mix well and 
stew until dry; put in 1-2 as ,much bread crumbs as egg plant; 
fill the plant shell with this ; a little minced veal, ham, tongue or 
poultry may be added to the forcemeat by way of improvement ; 
then tie on the piece which was cut off; put the stuffed eggs to bake 
in a dish, the bottom covered with slices of sweet bacon, and bake 
i hour. Serve on a flat dish. Remove the string and top-piece. 
The egg plant is often cut in two lengthwise, the contents removed 
and stewed as above, the 1-2 rind parboiled in salt and water until 
tender, then filled with a rich stuffing, a coating of egg poured over 
the open side, and bread crumbs sprinkled over ; put in a dish with 
slices of cold ham and bake until tender ; either way is good. 

EGG PLANTS SIUFFED. The pulp taken carefully out, then fill with 
savory meats. Tie a string around it and boil in salt and water. 
You may stuff them with any forcemeat you like. 

EGG PLANT FRIED. Boil the eggplant, and when cold slice, flour, 
and fry in butter or lard. 

BANANAS are fried in the same way, but they are not previously 
cooked. 

BOILED MUSHROOMS. Mushroom flaps, pepper and salt to taste, 
butter and lemon juice. Clean the mushrooms by wiping them with 
a piece of flannel and a little salt; cut off a portion of the stalk and 
peel the tops ; boil them over a clear fire, turning them once, and 
arrange them in a very hot dish. Put a small piece of butter on 
each mushroom ; season with pepper and salt and squeeze over them 
a lew drops of lemon juice. Place the dish before the fire, and when 
the butter is melted, serve very hot and quickly. Moderate-sized 
flaps are better suited to this mode of cooking than the buttons ; the 
latter are better in stews. Ten minutes to cook medium-sized mush- 
rooms. 

BAKED MUSHROOMS. 16 or 20 mushroom flaps, butter, and pep- 
per to taste. For this mode of cooking, the mushroom flaps are bet- 
ter than buttons, and should not be too large. Cut off a portion of 
the stalks, peel the top and wipe the mushrooms carefully with a 



VEGETABLES. l6l 

piece of flannel and a little fine salt. Put them in a tin baking-dish 
with a very small piece of butter placed on each mushroom ; sprinkle 
over a little pepper and bake for 20 minutes or longer, should the 
mushrooms be very large. Have ready a very hot dish, and pile the 
mushrooms high in the center, pour the gravy around and send them 
to table quickly with very hot plates. Twenty minutes ; large mush- 
rooms 1-2 hour. Mushrooms are difficult of digestion, and by no 
means nourishing. The best are those found in pasture grounds. 
Gardeners raise them in beds of old manure. The most of them 
are of suspicious qualities. 

STEWED MUSHROOMS. One pint of mushroom buttons, i oz. fresh 
butter, white pepper and salt to taste, lemon juice, i teaspoonful of 
flour, cream or milk, and 1-4 teaspoonful grated nutmeg. 

How TO COOK CELERY. Trim the roots and cut to about 6 
inches, three heads of celery. Wash them carefully, tie them to- 
gether with a string, put them into a sauce-pan with an onion, a 
blade of mace, some whole pepper, salt, and enough boiling wa- 
ter to cover them. Let them boil until tender, then drain them, 
remove the string and serve hot with white sauce over them. 

CELERY SUCKS WITH CREAM. Previous to cooking them, they 
must be washed well and properly trimmed ; this done, and the sterns 
cut to the requisite length, then boil in plenty water for 10 minutes, 
then put them in some liquor in which bacon has been boiled, salt 
them, then take them up and moisten them with the liquor from 
which the fat has been skimmed ; then pour over some wine or the 
juice of a lemon, cover them well, trim and dish them up, mash 
them in caramel sauce, reduced with cream. Celery stewed and 
covered simply with a little gravy and brown sauce is very nice. 

RADISHES should be gathered early in the morning ; wash them 
well and keep them in ice-cold water until time to serve them ; then 
break off the long tap root, and cut off all the top except an inch or 
two ; put them upon a salad bowl with lettuces, cresses, etc., or in 
glass stands, or on small dishes. The crimson ones are highly orna- 
mental. Radishes are more digestible, if grated and seasoned with 
pepper and salt ; used as a salad, and are often served raw. There 
are many varieties of the radish, and possess nearly the same prop- 
erties of the turnip. 

HORSE RADISH. This root, scraped, is always served with hot roast 
beef, mutton, veal, fowl, roast pork or any kind of meat cooked in 
any way, and also with fish and for garnishing. Gather the horse- 
radish, wash it well and let it remain in cold water for i hour before 
using it, then with a sharp knife scrape it into shreds, beginning with 
the upper part or large end of the root ; add a little salt, and ar- 
range it in a small dish, and the remainder for garnishing the joint. 



162 VEGETABLES. 

It should be placed in tufts around the border of the dish, with one 
or two bunches on the meat. The horse-radish is highly stimulat- 
ing and exciting to the stomach, and is recommended in chronic 
rheumatism, palsy, dropsical complaints, diseases of the kidneys 
(made into tea with cold water), and in cases of enfeebled digestion. 
It is used principally as a condiment to promote appetite and excite 
the digestive organs, and is highly anti-scorbutic. 

BOILED CABBAGE. Choose the dark green, crumpled cabbage, 
known as the Savoy. Take off the coarse outer leaves ; cut each 
cabbage in 4 ; remove a portion of the stalk ; wash them in warm 
salt and water, then throw them into cold salt and water for i hour. 
For 4 large cabbages or S small ones, have ready a vessel with i 1-2 
gallons of part boiling water, in which a teaspoonful of common 
baking soda has been dissolved. Press the cabbage down in the 
water ; let it boil slowly for about one hour. When quite tender 
take it up and lay it in a colander to drain. Press every drop of 
water out of the cabbage, chop it finely with a knife, sprinkle it with 
pepper each time you turn it; add to it i oz. butter, i tablespoonful 
lemon juice ; put it into a clean sauce-pan and stir it over the fire 
while it is quite hot again ; then put it into a vegetable dish, and 
press it gently until it is smooth ; score it a little on the top with a 
knife and serve at once. 

MEPHISTOPHELEAN TOMATOES. Just to think of it ! One pint of 
tomatoes peeled, i hard-boiled egg, the yolk only, 2 large spoon- 
fuls of melted butter, i 1-2 spoonfuls of vinegar, i raw egg whip- 
ped very light; rub in the butter and seasoning, beat till perfectly 
smooth, i teaspoonful each of sugar, salt and pepper; pound the 
boiled yolk, rub that in and beat again, stir in the vinegar boil- 
ing hot, then raw egg beaten, keep it hot (the vessel set in boil- 
ing water), while you prepare your tomatoes, cut in thin slices 
and broil over a clear fire, lay on a chafing dish and pour the 
hot sauce over them and serve. 

BAKED TOMATOES. Eight or ten tomatoes, pepper and salt, 2 
spoonfuls of butter, bread crumbs. Take off the stems from the 
tomatoes, cut them into thick slices and put them in a deep bak- 
ing dish, add a plentiful seasoning of pepper salt and butter 
in the above proportion, cover the whole with bread crumbs, drop 
over a little clarified butter, bake in a moderate oven from 20 min- 
utes to 1-2 hour, and serve very hot. This vegetable, dressed as 
above, is an exceedingly nice accompaniment to all kinds of roast 
meat. The tomatoes, instead of being cut in slices, may be baked 
whole, but they will take rather longer time to cook ; 20 minutes to 
1-2 hour. 

STEWED TOMATOES. One teacupful of bread crumbs, i table- 



VEGETABLES. 163 

spoonful of good brown sugar, a teaspoonful of pepper, a heaped 
tablespoonful of fresh butter, i dozen large tomatoes, a good sized 
onion minced. Put in a covered stew pan and cook i hour ; shake 
the pan frequently to keep from burning. Just before serving beat 
up the yolks of 2 or 3 eggs, stir them rapidly to the tomatoes, let 
them stay a few minutes and serve in a covered dish or tureen. To- 
matoes are best cooked slowly and a long time, and make a fine ac- 
companiment for all kinds of roast or baked meats or fowls. 

STEWED TOMATOES (English mode.) Eight or 10 tomatoes, 1-2 
pint of good gravy, thickening of butter and flour, cayenne and salt 
to taste. Take out the stalks of the tomatoes, put them into a wide 
stew pan, pour over them the above proportions of good brown 
gravy and stew gently until they are tender, occasionally carefully 
turning them that they may be equally done. Thicken the gravy 
with a little butter and flour worked together in a plate ; let it just 
boil up after the thickening is added and serve. Stew very gently 
for 20 to 25 minutes. 

To DRESS TRUFFLES WITH CHAMPAGNE. Twelve fine black truf- 
fles, a few slices of fat bacon, i carrot, i turnip, 2 onions, i bunch of 
savory herbs, including parsley ; i bay leaf, mint and thyme, 2 cloves, 
i blade of pounded mace, 2 glasses of champagne, 1-2 pint of stock. 
Carefully select the truffles, reject those that have a musty smell, and 
wash them well with a brush in cold water only until perfectly clean, 
put the bacon into a stew pan with the truffles and remaining ingre- 
dients. Simmer these gently for i hour and let the whole cool in a 
stew pan. When to be served re-warm them and drain them in a 
clean cloth, then arrange them on a delicate white napkin that it 
may contrast as strongly as possible with the truffles, and serve. 
The trimmings of the truffles are used to flavor the gravies, stock, 
sauces, &c., and are an excellent addition to ragouts, made dishes 
of fowl, &c. One hour for cooking. 

The wholesomeness of the truffles is questionable. Truffles are 
of different kinds and grow in clusters, and at a considerable depth 
under the earth, and never upon the surface. There is nothing to 
indicate wJiere they are, but hogs, attracted by their scent, root them 
upto*eat, as they are fond of them. Truffles are unsuitable for 
weak stomachs. They have a pleasant aroma. Their chief use 
as seasoning, when dried and reduced tp powder, form a useful 
culinary ingredient. They belong to the mushroom family. 

ITALIAN MODE OF DRESSING TRUFFLES. Ten truffles, 1-4 pint of 
salad oil, pepper and salt to taste ; i tablespoonful of minced pars- 
ley, a very little finely minced garlic, 2 blades of powdered mace, i 
tablespoonful of lemon juice. After cleaning and brushing the truf- 
fles cut them into thin slices and put them in a baking dish with a 



164 VEGETABLES. 

seasoning of oil, pepper, salt, parsley, garlic and mace in the above 
proportions. Bake them for nearly an hour, and just before serving 
add the lemon juice and send them to the table very hot. Nearly i 
hour to cook.. 

TRUFFLES AU NATURAL. Truffles, buttered paper. Select some 
fine truffles, cleanse them by washing them in separate waters 
with a brush until not a particle of sand or grit remains on them, 
wrap each truffle in a buttered paper and bake in a hot oven or 
stew pan for i hour ; take off the paper, wipe the truffles and serve 
them hot on a napkin ; i hour. 

SQUASHES. Gather them when the rind can be entered by the 
finger nail, then boil them either whole or sliced; if old, they 
should be peeled; keep them in water until the time for cooking 
them. If young and tender they will cook in 1-2 to 3-4 of an 
hour, depending on the size and age. Add salt to the water when 
boiling. Put them to cook in boiling water, cover the vessel closely. 
When tender take them up and press them between 2 plates or 
in a colander to remove the water, then mash them, and if there 
are any hard pieces take them out, wipe the stew pan dry and re- 
turn the squash, and season with cream, butter, salt and pepper to 
taste. They can be parboiled and stewed to a beautiful brown with 
slices of fat, sweet bacon, pepper and salt and a good spice of on- 
ions, or after squeezing them dry dip the slices in thin batter and fry 
them in fresh lard. Serve as fast as fried ; they should not be 
piled. 

DRYING COOKED PUMPKINS. After cutting the pumpkin in small 
pieces, stew till soft, then thoroughly mash and strain them through 
a colander; place the slrained pulp in thin layers in dishes or plates 
not quite an inch thick, dry in a moderate stove or oven, tak- 
ing care not to scorch it. It will dry in a day. Then store the 
sheets away in a dry, cool place, when they are always ready for 
pies or sauce. When used, soak them in sweet milk over night. 

GREEN TURNIPS TO COOK. Remove the tops, wash, peel and cut 
them into little billets, stew in not too much water ; when done dress 
them with cream, butter, pepper, grated nutmeg and salt to taste. 
Serve hot ; very nice. 

BOILED TURNIPS. Turnips; to each 1-2 gallon of water allow i 
heaped tablespoonful oi salt ; pare the turnips, and should they be 
large, divide them into quarters, but unless this is the case let them 
be cooked whole. After peeling them they should be washed in 
several waters, and then divide them and put them into a sauce pan 
of boiling water salted in the above proportion, and let them boil 
gently till tender. Fry them with pork, and when done take them 
in a colander or between two plates and let them drain thoroughly

and serve. Turnips are usually boiled with mutton or pork, or 
pork shins, which gives the turnips a better flavor, while the meat is 
greatly improved in taste by being cooked with them. They are 
infinitely better mashed than served whole, but some prefer them 
whole. Old turnips from 3-4 to i 1-4 hours, young ones 28 or 30 
minutes for boiling. 

MASHKD TURNIPS. Tenor 12 large turnips; to each 1-2 gallon of 
water allow i heaped tablespoonful of salt, 2 ounces of butter, cay- 
enne or white pepper to taste. Peel, wash and quarter the turnips 
and put them into boiling water, salted in the above proportion, boil 
them till tender, then drain them in a colander or between 2 plates. 
Squeeze them as dry as possible, pressing them with the back of a 
large plate. When quite free from water put them into a very clean 
sauce pan, add the butter, white pepper or cayenne, or if necessary 
a little salt. Keep stirring them over the fire until the butter is well 
mixed with them and the turnips are thoroughly hot ; dish and serve. 
A little cream or milk added after the turnips are pressed is an im- 
provement to both the color and flavor of this vegetable, and also 
pounded allspice or cloves, a very little. From 1-2 to 3-4 hour to 
boil the turnips. 10 minutes to warm them through. 

FRIED TURNIPS. --Peel, wash and slice them, put them in a stew 
pan with a small portion of water and let simmer rather quickly with 
a few slices of fat pork, pepper, pounded allspice, a bit of butter and 
a pinch of salt. When the liquor has become nearly boiled away 
thicken the gravy with a small portion of cream or milk and flour, 
and boiling hot pour it over the dish of turnips, which should be 
eaten hot. 

BACON AND CABBAGE. The cabbages in this favorite winter dish 
in the Southern States should be boiled in two waters with a little 
red pepper in them, which gives a pleasant flavor to the cabbages, 
as well as the pot-liquor, which arises from the boiling of the cab- 
bages and bacon together. The liquor should be thoroughly drained 
from the cabbages ; then take up the meat and lay the cabbages 
neatly around it. Some garnish it with hard-boiled eggs. You can 
season, when you eat it, with pepper, vinegar and salt. 

To -STUFF CABBAGES. Examine it well after cutting off the green 
leaves, wash it well and lay it in cold, clear water until ready for use. 
Take out the heart or center, leaving 2 or 3 rows of leaves. Scald 
the cabbage well, and when the leaves become soft there will be no 
danger of their breaking. Chop the heart or bud very 
fine ; then take scraps of meat, fowl, a few bread crumbs, an 
onion (if approved) chopped fine, season high with pepper, salt 
and a raw egg beaten ; work all together. Then make one large or 
several small balls and put into the center of the cabbage ; then fold

the leaves over very carefully, wrap well with threads, tie it up in thin 
muslin securely and boil until tender, or can be pierced with a straw. 
Drain it from the water, serve on a hot dish, and pour over melted 
butter after the strings and cloth are removed. 

COLD SLAW. Shave a hard, white cabbage head to the finest pos- 
sible threads with a very sharp knife or by machine. To every quart 
of cabbage take the yolks of 3 eggs, beat them well and mix with 
t 1-2 cupfuls of good cider vinegar, a tablespoonful of olive oil, i 
tablespoonful of loaf sugar, i of thick, new cream, a heaped tea- 
spoonful of white mustard, a piece of butter as large as a walnut, 
pepper and salt to taste; stir them together and put this into a 
sauce-pan ; when hot, add the cabbage, and stew for 4 or 5 minutes 
until thoroughly hot. Then raise it up with a wooden, silver or white 
metal fork. Take it up and set it away until perfectly cold, or on ice. 
The vinegar should be strong and pure, or more will be required. 

HOT SLAW. When the cabbages are tender, cook i hour ; add 
vinegar to taste. Parboil the cabbages for 10 minutes after quarter- 
ing and washing them carefully and shreding them finely, put them 
into a stew-pan, and season with pepper and salt to taste; add 1-2 
cup of water and an even tablespoonful of butter ; cover the pan and 
stew until tender; stir frequently from the bottom. 

STEWED RED CABBAGES. One red cabbage, a small slice of ham, 

1 spoonful of fresh butter, t pint of weak stock or broth, i gill of 
cider vinegar, and i tablespoonful of pounded sugar. Salt and 
pepper to taste, and ccok rather more than i hour. 

FRIED CABBAGES. Boil and chop them up, then fry them in but- 
ter or bacon grease, adding pepper and salt and a little cream or new 
milk to the gravy. Cold cabbage can be fried over for breakfast in 
the same way. 

CABBAGE STALKS. Scrape them and leave them in water all night, 
and the next day cook them like vegetable marrow. They will be 
found delicious. Season with cream or butter and pepper. 

HARICOT BEANS AND MINCED ONIONS One quart of haricot beans, 
4 middling-sized onions, 1-4 pint of good brown .gravy, pepper and 
salt to taste, and a little flour. Peel and mince the onions, but not 
too finely, and fry them a light brown color in butter ; dredge them 
over with a little flour and add the gravy and a seasoning of 
pepper and salt. Have ready a pint of minced haricot beans 
well boiled and drained; put them with the onions and gravy 
mixed all well together, and serve very hot. Boil the beans for 

2 or 2 1-2 hours; 5 minutes to fry the onions. 

DRIED WHITE BEANS. Wash i quart of dried white beans, and 
put them in a stew-pan with 3 quarts of cold water, a table- 
spoonful of salt; set on the fire, and when boiling put them to 



VEGETABLES. 167 

simmer in the closed stew-pan on the stove corner until tender ; 
drain and put them back in the stew-pan with i oz. butter, i table- 
spoonful of chopped parsley, 2 pinches of salt, i small pinch of 
pepper, 1-2 gill of the liquor of the beans; toss the beans until the 
butter is melted, and serve. Haricot or French beans are also served 
as a salad. Let them get cold, put them in a salad bowl, season with 
oil or butter, vinegar, pepper and salt and a tablespoonful of celery 
chopped fine. 

BOILED CAULIFLOWER. To each 1-2 gallon of water allow one 
heaped tablespoonful of salt. Choose cauliflowers that are close 
and white, trim off the decayed outside leaves and cut the stalk 
flat at the bottom, open the flower a little in places to remove 
the insects, which generally are found about the stalk, and let 
the cauliflowers lie in salt and water for an hour previous to 
dressing them, with their heads downward ; this will effectually 
draw out all the vermin ; then put them in fast-boiling water, with 
the addition of salt in the above proportion, and let them boil briskly 
on a good fire, keeping the sauce-pan uncovered. The water should 
be well skimmed, and when the cauliflowers are tender take them 
up with a slice or perforated ladle, and let them drain, and, if large 
enough, place them upright in the dish. Serve with plain, melted 
butter, a little of which may be poured over the flower. Small caul- 
iflower, 12 to 15 minutes; large one, 20 to 25 minutes after the 
water boils. 

CAULIFLOWERS WITH CHEESE 2 or 3 cauliflowers, rather more than 
1-2 pint of broth or white sauce, 2 tablespoonfuls of grated cheese, 
i spoonful of fresh butter, and 2 tablespoonfuls bread crumbs 
clean and boil the cauliflowers (as in recipe for boiled artichokes), 
drain and dish them with the flowers standing upright ; have ready 
the above proportion of white sauce ; pour sufficient of it over the 
cauliflower to just cover the top; sprinkle over this some rasped 
cheese and bread crumbs, and drop on these the butter, which should 
be melted, but not oiled. Brown with a salamander or before the 
fire, and pour not over, but around the flowers the remainder of the 
sauce, with which should be mixed a small quantity of grated cheese. 
Cook 1-2 hour. Cauliflower is cooked in every way, like cabbage. 

To BOIL CAULIFLOWER (Mrs. Sicklan). If the flower is small 
and tender, put it in boiling water and boil 20 minutes or a shorter 
time. If the head is large, old and tough, boil for 30 minutes or a 
little longer, putting it at first in a kettle of boiling water. Serve 
hot, with butter or Tillie's sauce for cauliflowers. The water should 
be salted. Some boil it in a bag to prevent it breaking off the small 
sprigs. 

BOILED ONIONS. In clear water and salt until tender, then take 



l68 VEGETABLES. 

them up and serve in a deep dish with melted butter, pepper and 
salt. 

RAW ONIONS Cut up in vinegar, pepper, salt and sugar, make a fine 
relish for any kind of meat. 

BAKED ONIONS. 4 or 5 onions, salt and water. Put the onions 
with their skins on into a sauce-pan of boiling water slightly salted, 
and let them boil quickly for i hour. Take them out, wipe them 
thoroughly, wrap each one in a piece of paper separately, and bake 
them in a moderate oven for 2 hours, or longer, should the onions 
be very large. They may be served in their skins and eaten with a 
piece of cold butter and a seasoning of pepper and salt, or they 
may be peeled and a good brown gravy poured over them. Boil i 
hour ; bake 2 hours. 

STEWED ONIONS. 5 or 6 onions, i pint of brolh or gravy. Peel 
the onions, taking care not to cut away too much of the tops or tails, 
or they would then fall to pieces ; put them into a ste\v-pan capable 
of holding them at the bottom without piling one on the top of the 
other; add the brother gravy and simmer very gently until the 
onions are perfectly tender, dish them and pour the gravy around, 
and serve. Instead of using broth, onions may be stewed with a 
large piece of butter. They must be done very gradually over a 
slow fire or hot plate, and will produce plenty of gravy. To stew in 
gravy, 2 hours, or longer, if very large. 

BURNT ONIONS FOR GRAVIES. 1-2 Ib. onion, 1-2 pint water, 1-2 
Ib. moist sugar, 1-3 pint cider vinegar. Peel and chop the onions 
fine and put them into a (not tinned) stew-pan with the water; let 
them boil for 5 minutes, then add the sugar and simmer gently until 
the mixture becomes nearly black and throws out bubbles of smoke. 
Have ready the above proportion of boiling vinegar, strain the liquor 
gradually to it, and keep stirring with a wooden spoon until it is well 
incorporated, and when cold, bottle for use. With many the onion 
is a very great favorite, and is considered highly nutritive. It is 
thought to have come originally from India, through Egypt, where 
it became an' object of worship, and thence transmitted over the 
world. 

ONIONS ARE FRIED in butter or bacon grease after chopping them 
up. 

ONIONS IN CELLARS (Dr. Goot's Monthly). Half dozen onions 
planted in the cellar, where they get even a little light, will do much 
toward absorbing and correcting the atmospheric impurities that are 
apt to lurk in such places. 

A GOOD WAY TO COOK ONIONS. Peel i dozen onions, put them 
in a kettle with water enough to cover them ; add a tablespoonful of 
salt, put them on the fire and boil until well done, but so you can

take them up whole with a fork, pour off the water, add 2 table- 
spoonfuls of butter and 1-2 cup of cream, salt and pepper to taste. 

To STEW GREEN CORN. After the corn has been cut from the 
cobs with a sharp knife, put it into a stew-pan, then with the back 
of the knife run over the cob, to obtain the remaining juice, hold- 
ing it over the pan ; to each quart of corn, add 1-2 cup of water. 
Stew from 1-2 to 3-4 hour, or until done, governed by the age 
and kind of corn. When done, season with pepper and salt to 
taste. Another way: With a sharp knife cut the grains of corn 
from the cob, into a frying-pan, allowing i cup of water to i 
quart of corn. It should be stirred frequently. Cook 1-2 hour. 
Season to taste with pepper and salt, add a small piece of butter or 
sweet lard, and fry a light brown color. 

To DRESS CORN. When the silks or beards of the corn become 
of almost a black brown, the grains are perfect and full of milk, 
and not too hard. Commence by pulling off the silk and then 
the husks (or shucks), then carefully pick off all the silks that 
remain, after rubbing the ear of corn (or roasting ear) round in 
a cloth held in the hand. Then put the corn in boiling water 
with a little salt in it. If the corn is young, cook 1-2 hour. Cut 
the corn from the cobs with a sharp knife ; put it into a covered 
deep dish. Season with pepper, salt and butter, or serve the 
ears hot as they are boiled. Sugar corn is best for table use. 

GREEN CORN PUDDING. Three well beaten eggs, 3 cups of 
green corn, i cup of milk, 2 tablespoonfuls butter, and pepper 
and salt to taste. Bake. 

GRKEN CORN PUDDING WITH TOMATOES. Leave the grains as 
whole as possible when trimming them down with a knife from the 
ear, then scrape the cob to get all the milk. Then beat up 4 eggs 
wiih a quart of milk, i quart of the rasped corn, and then add i pint 
of tomatoes that have been stewed with sugar. Season with butter, 
pepper and salt. Stir it well until thoroughly mixed and smooth. 
Boil it in a pudding cloth. It is best to rasp the corn on a regular tin 
corn-grater for puddings, etc. 

BAKED CORN. Take 6 large ears of green corn or 12 ears of su- 
gar corn, cut the grains off and scrape the cob; add 1-2 cupful of 
butter, i tablespoonful nice sugar and a teaspoonful of salt. Rub 
these well together and add 2 cups of new sweet milk. Bake in a 
dish that you may set on the table without disturbing it 

BOILED PEAS. Put 2 quarts of water with 1-4 oz. of salt into 
a 3-quart stew-pan on the fire ; when it boils pour in a quart of fresh 
shelled peas, boil quickly, and when done drain and put them in a 
sauce pan with 3 oz. of butter ; sprinkle with a little salt ; toss them 
untill the butter is melted, and serve.

and skim the pot. 

I WITH BACON (Managero). Put 2 pints of well- 
boiled shelled peas into a stew-pan with 5 spoonfuls of brown sauce, 
a of brown gravy, a teaspoonful of sugar. ; button onions and a 
bunch of parsley ; let it boil 5 minutes ; have ready-braised 4 OK, of

throw the peas into boiling water, drain and season as you would 
fresh ; 

PAKSXIPS. Clean the parsnips, put them on the fire with soup 
stock and let them boil till done, then mix some pounded crao\ 
and - I with the broth in which the parsnips h. 

Boiled and let them boil a few minutes longer. 

BOILKD PARSNIPS. To each 1-2 gallon of water allow i he 
teaspoonful of salt. Wash the parsnips. them thor- 

oughly, and with the point of the knife remove any blac'x 
about them, and should they be ve: at the thick part into 

quarters, put them into a sauce pan of boiling water salted the a! 
proportion; boil them rapidly till tender, which may be ascertained 
by thrusting a fork in them; take them up, drain them and serve in 
a vegetable d;sh. Ti i^le is usually served with salt fish, 

boiled pork or boiled beef; when sent to the table with the latter a 
few should be placed alternately with carrots around the dish as a 
garnish. Large parsnips i to i 1-2 hours; small ones 1-2 to i 
hour. This vegetable is found wild all over Europe and England, 



VEGKTAKJ.KS. 

and an excellent wine is made from it By some the parsnip is con- 

<:d unwholesome. 

li'jii.i'jj BKKT ROOT. Beet root, boiling water; when young and 
juicy this vegetable makes a most excellent dish, and may be easily 
converted into pickle by dropping them into spiced vinegar. They 
are eaten hot or cold ; if eaten hot melted butter should be poured 
over them. They may be stewed with button onions or boiled, and 
served with roasted onions. Wash the beets thoroughly, but do not 
break the skin, as the juice will run out and spoil their beautiful color 
in boiling. Then put them into boiling water with a little salt in it 
.uul boil till tender, keeping them well covered. If to be served hot, 
remove the peel quickly, cut the beet in thick slices and send to 
table with melted butter. By. putting the beet in cold water the 
skins slip off easily. For salad, pickles, &c., let the root cool, then 
peel and cut into slices. The turnip and sugar beet are of all col- 
ors, are always sweet and delicious, no matter how large. They grow 
wild in temperate and semi-tropical climates. Boil small beet root 

1 1-2 hours; large 2 1-2 to 3 hours. 

BOM.KU TUHNJP GREENS. To each 1-2 gallon of water allow 
one heaped tablespoonful of salt. Wash the greens well in 

2 or 3 waters, pick off all the decayed and dead leaves, tie them 
in .Mi.ul bunches or simply put them into plenty of boiling water 
suited in the above proportion, keep th -m boiling quick with the lid 
of the vessels removed, and when tender dip them up with a per- 
forated ladle and then remove the strings with which they are tied 
and serve. Boil for 15 minutes or longer. It is very good boiled 
with fresh corned pork. 

To BOIL YOUNG GREENS OR SPROUTS. To each 1-2 gallon of 
water allow i heaped tablespoonful of salt, a very small piece of 
soda. Pick away all the dead leaves and wash the greens well 
in cold water, drain them in a colander and put them into fast 
boiling water with salt and soda in the above proportion ; keep 
them boiling quickly with the lid removed till tender, and the 
moment they are done take them up, or their color will be spoiled. 
When well drained, serve. The great art in cooking greens prop- 
erly, and to have a good color, is to put them in plenty of fast- 
boiling water to let them boil very quickly, and to take them up 
the moment they become tender. Broccoli sprouts from ten to 12 
minutes; young greens 10 to 12 minutes after they boil. 

NASTURTIUMS. The bright glowing flowers which seem to turn as 
they glow with beauty, while hanging over the partly colored rotund 
leaves of dapple green and white, the pride of the California gar- 
dens, make a fine relish of delicate mustard flavor when eaten with 
any kind of cold meat, and with loaf bread and butter. They make 



172 VEGETABLES. 

a handsome garnish and a beautiful breakfast dish. They should be 
washed before using, but handled delicately. The pods also are 
good and make excellent pickle, and are a fine substitute for capers 
in making sauce. 

BOILED SEA KALE To each 1-2 gallon of water allow i table- 
spoonful of salt ; wash the kale well and cut away the worm-eaten 
pieces and tie it into small bunches, or throw it loosely into boiling 
water salted in the above proportion ; take it out, drain, untie the 
bunches, or dip it up with a perforated ladle and serve with plain 
butter or cream, which should be hot, and poured over. Sea kale 
may be parboiled and stewed in brown gravy. It will then take about 
1-2 hour altogether. Boil 15 or 20 minutes. Different kinds of salads 
may be boiled together. 

To DRESS CUCUMBKRS, Three tablespoonfuls of salad oil, 4 ta- 
blespoonfuls of good cider vinegar, salt and pepper to taste. Let 
the cucumbers be gathered early in the morning while the dew is on 
them, and then drop them into cold water and kept in a cool, damp 
place, then have ready a bowl of cool, clean water, pare the cucum- 
bers and drop them in the water ; when done, draw the water off 
and put in a supply of fresh, then cut the cucumbers up in thin, round 
slices until reaching the bitter end, which should be rejected ; then 
pour cold' water on the cucumbers several times, then put them in 
a cold dish, then pour the vinegar over them first, then the oil, then 
pepper and salt and put them in the refrigerator or in a cool vessel 
with water in it. This can be eaten with anything and at any meal. 
If the salt is added before the vinegar it will cause the fruit to wilt. 
Cucumbers should have 1-3 onions cut up with them to have them 
in perfection, and if they can be set on ice it is best to cut them up 
in the morning in a bowl of water and set them on the ice until 
about to be used, then pour the water off and season with vinegar, 
&c The oil can be left out if desired. 

STEWED CUCUMBERS. Three large cucumbers, flour, butter, rather 
more than i pint of good gravy ; cut the cucumbers lengthwise the 
size of the dish they are to be served in ; empty them of their seeds 
and put them into boiling water with a little salt and let them sim- 
mer for 5 minutes, then take them out, place them in another stew 
pan with the gravy and let them boil over a brisk fire until they 
are done. Should these be bitter add a lump of sugar, carefully 
dish them, skim the sauce, pour over the cucumbers and serve ; cook 
20 minutes. 

CUCUMBKRS A LA POULETTE. Take 2 or 3 middle-sized cucum- 
bers, salt, vinegar, i spoonful of butter, flour, 1-2 pint of broth, i 
teaspoonful of minced parsley, a lump of sugar, the yolks of 2 eggs, 
pepper and salt to taste. Pare and cut the cucumbers into slices of 



VEGETABLES. 173 

an equal thickness, 2 inches in length, i inch thick, and let them re- 
main in the salt and vinegar for 1-2 hour, then drain them in a cloth 
and put them in the stew pan with the butter; fry them over a brisk 
fire but do not brown them, and then dredge over them a little flour. 
Add the broth, skim off all the fat, which will rise to the surface, and 
boil gently until the gravy is somewhat reduced ; stir in the yolks of 
the eggs, add the parsley, sugar and the seasoning of pepper and 
salt, and bring the whole to a boiling point and serve. Or, the cu- 
cumber can be stewed in 2 quarts of water with i oz. of butter, 2 
pinches of salt. Simmer till tender, which can be ascertained by 
pressing them ; if done it will enter easily. Drain on a cloth, make 
a pint of poulette sauce, put the cucumber in it and serve. 

OKRA AND TOMATOES. Take an equal quantity of each, slice the 
okra and skin the tomatoes, add a little chopped onion and a little 
sugar, seasoned with salt and pepper. Use no water, but stew for 
45 minutes ; to each quart of the mixture add a piece of butter as 
large as a walnut ; and then put in the stew pan. Take care that it 
does not burn. 

STEWED ENDIVES. Six heads of endives, salt and water, i pint 
of broth, thickening of butter and flour, i tablespoonful of lemon 
juice, a small lump of sugar. Wash and free the endive thor- 
oughly from insects, remove the green part of the leaves and put 
i: into boiling water slightly salted. Let it remain for 10 minutes, 
take it out, drain it till there is no water remaining, and chop it very 
fine. Put it into the stew pan with the broth, add a little salt and a 
lump of sugar, and boil until the endive is perfectly tender. When 
done, which may be ascertained by squeezing a piece between the 
thumb and finger, add a thickening of butter and flour, and lemon 
juice ; let the sauce boil up and serve. 

ENDIVE A LA FRANCAISK. Six heads of endive, i pint of broth, 3 
ounces of fresh butter, salt, pepper and grated nutmeg to taste. 
Wash and boil the endive as in the preceding recipe, chop it rather 
fine and put it into a stew pan with the broth ; boil over a brisk fire 
until the sauce is all reduced, then put in the butter, pepper, salt and 
grated nutmeg (the last must be very sparingly used); mix all to- 
gether, bring it to the boiling point and serve very hot; 10 minutes 
to boil, 5 to simmer in the broth. 

SHALLOTS. Remove the outside skin and cut off the green part, 
unless very tender, then chop up the root and a little of the green 
part, joining the root, then put them in a frying pan in cold water ; 
when the water is on the eve of boiling pour it off, add a few slices 
of sweet bacon or pork and fry them, turning them often ; or boil 
the bulbs in salted water and serve with melted butter, pepper and a 
little salt. Some persons eat them raw with vinegar, pepper and salt,

or serve with lettuce, radishes and water cresses, and are often used 
in the place of onions. 

This plant, it is supposed, was brought from Ascalon by the cru- 
saders, who found it growing wild in the vicinity of that ancient and 
renowned city. It is an excellent condiment in pickles, sauces, soups, 
&c., &c., called by old authors the "barren onion." 

THE LEEK is the national badge of the Welsh, and is widely dif- 
fused over the earth as an edible, and was bewailed with the cucum- 
ber in the journey through the desert. It is the most delicate of the 
onion tribe. 

THE LEEK. When used the skin should be removed, then lay 
them in cold water an hour ; boil in salted water until tender ; serve 
them in a hot covered dish with melted butter, pepper and salt. 

HULLED CORN (F. S. P.) Take 3 quarts corn, 3 quarts un- 
leached wood ashes or 1-4 pound potash ; to ashes or potash add 6 
quarts of water, which boil, then strain into kettle, put in the 
corn, boil until skins break from kernels easily, stirring frequently; 
skim out the corn, rinse it several times, rubbing thoroughly the last 
time; leave it to soak in clear water 10 minutes, when rub off black 
chits ; rinse again, put back into kettle, cover with water, boil slowly 
till soft; keep hot water to add until boiled tender. When cold eat 
with plain cream or milk, or cream and sugar. 

BOILED HOMINY. (E. L. M.) Boiled; soak i cup of hominy in 
3 cups of water with salt to taste. In the morning turn it into a tin 
quart pail, then put the pail or tin bucket in a kettle of boiling water, 
cover tightly and steam i hour, then add i teacup of sweet milk and 
boil 15 minutes after stirring the milk in. 

LYK HOMINY. To i gallon of shelled Indian corn add i quart of 
strong lye of wood ashes. Boil until the grains begin to swell and 
the husks begin to come off the corn. Rub until the husk is entirely- 
removed with the hands, wash it well and boil in plenty of water un- 
til the grains are soft. It requires long boiling, and should be re- 
plenished with hot water instead of cold. When nearly done, boil ; 
add salt sufficiently to season. To prevent its burning when nearly 
done stir it from the bottom. It may be beaten slightly with a 
wooden mallet before using it, and fry in a small quantity of sweet 
lard or butter. Take up in a wooden bowl or earthen jar. Both 
should be covered. In cold weather it will keep several days. It is 
one of the best of Southern dishes. 

FRIED MUSH. Make a moderately thin mush, pour it thinly over 
a large, flat dish. When perfectly cold sprinkle a little flour over the 
top ; slice it with a knife as for a pie. Have a pan of hot lard and 
lay it in carefully, and when perfectly brown turn it over and brown the 
other side. This excellent dish, or the mush, may be poured in a 
pan to mould it

To BOIL LETTUCE. Wash clean, boil it in soft salt and water, then 
put it into cold water to cool. Chop it in the same manner as spin- 
ach, and finish as spinach with this exception : you bind it with the 
yolks of a few eggs stirred into some cream. Endives can be pre- 
pared in the same way. 

CABBAGE LETTUCE WITH GRAVY. Take 8 sound and full cabbage 
lettuce, trim off all the outside leaves, wash and blanch for 10 min- 
utes, cool them well, squeeze the water out, cut them in two, lay 
them open on a dish, and season them with 3 pinches of salt, tie the 
halves together and put in a 2-quart stew pan, cover them with broth 
and add 2 gills of fat pot stock, parsley, thyme and mint and i on- 
ion with 2 cloves stuck in it; place a round of paper on the top and 
simmer for 2 hours When cooked drain on a cloth, untie and open 
the lettuce again, cut the stalks out and fold the leaves round, giv- 
ing to each piece an oval shape about 3 inches by 2, and dish them 
up in a circle; reduce to i 1-2 pint of household gravy to 1-2 the 
quantity, and pour over the lettuce and serve. Thin slices of 
crumbed bread cut to the shape of lettuces and fried in butter can 
be put between each slice. 

BOILED VEGETABLE MARROW. To each 1-2 gallon of water allow 
i tablespoonful of salt ; vegetable marrow. Have ready a sauce 
pan of boiling water salted in the above proportions, put in the 
marrows after peeling them, and boil them until tender, take them 
up with a slice and halve, and should they be very large quarter 
them ; dish them on toast and send to table with them a tureen 
of melted butter, or in the place of this a small ball of salt but- 
ter. Vegetable marrows are very delicious mashed ; they should 
be boiled, then drained and mashed smoothly with a wooden spoon. 
Heat them in a sauce pan, add a seasoning of salt and pepper and 
a small piece of butter, and dish with a few sippets of toasted bread 
placed around as a garnish. Young vegetable marrows 10 to 20 
minutes; old ones 1-2 to 3-4 hour for cooking. 

VEGETABLE MARROWS IN WHITE SAUCE. Four or 5 moderate- 
sized marrows, 1-4 pint of white sauce. Pare the marrows, cut them 
into halves and shape each half at the top in a point, leaving the 
bottom end flat for it to stand upright in the dish. Boil the marrows 
in salt and water until tender, take them away very carefully and ar- 
range them on a hot dish; have ready 1-2 pint of white sauce, pour 
this over the marrows and serve. This vegetable cooks from 15 
to 20 minutes, and belongs to the cucumber or melon tribe. 

PUMPKIN. Open the pumpkin, take out the seeds, slice and peel 
the rind off, or peel before slicing ; do not scrape the inside, cut it 
in small pieces, put them to stew in a covered vessel with very little 
water. To prevent their burning stir them often from the bottom.

In cool weather a good deal may be cooked at a time and kept in a 
cool, dry place in a tin or an earthen vessel. Fry with a little sweet 
lard or dress with butter, a little sugar and ginger, or mix with milk or 
cream, eggs, and spices for making puddings or custards. They can 
be dried aiso as apples for any of the above purposes, and are found 
excellent. This will do in very cold winters, where the pumpkin 
cannot be kept from freezing. 

CASHEW AND DAINTY SQUASH Cut them in two, remove the seed, 
and bake them with the rind on. Scrape out the inside or eat the 
flesh on the rind ; season with butter, pepper, salt or a little mace, or 
it may be eaten with cream or milk as a dessert. 

BAKED PUMPKINS. Take a hard-shelled or potato pumpkin, slice 
or divide them in 2 or 4 pieces. Serve with butter and salt in a dish. 
Eaten hot or cold. 

VERY THIN MASHED POTATOES. To every Ib. of mashed pota- 
toes allow 1-2 pint of good broth or stock and a large spoonful of 
fresh butter. Boil the potatoes, drain them well and mash them 
smoothly with a fork ; add the stock or broth and rub the potatoes 
through a sieve, put the mixture into a sauce-pan with the butter, 
stir it over the fire until thoroughly hot, and it will be ready to serve. 
This mixture should be rather thinner than mashed potatoes, and is 
a delicious accompaniment to delicately broiled mutton cutlets. 
Cream or milk may be substituted for the broth when it is not at hand. 
A casserole of potatoes, which is often used for ragouts instead of 
rice, is made by mashing potatoes rather thickly, placing them on a 
dish and making an opening in the center. After having browned 
the potatoes in the oven, the dish should be wiped clean and the 
ragout or fricassee poured in. Half hour to boil the potatoes ; 6 or 
7 minutes to warm the puree. 

POTATO RISSOLE. Mashed potatoes, salt and pepper to taste ; 
when liked, a very little minced parsley, eggs and bread crumbs. 
Boil and mash the potatoes as in recipe for mashed potatoes ; 
add a seasoning of pepper and salt, and when liked a little 
minced parsley. Roll the potatoes into small balls, cover them 
with egg and bread crumbs, and fry them in hot lard for 10 
minutes ; let them drain before the fire, dish plain and serve. 
Ten minutes to fry rissoles. 

N. B. The flavor of these rissoles may be very much in- 
creased by adding finely-minced tongue or ham, or chopped on- 
ions, when liked, or minced codfish is good. 

POTATOES, as an esculent for the human family, rank next in 
value to wheat, and it has been demonstrated that an acre of 
potatoes will feed double the number of persons that an acre of 
wheat will. 



VEGETABLES. 

POTATO SNOW. Potatoes, salt and water. Choose large, white 
potatoes, as free from spots as possible ; boil them in their skins 
in salt and water until perfectly tender; drain and dry them 
thoroughly by the fire, and peel them. Put a hot dish before 
the fire, rub ihe potatoes through a coarse sieve on to this dish. 
Do not touch them afterwards, or the flakes will fall, and serve 
as hot as possible. Half to three-quarters of an hour to boil 
the potatoes. 

COLCANNON (An Irish dish). Boil in vessels equal quanti- 
ties of potatoes and cabbages: when the former are fit to peel take 
off the j ickets and mix the two together in a sauce-pan, after pour- 
ing off the cabbage liquor, then beat them up together and add an 
oz. of lard or drippings to each pound of potatoes. Season with 
pepper and salt, and add to the cabbage an onion or two. 

BAKED POTATOES. Choose large potatoes, as much of a size as 
possible ; wash them in lukewarm water, scrub them well, for the 
browned skin of a baked potato by many persons is considered the 
better part of it, as it contains more of the genuine flour. Put them 
in a moderate oven and bake them tor 2 hours, turning them 3 or 4 
times whilst they are baking. Serve on a napkin immediately after 
they are dune, for, if they are kept a long time in the oven or stove, 
they will have a shriveled appearance. Potatoes may be roasted 
before the fire or in the ashes. Eat them with cold butter. Large 
potatoes in a hot oven, i 1-4 hours to 2 hours or 2 1-2 hours. 

How TO USE COLD POTATOES. To every pound of cold potatoes 
allow 2 tablespoonfuls of flour, 2 of onion chopped fine, i spoonful 
of butter, milk or cream. Mash the potatoes with a kitchen fork 
until perfectly free from lumps : stir in the other ingredients, add 
sufficient milk to moisten them well, press the potatoes in a mould 
and bake in a moderate oven until nicely brown, which will be 
from 20 to 30 minutes. Bread may be made of the potato by mix- 
ing a small portion of flour with it. In Scotland, cold potatoes are 
often squeezed up and mixed with flour or oat meal, and an excellent 
cake or sconce obtained. 

MASHED POTATOES. To every pound of mashed potatoes allow 
i oz. of butter, 2 tablespoonfuls of sweet milk or cream, and salt 
and pepper to taste. Boil the potatoes in their skins; when done, 
drain them, and let them get thoroughly dry before the fire, by the 
side of the fire or in a cold stove; then peel them, and as they are 
peeled, put them into a clean sauce-pan, and with a large fork beat 
them to a light paste ; add butter, milk and salt in the above pn- 
portion, and stir all the ingredients well over the fire ; when thoroughly 
hot, dish them lightly, and draw the fork backwards over the pota- 
toes to make the surface rough, and serve. When dressed in this

manner, they may be browned on top with a salamander or before 
the fire. Some cooks press the potatoes into moulds, then turn 
them out and brown them in the oven ; this is a pretty mode of 
serving, but it makes them heavy. In whatever way they are sent 
to table care must be taken to have them free from lumps. From 
1-2 to 3-4 hour to boil the potatoes. 

MOCK POTATOES. Boil a number of small potatoes, squeeze 
them in a cloth to dry them, then peel and mash them while 
hot to free them from lumps; then press them with the hands into 
the form of potatoes, put a cloth over them to keep them from 
browning, and put them a moment in a stove before serving, then 
send them hot pouring melted butter over them to table. No one 
could detect them from the true potato ; so you can have them as 
large or as small and as uniform as you may wish. They are beau- 
tiful when served. 

CHINESE WAY OF COOKING RICE. Take a clean stew-pan with a 
closely-fitting top, then take a clean piece of white muslin large 
enough to cover over the top of the pan and hang down inside nearly 
to, but not in contact, with the bottom. Into the sack so formed 
place the rice, pour over 2 cupfuls water, and put over the top of the 
stew-pan, so as to hold up the muslin inside, and fit tightly all around. 
Place the pan over a slow fire, and the steam generated from the 
water will cook the rice. Each grain, it is stated, will come out ol 
the boiler as dry and distinct as if just taken from the hull. More 
water may be poured into the pan if necessary, but only sufficient to 
keep up the steam until the rice is cooked. The pan must not be so 
hot as to cause the steam to throw off the lid. 

SPINACH. Pick, wash, blanch and chop 2 Ibs. of spinach ; 
put in a 3-quart stew-pan i oz. of butter, 3-4 oz. of flour and i 
pinch of salt; stir over the fire for 3 minutes; put in the spinach 
and stir well for 5 minutes ; moisten with i gill of broth and stir 
2 minutes ; then add 2 more gills of broth, stirring for five min- 
utes more. Take the spinach from the fire, add i oz. butter ; stir 
until it is well melted and mixed ; put the spinach on a dish ; 
then take a slice of bread 1-2 inch thick, cut in i 1-2 inch triangu- 
lar pieces; melt i oz. of butter in a small stew-pan; skirn it when 
melted; put in the pieces of bread, fry and toss them until of 
alight brown color; drain and place them around the spinach, 
and serve. Milk may be used instead of broth, in the proportion 
of spinach. Garnish with nasturtium leaves, flowers and buds. 

SPINACH WITH SUGAR. The spinach is prepared as above, using 
milk instead of broth, and adding 1-2 oz. of pounded sugar. 

SPINACH PLAINLY DRESSED. Boil for 1-2 hour in clear water ; put 
a small lump of soda or saleratus in the water if you wish it a beau-

tiful green. Drain it well, dish and place on the top of it pepper, 
butter and poached eggs. It can be boiled with bacon. 

SPINACH. Boil in the above manner and fry toast in three-cor- 
nered pieces. Stick over it and lay poached eggs thereon. 

STEWED OKRA. Wash according to the directions given, cut them 
in round slices and put them in a stew pan with a tablespoonful 
of butter into which has been rubbed a teaspoonful of fine flour ; 
to each quart of okra add 1-2 cup of water ; salt and pepper to 
taste. Cover the stew pan and shake it now and then, and stew 
till tender. Serve hot in a covered dish. A few tomatoes and a 
little onion to okra make a great improvement. It is an excellent 
sauce for boiled rice. 

BAKED SWEET OR IRISH POTATOES WHOLE. Put some sticks 
across the bottom of your oven or baking pan, wash your pota- 
toes thoroughly and lay them on the sticks, pour in 1-2 cup of 
water or more, then bake until done. 

BAKED IRISH POTATOES. Take your potatoes, after they are 
boiled, and mash them while hot, then put sweet cream or new 
milk, pepper and salt, and some butter with them, and an egg ; 
knead the mixture thoroughly, and then put it in a pan with a piece 
of butter on the top and bake. It is a nice dish. Sweet potatoes 
can be treated in the same way. 

FRIED SWEET POTATOES. Boil them till 1-2 done, take them up 
and let them cool, then slice and flour the pieces both sides and 
drop them in a pan of hot sweet bacon fat and fry till of a light 
brown, when dish and serve hot. 

FRIED POTATOES WITH BUTTER. While in the colander, and 
just having been fried, add to a portion of potatoes about i spoon- 
ful of butter ; toast till melted and serve plain as round steak. 

FRIED POTATOES WITH CAYENNB PEPPER. When just done throw 
1-2 teaspoonful of cayenne over them ; toast and serve them. 

FRIED CHIPPED OR RIBBONED POTATOES. Cut some potatoes 
crosswise about the thickness of an inch, then peel them thinly in 
ribbons and fry as above. They will require a little longer doing. 
When they are crisp take them out, place them on a clean cloth, 
and sprinkle them over with salt, cayenne and black pepper to taste, 
and serve. 

To FRY SWEET POTATOES. Wash and slice them very thick, put 
into a frying pan, put butter and sugar between each layer, then pour 
or cover with water and set on the fire to fry, turning them the usual 
way. 

NOTE Put butter in the pan and let it get hot before adding the 
potatoes, with the pan off the fire. 

To BOIL POTATOES. Boil 10 or any number of potatoes, to each 



l8o VEGETABLES. 

1-2 gallon of water allow i heaped tablespoonful of salt. GVOM: 
potatoes of equal size for this: the Utah potatoes are the best ; peel 
them, take out ail the eyes and specks, and as they are peeled throw 
them into cold water, just enough to cover them, with salt in the 
above proportion, and let them boil gently till tender; ascertain 
when they are done by thrusting a fork in them, and take up the 
moment they feel soft through, for if they are left in the water after- 
wards they become waxy or watery. Drain away the water, put the 
sauce pan by the side of the fire with the lid partially uncovered to 
allow the steam to escape, and let the potatoes get thoroughly dry, 
and do not allow them to get burnt. Their superfluous moisture will 
evaporate, and the potatoes, if of a good sort, should be perfectly 
mealy and dry. Potatoes vary so much in quality and size that it is 
difficult to give the exact time for boiling; they should be atten 
lively watched and probed with a fork to ascertain when they are 
cooked. Send them to the table quickly and very hot, and with an 
opening in the cover of the dish, that a portion of the steam may 
evaporate, and not fall back on the potatoes. Utah and moderate- 
sized old potatoes 15 to 20 minutes after the water boils; large ones 
from 1-2 hour to 35 minutes. Seasonable all the year round, but the 
new potatoes are the best. To keep them hot after draining them, 
have cloth for the purpose (either flannel or cotton), fold it and put 
it on the top of them, keep the sauce pan lid partially uncovered. 
This will absorb the moisture and keep them hot without spoiling. 
In Ireland they are boiled with the skins on them, and are best sent 
to the table so ; but they should be thoroughly washed and rubbed 
with a brush or coarse cloth before you cook them. 

To STEAM POTATOES. Pare them and throw them into cold wa- 
ter as they are peeled, then put them into a steamer, place the steamer 
over a sauce pan of boiling water and steam the potatoes from 20 
to 40 minutes, according to the size and sort ; when a fork goes 
easily through them they are done, then take them up, dish, and 
serve very quickly; 20 to 40 minutes; 2 large potatoes to each per- 
son. 

To Boiu OLD POTATOES. Small and large potatoes should not be 
put to cook at the same time; common sense would suggest this. 
Boil old potatoes by the foregoing receipt; Have a coarse cloth 
ready, and as each potato is lifted from the kettle squeeze it in a cor- 
ner of the cloth, slip the skin off, and they will be dry and beauti- 
fully mealy. Serve with melted butter on a hot dish. Old pota- 
toes are good baked with their skin on and served with cold but- 
ter. 

SWEET POTATO BALLS. First boil the potatoes, then carefully 
mash the farinaceous part. Boil in the meantime 2 cups of milk, 



VEGETABLES. l8l 

put in some lemon peel, a couple of lumps of sugar and a little 
salt. When the milk boils take it off the fire and add the pota- 
toes, so as to form a paste, or rather a tolerably thick mush. 
When cool make it into balls, cover these with crumbs of bread 
and yolk of egg ; fry to a nice brown color and serve up with 
sugar thrown over them. 

To COOK SWKET POTATOES OF IRISH POTATOES. Steam them 
well and mash till no lumps are left and sweeten with common 
brown sugar ; then bake or fry, or make into a pudding. 

To FRY Swh.ET POTATOES. Pare, slice them, fry them in hot 
lard like fritters and sprinkle them with fine salt as they are taken 
from the lard 

To BAKE SWEET POTATOES. Wash them clean and wipe them 
with a clean cloth, then cut off the ends, put them in an oven 
or stove pan, bake slowly, put a cupful of hot water over every 
peck of potatoes before cooking them, put some cabbage leaves 
over the potatoes before putting on the lid, if baked in an oven. 
This will prevent their burning, then put fire on the lid ; when 
done serve with their peels on, or if peeled and sliced put a layer 
on the bottom of the dish, then some bits of butter, a little sugar, 
a little grated nutmeg or cinnamon, then another layer of pota- 
toes, and seasoning until the dish is filled. Set it in the oven or 
stove until hot and serve. This is excellent for a tea dish. 

To ROAST SWKKT POTATOES. Open the ashes on a hot hearth, 
sweep it and put in the potatoes, then put on some cold, then hot 
ashes, let them remain till done. It is best to turn them over and re- 
cover them for a moment in order to cook them thoroughly, and Irish 
potatoes should be done in the same way. 

T STEW SWEET POTATOES. Slice them or cut in rings 1-2 inch 
thick, then put in pieces of tender liver or pork chops. When 
done take them all up together, season the gravy with milk or cream, 
a little finely minced parsley, salt and pepper to taste. Potatoes are 
liked peeled and roasted under meat. They should be cut under 
medium size for this purpose. _ 

POTATOES A LA MAITRE DE HOTEL, Potatoes, salt and water; to 
every 6 potatoes allow i tablespoonful of minced parsley, 2 ounces 
of butter, pepper and salt to taste ; 4 tablespoonfuls of gravy, 2 
tablespounfuls of lemon juice. Wash the potatoes clean and boil 
them in salt and water wiih their skins on, allowing i tablespoonful 
of salt to every gallon of water; when they are done drain them, 
let them cool, then peel jand cut the potatoes into thin slices ; if 
these are too thin they would break in the sauce. Put the butter

these ingredients well together, put in the potatoes, shake them 2 or

three times that they may be well covered with the sauce, and when 
quite hot through squeeze the lemon juice and serve ; 1-2 to 3-4 hour 
to boil the potatoes; 10 minutes to heat them. 

SALADS. 

CHICKEN SALAD (Ella). Take the breasts of 2 chickens, 2 large 
bunches of celery and 4 hard-boiled eggs, chop these separately and 
fine; put together and mix thoroughly; then make a gravy of one 
tablespoonful of fine beaten mustard, 2 tablespoonfuls of sugar, i 
cup of cider or grape vinegar and 1-2 cup of butter, and pour hot 
over the salad. 

LOBSTEH AND FISH SALADS. A very nice and elegant dish may 
be made with all kinds of cold fish and some kinds of shell fish. 
The following is for a small lobster salad, and will do for all fish sal- 
ads : Have the bowl half-filled with any kind of salad herbs you 
like. Then break a lobster in two, open the tail, extract the meat 
in one piece, break the claws, cut the meat of both in small 
slices about 1-4 of an inch thick; arrange these tastefully on the 
salad ; take out all the soft part of the belly, mix it in a basin 
with a teaspoonful of salt, 1-2 a one of pepper, 4 of vinegar and 
4 of oil ; stir it well together and pour on the salad ; then cover it 
with hard eggs cut in slices, a few slices of cucumber, and, to 
vary, a few capers and some fillets of anchovy. 

SWEET BREAD SALAD (Mrs. D. C. B.). Four hard-boiled and 
one raw egg, 2 tablespoonfuls of salad oil, i teaspoonful of salt, i 
of pepper, 2 of sugar, 2 of mixed mustard, 1-2 teacupful of vin- 
egar, i calf's sweet bread and 2 heads of lettuce. For dressing 
mash the yolks and mix the oils thoroughly, adding the vinegar 
last. Boil the sweet bread thoroughly until tender, pick it up in 
small pieces; break the lettuce also in small pieces, and then 
put in a dish alternate layers of lettuce, sweet bread and dress- 
ing. Use the whites of the eggs sliced over the top. 

CABBAGE SALAD. One well beaten egg, i teaspoonful each of 
salt and sugar, 1-2 teaspoonful mustard, 1-4 of a teaspoonful pep- 
per, and 2-3 of a cup of vinegar. Beat all well together, boil in 
a bowl over the steam of a teakettle until quite thick, then pour 
the mixture over a small head of cabbage chopped fine. If too 
thick, add cold vinegar. To be eaten cold. 

NOTE. If liked, chopped lettuce can be used instead of cabbage, 
only the vinegar should be perfectly cold when poured over the let- 
tuce, which should be setting in a vessel of cold water to keep it 
crisp. 

RUSSIAN SALAD. Cook some fillets of quails and chickens in a 



SALADS. 183 

frying-pan with a little butter; drain and put them on a plate to cool. 
Cook some thin slices salmon in the same way. Wash and trim 8 
very small king fish and cut them into small slices together with the 
quails, chickens and salmon. Cut some carrots and turnips with a 
small, round vegetable scoop ; blanch and cook them in water with 
a little salt added ; boil some asparagus peas and some French beans 
cut in diamond-shaped pieces ; drain all above the vegetables, and 
when cold, put them in a basin with the fish, chicken and quail, 
season with salt, pepper, oil, vinegar, a little cayenne and some 
chopped rovicote or celery. Prepare a^Dorder of white jelly, gar- 
rash with olives and small Indian pickles ; when set, turn the bor- 
der out on a dish ; add some partly-melted aspic jelly to the 
salad in the basin; mix and dish it up in layers inside the bor- 
der; pour a little jelly over each layer, and let it set completely 
before adding another; continue the layers, diminishing each one 
until the whole comes to a point, and serve. 

IRISH POTATO SALAD (Mrs. E.'s recipe). Take cold Irish po- 
tatoes that were peeled hot, cut them in thin, round slices, boil some 
eggs hard, mash the yolks hot in vinegar and season it with mustard 
or celery seed and rolled with a pinch of sugar ; put them in a salad 
dish, pour the sauce over them and garnish with the white of an 
egg cut in rings. It is excellent for a Sunday dinner, particularly 
with cold roast beef. 

CUCUMBER SALAD. To 100 cucumbers put a quarter of a peck 
of small onions, pare the cucumbers and slice them thin, also the 
onions. Cover with salt and set in the sun for 6 hours, then rinse 
clean with water several times, letting them remain in the last 
water an hour. For the dressing take a box of the best mustard, 
put into it a little salt and pour olive oil enough to stir it well, 
then vinegar enough to moisten and more oil, and then vinegar 
until it is thin enough to pour smoothly. Fill the jars with cucum- 
bers and pour on dressing enough to completely cover them ; seal 
the jars tight. 

MIXTURE FOR SALAD (Mrs Randolph.) Take a large mealy 
Irish potato that has been boiled, squeeze it through a cloth, and 
while hot mash it fine, then add it to the mixture already prepared 
of the raw yolks of 2 eggs well beaten, 2 tablespoonfuls of pre- 
pared mustard, 4 or 5 spoonfuls of sweet oil, the same of vinegar, 
some pepper and salt, adding a little sugar. Stir all to a perfect 
cream, then pour over lettuce cabbage or any of the salad vegeta- 
bles, cut very fine, or rather coarse, if liked. Shrimps, herring, fish, 
chicken or veal may be chopped and added. Then with a wooden 
fork stir up all lightly and serve. If liked, hard boiled eggs cut up 
coarsely may be added as garnish on the top.

LFMON SAUCE. Cut thin slices of lemon into very small dice and 
put them in melted butter ; give it one boil, and pour it over boiled 
fowls. 

CALIFORNIA SALAD DRESSING. To every 2 hard-boiled eggs take 
the yolk of i raw, 2 tablespoonfuls of oil, i of cider vinegar, salt 
spoonful of salt, a little cayenne pepper, i teaspoonful of white 
ground mustard, white hard lettuce or cabbage, a little sugar, 2 
or 3 tablespoonfuls of cream ; mash the eggs and rub with the raw 
yolk, then add oil and beat up till it is like smooth cream ; beat 
while each ingredient is carefully added i at a time. 

SALAD, RED HERRING (Polish.) Take potatoes boiled and peeled, 
pickled cucumbers, peeled apples, roast veal and salt herrings that 
have been soaked in water, from which the skin and bones have 
been taken, some French mustard, a little sugar, ground white pep- 
per, plenty of sweet oil and best white vinegar. Cut into thin slices 
(or dice or cube shaped), mix the whole together. If sour enough 
and too dry thin with a little water, boiled, or wine, and a more deli- 
cious salad can not be prepared, if the required amount of oil \viih 
the yolk of an egg is made into a sauce mayonaise. It is not easy to 
give the exact quantity of each ingredient, but the mixture will be 
very near right by taking the proportion of 10 herrings to 30 pota- 
toes, and of each of the other ingredients a quantity equal to that 
of the herrings, and on each a quantity of salad it would take nearly 
a pint of sweet oil. Finely sliced onions and beets may be added, 
so also the potatoes may be left out and substituted by roast veal. 
Fill in dishes and dress with thin slices of smoked salmon, parsley, 
beets, pickles, &c. 

SALMON SALAD. Cut some salmon into scallops i 1-2 inch in di- 
ameter and 1-2 inch thick, put them in a buttered frying pan, season 
with salt and pepper and fry them ; when done drain the scallops 
and put them in a dish to cool ; then season them slightly with salt, 
pepper, oil and vinegar; pour a 1-4 inch layer of white aspic jelly 
in a plain bordered mould with some olives, cabbage lettuces cut in 
quarters, and hard boiled eggs, arranging the whole tastefully ; fill up 
the mould with aspic jelly, and when the latter is set turn the border 
out on to a dish. Dish the salmon over some partly melted aspic 
jelly seasoned with salt, pepper, vinegar and chopped parsley or cel- 
ery, and when this first row is set fill up the center with some of the 
unshapely pieces, and dish another and reversed circle of salmon 
scollops on the fish ; pour over some more seasoned jelly, and con- 
tinue reversing and diminishing the circles until they come to a 
point; pour over some more jelly; put i hard-boiled egg with a 
cabbage lettuce heart stuck in it on the top and serve.

on the fire till it acquires a brownish color, throw in about 20 pars- 
ley leaves, i gill of vinegar, 1-2 teaspoonful of salt, a large pinch of 
pepper; boil together i minute. It is excellent with boiled fish. 

MAITRE D' HOTEL BUTTER. Mix well together upon a plate four 
ounces of fresh sweet butter, i good tablespoonful of chopped pars- 
ley, the juice of 2 lemons, a large pinch of salt, a small pinch of pep- 
per ; set in a cool place for use. 

WINE SAUCE. One-fourth pint of claret or port wine, the same 
quantity of plain unflavored mutton gravy, and a tablespoonful of 
currant jelly ; let it just boil up and send it to the table in a sauce 
pan. 

SAUCE FOR SALAD DRESSING. The yolks of 4 eggs, 4 oz. brown 
sugar ; beat well together, add gradually 2 ounces salad oil, beating 
until well mixed, then add 2 ounces salt, 2 ounces mustard, 1-2 oz. 
black pepper and 1-2 pint of strong cider vinegar. This mixture 
surpasses all others by adding to salad, and will keep good fora long 
time. 

OUDE SAUCE (Kennicut.) One pint green tomatoes, 6 peppers, 
not large, 4 onions, chop together, add i cup of salt and let it stand 
over night ; in the morning drain off the water and add i cup of su- 
gar, i cup of horseradish, i tablespoonful of ground cloves, the same 
of ground cinnamon ; cover with vinegar and then stew all gently. 

CAPKR SAUCE WITH VINEGAR. Take 2 spoonfuls of capers and 
a little vinegar, mince the 1-2 and stir the whole of them into 1-2 
pint of melted butter or strong thickened gravy. To prevent the 
butter from oiling stir the sauce for some time. When wanted very 
poignant, lemon juice may be added to this simple and tasteful 
sauce. 

TOMATO SAUCE FOR HOT OR COLD MEATS. Put tomatoes, when 
perfectly ripe, into an earthen jar, set it in an oven; when the juice 
is drawn till they are perfectly soft, then separate the skins from the 
pulp and mix these with Chili vinegar and a few cloves of garlic 
pounded, which must both be proportioned to the quantity of fruit. 
Add powdered ginger and salt to your taste. Some white wine vin- 
egar and cayenne may be used instead of the Chili vinegar. Keep 
the mixture in small wide-mouthed bottles well corked and in a dry 
place. 

SAUCE FOR A TURKEY OR ANY FOWL. Boil some veal gravy, 
pepper and salt, the juice of an orange and lemon, and a quarter 
as much port wine as gravy. Pour it on a dish. 



l86 SAUCES. 

GOOSEBERRY SAUCE. Clip away the tops and tails of a break- 
fast cupful of small green gooseberries, scald, drain and stir into 
melted butter with a little lemon juice or vinegar; a little ginger may 
be added, or the scalded gooseberries may be served mashed with 
sugar and seasoning. 

SAUCE OF CHERRIES OR DAMSONS FOR MEATS. To every Ib. of 
fruit allow 1-2 Ib of brown sugar and i pint of strong vinegar to 
every 7 Ibs. of fruit. Put all into a preserving kettle and simmer 
slowly until done. Take the fruit up and lay it on a large dish. Let 
the syrup continue to boil until thick, adding some cloves and cin- 
namon. Put the fruit in stone jars and pour it over the jars while 
hot. 

EGO SAUCE. Boil a couple of eggs for 1-4 of an hour. Dip them 
in cold water and roll them quickly under your hand to make the 
shells come off easily. Cut the yolks by themselves into little 1-2 
inch cubes, cut the white of i egg in the same manner. Stir first 
the white and the yolk into thinnish butter in the tureen ; or boil 
the eggs hard and cut them into small pieces, then put them into 
melted uutter. 

LIVER AND LEMON SAUCE. Wash the liver of the fowl quite 
clean and boil it for 5 minutes, then pound it ui a mortar with a 
spoonful of the liquor in which it has been boiled and rub through 
a sieve. Take the thin outer rind of a lemon and mince 1-2 tea- 
spoonful very fine ; remove the white inner skin of the lemon ; cut 
it into thin slices, take out the seed, and then cut the whole into 
small squares ; mix the lemon, the rind and the pounded liver into 
1-2 pint of good melted butter or white sauce, and serve with the 
fowl. 

FISH SAUCE WITHOUT BUTTER. Simmer very gently t gill of 
cider vinegar and i cupful of water (which must be soft), with i on- 
ion, 1-2 handful of horseradish, 4 cloves, 2 blades of mace and 1-2 
teaspoonful of black pepper. When the onion is quite tender, chip 
it with 2 small fish and set the whole on the fire to boil for a few 
minutes with a spoonful of catsup. In the meantime have ready 
and well beaten the yolks of 3 fresh eggs; strain them, mix the 
liquor by degrees with them, and when all are mixed set the sauce- 
pan over a gentle fire, keep a basin in one hand, into which toss the 
sauce to and fro and shake the sauce-pan over the fire that the eggs 
may not curdle. Don't boil them, only let the sauce be hot enough 
to give it the thickness of melted butter. 

OLD CURRANT SAUCE FOR VENISON. Boil an ounce of dried cur- 
rants in 1-2 pint of water for a few minutes; then add a small tea- 
cupful of bread crumbs, 6 cloves, a glass of port wine and a bit of 
butter. Stir it until the whole is smooth. 



SAUCES. 187 

APPLE SAUCE FOR BOILED GOOSE. Pare, core and slice three 
large, sound apples, put them into an earthenware jar with two ta- 
blespoonfuls of water, cover the jar and put it into a slow oven 
for 3-4 of an hour, then add 1-2 teaspoonful sugar and 1-2 oz. 
butter; beat with a fork to a light pulp. Serve in a tureen. 

TOMATO CATSUP (Aunt H.'s recipe). Take a peck ot ripe to- 
matoes; cut them up tolerably fine, put them in a preserving 
kettle and boil them very soft; then mash them well and strain 
through a sieve. Season with salt and cayenne pepper, black 
pepper, pounded cloves and mustard seed to suit the taste. Let 
it boil until 1-2 has boiled away. When cold, add a teacupful 
of cider vinegar to each bottle before sealing it up, as you would 
canned fruit. 

A VERY CHOICE CATSUP. Take 1-2 Ib. of anchovies or very 
small fish, wash them in 1-2 pint of the purest cider or wine 
vinegar; mash them, bones and all, put them into a 1-2 pint of 
of the best vinegar and 8 tablespoonfuls of claret, and let it boil 
for 15 minutes. Then strain the vinegar to it and put in 1-2 a 
pint more of pure vinegar or white wine ; 5 or 6 cloves of shal- 
lots, i tablespoonful of powdered white ginger, 1-2 a one of com- 
mon pepper, 1-2 one of California pepper all crushed i nut- 
meg bruised, a piece of lemon peel, and a few blades of mace ; 
put the whole into a stew-pan and let it boil 1-2 an hour, then 
pour it off. When perfectly cold bottle it. The bottles should 
be entirely dry. Cork well and tie them down closely. 

MUSHROOM SAUCE. Wash and pick a large breakfast cupful of 
small button mushrooms ; take off the leathery skin ; stew them in 
vea! gravy with pepper, cayenne, mace, nutmeg, salt and a piece of 
butter roiled in a good deal of flour or arrowroot to thicken, as the 
abounding gravy of the mushrooms makes them take a good deal of 
thickening. Stew until tender, stirring them now and then, and 
pour the sauce over the fowls. Those who like a high relish of 
mushrooms may have a spoonful of gravy drawn by salting a few 
for a night, or a little mushroom powder. 

ORANGE SAUCE FOR GAME. Peel 1-2 an orange, removing the 
pith, cut it into slices, then into pellets, put them on in a gill of wa- 
ter and boil for two minutes, drain them on a sieve, throwing away 
the watt r, place in a stew-pan two spoonfuls of broth, when boiling 
add the orange, and a little sugar. Simmer ten minutes, skim and 
serve; the juice of 1-2 orange, is a great improvement. Also a little 
cinnamon may be added. 



1 88 PICKLES. 



PICKLES. 

Small cabbages should be cut in 2 or 4 parts and larger ones 
into more divisions. Boil them in salt and water until they be- 
come soft enough to be penetrated with a straw, lay them on a 
cloth to drain, then lay them on a flat, wide dish and let them 
dry, then lay them in clear water for 24 hours, then put them in 
the prepared liquid, cut in the branches of cauliflower and pre- 
pare them in the same way. Cucumbers and other vegetables 
may be pickled in the manner given in recipes. 

Pickles may be purchased at as low rates as they can usually 
be made at home, and even less, perhaps, yet all housekeepers 
who have time and the usual conveniences had better prepare 
them for their own domestic use, as they can select and know 
that they have the purest vinegars, which should always be used, 
as it does not injure the stomach nor impede digestion, as patent 
vinegars do. The fruit and vegetables selected should be firm, 
sound and not over-ripe. Many of the spices should be used spar- 
ingly, as they stimulate the appetite and by insensible degrees de- 
stroy the tone of the stomach. Red peppers are opposite in their 
qualities to black and white peppers. The two last are powerful 
astringents, and consequently impede digestion. The white pepper 
is the best quality of black pepper, and is prepared by soaking it in 
lime and water and rubbing it between the hands until the dark coats 
come off. It is less acrid than the black, and more highly prized as 
a seasoning. It is better to buy the grains whole and pound them 
at home, and both kinds are often adulterated. Black pepper of a 
good quality can be tested by rubbing the corns between the hands. 
If they are good they will not be crushed. Dyspeptics should not 
use black pepper; it may afford a temporary relief at the expense 
of permanent mischief. It is good as a condiment in malarious dis- 
tricts, which engender endermic diseases, and serves as an antidote. 
Nutmeg should be used cautiously by persons of a paralytic or ap- 
oplectic predispositions. They are astringent in their properties. 
The superior quality is firm, hard, and has a strong aromatic odor 
with a pungent and acrid flavor. Ginger as a condiment is more 
wholesome; is anti-spasmodic and carminative in its properties, and 
is excellent in allaying thirst. Allspice is a mild and innocent spice, 
combining an agreeable variety of flavors. 

Horseradish should be fresh when used, as its volatile oil escapes 
so rapidly. It can be preserved by burying it in sand. By leaving 
with the top about i or 2 inches of the .root it will grow by planting 



PICKLES. . 189 

it in a moist place, and should be planted on small or large streams 
where the moisture will cause it to grow and be always ready for 
use. 

Mustard, either powdered or not, is good for the digestive or- 
gans. 

Lemon rind or peel, when dried, used moderately, is a good 
digestive for weak and delicate persons. Lemon juice was con- 
sidered by the ancients as an antidote for poison, even of the bite of 
serpents, and is now essential for culinary purposes, but as antiscor- 
butic for seafaring persons it is invaluable. It can be preserved in 
bottles for a long time by covering it with a thin stratum of oil. It 
is sometimes crystallized and called salts of lemon or citric acid 
crystallized. A delightful syrup can be made of it with water, rum 
and sugar to taste, or lemonade by adding it to water and sugar. 
No one should go to sea without it. It is cooling, grateful and a 
sovereign remedy in kidney diseases. 

Pickles of flowers, herbs, roots and vegetables in vinegar were 
held in high estimation by the ancient Greeks and Romans, and pre- 
served by them with the greatest care. 

Every housekeeper should have all of her jars labelled and a 
wooden spoon always at hand. 

A good housekeeper will know how and when to utilize and econ- 
omize in the preparation of every dish. 

PICKLED PEARS. Twenty pounds of peeled fruit, 7 Ibs. of sugar, 
i quart of vinegar ; boil the sugar and vinegar together, put a cou- 
ple of cloves in each pear and put them into the sugar and vinegar 
with water enough to nearly cover them. When cooked enough re- 
uiove the pears to stone jars, and after boiling the pickle for 15 min- 
utes longer pour it over them. Examine in a week, and if the pickle 
is not sufficiently concentrated remove and boil down again. 

MUSTARD PICKLES. Make a paste of pounded white mustard, 
some salad oil and some vinegar ; then add to these some powdered 
cinnamon, white and cayenne pepper, white ginger, celery seed and 
horse radish, all fine, i tablespoonful of brown sugar, and put them 
all into a stone jar 2-3 full of vinegar, then set the jar into a kettle 
of cold water on the fire, bring it to a boil, and continue it for 2 or 
three hours, skimming it now and then. As soon as removed from 
the fire stir in with a wooden spoon or fork some tameric and white 
mustard. Fill the jars with small cucumbers, gherkins, onions, caul- 
iflower, hard white cabbage tops, small, sliced cucumbers, young 
parsnips and tender corn. The cinnamon can be omitted if liked, as it 
makes the color darker. 

NOTE When the vegetables are used others can be added, or you 
may take dwarf cabbages, quarter them, then simmer them in brine 



190 . PICKLES. 

till you can pierce them with a straw, then dry them on a cloth for 
twenty-four hours to absorb the moisture, then drop them into the 
liquid. 

RKD CURKANT PICKLES. Pick them before they are quite ripe 
and put them in a well covered jar filled with a brine of salt and 
water. When the pickles begin to ferment change the brine ; 
then lay them for a night in clear water, then make a spiced liquor 
with sugar and spices boiled in the vinegar, as in cherry pickles ; 
when cold pour over your currants and close tightly. 

BAKBERRY PICKLES. Gather full, fine clusters of the berries be- 
'fore ripe, pick away the dead leaves and detective berries and pre- 
serve them as red currants. 

SWEKT PICKLE (Peaches, Damsons or Tomatoes.) Mrs. W., 
Va. Peel your tomatoes or peaches, take the stones from them or 
not, cut off the stem end (a very little of which will make the pickle 
bitter; even one will spoil ajar of pickles), if damsons, or plums or. 
grapes, prick them with a fine needle and allow to each pound of 
fruit a cupful (1-2 pint) of vinegar, 1-2 pound of sugar, a teaspoon- 
ful of cloves, a few blades of mace and cinnamon. J'ut your fruit 
in a jar which can be covered closely, then put the vinegar, sugar 
and spices on to boil, then pour all over the fruit and cover closely. 
Let remain 24 hours ; repeat the scalding in the same vinegar and 
let it remain on the fruit another 24 hours, then put the whole on to- 
gether and boil until the damsons, plums or grapes burst open, or 
the peaches or tomatoes are easily pierced with a straw and the 
syrup thickens a little. 

OLD DOMINION CHOW CHOW. Take 2 gallons of nice green to- 
matoes, add 4 good sized onions, 6 or 7 peppers with the seeds taken 
out, chop together and boil 3 minutes in 5 quarts of good cider vin- 
egar, throw this vinegar away after straining, then to i gallon of cider 
vinegar when scalding hot add 3 cups sugar, one of mixed mus- 
tard, one table-spoonful of cloves, i of allspice, 2 of cinnamon, 3 
or 4 blades* of mace, i cupful of chopped horseradish, and 3 
spoonfuls of salad oil ; pour hot over the tomatoes. 

CHOW CHOW (splendid.) One-half gallon sliced green tomatoes, 
3 cups of chopped onions, i pint of chopped green peppers, i cup 
of white mustard seeds, i cup of coriander seeds, all chopped fine, 
2-3 cup of salt. Cover over in a jar with cold fruit vinegar. The 
longer you keep it the better it is. 

PICKLED EGGS. Boil a dozen eggs until done and quite hard, 
then put them in a vessel of cold water in order to remove the shells 
with ease and prevent them being broken ; then have a stone or 
earthen jar just large enough to hold them within an inch or two 
of the top. Put them in the jar carefully, prepare a liquor of 



PICKLES. 

the purest and best vinegar (white wine), say a quart or more, 
by boiling gently, spice with 4 blades of mace, 3-4 of an ounce 
of black or white pepper, 3-4 of an oz. of allspice, i oz. of white 
ginger, 3-4 oz. mustard (white) seed, and 4 cloves of garlic. 
When the spiced liquor has simmered for 3 minutes, take it up 
and pour slowly into the jar, observing that the eggs are fully 
covered with the liquor. When cold, stop it tightly for use ; 
which will be in the course of a month, or five weeks. When 
traveling, they are nice with cold viands as a lunch, affording a 
fine relish ; when quartered they are a nice garnish to dishes of cold 
meats of any kind. 

SWEET PICKLED CABBAGE. Cut the cabbage fine and scald it in a 
brine made of i cup of salt and j quart of water; let it remain a 
day and night ; squeeze it out and put in good cider vinegar with 

1 oz. of cinnamon, i oz. of mace, i oz. nutmeg, i 1-2 Ibs. sugar and 
1-2 gallon cider vinegar. 

ONION PICKLES. Take 1-2 Ib. of crushed ginger, 1-2 of white 
mustard, 1-2 Ib. salt, 4 oz. white mustard seed, whole, 2 oz. black or 
white pepper ground, 1-2 oz. cayenne pepper, 1-4 Ib. of tameric to 

2 gallons of good cider or pear vinegar. Then have ready a large 
jar with a tightly fitted top, put in your onions, sliced cucumbers (or 
cut an inch and a half long), cauliflowers, celery seeds, gherkins, 
green tomatoes, green radish pods, nasturtiums, martinas and small 
green chilis. Reserve enough vinegar to mix the various powders 
to a well-worked paste, so that no lumps remain, then pour the vin- 
egar into the jar over the fruit, then add the thoroughly prepared 
spice mixture. Keep the jar in a warm place and stir up well every 
morning tor a month with a wooden spoon ; or the liquor can be 
prepared and kept as directed, and the different vegetables can be 
added at pleasure, as they come in season, gathered on a dry morn- 
ing, wiping them with a dry cloth to remove the dust and moisture. 
The cauliflower must be divided into small bunches. When the jars 
are full, and it is no longer needful to stir them, close the jar firmly 
with a bladder or waxed cloth, over the mouth. Pickles prepared 
in this way will be good at the end of the year. While it is im- 
portant to stir the pickles every morning, it is best to keep a wooden 
spoon always convenient. 

SWEET PICKLED RIPE CUCUMBERS. Take ripe cucumbers before 
they grow soft or have an unpleasant smell, slice lengthwise, so as 
to be clear of seeds ; scald for half a day in salt water ; pour that 
off and rinse in warm water. Take a pint of sugar to a quart of 
good cider vinegar, flavored with spice, clove, cinnamon, ginger and 
allspice to the taste ; scald the fruit once a day for several consecu- 
tive days by pouring the boiling liquor over it. Be careful not to put 
them in an iron vessel, which will turn them dark. 



192 PICKLES. 

GREEN CUCUMBER PICKLES. Make a brine by putting 2 pints of 
rock salt into 2 gallons of boiling water and pour it over the cucum- 
bers ; cover tight to keep in the steam, and let them remain all night 
and part of a day ; make a second brine as above, and let them re- 
main the same length of time ; then scald and skim the brine, as it 
will answer for the third time, and let them remain in it, as above ; 
then rinse and wipe them dry, and add boiling hot vinegar; throw 
in a lump of alum as large as a nutmeg to every two gallons of 
pickles, and you will have a fine, hard and green pickle. Add spices 
if you like and keep the pickles under the vinegar. A weight on the 
top of the cover, which keeps the pickles under, has a tendency to 
collect the scum, which may rise. 

SWEET TOMATO PICKLES. Take 5 onions, 5 green peppers or 
chilis, sprinkle them over with a teacup of salt and let them stand 
during a night, then drain the water from them, adding to them one 
cup or more of sugar (if desired), i cup of grated horseradish, i 1-2 
tablespoonfuls of cinnamon, i spoonful of cloves, 3-4 of allspice, i 
tablespoonful of white ginger ; more than cover with strong cider 
vinegar and cook until tender, with 2 gallons of sliced green toma- 
toes. Put in bottles. 

SWEET GREEN TOMATO PICKLES Peel and slice 2 gallons of 
green tomatoes, 3 gallons of whole mustard seed, 5 tablespoonfuls 
black pepper, 2 of ground cinnamon, i spoonful whole cloves, i of 
brown sugar and 3 gills of good vinegar. Boil until quite tender. 

PICKLED CABBAGE. Chop up, as for slaw, sprinkle with salt and 
let stand for a day and night ; drain on a cloth to absorb the moisture. 
Put it into a jar with alternate layers of white mustard between and 
fill with cold vinegar. 

FAVORITE PICKLES. One quart raw cabbage chopped fine, i of 
boiled beets chopped fine, 2 cups sugar, tablespoonful salt, i tea- 
spoonful black pepper, 1-4 teaspoonful red pepper and teacup of 
grated horseradish ; cover with cold vinegar cover very closely, to 
exclude the air entirely. 

CAULIFLOWER PICKLES. Take firm cauliflowers before they are 
quite ripe and cutaway the bark of the stems and all the green leaves. 
Scald them for four minutes in a pan of boiling salt brine, and then 
drain and dry thoroughly, which will require at least 24 hours ; when 
dry pull them into perfectly-sized branches, cutting the stalks smoothly 
and pack them in jars with some pickle liquor, as directed for yel- 
low pickled cabbage, or color them with red beets in the liquor. 



YEAST. 193 



YEAST. 

YEAST POWDERS, OUR MOTHER'S. Baking soda 6 ounces, cream 
of tartar 8 ounces ; be particular that the materials are perfectly 
pure and dry. Then mix thoroughly and keep dry in a well corked 
bottle or tightly covered box. You need nothing further. 

YEAST WITHOUT HOPS. Boil i pound of flour, 4 ounces brown 
sugar, a pinch of salt in 2 gallons of water for one hour. When 
lukewarm bottle and cork closely. In 24 hours you can use it ; 
wetting your flour with it. 

To REMOVE THE BITTER QUALITY FROM YEAST. Bake a small 
piece of bread quite black and drop into the yeast ; or, if it is 
very bitter put a small quantity of bran into a sieve (small) and 
strain the yeast through ; or pour some cold water over the yeast 
some time before you require it ; the yeast will sink and the bitter 
remain in the water, which pour off. This will apply to both leav- 
en and liquid yeast. These remedies have never been known to 
fail. 

To CHOOSE HOPS. Put them between your fingers ; good hops 
will feel gelatinous and have a fragrant smell and develop a fine yel- 
low dust. 

YEAST THAT WILL NOT SOUR. (Mrs. Adams.) Boil 2 ounces of 
hops in 2 quarts of water, put in a jar i cup of brown sugar, strain 
the hops into the jar, add i cup of flour stirred smooth, let it stand 
in a warm place till it ferments, stir in 6 boiled and mashed potatoes 
and i cup of salt. 

To MAKE YEAST FOR BREAD. One and one-half ounces of hops, 
3 quarts of water, i pound of bruised malt, 1-2 pint of yeast. Boil 
the hops in the water for 20 minutes, let it stand for about 5 min- 
utes, then add it to i pound of bruised malt prepared as for brewing. 
LeUhe mixture stand covered till about lukewarm, then put in not 
quite 1-2 pint of yeast; keep it warm and let it work 3 or 4 hours, 
then put it into small 1-2 pint bottles (ginger beer bottles are the 
best for the purpose), cork them well and tie them down. The 
yeast is now ready for use ; it will keep good for a few weeks, 
and one bottle will be found sufficient for 18 pounds of flour. 
When required for use boil 3 pounds of potatoes with salt, mash 
them in the same water (they should have been peeled) in which 
they were boiled, and rub them through a colander; stir in about 
1-2 Ib. of flour, then put in the yeast, pour it into a hole in the middle 
of the flour and let it stand warm on the hearth all night, and in the 
morning let it be quite warm when kneaded. The bottles of yeast 
require very careful opening, as it is generally exceedingly ripe ; 20 



194 YEAST. 

minutes to boil the hops and water, the yeast to work 4 or 5 hours; 
1-2 pint sufficient for 18 pounds of flour. 

KIRKKESTHAM YEAST. Two ounces of hops, 4 quarts of water, 
1-2 pound of flour, 1-2 pint of yeast. Boil the hops and water for 
20 minutes, strain and mix with the liquid 1-2 pound of flour and 
not quite 1-2 pint of yeast. Bottle it up and tie the corks down. 
When wanted for use boil potatoes according to the quantity of bread 
to be made (about 3 pounds are sufficient for about a peck of flour) ; 
wash them and add to them 1-2 pound of flour and mix about 1-2 
pint of the yeast with them ; let the mixture stand all day and lay 
the bread to rise the night before it is wanted. Twenty minutes to 
boil the hops and water ; 1-2 pint of this yeast is sufficient for a peck 
of flour or rather more. 

To EXTRACT BITTER FROM YEAST. Beat it up with a white of an 
egg, add a double quantity of water, beat all well together, cover it, 
let it stand all night and pour off the water, when it will be sweet. 
One egg is sufficient for a quart of yeast. 

Miss BETSY'S YEAST. At 4 o'clock a. m. stir a cup of flour in i 
pint of water luke warm ; a little salt ; set it by the fire to rise and 
stir it often ; when it is very light it is ready for use, and will make 
2 loaves of bread very light for tea. 

BAKER'S YEAST. Put i dozen large potatoes and a large handful 
of hops in a pan to boil ; don't peal the potatoes ; wash them clean ; 
when they are soft put i pint of flour in a jar, put the potatoes in 
the flour, and then the hops boiling hot, mash them all together and 
roll in a ball. Put aside until cold, and the water the potatoes were 
boiled in. When both are cold work them together and let it 
rise to the top and then fall. After it falls it is ready for use ; stir it 
well and strain it. Does not increase by rising. 

To MAKE GOOD YEAST. Four good-sized potatoes, and boil in i 
gallon of water together with as much hops as you can grasp in your 
hand, placing the hops in a thin cloth and tie them up. When boiled 
take the potatoes and mash them ; add i cup salt, i cup sugar; mix 
thoroughly, adding the hot water in which the potatoes and hops were 
boiled ; let it stand until cool, then add i pint of baker's yeast, let 
it stand until fermented. Put in a jug and cork tight and keep cool, 
When the jug is nearly empty it can be filled again by this process, 
thus keeping a constant supply. One pint of the yeast is sufficient 
for a baking for a moderate sized family. 

BAKING POWDERS. Tartaric acid 4 1-2 ounces, arrow root or nee 
flour 5 ounces ; mix. 

FAMILY YEAST. Thicken 2 quarts of water with fine flour (three 
teaspoonfuls),boil 1-2 hour, sweeten with 1-2 pound of brown sugar, 
when near cold put into it 4 spoonfuls of fresh yeast in a jug, shake 



YKAST. 195 

it well together and let it stand i day to ferment near the fire with- 
out being covered. There will be a thin liquor on the top, which 
must be poured off. Shake the remainder and cork it up for use. 
Take always 4 spoonfuls of the old to ferment the next quantity, 
keeping it always in succession ; 2 pounds loaf will require about 
a gill. 

ANOTHER WAY. Boil i pound of potatoes to a mash; when 1-2 
cold add i cup of yeast and mix it well. It will be ready for use in 
2 or 3 hours and keep well. Use double the quantity of this to what 
you do of beer yeast. To take off the bitter of yeast put beer into 
a sieve and pour it through, having first mixed a little warm water 
with it. 

DOMESTIC YEAST. Have ready in a kettle over a fire 2 quarts 
of boiling water, throw in a large handful of hops as fresh as possi- 
ble, either ripe or green, (or even the green leaves will do,) and let 
the water continue to boil with the hops in it for 25 minutes or more, 
then have in a bowl or pan 6 cups of sifted flour. Strain the liquor 
through a cloth from the hops into another bowl and pour it hot over 
the flour (about 1-2 of it.) Squeeze the bag well, stir the hop liquor 
and the flour to a smooth paste or batter, let the other half of the 
liquor remain till cool, then pour it gradually to the rest, stirring all 
the time. Then take 1-2 pint of baker's or brewer's yeast, let it be 
fresh and strong, stir this yeast into the hop water and flour, pour it 
directly into your jug slightly corked till it ceases to ferment, which 
should be i hour, when it will be fit for use. Cork tightly and keep 
in a cool place. If kept in a bottle it will improve by adding a raisin 
into each bottle before you pour in your yeast. Into a stone jug 
put 6 or 7. In preparing new yeast, if sour, old yeast should never 
be used. All yeast is better and more powerful for being fresh. In 
the country yeast should be made often. In towns and cities it 
can be obtained every day. Sweet cakes, rusks, &c., require stronger 
and fresher yeast than bread, otherwise the sugar will impede their 
rising. The foregoing recipe is invaluable in the making of home- 
made bread. Before making new yeast the old should be removed, 
and the bottles and jugs purified by washing and leaving a little earth 
or salsoda in them for a while, and then thoroughly rinsed. 

PEACH LEAF YEAST. Take 3 large leaves and 3 medium sized 
Irish potatoes, boil them in 2 quarts of water ; when the potatoes are 
done take out the leaves and throw them away ; peel the potatoes 
and mash them up while hot in i pint of flour, adding sufficient water 
to make it a paste, then pour on the hot peach leaf tea and scald for 
5 minutes ; add 1-2 cupful of old yeast and it will be ready for use in 
a few hours. 

YEAST MADE Of THE LEAVES OF THE BASKET WILLOW. In the 
same way that hops is made; is better than when made of hops. 



196 YEAST. 

BREAD, WILLOW. The leaves of our common basket willow makes 
an excellent yeast or leaven for light bread when treated as hops. 
It mixes much quicker than hops ; in 1-2 the time ; imparts none of 
that disagreeable hop flavor which is so objectionable to many. In- 
deed, it makes better bread every way. The willow is a most health- 
ful tonic. Is used as potent against ague in malarious districts. 
Simply use a very weak tea made of these leaves to a quart of boil- 
ing water. 

YEAST THAT WILL KEEP 3 MONTHS. (N. Y. T.) In the hottest 
weather and much longer in cold, and never become sour. The 
flour should be thoroughly dried by the fire ; stirred up often before 
made into a sponge, an important item of which ma^ny farmer's 
wives are ignorant. The sponge or dough should be set at noon, 
mixed at night and moulded next morning ; stirring the sponge after 
it begins to ferment makes it white. 

RECIPE. One quart of hops put lightly in a cup, i quart of pota- 
toes peeled and sliced, i pint of corn browned like coffee ; put the 
hops in the small bag, add 3 quarts of boiling water, boil 2 hours. 
Strain through a colander, add i cup of white sugar, 1-2 cup of salt 
and water to make 5 quarts of the mixture. When luke warm add 
i pint of the same kind of yeast to ferment it. If that is not at hand, 
use potato yeast without meal or flour, as that might sour after a 
while; 1-2 a cup is enough for a baking, large and small. The yeast 
must be made in tin or porcelain. Set it about 24 hours in a warm 
room, then bottle or cork tightly and keep in a cool room; 1-2 the 
ingredients will do for a small family. 

MRS. GEN. R. E. LEE'S YEAST. Boil 6 Irish potatoes and ahand- 
fbl of hops in 2 quarts of water, when cooked wash the potatoes, 
strain the hop tea and mix with the potatoes, thicken with 1-2 pint 
of flour, return all to the kettle and bring to the boiling point ; add a 
heaping tablespoonful of salt and set the proportion with 1-2 pint of 
yeast. This will keep good one week in a cool place. 

BUTTERMILK YEAST. One quart of buttermilk, 2 teaspoonfuls of 
sugar, i quart of meal, 1-2 cupful of hop yeast, set to rise 8 hours, 
then stir in i quart of corn meal, make it out in thin cakes and dry 
them in a cool, airy place. Use one quart of flour to each cake. 

MRS. JANSON'S YEAST. Mash 3 moderate sized Irish potatoes, 
boiled with the skins on with a good pinch of hops, when done 
mash with the skins on, then put back into the liquid in which 
they were boiled with 2 cups of flour, then pour it through a 
sieve, still stirring it over the flour, and let it stand till luke warm, 
then stir in 3 tablespoonfuls of brown sugar, i heaped tablespoon- 
ful of salt, add a little brewer's or domestic yeast, as convenient. 
Let stand over night to ferment, place in a jar kept closely cov- 
ered ; allow 4 tablespoonfuls of yeast to one pound of flour. 



YKAST. I 97 

IRISH POTATO YEAST. (Mrs. R. S. Robertson.) Grate a well 
mashed, peeled and large Irish potato or 2 medium sized ones, 
put the grated potato into a tin or porcelain pan, pour over boil- 
ing water, stirring while doing so till it becomes a thick starch, 
and also adding at the same time more than half a cupful of loaf 
or white sugar, and 2 tablespoonfuls of salt ; boil it till done like 
starch. When cold bottle and stop it well. In making up the bread 
allow i cup of yeast to every 4 cups of flour ; work the dough well, 
set to rise the same night in a warm place. In the morning work it 
well and put it in a slightly greased pan to rise again in an oven just 
warm, not hot, as that would ruin the bread and make it sour, then 
bake it slowly. If you make up the bread with milk instead of wa- 
ter and with a little butter or sweet lard, it makes it much better. 
Either way it is sweet and wholesome. 

N. B. If the yeast sours sweeten it with sugar and never with 
soda, as that spoils the bread, Always save half a teaspoonful of 
the old yeast to put into the new. It is better to make the yeast of- 
ten, and not use it when it gets too stale. 

POTATO YEAST (Contributed in the great American Dessert by 
Mrs. Belle Greg'g, Cole County, 111.) Six common sized Irish pota- 
toes peeled and boiled till quite soft, leave water enough to cover 
them, mash very fine while hot, then stir in enough flour to make 
a batter, set off to cool, till just blood warm, then add i table- 
spoonful of salt, i tablespoonful of sugar, then add i cup of hop 
yeast. Set in a cool place; for 4 loaves use i spoonful. 

MILK YEAST. To i pint of milk allow i teaspoonful of salt and 
a tablespoonful of flour, mix well, keep it luke-warm by a fire ; in i 
hour it will be fit for use ; rise twice as much as common yeast. If 
sour add a teaspoonful of salt to a pint of yeast when used. If it 
foams lively it will raise the bread, if not, throw it away. Never keep 
yeast in tin. This is made for immediate use. It is convenient for 
loaf bread or biscuits when one wishes to make them up in haste. 

QUICK YEAST MADE WITH MILK. Take a cupful of milk and 2 
large spoonfuls of flour and stir them together; set it near the fire 
and let it rise i hour. This quantity will make t gallon of flour in 
good bread. 

MAGIC YEAST. Twelve hours before you wish to use it stir one 
tablespoonful of brown sugar, 2 of flour and 3 of water together 
and add a small piece of leaven or i spoonful of hop yeast to make 
it rise. Use 2 tablespoonfuls of this to i quart of flour, let the yeast 
remain in a jar, and before it is all used add the flour, sugar and wa- 
ter, as at first, and you will always have nice, fresh yeast that makes 
beautiful bread. Keep 2 jars, and occasionally change them, so you 
can have it sweet and fresh. 



198 YEAST. 

FLOUR YEAST. Mix 1-2 pint of flour with i pint of cold water, 
put it into a sauce pan and make it into a thick paste, stirring it all 
the time, then pour it into a bowl and stir in i cup of hop yeast, 
dessert spoonful of sugar and i of salt, and set it to rise. 

MRS. S.'s YEAST. Monday a. m. boil 2 ounces of good hops 
.in a gallon of water for 1-2 hour. Strain it and let the liquor 
cool down to the warmth of new milk, then put in a handful of 
salt and 1-2 Ib. of sugar, stir i Ib of family flour with a little of 
the hop tea and let it stand till Wednesday, boil 3 Ibs. of Irish 
potatoes, mash them fine and stir in. The next day strain it and 
put it in jugs or bottles, keep in a cool place and it will be good for 
2 months. The last is generally the best. Always keep in a warm 
place. When it is made stir often. 

HOP YEAST. The night before boil a large handful of hops in 2 
quarts of water until it is a very strong tea, strain it in a jar with a 
pint of flour and stir it till very smooth : when cool put in a gill of 
yeast and set it in a warm place till light, and then stop tightly. Al- 
ways make fresh yeast before all you have is used, so you can have 
some to set the new with. 

SIMPLE YEAST. Stir a pint of flour in aquart of luke-warm water, 
put in a teaspoonful of salt and i cup of brown sugar and one of 
yeast; put it to rise, ail when well risen keep it in a cool place. 

DRY YEAST CAKES. (Mrs. Mary Parker.) Make a strong tea 
of hops and thicken with flour ; when fermented stir in as much 
corn meal as yon can make into cakes as large and thick as a small 
cracker and dry in a dish in the shade; when used dissolve 1-3 of 
i in a half cup of water for i quart of flour. 

NOTE This yeast or leaven will keep for 6 months. 

YEAST CAKES. Take some hop yeast when fresh and thicken it 
with meal or flour till very stiff, roll them out and cut in thin, small 
cakes and dry in the sun, soak them in milk an hour before you want 
to make bread ; use i cake the size of the top of a* common tumbler 
to i quart of flour. Be careful in winter not to let them freeze, but 
keep them in a paper bag in a dry place. 

YEAST FOR CAKES OF LEAVEN. Put a large handful of hops in a 
pot with 3 quarts of boiling water and 3 Irish potatoes, let it boil 
tolerably strong to 1-2 gallon, strain it boiling hot over 1-2 gallon of 
sifted flour, stir it well, and when cool add 1-2 pint of yeast or one 
yeast cake, and put it in a bucket to rise ; when light and porous, 
before it begins to fall, make it in small, thin cakes with corn meal, 
put them on a board to dry, put them in a thin bag and hang them 
in a cool and very dry place. In warm weather use i of the cakes 
to i quart of flour for bread, rolls or buckwheat cakes. These can 
be used, and are less troublesome and more economical, as they 
will keep for several months. 



BREAD-MAKING. 199 



BREAD-MAKING. 

The following observations on bread-making are extracted from a 
valuable work on that subject and may be found very useful to 
housekeepers : 

The first thing required for making wholesome bread is the ut- 
most cleanliness; the next is the soundness and sweetness of all 
ingredients used for it, and, in addition to these, there must be at- 
tention and care through the whole process. 

An almost certain way of spoiling dough is to leave it half-made 
and allow it to become cold before it is finished. The other most 
common causes of failure are using yeast no longer sweet, which has 
been frozen, or has had hot liquor poured over it. 

Too small a proportion of yeast or insufficient time allowed for 
dough to rise will cause the bread to be heavy. Heavy bread will 
also most likely be the result of making dough very hard and letting 
it become quite cold, particularly in winter. 

If either the sponge or the dough be permitted to overwork Itself, 
that is to say, if the mixing and kneading be neglected when it has 
reached the proper point for either, sour bread will probably be the 
consequence in warm weather and bad bread in any weather. The 
goodness will also be endangered by placing it so near a fire or 
stove as to make any part of it hot, instead of maintaining the gentle 
and equal degree of heat required for its due fermentation. 

Milk which is not perfectly sweet will not only injure the flavor of 
the bread, but, in sultry weather, will often cause it to be quite un- 
eatable, yet, if milk or butter be fresh and good, its quality will ma- 
terially improve. But the acidity of the milk can be neutralized with 
a little soda, and the quality of the butter sweetened by boiling it 
very gently with sippets of bread in it, which will absorb its rancid- 
ity and leave the butter sweet. 

To keep bread sweet and fresh, as soon as it is cold it should be 
placed in a clean earthen jar, with a cover on it ; this pan should be 
placed a little distance from the ground to allow a current of air to 
pass underneath it. Some prefer it to be kept in a box lined with 
zinc; other persons, on clean wooden shelves without being cov- 
ered, so that the crust may not soften. Stale bread may be freshened 
by warming it through in a gently heated oven. Stale pastry, cakes, 
etc., may also be improved by this method. 



2QO BRF.AD-MAKING. 

The utensils required for making bread, on a moderate scale, are 
a kneading trough or pan sufficiently large so that the dough may 
be kneaded freely without throwing the flour over the edges, and 
also for its rising, a hair sieve for straining yeast and one or two 
strong spoons. 

Yeast must always be good of its kind and in a fitting state to 
produce ready and proper fermentation. Yeast of strong beer or 
ale produces more effect than that of milder kinds, and the fresher 
the yeast, the smaller the quantity will be required to raise the dough. 

As a general rule, the oven for baking bread should be rather 
quick, and the heat so regulated as to penetrate the dough without 
hardening the outside. The oven door should not be opened after 
the bread is put in until, the dough is set or has become firm, as the 
cool air admitted will have an unfavorable effect on it. 

Stoves bake bread admirably, as they can always be brought to 
the required temperature when it is higher than is needed by leaving 
the doors open for a time. 

A FEW HINTS ON THE MAKING AND BAKING OF 

CAKES. 

The currants to be used should be carefully washed, picked, dried 
in a cloth, and then closely examined to see that no pieces of grit or 
stone are left among them. They should then be laid in a dish be- 
fore the fire or stove to become thoroughly dry, as the cakes will be 
liable to be heavy if added when they are damp to the other ingre- 
dients. The butter and sugar should be beaten together for a very 
long time, until the mass has the appearance and consistency of ice 
cream. The eggs should be broken into a cup the whites and yolks 
separately. They should always be strained. Breaking the eggs 
thus, the bad ones may be easily rejected without spoiling the others, 
and consequently there will be no waste. Beat or whisk the yolks 
until all the large bubbles disappear, then stir it into the butter and 
sugar, when the flour or the crumbs should next be stirred in well and 
thoroughly, (bread crumbs are better than flour as they are already 
cooked and are more digestible) and if milk is used it should then be 
added. As eggs are used instead of yeast, they should be thoroughly 
whisked. When they are thick enough to carry the drop that falls from 
the whisk they are sufficiently beaten ; then stir in the currants and 
add the beaten eggs, stirring while adding, and next the flouror bread 
crumbs, and lastly of all, the baking powder, if used. Stir this mix- 
ture well and bake in a moderate oven, (some housekeepers rub 
the butter into the flour, then add the sugar, currants and alspice,) 



HINTS ON MAKING AND BAKING CAKES. 2OI 

warm the milk, stir in it the yeast, and mix the whole into a dough, 
and after kueading it well put it into buttered tins, or better, in tins 
dredged with fine dry bread crumbs, after wiping the butter off, 
then let it rise for nearly an hour before baking. The loaf sugar 
should be well pounded, and then sifted through a fine sieve. Less 
butter and eggs are required for cakes when yeast is mixed with the 
other ingredients. 

Good butter should always be used in making cakes. It saves 
much time and labor to warm, but not melt it, before beating, if 
beaten to a cream. 

The heat of the oven is of great importance, especially for large 
cakes. If the heat of the oven is not tolerably quick, the batter 
will not rise. If the oven is too fierce, and there is any danger of 
the cake burning or catching, put apiece of clean paper over the 
top. Paper that has been printed on or newspaper should never be 
used for this purpose. 

To prevent bread or cake or anything from burning at the bottom 
of the stove, set the cake-pan on a stove-top or on pieces of iron to 
prevent its touching the bottom of the stove, or set a vessel or pan 
of water on the top grate and nothing will burn when the water is in 
it as the steam prevents it; when sufficiently done and you wish to 
brown it, you can remove the pan of water. 

To know when a cake is sufficiently baked, pierce it with a straw 
or plunge a clean knife into the middle of it ; draw it quickly out, 
and if it looks the least sticky put the cake back and close the oven 
until it is done. 

Cakes should be kept in closed tin canisters or glass jars in a dry 
place, or it the cake be not iced put it in a barrel of brown sugar 
and place some of the sugar over it. Cakes made with yeast do 
not keep so light as though made without it. 

Panification or bread-making consists of adding one-half or little 
more of water to the flour and yeast or some leaven matter made of 
malt and hops. But in different countries different fermenting mat- 
ter or leaven is used. In the West Indies the refuse of the distilla- 
tion of rum or "dunder,'' and in the East Indies the liquor which 
flows by making art incision in the palm tree, called "toddy" or 
palm wine. The dough is then worked, and the yeast produces fer- 
mentation or "rising," the dough again acting upon the leavening 
principle, the starch of the flour is converfed into sacharine matter. 
This is again transformed into alcohol and carbonic acid. The escape 
of the caibonic acid in little bubbles, produced by fermentation, is 
prevented by the gluten of the dough, and this causes the little holes 
which are seen in leaven or light bread. The bread to be digestable 
and nice must be made of good and fresh yeast ; when made of 



2O2 HINTS ON MAKING AND BAKING CAKES. 

stale yeast the bread has a sour and disagreeable flavor; inferior 
yeast powders, imperfect fermentation and heavy, indigestable bread. 

In families, the night before the bread is wanted for breakfast, 
the dough is well kneaded. The kneaded dough is wrapped up or 
kept at a moderate, even temperature and left to stand until morn- 
ing. When it has risen it is worked over again, divided into loaves 
or rolls and then put into an oven just warm, and then left to rise 
again. The water evaporating, the loaves will swell up and a yellow 
crust will begin to form upon the top. In opening the door of the 
stove or oven, you are met by steam which quickly passes away. 
The bread is, in all probability, sufficiently baked, or if the crumb is 
elastic and rises again after being pressed down with the finger, 
and if the bottom crust is hard and resonant when thumped with 
the fingers, the bread is sufficiently baked. Bread, if properly made 
and kept in a cool place, ought to be perfectly soft and palatable at 
the expiration of three or four days. It should be at least twenty- 
four hours old before eaten. The stomach that much-injured mem- 
ber of the human body has hard work to digest new bread and 
hot rolls swimming in butter, for these articles, when taken out of 
the oven, are full of moisture; the starch is held together in masses 
and the bread, instead of being crusted so as to expose each grain 
of starch to the saliva, actually prevents their digestion by being 
worked by the teeth into a tough, waxy mass, which lies on the 
stomach like so much lead. 

MAKING BREAD. One teaspoonful of soda, 2 of cream of tartar 
to 3 pints of flour. 

INDIAN BREAD (Mrs. Randolph). Take 2 cups of corn (or In- 
dian meal) and work into it a lump of butter the size of an egg, 
make it up thin with milk and stir in the yolks of two eggs ; set it 
to rise. Just before breakfast bake it in small pans or in one large 
one. Observe to grease them. 

MRS. SANDERSON'S CORN BREAD. One quart of good sweet 
milk, 4 eggs, 2 pints of white corn meal, i spoonful of cooked rice, 
5 spoonfuls of melted butter, some salt, 2 teaspoonfuls of soda. 

VIRGINIA CORN BREAD FOR DINNER. Take 1-2 gallon of corn 
(white) meal and make it up with cold water (if desired, add some 
salt) ; then bake it brown. The meal is superior and, of course, 
the bread will be good. 

VIRGINIA CORN BREAD. Dissolve i tablespoonful of butter in 
3 1-2 pints of boiling milk ; into this scald i quart of Indian meal ; 
when cool, ad'l 1-2 pint of wheat flour, a little sugar, i teaspoonful 
of salt and 2 eggs well beaten ; mix well together and bake in two 
cakes. The tins should be well greased or buttered. 

CORN MEAL BREAD. Beat 2 eggs very light and mix them with 



HINTS ON MAKING AND BAKING CAKES. 2O3 

i pint of sour milk ; add i teaspoonful of soda and stir in i pint of 
meal and i tablespoonful of melted butter ; beat it well and bake in 
a quick oven. 

COLD CORN BREAD. Loaves of cold corn bread can be put into 
the pot of bacon while boiling for a few minutes before dinner, and 
when soaked, serve in a dish with the top of the boiling liquor poured 
over it. Old persons, especially, relish it. 

MRS. BASS' CORN BREAD. Two eggs, 1-2 pint of cream or sweet 
milk, 2 teaspoonfuls of cream of tartar, i of soda or 2 teaspoonfuls 
of baking powder, i cup of wheat flour, i cup of corn meal. Mix 
and stir the batter well for 10 or 15 minutes. Bake i hour. 

ST. CHARLES, N. O., CORN BREAD. Two eggs beaten very light, 
mixed with i pint of sour milk or buttermilk and i pint of bolted or 
very fine meal and 1-2 cupful of melted butter, i tablespoonful soda 
dissolved in sour milk or eggs. Bake in a quick oven. 

INDIAN BREAD OR PONE. Two gallons of corn meal, i cupful of 
flour, i large tablespoonful of salt, 4 cups of warm water, 2 cups of 
yeast (fresh and strong) ; put the meal and flour in a tray together 
and mix them well. Make a hole in the center, then mix the yeast 
and water and pour it into the hole in the meal ; take a spoon and 
stir it with the meal near the center till it forms a smooth batter ; 
then strew the flour over the surface, thinly, so as to cover the whole 
of the dough, warm a cloth and lay it over the tray or pan. In 
winter set it before the fire to rise and in a warm place in the sum- 
mer. When it has risen so that the surface is cracked, throw over 
the salt and work the dough ; if too stiff, add a little warm water, 
which should be at hand ; then knead it for thirty minutes,- putting 
flour over the mass, and let it remain /ully half an hour. Cover it 
and set to rise again ; put the dough in a floured pasteboard and 
divide it into two loaves. Have your oven ready, put in the loaves 
directly and bake for two hours. Corn bread requires longer baking 
than wheat bread When done, wrap the loaf up in a coarse, clean 
moist towel and stand it in a cool place. The moisture from the 
towel prevents the crust from hardening too much while it is cooling. 
Corn bread is always best when fresh. If the dough becomes sour, 
sprinkle over it a little warm water in which a teaspoonful of soda 
or salaratus has been dissolved. Take care that you don't put too 
much alkaline substance in the bread. Corn meal should not be 
bought in large quantities, for it soon spoils. Keep it in a bin if you 
can, in a cool place. 

LEAF CORN BREAD. Prepare the wood-fire as for baking ash 
cake, then make the dough in the same way. After the ashes have 
been opened spread a large cabbage leaf or more on the hearth ; 
mould your corn dough into a cake with your hands, but not so 



2O4 HINTS ON MAKING AND RAKING CAKES. 

large as to come to the edges of the leaf. Then wet your hand in 
cold water quickly and flatten the leaf. Put two or three large cab- 
bage leaves over it. Secure the edges by pressing them down so 
closely that no ashes can enter, then put on some moderately warm 
ashes, then the hot, and finally the coals, and bake slowly. To find 
out if done, carefully i emove the ashes, but do not disturb the leaves, 
strike the loaf with a stick ; if it is not a dead sound, the bread is 
done. Carefully pull it out by putting the poker at the back of the 
bread and carefully remove the leaves, and if done properly the loaf 
will be perfectly clean and sweet. Eat with butter. It will be found 
excellent for persons taking pleasure excursions and- while camping 
out, from the romance of preparing one's own bread and having it 
hot when away from home. Wheat bread can be prepared in the 
same way. If managed rightly it will have a hard crust. No cleaner, 
sweeter or better bread can be made. It should be eaten hot. It 
is good with sweet or buttermilk. 

JOURNEY OR JOHNNY CAKE. Make a good wood fire. Have a 
clean white board with a long handle to rest it against. Make up a 
dough of meal and water, a little salt, then have your board a little 
hot. Put the well-kneaded dough, formed with the hands into a 
cake, on the board and flatten it with the hands ; then place the 
board, not upright, before the fire, the handle supported against 
something. Keep turning the board around, if baked in one place, 
until it is done. The head of a flour barrel or a piece of it will do 
to bake upon by placing a flat-iron behind it, so as not to let it set 
up straight, but slant a little. The ash cake, the hoe cake and the 
Johnny cake can be conveniently made when camping out. The 
meal should be sweet and good in order that the bread may be so. 
W'hite corn meal is sweeter, while the yellow corn meal is richer and 
stronger. 

ASH CAKE OR LEAF BREAD. Make up the required amount of corn 
meal with water and salt or sweet milk; knead it well, then have a hot 
hearth with enough ashes and coals ol wood, open the ashes, leave a 
clean space, or the ashes may be swept away with a broom for the pur- 
pose Then put in the dough after having moulded it into a nice 
form with -your hands, then wet your hands with cold water and 
smooth the dough ; let it remain a moment to dry, then cover it up 
gradually with ashes entirely free from coals ; when of sufficient 
depth put on some embers, then the coals. When done on the 
upper side and not on the under, turn it over and bake the under 
side ; but if the hearth is sufficiently hot this will not be the case. 
Then take it out and wash with a clean rag in cold water. Eat 
with butter while hot. No bread can equal it to eat with butter or 
sweet milk. All the sweetness remains with the bread. To tell

when bread is done, thump it with your fingers. If the sound is 
hollow, it is done. This applies to all kinds of bread. Wheat bread 
can be made in the same way. 

CALIFORNIA JOHNNY CAKE. Three pints of good corn meal, i 
pint of molasses, i cupful of butter, i teaspoonful of ground ginger, 
some boiling water or milk; rub the butter, meal and a little salt to- 
gether, then gradually add the molasses, ginger and boiling water to 
make a soft dough. It must be thoroughly worked with an iron 
spoon. Then grease the board with a little lard or fresh butter; 
spread a dough thinkly on it and- stand it nearly upright before the 
fire by placing a flat-iron or stone at the back of it. Do not let the 
edges bake while the inside is raw. Cut into pieces and send it to 
the table hot ; split and butter them. In baking place the board a 
little slanting before the hottest part of the fire. 

MADAME GETZ' LUCAS CORN BREAD FOR DINNER. For 2 loaves, 
take 5 cupfuls corn meal, 3 cups of flour, sifted together, 5 cups of 
sweet milk, 2 cups of sour milk, i 1-2 teaspoonfuls salaratus. Bake 
two hours. 

CORN HOECAKE. Take newly-ground white corn meal, add a lit- 
tle salt and milk and water sufficient to make a thick batter, grease a 
hoe or griddle and spread the dough on it; when done on one side 
turn it over. 

HOECAKE OF CORN MEAL. Sift your meal of the quantity de- 
sired, then make it up with cold water, a little salt if fancied, knead 
well, have your hoe or griddle hot, but not too hot, test it with a little 
meal or grease it, then with a spoon or your hands form a cake, place 
it on the hoe and bake it. When done on the underside turn it over. 
Thump to see when done. This is good to eat when hot at dinner' 
or breakfast, opened and buttered. 

JOHNNY CAKE. Twof>ints sour milk, 4 eggs, j tablespoonful of 
molasses ; stir in enough white corn meal to make a batter. Bake 
in a pan. 

DIXIE CORN BREAD. Three pints of new white corn . meal, i 
spoonful of lard, 2 cups of milk ; work all well together and bake in 
cakes the size of the hand i inch thick. 

CORN MEAL DUMPLINGS FOR DINNER. When boiling your bacon 
skim off the grease or "top of the pot," and make up some corn 
meal into cakes as large and thin as you may desire. You can 
flatten them or make them into round balls with your hands. The 
liquor should be used boiling hot and worked with a spoon, and 
when nearly cold the cakes should be worked with the hands and 
put into the boiling pot and cooked till done, then put in a dish to 
themselves, with a small portion of the pot-liquor over them. Many 
persons are fond of them when served for dinner, or you may eat 
them with molasses. A good appendage to bacon or salt pork.

milk and add it to 1-2 gallon flour, work to a smooth, stiff paste, 
roll out and cut it in any shape, stick the biscuits with a straw or 
fork, bake in a quick oven on a clean surface, open and butter and 
eat while hot. 

CREAM BISCUITS. Rub i pound each of fresh butter and flour 
together, make a hole in the center, into which put 1-2 pound of 
powdered sugar upon the rind of the lemon that has been rubbed 
previously to pounding, and fchen whole eggs ; mix the eggs well 
with the sugar and mix all well together, forming a flexible paste, cut 
it into round pieces nearly as large as a walnut, stamp them flat with 
a butter stamp of the size of a silver dollar. Bake in a moderate 
oven. 

LEMON BISCUITS. One-fourth Ib. flour, 3-4 Ib. loaf sugar, 6 oz. 
fresh butter, 4 eggs, i oz. lemon peel, 2 dessert spoonfuls lemon 
juice; rub the flour into the butter, stir in the pounded sugar and 
finely minced lemon peel, and when these ingredients are thor- 
oughly incorporated add the eggs, which should have been well 
beaten, and add the lemon juice. Beat the mixture well for a min- 
ute or two, then drop it from the spoon on a buttered tin about 2 
inches apart, as the cakes will spread when they get warm ; place 
the tin in the oven and bake to a pale brown from ten to twenty 
minutes. 

ALMOND BISCUITS. Scald, peel and pound them fine in a mortar, 
sprinkling them from time to time with a little fine sugar, beat them 
a quarter of an hour with an ounce of flour, the yolks of 3 eggs, 1-4 
Ib. fine loaf sugar, and afterwards the whites of 4 eggs whipped to a 
froth. Have ready some paper moulds made like boxes about the 
length of 2 fingers square, butter them within and put in the bis- 
cuits, throwing over them equal quantities of flour and powdered 
sugar, bake them in a moderate oven, and when done of a good 
color, take them out of the papers. Bitter almond biscuits are 
made in the same manner, with this difference only, that to every 2 
ounces of bitter almonds must be added i ounce of sweet al- 
monds. 

COCOANUT BISCUITS. Ten ounces sifted sugar, 3 eggs, 6 ounces

BATTER CAKES. 



BATTER CAKES. 



PLAIN CORN BATTER CAKES. Take as much corn meal as you 
may think necessary, sift it and then add salt, an egg or two, a little 
lard or milk or meat broth, a small teaspoonful of soda or more, 
beat well, fry on a hot and well-greased griddle. The cakes should 
be small, not larger than a cup. Butter and pile them on a hot 
plate; eat with molasses, honey or butter. Use skimmed milk. 
These cakes are good as well as economical. 

CORN MEAL BATTER BREAD. One pint each of sifted corn meal, 
buttermilk or clabber, i teaspoonful of soda, 4 eggs, all beaten and 
added last ; salt to taste. It is best to beat the eggs before adding 
them. 

BATTER CAKES. Two quarts of yellow corn meal, sifted, i cup of 
lard, i teaspoonful of salt, i of saleratus or a large one of soda dis- 
solved in warm water or sour milk, i or 2 eggs; stir until well-mixed, 
then add enough cold water or enough of the broth in which bacon, 
pork or beef has been boiled, to soften the compound. It is better 
to have it warm, then beat 9r stir thirty minutes with a heavy spoon, 
then have your^ griddle hot, and bake as buckwheat cakes. It is 
better to butter them when taken up, even if molasses is used, and 
send them to the table hot. You can make them without eggs, and 
the batter can stand for hours without injury, only stir well when 
about to cook the batter. 

WASHINGTON CORN BATTER CAKES. Add i pint of cold water or 
buttermilk, i teaspoonful of salt, to 3 pints of corn meal, an even 
teaspoonful of soda or salaratus dissolved in water or buttermilk, i 
spoonful flour, i 1-2 pint of buttermilk or warm water, add more 
water if not thin enough ; then have the griddle hot and well-greased, 
tied up in a clean white rag ; beef suet, lard or butter may be used. 
Bake the cakes fast by putting on a laddleful. Send in piles hot to 
the table. Remove the rough edges. These cakes do not require 
eggs. 

VIRGINIA CORN BATTER CAKES. Three pints white, raw, ripe In- 
dian meal (which is as white as the driven snow), a small cup of 
fine flour, a large, heaping spoonful of butter, as many eggs as you 
may like, i 1-2 pints of sweet milk or pot-liquor formed by boiling 
bacon, pork or beef in water ; sift the meal into a tray and mix the 
flour and salt with it and the batter, then pour in the milk gradually, 
until the whole is thoroughly incorporated, then break the eggs into 
the compound and stir for 10 or 15 minutes with a strong spoon. If 
more milk be required, add it. Have the griddle clean, hot and 
well-greased with fresh lard tied in a clean rag, then with a spoon

pour in the batter to the size and thickness desired. When the un- 
derside is brown turn it with a knife or cake-turner. Remove and 
put on a hot plate and butter it, and grease the griddle again and 
put on another cake ; when done lay it on the other and butter it, 
and thus continue as long as the cakes are wanted. 

INDIAN AND RYE BREAD. 

INDIAN RYE BREAD. Four pints of corn meal, 4 pints of rye flour, 
i 1-2 pints of milk or water, 1-2 tablespoonful of salt, i cup of good, 
fresh yeast. After sifting the rye flour and meal together add the 
salt and pour the milk scalding hot on the mixture and stir it very 
hard until all are well-mixed. If the dough is too stiff, add some 
warm water, let it stand until it becomes milk-warm, then stir in the 
yeast. Knead the compound into a stiff dough for 30 minutes, 
then cover the pan with a thick cloth folded several times, that has 
been warmed; and set it in a warm place or before the fire to rise ; 
when the dough is quite light and cracked on the top, take it out of 
the pan and put it on a tray and knead it again for 10 or 15 minutes, 
divide it into 2 loaves, then set it near the fire cover it, let it remain 
for 30 minutes. Having the oven ready, put in the loaves immedi- 
ately and bake i 1-2 hours. If the dough is sour, sweeten it by 
adding i teaspoonful of soda dissolved in a little hot water. 

INDIAN WHEAT BREAD can be made in the same manner by using 
wheat flour instead of rye. A little Indian meal is a great improve- 
ment to homemade bread, as it keeps it moist and sweet. 

BOSTON RYE AND INDIAN BREAD. Eight cups each of corn meal 
and rye flour, 2 cups of good, strong yeast, i cup of mglasses, i 
dessert spoonful of salt. After sifting, mix the meal and rye flour 
with the salt in a large woo'den bowl or tray ; have ready i cup of 
warm, but not too hot water; mix the molasses and stir in the yeast. 
Make a hole in the center of the meal, then with a spoon stir in all 
the flour that surrounds the hole till it forms a thick batter; put the 
compound in a pan and sprinkle the top with rye meal ; place a 
thick cloth over the pan and set it in a warm place to rise. In 3 or 
4 four hours it will be cracked all over the top ; in this case it is 
light enough ; then open the middle and gradually pour in two cups 
of warm water ; as you pour in, work it till the whole is so mixed as 
to become a round mass of dough. Then flour hands and work it 
for 30 minutes until the dough ceases to stick to your hands ; turn 
it over, then sprinkle it again with rye flour, and again set it in a 
warm place to rise. Have your oven at a proper heat, so that the 
bread may be put in as soon as it rises the second time. When 
light the dough will stand high and the surface cracked all over. 



INDIAN AND RYE BREAD. 

This will do for a medium loaf. Put it directly in the oven and bake 
it for nearly or quite two hours. The bread will fall if not baked 
immediately. When done, wrap it directly in a coarse, wet towel 
and stand it upright till it is cold. It should be baked in a deep 
iron pan. If the dough should be sour, restore its sweetness by 
adding a teaspoonful of soda or salaratus dissolved in a little water, 
then knead it in the dough. 

PREMIUM RYE BREAD. One quart each of Indian meal and rye 
flour and wheat flour, i teaspoonful of yeast, i one of salt. Make 
a thick batter with warm milk ; pour into pans and let it rise. Bake 
till well done. 

PREMIUM BREAD Take 3 gills each of new milk and boiling wa- 
ter and stir into this flour enough to form a batter ; set it by to rise 
in a warm place ; when sufficiently risen add flour enough to make 
it thick enough to work with the hands, and for baking. Set to rise 
in half an hour ; then bake in a moderate oven, with a thin piece of 
paper over jt. 

SUPERIOR BREAD WITHOUT YEAST. Take cold or ice water, the 
colder the better, and into this stir coarse corn meal to make a stiff 
batter ; stir quickly, adding the meal, so as to introduce all the air 
possible. Put it into small patty-pans or cake tins ; bake in a very 
hot oven for half an hour or longer. Baking is the most difficult 
part of the operation. 

MRS. GEN. R. E. LEE'S BREAD. Take i quart of best family 
flour, put in i egg and sweet lard the size of an egg, 2 large table- 
spoonfuls of yeast (by her recipe), i tablespoonful of salt and i of 
sugar. By this rule bread can be made and the dough kept for 3 
days and sufficient taken off to bake for each day. Mrs. Lee says 
if kept cold in winter or in an ice-house in summer, it will lie dor- 
mant and may freeze without injury. If frozen hard enough to cut 
with an ax it will not be damaged, and will rise readily as soon as 
placed near the fire. If made in this way, to save, and a change of 
temperature causes it to rise, it must be worked immediately. It is 
only in this state that it can be injured or become sour. 

GRAHAM BREAD. 

Take unbolted wheat flour ; mix with water, or better, sweet milk, 
in proportion of 1-3 milk to 2-3 water. Have the liquid in a pan 
and pour in a sufficient quantity of flour, which, after stirring, will 
make a batter that will readily drop from a spoon. Do not salt the 
bread, unless you prefer salt to natural sweetness. Have the pans 
hissing hot, grease them and pour in as much dough as they will 
hold. Do not be in a hurry to bake. Bake 20 minutes in a hot stove, 



GRAHAM BREAD. 217 

and if rightly mixed and baked it will be as light and porous as 
bread raised with yeast. 

BROWN GRAHAM BREAD. Three cups each of corn meal and 
graham flour, i cup of syrup, 2 teaspoonfuls salaratus dissolved in 
sour milk, i tablespoonful salt. Steam 3 hours and bake 8 hours in 
a slow oven. 

BROWN AND SWEET GRAHAM BREAD. Two quarts of graham 
meal, i cup of brown sugar, a little salt and milk and bake like other 
bread. 

BROWN BREAD. Two cupfuls of corn meal, i cupful of rye meal, 
pour in a cupful of boiling water, add 2 cups of sour milk, i tea- 
spoonful each of soda and salt, 1-2 cupful of molasses. Steam in a 
pan all day and brown in an oven. 

CRACKED WHEAT. Take 2 teacupfuls of wheat and rinse it 
thoroughly in cold water, then add 4 cupfuls of cold water, place 
the basin in a steamer and cover closely, Let it steam 4 or 5 hours, 
stirring once or twice. To be eaten hot or cold with rich milk or 
cream if you have either. Many use a little sugar with it and also 
with graham pudding. This is a popular diet and is universally 
used. 

CRACKED WHEAT TO COOK One-third wheat ; boil in 2-3 water. 
Soak the wheat over night. 

HOMINY BREAD.' Mix 2 well-beaten eggs with 2 cupfuls of cold 
boiled hominy, one of corn meal, i tablespoonful of melted lard or 
butter and sweet milk ; form a thin batter and bake slowly. 

FLORIDA BRKAD. One coffee cup of milk, i of sweet white meal, 
i or 2 eggs well beaten ; stir all well together. Bake well. 

HOMEMADE BREAD. Sift the quantity of flour you intend to use; 
put into a bowl 21-2 gills of water to every quart; a large kitchen 
spoonful of yeast, a teaspoonful of salt to every quart ; stir this mix- 
ture well ; put into it a handful of flour for each quart, mix well, then 
take 1-3 of the flour remaining and stir it into the mixture. This is 
called the sponge, and it should be set to rise. When it is well-risen 
turn it into a large bowl; mix in the dry flour, knead quite light and 
set it to rise, then make into loaves and bake. 

BREAD TO SERVE AT TABLE. The plate should be perfectly 
round, with a flat surface and of wood. They cou'd be made very 
handsome. To match the plate, a bread-knife with a wooden han- 
dle should be procured, the blade sharp, thin and long, as it is soon 
dulled by cutting bread. It is better to place two loaves of bread 
markpd on the plate, one white and the other brown bread; so, at time 
when you cut the bread, ask what kind is wished, and if thin or 
thick slices. Cut no more than is necessary. Pass the plate around. 
Never serve the outside of bread or meal unless you are requested 



GRAHAM BREAD. 

to do so. In cutting egg bread to serve a second time take the 
knife and cut off a minute portion of the edi'e and leave it on the 
plate, as that becomes hard, and then cut off a slice. Not much 
strength is required for cutting bread, " but it may be done very 
gracefully." 

LEAVENED BREAD. Harving preserved a piece of dough from your 
last baking, the night before you intend to bake, put this into the 
amount of flour you intend to bake and work the whole together 
with warm water; let it lie in a wooden bowl or tray, covered with 
a thick cloth or a thin one folded several times over it, in a warm 
place. The dough, kept warm, will ris*e again the next morning and 
will prove sufficient to mix with two or three bushels of flour when 
worked up with warm water and one pound of salt to each bushel. 
Being worked well and thoroughly incorporated, cover it, as before, 
till it rises ; then knead aud make into loaves. The more the dough 
leaven is used the lighter the bread will be. 

To MAKE TWIST BREAD. Make the dough, then take three pieces 
each as large as a pint bowl ; sift some flour on the table or board 
and roll each lump under your hand to a foot long, making it smaller 
at the ends than in the middle. Having rolled the three pieces in 
this way, join their ends together, plait them the whole length 
and join the last ends as the first, by pressing them together. Pass 
a brush dipped in milk over the the loaf. Lay in baking tins, set in 
a quick oven ; bake for 55 minutes. When the milk is put on wait 
10 minutes before baking. 

WHEAT BREAD. 

A PLAIN LOAF OF BREAD. One gallon of the best flour or sec- 
onds, i teaspoonful salt, 3 tablespoonfuls yeast, i 1-2 pint of water. 
Allow to rise and bake. Make into a large loaf of bread. 

MEXICAN BREAD. Three pints of flour, i 1-2 pint of sugar, 6 
eggs. Take the white out of 3 of the eggs ; 3 oz. soda. Salt to 
taste. Raise with hop yeast. 

PULLED BREAD. Take from the oven an ordinary loaf when it is 
about half-baked, and with the fingers, while the bread is yet hot, 
dexterously pull the half-set dough into pieces of irregular shape 
about the size of an egg. Don't attempt to smooth or flatten them; 
the rougher their shapes the better. Set upon tins and place in a 
slow oven and bake to a rich brown. This forms a delicious, crisp 
crust for cheese. If you do not bake at home, your baker will pre- 
pare it for you, if ordered. It is very nice with wine instead of 
biscuits. 

BREAD FOR DYSPEPTICS. Scald some Indian meal; mix with it 



WHEAT BREAD. 



2ig 



the same quantity of rye flour, adding yeast and salt, and knead as 
other bread. Bake from two to three hours. 

LOAF BRE\D (Miss Mary McDowell). Mix 2 quarts of flour 
with cold water to a stiff batter, stir in a teacupful of yeast and a 
tablespoon ful of sweet lard or butter; set it near the fire, but not 
too near, and let it rise four hours ; then add a small handful of salt; 
work in more flour, knead it well half an hour ; make into rolls or a 
loaf and let it rise an hour or two before baking it. It requires 11-2 
hours to bake a large loaf. 

SISTER'S BREAD. Three pints of warm water, i tablespoonful of 
yeast, i teacupful of warm yeast ; thicken it with flour to form a 
dough. Let it rise, then work into loaves. Let these rise 1-2 an 
hour; bake 45 minutes. 

WHEAT AND INDIAN BREAD. To 2 quarts of sifted Indian meal 
add hot water enough to wet the same ; when sufficiently cooled add 
i teaspoonful or more of salt, 1-2 of yeast and r teaspoonful of mo- 
lasses; then add wheat flour enough to make it into loaves (it should 
be kneaded well) ; and when risen properly bake or steam it three 
or four hours ; if this should sour while rising, add a teaspoonful of 
sugar and a little salaratus dissolved in water. 

RISEN BREAD. 

MILK "RISEN" BREAD (Mrs. L. C. Mayo). Two cup's of flour 
made into a batter rather thicker than for waffles, with warm milk and 
an equal proportion of water, a tablespoonful of salt. Set it in a 
pot of warm water rather above blood heat, and keep it so, stirring 
it every 15 minutes untill it begins to bead, then keep it perfectly 
still, the water remaining as warm as at first. After it has sufficiently 
risen, knead in flour until nearly the consistency of light bread dough. 
Put it in a tin pan and set it in a moderately warm oven to take a 
second rise. Begin to bake it slowly, putting a little fire under the 
oven and a little on the lid, increasing the heat gradually. About 
i 1-2 hours will suffice to bake it. In cold weather the batter should 
be up by daylight or early dawn. 

SALT RISING BREAD No. i. This bread is superior to common yeast 
bread and is considered more wholesome. Put 3 teacups of water, 
as warm as you can hold your finger in, into a quart cup or bowl 
and 3-4 of a teaspoonful of salt, stir in flour enough to make quite 
stiff batter. This is for the rising or emptying, as some call it. Set 
the bowl, closely covered, in a kettle of warm water, "as warm as 
you can bear your finger in, "and keep it as near this temperature as 
possible. Notice the time when you "set your rising;" in three hours 
stir in 2 tablespoonfuls of flour, put it back, and in 5 1-2 hours from 



22O ^ RISEN BREAD. 

the time of <^t' : :-,g it will be within an inch of the top of your bowl. 
It is then light enough and will make up eight quarts of flour. Make 
a sponge in the center of your flour with i quart of water of the 
same temperature as the rising. Stir the rising into it, cover over 
with a little dry flour and put it where it will keep warm, but not 
scald : in 3-4 of an hour mix this into stiff dough, and if water is 
used, be sure that it is very warm, and do not work as much as yeast 
bread. Make -the loaves a Ifttle larger and keep them warm for an- 
other 3-4 of an hour. It will then be ready to bake. While rising 
this last time leave your oven heating ; it needs a hotter ov&n than 
yeast bread. If these rules are followed you will -have bread as 
white as snow, with a light brown crust, deliciously sweet and tender. 

RISEN CORN BREAD. Make up the required quantity of corn 
meal in the morning or over night with warm water and a little salt ; 
cover and set it away in not too cool a place, or before the fire if 
very cold. Then at night or in the morning, when the dough has 
risen sufficiently, add some more meal, and work it again well. Then 
meal the bottom of the oven, divide into loaves or have but one, 
then put in the dough and set it to rise again. Bake slowly and 
thoroughly, test it by putting a straw through the middle of it. If 
the straw be moist it is not done. It can be eaten in slices with 
butter, either cold or hot. It will keep well for some days. 

SALT RISING BREAD No. 2. Pour into a right-sized bowl a pint of 
new sweet milk and into this a pint of boiling water. Stir in till 
smooth enough flour to make a thick batter, keep at the same tem- 
perature for six hours, when it will rise and should be used at once. 
Sift into a bowl 3 quarts of flour, pour in the yeast, add warm water 
or milk to wet up all the flour. Salt to taste, knead lightly, put into 
pans, let it rise and then bake. N. B In making this bread, great 
care is needed at every stage. The yeast should be used just when 
it passes from the saccharine to the various fermentations and be- 
fore it gets the least sour. Precisely at that moment the raised 
dough should be put into the oven. The dough should be as soft 
when put into the pans as can be conveniently handled. 

Note. Some kinds of flour will not make good salt rising bread. 
The vessel into which the yeast is strained must be scalded out and 
be perfectly sweet, or the yeast will sour before it rises. Nothing 
stale should be used. There is no sweeter or more wholesome bread 
than this when skillfully made. 

FAVORITE SCOTCH BREAD. One pound each of flour or bread 
crumbs, sugar, butter, 8 or 10 eggs, 1-2 pound of citron, candied 
lemon and orange peeling in equal proportions, 4 spoonfuls of French 
brandy, a teaspoonful of salt, 4 ounces of preserved fruit, stewed 
or raw, chopped fine (dark colored fruits should not be used). Put 



RISEN BREAD. 221 

the batter in a bowl or deep dish and stir it with a wooden spoon 
until of the consistency of cream, then gradually throw iq a handful 
of each ingredient, 2 eggs at a time ; when these ingredients are 
smoothly and thoroughly blended, cut the candied peels into strings 
and rub the cut orange and lemon peels' in sugar, and add these; 
then pour the paste into long tin baking pans, oiled with butter ; 
strew the preserves over the surface ; then, before putting them in the 
stove, shake some sugar over them. Bake a light brown. 

Note. The flour, sugar, eggs, brandy and salt should be gradually 
added to the butter. Nice bread for lunch, breakfast or informal 
occasions. 

ITALIAN BREAD No. i. One pound each of powdered loaf sugar and 
butter, i pound and 2 ounces flour, 12 eggs, 1-2 pound each of citron 
and lemon peeling ; mix as for pound cake. If the mixture begins 
to curdle, which it is most likely to do, because of the quantity of 
eggs, add a little flour. When the eggs are all used and it is light, 
stir in the remainder of the flour slightly. Bake it in long, narrow 
tins, either papered or buttered ; first put in a layer of the mixture 
and cover it with the peeling cut in thin slices. Proceed in this way 
until it is three-fourths full, and bake it in a moderate oyen. 

LOUISIANA BREAD. Work a little lard or butter into flour, ^add a 
few tablespoonfuls of yeast, according to strength, or a yeast 'cake 
dissolved in water and salt, then work up with tepid water. Hot 
water must never be used. Work to the consistency of biscuit 
dough. Set it to rise for several hours. If it burns before thoroughly 
done, fold a newspaper several times and lay over it. 

BREAD To KEEP MOIST. Place in the bread-pan aboard pierced 
with holes, and so -supported as to be a couple of inches from the 
bottom of the pan ; let there be an inch depth of water in the pan ; 
put the bread on the board and cover the pan with the lid. The in- 
closed air will prevent the bread from becoming too dry. 

THE BREAD I ATE AT HOME. Save a gill of bread dough made 
with yeast, cover it tightly and place it in a cool room or cellar until 
baking-day, then make a sponge of it by adding warm water and 
flour and a teaspoonful of sugar ; this should be done early ; in the 
evening, when the sponge is very light, mix the bread as usual with 
warm milk or water and a teaspoonful of soda or saleratus, and 
when light, bake. This always insures light, sweet bread, and entirely 
does away with yeast-making. Of course a piece of dough must be 
saved each time. 

BURN BREAK (Irish). The dough of 1-2 quarteen loaf, 2 ounces 
caraway seeds, 6 ounces sugar, 4 eggs and 1-4 pound of butter; 
work it all up together with as much flour as will make it of a proper 
consistency to bake. This takes half hour to do. Make into a round 
cake or loaf and bake. 



222 STALE BREAD. 

OUR OWN BREAJD. Set your sponge over night with i<2 pint of 
lukewarm water, i teaspoonful of yeast and i pint of flour (measure 
before sifting). In the morning add 1-2 cup of milk (in water with 
a little butter in it), and stir into the sponge with a spoonful of lime 
water and i pint of flour. Knead into 2 loaves and put them into 
pan to rise. Bake 1-2 hour. 

STALE BREAD. 

To RENEW OLD BREAD. Soak the bread in enough water to 
moisten it sufficiently to dampen it inside. Then put into a bake 
oven and heat very hot all through, even to bake it a little would 
not hurt it. Do not cover the oven. In this way old and dry bread 
may be made moist and good, no matter what kind, if it is not musty 
or moldy. 

To ECONOMIZE STALE OR SOUR BREAD, CRUST AND CRUMBS. Put 
them into a stove and bake them slowly for several hours ; then soak 
them ad make pudding and griddle cakes and even sponge cake. 
The sour bread should have a little salaratus added to the batter 
when it is used for that purpose to correct the acidity. N. B. Rich 
cake that has wine or brandy in it will keep several months if kept in 
a cool, dry place. The day before it is to be eaten put it in a cake 
pan and set it in a bake pan that has a cup of water in it. Set on the 
bake pan cover and let the cake bake till it is thoroughly heated. 
Let it be cold before it is eaten. 

USES OF STALE BREAD. When pounded or crumbled fine, and 
boiled milk poured over it, it is nice. These crumbs, mixed with an 
equal portion of stewed fruit and mixed well with common custard 
and baked, make an excellent light pudding or custard. The cust- 
ard, thickened with the crumbs without the fruit, forms a good pud- 
ding, or remnants of fish, meat or fowl chopped fine and mixed 
with such crumbs, with sufficient egg and a little butter, form a nice 
meat pudding when baked. It should be floured. This can also 
be dressed as hash with a little milk and water, salt and pepper in a 
stew pan, or fried in small balls. 

STALE BREAD EIGHT WAYS TO USE IT. i. To make dressing for 
meat, crumble fine, turn hot broth over it, season, add butter and a 
well-beaten egg or more, according to quantity. 2. To make bread- 
pudding, soak two hours in sweet milk, then beat in eggs, sugar, spices 
and bake ; fruit may be added if liked. 3. To make biscuit, soak 
over night in sour milk, work with the hands, mix with your biscuit 
for breakfast, adding salt, lard and soda ; they are better than with- 
out the stale bread. 4. To make pancakes 01 gems, soak 10 hours 
in sour milk, add well-beaten eggs, com meal or Graham flour 



STALE BREAD. 223 

to make a batter, add soda and salt and bake on a griddle or in 
gem pans. 5. Crumb fine and put in the next omelet you make. 6. 
Toast your bread ; set a pan of milk on the stove, but do not re- 
move the cream from it, add butter and salt, dip the bread in this 
and send to the table for supper or breakfast. 7. Crumb fine and 
put in your tomatoes when you are stewing them. 8. Pound fine, 
season and roll oyster or fish in them and fry in nice lard. 

How TO SAVE STALE BREAD. Stale bread may be made as nicely 
as if freshly-baked by dipping the loaf into clean cold water and 
warming thoroughly in a bakeoven. Much bread might be saved in 
this way. 

STALE BREAD can be renewed by putting it for 20 minutes in a hot 
stove or oven not too hot. It is best to put a damp cloth over it, 
or moisten the bread with cold water and let it remain in the stove 
or oven until the water is evaporated. 

To FRESHEN STALE BREAD. Dip the loaf wrapped in a clean 
cloth into boiling water for 1-2 a minute, then take off the cloth and 
bake the loaf for 10 or 15 minutes in a slow oven. 

BRKAD CRUMBS. Take a piece of the crust of a stale loaf, not 
too hard, put it in a cloth, bruise it well with your hand till it falls in 
crumbs, pass it through either a wire sieve or colander and use when 
required. 

To KEEP cold bread or cakes from becoming stale, keep them in 
a common terre cotta or pottery jar, with a close cover of the same 
over the top. The jar should be perfectly dry. This should be 
seen to. 

POTATO BREAD. 

VIRGINIA GRANGER POTATO BREAD. Boil the potatoes not quite 
so soft as common, then dry them a short time on the fire, peel them 
while hot and pound them as fine as possible ; next put small quan- 
tity of pearl ash to new yeast ; while it is working briskly add as 
much rye meal or flour as can be worked in ; mix the whole well to- 
gether, but do not add any water to it (but some butter or sweet 
lard if desired). After the dough is thus prepared let it stand an 
hour and a half or two hours before it is put in the oven. Observe 
it will not require so long baking as regular wheat bread. 

SWEET POTATO BREAD. Take the same dough of which you 
make your family bread, leaving out one-fourth of the flour, putting 
in the same quantity of Irish potatoes mashed very fine while hot, or 
more ; if sweet potatoes, in the same way. Work thoroughly till 
the potatoes are thoroughly incorporated, not forgetting a little lard 
or butter and salt. N. B. When swept potatoes are boiled add a 



224 POTATO BREAD. 

* 

piece of charcoal. If white Irish potatoes, add a pinch of soda. 
The soda or charcoal improves them very much. 

SWEET POTATO PONE (A Florida Recipe). Grate the sweet po- 
tatoes, 2 cups flour, sweeten with molasses, sugar or honey to taste. 
Bake a long time. May be eaten cold or warm. 

To MAKE GOOD HOMEMADE BREAD. One quart of flour, i 
large tablespoonful of solid brewer's yeast or nearly i ounce of fresh 
Get man yeast, i 1-4 to i 1-2 pints of milk and water. Put the flour 
into a large bowl or deep pan ; then with strong metal or wooden 
spoon hollow out the middle, but do not clear it entirely away from 
the bottom of the pan, as, in that case, the sponge (or leaven, as it 
was formerly termed), would stick to it, which it ought not to do. 
Next take either a large tablespoonful of brewer's yeast, which has 
been rendered solid by mixing it with plenty of cold water, (and 
letting it afterwards stand to settle a day and night) ; or nearly an 
ounce of German yeast; put it into a large basin, and proceed to 
mix, so that it shall be as smooth as cream, with 3-4 of a pint of 
warm inilk and" water, or with water only ; though even a very little 
milk will improve the bread. Pour the yeast into the hole made in 
the flour and stir into it as much of that which lies round it as will 
make a thick batter, in which there must be no lumps. Strew plenty 
of flour on the top, throw a clean, thick cloth over and set it where 
the air is warm, but do not place it upon the stove, for it will become 
too much heated there. Look at it from time to time ; when it has 
been lam for nearly an hour, and when the yeast has risen and broken 
through the flour, so that bubbles appear in it, you will know that it 
is ready to be made up into dough. Then place the pan on a strong 
chair, or dresser, or table, of convenient height; pour into the sponge 
the remainder of the warm milk and water; stir into it as much of 
of the flour as you can with the spoon ; then wipe it out clean with 
the fingers and lay it aside. Next take plenty of the remaining 
flour, throw it on the top of the leaven, and begin with the knuckles 
of both hands to knead it well. When the flour is nearly all kneaded 
in, begin to draw the edges of the dough towards the middle, in 
order to mix the whole thoroughly ; and when it is free from flour 
and lumps and crumbs, and does not stick to the hands whentouchd, 
it will be done, and may again be covered with the cloth and left to 
rise a second time. In 3-4 of an hour look at it, and should it have 
swollen very much and begin to crack, it will be light enough to bake. 
Turn it then into a pasteboard or very clean dresser, and with a sharp 
knife divide it in two, make it up quickly into loaves and dispatch 
them to the oven ; make one or two incisions across the tops of the 
loaves, as they will rise n>pre readily if this be done. If baked 
in tins or pans rub them with a tiny piece of butter laid on a, 



POTATO BREAD. 22$ 

^ 

piece of clean paper to prevent the dough from sticking to them. 
All bread should be turned up side down, or on its side, as soon as 
it is drawn from the oven. If this be neglected the under part of 
the loaves will become wet and blistered from the steam, which can- 
not then escape from them To make the dough without setting 
the sponge, merely mix the yeast with the gVeater part of the 
warm milk and water, and wet up the whole with flour at once 
after a little salt has been stirred in, proceeding exactly in every 
other respect as in the directions just given. As the dough will 
soften in the rising, it should be made quite firm at first, or it will 
be too lithe by the time it is ready for the oven. Time to be left to 
rise, i hour the first time ; 3-4 of an hour the second time ; to be 
baked from i to i 1-4 hours, or baked in one loaf from i i-a to a 
hours. 

OAT MEAL AND BUCKWHEAT CAKES. 

OAT MEAL CAKES (Scotch) FOR BREAKFAST. Put some oatmeal 
in a bowl or basin, take a pitcherful of boiling water, with a tea- 
spoonful of salt butter or melted lard in it, to make the cakes crisp ; 
pour this boiling hot over the meal, stirring as quickly as possi- 
ble into a dough, and then turning it out upon a baking board, 
upon which it is to be rolled till it is as thin as it will hold to- 
gether, when it is to be stamped into the form of small, round 
cakes. These are first to be placed on a griddle to make them 
firm, and afterwards toasted before the fire alternately on each 
side, till they are quite dry and crisp. 

BUCKWHEAT CAKES. One quart of buckwheat flour, one half 
cup yeast, one tablespoonful of salt, one and one-half basin water ; 
beat well with a large spoon ; let them rise over night ; in the 
morning add a teaspoonful of salaratus and fry. 

BUCKWHEAT CAKES No. 2. Three pints of buckwheat flour 
sifted, a little salt, 1-2 pint of cornmeal, 1-2 teacup of brewer's 
yeast or 4 large tablespoonfuls home-made yeast, and enough milk- 
warm water to make a batter. Mix all together, then make a hole 
in the middle of the meal and pour in the yeast. Then slowly add 
sufficient milk and warm water to make a thick batter after the yeast 
is added. Cover the vessel and let it rise for 3 hours. If it is cov- 
ered with bubbles and risen enough it is ready to bake. Have your 
griddle clean and hot. Tie a piece of batter in a clean white rag 
and grease the griddle well ; have a saucer near to put it in when 
not in use. Pour out a large ladleful on the griddle to bake ; when 
brown turn with the cake turner, and bake brown on the other side. 
Scrape the griddle smooth with a knife, 'wipe, and grease it between 



126 OAT MEAL AND BUCKWHEAT CAKES. 

baking each cake, and as fast as one is done butter it, and put it on 
the other in a hot plate. If the cakes are large cut them across in 
four pieces. Trim off the edges before sending them to the table,when 
re-buttered they can be re-battered if wished. If the batter has been 
made the night before and found sour in the morning,add 1-4 teaspoon 
of soda or saleratus dissolved in a little warm water; stir it in, and let 
it stand i hour before baking. The alkali will neutralize the acid, 
and increase the lightening of the batter. If soda be used, add t 
teaspoonful. The batter should not be allowed to freeze, as it will 
not be fit for use. No animal fat should be used to grease the 
griddle. 

INDIAN AND PUMPKIN CAKES. Stir an equal portion of cornmeal 
into an equal portion of stewed pumpkin that has been well mashed 
and drained in a cloth or collender, in a pan, adding the meal gra- 
dually; add 1-2 cup butter, mix thoroughly. If not stiff enough, 
add more meal to form a dough. Make it into cakes or loaves, 
Bake them on a hot griddle well greased,with butter, as for muffins, or 
in an iron pan, in an oven; bake them in loaves. Serve hot and eat 
with butter or milk 

RICE BREAD. 

RICE BREAD. Boil gently over a slow fire one pound and a half 
of rice till it becomes perfectly soft, then make into a paste by beat- 
ing it. While warm mix it into four pounds of flour, adding the 
usual quantity of yeast. Set it to rise in a warm place ; after divide 
it into loaves, and it will be found when baked to be very nice 
bread. 

RICE BREAD. Three teacups of rice flour, i of wheat flour, i 
heaping teaspoonful of cream tartar rubbed in the flour, 2 or 3 eggs 
well beaten, a tablespoonful of lard or butter, 1-2 teaspoonful of 
soda and sweet milk enough to make the batter smooth and of the 
consistency of pound cake. 

RICE PAN BREAD. Two tablespoonfuls of hot hominy, i spoon- 
ful of butter ; when cold, add 2 capfuls of rice flour, and make a 
batter with sweet milk and bake in a moderate oven. 

RICE AND WHEAT FLOUR BREAD. Simmer i Ib. rice in 1-2 gallon 
of water till it becomes perfectly soft ; when it is of proper warmth, 
mix it extremely well with 5 pounds of flour, 4 large spoonfuls of 
yeast. Knead it well, then set it to rise in a warm place or before 
the fire. Some of the flour should be reserved to make up the 
loaves. If the rice, in boiling, should swell so as to require more 
water, add it ; do not have the water too hot, but ptmr in gradually. 
Stir with a wooden or iron spoon so as to form a soft dough. Cover

the pan and set it away; if cold, by the fire. In the morning pour 
in another pint of warm water in which 1-2 teaspoonful of soda has 
been dissolved, so as to form a batter. Beat the batter hard, set it 
before the fire or stove for fifteen minutes before baking. Let the 
cakes be thin. Eat them hot with honey, butter, sugar or molasses, 

ITALIAN BREAD. Boil the rice flour or chestnut meal as oatmeal 
porridge, then turn it out on a dish and cut in slices with a twine 
string and serve for breakfast ; very nice. 

RICE CORN BREAD. Take one pint of well boiled rice, one pint 
of cornmeal, one ounce of butter, two eggs, one pint of sweet milk, 
two teaspoons of baking powder ; beat the eggs very light, then 
add the milk and melted butter ; beat the rice until perfectly smooth 
and add to the eggs and milk, Lastly, add the cornmeal ; beat all 
together until very light. 

EGG BREAD. Use from one to as many eggs well beaten as you 
can afford for the quantity of cornmeal designed to be used, or 3 
eggs to i quart, 1-2 cupful of fresh butter, salt to taste, i cup of 
milk or more, mix the eggs and milk together, gradually stirring in 
the meal", then add the salt and butter. It must be a thick batter, 
but thin enough to be stirred easily with a spoon. If too stiff more 
milk can be added; it must be beaten well to have all the ingredi- 
ents thoroughly blended. This can be put in a buttered tin or iron 
pan as one loaf, or they can be divided into smaller loaves. The 
oven should be moderately hot at first, and the heat increased after- 
wards. It should bake in proportion to thickness from 11-2 to 2 
hours. In baking good bread nothing has taken the place of the 
Dutch oven. The loaf can be cut at the table and eaten hot with 
butter, sugar or molasses. 

EGG WHEAT BREAD. Four cups flour, 2 cups cornmeal, 1.2 cup 
of butter or. lard, 4 eggs, salt to taste, one cup of new milk ; mix 
the eggs, butter, milk and salt and beat till light. Stir while gradu- 
ally adding the flour and meal, then bake in buttered pans as for egg 
bread. Bread can be made of coarse brown flour in the same 
way. 

AERATED BREAD No. i. A process has recently been patented for 
making bread "light" without the use of leaven. It is done by the ap- 
plication of machinery, by which means carbonic acid gas or fixed 
air is made to impregnate the bread. Thus the long and tedious 
and fatiguing manual process of kneading the dough in order that 
it might be thoroughly inter-penetrated with the leavening principle 
is set aside, thus emancipating the housewife and baker from a vast 
amount of labor. There are, however, different opinions about 
the bread, but why may not the process of bread making and 
baking undergo a change as well as other things, for wheat, corn,&c., 



228 RICE BREAD. 

were once reaped by the hands ? The only agents employed in the 
production of aerated bread by machinery are wheaten flour, salt, 
water and generated corbonic acid gas, which is the source of effer- 
vescence, and its action on the new bread takes the place of the old. 
It is the same gas, whether coming from aerated drinks or lemon- 
ade, in common water coming from the lowest excavations. 

In this aerated process the kneading is done by mixing the dougn 
in a great iron ball, inside of which is perpetually passing a system of 
peddles, a light nice looking dough is soon produced. This is caught 
in thus, and passed into the floor of the oven, which is an endless floor, 
when the loaves emerge from the other end of the apartment, when 
the aerated bread is done or made. NOTE It is sometimes a good 
plan to change one's baker from time to time, and so secure a 
change in the quality of the bread that is eaten. 

FRENCH APPLE BREAD. One-third warm pulp of apple, two-thirds 
of flour and the usual quantity, of yeast (the apples should be boiled) ; 
work all well together, then set to rise in a vessel to its utmost for 
eight or twelve hours ; then form into long, low loaves ; bake thor- 
ough in a moderate oven. 

N. B. Little or no water or milk is necessary ; add salt to taste ; 
eat hot with milk, butter or coffee. 

APPLE BREAD, RUSSTAN FASHION. (Mrs. B.) Put 11-2 cups of 
good white sugar fn 3 cups of water in a copper preserving pan with a 
round bottom ; set it on a quick fire and reduce it so that it will snap 
between your fingers ; having peeled and cut Into slices two dozen 
good, sound, ripe apples, put them into the sugar, stirring constantly 
till it becomes quite a thick marmalade ; remove it from the fire, pour 
it into a slightly oiled or buttered colander mould; shake it well 
down, then set it to cool, when turn it out on a dish, then melt in a 
stew-pan over the fire ; a few spoonfuls of currant jelly; add 2 glasses 
of old, good rum, and when partly cold pour over and serve with 
whipped cream in the center, in which you have placed 4 ounces of 
candied orange flowers. What remains over will make delightful 
croquettes. 

APPLE CORN BREAD. Two pints each of new corn meal and 
sweet milk, i quart of finely chopped mellow apples and a teaspoon- 
ful of salt. Bake in a quick oven ; eaten hot at any meal with but- 
ter, milk coffee or gravy. 

LEMON BREAD. (Mrs. Kull, of Hamburg.) Four whole eggs, the 
yolks of 4, i pound wet sugar, and lemon chopped very fine ; 4 oz 
citron chopped fine, 6 oz. flour well worked or beaten ; roll on a 
board thin ; cut out in shon and bake. * 

CHOCOLATE BREAD. (Mrs. Kull, of Hamburg.) Two eggs bea- 
ten to snow 1-2 pound sugar, 4 ounces chocolate, a little vanilla to 



RICE BREAD. 22Q 

flavor with sufficient flour to cut into form. Frost with sugar and 
bake in a moderate stove. 

MIXED BREAD. One half gallon of meal and i pint of bread 
sponge ; soak sufficiently to wet the whole; add i cup of flour and 
a tablespoonful of salt ; let it rise, then knead it well the second 
time, and place the dough in the oven and bake one hour and a 
half. 

CORN BREAD. A heaping cupful of corn meal, scald it with hot 
water, 2 cupfuls of cooked hominy, 2 eggs and a cupful of milk and 
some butter ; stir well, then butter and bake in a pan or shaper. 

PUMPKIN BREAD, Mash the cooked pumpkin very fine and strain 
through a colander, then work in either corn or wheat flour and add 
yeast as you would to wheat bread ; add a little butter or lard, work 
it thoroughly, then let rise, and bake as other bread. It is best to 
grease the pan before putting the dough in. 

BREAD SNOW RAISED. It has been discovered that snow incor- 
porated with flour or corn meal performs the same office as yeast or 
baking powder ; add enough snow, say a heaping spoonful into dry 
flour or meal, to which has been added a little butter and salt ; set 
in the oven at once and bake 3-4 hours. I speak from experi- 
ence. 

FOR BREAKFAST, CRACKLING OR SHORT CORN BREAD. Take the 
desired quantity of meal and cracklings or lard, accoading to the 
richness, a spoonful of salt (more or less), pour in warm water and 
knead the dough, then bake brown in a moderately hot oven. Not 
often eaten with butter, but it is excellent to eat with good coffee. 
Bake in small or large loaves not too hard. 

FINE FRENCH BREAD. Take i gallon of the finest flour, and, 
having well-sifted it into a kneading trough, form a ravity in the flour, 
into which strain i cupful of warm milk and the choicest yeast ; 
mix some of the surrounding flour so as to form a light sponge, 
then having covered it up with a linen and a flannel cloth, place it 
before the fire to lise for 45 minutes; and, having warmed i 1-2 
pints of milk with i cup of water, 1-4 pound of fresh butter, a spoon- 
ful of powdered sugar (loaf), and a little salt, knead it to a proper 
consistency and place it again before the fire. After once more 
kneading it and placing it to rise, form the dough into loaves, bricks 
or rolls of one size or shape and lay them on tin plates ; set them 
before the fire to rise for 20 minutes, and, having baked them in a 
quick oven, let the crust be rasped or chipped off while hot. Some 
persons put in butter and eggs, leaving out the whites. 

To MAKE A PECK OF GOOD BREAD. Three pounds of potatoes, 
6 pints uf coldwater, 1-2 pint of good yeast, i peck ot flour, 2 oz. 
of salt. Peel and boil the potatoes ; beat them to a cream while 



230 DUMPLINGS. 

warm ; then add i pint of cold water, strain through a colander and 
add to it 1-2 pint of good yeast, which should have been put in 
water over night to take off its bitterness. Stir all well together with 
a wooden spoon, and pour the mixture into the center of the flour; 
mix it to the consistency of cream, cover it over closely and let it 
remain near the fire for an hour ; then add the 6 pints oi water and milk 
warm with 2 oz. of salt ; pour this in and mix the whole to a nice, 
light dough. Let it remain for about 2 hours ; then make it into 7 
loaves and bake for about i 1-2 hours in a good oven. When baked 
the bread should weigh nearly 20 pounds. Bake 11-2 hours. 

SWIFT YEAST BREAD. -Grate 1-2 a dozen potatoes and add i quart of 
water; put in i cup of hop yeast at night, and in the morning, 
when light, add 3 teaspoonfuls of sugar, and flour to form a dough, 
when put it in tins ; let it rise again and bake for 1-2 an hour. 

DUMPLINGS. 

SUET AND CURRANT DUMPLINGS. Of grated bread 2 cupfuls, 2 of 
currants picked, washed and dried, 6 oz suet chopped very fine and 
put in a small portiqn of hot water, 3-4 of a cup of flour, a^great deal 
of grated lemon peeling, a bit of sugar and a little piminto in fine 
powder; mix with 2 eggs and a little milk into dumplings and fry of 
yellow brown in boiling lard or cotton seed oil. Made with flour 
instead of bread, but 1-2 the quantity, they are excellent. Serve 
with sweet sauce flavored to taste. 

APPLE DUMPLINGS. Make the paste as for pies, then pare and 
core nice, sound, ripe apples (on account of the flavor some prefer 
not to take the core out), inclose them in the dough paste and dip 
them into boiling water. They will soon be done, and should not 
be permitted to burst open. Eat them hot with sauce as for boiled 
dumplings. Flour stirred into boiling water, or the paste made with 
hot water, or with Irish potatoes and a little salt, is very good mashed 
to a cream while hot, and mixed with the flour and hot water form 
a paste without lard or butter. Eat with a rich sauce flavored with 
lemon peel. 

LEMON DUMPLINGS. Take the juice and rind of a lemon and 
1-2 pound of bread; grate both very fine, and add 1-2 pound of suet, 
chopped fine, 4 oz. moist sugar, mix all well together, put it in tea- 
cups tied on with cloths and boil them. 

YEAST DUMPLINGS. Make a very light dough with yeast, as for 
bread, but with milk instead of water, and put in salt ; let it rise an 
hour before the fire. Twenty minutes before you are to serve have 
ready a large stew-pan of boiling water ; make the dough into balls 
the st^q of a middling apple ; throw them in and boil ?Q minutes. 



DUMPLINGS. 231 

If you doubt whether done enough, stick a straw or clean knife or 
into one, and if it come out clean it is done. The way to eat them 
is to tear them apart at the top with two forks, for they become heavy 
by their own steam. Eat immediately with meat or sugar and but- 
ter or salt. 

CHARLESTON DUMPLINGS. Make a good, thick batter, as for pan- 
cakes, drop it into a sauce-pan of boiling water. When the dump- 
lings are done, which will be in 2 or 3 minutes, throw them into a 
sieve to drain, and then turn them into a dish. Eat with sugar and 
butter and grated lemon peel. 

SNOW DUMPLINGS. Pare and core several apples ; wash a pint of 
rice and roll the apples in it, so that the rice will adhere ; have ready 
a nice piece of pie crust, wrap the apples in a piece of the dough 
and roll the dumplings in rice again, and so on until you use up all 
the apples. Put a napkin in the steamer, place it over a pot of boil- 
ing water, put in the dumplings and steam till done. Eat with cream 
sauce. Mrs. Genett. 

CHERRY DUMPLINGS. Strew cherries on pie-paste rolled thin. The 
seeds may or may not be removed, then rolled up and boiled as for 
boiled lemon dumplings ; 1-2 pound grated bread, 1-4 each chop- 
ped suet and moist sugar, 2 eggs, i large lemon. Mix the bread, 
suet and moist sugar well together, adding the lemon peeling, which 
should be finely minced. Moisten with the eggs and strained lemon 
juice ; stir it well and put the mixture into small buttered cups. Tie 
them down and boil for 3-4 of an hour. Turn them out on a dish, 
strew sifted sugar over them and serve with wine sauce. Boil 3-4 
of an hour. Sufficient for 6 dumplings. Seasonable at any time. 

CORN MEAL DUMPLINGS. Make a thick dough of i pint of meal 
and scalding water, i spoonful of lard, a large pinch each of salt 
and soda. Put in a bag and boil i hour. Serve hot for dinner with 
gravy or meat. 

GREEN CORN DUMPLINGS. A quart of grated green corn or roast- 
ing ears, 1-2 pint of new milk or cream, i cup of flour, 2 cups of 
butter, 2 eggs, a pinch each of salt and pepper, and butter for frying. 
Mix the corn with the flour and add the salt and pepper. The corn 
should be grated very fine. Warm the milk and soften the butter in 
it, then add them gradually to the. pan of corn, stirring it very hard 
and set it away to cool. Beat the eggs till light, and stir them into 
the mixture when it has cooled. Flour your hands and roll it into 
little dumplings. Put into a frying-pan a sufficiency of lard or but- 
ter, or an equal proportion of both, and when it is boiling hot and 
has been skimmed, drop the. dumplings carefully in and fry them 10 
or 12 minutes in proportion to their thickness. 

Sue.'!' DUMPLINGS. Chop very fine i pound of beef suet ; mix 



232 DUMPLINGS. 

with i 1-2 pounds of flour, 2 eggs beaten separately, a little salt and 
just enough milk to make it. Make them flat as large as a coffee 
cup and as thick as you like, or roll them into balls and drop them 
in boiling water or into the boiling of beef, or you may roll the paste 
into a long dumpling and boil it in a cloth wrapped closely around 
it. Eat with sauce. 

BREAD AND SUET DUMPLINGS. Take 1-2 pound of grated bread, 
i - 2 pound of beef suet chopped very fine, the juice and grated rind of 
i lemon, 4 oz. of moist sugar and 2 eggs. Mix all together and make 
5 dumplings; boil them in cloths 1-2 an hour and serve with sweet, 
rich sauce. 

PASTE DUMPLINGS. The paste made as for boiled dumplings and 
rolled very thin, then put a mere trifle of butter over the paste and roll 
up and boil. Eat in the same manner with seasoned sauce as for 
boiled dumplings. 

BOILED DUMPLINGS.- -Beat the yolks of 6 eggs and the whites 
separately, as for pound cake, then add a little salt, flour, i cup of 
butter to the yolks of the eggs and stir till smooth ; then add the 
whites and more flour until it is stifl enough to be be rolled out with 
a rollingpin on a floured pasteboard; then roll it up and put it into 
a bag and wrap it closely, so that it may not spread. It is better to 
sew it in. Boil 3-4 of an hour. Unwrap it and lay it on a dish, 
slice and eat hot with a rich sauce also hot, or with a sauce of cream 
and sugar, or butter and sugar cold. Season to taste. 

HARD DUMPLINGS One pound of flour, 1-2 pint of water, 1-2 
teaspoonful salt. Mix the flour and water together to a smooth paste, 
previously adding a small quantity of salt. Turn this into small 
round dumpings; drop them into boing water and boil from 12 to 
3-4 of an hour. They may be served with roast or bored meat; in 
the latter case they may be cooked with the meat, but should be 
dropped into the water when it is quite boiling. Boil from 1-2 to 
3-4 of an hour. Sufficient for 10 or 12 dumplings. 

GREEN PEACH OR APPLE DUMPLINGS. The paste made as above. 
If the fruit be stewed, take a spoon or your hand and put it smooth- 
ly on the paste, and roll it up, or if used before cooking, Chop them 
first very fine and put the particles uniformly on the paste and roll 
up and boil. Any kind of marmalade, apple butter, preserves, jel- 
lies, sweetmeats or dried fruits chipped very fine, or raisins can be 
used in the same manner and eaten with the sauce desired. 

PANCAKES. 

FRENCH PANCAKES. Put in a basin 1-4 Ib. sifted flour, i egg, 1-4 
gill of milk ; stir to a smooth paste, then add 1-2 a pint of milk, i 
spoonful fresh butter, melted, and x small pinch of salt ; mix well 



PANCAKES. 233 

and if lumpy strain through the pointed strainer. Put a small piece 
of butter in a pancake pan ; when melted pour in 2 tablespoonfuls 
of the batter. Spread it so as to cover the pan entirely fry till color, 
ed on one side, then toss it over and cook the other side, and turn 
the pancake out on a dich. When all the batter is used in this way, 
sprinkle the pancakes with sugar and se'rve on a hot dish with a cut 
lemon. Pancakes should be eaten as soon as fried. 

COMMON PANCAKES. Take 4 spoonfuls of fine flour, 4 eggs well 
beaten together, then add i cup of milk, i cup of butter, then beat 
again. Fry them with lard or dripping. Sugar and lemon, molasses 
or sugar and vinegar should be served to eat with them ; or when 
eggs are scarce, make the batter with flour, small beer and ginger, 
or clean snow, with flour and a very little milk will serve, but not as 
well as eggs. 

CALIFONIA PANCAKES. Beat 10 eggs with a little of the best 
brandy, and i pound of the best flour; mix 12 ounces of butter 
melted in a pint of cream or rich new sweet milk, a little salt and 
nutmeg; when almost cold mix all together with 3-4 cup of fine su- 
gar and fry them in a dry pan without the addition of fat. Let the 
pan be hot when you begin ; when you begin fry them only on one 
side; as you lay them on the dish strew powdered sugar between 
each pancake, and when they are all done turn them upside down 
in another dish, that the brown side may be uppermost. Sprinkle 
fine sugar over that and garnish with cut lemon. 

FIRST RATE CORN BREAD. Known in the South as egg bread. 
Pour enough boiling water on a quart of white corn meal to make 
an ordinary mush ; add 5 well beaten eggs, a quarter of a pound of 
butter, or the same quantity of lard and butter mixed - a pint and a 
half of milk, two cupfuls of boiled grits or small hominy. Stir all 
together until it is perfectly smooth, and it must be about as stiff as 
batter ; bake it slowly in shallow tin pans. This quantity is enough 
for a large family. Mrs. James D. Thompson. 

To MAKE PANCAKES. Eggs, flour, milk ; to every egg allow i 
ounce of flour, about i-4th pint of milk, i pinch of salt ; be certain 
that theaeggs are fresh ; break each one separately in a cup, whisk 
them well, put them into a basin with the flour and the salt and a 
few drops of milk, and beat the whole to a perfectly smooth batter ; 
then add by degrees the remainder of the milk. The proper hin of 
the latter ingredient must be regulated by the size of the eggs, 
&c., &c., but the batter, when ready for frying, should be of the con- 
sistency of thick cream. Place a small frying pan on the fire to get 
hot; let it be delicately clean, or the pancakes will stick, and when 
quite hot put in a small piece of butter, allowing 1-2 ounce to each 
pancake. When it is melted pour in the butter, about 1-2 teacupful 



234 PANCAKBS. 

batter to a pan 5 inches in diameter, and fry about 4 minutes, or un- 
til it is nearly brown on one side. By only pouring in a small quan- 
tity of batter, and so making the pancake thin,the necessity of turning 
them (an operation rather difficult to some skillful cooks), is avoided. 
When the pancake is done, sprinkle over it some pounded sugar, 
roll it up in the pan and take it oui with a large slice and place it on 
a dish before the fire. Proceed in this manner until sufficiently 
cooked for a dish ; then send them quickly to table, and continue to 
send in a further quantity, as pancakes are never good unless eaten 
almost immediately as they come from the frying pan. The batter 
may be flavored with a little grated lemon rind, or the pancake may 
have preserves rolled in them instead of sugar. Send sifted sugar 
and a cut of lemon to table with them. To make pancakes fry 
light, the yolks and whites of the eggs should be beaten separately 
arjd the whites added the last thing to the batter before frying. From 
3 to 5 minutes for a pancake that does not require turning ; from 5 
to 8 minutes for a thicker one. Allow 3 eggs with the other ingre- 
dients in proportion for 3 persons. Seasonable at any time, but es- 
pecially served on Shrove Tuesday. 

PANCAKE BATTER may be made in the same way. Eggs, if not 
well beaten, makes the batter tough. 

PANCAKE WITH MARMALADE. Put 4 ounces of sifted flour into a 
basin with 4 eggs; mix them together very smoothly, then add 1-2 
cup of milk or cream and a little grated nutmeg; put a piece of but- 
ter in your pan (it requires just a little); when quite hot put in two 
tablespoonfuls of the mixture and let it spread all over the pan; 
place it upon the fire, and when colored upon one side turn it over; 
then turn it upon your cloth. Proceed thus till they are all done, 
then spread apricot or other marmalade over and roll them up 
neatly; lay them upon a baking sheet; sifted sugar over; glaze nicely 
with a salamander and serve upon a napkin. The above may be 
served with sugar, molasses, syrup or honey with the marmalade. 

RICE PANCAKES. To a half a pound of rice put nearly 2 cups of 
cold water and boil to a jelly; take off and work to a pulp with a 
wooden spoon; as soon as cold put this into 8 well beaten ggs, 2 
cups of cream, 1-2 pound of melted butter, a little salt and nutmeg; 
beat it till of a smooth batter, adding the butter last. Fry in as little 
sweet lard or cotton seed oil as possible. 

RICE PANCAKES. Boil 1-2 pound of rice to a jelly with a little 
water, and when cold mix with it a pint of cream, 8 eggs, a small 
matter of salt and some nutmeg. Stir in 1-2 pound of batter just 
warmed and as much flour as will thicken the batter. Fry them 
in very little leaf lard or drippings or cotton seed oil. 

CREAM PANCAKES. Mix the yolks of two eggs with 1-2 pint of 



MEAT AND SAVORY PUDDINGS. 235 

cream, 1-2 cup sugar, some cinnamon beating, mace and nutmeg; 
fry them as quick as pQssible and grate over them some lump 
sugar. 

PANCAKES. Beat whites of 4 eggs, the yolks of two, flour, salt 
into a smooth batter; then beat to a froth 8 or 10 eggs with 3 
ounces of sugar; fry in a pan on the top of the stove one or two 
minutes, and place on the fried pancake and serve hot. 

JELLY PANCAKES. Make a batter of 6 eggs and a pint of flour ; 
add a teaspoonful of salt, enough sweet milk to make a smooth bat- 
ter, beat thoroughly and fry with sweet lard; when one is done and 
taken up, spread on a plate; on this spread jelly or jam thinly, then 
roll up like a scroll; place on a napkin on a hot plate; put the pan- 
cake on when you have enough served. 

PINK PANCAKES. Boil, till tender, a large blood beet root, bruise 
it in a marble mortar, put to it the yolks of 4 eggs, 2 spoonfuls of 
flour, 3 of cream, 1-2 grated nutmeg, sugar to taste, a glass of 
brandy; mix well together; fry them carefully in a frying pan slightly 
greased with a tittle sweet lard. Serve them up with a garnish of 
green sweet meats. A mite of cochineal may serve for coloring. 

MEAT AND SAVORY PUDDINGS. 

LIVER PUDDINGS. Wash and thoroughly clean the entrails; boi! 
the liver till it will grate or pound ; take an equal quantity of minced 
suet and liver, chop an onion or two, season with black pepper, salt 
and a little thyme rubbed small ; half-fill the entrails, cut them into 
proper lengths and fasten the ends. Let them boil a little and prick 
them to keep them from bursting, When done* lay them to cool ; 
broil and serve them at table. The French prepare many delicacies 
expensive, and different puddings in skins, but with more trouble 
than our mode of making them. 

MUTTON PUDDING. Season with salt, pepper and a small onion ; 
lay one layer of steaks at the bottom of the dish and pour a batter 
of potatoes boiled and pressed through a colander and mixed with 
milk and an egg over them ; then put in the rest of the steaks and 
batter and bake them. Batter, with flour instead of potatoes, eats well, 
but requires more eggs, and is not so good. 

MUTTON PUDDING, No. 2. Cut slices of the leg of mutton that 
has been underdone and put them into a basin lined with a fine 
suet crust ; season with pepper, salt and finely-chopped onion or 
shalot. 

PORK PUDDING. The cuttings of pork which are spared when 
the pig is to be salted, which are quite lean, are best for a pudding. 
Take 11-2 Ibs. of the meat, seasoned with a teaspoonful of salt, 1-3 



236 MEAT AJ&D SAVORY PUDDINGS. 

as much pepper, a teaspoonful each of chopped onion, sage and ap- 
ple. Put into the paste with 1-2 a pint of water. Tie up and boil 
i 1-2 or 2 hours. 

POTATO PUDDING WITH MEAT. Boil the potatoes till fit to mash ; 
rub through a colander and make a thick batter with milk and 2 eggs; 
lay some seasoned steaks in a dish, then some batter, and over the 
last layer put the remainder of the batter. Bake a fine brown. 

MOTHER EVE'S PUDDING. Grate 3-4 lb. bread, mix it with the 
same quantity of suet chopped fine, the same of apples and currants; 
mix with these the whole of 4 eggs and the rind of 1-2 a lemon 
(hopped fine. Put it into a shape ; boil 3 hours and serve with 
pudding sauce the juice of 1-2 a lemon and a little nutmeg. 

CHEESE PUDDING. Mix together 1-2 lb grated cheese, 4 eggs 
well-beaten, and 1-2 pint of milk. Mix well and serve with a little 
salt. Bake in a buttered dish, putting some slices of toasted bread 
at the bottom of the dish, or omit them as you may fancy. 

HUNTER'S PUDDING. Mix i lb. each of suet, flour, currants, 
raisins stoned, cut up the rind of 1-2 a lemon pared as 
fine as possible ; 6 Jamaica peppers in fine powder, 4 eggs, a glass 
of brandy, a little salt, and as little milk as will make it to a proper 
consistency ; boil in a floured cloth or lemon mould 8 or 9 huurs. 
Serve with sweet sauce. Add sometimes a spoonful of peach brandy 
for change of flavor. This pudding will keep, after it is boiled, six 
months, if kept tied up in the same cloth and hung up, folded in a 
sheet of cap paper to preserve it from dust, being first cold. When 
to be used it must be boiled a full hour. 

BLACK PUDDING Take i 1-2 pints of pig's blood; add to it 1-2 
pint of boiled cream, i lb. of the inside fat of the pig, cut into small 
slices ; cut 3 onions also in slices and fry them in 2 oz. butter till of 
a yellow color ; season with i oz. salt, a small pinch of pepper, a 
little grated nutmeg, a sprig of thyme and 1-2 a bay leaf, chopped 
very fine; mix all well together, and fill the skins, previously well- 
cleaned and washed, with this mixture, raking care not to have the 
skins so full not to allow of tying them with a string into 5-inch 
lengths. When thus tied put them in a large stew-pan of boiling 
water, and without boiling them, let them remain therein till firm ; 
take them out and hang them to cool. When wanted they should 
be cut into lengths, well scored with a knife to prevent breaking, and 
broiled on a medium fire for 10 minutes, turning them over after 
5 minutes' broiling, then serve very hot. 

FRENCH BLACK PUDDING. Boil 12 onions in. broth with parsely, 
young onions, basil, thyme, sage and a bay leaf; chop them very 
fine; take 2 quarts of blood that has been properly taken from the 
throat of the hog or other animal ; put in a little vinegar to prevent

it from curdling ; cut i 1-2 rounds of the caul in slices ; put it into 
the blood with 2 quarts of cream, hash fine herbs, fine pepper, spices 
and salt. Mix all together; take the chittlings of hogs or sheep, 
which must be well scraped and cleaned, fill them with a filler, but 
do not make them too full, otherwise they might break ; tie them in 
proper lengths ; put them into a pot of warm warm water, and do 
them over a slow fire to prevent their breaking ; turn them carefully 
with a skimmer ; if they are pricked and the fat comes out they are 
sufficiently done. Take them up on a cloth and let them cool. 
When they are to be sent to the table slit and grill them. 

WHITE HOG'S PUDDING. Take 4 Ibs. beef suet shreded fine, 3 Ibs. 
of grated bread and 2 Ibs. of currants picked and washed, i tea- 
spoonful each of finely beaten cloves, mace and cinnamon, salt, i 1-2 
Ibs. sugar, i pint of wine, i quart of cream, some rosewater, and 20 
well-beaten eggs, using only half the whites. Mix these well and fill up 
the cleaned, well-washed and soaked entrails, boil them a little and 
prick them, take them up when done and lay them away or hang 
them up to dry. 

ClNDONILLES, OR CHITTLINGS, A LA BECHAMILLE. Put a bit of 

butter into a stew-pan, with a slice of ham, 3 large shalots, parsley, 
young onions, a clove of garlics, thyme, basit and bay ; put them 
upon a slow fire; let them sweat 1-4 of an hour; moisten with 
a quart of milk; let them boil and reduce one-half; pass it through 
a search ; put in a large handful of the crumbs of bread and make 
boil until the crumbs have taken up all the milk ; cut fillets of fresh 
pork, caul, bits of lard, and veal lights, head and sweetbread ; mix all 
with the bread and 6 eggs, fine spices and salt, fill the puddings or 
entrails ; tie and cook them in 1-2 milk and 1-2 fat broth, salt, pep- 
per and a bunch of parsely and young onions. Serve as directed for 
pig's chittlings. 

VEAL CHnTLiNGS. Take a veal's fraise or pluck (lights, heart 
and sweetbread), blanch or parboil them 15 or 20 minutes and cut 
them up in small pieces and add i Ib. of fat cut in the same manner; 
mix the whole with salt, fine spices, some shalots, 4 spoonfuls of rich 
cream and the yolks of 4 eggs ; use pig's puddings or entrails and sim- 
mer them in rich broth, a bottle of white wine, a clove of garlic, thyme, 
basil, bay and a bunch of parsley and young onions ; let them cool 
in their seasoning. Nick them a little ; grill and serve. 

FISH PUDDING. Pound some cold fish in a mortar with a few 
spoonfuls of broth ; add a small lump of butter and some crumbs 
of bread ; mix it with the yolks of 4 eggs previously well beaten 
and rub it through a sieve into a basin with the whites of the eggs 
also. 



238 MEAT AND FOWL PUDDING. 



MEAT AND FOWL PUDDING. 

HASHED FOWL PUDDING. Boil 12 onions and make a very dry 
panada of cream ; put the onions with it into a mortar, adding sweet 
almonds that have been put through a search ; mix all together ; 
add some raw yolks of eggs, put, cut into squares, white roasted 
fowls hashed very fine; pound all together and moisten with warm, 
rich cream, season with salt and fine spices ; taste if it is good, and 
fill the skins. These do not require as much cooking as the black 
pudding. Instead of water use milk. Let them cool and prick 
them with a fork, instead of cutting, before they are put upon the 
grill. The best manner of doing them is to put them into a white pa- 
per case and broil them. 

BAKED CHICKEN PUDDING. Cut up 2 or more young chickens as 
for frying. Stew them till half-done in a small quantity of water, 
then take the chickens up to cool, and the liquor also ; meanwhile 
get ready a batter of 6 or 7 eggs, 2 pints of milk, i Ib of flour and 
some salt. Beat thoroughly till smooth; then fill up a baking-pan 
or dish with a layer of chicken and batter alternately. Let the top 
layer be of batter. Bake till done of a light brown ; then pour the 
chicken gravy into a sauce-pan, on the stove, stirring into it an egg 
as it boils. 
Serve at once in a sauce-tureen. With the pudding it is excellent. 

LARK AND BEEFSTEAK PUDDING. Make a paste with 3-4 of a Ib. of 
dry beef suet chopped fine and i Ib. of flour, with a little lard or butter, 
then make into a stiff paste with cold water or lukewarm milk; work 
it well, rolling it out 2 or 3 times with the rollingpin, or omit it, as it 
will then" be lighter for pudding. Then take 6 or 8 larks and roast 
them; take off the flesh and pick out the sinews, break the bones 
and put them in a stew-pan and hash them with the livers and flesh 
and nice beefsteak, with a little suet, if approved, an onion or two ; 
then put a layer of the paste in the bottom of the dish ; then put in 
the hash, with milk and butter, a little black pepper; cover the 
whole basin with the suet paste ; pinch the edges to keep the gravy 
in, and let it bake slowly for 2 hours or more 

RABBIT PUDDING. Roast a young rabbit or squirrel; take off the 
flesh, pick out the sinews, hash it with the liver very fine, break the 
bones and put them into a stew-pan, moisten with rich panada gravy 
seasoned ; let it boil to draw the flavor, with which a panada is to be 
made ; pound the meat and panada together, add 1-3 butter, 
that is to say, an equal part of the three ingredients, and fine minced 
onions that have been stewed in gravy, 6 raw yolks of eggs, rich 
cold cream, as much as necessary to make the whole to the con- 



MEAT AND FOWL PUDDING. 230 

sistency of pudding ; add fine spices, salt, pepper and nutmeg ; mix 
all well together, and fill the skins and tie and put them in a white 
paper case before they are put upon the grill. 

ENGLISH BEEFSTEAK PUDDING. From a Temple Bar Cook. 
(Olive Logan.) Make a crust of 1-2 pound suet chopped fine, i Ib. 
of flour, 1-2 spoonful of salt, a teaspoonful of baking powder 
mixed together and sufficient cold water added to make a stiff paste. 
2d, cut 1-2 of the paste for the cover of the pudding basin in which 
the pudding is to be boiled; roll the rest of the paste to the size 
required to line the pudding basin; grease the basin with butter and 
lay the paste in neatly. 3d, take 2 pounds of beef cut in slices; dip 
each slice in flour as you lay it in the basin, along with 2 kindings 
also sliced; a little chopped parsley, a bit of good butter the size of 
an egg, a few drops of Worcester sauce, a teacupful of water, 1-2 
spoonful each of salt and pepper, 4lh, Roll out the paste 
cover to the size of the top of the basin, then lay the cover on and 
press the edges together; dip your nice clean pudding cloth in boil- 
ing water, flour it, tie it over the top of the basin. 5th, place the 
basin in a saucepan of boiling water and keep boiling 4 hours. For 
serving take off the cloth, turn the basin over a nice warm plate and 
remove the basin. This leaves your pudding the round pudding 
shape on top, though the bottom is flat. When you stick your spoon 
in the gravy it will run out luscious and healthy, and the meat within 
be as tender as a young chicken. I should perhaps mention that the 
pudding basin referred to is a bowl of crockery holding a quart with 
a thick rim around the top, which makes it easy to tie the cloth on 
with a string. Enough for four persons. 

BAKED BEEFSTEAK PUDDING. Make a batter of milk, 2 eggs and 
flour, or which is better, potatoes boiled and mashed through a col- 
lender; lay a little batter on the bottom of the dish, then put in the 
steaks prepared as above and very well seasoned; pour the remainder 
of the batter over them and bake it. 

BOILED STEAK OR KIDNEY PUDDING. If made of kidney split and 
soak it and season that or the meat. Make a paste of suet, flour 
or cotton seed oil and milk, roll it, and line a basin with some; put 
the kidneys or steaks in, cover it with paste, and pinch round the 
edge. Cover with a cloth and boil a considerable time. It should 
be well seasoned with pepper, salt; butter, cream, fillets of fat pork 
or bacon or sweet lard. 

SUET PUDDING (English.) Two pounds of flour or bread crumbs, 
i pound of chopped beef suet, i or 2 eggs, a pinch of salt, i gill of 
milk or water, and i cup of sugar or honey if wished. This prepar- 
ation of ingredients will do for a large family, and can be propor- 
tioned to suit the number of persons to be served. Stir up the flour 



240 SWEET PUDDINGS. 

and minced suet together, then whisk the eggs and add them with a 
little salt to the minced suet and flour, then the water or milk, and 
make a paste with a strong wooden spoon; then dust your pudding 
bag or cloth with flour; lay your paste into it and sew or tie the cloth 
tight, and lay it into boiling water; when done, after boiling 11-4 
hour, plunge the bag into cold water a moment, then serve very hot 
by turning it out on a hot dish. If desired, eat with any kind of sweet 
sauce. 

OAT MEAL AND SUET PUDDING. Chop fine 1-2 pound of suet, add 
2 pounds of oat meal, an onion or 2 sliced, season with pepper and 
salt, and fill the skins or entrails as before. The oat meal should 
be dried well before using. 

FRUIT AND SUET PUDDING. Mince an equal quantity of beef 
suet and apples, grate some stale bread, pick and wash some dried 
currents, i pound raw sugar, nutmeg and cinnamon, and grate a piece 
of lemon peel. All to taste. Mix them well and fill the entrails; 
boil i-half hour and take them out to drain and then hang them up 
to dry. When wanted for use, put them first into boiling water, and 
then on a gridiron. 

VE\L SUET PUDDING. Cut the crumb of a 5 cent loaf into slices; 
boil and sweeten 1-2 gallon of new milk and pour over it. When 
soaked pour out a little of the milk and mix with 6 eggs well beaten 
and 1-2 nutmeg. Lay the slices of bread into a dish, with layers of 
currants and veal suet chopped fine, i pound each. Batter the dish 
well and bake; or if you prefer it, you may boil it in a basin. 

SUET PUDDING. Chop very fine i pound of suet, mix with 1-4 
pound of flour, 2 eggs beaten separately, a little salt and as little 
milk as will make it. Boil 4 hours. It eats well next day cut in 
slices and broiled on a pan or broiler. The outward fat of loins or 
necks of mutton finely chopped, makes a more delicious pudding 
than the suet. 

SWEET PUDDINGS. 

AN UNRIVALLED PLUM PUDDING. One-half pound of superior 
raisins, 1-4 pound of currants, i pound of Sultana raisins, 2 pounds 
of the finest moist sugar, 2 pounds of bread crumbs, 16 eggs, two 
pounds of finely chipped suet, 6 ounces of mixed candied peel, the' 
rind of two lemons, i ounce of ground nutmeg, i ounce of ground 
cinnamon, 1-2 oz. of pounded bitter almonds, 1-4 pint of brandy. 
Stone and cut up the raisins, but do not chop them; wash, pick and 
-dry the currants, and cut the candied peel into thin slices ; mix all 
the dry ingredients well together and moisten wlith the eggs, which 
should be well beaten and strained to the pudding; stir in the bran-

dy, and when all is thoroughly mixed, well butter and flour a stout 
new pudding cloth; put in the pudding and tie it very tightly and 
closely; boil from six to 8 hours, and serve with brandy sauce, a few 
sweet almonds, blanched and cut in strips, and stick on the pud- 
ding; ornament it prettily. This quantity may be divided and boiled 
in flattened moulds. For small families this is the most desirable 
way. as the above will be found to make a pudding of rather large 
dimensions. Boil from 6 to 8 hours; seasonable in winter; sufficient 
for 12 or 14 persons 

SNOW BA.NK SAUCE FOR PLAIN PUDDING. Put two tablespoon- 
fuls of flour and 4 ounces of butter into a clean saucepan, stir them 
over the fire till the butter melts and thickens; add 4 oz. pounded 
white sugar, i pint of good white wine or Madaira and stir it to the 
yolks of 8 eggs, which have been previously well whisked; keep con- 
stantly stirring until it gets quite hot; do not let it boil, or it will 
curdle. When sufficiently cooked, add the whites of the eggs pre- 
viously beaten to a stiff froth and thoroughly stirred into the mix- 
ture. Its appearance resembles a snow. 

PLUM PUDDINGS. Four ounces of pounded pudding biscuits, 2 
spoonfuls of the best flour or good common biscuits, 1-2 pound of 
good California raisins stoned and cut up; 1-2 Ib. dried currants 
picked and washed, 1-2 pound suet stripped of skins and threads and 
chopped fine, an even teaspoonful of grated nutmeg, 4 oz. of beaten 
sugar, 1-2 teaspoonful of cinnamon and 2 blades of mace beaten 
fine, 3 ounces each of candied lemon, orange and citron sliced, and 2 
oz. of blanched almonds roughly chopped. Beat 4 eggs well and put 
them to a little milk (sweet), a glass of wine or brandy, and then 
mix in the flout and all the ingredients. Tie up the pudding firm 
and boil it for 4 hours, keeping up the boiling by adding boiling 
water and turning the cloth over. Serve with pudding sauce. 

ENGLISH PLUM PUDDING. -Mrs. M.Jeanson. One-half pound each 
flour and bread crumbs mixed lightly together, 3-4 pound beef suet 
chopped fine, 1-2 pound each of raisins and currants well washed, 
picked and dried, a pinch each of powdered cinnamon and grated 
nutmeg, mace and cloves, 2 ounces citron chopped small, i Ib. 
brown sugar, 10 whole eggs beaten up; put the whole in a bowl, and 
after it is well mixed let it remain all night. The next morning stir all 
up again; scald a cloth, wring it out, then dredge it well with sugar or 
flour, put in the pudding, roll up and tie tight, put into a pot of boil- 
ing water, to which a handful of salt has been added, and a plate 
at the bottom of the pot. When first put in turn the pudding occa- 
sionally until it is wet, to prevent the raisins from settling on one 
side. Boil 2 hours quickly. If done slowly the pudding becomes 
heavy.

2 hours scalded. 

NOTE In all boiled puddings the cloth should be wet in boil- 
ing water before placing the pudding in, and before turning it out 
dip in cold water. This process will prevent it from sticking. 

SAUCE FOR MRS. MARY JEANSON'S ENGLISH PLUM PUDDING OR FOAM 
SAUCE. One half Ib. of butter, 2 cups white sugar powdered. These 
should be beaten together to a cream; 1-2 teacup each warm water 
and brandy to flavor. Stir to a foam; a most delicious sauce. 

NOTE To make hot brandy sauce, the whole should be boiled a 
little and the brandy added while hot. 

BOILED PLUM PUDDING. Stone and cut, but do not chop, i 1-2 Ibs. 
good Muscatel raisins, and cleanse without cutting i Ib. Sultana rais- 
ins ; wash and dry 2 Ibs. of Zante currants; cut into small, thin slices 
1-2 Ib mixed candied peel, grate the rinds of 2 lemons and i oz. nut- 
meg ; add i oz. ground cinnamon, 1-2 oz. pounded bitter almonds, 
2 Ibs. of finely chopped suet and 2 Ibs of bread crumbs ; mix these 
ingredients well together, dry. Beat the yolks of 16 eggs and 2 Ibs. 
of sugar to a froth : beat separately the whites of the eggs to a solid 
froth ; when this is done, stir i gill of brandy into the dry ingredients, 
add quickly the beaten yolks and whites, a little at a time, alternately; 
beat the whole rapidly together till well mixed. Butter well and flour 
a stout new pudding-cloth or a pudding-mould ; put in the pudding, 
tie down very tightly and closely. Boil 8 hours. Serve with brandy 
or lemon sauce. This pudding is enough for fourteen persons. 

BAKED PLUM PUDDING. Two Ibs. of flour, i Ib. of currants, i Ib. 
of raisins, i Ib. of suet, 2 eggs, i pint of milk, a few slices of can- 
died peel. Chop the suet finely, mix it with the flour, currants, 
stoned raisins and candied peel ; moisten with the well-beaten eggs, 
and add sufficient milk, to make the pudding of the consistency of 
very thick batter. Put it into the buttered dish and bake in a good 
oven from 2 1-3 to 2 3-4 hours, turn it out, strew sifted sugar over 



SWEET PUDDINGS. 243 

it and serve. For a very plain pudding, use only 1-2 the quantity of 
fruit ; omit the eggs and substitute milk or water for them. The 
above ingredients make a large family pudding ; for a small one, 
one-half the quantity will be found ample ; but it must be baked 
quite i 1-2 hours; large pudding, bake 2 1-2 to 2 3-4 hours; one- 
half the size, i 1-2 hours. Sufficient for 9 to 10 persons. Season- 
able in winter. 

SIMPLE SAUCE FOR ENGLISH PLUM PUDDING (Mrs. Jeanson). 
Equal quantities of sugar and butter beaten to a foam ; mix together 
a cupful of hot water and 2 spoonfuls of brandy. Put the sugar and 
butter mixed in a bqat or bowl, then pour into it the brandy and 
water and stir it vigorously only once. It foams and looks like snow. 
Pour brandy over and dredge sugar over the pudding when about to 
serve at table ; then set it on fire with a match. It is perfectly de- 
licious. It is what it ought to be, a snow sauce. 

PLUM PUDDING (Mrs. Cordova, West Indies). Twelve eggs 
well beaten, i Ib. white sugar, i Ib. flour, i Ib. butter, i Ib. raisins; 
the sugar and butter must be well stirred together, and after the eggs 
are beaten, then put them in and stir again, using some flavoring ; 
boil or bake. Note. Currants may be used in the same way, in- 
stead of the raisins or plums. 

PLUM PUDDING (Mrs. E. J. Jackson, Richmond, Va.). Take i 
quart of leavened dough from yeast bread in the morning. Set it 
aside until it is nearly time to put it on for dinner, then add a large 
teaspoonful of brown sugar, i Ib. of stoned raisins and two or three 
handfuls of well-washed, picked and dried currants, or the currants 
may be omitted. Bake. Dried whortleberries are very nice to add 
if fancied. 

A GRANGER'S currant or dried currant pudding can be made in 
the same way as the above. When done, all boiled puddings should 
be dipped into cold water for a moment and allowed to stand a min- 
ute; take up and turn out on a dish. Eat with wine or brandy 
sauce. 

POUND PLUM PUDDING. One Ib. suet, i of currants, i of stoned 
raisins, 8 eggs, 1-2 grated nutmeg, 2 oz. sliced lemon peel, i tea- 
spoonful of ground ginger, 1-2 Ib. of bread crumbs to 1-2 Ib. of flour, 
1-2 pint milk. Chop the suet finely; mix it with the dry ingredi- 
ents ; stir these well together and add the well-beaten eggs and milk 
to moisten with ; beat up the mixture well, and should the above 
proportion of milk not be found sufficient to make it of the proper 
consistency, a little more should be added. Press the pudding into 
a mould, tie it in a flannel cloth and boil for 5 hours, or rather longer, 
and serve with brandy sauce. Sufficient for 7 or 8 persons. Seas- 
ooable in winter. It may be baked for 2 hours intead of boiled. 



244 SWEET PUDDINGS. 

PLUM PUDDING WITH RUM. Take 2 peeled, large, ripe and plump 
apples, cut in small* squares ; 3-4 Ib. bread crumbs, 3-4 Ib. of picked 
and finely-chopped suet, 3-4 Ib. each of powdered sugar, 3-4 Ib. of 
well-washed and picked currants, 1-4 Ib. of candied orange peel and 
citron cut in small slices, 3-4 Ib of seeded raisins and the grated peel 
of a lemon. Mix the whole thoroughly in a basin with three 
pounded cloves, a pinch of salt, 6 eggs, i at a time, and 2 spoonfuls 
of rum. Butter a pudding mould ; fill it with the mixture and tie a 
cloth tightly over it. Fill a boiling pot 3-4 full of boiling water; put 
the pudding in it and boil for 3 or 4 hours, keeping the pot replen- 
ished with boiling water. Turn the pudding out of the mould on 
a hot dish ; sprinkle the dish with powdered sugar, pour in i glassful 
of warm rum and light it after putting the pudding on the table. 

PLUM PUDDING WITH WINE SAUCE. Prepare the pudding as be- 
fore. For the sauce, put 8 yolks of eggs in a stew-pan, with i cup 
of finely-pounded sugar, i 1-2 cups of superior California wine and 
1-3 the grated peel of a lemon; stir over the fire until the sauce 
coats the spoon, strain through a fine cloth or hair sieve, and 
serve the sauce in a boat with the pudding. 

RICH PLUM PUDDING. One Ib. of flour, dried, i Ib. of currants 
very carefully picked, washed and dried before the fire ; i Ib. of 
stoned and chopped raisins, i Ib. of beef suet or marrow picked very 
fine, 8 eggs, the whites and yolks beaten separately and thoroughly and 
well-mixed with the flour before any other ingredients are added ; i 
oz. of candied citron chopped very fine, 2 oz. blanched almonds cut 
in pieces, a nutmeg and a little new milk or water the less the bet- 
ter of either ; the milk will make it cut more solid ; but the water 
will make it more light and hollow. Let it boil 4 hours and serve 
with sugar sifted over, and wine sauce. 

CHRISTMAS PLUM PUDDING. One-half Ib. raisins, 1-2 Ib. currants, 
1-2 Ib. mixed peel, 3-4 Ib. bread crumbs, 3-4 Ib. suet, 8 eggs, i wine- 
glass of brandy ; stone and cut the raisins in halves, but do not chop 
them ; wash, pick and dry the currants, and mince the suet finely ; 
cut the candied peel into thin slices and grate down the bread into 
fine crumbs ; when all these dry ingredients are prepared, mix them 
well together ; then moisten the mixture with the eggs, which .should 
be well beaten, and the brandy ; stir well, that everything may be 
thoroughly blended, and press the pudding into a buttered mould, 
tie it up tightly with a floured cloth and boil for 5 or 6 hours. It 
may be boiled in a cloth without a mould, and will require the same 
time for cooking. As Christmas puddings are usually made a few 
days before they are required for the table, when the pudding is 
taken out of the pot, hang it up immediately, and put a plate or 
saucer underneath to catch the water that may drain from it. The

day to he eaten, plunge it into boiling water and keep it boiling for 
two hours ; then turn it out into a mould and serve with brandy 
sauce. On Christmas day a sprig of holly or some evergreen is us- 
ually placed in the middle of the pudding and about a wineglass of 
brandy poured around it, which, at the moment of serving, is lighted, 
and the pudding thus brought to table encircled in flame. Boil 5 or 
6 hours ; 2 hours the day it is to be served. Sufficient for a quart 
mould for 7 or 8 persons. Seasonable on various festive occasions, 
particularly on the 25th of December. N. B. Five or six of these 
puddings should be made at one time, as they will keep many weeks, 
in cases where unexpected guests arrive, they will be found accepta- 
ble, and it requires only warming through, a quickly prepared dish. 
Moulds of every shape and size are manufactured for these pud- 
dings.

or bread crumbs, 3-4 Ib. of stoned raisins, 3-4 Ib of currants, 1-4 Ib. 
of suet, 3 or 4 eggs, milk, 2 oz. of candied peel, i teaspoonful of 
alspice, a pinch of salt. Let the suet be finely chopped, the raisins 
stoned and the currants picked well, washed and dried ; mix them with 
the other dry ingredients, and stir all well together ; beat and strain 
the eggs to the pudding, stir these in and add just sufficient milk to 
make it mix properly. Tie it up in a well-floured cloth, put it into 
boiling water and boil for at least 5 hours. Serve with a sprig of 
evergreen placed in the middle of the pudding and a little pounded 
sugar sprinkled over it. Sufficient for 9 or 10 children. Seasonable 
at Christmas. Bake 5 hours. 

RUM PUDDING (German). Take 8 eggs, divide the yolks from 
the whites, beat the yolks and mix with sugar, sweet, rich cream and 
a little flour or corn starch, or rice flour, very little ; put on the fire 
and, stir till thick ; then take half a small box of gelatine, say 2$c 
box, and put it in a very small pan with a small portion of water ; 
put on the fire, but not to boil ; then add it slowly, with the rum, to 
the above mixture last ; whip the whites of the eggs to a solid froth, 
and put that on top and bake to a delicate brown. To be eaten 
cold with red wine or jelly sauce. The wine and sugar to taste. 
The above proportion can be divided and make two puddings, and 
season one with rum, brandy or wine, and the other leaving out the 
spirits, can be flavored with essence of lemon or extract of vanilla 
to taste.

246 SWEET PUDDINGS. 

GRANGER ORANGE PUDDING. After peeling and seeding 4 good- 
sized oranges, cut them up. Add i 1-2 cups of sugar; let them re- 
main ; stir 2 tablespoonfuls of corn starch into i cup of nearly boil- 
ing milk or cream ; mix with a little water and the yolks of 3 eggs.

SWEET PUDDINGS. 



NOTE The crust should be rolled out thin, the apples cut up 
rather small and set thickly over the paste, then rolled up and put 
in a cloth and sewed. 

BOILED APPLE PUDDING. Apples, butter crust, sugar to taste, i 
small teaspoonful of finely minced lemon peel, 2 tablespoonfuls of 
lemon juice; make a butter crust or a suet one, using for a moder- 
ate sized pudding from 3-4 to I pound of flour with other ingredi- 
ents in proportion. Butter a basin, line it with some of the paste, 
pare, core and cut the apples into sh'ces and fill the basin with these; 
add the sugar, the lemon peel and juice and cover with crust; pinch 
the edges together, flour the cloth, place it over the pudding, tie it 
securely and put it into plenty of fast boiling water. Let it boil 
from i 1-2 to 2 1-2 hours, according to size; then turn it out of the 
basin and send it to the table quickly. Apple puddings may also 
be boiled in a cloth without a basin, but when made in this way 
must be served without the least delay, as the crust so soon becomes 
heavy. Apple pudding is a very convenient dish to have when the 
dinner hour is rather uncertain, as it does not spoil by being boiled 
an extra hour. Care, however, must be taken to keep it well cov- 
ered with water all the time and not allow it to stop boiling. Boil 
from i 1-2 to 2 1-2 hours, according to the size of the pudding and 
quality of the apples. Sufficient with i pound of flour for 7 or 8 
persons.

1-4 pound of raisins, i ounce of citron, 2 ounces of almonds, i gill 
of curacoa, i gill of marasquino, i pint of cream. Peel, core 
and cut the apples into quarters and simmer them over the fire till 
soft, then mix with them the apricot jam and the sugar, on which 
the rind of the orange should be previously rubbed; work all these 
ingredients through a sieve and put them into a freezing pot. 
Stone the raisins and simmer them in a little syrup for a few min- 
utes; add these with the sliced citron, the almonds cut in slices and 
the cherries drained from their syrup to the ingredients in the freez- 
ing pot; put in the curacoa and marasquino and freeze again; add 
as much whipped cream as will be required; freeze again and fill 
the mould; put the lid on and plunge the mould into the ice pot 
containing pounded ice and saltpetre, cover it with a wet cloth, 
where it should remain until wanted for the table. Turn the pud- 
ding out of the mould on a clean and neatly folded napkin, and serve 
as sauce a little iced whipped cream in a sauce tureen or glass dish; 
1-2 hour to freeze the mixture.

sugar, f-2 stick of vanilla, then sift the whole through a fine wire

ing-pot and freeze in an ice-pail surrounded with ice and salt, the

Marasquino from the previous day, with 4 oz. candied citron chop- 
ped coarsely or in pellets, put them into the freezing-pot with a pint 
of whipped cream and half the meringue preparation for meringue

is the great secret of having peas floury, whether in pudding or soup.

tablished, and very common practice. Any person who will impar- 
tially try both ways will be convinced of the truth of these observa- 
tions.

gar, 3 eggs beaten separately, 3 tablespoonfuls cold water, i tea- 
spoonful yeast powder ; add the beaten whites last. Grease a clean 
paper and put into a pan 14 inches by 12, or 2 smaller pans, pour in 
the batter and bake 20 minutes; then, "while warm, spread on the 
jelly, roll up and sift sugar over it. Or, when you bake your bis- 
cuits for breakfast, the stove will be hot enough to bake it. The 
sponge should be one inch thick ; or the sponge may be baked in 
gem pans as sponge cake.

2^8 SWEET CAKES. 

cup butter, 2 cups white sugar, 21-2 heaping cups of flour, i tea- 
spoonful soda and 2 of cream of tartar, or 3 spoonfuls baking pow- 
der. This, if baked in common jelly cake tins, will make 6 layers. 
Flour between the layers. For icing this cake, take the whites of 4 
eggs, beat to a stiff froth ; for every egg use 7 even tablespoonfuls of 
pulverized or crushed sugar, stirring just enough to mix ; spread it 
on the layers and sprinkle prepared or grated cocoanut over it. Ice 
the tops and sides. 

ALMOND CAKE. Take 10 oz. bitter almonds and 6 oz. sweet al- 
monds, scald in boiling water for 3 minutes, cool, peel and wash 
them, drain and wipe them dry in a cloth. Put them in a mortar 
and pound them to a paste with an egg added in small quantities to 
prevent the almonds from turning oily ; when well pounded, add 6 
oz. pounded sugar, 6 oz. butler, i small pinch of salt, i tablespoon- 
ful orange flower water. Pound all well together, adding 3 eggs 
broken, one after the other ; when well mixed, put the pounded al- 
monds in a basin. Put i Ib. of sifted flour on the paste-board, make 
a puff paste, as for puff-paste cake and give the paste five turns; 
cut it into two pieces, make a ball of each piece, roll each flat with 
arollingpin to the thickness of 1-2 an inch, and put one on a baking 
sheet. Spread the almond paste on it, leaving a margin of one inch 
and a half all round ; wet the edge of the paste and lay the other 
over it and press with the thumb ail around, to stick the two together ; 
trim off the superfluous paste ; egg the top and cut the pattern with 
a knife as for short paste cake. Bake for 50 minutes, let the cake

froth, add the orange flower water, the sugar, grated lemon rind, and 
mix these ingredients well together. Then beat the yolks of the 
eggs and add them with the lemon juice to the whites, &c. ; dredge 
in the flour gradually, keep beating the mixture well, put it into a 
buttered mould and bake the cake about an hour, or rather longer. 
The addition of a little after beaten to a cream would improve the 
cake, which is never out of season. 

PLUM CAKE. Take i gallon flour, 1-2 pint of rose water, i pint 
of cream, i pint of ale yeast; boil it, then 6 yolks of eggs, i 1-2 
pound of butter, i pound of sugar, 4 pounds of currants, i nutmeg

and cut the apples into small pieces, put sufficient moisture to 
sweeten them into a basin, add the lemon peel, which should be 
finely minced, and the cream ; stir these ingredients well, whisk 
the eggs and melt the butter, mix together, add the sliced apples, 
and let them be stirred into the mixture. Scald, peel and wash 
the almonds, cut them into long shreds and throw over the top of

the top and serve. 

HONEY CAKE. One-half cupful of sugar, 2 cupfuls of flour, i 
cupful of sour cream (rich), 1-2 teaspoonful carbonate of soda and 
honey to taste; mix the cream and honey together, dredge in the 
flour, with as much honey as will flavor the mixture nicely, stir it 
in well that all the ingredients be thoroughly mixed, add the soda 
and beat the cake well for another 5 minutes, put it into a buttered 
tin, bake it from 1-2 to 3-4 hour and let it be eaten warm. 

PLUM POUND CAKE. Take of dried and sifted flour, sifted loaf 
sugar, fresh butter, cleaned and dried currants, i Ib. each, 12 eggs; 
then whisk the yolks and whites of the eggs separately, while another 
with the hand beats the butter to a cream, and as the froth rises 
upon the eggs add it to the butter, and continue so doing until it is 
all beaten in ; mix the flour and sugar together and add them by 
degrees ; the last thing mix in the currants, together with a wine- 
glassful of rose water and a powdered nutmeg. It will require to be 
beaten during a whole hour ; bake it in a buttered tin. 

A PLAIN POUND CAKE. Work i Ib. of fresh butter to a cold 
cream and put it to 8 eggs well beaten together ; beat all together 
till well mixed and light, and put to them a little sliced lemon peel, 
a few blanched almonds chopped, sugar and 1-4 Ib. dried and sifted 
flour, bake in a pan for an hour in a quick oven or stove ; 2 small 
cakes may be made of the same ingredients. The addition of 1-2 
Ib. of currants, a few raisins and 1-2 Ib. of candied lemon and or- 
ange peel with nutmeg and cinnamon to taste will make this a 
good plum cake of moderate richness, or it may be converted 
into a fine seed cake by adding caraway and coriander seeds to 
the plum cake. 

CUP CAKE. Five eggs, 2 large teacupfuls molasses, 2 each of 
brown sugar and butter, i cup rich milk, 5 cups sifted flour, 1-2 tea- 
cupful cloves and allspice, 1-2 teacupful of ground ginger, and i 
teaspoonful soda ; cut up the butter in the milk and warm them 
slightly ; warm also the molasses and stir it into the milk and butter, 
then in the sugar, and set it away to cool ; beat the eggs very light 
and then beat them into the mixture, adding the flour, spices, 



28O ICING AND FROSTING. 

&c., and stir the whole very hard ; butter small tins and nearly 
fill them with the mixture and bake in a moderate oven. 

QUEEN CAKE. One-half Ib. of flour, 1-2 Ib. of pounded loaf 
sugar, 3 eggs, i teacupful of cream, 1-2 Ib. of currants, i tea- 
spoonful of carbonate of soda, essence of lemon or almond to taste. 
Work the butter to a cream, dredge in the flour, add sugar and cur- 
rants, mix the ingredients well together ; beat the eggs, mix them 
with the cream and flavoring and ftir them to the flour, add the car- 
bonate of soda, beat the paste well for 10 minutes, put it into small 
buttered pans and bake the cake from 1510 30 minutes. Grated 
lemon rind may be substituted for the lemon and almond flavoring, 
which will make the cakes equally nice. 

SMALL SPONGE CAKES. The weight of 8 eggs in pounded sugar, 
of 5 eggs in flour, flavoring to taste ; let the sugar be well pounded 
and sifted and the flour perfectly dry ; separate the whites from the 
yolks of the eggs, beat the butter with the sugar, then beat the 
whites until they become rather stiff, and mix them with the yolks, 
but do not stir them more than is just necessary to mingle the in- 
gredients well together. Dredge the flour in by degrees, add the fla- 
voring, butter the tins well, pour in the butter, sift a little sugar over 
the cakes and bake them in rather a quick oven, but do not allow 
them to become too brown, as they should be rather pale. Remove 
them from the tins before they get cold, then store them away in a 
closed tin canister or wide-mouthed glass bottle ; bake from 10 to 15 
.minutes in a quick oven. 

ICING AND FROSTING. 

BOILED ICING FOR CAKES. Take the best refined loaf sugar 
break it into small lumps, and pour over it some cold water, taking 
care to use no more than will be sufficient to dissolve it. Mash the 
lumps with a wooden spoon, and put over the fire to boil without 
skimming, until the syrup is of the consistence of honey. In the 
meantime beat to a stiff froth the whites of 3 eggs, allowing this num- 
ber of eggs to every pound of sugar. Strain the boiled syrup in 
water, immediately upon removing it from the fire, and in a few min- 
utes stir in gradually the beaten whites of eggs and some lemon juice 
or essence ; beat it until very smooth and light, and put in a few drops 
of indigo, squeezed through a muslin bag to make it a pearly white. 
If the icing is too thin, set the bowl in an oven of boiling water over 
a few bright coals or stove, and stir it while it boils, not letting it 
stick to the sides of the bowl ; or you may omit a portion of the 
whites of eggs. If too thick from standing, add some beaten white 
of the eggs, a small portion at a time, until of the proper consistency. 
Put on the icing while it is warm. 



ICING AND FROSTING. 28 1 

FROSTED RICE. Boil a cupful office in milk till tender, salt and 
flavor to taste. Beat the yolks of 3 eggs to this, in a deep dish ; 
then beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, with a little sugar 
and lemon, and spread over the rice, and brown in the oven. Serve 
cold. 

DESIGNS FOR FROSTED EGO AND WHITE SUGAR. Make a coronet 
or funnel of white paper, with a pipe or tube at the end of it, either 
of glass, tin, a quill or a piece of reed, pasted in the small end, then 
fill the funnel with a mixture of white of egg and sugar, beaten well 
to a paste, then tie up the top of the funnel, or close it with your 
hand, then mark or not your design of leaves, flowers, etc., and 
squeeze the egg over them, and by this way you can make any mark, 
either with frosted egg, jelly, or anything. You can go over it several 
times, to make the design richer. By coloring the white frosting with 
a little of the juice of spinach, you can have green leaves; with a lit- 
tle saffron or carmine, you can have flowers and roses, both yellow 
and red, of any color or tint. 

ICED A"PPLE. This may be served as an entrement, with boiled 
barley, or as a dessert dish. Peel and core without dividing, a dozen 
apples, steam very gently in a lined sauce-pan, or pipkin, with 1-2 
pound of sugar, and 1-2 a pint of water ; when tender, lift very care- 
fully on the dish, have ready 2 dozen apples, pared, cored and cut in 
thin slices ; then put them into the same syrup from which the other 
apples have been taken, and add the rind of half a lemon, chipped 
very fine, and the juice of a whole lemon ; boil gently, till reduced to 
a stiff marmalade, stirring to prevent from burning. . Cover the bot- 
tom of a pretty dessert dish with some of the marmalade, and place 
over that a layer of stewed apples, in the inside or which, and be- 
tween each, place a layer of marmalade; then place another layer cf 
apples, and fill up the cavities as before, forming the whole into a 
raised oval shape ; then whisk to a froth the whites of 3 eggs and 4 
tablespoonfuls of pulverized white sugar, and cover the apples with 
the icing. Blanch and cut into narrow strips, two or three dozen 
sweet almonds and stick' them up in the icing; strew over a little 
granulated sugar and serve cold. It may be served as a most ex- 
cellent supper dish. 

ROYAL ICING FOR CAKES. (Mrs. S.) Pound well in a mortar, the 
best white sugar, and sift through a silk sieve, put it into a bowl with 
the whites of 3 or 4 eggs, whisked to a solid froth, to which the juice 
of 1-2 a lemon has been added, keep whisking, till the mixture be- 
comes so areated (light) that it hangs in flakes from a spoon. It is 
then ready for use. NOTE. If the mixture is too stiff to spread, add 
a litte more white of egg, if too soft, add more sugar. 

To ICE A VERY LARGE CAKE. Take and beat the whites of 20 



CUSTARDS. 

eggs, then gradually beat i pound of double refined sugar, sifted 
through a lawn sieve; mix them well in a deep wooden pan, add some 
flower water, and a piece of fiesh lemon peel ; of the former enough 
to flavor and no more. Whisk it for 3 hours, till the mixture is thick 
and white, then, with a thin, broad bit of board, spread it all over the 
top and sides, and set it in a cool oven, and an hour will harden it. 

HOT ICING. Add 2 or 3 tablespoonfuls of water, just enough to 
dissolve i pound of powdered sugar, then boil. Beat the whites of 
4 or 5 eggs to a solid froth, add the hot sugar, stirring quickly, till 
smooth ; beat 2 minutes, flavor to taste, spread over the cakes and 
set in a warm place. 

ICING FOR CAKE. Beat and sift 8 oz of fine white sugar, put it in- 
to a mortar with 4 spoonfuls of rose water, with the whites of 2 eggs 
beaten and strained; whisk it well, and when the cake is almost cold, 
dip a feather in the icing and cover the cake well ; set it in the oven 
to harden, but don't let it stay to discolor. Put the cake in a dry 
place. This is for a very large cake. 

CUSTARDS. 

SNOW BALL, OR BOILED CUSTARD, (K. D.) Allow 8 eggs for a 
rich custard and 4 for a plainer, one to every quart of milk ; beat the 
whites and yolks separately, the whites to a solid froth, then dip

slice lay the cooked froth over a sieve to drain, then strain the milk, 
sweeten well with powdered sugar and flavor to taste ; then beat the 
yolks of the eggs till smooth and as soon as cool enough stir 
constantly to the milk, that it may not curdle, when boiling hot, but 
not to boil, or it will become lumpy; remove from the fire and stir 
till a little cool, then turn it into a bowl or deep dish, then put in the 
lumps of the cooled whites, and put into each lump a piece of jelly.

milk, sweeten and strain it and add a glass of wine; set your cups in 
an oven of water; boil the water to cook the custards or bake them. 

FROZKN CUST\RD. One quart of cream, 2 quarts of milk, i 1-2 
Ibs. of sugar, yolks of 4 eggs, with milk, eggs and sugar, put on the

bake. 

BREAD AND BUTTER CUSTARD. Cut as many very thin slices of 
white bread as will cover the bottom and line the sides of a bak- 
ing dish, but first rub it thick with butter; put apples, in thin slices, 
into the dish in layers till full, strewing sugar between and bits of 
butter ; in the meantime soak as many thin slices of bread as will 
cover the whole in warm milk, over which lay a plate and a weight 
to keep the bread close on the apples; bake slowly 3 hours; to a 
middling-sized dish use 1-2 Ib. of butter in the whole.

carefully ail froth from the surface, put them in a flat stew pan with 
boiling water to the height of the cups; put the stew pan, with live 
coals on its cover, and on a very slow fire for 15 minutes ; the water 
should only bubble for a few minutes; set the custards to cool in 
water, wipe the cups clean and serve.

they cool; rub the almonds through a sieve to this and set it over 
the fire to thicken, carefully stirring it, pour it into a pitcher and stir 
until it cools ; instead of boiling this may be baked in cups, or in a 
dish with an elegantly cut paste border : flour of rice may be used 
instead of almonds ; they are then called rice custards. 

CORN STARCH CUSTARDS. Three tablespoonfuls of corn starch 
to 2 pints of milk ; stir the corn with a small quantity of the milk 
and flavor it to taste ; beat up 3 eggs, heat the remainder of the 
milk near boiling, then add the mixed starch, the eggs, 5 table- 
spoonfuls of sugar, or a little butter and salt ; boil it 2 minutes, stir- 
ring it briskly.

JELLIES AND PRESERVES. 

COCOANUT JELLY. Put a pound of picked red currants into a 
china dish, pour over 4 ounces of clarified sugar, cover it and let it 
stand for a night in a cool place, the next day pour the currants over 
a stretched napkin or in a filtering bag and let it drain the juice off 
clear. In the meantime prepare a wine jelly in which only 2 lemons 
are to be used ; after the jelly has been clarified, strained and allowed 
to get cold mix it with the currant jelly. 

STRAWBERRY JELLY. Allow 1 2 ounces of sugar for every pound 
of fruit, wash the berries in your kettle till soft, or boil them, mix in 
the sugar thoroughly, boil 1-2 hour, then put into glasses. The jufce 
before preserving should be strained. 

ORANGK JELLY. Boil 2 ounces of isinglass in i pint of water, 3-4 
pound of loaf sugar in another pint of water, squeeze 8 oranges, 
add the juice and rind of i lemon and grate the peel of some of 
the oranges, mix all the ingredients together and let it boil for 20 
minutes or less ; strain through a flannel bag and put into glasses 
or a mould. Or two quarts of calve's feet or cow heel stock made 
stiff, add the juice of 12 large California oranges and the peel of 
6, the juice of 2 lemons and the peel of i ; pare the oranges and 
lemons very thin, boil together for 1-2 hour and sweeten to taste. 
Strain through a piece of muslin into glasses. 

LEMON JELLY. Dissolve i ounce of isinglass in a pint of water, 
then add i pound of lump sugar, the juice and rind of 2 lemons, let 
it boil 10 minutes after the ingredients are in ; strain into glasses or 
a mould. 

FRUIT JELLY WITH CHAMPAGNE. Put 2 ounces of gelatine in a 
stew pan with 3-4 pound of lump sugar, beat 3 whites of eggs, 
moisten them with i quart of water and the juice of a lemon, pour 
the whole into the stew pan containing the gelatine and put it on the 
fire, stirring with a wire whisk until it boils ; take the jelly off the fire, 
let it cool for a few minutes and strain it through a jelly bag, pour it 
back and strain again until it is perfectly clear ; when quite cold add 
i pint of champagne to the jelly; cut some pears and apples to an 
olive shape and boiled in a syrup with dried cherries, preserved apri- 
cots and green gages, put a plain cylinder mould in the ice, pour in 
1-8 inch thickness of jelly, pour in sufficient jelly to cover it, and con- 
tinue the layers of fruit and jelly until the mould is nearly full then let 
it set a little and finish with jelly only ; cover the mould with a baking 
sheet with ice on the top, let it remain on the ice 2 hours, turn the 
jelly out of the mould and serve. This jelly may be garnished with 
fresh strawberries, grapes, apricots, peaches, currants, &c. 



286 JELLIES AND PRESERVES. 

WINE JELLY (made with gelatine.) Put 3-4 ounce of gelatine into 
a pint of water the night before making the jelly with a bit of lemon 
peel and 3-4 pound of sugar; squeeze into a pint measure the juice 
of 4 lemons with i 1-2 glass of brandy, some orange flavoring or 
spirit of punch and fill up with raisin wine, whites and yolks of 2 
eggs beaten, boil gently till the scum separates and press through a 
jelly bag, put into glasses or a mould, let it remain on the ice for 2 
hours, turn the jelly out of the mould and serve. This jelly may be 
garnished with strawberries, apricots, grapes, peaches, cherries, cur- 
rants, &c. 

CKANBKKKY JELLY. In an enamelled kettle put the berries, set 
over the fire with just enough water to cover them, after they begin 
to boil break them with a spoon ; iia a few moments take them from 
the fire and strain through a coarse sieve ; allow a cup of sugar to 
each cup of the berry juice (strained) ; boil together till it jellys ; it 
will not take as long as other fruit. 

POMEGRANATE JELLY. Extract the bright pips from 16 ripe pome- 
granates, bruise these in a basin with i pound of roughly pounded 
sugar, add these to a gill of spring water, and then filter the prepar- 
ation through a jelly bag without the aid of paper pulp, in order to 
preserve the delicate flavor of the fruit. The strained juice of the 
pomegranates must be mixed with 2 ounces of clarified isinglass, 6 
drops of cochineal, and, if necessary, to mold out the quantity of 
jelly required to fill the mould some thin clarified syrup may be 
added ; set a jelly mould in a basin of rough ice and fill the mould 
with alternate layers of jelly and the bright pips of this fruit. 

NOTE A glass of nozean maybe added if required. 

BARBERRY JELLY WITH APPLES. Clarify 2 ounces of gelatine with 
3 whites of eggs, i 1-2 pint of water, and the juice of a lemon, 
boil i quart of syrup in a copper boiler or preserving kettle and 
throw into it 1-4 pound of picked berries, put the whole into a 
basin, cover it, and let it stand for 2 hours, then strain the bar- 
berries through a cloth and mix the syrup with the gelatine. Should 
the jelly be of too pale a color, add a few drops of prepared cochi- 
neal. Cut 5 large, plump, ripe apples in 8 pieces, cook them in 
some syrup, and drain them on a sieve ; put a cylander mold in ice, 
pour in some jelly to the depth of 1-4 inch ; when it is set arrange 
on it a layer of the pieces of apples, cover them with jelly, let it set, 
continue in the same way till the mould is nearly full with layers of 
fruit and jelly, then let it settle a little and finish with jelly only, cover 
the mould with a baking sheet with ice on the top. 

APPLE JELLY. Pare and core some ripe, plump, well-shaped ap- 
ples, such as pippins or other nice apples, and throw them into cold 
water as you do them ; put them into a preserving pan, and with as 



JELLIES AND PRESERVES. 287 

little water as will cover them ; let them coddle, and when the lower 
sides are done turn them. Observe that they do not lie too close when 
put in. If you wish the jelly to be red mix some pounded cochi- 
neal with the water and boil with the fruit ; when sufficiently done, 
take them out of the dish that they are to be served in, the stalk 
downwards. Take the water and make a rich jelly of it with loaf 
sugar, boiling the thin rind and juice of a lemon. When come to 
a jelly let it grow cold and put it on and among the apples ; cut the 
peel of a lemon in narrow strips and across the eye of the apple. 
Take care that the color be fine at first, or the fruit will not after- 
wards gain it. Use as little cochineal as will serve best, or the syrup 
will have a bitter taste. 

JELLY OF GOOSEHKKRIKS. Let them be of the right crystal sort, 
dead ripe; plump through a hair sieve, keeping back all the seeds 
and hulls; then put the pulp into a preserving pan or skillet with al- 
most its weight in the best white sugar; boil it together over a clear 
fire, keeping it stirred till it is quite thick and will jelly, then put it 
into glasses without further straining. 

JELLIED GRAPES (Mrs. Lewis.) One-third cup of rice, 2 cups 
uf grapes, 1-2 cup of water, and 2 spoonfuls of wh'te sugar dust; 
sprinkle the rice and sugar among the grapes while placing them in 
a dish ; pour on the water, cover close and simmer 2 hours slowly in 
the oven. Serve cream for sauce or as cold pudding. If served 
as warm as pudding increase slightly the proportion of sugar and 
rice. 

CURRANT JELLY EITHER RED OR BLACK. Take i Ib. of double 
refined sugar put into a skillet or an enameled stew pan with just 
enough water to moisten it, boil it up and clarify with the white of 
an egg, skim it clean, then put in the juice of i quart of currants and 
boil it till you think it will jelly, then strain through a muslin bag into 
glasses ; pour a little brandy on the top of each and tie over them 
a double paper. Some put a little brandy on the top of them and 
sprinkle sugar over that and tie down ; some dip a piece of tissue 
paper in brandy, and over that a piece of light brown paper dip- 
ped in gum arabic water, then tie down. 

WINK JELLY. Dissolve 2 medium sized boxes of Cox's galatine 
in i quart of boiling water; add another pint and a half of cold wa- 
ter, 2 pounds of white crushed sugar, i pint of sherry wine and tne 
juice and grated rind of 3 lemons. 

NOTE How valuable this recipe for the sick patient when it can 
be prepared in so short a time, instead of the long waiting, as in 
other modes, which to the poor sufferer seems lengthened for an 
eternity. 

STRAWBERRIES PRESERVED IN HONEY. Drop large, not quite ripe 



288 JELLIES AND PRESERVES. 

strawberries into clear, purified honey in a preserving kettle just 
coming to a boil, remove the froth as it rises and let them simmer 
until the syrup begins to thicken, then put some in a cold saucer and 
let them remain awhile; if the syrup is clear, the fruit transparent 
and tenacious it is done. Take it up and pour the syrup in a deep 
dish ; when cold put the fruit carefully in a jar and pour the syrup 
over it. Cut a paper to fit the top of the jar, dip it in brandy and 
lay it smoothly over the preserves, then tie a paper over the mouth 
and set it away in a cool, dry place. The honey forms a syrup more 
readily than sugar, and hardens the fruit quickly. On a warm, dry 
day the preserves can be set in the sun. 

To PRESERVE PEARS. Pare very thin and simmer in a thin syrup, 
and let them lie a day or two. Make the syrup richer and simmer 
again, and repeat this until they are clear, then drain and dry them 
in the sun or cool oven a very little time. They must be kept in 
syrup and dried as wanted, which makes them more moist and 
rich. 

CRAB APPLE PRESERVES. To i pound of crab apples take a 
pound of white sugar, the juice of a lemon and a little syrup from 
common apples ; dissolve the sugar in it, let it boil and skim clear ; 
then prick the crabs with a coarse needle, or a fine wooden splinter 
is better, and put them into the syrup. Let them boil gently till a 
straw will pierce them, put them into pots and cover them well with 
syrup. 

A NEW AND EXCELLENT WAY TO PRESERVE PEACHES. (Mrs, B.) 
Pare, halve and weigh the peaches, then put them into a preserving 
kettle full of boiling water, and to every 6 pounds of fruit put a tea- 
spoonful of soda ; let them boil i minute, take them off and throw 
them into cold water and remove any dark scum that may adhere to 
them; make the syrup of 1-2 pound sugar and a gill of water to 
every pound of fruit. Boil and clarify it, and when well skimmed 
put in the fruit, and when 1-2 done take the peaches from the syrup 
and lay on dishes so that each piece shall be separate, and let them 
get entirely cold, then return to the boiling syrup and cook until 
done. Boil the syrup until rich and clear. This preserve will keep 
12 months. 

N. B. It is best to warm the jars and put the preserves in hot ; if 
the jars are of glass they will break unless heated before filling 
them. 

SPICED PEACHES. To 9 pounds of peaches add 4 1-2 pounds of 
sugar, i pint of vinegar, and cloves, cinnamon and mace tied in 
separate cloths ; pare and halve the peaches and put them in a jar, 
boil the vinegar, spice and sugar together for a few moments and 
pour over the peaches boiling hot, let them stand over night, and in 



JELLIES AND PRESERVES. 289 

the morning put all in a kettle and boil 10 minutes. Take out the 
peaches, leaving the spice, and boil the vinegar till it begins to 
thicken, then pour over the peaches. 

PINE APPLE PRESERVES WITHOUT COOKING. Remove thoroughly 
with a very sharp knife the rough rind of the pine apple and cut in 
thin slices, then for every pound of the fruit ailow i of sugar, fine 
and white ; put at the bottom of small glass jars, sugar i inch deep, 
then put in a layer of pine apple sliced nearly i inch deep, then a 
layer of sugar of the same depth, press down with a spoon as tightly 
as possible not to mash the fruit, then another layer of sugar, then 
of apple, and so on till the jar is full ; close tightly with sealing wax. 
It will taste like the fresh fruit. 

A WEST INDIA MODE OF PRESERVING PINE APPLE. Gather the 
pines with small tops, or if foreign fruit select in the same way, then 
with a short knife remove the little prickly leaves between every 
flake, but be careful not to cut too near the top ; put them into salt 
and water a little warm, to make them turn yellow, which will be in 
about 24 hours, then place them on a slow fire in water and lemon 
juice, composed of three parts of the former and one of the latter ; 
do not keep them too long on the fire, for fear of losing the top ; 
when they are done put them in cold water, then take them out and 
let them be thoroughly dried ; put a good rich syrup to them, which 
must be changed for fresh syrup three or four days afterwards, or 
sooner. 

To PRESERVE QUINCES. Pare and cut them in pieces one inch 
thick, take out the cores carefully, so as to have the slices in the 
form of a ring, allow i pound of nice white sugar to each pound of 
fruit ; dissolve in cold water, having i quart of water to i pound of 
sugar, then put it to the sliced quinces and let them soak in it 10 or 
12 hours. Put them in a preserving kettle and put it on a moder- 
ate fire, cover them over and let the quinces boil gently. There 
should be more than enough syrup to cover the quinces; when a 
straw will enter them easily take them from the fire and turn them 
over and boil down the syrup so that there will be just enough to cover 
the fruit. The fruit and syrup will be clear when done. The par- 
ings and cores of the quinces with a few whole ones will make a nice ' 
marmalade. 

BRANDY PEACHES. Peel fine large peaches that are nearly ripe, 
weigh them and allow 1-4 pound of the best white sugar to every 
pound of fruit- Put the sugar in a preserving kettle and cover it 
with water; boil it 15 minutes, and after it gets hot through care- 
fully remove the scum, then drop i dozen peaches in at a time until 
you get all cooked enough to put a straw in ; take them out care- 
fully with a skimmer and put them to cool in flat dishes ; when per- 



290 

X 

fectly cold put them in a jar, let the syrup cook thick, and when 
that is cold mix 1-2 syrup and 1-2 French brandy or apple brandy, 
cover the peaches well with it ; keep them well covered. 

BRANDY GRAPES. For this purpose the grapes should be in large 
bunches and quite ripe. Remove every grape that is the least shriv- 
eled or in any way defective. With a needle prick each grape in 
three places. Have, ready a sufficiency of the best loaf sugar pow- 
dered and sifted, put some sugar into the bottom of the jars, then 
put in a bunch of grapes, and cover all thickly with sugar, then an- 
other bunch, then more sugar, and so on till the jar is nearly full ; 
finishing with a layer of sugar, then fill up to the top with the best 
white brandy ; cover the jars as closely as possible and set them 
away. They must not go over the fire. The grapes should be of 
the best quality. 

APPLE SWEET MEATS. To 12 pounds of sweet apples add 4 
pounds of sugar, i pint of vinegar. Put the vinegar and sugar 
together to dissolve, then put in the apples with lemon, ginger root 
and cloves. 

ISINGLASS OR GELATINE JELLY. (Substitutes for calPs feet.) 
Three ounces of isinglass or gelatine, 2 quarts of water ; put the 
isinglass or gelatine into a sauce pan with the above proportion 
of cold water, bring it quickly to a boil, and let it boil very fast 
until the liquor is reduced 1-2, carefully remove the scum as it 
rises, then strain it through -a jelly bag, and it will be ready for 
use. If not required very clear, it may be merely strained through 
a fine sieve instead of being run through a bag. Rather more 
than 1-2 ounce of isinglass is about the proper quantity to use 
for a quart of strong calf's feet stock, and rather more than 2 
ounces for the same quantity of fruit juice. As isinglass varies 
so much in quality and strength it is difficult to give the exact 
proportions ; the larger the mould the stiffer should be the jelly, and 
where there is no ice more isinglass must be used than if the mix- 
ture w'ere frozen. This forms a stock for all kinds of jellies, which 
may be flavored in many ways. Sufficient, with wine, sfyrup, fruit, 
&c., to fill 2 moderate sized moulds. Seasonable at any time. 

N. B. The above, when boiled, should be perfectly clear, and may 
be mixed with warm wine flavorings, fruits, &c , and then run through 
the bag. 

SWEETMEAT OF CURRANT JELLY. Pick the stalks from your fruit, 
wash and set them on a sieve to drain, then have 4pounds of red 
currants, 8 pounds each of white currants and raspberries and 3 
pints of water ; put all into your preserving kettle and set it on the 
stove or fire, continually stiring it to prevent its burning and sticking 
to the bottom, and let boil about 10 minutes, then place a sieve over 



JBLLIES AND PRESERVES. 

a basin of suitable size to catch the juice from the draining cur- 
rants, which have been put into the sieve; let them remain till all 
the moisture has passed out, then pass the juice while hot through 
a tammy or muslin bag, then for every pint of juice allow i Ib. 
of loaf sugar and boil it slowly until it thickens, stirring with a 
clean skimmer to prevent its boiling over, and keeping it skimmed 
to remove all the impurities that may rise to the top, now and 
then lifting the skimmer out of the syrup, and when the boiling 
juice drops from it in thin sheets it is done. Take it off the fire 
and fill your small jars or pots. 

N. B. Currant jelly is made precisely as the above, only the 
raspberries are left out and 3-4 pound of sugar is allowed to each 
pint of juice. Currant jelly is used for the garnishing of pastry 
and the sweetmeat of currant jelly for sauces to serve with game 
of any kind or other fresh meats. 

RASPBERRY JAM; To every pound of raspberries allow i pound 
of sugar, 1-4 pint of red-currant juice. Gather the fruit of this pre- 
serve in fine weather, and use after picking as soon as possible. 
Take off the stalks, put the raspberries into a preserve-pan, then 
mash them with a wooden spoon or pestle, and let them boil 15 min- 
ute, skimming them well, then add the currant juice and sugar, and 
boil 1-2 hour. Skim the jam well after the sugar is added, or the 
preserves will be turbid. The addition of the currant juice is a very 
great improvement to this preserve, as it gives a piquant taste, which 
the flavor of the raspberries seem to require. It is best to put this 
jam in pint cups, jars, or cans. 

QUINCK MARMALADE. Pare and quarter quinces and take their 
weight in sugar, to every 4 pounds of sugar, add one quart of water; 
boil and skim, and have ready, against 4 pounds of quince' are toler- 
ably tender, by the following mode : lay (hem in a stone jar, with a 
teacup of water at the bottom ; and pack them with a little sugar 
strewed between ; cover the jar closely, and set in a stove or cool 
oven, and let them soften till the color becomes red, then pour the 
first syrup and a quart of juice into the preserving pan, and boil all 
together, till the marmalade be completed, breaking the lumps with 
the preserving ladle. By following the above recipe, the fruit which 
is so hard, will make a good marmalade in a short time. Stewing 
them in a jar and then squeezing the quince pulp through a thin cloth 
is the best method of obtaining the juice, to add as above, but first 
dip the cloth* in boiling water, wring, and then shake it out and pour 
in the juice. 

APPLE MARMALADE. Take apples that are ripe, large and round, 
or 12 pippins, or russets, peel, core and cut in quarters, put them in 
a stew pan, with 2 or 3 spoonfuls of water, and 2 cups of sugar, put 



292 JELLIES AND PRESERVES. 

them over a slow fire till melted, then reduce, by stirring over a fierce 
fire, cool and dish up the apples into a compote dish, sprinkle some 
fine sugar over the top and glaze it with the red hot salamander. 

ORANGE MARMALADE. (K.. A.) Carefully remove the rind from 
bitter or sweet oranges, without any of the white, boil till soft, chang- 
ing the water twice ; then soak them in cold water for a few minutes, 
drain and pound them to a fine paste ; to each pound of peel 
allow 1-2 a pound of white granulated sugar, make a strong syrup of 
it, put into the paste and boil the two together, stirring constantly, till 
the marmalade is done. When done, it will draw out like a thread 
between the thumb and finger. The rind of shaddock or pomeloe 
can be used in the same way. 

LEMON CHEESE CAKE. 1-4 pound of butter, i pound of loaf sugar, 
the rind of 2 lemons, and the juice of 3 ; put all the ingredients into 
a stew pan, carefully grating the lemon rind and straining the juice ; 
keep stirring the mixture over the fire, till the sugar is dissolved, and 
it begins to thicken. When of the consistency of honey, it is done ; 
then put it into small jars and keep in a dry place. This mixture 
will remain good for 3 or 4 months. When made into cheesecakes, 
add a few pounded almonds, or candied peel, or grated sweet bis- 
cuit, line some patty pans with good stiff paste, rather more than 
half fill them with the mixture; bake for 1-4 hour in a good brisk 
oven. Sufficient for 24 cheese cakes. Seasonable at any time. 

LEMON BUTTER. i pound of white sugar, 1-4 pound of fresh but- 
ter, 6 eggs, juice and grated rind of 3 lemons, taking out all the seeds. 
Boil all together a few minutes, till thick as honey, stirring constant- 
ly ; put in small jars or tumblers, covered with paper, dipped in 
white of egg. One teaspoonful is enough for about a cheese cake. 
This will keep for a long time in a cool, dry place. 

APRICOTS PRESERVED WHOLE. Take the largest and cleanest ap- 
ricots to be had, pick out the stones by slitting them down the sides 
with a silver knife or skewer; take nearly their weight in good lump 
sugar, dip each lump in water, and put over the fire, which just boil, 
skim, and put by till cold, then pour it over the fruit in the preserv- 
ing pan, warm very quickly, and only allow them to simmer, put them 
by till next day, and warm them again, continuing this till they look 
clear ; then take the fruit from the syrup. The latter must now be 
well boiled and skimmed, and when cold, poured over the fruit. 

GREEn GAGES PRESERVED WHOLE. Prick them all over with a pin 
or splinter, then put them in scalding water; let them simmer, skim 
and take their weight in sugar ; put the sugar into the preserving pan, 
with 1-2 its bulk in water, let it boil well and skim very' clean ; put in 
the plums, let them boil up once, take them off and set them by till 
next day ; then take them out one by one from the syrup, boil it and 



JELLIES AND PRESERVES. 293 

skim very clear; put in the plums and let them boil very gently for 
20 minutes, take them off as before, let them stand till cold, then put 
them into jars, laying them very close. 

PRESERVE DAMSONS. To every pound of damsons allow 3-4 of a 
pound of powdered sugar, put into jars, or well glazed earthen pots, 
alternately a layer of damsons and one of sugar ; tie a strong paper 
or cloth over the pots, and set them in the oven, after tbe bread is 
drawn, and let them stand till the oven is cold. The next day strain 
off the syrup and boil it till thick ; when cold, put the damsons into 
small jars or glasses, pour over the syrup, which should cover them, 
and cover with a cloth. 

RHUBARB PRESERVES. To every 12 pounds of fruit, peeled and 
cut as for tarts, put the same weight in lump sugar, and 1-4 pound of 
bitter almonds, blanched and pounded, the juice of a lemon and the 
peel chopped fine ; after putting the sugar to the rhubarb, let it stand 
through the night, then boil it ; when it begins to thicken add pound- 
ed (fine) coniander, and the other ingredients, together with i 1-2 
wineglass of good French brandy ; a teaspoonful of ginger is thought 
to be an improvement to the flavor. 

CHERRY PRESERVE. Take 5 pounds of large, fully ripe, and plump 
cherries, so that after picking and stoning them, there may be 4 Ibs. 
left ; put 2 Ibs. of lump sugar into the preserving pan with i pint of 
water, and boil it for 3 minutes, then add the cherries, stirring them 
lig-htly with the skimmer, so as not to break them ; boil for 8 minutes, 
then pour the whole into a large basin, and let the cherries soak for 
24 hours, then strain them, boil the syrup, adding i pound of lump 
sugar, throw in the cherries and boil for 8 minutes more ; when cold, 
put into pots, and cover in the same way as currant jelly, with around 
paper, dipped in brandy, and laid on the top of the preserve, and 
then with a round paper tied round the top of the pots with a string. 

GRAPES PRESERVED IN BUNCHES. Take full clusters of grapes, not 
fully ripe, trim the stems neatly, make a syrup of a pound of sugar, 
and a teacup of water, for each pound of grapes ; make it boiling hot 
and pour it over them, let them remain fora day or two, then drain 
off the syrup, boil it again, skim it and pour it over; after a day or 
two, put the grapes and syrup over the fire, boil very gently, until 
they are clear, and the syrup rich ; take them up carefully, lay them 
on plates to become cold, boil the syrup for nearly an hour, skim it, 
let it cool and settle, put the grapes in glass jars, and pour the syrup 
over. Serve cold. 



294 MINCED MEATS. 

MINCED MEATS. 

MINCED MEAT WITH UNCOOKED MEAT. Take 3 1-2 pounds each 
of finely chopped beef suet, the lean sirloin of beet minced raw, and 
finely chopped apples that are large and plump, 7 pounds of well 
picked, washed and dried currants, 1-2 pound each of citron, lemon 
peel and orange peel, cut small ; 2 Ib. fine moist sugar, i oz. mixed 
spices, the rind and juice of 4 lemons and 4 California oranges. Mix 
well and put in a deep pan, mix a bottle of brandy and i of white 
wine, the juice of the lemons and oranges that have been grated to- 
gether in a basin, pour 1-2 over and press down tight with the hand, 
then add the other half and cover closely. It can be made i year to 
be used the next. 

MINCED MEAT WITH RAISINS. Of the lean of a round of fresh 
beef that has been boiled thoroughly and tender recently, but cold, 
3 pounds chopped as finely as possible with a chopping knife, clear 
off skin and filaments, 2 pounds of fresh beef suet minced very 
fine and add to it, and i pound of brown sugar. Mix thoroughly. 
Pick, wash and dry well before the fire 2 pounds of currants and 
2 pounds of the best of raisins seeded and chopped fine. Some 
raisins have no seeds, and therefore are the best for cooking pur- 
poses. Three pounds of finely chopped apples, the peel and juice 
of 2 large lemons or oranges, the peel grated in a saucer and the 
juice strained through a sieve over it. Mix this with the raisins and 
currants ; i pint of sweet wine, i tablespoonful of finely powdered 
cinnamon and white ginger, the spoons heaped; a heaped tea- 
spoonful each of powdered nutmeg, cloves, mace and pimento, 
and also 1-2 pound of citron, not minced, but cut into large slips. 
Press the whole into a deep stone jar when thoroughly mixed, and 
keep it covered in a cool, dry place. One-half the quantity is enough 
unless for a very large family. Have citron, orange and lemon peel 
ready, and put some in each of the pies when made. 

LEMON MINCED MEAT. Pound 4 lemons in a mortar after boiling 
them till soft, or chopping them while warm will do. Then mix with 
them 2 pounds of white sugar, let it remain over night, then the next 
morning add 2 pounds of suet minced very fine, i pound of rai- 
sins chopped and seeded, 2 pounds of clean, washed and dried 
currants, a gill each of brandy and port wine, i spoonful of mixed 
spices. 

RICH MINCE MEATS. Take 12 pounds of fat rump beef, the 
fatter the better, 4 pounds of fat pork, boil them together in just 
enough water to cover them until very tender;" when sufficiently 
done the meat will fall away from the bone ; chop them together 
while warm ; when finely minced add 4 pounds currants washed, 



MINCED MEATS. 



295 



dried and picked, 6 pounds good layer raisins, washed, picked and 
dried, 2 pounds Sultana or seeded raisins cut into thin slices. Mix 
these ingredients before the meat has cooled thoroughly, then add 8 
pounds of granulated white sugar, 1-2 pound each ground allspice 
and pepper, 1-4 ounce cloves, 2 ounces cinnamon; 2 ounces ginger, 
2 ounces mace all pounded. Again mix the whole mass until 
thoroughly amalgamated. Then bring the liquor that your meat 
was boiled in again to a boil, strain it through a colander over 
your mixture, stir it all well, then add i gallon of the best Jamaica 
rum, t-2 gallon of Madeira or good white wine, get your mass well 
mixed, then press very tightly into a stone jar, pour a little rum 
over the top, and set away tightly covered from the air to make 
delicious pies for a whole year, at any time desired. 

How TO MAKE MINCED MEATS. Six pounds lean beef and 
2 Ibs. suet chopped fine, 6 Ibs. of raisins with seeds removed, 2 Ibs. 
citron cut in small pieces, 2 Ibs. dried currants well picked, washed 
and dried, 6 Ibs. brown sugar, i peck of firm apples finely chop- 
ped, 4 nutmegs finely chopped or grated, 2 lemons, seeds removed 
and peel grated, i tablespoonful of allspice ground, 2 tablespoonfuls 
of powdered cinnamon, 2 teaspoonful of salt and 2 gallons boiled 
apple cider. This quantity will keep for 2 months in a very cool and 
dry place. 

PLAIN MINCED MEAT made with ingredients of home manufacture 
and very nice. Three pounds of beef or chicken chopped fine, 2 
quarts of ripe canned or dried currants, 2 quarts of ripe canned or 
dried cherries, 2 quarts of apples after they are finely chopped, two 
quarts of citron or watermelon rind cut fine, i gallon rich, boiled 
apple cider or California wine strong and sweet, two quarts of 
syrup or molasses, 2 grated or finely beaten nutmegs, 2 spoonfuls 
allspice, two of cloves finely pounded. After the ingredients are 
thoroughly mixed add a little salt and as much brown or white sugar 
as is required to make the mixture sweet enough, which will depend 
entirely on the amount of sugar previously added to the canned fruit. 
If fresh apples cannot be had, take 3 pints of dried apples chopped 
fine after soaking them the previous night. 



296 PASTRY FOR PIES. 



PASTRY FOR PIES OF ANY KIND. 

PLAIN PASTRY (Mrs. E. A. Upshur.) One and a quarter Ibs. of 
lard, 1-4 Ib. butter. Divide the flour into two parts, 3-4 in one part 
and 1-4 in the other; cut up the butter in the 3-4 of the flour and 
make it very stiff with a little water, then roll in the lard in two roll- 
ings and use the other flour to sift over the lard after it is put on the 
paste in small pieces all over it. The pastry should be worked with 
a knife and never with the hand. That makes it soft and prevents 
it from flaking. 

To PRESERVE PIE PASTE FOR A TIME. Take the pie dough or 
paste trimmings that may be left, mould it into a ball, wrap it in clean 
paper or put into a flour basket. Keep in a cool place. 

A LESS EXPENSIVE DOUGH FOR PIES. Half Ib. of butter, 3-4 Ib. 
flour, 2 spoonfuls sour cream, 2 eggs, a pinch of salt. For all kinds 
of fruits. 

HOMEMADE PASTRY. One-quarter Ib. lard or butter, or butter and 
lard of equal proportions. Take a small portion of the above, mak- 
ing out the roll very thin, handling very little, dividing the lard into 
three portions. 

BEEF SUET TO SOFTEN FOR MAKING PIE PASTE. Have it well- 
soaked, perfectly clean, dry, fresh, hard and chopped fine, then 
moisten it with a little butter, lard or oil, while working or beating 
it in a mortar, till it becomes one sheet, when it is ready to work in 
your flour in the desired proportion to make a pie paste. 

SANDWICH PASTRY. Roll out pieces of paste very thin, of equal 
size, spread apricot or raspberry jam over one of them, cover with 
the other ; bake it ; cut it in squares or rounds and glaze it with 
French glazing. 

RICE PASTE FOR SWEETS. Boil 1-2 Ib. ground rice in the smallest 
quantity of water, strain from it all the moisture as well as you can, 
beat it in a mortar with 1-2 oz. of butter, i egg well beaten and it 
will make an excellent paste for tarts, etc. 

PUFFEIT (R.). One quart sifted flour, in which rub 2 teaspoon- 
fuls cream tartar, butter the size of an egg, 2 teaspoonfuls powdered 
sugar, 2 beaten eggs, mix very smoothly and add i pint of milk and 
i teaspoonful soda dissolved in a little boiling water. Bake at once. 
Serve last with butter. 

PUFF LOAVES. To i pint of milk add 4 moderate spoonfuls 
flour, 4 eggs, leaving out the whites of 2 eggs, 1-2 Ib. butter 
melted, a little sugar and salt. This quantity makes 6 puddings. 
Bake them in a quick oven. 

FRENCH PUFF PASTB OR FJCUILLETAGE (Founded on M. Ude's 



PASTRY FOR PIES. 297 

Recipe). Equal quantities of flour and butter, say i Ib. of each, i 
pinch of salt the yolks of 2 eggs, rather more than i gill of wa- 
ter. See that the flour is perfectly dry ; squeeze all the water 
from the butter, then squeeze it in a clean cloth till there is no 
moisture ; then weigh them ; put the flour on the paste-board, 
then work lightly into it 2 oz. of the butter and make a hole in 
the center, and into this well or opening put the yolks of 2 eggs, 
the salt and about 1-4 pint water (the quantity of water must be 
regulated by the cook, as it is impossible to give the exact pro- 
portion of it). Knead up the paste quickly and lightly, and when 
quite smooth roll it square to the thickness of about 1-2 inch. 
Presuming that the batter is perfectly free from moisture and as 
cool as possible, roll it into a ball and place the ball of butter 
on the paste, fold the paste over the butter all round, and se- 
cure it by wrapping it well all over. Flatten the paste by rolling 
it lightly with the rollingpin until it is quite thin, but not thin 
enough to allow the butter to break thrpugh, and keep the board 
and paste dredged lightly with flour during the process of mak- 
ing it. This rolling gives it the first turn. Now fold the paste 
in three and roll it out again, and should the weather be very 
warm place it in a cold place on the ground to cool between 
the several turns, or in some cool place where cold water can be run 
under the paste-board, and thus prevent the paste from spoiling in 
warm weather, which it will surely do unless carefully attended to. 
Roll out the paste again twice, put it by to cool, then roll it out twice 
more, which will make 6 turnings in all. Now fold the paste in two 
and it will be ready for use. If properly made and well baked this 
crust will be delicious, and should rise in the oven about 5 or 6 
inches. The paste should be made rather firm in the first instance, 
as the ball of butter is liable to break through. Great attention 
must also be paid to keeping the butter cool, as, if this is in a soft or 
liquid state, the paste will not answer at all. Should the cook be 
dextrous enough to succeed in making this, the paste will have a 
much better appearance than that made by the process of dividing 
the butter into four parts and placing it over the rolled-out paste ; 
but, until experience has been acquired, it is recommended puff paste 
made by recipe for being very good. The above paste is used for 
vol au vent, small articles, and, in fact, everything that requires 
very light crust. 

POTATO PUFF. Take cold roast meat, beef, mutton and ham to- 
gether, clear from gristle, cut small and season with pepper and salt 
and cut pickles if liked. Roll and mash some potatoes; make 
them into a paste with an egg and roll out and dredge with flour. 
Cut round with a saucer, put some of the seasoned meat upon one* 



298 PASTRY FOR PIES. 

half and fold the other over like a puff. Pinch neatly around and fry 
a nice brown. An excellent way to save fragments of cold meat. 

EXCF.LLENT SHORT CRUSTS. To every pound of well-dried flour 
allow 2 oz. of pounded and sifted white sugar ; rub into it 3 oz. of 
fresh butter so fine as not to be seen ; into some cream put the yolks 
of 2 eggs beaten and mixed into a smooth paste. Roll it thin and 
bake in a moderate oven. 

A SUPERIOR SHORT CRUST. To every pound of flour allow 1-2 
Ib. of butter, the yolks of 2 eggs, 2 oz. sifted sugar, i gill of milk ; 
rub the butter into the flour, add the sugar and mix the whole as well 
as possible to a smooth paste, with the yolks of eggs well beaten in 
the milk. The proportion of the latter ingredient must be judged of 
by the size of the eggs ; if these are large, so much will not be re- 
quired, and more if the eggs are smaller. 

DRIPPING CRUST FOR PUDDINGS, PIES, TARTS, ETC. To every 
pound of flour allow 6 oz. of clarified beef dripping, 1-2 pint of wa- 
ter. After having clarified the dripping (which should be done by 
putting the dripping into a. clean saucepan and letting it boil for a 
few moments over a slow fire, and be careful to skim it well, let 
it stand to cool a little, then strain it through a piece of muslin into 
jars for use), weigh it, and to every pound of flour allow the above pro- 
portion of time for dripping. With a knife work the flour into a smooth 
paste with the water, rolling it three times each time, placing on the 
crust 2 oz. of the dripping, broken into small pieces. If this paste 
is properly made, and if good dripping is used, and not too much 
of it. it will be found good ; and by the addition of 2 tablespoonfuls 
of fine sugar k may be converted into a common short crust for 
fruit pies. 



MEAT AND SAVORY PIES. 299 



PIES MEAT AND SAVORY. 

All pies made either with summer fruit or with winter pre- 
serves will be improved by a mixture of apples, pared and 
sliced. Apples will, in this way, eke out the remains of a pot 
of jam to advantage. They are especially good with cher- 
ries, currants, etc., and will be found an agreeable addition to 
cranberries. Equal portions also of cranberries and any. sweet 
jam will improve both. When apples are mixed with jam they 
should be sliced thin, and if syrup be wanted a few slices boiled 
with a little of the jam in sugar and water. In making pies of 
green gooseberries, apples, or rhubarb the sugar should be white, 
and boiled in very little water to make a syrup, pour no water 
into the pie, as that destroys the nice flavor of the fruit. For fresh 
fruits short crust is very suitable. Fresh fruit pies, of all descrip- 
tions, whether cherry, green gooseberry, damson, currant or rasp- 
berry may all be made in the same manner, taking care that the 
fruit is freshly gathered and cleanly picked, observing also that if the 
gooseberries be very sour, they should be put in boiling water for 
1-4 of an hour. One-quarter Ib. of sugar is usually allowed to every 
pound of fruit in making pies. When pies have been kept till they 
are cold the crust becomes heavy and indigestable. When next 
used they should be warmed before the fire or stove to lighten the 
crust. 

FRUIT PIE. One cup of sugar, i of water, i tablespoonful flour, 
i teaspoonful lemon essence (or lemon grated), i of- cream tartar, 
1-2 teaspoonful soda, 1-2 cup dried currants; mix and boil, stirring 
to prevent the flour from settling. 

GRAPE ME. 1'ulp your grapes ; put the skins in one vessel and 
the pulp into another. Simmer the pulp and strain it through a 
colander ; then add the juice to the skins and season them to taste 
with sugar. Put between crusts and bake. 

DAMSON PIE. They should be cooked with water, sugar and 
spices before they are put on the crust or between them. In putting 
them in the first crust put butter in bits on the fruit, which improves 
all fruit pies. Small grapes should be prepared in the same way for 
pies. 

CURRANT PIE WITH OR WITHOUT RASPBERRIES. These red, ripe 
fruits require but little baking. When the currant has acquired a 
pale brown, they are sure to be done. Sugar baked with the fruit 
mingles better and gives a finer flavor, but is more apt to turn acid 
in the stomach than if added afterward. On this account it is better 
to sweeten pies and puddings for children after they are baked or 
boiled. 



3OO MEAT AND SAVORY PIES. 

RAISIN PIE. Pour i quart of water over a pound of raisins, then 
dry the raisins by squeezing them in a cloth, then grate the rind of a 
lemon into a cup of sugar, a dessert- spoonful of flour and i beaten 
egg, then stir into the raisins 3 cups of boiling water, then turn the 
raisins into the mixture and stir it again. This will make 3 pies. 
Bake between two crusts as other pies. 

ELDERBERRY PIE. Take 2-3 elderberries, 1-3 of apples peeled 
and sliced, 4 spoonfuls sugar, i spoonful each of butter and flour. 
Season with powdered coriander seed to taste. Bake between crusts. 

SUMMER MINCED PIES. Three soda crackers, i cup each of mo- 
lasses, vinegar, butter, chopped and seeded raisins, boiling water 
poured on crackers, 2 cups sugar, 3 eggs and flour to taste. 

SLICED SWEET OR IRISH POTATO PIE. Line a deep plate or dish 
with a common pie crust tolerably thin, then put in a full layer of 
butter sprinkled over thinly with finely pounded coriander seeds and 
other spices, then put in slices of potatoes sprinkled a little with 
spices, then another layer of butter, till more than full ; pour over a 
small teacupfulof water or cider, or less of either and a little brandy, 
then put on a rich, thick pie crust well pasted, so as to come off in 
flakes, on the top ; the edges should l>e removed by pressing them 
against the pie or dish, then pierce the top a number of times with 
a fork. Glaze with a feather dipped in new milk, and bake in a 
moderate oven till of a light brown. 

COCOANUT PIE. One-quarter Ib sweet butter, 1-2 Ib. powdered 
white sugar ; beat the butter and the sugar well together until it forms 
a thick cream, then add 4 well whisked eggs, whites and yolks beaten 
together; 1-2 pint grated cocoanut; i quart sweet milk, beaten well 
together; have ready some nice puff paste, line your patty pans and 
fill them nearly full of the mixture. Bake in a moderate oven. 

CROQUETTE OF FRESH WALNUTS. Take about 60 English walnuts 
when they are just ripe enough to leave thi shell by carefully cutting 
it in two; then take off the white skin that covers the fruit, keep 
clean in a cloth, then drop them in cold water, drain them on a nap- 
kin, boil the desired quantity of sugar moistened with some cold 
water, and boil it until it becomes a little brittle when dropped in 
cold water, then, with the kernels of the walnuts dipped from wooden 
tongs (for the purpose) into the candy, then place the walnut kernels 
so dipped into a mould slightly oiled, when the whole has been used 
and the kernels are cool and hard, fill the mould with whipped cream 
seasoned with a little brandy and sugar, and place some strawberries 
on the top and serve. 

Note. Almonds, oranges and other fruits may be treated in the 
same manner as the walnuts, and also green almonds. 

COCOANUT PIES. One cup rasped cocoanut soaked in milk, 3 pow-?

2 tablespoonfuls baking powder, i pint of cream or milk, 2 eggs, i 
cup of sugar, 2 heaped teaspoonfuls corn starch. Crust is to be 
baked in round tins. This makes 3 layers. When cold spread 
cream between as you do in jelly cake. The cream should be cooked 
by itself. Mrs. L. M. Kellogg. 

LEMON CREAM PIES (Mrs. Lane, Panama). To 3 spoonfuls 
moistened corn starch, pour i quart warm water and add 3 cups fine 
white sugar, the juice and peel of 3 lemons, 3 beaten eggs, a little 
salt. Bake between 2 rich pie crusts. 

RICE PIE (Mrs. Ewing). 'Two pints of milk boiled, i small tea- 
cup of rice flour mixed in very little cold water ; add to the boiling

sweeten to taste, flavor with vanilla and bake in a moderate oven. 

CUSTARD PIE. Beat 7 eggs, sweeten a quart of milk that has 
been boiled and cooled. A stick of cinnamon or a bit of lemon 
peel should be boiled in it. Sprinkle in a saltspoon of salt, add 
the eggs and a grated nutmeg, stirring the whole together. Line 
two deep plates with good paste ; set them in the oven 3 min- 
utes to harden the crust, then pour in the custard and bake 20 
minutes. 

SWEET POTATO PIE (Southern.) Wash, peel and boil your pota- 
toes till soft, and strain them; to each Ib. allow 12 oz. sugar, 8 
oz. butter, 2 cups of cream or new milk, 6 eggs well beaten, 
some cinnamon and nutmeg. Beat all thoroughly till smooth, then 
stir in a wineglass of brandy. Line your plate or dish with a 
crust and bake in a moderate oven till half done, then when cold 
pour on the potatoes and bake a light brown. Serve cold. 

SWEET POTATO PIE (grated). Boil the potatoes, when perfectly 
cold grate them, then rub in a large cup of sugar, 2 large spoon- 
fuls of butter ; beat to a cream ; add two teaspoonfuls of ground 
cinnamon, 1-2 grated nutmeg, i pinch of salt, the juice and the 
yellow grated off of a lemon, the yolks of 4 eggs beaten. Add

a soft batter. Have i rich under-crust made and fill with the batter. 
Bake a rich brown. 



3O2 MEAT AND SAVORY PIES. 



A RICH VEAL PIE. Cut steaks from a neck or breast of veal, 
season them with pepper, salt, nutmeg and a very little clove in pow- 
der. Slice 2 sweet breads and season them in the same manner ; lay 
a puff paste on the ledge of the dish, then put the meat, yolks of 
hard eggs, the sweet bread and some oysters up to the top of the 
dish. Lay over the whole some very thin slices of ham or middlings, 
and fill up the dish with water ; cover, and when it is taken out of 
the oven pour in at the top through a funnel a few spoonfuls of good 
veal gravy and some cream to fill up, but first boil it up with a tea- 
spoonful of flour, add truffles, &c., if approved, in pieces, according 
to the size of the pie ; place them in first, then some artichoke bot- 
toms, cut in 4 pieces each, next some tops of asparagus, parsley, 
onions, mushrooms, yolks of hard eggs and fine meat balls. Steam 
the whole with pepper and salt ; put in plenty of water, cover the 
pie and bake it 2 hours. On taking it out pour in some rich veal 
gravy thickened with cream and flour. 

VEAL (or chicken) AND PARSLEY PIE. Cut some slices from the 
leg or neck of veal ; if the leg, from the knuckle, season with salt, 
scald some parsley that is picked from the steins and squeeze it dry, 
cut it a little and lay it at the bottom of the dish, then put the meat, 
and so on, in layers. Fill the dish with new milk, but not so high 
as to touch the crust. Cover it, and when baked pour out a lit- 
tle of the milk and put in 1-2 pint of good scalded cream. Chicken 
may be cut up, skinned and made in the same way. 

HERRING AND LEEK PIE. Clean and skin the white part of 
some large leeks, scald in milk and water and put them in layers 
into a dish, and between the layers 2 or 3 salted herring or sal- 
mon in pieces; 1-2 pound which has been soaked for 24 hours 
before ; cover the whole with a good plain crust. When the pie 
is taken out of the oven lift up the side crust with a knife and 
empty out all the liquor, then pour in 1-2 pint scalded cream. 

VEAL PATTIES. Mince some veal that is not quite done with a 
little barley, lemon peel, a scrape of nutmeg and a bit of salt; 
add a little cream and gravy ; first moisten the meat, and if there is 
any ham scrape a little and add to it. Do not warm it till the patties 
are baked. 

CRITTEN OR CRACKLING PIE. When a bacon hog is killed the in- 
ward fat is melted for lard and strained off. What remains in the 
strainer is called critten or crackling, to i pound of which add i Ib. 
of currants and 1-2 pound of plums, the latte" stoned and chopped ; 
x pound of apples chopped fine, i pound c ambs of bread, the yolks 



MEAT AND SAVORY PIES. 303 

of 2 or 3 eggs, candied lemon and orange peel, i ounce each, a lit- 
tle ginger, nutmeg and allspice. Some add to this the lean meat of 
the hog chopped fine or pounded. As it is but a homely dish a 
plain crust will suffice made of lard or drippings, with the addition 
of a little butter. However plain the ingredients a good cook will 
make it light and well flavored. The crust should be raised and is 
usually baked in a pudding dish ; if preferred may be made in small 
tins or saucers. 

SWEET BREAD PIE. Lay a puff paste 1-2 inch thick at the bottom 
of a dish and forcemeat around the sides ; then put the batter in 
a mould or on a dish, leaving a hole in the middle for sweet breads, 
or fragments of fine chopped chicken. If wanted brown, bake 
it in a mould ; when done take out the inside sufficiently to admit 
the ragout 

TOMATO MEAT PIE. Cover the bottom of a pudding dish with 
stale bread crumbs, then have some cold mutton chopped fine ; make 
a layer of this on the crumbs, then a layer of sliced ripe tomatoes, 
then over this a layer of bread crumbs, another of meat and then a 
layer of sliced tomatoes, then cover with bread crumbs and bake un- 
til the crust is a beautiful brown. The different layers should be 
seasoned as you make them with salt, pepper and bits of butter. It 
should be seasoned rather light. Serve hot. 

HAM PIE. Make a crust the same as for soda biscuit, line your 
dish, then put in a layer of potatoes sliced thin, pepper and salt and 
a little butter, then a layer of lean ham ; add considerable water and 
you will have an excellent pie. 

SEA PIE. Put 2 pounds of beefsteak into a stew pan with a little 
celery chopped up or a pinch of ground celery seed, a small onion 
cut in slices, a teaspoonful of chopped parsley, season with pepper 
salt; put in this 6 larks dressed for roasting them, make a paste of 
suet abqutone inch thick and round like the stew pan ; put a cupful 
of water in the stew pan and cover the larks with the paste, pressing 
it against the sides of the stew pan ; simmer for i hour and serve by 
putting a knife round the sides of the stew pan to detach the paste, 
and turn it over on the dish. 

MUTTON PIE. The remains of a cold leg of mutton, loin or neck, 
pepper and salt to taste, 2 blades of pounded mace, i dessert spoon- 
ful of chopped parsley, i teaspoonful of minced savory herbs when 
liked, a little minced onion or shalot, 3 or 4 potatoes, i teacupful of 
gravy. Cold mutton may be made into very good pies if well 
seasoned and mixed with a few herbs. If the leg is used, cut it in 
very thin slices ; if of the loin or neck, into thin cutlets. Place 
some at the bottom of the dish ; season with pepper and salt, mace, 
parsley and herbs ; then put a layer of potatoes sliced, then more 



304 MEAT AND SAVORY PIES. 

mutton, and so on, till the dish is full ; add the gravy, cover with a 
crust and bake for i hour. Seasonable at any time. 

LAMB PIE. Make it of the loin, neck or breast. The breast of 
house lamb is one of the most delicate things that can be eaten. 
It should be lightly seasoned with pepper and salt ; the bone taken 
out, but not the gristles. A small quantity of jelly should be put in 
hot, but the pie should not be eaten till cold. Put in two spoonfuls 
of water before baking. Grass lamb makes an excellent pie, and 
may be either boned or not, but not to bone it is perhaps the best. 
Season only with pepper and salt. Put two spoonfuls of water and 
as much gravy when it comes from the oven. N. B. Meat pies 
being fat, it is best to let out the gravy on one side and put it in 
again by a funnel, at the center, and a little more may be added. 

MEAT PIES. It is important to have a hole in the top crust. 

BONED BEEFSTEAK PIE. Cut the skins from the fat of rump steaks, 
beat them, put them over the fire with a little butter, pepper, lemon 
juice and shalots chopped fine ; when half-done, lay them in a dish 
till cold. Blanch and strain some oysters and preserve the liquor ; 
put a layer of steaks at the bottom of the pie, another of oysters 
over that, and so on, alternately. When done, put in some gravy 
with the oyster liquor and catsup. 

PODOVIES OR BEEF PATTIES. Shred underdone dressed beef with 
a little fat, season with pepper and salt and a little shalot or onion. 
Make a plain paste, roll it thin, cut it into shape like an apple puff; 
fill it with the mince, pinch the edges and fry them a nice brown. 
The paste should be made with a little butter, eggs and milk. 

TURKEY PATTIES. Mince some of the white part, and with grated 
lemon, nutmeg and salt, a very little white pepper, cream and a very 
little butter warmed. Fill the patties. 

SOUTHERN POTPIE. Boil the backbone of a hog a little ; then chop 
it up, leaving two joints in a piece ; then line a large pan or Dutch 
oven with a rich pie paste and put the bone in with pepper and salt, 
or, if the bone be salted, very little is needed. Chop some pieces 
of fat, unsalted pork, the best, and put in. Skim the rich portion or 
foam all off of the broth in which the meat has been boi'ed and 
pour that over the meat until it is two-thirds full ; then put a short 
paste cover over it. Make a hole with your finger for the soup to 
come out when it boils. Bake moderately. When a nice brown 
take it up and serve cold for dinner. It can be rewarmed if some 
portion remains uneaten. 

VEAL POTPIE (Rizpah). Slice thinly 2 Ibs. of veal and boil in 
water till tender, season and add 6 potatoes sliced ; boil until done 
and pour into a deep pan ; stir in 2 spoonful of flour and cover with 
a biscuit crust. Bake a light brown. Be sure to have plenty gravy 
in the pie. 



MEAT AND SAVORY PIES. 305 



CHICKEN PIE (Mrs. B.) Cut up your chickens and season them 
with salt, pepper and parsley. If they are old, parboil them a few 
minutes and save the water to put in the pie. Make a moderately 
rich paste and cover the sides and bottom of a depth with it. Then 
put in alternate layers of chicken, 6 hard-boiled eggs cut in slices, 
butter, pepper, celery and a little flour from a dredging-box. Fill 
the dish 2-3 full of cold water and add 1-2 cupful of cream or milk. 
Put on a top paste and the pie round the edge, and make opening 
in the middle with a knife. It will require i hour to bake. A few 
slices of lean bacon is an addition liked by many persons. If oysters 
are in season they are nice. Put in alternate layers with the chicken. 

VIRGINIA CHICKEN PUDDING (Colonial). Cut up two young 
chickens as for frying. Season well with salt, pepper, parsley, buter 
and an onion shred fine. Make a batter of a quart of new milk, 6 
eggs well beaten, 9 tablespoonfuls of flour; stir till perfectly smooth. 
It too thick, thin with milk. When tender, take up the chicken from 
the stewpan, leaving out the necks ; place the pieces in an earthen 
dish ; pour over the batter and bake till the pudding is firm. It 
should be eaten immediately, as standing injures it, by falling and 
becoming tough. A tureen of rich sauce should accompany it, 
using as much of the broth in which the chicken was stewed as may 
be needed for the foundation of the gravy. Add catsup of any 
kind. Instead of chicken or combined with chicken, oysteres, beef- 
steak, veal or any kind of game may be used. 

How TO MAKE A SOUTHKRN CHICKEN PIE. Cut up some tender, 
fat, young chickens ; stew them slowly in water till done, with butter, 
pepper, salt, and if liked, a bit of onion and some thin slices of 
sweet pork or bacon cut up in fillets. To make the crust of the pie, 
stir up flour and cold water together with a little salt. Stand in a 
cool place and on a marble board, if you have one ; roll out the 
dough " as thin as air/' then have some sweet butter and fresh mut- 
ton suet that has been strained from the sediment, both perfectly 
cold, put the finger in and fleck the dough all over with dots of 
butter and suet, roll it over evenly, and then roll the dough out thin 
again and fleck it with bits of butter and suet as before, up to fifteen 
times, if you like it, but once or twice will do. Then make tlv 
dough into oblong cakes about the size of a large saucer and ' 
the bottom of the dish and sides, which should be wide and <! ,>, 
then put in your meet carefully, pour over plenty of the rich .ivy, 
and some more pieces of butter on the top. The chicken -ravy 
should be cold, then put on your top crust, make a hole in t'ae top

large enough to put yorfr finger in. When you are going to set the 
table for dinner put your pie in a moderate oven, and hasten the fire 
a little, and your pie will be ready. Serve hot in the same dish. 
The crust will be almost as light as snow flakes. Note. Handle 
the dough as little as possible. Let the wind blow on it in a cool 
place. Some dredge a little flour over the flecks of butter and suet 
each time before turning the dough over. 

CHICKEN PIE. Cut up young chickens in proportion to the large- 
ness of the pie ; season with pepper and salt and a little mace and 
nutmeg, all in the finest powder (likewise a little cayenne, if approved). 
Put the chicken with slices of ham or fresh gammon of bacon, force 
meat balls and hard eggs by turns in layers. If it is to be baked in 
a dish, put in a little water, but none if it be a raised crust. By the 
time time it returns from the oven have ready a gravy of knuckle of 
veal or a bit of the scrag, with some shank bones of mutton seasoned 
with herbs, onions, mace and white pepper. ^If it is not to be eaten 
hot, you may add truffles, mosels, mushrooms, etc., but not, if to be 
eaten cold. If it is. made in a dish, put in as much jelly as will fill 
it; but in raised crust the gravy must be nicely strained, and then 
put in cold as jelly. To make the jelly clear, you may give it aboil 
with the whites of two eggs, after taking away the meat, and then 
run it through a fine lawn sieve. 

CHICKEN PIE (Mrs. Hobson, San Jose, Cal.). Cut up the chicken 
and parboil it ; then make a rich crust and line the sides of a bake- 
pan with it, then put in a layer of chicken, put in pieces of butter, 
some pepper, a little salt ; then make some dumplings and drop a 
layer of them over the chicken, then add another layer of chicken, 
etc., and continue till the pan is full, and let the last layer be of 
chicken. Pour in till nearly full some of the liquor in which the 
chicken was boiled, then put on a top crust, make a hole in it and 
bake in a moderate oven, and as the liquor boils down pour in some 
more of the liquor through the hole in the top by a funnel. 

CHICKEN PIE WITH RICE (Mrs. B.) Cut up the desired number 
of young chickens and drop them into a saltish water for 30 minutes. 
Have ready 2 quarts boiled rice, not steamed, into which stir 11-4 
Ibs. butter, i quart of milk, a little salt and 6 well-beaten eggs. 
Pour into your baking dish 1-2 the quantity of this mixture and 
a few slices of ham in it, then pour in the remainder of the rice and 
eggs, and rub a little flour and milk smoothly together and put on 
the top to make it brown nicely. This pie is sufficient for twenty 
persons. 

THE OLD VIRGINIA POTPIE (Colonial). This old-fashioned and 
incomparable pie is best made in a deep Dutch oven, whether large 
or small, to suit the number of guests or persons expected to par*

take of it. Line the sides of the oven with the rich pie paste, which 
should be 1-2 inch thick ; then lay the chicken, backbone or spare- 
ribs chopped in joints 2 inches long, or all may be used together, 
chicken, etc., which should have been previously parboiled in saltish 
water till 1-2 done. When this is done sprinkle over the meat some 
pepper and bits of sweet butter, then a layer of very thinly sliced 
Irish potatoes, some pork chopped very finely, an onion or two in 
slices, and some add a few fresh oysters or mushrooms, then potato 
dumplings made according to the recipe given for dumplings for 
chicken pie; but these form modern additions to the time-honored 
and matchless potpie of our revolutionary sires, and was doubtless 
often eaten in the White House in the days of our first Presidents. 
It is a homely dish, but a very appetizing one; but no housekeeper 
should be at a loss how to make it. When the meat and layers of 
the other ingredients have filled the oven rather more, than even full, 
pour in the broth in which the meat has been boiled, to form the 
gravy, about three parts full, sprinkle a little flour over it, then lay 
over the meat an upper crust 1-4 inch thick; making a hole in it at 
the top to pour in more broth when needed, through a funnel; then 
put on the oven lid moderately heated, and then put on some burn- 
ing coals and bake a nice brown. When done remove the upper 
crust carefully. Take up the meat gravy in a bowl in order not to 
break the crust at the sides; lay this crust on the bottom of a hot 
dish, then the meat, etc., on this, very nicely, then pour the gravy 
over, then cover the whole with the crust. Serve hot. 

STEAK AND PLOVER PIE. Line basin with paste ; then put in a 
slice of rump steak well seasoned with salt and pepper over a plover 
with the bird inside and dressed as for roasting, another steak over 
it, all seasoned with salt and pepper only. Add a gill of beef gravy, 
then cover with paste and boil 11-2 hours. The flavor of the plover 
will make the steak delicious. 

GREEN GOOSE PIE. Bone two young green geese of good size, 
but first take away every pin-feather and singe them nicely ; wash 
them clean and season them high with salt, pepper, mace and al- 
spice ; put one inside the other and press them as close as you can, 
drawing the legs inward. Put a good deal of butter over them and 
bake them either with or without crust ; if the latter, a cover to the 
dish must fit close to keep in the steam. It will keep long. 

PIGEON PIE. If it be eaten hot, have a rich, flakey crust; if in- 
tended to be eaten cold, a thick crust is preferable, but should be 
equally rich, or nearly so. Butter the dish and lay a crust round the 
sides and on the edges; at the bottom of the dish a fine beefsteak 
seasoned with pepper and salt ; then the birds rubbed with pepper 
and salt inside and out, and a piece of butter in each. (Some prefer 



308 MEAT AND SAVORY PIES. 

to add the liver chopped up with parsley.) Lay the breasts downward, 
to keep them juicy, a litttle ham is laid on each pigeon and a hard- 
boiled egg between each two ; but neither of these is necessary, and 
by some persons are considered no improvement. Putin half pint of 
gravy or broth and have ready a little more to pour in boiling hot at 
an aperture in the top of the pie, when it comes out of the oven. 
Season the gizzards, and, if you cut them off, two joints of the pin- 
ions, and lay them in the middle of the dish ; lay on the top crust 
and make a hole in the center, wherein may be stuck some of the 
feet nicely cleaned. Wash the crust with the yolk of an egg well 
beaten. One hour and a half will bake a pigeon pie, unless very 
large indeed. 

GIBLET PIE. After very nicely cleansing goose or duck giblets 
stew them with a small quantity of water, onion, black pepper and a 
bunch of sweet herbs till nearly done; let them grow cold, and if not 
enough to fill the dish, lay a beef, veal or two mutton steaks at the 
bottom, or more. Put the liquor of the stew to bake with the above, 
and when the pie is baked pour into it a large teacupful of cream. 
Sliced potatoes added toil eat extremely well. 

LOBSTER PIE. Boil 2 or 3 small lobsters, remove the tails, cut 
them in two, take out the insides, divide each into 4 pieces, lay them 
in a small dish, then put in the meat of the claws and that which has 
been picked from the body, clear the latter of the finny parts and 
take out the substance, beat the spawn in a mortar, do the same 
by the shells, set them on to stew with some water, 2 or 4 spoonfuls 
of vinegar, pepper, salt and pounded mace, and add a piece of but- 
ter rolled in flour ; when the goodness of the shell is extracted give 
the whole a good boiling and strain it into the dish ; strew some 
crumbs over it and cover it with a paste. Bake it slowly and take 
it out as soon as the crust is done. 

OYSTER PIE. Take out the liquor in opening the oysters, strain, 
beard and parboil the fish ; do the same with sweet breads, which 
last must be cut in slices and disposed with oysters in layers, seasoned 
lightly with salt or not, pepper and mace. Put 1-2 teacupful of 
the liquor and as much gravy into the dish ; cover the oysters with 
crust and bake the pie in a slow oven. On taking it out add a cup- 
ful of cream, some nice oyster liquor and a cupful of white gravy, 
warm, but not boiling. 

MINCED PIE WITHOUT MEAT OR APPLES. One teacup seeded raisins, 
i teaspoonful molasses, i teacup sugar, i teacup water, 1-2 teacup 
cider vinegar, 1-2 teacup melted butter, 3 soda crackers rolled, 1-2 
teaspoonful cloves, i teaspoonful cinnamon. 

MINCED PIES. Boil 4 Ibs. lean beef and chop it fine. Pick and

chopped round of beef, i Ib. suet nicely sliced, i dozen apples pared 
and chopped small, 2 Ibs. raisins or currants stoned and floured, 3-4 
Ib. sugar with nutmeg, mace and cloves. Dried cherries will do. 
Mix all together. Stir in sweet cider, French or peach brandy. Slice

MOCK MINCE PIES FOR SUMMER USE. It is made by mixing one 
cup each of sugar and molasses and i 1-2 cup bread crumbs, i cup 
good cider vinegar, 4 cups water, 3 eggs. Add i cup raisins, i oz.

APPLE PIE. Wipe the outside of the fruit, which pare and core, 
and with the cores boil with a little water till it boils well, strain 
and put in a little sugar and a bit of bruised cinnamon and simmer 
again. In the meantime place the apples in a dish, a paste being 
put around the edge ; when one layer is in sprinkle 1-2 the sugar and 
shred lemon peel and squeeze some juice or a glass of cider if the 
apples have lost their spirit ; put in the rest of the apples, sugar and 
the liquor that you have boiled, cover with paste. You may add 
some butter when cut if eaten hot, or put quince marmalade, orange 
paste or cloves to flavor. 

A TURN-OVER APPLE OR PEACH PIE. Put the fruit, that is, apples 
< r peaches pared, cored and cut up, in a deep dish, then put a short

crust over the top and bake it When done turn the crust over on 
a deep plate or dish. Mash the fruit, sugar and season to taste and 
paste the crust with it. 

SLICED APPLE, PEACH, APRICOT, QUINCE AND PEAR PIES. Are 
made by slicing very thinly the fruit and put them in a deep pie 
plate or dish lined with thin pie paste, over which is pasted a layer 
of butter in bits, then put in a layer of fruit sprinkled with coriander 
seeds or any other spice or spices, then a layer of butter and a thin 
sprinkle of the flavoring lemon peel, &c., and then a layer of fruit, 
and so on till full, then a cup of water thick with sugar, so as to form 
a syrup, which should be poured in. Some persons put the sugar 
between each layer and put all the seasoning on the top ; then put a 
transparent puff paste, pinch off, perforate and bake 50 minutes in 
a moderate oven. It is best for the fruit to be mellow and juicy. 

GREEN APPLES, GOOSEBERRIES, CURRANTS AND APRICOTS should 
be boiled with sugar before making pies of them. The greener they 
are the more sugar they require. The apricots should not be larger 
than a full-sized gooseberry, otherwise the skins become bitter and 
the stones hard. When cooking flavor to suit with coriander, any 
spices approved, lemon or orange peel grated. When put in the 
pie dish put butter in bits, and finely chopped citron, if conven- 
ient, and some currants or raspberries or thin jellies, or marma- 
lades will bean improvement. They will require but little baking, 
as do all pies made of cooked fruits. 

APPLE PIE. For 3 pies pare 1 2 good-sized apples and slice them 
thin, then prepare. the crust and place it in the pans; lay the apples 
in and sprinkle over them very neatly 2 tablespoonfuls of flour ; 
to each pie i gill of sugar, a piece of butter the size of a small hick- 
ory nut and i gill of cold water. Spice to taste ; add the top crust and 
bake. Use nutmeg, allspice or cinnamon, as your taste fancies, or 
sprinkle over 1-2 teaspoonful of coriander seeds. Select good cook- 
ing apples. 

N. B. As soon as pies are baked they should have a little water 
shaken over them and white sugar grated on immediately. 

HOT APPLE PIE. Make with the fruit ; sugar and cloves, and put 
a bit of butter in when cut open. 

APPLE PIE, &c. This is boiled between crusts, which should be 
rich, the under one thinner and the upper one thicker and richer. 
Peel, core and slice your apples, place them on the under crust on 
the pie plate, then a layer of sugar, butter and spice ; then another 
layer of apples, and so repeat until the fruit is used ; a layer of su- 
gar and butter and grated lemon peel ; a sprinkle of cinnamon the 
last, then put on the upper crust, pick it with a fork and bake slowly. 

APPLE PIE. Take a sufficient number of apples to make a pie 



MEAT AND SAVORY PIES. 

of the required size, pare, core and slice them ; put a teacup in the 
middle of your dish, then allow i pinch of cinnamon, a small piece 
of chopped lemon peel and cloves to every 3.apples and sweeten to 
taste. Bake. 

APPLE PIE. After paring, dividing and coring the desired quan- 
tity of apples, fill a dish, placing a small teacup in the center, if you 
wish, then to every 3 apples allow i clove, a pinch of cinnamon, a 
little beaten lemon peel and sugar to suit and bake. A little whipped 
cream should be placed on the top for variety sake. 

WHOLE PEACH PIE. Take small, plump, not quite ripe peaches, 
peel them without cutting them, then line a dish with puff paste, 
lay the fruit close together, put in a little water for a medium-sized 
pie, strew over a teacup of sugar, dredge a little flour over, grate 1-2 
nutmeg or more, a large pinch of salt, put the crust on, cut a slit in 
the center. Bake one hour in a hot oven. 

CHERRY, DAMSON, Rhubarb, Gooseberry, Currant, Plum, Apple, 
Whortleberry, Raspberry, Pear, Quince, Mulberry, Currant, Cran- 
berry, Dewberry and Blackberry pies may all be made in the same 
way in cold weather. 

CHERRY PIE. Should have 4 mixture of other fruit ; currants or 
raspberries or both. 

BLACKBERRY, RASPBERRY AND WHORTLEBERRY PIES. Are made 
by stewing the fruit in a preserving pan with sugar and spices to taste. 
When the fruit is put in the dish lined with paste drop over it bits 
of butter and a little citron chopped finely, if you have it, then 
put on the top crust made richly, perforate, glaze and bake it till 
of a light brown. Eaten cold with ice-cold milk or custard. Damson 
and plum pies are made in this way. 

LKMON PIKS (Extra nice.) Ten tablespoons sugar, yolks of 
5 ^ggs, 2 tablespoonfuls corn starch in i cup of milk, i large spoon- 
ful of butter, 2 grated lemons put in the crust and baked, then 
beat the whites well, add 5 spoonfuls white sugar, put on top of the 
pie. Bake in the oven 5 minutes. This will make two beautiful 
pies. 

BUTTER PIE. Cover a pie plate with a crust, as for custard pie, 
take a piece of butter the size of an egg, 2-3 cup of sugar, one 
cup of cream, sweet and thick, i tablespoonful of flour. Stir but- 
ter, flour and sugar together, then stir in the cream, pour in the 
pie plates. Bake until brown. Mrs. Arnold. 

PUMPKIN PIE. Take the^pumpkin which has stewed down to 
form a thick mash, put it in a bowl with milk and eggs beaten up, 
and stir it well until very thick. (The pumpkin here being strained 
through a colander or hair sieve.) For a family pie put 3 eggs to i 
quart of milk. The more eggs the better the pie, and if you wish

it richer make it thinner and add sweet cream and 2 eggs more ; two 
teaspoonfuls of sifted cinnamon and I of powdered ginger, but all- 
spice may be used or any other spices that may be prepared. The 
peel of lemon or orange gives it a pleasant flavor. Some put i egg 
to a gill of cream. Bake i hour in deep plates or shallow dishes in 
a hot oven. 

SQUASH PIE. (Liverpool Steamer's recipe.) Two "quarts each of 
sifted squash and new milk, 6 well beaten eggs, stir well, flavor wifr v 
nutmeg or lemon to the taste.

little water as possible till soft, then squeeze through a colander, then 
stir as much sweet milk into the squash so as to make it thick as 
batter ; grated ginger, nutmeg and cinnamon. Sweeten with sugar, 
add 2 or 3 eggs well whisked for each quart of milk used. Line

A FINE FISH PIE. Boil 2 pounds of small eels, cut the fins off 
close, pick off the flesh and put the bones with mace, pepper, salt 
and a sliced onion into the liquor, boil the whole till rich and then 
strain it. Make forcemeat of the flesh, a sprot or herring, parsley, 
lemon peel, salt, pepper, crumbs, i cup of butter warmed. Lay all 
this at the bottom of the dish. Take the flesh of some nice fish, 
small cod or trout and lay it on the forcemeat after rubbing in salt 
and pepper ; pour the gravy over the pie and bake it. The fins and 
skins must be carefully removed. 

EEL PIE. Wash and trim them well, cut them in pieces of three 
inches in length, season with pepper and salt and fill the dish, omit- 
ting the heads and tails; pour in a glass of water or veal broth, 
cover it with paste, mix the same with a brush dipped in the yolk of 
an egg, ornament the pie with some paste, bake it an hour, and when 
clone pour in sauce made as follows: The trimmings boiled in 1-2 
pint of veal gravy seasoned with pepper and salt, a tablespoonful of 
lemon juice and thicken with flour and water ; strain it through a 
fine sieve and let it be boiling hot when put into the pie. 

SAVOY PIE. Scald and remove the inner portions of the fish ; 
when well washed and dried make a forcemeat as follows : Take the

314 MEAT AND SAVORY PIES. 

lay the fish in the dish, add a little beaten mace, some butter and 
1-2 pint of claret; cover the pie and bake it in a moderate oven. 

SALMON PIE. About 4 pounds are required. Cut into thin slices 
separately with peppei*, salt and a very little mace. Pound a pint of 
shrimps with an ounce of butter and mould into small balls. Mix 
with a piece of salmon. Boil down the bones and skin of the fish 
into a jelly and fill up the dish. Cover with good paste and bake an 
hour. 

MOUNTAIN TROUT PIE. Wash and prepare a large mountain 
trout, then take an eel and boil it till nearly tender, pick off the meat 
and mince it fine with the same quantity of crumbs of bread, some 
sweet herbs, lemon peel cut small, pepper, salt, grated nutmeg, a 
herring, 1-2 pint of oysters par-boiled and chopped fine and the 
yolks of 3 hard eggs cut small. Roll this mixture with 1-4 pound 
of butter and fill the trout. Cover the dish with a crust and lay the 
fish therein. Save the liquor in which the eel was boiled, put the 
bones into it, and boil the whole with mace, whole pepper, i onion 
(sweet), i herring or spot, till reduced to 1-2 pint. Strain it and add 
i -4 pint of white wine and a piece of butter mixed with flour. Boil 
this and pour it into the pie, put on the cover and bake it i hour in 
a quick oven. Rock fish, soles and halibut may be done in the same 
manner, only using port wine instead of white wine or claret. 

FISH PIES can be made like the Old Virginia pot pie. They are 
very good. Only large fish are used. 

FISH PIE. Boil a large Rock fish, pick it up, add to it 3 eggs, 3 
spoonfuls of butter, i of flour and make it into a batter with milk ; 
add pepper and salt to taste. Bake between crusts, or one, in a 
pan. 

GAME PIE, FLY AWAY. (Liverpool and Steamer Cook) Make 
your game pie in a mould for the purpose ; with a mould also for the 
purpose covered with paste and baked with the pie ; then over the 
cold pies cut white paper to fit the top of the pie ; several thicknesses 
over it, then put in some live birds under the top standing on the 
white paper. Persons not knowing the secret will hear the chirping 
and twitting of the birds and not know where they are. When the 
dish is to be help the waiter will remove the top and the birds fly 
away. The papers removed . with the top at once and the pie 
served. To some it may be amusing. 

SQUAB PIE. Cut apples as for other pies and lay them in rows 
with mutton chops, chopped onions and sprinkle it among them and 
some butter with the squabs cut in pieces. 

SQUAB PIE A NEW HAMPSHIRE WAY. Take 12 nicely cleaned 
squabs, then mix up to a thick paste 6 heaped teaspoonfuls each of 
sweet fresh butter and flour, then into each bird put half a teaspoon- 



MEAT AND SAVORY PIES. 315 

ful of the mixture, then place the birds into a baking pan, sprinkle 
over them salt and pepper to suit, then have ready a nice rich and 
thick pie crust and put over and rather slowly bake a nice brown. 
Then cut the crust in slices with long corners and turn the underside 
upon a plate and on each slice place one of the birds for each per- 
son (with a spoon), and some of the gravy. All should be served 
hot. 

NOTE. Other birds and most pies can be made in the same way, 
only more butter. 

LEMON Pi R Six lemons grated, 8 eggs, 2 coffee cups of white 
sugar ; beat the eggs thoroughly, reserving the whites of 2 Then 
mix and stir all together till perfectly smooth ; put the mixture on a 
crust ; then beat the 2 whites to a solid foam and put it on the top 
for frosting and bake a very delicate brown. 

ORANGE PIES are made in the same manner, using the best white 
sugar. No flavoring is required for either. 

ACID PIE (Bingham). One cup soft bread or crackers, r cup 
sugar, 2 cups water, a little lemon, i egg, i teaspoonful tartaric acid. 
Bake on one crust. N. B. The French use a great deal of butter 
in cooking. 

VINEGAR PiE; A cupful each of good fruit vinegar and sugar ; 
boil together in a porcelain kettle and let it cool ; add i or 2 well- 
beaten eggs with a tablespoonful of butter. Bake between 2 crusts. 
If the vinegar is very strong use 1-2 cup of vinegar and 1-2 cupful 
water. Flavor to taste. 

SLICED POTATO PIES (A Southern Dessert). For this take a 
deep soup plate to bake it in. Boil or bake medium-sized sweet po- 
tatoes not quite done; yams are consideree the best. Line the plate 
with a rich pie paste; slice the potatoes in thin, long chips and place 
a layer at the bottom of the plate, over this spread a thick layer of 
nice brown sugar, over this place thin slices of butter or in slugs and 
sprinkle with flour, seasoning with spices to taste. A large teaspoon- 
ful each of butter and flour will be sufficient for one pie. Put on 
another layer of potatoes heaped a litttle in the middle, so as to give 
it a swell in the center. Mix together equal quantities of the best 
wine (California will do) and water, or sweet cider, or vinegar 
nnd water, or a little brandy diluted with water. Pour in enough to 
half-fill the pies, sprinkle over them a little flour and place on the 
upper crust, pinching the edges carefully together. Cut a hole in 
the center or stick with a fork the upper crust. Bake slowly for i 
hour. 

N. B. In making the above pie I always sprinkle some finely 
pulverized spices that may be prepared between each layer. Cori- 
nder seems to be a suitable spice for this pie.

SWEET AND DELICATE DISHES. 

GOLDEN CUPS. One' quart of milk, 3 good tablespoonfula of 
rice boiled and stand to cool, 2 ounces of butter; put on your 
milk to boil, mix the rice very smooth with some cold milk; as 
soon as the former begins to boil, stir in the latter and let the 
whole boil for 20 minutes. In the meantime prepare a small mus- 
lin bag of saffron and boil with the compound, then remove it 
after having colored the rice a gold color; whilst the milk is warm 
add the butter and a little salt ; rinse your custard cup with cold 
water, 1-2 fill them with the mixture; when it becomes cold, then 
turn out of the cups and retain their forms. They are very orna- 
mental to the table. To be eaten with cream and a little grated 
nutmeg. Rose-colored or green cups may be produced in the 
same way by substituting a little cochineal for the rose color 
and spinach juice for the green color, in place of saffron flowers. 

CINNAMON STARS. Stir together for 1-2 hour 1-2 Ib. of coarsly- 
pounded almonds, 1-2 ounce of cinnamon and the whites ot three 
eggs beaten to a froth ; strew some sugar and cinnamon mixed to- 
gether over the froth board, turn out the mass upon it, roll this out 
with the mixed flour and sugar to twice the thickness of the back of 
a knife ; cut out of this stars with a paste cutter (mould) for this 
purpose in the shape of a star, put them on a baking plate coated 
with wax, and continue in this way till you have used all your paste. 
Before putting the stars into the oven wash them over with beaten- 
up egg and dip them into mixed sugar and cinnamon. 

GATEUX D'EPICE. The peculiarity of the French ginger-bread is 
delicate flavor of the vanilla. Pour over the fire i pound of treacle, 
6 ounces of butter, i ounce of powdered ginger, i ounce of pow- 
dered cinnamon, i ounce of pounded cardamon, i ounce each of 
candied lemon and orange peel in shavings, and 1-2 pod of vanilla 
pounded with a tablespoonful of brandy ; stir the mixture well and 
simmer for 5 minutes, then pour it out of the pan, and when cool 
beat it by degrees in as much flour as you can knead into a smooth 
paste ; bake on buttered tins in small cakes or nuts in a slow oven 
for 3-4 hour- 

ANGEL'S FOOD. (Miss White.) Beat the whites of 6 eggs to a 
froth, a tablespoonful of powdered sugar, into it beat jelly to give 
it a pretty color, whip a pint of cream sweetened and seasoned to 
taste. Pour the preparation over and serve with the cake. 

A BEAUTIFUL DISH. On the top of a flat cake pour first a layer 
of the white of an egg beaten with white pounded sugar very evenly, 
let it remain for a moment to become settled, then put on the 






SWKET AND DELICATE DISHES. 323 

same egg colored with a little cochineal, then another layer of the 
same colored with saffron, then another colored with the green 
juice of spinach, then another colored with finely powdered cho- 
colate. Each layer should remain a moment or two before an- 
other is added, and flavored differently to fancy ; then begin again 
with white and repeat the process, then finish with a white layer, 
and over this strew veins of each color of the egg and sugar 
froth in any figure from a teaspoon, then put a round dress of 
each in different places ; then set for a moment in a cool stove 
or oven to harden. Then in slicing the cake it will appear as 
though covered with a beautiful strata. Then put here and there 
fragments of sparkling jelly. 

ROCK WORK. Made of beef carved so as to resemble the wash- 
ing of the waves of the ocean through a rock Then lay on red 
jelly, then streaks of yellow and brown jelly, then parsley minced 
very fine to resemble green moss, over which sprinkle the yellow 
and white of eggs chopped fine and separately, then jelly of differ- 
colors moulded so as to represent black, grey and yellow snails, as 
if sticking to the rock interspersed over it. This rock resting on 
green and gold jelly to represent the waves of the sea, being laid in 
an uneven way. The green should be made of spinach or mint 
juice. A little white of an egg beaten to a froth may be dropped 
around the back to represent foam. Dark-colored jelly of choco- 
late in drops larger or smaller, may represent pebbles. A broken 
pillar is represented by a piece of veal cut in that shape, or blanc 
mange moulded in that form, overgrown with flowers (may be nat- 
ural or artificial ones), with moss made as the above in rock work, 
with rustic steps, and fragments lying around. 

FRANGJPONE. This delicious, creamy material, is much used in 
French cookery, for tartlets, with fruits or biscuits, and in various 
confections, and is made immediately before using, as below. 

Beat up very well, 6 eggs and put them into a stew-pan, with 3 
tablespoonfuls of fine, very dry flour, 2 ozs. of bruised macaroons, 3 
ozs. sugar, on which the rind of a lemon has been rubbed, a table- 
spoonful of orange flower water, and a pint of new milk. Stir gently 
over a slow fire for 20 minutes, never allowing it to boil, and when 
thickened, it is ready for use. Poured over baked apples, pears, 
quinces, etc., this makes an excellent entrement. 

FRENCH MACAROONS. Pound in a mortar very fine, i Ib. of sweet 
almonds, with whites of eggs, be careful they do not oil, then mix the 
almonds and whites of eggs with 3 Ibs of powdered loaf sugar to a 
fine thickness, so as to come off the spoon well, then put 3 sheets of 
paper on your plate, and with a tablespoon, drop them oft at a little 
distance from each other, so as not to touch, put them in rather a 



324 SWEET AND DELICATE DISHES. 

brisk oven, but mind they do not burn ; bake them a very fine brown 
color, and crisp ; then let them stand till cold, betore you take them 
off; but if they are burnt at the bottom, they will not come off at all, 
so you must be careful of them. 

A BIRO'S NEST. Make some clear jelly, of an amber color, and 
fill a small, broad basin 1-2 full. Have some birds' eggs blown, fill 
them with blanc-mange ; when the latter is quite cold, peel off the 
shells, and it represents small eggs. Put some moss around a glass 
dish, turn the jelly out and stand it in the middle, lay some lemon 
peel, cut in thin strips, to represent straws, on the jelly, and place 
the eggs on the top. 

SNOW BALLS. Swell 1-2 a Ib. of rice in water with a roll of lemon 
peel, till tender, drain it, divide it; having pared and cored apples, 
and the holes filled with sugar and cinnamon, and cloves, put the rice 
around them, tying each up in a cloth, tightly. Boil the rice and 
serve with pudding sauce. If approved, the rice may be boiled in 
milk. 

RICE AND APPLES. Boil 1-2 a Ih. of rice with i pint of cream or 
milk, with lemon peel and a bit of cinnamon ; let it boil, till the rice 
is dry, then cool it. Raise a rim, 3 inches high round the dish ; hav- 
ing egged the dish when it is put in, to make it stick ; then egg the 
rice all over, after mixing it well with a spoonful of butter and 2 
spoonfuls of sugar. Fill the dish half ways up with a marmalade of 
apples, have ready the whites of 4 eggs, beaten to a stiff froth, and 
and put them over the marmalade, then sift fine sugar over it and set 
it in the oven, which should be warm enough to give a beautiful color; 
or cover the marmalade with the rice, garnish with apple jelly, and 
pour custard over it. 

CURDS AND CREAMS. When the milk is curdled firmly, fill up a 
melon, or any shape, perforated with holes to let the whey drain off. 
Fill up the dish as the curd sinks ; turn it out when wanted, and 
serve with cream in a glass dish, or a whip may be poured about 
the curd, which may be made firm by squeezing, or long standing. 
Garnish with currant jelly, or raspberry jam, 

VOLAUVENT OF PEACHES ( French.) Put 4 ozs. sugar into a stew-pan 
with a cupful of water, and the juice of a lemon, let it boil on the fire 
till it forms a thick syrup, then take 8 right white Heath peaches, free 
stone, not quite ripe, (cling stone Heath are very good) cut them in 
two, break the stones, take out the kernels, scald them, throw 6 halves 
of them into the boiling syrup, and let them remain 3 minute, then 
with a perforated skimmer take them out, lay them on a dish and re- 
move the skins ; stew the remainder, 4 at a time, in like manner ; 
when all are done, pour the syrup that runs from them, again into 
pan, then boil the liquid down to a proper thickness ; then strain 



SWEET AND DELICATE DISHES. 32$ 

through flannel or a straining cloth into a bowl ; let it stand till cold, 
when pour over the peaches, let remain until ready to serve, then fill 
your volanvent with peaches and pour the syrup over. NOTE. Any 
kind of peaches will do, but the white Heath are the best. 

VOLAUVENT OF ORANGES. Remove the peel and pith well from 8 
oranges, then divide them into as many pieces as there are sections, 
put them into a porcelain kettle, with 3 ozs. of sugar aud the juice of 
i 1-2 oranges; cover over and set on a slow fire, stirring occasion- 
ally with a silver spoon. It requires only 10 or 12 minutes, then, 
with the spoon, take out each piece separately into a bowl, then boil 
the syrup down to a proper thickness. When ready to serve, pour 
the syrup over the pieces of orange. 

SWEET SOUFFLE. Take i pint of milk and as much flour, as will 
come to a thick paste over the stove ; keep stirring all the time, and 
add 6 yolks of eggs, and a pinch of salt, and as much sugar as you 
like. Beat 8 whites of eggs all to a froth and stir them all together; 
put in the oven 1-4 hour before wanting it ; the oven must be quick. 
Glaze it with white sugar, and send it quickly to the table. It may 
be made of ground rice. The rind of a lemon, grated, or lemon 
juice, gives it a nice flavor. 

SOUFFLE OF POTATOES WITH LEMON. Roast 10 potatoes ; when 
they are done, open them and take out the pulp, and mix it with 1-2 
pint of cream, add some butter, a pinch of salt, and a little lump of 
sugar, not too much, lest the souffle should not be light, but enough 
to give it a flavor ; add the yolks of 4 eggs to the above, then beat 
the whites of 6 eggs, and mix with the rest. Pour it gently into a 
dish, and bake in a moderate oven. When done, sift a little sugar 
over it and brown with a salamander. It should be served imme- 
diately. 

PYRAMIDS OF MERINGUES. Make the meringues heart-shaped or 
circular, then form a circle of the desired size by glueing the merin- 
gues together with the wh;te of egg or gumarabic and sugar ; let this 
dry a little, then gradually draw the circle smaller, until you arrive 
at an entire closure. These are very ornamental on a party table. 

CORN STARCH MERINGUE (R. H.'s recipe.) Four eggs, i quart 
of milk, 3-4 cup of sugar, 4 teaspoontuls of corn starch, 1-2 cup of 
IV .lit jelly or jam. Heat the milk to boiling and and stir in the corn 
starch, which has been previously dissolved in a little cold milk, boil 
15 minutes, stirring all the while; remove from the fire, and while 
still hot add gradually the yolks of the eggs beaten up with sugar 
and seasoned with vanilla, lemon or bitter almond. Pour this into 
a buttered pudding dish and bake 1-4 hour, or until the custard be- 
gins to set. without withdrawing it further than the door of the 
oven spread lightly and quickly upon this a meringue of the whites

whipped up stiff with 1-2 cup of jelly add gradually. Use crab 
apple jelly if bitter almonds have been put into the custard ; cur- 
rant for vanilla, strawberry, or any other sweet conserve, if you 
season the custard with lemon. Bake covered for 5 minutes, then 
remove the lid and brown the meringue very slightly. Eat cold 
with powdered sugar sifted over the top. 

QUEEN OF TRIFLES (Mrs. H.'s.) One-half pound of lady-fin- 
gers or square sponge cakes, 1-2 pound of macaroons, the same 
of sweet almonds blanched, the same of crystalized fruit chopped 
fine, T cup sweet jelly or jam, i glass of brandy, i glass of the best 
sherry, rose water, i pint of cream whipped, i pint of rich milk for 
custard, 4 eggs, whites and yolks separated, i tablespoonful of corn 
starch, i small cupful sugar for custard, a little powdered sugar for 
whipped cream, vanilla flavoring for custard; put sponge cakes at 
the bottom of a large glass dish, wet with brandy, and cover thinly 
with jelly. Strew the mixed fruit thickly upon this. 

LEMON TRIFLES. (Mrs. H.) Delicious. Two lemons, juice of 
both, and grated rind of i ; 2 cups sherry, i large cup of sugar, i 
pint cream well sweetened and whipped stiff, a little nutmeg; strain 
the lemon juice over the sugar and grated peel, and let them lie to- 
gether 2 hours before adding the wine and nutmeg. Strain again, 
and whip gradually into the frothed cream ; serve in jelly glasses 
and send around cake with it. It should not be allowed to stand, but 
eaten as soon as made. 

FLOATING ISLANDS. (Revolutionary recipe.) My dear old great 
grandmother's. Beat 4 eggs to a solid foam, after putting 2 table- 
spoonfuls each of currant jelly and raspberry jam ; continue to beat 
until it is thoroughly incorporated. In the meantime, or before you 
beat the eggs, lay in the bottom of a pretty china dessert dish some 
Naples biscuit or thin slices of sponge cake, cover with sweetmeats 
and cream or rich new milk, and then pile the egg froth on this as 
high as you can. You may employ bits of preserves beaten with 
the egg instead of the jam, and you can use only one kind of jelly 
or jam, as you may please. This was a famous dish at wedding sup- 
suppers, parties, Xmas dinners, and all grand festive occasions, by 
our revolutionary grandmas in the old Dominion. 

SAN FRANCISCO SYLLABUB. One quart of cream, i pint best Cali- 
fornia white wine, the juice of a California lemon, i large orange or 
2 small ones with a large glass of brandy, i gill of orange flower 
water and pounded sugar to taste. Beat it up well, and as the froth 
rises take it off and lay it on the back of a sieve to drain ; if it does 
not rise well add the whites of 2 eggs. When done enough put a 
little of the liquor into a glass and grate thereon some nutmeg and 
fill them 1-2 with froth. It may be colored with cochineal or by 
using red instead of white wine. 



SWEET AND DELICATE DISHES. 327 

COFFEE CHARLOTTE RUSSE. Line a mould with finger biscuits, 
as above, roast 1-2 pound of green coffee in a coffee pan, boil i 
quart of cream, put the coffee in it, and let it stand in a warm place 
for an hour ; put 8 yolks of eggs in a stew pan with 3-4 pounds of 
pounded sugar, strain in the coffee cream and stir over the fire until 
the eggs begins to thicken. Steep i ounce of gelatine in cold wa- 
ter, drain, and add it to cream ; stir till the gelatine is melted, strain 
through a hair sieve into' a basin and stir the cream on the ice until 
it begins to thicken ; add i quart of well whipped cream, and finish 
th charlotte as directed in the preceding recipe. 

APPLE CHARLOTTE. Peal and core 20 large, ripe, plump apples 
cut them in thin slices, put them in a sauie pan, 
with some butter and pounded sugar, and toss them over the fire 
till they are done; Line a plain mould with bread, as follows; cut 
some thin slices of bread crumb; cut it rou.id, i 1-2 inch cutter, to 
put in the center, then cut some heart-shaped pieces, and dip them 
in butter, together with the round piece; put the latter at the bottom 
of the mould, in the center; and place the heart shaped pieces 
around it, over-laping one another ; fill the center with the cooked 
apples and put the Charlotte in the oven until the bread is well 
colored. Turn the Charlotte out of the mould on a dish; glaze it 
over with some boiled appricot jam ; and serve. 

PEAR CHARLOTTE. Line the mould with bread as for apple 
charlotte; peal 15 rather large, ripe and plump California pears, cut 
them in quarters and cook them in a sauce-pan with some butter 
and loaf sugar ; fill the mould with pears, put the Charlotte to color 
in the oven ; turn it, cut and glaze it over with jam to fancy. 

EGG BLANC MANGE. Take 2-3 box of gelatine and 4 1-2 cups of 
sweet milk, pour the gelatine in a quart of milk and set it in the back 
of the stove to dissolve the gelatine, then add a coffee cup of white 
sugar while the milk is heating, beat the yolks of 6 eggs, 
add half cup of milk to them, and when the milk is scalding hot, put 
the eggs in flour with vanilla or extract of lemon. Stir carefully one 
way until it is done, which will be in a few minutes. If it remains 
over the fire too long, it will curdle. Three minutes will be long 
enough to scald it. Take from the fire ; continue to sjir it gently 
until it is quite cool Then rinse a mould and stir the mixture into 
it ; put in ice. Eaten with sweet cream. 

ORANGK SNOW. Four large Mandarine oranges, juice of all and 
the peel of one, juice and the grated peel of one lime, i package 
of the best gelatine soaked in 2 gills of water. The whites of five 
eggs, beaten to a solid froth, i coffee cup heaped with sugar 
(powdered) and 2 cups of boiling water. Mix the juice and peel of 
the oranges and lime with the soaked gelatine, add the sugar ; stir 



328 CREAMS. 

all up well and let them alone for one hour, then pour on the boiling 
water, and stir until clear. Strain through a coarse cloth, pressing 
and wringing it hard, when quite cold, whip into this frothed whites 
gradually, until thick and white. 1'ut into a wet mould for 8 hours. 
CHOCOLATE CREAM. Put into a small stewpan a pint of milk and 
6 ounces of pounded sugar, make it very hot and then stir in it 
1-2 pint of made chocolate, and the beaten yolks of seven eggs. Put 
it into a jug, stand it in a sauce pan of boiling water and stir it until 
it becomes rather thick, but do not let it boil, then strain it through 
muslin, and strain in it a large cupful of cream, put it into a mould 
previously dipped into cold water, and set the mould on ice to set. 

CREAMS. 

VELVET CRKAM. To a pint of cream put a very little sugar, keep 
stirring over the fire, till the sugar is dissolved, and then take it off, 
but keep on stirring, till it is about the warmth of new milk, after 
which pour it through a fine colander into a dish containing 3 spoon- 
fuls of lemon or orange juice, a little grated peel, and a little fruit 
marmalade, chopped small, with 2 spoonfuls of white wine. This 
should be prepared the evening before it is wanted. 

ORANGE CREAM. Dissolve i oz. of isinglass and 6 ozs. of loaf 
sugar in a pint of boiling milk, having first rubbed off the rind of 5 
oranges with some of the lumps of sugar. Extract the juice of the 
oranges, and then strain the isinglass and other ingredients into it ; 
add i gill of cream and the yolks of 4 eggs, which must be well 
beaten ; pour the whole into a sauce-pan, and warm it over the fire, 
but do not allow it to boil ; pour into a jug and stir until cold, before 
you put it into a mold. 

ICE CREAM. Take one quart of pure cream, and take 3-4 of a 
pound of fine sugar, and take 4 eggs, and put that all on the fire and 
keep stirring till it grows thick ; put a spoon in it, and when you put 
the spoon in it, lift the spoon up, and if it drops from the spoon it is 
cooked, but you must not let it boil. Put it in a freezer and flavor 
with the essence of vanilla, or if it is convenient, put a vanilla bean 
split, in the milk or cream and let it boil ; then you freeze it with ice 
and coarse salt. 

NEAPOLITAN ICE-CREAM. Rub well together, 12 eggs and i 1-4 
pounds of white sifted sugar, and 2 quarts of perfectly fresh and pure 
cream, flavor as below named, and cook in a farina boiler, (a tin 
vessel, set into a larger one, containing hot water) stirring constantly, 
until it thickens, but it must not curdle. Strain through a fine sieve 
and put it on ice to cool. As there is "reason in the cooking of 
eggs," so the cooking of ice-cream demands care and skill ; it may 



HONEY. 329 

be as readily undone or overdone, as a beefsteak or an oyster stew. 
I will suppose you use Tingley's freezer, which I find superior to any 
other. Pour the cream into the freezing can, put in the dasher, 
cover and fasten, then break up your ice with a wooden mallet, in 
any heavy, coarse cloth, old coffee sack or the like, to the size of a 
walnut, and pack firmly around the can, adding coarsly ground salt, 
until the tub is entirely full. A 4 quart can requires 25 pounds of ice 
and i quart of salt. Cover and fasten the tub, and freeze according 
to the directions accompanying each freezer, observing the more 
slowly the work is done, the firmer and smoother will be the product. 
If a large bulk of light, snowy cream is desired, turn the dasher as 
rapidly as possible ; what is gained in volume, is lost in quality. If 
beaten rapidly at first, or if beaten at all. before the cream is entirely 
chilled, small grains of butter will appear diffused through the mass. 
When the freezing is completed, open the can, remove the dasher, 
pack the cream firmly down, replace the cover, drain off the water, 
fill the tub with salt and ice in the proportions given, cover with a 
woolen blanket, and let it stand several hours to harden, or ripen. 

HONEY. 

HONEY LIQUORICE (Hamb Ph.) Honey and a strong infusion of 
liquorice boiled to a proper consistency. Excellent for a cold or 
cough. 

HONEY OF BORAX. Powdered broax i drachm, clarified honey i 
oz. ; mix. Astringent, detersive and cooling, it is employed in sore 
mouth and excessive salvation. 

GRAPE HONEY. Formerly -used by Arabians and Persians, and 
is still prepared in many portions of Syria and Palistine, by boiling 
the must down to 1-3 and sometimes only to 1-2. In this way grape 
jelly is found. According to Pliny the proper season for boiling is the 
autumnal Equinox, in the night when there is no moon, or if it is 
full moon in the day time. In Palestine and many parts of Syria, 
especially in the neighborhood of Hebron, it is exported in great 
quantities to Egypt. 

N OTE When diluted with a little water it is frequently used in- 
stead of sugar, or a substitute for butter, and is sometimes applied 
to heal wounds. 

OBSERVATIONS Why cannot the grapes be so used in Califor- 
nia? 

ARTIFICIAL HONEY. Soft water 6 pounds; best pure honey 3 
pounds ; white moist sugar 20 pounds ; cream of tartar 80 grains ; 
essence of roses 20 drops ; mix the above in a brass kettle, hoil over 
a charcoal fire for 5 minutes, take it off, add the whites of 2 



330 HONEY. 

well beaten ; when almost cold add 2 pounds more of honey. A 
decoction of slippery elm or mastic will improve the honey added 
while cooling. In hot weather it will ferment. 

GRANULATED HONEY (R. P.) The Jews of Moldarin and the 
Ukraine prepare from honey a sort of sugar, which is solid and 
white as snow, which they send to the distilleries of Dantzic. 
They expose the honey to frost for3 weeks, where neither sun nor 
snow can reach it, and in a vessel which is a bad conductor of 
coleric, by which process the honey becomes clear and hard like 
sugar. I have often seen it resemble granulated lard, and hard 
enough to cut with a knife. It may be kept in this state for years 
by keeping it a number of degrees below the freezing point in ice 
in an ice-house. It greatly improves in flavor by becoming, as we 
call it, "candied." It is granulated and beautiful returns to the 
liquid state in warm weather. The Chinese have a way to make it 
continue in this candied state, and sell it in jars as they do their pre- 
serves. In every instance the comb is removed and the honey clear. 
Though I have often seen the honey candied in the comb in very 
cold weather. It is delicious whether in or out of the comb. 

MANUFACTURED HONEY (A Cuban recipe.)--One quart of water, 
1 1 pounds brown sugar, old bee honey in the comb 2 pounds, cream 
tartar 50 grains, gum arabic i ounce, oil of peppermint 5 drops, oil 
of rose 2 drops. Mix and boil 2 or 3 minutes and remove from 
the fire. Have ready strained i quart of water, in which a table- 
spoonful of pulverized slipery elm bark has stood sufficiently long 
to make it ropy and thick like honey. Mix this into the kettle with 
an egg beaten up, stir well a few minutes, and when a little cool add 
2 pounds of nice strained bees' honey, then strain the whole, and 
you will have not only an article which looks and tastes like honey, 
but which possesses all its medical properties. The bark of the mastic 
tree could be substituted for the slippery elm. 

NOTE In preserving fruits in brandy or spirits place the fruit in 
Jaottles, then pour the spirits over them, in which 1-2 pound of sugar 
to every quart of spirits is dissolved. The spirits should be good. 

SYRUPS Allow 2 pounds of the best sugar to every pint of pure 
water, then pour the cold water on the sugar and let them remain 
for some hours, stirring occasionally; then heat very gently to finish 
the solution, after simmering i or 2 minutes ; then check it ; if 
it pours out like oil it is done, or if a thin skim appears when flow- 
ing on the syrup. 

SUGAR BOILING FOR CANDYING. Take any quantity of well 
clarified and perfectly transparent syrup and boil it to the required 
degree, which is ascertained by dipping a perforated skimmer into 
the boiling fluid and let it drain through into the kettle, then blow 



HONEY. 331 

through the holes, and if the syrup that remains forms into bladders 
it has arrived at the second degree ; then to ascertain if it has ar- 
rived at feathered degree re dip the skimmer and shake it over 
the boiler, and if it flies off like feathers it is ready. Then boil a 
while longer, then dip a stick into the syrup, and then into cold wa- 
ter ; if right, the moment it touches it, it will snap like glass, when 
it is at full candy height. At once remove from the fire and set in 
cold water to keep from burning. One drop of oil will flavor a large 
quantity, such as citron, Lergamot, &c. 

SUGAR LEMON. To every 4 pounds of the best refined white 
sugar 3 ounces of tartaric acid; 1-4 oz. essence of lemon. Used for 
lemonade, &c. 

HONEY, DOMESTIC, QUICKLY MADE. (Mrs. Curry.) For 2 coffee 
cups of white gianulated sugar add 1-2 cup of water, in which is 
melted a piece of citric acid as large as the end of the little finger, 
or less. Boil in a porcelain kettle till it begins to thicken a little ; 
when sufficiently cool pour into a jar or an earthen vessel ; keep 
covered. Excellent for waffles or any kind of griddle cakes, pan- 
cakes or fritters. 

CANDIED CHERRIES FOR THE GRANGE. 1-2 gallon of the largest 
red cherries; fully ripe, a pounds of good loaf sugar, i tumbler of 
water; put the sugar into an enameled kettle and pour the water on 
it, boil as for candy, until thick enough to pull, set it on the corner of 
the stove and stir until it shows signs of granulation. To cause this 
it should be stirred frequently while cooking. When the grains or 
crystals appear on the back of the spoon, drop in the cherries, a 
few at a time ; let each addition remain in the syrup for a few min- 
utes, then place in a sieve over a dish ; shake gently but long, then 
turn the cherries out to coo! upon a shallow broad dish, and dry in a 
sunny place. 

A GRANGER'S CANDIED LEMON PEEL. Take 15 California 
lemons, 5 Ibs. of loaf sugar, with a small portion of lemon juice, 3 1-2 
cups of clear, cold water. Remove carefully the peel from the lemon 
in long strips, and let them remain in salt and water for a niylu ; 
then wash them in four or five waters next morning, and boil until 
tender and soft. They should look clear, but not so tender as to 
break. Dissolve a large pinch of powdered alum in cold water 
enough to cover the conserve, and let it remain for 2 hours. The 
syrup now being ready, mix the sugar in 3 1-2 cups of water, add to 
it the juice of 4 lemons, and boU until it ropes from the end of the 
spoon, then add the peels to this and simmer gently for 30 minutes. 
Then take them out and spread upon a sieve set over a dish ; shake 
cautiously and frequently, tossing over the peel until almost dry. 
Sift granulated sugar over them, and lay them upon a clean cloth 



332 CANDIES. 

spread over a table in the open air. When thoroughly dried, pack 
in glass jars. 

To CANDY ANY SORT OF FRUIT. When finished in the syrup, put 
a layer of fruit into a seive and dip it suddenly into hot water, to 
take off the syrup that hangs about it; then put it on a napkin be- 
fore the fire to drain, and place some more in the seive. Have 
ready sifted double refined sugar, which, sift over the fruit on all 
sides, till quite white. Set it, in a single layer, on seives in -a lightly 
warm oven, and turn it two or three times ; it must not be allowed 
to get cold until dry ; watch it carefully, and it will have a beautiful 
appearance. When any sweetmeats are directed to be dried in the 
sun or in a stove, it will be best in private families where there is not 
a regular stove for the purpose, to put them in the sun, on flag- 
stones, which reflect the heat, or put them into an oven, taking care 
not to let it be too warm, and watch that they are done properly and 
slowly. 

To CLARIFY SUGAR FOR PRESERVING FRUITS, ETC. To every 
pound of broken sugar take 1-4 pint of water and the half of an egg, 
beat up ; stir this up until the sugar dissolves; when it boils, and 
the scum rises strong and thick, pour in another gill of water to each 
pound ; let it boil, edging the pan forward till all the scum is thrown 
off. Set it on the hearth, and when it has settled, take off the scum, 
and lay it on a reversed hair seive over a dish, that the syrup may 
run from it; return the syrup into the pan, and boil and skim it once 
more. 

CANDIES. 

HOMK-MADE CANDY. Use a new tin basin, put into it 4 table- 
spoonfuls of water, i Ib. ol coffee sugar, T teaspoonful of good cream 
of tartar; boil, stirring constantly to avoid burning. After it begins 
to have a sappy appearance, try it often by dropping a little into 
cold water, and if done, it will at once become brittle. Butter an 
earthen dish and pour the hot candy into it, that it may cool enough 
to handle. Flavor to taste with oil of peppermint, wintergreen, sas- 
safras or lemon ; two drops will flavor it strong. For variety, divide 
it into 3 or four parts and flavor differently by touching one kind of 
oil to each. Work in the hands at once ; the more it is pulled the 
whiter it will get. 

ALMOND TAFFY. Boil a syrup of i Ib. of sugar to i 1-2 pints of 
water to caramel height, throwing in an ounce of blanched almonds, 
split into strips, and i oz. of butter. When the candy hardens at 
once in the water, turn it out into a buitered slab and cut into thin 
squares. 

HOARHOUND CANDY. Good for cough and hoarseness. Gather 



CANDIES.

the herb and wash it clean, then boil till the juice is extracted ; then 
boil some sugar, till it becomes light, and add the juice of the hoar- 
hound to it, and boil it up again. Stir it with a spoon against the 
side of the pan, till white, then pour it into a paper case, horizontal- 
ly, dust it with fine sugar, and cut in squares ; or the hoarhound may 
be dried, and put into the sugar, finely powdered and sifted. 

SAN FRANCISCO KISSES. Beat 12 eggs to a froth, and slowly 
sprinkle i Ib. of fine sugar in it, while beating do not stir it; as soon 
as the sugar is in, stop beating. Have a tin tube and put it on pa- 
per about 3 inches long, and bake in a quick oven ; as soon as dry, 
press the center down, fill with thick cream, seasoned to taste, .pile it 
high in the center, and turn one piece on the other, to form an egg- 
shape. 

CHOCOLATE CREAMS. Are made by boiling 20 Ibs. of best white 
sugar to hard balls, and stirring, till it is formed into a cream, then 
make holes with your moulds in the best white powdered starch; and 
fill with the cream ; take them out of your starch, put them in a 
sieve and brush well, then dip into melted chocolate, and let them 
stand till cold. 

LITTLE MOLLY'S GRANDMAMA'S VINEGAR CANDY. Four cups 
white sugar, 2 cups clear vinegar ; after stirring the sugar and vine- 
gar until dissolved perfectly, then stew gently, till it harden a little on 
the spoon, then pour upon broad, flat dishes, well buttered, and cool. 
Then, as soon as you are able to put the tips of your fingers into it 
without burning begin to pull it, until white and porous. It is ex- 
cellent for a cough, or sore throat, or hoarseness. 

BUTTER SCOTCH CANDY. Four cups brown sugar, 2 of butter, 
vinegar to taste, 2 tablespoonfuls of water, and a little soda; boil 1-2 
hour. Drop a little in hot water; if crisp, it is done. 

MOLASSKS CANDY. (Our Own.) Two pints of molasses, i 1-2 Ibs. 
brown sugar, the juice of a large lemon, and 12 drops of oil of lemon. 
Mix the molasses and sugar together, butter the inside of your ket- 
tle, and put your ingredients in it, then boil over a moderate fire 
for 2 hours, add the lemon juice and boil for 30 minutes ; stir it 
often to prevent it from burning. When thoroughly done, it will 
cease boiling, then butter a flat dish or pan, and pour it out to cool. 
If sufficiently done, it will be crisp and brittle, if not, it will be tough 
and ropy. Nuts of any kind may be added just before it is put in 
the pan, and stirred well into the candy. Pull with the hand when 
sufficiently cool. 

MOLASSES CANDY. (Julia French.) One cup of molasses, i cup of 
sugar, 2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar, piece of butter the size of an egg, 
boil, (but do not stir), until it hardens, when dropped in cold water. 
Then stir in a teaspoonful of soda, and pour on buttered tins ; when 
cool, pull and cut in sticks. 



334 CANDIES. 

OR. Two cups sugar, 2 tablespoonfuls vinegar, boil, when done, 
add a teaspoon soda ; pour out, cool and pull, or cut in squares with- 
out pulling ; do not stir while boiling. 

MOLASSES CANDY, (French.) Two cups sugar, 2 tablespoonfuls 
vinegar, i cup of molasses, a cupful of butter, do not stir, boil till it 
hardens, then add a teaspoonful of soda, and pour in buttered tins. 
Pull and cut as desired, in any form. 

A GRANGER'S MARBLED CREAM CANDY. Six cups of fine white 
sugar, 2 teacups of water, 2 of rich, sweet cream, 2 tablespoonfuls 
(even) of butter, 2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar, 1-2 teaspoon of soda, 
stirred in cream, 4 tablespoonfuls of grated chocolate, extract of van- 
illa to taste. Reserve 1-2 of the cream, the chocolate and vanilla ; 
boil all the ingredients (besides) together very quickly, until it is 
thick and ropy; then beat in another pan, the reserved cream, into 
which you have rubbed the grated chocolale, after stewing till quite 
thick; when the candy is done, add a cupful of it to this, while stir- 
ring it thoroughly. Pour out upon broad and fiat dishes, the un- 
colored syrup, then pour upon it here and there, large spoonfuls of the 
chocolate mixture. So soon as you can bear it, pull it with the tips 
of your fingers. If skillfully managed, it will be beautifully streaked 
with white and dark color. 

TAFFY. Add the grated rind of one lemon, to i Ib. sugar (loaf) 
3 oz. of butter. Boil for 1-4 hour; pour into dishes slightly buttered. 
Cut in strips with a buttered knife, but do not attempt to raise them 
till cold. One pound of thin shelled almonds will yield 1-2 Ib. when 
shelled; very thick shelled will require more. 

To MAKE COCOA NUT CANDY. Let your cocoa nut be sweet 
and fresh, rasp it finely. Spread on a sheet over a wide platter and 
let it dry without artificial means; three days will do, to each pound 
of nuts allow 1-4 Ib. of sugar or more, if desired. Boil the sugar, 
when it begins to become very white, strew in the nut gradually, stir 
and mix it well, until finished. To prevent it from burning, keep 
the pan a little above the fire. 

CHOCLATE CARAMELS. Take i pint of new milk; 1-4 Ib. of 
chocolate, i Ib. of white sugar, boil this well together. Try this on 
a buttered plate, as it will not crisp in water, and when done pour 
on buttered pans and mark off in squares with a knife as it curls, 
and then it will easily break when cold. They are very nice. 

SILK THREAD OR SPUN SUGAR. Having boiled your sugar until 
it cracks and does not adhere to the teeth in eating it, oil the handle 
of a wooden spoon, tie two forks together, the prongs turned out- 
wards, dip them lightly into boiled sugar, take out and shake them 
to and fro, the sugar running from them over the spoon, forming 
fine silken threads, proceeding thus until you have as much as you 



CANDIES. 335 

require, take it from the spoon and form it with your hands into 
whatever may be directed for the finishing of any dish, not however, 
too thick, or it would look heavy. 

NOGAR. Take 1-2 Ib. of pounded sugar; put it in a stew pan 
over a gentle fire without water ; and when a light brown, add as 
many cut slices of dry almonds as will make it a thick paste ; turn it 
out in a mould, or on a marble slab, well oiled, and flatten with a 
rolling pin, and cut in square pieces. If the almonMs are browned a 
little in the oven, before putting in the sugar, the Nogar will be the 
better. 

PUNCH DROPS. Put 3-4 Ib. of coarsely pounded sugar in a basin; 
mix it to a stiff paste, with some rum and lemon juice. Put the 
paste in a pastile sugar water, boil it, and make the drops as 
described for strawberry drops. 

PINE APPLE DROPS. Make the drops as for strawberry drops 
mixing the sugar with pine apple instead of strawberry juice or 
puree. 

COCOANUT BALLS OR DROPS. One pound of grated sweet cocoa- 
nut dried a few hours in the sun or a very moderate oven ; one 
pound of loaf sugar, the whites of four well beaten eggs, drop on 
paper any size that you may wish, and bake. 

PINE APPLE BON BONS IN CASES. Boil and work the sugar, as 
above; substitute some chopped preserved pine apple for the orange 
flowers; and finish the bon bons in the same way. 

ORANGE FLOWER BON BONS IN CORES. Boil 3-4 Ib. of sugar, let 
it cool, and work it with the spatula until it becomes white; add i 
oz. of candied orange flowers, fill some small paper vases with the 
sugar; and put them in the hot cloth to dry. 

To CRYSTALIZE POP CORN. Put into an iron kettle, i table 
spoonful of butter, 3 table spoonfuls of water, and i teacupful of 
white sugar, boil until ready to candy, then throw in 3 ears of corn 
nicely popped, and stir briskly, until the candy is merely distributed 
over the corn, remove the kettle off the fire, and stir till cooled a 
little, and you have each grain seperate and crystalized with the 
sugar, care should be taken that the vessel be perfectly clean and 
not too hot a fire, lest you scorch the corn when crystaliz- 
ing. Walnuts, almonds, or nuts of any kind prepared in this way 
are delicious. 

POP CORN BALLS. Use none but that is fully open, then place 2 
pecks of the corn in a large dripping pan ; then in a proper sized 
kettle, put i Ib. of nice sugar dissolved with a very little water, and 
boil as you would candy, until it becomes a little stiff in cold water, 
then take it from the fire, then pour into it a gill of thick gum arabic 
water, made by melting gum arabic in boiling water, and standing all 



336 TO CAN VEGETABLES, ETC. 

night, then pour here and there a little of the mixture over the corn, 
then with the hand or a stick, stir the corn until it thoroughly incu- 
porated with the candy mixture, then the corn can be measured in a 
cup and pressed together with the hands quickly, before it gets cold 
and hard. 

CANDY FIGS. Set over a slow fire in a pan, i Ib. of sugar in i 
pint of water when done, add a few drops of vanilla, and a lump of 
butter, and put info pans into which split figs are laid. 

GINGER CANDY. Useful for flatulency and pain in the stomach. 
To i pound of finely beaten loaf sugar add i ounce of finely pow- 
dered ginger, put them both into a preserving pan with enough wa- 
ter to dissolve the sugar. Stir the whole over a slow fire till the 
sugar begins to boil, then put in another pound of finely beaten 
sugar and stir it till it becomes thick ; remove it from the fire and 
drop it upon earthen plates. Set them in a warm place to dry. 

To IMPKOVE SUGAR AND INCREASE IT. To every 5 Ibs. of sugar 
add i of flour. 

TO CAN VEGETABLES, FRUITS, ETC. 



To CAN TOMATOES AND OKRA FOR SOUP. Pour boiling water 
over ripe, sound tomatoes, then remove the skins, put into a porce- 
lain kettle to boil ; as the water rises dip part of it off, or it will re- 
quire a long time to reduce the tomatoes so as to can ; boil until 
almost ready for table use. In the meantime wash the okra, and 
cut crosswise, and drop into boiling water, boil 1-2 hour, skim sev- 
eral times, dip up with a perforated ladle and drop into the toma- 
toes, and let all boil 1-2 hour, pour into cans and seal while hot. 
Mrs. Martin. 

To CAN FRUIT (Mrs. H.) The chief agent in the work of pres- 
ervation is heat. After the application of heat after a certain length 
of time (by which process the air is expelled), the article may be 
sealed hermetrically and remain unchanged for an indefinite period. 
The fruit and vegetables should be canned as soon as possible after 
being gathered. How to know that the can is hermetrically sealed 
and that its contents will keep: the contents, as soon as they cool ; 
will shrink, leaving a vacuum, and the top and bottom of the can 
will concave from the pressure of the external air. This shows that 
the sealing is complete. Set the can in a warm place, and after 4 
or 5 days the concave condition of the top and bottom remains is all 
right. 

SMALLER FRUITS. Such as raspberries, strawberries, blackberries, 
thimbleberries, currants, &c., may also be done as follows : Pick and 
wash the fruit carefully and weigh, allowing to each pound of fruit 



TO CAN VEGETABLES, ETC. 337 

1-2 pound of sugar or less. Put the fruit and sugar in alternate 
layers in a vessel and allow them to stand i hour, then put them into 
a preserving kettle and boil 10 minutes. Can and seal at once. 

CANNED PINE APPLE. (Mrs. Bristol.) For 6 Ibs. of fruit, when 
cut and ready to can, make syrup with 2 1-2 pounds sugar and nearly 
3 pints of water, boil water 5 minutes and skim or strain, if neces- 
sary, then add the fruit, and let it boil up ; have cans hot and fill 
and close up as soon as possible. Use the best white sugar ; as the 
cans cool keep tightening them up. 

To CAN QUINCES. It is necessary that the fruit, after being pared 
and cut in slices of uniform size, should be boiled in clear water till 
slightly tender. In the water in which they were boiled (allowing a 
tumblerful to a pound of sugar), dissolved sugar in the proportion 
of 1-2 pound to a pound of fruit. As soon as the sugar is dissolved 
and the syrup begins to boil, return the quinces to the kettle and 
boil for 15 minutes. Can them while boiling hot and sealing imme- 
diately. Pears and apples may be done in the same manner. 

BOTTLED PLUMS. (Australian.) Gather the fruit when dry, put it 
into stone jars, tie it down with bladders, and over the bladder tie a 
paper to keep the bladder from drying. Put the jars to stand in a 
very cool oven, for 24 hours longer, take off the paper and look at 
the bladder, if it is not cracked, label and put away in a warm and 
dry place ; if any of the bladders be cracked, put on a new one and 
just make the plums hot through in the oven, so as to exhaust the 
air. The oven throughout this process should be very much cooler 
than even for a custard. These plums keep very well, and are more 
like fresh fruit, than when done with sugar. 

To BOTTLE PLUMS. (Mrs. E. P. Nottingham, Va.) Have your 
bottles perfectly dry, and fill them with the fruit to within 2 inches of 
the neck, stop the bottles slightly with paper, set them in a vessel of 
cold water, and let them heat gradually until the water boils 10 or 15 
minutes, then take the water off with the bottles in it, and let them 
remain, until the water is perfectly cool, then have some corks, soaked 
in boiling water, with which stop the bottles very tight, then dip the 
corked part in melted rosin or sealing wax. Make a deep hole in 
the earth in a shady, cool place or cellar, and cover them up. When 
tarts are to be made, sweeten the fruit to fancy. 

THE COLD PROCESS OF CANNING FRUIT. If peaches, pare arvl 
halve them, pack them as closely as possible in a can without ; , 
sugar ; when the can is full pour in sufficient pure cold water t< 
all the interscices between the peaches and to reach the rim <>! i.ic 
can ; let it stand long enough in the water to soak into all thu crev- 
ices, say 6 hours, then pour in water to replace what has been sunk 
away. Seal up the can, and all is done. Canned in this way ^caches

retain all their freshness and flavor. There will not be water enough 
in them to render them insipid. If preferred, a cold syrup could be 
used instead of pure water, but the peaches taste natural without any 
sweetening. 

SPICES. 

SPICES. To have them good, one must have them prepared at 
home. In ordinary cooking the following proportions are used : 
Put into a clean paper bag, of a light straw color, 1-4 oz. of bay leaf, 
1-4 oz. of thyme, 1-8 oz. of rosemary, 1-8 oz. of marjoram; put the 
bag into a hot screen until the herbs are quite dry; mix in a mortar 
with 1-2 oz. nutmeg, 1-2 oz. of cloves, 1-4 oz. of whole peppers, 1-8 
oz. of Cayenne pepper; pound the whole, and pass through a hair 
seive. Keep the mixed spices in a dry, well-corked bottle. These 
spices are used either alone or with salt added. The proportion for 
mixing with salt is i oz. of the mixture to 4 oz. of fine salt. In con- 
formity to these proportions, a good seasoning will be secured. It 
is very easy to perceive all the advantages of having such a mixture 
prepared, together with the definite instructions as to the proper 
quantity required for different seasonings. As an instance of the 
employment of the mixture in practice, I will at once mention that i 
oz. of the spiced salt just referred to, will be the quantity required to 
season 3 Ibs. of force meat. 

CONCENTRATED ESSENCE OF GINGER. Unbleached, well-bruised 
Jamaica ginger 4 oz., rectified spirits of wine i pt.; digest for two 
weeks, press and filter. 

SPICES FOR SEASONING How TO PREPARE THEM. 2 oz. each of 
cloves and white pepper grains, i oz. each of nutmeg, mace, sweet 
basil, marjoram and thyme, 1-2 oz. of bay leaves; the herbs should 
be dried in the shade, in a dry, airy place, the spices coarsely beaten, 
then place these ingredients between sheets of vellum paper, folded 
over them and tied up, so as to prevent the aroma of the ingredients 
from escaping ; then place them in a stove, with a sheet of tin to 
keep them from burning, dry gradually and perfectly, then crumble 
them at once and run them through a sifter ; put in a bottle and 
cork tightly. 

CURRIES. 

GRILLED CHICKEN WITH SHARP SAUCE. Prepare your chicken as 
for grill, oil it slightly over, season with pepper and salt, in propor- 
tion to size, then place it on a gridiron over rather a fierce fire ; 
when nearly done, put by degrees 2 tablespoonfuls of Sultana sauce 
over it, losing none of it; when done, have on a dish i oz. of butter; 
pour over the butter another tablespoonful of sauce, mix well, and 
ufter turning the chicken two or three times, serve it up. 



CURRIES. 

INDIAN CURRY POWDER. 1-4 lb. of coriander seed, 1-4 Ib. of 
tamerice, 2 oz. cinnamon seed, 1-2 oz. Cayenne, i oz. mustard, i oz. 
ground ginger, 1-2 oz. allspice, 2 qz. fenugreek seed. Put 
all the ingredients in a cool oven, where 'they should remain over 
night; then pound them in a mortar, rub them through a seive and 
mix thoroughly together. Keep the powder in a bottle, from which 
the air should be completely excluded. This receipt is given, as 
many persons prefer to make their curry powder at home, but that 
purchased, is, generally speaking, far superior, and very frequently 
more economical. 

CURRIED BEEF. A fe\v slices of tolerably lean roasted, or boil- 
ed beef, 3 ozs. of butter, 2 onions, i wineglassful of beer, i dessert 
spoonful of currypowder ; cut the beef into pieces about 3 inches 
square, put the butter in a stewpan with the sliced onions and fry 
them of a light brown color , add all the ingredients and stir gently 
over a brisk fire for about 10 minutes. Should this be thought too 
dry, more beer, or a spoonful or two of grog or water may be added, 
but a good curry should not be thin. Place in a deep dish with an 
edging of boiled rice, in the same manner for the curries. Cook 10 
minutes. Seasonable at any time. 

INDIAN MUSTARD. One quarter pound of the best mustard, 1-4 
lb. of flour, 1-2 lb of salt, 4 shalots, 4 tablespoonfuls of vinegar, 4 
tablespoonsuls of catsup 1-2 bottle of andury sauce. Put the mus-~ 
tard, flour and salt into a basin and make into a stift paste with boil- 
ing water Boil the shalots with the catsup, vinegar, and anchovy 
sauce for 10 minutes, and pour the whole (boiling) over the mixture 
in the basin. Stir well and reduce to a proper thickness, put into a 
b> ttle, with a bruised shalot at the bottom, and store away for use. 
This makes an excellent relish, and if properly prepared, will keep 
for years. 

A WET CURRY. Of whatever ingredient, cut it into small pieces ; 
put them, with 2 or 3 onions, sliced, into a stew-pan, fry them till 
brown. When done, add a tablespoonful of the curry-powder, and 
some salt and simmer the whole gently with a little water or broth, 
until sufficiently cooked. Stir constantly. 

To MAKE A CURRY OF LOBSTERS. Having taken the edible sub- 
stance from the shells, lay it in a pan, with a little mace, 3 spoonfuls 
of veal gravy, and 4 of cream, rub smooth i or 2 teaspoonfuls of 
curry-powder, i of flour, and i oz. of butter, simmer, these together 
for an hour; squeeze therein the juice of 1-2 lemon and add some 
salt. Prawns may be used instead of lobsters. Add rice, as 

usual. 

CURRIED MUTTON. The remains of any joint of cold mutton, 2 
onions, 1-4 lb. ofbutter, i dessert-spoonful of curry-powder, salt to 



340 CURRIES. 

taste, 1-4 pint of stock or water. Slice the onions in thin rings, and 
put them into a stew-pan with the butter and fry of alight brown, 
stir in the curry-powder, flour and salt, and mix all well together ; cut 
the meat in thin slices, (if there is not enough to do this, it may be 
minced) and add it to the other ingredients ; when well browned add 
the stock or gravy, and stew gently for 1-2 an hour. Serve in a dish 
with a border of boiled rice, the same as for other curries. Cook 
1-2 hour. 

CURRIED FOWL OR CHICKEN. The remains of cold roast fowls, 2 
onions, i apple, 2 ozs. of butter, i dessert-spoonful of curry-powder, 
i teaspoonful of flour, 1-2 pint of gravy, i tablespoonful of lemon 
juice. Skin the onions, peel, core, and chop the apple, and cut the 
fowl into neat joints ; fry these in the butter, of a light brown, then 
add the currypowder, flour and gravy, and stew for about 20 minutes. 
Put in the lemon juice, and serve with boiled rice, either placed in a 
ledge round the dish, or separately. 2 or 3 shalots or a little garlic 
may be added, if approved. Altogether, cook 1-2 hour. 

CURRY. Slice 6 onions, i green apple, and a clove of garlic ; 
stew them in a little good beef, mutton or fowl broth, until they will 
pulp, then add one teaspoonful of currypowder, a few tablespoonfuls 
of the broth, a little salt and a few cayenne peppers, a pinch of each. 
Stir in this gravy any kind of meat, cut into small pieces, adding a 
piece of butter, the size of a walnut, rolled in butter. 

CURRY SAUCE. This recipe is from Captain White, who resided 
for 20 years in the East Indies. Take 2 good sized apples and 4 
large onions, and 4 ozs. each of sweet butter and lean ham. Slice 
the apples and onions and put them all into a stewpan,with a blade 
of mace, 2 sprigs of thyme, 4 pepper corns, and 2 bay leaves. Stir 
over the fire, until the onions become brown and tender, then add 2 
tablespoonfuls of the best curry powder, i of vinegar, 2 of flour, a 
teaspoonful of salt, i of sugar. Moisten it with a little broth, milk, 
cream or water, with the addition of a little glaze; boil till in a mass 
and sticking to the back of the spoon, strain it and boil again for a 
few minutes ; put it in a covered jar. In the winter it will keep for 
months. A spoonful of this may be used instead of curry powder 
for currying meat, fowl, fish, game, or for rewarming it in this sauce. 
Eaten with well boiled and dry rice. This sauce should be boiled 
over now and then. 

CURRY, (Contributed by Miss Lillie B. Happer, Canton, China. 
Take one onion, some garlic, some red pepper, and chop very fine, 
put in a skillet and fry till brown, then stir in some curry powder to 
taste, and add boiling water till you think it is thin enough, then put 
in whatever meat you choose, chicken, fish or mutton, all cut up, 
add butter if you like, and boil a short time. Serve hot with rice. 



COFFEE. 



TEA CHOCOLATE. 



34 1 



LEMON IN TEA (Spanish.) Put a very thin slice of lemon on 
top of the sugar in the cup, then pour the tea over ; no cream is 
used. 

TEA How TO MAKE IT. To prevent sleep and yet not feel lan- 
guid. To weak, green tea add a little brandy, sugar and lemon 
juice. 

A NEW WAY TO MAKE TEA. Put the tea in the pot and let them 
both become hot by degrees, then pour over the boiling water and 
let it stand for 5 or 6 minutes in a hot place. 

NOTE The leaves and pot should heat for 10 or 15 minutes. 

THE English make the best tea. 

GOOD black tea is generally admitted to be the most beneficial 
and the least prejudicial, but most persons prefer it with a mixture 
of the green in equal parts.- Green alone is certainly injurious. 

CHOCOLATE--HOW TO MAKE. One-half pound of ground choco- 
late, a little each of cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla, 3 cups of water. 
4 cups of milk ; first boil the grated chocolate, the spices and water 
together, then add the milk, stirring well all the time, then set it on 
the fire or hot ashes to boil for 3-4 of an hour ; sweeten to taste. If 
sweet or spiced chocolate be used, use but little sugar or spice. 

CHOCOLATE MILK. Dissolve i large spoonful of chocolate in 2 1-2 
cups of milk, new and sweet. 

CHOCOLATE should not be made until the moment it is wanted, 
because heating injures the flavor, destroys the froth and separates 
the body of the chocolate, the oil rising to the top after a short boil- 
ing, or remaining long by the fire, which is the principal, if not the 
only cause why chocolate disagrees with delicate stomachs. Ifrightly 
prepared it is both nutritive and wholesome. 

COFFEE. 

SPANISH OR ST. DOMINGO WAV TO MAKE COFFEE. Put the de- 
sired quantity of coffee in a flannel bag, and then pour over boiling 
water, but do not let it come to a boil, but shake the pot of boiling 
fluid well, pouring it back and forth, then pour out and serve in small 
cups without cream or sugar ; it is delightful. This is the way the 
Spanish residents make coffee on Island of St. Domingo. 

NOTE The coffee is always beaten in a mortar, which causes it 
to retain the greater portion of its aroma. A hundred cups of coffee 
can be made in this way at once, and can be kept hot without boil- 
ing. 



342 COFFEE. 

COFFEE How TO MAKE IT. Put 2 ounces of ground or beaten 
coffee into a stew pan, then set it upon the fire, and with an iron 
spoon stir the powder well till quite hot, then pour over it 2 cups of 
boiling water, then put the cover on for 5 minutes ; strain it through 
a cloth and put in a pot, and rewarm it and serve. 

COFFEE, TO MAKE IN THE OLD STYLE. One teacupful of ground 
coffee, moisten with the white of an egg and cold water stirred well 
together, pour on boiling water, set it on the stove and let it boil 
up 3 times, stir it down twice with a spoon, but the third time pour 
in 1-2 cup of cold water, let stand 2 or 3 minutes and serve boiling 
hot. It is elegant. 

COFFEE A NEW WAY TO MAKE WHEN IN A HURRY. Put 2 table- 
spoonfuls of coffee into a sauce pan, then put it on the fire, then stir 
it with an iron spoon until it becomes quite hot, then pour over it a 
pint of boiling water, then put the top on and boil for 4 or 5 minutes, 
then strain and re-warm it and serve. Sugar and cream or milk can 
be added to taste. 

To AVOID COFFEF, LOSING ITS STRENGTH When the roasting is 
completed, while hot, put 1-2 ounce of white or brown sugar to i Ib. 
of coffee ; the sugar melts immediately ; by well shaking or turning 
the roaster quickly it spreads all over the berries and gives each one 
a fine glaze. It then has a shining appearance as if covered 
with varnish, and has no smell, which returns when ground in a high 
degree. When roasted the grains should be opened, if heaped to- 
gether it causes them to sweat and lose their strength. 

ARABIAN MANNER OF SETTLING COFFEE. Dip a cloth in cold wa- 
ter and wrap it around the hot coffee pot, and it will clear rapidly. 

To PRESERVE GROUND COFFEE. Wet ground coffee i Ib. with 3 
oz. of sugar, or thoroughly in cold water, then spread it oul in the 
open air to dry. The sugar locks up all the volatile parts, so that 
when it dries, it does not escape. It will keep a month in this way 
if exposed to the air. 

How TO MAKE IT, THUS PRESERVED. Pour cold water over the 
powder, and boil it. It makes as good a beverage, as if just roasted. 

TO MAKE COFFKE AS USED BY BONAPARTE. Put the ground Cof- 

fee into a vessel with a strainer, and pour the water on it perfect- 
ly cold, plunge this vesel into another, filled with boiling water, which 
must be kept at the boiling point until the process is completed. 
This method is thought to preserve the flavor of the coffee perfectly. 
To ROAST COFFEE. (A French recipe.) It is acknowledged that 
the French coffee is decidedly superior to any other, and as the 
roasting of the berry is of great importance to the flavor of the pre- 
paration, it will be useful and interesting to know how they manage 
these things in France. In Paris there are two houses, justly cele- 



BREAKFAST, LUNCH AND TEA. 343 

brated for the flavor of their coffee. La Maison Circdett and La 
Maison Soger de Chartres, and to obtain this flavor before roast- 
ing they add to every 3 Ibs, of coffee a piece of butter the size of a 
nut, and a dessert spoonful of powdered sugar ; it is then roasted 
in the usual manner. The addition of the butter and sugar devel- 
ope the flavor and aroma of the berry : it must be borne in mind, 
that the quality of the butter must be of the very best description. 

COFFEE, TURKISH FASHION. When the water has just come to 
boil, add the coffee and sugar ; mix well, as above, and give just a 
boil and serve. The grounds of coffee will in a few seconds fall to 
the bottom of the cups. The Turks wisely leave it there; and I would 
advise every one to do the same. 

CAFE AH LAIT. This is merely very strong coffee, added to a large 
proportion of good hot milk, about 6 tablespoonfuls of strong coffee 
being quite sufficient for a breakfast-cupful of milk. Of the essence 
which answers admirably for Cafe au Lait, so much would not be 
required. This preparation is infinitely superior to the weak, watery 
coffee so often served at tables. A little cream, mixed with the 
milk, if the latter cannot be depended on for richness, improves the 
taste of the coffee, so also the richness of the beverage. Six table- 
spoonfuls of strong coffee, or 2 tablespoonfuls of the essence, to a 
breakfast-cupful of milk. 

THE ORDINARY ENGLISH METHOD. The coffee and water are 
put into the pot at the same time, and boiled for 10 minutes ; a cup- 
ful is then turned off and returned to the pot, and allowed to stand 
5 minutes, when it will, or ought to become clear. 

BREAKFAST, LUNCH AND TEA. 

CAROLINA ROLLS D. C. Take 1-2 pint of yeast, i quart of 
water, warm sweet milk and flour enough to make a light sponge; 
next morning add 1-2 pint of cold water and 1-2 Ib. of butter ; 
stir it well and add flour enough to make it tolerably stiff, let it stand 
i hour and bake in a hot oven after making it into small cakes. 

BREAKFAST ROLLS Stella. Two quarts of flour, i tablespoon- 
ful even ot sugar and butter, 1-2 cup of yeast, i pint of scalded

light, then knead until hard, and set to rise, and when wanted make 
into rolls, then oil each roll with sweet butter or lard and and set 
them rather upright and close together in the oven, and in the cen- 
tre place 3 long rolls ; set to rise and bake in a slow oven. 

YEAST ROLLS. For this kind of roll take the same dough as for 
steam nudels ; it is best to fill them with boiled fruit. After the 
dough has risen roll it as thin as possible, then the fruit spread

upon it, rolled up, put into a buttered pan and placed in a warm 
spot to rise. Some melted butter is again spread over it, then 
bake it slowly in an oven until of a light brown color, the yeast 
rolls can be sent to the table warm or cold. 

GOLDEN GATE ROLLS. One pound of flour and i pound of but- 
ter worked together with egg, i gill of yeast and as much luke- 
warm water as will make a soft dough ; cover it with flour and 
put it to rise until light ; flour your board and make into small 
rolls and bake in a quick oven. These are very nice for tea with 
invited company. 

DIXIE CORN CAKE. (Mrs. Miller, Santa Clara, Cal.) One coffee 
cupful of grits (fine hominy) boiled soft, an equal quantity of 
white corn meal stirred into the grits while hot, when sufficiently 
cool stir in briskly 5 well beaten eggs, 1-2 cup of sweet milk and 4 
tablespoonfuls of melted butter ; salt to taste ; bake in a deep but- 
tered dish or pan. 

CORN BATTER CAKES. 4 cups of boiling water or boiling milk 
mixed with 2 cups of meal ; when warm work in 4 tablespoonfuls of 
flour, 3 eggs and i teaspoonful of salt. Bake on a griddle. 

SAMP OR HOMINY CAKES. Take i pint of small hominy that 
is cooked soft, mix with i pint of wheat flour, i teaspoonful of salt 
and a little milk mixed with or without eggs ; fry them on a griddle 
and eat as buckwheat cakes. 

BUCKWHEAT CAKES (Mrs. B.) i pint warmed milk, into which 
stir in a tearup of buckwheat flour, 2 tablespoons of yeast, some 
salt, 2 well beaten eggs ; let rise, and when light, bake. Or you 
may take 2 cups of wheat flour and 2 tablespoonfuls of white 
corn meal, and mix with tepid water until it is a thick batter; add 
a tablespoonful of yeast and set it to rise an hour, pour in a 
little milk until of the consistency of waffle batter and let it stand 
2 hours in a warm place. Do not grease the griddle but once ; 
serve with melted butter in a boat. 

BUCKWHEAT CAKES. Newfield, N. Y., recipe (Mrs. L. M. Kel- 
logg-) Fi rst m ' x the flour and water with a little white corn meal, 
a little yeast, hard (leaven) or soft to raise it, set it all night in a 
moderately warm place next morning, thin it to suit with butter 
or sour milk, adding some salt. Grease your griddle well while 
hot with salt pork or the cakes will stick to it ; put on your bat- 
ter and fry. Serve very hot" with butter or molasses at table. 
The authoress has often eaten Mrs. Kellog's superior buckwheat 
cakes, and trusts that enterprising farmers will introduce the supe- 
rior buckwheat and let it form one of the staples of the whole 
Union. 

MY AUNT'S GRIDDLE CAKES. Two cupfuls of sour milk, 1-2 cup- 



BREAKFAST, LUNCH AND TEA. 345 

ful of molasses or 2 spoonfuls of brown sugar, a teaspoonful of soda, 
a heaping cupful of flour and Indian meal to make a stiff batter. 
Add a little salt and fry on a well greased clean griddle. 

FILLED MILK ROLLS. Rub off the crust of 4 milk rolls on a grater, 
make incisions about the width of a finger apart into -each, nearly 
through, take care not to cut entirely through. Fill these incisions with 
the following ingredients: Almonds shelled cut lengthwise; well picked 
and washed currants and raisins in equal quantities, 2 tablespoon- 
fuls of citron cut into little dice, a teaspoonful of grated lemon peel, 
the same of ground cinnamon and 3 tablespoonfuls ot fine sugar, 
all of which is to be well mixed. Now after the incisions are filled 
tie them around with a piece of twine and let them soak in eight 
whole eggs, which have been beaten up well with the 3 pints of cold 
milk and a little salt, then put them into a colander to drain off. 
Fry them on all sides to a nice gold yellow color. Let them stand 
for a few minutes upon blotting paper, then take off the twine, 
turn them in sugar, dish them with some appropriate sauce and 
serve. 

ROLLS, GRAHAM, FOR BREAKFAST. Rub through a colander 2 Ibs. 
of soft boiled Irish potatoes, then add 2 cups of water, 1-2 cup of 
sugar, a heaped teaspoonful of salt, 1-2 cupful of hop yeast, then 
stir it with Graham flour, making a stiff dough. Set it to rise over 
night ; in the morning make it into small cakes. Set to rise, and 
when light, bake. Graham flour should never be sifted. 

MUTTON CHOPS. Mrs. T. B. L. Trim the chops, beat them well, 
chop to mincemeat, taking care not to separate the meat from 
the bone, chop both sides and sprinkle with pepper and salt. Have 
ready some bread crumbs and 2 well beaten eggs, dip the chops 
first into the eggs, then into the crumbs, put into the frying pan 2 
ounces of butter; when it browns put in the chops, fry slowly and 
never turn them till they look firm and the gravy comes up. Turn 
them and brown them on the other side, which takes from 5 to 10 
minutes. When they feel solid they are done. Brown sauce fla- 
vored with chopped onion and parsley, a dessert spoonful of flour 
browned stirred in an ounce of butter 

ARTIFICIAL OYSTERS. Grate green corn in a dish; to 2 cups of 
this add i egg well beaten, a small teacup of flour, i teacup of but- 
ter or less, some salt and pepper; mix them well together. A table- 
spoonful of the batter will make the size of the oyster. Fry them a 
light brown, and when done butter them ; cream is better than 
butter. 

MUSHROOMS TO COOK. i cupful of water; cook 11-2 hours ; 2 
tablespoonfuls of butter, salt and pepper to taste. Stir with a silver 
spoon in a porcelain kettle. 



346 BREAKFAST, LUNCH AND TEA. 

RELISH FOR BREAKFAST OR LUNCH. Take 1-4 pound of good 
fresh cheese, cut it up into thin slices and put it in a spider, turning 
over it a large cupful of sweet milk; add a large pinch of dry mus- 
tard, a dash of pepper, a little salt and a piece of butter as large as 
a guinea's egg ; stir the mixture all the time ; powder or roll 3 soda 
crackers, sprinkle them in gradually ; as soon as they are stirred in 
turn the contents into a warm dish and serve. 

A NICE BREAKFAST DISH. Take some stale bread, cut in slices, 
make a batter of eggs, little sugar, 1-2 cup of milk, a pinch of cin- 
namon ; dip the bread well in the batter, then fry in a pan with 
plenty of butter. When well done strew over with fine sugar. 

GREEN TOMATOES FRIED. Wash and slice tomatoes very thin 
and drop them in the coldest water you have, let remain i hour, 
then salt and pepper them, drop in pancake batter and fry in boil- 
ing lard of a nice brown. Serve hot. 

ROAST BEEF WITH YORKSHIRE PUDDING. Rub salt and 
pepper over the beef, put it in a dripping-pan, cover the bot- 
tom with water, with the drippings bas.te the meat often and turn 
the meat and baste as before ; 3-4 hour before it is done take out 
the meat and pour off most of the dripping, and put in the butter 
and the meat and finish roasting ; add some hot water to the drip- 
ping and thicken with flour the gravy. 

To BOIL A STUFFED TURKEY. Take a young turkey weighing 7 
or 8 pounds, with bread, butter, salt, pepper and mixed parsley ; 
skewer up the legs and wings as if to roast, flour a cloth and pin 
around it ; boil 4 minutes, then set off the kettle and let it stand 
close covered 1-2 hour or more. The steam will cook it sufficiently. 
To be eaten with drawn butter and stewed oysters. 

MILK OR CREAM GRAVY FOR BAKED POTATOES. i quart of milk, 
3 tablespoonfuls of corn starch made into a smooth batter with rich 
milk or cream. Boil the milk and pour in the batter, stirring all the 
while. Let it boil 2 or 3 minutes, remove from the fire and stir in 
immediately a well beaten egg. Very nice ; excellent for lunch or 
breakfast. 

IRISH STEW. Put into a proper sized stew pan 2 1-4 Ibs. of neck 
of mutton or lamb, or any part, cut into small pieces with some of 
the fat pieces cut small, put in a dessertspoonful of salt, a good pinch

water; boil, and then simmer for 30 minutes, then add 6 medium - 
sized Irish potatoes, which cut in 2 or 4 pieces, stir well, then boil 
for a full hour very gently. You can skim off the grease, but the 
potatoes will absorb that. It is an appetizing dish. Try it.

lay the sausages upon the top, put a little hot vinegar to the gravy 
in the pan and pour over it ; or mashed potatoes, stewed pumpkin, 
or boiled hominy may do in the place of spinach. For dinner and 
breakfast. 

WAFFLES Mrs. R. To i quart of flour add an egg and a spoon- 
ful of yeast, make these to a thin batter with milk, then put in 2 ozs. 
of butter and set to rise. It is better to make the batter early in 
the morning or over night. 

WAFFLE SAUCE Scald 2 cups of new milk or sweet cream, and 
while taking from the fire stir 2 teaspoonfuls of butter, a teaspoon- 
ful of salt into it. When melted serve up with the waffles, 

WAFFLES Mrs. R. S. Robinson, San Fransisco, Cal. Beat well 
the whites and yolks of 2 or 3 eggs separately, then have ready some 
sour milk that has been turned on the stove or near the fire, then 
stir to it a very little soda, a little salt, the yolks of the eggs, then 
stir in flour enough to make a moderately stiff batter. Have your 
irons clean, well greased and hot, pour in the batter ; as you take 
the waffles out butter them well and keep hot in the stove until 
served. 

NOTE The whites beaten to a solid foam should be added a por- 
tion at a time and stirred in the batter as you make the waffles. If 
you have but little milk, mix water with it, or use water altogether. 
Bacon grease is better than lard to fry waffles with. 

AMERICAN RAISED WAFFLES. One pint of sweet milk, i heaping 
teaspoonful of thick brewer's yeast, i quart of flour, another tea- 
spoonful of sweet milk, in which dissolve 1-4 teaspoonful of soda. 
Let it rise until light, then bake as other waffles. Serve with butter 
and sugar. 

BUCKWHEAT CAKES. Put into 1-2 gallon pitcher 3 cups of luke- 
warm water, to this add 1-2 cupful of baker's yeast with a little salt, 
then stir in enough fresh buckwheat to make a thick batter ; cover 
the pitcher after beating the batter thoroughly, and set it to rise over 
night. Next morning stir in 3 tablespoonfuls of molasses, then dis- 
solve 1-4 teaspoonful of soda in 3 tablespoonfuls of milk. Beat the 
whole well together and pour the batter from the pitcher upon a well 
greased and heated griddle. 

CREAM COOKIES, Take 1-2 pint of cream, i pound of sugar and 
i egg, beat them together, then add 1-2 cupful of sour milk, 1-2 
teaspoonful of soda, and flour enough to roll; roll out thin, cut them 
out with a cake-cutter, moisten them on the top with a little cold 
water, sift over them a little white granulated sugar in which has 
been grated some nutmeg. Bake in a quick oven. 



348 BREAKFAST, LUNCH AND TEA. 

A CREOLE LADY'S BRF.AKFAST. (Excellent for digestion.) A fig 
with a cup of coffee. 

FJ. BATING ISLAM i >s. (A colonial recipe.) Six eggs, whites and 
yolks beaten separately, add to the yolks i 1-2 pints or more of rich 
new milk, a cup of loaf sugar, nutmeg or lemon to taste; heat al- 
most to a boiling point, or until it thickens, dish and spread the 
whites of eggs, beaten to a solid froth, over; and serve hot or cold. 

APPLES IN BATTER. Take several medium sized apples, pare and 
core them, place them in a dish, make a rich batter and pour over 
them. Bake for one hour ; serve with wine sauce. 

COCOANUT BISCUITS. Add the same weight of sugar of 4 grated 
cocoanuts, together with enough whites of eggs to form a softish but 
thick paste, beat with a w toden spoon till smooth, then lay the mix- 
ture upon wafer paper in small drops or biscuits and bake in a slow 
oven. 

BEATEN BISCUITS. (Mrs. E. A. Watson.) Two quarts of flour, 2 
heaping tablespoonfuls of sweet, pure lard ; mix with cold water, till 
the dough is very stiff. Beat the dough till it blisters. 

BEATEN BISCUITS, (Another way.) Three and a halfpints of flour 
2 tablespoonfuls of lard, 1-2 pint of milk, 1-2 pint of hot water, i 
teaspoonful of salt, the yolk of an egg ; keep out one pint of flour, 
and when the other is mixed up into a stiff dough, then, as you beat 
the dough, sprinkle in the dry flour. Beat hard with the broad end 
of an ax, a rolling pin, or mallet for 1-2 hour, or until the dough be- 
comes white and smooth. 

WALA WALA BISCUITS FOR BREAKFAST. (A Housekeeper.) Make 
a batter of milk and flour, the richer the milk the better, cream pre- 
ferable, but water will do, keep it warm until it rises, make your 
dough up entirely with this, pouring it upon the flour, add salt, sal- 
eratus or soda in the yeast, according to the sourness of the yeast and 
the quantity of the flour, which should not be added too fast ; work 
the dough thoroughly, add some butter or lard, make your biscuits 
out and bake in a well greased skillet or oven. To raise the biscuit, 
someplace them for 1-2 an hour over the top of a teakettle, which 
causes them to rise better, before baking. Should be buttered and 
eaten while hot, or they are not so good. W. T. 

APPLE CHARLOTTE. This excellent and healthy dish is seldom 
seen, but it has only to be tried once to learn its excellence. The 
recipe is very simple. Put in a tolerably small bread pan a piece of 
butter the size of a walnut, and set it where it will melt, then pare, 
quarter and core a few apples, halve the quarters, if they are large, 
make them into thirds ; now place in the buttered pan as many 
slices or pieces of bread as will cover the bottom, then a la^fer of ap- 
ples, a little sugar, and 4 or 5 little chips of butter ; another layer of 



BREAKFAST, LUNCH AND TEA. 349 

bread, another layer of apples, and so on until it is enough for dinner, 
or until the pan is full; butter the upper layer of bread. Bake in a 
slow oven. If the oven is too hot and browns the top too fast before 
the center bakes, with a spoon drip a little hot water over it. Serve 
hot, with or without sauce. 

CHARLOTTE RUSSE. (Mrs. Barringer.) One pint of milk, 12 eggs, 
1-2 pound of sugar, i pint of rich cream, and i pint of jelly. Make 
a custard of the milk, eggs, sugar, and flavor with lemon or vanilla. 
Dissolve the jelly, and add it to the custard, and stir the whole till it 
is cold, and about as thick as the thickest molasses, then beat in the 
cream, which has been previously whipped, and pour into moulds 
lined with sponge cake. If the weather is warm, set it on the ice, 
and let it remain for nearly an hour and turn out in a china dish. 
Ice the whole with icing prepared as for cake, and when it is dry, 
put some icing in a paper horn and run over it in a fanciful form; 
set in a refrigerator until wanted. Omit the icing if you choose. In- 
stead of a mould, you may take a large, round sponge cake, turn it 
bottom upwards, and cut off a slice an inch thick, then remove the 
whole of the inside, leaving a shell an inch thick. Pour the mixture 
in this, put on the bottom slice and set on ice. 

To CURRY EGGS. (Mrs. Medhurst of Calcutta.) 12 eggs, i gill of 
sweet cream or new milk. 2 cups of broth (chicken or any kind of 
meat broth), a tablespoonful of curry powder, and enough arrow root 
or corn starch to thicken, (or rice flour). Then slice a large onion 
and fry it brown in butter; then stir in the curry powder and broth, 
till well mixed, set on the fire and simmer slowly till the onions are 
soft and tender, then stir together the arrow-root, corn starch or rice 
flour, till a smooth paste is formed, and stir this in the cream and let 
it boil slowly for a few minutes, then have your eggs boiled hard and 
cut into 2 or 4 pieces ; then heat them in the curry mixture thorough- 
ly, but by no means let them come to boiling heat, then place them 
on a hot dish, with the cut sides downwards, in a neat manner, then 
pour the sauce over them. Cook 25 minutes. Delicious. 

WAFERS, MY AUNT'S WAY TO MAKE THEM, Mix 4 oz. of melted, 
fresh and sweet butter with a cupful of flour. 

WINE WAFERS. (Mrs. N.) One pound of flour, 1-4 Ib. of butter,

Bake in wafer irons, a light brown, and roll up as a scroll while hot. 

MACAROONS. One-half pound of blanched and pounded almonds, 
the white of i egg, spoonful of orange flower water and 12 ozs. 
sugar; pound these together till the sugar is dissolved, and then

led in ; drop on buttered paper, bake on tins in a quick oven for 
1-4 hour till of a full brown color.

SWEET POTATO BUNS. Boil sweet potatoes soft, peel and mash 
them while hot in flour like bread, add spice and sugar with yeast ; 
when well risen work in butter and make the dough up in small rolls 
and bake. You can use any quantity, according to judgment. One 
quart of flour, i coffeecup of potatoes, i tablespoonful of sugar and 
6 grains of allspice with a dessertspoonful of butter is a good rule 
for a small family. 

BUNS MADE BY OUR MOTHER. Flour, 2 1-2 Ibs. ; butter, 6ozs. ; 
sugar, 1-2 Ib. ; a little salt, pulverized ginger, cinnamon and cara- 
way; 1-2 cup of yeast and sufficient warm milk to form a paste, 
then brush them over with warm milk and bake them a fine brown 
in a tolerably slow oven.

a lump of butter the size of an egg into a part of it, beat 3 or 4 
eggs very light and add them to the milk and melted butter, beat- 
ing in enough flour to make a tolerably stiff batter very hard and add 
i tablespoonful of brewer's yeast or a teacupful of homemade yeast ; 
set the dough to rise 4 hours before using.

mix all together and beat well, then stir in a large spoonful each of 
salt, yeast and sweet butter, over night. The next morning bake

COCOA, How TO MAKE. It is better to buy the beans in a small 
quantity, then roast and grind or pound them in a mortor as you 
would coffee, make as chocolate, allowing 2 heaped tablespoonfuls 
to 2 or more cups of boiling water. Boil i 1-2 hours, then stir 
in 4 cups of fresh sweet milk ; let it come to a boil, pour out and 
serve very hot. 

COFFEE AND TEAPOTS. While the coffee is boiling and the tea 
steeping the spouts of both the coffee and teapots should be stopped 
with a cork or a plug of paper to prevent the strength from escap- 
ing. I have seen a cork confined with a piece of twine to the han- 
dle, to be always ready for use. 

SUMMER SNOW (beautiful.) In a coffeecup of cold water soak 
the proper quantity of the best gelatine, 2 cups of powdered sugar ; 
juice and peel of i lemon, 1-2 ordinary sized pineapple chopped 
into small pieces, i pint of boiling water, i gill best brandy, 2 gills 
best sherry or white wine, a pinch of nutmeg, the whites of 5 eggs 
whipped to a solid froth ; mix all the ingredients into the soaked gel- 
atine, and let them remain for 2 hours ; wheri you have bruised the 
fruit well with a spoon or in wooden mortar and mixed all thoroughly, 
at the end of the time pour over the compound the 2 cups of boil- 
ing water, and continue to stir until the gelatine is thoroughly dis- 
solved. Strain through a strong flannel or net bag, squeezing and 
pressing hard. When nearly cold put in the wine and brandy, and 
cover till cold. Then by degrees whip it into the beaten whites ; no 
matter in what way beaten, if it be continued for thirty minutes or 
more. Wet the mould with cold water, then pour in the snow mix- 
ture and bury it in ice to "jeal." A dish as delicious as refreshing. 



352 BREAKFAST, LUNCH AND TEA. 

N. B. A few peach kernels blanched in boiling water to remove 
the skin, broken and boiled with any kind of jelly, marmalade, sauce, 
pudding, preserves; any kind of fruit, and even cake will improve 
the flavor. 

WHITE HONEY CAKES. Stir until frothy 1-4 pound of sugar, the 
yolks of 15 eggs and a whole egg ; mix with it 1-2 ounce of citron, 
the same of orange peel; cut into small dice; 1-2 ounce of cinna-

a lemon, 1-2 pound of peeled almonds cut into small dice; finally 
add to the mass the whites of 15 eggs beaten to stiff froth and 1-4 
pound of sifted flour ; spread it smoothly as thick as your finger 
over oblong wafers as long and as wide as your hand. Ornament 
them on the top with small pieces of lemon peel the thickness of 
the back of a knife, put them on a baking plate and bake them in 
an oven that has been allowed to cool. Bake slowly till of a bright 
yellow.

hot, stir it well and bake immediately in a quick oven. This is equally 
nice made with sour milk. 

FRIED BREAD M. A. T. Take a tablespoonful of sweet, light 
dough, dissolve in a cup of sweet milk, add 3 or 4 eggs, i 1-2 cups 
flour, i teaspoonful salt ; cut some thin slices of light bread, dip this 
in the batter and fry in hot lard ; sprinkle with powdered sugar and 
garnish with jelly. 

CAROLINA BREAD. Dip slices of light bread into new milk, then 
dip them into 2 well beaten eggs, and fry them in hot lard ; dish 
them and pour over them any kind of syrup and serve hot. 

SNOW CAKES. Put corn meal into a good sized wood or earthen 
bowl with sugar and salt to taste, then add 3 times its bulk of snow, 
and stir it together with a spoon ; when well mixed it looks like so 
much dry meal or snow. Fry a little on a hot griddle ; if it cooks 
too dry to turn well, add more snow; if too wet to be light, add 
more meal ; when just right, fry on the griddle in convenient-sized 
cakes, and they will be as light as corn bread. 

CORN CAKES. Sweet milk, i or 2 eggs, salt, about 1-3 of flour to 

2 of fresh, sweet corn meal, a little lard, no yeast powder; fry quickly 
on a hot griddle.

a little millet is added in order to give the paste greater cohesion 
and delicacy.

and grease and fill them with batter, and bake on bright coals, turn- 
ing the irons so that both sides may be browned. Butter as you take 
them from the irons.

whites of 2 beat well, i 1-2 cups of sugar, 2-3 of a cup of water, 
butter the size of an egg, 2 cups flour. This will be enough to fill 

4 large jelly moulds. 

COCOANUT BALLS. Remove from the kernels the brown skin, then 
grate with a coarse grater ; add equal weight of sifted sugar, and the 
white of one well beaten egg. Make into balls about the size of a 



$54 BREAKFAST, LUNCH AND TBA 

walnut and bake upon a tin in a moderate oven, of a light brown* 
Place the balls upon thin white paper. Remove as soon as taken 
from the oven. 

SMALL DROP CAKES. Made of this mixture by dropping a spoon- 
ful on wafer paper ; baked in a quick oven. 

GREEN CORN GRIDDLE CAKES. Make a batter of 3 or 4 eggs, 2 
cups of flour, a little salt and water, milk or meat broth, (boiled with-

thick mush of white corn meal and water, add some salt and a little 
butter, and drop in small cakes, 1-2 inch thick, on a hot griddle ; 
butter well and serve. 

FRYING GRIDDLE CAKES. Before applying your batter, rub the 
griddle with dry salt, then rubbing off carefully before oiling, which 
will cause them to turn easily. Corn, griddle and buckwheat cakes 
are nicely turned when thus treated. 

TEA CAKES. (Mrs. Jos. Mayo, Richmond, Va.) Two Ibs. of flour. 
1-2 Ib. sweet butter, yolks of 3 eggs, a teaspoonful of saleratus, dis- 
solved in a teacup of water and a dessert spoonful of vinegar. Flavor

clean feather, or soft rag, dipped in a solution of sugar and water, 
quite thick. 

BAKED APPLE DUMPLINGS. (A plain family dish.) Six apples, 3-4 
Ib. of suet crust, (see recipe) sugar to taste. Pare and take out the 
cores of the apples, dividing them, and make 1-2 Ib, of suet crust, 
(by recipe), roll the apples in the crust, previously sweetening them 
with moist sugar, and taking care to join the crust nicely ; when they 
are formed into round balls, put them on a tin and bake them for 1-2 
an hour or longer. Should the apples be very large, arrange them 
pyramidically on a dish, and sift over them some powdered sugar. 
These may be made richer, by using one of thepuft pastes instead of 
suet. Bake from 1-2 to 3-4 of an hour. Sufficient for 4 persons. 

SWEET DUMPLINGS WITH ALMONDS. Pound very fine, a oz. of 



BREAKFAST, LUNCH AND TEA. 355 

peeled sweet almonds, put them in a dish with 2 tablespoonfuls of 
flour, fine sugar and cinnamon, stir this with 3 eggs for 1-2 hour, put 
them into sweet sauce, or into wine sauce. 

LEMON DUMPLINGS. One half a pound of grated bread, i -4 Ib- 
of chopped suet, 1-4 Ib. of moist sugar; mix well together, adding 
lemon peel, which should be very finely minced. Moisten the eggs 
well with strained lemon juice. Stir well. 

SHELLS. Take 2 tablespoonfuls each of sweet milk and white 
sugar, i of melted butter, 2 eggs ; stir all together till perfectly smooth, 
then add flour till stiff enough to roll, cut the size of a walnut, roll 
very thin and round on a floured board, and cook in boiling lard, 
or oil, holding them in with a fork till done. 

CORN MUFFINS. Four cups of sifted meal, a lage spoonful of but- 
ter, 4 cups of sweet milk, a large pinch of salt, 2 tablespoonfuls of 
of yeast, and one of sugar or molasses. Bake i hour in shallow pans 
in rings, after rising 4 or 5 hours. 

MUFFINS, CINNAMON. One teacup sour milk, nearly 1-2 cup of 
sugar, i egg, i tablespoonful cinnamon, make thick with flour and 
stir till smooth. Bake in gem pans. 

ORANGE FOR DESSERT. May be put in fruit dish stands or baskets, 
or the skin may be slit into eighths, half way down, then with the 
bowl of a teaspoon tnrn the peel either outward or inwards so that 
that the peel can turn either way, showing the yellow and white 
halves of the orange. The blossom end of the fruit a little piece 
should be cut off, or you can, with a sharp knife, run around the fruit 
about half from either end, only cutting through the rind; then with 
the smooth handle of a teaspoon, slip between the rind and the fruit, 
work it carefully until the halves are free, except at the ends. Turn 
the rind without tearing it inside out, making a cap at the end, the 
fleecy white fruit between them. This is done by the master of 
ceremonies in families who live in the Orient at the conclusion of 
dinner. The effect of serving oranges in this way is beautiful and I 
have often admired the ease, and great skill with which it is done. 

PUMPKIN PIE (ENGLISH.) Take out the seeds and grate the 
pumpkin till you come to the outer skin ; sweeten the pulp, add a 
little ground allspice, lemon peel and lemon juice ; in short, flavor it 
to the taste. Bake it without an upper crust.

out the stones, add sugar and powdered cinnamon to taste, stir in 
well and bake between two crusts in a slow oven. 

LEMON PIE. i lemon, i cup of sugar, i egg, i teaspoonful of 
corn starch, 3 teaspoonfuls of cream, half cup of boiling water. Bake

356 BREAKFAST, LUNCH AND TEA. 

meat, i pound of currants, half pound of sugar, 2 ozs. of candied 
lemon peel, i oz. of citron, mixed spice to taste. Pare the lemons, 
squeeze them, and boil the peel until tender enough to mash, add to 
the mashed lemon peel the apples, which should be pared, cored and 
minced, the chopped suet, currants, sugar, sliced peel, and spices. 
Strain the lemon juice to these ingredients ; stir the mixture well, 
and put it into a jar with a close fitting lid, stir occasionally, and in 
a week or 10 days the minced meat will be ready for use. Suffi- 
cient for 1 8 larger or 24 small pies. Seasonable in cold weather. 

POLISH TARTLETS. Puff paste, the white of an egg, powdered 
sugar: roll some puff paste out thin and cut it into 21-2 inch squares; 
brush each square over with the white of an egg, then fold down the 
corners, so that they will meet in the middle of each piece of paste, 
slightly press the two pieces together, brush them over with the egg, 
sift over some sugar, and bake in a nice quick oven for 1-4 hour. 
When they are done, make a little hole in the middle of the paste, 
and fill it up with apricot jam, marmalade or red currant jelly. Pile 
them high in the center of a dish, on a napkin, and garnish with the 
same preserve that the tartlets are filled with. Bake 15 to 20 min- 
utes. Sufficient for 2 dishes of pastry. Seasonable at any time, 
N. B. It should be borne in mind, that, for all dishes of small pastry, 
such as the preceding, trimmings of puff paste, left from larger tarts, 
answer as well as making the paste expressly. 

CORN PATTIES. (Mrs. S. M. Kellogg.) Grate i dozen ears of 
green Corn, add to it 2 well beaten eggs, withatablespoonful of flour, 
a little salt and pepper, beat well and drop in a hot griddle or pan,

cup sweet milk, 2 eggs, i teaspoonful of cinnamon, 5 teaspoonfuls of 
baking powder, 5 tablespoonfuls of melted lard, 1-2 teaspoonful of 
nutmeg, i quart of flour, a little salt. 

CORN MEAL DROP CAKES. -Scald i quart of meal, and stir a des- 
sert spoonful of lard in it, when cool, beat 2 eggs in, stir in milk 
enough to make a thick batter: grease a stove pan or spider and 
drop them from the spoon, to bake until brown. Clabber, with a lit- 
tle soda in it, will answer in the place of milk or butter-milk. 

BUCK WHEAT CAKES. One quart buck-wheat, i pint of flour, 1-2 
teacupful yeast, salt ; mix with moderately warm water into a thin 
batter. Beat well, then add yeast, mixing well, and set to rise over 
night for breakfast. If the batter should be sour in the morning, add 
some soda, according to the degree of acidity. 

APPLK JOURNEY CAKES. Three quarters sweet apples, and 1-4 
tart apples peeled and chopped fine, a small teacupful of sugar, i 
pint of corn meal, and a large spoonful of white flour. Bake in

water, the yolks of 9 eggs, 2 ounces of pounded sugar, 1-2 tea- 
spoonful of minced lemon peel, a few pieces of candied citron 
cut thin. Separate the yolks from the whites of 5 eggs, beat them 
and put them into a very close sauce pan (if at hand a porce- 
lain lined is best) all the other ingredients, place them over a 
sharp fire and keep stirring until the sauce begins to thicken, then 
take it off and serve. If it is allowed to boil it will be spoiled, 
or it will immediately curdle. To be stirred over the fire for 3 
or 4 minutes, but it must not boil. Sufficient for a large pud- 
ding. Allow 1-2 the quantity for a moderate sized one. Sea- 
sonable at any time. 

WINE OR BRANDY SAUCE FOR PUDDINGS. 1-2 pint of melted but- 
ter (made of 2 ounces of butter, i dessertspoonful of flour, 1-2 pint

omitting the salt, then stir in the sugar and wine or spirit in the 
above proportions and bring the same to the boiling point; serve in 
a boat or tureen separately, and if liked, pour a little of it over the 
pudding. To convert this into punch sauce, add to the wine and 
brandy a small wineglass of rum and the juice and grated rind of 
1-2 lemon. Liquors, such as moroschina or carocoa substituted for 
the brandy make excellent sauces. Altogether 5 minutes ; sufficient 
for 6 or 7 persons. 

COMMON WINE SAUCE. Make thin a few spoonfuls melted but- 
ter, then add from a tablespoonful to 2 of coarsely pounded sugar 
and a glass of sherry with 1-2 glass of brandy, a little grated lemon

SAUCE FOR PLUM PUDDING. (Mrs. B.) Make a sauce of five 



SWEET SAUCES. 359 

beaten eggs, some white sugar, a gill of milk flavored with lemon ; 
stir over the fire till it becomes as thin cream ; do not let it boil; add 
2 wineglasses of brandy ; serve hot in a sauce tureen. 

EGG DRAWN SAUCE. (A Chicago Recipe.) Take a tumbler of cold 
water, add a well beaten egg, pour into a sauce pan, and set it on a 
stove to boil slowly, until it thickens. Stir in a dessert-spoonful of 
butter. Wine and sugar may be added. It is excellent with pud- 
dings. Try it. 

HARD CREAM. (A Cincinnati Recipe.) Take 2 cupfuls of loaf 
sugar, finely pulverized, i teacupful of butter, which cream, until 
white and springy, then mix the sugar and butter till like cream. Stir 
in as much wine as it will take, or cream with any extract preferred, 
place it slightly heaped on a glass or silver plate. It makes an ele- 
gant sauce for bread pudding, or any kind of boiled puddings. By 
stirring to it a large tablespoonful of stiff apple or quince jelly, or the 
grated rind and juice of an orange, or lemon, this sauce may be 
varied. 

COLD STRAWBERRY SAUCE. Rub the strawberries through a sieve, 
add to the juice an equal quantity of madeira, an orange, grated in 
sugar, and its own juice with a small spoonful of starch, boiled in 
water. 

SAUCE FOR ANY KIND OF VEGETABLES. Take a piece of butter, 
the size of a hen's egg, and set it over the fire, with pepper, salt and 
a little parsley, and an onion chopped very fine. Add a teaspoon- 
ful of flour, let it brown to a light yellow, then add a teacupful of cold 
water, thin it with new milk to the desired consistency, then pour 
over green beans, cabbages, green corn, lima beans, asparagus 
spinach, etc. 

COCOANUT SAUCE. Put a grated cocoanut over the fire with 3 
yolks of eggs, a cup of cream, i oz. of sugar, and 1-2 a glass of Mo- 
raschino ; work together well ; when set, serve in a boat. 

CHERRY SAUCE FOR SWEET PUDDINGS. (German Recipe.) One 
pound of cherries, i tablespoonful of flour, i oz. of butter, 1-2 pint of 
water, i glass of port wine, a little grated lemon peel, 4 pounds of 
cloves, 2 tablespoonfuls of lemon juice, sugar to taste. Stone the 
cherries and pound the kernels in a mortar to a smooth paste, put 
the butter and flour in a sauce-pan, stir them over the fire till of a 
pale brown, then add the cherries, the pounded kernels, the wine and 
the water; simmer these gently for 1-4 hour or until the cherries are 
quite cooked, and rub the whole through a hair sieve, add the other 
ingredients, let the sauce boil for another 5 minutes, and serve. This 
is a delicious sauce, to serve with boiled batter pudding, and when 
thus used, should be sent to the table poured over pudding. 20 
minutes to 1-4 an hour to boil. Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons, 



360 SWEET SAUCES. 

BOILING SAUCE. One handful of parsley, 2 sweet lemon verbena- 
leaves, 1-2 lemon, i carrot, all chopped fine, i soupspoonful pepper 
corns, 1-2 soupspoonful cloves, 1-4 good wine-vinegar, 3-4 water, 
salt ; for serving hot or cold, on a_ny kind of boiled fish. Boil a few 
minutes, put in the fish and simmer till done. 

VANILLA CUSTARD SAUCE. 1-2 pint of milk, 2 eggs, 3 ounces 
sugar, 10 drops essence of vanilla. Beat the eggs, sweeten the milk, 
stir these ingredients well together and flavor with the essence of 
vanilla, regulating the proportion of this latter ingredient by the 
strength of the essence, the size of the eggs, &c. Put the mixture 
into a small jug or pitcher in a saucepan of boiling water and stir 
the sauce one way until it thickens, but do not allow it to boil, or it 
will instantly curdle ; serve in a boat or tureen separately with plain 
bread or any other kind of dry pudding. Essence of bitter almonds 
or lemon rind may be substituted for the vanilla when they are more 
in accordance with the flavoring of the pudding with which the sauce 
was intended to be served. To be stirred in the pitcher lor 8 or 10 
minutes. Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons. 

OUR MOTHER'S SAUCE. Beat the yolk of an egg, add 1-2 cup of 
water, i cup of sugar, 1-2 cup of butter ; put into a sauce pan and 
stir over the fire till it is clear and thick. Flavor with vauilla. 

ARROW ROOT SAUCE FOR PUDDINGS. Mix a small teaspoonful of 
arrow root with a iittle cold water and boil a large teacupful of sherry 
or raisin wine with sugar enough to sweeten it. Mix the arrow- 
root with this and pour over the pudding. It is an improvement to 
rub a lump or two of the sugar on lemon peel. 

BCRNT CREAM SAUCE. Put 2 spoonfuls of sifted sugar on the fire 
in a small sauce pan, stir it, and when quite brown pour slowly in a 
gill of thin cream, stirring all the time. To be used as a sauce to cus- 
tard or batter pudding. 

ANY KIND OF FRUII MERINGUES. Fill an earthen pudding dish 
nearly to the top with any kind of stewed fruit, rather moist, then 
whisk to a foam the whites of 6 eggs and 6 spoonfuls of white sugar, 
then with a spoon lay the froth evenly over the fruit, set the dish in 
a moderate oven and bake for 30 minutes; at same time blanch and 
beat to a pulp the kernels of the fruit and stir it into the frost- 
ing- It improves its flavor. 

APPLE JAM (California). Equal quantities of sugar and good sour 
apples ; pare, core and chop the apples fine, make a good clear 
syrup of the sugar, add the apples, juice and grated rinds of three 
lemons and a few pieces of white ginger also grated; boil until the 
apples looks clear and yellow. On no account leave out the ginger. 

ORANGES FILLED WITH JELLY A beautiful supper dish. Take 
some very ripe, plump oranges, and with the point of a small pen- 



FLOWXS OR FLOATS. 361 

knife cut from the stem end of each a. round piece as large as a dime, 
then with the end of a tea or salt spoon remove the pulp entirely, 
taking pains not to break the peel. Throw these into cold water and 
make jelly of the juice, which must be well pressed from the pulp 
and strained as clear as possible. Color i -2 with prepared cochi- 
neal and leave the other very pale ; when it is nearly cold drain and 
wipe the orange rinds and fill them with alternate layers or stripes 
of the two jellies ; when they are perfectly coid cut them in quarters 
and dispose them tastefully in a dish with a few light branches of 
sweet myrtle around them. 

N. B. Calf's feet or any other variety of jelly or different blanc- 
manges may be chosen to fill the rinds, the colors, however, should 
contrast as much as possible. 

ORANGE ICING ORANGE DROPS. Mrs. Barringer, N. C. Make 
the orange drops by dropping very stiff pound cake on tin plates. 
Prepare the icing by beating together orange juice and sugar pounded 
till quite stiff. When the orange drops are baked a pale brown, and 
are cold, spread this icing over and set in an oven to dry ; put on 
only one coat of icing. They are delicious, and look pretty in a 
basket of mixed cake. 

N. B. They will be much nicer if the pound cake batter is flavored 
with the orange juice and grated rind. 

FLOWNS OR FLOATS. 

APRICOT FLOWNS. Butter a plain or channelled flown circle, 
which place either on a baking sheet, or en a tart dish ; line it with 
trimmings of puff paste or with thin short paste; cut the paste on a 
level with the rim, mask the bottom with a thin layer of sugar, pow- 
dered ; upon this sugar range halves of peeled, raw apricots, so as 
to pretty well fill up the hollow; sprinkle over sugar. Bake the 
flowns in a slow oven for 35 minutes, and serve cold. 

Cherry, peach, apple and pear flowns may be prepared according 
to the same method. 

CREAM FLOWXS. Put into a kitchen basin, 3-4 oz. of sugar, a des- 
sert spoonful of flour, add one after another, 4 or 5 eggs. Dilute 
the preparation with 4 gills of new milk, press it through a sieve, add 
a morsel of zest, orange, or lemon peel ; stir it over the fire for 2 
minutes only. Butter a flown mould, line it with trimmings of puff 
paste ; it should be thin. Pour the preparation in the flown, after 
having removed the zest. Bake it in a very slack oven for 45 min- 
utes; as soon as the preparation begins to set, cover it with paper; in 
taking it out, sprinkle it with sugar, withdraw the mould, and serve 
the flown. 



362 FLOWNS OR FLOATS. 

FLANCS OF FRUIT. This requires a tin mould, the same as for 
raised pies, it must be wiped well with a cloth, butter it, then take 
the remains of puff paste, and roll it well, so as to deaden it, then 
roll it out a size larger than your moulds, and about 1-4 inch thick, 
place your moulds on a baking tin, put the paste carefully in the 
moulds, and shake it well, to obtain all the form of the mould with- 
out making a hole in it ; put a piece of paper at the bottom, fill with 
flour to the top, and bake a nice color. It will take 1-2 hour ; then 
take out the flour and paper, open the mould and fill it with fruit. 

FLOWNS, WITH ANY KIND OF FRUIT, LIKE A VOLAUVENT. These 
may be easily made of half puff or short paste, and fill with new 
cherries and some powdered sugar over them ; bake together. 
Green gages, apricots, or plums of any kind, will require a hotter 
oven than lor only flour in it, the fruit giving moisture to the paste. 
NOTE. If baked in a slow oven, will be heavy, and consequently 
indigestible. These are easily made and equaly good as a side dish. 

ANOTHER WAY. If you have no moulds, make 1-4 Ib. of paste, 
roll it round or oval, to suit your fancy, 1-4 inch thick, wet the edge 
all round about an inch, raise that part and pinch it round with your 
thumb and fingers, making a border all round, put on a baking sheet, 
fill with fruit, one row, if large, two ; remove the stones and sift sugar 
over them, according to the acidity of the fruit ; it will take less time, 
too, than if in a mould. Thus, variations can be made with but little 
expense and trouble. 

FLOWNS OF APPLES. (A pretty party cake.) Take 8 pippins, 
Milam, or any firm, large, sweet apples, cut them in 4 pieces, remove 
the peel nicely, rub with lemon; put 1-2 Ib. of sugar in a pan, cover 
with cold water, juice of a large lemon, boil till a little thick, then 
add 1-2 the apples, simmer till tender, put them on a plate, and then 
do the other half in the same way, reduce the syrup a little, put the 
apples in a bowl, pour the syrup over. When cold, dish in a pyramid 
of crust; prepared like the flown of fruit, which should be a jelly of 
apple juice. Shreds of orange or lemon peel may be boiled with 
the apples. NOTE. Flancs of good eating pears may be made pre- 
cisely the same way. They should be cut lengthwise, dividing the 
stem in half. 

A PLAINER FLANC. Peel 8 pears or apples, and cut them in thin 
slices, put them in a pan with a heaped tablespoonful or more of 
sugar, the juice and rind of a lemon, the rind chopped very fine, put 
over the fire; stir till of a thick marmalade and tender, dish up; melt 
and pour over, and serve in a crust. 

APPLE SNOW. Take a pinch of powdered alum with 1-2 Ib of 
pulp of roasted apples, 1-2 Ib. of powdered sugar, the juice of i good 
lemon, and the whites of 3 eggs ; whip altogether for i hour, and 
drop on a glass dish. 



COOKING FOR INVALIDS. 363 

FLOATS. (Mrs. Ryland.) Whites of 6 eggs, 5 tablcspoonfuls of 
acid jelly, 3 tablespoonfuls of sugar; beat until light. Have a bowl 
3-4 full of well frothed cream, which has been flavored with wine, 
and sweetened to taste; place lightly on top of the first preparation. 

FLOAT FOR ANY KIND OF FRUIT. (Mrs. Currie.) Beat well the 
yolks of 4 eggs, whisk in 4 cups of new sweet milk, with a good cup 
of white sugar. When just come to a boil, pour into a bowl, then 
have ready the 4 whites, beaten to a solid foam, and pour this lightly 
over the mixture when it is cold, so that it may float Eat with the 
fruit. 

COOKING FOR THE NEEDY AND INVALIDS. 

WITH PROPER CONSIDERATION and household management, and 
care taken that nothing is thrown away, or wasted in the kitchen, a 
great deal may be turned to account, even in families of moderate 
means. Shoulder bones of mutton, so little esteemed in general, 
give richness to soups and gravies, if well soaked and mashed before 
added to the boiling. They are particularly nourishing for sick per- 
sons. Roast beef bones, or shank bones of ham, make an excellent 
stock for soup. When the whites of eggs are used for jelly, or cpn- 
fectionary, or other purposes, an excellent pudding or custard can be 
made of the yolks, beaten with sugar and bread crumbs, and sea- 
soned nicely. The remains of cold vegetables make an excellent 
addition to the soup, with a little rice or pearl barley. 

If those who are able, would just take a little trouble in assisting 
the poor, the expense would not be felt by them, which they could 
vary or amend at discretion. Where cows are kept, a jug of skim- 
med milk is a valuable present to the receiver, and a very cheap one 
to the giver. When the stove is hot, a large pudding may be baked 
and given a sick or young family, and thus made, the trouble is but 
trifling. Into a deep coarse pan put 1-2 pound of rice, 1-4 pound of 
brown sugar or molasses, 2 quarts of milk, a large spoon of dripping, 
set it cold into the oven. It will take a good while to cook, but 
will be an excellent, substantial food. A very good meal may be 
bestowed in .a thing called brewis, which is thus made : cut a very 
thick upper crust of bread and put into the pot where salt beef is 
boiling, and nearly ready ; it will attract some of the fat, and when 
swelled out, will be no unpalatable dish to those who rarely taste 
meat. 

PLUMS STEWED FOR INVALIDS. With a gill of water and a spoon- 
ful of brown sugar in a stew pan throw in i 2 French plums, flavor 
with a piece of cinnamon and some thin rind of lemon, let them 
stew for 20 minutes, then turn them into a basin to cool ; take them 



364 COOKING FOR INVALIDS. 

from the syrup and eat dry ; while stewing some add either port, 
sherry or claret wine and water. 

COOKING RAISINS. When scalded allow them to cook in a tightly 
covered vessel not opened until done ; they are plumper and more 
palatable, and can be eaten without injury to most dyspeptics. 

TOAST. Is much lighter and better made from a loaf that is 24 
hours old or more. It is preferable to- cut lengthwise of the loaf, 
leaving the crust, bottom and top, than around the edges of the 
slices. A fire for toasting should be free from smoke and flame, but 
clear and bright. The bread should be held on an iron fork with 2 
or 3 tines and a long handle, so that you can stand off and hold the 
l>read near enough to toast briskly, and moving it about so as to 
toast it evenly and prevent its burning in one part before the rest is 
done. Plates should be had hot in readiness, one on which to but- 
ter the toast and the other to slip it on after it has been buttered. 
It should be buttered on both sides and served as quickly as possi- 
ble, and not piled one on another, each round being on a separate 
plate. For buttering toast and hot rolls good salt butter answers 
very well, but for company fresh is far preferable. Toast for butter- 
ing cold or eaten dry should be cut thinner and baked drier than for 
buttering hot. The moment taken from the fire it should be put in a 
bread rack for the steam to evaporate, and to prevent its being moist, 
for if the slices are laid down for a moment and come in contact, 
they lose all their crispness, and will not be so much relished. 

DUTCH EGG SOUP. Beat up the* yolk of an egg in a pint of wa- 
ter, put in a little butter, 2 or 3 lumps of sugar, stir the whole all the 
time it is on the fire ; when it begins to boil pour it backwards and 
forwards between the sauce pan and the basin till it is smooth and 
has gained a froth. It is good when cold. 

SCOTCH BROTH. One teaspoonful of pearl barley into i gallon of 
cold water and let it boil ; add 2 onions, 2 turnips, 2 carrots cut in 
dice and i grated carrot, 2 pounds of scrag or back of mutton, or 
thin flank of beef; boil slowly for 3 hours, add salt and pepper to 
taste before removing from the fire. 

SOUP A LA CANTATRICE An excellent soup ; very beneficial for 
the voice. 3 ounces of sago, 1-2 pint of cream, the yolks of 2 eggs, 
i lump of sugar and seasoning to taste ; i bay leaf, if liked, 2 quarts 
of medium stock. Having washed the sago in boiling water, let it 
be gradually added to the nearly boiling stock, simmer for 1-2 hour; 
when it shall be well dissolved Beat up the yolks of the eggs, add to 
them the boiling cream, stir these quick in the soup and serve im- 
mediately. Do not let the soup boil, or the eggs will curdle ; forty 
minutes to cook it ; seasonable at any time ; sufficient for 8 persons. 

N. B. This is a soup, the principal ingredients of which, sago and 



COOKING FOR INVALIDS. 365 

eggs, have always been deemed very beneficial to the chest and 
throat. In various quantities and in different preparations these 
have been partaken of by the principal singers of the day, including 
the celebrated Swedish Nightingale, Jenny Lind, and as they have 
avowed, always with considerable advantage to the voice in singing. 

ECONOMICAL SOUP. Put 4 ounces of clean pearl barley and as 
much onion sliced into 5 quarts of wa'er, let them boil gently one 
hour and pour it off, then put into a pan about i spoonful of gravy, 
clarified suet or fat bacon minced. When this is melted stir there- 
in 3 spoonfuls or more of oat or corn meal and make the whole 
into a paste; next add gradually the brolh and bring it to a boil ; 
season with cayenne, black pepper or allspice. The flavor may 
be increased by garlic, shalot or some more onion. 

A NEW DIETIC SUBSTANCE FOR THE SICK Dr. Goodman, a 
member of the British Medical Association. This artificial febrine, 
as food, when taken into the stomach creates a feeling of want, 
rather than a decrease of appetite. The production of this sub- 
stance is within the reach of every sick man, and is effected with 
great facility. It is found by exposing albuminous material to the 
operation or influence of cold water for a given period, and on ac- 
count of its great plenteousness the ordinary hen's egg is employed 
for its production. When the shell is broken and removed, and its 
contents are immersed in cold water for 12 hours or so, they are 
found to undergo a chemico-molecular change and become solid 
and insoluble. This change is indicated by the assumption by the 
transparent white of the egg of an opaque and snowy white appear- 
ance, which far surpasses that of an ordinary boiled egg. The pro- 
duct and the fluid in which it is immersed must now be submitted to 
the action of the heat to the boiling point, when the febrine will be 
ready for use. 

NOTE As a febrine material it is highly nutricious and eminently 
adapted to all cases where there is a deficiency of febrine in the 
blood. It is perhaps unparalleled in its quality of lightness and 
digestibility, and is, moreover, a great delicacy. In many urgent 
cases of rejection of. food, &c., it will remain when an otherwise 
cooked egg would not be tolerated by the stomach. 

SOUP FOR INVALID. To a pint of warm water add 2 tablespoon- 
fuls of cod liver oil, shake them well until they are thoroughly in- 
corporated. Take a clove of garlic that has been steeped for some 
24 hours in senna tea and shred it into the liquid, season with rhu- 
barb and magnesia. Some forcemeat balls of the same size and of 
the samS material as antibilious pills. Brown with a salamander and 
serve. 

BROTH EEL, VERY STRENGTHENING. After cleaning a small eel 



366 COOKING FOR INVALIDS. 

cut it in slices, then put them into a small sauce pan just covered 
with water, add 2 button onions, a few sprigs of parsley, a clove, a 
little salt, then simmer very gently until the eels are tender, when 
skim off the fat, pour the broth over a sieve or strainer into a cup. 
It can then be served to the invalid, but only one spoonful should 
be taken at a time. 

NOTE The patient may be allowed to take some of the eel 
served with a little melted sweet butter and parsley. 

CHICKEN OR HEALING BROTH FOR THE SICK. Cut up the young 
fowl and put it to stew in 6 cupfuls or 3 pints of water, let it boil, 
removing the oil as it rises ; add a pinch of salt and mace to taste, 
as invalids require salt. Wash 2 tablespoonfuls of pearl barley in 
different clean waters until it ceases to be milky, and put this into 
the chicken water, then also add i ounce of marsh mallow root, cut 
up fine for the purpose of extracting its curative properties; boil i 
hour, then strain, bottle and keep ready for use, when it can be 
warmed over. 

ICELAND OR ANV OTHER Moss, AND CHICKEN BROTH. Wash your 
chicken, young and tender, thoroughly, divide it into four parts, re- 
move the lungs and place it in a stew pan with 4 ounces of the moss, 
a little salt and 6 cups of water, boil 3-4 of an hour on the corner of 
the stove, then strain it through a cloth and serve. 

IN boiling eggs for invalids let them get very hot, or the white just 
set. If boiled hard they will disagree with the patient, he not being 
able to digest it. 

SHANK BROTH OR JELLY, CHEAP AND VERY NOURISHING. Let 
12 mutton shanks soak four hours, then scour them very clean; put 
them into a stewpan with a bit of lean beef, a crust of very brown 
roasted bread, and, (if possible) an onion or any kind of herb and 
flour ; add 4 quarts of water, and let it boil as gently as possible for 
5 or 6 hours, then strain off. It will be a nice jelly and keep good 
for several days. 

RICE BLANC MANGE. Steep four ounces of well washed and 
perfect rice in water ; let it drain and boil to a mash in new milk 
with sugar, a bit of lemon peel, and a stick of cinnamon. Take care 
it does not burn, and when quite soft, pour it into cups, or a shape 
dipped in cold water. When cold turn out. Garnish with jelly. 

FRENCH MILK PORRIDGE. Stir oatmeal into a small portion 
of water, and let it stand until clear, then pour off the water and pour 
fresh upon it. Stir it well and let it remain unHi next day. Strain 
through a fine seive and boil the. water, and while doing s'o add the 
milk. This should be served with toast for the breakfast *bf weak 
persons. 

THICKENED MILK. Good for diarrhea in old or young persons. 



COOKING FOR INVALIDS. 367 

The nicest way to make it. Take 1-2 gallon of morning's milk, not 
skimmed, and put on to boil, skimming occasionally, break a fresh 
egg into flour well salted, stir it, and rub it between the hands until 
all the flour that can has been worked into it, then just as the milk 
reaches the boiling point, scatter it in, stirring all the time one min- 
ute will have cooked all the lumps ; pour into a basin, and then add 
a good lump of butter. This is a good and safe food any time of 
the year. Note. Always have 1-2 cupful of water in the kettle 
before the milking is put in, as that will prevent it from burning. 

TIGER'S MILK. An Indian Morning Draught. Beat the yolks 
of 3 eggs, add 2 table spoonfuls of powdered sugar, 3 cloves, the 
thin rind of 1-2 moll lemon, and 1-2 pint of brandy; pour over it 
a quart of warm new milk, grate 1-4 nutmeg over it, and serve 
immediately. 

MILK CREAM FOR THE SICK. HUNGARIAN. Stir the yolks of 
one or two fresh eggs and sugar together, and i pint of new milk, i 
table spoonful of rum or arak, allowing i table spoonful of sugar to 
one yolk of egg, which roll together until smooth. 

RICE MILK SEASONED (FRENCH) FOR INVALID. This, with riz au 
lait is nutritious for those who are recovering from a long illness. 
Drain a table spoonful of well washed rice, put it into a stewpan 
with two cups of milk, as soon as it boils, let it simmer until quite 
tender; add an oz. of butter, 2 teaspoonsful of sugar, a little salt 
and stir until well mixed, and serve when required. It must be of 
the thickness of common, well made water gruel. If wished add a 
few drops of orange flower water as the French do. 

LIQUID NOURISHMENT FOR SICK STOMACHS. D. M. J. One 
well-beaten egg, to which add 2 cups of milk and salt to make it 
palatable ; let it be boiled, and when cold, any quantity may be 
eaten. Note. It is useless if it turns to curds and whey. 

EGGS FOR THE SICK. Fresh eggs are a great comfort to many 
invalids. As soon as possible, after an egg is laid and cooled, dip it 
in a vessel of glycerine or gum arabic, dissolved with water to the 
consistency of new, warm milk, put them away in charcoal dust 
or fine dry sand in a cool place or dry cellar, and they will remain 
fresh for weeks. 

FOR POACHING EGGS. Each egg must be broken into separate 
cups, and from there carefully slipped into a large frying pan of 
boiling water. As soon as the whites become hard they are 
done enough and must be taken up with a spoon or flat shovel and 
slipped into a dish on toast and butter or rice, on sausage or on a dish 
with butter melted and pepper. 

COCOA. Cocoa is better than chocolate for weak stomachs ; while 
it imparts equal nourishment, it is better of disgestion and is made

by boiling in water for a considerable time, then pouring off and 
mixing with warm milk and sugar to taste; 2 dessert spoonsful 
will make a pint. If pure, it will nearly all dissolve. The cocoa 
paste is now very much in use, both as chocolate and cocoa. It 
is good and the method of preparing it, simple. Stir a large tea 
spoonful of the paste into a cupful of boiling water. This makes 
a cupful of nice chocolate, add sugar and milk to taste. A much 
smaller quantity of the cocoa paste will do, but a sugar pudding 
of milk is generally used. Cakes or toast is commonly eaten with 
little chocolate and cocoa. 

HONEY OR TREACLE POSSET. Into 1-2 pint of boiling milk, or, 
milk and water, stir a large spoonful of honey or treacle, let it boil 
up quickly, then set it aside for the curd to settle, and when it has 
done so, strain it for use. 

SACK POSSET. Beat 12 eggs and strain them ; then put 1-2 pound 
of lump sugar into a pint of white wine, mix the same with the eggs. 
Set the whole over a chafing dish and keep it stirred until scalding 
hot. In the meantime, grate some nutmeg into a quart of milk and 
heat it ; then pour it over the eggs and wine, holding your hand high 
while doing it, and stiring all the while ; then take it off, set it 
before the fire and it will be ready. 

WINE POSSET. Boil a quart of new milk with the crumb of a 
penny loaf, until the bread is soft ; then take it off, grate therein 1-2 
nutmeg and some sugar, put it into a basin with a pint of port wine, 
very gradually, or it will make the curd hard and rough. Serve with 
toast. 

ALE POSSET. Boil a slice of bread in a pint of new milk; take a 
bottle of mild ale in an earthen dish or china bowl ; season and 
sweeten to suit ; then pour the boiling milk over it; when the bread 
rises, serve it. 

MILK THICKENED. Boil i quart of milk and wet 3 table spoonsful 
of- fine sifted flour, roll it up in a soft smooth paste, and when the 
milk boils up, stir it in and continue to stir and boil for ten minutes ; 
add a pinch of salt to the milk, and when done, sweeten it to taste 
and grate nutmeg over it. 

STRENGTHENING JELLY. One ounce each of rice, sugar, pearl 
barley ; boil in two quarts of water until reduced to 1-2. Strain in a 
mould, sweetened and flavored to taste. A tea-cupful night, noon 
and morning. 

IRISH Moss TO PREPARE FOR THR SICK. Soak a scant hand- 
ful of Irish moss in strong soda water until it swells ; then squeeze 
the moss until it is free from water ; put it in a tin bucket which 
contains 6 pints of pure milk ; set the bucket in a large iron pot which 
holds several pints of hot water ; stir seldom, and let it remain until 



COOKING FOR INVALIDS. 369 

it will jelly slightly by dropping on a cold plate ; strain through a seive 
sweeten and flavor to taste. Rinse a mould or a stone jar with 
warm water, not hot; pour in the mixture and set it away to cool. 
In a few hours it will be palatable, eat with cream and sugar. Some 
prefer jelly. 

OMELET FOR THE SICK. A Nebraska receipt. Four eggs well 
beaten, 5 table spoonsful of sweet milk put in the eggs ; i table-spoon- 
ful sweet butter or lard (fresh), put the iard in the pan ; when thor- 
oughly heated, pour in 1-2 the eggs, when nicely brown roll it over ; 
then cook the other half in the same way. 

FOR DEBILITY OR Loss OF APPETITE. Eat a lemon with or 
without sugar before breakfast for a full week ; is better than 
medicine. Sometimes cures consumption. 

ANOTHER. Put 12 lemons in cold water and bring them slowly 
to a boil, then boil slowly until the lemons are soft, then roll them a 
little and squeeze until the juice is extracted, then sweeten with 
sugar ; use this in one day until you are better. If they produce 
pain, use only five or six a day until you are better, and then begin 
to use twelve a day again. After using five or six dozen, the patient 
will gain flesh and enjoy food ; then still continue the use of the 
lemons for several weeks more. This is valuable in sickness at 
any time. Note. To keep it well after boiling strain the 
juice, and to every half pint, add i Ib. of loaf or crust sugar ; then 
boil a few minutes until the sugar is dissolved, skim carefully and 
bottle closely. You get more of the juice by boiling them and it 
keeps better. 

BARLEY MILK FOR CONSUMPTIVES. Boil 1-2 Ib. of washed pearl 
barley in one quart of milk and a tumblerful of water and sweeten ; 
boil it again, and drink it when almost cold. 

CAUDLE. This was formerly and unanimously used as a tonic, as 
well as nourishing to women immediately after their confinements ; 
but it is now considered highly injurious from its heating tendency, 
both to mothers and their infants, which are now confined to more 
simple and rational diet. Candle has given place to coffee and sim- 
ilar morning refreshments. It has gone out of use except as a 
luxury. 

CAUDLE. Make a thick gruel or very thin mash of common oat 
meal ; for every cup of caudle required, allow 2 or 3 table-spoon- 
ful of the purest and best brandy, or 2 of brandy and 2 of pure wine, 
i spoonful of moist sugar, a few grains of spice and a little nutmeg. 
These should be put in a jug ; large enough to contain the whole ; 
pour the gruel to them boiling hot, and well stirred up ; then pour it 
into cups or glasses and serve with cakes, biscuits or dry toast. 

BEEF TEA, SOYER'S, NEW WAY FOR INVALIDS. Take a pound of firm 



370 COOKING FOR INVALIDS. 

beef, and cut into very small pieces, and put it into a stew pan with 
a teaspoonful of butter or more, 2 button onions, a salt spoonful of 
salt, a clove. Stir the meat round over the fire for a few minutes, 
until it produces a thin gravy, then add 2 pints of water; let the whole 
simmer over the corner of the stove or fire for 30 minutes, removing 
all the fat ; as soon as done, strain through a sieve. Passing broth 
through a cloth often spoils its flavor. NOTE. If the invalid wants 
it plain, the vegetables, clove and salt may be omitted. 

A BAKED SOUP. Put a pound of any kind of meat cut in slices, 
2 onions, 2 carrots, cut in pieces, 2 large spoonfuls of rice, 2 cup- 
fuls of split peas, or whole ones, if previously soaked, pepper and 
salt into an earthen jug or pan, and pour i gallon of water, cover 
it very close and bake it with the bread. The cook should be 
charged to save the boiling of every piece of meat, ham, tongue, 
&c., however salt, as it is easy to use only a part of that and 
the rest of fresh water, and by the addition of more vegetables, 
the bones of the meat used in the family, the pieces of meat that 
come from the table unused, rice or barley or oatmeal, gal- 
lons of nutricious soup can be made several times during the 
week. The bits of meat should be only warmed in the soup and 
remain whole ; the bones, &c., boiled till they yield their nourish- 
ment. Take turnips, carrots, leeks, potatoes, the outer leaves of 
cabbage, celery, or any sort of vegetable that is at hand ; cut them 
small and strew in with the thick part of peas after they have been 
pulped for soup and grits or coarse oat meal. In every family there 
is some superfluity, and if it be prepared with cleanliness and care, 
the benefit will be very great to the receiver and the comfort and 
satisfaction no less to the giver. 

What a relief to the laboring husband, instead of bread and cof- 
fee to have a warm, comfortable meal. How important to the aged, 
sick and infant branches, nor less to the industrious mother, whose 
forbearance from the necessary quantity of food that others may 
have a larger share, frequently reduces that strength upon which the 
welfare of her family essentially depends. Fish affords great nourish- 
ment, and that not by the part eaten only, but the bones, heads and 
fins, which contain isinglass. When the fish is served, let the cook 
save some of the water in which it has been boiled, add some 
drippings, an onion or two, some pepper, a little rice flour rub- 
bed into it after it has stewed, season with parsley or celery. It 
makes an excellent broth. The gravy of the fish may be added 
also, but strained. It makes a delicious improvement to the meat 
soup, particularly for the sick, and when such are to be supplied 
the milder parts of the spare bones and meat should be used for 
them, with little, if any of the liquid of the salt meats. As the 



COOKING FOR INVALIDS. 371 

poor like it, and are nourished by it the fat should not be taken 
off the broth or soup. There is not a better occasion for charita- 
ble commiseration than when a person is sick ; a bit of meat or 
pudding sent unexpectedly has often been the means of recalling 
long-lost appetite. 

Nor are the indigent alone the grateful receivers; for in the 
highest houses a real good, sick cook is rarely met with, and many 
who possess all the goods of fortune have attributed the the first 
return of health to an appetite excited by " kitchen physic." 

It rarely happens that servants do not second the kindness of their 
superiors to the poor ; but should the cook in any family think the 
adoption of this plan too troublesome, a gratuity at the end of the 
winter might repay her, if the love of her fellow creatures fail of 
doing it a hundred-fold. Did she readily enter into it, she would 
never wash away as useless the peas or grits of which soup or gruel 
had been made ; broken potatoes, the green heads of celery, the 
necks, heads and feet of fowls, the shanks of mutton, and various 
other articles, which, in preparing dinner for the family, are thrown 
aside. 

AN EXCELLENT SOUP FOR THE WEAKLY. Put 2 cowheels and a 
breast of mutton into a large pan with 4 ounces of rice, i onion, 
20 very small red or green peppers, and 20 black ; a turnip, a carrot 
and 4 gallons of water; cover with brown paper and bake 6 hours. 

CAUDLE FOR THE SICK AND LYING-IN. Set 3 quarts of water on 
the fire, mix smooth as much oat meal as will thicken the whole with 
a pint of cold water ; when boiling pour the latter in and 20 very 
small Jamaica peppers in fine powder; boil to a middling thickness, 
then add sugar, a cupful of well fermented table beer and a glass of 
gin ; boil all. This mess of broth taken once or twice will be 
of incalculable service. 

SCOTCH BREWIS. A strengthening dish.--Pour the desired quantity 
of boiling milk into the proper quantity of oatmeal in a bowl and 
stir it till it somewhat cools, add a pinch of salt, and without further 
preparation eat it. It is very sustaining. 

PRESENTS of bed-clothing, cast-off garments, such as old flannels, 
stockings, socks, body linen, shoes, bonnets, &c., are often very ac- 
ceptable to the poor, particularly in winter, when a warm wrapping 
of any kind, or some fuel would augment their comfort immeasura- 
bly. 

MILK PORRIDGE. Great care should be bestowed on the quality 
of the milk used for invalids and infants. First, especially, that the 
milk be fresh and sweet, for a smaller proportion of fresh, new milk 
diluted with water is greatly prefirable to a larger quantity of that 
from which the cream has been removed. Second, that it is by all 



37 2 



COOKING FOR INVALIDS. 



means best to avoid boiling the milk. The other ingredients should be 
well boiled and of sufficient thickness to admit the milk being stirred 
in to cool and to thin it. Either grits or oatmeal gruel will answer 
the purpose, to which has been allowed double the usual proportion 
of thickening, and in which a stick of cinnamon has been boiled ; 
when strained off add an equal quantity of new milk, a little nut- 
meg and if wished a small piece of fresh butter. Some persons 
prefer salt rather than sugar or nutmeg. 

ARROW ROOT (Indian.) It may be made either with milk or with 
wine and water ; a tablespoonful makes 1-2 pint. It must be made 
into a paste with milk or cold water and worked until no lumps re- 
main, increasing gradually the milk or water to 2 spoonfuls, then 
stir it into the remainder while boiling; when it boils a minute or 
two it will do. If made with milk it may be flavored with nutmeg 
or cinnamon, sweetened with loaf sugar (heavily), or according to 
the state of the bowels. If confined, moist sugar is better, if not, 
use the loaf. If arrow root is to be made of wine, a glass of white 
wine or a large spoonful of good brandy is the quantity for 1-2 pint. 
The sugar, wine and water may be boiled together and the arrow 
root moistened as directed with cold water. 

SAGO Soak the grains for one hour in cold water, changing the 
water. Simmer with a bit of lemon or orange peel till the grains 
appear transparent. When nearly done add nutmeg, cloves, mace, 
and allspice, with wine and sugar, all to taste. Then give the whole 
a boil up, and it is ready to be dished up. 

SAGO. There are two sorts of Sago, the white and the yellow, 
but their properties are the same. It is the pith of a species of 
palm. Its form is that of a small broad grain or berry. After it has 
absorbed the liquor in which it has been cooked, it becomes soft, 
transparent, and retains its original shape. Its properties are the 
same as arrowroot and tapioca, in an alimentary way. 

TAPIOCA. Take a large tablespoonful of tapioca and wash it in 
3 or 4 waters ; having done this, let it macerate for five hours in the 
water in which it is to be boiled, in a pan by the side of the fire or 
stove. Simmer it till quite clear, and add lemon juice, wine, loaf 
sugar, or other flavoring ingredients to taste, and a little salt. It 
should be boiled in a quart of water till reduced to one-half, 

CORN MEAL GRUEL. Mix a portion of meal with cold water, and 
then pour into a stew pan of water and let boil 10 minutes; add a 
pinch of salt. An excellent drink while under the influence of med- 
icine, in ordinary cases, and an excellent drink to take on a fasting 
stomach in the morning by those who suffer from constipation. 

GRUEL OF GRITS. A good flavored and most nourishing gruel is 
made of oats cleaned from the chaff, and slightly crushed ; by some 



COOKING FOR INVALIDS. 373 

they are called grits, in different parts of the country. The saucepan 
used for this purpose should be kept particularly clean and nice, and 
of block tin. One-half pint of grits will make 2 quarts of gruel, and 
after being strained off, the grits may be boiled again, and will make 
i quart more. To prevent it^from burning, the gruel should be 
stirred often from the bottom of the saucepan. The first boiling will 
require 45 minutes and the second rather longer. When strained off 
let it be set by in a clean vessel and in a cool place. In cold 
weather gruel should be made fresh every other day, and in warm 
weather daily. Some persons prefer a bit of butter and salt ; other as 
little sugar and nutmeg ; for sick persons, or women in confinement, 
the more simple it is done the better. When made very thick and re- 
duced with milk, this gruel forms a good milk porridge ; or thinned 
and enriched with wine, spirits, sugar and spices, it is called caudle. 

MEAT PANADO. Sometimes, when the stomach is too weak to 
digest animal nutriment in a solid form, it can be given in the 
form of broth or jelly, when the person has no appetite for meat. 
When this is the case, take the meat of a bird, rabbit, squirrel or 
chicken, (the white part) partially, but not thoroughly boiled, per- 
fectly remove the skin, slice it as fine as possible and beat it in a 
mortar to a paste with a little of the liquor in which it was boiled ; 
put a pinch of salt and nutmeg and a little scrap of lemon peel ; 
simmer it gently for a few minutes, with as much of the liquor as will 
bring it to the thickness of gruel. Beef, mutton, veal or venison 
roasts may be prepared in the same way, with a little of the gravy 
from the dish, if there be no butter in it. The white meats are the 
the most easily shredded. Or, it is a very good way, when a person 
cannot eat solid food, and yet needs nourishment, to lay two or three 
small pieces of toasted bread in the dish with the roast joint of meat, 
and as the gravy flows out let it drip on the bread till it is thoroughly 
moistened. 

DIET FOR CONVALESCENTS. An emulsion of raw meat 8 oz.,with 
21-2 oz. each of sweet and bitter almonds and white sugar, beaten 
together in a mortar until thoroughly incorporated. The almonds 
should be blanched. This compound may be beaten up with milk 
and water to any consistency. 

DR. RATCLIFF'S RKST. RATIVE PORK JELLY. Take a leg of well fed 
pork, just as cut up, beat it, and break the bone. Set it over a gentle 
fire with 3 gallons of water, and simmer to one. Add 1-2 oz. mace, 
and the same of nutmeg, stew it, strain through a sieve when cold, 
and take off the fat. Give a chocolate cup the first and last thing in 
the morning, evening, and at noon. Putting salt to taste. 

TAPIOCA. Choose the largest sort, pour cold water on to wash 2 
or 3 times, then soak it in fresh water 5 or 6 hours, and simmer it in 



374 



COOKING FOR INVALIDS. 



the same until it becomes clear ; then put lemon juice, wine and 
sugar. The paste should have been boiled in it. It thickens very 
much. 

EGG DRINK FOR WEAK INVALIDS. Take an egg, or the yolk of it, 
beat it well with sugar, then pour gradually enough brandy or pure 
whiskey to cook it, stirring all the time; or it can be beaten sepa- 
rately, stirring sugar to the yolk, then pour in the spirit; then enough 
milk to nearly fill the tumbler, then add the beaten white. 

HOMEOPATHIC INVALID CAKES. Mix to the consistency of rather 
a stiff paste, i cupful of fine flour and some good cream, roll out as 
thin as a wafer, make in cakes as large as a coffee cup, prick them 
with a fork on both sides, bake in an iron pan. Excellent for an 
invalid. 

HERB TEAS. Mint tea will sometimes relieve nausea; use, if pos- 
sible, the green leaves. Tea, of the white raspberry leaves 
with a piece of salt peter as large as a pea to a tumblerful of tea, is 
good for stranguary. Tea of mullen and sassafras will purify the 
blood. Cold teas of flax-seed and slippery elm, are good for colds, 
coughs, influenzas, etc. A little lemon juice is a valuable addition. 
Balm, catnip, pennyroyal, and sage, are good drinks in fever, to pro- 
mote perspiration. Use green or dried leaves in making these in- 
fusions. 

FOR THE SICK. (A Scotch Recipe.) Take the bran of oat-meal, 
soak it for one week, or until it sours, strain it. Let it settle, then 
pour off the dark water, then to keep it, occasionally pour off the 
water and pour in fresh. To make it, take the thick part, and stir it 
up with water, and stir it in boiling water, and boil for 1-4 hour. Let 
the patient eat it with fresh sweet milk. 

BUMANGE, FARINA, FOR INVALIDS. Mix with a little new milk, i 
oz. of farina, with a pinch of salt. Heat the remainder of the pint of 
milk on a double boiler, and when simmering, add the mixed farina; 
stir it constantly, until it thickens, when it must be turned into wet 
moulds. Serve cold, with thick cream, sweetened, flavored, and 
whisked till light and foamy. Invalids should not eat anything fla- 
vored with vanilla. 

CUSTARD PUDDING FOR INVALIDS. Put into a pan, 2 cups of new 
milk, with a little lemon peel, and 1-2 a sweet bay leaf for three 
minutes, then take out the lemon peel and leaf, and pour the milk on 
3 beaten eggs, then stir in a spoonful of sugar, and mix well together; 
pour into a buttered form and steam for 20 minutes, by setting the 
form in a pan containing boiling water ; let boil slowly until the pud- 
ding is done, then turn out on a plate and serve. The water should 
be halfway up to the rim of the form 

SPONGE BISCUIT PUDDING FOR INVALIDS. Take 2 cups of boiling 



CONFECTIONS FOR THE SICK. 375 

milk, flavored with lemon peel, which pour over a spoonful of sponge 
biscuit, and let it stand for 1-2 hour, then add 3 well whisked eggs, 
1-2 oz. of currants, and very little sugor. Pour into a buttered form 
lined with seedless raisins, for i hour. 

BROWN CAUDLE OR BEER. If made^ of corn-meal the gruel 
should be made very thick, enough so to admit of nearly an equal 
quantity of good, clear, mild beer, which should be stirred in while 
the gruel is over the fire, with a pinch of allspice finely beaten. If 
meal be used, it should be mixed with beer, and stirred into an 
equal portion of boiling water with pounded allspice a small portion. 
Then boiled sufficiently, strain it or not ; whether corn or oat-meal 
gruel, to each quart add a large table-spoonful of moist sugar, a rasp 
or two of nutmeg, 2 glasses of gin, or rather more than one of brandy. 

RAISIN GRUEL FOB THE SICK, (Dr. G.) Boil 1-2 Ib. of raisins, 
for one half hour, in one quart of milk and i quart of water; then 
strain and squeeze out, and return the liquid into the sauce pan or 
vessel and stir in and boil for a minute the article with which you 
are to thicken the gruel oat-meal, corn-meal or flour, as the case 
may be. The raisins make it sufficiently sweet, no salt is-required, 
but a little cinnamon or spice may be added ; when patients are fond 
of eggs, or do not object to them, as some do, the yolk of an egg 
may be beaten well with a little milk, and stirred into any gruel a few 
minutes before it is done boiling. This renders the article more 
nutritious, and, when the patient likes it, and can bear it, is a very 
good addition. 

RICE GRUEL. Take a large table-spoonful of rice flour and mix 
to a stiff paste, with cold water; then stir it into the remainder of a 
pint of boiling water, and let it boil for 15 minutes with a stick of 
cinnamon, and a little rasped dried orange peel ; strain it off, 
sweeten with loaf sugar, and add a half glass or more of brandy. 
This is commonly used when the bowels are in a very relaxed state, 
and it is desired to check that tendency. Much caution should how- 
ever, be observed, and, it is seldom safe to venture on the use 
of anything of a heating astringent nature without proper medical 
advice. 

CONFECTIONS AND CONSERVES FOR THE SICK. 

PEPPERMINT. Gather the peppermint when full grown and before 
it seeds. Cut it into small pieces, put them in a still and cover 
them with water; have a good fire underneath and when boiling and 
the still begins to drop, if the heat is too great, remove a small por- 
tion of the fire away, that it may not boil over. The slower the still 
drops, the stronger will be the water. The next day bottle off, and 
after standing 2 or 3 days cork well. 



CONFECTIONS FOR THE SICK. 

BITTER ORANGE SUGAR. Wipe a good sound, bitter orange in a 
clean cloth, rub off the yellow part of the peel with the sugar, scrape 
this off with a knife, pound and sift it, and keep it well canistered. 
LEMON AND ORANGE PEEL can be made in the same way. 
VANILLA SUGAR. A small piece of vanilla is dried in a warm 
place, then pounded together with 2 oz. of sugar, sifted and kept in 
a canister. 

Hip. The fruit of a rose, the fleshy part beaten to a pulp and 
preserved in sugar, is a medicine slightly cooling and astringent, and 
is often used as a basis of other medicines. It is a popular remedy 
for ascarides, or pin worms. 

CONSERVES OF ORANGE OR LEMONS. Grate the rind of an 
orange or lemon in a bowl or dish, squeeze the juice of the fruit over 
it, mix the white with a spoon. Then boil some sugar high, mix the 
fruit therewith, and when thick enough, put it into moulds. 
Conserve of orange peel is made by steeping the rinds in water, 
moderately heated, until tender ; and then straining and pounding 
them in a marble mortar. After this, the pulp is brought to a proper 
consistency over a gentle fire, with the addition of 3 times its quan- 
tity of sugar, the white is then rendered to a conserve by beating in 
a mortar. 

CONSERVE OF ROSES. Take i Ib. of red rosebuds, cleared of 
their hulls, beat them well in a mortar, and add by degrees 2 Ibs. of 
double refined sugar in powder until reduced to a conserve. 

CONSERVE OF ROSE OR THORNBERRIES AND HAWS. Useful con- 
serves are made of these hedge fruits, either separately or in equal 
parts, the skins, seeds and hair parts must be carefully removed, 
and that part alone used which is of itself almost pulp ; then pro- 
ceed in the same manner as with roses. A dram or 2 of these con- 
serves dissolved in milk is given as a gentle astringent in weakness 
of the stomach, phthisical coughs, and spitting of blood ; but to 
expect considerable effects, at least three or four ounces should be 
taken daily for some time together. In like manner conserves may 
be of orange peel, rosemary flowers, sea-wormwood, sorrel leaves, 
&c., but none are so valuable as the rose or thornberries and haws. 
BLACK PEPPER CONFECTIONS. Sir B. Brodie, P. L. One pound 
i ounce each of black pepper and elecampane root, i Ib. 3 oz. fen- 
nel seed, i Ib. 2 oz. each of white sugar and honey, this should 
always be accompanied by a mild aperient. 

CONSERVES OF LAVENDER Used frequently to sweeten the 
breath. Lavender flowers i part, lump sugar 3 parts, beat together. 
Using twice this weight in sugar, conserves of leaves and flowers are 
made in a similar way. 

CAMPHOR JULEP. Take one semple (20 grains) of camphor; one 



DUCHESS OF SUNDERLAND RECIPES. 377 

half an ounce of white sugar ; brandy or whiskey a tea spoonful ; hot 
water one pint. Pour the spirits on the camphor, rub it thoroughly 
with the sugar, and very gradually add the water, constantly stirring 
during the operation. Finally strain the whole through fine muslin twice 
folded, and bottle it. It is always readjfcfor use, and will keep in 
any climate. Note. This is very valuable where a medical man 
cannot be called in. It is antispasmodic in nervous and hysterical 
affections, convulsive sobs produced by grief, distressing hiccough, 
hysterical convulsions, and protracted sickness. The dose may 
vary from a half a wine glass full to double that quantity according 
to the severity of attack or age of the patient. 

CONFECTIONS OF ALMONDS. Sweet almonds 8 oz., white sugar 
4 oz., powdered gumarabic i oz. Macerate the whole in cold water 
then remove the skins, and beat them with other ingredients until 
reduced to a smooth confection.

To MAKE OYSTER SOUP. Take the bones from a codfish that 
had been left at dinner the day before and put them to boil in two 
quarts of water, 6 onions, 3 heads of celery, some pepper and salt ; 
more than 1-4 pound of butter, some pieces of bread, for 4 or 5 
hours ; when boiled strain it through a hair sieve ; beat up the 
yolks of 5 eggs and take a little of the soup and cool it, and add 
the eggs to it and let it stand in your tureen until you are going to 
serve it. Have ready 4 dozen bearded and stewed hot oysters and 
add them to the soup. 

A FAVORITE WHITE SOUP. Take 2 quarts of stock made of 
white meat, about 2 pounds of bread cut in thin slices and boiled in 
sweet milk ; when soft-pound it with a silver spoon untill it is quite 
smooth. You should add a good piece of mace and a little beaten 
white pepper. While it is hot add 2 or 3 ounces of fresh butter, 
stir it till it is melted and let it stand until you are going to use it, 
then pour it into your stock, give it a boil up and serve at once. 

A NEVER FAILING PICKLE FOR BACON, BEEF OR TONGUE, &c. 
Add to 4 gallons of water 8 pounds of common salt and i 1-2 Ibs. 
of brown sugar ; put the whole, to boil and keep stirring it till the 
salt is dissolved. As the scum rises you must continue to skim it off. 
When no more froth rises it is sufficiently boiled ; let it stand until 
perfectly cold. Lay your meat on a table, shake a little salt over

and under it and let it purge till the next day. (Of course the meat 
must be fresh killed). Then wipe it dry and pack it in the vessels 
you mean to keep it in. Tut a convenient weight on to keep the 
meat down, for if it is not entirely under the pickle or brine your 
meat will certainly spoil and be lost. If the above quantity is not 
enough to cover your meat, you must boil what you want with the 
same proportions as above directed. If you wish to have your meat 
red, add to the above proportions 2 ounces pounded saltpetre. Meat 
thus preserved will be good for 10 weeks. 

NOTE But if to be preserved for a considerable time it will be 
necessary to rub it a little with salt once in 2 months; also when 
your pickle begins to fret (spoil), which you may know by seeing a 
white scum rise, boil it again, take off the scum, and while boiling 
throw in 2 ounces of sugar and 2 pounds of salt. The pickle thus 
managed will hold good for 12 months. 

NOTA BENE When your meat is to be hung, wipe it perfectly 
dry. It is better not to hang it longer than a fortnight before you 
use it. 

THE BEST METHOD OF MAKING RISSOLE. Mrs. Flinn. Take 
chicken, turkey, or any other white meats, mince it fine, then make 
a little thick sauce with a small piece of butter, flour, a little gravy ; 
put the mince into it and stew it a little, add a little mace, nutmeg, 
salt and a very little cayenne pepper. When stewed put it on a plate 
until nearly cold, then make the rissoles in round balls, let them 
stand until they get firm, then roll them in the beaten-up yolks of 
eggs and crumbs of bread, repeating the same twice or three times 
until the rissole is looking firm and of the right size; then have ready 
some boiling lard, pop them into it, only 2 or 3 at a time, till of a 
light nice brown, then put them on a sieve to drain. Serve them 
with fried parsley on a napkin. 

To CURE HAMS From Wittege, cook to George IV. To a 
ham of 1 8 or 20 pounds, take i pound of bay salt, 2 ounces of 
saltpetre, i ounce of black pepper ; beat all fine and mix them 
together, rub the hams well with it, let them remain in this pickle 
for 4 days, turning and rubbing them every day, then put upon 
them i 1-2 pounds of treacle, in which let them remain i month, 
turning and basting them every day ; then take these out and put 
into cold water for 24 hours. They are then fit to be hung up. 

NOTE These hams do not require to be soaked previous to use ; 
only washed. A Westphalian recipe. 

To MAKE A PLUM CAKE, THE VERY BEST METHOD. One pound 
of butter^ i of sugar, i 1-4 pound of flour, i 1-2 of currants, 1-2 
pound altogether of preserved orange peel, citron and almonds, 8 
eggs, a little ginger, allspice, nutmeg and cinnamon, i wineglass of 



DUCHESS OF SUNDERLAND RECIPES. 379 

brandy, t of white wine. You will make the cakes as follows: First 
have all your ingredients ready, your flour and sugar finely sifted 
and dredged, your currants well washed and dredged, your mould 
papered, then take a pan, crock or flat pudding dishjand put your but- 
ter in it; if in winter, put it on the hot plate to get a little warm, 
then with your hands quite clean beat it to a cream, then add your 
sugar, and beat it on until it becomes very white and light, which it 
will be, if beaten half or one hour, then add 4 eggs and beat on 
for a quarter of an hour longer, then add the other 4, and by degrees 
put in the brandy and white wine, then beat in your flour, and when 
well mixed put in your fruit and your other ingredients, and when 
well mixed put in your mould. Your oven must not be too hot. 
Bake i 1-2 hours. 

FROSTING FOR THE PLUM CAKE. Put to the whites of 3 eggs as 
much very fine sugar sifted as will make it like a stiff paste, then 
with a wooden spoon beat and work it in your crock until you 
see it is becoming more a liquid, then add by degrees a little more 
white f an egg and lemon juice, and beat it until it becomes quite 
light, which it will in about three-quarters of an hour: then spread it 
on your cake with a knife, first having your cake a little warm from 
having it before the fire. It is not necessary that you should ice 
your cake the same day you make it ; you need not put it in the oven 
when finished, but set it at a distance from the fire and it will get 
sufficiently dry. 

To MAKE EXCELLENT SPONGE OR SAVOY CAKE. One pound of 
sugar, i Ib. of flour and 14 eggs; or i Ib. of sugar, 3 1-4 Ib. of sifted 
flour and 12 eggs. Take a pan crock, and put in your eggs and 
sugar together, and with a wire whisk, beat them well for 1-4 of an 
hour, then have ready your preserving pan of boiling water, and put 
your pan crock standing in it, and continue to beat it well, until it 
becomes rather more than blood warm then take it out of the warm 
water, and beat until cold ; or, if in a hurry, put your crock into cold 
water, continuing to beat on until quite cold ; have ready your 
shapes, buttered and sugared, and then add your flour gently with a 
wooden spoon. Bake i hour in a rather quick oven. NOTE. This 
same material, by adding a little more lemon peel to it, will make 
Naple biscuit. 

To MAKE AN EXCELLENT SPONGE CAKE. Fifteen eggs, 1 2 oz. of 
powdered sugar, the juice of 1-2 a lemon, a little of the rind, 12 oz. 
of flour, to be prepared as follows: First weigh your sugar and flour, 
have ready your pan crock, put in both your yolks and whites of 
eggs ; beat with a whisk 5 minutes, then put in your sugar and beat 
both well for 15 minutes, then set your crock in boiling water, con- 
tinuing to beat it well until the batter becomes luke warm, or about 



380 DUCTIKSS OF SUXDERLAND RECIPES. 

1-2 an hour, then take it out of the warm water and beat it till quite 
cold; or, you may set the crock in cold water for 10 minutes, still 
continuing to beat it, until cold, then shake in your flour, lightly stir- 
ring it with a spoon, then put it in your shapes, which should be 
greased with clarified butter; 45 minutes is sufficient to beat your 
batter, 45 minutes to bake it in a moderate oven. I find it better to 
bake this cake for a full hour. The above quantity will make three 
shapes. 

CAKE, SPONGE. A NICE WAY TO SERVE IT. Fill a tall mould with 
the batter for sponge cake, and bake ; when you wish to send it to 
the table, cut out some of the inside, and pour a quantity of white 
wine into it, then fill up the cake with the cream, and also put cream 
at the corner of each plate of each guest, when served. 

DUTCH CAKE. Two Ibs. of flour, i Ib. of currants, washed, dried, 
and picked, 8 eggs, 4 tablespoonfuls of brewers yeast, i oz. of pow- 
dered sugar, 4 oz. of butter, with one pint of milk ; let it stand i 
hour. Bake i hour in a shape. 

HAM CAKES. Cut the remains of a cold ham into small pieces, 
fat and lean, pound it in a mortar, season it with a little cayenne 
pepper; add about 1-2 a pound of clarified butter, put it into a 
mould and bake it for i hour. Let it stand till cold, then dip the 
mould in hot water, and it will turn out nicely. When broken, you 
will have to put it into another mould, smoother than the first, so on, 
until finished. 

LEMON CHEESE CAKES, THAT WILL KEEP FOR YEARS. Have 2 
large lemons and rub the rinds with one pound of loaf sugar, so that 
all the yellow part is removed, place the sugar in a basin, squeeze 
the juice of the lemon over ; then add the yolks of 6 eggs, and beat 
all well up, and put it in a hot place. Flavor with vanilla, cinnamon, 
or any other that may be liked, when required for use. It will keep 
a long time. Line your tartlet pan with puff paste, then mix i table- 
spoonful of the above mixture with a teaspoon of rich new milk, and 
place a little in each tartlet pan. 

RICHMOND MAIDS OF HONOR. This receipt originated with the 
maids of honor of Queen Elizabeth, who had a palace at Richmond. 
Sift half a pound of dry curd; mix it well with 6 oz. of sweet, fresh 
butter; break the yolks of four eggs in another basin, and a glass of 
brandy; add to it 6 oz. of powdered lump sugar and beat well to- 
gether one very mealy baked Irish potato, cold, i oz. of sweet 
almonds, i oz. of bitter almonds, pounded, the grated rind of 3 lem- 
ons. Mix these well together, and add to the curds and butter; stir 
up well. Line some tartlet pans (previously buttered) with some 
paste, fill the pans with some of the mixture and bake quick. 

GINGER BREAD NUTS. To i Ib. of the finest flour, well dredged, 



DUCHESS OF SUNDERLAND RECIPES. 381 

put 1-4 pound of fresh butter, well worked into the flour, then add i 
oz. of the best Jamaica ginger, fresh grated and sifted fine; 1-4 oz. 
of beaten allspice, 1-2 a large nutmeg, grated, and its weight of pow- 
dered cloves, 1-2 Ib. of nice moist sugar, one fresh lemon peel 
chopped fine. If approved, candied oranges and citron cut small 
may be added, and a good pinch of caraway seed and cinnni on 
bark in fine powder, and a small pinch of cayenne pepper, if likcu. 
All these ingredients are to be mixed into a smooth paste, with one 
pound of good treacle, and after standing a little time, cut into small 
pieces, and with the hands made into round balls, and then pressed 
flat between the palms of the hands, then set on a pan and baked 
in a quick oven. NOTE. About six drops of the essential oil of 
caraway seed will do as well as the seeds. 

MARINGUES. Beat up the whites of six eggs for 20 min- 
utes, and have ready 1-2 Ib. of loaf sugar finely powdered and sifted. 
Stir it into the eggs with a spoon, and drop this mixture from a 
spoon on - a clean board that has been covered with white sifted su- 
gar. Bake them in slow oven for 1-2 hour, and then fill them with 
cream, made as follows: Take i quart of cream that is rich and 
new, and add 'to it the juice of a lemon, and about i gill of white 
wine, beat it with a whisk for 20 minutes, and then sweeten with 
powdered sugar to taste. When the maringues are going to be 
served, put a spoonful of this cream in one and then adjust another 
of the same size to it. They are designed for the second course. 
The maringues should be put in moulds of uniform shape, before 
baking. NOTE. This cream will do for filling a chantille or sponge 
cake. 

To MAKE SPANISH PUFFS. Take half a pint of water, add to it 3 
oz. butter, put on a hot plate to melt it, then gradually, 3-4 Ib, of 
flour, working it in slow with a wooden spoon until it becomes a stiff 
paste, then add to it by degrees, 3 eggs (still working with the 
spoon) 4 oz. sugar and a little grated rind of lemon. Then 
butter a paper, and drop them the size of a hen's egg. And just be- 
fore going to table pop them into a boiling pan of lard, paper and 
all, and when sufficiently boiled, shake them off the paper on a seive 
to drain, and send them to the table quite hot. NOTE. You may, 
if you please, open the puffs and put a little sweet meats into them. 

QUEEN DROPS. 1-2 Ib. flour, 1-2 Ib. sugar, 3 oz. butter, 30 bitter 
almonds, 30 sweet almonds, 4 eggs. The butter a little warmed, 
then add the sugar, the eggs beaten well and separately, and the 
almonds blanched and pounded fine ; last, add the flour. One tea- 
spoonful dropped on paper on a tin pan and baked. 

To MAKE PINE SYRUP FOR TEAS. Pare the rind off very thin the 
thickness of a crown piece, have some lump sugar pounded and 



382 DUCHESS OF SUNDERLAND RECIPES. 

sifted through a hair sieve ; then lay a row of sugar at the bottom of 
an earthen pan, then a layer of slices alternately till all the pineapple 
is in; let them stand for 2 weeks till all the sugar is melted, then put 
the whole hi a preserving pan, let them simmer, but not boil ; do 
this three days running, then take the slices up and put them on a 
sieve to dry, then boil the syrup and skim it ; when cold bottle it, 
and keep the slices for dessert. 

APPLE JELLY. Take 60 or more of white codlings or any other 
white apples, take out the sniffs and stalks, cut them in quarters 
without peeling them, put them on to stew on a slow fire, being par- 
ticular to stir them frequently ; when they are reduced to a thick 
pulp put into a jelly bag and let them drain off till next day; then to 
every pint of the liquor, which ought to be thick and rich, put i Ib. 
of lump sugar, and to each pint put the juice of i lemon. Do not 
add the lemon juice till the jelly has been boiled and well skimmed. 
The lemon juice will then clear it. After adding the lemon juice give 
it one boil up, and taking it off the fire let it stand for 10 minutes 
without touching it, then skim it again and put into small oval pots 
for use. The jelly should be quite clear and not highly colored, 
which depends on not boiling too long. 

THE BEST METHOD OF MAKING APPLE JELLY. Take i dozen of 
sound baking apples, core them and cut them in pieces into a clean 
sauce pan without removing the peeling, add to them i noggin (a 
mug) of water, cover them close on the hot hearth untill they are 
stewed to a mash, then strain them through a sieve. The above is 
the syrup of which your jelly is to be made. Take 3 dozen of the 
best and most juicy baking apples, core and peel them, put them 
down in a nice, clean sauce pan, pour the above syrup over them, 
cover them and let them stew until they become quite a mash, 
then strain it through a jelly bag, and when cold add to every 
pint the juice of 2 lemons and a good pound of the very best 
loaf sugar ; boil it till it becomes clear and jellied, which it will 
in 20 minutes from the time it begins to boil. 

THE VERY BEST METHOD OF PRESERVING ORANGES WHOLE. Take 

6 large Saville oranges, grate the rinds lightly, cut a round piece 
about the size of a shilling off the stem end, take out all the pulp 
and put the oranges into cold spring water for 24 hours, and 
put the gratings to steep in a quart of cold water. The next day 
make the syrup as follows : Put a pint of water to the grating to a 
quart of the cold spring water, put it into a nice, clean, deep sauce- 
pan with 3 1-2 pounds of the best loaf sugar, 3 or 4 pieces of whole 
bruised ginger ; boil and skim it ; have your oranges boiling in a deep 
sauce pan tied up in a muslin handkerchief, put down in cold spring 
water. This you may do during the time you are making the syrup. 



DUCHESS OF SUNDERLAND RECIPES. 383 

Let them boil until a straw would nearly run through them, chang- 
ing the water to extract the bitter, then take them up and put them 
on a sieve to drain until quite dry, then put them down in the sauce 
pan without the handkerchief; let them simmer gently, keeping them 
constantly turned for 1-2 an hour; let them remain in the syrup all 
night (in a deep basin) ; next day add the juice of 3 lemons and a 
little more sugar to the syrup so as to make it the thickness of honey. 
Give the oranges a little simmer in it again, let them remain in the 
syrup while you prepare the pulps for filling them, which is as fol- 
lows : Take one of the oranges already prepared, chop it as fine as 
possible, take pulp free from seed and core ; add to it more than a 
pound of loaf sugar, first dipping it in cold water, and put it down 
to boil with the chopped orange, and when sufficiently boiled fill 
the oranges. When cold put on the tops or pieces cut out tied 
down with a bit of thread, put into a deep jar, cover them with the 
syrup, and tie the mouths of the jars over with paper very closely. 
The sauce pan should not be covered at all during the whole time 
of preserving the oranges. 

To PRESERVE PINE APPLES WHOLE. Put them in a sauce pan 
with as much water as will cover them, and let it just come to a boil, 
then take them out and put them in the jar they are to be kept in. 
To every good sized pine apple put near i Ib. of sugar, (double re- 
fined) into the water in the sauce pan ; let it boil 1-2 hour, skim- 
ming it very clear, then prick the pines all over with a fork, that the 
syrup may penetrate, which must be poured upon it in the jar. Boil 
the syrup every other day for 3 or 4 days, adding sugar each time, 
till the syrup becomes thick and strong, A middle sized pine takes 
up i 1-2 Ibs. of sugar. You must use some weight to keep the pines 
under the syrup. Sliced pine apples are done in the same way. 

To PRESERVE MOGUL PLUMS. Take 15 Ibs. of mogul plums, good 
and ripe, put them in boiling water, so that the skin may come off 
without breaking the plums. Have ready 7 Ibs. of powdered sugar, 
and according as you peel the plums, sprinkle the sugar over them, 
then leave them in it for 1 2 hours (or over night); then pour off the 
syrup on 8 Ibs. of sugar in your preserving pan, and boil it ; when 
boiling, put in your plums, and take them out again as quick as pos- 
%ible, put them in a basin and pour the syrup hot over them. Let 
them stand 24 hours, then pour off the syrup as before and boil it ; 
put in the plums as before. This is done 3 different days; the last 
day pot them. Boil the syrup, as soon as boiled, pour over them 
and cover closely. 

To GREEN MELONS OR VEGETABLES FOR PRESERVING. First scrape 
the outside of the melon with a bit of glass, so as to remove all the 
thin white skin, then take out the inside. Then have ready a thin 



384 DUCHESS OF SUNDERLAND RECIPES. 

syrup, put your melon into it, and when coming to the boiling point, 
take it off and let it stand for 2 days, and continue to repeat until 
the melon becomes quite green, then make a syrup with i Ib. of loaf 
sugar, i whole ginger and i pint of water ; then put the melon into 
it and let it come near boiling. If sufficiently tender, it is .finished. 

CURRANT BRANDY. To an even gallon of currant juice, add 1-2 gal. 
of pure spirits, and 4 pounds of sugar, tie or paste a cloth over the 
bung or car-boy. Let it remain for 3 months, then strain through a 
fine linen bag ; bottle and cork tightly. All fruit brandies are made 
in the same way. French brandy can.be used in the place of spirits 
if preferred. 

To MAKE CHERRY BRANDY. Press the juice*from 10 Ibs. of very 
fine marillo cherries by breaking them in a pan ; first have the stalks 
picked off. Press them through a sieve, pound the stones and mix 
them with the pulp, to which add 2 quarts of the best brandy. Let 
it remain for 3 or 4 days ; stir it often. Strain off and add 4 quarts 
more brandy, 5 Ibs. of pounded lump sugar, 1-4 Ib. bitter almonds, 
and put all together in a stone jar. Shake it often and let it stand 
10 days, then take it and add more sugar, fruit, almonds, or brandy, 
as you think proper, and after it has remained ten days longer in the 
jar, strain it off and filter through blotting paper in a flannel bag. 
t j ut it in pint botiles, which must be well waxed and sealed. In six 
weeks it will be fit to drink. It improves by keeping. 

HOH GOH. One ounce of bitter almonds, blanched and sliced, 
steeped in i quart of pure spirits, 12 days; i Ib. of loaf sugar, clari- 
fied in 12 pint of spring water. When perfectly cold, mix and 
pass through a parcel of brown paper, cut or pulled into shreds, in a 
flannel bag ; then bottle for use. It improves by long keeping. 

GREEN PICKLES. Sprinkle your gherkins, or cucumbers, etc., etc. 
with a plenty of salt, and leave them in that and the liquid they form, 
tor 8 days, then take them out and leave them 24 hours in a vessel 
of spring water, changing the water. Then take them out and drain 
them, and put them into a basin of spring water, with a piece of 
alum, the size of a pigeon's egg, pounded and dissolved in the water 
before adding the fruit, and let the whole stand for 12 hours. Then 
take about a quart of vinegar (pure fruit), in a brass, or bell-metal, 
or porcelain lined kettle, and put in the gherkins, etc. Set the ves- 
sel on the fire till the vinegar becomes boiling hot, then take it off, 
and stir the pickles with a wooden spoon, till they all become green, 
then throw the pickles into very cold water for a few minutes, which 
binds the color and detaches the greened vinegar from them. Then 
put them in wide mouthed bottles, and pour in your prepared or 
spiced vinegar for pickles. NOTE. The same greening vinegar will 
green over and over again for you during the whole season, by scald- 
ing as before, and should be kept in closely corked bottles.

N. B. There is is no pernicious effect from greening in this man- 
ner, and during the process the pickles should be covered over with 
grape or other leaves. 

PICKLED CAPSICUMS, OR CAYENNE, OR OTHER PEPPER^. The 
fruit should be gathered before it comes to its full size. Slit down 
the side to take out the seeds, aad then soaked in salt and water for 
3 days. After being well drained, cover the fruit with vinegar, and 
it is fit for use. N. B. No spice need be added.

CREOLE DISHES. 

STEWED BANANAS. First peel the fruit, then put it in a stew pan; 
add a little water and as much sugar as will make a good preserve. 
Excellent eaten with roast beef. (Mrs. McCoard, N. O.) 

FRENCH EGGS. Boil the eggs till hard, throw into cold water in 
order to slip the shells easily, roll in bread or cracker crumbs, fry a 
nice brown. Make a nice gravy of butter, crumbs, and cream and 
pepper ; pour over them. Serve hot. 

PICKLED EEGS. Take a dozen hard boiled eggs; when lifted from 
the boiling water into cold water, slip off the shells, stick cloves in 
them, and drop into spiced cold vinegar. Very nice. 

POACHED EGGS. (Mrs. D.) Set on the fire a frying pan of salted 
water, in which are placed as many muffin rings as it will con- 
veniently hold ; then break each egg separately in a cup and pour 
it then into the rings, boil from two to three minutes, take off the 
pan, remove the rings, then take up the eggs each on a sliced or 
perforated spoon, then serve on small slices of buttered toast, and 
while hot place a small piece of butter on each egg. Sprinkle pep- 
per slightly. Embellish with sprigs of parsley (double). Serve hot. 

STUFFED EGGS. Mrs. McCoard, N. O. Boil till very hard six 
or eight eggs ; cut them in half; take out the yellow and pound it 
up with bread crumbs, a little minced onions and parsley, fry this 
mince meat in butter, then fill the whites of the eggs; set in the stove 
or oven and bake a moment. 

STEWED EGGS. Mrs. Willoughby, Mobile, Ala. Boil the re- 
quired number of eggs, peel and quarter them, put into a dish, make 
a brown gravy seasoned to taste with pepper and salt and pour it over 
the eggs. Serve hot. 

STEWED OKRA. (Mrs. McCoard, N. O.) First soak the dried 
or green okra, put it into a stew pan with onions, cut up small pep- 
per, salt to taste, very little water, about two tablespoonfuls of sweet 
lard. Brown well a veal steak and add to the ochre, stew well to- 
gether. Serve hot, A nice dish. 



FOREIGN DISHBS. 

GUMBO FILIE, FOR 6 OR 8 PERSONS, (which Mrs. Edmund Ran- 
dolph's colored mammy showed her how to make). One large 
chicken cut up and disjointed, sprinkle over with salt and pepper; 
have ready a frying pan with lard, i large onion, i head of garlic, 
both cut up; when the lard is boiling hot, put in the chicken with a 
slice of good ham, fry till nicely browned. Have a gallon of water 
boiling. (If you have a quart of clear stock it is better). Put into 
the water or stock the chicken, adding 1-2 can of tomatoes or 3 large 
ones (with the skins taken off), 1-2 head of celery. Add also (tied 
up in thin muslin, spruce, sweet laurel leaves, parsley, cloves, chives, 
a large red pepper). Let these boil with the chicken, boil 4 hours, 
(if you have stock, only 3 hours). A few moments before you take 
these ingredients off, add your oysters, shrimps or crabs, and then 
sprinkle in your filie (buds) stirring all the time, until as thick as you 
desire. Two tablespoonfuls I find enough. Add salt and black 
pepper to taste. N. B. If crabs or shrimps are used in making the 
gumbo, then the meat should be veal. NOTE. File is the young 
leaves of the sassafras (ground very fine). 

How TO COOK THE RICE FOR GUMBO. Take a saucepan, put in 
i Ib. of rice, pour some boiling water over the rice so that it will be 
well covered, put in a little salt ; when the water has boiled off put 
more water in, by the time the water is boiled off again, your rice is 
done. The rice should be eaten with the gumbo. 

OKRA GUMBO. Is made in the same way, only the okra is cut up 
and cooked over an hour. NOTE. Either okra or file gumbo should 
be served with a large dish of rice, boiled very dry. (Mrs. Ran- 
dolph). 

CREOLE GUMBO. Have a large pot on the fire, put in three table- 
spoonfuls of lard. When hot, stir in a little flour, till brown, then 
add a good deal of ham, beef and onions, cut fine, crabs, shrimps or 
oysters. When all are well fried, pour on enough boiling water for 
the quantity of soup required, allowing for boiling down, as no more 
should be added afterwards. About five minutes before stir in the 
file (pounded sassafras) until the soup is sufficiently thick ; testers 
and shrimps should not be put in until some fifteen minutes before 
serving ; crabs with the beef, &c. Fry beef, then sliced okra when 
nicely browned, (no flour) pour on water; made like the above. 

NEW ORLEANS GUMBO. Into your soup pan put 11-2 spoonfuls 
of fresh sweet lard, 3 spoonfuls of flour, which stir into the lard until 
it is brown ; take a large fat chicken and cut it up in small pieces 
and put it in the pan with the lard and flour, and cover it up to stew. 
Then chop i Ib. of lean beef very fine, i large slice of sweet ham, 2 
large onions, sliced fine, i pod of red pepper, teaspoonful each of 
chopped parsley, marjoram, and thyme, and spoonful of salt; add 



FOREIGN DISHES. 387 

them to the other ingredients, with i gallon of boiling water, and 
boil briskly for 2 hours. When done take off the pan and stir in 
one and a fourth teaspoonfuls of soda. Send in a covered dish to 
the table; have rice nicely boiled; then into each plate put one 
spoonful of rice, as you pour the gumbo in, to serve it. Eat light 
bread or toast with it ; veal, venison or oysters may be used in the 
place of chicken. 

A TREAT FRIED BANANAS. Select a dozen fully ripe, the long, 
slender variety ; after removing the skins cut lengthwise, and again 
cut in two ; fry in the best of butter or ham fat, adding a little salt. 
Serve up hot for breakfast, and while eating thank the undersigned 
for this recipe. Bananas cut up with cream and sagar are a palata- 
ble dish for the tea-table. Mrs. L. F. Williamson, San Francisco, 
Cal. 

BANANAS AS A DESSERT. Remove the skins, cut the pulp into 
round, thin wafers, put them on a dish, put on a good deal of sugar, 
and add milk. f,et stand 2 hours, then eat them as you would milk 
and other fruit. 

To ROAST BANANAS. Roast or bake them with the skins on (in a 
deep oven) till of a deep brown and the juice comes through the 
skin, then serve hot and eat with a spoon. 

BANANA SWEET PICKLES. Make a pickle liquor as for any sweet 
pickles, peel the banana and drop them in it. Excellent. 

PINE APPLE SWEET PICKLES. Wash the fruit, peel and cut it into 
thin slices and drop them into a sweet pickle liquor. 

GUAVA JELLY. Miss Armstrong. Cut off both ends of the fruit, 
then put them into water and cook till soft then strain through a very 
fine sieve. 

A DELICIOUS BRAZILIAN DISH. Milk curds, sugar and the pulp of 
the plum to taste. 

PINEAPPLE PIE. (Sandwich Island dishes.) Miss Pogue. Take 
3 pineapples, and after skinning 4hem very carefully, remove the 
eyes ; grate on a very coarse grater until they are a mass of pulp ; 
to thi? pulp add i tablespoonful of corn starch, 1-2 cup of sugar to 
each of fruit. 

NOTE This amount will fill 2 pies; bake without an upper-crust. 
This is better cold. 

PINEAPPLE SWEET PICKLE. After skinning and carefully remov- 
ing the eyes of the pine, cut up into round slices with a bit of the 
core in each ; to 10 pounds of fruit add 3 of sugar and a quart 
of vinegar and spices ; boil together very slowly an hour at least. 
The next day pour off the juice and boil again ; turn over the 
pineapple boiling hot. It is ready for use at once, but keeps 
well,

STEWED BANANAS. The bananas sold in American markets are 
of the Chinese variety, and are nice stewed or fried. To stew 
them remove the skin, pack in rather a deep dish, sprinkle with 
sugar and lemon juice i lemon for 7 bananas ; set in a slow 
oven until they turn pink and are quite tender, without breaking. 
These are nice for lunch or tea. 

PLANTAIN AND BANANAS are nice baked with their skins on, and 
just before serving cut open lengthwise and spread with butter ; eat 
hot for breakfast. 

MUSLIN CAKE, Beat well and separately the whites and yolks 
of 10 eggs, i pound of powdered white sugar flavored with lemon ; 
stir in 1-2 pound of potato flour or potato farina ; mix well ; bake in 
a moderate oven. 

CASSAVER BREAD (native West Indian.) Mrs. K. Take the 
grated Yuca root, out of which all the juice has been thoroughly 
drained, add salt, then roll out in thin, flat, circular, wafer like cakes, 
very large ; bake on a sheet-iron or griddle out of doors ; when one 
side is brown, turn it over and bake the other. The bread should 
be 1-8 of an inch thick ; soak in your coffee and eat it. Use no 
grease in any way about it. It is excellent. 

TROPICAL FRUITS should be eaten in the fore part of the day, 
otherwise they bring on fevers. 

LOCALITIES IN THE TROPICS. Avoid all localities where fresh and 
salt water mingle. They produce malaria, and when the sun is hot 
keep in the shade, as you may have sun-stroke or fever. 

MORNING DRINK IN THE TROPICS. Drink a cup of very strong 
Java coffee, eat with it a roasted green banana or plantain roasted 
in a plantain leaf in the ashes. 

BOHOOKA VINE. (St. Domingo recipe.) Mrs. Kellogg. Scrape 
the bark off this vine and make suds with it and water, and wash 
your sores with it, arising from the process of acclimatizing, and 
this will cure the sores and prevent any attack of yellow fever. 

NOTE^ These sores 'seem to be an effort of nature to throw off 
malaria. Those who do not have them take the fever. 

TAMARINDS. (St. Domingo recipe.) Mrs. K. Shell the beans 
and put them up in jars with honey or with sugar. Bottle. A few 
of the beans put in a little water are good for fevers and act on the 
bowels. 

CARROTS. W, I. Mrs. Robach. Cut up your tender chickens, 
chop some cranberries, add a teaspoonful of curry powder and stew 
all together with butter and a little water.

RICE AND RED BEANS. Miss Chapman, West Indies. They are 
boiled together with a cover on the vessel till soft and the water 
expelled, then take off and allowed to remain until the steam ceases 
to come off, then poured into a deep dish and seasoned with pep- 
per, salt and some butter or olive oil ; stirred up and then served 
hot. If liked, cayenne pepper (a little) and the gravy of sweet ba- 
con may be used. Serve hot. 

NOTE This is a very popular dish among the West Indies. 

TOMOLES, Mexican. Mrs. Stepenson. Cut the green corn off 
the cob and grind it to a pulp, put fruit and meat of any kind well 
minced, whole raisins ; season highly with green or red pepper 
green the best, chopped then put it in green shucks or husks, one 
piece of the tomole in each, tie it up and boil it ; serve hot or 
in a dishes. Tomatoes may be used with the fruit. The green corn 
shock gives it the delicious flavor. A very small portion of salt to 
taste should be added before cooking. 

BEANS. Boil in clear salt water the beans till soft, drain through 
a strainer, then pour into another pot of boiling fat, stir, and then 
serve them hot. 

BEANS (Spanish.) Boil your beans till soft with a little port wine ; 
eason with olive oil. 

CHILIAN RECIPES. 

CHILI CHEESE. Chop the chilies and tomatoes very fine, salt to 
taste ; put a little lard into a pan and make very hot, add chopped 
onions and fry them, then add the chilies, put in some fresh or stale 
cheese cut or broken in small pieces and fry till it just becomes soft, 
but not melted. Serve at once. 

To COOK CHICKEN, THE LEG OF PORK, MUTTON, OR HAM. Take 
the leg of pork, ham, mutton, or a whole chicken, then with an in- 
strument make some holes in it; in every hole put in some ham, 
onions, in slices, black pepper, and some clabber ; put in a pan some 
vinegar, water and lard. Set it to cook inside the stove and 
turn over often to bake nicely; then add some more black pepper 
and clabber to improve the flavor. If you like, add some more pep- 
per very fine, some vinegar, black pepper, cinnamon. Make it very 
thick, slice some raw onion, and pour vinegar over, and serve the 
meat or fowl. 

BANANA OR PLANTAINS BAKED FOR BREAKFAST. Split the fruit

of sweet milk or more 1 , flour enough to make a thin batter. Fry in 
boiling lard, or olive, or sweet cocoanut oil. Excellent. Beat well. 

COCOANUT CUSTARD PIE. The grated kernel of i soft cocoanut, 
with the water or milk, or ripe cocoanut and milk, yolks and whites 
of 2 eggs well beaten separately, sugar to taste, a pinch of salt. Line

whisked batter in. Bake in rather a brisk oven. 

PANAMA STEAK WITH ONIONS. Fry in boiling lard, the steak, turn 
it over when, nearly done, cover it over with chopped onions, salt and 
pepper. Very nice. 

COCOANUT OIL. Grate the desired quantity of nice fresh cocoa- 
nuts, wash and rub the gratings between the hands for several waters, 
so as to get all the oil out, pouring each washing into another ves- 
sel, then set this earthen vessel on the back part of the stove, and 
simmer slowly, removing the oil as long as it rises, with a spoon. 
Then set the vessel, which contains the skimmed oil, in a warm 
place to settle, then pour off gently and bottle closely. Excellent for 
the hair. 

ANOTHER WAY. Grate the cocoanut, boil in a small quantity of 
water, carefully and slowly, skim off the oil as fast as it rises, then 
resimmer it in another earthen vessel until all the water evaporates. 
Pour off carefully and bottle and stop closely, leaving the settlings be- 
hind. This oil will keep the hair soft and moist for 3 weeks, without 
repeating the application.

as you can through a colander, adding a little of the water to help 
it through. Boil half a dozen potatoes with their skins on ; when 
done peel them ; put in a stew pan a large spoonful of fresh lard, 
half an onion chopped fine, and fry ; add two tablespoonfuls of the 
soaked peppers, two slices of bread soaked in cold water and 
squeezed dry ; add the boiled potatoes and slice in some fresh cheese 
and water enough to make a gravy. Stew a few moments and put 
in some hard boiled eggs just before serving. 

HUMITAS. Take two dozen ears of corn (not too young) and 
husk them carefully so as not to break the husks. Grate the corn 
off the ears into a dish and add an onion chopped fine, a table- 
spoonful of lard, and some salt and pepper, If the corn is very dry 
add a little cream. Put two leaves of the husks together overlap- 
ping the stem end and forming a sort of little boat , put in as much 
of the corn mixture as it will hold, Then cover with the sides and 
ends and tie into a little package with a strip of the husk. Make as 
many as your corn will allow ; put .them into a pot of boiling water, 
boil for twenty minutes. Send to the table in the husks, each one 
opening his own package. 

HUEVOS CHIMBOS, (dessert). The yolks of ten eggs beaten very 
light and baked in a square cake tin. Make some syrup of white 
sugar and water, not too thick. Cut your cake into squares in the 
tin it was baked in and pour the syrup over it; put it on the stove to 
simmer till the cake is well saturated. When cold put it all in a glass 
dish and stick some blanched split almonds on the top to ornament 
it. 

SNOW CAKES. Beat up the whites of 10 eggs, i 1-2 cups of sugar, 
i 1-2 cups ot flour sprinkled in, i teaspoonful of cream of tartar, i 
teaspoonful of essence of lemon. 

PAPAS RELLENAS. Stuffed Potatoes. Boil some potatoes, mash 
smooth, put in salt and butter, and line a pudding dish with them. 
Take some cold roast beet, and cut fine, add some chopped onion, 
thyme, parsley, salt and pepper ; put in a pan with some lard and 
fry it a little, add a little soaked bread, and if too dry, a little water 
or gravy. When nicely fried, put it in your potatoe dish, and have 
some hard boiled eggs cut in slices to put over it, then cover all 
with mashed potatoes and put it in the oven to brown. 

BAKED PEPPERS. Take green Chili peppers and take out the 
seeds. Chop some cooked meat, (veal is best) an onion, and 2 hard 
boiled eggs very fine. Mix with an egg (well beaten) ; fill the pep- 
pers with the mixture, after seasoning to taste, putting a piece of 
butter on the top. Bake in a rather quick oven until the peppers are 
tender. If the meat is very fat, some bread crumbs may be added, 
Jt is a good and economical way of using cold bits of meat,

CHUPE DE CARNERO. (Soup.) Take 2 Ibs. of mutton, such as 
you would use for mutton stew, and cut it in pieces. Put in a pot 3 
red peppers, a chopped onion, and a tablespoonful of lard, fry the 
mutton in this till a little brown ; add 3 quarts of water and boil 
slowly for an hour and a half; add a small cupful of rice, 3 or 4 po- 
tatoes cut in pieces, and a tomatoe. Cook till these last are well 
boiled ; season with salt and a little thyme, and serve. 

BRAZILIAN DISHES. 

MATTE, OR BRAZILIAN TEA. The leaves are taken from a wild 
forest tree, known as the Ilex Paraquoyensis, during the whole year. 
The leaves and branches are broken off and kiln dried in the woods, 
and afterwards ground or rather pounded in a mill. This coarse 
powder is then sent to market. For use, a little of the powder is 
put into a bowl, either with or without sugar, and some cold water 
poured on it. Boiling water is added when it has stood a short time, 
and is ready for use. It is drank through a tube with a strainer at 
one end. In the South American States the people say they cannot 
live without it, and that it is meat and drink. Being fatigued, per- 
sons feel refreshed at once by a cup mixed with river water. It is 
not so heating as tea. It is used largely. 

BRAZILIAN MODE OF MAKING COFFEE. Into a flannel sack put 
the dry coffee powder, say a pint to two pints of boiling water, which 
drip into a vessel to be placed over the fire until it comes to a boil, 
then pour over the coffee, once or twice, or more, according to the 
strength required, bring it to a boiling heat each time. This method 
preserves the delightful aroma of the berry, which is lost in boiling. 
Use with or without sugar or milk, according to taste. 

THE CINNAMON TREE is A NATIVE of Brazil, as well as other por- 
tions of South America and China. The trees are raised from the 
seed. A light and sandy soil is best for them. Trees in 6 or 7 
years are fit for peeling. Trees 2 centuries old bear abundantly 2 
harvests a year May and June, and in November. The bark being 
broken off in strips 40 inches in length from the trees, is collected in 
bundles for the purpose of fermentation. The epidermis is easily 
removed; it is slowly dried and rolled up in the form of a quill. 
There are three qualities. The best is as thin as paper; the inferior 
kinds are not worth transportation, but are used in making oil of 
cinnamon.

north, salt beef, put in water and boiled with sweet potato, (yuca 
root), yen tillia (sweet pepper) (dolce pica) sweet pumpkin, two of 
ripe and three of green plantains to above quantity ; let all stew till 
done, thicken with flour and water, and season to taste with sugar. 
This makes a wholesome and delightful dish. 

SPANISH BROWN BEANS. Wash and boil the beans for four hours 
in a plenty of water. Put a tablespoonful of lard or butter into a 
pan, when boiling hot, pour off the liquor of the beans, leaving a 
small quantity, then put them into the pan of hot grease, with 
a small piece of red pepper, some black pepper and salt. Serve 
very hot. NOTE. It is better when boiling the beans to add the 
red or green peppers, about 1-2 a pod, and let it cook with them, 
A nice dish. 

PISTO OMELET (A favorite omelet in Spain.) Mince together cold 
turkey or chicken and an equal quantity of cold ham or tongue, add- 
ing i chopped onion or 2 and sufficient sweet marjoram and sweet 
basil to season it well; also a little cayenne. No salt, as the ham 
will render it quite salt enough. Have ready sufficient well beaten 
eggs to make it into a good omelet mixture, stir the whole very hard 
at the last. Have ready over the fire a wide pan of boiling lard, 
put in the mixture with a ladle and fry it in flat cakes. Serve up 
hot. 

SPANISH SALAD. A Spanish proverb says that for compounding 
a good salad four persons are required. A spendthrift for oil, a 
miser for vinegar, a counsellor or a man of judgment for salt, and a 
madman for stirring up the whole, hard and furiously. Get a large 
salad bowl that there may be ample room for stirring well. Prepare 
in a separate vessel the lettuce and the seasoning. They should 
not be put together till a few minutes before the salad is to be eaten, 
otherwise it will be tough and sodden instead of crisp and fresh. 
Do not cut it with a knife, but tear or strip off the leaves of the let- 
tuce and throw all the stalk away, then wash the leaves through sev- 
eral waters and dry them in a clean napkin ; put them into a large 
bowl, and in a smaller bowl mix the seasoning, for which you must 
have equal quantities of mixed vinegar and water ; an even tea- 
spoonful of mixed cayenne and salt, 4 times as much sweet oil as 
the mixed vinegar and water. Mix all the seasoning thoroughly, 
stirring it very hard. Have ready on a plate some taragon finely 
minced or powdered; just before the salad is to be eaten pour the 
dressing over the lettuce and strew the surface with taragon. 

NOTE You may decorate the top with nasturtium flowers ; they 
are nice to eat. 

CUCUMBERS AND ONIONS. Pare and split the cucumbers, take out 
the seeds, and cut them into dice ; a handful of chopped parsley 



394 FOREIGN DISHES. 

and a dozen or two of small onions, butter, pepper, salt ; flour the 
vegetables, put into a stew pan ; when the butter is melted put in 
the cucumbers, stew till the onions are tender, adding a spoonful of 
good gravy and the juice of a lemon. 

TOMATO CATSUP (a Balize recipe ) Slice the tomatoes and put a 
layer into a jar, sprinkle salt over it, another layer of tomatoes and 
salt, until the jar is full. Stir the contents now and then for three 
days, then press the juice from the tomatoes and boil with mace, 
pepper, allspice, ginger and cloves ; about 2 ounces in all to a quart 
of juice; a few blades of mace, 12 cloves, a spoonful of pounded 
ginger and the remainder pepper and allspice. In 3 minutes boil it 
again with fresh spice. 

NOTE In tying leather or bladders over the mouths of bottles and 
jars it is best to wet them. 

To PRESERVE TOMATOES IN IMITATION OF GUAVAS. Take the 
seeds out of the wet tomatoes and set them over a slow fire in weak 
sugar and water until they are green, then take out the tomatoes, 
add sugar to the syrup, boiling it down till it is very strong and 
of a good consistency ; pour it over the boiling tomatoes and let 
them remain in it until cold ; then repeat the process as often as 
is necessary, but not sufficiently so to make them shrink. Should 
they be preserved ripe, pour the boiling syrup upon them, repeating 
it every 2 or 3 days until the sugar has perfectly penetrated the 
fruit. The addition of lemon juice squeezed upon the tomatoes, 
and a third or fourth part of strawberry jam mixed with the syrup, 
will assist in the resemblance of the tomato to the guava, as also a 
glass of port wine ; but, as these would spoil the color of green to- 
matoes, they must only be put to those that are ripe. 

To PRESERVE A MELON. Scrape off the thin outside skin, make 
a hole in the top, take out the seeds, then throw the melon into wa- 
ter, and after it has remained in it 12 hours take it out and put it 
into a preserving pan with a large piece of loaf sugar and as much 
water as will cover it ; then cover the pan closely and let it remain 
for an hour on a very slow fire. Repeat this process 3 times in 3 
succeeding days, taking care not to allow it to come to a boil ; then 
make a thin syrup, drain the melon carefully out of the liquor it was 
in and put it into a syrup, set it over a slow fire, closely covered, for 
1-4 hour every day for 3 ensuing days; on the last day boil the 
syrup until it is very rich with the rind of a lemon, adding the juice 
of 2 lemons.

of broken glass scrape the rinds of lemons, then without cutting 
through the skins score them lengthwise in quarters ; lay them in 
an earthen dish, not allowing them to touch each other; cover them 
with salt and place them near a window to get the heat of the sun ; 
keep them covered with salt, adding more, if needed. For three 
weeks turn them every day, then take them out of the salt and put 
them into a jar ; then make a liquor of the best fruit vinegar, bruised 
mustard seeds, ginger and long peppers ; boil it and allow it to cool, 
then stir in a very small quantity of turmeric, and then pour it over 
the lemons. Keep them closely covered. 

STEWED CUCUMBERS. Remove the peel from the cucumbers, 
flour and fry them slightly, pour off the fat, flour the pan, pour boil- 
ing water into it ; then stew the cucumbers in it until done sufficient- 

iy- 

STUFFED CUCUMBERS STEWED FOR THE ROYAL TABLE. (Madrid 
fashion.) Pare and scrape out the seedy portion of a large cucum- 
ber; then make a forcemeat of a little pounded veal, bread crumbs 
seasoned with salt, pepper, catsup, the yolk of an egg, and cream to 
make it to a proper consistency. Stuff the cucumber, fry it until 
brown, then put it into a good gravy and let it stew for 3 hours in a 
slow oven. 

MADEIRA PUDDING. This is a nice pudding, for which the Island 
of Madeira is famous. Take a tin cake mould of which the bottom 
will come out, butter it and lay upon it pieces of paste, the size of 
the mould, cover it with the preserve of apricots, then lay another 
piece of paste and cover this with red preserves, and so on in differ- 
ent layers with paste between them, until the mould is filled. Boil 
and serve with brandy sauce. 

Note. Great care will be necessary in taking it out of the mould. 
It will take a long time to boil it perfectly. 

SAUCE FOR BEEFSTEAK. Equal parts of catsup, wine and ale ; 
some butter, a pinch of pepper. Stir it over the fire in a sauce pan, 
pour it over very hot upon the beefsteak. 

GREEN ALMOND TARTS. Pull the almonds from the tree before 
the hull becomes loose, scrape off the down and put them into a pan 
with cold spring water, then put them into a skillet with more spring 
water; set them on a slow fire and let it remain till it simmers. 
Change the water twice and let them remain till tender, then take 
them out and make a syrup with double refined sugar and put them 
into it and let them simmer. Do the same next day ; put them into 
a stone jar and cover them very close, for if the least air comes to 
them, they will turn black. The yellower they are before taken out 
of the water, the greener they will be after they are done. Put them 
into the crust, cover them with syrup, lay on the cover, and bake, 
them in a moderate oven,

BOILED MILK FOR CHILDREN IN THE MORNING. Boiled milk, 
thickened with oatmeal, as thick as gruel ; a little salt should be 
added. This prepares the stomach for the food that may be taken 
during the day, both by children and adults.

ORIENTAL DISHES. 

A GENUINE ARABIAN RECIPE FOR COOKING LAMB, (kindly fur- 
nished by Mrs. D. who has for a number of years, been a resident 
of the Holy Land). The Arabians use sheep or lamb, and a great 
quantity of rice with it. One method of preparing lamb, is to take 
a piece of very young lamb, season it well with salt and pepper, 
place it in a skillet over a very slow fire, and allow it to fry in its own 
fat. At the same time take some clabber (curdled milk), and mix 
over the fire with a spoon until it boils. When the meat is nearly 
done, put it into the boiling clabber, and boil together for half an 
hour. Then take out the meat, and let the clabber boil until thick 
enough for a gravy. When served up on the table the lamb is put

back into the gravy. This is eaten with rice cooked in the following 
way: Throw the rice, with a little salt, into boiling water; stir with a 
spoon once or twice while boiling, but not oftener. After it has 
boiled five minutes, drain off the water, add some butter to the aice, 
and, as is generally done, a little yellow ginger, or powdered saffron 
leaves for the purpose of giving a yellow or gold color to the rice. 
Cover it up with a lid, set it back on the stove, and let it steam until 
quite ready. This rice eaten with the prepared lamb is considered 
by the Arabs, an excellent dish. 

ANOTHER ARABIAN DISH. (Mrs. D.) Wash in cold water some 
rice, to this add about three times the quantity of tender lamb, 
minced fine, some powdered thyme, parsley, and one or two onions 
chopped fine. Mix well together; then take some nice hard toma- 
toes, hollow them out a little and fill up the openings with this mix- 
ture, and bake in an oven or stew over a slow fire. The part of the 
tomato that has been hollowed out is placed in the bottom of the 
pan and on top of this is placed the filled tomatoes. Instead of to- 
matoes, cabbage leaves, or leaves plucked from the grapevine when 
quite young are often used. The leaves are first scalded in hot 
water, and then in each one is rolled quite tightly, some of this mix- 
ture of meat and rice. They are then pressed tightly together in a 
pot, covered with water, and boiled until all the water has boiled 
out ; if not ready then, more water can be added. But before they 
are taken from the pot for use, the water must boil out entirely. 
Sometimes egg plant and squashes are hollowed out and filled up 
just as the tomatoes. These vegetables, however, are differently 
shaped from those in America, being more like a cucumber in form, 
and more easy to hollow out, 

KISAILA. (Italian dish). Take a nice piece of beef about 2 or 3 
Ibs., and make about 2 quarts of broth; then take another sauce pan, 
a tablespoonful of butter, and a good sized onion, cut it 
fine, fry it in the butter until it gets nice and brown, then take about 
1-2 Ib. of rice, turn the rice in the onions and butter for a few min- 
utes on a slow fire, then add about 1-2 of your broth and stew it un- 
til your rice is soft ; grate some cheese and stir it slowly. A little 
saffron may be added to color it. After you have done all these the 
dish is ready to be served up. 

LARKS. Scald sour grapes and then stone them ; beat up two 
yolks of eggs with a spoonful of lemon juice, a very little flour, a 
bit of butter, and chopped parsley : season it highly with pepper, 
add a spoonful of gravy ; boil this a moment, then put in the grapes 
and stir them with a spoon on the fire to warm, without boiling. 
Roast the larks with bread crumbs, and serve them up with the sauce. 
REMARK. The sauce should be sharp and highly seasoned.

KIRBY, THE NATIONAL DISH OF THE ARABS. Many persons not 
Arabs, are fond of it. It is made of brayed or pounded rice or 
wheat and pounded fish or mutton, mixed with the fat from the large 
tailed or five-quartered sheep. When thoroughly pounded it is set 
on a copper dish made for the purpose and baked in an oven or 
stove. It will keep 15 days in winter, and makes an excellent lunch 
for travelers. When made of fish this dish is called Kibbet Samak. 

A FAVORITE DISH OF THE ARABS. Take a young, fat, tender 
kid, dress it carefully and then stew it in milk, generally sour, 
mixed with onions and any hot spices wished. 

AN AFRICAN DISH. Damsons (small black plums) when dried, 
stew with raisins or damsons stewed together with apricots ; fla- 
vor with sugar and cinnamon. This dessert is always relished 
very much by European travelers in Africa. 

CARACH SAUCE Oriental. Take cloves of garlic, cut each into 
1-2, 1-2 ounce of cayenne pepper, i or 2 spoonfuls of soy and 
walnut pickle, mix in a pint of vinegar with as much cochineal as

DR. GILLMAN'S RECIPE FOR SALAD OIL FROM DILL. Take about 
26 seres (pounds) of dill seed, first wash well and clean and spread 
on a table-cloth to dry in the sun. Pick it clean from all other seed 
and let it be thoroughly dried, then express oil in a well cleaned oil 
mill, carefully preventing its being stirred with a hot iron, which 
would spoil the oil, which is a common practice among native oil- 
makers. About 26 seres (pounds) of seed will yield 16 quart bot- 
tles of oil, and the whole expense will be but a trifle. 

NOTE Poppy seed may be used in the same way and propor- 
tions, and used for salad oil. 

FOREIGNERS soon acquire a taste for those Oriental dishes, which 
in tropical and semi-tropical climates are very conducive to health, 
when the blood becomes thin. This diet thickens it and wards oft 
many diseases. The authoress had an excellent opportunity to see 
this tested, and was often the guest of a famous East Indian house- 
keeper and an accomplished lady, wife of the then great scholar in 
Oriental literature and an author of many valuable works in differ- 
ent Oriental languages. 

VEGETABLE CURRY. Put 2 ounces of butter in a stew pan, then 
roll celery, onions and broccoli in curry powder; stew them till ten- 
der, add i cup of good gravy and a small quantity of mashed pota- 
toes mixed up with curry powder, and stew the whole together until 
sufficiently done. 

CORUNDA JAM. Put the fruit into a jar and boil it in a kettle of 
water until the juice is expressed, then add an equal weight of sugar 
and boil until it will jelly, which will be shown by putting a little out 
on a plate. 



FOREIGN DISHES. 399 

NOTE Country gooseberries may be made in the same way, and 
make an excellent jam, when care must be taken to preserve them, 
and use sugar alone, and not mix any spice, which spoils them. 

BHAMTA. An Indian dish. Mash some potatoes, and, having 
boiled i or 2 onions, chop them small together with a few capsicums". 
Mix the whole together very well, put it into a mould, or form it 
with a spoon into a handsome shape and brown it in an oven or 
stove. 

LEMON CHEESE CAKE THAT WILL KEEP FOR SEVEN YEARS. To 4 
oz. of butter allow 2 pound of sugar powdered fine, 6 eggs, leaving 
out the whites of 2, the rinds of 3 lemons grated, and the juice of 3 ; 
put them in an enameled kettle and let them simmer over the fire 
till the sugar is dissolved and it begins to thicken like honey. When 
cold, put it into sweet meat jars or pots for use. When made into 
cheese cakes add grated sweet biscuit. 

HYBISCUS JAM. Pare off the upper part of the fruit, and cut the 
seeds from the lower or stem part ; to each seer (2 Ibs.) of the fruit 
add a cup of water; put the whole in a stone jar, boil it in a kettle of 
water for 4 or 5 hours, take it out, weigh it, add an equal weight of 
sugar and boil until it will jelly. Hybiscus jelly is made in the same 
way, only the juice must be obtained before the sugar is added. 

STEWED PARTRIDGES. Take 4 young partridges nicely cleaned 
and put them into a deep cooking pot with a piece of butter and a 
little water; put them on a brisk fire, keep the cover on the pot and 
move it about constantly to prevent the birds burning or browning 
on the bottom. The partridges are sufficiently cooked the instant 
the red gravy is seen to percolate from the bird and mix with the 
melted butter. Serve them up hot with cayenne pepper and the 
sauce crust. 

SHAKAREE. Hunter's Soup. For a large hunting party, take the 
produce of the game bags, some 15 or 20 braces of partridges or 
quails, 3 or 4 hares or wild fowl ; add a good deal of pepper and 
salt, any odds and ends of vegetables out of the basket, and a bottle 
of each of the wine or beer that can be spared from the supply. Put 
all into the soup kettle, fill up with water and commence the stew, 
which may be entrusted to the masalchee (scullion); he cannot go 
wrong. Set him to work early in the morning and when the party 
returns from shooting in the evening, order all the meat to be taken 
out and correct the seasoning. Cut a single loaf, an old, hard, dried 
one will do as well as a fresh one, into pieces about 2 inches square, 
put into the soup and boil it, and serve the party out of the kettle. 

CITRON MARMALADE. Grate off the outer portion of the citrons, 
then quarter them, remove the seeds and put the juice and pulp 
aside ; then boil the skins first in the water and afterwards in sugar

into jars. 

HINDOOSTANEE KuBAB. Skewer on small silver skewers, alternately 
slices of apples, slices of meat cut into round pieces the same size, 
and halves of onions, so as to have 4 pieces each, i. e. 12 on each 
skewer. To 2 Ibs. weight take a dram of turmeric, 4 onions and a 
dram of red pepper, pound them in a mortar; sprinkle over, fry them 
with the kubab in a stewpan with 4 oz. butter. Send up boiled rice 
with this dish. 

A PEPPER CAKE. One half pound of flour, 1-2 Ib. of treacle, i tea 
spoonful of cayenne pepper, 2 eggs, a little ammonia, i tablespoonful 
each of coriander and caraway seeds. Make the treacle hot and mix in 
the other ingredients. 

TURKISH DISH. Chop some slices of beef or beefsteak very fine 
with a little parsley, onions and bread crumbs, powdered pepper and 
spice, salt and the yolk of an egg. Mix them together with a very 
little water, so as to make them into balls the size of an egg ; then 
flour them, place them regularly in a frying pan and fry them a good 
brown color with lard or drippings. (This dish is called quaffties.) 

BOMBAY METHOD OF DRESSING A FOWL. The fowl being trussed, 
incissions are made in every part, the same as when a fowl is about 
to be carved, but without severing the joints. The breast is cut as 
for taking out slices and the legs scored across. The whole fowl, 
inside and out, is then rubbed with pepper and salt and a little 
cayenne pepper or Chili, so as to be very highly seasoned. After 
this it is enclosed in a good, thick paste, composed of flour, milk and 
butter ; one end of which is left open to fill it with water, this being 
done, it is closed up and put into a cloth and boiled 3 or 4 hours, 
when it becomes a rich and most relishing dish. 

THE ARABS use the red rice generally procured from Egypt. The 
white rice, growing in Galilee, is inferior to the red, being much 
tougher. (Mrs. D.) 

THE HASTINGS CURRY. Brown 4 oz. fresh butter; slice 3 large 
onions and fry them. Cut the heart of a hard white cabbage very 
fine and a large sour apple. Put the whole into a stew pan, add i 
teaspoonful of cayenne pepper, i of black pepper, i of turmeric, the 
juice of 1-2 lemon, and a gill of strong gravy. Put in the fowl, flour 
it, add a little salt, put it with the rest of the ingredients, cover close- 
ly to keep in the steam and let it stew for 3 hours. 

PINE APPLE OR APPLE PALOO. Boil 12 oz. of rice in water; when 
only one quarter of the grains remain hard pour off one half the hot 
water, fill up the pan with cold water, shake it, then pour off all the

water and set the pan, covered, near the fire. When dry, add i Ib. 
of preserved pine apples with some syrup ; or, should pine apples 
not be obtainable, slices of apples boiled with sugar ; fry 2 sliced 
onions in 1-4 Ib, butter (fresh) ; when the onions are browned, take 
them out as they will be no longer wanted ; put 6 cloves whole into 
the butter and pour it over the rice, put the apples on the top and 
set the whole over the fire to swell ; keep it covered but stir occa- 
sionally. Plain curry should accompany this dish and be eaten with 
it. This is a very popular dish. 

A BENGAL PARAOARD PIE. Bengal Sporting Magazine. Take 12 
of the tenderest partridges, pick them, after picking wipe them clean 
but do not wash them washing meat in water, not only takes away 
its flavor, but its strength and put them aside ; put them into a 
vessel capable of holding, with well seasoned 1-2 mutton ham cut 
into moderate pieces ; add a sufficient quantity of water and stew 
until the gravy is greatly reduced; take all the lean parts of the mut- 
ton ham and pound it in a mortar, with seasoning of pepper and all- 
spice. The partridges and ham should be taken out of the kettle, 
and excellent potted game may be made of them, as they are full of 
rich gravy, impregnated with the flavor of ham. The gravy or soup 
is to remain until it is cold, and the fat is carefully removed ; season 
it with black pepper and spices, and stew the birds until quite ten- 
der, put them into a round pie, adding the pounded ham and the 
gravy reduced into a rich consummee. Cover the pie with a crust; 
bake slowly. It is to be eaten cold and will prove a dish that few 
princes can command. In hot weather put it into the ice basket a 
couple of hours before dinner. 

THE LUCKNOW RECIPE FOR PICKLING LIMES OR LEMONS. Bruise 
the limes or lemons on a stone, then throw them into water, and 
place them afterwards in an earthen vessel; cover with salt for 2 or 3 
days, shaking the vessel frequently ; take out the limes when they 
are soft, spread them on a cloth, and let them dry. In a hot coun- 
try the open air is sufficient, but in cold climates they should be 
placed by the stove. When dry, add vinegar and the juice which 
came from them when in the earthen vessel. 

R.HICHAREE. Boil a pint of rice in broth ; having steeped a tea- 
cupful of dried peas in water for 10 hours, boil them till they are 
soft; then slice 2 or 3 onions and fry them in butter, with 12 cardo- 
man seeds, a little white pepper, 6 cloves, and salt ; take out the on- 
ions, when browned, and spice, and add a cup of curds or milk to 
the batter, stew it a little ; distribute the onions, spice and peas 
equally through the rice, and pour the batter, &c., over it. Or put 
the whole in an earthen jar, secure the aperture with paste, and put 
it into the oven, or over a charcoal fire, for 25 minutes, adding suffi-

cient broth to moisten it; in which case the rice must be only 1-2 
boiled previously. 

BENGAL WAY TO BOIL RICE. Wash it well, boil it in a large quan- 
tity of water ; when very little of the center of the grain remains 
hard, take it off from the fire, drain off 1-2 or more of the hot water, 
fill the sauce pan with cold water, and shake the rice, then strain all 
the water off, and the grains will separate ; place the pan of rice near 
the fire to swell and the center part of the grains will become tender. 

PISH PASH. Take slbs. of the neck of mutton, boil it till tender; 
prepare a small teacupful of rice by bruising it in a mortar ; then cut 
the meat into small pieces, throw the rice, meat and onion sliced, 
into the water in which the meat was boiled, add a small piece of 
mace, and a few pepper corns tied in a muslin bag ; boil till the rice 
and onions are sufficiently done, take out the muslin bag, season 
with salt and serve up. Chicken, frogs or fish may be used in the 
place of the mutton. 

KOFTAHS. Pound in a mortar 2 Ibs. of mutton, beef, rabbit, or 
fowl, with a sprig of sweet marjoram, a dozen of red peppers, and 4 
onions ; form them into balls the size of walnuts, and fry them in but- 
ter. When the balls are well browned, make a gravy in the pan and 
serve them up in it. Serve up boiled rice in another dish. 

ZUNDER. Boil a pound of rice in a quart of broth until a small 
part of the center of the grain alone remains hard, then strain it; 
reserve a teacupful of the broth and boil in a spoonful of saffron ; 
then strain it, and pour the broth thus colored upon the rice. Kof- 
tahs must be served in a separate dish. 

DUMPOKHT. (the dish mentioned in the Arabian Nights as the kid 
stuffed with pistachio nuts.) Clean and dress a fowl or rabbit as for

rice in equal parts. Rub fine an oz. of coriander seed, peel from 
the husks 4 onions, 12 pepper corns, 6 cloves, and i teaspoonful of 
pounded ginger. Set 1 2 oz. butter in a stew pan over the fire ; rub 
the pounded ingredients over the fowl or rabbit, and let it fry until 
perfectly brown and tender. Boil in 2 pints of white broth, '12 oz. 
of rice, 2 oz. each of sultana raisins, pistachio nuts, and almonds, 
the two latter being blanched and cut into thin slices. When the 
rice is nearly tender, strain off the broth", and add the rice to the 
fried fowl; stir the whole well, that the batter may carefully saturate 
the rice and keep it near the fire to swell till wanted. In serving 
surround the fowl with the rice, Observe that in pounding the 
onions, the juice only is used with the spices, or they must be rubbed 
and pounded so finely as not to be perceptible. Chestnuts may be 
substituted for the pistachio nuts. 

CAUBASH. Mrs. H.'s recipe. The upper shell of the turtle is 



FOREIGN DISHES. 403 

called the calibash, the under calipee. Scrape the meat from the 
calibash, immerse the latter in tepid water, rub and wash it until 
the shell is entirely clean, wipe it dry, cover the inside completely 
with a light puff paste, take enough of the nicest part of the tur- 
tle (using the coarser pieces for soup) to fill the shapes, put this 
meat in a stew pan with a seasoning of salt, pepper, mace; or 
or any sweet herb used in cooking which may be preferred.- For 
a pound of meat take 1-4 pound of fresh butter, rub into it a 
dessert spoonful of flour, drop this into the stew pan, cover with 
cold water. Put on the lid of the stew pan and set it on the 
stove or a trivet before the fire, stew gently, skimming off all the 
impurities until the meat is tender; add a wineglassful of mush- 
room catsup, or any other preferred, the same of sherry wine ; 
stir all up and pour into the shell or calibash, put on an upper crust, 
making it large enough to fit exactly ; notch it around tastily, cut a 
slit in the center. Should there not be gravy enough, pour in suffi- 
cient boiling water to answer. Bake a light brown, send to the table 
on a square dish to fit as nicely as possible the shell. When well 
arranged this is a dish as beautiful as savory. 

"ANGELS ON HORSEBACK." Select a dozen large oysters, which, 
after removing their beards as well as the color parts, put the flesh 
into a plate and season with pepper and salt ; blanch a piece of old 
bacon ; when cold cut it in thin strips, out of which again cut squares 
of the diameter of the oysters ; take the oysters, one by one; pile 
them on little silver skewers , alternating each of the oysters by a 
little square of bacon ; give 6 oysters to each of the skewers, sprin- 
kle over the oysters a little bread crumbs mixed with chopped pars- 
ley; broil the oysters at a brisk fire, but observe for 3 minutes only ; 
dish the skewers, placing them on a little crouton of bread, fried in 
butter and kept hot. 

TURKISH MODE OF ROASTING LAMB. Put the whole lamb, after 
it is stuffed with currants, almonds and pistachio nut (which should 
be blanched and peeled), into a deep dish and covered, set it in a 
hole in the ground, then cover over with burning wooden coals.

months ; 2 tablespoonfuls of this mixture in 2-3 glass of ice water ; 
to be poured into a goblet when ready to drink. If a little soda is 
added it will effervesce beautifully. 

RASPBERRY NECTAR. Put into a jar fully ripe rasberries and allow 
i quart of good apple vinegar to every 2 quarts of the berries. 
After fermenting strain, and to every quart of juice allow i 1-2 Ibs. 
of loaf sugar. Simmer for 20 minutes. 

CHERRY NECTAR. Wash and pick and stone 1-2 of 6 pounds of

keep in a cool, dry place. Mix half and half with water, adding a 
little ice. The water should be very cold. A delightful summer 
drink. 

WHITE WINK WHEY FOR COLDS. This will produce perspiration 
in cases of colds. Take 1-2 pint of milk and put it on the fire in a 
sauce pan, and immediately that it boils, put into it 2 glasses of white 
wine with a little sugar dissolved in it. A light floating curd will be 
instantly seen; boil for a few minutes, pour it through a sieve so that 
the whey may run from the curd. Serve the whey hot ; throw away 
the curd, for it is exceedingly indigestible and should not be eaten. 

HARVEST DRINK. (Scotch.) Buttermilk or whey, the latter is the 
whey poured from the milk after it has boiled in a kettle, when an 
other curd will be formed, then with the whip the last curd forma- 
tion is broken but not removed. It is then taken to the harvest 
field in clean buckets for the laborers, and forms a very sustaining 
drink and may be eaten with bread and cheese, a little meat or salt 
bacon. 

A HONEY MEAD. With 16 quarts of honey mix the whites of 3 
eggs beaten to a strong froth, 6 gals, of water and the yellow rind of

barrelled with a bag of spices in it. 

APPLE WATER. Pare, core and cut into very thin slices 3 large 
juicy apples, put them in a pitcher, and if you have it, the rind of a 
lemon pared thin, and pour on a pint of boiling water, cover it close- 
ly and let it stand by the fire for an hour or 2. Let it cool and pour 
the liquid in a glass and sweeten with loaf sugar. It is a cooling 
drink in fevers, and should be taken warm when going to bed, for 
colds. 

CHERRY WATER. Pick 2 Ibs. of Mayduke cherries, put them into 
a basin, pour over them 3 quarts of boiling water and let them steep 
for 2 hours ; filter through a flannel bag with some paper. To the 
filtered juice add i quart of warm syrup. Mix hot and pour the 
cherry water into glass bottles. 

BLACK CHERRY WATER. Crush 6 Ibs. of black cherries and to 
them put a handful each of the tops of marigold, angelica, rosemary, 
spearmint, balm and sweet marjoram, 1-2 oz. each of sweet fennel 
and anis-seed, i oz. of dried violets. Cut the herbs small, mix them 
all together and distill them in a cold still. 

CRANBERRY WATER. Bruise a cupful of cranberries mixed with a 
cupful of cold water. Boil 2 quarts of water with a tablespoonful of 
oatmeal and the rind of a lemon, then stir in the cranberries and add 
2 oz. of loaf sugar and 1-4 pint of white wine ; simmer for a 1-4 of 
an hour. 

CURRANT WATER. Press 1-2 pint of raspberries and i quart of 
currants into a basin, add 2 quarts of water and filter through a flan- 
nel bag, at the bottom of which is a pulp of brown paper ; add i 
quart of warm syrup of sugar to the filtered juice. Mix, and pour 
the currant water into glass bottles. 

GINGER POP. 10 quarts of water, i pound of coarse brown 
sugar (but the loaf is better, and more wholesome), 2 ounces of 
ground white ginger, i quart of ale or very strong beer. 



REFRESHING DRINKS. 409 

GINGER POP No. 2. Take 3-4 pound ginger root, crushed ; 
2 3-4 pounds white sugar, 1-2 ounce tartaric acid, 5 1-2 gallons 
soft water, whites of 3 eggs, well beaten, i gill of yeast, i small 
teaspoonful of lemon oil; boil the ginger root for 12 hours in i 
gallon of the water, strain off and pour the oil in while hot ; mix. 
Make over night; in the morning skim and bottle, keeping out 
the sediment. 

IMPERIAL POP. To i gallon of water add i 1-2 pounds of white 
sugar, i ounce ginger, juice of i lemon, 3 ounces cream tartar; 
work it with yeast and bottle it as ginger beer, to which it is similar, 
except it is more acid and more cooling in its medicinal properties. 

SHERBET (domestic.) Boil in 3 pints of water 6 or 8 stalks of 
green rhubarb, 4 ounces of raisins or figs ; when the water has 
boiled 1-2 hour strain it, and mix with it i teaspoonful of rose- 
water and orange or lemon syrup to taste. Drink cold. 

LEMON SHERBET (King's cup.) Two lemons sliced, 2 ounces of 
sugar, i pint boiling water; very fine. 

CALIFORNIA SHERBET. Rub the yellow rind of 3 lemons with 
lumps of sugar, squeeze the juice of 6 carefully out, remove the 
seeds, put the sugar and juice with i pound of nice white sugar 
in 1-2 gallon of water. Beat to a stiff froth the whites of 5 eggs 
and stir in 2 tablespoonfuls of fine sugar ; in them then slowly 
stir in the lemonade and put it immediately in a patent freezer with 
salt and ice around the freezer and turn it until frozen as hard as you 
wish it. This is very delicate, and resembles a dish of snow. Plain 
freezers will not do for this, as it must be constantly stirred to keep 
it well mixed. 

SHRUB (West India.) Make a syrup of 12 pounds of the best 
moist sugar, to which add 3 quarts of lime juice and 9 quarts of 
rum, mixing them well together and fining the liquid with isinglass 
in the same manner as wine. A few pints of brandy or less rum 
is a great improvement. 

SHERBET. Pare 12 good, ripe oranges and 4 large, ripe lemons 
very thin, boil 4 pounds of loaf sugar in a half gallon of water ; mix 
together the boiling syrup, the rind of the fruit, the juice and 10 pints 
more of water ; strain, bottle and cork tightly. 

WATERMELON SHERBET. A Bengal recipe. Cut the melon into 
halves, let the pulp be worked and mashed with a spoon until it 
assumes the consistency of thin mush, then put in as much pounded 
white candy or sugar as may suit your taste ; a wineglassful of fresh 
rose-water and 2 wineglasses of sherry. Strain and pour the liquor 
into a jug and fill your tumblers at pleasure. It is an agreeable 
summer drink. 

BLACKBERRY SHERBET. Take 2 pounds of the smaller blackberry 



410 REFRESHING DRINKS. 

roots and 2 gallons of water, and boil them down to 3 quarts, add 5 
pounds of crushed sugar and i pint of best brandy. To 60 gallons 
thus prepared add 3 pounds of allspice and 2 pounds each of cassia 
and cloves. The smaller roots are much better than the larger ones 
on account of their possessing superior astringent qualities. 

A VERY PLEASANT DRINK WHEN FEVERISH OR IN HOT WEATHER. 

Mash i pint of raspberries, strawberries, cherries or mulberries in 
the juice of 2 lemons, a pint of water and as much syrup as will 
sweeten it to taste ; strain through a lawn sieve. 

A DELIGHTFUL AND REFRESHING BEVERAGE. Slice'and put into 
a pitcher 2 rich, juicy oranges and i lemon with 2 ozs. of sugar 
candy, then pour over them 2 pints of boiling water ; with a silver 
spoon stir the mixture now and then till cold. This drink for patients 
is often directed by the physician. It is always good in warm 
weather, and is excellent for persons in health. 

CHERRY DRINK. Remove the stems and stones from i pound of 
plump, ripe, juicy cherries, then put them in a stew pan containing 
a pint of boiling syrup, and boil them rapidly for 10 or 12 minutes ; 
remove them from the fire and pour in a gill of sherry or Madeira 
wine and 2 pints of boiling water, then pour the whole into a pitcher 
and set a saucer or cup over it ; when cool, strain it, and it is then 
ready for use. If not fancied, the wine need not be added. 

NOTE Mulberries may be substituted for the cherries, u?ing a 
little lemon juice with the mulberries. 

RUSSIAN HARVEST DRINK. Cold black tea with sugar and lemon 
juice enough to make it pleasant. It is as safe as invigorating. It 
should be of the same temperature as the atmosphere. It at once 
invigorates and gives tone to the system. The acid increases the 
action of the liver and cools the system, while the sugar nourishes 
and supports the body. 

TAR WATER. i gallon of water, 2 pints of pure tar. Stir with a 
wooden rod till thoroughly mixed, then strain and keep the liquid in 
well-stopped bottles. It is frequently used as a remedy for bron- 
chitis. It acts as a stimulant, raising the pulse, increasing the dis- 
charge of the skin and kidneys. Take from i to 2 pints daily. 

WEST INDIAN SAUGAREE Dissolve 4 ounces of sugar in a large 
wineglass of lime juice, grate into it 1-2 nutmeg; add i quart of 
cold water, a little Madeira and 1-4 pint of brandy. A lump of ice 
renders the saugaree perfect. 

MINT JULEP. Take 3 or 4 young sprigs of mint, fresh gathered, 
and put in a tumbler, fill it 1-2 with sherry, put some pounded ice 
in a second tumbler and pour the mint and sherry over it, rapidly 
transferring the liquor several times from one tumbler to another ; 
finally place the tumbler a minute on ice till the frozen particles 
form over the top.

CALIFORNIA LEMON WATER. To prepare this delightful drink, 3 
pieces of lemon thinly pared into a closely covered vessel or teapot, 
with a very small piece of the rind, and a large spoonful of spiced 
syrup, put in a pint of boiling water, and let it be stopped closely 
for 2 hours. 

RASPBERRY VINEGAR AND WATER. No draught is more agreea- 
ble to a feverish patient than a dessert spoonful of raspberry vine- 
gar mixed in a tumblerful of cold water. It should never stand in 
any metal or glazed vessel, for the acid would act upon their surfaces 
to an injurious extent. 

CALIFORNIA SODA WATER. Dissolve a small teaspoon ful of "car- 
bonate of soda in a large glass containing a wine glass full of water. 
Squeeze into it a large lemon or orange, and drink it off while it 
hisses ; if fresh fruit cannot be had, obtain from the druggist citric 
or tartaric acid, which answer the purpose Dissolve in another 
glass 1-2 teaspoonful of either of these acids, pour into the soda 
and drink off instantly. It is a very proper drink in the measles, 
but the quantity must be reduced according to the age of the child. 

TOAST WATER. Toast very brown on both sides thin slices of 
wheat bread, but do not let them burn. Put the toast in a pitcher 
that has holes at the spout through which to strain it (if you have 
one) and pour boiling water over it as much as you need. Cover 
the pitcher and let it stand to cool, then pour it off into a bottle. 
Made in this way toast water is very wholesome and refreshing, even 
at table by persons in health as well as invalids. 

PLEASANT DRINK IN HOT WEATHER. Take 2 Ib. of white sugar, 
and the juice of 1-2 lemon, 2 oz. tartaric acid, 3 pints of water; 
boil together five minutes ; when cold, add the whites of 3 eggs, well 
beaten, with 1-2 cup of flour, and 1-2 oz. of wintergreen; bottle and 
keep in a cool place. Take 2 tablespoonfuls of this syiup for a 
tumbler of water, and 1-4 teaspoonful of soda. 

OXYRNKL SIMPLE. (Dr. M.) 2 Ibs. clear honey, 2 pints vinegar, 
pour into a glass vessel or wide-mouthed bottle, set in a vessel of 
cold water, heat gently and simmer till as thick as syrup. When 
used add a teaspoonful to a glass of water. 

A NICE DRINK May be formed of it with the addition of a little 
sugar, grated nutmeg and enough of the "plain mass" and water to 
suit the taste. NOTE. This delicious preparation could be made 
in this slope, where fruits of the plain kind are so superior and so 
abundant. Every housekeeper should have it. I found it useful in 
traveling. 

FOR SUMMER DRINK. i Ib. of red currants, bruised with some 
raspberries, (or 1-2 the quantity dried a la Alden, and softened in a 
very little cold water) 1-2 Ib. of sugar added to i gallon of cold 



412 REFRESHING DRINKS. 

water siirred well and allowed to settle, the juice of a lerrfon. Mul- 
berry the same, adding a little lemon peel. 

FIGS AND APPLE BEVERAGE. Have 2 quarts of water boiling, in- 
to which throw 6 dry figs previously opened, and 2 apples cut into 6 
or 8 slices each ; let the whole boil together 20 minutes, then pour 
them into a basin to cool ; pass through a seive, drain the fig-a, which 
will be good to eat with a little sugar. 

CURRANT DRINK. To i pint of fresh gathered and picked cur- 
rants add i pint of water; let them boil together 10 or 15 minutes, 
then strain and sweeten to taste ; add a few raspberries to increase 
the pleasant flavor. The same may be produced in winter by sim- 
mering 2 tablespoonfuls of currant jelly in 1-2 pint of water. 

IMPERIAL DRINK. 1-4 Ib. lump sugar, 3 oz. orange or lemon 
peel; juice of i lemon, 1-2 oz. cream tartar, 3 pints of boiling 
water. Mix all together, cover the vessel till cold, then pour off the 
clear portion for use. An agreeable drink for hot weather or in 
fever. 

A VERY AGREEABLE DRINK. Pour a tablespoonful of good cider 
vinegar into a tumbler of fresh cool water, and sweeten with sugar, 
molasses or syrup to taste, add a rasp or two of nutmeg. Tama- 
rinds, fresh currants or in jelly, or scalded cranberries, make excel- 
lent drinks. Use sugar or not, as may be agreeable. 

IN MAKING any cooling beverage for summer use, the proportions 
need not be adhered to, but increased or diminished to suit the 
taste. Acidulated drinks are very agreeable, and invaluable in re- 
lieving thirst, and most useful for their anti-bilious and anti-scorbutic 
properties. 

LEMONADK. Suitable to the quantity of liquor wanted, pare as 
thin as possible any number of lemons, then with lumps of refined 
sugar rub the surface, to extract the flavor; put the saturated sugar 
into a basin and squeeze the lemons over it. Add the best refined 
sugar to taste. In proportions as desired, hot water and a little 
boiling milk may be added; 3 quarts to 2 dozen lemons will do, 
using half the rind, but the whole of the juice. When well mixed 
skim the liquor and run it through a linen bag, previously wet in hot 
water. 

BARLEY LEMONADE. Put a half pint of water into a small pan, 
then into the water put 4 oz. of sugar, boil into a thickish syrup, or 
ten minutes, then add the juice of two lemons or one Sicily lime, 
with a fresh rind of one lemon, then boil a moment longer, then add 
one-half gallon of barley water, with sugar or flavoring. Boil five 
minutes longer, then strain into a pitcher, and cover over with a 
folded paper with a hole in the middle for the steam to pass through. 
Let cool, then drink it. N. B. If bottled closely, it will be good 
for several days. 



REFRESHING DRINKS. 413 

PORTABLE LEMONADE, CONVENIENT ON VOYAGES AND TRAVELING 
IN THE COUNTRY. Take 3 oz. of refined sugar; tartaric acid 1-2 oz., 
essence of lemon i dram. Pound the sugar and tartaric acid well 
in a smooth mortar, gradually pouring in the essence upon the mix- 
ture. Mix the whole very well and divide it off for use and put in 
12 separate parcels; take one, when needed, and mix with a tumbler 
of water; it will make a pleasant and refreshing drink. 

LEMONADE OR ORANGEADE. Squeeze the juice, pour boiling wa- 
ter on a little of the peel and cover close. Boil water and sugar to 
a thin syrup and strain it. When all are cold, mix the juice, the in- 
fusion, and the syrup with as much river water as will make a rich 
sherbet, strain through a flannel or linen bag, or squeeze the juice 
and strain it. 

MOCK LEMONADE A SUBSTITUTE. 1-2 Ib. sugar, tartaric acid 1-2 
oz., four or five drops on the sugar; boiling water 3 pints. Let it 
get cold and bottle tightly. It is a wholesome, cooling summer 
drink. 

ORGEAT. Boil a quart of new milk with a stick of cinnamon, 
sweeten to taste and let it grow cold ; then pour in it by degrees 3 
oz. of sweet almonds, and 20 of bitter, that have been blanched 
and beaten to a paste, with a little water to prevent oiling ; boil all 
together, and stir till cold, then add 1-2 glass of brandy. 

ORANGE OR LEMON DRINKS. Squeeze the juice of 4 oranges or 
lemons, rinse the pulp and rind in boiling water, simmer another 1-2 
pint of water, with 10 lumps of sugar till thoroughly dissolved and 
mixed ; when all are cold mix them all together, strain through flan- 
nel or muslin. 

ORANGEADE AND ARROW ROOT. Make this drink as you would 
lemonade, taking the whole of an orange, with a little of the peel, 
sweetening to taste with sugar candy, adding a thickening made of 
one teaspoonful of arrowroot stirred in a little cold water, and poured 
into the boiling water, when you put in the juice of the orange. 
The arrowroot is a great improvement. 

ORANGEADE FOR INVALIDS. Make it as lemonade, using the whole 
of an orange, with the small piece of the rind, sweeten with loaf 
sugar, then stir a teaspoonful of arrowroot in a little cold water, then 
pour it into the boiling water at the same time you add the orange. 
The arrowroot is a great improvement. 

COOLING LEMONADE. Split 2 moist dried figs in two, then drop 
them into 2 pints of water boiling in a sauce pan, boil for fifteen 
minutes, then take the peel of a lemon, with half the lemon cut in 
thin slices, put into the pan and boil a minute or two longer, then 
pour all into a pitcher and cover it closely till cool, then strain it and 
add a small spoonful of honey, and it is ready to serve.

LEMONADE. The juice of lemon 4 oz., lemon peel one-half oz., 
white sugar 4 oz., boiling water three pints; let stand till cold, then 
strain, a little sweet spirits of nitre may be added ; diluted if wished. 
Suit the taste of the* patient. Excellent drink for the kidneys. 

LEMONADE, ITALIAN. Pare and press 2 dozen lemons, pour the 
juice on the peels and let it remain on them all night; in the morning 
add 2 Ib. of loaf sugar, i quart of good sherry, and 3 quarts of 
boiling water. Mix well, add a quart of boiling milk, and strain

SOUR SOP. A West Indian fruit of a tree of the same as the cus- 
tard apple, which grows in the West Indies. It is a large fruit, often 
weighing 2 or 3 Ibs., the pulp of which is white and succulent, sweet 
with an agreeable acidity. It is pleasant and refreshing, and a drink 
of the pulp cut up in ice water is as refreshing, as delicious, and 
equal if not superior to lemonade. 

FLAX SEED TEA. Boil 2 tablespoonfuls of flax seeds in 3 pints of 
water till reduced to i pint, then strain off. It may be sweetened 
with honey or liquorice, and made acid with vinegar or squeezing 
into it a little lemon juice. It is best to tie the seeds up in a bag, 
put it into a teapot, add boiling water, let it steep by a fire or on a 
stove for a while and then set it away to cool. 

VARIOUS SORTS OF TEA. Tea made of balm, mint, sage or cow- 
slip is often found refreshing. Balm tea is most cooling, mint the 
most soothing to the bowels, sage or marigold the most reviving. 
and cowslip has rather a composing tendency. To have them nice, 
they should be made of fresh herbs and often. 

DR. HUFFLANU'S DRINK FOR FKVKB PATIENTS, OR EXCESSIVE 
THIRST. Boil till dissolved in 3 quarts of water, 1-2 oz. of cream of 
tartar. Remove from the fire, then add a sour orange sliced, adding 
from i 1-2 to 3 oz. of white sugar, according to the taste of the pa- 
tient ; bottle closely and keep in a cool dry place. It is a most 
healthful drink. 

DRINK FOR FEVER. Boil 3 oz. of currants and 2 oz. of raisins, 
carefully stoned, and i 1-2 oz. of tamarinds in 3 pints of water till it 
is reduced to a quart; strain it, add a piece of lemon peel and let it 
stand for an hour, when it is fit for use.

oz. cranberries, i 1-2 oz. of tamarinds, in 3 pints of water till re- 
duced to 2 pints. Strain and add a piece of fresh lemon peel and 
let it remain for 30 minutes then take it out. 

FEVER DRAUGHT. Put into a jar a few sprigs of balm, fennel and 
sage cleanly washed. Slice the pulp of a lemon, grate in a little of 
the peel, pour over it 3 pints of boiling water, and cork it tight for 
use. 



REFRESHING DRINKS. 4! 5 

AN AGREEABLE EGYPTIAN DRINK. Made of tamarinds, honey and 
water, proportioned to taste. Good (when much diluted with water) 
in fevers. 

DRINK. Grecian. Made by expressing the juice of the toma- 
toes, honey and a small portion of lime or lemon juice; some water 
or pure vinegar ; mix ; wholesome. Proportioned as desired. 

LIME WATER. Make the lime water according to the directions 
given, then mix with a decoction of peruvian barks. A most valua- 
ble tonic, frees the bowels from morbid matter, corrects acids, aids 
digestion, strengthens the system; good for hindering affections ofall 
kinds, scrofula and the whites and worms ofall kinds. 

NOURISHING DRINK FOR FEVER PATIENTS. Three or 4 teaspoons 
(even) of arrow-root made into a thin paste with cold water, then 
pour into a quart vessel, then add the juice of 1-2 lime or lemon. 
Stir in 2 or 3 tablespoonfuls of white sugar, then pour over boiling 
water to fill the bowl, stirring all the time. Keep covered and let 
the patient drink freely. 

HIGH BLACKBERRYROOT TEA OR CoRDiAL.Aunt Nancy Patterson, 
(colored.) Make a strong decoction of the root of the tall blackber- 
ry and loaf sugar, and boil down to a thick syrup or cordial, then 
strain. Dose: a small wineglassful 3 times a day, putting 1-8 of 
spirits to keep it. This is valuable for obstinate diarrhea or dys- 
entery and typhoid fever, commencing at first with only a teaspoon- 
ful or more. 

DRINK FOR AN INVALID. A new laid egg well beaten; a cup of 
hot coffee or chocolate poured to it, stirring it well, is a good drink. 

BUTTERMILK. If made of sweet cream, is a delicious and 
most wholesome food. Those who can relish sour buttermilk 
find it still more light. Buttermilk, if not very sour, is also as good 
as cream to eat with fruit sweetened with white sugar and mixed 
with a very little milk. It likewise does equally well for cakes and 
rice puddings, and of course it is economical to churn before the 
cream is too stale, otherwise it is not- fit for anything but to feed 
pigs. 

DR. BOCEHAAVE'S SWEET BUTTERMILK. Turn the milk of i cow 
into a small churn, in about 10 minutes begin churning, and continue 
till the flakes of the butter swim aboutthickand the discharged milk 
appears thin and blue. Strain it through a sieve and drink it as 
frequently as possible. It is good for consumptive cases, but in 
order to its producing decidedly good effects should be the only 
drink of the patient, and the food taken with it should be biscuits, 
rusks, and ripe and dried fruits, of various kinds, when a decline is 
apprehended. Baked and dried fruits, raisins in particular, make an 
excellent supper for invalids with biscuits or common cake. 



416 REFRESHING DRINKS. 

BUTTERMILK, ITS PROPERTIES. Cooly. If the butter be prepared 
from sweet cream, the buttermilk left from the operation is not only 
very delicious, but exceedingly wholesome and nutritious. 

CARACOA. Take i pint of brandy and put into it the rind of 6 
oranges pared as thin as possible. Let this stand for 3 days, stirring 
it very often, then add the juice of the oranges, and 2 quarts of 
brandy, 5 Ibs. of loaf sugar powdered, and i Ib, of sugar candy 
powdered; stir it well for 1-2 hour and let it remain 2 days longer, 
stirring it during the time. Then strain and bottle it. It should not 
be opened for six months the longer it is kept, the better. 

To MAKE A SHERRY COBLER. Reduce the ice into snowflakes by 
means of an ice-plane, or pound a quantity of ice quite fine in a 
coarse cloth by beating it with a mallet, half fill a large tumbler with 
this pounded ice, add one or two teaspoonfuls of powdered sugar, 
the rind of 1-2 lemon and one or two glasses of sherry. Stir them 
well together and drink through a small tube or straw. 

CHERRY BOUNCE. Mrs. M. E. Upshur. Fill your jug with cher- 
ries, (the May Duke are the best) sweeten your rum to taste; allow i 
Ib. of sugar to i gal. rum; pour into the jug, or stone pot, the rum, 
and let it remain two months on the fruit, then pour it off and bot- 
tle it. 

PEACH SPONGAGE. Proportions: 5 gills of syrup at 38 degrees, 
5 gills of pared raw peaches, 2 tablespoonfuls of maraschino and i 
gill of whites of eggs whipped. Place the peaches in a basin, dilute 
them with the white of eggs and the syrup, pass the preparation 
through a tammy, let freeze. Last of all, introduce into it the ma- 
rachino, mixed with a little syrup by degrees only. 

MEDICATED OR SPICED WINE. In a mortar beat separately 1-4 
ounce each of cinnamon, 12 blades of mace, 2 nutmegs and a tea- 
spoonful of coriander seeds. Mix them together and put them into 
a jar containing a quart of the best port wine. Add the rind and 
the juice of 4 large California lemons, mixed with 1-2 Ib. of pow- 
dered loaf sugar. Cover the vessel closely, and let it steep a week 
or more, then strain the liquid through a linen bag and bottle it. 

CALIFORNIA SPICED WINE. Infuse for a few hours in about 3 
quarts of white wine i 1-2 Ib. of loaf sugar, i oz. cinnamon, 3 or 4 
drops of sweet marjoram or sage, and a little white pepper, all beaten 
in a mortar. Run the liquor through a' filtering bag and add the 
juice of a large, ripe and juicy lemon; warm it moderately over the 
fire, pour it again on the spices, and when it has stood 3 or 4 days, 
strain off and bottle for use. If wanted to be red, port wine may 
be used, or the liquor colored with the juice of cider, or mulberries, 
cochineal, &c. 

COMMON PUNCH. Take a teaspoonful of the acid salt of lemons, 



REFRESHING DRINKS. 417 

1-4 lb. of sugar, i quart of boiling water, 1-2 pint of brandy and a 
small piece of lemon peel if agreeable, or a very little of the essence 
of lemon. 

PUNCH A LA ROMAINE. i quart of clearest spring water, 5 Ibs. of 
the best lump sugar, the juice of 8 oranges and 6 lemons ; put all 
together into a stew pan and simmer till well clarified ; when cold, 
put into an ice pail, and when well frozen add the whole of 6 new 
laid eggs, whisked to a froth. Beat the whole well together, and 
just before it is served, add four teaspoonfuls of the best Jamaica 
rum. This will make a sufficient quantity for ten persons. The 
juice of the oranges and lemons should be strained through a fine 
seive. It is an improvement if the beaten eggs are added before it 
is iced. 

EGG NOG To make a gallon of egg nog, take i dozen eggs, break 
them and beat the whites and yolks separately ; after the yolks have 
been beaten fifteen minutes, put 12 tablespoonfuls of fine white 
sugar in them and beat or whisk them until they rise and are thick. 
The great secret of having it nice is to beat or whisk the yolks thick, 
whip the whites to a stiff froth; 1-2 pint of brandy in the yolks, and 
when well mixed, stir the whites slowly in. Have milk in a glass 
pitcher to be added if preferred. 

EGG WINE. Mix with a spoonful of cold water a beaten egg; set 
on the fire, in a pan, i glass of white wine, 1-2 glass of water, sugar 
and nutmeg to taste. When it boils, pour a little of it on the egg 
by degrees till the whole is in, stirring it well, then return the whole 
into the stew pan, put it on a gentle fire, stir it one way for not more 
than a minute, for if it boil or the egg be stale it will curdle. Serve 
with toast. Egg wine may be made as above, without warming the 
egg, and it is then lighter on the stomach, though not so pleasant to 
the taste. 

LEMON WINE OR CITRON WATER. Take the parings of 12 large, 
thick rinded lemons when in full perfection ; that is, when not over 
ripe, cut very thin and put them into 2 quarts of brandy (and in 
that proportion for any quantity), and add i quart of good spring 
water and 6 or 8 ounces of fine loaf sugar, then put into it i gill 
of boiled skimmed milk, which will cause it to curdle immedi- 
ately. Stir it well and cover it up close, and at the end of 3 or 
4 days you will find a beautiful lemon-colored transparent liquor, 
which must be carefully poured from the sediment or drawn off 
by a crane and then bottled. It is good and fit to drink at once, 
but much better if kept for some time. It can be diluted with 
water. 

NOTE It is nice to drink as a cordial. Mixed with water it is 
like lemonade, and to put in artificial wine to give them an agreea- 
ble flavor.

REFRESHING DRINKS. 

ORANGE WINE. This delightful beverage is prepared in the fol- 
lowing manner : Take 1 2 oranges and pare them very thin; strain 
the juice so that none of the seeds go in with it, then take 6 pounds 
of loaf sugar and the whites of 2 eggs well beaten, put these into 3 
gallons of clear water and let it boil gently for 1-2 hour; as the 
scum rises take it off, then add the orange juice and rind ; add 3 or 
4 spoonfuls of good yeast and let it stand for 3 or 4 days, then draw 
it off and add i quart of rectified spirits and bottle. The corks 
should be secured by wire or twine in the bottle. 

PEACH LIQUEUR OR WINE. Take of the best kind of ripe, juicy 
free-stone peaches (8 pounds), mash them and put them into 
2 gallons of soft, clear water ; add 5 pounds of broken loaf sugar. 
Crack the stones and take the kernels, crack and lay them at 
at the bottom of the vessel, which should be clean and dry. With 
the dissolved sugar put the peaches into a preserving kettle, boil 
and skim until the scum ceases to rise, then strain through a large 
sieve into the tub that has the kernels in the bottom ; mix well and 
cover closely till cool. Then add a piece of toasted bread and cover 
the whole with good, fresh yeast. Let it work, and when it ceases 
hissing strain through a linen bag into a keg. Then add a bottle of 
sweet Malaga wine. At the end of 6 months draw offa little to see if 
it is clear; if not, take out a pint of the wine, mix with an ounce of 
powdered gum arabic, let it dissolve gently over a slow fire and add 
to it i ounce of pounded chalk. When dissolved, put the pint of 
wine back in the keg ; stir it in lightly with a clean stick ; take care 
not to let the stick touch the bottom, as that would stir up the sedi- 
ment. Let it stand for 3 days, then pour off and bottle tightly. In 
6 months it will be fit for use. 

BALM WINE. Boil gently for 2 hours 40 pounds of white sugar 
in 9 gallons of water; stir it well and pour it in a vessel to cool; take 
2 1-2 pounds of balm leaves, wash them well, then bruise them and 
put them in a barrel; stirring it well together, and let it stand for . 
24 hours, stirring it often, then close it up and let it stand for 6 
weeks, then rack it off into bottles, putting a lump of loaf sugar 
into each bottle and cork closely. It will be better to keep it a year 
or longer. 

COW-SLIP WINE. To every gallon of water allow 3 Ibs. of lump 
sugar, the rind of i California lemon and the juice of 2, the rind 
and juice of i large California orange, i gallon of cow-slip pips. 
To every 4 1-2 gallons of wine allow i bottle of brandy; boil the 
water and sugar together for 1-2 hour, carefully removing the scum 
as it rises ; pour this boiling liquor on the orange and lemon rinds 
and the juice, which should be strained when lukewarm: add the 
cow-slip pips or flowers picked from the stalks and seeds, and to 9 



REFRESHING DRINKS. 

gallons of wine 3 tablespoonfuls of good fresh brewer's yeast ; let 
it ferment 3 or 4 days, then put all together in a cask with the 
brandy, and let it remain for 2 months, when bottle it off for use. 

HOT PUNCH. 1-2 pint of rum, 1-2 pint of brandy, 1-4 lb. of 
sugar, i large lemon, 1-2 teaspoonful pounded nutmeg, i pint boil- 
ing water; rub the sugar over the rind of the lemon until it has ab- 
sorbed all the yellow part, then put the sugar into a punch bowl, 
add the lemon juice (free from pulp), and mix these two ingredients 
together well ; pour over them the boiling water, stir well together, 
add the rum, brandy and nutmeg; mix thoroughly and the punch 
will be ready to serve. It is very important in making good punch 
that all the ingredients are thoroughly incorporated, and to insure 
success, the process of mixing must be diligently attended to. 

SAN FRANCISCO PUNCH. Pare six California lemons, 3 oranges 
(large, full and ripe) very thin. Squeeze the juice into a large tea- 
pot, put to it 2 quarts of brandy, i quart of white wine, i of milk, 
and i 1-4 Ibs. of sugar. Let it be mixed, and then covered for 24 
hours; strain through a flannel bag till clear, then bottle it. 

PUNCH. Take 2 large, ripe, juicy, rough-skinned lemons and some 
large lumps of double refined sugar. Rub the sugar over the lemons 
till it has absorbed all the yellow part of the skin. Then put into 
the bowl these lumps and as much more as the juice of the lemon 
as you may suppose it requires, for no certain weight can be men- 
tioned, as the acidity of a lemon cannot be known till tried, and 
therefore this must be determined by the taste. Then squeeze the 
lemon juice upon the sugar and with a squeezer press the sug.ir and 
the juice particularly well together, for a great deal of the richness 
and fine flavor of the punch depends on this rubbing and mixing 
process being thoroughly performed. Then mix this up very well 
with boiling water (soft water preferred) till the whole is rather cool. 
When this mixture, which is now called sherbet, is to your taste, take 
equal quantities of brandy and rum and put them to it, mixing the 
whole well together again. The quantity of liquor must be accord- 
ing to your taste. 2 good lemons are generally enough to make 4 
pints. 

AROMATIC TINCTURE. Take i oz. of bruised ginger, i oz. of 
bruised cinnamon, i oz. seeds of the lesser cardamon, 2 drams of 
black pepper, and i quart of spirits. Let these steep for 15 days, 
Keep it in a warm place and strain for use. 2 or 3 teaspoonfuls may 
be taken in a little sugared water, or in wine with or without a little 
water. This tincture is a cordial, and, in cases of indigestion and 
longer, is considered a restorative. 

NEGUS. A pleasant drink, called after Col. Negus, the inventor. 
To every pint of port wine allow i quart of boiling water, 1-4 lb. of

sugar, i lemon and grated nutmeg to taste. This beverage is more 
usually drank at children's parties than at any other; the wine need 
not be very old or expensive for the purpose, a new, fruity wine an- 
swering very well for it. Add the sugar and lemon juice with the 
grated nutmeg, pour it over the boiling water, cover the jug, and, 
when the beverage has cooled a little, it will be fit for use. Negus 
may also be made of sherry or any other sweet white wine, but it is 
more usually made of port wine than any other beverage. One pint 
of wine with the other ingredients in proportion, will be enough fora 
party of 9 or 10 children. 

BUTTERED TODDY. Is strong rum and water, sweetened with 
honey, enriched with a lump of fresh butter, and flavored with nut- 
meg and lemon juice. It is much in favor with naval gentlemen. 

EGG FLIP. Keep grated ginger and nutmeg, with a little fine 
dried lemon peel, rubbed together in a mortar. To make a quart of 
flip, put the ale on the fire to warm and beat up 3 or 4 oz. of moist 
sugar, a teaspoonful of grated nutmeg or ginger and a quartern of 
good old rum or brandy. When the egg is near to boil, put it into 
one pitcher, and the rum and eggs, etc., into another. Turn it from 
one pitcher to another till it is as smooth as cream. 

BUTTERMILK ITS GREAT VALUE. It will cure one without crav- 
ings for stimulants, if persisted in its use, When the appetite calls 
for any kind of spirits drink a tumbler of buttermilk and the stom- 
ach will be satisfied and at the same time both benefited and strength- 
ened, and the desire for drink weakened. It will effectually cure a 
sour stomach. It supplies more largely than any other drink or 
food known, the lactic acid which is needed by many persons. It 
is the prevention of valvular ossifications of the valves of the heart, 
of which so many persons die in this country, especially old persons. 
It prevents the so-called flutterings and palpitations of the heart, 
dyspeptic stomachs, unpleasant feelings all of which have their seat 
in the stomach, melancholy, the blues, &c., and which the lactic 
acid prevents, if buttermilk is drank often and freely.

BLACKBERRY WINE. (S. C.) Allow 4 Ibs. of blackberries to i gal. 
of water, stir frequently and let the mixture stand for 72 hours, or 3 
days, then strain through a sieve and to each gallon of the liquor put 
3 Ibs. of sugar. Let it stand 3 more days, stirring and skimming 
often, then put it into a cask and leave the bunghole open for 14 days. 
To every 9 gallons put i quart of the best brandy and fasten down 
the bung. If it does not clear, stir in a solution of isinglass. Cur- 
rant, raspberry and sherry wines may also be made from this recipe.

GEORGIA BLACKBERRY WINE. Measure the berries and bruise 
them. For every gallon allow i quart of boiling water. Let the 
mixture stand 24 hours, stirring occasionally, then strain off the 
liquor into a cask. For every gallon add 2 Ibs. of sugar ; cork tight 
and let it stand till the following October. 

A GEORGIA RECIPE, which has succeeded well in California for the 
making of blackberry, raspberry, strawberry and rhubarb wines, and 
which I obtained from a gentleman who has succeeded well in that 
business. To i gallon of water add 3 Ibs. of the berries, mash them 
with the hand, let them stand 3 days, press out, and to every gallon 
of juice add 3 pounds of common brown sugar. Place in a cask to 
ferment, after which bung tightly. 

BLACKBERRY WINE. (Mrs. Jennie Steele, Cotton Gin, Texas.) To 
3 gallons of juice add i gallon of water, 3 Ibs. of sugar to the gallon, 
mash the berries and let them stand 24 hours, then squeeze out the 
juice through a flannel bag, then add the water to the juice and also 
the sugar. 

BLACKBERRY WINE. To i gallon of juice pressed from the fruit, 
add 3 pounds of loaf sugar and i pint of water, let it ferment in a jug 
or cask, then pour off, bottle and seal. In 6 months it will be fit for 
use. 

BLACKBERRY WINE. (D. C.) Allow to every gallon of mashed 
berries i quart of boiling water, let it stand a day and night, then 
strain and add 3 pounds of loaf sugar to every gallon of juice. Let 
it stand 3 or 4 weeks with the bung laid on loosely, till it is done 
fermenting, then stop it tightly and set it away for some months ; 
then bottle it closely. 

GOOSEBERRY WINE. Take 4 1-2 gallons of water and 5 gallons of 
gooseberries. Mix 6 Ibs. of sugar, 4 Ibs. of honey, i oz. of white 
tartar, i oz. of dry orange and lemon peel, or 2 oz. of fresh peel ; 
add 1-2 gallon of light brandy, and you have 9 gallons of nice wine. 
Currant wine may be made in the same way. It is good in 6 months. 

GOOSEBERRY WINE IN IMITATION OF CHAMPAGNE, To every 3 Ibs. 
of ripe gooseberries put a pint of clear spring water, first bruise your 
fruit with your hands in a tub and then put the water to them, stir 
them very well and let them stand a whole day, then strain them off, 
and to every pound of gooseberries put a pint of water, and a pound 
of dissolved sugar and let it stand for 24 hours more, then skim off 
the froth and put the liquor into a clean vessel and the scum into a 
flannel bag, and what drains from it, into the vessel ; let it work 2 or 
3 days before you stop it up, and if it be not clear when you draw 
into bottles, let it stand in the bottles for some time, then draw it off 
into other bottles. Do not tap it too low when drawn from the 
casks. Experience and fancy may suggest other advantages and 
varieties in the way of making gooseberry wines.

WINE, TO COOL WITHOUT ICE. Dip a piere of linen into water 
and wrap it around the bottle, and place it in a draught. 

GREEN CURRANT WINE. Strip from the stems full green ci.rr.u!ts 
before they begin to turn, weigh them and allow i gallon of soft 
water to 3 Ibs. of the fruit ; mash and treat them as in the re- 
cipe for effervescing gooseberry wine. Use instead of loaf sugar, light 
colored brown sugar. Let the juice or wine remain in the cask, and 
as soon as the fermentation ceases, -bung the cask tightly, and in 6 
months it will be fit for use. 

CHERRY WINE. Take not over ripe Marillo cherries picked off 
from their stems, mash them in a mortar or vessel to remove the 
pulp without bruising the stones, and suffer the mass to stand 24 
hours ; strain through a coarse hair sieve and to every 3 gallons add 
8 or 9 pounds of lump sugar, put the mixture in a cask and suffer it 
to ferment, and pour the wine from its lees as soon as i: becomes 
clear. Some manufacturers crack the stones and put them with the 
kernels in muslin bags in the casks during the fermentation of the 
wine, which gives it a nutty flavor. 

WINE MADE FROM MIXED FRUITS. (From an English paper.) Take 
cherries, black currants, white currants and raspberries, of each an 
equal quantity, though if the black currants predominate, the better. 
To 4 Ibs. of the mixed fruit, well bruised, put i gal. of water, let it 
steep 3 days and nights in an open vessel, frequently stirring up the 
mass; then strain it through a hair sieve. The remaining pulp press 
to dryness, pour both liquids together, and in each gal. of the liquid 
put 3 pounds of sugar ; let the whole stand 3 days and night, fre- 
quently stirring it up as before, skimming the top; then turn it into a 
cask and let it remain open at the bung hole whilst fermenting about 
2 weeks; lastly, to every 9 gals, put i quart of good brandy, and then 
fasten down the bung; if it does not soon become fine, a solution of 
isinglass may be stirred into the wine. 

STRAWBERRY WINE. Ten gallons of strawberries, 10 gallons of 
water, 25 Ibs. of sugar, 3 oz. of red tartar, 2 lemons, oranges, peel 
and juice, i gallon of brandy. This is delicious and keeps well. 

RASPBERRY WINE. To 10 quarts of mashed raspberries add 8 
quarts of water and let the mixture stand 24 hours ; strain the mass 
through a coarse hair sieve and add to every gal. 2 or 3 Ibs. of lump 
sugar and suffer it to ferment. Then bottle closely. 

APRICOT WINE. Take 'apricots when nearly ripe, remove the 
stones, and bruise the pulp in a mortar. To 8 Ibs. of the pulp add 
a quart of water, suffer the mixture to stand for 24 hours, then 
squeeze out the juice ; add to every gallon of it 2 Ibs. of loaf sugar, 
put it into a cask and suffer it to ferment, when perfectly clear, bot- 
tle it.

MUSCADINE WINE. Get the grapes when fully ripe, wash, drain 
and pound them with a pestle, not breaking the seeds, as they would 
make the wine bitter. After pounding them, measure and allow to 
every gallon of the beaten fruit i gallon of soft water; after standing 
a week, strain and measure the clear juice and add 3 Ibs. of loaf 
sugar to each gallon. After fermentation ceases, bottle it tightly. 
The drink is grateful and highly refreshing in warm weather. 

CRANBERRY WINE. Deemed a remedy for scrofula. After crush- 
ing the berries well, put them into a stone jar and allow 2 quarts of 
berries to i quart of water. Stir well and let it stand 2 days ; strain 
through a double flannel bag, then mash a second supply of berries 
equal in quantity to the first and cover with this liquid. Steep 48 
hours longer ; strain and allow i pound of sugar for 3 quarts of 
liquor and boil 5 minutes. Set to ferment in lightly covered jars, 
then pour off and bottle. 

FRENCH CURRANT WINE. Dissolve 8 pounds of honey in 15 gal- 
lons of boiling water, to which, when clarified, add the juice of 8 
pounds of red or white currants ; then ferment for 24 hours ; to every 
2 gallons add 2 pounds of sugar and clarify with whites of eggs. 

CORINTHIAN OR CURRANT WINE. Mrs. Weston. Good for dys- 
peptics Gather the seedless grape or Zante currants, lay the bunches 
one over the other in the sun to dry, then take them to the press- 
room and lay them in heaps for some days ; throw on them 1-3 of their 
bulk of water, then trample with the feet to a pulp or paste, then 
put them through the press. The juice is thick and dark ; when it 
settles it becomes clear. Malaga, California and other raisins and 
elderberries may be used in the same way. 

CURRANT WINE. Take your currants full ripe, pick and bruise 
them in a mortar, and to every gallon of pulp put 2 quarts of water 
first boiled and cold ; you can, if you choose, add some grapes ; 
let it stand in a tub to ferment, and then run it through a hair sieve. 
Let no one touch it, but let it take its time to run, and to every gal- 
lon of this liquor put 2 1-2 pounds of white sugar. Stir it well and 
put it in your vessel, and to every gallon put a quart of the best 
rectified spirits of wine, and let it stand 6 weeks and bottle and cork 
tightly. 

HONEY WINE (Californian.) Honey, 20 pounds; cider, 12 gal- 
lons; ferment, then add 1-2 gallon of rum, the same of brandy, red 
or white tartar (dissolved) 6 ounces, bitter almonds and cloves of 
each, 1-4 ounce. This is also called mead wine. 

CLAIRET. i oz. each of fennel seed, coriander seed, linseed, chill 
seed, caraway seed, nutmeg plant seeds (garden), nutmeg geranium 
seeds ; bruise them in a clean marble mortar, then for one week let 
them steep in 2 quarts of proof spirits, strain and add i Ib.or more 
of the best loaf sugar.

EXCELLENT CALIFORNIA RAISIN WINE. Put 8 gallons of fresh 
California raisins to every gal. of water in a large tub. Stir thor- 
oughly every day for a month, then press the raisins in a flannel bag, 
as dry as possible; put the liquor into a cask; when it is done hissing 
pour in a bottle of the best brandy: stop it close for 12 months, then 
pour it off leaving the dregs, filter through paper pulp in a flannel 
bag, add the clear to the quantity, and pour i or 2 quarts of brandy, 
according to the size of the vessel or cask. Raisin wine would be 
extremely good, if made with enough rich fruit and kept long. Age 
improves its flavor greatly. 

RAISIN WINE. Take 300 Ibs. of California raisins, not picked, put 
them into a hogshead of clear soft water, with i pound of hops, let 
the whole stand for 15 days, stirring twice a day. Then press it into 
a tub; then spread yeast over a piece of toasted bread, and let it 
ferment 24 hours, afterwards put the liquor into a cask, where it may 
work fourteen days longer; fill it up again as it works over, and when 
it has ceased, let it be well bunged. You may afterwards put 18 
gals, of water upon the raisins for small wine, in a week press it out, 
in a month bottle off. 

RAISIN WINE WITH CIDER. Put 200 Ibs. of California raisins into 
a cask and pour upon them a hogshead of good apple or pear cider 
that is not rough ; stir it well two or three days, stop it and let it 
stand for 6 months, then rack into a cask that it will fill, and pour in 
a gallon of the best brandy. If the raisin wine is used much, it 
would be best to keep a cask always for it and bottle off one year's 
wine just in time for the next, which, allowing the 6 month's infusion 
would make the wine 18 months old. In cider portions of country 
this is very economical and if not thought strong enough, the ad- 
dition of another quarter of a hundred pounds of raisins would be 
sufficient, and the wine would still be very cheap. When the raisins 
are pressed through a horse hair bag, they will either produce a good 
spirit by distillation and must be sent to a distiller, who will do it, 
but (for that purpose) they must be very little pressed, or they make 
an excellent vinegar. The stalk should be picked out, and may be 
thrown into any cask of vinegar that is making, being very acid. 

A RICH AND PLEASANT WINE. Take new cider from the press, 
mix it with as much honey as will support an egg, boil gently for 15 
minutes in an enamelled vessel or kettle and no other. Skim it well, 
when cool let it be put into a cask, but don't quite fill it. In six 
months bottle it. In 6 weeks it will be fit to drink ; it will be less 
sweet if kept longer in the cask. You will have a rich and strong 
wine and it will keep well. This will serve for culinary purposes. 
Honey is valuable to assist in rendering new crabbed austere cider 
nch palatable. The qualities of wines are greatly increased by age. 



WINES. 425 

SOUTH HAMPTON PORT. To British port add 1-2 pint of brandy 
and i dr. of powdered kino. 

BRITISH SHERRY. (C. P. B.) Grape or raisin wine slightly flavored 
with a very little bitter almond cake, or, what is more convenient, a 
little of the essential oil, dissolved in alcohol (essence of bitter al- 
monds). 2. To the last add a minute quantitity of sweet briar, eau 
de fleurs d'oranges, oroaris, to give it a slight bouquet. 3. To each 
gallon of strong raisin must, add, when racking, i Seville orange and 
2 bitter almonds, both sliced. By omitting the almonds and adding 
2 or 3 green citrons to each 10 gallons, this forms the British Ma- 
deira wine. 

CALIFORNIA GRAPE WINE. Mash the grapes to form a pulp with- 
out breaking the seeds, squeeze out the juice and strain it through a 
sieve ; pour over the husks or mash a small quantity of water, let it 
stand 24 hours and force out the adhering juice. Having done this, 
add to every gallon of the juice 3 Ibs. of lump sugar. Suffer the 
liquor to ferment and observe the rules pointed out for making goose- 
berry wines. 

CALIFORNIA TOKAY. Pick carefully from the stalks the finest and 
perfectly ripe California grapes, put them in a vessel and mash 
them with your hands ; pour the pulp and juice into a large hair 
sieve, placed over a large deep pan or clean tub ; press and squeeze 
out all the juice. To every quart of juice allow i pound of Califor- 
nia raisins, chopped small alter seeding them. Let the juice and 
raisins stand 12 days, stirring them several times a day; then strain 
the liquor through a flannel bag into a cask, but do not stop it closely 
for 3 or 4 days. In 8 months draw it off and bottle it. If it con- 
tains any sediment, pour out a pint of the wine and mix with it an 
ounce of powdered gum arabic, or 1-2 oz. of isinglass, shaved fine ; 
let it set in a warm place, and when dissolved, add in an ounce of 
powdered chalk. This will be enough to settle i barrel of wine. It 
should be lightly stirred to mix it with the rest. After standing 3 or 
4 days, then bottle and cork tightly. 

SCUPPERNONG WINE. Wash and mash scuppernong grapes and 
to every gallon add a pint of boiling water; next morning strain 
them through a coarse cloth and to every gallon of juice put 3 !bs. of 
crushed sugar. After it has well dissolved, put it in a demijohn, tie 
a cloth over the top and put it where it will not be disturbed for 6 
weeks; never let it be shaken. Bottle and cork as soon as the wine 
is ready ; in 5 weeks, if good, bottle it. This is a recipe for home- 
made scuppernong. On Roanoke Island, where the grape is in its 
native soil, it is made of the pure juice with a little burnt sugar to 
color it, and sometimes brandy is added by particular request. 
CLARET CUP. One bottle of claret, i bottle of soda water, 4 



426 WINBS. 

tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar, 1-4 teaspoonful of grated nutmeg, 
i liquor-glassful of sherry wine, 1-2 Ib. pounded ice, a sprig of green 
borage. Put all the ingredients into a glass or silver vessel, regulat- 
ing the proportion of the ice by the state of the weather; if very 
warm, a larger portion is necessary. Hand the cup around with a 
clean napkin passed through the handle, that the edge of the cup 
may be wiped after each guest has partaken of its contents; but it is 
best to have separate goblets or glasses. 

CHAMPAGNE WINE. Take good apple cider (crab apple prefer- 
red), 7 gals, i quart of the best 4th proof brandy, 5 quarts genuine 
champagne wine, i gill of new milk, 2 ozs. bitartarate of potassa ; 
mix and let stand for a short time; while fermenting, bottle. With 
age this makes an excellent imitation of champagne. 

CALIFORNIA SHERRY. Put i quart of water to every pound of 
moist sugar, boil it till clear ; when just milk warm, work with new 
yeast and add of strong beer, in the heighth of working, in the pro- 
portion of i quart to i gal. Cover it up and let it work the same as 
beer ; when it begins to rest, barrel it ; when it has been barreled 
a fortnight or 3 weeks, add raisins 1-2 Ib. to a gal., 1-2 oz. each to 
a gallon, of sugar candy, and to 9 gallons of wine. 1-2 pint of the 
best brandy. Paste a stiff brown paper over the bunghole ; this is 
preferable to a bung. After remaining in the cask i year it will be 
fit to bottle. It will improve if left longer ; if suffered to remain 3 
years in casks and i year in bottles, it can scarcely be distinguished 
from good imported wine. 

CHERRY BOUNCE. (Mrs. H's. Recipe.) Stone 1-2 the cherries, fill 
the vessel 1-2 full of the fruit, putting down a layer of fruit and a 
layer of brown sugar in the proportion of 1-4 pound of sugar to i 
quart of fruit. Fill the vessel with good apple or peach brandy, tie 
it up securely, let it remain until the cherries look a pale red, then 
strain and bottle it. Use it by adding water to taste, and more sugar 
if liked. This may be made in a jug or carboy. Should be covered 
or stopped, or the brandy will lose its strength. 

EFFERVESCING GOOSEBERRY WINE. To every gallon of water allow 
6 pounds of unripe gooseberries and 3 pounds of lump sugar. This 
wine should be prepared from green gooseberries, in order to avoid 
the flavor, which the fruit would give to the wine when in a mature 
state. Its briskness depends more upon the time of bottling than 
upon the unripe state of the fruit, for effervescing wine can be made 
from fruit that is ripe as well as from the unripe. The fruit should 
be selected when it has nearly attained its full growth, and conse- 
quently before it shows any tendency to ripen. Any bruised or de- 
cayed berries, and those which are very small should be refused. 
The blossom and stalk ends should be removed and the fruit well

bruised in a tub or vessel, in such quantities as to insure each berry 
being broken without crushing the seeds. Pour the water, which 
should be warm, over the fruit, squeeze and stir with the hand until 
all the pulp is removed from the skin and seeds, and cover the whole 
24 hours; after which strain through a coarse bag and press it with 
as much force as can conveniently be applied to extract the whole 
juice and liquor the fruit may contain. To every 40 or 50 pounds 
of fruit i gallon more of hot water may be passed through the husks, 
in order to obtain any soluable matter that may remain, and be again 
pressed. The fruit should be put in a tub or vessel of sufficient size 
to contain all of it, and the sugar added to it. Let it be well strred 
until the sugar is dissolved, and place the tub in a warm situation ; 
keep it closely covered and let it ferment for a day or two. It must 
be drawn off into clean casks, placed a little on one side for the 
scum that arises to be thrown out and the casks kept filled with the 
remaining "must" or unfermented juice that should be reserved 
for that purpose, When the active fermentation has ceased the 
casks should be plugged standing upright, and again be filled, if 
necessary, the bungs be put in loosely, and after a few days, when 
the fermentation is a little more languid, which may be known by 
the hissing noise ceasing, the bungs should be driven in tightly 
and a spile hole made to give vent if necessary. In five or six 
months the wine should be racked from its lees into clean casks, 
which may be rinsed with brandy. After a month it should be 
examined to see if sufficiently clear for bottling, if not, it should 
be purified with isinglass, which may be dissolved in some wine, 
i ounce will be sufficient for 2 gallons. The bottling should be done 
on a clear, warm day. 

DAMSON WINE. Gather dry the small damsons, which beat and 
crush with your hand, then put them into a vessel that has a 
mouth or hole in it for a faucet. To every 12 pounds of fruit add 
i 1-2 gallons of boiling water, which must be poured over the fruit 
scalding hot. After standing 48 hours draw it off into a clean cask, 
and to every gallon put 2 1-2 pounds of sugar. The cask should be 
quite full, and the longer it stands the better. After remaining 
some months, bottle it up, and into each bottle put a piece of loaf 
sugar. 

RHUBARB WINE. Grate the stalks on a coarse grater, strain the 
juice, and to each quart add 3 quarts of water and 3 Ibs. of brown 
sugar. Fill a demijohn to the brim with it, and keep some to fill it, 
as this works over. When it has done fermenting put a little isinglass 
in to clarify it, and bottle it. ' It will be good for use in 2 months, 
and the flavor will resemble champagne. 

GINGER WINE. Three gallons ot water, 3 pounds of sugar, 4 



428 WINES. 

ounces of race ginger washed in 4 waters; boil all well for one 
hour, strain it through a sieve into a cask with 3 lemons cut up 
and 2 gills of beer yeast ; shake it well and cover the cask lightly ; 
let it stand to ferment until clear enough to bottle. It will be fit 
to drink in 10 days after it is bottled, 

BASIL WINE (used to give a turtle taste to soups and gravies.) 
Steep 4 or 5 ounces of the green leaves of basil in i pint of 
sherry or cape, or raisin wine, strain and bottle closely. 

NOTE Wine of celery leaves, celery, leeks, sage, shalots and other 
green or dried herbs may be made in the same way. 

CAYENNE WINE. Steep i ounce of cayenne or capsicum or red 
pepper in i pint of grape wine for 2 weeks ; strain and bottle 
closely. 

NOTE In nearly the same way curry powder, spice and other 
similar wines for flavoring may be made for kitchen use, as black 
pepper and horseradish. 

API-LE WINE. Take fresh cider from the press, and to each gal- 
lon add 2 Ibs. of brown sugar; after dissolving the sugar, strain it 
and put it in a new cask (one that held brandy or whisky should not 
be used) ; tack a piece of muslin or perforated tin over the bung 
and let it stand for i week ; after this put in the cork tightly and let 
it remain 2 weeks longer; then fasten it tightly to exclude the air; 
leave 1-8 of the cask not filled. In 2 or 3 months it is fit for use; 
then draw off, bottle and seal. It is equal to Catawba wine. 
Rev. D. P. Young. 

CIDER WINE. Allow to each gallon of fresh cider just from the 
mill 2 Ibs. of brown sugar, stir until the sugar is thoroughly dissolved, 
then strain the mixture into a clean cask, but not full; let it remain 
unstopped for 48 hours, then put in the bung lightly until it ceases 
to effervesce, when bung up tightly. In a year the wine will be good. 
It will need no straining, for the longer it stands upon its lees the 
better it will be. 

MULBERRY WINE. Take and bruise in a tub, nearly ripe mulber- 
ries, and to every quart of the bruised berries, put a quart of water. 
Let the mixture stand 24 hours, strain it through a coarse hair seive, 
having added to every gallon of the diluted juice 3 or 4 Ibs. of sugar. 
Suffer it to ferment, and when purified, bottle closely. Mulberries 
are sub-acid in their nature and are esteemed for their highly arom- 
atic flavor. The Romans preferred it to every other fruit. In 1518 
it was introduced into England, and is known in the United States 
as the English Mulberry, but the black and red mulberry are indig- 
enous to this country. 



BEERS, ALE AND CIDER. 429 



BEERS, ALE AND CIDER. 

BEER, TOMATO. Gather the fruit when perfectly ripe and sound, 
wash it and remove the stems, then mash and strain through a coarse 
linen bag, and allow to every gallon of juice, i Ib. of good brown 
sugar, let it remain 9 or 10 days, then pour off the clear portion 
through a cloth, and leave the thick part at the bottom of the vessel. 
Then bottle closely ; it improves by age. When you wish to use it, 
fill a pitcher nearly full of fresh, sweetened water, then add some of 
the tomato liquid, a few drops of the essence of lemon, and it will 
be equal to superior lemonade, costing nothing but the trouble, 
Allow one gill or 1-2 cupful to one gallon of the sweetened water. 

PORTER BEER. Add together i bottle of London porter, 5 bot- 
tles of water, i Ib. of brown sugar or i pint of molasses; mix all 
together with some strong ginger tea. This quantity will fill seven 
bottles ; put 3 or 4 Cal. raisins into each bottle, fill, cork and wire 
them; lay them on their sides in a cool dry place. 

BEER. Dr. J. R. Pernell, Va. Take 2 gallons boiling water, i 1-2 
oz. cream tartar, and as much ginger, 1-2 pint of yeast, 2 Ibs. of 
brown sugar or a quart of molasses, mix well together. Let them 
stand 24 hours, then bottle. If 2 sliced lemons be added it im- 
proves it. 

BEER. (Mrs. Upshur, Va.) To 14 bottles of water add i quart 
of strong hop tea and i pint of molasses ; mix them well together, 
bottle and cork at once. In 24 hours, if the weather is warm, it will 
be fit for use. 

TABLE BEER. (Mrs. Upshur, Sturgis, N. Y.) Twelve gallons of 
water, 4 ears of shelled roasted corn, 2 quarts of parched oats, 2 
quarts of bran, 4 ozs. hops boiled together and strained ; add 3 pints 
of molasses and i pint of brisk yeast ; leave it to settle, then put into 
jugs or bottles. Stop closely. 

TAR BEER, (Recommended for pulmonary complaints.) One gal. 
water, 2 quarts wheat bran, i pint pure tar, i pint honey, 1-2 pint 
brewers yeast. Simmer over a slow fire for 3 hours in a clean 
earthen vessel ; add the yeast when cold. Keep in a cool place ; is 
ready for use in 36 hours ; a wineglassful to be taken before each 
meal. 

CHEAP SMALL BEER. To 12 quarts of cold water add 1-2 pint of 
strong hop tea and i 1-2 pints of molasses; mix it well together and 
bottle immediately. It will be fit for use the next day, if the weath- 
er is warm. 

CRAB APPLB BEER. Boil the fruit in a preserving or porcelain 
kettle until sufficiently acid, strain through a muslin bag ; put a 



4.30 BEERS, ALE AND CIDER. 

piece of yeast cake an inch square into ech gallon of the liquor; 
sweeten to taste. Use the second day. 

GINGER BEER. (N. O.) Take i oz. of finely pounded ginger root 
and make a quart of strong tea, add water to make 4 gallons ; into 
this dissolve 4 Ibs. of brown sugar, i ounce of cream tartar and mix 
with it thoroughly, i pint of good yeast ; let it stand 24 hours, then 
strain carefully and bottle, tying down the corks. In 48 hours from 
the time of bottling, it will be fit for use. 

APPLE CIDER Should never be left in the sun, but as soon as it 
runs through the mill place it at once in a cool place, or alcohol, 
formed by the decomposition of sugar, is converted into vinegar. 
This applies to other fruit juices as well as apples. 

THE BEST CIDER is obtained from rough sour apples but those 
containing (the sweetest) the largest amount of sugar produce 
the best vinegar. No defective apple should be ground with the 
sound ones, nor unripe ones, as they do not contain enough sugar 
to undergo the various fermentations; while they render the liquor 
rough and acidulous and prevent its clarification. 

To CHECK FERMENTATION Add 5 or 6 ozs. of mustard seeds and 
1-2 oz. of cloves, both well bruised; racking into a fresh spirit cask 
is a good plan. 

CIDER CHAMPAGNE. Good, pale, vinous cider i hogshead, pale 
proof spirits 3 gallons, honey or sugar 14 Ibs.; mix and let them 
remain together in a temperate situation for i month, then add 
orange flower water i gal. and fine down with skimmed milk 1-2 gal. 

N. B. This will be very pale and resemble champagne when 
bottled, and when duly labelled, is often sold and palmed off on those 
who are not judges of the pure article. Before bottling, a piece of 
sugar should be put into each bottle, and stored away in a cool 
place. 

To KEEPCIDER SWEET. After cider has worked to the most de- 
sirable taste, then add i 1-2 cupfuls of powdered horse radish to 
each barrel and shake it up well. After remaining a few weeks, 
rack off and bung closely in clean casks. 

CIDER, HOW TO REFINE AND KEEP SWEET FOR FAMILY USE. To 
each barrel of cider, made of sweet apples, as soon as it begins to 
work, put in i oz. of alum, 2 Ibs of charcoal, and i oz. of gum ara- 
bic, all in powder; let it stand i week, then pour it off carefully 
through a flannel bag and then bottle and cork very tight. 

CIDER DRINK. One and a half pints of cider and i pint of cold 
water, sugar to taste ; grate in some nutmeg. Good for persons who 
are billious or have rheumatismus. Sharp cider is still better. 

CHAMPAGNE CIDER. (Mrs. Davis.) Let the cider made from good 
sound apples ferment, until palatable, then draw into a clean barrel ; 



SEERS, ALE AND CIDER. 43! 

add 1-4 oz. of sulphate of lime to every gallon of cider. Mix the 
sulphate in a bucket of cider, return to the barrel and shake well ; 
let it stand till clear, when it is fit for use. 

WELSH ALE. Upon 64 gallons of malt pour 42 gallons of hot 
water, but not up to the boiling point, cover and let it stand for 3 
hours. In the mean time steep 4 Ibs. of hops in a little water and 
put them into the tub, run the unfermented liquor upon them and 
boil 3 hours. Strain off the hops and keep them for the small beer. 
Let the wort or liquor stand in a high tub till cool enough for the 
yeast, of which, whether of the ale or that of the small beer, pour in 
2 quarts ; mix the whole thoroughly and stir it often. When the 
wort has done fermenting, which will be about the zd or 3rd day, 
the yeast will sink rather than rise, and must be removed immediate- 
ly, and the ale put in casks as fast as it works out. Pour a quart in 
at a time, but gently, to prevent the fermentation from continuing 
too long. Lay some paper over the bunghole 2 or 3 days previous 
to stopping it. 

WINDSOR ALE. Take a bushel of the best pale malt, and of the 
finest hops, that have soaked all night in cold water, i lb.; i Ib. each 
of clarified honey and sugar, 1-2 lb. of well cut and bruised liquorice 
root, 1-2 oz. ground grains of paradise, 1-4 oz. orange peel, i dram 
each of coriander 'seed, cinnamon and angelica root. In the com- 
mon way, brew the whole with 3 mashings, using bran-flour instead 
of that of grain, and a little salt in the cleansing. 

CARROT ALE. Take 24 Ibs. of carrots, 4 quarts of molasses or 
treacle, 2 Ibs. of bran, dried buckbeans, 4 ozs., 12 gallons of water 
and 1-2 pint of yeast. Let the carrots be cut in thin slices, boil 
them in the water for i hour, adding a little water to supply the 
waste caused by evaporation ; strain it, mash up the bran with the 
carrot water, stir it well to prevent it from being lumpy, add the 
molasses, let it stand for half an hour, strain and boil the strained 
liquor for 15 minutes with the buckbeans. Finally strain it and set 
it to cool ; when milk warm, add the yeast ; then bung it up tightly. 
It will be found to be a cheap and agreeable beverage. 

GINGER BEER No. i. One pound lump sugar, i ounce bruised 
ginger, 1-4 ounce cream tartar, i sliced lemon, i gallon boiling 
water. Mix ; when lukewarm add 2 ounces yeast, work from 4 to 
6 hours, skim the liquor, strain and bottle. 

GINGER BEER No. 2. Put 3 pounds of good, moist brown su- 
gar into 2 gallons of water and the whites of 2 well beaten eggs; 
when near the boiling point, skim and put in 2 ounces of bruised 
ginger; let it boil for 30 minutes, then pour it boiling on the rinds 
of 2 lemons , while warm stir in a little yeast and put it into a cask 
with the pulp of the lemon, cork the next day and let it stand 15 



43 2 BEERS, ALE AND CIDER 

days, then draw off, strain and bottle it. In a few days it will be fit 
for use. 

GINGER BEER No. 3. Take i pound of hops and i pound of 
ginger root, put them in 5 gallons of water and boil for i hour; 
strain off the liquor, add 5 gallons of cold water, squeeze the mass 
of hops and ginger and add them to the former ; add 3 pints of 
molasses and boil with continual stirring until you observe a blue fog 
or vapor, then slowly add 2 quarts of cold water, stirring constantly, 
then add 7 gallons of cold water, 6 quarts and i pint of molasses 
and 2 quarts of spirits of any kind (except gin), put in 3 quarts of 
baker's or distiller's yeast ; the beer should not be more than blood 
warm when the yeast is added. Be particular to have a sweet, clean 
cask; allow it to ferment, and when done working bung it up 
tight. It will be ready for use in 30 hours. 

GINGER BEER FOR SUMMER. To i gallon of boiling water put i 
pound of loaf sugar, i ounce of best ginger root bruised and cream 
of tartar or sliced lemon. Stir it all until the sugar is dissolved, let 
it stand till milk warm, then add i tablespoonful of good hop yeast 
poured over a slice of cold loaf bread, and allow it to float on the 
surface and stand 23 hours, well covered; then strain it and fill the 
clean bottles 3-4 full ; cork with good corks and tie over. It will 
be fit for use in 2 days, and is a refreshing and healthy drink. 

CHEAP FAMILY BEER. Take a cask holding 24 gallons, 8 pounds 
of common brown sugar, 2 pounds of hops, 3 quarts of bran ; to 
be boiled 11-2 hours in 24 gallons of water. Draw it off from the 
boiler and put into the cask ; when cold stop it closely, and in one 
week it will be fit for use. 

PHILADELPHIA BEER. Take 10 pounds of brown sugar, 15 gal- 
lons of water, 3-4 pound pounded ginger, 1-8 lb cream of tartar, 
i 1-2 ounce carbonate of soda, 1-2 teaspoonful oil of lemon mixed 
in a little alcohol; whites of 5 eggs well beaten, i ounce of hops, i 
quart yeast. The ginger root and hops ought to boil 20 or 30 min- 
utes in enough water to make all milk warm, then strain into the 
rest and the yeast added, and allowed to work itself clear as the 
cider and bottled for use. 

CREAM BEER. To 2 quarts of water add 6 pounds of double- 
refined sugar, 4 ounces tartaric acid; put it on the fire, beat 2 
whites of eggs to a solid froth, and when the mixture is just 
warm add the eggs. It should not come to a boil. Strain through 
muslin without squeezing ; flavor with lemon. Bottle and keep in 
a cool place. Fill 2-3 of a tumbler with water and add 2 table- 
spoonfuls of the syrup, and when about to drink stir in 1-2 tea- 
spoonful of soda. 

BEER To cure when ropy. Put a handful or two each of flour 



BEERS, ALE AND CIDER. 433 

and hops with a little powdered alum into the beer and stir it 
well. 

LEMON BEER. Dr. F. For 10 gallons of water take 8 pounds 
of brown sugar, 4 ounces cream of tartar, 2 quarts of hop yeast, 
10 drops oil of lemon. For winter use add 1-4 ounce tartaric acid 
to sour it. Dissolve your sugar in part of the water so as to make 
it about milk-warm ; add the yeast. 

LEMON BEER No. 2. Boil 12 ounces of crushed ginger root, 1-2 
pound of cream tartar for 15 or 30 minutes in 5 or 6 gallons of wa- 
ter. This will make 40 gallons. Into this will be strained 26 Ibs. 
of nice brown or crust sugar, on which you have put 2 ounces of oil 
of lemon and 12 good lemons all squeezed together; have the water 
warm enough to bear the hand without burning; to-make 40 gals, 
put in 3 pints of hops or brewer's yeast worked into a part as for the 
cider, with 10 or 12 ozs. of flour. Let it remain until next morning, 
then strain and bottle for use. Will keep fora number of days. 

MOLASSES BEER. Boil 5 quarts of hops and 5 of wheat bran in 
15 gallons of water 4 hours and strain it. Put it into a cask with 
the head out and add 5 quarts of molasses ; stir and cover it with 
a cloth. When luke-warm stir in a quart of yeast; cover it with a 
cloth and board to fit closely, and when it has fermented and looks 
clear draw it off and put it into bottles that are well cleaned. Soak 
the corks and cork tightly. 

SPRUCE BEER. Ten gallons warm water, essence of spruce 4 oz.. 
sugar or molasses S pounds. Mix; add 1-2 pint of yeast when 
lukewarm; work from 4 to 6 hours ; bottle and strain after skimming 
the liquor. 

WHITE SPRUCE BEER. For a cask of 12 gallons mix 1-2 pound 
of the essence of spruce, 14 Ibs. of loaf sugar made into a clari- 
fied syrup and about i 1-2 gallons of hot water; stir, and when suf- 
ficiently mixed pour it into the cask and fill it nearly up with cold 
water. Add i gill of good yeast. Shake the cask well and let 
it ferment for 3 or 4 days, after which close the bung. In a few 
days draw off and bottle up, and in 7 or 8 days more it will be fit 
for use. First dissolve and add i ounce of isinglass in some of the 
warm liquor or cider to give it transparency. In cool weather more 
yeast is required than in warm. If the stone bottle for the beer be 
musty, simply fill them with dirt and water and let them remain 
3 or 4 days, then rinse with clean water. 

ROOT BEER. Eight ounces extract of liquorice dissolved in 20 
gals, of hot water, to which add good molasses i 1-2 gallons, brewer's 
yeast 8 ounces ; let it ferment for 6 or 8 hours, then to the mixture 
add 2 ounces oil of sassafras, i drachm wintergreen, 3 drops oil ot 
cloves, 10 drops oil of cinnamon mixed with i pint of alcohol, and 
it is ready for use. 



431 BEERS, ALE AND CIDER. 

CORN BEER. Boil i quart of Indian corn until the grains begin 
to burst, then put them into a jug and pour in 2 gallons of boiling 
water into the water in which it was boiled ; add a quart of molasss, 
a handful of dried apples and a large tablespoonful of ginger. It 
will be ready for use in 2 or 3 days. In cold weather set it by the 
fire. It may be kept up several weeks with the same corn. Sweeten 
the water before pouring into the jug. 

PERSIMMON BEER. This is a favorite winter drink with the col- 
ored dames of the Southern States at Christmas times. It is made 
by taking i bushel of sweet, ripe persimmons well mashed and 
worked into 1-2 bushel of wheat bran ; mix well and bake in large 
loaves. Break the loaves in a clean barrel with some small sticks 
of wood laid at the bottom in the form of a pen, then put some 
clean wheat srtraw over this, then put in the bread, and over this 
pour 12 gallons of clear water sweetened with molasses. As soon 
as the fermentation ceases it may be bottled. The beer should be 
made in a warm room. 

CIDER, TO PREPARE FOR MEDICINAL PURPOSES. Allow to each 
barrel of cider i Ib. of whole mustard seeds, i oz. each of isinglass 
and pounded alum ; do not stop the barrel or cask, but shake it up 
once or twice every 24 hours, for 5 days, then beat 6 eggs and 2 
pints of new milk well together, and pour into the cider and stir well 
3 times in 49 hours; then let it stand until clear, and draw off and 
bottle, but do not cork them until the next day, or the bottles may 
burst. NOTE. If the apples are sound and fully ripe, and the cider 
worked till clear, then poured off or racked 'twice and then bottled, 
the cider will keep pure and sweet for a great number of years. Lay 
the bottles on the side. 

APPLES AND FIGS DRINK. Cut two or three apples in six or eight 
pieces, and cut in two six fresh dried figs, and put them in a stew 
pan with one-half gallon of boiling water, and boil them briskly for 
twenty minutes; then pour the fruit and liquor into a bowl ; when 
cool, pour through a strainer. The liquor will be good to drink and 
the fruit excellent to eat, sweetened with sugar and flavored with a 
little grated lemon peel, 

CIDER CAN HAVE THE TASTE OF FOREIGN WINE. Pour it into fresh 
emptied wine casks or puncheons ; add some brown sugar to it and 
it will have all the pungency and vinosity of foreign wine. The 
night before it is intended to be bottled, the bung should be taken 
out. 

To MAKE BOTTLED CIDER VERY BRISK. When you are bottling 
the cider, put a large raisin into the bottom of each bottle before 
you put in the cider. Cork tightly. In bottling spruce or molasses 
beer, put in also a raisin. 



HOW TO PRESERVE CASKS. 435 



HOW TO PREPARE CASKS AND RESTORE WINES. 

GLAZING FOR FRESCOES OR CASKS. Mixed with benzole or Canada 
balsam, parafine is said to be superior to soluble glass for glazing over 
frescoes. By covering the interior of wine casks with a film of pure 
white parafine when in a melted state, the wine is prevented from 
spoiling or evaporating, as it will otherwise do through the wood. 

RACKING WINE. It is better to do this in cool weather. A sy- 
phon, well managed, will be found better than a faucet, in order not 
to disturb the dregs or foul portions, which can be strained through 
a bag and made into vinegar or added to some other inferior wines. 

To MAKE WINE SETTLE. Boil i pint of wheat in a quart of water 
till it breaks and becomes soft, then squeeze through a linen bag and 
put a pint of the liquor into a hogshead of unsettled white wine ; stir 
it thoroughly about and it will become pure. 

WINE, TO RESTORE WHEN SOUR OR SHARP. Fill a bag with leek- 
seeds, or grape leaves, or twists of vines, and put either of them to 
infuse in the cask. 

To IMPROVE POOR WINES. Mix 2 pounds of clear honey and a 
pint or two of brandy together and put them in the cask of wine. 

To STOP A LEAK, Make a paste of yellow soap and whiting, and 
apply it to the leak, and it will stop it. 

GERMAN METHOD OF RESTORING SOUR WiNES.-^-Put a small quan- 
tity of charcoal into the wine, shake it and let it remain 2 days ; pour 
off and put into, a clean cask or bottles. 

To IMPROVE WINE THAT is BECOMING ACID. To each gallon of 
wine allow i oz. of bitter almonds ; scald and crush them in brandy, 
draw the wine off, put the almonds into the cask, then add the wine 
on them. As soon as the acidity is gone off, bottle it. 

TO CURE A MUSTY PlPE, HOGSHEAD, CASK, OR ANY OTHER VESSEL 

OF WINE. Apply the crumb or soft part of a large wheaten or 
household loaf to the bunghole, and let it remain 6 or 7 days. A 
certain remedy to take away the must. 

To MAKE A MATCH FOR SWEETENING CASKS, HOGSHEADS, ETC. 
Melt some brimstone and dip into it a coarse linen cloth, of which, 
when cold, take a piece about an inch broad and 5 feet long, set it 
on fire and put it into the cask with one end fastened under the bung, 
which must be fastened very tight. Let it remain some hours. 

FININGS FOR WINE. Take the whites and shells of 3 fresh eggs, 
beat them in a wooden vessel till they become a thick froth ; add to 
them a little wine and whisk it up again. If the cask be full, 
take out 4 or 5 gallons and give it a good stirring ; next, whisk up 
the finings and put them in, after which stir up the whole well. Or 



436 HOW TO PRESERVE CASKS. 

dissolve an ounce of isinglass, and the whites and shells of 3 eggs ; 
beat the whole up and proceed as above. 

To KEEP WINES FROM TURNING SOUR. Boil a gallon of wine with 
some beaten oyster shells and crabs' claws, burnt to a powder, in 
the proportion of an ounce of each to every 10 gallons. Strain the 
liquor through a sieve, and when cold, put it into wine of the same 
sort, which will acquire a lively taste, A lump of unslacked lime 
will produce the same effect. 

FOR WINE, WHEN ROPY. Put a piece of coarse linen cloth 
around the end of the faucet that goes into the cask, then pour the 
wine off into a dry one, putting 5 ounces of powdered alum to 30 
gallons. Roll and shake the whole well, and it will soon become 
clarified. 

A much more simple and equally efficacious method is, merely to 
hang a bunch of hysops in at the bunghole. 

To SWEETEN WINE. Infuse a han.dful of chary flowers in 30 gals, 
of wine; then put into a bag i pound of dry white mustard seeds, 
ground, and let it sink to the bottom of the cask. When wine is 
lowering, or decaying, take an ounce of rock alum and reduce it to 
powder, draw off 4 gallons of the liquor, mix the powder with it and 
stir it well for an hour. Fill up the cask and let it fine or ferment, 
which will be in about a week. Bottle and cork tightly. 

To SWEETEN A MUSTY CASK. Take some fresh refuse from a milch 
cow and mix it with a quantity of warm water, so as to make it suf- 
ficiently liquid to pass through a large funnel, previously, however, 
dissolve in the water 2 pounds of bay salt and of alum. Put the 
whole into a pot on the fire, stirring it with a stick, and when it is 
near boiling, pour it into the cask ; then bung it tightly and shake it 
well for 5 or 6 minutes. Let it remain for 3 hours, then take out the 
bung to let the vapor escape, after which replace it and give the 
cask another shaking. At the end of 2 hours rinse it out with cold 
water till it become perfectly clean ; then have in readiness another 
pound of bay salt and 1-4 pound of alum boiled in a little water; 
pour the same into the cask and repeat the process as before. 

To TAKE AWAY THE ILL SCENT OF WINE. Take a roll ofdough 
stuck with cloves, hang it in the cask, and it will extract the ill scent 
from the wine itself. 

To KEEP WINES FROM BECOMING ACID. Pour in the cask from the 
bung, a flask of olive oil, and it will preserve the same from acidity 
to the last drop. 

VARNISH OR ENAMEL, FOR COATING THE INSIDE OF CASKS. A new 
application of charcoal has recently been made in England for the 
manufacture of a permanent enamel or varnish for coating the inside 
of casks. The charcoal, which is made from the wood of the white 



CORDIALS. 437 

willow, is reduced to a very fine powder and mixed with proper pro- 
portions of shellac and methylated spirit. When ready for use, it 
is laid on with a brush and the inside of the cask fired, so as to re- 
move the spirits and leave the lining of charcoal and shellac; it is 
then coated again and fired a second time, after which it is allowed 
to stand a short time before being used. This composition is said 
to form a perfect enamel, and while it prevents any leakage, it pre- 
serves the casks in an extraordinary manner. It answers admirably 
for beer and acids and is largely adopted by some of our principal 
brewers. 

CORDIALS, BRANDIES, ETC. 

PEACH CORDIAL. Gather White Heath or very nice cling stone 
peaches, cut them to the stone in several places, and fill jars or 
casks; cover them with peach brandy, and let them remain 8 weeks. 
Then to every gallon allow 2 Ibs, of sugar, 1-2 pint -of water; make 
a syrup by boiling sugar and water, and when cold, mix 1-2 syrup 
and 1-2 brandy. Bottle or keep it in the cask. 

PEACH CORDIAL. Allow 4 Ibs. of sugar to i gal. of brandy, 4 oz. 
peach kernels blanched, or blanched almonds, or a mixture of equal 
quantities of both, cut the kernels up and pour the brandy over the 
sugar to melt it. You may sprinkle the sugar over with water very 
lightly at first, to dissolve it. Let it simmer over the fire for one 
hour with the kernels. Let it settle three or four days, then pour off 
clear from the kernels and bottle it. 

PINE APPLE BRANDY CORDIAL. Boil 2 Ibs. of loaf sugar in 2 
quarts of spring water, remove the froth ; when cold, add 2 quarts 
of brandy, put into a stone jar. Brush clean the outside of a pine- 
apple, cut into slices about half an inch thick, allowing 2 Ibs for the 
above quantity of sugar and water, put the slices in the liquor or 
syrup; close tightly. In a month's time the liquor will be fit to 
drink, and the pineapple fit to eat. N. B. In about three month's 
time the brandy will have extracted all the flavor out of the pines, 
which should be eaten at once, and the syrup put into pint bottles, 
and closely sealed, and kept in a cool dry place. 

THE SYRUP To drink as a cordial, to put into punch to give it 
the flavor of pineapple, and over strawberries or raspberries before 
you eat them. 

QUINCE CORDIAL. Grate the quinces and strain them, and to 
every quart of juice, put i Ib. of sugar and i pint spirits; boil, strain 
and bottle it. 

CORDIAL FOR THE STOMACH. Mrs. Kull, of Hamburg. 6 quarts 
pure brandy, i 1-2 oz. of cloves, 1-4 oz. cinnamon, 1-2 oz. cardo- 



438 CORDIALS. 

man seed, 2 oz. dried blackberries, 6 oz. sugar ; put in a bottle after 
steeping, pour off into another bottle, and refill with fresh brandy, 
and let steep again. Valuable. 

USQUEBAUGH OB IRISH CORDIAL. 2 quarts of whiskey, without a 
smoky taste, or the best brandy; put in i Ib. of stewed raisins, 1-2 
oz. of nutmeg, 1-4 oz. cloves, the same quantity of cardomans, all 
crushed in a mortar ; the rind of a large, ripe and juicy orange, 
rubbed off on lumps of sugar; the juice, a little tincture of saffron, 
and 1-2 Ib. of brown sugar candy. Shake the infusion every day for 
2 weeks, and filter for use. It is sometimes tinged to a fine green 
with the juice of spinage. 

WHISKEY CORDIAL. Take i Ib. of ripe white currants, the rind of 
a lemon, 1-4 oz. of grated ginger, i quart of whiskey, i Ib. of burnt 
sugar; strip the currants from the stalks, put them in a large jug, 
add the lemon rind, ginger and whiskey, cover the jug closely and 
let it remain covered for 24 hours ; strain through a hair sieve ; add 
the burnt sugar and let it stand 1 2 hours longer ; then bottle and cork 
well. 

GINGER CORDIAL. Allow one drachm of the essence of ginger to 
two gallons of spirits ; it will be improved if two or three drops each 
of essence of lemon and orange peel be added with about one table- 
spoonful of essence of cardomans, to each gallon of the spirits. If 
a dark color is desired, color with burnt sugar, allowing i 1-2 Ibs. to 
each gallon. 

LEMON CORDIAL. Steep 2 oz. each of fresh and dried lemon 
peel, i oz. of fresh orange peel, in i gallon of spirits for six or seven 
days, then express by straining, add 4 quarts of soft clear water to 
bring it to the required strength; then add 3 Ibs. of sugar to each 
gallon ; to the above ingredients some persons add a little orange 
flower water to improve it. 

LEMON CORDIAL. Cut 6 fresh lemons and put into three pints of 
milk, boil them until the whey is very clear, then pass it through a 
sieve. Put to the whey 3 pints of French brandy and 3 Ibs of clari- 
fied sugar; stir it until the sugar it dissolved ; let it stand to refine, 
then put some chips of lemon peel cut thin in bottles, and fill with 
the cordial. This keeps well and is very nice. 

MACCARONI CORDIAL. Steep for 15 days in 9 pints of brandy, i 
Ib. of bitter almonds, with Spanish Angelica root, beaten together, 
shaking the vessel often ; at the end of that time put the- whole into 
a cucubite, and distil it in a water bath; 5 pints thus impregnated 
with the flavor of the almonds, and angelica, make a syrup with 5 
Ibs. of sugar, 2 quarts of water from a thousand flowers, and 3 
quarts of common distilled water, when this is mixed with the spirits, 
add 30 drops of the essence of lemon, after which, filter through 
blotting paper. 



CORDIALS. 439 

MUSCADINE CORDIAL. Mash the muscadines to a pulp, let them 
stand for a day and night, strain the mass through a strong muslin

towel, set it into a saucepan of water to simmer till the sugar is 
melted ; when cold put into small bottles, cork well and it will keep 
a long time ; excellent to eat with sweet sauces, in water and sugar 
to abate thirst; should be drank at once, as it becomes flat. 

STRAWBERRY CORDIAL. Stew ripe strawberries 20 minutes and 
squeeze them through a linen bag ; to each quart of juice put i Ib. 
of sugar, i pint of white brandy ; put it in a demijohn to stand two 
weeks, then filter it through coarse muslin, or fine seive and

it to the juice, stir it, allow 1-2 pint spirits to this quantity; when 
cold bottle closely. 

CINNAMON CORDIAL. One drachm of oil of cinnamon to 2 or 
3 gallons of spirits, 2 or 3 drops of essence of lemon and orange 
peel will improve it ; some add to the above quantity i drachm of 
cardamon seeds and one ounce each of dried orange and lemon 
peel ; one oz. of oil of cassia is considered to be equal to 8 pounds 
of buds or barks ; if wanted dark color with burnt sugar ; allow i 1-2 
pounds to the gallon ; instead of cinnamon some persons either use 
the essential oil or bark of cassia. 



CORDIALS. 44! 

EAU DE BARBADES Citonelle. Fresh orange peel 2 oz. ; 
fresh lemon peel, 4 oz. ; cloves, 1-2 drachm ; corianders and cin- 
namon of each i drachm; proof spirits, 4 pints; digest for ten days, 
then add water i quart and distil 1-2 gallon; to the rectified cordial 
add white sugar 2 pounds. 

EGG CORDIAL. A teaspoonful of cream, the white of a very fresh 
egg, and a teaspoonful of brandy; whip first the egg to 'nearly a 
froth, then the cream with the egg ; add the brandy by degrees and 
mix well ; do not let it stand after it is made ; this is very nourish- 
ing, and so light it will remain in the stomach when nothing else 
will ; a valuable cordial for weak lungs. 

BLACKBERRY BRANDY. U. S. Sanitary Commission Recipes. 
Eleven quarts of blackberries, make i gallon of juice; to i gallon of 
juice, add 4 pounds of white sugar, boil and skim it, add i oz. of 
cloves, i oz. of cinnamon, 10 grated nutmegs, boil again, when 
cold, add i pint of the best whisky or brandy. 

To TEST GOOD BRANDY. The strength of brandy may be deter- 
mined by olive oil or tallow, both of which will sink in good 
brandy. 

IRISH WHISKY Dr. Flobereau. First, i gallon brandy, i pound 
stoned raisins, cinnamon, cloves, nutmegs, cardamons, each i oz , 
crushed in a mortar, saffron 1-2 oz., rind of California orange and 
sugar candy. Shake these well ; fourteen days afterward fine for 
use. 

LEMON BRANDY. i pint of good brandy, the rind of two small 
lemons, 2 oz. of loaf sugar, 1-4 pint of water; peel the lemons 
rather thin, taking care to have none of the white pith ; put the rinds 
into a bottle with the brandy and let them steep for 24 hours ; strain 
them; boil the sugar with the water for a few minutes, skim it, and, 
when cold, add it to the brandy ; a desert spoonful will be found an 
excellent flavoring for boiled custards. 

ORANGE BRANDY. To every 1-2 gallon of brandy allow 3-4 pint 
of California orange juice, 11-2 pounds of loaf sugar. To fully 
develop the flavor of the orange peel, rub a few lumps of the 
sugar on two or three unpared oranges, and put these lumps aside. 
Mix the brandy with the orange juice, strained, the rinds of six of 
the oranges pared thin and the sugar. Let all stand in a closely 
covered jar for three days, stirring it three or four times a day. 
When clear it should be bottled and corked closely for a year ; it 
will then be ready for use and will keep for any length of time. This 
is a most excellent stomachic, when given in small quantities ; as the 
strength of the brandy is very little deteriorated by the other ingre- 
dients, it may be diluted with water. 

BLACK CHERRY BRANDY. To 4 pounds of stoned black cherries 



442 FRUIT ICES AND SYRUPS. 

add 3 quarts of brandy ; bruise the stones and add them to the 
mixture ; infuse for a month ; filter and add the flavoring ingre- 
dients and syrup as directed (cinnamon and cloves) to taste. 
Liquors flavored with the kernels of fruits should not be sweet. A 
weaker decoction may be obtained by pouring more spirits in the 
fruit. Some persons object to all perfumes in compounds of this 
kind. 

MORILLO CHERRY BRANDY. Pick morillo or black cherries from 
the stalks and drop them into bottles till the bottles are three-fourths 
full, fill up with brandy or whisky. In three weeks strain off the 
spirits and season with cinnamon and clove mixture, as in the rasp- 
berry brandy, adding syrup to taste. Ratafia in liquors seasoned 
with kernels of fruits should be rich, but not sweet. 

COMMON RATAFIA. Take i oz. of pounded nutmegs, 1-2 pound 
of almonds, scalded, skinned and chopped, and i grain of amber- 
gris well rubbed with sugar in a mortar. Infuse in 2 quarts of proof 
spirits for a fortnight and filter. 

EAU DE VIE. Thinly pare 7 large oranges or lemons, or part of 
each; dissolve and clear 6 oz. of double-refined sugar in half a pint 
of pure water ; this should be done in a silver or glass vessel. 
When quite clear add to it 1-4 pint of milk, warm from the cow ; if 
that cannot be obtained rich new milk restored to that degree of 
warmth ; then put into an earthen vessel or large bottle the rind, 
syrup and milk, with a quart of old rum or French brandy. Per- 
fumes may be used if desired. 

FRUIT ICES AND SYRUPS. 

ALMOND AND RASPBERRY IcES.^-Blanch, peel and pound 1-2 Ib. 
of sweet almonds and 1-2 oz. bitter almonds: boil 3 pints of double 
cream; when cool add 1-2 Ib. of pounded sugar and 12 yolks of 
eggs, stir over the fire without boiling until the egg thickens ; add 
the pounded almonds and i tablespoonful of cherry brandy, and 
strain the whole through a tammy cloth into a basin. Mix i quart 
of raspl)"rry juice and i quart of hot syrup, and strain through a 
silk sieve. Set 2 freezing pots in the ice, put the almond cream in 
i pot and the raspberry syrup in another; freeze and work the ices, 
draw the water out of the pails, replenish them with fresh ice and 
bay salt, close the freezing pots and cover them wiith ice and put a 
wet cloth on the top : pile the ices up on a napkin on a dish in reg- 
ular layers, mingling the colors, and serve. 

BURNT ALMOND AND ORANGE ICE. Chop 2 ounces of blanched 
almonds, melt 2 tablespoonfuls of pounded sugar in a sugar boiler, 
add the chopped almonds and stir over the fire until they assume a 



FRUIT ICES AND SYRUPS. 443 

red-brown color, and spread, them on a baking sheet; boil i 1-2 
pints of double cream ; put 6 yolks of eggs in a stew pan with 
1-4 pound of pounded sugar, add the boiled cream and stir over the 
fire until the eggs thickens ; pound the burnt almonds in a mortar, 
add them to the cream and strain the whole through a tammy cloth 
into a basin. Mix i pint of orange juice with i pint of syrup in 
which some orange peel has been steeping, and strain through a 
silk sieve. Squeeze the ices and mould them together, as described 
for strawberry cream. 

ICED CHAMPAGNE GRANITE WITH STRAWBERRIES. Set a freezing 
pot in some pounded ice and bag salt, pour i quart of warm syrup 
and 2 bottles of champagne, let it freeze to icicles, and add i Ib. 
of picked strawberries, and serve the granite in glasses. 

N. B. The above quantity is calculated for twenty-two or twenty- 
four persons. 

ICED LEMON GRANITE. Set a freezing pot in the ice and pour in 
3 pints of syrup and i gill of filtered lemon juice ; freeze it into 
icicles and and serve the granite in glasses. 

ICED ORANGE GRANITE. Remove the peel of 6 oranges, cut them 
into quarters, removing all the white skin and pips; put the pieces of 
orange in a basin with 3 pints of syrup, let them steep 2 hours, then 
drain them and strain the syrup through a silk sieve into a freezing- 
pot ; set in ice. When the syrup is frozen to icicles put in the pieces 
of orange, cover the freezing pot for 20 minutes, and serve the 
granite in glasses. 

PARFAIT AU COFFEE. Roast 1-2 pound of coffee in a copper 
pan, boil 3 pints of double cream, put the coffee in it, cover the 
stew pan and let the coffee steep for i hour. Put 12 yolks of 
eggs in a stew pan with 1-2 pound of pounded sugar, strain the 
cream, add it to the eggs in the stew pan, stir over the fire with- 
out boiling until it thickens, and strain through a tammy cloth. 
Set in a freezing pot and parboil, mould in some pounded ice 
and bag salt, put the cream in the freezing pot and work it with 
the spatula. When the cream is partly frozen add 1-2 gill of 
syrup. Continue working the cream, and when the syrup is well 
mixed add another 1-2 gill of syrup and i quart of well-whipped 
cream. Fill the mould with the iced cream, close it hermetri- 
cally and imbibe it in the ice for 2 hours. Turn the parfait out of 
the mould on a napkin on a dish and serve- 

COFFEE ICE. Take strong and clear coffee, sweeten it well with 
loaf sugar and allow to 2-3 coffee 1-3 cream. Freeze as any other 
cream. 

To CLARIFY SUGAR OR SYRUP FOR FRUIT AND ICED DRINKS. 
Allow 1-2 pint of water and 1-2 white of an egg to i Ib. of sugar. 



444 ICE FREEZERS, ETC. 

The egg should be well beaten. Put them all into a preserving or 
an enameled kettle, add the sugar, dissolve z minutes, then put it on 
the fire ; when it boils 5 minutes throw in a teacupful of water. 
After this is added do not stir the sugar. Bring it to the boiling point 
again, then place the pan by the fire for the preparation to settle. 
Remove all the scum and the sugar will be ready for use. The scum 
should be placed in a sieve, so that what runs from the sieve may 
be boiled up again. This must be well skimmed also. 

FRUIT ICE WATERS. To every pint of fruit juice allow i pint of 
the above syrup. Select the nice, ripe fruit, pick it well and put it 
into a large earthen pan or bowl with a little pounded sugar over it. 
Stir the fruit with an earthen spoon until it is well broken, then rub 
it through a hair sieve. In using the above syrup it is better to 
omit the eggs. Let it cool, add the fruit juice; then mix well to- 
gether and put the mixture into a freezing pot. When the mixture 
is equally frozen put it into small glasses. Blackberry, strawberry, 
currant and other fresh fruit water ices are made in the same man- 
ner. Take 30 minutes to freeze the mixture. . 

GINGER BEER POWDERS. One pound of finely powdered white 
sugar, super carbonate of soda 2 1-2 ounces, 1-2 ounce each of 
gum arabic and ginger in powder, 36 drops oil of lemon ; mix and 
divide into 36 powders, put into white paper; put 36 grains of tar- 
taric acid in blue papers. The powders in the white papers should 
first be dissolved, and afterwards add the contents of the blue 
paper. 

ICE, FREEZERS, ETC. 

ICE TO PRESERVE. Put the ice in a deep dish, cover with the top 
or plate and place the dish on a feather pillow and cover the top 
with another carefully to exclude the external air, and cover with a 
blanket. 

ANOTHER WAY. Make 2 bags of stout woolen fabric ; the outer 
bag should be made at least 2 inches wider each way than the in- 
ner one. After placing one bag inside the other, stuff feathers be- 
tween the two and sew the bags together at the top. A block of ice 
thus treated will keep well from melting a week ; otherwise it would 
melt in an hour. 

NOTE Blankets should be wrapped over it and the bags may be 
made of blankets and others rolled around. 

To KEEP ME^T FROZEN. After the meat is frozen, tie in papers 
and pack in a flour barrel with clean straw, pushing the straw down 
tightly with a thin lath, then put the board in a box 5 or 6 inches 
larger than the barrel every way, and fill the space with the saw- 
dust. 



ICE, FREEZERS, ETC. 445 

HOW TO KEEP THE SMALLEST PORTION OF ICE FOR THE SlCK. 

Take a piece of flimsy flannel of thin texture and cut it about 9 
or ten inches square and tie it firmly around a cup or tumbler, leave 
a depression reaching half way down the tumbler, then fill the de- 
pression with ice, then over the top place loosely a piece of open 
or thin flannel 4 or 5 inches square. This will keep the ice for 10 
or ii hours, for the ice, as it meits and the water drains through the 
flannel leaves it dry. Two ounces of ice has been known to keep 
in this way for more than 10 hours. If thick flannel is used, cut a 
small hole in the bottom depression for the water to pass through; a 
cup or any vessel will do as well as a tumbler. An economical plan 
for preserving ice when it is scarce, for the sick. 

ICE FOR KEEPING FRUITS OR VEGETABLES. The field. Lay the 
fruit or vegetables on cotton in tia boxes (biscuit boxes will do) 
without any packing about them. Shut down the lid and simply set 
the boxes in the ice. Peaches will keep in this way a month after 
they are dead ripe and nectarines 6 weeks, placing them in shallow 
tin boxes with cotton between them. When taken from the ice they 
should be used at once. Melons will keep 3 or 4 weeks; cucumbers 
will keep a long time ; French beans should be packed in bundles 
and set on their ends. 

ICE TO KEEP FOR A WEEK. Wrap tightly a piece of flannel twice 
around a piece of ice, then wind around a bag of hair or any kind 
of feathers. Then over this pin a piece of flannel, a woolen gar- 
ment or blanket, or even straw, but it is not so good; keep in a 
cool place, or a hole in the ground or a cool room. 

How TO FREEZE QUICKLY. The freezing pot or mould must be 
well set. Place it in the center of the pail ; it must be large enough 
to give a space of 4 inches all around. Break up 13 pounds of ice, 
which put around the bottom six inches in depth, over which put 2 
pounds of salt; beat down tight with a rolling pin, then more ice, 
then salt, and thus continue until within 3 inches of the top of the 
freezing pot or mould. Saltpetre mixed with the salt will facilitate 
it in freezing. 

FREEZING WITHOUT ICE. Put 3 pints of pure spring water into a 
gallon stone jug, then add 2 ounces of pure saltpetre (nitre) in fine 
powder; stop the jug very closely and let it down into a deep well 
for 3 hours or longer, when the water will have become solid ice, 
but to obtain it the jug must be broken. 

NOTE If the jug is plunged up and down into and out of 
the water it will freeze much more readily. 

To KEKP ICE WATER COLD. Place between 2 sheets of batting 
1-2 inch thick; place the ends of the paper and batting together, 
forming a cylinder like a section of a stove pipe. Place this over 



446 ICE, FREEZERS, ETC. 

an ordinary pitcher filled with ice water, making it deep enough 
to rest on the table. Put over the top a circular cover made in 
the same way as the cylinder. This will keep boiling water hot 
as \vdl as ice water cold, since it excludes the air from either. 

MATCHLESS FREEZING PREPARATION. Common sal ammoniac 
well pulverized, i part, saltpetre, 2 parts ; mix well together, then take 
common soda well pulverized. To use : Take equal parts of this 
preparation (which must be kept separate and well covered previous 
to using), and then put into the freezing-pot ; add of water a proper 
quantity and put in the article to be frozen in a proper vessel, cover 
up and your wants are supplied. 

NOTE For freezing cream or wines this cannot be beaten. 

LEMON AND FRUIT ICES. J. C. Add the whites of 6 eggs beaten 
to a solid froth to i quart of rich lemonade. Freeze it. Straining 
and sweetening any kind of fruit juice before putting in the egg-, 
will do. 

ICED APPLES. Pare and core i dozen large apples, fill with su- 
gar, very little butter and cinnamon, bake till nearly done, let them 
cool, and if you can, without breaking, put on another dish; if not, 
pour off the juice, having some icing prepared ; lay on top and side 
and set it into the oven a minute or two to brown slightly. Serve 
with cream. 

ICK FOR KEEPING FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. The field. Lay the 
fruit upon cotton in any kind of tin box without being particular as 
to order. Then simply place the box on the ice, but do not sur- 
round it with the ice. Even dead ripe fruit may be kept in this way 
for more than a month, but in this case the tin boxes should be shal- 
low, with a piece of cotton between the fruit, leaving them other- 
wise uncovered. They should be used as soon as taken from the 
ice. Melons will keep for weeks in this way, or in an ice house. 
I have eaten them after being kept for 6 weeks by simply putting 
them in an ice house. Cucumbers will keep a long time by putting 
them in tin boxes, as the fruit. 

MANNER OF FREEZING FRUIT WATER. Put the freezing can into 
a pail containing pounded ice, upon which is sprinkled saltpetre or 
common salt, then surround the can with pounded ice and saltpetre 
or common salt nearly to the top. Wipe the cover and edges of 
the can, pour in the .preparation and close the lid, wait 15 minutes 
and then begin turning the freezing pot from right to left; when the 
mixture begins to freeze around the sides of the pot, stir it about 
with a wooden spoon, that the congealation may be equal, close the 
lid again and continue to work from right to left, as before, and from 
time to time remove the ice from the sides to equalize it ; and it 
should remain on the ice till wanted for the table. 



ICE, FREEZERS, ETC. 447 

THE BEST FREEZING POT is made of pewter, as the freezing is 
more equal and smoother and thorough ; the tin freezing pot con- 
geals too rapidly for that, and the thorough mingling of its contents, 
upon which the excellence of the ice depends. Instead of a wood- 
en spoon, a copper one may be used as it is stronger, but it should 
be kept bright and clean. The ice tub is prepared with fresh 
pounded ice and salt, the freezing pot is put in it and surrounded 
with the preparation to the top of the cover; when the ingredients to 
be frozen are not of equal gravity, to prevent their separation and 
the heaviest falling to the bottom of the can, it is important to turn 
it round and round by the handle, to keep its contents moving until 
congealation commences ; by neglecting this, the whole contents of 
the freezing pot may be destroyed, lumps may be formed, the sugar 
sink to the bottom, leaving the cream insufficiently sweetened ; re- 
move, as soon as formed the frozen portions from the sides of the 
freezer and stir it. Delicate and aged persons and children should 
abstain from ices or iced drinks, and persons in health should not 
use them too freely. They should be taken just after or some hours 
after a meal ; that is, before digestion fully commences, or after it is 
completed; cold fruits impede digestion and often provoke indispo- 
sition. They should be abstained from by persons when very warm, 
or immediately after taking violent exercise; when indulged in under 
such circumstances, they have produced illness, which has ended fatal- 
ly. The use of ices was first introduced by Catharine De Medici. Could 
these cooling and refreshing preparations have mitigated the fire of 
her bigotry, then the massacre of St. Bartholomew had never 
occurred. 

COLORING TO STAIN JELLIES, ICES OR CAKES. For a beautiful red, 
boil 15 grains of cochineal in the finest powder, with i 1-2 drachms 
of cream of tartar, in 1-2 pint of water, very slowly, 1-2 hour, adding 
in boiling, a bit of alum the size of a pea ; or, use beet root sliced, 
and some liquor poured over it. 

FOR WHITE Use almonds finely powdered, with a little drop of 
water, or use cream. 

FOR YELLOW Yolks of eggs, or a bit of saffron steeped in the 
liquor and squeezed. 

FOR GREEN Pound Spinach leaves or -beet leaves (the white 
sugar beet), express the juice, and boil in a teacup within a saucer 
of water to take off the rawness. 

ICE WATERS. Rub some fine sugar on lemon or orange to give 
color or flavor, then squeeze the juice of either on its respective 
peel, add water and sugar to make a fine sherbet, and strain it be- 
fore it is put into the ice pot. If orange the greater proportion 
should be the best orange juice and a small bit of the peel grated 
by the sugar. 



448 THE FARM. 

THE MOVING of any fluid accelerates the cold ; and likewise, when 
any fluid is tending to heat, stirring will facilitate its boiling. 

WEST INDIAN SYRUP. To i gallon of boiling water, put 5 Ibs. of 
loaf sugar, and 2 oz. of citric acid; when cold, add 1-2 dram of 
essence of lemon, and 1-2 dram of spirits of wine ; stir it well to- 
gether and bottle. 2 tablespoonfuls to a glass of water, (very cold), 
makes a delicious summer drink. 

PINE APPLE SYRUP. Boil i quart of syrup until it falls, to this, 
add i pint of pine apple juice ; let it boil, remove the scum and 
bottle. 

GINGER SYRUP. Ginger root, i oz. (bruised); boil 10 minutes in 
i pint of water. If flavoring is desired, select. 

SARSAPARILLA SYRUP. i oz. extract liquorice, dissolve in i pint of 
boiling water, and add to i gallon of good molasses or syrup; add 
also i drachm oil of sassafras, 1-2 drachm oil of wintergreen, dis- 
solved in 1-2 oz. of alcohol. 

LEMON SYRUP. 4 Ibs. sugar, 2 pints water; boil, and when cool 
add i oz, tartaric acid, and i drachm of oil of lemon ; dissolve in 1-2 
oz. of alcohol, and also 2 ounces mucilage of gum aaabic. 

SEIDLITZ POWDERS, 6 oz. Rochelle salts, 2 oz. super-carbonate 
soda ; mix and divide into 24 powders ; put them in white papers 
into the blue papers put 30 grains of tartaric acid. 

THE FARM. 

WASHINGTON managed his mother's farm in boyhood, and looked 
after the cattle. 

GIRLS should be taught to look after the poultry and have some of 
their own, and even this is well for boys, for I have seen the happy 
effect of it. It cultivates industrious habits and they soon fall in 
love with it, and then it keeps them out of the way of temptation. 
Point them to suggestions on the subject and this will cause them 
to look into things and cultivates an enquiring mind. 

THE FARMER, WHAT HE DOES. -He feeds all peoples and nations, 
supports every enterprise, pursuit, calling and professions, and among 
all civilized nations in every age of the world, not only the farmer, 
but the profession has been held in the highest honor, and was regard- 
ed as the basis not only of individual comfort and success, but of 
national greatness. If the soil locks up its treasures, then all enter- 
prises perish, and the world is in woe and want. The sun of pros- 
perity is in total eclipse. When Rome was in her agricultural glory, 
several of her noblest families derived their patronyms from 
some vegetables which they were famous for raising, such as the 
Tabii pea, Sentuli, Cicerones, etc., etc. Cato says : "Study to have.

a large dung hill," and to this I would add, "Treat your dumb labor- 
ers as inferior brothers, deprived of speech." In his immortal 
Georgics, Virgil sings to its praise, and Cato extols it in his highest 
philosophy. 

To MAKE MARSHY PLACES HEALTHY, our lady farmers should cul- 
tivate, in swamps, the following trees and flowers, namely : The 
blue gum, cherry, laurel, juniper, lemon, pine, cedar, clovus, laven- 
der, mint, fennel, bergamot, anis, nutmeg and thyme ; and the flow- 
ers of the narcissus, hyacinth, mignonette, heliotrope and lily of the 
vally. These flowers have a powerful oxidizing influence of ozone, 
and are recommended to be planted in marshy districts and all places 
infested with animal emanations, thus producing a healthful influ- 
ence. It is easily done. Flowers without perfume do not deve 1 - 
op ozone. 

JUVENILE FARMERS. Since every boy expects to come in poses- 
sion of a farm, they should, while boys, learn everything about it, 
and even how to dispose of their grain, as well as to grow it; to take 
care of cattle and sell it, and also their sheep and wool. This should 
be a nucleus. 

SWEET POTATO VINES can be kept through the winter. "Before 
the frost, cut the vines to a suitable length and place in layers in the 
surface of the earth at the depth of i to i 1-2 feet, cover the vines 
with partially rotted straw to the depth of i 1-2 feet and cover the 
whole with a light soil about 4 inches deep. By this method the 
vines will keep through the winter, and in the spring they will sprout 
out as abundantly as the potato itself, When bedded, the draws or 
sprouts can be planted first and the vine can be subsequently cut 
and used as slips are generally planted. 

THE SILK WoitMS IN CHINA are fed on the leaf of the white mul- 
berry. 

SILK WORMS. Mrs. Andrews. One oz. of eggs, if good, will pro- 
duce about 40,000 worms, and then, when at their full growth will re- 
quire about 185 square feet of shelf room. They will eat about 
1500 or 1600 pounds of mulberry leaves during their growth and 
should produce from 45 to 50 pounds of cocoons. From these data 
readers can make their own calculations. 

AMUSEMENTS ON THE FARM. Probably no class enjoy life better 
than our farmers. The pursuit of agriculture is itself a pleasure to 
those who view it rightly ; children in the country are seldom want- 
ing for amusement, and the corn huskings and the quilting bees form 
green spots in the memory of many a man, whose boyhood was pass- 
ed upon the farm. A favorite amusement with the young and often 
relished by "children of larger growth," is the construction and parad- 
ing after night-fall of jack-o'-lantefrns. The golden pumpkin is taken. 



450 "fME FARM. 

from the store within the granary or chosen from frost bitten vines, 
and having been subjected to the process of scooping, is made ready 
for the chisel of the embryo sculptor ; with cunning hand our young 
artist applies his unerring jack-knife to the glistening rind. At first 
he traces with delicate touch the outline of features, which he possi- 
bly intends to be majestic, Jove like in their effect upon the behol- 
der. The features having been determined on, the chiseling 
knife cuts deeper, until only a paper like thickness of the inner rind 
remains. The fragment of a tallow candle is then inserted through 
a hole in the top of the disembowelled pumpkin and the lantern is 
ready for exhibition, when the candle is lighted, and it is carried in- 
to a group of children. It is a source of infinite amusement to the 
larger ones, though the "wee small children" appear startled, and if 
we did not know the origin, we think that few of us could withstand 
such a genii-like glance as flashes from the outer features of the 
average jack-o'-lantern. 

FARM YARDS should be kept dry and warm with shelters for the 
cattle, hogs and poultry; then they would keep healthy and prosper. 

A PIT OR TANK Should be kept on every ranch or farm to 
receive the dish water, offal of vegetables and animals, &c., which 
the cook should throw into a tub for the purpose. It should be 
emptied daily into this pit, which should be closely shut by doors 
on hinges with an apperture to open it, of a foot and one-half 
square, with a ring to lift it by, to pour in the contents of the 
tub. No unpleasant smell should be allowed to escape from it. 
The contents of this pit will form valuable manure for garden or 
field purposes. Or if pigs are kept, pieces of bread, stale bread 
crusts, bacon rinds, pieces of meat, stale milk, the washings of 
greasy pots, vegetables, &c., can be put in a tub for the pigs. 
The mistress should see that nothing is wasted, and if her cook is 
extravagant or wasteful, she had better change her for one more 
economical. For extravagance and waste will produce want some- 
where ; and it may fall on the family of the employer, but more 
likely on the cook. 

To DRIVE RATS FROM A BUILDING. Dissolve 2 ounces of glue, 2 
ounces of assafoetida, 2 ounces of potash in water, and add 1-2 oz. 
of phosphorus to the mixture. Then in a wire cage or trap baited 
with corn meal scented with oil of anis catch 2 or 3 rats ; if they 
are very numerous more will be necessary. Singe the hair partly off 
these in such a way as to hurt them as little as possible, then give 
them a slight coating with the above mixture heated warm ; let them 
loose in their holes, and there will be no more trouble with the rats 
for months to come. This mixture will last for 2 years. Or, take 
chloride of lime and scatter it dry all around their holes and where- 
ever they haunt, and they will leave at once. 



THE FARM. 451 

To FREE BARNS AND OUT-HOUSES FROM MITES AND WEEVILS. 
Let the walls and rafters, above and below, of the gran- 
aries be completely covered with quick lime slacked in water, in 
which trefoil, worm wood and hyssop or max vomica have been 
boiled. This composition should be applied as hot as possible. A 
farmer who had his granaries empty in June last collected quanti- 
ties of the largest sized ants in sacks and scattered them about the 
place infected with weevils. The ants at once fell upon and devoured 
them all. 

To DESTROY THE WEEVIL IN GRAIN. Soak linen cloths in water 
wring them out and cover your grain with them; in 2 hour's time you 
will find all the weevils upon the cloth, which must be carefully gath- 
ered off, that none of the insects may escape, and then immerse in 
hot water to destroy them. 

To PURIFY TALLOW ON A GRANGE. The fresh tallow is melted 
in boiling water, and when completely dissolved, and consequently 
hot, is passed through a linen filter, then rendered solid by cool- 
ing and washing with water, and lastly separated from it carefully 
by pressure. It may be melted at a moderate heat and preserved 
in earthen vessels covered with a bladder, paper or good closing 
lid. If the linen filter is not thick enough to keep the other in- 
gredients from passing through besides the liquid tallow and wa- 
ter, it is better to repeat the filtration. Tallow thus obtained may 
be used for ordinary food ; for pomades, by the addition of pure 
olive oil ; for salves and plasters, by the addition of white wax, and 
may be kept well preserved for a time as free from smell as when 
prepared. By following the above directions the tallow will keep a 
long time without becoming rancid. 

To MAKE HARD TALLOW CANDLES. Dissolve 2 pounds of alum 
in hot water, render it in 10 pounds of tallow, and it will make can- 
dles to burn equal to spermacetti. * 

To BLOW OUT A CANDLE. Hold the candle above you when you 
blow it out, and the wick will not smolder down, and can be easily 
lighted again. 

How TO TRAIN SHEPHERD D$GS. In southern California, where 
shepherds attend their flocks day and night, they commence train- 
ing their dogs in the following manner. When a lamb is born, 
it is taken from the mother sheep before she has seen it, and a 
pup put in its place. The sheep suckles the puppy and learns 
to love it ; when the puppy grows old enough to eat meat, it 
is fed in the morning and sent out with its mother. At length, im- 
patient to return where it hopes to get another piece of meat, it be- 
gins to tease and worry its mother and finally starts her towards 
home ; the other sheep follow, and thus the whole flock is brought 



452 THE FARM. 

home. If the dog brings the sheep home too early or comes home 
without them, he gets no supper, or is punished in another way, hence 
he soon learns when to come and to see that none of his charge are 
Lfc behind. These animals are trained by taking advantage of their 
instincts and appetites. It is said that one may go over the hills 
and plains and see thousands of sheep, but not a man to watch them. 
Around each flock or band of a thousand sheep are a half dozen dogs 
of a peculiar breed, dogs, whose progenitors were imported from the 
sheep pastures of the old world. These dogs take the entire care of 
the sheep, drive them out to pasture in the morning, keep them from 
going astray during the day and bring them home at night. They 
have inherited the talent for keeping sheep. 

DISTEMPER IN DOGS. As soon as you perceive that your dog is 
sick, throw down his throat a handful of very fine salt, 3 times a day 
for 3 or 4 consecutive days. This remedy has never failed. 

A GOOD WAY TO SAVE CLOVER SEED. Have a wire screen at or 
near the bottom of the trough in which cattle feed on clover ; the 
pulling of it will cause the seed to fall through into the receptacle 
below, when the sieve can be removed and the pure seed obtained 
for future use. 

To MEASURE CORX IN THE Cam. This rule will apply to a crib 
of any size or kind. Two cubic feet of good, sound, dry corn in the 
ear willl make a bushel of shelled corn; to get, then, the quantity of 
shelled corn in a crib of corn in the ear, multiply the length, breadth, 
heighth of the crib inside of the rail; multiply the length by the 
breadth and the product by the heighth, then divide the product by 
two and you will have the number of bushels of shelled corn in the 
crib. 

To ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF HAY IN A Mow. A hog and stock 
grower says that the following rule has proved correct. In a mow, 
allow 512 cubic feet for a ton in hay measurement 

To ARREST CHINCH-BUG DEPREDATIONS. Take a pail of water 
and 1-2 gallon of salt stir well; then, with a small broom or bunch 
of feathers, sprinkle well a row of corn just ahead of the bugs, taking 
care that the ground between the hills of corn in said row is well 
sprinkled with the brine. 3 pails of brine will sprinkle a quarter of a 
mile if properly applied, and will stop the march of that crop destroy- 
ing insect, for they generally commence on one side of a field and 
never stop till they have reached the last row. They march in bodies 
with army precision. 

To DESTROY BUGS. To drive away the striped bugs from cu- 
cumber, melon or potato vines ; take i peck of hen-house manure to 
every i 1-2 gallon of water, make a strong solution and let it stand a 
day and night. If you have one, use a sprinkler and sprinkle the 
solution over the plants after sunset 



THE FARM. 453 

CATCHING BUGS. Suggested by a French herbaculturist After 
sunset place in the center of the orchard an old barrel, the inside of 
which has previously been well tarred ; at the bottom of the barrel 
place a lighted lamp. Insects of many kinds, attracted by the light, 
make for the lamp, and while circling around it, strike against the 
sides of the barrel, when, meeting with the tar, their wings and legs 
become so clogged that they fall helpless to the bottom. In the 
morning examine the barrel, and you may often take out 10 or 12 
gallons of cock-chafers, which can be destroyed at once by pouring in 
boiling water. A few cents worth of tar employed in this way will, 
without any further trouble, be the means of destroying innumerable 
swarms of these insects, whose larvae are the most destructive pests 
the gardener or farmer has to contend against. 

MUSK MELONS. As soon as the runners show the fruit blossom- 
ing buds, pinch them out ; this will cause an increased production of 
the lateral shoots and add to the size of the shoots. In gardens, 
thinning the fruit and placing bits of slate or blackened shingles un- 
der each fruit, improves its size and flavor. Cucumbers, melons, 
water melons, pumpkins or squash should not grow together on ac- 
count of the mixture of the pollen. 

COWS. 

IMPORTANCE OF CLEAN WATER FOR Cows. Impure water not 
only taints the blood, but the milk also, and fever, nay, even fatal 
epidemics may originate from the drinking of foul water by the cows. 
Investigations go to prove that not only the cow, but persons, may 
be poisoned in this way, and no stock should be allowed to drink 
from a foul, stagnant pool, and it is just as important for the milk 
producing cows to have sound food and pure water as human 
beings. 

CATTLE CHOKED. To Relieve. Make the animal jump over as 
high a fence or gate as you can. and when she reaches the ground 
on the opposite side the obstruction will be ejected. 

MEASURES ro PREVENT THE EXTENSION OF DISEASE AMONG CAT- 
TLE. Among the most prominent measures, is the removal and de- 
struction by burning or burying all matters capahL of reproducing 
the disease, hence, all articles which have been in contact with dis- 
eased animals, or any of its discharges, must be regarded as infec- 
tives ; animals diseased should at once be removed or better be 
killed and deeply buried. In order to maintain or restore the health 
of cattle, these should be furnished abundance of pure air, dry, 
clean, well ventilated sheds, and plenty of pure water, clean and dry 
meadows or pasture, frequent currying and washing of the skin, 



454 



THE FARM. 



proper food at proper intervals, protection from inclement weather. 
The utmost cleanliness in the removal of offensive matter, with its 
storage a great distance from the cattle shed. 

CURE FOR DISTEMPER AMONG CATTLE. Use the Indian turnip ; 
dose for a cow or horse i turnip ; 1-2 turnip for a dog, always finely 
pulverized; give the turnip in bran or meal fur cattle or horses ; give 
to the dog in bread or rnush. It will render a perfect cure. 

CALVES should have an abundance of nr.tticious food, and while 
they may still be allowed to run out during the warm days, should 
be carefully housed at night during the rainy season. 

SCOURS IN CALVKS. Break the shells off i pint of red oak acorns, 
steep in 3 pints of water thoroughly, and you will have i quart of 
the tea ; give one pint of the same, warm, for the first dose, and the 
remainder 12 hours after, if necessary. Not more than two doses 
are required for a cure. 

HOOF ROT IN CATTLE. i 1-2 tablespoonfuls of copperas, i tea- 
cupful of the strongest vinegar, 2 tablespoonfuls of salt. Dissolve 
gradually on a hot stove, but do not let it boil. When cool, apply it 
on the affected part, limb or hoof, and also swab out the mouth of 
the animal with the mixture. 2 or 3 applications generally effect a 
cure. This preparation can be used in the foot and mouth disease, 
in connection with the above treatment. 

Cows should rest before they are milked, and cow-herders should 
not drive them rapidly to the stalls or pens. 

SWELLED BAGS IN Cows. When occasioned by cold, use or apply 
.1-2 oz. gum camphor, 2 oz. sweet oil; pulverize the cold gum, and 
dissolve over a slow fire. 

SICKNESS IN ANIMALS. A teacupful of pow^^d charcoal in water 
for a cow. 

Cows, ABORTION IN. Give them rest in a dry place, with good 
water and plenty of pure food. It may be expensive, but a gain in 
the end. 

BLOODY MILK IN Cows. A tablespoonful of sulphur in a little dry 
bran once a day ; twice a day in bad cases. 

CATTLE, WARTS ON. Anoint, once in 4 or 5 days, the warts with 
an equal mixture of blue vitroil, lard and honey. 

CURE FOR MURRAIN. Take alum and salt 1-4 Ib. each ; dissolve 
in water and give the cow. 

MANGE. 20 grains of antimony, 3 spoons of aloes, made into a 
ball with honey or molasses ; repeat ten days after the effects of the 
first dose have subsided. 1-2 oz. spirits of turpentine mixed with a 
pint of linseed oil, administered as an injection, is also a very efficient 
remedy for pin worms. 

REMEDY FOR BLOAT IN CATTLE. As soon as seen give it a pint of 



THE FARM. 455 

salt with two teaspoonfuls of salaratus mixed in it. The salt dis- 
solves the "green food, and the salaratus dispels the wind. Oat 
cakes and salt are good. 

OINTMENT FOR VERMIN ON CATTLE. i oz. red percipite, i oz. of 
roll or flowers of sulphur, 4 oz. of lard to each animal. Mix well. 

BRIMSTONE FOR TICKS. A piece of brimstone as large as a grain 
of corn, well pulverized, given in a little salt, will cause the ticks to 
drop off and prevent others from getting on for eight or ten days. 
In summer it is considered as necessary for a cow as salt. 

GORGET IN MILCH Cows. i. Cut up the roots of " sooke " or 
" pigeon berry, " and give two tablespoonfuls in bran or meal twice 
a day for two or three days ; then omit the root for the same 
length of time. Repeat until cured. 

2. Give i oz. of pulverized saltpetre in a bran mush once a day 
for 2 or 3 days. Repeat as in No. i. 

3. Give seven drops of tincture of aconite, dropped on a piece 
of bread, and fed in a bran mush for 2 or 3 days. Repeat as in 
No. i. 

4. Give in same manner as in No. 3, 1-2 teaspoonful of tincture 
of aconite root. This is not the same as the " tincture aconite " in 
No. 3. 

To CHOOSE A GOOD Cow. Her head should be small and short, 
dished in the face and sunk between the eyes, soft and loose skin, 
like that on a dog ; deep from the loin to the udder and a very slim 
tail. A cow with these marks never fails to be a good[milker. Avoid 
the Roman nose ; this indicates thin milk, and but little of it. 

CHOOSING Cows. A smooth, plump udder and slight, round teat 
will generally be o give more and better milk than a large, 

hanging udder. Th: lodging place of a cow should be clean, dry 
and warm. The floor should slope a little, the trough kept clean 
and free from sour grains, vegetables, &c. She should be regularly 
fed at sunrise and sunset, and once or twice a day besides, her best 
food good, fresh grass, upon which she should be allowed to graze, 
or be brought to her ; should be allowed to exercise in the open air. 

THE grass will go farther, her diet occasionally varied with cab- 
bages. 

DRY earth a bedding for cattle to the depth of 3 inches and the 
litter laid on it. It will not have to be renewed in along time, while 
of it a valuable manure will be formed. 

FOOD FOR MILCH Cows. When grass is neither abundant nor 
nutricious, give the cows all they will eat, night and morning, of a 
mixture of i quart of corn meal to a bushel of chopped oat straw 
or clover hay. If they do not eat more than 1-2 a bushel each of 
the mixture at a meal, you can double the portion of meal to ad- 



456 THE FARM. 

vantage. Moisten the hay, sprinkle the corn meal with a small por- 
tion of salt and stir until mixed thoroughly. 

MILKING IN SILENCE. It has been ascertained that cows will not 
give down their milk so well while talking is going on. 

LEAVES of the grape vine are excellent for cows, sheep and hogs 
when other food is scarce. 

A TEST FOR PURE MILK. Let a drop fall on the thumb nail ; if 
the milk is pure it will not spread, but if not it will with the slight- 
est motion of the hand. This I was told by a dairyman. 

THE NEW MILK TEST. Prof. Doresmus. Place a small portion 
in a vessel on the top of a stove which contains a portion of strong 
fruit vinegar or citric acid, or acetic acid and common alkali, or it is 
best to bring the milk gradually to the boiling point, then pour into 
it the acid and alkali. When these ingredients are thoroughly mixed 
the milk will separate into coagulations of olein and cascine. If 
the milk is pure no water to speak of will be found in the can, but 
if it has been watered, there will be a large deposit of water. This 
milk should not be used, but thrown away. All adulterated milk is 
unsatisfactory in its results. This is an infallible test of pure milk, 
and entirely reliable as well as convenient and simple for the house- 
keeper. 

To PREVENT MILK FROM TURNING SOUR. In warm weather allow 
2 tablespoonfuls of borax to every 4 gallons milk before straining. 
It will improve the quality and quantity of the butter. 

MILK, TO KEEP SWEET THE HOTTEST WEATHER. Put a spoonful 
of horseradish in a pan of milk. This will keep milk sweet any- 
where for several days. 

MUSTARD TASTE IN MILK, TO REMOVE. A California dairyman 
says if a very small piece of saltpetre be dropped into a pail of milk 
that it will neutralize the taste of mustard so completely that it will 
not be tasted in the butter. 

MILK being a great absorbant, takes in all flavors and smells. 

CAUSES OF ODOR IN MILK ROOM. Improper substances in the 
vicinity of milk and butter will taint them. A piece of veal on the 
cellar floor, a small portion of stagnant water, a kerosene lamp used 
in the milk room, a piece of soap left on a pan cover, coal in an 
ordinary county store, decaying vegetables, putrid animal matter in 
a cow pasture, cows drinking filthy water, partially decomposed milk, 
cream or cheese adhering to the dairy vessel on the floor or shelves. 

To PRESERVE MILK FOR A JOURNEY. Put the fresh, sweet milk 
into bottles, put them in an oven with cold water, gradually raise 
it to the boiling point, take them out and cork immediately ; return 
the bottles to the water, raise it once more to the boiling point, let 
the bottles remain a few minutes ; take the oven from the fire and 
let the bottles cool in it. 



THE FARM. 457 

CANNED MILK. St. Louis recipe. New milk may be canned as 
easily as fruit, by simply heating it to the boiling point. Pour it 
into cans and seal up. It is excellent for babies and travelling 
parties. 

CREAM, TO RISE. Strain your milk into shallow pans holding 5 
quarts, then put into each pan a quart of cold water, then strain 
into each 3 quarts of the fresh milk, and the cream will rise rap- 
idly, and in the course of a day or night remove the cream, and the 
butter made from it will be much sweeter than in the ordinary way, 
and more of it. 

To TAKE MILK FROM CREAM. Use a syphon and draw off^the milk 
from beneath the surface of the cream. This mode is very simple. 
A glass syphon will do. 

To PRESERVE CREAM A LONG TIME. Evaporate the cream as the 
milk in the foregoing recipe, only reducing it by evaporation to 1-4 
its former bulk without adding sugar, then preserve it in bottles as 
directed for milk. The bottles containing the cream should be 
boiled 3-4 of an hour. 

To PRESERVE CREAM SWEET. Dissolve 3.4 pound of white sugar 
in as little water as possible, after which boil it in an enameled 
kettle or sauce pan and immediately add 3-4 pound of new cream, 
mixing the whole while hot. Let it cool gradually and pour it 
into bottles, which must be carefully corked ; keep in a cool place, 
and it will be good for weeks. 

A SUBSTITUTE FOR MILK OR CREAM. Beat up the whole of a 
fresh egg in a basin, and then pour boiling tea or coffee over it, stir- 4 
ring gradually to prevent curdling. 

CLOTH STRAINER FOR MILK Is greatly superior to those of wire. 

ASSES' MILK. So sustaining to consumptives far surpasses in nu- 
trition any imitation of it that can be made. It should be milked 
into a glass that is kept warm by being in a basin of hot water. The 
fixed air that it contains gives some people a pain in the stom- 
ach. At first a teaspoonful of rum may be taken with it, but 
should only be put in the moment it is swallowed. 

ARTIFICIAL ASSES' MILK. Boil together a quart of water, the 
same of new milk, an ounce of white sugar candy, 1-2 ounce of 
eringo root, 1-2 ounce of conserve of roses till 1-2 wasted. This 
is astringent, therefore proportion the doses to the effect, and the 
quantity that will be used while sweet. 



458 THE DAIRY. 



THE DAIRY. 

BEEKMAN, in his "History of Inventions," states that butter was 
not used by either the Greeks or Romans, nor was it brought upon 
their tables at certain meals, as is the present custom. In England 
butter has been made from time immemorial, but the art of making 
cheese was learned from their conquerors, it being unknown to the 
ancient Britons. 

BUTTER, THE TARTAR METHOD TO PRESERVE AND CURE. P. K . 
Melt the butter in well glazed earthen pans at a heat not exceed- 
ing 1 80 degrees, in a water bath, and keep it heated, skimming it 
from time to time, until the butter becomes quite transparent ; then 
pour off the clear into another vessel and cool it as quickly as possi- 
ble, by surrounding it with water or ice. 

REMARKS. The above is the method of preserving butter by the 
Tartars, who supply the Constantinople market; and if kept in a 
close vessel and in a cool, dry place, will keep perfectly sweet for 6 
months. 

MR. EATON REMARKS that butter, melted by the Tartarian method 
and then salted by ours, will keep good and. fine tasted for 2 years ; 
that is by using i oz. of salt petre and white sugar, and 2 oz. of the 
best rock salt (in a very fine powder), well mixed together. When 
put up, it should be packed so closely together that no vacuum will 
be left, and Mr. Anderson declares that butter so packed, will keep 
in a cool place for years, and if packed so as not to melt, will stand 
a voyage to the East Indies. 

N. B. The Tartarian method, as above discribed, will keep but- 
ter longer than any other yet discovered. 

BUTTER, RUSSIAN MANNER. The sweet milk is gently simmered 
for 1-4 hour, then churned in the usual manner. 

SWEDISH MODE OF MAKING BUTTER. Consists simply in setting 
milk in deep cans, about 7 1-2 inches in diameter by 20 inches long, 
and placing them in a tub of water filled with broken ice, so as to 
maintain a temperature as near to 40 degrees as possible, and in 
taking off the first 12 hours cream for their export butter. This is 
churned immediately at a temperature of from 50 to 60 degrees, 
freed from buttermilk and packed in sealed tin cans holding 4 and 8 
pounds. Thus made and prepared, it will remain sweet indefinitely. 
The milk after the first skimming is made into cheese or remains 
until the cream has risen, and made into butter, known as the 
"seconds," used for home and domestic use. The Swedes claim 
that by taking off the cream containing the large globules, which 
first rise, a more solid and firmer butter can be made ; at the same 



THE DAIRY. 459 

time it is freed from the influences of the atmosphere and the germs 
of decay floating therein. Certain it is, that, whereas the country was 
famous for producing the poorest butter of any in Europe, it now, 
under this system, produces the finest butter in the world. 

IT WAS DURING the fourth century before the Christian era, that 
butter began to be noticed as an aliment. The Parthians and Cy- 
thyans often sent it to the Greeks, who had it served on their table in 
imitation of the people from whom they obtained it, and gave it the 
name of "oil of milk," and later, that of "cow cheese." 

THE IRISH RECIPE TO SALT BUTTER. To i Ib. of common salt, 
add i Ib. of saltpetre and 1-4 Ib. of white sugar; pound all these to- 
gether, mixing them well, and to every pound of butter allow i oz. 
of the mixture ; make it as fresh as you want it, observing to be very 
careful always to keep the same proportions and to mix the ingredi- 
ents thoroughly. The butter should stand a month before you use 
it. 

To FRESHEN SALT BUTTER. Dissolve the butter in hot water ; 
after cooling, strain off the butter from the water and churn it in 
sweet milk ; allow i quart of milk for i Ib of butter. Be careful to 
have the water hot enough to melt the butter. 

To PRESERVE BUTTER. Take. 2 parts of the best common salt, i 
part of good loaf sugar; and i part of salt petre ; beat them well to- 
gether. To 1 6 oz. of butter, thoroughly cleansed from the milk, put 
i oz. of the composition ; work it well and pot down ; when it becomes 
firm and cold, the butter thus preserved is the better for keeping, 
and should not be used under a month. This article should be kept 
from the air, and is best in pots of the best glazed earth, that will 
hold from 12 to 14 Ibs. each. 

To PRESERVE BUTTER FOR WINTER USE. THE BEST WAV. When 
the butter has been prepared as above described, take 2 parts of the 
best common salt, i part of good common loaf sugar, and i part of 
salt petre; beaten and blended well together ; of this composition 
put i oz. to 1 6 ozs. of butter and work it well together in a mass. 
Press it into the pans after the butter becomes cool, for friction, 
though it be not touched by the hands, will soften it. The pans 
should hold from 10 to 12 Ibs. each. On the top put some salt, and 
when it has turned into brine, (if not enough to cover the butter en- 
tirely), add some strong salt and water. It requires only to be cov- 
ered from the dust. 

PATENT BUTTER. Mr. Clark's Recipe. Wash the butter and press 
out the milk in the usual way, then place it between t.vo linen cloths 
and submit it to severe pressure to remove the whey; coat clean 
white paper on both sides with the whites of eggs, mixing 15 grains 
of salt to each white; dry the paper, and just before wrapping it

around the butter, iron it with a hot iron ; use it heated. Keep in a 
cool, dry place. 

To KEEP AND CHOOSE FRESH BUTTER. Fresh butter should be 
kept in a dark, cool place, and in as large a mass as possible. 
Mould as much only as is required, as the more surface is exposed, 
the more liability there will be to spoil, and the outside becomes ran- 
sid. Fresh butter should be covered with white paper. For small 
larders butter coolers, of red brick are now very much used for keep- 
ing fresh butter in warm weather. The coolers are made with a large 
bell-shaped cover, in the top of which a little cold water should be 
poured, and in summer time very frequently changed ; the butter 
mi'st be kept covered. These coolers keep butter remarkably firm 
in hot weatiier, and are extremely convenient for those whose larder 
accommodation is limited. In choosing fresh butter, remember that 
it should smell deliciously and be of equal color all through ; if it 
smell sour, it has not been sufficiently washed from the buttermilk, 
and if veiny and open, it has probably been worked with a staler or 
an inferior sort. When buying it in casks, you can test its goodness 
by unhooping it and trying it between the staves. To choose salt 
butter, plunge a knife into it, and if, when drawn out, the blade 
smells rancid or unpleasant, the butter is bad. Bad butter is inju- 
rious to the stomach and almost poisonous, disguise it as you may, 
and never allow it to enter into composition of any dish that appears 
on your table. 

To PURIFY RANCID BUTTER. Melt and skim the butter as you 
would for clarifying and then put into it some billets of toasted bread. 
In a few minutes the butter will lose its offensive smell, but the bread 
will become fetid. Or, use Darby's Profalectic fluid, by the direc- 
tions which accompany each bottle. 

To CUT BUTTER INTO PATS. Lay the butter, already moulded, in 
ice water, then, when cold and firm, cut it with a sharp knife dipped 
in hot water, and throw the pats into a pan of ice water ; then, when 
wanted, put on small plates. 

^ How TO M 'KK BUTTER TO RESEMBLE A PINE APPLE IN FORM. 
Centennial. With a butter paddle make the butter in the form of a 
real pine apple, then take a silver teaspoon, dip the handle in hot 
water, then in cold ; while the spoon is warm and wet, scrape up 
enough of the butter around the side to form a fluted bar, then another 
all around; then above this make another row, not having them in the 
same line, and then continue to the top. It should be done on the 
butter plate and in extremely cold weather, otherwise it will melt and 
spoil. 

To MAKE STACKS OF BUTTER FOR ORNAMENT AT LARGE PARTIES. 
Centennial. Make a stand of butter about i 1-2 feet or higher on 



THE DAIRY. 461 

a butter plate, then take a thin coarse cotton or linen stocking and 
squeeze butter through over the stack of butter. The butter passing 
through the stocking net will resemble fringe or fine straw, which is 
very ornamental and will stick to the butter stack. Or, the butter 
can be colored in different ways if desired ; I mean that which is 
squeezed through the net. 

N. B. This can be made only in very cold weather, and even 
then, a fire will cause it to melt and mar its beauty. 

DUCKS OR ANY KIND OF FOWL MADE OF BUTTER, ON A DlSH OR 

PLATE. Centennial. Then squeeze the butter through the net as 
before described. The little threads will resemble feathers. The 
dish is beautiful as well as ornamental. These dishes were made 
and used at weddings and parties by our revolutionary grandmothers. 
I know this, for I have the good fortune to remember my great-grand- 
mother with matrons of the same stamp in her day. 

FAIRY BUTTER. The yolks of 2 hard boiled eggs, i tablespoonful 
of orange flower water; 2 spoonfuls of pounded sugar, 1-4 Ib. of good 
fresh butter. Beat the yolks of the eggs smoothly in a mortar with 
the orange flower water and sugar until the whole is reduced to a fine 
paste ; add the butter and force all through an old but clean cloth by 
wringing the cloth and squeezing the butter very hard. The butter 
will then drop on the plate in large and small pieces, according to 
the holes in the cloth. Plain buttermaybe done in the same man- 
ner, and is very quickly prepared, besides having a very good effect. 

BUTTER, BRINE FOR PRESERVING. German mode. Make three 
gallons of brine strong enough to bear an egg, to this add 4 spoon- 
fuls (heaped) of white pounded sugar and i teaspoonful of salt- 
petre pounded. Boil the brine, take off, and strain carefully when 
cold, then make your butter into rolls of the desired weight, then 
with clean white muslin wrap each roll separately. Pack in a large 
jar, hogshead or cask ; press the butter down, then pour, on the 
brine till more than covered, and it will keep sweet and fresh for an 
entire year. If you wish to keep your butter for any length of time, 
never put it near ice. If the weather is too hot to make the butter 
into rolls, pack it closely in small jars to the depth of at least four 
inches. This will exclude the air, and will answer nearly as well as 
the freezing method. 

To MAKE BUTTER QUICKLY. Soyer, in his history of food, says 
that to obtain butter instantly it is only necessary in summer to put 
new milk into a bottle, some hours after it has been taken from 
the cow and shake briskly. The clots thus formed should be thrown 
into a sieve or a clean cloth and pressed together, and they consti- 
tute the purest, most delicate and delicious butter that can possibly 
be made, and I know the most relished by sick persons.

DIFFERENT CHEESES HOW TO MAKE. 

CHEESE FROM LABBERED MILK. Set the thick milk on the top of 
the stove where it will gradually scald ; stir gently now and then. 
It should not be allowed to boil, as that makes the curd too hard 
and dry. When it is cooked so tha't the curd will keep its shape 
after being squeezed in the hand it is done. Pour it into a colan- 
der to let the whey drain off, and when cool enough to handle press 
it in the hands to get out the remainder of the whey, then to a quart 
of curd take a spoonful of butter, 3 spoonfuls of sweet cream, a tea- 
spoonful of salt and mix it well together, then make it into cakes 
or press it all in a dish together and cut it with a knife when wanted. 
This is liked much. 

MAKING DUTCH CHEESE IN OHIO FASHION. Take some sweet 
milk in a new tin pail or pan, set it on a stove, shaking it occasion- 
ally that the curd may not settle at the bottom; then to form evenly 
gently turn in the edges, taking care not to break the curds, and not 
to let it cook too fast. If of the proper temperature it will be done 
in 1-2 hour. Then slowly and gently drain off the whey, pressing 
the curd till only enough whey remains in it to prevent the cheese 
from being too dry, with just enough to mix it well ; then add salt 
to taste, a good lump of sweet new butter, and work well with the 
hand, then pack down in a crock, leaving all the moisture in it. 
This is better than to press it in dry balls ; set away in a cool place 
or spring house. When preparing it for table take it out into a deep 
white dish and very carefully dip out and lay over the top of it a 
few spoonfuls of thick cream, sweet or sour, but the sour is prefera- 
ble; lay a clean, bright spoon beside the dish, and the wholesome 
practical dish is ready for criticism cold and white and pretty, and 
one of the nicest dishes known for tea. 

COTTAGE CHEESES. Mrs. L. M. Kellogg. Put your clabber on a 
moderate stove or fire, let it heat slqjvly, then strain the whey off 
through a cloth or fine colander till dry, then with your hand work 
it till soft, with some sweet butter and salt added; then make into 
small balls for the table. Eat with buttered bread. 

IN CHOOSING CHEESE. The sense of smell is less easily imposed 
on than the palate. 

To PRESERVE SOUND CHEESE. Wash and wipe it with whey once 
a month and keep it on a rack. If you want to ripen it, place it in 
a damp cellar. When a whole cheese is cut, the larger quantity 
should be spread with butter on the side and the coat wiped. To 
keep what is used moist, wrap around it a cloth that has been wrung 
out in cold water. Dry cheese may be advantageously eaten by 



THE DAIRY. 463 

grating it with or without maccaroni and spread on bread with but- 
ter. Some cheeses are highly colored with annatto, which is per- 
fectly harmless, but as many persons use red lead for cheapness, 
families would do well to avoid purchasing cheese which has that 
appearance. It is said of dealers who, in order to give a blue mould 
to their cheese, have inserted into them pieces of copper or brass, 
the consequence of which have, in some instances, been fatal, for 
the dainty morsel thus produced is verdigris. 

MAKING CHEESE. A genuine Scotch recipe. Take 2 tablespoon- 
fuls of Irish potatoes boiled and mashed to 10 pounds of milk curd; 
after the cheese is pressed aud dried in the mould, then remove it 
without wrapping it up ; put it in among the hay in a hay stack and 
let it remain a year, then it is fit for table use. The cheese will be 
variegated with yellow and green colors. It is as wholesome as 
delicious. Water from sage, parsley, cresses and other herbs boiled 
and put in the milk curd makes it better and more wholesome, being 
nice and spicy. 

CHEESE. Put the cream that has been produced in the night into 
the morning's milk with the rennet, but the curd, instead of being 
broken, is to be taken out all together. Place it on a sieve, and 
while draining gradually keep gently pressing it till it has acquired a 
consistency ; then place it in a wooden hoop and press it dry on 
boards, turning it frequently, and bind a cloth around it, tightening 
the same as occasion requires. In some dairies the cheese, after 
being taken out of the hoop, is bound tight around with a cloth, 
which is changed every day until the cheese stands in need of no 
further support. After taking off the cloth it must be brushed every 
day for 2 or 3 months with a brush, and when the weather is damp 
this should be done twice a day. 

SOUR CREAM CHEESE. Take a pint of very thick sour cream 
from the top of the pan forgathering butter; lay a napkin on 2 plates 
and pour 1-2 into each; let them stand 12 hours, then put them on 
a fresh wet napkin in one plate and cover the same. This do every 
12 hours until you find the cheese begins to look dry, then ripen it 
with sage leaves. It will be ready in 10 days. Two pewter plates will 
ripen cream cheese very well. 

To MAKE SAGE CHEESE. Bruise the tops of red sage in a mortar 
with some leaves of spinach and squeeze the juice; mix it with ren- 
net in the milk, more or less, according as you like for color and 
taste. When the curd is come break it gently and put it in with the 
skimmer until it is pressed 2 inches above the pot. Press it 8 or 10 
hours ; salt it and turn it every day. 

MACCARONI AS USUALLY SERVED WITH THE CHEESE COURSE. 1-4 
pound of pipe raaccaroni, 1-2 pint of brown gravy and 6 ounces of 



464 THE DAIRY. 

rich cheese grated. Wash the maccaroni and boil it in salt and 
water until quite tender; drain it, and put it in rather a deep dish ; 
have ready a pint of good brown gravy, pour it hot over the mac- 
caroni and send it to table with grated cheese served 
in a separate dish. When the flavor is liked, a little pounded 
mace may be added to the water in which the macaroni is 
boiled, but this must alwys be sparingly added, as it will impart 
a strong flavor. One and one-half to i 3-4 hour to boil the macca- 
roni. Seasonable at any time. 

TOASTED CHEESE OR WELSH RARE BIT. Slices of bread and but- 
ter, rich cheese, mustard and pepper. Cut the bread in thin slices 
about 1-2 inch thick and pare off the crust; toast the bread slightly 
without hardening or burning it, and spread it with butter; cut some 
slices not quite so large as the bread from a good, rich, fat cheese; 
lay them on the toasted bread in a cheese-toaster; be careful that 
the cheese does not burn, and let it be equally melted. Spread over 
the top a little made mustard and a seasoning of pepper and serve 
very hot with very hot plates. To facilitate the melting of the 
cheese, it may be cut into thin flakes or toasted on one side before 
it is laid on the bread. As it is so essential to" send this dish hot to 
the table it is a good plan to melt the cheese in small, round silver 
or metal pans, and to send these pans to table, allowing one for 
each guest; slices of dry or buttered toast should always accompany 
them, with mustard, pepper and salt. Five minutes to melt the 
cheese. Allow a slice to each person. Seasonable at all times. 

N. B. Should the cheese be dry, a little butter mixed with it will 
be an improvement. 

TOASTED CHEESE OR SCOTCH RARE BIT. A few slices -of cheese, 
toast, mustard and pepper. Cut some nice rich, sound cheese 
into rather thin slices, melt it in a cheese toaster on a hot plate 
or over steam, and when melted, add a small quantity of mixed 
mustard and a seasoning of pepper. Stir the cheese until it is 
completely dissolved, then brown it before the fire or with a sala- 
mander. Fill the bottom of the cheese-toaster with hot water and 
serve with dry or buttered toasts, whichever may be preferred. 
A small quantity of porter or port wine is sometimes mixed with 
the cheese, and if it be not very rich, a few pieces of butter may 
be mixed with great advantage. Sometimes the melted cheese is 
spread on toasts, and then laid on the cheese dish at the top of 
the hot water. Whichever way it is served it is highly necessary 
that the mixture be very hot and very quickly sent to table, or it will 
be worthless. Five minutes to melt the cheese. Allow a slice for 
each person. Seasonable at any time. 

CHEESE CAKKS. Turn a gallon of sweet milk with some fresh 



THE DAIRY. 465 

rennet, as for cheese; drain it. When dry crumble it fine and shake 
it through a coarse sieve into a basin ; then beat it well with 4 ozs. 
of butter or more. If the milk is not rich, then mix together in an- 
other basin the beaten yolks of 4 eggs, 4 ounces of cracker powder 
sifted, the juice of 2 lemons and the grated rinds of 4 ; 4 ounces of 
pounded white sugar, some powdered cinnamon or nutmeg grated. 
Beat these up well together until perfectly smooth, forming a stiff 
cream, then add slowly with the curd in the basin; then mix again 
well together, then butter some small tart pans and line them with 
some puff paste, put some of the butter in each and bake in a 
quick oven. 

N. B. If you have no rennet to turn your good milk, use the 
juice of i lemon or a teaspoonful of soda or culinary alkali to 
each quart of milk. You should drain this curd well, as before. 
Some persons do not use any eggs, but good, sweet milk instead. 
BRKAD CHEESE CAKES. Melt 6 ounces of butter in a pint of new 
milk and pour it hot over i Ib. of bread crumbs ; let it stand to be 
quite cold, then add 6 ozs. currants, 6 ozs. sugar, 1-4 oz. of grated 
nutmeg; beat all quite smooth with the yolks of 8 and whites of 5 
eggs. Add, if you choose, a glass of brandy; bake in patty -pans 
lined with paste for 20 minutes. These cheese cakes are as good as 
those of curd. 

RENNET. The Bavarian way, consists in turning out the con- 
tents of the skin of the stomach, wiping off all the specks or dirt with 
a cloth, then blowing up the skin and filling it with air like a blad- 
der; the ends are tied with a string and a little salt applied to this 
part only. The skin treated in this way, soon dries perfectly and is 
sweet as could be desired. This way is preferable to the common 
one; it keeps better, can be folded up and carried anywhere. 

RENNET. 2 square inches from the bottom of the calve's stomach 
are sufficient for a cheese of 60 Ibs. 

RENNET WINE. Rub the salt from the calve's stomach and put 
it into a bottle and fill it up with good Madeira wine. A substitute 
for rennet is the juice of a lemon or a teaspoonful of soda to a quart 
of milk. A tablespoonful of rennet wine is sufficient for 2 quarts of 
milk ; put in when warm. 

CHEESE AND ALE. Cut some good, rich cheese into thin slices, 
carefully removing the rind, lay them in a dish over a lamp ; spread 
each piece with mustard and pour over as much ale as will cover 
them ; stew till the cheese is quite dissolved. Toast and ale should 
be served with this ; the toast should be thick and well browned, and 
hot ale, with or without spices, poured over it. 

BOILED CHEESE. Four ounces of good, rich cheese, 2 oz. of fresh 
butter and a tablespoonful of cream ; cut the cheese into thin slices, 



466 THE DAIRY. 

put all into a stew-pan and set it over a slow fire, stir it till it boils 
and is quite smooth. Take off the pan, break an egg into it, stir 
both yolk and white quickly in ; put it into a dish and brown in a 
Dutch oven before the fire. 

STEWED CHEESE. Melt a tablespoonful of butter in a cupful of 
cream, mix with a good teaspoonful of rich, good cheese, finely grat- 
ed; beat it well together, stew it till quite smooth, stirring all the 
time. Serve it on well toasted bread and brown the top with a sal- 
amander. 

CURD FOR CHEESE CAKES. English Recipe. Four cups each of 
water and sour milk, 2 beaten eggs, 2 tablespoonfuls of fruit vinegar 
or lemon juice ; boil the water in a pan, then mix the milk and beat- 
en eggs together, add them to the water and stir in the vinegar or 
lemon juice ; when the curd forms, lay it on a cloth or sieve to drain. 
Boil slowly till it curds. 

CHEESE OR CURD CAKE. D. C. One quart of curd squeezed dry, 
1-2 Ib. of butter, 1-2 Ib. of sugar, the whites of 3 eggs, i teacupfulof 
currants or Sultana raisins cut in halves, and spice to your taste. 
When light, put into your paste in small pans. 

RAMAKINS. To serve with the cheese course. One half pound 
of rich, good cheese, 1-4 Ib. of fresh butter, 4 eggs, the crumb of a 
small roll ; pepper, salt and pounded mace to taste. Boil the crumbs 
of the roll in milk for 5 minutes, strain and put it into a mortar ; add 
the cheese, which should be finely scraped; the butter, the yolks of 
the eggs and seasoning, and pound these ingredients well together. 
Whisk the whites of the eggs, mix them with the paste and put it in- 
to small pans or frames, which should not be more than half filled. 
Bake from 10 to 12 minutes and serve them very hot and quickly. 
This batter answers equally well for maccaroni after it is boiled ten- 
der, 10 to 12 minutes. Seasonable at any time. 

To MAKE A FONDUE. Four eggs, the weight of 2 in good, rich 
cheese, the weight of 2 in butter ; pepper and salt to taste. Separ- 
ate the yolks from the whites of the eggs, beat the former in a basin 
and grate the cheese or cut it in thin flakes. Any good, rich, sound 
cheese may be used, whichever is most convenient. Break the but- 
ter into small pieces and add it to the other ingredients with enough 
pepper and salt to season nicely, and beat the mixture thoroughly. 
Well whisk the whites of the eggs, stir them lightly in, and either 
bake the fondue in a souffle dish or small round cake tin. Fill the 
dish only 1-2 full, as the fondue should rise very much. Pin a nap- 
kin round the dish and serve very hot and very quickly. If it is al- 
lowed to stand after it is withdrawn from the oven, the beauty and 
lightness of this composition will be entirely spoiled. From xoto 12 
minutes. Seasonable at any time.

HORSES AND THEIR DISEASES. 

How TO JUDGE A HORSE. If the color be light sorrel or chestnut 
the feet, legs and face white, these are marks of kindness. If he be 
broad and full between the eyes, you may depend pn him as a horse 
of good sense, capable of being trained to anything. As respects 
such horses, the more kindly you treat them the better you will be 
treated in return, nor will a horse of this discription stand a whip 
if well fed. If you want a safe horse, avoid one that is dish faced. 
He may be so far gentle as not to scare, but he will have too much 
go ahead in him to be safe with every body. If you want a fool of a 
horse, but of great bottom, get a deep bay, with not a white hair 
about him. If his face is a little dished, so much the worse. Let no 
man ride such a horse that is not an adept in riding, they are always 
frisky and unsafe. If you want one that will never give out, never 
buy a large overgrown one. Parti-colored horses are docile and 
gentle. 

AGE OF A HORSE. Every horse has 6 teeth above and below; 
before 3 years old he sheds his middle teeth ; at 3 he sheds i more 
on each side of the central teeth, at 4 he sheds the 2 corner and last 
of the 4 teeth. Between 4 and 5 he cuts the under tusks ; at 5 he 
will cut his upper tusks, at which time his mouth will be complete. 
At 6 the grooves and hollows begin to fill up a little ; at 7 the grooves 
will be well nigh filled up, except the corner teeth, leaving little brown 



46 > HORSES AND THEIR DISEASES. 

spots where the dark brown hollows formerly were. At 8 the whole 
of the hollows are filled up. At 9 there is often seen a small bill to 
the outside corner teeth ; the point of the tusk is worn off and the 
part that was concave begins to fill up and becomes rounding. The 
squares of the central teeth begin to disappear and the gums leave 
them small and narrow at the top. 

FOR TAMING HORSES. Kindly furnished by a gentleman who has 
had much experience in such matters. Take finely pounded castor 
and oils of rhodium and cummin ; keep these in separate bottle well 
corked. Put some of the oil of cummin on your hand and approach 
him on the windy side ; he will then move towards you ; then rub 
some of the cummin on his nose. Then give him some of the castor 
on anything he likes and put 8 or 10 drops of the rhodium on the 
end of his tongue, and you can get him to do anything you please. 
Follow this up with kindness, and your control of him is certain. 

To CURE A HORSE FROM CRIBBING. Arrange the stall so your 
horse cannot get hold of any thing only his feed trough. Now make 
2 rollers the length of the trough, 6 or 7 inches in diameter ; the 
larger the better, fasten one end in front of the other in the back 
part of the trough ; when the horse goes to cribbing, he will press his 
teeth against the rollers and they will turn; after trying it a few times 
he will give it up. 

FOUNDER REMEDY. Swab (if stiff) the feet and legs with hot wa- 
ter, so hot that the hand cannot bear to touch it, but not so hot as to 
scald. After a short time the legs should be rubbed dry and the 
horse gently exercised. A correspondent says that he has never 
known this remedy to fail. Another correspondent says that foun- 
der in its worst form can be cured by standing your horse all day in 
water deep enough to come up over his back. Running water is the 
best. 

CURE FOR SWEENY. Take a toad, noose a string around his hind 
legs, and tie it around the horse's mane, so that the toad will hang 
against the sweenied shoulder over night. By next morning the 
toad will not only be dead, but dried up like a piece of beef that has 
hung up to dry a day or two. But if it be not sweeny, it \\illbe alive 
and in a good condition. 

HIDE-BOUND HORSES. ---Nitrate of potash, 2 1-2 oz.; sulphate of 
iron, common rosin, of each 10 drachms; juniper berries, 6 oz.; all 
in powder; to be well mixed and divided into 12 parts, one of which 
is to be given night and morning in mixed feed. Or the following 
powders may be given the following week : Flowers of sulphur, i Ib. 
sesqui-sulphuret of antimony, 1-2 Ib.; powdered nitrate of potash, 
1-4 Ib. Mix and divide into 12 parts, one part to be given every 
morning and evening in mixed feed. The powders will work on the 
kidneys and secretory organs.

How TO CURE A CRACKED HOOF. When the hoof is cracked all 
the way up, cut a notch above the crack in the soft part of the hoofc 
as the hoof grows off and the notch grows down in the hard hoof, 
take a rasp and rut the notch nearly through the hoof, and a cure 
will be effected, as soon as the hoof grows out. 

CURE FOR RING BONE. Mix 1-2 oz. of odine in a 25 cents bottle 
of Mexican Mustang Liniment. 

FISTULA. If the fistula has not been opened, it should be 
fomented with hot water, as hot as the hand can bear, several 
times a day, until the tumor points or appears soft. Then a good 
large opening should be made at the most pending part of the 
tumor, in order to give the matter free exit. Keep it thoroughly 
clean by injecting soap and water every day. After using the 
soap and water, use the following injection : Solution Goulard, 2 
ounces; sulphate zinc, i ounce; sulphate copper, i ounce, and 
dilute acetic acid powder, i pint. Powder the sulphates and dis- 
solve in the diluted acetic acid and add the Goulard solution. Use 
this once a day with cleanliness. 

POLE EVIL, TO SCATTER. Bruise a quantity of the mandrake 
root and boil it down until thick, then add some lard, and then 
simmer until proper to make an ointment. Apply every day until 
well. 

RKMEDY FOR BOTS IN HORSES. It may be known by the occa- 
sional nipping at their own sides, and by red pimples and projec- 
tions on the inner surface of the upper lip, which can be plainly seen 
by raising the lip. 

THEATMENT. First give 2 quarts of new milk with i quart of 
molasses. Give the horse the whole amount; 15 minutes afterwards 
give 2 quarts of sage tea very strong ; 30 minutes after the tea 
currier's oil, or enough to operate as physic. The milk and the 
molasses will cause the bots to let go their hold, the tea puckers 
them up, and the oil carries them away. 

GLANDKRS are contagious among horses, and even persons have 
been known to take it from them. The virus or poison of glan- 
ders may be for months in a state of incubation in the horse's 
constitution before the disease breaks out. Of this we have the 
most positive evidence, and when it does it gives it to all others 
near or in contact with it. The best and safest way is to burn 
thoroughly the ground over which the animal has grazed, and per- 
haps the stable also. 

EPIZOOTIC. As soon as the disease begins to appear among 
your horses give each a large dose of pine tar once a week. 

REMEDY FOR HORSE COUGH. One pint of bran wet with wa- 
ter; put from 5 to 7 drops of tar oil in bran, stir it well and give to

the horse twice a day, morning and evening. It is good for dis- 
temper; in fact, it is good for any kind of cough ahorse may 
haVe. The tar oil can be had at any drug store. It costs but a 
trifle. 

WASH FOR SADDLE SORES ON HORSES' BACKS AND OTHER FOUL 
SORES. Calomel i drachm and 1-2 pint of water. 

GRUBS IN HORSES. R. M. Make a strong sage tea, drench the 
horse until a change is effected ; or beat the leaves and give them 
at once in some bran or meal : a cup is a dose, or once or twice a 
week. 

WORMS. First give the horse as a vermifuge i-i oz. of freshly 
powdered betel nut put in his food 2 or 3 times a week. 2nd, the 
best plan is to stimulate the horn forming tissues to increased ac- 
tion, which can be accomplished by blistering around the pastern 
and coronet. After the effects of blisters have subsided apply daily 
to the hoof by means of a stiff brush an ointment composed of 
tar, soft soap and tallow, equal parts, melted together and stirred 
till cold. The above is a remedy for worms and for one foot that 
contracts as much as the other grows. 

ASTRINGENT POWDERS FOR LOOSENESS. Alum, 1-2 oz. ; catechu, 
i ounce; opium, 1-4 ounce; chalk, 4 ounces ; ginger, 2 ounces. 
Usual dose is i to 2 tablespoonfuls per day. If preferred, they can 
be made into balls with molasses. 

LOTION FOR TENDER-MOUTHED HORSES. Powdered borax or 
alum, i ounce ; honey, 4 ounces ; infusion of roses, i pound. It 
should be used with a syringe. 

HORSE CORDIAL. One pint compound tincture of benzoin, com- 
pound spirits of ammonia and sweet spirits of nitre, of each 
6 or 8 ounces. Mix and put in closely corked bottles. 

SHEEP, AND THEIR DISEASES. 

GRUB OR FOOT-ROT IN SHEEP. Run the sheep, every other day, 
through dry, fresh slacked lime until a cure is effected. It is a never- 
failing cure. 

To PROTRCT SHEEP FROM THE GAD FLY. Which deposits in the 
months of August and September the egg in the nostrils of the 
sheep when they are hatched, and the worms crawl into the head 
of the sheep, and very frequently eat through the brain, and in this 
way destroy many sheep. As a protection, smear their noses with 
tar. Lay some tar in the trough or on a board, and strew fine 
salt on it. The sheep will finish the operation. The tar will pro- 
tect them, and what they eat will promote their health. A strong 
decoction or juice of elder leaves squirted up their noses is a

valuable remedy, and to drive any kind of fly worms, and resists 
putrifaction. 

THK GAD FLY. These, in the summer months, abound in woody 
places and attack the sheep while browsing. The moment the fly 
touches the nostrils they deposit the egg, which soon hatches, and 
the maggots crawl up the nostrils and enter the frontal and maxil- 
lary sinuses, and also the cavities of the bone which supports the 
horns of the sheep. These cavities are all of considerable extent 
and magnitude, and the thin flexible bones which constitute them 
are covered with a dense white membrane, upon the mucus secre- 
tions of which the larvae is supposed to feed. 

How TO TELL THE AGES OF SHEEP. The first year their teeth are 
small, the second year the 2 middle ones fall out, and their place is 
supplied by 2 larger new teeth ; the third year there are 4 larger 
teeth in the middle, 10 pointed ones on each side ; the fourth year 
2 smaller teeth alone remain, one at each end of the range ; the 
fifth year the whole front teeth are larger ; the 6th year the whole 
teeth begin to be worn ; the seventh year the teeth begin to fall out 
and get broken. 

HOGS AND THEIE DISEASES. 

How TO PRESERVE PIGS IN GOOD HEALTH AND IN GOOD APPETITES 

DURING THE PERIOD OF THEIR FATTENING. Mix with the food a few 

gall-nuts bruised with charcoal. 

BRIMSTONE FOR CATTLE. It is as necessary for them as salt. 

FOOD FOR HOGS. Mix with their food the wood charcoal. It 
adds greatly to their healthfulness. 

ARTICHOKES AS A FOOD. Are excellent for hogs, sheep and cattle. 

TO PREVENT HOGS FROM BITING EACH OTHER. Give them COal Ot 

burnt bones to eat. 

BLIND STAGGERS IN PIGS. Withhold food from them for several 
days, give them charcoal and sulphur in small quantities. This 
disease arises from being fed too high. 

Sows EATING PIGS. A veterinaria-i in the Prairie Farmer ad- 
vises a correspondent, to watch the hog the first few days after the 
pigs are born, if she evinces a desire to eat her pigs, give her an 
emetic compound of tartar emetic, 3 grains; powdered ipecac 
and powdered white hellebore of each 8 grains; mix and throw 
the dose into the mouth of the hog. 

DRY CHOLERA AMONG HOGS. The best remedy is green corn, 
when that is nol to be had, use from one to two tablespoonfuls of 
castor-oil mixed with scalded meal. Give a good feed but not too 
much. Pour the oil down and make a tempting slop of the meal 
and sweet milk. 



FRUITS. 

How TO RELIEVE HOGS OF LICE. Take 3 or 4 copper cents and 
nail them to the bottom of the trough in which you feed them, and the 
lice will leave. 

LICE ON CATTLE. An immediate and valuable remedy for lice on 
cows and other cattle, and likewise for pigs, is to wash the affected 
parts in potato- water or water in which potatoes have been boiled. 
One application will do. 

KIDNEY WORM PARALYSIS IN SWINE (Tautun Xaroral). With a 
light piece of board, strike the hog several times across the small 
part of the back, several times a day. It has never, it is said, 
failed. 

SULPHUR. Mixed with salt, and given to cattle, sheep, horses 
and hogs, will keep ticks from them. Also put sulphur in the food 
of fowls, and they will not be troubled with lice. 

HOG CHOLERA AND BURNT CORN. It is said by a farmer that burnt 
corn will cure hog cholera. 

SORE THROAT IN SWINE. This is a swelling of the glands of the 
throat attended by wheezing, and general weakness of the animal. 
Indigo is useful for it, a piece as large as a hickory nut mashed up 
in water and poured down. Once is generally sufficient. 

To KEEP SWINE HEALTHY. Mix with their food daily, wood 
charcoal. 

FKUITS. 

THE APPLE. No fruit is more universally used and popular, than 
the apple. When peeled, cored and well cooked, it is a most grate- 
ful food for the dyspeptic. The best of cider is made from it, and 
many sorts are used for the table in a cooked or raw state. It forms 
the most important article of food in the shape of pies, puddings, 
wholesome and delicious jellies, sauces, marmalades and sweetmeats, 
and can be used with flour or corn meal for making bread. It can 
be dried or put away in its natural state for winter use, for pies, 
dumplings, and many other things, and is considered, when roasted, 
very strengthening to a weak stomach, It grows in all temperate 
climates, It is often mentioned in the Bible ; and by Homer, as a 
valuable fruit in his time. 

THE VARIOUS USES OF THE LEMON AND ITS FRUIT. It is a native 
of Asia, and there it grows to the heighth of 60 feet. Not only the 
fruit, but the whole tree is valuable as medicine. Whether in health 
or not, lemonade is the safest and best drink for any person. The 
shortest way to make it, is to squeeze the juice in cold water, or to 
slice and soak it in cold water, or boil the slices, either way is good. 
It is suitable to all stomach diseases, is excellent in cases of jaun- 
dice, liver complaints, inflamation of the bowels, stomach diseases

and fevers, against worms and skin diseases, it is a specific. The 
juice of the lemon is the best scorbutic remedy known. It not only 
cures, but prevents this disease. If the gums are rubbed with it 
daily, it will keep them in health, and the daily use of it will keep the 
nails and hands white, soft and supple, and is far preferable to soap. 
It will prevent chill blains. If mixed with strong, hot, black coffee 
with sugar, it is healthful, and is excellent in intermittent fevers ; it 
will cure neuralgia by rubbing the part affected with a cut lemon ; 
will destroy dandruff on the head by rubbing the roots of the hair with 
it; will cure warts. It is a natural remedy, a panacea, and nature 
is our best physician ; and all her remedies are the best, if we would 
only use them. 

LEMON JUICE, TO PRESERVE. Strain the expressed juice through 
a bag into a glass vessel, then put a small quantity af almond or 
olive oil into a glass bottle and pour the juice in ; the oil rises to the 
top and prevents the air from penetrating and spoiling it. The 
juice is good for rheumatism, scurvy and fevers, and its frequent use 
will prevent disease. The most healthful of all fruits, except the 
apple. 

To KEEP LEMONS FOR LEMONADE. Slice them through when per- 
fectly fresh and pack the slices in glass jars with a thick layer of fine 
white sugar between, and they will keep good for i year. 

To KEEP WATER MELONS AND OTHER Fuurrs TILL CHRISTMAS. 
Paint the melons etc. with a mucilage that will not rub off, common 
paste of flour and a little alum will do ; set it away to dry, then paint 
over 3 times, allowing them to dry each time. Then keep them in 
a cool, dry place, so as not to freeze. 

To SAVE FRUIT WITHOUT SUGAR. Put in wide mouthed bottles, 
and fill up with clear cold water (spring water the better), put them 
into a vessel of water up to the neck; boil 1-2 hour, tie bladders or 
oil skin over tight, or cork and seal while hot ; or put them in self- 
sealing cans or jars ; let them remain till cold. Keep in a cool place. 
Use as soon as opened. In order to steady them, pack hay around 
them while boiling. 

PEARS, A DELICIOUS WAY TO COOK. Take 8 medium sized or 6 
large pears, 8 oz. of sugar, i gill of sweet wine, 8 cloves (whole) ; 
some grated nutmeg to taste, 1-2 of a large lemon, 1-2 oz. gelatine. 
Peel the pears nicely, then quarter them, lay them in a shallow dish 
or pan with the cloves, cinnamon or nutmeg, sugar and just enough 
water to cover them ; set in the oven and stew slowly till tender, but 
not broken. Take up the pears, leaving the liquor, and put them 
on a dish for the table. To every cupful of the liguor allow the 1-2 
ounce of gelatine, the juice and grated rind of the 1-2 lemon, and 
wine. Let these ingredients boil quickly for 5 minutes, strain the

rather warm liquid over the pears and set them in a cool place ; 
when cold, serve on a glass dish. 

NOTE. If a pink color is desired for the jelly, add a few drops of 
cochineal. 

BAKED PEARS. Mrs. Stubbs. Place in a stone bowl or dish first 
a layer of pears (without paring), then a layer of sugar, then pears, 
and so on till the jar is full ; then put in as much water as it will 
hold. Bake in oven 3 hours. Very nice. 

To KEEP PEACHES FOR WINTER USE. Take the soundest and 
gently wipe off the fur, then varnish it over with gum arabic water ; 
when this is dry, varnish them over twice more ond set them away 
carefully, so as not to bruise them. When you wish to use them, 
the varnish will break off very easily, so you can have ripe peaches in 
mid winter. 

FRIED PLUMS. Put i Ib. of plums with 1-2 wine, 1-2 water, a 
piece of sugar, some cinnamon and lemon peel to the fire and boil 
till soft, then put them on a plate. Let them get cold ; take out the 
stone of each plum and put in its place a shelled almond. Now stir 
a ladleful of flour and an egg with some wine till smooth ; let i 1-2 
oz. of butter warm with 1-2 glass of wine; mix this with the said 
batter; it must, however, be a little thicker than pancake batter, so 
that too much does not stick to the plums. Turn the plums in this 
batter, fry them in lard till of a light brown ; strew them with sugar 
and cinnamon. 

N. B. Peaches, pears and cantaloupes are prepared in the same 
manner as the fried apple slices. 

To DRY CHFRRIES WITH SUGAR. Stone 6 pounds of sour cher- 
ries, put them in a preserving pan with 2 Ibs. of loaf sugar, pounded 
and strewed among them ; simmer them till they shrivel, then strain 
them from the juice, lay them on a hot surface or in an oven that is 
cool enough to dry without baking them. The same syrup will do 
another 6 Ibs. of fruit. 

PEACH LEATHER, Take soft peaches and remove the skins from 
them, mash to a pulp and force them through a colander. If the 
peaches are not very ripe, add a little sugar to them. Butter well 
panes of glass (large ones are best), spread the paste smoothly upon 
them, set in the sun to dry; when dry on one side, turn it. and when 
thoroughly dry, roll and keep in boxes with finely powdered sugar 
dusted over them. Butter strips of cloth and spread upon well sea- 
soned boards when glass is not convenient. 



FIG CULTIVATION. 475 



DRIED FRUITS. 

THE CITRON TO PRESERVE OR DRY. The citron should be cut in 
strips and laid on a clean board, or on dishes and dried in the sun 
as other fruits. 

To DRY CITRON OR WATER MELON RIND. Place in the sun to dry 
after preserving them. Either is an excellent substitute for the im- 
ported citron, in making puddings and cakes. 

To DRY FIGS. Make a moderate strong ley of soda and water, 
then dip the ripe figs in it, and wipe them dry. Make a syrup of 
one-half pound of sugar to one of the figs; when of sufficient thick- 
ness, drop the fruit in and let them scald well. Take them up, and 
place them on a flat dish and stem upwards, place the bottom of 
another dish or plate, and press them gradually to Hat shapes. Sprinkle 
them \vith fine sugar, and set in the hot sun with a frame cover, made 
of very coarse musquito net, stretched over a frame of slats to pre- 
vent the insects from getting to them, or a frame work of wire gauze. 
Turn them with a knife when dry, pack them in boxes or jars, with 
sugar between the layer of figs. If the weather is damp, dry in an 
oven or stove. 

DRYING FIGS. Pick the figs when thoroughly ripe, dry them on 
sacks as you would other fruit, in the sun, four or five days, or until 
the water they contain is thoroughly evaporated. If there is any 
dew, cover them over at nights. Then place them in a vessel per- 
forated with holes, like a colander, and dip them into boiling water 
for one minute, after which expose them to the sun until the surface 
water is evaporated, then lay them in wood, tin, earthern or other 
vessels, and keep closely so as to exclude the air, and cover securely. 
In this way it is reported figs have been preserved equally to the 
best imported. The scalding answers the double purpose of killing 
all insects' eggs and softening the skin of the fruit so that the sugar 
will come to the surface, as may be seen in imported figs. 

HOW FIGS ARE CULTIVATED IN FLORIDA. 

This mode of cultivation will apply in every way to the southern 
portion of the United States as well as Mexico, where it will grow in 
almost any kind of soil, and very luxuriantly in a rich heavy soil. 
But to produce the most valuable fruit for commerce, the tree should 
grow in a soil of good depth, rich, light and sandy. This will pro- 
duce a white thin skin of the best quality. Repairing the soil.

able depth, till well pulverized, and freed from vegetation , and ex

trasieuiis roots. The figs are propogated from slips, selected with as 
many joint buds as possible. To form a tree two slips are placed 
one foot apart, and then joined at the top. The trees if planted in 
rich soil, should be placed about thirty feet apart, and for poor soil 25 
feet distant from each other. The cuttings are planted in the month 
of March, two in a hole about nine or twelve inches apart at the 
root end, then gradually bring the top buds to meet just crossing 
them like an X; then tread in the earth well. The cuttings must be 
full of buds or eyes, and when about to plant them cut the root end 
off at the first knot, care being taken not leave any of the pulp in 
sight, as it will then be liable to be attacked with worms, which will 
make the tree hollow and sickly. The cuttings are put into the 
ground within an inch or two of the top, after which the process of 
crossing must take place. The ground must be trodden within one or 
two inches of the top, then cover the remainder over with loose earth, 
which will protect the ends from the heat of the sun. When the 
trees arrive to the height of a man, cut off the tops to one uniform 
height and this will cause the tree to branch out. During the youth of 
the tree, the ground should be plowed up two or three times during the 
winter or spring, and the space between them may be used to cul- 
tivate any thing you wish. The system of plowing should be kept 
up, otherwise the fruit will depreciate in size and quality. 

To DRY THE OLIVE. Chinese. The Chinese sprinkle them with 
salt, dry them, and pack them away as herrings are packed. Thus 
prepared they are not objectionable, and in flavor they resemble the 
herring. 

ORANGES EATEN BEFORE BREARFAST. A distinguished physician 
has said that if his patients would make a practice of eating a good 
orange before breakfast from February to June his practice would 
be gone. 

How TO PRESERVE ORANGES AND LEMONS AFTER THEY BECOME 
SPECKED. Buy a number of dry and damaged fruit, cut out the 
specks, peel them in as large pieces as you can, boil them,chop the boil- 
ed peels fine, weigh them and the pulp, which may be chopped with 
them, and allow i pound of sugar to i pound of fruit. As the fruit 
is the most valuable, you need not grudge the sugar. Make a 
syrup of the sugar, for which you may use a little of the last boil- 
ing water from the peel ; put in the fruit and boil i hour till it is 
thick and stirs heavily. Lemons are less juicy than oranges, and 
require a rather thinner syrup. Use these marmalades either to eat 
with bread or to make pies or puddings. 

EDIBLE PASSION FLOWER FRUIT. The small grows in temperate 
climates as well as in torrid climates. The seeds are enclosed in a 
pulpy mass, which is of delicious flavor. The large fruit grows in 



FIG CULTIVATION. 477 

torrid zones, and are of enormous size. The pulp is excellent, and 
much enjoyed. 

STRAWBERRY CULTURE. Pennsylvania. How to grow strawber- 
ries properly for home use is a question that has never yet been en- 
tirely settled to the satisfaction of every one. We believe, however, 
that most persons prefer growing them in beds, with runners kept 
off by constant cutting, and then mulch the surface of the soil to 
preserve a fair amount of moisture. In forming beds there also ex- 
ists a great diversity of opinion in relation to the distance apart to 
set plants. I believe in plenty of room when extra fine fruit as well 
as plenty of it is required. I am aware that some English garden- 
ers, for the purpose of securing exhibition fruit, set their plants two 
feet apart in the rows, and the rows 3 feet apart. Others again ad- 
vocate planting them i foot apart, with 2 feet between the rows; 
and after one crop of fruit has been gathered, remove each alter- 
nate plant in the row, thus leaving a space of 2 feet each way be- 
tween the plants. Of course no careful, neat gardener would think 
of allowing his runners to encumber the ground for the purpose of 
securing a large amount of little, imperfect berries. Such a course 
is always attended with positive loss, and is indicative of sloven- 
liness. When grown as I have suggested, say 2 feet apart each 
way, or at most 2 feet by 18 inches, and then carefully cultivated 
and enriched every year bountifully, I believe that most kinds 
will live and be profitable for 6 or 8 years. I know the Tri- 
umphe de Grand in heavy soils will, and the quantity of fruit will 
annually increase as the plants gets older. An excellent way to 
apply the manure is to spread it over the surface liberally in the 
autumn and in the spring fork it under, covering at once with the 
mulching material. 

PRUNING BLACKBERRIES. Germantown Telegraph. Persons hav- 
ing cultivated the new Rochelle blackberry are possessed of suffi- 
cient knowledge to understand the fact that the longer they allow 
the caries to remain unpruned the lateral branches are proportionally 
slender and the fruit smaller. To obtain the largest sized berries 
and the largest quantity, too, cut back the leading canes to not ex- 
ceeding 4 feet in length and shorten also the lateral branches. This 
will be found to increase also tl\e length and breadth of the stool, 
affording more bearing room, and generally to result in greatly im- 
proving the crop. It is not too late yet to shorten in where it has 
been much neglected, as we often see in some of our gardens. In 
July the young wood, which by that time has grown over the tops of 
the old, bending canes, should be clipped, especially the lateral 
branches. It will have the best effect upon the next year's 
crop. 



478 TREES AND SHRUBS. 



TREES AND SHRUBS. 

FRENCH METHOD OF GRAFTING. Long a secret. A limb of wil- 
low, 3 or 4 inches thick, was buried in a trench deep enough to re- 
ceive it, and at the distance of every 4 or or 5 inches holes were 
bored, into which grafts were inserted, care being taken to make the 
bark of the graft and the limb into which it was inserted touch ; the 
lower part of the graft was pointed and the bark shaved off. The 
limb and the grafts were then covered with earth, and about two 
inches of the latter above the surface. In process of time the wil- 
low limb rotted, and the grafts took root. The different grafts were 
then dug up and transplanted. 

WHEN TO GRAFT. Cut last year's shoots in February ; graft 
from the time the sap runs until the bark sticks in spring. 

GRAFTING WAX. Liquid. For covering wounds in trees, kept 
in wide-mouthed bottles, closely corked. It is laid on in as 
thin a coat as possible with a flat wood paddle. Within a few days 
it is as hard as stone. There is no better preparation for this pur- 
pose. It is made as follows : Melt i pound of 'resin over a gentle 
lire, add to it i ounce of beef tallow and stir it well ; take it from 
the fire, let it cool a liftle, and then mix with it a tabiespoonful of 
spirits of turpentine and i ounce of 25 per cent, alcohol. Thealco- 
nol cools it down so rapidly that it will be necessary to put it on the 
fire again. Stir constantly; be careful not to let the alcobol take 
fire. To prevent this, take it from the fire, and when the lumps be- 
gin to form put it back again, and this must be continued until the 
mass is similar to liquid honey. 

To CURE GUMMY TREES. Apply a paste over the parts made of 
horse droppings, clay and tar. The places should be washed per- 
fectly clean before the application. 

ACACIA is supposed to be the burning bush, and the consecrated 
timber of the tabernacle. 

THE AILANTHUS AND CASTOR OIL SILK WORMS. The silk pro- 
duced by the worm fed on the leaf of the alanthus, is considered 
more valuable than that fed on the castor bean leaf. It takes dye 
easier, is more durable, it is mere brilliant, smooth and supple. It 
lasts double as long, it does not easily spot, and washes like linen. 
The ailanthus is so easily grown that it becomes almost a nuisance, 
in temperate latitudes, and when dry the wood burns like punk. 
The silk is coarser than that produced by the mulberry leaf. It 
grows in China and Japan. It puts up a considerable number of 
shoots, and the seeds are blown about by the wind. 

IN PLANTING OUT APPLE TREES. Have an eye to dry rising 
ground, sheltered from the northern and southern winds. 



TREES AND SHRUBS. 479 

NUTRICIOUS PROPERTIES OF APPLES. It has been found from 
careful analysis, that the apple contains a larger amount of phos- 
pcrous or brain food than any other fruit or vegetable and on this 
account they are very important to sedentary men, the action of 
whose livers are too sluggish, to eliminate effete matter, which if re- 
tained in the system, produce inaction of the brain, and indeed of the 
whole system, causing jaundice, sleepiness, drowsiness and trouble 
some diseases of the skin. 

THE CUSTARD APPLE. Is like a thin rough bag, acocoanut full 
of custard, and such a custard no cook ever yet achieved. Is eaten 
with a spoon. 

THK BANANA. Grows easily from the suckors, and according 
to Humbolt, is 33 times as prolific as wheat and 44 times as 
prolific as the potato. 

BANANA TREES. Every family should have them for their own use 
in the land of fruits. They will grow from suckers easily. 

PLANTAINS. Can be cooked like apples, or sliced and fried in 
fat or oil. 

IN JAVA. I saw them fried in cocoanut oil. The plantain is 
twice larger than the banana; with the pine apples, they both nestle 
in the green borders of large or small forms. 

THE BANANA is a thoroughly tropical plant. When planted on 
plantations, the stumps are planted from 6 to 10 feet apart each 
way. In tropical and semi-tropical countries they grow with 
scarcely any care if the roots can have access to water. They 
bear in ten months from planting, one bunch of fruit to each tree. 
Planted in holes 18 inches deep, 10 feet apart, which is partly filled 
with rubbish and then with earth in which the stubble is set, and 
the soil pressded firmly in. 

BEEF SUET TREE. Grows on the Mississippi river, with scarlet 
acid berries about the size of red currants, but much richer in taste, 
and much cherished; grows in continued clusters, and should be 
grown in California. 

THE HORSE CHESTNUT. The French make a starch of it. 

THE OLEANDER. The wood, the leaves, flowers and bark are 
poisonous, Children have been seriously, if not fatally poisoned 
from sucking the flowers. An infusion of the leaves will kill insects 
and the bark rats. Farmers in Bermuda are under the impression 
that the plant poisons the grass, and animals are killed by eating it. 
Perhaps the dead leaves fall on and among the grass and are eaten 
with it. In Bermuda they use the oleander to form hedges. 

How TO PLANT AN ORANGE GROVE. Treatise on orange culture,

out your 3 or 4 year-old sweet seedling orange trees, procured from 
any nurseryman, 20 or 26 feet apart each way. Plant 50 or not 
more than 100 sions, as you cannot for several years do justice to 
any more. You can add to these by seedlings of your own grow- 
ing, as you should save and plant every seed from good oranges 
that comes into your possession. When buying your seedlings see 
that they are thrifty, free from insects, and are the owners of good, 
fibrous roots. Do all your pruning at the time of transplanting, cut- 
ting away sufficient top to create a balance between the top and 
roots. October and November may be considered the best months 
for the removal of the trees, as it is the commencement of a resting 
period for all of the tree that is above the ground. If the spring 
planting is preferred, February and March are safe months, and the 
trees will do very well. Plant no other trees between your orange 
trees. Set your trees at least 1-2 an inch higher than they were in 
the nursery. More damage is done by setting trees too low than 
by all or any other causes combined. 

MANURE FOR ORANGE TREES. After having made the hole for 
the trees to be planted in, take some wood soil, such as consists 
of rotten and decayed wood or leaves or well rotten composts, 
consisting of dirt, lime, leaves and road or lot scrappings (no 
fresh animal manure), and deposit about a bucketful or two in 
each hole, and plant the tree on top ; or, which we consider a 
better plan, set the tree in the hole, and cover the roots with the 
above manure, shaking the tree while throwing it in, and finish 
with the original soil on the top. There should be no manure on 
the surface, where soil is naturally strong; it is sufficient to cover the 
roots with the top soil taken out of the hole on top, and on this 
spread from 2 to 3 quarts of lime (slacked). After planting we 
would advise you to mulch under all circumstances. Salt mash grass 
is the very best material, next fine straw, dead weeds, &c. Burnt 
oyster shells will answer the purpose where lime is desired. After 
having been applied for some time, and when weeds commence to 
appear, incorporate it lightly with the soil with a hoe, then mulch. 

THE TEAR is also a wild fruit, growing wild in Europe, and is culti- 
vated in all temperate climates. In China they weigh from 8 to 10 
pounds, but are comparatively insipid and of coarse grain. Useful 
in culinary purposes, well spiced and sweetened with sugar. I have 
tasted them there, but found them rough and too dry to eat without 
the aid of foreign ingredients after being exposed to a toasting heat 
for some time. Of this most delicious and almost matchless fruit, 
there are more than 200 varieties. More than 2,000 years ago it 
was known to the Greeks and Romans. 

AVACATA OR ALIGATOR PEAR. The latter being a corruption of

the true name, being called so by the negroes of the West India 
Islands. It is the only fruit that cats will eat. In Brazil it is eaten 
with wine and sugar. In the West Indies with pepper, mustard and 
vinegar as a vegetable. 

PERSIMMONS, THE KIND. Of this fruit we have any quantity 
and different kinds all over the Southern and Western States, but are 
not so large by a great deal as those in China, but are equally as de- 
licious, and can be had without money and without price, so great 
is the yield. They are left to dry on the trees, and in January and 
February are dry, granulated and sweet. I have seen the deep yel- 
low and green persimmon of China summer and autumn, both 
equally good ripened in lime artificially, some measuring 8 inches 
in circumference. Our own persimmons are valuable for making 
winter beer, which I have tasted equal to delicious wine. The bark 
of the tree is good in making black die for woolen goods, and that 
or the green fruit is a most useful and valuable astringent in making 
throat gargles and in diarrhea. 

THE COCOANUT TREE ITS VALUE. Furnishes the inhabitants of 
the tropics with bread, water, and wine vinegar, oil, honey and su- 
gar. From its leaves, shells and husks of the fruit they obtain 
threads, clothes, vases, cups, baskets, paper, boat sails and ropes. 
How could these people live without the cocoanut tree ? 

THE COCOA grows from 15 to 20 feet high, and may be easily 
seen from a distance by the yellowish green leaves. Should be 
planted 12 feet apart, and when first planted, should be protected 
from the sun by a plantain leaf. Three years after planting the trees 
yield, and thereafter require but little attention. The nuts or fruit 
grow directly from the the under branches. The pulp from which 
the seeds are taken is white, and makes a deliciously refreshing 
drink, called cocoa wine. 

To PLANT PEACHES. In October excavate a bed of earth 5 
inches deep, place in the stones and cover with earth 2 inches deep, 
and in winter, to prevent freezing, cover with pine boughs, stalks or 
straw. In the spring, as soon as the stones begin to open with the 
swelling kernel, open the bed and plant the kernels in rows, 4 1-2 
feet apart and distant 4 inches from each other. The stones that 
have not been opened, may be cracked with a hammer and planted 
in the same way. Plough and cultivate the seedlings until "budding 
time," which will be about the loth of August, or earlier, according 
to the latitude. Take buds from thrifty orchard trees, 3 or 4 years 
old, cut the buds i inch long, having an eye in the middle. The 
husk will easily cleave from the wood, and the bud without the wood 
is best. Slit the seedling close to the ground and insert the bud and 
secure it by wrapping round it strands of Russia mat, twine, or any 



482 TREES AND SHRUBS. 

convenient loose wrapping material. In a few days the bud will ad- 
here to the wood, and the wrapping can be removed. Early the fol- 
lowing spring cut off the seedling near the bud (about 1-2 inch 
above the bud), then for 6 weeks keep the stump clear from suckers. 
In the fall or following spring, plant the seedling, now become a 
Iree, to the same depth as they stand in the nursery, and from 15 to 
20 feet apart. In all cases, peach trees should be planted when of 
one season's growth. When heads are forming, carefully prune, so 
as to form a low head and cut off useless branches. Pruning^is best 
done in spring. Shortening one half of the growth of the zd and 3d 
years after pruning and keeping the inside of the trees clear of use- 
less growth, is all that is required in the way of pruning before the 
trees commence bearing. 

NOTE. The borers, which enter the body of the tree, or a little 
below the ground, must be removed with a knife from year to year. 
Peach trees grow on corn land and require about the same cultiva- 
tion. No manure is required until they have borne one crop. Wood 
ashes, bone dust or guano is good. 

TANSY AND PEACHES. I remember seeing a clump of peach trees 
of greater altitude, and more spreading than usual; the fruit was deli- 
cious, both free and cling stones. A large damask rose bush grew 
as tall as the trees, and the flowers hung in beautiful clusters from the 
top, which, in my young eyes, were more beautiful than their sisters 
which were tangible to me ; how I coveted those bright roses. This 
was in the rear portion of the garden at my great-grandmama's. I 
remember the surroundings. At the foot of those trees grew a per- 
fect carpet of ground ivy, and hard by, large beds of tansy, feather 
few, rue, camomile, lavender, and wormwood. Now why did those 
trees continue to flourish and bear good fruit so long ? They could 
not have been less than 50 years old, for all the immediate family 
was dead, while my blessed grandmother survived to smile on her 
4th generation through the vistas of ninety winters. 

THE PEACH is derived from the small, bitter fruit, which grows in 
its natural state in Russia. The parent fruit posesses no poisonous 
properties. 

THE QUINCE. Grows wild in Asia, but more particularly in the 
western part, among the Ural Mountains and in the neighboring 
parts of Europe and Asia. 

TABLE OF DISTANCES, at which trees, etc., should be planted: 
Standard apple trees 20 to 30 feet each way ; dwarf varieties of

ties 10 feet; peach, plum, apricot 12 to 20 feet; gooseberries, 
raspberries, blackberries 3 to 8 feet ; grape vines 5 to 8 feet. 



TREKS AND SHRUBS. 483 

BIDDING THE ROSE. This can be performed at any time when 
both stock and bud are in proper condition. The bark of the 
stock must peel freely from its woody foundation in order that the 
bud may be successfully inserted. It is not necessary that the bark 
of the bud should peel, but a thin slice of the wood can remain at- 
tached to the bud and be successfully introduced and propogated; 
but the best condition with an experienced operator, is when the 
bark is separated from the wood, all except a very small portion pro- 
jecting up into the rose bud; this allowed to remain, and the bark 
and bfld inserted in the usual way. Usually the budding of the rose 
is performed to the best advantage from April till July inclusive, 
but if the shrub is growing freely, the bark is usually in a condition 
to peel and then budding can be performed with very certain 
success. 

ROSE BUDS TO PRESERVE. A German way. To keep fresh 
during the winter, first cover the recently cut stem with wax, and 
then placing each one in closed paper cap or cover, so that the 
leaves do not touch the paper. The cap is then coated with glue, 
to exclude the air, dust, and moisture, and when dry.i t is stood up 
in a cool place. When wanted for use, the bud is 'taken out of the 
cup and placed in water, after cutting the ends, when the rose will 
bloom in a few hours. 

THE ROSE. The rose is emblematical of everything beautiful, 
pure and delightful poetic image of purity and innocence. 
Among the ancients, the emblem of joy, and love, and prudence. It 
requires two hundred roses to make i oz. of the attar. 

LEAVES OF THE TEA ROSE are valuable in flavoring tea. 

TEA is raised in Brazil from the seed, which is preserved in brown 
sugar. Can be transported to any part of the country. It is 
planted in beds, then like the cabbage plants, transplanted to the 
fields. Set about five feet apart. Kept clean by the hoe and 
plough. Pruned to about four feet high. Bears in three years. 

TREES, THEIR USE IN PROTECTING ANIMALS FROM THE HEAT. 
Shade trees should be in every pasture, near every barn and by 
every watering place, under which animals may screen themselves 
from the heat of a summer's sun. The milk will be better as well 
as the flesh and fleece of the animals. 

FRUIT TREES. Boil one tablespoonful of borax in a pint of water. 
Paint the stems of the fruit trees with the liquid. This will destroy 
the green fungi, and prevent insect life from forming in the bark, 
and make the tree healthy. 

WOOD ASHES. For fruit trees. Sprinkle some on the tops and 
limbs when moist with dew, then cover the ground with ashes at the 
roots. It forms an excellent manure. 



484 THE VINEYARD. 

To PREPARE NAILS FOR WALL TREES.--These should be of cast 
iron if they can be obtained. Before using, they should be heated 
redhot, and then thrown into cold linseed oil. This gives them a 
varnish which preserves them from rusting and prevents the mortar 
of the wall, from sticking to them when they are drawn. 

COMPOSITION FOR WOUNDS ON ROSE BUSHES. 5 parts pitch, i part 
each resin, beef tallow, beeswax. These should be mixed in a small 
boiler, and dissolved over a slow fire; apply it to the wounds with 
a brush, and it will heal them as well as prevent them from dying. 

THE VINEYARD. 

AVERAGE production of the grape per acre, 8,000 pounds. 

TENDRIL OF THE GRAPE. Its taste, while green, is a true index 
to what kind of fruit. The taste of the seedling may be used in the 
same way. 

To PROTECT GRAPES FROM WASPS. Plant near the grapes some 
yew trees, and the wasps will prefer the yew tree berries and will 
wholly neglect the grapes. 

BLEEDING IN VINES. Work together i part calcined oyster shells 
beaten to a fine powder in a mortar and 3 parts cheese until they 
form a sort of paste. This mixture is to be spread into the pores 
of the wood, when bleeding takes place, by means of the thumb 
and finger. A second application is sometimes necessary. 

MILDEW ON GRAPES. As soon as the leaves are fairly out of the 
buds apply flowers of sulphur, and again when the stems are formed 
and the blossoms are fully open. No mildew will occur as the sulphur 
enters among the circulation of the plant. 

KEEPING GRAPES. In cutting the grapes leave the bunches at- 
tached to the branches that bore them ; sharpen the points of the 
branches where they have been detached from the parent stem and 
run them a couple of inches into mangel wortzel beets; then 
lay them on a shelf of the fruit room and allow the grapes to hang 
over the shelf, where they can be cut as required. They will keep 
plump all the winter. 

THE GRAPE is an important branch of rural economy, and should 
have a sunny exposure. There are more than 1,500 varieties of 
the grape. It should never be planted in a moist soil. 

THE history of the grape is as old as that of man. All varie- 
ties of the wine grape came originally from Persia. The Mus- 
cat and Hamburgh, the most popular when dried, forms the rai- 
sin of commerce, and produce the finest of wines. 

KEEPING GRAPES. They should remain on the vine until the end 
of November, taking care to supply them with plenty of air and a 



VINEGARS. 485 

little fire for an hour or two every day when the weather is damp, 
but no heat should remain in the flues at night. After that month 
they should be cut. Carefully wrap the bunches in paper and sus- 
pend them in a dry room moderately warmed. They will remain 
fresh till the spring. 

GRAPES TO KEEP. Chinese method. Cut a circular piece out of 
a pumpkin or gourd just large enough to admit the hand, remove 
the inside, put the grapes in, and press the piece back firmly. 
Keep the pumpkin in a cool place. 

GRAPES FOR WINTER USE. Take ripe grapes, pick off from the 
stems, wash them perfectly clean, place in jars and cover with mo- 
lasses. After two or three days seal over and tie up tightly. 
For mince pies and seasoning in winter they are delicious. 

To PRESERVE GRAPES WITH PAPEK. First pick off all unsound 
or unripe grapes and lay the clusters in an empty room on papers 
till dry, for in all packages some will be crushed and dampen oth- 
ers ; then any empty crate will do to pack them in. First a layer of 
grapes, then a thickness of paper, so as to exclude the air and keep 
them separate, then grapes, then paper, and so on till you have 3 
or 4 layers -no more than 4. If the box is to hold more, put in a 
partition to support the others that are to be packed. 

VINEGAKS. 

HORSERADISH VINEGAR. Into a bottle put 1-4 Ib of powdered 
horseradish, i ounce of bruised shalot, i spoonful of cayenne, i 
quart of vinegar, which shake every day for a fortnight. After steep- 
ing thoroughly, strain and bottle, and it will be fit for immediate 
use. It is an agreeable relish to cold meats of any kind. In Octo- 
ber or November the root is then in its highest perfection, and the 
vinegar should be then made, and should be closely corked after and 
when not in use. 

CIDER VINEGAR. Take it from the press and pour it in a cask, 
and let it remain in a warm place with the bung out, and in 6 or 8 
months the vinegar will be excellent. Should the cask leak, stop 
the crack with tallow or dry rye flour. 

CIDER VINEGAR No. 2. To each gallon of cider put a pound of 
white sugar, and let them steep together well and ferment for four 
months, and a strong and well colored vinegar will be the result. 

ESCHOLET, OR GARLIC VINEGAR. Clean, peel and powder 4 ozs. 
ofshalots, or half the quantity of garlic, in the season when they are 
young and tender and not acrid, steep them in a quart of the best 
vinegar and bottle for use. 

STRAWBERRY VINEGAR, Take the strawberries that are fresh and 



486 VINEGARS. 

ripe, tie a thick paper over over the mouth of the vessel in which 
they are placed and mash them and let them remain 3 or 4 days, 
then place them in a jelly, or linen, or flannel bag, and suspend them 
over a vessel, so that it can drain freely without pressure. Measure 
it after straining, and for every quart of juice put 1-2 Ib. of refined 
sugar coarsly powdered; when nearly dissolved, stir the syrup over 
a clear fire, and after it has boiled 4 or 5 minutes, skim it thorough- 
ly Pour it into a clean stone or china jug or pitcher; cork slightly 
for several days or it may burst, then cork tightly in 4 or 5 days 
place in a cool dry place. A spoonful or two in a glass of water 
makes a delightful summer drink and is valuable in cases of sick- 
ness, and is much relished by invalids. 

BLACKBERRY VINEGAR, can be prepared in the same way that 
strawberrry vinegar is prepared, and makes a most delightful sum- 
mer drink by mixing it with water ; seasoning sauces, etc. 

RASPBERRY JUICE. Crush well some ripe raspberries and keep 
them overnight in a jar in a cellar; next day squeeze the juice 
through a cloth ; allow i Ib. of sugar to i Ib. of juice. Put the liquid 
to the fire, and after skimming it well, boil it till clear. This will be 
done in 1-2 hour. When cool, bottle and ccrk it well. Tie up and 
keep in a cool dry place. 

CHERRY VINEGAR. Take black cherries, pick off the stalks, crush 
them in a mortar and treat them like raspberry juice. 

RASPBERRY VINEGAR. Mrs. E's. Recipe. Put 3 pounds of the 
fruit and i pound of sugar in a porcelain kettle and mash them well 
together; cook the juice for 20 minutes, then stir in 1-2 pint of cider 
vinegar to every pound. Give it one boil up and strain it. When 
cold, bottle and cork it. This keeps well, but does not have the ex- 
quisite flavor of the fresh fruit the other has. I have tested both 
for years. Strawberry, blackberry and raspberry vinegars are made 
alike. 

CRAB APPLE VINEGAR. Lay ripe crab apples in a heap to sweat, 
then throw away the stalks and decayed fruit ; mash the apples and 
express the juice. A cider or wine press would be useful for this 
purpose. Strain it, and in one month it will be ready for use, and is 
the best simple substitute for lemon juice that can be found. 

VINEGAR FROM THE LEES OF SPIRIT OR WINE CASKS. From what- 
ever substance vinegar is produced, it advances more rapidly if put 
in a cask. Put the lees into a cask or stone jar reserved for the pur- 
pose, when you have a sufficient quantity, boil the whole briskly for 
1-2 hour, skimming it well, and then return it to a clean dry cask, 
and to every gallon of vinegar put a pint of best white wine vinegar 
and a few leaves of curled mustard. Stop the cask, and in i month 
the vinegar will be good. 



VINEGARS. 487 

VEGETABLE VINEGAR. Have ready a jar, keg or barrel and when 
ever you have scraps of fruit, raw, dried or cooked, or vegetables, 
throw them into this vessel, put boards or weights over it when it 
ferments and strain off the liquor into bottles ; put in the sun. Syr- 
ups, preserves, sugar, etc., left from meals, can be used; paiings and 
cores of fruit also. The vinegar is pure and good. 

N. B. Vegetable vinegars are wholesome and nearest in nature 
to the qualities of the stomach juices, which perform the offices of 
digestion, and hence, ordinarily, they must promote and aid diges- 
tion. 

Tickles, when made with vegetable vinegar, are wholesome. 
OUR SISTER'S RASPBERRY VINEGAR. Mix i quart of fresh rasp- 
berries with i quart of vinegar, put in the fruit for 3 mornings ; strain 
it before adding the fresh ones. The fourth day press the juice in, 
straining it, put 1-2 Ib. of sugar to every pint of juice and stir it well 
till dissolved. Put it into pint bottles and cork tight. This is a fine 
beverage with cool ice water in summer, and very grateful to the 
sick 

CELERY VINEGAR. Pound 1-2 pint of celery seeds and mix them 
in a quart of cider vinegar with a few mustard seeds and a teaspoon- 
ful of sugar. Shake it often and strain it off in 20 days for use. 
This is healthy and decidedly agreeable. 

TOMATO VINEGAR. Take as many tomatoes as you may design 
to use and quarter them, leaving the bottoms undivided ; rub enough 
salt over them to taste, then put them in a wide-mouthed jar in a 
cool oven or stove, or by the side of a warm fire-place for 48 hours, 
then add i or 2 bruised cloves of garlic. Some cloves, mace and 
nutmeg, all beaten ; 1-2 pint of white mustard seeds pounded in a 
mortar and pour over all the amount of vinegar desired ; let it be 
boiling. Tie a bladder over the mouth of the jar and let it remain 
6 or 7 days by the fire. Should be shaken well every day. Strain 
the liquor without pressing it, let it stand until quite clear, then bot- 
tle it tightly, and use the sediment for the present. The juice is a 
sub-acid, and is a great improvement to dishes. 

WATERMELON VINEGAR. Take all the internal portion of the 
melon and scrape the rind to obtain all the juice ; then carefully 
strain and pour into jugs with small glass bottles in their mouths ; 
set the jugs in the sun, and in time you will have a fine-flavored, 
clear, strong white vinegar. The vinegar at a certain stage will be 
very bitter, but when perfected, loses this, and acquires a true vine- 
gar taste. 

To STRENGTHEN VINEGAR. Expose a vessel of vinegar to the cold 
of a very frosty night ; next morning ice will be found in it, which, 
if thawed, will become pure water. The vinegar being freed from 



488 VINEGARS. 

so much water, will consequently be more acid than before, and the 
vinegar may thus be frozen again and again, until it becomes of the 
desired strength. 

DR. NIE'S VINEGAR. Add to each gallon of syrup composed of 
i 1-2 pounds of sugar to i gallon of water, i gill of yeast. Keep 
in a warm place 3 or 4 days, then draw in refining casks ; allow to 
each gallon i ounce of cream of tartar. When the sweet taste dis- 
appears draw off and bottle tightly. 

LEMON VINEGAR. Allow 5 quarts of vinegar to 3 dozen large 
lemons, 5 ounces of garlic, a teacupful of horseradish, i spoonful 
heaped of mace, i dessert spoonful of cloves, 1-2 tablespoonful ot 
pounded red pepper, i large coffee-cupful of white mustard beaten 
in a mortar, or the whole seeds ; then with a piece of glass or grater 
rasp off the rinds of the lemons, then nearly cut the lemons in two 
with a sharp knife, then press the salt into them with your fingers, 
then lay them on a pewter dish and cake the salt over them, then 
set them in a luke-warm oven, taking them out several times until 
the moisture is dried up into the peels and the fruit hard, but not 
scorched ; then add the garlic peeled and the horseradish cut small 
and thin, and let them remain in the above till all the juice is dried 
up. As soon as the salt is melted add more, and press it in ; then 
into a porcelain or copper kettle pour the vinegar with the pounded 
spices and the nutmegs, a large spoonful heaped, cut in small 
pieces, add the beaten mustard and pepper in muslin bags. When 
these have boiled together in the vinegar sufficiently, pour vinegar 
and all the ingredients boiling hot over the lemons, cover the vessel 
perfectly close, shake it well every day, and let it remain by the stove 
or fire for a full week; then keeping as close as possible, let it stand 
for several months to take off the bitter, then bottle it ; but before 
doing so, it must be strained through muslin or paper pulp two or 
three times. When freed from sediment entirely, add 31-2 pints of 
vinegar boiling hot to the remaining ingredients. When it becomes 
a month or two old it is nice for hash, fricasses, &c. It is nice 
to eat with fish, fowl, game or any fresh meat. 

HONEY VINEGAR. Put i quart of clear honey in 2 gallons of 
soft or filtered water; let it stand for 20 days in a warm place, 
and the vinegar will be good. 

CAYENNE VINEGAR. Put 1-2 pint of spirits or i pint of cider 
vinegar into a bottle with 1-2 ounce of cayenne pepper, and let 
it steep for a month ; then strain off and bottle for use. Used 
sparingly, it is excellent seasoning for soups, sauces and cold 
meats. 

CHILI VINEGAR Pound or halve 50 red California Chilies and 
infuse them in a pint of strong cider vinegar for a fortnight. 



VINEGARS. 



They will then be ready for use. It is an agreeable relish to fish, 
with a little melted butter, as many cannot eat them without vinegar 
and cayenne pepper. 

GOOSEBERRY VINEGAR. Mash a peck of fully ripe gooseberries 
in a vessel with a mallet, then put in 6 gallons of milk-warm water, 
and let it stand for a night and day ; then strain through a sieve 
and put in 22 pounds of sugar and mix it well; put it in a g-gallon 
cask, which, if not full, add more water. Let the mixture be stirred 
from the bottom 2 or 3 times a day. 

To PRESERVE SPICED VINEGAR FOR PICKLES. Take 3 or 4 small 
bowls of long pepper, 4 ounces ot black pepper, 3 ounces of white 
pepper, 4 ounces of allspice, 4 ounces of ginger, 4 ounces of cloves, 
4 ounces of mace, 4 ounces of garlic, 4 ounces of mustard, 6 ozs. 
of horseradish (either cut in pieces or rasped), 4 ounces of shalots, 
and 3 ounces of capsicums; put them into a stone jar (either 
new or one used for pickling) with a quart of the strongest cider or 
perry vinegar; stop the jar closely with a bung, cover that with a 
bladder soaked with the liquor, set it on a trivit by the side of a fire 
3 or 4 days, shaking it well 3 or 4 times a day. By pounding the 
spices half the quantity is enough, unless the quantity of the fruit be 
doubled ; the jar being well closed and the infusion being made with 
a mild heat or set in the hot sun for 4 or 5 days ; and here is no loss 
by evaporation. If several kinds of pickle are to be prepared, to 
all of which the above spices are suitable, a larger quantity may be 
prepared at once and used as occasion requires. 

SPICE VINEGAR. To 15 gals, of wine put 4 heaping tablespoon- 
fuls of cinnamon, 8 tablespoonfuls of black peppercorns, 4 nutmegs, 
crushed to powder ; when all these are ready, put them into a bag 
and boil them 2 or 3 times in 12 pints of cider vinegar, then boil the 
same quantity of choice wine, then half fill a barrel, which may grad- 
ually be filled up with a little wine, a little sour if convenient ; stop 
it and let the wine make. 

ON SOUTHERN PLANTATIONS, to promote the health of the slaves, 
each used for his dinner a portion of pure cider vinegar, and not that 
which was patented. Undertakers on railroads find that the use of 
pure apple vinegar with water, as a beverage, daily, and with their 
food, promotes health by keeping off summer diseases and malarious 
influences. 

AN EXCELLENT HOME VINEGAR can be made by simply putting 
the peelings and cores of fruit in a vessel, standing in a warm place, 
when ever you have them, or cutting up small ripe apples which are 
too small to be used otherwise, and add them. The vinegar will be 
good without costing a cent. A small portion of water should be 
added to increase fermentation. 



490 PICKLES. 

COLD WATER VINEGAR. To 6 gallons of rain or soft water add i 
gallon of molasses, 1-2 gallon hop yeast; set the cask in a warm 
place and stir it thoroughly once a week for several weeks, when you 
will have an excellent vinegar. Paste or nail a piece of thin cloth 
over the bung hole to keep out the insects and dust. 

VINEGAR. Hippocrates employed vinegar medicinally, and Moses 
mentions it nearly 1500 years before the birth of Christ. The Israel- 
ites, Greeks, Romans and Carthegenians used it extensively. 

PERRY VINEGAR. Put a number of pears, say 30 or 40 Ibs. in a 
tub, pour water over them and leave them for 3 days to ferment. 
Repeat this every day for a month, when you will have good vinegar, 
pour off into a cask. Apples may be done so also. 

PERRY OR PEAR VINEGAR is prepared from the pear in the same 
way that vinegar is prepared from apple cider, but it is far richer and 
much better for keeping green pickles and mangoes, giving them a 
mellow and crisp taste ; and mixing apple cider with an equal por- 
tion of perry, makes a cordial, equal to the most delicious wine. 

GENERAL REMARKS ON PICKLES. 

Large stone jars are the proper vessels for large pickles. Glass 
bottles with wide mouths do for small pickles, such as cherries, 
currants, nasturtiums, button onions, &c. Salt and vinegar which 
enter so largely into the composition of all pickles, act on the lead 
that is used in turning copper pans and dissolve the lead used in 
glazing earthern jars, and ought to be avoided. A bell metal 
skillet or kettle is good for holding vinegar, but a stone jar on a hot 
hearth, is best. As jars of pickles are frequently opened, and as the 
air is always injurious to vinegar, which is apt to lose its strength by 
exposure, and become torpid, so small jars of a quart or half gallon 
are preferable to large ones. Some housekeepers, put each kind 
of pickle in one large jar, and fill up the smaller ones from it as 
needed for present use. Each jar should be covered with leather or 
a bladder tied firmly over the mouth and kept perfectly dry. 
Each jar should be labeled so that the housekeeper can see at 
once what it contains without being needlessly opened, and those 
that are for present use should be put by themselves. 

The pickles should be taken out with a wooden spoon or fork, and 
should hang over the pickle jars, as spoons of metal injures the 
vinegar, or an earthern bowl with a stout handle is very good. No 
more should be taken out than is likely to be eaten. If left, it is best 
not to return it to the jar. Cover up and keep it for the next meal. 

Pickles should be kept in a cool and dry place, but sunned 
occasionally. Vegetables intended for pickling should not be too

ripe, but sound and firm and gather very early in the morning, and 
on a dry day, guarding against letting them fall or getting bruised in 
any way. Gather them with the stem, else the juice will exude 
and the article wither. They should be carefully culled and wiped 
with a dry cloth, very clean and soft. Do not wash them unles they 
are to be scalded or steeped before pickling, and even this is better 
to be let alone, for the pickles are observed to spoil the sooner by 
it. The purest, best, and strongest vinegar, whether wine or 
cider, should be used and full quantity to more than cover the whole 
contents of the jar. 

Let your articles used in pickling be done sufficiently to be tender 
and wholesome, and not lose their crispness and brittleness. Let 
them be just done through, let it be by simmering, pouring, or boil- 
ing the vinegar, or in whatever way managed. In obtaining a good 
color health is often left out of the question or sacrificed to please 
the eye. The beautiful green, so brilliant and so much admired in 
pickles, is produced artificially by verdigris, formed by boiling 
them in brass, or untinned copper kettles, or by adding pieces of 
brass or copper to the boiling vinegar, though as often detected 
as denied. This green color is poisonous and permeates the whole 
fruit. A good green color may be obtained by placing vine or 
cabbage leaves several thicknesses over boiling vinegar while scald- 
ing the fruit; it is green enough. A small portion of potash will 
promote the much admired color, while it weakens or destroys 
the acid of the vinegar. The fruit may be scalded in alum water, 
after being taken from the vine, before putting them in scalding 
vinegar, then soak them in clear water for a few hours; it toughens 
and makes them more crisp, then scald them in strong cider 
or other vinegar, before putting them in the spiced liquor. If a red 
color is desired put in a few grains of cochineal. Vinegar may be 
allowed to simmer but never to boil, as in boiling a large per cent, 
of the fomented liquors escapes. Cold vinegar becomes thick or 
ropy it added to fruit which requires boiling or more spices. But 
radish pods (which should be very young) and nasturtiums, onions, 
young pods of green pepper and similar articles being of a pungent 
nature, require no spices nor boiling, but may be gathered and 
put in cold vinegar until the jar is full, when it should be closed 
tightly. 

Spices seem to mellow and conteract, and refine the sharpness or 
acidity of pickles. But they should be selected and used to suit 
the quality of flavor of the vegetable which is to be pickled. Such 
as cauliflower, cucumbers, indian pickle, cabbage, &c., requires a 
good portion of spice. But if the spices are cooked in a vessel, 
and steeped in the best cider, wine, or pure vinegar on a hot 
hearth, a small quantity will do.

If pickles are required at a short notice, they should be parboiled 
in a very strong brine of salt and water, but the color is not good, 
and the brittleness is injured. It is an easy way, more wholesome, 
and by many esteemed the most profitable. 

Garlic, in any quantity that you may desire, may be peeled, 
sliced, and laid in brine for three days, of salt and water, then put in 
the sun to dry to be ready when wanted. Long peppers may be 
prepared in the same way.

THE LENGTH OF TIME, WHICH GARDEN SEEDS RETAIN THEIR VI- 
TALITY. Parsnips, rhubarb, or any thin, scaly seeds i year. Bal, 
basil, beans, codroons, carrot, cress, Indian cress, lavender, leeks, 
okra, onions, peas, pepper, rampion, sage, salsify, savoy, scerzancra, 
thyme, tomato, wormwood, and small herbs 2 years. Artichokes, 
asparagus, corn, salad, eggplant, endive, Indian corn, lettuce, mari- 
gold, marjoram, mustard, parsley rosemary, spinach, tansy, borage, 
borecole, Brussel sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, radish, sea kale, tar- 
ragan, turnip 3 years. Beet, celery, cherville, cucumber, dill, fen- 
nel, hyssop, melon, pumpkin, sorrel, squash 5, 8 or 10 years. 

THE best evergreen hedge plant for protecting grapes and dwarf 
pear trees, is the American arbor vitae. 

A TIMELY HINT. In transplanting tomato, cabbage and tobacco 
plants, prepare a vessel of manure water and thicken to the stiffness 
of mush by stirring in rich garden mould; dip the root of the plant 
in this paste before setting it in the ground, press the earth firmly 
round the root and sprinkle with manure water. 

CLAY SOILS need lime, ashes and light composts, such as contain 
straw and partially decayed cornstalks. Black, moist soils being 
cultivated, are generally exhausted of lime and silex. They need 
composts, containing sand and lime in the form of plaster, slaked 
lime or super phosphate. Light sandy soils need well worked com- 
posts containing a large share of muck and manure. .It should cover 
the ground 4 inches deep. 

PRUNING A SUCKER TOMATO. Pinching out the shoots, except 
the 4 main branches, will improve the size and increase the number 
of the fruit. These main branches had better be fastened to stakes, 
or laid on the ground. 

THE ELDER BUSH or leaves, if scattered on cabbage, cucumber, or 
any vines, vegetables, or fruit trees, will cause the insects to leave 
and will drive off the potato bug also. 

DILL AMONG CABBAGE. It is said, that dill, if planted among cab- 
bages, will drive away insects and worms that are destructive to 
them. 



GARDENING. 493 

To GUARD CABBAGES FROM DEPREDATIONS OF THE CATERPILLAR. 
Sow with hemp all the borders of the ground wherein the cabbages 
are planted, and although the neighborhood be infested with cater- 
pillers, the space inclosed with hemp will be perfectly free and not 
one of them will approach it. 

PRESERVATION OF CABBAGES. Cut them so that they may 
have about 2 inches of stem left below the leaves ; scoop out the 
pith as far down as a small knife will reach, then suspend it by means 
of a cord, exactly perpendicular, but in an inverted position and dai- 
ly fill up the hollow part of the stem with clean cold water. It is 
stated that by this method, cabbages, cauliflowers, brocoli, celery, etc. 
may be preserved. 

RHUBARB prefers a light, rich soil. The ground should be heavily 
manured every year. It may be forced, and that which grows in 
pots is more delicate than that grown in the air, if forced in winter 
and spring. It is one of the best and most certain apperients in in- 
fancy, constipation and summer complaints from its astringency, 
for it is both a tonic and astringent, so good in infantile diseases 
attended with imperfect digestion and irritations of the intestinal 
canal. 

CALINAC. This valuable vegetable is yet but little cultivated by 
our gardeners. They, when the roots are boiled tender, are a great 
improvement to soups, meat-pies and skewered meats, or the roots 
are scraped, cut in slices and boiled soft, in milk with a little salt and 
serve hot in butter. 

OSAGE ORANGE SEED. Sow them in drills and cover 2 inches 
deep in the fall season. 

OXALIC ACID AND SEED. Soak them in a solution of oxalic acid 
for a day or two, till they commence to sprout, then take them out 
and plant them. It is said that by this process seeds 40 years old 
have been known to germinate. 

ROSES FROM SEED. To raise roses from seed, take the seed when 
fully ripe, separate them from the pulp, mix them with moist sand 
and put them in a little box or flower pot ; then put them in the cel- 
lar, taking care that they are kept moist all winter and from freezing. 
In the spring sow sand and all in a common hot bed, and when the 
plants are about an inch high, transplant then till well rooted. 

FARMING OR GARDEN TOOLS, when not in use, should be thorough- 
ly wiped and then oileid or greased with anyting that contains no 
salt. 

How THE SANDWICH ISLANDERS GROW WATERMELONS. They 
plant them in the sand. Whether they come in contact with a sub- 
soil and draw nourishment from it, I do not know, but the melon 
grows large, and is very delicious, in its sandy bed, 



494 GARDENING. 

FENNEL. The root of the large fennel is eaten, when blanched, 
like celery or seakale when stewed. 

ARTICHOKE Sow in drills 2 inches in depth. Thin out the 
plants. When they are large enough, they can be reset in rich beds 
m drills, 3 feet apart each way ; the soil should be free from frost, 
and in cold latitudes covered in winter. Jerusalem artichoke in the 
same way. The common artichoke may be planted and cultivated as 
the Irish potato. 

ASPARAGUS. Large. Any time during the fall or winter, sow in 
drills, 8 or 10 inches apart, then cover up with pulverized soil about 
i inch. For one year keep the rows free from grass and weeds. 
Then prepare a permanent bed for the young plants by digging 
trenches 18 inches apart and 10 feet deep, then half fill them with 
manure; on this, place the roots i 1-2 feet apart. Gradually draw 
the soil up to them, as the plants begin to grow, until the bed be- 
comes even. The roots are now deep enough to cultivate over them, 
which should be done a month before the young plants appear. I 
remember that in some ranches about this time, the beds were turn- 
ed over, the tops lightly turned up, and upon this were sown cab- 
bage and lettuce seeds. The asparagus grew in abundance, while 
there were enough cabbage plants to furnish the family garden, and 
lettuce of the best order for the table. Salt, in a small portion, is an 
excellent addition to the soil of an asparagus bed. 

RUNNING BEANS. Haricot. Large white Lima, Dutch case knife, 
red or horticultural cranberry, scarlet runner, French saisson (large), 
German wax (black)". These may best be planted in hills, 2 inches 
deep and 3 feet apart, or in drills i 1-2 feet apart; beans will not 
stand the frost. As soon as they show signs of running, they should 
be stuck with a pole or common brush wood, either green or dry. 

DWARF OR SNAP BEANS. Haricot. Brush cranberry, Chili bayos, 
early yellow six weeks, early turtlesoup, early China (snaps), early 
snap short, early marrowfat (white), English broad Windsor, Prussian 
bean, early valentine, early Mohawk, early horticultural, German 
wax, butter, sword long pod, bush cranberry, royal dwarf or large 
white kidney, French snaps, white and small, fountain, very fine 
snaps ; flagalet ; these should be planted in hills 3 feet apart, or in 
drills, thinned until they stand a foot apart, two feet between each 
drill. 

BEETS. Early blood turnip, white turnip, yellow turnip, extra early 
turnip, long white, long blood, or pink or yellow, long smooth blood, 
white, deep red, white true French sugar beet for making sugar, 
white Siberian sugar beet, long red mangel wurtzel, red globe mangel 
wurtzel, yellow globe mangel wurtzel,long white mangel wurtzel, long 
yellow mangel wurtzel. Prepare your drills i i-a feet apart and sow

ing 1-2 toot between each plant. 

BROCOLI. Early purple, cape, early purple, white cape or cauli- 
flower, early white. Used and cultivated as the cauliflower, which 
it resembles in habit and growth, only the heads are not so firm. 

BRUSSEL OR CABBAGE SPROUTS. Cultivate as the cabbage, to which 
family it belongs, producing numerous small heads on the stem ; the 
top one, cabbage like, in cold climates becomes tender when touch- 
ed by the frost. Borecole, green curled dwarf, or german green. 

CABBAGE. Early York, early large York, early Dutch, fine ; early 
Battesea, early Winningstadt, fine, very hard; early sugarloaf, 
early green globe Savoy, early ox-heart, very fine; large 
ox-head, true French ; large late bergen, early savoy, extra fine late 
drum-head savoy, fine American, premium flat Dutch, largest 
Schweinfurt, Dwarf or large red Dutch for pickling, late Brunswick, 
quintal or hundred pounds, marblehead, cavalier, for stock. The 
drills in which cabbage is sown, should be 4 inches apart. When 
the plants are 6 or 7 inches high, the early kinds should be trans- 
planted in rows 2 feet apart, and the plants i 1-2 feet from each oth- 
er. Late kinds had better be planted in rows 3 feet apart, and the 
plants 2 feet from each other. The ground should be deeply dug 
after being lightly manured, and the plants hoed often. 

CARROT. Long purple, long orange, long streaked, long red, half 
long scarlet point, half long red, large white Belgium, early horn, 
large Altringhain. Sow 3-4 of an inch deep in rows i 1-2 inch 
deep, till deeply in a rich sandy soil. Thin the plants according to 
the desired size of the carrot. 

LARGE CALIFORNIA WOLCHEREN. Large late London, large 
Asiatic, real ; Lenormond, straight stems, fine large heads. Cultivate 
in the same manner as cabbage. 

CELERY. Celery seed for flavoring soup, "red solid, celeriac 
or turnip rooted, giant, white solid American. Sow like cabbage. 
When the plants are 4, 6 or 8 inches high, then make ready trenches 
i foot deep and 4 feet apart, as for asparagus, half fill the trenches 
with rich compost, then set the plants 6 inches apart. To bleach 
their stems, as the plants grow, draw up the soil around them. 

CORN FOR GARDEN CULTURE. Large eight rowed sugar, early 
King Philip, Stowell's evergreen sugar, large sweet or sugar, Dor- 
ling's extra early sugar, early dwarf sugar, pop-corn. Plant 4 or 5 
in a hill 4 feet apart each way, thin to one or two stalks in a hill ; 
hoe often. 

CORN SALAD. Sow in drills i inch deep and 6 inches apart. 

ASPARAGUS BEAN OR DALOCHOS. These beans grow a yard long, 
and may be planted in drills stuck with poles for them to grow up- 
on, as pole beans, and cultivated like them. A good vegetable.

cooked like the tomato, boiled, fried or stewed in sauces. 

ENDIVE. Broad leafed, green curled, summer, white curled, wild 
or chicory, coffee chicory. Sow and thin as lettuce, 8 inches apart. 
Endive and chicory are the same. 

GARLIC. In rows i foot apart, set the plants 6 inches apart ; let 
the soil be light. Take up the roots when the leaves turn yellow. 

KALE. Green curled Scotch, sea kale, blue kale, double kale, 
Siberian or German greens. Cultivate as cabbage ; when young or 
touched by frost, they become very tender when used as greens, and 
are an excellent spring salad. 

TURNIP ROOTED CABBAGE. Long white or green, early white 
Vienna, above ground. As it is difficult to transplant, sow in rows 
where it is to stand, about i 1-2 feet apart, and 8 inches apart in the 
drills. 

LEEK. Large thick winter, best flag, long summer. Sow in drills 
i foot apart and i inch deep. Transplant when 6 inches high, in 
rows 10 inches apart each way, deep as possible, that the neck may 
be blanched by being covered. 

LETTUCE. Royal summer white cabbage head, large white cab- 
bage, green Paris coss, white Paris coss, early curled Siberia, ice 
drum head, very fine; butter or Turkish head cabbage, India head, 
brown Dutch Princess head, Berlin King's head, large Roman, stone 
head, curled Simpson, sugar of Paris, and many other varieties. 
Sow in succession, i inch deep ; when young, transplant 8 inches 
apart, in very rich soil. By thus sowing you can have the vegetable 
all the year. Hog or chicken guano is the best for the purpose. 

MUSH MELON. Pine apple, nutmeg, fine, green citron, large yel- 
low, cantaloupe, large Persian, fine; green flesh cantaloupe, the 
best; Skillman's fine netted, rock mush melon, Chinese, very good, 
and many others. Plant in hills 4 feet apart, (each having 2 shovels

mixed with dry dirt, sand or ashes; or 1-2 inch deep in drills 18 
inches apart. Thin the plants to 5 or 6 inches in the row. Ruta- 
bagas 10 inches apart in the row; when sown in beds, are never 
worked. 

WATERMELONS. Jackson, Washington, Winston, Ice Cream or 
Mountain Sweet, York River, Long Island common, Black Spanish, 
Shanghai, Orange, fine ; Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennes- 
see, Georgia, Florida, Carolina, melons, striped Gipsey for orna- 
ment, Citron for preserves an endless variety. Plant the seed in 
hills, 6 feet apart each way. The hills should be dug 2 feet deep 
and filled with manure, mixed with 1-4 soil. I have seen them 
so large that one man could scarcely lift them ; had to be hand- 
led in tubs or baskets. 

MUSHROOM SPAWN. Make a bed of warm manure about one 
foot deep and covered with fine soil about 2 inches deep ; through 
this spread the spawn. It does best under cover. 

MUSTARD. White London, brown, black. Sow in drills i foot 
apart and cover 1-2 inch deep. 

NASTURTIUM. Tall and dwarf. In drills i inch deep ; a beau- 
tiful garnish and relish for cold meats.

ONION. Yellow danders, Bombay onion, large white Portugal, 
large red Wetherfield, white Silver skins, large yellow Dutch, yellow 
Silver peel, vegetable onions, Statar onions, top onions. Onion's 
will succeed well when cultivated on the same ground for a number 
of years, and thrive best in strong, deep, rich, loamy soil. Set the 
onions or cloves bulbs 3 or 4 inches apart ; when propagated from 
seed, sow thinly in drills i foot apart and i inch deep. Thin to the 
same distance apart as the bulbs. Do not let the soil become too 
hard about the bulbs, nor stir them too deep. Keep free from weeds. 
Some cover them up in beds in the fall with straw, like Irish pota- 
toes. 



498 GARDENING. 

PARSLEY. Extra curled'and plain. As the seed germinate slowly 
soak them in milk or luke-warm water before sowing them 1-2 inch 
deep in drills, i foot apart. For family use prepare a bed of rich 
soil and sow the seed, and let the plants remain for years ; gather 
the seeds when in perfection. The roots continue to germinate for 
a series of years. 

PARSNIPS. Long, smooth white, early round, Guernsey or cup. 
Sow in drills 8 inches apart and i inch deep. The soil should be deep 
and rich. When well up, thin the plants to 5 inches or more apart 
in the rows. 

PEAS Early. Prince Albert (early), Kent, extra early Emperor, 
Daniel O'Rouke, Mag, Double blossom frame, Bishop's early, Dwarf

pea. Sow every 2 or 3 weeks, or every week, in any warm month for a 
succession of crops. A light, dry soil, not too rich, suits best. Sow 
in rows from 2 to 4 feet apart, according to the variety. The pea 
is a hardy plant and will endure frost a little. 

PEPPER. Sweet Spanish for salad, large Squash for mangoes, 
Sweet Mountain for the same purpose, Small Chile, Large Bell, 
Cherry, Oxheart, Capsicum, Long Cayenne, small, for pepper sauce. 
Sow in small beds; when 3 or 4 inches high transplant to 18

ble winter vegetable. 

POTATO, IRISH. Early Rose, Utah, Early Goodrich, Nansomend, 
the Murcer.and endless numbers. Always plant in a sandy or loamy 
soil ; apply to each hill a double handful of plaster or ashes when 
the plants appear above ground. Hoe often. Keep free from grass 
and weeds. 

POTATO, SWEET. Make a hot bed to raise the plant from, or plant 
them with small potatoes in hills in sandy or loamy soil about 18 
inches apart ; do not cover them very deep. In the Southern 
States they raise them in the greatest perfection. They set them 
in drills, covering the end of slips that may be a yard long be-

fore the dry season sets in. They have them the year round, 
and are as sweet as honey. The names would be too tedious to 
mention, as they are so numerous as well as the kinds. Only culti- 
vate them in California in the manner of those warm states, and they 
will succeed as well as there. Keep them free from grass and 
weeds ; hoe often. 

RADISH. Long scarlet short top, early deep scarlet, olive shaped 
Chinese winter, half long scarlet, the best; long salmon, black 
Spanish, white Spanish, early demi long rose, yellow summer turnip, 
white summer turnip, early scarlet turnip, rooted ; French break- 
fast. Sow in the best sandy loam in drills from six to twelve 
inches apart, and thin the plant three or four inches apart in the 
row, according to the kind. Sow twice a month for a succession 
of crops. Sand keeps the roots free from the destroying worm. 

RHUBARB. Linneas, Giant and MitchePs Royal Albert. The 
soil should be deep and cannot be too rich. Make a bed and sow 
the seed i inch deep in drills 18 inches apart; when large enough 
thin the plants to 8 inches apart in the row. After a year dig trenches 
2 feet deep and manure plentifully, then take up the plants and set 
them in the trenches 3 feet apart each way ; manure liberally each 
season. 

SALSIFY OR OYSTER VEGETABLE. Long white. In hills i foot 
apart, i inch deep ; thin to 6 or 8 inches apart in the row. The soil 
should be rich and light. 

SAGE. Make a bed and sow in drills i foot apart, 1-2 inch deep ; 
thin the plant to equal distances in each row. 

SAVORY. Summer and winter. Cultivate as sage. 

SCORZARERA. Cultivate in the same way as salsify. 

SORREL. In drills 8 inches apart ; cover lightly. 

SPINACH. Large Flanders, fine, round-leafed, prickly lettuce- 
leaved. In drills i inch apart ; sow i inch deep ; sow frequently 
succession. The soil should be rich and deep.

early white scolloped bush, summer crook neck, Scotch bonnet; win- 
ter crook neck, Boston marrow, Manmoth Chili (200 specimens), 
Hubbard, vegetable marrow ; bunch squash or cymlings, Valparaisa. 
Cultivate in hills or drills as melons. The bunch or bush varieties ; 
4 or 6 feet apart, and the other er running varieties 6 to 8 feet apart. 

SWEET MARJORAM. Cultivate as sage. Thyme in the same 
way. 

TOBACCO. Hanover, Virginia, Maryland, Kentucky, Ohio. The 
The soil for this "Virginia weed" should be of the best quality to 
raise fine tobacco. To raise coarse and large plants the soil should 
be strong, rich and highly manured. Plant in hills or drills ; the

former is the usual way. The plant set in hills or drills 4 feet apart. 
The plant cannot be too assiduously and carefully cultivated. In 
setting out it is best to plant two in a hill, lest one should die. It 
can be uprooted afterwards. The beet seeds are the Kiblefoot, the 
white stem, long and short Frederic, Oronoco, James river, &c. 

TOMATO. Large red smooth, mammoth red, large early red, red 
cherry, large yellow, Fiji island, yellow cherry, yellow plum, red 
plum, trophy, new and fine, pear-shaped yellow and red, small 
round red or Brazil, upright deloya, Southern tomato. Sow in a 
box in the house or hot-bed ; when the plants are five or six inches 
high, transplant them five inches apart into boxes, to gradually harden 
them, before finally setting out; when the weather is warm and set- 
tled, transplant them again four feet each way, in a light loamy soil, 
manured liberally, and cultivate well and with care. I have culti- 
vated 22 kinds of tomatoes at one time. The purple and large yel- 
low are valuable for table use. 

BEES. 

ON THE MANAGEMENT OF BEES THAT REFUSE TO SWARM. If the 

hive is an old one, and an early supply of honey be desired, the best 
plan to be adopted is that of driving out the greater portion of the 
bees, and so forming a new swarm artificially ; if the remainder of 
the bees be driven out, three weeks afterwards, the hive will be found 
perfectly full of honey, and there will be found no grubs or larvae. 
The bees driven out on the second occasion can be added to those 
first driven out, or to any weak store that requires strengthening. 
We have just performed this operation on one of our own hives, 
and have taken upwards of 60 pounds of honey without having to 
destroy a single grub. There is no doubt whatever, that where hives 
are employed that do not admit of being sapered, there is no more 
profitable mode of management than the one above recommended. 
The Field. 

THK BEE luxuriates on the bloom of clover fields, fruit blossoms, 
buckwheat flowers, minicaette, lemon, thyme, bean flowers, mign- 
onette, borage, sage, mellow fruits, and all kinds of fragrant 
shrubs and flowers. 

HONEY should be on every table, not only as a luxury, but a 
healthy article everywhere. The process for keeping it in all its 
freshness the year round should be known to every housekeeper^ 
so that every family may be able to make their own honey. It 
should be run through a sieve in order to get out all the wax ; 
boil gently in an earthen or copper kettle, then pour into another 
vessel; set away in a cool place, tightly covered; the next day 



RATS AND MICE. 5OI 

uncover the vessel and gently remove the crust of wax on the 
top, and pour the honey into large jars or carboys ; leave this 
open, and in a few days all the sediment will be thrown from the 
top, which remove, and cork and seal closely. 

BEES AND SOILS. Flowers that grow on rich soils are much more 
visited than those that grow on poor soils, such as buckwheat clo- 
ver, fruit trees, berry bushes, vines, rosemary, broom, bean flowers, 
mignonnette, lemon, thyme, &c., &c. As bees seldom fly more than 
a mile for food, it is best to grow what they love most around or 
near them. 

To PRESERVE BEES FROM WORMS. About the first of May raise 
the hive up and strew some fine salt under the edge. 

To CHLOROFORM BEES.- --The quantity of chloroform required for 
an ordinary hive is the sixth part of an ounce. A very large hive 
may take nearly a quarter of an ounce. Set down a table opposite 
to and about four feet distant from the hive: on the table spread a 
thick linen cloth ; in the center of table place a shallow breakfast 
plate, which cover with a piece of wire gauze to prevent the bees 
from coming in immediate contact with the chloroform ; now quickly 
and cautiously lift the hive from the board on which it is standing, 
set it down on the top of the table, keeping the plate in the center ; 
cover the hive closely up with cloths, and in 20 minutes or so the 
bees are not only sound asleep, but not one is left among the combs ; 
the whole of them are lying helpless on the table. You may now 
remove what honey you think fit ; replace the hive in its old stand, 
and the bees, as they revive, will return to their domicile. A bright, 
calm sunny day is the best ; and you should commence your opera- 
tions early in the morning, before any of them are abroad. 

BEES AND SUGAR. Bees confined to a dish of purified sugar will 
continue to produce wax. 

LARGE PODDED MILK OR SILK WEED AND BEES. This weed is 
said to be certain death to every bee that lights on it. They pull 
off their feet in trying to get off from it. Kill the weed is the only 
remedy. 

RATS AND MICE. 

To DRIVE AWAY RATS. Saturate cotton wool with powdered red 
pepper and stuff it in their holes. 

DESTROYING RATS. Corks cut in thin slices and stewed or roasted 
in grease and placed in their tracks, or dried sponge, in small pieces, 
fried or dipped in honey, with a little of the oil of rhodium laid in 
their haunts, will stick to their feet and cause them to leav,e ; or rub 
well a live rat with fat or train oil, and let him escape in "his hole, 
and all others will make their exit. 



502 CANARY BIRDS. 

POWDERED POTASH. If powdered, thrown and scattered in the- 
haunts of rats, it will drive them away. 

DEAD RATS. To free a room from the smell. Take a small 
earthern vessel into which put saltpetre, a little, or more accord- 
ing to the size of the room; pour upon this enough oil of vitrol to 
separate it, and shut the room close for one hour, the offensive 
smell will be gone. 

To DESTROY RATS. Cats are the most reliable rat-traps. There 
is no difficulty in poisoning rats, but they die in the wall, produc- 
ing a dreadful effluvia, which it takes a long time to get rid of; 
remove or cover all water vessels, even the well or cistern, when 
poison is attempted. Set traps and put inside a few drops of 
rhodium the rats are fond of it. As it produces thirst, let a large 
shallow open vessel of water be left in the rear yard. They will 
drink and die there. 

To DRIVE AWAY RATS. Put chloride of lime in their holes. 

BAIT FO CATCH RATS AND MICE. If a drop of oil of rhodium be 
poured upon some bait in a common wire or spring trap, and the 
trap be set in an infested locality, and in a short time the cage will 
be occupied by vermin. Rats and mice possess great liking for the 
oil and will risk anything to obtain it. 

CANARY BIRDS. 

CANARY, TO DISTINGUISH THE SEX. The throat of the male 
vibrates while singing. This never happens with the hen. The 
males are larger, more yellow about the throat and in the pinions of 
the wings. The body of the male is larger and more tapering. 

BEST SINGERS. Birds with long, straight and tapering bodies are 
the best singers. By putting 2 or 3 birds together they will vie with 
each other. 

DROOPING. When this is the case, give the bird a little powdered 
charcoal mixed with bread and egg. 

LICE. Put sticks in the bottom of the cage, and the lice will col- 
lect on them. 

FOR A BROKEN LEG OR WING. Put the bird in a cage without 
perches and covered at the bottom with soft hay. Let its food be 
within easy reach, and keep the cage covered. 

MOULTING. A void cold; give plenty of sun shine, some bread 
and egg, with saffron water. 

FITS. Cut two of the claws short enough to bleed. 

EGG-BOUND FROM COLD. Give a little moist sugar ; anoint the 
abdomen* with sweet oil; if this fails, give a drop of castor oil. 

IRON DUST. Mixed in with the straw for bird's or canary's nests

will prevent their being infested by vermin, and render the parent 
and birdlings more healthy. 

GERMAN PASTE FOH FBEDING SINGING BIRDS. Blanch i pound 
sweet almonds, 2 pounds of peasmeal, 3 ounces of butter, a few 
grains of saffron, honey, a sufficient quantity. Form the whole into 
a paste, and granulate it by pressing through a colander. Some add 
the yolks of 2 eggs. 

TEACHING BIRDS TO SING A German method. The young 
birds are divided into classes, from 6 to 10 each, and are kept in the 
dark. As they are fed a small organ is played. The birds begin 
to associate the music with the feeding, and when hungry they begin 
to sing a few notes of the tune they hear daily. They are then placed 
in a room where light is admitted. This seems to render them more 
lively. Then they are taught additional music, and enjoy singing. 
The most difficult task is starting the birds. Some are kept for a 
long time in the dark and on starving rations before their stupidity 
or obstinacy can be overcome. 

CANARY BIRDS, TO MAKE THEM COLORED. A Berlin recipe. 
Give them a little cayenne pepper regularly. This will cause them 
to lose their feathers, but after a short time new ones begin to grow, 
and the birds come out with a new plumage, with all the vivid col- 
ors of the parrot and cockatoos. Some are a light brown, others 
vermillion red, &c. It is known that the bright colors of tropical 
birds are owing to the oils in certain spices upon which they feed. 

MOULTING CANARIES. When your canary birds are moulting and 
cease to sing, do this : Put a little oxide of iron (iron rust from the 
drug store), or let a couple of nails be in the water they drink ; re- 
move their bath-tub so that nothing remains to drink but the iron 
water. To give color to the incoming feathers, put some saffron in 
water'in another bath-tub. The birds suffer from fever while moult- 
ing, and the iron braces them. After restored to health they will 
sing very loud and almost continually. 

To TEACH A PARROT TO SPEAK. The quickest way is to send th 
bird, if possible, where there is another parrot that can speak. They 
should be placed near enough to hear, but not to see each other. A 
good way is to speak to the bird at night, just when his cage has 
been covered over (which must always be done with a woolen cloth 
in winter) ; repeat over several times in the same tone the sentence 
which you wish him to learn. He may not appear to" notice atfirst, 
but some day, quite unexpectedly, he will repeat the sentence ex- 
actly in the same tone that he has heard it. He should at once b 
rewarded with a bit of sugar, fruit or dainty that he is fond of. They 
are very quick at understanding that rewards are given for obedi- 
ence. Never allow a parrot to be startled or teased, or permit it to 



FORCEMEATS OR STUFFING. 

be indiscriminately fed by visitors. Keep the cage extremely clean; 
let it be wiped out and fresh sand be given every day. Some birds 
drink very little, but they should always be able to get a drink of 
fresh water, if they wish. Keep the canary can full of seed. The 
bread and milk, in the morning, should not be forgotten. 

FOOD FOR MOCKING BIRDS. Mix together 2 parts corn meal, 2 
parts peasmeal and i part moss meal ; add a little melted lard, but 
not sufficient to make the mixture too greasy, and sweeten with mo- 
lasses. Fry in a frying-pan for 1-2 hour, stirring constantly, and 
taking care not to let it burn. This makes it keep well. Put it in 
a covered jar. The moss-meal is prepared by drying and grinding 
the imported German moss seed. Peas boiled and mashed are as 
good as the meal for the preparation. 

FRUIT FOR BIRDS. The dwarf mountain June berry, the huckle- 
berry, red mulberry and elderberries are a healthy diet, and are 
much liked by birds, and it behooves those who keep them to cater 
to their tastes, and these things are cheap, and can be easily grown 
for them. 

FORCEMEATS OR STUFFING. 

THE STUFFING FOR TOMATOES. Remove the part next to the 
stem with a sharp knife, then with a teaspoon carefully take out the 
seed, so as not to break the rind of the fruit ; then place these in 
order around a frying pan with a spoonful of butter or a jill of sweet 
oil; then chop up some mush, a handful of parsley, and four shalots 
or some chives, a good spoonful of fat bacon that has been scraped, 
say 2 oz., and the same quantity of lean ham, grated or ground or 
chopped ; season with a little thyme chopped fine, salt, pepper and a 
little nutmeg (if fancied). Fry these over the stove for five minutes, 
then mix in the yolks of 4 well beaten eggs, till the ingredients are 
a smooth batter ; fill the tomato rinds with it, then shake over them 
some light brown raspings of bread, then set the pan over a brisk 
fire, holding a red-hot salamander over them for ten minutes; then 
serve hot, or use as you wish for pig or fowl.' 

PANADA FOR FORCEMEATS. Put 2-3 of a cup of water into a 
quart stew-pan, with a moderate spoonful of butter, when boiling, 
stir in 4 oz. of flour, stirring it constantly until done and smooth. 
Pour it out of the pan to cool, and use as wished. 

FOR HARE OR ANYTHING IN IMITATION OF IT. Take scalded 
liver, an anchovy, some fat bacon, a little salt, some parsley, thyme, 
knitted marjoram, a little sholot, and either onion or chives, all 
chopped fine; crumbs of bread, pepper and nutmeg, beat in a mortar 
with eggs. This is very fine for stuffing veal or mutton ham. 

STUFFING FOR GAME, TURKEY, VEAL AND BAKED FISH. Equal 



FORCEMEATS OR STUFFING. 505 

quantities of beef suet (chopped very fine) and bread crumbs, and 
1-4 the quantity of either of chopped parsley, a tablespoonful of each 
of powdered thyme and marjoram, a bay leaf, the rind of one lemon 
grated, and the juice of half an one, 1-4 grated nutmeg, pepper and 
salt to taste, then stir well into the whole three well beaten eggs ; if 
used to fill turkey or fish add more chopped parsley, 

STUFFING OF FISH. This can be made of the flesh of almost any 
kind of fish, namely, the pike, salmon, haddock, sole, trout, and the 
whiting. The flesh of either after the skin is removed, should be 
beaten to a pulp in a mortar, then take it and form it to a ball, then 
take a piece of panada about one-third the size of the ball, and 
pound that well, then add a tablespoonful of butter, then mix thor- 
oughly with the panada, then put in the fish, season to taste with 
pepper and salt and a little grated nutmeg; then mix all well to- 
gether, then slowly add three whole well beaten eggs and the yolks 
of two. This forms excellent stuffing for any kind of fish. 

FOR FISH. Chip, and afterwards pound in a mortar, any kind of 
fish, adding an anchovy or two, or a teaspoonful of the essence of 
anchovies (but do not allow the taste to prevail) and the yolk of a 
hard boiled egg; if for the maigre, pound butter with it ; but other- 
wise, the fat of bacon pounded separately and then mixed ; add a 
third portion of bread, prepared by previously pounding and soak- 
ing, and mix the whole up with raw eggs. 

CORN BREAD STUFFING FOR TURKEYS AND CHICKENS. Take the 
crumb of corn bread and make it rich with new butter, suet, or lard, 
pepper, salt, and onions. It is an excellent stuffing. 

STUFFING FOR TURKEY OR CHICKEN. Mrs. J. D. Thornton, Col. 
A loaf of bread grated or broken very fine, seasoned only with 
pepper and salt, and thoroughly moistoned with fresh butter, well 
rubbed into it. 

OYSTERS MAKE AN EXCELLENT STUFFING FOR TURKEY, GOOSE OR 
YOUNG FOWLS. Having prepared a young fat fowl for boiling, fill 
the body and breast with oysters, flavored with some pounded mace. 
Sew up the places to keep them in. Put the fowl in a tall, straight 
jar, and cover closely, then set the jar in a kettle of water setting 
over the fire, and let it boil for at least 11-2 hours after it has be- 
gun to boil hard, stick a fork in the fowl, and if the holes close up, 
then it it is done, take it up, and keep it hot while you prepare the 
gravy from the juice left in the jar. Pour this in a sauce pan, beat 
2 yolks of egg in a half cup of new cream, and add a large table- 
spoonful of butter formed into a paste with flour; mix this with the 
gravy in the saucepan. If cream is not to be had, double your por- 
tion of butter. After scalding this over the fire, continue to skim it 
well, and add 20 oysters or more chopped fine, when the gravy 



506 FORCEMEATS OR STUFFING. 

comes to a boil. In five minutes it will be ready for serving with 
the fowl. If cooked according to recipe, it will be found excellent. 
If clams are substituted for oysters, they should be removed from 
the fowl before sending them to the table, as they become tough, 
and flavorless, and should not be eaten while the juice runs into the 
gravy. 

ONION STUFFING. After peeling twelve large perfectly sound 
onions, parboil them for 15 minutes then lay them in a cloth to dry. 
Mince finely cold roast veal, beef, or fowl, with sage, three hard 
boiled eggs, grated, and grated crumbs of bread. Season with grat- 
ed nutmeg and mace, or pepper and salt. Then remove the inside 
of each onion, so as not to spoil the outside and fill them with the 
preparation. Set them in a pan and boil them in milk till done; when 
the milk simmers, add some butter made into a paste with flour. 
Serve upon buttered toast, or the onions with the ingredients can 
be made into a stuffing for a fowl. 

FORCE MEAT BALLS FOR FISH SOUPS. Or fish stewed during 
Lent. Beat the flesh and soft parts of a middling lobster; one-half 
of a herring, a large piece of boiled celery, the yolk of a hard 
egg, a little cayenne, mace, salt, and white pepper, with 2 table- 
spoonfuls of bread crumbs, i spoonful of oyster liquor, 2 spoonfuls 
butter warmed, and 2 eggs long beaten; make into balls, fry of a fine 
brown in butter. 

LITTLE EGGS FOR TURTLE. Boil 3 hard yolks of eggs in a mortar 
and make into a paste with the yolk of a raw one, roll into small 
ball and throw them into boiling water for 2 minutes to harden. 

DRESSING FOR TURKEY. (C. Kennicot.)- One pint of soaked 
bread, 2 tablespoonfuls of sage, 2 tablespoonfuls of summer savory, 
2 teaspoonfuls of salt, 2 teaspoonsful of pepper, butter the size of 
an egg ; mix thoroughly. 

THE STUFFING. The liver and heart chopped fine, and bread 
crumbs; soften it with milk; take the bread out and mix with 1-2 
pound of sausage meat, onion and^ parsley, chopped fine, simmered 
in butter ; put in a dish ; add salt and pepper, 2 or 3 eggs ; fill up 
the turkey before it is cooked. 

HACHIS. (French.) Take any sort of meat, game or poultry 
that has been washed or otherwise dressed, and chop up fine ; re- 
move the skins and strings, add sausage, season with parsley, and 
green onions, and bread crumbs and 2 or 3 eggs beaten up, accord- 
ing to the meat. Put it into a saucepan and fry with a bit of butter 
and a pinch of flour ; pour in broth and let it simmer for one-half 
hour over a good fire. This may be used as stuffing for goose or 
turkey, with a little lemon squeezed over it. 

FORCEMEAT FOR FOWLS. (A Hamburg Recipe.) Take soaked 



POULTRY. 57 

bread, drain, put in fat or butter, parsley and onions ; make hot in 
the pan ; then put the soaked bread crumbs, 2 eggs, or more, well 
beaten; salt and pepper to taste; mix well, put in the fowl and 

bake. 

FILLING FOR FOWLS OF ANY KIND. One quart sweet milk, 3-4 
cup corn starch, 4 eggs, sugar and flour to suit. 

FORCEMEAT BALLS. Season the minced, beaten, or ground meat 
with pepper, salt, and a few drops of lemon juice; i beaten egg, and 
make it in balls, which roll into marble size, throw into boiling 
water for five minutes, then lay them in a tureen, pour the soup over, 
lay slices of lemon on top. Serve separate on a small dish. Ex- 
cellent. 

PRAIRIE CHICKEN. Roast and dress as common chicken ; use 

the same stuffing. ( 

BALLS TO Go WITH GAME. Half pound of stale bread crumbs, i 
lb. of beefs or calfs liver, 10 oz. of fat bacon, some parsley, thyme, 
nutmeg, lemon peel, i bay leaf, a little sweet basil, and chopped fine ; 
pepper, salt, yolks of 3 eggs beaten ; mix the whole thoroughly and 
make into small, round balls ; dip in rice, or wheat flour, then fry a 
light brown. 

TUREEN OF GAME. Bone and stuff your bird with forcemeat and 
season as other birds, then use a coarse pie dish with the forcemeat 
and lay in the bird, then put over it some more forcemeat, with a 
spoonful of butter, and a bay leaf on the top, and put a belt of coarse 
flour paste inside of the rim of the pan, then bake it 3 hours in a 
moderate stove. This should be open a week afterwards (if the 
weather be cool), and it will be found to be delicious. When served 
the bird and dressing should remain in the baking dish, the top be- 
ing taken off; remove the bay leaf, and lay fresh water cresses over. 
N. B. All sorts of meat, poultry and game may be done in the 
same way. This is not only quickly done, but it is both good and 
economical, and at the same time it will keep a long time.

RATIONAL RULES FOR POULTRY BREEDERS. i. Feed regularly, 
2. Roosts from the ground. 3. Nests on the ground. 4. Whitewash 
your poultry house outside if you want to keep the boards from split- 
ting. 5. Whitewash the house inside. 6. Feed plenty of green food. 
7. Never overfeed. 8. Fresh water daily. 9. Have a dust-bath in 
your fowl house. 10. Never train your cocks to fight, n. Give stim- 
ulating food when moulting. 12. Make cleanliness a specialty. 
i3.Clean out your fowl house once a week. 14. Breed to the 
standard. 



508 POULTRY. 

RAISING POULTRY. It is best to have a number of partitions in a 
long building, with a long row of nests ; the eggs can be gathered at 
night and sent fresh the next morning to market. Wheat shorts, 
meat scraps, meal corn, and other varieties of grain, with broken 
oyster shells and calcined bone, should be given them in abundance; 
these, with cleanliness, are the strong points of good poultry man- 
agement. Disinfectants should be freely used. 

THE NETTLE is of value as food for poultry, turkeys and hogs. 

CONDIMENTS IN POULTRY DIET. Poultry World. Cayenne gp- 
per, ginger, pepper, mustard, can, with good benefit, be added to 
the food of fowls to increase their vigor and to stimulate egg pro- 
duction. This apparently artificial diet will be' seen to be natural, if 
we remember that wild fowl of the gallinivorous species get access 
to very high spiced berries and buds, articles that give the ''game 
flavor" to their flesh. A moderate quantity of cayenne pepper ad- 
ded to the ground grain is always productive of health and vigor in 
poultry. 

FOOD FOR POULTRY OR TURKEYS. Feed the hen with coarse corn 
meal until satisfied, and her brood with finely chopped hard boiled 
eggs. Milk is better for them to drink than water; boiled potatoes 
mixed with milk, clabber, stale meat or bread are all good. Now 
and then give them alum water and pepper in their food. Allow 
2 1-2 tablespoonfuls of alum to 2 pints of water. 

To FATTEN POULTRY. Make a row of coops with baths on sunny 
side of barn, large enough only to admit the fowls standing on a 
perch in some and not to turn or not to get down ; feed from 4 to 5 
times a day at regular times with different kinds of food each time, 
(cooked), sufficient for one meal. In 2 weeks they will increas 75 
per cent. 

To PATTEN FOWLS IN A SHORT TIME. Mix well together ground 
rice scalded in milk and add some coarse sugar. Feed them with 
this in the day time, but not too much at a time. Let it be pretty 
thick. 

* WORMS FOR FOWLS. During moulting season give them minced 
raw meat ; if fowls run on grass, where they can get worms and 
insects, they do not need so much meat. The Chinese feed their 
fowls and cage birds a great deal on the silk worm or grub. As it 
comes out of the cocoon they dry, press and put it away for future 
use. The Chinese use meat o"hly four times a lunar month. 

FASTING FOWLS. Should have for several hours, only a small 
portion of soft bread wet up with milk, a teacupful at a time; this serves 
both as food and drink. If the fowls suffer much from the effects of 
fasting or a long journey, give them ale and bread, instead of 
bread and water. 



POULTRY. 59 

YOUNG TURKEYS, FOOD FOR. Hard boiled egg, cheese crust, 
stale bread, cracked wheat, onions, leeks, all cut short and fine, and 
moistened a little with water. Feed them for a month with the 
mixture, keeping them out of the dew. 

YOUNG TURKEYS Should not be permitted to run out on the 
grass before 10 o'clock in the morning, until they are ten days old. 
To FATTEN DUCKS AND GEE;E. An English method. Boil 
slightly the leaves of lettuce and cabbage with carrots, all chopped 
fine, and feed them. The leaves of carrots chopped, are also good 
when boiled with a little grain. N. B. Ten days before killing 
them, give them nothing but chopped carrots. It makes the flesh 
delicious. 

YOUNG DUCKS. C. Faidener. The best food for young ducks is 
oat meal. If they are hatched under a hen, you may let them be at 
liberty with her, providing them with oat meal mixed with water in a 
plate. If there is water they (to the hen's great discomfort) will 
dabble about on the edge of it, and find some food. If hatched 
under a duck, the safest plan is to confine them for a fortnight in 
old place, such as a pig stye, where the faulty paving or earth allows 
of p'uddles. They must be fed here in the same way. The objec- 
tion to a duck being at liberty with her brood is, she drags them about 
evenings when the flies are about, she takes them under beetling banks, - 
and often leaves some behind. When there is only a small and open 
pen, the duck may be safely left at liberty with her brood. 

KILLING FOWLS. Only turkeys and geese should be bled to 
death; the flesh of chickens becomes dry and insipid from the loss of 
blood. The best plan is to take a flat stick, and strike the bird a 
smart blow on the back of the neck about the third joint from 
the head; death follows in a moment. 

To PICK A CHICKEN. By means of a knife, remove all the 
fine hairs from the head, take out the eyes, cut off the under 
bill and the tongue^ now place the chicken on its breast, cut the skin 
off the back of the neck lengthwise, from the point where the neck 
and back meet, to the head, loosen the craw carefully, without 
breaking it, and remove it at once; then lay the chicken on its back, 
cut open the body a little, and singe on all sides, wash it clean, and 
let the water drain off. Clean the heart and liver, remove the gall 
carefully from the liver, and put them into the body of the chicken 
and prepare it for roasting. 

To CURE CATS FROM CATCHING CHICKENS. When given to the 
practice, catch a chicken and tie it around the cat's neck ; fasten it 
securely and make her wear it 2 or 3 days. 

CLEANSE the chicken coops or houses. Never put a new supply of 
food on an old one which has become sour or tainted from stand- 



5IO POULTRY. 

ing, but clean and wash all the food out. Scrape out the corners, 
that all the offensive or stale matter may be removed. Wash with 
hot water and add a handful of caustic lime and sprinkle over the 
bottom. 

EGG BOUND FOWLS. Give a dose of .castor oil; if this does not 
do, inject 2 tablespoonfuls of warm olive oil against the egg by 
means of a syringe. Should there be a rupture, keep the bird quiet. 
Give sufficient opium for this purpose beginning with 1-2 grain dose; 
to prevent inflamation, feed low. 

HATCHING COLD EGGS. When a hen leaves her nest for a day or 
two remove them to a hot oven of 95 degrees and they will hatch 
themselves. 

CHOICE OF EGGS FOR SETTING. Round, short, smooth shelled 
eggs alone are proper for hatching. Avoid long rough shelled ones 
for this purpose. 

To MAKE HENS LAY. Boil some oats till soft, then fry them in hot 
fat and you will have any quantity of eggs. 

To PRESERVE EGGS. Pack them away in dry plaster in a dry 
place ; they will keep a year, 

PARISIAN MODE OF PRESERVING EGGS. Dissolve 1-4 Ib. of bees 
wax in 1-2 Ib. of warm olive oil ; in this put the tip of the finger and 
anoint the egg all around. The oil will be completely absorbed by 
the shell and the pores filled up by the wax. If kept in a cool dry 
place, the eggs, after 2 years will be as good as if fresh laid. 

To PREVENT GAPES. Apply to the heads of the chickens an oint- 
ment composed of i oz. each of mercurial ointment and pure lard, 
1-2 oz. of sulphur flowers, 1-2 oz. crude petroleum. 

A CURTAIN CURE FOR GAPING. Is the vapor from carbolic acid ; 
place a little of the crystalized acid in a spoon or metal saucer, hold 
it over a candle or lamp ; hold the bird so that it will be obliged to 
inhale the fumes, being careful not to protract it so long as to kill 
the chick. Generally one application is sufficient. 

GAPES in chickens is believed to be caused by a worm, the pro- 
genitor of which is a louse found on the head of chickens soon after 
hatching. This louse deposits its eggs in the nostril of the chicken, 
where it hatches, and the resulting worms are worked back into the 
trachea of the bird, causing gapes and finally suffocation; and these 
lice should be bestroyed by being picked off. 

CHICKEN CHOLERA. Make a decoction of smart weed as strong 
as can be ; then mix the meal with it to feed the chickens. Allow 
2 or 3 pints to 2 or 3 gallons of meal. To not suffer it to become 
sour, but make a new supply ; feed the fowls with it 2 or 3 times a 
day. 

DISTEMPER IN GEESE OR GARCIL. Pound together several cloves 



POULTRY. 



of garlic and some sweet butter, then form them into little balls and 
give them to the geese while fasting, nor should they take food 3 or 

4 hours after. 

FRACTURED BONES. Poultry World. There is no mystery about 
the treatment of a broken bone ; it will heal any way, the time vary- 
ing according to the age and quiet of the fowl, and the deformity 
upon the degree of displacement of the fracture. In keeping the 
ends of a broken bone together, the breeder will have an oportumty 
to draw on his mechanical skill, but will find that his restless patient 
will generally leave his limbs deformed. The best results come 
from broken shanks. 

BROWN paper saturated with white of egg and suffered to harden 
makes a good enough splint; pasteboard wet and molded to the 
shape of the limb is good. In cases of broken wings tie the feathers 
together about an inch fr/>m the end. Fowls with limbs deformed 
from fracture, breed well enough. 

FOR FOWL AILMENTS. Give in the form of pills a few drops of 
crude kerosine oil or spirits of camphor mixed with corn mea 
bread crumbs, and put down the throat of the fowl No diseased 
fowl should be allowed to go with the well ones, but placed in a dry 
coop, and give it cooked food warmly soiced with red pepper or 
spirits of camphor. . 

BROKEN EGGS. While setting can be made secure by placing a 
niece of court-plaster over the broken shell. 

P CHICKEN LicE.-Give a heaped teaspoonful of powdered sulphur 
mixed in meal for every 10 hens once a week. 

THE DISEASES OF FOWLS AND HOW TO CARE FOR THEM. 1 he C 
eases to which they are most subject are roop, pip, scounng and chip. 
The first arises from cold, and is the most common of all, and 
eves become swollen, the nostrils run and the wattle turn of a purp- 
h hue Chickens or fowls, if affected, should be separated imme- 
diately from the healthy fowl, for the disease at its height is as infec- 
tious as the epizootic or glanders among horses. Bathe the nose 
and eyes of the sick fowl with milk and warm water and each day 
g?ve it a pepper corn in its dough. Bathe the head in brandy and 
water if much swollen, and while getting well put a spoonful of sul- 
phur in his drinking water. The eggs laid by hens that are diseased 
should be thrown away ; they are unwholesome confined for awhile 
PouHry should never be underfed, but have a liberal supply of good 
solid food, and those intended for killing and for laying early should 
always be kept in a good condition. Oat meal or barley meal 
wiTh mashed potatoes are good. Old bones for them to pick, and 
the lights and livers of beef are good for them. 



5 12 POULTRY. 

THE MANAGEMENT OF POULTRY. They must be provided for 
carefully, both by proper lodging and feeding. The chief points 
required are ist, a warm and dry lodging ; 2d, proper vegetable 
and animal food ; 3d, a supply of lime, pebbles and dust ; 4th, 
have air and water, and 5th, the proper rearing of the young. 

LIME, pebbles and sand or dust are as necessary as corn for 
fowls. Lime is necessary for the formation of the shell, Fowls 
that are confined often lay soft eggs, because they cannot get what 
they want. Slack lime or old mortar is good. The latter acts as 
a natural aid to the triturating powers of the stomach. Fowls are 
subject to parasites, and try to get rid of them by bathing in the 
sand or dust, and hence the importance of their having a supply 
of it in a dry state. 

MOULTING SEASON. Which begins with September or the first fall 
month. During this time they require more than common attention. 
They should be kept dry, warm and well fed. Six weeks will see 
the fowl through his trouble, if he be hardy and strong. The hen 
seldom lays during the moult. Their mate seems to feel that he is 
of no consideration. 

BREEDING AND COOPING CHICKENS. When all the chicks are 
hatched out they should be placed with their mother under a coop 
in a warm, dry place. If two broods are turned out at the same 
time, care must be taken that they be kept separate, for they get 
mixed or go into the wrong coop. In which case they will be treated 
badly if not killed by the hens into whose dwelling they have unwit- 
tingly gone. They should be kept under cover at nightfall and the 
chicks turned loose when the sun becomes warm. After being gradu- 
ally weaned from soaked bread and chopped egg, and then grits or 
boiled barley or samp be given ; in 8 or i o days their stomach will 
be strong enough to receive bruised barley, wheat or oats, and at the 
expiration of 20 days, if the chicks be strong and healthy, they will 
be able to take care of themselves. It is but to have a care over 
them some days longer and see that the older fowls do not drive 
them away from their brood. The most prominent and fatal cause 
of disease is to suffer the chicks to run about the wet ground and on 
the damp grass. A shallow plate of water should be placed in the 
coop for the chicks to be supplied with water, tor in a deep vessel 
they might get wet, drenched or drowned. 

THE BEST WAY TO FATTEN FOWLS is to let them have the run of 
the farm yard, living off the offal from the stable and live on dairy 
scraps, plenty of fresh air and exercise. Some who produce the fat- 
test and largest fowls give them a gruel made of pot liquor and 
bruised oats, to which are added sugar, milk and hog's grease, 



WATER. 513 

WATER. 

GENERAL HISTORY tells us that all nations in the remotest ages 
possessed great veneration for water. The waters of the Nile were 
a special object of adoration among the Egyptians ; they offered 
prayers and made prayers to this fertilizing and life-giving stream; 
the Scythians worshipped the Danube ; the Persians deemed it as 
sacred for them to wash their hands in the vitalizing fluid; the 
Greeks and Romans erected altars and temples to their fountains 
and streams, which were remarkable for their beauty, their delicacy, 
and architectural embellishments. They appointed officers to keep 
watch and ward over the waters of their Nile. The purity of the 
waters was to them an object of special care. The duty of these 
officers was to clean out these fountains or reservoirs, and to keep 
them in order, that the water might be perfectly pure and trans- 
parent. Officers of this nature were appointed over all the Grecian 
cities. But the Romans surpassed other cities in the splendor of 
their aqueducts, which their extraordinary remains show. More 
than half a million hogsheads of water were conveyed daily into 
Rome by more than 10,000 small pipes not 1-3 of an inch in diam- 
etor. The water was received in large basins, above which were 
monuments of architectural splendor, and these basins supplied 
other subterranean conduits connected with various quarters of the 
city, and there were small reservoirs, which received water for cer- 
tain streets for their exclusive use, and through their own taps. 
There were also large pipes to conduct the water off from the city, 
which which was not drinkable. The basins that received this 
were in extensive enclosures, and from which the cattle were watered. 
This also furnished the needful supply of water in case of fire, and 
here also the people washed their linen. 

To PURIFY WATER. Throw into a pail of water one or two pow- 
dered bitter almonds. They do not harden the water like alum. 

DRINKING WATER. Persons who drink little water will be 
stronger and bear fatigue much better. Use of water to excess is 
of no benefit to the health. It effects the skin, the kidneys, the 
bowels and lungs. 

To CLEAR WATER IN FIVE MINUTES. (Dr. Hall.) Put into a 
pail of water as much alum, in powder, as will rest on a dime. 

To CLARIFY MUDDY WATER FOR WASHING. A lump of alum as 
large as a hen's egg, dissolved in a tub of muddy water, will clear it 
nicely for washing purposes. It also renders the clothes less liable 
to take fire ; or, a handful of flour or meal thrown into the tub of 
muddy water awhile before using it, say the night previous. In the 
morning it will be found beautifully clear. 



514 WATER. 

To MAKE A CISTERN. A good one can be made in solid clay 
soil, if not in an exposed situation, by cementing against the sides 
of the ground ; where the ground freezes we would not recommend 
such a practice, but lay a wall of cobble stones in a mortar of ce- 
ment, and face the wall with a thick coat of clear mortar. Great 
care must be exercised to get good cement and mix it with coarse 
sand ; fine sand will not do at all ; three parts cement, one part 
sand, are the usual proportions, to be used as soon as mixed. Every 
part of the wall must be laid below the reach of the frost. This can 
be done, and an iron or wooden pipe or throat led to the surface, 
through which the pump can pass. A cheap and excellent cistern 
can be constructed of wood, in the form of a large cask or tank, 
made of pine or cedar plank. When made into the ground and 
kept constantly wet, it will last for years. A better way is to place 
the tank or cask in the corner of the cellar, with a faucet in the bot- 
tom, from which the water is easily drawn out, when it is desired to 
be cleaned out, and when water is required in the cellar. An open 
cistern in aicellar will never freeze. 

INTERNAL USE OF SEA WATER. Dr. Lyle, a celebrated Frerfch 
physician, says that besides its acting as a useful purgative, sea 
water acts as an alterative in all such cases as are benefited by 
saline mineral. The continual use increases the appetite, facilitates 
digestion, quickens nutrition, changes and augments the proportion 
of red corpuscles in the blood. Accordingly he recommends it; ist, 
during convalescence from acute diseases ; 2d, in the apyretic forms 
of dyspepsia; 3d, in neurasis (nerve), associated with impoverish- 
ment of the blood ; 4th, in scrofulous and tuberculous diathesis ; 
5th, in diabetes. Sea water may be agreeably administered in 
bread, in the form of a syrup, or in that of an elixir. Bread made 
with sea water can only be procured at the seaside. It is very pal- 
atable, and contains nearly 5 grammes of the mineral constituents 
of the water in each pound. The syrup is prepared by mixing 250 
grammes of sea water with a sufficiency of sugar and distilled water 
to make 500 grammes. Each teaspoonful of the syrtip contains 
about 25 centigrammes (2 3-4 grains) of the saline residue of sea 
water. From 2 to 5 tablespoontuls may be taken daily. The 
formula for the elixir is : sea water, 200 grammes, sugar and dis- 
tilled water, up to 500 grammes, The dose at first, a tablespoonful 
3 times a day. 

To MAKE SEA WATER SOFT FOR WASHING PURPOSES. (Dr. 
Mitchel.) Drop into the sea water a solution of soda or potash; 
this makes it suitable for washing. Its milkiness does not injure it. 

PLINY says that fried barley restores putrified water. 

A FILTER OF POROUS BRICK. Some have one side of the cistern of 
porous brick, while the water enters upon one side and percolates 



WATER. 515 

through the porous brick into the other side, a room, whence it is 
drawn out by means of a pump. This dividing brick wall should 
be so tight that the water should only percolate through the porous 
partition. 

CISTERNS. Should be covered above, as well as upon the sides 
with water lime cement. The grand disideratum being to make them 
entirely impervious to the entrance of worms, vermins or insects 
of any kind. Otherwise they become a fertile source of disease, 
rather than health. 

HOT WATER IN GLASSES To prevent their cracking when filled 
set them previously on a cloth wet with hot water. 

To MAKE AN ICE VAULT. Dig a pit 8 or 10 feet square and as 
deep. Lay a double wall with brick; fill between with pulverized 
charcoal; cover the bottom also double with the same, of tan bark. 
If the pit is filled with ice, or nearly so, cover three inches with 
tan bark; but if only a small quantity is in it; wrap well in a blan- 
ket and over the opening in the pit lay a double bag of charcoal. 
Whitewash cellars often. 

* FILTER FOR CISTERN WATER. Perforate the bottom of a wooden 
box with a number of small holes ; place inside a piece of flannel, 
cover with coarsely powdered charcoal, over this coarse river sand, 
and on this small pieces of sandstone. 

To PREVENT WATER FROM FREEZING IN PIPES IN WINTER TIME. 
By tying up the ball cock during the frost the freezing of the 
pipes will often be prevented ; in fact, it will always be prevented 
when the main pipe is higher than the reservoir, and the pipe is laid 
in a regular inclination from one to the other, for then no water can 
remain in the pipe ; or if the main is lower than the cistern, aTid 
the pipe regularly inclines, upon the supply's ceasing the pipe will 
immediately exhaust itself into the main; when water is in the pipes 
if each cock is left dripping, the circulation oT water will frequently 
prevent the pipes from being frozen. 

WATER, IMPURITY OF. Set a pitcher of ice water in an occupied 
room ; in a few hours it will absorb nearly all the gases thrown off 
by perspiration and ompositions in the room, the air of which will 
become purer, but the water filthy. This is obvious from the fact 
that the water has the faculty of condensing and thereby absorbing 
nearly all the gases. NOTE. The authoress invariably sets a large 
pitcher of pure water in her dormitory every night, from knowledge 
of this fact. 

WATER KEPT COOL IN CALIFORNIA. Fill a stone jar, the taller 
the better, with water at night, cover the top with a piece of thin 
muslin ; in the morning, before the sun rises, set the jar in a cool, 
dry and dark place. It will be as cool as spring water, and delight- 
ful for drinking purposes. 



516 OLD STYLE OF COOKING. 



OLD, BUT VALUABLE STYLE OF COOKING. 

The following recipes are taken from an old cook book brought 
by the oldest English settlers in New York more than 200 years ago. 
The book has not more than 50 leaves remaining (obtained through 
the favor of Mrs. Craig, a very old lady and cultivated, who treas- 
ures it as an heir-loom. But it shows that nice dishes could be made 
in former times. 

A RAGOUT FOR MADE DISHES. Take red wine, gravy, sweet 
herbs and spice, in which lamb kidneys are cut up, cockscombs 
boiled, blanched and sliced, with sliced sweet breads, oysters, mush- 
room truffles and morsels; thicken these with browned butter. This 
is convenient to enrich a ragout of any sort. Should be kept close. 

A RAGOUT OF EGGS. Boil 6 eggs hard, then take large mush- 
rooms, peel and scrape them clean, put them into a sauce pan with 
a little salt, cover them, and let them boil ; put to them a gill of red 
wine, a good piece of butter rolled in flour, seasoned with mace and 
nutmeg ; let it boil until of a good thickness ; cut the white of yoijf 
eggs round, so that you do not break the yolks; lay some toasted sip- 
pets of bread in your dish with the yolks of eggs, then pour over your 
ragout ; garnish your dish with the whites, lay the flat side upper- 
most ; a Seville orange between. 

PASTRY FOR TARTS. 3 pounds of flour, 21-2 ozs. of butter, 1-2 
pound of fine sugar beaten. Rub all your butter in the flour, and 
make it a paste with cold sweet milk and 2 spoonfuls of brandy. 

PUFF PASTE. -i quart of flour, i 1-2 Ibs of butter; rub 1-3 part 
of the butter in the flour; make paste with cold water, then roll out 
your paste and put your butter upon it in bits and flour it ; then fold 
it up and roll it again ; after this put in more butter, sprinkle flour 
over, and fold up again; then put the rest of the butter in, flour it, 
fold it, and roll it twice before you use it. 

ROYAL PASTE FOR PATTY PANS. Work 1-2 Ib. of butter in i Ib. 
of flour ; 2 ozs. of sugar and 4 eggs. 

PASTE FOR CUSTARD. Make a stiff paste with boiling water and 
flour, stir well together until smooth, then roll out and sprinkle with 
a little cold water to prevent it from cracking ; parboil. 

To PREPARE HARE FOR PIE. Cut it in pieces, break the bones, 
and lay them in the pie ; lay on dumplings, sliced lemon, butter, 
pepper, salt and the yolks of hard boiled eggs; pour in the gravy in 
which the hare was cooked, put on the top crust, make hole with 
the finger in the top, or stick it well with a fork. 

N. B. Chicken and other fowls may be used in this way. 

LAMB PIE. Season the steaks and lay them in the pie with sliced 



OLD STYLE OF COOKING. 517 

lamb's kidneys and sweet breads, savory balls and oysters ; lay on 
butter, pepper, salt and close the pie with a top crust and bake. 

MUTTON PIE. Parboil the steaks, fill the pie, lay on butter and 
close it ; after putting some of the water in which the mutton steaks 
were boiled ; when baked, mix up a handful of chopped capers, 
cucumbers and oysters with the remainder of the stock water, 
and stew a little until done'; then add a chopped anchovy, and

pippins, a handful of spinach, a hard lettuce, thyme and parsley ; 
mix with a penny loaf .grated and the yolks of 2 or 3 eggs, white 
wine and flower water; 1-2 pound of currants and any preserves. 
When used, mix up with cream, butter or milk. Very convenient 
for the pantry when suddenly wanted to make up pies. 

A CHICKEN PIE. Take 6 small chickens, roll a piece of butter 
in sweet herbs, season and lay them in and cover with the marrow 
qf 2 bones rolled up in the batter of 2 eggs, a dozen of yolks of 
eggs boiled hard, and 2 dozen of savory balls. When served, pour 
in a quart of good hot gravy. 

SWEET CHICKEN PIE. Break the bones of 4 chickens, then cut 
them into small pieces ; season them highly with mace, cinnamon

serves, citron, lemon and orange roots ; 8 ounces marrow, 4 slices 
lemon without the peel, currants, 50 balls of forced meat, made as 
for venison pie. Put in butter at the bottom of the pie, then all 
the ingredients, then a pound of butter, fresh and sweet, on the top, 
then put the crust on and bake it; then in a pint of white wine 
mix a little brandy, the juice of 2 oranges, spices, sugar to taste, 
and cream, salt and pepper to form a sauce to eat with it. 

FORCEMEAT BALLS FOR VENISON PIE. Boil and chop fine the kid- 
neys of venison, then add their weight of beef suet, 8 firm apples, 
1-2 Ib. of currants, a little salt, some mace, cloves, nutmeg and a

ICING FOR TARTS 200 YEARS AGO. Beat and sift 1-4 Ib. of loaf 
sugar into a mortar with the white of an egg beaten to a froth ; add 
2 spoonfuls of rose water and beat till so thick that it will just run ; 
always stir one way ; then lay this on the tart with a brush or feath- 
er dipped in the icing. Set it back in the oven to harden ; not too 
long, or it will dissolve them.

any rich sauce you like. 

To PRESERVE BACON FROM RUST. After the bacon has been salt- 
ed about 15 days, put it into a box the size of the pieces of bacon, 
covering the bottom of the box with hay, wrap each piece of bacon 
in hay and between each put a layer of hay. This will keep it sweet 
for a year. Try it.

pare them, lay them in a pan with some brown sugar, cloves and 
cinnamon. When the pan is full, take some sweet rich perry, the 
newer the better, fill the pan with it and place them together in a 
slow oven ; if a week the bettter. Serve them when you want them 
with a little of the liquor.

cream with some laurel leaves, put on it some fine white sugar and 
some rose water, take five yolks of eggs well beaten, strain all to- 
gether, put on the fire, boil it till thick, but keep stirring it one way 
all the time ; when it is* done, and almost cold, add some beaten 
blanched almonds, with two spoonfuls of brandy ; when you have 
filled your rolls with custard, lay over them some raspberry jam ; 
beat the white of an egg and pulverized sugar to a froth, and ice 
them over with it, and serve in a dish.

a piece at the top and rub into it a mixture of butter and sugar, or 
serve them hot as a sauce for it. 

TURNIP RAGOUT. Boil your turnips, then stew them in gravy 
which thicken with a little pepper, butter and flour. Serve all to- 
gether. 



GAME OF CROQUET. 521 



GAME OF CROQUET. 

CROQUET. This outdoor pastime is of comparatively modern crea- 
tion, and is every day becoming more in vogue. It may be played 
by persons of all ages and of either sex; but it is especially adapted 
to ladies and young persons, as it demands but trifling personal execu- 
tion, while it affords delightful and health-giving sport. The grounds 
upon which croquet is played, is preferably a grass plot of an oblong 
form; but an ordinary lawn or expanse of even both will answer the 
purpose, so long as it is of sufficient extent for the operations of 
the game. The implements for playing croquet, are the balls, the 
mallets, the striking and turning pegs, the croquet clips or mark- 
ers, the hoops or arches. 

Arrangement of the hoops. As much of the interest of this 
game depends upon the arrangement of the hoops, it is expected 
that they should be fixed in the ground on definite principles. In 
the first place, the starling peg is driven in at one end of the ground, 
and the turning peg driven in at the other extremity. From each of 
these pegs a space of twelve feet intervenes; here a hoop is fixed; an- 
other space of ten feet intervenes, when a second hop is fixed; a space 
of eight feet then succeeds, and at this point is formed what may be 
termed the base, on each side of which, at a distance of twenty feet 
and succeeding each other at intervals of ten feet, three hoops are 
driven in. By this arrangement, a square is formed, the starting peg 
leading into its centre, and the turning peg leading from it. When 
the ground is small, the distance may be contracted proportionally. 
Other arrangements of the hoops may be made at the discretion 
of the players, but the first-named plan will be found best worthy of 
adoption, as it affords the most excellent apportunities for the dis- 
play of address and skill. 

The game consists in striking the balls from the starting peg, 
through the several hoops, to the peg at the opposite extremity. 
The balls are then driven back again to the starting peg. 

The game may be played by any number of persons not exceeding 
eight. A larger number protracts the intervals between the several 
turns, and thereby renders the game tedious. The most eligible 
number is four. If two only play, each player should take two balls, 
and when as many as eight play, there should be two sides or sets. 

In playing the game, each player takes a mallet, ball, and croquet 
clip of the same color or number, the clip being used to indicate 
the hoop at which, in his turn, he aims. The division into sides, 
choice of balls, mallets, etc., is determined by the players among 
themselves. 



522 GAMB OF CROQUET. 

LAWS OF THE GAME In croquet, as in many other sports when 
first established, there existed differences of opinion on certain 
points of practice. 

i st. On commencing, each player must place his ball within a 
mallet's length of the starting peg in any direction, and his opening 
stroke must be to pass through the first hoop. 

ad. The players on each side are to play alternately, accord- 
ing to the colors on the starting peg, and the order in which they 
play cannot be altered during the game. 

3d. Each player continues to play as long as he plays with suc- 
cess, that is, so long as he drives his ball through the next hoop in 
order or croquets another ball. 

4th. When a player strikes his own ball so as to hit another at 
a distance, he is said to roquet it, and, having thus hit a ball, he 
must then, as it is termed, "take the croquet," which is done as 
follows: He lays his own ball, which he strikes with his mallet; 
this will drive the ball with a momentum and in a direction most 
desired. In doing this the player should press his foot on his own 
ball. 

5th. A player must move the ball he croquets. He is said to 
"take a stroke off," when he places his own ball to touch the cro- 
queted ball, only lightly, so as to leave it, when croqueted, in 
nearly the same position; but in doing this the croqueted ball must 
be preceptibly moved. 

6th. No ball can croquet, or be croqueted until it has passed 
through the first hoop. 7th. Any player missing the first hoop takes 
his ball up, and, when his turn comes again, plays from the starting 
place, as at first. 8th. A player may croquet any number of balls 
consecutively; but he cannot croquet the same ball twice during the 
same turn, without first sending his own ball through the next hoop 
in order, pth. Instead of aiming at his hoop or another ball, a 
player may strike his ball towards any part of the ground he pleases. 
When he has made a complete circuit from the starting peg back 
to the starting peg, he may either retire from the game by pegging, 
or, by not doing, remain in. In this case he is called a "rover," and 
will have the power of croqueting comsecutively all the balls during 
any one of his turns. loth. When a ball croquets another ball, the 
player's ball is "dead," and "in hand," until after the player of it has 
taken the croquet. Hence it follows that if it continues from one 
ball to another, or from a ball through its own hop, or from a ball 
on to either of the pegs, none of these subsequent strokes count any- 
thing. If, however, a player corner off a ball, which in the same 
turn he has croqueted and then runs off it and makes a stroke that 
stroke counts, nth. A player whose ball is roqueted or croqueted 



THE HAIR. 5 2 3 

through its hoop in order, counts the hoop. izth. A player must 
hit his ball fairly not push it. A ball is considered to be tairly hit 
when the sound of the stroke is heard. A ball is "pushed" when the 
force of the mallet is allowed to rest against it, and the ball propell- 
ed without the mallet being drawn back. 1 3th. A player may play 
in attitude, and use his mallet with his hands in any way he P lea ses, 
so that he strike the ball with the force of the mallet. 1 4th. When 
the ball of a player hits the starting peg, after he has been through 
all the hoops, whether by his own play, or by being roqueted 
(subject to the provisions in law loth), or by being croqueted, he is 
out of the game, which goes on without him, his turn being omitted. 
1 5th The clip is placed on the hoop through which the player i 
next going The clips are to be changed by the umpire, and are 
decisive as to the position of a player's ball; but if the umpire 
forget to change a clip, any player may remind him before 
next stroke. Should there be no clip, a player is entitled to asl 
any of the players how he stands in the game. i6th. A player 
stops at the peg, that is, having struck the turning peg in order, 
his turn is at an end, and even though he should roquet off the 
peg, it does not count. When his turn comes round again, he 
plays his ball from the spot it rolled to after pegging, i/th. A b; 
is considered to have passed through its hoop if it cannot I 
touched by the handle of the mallet, laid on the ground from wire 
to wire on the side from which the ball passed. i8th. The ; 
of the umpire is final. His duties are to move the clips; to decide 
when balls are fairly struck; to restore balls to their places whicl

THE HAIR. 

TREATMENT OF THE HAIR. Grease in all its varieties, is no stimu- 
lant though- it aids the growth by allowing the hair to escape from 
its follicles. Whatever is a stimulant to the skin has a similar effect 
upon the hair, the vessels ot the skin itself and of the hair follicles 
being closely connected. Hence it is that whatever blisters the 
skin will, in a less dose, stimulate the hair follicle to secretion, such, 
as canth'arides, turpentine or ammonia. Soap is generally injurious

THE HAIR. 



from its removal of the oily matter of the hair; but in some cases, 
when there is a quantity of old and tough epidermis matted with the 
contents of the srebaceous follicles, and obstructing the growth of 
the hair, nothing else will liberate it from this injurious thraldom. 
Whenever it is likely that plenty of water is to be employed for 
young children ; soap should never be used, but it would be rather 
beneficial than otherwise, if it is not used every day, for it will only 
remove enough of these impeding materials without entirely de- 
stroying the secretion of the oily matter in rendering the hair too 
dry and brittle. With proper cleanliness the hair ought never to be 
touched with soap, egg, or any other solvent oil. Yet, if this daily 
washing is not practiced, and in the long hair of ladies it can scarcely 
be, an occasional washing with the yolk of eggs is beneficial. 
Friction, when not too violent, is very efficacious, and ranks next to 
ablution, and acts in the same way, but when employed through 
the medium of very penetrating stiff brush or or a sharp-toothed 
comb, causes the fine skin to become inflamed, because left bare 
of its covering. The brush ought to be pushed into the hair at 
an angle with the surface of the skin, and not driven into it in a 
perpendicular manner; not more than enough to raise the loose 
particles of epidermis. It should be perfectly understood that the 
cure is in the hand, and not in the brush. Plain water or fric- 
tion are the only means necessary to keep the hair in a healthy 
state, but a neglected scalp may require soap or yolk of eggs. 

THE BEST stimulants to the growth of the hair are turpentine 
and cantharides, or Eau de Cologne, 2 ounces; tincture of can- 
tharides, 2 drachms ; oil of lavender or rosemary, of each, 10 
drops. These applications must be used once or twice a day for 
a considerable time; but if the scalp becomes sore, they must be dis- 
continued for a time, or used at longer intervals. By these means, 
whenever the bulb is not actually diseased; and so long as there is 
any hair left, however fine, it may be made to enlarge by the in- 
creased flow of blood transmitted to the follicles, and in this way 
many apparently helpless cases have recovered. With regard to 
the oily matter required by the hair, it should be of such a nature 
as not to become solid in the open air, but to remain in a liquid 
state. Vegetable oils are so volatile that they rapidly lose their 
fluidity, so that in a short time the hair is in a worse condition than 
before using the oil, because it is no longer moistened, and a fresh 
layer of slickly, pasty matter is formed. If oils are used at all, they 
should be composed of animal fats. Beef's foot oil, seasoned with 
any favorite essential oil (all of which are more or less stimulating), 
is a most valuable addition to the toilet. Olive oil and almond oil, 
even when mixed with hard animal fat, are too drying in their nature

for the hair. But pure lard, prepared at home, is by no means ob- 
jectionable. Mixed i pound of lard and 1-2 oz. canthardies. 
Suet is too hard, but may be mixed with any of the animal oils to 
advantage to form a pomade. 

CUTTING the hair, whether with scissors or razor, appears to ac- 
celerate its growth, but in which way it is difficult to explain, but it 
does improve the length and strength, and should be repeated at 
short intervals, if only to remove the split ends, or rather to avoid 
them. 

DEPILATORIES, intended to remove superfluous hairs by chemical 
means, are sold by unprincipled persons who well know their want 
of power. Nothing but the tweezers have the slightest effect, and 
the man who could succeed by less painful means would soon realize 
a fortune, I give a remedy which I found in a book of recipes pub- 
lished nearly a hundred years ago, which is as simple as it is effec- 
tual in aiding to extract superfluous hairs. 

To TAKE HAIR OUT BY THE ROOTS. Two and one-half ounces of 
resin, i ounce of beeswax ; melt them together and make into 
sticks for use ; warm the end and paste it over the hair, and then 
with the tweezers or fingers remove the foe to beauty. 

HAIR WASHES are used for removing the waxy dust which has ac- 
cumulated on the scalp and in the hair, and eradicating dandruff, 
and should be washed off with soft, warm water after each applica- 
tion, if used more than once. 

ROSEMARY EXTRACT. Carbonate of potash, i ounce; alcohol, 8 
ounces ; oil of rosemary, 2 drachms ; water, i gallon ; colored with 
burnt sugar, and filtered. 

ARNICA HAIR WASH. When the hair is falling off and be- 
coming thin from frequent use of castor, maccassar oils, &c., or 
when premature baldness arises from illness, the arnica hair wash 
will be found of great service in arresting the mischief. It is thus 
prepared: Take elder water, 1-2 pint; sherry wine, 1-2 pint; tinc- 
ture of arnica, 1-2 ounce ; alcoholic ammonia, i drachm ; if this 
last named ingredient is old and has lost its strength, then 2 
drachms instead of i may be employed. The whole of these may 
be mixed in a lotion bottle, and applied to the head every night 
with a sponge. Wash the head with warm water twice a week. 
Soft brushes only must be used during the growth of the young 
hair. 

WASH FOR THE HAIR. One-third each of bay rum, glycerine and 
water. Wash the hair with it, and comb often. 

A WASH TO STIMULATE THE GROWTH OF THE HAIR. ("Ugly 
Girl.") Sulphate of quinine and aromatic tincture, equal parts. 

How TO WASH THE HAIR. Borax and camphor cleanse the 
beautifully, and render it rich and glossy. 



526 THE 

FOR CLEANSING THE SCALP, OR SHAMPOOING. Dissolve one tea- 
spoonful of borax in a tea cup full of hot water. Apply the liquid to 
the scalp and rub hard until a good lather is produced, then rinse 
with cold water until the hair feeis natural ; wipe the hair dry be- 
fore combing. Avoid using ammonia and other dangerous irritants. 
Before bathing in the morning, put one teasponful this water into your 
basin ; it will cure blotches of the face, removing prickly heat and 
freckles caused by summer heat. 

WASH TO CLEANSE THE HAIR OF GROWN-UP PERSONS. One ta- 
blespoonful of liquid ammonia, i pint of water ; pour a small por- 
tion on the hair at a time and rub it in, then wash it in clear, warm 
water and mild soap ; wipe until dry. Bottle it and apply when 
needed. 

POMADES. 

IN preparing pomades it is always best to make the lard directly 
from the green leaf; it is best in winter ; try it in a porcelain or 
preserving kettle over a steady and slow fire, taking care that it does 
not burn ; when melted, add to i pound of lard a pinch of finely 
powdered alum, a good teaspoonful of salt, i gill of water ; bring 
the whole to a boiling point, keep up the heat 5 or 10 minutes, stir- 
ring with a wooden spoon all the time ; if any scum forms, remove 
it, then allow the lard to get cold; at the bottom some impurities, 
with the alum and salt, will be found, which can be removed ; the 
lard must be put back with a small portion of water and one small 
teaspoonful of salt, when the lard is melted ; after stirring it a few 
minutes, it can be set aside to cool; care should be taken to expel 
all the moisture, for if any be left it in the lard it will soon turn ran- 
cid ; no perfume should be added until the lard is nearly cold, oth- 
erwise they are changed by the heat, and others entirely dissipated. 
When poured into bottles, it is best for it to be as cool as it can well 
be ; if hot. a vacuum is formed in the center on account of the con- 
traction which takes place on cooling. The jars or bottles should 
be moderately warm. Add a drop or two on the top of the lard of 
the desired perfume. 

To MAKE POMADE FOR THE HAIR. One-quarter pound of lard, 
1-2 pint of castor oil; scent. Let the lard be unsalted; beat it up 
well, then add the castor oil and mix thoroughly with a knife, adding 
a few drops of any scent that may be preferred. Put the pomatum 
into pots, which keep well covered, to preserve it from turning 
rancid, 

POMADE A LA JONQUILLE. Inodorous lard, i pound; vanilla, 1-2 
pound; musk, 1-2 pound; oil bergamot, i ounce; attar of roses, 10 
drops ; oil neroli, i drachm.

HAIR OILS. 

DIAMOND HAIR OIL AND TONIC. Good for the scalp and nice 
for the hair: Castor oil, 8 ozs.; tincture of blood root, i oz.; can- 
tharides, i oz.; oil of bergamot, i oz.; alcohol, i quart. 

OAKLAND HAIR OIL. Castor oil, 1-2 pint; creamed lard, o 



528 THE HAIR. 

ive, or almond oil, 6 gills ; color, perfume, and mix to suit. This 
oil does not congeal in cold weather ; alkanet is generally used for 
coloring a beautiful red, turmeric for lemon color, and armanetto for 
coloring orange. 

COCOANUT OIL Is good for the hair, provided it be new and 
fresh. 

PALM OIL is also fine for the hair ; its odor is pleasant, resem- 
bling violets, and is a fine addition to pomades ; turmeric will give 
it a lemon color. 

ITALIAN HAIR OIL. Mix castor oil, i pint, with half pint Ja- 
maica rum, and perfume with any essential oil to fancy. 

ANTIQUE HUB OIL. Oils of sweet almonds and olive, each 1-2 
pint ; the oils should be the best ; scent with any sort of perfume ; 
use any coloring ; put into a bottle and cork tightly. 

MACASSAR OIL. One pint of olive oil, 3 ozs. alcohol, 1-4 oz. of 
rose oil ; free from dust chipped alkanet root (which can be had 
from a druggist for a few cents), 1-2 an ounce ; divide it into 3 or 4 
muslin or bobbinet bags, and let them lie in the oil until a pretty 
bright red or crimson is developed, then change them to other oil, 
as the bags can be used again for the same purpose, put into the 
bottom of each phial a small quantity of any perfume that you may 
fancy, such as the oil of bergamot, orange flowers, rose, jessamine, 
&c., mixed with a little tincture of musk ; do not press the chipped 
alkanet root, nor shake the bottle when you use the oil, but pour a 
small portion into a flat vessel or saucer, and with your finger rub it 
through the roots of the hair. 

BEARS' GREASE. Not being a commercial article, it requires 
a quantity of perfume to counterbalance the unpleasant odor, but 
the genuine oil can be counterfeited, and is just as good in quality, 
if not better, for the hair. Good, fresh and sweet lard, i pound ; 
beef suet, 4 ounces ; melt the suet, then, according to the heat of 
the weather, add from 4 to 8 ounces of castor oil or olive oil, then 
add the lard ; triturate till nearly cold, then vary to suit the fancy, 
or in the following proportions: oil of bergamot, i ounce; oil of 
lavender, 1-2 an ounce; oil of cloves, 10 drops; pour into bottle or 
jar ; cork tightly. 

COLORING THE HAIR. A French Recipe (The ugly girl papers. ) 
Melt together in a bowl set in boiling water, 4 ozs. of white wax in 
4 ozs of olive oil, stirring in when melted and mixed, 2 ozs. of burnt 
cork in powder. This will not take the dull, bluish tinge of metallic 
dyes, but give a lustrous blackness to the hair, like life. To apply 
it, put on old gloves, cover the shoulders carefully to protect the 
dress, and spread the color preparation like pomade on the head, 
working it well through the hair. It changes the color at once, as a 
black dressing rather than a dye. 



THE HAIR. 529 

FOR THE HAIR. For dark hair use 2 ozs. of strong green sage 
steeped in a quart of water to wash the hair with. For light or blond 
hair, use dried sage tea. Boil both till reduced to a pint and then 
apply it to the hair. Mrs. Dr. French. 

To TURN THE HAIR A GOLD COLOR GRADUALLY. Wash it several 
times a day with champagne wine. 

To COLOR GRAY HAIR A GOLD COLOR. A small portion of the 
nitrate of silver, dissolved in sweet oul. 

To PREVENT ONE'S BONNET FROM BEING INJURED BY THE HAIR. 
Past a piece of oiled silk in the part where the crown of your bon- 
net meets the brim, spreading it some distance up the crown and 
some distance down into the hair between the outside and lining. 
Or an oiled bonnet or cap may do. 

SCALD HEADS 

CURE FOR SCALD HEAD. This disease commences with the symp- 
toms of the common ring worm in its earliest stages, only the rings 
are not so red as the former; the skin in the center does not appear 
very different from the surrounding healthy parts, but when examin- 
ed carefully it is found full of minute pustules which are highly con- 
tageous and full of a yellow matter, capable of communicating the 
disease even to adults. Though there is no fever, the health is not 
perfect, which may be either the cause or the effect of the disease. 
If carefully noticed previous to the outbreak, the ordinary scurf be- 
comes thicker and browner than usual ; then the eruption spreads 
rapidly, and if not arested extends over the face, neck and shoul- 
ders, causing the hair to fall from the head, eyebrows and lashes, and 
the person to appear almost a leper ; sometimes the skin appears 
covered with white scabs, and to fall off like bran, and unless care- 
fully washed becomes highly offensive. The treatment is almost 
entirely local and the remedies will be useless, if the reduction of 
the general health is not supported by good living and tonics. The 
first thing to be done is to cut off the hair with scissors or shave the 
diseased spot as closely as possible with a razor, then make a lather 
as strong as possible with castile soap and rub it on the sores ; let it 
remain a moment to soften the scabs, then wash them clean in warm 
water and wipe them dry. The parts being cleansed, the applica- 
tions can act on them ; then place on them a large iflaxseed meal 
poultice. After removing this valuable poultice wash the place 
again with mild soap and water, and wipe dry ; after this, make a 
plaster of ointment composed of i drachm of iodide of mercury to i 
oz. of lard; let it remain a day and night, then cleanse the scalp 
with yellow or domestic soap and apply the ointment again. Re- 
peat this every day, but if the mercury causes too much irritation, on 



530 THE HAIR. 

alternate days use the iodide of sulphur, made half as strong as the 
iodide of mercury, but if the irritation still continues, apply another 
linseed poultice. Generally this application acts in a wonderfu 
manner after a day or two, and reduces the disease to a mere scurf. 
But this must not by any means be considered a cure, until the skin 
is sound and the hair comes out again, which it does in the course 
of time. The above remedies destroy the vegetable fungus in which 
the disease essentially consists. If but little scurf remain, instead 
of the ointment, use a wash composed of 10 to 20 grains of chloride 
of zinc, 2 oz. glycerine ; rose water, 6 oz ; mix. Or, sometimes use 
an ointment of creosote, composed of 1-2 fluid drachm of creosote 
with i oz. of lard, melted till thoroughly incorporated. I have met 
with the following directions, which I, with the above, consider ex- 
tremely valuable, for so loathsome a disease known as tetter or 
scald head: Take of carbonate of soda i drachm which dissolve in 
1-2 pint of vinegar. Wash the head every morning with soft soap, 
and apply the lotion night and morning. One teaspoonful of sul- 
phur and treacle should also be given occasionally night and morn- 
ing. The hair should be cut close, and around the spot it should be 
shaved off and the part bathed night and morning with a lotion 
made by dissolving i drachm of sulplur in 6 ozs. of water. A small 
piece of either of the subjoined ointments, rubbed into the part 
when the lotion has dried in. No. i. Take of citron ointment i 
drachm.; sulphur and tar ointments, of each 1-2 oz.; mix thoroughly 
and apply twice a day. No. 2. Take of simple cerate, i oz.; creo- 
sote i dram.; calomel, 30 grains ; mix and use in the same manner 
as the first. Concurrent with these external remedies, the child 
should take an alterative powder every morning ; or, if they act too 
much on the bowels, only every second day. An important fact 
must be remembered by mother or nurse, never to use the same 
comb or wipe on the same towel employed for the child with a dis- 
eased scalp for the healthy children, or let the little afflicted one 
sleep with those that are free from the disease ; and, for fear of any 
contact with hands, head or otherwise, to keep the child's head en- 
veloped in a tight cap until the eruption is completely cured. 

N. E. I have known several families to take scald head imme- 
diately from one individual. A little boy took it from a young 
friend whom he loved dearly ; others from him, &c., till it was circu- 
lated. None knew how infectious or contagious it was, or that it 
was so at all, and after many years of regrets, with visiting of water- 
ing places and heavy medical bills, they were cured by using the old 
fashioned but repulsive remedy of anointing the places with equal 
portions of flowers of sulphur and pure lard, perfumed with oil of 
roses. The hair being shaven closely, the scalp repeatedly washed

and Kept clean, wearing a cap, keeping free from exposure to draught 
and cold. Taking daily, as an apperient, cream of tartar. 

To REMOVE scurf from the head, take 8 ozs. of castor oil, 6 ozs. of 
olive oil, 1-2 oz. of tincture of cantharides ; mix it well and add 2 
drams of essence of bergamot to render it agreeable. Or mix equal 
quantities of rum and oil, and use it like oil alone. Or take equal 
portions of castor oil, sweet oil and rum. 

DEPILATORIES. 

DEPILATORIES FOR REMOVING SUPERFLUOUS HAIR. All articles 
of this kind should be used with much care, as the skin sometimes 
comes off with the hair, causing a very unpleasant sore. But many 
persons will use them, notwithstanding the danger. Mix a sufficient of 
the powder with warm water to form a paste; place enough on the 
hair to cover it, and allow it to remain a few minutes, or until its 
action on the skin be sensibly felt; then remove it with a penknife or 
a paper knife, like removing the beard with lather; apply a little cold 
cream or oil after washing the place well with clear water. 

H MR SUPERFLOUS, TO REMOVE. Make a plaster of shoemaker's 
wax, spread it over a very fine and strong cloth or an old kid glove, 
warm it just enough to make it stick to the skin, then pull off sud- 
denly. It will not smart much, then wash the spot or arms in warm 
soapsuds; when partially dry, rub on some wood ashes and wash off 
at once in clear water, then grease the skin. This application, re- 
peated a few times as the hair grows out, will entirely destroy the 
roots. 

BANDOLINES. 

BANDOLINE OR FIRE TAN FOR THE HAIR. Take good Irish moss 
one lb.; cover it with water, and allow it to stand for 30 minutes 
or more, then pour off the water and add about a quart more of 
fresh water; put it on the stove and boil till dissolved; then strain 
it through a cloth without squeezing it; if, on cooling a little, it is too 
solid, add sufficient water to make it the consistency of thick syrup. 
It can be perfumed with attar of roses or anything desired; a few 
drops is sufficient to answer the purpose. If required to keep for 
some time, dissolve five grains corrosive sublimate and ten grains of 
muriate of ammonia in a little water and add to it. If required of a 
pink color, pass a little alcohol through cudbear to tinge it, or bloom 
of roses can be used when the sublimate is omitted. Quince seeds 
are superior to Irish moss, if they can be obtained, and are prepared 
in a similar way. Put in bottles or jars and keep closely. 

BANDOLINE FOR THE HAIR. English. Boil a tablespoonful of 
linseed in a plot of water for five minutes. Strain and bottle for use. 



532 THE HAIR. 

HAIR TONICS AND INVIGORATORS. 

HAIR RESTORATIVE. Fine salt dissolved in water, apply daily. 

To PROMOTE THE GROWTH OF HAIR. Equal quantities of olive 
oil and spirits of rosemary, a few drops of oil of nutmeg. Mix the 
ingredients together; rub the roots of the hair every night, with a 
little of this liniment, and the growth will soon sensibly increase, 

To INCREASE THE GROWTH OF THE HAIR. Beat heartshorn very 
fine and mix with sweet oil; put upon the head of persons who 
have lost their hair, will cause it to grow again as at first. 

ROSEMARY LEAVES A HAIR TONIC. Steep them in rectified spirits; 
good to promote the growth of the hair on account of its essential 
oil. 

HAIR TONIC i dram flour sulphur, i dram sugar of lead, i dram 
cantharides, 2 oz. spirits ammonia, i oz. glycerine, 2 ozs. rose water; 
add one pint of soft water, and shake it well before using it. Used 
for many years. 

CURE FOR BALDNESS. 

CAPILLARY OIL FOR BALDNESS. It is good for stimulating the 
growth of the hair after a spell of sickness and for preventing it 
from falling off. As far as experience goes, it remains unequalled, 
by any other hair tonic. 8 grains corrosive sublimate, 10 grains 
cantharides; 12 ounces alcohol; mix and allow the compound to 
stand for 3 days, then filter; add castor oil 4 ounces, 1-2 ounce oilot 
rosemary flowers. Apply once every day, and rub well into the 
skin. A stiff brush is better, as it slightly irritates the scalp. A 
daily application for seven or eight days, will effectually stop the 
hair from coming out, and if cutaneous disease exist, the mixture 
will cure it. 

BALDNESS. Mix pearlash, 1-2 oz., onion juice i gill, i pint of 
water. Cork in a bottle. Rub the scalp hard with a rough linen 
towel dipped in the mixture daily. 

OIL FOR INCIPIENT BALDNESS. A mixture of equal parts of tinct- 
ure of cantharides and olive or almond oil, simply agitated together 
before use. A more effective and cleanly liquid may be made by 
substituting more of spirits of rum for the oil, and adding i or 1-2 
drams (Price's) glycerine to each ounce of the mixture. Distilled 
or rosemary water is often substituted for proof spirits. A still more 
active preparation is made of the catharides and glycerine only. 

TO CURL THE HAIR. 

To CURL HAIR. Take 2 oz. borax, i dram of powdered gum 



THE HAIR. 533 

Senegal, i quart hot water (not boiling), mix, and as soon as the in- 
gredients are dissolved, add 2 oz. of spirits of wine, strongly im- 
pregnated with camphor; on retiring to rest, wet the hair with the 
above mixture and roll it in paper as usual; leave them till morning 
then untwist and form into ringlets. 

To MAKE HAIR CURL EASILY. This may be done by rubbing it 
with a beaten yolk of an egg, washed off with clear water, afterwards. 
_Note It is always well to go through this process when you 
change to curls after having worn the hair plain. 

To MAKE HAIR CURL. After wetting the hair to be curled, let the 
ends be as even as possible, then wrap it around a perfectly smooth 
round stick of wood, or a metalic tube of proper size; tie it properly 
and put it so as to suspend it in water, that it may not touch the 
bottom, of the vessel and boil from 3 to 10 hours, remove it from the 
boiler, wrap it carefully in a newspaper, or in dough and bake it in a 
moderate oven for one hour. Thus heated, it will remain perma- 
nantly curled. 

BEER FOR CURLING THE HAIR. Beer may be used to make the 
hair curl finely and hold it in any required position, it is applied by 
simply moistening the fingers, and passing the hair through them. 

To Cof,OR THE HAIR. Wash it daily with cold potato water. 

GOLDEN POWDER FOR THE HAIR. Make a strong solution of 
alum and hot water, then add powdered termuric enough to make a 
deep orange color, then set it to crystalize, then crush it to a coarse 
powder. To make the hair golden for an evening entertainment. 
Dampen the hair with a weak mixture of gum arabic water, then 
dust over the above gold powder. It does not shake off. 

HAIR DYES WITHOUT PREPARATION. 

Nitrate of silver, i ounce ; 8 ounces distilled water ; sufficient of 
liquid ammonia to redissolve the precipitate first formed. This ap- 
plied to the hair soon turns it to a dark shade, particularly if it is ex- 
posed to the warmth of the sun's rays; much care must be used in 
applying it. Stains on the skin or on linen can be removed by using 
a weak solution of cyanide of potassium. Clear days are the best 

to apply it. 

HAIR DYE No. i. Label a bottle No. i ; place in it i ounce of 
soft or clear warm water after settling ; put into the water i drachm 
of sulphide or sulphuret of potassium. 

HAIR DYE No. 2. Label another bottle No. 2 ; pour into it i 
ounce of soft or clear rain water ; and into the water thus bottled i 
drachm of crystal ized nitrate of silver. Apply No. i, and directly 
after it No. 2 for a few minutes, alternately, using different brushes 
for each number ; use on clear days ; as soon as dry wash out well 



534 GLYCERINE. 

with soap. Be careful not to get it on the skin or clothes, as it 
makes the face sore, as well as colors it. 

LIQUID TO COLOR the hair black without staining the skin. One 
part bay rum, 3 parts of olive oil, and i part of good brandy by 
measure ; wash the hair with it every morning and it will make the 
hair beautifully black without injuring it ; use articles of the best 
quality ; mix in a bottle ; shake well before applying. 

A HARMLESS DYE FOR COLORING THE HAIR. (Dr. G.) Take a 
piece of unslacked lime (a good article) and reduce it to powder by 
pouring water on it, then mix it with a portion of litharge, one- 
fourth to one-third as much litharge as lime; reduce to a fine pow- 
der and pass through a seive. 

A VALUABLE AND NATURAL DYE FOR FHE HAIR. (Contributed

Encyclopaedia.")- --Collect the juice of the mesquite tree by making 
an incision in it; Jhen wash the hair perfectly clean and wipe it dry, 
then wet it several times with the forementioned juice, and it will not 
only make the hair soft and kill the vermin, but will make the hair 
rich and glossy^and also the beard. Note. This juice is used by 
the Navajo Indians for dying their hair jet black, and exerts no in- 
jurious effects. 

GRECIAN HAIR DYE. (Harmless.) Is made from green walnut 
hulls (Juglau regia) by extracting with water and evaporating until 
the regianic acid is precipitated as a black powder. 

TINCTURE FOR GRAY HAIR. To 4 ounces of the finely beaten 
root of the wild indigo plant, i pint of alcohol, and i pint of rain 
water or soft water ; let it steep for six or seven days in a closely 
covered vessel or bottle, then simply wet the scalp with It twice a 
day night or morning. 

GLYCERINE. 

GLYCERINE is the best application known for burns. It is sooth- 
ing as well as healing ; it is invaluable in diphtheria ; apply to the 
throat with a soft brush. It is good in croup ; for dry sores ; for 
painful sores ; for blistered skin ; head scab, and diarrhcea in chil- 
dren, used both internally and externally; for chronic pneumonia, 
given in a teaspoonful dose 3 times a day. It is excellent to mix 
poultices with to keep them moist, and to make them more healing. 
and prevent their sticking. It should be in every family. 

GLYCERINE. This valuable substance was for ages considered of 
no importance, being derived from the residuum left after the mak- 
ing of stearine candles and soap. Its medical properties are of the 
most striking character, and its value beyond computation, not only 
in pharmacy, but in innumerable things; its antisceptic properties 



CORNS, BUNIONS AND WARTS. 53 J 

are wonderful. It can preserve animal substances from decay ; 
leather is rendered soft and pliable, and preserved by it. If satu- 
rated with it, wooden vessels neither shrink nor dry up ; its power 
in healing sores, removing pains, such as scratches, of burns, is 
marvellous. It is used for extracting the odor of flowers, and is of 
great use in the processes of dying, wine-keeping, brewing, and 
liquor making. 

GLYCERINE LOTION. Mix i oz. of glycerine with i pint of water. 
It allays itching and removes dryness, &c.,in various skin diseases, 
with the addition of 2 or 3 drachms of borax, it removes chaps 
from the lips, hands, and nipples. 

CORNS, BUNIONS AND WARTS. 

CORNS. Scrape chalk and bind it upon the corn, or at night bind 
a piece of lemon upon it. Gylcerine is good for corns. 

CORNS. No. 2. Take a small piece of flannel that has not been 
washed, wrap or sew round the corn and toe. One thickness will 
be sufficient. Wet the flannel where the corn is, night^nd morning, 
with fine sweet oil. Remove the flannel weekly, and at the same 
time pare the corn, which will soon disappear. 

To CURE CORNS. Before going to bed at night, put a coating of 
gum arabic over the corn. It will soon get well. 

FOR CORNS. Powder some copperas and make a paste with water, 
put it on a cloth and bind it on the corn, when going to bed, for 
several nights; bind so as not stain the bed linen. 

CURE FOR WARTS. French Physician. Steep a small piece of 
raw beef in sugar all night, trim the wart and bind as much as will 
cover it and tie it on. If the excresence is on the forehead, con- 
fine it with sticking plaster cut in strips. 

RELIABLE CURE FOR CORNS. Remove the hard part with a sharp 
knife, then wrap a piece of canton flannel twice around the toe, and 
tie it with a thread near the end, just tight enough to keep the cloth 
on. Then saturate the cloth directly over the corn with pure spirits 
of turpentine. In ten minutes the annoyance will cease. 

MECHANICAL CORN PLASTERS. Any suitable adhesive plaster is 
spread on a thick leather (buckskin), which is cut to a suitable size; 
punch a hole in the centre, vulcanized India rubber, or any soft 
leather, prepared in the same way; the hole must just fit so as to let 
the corn through. . 

WARTS AND CORNS, ro CURE IN A FEW MINUTES. Make a poultic 
of some slacked saleratus, and powdered gum arabic and a 1 
water. Spread it on a small piece of rag. Then with a sharp knife 
trim the corn or wart and put the plaster on and let it remain ten or

look worse. Above all, as you regard health, comfort, and beauty, 
do not lace too tightly. A waist too small for the natural propor- 
tion of the figure is the worst possible deformity, and produces 
many others. No woman who laces tight can have good shoulders, 
a straight spine, good lungs, sweet breath, or is fit to be a wife and 
mother. The most elegant dresses are black or white ; common 
modesty will prevent indecent exposure of the shoulders and bo- 
som. A vulgar girl wears bright and glaring robes, fantastically 
made ; a large flaring, red, yellow, or sky-blue hat, covered with a 
rainbow of ribbons, and all the rings and trinkets she can load upon 
her. Of course, a modest, well-bred lady chooses the reverse of 
this. In any assemblage, the most plainly-dressed woman is sure to 
be the most ladylike and attractive. Neatness is better than rich- 
ness, and plainness is better than display. Single ladies dress less 
in fashionable society than married ones, and all more plainly and 
substantially, for walking or traveling, than other occasions. As 
a general rule, applicable to both sexes, that persons are the best 
dressed when you cannot remember what they had on. Avoid 
everything out qf the way, uncommon, or grotesque. 

To PACK AWAY DRESSES. Carefully fold in very dark-blue paper, 
as highly glazed as possible. This will preserve the color of them, 
but they must be kept in a dry place, or be occasionally unfolded 
and hung for a few hours in a dry room, and the paper be dried, 
too, otherwise they will be sure to be spotted with mold. 

THE BEST DRESSED persons are those that wear the least jewelry. 
Of all things, avoid showy chains, large rings, and flaring gewgaw 
pins and brooches. All these should be left to the uncivilized In- 
dians and South Sea Islanders. 

PHOTOGRAPHS, TO DRESS. In taking photographs, dress in dark- 
brown, dark-green, maroon, and plain blark goods, without gloss, 
will make a dark, rich, drab color ; silks of a drab color consider- 
ably lighter; snuff-brown, dark-leather, dark beaver, dark-drab ; 
scarlet, cherry, orange, crimson, and slate, will take a very rich drab 
color. Violet, blue, purple, pink, and magenta will take very light, 
and should not be worn when sitting for a picture. 

LOTION FOR THE COMPLEXION. Mix together 1-2 oz. powdered 
borax and i oz. of pure glycerine, with i quart of camphor water. 
Wet the face every morning, and when nearly dry, wash it clean 
and wipe it dry. 

FOR THE SKIN. An old English prescription. Slice a cucumber 
in a cup of blue skimmed milk, let it stand an hour, then bathe the 
hands and face in it ; when dry wash it off. It is said that it will 
cause the hair to grow on bald spots. 

To SOFTEN AND REFINE THE SKIN. "Ugly Girl." Rub the milk 



LADIES' TOILET. 539 

on the face which exudes from the stalks and leaves of garden let- 
tuce, at night and in the morning; wash it off with a solution of 
spirits of ammonia, 

To PROTECT THE SKIN FROM THE STRONGEST FROST. Put 3 to 6 
drops of glycerine into water before washing the hands and face, or, 
if only washing the hands, put one drop into the palm of the hand 
after washing off the soap and dirt, rub all over the hands and 
wrists, and then dry thoroughly. This is also good for sunburn. 

FOR CHAPPED SKINS FROM THE COLD AND WIND. Apply cold 
cream or glycerine at night and wash off in the morning with car- 
bolic soap. To avoid rough skins from exposure, before going out 
rub the face, arms and throat well with cold cream or pure almond 

oil. 

A FINE WASH FOR THE SKIN. Put two tablespoonfuls of ammo- 
nia in a basin of water. 

OINTMENT FOR PIMPLES. Thirty-six grains bicarbonate of soda, 
i drachm of glycerine, i oz. of spermaceti 

To PRODUCE A HEALTHY ACTION OF THE SKIN. Dip the toes 
in water every morning and night, and rub the feet till perfectly 
dry. 

RAIN WATER is the best lotion, bloom of youth, and cosmetic for 

the skin. 

To TAKE WRINKLES GOT OF THE FACE, OR PREVENT THEM. 
Cover the head and hold the face over the fumes of powdered 
myrrh heated on an iron plate. 

To REMOVE WRINKLES. Thirty-six grains of turpentine, 3 
drachms of water; mix and apply at night, letting it dry. 

WHEN THE WRINKLES ARE DEEPER. Use 2 1-2 drachms of es- 
sence of turpentine, i drachm gum mastic, 2 ozs. fresh butter; mix 
with the lotion ; wash the face, and let it dry without wiping. 

ERUPTIONS ON THE FACE. Dissolve i oz. of borax in a quart of 
water, and apply with a sponge on going to bed. This will destroy 
the insect working under the cuticle. 

CAMRHORATED ALMOND PASTE. This preparation is used for 
softening the skin and chapped hands, roughness of skin, &c. 

COSMETIC FOR THE COMPLEXION. Mix glycerine with water and a 
small quantity of alcohol; add cologne or other perfume, and you 
have preparation excellent for the complexion. 

THE GREAT SECRET OF ENAMELING THE SKIN. Get from the 
druggist the purest and most refined glycerine and lily or Parisian 
white and rouge ; before going to bed wash in simple hot water as 
can be borne (that of rain water is the best), the parts you design 
to make white, then dry rub with a coarse towel till perfectly free 
from moisture ; then moisten a linen cloth with the pure glycerine, 



540 LADIES' TOILET. 

and rubbing it well on the skin. This can be done as often as you 
like ; very soon the glycerine will remove all that disfigures the looks 
of the skin, leaving it as white and tender as an infant's. If de- 
sired, you may use a little of the purest white lily and rouge 
powder. 

To CLEAR THE COMPEXION. Take finely powdered and softened 
charcoal, a teaspoonful mixed with water or honey three nights in 
succession, then work it out with a mild purgative; it acts like calo- 
mel without its effects. This is important, for the charcoal remains 
in the system with all the poison it has absorbed, so that an aperi- 
ent must not be neglected. "Ugly Girl." This should be repeated 
every three months. 

AN English writer says that there is no greater preservation of 
beauty than washing the face in hot water at night. 

PEARL POWDER. Take of French chalk, in very fine powder, 1-4 
pound; oxyde chloride of bismuth, 1-2 ounce; mix well together; 
then apply by moistening a sufficient quantity with water, or di- 
luted cologne, with a soft rag, and allowing it to dry on ; after 
which it will bear wiping with a towel to remove superfluous 
quantity. 

CHINESE WHITENING, OR MEEN FUN. Carbonate of magnesia, 
2 ozs.; prepared chalk, i oz.; both in fine powder ; mix. 

FRENCH ROUGE. Take French chalk in the quantity desired and 
mix with it carmine, to make it the shade wished. It can be used 
as a powder, or with a little weak mucillage of gum dragon. 

To IMITATE FLESH COLOR. Mix a little white and yellow chalk 
together, then add a little more red than yellow; these form 
an excellent imitation of the complexion. 

CARE OF THE HANDS. To make the hands soft and white, one 
of the best things is to wear large mittens (at night) of cloth filled 
with wet bran or oatmeal, and confined at the wrist closely. A lady 
who had the whitest, softest hands in the country confessed that she 
had a great deal of house work to do, and kept them as white as 
any idler's by wearing bran mittens at night. The pastes and poul- 
tices for the face owe most f their efficacy to their moisture, which 
dissolves the coarse skin, and to their protection from the air, which 
allows the new skin to come tender and delicate. Oatmeal paste 
is as efficacious as anything, though less agreeable than pastes made 
with the white of egg, alum and rose water. The alum astringes 
the flesh and makes it firm, while the egg keeps it sufficiently soft, 
and the rose water perfumes the mixture and makes the curd not so 
hard. 

To MAKE THE HANDS WHITE, Keep a jar of oat or corn meal 
on the washstand, and after you have soaped your hands, put some 



LADIES' TOILET. 54 T 

meal on them, rub it well in, with the soap, rinse it off, and before 
wiping put on a coat of glycerine ; then put on a pair of loose old 
kid gloves, let them remain all night, and in the morning wash off 
the glycerine. There is nothing better. 

To PRODUCE A PURE, CLEAR SKIN. Take a vapor bath or alco- 
hol bath thrice a week, which is done by placing a saucer of alcohol 
under an open chair covered over with a large blanket, then wrap 
the patient loosely in another and seat the person on it, then throw 
the loose ends of the lower blanket over and set fire to the alcohol 
with a match and steam for 15 minutes or use a tepid bath rub 
till perfectly dry, or the body begins to glow ; or instead a tepid bran 
bath, or one of oat meal, and rub till the skin shines. 

To MAKE THE SKIN FRESH AND SOFT. Mix together 3 table- 
spoonfuls of honey and the white of an egg, and a very little thick 
cream or mutton tallow; spread over the face on going to bed. In 
the morning wash off with soap and warm water. 

WRINKLES, TO REMOVE. Make a mixture of tar and almond oil, 
and on going to bed, apply. Place an old covering on the pillows to 
protect them from stains. 

FACE PASTE. Beat or whisk well together the whites of 4 eggs, 
1-2 oz. each of alum and almond oil. Apply. 

To REMOVE FACE MOTHS, LIVER SPOTS, BLOTCHES, ETC., ETC. 
Beat together equal portion of wild tansy, horse radish and new 
milk. Anoint the face at pleasure and let it dry without wiping. 

To REMOVE PIMPLES AND SMALL-POX MARKS. Equal portions of 
mutton tallow and hog's lard with a little cologne to make the mix- 
ture smell nicely. Apply it for days as often as you choose. 

N. B. No one can have a nice complexion if the digestion is 

To WHITEN THE HANDS, A CREAM. A wineglassful each of lem- 
on juice and cologne water ; then scrape fine 2 cakes each of brown 
Windsor and pure white soap to fine powder and mix all to a pulp, 
then pour into moulds ; when hard, use for the toilet. 

FOR CHAPPED HANDS. One oz. glycerine, 1-2 oz. bay-rum, 1-2 
oz. cologne; mix thoroughly and apply. 

To SWEETEN THE BREATH. Get from your druggist a package c 
crushed cubeb berries, smoke them every night before retiring and 
be sure to use a dark clay pipe, as it does not become strong. This 
will sweeten the foulest breath. 

To CLEANSE the teeth and purify the breath, chew orris-root or 

burnt bread. 

FOR SINGERS AND PUBLIC SPEAKERS. Dissolve a tablespoontul 
of beef jelly (domestic is better), in a cupful of boiling water. Eat 
generously.

SPANISH WOOL. A Cosmetic. Separate the coloring matter from 
safflower by washing them until the water that comes off is colorless; 
dry, powder and digest in a weak solution of carbonate of soda ; 
then place some cotton wool at the bottom of the vessel and throw 
down the coloring matter by gradually adding lemon juice or white 
vinegar till it ceases to produce a precipitate. Next wash the cot- 
ton wool in cold watter, then dissolve out the color with a fresh solu- 
tion of soda : add a quantity of finely powdered French chalk, pro- 
portioned to the intended quantity of rouge ; mix well and precipi- 
tate as before. Lastly, collect the powder, dry with great care and 
triturate it with a minute quantity of oil of olives to render it smooth 
and adhesive. 

REMARK. This is the only article which will brighten a lady's 
complexion without injuring the skin. The relative fineness of the 
chalk and the proportion employed determine the quality of the 
rouge. 

CRESSON ROUGE, OR SPANISH WOOL. It is very convenient to 
use cotton or crape for absorbing coloring matter. It should be put 
in the dye before the lemon juice or citric acid is added, and after- 
wards washed in water to remove the acid. 

COLD CREAM FOR THE SKIN. 1-2 pound of new sweet lard, 4 ozs. 
white wax ; melt together. When nearly cold, perfume to fancy. 
Or, add to the above i 1-2 ozs. spermaceti ; melt together and 
gradually add i pint of oil of sweet almonds instead of the lard. 
Have ready a porcelain mortar warmed with hot water and after- 
wards thrown out; pour in the melted wax etc. and add gradually i 
pint of distilled rose water; if not to be had, use spring water, (rain 
water will not answer). Take particular care, after each addition of 
water, that it is well incorporated with the grease, and remove with a 
knife the portions that remain attached to the sides, so that the 
whole may be homogeneous. If the water be added too fast, the 
greater part will come out of the grease, and it cannot be incorpo- 
rated again without beginning the process ; when the water is all in, 
add 10 or 20 drops of attar of roses and fill the pots immediately. 
Tap them on a firm surface to make the cream settle smoothly, re- 
sembling wax. If desired, i or 2 ozs. of alcohol may be added, 
It is better to puc into wide mouthed bottles. The cream will keep 
good for 12 months. 

GLYCERINE CREAM. Excellent for chapped hands or skin ; white 
wax, 4 drachms; spermacetti, 2 drachms; oil of almonds, 2 ozs.; 
melt the wax and spermacetti, add the oil and 2 ozs. of glycerine; 
stir until cold. 

HOME MADE COURT PLASTER. i ounce French isinglass, i pint 
of warm water j stir it until it dissolves; add 10 cents' worth of 



LADIES' TOILET. 543 

pure glycerine, 5 cents' worth of tincture of arnica, lay a piece of 
white or black silk on a board, and paint it over with the mixture, 
then dry a little and put it on a flat surface to dry. 

COURT PLASTER. Suspend your silk on a wooden frame, then 
tack it on; dissolve some pure isinglass, apply the glue with a 
brush and let it dry ; repeat it, and when dry cover it over with a 
strong tincture of the balsam of Peru. This is genuine English 
court plaster. It is pliable and never breaks. You can use what 
color of silk you may like to form your plaster. It should be put 
only on one side. 

To CLEAN COMBS. If it can he avoided never wash combs, as 
the water often makes the teeth split, and the tortoise shell or horn 
of which they are made rough. Small brushes, manufactured pur- 
posely for cleaning combs, may be purchased at a trifling cost. 
With this the comb should be well brushed, and afterwards wiped 
with a cloth or towel. 

To WASH HORN BRUSHES. Dissolve a piece of soda in some hot 
water, allowing a piece the size of a walnut to a quart of water, or 
1-2 teaspoonful of hartshorn; put the water into a basin, and after 
combing out the hair from the brushes, dip them, bristles down- 
wards, into the water and out again, keeping the backs and handles 
as free from the water as possible. Repeat this until the bristles 
look clean, then rinse the brushes in a little cold water, shake them 
well, and wipe the handles and backs with a towel, but not the bris- 
tles, and set the brushes to dry in the sun or near the fire, but not 
too close to it ; wiping the bristle of a brush makes them soft, as 
does also the use of soap. 

To REMOVE THE UNPLEASANT ODOR OF PERSPIRATION. Wash in 
a gallon of water to which i tablespoonful of compound spirits of 
ammonia is added. 

THE sweetest perfume is where there is none. 
FOR CHAFING. Wash in alum water or spirits of camphor and 
water, or a solution of borax or water. 

CHAPPED HANDS OR LIPS. Persons washing in oils never have 
chapped hands, lips or chillblains. A little oil or unguent of any 
kind well rubbed over the hands on retiring at night, (removing 
the superfluous portion with a cloth), will not only preserve them 
from cold, but render them beautifully soft. 

NUMBED OR TREMBLING HANDS, AN EXCELLENT WASH FOR. 
Wash the hands frequently, when so affected, in a strong decoc- 
tion of worm wood and pounded mustard seeds; strained and 
used cold. 

To REMOVE WARTS FROM THE HANDS. Pare the warts so as not 
to make them bleed, then bathe them night and morning with 
ammonia.

To PRESERVE FLOWERS WITH THEIR NATURAL COLORS. The 
mode in which the operation is effected, is this: A vessel with a move- 
able cover and bottom is provided, and having removed the cover 
from it, a piece of metalic gauze of moderate firmness is fixed over 
it, and the cover replaced. A quantity of sand is then taken suffi- 
cient to fill the vessel and is passed through a seive into an iron pot, 
when it is heated, with the addition of a small quantity of stearine, 
carefully refined, so as to thoroughly mix the ingredients. The 
quantity ot stearine to be added is at the rate of 1-2 Ib. to 100 Ibs. of 
sand. Care must be taken not to add too much stearine, as it would 
sink to the bottom, and injure the flowers. The vessel with its cover 



6546 LADIES* TOILET. 

on, and the gauze beneath it, is then turned upside down, and the 
bottom being removed, the flowers to be operated upon are carefully 
placed on the gauze, and the sand gently poured in, so as to cover 
the flowers entirely, the leaves prevented from touching each other. 
The vessel is then put into a hot place, such for instance, as the top 
of a baker's oven, when it is left for 18 hours. The flowers thus be- 
come dried, and they retain their natural colors. The vessel still re- 
maining bottom upwards. The lid is taken off and the sand runs 
away through the gauze, leaving the flowers uninjured. 

METHOD OF EXTRACTING ESSENCES FROM FLOWERS. Petals of any 
flowers which have an agreeable fragrance, take thin layers of cotton 
batting, which dip into the finest florence or succo oil. Sprinkle a 
small quantity of fine salt on the flowers, lay them on a layer of cot- 
ton and a layer of flowers, until an earthern vessel or a wide mouth- 
ed glass vessel is full. Tie the top close or tie with a ground glass 
stopper, then lay the vessels in a south aspect to the heat of the sun, 
and in fifteen days when uncovered, a fragrant oil may be squeezed 
out of the whole mass, little inferior (if that flower is made use of)to 
the dear and much valued otto or attar of roses. The flowers should 
be removed and others added and continue to repeat the process 
until sufficiently strong. 

COLOR ARRANGEMENTS. A few simple rules in the arrangement 
of flower beds, will materially enhance the effect produced. Among 
these are: rst. Avoid rose-colored next to scarlet, orange, or violet. 
2d. Do not place orange next to yellow, or blue next to violet. 3d. 
White relieves any color, but do not place it next to yellow. 4th. 
Orange goes well with blue, yellow with violet. $th. Rose color 
and purple always go well together. 

How TO PRESS FLOWERS. Lay the flowers carefully on a thin 
sheet- of cotton batting, then cover them over with another sheet of 
batting;, then put them under a slight pressure, being careful not to 
rumple them. But if the flowers are thick and contain a good deal 
of moisture, change the cotton batting the next day ; lay the flowers 
smoothly and carefully, after which let them remain until dry. In 
pressing nearly all the small flowers, the cotton need not be changed, 
nor even opened, until the flowers are preserved.

rose, or hundred leaf or cabbage rose, as the vessel will hold, then 
carefully bring it to a boil in a perfectly clean porcelain or earthen 
vessel ; then boil it slowly till the leaves are a pulp, then add some 
more boiling water. Pour into an earthen pan, the night before, 
and while hot, place the jar 2-3 deep in a running stream. In the 
morning the attar appears like oil on the surface of the water ; then

of oil of vitivent added to 1-2 lb. of orris root powder, will be a sub- 
stitute. 

SCENT POWDER. A charming recipe for scent powder, to be used

PERFUME FROM FADED ROSE LEAVES. When the roses in your 
bouquet fade, put them in a small flower dish with a little salt at the 
bottom; then sprinkle the leaves over with alcohol. Some keep 
large vases for this purpose, in room, to produce a pleasant atmos- 
phere about the house.

spermaceti, a little alkanet root, a large juicy apple chopped_ fine, a 
bunch of black grapes bruised; 1-4 pound unsalted batter and 2

TJJE BEST and quickest way to clean kid gloves is this : Wash 
your hands and wrists perfectly clean, wipe them dry, put on your 
gloves and fasten them as if going out. Pour as much gasoline in 
your wash bowl as will enable you to comfortably wash your hands, 



LADIES' TOILET. 549 

and then wash your hands, gloves and all, carefully rubbing every 
dirty spot. When clean, let the gloves remain on until dry, which 
will be soon. You will be surprised to find how white your hands 
are, and how dirty the gasoline. Mrs. Viehle. 

To CLEAN GLOVES. Pour some gasoline into a wide-mouthed 
bottle, then put your gloves in, say 1-2 dozen pairs, more or less, 
see thut they are just covered with the fluid, then stop the bottle, 
and continue to shake it up and down until the gloves are clean, 
and if very dirty pour off the fluid and add some more, and con- 
tinue to shake up and down, then with some wooden tongs, or with 
your fingers, hang them to a clean clothes' line with clothes pins in 
the sun to dry, or if the weather is damp put the gloves on a sheet 
of perfectly clean paper and put them in a luke-warm stove, and 
they will soon dry. Be .careful not to let the oven be too warm. 
The warmth will remove the oder. 

GLOVES, KID LIGHT, TO CLEAN. Rub in them cream of tartar or 
magnesia with a piece of clean white flannel. 

COLORING WHITE KID GLOVES EITHKR BLACK OR PURPLE. With 
a solution of logwood i part, extract of logwood and 3 parts brandy. 
Put the gloves on both hands, apply with a sponge or rag and rub 
thoroughly dry, and keep rubbing the hands together so as to soften 
the gloves. 

To DYE GLOVES. Take the color suitable for the occasion ; if 
dark, take Spanish brown and black earth ; if lighter, yellow and 
whiting, and soon with other colors; mix them over a moderate 
fire, daub the gloves over with the color, wet, and let them hang till 
they are dry, and then beat out the superfluity of the color and 
smooth them over with a stretching or sleeking stick, reducing them 
to a proper shape. 

To DYE GLOVES BROWN OR TAN COLOR. 10,000 recipes. Steep 
saffron flowers in soft or rain water, boiling for 12 hours, then hav- 
ing sewed the tops of the gloves to prevent the dye from staining 
the insides, wet them with a sponge or brush dipped in the liquid ; 
the quantity of saffron as well as the water will, of course, depend 
on how much dye may be wanted, and their relative proportions on 
the depth of color required. A common teacupful will contain suf- 
ficient in quantity for a single pair of gloves. 

VEGETABLE DENTRIFICE OR TOOTH POWDER. Peruvian bark, 
gum myrrh and castile soap, each 2 ounces ; bole ammonian, the 
soft part of cuttlefish bone, rose pink and carbonate of magnesia, 
each 4 ounces ; orris root, 8 ounces, all in very fine powder ; per- 
fume with 30 drops of any essential oil ; sassafras, winter green, 
lavender, rose, cinnamon or cloves prepared ; after well mixing pass 
through a fine muslin sieve. It is best to have the rose pink and 
soap well dried before powdering. 



550 LADIES TOILET. 

CHARCOAL AND CHALK TOOTH POWDER. To 4 ounces of char- 
coal add 3 of finely pulverized chalk or prepared chalk, or orris, 
and sufficient honey to form a paste. 

SAN FRANCISCO TOOTH POWDER. Take a little suds made with 
castile soap and an equal amount of spirits of camphor, then thicken 
with finely pulverized chalk and charcoal, equal quantities, to a thick 
paste ; apply with the finger or soft cloth, or wooden brush, rubbing 
thoroughly. It will whiten the teeth more than the majority of tooth 
powders. Badger's hair is soft, and is good to work between the 
teeth. Moisten with a' little camphor as you use it. Never use 
stiff bristle brushes, as they permanently injure the gums, which 
causes the teeth to decay. 

CHINESE DENTRIFICE. Ashes of dried rice finely pulverized. 
Press through a fine muslin sieve ; perfume with any essential oils. 

REMOVING AND RESETTING TEETH. Both in England and America 
dentists have extracted teeth, cleaned, removed coaries from the 
crown and replaced them in the sockets, where they again took fresh 
root and the tooth remained sound. 

EAR ACHE. Indian remedy. Take a piece of a lean mutton 
about the size of a small plum.burn it till perfectly charred on the out- 
side, then put in a clean rag and squeeze into a spoon, and drop this 
not too hot into the ear, if too hot it might be fatal in consequence. 

EAR ACHE. Saturate a piece of cotton batting with arnica, or 3 or 
4 drops just warmed into the ear. 

EAR ACHE. Moisten a piece of cotton with equal portions of 
spirit campor, sweet oil and laudanum. 

EAR ACHE. Take a clove or garlic or onion, toast it till soft, dip 
it in sweet oil and put it in the ear. The pain will soon cease. After 
removal, insert some cotton wool to keep out the cold. 

CURE FOR THE TOOTHACHE. Take a piece of sheet zinc, about 
the size of a dime, and a piece of silver, say 25 cents; place them 
together, and hold the defective tooth between them or contiguous 
to them; in a few minutes the pain will be gone, as if by magic. The 
zinc and silver, acting as a galvanic battery, will produce on the 
nerves of the tooth sufficient electricity to establish a current, and 
consequently to remove the pain. 

TOOTHACHE. A strong solution of peppermint, red pepper and 
spirits of camphor dropped on cotton wool then lay this over. 

JUMPING TOOTHACHE. Opium dissolved in the oil of cloves, 
dropped on a cotton wool and applied to the tooth will relieve. 

MYRRH AND BORA.X TOOTH WASH. Rub well into a mortar, i oz. 
of borax and honey, then gradually add i quart spirits of wine, (not 
above proof) and add i oz. of gum myrrh and red sandal wood. 
Macerate for 14 days, and filter. This is an excellent wa^h for the 
gums and mouth.

HEALTH NOTES AND MAXIMS. 

SLEEP, it is said, by a great thinker, repairs the waste which wak- 
ing hours have made. It builds up the system; the night is the repair 
shop for the body. Every part of the system is thoroughly overhaul- 
ed, and the organs; tissues and substances are replenished. Wak- 
ing consumes and exhausts, sleep replaces and repairs. A man who 
would be a good worker must be a good sleeper. A man has as 
much force in him as he is provided for in sleep. 

CURE FOR SLEEPLESSNESS. It is said, that when overwakeful, get 
out of bed, dip a piece of cloth in water, lay this around the wrist; 
then wrap the dry portion over this and pin it, to keep it in place. 
This will exert a composing inflence over the nervous system, and 
producing a sweet sleep, reducing the pulse; a handkerchief folded 
lengthwise will do. It is easy ; try it. 

WHO REQUIRE THE MOST SLEEP. Hard thinking people. Time, 
taken from necessary hours of sleep, is lost, and it soon causes days 
of physical and mental indisposition to application and often suffer- 
ing ; and which, often repeated, if not fatal, renders the violator of 
natures laws more or less a sufferer during life. The man of busi- 
ness with a thousand cares upon his mind, the student, or the over 
working professional man, are the greatest sufferers from loss of 



ep 

A DEADLY foe to a long life is an unnatural and unreasonable excite- 
ment Eating too much and too fast and swallowing imperfectly 
masticated food ; by taking too much fluid at meals, keeping late 
hours at night and sleeping too late in the morning ; wearing cloth- 



552 HEALTH NOTES. 

ing too tight, so as to relax the circulation, wearing thin shoes, 
neglecting exercise and not washing the skin. 

MERCURY. Never give mercury to a debilitated patient. 

FOB PERSONS WHO WALK A GREAT DEAL. To prevent the feet 
from soreness, rub them well with a mixture of equal parts of alco- 
hol and castor oil ; let it remain a few minutes, then with a cloth 
wipe it off. 

SLEEP. One hour's sleep will often cure a mild form of indiges- 
tion. 

How TO PRODUCE SLEEP. One grain of camphor in the form of a 
pill, followed by t-2 oz. of the infusion of hops ; or, 1-2 teacupfulof 
hop tea with 5 drops sulphur ether ; or, bathe the head with cam- 
phor. 

SHOULD persons be overtaken by a shower it is best, if at work, 
to continue to work busily until dry, if not able to change at once 
your clothing. If walking, continue to walk rapidly on until your 
clothing is dry, or on reaching home change your clothing with- 
out delay. Then take something hot, as lemonade, hot water and 
vinegar, &c., instantly; rub yourself down thoroughly with a coarse 
towel or brush. It is best to put on woolen clothing and wrap up 
warm in bed, and take something hot again, and go to sleep if you 
can, and in an hour rise up and dress yourself; if it be during the 
day, then move about. It possible, in removing damp clothes, it 
should be done before the fire. No one should sit in damp cloth- 
ing, for in doing so persons are oftener than otherwise attacked with 
a violent cold, pneumonia or pleurisy, which, if not fatal, may take 
years to recover from. 

AIR, HOT AND COLD. Warm air is not necessarily impure, nor 
cold air necessarily pure. 

NECESSITY OF GOOD VENTILATION IN ROOMS LIGHTED WITH GAS. 
In dwelling houses lighted with gas the frequent renewal of the 
air is of great importance. A single gas burner will consume oxi- 
gen and produce more carbonic acid to deteriorate the atmosphere 
of the room than six or eight candles. If therefore, when several 
burners are used, no provision is made fur the escape of the cor- 
rupted air and for the introduction of pure air from without ; the 
health will necessarily suffer. 

BLOOD AND AIR. The air is a purifier of the blood, and the more 
we take in the more perfectly is that process performed ; hence the 
more a consumptive stays in the house the more certain and speedy 
his death. 

WEAK EYES. Persons with weak eyes should not read or write, 
or do fine sewing, on an empty stomach, 

WARM BEDS, Getting out of a warm bed and going to an open 
door or window has been the death of multitudes. 



HEALTH NOTES. 553 

FLAXSEED should be free from rancidity when used either in teas 
or poultices. . . 

. REMEDY FOR A WEAK BACK. Take a beefs gall, pour it into a 
pint of alcohol, and rub the spine with it frequently. 

INFALLIBLE REMEDIES. For bile, exercise ; for rheumatism, flan- 
nel and patience ; for gout, toast and water. 

THE BED-ROOM. In a word, the bed-room for the third of this 
mortal life, and that third the most helpless, should be a sanctuary 
of cleanliness and order, in which no injurious exhalation can re- 
main for a moment, and no trace of uncleanliness offend a single 
sense. 

CHANGING warm clothing too early in spring often brings on severe 
colds. 

DOMESTIC REMEDIES USED IN LONDON IOO YEARS AGO. 

FOR A BURN. Whisk well together equal portions of raw white 
of egg and sweet oil, paint the burn with a feather, and then apply 
cotton wool to it well saturated with the mixture. 

POWDER TO CLEAN THE TEETH. Beat and sift through muslin 
i 1-2 ounce each of dragon's blood, cinnamon, burnt alum, very 
fine ; rub a little on the teeth every other day. 

PILES. Make an ointment by stewing bruised leaves of James- 
town weed in lard or fresh butter, adding a few drops of laudanum. 
Or a mixture of green white raspberry leaves and new milk or cream 
together. 

WEAK EYES. 5 cents worth of elder flowers (or just gather 
from the shrub); steep well in a gill of soft water in an earthen 
vessel or one of new tin, strain through a cloth, then add 3 drops 
of laudanum; bottle tight; keep in a. cool place. Touch the 
eyes, letting some get into the eyes. Put some on a cloth, wet it, 
and bind it to the eyes. Use freely. 

N. B. A tea made of elder flowers, drank freely, if the eyes are 
inflamed. This tea cleanses the blood. Avoid minerals, they injure 
the eye. 

DYSPEPTIC LYE. Pour 1-2 gallon of boiling water over 2 cups of 
hickory or willow lye and i cup of soot in a suitable vessel ; stir 
and let it remain until perfectly clear, then pour off and bottle 
closely; 1-2 tumbler full weakened with water until palatable; use 
3 times a day. An excellent remedy for dyspepsia ; I know it is. 

REMEDY FOR INDIGESTION. Boil 1-2 pint of white wheat 3 hours 
in a quart of water, or a little more, if necessary. Drink 1-2 pint 
of the liquid 2 or 3 times a week. 

VALUABLE REMEDIES. Dyspepsia, by going without supper; spit- 



554 HEALTH NOTES. 

ting blood, by eating salt ; epilepsy, by water melons ; kidney affec- 
tions, by celery; poison, olive or sweet oil; erysipelas, pounded 
cranberries applied to the part affected; hrydrophobia, by onions.

boil for 15 minutes in a quart of water; strain and pour in a bottle 
or jug, then add, when cold, the juice of i lemon or some powdered 
citric and sugar to tsste. 

DYSPEPSIA AND MILK. Before each meal drink a glass of sweet 
milk, the richer the better. Or take a tablespoonful of wheat bran 
before each meal. 



BILIOUS COLIC. 

BILIOUS COLIC. Make a poultice of the bran of corn meal, 
sprinkle mustard over it, and apply it as hot as can be borne to the 
bowels. This is said to give instant relief. Drink pepper or spear- 
mint tea. 

FOR COLIC. One-half hour before or after dinner, eat 6 blue or 
purple figs, either dried or not. They are also good for dyspeptics, 
and should be eaten daily until entirely relieved. 

N. B. The foregoing recipe I obtained from the widow of a Rus- 
sian physician, a highly accomplished lady. 

BILIOUS COLIC. Give hot lemonade, or sweet oil a tablespoonful 
every hour until relieved. 

COLIC. Make a strong tea of the vervain roots and all, by pour- 
ing boiling water over, when washed. Drink hot. 

JAUNDICE. 

DRINK FOR JAUNDICE. It is said to be a sure cure. Put equal 
parts of saffron and soot in a bag and let it lie in a glass of water 
over night ; in the morning put the yolk of an egg broken into the 
water and drink it. Do this 3 mornings, skipping 3, until 9 doses 
have been taken. 

JAUNDICE. One penny-worth each of allspice, flour of sulphur 
and turmeric ; these to be well pounded together, and afterwards to 
be mixed with 1-2 Ib. of molasses ; 2 tablespoonfuls to be taken 
every day. 

LIVER SPOTS. Make a mixture of powdered sulphur and spirits 
of any kind, and rub the place 3 or 4 times a day until it almost 
bleeds, then wash with soap and water. 

A WHOLESOME DRINK FOR BILIOUS AND SALLOW-COMPLEXIONED 
PEOPLE. Boil 1-2 hour 1-2 ounce each of spruce, hemlock, dande- 
lion, yellow dock, burdock, sarsaparill^. bark in a gallon pf water ; 



HEALTH NOTES. 555 

strain while hot through a cloth, then mix together 10 drops each of 
oil of sassafras and spruce and add it to the decoction ; let it stand 
till cold, and then add 1-2 cup of yeast and 1-2 pound of brown 
sugar or molasses. After 12 hours in the jar, closely covered, draw 
off and bottle. Drink plentifully with ice in it in summer. 

FOR JAUNDICE. French physician. Drink strong water in which 
carrots have been boiled, instead of water, and eat the carrots. 

CONSUMPTION. 

A PLEASANT PBEVENTATIVE OF CONSUMPTION. Set 2 new laid 

eggs in hot water until they are thoroughly warm, without suffering 
the whites to get hard, then make a small hole in the top of each, 
pour off the whites as expeditiously as possible, and fill up the eggs 
with rose water, powdered sugar and cinnamon ; warm them again 
in the embers or stove and eat them as soon as sufficiently done. 
This may be taken twice a days will be found very strengthening. 

LEMON IN CONSUMPTION. London Lancet. Put a dozen lemons 
in cold water and bring to a boil ; boil slowly until the lemns are 
soft, but not too soft; then squeeze until all the juice is extracted; 
add sugar to your taste and drink. In this way use i dozen lemons 
a day. If they cause pain or loosen the bowels too much, lessen 
the quantity to 5 or 6 a day, until you are better, and then begin 
again with a dozen a day. After using 5 or 6 dozen the patient 
will begin to gain flesh and enjoy food. Hold on to the lemons and 
still use them very freely for several weeks more. A free use ol 
lemon or lime juice will always relieve a cough. Most people feel 
poorly in the spring, but if they eat a lemon before breakfast every 
day for a week, with or without sugar, as they like, they will find it 
better than any medicine. Lemon juice used according to the 
above recipe will sometimes cure consumption, and is good for en- 
feebled persons. It certainly is "not bad to take," besides possess- 
ing the negative virtue that " it will do no harm, if it does no 
good." 

FOOD FOR CONSUMPTION. Strong mullen tea sweetened* with 
brown sugar, and drink freely for 6 months. It is good for the 
blood, and strengthens the system. 

N. B. Gather it in July, dry it in the shade, and keep in clean 
paper bags. 

PULMONARY DISEASE. Go early in the morning, and when the 
pine bushes begin to put out tender buds, eat the buds on a fasting 
stomach. The taste is a little acidulous and not unpleasant. The 
resinous oil contained in the pine buds will do good to weak lungs. 
The tea of these is good, closely bottled, with a little Holland gin. 



556 HEALTH NOTES. 

added to keep it from souring. This can be kept for winter use, 
and in wet weather, when the patient cannot go out, which should 
not be neglected in dry mornings. Even chewing the buds is bene- 
ficial. The white pine buds are best. 

FOR CONSTIPATION. 

SENNA. Infuse for one hour then strain i-i ounce of senna; 1-2 
dram sliced ginger; 1-2 pint of boiling water. Taste concealed by 
some black tea or coffee sweetened. See that nothing enters that 
is spurious. 

GRAPE SEEDS CURE COS*ITVENESS and the pulp is pure nutriment. 
Cracked wheat is good, bnt should not be eaten all the time. It 
promotes the growth of the bones and strength of the teeth, vigor 
of the brain and life and elasticity of the whole man. Five ounces 
of sugar a day will increase a man's weight one pound in a week. 

GOOD FOR THIRST AND CONSTIPATION. One-half gill of dried 
raspberries, in a pint of the purest water, in a closely covered 
earthern vessel, set in a cool place. Let stand 3 or 4 hours, then 
eat the fruit, and drink the water. 

HEADACHE. 

EAT THE BLANCHED STALKS OF CELERY. Good for nervousness 
and heart disease. 

INVALUABLE FOR NERVOUS PERSONS. 1-2 dr. of ammonia, com- 
pound tincture of cardoman, 1-2 ounce; oil of lavender, 8 drops; 
mint water, 3 oz. Mix, divide and take in 3 doses. 

WEAK NERVES. Dr. Floterean. Drink freely of scullcap tea. 

NKRVOUS HEADACHE. One quart of cider, 3 tablespoonfuls each 
of white mustard seed and burdock seed, a small radish root well 
steeped together. To be kept in a bottle well corked. Dose. A 
wine glassful 2 or 3 times a day. 

LEMONS FOR HEADACHE. Take a gill of lemon juice. It is a 
good stomachic, gives tones to the nerves, and is good for rheuma- 
tism and neuralgia, if taken in large doses. 

SICK HEADACHE. Mrs. S. Take some chicken gall and com- 
mon flour, and make into pills the average size and when the head 
ache is coming on, take from 3 to 5 of the pills and it gives relief. 
The recipe was given by a lady who had used them for years with 
great benefit. 

FOR HEADACHE. Pour a few drops of ether on one-half ounce 
of gum camphor to pulverize, add to this an equal quantity of cor- 
bonate ammonia pulverized; add 20 drops peppermint; mix and put 
in an open mouthed bottle with a glass stopper. 



HEALTH NOTES. 557 

OBSTINATE NAUSEA. Apply a hot mustard plaster to the pit of 
the stomach. In ordinary cases, a flannel dipped in hot camphor, 
wring out, and while pouring apply to stomach. It often relieves. 
A drop of spirits of camphor in a spoonful of water and administer- 
ed every fifteen or twenty minutes for an hour or longer, allays the 
nauseau; The mustard plaster should be applied. 

DYSPEPTICS AND DYSPEPSIA. 

LIME WATER, ITS VALUE. Take a large lump of unslacked lime 
and pnt into a new wooden vessel not painted, and pour over it 
gradually, four gallons of hot water, and stir it perpetually, then let 
it settle, and pour the clear fluid into bottles and cork closely. It 
is an excellent remedy for children while teething and in summer 
complaints, allowing a teaspoonful to a cup of milk or tea and for 
any person with diarrhea, adding it to milk. It is pleasant to take. 
It will prevent milk from curdling after a hot night and prevent it 
from souring in tea or coffee. As a cleanser and purifier it is valua- 
ble to any housekeeper, and even in the nursery. A cupful or more 
made up with the sponge of cake or bread made at night, will pre- 
vent it fermenting and make it sweet. 

MINT JULEP. 3 or 5 sprigs of mint fresh gathered and put in a 
tumbler one-half full of sherry, put some pounded ice in a second 
tumbler, and pour the mint and sherry over it, rapidly transfenng 
the liquor several times from one tumbler to another for a minute 
or two in ice, till frozen partices form over the top. This is a very 
refreshing drink.

soon learn to eat, if not like it. 

FOR HEARTBURN. Juice of one orange, water and lump sugar to 
flavor in proportionto the acidity of the orange, bicarbonate of soda 
about 1-2 teaspoonful. Mix orange juice, water, and sugar together 
in a tumbler, then put in the soda and stir, and the effervesence en- 
sues. 

DIGESTIVE TINCTURE. Powdered rhubarb, orange peel, carraway 
seed, each one ounce. Infuse the ingredients in a quart of white 
wine for three days, pour off and take a half wmeglassful when

558 HEALTH NOTES, 

into a large pitcher, add a pint of N. O. molasses and pour over them 
1-2 gal. water. Stir up thoroughly, steep and cover closely ; when 
cold, add 2 pints of pure Holland gin and bottle closely. A wineglass- 
ful 3 times a day, but if the cough is troublesome, take a tablespoon- 
ful every hour in the day until you go to sleep at night. If you wake 
up with a spell of coughing, take a spoonful, and the first thing in 
the morning. It is good for hoarseness, asthma, &c. Nearly all of 
these valuable herbs can be grown in the garden. The blood root, 
poplar and boneset are easily found in nearly all of the southern, 
western and middle states, where they can be had fresh, if in the 
country.

of a strong decoction of the common mullen. Allow 1-2 Ib. of rich 
sugar to i pint of the tea, boil to a syrup and bottle for use. It is 
very healing to the lungs, even for inflammation and bleeding of these 
vital organs. It is better to gather the plant in July, dry it in the 
shade, and keep in paper bags. 

DRY COUGH. Wesley. Chew Peruvian bark and swallow the 
spittle. It seldom fails to cure. 

STOMACH PLASTER FOR A COUGH. Melt together an oz. each of 
resin, Burgundy pitch and beeswax, in a clean pipkin, and then stir

whole plaster and apply it warm to the region of the stomach. 

SYRUP OF GARLIC. Dr. Warren. Take 8 or 10 bulbs of fresh 
garlic, sliced and bruised, i pint of diluted fruit vinegar, 2 Ibs. of 
refined sugar ; macerate the garlic in to ozs. of the diluted apple 
vinegar in a glass vessel, to express the liquor, then mix the rest 
with what remains of the acid and again express, till enough has 
passed to make the whole, when filtered, measure a pint ; then pour 
the filtered liquor on the sugar in a bottle; and shake till dissolved.

sugar, simmered for 30 minutes in 3 cupfuls of water till it looks 
clear and begins to thicken ; when cold, add a teaspoonful of para- 
goric. Dose: i tablespoonful for an adult and i teaspoonful fora 
child, or less, taken now and then. This is excellent in throat and 
lung diseases, and difficulty in breathing and strangulation. 

REMEDY FOR BRONCHITIS Take honey in the comb, squeeze i 
out and dilute it with a little water ; wet the lips and mouth occa- 
sionally with it. It has never been known to fail in cases where 
children had throats so swollen as to be unable to swallow. It is a 
simple remedy; and comes well recommended.

WHOOPING COUGH. With its mode of treatment. Is purely a 
spasmodic disease of an infectious or epidemic nature, anc

known by, when in advanced shape, the peculiar long inspiration 
or "whoop," which attends it, and those who are with the patient 
often have every symptom of -the genuine whooping cough, called 
sympathetic cough, which though not dangerous, is ver Y 
agonizing. Symtoms. Whooping cough comes on with sneezing, 
running at the nose slight oppression of breathing, weakness in the 
organs of sight, thirst, quick pulse, hoarseness and a hard, dry 
cough. At the expiration of two or three weeks (there being no 
change in the disease) the whoop sets in, the peculiar feature of the 
malady, which is so common, that it is unnecessary to treat the 
subject, physiologically. Vomiting and bleeding at the mouth or 
nose, are favorable symptoms. The treatment varies greatly with 
the nature of the attack and the state of the health of the child. At 
first, there is generally some degree of acute bronchitis and the lower- 
ing measures will be necessary to keep up a state of nausea and 
vomiting, giving the child doses of ipecac, and antimonial 
wines, in equal parts, and quantities varying from half to one and a 
half teaspoonsfuls once a day, or when the expectoration is hard 
and difficult, give the following cough mixture ever four hours. Of 
syrup of squils, 1-2 oz.; antimonial wine, i oz.; laudanum, 15 drops; 
syrup of toulou, 2 drams; water, 1-2 oz.; mix well. The dose is 
from 1-2 teaspoonful to a dessert spoonful. If the cough is very 
bad, the warm bath is used, and either one or two leeches applied 
on the breastbone, or a small blister laid on the lower part of the 
throat. If the bowels are costive, sweet spirits of nitre, ipecac, and 
rhubarb may be used. 

WHOOPING COUGH. Simmer together over a slow fire equal parts 
of vinegar, sweet oil, and honey, for a few minutes, then bottle and 
cork closely for use. Excellent in the troublesome disease. Take 
a spoonful as often as necessary. 

CURE FOR WHOOPING COUGH. The late discovery of a cure for 
whooping cough by inhaling the ordors of the gas house, is found to 
be of real benefit (so said by physicians). The children are taken 
to the gas works, where they breathe the not very pleasant air there 
produced, and there is something in the chemical combination that 
cures whooping cough. The people at the gas works state that 
during the last 12 months, 300 cases of whooping cough have thus 
been experimented upon. 

WHOOPING COUGH. Pound a cupful of flax seed, 3 oz. of liquor, 
3 spoonfuls of strained honey; 3 spoonfuls of loaf sugar; put these 
into 4 cupfuls or a quart of water; boil till reduced to one-half; give 
frequently. Hogs lard and molasses in equal quantities are good 
with a little laudanam, and also sugar and butter stewed together. 

WHOOPING COUGH SYRUPS. Strongest West India rum, i pint; 



HEALTH NOTES. 561

tablesoonful, 4 times a day. Children 2 teaspoonfu) with sugar and 
water 4 times a day. 

WHOOPNG COUGH MIXTURE. Equal portions of honey, New Eng- 
land rum, hnseed oil. Dose. i teaspoonful, when the cough is 
troublesome. 

CHRONIC SORES. 

CHRONIC SORES (excellent.) Make a poultice of chick weed. 
The juice mixed with lard is good for erysipelas and other cu- 
taneous diseases. 

FOR SORES. Make a smooth, soft paste of brown sugar and 
yellow soap and apply it. 

OBSTINATE ULCERS may be cured with sugar dissolved in a strong 
decoction of walnut leaves. 

ULCERS. Dry and reduce to powder a black walnut leaf and 
strew it on the sore, and then lay several walnut leaves over it ; 
bind. Or foment morning and night with a decoction of walnut 
leaves, and then apply them ; bind some leaves over the sore. Or 
boil some walnut leaves in water with a little molasses or sugar. 
Dip a cloth in the mixture and apply once in two days. A valuable 
remedy. 

FOR MORTIFICATION A poultice of oatmeal and hops. Apply. 
A poultice of oatmeal and charcoal is also good. 

ANOTHER FOR WHITE SWELLING. Aunt Nancy Patterson, col- 
ored. Boil together smart weed, chamber lye and wheat bran ; 
make a poultics of this and apply to the whole limb ; wrap it up in 
it. This, has also cured as the other, when physicians could do 
nothing to relieve when the bones came out in splinters. 

URINE, BLOODY. Wesley. Make a strong tea of yarrow and 
drink it copiously twice a day. 

HOT OR SCALDING URINE. Ground ivy in flax seed tea and a 
little sweet spirits of nitre and root of asparagus. Drink also cool- 
ing and mucilaginous drinks. Buttermilk is also good. 

HORSE RADISH. It is said that an infusion of the fresh root drank 
freely every night, will cause perspiration and free flow of urine and 
will consequently cure dropsy. It promotes digestion, the fresh 
ground root in vinegar, eaten with meat, strengthens the stomach. 

DROPSY. 

OATS GOOD FOR DROPSY AND HEART DISEASE. Two handfuls of 
common oats, not cleaned; boil in 3 quarts of water for 1-2 hour. 
Strain the decoction ; take a teacupful frequently instead of water.

DROPSY ON THE CHEST. Cut small 1-2 pound of milk weed 
(dried), pour on it 2 pints of scalding water and simmer to 2 cup- 
fuls. When cool, add a pint of the best Holland gin ; pour both 
liquors and roots into a decanter, cork tight, and let stand 12 
hours. Give a grown up person 2 tablespoonfuls every 3 hours, 
day and night. If too nauseating, give less. Its good effects 
will be seen in 4 or 5 days. It has often been tried, and seldom 
without happy results. 

FOR DROPSY. Decoction of broom, 1-2 pint; i oz. of cream 
of tartar, 2 drachms of tincture of squills ; a third part 3 times a

DROWNING PERSONS. 

DROWNING PERSONS, How TO RESTORE SUCH TO LIFE. At all 
sea-bathing places, during summer, some one or more persons 
are certainly drowned. Dr. Hall says that unless in cold weather 
do not waste time in carrying the body to a house ; but right on 
the spot, within a rod of the water's edge, remove all clothing as 
far down as the navel, place it on its face over a bundle of straw 
or other soft substance, so that the stomach shall rest upon it ; press 
spasmodically with both hands on the back, so as to force all the 
water possible out of the lungs through the throat and mouth out- 
ward ; the next instant place the body face upwards with some- 
thing under the small of the back, and draw out the tongue ; then 
let another person get astride of the body, and with both hands, one 
on each side of the ribs, force the water out of the lungs, through 
the mouth, for a few seconds ; then withdraw the hands as suddenly 
as possible, put them on the ribs again, and proceed as before, the 
object being to push out the water with one operation, and by the 
other allow the air to rush into the lungs to supply its place. Keep 
on working in this way until you see signs of life, even if you have 
to work for two or three hours. As soon as breathing is restored, 
convey to a bed, if possible, and wrap up the naked body from head 
to foot in woolen blankets, in a warm room, with plenty of iresh air. 
Meanwhile give a drink of some hot liquid every five minutes for 
the first hour or two, allowing the body the most perfect rest possi- 
ble all the time, and besides promote composure of mind with as 
much encouragement as can be conscientiously given. Life is lost

by drowning simply by the water getting into the lungs and filling 
hem up, and thus preventing any air from getting into them, on 
the same principle of being smothered in any other way. Get 
the water out of the lungs and give natural warmth, which is 
antagonistic to death. On these depend the recovery of the 
patient. 

CATARRH is not a disease of the nose, but disease showing itself 
in the nose, a local exhibition of the constitutional derangement. 

CURE FOR CATARRH. To i ounce of glycerine add 15 or 20 
drops of carbolic acid, and thoroughly apply with a small sponge 
to be found at all drug stores, known as the ear sponge. The results 
are said to be happy. 

ALUM FOR CATARRH. Snuff pulverized alum, and the disease will 
disappear.

stantly subject to them from slight causes. 

NIGHT SWEATS. 

To RELIEVE NIGHT SWEATS. Dissolve 15 grains of sulphate of 
quinine in 1-2 oz. essence of tansy, 1-4 oz. alcohol, 1-4 oz. water, 30

daily of phosphate of lime. In the majority of cases, it will remove 
the trouble or diminish it. 

FOR HOARSENESS. 

REMEDY FOR HOARSENESS. Chewing the green root or leaves of 
horseradish will give instant relief to the most obstinate case of 
hoarseness. The green root, of course, possesses the most virtue, 
though the green learei are good ; both lose their strength when 
dry. Persons, just before begining to speak in public, will not be 
troubled with hoarseness if they use the the radish freely. 

FOR HOARSENESS. In a pint bowl squeeze the juice of 1-2 lem- 
on, add 2 tablespoonfuls of loaf sugar, i teaspoonful of glycerine and 
i full tablespoonful of whiskey ; pour over this boiling hot water to 
nearly fill the bowl and drink hot, just before going to bed.

under a strange name. 

MARSH MALLOWS. A tea of the green or dried leaves is excellent 
for a cough, sweetened with honey, sugar or molasses. N. B. It 
is good for kidney affections, diseases of the bowels, and also, if 
made into a paste candy, for coughs. 

WEAK LUNGS. Make a strong tea of a large handful each of hoar- 
hound and mullen, mixed, then add a cupful of molasses and stew 
to a syrup, the quicker the better. A tablespoonful 2 times a day. 



HEALTH NOTES. 565 



SPRAINS 

CURE FOR SPRAINS. A Paris remedy. If the ankle is sprained, 
for instance, let the operator hold the foot in his hands with the 
thumbs meeting on the swollen part, these having been previously 
greased, are pressed successively, with increasing force, on the in- 
jured, painful spot for 15 minutes. This application, repeated sev- 
eral times, will, in the course of the day, enable the patient to walk 
when other means failed to relieve him. 

A SPEKDY CURE FOR A SPRAIN. A large spoonful each of honey 
and salt, the white of an egg ; the whole beaten together for i hour, 
then let it stand and anoint the place sprained with the mixture, 
keeping the place well bandaged. This has been known to relieve 
in 24 hours, the patient walking free from pain. 

FOR SPRAINED ANKLE. Apply cloths dipped in salt and cold wa- 
ter, elevating the ankle and not walking. 

SPRAINS. Wash well the root of the black walnut tree, scrape off 
the outside skin, mash it to a poultice, then stir in vinegar to moisten 
it to a mush and apply with bandages to the seat of trouble. Mois- 
ten it every 3 or 4 hours. 

NEURALGIA. 

A SIMPLE REMEDY FOR NEURALGIA. Take 2 large tablespoonfuls 
of cologne and two tablespoonfuls of fine salt, mix them well togeth- 
er in a small bottle. Every time you have acute affection of the 
facial nerves or neuralgia, simply breathe the fumes in your nose 
from the bottle and you will be immediately relieved. 

To CURE NEUKALCUA. 1-2 dram of sal ammonia in i oz. of cam- 
phor spirits. Dose. i teaspoonful, and repeat several times, at an 
interval of five minutes until the pain ceases; try it. 

NEURALGIA IN FACE OR HEAD. Oil of peppermint applied with 
a small camel's hair pencil to the parts effected, will give instant re- 
lief. 

VIOLENT NEURALGIA, OR Tic DOLOREUX. Apply ice to the part 
four or five minutes, wait five or six minutes and apply again. The 
painful sensation prodced by the ice is relieved by holding alcohol 
in the mouth till the natural warmth returns. 

RHEUMATISM. 

CHRONIC RHEUMATISM, i oz. of Peruvian bark, 1-2 oz. of 
powdered rhubarb, infused in a bottle of wine. Take one, two, or

566 HEALTH NOTES. 

bowels gently open. Wear flannel next to the person, and make 
frequent use of the flesh brush. 

LUMBAGO. As a form of counter initiation, a new and successful 
mode of treating lumbago, has been advocated by several eminent 
physicians, which consists in the instantaneous application of a flat- 
iron bottom to the skin, which has been gently heated in a spirit 
lamp. It should be drawn lightly over the effected part. It is 
spoken so highly of, that it deserves attention. 

FOR RHEUMATISM. Make a poultice of the beaten leaves of the 
weeping willow and bind it to the joint. Renew if necessary. 

CHRONIC RHEUMATISM BITTERS. Prickly ash berries, spikenard 
root, yellow poplar, and white flowered dogwood barks, of each 1-2 
pound, all finely powdered and put in a gallon jug and fill up with 
good brandy. Dose. Wineglassful 3 times a day, before meals. 

ACUTE RHEUMATISM. Dr. B.'s recipe. 1-2 oz. each of sulphur, 
flowers of mustard, saltpetre, Turkey rhubarb, 1-4 oz. of .powdered 
griacum; mix. Dose. A tablespoonful taken every other night, 
and omitting three nights, and in a wineglass of cold water that has 
been well boiled. 

LEMON GRASS OIL is used as a stimulant in rheumatic affections; 
called oil of verbna by preference, 'grows in the West Indies and 
Australia. Some times called ginger grass oil, oil of geranium, oil 
of spikenard. It is a good liniment. Should be cut while in flower, 
tied in bundles and distilled as other flowers. 

GOOD LINIMENT FOR RHEUMATISM. i gill each of alcohol, beef's 
gall, spirits of turpentine and sweet or olive oil; 4 oz. gum camphor. 
Put them all in a bottle and shake it up; use it 2 or 3 times a day, a 
tablespoonful at a time. Apply it to the parts effected before the 
fire. It is good also for frost bites. 

ARNICA. i dram tincture of arnica, in 3 gills of alcohol. Un- 
rivaled for all fresh sprains, cuts, contused wounds, bruises, for rheu- 
matic joints, gouty pains, pains in the feet and limbs from walking. 
Shake well before using. 

RHEUMATISM. 1-4 oz. of saltpeter in a pint of alcohol; shake 
well and bathe parts effected, wetting red flannel with it, lay it on. 
If not a perfect cure, it relieves the torment and agony, and reduces 
the inflamation and swelling. 

RHEUMATISM, INFLAMATORY. 1-2 oz. saltpeter pulverized, in 1-2 
pint of sweet oil, bathe the parts effected. . 

ANOTHER FOR RHEUMATISM. Mrs. Dr. Kemp. Salycilate of

POISONOUS BITES, STINGS, HYDROPHOBIA. 

To REMOVE VIRUS IN HYDROPHOBIA. Apply a cupping glass 
over the wound as soon as possible, and keep it exhausted, then 
apply lunar caustic or nitric acid, and bind up the wound as tightly 
as the patient can bear it. Only one cauterization is necessary. 

YOUATT'S CORE FOR HYDROPHOBIA. Youatt (the great horse 
doctor) says he has been bitten 8 or 10 times, and always cured 
himself by rubbing nitrate of silver on the wound. It should be 
applied as soon after the accident as may be. In 6 weeks the 
virus is disseminated through the system and then hope is gone. 

PREVENTATIVE OF HYDROPHOBIA. Profuse prespiration by steam- 
ing, or any other way needful, which it is hoped may never be. 

SNAKE BITE. An Indian remedy. Take indigo and dissolve it 
in chamber lye, wet a cloth with the liquor and place it on the bite. 

POISONOUS STINGS OR BITES. Put on the place at once, a small 
piece of raw, fresh meat of any kind. 

WHEN POISONED. One teaspoonful each of mustard and salt in a 
tumbler of water, taken at once; it will, almost instantaneous- 
ly, produce nausea. Then give the whites of 2 eggs in a cup of 
strongest coffee ; if no coffee, swallow the egg with new cream ; if 
no cream, use sweet milk ; if no milk, swallow the eggs. 

FOR ANY KIND OF STING OR VENOMOUS BITE. Apply cucumber, 
honey, or a plaster of fresh yeast, which renew as often as it be- 
comes hot or dry. If the bite is dangerous, as that of an adder, give 
immediately a teaspoonful of spirits of hartshorn in a wineglass of 
cold water, and 40 drops more every 15 minutes, till the violent 
symptoms abate, or till medical advice is procured ; for a child the 
dose must be lessened according to the age. 



POISON OAK. 



POISON OAK. (Domestic.) Its antidode. A salve made of equal 
parts of butter, salt and saleratus; it is a sure and speedy cure. If 
a person expects to be exposed to its poison, he should take a box 
of this salve with him and slightly anoint the hands and face. This 
will often prevent the poison from taking effect. 

CURE FOR CALIFORNIA POISON OAK. Dr. S. A. Brown, U. S. N. 
From 10 to 20 drops of bromine to i oz. of olive oil, casmoline or 
glycerine, mix well together, then apply by gently rubbing the effect- 
ed part 2 or 3 times a day, especially on going to bed at night, and 
a cure will be effected in 24 hours. The application of glycerine is 
painful, and posesses no advantage over the olive oil. NOTE. The 



568 HEALTH NOTES. 

bromine is so volatile that the solution should be renewed within 24 
hours after its preparation. N. B. This should be welcome news 
to campers out and picknickers generally. 

SWEET OIL AN ANTIDOTE FOR POISON OF ANY KIND. Every house- 
keeper should keep a bottle of it; no one should hunt in woods where 
there is a probability of meeting with poisonous reptiles, without a 
supply of it. The patient must take a spoonful immediately and 
bathe the wound for a cure. To cure a horse, requires 8 times as 
much as for a man. It is good for even extreme cases of snake 
bite, even those of long standing. It will cure bloat in cattle, caused 
by eating too freely of green herbage, (grass or clover), stings of 
bees, spiders, or other insects. The poison of ivy and other poison- 
ous herbage. 

SALVES OF VARIOUS KINDS. 

ELDER BARK SALVE FOR SORE EYELIDS. Remove the outer and 
take the inner bark of elder, stew in lard. Apply the salf e to sore 
eyelids. 

PLANTAIN, good, combined with lard, for salt rheum. Its juice 
will cure the bite of snakes. It should be beaten. 

SALVE FOR ALL SCROFFULOUS SORES, ETC. Mrs. J. A. Stephenson, 
Arizona. To a teacupful of lard, free from salt, add and mix thor- 
oughly, sulphate of zinc or white precipitate, about the size of a 
bean. 

LINIMENTS. 
A VALUABLE LlNIMENT FOR SPRAINS, BRUISES AND BURNS. Equal 

parts of spirits ammonia and petroleum. 

RHEUMATISM LINIMENT. Steep for 10 days 4 tablespoonfuls of 
cayenne pepper in 6 gills of whiskey and a gill of neat-foot oil or 
lard, then strain it. Wet a flannel with it and apply it to the joints, 
and to the side for pleurisy, or any numbness. It will afford relief. 

BLUE FLAG. This grows in gardens, but particularly in swampy 
places, by the banks of streams of water and in meadows. Its flow- 
ers are blue, variegated with yellow, white and purple. It is an 
excellent and active cathartic, given in doses of a teaspoonful of the 
juice, diluted in a little water. If a decoction of it is drank constant- 
ly, it is good in all kinds of ulcerous complaints. 

DECOCTION OF POPPIES Poppy heads, sliced, 4 ozs.; 4 pints wa- 
ter; boil 1-4 hour and strain. This decoction is employed for its 
soothing effects in painful swelling and excoriations, etc. Its effi- 
cacy is increased by adding a cupful of vinegar. 



HEALTH NOTES. 



FELON. Common rock salt, mix with equal parts of turpentine, 
apply ; when dry, more ; it will cure in 24 hours.

A SIMPLE CURE FOR A FELON. When the part begins to swell, 
wrap a cloth around it and then saturate it and keep it wet with the 
tincture of lobelia. If applied in time, it rarely fails to cure. 

SALVE FOR A FELON. A salve may be made by burning a table- 
spoonful of copperas, then pulverize it and mix it with the yolks of 
eggs. It will relieve the pain and cure the felon in 24 hours. Then

in warm water, and then daily apply the healing salve. 

RUSSIAN SALVE. Equal parts of yellow wax and sweet oil ; melt 
slowly and carefully stirring, when cooling, stir in a little glycerine. 
Good for sore lips and all kinds of wounds and sores. 

FELON is a rising caused by a wound, deep enough to reach the 
bone and inflame it; a boil between the bone and sinew, and the 
quickest and surest way is to lance it to the bone. It will give in- 
stant relief, as the extraction of a tooth will relieve tooth ache. 

BONE FELON ARRESTED BY CONGELATION. Dr. James B. Walker, 
St. Louis, Mo., says, in the Medical Archives, that holding the finger 
affected 2 hours in a freezing mixture, alternating the application, 
the felon will cease to be painful, or cease to be felt. 

TREATMENT OF WHITLOW. Steam the hands in bitter herbs for 30 
or 40 minutes, bathe it frequently in strong hot lye-water, as long as 
it can be borne, apply a poultice of flaxseed and slippery elm, with 
a little brandy ; a yeast poultice, or one of powderd hops, which is 
very effective to relieve pain, gentle apperients, tonics and nutitious 

food. 

GOITRE, OR ENLARGED NECK. Iodide of potassium, 2 drachms; 
iodine, i drachm ; water, 2 1-2 ozs., mix and shake for a few min- 
utes and pour into a bottle or vial for internal use. Dose: 5 to 10 
drops before each meal, taken in a little water. Then with a feather 
wet the goitre from another bottle of the same mixture night and 
morning until relieved. 

CURE FOR BOILS. Mix a little beer with brewers yeast and take 
it 3 times a day ; it will cause the boils to disappear. 

SIMPLE CURE FOR BOILS. Wet the pimple or boil, especially in 
the middle, with sweet oil and camphor. Apply with the end of the 
finger.

dilute with water and sweaten with clear honey. Use at pleasure 
2 or 4 times a day. 

WATERMELONS, SEEDS AND ROOTS. This melon is nourishing, 
cooling, and diuretic, when fully ripe and not stale. The seeds 
make a good vermifuge, and tea in gravel; the pulp of the root is 
cathartic. 

GRAVEL OR STRANGURY. i spoonful of honey, i spoonful of oat 
meal. Pour to them a quart of boiling water; stirring the mixture

day. 

CURE FOR KIDNEY AFFECTIONS.. "Aunt Betsey," colored. Get 
your druggist to mix in the proper proportion, sweet spirits of niter, 
spirits of turpentine and balsam of copaiva. If the patient can 
stand it, give three drops of the mixture .before breakfast and four 
before lunch; if delicate, give one drop less. 

PEACH LEAVES \ND THE KIDNEYS. A tea made of fresh leaves is 
a grand remedy for a kidney difficulty. 

THE SMART WEED is very valuable in kidney diseases. Make 
a strong decoction of the weed with a white flower and drink it cold 
until relieved. It is a pleasant and valuable remedy. 

URINATING IN BED. German. To prevent. Boil well together 
making a strong decoction of the inside bark of white oak, juniper 
berries and onions. Remove from the fire, pour the contents into a 
wooden vessel not too long, then camomile flowers, thyme, and 
mullein flowers, so as to make it strong. Place the vessel under a 
seat, place yourself over it, then put a hot stone in it, then pin 
the clothes close, wrap yourself up, so as to steam yourself well. 
Be careful not to get cold too suddenly. Get in bed and cover up 
well with a hot brick or stone at your feet. Drink a cupful of 
mullein tea as hot as you can. Repeat this several nights in suc- 
cession. Do not expose yourself to drafts, nor take cold. 

LINIMENT FOR WHITE SWELLING AND PALSY. Boil to a strong

and rheumatic pains, glandular enlargements, ei.c. 

MEXICAN MUSTANG LINIMENT. Mix 2 fluid oz. petroleum, i 
fluid oz. ammonia water, and i fluid dram of brandy. 

MAGIC LINIMENT Alcohol, i quart; gum camphor, 4 oz. For 
cuts or calks in horses or cattle (in winter) it has no equal; but it 
must be applied often. For human flesh use twice the amount 
alcohol, and no liniment will be found superior to it. 

AN EXCELLENT LINIMENT is prepared by mixing 6 oz. of spirits o: 
wine and 2 oz. of spirits ammonia and 2 drams of lavender. 

LOTION OF ARNICA FOR BRUISES, SPRAINS, BURNS, &c. Take i 
ounce of arnica flowers dried, and put them in a wide mouthed 
bottle, pour over just enough scalding water to moisten them, art 
wards about i or 1-2 pints spirits of wine. In case of a burn or 
bruise,- etc., wet a cloth in the arnica and lay it on the part effected. 
Renew this occasionally, and the pain will be removed. 

OINTMENTS. 

TRASK'S OINMENT. Equal parts of resin, lard; and tobacco; steep 
the tobacco to get the strength of it. A little brown sugar and 

castile soap. ,. 

BROWN OINTMENT. i drachm extract of henbane, 1-2 oz. yellow

briskly without ceasing until cold. A good lip salve ; sore nipples ; 
for the face and hands. 



DISINFECTANTS. 

A VALUABLE DISINFECTANT. Put into a stone jar a handful each 
of worm -wood, lavender, mint, sage and rosemary, and pour on 
them a gallon of the best cider vinegar. Set it in a warm place and 
let it stand for 8 days, then strain it off and to every pint put 3-4 oz. 
of spirits of wine and camphor. Rub the temples and loins with 
this preparation, when exposed to contagion, before going out in the 
morning; wash the mouth with it, snuff some up the nostrils and 
carry a small sponge dipped in it to smell occasionally, on visiting 
where there is any danger of infection. To those who are not op- 
posed to the odor, garlic and assafoetida may be added. 

PINE TAR A VALUABLE DISINFECTANT. Pine tar is not only a val- 
uable, powerful disinfectant, but most healthful for man and beast. 
To use it for man or horses, take a kettle with wood coals and cover 
the same with the parings of horses' hoofs, or the horns of cattle 
broken up ; when burning well, pour a little pine tar over the whole 
and carry the kettle through the^different rooms, or set it where you 
choose. 

ONIONS AS A DISINFECTANT. Onions placed in the room where 
there is small pox, will blister and decompose rapidly ; besides this, 
they will prevent the spread of the disease. As a disinfectant they 
have no equal, when properly used; but keep them out of the 
stomach, no one should eat onions that attends or is about small pox 
patients. 

PURE AIR is the best disinfectant. 

To DESTROY the odor of carbolic acid on the hands, rub them with 
flaxseed meal.a little dampened. Ground mustard and water will 
also deodorize it. Cod liver oil bottles may be purified in the same 
way. 

THE SICK ROOM. 

THE sun's rays should penetrate every part of a house as nearly 
as possible, by opening the windows, especially the bedrooms. If 
there is no sunshine, let the breeze penetrate and cleanse away the 
stagnant air. 

FLOWERS and herbs should be excluded from a bed or sick room. 

ATMOSPHERE OF A SICK ROOM. Slice onions in saucers and set 
them in the room and they will absorb all the bad air. Renew them 
often and keep the air pure. 



HEALTH NOTES. 573 

THE bed room shonld be a sanctuary of cleanliness and order, in 
which no injurious exhalations can remain for a moment, an. 
trace of uncleanliness offend a single sense. 

To PURIFY a sick room of smells, use bromo chlora urn in the prc 
portion of r tablespoonful to 8 of water; dip cloths in t ^prepara- 
tion and hang them in the room. A weak solution of this w> U purrty 
any surface by applying it after the article has been "*; 
It is excellent for wounds and sores that are offensive, and will pui 
fy the breath by rinsing the mouth with it. 

LEUCORRHEA. 

INJECTION FOR LEUCORRHEA OR WHITES. Inner bark of spotted 
alder' alder bSc and leaves. Inject tea twice a day with a proper 



^SEDY FOR WniTES.-Injection of green tea, 4 or 5 grains of 
sugar of lead in a wine glass of soft or ram water, given as an u

pint of water till reduced to 1-2, strain and drink hot after 
bed and cover up closely. Repeat 2 or 3 nights. 

PANFUL MKNSTRUATiON.-Ten drops of laudanum

Fi MALI IlKGULAfiNG PILLS. Aloes, red oxide of iron, white tur- 
pentine, each i oz. each, melt the turpentine and strain; mix well 
form it into pills with mucilage, and take 2 or 3 per day. 

PILES. 

FOR PILES. Jamestown weed leaves (vulgar jimson) bruised and 
stewed in lard to a salve. Excellent. Apply the ointment. 

OINTMENT FOR PILES Four ounces hog's lard, 2 drachms cam- 
phor, powdered; i ounce galls, 1-2 ounce laudanum; mix. Make 
an ointment to be applied every night at bed time. 

PILES, A SAILOR'S REMEDY. Take the pitched rope and pick it 
into lint, put on a cloth and wear it under the afflicted part. The 
cloth may be pasted on the under garment. The tar will cure in a 
few days. 

GOLDEN SALVE. Two quarts of raw linseed oil, 3 Ibs. of good 
fresh resin, 3 pounds of beesewax ; melt thoroughly together and 
turn it into tin boxes. This is the best known salve for burns, scalds, 
flesh wounds, old sores, piles, &c. 

N. B. Smaller quantities may be made, using the same propor- 
tions. 

CANCERS AND OTHER SORES. 

CANCER. Dr. Motherly. One handful of crow's foot, 3 good 
sprigs in flower of may weed (dog fennel) well pounded, then add 
7 teaspoonfuls each of pure flowers of sulphur and white dry ar- 
senic ; mix well together, bottle perfectly air-tight. When used, mix 
with the yolk of an egg, make a plaster as large as the sore, being 
careful that it does not get in the eye or mouth or nose. Let it come 
off of itself. 

A NEW CAUSE OF CANCER. The physicians of New York report 
an alarming increase of cancer on the nose, caused by the practice 
of wearing eye glasses that are held to the bridge of the nose by a 
spring. 

AN AMERICAN'S METHOD. The Americans boil olive oil to a pro- 
per consistency, then make a salve of it. It is said by the travel- 
ers to be a good remedy. 

FOR CANCER. Mrs. Kellogg. If the cancer is not very much 
advanced, apply a poultice made of yolk of eggs and salt well stir- 
red together. It is very soothing, and should be applied until the 
core comes out. 

N. B. This does not apply to rose cancer. 

ANOTHER, OF THE JUICE OF SHEEP SORREL. Mrs. Kellogg. 
Beat the juice of sheep sorrel, a large handful or more, then squeeze

the juice through a thin rag into a plate or saucer and let the water 
evaporate, then while soft spread the thick juice or gum on a cloth 
the size of the cancer, which plaster will take out the core with the 
roots, but if the plaster is not large enough there will be a dark edge 
around the place from which the core was taken ; then apply an- 
other larger one. ^ 

THE NURSERY. 

COLIC IN BABIES. Give a drop or two of the essence of anise-seed 
in a little warm water. 

DR. GODFRY'S CORDIAL FOR BABIES. One pint of black molasses, 
I pint of water, 2 oz. best laudanum, 2 oz. best alcohol, 2 oz. salt of 
tartar, 10 drops oil of sassafras ; shake these ingredients well together 
and bottle for use. Good for colic, gripings and looseness of the 
bowels ; it is good also for grown up persons. For babies, 1-2 tea- 
spoonful in the morning, and the same at night when put to bed, or 
just before you put them to sleep, whatever hour that may be. A 
baby 2 months old can take i teaspoonful. If the bowels are bad, it 
can be taken several times a day with the happiest effect. For an 
adult i teaspoonful is a dose. 

BREAD AND BUTTER, AND MILK Are the only two articles oft 
Which have all the elements of nutrition. Hence from childhood to 
extreme old age, we are never tired of them. 

CHICKEN PANADA FOR BABIES AND INVALIDS. Take a youug 
fowl and roast it well, then take away the white meat and chop it, 
and pound it to a pulp with the crumbs of a French roll, satur- 
ated with the broth, then weaken this, with a little chicken water 
made from the bones of the roasted fowl, till it forms a batter like 
cream; strain it as other soup, add a small pinch of salt, use no 
spices, herbs, or vegetables. 

SAGO AND FLOUI!. Dr. Motherly. Sago is better thai wheaten 
flour for impaired or sick people, because it does not ferment in 
the stomach. 

FOR A CHILD'S LUNCH. Good sweet butter with stale bread, is 
one of the most nutricious, at the same time the most wholesome 
articles of food that can be given to children after they are weaned. 
BABY'S FOOD. Dr. Meigs. One teacupful of Cox gelatine, dis- 
solved in a tumbler of cold water; let it stand one-half hour before 
usin" take two pints of boiling water, pour in the gelatine. Put it in 
a saucepan, and let it come to a boil, then add three breakfast tea- 
spoonfuls of Duryea's corn starch, dissolved in a pint of new rich 
cream in which a pinch of salt and three teaspoonfuls of sugar have 
been dissolved. The corn starch must be mixed up a little at a

time as common starch is, or it will be lumpy. All the time the 
preparation is being boiled, it must be stired to keep it from burn- 
ing. As the child becomes older, the quantity of milk and water 
must be reversed, that is, one pint of water instead of two pints of 
water, and two pints of milk instead of one of milk. 

CARE OF CHILDREN. The best cordial for children is proper food; 
the finest syrup is through cleanliness, and the most efficacious of 
all "soothing" medicines is good management, with a due propor- 
tion of sleep. 

CHILDREN, when going to sleep, should have a light, if they wish 
it. It is a mistaken kindness to force them to go to sleep in the 
dark. 

PREMONITION OF SICKNESS IN CHILDREN. If a child wakes up in 
the morning and calls for a drink of water the first thing, such child 
is perfectly certain to be sick before noon. The course to be pur- 
sued is to keep him in bed, and by warm drinks promote perspira- 
tion, eating nothing whatever until the afternoon, when he may be 
amused by giving him some cold, dry bread to nibble, and the next 
day he will be about again. Otherwise a breakfast will be eaten, 
fever comes on, and vomiting and several days' illness. 

CHOLERA INFANTUJ*. Give an enema at once of warm. but not 
too hot water. It is at the fundament the disease begins. Keep the 
patient warm. 

FOR BABIES WITH DIARRHEA. One teaspoonful of parched wheat 
flour boiled in a cup of milk. 

CURB FOR EAR-ACHE. Children are sometimes afflicted with ear- 
ache to an alarming extent, and there is sometimes a difficulty in 
obtaining an effectual remedy for this disorder. Take a piece or 
salt pork or fat bacon, say an inch or more long and 1-2 inch square, 
cut down one end to fit the ear and insert it, taking care to have the 
piece too large to slip in. Tie a handkerchief to keep it in 
place, if the child will allow it. 

RISING OR PAINFUL GATHERING IN THE EAR. Apply warm a few 
drops of castor oil in the ear dropped from a spoon, then saturate a 
piece of cotton wool and close the ear. The oil is very healing to 
running ears. Of its beneficial effects I speak from what I have 
seen. 

HIVES OR NETTLE RASH. Rub the places over with flour; grease 
and drink sassafras or Santa Yerba tea, or give a mixture of three- 
fourths cream of tartar and one-fourth of sulphur mixed with milk, 
water or molasses. 

SEA HOLLY OR "Err WEED." Much used in decoction in the 
West Indies for hysterics. 

SCURF IN THE HEAD. Dr. Chase. Wet the roots of the hair

with a mixture of lime water, not strong, and some fine fruit vine- 
gar. 

POWDER, VIOLET, FOR CHILDREN, DURING EXCORIATIONS. 
Powdered starch, 28 pounds ; powdered orris root, i pound ; essence 
of bergamot, 1-4 ounce ; oil of rhodium, 1-2 drachm. Mix and 
press through a sieve. 

FOR BABIES WHILE TEETHING. Tea of the milk (male) purslain 
while teething or suffering from bowel complaint. Add a few leaves 
of horse mint ; put sugar and new milk enough to make it palata- 
ble. 

TEETHING CHILDREN. A recipe for. One pound of honey, two 
tablespoonfuls each of paragoric and oil of aniseseed ; add enough 
of either to make a thick syrup ; bottle closely. For children. A 
dose of a teaspoonful now and then. 

SORE MOUTH AND TRUSH. With the handle of a spoon put on 
the tongue, or with a cloth wound around the fore finger dipped in 
equal portions of loaf sugar and borax mixed together, and rub the 
gums, roof of the mouth and tongue with it. 

NOTE Tea made of sumach berries is also excellent. Touch the 
mouth with the finger as with the powdered mixture. 

VACCINATION in infancy is an almost perfect safeguard until the 
fourteenth year. Let every youth be re-vaccinated on entering 
fourteen. Let several attempts be made, so as to be certain of 
safety. 

CURE FOR CROUP M. Gourd, N. O. i teaspoonful of Carracas 
indigo" to a wine glassful of water; add sugar enough to make a 
syrup. Administer one teaspoonful every half hour; if necessary, 
one every fifteen ^minutes, as circumstances may require. This 
remedy has been used by the most eminent physicians in N. O. for 
the most obstinate cases of croup, and whenever tried proved in- 
fallible. 

CROUP. Mix i teasponful of powdered alum with 2 teaspoonfuls 
of sugar. Give immediately. It gives instant relief; 

CROUP, TO PREVENT IN CHILDREN. Cut a chamois skin to fit the 
neck of the child, then sew some tape on it to fasten it by, then melt 
some mutton tallow and pine tar, and rub the mixture or some of 
it on the skin, and let the child wear it all the time, painting the skin 
with the mixture when it begins to wear off. 

SIMPLE CURE FOR CROUP. Journal of Heath. The moment a 
child is taken with croup, apply cold or ice water, suddenly and 
freely to the neck and chest with a sponge. The breathing will be 
almost instantly relieved and let the patient drink as much as it 
possibly caa Then wipe dry and cover up, and a sweet sleep will 
follow. 



578 THE NURSERY. 

CURE FOR CROUP. In places where a physician cannot be had 
immediately, it is best to keep on hand alum pulverized as fine as 
flour (a sure remedy). In case of croup, mix the pulverized alum 
with syrup or molasses, and give a small teacupful. Repeat it every 
two or three minutes until vomiting is produced, when the trouble 
will be over. 

MEMBRANOUS CROUP. i teaspoonful each of sulphur and molas- 
ses mixed together. Give promptly. After vomiting repeat the 
quantity. 

TAPE WORM. German, Mrs. Norwold. Take the pumpkin seed 
from a large pumpkin just opened, before they dry at all, then beat 
them in a mortar fine, then squeeze the juice from them through a 
rag, then take of this juice a large tablespoonful with a little clear 
honey, mixed well, before breakfast for two days, taking sparingly 
of food, drinking slippery elm tea cold. The third day take a mild 
apperient, a teaspoonful of cream of tartar, 3 of Bass' pills, drink- 
ing the slippery elm tea water. If this removes only a part of the 
worm, continue to take the pumpkin seed juice, and the elm tea. 
Not drinking it the third day; when you take the purge for a week or 
ten days, the head and all will come away, for this worm ex- 
tends from the stomach through the entire length of the bowels, like 
a jointed snake. If only the joints come away without the head, it 
will grow again. Note. Always take the juice before breakfast on 
an empty stomach. If you cannot get the elm, take the pumpkin 
juice with a little honey. 

DOMESTIC HOME CONFECTION. Make a strong decoction of sage 
leaves, worm seed or leaves. Strain and add sugar or molasses 
and boil to a syrup, or candy till it granulates. Children like it. I 
know it to be a valuable remedy. 

REMEDY FOB WORMS. Dissolve in a two ounce vial filled with 
water, a piece of copperas, of the size of a pea. Take for 3 or 4 
days, a teaspoonful of the mixture. Then rest 3 days. If not re- 
lieved, use it some days longer. A child under 2 years, give i-a 
the quantity. 

SALT AND WATER is an excellent enema for pin worms in 
children. 

SCARIES AND PIN WoRMg.-Mix together one-half pint of strong 
lye made from ashes of the white ash bark with i pint of warm 
water. Take 2 or 3 pints a day. 

BATHS FOR CHILDREN should always contain borax in the water. 

BABIES' WASHING. N. B. In doing this the first time after 
their birth, the nurse should be careful not to get any of the water in 
the eyes, as it will cause sore eyes, which may become chronic, and 
finally produce blindness, nor in the mouth, as that may cause it to 
beco me sore. 



THE LAUNDRY. 



ARABS bathe their children in salt and water. 

SORENESS OR CHAFE on any part of the body, powder pipe clay. 

FAILURE TO MAKE WATER.- Make a tea of beaten watermelon, 
pumpkin, or flax seed tea; give a little. 

GROIN HERNIA.- Keep the child lying down as much as possi- 
ble, and do not let it cry. If the rupture does not heal itself; apply a 
pitch plaster. If this fails call in a physician and have it made 
under the direction of an experienced physician. Note. Groin 
rupture can be cured if taken in season. Push in the protrud- 
ing bowel, and while lying down apply the plaster. 

CURE FOR DIARRHEA. Cut up a dozen green persimmons with i 
ounce of red wood bark ; boil these in a pint of water until reduced 
to 1-2, then add i ounce gum arabic and 1-2 pound of white sugar. 
Boil this mixture with a teaspoonful of syrup from blackberry pre- 
serves (if the preserves have not fermented), stew down to a stiff 
syrup, sift coarse white sugar in a clean sheet of white paper and 
drop the candy on it in the shape of lozenges. Let the patient eat 
3 or 4 a day. Drink gum arabic water and toast water. 

CHOLERA MEDICINES. When the premonitory symptom is diar- 
rhea, use as recommended. Chalk mixture, i ounce, 10 or 15 grains 
aromatic confection, 3 to 15 drops tincture of opium. To be re- 
peated every 3 or 4 hours, or oftener, if the attack be severe, until 
the looseness is stopped. 

THE LAUNDRY. 

AN EXCELLENT WASHING FLUID. Three tablespoonfuls each of 
soda and spirits of camphor to 2 pints of salt water put into a bot- 
tle and before using shake it well; to 3 cups of soft soap add 4 
tablespoonfuls of the mixture, make suds of warm water and the 
fluid, soak the clothes in it for 30 minutes, then with the same quan- 
tity of fluid and soap make another suds, and boil the clothes in il 
for 1-4 hour, then rinse them in 2 waters. 

WASHING FLUID. One-half pint of spirits of turpentine, 1-4 ID. 
of sal soda in water, 1-2 gallon of soft soap ; make i gallon of fluid; 
1-2 pint makes enough for one washing. 

BELGIUM WASHING FLUID. In Holland they use 1-2 pound of 
powdered borax in 10 gallons water; very little soap is needed. 
Borax water should be on every toilet stand. 

FIG LEAF TEA, TO STIFFEN BLACK. CALICOES. After washing th< 
article through 3 warm waters, rinse it in the fig-leaf tea ; when 
nearly dry, fold, let it remain an hour and iron immediately. 
gall sets dark color* well. One tablespoonful to a gallon ot water. 



580 THE LAUNDRY. 

To MAKE STARCH. Allow 1-2 pint of cold water and i quart of 
boiling water to every 2 tablespoonfuls of starch. Put the starch 
into a tolerably large basin, pour over it the cold water, and stir the 
mixture well with a clean wooden spoon until it is perfectly free 
from lumps and quite smooth ; then take the basin to the stove or 
fire, and whilst the water is actually boiling in the kettle or boiler, 
pouring it over the starch, stirring it all the time. If properly made 
in this manner, the starch will require no further boiling, but 
should the water not be boiling when added to thicken the starch, 
it will not thicken, and must be put in a clean sauce pan and 
stirred over the fire until it does boil. Take it off the fire, strain 
it through a clean cloth into a basin, cover it to prevent a skin 
from forming on the top, and when sufficiently cool that the hand 
may be borne in it, starch the things. Many persons, to give a 
shiny, glossy appearance to the linen when ironed, stir around 
while hot 2 or 3 times a wax or sperm candle, let the clothes remain 
for 3 or 4 hours, when they are ready to iron. 

COLD STJLRCH. Mix up the starch tolerably thick in a bowl of 
cold water, then dip in the parts of linen, as the collar, wristbands, 
cuffs, front shirts into the cold paste, then squeeze them up tightly 
in a clean, dry cloth and let them remain i hour, then have your 
irons ready, hot and perfectly clean; then put a thin, clean cloth 
over them and iron them. It is a good way. When the "things 
to be starched" are washed, dried and taken off the lines, they 
should be dipped into the hot starch and squeezed out of it, and 
then dipped into cold water, and immediately squeezed dry in a 
clean, dry cloth. 

FOR CLEAR STARCHING. From a German laundress. Mix up the 
starch with cold water, then pour hot water into it, then have some 
rather warm water in a separate bowl, then dip the articles into the 
clear starch, then into the warm water, then squeeze them out after 
rinsing them thoroughly, then dip into the warm water only your 
lawn neck ties, and squeeze them out, and then wrap them up a 
moment, and iron them. The second water prevents the iron from 
sticking, and makes the article more glossy. 

NOTE When the warm water in the bowl becomes thick, pour it 
out, and add more that is fresh. 

To IMPROVE STARCH. To each bowl of starch add i teaspoon- 
ful of epsom salts. Articles are rendered stiffer and somewhat fire- 
proof by it. 

STARCH POLISH. One-third white wax, 2-3 spermacetti ; melt to- 
gether slowly, pour into a mould ; use a piece as large as a bean, 
if the washing is small. 



THE LAUNDRY. * 581 

To MAKE SHIRT BOSOMS GLOSSY. Dissolve 3 ounces of gum 
arabic, clean, powdered and white, in i pint of water ; when dis- 
solved thoroughly, strain it shrough a piece of muslin, or cotton 
cloth, and bottle for use. One spoonful of this gum water added to 
a pint of starch will give a beautiful smooth gloss to cotton or linen 
fabrics. 

FOR WASHING AND BLEACHING LACES. Put one teaspoonful of 
borax to i pint of boiling water, leave your articles in soak in the 
solution for 2 hours, then wash with a little soap. 

To CLEAN THREAD LACE. When the thread lace has been tack- 
ed to a bottle, take the best sweet oil and saturate the lace thorough- 
ly. Have ready in a wash kettle a strong, cold lather of clear soap 
and water, immerse the bottle in it, and boil it for more than one hour, 
till the lace is clear and white through. Drain out of the suds and 
dry'it on the bottle in the sun. Then take it off, and lay it in long 
folds between sheets of white paper in a heavy book. 

SILKS, when washed, should be dried in the shade on a line or 
linen horse, taking care that they are kept smooth and unwrinkled. 

To CLEAN SILK RIBBONS. One-half pint of gin, 1-2 Ib. of clear 
honey, 1-2 Ib. of soft soap, 1-2 pint of salt water; mix the above in- 
gredients together, then lay each breadth of silk upon a clean table 
or dresser, and scrub it well on the soiled side with the mixture. 

SILK handkerchiefs should be washed alone, soaked an hour or 
two in cold water and soaped as they are washed, then rinsed in soft 
water, in which a handful of common salt has been dissolved. 

To PREVENT SILK HANDKERCHIEFS LOSING THEIR COLOR. Dip 
them, or any other colored silk article, into salt and water before they 
are washed, which will preserve the color, (a small handful of com- 
mon salt in a wash-basin of water.) 

BLACK SILK DRESSES, if very dirty, must be washed, but if not 
soiled, soaking for 24 hours will do; if old and musty, a pint of com- 
mon spirits should be mixed with each gallon of water, which is an 
improvement under any circumstances. Brewers beer is good, 
whether soaked or washed ; it should be hung up to drain, and dried 
without wringing. 

FLAT IRONS, when rrot in use, should be kept in a perfectly dry 
place. They should never be allowed to stand on the range after 
the ironing. The bottoms of them should be thoroughly clean and 
polished smooth. 



PERPETUAL ALMANAC.
