A FRENCH RECIPE. 
Chicken en Casserole. 

Take a tender broiling chicken, wash dry, and cut into four 
pieces. Put into an earthen casserole with a generous piece 
of butter on each. Put on the cover and stand the dish in a 
hot oven for an houi. Have ready as many potatoes as will 
be needed scooped into little balls with vegetable cutter. Fry 
them a golden brown, in deep fat. Make a mixture of chopped 
chives, salt, chopped parsley, red and black pepper, and a 
tablespoon of Kitchen Bouquet. A few minutes before serv- 
ing remove the chicken from the casserole and turn in the 
potatoes, the seasoning mixture, and a wine glass of Sauterne 
Madeira or Sherry. Stir thoroughly, return the chicken, baste 
it thoroughly with this gravy, and cook it 5 minutes to reheat. 
Serve it in the casserole.

chops, or any of the cheaper parts (as the shoulder). 
2 onions. 6 potatoes. 



2 tablespoonfuls butter. Yi tablespoon salt. 

2 tablespoonfuls flour. Ys, teaspoon pepper. â€¢ 

6 white turnips. i qt. of water. 

Free the mutton from fat and skin. Put the butter in a stew 
pan over a hot fire. When butter is hot add the mutton and 
cook until it is brown on all sides. Now take the meat from 
the pan, add the flour, stirring well until it is browned, then 
add the water, stirring constantly. When this sauce boils add 
the mutton, salt, pepper and the onions cut in slices. Cover 
the pan and simmer contents slowly for tw^o hours. At the 
end of this time add the turnips, cut in cubes, stirring the mix- 
ture well. Spread the cubes of potatoes on top, cover the stew 
pan and cook a trifle more rapidly. It will require ^ of an 
hour longer to finish the ragout. The French often employ 
veal or pork instead of mutton. The thing we cannot change 
is the method of cooking, ^vhich is always done slowly. 



Baked Brains. 

Soak for i hour in cold, salted water, changing the water 
several times. Parboil for 15 minutes. Plunge into ice water 
to blanch and remove all membrane.

juice, and lastly, the beaten whites cut and folded in. Put 
paper in bottom of tin, and butter it, and the sides of the tin.

enough below the joint to tic to the tail. Wash and wipe. 
Cover with vinegar spiced and flavored with onion and let 
them stand several hours. This makes them tender. Drain

making it stiff enough to roll into balls. Stuff the pigeons 
with these. Dredge with salt, pepper and flour. Fry 5 or 6 
slices of salt pork, cut i large onion fine and fry it, in the fat. 
a light brown. Put the crisp pork in a stew pan, add the fried 
onion, then brown the pigeons all over, in the fat left in the 
pan. Put them in the stew pan on top the pork and onion, 
half cover with hot water, add a little pepper, salt, and a pinch 
of herbs tied in a cloth. Simmer very gently three hours. 
Remove the fat from the broth and thicken with flour and 
butter creamed together and diluted with a little of the broth.

in the mould, then pour in the remainder of the stock, and 
place in refrigerator to become hard. When about to serve 
remove from the mould and cut in thin slices with a sharp

white (veal), the outside pale yellow, or green jelly. Garnish 
with pink radishes, a little parsley, and slices of lemon.

cold. 



Grape Fruit Marmalade. 

Five medium-sized grape fruits, 12 lbs. sugar, 12 pts. of 
water. Slice the fruit very thin. Put them into a kettle with 
II pts. of the water. Cover the seeds with the other pint of 
water. Let all stand 24 hours. Squeeze water from seeds, and 
add it to the fruit. Add juice of 3 oranges and 3 lemons. Boil 
13^ hc^urs, keeping kettle covered. Add sugar and boil 30 min- 
utes. 



Cucamber Preserves. 

Take young cucumbers, a little longer than your middle 
finger, allowing i pt. of salt for every hundred. Sprinkle in 
layers, pour on boiling water and let stand one week (with a 
weight to keep them under the brine). Wash the salt off, 
and soak i day and night in fair water, changing this 4 times. 
With a small knife slit down one side, dig out the seeds, stuff 
with a mixture of 2 cups of seeded chopped raisins, Yz, cup 
citron, chopped very fine, and ^ cup candied cherries, also 
chopped. Sew up incision with fine thread. Weigh them and 
make a syrup, allowing i lb. sugar to every one of cucumbers, 
with a pint of water. Heat to a sharp boil, skim, drop in tbe 
fruit, and simmer very slowly i hour. Take up the fruit and 
spread on a platter. Boil down the syrup with a little ginger 
root added. When thick put in the cucumbers again, simmer 
5 minutes to heat through, then put in glass jars, sealing when 
cold. An odd and delicious sweet pickle. (Cut in slices and lay 
them down flat.) 



Preserved Pumpkin. 

Cut, pare and remove the seeds, cut in squares, or slice on 
a potato cutter. Allow equal weight of sugar and pumpkin, 
arranging them in layers. Pour in lemon juice, Y^ cupful to 
each pound of pumpkin. Let stand 24 hours. Then boil all 
together with i cup of water to every 3 lbs. of pumpkin, 1 
tablespoon ginger root, tied in a cloth, and the thin yellow 
rind of the lemons shredded. Simmer until pumpkin is ten- 
der, then put in jars. In 3 or 4 days pour oft* the syrup, boil 
up and pour over hot. 



Tutti Frutti. 

Put into a 2-qt. jar i pt. of pure alcohol and i^ lbs. white 
sugar. Stir well. Add all kinds of fresh fruits as they, come 
into season, and as fruit is put in always add an equal amount 
of sugar (in addition to the first syrup). Use red currants, 
cherries, strawberries, red raspberries (very generously), 
peaches, candied or fresh kumquots, apples, pears, plums, pine- 
apple (sliced and then quartered), quinces (slightly cooked) â€” 
everything but blackberries, blueberries and muskmelon. These 
berries are too dark. 

A most delicious flavor is imparted to grape jelly by adding 
a twig of cherry tree, with 2 or 3 leaves, sewing it in a bag. 



A few peach leaves added to tomato catsup improve the 
flavor.
