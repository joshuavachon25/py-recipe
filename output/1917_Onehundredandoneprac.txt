PREFACE. 



Tly^F late positioii as Principal of the Eustace Miles 
J. fJ. School of Cookery for four years has resulted in 
numerous and ojt-repeated reqjiests fro7n pupils 
for a Non- Flesh Cookery Book — hence this publication. 

For nine years f?iy husband and I have been abstainers 
from flesh- foods. During this time we have devoted our 
attention to forming NEW combinations of these foods, with 
special reference to their nutritive value, digestibility, 
tastiness, and dainty dishing up. 

The measure oj success that has attended our ej^orts is 
shown by the fact that we have been awarded three gold, 
six silver, and four bronze medals, and numerous diplo- 
mas, for Non- Flesh Cookery, at the Food and Cookery 
Exhibitions at the Royal Horticultural Hall, by judges 
who are among the best chefs in the world. Also we have 
been, and are, catering for and pleasing thousands of a 
public, well known to be critical, at Blatch's Restaurant, 
50 CniirifiH Sireef,'JS.'C.'^ and dl'seiojierc.^^"- • 

These fO'l Beit'J^Scipes,' in" ndditien 'to- msking tasty, 
nourishing and etenotniccl dishf^^ai:e particularly suited 
for use by those caiifei^ijtlating a c'ka\i^^ of diet.

Marmite ( which I have always found an excellent flavour- 
ing eleffientj and Nutter Suet (which is quite free from 
water). 

I have endeavoured to word my Recipes as dearly and 
simply as possible, in the hope that the a7?iateur cook, as 
well as the professional, will be able to work from the7n 
without difficulty. As a rule the recipes in this book are 
intended to provide for four persons.

4 oz. milled or grated Brazils. 

2 oz. Butter or Nut Margarine. 
1 gill of Water or Milk.

frying is the best for cutlets, rissoles and

the blue vapour arises from the boiling fat before 
the cutlets are put in, or they will absorb the fat, 
which so often spoils this form of cooking.

the baking powder and the salt, make a bay and 
pour in the water, gradually mix to a stiff paste, 
lay aside for 15 minutes before using. 

For the centre of the pudding use an assort- 
ment of cooked vegetables, such as carrots, 
beans, lentils, turnips, tomatoes, mushrooms, 
&c., with diced up firm nutmeat (such as 
Recipes 12 and 18), or hard-boiled eggs. The 
assortment should be put into a basin and

(Recipe 89) J inch thick about the size of the

fancy border ; brush off the flour with a soft 
brush, and lightly brush with the yolk of an

22. Nutmeat and Vegetable Brawn. 

Ifigredients : 
1 pint of clear Vegetable Soup (Recipe 7). 
12 strands of Agar- Agar. 
8 oz. Nutmeat (Recipes 13 or 18). 
Any variety of diced Vegetables. 

Method : * 

Rinse out with cold water some fancy dariole 
moulds, line the bottom with some fancy cut 
cooked vegetables, next put a layer of thinly- 
sliced nutmeat, then a layer of vegetables, and 
alternate layers until the moulds are well 
packed. Boil the soup with the Agar-Agar 
gently for 10 to 15 minutes until the Agar- Agar 
is quite dissolved, then fill up the moulds with 
jelly and stand aside for an hour to set. 
Serve with a nice border of assorted green salad 
with halves ot tomatoes and fancy shapes of 
cooked beetroot. 

JVofe. — Agar -Agar is so strong only a very 
little is needed. The best way is to soak and 
wash a few strands, and when they are swollen 
out they are more easy to count. I find 12 
strands about 10 inches long will set a pint of 
jelly, cream, or custard.
