THE CONSERVATION OF 
FOOD ENERGY 



INTRODUCTORY 

Within the past year the United States has been 
rudely awakened from its dreams of plenty to be faced 
with the urgent problem of maintaining the food supply 
for itself and for its allies in the face of all the diffi- 
culties incident to a state of war. A National Food 
Administration has been created and entrusted with 
large powers to deal with all phases of the complex 
situation. Questions of the labor supply, marketing, 
price control and transportation are being dealt with 
in a large way, while nation-wide propaganda have 
been launched for an increased food production by the 
farmer and for greater economy on the part of the 
consumer. 

Crude Products Inedible. — But however bountiful 
the farmer's crops, in their crude state they are not 
human food. Some of them, like hay or the straw of 
his grain crops, can be utilized only indirectly by feed- 
ing them to live stock. Others, like wheat and com, 
while they can also be used as animal feeds, are com-

monly thought of as being directly available to man. 
This, however, is only partially true. While wheat 
may be fed to live stock, man does not eat wheat but 
wheat flour and a bushel (sixty pounds) of wheat yields 
only about forty-three and one-half pounds of white 
flour along with sixteen and one-half pounds of milling 
offals useful only as stock feed. 

Two Methods of Utilization. — Two alternatives, then, 
are open for the conversion of farm crops into human 
food: 

First, they may be fed directly to animals to produce 
beef, mutton, pork or milk. 

Second, such of them as admit of it may be subjected 
to various manufacturing processes — milling, starch 
and glucose manufacture, oil extraction, brewing, dis- 
tilling — ^by which a greater or less proportion of them 
is converted into forms acceptable for man's use, and 
the by-products of these operations may be utilized in 
the production of meat or milk. 

Their Relative Efficiency. — In any scheme of food 
conservation it is clearly of vital importance to know 
the relative efficiency of the various methods just indi- 
cated. How can we get the greatest human food value 
out of a bushel of wheat or of corn? Shall we feed it 
to live stock and if so, shall we use the beef steer, the 
mutton sheep, the hog or the dairy cow as the mechan- 
ism for converting it into edible products? Or shall 
we manufacture it into flour or table meal or use it 
as a source of starch or glucose or alcoholic beverages, 



INTRODUCTORY 9 

and feed only the residues of these processes to live 
stock, and if the latter alternative is adopted, to what 
kind of live stock can they best be fed? 

This publication is an attempt to contribute certain 
data toward the solution of this problem as regards 
some of the more important farm products. Sections 
I to XIII show in some detail the methods employed 
while Section XIV attempts to summarize the broader 
teachings of the inquiry. In addition to such published 
data as could be found the author is under obligation

THE MEASURE OF FOOD VALUES 

A beefsteak, a slice of bread and a glass of milk 
cannot well be compared directly as to their nutritive 
values. Before comparisons such as those indicated 
in the introduction can be made there must be some 
common standard by which to measure the food values 
of a great variety of diverse materials. As a prelim- 
inary to the choice of such a standard a brief considera- 
tion of the three main purposes which the food serves 
appears necessary. 

What Food Supplies. — First, food supplies building 
material for the growth of the various tissues and 
organs in the young animal and for their maintenance 
and repair in the mature one. In general these build- 
ing materials are of two kinds: the mineral substances, 
which are required for the bones and in less degree for 
all the organs, and the proteins out of which the muscles 
and other working parts of the body are built up. 

Second, it supplies energy for the various activities 
of the internal organs which are necessary to sustain 
life, and for the performance of work. The food is in 
a very real sense the fuel of the body, much as gaso- 
line is the fuel of the auto or aeroplane, supplying the 
power to drive it and incidentally yielding heat to 
keep it warm. 

11 



12 CONSERVATION OF FOOD ENERGY 

Third, all food contains minute amounts of substances 
called vitamines, of which there appear to be two 
groups, the fat-soluble and the water-soluble. These 
vitamines furnish no appreciable amounts of building 
material nor of energy but their presence is essential 
to the various operations of the bodily machinery, 
especially in growth. In a very crude way they may 
be said to be somewhat like the oil which neither serves 
as fuel nor repair material for the engine and yet is 
essential to its smooth running. 

Food Energy. — ^AU food is produced primarily from 
the constituents of the soil and the air by the higher 
(chlorophyl-bearing) plants. The motive power for 
the transformation is supplied by the sun's raj^s and 
the sun energy thus absorbed is stored up in the pro- 
teins, starches, fats and other ingredients of the plant. 
It may be estimated that a 50-bushel corn crop would 
contain in grain and fodder nearly ten thousand therms 
of energy per acre, sufficient, if it were all converted 
into heat, to raise the temperature of one hundred 
tons of water from the freezing to the boiling point or 
equal to more than fifteen thousand horse-power hours 
of work. It is this stored-up matter and energy in 
agricultural products on which both men and animals 
depend to supply their daily needs. 

Of these needs the principal one is that for energy. 
A man eats, or should eat, in order that he may work 
and work is simply the expenditure of energy. Along 
with energy his food also supplies the mineral matters 



THE MEASURE OF FOOD VALUES 13 

and proteins necessary to keep his body in repair and 
the vitamines required to ensure its normal functioning, 
but a large share of his food is of value simply as body 
fuel. 

Availability. — To answer the question raised in the 
introduction, therefore, how we can get the greatest 
human food value out of wheat, corn or other products, 
what we need to know primarily is how much of the 
energy stored up in them it is possible to render avail- 
able for running the human machine. While it is true 
that a due supply of mineral matter, proteins and 
vitamines in the food is equally essential, it is not, 
from the present point of view, equally important, 
since comparatively slight modifications in a diet sup- 
plying sufficient energy can ordinarily remedy defici- 
encies in this respect. For this reason modern studies 
of human dietaries give prominence to the energy re- 
lations and the problem here raised will be discussed 
on that basis, i. e., we shall consider how much energy 
in forms available for human nutrition can be obtained 
from agricultural products in the various ways indi- 
cated in the introduction. 

Other Factors. — It is true that the problem of food 
conservation or of rationing an army or a people is 
very far from being so simple a thing as merely sup- 
plying a certain number of calories of energy or grams 
of protein. Questions of palatability, of dietary habits, 
of market facilities, and of costs of fuel, labor, trans- 
portation and marketing, both in agricultural and 



14 CONSERVATION OF FOOD ENERGY 

manufacturing industries, all have to be considered. 
To illustrate, it is shown in subsequent pages that the 
energy of corn may be most completely utilized by 
milling it and using only the corn bran for stock feed, 
and that considerable energy is lost when corn is fed 
directly to animals. It does not follow, however, that 
we should ship corn meal to our European allies, even 
if spoiHng in transportation could be prevented, since 
neither their dietary habits nor their domestic economy 
render the general use of corn bread practicable. Neither 
does it necessarily follow that no corn should be fed 
to live stock, even were the supply less abundant than 
it is. The energy of grain is carried largely by the 
starchy materials (carbohydrates). Fats, however, are 
important constituents of a dietary, both as affecting 
its palatabihty and satisfying quality and also for 
another reason not so often appreciated. Fat is a 
much more concentrated fuel than carbohydrates. If 
the attempt were made to sustain a man doing severe 
physical work, for example, one of our soldiers at the 
front, on wheat bread alone it may be estimated that 
he would have to eat about three and three-fourths 
pounds, an almost impossible quantity. But if three- 
quarters of a pound daily of fat salt pork and two 
ounces of butter were furnished, this with the addition 
of only one pound of bread would fully supply the 
necessary protein and energy.^ Considerations of this 

^ It scarcely need be said that this is not suggested as a model 
ration. It is intended simply to illustrate one reason for the 
importance of a due amount of fat in the diet. 



THE MEASURE OF FOOD VALUES 15 

sort might fully justify the sacrifice of energy incident 
to the production of pork from corn for the sake of 
the smaller weight and bulk of the ration and the 
lessened tonnage required for its overseas transporta- 
tion, but this can be determined with certainty only 
when the extent of the sacrifice is known. 

The foregoing considerations serve to illustrate the 
way in which conclusions which might be drawn from 
energy data alone are subject to important modifica- 
tions in the actual administration of food control. 
Nevertheless, the ultimate object of all food control 
measures is the recovery of the greatest practicable 
amount of food value from the products of the soil 
and a fundamental requirement for intelligently com- 
bining all the diverse factors imder changing condi- 
tions is a quantitative knowledge of the efficiency of 
different methods of procedure in conserving the food 
supply. The studies of human and animal nutrition 
during the last twenty years afford data for an approxi- 
mate computation of this efficiency and the results for 
some of the more important farm crops are recorded 
in the following pages. 



II 

ENERGY IN HUMAN FOODS 

How Determined. — The recognized method of esti- 
mating the energy supplied in human foods consists in 
determining first, the amounts of protein, fat and carbo- 
hydrates contained in the material and second, the 
proportions of them which escape utilization when the 
material is eaten.^ For example, the average of a large 
number of analyses shows one hundred pounds of wheat 
flour to contain 11.4 pounds of protein, 1.0 pound of 
fat, and 75.1 pounds of carbohydrates, of which 85 per 
cent., 90 per cent, and 98 per cent, respectively are 
digestible when the flour is made into bread, so that 
one hundred pounds of wheat flour supply 9.7 pounds 
of protein, 0.9 pound of fat and 73.6 pounds of carbo- 
hydrates in available form. But each pound of diges- 
tible protein or carbohydrates has been shown to supply 
1.82 therms^ of available energy and one pound of di- 

^ While this method takes no account of the mineral ingre- 
dients nor of the vitamines it is, nevertheless, sufficiently accurate 
for practical purposes under ordinary conditions of diet. 

* For the present purpose a therm is to be looked upon simply 
as a unit of energy — the yard-stick used in measuring it. Tech- 
nically, it is defined as the energy equivalent to the heat required 
to raise the temperature of 1000 kilograms of water one degree 
centigrade or 3962 pounds of water one degree Fahrenheit. 

16 



ENERGY IN HUMAN FOODS 17 

gestible fat 4.04 therms, and it is thus easily computed 
that one hundred pounds of wheat flour supply 165 
therms of energy for man's use. Since fat and carbo- 
hydrates are simply carriers of energy the foregoing 
statements may be simplified by saying that 100 pounds 
of wheat supply 9.7 pounds of protein and 165 therms 
of energy.

THE EFFICIENCY OF THE ANIMAL 

Recovery of Energy. — In its relation to the conser- 
vation of the food supply, the animal is a transformer. 
The grazing steer converts the crude, inedible sub- 
stances of grass into flesh and fat; the stall-fed dairy 
cow manufactures from her hay, silage and grain the 
totally different product milk. 

Only a part, however, of the energy and protein 
contained in the feed of the animal is recovered in the 
meat, milk or other animal products secured. In 
order, then, to measure the contribution made by the 
steer or the cow to the conserv^ation of the food supply 
it is necessary to know its efficiency as a converter — 
that is, what proportion of the protein and energy 
given it in the various feeding stuffs is recovered in 
the meat or milk produced. 

As regards the recovery of energy, extensive investi- 
gations by rigid scientific methods, both abroad and 
in the United States, during the past two decades 
have yielded results which seem to the writer suf- 
ficiently well established to afford a foundation on 
which to base at least a first approximation to the 

18 



EFFICIENCY OF THE ANIMAL 19 

efficiency of the animal as a conserver of the food 
supply. As regards protein, the data are, unfortunately, 
far less satisfactory, while the actual recovery in prac- 
tice is dependent to a large extent on the proportion of 
protein in the ration. 

Net Energy Values. — The facts concerning energy 
are conveniently expressed in what have been called 
net energy values. For example, one hundred pounds 
of corn contain about 178 therms of energy. When 
this corn is fed to a steer, however, about 43 therms 
escape unused in the various excreta and about 50 
therms more are lost in the extra heat production 
which always follows the eating of feed. The remaining 
85 therms, equal to 47.75 per cent, of the entire 178 
therms, is the portion that is utilized and is the net 
energy of the corn. It may be used to support the vital 
activities of the animal or, if he is already receiving a 
ration sufficient for this purpose, it may be utilized for 
growth or fattening and be stored up in the increase 
which later serves as human food. Similarly, one 
hundred pounds of average timothy hay contain about 
43 therms of net energy and one hundred pounds of 
oat straw about 35 therms, that is, they contribute 
these amounts to the nutrition of cattle. Similar 
although less well established factors are also available 
regarding the utilization of feed by the milch cow, the 
sheep and the pig. The following are the net energy 
values of the farm products considered on subsequent 
pages.

Value of Forage. — When materials like pasturage, 
hay or straw are used to produce meat or milk it is 
apparent that they are indirectly contributing to the 
food supply to the extent of their net energy values 
and the same thing is true of the inedible by-products 
of the various manufacturing processes referred to in 
the introduction. Whatever animal products may be 
secured in this way are a direct addition to man's 
food supply. With grains and the like, on the other 
hand, a considerable part may be used directly as 
human food, leaving only the by-products to be used 
for animal production. The purpose of this discussion, 
as already explained, is to compare these two methods 
of utilization. 

^ Armsby: The Pennsylvania Experiment Station, Bulletin No. 
142, July, 1916. 



EFFICIENCY OF THE ANIMAL 21 

We must not, however, jump to the conclusion that 
this may be accomplished by a comparison of the 
energy values of the foregoing table with those of the 
one on p. 17; that because, for example, corn meal 
has an energy value of 165.5 therms for human con- 
sumption and corn one of 85.5 therms for cattle, half 
as much food value is utilized in the latter case as 
in the former. Aside from the fact that one hundred 
pounds of corn yield only about 85 pounds of table 
meal, two very important considerations have to be 
taken into the account, as is shown in the two follow- 
ing sections. 



IV 
FOOD VALUE OF INCREASE BY ANIMAL 

Not All Edible. — The first of the two considerations 
just mentioned is that not all the increase made by the 
growing or fattening animal is edible. Part of it is 
contained in the bones, which have practically no 
nutritive value. Still another portion is found in the 
hide, hair, hoofs, horns, etc., and still another in the 
entrails. The dressed carcass amounts to from 55 to 
65 per cent, of the live weight in cattle and sheep and 
75 to 85 per cent, in hogs and still contains the bones 
and more or less other waste. While, then, a steer 
may store up 85 therms of energy in his body (p. 19) 
as a result of eating one hundred pounds of corn, by 
no means all of this is available for human food. 
What proportion is so available will depend upon the 
ratio of dressed to live weight and upon the amount of 
waste in the dressed carcass. 

Cattle. — Thus, on the basis of analyses of the entire 
bodies of medium fat cattle by Lawes and Gilbert 
and by Jordan the body of a thousand-pound steer 
contains about 1392 therms of energy. Such cattle 
will dress about 58 per cent., i. e., a one thousand-pound 
animal yields about 580 pounds of carcass of which 
about 17^ per cent, or 101 pounds is inedible waste. 

22 



FOOD VALUE OF INCREASE BY ANIMAL 23 

The remaining 479 pounds of edible substance con- 
tain about 678 therms of energy. Finally, when the 
edible portions of the carcass are consumed there is a 
further loss of about 10>^ per cent, due to the fact 
that the meat is not wholly digestible, so that out of 
the total of 1392 therms of energy contained in the 
body of the steer only 606 therms, or 43>^ per cent, 
of the whole, is actually utilized for human nutrition. 

In a precisely similar although somewhat more com- 
plicated manner it may be computed that a pound of 
increase in live weight in a fairly mature fattening 
steer contains about 2.1 therms of energy of which 
about 1.11 therms, or 53 per cent., is available as food 
for man. The higher percentage arises from the fact 
that less inedible matter is produced in fattening than 
in growth. 

Sheep. — The sheep makes a somewhat better show- 
ing. On the average one pound of live weight of a 
medium fat sheep contains 1.517 therms of energy of 
which 0.747 therm, or 49.2 per cent., is available. 

Pigs. — The pig stands above either the steer or the 
sheep in this respect, partly because he stores up more 
energy in a pound of live weight but chiefly because of 
a much higher ratio of dressed to live weight, ranging 
from 75 to 85 per cent, as compared mth about 58 
per cent, for cattle and 60 per cent, for sheep. One 
pound of live weight of a medium hog may be estimated 
to contain 2.186 therms of total energy of which 1.975 
therms, or 90.4 per cent., is available to man. 



24 CONSERVATION OF FOOD ENERGY 

Dairy Cows. — Finally the list is headed by the dairy 
cow. A daily jdeld of twenty-five pounds of milk with 
4 per cent, of fat will contain about 8.4 therms of total 
energy, of which 94 per cent., or 7.9 therms, is avail- 
able for man's support, as compared with 2.2 therms 
in a daily gain of two pounds by a fattening steer or 
with 3 therms in a daily gain of one and one-half 
pounds by a two-hundred pound pig. 



THE OVERHEAD FEED COST 

Maintenance. — ^The second consideration which must 
be borne in mind in any estimate of the food conserva- 
tion through the animal is that a certain amount of 
his feed is consumed to keep the animal machinery 
running, much as a factory must first be supplied with 
enough power to keep in motion the shafting, belting 
and machinery in general before any product can be 
turned out. This, which we may call the overhead 
feed cost, is commonly spoken of as the maintenance 
requirement. 

Thus, if a thousand-pound steer is given fourteen 
pounds of timothy hay daily the six therms of net 
energy which it contains will be found to be just about 
sufficient to support him without gain or loss and he 
will neither add to nor subtract from the food supply. 
His economic efficiency is zero. It is only when his 
feed is increased beyond this lower limit that he begins 
to store up food material for man. 

Moreover, his usefulness as a food producer will 
depend upon how much feed he can consume beyond 
the minimum. If he eats twenty pounds of the hay 
daily, he will be getting in excess of his maintenance 
requirement 2.6 therms of net energy to be stored up 

25 



26 CONSERVATION OF FOOD ENERGY 

in his body, while if he can eat twenty-five pounds of 
hay he will have 4.75 therms to store up. In the one 
case his gain will be about 0.13 therm for each pound 
of hay fed and in the other case about 0.19 therm, or 
46 per cent. more. 

What is true of a simple hay ration is also true of 
the mixed rations of forage and grain used in practical 
productive feeding. A considerable fraction of the 
feed goes simply to maintain the animal and the profits 
of the feeding are largely dependent upon how much 
can be consumed beyond this limit, i. e., upon the rela- 
tion of the total volume of business transacted to the 
overhead cost. 

This is why the intensive production of meat or 
milk usually involves the use of grain or other concen- 
trated feeding stuffs. Only on very good pasture can 
an animal consume enough forage in excess of main- 
tenance to support rapid production and so ensure the 
minimum overhead cost per unit. Hay, straw and the 
like contain so much innutritions ballast that the great- 
est amount which can be eaten will support only a 
relatively small production with a correspondingly 
high feed expenditure per uni t. 

Maintenance by Forage Crops. — The overhead cost 
cannot be materially reduced, since the internal organ- 
ization of an animal is not accessible to improvement. 
The best we can do is to meet it a3 cheaply as possible. 
This can be done under ordinary conditions by the 
free use of the ordinary home-grown forage crops. 



THE OVERHEAD FEED COST 27 

which are usually much cheaper sources of nutritive 
material than the grains or their manufacturing by- 
products. Aside from the milk requirements of the 
very young animal, it has been demonstrated to be 
entirely feasible to produce good yields of milk or well 
fattened carcasses not only of cattle and sheep but of 
swine as well, on a ration containing ample roughage 
to meet the requirements for maintenance, leaving the 
concentrates to be applied directly to the production 
of human food. 

With the overhead feed cost thus provided for, it 
is a comparatively simple matter, with the data at 
hand, to estimate with a good degree of accuracy how 
much human food in the form of beef, mutton, pork 
or milk can be obtained from a pound of corn or wheat, 
for example, or of their various by-products, and thus 
to secure an approximate answer to the question pro- 
posed at the outset. 

Of course the maintenance of the animal by means 
of forage crops still has to be paid for. The point is 
that he does not have to draw on the supply of human 
food. What we are considering here is not how animal 
foods can be produced most cheaply, but how the food 
supply as a whole can be most fully conserved, and 
while the two are intimately related it is the second 
question and not the first with which food adminis- 
tration is primarily concerned. Assuming that the 
animal receives at least enough forage to supply his 
maintenance requirements, the attempt will be made 



28 CONSERVATION OF FOOD ENERGY 

in the following sections to compute what amounts of 
human food can be realized from some of the more 
important food crops of the farm when handled in 
various ways. 

Forage Crops for Production. — Of course herbivorous 
animals may readily eat more roughage than is required 
for maintenance and it is most desirable, both from the 
standpoint of economy of production and from that 
of food conservation, that they should do so. In par- 
ticular the use of excessive amounts of grain in the 
fattening of cattle and hogs, as has been the practice 
in many sections, involves the destruction of vast 
amounts of potential human food. As already pointed 
out, whatever animal products are obtained from forage 
crops are just so much added to the food supply. This, 
however, need not interfere with the proposed compari- 
sons. Even if a considerable fraction of the production 
is at the expense of roughage, whatever concentrate is 
added to such a ration, within reasonable and economic 
limits, may be expected to produce its proportional 
quota of meat and milk just as if added to a simple 
maintenance ration. 

The exact methods of computation will be illustrated 
as we proceed. 



VI 

WHEAT 

Wheat is preeminently the bread grain of the west- 
ern world. It is subjected on a large scale to only 
one manufacturing process, viz., milling. It therefore 
offers a convenient starting point for our comparisons. 
In one hundred pounds of average wheat there are 
contained about 183 therms of total energy. How 
much of this can be recovered for human nutrition? 

Feeding Directly. — Wheat is not ordinarily fed to 
domestic animals, yet it may be and was to a some- 
what considerable extent in the middle west not so 
very many years ago. If one hundred pounds of it 
were consumed by animals whose maintenance require- 
ment was already provided for, the available data as 
to net energy value (p. 20) show that out of its 183 
therms of total energy there would be retained in the 
body or in the milk 91.8 therms by beef cattle and 
sheep, 116.4 therms by dairy cows and 108.9 therms 
by swine. 

But by no means all of these amounts are available 
for human food. It was pointed out under IV that 
much of the energy in the increase of cattle, sheep 
and swine is contained in the offal and in the inedible 
portion of the carcass while there is also a further 

29 



30 CONSERVATION OF FOOD ENERGY 



small loss of energy when the edible portion or the 
milk of the cow is eaten by man. For example, in the 
case of beef cattle it was computed that only 43>^ per 
cent, of the energy contained in the body of the animal 
is actually available for human nutrition. Out of the 
91.8 therms of energy stored up in the body of the 
steer as the result of feeding one hundred pounds of 
wheat, then, only 40.0 therms would contribute to 
the food supply. Precisely similar computations for 
the other common animals give the results which fol- 
low. It might be repeated that these figures show the 
recovery by the animal after the power required to 
keep its bodily machinery running has been provided 
by other materials:

Milling. — Taking, now, the other alternative, let us 
see how much of the wheat energy can be recovered 
by milling the wheat and using only the offal for stock 
feed. The ordinary commercial milling yields about 73 
per cent, of white or "straight" flour (including a little 
"second clear" flour), about 2 per cent, of "red dog" 
flour, and 25 per cent, of shorts and bran, all of which 



WHEAT 



31 



are ordinarily used for feed although part of the red 
dog flour can also be used as an admixture with the 
higher grades of flour. A pound of "straight" flour 
supplies (p. 17) 1.65 therms of energy available to man. 
The 73 pounds obtained from one hundred pounds of 
wheat would therefore yield 120.5 therms, or consider- 
ably more than the greatest total amount recoverable 
in animal products, while in addition the offal may be 
fed to stock. 

The 27 pounds of mixed shorts, bran and red dog 
flour would contain about 49.9 therms of total energy, 
of which there would be recovered in animal products 
by cattle and sheep 15.5 therms, by dairy cows 19.6 
therms and by swine 24.2 therms. But, as is the case 
when entire wheat is fed, only part of these amoimts is 
actually available for man's nutrition. Making the 
same relative deductions as before for the inedible and 
indigestible portions of this energy, and adding to the 
remaining available energy the 120.5 therms supplied 
by the 73 pounds of wheat flour, we find there would 
be recovered for himian food the following amounts:

32 CONSERVATION OF FOOD ENERGY 

Evidently wheat makes a much greater contribution 
to human nutrition when it is converted into flour and 
only the by-products used for stock feed than when it 
is consimied directly by animals, the difference being 
very large in the case of beef and mutton production 
and considerable even in pork and milk production. 

Whole Wheat Flour. — Wheat, however, may be 
milled to yield a much larger percentage of flour and 
less offal than in the usual commercial process and 
such milling has been strongly urged as a matter of 
food economy as well as for other reasons. Some idea 
of the extent of the economy which may thus be 
effected can be obtained by a comparison with two 
familiar products, viz., whole wheat flour and graham 
flour.i 

In the production of whole wheat flour about one- 
half of the coarse bran is removed while in the manu- 
facture of graham flour the entire wheat grain, includ- 
ing the bran, enters into the flour. The resulting flours 
contain somewhat less energy per pound than "straight" 
flour, viz., whole wheat flour 1.561 therms and graham 
flour 1.505 therms. 

One hundred pounds of wheat, therefore, when manu- 
factured into graham flour would yield 151 therms of 
energy, or 82.5 per cent, of its total content, for man's 
nutrition as compared with 127 to 142 therms recovered 
when "straight" flour is produced. For the whole wheat 

^ The computations are based upon the data reported by Snyder 
in U. S. Dept. of Agr., Office Expt. Stas. Bulletins 101 and 126.

flour, assuming the bran to have the same value as a 
stock feed as that produced in the manufacture of 
"straight" flour, the figures would be as follows:

These figures make it appear that there is a slight 
advantage in milling to 86 or 87 per cent, and a greater 
advantage still in leaving all the bran in the flour as 
in the manufacture of graham flour. 



VII 
CORN 

Unlike wheat, com, although used to a considerable 
extent as food for man, is popularly regarded in the 
United States and still more in Europe as a stock feed, 
and in fact only a small percentage of the corn crop of 
the United States is utilized for human consumption. 

Besides its use as feed, however, corn serves as the 
raw material in other manufacturing processes than 
milling, such as the manufacture of hominy or of starch 
and glucose and of malt and distilled liquors. These 
various processes yield by-products useful as feeding 
stuffs so that there are a variety of possibilities open 
regarding the utilization of corn for human nutrition. 

Feeding Directly. — Taking first its utilization di- 
rectly as a stock feed, one hundred pounds of average 
corn contain about 180.3 therms of gross energy. Of 
this total there may be retained in the body or the 
milk of an animal whose maintenance is otherwise 
provided for 85.5 therms by beef cattle and sheep, 
108.4 therms by dairy cows and 118.8 therms by swine. 
Substantially the same proportions of these amounts 
as in the case of wheat would be lost in the offal and 
the inedible portions of the carcass and expended in 
the digestion of the edible part of the products. Com- 

34

puted just as in the case of wheat, the final recovery 
would be as follows:

Milling. — When corn is milled for the production of 
table meal there is obtained about 85 per cent, of bolted 
meal and 15 per cent, of corn bran. A pound of the 
meal supplies 1.655 therms of energy available to man, 
so that the 85 pounds obtained from 100 pounds of 
corn would contain 140.7 therms or, as in the case of 
wheat, considerably more than can be recovered in 
animal products when the com is fed to live stock. 

The 15 pounds of corn bran would contain about 28 
therms of total energy. When used as feed it may be 
estimated that there would be utilized by cattle and 
sheep 10.7 therms, by dairy cows 13.5 therms, and by 
swine 15.0 therms. The relative losses in the inedible 
and indigestible material of the meat or milk would 
be the same as in previous cases. Deducting these 
and adding the available energy of the 85 pounds of 
meal, the total recovery of energy for human nutrition 
in this case would be as follows:

Corn is also milled for the production of hominy, 
about 68 pounds being obtained from one hundred 
pounds of com. The by-products (hulls, germs and 
scourings) constitute hominy feed. 

A pound of hominy contains 1.65 therms of energy 
available for human nutrition, or practically the same 
amount as corn meal, so that the 68 pounds obtained 
from one hundred pounds of com would furnish 112.2 
therms. 

The 32 pounds of hominy feed would contain about 
59.2 therms of total energy, of which it may be esti- 
mated that there could be utilized under average con- 
ditions by cattle and sheep 28.4 therms, by pigs 39.5 
therms and by dairy cows 36.0 therms. Making the 
same percentage deductions as before for the inedible 
and indigestible portions, the net amount contributed 
to human nutrition would be by cattle 12.2 therms, 
by sheep 14.0 therms, by pigs 35.7 therms and by dairy 
cows 33.9 therms, and the total recovery in this method 
of utilizing corn would be as follows:

Starch and Glucose. — In the manufacture of glucose 
from corn the starch of the latter is separated as com- 
pletely as practicable by mechanical means (grinding, 
sifting and washing) and subsequently converted into 
glucose. The residues are the gluten and hulls of the 
corn and the materials dissolved in the steep water, 
together constituting gluten feed, and the germs from 
which the corn oil is pressed leaving as a residue germ 
oil cake. From one hundred pounds of corn there are 
obtained 24.5 pounds of gluten feed, 3.5 pounds of germ 
oil cake, 3 pounds of corn oil and 65 pounds of starch, 
equivalent to 72 .2 pounds of glucose. Of these the starch 
or the glucose and the corn oil are at least potentially 
available for human food while the gluten feed and the 
germ oil cake are useful only for animals. Starch sup- 
plies 1.86 therms of available energy per pound, equiva- 
lent to 1.67 therms per pound of glucose, and the corn 
oil may be reckoned at 4.22 therms per pound. The 
edible products from 100 pounds of corn thus treated 
would therefore supply a total of 133.6 therms, assum- 



3S CONSERVATION OF FOOD ENERGY 

ing the oil to be used as food, or 120.9 therms omitting 
the oil. 

From the by-products when fed to stock there may 
be recovered in the body or the milk in the case of 
gluten feed 19.8 therms by cattle or sheep, 25.1 therms 
by dairy cows and 27.5 therms by hogs. For the germ 
oil cake the corresponding figures would be 2.9 therms 
by cattle and sheep, 3.7 therms by dairy cows and 3.7 
therms by pigs. Making the same percentage deduc- 
tions as before for the inedible and indigestible portions 
of the animal products, we get as a final result per 100 
pounds the following:

Distilling. — Still another method of utilizing corn is 
as the raw material for the production of malt and dis- 
tilled liquors or of alcohol. 

Of the seventy and one-half million bushels of grain 
reported to have been used in brewing in the United 
States in 1916, corn made up a little over twenty-two 
per cent., the remainder being chiefly barley with a 
little rice. The recovery of food value in brewing may 



CORN 39 

therefore be more advantageously discussed in connec- 
tion with barley. 

On the other hand, corn is an important source of 
distilled liquors and of commercial alcohol. Based on 
the experience of distillers, there may be computed from 
the composition of corn a commercial yield of 17.9 
pounds of pure alcohol per bushel, or 32 pounds per 
hundred. Distillers generally use mixed grains (corn, 
rye and malted barley) and obtain an average yield 
of 17.2 pounds per bushel (56 pounds) of mixed grain, 
equivalent to 30.7 pounds per hundred pounds of grain, 
a result confirming the figure given above for corn. 
The by-product of distillation is distillers' grains, the 
yield of which, in the dried state, may probably be 
estimated to be about the same as that of brewers' 
grains in the production of beer, viz., 28 pounds per 
hundred of grain. 

The 28 pounds of dried distillers' grains would con- 
tain in the neighborhood of 56 therms of total energy, 
of which there could be recovered in the bodies or 
milk of animals to which it was fed, on the same assump- 
tions as in previous cases, 23.8 therms by cattle and 
sheep, 33.2 therms by pigs and 30.2 therms by dairy 
cows. Deducting the loss in the inedible and indi- 
gestible materials, there would be recovered as human 
food, 10.4 therms in the case of cattle, 11.7 therms in 
the case of sheep, 30.0 therms in the case of pigs and 
28.4 therms in the case of dairy cows. 

Food Value of Alcohol. — The final conclusions as to 



40 CONSERVATION OF FOOD ENERGY 

the proportion of the total energy of the corn which is 
recovered for human nutrition will depend upon whether 
the alcohol is regarded as a food. This question, in the 
judgment of the writer, should be answered in the nega- 
tive so far as food conservation is concerned. 

It is true that it has been established beyond con- 
troversy that dilute alcohol in moderate amounts may 
not only be burned in the human organism but may 
replace an equivalent amount of such materials as 
carbohydrates and fats which are universally recog- 
nized as foods. On this basis one pound of pure alcohol 
would yield 3.14 therms of available energy. This, 
however, by no means warrants placing this energy on 
the credit side of the account. 

First, a considerable proportion of the alcohol pro- 
duced is used for commercial and manufacturing pur- 
poses and does not enter in any way into the food 
supply. 

Second, distilled liquors are not consumed for the 
sake of their food value but as beverages for the sake 
of their flavor or as a result of habit. To attempt to 
supply any considerable part of the daily food require- 
ment in this way would almost certainly produce more 
or less of the deleterious effects noted in the next 
paragraph. 

Third, the physiological effects, other than nutritive, 
must be reckoned with. Quite aside from the familiar 
results of excessive drinking, and the dangers of alcohol 
as a habit-forming drug, it appears well established 



CORN 



41 



that its effect as a narcotic on the nervous system and 
on both physical and mental efficiency goes far to offset 
its nutritive value. Alcohol can doubtless be utilized 
to a limited extent as a source of energy for the human 
machine but its use deposits grit in the bearings and 
slows down the machine so that it is very questionable 
whether it adds to the effective food supply. 

In the following comparison, however, to be per- 
fectly impartial, the percentage recovery of the energy 
of the corn has been computed both excluding and in- 
cluding the possible food value of the alcohol.

VIII 
BARLEY 

Barley is used chiefly as a feed grain and in the 
manufacture of beer, comparatively little barley flour 
having been produced until recently. 

Feeding Directly. — Average barley contains about 
184 therms of gross energy per one hundred pounds. 
When fed directly to live stock it may be estimated, 
in precisely the same way as in the case of wheat or 
corn, that the following amounts would be recovered 
for man's use in the meat or milk produced.

Brewing. — In 1916 about fifty-two and one-half 
million bushels of barley, or about twenty-nine per 
cent, of the total crop, were used in the United States 
for the production of beer. According to competent 
authorities, one hundred pounds of barley yield in 
good average practice: 

Beer 421 lbs. 

Dried brewers' grains 28 " 

Malt sprouts 4 " 

Dried yeast 2 " 

The beer will contain about 0.5 per cent, of protein, 
5.0 per cent, of carbohydrates (chiefly dextrin-like 
substances) and 3.5 per cent, of alcohol. Including 
the alcohol, the 421 pounds of beer would contain 88.3 
therms of energy available to man, while excluding 
the alcohol reduces the amount to 42.0 therms. 



44 CONSERVATION OF FOOD ENERGY 

The brewers' grains, malt sprouts, and spent yeast 
are available as stock feeds and the recovery of food 
energy from each may be computed as in previous 
cases, with the following results:

Even if the alcohol be included, the recovery of

though somewhat greater than that secured when the 
barley is used directly as feed. If the alcohol be not 
included, the recovery in brewing is much less than 
that obtained by feeding the barley to pigs or cows 
and little if at all greater than that secured by feeding 
it to cattle or sheep.

RYE 



Rye, like wheat, may be fed directly to live stock 
or may be milled for the production of rye flour, while 
in the past considerable amounts have been consumed 
in the manufacture of distilled liquors. 

Feeding Directly. — One hundred pounds of rye con- 
tain about 184 therms of gross energy. When fed to 
live stock the recovery, computed as before, is:

Distilling. — When used for the production of dis- 
tilled liquor, rye is stated to yield some five per cent, 
less alcohol than com, or about 30.4 pounds per hun- 
dred pounds of rye. Computed, as in the case of com, 
both with and without the alcohol, the recovery of 
energy in the edible products is:

Feeding or Milling. — ^Aside from the relatively small 
amount of rice used in brewing, these grains are either 
used directly as stock feeds or milled for the produc- 
tion of table meal or breakfast foods. The estimation 
of the energy recovery by the two methods is made 
precisely as in previous cases and as before shows a 
much higher utilization when as large a proportion of 
the grain as possible is consumed directly by man. 
It hardly seems necessary to give the details of the 
calculations. The final results are as follows:

COTTONSEED 



Cottonseed is not directly available as food for man 
but yields an edible oil which is coming into use to 
an increasing extent, while from the press residue 
(cottonseed meal) there is manufactured a cottonseed 
flour which promises to be of value as human food. 

Feeding Directly. — Cottonseed contains about 242 
therms of total energy per one hundred pounds. When 
it is fed to live stock the recovery of energy in edible 
products, computed as in previous instances, may be 
estimated as follows. No figures have been computed 
for swine since cottonseed is not regarded as a safe 
feed for this species.

Oil Extraction. — In the cottonseed oil mills one hundred 
poimds of seed yield about 15.7 pounds of oil and 49.7 
pounds of cake or meal, the remainder being linters 
and hulls whose feeding value is for the present pur- 
pose negligible. From the 49.7 pounds of cottonseed 
meal there may be recovered in edible and digestible 
form in the carcass or milk of the animal to which it 

49 



50 CONSERVATION OF FOOD ENERGY 



is fed the amounts shown below, while the oil, if used 
directly as human food, may be reckoned at 4.22 therms 
per pound, or a total of 66.3 therms, so that the total 
utilization would be as follows:

Cottonseed Flour. — Cottonseed flour is made from 
cottonseed meal by a special treatment which removes 
the hulls as thoroughly as possible. The writer has 
been unable to secure any information regarding the 
yield of cottonseed flour, but the data regarding its 
composition seem to indicate that at least 60 per cent, 
of prime cottonseed meal may be recovered in the 
flour, equivalent to 29.8 poimds from one hundred 
pounds of cottonseed. On the basis of digestion experi- 
ments it may be estimated that a pound of the flour 
contains 1.53 therms of energy available for human 
nutrition. The 29.8 pounds estimated to be obtained 
from 100 pounds of cottonseed would accordingly be 
equivalent to 45.6 therms, which added to the 66.3 
therms recovered in the oil makes a total recovered of 
111.9 therms, or 46 per cent., in addition to whatever 
could be recovered by feeding the residue from the 
preparation of the flour to live stock. 



XII 

PEANUTS 

While the peanut, either as the roasted nut or in the 
form of peanut butter, is usually regarded as a con- 
diment rather than as a food, it is capable of con- 
tributing materially to human nutrition. There is 
also now being offered in the market a peanut flour, 
prepared from the press cake left in the manufacture 
of peanut oil, while the oil itself if properly made is a 
valuable food. 

The writer has been unable to secure any data re- 
garding the yield of peanut flour from a unit of raw 
material. The following comparisons therefore are 
between the nuts used exclusively as human food, 
exclusively as stock feed, or for the manufacture of 
oil, the press cake being fed to animals. All the data 
relate to the hulled nuts. 

Feeding Directly. — One hundred pounds of hulled 
peanuts contain about 276.3 therms of energy. When 
they are fed directly to stock, the following figures 
may be computed in the same manner as in previous 
cases:

Oil Extraction. — One hundred pounds of hulled pea- 
nuts are stated to yield 60 pounds of peanut cake and 
40 pounds of oil. The oil may be estimated to con- 
tain 4.22 therms per pound of energy available for 
man, or a total of 168.8 therms. The value recovered 
from the cake when fed to stock may be estimated as 
before and the total recovery computed as follows:

Finally, one hundred pounds of peanuts used directly 
as human food would supply 256.0 therms of energy or 
93 per cent, of their gross energy. 



XIII 
MILK 

In all the foregoing comparisons it has been assumed 
that the milk produced by dairy cows is consumed 
directly as human food. Milk itself, however, serves 
as the raw material for the manufacture of butter or 
cheese and of small amounts of other food products. 

Butter Making. — In the manufacture of butter it is 
possible also to use the resulting skim milk and butter- 
milk as human food, in which case the total food value 
may be considered to be practically the same as that 
of the fresh milk. As a matter of fact most of them 
are fed to animals. 

One hundred pounds of 4 per cent, milk contain 
30.6 therms of total energy of which 28.8 therms, or 
94 per cent., is available to man. It will yield about 
four pounds of butter containing per pound 3.61 therms 
of available energy, or a total of 14.42 therms, 12 pounds 
of buttermilk and 84 pounds of skim milk. When the 
by-products are fed to calves or pigs, the amounts of 
energy recovered in the edible and digestible forms 
would be:

In other words, the percentage recovery when butter 
is manufactured and the by-products fed to animals is 
about 70 to 90 per cent, as compared with 94 per cent, 
when the milk is consumed as such. The estimates of 
the recovery of the energy of various materials made 
in previous pages must evidently be reduced in this 
proportion when butter instead of milk is the main 
object of the feeding. 

Cheese Making. — In the manufacture of cheese, the 
whey is practically available only as stock feed. 

One hundred pounds of milk will yield about 10 
pounds of cheese and 90 pounds of whey. Ten pounds 
of cheese have an energy value of 19.5 therms as

human food, while 90 pounds of whey would yield 4.1 
therms in animal products when fed to calves and 8.5 
therms when fed to pigs and the total recovery can be 
tabulated as follows:

SUMMARY 

In the foregoing pages the attempt has been made 
to compare the efficiency of the various methods by 
which some of the more important farm products 
may be made to contribute to the food supply. The 
comparisons are based solely upon the proportion of 
the total energy of these products which can be recov- 
ered for man's use and take no account of the relative 
utilization of the protein and mineral ingredients nor 
of the presence or absence of accessory ingredients 
(vitamines). While all these are essential requirements 
for nutrition, quantitatively the principal function of 
food is to supply energy and a knowledge of the relative 
amounts of energy which can be recovered in various 
methods of utilization is a factor of prime importance 
in food conservation. 

The results obtained are approximate averages only. 
Such calculations must necessarily be based on average 
figures and refer to average conditions. Moreover, 
some of the factors employed in the computations are 
by no means so exactly established as is desirable. 
Consequently, while the mathematical computations 
are believed to be correct, the reader should beware of 

56 



SUMMARY 57 

laying too much stress on small differences. On the 
other hand certain broad teachings are evident. 

Loss in Feeding. — The most obvious of these is the 
great loss of energy involved in the conversion of 
vegetable into animal products, that is, in the feeding 
of live stock. It is here assumed that the maintenance 
of the animal is provided for by a sufficient supply of 
forage of one sort or another, so that the body resembles 
a factory already supplied with sufficient power to run 
the emp^y machinery. Even under these conditions, 
however, with none of the energy of the added grain 
expended in supporting the overhead cost, it appears 
that from thirty-nine to as much as eighty-six per cent, 
of the energy of grains consumed by animals is lost in 
one way or another and only from fourteen to sixty- 
one per cent, is recovered for man's use. Obviously, 
the diversion to stock feeding of any material edible by 
man is from this standpoint a very wasteful proceeding. 

Comparison of Animals. — Another fact which appears 
clearly is that the percentage recovery of energy in 
animal products differs widely with the nature of the 
animals fed. In this respect cattle and sheep form one 
distinct group and pigs and dairy cows another, the 
differences within each group being relatively small. 
In the production of beef and mutton the loss is very 
large, ranging from seventy-five to eighty-six per cent. 
This is due in part to the extensive fermentation which 
occurs in the stomach of cattle and sheep and in part 
to the relatively large proportion of inedible material 



58 CONSERVATION OF FOOD ENERGY 

contained in their bodies. In pork and milk produc- 
tion the losses are notably smaller, ranging from thirty- 
nine to sixty-six per cent. The body of the pig contains 
much less inedible matter than that of the steer or the 
sheep and his feed is subject to fermentation to a far 
less degree than in ruminants. In milk production the 
conversion appears to be decidedly more efficient than 
in meat production while there is no inedible waste. 

Inedible Products Saved. — On the other hand, the 
animal performs a most important function in the 
utilization of products inedible by man. The various 
forage crops and the inedible by-products of manu- 
facturing can, through the medium of the animal, be 
made tributary to man's support. It is true that there 
may be an even greater loss in the conversion than 
obtains with the grains but whatever is thus recovered 
is so much added to the food supply and the importance 
of utilizing these materials to the greatest practicable 
extent can hardly be overemphasized. 

Milling vs. Feeding. — It is clear, then, that the en- 
deavor should be to utilize as large a proportion of 
vegetable products as is possible directly as human 
food, leaving only the by-products to be fed to stock. 
In the case of the cereals this is accomplished chiefly 
by some form of milling. The total recovery of energy 
effected in this way is relatively high, ranging from 
j&f ty-six to eighty-one per cent, when the offals are used 
for beef and mutton production and from sixty to eighty- 
five per cent, when they are used for pork and milk

Vegetable Oils. — In the case of the oil-bearing seeds 
a high percentage recovery may also be computed on 
the assumption that the resulting vegetable oils are 
used for food purposes, an assumption which appears 
to be far from corresponding with present facts. Sim- 
ilarly, a high recovery is estimated in the manufacture 
of starch and glucose only on the assumption that 
these products are all utilized as food.

industries, on the contrary, show a very low utiliza- 
tion of the energy of their raw materials unless the 
full theoretical food value is assigned to the alcohol 
produced. Only some twenty-eight to thirty-five per 
cent, is recovered in other products in brewing and 
only from four to sixteen per cent, in distilling. Even 
if the alcohol be included in the computation the re- 
covery is still notably lower than that obtained by 
milling the same materials, as appears from the fol- 
lowing tabulation:
