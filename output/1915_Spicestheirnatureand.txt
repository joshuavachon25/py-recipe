DEDICATED TO Domestic 
Science and to those who 
are devoting their energy, 
talent and time to the dissemination 
of that knowledge which makes for 
purer and better foods — to the Do- 
mestic Science Teachers of America. 



IN response to hiinLlrccls of re- 
quests from schools, colleges and 
individuals for information re- 
garding the difl'erent varieties of 
Spices we have prepared this book- 
let, and have endeavored to give as 
concisely as possible the facts neces- 
sary to a thorough understanding 
of the subject. 

As there has hitherto been no com- 
plete compilation along this line, it 
has been necessary to obtain from 
foreign sources much of the material, 
while some of the illustrations repre- 
sent weeks of patient research by 
our art department. 

To the U. S. Department of Agricul- 
ture we are indebted for much valu- 
able information, and for this we 
wish to make due acknowledgment.

Pepper and Capsicums 

EPPER is the dried berry 
of the pepper-plant {Pi- 
per nigrum), a climbing 
vine ten to twelve feet 
high, indigenous to the 
East Indies, but culti- 
vated in many tropical 
countries. 

The berries are hai"- 
vested when they begin 
to turn red, and the pro- 
cess of drying out black- 
ens and shrivels them. 
They are not picked 
separately, but in spikes 
or bunches, and are then 
placed on mats to dry. At night the berries are placed under cover. 
The average yield per vine is eight to ten pounds each year. 
The different varieties of Black Pepper derive their name from 
the localities in which they are grown or the ports whence they are 
shipped, as Singapore, Lampong, Sumatra, Tellicherry, Acheen, 
N4alabar, Trang, etc. 

White Pepper 

This is obtained by decorticating or removing the skin from the 
fully ripened black peppercorns — accomplished by maceration. 

White Whole Pepper grains are grayish white. They are more 
nearly spherical in shape than the Black Pepper berries, and ha\'e 
light-colored lines running from top to bottom. The more common 
varieties are known as Siam, Singapore and Penang, 

Red Pepper 

The U. S. Standards describe Red Pepper as the dried ripe fruit 
of any species of capsicum, a genus of the nightshade family indige- 
nous to the American tropics. It is now cultivated in nearly all warm 
and temperate countries, both commercially and in the kitchen- 
garden. The leading commercial \arieties are Zanzibar Africa, 
Indias and Japan. 

Paprika 

Paprika is botanically described as Capsicum annuiim. The pods 
are large and brilliant to dark red. It grows in the temperate and 
torrid zones. It is cultivated principally in Spain (Pimiinton) and 
Hungary. The Spanish-grown product is sweet and mild; the Hun- 
garian usually of a mildly pungent flavor. Paprika is used in cooking 
for its color as well as flavor. It is rapidly finding favor among 
American housewives.

Cassia and Cinnamon 

HE terms Cassia and 
Cinnamon, although 
they represent two sep- 
arate species of the ge- 
nus Cinnamomum be- 
longing to the Laurel 
family, in commerce are 
interchangeable. 

Cinnamon 

Is the thin, inner 
bark of the tree, of a 
pale yellowish brown 
color, and is found on 
the market in long, 
quill - like rolls, the 
smaller rolls l^eing incased in the larger. The small dark spots on 
the outer surface correspond to points where the leaves were attached 
to the stem. 

True Cinnamon is native to the Island of Ceylon, but is culti- 
vated in tropical Asia, Sumatra and Java. The yield of Ceylon 
Cinnamon is relatively small. Its use in the United States is limited. 

Cassia 

The ordinary commercial Cassia is the bark of the Cinnamomum 
Cassia, which comes from China, Japan, Indo-China and India. It 
is usually darker in color than true Cinnamon rougher, and about 
four times as thick. 

Cinnamon and Cassia range in \alue according to type and 
quality, although much depends on actual flavoring strength. The\ 
are chiefly \alued in the order named — Saigon, Batavia or Java and 
China. 

Those desiring a pure Ceylon Cinnamon can secure it from 
McCormick & Company of Baltimore, Importers and Grinders ot 
Spices. Choicest Cassia, in rolls or ground, is put up under their 
Bee Brand and Banquet Brand Trade Marks.

Nutmegs and Mace 

THE Nutmeg-trcc, genus Myristica (natural order Myristic- 
aceoe), native of the Malay Archipelago, usually grows to a 
height of twenty to thirty feet. While the greater part of 
the world's supply of both Nutmegs and Mace comes from the 
Banda Islands, the West Indies are by no means to be overlooked. 

The Nutmeg fruit is about three inches long and about two inches 
in diam.eter. It includes, first, the outer or fleshy m.embranous part; 
second, the substance covering the outer shell of the Nutmeg, known 
as Mace, next the shell, and finally the kernel or commercial Nutmeg. 

After harvesting, which in some places is done with long forked 
sticks or bamboo poles, the red colored network (Mace) is removed 
and the nuts are placed over a fire in mesh bottom receptacles, 
where they remain for perhaps a month, being kept about ten feet 
away from the flames. They are next exposed to the sun for two 
or three hours daily for several days, or until the kernels rattle 
within the shell. They are then removed from the shell and assorted 
into three general grades. 

Among the many varieties of Nutmegs the Singapore, Penang, 
West Indian and Macassars are most esteemed, the price being 
regulated by the type, size and quality of the nut. 

During the past few years ground Nutmeg has been placed on 
the market and is steadily finding favor with American housewives. 

Mace 

Mace is carefully removed from the shell 
surrounding the kernel of the Nutmeg by 
hand, although a knife is sometimes em- 
ployed. It is then placed on mats or trays to 
dry in the sunshine. Of late years, however, 
artificial drying has proven so successful that 
it is rapidly supplanting the old method in 
which the sunshine dissipated some of the 
virtues of the Mace. Several months are re- 
quireel to cure it. During this time it changes 
from a crimson to a blood red and later to the 
yellowish or golden brown color, in which state 
it is found on the market here. 

The Penang or Banda Mace is probably 
the most desirable, with the Siauw and 
Batavia following in the order named. 

Great care must be exercised in the grind- 
ing of Mace, as it is very rich in volatile oil. 
Bee Brand Ground Mace is prepared in mills 
especially designed for the purpose. Nutmegs 
and Mace imported by McCorm ick & Company 
are marketed as Bee and Banquet Brands.

Ginger 



UNLlIxE the Spices treated in this series, 
Ginger is the root-stock of a plant 
known botanically as Zingiber officinale, 
an annual herb, three or four feet high. It is a 
native of India and China, but is grown ex- 
tensively in tropical America, Africa and Aus- 
tralia. 

The plant endures a w ide range ot climate. 
It may be grown at sea le\'ei or in mountainous 
regions, provided the rainfall be abundant or 
irrigation adopted. 

It is found cultivated from the Himalaxa 
Mountains, 5000 feet above sea lexel, to Cape 
Comarin. 

The root is dug when the plant is a \ear old 
and after the stalk has withered. 

Black Ginger, of w hich Calcutta and Afri- 
can are the common \arieties, is produced by 
scalding the freshly dug roots. This prevents 
sprouting. 

White Ginger is the decorticated product, 
the chief varieties being Jamaica, Cochin and 

Japan. Jamaica is the most esteemed. Jamaica Ginger is best know n 
and most used here, although both Cochin and African Ginger are 
imported in a large wa\'. 

The different \arieties of Ginger are imported b\ McCormick 6<; 
Company, who clistribLite them under the Bee Brand and Banquet 
Brand guarantee. Green Ginger is the undried root. That received 
in the United States is the Jamaica \ariety.

Pimento, or Allspice 

HE Pimento (Pimenta 
officinalis), an evergreen 
tree belonging to the 
Myrtle family, is a na- 
tive of the West Indies, 
but is found in Mexico, 
Costa Rica and Vene- 
zuela as well. The high- 
est quality Pimento 
comes from the Island 
of Jamaica. The Mexi- 
can berry, while hand- 
some in appearance, is 
inferior in flavoring 
quality. 

Racketing Sp.ces yj^^^ ^^.^^^ uSUallv 

grow in groups of from five to twenty, but aie sometimes founel in 
forests. After the tree has attained a certain growth, the underbrush 
and other Pimentos are cut away, leaving the trees about twenty-five 
feet apart. 

The Pimento flowers twice each year, but bears only one crop of 
berries. 

The problem of harvesting is the most serious with which the 
planter has to contend. It is difficult to secure help among the 
indolent natives, and as the harvest season is short — because the 
berries must be picked just before they ripen — the loss from over- 
ripening is very great. After harvesting, the berries are exposed 
daily to the sun for a period of from seven to twelve days, being 
placed under cover each night. 

Pimento, or Allspice, as it is generally known, is exported princi- 
pally from Kingston, Jamaica, in 120 to 130 lb. bags, about one-third 
of the crop coming to the United States, while the remainder finds its 
way to England, whence it is exported to other countries. 

As its common name implies. Allspice has a flavor which is 
suggestive of the combined flavors of many spices. 

McCormick & Company import only the choicest Allspice grown 
and market it under their Bee Brancl and Banquet Brand trade 
marks. It may be had either ground or whole.

Cloves 

CLOVES ai'e the dry llower-bucls of an 
evergreen {Caryophyllus, Aromaticus 
or Eugenia caryophyllata) belonging 
to the Myrtle family, averaging in height 
twenty to forty feet. The Clove-tree is cul- 
tivated in Ceylon, India, Mauritius, the 
West Indies and Zanzibar. The different va- 
rieties derive their names from the district 
of origin or the city of exportation. Cloves 
from Amboyna, Penang and Zanzibar are 
perhaps best known and ai'c in greatest de- 
mand. 

The flowers grow in clusters. The green 
buds change to a reddish hue, at which 
stage they are removed from the tree, spread 
in the sun and allowed to dry. When allowed 
to fully fruit, the bud dexelops into a hard 
seed an inch long, with a pulpy co\er. This 
is called Mother of Cloxes. 

The tree yields only one crop a year, the 
yield under normal conditions being about 
>00 pounds to the acre. The average con- 
sumption is estimated at 1 1,000,000 pounds per year. 

There are a number of varieties of Cloves resembling each other 
in appearance, but vastly different in pungency and llaxoiing value. 

The slender stems bearing the closed buds ha\e, to a limited de- 
gree, the aromatic clo\e fiavor, and as they sell for a \ery small 
fraction of the cost of Cloves, are frequently powdered an^l used 
for reducing the cost of Powdered Cloves, at the expense of qualit\ 
and of common honest\ . 

McCormick & Company do not import, buy or sell Clove stems. 
Their Bee and Banquet Brands Cloves, whole or ground, are carefully 
selected for superior quality.

stock under a slightly different process. 

Marjoram 

The leaf of a shrubby plant, a genus of the Mint family, native 
to the shores of the Mediterranean; usualK called Sweet Marjoram. 

Mustard 

Mustard-Seecl comes from Russia, Germany, England ani.! Hol- 
land, and to some extent from California. There are two chief divi- 
sions, yellow and brown. The brown seed comes largely from Itah' 
and is known as Bari. The term Trieste is frequently applied to all 
brown Mustard-Seeds. 

Mustard-Seed contains two oils, known as Essential and b^atty. 
The Essential Oil is soluble in water. In flavor and odor it closeK 
resembles horseradish. The Patty Oil is mild and tasteless, insoluble 
in water, and is sometimes used in place of olive oil. 

In manufacturing Mustard-Flour the seed is warmed, subjected 
to hydraulic pressure, which releases from fifteen to twenty-five per 
cent of the fatty oil. The residue is called Mustard-Cake. It is ground 
and bolted on fine sieves, separating the Mustard bran or hulls from 
the interior, making ground mustard or flour. Brown seed contains 
a larger percentage of the essential oil, and, therefore, makes a hotter 
or stronger flour than the yellow variety, and must be blended w ith 
flour from yellow seed. 

Sage 

A perennial shrub about two feet high, native to Southern Europe, 
but cultivated in this country as a garden plant. Bee Brand Rubbed 
Sage is the finest Sage imported. It is rubbed and ready for use.

Vanilla-Bean 




One of the Extract Stills 



HE Vanilla-Bean is the 
fruit of the Vanilla 
lilanifolia or flat-leaved 
Vanilla vine and is the 
source from which pure 
or true Vanilla Extract 
is made. This climbing 
perennial belongs to the 
Orchid family and is in- 
digenous to Central and 
South America, but 
reaches its perfection of 
flavor in Vlexico. The 
Mexican bean some- 
times attains a length 
of ten inches. 

When gathered, the beans are yellowish green, fleshy and without 
OLlor. Their color and odor is developed by a process ot fermentation 
or sweating, which differs in various countries. The best method 
consists of sun-dr>ing for about a month, the beans being pressed 
alternately between the folds of blankets and exposed to the air. 
.After curing thev are tied in bundles. Vanilla-Beans when cured 
exude and become covered with fine frostlike crystals ot \anillin, 
the important active flavoring principle. 

Next in \-alue to the Mexican bean comes the Bourbon, which 
term is applied to all the Vanilla-Beans grown in the islands ot the 
Indian Ocean, otf the east coast of Africa, of which Madagascar, 
Reunion, the Comores, Mauritius and the Seychelles are most im- 
portant. These beans are shorter than the Mexican, decidedly in- 
ferior in tlaxoring qualitv, and, therefore, less expensive. They more 
nearly resemble the Tonka bean in odor. The cheapest beans are the 
Tahitis and so-called vanillons or beans of the wild Vanilla (Vanilla 
pompona). They are little used in extract making, and properly so, 
as they ha\e neither strength nor flavor. 

The Tonka bean is here mentioned simply because it is so largely 
used in the manufacture of imitation Vanilla Extracts. It is the seed 
of the Diptenx odorata. native to Guiana. The pod is almond shaped 
and contains a single seed shaped like a kidney-bean. This bean is 
dark in color, having a thin, shiny, brittle skin, containing a two- 
lobed oily kernel. A hundred years ago these beans were found in 
the snuffbox of ever\- gentleman and in the handkerchief case ot 
e\ery lady.

Tea 




OMMERCIAL Tea is 
the prepared leaf or 
Icaf-biicl of an ever- 
green, indigenous to 
Asia, which in its wild 
state attains the general 
proportions of the 
American peach-tree. 
Botanicalh', it is known 
as Camellis Thea or 
'Thea Chinensis. Under 
cultivation, it is kept 
pruned to within three 
to five feet high. The 
constant pruning en- 
courages the growth of 
new branches and new lea\cs. The \alue of the Tea is in the young 
tender leaf. 

Teas are di\ ided into two groups, which dilter chiedy in the 
method of curing. A tea-plant may produce a leaf which commer- 
cially may be either black or green, depending on the treatment. 

Green Tea is prepared by steaming the fresh green leaf and 
then drying it. In this way the bright color is preserved. 

Black Tea is the result of oxidization or fermentation, caused by 
exposing the leaves to the sun, which turns them black. 

The best Teas are made from the young leaves, the different 
\arieties being graded according to their age and position on the 
shoot. 

Tea is produced in large quantities in China, japan, India and 
the islands of Ceylon, Java and Formosa. 

There are about 200 varieties of Teas, and, perhaps, ten times 
as many flavors. Tea ranges in value 
from a few cents per pound for stems 
up to $10.00 for the very finest leaf. 

The GoNcrnment inspects all teas 
entering the United States, and those 
below a certain standard are not al- 
lowed to enter the country. 

Tea drinking in the United States 
is increasing, but the consumption is 
still far behind that of man\' other 
countries. 

The average American housewife 
has not given to the brewing of tea the 
same careful consideration she gives to 
the preparation of other beverages.

Flavoring Extracts 

The Unite^l States Agricultural Department, Circular No. 1^^, 
contains the standards for foods. Among these are standards for 
Flavoring Extracts. By this regulation Extract of Lemon must eon- 
tain at least 6.4 ounces of Oil of Lemon to 1 gallon of finished prod- 
uct, or, as the circular puts it, 5 per cent Oil of Lemon by volume, 
and Vanilla Extract the extractive matter from at least 13.35 ounces 
of the bean to the gallon of finished product. 1 he flavor is extracted 
from the bean by a mixture of alcohol and water, as the resins in the 
Vanilla-Bean will not impart their flavor to alcohol alone or to 
water alone, but to a mixture containing from 40 to 60 per cent of 
alcohol, according to character of bean. Long experience is required 
to accomplish the results desired. 

The Vanilla-Beans brought into this country i-ange in piMce about 
as follows: 

Mexican, $3.50 to $6.00 per pound. 

Bourbon, $3.00 to $5.50 per pound. 

Guadalupe, $3.00 to $5.50 per pound. 

Seychelles, $3.25 to $4.50 per pound. 

Tahiti, $1.75 to $2.50 per pound. 

And a large variety, such as Java, South .American and others, 
ranging in price from $2.75 to $5.00 per pourn.!. 

These prices represent wholesale prices an^l \ary from time to 
time. 

The use of Tahiti Beans, coming from the Islands of lahiti, 
has grown very largely in the last few years. They are much used 
by manufacturers making the cheaper extracts. 

The Vanilla-Bean dries out very quickly, but if properly cared 
for and protected does not lose its strength. In fact, the flavor 
greatly improves with age. 

The same beans can be treated for extract by dilTerent persons 
and an entirely different quality of goods produced, just as two 
cooks can take the same kind of flour and one will produce a delight- 
ful loaf of bread while the bread of the other will not be fit to eat. 

We age our Bee Brand Extracts for two years in white oak casks 
before placing them on the market. Thus they become mellow and 
have a rich, dainty bouquet, which cannot be obtained by any 
other process. The minimum cost of carrying large vats of Vanilla 
is about 12 to 15 per cent per year. A fine, properly aged Extract

of Vanilla, such as Bee Brand, made from the best beans, would cost 
from $8.00 to $9.00 a gallon to manufacture, and yet "Strictly Pure 
U. S. Standard Extracts" can be made to cost not over $3.50 per 

gallon. 

Frequently vou will find that a cheap pure hxtract ot Vanilla is 
almost as strong as the fine, or high priced. Bee Brand goods, but 
its flavor is rank and it has not the same bouquet and delicacy ot 
lla\or, the comparison between the two being the same as that 
between cheap cigars (three for 5 cents), which may be just as 
strong as a fine Havana, or stronger, which costs 25 cents, but the 
latter has a flavor and quality which the former do not approach. 

The average consumer thinks if an Extract is pure it must be 
good, and is satisfied with that statement. This belief on the part 
of the consumer is largely due to the fact that many jobbers and large 
retailers want their goods under their own names, requesting the 
manufacturer to put up the cheapest Extract that will comply with 
the law, regardless of the kind of beans or other materials used in 
its manufacture. They simply ask for goods that comply with 
State and National laws, but you can readily see what the word 
"pure" means under this condition. 

These jobbers and retailers think w hen they have complied w ith 
the law they have done all that is necessary. We refuse positively to 
sell our Bee Brand goods, or any other Flavoring Extracts, under 
any other name than our ow n. 

The consumer must realize that purity is one thing, strength 
another, but qualitw the cardinal feature by which to judge, can be 
obtained only by buying goods under the name of a reputable manu- 
facturer. ! A- 11 O 

At one time the use of the ground or pulverized VaniUa-Dean 
directly in the article to be flavored was considered by bakers and 
ice-cream manufacturers a strong card to feature in their advertising. 

Since the introduction of Domestic Science into so many of our 
educational institutions, with the subsequent general interest which 
the movement has aroused, the American housewife has come to 
learn that by the use of the ground bean only one ot the se\eral 
flavoring principles is obtained, /. e., vanillin. 

The other active agents may be obtained only by intensive pro- 
cessing, and thus a full-toned extract is secured. 

There is a great deal of "Vanilla Compound," or "Imitation 
Vanilla," sold. This is made always from manufactured Vanillin or 
Coumarin, or both. The natural Vanillin comes from Vanilla-Beans 
themselves. Put a fresh Vanilla-Bean where it is \ery cold and 
crvstals will form on the outside. These crystals are pure Vanillin. 
For a long time this was thought to be the only flavoring principle 
of the Vanilla-Bean, but it has been proven to be only one of a 
number. 

The Vanillin in general use ismanutactured by artificial means. It 
is a white powdery substance with a strong Vanilla-like flavor, but it 

123] 



McCORMICKXnd COMPANY 



lacks that softness which only Vanilla-Beans produce. In the process 
of making cheap Extracts, Vanillin is frequently toned up in strength 
and pungency with Coumarin. 

Coumarin occurs naturally in Tonka Beans and Deer Tongue. 
The Tonka Bean is a short, stumpy bean about 1 >2 to 2 inches long 
by }^ inch wide, and is used for flavoring tobacco. Coumarin is 
made commercially from the leaves of Virginia Deer Tongue and is 
manufactured in very large quantities, as it is cheaper than that 
made from Tonka Beans. 

It may be of interest to know that Bee Brand I^'lavoring Extracts 
were awarded the only Gold Medal at the Jamestown Exposition, 
and that we now have the only Gold Medal awarded f^lavoring 
Extracts since the National Pure Eood Laws have been in existence. 

The Committee on Awards had no connection with the Exposition 
Company, as it was appointed personally by Ex-President Roosevelt, 
who named Dr. Harvey T. Wiley as chairman.

1 his book is the result of many years of conscientious effort to 
produce a work which would be worthy of the title — The E^lue Book 
of the Culinary Art. 

The old Colonial homes of Maryland and Virginia, long famous 
for their "Southern Cooking,"' have yielded most of the recipes. 
Graduates of leading Schools of Domestic Science have thoroughU' 
tested and in some instances revised the recipes, so that in the new 
edition we offer the I^erfect Cook Book. The following pages are 
selected at random : 

Fish Salad 

Some cold cooked fish 3 pickled gherkins 

1 lettuce 1 slice of cooked beet 

3 tablespoons olive oil Bee Brand pepper and salt 

1 tablespoon vinegar Few grains of Bee Brand ground 

1 hard boiled egg red pepper 

>2 lemon 

Free the fish from bones; separate the pieces into small flakes; 
mix with the lettuce, which must be well washed, wiped, and divided 
into shreds, season with salt, pepper and red pepper. Mix the oil 
and vinegar so that both are well incorporated; then pour over the 
fish and lettuce; mix carefully, and dish up in a pile on a china dish 
or salad bowl. 

Garnish with slices of lemon, sliced gherkins, or other green 
pickles, slices of beet, slices of hard cooked eggs, and some chopped 
parsley.

Quality vs. Purity 



THE enactment of the iNational Pure Food Law in 190b did 
much toward awakening an interest in the purity of Foods 
and Drugs, and while it has been beneficial in a general way, 
it has had its disadxantages because it is not complete. 

The people have been taught h\ the laws and the Pure Food propa- 
gandists to belie\'e that the word "Pure" upon a package ensures that 
its contents are all right. Nothing can be further from the truth. 

An article may be Pure and yet be of very Poor Quality; Purity 
means little. Quality means much. For instance, a Keifer pear is a 
Pure pear, yet in Quality it cannot be compared to the Bartlett pear. 
Consider the difference in the quality of butter. Take a number of 
samples of butter and you will find that some of them will be unfit 
to eat. and others a delight to use, yet they are all Pure butter, and 
the difference is in the Quality. The tobacco in a "five-for-a-nickel" 
stogie may be a Pure tobacco, but it cannot be placed in a class with 
that of an imported Havana cigar selling at twenty-five cents. 

A Spice may be Pure, and yet come fi"om a country known to 
produce inferior Spices. It may be Pure and yet inert. Consider the 
difference in Quality between Acheen Pepper and Tellicherry. They 
are both Pure peppers. 

A Vanilla Flavoring Extract made from rank Tahiti Beans costing 
.fl.50 a pound is a pure Extract of Vanilla, but how does its quality 

compare with that made from high-grade 
Mexican beans, costing $b.00 a pound? 
So it goes all down the line. 

The time is coming when consumers 
will realize that the important thing to 
look for in the purchasing of foodstuffs 
is not the word "Pure ' — but the name 
of the reputable manufacturer whose 
dealings are beyond reproach.

Banquet Brand Tea 



IN this big drum all

from Banquet Tea. 

its a \acuum pro- 
cess, and it acts in such 
a way as to thoroughly 
mix and blend the Teas 
when two or more are 
worked together. 

[here are few Tea 
houses similarly equip- 
ped. Among the 2000 
flavors in Tea, the prob- 
lem of selection and 
combining is big. It 
takes expert knowledge to pi'oduce a Tea like Banquet Blend. 
b^our successive generations of Tea experts produced the man who 
weened Banquet Blend from among the many fla\ors. 

Teas from the highlands of Ceylon, from the interior of China 
and from the hillsides of Japan — all blended in one masteiful creation 
— the triumph of the tea-blender's art. 

In Banquet Blend there is a delicacy of flavor, a lichness of 
lx)uquet, a certain subtle softness, and none of that rankness which 
is found in so man\' brands of tea.

Bee Brand Extracts 

There are few houses engaged in the manufacture of I^lavoring 
Extracts which ha\ e at their disposal a laboratory such as this. 
Early in their busi- 



ness career McCormick 
& Company realized 
that eternal \igilance in 
extract making would 
be the keynote of suc- 
cess. 

The services of ex- 
pert chemists were 
engaged, a modern lab- 
oratory equipped and 
the work of producing 
the world's finest fIa\ors 
begun. The task was not 
easy, nor has the ex- 
pense been light, but

today, and for a number 
of years past, these 
pioneers in the field of 
purer foodstuffs have 
been reaping the har- 
vp'^t of seed sown years 
ago. 

During the two 
years which are required 
to "process" most Bee 
Brand Flavoring Ex- 
tracts the goods are 
sealed in big white oak 
casks, where much of 
their characteristic mel- 
lowness is acquired. 

The making of f^lavoring Extracts has long since been reduced to 
a science, or, if you prefer, elevated to the station of an art. For 
t\\enty-fi\e years the manufacturers of Bee Brand Flavoring Ex- 
tracts have been the first to experiment with whatever innovations 
which have offered for the betterment of the trade. In spite of 
many experiments, the changes ha\e not been drastic — the process 
remains much the same. 




Bee Brand Spices 

The rows of spice-mills, illustrated on page 5, are always of 
interest to the guest. Long before one comes to the spice department 
the fragrant pungent aroma drifts out in friendly greeting. Big 
elcctiically-driven mills pound away hour after hour, day after day, 
turning out savory Bee Brand Spices to tempt the fkd^le appetite 
ot a busy work-a-day world. 

In this building one finds the products of the four corners of the 
globe. It is, indeed, easy to understand Sheba's tribute to Solomon 
when she selected spices from among all the good things the world 
affords and sent them to his court. 

Here is the atmosphere of the Old World mingled w ith the com- 
mercialism of the New. 



A cordial invitation is extended you to visit the Bee Brand Plant 
when you are in Baltimore. Courteous guides are at your disposal 
from 10 A. M. to 4 p. m. each day. Every nook and corner of this 
great institution is open for your inspection — there is nothing under 
cover, nothing to conceal. 

The management wants you personall>- to see the sanitary manner 
in which the plant is run — the smiling faces of contented employees, 
who find their pleasure in their work. No note of discord here! Oc- 
casionally a "kicker" drifts in, but not for long. He has no place 
in "the spirit of the hive."

That's What 6000 Chefs and Stewards Say ! 

These chefs and stewards are members of the hitcrnational 
Mutual Cooks and Pastry Cooks Association, and they have un- 
reservedly endorsed Bee Brand Fla\oring Extracts as the highest in 
quality. 

They don't guess at it — the\' know! The>' ha\e tried and tested 
them in comparison with all other brands of extracts worthy of an\- 
consideration at all. There was onh' one possible \erdict ' Bee Brand 
was found superior in mellowness of fla\or, in qualit\- of ingredients; 
in fact, in evei-y way. 

In the kitchen. Bee Brand Exti-acts were found to cook out less 
readilv than any other extract an^l to impart a finer fruit f1a\or than 
could be secured in any other wa>'. 

This is as it should be. Bee Brand Extracts are the perfected 
result of twenty-five years' experience in scientific Extract Making. 
The highest quality raw materials are used e.\clusivel\- and alter 
intensive processing. Bee Brand Extracts are aged in white oak 
casks to bring out their distinctive mellowness of flavor. 

Bee Brand Extracts were awarded the only Gold Medal at the 
Jamestown Exposition and have been endorsed by "Good House- 
keeping Magazine." Westfield Board of Health and the highest 
authorities in Domestic Science.
