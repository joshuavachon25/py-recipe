Publishers' PREFAeR 



IN presenting to the public the "White Honee Cook Book," the publishers 
believe they can justly claim that it more fully represents the progress and pres- 
ent perfection of the culinary art than any previous worL In point of authorship, 
it stands pre-eminent Hugo Ziemann was at one time caterer for that Prince 
Napoleon who was killed while fighting the Zulus in Africa. He was afterwards 
steward of the famous Hotel Splendide in Paris. Later he coniaucted the cele- 
brated Brunswick Cafe in New York, and still later he gave to the Hotel Bichelieu, 
in Chicago, a cuisine which won the applause of even the gourmets of foreign 
lands. It was here that he laid the famous " spread " to which the chiefs of the 
warring factions of the Eepublican Convention sat down in June, 1888, and from 
which they arose with asperities softened, differences harmonized, and victory 
organized. 

Mr& F. L. GiUette is no less proficient and capable, having made a life-long 
and thorough study of cookery and housekeeping, especially as adapted to the prac- 
tical wants of average American homes. 

The book has been prepared with great care. Every recipe has been tried 
and tested, and can be relied upon as one of the best of its kind. It is comprehen- 
sive, filling completely, it is believed, the requirements of housekeepers of all classes.' 
It embodies several original and commendable features, among which may be 
mentioned the menus for the holidays and for one week in each month in the year, 
thus covering all varieties of seasonable foods; the convenient classification and 
arrangement of topics ; the simplified method of explanation in preparing an article, 
in the order of manipidation, thereby enabling the most inexperienced to clearly 
comprehend it. 

The subject of carving has been given a prominent place, not only because of 
its special importance in a work of this kind, but particidarly because it contains 
entirely new and original designs, and is so far a departure from the usual mode of 
treating the subject. 

Interesting information is given concerning the White House; how its hospi- 
tality is conducted, the menus served on special occasions, views of the interior, 
portraits of all the ladies of the White House, etc. 

Convenience has been studied in the make-up of the book. The type is large 
and plain ; it is sewed by patent flexible process^,BO that when opened it will not 
close of itself, and it is bound in enameled cloth^ adapted for use in the kitchen.

CARVING. 

Carving is one important acquisition in the routine of daily living, and all 
should try to attain a knowledge or ability to do it well, and withal gracefully. 

When carving tise a chair slightly higher than the ordinary size, as it gives 
a better purchase on the meat, and appears more' graceful than when standing, 
as is often quite necessary when carving a turkey, or a very large joint. More 
depends on skill than strength. The platter should be placed opposite, and 
sufficiently near to give perfect command of the article to be carved, the knife 
of medium size, sharp with a keen edge. Commence by cutting the slices thin, 
laying them carefully to one side of the platter, then afterwards placing the 
desired amount on each guest's plate, to be served in turn by the servant. 

In carving fish, care should be taken to help it in perfect flakes; for if these 
are broken the beauty of the fish is lost. The carver should acquaint himself 
with the choicest parts and morsels; and to give each guest an equal share of 
those tidbits should be his maxim. Steel knives and forks should on no account 
be used in helping fish, as these are hable to impart a very disagreeable flavor, 
A fish-trowel of silver or plated silver is the proper article to use. 

Gravies should be sent to the table very hot, and in helping one to gravy or 
melted butter, place it on a vacant side of the plate; not pour it over their meat, 
fish or fowl, that they may use only as much as they like. 

When serving fowls, or meat, accompanied with stuffing, the guests should 
be asked if they would have a portion, as it is not every one to whom the flavor 
of stuffing is agreeable; in filling their plates, avoid heaping one thing upon 
another, as it makes a bad appearance. 

A word about the care of carving knives: a flne steel knife should not come in 
contact with intense heat, because it destroys its temper, and therefore impairs 
its cutting qualities. Table carving knives should not be used in the kitchen, 
either around the stove, or for cutting bread, meats, vegetables, etc.; a flne 
whetstone should be kept for sharpening, and the knife cleaned carefully to 
avoid dulling its edge, aU of which is quite essential to successful carving.

VEAL. 




VEAL. 



Hind-Quarter. 



No. 1. Loin, the choicest cuts used for roasts and chops. 

No. 2. Fillet, used for roasts and cutlets. 

No. 3. Loin, chump-end used for roasts and chops. 

No. 4. The hind-knuckle or hock, used for stews, pot-pies, meat-pie& 



FORB-QXTABTER. 

No. 5. Neck, best end used for roasts, stews and chops. 
No. 6. Breast, best end used for roasting, stews and chops. 
No. 7. Blade-bone, used for pot-roasts and baked dishes. 
No. 8. Fore-knuckle, used for soups and stews. 
No. 9. Breast, brisket-end used for baking, stews and pot-pies. 
No. 10. Neck, scrag-end used for stews, broth, meat-pies, etc. 

In cutting up veal, generally, the hind-quarter is divided in loin and leg, and 
the fore-quarter into breast, neck and shoulder. 

The, Several Parts of a Moderately-sized, well-fed Calf, about eight weebj 
old, are nearly of the following weights: — Loin and chump, 18 lbs; fillet, 12i lbs. 
hind knuckle, 5i lbs. ; shovdder, 11 lbs. ; neck, 11 lbs. ; breast, 9 lbs. ; and foi^ 
knuckle, 5 lbs. ; making a total of 144 lbs. weight. 



MUTTON. 




MUTTON. 



No. 1. Leg, used for roasts and for boiling. 

No. 2. Shoulder, used for baked dishes and roaats. 

No. 3. Loin, best end used for roasts, chops. 

No. 4. Loin, chump end used for roasts and chops. 

No. 5. Eack, or rib chops, used foi French chops, rib chops, either for trying or 

broihng; also used for choice stews. 
No. 6. Breast, used for roast, baked dishes, stews, chops. 
No. 7. Neck or scrag end, used for cutlets and stews and meat pies. 

Note. — A saddle of mutton or double loin is two loins cut off before the car- 
case is split open down the back. EYench chops are a small rib chop, the end of 
the bone trinuned off and the meat and fat cut away from the thin end, leaving 
the round piece of meat attached to the larger end, which leaves the small rib- 
bone bare. Very tender and sweet. 

Mutton is prime when cut from a carcase which has been fed out of doors, 
and allowed to run upon the hillside; they are best when about three years old. 
The fat will then be abundant, white and hard, the flesh juicy and firm, and of 
a dear red color. 

For mutton roasts, choose the shoulder, the saddle, or the loin or haunch. 
The leg should be boiled. Almost any part wiU do for broth. 

Lamb bom in the middle of the winter, reared under shelter, and fed in a 
great measure upon milk, then killed in the spring, is considered a great delicacy, 
though lamb is good at a year old. Like all young animals, lamb ought to be 
thoroughly cooked^ or it is most unwholesome. 



PORK. 




PORK. 

No. 1. Leg, used for smoked hams, roasts and corned pork. 

No. 2. Hind-loin, used for roasts, chops and baked dishes. 

No. 3. Fore-lo^i or ribs, used for roasts, baked dishes or chops. 

No. 4. Spare-rib, used for roasts, chops, stewe. 

No. 5. Shoulder, used for smoked shoulder, roasts and corned pork. 

No. 6. Brisket and flank, used for pickling in salt, and smoked bacon. 

The cheek is used for pickling in salt, also the shank or shin. The feet aw^ 
usually used for souse and jelly. 

For family use, the leg is the most economical, that is when fresh, and the 
loin the richest. The best pork is from carcases weighing from fifty to about 
one hundred and twenty-five pounds. Pork is a white and close meat, and it 
is almost impossible to over-roast pork or cook it too much; when underdone it 
is exceedingly unwholesome. 




VENISOHr 




VENISON. 

No. 1. Shoulder, used for roasting; it may be boned and stuffed, then afterwards 

baked or roasted. 
No. 2. Fore-loin, used for roasts and steaks. 
No. 3. Haunch or loin, used for roasts, steaks, stews. The ribs cut close may be 

used for soups. Good for pickling and making into smoked venison. 
No. 4. Breast, used for baking dishes, stewing. 
No. 5. Scrag or neck, used for soups. 

The choice of venison should be judged by the fat, which, when the venison 
is young, should be thick, clear and close, and the meat a very dark red. The 
flesh of a female deer, about four years old, is the sweetest and best of venison. 

Buck venison, which is in season from Jxme to the end of September, is finer 
than doe venison, which is in season from October to December. Neither should 
be dressed at any other time of year, and no meat requires so much care as 
venison in killing, preserving, and dressing. 



SIRLOIN OF BEEF. 




SIRLOIN OF, BEEF. 



This choice roasting-piece should be cut with one good firm stroke from end 
to end of the joint, at the upper part, in thin, long, even shoes in the direction 
of the hne fcgm,! to 2, cutting across the grain, serving each guest with some 
of the fat with the lean; this may be done by cutting a small thin shoe from 
underneath the bone from 5 to 6, through the tenderloin. 

Another way of carving this piece, and which will be of great assistance in 
doing it well, is to ins(Brt the knife just above the bone at the bottom, and run 
sharply along, dividing the meat from tip bone at the bottom and end, thus leav- 
ing it perfectly flat; then carve in long, thin shoes the usual way. When the 
bone has been removed and the sirloin rolled before it is dooked, it is laid upon 
the platt^ on one end, and an even, thin slice is carved across the grain of the 
up;^rs^ace. ,- ■"'^if •':. ■''!'■. -s^ _ - 

Koast ribs should be carved in thin, even sUces from the thick end towards 
the thin in the same manner as the sirloin; this can be more easily and cleanly 
done if the carving knife is first run along between the meat and the end and 
rib-bones, thus leaving it free from bone to be cut into shces. 

Tongue. — To carve this, it should be cut crosswise, the middle being the best; 
cut in very tMn shoes, thereby improving its dehcacy, making it more tempting; 
as is the case of all well-carved meats. The root of the tongue is usually left 
on the platter. 



BREAST OF VEAL. 




BREAST OF VEAL. 

This piece is quite similar to a fore-quarter of lamb afte]||the shoulder has 
been taken off. A breast of veal consists of two parts, thf rib-bones and the , 
gristly brisket. These parts may be separated by sharply passing the carving 
knife in the direction of the Une from 1 to 2; and when they are entirely divided, 
the rib bones should be carved in the direction of the Une from 6 to 6, and the 
brisket can be helped by cutting slices from 3 to 4. 

The carver should ask the guests whether they have a preference for the 
brisket or ribs; and if there be a sweetbread served with the dish, as is fre- 
quently with this roast of veal, each person should receive a piece. - 

Though veal and lamb contain less nutrition than beef and mutton, in pro- 
portion to their weight, they are often preferred to these latter meats on account 
of their dehcacy of texture and flavor. A whole breast of veal weighs from nine 
to twelve pounds. 




«« 



A FILLET OF VEAL. 




A FILLET OF VEAL. 



A fillet of veal is one of the prime roasts of veal; it is taken from the leg above 
the knuckle; a piece weighing from ten to twelve pounds is a good size aiKl 
requires about four hours for roasting. Before roasting, it is dressed with a 
force meat or stufflng placed in the cavity from where the bone was taken out 
and the flap tightly secured together with skewers; many bind it together with 
tape. 

To carve it, cut in even thin slices off from the whole of the upper part or 
top, in the same manner as from a roUed roast of beef, as in the direction of 
the figures 1 and 2; this gives the person sei-ved some of the dressing with each 
slice of meat. 

Veal is very unwholesome unless it is cooked thoroughly, and when roasted 
should be of a rich brown color. Bacon, fried pork, sausage-balls, with greens 
are among the accompaniments of roasted veal, also a cut lemon. 



NECK OF VEAL. 



II 




NECK OF VEAL. 



The best end of a neck of veal makes a very good roasting-piece; it however 
js composed of bone and ribs that make it quite difficult to carve, unless it is 
done properly. To attempt to carve each chop and serve it, you would not only 
place too large a piece upon the plate of the person you intend to serve; but you 
would waste much time, and should the vertebrae have not been removed by the 
butcher, you would be compelled to exercise such a degree of strength that 
would make one's appearance very ungraceful, and possibly, too, throwing gravy 
over your neighbor sitting next to you. The correct way to carve this roast is 
to cut diagonally from figure 1 to 2, and help in shces of moderate thickness; 
then it may be cut from 3 to 4, in order to separate the small bones; divide anc! 
serve them, having first inquired if they are desired. 

This joint is usually sent to the table accompanied by bacon, ham, tongue, or 
pickled pork on a separate dish and with a cut lemon on a plate. There are also 
a number of sauces that are suitable with this roast. 



IS 



LEG OF MUTTOJSr. 




LEG OF MUTTON. 



The best mutton, and that from which most nomishment is obtained, is that 
w^ sheep from three to six years old, and which have been fed on dry sweet 
pastures; then mutton is in its prime, the flesh being firm, juicy, dark colored, 
and fuU of the richest gravy. When mutton is two years old, the meat is 
flabby, pale and savorless. 

In carving a roasted leg, the best shces are found by cutting quite down to 
the bone, in the direction from 1 to 2, and slices may be taken from either side. 

Some very good cuts are taken from the broad end from 5 to 6, and the fat 
on this ridge is very much Kked by many. The cramp-bone is a dehcacy, and is 
obtained by cutting down to the bone at 4, and running the knife xmder it in 
a semicircular direction to 3. The nearer the knuckle the drier the meat, but the 
under side contains the most finely grained meat, from which shces may be cut 
lengthwise. When sent to the table a friU of paper around the knuckle will im- 
prove its appearance. 



FORE-QUARTER OF LAMB. 



13 




FORE-QUARTER OF LAMB. 

The first cut to be made in carving a fore-quarter of lamb is to separate the 
shoulder from the breast and ribs; this is done by passing a sharp carving knife 
lightly around the dotted Itue as shown by the figures 3, 4, and 5, so as to cut 
through the skin, and then, by raising with a little force the shoulder, into 
which the fork should be firmly fixed, it will easily separate with just a Uttle 
more cutting with the knife; care should be taken not to cut away too much of 
the meat from the breast when dividing the shoulder from it, as that would mar 
its appearance. The shoulder may be placed upon a separate dish for con- 
venience. The next process is to divide the ribs from the brisket by cutting 
through the meat in the hne from 1 to 2; then the ribs may be carved in the 
direction of the hne 6 to 7, and the brisket from 8 to 9. The carver should 
always ascertain whether the guest prefers ribs, brisket or a piece of the shoulder™ 




H 



HAM. 




HAM. 
The carver in cutting a ham must be guided according as he desires to prac- 
tise economy, or have at once fine shoes out of the prime part. Under the first 
supposition, he will commence at the knuckle end, and cut off thin shoes towards 
the thick and upper part of the ham. 

To reach the choicer portion of the ham, the knife, which must be very sharp 
and thin, should be carried quite down to the bone through the thick fat in the 
direction of the Une, from 1 to 2. The shoes should be even and thin, cuttiag 
both lean and fat together, always cutting down to the bone. Some cut a circu- 
lar hole in the middle of a ham gradually enlarging it outwardly. Then again 
many carve a ham by first cutting from 1 to 2, then across.the other way from 
3 to 4. Eemove the skin after the ham is cooked and send to the table with 
dots of dry pepper or dry mustard on the top, a tuft of fringed paper twisted 
about the knuckle, and plenty of fresh parsley around the dish. This will always 
ensure an inviting appearance. 

Boast Pig. — The modem way of serving a pig is not to send it to the table 
whole, but have it carved partially by the cook; first, by dividing the shoulder 
from the body; then the leg in the same manner; also separating the ribs into 
convenient portions. The head may be divided and placed on the same plat- 
ter. To be served as hot as possible. 

A Spare Rib of Pork is carved by cutting shoes from the fleshy part, after 
which the bones should be disjointed and separated. 

A leg of pork may be carved in the same manner as a ham. 



HAUNCH OF VENISON. 



15 




HAUNCH OF VENISON. 

A haunch of venison is the prime joint, and is carved very similar to ahnost 
any roasted or boUed leg; it should be first cut crosswise down to the bone fol- 
lowing the line from 1 to 2; then turn the platter with the knuckle farthest 
from you, put in the point of the knife, and cut down as far as you can, in the 
directions shown by the dotted lines from 3 to 4 then there can; be taken out as 
many shoes as is required on the right and left of this. Shoes of venison should 
be cut thin, and gravy given with them, but as there is a special sauce made 
with red wine and currant jeUy to accompany this meat, do not serve gravy 
before asking the guest if he pleases to have any. 

The fat of this meat is hke mutton, apt to cool soon, and become hard and 
disagreeable to the palate; it should therefore be served always on warm plates, 
and the platter kept over a hot- water dish, or spirit lamp. Many cooks dish it 
up with a white paper friU pitied aroimd the knuckle-bone. 

A hatmch of mutton is carved the same as a haunch of venison. 




t6 



TURKEY. 




TURKEY. 

A tur] ey having been relieved from strings and skewers used in trussing 
should be placed on the table with the head or neck at the carver's right hand. 
An expert carver places the fork ia the turkey, and does not remove it untU the 
whole is divided. First insert the fork firmly in the lower part of the breast, 
just forward of fig. 2, then sever the legs aad wings on both sides, if the whole 
is to be carved, cutting neatly through the joint next to the body, letting these 
parts he on the platter. Next, cut downward from the breast from 2 to 3, as 
many even shces of the white meat as may be desired, placing the pieces neatly 
on one side of the platter. Now unjoint the legs and wings at the middle joint, 
which can be done very skillfully by a httle practice. Make an opening into the 
cavity of the turkey for dipping out the inside dressing, by cutting a piece from 
the rear part 1, 1, called the apron. Consult the tastes of the guests as to which 
part is preferred; if no choice is expressed, serve a portion of both Ught and dark 
meat. One of the most deUcate parts of the turkey, are two little muscles, ly- j 
ing in small dish-hke cavities on each side of the back, a little behind the leg 
attachments; the next most delicate meat fills the cavities in the neck bone, and 
next to this, that on the second joints. The lower part of the leg (or drum- 
stick, as it is called) being hard, tough, and stringy is rarely ever helped to any 
one, but allowed to remain on the dish. 



ROAST GOOSE— FO WLS. 1 7 





ROAST GOOSE. 

To carve a goose, first begin by separating the leg from the body, by putting 
the fork into the small end of the limb, pressing it closely to the body, then 
passing the knife under at 2, and tm-ning the leg back as you cut through the 
joint. To take off the wing, insert the fork in the small end of the pinion, and 
press it close to the body; put the knife in at figure 1, and divide the joint. 
When the legs and wings are off, the breast may be carved in long even sUces, 
as represented in the hues from 1 to 2. The back and lower side bones, as well 
as the two lower side bones by the wing, may be cut off; but the best pieces of 
the goose are the breast and thighs, after being separated from the drum-sticks. 
Serve a httle of the dressing from the inside, by making a circvdar shce in the 
apron at figure 3. A goose should never be over a year old; a tough goose is 
very difficidt to carve, and certainly most difficult to eat. 

FOWLS. 

First insert the knife between the leg and the body, and cut to the bone; 
then turn the leg back with the fork, and if the fowl is tender the joint will give 
away easily. The wing is broken off the same way, only dividing the joint with 
the knife, in the direction from 1 to 2. The four quarters having been removed 
in this way, take off the merry-thought and the neck-bones; these last are to be 
removed by putting the knife in at figure 3 and 4, pressing it hard, when they 
wiU break off from the part that sticks to the breast. To separate the breast 
from the body of the fowl, cut through the tender ribs close to the breast, quite 
down to the tail. Now turn the fowl over, back upwards; put the knife into 
the bone midway between the neck and the rump, and on raising the lower end 
it wiU separate readily. Turn now the rump from you, and take off very neatly 
the two side-bones and the fowl is carved. In separating the thigh from the 
^irum-8tick, the knife must be inserted exactly at the joint, for if not accurately 
hit, some difficulty will be experienced to get them apart; this is easily acquired 
by practice. There is no difference in carving roast and boiled fowls if fuU 
grown; but in very young fowls, the breast is usually served whole; the wings 
and breast are considered the best part, but in young ones the legs are the most 
juicy. In the case of a capon or large fowl, slices may be cut off at the breast, 
the same as carving a pheasant.

ROAST DUCK— PARTRIDGES. 





ROAST DUCK. 

A young duckling may be carved in the same manner as a fowl, the legs and 
wings being taken off first on either side. When the duck is full size, carve it 
like a goose; first cutting it in slices from the breast, beginning close to the 
wing and proceeding upward towards the breast bone, as is represented by the 
lines 1 to 2. An opening may be made, by cutting out a circidar shoe as shown 
by the dotted lines at number 3. 

Some are fond of the feet, and when dressing the duck, these should be 
neatly skinned and never removed. Wild duck is highly esteemed by epicures; 
it is trussed hke a tame duck, and carved in the same manner, the breast being 
the choicest part. 

PARTRIDGES. 

Partridges are generally cleaned and trussed the same way as a pheasant, but 
the custom of cooking them with the heads on is going into disuse somewhat. 
The usual way of carving them is similar to a pigeon, dividing it into two equal 
parts. Another method is to cut it into three pieces, by severing a wing and 
leg on either side from the body, by following the lines 1 to 2, thus making two 
servings of those parts, leaving the breast for a third plate. The third method 
is to thrust back the body from the legs, and cut through the middle of the 
breast, thus making foiu" portions that may be served. Grouse and prairie- 
chicken are carved from the breast when they are large, and quartered or 
halved when of medium size. 




PHEASANT— PIGEONS. 



^9 




PHEASANT. 

Place yoiir fork firmly in the centre of the breast of this large game bird and 
cut deep slices to the bone at figures 1 and 2; then take off the leg in the line 
from 3 and 4 and the wing 3 and 5, severing both sides the same. In taking off 
the wings, be careful not to cut too near the neck; if you do you will hit upon 
the neck-bone, from which the wing must be separated. Pass the knife through 
the line 6, and under the merry-thought towards the neck, which will detach it. 
Cut the other parts as in a fowl. The breast, wings, and merry-thought of a 
pheasant, are the most highly prized, although the legs are considered very 
finely fiavored. Pheasants are frequently roasted with the bead left on; in that 
case, when dressing them, biiog the head round under the wing, and fix it on the 
point of a skewer. 

PIGEONS. 

A very good way of carving these birds is to insert the knife at figure 1, and 
cut both ways to 2 and 3, when each portion may be divided into two pieces, 
then served. Pigeons, if not too large, may be cut in halves, either across or 
down the middle, cutting them into two equal parts; if young and smaU they 
may be served entirely whole. 

Tame pigeons should be cooked as soon as possible after they are killed, as 
they very quickly lose their flavor. Wild pigeons, on the contrary, shoiild hang 
a day or two in a cool place before they are dressed. Oranges cut into halves 
are used as a garnish for dishes of small birds, such as pigeons, quails, woodcock, 
squabs, snipe, etc. These small birds are either served whole or spht down the 
back, making two servings.

MACKEREL— BOILED SALMON. 





MACKEREL. 

The mackerel is one of the most beautiful of fish, being known by their 
silvery whiteness. It sometimes attains to the length of twenty inches, but 
usually, when fially grown, is about fourteen or sixteen inches long, and about 
two pounds in weight. To carve a baked mackerel, first remove the head and 
tail by cutting downward at 1 and 2; then split them down the back, so as 
to serve each person a part of each side piece. The roe should be divided in 
small pieces and served with each piece of fish. Other whole fish may be carved 
in the same manner. The fish is laid upon a little sauce or folded napkin, on 
a hot dish, and garnished with parsley. 

BOILED SALMON. 

This fish is seldom sent to the table whole, being too large for any ordinary 
sized family; the middle cut is considered the choicest to boil. To carve it, first 
run the knife down and along the upper side of the fish from 1 to 2, then again 
on the lower side from 3 to 4. Serve the thick part, cutting it lengthwise in 
slices in the direction of the line from 1 to 2, and the thin part breadthwise, or 
in the direction from 5 to 6. A sUce of the thick with one of the thin, where 
lies the fat, should be served to each guest. Care should be taken when carv- 
ing not to break the flakes of the fish, as that impairs its appearance. The 
flesh of the salmon is rich and dehcious in flavor. Salmon is in season 
lirom the first of February to the end of August. 





Consomme, or Stock, forms the basis of all meat soups, and also of all princL 
pal sauces. It is, therefore, essential to the success of these culinary operations 
to know the most complete and economical method of extracting from a certain 
quantity of meat the best possible stock or broth. Fresh uncooked beef makes 
the best stock, with the addition of cracked bones, as the glutinous matter con- 
tained in them renders it important that they should be boiled with the meat, 
which adds to the strength and thickness of the soup. They are composed of 
an earthy substance — to which they owe their soUdity — of gelatine, and a fatty 
fluid, something like marrow. Two ounces of them contain as much gelatine 
as one pound of meat; but ia them, this is so encased in the earthy substance, 
that boiling water can dissolve only the surface of the whole bones, but by 
breaking them they can be dissolved more. When there is an abundance of it, 
it causes the stock, when cold, to become a jeUy. The flesh of old animals 
contains more flavor than the flesh of young ones. Brown meats contain more 
flavor than white. 

Mutton is too strong in flavor for good stock, while veal, although quite 
glutinous, fmmishes very httle nutriment. 

Some cooks use meat that has once been cooked; this renders httle nourish- 
ment and destroys the flavor. It might answer for ready soup, but for stock to 
keep it is not as good, unless it should be roasted meats. Those contain higher 
fragrant properties; so by putting the remains of roast meats in the stock-pot 
you obtain a better flavor. 

The shin bone is generally used, but the neck or "sticking piece," as the 
butchers call it, contains more of the substance that you want to extract, makes 
a stronger and more nutritious soup, than any other part of the animal. Meats 
for soup should always be put on to cook in cold water, in a covered pot, and 
allowed to simmer slowly for several hom-s, in order that the essence of the 
meat may be drawn out thoroughly, and should be carefully skimmed to pre- 



22 SOUJ^S. 

vent it from becoming tm-bid, never allowed to boil fast at any time, and if more 
water is needed, use boiling water from the tea-kettle; cold or lukewarm water 
spoils the flavor. Never salt it before the meat is tender (as that hardens and 
toughens the meat), especially if the meat is to be eaten. Take off every parti- 
cle of scum as it rises, and before the vegetables are put in. 

AHow a httle less than a quart of water to a pound of meat and bone, and a 
teaspoonful of salt. When done, strain through a colander. If for clear soups 
strain again through a hair sieve, or fold a clean towel in a colander set over 
an earthen bowl, or any dish large fenough to hold the stock. As stated before, 
stock is not as good when made entirely from cooked meats, but in a family 
where it requires a large joint roasted every day, the bones and bits and under- 
done pieces of beef, or the bony structure of turkey or chicken that has been 
left from carving, bones of roasted poultry, these all assist in imparting a rich 
dark color to soup, and would be suflicient, if stewed as above, to furnish a 
family, without buying fresh meat for the purpose; still, with the addition of a 
httle fresh meat it would be more nutritious. In cold weather you can gather 
them up for several days and put them to cook in cold water, and when done, 
strain, and put aside until needed. 

Soup will be as good the second day as the first if heated to the boiling 
point. It should never be left in the pot, but should be turned into a dish or 
shallow pan, and set aside to get cold. Never cover it up, as that wiU cause it 
to turn sour very quickly. 

Before heating a second time, remove aU the fat from the top. If this be 
melted in, the flavor of the soup wfll certainly be spoiled. 

Thickened soups require nearly double the seasoning used for thin soups or 
broth. 

Coloring is used in some brown soups, the chief of which is brown bmut 
sugar, which is known as caramel by French cooks. 

Pounded spinach leaves give a fine green color to soup. Parsley, or the 
green leaves of celery, put in soup wiU serve instead of spinach. 

Pound a large handful of spinach in a mortar, then tie it in a cloth, and 
wring out aU the juice; put this in the soup you wish to color green, five min- 
utes before taking it up. 

Mock turtle, and sometimes veal and lamb soups, should be this color. 

Ochras gives a green color to soup. 

To color soup red, skin six red tomatoes, squeeze out the seeds and put them 
into the soup with the other vegetables— or take the juice only as directed for 
spinach. 



SOUPS. 23 

For white soups, which are of veal, lamb or chicken, none but white vegeta- 
bles are used; rice, pearl barley, vermicelli, or macaroni for thickening. 

Grated carrot gives a fine amber color to soup; it must be put in as soon as 
the soup is free from scum. 

Hotel and private-house stock is quite different. 

Hotels use meat in such large quantities, that there is always more or 
less trimmings and bones of meat to add to fresh meats; that makes very 
strong stock, which they use in most all soups and gravies and other made 
dishes. 

The meat from which soup has been made is good to serve cold thus: take 
out aU the bones, season with pepper and salt, and catsup, if liked, then chop 
it small, tie it in a cloth, and lay it between two plates, with a weight on the 
upper one: shoe it thin for luncheon or supper; or make sandwiches of it; or 
make a hash for breakfast; or make it into balls, with the addition of a Uttle 
wheat flour and an egg, and serve them fried in fat, or boil in the soup. 

An agreeable flavor is sometimes imparted to soup by sticking some cloves 
into the meat used for making stock; a few sHces of onions fried very brown 
in butter are nice; also flour browned by simply putting it into a saucepan over 
the fire and stirring it constantly until it is a dark brown. 

Clear soups must be perfectly transparent and thickened soups about thf> 
consistence of cream. When soups and gravies are kept from day to day in hot 
weather, they should be warmed up every day, and put into fresh-scalded pans 
or tureens, and placed in a cool cellar. In temperate weather, every other day 
may be sufficient. 

HERBS AND VEGETABLES USED IN SOUPS. 

Of vegetables the principal ones are carrots, tomatoes, asparagus, green peas, 
okra, macaroni, green com, beans, rice, vermicelli, Scotch barley, pearl barley, 
wheat flour, mushroom or mushroom catsup, parsnips, beet-root, turnips, leeks, 
garUc, shalots and onions; sliced onions fried with butter and flour until they 
are browned, then rubbed through a sieve, are excellent to heighten the color and 
flavor of brown sauces and soups. The herbs usually used in soups are parsley, 
common thyme, smnmer savory, knotted marjoram, and other seasonings such 
as bay-leaves, tarragon, allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, mace, black and 
white pepper, red pepper, lemon-peel and juice, orange peel and juice. The 
latter imparts a finer flavor and the acid much milder. These materials, with 
wme, and the various catsups, combined in various proportions, are, with other 
'ngredients, made into almost an endless variety of excellent soups and gravies. 



H SOUPS. 



Soups that are intended for the principal part of a meal certainly ought not to 
be flavored like sauces, which are only intended to give relish to some particular 



dish 



STOCK. 



Six pounds of shin of beef, or six pounds of knuckle of veal; any bones, trim- 
mings of poultry, or fresh meat; one-quarter pound of lean bacon or ham, two 
ounces of butter, two large onions, each stuck with cloves; one turnip, three 
carrots, one head of celery, two ounces of salt, one -half teaspoonful of whole 
pepper, one large blade of mace, one bimch of savory herbs except sage, four 
quarts and one-half pint of cold water. 

Cut up the meat and bacon, or ham, into pieces of about three inches 
square; break the bones into small pieces, rub the butter on the bottom of the 
stewpan; put in one-half a pint of water, the broken bones, then meat and aU. 
other ingredients. Cover the stewpan, and place it on a sharp fire, occasionally 
stirring its contents. When the bottom of the pan becomes covered with a pale, 
jelly-hke substance, add the four quarts of cold water, and simmer very gently 
for five or six hours. As we have said before, do not let it boil quickly. When 
nearly cooked, throw in a tablespoonful of salt to assist the scum to rise. Ee- 
move every particle of scmn whilst it is doing, and strain it through a fine hair 
sieve; when cool remove all grease. This stock will keep for many days in cold 
weather. ' 

Stock is the basis of many of the soups afterwards mentioned, and this wiU 
be foimd quite strong enough for ordinary purposes. Keep it in small jars, in a 
cool place. It makes a good gravy for hash meats; one tablespoonful of it is 
sufficient to impart a fine flavor to a dish of macaroni and various other dishes. 
Good soups of various kinds are made from it at short notice; sUce off a portion 
of the jelly, add water, and whatever vegetables and thickening preferred. It is 
best to partly cook the vegetables before adding to the stock, as much boiling 
injures the flavoring of the soup. Season and boil a few moments and serve 
hot. 

WHITE STOCK. 

White stock is used ia the preparation of white soups, and is made by boil- 
ing six pounds of a knuckle of veal, cut up in small pieces, poultry trinunings, 
and four shces of lean ham. Proceed according to directions given in " Stock, '" 
above. 



SOUFS. 25 

TO CLARIFY STOCK. 
Place the stock in a clean saucepan, set it over a brisk fire. When boiling, add 
the white of one egg to each quart of stock, proceeding as follows: beat the 
whites of the eggs up well in a Uttle water; then add a httle hot stock; beat to 
a froth, and pour gradually into the pot; then beat the whole hard and long; 
allow it to boil up once, and immediately remove and strain through a thin flan- 
nel cloth. 

BEEF SOUP. 

Select a small shin of beef of moderate size, crack the bone in small pieces, 
wash and place it in a kettle to boU, with five or six quarts of cold water. Let 
it boU about two hours, or until it begins to get tender, then season it with a 
tablespoonful of salt, and a teaspoonful of pepper; boil it one hour longer, then 
add to it one carrot, two turnips, two tablespoonf uls of rice or pearl barley, one 
head of celery and a teaspoonful of summer savory powdered fine; the vegetables 
to be minced up in small pieces like dice. After these ingredients have boiled 
a quarter of an hour, put in two potatoes cut up in small pieces; let it boil half 
an hour longer, take the meat from the soup, and if intended to be served with 
it, take out the bones and lay it closely and neatly on a dish, and garnish with 
sprigs of parsley. 

Serve made mustard and catsup with it. It is very nice pressed and eaten 
cold with mustard and vinegar, or catsup. Four hours are required for making 
this soup. Should any remain over the first day, it may be heated, with the 
addition of a httle boiUng water, and served again. Some fancy a glass of brown 
sherry added just before being served. Serve very hot. 

VEAL SOUP. (Excellent.) 
Put a knuckle of veal into three quarts of cold water, with a small quantity 
of salt, and one small tablespoonful of uncooked rice. Boil slowly, hardly 
above simmering, four hours, when the hquor should be reduced to half the 
usual quantity; remove from the fire. Into the tvireen put the yolk of one egg, 
and stir well into it a teacupful of cream, or, iii hot weather, new milk;.add a 
piece of butter the size of a hickory-nut; on this strain the soup, boiUng hot, 
stirring all the time. Just at the last, beat it weU for a minute. 

SCOTCH MUTTON BROTH. 
Six pounds neck of mutton, three quarts water, five carrots, five turnips, two 
onions, four tablespoonfuls barley, a little salt. Soak mutton in water for an 



26 SOUFS. 

hour, cut off scrag, and put it in stewpan with three quarts of water. As soon 
as it boils, skim well, and then simmer for one and one-half hours Cut best 
end of mutton into cutlets, dividing it mth two bones in each; take off nearly- 
all fat before you put it into broth; skim the moment the meat boils, and every 
ten minutes afterwards; add carrots, turnips and onions, all cut into two or three 
pieces, then put them into soup soon enough to be thoroughly done; stir in bar- 
ley; add salt to taste; let aU stew together for three and one-half hours: about 
one-half hour before sending it to table, put in little chopped parsley and serve. 

Cut the me^t off the scrag into small pieces, and send it to table in the tureen 
with the soup. The other half of the mutton should be served on a separate 
dish, with whole turnips boiled and laid roimd it. Many persons are fond of 
mutton that has been boUed in soup. 

You may thicken the soup with rice or barley that has first been soaked in 
cold water; or with green peas; or with young com, cut down from the cob; 
or vrith tomatoes scalded, peeled and cut into pieces. 

GAME SOUP. 

Two grouse or partridges, or, if you have neither, use a pair of rabbits; half 
a pound of lean ham; two medium-sized onions; one pound of lean beef; fried 
bread; butter for frying; pepper, salt, and two stalks of white celery cut into 
iuch lengths; three quarts of water. 

Joint your game neatly; cut the ham and onicns into small pieces, and fry 
all in butter to a Ught brown. Put into a soup-pot with the beef, cut into strips, 
and a little pepper. Pour on the water; heat slowly, and stew gently two hoin^. 
Take out the pieces of bird, and cover in a bowl; cook the soup an hoiu- longer; 
strain; cool; drop iu the celery, and simmer ten minutes. Pour upon fried 
bread in the tureen. 

Venison soup made the same, with the addition of a tablespoonful of brown 
flour wet into a paste with cold water, adding a tablespoonful of catsup, Worces- 
tershire, or other pungent sauce, and a glass of Madeira or brown sherry. 

CONSOMME SOUP. 

Take good strong stock (see pages 21 and 24), remove all fat from the surfaca, 
and for each quart of the stock allow the white and shell of one egg and a table- 
spoonful of water, well whipped together. Pour this mixture into a saucepan 
containing the stock ; place it over the fire and heat the contents gradually, stirring 
often to prevent the egg from sticking to the bottom of the saucepan. Allow it to 



SOUFS. 27 

boil gently until the stock looks perfectly clear under the egg, which will rise and 
float upon the surface in the form of a thick white scum. Now remove it and pour 
it into a folded towel laid in a colander set over an earthen bowl, allowing it to run 
through without moving or squeezing it. Season with more salt if needed, and 
quickly serve very hot. This should be a clear ajnber color. 

JULIENNE SOUP. 

Cut carrots and turnips into quarter inch pieces the shape of dice; also celery 
into thin slices. Cover them with boiling water; add a teaspoonful of salt, half a 
teaspoonful pepper, and cook until soft. In another saucepan have two quarts of 
boiling stock (see pages 21 and 24), to which add the cooked vegetables, the water 
and more seasoning if necessary. Serve hot. 

In the spring and summer season use asparagus, peas and string beans — all cut 
into small uniform thickness. 

CREAM OF SPINACH. 

Pick, wash and boil enough spinach to measure a pint; when cooked, chopped 
and pounded into a soft paste. Put it into a stewpan with four ounces of fresh 
butter, a little grated nutmeg, a teaspoonful of salt. Cook and stir it about ten 
minutes. Add to this two quarts of strong stock (see pages 21 and 24) ; let boil up, 
then rub it through a strainer. Set it over the ilre again, and, when on the point of 
boiling, mix with it a tablespoonf ul of butter, t:4> d a teanpoonf ul of granulated sugar. 

CHICKEN CREAM SOUP. 

An old chicken for soup is much the best. Cut it up into quarters, put it 
into a soup kettle with half a pound of corned ham, and an onion; add four 
quarts of cold w^ater. Bring slowly to a gentle boU, and keep this up until the 
Uquid has diminished one-third, and the meat drops from the bones; then add 
half a cup of rice. Season with salt, pepper, and a bunch of chopped parsley. 

Cook slowly until the rice is tender, then the meat should be taken out. 
Now, stir in two cups of rich milk thickened with a Uttle flour. The chicken 
could be fried in a spoonful of butter and a gravy made, reserving some of the 
white part of the meat, chopping it and adding it to the soup. 

PLAIN ECONOMICAL SOUP. 

Take a cold-roast-beef bone, pieces of beef -steak, the rack of a cold turkey or 
chicken. Put them into a pot with three or four quarts of water, two carrots, 
three turnips, one onion, a few cloves, pepper and salt. Boil the whole gently 



2 8 SOUFS. 

fouk hours; then strain it through a colander, mashing the vegetables so tnat 
they will aH pass through. Skim off the fat, and return the soup to the pot. 
Mix one tablespoonful of flour with two of water, stir it into the soup and boil 
the whole ten minutes. Serve this soup with sippets of toast. 

Sippets are bits of dry toast cut into a triangular form. 

A seasonable dish about the holidays. 

OX-TAIL SOUP. 

Two ox-tails, two slices of ham, one ounce of butter, two carrots, two turnips, 
three onions, one leek, one head of celery, one bunch of savory herbs, pepper, a 
tablespoonful of salt, two tablespoonfuls of catsup, one-half glass of port wine, 
three quarts of water. 

Cut up the tails, separating them at the joints; wash them, and put 
them in a stewpan with the butter. Out the vegetables in sUces and add them with 
the herbs. Put in one-half pint of water, and stir it over a quick fire till the 
juices are drawn. Fill up the stewpan with water, and when boiling, add the salt. 
Skim weU, and simmer very gently for f oiu- hours, or until the tails are tender. 
Take them out, skim and strain the soup, thicken with flour, and flavor with the 
catsup and port wine. Put back the tails, simmer for five minutes and serve. 

Another way to make an appetizing ox-tail soup. You should begin to make it 
the day before you wish to eat the soup. Take two tails, wash clean, and put 
in a kettle with nearly a gallon of cold water; add a small handful. of salt; 
when the meat is well cooked, take out the bones. Let this stand in a cool 
room, covered, and next day, about an hour and a half before dinner, skim off 
the crust or cake of fat which has risen to the top. Add a Uttle onion, carrot, 
or any vegetables you choose, chopping them fine first; summer savory may 
also be added. 

CORN SOUP. 

Cut the corn from the cob, and boil the cobs in water for at least an hour, 
then add the grains, and boil until they are thoroughly done; put one dozen 
ears of corn to a gallon of water, which will be reduced to three quarts by the 
time the soup is done; then pour on a pint of new milk, two weU-beaten eggs, 
salt and pepper to your taste; continue the bofling a while longer, and stir in, to 
season and thicken it a little,- a tablespoonful of good butter rubbed up with two 
tablespoonfuls of flour. Com soup may also be made nicely with water in 
which a pair of grown fowls have been boiled or parboiled, instead of having 
plain water for the foundation. 



SOUPS. 29 

SPLIT PEA SOUP. No. I. 

Wash well a pint of split peas and cover them well with cold water, adding 
a third of a teaspoonful of soda; let them remain in it over night to swell. In 
the morning put them in a kettle with a close fitting cover. Pour over them 
three quarts of cold water, adding half a pomid of lean ham or bacon cut into 
slices or pieces; also a teaspoonful of salt and a little pepper, and some celery 
chopped fine. When the soup begins to boil, skim the froth from the surface. 
Cook slowly from three to foiu- hours, stirring occasionally till the peas are all 
dissolved, adding a little more boiling water to keep up the quantity as it boils 
away. Strain through a colander, and leave out the meat. It should be quite 
thick. Serve with small squares of toasted bread, cut up and added. If not 
rich enough, add a small piece of butter. 

CREAM OF ASPARAGUS. 

For making two quarts of soup, use two bundles of fresh asparagus. Cut the 
tops from one of the bunches and cook them twenty minutes in salted water, enough 
to cover them. Cook the remainder of the asparagus about twenty minutes in a quart 
of stock or water. Cut an onion into thin slices and fry in three tablespoonfuls of 
butter ten minutes, being careful not to scorch it; then add the asparagus that has 
been boiled in the stock ; cook this five minutes, stirring constantly ; then add three 
tablespoonfuls of dissolved flour, cook five minutes longer. Turn this mixture into 
the boiling stock and boil twenty minutes. Hub through a sieve ; add the milk and 
cream and the asparagus heads. If water is used in place of stock, use all cream. 

GREEN PEA SOUP. 

Wash a small quarter of lamb in cold water, and put it into a soup-pot with 
six quarts of cold water; add to it two tablespoonfuls of salt, and set it over a 
moderate fire — let it boil gently for two hom-s, then skim it clear: add a quart 
of shelled peas, and a teaspoonful of pepper; cover it, and let it boil for half an 
hour; then having scraped the skins from a quart of small young potatoes, add 
•them to the soup; cover the pot and let it boil for half an hour longer; work 
quarter of a pound of butter and a dessert spoonful of flour together, and add 
them to the soup ten or twelve minutes before taking it off the fire. 

Serve the meat on a dish with parsley sauce over, and the soup in a tinreen. 

DRIED BEAN SOUP. 

Put two quarts of dried white beans to soak the night before you make the 
soup, which should be put on as early in the day as possible. 



30 SOUPS. 

Take two pounds of the lean of fresh beef — ^the coarse pieces will do, Cul 
them up, and put them into your soup-pot with the bones belonging to them, 
(which should be broken in pieces,) and a pound of lean bacon, cut very small. 
K you have the remains of a piece of beef that has been roasted the day before, 
and so much under-done that the juices remain in it, you may put it into the 
pot and its bones along with it. Season the meat with pepper only, and pour 
on it six quarts of water. As soon as it boils, take off the scum, and put iu the 
beans (having first drained them) and a head of celery cut small, or a table- 
spoonful of pounded celery seed. Boil it slowly tiU the meat is done to shreds, 
and the beans all dissolved. Then strain it through a colander into the tureen, 
and put into it small squares of toasted bread with the crust cut off. 

TURTLE SOUP FROM BEANS. 

Soak over night one quart of black beans; next day boil them in the proper 
quantity of water, say a gallon, then dip the beans out of the pot and strain 
them through a colander. Then return the flour of the beans, thus pressed, into 
the pot in which they were boUed. Tie up in a thin cloth some thyme, a tea- 
spoonful of summer savory and parsley, and let it boil in the mixture. Add a 
tablespoonf ul of cold butter, salt and pepper. Have ready four hard-boiled yolks 
of eggs quartered, and a few force meat balls; add this to the soup with a sUced 
lemon, and half a glass of wine just before serving the soup. 

This approaches so near in flavor to the real turtle soup that few are able to 
distinguish the difference. 

PHILADELPHIA PEPPER POT. 

Put two pounds of tripe and four calves' feet into the soup-pot and cover 
them with cold water; add a red pepper, and boil closely until the calves' feet 
are boiled very tender; take out the meat, skim the hquid, stir it, cut the tripe 
into small pieces, and put it back into the Kquid; if there is not enough liquid, 
add boiling water; add half a teaspoonful of sweet marjoram, sweet basil, and 
thyme, two sliced onions, sUced potatoes, salt. When the vegetables have 
boiled until almost tender, add a piece of butter rolled in flour, drop in some egg 
balls, and boil fifteen minutes more. Take up and serve hot. 

SQUIRREL SOUP. 

Wash and quarter three or four good sized squirrels; put them on, with a 
small tablespoonful of salt, directly after breakfast, in a gallon of cold water. 



SOUPS. 31 

Cover the pot close, and set it on the back part of the stove to simmer gently, 
not boU. Add vegetables just the same as you do in case of other meat soups 
in the summer season, but especially good will you find com, Irish potatoes, 
tomatoes and Lima beans. Strain the soup through a coarse colander when the 
meat has boiled to shreds, so as to get rid of the squirrel's troublesome Uttle 
bones. Then return to the pot, and after boiling a while longer, thicken with a 
piece of butter rubbed in flour. Celery and parsley leaves chopped up are also 
considered an improvement by many. Toast two shoes of bread, cut them into 
dice one half inch square, fry them in butter, put them into the bottom of 
your tureen, and then pour the soup boiling hot upon them. Very good. 

TOMATO SOUP. No. I. 

Place in a kettle four pounds of beef. Pour over it one gallon of cold water. 
Let the meat and water boil slowly for three hours, or untU the hquid is reduced 
to about one-half. Eemove the meat and put into the broth a quart of tomatoes, 
and one chopped onion; salt and pepper to taste. A teaspoonful of flour shoiild 
be dissolved and stirred in, then allowed to boil half an hour longer. Strain 
and serve hot. Canned tomatoes, in place of fresh ones, may be used. 

TOMATO SOUP. No. 2. 

Place over the fire a quart of peeled tomatoes, stew them soft with a pinch 
of soda. Strain it so that no seeds remain, set it over the fire again, and add a 
quart of hot boiled milk ; season with salt and pepper, a piece of butter the size 
of an egg, add three tablespoonfuls of roUed cracker, and serve hot. Canned 
tomatoes may be used in place of fresh ones. 

TOMATO SOUP. No. 3» 

Peel two quarts of tomatoes, boil them in a sauce-pan with an onion, and 
other soup vegetables; strain and add a level tablespoonful of flour dissolved in 
a third of a cup of melted butter; add pepper and salt. Serve very hot over 
Uttle squares of bread fried brown and crisp in butter. 

An excellent addition to a cold meat lunch.

fire, till it boils, then place it on a comer of the fire, and let it simmer twenty min- 
utes; add one tablespoonful of currie powder, and one tablespoonful of flour; mix 
the whole weU together, and let it boil three minutes; pass it through a colander; 
serve with pieces of roast chicken in it; add boiled rice in a separate dish. It 
must be of good yellow color, and not too thick. If you find it too thick, add a 
little boiling water and a teaspoonful of sugar. Half veal and half chicken an- 
swers as weU. 

A dish of rice, to be served separately with this soup, must be thus prepared: 
put three pints of water in r^, sauce-pan and one tablespoonful of salt; let this 
boil. Wash well, in three waters, half a poimd of rice; strain it, and put it into 
the boiling water in sauce-pan. After it has come to the boil — which it wiU do 
in about two minutes— let it boil twenty minutes; strain it through a colander, 
and povu" over it two quarts of cold water. This will separate the grains of rice. 
Put it back in the sauce-pan, and place it near the fire untU hot enough to send 
to the table. This is also the proper way to boil rice for curries. If these direc- 
tions are strictly carried out every grain of the rice wiU separate, and be thor- 
oughly cooked. 

MOCK TURTLE SOUP, OF CALF'S HEAD. 

Scald a weU-cleansed calf's head, remove the brain, tie it up in a cloth, and 
boil an hour, or until the meat wiU easily slip from the bone; take out, save the 
broth; cut it in small, square pieces, and throw them into cold water; when 
cool, put it in a stewpan, and cover with sK me of the broth; let it boil until 
quite tender, and set aside. 

In another stewpan melt some butter, and in it put a quarter of a pound of 
fean ham, cut small, with fine herbs to taste; also parsley and one onion; add 
about a pint of the broth; let it simmer for two hours, and then dredge in a 
small quantity of flour; now add the remainder of the broth, and a quarter bot- 
tle of Madeira or sherry; let aU stew quietly for ten minutes and rub it through 
a medium sieve; add the calf's head, season with a very- little cayenne pepper, a 
little salt, the juice of one lemon, and if desired, a quarter teaspoonful pounded 
mace and a dessert-spoon sugar. 

Having previously prepared force-meat balls, add them to the soup, and five 
minutes after serve hot. 

GREEN TURTLE SOUP. 

One turtle, two onions, a bunch of sweet herbs, jmce of one lemon, five quarts 
of water, i glass of Madeira. 



SOUPS, 33 

After removing the entrails, cut up tlie coarser parts of the turtle meat and 
bones. Add four quarts of water, and stew four hours with the herbs, onions, 
pepper and salt. Stew very slowly, do not let it cease boiling during this time. 
At the end of four hours strain the soup, and add the finer parts of the turtle 
and the green fat, which has been simmered one hour in two quarts of water. 
Thicken with brown flour; return to the soup-pot, and simmer gently for an 
hour longer. If there are eggs in the turtle, boil them in a separate vessel for 
four hours, and throw into the soup before taking up. If not, put in force-meat 
balls; then the juice of the lemon, and the wine; beat up at once and pour out. 

Some cooks add the finer meat before straining, bofling all together five 
hours; then strain, thicken, and put in the green fat, cut into lumps an xada. 
long. This makes a handsomer soup than if the meat is left in. 

Green turtle can now be purchased preserved ia air-tight cans. 

Force Meat Balls for the Above. — Six tablespoonfuls of turtle-meat chopped 
very fine. Eub to a paste, with the yolk of two hard-boiled eggs, a tablespoon- 
f ul of butter, and, if convenient a little oyster hquor. Season with cayenne, 
mace, and half a teaspoonful of white sugar and a pinch of salt. Bind all with 
a, weU-beaten egg; shape into small baUs; dip in egg, then powdered cracker; 
fry in butter, and drop into the soup when it is served. 

MACARONI SOUP. 

To a rich beef or other soup, in which there is no seasomng other than pep- 
per or salt, take half a potmd of small pipe macaroni, boil it in clear water until 
it is tender, then drain it and cut it in pieces of an inch length; boil it for fifteen 
minutes in the soup and serve. 

TURKEY SOUP. 

Take the turkey bones and boil three-quarters of an hour in water enough to 
cover them; add a Uttle summer savory and celery chopped fine. Just before 
serving, thicken with a httle flour (browned), and season with pepper, salt, 
and a small piece of butter. This is a cheap but good soup, using the remains of 
cold turkey which might otherwise be thrown away. 

GUMBO OR OKRA SOUP. 

Fry out the fat of a slice of bacon or fat ham, drain it off, and in it fry the 
shces of a large onion brown; scald, peel, and cut up two quarts fresh tomato^,

In chicken broth the same quantity of okra pods, used for thickening instead 
of tomatoes, forms a chicken gumbo soup. 

TAPIOCA CREAM SOUP. 

One quart of white stock; one pint of cream or milk; one onion; two stalks 
celery; one-third of a cupful of tapioca; two cupfuls of cold water; one table- 
spoonful of butter; a small piece of mace; salt, pepper. Wash the tapioca and

sticking. Let it remain on the bread board to dry for an hour or more; then 
roU it up into a tight scroll, like a sheet of music. Begin at the end and slice it 
into shps as thin as straws. After all are cut, mix them lightly together, and 
to prevent them sticking, keep them floured a Uttle until you are ready to drop 
them into your soup, which should be done shortly before dinner, for if boiled 
too long they will go to pieces. 

FORCE MEAT BALLS FOR SOUP. X 

One cupful of cooked veal or fowl meat, minced; mix with this a handful of 
fine bread-crumbs, the yolks of four hard-boiled eggs rubbed smooth together

SUET DUMPLINGS FOR SOUP. ^ 



Three cups of sifted flour in which three teaspoonfuls of baking powder have 
been sifted; one cup of finely chopped suet, well rubbed into the floiu-, with a 
teaspoonful of salt. Wet all with sweet milk to make a dough as stiff as bis- 
cuit. Make into small balls as large as peaches, well floured. Drop into the 
soup three-quarters of an hour before being served. This requires steady boil- 
ing, being closely covered, and the cover not to be removed until taken up to serve. 
A very good form of pot-pie. 

SOYER'S RECIPE FOR FORCE MEATS. 

Take li lbs. of lean veal from the fillet, and cut it in long thin sUces; scrape 
with a knife tiU nothing but the fibre remains; put it in a mortar, pound it 10 
minutes, or until in a puree; pass it through a wire sieve (use the remainder in 
stock); then take 1 lb. of good fresh beef suet, which skin, shred, and chop 
very fine; put it in a mortar and pound it; then add 6 oz. of panada (that is, 
bread soaked in milk, and boiled tiU nearly dry) with the suet; pound them well 
together, and add the veal; season with 1 teaspoonful of salt, i teaspoonful of 
pepper, i that of nutmeg; work all well together; then add i eggs by degrees, 
continually pounding the contents of the mortar. When well mixed, take a 
small piece in a spoon, and poach it in some boiling water; and if it is deUcate, 
firm, and of a good flavor, it is ready for use. 

CROUTONS FOR SOUP. 

In a frying pan have the depth of an inch of boiling fat; also have prepared 
slices of stale bread cut up into httle half -inch squares; drop into the frying 
pan enough of these bits of bread to cover the surface of the fat. When 
browned, remove mth a skimmer and drain; add to the hot soup and serve. 

Some prefer them prepared in this manner: 

Take very thin shoes of bread, butter them well; cut them up into little 
squares three fotirths of an inch thick, place them in a baking pan, buttered 
ide up, and brown in a quick oven. 



38 SOUPS WITHOUT MEAT. 

FISH STOCK. 

Place a saucepan over the fire with a good sized piece of sweet butter, and a 
sliced onion; put into that some sliced tomatoes, then add as many different 
kinds of small fish as you can get — oysters, clams, smelts, pawns, crabs, shrimps, 
and all kinds of pan-fish; cook all together, until the onions are weU browned: 
then add a bunch of sweet herbs, salt and pepper, and sufficient water to make 
the required amount of stock. After this has cooked for half an hour pound it 
with a wooden pestle, then strain and cook again until it jellies. 

FISH SOUP. 

Select a large, fine fish, clean it thoroughly, put it over the fire with a suffi- 
cient quantity of water, allowing for each pound of fish one quart of water; 
add an onion cut fine, and a bunch of sweet herbs. When the fish is cooked, 
and is quite tasteless, strain aU through a colander, return to the fire, add some 
butter, salt and pepper to taste. A small tablespoonful of Worcestershire sauce 
may be added if liked. Served with small squares of fried bread and thin 
slices of lemon. 

LOBSTER SOUP, OR BISQUE. 

Have ready a good broth made of three pounds of veal boiled slowly in as 
much water as Avill cover it, tiU the meat is reduced to shreds. It must then be 
weU strained. 

Having boiled one fine middle-sized lobster, extract aJl the meat from the 
body and claws. Bruise part of the coral in a mortar, and also an equal quan- 
tity of the meat. Mix them well together. Add mace, cayenne, salt and 
pepper, and make them up into force-meat balls, binding the mixture with the 
yolk of an egg slightly beaten. 

Take three quarts of the veal broth, and put into it the meat of the lobster 
cut into mouthfuls. Boil it together about twenty minutes. Then thicken it 
with the remaining coral (which you must first rub through a sieve), and add 
the force-meat balls and a httle butter roUed in flour. Simmer it gently for ten 
minutes but do not let it come to a boU, as that wiU injure the color. Serve with 
small dice of bread fried brown in butter. 

OYSTER SOUP. No. i. 

Two quarts of oysters, one quart of milk, two tablespoonfuls of butter, one 
teacupful of hot water; pepper, salt. 



SOUPS WITHOUT MEAT. 39 

Strain all the liquor from the oysters; add the water, and heat. When near 
the boil, add the seasoning, then the oysters. Cook about five minutes from 
the time they begin to simmer, until they " ruffle. " Stir in the butter, cook one 
minute, and pour into the tureen. Stir in the boiling milk, and send to table. 
Some prefer all water in place of milk. 

OYSTER SOUP. No. 2. 

Scald one gallon of oysters in their own hquor. Add one quart of rich milk 
to the hquor, and when it comes to a boU, skim out the oysters and set aside. 
Add the yolks of four eggs, two good tablespoonfuls of butter, and one of flour, 
all mixed well together, but in this order— first, the milk, then, after beating 
the eggs, add a httle of the hot hquor to them gradually, and stir them rapidly 
into the soup. Lastly, add the butter and whatever seasoning you fancy besides 
plain pepper and salt, which must both be put in to taste with caution. Celery salt 
most persons hke extremely; others would prefer a little marjoram and thyme; 
others, again, mace and a bit of onion. Use your own discretion in this regard. 

CLAM SOUP. (French Style.) 

Mince two dozen hard-sneU clams very fine. Fry half a minced onion in an 
ounce of butter; add to it a pint of hot water, a pinch of mace, four cloves, one 
allspice and six whole pepper corns. Boil fifteen minutes and strain into a 
sauce-pan; add the chopped clams and a pint of clam-juice or hot water; simmer 
slowly two hours; strain and rub the pulp through a sieve into the hquid. 
Eetum it to the sauce-pan and keep it lukewarm. BoU three half- pints of milk 
in a sauce-pan (previously wet with cold water, which prevents burning) and 
whisk it into the soup. Dissolve a teaspoonful of fiour in cold milk, add it to the 
soup, taste for seasoning; heat it gently to near the boiling point; pour it into a 
tureen previously heated with hot water, and serve with or without pieces of 
fried bread — called croutons in kitchen French. 

CLAM SOUP. 

Twenty -five clams chopped fine. Put over the fire the hquor that was 
drained from them, and a cup of water; add the chopped clams, and boil haU 
an hour; then season to taste with pepper and salt and a piece of butter as large 
as an eggj boil up again and add one quart of milk boihng hot, stir in a table- 
spoon of flotu' made to a cream with a little cold milk, or two crackers rolled 
fine. Some hke a httle mace and lemon juice in the seasoning.

The usual custom among professional cooks is to entirely immerse the articl*. 
to be cooked in boihng fat, but from inconvenience most households use the 
half -frying method of frying in a small amoimt of fat in a frying-pan. For the 
first method a shallow iron f rying-kettle, large at the top and small at the bottom, 
is best to use. The fat should half fill the kettle, or an amount sufiicient to float 
whatever is to be fried; the heat of the fat should get to such a degree that, 
when a piece of bread or a teaspoonful of the batter is dropped in it, it will 
become brown almost instantly, but should not be so hot as to burn the fat. 
Some cooks say that the fat should be smoking, but my experience is, that is a 
mistake, as that soon ruins the fat. As soon as it begins to smoke it should be 
removed a httle to one side, and stiU be kept at the boiling point. If fritters, 
crullers, croquettes, etc., are dropped into fat that is too hot, it crusts over the 
outside before the inside has fuUy risen, making a heavy hard article, and also 
ruining the fat, giving it a biwnt flavor. 

Many French cooks prefer beef fat or suet to lard for frying purposes, con- 
sidering it more wholesome and digestible, does not impart as much flavor, or 
adhere or soak into the article cooked as pork fat. 

In families of any size, where there is much cooking required, there are 
enough drippings and fat remnants from roasts of beef, skimmings from the 
soup-kettle, with the addition of occasionally a pound of suet from the market, 
to amply supply the need. AH such remnants and skimmings shovild be clarified 
about twice a week, by boiling them aU together in water. When the fat is all 
melted, it shoifld be strained with the water and set aside to cool. After the fat 
on the top has hardened, lift the cake from the water on which it Kes, scrape off 
all the dark particles from the bottom, then melt over again the fat; while hot 
strain into a small clean stone jar or bright tin paU, and then it is ready for use. 
Always after frying anything, the fat should stand untfl it settles and has cooled 
somewhat; then turn off carefully so as to leave it clear from the sediment that 
settles at the bottom. 



FISH. 41 

Refined cotton-seed oil is now being adopted by most professional cooks in 
hotels, restaurants, and many private households for culinary purposes, and will 
doubtless in future supersede animal fats, especially for frying, it being quite as 
delicate a medium as frying with oUve oil. It is now sold by leading grocers, 
put up in packages of two and four quarts. 

The second mode of frying, using a frying-pan with a small quantity of fat 
or grease, to be done properly, should in the first place have the frying-pan hot 
over the fire, and the fat in it actually boiling before the article to be cooked is 
placed in it, the intense heat quickly searing up the pores of the article and 
forming a brown crust on the lower side, then turning over and browning the 
other the same way. 

Still, there is another mode of frying; the process is somewhat similar to 
broiling, the hot frying-pan or spider replacing the hot fire. To do this cor- 
rectly, a thick bottom frying-pan should be used. Place it over the fire, and 
when it is so hot that it wiU siss, oil over the bottom of the pan with a piece of 
suet, that is if the meat is aU lean; if not, it is not necessary to grease the 
bottom of the pan. Lay in the meat quite fiat, and brown it quickly, first on one 
side then on the other; when sufficiently cooked, dish on a hot platter and season 
the same as broiled meats. 



jfisb 



In selecting fish, choose those only in which the eye is fuU and prominent, 
the flesh thick and firm, the scales bright and fins stiff. They should be thor- 
oughly cleaned before cooking. 

The usual modes of cooking fish are boiled, baked, broiled, fried and occa- 
sionally stewed. Steaming fish is much superior to boOing, but the ordinary 
conveniences in private houses do not admit of the possibihty of enjoying this 
dehcate way of cooking it. Large fish are generally boiled, medium-sized ones 
baked or boiled, the smaller kinds fried or brofied. Very large fish, such as cod, 
haKbut, etc., are cut in steaks or slices for frying or brofiing. The heads of some 
fish, as the cod, halibut, etc., are considered tidbits by many. Small fish, or 
pan fish, as they are usually called, are served without the heads, with the 
exception of brook-trouts and smelts; these are usually cooked whole, with the 
head on. Bake fish slowly, basting often with butter and water. Salmon is 
considered the most nutritious of aU fish. When boiling fish, by adding a httle 
vinegar and salt to the water, it seasons and prevents the nutriment from being 
drawn out; the vinegar acting on the water hardens the water. 



42 FISH. 

Fill the fish with a nicely prepared stuffing of rolled cracker or stale bread 
crumbs, seasoned with butter, pepper, salt, sage, and any other aromatic herbs, 
fancied; sew up; wrap in a well-floured cloth, tied closely with twine, and boil 
or steam. The garnishes for boiled fish are: For tiirbot, fried smelts; for other 
boiled fish, parsley, shced beets, lemon or sliced boiled egg. Do not use the 
knives, spoons, etc., that are used in cooking fish, for other food, or they will 
be apt to iwipart a fishy fiavor. 

Fish tc be boiled should be put iuto cold water and set on the fire to cook 
very gently, or the outside wiU break before the iuner part is done. Unless 
the fish are small, they should never be put into warm water; nor should water, 
either hot or cold, be povired on to the fish, as it is hable to break the skin: if it 
should be necessary to add a Httle water while the fish is cooMng, it ought to b> 
poured in gently at the side of the vessel. 

Fish to be broiled should lie, after they are dressed, for two or three hours, 
with their inside well sprinkled with salt and pepper. 

Salt fish should be soaked in water before boihng, according to the time it 
has been in salt. When it is hard and dry, it wiU require thirty-six hours soak- 
ing before it is dressed, and the water must be changed three or four times. 
When fish is not very salt, twenty-four hours, or even one night, will suffice. 

When frying fish the fire must be hot enough to bring the fat to such a 
degree of heat as to sear the surface and make it impervious tt the fat, and at 
the same time seal up the rich juices. As soon as the fish is browned by this 
sudden apphcation of heat, the pan may be moved to a cooler place on the stove, 
that the process may be finished more slowly. 

Fat in which fish has been fried is just as good to use agaiu for the same 
purpose, but it should be kept by itself and not be put to any other use. 

TO FRY FISH. 

Most of the smaller fish (generally termed pan-fish) are usually fried. Clean 
well, cut off the head, and, if quite large, cut out the backbone, and shce the 
body crosswise into five or six pieces; season with salt and pepper. Dip in 
Indian meal or wheat flour, or iu beaten egg, and roll in bread or fine cracker 
crumbs — trout and perch should not be dipped in meal; put into a thick bot- 
tomed iron frying-pan, the flesh side down, with hot lard or drippings; fry 
slowly, turning when Ughtly browned. The following method may be deemed 
preferable: Dredge the pieces with flour; brush them over with beaten egg; roll 
in bread crumbs, and fry in hot lard or drippings sufficient to cover, the same

as frying crullers If the fat is very hot, the fish wiU fry without absorbing it, 
and it will be palatably cooked. When browned on one side, turn it over in the 
fat and brown the other, draining when done. This is a particularly good way 
to fry slices of large fish. Serve with tomato sauce; garnish with shoes of lemon. 

PAN FISH. 

Place them in a thick bottom frying-pan with heads all one way. Fill the 
spaces with smaller fish. When they are fried quite brown and ready to turn, 
put a dinner plate over them, drain off the fat; then invert the pan, and they 
will be left unbroken on the plate. Put the lard back into the pan, and when 
hot shp back the fish. When the other side is brown, drain, turn on a plate as 
before, and shp them on a warm platter, to be sent to the table. Leaving the 
heads on and the fish a crispy -brown, in perfect shape, improves the appearance 
if not the flavor. Garnish with slices of lemon.

BAKED PICKEREL. 

Carefully clean and wipe the fish, and lay in a dripping-pan with enough hot 
water to prevent scorching. A perforated sheet of tin, fitting loosely, or several 
muffin rings may be used to keep it off the bottom. Lay it in a circle on its 
belly, head and tail touching, and tied, or as directed in note on fish; bake 
slowly, basting often with butter and water. When done, have ready a cup of 
sweet cream or rich milk to which a few spoons of hot water has been added; 
stir in two large spoons of melted butter and a httle chopped parsley; heat all 
by setting the cup in boiling water; add the gravy from the dripping-pan, and 
let it boil up once; place the fish in a hot dish, and pour over it the sauce. Or 
an egg sauce may be made with drawn butter; stir in the yolk of an egg quickly, 
and then a teaspoon of chopped parsley. It can be stuffed or not, just as you 
please. 

BOILED SALMON. 

The middle shoe of salmon is the best. Sew up neatly in a mosquito-net 
bag, and boil a quarter of an hour to the pound in hot salted water. When done, 
unwrap with care, and lay upon a hot dish, taking care not to break it. Have 
ready a large cupful of drawn butter, very rich, in which has been stirred a 
tablespoonful of minced parsley and the juice of a lemon. Pour half upon the 
salmon, and serve the rest in a boat. Garnish with parsley and shced eggs.

BROILED SALMON. 

Cut slices from an inch to an inch and a half thick, dry them in a cloth, season 
with salt and pepper, dredge them in sifted flour, and broil on a gridiron rubbed 
with suet. 

Avotlner mode. — Cut the slices one inch thick, and season them with pepper 
and salt; butter a sheet of white paper, lay each shce on a separate piece, envelope 
them in it with their ends twisted; broU gently over a clear fire, and serve with 
anchovy or caper sauce. When higher seasoning is required, add a few chopped 
herbs and a little spice. 

FRESH SALMON FRIED. 

Cut the slices three-quarters of an inch thick, dredge them with flour, or dip 
them in egg and crumbs, — fry a light brown. This mode answers for aU fish 
cut into steaks. Season weU with salt and pepper. 

SALMON AND CAPER SAUCE. 

Two slices of salmon, one-quarter pound batter, one-half teaspoonful of 
chopped parsley, one shalot; salt and pepper to taste. 

Lay the salmon in a baking-dish, place pieces of butter over it and 
add the other ingredients, rubbing a little of the seasoning into the fish; place it 
in the oven and baste it frequently; when done, take it out and drain for a 
minute or two; lay it in a dish, pour caper sauce over it, and serve. Salmon 
dressed in this way, with tomato sauce, is very deUcious. 

BROILED SALT SALMON OR OTHER SALT FISH. 

Soak salmon in tepid or cold water twenty-four hours, changing water sev- 
eral times, or let stand under faucet of running water. If in a hurry or desiring 
a very salt relish, it may do to soak a short time, having water warm, and 
changing, parboiling slightly. At the hour wanted, broU sharply. Season to 
suit taste, covering with butter. This recipe will answer for all kinds of salt fish. 

PICKLED SALMON, 

Take a fine, fresh salmon, and having cleaned it, cut it into large pieces, and 
bc^ it in ealted water as if for eating. Then drain it, wrap it in a dry cloth, and 
set it in a cold place till next day. Then make the pickle, which must be in 



FJSH. 45 

proportion to the quantity of fish. To one quart of the water in which the 
salmon was boiled, allow two quarts of the best vinegar, one ounce of whole 
black pepper, one nutmeg grated and a dozen blades of mace. BoU all these 
together in a kettle closely covered to prevent the flavor from evaporating. 
When the vinegar thus prepared is quite cold, pour it over the salmon, and put 
on the top a tablespoonf ul of sweet oil, which will make it keep the longer. 

Cover it closely, put it in a dry, cool place, and it will be good for many 
months. This is the nicest way of preserving salmon, and is approved by all 
who have tried it. 

SMOKED SALMON. 

Smoked salmon to be broiled should be put upon the gridiron first, with the 
flesh side to the fire. 

Smoked salmon is very nice when shaved like smoked beef, and served with 
coffee or tea. 

FRICASSEE SALMON. 

This way of cooking fresh salmon is a pleasant change from the ordinary 
modes of cooking it: Cut one and one-half pounds of salmon into pieces one 
inch square; put the pieces in a stewpan with half a cupful of water, a little 
salt, a Uttle white pepper, one clove, one blade of mace, three pieces of sugar, 
one shalot and a heaping teaspoonful of mustard mixed smoothly with half a 
teacupful of vinegar. Let this boil up once and add six tomatoes peeled and 
cut into tiny pieces, a few sprigs of parsley finely minced, and one wineglassful 
of sherry. Let all simmer gently for three-quarters of an hour. Serve very 
hot, and garnish with dry toast cut in triangular pieces. This dish is good, very 
cold, for Ivmcheon or breakfast. 

SALMON PATTIES. 

Cut cold cooked salmon into dice. Heat about a pint of the dice in half a 
pint of cream. Season to taste with cayenne pepper and salt. Fill the shells 
and serve. Cold cooked fish of any kind may be made into patties in this way. 
Use any fish sauce you choose — aU are equally good. 

FISH AND OYSTER PIE. 

Any remains of cold fish, such as cod or haddock, 2 dozen oystevs, pepper and 
salt to taste, bread-crumbs sufficient for the quantity of fish; \ teaspoonful (rf 
grated nutmeg, 1 teaspoonful of finely chopped parsley. 



46 FISH. 

Clear the fish from the bones, and put a layer of it in a pie-dish, which 
sprinkle with pepper and salt; then a layer of bread-crumbs, oysters, nutmeg, 
and chopped parsley, Eepeat this till the dish is quite fuU. You may form a 
covering either of bread crumbs, which should be browned, or puff -paste, which 
should be cut off into long strips, and laid in cross-bars over the fish, with a line 
of the paste first laid round the edge. Before putting on the top, pour in some 
made melted butter, or a httle thin white sauce, and the oyster-hquor, and bake. 

Time. — If of cooked fish, i hour; if made of fresh fish and puff -paste, | hour. 

STEAMED FISH. 

Secure the tail of the fish in its mouth, the body in a circle; pour over it 
half a pint of vinegar, seasoned with pepper and salt; let it stand an hour in a 
cool place; pour off the vinegar, and put it in a steamer over boiUng water, and 
steam twenty minutes, or longer for large fish. When the meat easily separates 
from the bone it is done. Drain weU, and serve on a very clean white napkin, 
neatly folded and placed on the platter; decorate the napkin around the fish with 
sprigs of curled parsley, or with fanciful beet cuttings, or alternately vrith 
both. 

TO BROIL A SHAD. 

Spht and wash the shad, and afterwards dry it in a cloth. Season it with 
salt and pepper. Have ready a bed of clear, bright coals. Grease your gridiron 
weU, and as soon as it is hot, lay the shad upon it, the flesh side down; cover 
with a dripping-pan and broil it for about a quarter of an hour, or more, accord- 
ing to the thickness. Butter it well, and send it to the table. Covering it while 
broiling gives it a more delicious flavor. 

BAKED SHAD. 

Many people are of the opinion that the very best method of cooking a shad 
is to bake it. Stuff it with bread-crumbs, salt, pepper, butter and parsley, and 
mix this up with the beaten yolk of egg; fill the fish with it, and sew it up or 
fasten a string aroimd it. Pour over it a little water and some butter, and bake 
as you would a fowl. A shad will require from an hour to an hour and a 
quarter to bake. Garnish with slices of lemon, water cresses, etc. 

Dressing for Baked Shad.— Boil up the gravy in which the shad was baked, 
put in a large tablespoonf ul of catsup, a tablespoonfiil of brown flour which 
has been wet with cold water, the juice of a lemon, and a glass of sherry or Ma- 
deira wine. Serve in a sauce boat. 



FISH. 47 

TO COOK A SHAD ROE. 

Drop into boiling water, and cook gently for twenty minutes; then take from 
She fire, and drain. Butter a tin plate, and lay the drained roe upon it. Dredge 
well with salt and pepper, and spread soft butter over it; then dredge thickly 
with flour. Cook • in the oven for half an hour, basting frequently with salt, 
pepper, flour, butter and water. 

TO COOK SHAD ROE. (Another Way.) 

ilrst partly boil them in a small covered pan, take out and season them with 
salt, a little pepper, dredge with flour and fry as any fish. 

BOILED BASS. 

After thoroughly cleaning it place in a saucepan with enough water to cover it; 
add two tablespoonfuis of salt; set the saucepan over the fire, and when it has boiled 
about five minutes try to pull out one of the fins ; if it loosens easily from the body 
carefully take the fish out of the water, lay it on a platter, surround it with half a 
dozen hard-boiled eggs, and serve it with a sauce. 

BOILED BLUEFISH. 
Boiled the same as Bass. 

BAKED BLUEFISH. 
Baked the same as Baked Shad — see page 46. 

FRIED EELS. 

After cleaning the eels well, cut them in pieces two inches long; wash them 
and wipe them dry; roU them in wheat flour or rolled cracker, and fry as di- 
rected for other fish, in hot lard or beef dripping, salted. They should b© 
browned aU over and thoroughly done. 

Eels are sometimes dipped ia batter and then fried, or into egg and bread 
crumbs. Serve with crisped parsley. 

SHEEPSHEAD WITH DRAWN BUTTER. 

Select a medium-sized fish, clean it thoroughly, and rub a httle salt over it| 
wrap it iu a cloth and put it in a steamer; place this over a pot of fast-bofling 
water and steam one hour; then lay it whole upon a hot side-dish, garnish with 



48 FISH^ 

tufts of parsley and slices of lemon, and serve with drawn butter, prepared as 
follows: Take two ounces of butter and roll it into small balls, dredge these 
with flour; put one-fourth of them in a sauce-pan, and as they begin to melt, 
whisk them; add the remainder, one at a time, imtil thoroughly smooth; while 
stirring, add a tablespoonful of lemon juice, half a tablespoonf ul of chopped pars- 
ley; pour into a hot sauce boat, and serve. 



BAKED WHITE FISH. 

Thoroughly clean the fish; cut off the head or not, as preferred; cut out the 
backbone from the head to within two inches of the tail, and stuff with the fol- 
lowing: Soak stale bread in water, squeeze dry; cut in pieces a large onion, fry 
in butter, chop fine; add the bread, two oimces of butter, salt, pepper and a ht- 
tle parsley or sage; heat through, and when taken off the fire, add the yolks of 
two weU-beaten eggs; stuff the fish rather fuU, sew up with fine twine, and 
wrap with several coils of white tape. Rub the fish over shghtly with butter; 
just cover the bottom of a baking pan with hot water, and place the fish in it, 
standing back upward, and bent in the form of an S. Serve with the following 
dressing: Eeduce the yolks of two hard-boUed eggs to a smooth paste with two 
tablespoonf uls good salad oU; stir in half a teaspoon English mustard, and add 
pepper and vinegar to taste, 

HALIBUT BOILED. 

The cut next to the tail-piece is the best to boU. Rub a little salt over it, 
soak it for fifteen minutes in vinegar and cold water, then wash it and scrape 
it until quite clean; tie it in a cloth, and boU slowly over a moderate fire, allow- 
ing seven minutes boiling to each pound of fish; when it is half cooked, turn it 
over in the pofc; serve with drawn butter or egg sauce. 

Boiled halibut minced with boiled potatoes, and a httle butter and mflk, makes 
an excellent breakfast dish. 

STEAMED HALIBUT. 

Select a three-pound piece of white halibut, cover it with a cloth and place it 
in a steamer; set the steamer over a pot of fast-boUing water and steam two 
hours: nlace it on a hot dish surrounded with a border of parsley, and serve with 
egg-sauce. 



FISH. 49 

FRIED HALIBUT. No. I. 

Select choice, flbrm slices from this large and delicate-looking fish, and, after 
carefully washing and drying with a soft towel, with a sharp knife take off the 
skin. Beat up two eggs, and roU out some brittle crackers upon the kneading 
board until they are as fine as dust. Dip each shoe into the beaten egg, then 
into the cracker crumbs, (after you have salted and peppered the fish), and place 
them in a hot frying-pan half full of boiling lard, in which a little butter has 
been added to make the fish brown nicely; turn and brown both sides, remove 
from the frying-pan and drain. Serve hot. 

FRIED HALIBUT. No. 2. 

First fry a few thin shoes of salt pork until brown in an iron frying-pan; 
then take it up on a hot platter, and keep it warm until the hahbut is fried. 
After washing and drying two pounds of shced hahbut, sprinkle it with salt and 
pepper, dredge it well with flour, put it into the hot pork-drippings and fry 
brown on both sides; then serve the pork with the fish. 

HaUbut broiled in shoes is a very good way of cooking it, broiled the same as 
Spanish mackerel. 

BAKED HALIBUT. 
Take a nice piece of hahbut weighing five or six pounds, and lay it in salt 
water for two hours. Wipe it dry and score the outer skin. Set it in a drip- 
ping-pan in a moderate hot oven, and bake an hour, basting often with butter 
and water heated together in a sauce-pan or tin cup. When a fork will pene- 
trate it easily, it is done. It shoxild be a fine, brown color. Take the gravy in 
the dripping-pan, add a httle boihng water should there not be enough, stir in 
a tablespoonful of walnut catsup, a teaspoonful of Worcestershire sauce, the 
juice of a lemon, and thicken with brown fiour, previously wet with cold water. 
Boil up once and put in a sauce boat. 

HALIBUT BROILED. 

Broil the same as other fish, upon a buttered gridiron, over a clear fire, first 
seasoning with salt and pepper, placed on a hot dish when done, buttered well 
and cover closely. 

FRIED BROOK TROUT. 

These dehcate fish are usually fried, and form a delightful breakfast or sup- 
per dish. Cleam^ wash and dry the fish, split them to the tail, salt and pepper

them, and flour them nicely. If you use lard instead of the fat of fried salt 
pork, put in a piece of butter to prevent their sticking, and which causes them 
to brown nicely. Let the fat be hot, fry quickly to a delicate brown. They 
should be sufficiently browned on one side before turning on the other side. 
They are nice served with shoes of fried pork, fried crisp. Lay them side by 
side on a heated platter, garnish and send hot to the table. They are often 
cooked and served with their heads on. 

FRIED SMELTS. 

Fried with their heads on the same as brook trout. Many think that they 
make a much better appearance as a dish when cooked whole with the heads 
on, and nicely garnished for the table, 

BOILED WHITE FISH. 

Taken from Mrs. A. W. Ferry's Cook Book, Mackinac, 1824. The most deU- 
cate mode of cooking white fish.. Prepare the fish as for broiling, laying it open; 
put it into a dripping-pan with the back down; nearly cover with water; to one 
fish two tablespoonfuls of salt; cover tightly and simmer (not boil) one-half 
hour. Dress with gravy, a Uttle butter and pepper, and garnish with hard- 
boiled eggs. 

BAKED WHITE FISH. (Bordeaux Sauce.) 

Clean and stuff the fish. Put it in a baking-pan and add a hberal quantity 
of butter, previously rolled in flour, to the fish. Put in the pan half a pint of 
claret, and bake for an hour and a quarter. Eemove the fish and strain the 
gravy; add to the latter a giU more of claret, a teaspoonful of brown flour 
and a pinch of cayenne, and serve with the fish.

BAKED SALMON TROUT. 

This dehciously flavored game-flsh is baked precisely as shad or white fish, 
out should be accompanied with cream gravy to make it perfect. It should be 
baked slowly, basting often with butter and water. When done, have ready in 
a sauce-pan a cup of cream, diluted with a few spoonfuls of hot water, for fear 
it might clot in heating, in which have been stirred cautiously two tablespoon- 
fuls of melted butter, a scant tablespoonf ul of floiir, and a Uttle chopped parsley. 
Heat this in a vessel set within another of boiUng water, add the gravy from the 



FISH. 51 

drippiiig-pan, boil up once to thicken, and when the trout is laid on a suitable 
hot dish, pour this sauce around it. Garnish with sprigs of parsley. 

This same fish boiled, served with the same cream gravy, (with the exception 
of the fish gravy,) is the proper way to cook it. 

TO BAKE SMELTS. 

Wash and dry them thoroughly in a cloth, and arrange them nicely in a flat 
baMng-dish; the pan should be buttered, also the fish; season with salt and pep- 
per, and cover with bread or cracker-crumbs. Place a piece of butter over each. 
Bake for fifteen or twenty minutes. Garnish with fried parsley and cut lemon. 

BROILED SPANISH MACKEREL. 

Spht the fish down the back, take out the back bone, wash it in cold water, 
dry it with a clean dry cloth, sprinkle it Ughtly with salt and lay it on a but- 
tered gridiron, over a clear fire, with the fiesh side downward, until it begins to 
brown; then turn the other side. Have ready a mixture of two tablespoonfuls 
of butter melted, a tablespoonful of lemon juice, a teaspoonful of salt, some pep- 
per. Dish up the fish hot from the gridiron on a hot dish, turn over the mix- 
ture and serve it while hot. 

Broiled Spanish mackerel is excellent with other fish sauces. Boiled Spanish 
mackerel is also very fine with most of the fish sauces, more especially " Matre 
d'Hotel Sauce." 

BOILED SALT MACKEREL. 

Wash and clean off all the brine and salt; put it to soak with the meat side 
down, in cold water over night; in the morning rinse it in one or two waters. 
Wrap each up in a cloth and put it into a kettle with considerable water, which 
should be cold; cook about thii"ty minutes. Take it carefully from the cloth, 
take out the back bones and pour over a Little melted butter and cream; add a 
Ught sprinkle of pepper. Or make a cream sauce hke the following: 

Heat a small cup of mUk to scalding. Stir into it a teaspoonful of com- starch 
wet up with a little water. When this thickens, add two tablespoonfuls of butter, 
pepper, salt, and chopped parsley, to taste. Beat an egg Hght, pour the sauce 
gradually over it, put the mixture again over the fire, and stir one minute, not 
more. Pour upon the fish, and serve it with some shces of lemon, or a few 
sprigs of parsley or water-cresses, on the dish as a garnish. 



5 5 FISH. 

BAKED SALT MACKEREL. 

When the mackerel have soaked over night, put them in a pan and pour on 
boihng water enough to cover. Let them stand a couple of minutes, then drain 
them off, and put them in the pan with a few lumps of butter; pour on a half 
teacupful of sweet cre^im, or rich milk, and a Uttle pepper; set in the oven and 
let it bake a httle until%)rown. 

FRIED SALT MACKEREL. 

Select as many salt mackerel as required; wash and cleanse them well, then 
put them to soak aU day in cold water, changing them every two hours; then 
put them into fresh water just before retiring. In the morning drain off the 
water, wipe them dry, roU them in flour, and fry in a little butter on a hot thick- 
bottom frying-pan. Serve with a httle melted butter poured over, and garnish 
with a Httle parsley. 

BOILED^FRESH MACKEREL. 

Fresh mackerel are cooked in water salted, and a little vinegar added; with 
this exception they can be served in the same way as the salt mackerel. 
Broiled ones are very nice with the same cream sauce, or you can substitute egg 
sauce. 

POTTED FRESH FISH. 

After the fish has laid in salt water six hours, take it out, and to every six 
pounds of fish take one-quarter cupful each of salt, black pepper and cinnamon, 
one eighth cupful of allspice, and one teaspoonful of cloves. 

Cut the fish in pieces and put into a half gallon stone baking-jar, first a layer 
of fish, then the spices, flour, and then spread a thin layer of butter on, and con- 
tinue so untU the dish is fuU. Fill the jar with equal parts of vinegar and water, 
cover with tightly fitting hd, so that the steam cannot escape; bake five hours, 
remove from the oven, and when it is cold, it is to be cut in shoes and served. 
This is a tea or lunch dish. 

SCALLOPED CRABS. 

Put the crabs into a kettle of boiling water, and throw in a handful of salt. 
Boil from twenty minutes to half an hour. Take them from the water when 
done and pick out aU the meat; be careful not to break the shell. To a pint of 
meat put a Uttle salt and pepper; taste, and if not enough add more, a little at a 



FJSH. 53 

time, till suited. Grate in a very little nutmeg, and add one spoonful of cracker or 
bread-crumbs, two eggs well beaten, and two tablespoonfuls of butter (even full): 
stir aU. weU together; wash the shells clean, and fill each shell fuU of the mix- 
ture; sprinkle crumbs over the top and moisten with the hquor; set in the oven 
tDl of a nice brown; a few minutes will do it. Send to the table hot, arranged 
on large dishes. They are eaten at breakfast or supper. 

FISH IN WHITE SAUCE. 

Flake up cold boiled hahbut and set the plate into the steamer, that the fish 
may heat without drying. Boil the bones and skin of the fish with a slice of 
onion and a very small piece of red pepper; a bit of this the size of a kernel of 
coffee will make the sauce quite as hot as most persons hke it. Boil this stock 
down to half a pint; thicken with one teaspoonful of butter and one teaspoonful 
of flour, mixed together. Add one drop of extract of almond. Pour this sauce 
over your hahbut and stick bits of parsley over it. 

FRESH STURGEON STEAK MARINADE. 

Take one shce of stm-geon two inches thick; let it stand in hot water five 
minutes; drain; put it in a bowl and add a gill of vinegar, two tablespoonfuls of 
melted butter, half a teaspoonful of salt, a saltspoonful of black pepper, and the 
juice of half a lemon; let it stand six hours, turning it occasionally; drain and 
dry on a napkin; dip it in egg; roll in bread-crumbs, and fry, or rather boil, in 
very hot fat. Beat up the yolks of two raw eggs, add a teaspoonful of French 
mustard, and, by degrees, half of the marinade, to make a smooth sauce, which 
serve with the fish. 

POTTED FISH. 

Take out the backbone of the fish; for one weighing two pounds take a table- 
spoonful of allspice and cloves mixed; these spices should be put into httle bags 
of not too thick muslin; put sufficient salt directly upon each fish; then roU in 
a cloth, over which sprinkle a httle cayenne pepper; put alternate layers of fish, 
spice and sage in an earthem jar; cover with the best cider vinegar; cover the 
jar closely with a plate, and over this put a covering of dough, rolled out to 
twice the thickness of pie crust. Make the edges of paste, to adhere closely to 
the sides of the jar, so as to make it air-tight. Put the jar into a pot of cold 
water and let it boil from three to nve hours, according to quantity. Ready 
when cold. 



54 FiSff. 

MAYONNAISE FISH. 

Take a pound or so of cold boiled fish (halibut, rock, or cod), not chop, but 
cut, into pieces an inch in length. Mix in a bowl a dressing as follows: The 
yolk of four boiled eggs rubbed to a smooth paste with salad oil or butter; add 
to these salt, pepper, mustard, two teaspoonfuls of white sugar, and, lastly, 
six tablespoonfuls of vinegar. Beat the mixture until hght, and just before 
pouring it over the fish, stir in Ughtly the frothed white of a raw egg. Serve 
the fish in a glass dish, with half the dressing stirred in with it. Spread the 
remainder over the top, and lay lettuce leaves (from the core of the head of let- 
tuce) around the edges, to be eaten with it. 

FISH CHOWDER. (Rhode Island.) 

Fry five or six slices of fat pork crisp in the bottom of the pot you are to 
make your chowder in; take them out and chop them into small pieces, put them 
back into the bottom of the pot with their own gravy. (This is much better 
than having the sHces whole.) 

Cut four poimds of fresh cod or sea-bass into pieces two inches square, and 
lay enough of these on the pork to cover it. Follow with a layer of chopped 
onions, a little parsley; summer savory and pepper, either black or cayenne. 
Then a layer of split Boston, or butter, or whole cream crackers, which have 
been soalced in warm water until moistened through, but not ready to break. 
Above this put a layer of pork, and repeat the order given above — onions, sea- 
soning, (not too much), crackers and pork, imtil jovoc materials are exhausted. 
Let the topmost layer be buttered crackers well soaked. Pour in enough cold 
water to barely cover all. Cover the pot, stew gently for an hour, watching 
that the water does not sink too low. Should it leave the upper layer exposed, 
replenish cautiously from the boiling tea-kettle. When the chowder is thoroughly 
done, take out with a perforated skimmer and put into a tureen. Thicken the 
gravy with a tablespoonful of flour and about the same quantity of butter; boil 
up and pom: over the chowder. Serve sKced lemon, pickles and stewed toma- 
toes with it, that the guests may add if they like. 

CODFISH BALLS. 

Take a pint bowl of codfish picked very fine, two pint bowls of whole raw 
peeled potatoes, sliced thickly; put them together in plenty of cold water and 
boil until the potatoes are thoroughly cooked; remove from the fire, and drain 
oflf aU the water. Mash them with the potato rpasher, add a piece of butter the 



FISH. 55 

size of an egg, one well -beaten egg, and three spoonfuls of cream or rich mUk. 
Flour your hands and make into balls or cakes. Put an ounce each of butter- 
and lard into a frying pan; when hot, put in the balls and fry a nice brown. Do 
not freshen the fish before boiling with the potatoes. Many cooks fry them in a 
quantity of lard similar to boiled doughnuts. 

STEWED CODFISH. (Salt.) 
Take a thick, white piece of salt codfish, lay it in cold water for a few min- 
utes to soften it a httle, enough to render it more easUy to be picked up. Shred 
it iQ very smaJl bits, put it over the fire in a stew-pan with cold water; let it 
come to a boU, turn off this water carefuUy, and add a pint of miU?: to the fish, 
or more according to quantity. Set it over the fire agaia and let it boU slowly 
about three minutes, now add a good-sized piece of butter, a shake of pepper 
and a thickening of a tablespoonf ul of flour in enough cold milk to make a cream. 
Stew five miuutes longer, and just before serving stir in two well-beaten eggs. 
The eggs are an addition that could be dispensed with, however, as it is very 
good without them. An excellent breakfast dish. 

CODFISH A LA MODE. 
Pick up a teacupful of salt codfish very fine, and freshen — the dessicated is 
nice to use; two cups mashed potatoes, one piut cream or milk, two weU-beaten 
eggs, half a cup butter, salt and pepper; mix; bake in an earthen baking dish 
from twenty to twenty-five minutes; serve in the same dish, placed on a small 
platter, covered with a fine napkin. 

BOILED FRESH COD. 

Sew up the piece of fish in thin cloth, fitted to shape; boil iu salted water 
(boiling from the first), allowing about fifteen minutes to the pound. CarefuUy 
imwrap, and pour over it warm oyster sauce. A whole one boiled the same. 

— Hotel Brighton. 
SCALLOPED FISH. 

Pick any cold fresh fish, or salt codfish, left from the dinner, into fine bits, 
carefully removing aU the bones. 

Take a pint of milk in a suitable dish, and place it in a sauce- pan of boiling 
water; put into it a few shces of onion, cut very fine, a sprig of parsley minced 
fine, add a piece of butter as large as an egg, a pinch of salt, a sprinkle of white 
pepper, then stir in two tablespoonfuls of corn-starch, or flour, rubbed in a little 
cold milk; let aU boil up and remove from the fire. Take a dish you wish to 



56 FISJI. 

serve it in, butter the sides and bottom. Put first a layer of the minced fish, 
then a layet* of the cream, then sprinkle over that some cracker or bread-crumbs, 
then a layer of fish again, and so on, untU the dish is full; spread cracker or 
bread-crumbs last on the top, to prevent the mUk from scorching. 

This is a very good way to use up cold fish, making a nice breakfast dish, or 
a side-dish for dumer. 

FISH FRITTERS. 

Take a piece of salt codfish, pick it up very fine, put it into a sauce-pan, with 
plenty of cold water; bring it to a boil, turn off the water, and add another of 
cold water; let this boil with the fish about fifteen minutes, very slowly; strain 
off this water, making the fish quite dry, and set aside to cool. In the meantime, 
stir up a batter of a pint of milk, four eggs, a pinch of salt, one large teaspoon- 
ful of baking powder in flour, enough to make thicker than batter cakes. Stir 
in the fish and fry like any fritters. Very fine accompaniment to a good break- 
fast, 

BOILED SALT CODFISH. (New England Style). 
Cut the fish into square pieces, cover with cold water, set on the back part of 
the stove; when hot, pour off water and cover again with cold water; let it 
stand about four hours and simmer, not boil; put the fish on a platter, then 
cover with a drawn-butter gravy, and serve. Many cooks prefer soaking the 
fish over night. 

BOILED CODFISH AND OYSTER SAUCE. 

Lay the fish in cold salted water half an hour before it is time to cook it, then 
roll it in a clean cloth dredged with flour; sew up the edges in such a manner 
as to envelope the fish entirely, yet have but one thickness of cloth over any 
part. Put the fish into boiling water, slightly salted; add a few whole cloves 
and peppers and a bit of lemon peel; puU gently on the fins, and when they come 
out easUy the fish is done. Arrange neatly on a folded napkin, garnish and 
serve with oyster sauce. Take six oysters to every pound of fish and scald 
(blanch) them in a half -pint of hot oyster hquor; take out the oysters and add to 
the liquor, salt, pepper, a bit of mace and an ounce of butter; whip into it a giU 
of milk containing half of a teaspoonful of flour. Simmer a moment; add 
the oysters, and send to table in a sauce-boat. Egg sauce is good with this fish. 

BAKED CODFISH. 
If salt fish, soak, boil and pick the fish, the same as for fish-baUs. Add an 
nqual quantity of mashed potatoes, or cold, boiled, chopped potatoes, a large 



SHELL-FISH. 57 

piece of butter, and warm milk enough to make it quite soft. Put it into a but- 
tered dish, rub butter over the top, shake over a little sifted flour, and bake about 
thirty minutes, and until a rich brown. Make a sauce of drawn butter, with 
two hard-boiled eggs sUced, served in a gravy-boat. 

CODFISH STEAK. (New England Style.) 

Select a medium-sized fresh codfish, cut it in steaks cross- wise of the fish, 
about an inch and a half thick; sprinkle a Kttle salt over them, and let them 
stand two hours. Cut into dice a poimd of salt fat pork, fry out all the fat 
from them and remove the crisp bits of pork; put the codfish steaks in a pan of 
corn meal, dredge them with it, and when the pork fat is smoking hot, fry the 
steaks in it to a dark-brown color on both sides. Squeeze over them a httle 
lemon jmce, add a dash of freshly ground pepper, and serve with hot, old-fash- 
ioned, weU-buttered Johnny Cake. 

SALMON CROQUETTES. 

One pound of cooked salmon (about one and a half pints when chopped), 
one cup of cream, two tablespoonfuls of butter, one tablespoonful of flour, three 
eggs, one pint of crumbs, pepper and salt; chop the salmon fine, mix the flour 
and butter together, let the cream come to a boil, and stir in the fiour and butter, 
salmon and seasoniag; boil one minute; stir in one well-beaten egg, and remove 
from the fire; when cold make into croquettes; dip in beaten egg, roU in crumbs 
and fry. Canned salmon can be used. 



STEWED WATER TURTLES, OR TERRAPINS. 

Select the largest, thickest and fattest, the females being the best; they ^ould 
be alive when brought from market. Wash and put them alive into boiling 
water, add a httle salt, and boil them until thoroughly done, or from ten to fif- 
teen minutes, after which take off the shell, extract the meat, and remove care- 
fully the sand-bag and gaU; also all the entrails; they are unfit to eat, and are 
no longer used in cooking terrapins for the best tables. Cut the meat into 
pieces, and put it into a stew-pan with its eggs, and sufficient fresh butter to 
stew it well. Let it stew till quite hot throughout, keeping the pan carefully 



58 SHELL-FISH. 

covered, that none of the flavor may escape, but shake it over the fire while 
stewing. In another pan make a sauce of beaten yolk of egg, highly flavored 
with Madeira or sherry, and powdered nutmeg and mace, a giU of currant jeUy, 
a pinch of cayenne pepper, and salt to taste, enriched with a large lump of fresh 
butter. Stir this sauce weU over the fire, and when it has almost come to a boil, 
take it off. Send the terrapins to the table hot in a covered dish, and the sauce 
separately in a sauce-tm'een, to be used by those who hke it, and omitted by 
those who prefer the genuine flavor of the terrapins when simply stewed with 
butter. This is now the usual mode of dressing terrapins in Maryland, Virginia, 
and many other parts of the South, and wiU be found superior to any other. If 
there are no eggs in the terrapin, "egg baUs" may be substituted. (See recipe). 

STEWED TERRAPIN, WITH CREAM. 

Place in a sauce-pan, two heaping tablespoonfuls of butter and one of dry 
flour; stir it over the fire until it bubbles; then gradually stir in a pint of cream, 
a teaspoonful of salt, a quarter of a teaspoon ful of white pepper, the same of 
grated nutmeg, and a very small pinch of cayenne. Next, put in a pint of ter- 
rapin meat and stir all until it is scalding hot. Move the sauce-pan to the back 
part of the stove or range, where the contents will keep hot but not boil; then 
stir in four well-beaten yolks of eggs; do not allow the terrapin to boil after add- 
ing the eggs, but pour it immediately into a tureen containing a gfll of good 
Madeira and a tablespoonfvd of lemon juice. Serve hot. 

STEWED TERRAPIN. 

Plunge the terrapins alive into boiling water, and let them remain untU the 
sides and lower shell begin to crack — this wiU take less than an hour; then re- 
move them and let them get cold; take off the shell and outer skin, being care- 
ful to save all the blood possible in opening them. If there are eggs in them put 
them aside in a dish; take all the inside out, and be very careful not to break 
the gall, which must be immediately removed or it will make the rest bitter. 
It lies within the hver. Then cut up the Uver and aU the rest of the terrapin 
into small pieces, adding the blood and juice that have flowed out in cutting up; 
add half a pint of water; sprinkle a Uttle flour over them as you place them in 
the stew-pan; let them stew slowly ten minutes, adding salt, black and cayenne 
pepper, and a very smaU blade of mace; then add a giU of the best brandy and 
half a pint of the very best sherry wine; let it simmer over a slow fire very 
gently. About ten minutes or so, before you are ready to dish them, add half a 
pint of rich cream, and half a pound of sweet butter, with flour, to prevent boil- 



SHELL-FISH. 59 

ing; two or three minutes before taking them off the fire, peel the eggs carefully 

and throw them in whole. If there should be no eggs use the yolk of hens' eggs, 

hard boiled. This receipt is for four terrapins.

BOILED LOBSTER. 

Put a handful of salt into a large kettle or pot of boiling water. When the 
water boils very hard, put in the lobster, having first brushed it, and tied the 
claws together with a bit of twine. Keep it boUing from 20 minutes to half an hour 
in proportion to its size. If boUed too long the meat wiU be hard and stringy. 
When it is done take it out, lay it on its claws to drain, and then wipe it dry. 

It is scarcely necessary to mention that the head of a lobster, and what are 
called the lady-fingers, are not to be eaten. 

Very large lobsters are not the best, the meat being coarse and tough. The 
male is best for boiling; the flesh is firmer, and the shell a brighter red; it may 
readily be distiaguished from the female; the taU is narrower, and the two up- 
per-most fins within the tail are stiff and hard. Those of the hen lobster are 
not so, and the tail is broader. 

Hen lobsters are preferred for sauce or salad, on account of their coral. The 
head and small claws are never used. 

They should be aUve and freshly caught when put into the boihng kettle. 
After being cooked and cooled, spht open the body and tail, and crack the claws, 
to extract the meat. The sand pouch found near the throat should be removed. 
Care should be exercised that none of the feathery, tough, gUl-hke particles 
foimd under the body shell get mixed with the meat, as they are indigestible, 
and have caused much trouble. They are supposed to be the cause of so-called 
poisoning from eating lobster. 

Serve on a platter. Lettuce, and other concomitants of a salad, should also be 
placed on the table or platter. 

SCALLOPED LOBSTER. 

Butter a deep dish, and cover the bottom with fine bread-crumbs; put on this 
a layer of chopped lobster, with pepper and salt; so on alternately until the dish is 
filled, having crumbs on top. Put on bits of butter, moisten with milk, and 
bake about twenty minutes. 

DEVILED LOBSTER. 

Take out aU the meat from a boUed lobster, reserving the coral; season highly 
with mustard, cayenne, salt and some kind of table sauce; stew until weU mixed. 



6o SHELL-FISH. 

and put it in a covered sauce-pan, with just enough hot water to keep from 
burning; rub the coral smooth, moistening with vinegar until it is thin enough 
to pour easily, then stir it into the sauce-pan. The dressing should be prepared 
before the meat is put on the fire, and which ought to boil but once before the 
coral is put in; stir in a heaping teaspoonful of butter, and when it boUs again it 
is done, and should be taken up at once, as too much cooking toughens the 
meat. 

LOBSTER CROQUETTES. 

Take any of the lobster remaining from table, and pound it until the dark, 
light meat and coral are well mixed; put with it not quite as much fine bread- 
crumbs; season with pepper, salt and a very httle cayenne pepper; add a little 
melted butter, about two tablespoonfuls if the bread is rather dry; form into 
egg-shaped or round balls; roU them in egg, then in fine crumbs, and fry in boil- 
ing lard. 

LOBSTER PATTIES. 

Cut some boiled lobster in small pieces; then take the small claws and the 
spawn, put them in a suitable dish, and jam them to a paste with a potato 
masher. Now add to them a ladleful of gravy or both, with a few bread-crumbs: 
set it over the fire and boU; strain it through a strainer, or sieve, to the thickn'sss 
of a cream, and put haE of it to your lobsters, and save the other half to sauce 
them with after they are baked. Put to the lobster the bigness of an egg of 
butter, a httle pepper and salt; squeeze in a lemon, and warm these over the fire 
enough to melt the butter, set it to cool, and sheet your patty-pan or a plate or 
dish with good puff paste; then put in your lobster, and cover it with a paste; 
bake it within three-quarters of an hour before you want it; when it is baked, 
cut up your cover, and warm up the other half of your sauce above mentioned, 
with a httle butter, to the thickness of cream, and pour it over your patty, with 
a httle squeezed lemon; cut your cover in two, and lay it on the top, two inches 
distant, so that what is under may be seen. You may bake crawfish, shrimps 
or prawns the same way; and they are aU proper for plates or httle dishes for a 
second course. 

LOBSTER A LA NEWBURG. 

Take one whole lobster, cut up in pieces about as large as a hickory nut. Put in 
the same pan with a piece of butter size of a walnut, season with salt and pepper 
to taste, and thicken with heavy cream sauce ; add the yolk of one egg and two oz. 
of sherry wine. 



SHELL-FISH. 6? 

Cream Sauce for above is made as follows : 1 oz. butter, melted in sauce pan, 

2 oz. flour, mixed with butter; thin down to proper consistency with boiling 

cream. 

— Rector's Oyster House, Chicago, 

BAKED CRABS. 

Mix with the contents of a can of crabs, bread-crumbs or pounded crackers. 
Pepper and salt the whole to taste; mince some cold ham; have the baking-pan 
well buttered, place therein first a layer of the crab meat, prepared as above, 
then a layer of the minced ham, and so on, alternating until the pan is filled. 
Cover the top with bread-crumbs and bits of butter, and bake. 

DEVILED CRABS. 

HaK a dozen fresh crabs, boiled and minced, two ounces of butter, one small 
teaspoonfvil of mustard powder; cayenne pepper and salt to taste. Put the 
meat into a bowl and mix carefully with it an equal quantity of fine bread- 
crumbs. Work the butter to a hght cream, mix the mustard weU with it, then 
stir in very carefully, a handful at a time, the mixed crabs, a tablespoonf ul of 
cream, and crumbs. Season to taste with cayenne pepper and salt: fill the crab 
shells with the mixture, sprinkle bread-crumbs over the tops, put three smaH 
pieces of butter upon the top of each, and brown them quickly in a hot oven. 
They will puff in baking and will be found very nice. Half the quantity can be 
made A crab-sheU will hold the meat of two crabs. 

CRAB CROQUETTES. 

Pick the meat of boiled crabs and chop it fine. Season to taste with pepper, 
salt and melted butter. Moisten it well with rich milk or cream, then stiffen it 
sUghtly with bread or cracker-crumbs. Add two or three weU-beaten eggs to 
bind the mixture. Form the croquettes, egg and bread-crumb them and fry 
them delicately in boiUng lard. It is better to use a wire frying-basket for cro- 
quettes of aU kinds. 

TO MAKE A CRAB PIE. 

Procure the crabs alive, and put them in boilLng water, along with some salt. 
Boil them for a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, according to the size. 
When cold, pick the meat from the claws and body. Chop all together, and 
mix it with crumbs of bread, pepper and salt, and a little butter. Put aU this 
into the shell, and brown in a hot oven. A crab-sheU will hold the meat of two 
crabs. 



62 SHELL-FISH. 

CRABS. (Soft Shell.) 

Crabs may be boiled as lobsters. They make a fine dish when stewed. Take 
out the meat from the shell, put it into a sauce-pan with butter, pepper, salt, a 
pinch of mace, and a very little water; dredge with flour, and let simmer five 
minutes over a slow fire. Serve hot; garnish the dish with the claws laid 
around it. 

The usual way of cooking them is frying them in plenty of butter and lard 
mixed; prepare them the same as frying fish. The spongy substance from the 
sides should be taken off, also the sand bag. Fry a nice brown, and garnish 
with parsley. 

OYSTERS. 

Oysters must be fresh and fat to be good. They are in season from Septem- 
ber to May. 

The small ones, such as are sold by the quart, are good for pies, fritters, or 
stews; the largest of this sort are nice for frying or pickUng for family use. 

FRIED OYSTERS. 

Take large oysters from their own Uquor into a thickly folded napkin to dry 
them; then make hot an ounce each of butter and lard, in a thick -bottom fry- 
ing-pan. Season the oysters with pepper and salt, then dip each one into egg 
and cracker-crumbs roUed fine, imtil it will take up no more. Place them in the 
hot grease and fry them a delicate brown, turning them on both sides by sliding 

u broad-bladed knife under them. Serve them crisp and hot. 

— Boston Oyster House. 

Some prefer to roU oysters in corn-meal and others use fiour, but they are 

much more crisp with egg and cracker-crumbs. 

OYSTERS FRIED IN BATTER. 

Ingredients. — \ pint of oysters, 2 eggs, \ pint of mfik, sufficient flour to make 
the batter; pepper and salt to taste; when liked, a Uttle nutmeg; hot lard. 

Scald the oysters in their own liquor, beard them, and lay them on a cloth 
to drain thoroughly. Break the eggs into a basin, mix the flour with them, add 
the milk gradually, with nutmeg and seasoning, and put the oysters in a batter. 
. Make some lard hot in a deep frying-pan; put in the oysters, one at a time; when 
done, take them up with a sharp-pointed skewer, and dish them on a napkin. 
Fried oysters are frequently used for garnishing boiled fish, and then a few 
bread-crumbs should be added to the flour. 



SHELL-FISH. 63 

STEWED OYSTERS. (In Milk or Cream.) 
Drain the liquor from two quarts of oysters; mix with it a small teacupful 
of hot water, add a httle salt and pepper, and set it over the fire in a sauce-pan. 
Let it boil up once, put in the oysters, let them come to a boil, and when they 
"ruffle" add two tablespoonfuls of butter. The instant it is melted and well 
stirred in, put in a pint of boiling milk, and take the sauce-pan from the fire. 
Serve with oyster or cream crackers. Serve while hot. 

If thickening is preferred, stir in a httle flour or two tablespoonfuls of cracker- 
crumbs. 

PLAIN OYSTER STEW. 

Same as milk or cream stew, using only oyster liquor and water instead of 
milk or cream, adding more butter after taking up. 

OYSTER SOUP. 

For oyster soup, see Soups. 

DRY OYSTER STEW. 

Take six to twelve large oysters and cook them in half a pint of their own 
liquor; season with butter and white pepper; cook for five minutes, stirring con- 
stantly. Serve in hot soup-plates or bowls. 

— Fulton Market, New York. 

BOSTON FRY. 

Prepare the oysters in egg batter and fine cracker meal; fry in butter over a 

slow fire for about ten minutes; cover the hollow of a hot platter with tomato 

sauce; place the oysters in it, but not covering; garnished with chopped parsley 

sprinkled over the oysters. 

— Boston Oyster House. 

BROILED OYSTERS. 

Dry a quart of oysters in a cloth, dip each in melted butter well peppered; 
then in beaten egg, or not, then in bread or cracker-crumbs, also peppered. 
Broil on a wire broiler over hve coals, three to five minutes. Dip over each a 
little melted butter. Serve hot. 

ROAST OYSTERS IN THE SHELL. 

Select the large ones, those usually termed " Saddle Eocks," formerly known 
as a distinct variety, but which are now but the large oysters selected from any 
keds; wash and wipe them, and place with the upper or deep shell down, to 



^4 SHELL-FISH. 

catch the juice, over or on live coals. When thfey open their shells, remove the 
shallow one, being careful to save all the juice in the other; place them, shells and 
aU, on a hot platter, and send to table hot, to be seasoned by each person with 
butter and pepper to taste. If the oysters are fine, and they are just cooked 
enough and served all hot, this is, -par excellence, the style. 

OYSTER ROAST. No. 2. 

Put one quart of oysters in a basin with their own liquor and let them boil 
three or four minutes; season with a Uttle salt, pepper and a heaping spoonful 
j)f butter. Serve on buttered toast. 

STEAMED OYSTERS. 

Wash and drain a quart of counts or select oysters; put them in a shallow 
pan and place in a steamer over boihng water; cover and steam tiU they are 
plump, with the edges ruffled, but no longer. Place in a heated dish, with but- 
ter, pepper and salt, and serve. 

— Baltimore Style, 

STEAMED OYSTERS IN THE SHELL. 

Wash and place them in an air-tight vessel, laying them the upper shell 
downward, so that the liquor will not run out when they open. Place this dish 
or vessel over a pot of boiling water where they will get the steam. Boil them 
rapidly untU the sheUs open, about fifteen to twenty minutes. Serve at once 
while hot. seasoned with butter, salt and pepper. 

PAN OYSTERS. No. i. 

Cut some stale bread in thin slices, taking off all the crust; rovmd the slices 

to fit patty -pans, toast, butter, place them in the pans and moisten with three or 

four teaspoonfuls of oyster Uquor; place on the toast a layer of oysters, sprinkle 

with pepper, and put a small piece of butter on top of each pan; place all the 

pans in a baking-pan, and place in the oven, covering tightly. They will cook 

in seven or eight minutes if the oven is hot; or, cook till the beards are ruffled; 

remove the cover, sprinkle lightly with salt, replace, and cook one minute 

longer. Serve in patty-pans. They are delicious. 

— New York Style. 

PAN OYSTERS. No. 2. 

Lay in a thin pie-tin or dripping-pan half a pint of large oysters, or more if 
required; have the pan large enough so that each oyster wiU lie flat on the bot- 



SHELL-FISH. 65 

torn; put in over them a Kttle oyster liquor, but not enough to float; place them 

carefully in a hot oven and just heat them through thoroughly — do not bake 

them — which will be in three to five minutes, according to fire; take them up 

and place on toast; first moistened with the hot juice from the pan. Are a very 

good substitute for oysters roasted in the shell, the slow cooking bringing out 

the flavor. 

— French Restaurant, New Orleans, La. 

OifSTER FRITTERS. 

Select plump, good-sized oysters; drain off the juice, and to a cup of this 
juice add a cup of rmlk, a little salt, four well-beaten eggs, and flour enough to 
make batter like griddle-cakes. 

Envelop an oyster in a spoonful of this batter, (some cut them in halves or 
chop them fine,) then fry in butter and lard, mixed in a frying-pan the same as 
we fry eggs, turning to fry brown on both sides. Send to the table very hot. 

— Delmonico. 

Most cooks fry oyster fritters the same as crullers, in a quantity of hot 
lard, but this is not always convenient; either way they are excellent. 

OYSIER PATTIES. 

Line patty-pans with thin pasjry, pressing it well to the tin. Put a piece 
of bread or a ball of paper in each. Cover them with paste and brush them over 
with the white of an egg. Cut an inch square of thin pastry, place on the 
centre of each, glaze this also vnth egg, and bake in a qmck oven fifteen to 
twenty minutes. Eemove the bread or paper when half cold. 

Scald as many oysters as you require (allowing two for each patty, three if 
small) in their own Uquor. Cut each in four and strain the liquor. Put two 
tablespoonfuls of butter and two of flour into a thick sauce-pan; stir them 
together over the fire tOl the flour smells cooked, and then pour half a pint of 
oyster liquor and half a pint of milk into the flour and butter. (If you have 
cream, use it instead of milk.) Stir till it is a thick, smooth sauce. Put the 
oysters into it and let them boil once. Beat the yolks of two eggs. Eemove 
the oysters for one minute from the fire, then stir the eggs into them tiU the 
sauce looks hke thick custard. 

FiU the patties with this oyster fricassee, taking care to make it hot by stand- 
ing in boiling water before dinner on the day required, and to make the patty 
<ases hot before you flU them. 



66 SHELL-FISH. 

FULTON MARKET ROAST. 

It is still known in New York from the place at which it was and is stiU 
served. Take nine large oysters in the shell; wash, dry and roast over a char- 
coal fire, on a broUer. Two miautes after the sheUs open they wiU be done. 
Take them up quickly, saving the juice in a small, shallow, tin pan; keep hot 
imtil all are done; butter them and sprinkle with pepper. 

This is served for one person when calling for a roast of this kind. It is often 
poured over a slice of toast. 

SCALLOPED OYSTERS. 

Have ready about a pint bowl of fine cracker-crumbs. Butter a deep earthen 
dish; put a layer of the cracker-crumbs on the bottom; wet this with some of 
the oyster Uquor; next have a layer of oysters; sprinkle with salt and pepper, 
and lay small bits of butter upon them; then another layer of cracker-crumbs 
and oyster juice; then oysters, pepper, salt and butter, and so on, until the dish 
is full; the top layer to be cracker-crumbs. Beat up an egg in a cup of milk and 
turn over all. Cover the dish and set it in the oven for thirty or forty-five minutes. 
When baked through, uncover the top, set on the upper grate and brown. 

OYSTER POT-PIE. 

Scald a quart can of oysters in their own liquor; when it boils, skim out th'? 

oysters and set aside in a warm place. To the hquor add a pint of hot water; 

season well with salt and pepper, a generous piece of butter, thicken with flour 

and cold milk. Have ready nice Ught biscuit dough, rolled twice as thick as 

pie-crust; cut out into inch squares, drop them into the boUing stew, cover closely, 

and cook forty minutes. When taken up, stir the oysters into the juice and 

serve all together in one dish. A nice side entrSe. 

— Prince's Bay, 8.1. 

BOSTON OYSTER PIE. 

Having buttered the inside of a deep pie-plate, line it with puff-paste, or 

common pie-crust, and prepare another sheet of paste for the hd; put a clean 

towel into the dish (folded so as to support the Ud), set it into the oven and bake 

the paste well; when done, remove the lid and take out the towel. While the 

paste is baking prepare the oysters. Having picked oflf carefully every bit of 

shell that may be found about them, drain oflf the liquor into a pan and put the 

oysters into a stew-pan with barely enough of the liquor to keep them from 

burning; season them with pepper, salt and butter; add a little sweet cream 

or milk, and one or two crackers rolled fine; let the oysters simmer, but not 



SHELL-FISH. 67 

toil, as that will shrivel them. Eemove the upper crust of pastry and fill the 
dish with the oysters and gravy; replace the cover and serve hot. 

Some prefer haking the upper crust on a pie-plate, the same size as the pie, 
then slipping it off on top of the pie after the same is filled with the oysters. 

MOCK OYSTERS. 

Grate the com, while green and tender, with a coarse grater, into a deep 
Jish. To two ears of corn, allow one egg; beat the whites and yolks separately, 
and add them to the com, with one tablespoonful of wheat flour and one of 
butter, a teaspoonful of salt and pepper to taste. Drop spoonfuls of this batter 
into a frying-pan with hot butter and lard mixed, and fry a Ught brown on both 
sides. 

In taste, they have a singular resemblance to fried oysters. The com must 
be young. 

FRICASSEED OYSTERS. 

Take a slice of raw ham, which has been pickled, but not smoked, and soak 
tn boiling water for half an hour; cut it in quite small pieces, and put in a sauce- 
pan with two-thirds of a pint of veal or chicken broth, well' strained; the liquor 
from a quart of oysters, one small onion, minced fine, and a Uttle chopped 
parsley, sweet marjoram, and pepper; let them simmer for twenty minutes, and 
then boU rapidly two or three minutes; skim well, and add one scant table- 
spoonful of corn-starch, mixed smoothly in one-third cup of milk; stir constantly, 
and when it boils add the oysters and one ounce of butter; after which, just let 
it come to a boil, and remove the oysters to a deep dish; beat one egg, and add 
to it gradually some .f the hot broth, and, when cooked, stir it into the pan; 
season with salt, and pour the whole over the oysters. When placed upon the 
table, squeeze the juice of a lemon over it. 

SMALL OYSTER PIES. 

For each pie take a tin plate half the size of an ordinary dinner plate; butter 
it, and cover the bottom with a puff paste, as for pies; lay on it five or six select 
oysters, or enough to cover the bottom; butter them and season with a little salt 
and plenty of pepper; spread over this an egg batter, and cover with a crust of 
the paste, making small openings in it with a fork. Bake in a hot oven fifteen 
to twenty minutes, or until the top is nicely browned.

STEWED CLAMS. 

Wash clean as many rovmd clams as required; pile them in a large iron pot, 
with half a cupful of hot water in the bottom, and put over the fire; as soon as 
the shells open, take out the clams, cut off the hard, uneatable "fringe" from 
each, with strong, clean scissors, put them into a stew-pan with the broth from 
the pot, and boU slowly tUl they are quite tender; pepper well, and thicken the 
gravy with flour, stirred into melted butter. 

Or, you may get two dozen freshly opened very small clams. Boil a pint of 
milk, a dash of white pepper and a smaU pat of butter. Now add the clams. 
Let them come to a boU, and serve. Longer boiling will make the clams almost 
indigestible. 

ROAST CLAMS IN THE SHELL. 

Eoast in a pan over a hot fire, or in a hot oven, or, at a " 01am Bake," on hot 

stones; when they open, empty the juice into a sauce-pan; add the clams with 

butter, pepper and a very Uttle salt.

Take fifty small or twenty-five large sand clams from their shells; if large, 
cut each in two,- lay them on a thickly folded napkin; put a pint bowl of wheat 
flour into a basin, add to it three weU-beaten eggs, half a pint of sweet milk, 
and nearly as much of their own hquor; beat the batter until it is smooth and 
perfectly free from lumps; then stir in the clams. Put plenty of lard or beef fat 
into a thick-bottomed frying-pan, let it become boiling hot; put in the batter by 
the spoonful; let them fry gently; when one side is a dehcate brown, turn the 
other. 

CLAM CHOWDER. 

The materials needed are fifty round clams (quahogs), a large bowl of salt 
pork, cut up fine, the same of onions, finely chopped, and the same (or more, if 
you desire,) of potatoes cut into eighths or sixteenths of original size; wash the 
clams very thoroughly, and put them in a pot with half a pint of water; when 
the shells are open they are done; then take them from the shells and chop fine, 
saving aU the clam water for the chowder; fry out the pork very gently, and 
when the scraps are a good brown, take them out and put in the chopped 
onions to fry; they should be fried in a frying-pan, and the chowder-kettle be 
made very clean before they are put in it, or the chowder will bum. (The 
chief secret in chowder-making is to fry the onions so delicately that they will 
be missing in the chowder.) 



SHELL-FISH. 69 

Add a quart of hot water to the onions; put in the clams, clam- water and 
pork scraps. After it boUs, add the potatoes, and when they are cooked, the 
chowder is fioished. Just before it is taken up, thicken it with a cup of pow- 
dered crackers, and add a quart of fresh mOk. If too rich, add more water. No 
seasoning is needed but good black pepper. 

With the addition of six shced tomatoes, or half a can of the canned ones, 
tliis is the best recipe of this kind, and is served in many of our best restaurants.

SCALLOPED CLAMS. 

Purchase a dozen large soft clams in the shell and three dozen opened clams. 
Ask the dealer to open the first dozen, care being used not to injure the sheUs, 
which are to be used in cooking the clams. Clean the shells well, and put two 
soft clams on each half sheU; add to each a dash of white pepper, and half a 
teaspoonful of minced celery. Out a slice of fat bacon into the smallest dice, add 
four of these to each shell, strew over the top a thin layer of cracker-dust; place 
a piece of table butter on top, and bake in the oven until brown. They are 
deUghtful when properly prepared. 

SCALLOPS. 

If bought in the shell boil them and take out the hearts, which is the only 
part used. Dip them in beaten egg, and fry in the same manner as oysters. 
Some prefer them stewed the same as oysters. 

FROGS FRIED. 

Frogs are usually fried, and are considered a great aehcacy. Only the hind- 
legs and quarters are used. Clean them well, season, and fry in egg batter, or 
dipped in beaten egg and fine cracker-crumbs, the same as oysters. 

FROGS STEWED. 

Wash and skin the quarters, parboil them about three minutes, drain them. 
Now, put into a stew-pan two ounces of butter. When it is melted, lay in the 
frogs, and fry about two minutes, stirring them to prevent burning; shake over 
them a tablespoonful of sifted flour and stir it into them; add a sprig of parsley, 
a pinch of powdered summer savory, a bay leaf, three sHces of onion, salt and 
pepper, a cup of hot water and one of cream. Boil gently until done; remove 
the legs, strain and mix into the gravy the yolks of two eggs, well beaten to a 
cream; put the legs in a suitable dish, pour over the gravy and serve. 



In choosing poultry, select those that are fresh and fat, and the surest way 
to determine whether they are young, is to try the skin under the leg or wing. 
If it is easily broken, it is young; or, turn the wing backwards, if the joint yields 
readily, it is tender. When poultry is young the skin is thin and tender, the 
legs smooth, the feet moist and limber, and the eyes full and bright. The body 
should be thick and the breast fat. Old turkeys have long hairs, and the flesh 
is purphsh where it shows under the skin on the legs and back. About March 
they deteriorate in quaUty. 

Young ducks and geese are plump, with light, semi-transparent fat, soft 
breast-bone, tender flesh, leg- joints which wfll break by the weight of the bird, 
fresh-colored and brittle beaks, and wind -pipes that break when pressed between 
the thumb and forefinger. They are best in faU and winter. 

YoTxng pigeons have light red flesh upon the breast, and fuU, fresh-colored 
legs; when the legs are thin and the breast very dark the birds are old. 

Fine game birds are always heavy for their size; the flesh of the breast is 
firm and plump, and the skin clear; and if a few feathers be plucked from the 
inside of the leg and around the vent, the flesh of freshly-kiUed birds wiU be fat 
and fresh-colored; if it is dark and discolored, the game has been hung a long 
time. The wings of good ducks, geese, pheasants, and woodcock are tender to 
the touch; the tips of the long wing feathers of partridges are pointed in young 
birds and round in old ones. Quail, snipe and small birds shovild have fuU, 
tender breasts. Poultry should never be cooked until six or eight hours after it 
has been killed, but it should be picked and drawn as soon as possible. Plunge 
it in a pot of scalding hot water; then pluck off the feathers, taking care not to 
tear the skin; when it is picked clean, roU up a piece of white paper, set fire to 
it, and singe off all the hairs. The head, neck and feet should be cut off, and 
the ends of the legs skewered to the body, and a string tied tightly around the 
hody. When roastiag a chicken or small fowl there is danger of the legs brown- 



POULTRY AND GAME. 7 1 

ing or bev>oming too hard to be eaten. To avoid this, take strips of cloth, dip 
them into a httle melted lard, or even just rub them over with lard, and wind 
them around the legs. Remove them in time to allow the legs to brown defli- 
cately. 

Fowls, and also various kinds of game, when bought at our city markets, 
require a more thorough cleansing than those sold in country places, where as a 
general thing the meat is whoUy dressed. In large cities they lay for some 
length of time with the intestines undrawn, imtil the flavor of them diffuses itself 
all through the meat, rendering it distasteful. In this case, it is safe after taking 
out the intestines, to rinse out in several waters, and in next to the last water, 
add a teaspoonful of baking soda; say to a quart of water. This process neutral- 
izes all sourness, and helps to destroy all unpleasant taste in the meat. 

Poultry may be baked so that its wings and legs are soft and tender, by being 
placed in a deep roasting pan with close cover, thereby retaining the aroma and 
essences by absorption while confined. These pans are a recent innovation, and 
are made double with a small opening in the top for giving vent to the accumu- 
lation of steam and gases when required. Roast meats of any kind can also be 
cooked in the same manner, and it is a great improvement on the old plan. 

ROAST TURKEY, 

Select a young turkey; remove all the feathers carefully, singe it over a burn- 
ing newspaper on the top of the stove; then " draw " it nicely, being very care- 
ful not to break any of the internal organs; remove the crop carefully; cut off 
the head, and tie the neck close to the body by drawing the skin over it. Now 
rinse the inside of the turkey out with several waters, and in the next to the 
last, mix a teaspoonful of baking soda; oftentimes the inside of a fowl is very 
sour, especially if it is not freshly killed. Soda, being cleansing, acts as a cor- 
rective, and destroys that impleasant taste which we frequently experience in the 
dressing when fowls have been killed for some time. Now, after washing, wipe 
the turkey dry, inside and out, with a clean cloth, rub the inside with some salt, 
then stuff the breast and body with " Dressing for Fowls." Then sew up the 
turkey with a strong thread, tie the legs and wings to the body, rub it over with 
a little soft butter, sprinkle over some salt and pepper, dredge with a httle flour; 
place it in a dripping pan, pour in a cup of boiling water, and set it in the oven. 
Baste the turkey often, turning it around occasionally so that every part wiU be 
uniformly baked. When pierced with a fork and the hquid runs out perfectly 
clear, the bird is done- If any part is hkely to scorch, pin over it a piece of but-

tered white paper. A fifteen-pound turkey requires between three and four 
hours to bake. Serve with cranberry sauce. 

Gravy for Turkey.— When you put the turkey in to roast, put the neck, 
heart, liver and gizzard into a stew-pan with a pint of water; boil imtil they 
become quite tender'; take them out of the water, chop the heart and gizzard, 
mash the liver and throw away the neck; return the chopped heart, gizzard and 
hver to the liquor in which they were stewed; set it to one side, and when the 
turkey is done it should be added to the gravy that dripped from the turkey, 
having first skimmed off the fat from the surface of the dripping-pan; set it all 
over the fire, boil three minutes and thicken with flour. It will not need brown 
flour to color the gravy. The garnishes for turkey or chicken are fried oysters, 
thin slices of ham, sUces of lemon, fried sausages, or force-meat balls, also 
parsley. 

DRESSING OR STUFFING FOR FOWLS. 

For an eight or ten pound turkey, cut the brown crust from slices or pieces 
of stale bread until you have as much as the inside of a pound loaf; put it into a 
suitable dish, and pour tepid water (not warm, for that makes it heavy) over it; 
let it stand one minute, as it soaks very quickly. Now take up a handful at a 
time and squeeze it hard and dry with both hands, placing it, as you go along, in 
another dish; this process makes it very light. When aU is pressed dry, toss it 
an up lightly through your fingers; now add pepper, salt, — about a teaspoonful 
— also a teaspoonful of powdered summer savory, the same amount of sage, or 
the green herb minced fine; add half a cup of melted butter, and a beaten egg, 
or not. Work thoroughly all together, and it is ready for dressing either fowls, 
fish or meats. A little chopped sausage in turkey dressing is considered by some 
an improvement, when well incorporated with the other ingredients. For geese 
and ducks the stuffing may be made the same as for tm-key with the addition 
of a few slices of onion chopped fine. 

OYSTER DRESSING OR STUFFING. 

This is made with the same ingredients as the above, with the exception of 
half a can of oysters drained, and slightly chopped and added to the rest. This 
is used mostly with boiled turkey and chicken, and the remainder of the can of 
oysters used to make an oyster sauce to be poured over the turkey when served; 
served generally in a separate dish, to be dipped out as a person desires. 

These recipes were obtained from an old colored cook, who was famous for 
his fine dressings for fowls, fish and meats, and his advice was, always soak 



PO UL TR V AND GAME. 73 

stale bread in cold liquid, either milk or water, when used for stuffing or for pud- 
dings, as they were much lighter. Hot liquid makes them heavy. 

BOILED TURKEY. 

Prepare as you would for baking or roasting; fill with an oyster stuffing, 
made as the above. Tie the legs and wings close to the body, place in salted 
boiling water with the breast doAvnward; skim it often and boil about two 
hours, but not tUl the skin breaks. Serve with oyster or celery sauce. Boil a 
nicely pickled piece of salt pork, and serve at table a thin shce to each plate. 
Some prefer bacon or ham instead of pork. 

Some roll the turkey in a cloth dipped in flour. If the liquor is to be used 
afterwards for soup, the cloth imparts an unpleasant flavor. The Hquor can be 
saved and made into a nice soup for the next day's dinner, by adding the same 
seasonings as for chicken soup. 

TURKEY SCALLOP. 
Pick the meat from the bones of cold turkey, and chop it fine. Put a layer 
of bread-crumbs on the bottom of a buttered dish, moisten them with a httle 
nulk, then put in a layer of turkey with some of the fiUing, and cut small pieces 
of butter over the top; sprinkle with pepper and salt; then another layer of 
bread-crumbs, and so on imtil the dish is nearly full; add a little hot water to 
the gravy left from the turkey and pour over it; then take two eggs, two table- 
spoonfiils of milk, one of melted butter, a httle salt and cracker-crumbs as much 
as will make it thick enough to spread on with a knife; put bits of butter over 
it, and cover with a plate. Bake three-quarters of an hour. Ten minutes before 
serving, remove the plate and let it brown. 

TURKEY HASHED. 

Cut the remnants of turkey from a previous dinner into pieces of equai size. 
Bon the bones in a quart of water, until the quart is reduced to a pint; then take 
out the bones, and to the hquor in which they were boiled add turkey gravy, 
if you have any, or white stock, or a small piece of butter with salt and pepper; 
let the hquor thus prepared boil up once; then put in the pieces of turkey, dredge 
in a httle flour, give it one boil-up, and serve in a hot dish. 

TURKEY WARMED OVER. 
Pieces of cold turkey or chicken may be warmed up with a httle butter in a 
frying-pan; place it on a warm platter, surround it with pieces of small thick 
shoes of bread or biscuit halved, first dipping them in hot salted water; then 



74 POULTRY AND GAME. 

place the platter in a warm oven with the door open. Have already made the 
following gravy to pour over all: 

Into the frying-pan prrt a large spoonful of butter, one or two cupfuls of 
milk, and any gravy that may be left over. Bring it to a boil; then add suffi- 
cient flour, wet in a Uttle cold mUk or water, to make it the consistency of 
cream. Season with salt, pepper and add a little of the dark meat chopped very 
fine. Let the sauce cook a few moments; then pour over the biscuit and fowl. 
This will be found a reaUy nice dish. 

BONED TURKEY. 

Clean the fowl as usual. "With a sharp and pointed knife, begin at the 
extremity of the wing, and pass the knife down close to the bone, cutting all the 
flesh from the bone, and preserving the skin whole; run the knife down each 
side of the breast bone and up the legs, keeping close to the bone; then spht the 
back half way up, and draw out the bones; fill the places whence the bones 
were taken with a stuffing, restoring the fowl to its natural form, and sew up 
all the incisions made in the skin. Lard with two or three rows of shps of fat 
bacon on the top, basting often with salt and water, and a httle butter. Some 
Mke a glass of port wine in the gravy. 

This is a difficult dish to attempt by any but skillful hands. Carve across 
in sHces, and serve with tomato sauce. 

ROAST GOOSE. 

The goose should not oe more than eight months old, and the fatter the more 
tender and juicy the meat. Stuff with the following mixture: Three pints of 
bread-crumbs, six ounces of butter, or part butter and part salt pork, one tea- 
spoonful each of sage, black pepper and salt, one chopped onion. Do not stuff 
very fuU, and stitch openings firmly together to keep flavor in and fat out. 
Place in a baking pan with a httle water, and baste frequently with salt and 
water (some add vinegar); turn often so that the sides and back may be nicely 
browned. Bake two hours or more; when done take from the pan, pour off the 
fat, and to the brown gravy left, add the chopped giblets which have previously 
been stewed imtil tender, together with the water they were boiled in; thicken 
with a httle flom- and butter rubbed together, bring to a boU and serve. Enghsh 
style.

wfeii with a clean cloth, and fill the crop and body with a stuffing the same as 
•' Dressing for Fowls." Lay it in a dripping-pan; put a pint of hot water and a 
piece of butter in the dripping-pan, add to it a small tablespoonful of salt, and a 
small teaspoonful of pepper; baste frequently, and let it roast quickly, without 
scorching; when nearly done, put a piece of butter the size of a large egg to the 
water in the pan; when it melts, baste with it, dredge a httle flour over, baste 
again, and let it finish; half an hour will roast a full-grown chicken, if the fire 
is right. When done, take it up. 

Having stewed the necks, gizzards, hvers and hearts in a very little water, 
strain it and rni-y it hot with the gravy that has dripped from the fowls, and 
which must be first skimmed. Thicken it with a httle browned flour, add to it 
the hvers, hearts and gizzards chopped smaU. Or, put the giblets in the pan 
with the chicken, and let them roast. Send the fowls to the table with the 
gravy in a boat. Cranberry sauce should accompany them, or any tart sauce. 

BOILED CHICKEN. 

Clean, wash and stuff, as for roasting. Baste a floured cloth arotmd each, 
and put into a pot with enough boiling water to cover them well. The hot 
water cooks the skin at once and prevents the escape of the juice. The broth 
will not be so rich as if the fowls are put on in cold water, but this is a proof 
that the meat will be more nutritious and better flavored. Stew very slowly, 
for the first half hour especially. Boil an hour or more, guiding yourself by 
size and toughness. Serve with egg, bread, or oyster sauce. (See Sauces.) 

STEAMED CHICKEN. 

Eub the chicken on the inside with pepper and half a teaspoonful of salt; 
place in a steamer in a kettle that will keep it as near the water as possible, 
cover, and steam an hour and a half; when done, keep hot while dressing is 
prepared, then cut up, arrange on the platter, and serve with the dressing over 
them. 

The dressing is made as foUows: Bofl one pint of gravy from the kettle with 
out the fat, add cayenne pepper and half a teaspoonful of salt; stir a tablespoonful 
of flour into a" quarter of a pint of cream until smooth, and add to the gravy 
Com starch may be used instead of the flour, and some cooks add nutmeg oi 
celery salt.

water to cover them. Cover closely, and let them heat very slowly; then stew

them over an hour, or until tender. If they are old chickens, they will require 
long, slow boiling, often from three to four hours. When tender, season with 
salt and pepper, a piece of butter as large as an egg, and a httle celery, if hked. 
Stir up two tablespoonf uls of flour in a httle water or mUk, and add to the stew, 
also two well-beaten yolks of eggs; let all boil up one minute; arrange the chicken 
on a warm platter, pour some of the gravy over it, and send the rest to the table 
in a boat. The egg shonM be added to a httle of the cooled gravy, before putting 
with th- ho^ gravy, 

STEWED WHOLE SPRING CHICKEN. 

Dress a full-grown spring chicken the same as for roasting, seasoning it with 
salt and pepper inside and out; then fill the body with oysters; place it in a tin 
pail with a close-fitting cover. Set the pail in a pot of fast-boiling water and 
cook until the chicken is tender. Dish up the chicken on a warm dish, then 
pour the gravy into a sauce-pan, put into it a tablespoonful )f butter, half of a 
cupful of cream or rich milk, three hard-boiled eggs chopped fine; some minced 
herbs and a tablespoonful of flour. Let all boil up and then pour it over the 
chicken. Serve hot. 

PICKLED CHICKEN. 

Boil four chickens tiU tender enough for meat to fall from bones: put meat 
in a stone jar, and pour over it three pints of cold, good cider vinegar and a pint 
and a half of the water in which the chickens were boiled; add spices if preferred, 
and it will be ready for use in two days. This is a popular Sunday evening dish; 
it is good for luncheon at any time. 

RISSOLES OF CHICKEN. 

Mince up finely the remains of a cold chicken together with half the quan- 
tity of lean, cold ham. Mix them well, adding enough white sauce to moisten 
them. N~w have light paste rolled out until about a quarter of an inch or a 
little more in thicknest; Cut the paste into pieces, one inch by two in size, and 
lay a httle of the mixtui upon the centres of half of the pieces and cover them 
with the other halves, pressing the edges neatly together and forming them into 
httle roUs. Have your fryiUj^-pan ready with plenty of boiling hot lard, or other 
frying medium, and fry until they become a golden -brown color. A minute or 
two win be sufficient for this. Then drain them well and serve immediately on 
a napkin. 



PO UL TR V AND GAME. T] 

CHICKEN PATTIES. 

Mince up fine cold chicken, either roasted or boiled. Season it with pepper 
and salt, and a little minced parsley and onion. Moisten it with chicken gravy 
or cream sauce, fill scalloped shells that are hned with pastry with the mixture, 
and sprinkle bread-crumbs over the tops. Put two or three tiny pieces of butter 
over each, and bake brown in a hot oven. 

TO BROIL CHICKEN. 

After dressing and washing the chickens as previously directed, split them 
open through the back-bone; frog them by cutting the cords under the wings 
and laying the wings out flat; cut the sinews under the second joint of the leg 
and turn the leg down; press down the breast-bone without breaking it. 

Season the chicken with salt and pepper, lay it upon the gridiron with the 
inside first to the fire; put the gridiron over a slow fire, and place a tin sheet and 
weight upon the chicken, to keep it flat; let it broil ten minutes, then turn and 
proceed in the same manner with the other side. 

The chicken should be perfectly cooked, but not scorched. A broiled ehicken 
brought to the table with its wings and legs burnt, and its breast half cooked, is 
very disagreeable. To avoid this, the chicken must be closely watched wMle 
broiling, and the fire must be arranged so that the heat shall be equally dis- 
pensed. When the fire is too hot under any one part of the chicken, put a Uttle 
ashes on the fire under that part, that the heat may be reduced. 

Dish a broiled chicken on a hot plate, putting a large lump of butter and a 
tablespoonful of hot water upon the plate, and tmmng the chicken two or 
three times that it may absorb as much of the butter as possible. Garnish with 
parsley. Serve with poached eggs on a separate dish. It takes from thirty to 
forty minutes to broil a chicken weU. 

CHICKEN PIE. 

Prepare the chicken as for fricassee. When the chickens are stewed tender, 
seasoned, and the gravy thickened, take it from the fire; take out the largest 
bones, scrape the meat from the neck and back-bone, throw the bones away; 
line the sides of a four or six quart pudding-dish with a rich baking powder or soda 
biscuit-dough, a quarter of an inch thick; put in part of the chicken, a few 
lumps of butter, pepper and salt, if needed, some cold boiled eggs cut in slices. 
Add the rest of the chicken and season as before; a few new potatoes in their 
season might be added. Pour over the gravy, being sure to have enough to

fill the dish, and cover with a crust a quarter of an inch thick, made with a hole 
ia the centre the size of a teacup. 

Brush over the top with beaten white of egg, and bake for half to three- 
quarters of an hour. Garnish the top with small bright celery leaves, neatly- 
arranged in a circle. 

FRIED CHICKEN. 

Wash and cut up a young chicken, wipe it dry, season with salt and pepper, 
dredge it with flour, or dip each piece in beaten egg and then iu cracker-crumbs. 
Have in a frying-pan, one ounce each of butter and sweet lard, made boiling hot. 
Lay in the chicken and fry brown on both sides. Take up, drain them, and set 
aside iu a covered dish. Stir into the gravy left, if not too much, a large table- 
spoonful of flour, make it smooth, add a cup of cream or milk, season with salt 
and pepper, boil up and pour over the chicken. Some like chopped parsley 
added to the gravy. Serve hot. 

If the chicken is old, put into a stew-pan with a httle water, and simmer 
gently till tender; season with salt and pepper, dip in flour or cracker-crumb and 
egg, and fry as above. Use the broth the chicken was cooked in to make the 
gravy instead of the cream or milk, or use an equal quantity of both. 

FRIED CHICKEN A LA ITALIENNE. 

Make common batter; mix into it a cupful of chopped tomatoes, one onion 
chopped, some minced parsley, salt and pepper. Cut up young tender chickens, 
dry them weU and dip each piece in the batter; then fry brown in plenty of butter, 
in a thick bottom frying-pan. Serve with tomato sauce. 

CHICKEN CROQUETTES. No. i. 

Put a cup of cream or milk in a sauce-pan, set it over the fire, and when it 
boils add a limip of butter as large as an egg, in which has been mixed a table- 
spoonful of flour. Let it boil up thick; remove from the fire, and when cool, mix 
into it a teaspoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful of pepper, a bit of minced onion 
or parsley, one cup of fine bread-crumbs, and a pint of finely-chopped cooked 
chicken, either roasted or boiled. Lastly, beat up two eggs and work in with the 
whole. Flour your hands and make into small, round, flat cakes; dip in egg 
and bread-crumbs, and fry hke flsh-cakes, in butter and good sweet lard mixed, 
or hke fried cakes in plenty of hot lard. Take them up with a skimmer and lay 
them on brown paper to free them from the grease. Serve hot.

of smoothly mashed potatoes, mix, and season with butter, salt, black pepper, a 
little prepared mustard, and a httle cayenne pepper; make into cakes, dip in egg 
and buead-crumbs and fry a light brown. A nice rehsh for tea. 

TO FRY CROQUETTES. 

Beat up two eggs in a deep bowl; roll enough crackers until you have a cup- 
ftd of crumbs, or the same of fine stale bread-crumbs; spread the crumbs on a 
large plate or pie-tin. Have over the fire a kettle containiug two or three inches 
of boiling lard. As fast as the croquettes are formed, roll them in the crumbs, 
then dip them in the beaten egg, then again roll them in crumbs; drop them in 
the smoking hot fat and fry them a Ught golden brown. 

PRESSED CHICKEN. 

Clean and cut up your chickens. Stew in just enough water to cover them. 
When nearly cooked, season them well with salt and pepper. Let them stew 
down until the water is nearly all boUed out, and the meat drops easily from the 
bones. Eemove the bones and gristle; chop the meat rather coarsely, then turn 
it back into the stew-kettle, where the broth was left (after skimming oflf all fat), 
and let it heat through again. Turn it into a square bread-pan, placing a platter 
on the top, and a heavy weight on the platter. This, if properly prepared, will 
tiun out hke a mold of jelly and may be shced in smooth, even shces. The suc- 
cess of this depends upon not having too much water; it wfil not jeUy if too weak, 
or if the water is allowed to boil away entirely while cooking. A good way to 
cook old fowls. 

CHICKEN LUNCH FOR TRAVELLING. 

Cut a young chicken down the back; wash and wipe dry; season with salt 
and pepper; put in a dripping-pan and bake in a moderate oven three-quarters 
of an hour. This is much better for travelling lunch than when seasoned with 
butter. 

AH kinds of poultry and meat can be cooked quicker by adding to the water 
in which they are boiled a httle vinegar or a piece of lemon. By the use of a 
httle acid there wiU be a considerable saving of fuel, as well as shortening of 
time. Its action is beneficial on old tough meats, rendering them quite tender 
and easy of digestion. Tainted meats and fowls wiU lose their bad taste and

odor if cooked in this way, and if not used too freely no taste of it will be 
acquired. 

POTTED CHICKEN. 

Strip the meat from the bones of a cold, roast fowl; to every pound of meat 
aUow a quarter of a pound of butter, salt and cayenne pepper to taste; one tea- 
spoonful of pounded mace, half a small nutmeg. Cut the meat into small 
pieces, pound it well with the butter, sprinkle in the spices gradually, and keep 
pounding \mtil reduced to a perfectly smooth paste. Pack it into small jars 
and cover with clarified butter, about a quarter of an inch in thickness. Two or 
three shoes of ham, minced and pounded with the above, wiU be an improve- 
ment. Keep in a dry place. A luncheon or breakfast dish. 

Old fowls can be made very tender by putting into them, while boihng, a 
piece of soda as large as a bean. 

SCALLOPED CHICKEN. 

Divide a fowl into joints and boil till the meat leaves the bone readily. Take 
out the bones and chop the meat as small as dice. Thicken the water in which 
the fowl was boUed with flour, and season to taste with butter and salt. FiU a 
deep dish with alternate layers of bread-crumbs and chicken and slices of cooked 
potatoes, having crumbs on top. Pour the gravy over the top, and add a few 
bits of butter and bake tiU nicely browned. There should be gravy enough to 
moisten the dish. Serve with a garnish of parsley. Tiny new potatoes are nice 
in place of sliced ones, when in season. 

BREADED CHICKEN. 

Prepare young chickens as for fricassee by cutting them into pieces. Dip 
each piece in beaten egg, then in grated bread-crumbs or rolled cracker; season 
them with pepper and salt, and a little minced parsley. Place them in a baking- 
pan, and put on the top of each piece a lump of butter, add half of a cupful of 
hot water; bake slowly, basting often. When sufficiently cooked take up on a 
warm platter. Into the pan pour a cup of cream or rich mUk, a cupful of 
bread-crumbs. Stir it well until cooked then pour it over the chicken. Serve 
while hot. 

BROILED CHICKEN ON TOAST. 

Broil the usual way, and when thoroughly done take it up in a square tin or 
dripping-pan, butter it well, season with pepper and salt, and set it in the oven 
for a few minutes. Lay slices of moistened buttered toast on a platter; take the 



POULTRY AND GAME. 8 1 

chicken up over it, add to the gravy in the pan part of a cupful of cream, if you 
have it; if not, use milk. Thicken with a Uttle flour and pour over the chicken. 
This is considered most excellent. 

CURRY CHICKEN. 

Cut up a chicken weighing from a pound and a half to two pounds, as for 
fricassee, wash it well, and put it into a stew-pan with sufficient water to cover it; 
boU it closely covered, until tender; add a large teaspoonful of salt, and cook a few 
minutes longer; then remove from the fire, take out the chicken, pour the Liquor 
into a bowl, and set it one side. Now cut up into the stew-pan two small onions, 
and fry them with a piece of butter as large as an egg; as soon as the onions are 
brown, skim them out and put in the chicken; fry for three or four minutes; 
next sprinkle over two teaspoonfuls of Curry Powder. Now pour over the hquor 
in which the chicken was stewed, stir aU weU together, and stew for five minutes 
longer, then stir into this a tablespoonf ul of sifted flour made thin with a httle 
water; lastly, stir in a beaten yolk of egg, and it is done. 

Serve with hot boiled rice laid round on the edge of a platter, and the chicken 
curry in the centre. 

This makes a handsome side dish, and a flne rehsh accompanying a full 
dinner of roast beef or any roast. 

AU first-class grocers and druggists keep this "India Curry Powder," put 
up in bottles. Beef, veal, mutton, duck, pigeons, partridges, rabbits or fresh 
fish may be substituted for the chicken, if preferred, and sent to the table with 
or without a dish of rice. 

To Boil Bice for Curry. — Pick over the rice, a cupful. Wash it thoroughly 
in two or three cold waters; then leave it about twenty minutes in cold water. 
Put into a stew-pan two quarts of water with a teaspoonful of salt in it, and 
when it boils, sprinkle in the rice. Boil it briskly for twenty minutes, keeping 
the pan covered. Take it from the fire, and drain off the water. Afterwards 
set the sauce-pan on the back of the stove, with the Ud off, to allow the rice to 
dry and the grains to separate. 

Eice, if properly boiled, should be soft and white, and every grain stand 
alone. Serve it hot in a separate dish or served as above, laid around the chicken 
curry. 

CHICKEN POT-PIE. No. i. 

Cut and joint a large chicken, cover with cold water, and let it boil gently 
until tender. Season with salt and pepper, and thicken the gravy with two 



82 po UL TR Y AND GAME. 

tablespoonfuls of flour, mixed smooth with a piece of butter the size of an egg. 
Have ready nice Ught bread-dough; cut with the top of a wineglass about half 
an inch thick; let them stand half an hour and rise, then drop these into the 
boiling gravy. Put the cover on the pot closely, wrap a cloth around it, in order 
that no steam shall escape; and by no means allow the pot to cease boiliag. Boil 
three-quarters of an hour. 

CHICKEN POT-PIE. No. 2. 

This style of pot-pie was made more in our grandmother's day than now, as 
most cooks consider that cooking crust so long destroys its spongey hghtness,and 
renders it too hard and dry. 

Take a pair of fine fowls; cut them up, wash the pieces, and season with 
pepper only. Make a Ught biscuit dough, and plenty of it, as it is always much 
liked by the eaters of pot-pie. EoU out the dough not very thin, and cut most 
of it into long squares. Butter the sides of a pot, and hne them with dough 
nearly to the top. Lay shoes of cold ham at the bottom of the pot, and then the 
pieces of fowl, interspersed all through with squares of dough and potatoes, 
pared and quartered. Pour in a quart of water. Cover the whole with a hd of 
dough, having a sht in the centre, through which the gravy will bubble up. 
Boil it steadily for two hom«. Half an hour before you take it up, put in 
through the hole ia the centre of the crust some bits of butter rolled in flour, to 
thicken the gravy. When done, put the pie on a large dish, and pour the gravy 
over it. 

You may intersperse it all through with cold ham, 

A pot-pie may be made of ducks, rabbits, squirrels, or venison. Also of beef- 
steak. A beef- steak, or some pork-steaks (the lean only), greatly improve a 
chicken pot-pie. If you use no ham, season with salt. 

CHICKEN STEWED, WITH BISCUIT. 

Take chickens, and make a fricassee; just before you are ready to dish it up, 
have ready two baking-tins of rich soda or baking-powder biscuits; take them 
from the oven hot, spUt them apart by breaking them with yoiu- hands, lay them 
on a large meat platter, covering it, then pour the hot chicken stew over aU. 
Send to the table hot. This is a much better way than boiling this kind of 
biscuit in the stew, as you are more sure of its being always hg-Jit. 

CHICKEN DRESSED AS TERRAPIN. 
Select young chickens, clean and cut them iato pieces; put them into a stew- 
pan with just enough water to cook them. When tender stir into it half of a 



POULTRY AND GAME. 83 

cup of butter and one beaten egg. Season it with salt and pepper, a teaspoonful 
of powdered thyme; add two hard-boiled eggs coarsely minced and a small glass 
of wine. BoU up once and serve with jelly. 

CHICKEN ROLY-POLY. 

One quart of flour, two teaspoonf uls of cream tartar mixed with the flom*, 
one teaspoonful of soda dissolved in a teacupful of milk; a teaspoonful of salt; 
do not use shortening of any kind, but roU out the mixture half an inch thick, 
and on it lay minced chicken, veal or mutton. The meat must be seasoned with 
pepper and salt, and be free from gristle. RoU the crust over and over, and put 
it on a buttered plate and place in a steamer for half an hour. Serve for break- 
fast or limch, giving a shce to each person with gravy served with it. 

CHICKEN TURNOVERS. 

Chop cold roast chicken very fine. Put it into a sauce-pan, place it over the 
fire, moisten it with a Uttle water and gravy, or a piece of butter. Season with 
salt and pepper; add a small tablespoonful of sifted flour, dissolved in a little 
water; heat all through, and remove from the fire to become cool. When cooled 
roU out some plain pie-crust quite thin, cut out in rounds as large as a saucer; 
wet the edge with cold water, and put a large spoonful of the minced meat on 
one-haJf of the rovmd; fold the other half over, and pinch the edges well together, 
then fry them in hot drippings or fat, a nice brown. They may also be cooked 
in a moderate oven. 

CHICKEN PUDDING. 

Cut up two young chickens into good- sized pieces; put them in a sauce- pan 
with just enough water to cover them well. When boiled quite tender, season 
with salt and pepper; let them simmer ten or fifteen minutes longer; then take 
the chicken from the broth and remove aU the large bones. Place the meat in 
a weU-buttered pudding-dish, season again, if necessary, adding a few bits of 
butter. Pour over this the following batter: 

Eight eggs beaten Ught and mixed with one quart of milk, three tablespoon- 
fuls of melted butter, a teaspoonful of salt, and two large teaspoonfuls of baking 
powder, added to enough sifted flour to make a batter like griddle-cakes. 

Bake one hour in a moderate, oven. 

Make a gravy of the broth that remained from the cooking of the chicken, 
adding a tablespoonful of flour, stirred into a third of a cup of melted butter; let 
it boil up, putting in more water, if necessary. Serve hot in a gravy boat, with 
the pudding. 



^4 POULTRY AND GAME. 

CHICKEN AND MACCARONI. 

Boil a chicken until very tender, take out all the bones, and pick up the meat 
quite fine. Boil half a pound of maccaroni until tender, first breaking it up to 
pieces an inch long. Butter a deep pudding-dish, put on the bottom a layer of 
the cooked maccaroni, then a layer of the minced chicken, bits of butter, pepper 
and salt, then some of the chicken Uquor, over this put another layer of macca- 
roni, and so on, until the dish is fiUed. Pour a cup of cream over the whole, 
and bake half an hour. Serve on a platter. 

ROAST DUCK. (Tame.) 

Pick, draw, clean thoroughly, and wipe dry. Cut the neck close to the back, 
beat the breast-bone flat with a roUing-pin, tie the wings and legs securely, and 
stuff with the following: 

Three pints bread-crumbs, six ounces butter, or part butter and salt pork, 
two chopped onions and one teaspoonful each of sage, black pepper and salt. 
Do not stuff very full, and sew up the openings firmly to keep the flavor in and 
the fat out. If not fat enough, it should be larded with salt pork, or tie a slice 
upon the breast. Place in a baking-pan, with a httle water, and baste frequently 
with salt and water — some add onion, and some vinegar; turn often, so that the 
sides and back may aU be nicely browned. When nearly done, baste with 
butter and a httle flour. These directions will apply to tame geese as well as 
ducks. Young ducks should roast from twenty-flve to thirty minutes, and full- 
grown ones for an hour or more, with frequent basting. Some prefer them 
underdone and served very hot; but, as a rule, thorough cooking wUl prove more 
palatable. Make a gravy out of the neck and gizzards by putting them in a 
quart of cold water, that must be reduced to a pint by boiling. The giblets, 
when done, may be chopped fine and added to the juice. The preferred season- 
ings are one table-spoonful of Madeira or sherry, a blade of mace, one small 
onion, and a httle cayenne pepper; strain through a hair sieve; pour a httle over 
the ducks and serve the remainder in a boat. Served with jellies or any tart 
sauce. 

BRAISED DUCKS. 

Prepare a pair of fine young ducks, the same as for roasting, place them in a 
stew-pan together with two or three shoes of bacon, a carrot, an onion stuck 
with two cloves, and a httle thyme and parsley. Season with pepper, and cover 
the whole with a broth, adding to the broth a giU of white wine. Place the pan 



POULTRY AND GAME. 85 

over a gentle fire and aUow the ducks to simmer vmtil done, basting them fre- 
quently. . When done remove them from the pan, and place them where they 
wiU keep hot. A tmuip should then be cut up and fried in some butter. When 
nicely browned, drain the pieces and cook them until tender in the hquor in 
which the ducks were braised. Now strain and thicken the gravy, and after 
dishing up the ducks, pour it over them, garnishing with the pieces of turnip. 

— Palmer House, Chicago. 

STEWED DUCK. 

Prepare them by cutting them up the same as chicken for fricassee. Lay 
two or three very thin shces of salt pork upon the bottom of a stew-pan; lay the 
pieces of duck upon the pork. Let them stew slowly for an hour, closely cov- 
ered. Then season with salt and pepper, half a teaspoonful of powdered sage, 
or some green sage minced fine; one chopped onion. Stew another half hour 
until the duck is tender. Stir up a large tablespoonf ul of brown flour in a Httle 
water and add it to the stew. Let it boil up, and serve aU together in one dish, 

accompanied with green peas. 

— Palmer House, Chicago. 

DUCK PIE. 

Cut all the meat from cold roast ducks; put the bones and stuffing into cold 
water; cover them and let boil; put the meat into a deep dish; pour on enough of 
the stock made from the bones to moisten; cover with pastry sht in the centre 
with a knife, and bake a light brown. 

WARMED UP DUCK. 

A nice dish for breakfast, and very rehshiag, can be made from the remains 
of a roast of duck. Cut the meat from the bones, pick out aU the Httle tidbits 
in the recesses, lay them in a frying-pan, and cover with water and the cold 
gravy left from the roast; add a piece of butter; let aU boU up once and if not 
quite thick enough, stir in a Uttle dissolved flour. Serve hot. 

ROAST WILD DUCK. 

Wild duck shoiid not be dressed too soon after being killed. If the weather 
is cold it wiU be better for being kept several days. Bake in a hot oven, letting 
it remain for five or ten minutes without basting to keep in the gravy, then 
baste frequently with butter and water. If over-done it loses flavor, 30 to 40 
minutes in the right kind of an oven being sufficient. Serve on a very hot dish, 
and send to table as hot as possible with a cut lemon and the following sauce: 



86 POVLTRY AND GAME. 

Put in a tiny sauce-pan a tablespoonful each of Worcestershire sauce and 

mushroom catsup, a little salt and cayenne pepper, and the juice of half a 

lemon. Mix well, make it hot, remove from the fire, and stir in a teaspoonfui 

of made mustard. Pour into a hot gravy boat. 

— California Style, Lick House. 

WILD DUCKS. 

Most wild ducks are apt to have the flavor of fish, and when in the hands of 
inexperienced cooks are sometimes unpalatable on this account. Before roasting 
them, parboil them with a small peeled carrot put within each duck. This 
absorbs the unpleasant taste. An onion will have the same effect, but unless you 
use onions in the stuffing, the carrot is preferable. Eoast the same as tame 
duck. Or put into the duck a whole onion peeled, plenty of salt and pepper and 
a glass of claret, bake in a hot oven 20 minutes. Serve hot with the gravy it 
yields in cooking and a dish of currant jelly. 

CANVAS-BACK DUCK. 

The epicurean taste declares that this special ktud of bird requires no spices 

or flavors to make it perfect, as the meat partakes of the flavor of the food 

that the bird feeds upon, being mostly wild celery; and the dehcious flavor is 

best preserved when roasted quickly with a hot fire. After dressing the duck 

in the usual way, by plucking, singing, drawing, wipe it with a wet towel, truss 

the head under the wing; place it in a dripping-pan, put it in the oven, basting 

often, and roast it half an hour. It is generally preferred a httle underdone. 

Place it when done on a hot dish, season well with salt and pepper, pour over it 

the gravy it has yielded in baking and serve it imrnediately while hot. 

— Delmonico. 

ROAST PIGEONS. 

Pigeons lose their flavor by being kept more than a day after they are killed. 
They may be prepared and roasted or broiled the same as chickens; they will 
require from twenty to thirty minutes cooking. Make a gravy of the giblets or 
not, season it with pepper and salt, and add a httle flour and butter. 

STEWED PIGEONS. 

Clean and stuff with onion dressing, thyme, etc., — do not sew up; take five 
or more sliees of corned pork, let it fry a while in a pot so that the fat comes out 
and it begins to brown a httle; then lay the pigeons all around in the fat, leaving 
the pork still in; add hot water enough to partially cover them; cover tightly 
and boil an hour or so until tender; then turn off some of the hquid, and keep 



POULTRY AND GAME. 5; 

turning them so they will brown nicely; then heat and add the hquor poured 
ofif ; add extra thyme, pepper, and keep turning until the pigeons and gravy are 
nicely browned. Thicken with a Uttle flour, and serve with the gravy poured 
over them; garnish with parsley. 

PIGEON PIE. 

Take half a dozen pigeons; stuff each one with a dressing the same as for 
turkey; loosen the joints vsdth a knife, but do not separate them. Put them in 
a stew-pan with water enough to cover them, let them cook until nearly tender, 
then season them with salt and pepper and butter. Thicken the gravy with 
flour, remove and cool. Butter a pudding -dish, line the sides with a rich crust. 
Have ready some hard-boiled eggs cut in sUces. Put in a layer of egg and birds 
and gravy until the dish is full. Cover with a crust and bake. 

BROILED PIGEONS OR SQUABS. 

Split them down the back and broil the same ais chicken; seasoning well with 
salt, pepper and plenty of butter. Broil shces of salt pork, very thin; place a 
slice over each bird and serve. 

SQUAB POT-PIE. 

Cut into dice three ounces of salt pork; divide six wild squabs into pieces, at 
the joints; remove the sldn. Cut up four potatoes into small squares, and pre- 
pare a dozen small dough balls. 

Put into a yellow, deep baMng-dish the pork, potatoes and squabs, and then 

the balls of dough; season vsdth salt, white pepper, a dash of mace or nutmeg; 

add hot water enough to cover the ingredients, cover with a " short " pie-crust 

and bake in a moderate oven three-quarters of an hour. 

— Palmer House, Chicago. 

WOODCOCK, ROASTED. 

Skin the head and neck of the bird, pluck the feathers, and truss it by bring- 
ing the beak of the bird imder the wing, and fastening the pinion to the thigh; 
twist the legs at the knuckles and press the feet upon the thigh. Put a piece of 
bread under each bird to catch the drippings, baste with butter, dredge with 
flour, and roast fifteen or twenty minutes with a sharp fire. When done, cut 
the bread in diamond shape, each piece large enough to stand one bird upon, 
place them aslant an. your dish, and serve with gravy enough to moisten the 
bread; serve some in die dish and some in the tureen; garnish wdth shces of 
lemon. Eoast from twenty to twenty-five minutes. 



88 POULTRY AND GAME, 

SNIPE. 
Snipe are similar to woodcock, and may be served in the same manner; they 
will require less time to roast. 

REED BIRDS. 

Pick and draw them very carefully, salt and dredge with flour, and roast 
with a quick fire ten or fifteen minutes. Serve on toast with butter and pepper. 
You can put in each one an oyster dipped in butter and then in bread-crumbs 
before roasting. They are also very nice broiled. 

ROAST QUAIL. 

Rinse well and steam over boiling water until tender, then dredge with flour, 
and smother in butter; season with salt and pepper and roast inside the stove; 
thicken the gravy; serve with green grape jeUy, and garnish with parsley. 

TO ROAST PARTRIDGES, PHEASANTS, QUAILS OR GROUSE. 

Carefully cut out all the shot, wash thoroughly but quickly, using soda in the 
water; rinse again, and dry with a clean cloth. Stuff them and sew them up. 
Skewer the legs and wings to the body, larder the breast with very thin slices of 
fat salt pork, place them in the oven, and baste with butter and water before 
taking up, having seasoned them with salt and pepper; or you can leave out the 
pork and use only butter, or cook them without stuffing. Make a gravy of the 
drippings thickened with browned flour. Boil up and serve in a boat. 

These are aU very fine broiled, first splitting down the back, placing on the 
gridiron the inside down, cover with a baking tin, and broil slowly at first. 
Serve with cream gravy. 

GAME PIE. 
Clean well, inside and out, a dozen small birds, quail, snipe, woodcock, etc., 
and split them in half; put them in a sauce-pan with about two quarts of water; 
when it boils, skim off aU scum that rises; then add salt and pepper, a bunch of 
minced parsley, one onion chopped fine, and three whole cloves. Cut up half a 
pound of salt pork into dice, and let aU bofl until tender, using care that there 
be enough water to cover the birds. Thicken this with two tablespoonfuls of 
browned flour and let it boil up. Stir in a piece of butter as large as an egg; 
remove from the nre and let it cool. Have ready a pint of potatoes cut as small 
as dice, and a rich crust made. Line the sides of a buttered pudding-dish with 
the crust; lay in the birds, then some of the potatoes, then birds and so on, until 
the dish ie fiiJJ. Poiir oyer the^ravy. put nnthe top crust, with a slit cut in the

centre, and bake. The top can be ornamented with pastry leaves in a wreath 
about the edge, with any fancy design placed in the centre across the sUt. 

— Rockaway Beach. 

SNOW BIRDS. 

One dozen thoroughly cleaned birds; stuff each with an oyster, put them into 
a yeUow dish, and add two ounces of boiled salt pork and three raw potatoes cut 
into sUces; add a pint of oyster liquor, an oimce of butter; salt and pepper; cover 
the dish with a crust and bake in a moderate oven. 

SQUIRREL. 

They are cooked similar to rabbits, are excellent when broiled or made into 
a stew, and, in fact, are very good in aU the different styles of cooking similar to 
rabbit. 

There are many species common to this country; among them the black, red, 
gray and fox. Gophers and chipmunks may also be classed as another but 
smaller variety 

ROAST HARE OR RABBIT. 

A very close relationship exists between the hare and the rabbit, the chief 
difference being in the smaller size and shorter legs and ears of the latter. The 
manner of dressing and preparing each for the table is, therefore, pretty nearly 
the same. To prepare them for roasting, first skin, wash well in cold water and 
rinse thoroughly in lukewarm water. If a Uttle musty from being emptied 
before they were hung up, and afterward neglected, rub the insides with vinegar 
and afterward remove all taint of the acid by a thorough washing in lukewarm 
water. After being well wiped with a soft cloth put in a dressing as usual, sew 
the animal up, truss it, and roast for a half or three-quarters of an hour, until 
well-browned, basting it constantly with butter and dredging with flour, just 
before taking up. 

To make a gravy, after the rabbits are roasted, pour nearly aU the fat out of 
the pan, but do not pour the bottom or brown part of the drippings; put the pao 
over the fire, stir into it a heaping tablespoonful of flour, and stir imtil the flour 
browns. Then stir in a pint of boiling water. Season the gravy with salt and 
pepper; let it boil for a moment. Send hot to the table in a tureen with the hot 
rabbits. Serve with currant jelly. 

FRICASSEE RABBIT. 
Clean two young rabbits, cut into joints, and soak in salt and water half all 
hour. Put into a sauce-pan with a pint of cold water, a bunch of sweet herbs, 



90 POULTRY AND GAME. 

an onion finely minced, a pinch of mace, half a nutmeg, a pinch of pepper and 
half a pound of salt pork cut in small thin sUces. Cover and stew until tender. 
Take out the rabbits and set in a dish where they wUl keep warm. Add to the 
gravy a cup of cream (or nulk), two weU-beaten eggs, stirred in a httle at a time, 
a tablespoonf ul of butter, and a thickening made of a tablespoonf ul of flour 
and a httle mUk. Boil up once; remove the sauce-pan from the fire, squeeze in 
the juice of a lemon, stirring all the while, and pour over the rabbits. Do not 
cook the head or neck. 

FRIED RABBIT. 

After the rabbit has been thoroughly cleaned and washed, put it into boiling 
water, and let it boil ten minutes; drain it, and when cold, cut it into joints, dip 
into beaten egg, and then in fine bread-crumbs; season with salt and pepper. 
When aU are ready, fry them in butter and sweet lard, mixed over a moderate 
fire imtll brown on both sides. Take them out, thicken the gravy with a spoon- 
ful of flour, turn in a cup of mUk or cream; let aU boil up, and turn over the 
rabbits. Serve hot with onion sauce. (See Sauces.) Garnish with shced lemon. 

RABBIT PIE. 

This pie can be made the same as "Game Pie," excepting you scatter 
through it four hard-boiled eggs cut in shoes. Cover with puff paste, cut a slit 
in the middle, and bake one hour, laying paper over the top should it brown 
too fast. 

BROILED RABBITS. 

After skinning and cleaning the rabbits, wipe them dry, spht them down the 
back lengthwise, pound them flat, then wrap them in letter paper well buttered, 
place them on a buttered gridiron, and broil over a clear, brisk fire, turning them 
often. Wheu sufficiently cooked, remove the papers, lay them on a very hot 
platter, season with salt, pepper, and plenty of butter, turning them over and 
over to soak up the butter. Cover and keep hot in a warming oven untU served. 

SALMI OF GAME. 

This is a nice mode of serving the remains of roasted game, but when a 
superlative salmi is desired, the birds must be scarcely more than half roasted 
for it. In either case, carve them very neatly, and strip every particle of skin 
and fat from the legs, wings and breasts; bruise the bodies well, and put them 
with the skin and other trimmings into a very clean stew-pan. If for a simple 
and inexpensive dinner, merely add to them two sliced onions, a bay-leaf, a small 



PO UL TR Y AND GAME. 9 1 

blade of mace and a few peppercorns; then pour in a pint or more of good veal 
gravy, or strong broth, and boil it briskly until reduced nearly half; strain the 
gravy, pressing the bones well to obtain aU the flavor; skim off the fat, add a 
little cayenne and lemon juice, heat the game very gradually in it, but do not 
on any accovmt allow it to boil; place pieces of fried bread round a dish, arrange 
the birds in good form in the centre, give the sauce a boil, and pour it on them, 

ROAST HAUNCH OF VENISON. 

To prepare a haunch of venison for roasting, wash it sUghtly in tepid water, 

and dry it thoroughly by rubbing it with a clean, soft cloth. Lay over the fat 

side a large sheet of thickly buttered paper, and next a paste of flour and water 

about three-quarters of an inch thick; cover this again with two or three sheets 

of stout paper, secure the whole well with twine, and put down to roast, with a 

little water, in the dripping-pan. Let the fire be clear and strong; baste the 

paper immediately with butter or clarified drippings, and roast the joint from 

three to four hours, according to its weight and quality. Doe venison will 

require half an hour less time than buck venison. About twenty minutes before 

the joint is done remove the paste and paper, baste the meat in every part with 

butter, and dredge it very lightly with flour; let it take a pale brown color, and 

serve hot with unflavored gravy made with a thickening, in a tureen and good 

currant jelly. Venison is much better when the deer has been killed in the 

autumn, when wild berries are plentiful, and it has had abundant opportunities 

to fatten upon this and other fresh food. 

— Windsor Hotel, Montreal. 

BROILED VENISON STEAK. 

Venison steaks should be broiled over a clear fire, turning often. It requires 
more cooking than beef. When sufficiently done, season with salt and pepper, 
pom- over two tablespoonfuls of currant jelly, melted with a piece of butter. 
Serve hot on hot plates. 

Delicious steaks, corresponding to the shape of mutton chops, are cut from 
ttie loin. 

BAKED SADDLE OF VENISON. 

Wash the saddle carefully; see that no hairs are left dried on to the outside. 
Use a saddle of venison of about ten poimds. Out some salt pork in strips about 
two inches long, and an eighth of an inch thick, with which lard the saddle 
with two rows on each side. In a large dripping-pan cut two carrots, one onion, 
and some salt pork in thin slices; add two bay leaves, two cloves, four kernels 



92 POULTRY AND GAME. 

of allspice, half a lemon, sliced, and season with salt and pepper; place the saddle 
of venison in the pan, with a quart of good stock, boiling hot, and a small piece 
©f butter, and let it boU about fifteen minutes on top of the stove; then put it in 
a hot oven and bake, basting weU every five minutes, until it is medimn rare, so 
that the blood runs when cut; serve with jeUy or a wine sauce. If the venison 
is desired well done, cook much longer, and use a cream sauce with it, or stir 
cream into the venison gravy. (For cream sauce see Sauces.) 

Venison should never be roasted unless very fat. The shoulder is a roasting 
piece, and may be done without the paper or paste. 

In ordering the saddle request the butcher to cut the ribs off pretty close, as 
the only part that is of much account is the tenderloin and thick meat that hes 
along the backbone up to the neck. The ribs which extend from this have very 
httle meat on them, but are always sold with the saddle. When neatly cut off 
they leave the saddle in » >>Atter shape, and the ribs can be put into your stock- 
pot to boil for soup. 

— Windsor Hotel, Montreal. 

VENISON PIE OR PASTRY. 

The neck, breast and shoulder are the parts used for a venison pie or pastry. 
Cut the meat into pieces (fat and lean together) and put the bones and trim- 
mings into the stew-pan with pepper and salt, and water or veal broth enough 
to cover it. Simmer it tUl you have drawn out a good gravy. Then strain it. 

In the meantime make a good rich paste, and roll it rather thick. Cover the 
bottom and sides of a deep dish with one sheet of it, and put in your meat, 
having seasoned it with pepper, salt, nutmeg and mace. Pour in the gravy 
which you have prepared from the trimmings, and a glass of port wine. Lay 
on the top some bits of butter rolled in flour. Cover the pie with a thick hd of 
paste and ornament it handsomely with leaves and flowers formed with a tin 
cutter. Bake two or more hours according to the size. Just before it is done, 
pull it forward in the oven, and brush it over with beaten egg; push it back and 

let it shghtly brown.

VENISON HASHED. 

Cut the meat in nice small shces, and put the trimmings and bones into a 
sauce-pan with barely water enough to cover them. Let them stew for an hour. 
Then strain the hqmd into a stew-pan; add to it some bits of butter, rolled in 
flour, and whatever gravy was left of the venison the day before. Stir in some 
currant jeUy, and give it a boil up. Then put in the meat, and keep it over the 



PO UL TR Y AND GAME. 93 

fixe just long enough to warm it through; but do not allow it to boU, as it has 
been once cooked already. 

FRIED VENISON STEAK. 

Cut a breast of venison into steaks; make a quarter of a poimd of butter hot 
in a pan; rub the steaks over with a mixture of a httle salt and pepper; dip them 
in wheat flour, or rolled crackers, and fry a rich brown; when both sides are 
done, take them up on a dish, and put a tin cover over; dredge a heaping tea- 
spoonful of flour into the butter in the pan, stir it with a spoon until it is brown, 
without burning; put to it a small teacupful of boiling water, with a tablespoon- 
ful of currant jelly dissolved into it; stir it for a few minutes, then strain it over 
the meat, and serve. A glass of wine, with atablespoonful of white sugar dis- 
solved in it, may be used for the gravy, instead of the jeUy and water. Venison 
may be boiled, and served with boiled vegetables, pickled beets, etc., and sauce. 



In the selection of meat it is most essential that we understand how to choose 
it; in beef it shotild be a smooth, fine grain, of a clear bright red color, the fat 
white, and will feel tender when pinched with the fingers. WiU also have 
abundant kidney fat or suet. The most choice pieces for roast are the sirloin, 
fore and middle ribs. 

Veal, to be good, should have the fiesh firm and dry, fine grained and of a 
dehcate pinldsh color, and plenty of kidney fat; the joints stiff. 

Mutton is good when the flesh is a bright red, firm and juicy and a close 
grain, the fat firm and white. 

Pork: if young, the lean will break on being pinched smooth when nipped 
with the fingers, also the skin will break and dent; if the rind is rough and hard 
it is old. 

In roasting meat, allow from fifteen to twenty minutes to the pound, which 
will vary according to the thickness of the roast. A great deal of the success in 
roasting depends on the heat and goodness of the fire; if put into a cool oven it 
loses its juices, and the result is a tough, tasteless roast; whereas, if the oven is 
of the proper heat, it immediately sears up the pores of the meat and the juices 
are retained. 

The oven should be the hottest when the meat is put into it, in order to 
quickly crisp the surface and close the pores of the meat, thereby confining its 
^mtural juices. If the oven is too hot to hold the hand in for only a moment, 
then the oven is right to receive the meat. The roast should first be washed in 
pure water, then wiped dry with a clean dry cloth, placed in a baking-pan, 
without any seasoning; some pieces of suet or cold drippings laid under it, but 
no water should be put into the pan, for this would have a tendency to soften the 
outside of the meat. The water can never get so hot as the hot fat upon the 
sinface of the meat, and the generating of the steam prevents its crispness, so 
desirable in a roast. 



MEATS. 95 

It should be frequently basted with its own drippings which flow from the meat 
when partly cooked and well seasoned. Lamb, veal and pork shovild be cooked 
rather slower than beef, with a more moderate fire, covering the fat with a piece 
of paper, and thoroughly cooked till the flesh parto fvom the bone; and nicely 
browned, without being burned. An onion sliced aud put on top of a roast 
while cooking, especially roast of pork, gives a nice tf^vor. Eemove the onion 
before serving. 

Larding meats is drawing ribbons of fat pork through the upper surface of 
the meat, leaving both ends protruding. This is accomplished by the use of a 
larding -needle, which may be procured at house-furnishing stores. 

Boihng or stewing meat, if fresh, should be put into boiling water, closely 
covered, and boiled slowly, allowing twenty minutes to each pound, and when 
partly cooked, or when it begins to get tender, salted,adding spices and vegetables. 

Salt meats should be covered with cold water, and require thirty minutes very 
slow boiling, from the time the water boils, for each pound; if it is very salt, 
pour off the first water, and put it in another of boiling water, or it may be 
soaked one night in cold water. After meat commences to boil, the pot shoijld 
never stop simmering and always be replenished from the boiling tea-kettle. 

Frying may be done in two ways: one method, which is most generally used, 
is by putting one otmce or more (as the case requires) of beef drippings, lard or 
butter, into a frying-pan, and when at the boiling point, laying in the meat, 
cooking both sides a nice brown. The other method is to completely immerse 
the article to be cooked in sufficient hot lard to cover it, similar to frying 
doughnuts. 

BroUed meats should be placed over clear, red coals, free from smoke, giving 
out a good heat, but not too brisk or the meat will be hardened and scorched; 
but if the fire is dead, the gravy will escape, and drop upon the coals, creating a 
blaze, which will blacken and smoke the meat. Steaks and chops should be 
turned often, in order that every part should be evenly done — never sticking a 
fork into the lean part, as that lets the juices escape; it should be put into the 
outer skin or fat. When the meat is sufficiently broiled, it should be laid on a hot 
dish and seasoned. The best pieces for steak are the porter-house, sirloin, and 
rump. 

THAWING FROZEN MEAT, Etc. 

If meat, poultry, fish, vegetables, or any other article of food, when found 
frozen, is thawed by putting it into warm water or placing it before the fire, it 
win most certainly spoil by that process, and be rendered unfit to eat. The only 



9^ MEATS. 

way to thaw these things is by immersing them in cold water. This should be 
done as soon as they are brought in from market, that they may have time to 
be well thawed before they are co-^ked. If meat that has been frozen is to be 
boiled, put it on in cold water. If to be roasted, begin by setting it at a distance 
from the fire; for if it should not chance to be thoroughly thawed aU through to 
the centre, placing it at fitrst too near the fire will cause it to spoil. If it is 
expedient to thaw the meat or poultry the night before cooking, lay it in cold 
water early in the evening, and change the water at bed-time. If found crusted 
with ice in the morning, remove the ice, and put the meat in fresh cold water, 
letting it he in it till wanted for cooking. 

Potatoes are injured by being frozen. Other vegetables are not the worse for 
it, provided they are always thawed in cold water, 

TO KEEP MEAT FROM FLIES. 

Put in sacks, with enough straw around it so the flies cannot reach through. 

Three-fourths of a yard of yard-wide musUn is the right size for the sack. Put 

a little straw in the bottom, then put in the ham and lay straw in all around it; 

tie it tightly, and hang it in a cool, dry place. Be sure the straw is aU around the 

meat, so the flies cannot reach through to deposit the eggs. (The sacking must 

be done early in the season before the fly appears.) Mushn lets the air in and is 

much better than paper. Thin muslin is as good as thick, and will last for years 

if washed when laid away when emptied.

ROAST BEEF. 

One very essential point in roasting beef is to have the oven well heated 
when the beef is first put in; this causes the pores to close up quickly, and pre- 
vents the escape of the juices. 

Take a rib piece or loin roast of seven or eight pounds. Wipe it thoroughly 
all over with a clean wet towel. Lay it in a dripping-pan, and baste it well with 
butter or suet fat. Set it in the oven. Baste it frequently with its own drip- 
pings, which win make it brown and tender. When partly done, season with 
salt and pepper, as it hardens any meat to salt it when raw, and draws out its 
juices, then dredge with sifted flour to give it a frothy appearance. It will take 
a roast of this size about two hoiu's time to be properly done, leaving the inside 
a little rare or red — half an hour less would make the inside quite rare. Remove 
the beef to a heated dish, set where it will keep hot; then skim the drippings 
from all fat, add a tablespoonful of sifted flour, a Uttle pepper and a teacupful 
of boj'ing water. Boil up once and serve hot in a gravy boat. 



MEATS. 97 

Some prefer the clear gravy without the thickening. Serve with mustard ot 
grated horse-radish and vinegar. 

YORKSHIRE PUDDING. 

This is a very nice accompaniment to a roast of beef; the ingredients are, one 
pint of milk, four eggs, white and yolks beaten separately, one teaspoonful 
of salt, and two teaspoonfuls of baMng powder sifted through two cups of 
flour. It should be mixed very smooth, about the consistency of cream. Eegu- 
late your time when you put in your roast, so that it will be done half an hour 
or forty miuutes before dishing up. Take it from the oven, set it where it will 
keep hot. In the meantime have this pudding prepared. Take two common 
biscuit tios, dip some of the drippings from the dripping-pan into these tins, poiir 
half of the pudding into each, set them into the hot oven, and keep them in until 
the dinner is dished up; take these puddings out at the last moment and send to 
the table hot. This I consider much better than the old way of baking the 
pudding under the meat 

BEEFSTEAK. No. i. 

The first consideration in broiling is to have a clear, glowing bed of coals. 
The steak should be about three-quarters of an inch in thickness, and should be 
pounded only in extreme cases, i.e., when it is cut too thick and is " stringy. ' ' Lay 
it on a buttered gridiron, turning it often, as it begins to drip, attempting nothing 
else while cooking it. Have everything else ready for the table; the potatoes 
and vegetables dished and in the warming closet. Do not season it until it is 
done, which will be in about ten to twelve minutes. Eemove it to a warm 
platter, pepper and salt it on both sides and spread a hberal lump of butter over 
it. Serve at once whQe hot. No definite rule can be given as to the time, of 
cooking steak, individual tastes differ so widely in regard to it, some only liking 
it when well done, others so rare that the blood runs out of it. The best pieces 
for broiling are the porter-house and sirloin. 

BEEFSTEAK. No. 2. 

Take a smooth, thick-bottomed frying-pan, scald it out with hot water, and 
wipe it dry; set it on the stove or range, and when very hot, rub it over the 
bottom with a rag dipped in butter; then place your steak or chops in it, turn 
often until cooked through, take up on a warm platter, and season both sides 
with salt, pepper and butter. Serve hot. 

Many prefer this manner of cooking steak rather than broUing or frying in 
a quantity of grease.

BEEFSTEAK AND ONIONS. 
Prepare the steak in the usual way. Have ready in a frying pan a dozen 
onions cut in sUces and fried brown in a little beef drippings or butter. Dish 
your steak, and lay the onions thickly over the top. Cover and let stand five 
minutes, then send to the table hot. 

* 

BEEFSTEAK AND OYSTERS. 

BroU the steak the usual way. Put one quart of oysters with very httle of 

the liquor into a stew-pan upon the fire; when it comes to a boil, take off the 

scum that may rise, stir in three ounces of butter mixed with a tablespoonf ul 

of sifted fiour, let it boU one miuute until it thickens, pour it over the steak. 

Serve hot.

TO FRY BEEFSTEAKS. 

Beefsteak for frying should be cut much thinner than for broihng. Take 
from the ribs or sirloin and remove the bone. Put some butter or nice beef dripping 
into a frying-pan, and set it over the fire, and when it has boiled and become hot, 
lay in the steaks; when cooked quite enough, season with salt and pepper, turn 
and brown on both sides. Steaks when fried should be thoroughly done. Have 
ready a hot dish, and when they are done, take out the steaks and lay them on 
it, with another dish cover the top to keep them hot. The gravy in the pan can 
be turned over the steaks, first adding a few drops of boOing water, or a gravy 
to be served in a separate dish made by putting a large tablespoonful of flour 
into the hot gravy left in the pan, after taking up the steaks. Stir it smooth, 
then pour in a pint of cream or sweet rich milk, salt and pepper, let it boil up 
once until it thickens, pour hot into a gravy dish, and send to the table with the 
steaks. 

POT ROAST. (Old Style.) 

This is an old-fashioned dish, often cooked in our grandmothers' time. Take 
a piece of fresh beef weighing about five or six pounds. It must not be too fat. 
Wash it and put it into a pot with barely sufiicient water to cover it. Set it 
over a slow fire, and after it has stewed an hour salt and pepper it Then stew 
it slowly until tender, adding a httle onion if hked. Do not replenish the water 
at the last, but let aU nearly boil away. When tender all through take the 
meat from the pot, and pour the gravy in a bowl. Put a large lump of butter 
jn the bottom of the pot, then dredge the piece of meat with flour, and return it 




tf»«. 



MEA TS. 99 

to the pot to brown, turning it often to prevent its burning. Take the gravy 
that you have poured from the meat into the bowl, and skim off all the fat; pour 
this gravy ia with the meat and stir in a large spoonful of flour; wet with a httle 
water; let it boil up ten or fifteen minutes and pour into a gravy dish. Serve 
both hot, the meat on a platter. Some are very fond of this way of cooking a 
piece of beef which has been previously placed in spiced pickle for two or three 
days. 

SPICED BEEF. (Excellent.) 

For a round of beef weighing twenty or twenty-four pounds, take one quarter 
of a pound of saltpetre, one quarter of a pound of coarse brown sugar, two 
pounds of salt, one ounce of cloves, one ounce of allspice, and half an ounce of 
mace; pulverize these materials, mix them well together, and with them rub 
the beef thoroughly on every part; let the beef he for eight or ten days in the 
pickle thus made, turning and rubbing it every day; then tie it around with a 
broad tape, to keep it in shape; make a coarse paste ^f flour and water, lay a 
Uttle suet finely chopped over and under the beef, inclose the beef entirely in 
the paste, and bake it six hours. When you take the beef from the oven, 
remove the paste, but do not remove the tape tmtfl you are ready to send it to 
the table. If you wish to eat the beef cold, keep it well covered that it may 
retain its moisture. 

BEEF A LA MODE. 

Mix together three teaspoonfuls of salt, one of pepper, one of ginger, one of 
mace, one of cinnamon, and two of cloves. Eub this mixtui-e into ten pounds 
of the upper part of a round of beef. Let this beef stand in this state over night. 
In the morning, make a dressing or stuffing of a pint of fine bread-cnunbs, half 
a pound of fat salt pork cut in dice, a teaspoonful of ground thyme or summer 
savory, two teaspoonfuls sage, half a teaspoonful of pepper, one of nutmeg, a 
;'Uttle cloves, an onion minced fine, moisten with a httle milk or water. Stuff 
this mixture into the place from whence you took out the bone. With a long 
skewer fasten the two ends of the beef together, so that its form wiU be circular, 
and bind it around with tape, to prevent the skewers giving away. Make 
incisions in the beef with a sharp knife; fill these incisions very closely with the 
stuffing, and dredge the whole with flour. 

Put it into a dripping-pan and pour over it a pint of hot water; turn a large 
pan over it to keep in the steam, and roast slowly from three to four hours, 
allowing a quarter of an hour to each pound of meat. If the meat should be 



lOO MEATS. 

tough, it may be stewed first in a pot with water enough to cover it, until tender, 
and then put into a dripping-pan and browned in the oven. 

If the meat is to be eaten hot, skim off the fat from the gravy, into which, 
after it is taken off the fire, stir in the beaten yolks of two eggs. If onions are 
disUked you may omit them and substitute minced oysters. 

TENDERLOIN OF BEEF. 

To serve tenderloin as directed below, the whole piece must be extracted 
before the hind quarter of the animal is cut out. This must be particularly 
noted, because not commonly practised, the tenderloin being usually left attached 
to the roasting pieces, in order to furnish a tidbit for a few. To dress it whole, 
proceed as foUows: Washing the piece well, put it in an oven; add about a pint 
of water, and chop up a good handful of each of the following vegetables as an 
ingredient of the dish, viz., Irish potatoes, carrots, turnips, and a large bunch 
of celery. They must be washed, peeled, and chopped up raw, then added to 
the meat; blended with the juice, they form and flavor the gravy. Let the 
whole slowly simmer, and when nearly done, add a teaspoonful of pounded 
allspice. To give a richness to the gravy, put in a tablespoonful of butter. If 
the gravy should look too greasy, skim off some of the melted suet. Boil also a 
lean piece of beef, which, when perfectly done, chop fine, flavoring with a very 
smaU quantity of onion, besides pepper and salt to the taste. Make into small 
balls, wet them on the outside with eggs, roll in grated cracker or fine bread- 
crumbs. Fry these force-meat balls a hght brown. When serving the dish, put 
these aroimd the tenderloin, and pour over the whole the rich gravy. This dish 
is a very handsome one, and, altogether, fit for an epicurean palate. A sumptu- 
ous dish. 

STEWED STEAK WITH OYSTERS. 

Two pounds of rump steak, one pint of oysters, one tablespoonful of lemon 
juice, three of butter, one of flour, salt, pepper, one cupful of water. Wash the 
oysters in the water, and drain into a stew-pan. Put this liquor on to heat. As 
soon as it comes to a boil, skim and set back. Put the butter in a frying-pan, 
and when hot, put in a steak. Cook ten minutes. Take up the steak, and stir 
the flour into the butter remaining in the pan. Stir im^til a dark brown. Add 
the oyster liquor, and boil one minute. Season with salt and pepper. Put back 
the steak, cover the pan, and simmer half an hour or until the steak seems 
tender, then add the oysters and lemon juice. Boil one minute. Serve on a hot 
dish with points of toast for a garnish.

SMOTHERED BEEFSTEAK. 

Take thin slices of steak from the upper part of the round or one large thin 
steak. Lay the meat out smoothly and wipe it dry. Prepare a dressing, using a 
cupful of fine bread-crumbs, half a teaspoonful of salt, some pepper, a table 
spoonful of butter, half a teaspoonful of sage, the same of powdered summer 
savory, and enough milk to moisten it all into a stiff mixture. Spread it over 
the meat, roU it up carefully, and tie with a string, securing the ends well. 
Now fry a few thin sUces of salt pork ia the bottom of a kettle or sauce-pan, 
and into the fat that has fried out of this pork, place this roll or rolls of beef, 
and brown it on all sides, turning it until a rich color all over, then add half a 
pint of water, and stew until tender. If the flavor of onion is liked, a shce may 
be chopped fine and added to the dressing. When cooked sufficiently, take out 
the meat, thicken the gravy, and turn over it. To be carved cutting crosswise, 
in slices, through beef and stuffing. 

BEEFSTEAK ROLLS. 

This mode is similar to the above recipe, but many might prefer it: 
Prepare a good dressing, such as you like for turkey or duck; take a round 
steak, pound it, but not very hard, spread the dressing over it, sprinkle in a httle 
salt, pepper, and a few bits of butter, lap over the ends, roll the steak up tightly 
and tie closely; spread two great spoonfuls of butter over the steak after rolling 
it up, then wash with a well-beaten egg, put water in the bake-pan, lay in the 
steak so as not to touch the water, and bake as you would a duck, basting often, 
A half hour in a brisk oven will bake. Make a brown gravy, and send to the 
table hot. 

TO COLLAR A FLANK OF BEEF. 

Procure a well-corned flank of beef, — say six poimds. Wash it, and remove 
the inner and outer skin with the gristle. Prepare a seasoning of one teaspoon- 
ful each of sage, parsley, thyme, pepper and cloves. Lay your meat upon a 
board and spread this mixture over the inside. Eoll the beef up tight, fasten it 
with small skewers, put a cloth over it, bandage the cloth with tape, put the 
beef into the stew-pot, cover it with water to the depth of an inch, boil gently 
six hours; take it out of the water, place it on a board without undoing it; lay a 
board on top of the beef, put a fifty pound weight upon this board, and let it 
remain twenty-four hours. Take off the bandage, garnish with green pickles 
and curled parsley, and serve.

DRIED BEEF. 



Buy the best of beef, or that part which will be the most lean and tender. 
The tender part of the round is a very good piece. For every twenty pounds of 
beef use one pint of salt, one teaspoonf ul of saltpetre, and a quarter of a pound 
of brown sugar. Mix them well together, and rub the beef weU with one-third 
of the mixture for three successive days. Let it lie ia the liquor it makes for 
six days, then hang up to dry. 

A large crock or jar is a good vessel to prepare the meat in before drying it. 

BEEF CORNED OR SALTED. (Red.) 

Out up a quarter of beef. For each hundred weight take half a peck of 
coarse salt, a quarter of a pound of saltpetre, the same weight of saleratus, and 
a quart of molasses, or two pounds of coarse brown sugar. Mace, cloves and 
allspice, may be added for spiced beef. 

Strew some of the salt in the bottom of a pickle-tub or barrel; then put in a 
layer of meat, strew this with salt, then add another layer of meat, and salt and 
meat alternately, untU all is used. Let it remain one night. Dissolve the 
saleratus and saltpetre in a Uttle warm water, and put it to the molasses or 
sugar; then put it over the meat, add water enough to cover the meat, lay a 
board on it to keep it under the brine. The meat is fit for use after ten days. 
This receipt is for winter beef. Eather more salt may be used in warm weather. 

Towards spring take the brine from the meat, make it boiling hot, skim it 
clear, and when it is cooled, return it to the meat. 

Beef tongues and smoking pieces are fine pickled in this brine. Beef Uver 
put in this brine for ten days, and then wiped dry and smoked, is very fine. Cut 
it in shces, and fry or broil it. The brisket of beef, after being corned, may be 
smoked, and is very good for boiling. 

Lean pieces of beef, cut properly from the hind quarter, are the proper pieces 
for being smoked. There may be some fine pieces cut from the fore-quarter. 

After the beef has been in brine ten days or more, wipe it dry, and hang it in 
a chimney where wood is burned, or make a smothered fire of sawdust or chips, 
and keep it smoking for ten days; then rub fine black pepper over every part to 
keep the flies from it, and hang it in a dry, dark, cool place. After a week it is 
fit for use. A strong, coarse brown paper, folded around the beef, and fastened 
with paste, keeps it nicely. 

Tongues are smoked in the same manner. Hang them by a string put

through the root end. Spiced brine for smoked beef or tongues will be gener- 
ally hked. 

ROAST BEEF PIE WITH POTATO CRUST. 

When you have a cold roast of beef, cut off as much as -will half fill a baking- 
-iish smted to the size of your family; put this sUced beef into a stew-pan with 
any gravy that you may have also saved, a lump of butter, a bit of sUced onion, 
and a seasoning of pepper and salt, with enough water to make plenty of gra^y; 
thicken it, too, by dredging in a tablespoonful of flour; cover it up on the fire, 
where it may stew gently, but not be in danger of burning. Meanwhile there 
must be boiled a sufficient quantity of potatoes to fill up your baking-dish, after 
the stewed meat has been transferred to it. The potatoes must be boiled done, 
mashed smooth, and beaten up with milk and butter, as if they were to be 
served alone, and placed in a thick layer on top of the meat. Brush it over with 
egg, place the dish in an oven, and let it remain there long enough to be brown. 
There should be a goodly quantity of gravy left with the beef, that the dish be 
not dry and tasteless. Serve with it tomato sauce, Worcestershire sauce or any 
other kind that you prefer. A good, plain dish. 

ROAST BEEF PIE. 

Cut up roast beef, or beef steak left from a previous meal, into thin shces, 
lay some of the slices into a deep dish which you have Uned on the sides with 
rich biscuit dough, rolled very thin, fsay a quarter of an inch thick); now 
sprinkle over this layer a little pepper and salt; put in a small bit of butter, a 
few shces of cold potatoes, a Uttle of the cold gravy, if you have any left from 
the roast. Make another layer of beef, another layer of seasoning, and so on, 
until the dish is filled; cover the whole with paste, leaving a sht in the centre, 
and bake half an hour. 

BEEF STEAK PIE. 

Cut up rump or flank steak into strips two inches long and about an inch 
wide. Stew them with the bone in just enough water to cover them until partly 
cooked; have half a dozen of cold boiled potatoes sUced. Line a baking-dish 
with pie paste, put in a layer of the meat with salt, pepper, and a httle of thinly 
sliced onion, then one of the sliced potatoes, with bits of butter dotted over 
them. Then the steak, alternated with layers of potato, until the dish is full. 
Add the gravy or broth, having first thickened it with brown flour. Cover 
with a top crust, making a sKt in tbe middle; brush a Uttle beaten egg over it, 
and bake until quite brown.

FRIZZLED BEEF. 

Shave ofiE very thin slices of smoked or dried beef, put them in a frying-pan, 
cover with cold water, set it on the back of the range or stove, and let it come 
to a very slow heat, allowing it time to swell out to its natural size, but not to 
boil. Stir it up, then drain off the water. Melt one ounce of sweet butter m 
the frying-pan, and add the wafers of beef. When they begin to frizzle or turn 
up, break over them three eggs; stir until the eggs are cooked; add a httle white 
pepper, and serve on sUces of buttered toast. 

FLANK STEAK. 

This is cut from the boneless part of the flank and is secreted between an out- 
side and inside layer of creamy fat. There are two ways for broOing it. One is 
to shce it diagonally across the grain; the other is to broU it whole. In either 
case brush butter over it and proceed as in broiUng other steaks. It is considered 
by butchers the finest steak, which they frequently reserve for themselves. 

TO BOIL CORNED BEEF. 

The aitch-bone and the brisket are considered the best pieces for boiUng. If 
you buy them in the market already corned, they wiU be fit to put over the 
fire without a previous soaking in water. If you corn them in the brine in 
which you keep your beef through the winter, they must be soaked in cold 
water over night. Put the beef into a pot, cover with sufficient cold water, 
place over a brisk fire, let it come to a boil in half an hour; just before boiling 
remove aU the scum from the pot, place the pot on the back of the fire, let it boil 
very slowly until quite tender. 

A piece weighing eight pounds requires two and a half hours' boiling. If 
you do not wist, to eat it hqt, let it remain in the pot after you take it from the 
fire, until nearly cold, then lay it in a colander to drain, lay a cloth over it to 
retain its fresh appearance; serve with horse-radish and pickles. 

If vegetables are to accompany this, making it the old-fashioned "boiled 
dinner," about three-quarters of an hour before dishing up skim the Uquor free 
from fat and turn part of it out into another kettle, into which put a cabbage 
carefully prepared, cutting it into four quarters; also half a dozen peeled 
medium -sized white turnips, cut into halves; scrape four carrots and four 
parsnips each cut into four pieces. Into the kettle with the meat, about half an 
hour before serving, pour on more water from the boiling tea-kettle, and into 
this put peeled medium-sized potatoes. This dinner should also be accompanied 



MEATS. 105 

by boiled beets, sliced hot, cooked separate from the rest, with vinegar over 
them. Cooking the cabbage separately from the meat prevents the meat from 
having the flavor of cabbage when cold. The carrots, parsnips and turnips wiU 
boil in about an hour. A piece of salt pork was usually boiled with a "New 
England boiled dinner." 

SPICED BEEF RELISH. 

Take two pounds of raw, tender beefsteak, chop it very fine, put into it salt, 
pepper and a Uttle sage, two tablespoonfuls of melted butter; add two rolled 
crackers made very fine, also two weU-beaten eggs. Make it up into the shape 
of a roU and bake it; baste with butter and water before baking. Cut in shces 
when cold. 

FRIED BEEF LIVER. 

Cut it in rather thin shces, say a quarter of an inch thick, pour over it boiling 
water, which closes the pores of the meat, makes it impervious to the fat, 
and at the same time seals up the rich juice of the meat. It may be roUed in 
flour or bread-crumbs, seasoned with salt and pepper, dipped in egg and fried in 
hot fat mixed with one-third butter. 

PRESSED BEEF. 
First have your beef nicely pickled: let it stay in pickle a week; then take 
the thin flanky pieces, such as wUl not make a handsome dish of themselves; 
put on a large potful, and let them boil until perfectly done; then pull to pieces, 
and season just as you do souse, with pepper, salt and allspice; only put it in a 
coarse cloth and press down upon it some very heavy weight. 

The advantage of this recipe is that it makes a most acceptable, presentable 
dish out of a part of the beef that otherwise might be wasted. 

FRENCH STEW. 

Grease the bottom of an iron pot, and place in it three or four pounds of 
beef; be very careful that it does not burn, and turn it until it is nicely browned. 
Set a muffin ring under the beef to prevent its sticking. Add a few shced 
carrots, one or two shced onions, and a cupful of hot water; keep covered, and 
stew slowly until the vegetables are done. Add pepper and salt. If you wish 
more gravy, add hot water, and thicken with flour. Serve on a dish with the 
vegetables. 

TO POT BEEF. 

The roimd is the best piece for potting, and you may use both the upper and 
onder part. Take ten pounds of beef, remove all the fat, cut the lean into 



io6 



MEATS. 



square pieces, two inches thick. Mix together three teaspoonfuls of salt, one of 
pepper, one of cloves, one of mace, one of cinnamon, one of allspice, one of 
thyme, and one of sweet basU. Put a layer of the pieces of beef iato an earthen 
pot, spri nkl e some of this spice mixture over this layer, add a piece of fat salt 
pork, cut as thin, as possible, spriokle a little of the spice mixture over the pork, 
make another layer of the beef with spices and pork, and so on, trntU the pot is 
filled. Pour over the whole three tablespoonfuls of Tarragon vinegar, or, if you 
prefer it, half a pint of Madeira wine; cover the pot with a paste made of flour 
and water, so that no steam can escape. Put the pot into an oven, moderately 
heated, and let it stand there eight hours; then set it away to use when wanted. 

Beef cooked in this manner will keep good a fortnight in moderate weather. 

It is an excellent rehsh for breakfast, and may be eaten either warm or cold. 
When eaten warm, serve with slices of lemon. 

STEWED BRISKET OF BEEF 

Put the part that has the hard fat into a stew-pot, with a small quantity of 
water; let it boil up, and skim it thoroughly; then add carrots, turnips, onions, 
celery and a few pepper-corns. Stew tiU extremely tender; then take out aU the 
flat bones and remove aU the fat from the soup. Either serve that and the meat 
in a tureen, or the soup alone, and the meat on a dish, garnished with some 
vegetables. The following sauce is much admired served with the beef: Take 
half a pint of the soup, and mix it with a spoonful of catsup, a teaspoonful of 
made mustard, a httle flour, a bit of butter and salt; boil all together a few 
minutes, then pour it round the meat. 

DRIED BEEF, WITH CREAM. 

Shave your beef very fine. Put it into a suitable dish on the back of the 
stove; cover with cold water and give it time to soak out to its original size 
before being dried. When it is quite soft and the water has become hot (it must 
not boil), take it off, turn off the water, pour on a cup of cream; if you do not 
have it use milk and butter, a pinch of pepper; let it come to a boil, thicken 
with a tablespoonful of flour, wet up in a httle milk. Serve on dipped toast or 
not, just as one fancies. A nice breakfast dish. 

BEEF CROQUETTES. No. i. 

Chop fine one cup of cold, cooked, lean beef, half a cup of fat, half a cup of 
cold boiled or fried ham; cold pork will do if you have not the ham. Also mince 
up a shoe of onion. Season all with a teaspoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful of 



MEATS. 107 

pepper, and a teaspoonful of powdered sage or parsley, if liked. Heat togethei 
with half a cup of stock or milk; when cool, add a beaten egg. Form the mix- 
ture into baUs, slightly flattened, roU in egg and bread-crumbs, or flour and egg. 
Fry in hot lard or beef drippings. Serve on a platter and garnish with sprigs of 
parsley. Almost any cold meats can be used instead of beef. 

BEEF CROQUETTES. No. 2. 

Take cold roast or corned beef. Put it into a wooden bowl and chop it fine. 
Mix with it about twice the quantity of hot mashed potatoes weU seasoned with 
butter and salt. Beat up an egg and work it into the potato and meat, then 
form the mixture into httle cakes the size of fish baUs. Flatten them a Uttle, 
roll in flour or egg and cracker crumbs, fry in butter and lard mixed, browning 
on both sides. Serve piping hot. 

MEAT AND POTATO CROQUETTES. 

Put in a stew-pan an ounce of butter and a slice of onion minced fine; when thte 
simmers, add a level tablespoonful of sifted flour; stir the mixture untU it 
becomes smooth and frothy; then add half of a cupful of mflk, some seasoning 
of salt and pepper; let all boil, stirring it aUthe while. Now add a cupful of cold 
meat chopped fine and a cupful of cold or hot mashed potato. Mix aU thor- 
oughly and spread on a plate to cool. When it is cool enough, shape it with 
your hands into baUs or roUs. Dip them in beaten egg and roU in cracker or 
bread-crumbs. Drop th^m into hot lard and fry about two minutes a delicate 
brown; take them out with a skimmer and drain them on a piece of brown 
paper. Serve immediately whQe hot. These are very nice. 

Cold rice or hominy may be used in place of the potato; or a cupful of cold 
fish minced fine in place of the meat. 

COLD ROAST, WARMED. 
Cut from the remains of a cold roast the lean meat from the bones into 
small, thin slices. Put over the fire a frying-pan containing a spoonful of butter 
or drippings. Cut up a quarter of an onion and fry it brown, then remove the 
onion, add the meat gravy left from the day before, and if not thick enough, add 
a little flour; salt and pepper. 

Turn the pieces of meat into this, and let them simmer a few minutes. Serve 
hot. 

COLD ROAST, WARMED. No. 2. 

Cold rare roast beef may be made as good as when freshly cooked by slicing, 
seasoning with salt, pepper and bits of butter; put it in a plate or pan with a 
8 



Io8 MEATS. 

3pooDful or two of water, covering closely, and set in the oven until hot, but no 
longer. Cold steak may be shaved very fine with a knife and used the same way. 

Or, if the meat is in small pieces, cover them with buttered letter paper, 
twist each end tightly, and boil them on the gridiron, sprinkling them with 
finely chopped herbs. 

Still another nice way of using cold meats is to mince the lean portions very 
fine, and add to a batter made of one pint of milk, one cup of flour and three 
^gs. Fry hke fritters, and serve with drawn butter or sauce. 

COLD MEAT AND POTATO, BAKED. 

Put in a frying-pan a round tablespoonful of cold butter; when it becomes 
hot, stir into it a teaspoonf ul of chopped onion and a tablespoonful of floiu', stir- 
ring it constantly imtil it is smooth and frothy; then add two-thirds of a cupful 
of cold milk or water. Season this with salt and pepper and allow it to come to 
a boU; then add a cupful of cold meat finely chopped and cleared from bone and 
skill; let this aJl heat thoroughly; then turn it into a shallow dish well buttered. 
Spread hot or cold mashed potatoes over the top, and cook for fifteen or twenty 
minutes in a moderate hot oven. 

Cold hominy or rice may be used in place of mashed potatoes, and is equally 
as good. 

BEEF HASH. No. i. 

Chop rather finely cold roast beef or pieces of beef steak, also chop twice as 
much cold boiled potatoes. Put over the fu-e a stew-pan or frying-pan, in which 
put a piece of butter as large as required to season it well, add pepper and salt, 
moisten with beef gravy if you have it, if not, with hot water; cover and let it 
steam and heat through thoroughly, stirring occasionally, so that the ingredients 
be evenly distributed, and to keep the hash from sticking to the bottom of the 
pan. When done it should not be at aU watery, nor yet dry, but have sufficient 
adhesiveness to stand well on a dish, or buttered toast. Many hke the flavor of 
onion; if so, fry two or three shoes in the butter before adding the hash. 
Corned beef makes exceUent hash. 

BEEF HASH. No. 2. 

Chop cold roast beef, or pieces of beefsteak; fry half an onion in a piece of 

butter; when the onion is brown, add the chopped beef; season with a httle salt 

and pepper; moisten with the beef gfavy, if you have any, if not, with sufficient 

water and a little butter; cook long enough to be hot, but no longer, as much 

cooking toughens the meat. An excellent breakfast dish. 

—Prof. BM. 



MEATS. 109 

Some prefer to let a crust form on the bottom and turn the liash brown side 
uppermost. Served with poached eggs on top. 

HAMBURGER STEAK. 

Take a pound of raw flank or round steak, without any fat, bone or stringy 
pieces. Chop it tmtil a perfect mince; it cannot be chopped too fine. Also chop 
a small onion quite fine, and mix well with the meat. Season with salt and 
pepper; make into cakes as large as a biscuit, but quite flat, or into one large flat 
cake a httle less than half an inch thick. Have ready a frying-pan, with 
butter and lard mixed; when boiling hot, put in the steak and fry brown. 
Garnish with celery top around the edge of the platter and two or three slices of 
lemon on the top of the meat. 

A brown gi-avy made from the grease the steak was fried in, and poured over 
the meat, enriches it. 

TO ROAST BEEF HEART. 

Wash it carefully and open it sufficiently to remove the ventricles, then soak 

it in cold water until the blood is discharged; wipe it dry and stuff it nicely with 

dressing, as for turkey; roast it about an hour and a half. Serve it with the 

gravy, which should be thickened with some of the stuffing, and a glass of wine. 

It is very nice hashed. Served with currant jelly. 

— Palmer House, Chicago. 

STEWED BEEF KIDNEY. 

Cut the kidney into slices, season highly with pepper and salt, fry it a light 
brown, take out the slices, then pour a little warm water into the pan, dredge in 
some flour, put in slices of kidney again; let them stew very gently; add some 
parsley if liked. Sheep's kidneys may be spUt open, broiled over a clear fire, and 
served with a piece of butter placed on each half. 

BEEF'S HEART, STEWED. 

After washing the heart thoroughly, cut it up iato squares half an inch long; 
put them into a sauce-pan with water enough to cover them. If any sciun 
rises, skim it off. Now take out the meat, strain the liquor, and put back the 
meat, also add a sliced onion, some parsley, a head of celery chopped fine, pepper 
and salt, and a piece of butter. Stew until the meat is very tender. Stir up a 
tablespoonful of brown flour with a small quantity of water, and thicken the 
whole. Boil up and serve. 



no MEATS. 

BOILED BEEF TONGUE. 

Wash a fresh tongue and just cover it with water in the pot; put in a pint of 
Bait and a small red pepper; add more water as it evaporates, so as to keep the 
tongue nearly covered until done — when it can be easily pierced with a fork; take 
it out, and if wanted soon, take off the skin and set it away to cool. If wanted 
for future use, do not peel until it is required. A cupful of salt will do for three 
tongues, if you have that number to boU; but do not fail to keep water enough 
in the pot to keep them covered while boiling. If salt tongues are used, soak 
them over night, of com-se omitting the salt when boiling. Or, after peeling a 
tongue, place it in a sauce-pan with one cup of water, half a cup vinegar, four 
tablespoonfuls sugar, and cook until the liquor is evaporated. 

SPICED BEEF TONGUE. 

Eub into each tongue a mixtiu-e made of half a pound of brown sugar, a piece 
of saltpetre the size of a pea, and a tablespoonful of ground cloves; put it in a 
brine made of three-quarters of a pound of salt to two quarts of water and 
keep covered. Pickle two weeks, then wash weU and dry with a cloth; roll out 
a thin paste made of flour and water, smear it aU over the tongue and place in a 
pan to bake slowly; baste well with lard and hot water; when done scrape off 
the paste and skin. 

TO BOIL TRIPE. 

Wash it well in warm water, and trim it nicely, taking off aU the fat. Cut 
into small pieces, and put it on to boil five hours before dinner in water enough 
to cover it very well. After it has boiled four hours, pour off the water, season 
the tripe with pepper and salt, and put it into a pot with milk and water mixed 
in equal quantities. Boil it an hour in the milk and water. 

BoU in a sauce-pan ten or a dozen onions. When they are quite soft, drain 
them in a colander, and mash them. Wipe out your sauce-pan and put them on 
again, with a bit of butter rolled in flour and a wineglass of cream or milk. Let 
them bon up, and add them to the tripe just before you send it to table. Eat it 
with pepper, vinegar and mustard. 

It is best to give tripe its flrst and longest boiling the day before it is wanted. 

TO FRY TRIPE. 

Boil the tripe the day before tiU. it is quite tender, which it will not be in less 
than four or five hours. Then cover it and set it away. Next day cut it into 
long slips, and dip each piece into beaten yolk of egg, and afterwards roll them 



MEATS. 1 1 1 

in grated bread-crumbs. Have ready in a frying-pan over the fire some good 
beef -dripping. When it is boiling hot put in the tripe, and fry it about ten 
minutes, till of a hght brown. 

You may serve it with onion sauce. 

Boiled tripe that has been left from the dinner of the preceding day may be 
fried in this manner. 

FRICASSEED TRIPE. 

Cut a pound of tripe in narrow strips, put a small cup of water or milk to it, 
add a bit of butter the size of an egg, dredge in a large teaspoonful of flour, or 
work it with the butter; season with pepper and salt, let it simmer gently for 
half an hour, serve hot. A bimch of parsley cut small axid put with it is an 
knprovement. 

Some put in oysters five minutes before dishing up. 

TRIPE LYONNAISE. 

Cut up half a pound of cold boiled tripe into neat squares. Put two ounces 
of butter and a tablespoonful of chopped onion in a frying-pan and fry to a deh- 
cate brown; add to the tripe a teaspoonful of chopped parsley and a little strong 
vinegar, salt, and cayenne; stir the pan to prevent burning. Cover the bottom 
of a platter with tomato-sauce, add the contents of the pan and serve. 

TO CLARIFY BEEF DRIPPINGS. 

Drippings accumulated from different cooked meats of beef or veal can be 
clarified by putting it into a basin and shcing into it a raw potato, allowing it to 
boil long enough for the potato to brown, which causes all impm-ities to dis- 
appear. Eemove from the fire, and when cool drain it off from the sediment 
that settles at the bottom. Turn it into basins or smaU jars and set it in a cool 
place for future use. When mixed with an equal amount of butter it answers 
the same purpose as clear butter for frying and basting any meats excepting 
game and poultry. 

Mutton drippings impart an unpleasant flavor to anything cooked outside of 
its kind. 

ROAST LOIN OF VEAL. 

Prepare it the same as any roast, leaving in the kidney, around which put 
considerable salt. Make a dressing the same as for fowls; unroU the loin, put 
the stuffing well around the kidney, fold and secure with several coils of white 
cotton twine wound around in all directions; place in a dripping-pan with the 



112 MEATS. 

thick side down, and put in a rather hot oven, graduated after it conunences to 
roast to moderate; in half an hour add a Uttle hot water to the pan, and baste 
often; in another half hour turn over the roast, and when about done dredge 
lightly with flour and baste with melted butter. Before serving, carefully 
remove the twine. A roast of foiu- to five pounds will bake in about two hours. 
For a gravy, skim off some of the fat if there is too much in the drippings; 
dredge in some flour, stir until brown, add some hot water if necessary, boil a 
few minutes, stir in such sweet herbs as fancied, and put in a gravy boat. Serve 
with green peas and lemon jelly. Is very nice sliced cold for luiich, and Wor- 
cestershire or ChUi sauce forms a fine relish. 

ROAST FILLET OF VEAL. 

Select a nice fiUet, take out the bone, fill up the space with stuffing, and also 
put a good layer under the fat. Truss it of a good shape by drawing the fat 
roimd, and tie it up with tape. Cook it rather moderately at first, and baste 
with butter. It should have careful attention and frequent basting, that the fat 
may not bum. Eoast from three to four hours, according to the size. After it 
is dished, pom* melted butter over it; serve with ham or bacon, and fresh 
cucumbers, if in season. Veal, hke all other meat, should be weU washed in 
cold water before cooking and wiped thoroughly dry with a clean cloth. Cold 
fillet of veal is very good stewed with tomatoes and an onion or two. 

In roasting veal, care must be taken that it is not at first placed in too hot 
an oven; the fat of a loin, one of the most deUcate joints of veal, should be 
covered with greased paper; a fillet, also, should have on the caul until nearly 
done enough. 

BOILED FILLET OF VEAL. 

Choose a small, dehcate fillet; prepare as for roasting, or stuff it with an 
oyster force-meat; after having washed it thoroughly, cover it with water and 
let it boil very gently three and a half or four hours, keeping it well skimmed. 
Send it to the table with a rich white sauce, or, if stuffed with oysters, a tureen 
of oyster sauce. Garnish with stewed celery and slices of bacon. A boiled 
tongue should be served with it. 

VEAL PUDDING. 

Cut about two pounds of lean veal into small coUops a quarter of an inch in 
thickness; put a piece of butter the size of an egg into a very clean frying-pan to 
melt; then lay in the veal and a few slices of bacon, a small sprig of thyme, and 
a seasoning of pepper and salt; place the pan over a slow fire for about te» 



MEATS. 113 

minutes, then add two or three spoonfuls of warm water. Just boil it up, and 
then let it stand to cool. Line a puddiag-dish with a good suet crust, lay in the 
veal and bacon, pour the gravy over it; roU out a piece of paste to form a lid, 
place it over, press it close with the thvmib, tie the basin in a pudding cloth, and 
put it into a sauce-pan of boiling water, keeping continually boiling until done, 
or about one hour. 

FRIED VEAL CUTLETS. 

Put into a frying-pan two or three tablespoonfuls of lard or beef drippings. 
When boiling hot lay in the cutlets, well seasoned with salt and pepper, and 
dredged with floiu-. Brown nicely on both sides, then remove the meat, and if 
you have more grease than is necessary for the gravy, put it aside for further 
use. Eeserve a tablespoonful or more, and rub into it a tablespoonful of flour, 
with the back of the spoon, until it is a smooth, rich brown color; then add 
gradually a cup of cold water and season with pepper and salt. When the gravy 
is boiled up well return the meat to the pan and gravy. Cover it closely and 
allow it to stew gently on the back of the range for fifteen minutes. This 
softens the meat, and with this gravy it makes a nice breakfast dish. 

Another mode is to simply fry the cutlets, and afterwards turning off some 
of the grease they were fried in and then adding to that left in the pan a few 
drops of hot water, turning the whole over the fried chops. 

FRIED VEAL CHOPS. (Plain.) 

Sprinkle over them salt and pepper, then dip them in beaten egg and cracker- 
crumbs, and fry in drippings, or hot lard and butter mixed. If you wish a gravy 
with them, add a tablespoonful of flour to the gravy they were fried in and turn 
in cream or milk; season to taste with salt and pepper. Boil up and serve hot 
with the gravy in a separate dish. This dish is very fine accompanied with a 
few sound fresh tomatoes, sliced and fried in the same grease the cutlets were, 
and all dished on the same platter. 

VEAL COLLOPS. 

Cut veal from the leg or other lean part into pieces the size of an oyster. 
Season with pepper, salt and a little mace; rub some over each piece; dip in egg, 
then into cracker-crumbs, and fry. They both look and taste like oysters. 

VEAL OLIVES. 

Cut up a sKce of a fillet of veal, about half an inch thick, into squares of 
three inches. Mix up a little salt pork, chopped with bread-crumbs, one onion, 



114 MEATS. 

a little pepper, salt, sweet marjoram, and one egg well beaten; put this mixture 
upon the pieces of veal, fastening the four corners together with little bird 
skewers; lay them in a pan with a sufficient veal gravy or light stock to cover 
the bottom of the pan, dredge with flour, and set in a hot oven. When browned 
on top, put a small bit of butter on each, and let them remain xmtil quite tender, 
which will take twenty minutes. Serve with horse-radish. 

VEAL CHEESE. 

Prepare equal quantities of boiled sKced veal and smoked tongue. Pound the 
slices separately in a mortar, moistening with butter as you proceed; then pack it 
in a jar or pail, mixing it in alternate layers; first, the tongue and then the veal, 
BO that when cut it will look variegated. Press it down hard and pour melted 
butter over the top. Keep it well covered and in a dry place. Nice for sand- 
wiches, or shced cold for lunch. 

VEAL CROQUETTES. 

Mince a coffee cup of cold veal in a chopping bowl, adding a httle cold ham, 
and two or three shces of onion, a pinch of mace, powdered parsley and pepper, 
Bome salt. Let a pint of milk or cream come to the boihng point, then add a 
tablespoonfxil of cold butter, then the above mixture. Beat up two eggs and 
mix with a teaspoonful of corn-starch or flour, and add to the rest; cook it all 
about ten minutes, stirring with care. Eemove from the fire, and spread it on 
a platter, roU it into balls, when cooled flatten each; dip them in egg and bread- 
crumbs, and fry in a wire basket, dipped in hot lard. 

BROILED VEAL CUTLETS. (Fine.) 

Two or three pounds of veal cutlets, egg and bread-crumbs, two tablespoon- 
fuls of minced savory herbs, salt and pepper to taste, a little grated nutmeg. 

Cut the cutlets about three-quarters of an inch in thickness, flatten them, and 
brush them over with the yolk of an egg; dip them into bread-crumbs and 
minced herbs, season with pepper and salt, and fold each cutlet in a piece of white 
letter paper well buttered; twist the ends, and broil over a clear fire; when done 
remove the paper. Cooked this way, they retain aU the flavor. 

VEAL POT-PIE. 

Procure a nice breast or brisket of veal, weU jointed, put the pieces into the 
pot with one quart of water to every five pounds of meat; put the pot over a 
slow fire; just before it comes to a boil, skim it well and pour in a teacupful of 
cold water; then turn over the meat in order that aU the scum may rise, remove 



MEATS. 115 

all the scum, boil quite hard, season with pepper and salt to your taste, always 
remembering that the crust will take up part of the seasoning; when this is 
done cut off your crust in pieces of equal size, but do not roll or mould them; 
lay them on top of the meat, so as to cover it; put the hd on the pot closely, let 
the whole boil slowly one hour. If the hd does not fit the pot closely, wrap a 
cloth around it, in order that no steam shall escape; and by no means allow the 
pot to st(yp hoiling. 

The crust for pot-pie should be raised with yeast. To three pints of florn* add 
two ounces of butter, a little salt, and wet with milk sufiBcient to make a soft 
dough; knead it well and set it away to rise; when quite Ught, mould and knead 
it again, and let it stand, m winter, one hour, in summer, one half hoiu", when 
it win be ready to cut. 

In summer you had better add one-half a teaspoonful of soda when you 
knead it the second time, or you may wet it with water, and add another bit of 
butter. 

VEAL PIE. 

Out the veal into rather small pieces or slices, put it in a stew-pan, with hot 
water to cover it; add to it a tablespoonful of salt, and set it over the fire; take 
off the scum as it rises; when the meat is tender turn it into a dish to cool; take 
out all the small bones, butter a tin or earthen basin or pudding-pan, Une it with 
pie paste, lay some of the parboiled meat in to half fill it; put bits of butter in 
the size of a hickory nut all over the meat; shake pepper over, dredge wheat flour 
over, until it looks white, then fill it nearly to the top with some of the water in 
which the meat was boiled; roU a cover for the top of the crust, puff -paste it, 
giving it two or three turns, and roU it to nearly half an inch thickness; cut a 
slit in the centre, and make several small incisions on either side of it, put the 
crust on, trim the edges neatly with a knife; bate one hour in a quick oven. A 
breast of veal will make two two-quart basin pies; half a pound of nice corned 
pork, cut in thin shces, and parboiled with the meat, wiU make it very nice, and 
very Mttle, if any, butter, will be required for the pie; when pork is used, no 
other salt will be necessary. Many are fond of thin slices of sw««t ham cooked 
with the veal for pie. 

VEAL STEW. 

Cut up two or three pounds of veal into pieces three inches long and one 
thick. Wash it, put it in your stew-pan with two quarts of water, let it boil 
skim it well, and, when all the scum is removed, add pepper and salt to your 



Il6 MEATS. 

taste, and a small piece of butter; pare and cut in halves twdve small Irish 
potatoes, put them into the stew-pan; when it boils, have ready a batter made 
with two eggs, two spoonfuls of cream or milk, a httle salt and flour enough to 
make it a httle thicker than for pan-cakes; drop this into the stew, a spoonful at 
a time, while it is boihng; when aU is in, cover the pan closely so that no steara 
can escape; let it boil twenty minutes, and serve in a deep dish. 

VEAL LOAF. 

Three pounds of raw veal, chopped very fine, butter the size of an egg, three 
^gs, three tablespoonfuls of cream or milk; if milk use a small piece of butter; 
mix tbe eggs and cream together; mix with the veal rour pounded crackers, one 
teaspoonful of black pepper, one large tablespoonful salt, one large tablespoonful 
of sage; mix weU together and form into a loaf. Bake two and one-half hours, 
basting with butter and water while baking. Serve cut in thin slices. 

VEAL FOR LUNCH. 

Butter a good-sized bowl, and hne it with thin sUces of hard-boiled eggs; hav« 
veal and ham both in very thin shoes; place in the bowl a layer of veal, with 
pepper and salt, then a layer of ham, omitting the salt, then a layer of veal, and 
so on, alternating with veal and ham, until the bowl is filled; make a paste of 
flour and water, as stiff as it can be rolled out; cover the contents of the bowl 
with the paste, and over this tie a double cotton cloth; put the bowl into a sauce- 
pan, or other vessel, with water just up to the rim of the bowl, and boil three 
hours; then take it from the fire, remove the cloth and paste, and let it stand 
until the next day, when it may be turned out and served in very thin slices. 
An excellent lunch in travelling. 

VEAL PATTIES. 

Cut portions of the neck or breast of veal into small pieces, and, with a Uttlo 
salt pork cut fine, stew gently for ten or fifteen minutes; season with pepper and 
salt, and a small piece of celery chopped coarsely, also of the yellow top, picked 
(not chopped) up; stir in a paste made of a tablespoonful of fiour the yolk of one 
egg, and milk to form a thin batter; let aU come to a boil, and it is ready for the 
patties. Make the patties of a hght, flaky crust, as for tarts, cut round, the 
size of a small sauce-plate; the centre of each, for about three inches, cut half 
way through, to be raised and serve as a cover. Put a spoonful of the stew in 
each crust, lay on the top, and serve. Stewed oysters or lamb may be used is 
place of veal.

BRAISED VEAL. 

Take a piece of the shoulder weighing about five pounds. Have the bone 
removed and tie up the meat to make it firm. Put a piece of butter the size of 
haJf an egg, together with a few shavings of onion, into a kettle or stone crock 
and let it get hot. Salt and pepper the veal and put it into the kettle, cover it 
tightly and put it over a medium fire until the meat is brown on both sides, 
tumiug it occasionally. Then set the kettle back on the stove, where it wiU 
simmer slowly for about two hours and a half. Before setting the meat back on 
the stove, see if the juice of the meat together with the butter do not make gravy 
enough, and if not, put in about two tablespoonf uls of hot water. When the 
gravy is cold it will be hke jeUy. It can be served hot with the hot meat, or cold 
with the cold meat. 

BAKED CALF'S HEAD. 

BoU a calf's head (after having cleaned it) until tender, then spUt it in two, 
and keep the best half; (bone it if you hke); cut the meat from the other in uni- 
form pieces; the size of an oyster; put bits of butter, the size of a nutmeg, all 
over the best half of the head; sprinkle pepper over it, and dredge on flour until 
it looks white, then set it on a trivet or muffin rings in a dripping-pan; put a 
cup of water into the pan, and set it in a hot oven; turn it that it may brown 
evenly; baste once or twice. Whilst this is doing, dip the prepared pieces of 
the head in wheat flour or batter, and fry in hot lard or beef dripping a deUcate 
brown; season with pepper and salt and shoes of lemon, if hked. When the 
roast is done put it on a hot dish, lay the fried pieces around it, and cover it with 
a tin cover; put the gravy from the dripping-pan into the pan in which the 
pieces were fried, with the shoes of lemon, and a tablespoonful of browned flour, 
and, if necessary, a httle hot water. Let it boil up once, and strain it into a 
gravy boat, and serve with the meat. 

CALF'S HEAD CHEESE. 

BoU a calf's head in water enough to cover it, until the meat leaves the bones; 
then take it with a skimmer into a wooden bowl or tray; take from it every 
particle of bone; chop it small; season with pepper and salt, a heaping table- 
spoonful of salt, and a teaspoonful of pepper wUl be sufficient; if liked, add a 
tablespoonful of finely chopped sweet herbs; lay in a cloth in a colander, put the 
minced meat into it, then fold the cloth closely over it, lay a plate over, and on 
it a gentle weight. When cold it may be shced thin for supper or sandwiches. 
Spread each shoe with made mustard.

BRAIN CUTLETS. 

Well wash the hrains and soak them in cold water till white. Parboil them 
till tender in a small sauce-pan for about a quarter of an hour; then thoroughly 
drain them, and place them on a board. Divide them into small pieces with a 
knife. Dip each piece into flour, and then roU them in egg and bread-crumbs, 
and fry them, in butter or well-clarified dripping. Serve very hot with gravy. 
Another way of doing brains is to prepare them as above, and then stew them 
gently in rich stock, like stewed sweetbreads. They are also nice plainly boiled,, 
and served with parsley and butter sauce. 

CALF'S HEAD BOILED. 

Put the head into boiling water and let it remain about five minutes; take it 
out, hold it by the ear, and with the back of the knife scrape off the hair, (should 
it not come off easily, dip the head again in boiUng water). When perfectly 
clean, take the eyes out, cut off the ears, and remove the brain, which soak for 
an hour in warm water. Put the head to soak in hot water a few minutes ta 
make it look white, and then have ready a stew-pan, into which lay the head; 
cover it with cold water, and bring it gradually to boil. Eemove the sciun, and 
add a httle salt, which increases it and causes it to rise to the top. Simmer it 
very gently from two and a half to three hours, or until the bones will slip out 
easily, and when nearly done, boil the brains fifteen or twenty niinutes; skin and 
chop them, (not too finely), and add a tablespoonful of minced parsley which has 
been previously scalded; also a pinch of pepper, salt; then stir into this four 
tablespoonfuls of melted butter, set it on the back of the range to keep it hot. 
When the head is done, take it up, and drain very dry. Score the top and rub 
it over with melted butter; dredge it with flour, and set it in the oven to brown. 

When you serve the head, have it accompanied with a gravy boat of melted 
butter and minced parsley. 

CALF'S LIVER AND BACON. 

Slice the hver a quarter of an inch thick; pour hot water over it, and let it 
remain for a few minutes to clear it from blood; then dry it in a cloth. Take a 
pound of bacon, or as much as you require, and cut the same number of thin 
slices as you have of hver; fry the bacon to a nice crisp; take it out and keep it 
hot; then fry the hver in the same pan, having first seasoned it with pepper and 
salt and dredged in a little flour; lay it in the hot bacon fat and fry it a nice 
brown. Serve it with a slice of bacon on the top of each shoe of hver. 



MEATS. 119 

If you wish a gravy with it, pour off most of the fat from the frying-pan, put 
in about two ounces of butter, a tablespoonful of flour well rubbed in, add a cup 
of water, salt and pepper, give it one boil and serve in a gravy boat. 

Another way. — Cut the hver in nice thin shoes, pour boiling water over it, 
and let it stand about five minutes; then drain and put in a dripping-pan with 
three or four thin shces of salt pork or bacon; pepper and salt, and put in the 
oven, letting it cook untU thoroughly done, then serve with a cream or mUk 
gra\cy pom-ed over it. 

Calf's hver and bacon are very good broiled after cutting each in thin slices 
Season with butter, pepper and salt. 

CROQUETTES OF SWEETBREADS. 

Take four veal sweetbreads, soak them for an hour in cold salted water, first remov 
ing the pipes and membranes; then put them into boiling salted water with a table- 
spoonful of vinegar, and cook them twenty minutes, then drop them again into cold 
water to harden. Now remove them, chop them very fine, almost to a paste. SeasoB 
with salt, pepper and a teaspoonful of grated onion; add the beaten yolks of thre« 
raw eggs, one tablespoonful of butter, half a cupful of cream, and sufficient fine 
cracker crumbs to make stiff enough to roll out into little balls or cork-shaped cro- 
quettes. Have ready a frying-kettle half -full of fat over the fire, a dish containing 
three smoothly beaten eggs, a large platter of cracker dust; wet the hands with cold 
water and make the mixture in shape ; afterwards rolling them in the cracker dust, 
then into the beaten Qgg, and again in the cracker dust; smooth them on the outside 
and drop them carefully in the hot fat. When the croquettes are fried a nice golden 
brown, put them on a brown paper a moment to free them from grease. Serve hot 
with sliced lemon or parsley. 

SWEETBREADS. 

There are two in a calf, which are considered dehcacies. Select the largest. 
The color shovQd be clear and a shade darker than the fat. Before cooking in 
any manner let them he for half an hour in tepid water; then throw into hot 
water to whiten and harden, after which draw off the outer casing, remove the 
httle pipes, and cut into thin shces. They should always be thoroughly cooked. 

FRIED SWEETBREADS. 

After preparing them as above they are put into hot fat and butter, and fried 
the same as lamb chop, also broiled the same, first rolling them in egg and 
cracker-crumbs. BAKED SWEETBREADS, 

Three sweetbreads, egg and bread-crumbs, oiled butter, three slices of toast, 
brown gravy. 

Choose large, white sweetbreads; put them into warm water to draw out the 



I20 MEATS. 

blood, and to improve their color: let them remain for rather more than one 
hour; then put them into boiling water, and allow them to simmer for about ten 
minutes, which renders them firm. Take them up, drain them, brush over the 
egg, sprinkle with bread-crumbs; dip them in egg again, and then into more 
bread-crumbs. Drop on them a httle oUed butter, and put the sweetbreads into 
a moderately heated oven, and let them bake for nearly three-quarters of an hour. 
Make three pieces of toast; place the sweetbreads on the toast, and pour round, 
but not over them, a good brown gravy. 

FRICASSEED SWEETBREADS. 

If they are uncooked, cut into thin sUces, let them simmer in a rich gravy for 
three-quarters of an hoin-, add a well-beaten egg, two tablespoonfuls of cream 
and a tablespoonful of chopped parsley; stir all together for a few minutes and 
serve immediately.

ROAST MUTTON. 
The pieces mostly used for roasting are the hind quarter of the sheep, called 
the loin and leg, the fore-quarter, the shoulder, also the chine or saddle, which is 
the two loins together. Every part should be trimmed off that cannot be eaten; 
then wash weU and dry with a clean cloth; lay it in your dripping-pan and put 
in a httle water to baste it with at first; then afterward with its own gravy. 
Allow, in roasting, about twelve minutes to the pound; that is, if yovir fire is 
strong, which it should be. It should not be salted at first, as that tends to 
harden it, and draws out too much of the blood or juices; but salt soon after it 
begins to roast well. If there is danger of its browning too fast, cover it with a 
sheet of white paper. Baste it often, and about a quarter of an hour before you 
think it will be done dredge the meat very hghtly with flour and baste it with 
butter. Skim the gravy well and thicken very sUghtly with brown floiu-. Serve 
with currant jelly or other tart sauce. 

BONED LEG OF MUTTON ROASTED. 

Take the bone out of a small leg of mutton, without spoiling the skin if 
possible, then cut off most of the fat. In the hole whence the bone was 
taken, fill with a stuffing made the same as for fowls, adding to it part of an 



MEATS. 121 

onion finely minced. Sew the leg up underneath to prevent the dressing or 
stuflBng from falling out. Bind and tie it up compactly; put it in a roasting- 
pan, turn in a cupful of hot water and place it in a moderately hot oven, bast- 
ing it occasionally. When partly cooked season with salt and pepper. When 
thoroughly cooked, remove and place the leg on a warm platter; skim the grease 
from the top of the drippings, add a cup of water and thicken with a spoonful 
of dissolved flour. Send the gravy to the table in a gravy dish, also a dish of 
currant jelly. 

BOILED LEG OF MUTTON. 
To prepare a leg of mutton for boiling, wash it clean, cut a small piece off the 
shank bone, and trim the knuckle. Put it into a pot with water enough to cover 
it, and boil gently from two to three hours, skimming weU. Then take it from 
the fire, and keeping the pot well covered, let it finish by remaining in the steam 
for ten or fifteen minutes. Serve it up with a sauce-boat of melted butter, into 
which a teacupful of capers or nasturtiums, have been stirred. If the broth is to 
be used for soup, put in a little salt while boiling; if not, salt it well when partly 
done, and boil the meat in a cloth, 

BRAISED LEG OF MUTTON, 
'Riifi recipe can be varied either by preparing the leg with a stuffing, placed in 
the cavity after having the bone removed, or cooking it without. Having lined 
the bottom of a thick iron kettle or stew-pan with a few thin slices of bacon, put 
over the bacon four carrots, three onions, a bunch of savory herbs; then over 
these place the leg of mutton. Cover the whole with a few more shoes of bacon, 
then pour over half of a pint of water. Cover with a tight cover and stew very 
gently for fotu- hoiu^, basting the leg occasionally with its own hquor, and sea^ 
soning it with salt and pepper as soon as it begins to be tender. When cooked 
strain the gravy, thicken with a spoonfvil of flour, (it should be quite brown),, 
pour some of it over the meat and send the remainder to the table in a tureen,, 
to be served with the mutton when carved. Garnish the dish aroimd the leg 
with potatoes cut in the shape of ohves and fried a light brown in butter. 

LEG OF MUTTON A LA VENISON. 
Eemove aU the rough fat from the mutton and lay it in a deep earthen dish;- 
rub into it thoroughly the following: One tablespoonful of salt, one each of 
eelery-salt, brown sugar, black pepper, English mustard, allspice, and some sweet 
herbs, all powdered and mixed; after which pour over it slowly a teacup of good- 
vinegar, cover tightly, and set in a cool place four or five days, turning it andi 



122 MEATS. 

basting often with the Uquid each day. To cook, put in a kettle a quart of boil- 
ing water, place over it an inverted shallow pan, and on it lay the meat just aa 
removed from the pickle; cover the kettle tightly and stew four hours. Do not 
let the water touch the meat. Add a cup of hot water to the pickle remaining 
and baste with it. When done, thicken the liquid with flour and strain through 
a fine sieve, to serve with the meat; also a reUsh of cmrant jeUy, the same as for 
venison. 

This is a fine dish when the directions are faithfully followed. 

STEAMED LEG OF MUTTON. 
Wash and put the leg in a steamer and cook it until tender, then place in a 
roasting pan, salt and dredge well with flour and set in a hot oven until nicely 
browned; the water that remains in the bottom of the steamer may be used for 
soup. Serve with currant jeUy. 

HASHED MUTTON. 

Cut into small 'lieces the lean of some cold mutton that has been underdone, 
and season it with /epper and salt. Take the bones and other trimmings, put 
them into a sauce-pan with as much water as will cover them, and some sUced 
onions, and let them stew till you have drawn from them a good gravy. Having 
skimmed it weU, strain the gravy into a stew-pan, and put the mutton into it. 
Have ready-boiled some carrots, turnips, potatoes and onions. Shce them and 
add to the meat and gravy. Set the pan on the flre and let it simmer tiU the 
meat is warmed through, but do not allow it to boil, as it has been once cooked 
already. Cover the bottom of a dish with sUces of buttered toast. Lay the meat 
and vegetables upon it, and pour over them the gravy. 

Tomatoes will be found an improvement. 

If green peas or Lima beans are in season, yott iiiay boil them and put them 
to the hashed mutton, leaving out the other vegetables, or serving them up 
separately. 

BROILED MUTTON CHOPS. 
Loin of mutton, pepper and salt, a small piece of butter. Cut the chops from 
a tenderloin of mutton, remove a portion of the fat, and trim them into a nicfi 
shape; slightly beat and level them; place the gridiron over a bright, clear fire, 
rub the bars with a little fat, and lay on the chops. While broihng frequently 
turn them, and in about eight minutes they wiU be done. Season with peppef 
and salt, dish them on a very hot dish, rub a small piece of butter on eadi chop, 
and serve very hot and expeditiously. Nice with tomato sauce poured ovot them. 



MEATS. 123 

FRIED MUTTON CHOPS. No. I. 

Put into a frying-pan a tablespoonful of cold lard and butter mixed : have 
some fine mutton chops without much fat; trim off the skin. Dip each in wheat 
flour, or rolled cracker, and beaten egg, then lay them into the hot grease, 
sprinkle with salt and pepper, fry on both sides a fine brown. When done, take 
them up and place on a hot dish. If you wish a made gravy, turn off the super- 
fluous grease, if any, stir into the hot gravy remaining a heaping spoonful of 
flour, stirring it until smooth and free from lumps, then turn into that a cup of 
cold water or milk; season with pepper and salt, let it boil up thick. You can 
serve it in a separate dish or pour it over the chops. Tomato sauce is con- 
sidered fine, turned over a dish of hot fried or broiled chops. 

FRIED MUTTON CHOPS. No. 2, 

Prepare the chops by trimming off all extra fat and skin, season them with 
gait and pepper; dip each chop in beaten egg, then in rolled cracker or bread- 
crumbs ; dip again in the ^^'g and crumbs, and so on until they are well coated 
with the crumbs. Have ready a deep spider containing a pound or more of lard, 
hot enough to fry crullers. Drop into this hot lard the chops, frying only a few 
at one time, as too many cool the fat. Fry them brown, and serve up hot and 
dry, on a warm platter. 

MUTTON CUTLETS. (Baked). 
Prepare them the same as for frying, lay them in a dripping pan with a very 
little water at the bottom. Bake quickly, and baste often with butter and water. 
Make a little brown gravy and txim over them when they are served. 

BAKED MUTTON CHOPS AND POTATOES. 
Wash and peel some good potatoes and cut them into slices the thickness of 
a penny -piece. The quantity of potatoes must, of course, be decided according 
to the number of persons to whom they have to be served; but it is a safe plan 
to allow two, or even three, potatoes for each person. After the potatoes are 
sUced, wash them in two or three waters, to thoroughly cleanse them; then 
arrange them neatly (in layers) in a brown stone dish proper for baking purposes. 
Sprinkle a little salt and pepper between each layer, and add a sufficient quantity 
of cold water to prevent their burning. Place the dish in a very hot oven— on 
the top shelf— so as to brown the potatoes in a few minutes. Have ready some 
nice loin chops (say one for each person); trim off most of the fat; make them 
into a neat rouad shape by putting a small skewer through each. When the 
9 



124 MEATS. 

potatoes are nicely browned, remove the dish from the oven, and place the chops 
on the top. Add a little more salt and pepper, and water if required, and return 
the dish to a cooler part of the oven, where it may be allowed to remain until 
sufficiently cooked, which will be in about three-quarters of an hour. When the 
upper sides of the chops are a nice crisp brown, turn them over so as to brown 
the other side also. If, in the cooking, the potatoes appear to be getting too dry, 
a little more water may be gently poured in at one corner of the dish, only care 
must be taken to see that the water is hot this time— not cold, as at first. The 
dish in which the chops and potatoes are baked must be as neat-looking as possi- 
Dle, as it has to be sent to the table; turning the potatoes out would, of course, 
spoil their appearance. Those who have never tasted this dish have no idea 
how delightful it is. While the chops are baking the gravy drips from them 
among the potatoes, rendering the whole most delicious. 

MUTTONETTES. 

Cut from a leg of mutton slices about half an inch thick. On each slice lay a 
spoonful of stuffing made with bread-crumbs, beaten egg, butter, salt, pepper, 
sage and summer savory. EoU up the shces, pinning with Uttle skewers or 
small wooden toothpicks to keep the dressing in. Put a little butter and water 
in a baking-pan with the muttonettes, and cook in hot oven three-quarters of an 
hour. Baste often, and when done thicken the gravy, pour over the meat, 
garnish with parsley, and serve on hot platter. 

IRISH STEW. 
Time about two horn's. Two and a half pounds of chops, eight potatoes, four 
turnips, four small onions, nearly a quart of water. Take some chops from loin 
of mutton, place them in stew-pan in alternate layers of sHced potatoes and 
chops; add turnips and onions cut into pieces, pour in nearly a quart of cold 
water; cover stew-pan closely, let it stew gently tiU vegetables are ready to mash 
and the greater part of the gravy is absorbed; then place in a dish; serve it up hot. 

MUTTON PUDDING. 
Line a two-quart pudding-basin with some beef suet paste; fill the lining with 
thick mutton cutlets, slightly trimmed, or, if preferred, with steaks cut from the 
leg; season with pepper and salt, some parsley, a little thyme and two slices of 
onion chopped fine, and between each layer of meat, put some shces of potatoes. 
When the pudding is filled, wet the edges of the paste around the top of the 
basin, and cover with a piece of paste rolled out the size of the basin. Faster 
down the edge by bearing aU around with the thumb; and then with the thimifc 



MEATS. 125 

and forefinger twist the edges of the paste over and over so as to give it a corded 
appearance. This pudding can be set in a steamer and steamed, or boiled. The 
time required for cooking is about three hours. When done, turn it out care- 
fully on a platter and serve with a rich gravy under it. 
This is a very good recipe for cooking small birds. 

SCRAMBLED MUTTON. 

Two cups of chopped cold mutton, two tablespoonfuls of hot water, and a 
piece of butter as large as an English walnut. When the meat is hot, break in 
three eggs, and constantly stir until the eggs begin to stiffen. Season with 
pepper and salt. 

SCALLOPED MUTTON AND TOMATOES. 

Over the bottom of an earthen baking-dish place a layer of bread-crumbs, 
and over it alternate layers of cold roast mutton cut in thin shces, and tomatoes 
peeled and shced; season each with salt, pepper and bits of butter, as laid in. 
The top layer should be of tomatoes, spread over with bread-crumbs. Bake 
three-quarters of an hour, and serve immediately. 

LAMB SWEETBREADS AND TOMATO SAUCE. 

Lamb sweetbreads are not always procurable, but a stroll through the markets 
occasionally reveals a small lot of them, which can invariably be had at a low 
price, owing to their excellence being recognized by but few buyers. Wash them 
well in salted water and parboil fifteen minutes; when cool, trim neatly and put 
them in a pan with just butter enough to prevent their bimiing; toss them about 
until a dehcate color; season with salt and pepper and serve, siirrounded with 
tomato sauce. See Sauces. 

ROAST QUARTER OF LAMB. 

Procure a nice hind-quarter, remove some of the fat that is around the kidney, 
skewer the lower joint up to the fillet, place it in a moderate oven, let it heat 
through slowly, then dredge it with salt and flour; quicken the fire, put half a 
pint of water into the dripping-pan, with a teaspoonful of salt. With this liquor 
baste the meat occasionally; serve with lettuce, green peas, and mint sauce. 

A quarter of lamb weighing seven or eight pounds will require two hoiu?s to 
roast. 

A breast of lamb roasted is very sweet, and is considered by many as prefer- 
able to hind-quarter. It requires nearly as long a time to roast as the quarter, 
and should be served in the same manner. 

Make the gravy from the drippings, thickened with flour. 



126 MEATS. 

Tfcrti. mint sauce is made as follows: Take fresh, young spearmint leaves 
stripped from stems; wash and drain them or dry on a cloth, chop very fine, put 
in a gravy tvireen, and to three tablespoonfuls of mint add two of finely pow- 
dered cut-loaf sugar; mix, and let it stand a few minutes; then poiu" over it six 
tablespoonfuls good cider or white-wine vinegar. The sauce should be made 
some time before dinner, so that the flavor of the mint may be well extracted. 

TO BROIL THE FORE-QUARTER OF LAMB. 

Take off the shoulder and lay it upon the gridiron with the breast; cut in two 
parts, to facihtate its cooking; put a tin sheet on top of the meat, and a weight 
upon that; turn the meat around frequently to prevent its burning; turn over 
as soon as cooked on one side; renew the coals occasionally, that all parts may 
cook alike; when done, season with butter, pepper, and salt, — exactly like beef- 
steak. It takes some time to broU it well; but when done it will be found to be 
equal to broiled chicken, the flavor being more delicate than when cooked other- 
wise. Serve with cream sauce, made as follows: Heat a tablespoonful of butter 
in a sauce-pan, add a teaspoonful of flour and stir until perfectly smooth; then 
add, slowly stirring in, a cup of cold milk; let it boil up once, and season to taste 
with salt and pepper and a teaspoonful of finely chopped fresh parsley. Serve 
in a gravy boat, aU hot. 

LAMB STEW. 

Cut up the lamb into small pieces (after removing aU the fat), say about two 
inches square. Wash it well and put it over the fire, with just enough cold 
water to cover it well, and let it heat gradually. It should stew gently until it 
is partly done; then add a few thih slices of salt pork, one or two onions sliced 
up fine, some pepper and salt if needed, and two or three raw potatoes cut up 
into inch pieces. Cover it closely and stew until the meat is tender. Drop in a 
few made dumphngs, made like short biscuit, cut out very small. Cook fifteen 
minutes longer. Thicken the gravy with a httle fiour moistened with milk. 
Serve. 

PRESSED LAMB. 

The meat, either shoulder or leg, should be put to boil in the morning with 
water just enough to cover it; when tender, season with salt and pepper, then 
keep it over the fire until very tender and the juice nearly boiled out. Eemove 
it from the fire-place in a wooden chopping-bowl, season more if necessary, 
chop it up like hash. Place it in a bread-pan, press out aU the juice, and put it 
in a cool place to harden. The pressing is generally done by placing a dish over 
the meat and putting a flat-iron upon that. Nice cut up cold into thin slices, and 



MEATS. 127 

the broth left from the meat would make a nice soup served with it, adding 
vegetables and spices. 

CROQUETTES OF ODDS AND ENDS. 

These are made of any scr^^s or bits of good food that happen to be left 
from one or more meals, and in such small quantities that they cannot be 
warmed up separately. As, for example, a couple of spoonfuls of frizzled beef 
and cream, the lean meat of one mutton chop, one spoonful of minced beef, two 
cold hard-boiled eggs, a httle cold chopped potato, a Uttle mashed potato, a 
chick's leg, aU the gristle and hard outside taken from the meat. These things 
well chopped and seasoned, mixed with one raw egg, a httle flour and butter, 
and boiling water; then made into round cakes, thick hke fish-baUs, and browned 
well vsdth butter in a frying-pan or on a griddle. 

Scraps of hash, cold rice, boiled oatmeal left from breakfast, every kind of 
fresh meat, bits of salt tongue, bacon, pork or ham, bits of poiiltry, and crumbs 
of bread, may be used. They should be put together with care, so as not to have 
them too dry to be palatable, or too moist to cook in shape. Most housekeepers 
would be surprised at the result, making an addition to the breakfast or lunch 
table. Serve on small squares of buttered toast, and with cold celery if in season. 



pork. 

The best parts and those usually used for roasting are the loin, the leg, the 
shoulder, the spare-rib and chine. The hams, shoulders and middlings are 
usually salted, pickled and smoked. Pork requires more thorough cooking than 
most meats; if the least underdone it is unwholesome. 

To choose pork: if the rind is thick and tough, and caimot be easily impressed 
with the finger, it is old; when fresh, it wiU look cool and smooth, and only 
corn-fed pork is good; swiU or stiQ-fed pork is unfit to cure. Fresh pork is in 
season from October to April. When dressing or stuffing is used, there are more 
or less herbs used for seasoning, — sage, summer savory, thyme, and sweet mar- 
joram; these can be found (in the dried, pulverized form, put up in small, Ught 
packages) at most of the best druggists; stiU those raised and gathered at home 
are considered more fresh. 

ROAST PIG. 

Prepare your dressing as for "Dressing for Fowls," adding half an onion, 
chopped fine; set it inside. Take a young pig about six weeks old, wash it 



128 MEATS. 

thoroughly inside and outside, and in another water put a teaspoonful of baking 
soda, and rinse out the inside again; wipe it dry with a fresh towel, salt the 
inside and stuff it with the prepared dressing; making it full and plump, giving 
it its original size and shape. Sew it up, place it in a kneeling posture in the 
dripping-pan, tying the legs in proper position. Pour a Mttle hot salted watei 
into the dripping-pan, baste with butter and water a few times as the pig warms; 
afterwards with gravy from the dripping-pan. When it begins to smoke all ovei 
rub it often with a rag dipped in melted butter. This will keep the skin fronj 
cracking and it stiU will be crisp. It wiU take from two to three hours to 
roast. Make the gravy by skimming off most of the grease; stir into thai 
remaining in the pan a good tablespoon of flour, turn in water to make it the 
right consistency, season with pepper and let aU boil up once. Strain, and if 
you hke wine in it, add half a glass; turn it into a gravy boat. Place the pig 
upon a large, hot platter, surroimded with parsley or celery tops; place a green 
wreath around the neck, and a sprig of celery in its mouth. In carving, cut off 
its head first; spht down the back, take off its hams and shoulders, and separate 
the ribs. 

ROAST LOIN OF PORK. 

Score the skin in strips about a quarter of an inch apart; place it in a dripping- 
pan with a very little water under it; cook it moderately at first, as a high heat 
hardens the rind before the meat is heated through. If it is very lean, it should 
be rubbed with fresh lard or butter when put into the pan. A stuffing might 
be made of bread-crumbs, chopped sage and onions, pepper and salt, and baked 
separately on a pie dish; this method is better than putting it in the meat, as 
many persons have a great aversion to its flavor. A loin weighing about six 
pounds wiU roast in two hours; allow more time if it should be very fat. Make 
a gravy with floiir stirred into the pork drippings. Serve vsrith apple sauce and 
pickles. 

ROAST LEG OF PORK. 

Choose a small leg of fine young pork; cut a sht in the knuckle with a sharp 
knife, and fill the space with sage and onion chopped, and a httle pepper and 
salt. When half done, score the skin in shoes, but do not cut deeper than the 
outer rind. Apple sauce and potatoes should be served with it. The gravy is to 
be made the same way as for beef roast, by turning off all the superfluous fat 
and adding a spoonful of flour stirred with a httle water; add water to make the 
right consistency. Serve in a gravy boat.

BOILED LEG OF PORK. 

For boiling, choose a small, compact, well-filled leg, and rub it well with salt; 
let it remain in pickle for a week or ten days, turning and rubbing it every day. 
An hour before dressing it put it into cold water for an hour, which improves 
the color. If the pork is purchased ready salted, ascertain how long the meat 
has been in pickle, and soak it accordingly. Put it into a boiling-pot, with suffi- 
cient cold water to cover it; let it gradually come to a boU, and remove the scum 
as it rises. Simmer it very gently imtU tender, and do not allow it to boU fast, 
or the knuckle will fall to pieces before the middle of the leg is done. Carrots, 
turnips or parsnips may be boiled with the pork, some of which should be laid 
around the dish as a garnish. 

Time. — A leg of pork weighing eight pounds, three hours after the water 
boUs, and to be simmered very gently. 

FRESH PORK POT-PIE. 

Bon a spare-rib, after removing all the fat and cracking the bones, until 
tender; remove the scum as it rises, and when tender season with salt and 
pepper; half an hour before time for serving the dinner thicken the gravy with 
a httle flour. Have ready another kettle, into which remove all the bones and 
most of the gravy, leaving only sufficient to cover the pot half an inch above the 
rim that rests on the stove; put va. the crust, cover tight, and boil steadily forty-five 
minutes. To prepare the crust, work into Ught dough a small bit of butter, 
roU it out thin, cut it in small square cakes, and lay them on the moulding-board 
until very light. No steam should possibly escape while the crust is cooking, and 
by no means allow the pot to cease boiling. 

ROAST SPARE-RIB. 

Trim off the rough ends neatly, crack the ribs across the middle, rub with 
salt and sprinkle with pepper, fold over, stviff with turkey dressing, sew up 
tightly, place in a dripping-pan with a pint of water, baste frequently, turning 
over once so as to bake both sides equally until a rich brown. 

PORK TENDERLOINS. 

The tenderloins are unlike any other part of the pork in flavor. They may 
be either fried or broiled; the latter being dryer, require to be well-buttered before 
serving, which should be done on a hot platter before the butter becomes ofly. 
Fry them in a httle lard, turning them to have them cooked through; when 
done, remove, and keep hot whUe making a gravy by dredging a httle flour into 



I30 MEATS. 

the hot fat; if not enough add a little butter or lard, stir until browned, and add 
a little milk or cream, stir briskly, and pour over the dish. A Uttle Worcester- 
shire sauce may be added to the gravy if desired. 

PORK CUTLETS. 

Cut them from the leg, and remove the skin; trim them and beat them, and 
sprinkle on salt and pepper. Prepare some beaten egg in a pan; and on a flat 
dish a mixture of bread-crumbs, minced onion and sage. Put some lard or drip- 
pings into a frying pan over the fire, and when it boUs put in the cutlets; 
having dipped every one first in the egg, and then in the seasoning. Fry them 
twenty or thirty minutes, turning them often. After you have taken them out 
of the frying-pan, skim the gravy, dredge in a httle flour, give it one boU, and 
then pour it on the dish round the cutlets. 

Have apple sauce to eat with them. 

Pork cutlets prepared iu this manner may be stewed instead of being fried.^ 
Add to them a little water, and stew them slowly till thoroughly done, keeping 
them closely covered, except when you remove the Hd to skim them. 

PORK CHOPS AND FRIED APPLES. 

Season the chops with salt and pepper and a Kttle powdered sage; dip them 
into bread-crumbs. Fry about twenty minutes, or until they are done. Put 
them on a hot dish; pour off part of the gravy into another pan to make a 
gravy to serve with them, if you choose. Then fry apples which you have sliced 
about two-thirds of an inch thick, cutting them around the apple so that the 
core is in the centre of each piece; then cut out the core. When they are 
browned on one side and partly cooked, turn them carefully with a pan-cake 
turner, and finish cooking; dish around the chops or on a separate dish. 

FRIED PORK CHOPS. 

Fry them the same as mutton chops. If a sausage flavor is hked, sprinkle 
over them a httle powdered sage or smnmer savory, pepper and salt, and if a 
gravy is liked, skim off some of the fat in the pan and stir in a spoonful of flour; 
stir it until free from lumps, then season with pepper and salt and turn in a pint. 
of sweet milk. Boil up and serve in a gravy boat. 

PORK PIE. 
Make a good plain paste. Take from two and a half to three pounds of the 
thick ends of a loin of pork, with very Uttle fat on it; cut into very thin slices 
three inches long by two inches wide; put a layer at the bottom of a pie-dish> 



MEATS. 131 

Wash and chop finely a handful of parsley, also an onion. Sprinkle a smaU 
portion of these over the pork, and a little pepper and salt. Add another layer 
of pork, and over that some more of the seasoning, only be sparing of the nut- 
meg. Continue this till the dish is f all. Now pour into the dish a cupful of 
stock or water, and a spoonful or two of catsup. Put a Uttle paste arovmd the 
edge of the dish; put on the cover, and place the pie in a rather hot oven. When 
the paste has risen and begins to take color, place the pie at the bottom of the 
oven, with some paper over it, as it will require to be baked at least two hours. 
Some prefer to cook the meat imtil partly done, before putting into the crust.

PORK POT-PIE. 

Take pieces of ribs of lean salt pork, also a shce or two of the fat of salt pork; 
scald it well with hot water so as to wash out the briny taste. Put it into a 
kettle and cover it with cold water, enough for the required want. Cover it and 
boil an horn:, season with pepper; then add half a dozen potatoes cut into 
quarters. When it all commences to boU again, drop in dumplings made from 
this recipe: 

One pint of sour or buttermilk, two eggs, well beaten, a teaspoonf ul of salt, 
a level teaspoonf ul of soda; dissolve in a spoonful of water as much flour as wiQ 
make a very stiff batter. Drop this into the kettle or broth by spoonfuls, and 
cook forty minutes, closely covered. 

PORK AND BEANS. (Baked). 
Take two quarts of white beans, pick them over the night before, put to soak 
in cold water; in the morning put them in fresh water and let them scald, then 
turn off the water and put on more, hot; put to cook with them a piece of salt 
pork, gashed, as much as would make five or six slices; boU slowly till soft (not 
mashed), then add a tablespoonftd of molasses, half a teaspoonful of soda, stir 
in well, put in a deep pan, and bake one hour and a half. If you do not like to 
use pork, salt the beans when boiling, and add a lump of butter when preparing 
them for the oven. 

BOSTON PORK AND BEANS. 
Pick over carefully a quart of small, white beans; let them soak over night 
in cold water; in the morning wash and drain in another water. Put on to boil 
in plenty of cold water with a piece of soda the size of a bean; let them come to 
a boil, then drain again, cover with water once more, and boil them fifteen 
minutes, or until the skin of the beans will crack when taken out and blown 



132 MEATS. 

upon. Drain the beans again, put them into an earthen pot, adding a table- 
spoonful of salt; cover with hot water, place in the centre of a pound of salt 
pork, first scalding it with hot water, and scoring the rind across the top, a 
quarter of an inch apart to indicate where the shces are to be cut. Place the 
pot in the oven, and bake six hours or longer. Keep the oven a moderate heat; 
add hot water from the tea-kettle as needed, on account of evaporation, to keep 
the beans moist. When the meat becomes crisp and looks cooked, remove it, as 
too long baking the pork destroys its soUdity. 

FRIED SALT PORK. 
Cut in thin slices, and freshen in cold water, roU in flour, and fry crisp. If 
required quickly, pour boiling water over the slices, let stand a few minutes, 
drain and roU in flour as before; drain off most of the grease from the frying- 
pan; stir in whfle hot one or two tablespoonfuls of flour, about half a pint of 
milk, a httle pepper, and salt if over freshened; let it boil, and pour into a gravy 
dish. A teaspoonful of finely-chopped parsley will add pleasantly to the appear- 
ance of the gravy. 

GRILLED SALT PORK. 

Take quite thin slices of the thick part of side pork, of a clear white, and 
thinly streaked with lean; hold one on a toasting fork before a brisk fire to griU; 
have at hand a dish of cold water, in which immerse it frequently while cook- 
ing, to remove the superfluous fat and render it more deUcate. Put each sUce 
as cooked in a warm covered pan; when aU are done, serve hot. 

FRIED HAM AND EGGS. 

Cut shces of ham quite thin, cut off the rind or skin, put them into a hot 
frying-pan, tmmng them often untfl crisp, taking care not to burn the shces; 
three minutes will cook them well. Dish them on a hot platter; then turn off 
the top of the grease, rinse out the pan, and put back the clear grease to fry the 
eggs. Break the eggs separately in a saucer, that in case a bad one should be 
among them it may not mix with the rest. Shp each egg gently into the frying- 
pan. Do not turn them while they are frying, but keep pouring some of the 
hot lard over them with a kitchen spoon; this vdU do them sufficiently on the 
upper side. They will be done enough in about three minutes; the white must 
retain its transparency so that the yolk wiU be seen through it. When done, 
take them up with a tin shce, drain off the lard, and if any part of the white is 
discolored or ragged, trim it off. Lay a fried egg upon each shce of the ham, 
and send to table hot.

COLD BACON AND EGGS. 

An economical way of using bacon and eggs that have been left from a 
previous meal is to put them in a wooden bowl and chop them quite fine, add- 
ing a Uttle mashed or cold chopped potato, and a Uttle bacon gravy, if any was 
left. Mix and mould it into httle balls, roU iu raw egg and cracker-crumbs, and 
fry in a spider the same as frying eggs; fry a light brown on both sides. Serve 
hot. Very appetizing. 

SCRAPPEL. 

Scrappel is a most palatable dish. Take the head, heart and any lean scraps 
of pork, and boU imtil the flesh slips easily from the bones. Eemove the fat, 
gristle and bones, then chop fine. Set the hquor in which the meat was boiled 
aside until cold, take the cake of fat from the surface and return to the fire. 
When it boils, put in the chopped meat and season well with pepper and salt. 
Let it boil again, then thicken with corn-meal as you would in making ordinary 
corn-meal mush, by letting it sHp through the fingers slowly to prevent lumps. 
Cook an hour, stirring constantly at first, afterwards putting back on the range 
in a position to boil gently. When done, pour into a long, square pan, not too 
deep, and mold. In cold weather this can be kept several weeks. Cut into 
slices when cold, and fried brown, as you do mush, is a cheap and delicious 
breakfast dish. 

TO BAKE A HAM. (Corned.) 

Take a medium-sized ham and place it to soak for ten or twelve hours. Then 
cut away the rusty part from underneath, wipe it dry, and cover it rather thickly 
over with a paste made of flour and water. Put it into an earthen dish, and set 
it in a moderately heated oven. When done, take off the crust carefully, and 
peel off the skin, put a friU of cut paper aroimd the knuckle, and raspings of 
bread over the fat of the ham, or serve it glazed and garnished with cut 
vegetables. It wiU take about four or five hours to bake it. 

Cooked in this way the flavor is much fijier than when boiled. 

PIGS' FEET PICKLED. 
Take twelve pigs' feet, scrape and wash them clean, put them into a sauce- 
pan with enough hot (not boiling) water to cover them. When partly done, salt 
them. It requires four to five hours to boil them soft. Pack them in a stone 
crock, and pour over them spiced vinegar made hot. They wiU be ready to use 
in a day or two. If you wish them for breakfast, spht them, make a batter of 
two eggs, a cup of nulk, salt, a teaspoonful of butter, with flour enough to make 



134 MEATS. 

a thick batter; dip each piece in this and fry in hot lard. Or, dip them in beaten 
egg and flour and fry. Souse is good eaten cold or warm. 

BOILED HAM. 

First remove aU dust and mold, by wiping with a coarse cloth; soak it for an 
hour in cold water, then wash it thoroughly. Cut with a sharp knife the 
hardened surface from the base and butt of the ham. Place it over the fire in 
cold water, and let it come to a moderate boil, keeping it steadily at this point, 
allowing it to cook twenty minutes for every pound of meat. A ham weighing 
twelve pounds will require four hours to cook properly, as underdone ham is very 
unwholesome. When the ham is to be served hot, remove the skin by peeling 
it off, place it on a platter, the fat side up, and dot the surface with spots of 
black pepper. Stick in also some whole cloves. 

If the ham is to be served cold, allow it to remain in the pot until the water 
in which it was cooked becomes cold. This makes it more juicy. Serve it in 
the same manner as when served hot. 

BROILED HAM. 

Cut your ham into thin shces, which should be a httle less than one quarter 
of an inch thick. Trim very closely the skin from the upper side of each sUce, 
and also trim off the outer edge where the smoke has hardened the meat. If the 
ham is very salt lay it in cold water for one hour before cooking, then wipe with 
a dry cloth. Never soak ham in tepid or hot water, as it wUl toughen the meat. 

Broil over a brisk fire, turning the shces constantly. It wiU require about 
five minutes, and should be served the last thing directly from the gridiron, 
placed on a warm platter, with a httle butter and a sprinkle of pepper on the top 
of each shce. If ham or bacon is allowed to stand by the fire after it has been 
broiled or fried, it will speedily toughen, losing all its grateful juices. 

Cold boiled ham is very nice for broiling, and many prefer it to using the raw 
ham. 

POTTED HAM. 

To two pounds of lean ham allow one pound of fat, two teaspoonfuls of 
powdered mace, half a nutmeg, grated, rather more than half a teaspoonful of 
cayenne. 

Mode. — Mince the ham, fat and lean together, in the above proportion, and 
pound it well in a mortar, seasoning it with cayenne pepper, pounded mace and 
nutmeg; put the mixture into a deep baking dish, and bake for half an hour; 
then press it well into a stone jar, fill up the jar with clarified lard, cover it 



MEATS. 135 

closely, and paste over it a piece of thick paper. If weU seasoned, it will keep a 
long time in winter, and will be found very convenient for sandwiches, etc. 

BOLOGNA SAUSAGE. (Cooked.) 

Two pounds of lean pork, two pounds of lean veal, two pounds of fresh 
lean beef, two pounds of fat salt pork, one pound beef suet, ten tablespoonfuls of 
powdered sage, one ounce each of parsley, savory, marjoram and thyme, mixed. 
Two teaspoonfuls of cayenne pepper, the same of black, one grated nutmeg, one 
teaspoonful of cloves, one minced onion, salt to taste. Chop or grind the meat 
and suet; season, and stuff into beef skins; tie these up, prick each in several 
places to allow the escape of steam; put into hot, not boihng water, and heat 
gradually to the boihng point. Cook slowly for one hour; take out the skins 
and lay them to dry in the sun, upon clean, sweet straw or hay. Eub the out- 
side of the skins with oU or melted butter, and place in a cool, dry cellar. If you 
wish to keep them more than a week, rub ginger or pepper on the outside, then 
wash it off before using. This is eaten without further cooking. Cut in roimd 
shoes and lay shced lemon around the edge of the dish, as many like to squeeze 
a few drops upon the sausage before eating. These are very nice smoked like 
hams. 

COUNTRY PORK SAUSAGES. 

Six pounds lean fresh pork, three pounds of chine fat, three tablespoonfuls of 

salt, two of black pepper, four tablespoonfuls of pounded and sifted sage, two 

of summer savory; Chop the lean and fat pork finely, mix the seasoning in with 

your hands, taste to see that it has the right flavor, then put them into cases, 

either the cleaned intestines of the hog, or make long, narrow bags of stout 

muslin, large enough to contain each enough sausage for a family dish. FiU 

these with the meat, dip in melted lard, and hang them in a cool, dry dark place. 

Some prefer to pack the meat in jars, pouring melted lard over it, covering the 

top, to be taken out as wanted and made into small round cakes with the 

hands, then fried brown. Many hke spices added to the seasoning — cloves, 

mace and nutmeg. This is a matter of taste. 

—Marion Harland. 

TO FRY SAUSAGES. 

Put a small piece of lard or butter into the frying-pan. Prick the sausages 

with a fork, lay them in the melted grease, keep moving them about, turning 

them frequently to prevent bursting; in ten or twelve minutes they will be 

sufficiently browned and cooked. Another sure way to prevent the cases from 

bursting is to cover them with cold water and let it come to the boihng point; turn 



136 MEATS. 

off the water and fry them. Sausages are nicely cooked by putting them in a 
baking-pan and browning them in the oven, turning them once or twice. In 
this way you avoid all smoke and disagreeable odor. A pound will cook brown 
in ten minutes in a hot oven. 

HEAD CHEESE. 
Boil the forehead, ears and feet, and nice scraps trimmed from the hams of a 
fresh pig, imtil the meat will almost drop from the bones. Then separate the 
meat from the bones, put it in a large chopping-bowl, and season with pepper, 
salt, sage and summer savory. Chop it rather coarsely; put it back into the 
same kettle it was boiled in, with just enough of the Uquor in which it was boiled 
to prevent its burning; warm it through thoroughly j mixing it well together. 
Now pour it into a strong musUn bag, press the bag between two flat surfaces, 
with a heavy weight on top; when cold and sohd it can be cut in shoes. Good 
cold, or warmed up in vinegar. 

TO CURE HAMS AND BACON. (A Prize Recipe.) 

For each hundred pounds of hams, make a pickle of ten pounds of salt, two 
poimds of brown sugar, two ounces of saltpetre, and one ounce of red pepper, 
and from four to four and a half gallons of water, or just enough to cover the 
hams, after being packed ia a water-tight vessel, or enough salt to make a brine 
to float a fresh egg high enough, that is to say, out of water. First rub the 
hams with common salt, and lay them into a tub. Take the above ingredients, 
put them into a vessel over the flre, and heat it hot, stirring it frequently; 
remove all the scum, allow it to boil ten minutes, let it cool and pour over the 
meat. After laying in this brine five or six weeks, take out, drain and wipe, 
and smoke from two to three weeks. Small pieces of bacon may remain in 
this pickle two weeks, which would be sufficient, 

TO SMOKE HAMS AND FISH AT HOME. 

Take an old hogshead, stop up all the crevices, and fix a place to put a cross- 
stick near the bottom, to hang the articlec to be smoked on. Next, in the side, 
cut a hole near the top, to introduce an iron pan filled with hickory wood sawdust 
and small pieces of green wood. Having turned the hoshead upside down, hang 
the articles upon the cross-stick, introduce the iron pan in the opening, and place 
a piece of red-hot iron in the pan, cover it with sawdust, and all wiU be complete. 
Let a large ham remain ten days, and keep up a good smoke. The best way 
for keeping hams is to sew them in coarse cloths, whitewashed on the outside. 



MEATS. 137 

TO CURE ENGLISH BACON. 

This process is called the " dry cure, " and is considered far preferable to the 
New England or Yankee style of putting prepared brine or pickle over the meat. 
First the hog should not be too large or too fat, weighing not over two hundred 
pounds; then after it is dressed and cooled cut it up into proper pieces; allow to 
every hundred pounds a mixture of foiur quarts of common salt, one quarter of 
a pound of saltpetre and four pounds of sugar. Rub this preparation thoroughly 
over and into each piece, then place them into a tight tub or suitable cask; there 
win a brine form of itself, from the j\iices of the meat, enough at least to baste 
it with, which should be done two or three times a week; turning each piece 
every time. 

In smoking this bacon, the sweetest flavor is derived from black birch chips, 
but if these are not to be had, the next best wood is hickory; the smoking with 
corn-cobs imparts a rank flavor to this bacon, which is very distasteful to English 
people visiting this country. It requires three weeks or a month to smoke this 

bacon properly. 

— Berkshire Recipe. 

TO TRY OUT LARD. 

Skin the leaf lard carefully, cut it into smaU pieces, and put it into a kettle 
or sauce-pan; pour in a cupful of water to prevent burning; set it over the fire 
where it wiU melt slowly. Stir it frequently and let it simmer until nothing 
remains but brown scraps. Eemove the scraps with a perforated skimmer, 
throw in a little salt to settle the fat, and, when clear, strain through a coarse 
cloth into jars. Eemember to watch it constantly, stirring it from the bottom 
until the salt is thrown in to settle it; then set it back on the range until clear. 
If it scorches it gives it a very bad flavor. 



Sauc& anb Bresstnas. 



DRAWN BUTTER 

Melted butter is the foundation of most of the common sauces. Have a 
covered sauce-pan for this purpose. One lined with porcelain wiU be best. Take 
a quarter of a pound of the best fresh butter, cut it up, and mix with it about 
one tablespoonful of flour. When it is thoroughly mixed, put it iato the sauce- 
pan, and add to it half a teacupful of hot water. Cover the sauce-pan and set it 
in a large tin pan of boiling water. Shake it round continually (always moving 
it the same way) till it is entirely melted and begins to simmer. Then let it rest 
tin it boils up. 

If you set it on too hot a fire, it wiU be oUy. 

If the butter and flour are not well mixed, it will be lumpy. 

If you put too much water, it wUl be thin and poor. All these defects are to 
be carefully avoided. 

In melting butter for sweet or pudding sauce, you may use milk instead of 
water 

TARTARE SAUCE. 

The raw yolks of two eggs, half a teacupful of pure olive oil, three tablespoon- 
fuls of vinegar, one of made mustard, one teaspoonful of sugar, a quarter of a tea- 
spoonful of pepper, one teaspoonfid of salt, one of onion juice, one tablespoonful 
of chopped capers, one of chopped cucumber pickle. Put together the same ae 
mayonnaise dressing, adding the chopped ingredients the last thing. 

This sauce is good for fried or boiled fish, boiled tongue, fish salad, and msTi 
be used with &ied and broiled meats. 

EGG SAUCE, OR WHITE SAUCE. 

Mix two tablespoonfuls of sifted flour with half a teacup of warm butter 
Place over the fire a sauce-pan containing a pint of sweet milk and a salt-spooo. 
of salt, and a dash of white pepper; when it reaches the boiling point, add tlie 
butter and flour, stirring briskly untfl it thickens and becomes like cream. Have 
ready three cold, hard-boiled eggs, shced and chopped, add them to the sauce; 
let them heat through thoroughly, and serve in a boat. If you have plenty of 
cream, use it and omit the butter. By omitting the eggs, you have the same as 
"White Sauce." 

OYSTER SAUCE. 

Take a pint of oysters and heat them in their own liquor long enough tc 
come to a boil, or until they begin to ruffle. Skim out the oysters into a warm 



SAUCES AND DRESSINGS. 139 

dish, put into the liquor a teacup of milk or cream, two tablespooufiils of cold 
butter, a pinch of cayenne and salt; thicken with a tablespoonful of flour stirred 
to a paste, boil up and then add the oysters. 

Oyster sauce is used for fish, boUed turkey chickens and boiled white meats 
of most kinds. 

LOBSTER SAUCE. 

Put the coral and spawn of a boiled lobster into a mortar, with a tablespoonful 
of butter; poimd it to a smooth mass, then rub it through a sieve; melt nearly a 
quarter of a povmd of sweet butter, with a wineglass of water or vinegar; add 
a teaspoonful of made mustard, stir in the coral and spawn, and a Uttle salt and 
pepper; stir it imtil it is smooth, and serve. Some of the meat of the lobster 
may be chopped fine, and stirred into it. 

SAUCE FOR SALMON AND OTHER FISH. 
One cupful of milk heated to a boU and thickened with a tablespoonful of 
corn-starch previously wet up with cold water, the liquor from the salmon, one 
great spoonful of butter, one raw egg beaten light, the juice of half a lemon, 
mace and cayenne pepper to taste. Add the egg to thickened milk when you 
have stirred in the butter and hquor; take from the fire, season and let it stand 
in hot water three minutes, covered. Lastly put in lemon juice and turn out 
immediately. Pour it aU over and around the salmon. 

SAUCE FOR BOILED COD. 

To one giU of boiUng water add as much milk; stir into this while boiling 
two tablespoonfuls of butter gradually, oae tablespoonful of flour wet up with 
cold water; as it thickens, the chopped yolk of one boiled egg, and one raw egg 
beaten light. Take directly from the fire, season with pepper, salt, a little 
chopped parsley and the juice of one lemon, and set covered in boiling water 
(but not over fire) five minutes, stirring occasionally. Pour part of the sauce 
over fish when dished; the rest in a boat. Serve mashed potatoes with it. 

FISH SAUCE. No. 2. 
Make a pint of drawn butter, add one tablespoonful of pepper sauce or Wor- 
cestershire sauce, a little salt and six hard-boiled eggs, chopped fine. Pour over 
boiled fish and garnish with sliced lemon. Very nice. 

FISH S^UCE. No. 3. 
"Half a cunful of melted butter, half a cupful of vinegar, two tablespoonfuls 

or tomato catsup, salt, and a tablespoonful of made mustard. Boil ten minutes.

HO SAUCES AND DRESSINGS, 

CELERY SAUCE. 
Mix two tablespoonfuls of flour with half a teacupful of butter; have ready 
a pint of boiling milk; stir the flour and butter into the milk; take three heads 
of Cilery, cut iuto small bits, and boil for a few minutes in water, which strain 
off; put the celery into the melted butter, and keep it stirred over the fire for 
five or ten minutes. This is very nice with boiled fowl or turkey. Another 
way to make celery sauce is: Boil a head of celery until quite tender, then put 
it through a sieve; put the yolk of an egg in a basin, and beat it weU with the 
strained juice of a lemon; add the celery and a couple of spoonfuL° of liquor in 
which the turkey was boiled; salt and pepper to taste. 

CAPER SAUCE. 
Chop the capers a very little, unless quite small; make haK a pint of drawn 
butter, to which add the capers, with a large spoonful of the juice from, the 
bottle in which they are sold; let it just simmer, and serve in a tureen. Nastur- 
tiums much resemble capers in taste, though larger, and may be used, and, in 
fact, are preferred by many. They are grown on a climbing vine, and are culti- 
vated for their blossom and for pickling, When used as capers they should be 
chopped more. If neither capers nor nasturtiums are at hand, some pickles chop- 
ped up form a very good substitute in the sauce. 

BREAD SAUCE. 
One cup of stale bread-crumbs, one onion, two ounces of butter, pepper and 
salt, a little mace. Cut the onion fine, and boil it in milk tiU quite soft; then 
strain the milk on to the stale bread-crumbs, and let it stand an hour. Put it 
in a sauce-pan with the boiled onion, pepper, salt and mace. Give it a boil, and 
serve in sauce tureen. This sauce can also be used for grouse, and is very nice. 
Eoast partridges are nice served with bread-crumbs, fried brown in butter, with 
cranberry or currant jeUy laid beside them in the platter. 

TOMATO SAUCE. 

Take a quart can of tomatoes, put it over the fire in a stew-pan, put in one 
slice of onion, and two cloves, a little pepper and salt; boil about twenty minutes; 
then remove from the fire and strain it through a sieve. Now melt in another 
pan an oimce of butter, and as it melts, sprinkle in a tablespoonful of flour; stir 
it until it browns and froths a little. Mix the tomato pulp with it, and it is 
ready for the table. 

Excellent for mutton chops, roast beef, etc.

— Miss Parloa. 

CURRANT JELLY SAUCE. 

Three tablespoonfuls of butter, one onion, one bay leaf, one sprig of celery, 
two tablespoonfuls of vinegar, half a cupful of currant jelly, one tablespoonful 
of flovir, one pint of stock, salt, pepper. Cook the butter and onion until the 
latter begins to color. Add the flour and herbs. Stir until brown; add the 
stock, and simmer twenty minutes. Strain, and skim off all the fat. Add the 
jeUy, and stir over the fire until it is melted. Serve with game. 

BROWN SAUCE. 

Delicious sauce for meats is made in this way: Slice a large onion, and fry in 

butter till it is brown; then cover the onion with rich brown gravy, which is left 

from roast beef; add mustard, salt and pepper, and if you choose a tablespoonful 

©f "Worcestershire sauce; let this boil up, and if too thick, thin it with a little 



SAUCES AND DRESSINGS. 1 43 

stock or gravy, or even a little hot water with butter. Pour this when done 
through a fine sieve. Of course a larger quantity can be prepared at once than 
is mentioned here. 

MUSHROOM SAUCE. 

Wash a pint of small button mushrooms, remove the stems and outside skins, 
stew them slowly in veal gravy or milk or cream, adding an onion, and season- 
ing with pepper, salt and a little butter roUed in flour. Their flavor wiU be 
heightened by salting a few the night before, to extract the juice. In dressing 
mushrooms, only those of a dull pearl color on the outside and the under part 
tinged with pale pink should be selected. If there is a poisonous one among 
them, the onion in the sauce will tarn black. In such a case throw the whole 
a,way. Used for poultry, beef or fish. 

APPLE SAUCE. 

When you wish to serve apple sauce with meat prepare it in this way: Cook 
the apples until they are very tender, then stir them thoroughly so there wiU be 
no lumps at all; add the sugar and a little gelatine dissolved in warm water, a 
tablespoonful in a pint of sauce; pour the sauce into bowls, and when cold it will 
be stiff like jeUy, and can be turned out on a plate. Cranberry sauce can bo 
treated in the same way. Many prefer this to plain stewing. 

Apples cooked in the following way look very pretty on a tea-table, and are 
appreciated by the palate. Select firm, round greenings; pare neatly and cut in 
halves; place in a shallow stew-pan with sufiicient bofling water to cover them, 
and a cupful of sugar to every six apples. Each half should cook on the bottom 
of the pan, and be removed from the others so as not to injure its shape. Stew 
slowly until the pieces are very tender; remove to a dish carefully; boil the 
syrup half an hour longer; pour it over the apples and eat cold. A few pieces 
of lemon boiled in the syrup adds to the flavor. These sauces are a fine accom- 
paniment to roast pork or roast goose. 

CIDER APPLE SAUCE. 
Boil four quarts of new cider until it is reduced to two quarts, then put into 
it enough pared and quartered apples to fill the kettle; let the whole stew over a 
moderate fire four hours; add cinnamon if hked. This sauce is very fine with 
almost any kind of meat. 

OLD-FASHIONED APPLE SAUCE. 
Pare aud chop a dozen medium-sized apples, put them in a deep pudding-dishj 
sprinkle over them a heaping coffee-cupful of sugar and one of water. Place 



'44 SA UCES AND DRESSINGS. 

them in the oven and bake slowly two hours or more, or until they are a deep 
red brown; quite as nice as preserves. 

CRANBERRY SAUCE. 
One quart of cranberries, two cupfuls of sugar, and a pint of water. Wash 
the cranberries, then put them on the fire with the water, but in a covered sauce- 
pan. Let them simmer until each cranberry bursts open; then remove the cover 
of the sauce-pan, add the sugar and let them aU boil for twenty minutes without 
the cover. The cranberries must never be stirred from the time they are placed 
on the fire. This is an unfailing recipe for a most deUcious preparation of cran- 
berries. Very fine with turkey and game. 

APPLE OMELET. 
Apple omelet, to be served with broiled spare-rib or roast pork, is very deU- 
cate. Take nine large, tart apples, four eggs, one cup of sugar, one tablespoon- 
ful of butter; add cinnamon or other spices to suit your taste; stew the apples 
till they are very soft; mash them so that there will be no lumps; add the butter 
and sugar while they are still warm; but let them cool before putting in the 
beaten eggs; bake this till it is brown; you may put it all in a shallow pudding- 
dish or in two tin plates to bake. Very good. 

FLAVORED VINEGARS. 

Almost all the flavorings used for meats and salads may be prepared in 
vinegar with little trouble and expense, and wHl be found useful to impart an 
acid to flavors when lemons are not at hand. 

Tarragon, sweet basil, bumet, green mint, sage, thyme, sweet-marjoram, 
etc., may be prepared by putting three ounces of either of these herbs, when in 
blossom, into one gallon of sharp vinegar; let stand ten days, strain off clear, and 
bottle for use. 

Celery and cayenne may be prepared, using three ounces of the seed as above. 

CUCUMBER VINEGAR. 

Ingredients. — Ten large cucmnbers, or twelve smaller ones, one quart of 
vinegar, two onions, two shalots, one tablespoonful of salt, two tablespoontols 
of pepper, a quarter of a teaspoonf ul of cayenne. 

JfocZe. — Pare and shce the cucumbers, put them in a stone jar, or wide- 
mouthed bottle, with the vinegar; slice the onions and shalots, and add them, 
with aU the other ingredients, to the cucumbers. Let it stand four or five days; 
boil it aU up, and when cold, strain the liquor through a piece of musHn, and 



SAUCES AND DRESSINGS. 1 45 

store it away in small bottles well sealed. This vinegar is ,* very nice addition to 
gravies, hashes, etc., as well as a great improvement to salads, or to eat with 
cold meat. 

CURRY POWDER. 

To make curry powder, take one ounce of ginger, one ounce of mustard, on» 
oimce of pepper, three ounces of coriander seed, three ounces of turmeric, half 
an ounce of cardamoms, one-quarter ounce of cayenne pepper, one-quarter ounce 
of cinnamon, and one-quarter ovmce of cmnmia seed. Pound all these ingre- 
dients very fine in a mortal-; sift them and cork tight in a bottle. 

This can be had already prepared at most druggists, and it is much less 
trouble to purchase it than to make it at home. 

CURRY SAUCE. 
One tablespoonf ul of butter, one of flour, one teaspoonful of curry powder, 
one large sUce of onion, one large cupful of stock, salt and pepper to taste. Cut 
the onion fine, and fry brown in the butter. Add the flour and curry powder. 
Stir for one minute, add the stock and season with the salt and pepper. Sinmaer 
five minutes; then strain and serve. This sauce can be served with a broil at 
sauU of meat or fish. 

TO BROWN BUTTER. 
Put a lump of butter into a hot frying-pan, and toss it about imtU it browns. 
Stir brown flour into it until it is smooth and begins to boil. Use it for coloring 
gravies, and sauces for meats. 

TO BROWN FLOUR. 

Spread flour upon a tin pie-plate, set it upon the stove or in a very hot oven, 
and stir continually after it begins to color, until it is brown all through. 

Keep it always on hand; put away in glass jars covered closely. It is excel- 
lent for coloring and thickening many dishes. 

TO MAKE MUSTARD. 

Boil some vinegar; take four spoonfuls of mustard, half of a teaspoonful of 
sugar, a salt-spoonful of salt, a tablespoonful of melted butter; mix well. 

FRENCH MUSTARD. 

Three tablespoonf uls of mustard, one tablespoonful of granulated sugar, well 
worked together, then beat in an egg until it is smooth; add one teacupful of 
vinegar, a Uttle at a time, working it all smooth; then set on the stove and cook 



146 SAUCES AND DUESSINGS. 

three or four minutes, stirring all the time; when cool, add one tablespoonful of 

the best oHve oil, taking care to get it aU thoroughly worked in and smooth. 

You will find this very nice. 

— Mrs. D. Riegel. 

KITCHEN PEPPER. 

Mix one ounce of ground ginger, half an ovuice each of black pepper, groimd 

cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice, one teaspoonful of ground cloves, and six 

ounces of salt. Keep in a tightly corked bottle. 

— The Caterer. 

PREPARED COCOANUT (For Pies, Puddings, &c.) 

To prepare cocoanut for future use; first cut a hole through the meat at one 
of the holes in the end, draw off the milk, then loosen the meat by pounding the 
nut well on all sides. Crack the nut and take out the meat, and place the pieces 
of meat in a cool open oven over night, or for a few hours, to dry; then grate it. 
If there is more grated than is needed for present use, sprinkle it with sugar, 
and spread out in a cool dry place. When dry enough put away in dry cans 01 
bottles. Will keep for weeks. 

SPICES. 

Ginger is the root of a shrub first known in Asia, and now cultivated in the 
West Indies and Sierra Leone. The stem grows three or four feet high, and 
dies every year. There are two varieties of ginger — ^the white and black — 
caused by taking more or less care in selecting and preparing the roots, which 
are always dug in winter, when the stems are withered. The white is the best. 

Cinnamon is the inner bark of a beautif vd tree, a native of Ceylon, that grows 
from twenty to thirty feet in height and lives to be centuries old. 

Cloves. — Native to the Molucca Islands, and so called from resemblance to 
a naU (clavis). The East Indians call them " changkek," from the Chinese " te- 
chengMa" (fragrant nails). They grow on a strait, smooth-barked tree, about 
forty feet high. Cloves are not fruits, but blossoms, gathered before they are 
quite unfolded. 

Allspice. — A berry so called because it combines the flavor of several spices 
— grows abundantly oa the allspice or bayberry tree; native of South America 
and the West Indies. A single tree has been known to produce one hundred 
and fifty pounds of berries. They are purple when ripe. 

Black pepper is made by grinding the dried berry of a climbing viae, native 
to the East Indies. White pepper is obtained from the same berries, freed from 



SAUCES AND DUESSINGS. 147 

their husk or rind. Red or cayenne pepper is obtained by grinding the scarlet pod 
or seed-vessel of a tropical plant that is now cultivated in all parts of the world. 
Nutmeg is the kernel of a small, smooth, pear-shaped fruit that grows on a 
tree in the Molucca Islands, and other parts of the East. The trees commence 
bearing in the seventh year, and continue fruitful untU they are seventy or 
eighty years old. Around the nutmeg or kernel is a bright, brown sheU. This 
shell has a soft scarlet covering, which, when flattened out and dried, is known 
as mace. The best nutmegs are sohd, and emit oil when pricked with a pin. 

HERBS FOR WINTER. 

To prepare herbs for winter use, such as sage, summer savory, thyme, mint 
or any of the sweet herbs, they should be gathered fresh iu their season, or 
procm-e them from the market. Examine them well, throwing out all poor 
sprigs; then wash and shake them; tie into small bundles, and tie over the 
bundles a piece of netting or old lace, (to keep off the dust); hang up in a warm, 
dry place, the leaves downward. In a few days the herb will be thoroughly dry 
•and brittle. Or you may place them in a cool oven, and let them remain in it 
until perfectly dry. Then pick off aU the leaves, and the tender tops of the 
stems; put them in a clean, large-mouthed bottle that is perfectly dry. When 
wanted for use, rub fine, and sift through a sieve. It is much better to put 
them in bottles as soon as dried, as long exposure to the air causes them to lose 
strength and flavor. 

MEATS AND THEIR ACCOMPANIMENTS. 

With roast beef: tomato sauce, grated horse-radish, mustard, cranberry sauce, 

pickles. 
With roast pork: apple sauce, cranberry sauce. 
TSTith roast veal: tomato sauce, mushroom sauce, onion sauce and cranberry 

sauce. Horse-radish and lemons are good. 
With roast mutton: currant jelly, caper sauce. 
With boiled mutton: onion sauce, caper sauce. 
With boiled fowls: bread sauce, onion sauce, lemon sauce, cranberry sauce, jellies. 

Also cream sauce. 
With roast lamb: mint sauce. 
With roast turkey: cranberry sauce, currant jelly. 
With boiled turkey: oyster sauce. 
With venison or wild ducks: cranberry sauce, currant jeUy, or currant jelly 

warmed with port wine. 



148 SAUCES AND DUESSINGS. 

With roast goose: apple sauce, cranberry sauce, grape or currant jelly. 
With boiled fresh mackerel: stewed gooseberries. 
With boUed blue fish: white cream sauce, lemon sauce. 
With broiled shad: mushroom sauce, parsley or egg sauce. 
With fresh salmon: green peas, cream sauce. 

Pickles are good with aU roast meats, and in fact are suitable accompaniments 
to aU kinds of meats in general. 

Spinach is the proper accompaniment to veal; green peas to lamb. 

Lemon juice makes a very grateful addition to nearly all the insipid members 
of the fish kingdom. Shoes of lemon cut into very small dice and stirred into 
drawn butter and allowed to come to the boiling point, served with fowls, is a 
fine accompaniment. 

VEGETABLES APPROPRIATE TO DIFFERENT DISHES. 

Potatoes are good with aU meats. With fowls they are nicest mashed. 
Sweet potatoes are most appropriate with roast meats, as also are onions, winter 
squash, cucvunbers and asparagus. 

Carrots, parsnips, turnips, greens and cabbage are generally eaten with 
boiled meat, and com, beets, peas and beans are appropriate to either boiled or 
roasted meat. Mashed turnip is good with roast pork and with boiled meats. 
Tomatoes are good with almost every kind of meats, especially with roasts. 

WARM DISHES FOR BREAKFAST. 

The following of hot breakfast dishes may be of assistance in knowing what 
to provide for the comfortable meal called breakfast. 

Broiled beef steak, broiled chops, broiled chicken, broiled fish, broiled quail

Then numberless varieties of bread can be selected, in form of roUs, fritters, 
mtiffins, waffles, corn-cakes, griddle-cakes, etc., etc. 

For beverages, coffee, chocolate and cocoa, or tea if one prefers it; these are 
aU suitable for the breakfast table. 

When obtainable always have a vase of choice flowers on the breakfast ta- 
ble; also some fresh fruit, if convenient. 



Salabs, 

Everything in the make-up of a salad should be of the freshest material, the 
vegetables crisp and fresh, the oil or butter the very best, meats, fowl and fish 
well cooked, pvire cider or white- wine vinegar — in fact, every ingredient first- 
class, to insure success. 

The vegetables used in salad are: Beet-root, onions, potatoes, cabbage, lettuce, 
celery, cucumbers, lentils, haricots, winter cress, peas, French beans, radish, 
cauliflower, — all these may be used judiciously in salad, if properly seasoned, 
according to the foUowing directions: 

Chervil is a dehcious salad herb, invariably found in all salads prepared by a 
French gourmet. No man can be a true epicure who is unfamiliar with this 
excellent herb. It may be procured from the vegetable stands at Fulton and 
Washington markets the year round. Its leaves resemble parsley, but are more 
divided, and a few of them added to a breakfast salad give a dehghtful flavor. 

Chervil vinegar. — A few drops of this vinegar added to fish sauces or salads 
is excellent, and well repays the Uttle trouble taken in its preparation. Half fill 
a bottle with fresh or dry chervil leaves; fill the bottle with good vinegar and 
heat it gently by placing it in warm water, which bring to boiling point; i-emove 
from the fire; when cool cork, and in two weeks it wfll be ready for use. 

MAYONNAISE DRESSING. 

Put the yolks of foxu" fresh raw eggs, with two hard-boiled ones, into a cold 
bowl. Eub these as smoooth as possible before introducing the oil; a good 
measure of oil is a tablespoonful to each yolk of raw egg. AU the ant consists 
in introducing the oil by degrees, a few drops at a time. You can never make 
a good salad without taking plenty of time. When the oil is well mixed, and 
assumes the appearance of jeUy, put ia two heaping teaspoonfuls of dry table 
salt, one of pepper, and one of made mustard. Never put in salt and pepper 



150 SAUCES AND DRESSINGS— SALADS. 

before this stage of the process, because the salt and pepper wovQd coagulate the 
albumen of the eggs, and you could not get the dressing smooth. Two table- 
spoonfuls of Tinegar added gradually. 

The Mayonnaise should be the thickness of thick cream when finished, but if 
it looks like curdling when mixing it, set in the ice-box or in a cold place for 
about forty minutes or an hour, then mix it again. It is a good idea to place it in 
a pan of cracked ice while mixing. 

For lobster salad, use the coraZ, mashed and pressed through a sieve, then 
add to the above. 

Salad dressing should be kept in a separate bowl in a cold place, and not 
mixed with the salad until the moment it is to be served, or it may lose its 
crispness and freshness. 

DRESSING FOR COLD SLAW. (Cabbage Salad.) 

Beat up two eggs, with two tablespoonfuls of sugar add a piece of butter the 
size of half an egg, a teaspoonful of mustard, a httle pepper, and lastly a teacup 
of vinegar. Put aU these ingredients into a dish over the fire, and cook like a 
soft custard. Some think it improved by adding half a cupful of thick sweet 
cream to this dressing; in that case use less vinegar. Either way is very fine. 

SALAD CREAM DRESSING. No. i. 

One cup fresh cream, one spoonful fine flour, the whites of two eggs beaten 
stiff, three spoonfuls of vinegar, two spoonfuls of salad oil or soft butter, two spoon- 
fuls of powdered sugar, one teaspoonful salt, one half teaspoonful pepper, one 
teaspoonful of made mustard. Heat cream almost to bofling; stir in the flour, 
previously wet with cold milk; boil two minutes, stirring aU the time; add sugar 
and take from fire. When half cold, beat in whipped whites of egg; set aside 
to cool. When quite cold, whip in the oil or butter, pepper, mustard and salt; 
if the salad is ready, add vinegar, and pour at once over it. 

CREAM DRESSING. No. 2. 

Two tablespoonfuls ol whipped sweet cream, two of sugar, and four of vine- 
gar; beat weU and pour over the cabbage, previously cut very fine and seasoned 
with salt 

FRENCH SALAD DRESSING. 

Mix one saltspoon of pepper with one of salt; add three tablespoonfuls of 
ohve oil, and one even tablespoonful of onion, scraped fine; then one tablespoon- 



SA UCES AND DRESSINGS— SALADS. 1 5 1 

ful of vinegar; when well mixed, pour the mixture over your salad, and stir aU 
till well mingled. 

The merit of a salad is that it should be cool, fresh and crisp. For vegetables, 
use only the delicate white stalks of celery, the small heart-leaves of lettuce, or 
tenderest stalks and leaves of the white cabbage. Keep the vegetable portions 
crisp and fresh, until the time for serving, when add the meat. For chicken 
and fish salads, use the Mayonnaise dressing. For simple vegetable salads, the 
French dressing is most appropriate, using onion rather than garlic. 

MIXED SUMMER SALAD. 
Three heads of lettuce, two teaspoonfuls of green mustard leaves; a handful 
of water-cresses; five tender radishes; one cucumber; three hard-boiled eggs; two 
teaspoonfuls of white sugar; one teaspoonf ul of salt; one teaspoonf ul of pepper; 
one teaspoonful of made mustard; one teacupful of vinegar; half a teacupfuJ 
of oil. 

Mix all well together, and serve with a lump of ice in the middle. 

— "Common Sense in the Household." 

CHICKEN SALAD. 

Boil the fowls tender, and remove all the fat, gristle and skin; mince tlvx> 
meat in small pieces, but do not hash it. To one chicken put twice and a half 
its weight in celery, cut in pieces of about one-quarter of an inch; mix thor- 
oughly, and set it in a cool place, — the ice chest. 

In the meantime prepare a " Mayonnaise dressing," and when ready for tht, 
table pour this dressing over the chicken and celery, tossing and mixing it thor- 
oughly. Set it in a cool place vmtU ready to serve. Garnish with celery tips, oi 
cold hard-boiled eggs, lettuce-leaves, from the heart, cold boiled beets or capersj 
ohves. 

Crisp cabbage is a good substitute for celery; when celery is not to be had 
use celery vinegar in the dressing. Turkey makes a fine salad. 

LOBSTER SALAD. No. i. 
Prepare a sauce with the coral of a fine, new lobster, boiled fresh for about 
half an hour. Pormd and rub it smooth, and mix very gradually with a dress- 
ing made from the yolks of two hard-boiled eggs, a tablespoonful of made mus- 
tard, three of salad oU, two of vinegar, one of white powdered sugar, a small 
teaspoonful of salt, as mucJi black pepper, a pinch of cayenne and two fresh 
yolks of eggs. Next fill your salad bowl with some shred lettuce, the better 
part of two, leaving the small curled centre to garnish your dish with. Mingle

with this the flesh of your lobster, torn, broken or cut into bits seasoned with 
salt and pepper and a small portion of the dressing. Pour over the whole the 
rest of the dressing; put your lettuce-hearts down the centre and arrange upon 
thesides slices of hard-boUed eggs. 

LOBSTER SALAD. No. 2, 

Using canned lobsters, take a can, skim off all the oil on the surface, and 
•hop the meat up coarsely on a flat dish. Prepare the same way six heads of 
celery; roix a teaspoonful of mustard into a smooth paste with a Uttle vinegar; 
add two fresh yolks of eggs; a tablespoonful of butter, creamed, a small tea- 
spoonful of salt, the same of pepper, a quarter of a teaspoonful of cayenne 
pepper, a giU of vinegar, and the mashed yolks of two hard-boiled eggs. Mix a 
small portion of the dressing with the celery and meat, and turn the remainder 
over aU. Garnish with the green tops of celery, and a hard-boiled egg, cut into 
thin rings. 

FISH SALAD. 

Take a fresh white fish or trout, boil and chop it, but not too fine; put with 
the same quantity of chopped cabbage, celery or lettuce; season the same as 
ehicken salad. Garnish with the tender leaves of the heart of lettuce. 

OYSTER SALAD. 

Drain the liquor from a quart of fresh oysters. Put them in hot vinegar 
enough to cover them placed over the fire; let them remain xaniil plum'p, but not 
cooked; then drop them immediately in cold water, drain off, and mix with 
them two pickled cucumbers cut fine, also a quart of celery cut in dice pieces, 
some seasoning of salt and pepper. Mix aU well together, tossing up with a 
sUver fork. Pom- over the whole a "Mayonnaise dressing." Garnish with 
celery tips and sUces of hard-boiled eggs arranged tastefully. 

DUTCH SALAD.

and bone one herring, and cut it up into small pieces; cut up into dice an equal 
quantity of Bologna or Lyons sausage, or of smoked ham and sausages; also, 
an equal quantity of the breast of cold roast fowl, or veal; add likewise, always 
in the same quantity, and cut into'dice, beet-roots, pickled cucumbers, cold boiled 
potatoes cut in larger dice, and in quantity according to taste, but at least thrice

mix all the ingredients weU. together, reserving the olives and anchovies to orna- 
ment the top of the bov^^l; beat up together oil and Tarragon vinegar with white 
pepper and French mustard to taste; pour this over the salad and serve. 

HAM SALAD. 

Take cold boiled ham, fat and lean together, chop it until it is thoroughly 
mixed, and the pieces are about the size of peas; then add to this an equal quan- 
tity of celeiT" cut fine; if celery is out of season, lettuce may be substituted. 
Line a dish thickly with lettuce-leaves and fill with the chopped ham and celery. 
Make a dressing the same as for cold slaw and turn over the whole. Very 
fine. 

CRAB SALAD. 

Boil three dozen hard-shell crabs twenty-five minutes; drain and let them 
cool gradually; remove the upper shell and the tail, break the remainder apart 
and pick out the meat carefully. The large claws should not be forgotten, for 
they contain a dainty morsel, and the creamy fat attached to the upper shell 
should not be overlooked. Line a salad-bowl with the small white leaves of two 
heads of lettuce, add the crab meat, pour over it a Mayonnaise garnish with 
crab claws, hard-boiled eggs, and Uttle mounds of cress-leaves, which may be 
mixed vnth the salad when served. 

COLD SLAW. 
Select the finest head of bleached cabbage — that is to say, one of the finest 
and most compact of the more deUcate varieties; cut up enough into shreds to 
fill a large vegetable-dish or salad-bowl — that to be regulated by the size of the 
cabbage and the quantity required; shave very fine, and after that chop up, the 
more thoroughly the better. Put this into a dish in which it is to be served, 
after seasoning it well with salt and pepper. Turn over it a dressing made as 
for cold slaw; mix it weU, and garnish vnth shces of hard-boiled eggs. 

PLAIN COLD SLAW. 
Shce cabbage very fine; season with salt, pepper and a httle sugar; pour 
over vinegar and mix thoroughly. It is nice served in the centre of a platter 
with fried oysters around it. 

HOT SLAW. 
Cut the cabbage as for cold slaw; put it into a stew-pan, and set it on the top 
of the stove for half an hour, or tiU hot all through; do not let it boil. Then 
make a dressing the same as for cold slaw, and, while hot, povir it over the hot

cabbage. Stir it until well mixed and the cabbage looks coddled. Serve imme- 
diately. 

TOMATO SALAD. 

Peel and slice twelve good, sound, fresh tomatoes; the slices about a quarter 
of an inch thick. Set them on the ice or in a refrigerator while you make th& 
dressing. Make the same as "Mayonnaise," or you may use "Cream dress- 
ing." Take one head of the broad-leaved variety of lettuce, wash, and arrange 
them neatly around the sides of a salad bowl. Place the cold, shced tomatoes in 
the centre. Pour over the dressing and serve. 

ENDIVE. 
This ought to be nicely blanched and crisp, and is the most wholesome of aU 
salads. Take two, cut away the root, remove the dark-green leaves, and pick 
off all the rest; wash and drain well, add a few chives. Dress with Mayonnaise^ 
dressing. 

Endive is extensively cultivated for the adulteration of coffee; is also a fine 
reUsh, and has broad leaves. Endive is of the same nature as chiccory, the- 
leaves being curly. 

CELERY SALAD. 

Prepare the dressing the same as for tomato salad; cut the celery into bits 
half an inch long, and season. Serve at once before the vinegar injures the 
crispness of the vegetable. 

LETTUCE SALAD. 

Take the yolks of three hard-boiled eggs, and salt and mustard to taste j 
mash it fine; make a paste by adding a dessertspoonful of oUve oil or melted 
butter (use butter always when it is difficult to get fresh oil); mix thoroughly, 
and then dilute by adding gradually a teacupf ul of vinegar, and pour over the 
lettuce. Garnish by slicing another egg and laying over the lettuce. This is 
sufficient for a moderate-sized dish of lettuce. 

POTATO SALAD, HOT. 

Pare six or eight large potatoes, and boil till done, and shce thin while hot; 
peel and cut up three large onions, into small bits and mix vpith the potatoes; 
cut up some breakfast bacon into small bits, sufficient to fiU a teacup; and fry it 
a light brown; remove the meat, and into the grease stir three tablespoonfuls of 
vinegar, making a soin- gravy, which with the bacon pour over the potato and 
onion; mix lightly. To be eaten when hot.

POTATO SALAD, COLD. 

Chop cold boiled potatoes tine, with enough raw onions to season nicely; 
make a dressing as for lettuce salad, and pour over it. 

BEAN SALAD. 

String young beans; break into half -inch pieces or leave whole; wash and 
cook soft in salt water; drain weU; add finely chopped onions, pepper, salt and 
▼inegar; when cool, add ohve oU or melted butter. 

TO DRESS CUCUMBERS RAW. 

They should be as fresh from the vine as possible, few vegetables being more 
unwholesome when long gathered. As soon as they are brought in, lay them in 
cold water. Just before they are to go to table take them out, pare them and 
shoe them into a pan of fresh cold water. When they are all sUced, transfer 
them to a deep dish; season them with a Uttle salt and black pepper, and pour 
over them some of the best vinegar. You may mix with them a small quantity 
of shced onions, not to be eaten, but to communicate a slight flavor of onion to 
the vinegar. 

CELERY UNDRESSED. 

Celery is sometimes sent to the table without dressing. Scrape the outside 
stalks, and cut off the green tops and the roots; lay it in cold water untU near 
the time to serve, then change the water, in which let it stand three or four 
minutes; split the stalks in three, with a sharp knife, being careful not to break 
them, and serve in goblet-shaped salad glasses. 

To crisp celery, let it he in ice- water two hours before serving; to fringe the 
stalks, stick several coarse needles into a cork, and draw the stalk half way from 
the top through the needles several times and lay in the refrigerator to curl and 
crisp. 

RADISHES. 

AU the varieties are generally served in the same manner, by scraping and 
placing on the table in glasses containing some cold water to keep them fresh 
looking. 

PEPPERGRASS AND CRESS. 

These are used mostly as an appetizer, served simply with salt. Cresses are 
oecasionaUy used in making salad.

HORSE-RADISH. 

Horse-radish is an agreeable relish, and has a particularly fresh taste in the 
spring; is scraped fine or grated, and set on the table in a small covered cup; 
■much that is bottled and sold as horse-radish is adulterated with grated tvumip. 

LETTUCE. 

Wash each leaf separately, breaking them from the head; crisp in ice- water 
and serve the leaves whole, to be prepared at table, providing hard-boiled eggs 
cut in halves or shoes, oil and other ingredients, to be mixed at table to individual 
taste.

pickles. 

Pickles should never be put into vessels of brass, copper or tin, as the action 
of the acid on such metals often results in poisoning the pickles. Porcelain or 
granite- ware is the best for such purposes. 

Vinegar that is used for pickling should be the best cider or white- wine, and 
should never be boiled more than five or six minutes, as it reduces its strength. 
In putting away pickles, use stone or glass jars; the glazing on common earthen- 
ware is rendered injurious by the action of the vinegar. When the jar is nearly 
filled with the pickles, the vinegar should completely cover them, and if there 
is any appearance of their not doing well, turn off the vinegar, cover with fresh 
vinegar, and spices. Alum in small quantities is useful in making them firm 
and crisp. In using ground spices, tie them up in muslin bags. 

To green pickles, put green grape-vine leaves or green cabbage leaves 
between them when heating. Another way is to heat them in strong ginger 
tea. Pickles should be kept closely covered, put into glass jars and sealed 
tightly. 

" Turmeric " is India saffron, and is used very much in pickling as a coloring. 

A piece of horse-radish put into a jar of pickles wiU keep the vinegar from 
losing its strength, and the pickles will keep soimd much longer, especially 
tomato pickles. 

CUCUMBER PICKLES. 

Select the medium, small-sized cucumbers. For one bushel make a brine that 
win bear up an egg; heat it boihng hot and pom- it over the cucumbers; let them 
stand twenty-four hours, then wipe them dry; heat some vinegar boiling hot, 
wnd pour over them, standing again twenty-fovu- hours. Now change the vine-

gar, putting on fresh vinegar, adding one quart of brown sugar, a pint of white 
mustard seed, a small handful of whole cloves, the same of cimiamon sticks, a 
piece of alum the size of an egg, half a cup of celery seed; heat it all boiling hot 
and pour over the cucumbers. 

SLICED CUCUMBER PICKLE. 

Take one gallon of medium-sized cucumbers, put them into a jar or padl. 
Put into enough hoiling water to cover them a small handful of salt, turn it over 
them and cover closely; repeat this three mornings, and the fomth morning 
scald enough cider vinegar to cover them, putting into it a piece of alum as 
large as a walnut, a teacup of horse-radish root cut up fine; then tie up in a small 
muslin bag, one teaspoonful of mustard, one of groimd cloves, and one of cinna- 
mon. Slice up the cuciunbers half of an inch thick, place them in glass jars 
and pour the scalding vinegar over them. Seal tight and they will keep good a 

year or more.

CUCUMBER PICKLES. (For Winter Use.) 

A good way to put down cucumbers, a few at a time: 

When gathered from the vines, wash, and put in a firkin or haK barrel 
layers of cucumbers and rock-salt alternately, enough salt to inake sufficient 
brine to cover them, no water; cover with a cloth; keep them under the brine 
with a heavy board; take off the cloth, and rinse it every time you put in fresh 
cucumbers, as a scum wiU rise and settle upon it. Use plenty of salt and it will 
keep a year. To prepare pickles for use, soak in hot water, and keep in a warm 
place until they are fresh enough, then pour spiced vinegar over them and let 
them stand over night, then pom- that off and put on fresh. 

GREEN TOMATO PICKLES. (Sweet.) 

One peck of green tomatoes, sKced the day before you are ready for pickling, 
sprinkling them through and through with salt, not too heavily; in the morning 
drain off the liquor that wiU drain from them. Have a dozen good-sized onions 
rather coarsely shced; take a suitable kettle and put in a layer of the sliced 
tomatoes, then of onions, and between each layer sprinkle the following spices: 
Sis: red peppers chopped coarsely, one cup of sugar, one tablespoonful of ground 
allspice, one tablespoonful of ground cinnamon, a teaspoonful of cloves, one 
tftblespoonf ul of mustard. Turn over three pints of good vinegar, or enough te 
completely cover them; boil until tender. This is a choice recipe. 



SA UCES AND DRESSINGS— PICKLES. 1 6 1 

If the flavor of onions is objectionable, the pickle is equally as good without 
them. 

GREEN TOMATO PICKLES. (Sour.) 
Wash and sUce, without peehng, one peck of sound green tomatoes, put 
them into a jar in layers with a sUght sprinkling of salt between. This may be 
done over night; in the morning draiu off the liquor that has accumulated. 
Have two dozen medium-sized onions peeled and sUced, also six red peppers 
chopped fine. Make some spiced vinegar by boiling for half an hour a quart of 
cider vinegar with whole spices in it. Now take a porcelain kettle and place in it 
some of the sUced tomatoes, then some of the sUced onions; shake in some black 
pepper and some of the chopped red peppers; pour over some of the spiced vine- 
gar; then repeat with the tomatoes, onions, etc., until the kettle is fuU; cover 
with cold, pure, cider vinegar, and cook until tender, but not too soft. Tiurn into 
a jar weU-covered, and set in a cool place. 

PICKLED MUSHROOMS. 
Sufficient vinegar to cover the mushrooms; to each quart of mushrooms two 
blades pounded mace, one ounce ground pepper, salt to taste. Choose some nice 
young button-mushrooms for pickliag, and rub off the skin with a piece of 
flannel and salt, and cut off the stalks; if very large, take out the red inside, 
and reject the black ones, as they are too old. Put them ia a stew-pan, sprinkle 
salt over them, with pounded mace and pepper in the above proportion; shake 
them weU over a clear fire until the liquor flows, and keep them there until it is 
aU dried up agaiu; then add as much vinegar as will cover them; just let it 
simmer for one minute, and store it away in stone jars for use. When cold, tie 
down with bladder, and keep in a dry place; they will remain good for a length 
of time, and are generally considered excellent for flavoring stews and other 
dishes. 

PICKLED CABBAGE. (Purple.) 

Cut a sound cabbage into quarters, spread it on a large flat platter or dish 
and sprinkle thickly with salt; set it in a cool place for twenty-four hours; then 
drain off the brine, wipe it dry and lay it in the sun two hours, and cover with 
cold vinegar for twelve hours. Prepare a pickle by seasoning enough vinegar 
to cover the cabbage with equal quantities of mace, allspice, cinnamon and black 
pepper, a cup of sugar to every gallon of vinegar, and a teaspoonful of celery 
seed to every pint. Pack the cabbage in a stone jar; boil the vinegar and spices 
five minutes and pour on hot. Cover and set away in a cool, dry place. It will be 
good in a month, A few slices of beet-root improves the color.

PICKLED WHITE CABBAGE. 

This recipe recommends itself as of a delightful flavor, yet easily made, and 
a convenient substitute for the old-fashioned, tedious method of pickling the 
same vegetable. Take a peck of quartered cabbage, put a layer of cabbage and 
one of salt, let it remain over night; in the morning squeeze them and put them 
on the fire, witti four chopped onions covered with vinegar; boil for half an 
hour, then add one ounce of turmeric, one gill of black pepper, one gill of celery 
seed, a few cloves, one tablespoonf ul of allspice, a few pieces of ginger, half an 
ounce of mace, and two pounds of brown sugar. Let it boU half an hoiu- longer, 
and when cold it is fit for use. Four tablespoonfuls of made mustard should be 
added with the other ingredients. 

PICKLED CAULIFLOWER. 

Break the heads into small pieces, and boil ten or fifteen minutes in salt and 
■w^ater; remove from the water and drain carefully. When cold, place in a jar, 
and pour over it hot vinegar, in which has been scalded a hberal supply of whole 
cloves, pepper, allspice and white mustard. Tie the spices in a bag, and, on 
removing the vinegar from the fire, stir into each quart of it two teaspoonfuls 
of IVench mustard, and half a cup of white sugar. Cover tightly and be sure 
to have the vinegar cover the pickle. 

PICKLED GREEN PEPPERS. 

Tate two dozen large, green, bell peppers, extract the seeds by cutting a slit 
in the ^ide (so as to leave them whole). Make a strong brine and pour over 
them; let them stand twenty-four hours. Take them out of the brine, and soak 
them in water for a day and a night; now turn off this water and scald some 
vinegar, in which put a small piece of alum, and pour over them, letting them 
stand three days. Prepare a stuffing of two hard heads of white cabbage, 
chopped fine, seasoned slightly with salt and a cup of white mustard seed; mix 
it well and stvifE the peppers hard and full; stitch up, place them in a stone jar, 
and pour over spiced vinegar scalding hot. Cover tightly. 

GREEN PEPPER MANGOES. 

Select firm, sound, green peppers, and add a few red ones, as they are orna- 
mental and look well upon the table. With a sharp knife remove the top, take 
out the seed, soak over night in salt water, then fill with chopped cabbage and 
greep tomatoes, seasoned with salt, mustard seed and ground cloves. Sew on

CHOWCHOW. (Superior English R-dpe.) 
This excellent pickle is seldom made at home, as we can get the imported 
article so much better than it can be made from the usual recipes. This we 
vouch for as being as near the genuine article as can be made: One quart of 
young, tiny cucumbers, not over two inches long, two quarts of very small white 
onions, two quarts of tender string beans, each one cut in halves, three quarts of 
green tomatoes, sUced and chopped very coarsely, two fresh heads of cauliflower, 
cut into small pieces, or two heads of white, hard cabbage. 

After preparing these articles, put them in a stone jar, mix them together, 
sprinkling salt between them sparingly. Let them stand twenty-four horn's, 
then drain off all the brine that has accumulated. Now put these vegetables in 
a preserving kettle over the fire, sprinkling through them an oimce of turmeric 
for coloring, six red peppers, chopped coarsely, four tablespoonfuls of mustard 
seed, two of celery seed, two of whole allspice, two of whole cloves, a coffee cup 
of sugar, and two-thirds of a teacup of best ground mixed mustard. Pour on 
enough of the best cider vinegar to cover the whole weU; cover tightly and 
simmer aU weU until it is cooked aU through and seems tender, watching and 
stirring it often. Put in bottles or glass jars. It grows better as it grows 
older, especially if sealed when hot. 

PICKLED ONIONS. 
Peel small onions until they are white. Scald them in salt and water until 
tender, then take them up, put them into wide-mouthed bottles, and pour over 
them hot spiced vinegar; when cold, cork them close. Keep in a dry, dark 
place. A tablespoonful of sweet oil may be put in the bottles before the cork. 
The best sort of onions for pickling are the small white buttons. 

PICKLED MANGOES. 
Let the mangoes, or young musk-melons, lie in salt water strong enough t« 
bear an egg, for two weeks; then soak them in piu-e water for two days, chang- 
ing the water two or three tinies; then remove the seeds and put the mangoes 
in a kettle, first a layer of grape leaves, then mangoes, and so on until aU are in, 
covering the top with leaves; add a lump of alum the size of a hickory nut; 
pour vinegar over them and boil them ten or fifteen minutes; remove the leaves 
and let the pickles stand in this vinegar for a week; then stuff them with the fol- 
lowing mixttu-e: One pound of ginger soaked in brine for a day or two, and cut

half a pound of garlic, soaked for a day or two in brine, and then dried; one 
pint grated horse-radish, one of black mustard seed and one of white mustard 
seed; bruise aU the spices and mix with a teacup of pure oUve oil; to each 
mango add one teaspoonful of brown sugar; cut one soM head of cabbage fine; 
add one pint of small onions, a few small cucumbers and green tomatoes; lay 
them in brine a day and a night, then drain them well and add the imperfect 
mangoes chopped fine and the spices; mix thoroughly, stuff the mangoes and tie 
them; put them in a stone jar and pour over them the best cider vinegar; set 
them in a bright, dry place until they are canned. In a month add three 
poimds of brown sugar; if this is not sufficient, add more imtil agreeable to 
taste. This is for foiu" dozen mangoes. 

PICKLE OF RIPE CUCUMBERS. 

This is a French recipe, and is the most excellent of all the high-flavored 
condiments; it is made by sun-drying thirty old, full-grown cucumbers, which 
have first been pared and spht, had the seeds taken out, been salted, and let 
stand twenty-fom- hours. The sun should be permitted to dry, not simply drain 
them. When they are moderately dry, wash them with vinegar, and place 
them in layers in a jar, alternating them with a layer of horse-radish, mustard 
seed, garlic, and onions, for each layer of cucumbers. Boil in one quart of vine- 
gar, one ounce of race-ginger, half an ounce of allspice, and the same of turmeric; 
when cool pour this over the cuciunbers, tie up tightly, and set away. This pickle 
requires several months to mature it, but is dehcious when old, keeps admira- 
bly, and only a little is needed as a rehsh. 

PICKLED OYSTERS. 

One gallon of oysters; wash them well in their own liquor; carefully clear 
away the particles of shell, then put them into a kettle, strain the liquor over 
them, add salt to your taste, let them just come to the boiling point, or until the 
edges curl up; then skim them out and lay in a dish to cool; put a sprig of mace 
and a httle cold pepper; and allow the hquor to boil some time, skimming it 
now and then so long as any scum rises. Pour it into a pan and let it cool. 
When perfectly cool, add a half pint of strong vinegar, place the oysters in a jar 
and pom- the hquor over them.

them closely in a jar. 

PICCALILI. 

One peck of green tomatoes; eight large onions, chopped fine, with one cup

hquor. Now take two quarts of water and* one of vinegar, boU aU together 
twenty minutes. Drain all through a sieve or colander. Put it back into the 
kettle again; turn over it two quarts of vinegar, one pound of sugar, half a 
pound of white mustard seed, two tablespoonfuls of ground pepper, two of cin- 
namon, one of cloves, two of ginger, one of allspice, and half a teaspoonful of 
cayenne pepper. BoU all together fifteen minutes, or until tender. Stir it often 
to prevent scorching. Seal in glass jars. 

A most delicious accompaniment for any kind of meat or fish. 

— Mrs. Si. Johns. 

PICKLED EGGS. 

Pickled eggs are very easUy prepared and most excellent as an accompani- 
ment for cold meats. BoU quite hard three dozen eggs, drop in cold water and 
remove the shells, and pack them when entirely cold in a wide-mouthed jar, 
large enough to let them in or out without breaking. Take as much vinegar as 
you think wiU cover them entirely, and boU in it white pepper, aUspice, a httle 
root-ginger; pack them in stone or wide-mouthed glass jars, occasionaUy putting 
in a tablespoonful of white and black mustard seed mixed, a small piece of race 
ginger, garhc, if liked, horse-radish ungrated, whole cloves, and a very little 
allspice. Slice two or three green peppers, and add in very smaU quantities. 
They wUl be fit for use in eight or ten days. 

AN ORNAMENTAL PICKLE. 

BoU fresh eggs half an hour, then put them in cold water. BoU red beets 
untU tender, peel and cut in dice form, and cover with vinegar, spiced; sheU the 
eggs and drop into the pickle jar. 

EAST INDIA PICKLE. 

Lay in strong brine for two weeks, or untU convenient to use them, small 

cucumbers, very small common white onions, snap beans, gherkins, hard white 

cabbage quartered, plums, peaches, pears, lemons, green tomatoes and anything 

else you may wish. When ready, take them out of the brine and simmer in 



1 66 SAUCES AND DRESSINGS— PICKLES. 

pvire water ttatil tender enough to stick a straw through — ^if still too salt, soak 
in clear water; drain thoroughly and lay them in vinegar in which is dissolved 
one ounce of turmeric to the gallon. For five gallons of pickle, take two ounces 
o£ mace, two of cloves, two of cinnamon, two of allspice, two of celery seed, a 
quaj:ter of a pound of white race ginger, cracked fine, half a poimd of white 
mustard seed, half a pint of smaU. red peppers, quarter of a pound of grated 
horse-radish, half a pint of flour mustard, two ounces of turmeric, half a pint of 
garlic, if you like; soak in two gallons of cider vinegar for two weeks, stirring 
daily. After the pickles have lain in the turmeric vinegar for a week, take them 
out and put in jars or casks, one layer of pickle and one of spice out of the vine- 
gar, till all is used. If the turmeric vinegar is still good and strong, add it and 
the spiced vinegar. If the turmeric vinegar be much diluted, do not use it, but 
add enough fresh to the spiced to cover the pickles; put it on the fire with a 
pound of brown sugar to each gallon; when boiling, pour over the pickle. Eepeat 
this two or three times as your taste may dii-ect. 

MIXED PICKLES. 
Scald in salt water until tender, cauhflower heads, small onions, peppers, 
cucumbers cut in dice, nasturtivuns and green beans; then drain until dry, and 
pack into wide-mouthed bottles. Boil in each pint of cider vinegar one table- 
spoonful of sugar, half a teaspoonful of salt and two tablespoonfuls of mustard; 
pour over the pickle and seal carefully. Other spices may be added if liked. 

BLUE-BERRY PICKLES. 

For blue-berry pickles, old jars which have lost their covers, or whose edges 
have been broken so that the covers will not fit tightly, serve an excellent pur- 
pose, as these pickles mnsl not be kept air-tight. 

Pick over your berries, using only sound ones; fill your jars or wide-mouthed 
bottles to within an inch of the top, then pour in molasses enough to settle 
down into all the spaces; this cannot be done in a moment, as molasses does not 
run very freely. Only lazy people will feel obUged to stand by and watch its 
progress. As it settles, pour in more until the berries are covered. Then tie 
over the top a piece of cotton cloth to keep the fiies and other insects out, and set 
away in the preserve closet. Cheap molasses is good enojigh, and your pickles 
will soon be " sharp." Wild grapes may be pickled in the same manner. 

PICKLED BUTTERNUTS AND WALNUTS. 
These nuts are in the best state for pickling when the outside shell can be 
|9enetrated by the head of a pia. Scald them, and rub off the outside skin, put 



SA UCES AND BRESSINGS—FJCKLES. 167 

them in a strong brine for six days, changing the water every other day, keep- 
ing them closely covered from the air. Then drain and wipe them, (pierciug 
each nut through in several places with a large needle,) and prepare the pickle 
as follows : — For a hundred large nuts, take of black pepper and ginger root each 
an ounce ; and of cloves, mace and nutmeg each a half ounce. Pound all the 
spices to powder, and mix them well together, adding two large spoonfuls of 
mustard seed. Put the nuts into jars, (having first stuck each of them through 
in several places with a large needle,) strewing the powdered seasoning between 
every layer of nuts. Boil for five minutes a gallon of the very best cider vine- 
gar, and pom* it boiling hot upon the nuts. Secm-e the jars closely with corks. 
Tou may begin to eat the nuts in a fortnight. 

WATERMELON PICKLE. 

Ten pounds of watermelon rind boUed in pure water until tender; drain the 
water off, and make a syrup of two pounds of white sugar, one quart of vinegar, 
half an ounce of cloves, one ounce of cinnamon. The syrup to be poured over 
the rind boiling hot three days in succession. 

SWEET PICKLE FOR FRUIT. 

Most of the recipes for making a sweet pickle for fruit, such as cling-stone 
peaches, damsons, plums, cherries, apricots, etc., are so similar, that we give that 
which is the most successfully used. 

To every quart of fruit, allow a cup of white sugar and a large pint of good 
cider vinegar, adding half an ounce of stick cinnamon, one tablespoonful of 
wliole cloves, the same of whole allspice. Let it come to a boil, and pour it hot 
over the fruit; repeat this two or three days in succession; then seal hot in glass 
jars if you wish to keep it for a long time 

The fruit, not the liquor, is to be eaten, and used the same as any pickle, 
bome confound this with " Spiced Fruit," which is not treated the same, one 
being a pickle, the other a spiced preserve boiled down thick. 

Damsons and plums should be pricked with a needle, and peaches washed 
with a weak lye, and then rubbed with a coarse cloth to remove the fur. 

PEAR PICKLE. 

Select small, sound ones, remove the blossom end, stick them with a fork, 
allow to each quart of pears one pint of cider vinegar and one cup of sugar, put 
in a teaspoonful allspice, cinnamon and cloves to boU with the vinegar ; then 
add the pears and boU, and seal in jars. 



i68 SAUCES AND DRESSINGS— PICKLES. 

SPICED CURRANTS. 

Seven pounds of fruit, four pounds of sugar, one pint of good cider vinegar, 
one tablespoonful of groiind cinnamon, one teaspoonful of cloves. Put into a 
kettle and boil until the fruit is soft; then skim out the fruit, putting it on dishes 
until the syrup is boUed down thick. Turn the fruit back into the syrup again, 
so as to heat it all through; then seal it hot in glass jars, and set it in a cool, dark 
fdace. 

Any tart fruit may be put up in this way, and is considered a very good 
embellishment for cold meats. 

SPICED PLUMS. 

Seven pounds of plums, one pint of cider vinegar, four pounds of sugar, two 
tablespoonfuls of broken cinnamon bark, half as much of whole cloves and the 
same of broken nutmeg; place these in a musUn bag and simmer them in a httle 
vinegar and water for half an hour; then add it aU to the vinegar and sugar, and 
bring to a boU; add the plums, and boil carefvilly until they are cooked tender. 
Before cooking the plums they should be pierced with a darning needle several 
times; this wOl prevent the skins bursting while cooking. 

SPICED GRAPES. 

Take the pulp from the grapes, preserving the skins. Boil the pulp and rub 
through a colander to get out the seeds; then add the skins to the strained pulp 
and boil with the sugar, vinegar and spices. To every seven pounds of grapes 
use four and one-half pounds of sugar, one pint of good vinegar. Spice quite 
highly with ground cloves and allspice, with a httle cinnamon. 

PICKLED CHERRIES. 

Select sound, large cherries, as large as you can get them; to every quart of 
cherries allow a large cupful of vinegar, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, a dozen 
whole cloves, and half a dozen blades of mace; put the vinegar and sugar on to 
heat with the spices; boU five minutes, turn out into a covered stoneware vessel; 
cover and let it get perfectly cold; pack the cherries into jars, and pour the vine- 
gar over them when cold; cork tightly and set away; they are fit for use almost 
immediately. 




Vegetables of all kinds should be thoroughly picked over, throwing out all 
decayed or xmripe parts, then well washed ia several waters. Most vegetables, 
when peeled, are better when laid in cold water a short time before cooking. 
When partly cooked a Uttle salt should be thrown into the water in which they 
are boiled, and they should cook steadily after they are put on, not allowed to 
stop boOing or simmering until they are thoroughly done. Every sort of 
culinary vegetable is much better when freshly gathered and cooked as soon as 
possible, and, when done, thoroughly draiued, and served immediately while hot. 

Onions, cabbage, carrots and turnips should be cooked in a great deal of 
water, boiled only long enough to sufficiently cook them, and immediately 
drained. Longer boiUng makes them iusipid in taste, and with too Uttle water 
they turn a dark color. 

Potatoes rank first in importance ia the vegetable line, and consequently 
should be properly served. It requires some Uttle iuteUigence to cook even so 
simple and common a dish as boUed potatoes. In the first place, all defective or 
green ones should be cast out; a bad one wUl flavor a whole dish. If they are 
not uniform in size, they should be made so by cutting after they are peeled. 
The best part of a potato, or the most nutritious, is next to the skin, therefore 
they should be pared very thinly, if at aU; then, if old, the cores should be cut 
out, thrown into cold water salted a Uttle, and boiled until soft enough for a fork 
to pierce through easily; drain immediately, and replace the kettle on the fire 
with the cover partly removed, until they are completely dried. New potatoes 
should be put into boiUng water, and when partly done salted a Uttle. They 
should be prepared just in time for cooking, by scraping off the thin outside 
skin. They require about twenty minutes to boil. 

TO BOIL NEW POTATOES. 

i)o not have the potatoes dug long before they are dressed, as they are never 
good when they have been out of the ground some time. WeU wash them, rub 



1 70 VEGETABLES. 

off tlie skins with a coarse cloth, and put them in boiling water salted. Let 
them boil until tender; try them with a fork, and when done pour the water 
away from them; let them stand by the side of the fire with the hd of the 
sauce-pan partially removed, and when the potatoes are thoroughly dry, put 
them in a hot vegetable dish, with a piece of butter the size of a walnut; pile the 
potatoes over this, and serve. If the potatoes are too old to have the skins rubbed 
off, boil them ia their jackets; drain, peel and serve them as above, with a piece 
of butter placed in the midst of them. They require twenty to thirty minutes 
to cook. Serve them hot and plain, or \\ath melted butter over them. 

MASHED POTATOES. 

Take the quantity needed, pare off the skins, and lay them in cold water half 
an hour; then put them into a sauce-pan, with a little salt; cover with water and 
boU them until done. Drain off the water and mash them fine with a potato- 
masher. Have ready a piece of butter the size of an egg, melted in half a cup 
of boOing hot milk, and a good pinch of salt; mix it well with the mashed 
potatoes until they are a smooth paste, taking care that they are not too wet. 
Put them into a vegetable dish, heap them up and smooth over the top, put a 
small piece of butter on the top in the centre, and have dots of pepper here and 
there on the surface as large as a half dime. 

Some prefer using a heavy fork or wire-beater, instead of a potato-masher, 
beating the potatoes quite Ught, and heaping them up in the dish without 
smoothing over the top. 

BROWNED POTATOES. 

Mash them the same as the above, put them into a dish that they are to be 
served in, smooth over the top, and brush over with the yolk of an egg, or spread 
on a bountiful supply of butter and dust well with floxir. Set in the oven to 
brown; it will brown in fifteen minutes with a quick fire. 

MASHED POTATOES, (Warmed Over.) 

To two cupfuls of cold mashed potatoes, add a half cupful of milk, a pinch of 
salt, a tablespoonful of butter, two tablespoonfuls of flour, and two eggs beaten 
to a froth. Mix the whole until thoroughly light; then put into a pudding or 
vegetable dish, spread a httle butter over the top, and bake a golden brown. 
The quality depends upon very thoroughly beating the eggs before adding them, 
so that the potato wiU remain Kght and porous after baking, similar to sponge- 
cake.

POTATO PUFFS. 

Prepare the potatoes as directed for mashed potato. While hat, shape in 
balls about the size of an egg. Have a tin sheet well buttered, and place the 
balls on it. As soon as aU are done, brush over with beaten egg. Brown in 
the oven. When done, shp a knife under them and slide them upon a hot 
platter. Garnish with parsley, and serve immediately. 

POTATOES A LA CRfeME. 

Heat a cupful of milk; stir in a heaping tablespoonful of butter cut up in as 
much flour. Stir until smooth and thick; pepper and salt, and add two cupfuls 
of cold boiled potatoes, sliced, and a little very finely chopped parsley. Shako 
over the fire until the potatoes are hot all through, and pour into a deep dish, 

NEW POTATOES AND CREAM. 

Wash and rub new potatoes with a coarse cloth or scrubbing-brush; drop 
into boiling water and boil briskly until done, and no more; press a potato 
against the side of the kettle with a fork; if done, it wiU yield to a gentle 
pressure; in a sauce-pan have ready some butter and cream, hot, but not boil- 
ing, a little green parsley, pepper and salt; drain the potatoes, add the mixtiire, 
put over hot water for a minute or two, and serve. 

SARATOGA CHIPS. 

Peel good-sized potatoes, and slice them as evenly as possible. Drop them into 
ice- water; have a kettle of very hot lard, as for cakes; put a few at a time into a 
towel and shake, to dry the moisture out of them, and then drop them into the 
boiling lard. Stir them occasionally, and when of a hght brown take them out 
with a skimmer, and they wiU be crisp and not greasy. Sprinkle salt over them 
while hot. 

FRIED RAW POTATOES. 

Peel half a dozen medium-sized potatoes very evenly, cut them in slices as 
thin as an egg-shell, and be sure to cut them from the breadth, not the length, 
of the potato. Put a tablespoonful each of butter and sweet lard into the 
frying-pan, and as soon as it boils add the sliced potatoes, sprinkling over them 
salt and pepper to season them. Cover them with a tight-fitting lid, and let the 
steam partly cook them; then remove it, and let them fry a bright gold color, 
shaking and turning them carefuUy, so as to brown equally. Serve very hot.

Fried, cold, cooked potatoes may be fried by the same recipe, only slice them 
a little thicker, 

RemarTc. — Boiled or steamed potatoes chopped up or sUced while they are 
yet warm never fry so successfully as when cold. 

SCALLOPED POTATOES, (Kentucky Style.) 

Peel and shce raw potatoes thin, the same as for frying. Butter an earthen 
dish, put in a layer of potatoes, and season with salt, pepper, butter, a bit of 
onion chopped fine, if hked; sprinkle a little flomr. Now put another layer of 
potatoes and the seasoning. Continue in this way tO the dish is filled. Just 
before putting into the oven, pour a quart of hot milk over. Bake three quarters 
of an hour. 

Cold boiled potatoes may be cooked the same. It requires less time to bake 
them; they are delicious either way. If the onion is disliked, it can be omitted. 

STEAMED POTATOES. 

This mode of cooking potatoes is now much in vogue, particularly where 
they are wanted on a large scale, it being so very convenient. Pare the potatoes, 
throw them into cold water as they are peeled, then put them in a steamer. 
Place the steamer over a sauce-pan of boiling water, and steam the potatoes 
from twenty to forty minutes, according to the size and sort. When the fork 
goes easily through them, they are done; then take them up, dish, and serve 
veiy quickly. 

POTATO SNOW. 

Choose some mealy potatoes that wiU boU exceedingly white; pare them, and 
cook them well, but not so as to be watery; drain them, and mash and season 
them well. Put in the sauce-pan in which they were dressed, so as to keep 
them as hot as possible; then press them through a wire sieve into the dish in 
which they are to be served; strew a httle fine salt upon them previous to send- 
ing them to table. French cooks also add a small quantity of pounded loaf 
sugar while they are being mashed. 

HASTY COOKED POTATOES. 

Wash and peel some potatoes; cut them tuto slices of about a quarter of an 
inch in thickness; throw them into boiling salted water, and, if of good quality, 
they wiU be done in about ten minutea. 

Strain off the water, put the potatoes into a hot dish, chop them slightly, add 
pepoer, salt, and a few small pieces of fresh butter, and serve without loss of time.

FAVORITE WARMED POTATOES. 

The potatoes should be boiled whole with the, skins on iii plenty of water, well 
salted, and are much better for being boiled the day before needed. Care should 
be taken that they ai-e not over cooked. Strip off the skins (not pare them with 
a knife), and shce them nearly a quarter of an inch thick. Place them in a 
chopping-bowl and sprinkle over them sufficient salt and pepper to season them 
well; chop them aU one way, then turn the chopping-bowl half way around, 
and chop across them, cutting them into Uttle square pieces, the shape of dice. 
About twenty-five minutes before serving time, place on the stove a sauce-pan 
(or any suitable dish) containing a piece of butter the size of an egg; when it 
begins to melt and run over the bottom of the dish, put in a cup of rich sweet 
milk . When this boils up, put in the chopped potatoes; there should be about 
a quart of them; stir them a Uttle so that they become moistened through with 
the milk; then cover and place them on the back of the stove, or in a moderate 
oven, where they will heat through gradually. When heated through stir care- 
fully from the bottom with a spoon, and cover tightly again. Keep hot until 
ready to serve. Baked potatoes are very good warmed in this manner. 

CRISP POTATOES. 

Cut cold raw potatoes into shavings, cubes, or any small shape; throw them, 
a few at a time, into boiling fat, and toss them about with a knife until they, 
are a uniform hght brown; drain and season with salt and pepper. Fat is never 
hot enough while bubbling — when it is ready it is stiU and smoking, but should 
never bum. 

LYONNAISE POTATOES. 

Take eight or ten good-sized cold boiled potatoes, sUce them endwise, then 

crosswise, making them like dice in small squares. When you are ready to cook 

them, heat some butter or good drippings in a frying-pan; fry in it one small 

onion (chopped fine) imtil it begins to change color, and look yellow. Now put 

in your potatoes, sprinkle well with salt and pepper, stir well and cook about 

five minutes, taking care that you do not break them. They must not hrown. 

Just before taking up, stir in a tablespoonful of minced parsley. Drain dry by 

shaking in a heated colander. Serve very hot. 

— Delmonico. 

POTATO FILLETS. 

Pare and slice the potatoes thin; cut them if you like in small fillets, about a 
quarter of an inch square, and as long as the potato wiU admit; keep them in 



1 74 VEGETABLES. 

cold water until wanted, then drop them into boilii^ lard; when nearly done, 
take them out with a skimmer and draia them, boil up the lard again, drop the 
potatoes back and fry tiU done; this operation causes the fillets to swell up 
andpufif. 

POTATO CROQUETTES. No. i. 

Wash, peel and put four large potatoes in cold water, with a pinch of salt, 
and set them over a brisk fire; when they are done pomr off aU the water and 
mash them. Take another sauce-pan, and put in it ten tablespoonfuls of milk 
and a lump of butter half the size of an egg; put it over a brisk fire; as soon as 
the mUk comes to a boil, poiu" the potatoes into it, and stir them very fast with 
a wooden spoon; when thoroughly mixed, take them from the fire and put them 
on a dish. Take a tablespoonful and roU it in a clean towel, making it oval in 
shape; dip it in a weU-beaten egg, and then in bread crumbs, and drop it in hot 
drippings or lard. Proceed in this manner till aU the potato is used, four 
potatoes making six croquettes. Fry them a hght brown aU over, turning them 
gently as may be necessary. When they are done, lay them on brown paper or 
a hair sieve, to drain aU fat off; then serve on a napkin. 

POTATO CROQUETTES. No. 2. 

Take two cups of cold mashed potato, season with a pinch of salt, pepper 

and a tablespoonful of butter. Beat up the whites of two eggs, and work all 

together thoroughly; make it into small balls slightly flattened, dip them in the 

beaten yolks of the eggs, then roll either in flour or cracker-crumbs; fry the 

same as fish-baUs. 

— Delmonico's. 

POTATOES A LA DELMONICO. 

Cut the potatoes with a vegetable cutter into smaU balls about the size of a 
marble; put them into a stew-pan with plenty of butter, and a good sprinkling 
of salt; keep the sauce-pan covered, and shake occasionally imtil they ana ^mte 
done, which wiU be in about an hour. 

FRIED POTATOES WITH EGGS. 

Slice cold boiled potatoes, and fry in good butter until brown; beat up one or 
two eggs, and stir into them just as you dish them for the table; do not leave 
them a moment on the fire after the eggs are in, for if they harden they are not 
half so nice; one egg is enough for three or four persons, unless they are very 
fond of potatoes; if they are, have plenty, and put in two.

BAKED POTATOES. 

Potatoes are either baked in their jackets or peeled; in either case they should 
not be exposed to a fierce heat, which is wasteful, inasmuch as thereby a great 
deal of vegetable is scorched and rendered uneatable. They should be fre- 
quently turned while being baked, and kept from touching each other in the 
oven or dish. When done in their skias, be particular to wash and brush them 
before baking them. If convenient, they may be baked in wood-ashes, or in a 
Dutch oven in front of the fire. When pared they should be baked in a dish, 
and fat of some kind added to prevent their outsides from becoming burnt; they 
are ordinarily baked tiius as an accessory to baked meat. 

Never serve potatoes, boUed or baked whole, in a closely covered dish. They 
become sodden and clamimy. Cover with a folded napkin that allows the steam 
to escape, or absorbs the moisture. They shoiild be served promptly when done, 
and require about three-quarters of an hom- to one hour to bake them, if of a 
good size. 

BROWNED POTATOES WITH A ROAST. No. i. 

About three quarters of an hour before taking up your roasts, peel middhng- 
jized potatoes, boil them until partly done, then arrange them in the roasting- 
pan aroimd the roast, basting them with the drippings at the same time you do 
the meat, browning then evenly. Serve hot with the meat. Many cooks partly 
^il the potatoes before putting around the roast. New potatoes are very good 
eooked around a roast. 

BROWNED POTATOES WITH A ROAST. No. 2. 

Peel, cook and mash the required quantity, adding while hot a little chopped 
onion, pepper and salt ; form it into small oval balls and dredge them with flour; 
ihen place around the meat, about twenty minutes before it is taken from the 
oven. When nicely browned, drain dry and serve hot with the meat. 

SWEET POTATOES. 

Boiled, steamed and baked the same as Irish potatoes; generally cooked with 
fcheir jackets on. Cold sweet potatoes may be cut in shces across or lengthwise, 
and fried as common potatoes; or may be cut in half and served cold. 

Boiled sweet potatoes are very nice. Boil untU partly done, peel theaa and 
bake brown, basting them with butter or beef drippings several times. Served 
hot. They should be a nice brown.

BAKED SWEET POTATOES. 

Wash and scrape them, split them lengthwise. Steam or boil them until 
nearly done. Drain, and put them in a baking-dish, placing over them lumps 
of butter, pepper and salt; sprinkle thickly with sugar, and bake in the oven to 
a nice brown. 

Hubbard squash is nice cooked in the same manner. 

ONIONS BOILED. 

The white silver-skins are the best species. To boU them peel off the outside, 
cut off the ends, put them into cold water and into a stew-pan, and let them scald 
two minutes; then turn off that water, pour on cold water, salted a httle, and 
boU slowly tin tender, which will be in thirty or forty minutes, according to their 
size; when done drain them quite dry, pour a little melted butter over them, 
sprinkle them with pepper and salt and serve hot. 

An excellent way to peel onions so as not to affect the eyes is to take a pan 
full of water, and hold and peel them under the water. 

ONIONS STEWED. 

Cook the Si*me as boiled onions, and when quite done turn off all the water; 
add a teacupful of milk, a piece of butter the size of an egg, pepper and salt to 
taste, a tablespoonful of flour stirred to a cream; let all boU up once and serve in 
a vegetable dish, hot. 

ONIONS BAKED. 

Use the large Spanish onion, as best for this pmpose; wash them clean, but 
do not peel, and put into a sauce-pan, with sUghtly salted water; boil an hour, 
replacing the water with more boiling hot as it evaporates; t\im off the water, 
and lay the onions on a cloth to dry them well; roll each one in a piece of but- 
tered tissue paper, twisting it at the top to keep it on, and bake in a slow oven 
about an hoiir, or until tender all through; peel them; place in a deep dish, and 
brown sUghtly, basting well with butter for fifteen minutes; season with salt 
and pepper, and pour some melted butter over them. 

FRIED ONIONS. 

Peel, sUce, and fry them brown in equal quantities of butter and lard or nice 
drippings; cover until partly soft, remove the cover and brown them: salt and 
pepper.

SCALLOPED ONIONS. 

Take eight or ten onions of good size, slice them, and boil until tender. Lay 
them in a baking-dish, put in bread-crumbs, butter in small bits, pepper and salt, 
between each layer until the dish is fiiQ, putting bread-crumbs last; add milk or 
cream until full. Bake twenty minutes or half an hour 

A Uttle onion is not an injurious article of food, as many beUeve. A judicious 
use of plants of the onion family is quite as important a factor in successful 
cookery as salt and pepper. When carefully concealed by manipulation in food, 
it affords zest and enjoyment to many who could not otherwise taste of it were 
its presence known. A great many successful compounds derive their excellence 
from the partly concealed flavor of the onion, which imparts a delicate appetiz- 
ing aroma highly prized by epicures. 

CAULIFLOWER. 

When cleaned and washed, drop them into boiling water, into which you 
hare put salt and a teaspoonful of flour, or a shce of bread; boil tiU tender; take 
off, drain, and dish them; serve with a sauce spread over, and made with melted 
butter, salt, pepper, grated nutmeg, chopped parsley, and vinegar. 

Another way is to make a white sauce (see Sauces), and when the cauli- 
flowers are dished as above, turn the white sauce over, and serve warm. They 
may also be served in the same way with a milk, cream, or tomato sauce, <»■ 
with brown butter. 

It is a very good plan to loosen the leaves of a head of cauliflower, and let he, 
the top downward in a pan of cold salt water, to remove any insects that might 
be hidden between them. 

FRIED CAULIFLOWER. 

Bon the cauhflowers tfll about half done. Mix two tablespoonfuls of flour 
with two yolks of eggs, .then add water enough to make a rather thin paste; 
add salt to taste; the two whites are beaten tfll stiff, and then mixed with the 
yolks, flour and water. Dip each branch of the cauliflowers into the mixture, 
and fry them in hot fat. When done, take them off with a skimmer, turn iato 
a colander, dust salt all over, and serve warm. Asparagus, celery, egg-plant, 
oyster plant are all fine when fried in this manner. 

CABBAGE, BOILED. 

Great care is requisite in cleaning a cabbage for boiling, as it frequently 
harbors numerous insects. The large drum-head cabbage requires an hour t« 



1 78 VEGETABLES 

boil; the green savory cabbage will boU in twenty minutes. Add considerable 
salt to the water when boiling. Do not let a cabbage boil too long, — by a long 
boiling it becomes watery. Eemove it from the water into a colander to drain, 
and serve with drawn butter, or butter poured over it. 

Eed cabbage is used for slaw, as is also the white winter cabbage. For direc- 
tions to prepare these varieties, see articles Slaw and Sour-Crout. 

CABBAGE WITH CREAM. 

Remove the outer leaves from a sohd, smaU-sized head of cabbage, and cut 
the remainder as fine as for slaw. Have on the fire a spider or deep skillet, and 
when it is hot put in the cut cabbage, pouring over it right away a pint of boil- 
ing water. Cover closely, and allow it to cook rapidly for ten minutes. Drain 
off the water, and add half a pint of new milk, or part milk and cream; when 
it boils, stir in a large teaspoonful of either wheat or rice flour, moistened with 
milk; add salt and pepper, and as soon as it comes to a boil, serve. Those who 
find slaw and other dishes prepared from cabbage iadigestible, wiU not complain 
of this. 

STEAMED CABBAGE. 

Take a sound, sohd cabbage, and with a large sharp knife shave it very finely. 
Put it in a sauce-pan, pour in haK a teacupful of water or just enough to keep 
it from burning; cover it very tightly, so as to confine the steam; watch it 
closely, add a httle water now and then, until it begins to be tender; then put 
into it a large tablespoonful of butter; salt and pepper to taste, dish it hot. If 
you prefer to give it a tart taste, just before taking from the fire add a third of 
a cup of good vinegar. 

LADIES' CABBAGE. 
Boil a firm white cabbage fifteen minutes, changing the water then for more 
from the boiling tea-kettle. When tender, drain and set aside until perfectly 
cold. Chop fine and add two beaten eggs, a tablespoonful of butter, pepper, 
salt, three tablespoonfuls of rich milk or cream. Stir all weU together, and bake 
in a buttered pudding-dish until brown. Serve very hot. This dish resembles 
cauliflower and is very digestible and palatable. 

FRIED CABBAGE. 
Place m a frying-pan an ounce of butter and heat it boiling hot. Then 
take cold boiled cabbage chopped fine, or cabbage hot, cooked the same as 
steamed cabbage, put it into the hot butter and fry a light brown, adding two 
tablespoonfuls of vinegar. "Very good.

FRENCH WAY OF COOKING CABBAGE. 
Chop cold boiled white cabbage and let it drain till perfectly dry; stir in some 
melted butter to taste; pepper, salt and four table^oonfuls of cream; after it is 
heated through add two weU-beaten eggs; then turn the mixture into a buttered 
frying-pan, stirring imtil it is very hot and becomes a dehcate brown on the 
tmder side. Place a hot dish over the pan, which must be reversed when turned 
out to be served. 

SOUR-CROUT. 

Barrels having held wine or vinegar are used to prepare sour-crout in. It is 
better, however, to have a special barrel for the purpose. Strasburg, as well as 
aU Alsace, has a well-acquired fame for preparing the cabbages. They shce very 
white and firm cabbages in fine shreds with a machine made for the purpose. 
At the bottom of a small barrel they place a layer of coarse salt, and alternately 
layers of cabbage and salt, being careful to have one of salt on the top. As each 
layer of cabbage is added, it must be pressed down by a large and heavy pestle, 
and fresh layers are added as soon as the juice fioats on the surface. The cab- 
bage must be seasoned with a few grains of coriander, juniper berries, etc. 
When the barrel is fuU it must be put in a dry cellar, covered with a cloth, 
tmder a p'ank, and on this heavy weights are placed. At the end of a few days 
it will begin to ferment, during which time the pickle must be drawn off and 
replaced by fresh, imtil the liquor becomes clear. This should be done every 
day. Eenew the cloth and wash the cover, put the weights back, and let stand 
for a month. By that time the sour-crout will be ready for use. Care must 
be taken to let the least possible air enter the sour-crout, and to have the cover 
perfectly clean. Each time the barrel has to be opened it must be properly 
closed again. These precautions must not be neglected. 

Tins is often fried in the same manner as fried cabbage, excepting it is first 
boiled until soft in just water enough to cook it, then fry and add vinegar. 

TO BOIL RICE. 
Pick over the rice carefully, wash it in warm water, rubbing it between the 
hands, rinsing it in several waters, then let it remain in cold water imtil ready 
to be cooked. Have a sauce-pan of water sUghtly salted; when it is boiling 
hard, pour off the cold water from the rice, and sprinkle it in the boiling water 
by degrees, so as to keep the particles separated. Boil it steadily for twenty 
minutes, then take it off from the fire, and drain off aU the water. Place the 
sauce-pan with the hd partly off, on the back part of the stove, where it is only 



l8o VEGETABLES. 

moderately waim, to allow' the rice to dry. The moisture wiU pass off and each 
gToin of rice wiU be separated, so that if shaken the grains AviU fall apart. This 
is the true way of serving rice as a vegetable, and is the mode of cooking it in 
the southern States where it is raised. 

PARSNIPS, BOILED. 

Wash, scrape and spUt them. Put them into a pot of boiling water; add a 
little salt, and boil them tiU quite tender, which wiU be in from two to three 
ho\irs according to their size. Dry them in a cloth when done and pour melted 
butter or white sauce (see Sauces) over them in the dish. Serve them up with 
any sort of boiled meat or with salt cod. 

Parsnips are very good baked or stewed with meat. 

FRIED PARSNIPS. 

Boil tender in a little hot water salted; scrape, cut into long shces, dredge 
with flour ; fry in hot lard or dripping, or in butter and lard mixed; fry quite 
brown. Drain off fat and serve. 

Parsnips may be boiled and mashed the same as potatoes. 

STEWED PARSNIPS. 

After washing and scraping the parsnips shce them about half of an inch 
thick. Put them in a sauce-pan of boihng water containing just enough to 
barely cook them; add a tablespoonful of butter, season with salt and pepper, then 
cover closely. Stew them until the water has cooked away, watching carefuUy 
and stirring often to prevent burning, vmtil they are soft. When they are done 
they wiU be of a creamy Ught straw color and deUciously sweet, retaining all the 
goodness of the vegetable. 

PARSNIP FRITTERS. 

Boil four or five parsnips; when tender take off the skin and mash them fine; 
add to them a teaspoonful of wheat fiour and a beaten egg; put a tablespoonful 
of lard or beef drippings in a frying-pan over the fire, add to it a saltspoonf ul of 
salt; when boiling hot put in the parsnips; make it in small cakes with a spoon; 
when one side is a delicate brown turn the other; when both are done take them 
on a dish, put a very httle of the fat iu which they were fried over and serve hot. 
These resemble very nearly the taste of the salsify or oyster plant, and wHl gen- 
erally be preferred. 

CREAMED PARSNIPS. 
Boil tender, scrape, and shce lengthwise. Put over the fire with two table- 
gpoonfuls of butter, pepper and salt, and a Uttle minced parsley. Shake unti] 



VEGETABLES. i8l 

the mixture boils. Dish the parsnips, add to the sauce three tablespoonfuls of 
cream or milk, ia which has been stirred a quarter of a spoonful of flour. Boil 
once, and pour over the parsnips. 

STEWED TOMATOES. 
Pour boiling water over a dozen sound ripe tomatoes; let them remain for a 
few moments; then peel off the skins, sUce them, and put them over the 
fire in a weU-Uned tin or granite ware sauce-pan. Stew them about 
twenty minutes, then add a tablespoonful of butter, salt and pepper to 
taste; let them stew fifteen minutes longer; and serve hot. Some prefer to 
thicken tomatoes with a Uttle grated bread, adding a teaspoonful of sugar; and 
others who like the flavor of onion chop up one and add whQe stewing; then 
again some add as much green com as there are tomatoes. 

TO PEEL TOMATOES. 

Put the tomatoes into a frying-basket, and plunge them into hot water for 
three or four minutes. Drain and peel. Another way is to place them in a flat 
baking-tin and set them in a 1 ot oven about five minutes; this loosens the skins 
so that they readily slip off. 

SCALLOPED TOMATOES. 

Butter the sides and bottom of a pudding -dish. Put a layer of bread-crumbs 
in the bottom; on them put a layer of sliced tomatoes; sprinkle with salt, pepper 
and some bits of butter, and a very little white sugar. Then repeat with another 
layer of crumbs, another of tomato, and seasoning until full, having the top layer 
of slices of tomato, with bits of butter oh each. Bake covered until weU cooked 
through; remove the cover and brown quickly. 

STUFFED BAKED TOMATOES. 

From the blossom-end of a dozen tomatoes— smooth, ripe and solid — cut a 
thin sUce, and with a small spoon scoop out the pvdp without breaking the rind 
surrounding it; chop a small head of cabbage and a good -sized onion finely, 
and mix with them fine bread-crumbs and the pulp; season with pepper, salt 
and sugar, and add a cup of sweet cream; when all is well mixed, fill the 
tomato shells, replace the slices, and place the tomatoes in a buttered baking 
dish, cut ends up, and put in the pan just enough water to keep from burning; 
drop a small Imnp of butter on each tomato, and bake half an hour or so, till well 
done; place another bit of butter on each, and serve in same dish. Very fine. 

Another stuffing which is considered quite fine. Out a sUce from the stem

of each and scoop out the soft pulp. Mince one small onion and fry it slightly i 
add a gill of hot water, the tomato pulp, and two ounces of cold veal or chicken 
chopped fine, simmer slowly, and season with salt and pepper. Stir into the 
pan cracker-dust or bread-crumbs enough to absorb the moisture; take off from 
the fire and let it cool; stuff the tomatoes with this mass, sprinkle dry crumbs 
over the top; add a small piece of butter to the top of each and bake untU slightly 
browned on top. 

BAKED TOMATOES, (Plain.) 

Peel and slice quarter of an inch thick ; place in layers in a pudding dish, 
seasoning each layer with salt, pepper, butter, and a very little white sugar. 
Cover with a Md or large plate, and bake half an hour. Eemove the hd and 
brown for fifteen minutes. Just before taking from the oven, pour over the 
top three or f o\ir tablespoonf uls of whipped cream, with melted butter. 

TO PREPARE TOMATOES, (Raw.) 

Carefully remove the peeUngs. Only perfectly ripe tomatoes should ever be 
eaten raw, and if ripe the skins easily peel off. Scalding injures the flavor. 
Shce thin, and sprinkle generously with salt, more sparingly with black pepper, 
and to a dish holding one quart, add a light tablespoonful of sugar to give a 
piquant zest to the whole. Lastly, add a gill of best cider vinegar; although, if 
you would have a dish yet better suited to please an epicurean palate, you may 
add a teaspoonful of made mustard and two tablespoonf uls of rich sweet cream. 

FRIED AND BROILED TOMATOES. 

Cut firm, large, ripe tomatoes into thick shoes, rather more than a quarter of 
an inch thick. Season with salt and pepper, dredge weU with flour, or roU in 
egg and crumbs, and fry them brown on both sides evenly, in hot butter and 
lard mixed. Or, prepare them the same as for frying, broiling on a well- 
greased gridiron, seasoning afterward the same as beefsteak. A good accom- 
paniment to steak. Or, having prepared the following sauce, a pint of milk, a 
tablespoonful of flour and one beaten egg, salt, pepper and a very httle mace; 
cream an ounce of butter, whisk into it the milk and let it simmer until it 
thickens; pour the sauce on a hot side-dish and arrange the tomatoes in the 
centre. 

SCRAMBLED TOMATOES. 

Eemove the skins from a dozen tomatoes; cut them up in a sauce-pan; add a 
little buttei, pepper and salt; when sufficiently boiled, beat up five or six eggs. 



VEGETABLES. 183 

and just before you serve turn them into the sauce-pan with the tomatoes, and 
stir one way for two minutes, allowing them time to be done thoroughly. 

CUCUMBER A LA CRtME. 
Peel and cut into sUces (lengthwise) some fine cucumbers. Boil them until 
soft, salt to taste, and serve with delicate cream sauce. 

For Tomato Salad, see " Salads," also for Eaw Cucumbers. 

FRIED CUCUMBERS. 
Pare them and cut lengthwise in very thick slices; wipe them dry with a 
cloth; sprinkle with salt and pepper, dredge with floiu-, and fry in lard and 
butter, a tablespoonful of each, mixed. Brown both sides and serve warm. 

GREEN CORN, BOILED. 

This should be cooked on the same day it is gathered; it loses its sweetness 
in a few hours and must be artificially supphed. Strip off the husks, pick out 
all the silk and put it in boiling water ; if not entirely fresh, add a tablespoonful 
of sugar to the water, but no salt; boil twenty minutes, fast, and serve; or you 
may cut it from the cob, put in plenty of butter and a little salt, and serve in a 
covered vegetable dish. The com is much sweeter when cooked with the husks 
on, but reqtures longer time to boil. WOl generally boil in twenty minutes. 

Green com left over from dinner makes a nice breakfast dish, prepared* as 
follows: Cut the com from the cob, and put into a bowl with a cup of mUk to 
every cup of corn, a half cup of flour, one egg, a pinch of salt, and a httle butter. 
Mix well into a thick batter, and fry in small cakes in very hot butter. Serve 
with plenty of butter and powdered sugar. 

CORN PUDDING. 

This is a Virginia dish. Scrape the substance out of twelve ears of tender, 
green, uncooked corn (it is better scraped than grated, as you do not get those 
husky particles which you cannot avoid with a grater); add yolks and whites, 
beaten separately, of four eggs, a teaspoonful of sugar, the same of flour mixed 
in a tablespoonful of butter, a small quantity of salt and pepper, and one pint of 
milk. Bake about half or three quarters of an hour. 

STEWED CORN. 
Take a dozen ears of green sweet com, very tender and juicy; cut off the 
kernels, cutting with a large sharp knife from the top of the cob down; then 
scrape the cob. Put the com iato a sauce-pan over the fire, with just enough 



1 84 VEGETABLES. 

water to make it cook without burning; boil about twenty minutes, then add a 
teacupful of milk or cream, atablespoonful of cold butter, and season with pepper 
and salt. BoU ten minutes longer, and dish up hot, in a vegetable dish. The 
com woiild be much sweeter if the scraped cobs were boiled first in the water 
that the com is cooked in. 

Many like corn cooked in this manner, putting half com and half tomatoes; 
either way is very good. 

FRIED CORN. 

Cut the com off the cob, taking care not to bring off any of the husk with 
it, and to have the grains as separate as possible. Fry in a httle butter — just 
enough to keep it from sticking to the pan; stir very often. When nicely 
browned, add salt and pepper, and a httle rich cream. Do not set it near the 
stove after the cream is added, as it will be apt to turn. This makes a nice 
dinner or breakfast dish. 

ROASTED GREEN CORN. 

Strip off aU the husk from green com, and roast it on a gridiron over a bright 
fire of coals, turning it as one side is done. Or, if a wood fire is used, make a 
place clean in front of the fire, lay the corn down, turn it when one side is done; 
serve with salt and butter 

SUCCOTASH. 

Take a pint of fresh shelled Lima beans, or any large fresh beans, put them 
in a pot with cold water, rather more than will cover them. Scrape the kernels 
from twelve ears of young sweet com; put the cobs in vsdth the beans, boiling 
from half to three-quarters of an horn:. Now take out the cobs and put in the 
scraped corn; boU again fifteen minutes, then season with salt and pepper to 
taste, a piece of butter the size of an egg, and half a cup of cream. Serve hot. 

FRIED EGG-PLANT. 

Take fresh, pmple egg-plants of a middling size; cut them in slices a quarter 
©f an inch thick, and soak them for half an hour in cold water, with a teaspoon- 
ful of salt in it. Have ready some cracker or bread-crumbs and one beaten egg; 
drain off the water from the slices, lay them on a napkin, dip them in the 
crumbs and then in the egg, put another coat of crumbs on them, and fry them 
in butter to a hght brown. The frying-pan must be hot before the slices are put 
in, — they will fry in ten minutes. 

You may pare them before you put them into the frying-pan^ or you may 



VEGETABLES. 185 

pull the skins off when you take them up. You must not remove them from 
the water until you are ready to cook them, as the air will turn them black. 

STUFFED EGG-PLANT. 

Cut the egg-plant in two; scrape out all the inside and put it in a sauce-pan 
with a little minced ham; cover with water and boil until soft; drain off the 
water; add two tablespoonfuls of grated crumbs, a tablespoonful of butter, half 
a minced onion, salt and pepper; stuff each half of the huU with the mixtm-e; 
add a small lump of butter to each, and bake fifteen minutes 

Minced veal or chicken in the place of ham, is equally as good, and many 
prefer it. 

STRING BEANS. 

Break off the end that grew to the vine, drawing off at the same time the 
string upon the edge; repeat the same process from the other end; cut them 
with a sharp knife into pieces half an inch long, and boil them in just enough 
water to cov&r them. They usually require one hour's boOing; but this depends 
upon their age and freshness. After they have boiled until tender, and the 
water boiled nearly out, add pepper and salt, a tablespoonful of butter, and a 
half a cup of cream; if you have not the cream, add more butter. 

Many prefer to drain them before adding the seasoning; in that case they 
lose the real goodness of the vegetable. 

LIMA AND KIDNEY BEANS. 

These beans should be put into boiling water, a Uttle more than enough to 
cover them, and boiled tiU tender — from half an hour to two hours; serve with 
butter and salt upon them. 

These beans are in season from the last of July to the last of September, 
There are several other varieties of beans, used as summer vegetables, which 
are cooked as above. 

For Baked Beans, see " Pork and Beans." 

CELERY. 

This is stewed the same as green com, by boiUng, adding cream, butter, salt 
and pepper. 

STEWED SALSIFY OR OYSTER PLANT. 

Wash the roots and scrape off their skins, throwing them, as you do so, into 
cold water, for exposure to the air causes them to immediately turn dark. Then 
cut crosswise into little thin sUces; throw into fresh water, enough to cover; add 



l86 VEGETABLES. 

a little salt, and stew in a covered vessel until tender, or about one hour. Pour 
off a little of the water, add a small lump of butter, a little pepper, and a gUl of 
sweet cream, and a teaspoonful of flour stirred to a paste. Boil up and serve hot. 
Salsify may be simply boiled, and melted butter turned over them. 

FRIED SALSIFY. 
Stew the salsify as usual tiU very tender; then with the back of a spoon or a 
potato jammer, mash it very fine. Beat up an egg, add a teacupful of milk, a 
little flour, butter and seasoning of pepper and salt. Make into Uttle cakes, and 
fry a Ught brown in boiling lard, first rolling in beaten egg and then flour. 

BEETS BOILED. 

Select smaU-sized, smooth roots. They should be carefixUy washed, but not 
cut before boiling, as the juice will escape and the sweetness of the vegetable be 
impaired, leaving it white and hard. Put them into boiling water, and boil them 
unlal tender; which requires often from one to two hours. Do not probe them, 
but press them with the finger to ascertain if they are sufficiently done. When 
satisfied of this, take them up, and put them into a pan of cold water, and slip 
off the outside. Cut them into thin shces, and while hot season with butter, 
salt, a Uttle pepper and very sharp vinegar. 

BAKED BEETS. 
Beets retain their sugary, dehcate flavor to perfection if they are baked 
instead of boiled. Turn them frequently while in the oven, using a knife, as 
the fork allows the juice to run out. When done remove the skin, and serve, 
with butter, salt and pepper on the shces. 

STEWED BEETS. 
Boil them first, and then scrape and shce them. Put them into a stew-pan 
with a piece of butter rolled in flour, some boiled onion and parsley chopped fine, 
and a little vinegar, salt and pepper. Set the pan on the fire, and let the beets 
stew for a quarter of an hour. 

OKRA. 

This grows in the shape of pods, and is of a gelatinous character, much used 
for soup, and is also pickled; it may be boiled as follows. Put the young and 
tender pods of long white okra in salted boiUng water in granite, porcelain or a 
tin-lined saucepan — as contact with iron wiU discolor it; boil fifteen minutes; 
remove the stems, and serve with butter, pepper, salt and vinegar if preferred.

ASPARAGUS. 

Scrape the stems of the asparagus lightly, but very clean; throw them into 
cold water, and when they are all scraped and very clean, tie them in bunches 
of equal size; cut the laxge ends evenly, that the stems may be all of the same 
length, and put the asparagus into plenty of boiling water, well salted. While 
it is boiling, cut several shoes of bread half an inch thick, pare off the crust, and 
toast it a dehcate brown on both sides. When the stalks of the asparagus are 
tender, (it wiU usually cook in twenty to forty minutes), hft it out directly, or it 
win lose both its color and flavor, and will also be hable to break; dip the toast 
quickly into the hquor in which it was boiled, and dish the vegetable upon it, 
the heads all lying one way. Pour over white sauce, or melted butter. 

ASPARAGUS WITH EGGS. 

Boil a bunch of asparagus twenty minutes; cut off the tender tops and lay 
them in a deep pie plate, buttering, salting and peppering well. Beat up four 
eggs, the yolks and whites separately, to a stiff froth; add two tablespoonfuls of 
milk or cream, a tablespoonful of warm butter, pepper and salt to taste. Pour 
evenly over the asparagus mixture. Bake eight minutes or until the eggs are 
set. Very good. 

GREEN PEAS. 

Shell the peas and wash in cold water. Put in boiling water just enough to 
cover them well, and keep them from burning; boil from twenty minutes to 
half an hour, when the hquor should be nearly boiled out; season with pepper 
and salt, and a good allowance of butter; serve very hot. 

This is a very much better way than cooking in a larger quantity of water, 
and draining off the hquor, as that diminishes the sweetness, and much of the 
fine flavor of the peas is lost. The salt should never be put in the peas before 
they are tender, unless very young, as it tends to harden them 

STEWED GREEN PEAS. 

Into a sauce-pan of boihng water put two or three pints of young green peas, 
and when nearly done and tender, drain in a colander dry; then melt two 
ounces of butter in two of flour; stir weU, and boil five minutes longer; should 
the pods be quite clean and fresh, boil them first in the water, remove, and put 
in the peas. The Germans prepare a very palatable dish of sweet young pods 
alone, by simply stirring in a httle butter with some savory herbs.

SQUASHES, OR CYMBLINGS. 

The green or summer squash is best when the outside is beginning to turn 
yellow, as it is then less watery and insipid than when younger. Wash them, 
cut them into pieces, and take out the seeds. Boil them about three-quarters of 
an hour, or till quite tender. When done, drain and squeeze them well till you 
have pressed out aU the water; mash them with a httle butter, pepper and salt. 
Then put the sqiiash thus prepared into a stew-pan, set it on hot coals, and stir 
it very frequently tiU it becomes dry. Take care not to let it bum. 

Summer squash is very nice steamed, then prepared the same as boiled. 

BOILED WINTER SQUASH. 

This is much finer than the summer squash. It is fit to eat in August, and, 
in a dry warm place, can be kept well aU winter. The color is a very bright 
yellow. Pare it, take out the seeds, cut it in pieces, and stew it slowly tiU quite 
soft, in a very httle water. Afterwards drain, squeeze, and press it well; then 
mash it with a very httle butter, pepper and salt. They wiU boU in from twenty 
to forty minutes. 

BAKED WINTER SQUASH. 

Cut open the squash, take out the seeds, and without paring cut it up into 
large pieces; put the pieces on tins or a dripping-pan, place in a moderately hot 
oven, and bake about an hour. When done, peel and mash Uke mashed 
potatoes, or serve the pieces hot on a dish, to be eaten warm with butter like 
sweet potatoes. It retains its sweetness much better baked this way than when 
boUed. 

VEGETABLE HASH. 

Chop rather coarsely the remains of vegetables left from a boiled dinner, 
such as cabbage, parsnips, potatoes, etc., sprinkle over them a httle pepper; 
place in a saucepan or frying-pan over the fire; put in a piece of butter the size 
of a hickory nut; when it begins to melt, tip the dish so as to oil the bottom, and 
around the sides; then put in the chopped vegetables; pour in a spoonful or two 
of hot water from the tea-kettle; cover quickly so as to keep in the steam. 
When heated thoroughly take off the cover and stir occasionally until well 
cooked. Serve hot. Persons fond of vegetables wiU rehsh this dish very much. 

SPINACH. 
It should be cooked so as to retain its bright-green color, and not sent to 
table, as it so often is, of a duU-brown or oUve color; to retain its fresh appear- 
ance, do not cover the vessel whUe it is cooking. 



VEGETABLES. 189 

Spinach requii'es close examination and picking, as insects are frequently 
found among it, and it is often gritty. Wash it through three or four waters. 
Then draiu it and put it in boiling water. Fifteen to twenty miuutes is gener- 
ally sufficient time to boil spinach. Be careful to remove the scum. When it 
is quite tender, take it up, and drain and squeeze it well. Chop it fine, and put 
it iuto a sauce-pan with a piece of butter and a Uttle pepper and salt. Set it on 
the fire and let it stew five minutes, stirring it all the time, untU quite diy. 
Turn it into a vegetable dish, shape it into a mound, shoe some hard-boiled eggs 
and lay around the top. 

GREENS. 

About a peck of greens are enough for a mess for a family of six, such as 
dandelions, cowslips, burdock, chiccory and other greens. All greens should be 
carefully examined, the tough ones thrown out, then be thoroughly washed 
through several waters until they are entirely free from sand. The addition of a 
handful of salt to each pan of water used in washing the greens will free them 
from insects and worms, especially, if, after the last watering, they are allowed 
to stand in salted water for a half hour or longer. When ready to boil the 
greens, put them into a large pot half full of boOing water, with a handful of 
salt, and boil them steadily until the stalks are tender; this wiU be in from five 
to twenby minutes, according to the maturity of the greens; but remember that 
long-continued boiling wastes the tender substances of the leaves, and so 
diminishes both the bulk and the nourishment of the dish; for this reason it is 
best to cut away any tough stalks before beginning to cook the greens. As soon 
as they are tender, drain them in a colander, chop them a httle and return them 
to the fire long enough to season them with salt, pepper and butter; vinegar 
may be added if it is hked; the greens should be served as soon as they are hot. 

AU kinds of greens can be cooked in this manner. 

STEWED CARROTS. 
Wash and scrape the carrots, and divide them into strips; put them into a 
stew-pan with water enough to cover them; add a spoonful of salt, and let them 
boil slowly until tender; then drain and replace them in the pan, with two table- 
spoonfuls of butter rolled in flour, shake over a httle pepper and salt, then add 
enough cream or milk to moisten the whole; let it come to a boU and serve hot, 

CARROTS MASHED. 
Scrape and wash them; cook them tender in boiling water salted slightly. 
Drain weU and mash them. Work in a good piece of butter and season with 
pepper and salt. Heap up on a vegetable dish and serve hot. 



igo VEGETABLES. 

Carrots are also good simply boiled in salted water and dished up hot with 
melted butter over them. 

TURNIPS. 

Turnips are boiled plain with or without meat, also mashed like potatoes, and 
stewed Uke parsnips. They should always be served hot. They require from 
forty minutes to an hour to cook. 

STEWED PUMPKIN. 
See " Stewed Pumpkin for Pie." Cook the same, then after stewing, season 
the same as mashed potatoes. Pumpkin is good baked in the same manner as 
baked winter squash. 

STEWED ENDIVE. 

Ingredients. — Six heads of endive, salt and water, one pint of broth, thicken- 
ing of butter and flour, one tablespoonful of lemon juice, a small lump of sugar. 

Mode. — Wash and free the endive thoroughly from insects, remove the green 
part of the leaves, and put it into boihng water, slightly salted. Let it remain 
for ten minutes; then take it out, drain it till there is no water remaining, and 
chop it very fine. Put it into a stew-pan with the broth; add a httle salt and a 
lump of sugar, .and boU until the endive is perfectly tender. When done, which 
may be ascertained by squeezing a piece between the thumb and finger, add a 
thickening of butter and fioiu- and the lemon juice; let the sauce boil up, and 
serve. 

Time. — Ten minutes to boil, five minutes to simmer in the broth. 

BAKED MUSHROOMS. 
Prepare them the same as for stewing. Place them in a baking-pan, in a 
moderate oven. Season with salt, pepper, lemon juice, and chopped parsley. 
Cook in the oven fifteen minuted, baste with butter. Arrange on a dish and 
pour the gravy over them. Serve with sauce made by beating a cup of cream, 
two ounces of butter, a tablespoonful of chopped parsley, a httle cayenne pepper, 
salt, a tablespoonful of white sauce, and two tablespoonf uls of lemon juice. Put 
in a sauce-pan and set on the fire. Stir until thick, but do not let bolL Mush- 
rooms are very nice placed on shces of weU-buttered toast when set into the 
oven to bake. They cook in about fifteen minutes. 

STEWED MUSHROOMS. 
Time, twenty-one minutes. Button mushrooms; salt to taste; a little butter 
roUed in flour; two tablespoonfuls of cream or the yolk of one egg. Choose 



VEGETABLES. 191 

buttons of uniform size. Wipe them clean and white with a wet flannel; put 
them in a stew-pan with a Uttle water, and let them stew very gently for a quar 
ter of an hovir. Add salt to taste, work in a little flour and butter, to make the 
liquor about as thick as cream, and let it boil for five minutes. When you are 
ready to dish it up, stir in two tablespoonfuls of cream or the yolk of an egg; 
stir it over the fire for a minute, but do not let it boil, and serve. Stewed but- 
ton mushrooms are very nice, either in fish stews or ragouts, or served apart to 
eat with fish. Another way of doing them is to stew them in milk and water 
(after they are rubbed white), add to them a Uttle veal gravy, mace and salt, and 
thicken the gravy with cream or the yolks of eggs. 

Mushrooms can be cooked in the same manner as the recipes for oysters, 
either stewed, fried, broiled, or as a soup. They are also used to flavor sauces, 
catsups, meat gravies, game and soups. 

CANNED MUSHROOMS. 
Canned mushrooms may be served with good effect with game and even 
with beefsteak if prepared in this way: Open the can and pour off every drop of 
the liquid found there; let the mushrooms drain, then put them in a sauce-pan 
with a httle cream, and butter, pepper, and salt; let them simmer gently for 
from five to ten minutes, and when the meat is on the platter pour the mush- 
rooms over it. If served with steak, that should be very tender, and be broiled, 
never in any case fried. 

MUSHROOMS FOR WINTER USE. 

Wash and wipe free from grit the small fresh button mushrooms. Put into 
a frying-pan a quarter of a povmd of the very best butter. Add to it two whole 
cloves, a saltspoonful of salt, and a tablespoonful of lemon juice. When hot, 
add a quart of the small mushrooms, toss them about in the butter for a moment 
only, then put them in jars; fill the top of each jar with an inch or two of the 
butter and let it cool. Keep the jars in a cool place, and when the butter is 
quite firm, add a top layer of salt. Cover to keep out dust. 

The best mushrooms grow on uplands, or in high, open fields, where the air 
is pure. 

TRUFFLES. 

The truffle belongs to the family of the mushrooms; they are used principally 
in this country as a condiment for boned turkey and chicken, scrambled eggs, 
fillets of beef, game and fish. When mixed in due proportion, they add a pecu- 
liar zest and flavor to sauces, that cannot be found in any other plant in the 
vegetable kingdom.

ITALIAN STYLE OF DRESSING TRUFFLES. 

Ten truffles, a quarter of a pint of salad-oil, pepper and salt to taste, one 
tablespoonful of minced parsley, a very little finely minced garlic, two blades of 
pounded mace, one tablespoonful of lemon- juice. 

After cleansing and brushing the truffles, cut them into thia shces, and put 
them in a baking-dish, on a seasoning of oil or butter, pepper, salt, parsley, garlic 
and mace, in the above proportion. Bake them for nearly an hour, and just 
before serving, add the lemon juice and send them to table very hot. 

TRUFFLES AU NATUREL. 

Select some fine truffles; cleanse them, by washing them in several waters 
with a brush, until not a particle of sand or grit remains on them; wrap each 
truffle in buttered paper, and bake in a hot oven for quite an hour; take off the 
paper, wipe the truffles, and serve them in a hot napkin.

MACCARONI A LA ITALIENNE. 

Divide a quarter of a pound of maccaroni into four-inch pieces. Simmer 
fifteen minutes in plenty of boidng water, salted. Drain. Put the maccaroni 
into a sauce-pan and turn over it a strong soup stock, enough to prevent burn- 
ing. Strew over it an ounce of grated cheese; when the cheese is melted, dish. 
Put alternate layers of maccaroni and cheese; then turn over the soup stock and 
bake haJf an hour. 

MACCARONI AND CHEESE. 

Break half a pound of maccaroni into pieces an inch or two long; cook it in 
boiling water enough to cover it weU; put in a good teaspoonful of salt; let it 
boil about twenty minutes. Drain it weU, and then put a layer in the bottom of 
a weU-buttered pudding-dish, upon this some grated cheese, and small pieces of 
butter, a bit of salt, then more maccaroni, and so on, filling the dish; sprinkle 
the top layer with a thick layer of cracker-crumbs. Pour over the whole a tea- 
cupful of cream or milk. Set it in the oven and bake half an hour. It should 
be nicely browned on top. Serve in the same dish in which it was baked, with 
a clean napkin pinned around it.

TIMBALE OF MACCARONI. 

Break in very short lengths small maccaroni (vermicelli, spaghetti, tagharini). 
Let it be rather overdone; dress it with butter and grated cheese; then work 
Lato it one or two eggs, according to quantity. Butter and bread-crumb a plain 
mold, and when the maccaroni is nearly cold fill the mold with it, pressing it 
well down and leaving a hollow in the centre, into which place a well-flavored 
mince of meat, poultry or- game; then fill up the mold with more maccaroni, 
pressed weU down. Bake in a moderately heated oven, turn out and serve. 

MACCARONI A LA CR^ME. 

Boil one-quarter of a pound of maccaroni in plenty of hot water, salted, imtil 
tender; put half a pint of milk in a double boiler, and when it boils stir into it a 
mixture of two tablespoonfuls of butter and one of flour. Add two tablespoon- 
fuls of cream, a httle white and cayenne pepper; salt to taste, and from one- 
quarter to one-half a pound of grated cheese according to taste. Drain and dish 
the maccaroni; pour the boiling sauce over it, and serve immediately. 

MACCARONI AND TOMATO SAUCE. 

Divide half a poimd of maccaroni into four-inch pieces, put it into boiling 
salted water enough to cover it; boU from fifteen to twenty minutes; then drain; 
arrange it neatly on a hot dish, and pour tomato sauce over it. and serve imme- 
diately while hot. See " Sauces" for tomato sauce. 



TO MAKE BUTTER. 

Thoroughly scald the churn, then cool well with ice or spring water. Now 
poiu- in the thick cream; chum fast at first, then, as the butter forms, more 
slowly; always with perfect regularity; in warm weather, pour a Uttle cold 
water into the chum, should the butter form slowly; in winter, if the cream is 
too cold, add a httle warm water to bring it to the proper temperature. When 
the butter has " come," rinse the sides of the churn down with cold water, and 
take the butter up with the perforated dasher or a wooden ladle, turning it 
dexterously just below the surface of the buttermilk to catch every stray bit; 
have ready some very cold water, in a deep wooden tray; and into this plunge 
the dasher when you draw it from the chvmi; the butter wiU float off, leaving 
the dasher free. When you have collected aU the butter, gather behind a 
wooden butter ladle, and drain off the water, squeezing and pressing the butter 
with the ladle; then pour on more cold water, and work the butter with the 
ladle to get the milk out, drain off the water, sprinkle salt over the butter, — a. 
tablespoonful to a pound; work it in a little, and set in a cool place for an hour 
to harden, then work and knead it mitU not another drop of water exudes, and 
the butter is perfectly smooth and close in texture and poUsh; then with the 
ladle make up into roUs, little balls, stamped pats, etc. 

The chum, dasher, tray and ladle, should be well scalded before using, so that 
the butter will not stick to them, and then cooled with very cold water. 

When you skim cream into your cream jar, stir it well into what is already 
there, so that it may aU sour alike; and no fresh cream should be put with it 
within twelve hovirs before churning, or the butter wiU not come quickly; and 
perhaps, not at aU. 

Butter is indispensable in almost all culinary preparations. Good, fresh 
"Dutter. used in moderation, is easily digested; it is softening, nutritious, and 



BUTTER AND CHEESE. 195 

fattening, and is far more easily digested than any other of the oleaginous sub- 
stances sometimes used in its place. 

TO MAKE BUTTER QUICKLY. 

Immediately after the cow is milked, strain into clean pans, and set it over a 
moderate fire until it is scalding hot; do not let it boil; then set it aside; when 
it is cold, skim off the cream; the milk will still be fit for any ordinary use; 
when you have enough cream, put it into a clean earthen basin; beat it with a 
wooden spoon until the butter is made, which will not be long; then take it from 
the milk and work it with a httle cold water, until it is free from milk; then 
drain off the water, put a small tablespoonful of fine salt to each pound of 
butter, and work it in. A small teaspoonf ul of fine white sugar, worked in with 
the salt, will be found an improvement — sugar is a great preservative. Make 
the butter in a roll; cover it with a bit of mushn, and keep it in a cool place. 
A rehable recipe. 

A BRINE TO PRESERVE BUTTER. 

First work your butter into small roUs, wrapping each one carefully in a 
clean mushn cloth, tying them up with a string. Make a brine, say three 
gallons, having it strong enough of salt to bear up an egg; add half a teacupful 
of pure, white sugar, and one tablespoonful of saltpetre; boU the brine, and when 
cold strain it carefully. Pour it over the rolls so as to more than cover them, 
as this excludes the air. Place a weight over aU to keep the rolls under the 
surface. 

PUTTING UP BUTTER TO KEEP. 

Take of the best pure, common salt two quarts, one ounce of white sugar 

and one of saltpetre; pulverize them together completely. Work the butter 

well, then thoroughly work in an ounce of this mixture to every pound of 

butter. The butter to be made into half-poimd roUs, and put into the following 

brine — to three gallons of brine strong enough to bear an egg, add a quarter of 

a pound of white sugar. 

— Orange Go., N.Y., style. 

CURDS AND CREAM. 

One gallon of rmlk will make a moderate dish. Put one spoonfiil of prepared 
rennet to each quart of milk, and when you find that it has become curd, tie it 
loosely in a thin cloth and hang it to drain; do not wring or press the cloth; 
when drained, put the curd into a mug and set in cool water, which must be 
freguently changed (a refrigerator saves this trouble.) When you dish it, if 



196 BUTTER AND CHEESE. 

there is whey in the mug, ladle it gently out without pressing the curd; lay it 
on a deep dish, and pour fresh cream over it; have powdered loaf-sugar to eat 
with it; also hand the nutmeg grater. 

Prepared rennet can be had at almost any druggist's, and at a reasonable 
price. Call for Crosse & Blackwell's Prepared Eennet. 

NEW JERSEY CREAM CHEESE. 

First scald the quantity of milk desired; let it cool a little, then add the 
rennet; the directions for quantity are given on the packages of "Prepared 
Rennet." When the curd is formed, take it out on a ladle without breaking 
it; lay it on a thin cloth held by two persons; dash a ladleful of water over each 
ladleful of curd, to separate the curd; hang it up to drain the water off, and then 
put it under a Ught press for one hour; cut the curd with a thread into small 
pieces; lay a cloth between each two, and press for an hour; take them out, rub 
them with fine salt, let them lie on a board for an hour, and wash them in cold 
water; let them he to drain, and in a day or two the skin wiU look dry; put 
■some sweet grass under and over them, and they will soon ripen. 

COTTAGE CHEESE. 

Put a pan of sour or loppered milk on the stove or range, where it is not too 
hot; let it scald imtil the whey rises to the top (be careful that it does not boil, 
or the curd will become hard and tough). Piace a clean cloth or towel over a 
sieve, and pour this whey and curd into it, leaving it covered to drain two to 
three hours; then put it into a dish and chop it fine with a spoon, adding a tea- 
spoonful of salt, a tablespoonful of butter and enough sweet cream to make the 
cheese the consistency of putty. With your hands make it into httle balls flat- 
tened. Keep it in a cool place. Many Kke it made rather thin with cream, 
serving it in a deep dish. You may make this cheese of sweet milk, by forming 

the curd with prepared rennet. 

» 

SLIP. 

Slip is bonny-clabber without its acidity, and so delicate is its flavor that 
many persons like it just as well as ice-cream. It is prepared thus: Make a 
quart of milk moderately warm; then stir into it one large spoonful of the 
preparation called rennet; set it by, and when cool again it will be as stiff as 
jelly. It should be made only a few hours before it is to be used, or it wiU be 
tough and watery; in summer set the dish on ice after it has jeUied. It must be 
served with powdered sugar, nutmeg and cream. 



BUTTER AND CHEESM. 1 97 

CHEESE FONDU. 

Melt an ounce of butter, and whisk into it a pint of boiled milk. Dissolve 
two tablespoonfuls of flour in a gill of cold mUk, add it to the boUed mitk and 
let it cool. Beat the yolks of four eggs with a heaping teaspoonful of salt, half 
a teaspoonful of pepper, and five ounces of grated cheese. Whip the whites of 
the eggs and add them, pour the mixture into a deep tin Uned with buttered 
paper, and allow for the rising, say four inches. Bake twenty minutes and 
serve the moment it leaves the oven. 

CHEESE SOUFFLi. 

Melt an ounce of butter in a sauce-pan; mix smoothly with it one ounce of 
flour, a pinch of salt and cayenne and a quarter of a pint of milk; simmer the 
mixture gently over the flre, stirring it all the time, tUl it is as thick as melted 
butter; stir into it aTjout three ounces of finely-grated parmesan, or any good 
cheese. Turn it into a basin, and mix with it the yolks of two weU-beaten eggs. 
Whisk three whites to a sohd froth; and just before the souffle is baked put 
them into it, and pour the mixture into a small round tin. It should be only 
half filled, as the fondu will rise very high. Pin a napkin around the dish in 
which it is baked, and serve the moment it is baked. It would be well to have a 
metal cover strongly heated. Time twenty minutes. Sufficient for six persons. 

SCALLOPED CHEESE. 

Any person who is fond of cheese could not fail to favor this recipe. 

Take three sUces of bread, well-buttered, first cutting off the brown outside 
crust. Grate fijie a quarter of a pound of any kind of good cheese; lay the 
bread in layers in a buttered baking-dish, sprinkle over it the grated cheese, 
some salt and pepper to taste. Mix four well-beaten eggs with three cups of 
milk; pour it over the bread and cheese. Bake it in a hot oven as you would 
cook a bread pudding. This makes an ample dish for four people. 

PASTRY RAMAKINS. 

Take the remains or odd pieces of any light puff-paste left from pies or tarts; 
gather up the pieces of paste, roll it out evenly, and sprinkle it with grated 
cheese of a nice flavor. Fold the paste in three, roll it out again, and sprinkle 
more cheese ovra-; fold the paste, roU it out, and with a paste-cutter shape it in 
any way that may be desired. Bake the ramakins in a brisk oven from ten to 
fifteen minutes, dish them on a hot napkin, and serve quickly. The appearance 



198 BUTTER AND CHEESE. 

of this dish may be very much improved by brushing the ramaMns over with 
yolk of egg before they are placed ia the oven. Where expense is not objected 
to, parmesan is the best kind of cheese to use for making this dish. 
Very nice with a cup of coffee for a lunch. 

CAYENNE CHEESE STRAWS. 

A quarter of a pound of flour, 2 oz. butter, 2 oz. grated parmesan cheese, a 
pinch of salt, and a few grains of cayenne pepper. Mis into a paste with the 
yolk of an egg. EoU out to the thickness of a silver quarter, about four or five 
inches long; cut into strips about a third of an inch wide, twist them as you 
would a paper spiU, and lay them on a baking-sheet sUghtly floured. Bake in a 
moderate oven untU crisp, but they must not be the least brown. If put away 
in a tin, these cheese straws will keep a long time. Serve cold, piled tastefully 
on a glass dish. You can make the straws of remnants of puff -pastry, rolling 
in the grated cheese. 

CHEESE CREAM TOAST. 

Stale bread may be served as follows: Toast the slices and cover them sUghtly 
with grated cheese; make a cream for ten sUces out of a pint of milk and two 
tablespoonf uls of plain flour. The mOk should be boiliag, and the flour mixed 
in a httle cold water before stirring in. When the cream is nicely cooked, season 
with salt and butter; set the toast and cheese in the oven for three or four 
minutes, and then pour the cream over them. 

WELSH RAREBIT. 

Grate three ounces of dry cheese, and mix it with the yolks of two eggs, put 
four ounces of grated bread, and three of butter; beat the whole together in a 
mortar with a dessertspoonful of made mustard, a little salt and some pepper; 
toast some slices of bread, cut off the outside crust, cut it in shapes and spread 
the paste thick upon them, and put them in the oven, let them become hot and 
slightly browned, serve hot as possible. 




There are so many ways of cooking and dressing eggs, that it seems un- 
necessary for the ordinary family to use only those that are the most practical. 

To ascertain the freshness of an egg, hold it between your thumb and fore- 
finger in a horizontal position, with a strong hght in front of you. The fresh 
egg will have a clear appearance, both upper and lower sides being the same. 
The stale egg wiU have a clear appearance at the lower side, while the upper side 
will exhibit a dark or cloudy appearance. 

Another test is to put them in a pan of cold water; those that are the first to 
sink are the freshest; the stale will rise and float on top; or, if the large end 
turns up in the water, they are not fresh. The best time for preserving eggs is 
from July to September. 

TO PRESERVE EGGS. 

There are several recipes for preserving eggs, and we give first one which we 
know to be effectual, keeping them fresh from August until Spring. Take a piece 
of quick-hme as large asagood-sizec* lemon, and two teacupf uls of salt; put it into 
a la^e vessel and slack it with a gallpu of boihng water. It will boU and bubble 
until thick as cream; when it is cold, pour off the top, which will be perfectly 
clear. Drain off this Kquor, and pour it over your eggs; see that the liquor 
more than covers them. A stone jar is the most convenient; — one that holds 
about six quarts. 

Another manner of preserving eggs is to pack them in a jar with layers of 
salt between, the large end of the egg downward, with a thick layer of salt at 
the top; cover tightly, and set in a cool place. 

Some put them in a wire basket or a piece of mosquito net, and dip them in 
boiling water half a minute; then pack in saw-dust. StiU another manner is to 
dissolve a cheap article of gum arabic, about as thin as mucilage, and brush 
over each egg with it; then pack in powdered charcoal; set in a cool, dark place. 



200 EGGS. 

Eggs can be kept for some time by smearing the shells with butter or lard; 
then packed in plenty of bran or sawdust, the eggs not allowed to touch one 
another; or coat the eggs with melted paraffine. 

BOILED EGGS. 

Eggs for boiling cannot be too fresh, or boiled too soon after they are laid; 
but rather a longer time should be allowed for boiling a new-laid egg than for 
one that is three or fom* days old. Ha-^3 ready a sauce pan of boiUng water; 
put the eggs into it gently with a sp':^n, letting the spoon touch the bottom of 
the sauce-pan before it is withdrawn, that the egg may not fall, and conse- 
quently crack. For those who like eggs lightly boiled, three minutes will be 
found sufficient; three and three-quarters to four minutes will be ample time to 
set the white nicely; and if hked hard, six or seven minutes will not be found 
too long. Should the eggs be unusually large, as those of black Spanish fowls 
sometimes are, allow an extra half minute for them. Eggs for salad should be 
boiled for ten or fifteen minutes, and should be placed in a basin of cold water 
for a few minutes, to shrink the meat from the shell; they should then be rolled 
on the table with the hand, and the shell will peel off easily. 

SOFT BOILED EGGS. 

When properly cooked, eggs are donp evenly through, like any other food. 
This result may be obtained by putting the egg into a dish with a cover, or a tin 
pail, and then pouring upon them boiling water — two quarts or more to a dozen 
of eggs — and cover and set them away where they will keep hot and not boU, for 
ten to twelve minutes. The heat of the water cooks the eggs slowly, evenly and 
sufficiently, leaving the centre, or yolk, harder than the white, and the egg tastes 
as much richer and nicer as a fresh egg is nicer than a stale egg. 

SCALLOPED EGGS. 

Hard-boil twelve eggs; sUce them thin in rings; in the bottom of a large 
weU-buttered baking-dish place a layer of grated bread-crumbs, then one of 
eggs; cover with bits of butter, and sprinkle with pepper and salt. Continue 
thus to blend these ingredients untU the dish is full; be sure, though, that the 
crumbs cover the eggs upon top. Over the whole pour a large teacupful of 
sweet cream or milk, and brown nicely in a moderately heated oven. 

SHIRRED EGGS. 

Set into the oven untU quite hot a common white dish, large enough to hold 
the number of eggs to be cooked, allowing plenty of room for each. Melt in it a 



EGGS. 20 1 

small piece of butter, and breaking the eggs carefully in a saucer, one at a time, 
slip them into the hot dish; sprinkle over them a small quantity of pepper and 
salt, and allow them to cook foiu* or five minutes. Adding a tablespoonful of 
cream for every two eggs, when the eggs are first shpped in, is a great improve- 
ment. 

This is far more deUcate than fried eggs. 

Or prepare the eggs the same, and set them in a steamer, over boiling water. 

They are usually served in hotels baked in individual dishes, about two in a 
dish, and in the same dish they were baked in. 

SCRAMBLED EGGS. 
Put a tablespoonful of butter into a hot frying-pan; tip around so that it will 
touch all sides of the pan. Having ready half a dozen eggs broken in a dish, 
salted and peppered, turn them (without beating) into the hot butter; stir them 
one way briskly for five or six minutes or until they are mixed. Be careful that 
they do not get too hard. Turn over toast or dish up without. 

POACHED OR DROPPED EGGS. 

Have one quart of boiling water, and one tablespoonful of salt, in a frying- 
pan. Break the eggs, one by one, into a saucer, and shde carefully into the 
salted water. Dash with a spoon a httle water over the egg, to keep the top 
white. 

The beauty of a poached egg is for the yolk to be seen blushing through the 
white, which should only be just sufficiently hardened to form a transparent veil 
for the egg. 

Cook until the white is firm, and lift out with a griddle-cake turner, and place 
on toasted bread. Serve immediately. 

A tablespoonful of vinegar put into the water, keeps the eggs from spreading. 

Open gem rings are nice placed in the water and an egg dropped into each 
ring. 

FRIED EGGS. 

Break the eggs, one at a time, into a saucer, and then shde them carefully 
off into a frying-pan of lard and butter mixed, dipping over the eggs the hot 
grease in spoonfuls, or turn them over-frying both sides without breaking them. 
They require about three minutes' cooking. 

Eggs can be fried round like balls, by dropping one at a time into a quantity 
of hot lard, the same as for fried cakes, first stirring the hot lard with a stick 
until it runs round like a whirlpool; this will make the eggs look Uke balls. 
Take out with a skimmer. Eggs can be poached the same in boiling water. 



202 EGGS. 

EGGS AUX FINES HERBES. 

Eoll an ounce of butter in a good teaspoonful of flour; season with pepper, 
salt and nutmeg; put it into a coflfeecupful of fresh milk, together with two tea- 
spoonfuls of chopped parsley; stir and simmer it for fifteen minutes, add a 
teacupful of thick cream. Hard-boH five eggs, and halve them; arrange them 
in a dish with the ends upwards, pour the sauce over them, and decorate with 
little heaps of fried bread-crumbs round the margin of the dish. 

POACHED EGGS A LA CR£ME. 

Put a quart of hot water, a tablespoonful of vinegar and a teaspoonful of salt 
into a frying-pan, and break each egg separately into a saucer; sUp the egg care- 
fully into the hot water, simmer three or four minutes until the white is set, 
then with a skimmer hft them out into a hot dish. Empty the pan of its 
contents, put in half a cup of cream, or rich mitk; if milk, a large spoonful of 
butter; pepper and salt to taste, thicken with a very Utile cornstarch; let it boil 
up once, and turn it over the dish of poached eggs. It can be served on toast or 
without. 

It is a better plan to warm the cream and butter in a separate dish, that the 
eggs may not have to stand. 

EGGS IN CASES. 

Make little paper cases of buttered writing paper; put a small piece of butter 
in each, and a httle chopped parsley or onion; pepper and salt. Place the cases 
upon a gridiron over a moderate fire of bright coals, and when the butter melts, 
break a fresh egg into each case. Strew in upon them a few seasoned bread- 
crumbs, and when nearly done, glaze the tops with a hot shovel. Serve in the 
paper cases. 

MINCED EGGS. 

Chop up four or five hard-boiled eggs; do not mince them too fine. Put over 
the fire in a suitable dish a cupful of milk, a tablespoonful of butter, salt and 
pepper, and some savory chopped small. When this comes to a boil, stir into it 
a tablespoonful of fiour, dissolved in a httle cold milk. When it cooks thick like 
cream, put in the minced eggs. Stir it gently around and around for a few 
moments, and serve, garnished with sippets of toast. Any particular flavor may 
be given to this dish, such as that of mushrooms, truffles, catsup, essence of 
shrimps, etc., or some shred anchovy may be added to the minoe.

MIXED EGGS AND BACON. 
Take a nice rasher of mild bacon; cut it into squares no larger than dice; fry- 
it quickly until nicely browned, but on no account bum it. Break half a dozen 
eggs into a basin, strain and season them with pepper, add them to the bacon, 
stir the whole about, and, when sufficiently firm, turn it out into a dish. Decorate 
with hot pickles. 

MIXED EGGS GENERALLY.— SAVORY OR SWEET. 

Much the same method is followed in mixed eggs generally, whatever may 
be added to them; reaUy it is nothing more than an omelet which is stirred about 
ia the pan while it is being di'essed, instead of being allowed to set as a pancake. 
Chopped tongue, oysters, shrimps, sardines, dried salmon, anchovies, herbs, may 
be used. 

COLD EGGS FOR A PICNIC. 

This novel way of preparing cold egg for the limch-basket fully repays one 
for the extra time required. Boil hard several eggs, halve them lengthwise; 
remove the yolks and chop them fine with cold chicken, lamb, veal or any 
tender, roasted meat; or with bread soaked in milk, and any salad, as parsley, 
onion, celery, the br^ad being half of the whole; or with grated cheese, a httle 
oUve oil, drawn butter, flavored. MU the cavity in the egg with either of these 
mixtures, or any similar preparation. Press the halves together, roU twice in 
beaten egg and bread-crumbs, and dip into boiUng lard. When the color rises 
'HeHcately, drain them and they are ready for use. 

OMELETS. 
In making an omelet, care should be taken that the omelet pan is hot and 
dry. To ensure this, put a small quantity of lard or suet into a clean frying- 
pan, let it simmer a few minutes, then remove it; wipe the pan dry with a 
towel, and then put in a tablespoonfid of butter. The smoothness of the pan is 
most essential, as the least particle of roughness wiU cause the omelet to stick. 
As a general rule, a small omelet can be made more successfully than a large 
one, it being much better to make two small ones of four eggs each, than to try 
double the number of eggs in one omelet and fail. AUow one egg to a person in 
making an omelet and one tablespoonful of milk; this makes an omelet more 
puffy and tender than onu made without milk. Many prefer them without, 
milk. 

Omelets are called by the name of what is added to give them flavor, as

minced ham, salmon, onions, oysters, etc., beaten up in the eggs in due quan- 
tity, which gives as many different kinds of omelets. 

They are also served over many kinds of thick sauces or purees, such as 
tomatoes, spinach, endive, lettuce, celery, etc. 

If vegetables are to be added, they should be already cooked, seasoned and 
hot; place in the centre of the omelet, just before turning; so with mushroom, 
shrimps, or any cooked ingredients. All omelets should be served the moment 
they are done, as they harden by standing, and care taken that they do not cooh 
too much. 
' Sweet omelets are generally used for breakfast or plain desserts. 

PLAIN OMELET, 

Put a smooth, clean, iron frying-pan on the fire to heat; meanwhile, beat 
four eggs, very hght, the whites to a stiff froth, and the yolks to a thick batter. 
Add to the yolks four tablespoonfuls of milk, pepper and salt; and lastly stir in 
the whites lightly. Put a piece of butter nearly half the size of an egg into the 
heated pan; turn it so that it will moisten the entire bottom, taking care that it 
does not scorch. Just as it begins to boil, pour in the eggs. Hold the frying- 
pan handle in your left hand, and, as tue eggs whiten, carefully, with a spoon, 
draw up hghtly from the bottom, letting the raw part run out on the pan, 
tin aU be equally cooked; shake with your left hand, till the omelet be free from 
the pan, then turn with a spoon one half of the omelet over the other; let it 
remain a moment, but continue shaking, lest it adhere; toss to a warm platter 
held in the right hand, or lift with a flat, broad shovel; the omelet will be firm 
around the edge, but creamy and hght inside. 

MEAT OR FISH OMELETS. 

Take cold meat, fish, game or poultry of any kind; remove aU skin, sinew, 
etc., and either cut it small or pound it to a paste in a mortar, together with a 
proper proportion of spices and salt; then either toss it in a buttered frying-pan 
over a clear fire till it begins to brown, and pour beaten eggs upon it, or beat it 
up with the eggs, or spread it upon them after they have begun to set in the 
pan. In any case serve hot, with or without a sauce; but garnished with crisp 
herbs in branches, pickles, or shced lemon. The right proportion is one table- 
spoonful of meat to four eggs. A httle milk, gravy, water, or white wine, may 
be advantageously added to the eggs while they are being beaten. 

Potted meats make admirable omelets in the above manner.

VEGETABLE OMELET. 

Make a puree by mashing up ready-dressed vegetables, together with a little 
mUk, cream or gravy, and some seasoning. The most suitable vegetables are 
cucumbers, artichokes, onions, sorrel, green peas, tomatoes, lentils, mushrooms, 
asparagus tops, potatoes, truffles or turnips. Prepare some eggs by beating 
them very light. Pour them into a nice hot frying-pan, containing a spoonful 
of butter; spread the puree upon the upper side; and when perfectly hot, turn 
or fold the omelet together and serve. Or cold vegetables may be merely chopped 
small, then tossed in a Uttle butter, and some beaten and seasoned eggs poured 
over. 

OMELET OF HERBS. 

Parsley, thyme, and sweet marjoram mixed gives the famous omelette aux 
fines herbes so popular at every wayside inn in the most remote corner of sunny 
France. An omelet " jardiniere " is two tablespoonfuls of mixed parsley, onion, 
chives, shalots and a few leaves each of sorrel and chevril, minced fine and 
stirred into the beaten eggs before cooking. It will take a Uttle more butter to 
fry it than a plain one. 

CHEESE OMELET. 

Beat up three eggs, and add to them a tablespoonfrd of milk and a table- 
spoonful of grated cheese; add a little more cheese before folding; turn it out 
on a hot dish; grate a little cheese over it before serving. 

ASPARAGUS OMELET. 

Bon with a Uttle salt, and until about half cooked, eight or ten stalks of 
asparagus, and cut the eatable part into rather small pieces; beat the eggs, and 
mW the asparagus with them. Make the omelet as above directed. 

Omelet with parsley is made by adding a Uttle chopped parsley. 

TOMATO OMELET. No. i. 
Peel a couple of tomatoes, which spUt into four pieces; remove the seeds, and 
cut them into small dice; then fry them with a Uttle butter until nearly done, 
adding salt and pepper. Beat the eggs and mix the tomatoes with them, and 
make the omelet as usual. Or, stew a few tomatoes ia the usual way and spread 
over before folding. 

TOMATO OMELET. No. 2. 
Cut in sUces and place in a stew-pan six peeled tomatoes; add a tablespoonful 
of cold water, a Uttle pepper, and salt. When they begin to simmer, break in 



206 ' EGGS. 

six eggs, sxir well, stirring one way, until the eggs are cooked, but not too hard. 
Serve warm. 

RICE OMELET. 
Take a cupful of cold boiled rice, turn over it a cupful of warm milk, add a 
tablespoonful of butter melted, a level teaspoonful of salt, a dash of pepper; 
mix well, then add three well-beaten eggs. Put a tablespoonful of butter in a 
hot frying-pan, and when it begins to boil pour in the omelet and set the pan 
in a hot oven. As soon as it is cooked through, fold it double, turn it out on a 
hot dish, and serve at once. Very good. 

HAM OMELET. 

Cut raw ham into dice, fry with butter, and when cooked enough, turn the 
beaten egg over it, and cook as a plain omelet. 

If boiled ham is used, mince it, and mix with the eggs after they are beaten. 
Bacon may be used instead of raw ham. 

CHICKEN OMELET. 

Mince rather fine one cupful of cooked chicken, warm in a teacupful of 
cream or rich milk, a tablespoonful of butter, salt and pepper; thicken with a 
large tablespoonf lil of flour. Make a plain omelet, then add this mixture, just 
before turning it over. This is much' better tha,n the dry minced chicken. 
Tongue is equally good, 

. ♦ MUSHROOM OMELET. 

Clean a cupful of large button mushrooms, canned ones may be used; cut 
them into bits. Put into a stew-pan an ounce of butter and let it melt; add the 
mushrooms, a teaspoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful of pepper, and half a cupf nl 
of cream or mUk. Stir in a teaspoonful of flour, dissolved in a Uttle milk or 
water to thicken, if needed. BoU ten minutes, and set aside until the omelet is 
ready. 

Make a plain omelet the usual way, and just before doubling it, turn the 
mushrooms over the centre and serve hot. 

OYSTER OMELET. 

Parboil a dozen oysters in their own hquor, skim them out, and let them 
cool; add them to the beaten eggs, either whole or minced. Cook the same as 
a plain omelet. 

Thicken the Uquid with butter roUed in flour; season with salt, cayenne 
pepper and a teaspoonful of chopped parsley. Chop up the oysters and add to 



EGGS. 207 

the sauce. Put a few spoonfuls in the centre of the omelet before folding; when 
dished, pour the remainder of the sauce around it. 

FISH OMELET. 
Make a plain omelet, and when ready to fold, spread over it fish prepared as 
follows: Add to a cupful of any kind of cold fish, broken fine, cream enough to 
moisten it, seasoned with a tablespoonful of butter; then pepper and salt to taste. 
Warm together. 

ONION OMELET. 
Make a plain omelet, and when ready to turn spread over it a teaspoonful 
each of chopped onion and minced parsley; then fold, or, if prepared, mix the 
minces into the eggs before cooking. 

JELLY OMELET. 
Make a plain omelet, and just before folding together, spread with some kind 
of jeUy. Turn out on a warm platter. Dust it with powdered sugar. 

BREAD OMELET. No. I. 
Break four eggs into a basin and carefully remove the treadles; have ready a 
tablespoonful of grated and sifted bread; soak it in either milk, water, cream, 
white wine, gravy, lemon- jvdce, brandy or rum, according as the omelet is 
intended to be sweet or savory. WeU beat the eggs together with a httle nut- 
meg, pepper and salt; add the bread, and, beating constantly (or the omelet will 
be crumbly), get ready a frying-pan, buttered and made thoroughly hot; put in 
the omelet; do it on one side only; turn it upon a dish, and fold it double to 
prevent the steam from condensing. Stale sponge-cake, grated biscuit, or 
pound cake, may replace the bread for a sweet omelet, when pounded loaf sugar 
should be sifted over it, and the dish decorated with lumps of currant jelly. Thia 
makes a nice dessert. 

BREAD OMELET. No. 2. 

Let one teacup of nulk come to a boil, pour it over one teacupful of bread- 
crumbs and let it stand a few minutes. Break six eggs into a bowl, stir (not 
beat) till well mixed; then add the mUk and bread, season with pepper and salt, 
mix all well together and tiuTi into a hot frying-pan, containing a large spoonfid 
of butter boiling hot. Fry the omelet slowly, and when brown on the bottom 
cut in squares and turn again, fry to a delicate brown and serve hot. 

Cracker omelet may be made by substituting three or four roUed crackers in 
place of bread.

BAKED OMELET. 

Beat the whites and yolks of four or six eggs separately; add to the yolks a 
smaU cup of milk, a tablespoonf ul of flour or cornstarch, a teaspoonf ul of baking, 
powder, one-half teaspoonful of salt, and lastly, the stiff -beaten whites. Bake 
in a weU buttered pie-tin or plate, about half an hour in a steady oven. 

It should be served the moment it is taken from the oven, as it is Uable to fall 

OMELET SOUFFL^. 

Break six eggs into separate cups; beat four of the yolks, mix with them one 
teaspoonful of flour, three tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar, very little salt. 
Flavor with extract lemon or any other of the flavors that may be preferred 
Whisk the whites of six eggs to a firm froth; mix them lightly with the yolks; 
pour the mixture into a greased pan or dish; bake in a quick oven. When well- 
risen and lightly brovmed on the top, it is done; roll out in warm dish, sift pul- 
verized sugar over, and send to table. 

RUM OMELET. 

Put a small quantity of lard into the pan; let it simmer a few minutes, and 
remove it; wipe the pan dry with a towel, and put in a httle fresh lard in which 
the omelet may be fried. Care should be taken that the lard does not burn, 
which would spoil the color of the omelet. Break three eggs separately; put 
them into a bowl and whisk them thoroughly with a fork. The longer they 
are beaten, the Ughter will the omelet be. Beat up a teaspoonful of milk with 
the eggs and continue to beat until the last moment before pouring into the pan, 
which should be over a hot fire. As soon as the omelet sets, remove the pan 
from the hottest part of the fire. Slip a knife under it to prevent sticking to the 
pan. When the centre is almost firm, slant the pan, work the omelet in shape 
to fold easily and neatly, and when sUghtly browned, hold a platter against the 
edge of the pan and deftly turn it out on to the hot dish. Dust a Uberal quan- 
tity of powdered sugar over it, and singe the sugar into neat stripes with a hot 
iron rod, heated in the coals; pour a glass of warm Jamaica rum aroimd it, and 
when it is placed on the table set fire to the rum. With a tablespoon dash the 
burning rum over the omelet, put out the fire and serve. Salt mixed with the 
eggs prevents them from rising, and when it is so used the omelet wiU look 
flabby, yet without salt it will taste insipid. Add a httle salt to it just before 
folding it and turning out on the dish.

HAM SANDWICHES. 

Make a dressing of half a cup of butter, one tablespoonful of mixed mustard, 
one of salad oU, a little red or white pepper, a pinch of salt and the yolk, of an 
egg; rub the butter to a cream, add the other ingredients and mix thoroughly; 
then stir in as much chopped ham as will make it consistent, and spread between 
thin slices of bread. Omit salad oil and substitute melted butter, if preferred. 

HAM SANDWICHES, PLAIN. 
Trim the crusts from thin slices of bread; butter them, and lay between every 
two some thin shces of cold, boiled ham. Spread the meat with a little mustard, 
if liked. 

CHICKEN SANDWICHES. 

Mince up fine any cold boiled or roasted chicken; put it into a sauce-pan with 
gravy, water or cream enough to soften it; add a good piece of butter, a pinch 
of pepper; work it very smooth while it is heating until it looks almost like a 
paste. Then spread it on a plate to cool. Spread it between slices of buttered 
bread. 

SARDINE SANDWICHES. 

Take two boxes of sardines, and throw the contents into hot water, having 
first drained away all the oil. A few minutes wHl free the sardines from grease. 
Pour away the water and dry the fish in a cloth; then scrape away the skins, 
ftnd pound the sardines in a mortar till reduced to paste; add pepper, salt, and 
gome tiny pieces of lettuce, and spread on the sandwiches, which have been pre- 
vvwwAy cut as above. The lettuce adds very much to the flavor of the sardines. 

Or chop the sardines up fine and squeeze a few drops of lemon-juice into them 
and spread between buttered bread or cold biscuits.

WATERCRESS SANDWICHES. 

Wash •well some watercress, and then dry them in a cloth, pressing out eveiy 

atom of moisture, as far as possible; then mix with the cresses hard-boiled eggs 

chopped fine, and seasoned with salt and pepper. Have a stale loaf and some 

fresh butter, and with a sharp knife, cut as many thin slices as wiU be required 

for two dozen sandwiches; then cut the cress into small pieces, removing the 

stems; place it between each shoe of bread and butter, with a shght sprinkling 

of lemon- juice; press down the slices hard, and cut them sharply on a board into 

small squares, leaving no crust.

EGG SANDWICHES. 

Hard boil some very fresh eggs, and when cold, cUt them into moderately 
thin slices, and lay them between some bread and butter cut as thin as possible; 
season them with pepper, salt and nutmeg. For picnic parties, or when one is 
travelling, these sandwiches are far preferable to hard-boiled eggs au naturel. 

MUSHROOM SANDWICHES. 

Mince beef tongue and boiled mushrooms together, add French mustard, and 
spread between buttered bread. 

CHEESE SANDWICHES. 

These are extremely nice, and are very easily made. Take one hard-boiled 
«gg, a quarter of a pound of common cheese grated, half a teaspoonful of salt, 
half a teaspoonful of pepper, half a teaspoonful of mustard, one tablespoonful of 
melted butter, and one tablespoonful of vinegar or cold water. Take the yolk 
of the egg and put it into a small bowl and crumble it down, put into it the 
butter and mix it smooth with a spoon, then add the salt, pepper, mustard, and 
the cheese, mixing each well. Then put in the tablespoonful of vinegar, which 
win make it the proper thickness. If vinegar is not relished, then use cold 
water instead. Spread this between two biscuits or pieces of oat-cake, and you 
could not require a better sandwich. Some people wiU prefer the sandwiche~ 
less highly seasoned, In that case, season to taste. 




THE FAMOUS EAST ROOM. 




THE RED ROOM. 



THE BLUE ROOM. 




Among all civilized people bread has become an article of food of the first 
necessity; and properly so, for it constitutes of itself a complete life sustainer, 
the gluten, starch and sugar which it contains reprssentiug ozotized and hydro- 
carbonated nutrients, and combining the sustaining powers of the animal and 
vegetable kingdoms in one product. As there is no one article of food that 
enters so largely into our daily fare as bread, so no degree of skill in preparing 
other articles can compensate for lack of knowledge in the art of making good, 
palatable and nutritious bread. A little earnest attention to the subject will 
enable any one to comprehend the theory, and then ordinary care in practice will 
make one familiar with the process. 

GENERAL DIRECTIONS. 

The first thing required for making wholesome bread is the utmost cleanli- 
ness; the next is the soundness and sweetness of all the ingredients used for it; 
and, in addition to these, there must be attention and care through the whole 
process. 

Salt is always used in bread-making, not only on account of its flavor, which 
destroys the insipid raw state of the flour, but because it makes the dough rise 
better. 

In mixing with milk, the milk should be boiled — not simply scalded, but 
heated to boiling over hot water — then set aside to cool before mixing. Simple 
heating wiU not prevent bread from turning sour in the rising, while boUing will 
act as a preventive. So the milk should be thoroughly scalded, and should be 
used when it is just blood warm. 

Too small a proportion of yeast, or insufficient time allowed for the dough to 
rise, wiU cause the bread to be heavy. 

The yeast must be good and fresh if the bread is to be digestible and nice. 
Stale yeast produces, instead of vinous fermentation, an acetous fermentation. 



212 BREAD. 

which flavors the bread and makes it disagreeable. A poor, thin yeast produces 
an imperfect fermentation, the result being a heavy unwholesome loaf. 

If either the sponge or the dough be permitted to overwork itself — that is to 
say, if the mixing and kneading be neglected when it has reached the proper 
point for either — sour bread will probably be the consequence in warm weather, 
and bad bread in any. The goodness wiU also be endangered by placiag it so 
near a fire as to make any part of it hot, instead of maintaining the gentle and 
equal degree of heat required for its due fermentation. 

Heavy bread will also most Ukely be the result of making the dough very 
hard, and letting it become quite cold, particularly in winter. 

An almost certain way of spoiling dough is to leave it half -made, and to 
allow it to become cold before it is finished. The other most common causes of 
failure are using yeast which is no longer sweet, or which has been frozen, op 
has had hot liquid poured over it. 

As a general rule, the oven for baking bread should be rather quick, and the 
heat so regulated as to penetrate the dough without hardening the outside. The 
oven-door should not be opened after the bread is put in until the dough is set 
or has become firm, as the cool air admitted will have an unfavorable effect on it. 

The dough should rise" and the bread begin to brown after about fifteen 
minutes, but only shghtly. Bake from fifty to sixty minutes, and have it 
brown, not black or whitey brown, but brown aU over when well baked. 

"When the bread is baked, remove the loaves immediately from the pans, 
and place them where the air wiU circulate freely around them and thus carry 
off the gas which has been formed, but is no longer needed. 

Never leave the bread in the pan or on a pine table to absorb the odor of the 
wood. If you hke crusts that are crisp do not cover the loaves; but to give the 
soft, tender, wafer-like consistency which many prefer, wrap them, while stiU 
hot, in several thicknesses of bread-cloth. "When cold put them in a stone jar, 
removing the cloth, as that absorbs the moistmre and gives the bread an mipleasant 
taste and odor. Keep the jar well covered, and carefully cleansed from crumbs 
and stale pieces. Scald and dry it thoroughly every two or three days. A yard 
and a half square of coarse table linen makes the best bread-cloth. Keep in good 
supply; use them for no other purpose. 

Some people use scalding water in making wheat bread; in that case the flour 
must be scalded and allowed to cool before the yeast is added, — then proceed as 
above. Bread made in this manner keeps moist in siunmer, much longer than 
when made in the usual mode. 

Home-made yeast is generally preferred to any other. Compressed yeast, a*^ 



BREAD. ' 213 

now sold in most grocery stores, makes fine light, sweet bread, and is a much 
quicker process, and can always be had fresh, being made fresh every day. 

WHEAT BREAD. 

Sift the flour into a large bread-pan or bowl; make a hole in the middle of it, 
and pour in the yeast in the ratio of half a teacupf ul of yeast to two quarts of 
flour; stir the yeast hghtly, then pour in your " wetting," either milk or water, 
as you choose, — which use warm in winter, and cold in summer; if you use 
water as " wetting," dissolve in it a bit of butter of the size of an egg,— if you 
use milk, no butter is necessary; stir in the " wetting " very Ughtly, but do not 
mix all the flour into it; then cover the pan with a thick blanket or towel, and 
set it, in winter, in a warm place to rise, — ^this is called "putting the bread in 
sponge." In summer the bread should not be wet over night. In the morning 
add a teaspoonful of salt and mix aU the flour in the pan with the sponge, 
kneading it well; then let it stand two hours or more until it has risen qmte 
light; then remove the dough to the molding-board and mold it for a long 
time, cutting it in pieces and molding them together again and again, until the 
dough is elastic iznder the pressure of your hand, using as httle flour as possible; 
then make it into loaves, put the loaves into baking-tins. The loaves should 
come half-way up the pan, and they should be allowed to rise until the bulk is 
doubled. When the loaves are ready to be put into the oven, the oven should 
be ready to receive them. It shovild be hot enough to brown a teaspoonful of 
flour in five minutes. The heat should be greater at the bottom than at the top 
of the oven, and the fire so arranged as to give sufficient strength of heal; 
through the baking without being replenished. Let them stand ten or fifteen 
minutes, prick them three or four times with a fork, bake in a qmck oven from 
forty-five to sixty minutes. 

If these directions are followed, you will obtain sweet, tender and wholesome 
bread. If by any mistake the dough becomes sour before you are ready to bake 
it, you can rectify it by adding a httle dry supercarbonate of soda, molding the 
dough a long time to distribute the soda equally throughout the mass. All 
bread is better, if naturally sweet, without the soda; but sour bread you should 
never eat, if you desire good health. 

Keep well covered in a tin box or large stone crock, which should be wiped 
out every day or two, and scalded and dried thoroughly in the sun once a week. 

COMPRESSED YEAST BREAD. 
Use for two loaves of bread three quarts of sifted fiour, nearly a quart of 
warm water, a level tablespoonful of salt, and an ounce of compressed yeast. 



214 BREAD. 

Dissolve the yeast in a pint of lukewarm water; then stir into it enough flour to 
make a thick batter. Cover the bowl containing the batter or sponge with a 
thick folded cloth, and set it in a warm place to rise; if the temperature of heat 
is properly attended to, the sponge wiU be foamy and hght in half an hour. 
Now stir into this sponge the salt dissolved in a httle warm water, add the rest 
of the flour and sufficient warm water to make the dough stiff enough to knead; 
then knead it from five to ten minutes, divide it into loaves, knead again each 
loaf and put them into buttered baking- tins; cover them with a doubled thick 
cloth, and set again in a warm place to rise twice their height, then bake the 
same as any bread. This bread has the advantage of that made of home-made 
yeast as it is made inside of three hours, whereas the other requires from twelve 
to fourteen hours. 

HOME-MADE YEAST. 

Bofl. six large potatoes in three pints of water. Tie a handful of hops in a 
small musUn bag and boU. with the potatoes; when thoroughly cooked drain the 
water on enough flour to make a thin batter; set this on the stove or range and 
scald it enough to cook the flour, (this makes the yeast keep longer); remove it 
from the fire, and when cool enough, add the potatoes mashed, also haK a cup 
of sugar, half a tablespoonful of ginger, two of salt and a teacupful of yeast. 
Let it stand in a warm place until it has thoroughly risen, then put it in a large 
mouthed jug, and cork tightly; set away in a cool place. The jug should be 
scalded before putting in the yeast. 

Two-thirds of a coffeecupful of this yeast will make four loaves. 

UNRIVALED YEAST. 

On one morning boU two ounces of the best hops in four quarts of .v^ater half 
an hour; strain it, and let the hquor cool to the consistency of new milk; then 
put it in an earthen bowl, and add half a cupful of salt, and half a cupful of 
brown sugar; beat up one quart of flour with some of the liquor; then mix aU 
well together, and let it stand tfll the third day after; then add six medium- 
sized potatoes, boiled and mashed through a colander; let it stand a day, then 
strain and bottle, and it is fit for use. It must be stirred frequently while it is 
making, and kept near a fire. One advantage of this yeast is its spontaneous 
fermentation, requiring the help of no old yeast; if care be taken to let it fer- 
ment well in the bowl, it may immediately be corked tightly. Be careful to 
keep it in a cool place. Before using it shake the bottle up well. It wfll keep 
in a cool place two months, and is best the latter part of the time. Use about 
the same quantity as of other yeast. , 



BREAD. 215 

DRIED YEAST OR YEAST CAKES. 

Make a pan of yeast the same as " Home-made Yeast;" mix in with it corn- 
meal that has been sifted and dried, kneading it well, until it is thick enough to 
roU out, when it can be cut into cakes or crumble up. Spread out and dry thor- 
oughly in the shade; keep in a dry place. 

V/hen it is convenient to get compressed yeast, it is much better and cheaper 
than to make your own, a saving of time and trouble. Almost all groceries keep 
it, dehvered to them fresh made daily. 

SALT-RAISING BREAD. 

"While getting lareakfast in the morning, as soon as the tea-kettle has boiled, 
take a quart tin cup or an earthen quart milk pitcher, scald it, then fill one-third 
fuU of water about as warm as the finger could be held in; then to this add a 
teaspoonful of salt, a pinch of brown sugar and coarse flour enough to make a 
batter of about the right consistency for griddle-cakes. Set the cup, with the 
spoon in it, in a closed vessel half -filled with water, moderately hot, but not 
scalding. Keep the temperatiu-e as nearly even as possible, and add a teaspoon- 
ful of flour once or twice rluring the process of fermentation. The yeast ought 
to reach to the top of the bowl in about five hours. Sift your flour into a pan, 
make an opening in the centre, and pour in your yeast. Have ready a pitcher 
of warm milk, salted, or milk and water, (not too hot, or you wiU scald the yeast 
germs,) and stir rapidly iuto a pulpy mass with a spoon. Cover this sponge 
closely, and keep warm for an hour, then knead into loaves, adding flour to 
make the proper consistency. Place in warm, weU-greased pans, cover closely, 
and leave tiU it is hght. Bake in a steady oven, and when done let aU the hot 
steam escape. Wrap closely in damp towels, and keep in closed earthen jars 
until it is wanted. 

This in our grandmothers' time used to be considered the prize bread, on 
account of its being sweet and wholesome, and required no prepared yeast to 
make it. Nowadays yeast-bread is made with very little trouble, as the yeast 
can be procured at almost any grocery. 

BREAD FROM MILK YEAST. 

At noon the day before baking, take half a cup of corn-meal, and pour over 
it enough sweet milk boiling hot to make it the thickness of batter-cakes. In 
the winter place it where it will keep warm. The next morning before break- 
fast DOur into a pitcher a pint of boiling water; add one teaspoonful of soda and

one of salt. When cool enough' so that it will not scald the flour/ add enough to 
make a stiff batter; then add the cup of meal set the day before. This will be 
f uU of Uttle bubbles. Then place the pitcher in a kettle of warm water, cover the 
top with a folded towel and put it where it will keep warm, and you will be sur- 
prised to find how soon the yeast wiU be at the top of the pitcher. Then pour 
the yeast into a bread-pan; add a pint and a half of warm water, pr half water 
and half milk, and flour enough to knead into loaves. Knead but Uttle 
harder than for biscuit, and bake as soon as it rises to the top of the tin. This 
recipe makes five large loaves. Do not allow it to get too light before baking, 
for it will make the bread dry and crumbling. A cup of this milk yeast iS' excel- 
lent to raise buckwheat cakes. 

GRAHAM BREAD. 

One teacupful of wheat flour, one-half teacupful of Porto Rico molasses, one 
half cupful of good yeast, one teaspoonful of salt, one pint of warm water; add 
sufficient Graham flour to make the dough as stiff as can be stirred with a 
strong spoon; this is to be mixed at night; in the morning, add one teaspoonful 
of soda, dissolved in a httle water; mix well, and pour into two medium-sized 
pans; they vdU be about half full; let it stand in a warm place until it rises to 
the top of the pans, then bake one hour ia a pretty hot oven. 

This should be covered about twenty minutes when first put into the oven 
with a thick brown paper, or an old tin cover; it prevents the upper crust 
hardening before the loaf is well- risen. If these directions are correctly fol- 
lowed the bread wiU not be heavy or sodden, as it has been tried for years and 
never failed. 

GRAHAM BREAD. (Unfermented.) 

Stir together three heaping teaspoonfuls of baking powder, three cups of 
G-raham flour, and one^cup of white flour; then add a large teaspoonful of salt 
and half a cup of sugar. Mix all thoroughly with milk or water into as stiff a 
batter as can be stirred with a spoon. If water is used, a lump of butter as large 
as a walnut may be melted and stirred into it. Bake immediately in well- 
greased pans. 

BOSTON BROWN BREAD. 

One pint of rye flour, one quart of corn-meal, one teacupful of Graham flour, 
all fresh; half a teacupful of molasses or brown sugar, a teaspoonful of salt, and 
two-thirds of a teacupful of home-made yeast. Mix into as stiff a dough as ca,n 
be stirred with a spoon using warm water for wetting. Let it riSe several horns,

BOSTON BROWN BREAD. (Unfermehted). 

One cupful of rye flour, two cupfuls of corn-meal, one cupful of white flour, 
half a teacupful of molasses or sugar, a teaspoonful of salt. Stir all together 
thoroughly, and wet up with sour milk; then add a level teaspoonful of soda dis- 
solved in a tablespoonful of water. The same can be made of sweet nulk, by 
substituting baking-powder for soda. The batter to be stirred as thick as can be 
■vyith a spoon, and turned into well-greased pans. 

VIRGINIA BROWN BREAD. 

One pint of corn-meal, pour over enough boiling water to thoroughly scald it; 
when cool, add one pint of Ught, white bread sponge, mix well together, add one 
cupful of molasses, and Graham flour enough to mold; this will make two 
loaves; when hght, bake in a moderate oven one and a half hours. 

RHODE ISLAND BROWN BREAD. 
Two and one-half cupfuls of corn-meal, one and one-half cupfuls of rye-meal, 
one egg, one cup of molasses, two teaspoonf uls of cream of tartar, one teaspoon- 
ful of soda, a little salt and one quart of milk. Bake in a covered dish, either 
earthen or iron, in a inoderately hot oven three hours. 

STEAMED BROWN BREAD. 

One cup of white flour, two of Graham flour, two of Indian meal, one tea- 
spoonful of soda, one cup of molasses, three and a half cups of milk, a little salt. 
Beat well and steam for four hours. This is for sour milk; when sweet milk 
is used, use baking powder in place of soda. 

This is improved by setting it into the oven fifteen minutes after it is slipped 
from the mold. To be eaten warm with butter. Most excellent. 

RYE BREAD. 

To a quart of warm water stir as much wheat flour as will make a smooth 

batter; stir into it half a gUl of home-made yeast, and set it in a warm place to 

rise; this is called setting a sponge; let it be mixed in some vessel which will 

contain twice the quantity; in the morning, put three pounds and a half of rye

flour into a bowl or tray, make a hollow in the centre, pour ia the sponge, add a 
dessertspoonful of salt, and half a small teaspoonful of soda, dissolved in 
a little water; make the whole into a smooth dough, with as much warm water 
as may be necessary; knead it weU, cover it, and let it set in a warm place for 
three hours; then knead it again, and make it into two or three loaves; bake in 
a quick oven one hour, if made in two loaves, or less if the loaves are smaller. 

RYE AND CORN BREAD. 

One quart of rye meal or rye flour, two quarts of Indian meal, scalded (by 
placing in a pan and pouring over it just enough boiling water to merely wet it, 
but not enough to make it into a batter, stirring constantly with a spoon), one- 
half cup of molasses, two teaspoonfuls salt, one teacup yeast; make it as stiff as 
can be stirred with a spoon, mixing with warm water, and let rise all night. In 
the morning add a level teaspoonful of soda dissolved iu a httle water; then put 
it in a large pan, smooth the top with the hand dipped in cold water; let it stand 
a short time, and bake five or six hours. If put in the oven late in the day, let 
it remain all night. 

Graham may be used instead of rye, and baked as above. 

This is similar to the " Rye and Injun " of our grandmothers' days, but that 
was placed in a kettle, allowed to rise, then placed in a covered iron pan upon 
the hearth before the fire, with coals heaped upon the hd, to bake aU night. 

FRENCH BREAD. 

Beat together one pint of milk, four tablespoonfuls of melted butter, or half 
butter and half lard, half a cupful of yeast, one teaspoonful of salt and two eggs. 
Stir into this two quarts of flour. When this dough is risen, make into two 
large roUs, and bake as any bread. Out across the top diagonal gashes just be- 
fore putting into the oven. 

TWIST BREAD. 

Let the bread be made as directed for wheat bread, then take three pieces as 
large as a piut bowl each; strew a little flour over the paste-board or table, roU 
each piece under your hands, to twelve inches length, making it smaller in cir- 
cumference at the ends than in the middle; having rolled the three in this way, 
take a baking-tin, lay one part on it, join one end of each of the other two to it, 
and braid them together the length of the roUs, and join the ends by pressing 
them together; dip a ^rush in milk, and pass it over the top of the loaf; after 
ten minutes or so, ''et it in a quick oven, and bake for nearly an hour.

NEW ENGLAND CORN CAKE. 

One quart of milk, one pint of corn-meal, one teacupful of wheat flour, a tea- 
spoonful, of salt, two tablespoonfuls of melted butter. Scald the milk, and grad- 
ually pour it on the meal; when cool, add the butter and salt, also a half cup of 
yeast. Do this at night; in the morning beat thoroughly and add two well- 
beaten eggs, and a half teaspoonful of soda, dissolved in a spoonful of water. 
Pour the mixture into buttered deep earthen plates, let it stand fifteen minutes 
to rise again, then bake from twenty to thirty minutes. 

GERMAN BREAD. 
One pint of milk weU-boiled, one teacupful of sugar, two tablespoonfuls of 
aice lard or butter, two-thirds of a teacupful of baker's yeast. Make a rising 
with the milk and yeast; when Ught, mix in the sugar and shortening, with 
flour enough to make as soft a dough as can be handled. Flour the paste-board 
well, roU out about one-half inch thick; put this quantity into two large pans; 
make about a dozen indentures with the finger on the top; put a small piece of 
butter in each, and sift over the whole one tablespoonful of sugar mixed with 
one teaspoonful of cinnamon. Let this stand for a second rising; when per- 
fectly hght, bake in a quick oven fifteen or twenty minutes. 

CORN BREAD. 
Two cups of sifted meal, half a cup of flour, two cups of sour milk, two well- 
beaten eggs, half a cup of molasses or sugar, a teaspoonful of salt, two table- 
spoonfuls of melted butter. Mix the meal and flour smoothly and gradually 
with the milk, then the butter, molasses, and salt, then the beaten eggs, and 
lastly dissolve a level teaspoonful of baking-soda in a little milk and beat thor- 
oughly aU together. Bake nearly an hour in weU-buttered tins, not very shallow. 
This recipe can be made with sweet mflk by using baking-powder in place of soda.

VIRGINIA CORN BREAD. 

Three cups of white com- meal, one cup of flour, one tablespoonful of sugar, 
one teaspoonful of salt, two heaping teaspoonfuls of baking-powder, one table- 
spoonful of lard, three cups of milk and three eggs. Sift together the flour, com, 
meal, sugar, salt and baking-powder; rub in the lard cold, add the eggs weU- 
beaten and then the milk. Mix into a moderately stiff batter; pour it into 
w^-greased, shallow baking-pans, (pie-tins are suitable). Bake from thirty to 
forty minutes. 



220 BREAD. 

BOSTON CORN BREAD. 

One cup of sweet milk, two of sour milk, two-thirds of a cup of molasses, 
one of wheat flour, four of com-meal and one teaspoonful of soda; steam for 
three hours, and brown a few minutes in the oven. The same made of sweet 
milk and baking-powder is equally as good. 

INDIAN LOAF CAKE. 

Mix a teacupful of powdered white sugar with a quart of rich milk, and cut 
up in the milk two ounces of butter, adding a saltspoonful of salt. Put this 
mixture into a corered pan or skillet, and set it on the fire tiU it is scalding hot. 
Then take it off, and scald with it as much yellow Indian meal (previously sifted) 
as wiU make it of the consistence of thick boiled mush. Beat the whole very 
hard for a quarter of an hour, and then set it away to cool. 

WhUe it is cooling, beat three eggs very light, and stir them gradually into 
the mixture when it is about as warm as new milk. Add a teacupful of good 
strong yeast, and beat the whole another quarter of an hour, for much of the 
goodness of this cake depends on its being long and weU-beaten. Then have 
ready a tin mold or earthen pan with a pipe in the centre, (to diffuse the heat 
through the middle of the cake). The pan must be very weU-buttered, as Indian 
meal is apt to stick. Put in the mixtvue, cover it, and set it in a warm place to 
rise. It should be light in about fom* hours. Then bake it two hours in a 
moderate oven. When done, turn it out with the broad surface downwards, 
ahd send it to table hot and whole. Cut it into sHces and eat it with butter. 

This win be found an excellent cake. If wanted for breakfast, mix it, and 
set it to rise the night before. If properly made, standing aU night wiU not 
injure it. Lake aU Indian cakes, (of which this is one of the best), it should be 

eaten warm.

JOHNNIE CAKE. 

Sift one quart of Indian meal into a pan; make a hole in the middle and pour 

in a pint of warm water, adding one teaspoonful of salt; with a spoon mix the 

meal and water gradually into a soft dough; stir it very briskly for a quarter of 

an hour or more, tiU it becomes hght and spongy; then spread thie dough smooth 

and evenly on a straight, flat board (a piece* of the head of a flomr-barrel will 

serve for this purpose); place the board nearly upright before an open fire, and 

put an iron against the back to support it; bake it well; when done, cut it in 

squares; send it hot to table, spUt and buttered.

SPIDER CORN-CAKE. 
Beat two eggs and one-fourth cup sugar together. Then add one cup sweet 
milk, and one cup of sour milk in which you have dissolved one teaspoonf ul 
soda. Add a teaspoonful of salt. Then mix one and two-thirds cups of granu- 
lated corn-meal and one-third cup flour with this. Put a spider or skillet on the 
range, and when it is hot melt in two tablespoonfuls of butter. Turn the spider 
so that the butter can run up on the sides of the pan. Pour in the corn-cake 
mixture and add one more cup of sweet milk, but do not stir afterwards. Put 
this in the oven and bake from twenty to thirty-five minutes. When done, there 
should be a streak of custard through it. 

SOUTHERN CORN-MEAL PONE OR CORN DODGERS. 

Mix with cold water into a soft dough one quart of southern corn-meal, 
sifted, a teaspoonful of salt, a tablespoonful of butter or lard melted. Mold 
into oval cakes with the hands and bake in a very hot oven, in weU-greased 
pans. To be eaten hot. The crust should be brown. 

RAISED POTATO-CAKE. 

Potato-cakes, to be served with roast lamb or with game, are made of equal 
quantities of mashed potatoes and of flou^ say one quart of each, two table- 
spoonfuls of butter, a little salt, and milk enough to make a batter as for griddle- 
cakes; to this allow half a teacupful of fresh yeast; let it rise till it is hght and 
bubbles of air form; then dissolve half a teaspoonful oL^oda in a spoonful of 
warm water and add to the batter; bake in muffin tins. These are good also 
with fricasseed chicken; take them from the tins and drop in the gravy just 
before sending to the table. 



Biscuits, IRolls, Hbuffins, Etc. 

GENERAL SUGGESTIONS. 

In making batter -cakes, the ingredients should be put together over night to 
rise, and the eggs and butter added in the morning; the butter melted and eggs 
well-beaten. If the batter appears sour in the least, dissolve a Uttle soda and 
stir into it; this should be done early enough to rise some time before baking. 

Water can be used in place of milk in all raised dough, and the dough should 
be thoroughly hght before making into loaves or bisowits; then when molding 



222 BREAD— BISCUITS, ROLLS, MUFFINS, ETC. 

them, use as little flour as possible; the kneading to be done when first made 
from the sponge, and should be done well and for some length of time, as this 
makes the pores fine, the bread cut smooth and tender. Care should be taken 
not to get the dough too stiff. 

Where any recipe caUs for baking-powder, and you do not have it, you can 
use cream-tartar and soda, ia the proportion of one level teaspoonful of soda to 
two of cream-tartar. 

When the recipe calls for sweet milk or cream, and you do not have it, you 
may use in place of it sour milk or cream, and, in that case, baking-powder or 
cream of tartar must not be used, but baking-soda, using a level teaspoonful to 
a quart of sour raOk; the milk is always best when just turned, so that it is 
solid, and not sour enough to whey or to be watery. 

When making biscuits or bread with baking-powder or soda and cream 
tartar, the oven should be prepared first; the dough handled quickly and put 
into the oven immediately, as soon as it becomes the proper lightness, to ensure 
good success. If the oven is too slow, the article baked will be heavy and hard. 

As in beating cake, never stir ingredients into batter, but beat them in, by 
beating down from the bottom, and up, and over again. This laps the air into 
the batter, which produces httle air-cells and causes the dough to puff and swell 
as it comes in contact with the heat while cooking. 

TO RENEW STALE ROLLS. 

To freshen stale biscuits or rolls, put them into a steamer for ten minutes, 
then dry them off in a hot oven; or dip each roll for an instant in cold water and 
heat them crisp in the oven. 

WARM BREAD FOR BREAKFAST. 

Dough, after it has become once sufficiently raised and perfectly hght, cannot 
afterwards be injvired by setting aside in any cold place where it cannot freeze; 
therefore, biscuits, roUs, etc., can be made late the day before wanted for break- 
fast. Prepare them ready for baking by molding them out late in the evening; 
lay them a little apart on buttered tins; cover the tins with a cloth, then fold 
around that a newspaper, so as to exclude ' the air, as that has a tendency to 
cause the crust to be hard and thick when baked. The best place in summer 
is to place them in the ice-box, then all you have to do in the morning (an hour 
before breakfast time, and while the oven is heating) is to bring them from 
the ice-box, take off the cloth and warm it, and place it over them again; then 
set the tins in a warm place near the fire. This will give them time to rise and 



BREAD— BISCUITS, ROLLS, MUIFINS, ETC. 223 

bake when needed. If these directions are followed rightly, you wiU find it 
makes no difference with their Ughtness and goodness, and you can always be 
sure of warm raised biscuits for breakfast in one hour's time. 

Stale roUs may be made light and flakey by dipping for a moment in cold 
water, and placing immediately in a very hot oven to be made crisp and hot. 

SODA BISCUIT. 

One quart of sifted flour, one teaspoonful of soda, two teaspoonfuls of cream 
tartar, one teaspoonful of salt; mix thoroughly, and rub in two tablespoonfuls 
of butter, and wet with one pint of sweet milk. Bake in a quick oven. 

BAKING-POWDER BISCUIT. 

Two pints of flour, butter the size of an egg, three heapiag teaspoonfuls ot 
baking-powder, and one teaspoonful of salt; make a soft dough of sweet milk or 
water, knead as little as possible, cut out with the usual biscuit-cutter and bake 
in rather a quick oven. 

SOUR MILK BISCUIT. 

Eub into a quart of sifted flour a piece of butter the size of an egg, one tea. 
spoonful of salt; stir into this a pint of sour milk, dissolve one teaspoonful of 
soda, and stir iuto the milk just as you add it to the flour; knead it up quickly, 
roll it out nearly half an inch thick, and cut out with a biscuit-cutter; bake im- 
mediately in a quick oven. 

Very nice biscuit may be made with sour cream without the butter by the 
same process. 

RAISED BISCUIT. 

Sift two quarts of flour in a mixing-pan, make a hole in the middle of the 
flour, pour into this one pint of warm water or new mUk, one teaspoonful 1 of 
salt, half a cup of melted lard or butter, stir in a little flour, then add half a cup- 
ful of yeast, after which stir in as much flour as you can conveniently with 
your hand, let it rise over night; in the morning add nearly a teaspoonful of 
soda, and more flour as is needed to make a rather soft dough; then mold flf> 
teen to twenty minutes, the longer the better; let it rise until light again, roD 
this out about half an inch thick, and cut out with a biscuit-cutter, or make it 
into little balls with your hands; cover and set in a warm place to rise. When 
Ught, bake a hght brown in a moderate oven. Rub a Uttle warm butter or sweet 
lard on the sides of the biscuits when you place them on the tins, to pr-evenl 
their sticking together when baked.

LIGHT BISCUIT. No. I. 

Take a piece of bread dough that will make about as many biscuits as you 
wish; lay it out rather flat in a bowl; break into it two eggs; half a cup of 
sugar, half a cup of butter; mix this thoroughly with enough flour to keep it 
from sticking to the hands and board. Knead it well for about fifteen or twenty 
minutes, make into small biscuits, place in a greased pan, and let them rise until 
about even with the top of the pan. Bake in a quick oven for about half an 
hour. 

These can be made in the form of rolls, which some prefer. 

LIGHT BISCUIT. No. 2. 

When you bake take a pint of sponge, one tablespoonful of melted butter, 
one tablespoonful of sugar, the white of one egg beaten to a foam. Let rise un 
til light, mold into biscuits, and when hght bake. 

GRAHAM BISCUITS, WITH YEAST. 

Take one pint of water or milk, one large tablespoonful of butter, two table- 
spoonfuls of sugar, a half cup of yeast, and a pinch of salt; take enough wheat 
flour to use up the water, making it the consistency of batter-cakes; add the rest 
of the ingredients and as much Graham flomr as can be stirred in with a spoon; 
set it away till morning; in the morning, grease a pan, flour your hands, take a 
lump of dough the size of an egg, roll it lightly between the palms of your 
hands, let them rise twenty minuteSj and bake in a tolerably hot- oven. 

EGG BISCUIT. 
Sift together a quart of dry flour and three heaping teaspoonfuls of baking- 
powder. Eub into this thoroughly a piece of butter the size of an egg; add two 
well-beaten eggs, a tablespoonful of sugar, a teaspoonfiil of salt. Mix all to- 
gether quickly into a soft dough, with one cup of milk, or more if needed. Roll 
out nearly half of an inch thick. Cut into biscuits, and bake immediately in a 
quick oven from fifteen to twenty minutes. 

PARKER HOUSE ROLLS. 

One pint of milk, boiled and cooled; a piece of butter the size of an egg; on/*- 
half cupful of fresh yeast; one tablespoonful of sugar, one pinch of salt, and two 
quarts of sifted flour. 

Melt the butter in the warm milk, then add the sugar, salt and flour, and let 
it rise over night. Mix rather soft. In the morning, add to this half of a tea- 



BREAD— BISCUITS, ROLLS, MUFFJ-NS, ETC. 225 

spoonful of soda dissolved in a spoonful of water. Mix in enough flour to make 
the same stiffness as any biscuit dough; roll out not more than a quarter of an 
inch thick. Cut with a large round cutter; spread soft butter over the tops and 
fold onehaLE over the other by doubUng it. Place them apart a Uttle so that 
there wHl be room to rise. Cover, and place them near the fire for fifteen or 
twenty minutes before baking. Bake in rather a quick oven. 

PARKER HOUSE ROLLS. (Unfermented.) 

These rolls are made with baking-powder, and are much sooner made, althotigh 
the preceding recipe is the old original one from the "Parker House." Stir 
into a quart of sifted flour three large teaspoonf uls of baking-powder, a table- 
spoonful of cold butter, a teaspoonful of salt and one of sugar, and a well-beaten 
egg; rub aU well into the flour, pour iu a pint of cold milk, mix up quickly into 
a smooth dough, roll it out less than half an inch thick, cut with a large biscuit- 
cutter, spread soft butter over the top of each, fold one half over the other by 
doubling it, lay them a Uttle apart on greased tins. Set them immediately in a 
pretty hot oven. Eub over the tops with sweet milk before putting in the oven, 
to give them a glaze. 

FRENCH ROLLS. 
Three cups of sweet milk, one cup of butter and lard, mixed in equal propor- 
tions, one-half cup of good yeast, or half a cake of compressed yeast, and a tea- 
spoonful of salt. Add flour enough to make a stiff dough. Let it rise over 
night; in the morning, add two well-beaten eggs; knead thoroughly, and let it 
rise again. With the hands, make it into balls as large as an egg; then roU be- 
tween the hands to make long rolls, (about three inches.) Place close together 
in even rows on weU-buttered pans. Cover and let them rise again, then bake 
in a quick oven to a delicate brown. 

BEATEN BISCUIT. 

Two quarts of sifted flour, a teaspoonful of salt, a tablespoonful of sweet Iard» 
one egg; make up with half a pint of milk, or, if milk is not to be had, plain 
water will answer; beat well until the dough bUsters and cracks; puU off a two- 
inch square of the dough; roll it into a baU with the hand; flatten, stick with a 
fork, and bake in a quick oven. 

It is not beating hard that makes the biscuit nice, but the regularity of the 
motion. Beating hard, the old cooks say, kills the dough. An old-fashioned, 
Southern recipe. 



226 BREAD— BISCUITS, ROLLS, MUFFINS, ETC. 

POTATO BISCUIT. 

Boil six good-sized potatoes with their jackets on; take them out with a 
skimmer, drain and squeeze with a towel to ensure being dry; then remove the 
skin, mash them perfectly free from lumps, add a tablespoonful of butter, one 
egg, and a pint of sweet milk. When cool, beat in half a cup of yeast. Put in 
just enough flour to make a stiff dough. When this rises, make into small 
cakes. Let them rise the same as biscuit and bake a delicate brown. 

This dough is very fine, dropped into meat soups for pot-pie. 

VINEGAR BISCUITS. 
Take two quarts of flour, one large tablespoonful of lard or butter, one table- 
spoonful and a half of vinegar and one teaspoonful of soda; put the soda in the

biscuit-cutter one inch thick, and bake in a quick oven. 

GRAFTON MILK BISCUITS. 

Boil and mash two white potatoes; add two teaspoonfuls of brown sugar; 
pour boiling water over these, enough to soften them. When tepid, add one 
small teacupful of yeast; when light, warm three ounces of butter in one pint of 
milk, a httle salt, a third of a teaspoonful of soda, and flour enough to make stiff 
sponge; when risen, work it on the board; put it back in the tray to rise again; 
when risen, roU into cakes, and let them stand half an hour. Bake in a quick 
oven. These biscuits are fine. 

SALLY LUNN. 

Warm one- half cupful of butter in a pint of milk; add a teaspoonful of salt, 
a tablespoonful of sugar, and seven cupfuls of sifted flour; beat thoroughly, and 
when the mixture is blood warm, add four beaten eggs, and last of all, half a 
cup of good lively yeast. Beat hard until the batter breaks in bKsters. Set it to 
rise over night. In the morning, dissolve half a teaspoonful of soda, stir it into 
'the batter and \\\ra. 't into a weU-buttered, shallow dish to rise again about fif- 
teen or twenty minutes. Bake about fifteen to twenty minutes. 

The cake shotdd be torn apart, not cut; cutting with a knife makes warm 
bread heavy. Bake a hght brown. This cake is frequently seen on Southern 
tables. 

SALLY LUNN. (Unfermented.) 

Eub a piece of butter as large as an egg into a quart of flour; add a timabler

as a sponge over night. In the morning, add half a cup of melted butter, one 
cup of sugar, half a nutmeg grated, one saltspoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful 
of soda, and flour enough to roU out hke biscuit. Knead weU and set to rise for 
five hours. EoU the dough half an inch thick; cut in round cakes, and lay in 
rows in a buttered baking-pan, and let the cakes stand half an hour; or mitil 
hght; then put them in the oven, having first made a deep cross on each with 
a knife. Bake a light brown, and brush over with white of egg beaten stiff with 
powdered sugar. 

RUSKS, WITH YEAST. 

In one large coffee-cup of warm mUk, dissolve half a cake of compressed 
yeast, or three tablespoonfuls of home-made yeast; to this add three well-beaten 
eggs, a small cup of sugar, and a teaspoonful of salt; beat these together. 
Use flour enough to make a smooth, hght dough, let it stand until very hght, 
then knead it in the form of biscuits; place them on buttered tins, and let them 
rise until they are almost up to the edge of the tins; pierce the top of each one, 
and bake in a quick oven. Glaze the tops of each with sugar and mflk, or the 
white of an egg, before baking. Some add dried currants, v>rell-washed and 
dried in the oven. 

RUSKS. 

Two cups of raised dough, one of sugar, half a cup of butter, two well -beaten 
eggs, flour enough to make a stiff dough; set to rise, and when hght, mold into

Bake immediately. 

SCOTCH SCONES 

Thoroughly mix, while dry, one quart of sifted flour, loosely measured, with 
two heaping teaspoonfuls of baking-powder; then rub into it a tablespoonful of 
cold butter, and a teaspoonful of salt. Be sure that the butter is well worked 
m. Add sweet milk enough to make a very soft paste. EoU out the paste about 
a quarter of an inch thick, using plenty of flour on the paste-board, and roUing- 
pin. Cut it into triangular pieces, each side about four inches long. Flour the 
sides and bottom of a biscuit-tin, and place the pieces on it. Bake immediately 
in a quick oven from twenty to thirty minutes. When half done, brjish over 
with sweet rmlk. Some cooks prefer to bake them on a floured griddle, and cut 
them a round shape the size of a saucer, then scarred across to form four 
quarters. " "^ 

CRACKNELS. 

Two cups of rich niitk, four tablespoonfuls of butter and a gill of yeast, a 
teaspoonful of salt; mix warm, add flour enough to make a light dough. When 
light, roll thin, and cut in long pieces three iaches wide, prick well with a fork, 
and bake in a slow oven. They are to be mixed rather hard, and rolled very 
thin, Uke soda crackers. 

RAISED MUFFINS. No. I. 

Make a batter of one pint of sweet milk, one teaspoonful of sugar, one of 
salt, a tablespoonful of butter or sweet lard, and a half cup of yeast; add flour 
enough to make it moderately thick; keep it in a warm, not hot, place, until it is 
quite light, then stir in one or two weU-beaten eggs, and half a teaspoonful of 
soda, dissolved in a little warm water. liet the batter stand twenty-five or thirty 
minutes longer to rise a little, tiun into well-greased mufftn-rings or gem-pans, 
and bake in a quick oven. 

To be served hot, and torn open, instead of cut with a knife.

other ingredients; if the muffins are wanted for luncheon, mix them about 
eight o'clock in the morning; if for breakfast, set them at ten o'clock at night; 
when ready for baking, stir in half a teaspoonful of soda, dissolved in a tea- 
spoonful of hot water; butter the muffin-ring or gem-irons, and bake in a quick 
oven.

lard cold, add the beaten eggs and milk; mix quickly into a smooth batter, a 
little firmer than for griddle-cakes. Grease weU some muffin-pans, and flU them 
two-thirds fvill. Bake in a hot oven fifteen or twenty minutes. These, made 
of cream, omitting the butter, are excellent. 

PLAIN MUFFINS. 

One egg, well-beaten, a tablespoonful of butter and a tablespoonful of sugar, 
with a teaspoonful of salt, all beaten until very hght. One cup of nulk, three 
of sifted flour, and three teaspoonfuls of baking-powder. One-half Graham and

and one of flour. 

Drop on weU-greasea patty-pans and bake twenty minutes in a rather quick 
oven, or bake on a griddle in mufi&n-rings. 

MUFFINS WITHOUT EGGS. 

One quart of buttermilk, a teaspoonful of soda dissolved in the mUk, a little 
salt, and flom* enough to make a stiff batter. Drop in hot gem-pans and bake 
in a quick oven. Two or three tablespoonfuls of sour cream will make them a 
little richer. 

TENNESSEE MUFFINS.

fvd of brown sugar, one of melted lard or butter, one or two beaten eggs; to the 
egg add the nulk, then the sugar and salt, then the Graham flour (with the soda 
mixed in), together with the lard or butter; make a stiff batter, so that it will 
drop, not pour, from the spoon. Have the gem-pans very hot, fill and bake fif 
teen minutes in a hot oven. 

The same can be made of sweet milk, using three teaspoonfuls of baking 
powder instead of soda, and if you use sweet milk, put in no shortening. Ex 
cellent. 

Muffins of aU kinds should only be cut just around the edge, then pulled 
open with the fingers. 

PLAIN GRAHAM GEMS. 

Two cupfuls of the best Graham meal, two of water, fresh and cold, or milk 
and water, and a Uttle salt. Stir briskly for a minute or two. Have the gem-

heat a little when they are nearly done. As the best-prepared gems may be 
spoiled if the heat is not sufficient, care and judgment must be used in order to 
secure this most healthful as weU as dehcious bread. 

WAFFLES. 

Take a quart of flour and wet it with a little sweet milk that has been boiled 
and cooled, then stir in enough of the nulk to form a thick batter. Add a 
tablespoonful of melted butter, a teaspoonful of salt, and yeast to raise it. When 
hght, add two weU-beaten eggs, heat your waffle-iron, grease it weU, and fill it 
with the batter. Two or three minutes will suffice to bake on one side; then 
turn the iron over; and when brown on both sides, the cake is done. Serve 
immediately. 

CONTINENTAL HOTEL WAFFLES. 

Put into one quart of sifted flour three teaspoonfuls of baking-powder, one 
teaspoonful of salt, one of sugar, all thoroughly stirred and sifted together; add 
a tablespoonful of melted butter, six weU-beaten eggs, and a pint of sweet milk; 
cook in wafifle-irons, heated and weU-greased. Serve hot. 

NEWPORT WAFFLES. 

Make one pint of Indian meal into mush in the usual way. While hot, put 
in a small lump of butter, and a dessertspoonful of salt. Set the mush aside to 
cool. MeanwhUe. beat separately tiU very hght the whites and yolks of four 
eggs. Add the eggs to the mush, and cream in gradually one quart of wheaten 
flour. Add half a pint of buttermilk or sour cream, in which has been dissolved 
half a teaspoonful of carbonate of soda. Lastly, bring to the consistency of thin 
batter, by the addition of sweet milk. Waffle-irons should be put on to heat an 
hour in advance, that they may be in the proper condition for baking as soon 
as the batter is ready. Have a brisk fire, butter the irons thoroughly, but with 
nicety, and bake quickly. Fill the irons only half full of batter, that the waffles 
may have room to rise. 

CREAM WAFFLES. 

One pint of sour cream, two eggs, one pint of flour, one tablespoonful of corn- 
meal, one teaspoonful of soda, half a teaspoonful of salt. Beat the eggs sepa- 
rately, mix the cream with the beaten yolks, stir in the flour, corn-meal and

RICE WAFFLES. No. 2. 

Rub through a sieve one pint of boiled rice, add it to a tablespoonful of dry- 
flour, two-thirds of a teaspoonful of salt, two teaspoonfuls of baking-powder. 
Beat separately the yolks and whites of three eggs; add to the yolks a cup and 
a half of rnflk, work it into the flour, then add an ounce of melted but- 
tei^; beat the white of eggs thoroughly; mix the whole together. Heat the 
waffle-iron and grease it evenly; pour the batter into the half of the iron over 
the range until nearly two-thirds full, cover, allow to cook a moment, then turn 
and brown slightly on the other side. 

GERMAN RICE WAFFLES. 

Bofl a half-pound of rice in mUk until it becomes thoroughly soft. Then 
remove it from the flre, stirring it constantly, and adding, a little at a time, one 
quart of sifted flom-, five beaten eggs, two spoonfuls of yeast, a half-pound of 
melted butter, a Uttle salt, and a teacupf ul of warm milk. Set the batter in a 
warm place, and when risen, bake in the ordinary way. 

BERRY TEA-CAKES. 

Nice httle tea-cakes to be baked in muffin-rings are made of one cup of sugar, 
two eggs, one and a half cups of mUk, one heaping teaspoonful of baking-powder, 
a piece of butter the size of an egg and flour sufficient to make a stiff batter. 
In this batter stir a pint bowl of fruit — any fresh are nice — or canned berries with 
the juice poured off. Serve while warm and they are a dainty addition to the 
tea-table. Eaten with butter. 

RYE DROP-CAKES.

BREAD— BISCUITS, ROLLS, MUFFINS, ETC. 233 

WHEAT DROP-CAKES. 

One pint of cream, six eggs well-beaten, a little salt, and wheat flour enough 
to make a thin batter; bake in little cups buttered, and in a hot oven fifteen 
minutes. 

POP-OVERS. 

Two cups of flour, two cups of sweet milk, two eggs, one teaspoonful of 
butter, one teaspoonfvQ of salt, bake in cups in a quick oven fifteen minutes. 
Serve hot with a sweet sauce. 

FLANNEL CAKES. (With Yeast.) 

Heat a pint of sweet milk, and into it put two heaping tablespoonfuls of 
butter, let it melt, then add a pint of cold milk and the well-beaten yolks of four 
eggs — placing the whites in a cool place; also, a teaspoonful of salt, four table- 
spoonfuls of home-made yeast, and sufficient flour to make a stiff batter; set it 
in a warm place to rise; let it stand three hours or over night; before baking 
add the beaten whites; bake like any other griddle-cakes. Be sure to make the 
batter stiff enough, for flom- must not be added after it has risen, unless it is 
allowed to rise again. These, half corn-meal and half wheat, are very nice. 

FEATHER GRIDDLE-CAKES. (With Yeast.) 

Make a batter, at night, of a pint of water or milk, a teaspoonful of salt, and 
half a teacupful of yeast; in the morning, add to it one teacupful of thick, sour 
milk, two eggs well-beaten, a level tablespoonful of melted butter, a level tea- 
spoonful of soda, and floiir enough to make the consistency of pan-cake batter; 
let stand twenty minutes, then bake. 

This is a convenient way, when making sponge for bread over night, using 
some of the sponge. 

WHEAT GRIDDLE-CAKES. 

Three cups of flour, one teaspoonful of salt, three teaspoonfuls of baking- 
powder sifted together; beat three eggs and add to three cupfuls of sweet milk, 
also a tablespoonful of melted butter; mix all into a smooth batter, as thick as 
wiU run in a stream from the hps of a pitcher. Bake on a well-greased, hot 
griddle, a nice, light brown. Very good. 

SOUR MILK GRIDDLE-CAKES. 

Make a batter of a quart of sour milk and as much sifted flour as is needed to 
thicken so that it Avill run from the dish; add two weU-beaten eggs, a teaspoon- 



234 BREAD— BISCUITS, ROLLS, MUFFINS, ETC. 

fui of salt, a tablespoonful of melted butter, and a level teaspoonful of soda dis- 
solved in a little milk or cold water, added last; then bake on a hot griddle, 
well greased, brown on both sides. 

CORN-MEAL GRIDDLE-CAKES. (With Yeast.) 
Stir into one quart of boihng milk three cups of corn-meal; after it cools, add 
one cup of white flour, a teaspoonful of salt, and three tablespoonfuls of home- 
made yeast. Mix this over night. In the morning, add one tablespoonful of 
melted butter or lard, two beaten eggs, and a teaspoonful of soda, dissolved in a 
little water. 

This batter should stand a few minutes, after adding the butter and soda, 
that it should have time to rise a Uttle; in the meantime, the griddle could be 
heating. Take a small stick hke a good-sized skewer, wind a bit of cloth around 
the end of it, fasten it by winding a piece of thread around that and tying it 
firm. Melt together a tablespoonful of butter and lard. Grease the griddle with 
this. Between each batch of cakes, wipe the griddle off with a clean paper or 
cloth, and grease afresh. Put the cakes on by spoonfuls, or pour them carefully 
from a pitcher, trying to get them as near the same size as possible. As soon as 
they begin to bubble aU over turn them, and cook on the other side tiU they 
stop puffing. The second lot always cooks better than the first, as the griddle 
becomes evenly heated. 

CORN-MEAL GRIDDLE-CAKES. 
Scald two cups of sifted meal, mix with a cup of wheat flour, and a teaspoon- 
ful of salt. Add three weU-beaten eggs; thin the whole with sour milk enough 
to make it the right consistency. Beat the whole till very light, and add a tea- 
spoonful of baking-soda dissolved in a httle water. If you use sweet mUk, use 
two tirge teaspoonfuls of baking-powder instead of soda. 

GRIDDLE-CAKES. (Very Good.) 
One quart of Graham flour, half a pint of Indian meal, one giU of yeast, a 
teaspoonful of salt; mix the flour and meal, pour on enough warm water to 
make batter rather thicker than that for buckwheat cakes; add the yeast, and 
when hght bake on griddle not too hot. 

GRAHAM GRIDDLE-CAKES. 

Mix together dry two cups of Graham flour, one cup wheat flom*, two heap, 
ing teaspoonfuls of baking-powder, and one teaspoonful of salt. Then add three 
eggs weU-beaten, one tablespoonful of lard or butter melted, and three cups of 
sweet mUk. Cook immediately on a hot griddle. 



BREAD— BISCUITS, ROLLS, MUFFINS, ETC. 235 

BREAD GRIDDLE-CAKES. 

One quart of milk, boiling hot; two cups fine bread-crumbs, three eggs, one 
tablespoonful melted butter, one-half teaspoonf ul salt, one-half teaspoonful soda, 
dissolved in warm water; break the bread into the boiling mUk, and let stand 
for ten minutes in a covered bowl, then beat to a smooth paste; add the yolks of 
the eggs well- whipped, the butter, salt, soda, and finally the whites of the eggs 
previously whipped stiff, and add half of a cupful of flour. These can also be 
made of sour milk, soaking the bread in it over night, and using a little more 
soda. 

RICE GRIDDLE-CAKES. 

Two cupfuls of cold boiled rice, one pint of flour, one teaspoonful sugar, one- 
half teaspoonful salt, one and one-half teaspoonfuls baking-powder, one egg, a 
httle more than half a pint of nulk. Sift together flour, sugar, salt and powder; 
add rice free from lumps, diluted with beaten egg and milk; mix into smooth 
batter. Have griddle weU-heated, make cakes large, bake nicely brown, and 
nerve with maple syrup. 

POTATO GRIDDLE-CAKES. 

Twelve large potatoes, three heaping tablespoonfuls of flour, one teaspoonful 
of baking-powder, one-half teaspoonful of salt, one or two eggs, two teacupfuls 
of boihng milk. The potatoes are peeled, washed and grated into a httle cold 
water, (which keeps them white), then strain off water and pour on boihng 
milk, stir in eggs, salt and flour, mixed with the baking-powder; if agreeable, 
flavor with a httle flne chopped onion; bake hke any other pan-cakes, allowing a 
httle more lard or butter. Serve with stewed or preserved fruit, especially with 
huckleberries. 

GREEN CORN GRIDDLE-CAKES. 

One pint of milk, two cups grated green com, a little salt, two eggs, a tea- 
spoonful of baking-powder, flour sufficient to make a batter to fry on the 
griddle. Butter them hot and serve. 

HUCKLEBERRY GRIDDLE-CAKES. 

Made the same as above, leaving out one cup of milk, adding one tablespoon- 
ful of sugar, and a pint of huckleberries, rolled iu flour. Blackberries or rasp- 
berries can be used in the same manner. 

FRENCH GRIDDLE-CAKES. 
Beat together, until smooth, six eggs and a pint sifted flour; melt one ounce 
of butter, and add to the batter, with one ounce of sugar and a cup of milk;, 

16 



236 BREAD— BISCUITS, ROLLS, MUFFINS, ETC. 

beat until smooth; put a tablespoonful at a time into a frying-pan, slightly 
greased, spreading the batter evenly over the surface by tipping the pan about; 
fry to a light brown; spread with jelly, roU up, dust with powdered sugar and 
serve hot. 

RAISED BUCKWHEAT CAKES. 

Take a small crock or large earthen pitcher, put into it a quart of warm 
water or half water and milk, one heaping teaspoonful of salt; then stir in as 
much buckwheat flour as will thicken it to rather a stiff batter; lastly add half a 
cup of yeast; make it smooth, cover it up warm to rise over night; in the morning, 
add a small, level teaspoonful of soda, dissolved in a httle warm water; this wiU 
remove any sour taste, if any, and increase the hghtness. 

Not a few object to eating buckwheat, as its tendency is to thicken the 
blood, and also to produce constipation; this can be remedied by making the 
batter one-third corn-meal and two-thirds buckwheat, which makes the cakes 
equally as good. Many prefer them in this way. 

BUCKWHEAT CAKES WITHOUT YEAST. 

Two cups of buckwheat flour, one of wheat flour, a httle salt, three tea- 
spoonfuls baking-powder; mix thoroughly, and add about equal parts of milk 
and water until the batter is of the right consistency, then stir until free from 
lumps. If they do not brown well, add a httle molasses, 

BUCKWHEAT CAKES. 

Half a pint of buckwheat flour, a quarter of a pint of corn-meal, a quarter of 
a pint of wheat flour, a httle salt, two eggs beaten very hght, one quart of new 
milk (made a httle warm, and mixed with the eggs before the flour is put in), 
one tablespoonful of butter or sweet lard, two large tablespoonf uls of yeast. Set 
it to rise at night for the morning. If in the least sour, stir in before baking 
just enough soda to correct the acidity. A very nice, but more expensive recipe. 

SWEDISH GRIDDLE-CAKES. 

One pint of white flour, sifted; six eggs, whites and yolks beaten separately 
to the utmost; one saltspoonful of salt; one saltspoonful of soda dissolved in 
vinegar; milk to make a thin batter.

and beaten whites alternatelv; thin with more nailk if necessary 



BREAD— BISCUITS, ROLLS, MUFFINS, ETC. 237 

CORN-MEAL FRITTERS. 

One pint of sour milk, one teaspoonful of salt, three eggs, one tablespoonful 
of molasses or sugar, one handful of flour, and corn-meal enough to make a 
stiff batter; lastly, stir in a small teaspoonful of soda, dissolved in a little warm 
water. 

This recipe is very nice made of rye flom*. 

CREAM FRITTERS. 
One cup of cream; five eggs — the whites only; two full cups prepared flour; 
one saltspoonful of nutmeg; a pinch of salt. Stir the whites into the cream in 
turn with the flour, put in nutmeg and salt, beat aU up hard for two minutes. 
The batter should be rather thick. Fry in plenty of hot, sweet lard, a spoonful 
of batter for each fritter. Drain, and serve upon a hot, clean na^pkin. Eat 
with jeUy sauce. Pull, not cut, them open. Very nice. 

CURRANT FRITTERS. 

Two cupftds dry, fine, bread-crumbs, two tablespoonfuls of prepared flour, 
two cups of nulk, one-half pound currants, washed and well-dried, five eggs 
whipped very light, one-half cup powdered sugar, one tablespoonful butter, on© 
half teaspoonfvil mixed cinnamon and nutmeg. Boil the milk and pour over 
the bread. Mix and put in the butter. Let it get cold. Beat in next the yolks 
and sugar, the seasoning, fiour, and stifif whites; finally, the currants dredged, 
whitely with flour. The batter should be thick. Drop in great spoonfuls into 
the hot lard and fry. Drain them and send hot to table. Eat with a mixture 
of wine and powdered sugar. 

WHEAT FRITTERS. 

Three eggs, one and a half cups of milk, three teaspoonfuls baking-powder, 
salt, and flour enough to make quite stiff, thicker than batter-cakes. Drop into 
hot lard and fry like doughnuts. 

A good Sauce for the Above. — One cup of sugar, two tablespoonfuls of butter, 
one teaspoonful of flour beaten together; half a cup boiling water; flavor with 
extract lemon and boil imtil clear. Or serve with maple syrup. 

APPLE FRITTERS. 

Make a batter in the proportion of one cup sweet milk to two cups flour, a 
heaping teaspoonful of baking-powder, two eggs beaten separately, one table- 
spoonful of sugar and a saltspoon of salt; heat the milk a httle more than milk- 



238 BREAD—BISCUITS, ROLLS, MUFFINS, ETC. 

warm; add it slowly to the beaten yolks and sugar; then add flour and whites 
of the eggs; stir all together and throw in thin shoes of good sour apples, dip- 
ping the batter up over them; drop into boihng hot lard in large spoonfuls with 
pieces of apple in each, and fry to a hght brown. Serve with maple syrup, or a 
nice syrup made with clarified sugar. 

Bananas, peaches, sUced oranges and other fruits can be used in the same 
batter. 

PINE-APPLE FRITTERS. 

Make a batter as for apple fritters; then pare one large pine-apple, cut it in 
shoes a quarter of an inch thick, cut the sUces in halves, dip them into the batter 
and fry them, and serve them as above. 

PEACH FRITTERS. 
Peel the peaches, spht each in two and take out the stones; dust a httle 
powdered sugar over them; dip each piece in the batter, and fry in hot fat. A 
sauce to be served with them may be made as foUows: Put an ounce of butter 
in a sauce-pan, and whisk it to a cream; add four ounces of sugar gradually. 
Beat the yolks of two eggs; add to them a dash of nutmeg and a gill each of 
cold water and rum; stir this into the luke-warm batter, and allow it to heat 
gradually. Stir constantly until of a smooth, creamy consistency, and serve. 
The batter is made as follows: Beat the yolks of three eggs; add to them a gill 
of mUk;, or half of a cupful, a saltspoonful of salt, four ounces of flour; mix. If 
old flour is used, a httle more mflk may be found necessary. 

GOLDEN-BALL FRITTERS. 

Put into a stew-pan a pint of water, a piece of butter as large as an egg, and 
a tablespoonful of sugar. When it boils, stir into it one pint of sifted flour, 
stirring briskly and thoroughly. Eemove from the fire, and when nearly 
cooled, beat into it six eggs, each one beaten separately, and added, one at a 
time, beating the batter between each. Drop the stiff dough into bofling lard by 
fceaspoonfuls. Eat with syrup, or melted sugar and butter flavored. 

Stirring the boiling lard around and aroimd, so that it whirls when you 
drop in the fritters, causes them to assmne a round shape like balls. 

CANNELONS, OR FRIED PUFFS. 

Half a pound of puflE paste; apricot, or any kind of preserve that may be 
preferred; hot lard. 

Cannelons, which are made of puff -paste, roUed very thin, with jam en- 
closed, and cut out in long, narrow rolls or puffs, make a very pretty and 



BREAD— BISCUITS, ROLLS, MUFFINS, ETC. 239 

elegant dish. Make some good puff paste, roll it out very thin, and cut it into 
pieces of an equal size, about two inches wide and eight inches long; place upon 
each piece a spoonful of jam, wet the edges with the white of &gg. and fold the 
paste over twice; shghtly press the edges together, that the jam may not escape 
in the frying; and when aU are prepared, fry them in boiling lard until of a nice 
brown, letting them remain by the side of the fire after they ar& colored, that 
the paste may be thoroughly done. Drain them before the fli-e, dish on a 
d'oyley, sprinkle over them sifted sugar, and serve. These cannelons are very 
deUcious made with fresh, instead of preserved fruit, such as strawberries, rasp- 
berries, or currants; they should be laid in the paste, plenty of pounded sugar 
sprinkled over, and folded and fried in the same manner as stated above. 

GERMAN FRITTERS. 

Take sHces of stale bread cut in rounds, or stale cake; fry them in hot lard, 
like crullers, to a light brown. Dip each slice when fried in boiling milk, to 
remove the grease; drain quickly, dust with powdered sugar, or spread with 
preserves. Pile on a hot plate, and serve. Sweet wine sauce poured over them 
is very nice. 

HOMINY FRITTERS. 

Take one pint of hot boiled hominy, two eggs, half a teaspoonfiil of salt, and 
a tablespoonful of flour; thin it a little with cold mUk; when cold, add a tea- 
spoonful of baking-powder, mix thoroughly, drop tablespoonf uls of it into ^'^* 
fat and fry to a delicate brown. 

PARSNIP FRITTERS. 

Take three or four good-sized parsnips. Boil them until tender. Mash anu 
season with a little butter, a pinch of salt and a slight sprinkling of pepper. 
Have ready a plate with some sifted flour on it. Drop a tablespoonful of the 
parsnip in the flour and roU it about imtil weU-coated and formed into a ball. 
When you have a sufficient number ready, drop them into boOing drippings or 
lard, as you would a fritter; fry a dehcate brown, and serve hot. Do not put 
them iu a covered dish, for that would steam them and deprive them of their 
crispness, which is one of their great charms. 

These are also very good fried in a frying-pan with a small quantity of lard 
and butter mixed, turning them over so as to fry both sides brown. 

GREEN-CORN FRITTERS. 
One pint of grated, yomig and tender, green com, three eggs, two tablespoon- 
fuls of milk or cream, one tablespoonful of melted butter, if milk is used, a tea/- 



240 BREAD— BISCUITS, ROLLS, MUFFINS, ETC. 

spoonful of salt. Beat the eggs well, add the com by degrees, also the milk and 
butter; thicken with just enough flour to hold them together, adding a tea- 
spoonful of baking-powder to the flour. Have ready a kettle of hot lard, drop 
the com from the spoon into the fat and fry a light brown. They are also nice 
fried iu butter and lard mixed, the same as fried eggs. 

CREAM SHORT-CAKE. 

Sift one quart of flne white flour, rub into it three tablespoonfuls of cold 
butter, a teaspoonf ul of salt, a tablespoonful of white sugar. Add a beaten egg 
to a cup of sour cream, turn it into the other ingredients, dissolve a teaspoonful 
of soda in a spoonful of water, mix all together, handling as httle as possible; 
roll hghtly into two round sheets, place on pie -tins, and bake from twenty to 
twenty-five minutes ia a quick oven. 

This crust is dehcious for fruit short-cakes. 

STRAWBERRY SHORT-CAKE. 

Make a rule of baking-powder biscuit, with the exception of a little more 
shortening; divide the dough in half; lay one-half on the molding-board, (half 
the dough makes one short-cake), divide this half again, and roll each piece large 
enough to cover a biscuit-tin, or a large-sized pie-tin; spread soft butter over the 
lower one, and place the other on top of that; proceed with the other lump of 
dough the same, by cutting it in halves, and putting on another tin. Set them 
in the oven; when sufficiently baked take them out, separate each one by run- 
ning a large knife through where the cold soft butter was spread. Then butter 
plentifully each crust, lay the bottom of each on earthem platters or dining- 
plates; cover thickly with a quart of strawberries that have been previously pre- 
pared with sugar, lay the top crusts on the fruit. If there is any juice left, 
potir it around the cake. This makes a dehcious short-cake. 

Peaches, raspberries, blackberiies, and huckleberries can be substituted for 
strawberries. Always send to the table with a pitcher of sweet cream. 

ORANGE SHORT-CAKE. 

Peel two large oranges, chop them flne, remove the seeds, add half a peeled 
lemon, and one cup of sugar. Spread between the layers of short-cake while 
it is hot. 

LEMON SHORT-CAKE. 

Make a rich biscuit dough, same as above recipe. While baking, take a cup 
and a quarter of water, a cup and a half of sugar, and two lemons, peel, juice 
and pulp, throwing away the tough part of the rind; boil this for some httle 



BREAD— BISCUITS, ROLLS, MUFFINS, ETC. 241 

time; then stir in three crackers rolled fine; split the ehort-cakes while hot, 
spread with butter, then with the mixture. To be eaten warm. 

HUCKLEBERRY SHORT-CAKE. 

Two cupfuls of sugar, half a cupful of butter, one pint of sweet mUk, one 
tablespoonf ul of salt, two heaping teaspoonf uls of baking-powder, sifted into a 
quart of flour, or enough to form a thick batter; add a quart of the huckleberries; 
to be baked in a dripper; cut into squares for the table, and served hot with 
butter. Blackberries may be used the same. 

FRIED DINNER-ROLLS. 

When making Ught raised bread, save out a piece of dough nearly the size 
of a small loaf, roU it out on the board, spread a tablespoonf ul of melted butter 
over it; dissolve a quarter of a teaspoonful of soda in a tablespoonf ul of water, 
and pom- that also over it; work it aU well into the dough, roll it out into a sheet 
not quite half an inch thick. Cut it in strips three inches long and one inch wide. 
Lay them on buttered tins, cover with a cloth, and set away in a cool place 
"until an hour before dinner-time; then set them by the fire where they will 
become light. While they are rising, put into a frying-pan a tablespoonful of 
cold butter and one of lard; when it boils clear and is hot, lay as many of the 
roUs in as wiU fry nicely. As soon as they brown on one side, turn them over 
and brown the other; then turn them on the edges and brown the sides. Add 
fresh grease as is needed. Eat them warm in place of bread. Nice with warm 
meat dinner. 

NEWPORT BREAKFAST-CAKES. 

Take one quart of dough from the bread, at an early hour in the morning; 
break three eggs, separating yolks and whites, both to be whipped to a light 
froth: mi-r them into the dough, and gradually add two tablespoonf uls of melted 
butter, one of sugar, one teaspoonful of soda, and enough warm milk with it 
tmtil it is a batter the consistency of buckwheat cakes; beat it weU, and let it 
rise until breakfast-time. Have the griddle hot and nicely greased, pour on the 
batter in small round cakes, and bake a hght brown, the same as any griddle- 
cake. 

PUFF BALLS. 

A piece of butter as large as an egg, stin-ed until soft; add three well-beaten 
eggs, a pinch of salt, and half a teacupful of- so\n: cream. Stir weU together, 
then add enough flour to make a very thick batter. Drop a spoonful of this 
into boiling water. Cook until the puffs rise to the surface. Dish them hot 



2A2 BREAD— BISCUITS, ROLLS, MUFFINS, ETC. 

with melted butter turned over them. Nice accompaniment to a meat dinner 
as a side-dish — sinular to plain maccaroni. 

BREAKFAST PUFFS. 
Two cups of sour milk, one teaspoonful of soda, one teaspoonf ul of salt, on( 
egg, and flour enough to roll out Uke biscuit dough. Cut into narrow strips, ar 
inch wide, and three inches long; fry brown in hot lard, like doughnuts. Serve 
hot; excellent with coffee. Or, fry in a spider with an ounce each of lard and 
butter, turning and browning aU four of the sides. 

ENGLISH CRUMPETS, 

One quart of warm milk, half a cup of yeast, one teaspoonful of salt, flotu 
enough to make a stiff batter; when Ught, add half a cupful of melted butter, a 
teaspoonful of soda, dissolved in a httle water, and a very httle more flour; lef 
it stand twenty minutes or until hght. Grease some muffin rings, place them 
on a hot griddle, and fill them half full of the batter; when done on one side, 
turn and bake the other side. Butter them while hot; pile one on another, 
and serve immediately. 

PLAIN CRUMPETS. 

Mix together thoroughly, while dry, one quart of sifted flour, loosely measured, 
two heaping teaspoonf uls baking-powder, and a httle salt; then add two table- 
spoonfuls of melted butter, and sweet milk enough to make a thin dough. Bake 
quickly in muffin-rings or patty-pans. 

PREPARED BREAD-CRUMBS. 
Take pieces of stale bread, break them in small bits, put them on a baking- 
pan and place them in a moderate oven, watching closely that they do not 
scorch; then take them while hot and crisp and roU them, crushing them. Sift 
them, using the fine crumbs for breading cutlets, fish, croquettes, etc. The 
coarse ones may be used for puddings, pan-cakes, etc. 

CRACKERS. 

Sift into a pint of flour a heaping teaspoonful of baking-powder, four table- 
spoonfuls of melted butter, half a teaspoonful salt and the white of an egg 
beaten, and one cup of milk; mix it with more flour, enough to make a very 
stiff dough, as stiff as can be rolled out; pounded and kneaded a long time. 
Roll very thin, like pie-crust, and cut out either round or square. Bake a hght 
brown. 



BREAD— BISCUITS, ROLLS, MUFFINS, ETC. 243 

Stale crackers are made crisp and better by placing them ia the oven a few 
moments before they are needed for the table. 

FRENCH CRACKERS. 

Six eggs, twelve tablespoonfuls of sweet milk, six tablespoonfuls of butter, 
half a teaspoonful of soda; mold with flom-, poimding and working half an 
hour; roU it thin. Bake with rather quick fire. 

CORN-MEAL MUSH OR HASTY PUDDING. 

Put two quarts of water into a clean dinner-pot or stew-pan, cover it, and 
let it become boOing hot over the fire; then add a tablespoonful of salt, take off 
the light scum from the top, have sweet, fresh yeUow or white corn-meal; take 
a handful of the meal with the left hand, and a pudding-stick in the right, then 
with the stick, stir the water around, and by degrees let fall the meal; when 
one handful is exhausted, refiU it; continue to stir and add meal until it is as 
thick as you can stir easily, or until the stick wiU stand in it; stir it a while 
longer; let the fire be gentle; when it is sufficiently cooked, which wiU be in half 
an hour, it will bubble or puff up; turn it into a deep basin. This is eaten cold or 
hot, with milk or with butter, and syrup or sugar, or with meat and gravy, 
the same as potatoes or rice. 

FRIED MUSH. 

Make it like the above recipe, turn it into bread-tins, and when cold shoe it, 
dip each piece in flour and fry it in lard and butter mixed in the frying-paUj 
turning to brown well both sides. Must be served hot. 

GRAHAM MUSH. 
Sift Graham meal slowly into boiling salted water, stirring briskly until thick 
as can be stirred with one hand; serve with milk or cream and sugar, or butter 
and syrup. It will be improved by removing from the kettle to a pan, as soon 
as thoroughly mixed, and steaming three or four hours. It may also be eaten 
cold, or sliced and fried, hke corn-meal mush. 

OATMEAL. 
Soak one cup of oatmeal in a quart of water over night, boil half an hour in 
the morning, salted to taste. It is better to cook it in a dish set into a dish of 
boiUng water. 

RICE CROQUETTES. 

Boil for thirty minutes one cup of well- washed rice, in a pint of milk; whip 
into the hot rice the following ingredients: Two ounces of butter, two ounces 



244 BREAD— BISCUITS, ROLLS, MUFFINS, ETC. 

of sugar, some salt, and when slightly cool add the yolks of two eggs well 
beaten; if too stiff pour in a httle more milk; when cold, roU into small baUs 
and dip in beaten eggs, roll in fine cracker or bread-crumbs, and fry same a? 
doughnuts. Or they may be fried in the frying-pan, with a tablespoonful each 
of butter and lard mixed, turning and frying both sides brown. Serve very hot. 

HOMINY 
This form of cereal is very httle known and consequently httle appreciated in 
most Northern households. "Big hominy" and "httle hominy," as they are 
called in the South, are staple dishes there and generally take the place of oat- 
meal, which is apt to be too heating for the chmate. The former is called 
" samp " here. It must be boiled for at least eight hours to be properly cooked, 
and may then be kept on hand for two or three days and warmed over, made 
into croquettes or balls, or fried in cakes. The fine hominy takes two or three 
hours for proper cooking, and should be cooked in a dish set into another of 
hoOing water, and kept steadily boUing until thoroughly soft. 

HOMINY CROQUETTES. 

To a cupful of cold boiled hominy, add a teaspoonful of melted butter, and 
stir it well, adding by degrees a cupful of milk, tiU all is made into a soft, hght 
paste; add a teaspoonful of white sugar, a pinch of salt, and one weU-beaten 
egg. EoU it into oval balls with floured hands, dipped in beaten egg, then rolled 
in cracker-crumbs, and fry in hot lard. 

The hominy is best boUed the day or morning before using. 

BOILED RICE. 

Take half or quarter of a pound of the best quality of rice; wash it in a 
strainer, and put it in a sauce-pan, with a quart of clean water and a pinch of 
salt; let it boU slowly tiU the water is aU evaporated — see that it does not bum 
— then pour in a teacupful of new milk ; stir carefully from the bottom of the 
sauce-pan, so that the upper grain may go under, but do not smash it; close 
the hd on yom* sauce-pan carefully down, and set it on a cooler part of the fire, 
where it will not boU; as soon as it has absorbed the added milk, serve it up 
with fresh new milk, adding fruit and sugar for those who hke them. 

Another nice way to cook rice is to take one teacupful of rice and one 
quart of milk, place in a steamer, and steam from two to three hours; when 
nearly done, stir in a piece of butter as large as the yolk of an egg, and a pinch 
of salt. You can use sugar if you hke. The difference in the time of cooking 
depends on your rice — the older the rice, the longer time it takes to cook.

SAMP, OR HULLED CORN. 

An old-fashioned way of preparing hulled corn was to put a peck of old, 
dry, ripe com into a pot filled with water, and with it a bag of hard-wood ashes, 
say a quart. After soaking awhile it was boiled until the skins or hulls came 
off easUy. The corn was then washed in cold water to get rid of the taste of 
potash, and then boiled imtil the kernels were soft. Another way was to take 
the lye from the leaches where potash was made, dilute it, and boU the corn 
ia this until the skin or hvill came off. It makes a dehcious dish, eaten with mUk 
or cream. 

CKACKED WHEAT. 

Soak the wheat over night in cold water, about a quart of water to a cup of 
wheat; cook it as directed for oatmeal; should be thoroughly done. Eaten with 
sugar and cream. 

OAT FLAKES. 

This healthful oat preparation may be procured from the leading grocers, 
and is prepared as follows: Put into a double sauce-pan or porcelain-Uned pan 
a quart of boihng water, add a saltspoonful of salt, and when it is boihng, add, 
or rather stir in gradually, three ounces of flakes. Keep stirring to prevent 
burning. Let it boil from fifteen to twenty minutes, and serve with cream 
and sugar. 

Ordinary oatmeal requires two hours' steady cooking to make it palatable and 
digestible. Wheaten grits and hominy, one hour, but a half hour longer cooking 
will not injure them, and makes them easier of digestion. Never be afraid of 
cooking cereals or preparations from cereals too long, no matter what the directions 
on the package may be. 

STEAMED OATMEAL. 

To one teacupful oatmeal add a quart of cold water, a teaspoonful of salt; 
put in a steamer over a kettle of cold water, gradually heat and steam an hotu" 
and a half after it begins to cook. 

HOMINY. 

Hominy is a preparation of Indian com, broken or ground, either large or 
small, and is an excellent breakfast dish in winter or summer. Wash the 
hominy thoroughly in one or two waters, then cover it with twice its depth of 
cold water, and let it come to a boil slowly. If it be the large hominy, simmer 
six hours; if the small hominy, simmer two hours. When the water evaporates, 
add hot water; when done, it may be eaten with cream, or allowed to become 
cold and warmed up in the frying-pan, using a Uttle butter to prevent burning. 



246 BREAD—TOAST, 



XEoast 

Toast should be made of stale bread, or at least of bread that has been baked 
a day. Cut smoothly in shoes, not more than half an inch thick; if the crust is 
baked very hard, trim the edges and brown very evenly, but if it happens to 
bum, that should be scraped off. Toast that is to be served with anything 
turned over it, should have the shces first dipped quickly in a dish of hot water 
turned from the boiling tea-kettle, with a httle salt thrown in. Cold biscuits 
cut in halves, and the under crust shced off, then browned evenly on both sides, 
make equally as good toast. The following preparations of toast are almost all 
of them very nice dishes, served with a family breakfast. 

MILK TOAST. 

Put over the fire a quart of milk, put into it a tablespoonful of cold butter, 
stir a heaping teaspoonful of flour into half a gUl of milk; as soon as the mUk 
on the fire boils, stir in the flour, add a teaspoonful of salt; let all boil up once, 
remove from the fire, and dip in this shces of toasted bread. When aU are 
used up, pour what is left of the scalded mUk over the toast. Cover, and send 
to the table hot. 

CREAM TOAST. 

Heat a pint of milk to boihng, and add a piece of butter the size of an egg; 
stir a tablespoonful of flour smoothly into a cup of rich cream, and add some of 
the boihng milk to this; heat it gradually and prevent the flour from lumping; 
then stir into the boihng milk, and let it cook a few moments: salt to taste. 
After taking from the fire stir in a beaten egg; strain the mixture i»n to toast 
hghtly buttered. 

AMERICAN TOAST. 

To one egg thoroughly beaten, put one cup of sweet milk, and a Httle salt. 
Slice light bread and dip into the mixture, allowing each shoe to absorb some of 
the milk; then brown on a hot, buttered griddle or thick-bottom frying-pan; 
spread with butter, and serve hot. 

NUNS' TOAST. 

Cut four or five hard-boiled eggs into shces. Put a piece of butter half the 

size of an egg into a sauce-pan, and when it begins to bubble add a finely 

chopped onion. Let the onion cook a httle without taking color, then stir in a 

teaspoonful of flour. Add a cupful of milk, and stir imtil it becomes smooth; 



BREAD— TOAST. 247 

then put in the slices of eggs and let them get hot. Pour over neatly trimmed 
slices of hot buttered toast. The sauce must be seasoned to taste with pepper 
and salt. 

CHEESE TOAST. No. I. 
Toast thin shces of bread an even, crisp brown. Place on a warm plate, 
allowing one small shoe to each person, and pour on enough melted cheese to 
cover them. Eich new cheese is best. Serve while warm. Many prefer a Httle 
prepared mustard spread over the toast before putting on the cheese. 

CHEESE TOAST. No. 2. 

Put half an ounce of butter in a frying-pan; when hot, add gradually four 
ounces of mild American cheese. Whisk it thoroughly until melted. Beat 
together half a pint of cream and two eggs; whisk into the cheese, add a little 
salt, pour over the crisp toast, and serve. 

The two above recipes are usually called " Welsh Earebit." 

OYSTER TOAST. 

Select the large ones, used for frying, and first dip them in beaten egg, then 
in either cracker or bread-crumbs, and cook upon a fine wire gridiron, over a 
quick fire. Toast should be made ready in advance, and a rich cream sauce 
■ooured over the whole. After pouring on the sauce, finely cut celery strewn 
over the top adds to their dehcacy. 

Or, wash oysters in the shell, and put them on hot coals, or upon the top of 
a hot stove, or bake them in a hot oven; open the shells with an oyster-knife, 
taking care to lose none of the liquor. Dip the toast into hot, salted water 
quickly, and turn out the oyster and Uquor over the toast; season with salt and 
pepper, and a teaspoonful of melted butter over each. 

Oysters steamed in the shell are equally as good. 

MUSHROOMS ON TOAST. 

Peel a quai-t of mushrooms, and cut off a Uttle of the root end. Melt an 
oimce of butter in the frying pan, and fry in it half a pound of raw minced steak; 
add two saltspoonfuls of salt, a pinch of cayenne, and a giU of hot water; fry 
until the juices are extracted from the meat; tilt the pan and squeeze the meat 
with the back of the spoon until there is nothing left but dry meat, then remove 
it; add the mushrooms to the Uquid, and if there is not enough of it, add more 
butter; toss them about a moment and pom* out on hot toast. 

Some add a little sherry to the dish before removing from the fire. 



■?48 BREAD— TOAST. 

TOMATO TOAST. 
Pare and stew a quart of ripe tomatoes until smooth. Season with salt, 
pepper and a tablespoonf ul of butter. When done, add one cup sweet cream 
and a httle flour. Let it scald but not boU; remove at once. Pour over slices 
of dipped toast, weU-buttered. 

EGGS ON TOAST. 

Various preparations of eggs can be served on toast, first dipping slices of 
weU-toasted bread qviickly in hot salted water, then turning over them scrambled, 
poached or creamed eggs, aU foimd in the recipes among " Eggs." 

BAKED EGGS ON TOAST. 

Toast six slices of stale bread, dip them in hot salted water and butter them 
lightly. After arranging them on a platter or deep plate, break enough eggs to 
cover them, breaking one at a time, and slip over the toast so that they do not 
break; sprinkle over them salt and pepper, and turn over aU some kind of thick- 
ened gravy — either chicken or lamb, cream or a cream sauce made the same as 
" White Sauce "; turn this over the toast and eggs, and bake in a hot oven until 
the eggs are set, or about five minutes. Serve at once. 

HAM TOAST. 
Take a quarter of a pound of either boiled or fried ham, chop it fine, mix it 
with the yolks of two eggs, weU-beaten, a tablespoonful of butter, and enough 
cream or rich mUk to make it soft, a dash of pepper. Stir it over the fire until 
it thickens. Dip the toast for an instant in hot, salted water; spread over some 
melted butter, then turn over the ham mixture. Serve hot. 

REED BIRDS ON TOAST. 

Remove the feathers and legs of a dozen reed birds, spht them down the back, 
remove the entrails, and place them on a double broiler; brush a little melted 
butter over them, and broil the inner side thoroughly first; then Ughtly broil 
the other side. Melt one-quarter of a pound of butter, season it nicely with salt 
■end pepper, dip the birds in it, and arrange them nicely on shces of toast. 

MINCED FOWLS ON TOAST. 

Eemove from the bones aU the meat of either cold roast or boiled fowls. 

Clean it from the skin, and keep covered from the air, until ready for use. Boil 

the bones and skin with three-fourths of a pint of water until reduced quite 

half. Strain the gravy and let it cool. Next, having skimmed off the fat, put 



BREAD— TOAST. 24g 

it into a clean sauce-pan with half a cup of cream, three tablespoonf uls of butter, 
well-mixed with a tablespoonful of flour. Keep these stirred until they boil. 
Then put in the fowl finely minced, with three hard-boiled eggs, chopped, and 
sufficient salt and pepper to season. Shake the mince over the fire until just 
ready to serve. Dish it over hot toast and serve. 

HASHED BEEF ON TOAST. 

Chop a quantity of cold roast beef rather fine, and season it well with peppei 
and salt. For each pint of meat add a level tablespooful of flour. Stir weU, and 
add a smaJl teacupful of soup-stock or water. Put the mixture into a small 
stew-pan, and, after covering it, simmer for twenty minutes. Meanwhile, 
toast half a dozen shoes of bread nicely, and at the end of the twenty minutes 
spread the meat upon them. Serve at once on a hot dish. In case water be 
used instead of soup-stock, add a tablespoonful of butter just before spreading the 
beef upon the toast. Any kind of cold meat may be prepared in a similar manner. 

— Maria Parloa. 
VEAL HASH ON TOAST. 

Take a teacupful of boiling water in a sauce-pan, stir in an even teaspoonful 
of flour, wet in a tablespoonful of cold water, and let it boil five minutes; add 
one-half teaspoonful of black pepper, as much salt, and two tablespoonfuls of 
butter, and let it keep hot, but not boil. Chop the veal fine, and mix with it 
half as much stale bread-crumbs. Put it in a pan, and pom* the gravy over it, 
then let it simmer ten minutes. Serve this on buttered toast. 

CODFISH ON TOAST. (Cuban Style.) 
Take a teacupful of freshened codfish, picked up fine. Fry a sHced onion 
in a tablespoonful of butter; when it has turned a Hght brown, put in the fish 
with water enough to cover it; add half a can of tomatoes, or half a dozen of 
fresh ones. Cook all nearly an hour, seasoning with a httle pepper. Serve 
on shces of dipped toast, hot. Very fine. 

Plain creamed codfish is very nice turned over dipped toast. 

HALIBUT ON TOAST. 

Put into boiling, salted water, one poimd of fresh halibut; cook slowly for 
fifteen minutes, or until done; remove from the water and chop it fine; then add 
half a cup of melted butter, and eight eggs well beaten. Season with salt and 
pepper. 

Place over the fire a thick-bottomed frying-pan containing a tablespoonful of 
cold butter; when it begins to melt, tip the pan so as to grease the sides; then 



2.SO BREAD— TOAST. 

put in the fish and eggs and stir one way untU the eggs are cooked, but not too 
bard. Turn over toast, dipped in hot, salted water. 

CHICKEN HASH WITH RICE TOAST. 
Boil a cup of rice the night before; put it into a square, narrow bread-pan, 
set it in the ice-box. Next morning, cut it into half -inch sUces, rub over each 
sUce a little warm butter, and toast them on a broiler to a dehcate brown. Ar- 
range the toast on a warm platter and tvim over the whole a chicken hash, made 
from the remains of cold fowl, the meat picked from the bones, chopped fine, 
put into the frying-pan, with butter, and a Uttle water to moisten it, adding pep- 
per and salt. Heat hot all through. Serve immediately. 

APPLE TOAST. 
Cut six apples into quarters, take the core out, peel and cut them ia 
slices; put in the sauce-pan an ounce of butter, then throw over the apples 
about two ounces of white powdered sugar and two tablespoonfuls of water; 
put the sauce-pan on the fire, let it stew quickly, toss them up, or stir with a 
spoon; a few minutes wiU do them. When tender, cut two or three slices of 
bread half an inch thick; put in a frying-pan two ounces of butter, put on the 
fire; when the butter is melted, put in your bread, which fry of a nice yellowish 
color; when nice and crisp, take them out, place them on a dish, a little white 
sugar over, the apples about an inch thick. Serve hot. 




SUGGESTIONS IN REGARD TO CAKE MAKING. 

Use none but the best materials, and aH the ingredients should be properly 
prepared before commencing to mix any of them. Eggs beat up much lighter 
and sooner by being placed in a cold place some time before using them; a small 
pinch of soda sometimes has the same effect. Mour should always be sifted 
before using it. Cream of tartar or baking-powder should be thoroughly mixed 
with the flour; butfter be placed where it will become moderately soft, but not 
melted in the least, or the cake will be sodden and heavy. Sugar should be 
roUed and sifted; spices ground or povmded; raisins or any other fruit looked 
over and prepared; currants, especially, should be nicely washed, picked, dried 
in a cloth, and then carefully examined, that no pieces of grit or stone may be 
left amongst them. They should then be laid on a dish before the fire to become 
thoroughly dry; as," if added damp to the other ingredients, cakes will be liable 
to be heavy. 

Eggs should be well-beaten, the whites and yolks separately, the yolks to a 
thick cream, the whites until they are a stiff froth. Always stir the butter and 
sugar to a cream, then add the beaten yolks, then the milk, the flavoring, then 
the beaten whites, and lastly the floxu". If fruit is to be used, measure and 
dredge with a little sifted flour, stir in gradually and thoroughly. 

Pour all in weU-buttered cake-pans. While the cake is baking, care should 
be taken that no cold air enters the oven, only when necessary to see that the 
cake is baking properly; the oven should be an even, moderate heat, not too 
cold or too hot; much depends on this for success. 

Cake is often spoiled for being looked at too often when first put into the 
oven. The heat should be tested before the cake is put in, which can be done 
by throwing on the floor of the oven a tablespoonful of new flour. If the flour 
takes fire, or assumes a dark-brown color, the temperature is too high, and the 

17 



252 CAKES. 

oven must be allowed to cool; if the flour remains white after the lapse of a few 
seconds, the temperature is too low. When the oven is of the proper tempera- 
ture, the flour will shghtly brown and look slightly scorched. 

Another good way to test the heat, is to drop a, few spoonfuls of the cake, 
batter on a small piece of buttered letter-paper, and place it in the oven during 
the finishing of the cake, so that the piece will be baked before putting in the 
whole cake ; if the little drop of cake-batter bakes evenly without burning 
around the edge, it will be safe to put the whole cake in the oven. Then again 
if the oven seems too hot, fold a thick brown paper double, and lay on the 
bottom of the oven; then after the cake has risen, put a thick brown paper over 
the top, or butter weU a thick white paper and lay carefully over the top. 

If, after the cake is put in, it seems to bake too fast, put a brown paper 
loosely over the top of the pan, care being taken that it does not touch the cake, 
and do not open the door for five minutes at least; the cake should then be 
quickly examined, and the door shut carefully, or the rush of cold air wUl cause 
it to fall. Setting a small dish of hot water in the oven, will also prevent the 
cake from scorching. 

To ascertain when the cake is done, run a broom straw into the middle of it; 
\f it comes out clean and smooth, the cake wiU do to take out. 

Where the recipe calls for baking powder, and you have none, you can use 
sream tartar and soda in proportion to one level teaspoonful of soda, two 
heaping teaspoonfuls of cream tartar. 

When sour milk is called for in the recipe, use only soda. Cakes made with 
molasses bum much more easily than those made with sugar. 

Never stir cake after the butter and sugar is creamed, but beat it down from 
the bottom, up, and over; this laps air into the cake- batter, and produces little 
air cells,, which causes the dough to puff and sweU when it comes in contact 
with the heat while cooking. 

When making most cakes, especially sponge cake, the fiour should be 
added by degrees, stirred very slowly and lightly, for if stirred hard and fast it 
win make it porous and tough. 

Cakes should be kept iu tight tiu cake-cans, or earthem jars, in a cool, dry 
place. 

Cookies, jumbles, ginger-snaps, etc., require a quick oven; if they become 
moist or soft by keeping, put again into the oven a few minutes. 

To remove a cake from a tin after it is baked, so that it will not crack, break 
or fall, first butter the tin well aU around the sides and bottom; then cut a 
piece of letter-paper to exactly fit the tin, butter that on both sides, placing 



CAKES. 253 

it smoothly on the bottom and sides of the tin. When the cake is baked, let it 
remain in the tin until it is cold\ then set it in the oven a minute, or just long 
enough to warm the tin through. Eemove it from the oven; turn it upside 
down on your hand, tap the edge of the tin on the table and it will sUp out with 
ease, leaving it whole. 

If a cake-pan is too shallow for holding the quantity of cake to be baked, for 
fear of its being so hght as to rise above the pan, that can be remedied by 
thoroughly greasing a piece of thick glazed letter-paper with soft butter. Place 
or fit it around the sides of the buttered tin, allowing it to reach an inch or 
more above the top. If the oven heat is moderate, the butter wiU preserve the 
paper from burning. 

FROSTING OR ICING. 

In the first place, the eggs should be cold, _ and the platter on which they are 
to be beaten also cold. AUow, for the white of one egg, one smaU teacupful 
of powdered sugar. Break the eggs and throw a smaU handful of the sugar on 
them as soon as you begin beating; keep adding it at intervals untU it is aU used 
up. The eggs must no^be beaten untU the sugar has been added in this way, 
which gives a smooth, tender frosting, and one that will dry much sooner than 
the old way. 

Spread with a broad knife evenly over the cake, and if it seems too thin, beat 
in a little more sugar. Cover the cake with two coats, the second after the first 
has become dry, or nearly so. If the icing gets too dry or stiff before the last 
coat is needed, it can be thinned sufficiently with a httle water, enough to make 
it work smoothly. 

A little lemon-juice, or half a teaspoonful of tartaric acid, added to the frost- 
ing while being beaten, makes it white and more frothy. 

The flavors mostly used are lemon, vanilla, almond, rose, chocolate, and 
orange. If you wish to ornament with figures or flowers, make up rather more 
icing, keep about one-third out untfl that on the cake is dried; then, with a clean, 
glass syringe, apply it in such forms as you desire and dry as before; what you 
keep out to ornament with may be tinted pink with cochineal, blue with indigo, 
yellow with saffron or the grated rind of an orange strained through a cloth, 
green with spinach juice, and brown with chocolate, purple with cochineal and 
indigo. Strawberry, or currant and cranberry juices color a deUcate pink. 

Set the cake in a cool oven with the door open, to dry, or in a draught in an 
open window. 



254 CAKES. 

ALMOND FROSTING. 

• The whites of three eggs, beaten up with three cups of fine, white sugar. 
Blanch a pound of sweet almonds, pound them in a mortar with a little sugar, 
until a fine paste, then add the whites of eggs, sugar and vaniUa extract. Pound 
a few minutes to thoroughly mix. Cover the cake with a very thick coating of 
this, set in a cool oven to dry, afterwards cover with a plain icing. 

CHOCOLATE FROSTING. 

The whites of four eggs, three cups of powdered sugar, and nearly a cup of 
grated chocolate. Beat the whites a very httle, they must not become white; 
stir iu the chocolate, then put in the sugar gradually, beating to mix it weU. 

PLAIN CHOCOLATE ICING. 

Put into a shallow pan four tablespoonf uls of scraped chocolate, and place it 
wJEiere it wiU melt gradually, but rfot scorch; when melted, stir in three table- 
spoonfuls of milk or cream, and one of water; mix all well together, and add 
one scant teacupful of sugar; boil about five minutes, and while hot, and when 
the cakes are nearly cold, spread some evenly over the surface of one of the 
cakes; put a second one on top, alternating the mixture and cakes; then cover 
top and sides, and set in a warm oven to harden. AU who have tried recipe 
after recipe, vainly hoping to find one where the chocolate sticks to the cake 
and not to the fingers, wiU appreciate the above. In making those most palat- 
able of cakes, "Chocolate Eclairs," the recipe just given wiU be found very 
satisfactory. 

TUTTI FRUTTI ICING. 
Mix with boiled icing one ounce each of chopped citron, candied cherries, 
seedless raisins, candied pineapple, and blanched almonds. 

SUGAR ICING. 
To one pound of extra refined sugar, add one ounce of fine white starch; 
Dound finely together, and then sift them through gauze; then beat the whites 
of three eggs to a froth. The secret of success is to beat' the eggs long enough, 
and always one way; add the powdered sugar by degrees, or it wiU spoil the 
froth of the eggs. When all the sugar is stirred in, continue the whipping for 
half an hour longer, adding more sugar if the ice is too thin. Take a little 
of the icing and lay it aside for ornamenting afterward. When the cake comes 
.out, of the oven, spread the sugar icing smoothly over it with a knife, and dry 



CAKES. 255 

it at once in a cool oven. For ornamenting the cake, the icing may be tinged 
any color preferred. For pink, use a few drops of cochineal; for yellow a pinch 
of saffron, dissolved; for green, the juice of some chopped spinach. Whichever 
is chosen, let the coloring be first mixed with a httle colorless spirit, and then 
stirred into the white iciug until the tint is deep enough. To ornament the cake 
with it, make a cone of stiff writing paper, and squeeze the colored icing through 
it, so as to form leaves, beading or letters, as the case may be. It requires nicety 
and care to do it with success. 

BOILED FROSTING. 

To one pound of finest pulverised sugar, add three wine-glassfuls of clear 
water. Let it stand until it dissolves; then boil it until it is perfectly clear and 
threads from the spoon. Beat well the whites of four eggs. Pour the sugar into 
the dish with the eggs, but do not mix them until the syrup is luke-warm; then 
beat aU well together for one half hour. 

Season to your taste with vaniUa, rose-water, or lemon-juice. The first coat- 
ing may be put on the cake as soon as it is well mixed. Rub the cake with a 
little flour before you apply the icing. While the first coat is drying, continue 
to beat the remainder; you wiU not have to wait long if the cake is set in a warm 
place near the fire. This is said to be a most excellent recipe for icing. 

FROSTING WITHOUT EGGS. 

An excellent frosting may be made without eggs or gelatine, which will keep 
longer, and cut more easily, causing no breakage or crumbling, and withal is 
very economical. * 

Take one cup of granulated sugar; dampen it with one-fourth of a cup of 
mUk, or five tablespoonfuls; place it on the fire in a suitable dish, and stir it 
until it boils; then let it boil for five minutes without stirring; remove it from 
the fire and set the dish in another of cold water; add flavoring. While it is 
coohng, stir or beat it constantly, and it will become a thick, creamy frosting. 

GELATINE FROSTING. 

Soak one teaspoonful of gelatine in one tablespoonful of cold water half an 
hotu*, dissolve in two .tablespoonfuls of hot water; add one cup of powdered sugai 
and stir until smooth. < 

GOLDEN FROSTING. 
A very delicious and handsome frosting can be made by using the yolks o£ 
eggs instead of the whites. Proceed exactly as for ordinary frosting. It will 
harden just as nicely as that does. This is i)artici4arly good for orange cakej

BREAD OR RAISED CAKE. 

Two cupfiils of raised dough; beat into it two-thirds of a cup of butter and two 
cups of sugar creamed together, three egg3, well beaten, one even teaspoonful of 
soda, dissolved ia two tablespoonfuls of nult, half a nutmeg grated, one table- 
spoonful of cumamon, a teaspoonful of cloves, one cup of raisins. Mix aU well 
together, put iu the beaten whites of eggs and raisins last; beat aH hard for 
several minutes; put in buttered pans, and let it stand half an hour to rise again 
before baking. Bake in a moderate oven. Half a glass of brandy is an im- 
provement, if you have it convenient. 

FRUIT CAKE. (Superior.)

glass of wine, one wine-glass of brandy, one coffee-cupful molasses with the 
spices in it; steep this gently twenty or thirty minutes, not boiling hot; beat the 
eggs very hghtly; put the fruit in last, stirring it gradually, also a teaspoonful 
of soda dissolved in a tablespoonful of water; the fruit should be weU flovired; if 
necessary add flour after the fruit is in; butter a sheet of paper and lay it in the 
pan. Lay in some slices of citron, then a layer of the mixture, then of citron 
again, etc., tiU the pan is nearly fuU. Sake three or four hours, according to 
the thickness of the loaves, in a tolerably hot oven, and with steady heat. Let 
it cool in the oven gradually. Ice when cold. It improves this cake very much 
fco add three teaspoonfuls of baking-powder to the flour. A fine wedding-cake 
recipe. 

FRUIT CAKE BY MEASURE. (Excellent.) 

Two scant teacupfuls of butter, three cupfuls of dark-brown sugar, six eggs, 
whites and yolks beaten separately, one pound of raisins, seeded, one of cur- 
rants, washed and dried, and half a pound of citron cut in thin strips; also half 
a cupful of cooking molasses, and half a cupful of sour milk. Stir the butter and 
sugar to a cream, add to that half a grated nutmeg, one tablespoonful of ground 
cinnamon, one teaspoonful of cloves, one teaspoonful of mace, add the molasses 
and sour milk. Stir all well; then put in the beaten yolks of egg, a wine-glass 
of brandy; stir again all thoroughly, and then add four cupfuls of sifted flour,

half cups of flour, the whites of seven eggs, two even teaspoonfuls of baking- 
powder, one pound each of seeded raisins, flgs, and blanched almonds, and one- 
quarter of a pound of citron, all chopped fine. Mix all thoroughly before adding 
the fruit; add a teaspoonful of lemon extract. Put baking-powder in the flour, 
and mix it weU before adding it to the other ingredients. Sift a httle flour over 
the fruit before stirring it in. Bake slowly two hours and try with a splint to 
see when it is done. A cup of grated cocoanut is a nice addition to this cake. 

MOLASSES FRUIT CAKE. 

One teacupful of butter, one teacupful of brown sugar, worked well together; 
next two teacupfuls of cooking molasses, one cupful of milk with a teaspoonfiil 
of soda dissolved in it; one tablespoonful of ginger, one tablespoonfiil of cinnamon, 
and one teaspoonful of cloves; a httle grated nutmeg. Now add fovir eggs weU- 
beaten, and five cups of sifted floiu", or enough to make a stiff batter. Flour a 
cup of raisins, and one of currants; add last. Bake in a very moderate oven, 
one hour. If weU covered will keep six months. 

SPONGE CAKE.

ALMOND SPONGE CAKE. 

The addition of almonds makes this cake very superior to the usual sponge- 
cake. Sift one pint of fine flour; blanch in scalding water two omices of sweet 
and two ounces of bitter almonds, renewing the hot water when expedient; when 
the skins are aU off wash the almonds in cold water (mixing the sweet and 
bitter), and wipe them dry; pound them to a fine, smooth paste (one at a time), 
adding, as you proceed, water or white of egg to prevent their boihng. Set them 
in a cool place; beat ten eggs, the whites and yolks separately, till very smooth 
and thick, and then beat into them gradually two cups powdered sugar in turn 
with the pounded almonds; lastly add the flour, stirring it round slowly and 
lightly on the surface of the mixture, as in common sponge-cake; have ready 
buttered a deep square pan; put the mixture carefully into it, set into the oven, 
and bake tfll thoroughly done and risen very high; when cool, cover it with plain 
white icing flavored with rose-water or with almond icing. With sweet 
ahnonds always use a small portion of bitter; without them, sweet almonds have 
little or no taste, though they add to the richness of the cake. 

Use two heaping teaspoonfuls of baking-powder in the flom". 

OLD-FASHIONED SPONGE CAKE. 

Two cups of sifted white sugar, two cups of flour measured before sifting, 
ten eggs. Stir the yolks and sugar together until perfectly light; add a pinch of 
salt; beat the whites of the eggs to a very stiff froth, and add them with the 
flour, after beating together lightly; flavor with lemon. Bake in a moderate 
oven about forty-five minutes. Baking-powder is an improvement to this cake, 
using two large teaspoonfuls. 

LEMON SPONGE CAKE. 

Into one level cup of flour put a level teaspoonful of baking-powder and sift 
it. Grate off the yeUow rind of a lemon. Separate the whites from the yolks 
of four eggs. Measure a scant cup of white granulated sugar and beat it to a 
cream with the yolks, then add the grated rind and a tablespoonful of the juice 
of the lemon. Stir together until thick and creamy; now beat the whites to a 
stiff froth; then quickly and hghtly mix without heating a third of the flour 
with the yolks; then a third of the whites; then more flour and whites until all 
are used. The mode of mixing must be very light, rather cutting down through 
the cake-batter than beating it; beating the eggs makes them Hght, but beating 
the batter makes the cake tough. Bake immediately until a straw run into it 
can be withdrawn clean. 

This recipe is especially nice for Charlotte Eusse, being so light and poroua

PLAIN SPONGE CAKE. 

Beat the yolks of four eggs together with two cups of fine powdered sugar, 
Stir in gradually one cup of sifted flour, and the whites of four eggs beaten to a 
stiff froth, then a cup of sifted flour in which two teaspoonf uls of baking-powdel 
have been stirred, and lastly, a scant teacupful of boiling water, stirred in a Uttk 
at a time. Flavor, add salt, and, however thin the mixture may seem, do not 
add any more flour. Bake in shallow tins. 

BRIDE'S CAKE. 

Cream together one scant cup of butter and three cups of sugar, add one cup 
of milk, then the beaten whites of twelve eggs; sift three teaspoonf uls of baking-

One pound of butter, one and one-quarter pounds of flour, one pound of 
pounded loaf sugar, one pound of currants, nine eggs, two ounces of candied 
peel, one-half ounce of citron, one-half ounce of sweet almonds; when hked, a 
Uttle poimded mace. Work the butter to a cream; add the sugar, then the well- 
beaten yolks of eggs, next the flour, currants, candied peel, which should be cut 
into neat slices, and the almonds, which should be blanched and chopped, and 
mix aU these weU together; whisk the whites of eggs, and let them be thoroughly 
blended with the other ingredients. Beat the cake well for twenty minutes, 
and put it into a round tin, hned at the bottom and sides with strips of white 
buttered paper. Bake it from two hours to two and a half, and let the oven be 
weU-heated when the cake is first put in, as, if this is not the case, the currants 
win all sink to the bottom of it. A glass of wine is usually added to the mix- 
ture; but this is scarcely necessary, as the cake will be found quite rich enough 
without it. 

PLAIN POUND CAKE. 

This is the old-fashioned recipe that our mothers used to make, and it can be 
kept for weeks in an earthen jar, closely covered, first dipping letter-paper in 
brandy and placing over the top of the cake before covering the jar

flavoring, part of the flour, the beaten whites of eggs, then the rest of the flour. 
Bake carefully in tins lined with buttered white paper. 

When using the whites of eggs for nice cake, the yolks need not be wasted ; keep

improved by dissolving a half -teaspoonful of soda in a tablespoonf ul of milk 
in the morning. It should stand in the greased pans and rise some time until 
quite light before baking. 

CREAM CAKE. 

Four eggs, whites and yolks beaten separately, two teacups of sugar, one cup 
of sweet cream, two heaping cupfuls of flour, one teaspoonful of soda; mix two 
teaspoonfuls of cream of tartar in the flour before sifting. Add the whites the 
last thing before the flour, and stir that in gently without beating.

raisins, seeded and chopped, then mixed with a cup of sifted flour, one teaspoon- 
ful of nutmeg, one teaspoonful of powdered cinnamon, and lastly, one pint of

this, add the flour, stirring quickly and hghtly. Pour it into a clean, bright tin 
cake-dish, which should not be buttered or hned. Bake at once in a moderate 
oven about forty minutes, testing it with a broom splint. When done, let ii 
remain in the cake-tin, turning it upside down, with the sides resting on the top 
of two saucers, so that a current of air wiU pass under and over it. 

This is the best recipe found after trying several. A perfection cake.

sour mUk, one teaspoonful of soda, (just even full), and five cupfuls of flour, one

One and one-half cups sugar, two eggs, one-half cup butter, three-fourths 
cup milk, two heaping cups fiour with one teaspoonful cream tartar, one-half 
teaspoonful of soda, dissolved in the mUk. Put half the above mixture in a

and a httle nutmeg, and one tablespoonful flour. Bake this in same kind of 
tins. Put the sheets of cake together while warm, with jelly between.

cup of butter, one cup and a half of flour, half a cup of wine^ one cup of raisins, 
18 



268 CAKES. 

two eggs and half a teaspoonful of soda; put these ingredients together with 
care, just as if it were a very rich cake; bake it in three layers, and put frosting 
between — the frosting to be made of the whites of two eggs with enough pow- 
dered sugar to make it thick. The top of the cake may be frosted if you choose. 

WHIPPED CREAM CAKE. 

One cup of sugar and two tablespoonfuls of soft butter stirred together; add 
the yolks of two eggs weU-beaten, then add four tablespoonfuls of mUk, some 
flavoring, then the beaten whites oE the eggs. Mix a teaspoonful of cream 
tartar and half a teaspoon of soda in a cup of flour, sift it into the cake batter,

powder. The flour added gradually. Bake in long, shallow biscuit-tins, well- 
greased. Tvirn out on a damp towel on a bread-board, and cover the top with 
jeUy, and roll up while warm. 

TO CUT LAYER CAKE. 

When cutting Layer-Cakes, it is better to first make a round hole in the 
cake, with a knife or tin tube, about an inch and a quarter in diameter. This 
prevents the edge of the cake from crumbling when cutting it. 

When making custard filling for Layer-Cake, always set the dish contain- 
ing the custard in another dish of boiling water over the fire; this prevents its 
burning, which would destroy its flavor. 

LAYER JELLY CAKE. 

Almost any soft cake recipe can be used for jeUy-cake. The following is 
excellent: One cup of sugar, half a cup of butter, three eggs, half a cup of sweet 
milk, two cups of flour, two heaping teaspoonfuls of baking-powder, flavoring. 

For white, delicate cake, the rule for " Sflver Cake " is fine; care should be 
taken, however, that the oven is just right for this cake, as it browns very 
easily. To be baked in jelly-cake tins, in layers, with filling put between when 
done. 



CAKES— FILLINGS FOR LAYER CAKES. 269 

Any of the following cake-filling recipes may be used with these cake recipes. 

JUUnoe for Xaiget Cakes* 

No. I. CREAM FILLING. 

Cream filling is made with one pint of new nulk, two eggs, three tablespoon- 
fnls of sifted flour (or half cup of corn starch), one cup of sugar. Put two-thirds 
of the milk on the stove to boU, stir the sugar, flour and eggs in what is left. 
When the milk boils, put into it the whole, and cook it imtil it is as thick as 
custard; when cool, add vanflla extract. This custard is nice with a cup of 
hickory nuts, kernels chopped fine, and stirred into it. Spread between the 
layers of cake. This custard can be made of the yolks of the eggs only, aaving 
the whites for the cake part. 

No. 2. ANOTHER CREAM FILLING. 

One cup powdered sugar, one-fourth cup hot water. Let them simmer. 
Beat white of an egg and mix with the above; when cold, add one-half cup 
chopped raisins, one-half cup chopped walnuts, one tablespoonful of grated 
cocoanut. 

No. 3. ICE-CREAM FILLING. 

Make an icing as follows: Three cups of sugar, one of water; boil to a thick, 
clear syrup, or until it begins to be brittle; pom* this, boiling hot, over the weM- 
beaten whites of three eggs; stir the mixture very briskly, and pour the sugar 
in slowly; beat it when all in, until cool. Flavor with lemon or vanflla extract. 
This, spread between any white cake layers, answers for " Ice-Oream Cake." 

No. 4. APPLE FILLING. 

Peel, and slice green, tart apples; put them on the fire with sugar to suit; 
when tender, remove, rub them through a fine sieve, and add a small piece of 
butter. When cold, use to spread between the layers; cover the cake with 
plenty of sugar. 

No. 5. ANOTHER APPLE FILLING. 

One coffee-cup of sugar, one egg, three large apples grated, one lemon grated, 
juice and outside of the rind; beat together and cook till quite thick. To be 
cooled before putting on the cake. Spread between layers of cake.

No. 6. CREAM FROSTING. 

A cup of sweet thick cream whipped, sweetened and flavored with vamllai, 
cut a loaf of cake in two, spread the frosting between and on the top; this tastes 
like Charlotte Eusse. 

No. 7. PEACH-CREAM FILLING. 

Out peaches into thin slices, or chop them and prepare cream by whipping 
and sweetening. Put a layer of peaches between the layers of cake and pour 
cream over each layer and over the top. Bananas, strawberries or other fruits 
may be used in the same way, mashing strawberries, and stewing thick with 
powdered sugar. 

No. 8. CHOCOLATE CREAM FOR FILLING. 

Five tablespoonfuls of grated chocolate, enough cream or milk to wet it, one 
cupful of sugar, one egg, one teaspoonful vanilla flavoring. Stir the ingredients 
over the fire until thoroughly mixed, having beaten the egg well, before adding 
it; then add the vanilla flavoring after it is removed from the fire. 

No. 9. ANOTHER CHOCOLATE FILLING. 

The whites of three eggs beaten stiff, one cup of sugar, and ono cup of grated 
chocolate, put between the layers and on top. 

No. 10. BANANA FILLING. 

Make an icing of the whites of two eggs, and one cup and a half of powdered 
sugar. Spread this on the layers, and then cover thickly and entirely with 
bananas shced thin or chopped fine. This cake may be flavored with vanilla. 
The top should be simply frosted. 

No. II. LEMON-JELLY FILLING. 

Grate the yellow from the rind of two lemons and squeeze out the juice; two 
flupfuls of sugar, the yolks and whites of two eggs beaten separately. Mix the 
sugar and yolks, then add the whites, and then the lemons. Now, pour on a 
cupful of boihng water; stir into this two tablespoonfuls of sifted flour, rubbed 
smooth in half a cup of water; then add a tablespoonful of melted butter; cook 
until it thickens. When cold, spread between the layers of cake. Oranges can 
be used in place of lemons. 

Another filhng of lemon (without cooking) is made of the grated rind and 
juice of two lemons, and the whites of two eggs beaten with one cup of sugar. 



CAKES. 271 

No. 12. ORANGE-CAKE FILLING. 

Peel two large oranges, remove the seeds, chop them fine, add half a peeled 
lemon, one cup of sugar, and the well-beaten white of an egg. Spread be- 
tween the layers of " Silver Cake " recipe. 

No. 13. FIG FILLING. 
Take a poimd of figs, chop fine, and put into a stew-pan on the stove; pour 
over them a teacupful of water, and add a half cup of sugar. Cook aU together 
until soft and smooth. When cold, spread between layers of cake. 

No. 14. FRUIT FILLING. 
Four tablespoonfuls of very fine chopped citron, foiu- tablespoonfuls of finely 
chopped seeded raisins; half of a cupful of blanched almonds chopped fine; also 
a quarter of a pound of finely chopped figs. Beat the whites of three eggs to a 
stiff froth, adding half of a cupful of sugar; then mix thoroughly into this the 
whole of the chopped ingredients. Put it between the layers of cake when the 
cake is hot, so that it wiU cook the egg a httle. This wiU be found dehcious. 



CUSTARD OR CREAM CAKE. 

Cream together two cups of sugar and half a cup of butter; add half a cup of 
sweet milk in which is dissolved half a teaspoonful of soda. Beat the whites of 
six eggs to a stiff froth, and add to the mixtiu-e. Have one heaping teaspoonful 
of cream tartar stirred thoroughly into three cups of sifted flour, and add quickly. 
Bake in a moderate oven, in layers hke jeUy-cake, and when done, spread cus- 
tard between. 

For the Custard. — Take two cups of sweet milk, put it into a clean suitable 
dish, set it in a dish of boiling water on the range or stove. When the milk 
comes to a boil, add two tablespoonfuls of corn-starch or flour stirred into half a 
cup of sugar, adding the yolks of four eggs, and a httle cold mOk. Stir this into 
the boiling mfik, and when cooked thick enough, set aside to cool; afterwards 
add the flavoring, either vamlla or lemon. It is best to make the custard first, 
before making the cake part. 

HICKORY NUT OR WALNUT CAKE. 
Two cups of fine, white sugar, creamed with half a cup of butter, thres eggs, 
two-thirds of a cup of sweet milk, three cups of sifted flour, one heaping tea- 
spoonful of baking powder sifted through the flour. A tablespoonful (level) of 



272 CAKES. 

powdered mace, a coffee-cup of hickory nut or*walnut meats, chopped a little. 
Fill the cake pans with a layer of the cake, then a layer of raisins upon that, 
then strew over these a handful of nuts, and so on until the pan is two-thirds 
full. Line the tins with well-buttered paper, and bake in a steady but not quick 
oven. This is most excellent. 

CHEAP CREAM CAKE. 

One cup of sugar, one egg, one cup sweet milk, two cups flour, one table- 
spoonful butter, two heaping teaspoonfuls of baking-powder; flavor to taste. 
Divide into three parts, and bake in round shallow pans. 

Creoum. — Beat one egg and one half cup sugar together, then add one quarter 
cup flour, wet with a very little milk, and stir this mixture into one half pint of 
boiling milk, until thick; flavor to taste. Spread the cream when cool between 
the cakes. 

SOFT GINGER CAKE. 

Stir to a cream one cupful of butter and half a cupful of brown sugar; add to 
this two cupfuls of cooking molasses, a cupful of sweet milk, a tablespoonful of 
ginger, a teaspoonful of ground cinnamon; beat all thoroughly together, then 
add three eggs, the whites and yolks beaten separately; beat into this two cups 
of sifted flour, then a teaspoonful of soda, dissolved in a spoonful of water, and 
last, two more cupfuls of sifted flour. Butter and paper two commonlequare 
bread-pans, divide the mixture and pour half into each. Bake in a moderate 
oven. This cake requires long and slow baking, from forty to sixty minutes. 
I find that if sour milk is used, the cakes are much lighter, but either sweet or 
sour is most excellent. 

HARD GINGERBREAD. 

Made the same as " Soft Gingerbread," omitting the eggs, and mixing hard 
enough to roll out Uke biscuit; rolled nearly half an inch thick, and cut out Hke 
small biscuits, or it can be baked in a sheet or on a biscmt-tin; cut sUts a quarter 
of an inch deep across the top of the tin from side to side. When baked and 
while hot, rub over the top with molasses, and let it dry on. 

These two above recipes are the best I have ever found among a large variety 
that I have tried, the ingredients giving the best proportion for flavor and 
excellence. 

PLAIN GINGERBREAD. 

One cup of dAirk cooking molasses, one cup of sour cream, one egg, one tea^ 
spoonful of soda, dissolved in a Uttle warm water, a teaspoonful of salt, and one 
heaping teaspoonful of ginger; make about as thick as cup-cake. To be eaten 
warm.

The grated rind and the juice of an orange add much to the flavor of ginger 

GOLD AND SILVER CAKE. 

This cake is baked in layers like jelly-cake. Divide the silver-cake batter, and 
color it pink with a httle cochineal; this gives you pink, white and yellow layers. 
Put together with frosting. Frost the top. 

This can be put together Uke marble cake, first a spoonful of one kind, then 
another, until the dish is full. 

BOSTON CREAM CAKES. 

Put into a large-sized sauce-pan half a cup of butter, and one cup of hot 
water; set it on the fire; when the mixture begins to boU, turn in a pint of sifted 
flour at once, beat and work it well with a vegetable-masher until it is very 
smooth. Eemove from the fire, and when cool enough add five eggs that have 
been well beaten, first the yolks and then the whites, also half a teaspoonful of 
soda and a teaspoonful of salt. Drop on buttered tins in large spoonfuls, about 
two inches apart. Bake in a quick oven about fifteen minutes. When done 
and quite cold, open them on the side with a knife or scissors, and put in as much 
of the custard as possible.

half cup of corn-starch), and one cup of sugar. Put two-thirds of a pint of mik 
over the fire in a double boiler, in a third of a pint of milk; stir the sugar, flour

be covered with a meringue made with the white of an egg and a tablespoonful 
of powdered sugar. 

Save out the largest berries, and arrange them around in circles on the top in 
the white frosting. Makes a very fancy dish, as well as a most delicious cake.

CAKES. 275 

sift four cups of flour and stir part of it into the above mixtvire. Now dissolve 
a teaspoonful of soda in a tablespoonful of warm water and beat into this mix- 
ture, stir in the remainder of the flour, and make stiff enough to roll into long 
rolls about one inch in diameter, and cut off from the end into half -inch pieces. 
Place them on weU-buttered tins, giving plenty of room to spread. Bake in a 
moderate oven. Let them cool before taking out of the tins. 

GINGER COOKIES. 

One cup sugar, one cup molasses, one cup butter, one egg, one tablespoonful 
vinegar, one tablespoonful ginger, one teaspoonful soda, dissolved in boiling 
water, mix like cookey dough, rather soft. 

GINGER SNAPS. 
One cup brown sugar, two cups molasses, one large cup butter, two tea- 
spoonfuls soda, two teaspoonfuls ginger, three pints floiu" to commence with; 
rub shortening and sugar together into the flour; add enough more flour to roU 
very smooth, very thin, and bake in a quick oven. The dough can be kept for 
days by putting it in the flour-barrel under the flour, and bake a few at a time. 
The more flour that can be worked in and the smoother they can be roUed, the 
better and more brittle they will be. Should be rolled out to wafer-Hke thin- 
ness. Bake quickly without burmng. They should become perfectly cold before 
putting aside. 

DOMINOES. 

Have a plain cake baked in rather thin sheets, and cut into small oblong 
pieces the size and shape of a domino, a trifle larger. Frost the top and sides. 
When the frosting is hard, draw the black lines and make the dots, with a smaU 
brush dipped in melted chocolate. These are very nice for children's parties. 

FANCY CAKES. 
These deUcious httle fancy cakes may be made by making a rich jumble- 
paste — rolhng out in any desired shape; cut some paste in thick, narrow strips 
and lay around your cakes, so as to form a deep, cup-Uke edge; place on a weU- 
buttered tin and bake. When done, fill with iced fruit, prepared as follows: 
Take rich, ripe peaches (canned nes will do, if fine and well-drained from all 
juice), cut in halves; plums, strawberries, pineapples cut in squares, or smaU 
triangles, or any other available fruit, and dip in the white of an egg that has 
been very sUghtly beaten and then in piflverized sugar, and lay in the centre of 
your cakes

WAFERS. 

Dissolve four ounces of butter in half a teacup of milk; stir together four 
ounces of white sugar, eight ounces of sifted flour, and the yolk of one egg, add- 
ing gradually the butter and mDk, a tablespoonful of orange-flower water, and 
a pinch of salt; mix it well. Heat the wafer-irons, butter their umer surfaces, 
put in a tablespoonful of the batter, and close the irons immediately; put the 
irons over the fire, and turn them occasionally, until the wafer is cooked; when 
the wafers are aU cooked, roU them on a small round stick, stand them upon a 
sieve, and dry them; serve with ices. 

PEACH CAKES. • 

Take the yolks and whites of five eggs and beat them separately (the whites 
to a stiff froth). Then mix the beaten yolks with half a pound of pulverized and 
sifted loaf or crushed sugar, and beat the two together thoroughly. Fifteen 
minutes will be none too long for the latter operation if you would have excel- 
lence with your cakes. 

Now add half a pound of fine flour, dredging it in a little at a time, and then 
put in the whites of the eggs, beating the whole together for four or five minutes- 
Then with a large spoon, drop the batter upon a baking-tin, which has been 
buttered and fioured, being careful to have the cakes as nearly the same size as 
possible, and resembling in shape the half of a peach. Have a quick oven ready, 
and bake the cakes about ten minutes, watching them closely so that they may 
only come to a Ught brown color. Then take them out, spread the fiat side of 
each with peach jam, and stick them together in pairs, covering the outside with 
a thin coat of icing, which when dry can be brushed over on one side of the 
cake, with a little cochineal water. 

CUP CAKES. 

Two cups of sugar, one cup of butter, one cup of milk, three cups and a half 
of flour, and four eggs, half a teaspoonful of soda, large spoon cream tartar; stir 
butter and sugar together, and add the beaten yolks of the eggs, then the milk, 
then flavoring, and the whites. Put cream tartar in flour and add last. Bake 
in buttered gem-pans, or drop the batter, a teaspoonful at a time, in rows, on 
flat buttered tins. 

To this recipe maybe added a cup of English currants or chopped raisins; 
and a^o another variety of cakes may be made by adding a half cup of citron 
sficed and floured, a half -cupful of chopped almonds, and lemon extract.

half cups of prepared flour. Bitter almond flavoring, spinach juice and cochineal. 
Cream, the butter and sugar; add the milk, flavoring, the whites and flour. 
Divide the batter into three parts. Bruise and pound a few leaves of spinach ia 
a thin muslin bag imtil you can express the juice. Put a few drops of this into 
one portion of the batter, color another with cochineal, leaving the third white. 
Put a little of each into small, roimd pans or cups, giving a light stir to each 
color as you add the next. This will vein the cakes prettily. Put the white 
between the pink and green, that the tints may show better. If you can get 
pistachio nuts to pound up for the green, the cakes will be much nicer. Ice on 
sides and top. 

CORN STARCH CAKES. 

One cupful each of butter and sweet milk, and half a cup of corn-starch, two 
cupfuls each of sugar and flour, the whites of five eggs beaten to a stiff froth, 
two teaspoonfuls of cream of tartar and one of soda; flavor to taste. Bake in 
gem-tins or patty -pans. 

SPONGE DROPS. 

Beat to a froth three eggs and one teacup of sugar; stir into this one heaping 
coffee-cup of flour, in which one teaspoonful of cream of tartar and half a tea- 
spoonful of saleratus are thoroughly mixed. Flavor with lemon. Butter tin 
sheets with washed butter, and drop in teaspoonfuls about three inches apart. 
Bake instantly in a very quick oven. Watch closely as they will burn easily. 
Serve with ice cream. 

SAVORY BISCUITS OR LADY FINGERS. 
Put nine tablespoonfuls of fine white sugar into a bowl, and put the bowl 
into hot water to heat the sugar; when the sugar is thoroughly heated, break 
nine eggs into the bowl and beat them quickly until they become a httle warm 
and rather thick; then take the bowl from the water, and continue beating tmtil 
it is nearly or quite cold; now stir in Ughtly nine tablespoonfuls of sifted flour; 
then with a paper-funnel, or something of the kind, lay this mixture out upon 
papers, in biscuits three inches long and half an inch thick, in the form of 
fingers; sift sugar over the biscuits, and bake them upon tins to a ligbt brown; 
when they are done and cold, remove them from the papers, by wetting them

on the back; dry them, and they are ready for use. They are often used in 
making Charlotte Eusse. 

PASTRY SANDWICHES. 

Puff-paste, jam of any kind, the white of an egg, sifted sugar. 

Eoll the paste out thin; put half of it on a baking-sheet or tin, and spread 
equally over it apricot, greengage, or any preserve that may be preferred. Lay 
over this preserve another thin paste, press the edges together all round, and 
mark the paste in hues with a knife on the surface, to show where to cut it 
when baked. Bake from twenty minutes to half an hour; and, a short time 
before being done, take the pastry out of the oven, brush it over with the white 
of an egg, sift over pounded sugar, and put it back in the oven to color. When 
cold, cut it iato strips; pile these on a dish pyramidicaUy, and serve. 

This may be made of jeUy-cake dough, and, after baking, allowed to cool 
before spreading with the preserve; either way is good, as well as fanciful. 

NEAPOLITAINES. 
One cup of powdered sugar, haK a cup of butter, two tablespoonf uls of lemon- 
juice, three whole eggs, and three yolks, beaten separately; three cups of sifted 
flour. Put this aU together with half a teaspoonf ul of soda, dissolved in a table- 
spoonfiil of milk. If it is too stiff to roU out, add just enough more milk. RoU 
it out a quarter of an inch thick, and cut it out with any tin cutter. Place the 
cakes in a pan sUghtly gi-eased, and color the tops with beaten egg and nulk, 
with some chopped almonds over them. Bake in a rather quick oven. 

BRUNSWICK JELLV CAKES. 

Stir one cup of powdered white sugar, and one half cup of butter together, till 
perfectly Ught; beat the yolks of three eggs till very thick and smooth; sift three 
cups of flour, and stir it into the beaten eggs with the butter and sugar; add a 
teaspoonf ul of mixed spice (nutmeg, mace and cinnamon) and haK a glass of 
rose-water or wine; stir the whole well, and lay it on your paste-board, which 
must first be sprinkled with flour; if you find it so moist as to be unmanageable, 
throw in a httle more flour; spread the dough into a sheet about half an inch 
thick, and cut it out in round cakes with a biscuit-cutter; lay them in buttered 
pans and bake about five or six minutes; when cold, spread over the surface of 
each cake a Uquor of fruit-jeUy or marmalade; then beat the whites of three or 
four eggs tin it stands alone; beat into the froth, by degrees, a sufficiency of 
powdered loaf-sugar to make it as thick as icing; flavor with a few drops of 
strong essence of lemon, and with a spoon heap it up on each cake, making it

high in the centre; put the cakes into a coal oven, and as soon as the tops are 
colored a pale brown, take them out. 

LITTLE PLUM CAKES. 
One cup of sugar and half a cup of butter, beaten to a smooth cream; add 
three weU-beaten eggs, a teaspoonful of vamlla extract, four cups of sifted flour, 
one cup of raisins, and one of currants, half of a teaspoonful of baking-soda, 
dissolved in a httle water, and milk enough to make a stiff batter; drop this 
batter in drops on well-buttered tins, and bake in a quick oven. 

JUMBLES. 
Cream together two cups of sugar and one of butter, add three wek-beaten 
eggs and six tablespoonfuls of sweet nulk, two teaspoonfuls of baking-powder, 
flavor to taste; flour enough to make into a soft dough; do not roll it on the 
paste-board, but break off pieces of dough the size of a walnut and make into 
rings by rolling out roUs as large as your tmger, and joining the ends; lay them 
on tins to bake, an inch apart, as it rises and spreads; bake in a moderate oven. 
These jumbles are very dehcate, will keep a long time. 

WINE JUMBLES. 
One cup of butter, two of sugar, three eggs, one wine-glass of wine, one 
spoonful of vanilla, and flour enough to roll out. EoU as thin as the blade of a 
knife, and cut with an oval cutter. Bake on tin-sheets, in a quick oven, until a 
dark brown. These wiU keep a year if kept in a tin box and in a dry place. 

COCOANUT JUMBLES. 
Grate one large cupful of cocoanut; rub one cupful of butter with one and a 
half cupfuls of sugar; add three beaten eggs, whites and yolks separately, two 
tablespoonfuls of nulk, and five cupfiils of sifted flour; then add by degrees the 
grated nut, so as to make a stiff dough, rolled thin, and cut with a round cutter, 
having a hole in the middle. Bake in a quick oven from five to ten minutes. 

PHILADELPHIA JUMBLES. 

Two cups of sugar, one cup of butter, eight eggs, beaten light; essence ol 
bitter almond or rose to taste; enough flour to enable you to roU them out. 

Stir the sugar and butter to a hght cream, then add the well- whipped eggs, 
the flavoring and flour; mix well together, roU out in powdered sugar, roU in a 
sheet a quarter of an inch thick; cut into rings with a jagging-iron, and bake in 
a quick oven on buttered tins.

one teaspoonful of soda, dissolved in boiling water; 

Cream, butter and sugar; stir in the beaten yolks the milk, flour, rose-water, 
almouds, and, lastly, the beaten whites very Ughtly, and quickly; drop in rings 
on buttered paper, and bake at once. 

FRUIT JUMBLES. 
Two cups of sugar, one cup of butter, five cupfuls of flour, five eggs, one 
small teacupful of nulk, in which dissolve half a teaspoonful of soda; cream the

grated Qutmeg, and five cups of sifted flour, in which there has been sifted with 
it two teaspoonfuls of baking-powder ; mix into a soft dough, and cut into 
round cakes; roll the dough as thia as pie-crust. Bake in a quick oven a hght- 
brown. These can be made of sour milk and a teaspoonful of soda dissolved in 
it, or sour or sweet cream can be used in place of butter. 

Water cookies made the same as above, using water in place of milk. Water 
cookies keep longer than nulk cookies. 

FAVORITE COOKIES. 
One cup of butter, one and a haK cups of sugar, one half cup of sour milk, 
one level teaspoonful of soda, a teaspoonful of grated nutmeg. Mour enough to

CRISP COOKIES. (Very Nice.) 
One cup of butter, two cups of sugar, three eggs -well-beaten, a teaspoonfuj 
of soda and two of cream tartar, spoonful of milk:, one teaspoonful of nutmeg, 
and one of cinnamon. Flour enough to make a soft dough just stiff enough to 
roll out. Try a pint of sifted flour to begin with, working it in gradually. 
Spread a httle sweet milk over each, and sprinkle with sugar. Bake in a quick 
oven a hght brown. 

LEMON COOKIES. 

Four cups of sifted flour, or enough for a stiff dough; one teacupful of butter, 
two cups of sugar, the juice of one lemon, and the grated peel from the outside, 
three eggs, whipped very hght. Beat thoroughly each ingredient, addiag after 
aU is in a half teaspoonful of soda, dissolved in a tablespoonful of milk. Eoll 
out as any cookies, and bake a hght brown. Use no other wetting. 

COCOANUT COOKIES. 

One cup grated cocoanut, one and one-half cups sugar, three-fourths cup 
butter, one-half cup milk, two eggs, one large teaspoonful baking-powder, one- 
half teaspoonful extract of vanilla, and flour enough to roU out. 

DOUGHNUTS OR FRIED CAKES. 

Success in making good fried cakes depends as much on the cooking as the 
mixing. In the first place, there should be boiling lard enough to free them 
from the bottom of the kettle, so that they swim on the top, and the lard should 
never be so hot as to smoke or so cool as not to be at the boiling point; if it is, 
they soak grease, and are spoiled. If it is at the right heat, the doughnuts will 
in about ten minutes be of a delicate brown outside and nicely cooked inside. 
Five or six minutes will cook a cruller. Try the fat by dropping a bit of the 
dough in first; if it is right, the fat will boil up when it is dropped in. They 
shoiild be turned over almost constantly, which causes them to rise and brown 
evenly. When they are sufficiently cooked, raise them from the hot fat, and 
drain them imtil every drop ceases dripping. 

CRULLERS OR FRIED CAKES. 
One and a half cupfiils of sugar, one cupful of sour milk, two eggs, two 
scant tablespoonfuls of melted butter, half a nutmeg grated, a large teaspoonful 
of cinnamon, a teaspoonful of salt, and one of soda; make a little stiff er than 
biscuit dough, roU out a quarter of an inch thick, and cut with a fried-cake 
cutter, with a hole in the centre. Fry in hot lard. 



282 CAKES. 

These can be made with sweet milk and baking-powder, using two heaping 
teaspoonfuls of the baking-powder in place of soda. 

RAISED DOUGHNUTS. 
Old-fashioned "raised doughnuts," are seldom seen, now-a-days, but are 
easily made. Make a sponge as for bread, using a pint of warm water or mUk, 
and a large half cupful of yeast; when the sponge is very light, add half a cupful 
of butter or sweet lard, a coffee-cupful of sugar, a teaspoonful of salt and one 
smaU teaspoonful of soda, dissolved in a Uttle water, one tablespoonful of cinna- 
mon, a httle grated nutmeg; stir in now two weU-beaten eggs, add sifted flour 
until it is the consistency of biscuit -dough, knead it weU, cover and let rise; then 
roll the dough out into a sheet half an inch thick, cut out with a very small 
biscuit-cutter, or in strips half an inch wide and three inches long, place them 
on greased tins, cover them well, and let them rise before frying them. Drop 
them in very hot lard. Eaised cakes require longer time than cakes made with 
baking-powder. Sift powdered sugar over them as fast as they are fried, while 
warm. Our grandmothers put allspice into these cakes; that, however, is a 
matter of taste. 

BAKERS' RAISED DOUGHNUTS. 

Warm a teacupful of lard in a pint of milk; when nearly cool, add enough 
flour to make a thick batter, and add a small cupful of yeast; beat it well, and 
set it to rise; when hght, work in gradually and carefully three cupfuls of sugar, 
the whipped whites of six eggs, half a teaspoonful of soda, dissolved in a spoon- 
ful of mUk; one teaspoonful of salt, a teaspoonful of ground cinnamon, and half 
of a nutmeg grated; then work in gradually enough flour to make it stiff enough to 
roU out; let it rise again, and when very hght, roU it out in a sheet an inch thick; 
cut into rounds; put into the centre of each round a large Sultana raisin, seeded, 
and mold into perfectly round balls ; flatten a httle; let them stand a few minutes 
before boiling them; have plenty of lard in the pot, and when it boils drop in the 
cakes; when they are a hght brown, take them out with a perforated skimmer; 
drain on soft white paper, and roU, while warm, in fine powdered sugar.

CRULLERS OR WONDERS. 

Three eggs, three tablespoonfuls of melted lard or butter, three tablespoon- 

fuls of sugar, mix very hard with sifted flour, as hard as cain be roUed, and to 

be rolled very thin hke pie-crust; cut in squares three inches long and two wide, 

then cut several shts or lines lengthwise, to within a quarter of an inch of the

edges of tlje ends; run your two forefingers through every other slit; lay them 
down on the board edgewise, and dent them. These are very dainty when fried. 
Fry in hot lard a light brown. 

GERMAN DOUGHNUTS. 
One pint of nulk, four eggs, one small tablespoonful of melted butter, flavor- 
ing, salt to taste; first boil the mUk and pour it, while hot, over a pint of flour; 
beat it very smooth, and when it is cool, have ready the yolks of the eggs well- 
beaten; add them to the milk and flour, beaten well into it, then add the 
weU-beaten whites, then lastly add the salt and as much more flom- as will make 
the whole into a soft dough; flour your board, turn your dough upon it, roll it 
in pieces as thick as your finger and turn them in the form of a ring; cook in 
plenty of boiling lard. A nice breakfast cake with coffee. 

NUT CAKES (Fried.) 

Beat two eggs well, add to them one ounce of sifted sugar, two ounces of 
warmed butter, two tablespoonfuls of yeast, a teacupful of luke-warm milk and 
a little salt. Whip aU weU together, then stir in by degrees one pound of flour, 
and, if requisite, more milk, making thin dough. Beat it until it falls from 
the spoon, then set it to rise. When it has risen, make butter or lard hot in a 
frying-pan; cut from the light dough little pieces the size of a walnut, and with- 
out molding or kneading, fry them pale brown. As they are done, lay theia. 
on a napkin to absorb any of the fat. 

TRIFLES. 

Work one egg and a tablespoonful of sugar to as much flour as wiU make a 
stiff paste; roU it as thin as a dollar piece, and cut it into small round or squara 
cakes; drop two or three at a time into the boihng lard; when they rise to the 
surface and turn over they are done; take them out with a skimmer and lay 
them on an inverted sieve to drain. When served for dessert or supper, put a 
spoonful of jelly on each. 

PUFF-BALL DOUGHNUTS. 

These doughnuts, eaten fresh and warm, are a deUcious breakfast dish, and 
are quickly made. Three eggs, one cupful of sugar, a pint of sweet milk, salt, 
nutmeg, and flour enough to permit the spoon to stand upright in the mixture; 
add two heaping teaspoonfuls of baking-powder to the flour; beat aU until very 
light. Drop by the dessertspoonful into boihng lard. These will not absorb a 
bit of fat, and are not at aU rich, and consequently are the least injurious of this 
kind of cakes. ^^ 



GENERAL REMARKS. 

Use the very best materials in making pastry; the shortening should be fresh, 
sweet, and hard; the water cold (ice water is best), the paste roUed on a cold 
board, and aU handled as little as possible. 

When the crust is made, it makes it much more flakey and puff much more 
to put it in a dish coTered with a cloth, and set in a very cold place for half an 
hour, or even an hour; in summer, it could be placed in the ice box. 

A great improvement is made in pie-crust by the addition of about a heaping 
teaspoonful of baking-powder to a quart of flour, also brushing the paste as often 
as roUed out, and the pieces of butter placed thereon, with the white of an egg, 
assists it to rise in leaves or flakes. As this is the great beauty of puff -paste, it 
is as weU to try this method. 

If currants are to be used in pies, they should be carefuUy picked over, and 
washed iu several waters, dried in a towel, and dredged with floiu" before they 
are suitable for use. 

Eaisins, and aU dried fruits for pies and cakes, should be seeded, stoned, and 
dredged with flour, before using. 

Almonds should be blanched by pouring boiling water upon them, and then 
slipping the skin off with the fingers. In pounding them, always add a little 
rose or orange water, with fine sugar, to prevent their becoming oUy. 

Great care is requisite in heating an oven for baking pastry. If you can 
hold your hand in the heated oven while you coimt twenty, the oven has just 
the proper temperature, and it should be kept at this temperature as long as the 
pastry is in; this heat wiU bake to a light brown, and will give the pastry a 
fresh and flakey appearance. If you suffer the heat to abate, the under crust 
wJl become heavy and clammy, and the upper crust wiU fall in. 



PASTRY, PIES AND TARTS. 285 

Another good way to ascertain when the oven is heated to the proper degree 
for puff-paste: put a small piece of the paste in previous to baking the whole, 
and then the heat can thus be judged of. 

Pie-crust can be kept a week, and the last be better than the first, if put in a 
tightly covered dish, and set ia the ice-chest in summer, and in a cool place in 
winter, and thus you can make a fresh pie every day with little trouble. 

In bakiiig custard, pumpkin or squash pies, it is well, iu order that the mix- 
ture may not be absorbed by the paste, to first partly bake the paste before add- 
ing it, and when stewed fruit is used the filling should be perfectly cool when 
put in, or it will make the bottom crust sodden. 

HOW TO MAKE A PIE. 

After making the crust, take a portion of it, roU it out and fit it to a buttered 
pio-plate by cutting it off evenly around the edge; gather up the scraps left from 
cutting and make into another sheet for the top crust; roll it a little thinner than 
the under crust; lap one half over the other and cut three or four slits about a 
quarter of an inch from the folded edge, (this prevents the steam from escaping 
through the rim of the pie, and causing the juices to run out from the edges). 
Now fill your pie-plate with your prepared filling, wet the top edge of the rim, 
lay the upper crust across the centre of the pie, turn back the half that is lapped 
over, seal the two edges together by shghtly pressing down with your thumb, 
then notch evenly and regiilarly with a three-tined fork, dipping occasionally in 
flour to prevent sticking. Bake in a rather quick oven a light brown, and untU 
the filling boils up through the sUts in the upper crust. 

To prevent the juice soaking through into the crust, making it soggy, wet 
the under crust with the white of an egg, just before you put in the pis mixture. 
If the top of the pie is brushed over with the egg, it gives it a beautifxil glaze. 

FOR ICING PASTRY. 

To ice pastry, which is the usual method adopted for fruit tarts and sweet 
dishes of pastry, put the white of an egg on a plate, and with the blade of a 
knife beat it to a stiff froth. When the pastry is nearly baked, brush it over 
with this, and sift over some pounded sugar; put it back into the oven to set the 
glaze, and in a few minutes it will be done. Great care should be taken that 
the paste does not catch or bum in the oven, which it is very liable to do after 
the icing is laid on. 

Or make a meringue by adding a tablespoonful of white sugar to the beaten 
white of one egg. Spread over the top, and slightly brown in the oven.

FINE PUFF-PASTE. 

Into one quart of sifted flour, mix two teaspoonfuls of baking-powder, and 
a teaspoonful of salt; then sift again. Measure out one teacupful of butter 
and one of lard, hard and cold. Take the lard and rub into the flour until a very- 
fine, smooth paste. Then put in just enough ice-water, say half a cupful, con- 
taining a beaten white of egg, to mix a very stiff dough. EoU it out into a 
thin sheet, spread with one-fourth of the butter, sprinkle over with a httle flour, 
then roll up closely in a long roll, like a scroll, double the ends towards the 
centre, flatten and reroU, then spread again with another quarter of the butter. 
Eepeat this operation until the butter is used up. Put it on an earthen dish, 
cover it with a cloth and set it in a cold place, in the ice-box in summer; let it 
remain until cold; an hour or more before making out the crust. Tarts made 
with this paste cannot be cut with a knife when fresh; they go into flakes at the 
touch. 

You may roU this pastry in any direction, from you, towards you, sideways, 
anyway, it matters not, but you must have nice flour, ice-water, and very little 
of it, asiA strength to roU it, if you would succeed. 

This recipe I purchased from a colored cook on one of the Lake Michigan 
steamers many years ago, and it is, without exception, the finest puff -paste I 
have ever seen. 

PUFF-PASTE FOR PIES. 

One quart of pastry flour, one pint of butter, one tablespoonful of salt, one 
of sugar, one and a quarter cupfuls of ice- water. Wash the hands with soap 
and water, and dip them first in very hot, and then in cold water. Einse a large 
bowl or pan with boiling water, and then with cold. Half fill it with cold water. 
Wash the butter in this, working it with the hands until it is light and waxy. 
This frees it from the salt and buttermilk, and hghtens it, so that the pastry is 
more deUcate. Shape the butter into two thin cakes, and put in a pan of ice- 
water to harden. Mix the salt and sugar with the fiom-. With the hands, rub 
one-third of the butter into the flour. Add the water, stirring with a knife. 
Stir quickly and vigorously, until the paste is a smooth baU. Sprinkle the board 
lightly with flour. Turn the paste on this and pound quickly and hghtly with 
the roUing-pin. Do not break the paste. EoU from you, and to one side; or, if 
, easier to roU from you aU the time, turn the paste around. When it is about 
one-fourth of an inch thick, wipe the remaining butter, break it in bits, and 
spread these on the paste. Sprinkle hghtly with floiu-. Fold the paste, one- 
third from each side, so that the edges meet. Now fold from the ends, but do 



PASTRY, PIES AND TARTS. 287 

not have these meet. Double the paste, pound hghtly, and roll down to about 
one-third of an inch in thickness. Fold as before, and roU down again. Eepeat 
this three times, if for pies, and six times if for vol-au-vents, patties, tarts, etc. 
Place on the ice, to harden, when it has been roUed the last time. It should be 
in the ice-chest at least an hour before being used. In hot weather, if the paste 
sticks when being rolled down, put it on a tin sheet, and place on ice. As soon 
as it is chUled, it will roU easily. The less flour you use in roUing out the paste, 
the tenderer it wiU be. No matter how carefully every part of the work may 
be done, the paste will not be good if much flour is used.

SOYER'S RECIPE FOR PUFF-PASTE. 

To every pound of flom* allow the yolk of one egg, the juice of one lemon, 
half a saltspoonful of salt, cold water, one pound of fresh butter. 

Put the floTu- on to the paste-board; make a hole in the centre, into which 
put the yolk of the egg, the lemon-juice, and salt; mix the whole with cold 
water (this should be iced in summer, if convenient) into a soft, flexible paste 
with the right hand, and handle it as httle as possible; then squeeze all the 
buttermilk from the butter, wring it in a cloth, and roU out the paste; place the 
butter on this, and fold the edges of the paste over, so as to hide it; roll it out 
again, to the thickness of a quarter of an inch; fold over one-thh'd, over which 
again pass the rolling-pin; then fold over the other third, thus forming a 
square; place it with the ends, top, and bottom before you, shaking a little flour 
both under and over, and repeat the rolls and turns twice again, as before. 
Flour a baking sheet, put the paste on this, and let it remain on ice or in some 
cool place for half an hour; then roU twice more, turning it as before; place it 
again upon the ice for a quarter of an hour, give it two more roUs, making seven 
in all, and it is ready for use when required. 

RULE FOR UNDER CRUST. 

A good rule for pie-crust for a pie requiring only an under crust, — as a custard 
or pumpkin pie, — is: Three large tablespoonfuls of flour sifted; rubbing into it a 
large tablespoonful of cold butter, or part butter and part lard, and a pinch of 
salt, mixing with cold water enough to form a smooth, stiff paste, and rolled 
quite thin. 

PLAIN PIE-CRUST. 

Two and a half cupfuls of sifted flour, one cupful of shortening, half butter 
and half lard, cold; a pinch of salt, a heaping teaspoonful of baking-powder, 



288 PASTRY, PIES AND TARTS. 

sifted through the flom-. Eub thoroughlf the shortening into the flour. Mix 
together with half a teacupful of cold water, or enough to form a rather stiff 
dough; mix as httle as possible, just enough to get it into shape to roll out; it 
must be handled very Ughtly. This rule is for two pies. 

When you have a httle pie-crust left, do not throw it away; roll it thin, cut 
it in small squares and bake. Just before tea, put a spoonful of raspberry jelly 
on eacii square. 

PUFF-PASTE OF SUET. 

Two cupfuls of flour, one-half teaspoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of baking- 
powder, one cup of chopped suet, freed of skin, and chopped very flne, one cup- 
ful of water. Place the flour, sifted with the powder, in a bowl, add suet and 
water; mix into smooth, rather firm dough. 

This paste is excellent for fruit puddings, and dumplings that are boiled; if it 
is well made, it wiU be hght and flaky, and the suet imperceptible. It is also 
excellent for meat pies, baked or boiled. All the ingredients should be very cold 
when mixing, and the suet dredged with flour after it is chopped, to prevent the 
particles from adhering to each other. 

POTATO CRUST. 

Bofl and mash a dozen medium-sized potatoes, add one good teaspoonful of 
salt, two tablespoonfuls of cold butter, and half a cupful of milk or cream. 
Stiffen with flour sufficient to roll out. Nice for the tops of meat pies. 

TO MAKE PIE-CRUST FLAKY 
In making a pie, after you have rolled out your top crust, cut it about the 
right size, spread it over with butter, then shake sifted flour over the butter, 
enough to cover it weU. Cut a slit in the middle, place it over the top of your 
pie, and fasten the edges as any pie. Now take the pie on your left hand, and a 
dipper of cold water in yoiu- right hand; tip the pie slanting a little, pour over 
the water sufficiently to rinse off the flour. Enough flour will stick to the 
butter to fry into the crust, to give it a fine, bhstered, flaky look, which many 
cooks think is much better than rolling the butter into the crust. 

TARTLETS. 

Tarts of strawberry or any other kind of preserves are generaUy made of the 

trimmings of puff -paste roUed a httle thicker than for ordinary pies; then cut 

out with a round cutter, first dipped in hot water, to make the edges smooth, 

and placed in small tart-pans, first pricking a few holes at the bottom with a 



PASTRY, PIES AND TARTS. 289 

fork before placing them in the oven. Bake from ten to fifteen minutes. Let 
the paste cool' a httle; then flU it with preserve. By this manner, both the 
flavor and color of the jam are preserved, which would be lost were it baked in 
the oven on the paste; and, besides, so much jam is not required 

PATTIES, OR SHELLS FOR TARTS. 

EoU out a nice puff -paste thin; cut out with a glass or cookey-cutter, and with 
a wine-glass or smaller cutter, cut out the centre of two out of three; lay the 
rings thus made on the third, and bake at once. May be used for veal or oyster 
patties, or flUed with jeUy, jam or preserves, as tarts. Or sheUs may be made 
by lining patty -pans with paste. If the paste is light, the shells will be fine. 
FOled with jelly and covered with meringue (tablespoonful of sugar to the white 
of one egg), and browned in oven, they are very nice to serve for tea. 

If the cutters are dipped in hot water, the edges of the tartlets wiU rise much 
higher and smoother when baking. 

TARTLETS. 

Tartlets are nice made in this manner: EoU some good puff-paste out thin, 
and cut it into two and a half inch squares; brush each square over with the 
white of an egg, then fold down the comers, so that they aU meet in the middle 
of each piece of paste; sHghtly press the two pieces together, brush them over 
with the egg, sift over sugar, and bake in a nice quick oven for about a quarter 
of an hour. When they are done, make a little hole in the middle of the paste, 
and fill it up with apricot jam, marmalade, or red-currant jelly. Pile them high 
in the centre of a dish, on a napkin, and garnish with the same preserve the 
tartlets are filled with. 

TARTS. 

Larger pans are required for tarts proper, the size of smaU, shallow pie-tins; 
then after the paste is baked and cooled and filled with the jam or preserve, a 
few stars or leaves are placed on the top, or strips of paste, criss-crossed on the 
top, aU of which have been previously baked on a tin by themselves. 

Dried fruit, stewed until thick, makes fine tart pies, aiso cranberries, stewed 
and weU sweetened. 

GREEN APPLE PIE. 

Peel, core and slice tart apples enough for a pie; sprinkle over about three 
tablespoonfuls of sugar, a teaspoonful of cinnamon, a small level tablespoonful

pound of the grated cocoanut, allow a quart of milk, eight eggs, fom* table- 
spoonfuls of sifted white sugar, a glass of wiae, a small cracker, pounded fine, 
two spoonfuls of melted butter, and half a nutmeg. The eggs and sugar should 
be beaten together to a froth, then the wine stirred in. Put them into the milk

LEMON PIE. (Superior.) 

Take a deep dish, grate into it the outsidls of the rind of two lemons; add to 

that a cup and a half of white sugar, two heaping tablespoonfuls of unsifted 

flour, or one of corn-starch; stir it weU together, then add the ydks of three 

well-beaten eggs, beat this thoroughly, then add the juice of the lemons, two cups 

of water, and a piece of butter the size of a walnut. Set this on the fire in 

another dish containing boHing water and cook it until it thickens, and will dip 

up on the spoon hke cold honey. Eemove it from the fire, and when cooled, 

pour it into a deep pie-tin, lined with pastry; bake, and when done, have ready 

the whites, beaten stiff, with three small tablespoonfuls of sugar. Spread this 

over the top and return to the oven to set and brown shghtly. This makes a 

deep, large-sized pie, and very superior. 

'—Ehhitt Bouse, Washington. 

LEMON PIE. No. 2. 

One coffee-cupful of sugar, three eggs, one cupful of water, one tablespoonful 
of melted butter, one heaping tablespoonful of flour, the juice and a httle .of 
the rind of one lemon. Eeserve the whites of the eggs, and after the pie is 
baked, spread them over the top, beaten hghtly, with a spoonful of sugar, and 
return to the oven until it is a light brown. 

This may be cooked before it is put into the crust or not, but is rather better 
to cook it first in a double boiler or dish. It makes a medium -sized pie. BS,ke 
from thirty-five to forty minutes. 

LEMON PIE. No. 3. 

Moisten a heaping tablespoonful of corn-starch with a httle cold water, then 
add a cupful of boUing water; stir over the fire till it boils and cook the corn- 
starch, say two or three minutes; add a teaspoonful of butter, and a fcupful of 
sugar; take off the fire, and when shghtly cooled, add an egg well beaten, and 
the juice and grated rind of a ^esh lemon. Bake with a cacust. This makes one 
small pie. 

LEMON PIE. No. 4. 

Two large, fresh lemons, grate off the rind, if not bitter reserve it for the 
filling of the pie; pare off every bit of the white skin of the lemon, (as it toughens 



PASTRY, PIES AND TARTS. 293 

while cooking); then cut the lemon into very thin slices with a sharp knife, and 
take out the seeds; two cupfuls of sugar, three tablespoonfuls of water, and two 
of sifted flour. Put into the pie a layer of lemon, then one of sugar, then one 
of the grated rind, and, lastly, of flour, and so on till the ingredients are used; 
sprinkle the water over all, and cover with upper OFUst. Be sure to have the 
under crust lap over the upper, and pinch it well, as the syrup will cook aU out 
if care is not taken when finishing the edge of crust. This quantity makes one 
medium-sized pie. 

ORANGE PIE. 

Grate the rind of one and use the juice of two large oranges. Stir together a 
large cupful of sugar and a heaping tablespoonful of flour; add to this the weU- 
beaten yolks of three eggs, two tablespoonfuls of melted butter. Eeserve the 
whites for frosting. Turn this into a pie-pan lined with pie-paste, and bake in a 
quick oven. When done so as to resemble a finely baked custard, spread on the 
top of it the beaten whites, which must be sweetened with two tablespoonfuls 
of sugar; spread evenly, and return to the oven and brown slightly. 

The addition of the juice of half a lemon improves it, if convenient to have it. 

BAKERS' CUSTARD PIE. 

Beat up the yolks of three eggs to a cream. Stir thoroughly a tablespoonful 
of sifted flour into three tablespoonfuls of sugar; this separates the particles of 
flour so that there will be no lumps; then add it to .the beaten yolks, put in a 
pinch of salt, a teaspoonful of vaniUa, and a little grated nutmeg; next the 
well-beaten whites of the eggs; and lastly, a pint of scalded mUk (not boiled) 
which has been cooled; mix this in by degrees, and turn all into a deep pie-pa;n, 
Uned with puff -paste, and bake from twenty-flve to thirty minutes. 

I received this recipe from a celebrated cook in one of our best New York 
bakeries. I inquired of him " why it was that their custard pies had that look 
of solidity and smoothness that our home-made pies have not." He repUed, 
" The secret is the addition of this hit of flour — not that it thickens the custard 
any to speak of, but prevents the custard from breaking or wheying, and gives 
that smooth appearance when cut." 

Il" CREAM PIE. 

Pour a pint of cream upon one and a half cupfuls of sugar; let it stand until 
the whites of three eggs haVe been beaten to a stiff froth; add this to the cream, 
and beat up thoroughly; grate a little nutmeg over the mixture, and bake with- 
out an upper crust. If a tablespoonful of sifted flour is added to it, as the above 
Custard Pie recipe, it would improve it. 



294 PASTRY, PIES AND TARTS. 

WHIPPED CREAM PIE. 
Line a pie-plate with a rich crust, and bake quickly in a hot oven. When 
done, spread with a thin layer of jeUy or jam, then whip one cupful of thick 
sweet cream until it is as light as possible; sweeten with powdered sugar and 
flavor with vanilla; spread over the jeUy or jam; set the cream where it wiU get 
very cold before whipping. 

CUSTARD PIE. 

Beat together until very hght the yolks of four eggs and four tablespoonf uls 
of sugar, flavor with nutmeg or vanilla; then add the four beaten whites, a pinch 
of salt and, lastly, a quart of sweet nulk; mix well and pour into tins lined with 
paste. Bake until firm. 

BOSTON CREAM PIE. 

Cream part. — Put on a pint of milk to boil. Break two eggs into a dish, and 
add one cup of sugar and haK a cup of flour previously mixed; after beating 
well, stir it into the milk just as the milk commences to boil; add an ounce of 
butter and keep on stirring one way until it thickens; flavor with vanilla or 
lemon. 

Crust part. — Three eggs, beaten separately, one cup of granulated sugar, one 
and a half cups of sifted flour, one large teaspoonful of baking-powder, and two 
tablespooniuls of milk or water. Divide the batter in half and bake on two 
medium-sized pie-tins. Bake in a rather quick oven to a straw color. When 
done and cool, spht each one in half with a sharp broad-bladed knife, and spread 
half the cream between each. Serve cold. 

The cake part should be flavored the same as the custard. 

MOCK CREAM PIE. 
Take three eggs, one pint of milk, a cupful of sugar, two tablespoonfuls of 
corn-starch, or three of flour; beat the sugar, corn-starch, and yolks of the eggs 
together; after the milk has come to a boil, stir in the mixture, and add a pinch 
of salt and about a teaspoonful of butter. Make crust the same as any pie; 
bake, then fill with the custard, grate over a little nutmeg and bake again. 
Take the whites of the eggs and beat to a stifl froth with two tablespoonfuls of 
sugar, spread over the top and brown in a quick oven. 

FRUIT CUSTARD PIE. 

Any fruit custard, such as pineapple, banana, can be readfly made after the 
recipe of "Apple Custard Pie."

CHERRY PIE. 

Line your pie-plate with good crust, fill half full with ripe cherries; sprinkle 
over them about a cupful of sugar, a teaspoonful of sifted flour, dot a few bits 
of butter over that. Now fill the crust full to the top. Cover with the upper 
crust, and bake. 

This is one of the best of pies, if made correctly, and the cherries in any case 
should be stoned. 

CURRANT PIE. No. i. 

Make in just the same way as the Cherry Pie, unless they are somewhat 
green, then they should be stewed a httle 

RIPE CURRANT PIE. No. 2. 
One cupful of mashed ripe cmrants, one of sugar, two tablespoonfuls of 
water, one of flour, beaten with the yolks of two eggs. Bake; frost the top 
with the beaten whites of the eggs and two tablespoonfuls powdered sugar, and 
brown in oven. 

GREEN TOMATO PIE. 
Take medium-sized tomatoes, pare, and cut out the stem end. Having your 
pie-pan Uned with paste made as biscuit dough, sUce the tomatoes very thin, 
filling the pan somewhat heaping, then grate over it a nutmeg, put ia half a cup 
of butter, and a medium cup of sugar, if the pan is rather deep. Sprinkle a 
smaU handful of flour over all, poiu-ing iti half a cup of vinegar before adding 
the top crust. Bake half an hour, iu a moderately hot oven, serving hot. Is 
good; try it. 

APRICOT MERINGUE PIE. 

A canned apricot meringue pie is made by cutting the apricots fine and mix- 
ing them with a half cup of sugar and the beaten yolk of an egg; fiU the crust 
and bake. Take from the oven, let it stand for two or three minutes, cover 
with a meringue made of the beaten white of an egg and one tablespoonful of 
sugar. Set back in a slow oven until it turns a golden brown. The above pie 
can be made into a tart without the addition of the meringue by adding criss- 
cross strips of pastry when the pie is first put into the oven. 

AU of the above are good if made from the dried and stewed apricots instead 
of the canned, and are much cheaper. 

Stewed dried apricots are a deUcious addition to mince-meat. They may be^ 
use in connection with minced apples, or to the exclusion of the latter.

HUCKLEBERRY PIE. 
Put a quart of picked huckleberries into a basin of water; take off whateifer 
floats; take up the' berries by the handful, pick out all the stems and unripe 
berries, and put them into a dish; line a buttered pie-dish with a pie-paste, put in 
the berries half an inch deep, and to a quart of berries, put half of a teacupful of 
brown sugar; dredge a teaspoonful of flour over, strew a saltspoonful of salt, and 
a little nutmeg grated over; cover the pie, cut a sUt in the centre, or make several 
small incisions on either side of it; press the two crusts together around the edge, 
trim it off neatly with a sharp knife, and bake in a quick oven for thre-equarters 
of an hour. 

BLACKBERRY PIE. 
Pick the berries clean, rinse them in cold water, and finish as directed for 
huckleberries. 

MOLASSES PIE. 
Two teacupfuls of molasses, one of sugar, three eggs, one tablespoonful of 
melted butter, one lemon, nutmeg; beat and bake in pastry. 

LEMON RAISIN PIE. 

One cup of chopped raisins, seeded, the juice and grated rind of one lemon, 
one cupful of cold water, one tablespoonful of flour, one cupful of sugar, two 
tablespoonfuls of butter. Stir hghtly together and bake with upper and under 
crust. 

RHUBARB PIE. 

Cut the large stalks off where the leaves commence, strip off the outside 
skin, then cut the stalks in pieces half an inch long; hne a pie-dish with paste 
rolled rather thicker than a doUar piece, put a layer of the rhubarb nearly an inch 
deep; to a quart bowl of cut rhubarb put a large teacupful of sugar; strew it over 
with a saltspoonful of salt and a little nutmeg grated; shake over a little flour; 
cover with a rich pie-crust, cut a sht in the centre, trim off the edge with a sharp 
knife, and bake in a quick oven tmtil the pie loosens from the dish. Rhubarb 
pies made in this way are altogether superior to those made of the fruit stewed. 

RHUBARB PIE, COOKED. 

Skin the stalks, cut them into small pieces, wash, and put them in a stew-pan 
with no more water than what adheres to them; when cooked, mash them fine, 
and put in a small piece of butter; when cool, sweeten to taste; if hked add a 
.Uttle lemon-peel, cinnamon or nutmeg; hne your plate with thin crust, put in

served. 

PINEAPPLE PIE. 

A grated pineapple; its weight in sugar; half its weight in butter; one cupful 
of cream; five eggs; beat the butter to a creamy froth; add the sugar and yolks 
of the eggs; continue beating till very hght; add the cream, the pineapple grated, 
and the whites of the eggs beaten to a stiiff froth. Bake with an under crust. 
Eat cold. 

GRAPE PIE. 

Pop the pulps out of the skins into one dish, and put the skins into another. 
Then simmer the pulp a httle over the fire to soften it; remove it and rub it 
through a colander to separate it from the seeds. Then put the skins and pulp 
together, and they are ready for pies or for canning or putting in jugs for 
further use. Fine for pies. 

DAMSON OR PLUM PIE. 
Stew the damsons whole in water only sufficient to prevent their burning; 
when tender, and while hot, sweeten them with sugar, and let them stand until 
they become cold; then pour them into pie-dishes hned with paste, dredge flour 
upon them, cover them with the same paste, wet and pinch together the edges 
of the paste, cut a sht in the centre of the cover through which the vapor may 
escape, and bake twenty minutes. 

PEACH PIE. 
Peel, stone, and sUce the peaches. Line a pie-plate with crust, and lay in 
your fruit, sprinkling sugar hberaUy over them in proportion to their sweetness. 
Allow three peach kernels, chopped fine, to each pie; pom* in a very httle water, 
and bake with an upper crust, or with cross-bars of paste across the top. 

DRIED FRUIT PIES. 

Wash the fruit thoroughly, soak over night in water enough to cover. In 
the morning, stew slowly, until nearly done, in the same water. Sweeten to 
taste. The crust, both upper and under, should be rolled thin; a thick crust to 
a fruit pie is undesirable. 

RIPE BERRY PIES. 
All made the same as Cherry Pie. Line your pie-tin with crust, fill half 
fuU of berries, shake over a tablespoonful of sifted flour, (if v^ery juicy), and as 



298 PASTRY, PIES AND TARTS. 

much sugar as is necessary to sweeten sufficiently. Now fill up the crust to the 
top, making quite fuU. Cover with crust, and bake about forty minutes. 

Huckleberry and blackberry pies are improved by putting into them a little 
ginger and cinnamon. 

JELLY AND PRESERVED FRUIT PIES. 

Preserved fruit requires no baking; hence, always bake the shell, and put in 
the sweetmeats afterwards; you can cover with whipped cream, or bake a top 
crust sheU; the former is preferable for dehcacy. 

CRANBERRY PIE. 

Take fine, sound, ripe cranberries, and with a sharp knife spht each one 

until you have a heaping coffee -cupful; put them in a vegetable dish or basin; 

put over them one cup of white sugar, half a cup of water, a tablespoon full of 

sifted flour; stir it all together and put into your crust. Cover with an upper 

crust and bake slowly in a moderate oven. You will find this the true way of 

making a cranberry pie. 

— Newport style. 

CRANBERRY TART PIE. 

After having washed and picked over the berries, stew them weU in a httle 
water, just enough to cover them; when they burst open, and become soft, 
sweeten them with plenty of sugar, mash them smooth (some prefer them not 
mashed); fine your pie-plates with thin puff paste, fill them, and lay strips of 
paste across the top. Bake in a moderate oven. Or you may rub them through 
a colander to free them from the skins. 

GOOSEBERRY PIE. 

Can be made the same as Cranberry Tart Pie, or an upper crust can be 
put on before baking. Serve with boiled custard, or a pitcher of good, sweet 
cream. 

STEWED PUMPKIN OR SQUASH FOR PIES. 

Deep-colored pumpkins are generally the best. Cut a pumpkiu or squash in 
half, take out the seeds, then cut it up in thick shces, pare the outside and cut 
again in smaU pieces. Put it into a large pot or sauce -pan, with a very little 
water; let it cook slowly until tender. Now set the pot on the back of the stove, 
where it wiU not burn, and cook slowly, stirring often until the moisture ia 
dried out and the pumpkin looks dark and red. It requires cooking a long time, 
at least half a day, to have it dry and rich. When cool, press through a colander. 



PASTRY, PIES AND TARTS. 299 

BAKED PUMPKIN OR SQUASH FOR PIES. 

Cut up in several pieces, do not pare it; place them on baking- tins and set 
them in the oven; bake slowly until soft, then take them out, scrape all the 
pumpkin from the shell, rub it through a colander. It will be fine and light 
and free from lumps. 

PUMPKIN PIE. No. I. 

For three pies: One quart of milk, three cupfuls of boUed and strained 
pumpkin, one and one-half cupfuls of sugar, one-half cupful of molasses, the 
yolks and whites of four eggs beaten separately, a little salt, one tablespoonful 
.each of ginger and cinnamon. Beat aJl together and bake with an under crust. 

Boston marrow or Hubbard squash may be substituted for pumpkin, and are 
much preferred by many, as possessing a less strong flavor. 

PUMPKIN PIE. No. 2. 

One quart of stewed pumpkin, pressed through a sieve; nine eggs, whites 
and yolks beaten separately; two scant quarts of milk, one teaspoonful of mace, 
one teaspoonful of cimiamon, and the same of nutmeg; one and one-half cupfuls 
of white sugar, or very Ught brown. Beat all well together, and bake in crust 
without cover. 

A tablespoonful of brandy is a great improvement to pumpkin or squash pies, 

PUMPKIN PIE, WITHOUT EGGS. 

One quart of properly stewed pumpkin, pressed through a colander; to this 
add enough good, rich milk, sufficient to moisten it enough to fill two good-sized 
earthen pie-plates, a teaspoonful of salt, half a cupful of molasses, or brown 
sugar, a tablespoonful of ginger, one teaspoonful of cinnamon, or nutmeg. Bake 
in a moderately slow oven three-quarters of an hovir. 

SQUASH PIE. 

One pint of boUed dry squash, one cupful of brown sugar, three eggs, two 
tablespoonfuls of molasses, one tablespoonful of melted butter, one tablespoonful 
of ginger, one teaspoonful of cinnamon, a pinch of salt, and one pint of milk. 
This makes two pies, or one large deep one. 

SWEET POTATO PIE. 

One pound of steamed sweet potatoes finely mashed, two cups sugar, one cup 

<jream, one-half cup butter, three weU-beaten eggs, flavor with lemon or nutmeg 

and bake in pastry shell. Fine.

COOKED MEAT FOR MINCE PIES. 

In order to succeed in having good mince pie, it is quite essential to cook the 
meat properly, so as to retain its juices and strength of flavor. 

Select four pounds of lean beef, the neck piece is as good as any; wash it, 
and put it into a kettle with just water enough to cover it; take off the scum 
as it reaches the boiling point, add hot water from time to time, until it ia 
tender, then season with salt and pepper; take off the cover and let it boU until 
almost dry, or until the juice has boUed back into the meat. When it looks as 
though it was beginning to fry in its own juice, it is time to take up, and set 
aside to get cold, which should be done the day before needed. Next day, when 
making the mince-meat, the bones, gristle and stringy bits should be well picked 
out before chopping. 

MINCE PIES. No. I. 

The "Astor House," some years ago, -wbb famous for its " mince pies." The 
chief pastry cook at that time, by request, pubhshed the recipe. I find that 
those who partake of it never fail to speak in laudable terms of the superior 
excellence of this recipe, when strictly followed. 

Four pounds of lean boUed beef, chopped fine, twice as much of chopped green 
tart apples, one pound of chopped suet, three pounds of raisins, seeded, two 
pounds of cmrants picked over, washed and dried, half a pound of citron, cut 
up fine, one pound of brown sugar, one quart of cooking molasses, two quarts 
of sweet cider, one pint of boiled cider, one tablespoonful of salt, one tablespoon- 
ful of pepper, one tablespoonful of mace, one tablespoonful of allspice, and four 
tablespoonfuls of cinnamon, two grated nutmegs, one tablespoonful of cloves; 
mix thoroughly and warm it on the range, until heated through. Eemove from 
the fire and when nearly cool, stir in a pint of good brandy, and one pint of 
Madeira wine. Put into a crock, cover it tightly, and set it in a cold place 
where it wiU not freeze, but keep perfectly cold. WiU keep good all winter.

MOCK MINCE-MEAT, WITHOUT MEAT. 

One cupful of cold water, half a cupful of molasses, half a cupful of brown 
sugar, half a cupful of cider vinegar, two-thirds of a cupful of melted butter, 
one cupful of raisins, seeded and chopped, one egg beaten Ught, half a cupful of 
roUed cracker-crumbs, a tablespoonf ul of cinnamon, a teaspoonf ul each of cloves, 
allspice, nutmeg, salt, and black pepper. 

Put the sauce-pan on the fire with the water and raisins; let them cook a 
few minutes, then add the sugar and molasses, then the vinegar, then the other 
ingredients; lastly, add a wine-glassful of brandy. Very fine. 

FRUIT TURNOVER. (Suitable for Picnics.) 

Make a nice puflf paste; roU it out the usual thickness, as for pies; then cut 
it out into circular pieces about the size of a small tea saucer; pile the fruit on 
half of the paste, sprinkle over some sugar, wet the edges, and turn the paste 
over. Press the edges together, ornament them, and brush the turnovers over 
with the white of an egg; sprinkle over sifted sugar, and bake on tins, in a brisk 
oven, for about twenty minutes. Instead of putting the fruit in raw, it may be 
boiled down with a httle sugar first, and then enclosed in the crust; or jam of 
any kind may be substituted for fresh fruit. 

PLUM CUSTARD TARTLETS. 

One pint of greengage plums, after being rubbed through a sieve; one large 
cup of sugar, the yolks of two eggs well beaten. Whisk aU together until hght 
and foamy; then bake in small patty-pans shells of puff -paste, a light brown. 
Then fill with the plum paste, beat the two whites until stiff; add two table- 
spoonfuls of powdered sugar, spread over the plum paste and set the shells into 
a moderate oven for a few moments. 

These are much more easUy handled than pieces of pie or even pies whole, 
and can be packed nicely for carrying. 

LEMON TARTLETS. No. i. 

Put a quart of milk into a sauce-pan over the fire. When it comes to the 
boiUng point, put into it the following mixture: Into a bowl put a heaping table-

starch into the juice of half a lemon, and add to the mixture. Beat all well 
together, and bake in tart shells without cover. 

MERINGUE CUSTARD TARTLETS. 

Select deep iadividual pie-tius; fluted tartlet pans are suitable for custard 
tarts, but they shoiild be about six inches in diameter and from two to three 
inches deep. Butter the pan and Kne it with ordinary puff -paste, then fill it 
with a custard made as follows: Stir gradually into the beaten yolks of six eggs 
two tablespoonfuls of flour, a saltspoonful of salt and half a pint of cream. Stir 
untn free from lumps' and add two tablespoonfuls of sugar; put the sauce-pan on 
the range and stir imtil the custard coats the spoon. Do not let it boil or it wiQ 
curdle. Pour it in a bowl, add a few drops of vanilla flavoring and stir imtil the 
custard becomes cold; fill the hned mold with this and bake in a moderate 
oven. In the meantime, put the white of the eggs in a bright copper vessel and 
beat thoroughly, using a baker's wire egg-beater for this purpose. While beat- 
ing, sprinkle in lightly half a poimd of sugar and a dash of salt. "When the pasta 
is quite firm, spread a thin layer of it over the tart and decorate the top with 
the remainder by squeezing it through a paper funnel. Strew a httle powdered 
sugar over the top, return to the oven, and when a dehcate yellow tinge remove 
from the oven, and when cold, serve.

BERRY TARTS. 

line small pie-tins with pie-crust, and bake. Just before ready to use, fill 
the tarts with strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, or whatever berries are in 
season. Sprinkle over each tart a httle sugar; after adding berries add also to 
each tart a tablespoonful of sweet cream. They form a delicious addition to the 
breakfast table. 

CREAM STRAWBERRY TARTS. 

After picking over the berries carefully, arrange them in layers in a deep pie- 
tin Uned with puff -paste, sprinkling sugar thickly between each layer; fill the 
pie-tia pretty full, pouring in a quantity of the juice; cover with a thick crust, 
with a sht iu the top, and bake. When the pie is baked, pour iato the sht in the 
top of the pie the following cream mixture: Take a small cupful of the cream 
from the top of the morning's milk, heat it imtil it comes to a boil, then stir into 
it the whites of two eggs beaten hght, also a tablespoonful of white sugar and a 
teaspoonful of corn-starch wet iu cold milk. Boil all together a few moments 
until quite smooth; set it aside, and when cool, pom- it into the pie through the 
eUt in the crust. Serve it cold with powdered sugar sifted over it. 

Easpberry, blackberry, and whortleberry may be made the same. 

GREEN GOOSEBERRY TART. 

Top and tail the gooseberries. Put into a porcelain, kettle with enough water 

to prevent burning, and stew slowly until they break. Take them off, sweeten 

well, and set aside to cool. When cold pour into pastry shells, and bake with a 

top crust of puff -paste. Brush all over with beaten egg while hot, set back ia 

the oven to glaze for three minutes. Eat cold.

weU-beaten eggs, and lemon. Line the little pans with the richest of puff- 
paste, and fiU with the mixture; bake until firm in the centre, from ten to fifteen 
minutes. 

GERMAN FRUIT PIE. 

Sift together a heaping teaspoonful of baking-powder and a pint of fiour; add 
a piece of butter as large as a walnut, a pinch of salt, one beaten egg, and sweet 
milk enough to make a soft dough. EoU it out half an inch thick; butter a

CUSTARDS, CREAMS AND DESSERTS. 305 

teacupful (more or less according to the number of tarts you want) of perfectly 
sweet and fresh cream, skimmed free of milk; put this into a large bowl or other 
deep dish, and with your egg-beater whip it to a thick, stiff froth; add a heap- 
ing tablespoonful of fine, white sugar, with a teaspoonful (a small one) of lemon 
or vanilla. Fill the cold shells with this and set in a cool place tiU tea is ready. 

OPEN JAM TARTS. 
Time to bake until paste loosens from the dish. Line shallow tin dish with 
puff -paste, put in the jam. roll out some of the paste, wet it hghtly with the 
yolk of an egg beaten w'th a little milk, and a tablespoonful of powdered sugar.

thirds of a pint of water; stir in the grated cocoanut and boil fifteen minutes 
longer. While warm, stir in a quarter of a pound of butter; add the yolks of 
seven eggs well beaten. Bake in patty-pans with rich paste. If prepared cocoa- 
nut is used, take one and a half coffee-cupfuls. Fine. 



Custarbs, Creams anb Beesetts* 

The usual rule for custards is, eight eggs to a quart of milk; but a very good 
custard can be made of six, or even less, especially with the addition of a level 
tablespoonful of sifted flom-, thoroughly blended in the sugar first, before adding 
the other ingredients. They may be baked, boiled or steamed, either in cups or 
one large dish. It improves custards to first boil the milk and then cool it before 
being used; also a httle salt adds to the fiavor. A very small lump of buttel 
may also be added, if one wants something especially rich. 

To make custards look and taste better, duck's eggs should be used when 
obtainable; they add very much to the flavor and richness, and so many are not 
required as of ordinary eggs, four duck's eggs to the pint of mOk making a 
delicious custard. When desired extremely rich and good, cream should be sub- 
stituted for the mflk, and double the quantity of eggs used to those mentioned^ 
omitting the whites. 

When making boiled custard, set the dish containing the custard into another 



3o6 CUSTARDS, CREAMS AND DESSERTS. 

and larger dish, partly flUed with boihng water, placed over the fire. Let the 
cream or milk come almost to a boU before adding the eggs or thickening, then 
stir it briskly one way every moment untU smooth and well cooked; it must not 
boil or it will cm-die. 

To bake a custard, the flre should be moderate, and the dish well buttered. 

Everything in baked custard depends upon the regularly heated slow oven. 
If made with nicety, it is the most deUcate of aU sweets; if cooked till it wheys, 
it is hardly eatable. 

Frozen eggs can be made quite as good as frosh on^s if used as soon as thawed 
soft. Drop them into boUing water, letting them remaia untU the water is cold. 
They will be soft aU through and beat up equal to those that have not been 
touched with the frost. 

Eggs should always be thoroughly weU-beaten, separately, the yolks first, 
then the sugar added, beat again, then add the beaten whites with the flavoring, 
then the cooled scalded mUk. The hghter the eggs are beaten, the thicker and 
richer the custard. 

Eggs should always be broken into a cup, the whites and yolks separated, 
and they should always be strained. Breaking the eggs thus, the bad ones may 
be easily rejected without spoiling the others, and so cause no waste. 

A meringue, or frosting for the top, requires about a tablespoonful of fine 
sugar to the beaten white of one egg; to be placed on the top after the custard 
or pudding is baked; smoothed over with a broad-bladed knife dipped in cold 
water, and replaced in the oven to brown shghtly. 

SOFT CARAMEL CUSTARD. 
One quart of mOk, half a cupful of sugar, six eggs, half a teaspoonful of salt. 
Put the milk on to boil, reserving a cupful. Beat the eggs and add the cold mUk 
to them. Stir the sugar in a small frying-pan until it becomes Uqmd and just 
begins to smoke. Stir it into the boUing milk; then add the beaten eggs and 
cold milk, and stir constantly untU the mixture begios to thicken. Set away to 
cool. Serve in glasses. 

BAKED CUSTARD. 

Beat five fresh eggs, the whites and yolks separately, the yolks with half a 
cup of sugar, the whites to a stiff froth; then stir them gradually into a quart of 
sweet, rich milk, previously boiled and cooled; flavor with extract of lemon or 
vanilla, and haK a teaspoonf xil of salt. Eub butter over the bottom and sides 
of a baking-dish or tin basin; pour in the custard, grate a little nutmeg over. 



CUSTARDS, CREAMS AND DESSERTS. 307 

and bake in a quick oven. It is better to set the dish in a shallow pan of hot 
water, reaching nearly to the top, the water to be kept boiling untU the custard 
is baked; three-quarters of an hovu" is generally enough. Eun a teaspoon handle 
into the middle of it; if it comes out clean it is baked sufficiently. 

CUP CUSTARD. 

Six eggs, half a cupful of sugar, one quart of new nulk. Beat the eggs, and the 
sugar and milk, and any extract or flavoring you like. Fill your custard cups, 
sift a httle nutmeg or cinnamon over the tops, set them in a moderate oven in a 
shallow pan half filled with hot water. In about twenty minutes try them 
with the handle of a teaspoon to see if they are firm. Judgment and great care 
are needed to attain skill in baking custard; for if left in the oven a minute too 
long, or if the fire is too hot, the milk will certainly whey. 

Serve cold, with fresh fruit sugared and placed on top of each. Strawberries^ 
peaches or raspberries, as preferred. 

BOILED CUSTARD. 

Beat seven eggs very hght, omitting the whites of two; mix them gradually 
with a quart of milk and half a cupful of sugar; boil in a dish set into another 
of boiling water; add flavoring. As soon as it comes to the boiling point, remove 
it or it will be Uable to curdle and become lumpy. Whip the whites of the two- 
eggs that remain, adding two heaping tablespoonfuls of sugar. When the cus- 
tard is cold, heap this on top; if in cups put on a strawberry, or a bit of red jelly 
on each. Set in a cold place tiH wanted. 

— Common Sense in the Household. 

BOILED CUSTARD, OR MOCK CREAM.

the eggs, weU beaten, with fom* tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar; let it boil up 
once or twice, stirring it briskly, and it is done. Mavor witn lemon, or vaniUa,, 
or raspberry, or to suit your taste.

stir it all the time until it becomes custard; then pour it into a pudding-dish 
to get cold; whisk the whites until stiff and dry; have ready a pan of boiling 
water, on the top of which place the whites; cover and place them where the 
water will keep sufficiently hot to cause a steam to pass through and cook them; 
place in a dish (suitable for the table) a layer of custard and white alternately; 
on each layer of custard grate a little nutmeg with a teaspoonful of wine; reserve 
a layer of white for the cover, over which grate nutmeg; then send to table, and 
eat cold.

cupful of sugar with them, and set them away tiU cold. Beat six eggs very 
Ught, and stir them gradually into a quart of rich milk, alternately with the 
stewed apple. Put the mixture into cups, or into a deep dish, and bake it about 
twenty minutes. Send it to table cold, with nutmeg grated over the top.

of boiling water; the steam passing through it cooks it ;« when sufficiently cooked, 
take a tablespoon and drop spoonfuls of this over the top of the custard, far 
enough apart so that the " little white islands " wiU not touch each other. By 
dropping a teaspoonful of bright jeUy on the top or centre of each island, is pro-

one pint of cream and a half pint of milk); whip it to a froth, and when the 

bowl is full, skim the froth into the pan which is standing on the ice, and 

repeat this untU the cream is all froth; then with a spoon draw the froth to one 

side, and you will find that some of the cream has gone back to mUk; turn this 

into the bow] again, and whip as before; when the cream is aU whipped, stir into 

it two-thirds of a cup of powdered sugar, one teaspoonful of vanilla and half of 

a box of gelatine, which has been soaked in cold water enough to cover it for 

one hour, and then dissolved in boiling water enough to dissolve it (about half 

a cup) ; stir from the bottom of the pan untU it begins to grow stiff; fill the molds 

and set them on ice in the pan for one hour, or until they are sent to the table. 

When ready to dish them, loosen hghtly at the sides and turn out on a flat dish.

Use currant jelly if vaniUa is used in the custard, crab-apple for bitter almond, 
and strawberry for lemon. Cover and bake for five minutes, after which take 
off the fid and brown the meringue a very httle. Sift powdered sugar thickly 
over the top. To be eaten cold. 

WASHINGTON PIE. 

This recipe is the sarne as " Boston Cream Pie," (adding half an ounce of but- 
ter, ) which may be found under the head of ' ' Pastry, Pies and Tarts. ' ' In summer 
time, it is a good plan to bake the pie the day before wanted; then when cool, 
wrap around it a paper and place it in the ice-box so as to have it get very cold; 
then serve it with a dish of fresh strawberries, or raspberries. A delicious dessert. 

CREAM PIE. No. 2.

-stiff enough to put on without running off, and flavor with vanilla. If you beat 
it after it is stiff it will come to butter. Put between the cakes and on top. 

DESSERT PUFFS. 
Puffs for dessert are delicate and nice; take one pint of mUk and cream each, 
the white of four eggs beaten to a stiff froth, one heaping cupful of sifted floui-,

thin slices, or chop them; prepare cream by whipping, sweetening and adding 
flavor of vanilla, if desired; put layers of peaches between the sheets of cake; 
pour cream over each layer and over the top. To be eaten soon after it is 
prepared. 

FRUIT SHORT-CAKES. 

For the recipes of strawberry, peach and other fruit short-cakes, look under 
the head of "Biscuits, EoUs and Muffins." They aU make a very delicious 
dessert when served with a pitcher of fresh, sweet cream, when obtaiaable. 

SALTED OR ROASTED ALMONDS. 

Blanch half a pound of almonds. Put with them a tablespoonful of melted 
butter and one of salt. Stir them tiU weU mixed, then spread them over a 
baking-pan and bake fifteen minutes, or till crisp, stirring often. They must be 
bright yellow -brown when done. They are a fashionable appetizer, and should 
be placed in ornamental dishes at the beginning of dinner, and are used by some 
in place of ohves, which, however, shoiild also be on the table, or some fine 
pickles may take their place. 

ROAST CHESTNUTS. 

Peel the raw chestnuts and scald them to remove the inner skin; put them 
in a frying-pan with a httle butter and toss them about a few moments; add 
a sprinkle of salt and a suspicion of cayenne. Serve them after the cheese. 

Peanuts may be blanched and roasted the same. 

AFTER-DINNER CROUTONS. 

These crispy croutons answer as a substitute for hard- water crackers, and 
■are also relished by most people. 

Cut sandwich-bread into sUces one-quarter of an inch thick; cut each sUce

into four small triangles; dry them in the oven slowly until they assume a deli- 
cate brownish tiat, then serve, either hot or cold. A nice way to serve them is 
to spread a paste of part butter and part rich, creamy cheese, to which may be 
added a very little minced parsley. 

ORANGE FLOAT. 

To make orange float, take one quart of water, the juice and pulp of twc- 
lemons, one coffee-cupful of sugar. When boiling hot, add four tablespoonfu] 
of corn-starch. Let it boil fifteen minutes, stirring all the time. When cold. 
pour it over four or five oranges that have been sliced into a glass dish, and over 
^he top spread the beaten whites of three eggs, sweetened and flavored with 
raniUa. A nice dessert. 

LEMON TOAST. 

This dessert can be made very conveniently without much preparation. 

Take the yolks of six eggs, beat them weU, and add three cupfuls of sweet 
milk; take baker's bread, not too stale and cut into sUces; dip them into the 
milk and eggs, and lay the shces into a spider, with sufficient melted butter, hot, 
to fry a deUcate brown. Take the whites of the six eggs, and beat them to a 
froth, adding a large cupful of white sugar; add the juice of two lemons, heating 
well, and adding two cupfuls of boiling water. Serve over the toast as a sauce, 
and you wiU find it a very dehcious dish, 

SWEET OMELET. No. i. 
One tablespoonful of butter, two of sugar, one cupful of milk, fovir eggs. 
Let the milk come to a boil. Beat the flour and butter together ; add to them 
gradually the boiling milk, and cook eight minutes, stirring often; beat the su- 
gar and the yolks of the eggs together; add to the cooked mixture, and set away 
to cool. When cool, beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, and add to the

SALAD OF MIXED FRUITS. 
Put in the centre of a dish a pineapple properly pared, cored and sliced, yet 
retaining as near as practicable its original shape. Peel, quarter and remove the 
seeds from four sweet oranges; arrange them in a border around the pineapple. 
Select four fine bananas, peel and cut into slices lengthwise; arrange these 
zigzag-fence fashion around the border of the dish. In the V-shaped spaces 
around the dish put tiny mounds of grapes of mixed colors. When complete, 
the dish should look very appetizing. To half a pint of clear sugar syrup add 
half an ounce of good brandy, pour over the fruit and serve. 

ORANGE COCOANUT SALAD. 

Peel and slice a dozen oranges, grate a cocoanut, and sUce a pineapple. Put 
alternate layers of each until the dish is full. Then pour over them sweetened 
wine. Served with small cakes. 

When oranges are served whole, they should be peeled and prettily arranged 
in a fruit dish. A small knife is best for this purpose. Break the skin from 
the stem into six or eight even parts, peel each section down half way, and tuck 
the point in next to the orange. 

CRYSTALLIZED FRUIT. 

Pick out the finest of any kind of fruit, leave on their stalks, beat the whites 
of three eggs to a stiff froth, lay the fruit in the beaten egg with the stalks 
upward, drain them and beat the part that drips off again; select them out, one 
by one, and dip them into a cup of finely powdered sugar; cover a pan with a 
sheet of fine paper, place the fruit inside of it, and put it in an oven that is cool- 
ing; when the icing on the fruit becomes firm, pile them on a dish and set them 
in a cool place. For this purpose, oranges or lemons should be carefully pared, 
and all the white inner skin removed that is possible, to prevent bitterness; then 
out either in thin horizontal sUces if lemons, or in quarters if oranges. For 
oherries, strawberries, currants, etc., choose the largest and finest, leaving stems 
-out. Peaches should be pared and cut in halves, and sweet juicy pears may be 
treated in the same way, or look nicely when pared, leaving on the stems, and 
iced. Pineapples should be cut in thin shces, and these, again, divided into 
quarters. 

PEACHES AND CREAM. 

Pare and shce the peaches just before sending to table. Cover the glass dish 
■containing them to exclude the air as much as possible, as they soon change

color. Do not sugar them in the dish — they then become preserves, not fresh 
fruit. Pass the powdered sugar and cream with them. 

SNOW PYRAMID. 
Beat to a stiff foam the whites of half a dozen eggs, add a small teacupful of 
currant jelly, and whip aU together again. Fill half fuU of cream as many 
saucers as you have guests, dropping in the centre of each saucer a tablespoon- 
ful of the beaten eggs and jeUy in the shape of a pyramid. 

JELLY FRITTERS. 

Make a batter of three eggs, a pint of milk, and a pint bowl of wheat flour 
or more, beat it Ught; put a tablespoonful of lard or beef fat in a frying or 
omelet pan, add a saltspoonf ul of salt, making it boiling hot, put in the batter by 
the large spoonful, not too close; when one side is a delicate brown, turn the= 
other; when done, take them on to a dish with a d'oyley over it; put a dessert- 
spoonful of firm jeUy or jam on each, and serve. A very nice dessert. 

STEWED APPLES. No. i. 

Take a dozen green, tart apples, core and slice them, put into a sauce-pan 
with just enough water to cover them, cover the sauce-pan closely, and stew the 
apples untU they are tender and clear; then take them out, put them into a deep 
dish and cover them; add to the juice in the sauce-pan a cupful of loaf sugar for 
every twelve apples, and boil it half an hour, adding to the syrup a pinch of 
mace and a dozen whole cloves just ten minutes before taking from the fire; 
pour scalding hot over the apple, and set them in a cold place; eat ice cold with 
cream or boiled custard. 

STEWED APPLES. No. 2. 

Apples cooked in the following way look very pretty on a tea-table and are 
Appreciated by the palate. Select firm round greenings, pare neatly and cut in 
halves; place in a shallow stew-pan with sufficient boUing water to cover them 
and a cup of sugar to every six apples. Each half should cook on the bottom of 
the pan and be removed from the others so as not to injure its shape. Stew 
slowly until the pieces are very tender, remove to a glass dish carefully, boil the 
syrup a half hour longer, pour it over the apples and eat cold. A few pieces of 
lemon boiled in the syrup adds to the flavor. 

BAKED PEARS. 
Pare and core the pears, without dividing; place them in a pan, and flU up 
the orifice with brown sugar; add a Httle water, and let them bake until per- 
fectly tender. Nice with sweet cream or boiled custard. 



CUSTARDS, CREAMS AND DESSERTS. 329 

STEWED PEARS. 

Stewed pears with a thick syrup make a fine dessert dish accompanied with 
cake. 

Peel and cut them in halves, leaving the stems on, and scoop out the cores. 
Put them iuto a sauce-pan, placing them close together, with the stems upper- 
most. Pour over sufficient water, a cup of sugar, a few whole cloves, and some 
sticks of cinnamon, a tablespoonful of lemon juice. Cover the stew-pan closely, 
to stew gently till the fruit is done, which wiU depend on the quahty of the 
fruit. Then take out the fruit carefully, and arrange it on a dish for serving. 
BoU down the syrup until quite thick; strain it and allow it to cool enough to 
set it; then pom- it over the fruit. 

The juice could be colored by a few drops of hquid cochineal, or a few shoes 
of beets, while boiling. A teaspoonful of brandy adds much to the flavor. 
Serve with cream or boiled custard. 

BAKED QUINCES. 

Take ripe quinces, pare and quarter them, cut out the seeds; then stew them 
in clear water untD. a straw wiU pierce them; put into a baking dish with half a 
cupful of loaf sugar to every eight quinces; pour over them the hquor in which 
they were boiled, cover closely, and bake in the oven one hour; then take out 
the quinces and put them into a covered dish; return the syrup to the sauce-pan 
and boil twenty minutes; then pour over the quinces, and set them away to cool. 

GOOSEBERRY FOOL. 

Stew a quart of ripe gooseberries in just enough water to cover them, when 
soft, rub them through a colander to remove the skins and seeds; while hot stir 
into them a tablespoonful of melted butter, and a cupful of sugar. Beat the 
yolks of three eggs, and add that ; whip aU together until hght. FUl a large 
glass fruit dish, and spread on the top of the beaten whites mixed with three 
tablespoonfuls of sugar. Apples or any tart fruit is nice made in this manner. 

MERINGUES OR KISSES. 
A coffee-cupful of fine, white sugar, the whites of six eggs; whisk the whites 
of the eggs to a stiff froth, and with a wooden spoon stir in quickly the pounded 
sugar; and have some boards put in the oven thick enough to prevent the bottom 
of the meringues from acquiring too much color. Cut some strips of paper 
about two inches wide; place this paper on the board and drop a tablespoonful 
at a time of the mixture on the paper, taking care to let aU the meringues be the 



330 CUSTARDS, CREAMS AND DESSERTS. 

same size. In dropping it from the spoon, give the mixture the form of an 
egg, and keep the meringues about two inches apart from each other on the 
paper. Strew over them some sifted sugar, and bake in a moderate ovgn for 
half an hour. As soon as they begin to color, remove them from the oven; take 
each slip of paper by the two ends, and turn it gently on the table, and, with a 
small spoon take out the soft part of each meringue. Spread some clean paper 
on the board, turn the meringues upside down, and put them into the oven to 
harden, and brown on the other side. When required for table, fill them with 
whipped cream, flavored with hquor or vaniUa, and sweeten with pounded 
sugar. Join two of the meringues together, and pile them high in the dish. To 
vary their appearance, finely chopped almonds or currants may be strewn over 
them before the sugar is sprinkled over; and they may be garnished with any 
bright-colored preserve. Great expedition is necessary in making this sweet dish, 
as, if the meringues are not put into the oven as soon as the sugar and eggs are 
mixed, the former melts, and the mixture woiild run on the paper instead of 
keeping its egg-shape. The sweeter the meringues are made the crisper wiU 
they be; but if there is not sufficient sugar mixed with them, they will most 
likely be tough. They are sometimes colored with cochineal; and, if kept weU- 
covered in a dry place, will remain good for a month or six weeks. 

JELLY KISSES. 

Kisses, to be served for dessert at a large dinner, with other suitable confeC' 
tionary, may be varied in this way: Having made the kisses, heap them in the 
shape of half an egg, placed upon stiff letter-paper lining the bottom of a thick 
baking-pan; put them in a moderate oven until the outside is a little hardened; 
then take one off carefully, take out the soft inside with the handle of a spoon, 
and put it back with the mixture, to make more; then lay the shell down. Take 
another and prepare it hkewise; fill the shells with currant jelly or jam; join 
two together, cementing them with some of the mixture; so continue until you 
have enough. Make kisses, cocoanut drops, and such like, the day before they 
are wanted. 

This recipe will make a fair-sized cake-basket fuU. It adds much to their 
beauty when served up to tint half of them pale pink, then unite white and 
pink. Serve on a high glass dish. 

COCOANUT MACAROONS. 

Make a "kiss" mixture, add to it the white meat, grated, and finish as 
directed for " Kisses.'" 



CUSTARDS, CREAMS AND DESSERTS. 331 

ALMOND MACAROONS. 

Half a pound of sweet almonds, a coffee-cupful of white sugar, the whites of 
two eggs; blanch the almonds and pound them to a paste; add to them the sugar 
and the beaten whites of eggs; work the whole together with the back of a 
spoon, then roll the mixture in your hands in balls about the size of a nutmeg, 
dust sugar over the top, lay them on a sheet of paper at least an inch apart. 
Bake in a cool oven a light brown. 

CHOCOLATE MACAROONS. 

Put three ounces of plain chocolate in a pan and melt on a slow flre; then 
work it to a thick paste with one pound of powdered sugar and the whites of 
three eggs; roU the mixture down to the thickness of about one-quarter of an 
inch; cut it iu small, round pieces with a paste-cutter, either plain or scalloped; 
butter a pan slightly, and dust it with flour and sugar in equal quantities; place 
in it the pieces of paste or mixture, and bake in a hot but not too quick oven, 

LEMON JELLY. No. i. 

Wash and prepare four calf's feet, place them iu four quarts of water, and 
let them simmer gently five hours. At the expiration of this time take them 
out and pour the liquid iato a vessel to cool; there should be nearly a quart. 
When cold, remove every particle of fal., replace the jeUy into the preserving- 
kettle, and add one pound of loaf sugar, the rind and juice of two lemons; when 
the sugar has dissolved, beat two eggs with their shells in one giU of water, 
which pour into the kettle, and boil five minutes, or until perfectly clear; then 
add one gill of Madeira wine, and strain through a flannel bag into any form 
you like. 

LEMON JELLY. No. 2. 

To a package of gelatine add a pint of cold water, the juice of four lemons 
and the rind of one; let it stand one hour, then add one pint of boiling water, a 
pinch of cinnamon, three cups of sugar; let it all come to a boil; strain through 
a napkin into molds; set away to get cold. Nice poured over sliced bananas and 
oranges. 

WINE JELLY.

add to this three cupfuls of sugar, the juice of three lemons and the grated rind 
of one. Now pour over this a quart of boiling water, and stir until dissolved,, 
22 



332 CUSTARDS, CREAMS AND DESSERTS. 

then add a pint of sherry wine. Strain through a napkin, tiun into molds 
dipped in cold water, and placed in the ice-box for several hours. 

One good way to mold this jelly is to pour some of it into the mold, harden 
it a Uttle, put in a layer of strawberries or raspberries, or any fresh fruit in 
season, pour in jelly to set them; after they have set, another layer of jelly, then 
ajiother of berries, and so fill each mold, alternating with jeUy and berries. 

CIDER JELLY. 

This can be made the same, by substituting clear, sweet cider in place of the 
wine. 

ORANGE JELLY. 

Orange jelly is a great deUcacy, and not expensive. To make a large dish, 
get six oranges, two lemons, a two-ounce package of gelatine. Put the gelatine 
to soak in a pint of water, squeeze the orange-juice into a bowl, also the lemon 
juice, and grate one of the lemon skins in with it. Put about two cupfuls of 
sugar with the gelatine, then stir in the orange- juice, and pour over all three 
pints of boiling water, stirring constantly. When the gelatine is entirely dis- 
solved, strain through a napkin into molds or bowls wet with cold water, and 
set aside to harden. In three or four hours it will be ready for use, and will last 
several days. 

VARIEGATED JELLY. 

After dividing a box of Cox's gelatine into halves, put each half into a bowl 
•with half a cupful of cold water. Put three-quarters of an ounce or six sheets 
of pink gelatine into a third bowl containing three-fourths of a cupful of cold 
water. Cover the bowls to keep out the dust, and set them away for two hours. 
At the end of that time, add a pint of boiling water, a cupful of sugar, half a 
pint of wine, and the jmce of lemon to the pink gelatine, and, after stirring till 
the gelatine is dissolved, strain the liquid through a napkin. Treat one of the 
other portions of the gelatine in the same way. Beat together the yolks of four 
eggs and half a cupful of sugar, and, after adding this mixture to the third 
portion of gelatine, stir the new mixture into a pint and a third of boiling mUk, 
contained in a double boiler. Stir on the fire for three minutes, then strain 
through a fine sieve, and flavor with a teaspoonful of vanilla extract. Place in 
a deep pan two molds, each holding about three pints, and surrovmd them with 
ice and water. Pour into these molds, in equal parts, the wine jelly which 
was made with the clear gelatine, and set it away to harden. When it has 
become set, pom* in the pink gelatine, which should have been set away in a 



CUSTARDS, CREAMS AND DESSERTS. 333 

place not cold enough to make it harden. After it has been transferred and has 
become hard, pour into the molds the mixture of eggs, sugar and gelatine, 
which should be in a liquid state. Set the molds in an ice-chest for three or four 
hours. At serving time, dip them into tepid water to loosen the contents, and 
gently turn the jelly out upon flat dishes. 

The clear jelly may be made first and poured into molds, then the pink jelly, 
and finally the egg jelly. 

STRAWBERRY JELLY. 

Strawberries, pounded sugar; to every pint of juice allow half a package of 
Cox's gelatine. 

Pick the strawberries, put them into a pan, squeeze them well with a wooden 
spoon, add sufficient pounded sugar to sweeten them nicely, and let them remain 
for one hour, that the juice may be extracted; then add half a pint of water to 
every pint of juice. Strain the strawberry juice and water through a napkin; 
measure it, and to every pint allow half a package of Cox's gelatine, dissolved 
in a teacupful of water. Mix this with the juice; put the jeUy into a mold, and 
set the mold on ice. A little lemon juice added to the strawberry juice improves 
the flavor of the jeUy, if the fruit is very ripe; but it must be well strained 
before it is put with the other ingredients, or it will make the jelly muddy. 
Delicious and beautiful. 

RECIPE FOR CHEESE CUSTARD. 

For three persons, 2 ounces of grated parmesan cheese ; the whites of 
3 eggs, beaten to a stiff froth ; a little pepper and salt and cayenne ; a little 
milk or cream to mix; bake for a quarter of an hour. 



ICE-CREAM. 

One pint of milk, the yolks of two eggs, six ounces of sugar, and one table- 
spoonful of corn-starch. Scald, but do not boil. Then put the whites of the two 
eggs into a pint of cream; whip it. Mix the milk and cream, flavor and freeze. 
One teaspoonful of vanilla or lemon is generally sufficient. 

The quantity, of course, can be increased to any amount desired, so long as 
the relative proportions of the different ingredients are observed. 

PURE ICE-CREAM. 

Grenuine ice-cream is made of the pvire sweet cream in this proportion: Two 
quarts of cream, one pound of sugar; beat up, flavor, and freeze. 

For family use, select one of the new patent freezers, as being more rapid 
and less laborious for small quantities than the old style turned entirely by hand. 
All conditions being perfect, those with crank and revolving dashers effect freez- 
ing in eight to fifteen minutes. 

FRUIT ICE-CREAM. 

Ingredients. — To every pint of fruit- juice allow one pint of cream; sugar to 
taste. 

Let the fruit be well ripened; pick it off the stalks, and put it into a large 
earthen pan. Stir it about with a wooden spoon, breaking it until it is weU- 
mashed; then, with the back of the spoon, rub it through a hair-sieve. Sweeten 
it nicely with pounded sugar; whip the cream for a few minutes, add it to the 
fruit, and whisk the whole again for another five minutes. Put the mixture 
into the freezer and freeze. Easpberry, strawberry, currant, and all fruit ice- 
creams, are made in the same manner. A little pounded sugar sprinkled over 
the fruit before it is mashed assists to extract the juice. In winter, when fresh 
fruit is not obtainable, a little jam maybe substituted for it; it should be melted 



ICE-CREAM AND ICES. 335 

and worked through a sieve before being added to the whipped cream; and if 
the color should not be good, a little prepared cochineal may be put in to improve 
its appearance. 

In making berry flavoring for ice-cream, the nulk should never be heated; 
the juice of the berries added to cold cream, or fresh, rich milk, mixed with cold 
cream, the juice put in just before freezing, or when partly frozen. 

CHOCOLATE ICE-CREAM. No. I. (Very fine.) 
Add four ounces of grated chocolate to a cupful of sweet milk, then mix it 
thoroughly to a quart of thick, sweet cream; no flavoring is required but vanilla. 
Sweeten with a cupful of sugar; beat again and freeze. 

CHOCOLATE ICE-CREAM. No. 2. 

Beat two eggs very light, and cream them with two cupfuls of sugar. Scald 
a pint of milk and turn on by degrees, mixing well with the sugar and eggs. 
Stir in this half a cupful of grated chocolate; retvu-n to the fire, and heat imtil it 
ithickens, stirring briskly; take off, and set aside to cool. When thoroughly 
cold, freeze. 

COCOANUT ICE-CREAM. 
One quart of cream, one pint of milk, three eggs, one cupful and a half of 
sugar and one of prepared cocoanut, the rind and juice of a lemon. Beat 
together the eggs and grated lemon-rind, and put with the nulk in the double 
boiler. Stir until the mixture begins to thicken. Add the cocoanut and put 
away to cool. When cool, add the sugar, lemon- juice and cream. Frreze. 

CUSTARD ICE-CREAM. 
Sweeten one quart of cream or rich milk with half a poimd of sugar, and 
flavor to taste; put it over the fire in a farina-kettle; as soon as it begins to boil, 
stir into it a tablespoonful of corn-starch or rice flour which has been previoiisly 
mixed smooth with a little milk; after it has boiled a few minutes, take it off 
the fire and stir in very gradually six eggs which have been beaten until thick; 
when quite cold, freeze it as ice-cream, 

STRAWBERRY ICE-CREAM. 
Mix a cupful of sugar with a quart of ripe strawberries, let them stand half 
a day, then mash and strain them through a coarse towel, then add to the juice 
a full cupful of sugar, and when dissolved, beat in a quart of fresh, thick cream. 
Easpberries, pineapple and other fruits made the same. 



336 ice-cream and ices. 

FRUIT CREAM. 
Make a rich, boiled custard; flavor with wine and vanilla; pour into a freezer. 
When half frozen, add pounded abnonds, chopped citron and brandy, peaches 
or chopped raisins. Have the freezer half full of custard and fill up with the 
fruit. Mix well, and freeze again. Almost any kind of fruits that are pre- 
ferred may be substituted for the above. 

TUTTI FRUTTI ICE-CREAM. 
Take two quarts of the richest cream, and add to it one pound of pulverized 
sugar, and fovir whole eggs; mix well together; place on the fire, stirring con- 
stantly, and just bring to boiling point; now remove immediately and continue 
to stir until nearly cold; flavor with a tablespoonful of extract of vanilla; place 
in freezer and when half frozen, mix thoroughly into it one pound of preserved 
fruits, in equal parts of peaches, apricots, gages, cherries, pineapples, etc. ; all 
of these fruits are to be cut up into small pieces, and mixed well with the frozen 
cream. If you desire to mold this ice, sprinkle it with a httle carmine, dissolved 
in a teaspoonful of water, with two drops of spirits of ammonia; mix in this 
color, so that it will be streaky, or in veins hke marble. 

ICE-CREAM WITHOUT A FREEZER. 
Beat the yolks of eight eggs very light, and add thereto four cupfuls of sugar, 
and stir well. Add to this, httle by httie, one quart of rich milk that has been 
heated almost to boiling, beating all the while; then put in the whites of eight 
eggs beaten to a stiff froth. Then boU the mixture in a pail set inside another 
containing hot water. Boil about fifteen minutes, or until it is as thick as a 
boiled custard, stirring steadily meanwhile. Pour into a bowl to cool. When 
quite cold, beat into it three pints of rich sweet cream and five teaspoonf uls of 
vanilla, or such other flavoring as you prefer. Put it into a pail having a close- 
fitting cover, and pack in pounded ice and salt — rock salt, not the common kind, 
— about three-fourths ice and one-fourth salt. When packed, before putting 
the ice on top of the cover, beat the custard as you would batter, for five minutes 
steady; then put on the cover and put the ice and salt over it, and cover the 
whole with a thick mat, blanket or carpet, and let it stand for an hour. Then 
carefully uncover and scrape from the bottom and sides of the pail the thick 
coating of frozen custard, making every particle clear, and beat again very 
hard, until the custard is a smooth, half -congealed paste. Do this thoroughly. 
Put on the cover, ice, salt and blanket, and leave it for five or six hours, re- 

plenishiQg the ice and salt if necessary.

FROZEN PEACHES. 

One can or twelve large peaches, two coffee- cupfuls of 'Sugar, one pint of 
•water, and the whites of three eggs beaten to a stiff froth; break the peaches 
rather tine and stir all the ingredients together; freeze the whole into form. 

Frozen fruits of any kind can be made the same way; the fruit should be 
mashed to a smooth pulp, but not thinned too much. In freezing, care should 
be taken to prevent its getting lumpy. 

FROZEN FRUITS. 

The above recipe, increasing the quantity of peaches, raspberries or whatever 
fruit you may use, and adding a small amount of rich cream, make fine frozen 
fruits. In freezing, you must be especially careful to prevent its getting lumpy. 

LEMON ICE. 
The juice of six lemons and the grated rind of three, a large sweet orange, 
juice and rind; squeeze out aU the juice, and steep in it the rind of orange and 
lemons a couple of hours; then squeeze and strain through a towel, add a pint 
of water and two cupfuls of sugar. Stir until dissolved, turn into a freezer, 
then proceed as for ice-cream, letting it stand longer, two or three homB. 

When fruit jellies are used, gently heat the water sufficiently to melt them; 
then cool and freeze. Other flavors may be made in this manner, varying the 
flavoring to taste. 

PINEAPPLE SHERBET. 

Grate two pineapples and mix with two quarts of water, and a pint of sugar; 
add the juice of two lemons, and the beaten whites of four eggs. Place in a 
freezer and freeze. 

RASPBERRY SHERBET. 

Two quarts of raspberries, one cupful of sugar, one pint and a half of water, 
the juice of a large lemon, one tablespoonful of gelatiae. Mash the berries and 
sugar together and let them stand two hours. Soak the gelatine in cold water 
to cover. Add one pint of the water to the berries, and strain. Dissolve the 
gelatine in half a pint of boiling water, add this to the strained mixture and 
freeze. 

ORANGE-WATER ICE. 

Add a tablespoonful of gelatine to one gill of water; let it stand twenty minutes 
and add half a pint of boiling water; stir until dissolved and add four ounces of 



338 ICE-CREAM AND ICES. 

powdered sugar, the strained juice of six oranges, and cold water enough to 
make a full quart in all. Stir until the sugar is dissolved; pour into the freezing 
can and freeze (see " Lemon Ice. ") 

ALMOND ICE. 

Two pints of milk, eight ounces of cream, two ounces of orange-flower water, 
eight oimces of sweet almonds, four ounces of bitter almonds; pound aU in a 
marble mortar, pouring, in, from time to time, a few drops of water; when 
thoroughly pounded add the orange-flower water and half of the milk; pass 
this, tightly squeezed, through a cloth; boil the rest of the milk with the 
cream, and keep stirring it with a wooden spoon; as soon as it is thick 
enough, pour in the almond milk; give it one boiling, take it off and let it cool 
in a bowl or pitcher, before pouring it into the mold for freezing. 

CURRANT ICE. 

A refreshing ice is made of ciurants or raspberries, or equal portions of each. 
Squeeze enough fruit in a jeUy-bag to make a pint of juice; add a pint each of 
the water and sugar; pour the whole, boiling hot, on to three whites of eggs, 
beaten to a stiff froth, and whip the mixture thoroughly. When cool, freeze in 
the usual manner. Part red raspberry juice is a much finer flavor. 

Any juicy fruit may be prepared in this manner.

It depends as much upon the judgment of the cook as on the materials used 
to make a good pudding. Everything should be the best in the way of materials, 
and a proper attention to the rules, with some practice, will ensure success. 

Puddings are either boiled, baked, or steamed; if boiled, the materials should 
be well worked together, put into a thick cloth bag, previously dipped in hot 
water, wringing it sUghtly, and dredging the inside thickly with flour; tie it 
firmly, allowing room for it to swell; drop it into a kettle of boiling water, with 
a small plate or saucer in the bottom to keep it from sticking to the kettle. It 
should not cease boiling one moment from the time it is put in until taken out, 
and the pot must be tightly covered, and the cover not removed except when 
necessary to add water from the boiling tea-kettle when the water is getting 
low. When done, dip immediately in cold water and turn out. This should bn 
done just before placing on the table. 

Or, butter a tin pudding-mold or an earthen bowl; close it tight so that water 
cannot penetrate; drop it into boiling water and boil steadily the required time. 
If a bowl is used it should be well buttered, and not quite filled with the pud- 
ding, allowing room for it to swell; then a cloth wet in hot water, shghtlj 
wringing it, then floured on the inner side, and tied over the bowl, meeting 
under the bottom. 

To steam a pudding, put it into a tin pan or earthen dish; tie a cloth over the 
top, first dredging it in flour, and set it into a steamer. Cover the steamer 
closely; allow a httle longer time than you do for boihng. 

Molds or basins for baking, steaming or boiling should be well buttered before 
the mixture is put into them. AUow a httle longer time for steaming than for 
boiling. 

Dumplings boiled the same way, put into httle separate cloths. 

Batter puddings should be smoothly mixed and free from lumps. To ensure 



340 DUMPLINGS AND PUDDINGS. 

this, first mix the floxir with a very small proportion of milk, the yolks of the 
eggs and sugar thoroughly beaten together, and added to this; then add the 
remainder of the milk by degrees, then the seasoning, then the beaten whites of 
eggs last. Much success rn making this kind of pudding depends upon a strict 
observance of this rule; for, although the materials may be good, if the eggs 
are put iuto the milk before they are mixed with the flour, there wiU be a cus- 
tard at the top and a soft dough at the bottom of your dish. 

All sweet puddings require a little salt to prevent insipidity and to draw out 
the flavor of the several ingredients, but a grain too much will spoU any pudding. 

In puddings where wine, brandy, cider, lemon-juice or any acid is used, it 
should be stirred in last, and gradually, or it is apt to curdle the .milk or eggs. 

In making custard puddings (puddings made with eggs and milk'), the yolk 
of the eggs and sugar should be thoroughly beaten together before any of the 
milk or seasoning is added, and the beaten whites of egg last. 

In making puddings of bread, rice, sago, tapioca, etc., the eggs should be 
beaten very hght, and mixed with a portion of the milk, before adding them to 
the other ingredients. If the eggs are mixed with the milk, without having 
been thus beaten, the milk wiU be absorbed by the bread, rice, sago, tapioca, 
etc., without rendering them hght. 

The freshness of all pudding ingredients is of much importance, as one bad 
article will taint the whole mixture. 

When the freshness of eggs is doubtful, break each one separately in a cup, 
before mixing them all together. Should there be a bad one amongst them, it 
can be thrown away; whereas, if mixed with the good ones, the entire quantity 
would be spoiled. The yolks and whites beaten separately make the articles 
they are put into much Ughter. 

Eaisins and dried fruits for puddings should be carefully picked, and, in 
many cases, stoned. Currants should be well- washed, pressed in a cloth, and 
placed on a dish before the fire to get thoroughly dry; they should then be picked 
carefully over, and every piece of grit or stone removed from amongst them. 
To plump them, some cooks pour boiling water over them, and then dry them 
before the fire. 

Many baked-pudding recipes are quite as good boiled. As a safe rule, boil 
the pudding twice as long as you would require to bake it; and remember that a 
boiling pudding should never be touched after it is once put on the stove; a jar 
of the kettle destroys the hghtness of the pudding. If the water boils down and 
more must be added, it must be done so carefully that the mold will not hit the 
side of the kettle, and it must not be allowed to stop boiling for an instaitw 



DUMPLINGS AND PUDDINGS. 34 1 

Batter should never stick to the knife when it is sent to the table; it will do 
this both when a less than sufficient number of eggs is mixed with it and when 
it is not enough cooked; about four eggs to the half pound of flour wiU make it 
firm enough to cut smoothly. 

When baked or boUed puddings are sufficiently solid, turn them out of the 
dish they were baked in, bottom uppermost, and strew over them finely sifted 
sugar. 

When pastry or baked puddings are not done through, and yet the outside is 
sufficiently brown, cover them over with a piece of white paper imtil thoroughly 
cooked; this prevents them from getting burnt, 

TO CLEAN CURRANTS. 
Put them in a sieve or colander, and sprinkle them thickly with flour; rub 
Bhem weU imtil they are separated, and the flour, grit and fine stems have passed 
through the strainer. Place the strainer and currants in a pan of water and 
wash thoroughly; then lift the strainer and currants together, and change the 
water until it is clear. Dry the currants between clean towels. It hardens 
them to dry in an oven. 

TO CHOP SUET. 
Break or cut in small pieces, sprinkle with sifted flour, and chop in a cold 
place to keep it from becoming sticky and soft. 

TO STONE RAISINS. 

Put them in a dish and pour boiling water over them; cover and let them 
remain in it ten minutes; it wiU soften so that by rubbing each raisin between 
the thumb and finger, the seeds wiU come out clean; then they are ready for 
cutting or chopping if required. 

APPLE DUMPLINGS. 

Make a rich biscuit dough, the same as soda or baking-powder biscuit, only 
adding a little more shortening. Take a piece of dough out on the molding- 
board, roU out almost as thin as pie-crust; then cut into square pieces large 
enough to cover an apple. Put into the middle of each piece two apple halves 
that have been pared and cored; sprinkle on a spoonful of sugar and a pinch of 
groimd cinnamon, turn the ends of the dough over the apple, and lap them 
tight. Lay the dumplings in a dripping-pan well buttered, the smooth side 
upward. When the pans are fiUed, put a small piece of butter on the top of 
each, sprinkle over a large handful of sugar, turn in a cupful of boiling water,

two of cream. With floured hands shape the mixture into balls, and tie them 
in floured pudding-cloths. Steam or boil forty minutes, and send to table with 
a custard sauce made as follows: 

Mix together four ounces of sugar and two omices of butter (slightly 
warmed). Beat together the yolks of two eggs and a giU of cream; mix and 
pour the sauce in a double sauce-pan; set this in a pan of hot water, and whisk

When fresh fruits are in season, this pudding is exceedingly nice, with dam- 
sons, plums, red currants, gooseberries, or apples; when made with these, the 
pudding must be thickly sprinkled over with sifted sugar. 

Canned or fresh peaches may be used m. place of apples va. the same manner, 
moistening the tapioca with the juice of the canned peaches ia place of the cold 
milk. Very nice when quite cool to serve with sugar and cream.

game, made a httle thinner, with a few raisins added, and baked in a well-

stir it into the fruit; serve hot or cold; very palatable without sauce, but more 
BO with plain, rich cream or cream sauce, or with a rich brandy or wine. Othei 
fruits can be used in place of peaches. Currants are best made in this manner: 

Press the currants through a sieve to free it from pips; to each pint of the 
pulp put two ounces of crumbed bread and four ounces of sugar; bake with a 
rim of puff -paste; serve with cream. White currants may be used instead of red.

earthen dish, in a hot oven, two hours. Place it on the table browned and 
smoking hot, eat it with plenty of fresh butter. This can be used as a 
dessert, by serving a sweet sauce with it. If eaten plainly with butter, it 
answers as a side vegetable. 

GENEVA WAFERS. 
Two eggs, three ounces of butter, three ounces of flour, three ounces of 
pounded sugar. Well whisk the eggs, put them into a basin, and stir to them the 
butter, which should be beaten to a cream; add the flour and sifted sugar gradu-

choose, and serve hot.

wdth the browned sugar, and let it simmer for ten minutes; then add half a glass 
of brandy or a glass of wine. The wine or brandy may be omitted if preferred. 

A GOOD, PLAIN SAUCE. 
A good sauce to go with plain fruit puddings is made by mixing one cupful 
of brown sugar, one cupfvd of best molasses, half a cupful of butter, one large 
teaspoonful of flour; add the juice and grated rind of one lemon, half a nutmeg, 
grated, half a teaspoonful of cloves and cinnamon. When these are aU stirred 
together, add a teacupful of boiling water; stir it constantly, put into a sauce- 
pan and let it boil until clear; then strain. 



374 SAUCES FOR PUDDINGS. 

OLD-STYLE SAUCE. 

One pint of sour cream, the juice and finely grated rind of a large lemon; 
sugar to taste. Beat hard and long until the sauce is very hght. This is delic- 
ious with cold " Brown Betty " — a form of cold farina, corn-starch, blanc-mange, 
and the like. 

PLAIN COLD, HARD SAUCE. 

Stir together one cupful of white sugar, and half a cupful of butter, until it 
is creamy and hght; add flavoring to taste. This is very nice, flavored with the 
juice of raspberries or strawberries, or beat into it a cupful of ripe strawberries 
or raspberries and the white of an egg, beaten stiff. 

CUSTARD SAUCE. 

One cupful of sugar, two beaten eggs, one pint of milk, flavoring to taste, 
brandy or wine, if preferred. 

Heat the mflk to boihng, add by degrees the beaten eggs and sugar, put in 
the flavoring, and set within a pan of boihng water; stir imtil it begins to 
thicken; then take it off, and stir in the brandy or wine gradually; set, until 
wanted, within a pan of boihng water. 

MILK SAUCE. No. i. 
Dissolve a tablespoonful of flour in cold milk; see that it is free from Imnps. 
Whisk an ounce of butter and a cupful of sugar to a cream, and add to if a 
pinch of salt. Mix together half a pint of milk, one egg, and the flour; stir this 
into the butter, and add a dash of nutmeg, or any flavor; heat until near the 
boiling point, and serve. Very nice in place of cold cream. 

MILK OR CREAM SAUCE. 
Cream or rich mflk, simply sweetened with plenty of white sugar and flavored^ 
answers the purpose of some kinds of pudding, and can be made very quickly. 

FRUIT SAUCE. 
Two thirds of a cupful of sugar, a pint of raspberries or strawberries, a table- 
spoonful of melted butter and a cupful of hot water. BoU aU together slowly, 
removing the scum as fast as it rises; then strain through a sieve. This is 
very good served with dumphngs or apple puddings. 

JELLY SAUCE. 
Melt two tablespoonfuls of sugar and half a cupful of jelly over the fire in a 
cupful of boiling water, adding also two tablespoonfuls of butter; then stir into 



SAUCES FOR PUDDINGS. 375 

it & teaspoonful of corn-starch, dissolved in half a cupful of water or -wine; add 
it to the jelly, and let it come to a boil. Set it in a dish of hot water to keep it 
warm until time to serve; stir occasionally. Any fruit jeUy can be used. 

COMMON SWEET SAUCE. 

Into a pint of water stir a paste made of a tablespooonful of corn-starch or 
flour (rubbed smooth with a little cold water); add a cupful of sugar and a table- 
spoonful of vinegar. Cook well for three minutes. Take from the fire and add 
a piece of butter as large as a small egg; when cool, flavor with a tablespoonful 
of vanilla or lemon extract. 

SYRUP FOR FRUIT SAUCE. 

Att excellent syrup for fruit sauce is made of Morello cherries (red, sour 
cherries). For each pound of cherry juice, allow half a pound of sugar and six 
cherry kernels ; seed the cherries and let them stand in a bowl over night ; in 
the morning, press them through a fine cloth which has been dipped in boiUng 
water ; weigh the juice, add the sugar, boil fifteen minutes, removing aU the 
scum. Fill small bottles that are perfectly dry with the syrup; when it is cold, 
cork the bottles tightly, seal them and keep them in a cool place, standing 
upright. 

Most excellent to put into pudding sauces. 

ROSE BRANDY. (For Cakes and Puddings.) 

Gather the leaves of roses while the dew is on them, and as soon as they 
open, put them into a wide-mouthed bottle, and when the bottle is fuU, pour in 
the best of fourth proof French brandy. 

It wiU be fit for use in three or four weeks, and may be frequently replenished. 
It is sometimes considered preferable to wine as a flavoring to pastries and pud- 
ding sauces. 

LEMON BRANDY. (For Cakes and Puddings.) 

When you use lemons for punch or lemonade, do not throw away xne peeJs, 
but cut them in small pieces— the thin yeUow outside (the thick part is not good), 
and put them in a glass jar or bottle of brandy. You wiU find this brandy useful 
for many purposes. 

In the same way keep for use the kernels of peach and plum stones, pound- 
ing them slightly before you put them into the brandy. 



Fruit for preserving should be sound and free from all defects, using white 
sugar, and also that which is dry, which produces the nicest syrup; dark sugar 
can be used by being clarified, which is done by dissolving two pounds of sugar 
in a pint of water; add to it the white of an egg, and beat it well, put it into a 
preserving kettle on the fire, and stir with a wooden spoon. As soon as it begins 
to sweU and boil up, throw in a httle cold water; let it boil up again, take it off, 
and remove the scum; boil it again, throw in more cold water, and remove the- 
scum; repeat until it is clear and pours hke oil from the spoon. 

In the old way of preserving, we used pound for pound, when they were kept 
in stone jars or crocks; now, as most preserves are put up in sealed jars or cans, 
less sugar seems sufficient; three-quarters of a pound of sugar is generally all 
that is required for a pound of fniit. 

Fruit should be boiled in a porcelain-lined or granite-ware dish, if possible;, 
but other utensils, copper or metal, if made bright and clean, answer as weU. 

Any of the fruits that have been preserved in syrup may be converted into- 
dry preserves, by first draining them from the syrup, and then drying them in a 
stove or very moderate oven, adding to them a quantity of powdered loaf sugar, 
which wSl gradually penetrate the fruit, while the fiuid parts of the syrap gently 
evaporate. They should be dried in the stove or oven on a sieve, nud turned, 
every six or eight hours, fresh powdered sugar being sifted over them every time 
they are turned. Afterwards, they are to be kept in a dry situation, in drawers 
or boxes. Ciurants and cherries preserved whole in this manner, in bunches, 
are extremely elegant, and have a fine flavor. In this way it is, also, that- 
orange and lemon chips are preserved. 

Mold can be prevented from forming on fruit jellies by pouring a little melted 
paraffine over the top. When cool, it wiU harden to a solid cake, which can be-, 
easily removed when the jelly is used, and saved to use over again another fear. . 
It is perfectly harmless and tasteless. 



FUESEHVES, JELLIES, ETC. 377 

Large glass ttiinblers are the best for keeping jellies, much better than large 
vessels, for by being opened frequently they soon spoil ; a paper should be cut to 
fit, and placed over the jeUy; then put on the Ud or cover, with thick paper 
rubbed over on the inside with the white of an egg. 

There cannot be too much care taken in selecting fruit for jeUies, for if the 
fruit is over ripe, any amount of time in boiling wiU never make it jelly, — there 
is where so many fail in making good jeUy; and another important matter is 
overlooked — that of carefully skimming off the juice after it begins to boU and 
a scum rises from the bottom to the top; the juice should not be stirred, but the 
scum carefully taken off: if allowed to boil under, the jelly wiQ not be clear. 

When either preserves or canned fruits show any indications of fermenta- 
tion, they should be immediately rebelled with more sugar, to save them. It is 
much better to be generous with the sugar at first, than to have any losses after- 
wards. Keep aU preserves in a cool, dry closet. 

PRESERVED CHERRIES. 
Take large, ripe Morella cherries; weigh them, and to each pound allow a 
pound of loaf sugar. Stone the cherries, (opening them with a sharp quiU,) and 
save the juice that comes from them in the process. As you stone them, throw 
them into a large pan or tureen, and strew about half the sugar over them, and 
let them lie in it an hour or two after they are all stoned. Then put them into 
a preserving-kettle with the remainder of the sugar, and boil and skim them till 
the fruit is clear and the syrup thick. 

PRESERVED CRANBERRIES. 
The cranberries must be large and ripe. Wash them, and to six quarts of 
cranberries aJlow nine pounds of the best loaf sugar. Take three quarts of the 
cranberries, and put them into a stew-pan vsdth a pint and a half of water. 
Cover the pan, and boil or stew them till they are aU to pieces. Then squeeze 
the juice through a jelly bag. Put the sugar into a preserving kettle, poiu: the 
cranberry juice over it, and let it stand until it is aU melted, stirring it up fre- 
quently. Then place the kettle over the fire, and put in the remaining three 
quarts of whole cranberries. Let them boU tiU they are tender, clear, and of a 
bright color, skimming them frequently. When done, put them warm into jars 
with the syrup, which should be hke a thick jeUy. 

PRESERVED STRAWBERRIES. 
For every pound of fruit weigh a pound of refined sugar, put them with the 
sugar over the fire in a porcelain kettle, bring to a boil slowly about twenty 



37^ PRESERVES, JELLIES, ETC. 

minutes. Take them out carefully with a perforated skimmer, and fill your hot 
jars nearly fuU; boU the juice a few minutes longer, and fill up the jars; seal 
them hot. Keep in a cool, dry place. 

TO PRESERVE BERRIES WHOLE. (Excellent.) 
Buy the fruit when not too ripe, pick over immediately, wash if absolutely 
necessary, and put in glass jars, filling each one about two-thirds fuU. 

Put in the preserving kettle a pound of sugar and one cupful of water for 
every two pounds of fruit, and let it come slowly to a boil. Pour this syrup into 
the jars over the berries, filUng them up to the brim; then set the jars in a pot 
of cold water on the stove, and let the water boil and the fruit become scalding 
hot. Now take them out and seal perfectly tight. If this process is followed 
thoroughly, the fruit will keep for several years. 

PRESERVED EGG PLUMS. 
Use a pound of sugar for a pound of plums; wash the plums, and wipe dry; 
put the sugar on a slow fire in the preserving-kettle, with as much water as 
Yidll melt the sugar, and let it simmer slowly; then prick each plum thoroughly 
with a needle, or a fork with fine prongs, and place a layer of them in the syrup; 
let them cook until they lose their color a Uttle and the skins begin to break: 
then lift them out with a perforated skimmer, and place them singly in a large 
dish to cool; then put another layer of plums in the syrup, and let them cook 
and cool in the same manner, until the whole are done; as they cool, carefully 
replace the broken skins so as not to spoil the appearance of the plums; when 
the last layer is finished, return the first to the kettle, and boil until transparent; 
do the same with each layer; while the latest cooked are cooling, place the first 
in glass jars; when all are done, pour the hot syrup over them; when they are 
cold, close as usual; the jelly should be of the color and consistency of rich wine 
JeUy. 

PRESERVED PEACHES. 

Peaches for preserving may be ripe but not soft; cut them in halves, take out 
the stones, and pare them neatly; take as many pounds of white sugar as of 
fruit, put to each pound of sugar a teacupful of water; stir it until it is dissolved; 
set it over a moderate fire; when it is boiling hot, put in the peaches; let them 
boil gently until a pure, clear, uniform color; turn those at the bottom to the top 
carefiilly with a skimmer several times; do not hurry them. When they are 
clear, take each half up with a spoon, and spread the halves on flat dishes to 
become cold. When all are done, let the syrup boil until it is quite thick; pour it 



PRESEHVES, JELLIES, ETC. 379 

into a large pitcher, and let it set to cool and settle. When the peaches are cold 
put them carefully into jars, and pour the syrup over them, leaving any sedi- 
ment which has settled at the bottom, or strain the syrup. Some of the kernels 
from the peach-stones may be put in with the peaches while boiling. Let them 
remaiu open one night, then cover. 

In Uke manner quince, plum, apricot, apple, cherry, greengage and othei 
fruit preserves are made; in every case fine large fruit should be taken, free 
from imperfections, and the sUghtest bruises or other fault should be removed. 

PRESERVED GREEN TOMATOES. 
Take one peck of green tomatoes. Shce six fresh lemons without removing 
the skins, but taking out the seeds; put to this quantity six pounds of sugar, 
common white, and boil until transparent and the syrup thick. Giuger root 
may be added, if hked. 

PRESF'^VED APPLES. (Whole.) 
Peel and core large firm apples (pippins are best). Throw them into water 
as you pare them. BoU the parings in water for fifteen minutes, allowing a 
piat to one pound of fruit. Then strain, and, adding three-quarters of a pound 
of sugar to each pint of water, as measured at first, with enough lemon-peel, 
orange-peel or mace, to impart a pleasant flavor, return to the kettle. When 
the syrup has been weU-skimmed and is clear, poiu" it boiling hot over the 
apples, which must be drained from the water in which they have hitherto 
stood. Let them remain in the syrup imtil both are perfectly cold. Then, 
covering closely, let them simmer over a slow fire imtil transparent. When aU 
the minutiae of these directions are attended to, the fruit wiU remain imbroken, 
and present a beautiful and inviting appearance. 

PRESERVED QUINCES. 

Pare, core and quarter your fruit, then weigh it and allow an equal quantity 
of white sugar. Take the paiings and cores, and put in a preserving-kettle; 
cover them with water and boil for half an hour; then strain through a hair 
sieve, and put the juice back into the kettle and boil the quinces in it a Uttle at a 
time until they are tender; hft out as they are done with a drainer and lay on 
a dish; if the hquid seems scarce add more water. When aU are cooked, throw 
into this Uquor the sugar, and allow it to boil ten minutes before putting in the 
quinces; let them boU until they change color, say one hour and a quarter, on a 
slow fire; while they are boiling occasionally slip a silver spoon under them to 
see that they do not bum, but on no account stir them. Have two fresh lemona 
25 



38o PRESERVES, JELLIES, ETC. 

cut in thin slices, and when the fruit is being put in jars lay a slice or two in each. 
Quinces may be steamed until tender. 

PRESERVED PEARS. 

One poimd of fruit, one pound of sugar; pare off the peeling thin. Make a 
nice syrup of nearly one cupful of water and one pound of sugar, and when 
clarified by boiling and skimming put ia the pears and stew gently imtil clear. 
Choose rather pears like the Seckle for preserving, both on account of the flavor 
and size. A nice way is to stick a clove in the blossom end of each pear, for 
this fruit seems to require some extraneous flavor to bring out its own piquancy. 
Another acceptable addition to pear preserves may be found instead, by adding 
the juice and thinly pared rind of one lemon to each flve pounds of fruit. If the 
pears are hard and tough, parboil them until tender before beginning to pre- 
serve, and from the same water take what you need for making their syrup. 

If you can procure only large pears to preserve, cut them into halves, or even 
slices, so that they can get done more quickly, and lose nothing in appearance, 
either. 

PINEAPPLE PRESERVES. 

Twist off the top and bottom, and pare off the rough outside of pineapples; 
then weigh them and cut them ia sUces, chips or quarters, or cut them in f oiu* 
or six, and shape each piece hke a whole pineapple; to each pound of fruit, put a 
teacupful of water; put it in a preserving kettle, cover it and set it over the 
fire, and let them boil gently until they are tender and clear; then take them 
from the water, by sticking a fork in the centre of each shce, or with a skimmer, 
into a dish. 

Put to the water white sugar, a pound for each pound of fruit; stir it vmtil it 
is all dissolved; then put in the pineapple, cover the kettle, and let them boil 
gently until transparent thoughout; when it is so, take it out, let it cool, and 
put it in glass jars; let the syrup boil or simmer gently until it is thick and rich, 
and when nearly cool, pour it over the fruit. The next day secure the jars, as 
before directed. 

Pineapple done in this way is a beautiful and deUcious preserve. The usual 
manner of preserving it, by putting it into the syrup without first bofling it, 
makes it Uttle better than sweetened leather. 

TO PRESERVE WATERMELON RIND AND CITRON. 
Pare off the green skin, cut the watermelon rind into pieces. Weigh the 
pieces, and allow to each pound a povmd and a half of loaf sugar. Line your 



PRESERVES, JELLIES, ETC. 3.8 1 

kettle with green vine-leaves, and put in the pieces without the sugar. A layer 
of vine-leaves must cover each layer of melon rind. Pour in water to cover the 
whole, and place a thick cloth over the kettle. Simmer the fruit for two hours, 
after scattering a few bits of alum amongst it. Spread the melon rind on a dish 
to cool. Melt the sugar, using a pint of water to a pound and a half of sugar, 
and mis with it some beaten white of egg. Boil and skim the sugar. When 
quite clear, put in the rind, and let it boil two hours; take out the rind, boil 
the syrup again, pour it over the rind, and let it remain all night. The next 
morning, boil the syrup with lemon-juice, allowing one lemon to a quart of 
syrup. When it is thick enough to hang in a drop from the point of a spoon, it 
is done. Put the rind in jars, and pour over it the syrup. It is not fit for use 
immediately. 

Citrons may be preserved in the same manner, first paring off the outer skin, 
and cutting them into quarters. Also green hmes. 

TO PRESERVE AND DRY GREENGAGES. 

To every pound of sugar allow one pound of fruit, one quarter pint of water. 

For this purpose, the fruit must be used before it is quite ripe, and part of 
the stalk must be left on. Weigh the fruit, rejecting aU that is in the least 
degree blemished, and put it into a Uned sauce-pan with the sugar and water, 
which should have been previously boiled together to a rich syrup. Boil the 
fruit in this for ten minutes, remove it from the fire, and drain the greengages. 
The next day boil up the syrup and put in the fruit again, let it simmer for 
three minutes, and drain the syrup away. Continue this process for five or 
six days, and the last time place the greengages, when drained, on a hair-sieve, 
and put them in an oven or warm spot to dry; keep them in a box, with paper 
between each layer, in a place free from damp. 

PRESERVED PUMPKINS. 

To each pound of pumpkin allow one pound of roughly pomided loaf sugar, 
one giU. of lemon- juice. 

Obtain a good, sweet pumpkin; halve it, take out the seeds, and pare off the 
rind; cut it into neat slices. Weigh the pumpkin, put the shces in a pan or deep 
dish in layers, with the sugar sprinkled between them; pour the lemon-juice 
over the top, and let the whole remain for two or three days. Boil aU together, 
adding half a pint of water to every three pounds of sugar used imtil the 
pumpkin becomes tender; then turn the whole into a pan, where let it remain 
for a week; then drain off the syrup, boil it imtU it is quite thick; skim, and 



382 PRESERVES, JELLIES, ETC. 

pour it boiling over the pumpkin. A little bruised ginger, and lemon-rind, 
thinly pared, may be boiled in tbe syrup to flavor the pumpkin.

PRESERVING FRUIT. (New Mode.) 

Housekeepers who dislike the tedious, old-time fashion of clarifying sugar 
and boihng the fruit, will appreciate the following two recipes^ no fire being 
needed in their preparation. The first is for " tutti f rutti, " and has been re- 
peatedly tested with unvarying success. 

Put one quart of white, preserving, fine Batavia brandy into a two-gallon 
stone jar that has a tightly fitting top. Then for every pound of fruit, in prime 
condition and perfectly dry, which you put in the brandy, use three-quarters of 
a pound of granulated sugar; stir every day so that the sugar will be dissolved, 
using a cleau, wooden spoon kept for the purpose. Every sort of fruit may be 
used, beginning with strawberries and ending with plums. Be sure and have at 
least one pound of black cherries, as they make the color of the preserve very 
rich. Strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, apricots, cherries (sweet and sour), 
peaches, plums, are all used, and, if you hke, currants and grapes. Plums and 
grapes should be peeled and seeded, apricots and peaches peeled and cut in 
quarters or eighths or dice; cherries also must be seeded: quinces maybe steamed 
until tender. The jar must be kept in a cool, dry place, and the daily stirring 
must never be forgotten, for that is the secret of success. You may use as much 
of one sort of fruit as you like, and it may be put in from day to day, just as 
you happen to have it. HaK the quantity of spirits may be used. The preserves 
will be ready for use within a week after the last fruit is put in, and will keep 
for a number of months. We have found it good eight months after making. 

The second is as follows: Take some pure white vinegar and mix vdth it 
granulated sugar until a syrup is formed quite free from acidity. Pour this 
syrup into earthen jars and put in it good, perfectly ripe fruit, gathered in dry 
weather. Cover the jars tight, and put them in a dry place. The contents will 
keep for six or eight months, and the flavor of the fruit wiU be excellent. 

TO PRESERVE FRUIT WITHOUT SUGAR. 

Cherries, strawberries, sliced pineapple, plums, apricots, gooseberries, etc., 
may be preserved in the following manner — to be used the same as fresh fruit. 

Gather the fruit before it is very ripe; put it in wide- mouthed bottles made 
for the purpose; fill them as full as they wiU hold, and cork them tight; seal the 
corks; put some hay in a large sauce-pan, set in the bottles, with hay between 
them to prevent their touching; then fill the sauce-pan with water to the necks 



FJiESERVES, JELLIES, ETC. 3^3 

Df the bottles, and set it over the fire until the water is nearly boihng, then take 
it off; let it stand untU the bottles are cold. Keep them in a cool place until 
iranted, when the fruit will be found equal to fresh. 

NEW METHOD OF PRESERVING FRUIT. 
A new method of preserving fruit is practiced in England. Pears, apples 
and other fruits are reduced to a paste by jamming, which is then pressed into 
cakes and gently dried. When required for use it is only necessary to pour four 
times their weight of boiling water over them, and allow them to soak for twenty 
minutes, and then add sugar to suit the taste. The fine flavor of the fruit is 
said to be retained to perfection. The cost of the prepared product is scarcely 
greater than that of the original fruit, differing with the supply and price of the 
latter; the keeping quaUties are excellent, so that it may be had at any time of 
the year, and bears long sea- voyages without detriment. No peeling or coring 
is require } . so there is no waste. 

FRUIT JELLIES. 

Take a stone jar and put in the fruit, place this in a kettle of tepid water, 
and set on the fire; let it boil closely covered, until the fruit is broken to pieces; 
strain, pressing the bag, a stout, coarse one, hard, putting in a few handfuls 
each time, and between each squeezing turning it inside out to scald off the pulp 
and skins; to each pint of juice allow a poimd of loaf sugar; set the juice on 
alone to boU, and while it is boOing, put the sugar into shallow dishes or pans, 
and heat it in the oven, watching and stirring the sugar to prevent burning; 
boU the juice just twenty minutes from the time it begins fairly to boil; by this 
time the sugar should be very hot; throw the sugar into the boiling juice, stir- 
ring rapidly aU the time; withdraw the spoon when all is thoroughly dissolved; 
let the jelly come to a boU to make all certain; withdraw the kettle instantly 
from the fire; roU your glasses and cups in hot water, and fill with the scalding 
liquid; the jeUy will form within an hour; when cold, close and tie up as you 
do preserves. 

CURRANT JELLY. 

Currants for jeUy shoiild be perfectly ripe and gathered the first week of 
the season ; they lose their jeUy property if they hang on the bushes too 
long, and become too juicy— the juice will not be apt to congeal. Strip them 
from the stalks, put them into a stone jar, and set it in a vessel of hot water 
over the fire; keep the water around it boiling untU the currants are aU broken, 
stirring them up occasionaUy. Then squeeze them through a coarse cloth or 
towel. To each pint of juice aUow a pound and a quarter of refined sugar. Put 



384 PRESERVES, JELLIES, ETC. 

the sugar into a porcelain kettle, pour the juice over it, stirring frequently. 
Skim it before it boils; boU about twenty minutes, or until it congeals in the 
spoon when held in the air. Pour it into hot jeUy glasses and seal when cool. 
Wild frost grape jeUy is nice made after this recipe. 

CURRANT JELLY. (New Method.) 

This recipe for making superior jelly without heat is given in a Parisian 
journal of chemistry, which may be worth trying by some of our readers. The 
currants are to be washed and squeezed in the usual way, and the juice placed 
in a stcaie or earthen vessel, and set away iu a cool place in the cellar. In about 
twenty-four hours a considerable amount of froth wiU cover the surface, pro- 
duced by fermentation, and this must be removed, and the whole strained again 
through the jeUy bag, then weighed, and an equal weight of powdered white 
sugar is to be added. This is to be stirred constantly imtil entirely dissolved, 
and then put into jars, tied up tightly, and set away. At the end of another 
twenty-four hours a perfectly transparent jelly of the most satisfactory flavor 
win be formed, which wiQ keep as long as if it had been cooked. 

QUINCE JELLY. 

Quinces for jeUy should not be quite ripe, they should be a fine yellow; rub 
off the down from them, core them, and cut them small; put them in a preserv- 
ing kettle with a teacupful of water for each pound; let them stew gently until 
soft, without mashing; put them in a thin muslin bag with the Uquor; press 
them very Ughtly; to each pint of the liquor put a pound of sugar; stir it until 
it is all dissolved, then set it over the fire, and let it boil gently, until by cooling 
some on a plate you find it a good jelly; then turn it into pots or tumblers, and 
when cold, secm"e as directed for jellies. 

RASPBERRY JELLY. 

To each pint of juice allow one pound of sugar. Let the raspberries be freshly 
gathered, quite ripe, picked from the stalks; put them into a large jar after 
breaking the fruit a little with a wooden spoon, and place this jar, covered, in a 
sauce-pan of boiling water. When the juice is well drawn, which will be in 
from three-quarters to one hour, strain the fruit through a fine hair sieve or 
cloth; measui-e the juice, and to every pint allow the above proportion of white 
sugar. Put the juice and sugar into a preserving-pan, place it over the fire, and 
boil gently until the jeUy thickens, when a httie is poured on a plate; carefuUy 
remove aU the scum as it rises, pour the jelly into small pots, cover down, and 
keep in a dry place. This jelly answers for making raspberry cream, and for 
flavoring various sweet dishes, when, in winter, the fresh fruit is not obtainable. 



PHESERVES, JELLIES, ETC. 385 

APPLE JELLY. 

Select apples that are rather tart and highly flavored; slice them without 
paring; place in a porcelain preserving-kettle, cover with water, and let them 
cook slowly until the apples look red. Pour into a colander, drain off the juice, 
and let this run through a jeUy-bag; return to the kettle, which must be care- 
fully washed, and boil half an hour; measure it and allow to every pint of juice 
a pound of sugar and half the juice of a lemon; boil quickly for ten minutes. 

The juice of apples, boiled in shallow vessels, without a particle of sugar, 
makes the most sparkUng, dehcious jeUy imaginable. Eed apples will give jelly 
the color and clearness of claret, while that from Ught fruit is Uke amber. Take 
the cider just as it is made, not allowing it to ferment at all, and, if possible, 
boil it in a pan, flat, very large, and shallow. 

GRAPE JELLY. 
Mash well the berries so as to remove the skins; pour aU into a preserving- 
kettle, and cook slowly for a few minutes to extract the juice; strain through 
a colander, and then through a flannel jeUy-bag, keeping as hot as possible, for 
if not allowed to cool before putting again on the stove the jeUy comes much 
stiff er; a few quince seeds boiled with the berries the first time tend to stiffen 
it; measure the juice, allowing a poimd of loaf sugar to every pint of juice, and 
boil fast for at least half an hour. Try a httle, and if it seems done, remove 
and put into glasses. 

FLORIDA ORANGE JELLY. 

Grate the yellow rind of two Morida oranges and two lemons, and squeeze 
the juice into a porcelain-Uned preserving-kettle, adding the juice of two more 
oranges, and removing all the seeds; put in the grated rind a quarter of a pound 
of sugar, or more if the fruit is sour, and a giU of water, and boil these ingre- 
dients together until a rich syrup is formed; meantime, dissolve two ounces of 
gelatine in a quart of warm water, stirring it over the fire until it is entirely dis- 
solved; then add the syrup, strain the jeUy, and cool it in molds wet in cold water. 

CRAB-APPLE JELLY. 

The apples should be juicy and ripe. The fruit is then quartered, the black 
spots in the cores removed, afterward put into a preserving-kettle over the fire, 
with a teacupful of water in the bottom to prevent burning; more water is added 
as it evaporates while cooking. When boiled to a pulp, strain the apples through 
a coarse flannel, then proceed as for currant jelly. 



386 PRESERVES, JELLIES, ETC. 

PEACH JELLY. 
Pare the peaches, take out the stones, then slice them; add to them about a 
quarter of the kernels. Place them in a kettle with enough water to cover 
them. Stir them often untU the fruit is weU cooked, then strain, and to every pint 
of the juice add the juice of a lemon; measure again, allowing a pound of sugar 
to each pint of juice; heat the sugar very hot, and add when the juice has boUed 
twenty nunutes; let it come to a boil, and take instantly from the fire. 

ORANGE SYRUP. 

Pare the oranges, squeeze and strata the juice from the pulp. To one pint of 
juice allow one pound and three-quarters of loaf sugar. Put the juice and sugar 
together, boil and skim it until it is cream; then sbrain it through a flannel bag, 
and let it stand until it becomes cool, then put in bottles and cork tight. 

Lemon syrup is made in the same way, except that you scald the lemons, 
and squeeze out the juice, allowing rather more sugar. 

ORANGE MARMALADE. 
Allow pound for pound. Pare half the oranges, and cut the rind iotio shreds. 
Boil iu three waters until tender, and set aside. Grrate the rind of the remaining 
oranges; take off, and throw away every bit of the thick white inner skin; 
quarter aU the oranges and take out the seeds. Chop, or cut them into small 
pieces; drain all the juice that will come away, without pressing them, over the 
sugar; heat this, stirring until the sugar is dissolvlH, adding a very little water, 
unless the oranges are very juicy. Boil and skim five or six minutes; put iu 
the boiled shreds, and cook ten minutes; then the chopped fruit and grated peel, 
and boil twenty minutes longer. When cold, put into small jars, tied up with 
bladder or paper next the fruit, cloths dipped in wax over aU. A nicer way stiQ 
is to put away in tumblers with self-adjusting metal tops. Press brandied tissue 
paper down closely to the fruit. 

LEMON MARMALADE 
Is made as you would prepare orange — allowing a pound and a quarter of 
sugar to a pound of the fruit, and using but half the grated peel. 

RAISINS. (A French Marmalade.) 
This recipe is particularly valuable at seasons when fruit is scarce. Take six 
fine large cooking apples, peel them, put them over a slo\s^fire, together with a 
wineglassful of Madeira wine, and half a pound of sugar. When well stewed, split 



PRESERVES, JELLIES, ETC. 387 

and stone two and a half pounds of raisins, and put them to stew with the 
apples, and enough water to prevent their burning. When all appears well 
dissolved, beat it through a strainer bowl, and lastly through a sieve. Mold, if 
5''ou like, or put away in small preserve jars, to cut in thin shoes for the orna- 
mentation of pastry, or to dish up for eating with cream. 

STRAWBERRY JAM. 

To each pound of fine, and not too ripe berries, allow three-quarters of a 
pomid of sugar. Put them into a preserving pan, and stir gently, not to break 
up the fruit; simmer for one-half hour, and put iuto pots air-tight. An excel- 
lent way to seal jelhes and jams is as the German women do: Cut round covers 
from writing paper a half -inch too large for the tops, smear the inside with the 
unbeaten white of an egg, tie over with a cord, and it wiU dry quickly and be 
absolutely preservative. A circular paper dipped in brandy, and laid over the 
toothsome contents before covering, wiU prevent any dampness from affecting 
the flavor. I have removed these covers heavy with mold, to find the preserve 
intact. 

GOOSEBERRY JAM. 

Pick tll^ gooseberries just as they begin to turn. Stem, wash and weigh. 
To four potmds of fruit add haK a teacupful of water; boil mitil soft and add 
four poimds of sugar and boil until clear. If picked at the right stage the jam 
will be amber-colored and firm, and very much nicer than if the fruit is pre- 
served when ripe. 

BRANDIED PEACHES OR PEARS. 

Four pounds of fruit, four pounds of sugar, one pint of best white brandy. 
Make a syrup of the sugar and enough water to dissolve it. Let this come to a 
boil; put the fruit in and boU five minutes. Having removed the fruit carefully, 
let the syrup boil fifteen minutes longer, or until it thickens well; add the brandy, 
and take the kettle at once from the fire; pour the hot syrup over the fruit, and 
seal. If, after the fruit is taken from the fire, a reddish Uquor oozes from it, 
drain this off before adding the clear syrtip. Put up in glass jars. Peaches and 
pears should be peeled for brandyiag. Plums should be pricked and watched 
carefully for fear of bursting. 

RASPBERRY JAM. 
To five or six pounds of fine red raspberries (not too ripe) add an equal quan- 
tity of the finest quality of white sugar. Mash the whole well in a preserving 
kettle; add about one quart of ciurant juice (a little less will do), and boU gently 



388 PRESERVES, JELLIES, ETC. 

iintil it jellies upon a cold plate; thea put into small jars; cover with brandied 
paper, and tie a thick white paper over them. Keep in a dark, dry and cool 
place. 

Blackberry or strawberry jam is made the same way, leaving out the curran 
juice. 

A NEW WAY OF KEEPING FRUIT. 
It is stated that experiments have been made in keeping fruit in jars covered 
only with cotton batting, and at the end of two years the fruit was sound. Tlw ! 
following directions are given for the process: Use crocks, stone butter- jars on 
any other convenient dishes. Prepare and cook the fruit precisely as for can- 
ning in glass jars; flU your dishes with fruit while hot; and immediately cover 
with cotton batting, securely tied on. Eemember that all putrefaction is caused 
by the invisible creatures in the air. Cooking the fruit expels all these, and they 
cannot pass through the cotton batting. The fruit thus protected will keep an 
indefinite period. It will be remembered that TyndaU has proved that the 
atmospheric germs cannot pass through a layer of cotton. 

MACEDOINES. 
Suspend in the centre of the jelly mold a bunch of grapes, cherries, sherries, or 
currants on their stems, sections of oranges, pineapples, or brandied fruits, and 
pom- in a Uttle jeUy when quite cold, but not set. It makes a very agreeable 
effect. By a httle ingenuity you can imbed first one fruit and then another, 
arranging in circles, and pour a httle jeUy successively over each. Do not re-heat 
the jelly, but keep it in a warm place, while the mold is on ic« and the first 
layers are hardening.

Berries and all ripe, mellow fruit require but little cooking, only long enough 
for the sugar to penetrate. Strew sugar over them, allow them to stand a few 
hours, then merely scald with the sugar; half to three-quarters of a poiind is 
considered sufficient. Harder fruits hke pears, quinces, etc., require longer 
boiling. 

The great secret of canning is to make the fruit or vegetable perfectly air- 
tight. It must be put up boihng hot, and the vessel filled to the brim. 

Have your jars conveniently placed near your boiling fruit, in a tin pan of 
hot water on the stove, roU them in the hot water, then fill immediately with 
the hot, scalding fruit, fill to the top, and seal quickly with the tops, which 
should also be heated; occasionally screw down the tops tighter, as the fruit 
shrinks as it cools, and the glass contracts, and allows the air to enter the cans. 
They must be perfectly air-tight. The jars to be kept in a dark, cool, dry place. 

Use glass jars for fruit always, and the fruit should be cooked in a porcelain 
or granite-iron kettle. If you are obKged to use common large-mouthed bottles 
with corks, steam the corks and pare them to a close fit, driving them in with a 
mallet. Use the following wax for seaUng: one pound of resin, three ounces of 
beeswax, one and one-half ounces of taUow. Use a brush in covering the corks, 
and as they cool, dip the mouth into the melted wax. Place in a basin of cool 
water. Pack in a cool, dark, and dry cellar. After one week, examine for 
flaws, cracks or signs of ferment. 

The rubber rings used to assist in keeping the air from the fruit cans some- 
times become so dry and brittle as to be almost useless. They can be restored to 
normal condition usually by letting them he in water in which you have put a 
Httle ammonia. Mix in this proportion: One part of ammonia and two parts 
water. Sometimes they do not need to he in this more than five minutes, but 
frequently a half-hour is needed to restore their elasticity.

CANNED PEACHES. 

To one pound of peaches allow half a pound of sugar; to six Dounds of sugar^ 
add half a tumbler of water; put in the kettle a layer of sugar and one of peaches- 
until the whole of both are in. Wash about eight peach-leaves, tie them up 
and put into the kettle, remembering to take them out when you begin to fill up 
the jars. Let the sugared fruit remain on the range, but away from the fire, 
imtil upon tipping the vessel to one side you can see sorne liquid; then fill th& 
jars, taking them out of hot water into which they were put when cold, remain- 
ing untn it was made to boil around them. In this way you will find out if the 
glass has been properly annealed; for we consider glass jars with stoppers screw- 
ing down upon India-rubber rings as the best for canning fruit in famiUes. 
They should be kept in a dark closet; and although somewhat more expensive 
than tin in the first instance, are much nicer, and keep for years with careful, 
usage. 

Fruit must be of fine flavor, and ripe,, though not soft, to make nice canned 
fruit. 

Peaches should be thrown into cold water as they are peeled, to prevent a 
yellowish crust. 

CANNED GRAPES. 

There is no fruit so difficult to can nicely as the grape; by observing the fol- 
lowing instructions you will find the grapes rich and tender a year from putting^ 
up. Squeeze the pulp from the skin, as the seeds are objectionable; boil the 
pulp until the seeds begin to loosen, in one kettle, having the skins boOing in a 
little water, hard, in another kettle, as they are tough. "When the pulp seems 
tender, put it through the sieve; then add the skins, if tender, with the water 
they boil in, if not too much. We use a large coffee-cupful of sugar for a quart 
can; boil imtil thick, and can in the usual way. 

CANNED STRAWBERRIES. 

After the berries are picked over, let as many as can be put carefully in the 
preserve kettle at once be placed on a platter. To each pound of fruit add 
three-fourths of a pound of sugar; let them stand two or three hours, tiU the 
juice is drawn from them; pour it into the kettle and let it come to a boil, and 
remove the scum which rises; then put in the berries very carefully. As soon 
as they come thoroughly to a boil put them in warm jars, and seal while boiling 
hot. 



CANNED. FRUITS. 39 1 

TO CAN QUINCES. 
Cut the quinces into thin sUces like apples for pies. To one quart jarful of 
quince, take a coffee-saucer and a half of sugar, and a coffee-cupful of water; 
put the sugar and water on the fire, and when boiling put in the quinces; have 
ready the jars with their fastenings, (Stand the jars in a pan of boiling water on 
the stove, and when the quince is clear and tender put rapidly into the jars, fruit 
and syrup together. The jars must be filled so that the syrup overflows, and 
fastened up tight as quickly as possible. 

CANNED PINEAPPLE. 
For six pounds of fruit, when cut and ready to can, make syrup with two 
and a half pounds of sugar and nearly three pints of water; boil syrup five 
minutes and skim or strain if necessary; then add the fruit, and let it boil up; 
have cans hot, fiU and shut up as soon as possible. Use the best white sugar. 
As the cans cool, keep tightening them up. Cut the fruit half an inch thick. 

CANNED FRUIT JUICES. 

Canned fruit juices are an excellent substitute for brandy or wine in aU pud- 
dings and sauces, etc. 

It is a good plan to can the pure juices of fruit in the summer time, putting it 
by for this purpose. 

Select clean ripe fruit, press out the juice and strain it through a flannel cloth. 
To each pint of juice add one cupful of white granulated sugar. Put it in a 
porcelain kettle, bring it to the bofling point, and bottle while hot in small 
bottles. It must be sealed very tight while it is hot. Will keep a long time, the 
same as canned fruit. 

CANNED TOMATOES. 
Canning tomatoes is quite a simple process. A large or small quantity may 
be done at a time, and they should be put in glass jars in preference to those of 
tin, which are apt to injure the flavor. Very ripe tomatoes are the best for the 
purpose. They are first put into a large pan and covered with boiling water. 
This loosens the skin, which is easily removed, and the tomatoes are then put 
into the preserving kettle, set over a moderate fire without the addition of water 
or any seasoning, and brought to a boil. After boihng slowly one-half hour, 
they are put into the jars while boiling hot and sealed tightly. They will keep 
two or three years in this way. The jars should be filled to the brim to prevent 
air from getting in, and set in a cool, dark closet. 



392 CANNED FRUITS. 

TO CAN CORN. 

Split the kernels lengthwise with a knife, then scrape with the hack of thft 
knife, thus leaving the hulls upon the cob. Fill cans fuU of cut com, pressing 
it in very hard. To press the com ia the can, use the small end of a potato 
masher, as this will enter the can easily, fit will take from ten to a dozen large 
ears of com to fill a one-quart can. When the cans are full, screw cover on with 
thumb and fu"st finger; this will be tight enough, then place a cloth iu the bottom 
of a wash boiler to prevent breakage. On this put a layer of cans in any posi- 
tion you prefer, over the cans put a layer of cloth, then a layer of cans. Fill the 
boiler in this manner, then cover the cans well with cold water, place the boiler 
on the fire, and hoil three hours without ceasing. On steady boiling, dependa 
much of your success. After boUiag three hours, lift the boUer from the fire, 
let the water cool, then take the cans from the boUer and tighten, let them 
remain until cold, then tighten again. Wrap each can in brown paper ta 
exclude the Hght, and keep in a cool dry cellar and be very sure the rubber rings 
are not hardened by use. The rings should be renewed every two years. I 
would advise the beginner to use new rings entirely, for poor rings cause the 
loss of canned fruit and vegetables in many cases. You wiU observe that in 
canning com the cans are not wrapped in a cloth nor heated; merely filled with 
the cut com. The corn in the cans will shrink considerably in boiling, but on 
no account open them after canning. 

TO CAN PEAS. 

Fill the can full of peas, shake the can so they can be filled well. Tou cannot, 
press the peas in the can as you did the com, but by shaking the cans they may- 
be flUed quite full. Pour into the cans enough cold water to fill to overflowing, 
then screw the cover tight as you can with your thumb and first finger and 
proceed exactly as in canning com. 

String beans are cut as for cooking and canned in the same manner. No- 
seasoning of salt, pepper or sugar shoiild be added. 

— Mary Currier Parsons. 
CANNED PLUMS. 

To every pound of plmns allow a quarter of a pound of sugar. Put the sugar 
and plums alternately into the preserving-kettle, first pricking the plums to pre- 
vent their breaking. Let them stand on the back of the stove for an hour or 
two, then put them over a moderate fire, and allow to come to a boil; skim and 
pour at once into jars, running a silver spoon handle aroimd the inside of the jar 
^ break the air-bubbles; cover and screw down the tops. 



CANNED FRUITS. 393 

CANNED MINCE-MEAT. 
Mince-meat for pies can be preserved for years if canned the same as frait 
while liot, and put into glass jars and sealed perfectly tight, and set in a cool, 
dark place. One glass quart jar will hold enough to make two ordinary -sized 
pies, and in this way " mince pies " can be had in the middle of summer as well 
as in winter, and if the cans are sealed properly, the meat wiU be just as fine 
when opened as when first canned. 

CANNED BOILED CIDER. 

BoUed cider, in our grandmothers' time, was indispensable to the making of 
a good "mince pie," adding the proper flavor and richness, which cannot be 
substituted by any other ingredient, and a gill of which being added to a rale of 
"fruit cake" makes it more moist, keeps longer, and is far superior to fruit 
cake made without it. Boiled cider is an article rarely found in the market, 
now-a-days, but can be made by any one, with but little trouble and expense, 
using sweet cider, shortly after it is made, and before fermentation takes place. 
Place five quarts of sweet cider in a porcelain-hned kettle over the fire, boil it 
slowly untU reduced to one quart, carefully watching it that it does not burn; 
turn into glass jars while hot, and seal tightly, the same as canned fruit. It is 
then ready to use any time of the year. 

CANNED PUMPKIN. 

Pumpkins or squash canned are far more convenient for ready use than 
those dried in the old-fashioned way. 

Cut up pumpkin or squash into small pieces, first cutting off the peel; stew 
them until tender, add no seasoning; then mash them very fine with a potato- 
masher. Have ready your cans, made hot, and then fill them with the hot 
pumpkin or squash, seal tight; place in a dark, cool closet. 

PEACH BUTTER. 

Pare ripe peaches and put them in a preserving-kettle, with sufficient water 
to boil them soft; then sift through a colander, removing the stones. To each 
quart of peach put one and one-half pound of sugar, and boil very slowly one 
hour. Stir often, and do not let them bum. Put in stone or glass jars, and 
keep in a cool place 



394 CANNED FRUITS. 

PEACHES DRIED WITH SUGAR. 
Peel yellow peaches, cut them from the stone in one piece; allow two pounds 
of sugar to six pounds of fruit; make a syrup of three-quarters of a pound of 
sugar, and a little water; put in the peaches, a few at a time, and let them cook 
gently until quite clear. Take them up carefully on a dish and set them in the 
sun to dry. Strew powdered sugar over them on aU sides, a httle at a time; if 
any syrup is left, remove to fresh dishes. When they are quite dry, lay them 
Ughtly in a jar with a httle sugar sifted between the layers. 




RED OR PINK COLORING. 

Take two cents' worth of cochineal. Lay it on a flat plate, and bruise it with 
the blade of a knife. Put it into half a teacupful of alcohol. Let it stand a 
quarter of an hour, and then filter it through fine mushn. Always ready for 
immediate use. Cork the bottle tight. 

Strawberry or cranberry juice makes a fine coloring for frosting sweet pud- 
dings and confectionery. 

DEEP RED COLORING. 

Take twenty grains of cochineal, and fifteen grains of cream of tartar finely 
powdered; add to them a piece of alum the size of a cherry stone, and boil them 
with a gOl of soft water, in an earthen vessel, slowly, for half an hour. Then 
strain it through muslin, and keep it tightly corked in a phial. If a little alcohol 
is added, it wiU keep any length of time. 

YELLOW COLORING. 

Take a little saffron, put it into an earthen vessel with a very small quantity 
of cold, soft water, and let it steep till the color of the infusion is a bright yellow. 
Then strain it, add half alcohol to it. To color fruit yellow, boil the fruit with 
fresh skin lemons in water to cover them untU it is tender; then take it up, 
spread it on dishes to cool, and finish as may be directed. 

To color icing, put the grated peel of a lemon or orange in a thin muslin bag, 
squeezing a httle juice through it, then mixing with the sugar. 

GREEN COLORING. 

Take fresh spinach or beet leaves, and pound them in a marble mortar. If 

you want it for immediate use, take off the green froth as it rises, and mix it 

witli the article you intend to color. If you wish to keep it a few days, take 
26 



39^ COLORING FOR FRUIT, ETC. 

the juice when you have pressed out a teacupful, and adding to it a piece of 
alum the size of a pea, give it a boU in a sauce-pan. Or make the juice very 
strong and add a quart of alcohol. Bottle it air-tight. 

SUGAR GRAINS. 

These are made by pounding white lump sugar in a mortar and shaking it 
through sieves of different degrees of coarseness, thus accumulating grains of 
different sizes. They are used in ornamenting cake. 

SUGAR GRAINS, COLORED. 

Stir a Uttle coloring — as the essence of spinach, or prepared cochineal, or Uquid 
carmine, or indigo, rouge, saffron, etc., — into the sugar grains made as above, vm- 
til each grain is stained, then spread them on a baking-sheet, and dry them in 
a warm place. They are used in ornamenting cake. 

CARAMEL OR BURNT SUGAR. 

Put one cupful of sugar and two teaspoonf uls of water in a sauce-pan on the 
fire; stir constantly until it is quite a dark color, then add a half cupful of 
water, and a pinch of salt; let it boil a few minutes, and when cold, bottle. 

For coloring soups, sauces or gravies. 

TO CLARIFY JELLY. 

The white of eggs is, perhaps, the best substance that can be employed in 
clarifying jelly, as well as some other fluids, for the reason that when albumen 
(and the white of eggs is nearly pure albumen) is put into a hquid that is muddy, 
from substances suspended in it, on boihng the Uquid the albumen coagulates in 
a flocculent manner, and, entangling with the impurities, rises with them to the 
surface as a sciun, or sinks to the bottoiu, according to their weight. 



In the making of confections, the best granulated or loaf sugar should be 
used. (Beware of glucose mixed with sugar.) Sugar is boiled more or less, 
according to the kin 1 of candy to be made, and it is necessary to understand the 
proper degree of sugar boiling to operate it successfully. 

Occasionally suga^ made into candies, " creams " or syrups, will need clarify- 
ing. The process is as follows: Beat up well the white of an egg with a cupful 
of cold water and pour it into a very clean iron or thick new tin sauce-pan, then 
put into the pan four cupfuls of sugar, mixed with a cupful of warm water„ 
Put on the stove, and heat moderately until the scum rises. Eemove the pan, 
and skim off the top, then place on the fire again until the scum rises again. 
Then remove as before, and so continue until no scum rises. 

This recipe is for good brown or yellowish sugar; for soft, white sugars, half 
the white of an egg will do, and for refined or loaf sugar a quarter will do. 

The quantities of sugar and water are the same in all cases. Loaf sugar will 
generally do for all candy-making without further clarification. Brown or 
yellow sugars are used for caramels, dark-colored cocoanut, taffy, and pulled 
molasses candies generally. 

Havana is the cheapest grade of white sugar and a shade or two hghter than 
the brown. 

Confectioners' A is superior in color and grain to the Havana. It is a cen- 
trifugal sugar— that is, it is not re-boiled to procure its white color, but is 
moistened with water and then put into rapidly revolving cylinders. The un- 
crystaUzed syrup or molasses is whirled out of it, and the sugar comes out with 
a dry, white grain. 

Icing or Powdered Sugars. This is powdered loaf sugnr. Icing can only be 
knade with powdered sugar, which is produced by grindin^^ or crushing loaf sugar 
as fine as flour nearly. 

Granulated Sugar This i? a coarse-grained sugar, generally very clean arrfS 



39^ CONFECTIONERY. 

sparkling, and fit for use as a colored sugar in crystaUzed goods, and other 
superior^ uses. 

This satee- syrup answers for most candies, and should be boiled to such a 
degree, that when a fork or sphnter is dipped into it the liquid will rvm oif and 
form a thick drop on the end, and long, silk-hke threads hang from them when 
exposed to the air. The syrup never to be stirred while hot, or else it will grain, 
but if intended for soft, French candies, should be removed, and, when nearly 
cold, stirred to a cream. For hard, brittle candies, the syrup should be boUed 
untU, when a httle is dropped in cold water, it will crack and break when biting it. 

The hands should be buttered when handling it, or it will stick to them. 

The top of the inside of the dish that the sugar or molasses is to be cooked in^ 
should be buttered a few inches aroimd the inside; it prevents the syrup from 
rising and swelling any higher than where it reaches the buttered edge. 

For common crack candies, the sugar can be kept from graining by adding 
a teaspoonful of vinegar or cream tartar. 

Colorings for candies should be harmless, and those used for fruit and con- 
fectionery, on page 395, will be most suitable. 

Essences and extracts should be bought at the druggist's, not the poor kind 
usually sold at the grocer's. 

FRENCH CREAM CANDY. 
Put four cupfuls of white sugar and one cupful of water into a bright tin 
pan on the range, and let it boil without stirring for ten minutes. If it looks 
somewhat thick, test it by letting some drop from the spoon, and if it threads, 
remove the pan to the table. Take out a small spoonful, and rub it against the 
side of a cake-bowl; if it becomes creamy, and will roll into a ball between the 
fingers, pour the whole into the bowl. When cool enough to bear your finger in 
it, take it in your lap, stir or beat it with a large spoon, or pudding-stick. It 
win soon begin to look hke cream, and then grow stiffer until you find it neces- 
sary to take your hands and work it hke bread dough. If it is not boiled enough 
to cream, set it back upon the range, and let it remain one or two minutes, or 
as long as is necessary, taking care not to cook it too much. Add the fiavoring 
as soon as it begins to cool. This is the foundation of all French creams. It 
can be made into roUs, and sliced off, or packed in plates and cut into small 
cubes, or made into any shape imitating French candies. A pretty form is 
made by coloring some of the cream pink, taking a piece about as large as ai< 
hazel nut, and crowding an almond meat half way into one side, tiU it looks 
like a bursting kernel. In working, should the cream get too cold, warm it. 



CONFECTIONERY. 399 

To be successful in maMng this cream, several points are to be remembered; 
"when the boiled sugar is cool enough to beat, if it looks rough and has turned to 
sugar it is because it has been boiled too much, or has been stirred. If, after it 
is beaten, it does not look Uke lard or thick cream, and is sandy or sugary 
instead, it is because you did not let it get cool enough before beating. 

It is not boiled enough if it does not harden so as to work like dough, and 
should not stick to the hands; in this case put it back into the pan with an 
ounce of hot water, and cook over just enough, by testing in water as above. 
After it is tiu-ned into the bowl to cool, it should look clear as jeUy. Practice 
and patience wiU make perfect. 

FRUIT CREAMS. 

Add to "French Cream," raisins, currants, figs, a httle citron, chopped and 
mixed thoroughly through the cream while quite warm. Make into bars or flat 
cakes. 

WALNUT CREAMS. 

Take a piece of "French Cream" the size of a walnut. Having cracked 
some Enghsh walnuts, using care not to break the meats, place one-half of each 
nut upon each side of the ball, pressing them into the baU. 

Walnut creams can be made by another method : First take a piece of ' ' French 
Cream," put it into a cup, and settiag the cup into a vessel of boiling water, 
heating it until it turns Uke thick cream; drop the walnut meats into it, one at 
a time, taking it out on the end of a fork, and placing it on buttered paper; con- 
tinue to dip them until all are used, then go over again, giving them a second 
coat of candy. They look nicely colored pink, and flavored with vanilla. 

CHOCOLATE CREAMS. 

Use "French Cream," and form it into small cone-shaped balls with the 
fingers. Lay them upon paper to harden until aU are formed. Melt one cake 
of bakers' chocolate in an earthen dish or small basin; by setting it in the oven 
it will soon melt; do not let it cook, but it must be kept Tfiot. 

Take the balls of cream, one at a time, on the tines of a fork, pour the melted 
chocolate over them with a teaspoon, and when well covered, shp them from the 
fork upon oiled paper. 

COCOANUT CREAMS. 

Take two tablespoonfuls of grated cocoanut and halt as much "French 
candy; " work them both together with your hand tiU the cocoanut is aU weU 
mixed in it. K you choose, you can add a drop of vanilla. If too soft to work 



400 CONFECTIONERY. 

toto balls, add confectioners' sugar to stiffen; make into balls the size of hazel- 
nuts, and dip twice, as ia the foregoing recipes, flavoring the melted " French 
Cream " with vanilla. 

VARIEGATED CREAMS. 

Mak'j the "French Cream" recipe, and divide into three parts, leaving one part 
white, color one pink with cochineal syrup, and the third part color brown with 
chocolate, which is done by just letting the cream soften and stirring in a little 
finely grated chocolate. The pink is colored by dropping on a few drops of 
cochineal syrup while the cream is warm, and beating it in. Take the white 
cream, make a flat ball of it, and lay it upon a buttered dish, and pat it out flat 
until about half an inch thick. If it does not work easily, dip the hand in alco- 
hol. Take the pink cream, work in the same way as the white and lay it upon 
the white; then the chocolate in the same manner, and lay upon the pink, press- 
ing all together. Trim the edges off smooth, leaving it in a nice, square cake, 
then cut into sUces or small cubes, as you prefer. It is necessary to work it all 
up as rapidly as possible. 

RASPBERRY CREAMS. 

Stir enough confectioners' sugar into a teaspoonful of raspberry jam to form 
A, thick paste; roU it into balls between the pahns of your hands. Put a lump of 
" French Cream " into a teacup, and set it into a basin of boiling water, stirring 
it until it has melted; then drop a few drops of cochineal coloring to make it a 
pale pink, or a few drops of raspberry juice, being careful not to add enough to 
prevent its hardening. Now dip these httle balls into the sugar cream, giving 
them two coats. Lay aside to harden. 

Remember to fceep stirring the melted cream, or if not it will turn hack to 
clear syrup. 

NUT CREAMS. 

Chop almonds, hickory nuts, butternuts or English walnuts quite fine. Make 
the " French Cream," and before adding aU the sugar, while the cream is qmte 
Boft, stir into it the nuts, and then form into balls, bars or squares. Several 
kinds of nuts may be mixed together. 

MAPLE SUGAR CREAMS. 

Grate fine maple sugar and mix in quantity to suit the taste, with " French 
Cream; " make any shape desired. Walnut creams are sometimes made with 
maple sugar and are very fine. 



CONFECTIONERY. ipx 

STICK CANDY. 
One pound of granulated sugar, one cupful of water, a quarter of a cupful of 
vinegar, or half a teaspoonful of cream tartar, one small tablespoonful of 
glycerine. Flavor with vaniUa, rose or lemon. Boil all except the flavoring, 
without stirring, twenty minutes or half an hour, or until crisp when dropped 
in water. Just before pouring upon greased platters to cool, add half a tea- 
spoonful of soda. After pouring upon platters to cool, poinr two teaspoonfuls of 
flavoring over the top. When partly cool, puU it until very white. Draw it 
into sticks the size you wish, and cut off with shears into sticks or kiss shaped 
drops. It may be colored if desired. (See page 395, for coloring.) 

CHOCOLATE CARAMELS. 
One cupful of grated chocolate, two cupfuls of brown sugar, one cupful ol 
West India molasses, one cupful of milk or cream, butter the size of an egg, 
boil until thick, almost brittle, stirring constantly. Turn it out on to buttered 
plates, and when it begins to stiffen, mark it in small squares so that it will 
break easily when cold. Some hke it flavored with a tablespoonful of vanilla. 

GRILLED ALMONDS. 

These are a very delicious candy seldom met with out of France. They are 
rather more trouble to make than other kinds, but well repay it from their novel 
flavor. Blanch a cupful of almonds; dry them thoroughly. Boil a cupful of 
sugar and a quarter of a cupful of water tiU it "hairs," then throw in the 
almonds; let them fry, as it were, in this syrup, stirring them occasionally; they 
will turn a faint yellow brown before the sugar changes color; do not wait an 
instant once this change of color begins, or they will lose flavor; remove them 
from the fire, and stir them until the syrup has turned back to sugar and clings 
irregularly to the nuts. 

These are grilled almonds. You wiU find them deUcious, as they are to alter- 
nate at dinner with the salted almonds now so fashionable. 

PEPPERMINT DROPS. 
One cupful of sugar, crushed fine, and just moistened with boiling water, 
then boiled five minutes; then take from the fire and add cream of tartar the 
size of a pea; mix well and add four or five drops of oil of peppermint. Beat 
briskly tmtil the mixture whitens, then drop quickly upon white paper. Have 
the cream of tartar and oU. of peppermint measured while the sugar is boiling. 
If it sugars before it is all dropped, add a Uttle water and boil a minute or two. 



402 CONFECTIONERY. 

CURRANT DROPS. 

Use currant-juice, instead of water, to moisten a quantity of sugar. Put ifc 
in a pan and heat, stirring constantly; be sure not to let it boU; then mix a very 
little more sugar, let it warm with the rest a moment; tfiien, with a smooth stick, 
drop on paper. 

LEMON DROPS. 

Upon a coffee-cupful of finely powdered sugar, pour just enough lemon-juice 
to dissolve it, and boil it to the consistency of thick syrup, and so that it appears 
brittle when dropped ia cold water. Drop this on buttered plates in drops; set 
away to cool and harden. 

NUT MOLASSES CANDY. 
When making molasses candy, add any kiud of nuts you fancy; put them in 
after the syrup has thickened, and is ready to take from the fire; pour out on 
buttered tins. Mark it off in squares before it gets too cool. Peanuts should be 
fresh roasted and then tossed in a sieve, to free them of their inner skins. 

SUGAR NUT CANDY. 

Three pounds of white sugar; half a pint of water; half a pint of vinegar; a 
quarter of a pound of butter; one pound of liickory-nut kernels. Put the sugar, 
butter, vinegar and water together into a thick sauce-pan. When it begins ta 
thicken, add the nuts. To test it, take up a very small quantity as quickly as 
possible directly from the centre, taking care not to disturb it any more than is 
necessary. Drop it into cold water, and remove from the fire the moment the 
little particles are brittle. Pour into buttered plates. Use any nuts with this 
recipe. 

COCOANUT CANDY. 

One cocoanut, one and one-half pounds of granulated sugar. Put sugar and 
milk of cocoanut together, heat slowly until the sugar is melted, then boil five 
minutes; add cocoanut (finely grated), boil ten minutes longer, stir constantly 
to keep from burning. Pour on buttered plates, cut in squares. Will take about 
two days to harden. Use prepared cocoanut when other cannot be had. 

BUTTER-SCOTCH. 

Three cupfuls of white sugar, half a cupful of water, half a cupful of vinegar, 

or half a teaspoonful of cream tartar; a tablespoonful of butter and eight drops 

of extract of lemon. Boil without stirring, tiU it wiU snap and break. Just 

before taking from the fire, add a quarter of a teaspoonful of soda; pour into 



CONFECTIONERY. 403 

Well-buttered biscuit tins, a quarter of an inch thick. Mark off into inch 
squares when partly cold. 

EVERTON TAFFY, OR BUTTER-SCOTCH. 

Two cupfuls of sugar, two cupfuls of dark molasses, one cupful of cold butter, 
grated rind of half a lemon. Boil over a slow fire untU it hardens when dropped 
in cold water. Pour thinly into tins well-buttered, and mark into httle inch 
squares, before it cools. 

MAPLE WALNUTS. 

Beat the white of one egg to a stiff froth, stir in enough powdered sugar to 
make it like hard frosting, dip the walnut meats (which you have taken care 
to remove from the shells without breaking) in a syrup made by boiUng for two 
or three minutes two tablespoonf uls of maple sugar in one of water, or in this 
proportion. Press some of the hard frosting between the two halves of the 
walnut, and let it harden. Dates may be prepared in this way, and butternuts 
and EngUsh walnuts also. 

POP-CORN CANDY. No. i. 

Put into an iron kettle one tablespoonf ul of butter, three tablespoonfuls of 
water and one cupful of white sugar; boil until ready to candy, then throw in 
three quarts nicely popped corn; stir vigorously until the sugar is evenly dis- 
tributed over the com; take the kettle from the fire and stir imtU it cools a little, 
and in this way you may have each kernel separate and all coated with the 
sugar. Of course it must have your undivided attention from the first, to pre- 
vent scorching. Almonds, English walnuts, or, in fact, any nuts are deUcious 
prepared in this way. 

POP-CORN CANDY, No. 2. 

Having popped your com, salt it and keep it warm, sprinkle over with a 
whisk broom a mixture composed of an ounce of gum arabic, and a half pound 
of sugar, dissolved in two quarts of water; boU all a few minutes. Stir the com 
with the hands or large spoon thoroughly; then mold into balls with the hands. 

POP-CORN BALLS. No. 3. 

Take three large ears of pop-corn (rice is best). After popping, shake it 
down in pan so the unpopped com will settle at the bottom; put the nice white 
popped in a greased pan. For the candy, take one cup of molasses, one cup of 
hght brown or white sugar, one tablespoonf ul of vinegar. BoU vmtil it will 
harden in water. Pour on the com. Stir with a spoon imtU thoroughly mixed; 
then mold into balls with the hand. 



404 CONFECTIONBRy. 

No flavor should be added to this mixture, as the excellence of this com- 
modity depends entirely upon the united flavor of the com, salt and the sugar or 
molasses. 

HOARHOUND CANDY. 

Boil two ounces of dried hoarhound in a pint and a half of water for about 
half an hour; strain, and add three and a half pounds of brown sugar; boil ovei 
a hot fire until sufficiently hard; pour out in flat, well-greased tins and marked 
into sticks or small sqiiares with a knife as soon as cool enough to retain its shape. 

JUJUBE PASTE. 
Two cupfuls of sugar, one-quarter of a pound of gum arable, one pint of 
water. Flavor with the essence of lemon, and a grain of cochiueal. Let the 
mixture stand, until the gum is dissolved, in a warm place on the back of the 
stove, then draw forward and cook until thick; try in cold water; it should be 
limber and bend when cold. Pour ia buttered pans, an eighth of an inch thick; 
when cool, roU up ia a scroll. 

CANDIED ORANGES. 

Candied orange is a great delicacy, which is easily made: Peel and quarter 
the oranges; make a syrup in the proportion of one pound of sugar to one pint 
of water; let it boil until it will harden in water; then take it from the fire and 
dip the quarters of orange in the syrup; let them drain on a fine sieve placed 
over a platter, so that the syrup wiU not be wasted; let them drain this until 
cool, when the sugar wiU crystahze. These are nice served with the last coiu-se 
of dinner. Any fruit the same. 

FIG CANDY. 

One cup of sugar, one-third cup of water, one-fourth teaspoonful cream of 
tartar. Do not stir while boiling. Boil to amber color, stir in the cream of tartar 
just before taking from the fire. Wash the figs, open and lay in a tin pan and 
pour the candy over them. Or you va^^ dip them in the syrup the same as 
"Candied Oranges." 

CANDY ROLEY POLEV. 

Take half a pint of citron, half a pint of raisins, half a pound of figs, a quar- 
ter of a pound of shelled almonds, one pint of peanuts before they are hulled; 
cut up the citron, stone the raisins, blanch the almonds, and huU the peanuts; 
cut up the figs into small bits. Take two poimds of coffee-sugar, and moisten 
with vinegar; put in a piece of butter as large as a walnut; stew tiU it hardens, 
but take off before it gets to the brittle stage; beat it with a spoon six or eight 



CONFECTIONERY. 405 

times; then stir in the mixed fruits and nuts. Pour into a wet cloth and roll it 
up like a pudding, twisting the ends of the cloth to mold it. Let it get cold, and 
sUce off pieces as it may be wanted f 01* eating. 

MOLASSES CANDY. 

Put one quart of West India molasses, one cupful of brown sugar, a piece of 
butter the size of half an egg, into a six-quart kettle. Let it boil over a slack 
fire until it begins to look thick, stirring it often to prevent burniag. Test it by 
taking some out aad dropping a few drops in a cup of cold water. If it hardens 
quickly and breaks short between the teeth it is boiled enough. Now put in haK 
a teaspoonful of baking soda, and stir it weU; then pour it out into weU-buttered, 
flat tins. When partly cooled, take up the candy with your hands well 
buttered, then pull and double, and so on, imtU the candy is a whitish yellow. 
It may be cut in strips and rolled or twisted. 

If flavoring is desired, drop the flavoriag on the top as it begins to cool, and 
when it is pulled, the whole will be flavored. 

STRAWBERRY CONSERVE. 

Prepare the fruit as for preserving, allowing half a pound of loaf sugar to 
one pound of fruit. Sprinkle the sugar over the fruit at night; in the morning, 
put it on the fire in a kettle, and boil until the berries are clear. Spread on 
dishes, and put in the sun until dry; after which, roU the fruit ia sugar, and 
pack in jars. 

PEACH CONSERVE. 

Halve the peaches and take out the stones; pare. Have ready some pow- 
dered white sugar on a plate or dish. EoH the peaches in it several times, until 
they will not take up any more. Place them singly on a plate, with the cup or 
hoUow side up, that the juices may not run out. Lay them in the sun. The 
next morning roU them again. As soon as the juice seems set in the peaches, 
turn the other side to the sun. When they are thoroughly dry, pack them in 
glass jars, or, what is still nicer, fig-drums. They make an excellent sweetmeat 
just as they are; or, if wanted for table use, put over the fire in porcelain, with 
a very httle water, and stew a few minutes. 

PEACH LEATHER. 

Stew as many peaches as you choose, allowing a quarter of a pound of sugar 
to one of fruit; mash it up smooth as it cooks, and when it is dry enough to 
spread in a thin sheet on a board greased with butter, set it out in the sun 
(to dry; when dry it can be rolled up hke leather, wrapped up in a cloth, and

■will keep perfectly from season to season. School-children regard it as a delight- 
ful addition to their lunch of biscuit or cold bread. Apple and quince leather 
are made in the same fashion, only a Uttle flavoring or spice is added to them, 

COCOANUT CARAMELS. 
Two cupf uls of grated cocoanut, one cupful of sugar, two tablespoonfuls of 
flour, the whites of three eggs, beaten stiff. Soak the cocoanut, if dessicated, 
in milk enough to cover it; then beat the whites of the eggs, add gradually the- 
sugar, cocoanut, and flour; with your fingers make, by rolling the mixture, 
into cone shapes. Place them on buttered sheets of tin, covered with buttered 
letter-paper, and bake in a moderate heat about fifteen or twenty minutes. 
They should cool before removing from the tins. 

DRIED PRESERVES. 
Any of the fruits that have been preserved in syrup may be converted into- 
dry preserves, by first draining them from the syrup and then drying them slowly 
on the stove, strewing them thickly with powdered sugar. They should be 
turned every few hours, sifting over them more sugar. 

CANDIES WITHOUT COOKING. 
Very many candies made by confectioners are made without boiling, which 
makes them very desirable, and they are equal to the best " French Creams." 
The secret lies in the sugar used, which is the XXX powdered or confectioners' 
sugar. Ordinary powdered sugar, when rubbed between the thumb and finger 
has a decided grain, but the confectioners' sugar is fine as flour. The candies< 
made after this process are better the day after. 

FRENCH VANILLA CREAM. 

Break into a bowl the white of one or more eggs, as the quantity you wish 
to make wiU require; add to it an equal quantity of cold water, then stir in XXX 
powdered or confectioners' sugar until you have it stiff enough to mold inta 
shape with the fingers. Flavor with vanilla to taste. After it is formed in 
balls, cubes or lozenge shapes, lay them upon plates or waxed paper, and set 
them aside to dry. This cream can be worked in candies similar to the French 
cooked cream. 

CHOCOLATE CREAM DROPS. 

These are made or molded into cone-shape forms with the fingers, from the 
uncooked " French Cream, " similar to that which is cooked. After forming 
into these httle balls or cones, lay them on oiled paper until the next day, ta 



CONFECTIONER Y. 407 

haxden, or make them in the morning and leave them until afternoon. Then 
melt some chocolate (the best confectioners') in a basin set in another basin of 
boiUng water; when melted, and the creams are hard enough to handle, take 
one at a time on a fork, and drop into the melted chocolate, roU it untU well 
covered, then sUp from the fork upon oUed or waxed paper, and set them aside 
to harden. 

FRUIT AND NUT CREAMS. 
Haisins seeded, currants, figs and citron, chopped fine, and mixed with the 
vmcooked " French Cream," whUe soft, before the sugar is aU. mixed in, makes 
a deUcious variety. Nuts also may be mixed with this cream, stirring into it 
chopped almonds, hickory nuts, butternuts, or EngUsh walnuts, then forming 
them into balls, bars or squares. Several kinds of nuts may be mixed together, 

ORANGE DROPS. 

Grate the rind of one orange and squeeze the juice, taking care to reject the 
seeds; add to this a pinch of tartaric acid; then stir in confectioners' sugar until 
it is stiff enough to form iato smaU baUs the size of a small marble. This is 
dehcious candy. 

The same process for lemon drops, using lemons in place of orange. Color a 
faint yellow 

COCOANUT CREAMS. 

Make the uncooked cream as in the foregoing recipe. Take the cream while 
soft, add fresh grated cocoanut to taste; add sufficient confectioners' sugar to 
mol^ into baUs and then roll the balls in the fresh grated cocoanut. These 
may be colored pink with a few drops of cochineal syrup, also brown by adding 
a few spoonfuls of grated chocolate; then roUing them in grated cocoanut; the 
three colors are very pretty together. The cocoanut cream may be made into a 
flat cake and cut into squares or strips. 

With this uncooked cream, aU the recipes given for the cooked "French 
Cream," may be used: — Enghsh walnut creams, variegated creams, etc., etc 



Boiling water is a very important desideratum in the making of a good cup 
of coffee or tea, but the average housewife is very apt to overlook this fact. 
Do not boil the water more than three or four minutes; longer boiling ruins the 
water for coffee or tea-making, as most of its natural properties escape by 
evaporation, leaving a veiy insipid hquid, composed mostly of hme and iron, that 
would ruin the best coffee, and give the tea a dark, dead look, which ought to 
be the reverse. 

Water left in the tea-kettle over night must never he used for preparing the 
breakfast coffee; no matter how excellent your coffee or tea may be, it will be 
ruined by the addition of water that has been boiled more than once. 

THE HEALING PROPERTIES OF TEA AND COFFEE. 

The medical properties of these two beverages are considerable. Tea is used 
advantageously in inflammatory diseases and as a cure for the headache. Coffee 
is supposed to act as a preventive of gravel and gout, and to its influence is 
ascribed the rarity of those diseases in France and Turkey. Both tea and coffee 
powerfully counteract the effects of opium and intoxicating liquors; though, 
when taken in excess, and without noiuishing food, they themselves produce, 
temporarily at least, some of the more disagreeable consequences incident to the 
use of ardent spirits. In general, however, none but persons possessing great 
mobility of the nervous system, or enfeebled or effeminate constitutions, are 
injuiiously affected by the moderate use of tea and coffee in coimection with food. 

COFFEE. 

One full coffee-cupful of ground coffee, stirred with one egg and part of the 
shell, adding a half cupful of cold water. Put it into the coffee boiler, and pour 
oi) to it a quart of boihng water; as it rises and begins to boil, stir it down with 
a silver spoon or fork. Boil hard for ten or twelve minutes. Remove from the 



COFFEE, TEA, BEVERAGES. 409 

fire, and pour out a cupful of coffee, then pour back into the coffee- pot. Place 
it on the back of the stove or range, where it will keep hot, (and not boil); it 
win settle in about five minutes. Send to the table hot. Serve with good 
cream and lump sugar. Three-quarters of a pound of Java and a quarter of a 
pound of Mocha make the best mixture of coffee. 

VIENNA COFFEE. 
Equal parts of Mocha and Java coffee; allow one heaping tablespoonful of 
coffee to each person, and two extra to make good strength. Mix one egg with 
grounds; pour on coffee half as much boiUng water as wHi be needed; let coffeb 
froth, then stir down grounds, and let boil five minutes; then let coffee stand 
where it wiU keep hot, but not boil, for five or ten minutes, and add rest a\ 
water. To one pint of cream add the white of an egg, weU-beaten; this is tf 
be put in cups with sugar, and hot coffee added. 

FILTERED OR DRIP COFFEE. 

For each person allow a large tablespoonful of finely ground coffee, and to 
every tablespoonfxil aEow a cupful of boiling water; the coffee to be one part 
Mocha to two of Java. 

Have a small iron ring made to fit the top of the coffee-pot inside, and to 
this ring sew a small muslin bag (the muslin for the purpose must not be too 
thin). Fit the bag into the pot, pour some bofiing water in it, and, when the 
pot is well- warmed, put the ground coffee into the bag; pour over as much boil- 
ing water as is required, close the lid, and, when aU the water has filtered 
through, remove the bag, and send the coffee to table. Making it in this manner 
prevents the necessity of pouring the coffee from one vessel to another, which 
cools and spoils it. The water should be poured on the coffee gradually so that 
the infusion may be stronger; and the bag must be well made that none of the 
grounds may escape through the seams and so make the coffee thick and muddy. 

Patented coffee-pots on this principle can be purchased at most house- 
rjirnishing stores. 

ICED COFFEE. 

Make more coffee than usual at breakfast time and stronger. When cold 
((UL on ice. Serve with cracked ice in each tumbler. 

SUBSTITUTE FOR CREAM IN COFFEE. 
Beat the white of an egg put to it a small lump of butter and pour the coffee 
into it gi-adually, stirring it so that it will not curdle. It is difficult to distinguish 
this fi'om fresh cream. 



4IO COFFEE, TEA, BEVERAGES. 

Many drop a tiny piece of sweet butter into their cup of hot coffee as a sub- 
stitute for cream. 

TO MAKE TEA. 

AUow two teaspoonfuls of tea to one large cupful of boiling water. Scald the 
teapot, put in the tea, pour on about a cupful of hailing water, set it on the fire 
in a warm place where it will not boU, but keep very hot, to almost boiling; let 
it steep or " draw" ten or twelve minutes. Now flU up with as much boiling 
water as is required. Send }vot to the table. It is better to use a china or porce- 
lain teapot, but if you do use metal let it be tin, new, bright and clean; never use 
it when the tin is worn off and the iron exposed. If you do you are drinking 
tea-ate of iron. 

To make tea to perfection, boiling water must be poured on the leaves 
directly it boUs. Water which has been boiling more than five minutes, or 
which has previously boiled, should on no accoimt be used. If the water does 
not boU, or if it be allowed to overboil, the leaves of the tea will be only half- 
opened and the tea itself will be quite spoiled. The water should be allowed to 
remain on the leaves from ten to fifteen minutes. 

A Chinese being interviewed for the Cooh says: Drink yotir tea plain. 
Don't add milk or sugar. Tea- brokers and tea-tasters never do; epicures never 
do; the Chinese never do. Milk contains fibrin, albumen or some other stuff, 
and the tea a dehcate amount of tannin. Mixing the two makes the liquid 
turbid. This turbidity, if I remember the cylopsedia aright, is tannate of fibrin, 
or leather. People who put milk: in tea are therefore drinking boots and shoes 
in mild disguise. 

ICED TEA. 
Is now served to a considerable extent during the summer months. It is of 
course used without milk, and the addition of sugar serves only to destroy the 
finer tea flavor. It may be prepared some hours in advance, and should be 
made stronger than when served hot. It is bottled and placed in the ice-chest 
tiU required. Use the black or green teas, or both, mixed, as fancied. 

CHOCOLATE. 

Allow half a cupful of grated chocolate to a pint of water and a piat of Tnilk, 
Rub the chocolate smooth in a httle cold water, and stir into the boihng water. 
BoU twenty minutes, add the milk and boil ten minutes more, stirring it often. 
Sweeten to your taste. 

The French put two cupfuls of boiling water to each cupful of chocolate. 



COFFEE, TEA, BEVERAGES. 411 

rhey throw in the chocolate just as the water commences to boil. Stir it with 
a spoon as soon as it boils up, add two cupfuls of good milk, and when it has 
boiled sufficiently, serve with a spoonful of thick whipped cream with each cup. 

COCOA. 

Six tablespoonfuls of cocoa to each pint of water, as much milk as water, 
sugar to taste. Eub cocoa smooth in a Uttle cold water; have ready on the fire 
a pint of boiling water; stir in grated cocoa paste. Boil twenty minutes,, add 
milk and boil five minutes more, stirring often. Sweeten in cups so as to suit 
different tastes. 

BUTTERMILK AS A DRINK. 

Buttermilk, so generally regarded as a waste product, has latterly been com- 
ing somewhat into vogue, not only as a nutrient, but as a therapeutic agent, 
and in an editorial article the Canada Lancet, some time ago, highly extoUed 
its virtues. Buttermilk may be roughly described as mUk which has lost most 
of its fat and a small percentage of casein, and which has become sour by fer- 
mentation. Long experience has demonstrated it to be an agent of superior 
digestibility. It is, indeed, a true milk peptone — that is, milk already partially 
digested, the coagulation of the coagulable portion being loose and flaky, and not 
of that firm indigestible nature which is the result of the action of the gastric 
juice upon sweet cow's milk. It resembles koumiss in its nature, and, with the 
exception of that article, it is the most grateful, refreshing, and digestible of 
the products of milk. It is a decided laxative to the bowels, a fact which must 
be borne in mind in the treatment of typhoid fever, and which may be turned 
to advantage in the treatment of habitual constipation. It is a diuretic, and 
may be prescribed with advantage in some kidney troubles. Owing to its 
acidity, combined with its laxative properties, it is beheved to exercise a general 
impression on the Uver. It is weU adapted to many cases where it is customary 
to recommend hme water and milk. It is invaluable in the treatment of dia- 
betes, either exclusively, or alternating with skimmed milk. In some cases of 
gastric ulcer and cancer of the stomach, it is the only food that can be retained.

CURRANT WINE. No. i. 

The currants should be qviite ripe. Stem, mash and strain them, adding a 

half pint of water and less than a pound of sugar to a quart of the mashed 

fruit. Stir well up together, and pour into a clean cask, leaving the bimg-hole 

open, or covered with a piece of lace. It should stand for a month to ferment,

when it will be ready for bottling; just before bottling you may add a small 
quantity of brandy or whiskey. 

CURRANT WINE. No. 2. 
To each quart of currant juice, add two quarts of soft water and three pounds 
of brown sugar. Put into a jug or small keg, leaving the top open until fer- 
mentation ceases, and it looks clear. Draw off and cork tightly.

BLACKBERRY WINE. No. i. 
Cover your blackberries with cold water; crush the berries well with a wooden 
masher; let them stand twenty-four hours; then strain, and to one gallon of 
juice put three povmds of common brown sugar; put into wide-mouthed jars for 
several days, carefully skimming oif the scum that will rise to the top; put in 
several sheets of brown paper, and let them remain in it three days; then skim 
again, and pour through a funnel into your cask. There let it remain undis- 
turbed tiU March; then strain again, and bottle. These directions, if carefully 
followed out, will insure you excellent wine.

with a tap; pour on sufficient boiling water to cover them; when cool enough 
to bear your hand, bruise well until all the berries are broken; cover up, let 
stand tmtil berries begin to rise to top, which will occur in three or four days. 
Then draw off the clear juice in another vessel, and add one pound of sugar to 
every ten quarts of the Uquor, and stir thoroughly. Let stand six to ten days 
in first vessel with top; then draw off through a jelly bag. Steep four ounces 
of isinglass in a pint of wine for twelve hours; boil it over a slow fire tiU all 
dissolved, then place dissolved isinglass in a gallon of blackberry juice, give them 
a boil together, and pour all into the vessel. Let stand a few days to ferment 
and settle, draw off and keep in a cool place. Other berry wines may be made 
in the same manner. 

GRAPE WINE. 
Mash the grapes and strain them through a cloth; put the skins in a tub after 
squeezing them, with barely enough water to cover them; strain the juice thus 
obtained into the first portion; put three pounds of sugar to one gallon of the 
mixture; let it stand in an open tub to ferment, covered with a cloth, for a 
period of from three to seven days: skim off what rises every morning. Put;

the juice in a cask, and leave it open for twenty-four hours; then bung it up, 
and put clay over the bung to keep the air out. Let your wine remain in the 
cask until March, when it should be drawn off and bottled. 

FLORIDA ORANGE WINE. 

"Wipe the oranges with a wet cloth, peel off the yellow rind very thin, squeeze 
the oranges, and strain the juice through a hair sieve; measure the juice after 
it is strained, and for each gallon aUow three pounds of granulated sugar, the 
white and sheU of one egg, and one-third of a gallon of cold water; put the sugar, 
the white and shell of the egg (crushed small) and the water over the fire, and stir 
them every two minutes imtil the eggs begins to harden; then boil the syrup 
untU it looks clear under the froth of egg which wiU form on the surface; strain 
the syrup, pour it upon the orange rind, and let it stand over night; then next 
add the orange- juice and again let it stand over night; strain ifc the second day, 
and put it into a tight cask with a small cake of compressed yeast to about ten 
gallons of wine, and leave the bung out of the cask until the wine ceases to 
ferment; the hissing noise continues as long as fermentation is in progress; when 
fermentation ceases, close the cask by driving in the bung, and let the wine 
stand about nine months before bottling it; three months after it is bottled, it 
can be used. A glass of brandy added to each gallon of wine after fermentation 
ceases is generally considered an improvement. 

There are seasons of the year when Florida oranges by the box are very 
cheap, and this fine wine can be made at a small expense. 

METHELIN, OR HONEY WINE. 

This is a very ancient and popular drink in the north of Europe. To some 
new honey, strained, add spring water; put a whole egg into it; boU this liquor 
tm the egg swims above the liquor; strain, pour it in a cask. To every fifteen 
gallons add two ounces of white Jamaica ginger, bruised, one ounce of cloves 
and mace, one and a half ounces of cinnamon, all bruised together, and tied up 
in a musUn bag; accelerate the fermentation with yeast; when worked suffi- 
ciently, bung up; in six weeks draw off into bottles. 

Another Mead. — BoU the combs, from which the honey has been drained, with 
sufficient water to make a tolerably sweet Uquor; ferment this with yeast, and 
proceed as per previous formula. 

Saxik Mead is made by adding a handful of hops and sufficient brandy to the 
comb liquor.

BLACK CURRANT WINE. 

Four quarts of whiskey, four quaxts of black currants; four pounds of brown 
or white sugar, one tablespoonful of cloves; one tablespoonful of cinnamon. 

Crush the currants, and let them stand in the whiskey with the spices for 
three weeks; then strain and add the sugar; set away again for three weeks 
longer; then strain and bottle. 

RAISIN WINE. 
Take two pounds of raisias, seed and chop them, a lemon, a pound of white 
sugar, and about two gallons of boihng water. Pour into a stone jar, and stir 
daily for six or eight days. Strain, bottle, and put in a cool place for ten days 
or so, when the wine will be ready for use. 

CHERRY BOUNCE. 
To one gallon of wild cherries add enough good whiskey to cover the fruit. 
Let soak two or three weeks and then drain off the liquor. Mash the cherries 
without breaking the stones and strain through a jelly-bag; add this liquor to 
that already drained off. Make a syrup with a giU of water and a pound of 
white sugar to every two quarts of liquor thus prepared; stir in well and bottle, 
and tightly cork. A common way of making cherry bounce is to put wild 
cherries and whiskey together in a jug and use the hquor as wanted. 

BLACKBERRY CORDIAL. 
"Warm and squeeze the berries; add to one pint of juice one poumd of white 
sugar, one-half ounce of powdered cinnamon, one-fourth ounce of mace, two 
teaspoonfuls of cloves. Boil aU together for one-fourth of an hour; strain the 
syrup, and to each pint add a glass of French brandy. Two or three doses of a 
tablespoonful or less wiU check any slight diarrhoea. When the attack is 
violent, give a tablespoonful after each discharge, until the complaint is in 
subjection. It will arrest dysentery if given in season, and is a pleasant and 
safe remedy. Excellent for children when teething. 

HOP BEER. 
Take five quarts of water, six ounces of hops, boil it three hours; then strain 
the liquor, add to it five quarts of water, four ounces of bruised ginger root, boil 
this again twenty minutes, strain and add four poimds of sugar. When luke- 
warm, put in a pint of yeast. Let it ferment; in twenty-four hours it wiU be 
ready for bottling. 



COFFEE, TEA, BEVERAGES. 415 

GINGER BEER. 
Put into a kettle two ounces of powdered ginger root (or more if it is not 
very strong), half an ounce of cream of tartar, two large lemons, cut in sUces, 
two pounds of broken loaf sugar, and two gallons of soft boiling water. Simmer 
them over a slow fire for half an hour. When the Uquor is nearly cold, stir into 
it a large tablespoonful of the best yeast. After it has fermented, which will 
be in about twenty-four hours, bottle for use. 

SPRUCE BEER. 

Allow an oimce of hops and a spoonful of ginger to a gallon of water. When 
weU.boUed, strain it, and put in a pint of molasses, or a pound of brown sugar, 
and half an ounce or less of the essence of spruce; when cool, add a teacupful 
of yeast, and put into a clean, tight cask, and let it ferment for a day or two, 
then bottle it for use. You can boil the sprigs of spruce fir in place of the 
essence. 

ROMAN PUNCH. No. i. 

Grate the yeUow rind of four lemons and two oranges upon two pounds of 
loaf sugar. Squeeze the juice of the lemons and oranges; cover the juice and 
let it stand until the next day. Strain it through a sieve, mix with the sugar; 
add a bottle of champagne and the whites of eight eggs beaten to a stiff froth. 
It may be frozen or not, as desired. For winter use snow instead of ice. 

ROMAN PUNCH. No. 2. 
Make two quarts of lemonade, rich with pure juice lemon fruit; add one 
tablespoonful of extract of lemon. Work well, and freeze; just before serving, 
add for each quart of ice half a pint of brandy and half a pint of Jamaica rum. 
Mix well and serve in high glasses, as this makes what is called a semi or haJf- 
ice. It is usually served at dinners as a cowp de milieu. 

DELICIOUS JUNKET. 

Take two quarts of new mOk, warm it on the stove to about blood-heat; 
pour it into a glass or china bowl, and stir into it two tablespoonf uls of Grosse & 
BlackweU's prepared rennet, two tablespoonfuls of powdered loaf sugar, and a 
small wine-glassful of pale brandy. Let it stand till cold and eat with sugar and 
rich cream. Half the quantity can be made. 

RASPBERRY SHRUB. 
One quart of raspberry juice, half a pound of loaf sugar, dissolved, a pint of 
Jamaica rum, or part rum and brandy. Mix thoroughly. Bottle for use.

SASSAFRAS MEAD. 
Mix gradually with two quarts of boiling water three pounds and a half of 
the best brown sugar, a pint and a half of good West India molasses, and a 
quarter of a pound of tartaric acid. Stir it well,, and when cool, strain it into 
a large jug or pan, then mix in a teaspoonful (not more) of essence of sassafras. 
Transfer it to clean bottles, (it will fill about half a dozen,) cork it tightly, and 
keep it in a cool place. It will be fit for use next day. Put into a box or boxes 
a quarter of a pound of carbonate of soda, to use with it. To prepare a glass of 
sassafras mead for drinking, put a large tablespoonful of the mead into a half 
tumbler full of ice- water, stir into it a half teaspoonful of the soda, and it wiU 
tenmediately foam up to the top. 

Sassafras mead will be found a cheap, wholesome, and pleasant beverage for 
s^arm weather. The essence of sassafras, tartaric acid and carbonate of soda, 
tan, of course, aU be obtained at the druggist's. 

CREAM SODA WITHOUT THE FOUNTAIN. 

Coffee-sugar, four pounds; three pints of water, three nutmegs, grated, the 
whites of ten eggs, weU-beaten, gum arable, one ounce; twenty drops of oil of 
lemon, or extract equal to that amount. By using oils of other fruits, you can 
make as many flavors from this as you desire. Mix all, and place over a gentle 
fire, and stir well about thirty minutes; remove from the fire and strain, and 
divide into two parts; into one-half put eight ounces of bi -carbonate of soda, into 
the other half put six ounces of tartaric acid. Shake well, and when cold they 
are ready for use by pouring three or four spoonfuls from both parts into sepa- 
rate glasses, each one-third full of water. Stir each and pour together, and you 
have a nice glass of cream soda which you can drink at your leisure, as the gum 
and eggs hold the gas. 

WINE WHEY. 

Sweeten one pint of milk to taste, and when bofiing, throw in two wine- 
glasses of sherry; when the curd forms, strain the whey through a mushn bag 
into tumblers. 

LEMON SYRUP. 

Take the juice of twelve lemons; gi'ate the rind of six in it, leb it stand over 
night; then take six pounds of white sugar, and make a thick syrup. When it 
is quite cool, strain the juice into it, and squeeze as much oil from the grated 
rind as will suit the taste. Put in bottles, securely corked, for future use. A 
tablespoonful in a goblet of water will make a delicious drink on a hot day. 



COFFEE, TEA, BEVERAGES. 417 

FOR A SUMMER DRAUGHT. 
The juice of one lemon, a tumblerful of cold water, pounded sugar to taste, 
half a smaU teaspoonful of carbonate of soda. Squeeze the juice from the 
lemon; strain, and add it to the water, with sufficient pounded sugar to sweeten 
the whole nicely. When well-mixed, put in the soda, stir well, and drink while 
the mixtm-e is in an effervescing state. 

NOYEAU CORDIAL. 
To one gallon of proof spirit add three pounds of loaf sugar and a table- 
spoonful of extract of almonds. Mix weU together, and allow to stand forty- 
eight hours, covered closely; now strain through thick flannel, and bottle. This 
Uquor wiU. be much improved by adding half a pint of apricot or peach juice. 

EGG NOGG. 

Beat the yellows of twelve eggs very hght, stir in as much white sugar as 
they wiU dissolve, pour in gradually one glass of brandy to cook the eggs, one 
glass of old whiskey, one grated nutmeg, and three pints of rich mUk. Beat the 
whites to a froth and stir in last. 

EGG FLIP, OR MULLED ALE. 
Bon one quart of good ale, with some nutmeg; beat up six eggs, and mix 
them with a httle cold ale; then pour the hot ale to it, and pour it back and forth 
several times to prevent its curdling; warm, and stir it till sufficiently thick; add 
a piece of butter or a glass of brandy, and serve it with dry toast. 

MILK PUNCH. 
One pint of milk made very sweet; a wine-glassful of brandy or rum, weU- 
stirred together; grate a little nutmeg over the top of the glasses. Serve with a 
straw in each glass. 

FINE MILK PUNCH. 

Pare off the yeUow rind of four large lemons, and steep it for twenty -four 
hours in a quart of brandy or rum. Then mix with it the juice of the lemons, 
a pound and a half of loaf-sugar, two grated nutmegs, and a quart of water. 
Add a quart of rich unskimmed milk, made boiling hot, and strain the whole 
through a jeUy bag. You may either use it as soon as it is cold, or make a larger 
quantity (in the above proportions), and bottle it. It will keep several months. 



4l8 COFFEE, TEA, BEVERAGES. 

TO MAKE HOT PUNCH. 

Half a pint of rum, half a pint of brandy, quarter of a pound of sugar, one 
large lemon, half a teaspoonful of nutmeg, one pint of boiling water. 

Eub the sugar over the lemon until it has absorbed all the yeUow part of the 
skin, then put the sugar into a punch-bowl; add the lemon- juice (free from pips), 
and mix these two ingredients, well together. Pour over them the boiling water, 
stir well together, add the rum, brandy, and nutmeg; mix thoroughly and the 
punch will be ready to serve. It is very important in making good punch that 
all the ingredients are thoroughly incorporated; and to insure success, the pro- 
cesses of mixing must be diligently attended to. (This is an old-style punch.) 

LEMONADE. 
Three lemons to a pint of water makes strong lemonade; sweeten to your 
taste. 

STRAWBERRY WATER. 

Take one cupful of ripe hulled berries; crush with a wooden spoon, mixing 
with the mass a quarter of a poimd of pulverized sugar and half a pint of cold 
water. Pour the mixture iuto a fine sieve, rub through and filter tiU clear; add 
the strained juice of one lemon and one and a half pints of cold water, mix 
thoroughly, and set in ice-chest tiU wanted. 

This makes a nice, cool drink on a warm day, and easily to be made in straw- 
berry season. 

STRAWBERRY AND RASPBERRY SYRUP. 

Mash the fresh fruit, express the juice, and to each quart add three and a 
half poimds of granulated sugar. The juice, heated to 180° Fahrenheit, and 
strained or filtered previous to dissolving the sugar, will keep for an indefinite 
time, canned hot in glass jars. 

The juice of soft fruits is best when allowed to drop therefrom by its own 
weight, lightly mash the fruit and then suspend in a cloth, allowing the juice to 
drop in a vessel beneath. Many housekeepers, after the bottles and jars are 
thoroughly washed and dried, smoke them with sulphur in this way: Take a 
piece of wire and bend it around a small piece of brimstone the size of a bean; 
set the brimstone on fire, put it in the jar or bottle, bending the other end over 
the mouth of the vessel, and cover with a cork; after the brimstone has burned 
away, fill the vessel with the syrup or preserves and cover tightly. There is no 
sulphurous taste left by the process.

KOUMISS. 
Koumiss is prepared by dissolving four ounces of white sugar in one gallon 
of skimmed milk, and placing in bottles of the capacity of one quart; add two 
ounces of bakers' yeast, or a cake of compressed yeast to each bottle. Cork and 
tie securely, set in a warm place until fermentation is weU under way, and lay 
the bottles on their sides in a cool cellar. In three days, fermentation wiU have 
progressed sufficiently to permit the koumiss to be in good condition. 

PINEAPPLE VINEGAR. 

Cover sliced pine-apples with pure cider vinegar; let them stand three or four 
days, then mash and strain through a cloth as long as it runs clear; to every 
three quarts of juice add five pounds of sugar. 

Boil it aU together about ten minutes, skim carefully until nothing rises to 
the surface, take from the fire; when cool, bottle it. Blackberries and rasp- 
berries, and, in fact, any kind of highly flavored fruit, is fine; a tablespoonfuJ 
in a glass of ice-cold water, to drink in warm weather. 

RASPBERRY VINEGAR. No. I. 

Put a quart of raspberries into a suitable dish, pour over them a quart of 

good vinegar, let it stand twenty -four hours, then strain through a flannel bag, 

and pour this Uquor on another quart of berries; do this for three or four days 

successively, and strain it; make it very sweet with loaf sugar; bottle, and seal it. 

RASPBERRY VINEGAR. No. 2. 
Turn over a quart of ripe raspberries, mashed, a quart of good cider vinegar, 
add one pound of white sugar, mix well, then let stand in the sun four hours. 
Strain it, squeeze out the juice, and put in a pint of good brandy. Seal it up 
in bottles, air tight, and lay them on their sides in the cellar; cover them with 
sawdust. When used, pour two tablespoonfuls to a tumblerful of ice-water. 
Fine. 

HOME-MADE TABLE VINEGAR. 
Put in an open cask four gallons of warm rain-water, one gallon of common 
molasses, and two quarts of yeast; cover the top with thin muslin and leave it 
in the sun, covering it up at night and when it rains. In three or four weeks it 
wlU be good vinegar. If cider can be used in place of rain-water the vinegar 
will make much sooner — wiU not take over a week to make a very sharp vinegar. 
Excellent, for pickling purposes. 



420 COFFEE, TEA, BEVERAGES. 

VERY STRONG TABLE VINEGAR. 

Take two gallons of good cider and thoroughly mix it with two pounds of 
new honey, pour into your cask or bottle, and let it stand from four to six 
months, when you will have vinegar so strong that it cannot be used at table 
without diluting with water. It is the best ever procured for pickling purposes. 

PINEAPPLE-ADE. 
Pare and slice some very ripe pineapples; then cut the shces into small pieces. 
Put them with all their juice into a large pitcher, and sprinkle among them 
plenty of powdered white sugar. Pour on boiling water, allowing a small half 
pint to each pineapple. Cover the pitcher, and let it stand tiU quite cool, oc- 
casionally pressing down the pineapple with a spoon. Then set the pitcher for 
a while in ice. Lastly, strain the infusion into another vessel, and transfer it 
to tumblers, putting into each glass some more sugar and a bit of ice. This 
beverage will be found dehcious. 

SEIDLITZ POWDERS. 

Fold in a white paper a mixture of one drachm of EocheUe salts and twenty- 
five grains of carbonate of soda, in a blue paper twenty grains of tartaric 
acid. They should aU be pulverized very finely. Put the contents of the white 
paper into a tumbler, not quite half full of cold water, and stir it tiU dissolved. 
Then put the mixture from the blue paper into another tumbler with the same 
quantity of water, and stir that also. When the powders are dissolved in both 
tumblers, pour the first into the other, and it wiU effervesce immediately. Drink 
it quickly, while foaming. 

INEXPENSIVE DRINK. 
A very nice, cheap drink which may take the place of lemonade, and be found 
fuUy as healthful, is made with one cupful of pure cider vinegar, half a cupful 
of good molasses, put into one quart pitcher of ice- water. A tablespoonful of 
ground ginger added makes a healthful beverage.

Etiquette as observed in European courts is not known at the White House. 

The President's Secretary issues invitations by direction of the President, to- 
^e distinguished guests. 

The Usher m charge of the cloak-room hands to the gentleman on arrival sm 
(SBivelope containing a diagram of the table (as cut shows), whereon the name acd

ssat of the respective guest, and the lady he is to escort to dinner, are marked. 

A card corresponding with his name is placed on the napkin belonging to thfe 
©over of the seat he will occupy. 

The President's seat is in the middle of the table. The most distinguished 
guests sit on his right and left. If their wives are present they will occupy these 
seats, and the gentlemen will be seated next to the President's wife, whose seat w 
directly opposite the President 




THE GREAT STATE DINING ROOM. 



DINNERS AND RECEPTIONS. 



467 



Official dinners all over the world are always served after the French fashion, 
and are divided into three distinct parts. Two of them are served from the kitchen, 
and the third from the pantry. 

The first part of the dinner aerved French style includes from oysters on the 
shell to the sherbets. 

The second service continues to the sweet dishes. 

The third includes ice, cakes, fruits, cheeses, which are all understood as des- 
serts, and are dressed in the pantry. 

All principal dishes which are artistically decorated are shown to the President 
first, then are carried around the table before being carved by the Steward in the 
pantry. 

Fancy folding of the napkins is considered out of fashion ; plain square folded, 
so as to show monogram in the middle, is much preferred. 

The following diagram will illustrate the arrangement of the glasses on the 
table. (See diagram.) 




DIAGRAM ILLUSTRATING HOW TO ARRANGE GLASSES ON TABLE. 



A — PliAIE. 



I — Glass for Santerne. 
II — Glass for Sherry. 
Ill — Glass for Rhine Wine. 



IV— Glass *or Water. 
V — Glass for Champagne. 
VI — Glass for Burgundy. 



Flower decorations on the table are to be in flat designs, so as not to obscure 
the view of the guests. 



468 DINNERS AND RECEPTIONS. 



Corsage Bouquets for ladies consist of not more than eight large roses tied 
together by silk ribbon, with the name of the lady stamped on in gold letters. 

Gentlemen's Bouttonieres consist only of one rose bud. 

Bouquets for ladies are to be placed on the right side; for gentlemen, on the 
napkin next to card bearing his name. 

Printed Menus are never used on any official occasion. 

The private dinners Menus are either printed or written on a plain card and 
placed on each cover. 

Liquors, cordials, cigars are served on a separate table after the ladies have 
retired to the parlor. 



Dishes for invalids should be served in the daintiest and most attractive way; 
jtBVer send more than a supply for one meal; the same dish too frequently set 
before an invaUd often causes a distaste, when perhaps a change would tempt 
the appetite. 

When preparing dishes where milk is used, the condition of the patient should 
be considered. Long cooking hardens the albumen and makes the nulk very 
constipating; then, if the patient should be already constipated, care should be 
taken not to heat the milk above the boiling point. 

The seasoning of food for the sick should be varied according to the condition 
of the patient; one recovering from illness can partake of a httle piece of roast 
mutton, chicken, rabbit, game, fish, simply dressed, and simple puddings are all 
hght food and easily digested. A mutton chop, nicely cut, trimmed and broiled, 
is a dish that is often inviting to an invalid. As a rule, an invalid will be more 
likely to enjoy any preparation sent to him i£ it is served in small, dehcate 
pieces. As there are so many small, dainty dishes that can be made for this 
purpose, it seems useless to try to more than give a small variety of them. 
Pudding can be made of prepared barley, or tapioca, well-soaked before boiling, 
with an egg added, and a change can be made of hght puddings by mixing up 
some stewed fruit with the puddings before baking; a bread pudding from stale 
bread-crumbs, and a tiny cup-custard, boiled in a small basin or cup; also various 
drinks, such as milk pimch, wine, whey, apple-toddy, and various other nourish- 
ing drinks. 

BEEFSTEAK AND MUTTON CHOPS. 

Select the tenderest cuts, and broil over a clear, hot fire. Let the steak be 
rare, the chops weU done. Salt and pepper; lay between two hot plates three 
minutes, and serve to your patient. If he is very weak, do not let him swallow 
anything except the juice, when he has chewed the meat well. The essence of 
rare beef, roasted or broiled, thus expressed, is considered by some physicians to 
be more strengthening than beef tea prepared in the usual manner. 



470 FOR THE SICK. 

BEEF TEA. 
One pound of lean beef, cut into small pieces. Put into a glass canning- jwr 
without a drop of water; cover tightly, and set in a pot of cold water. Heat 
gradually to a boU, and continue this steadily for three or four hours, until the 
meat is like white rags, and the juice aU drawn out. Season with salt to taste, 
and when cold, skim. 

VEAL OR MUTTON BROTH. 

Take a scrag-end of mutton (two pounds), put it in a sauce-pan, with two 
quarts of cold water, and an ounce of pearl barley or rice. When it is coming 
to a boU, skim it weU, then add half a teaspoonful of salt; let it boil until half 
reduced, then strain it, and take off all the fat, and it is ready for use. This is 
excellent for an invahd. If vegetables are Uked in this broth, take one turnip, 
one carrot, and one onion, cut them in shreds, and boil them in the broth half 
an hour. In that case, the barley may be served with the vegetables in broth. 

CHICKEN BROTH. 

Make the same as mutton or beef broth. Boil the chicken slowly, putting 
on just enough water to cover it well, watching it closely that it does not boil 
down too much. When the chicken is tender, season with salt and a very little 
pepper. The yolk of an egg beaten light and added, is very nourishing 

DATMEAL GRUEL. 

Put four tablespoonfuls of the best grits (oatmeal coarsely ground) into a 
pint of boihng water. Let it boU gently, and stir it often, tiU it becomes as thick 
as you wish it. Then strain it, and add to it while warm, butter, wine, nutmeg, 
or whatever is thought proper to flavor it. Salt to taste. 

If you make the gruel of fine oatmeal, sift it, mix it first to a thick batter 
with a httle cold water, and then put it into the sauce-pan of boiling water. 
Stir it aU the time it is boiling, hfting the spoon gently up and down, and letting 
the gruel fall slowly back again into the pan. 

CORN-MEAL GRUEL. 
Two tablespoonfuls of fine Indian meal, mixed smooth with cold water and a 
salt-spoonful of salt; add one quart of boihng water, and cook twenty minutes. 
Stir it frequently, and if it becomes too thick use boiling water to thin it." If the 
stomach is not too weak, a tablespoonful of cream may be used to cool it. 
Some like it sweetened and others like it plain. For very sick persons, let it 
settle, pour off the top, and give without other seasoning. For convalescents, 
toast a piece of bread as nicely as possible, and put it in the gruel with a table- 



FOR THE SICK. A,7l 

spoonful of nice sweet cream, and a Kttle ginger and sugar. This should be 
used only when a laxative is allowed. 

EGG GRUEL. 
Beat the yolk of an egg with one tablespoonful of sugar; pour one teacupful 
of boiling water on it; add the white of an egg, beaten to a froth, with any 
seasoning or spice desired. Take warm. 

MILK PORRIDGE. 
The same as arrowroot, excepting it should be aU milk, and thickened with 
a scant tablespoonful of sifted flour; let it boU five minutes, stirring it con- 
tinually, add a little cold mUk, and give it one boil up, and it is ready for use. 

ARROWROOT MILK PORRIDGE. 
One large cupful of fresh milk, new if you can get it; one cupful of boiling 
water; one teaspoonful of arrowroot, wet to a paste with cold water; two tea- 
spoonfuls of white sugar; a pinch of salt. Put the sugar into the milk, the salt 
into the boiling water, which should be poured into a farina-kettle. Add the 
wet arrowroot, and boU, stirring constantly until it is clear; put in the milk, and 
cook ten minutes, stirring often. Give while warm, adding hot mUk should it 
be thicker than gruel. 

ARROWROOT BLANC MANGE. 
One large cupful of boiling milk, one even tablespoonful of arrowroot rubbed 
to a paste with cold water, two teaspoonfuls of white sugar, a pinch of salt; 
flavor with rose-water. Proceed as in the foregoing recipes, boihng and stirring 
eight minutes. Turn into a wet mold, and when firm, serve with cream and 
powdered sugar. 

TAPIOCA JELLY. 

Soak a cupful of tapioca in a quart of cold water, after washing it thoroughly 
two or three times; after soaking three or four hours, simmer it in a stew-pan 
until it becomes quite clear, stirring often; add the juice of a lemon, and a lit- 
tle of the grated peel, also a pinch of salt. Sweeten to taste. Wine can be 
substituted for lemon, if hked. 

SLIPPERY-ELM BARK TEA. 
Break the bark into bits, pour bofling water over it, cover, and let it infuse 
until cold. Sweeten, ice, and take for summer disorders, or add lemon juice and 
drink for a bad cold. 



47-2 FOR THE SICK. 

FLAX-SEED TEA. 
Upon an ounce of unbruised flax-seed and a little pulverized liquorice -root 
pour a pint of boiling (soft or rain) water; and place the vessel containing these 
ingredients near, but not on, the fire for four hours. Strain through a linen 
cloth. Make it fresh every day. An excellent drink in fever accompanied by a 
cough. 

FLAX-SEED LEMONADE. 

To a large tablespoonful of flax-seed, aUow a tumbler and a half of cold water. 
Boil them together tiU the liquid becomes very sticky. Then strain it hot over 
a quarter of a pound of pulverized sugar, and an ounce of pulverized gum arabic. 
Stir it tin quite dissolved, and squeeze into it the juice of a lemon. 

This mixture has frequently been found an efficacious remedy for a cold, 
taking a wine-glass of it as often as the cough is troublesome. 

TAMARIND WATER. 

Put tamarinds into a pitcher or tumbler till it is one- third full; then fill up 
with cold water, cover it, and let it infuse for a quarter of an hour or more. 

Currant jeUy or cranberry juice mixed with water makes a pleasant drink 
for an invalid. 

SAGO JELLY. 

Made the same as tapioca. If seasoning is not advisable, the sago may be 
boiled in mflk, instead of water, and eaten plain. 

Eice jeUy made the same, using only half as much rice as sago. 

ARROWROOT WINE JELLY. 

One cupful of boiling water, one scant tablespoonful of arrowroot; mix with 
a little cold water; one tablespoonful of sugar, a piach of salt, one tablespoonful 
of brandy, or three tablespoonfuls of wine. Excellent for a sick person without 
fever. 

HOMINY. 

Put to soak one pint of hominy in two and one-half pints of boOing'^ water 
over night, in a tin vessel with a tight cover; in the morning add one-half pint 
of sweet milk, and a httle salt. Place on a brisk fire in a kettle of boiling water, 
the tin vessel containing the hominy; let boil one-half hour. 

Cracked wheat, oatmeal, mush, are aU good food for the sick. 



FOR THE SICK. 473 

CHICKEN JELLY. 
Cook a chicken in enough water to httle more than cover it; let it stew gently 
until the meat drops from the bones, and the broth is reduced to about a pint; 
season it to taste, with a little salt and pepper. Strain and press, first through 
a colander, then through a coarse cloth. Set it over the fire again, and cook a 
few minutes longer. Turn it into an earthen vegetable dish to harden; set it on 
the ice in the refrigerator. Eat cold in slices. Nice made into sandwiches, with 
tMn shoes of bread, Ughtly spread with butter. 

BOILED RICE. 
Boil half a cupful of rice in just enough water to cover it, with half a tea 
spoonfid of salt; when the water has boUed nearly out and the rice begins to look 
soft and dry, turn over it a cupful of milk, and let it simmer until the rice is 
done and nearly dry; take from the fire and beat in a weU-beaten egg. Eat it 
warm with cream and sugar. Flavor to taste. 

CUIJ PUDDING. 
Take one tablespoonful of flour, one egg; mix with cold milk and a pinch of 
salt to a batter. Boil fifteen minutes in a buttered cup. Eat with sauce, fruit, 
or plain sugar. 

TAPIOCA CUP PUDDING. 
This is very Ught and delicate for invahds. An even tablespoonful of tapioca, 
soaked for two hours in nearly a cup of new milk; stir into this the yolk of a 
fresh egg, a httle sugar, a grain of salt, and bake it in a cup for fifteen minutes. 
A httle jeUy may be eaten with it. 

BAKED APPLES. 

Get nice fruit, a httle tart and juicy, but not sour; clean them nicely, and 
bake in a moderate oven — regulated so as to have them done in about an hour; 
when the skin cracks and the pulp breaks through in every direction they are 
done and ready to take out. Serve with white sugar sprinkled over them. 

SOFT TOAST. 
Toast well, but not too brown, two thin shoes of stale bread; put them on a 
w(rarm plate, sprinkle with a pinch of salt, and pour upon them some boiling 
water; quickly cover with another dish of the same size, and drain off the water. 
Put a very small bit of butter on the toast and serve at once while hot. 



474. ^^OR THE SICK. 

IRISH MOSS BLANC MANGE. 

A small handful of moss (to be purchased at any drug store); wash it very 
carefully, and put it in one quart of milk on the fire. Let the milk simmer for 
about twenty minutes, or until the moss begins to dissolve. Then remove from 
the fire and strain through a fine sieve. Add two tablespoonfuls of sugar and 
half a teaspoonful of vanilla flavoring. Put away to harden tu cups or molds, 
and serve with sugar and cream. 

A deUcate dish for an iuvalid. 

EGG TOAST. 

Brown a sUce of bread nicely over the coals, dip it in hot water shghtly salted, 
butter it, and lay on the top an egg that has been broken into boiling water, and 
cooked until the white has hardened; season the egg with a bit of butter and a 
crumb of salt. 

The best way to cook eggs for an invalid is to drop them, or else pour boiling 
■water over the egg iu the shell and let it stand for a few minutes on the back of 
the stove, 

OYSTER TOAST. 

Make a nice slice of dry toast, butter it and lay it on a hot dish. Put six 
oysters, half a teacupful of their own liquor, and half a cupful of milk, into a 
tin cup or basin, and boil one minute. Season with a Uttle butter, pepper and 
salt, then pour over the toast and serve. 

MULLED JELLY. 

Take one tablespoonful of currant or grape jelly; beat with it the white of 
one egg and a teaspoonful of sugar; pour on it a teacupful of boihng water, and 
break in a shce of dry toast or two crackers. 

CUP CUSTARD. 
Break into a coflfee-cup an egg, put in two teaspoonfuls of sugar, beat it up 
thoroughly, a pinch of salt and a pinch of grated nutmeg; fill up the cup with 
good sweet milk ; turn it into another cup, well buttered, and set it in a pan of 
boiUng water, reaching nearly to the top of the cup. Set in the oven, and when 
the custard is set, it is done. Eat cold. 

CLAM BROTH. 
Select twelve small, hardshell clams, drain them, and chop them fine; add 
half a pint of clam juice or hot water, a pinch of cayenne, and a walnut of

butter; simmer thirty minutes; add a gill of boiled milk, strain, and serve. 
This is an excellent broth for weak stomachs. 

MILK OR CREAM CODFISH. 
This dish will often rehsh when a person is recovering from sickness, whem 
nothing else would. Pick up a large tablespoonful of salt codfish very fine; 
freshen it considerably by placing it over the fire in a basin, covering it with 
cold water as it comes to a boil; turn off the water and freshen again if very 
salt, then turn off the water imtil dry, and pour over half a cupful of milk or 
thin cream; add a bit of butter, a sprinkle of pepper, and a thickening made of 
one teaspoonful of flour or corn-starch, wet up with ahttle milk; when this boils 
up, turn over a sUce of dipped toast. 

CRACKER PANADA. 

Break in pieces three or four hard crackers that are baked quite brown, and 
let them boil fifteen minutes in one quart of water; then remove frorri the fire, 
let them stand three or four minutes, strain off the liquor through a fine wire 
sieve, and season it with sugar. 

This is a nourishing beverage for infants that are teething, and with the 
addition of a little wine and nutmeg, is often prescribed for invalids recovering 
from a fever. 

BREAD PANADA 

Put three giUs of water and one tablespoonful of white sugar on the fire, 
and just before it boils add two tablespoonfuls of the crumbs of stale white 
bread; stir it well, and let it boil three or four minutes; then add one glass of 
white wine, a grated lemon and a Uttle nutmeg; let it boil up once, then remove 
it from the fire, and keep it closely covered until it is wanted for use. 

SLIPPERY-ELM TEA. 
Put a teaspoonful of powdered sUppery-ehu into a tumbler, pour cold water 
upon it, and season with lemon and sugar. 

TOAST WATER, OR CRUST COFFEE. 
Take stale pieces of crusts of bread, the end pieces of the loaf; toast them a 
nice, dark brown, care to be taken that they do not burn in the least, as that 
affects the flavor. Put the browned crusts into a large mflk pitcher, and pour 
enough boiUng water over to cover them; cover the pitcher closely, and let steep 
until cold. Strain, and sweeten to taste; put a piece of ice in each glass. 
This is also good, drank warm with cream and sugar, similar to coffee.

PLAIN MILK TOAST, 
Cut a thin slice from a loaf of stale bread, toast it very quickly, sprinMe a 
Httle salt over it, and pour upon it three tablespoonf uls of boiling milk or cream. 
Crackers split and toasted in this manner, are often very grateful to an invalid. 

LINSEED TEA. 

Put one tablespoonful of linseed into a stew-pan with half a pint of cold 
water; place the stew-pan over a moderate fire, and, when the water is quite 
warm, pour it off, and add to the Unseed haK a pint of fresh cold water; then 
let the whole boil three or four minutes; season it with lemon and sugar. 

POWDERS FOR CHILDREN. 

A very excellent carmioative powder for flatulent nifants may be kept in the 
house, and employed with advantage whenever the child is in patn or griped, 
dropping five grains of oil of anise-seed and two of peppermint on half an ounce 
of lump sugar, and rubbing it in a mortar, with a drachm of magnesia, into a 
fine powder. A small quantity of this may be given in a httl© water at any 
time, and always with benefit. 

FOR CHILDREN TEETHING. 

Tie a quarter of a potmd of wheat flovtr in a thick cloth, and boil it in one 
quart of water for three hovirs; then remove the cloth and expose the flour to 
the air or heat until it is hard and dry; grate from it, when wanted, one table- 
spoonful, which put into half a pint of new mOk, and stir over the fire until it 
comes to a boU, when add a pinch of salt and a tablespoonful of cold water, and 
serve. This gruel is excellent for children afflicted with summer complaint. 

Or, brown a tablespoonful of flour in the oven or on top of the stove on a 
taking-tin; feed a few pinches at a time to a child, and it will often check a 
diarrhoea. The tincture of " kino " — of which from ten to thirty drops, mixed 
with a little sugar and water in a spoon, and given every two or three hours, is 
very efficacious and harmless — can be procured at almost any druggist's. 
Tablespoon doses of pure cider vinegar, and a pinch of salt, has cured when all 
else failed. 

BLACKBERRY CORDIAL. 

This recipe maybe foimd under the head of "Coffee, Tea, Beverages." it 
will be found an excellent medicine for children teething and summer diseases.

ACID DRINKS. 

1. Peel thirty large Malaga grapes, and pour half a pmt of boiling water upon 
them; cover them closely, and let them steep until the water is cold. 

2. Pour half a pint of boiUng water upon one tablespoonful of currant jelly, 
and stir until the jeUy is dissolved. 

S. Cranberries and barberries may be used in the same way to make very 
refreshing acid drinks for persons recovering from fevers. 

DRAUGHTS FOR THE FEET. 

Take a large leaf from the horseradish plant, and cut out the hard fibres that 
run through the leaf; place it on a hot shovel for a moment to soften it, fold it^ 
and fasten it closely in the hollow of the foot by a cloth bandage. 

Burdock-leaves, cabbage-leaves, and muUen-leaves, are used in the same 
manner, to alleviate pain and promote perspiration. 

Garlics are also made for draughts by pounding them, placing them on a hot 
tin plate for a moment to sweat them, and binding them closely to the hollow 
of the foot by a cloth bandage. 

Draughts of onions, for infants, are made by roasting onions in hot ashes, 
and, when they are quite soft, peeling off the outside, mashing them, and apply- 
ing them on a cloth as usuaL 

POULTICES. 

A Bread and Milk Poultice. — Put a tablespoonful of the crumbs of stale 
bread into a giU of milk, and give the whole one boil up. Or, take stale bread- 
crumbs, pour over them boiling water and boil tUl soft, stirring well; take from 
the fire and gradually stir m a httle glycerine or sweet oil, so as to render the 
poultice pliable when appUed. 

A Hop Poultice. — Boil one handful of dried hops in half a pint of water, 
until the half pint is reduced to a giD, then stir into it enough Indian meal to 
thicken it. 

A Mustard Poultice. — Into one giU of boihng water stir one tablespoonful of 
Indian meal; spread the paste thus made upon a cloth, and spread over the 
paste one teaspoonful of mustard flour. If you wish a mild poultice, use a tea- 
spoonful of mustard as it is prepared for the table, instead of the mustard flour. 

Equal parts of ground mustard and flour made iato a paste with warm water, 
and spread between two pieces of muslin, form the indispensable mustard 
plaster. 

A CUnaer Poulticp,. — This is made like a mustard poultice, using ground

ginger instead of mustard. A little vinegar is sometimes added to each of these 
poultices. 

A Stramonium Poultice.— ^ivc one tablespoonful of Indian meal into a gill ^ 
boiling water, and add one tablespoonful of bruised stramonium seeds. 

Wormwood and Arnica are sometimes applied in poultices. Steep the herbs 
^ half a pint of cold water, and when all their virtue is extracted stir in a littl« 
bran or rye-meal to thicken the liquid; the herbs must not be removed from the 
liquid. 

This is a useful appUcation for sprains and bruises. 

Linseed Poultice. — Take four ounces of powdered linseed, and gradutJly 
sprinkle it into a half pint of hot water. 

A REMEDY FOR BOILS. 

An excellent remedy for DoUs is water of a temperature agreeable to the 
teehngs of the patient. Apply wet linen to the part affected, and frequently 
renew or moisten it. It is said to be the most effectual remedy known. Take 
mwardly some good blood pvuifier. 

CURE FOR RINGWORMS. 
Yellow dock, root or leaves, steeped in vinegar, will cure the worst case o£ 
ringworm. 



HOW COLDS ARE CAUGHT. 

A great many cannot see why it is they do not take a cold when exposed tc 
sold winds and rain. The fact is, and ought to be more generally understood, 
that nearly every cold is contracted indoors, and is not directly due to the cold; 
outside, but to the heat inside. A man wiU go to bed at night feeling as well as 
osual and get up in the morning with a royal cold. He goes peeking around in 
search of cracks and keyholes and tiny drafts. Weather-strips are procuredj 
and the house made as tight as a fruit -can. In a few days more the whole 
family has colds. 

Let a man go home, tired or exhausted, eat a fuU supper of starchy and vege 
table food, occupy his mind intently for a while, go to bed in a warm, close 
room, and if he doesn't have a cold in the morning it wHl be a wonder. A drink 
of whiskey or a glass or two of beer before supper will facilitate matters very 
much. 

People swallow more colds down their throats than they inhale or receive 
from contact with the air, no matter how cold or chilly it may be. Plain, light 
suppers are good to go to bed on, and are far more conducive to refreshing 
sleep than a glass of beer or a dose of chloraL In the estimation of a greai 
many this statement is rank heresy, but in the light of science, common sense 
and experience it is gospel truth. 

Pure air is strictly essential to maintain perfect health. If a person is accus- 
tomed to sleeping with the windows open there is but httle danger of taking cold 
winter or summer. Persons that shut up the windows to keep out the " nigh4 
air " make a mistake, for at night the only air we breathe is " night air, " and 
we need good air while asleep as much or even more than at any other time of 
day. Ventilation can be accomplished by simply opening the window an inch ai 
the bottom and also at the top, thus letting the pure air in, the bad air golnjc 



48o HEALTH-SUGGESTIONS. 

outward at the top. Close, foul air poisons the blood, brings on disease which 
often results in death; this poisoning of the blood is only prevented by pure air, 
which enters the Imigs, becomes charged with woAie particles, then thrown out, 
and which are poisoning if taken back again. It is estimated that a grown 
person corrupts one gallon of pure air every minute, or twenty-five barrels fuU in 
a single night, in breathing alone. 

Clothing that has been worn through the day should be changed for fresh 
or dry ones to sleep in. Three pints of moisture, filled with the waste of the 
body, are given off every twenty-four hours, and this is mostly absorbed by the 
clothing. Sunlight and exposure to the air purifies the clothing of the poisons 
which nature is trying to dispose of, and which would otherwise be brought 
again into contact with the body. 

Colds are often taken by extreme cold and heat, and a sudden exposure to 
cold by passing from a heated room to the cold outside air. Old and weak 
persons, especially, should avoid such extreme change. In passing from warm 
crowded rooms to the cold air, the mouth shoiild be kept closed, and aU the 
breathing done through the nostrils only, that the cold air may be warmed 
before it reaches the lungs, or else the sudden change will drive the blood from 
the surface of the internal organs, often producing congestions. 

Dr. B. I. Kendall writes that " the temperature of the body should be evenly 
and properly maintained to secure perfect health; and to accompUsh this purpose 
requires great care and caution at times. The human body is, so to speak, the 
most dehcate and intricate piece of machinery that cotild possibly be conceived 
of, and to keep this in perfect order requires constant care. It is a fixed law of 
Nature that every violation thereof shall be punished; and so we find that he 
who neglects to care for his body by protecting it from sudden changes of 
weather, or draughts of cold air upon unprotected parts of the body, suffers the 
penalty by sickness, which may vary according to the exposure and the habits 
of the person, which affect the result materially; for what would be an easy 
day's work for a man who is accustomed to hard labor, would be sufficient to 
excite the circulation to such an extent in a person unaccustomed to work, that 
only shght exposure might cause the death of the latter when over-heated in this 
way; while the same exercise and exposure to the man accustomed to hard labor 
might not affect him. So, we say, be careful of your bodies, for it is a duty 
you owe to yom'selves, your friends, and particularly to Him who created you. 
When your body is over-heated and you are perspiring, be very careful about 
sitting down to ' cool off,' as the custom of some is, by removing a part of the 
clothing and sitting in a cool place, and perhaps where there is a draught of air 



HEALTH-SUGGESTIONS. 481 

passing over yoxir body. The proper way to ' cool off ' when over -heated is to 
put on more clothing, especially if you are in a cool place; but never remove a 
part of the clothing you have already on. If possible, get near a fire where 
there is no wind blowing, and dry of gradually, instead of cooling off suddenly, 
which is always dangerous." 

Many colds are taken from the feet being damp or wet. To keep these 
extremities warm and dry is a great preventative against the almost endless hst 
of disorders which come from a " slight cold." Many imagine if their feet are 
not thoroughly wet, there will be no harm arising from mere dampness, not 
knowing that the least dampness is absorbed into the sole, and is attracted nearer 
the foot itself by its heat, and thus perspiration is dangerously checked. 

WATER. 

AH beings need drink as much as they need food, and it is just as necessary to 
health as pure air; therefore the water should be boiled or filtered before being 
drank. Eain- water filtered is probably the best attainable. Boiling the water 
destroys the vegetable and animal matter, and leaves the mineral matter deposited 
on the bottom of the vessel containing it; therefore it leaves it clear from poison- 
ous substances. 

REGULATION IN DIET. 

The food we eat is a very important item, and one which it would be difficult 
to arrange any rule for which would apply to aU persons under different cir- 
CTimstances. In health, it is safer to eat by instinct rather than to follow any 
definite rules. While there are many who have a scanty hving, with a small 
variety of food, there is a large mmiber who have an abimdance and a large 
variety. The former class, in many cases, live miserable Uves, either to hoard 
up for miserly pmT)oses the money which might make them happy, or in some 
cases through poverty; while the latter class, as a rule, have better health and 
have much more enjoyment in this Hfe, unless it be some who are gluttonous, 
and make themselves miserable by abusing the blessings they should enjoy. 
A-Void extremes in hving too free or scanty; have a good nourishing diet, and a 
(Sufficient quantity, and it should always be properly cooked; for if the cooking 
is poorly done, it affects not only the nutritious qualities, but is not so easily 
digested; thus making food, which is originally the best kind, of very httle value 
to us; and with very poor cooking it is sometimes a positive injury. 

It is very important that the food be taken with regularity at the accustomed 
time. Be careful not to take too much drink during any meal; but, if thirsty, 
drink water before meal-time so that you will not care for it until some time 



482 HEALTH-SUGGESTIONS. 

after eating, as it is a bad plan to drink much either during or for a little time 

after the meal is taken. It is a very bad plan to hurry in eating, because by so 

doing the food is not properly masticated; it is better to be a long time in eating 

and chew the food well.

HOW TO USE HOT WATER. 
One of the simplest and most effectual means of relieving pain is by the use 
of hot water, externally and internally, the temperature varying according to 
the feelings of the patient. For bruises, sprains, and similar accidental hini;s, it 
should be appUed immediately, as hot as can be borne, by means of a cloth dipped 
in the water and laid on the wounded part, or by immersion, if convenient, and 
the treatment kept up until relief is obtained. If applied at once, the use of 
hot water will generally prevent, nearly, if not entirely, the bruised flesh from 
turning black. For pains resulting from indigestion, and known as wind coUc, 
etc., a cupful of hot water, taken in sips, will often relieve at once. When that 
is insu ffi cient, a flanael folded ia several thicknesses, large enough to fuUy cover 
the painful place, should be wrung out of hot water and laid over the seat of the 
pain. It should be as hot as the sMn can bear without injury," and be renewed 
every ten minutes or oftener, if it feels cool, imtil the pain is gone. The 
remedy is simple, efl&cient, harmless, and within the reach of every one; and 
should be more generally used than it is. If used along with common sense, it 
might save many a doctor's bill, and many a course of drug treatment as well. 

GROWING PAINS CURED. 

Following in our mother's footsteps, we have been routed night after night 
from our warm quarters, in the dead of winter, to kindle fires and fill frosty kettles 
from water-pails thickly crusted with ice, that we might get the writhing pedal 
extremities of om: little heir into a tub of water as quickly as possible. But' 
lately we have learned that aU this work and exposure is needless. We simply 
wring a towel from salted water — a bowl of it standing in. our sleeping room, 
ready for such an emergency — wrap the limb in it from the ankle to knee, 
without taking the child from his bed, and then swathe with dry flannels, thick 
and warm, tucking the blankets about him a little closer, and relief is sure.

HOW TO KEEP WELL. 

Don't sleep in a draught. 

Don't go to bed with cold feet. 

Don't stand over hot-air registers. 



HEALTH-SUGGESTIONS. . 483 

Don't eat what you do not need, just to save it. 

Don't try to get cool too quickly after exercising. 

Don't sleep in a room without ventilation of some kind. 

Don't stuff a cold lest you should be next obUged to starve a fever. 

Don't sit in a damp or chilly room without a fire. 

Don't try to get along without flannel underclothing in winter. 

DIPHTHERIA. 
A gargle of sulphur and water has been used with much success in cases of 
diphtheria. Let the patient swallow a little of the mixture. Or, when you dis- 
cover that your throat is a httle sore, bind a strip of flannel around the throat, 
wet in camphor, and gargle salt and vinegar occasionally. 

COLDS AND HOARSENESS. 

Borax has proved a most effective remedy in certain forms of colds. In 
sudden hoarseness or loss of voice in public speakers or singers, from colds, relief 
for an hour or so may be obtained by slowly dissolving, and partially swallow- 
ing, a lump of borax the size of a garden pea, or about three or four grains held 
in the mouth for ten or fifteen minutes before speaking or singing. This pro- 
duces a profuse secretion of saliva, or " watering " of the mouth and throat, just 
as wetting brings back the missing notes to a flute when it is too dry. 

A flannel dipped in boiling water, and sprinkled with turpentine, laid on the 
chest as quickly as possible, will relieve the most severe cold or hoarseness. 

Another simple, pleasant remedy is furnished by beating up the white of on© 
egg, adding to it the juice of one lemon, and sweetening with white sugar to 
taste. Take a teaspoonful from time to time. It has been known to effectually 
cure the ailment. 

Or, bake a lemon or sour orange twenty minutes in a moderate oven. When 
done, open at one end and take out the inside. Sweeten with sugar or molasses. 
This is an excellent remedy for hoarseness. 

An old time and good way to reUeve a cold is to go to bed, and stay there, 
drinking nothing, not even water, for twenty-four hours, and eating as little as 
possible. Or, go to bed; put your feet in hot mustard and water; put a bran or 
oatmeal poultice on the chest; take ten grains of Dover's powder, and an hour 
afterwards a pint of hot gruel; in the morning, rub the body all over with a 
coarse towel, and take a dose of aperient medicine. 

Violet, pennyroyal, or boneset tea, is excellent to promote perspiration in 
case of sudden chiU. Care should be taken next day not to get chilled by 
exposure to fresh out-door air.

MOLASSES POSSET. 

This old-fashioned remedy for a cold is as effectual now as it was in old 
times. Put into a sauce-pan a pint of the best West India molasses, a teaspoon- 
ful of powdered white ginger, and a quarter of a pound of fresh butter. Set it 
over the fire, and simmer it slowly for half an hour, stirring it frequently. Do 
not let it come to a boil; Then stir in the juice of two lemons, or two table- 
spoonfuls of vinegar; cover the pan and let it stand by the fire five minutes 
longer. This is good for a cold. Some of it may be taken warm at once, and 
the remainder kept at hand for occasional use. 

It is the preparation absurdly called by the common people a stewed quaker. 

Half a pint of strained honey mixed cold with the juice of a lemon, and a 
tablespoonful of sweet oil, is another remedy for a cold: a teaspoonful or two to 
be taken whenever the cough is troublesome. 

COUGH SYRUP. 

Syrup of squills four ounces, syrup of tolu four ounces, tincture of bloodroot 
one and one-half ounces, camphorated tincture of opium four oimces. Mix. 
Dose for an adult, one teaspoonful repeated every two to four hours, or as often 
as necessary. 

LEANNESS 

Is caused generally by lack of power in the digestive organs to digest and 
assimilate , the fat-producing elements of food. First restore digestion, take 
plenty of sleep, drink aU the water the stomach will bear in the morning on 
rising, take moderate exercise in the open air, eat oatmeal cracked wheat, 
Graham mush, baked sweet apples, roasted and broiled beef; cultivate jolly 
people, and bathe daUy. 

FOR TOOTHACHE. 

The worst toothache, or neuralgia coming from the teeth, may be speedily 
and delightfully ended by the application of a bit of clean cotton, saturated in a 
solution of ammonia, to the defective tooth. Sometimes the late sufferer is 
prompted to momentary laughter by the application, but the pain will disappear. 

Alum reduced to a powder, a teaspoonful of the powder and an equal quan- 
tity of fine salt weU mixed, applied to the gums by dipping your moistened finger 
in the mixed powder; put some also in the tooth, and keep rubbing the gums 
with it; it scarcely ever fails to cure. 



HEALTH-SUGGESTIONS. 485 

TO CURE A STING OF A BEE OR WASP. 
Bind on common baking-soda, dampened with water. Or mix common earth 
with water to about the consistency of mud. 

TO CURE EARACHE. 

Take a bit of cotton batting, put on it a pinch of black pepper, gather it up 
and tie it, dip it in sweet oU, and insert it in the ear; put a flannel bandage over 
the head to keep it warm; it often gives immediate reUef. 

Tobacco smoke, puffed into the ear, has oftentimes been effectual. 

Another remedy: Take equal parts of tmcture of opium and glycerine. Mix, 
and from a warm teaspoon drop two or three drops into the ear, and stop the 
ear tight with cotton, and repeat every hour or two. If matter should form iu 
the ear, make a suds with castile soap and warm water about 100° F., or a httle 
more than milk warm, and have some person inject it into the ear while you 
hold that side of the head the lowest. If it does not heal in due time, inject a 
httle carboUc acid and water in the proportion of one drachm of the acid to on» 
pint of warm water each time after.using the suds. 

CROUP. 

Croup, it is said, can be cured in one minute, and the remedy is simply alimi 
and sugar. Take a knife or grater, and shave off in small particles about a tea- 
spoonful of alum; then mix it with twice its amount of sugar, to make it palata- 
ble, and administer it as quickly as possible. Almost instantaneous rehef wiU 
follow. Turpentine is said to be an excellent remedy for croup. Saturate a 
piece of flannel, and apply it to the chest and throat, and take inwardly three 
or four drops on a lump of sugar. 

Another remedy. — Give a teaspoonful of ipecacuanha wine every few minutes, 
untn free vomiting is excited. 

Another recipe said to be most reUable: Take two ounces of the wine of 
ipecac, hive syrup four ounces, tincture of bloodroot two ounces. Mix it well. 

Dose, for a child one year old, five to ten drops; two years, eight to twelve 
drops; three years, twelve to fifteen drops; fom- years old, fifteen to twenty 
drops; five years old twenty to twenty-five drops, and older children in propor- 
tion to age. Eepeat as often as shall be necessary to procure riehef . If it is 
thought best to produce vomiting, repeat the dose every ten or fifteeji minutes 
for a few doses. 



486 HEALTH-SUGGESTIONS. 

BURNS AND SCALDS. 
A piece of cotton wadding, spread with butter or sweet oil, and bound on the 
bum instantly, wiU draw out the pain without leaving a scar; also a handful of 
flour, bound on instantly, wiU prevent bUstering. The object is to entirely exclude 
the air from the part affected. Some use common baking-soda, dry or wet, 
often giving instant relief, withdrawing the heat and pain. Another valuable 
remedy is to beat the yellow of an egg into Unseed oU, and apply it with a feather 
on the injured part frequently. It will afford ready rehef, and heals with great 
rapidity. Some recommend the white part of the egg, which is very cooling and 
soothing, and soon allays the smarting pain. It is the exposure of the part 
coming in contact with the air that gives the extreme discomfort experienced 
from ordinary afflictions of this kind, and anything which excludes air and pre- 
rents inflammation is the thing to be at once applied. 

TO STOP THE FLOW OF BLOOD. 

For a slight cut there is nothing better to control the hemorrhage than com- 
mon vmglazed brown wrapping paper, such as is used by marketmen and giocers; 
a piece to be bound over the woimd. A handful of floiu* bound on the cut. 
Cobwebs and brown sugar, pressed on like Unt. When the blood ceases to flow, 
apply arnica or laudanum. 

When an artery is cut the red blood spurts out at each pidsation. Press the 
thumb firmly over the artery near the wound, and on the side towards the heart. 
Press hard enough to stop the bleeding, and wait tiU a physician comes. The 
wounded person is often able to do this himself, if he has the requisite knowledge. 

GRAVEL. 

Into a pint of water put two ounces of bicarbonate of soda. Take two table- 
spoonfuls in the early forenoon, and the same towards night; also drink freely 
of water through the day. Inflammation of the kidneys has been successfully 
treated with large doses of Ume- water. 

Persons troubled with kidney difficulties should abstain from sugar and 
things that are converted into sugar in digestion, such as starchy food and sweet 
vegetables. 

SORE THROAT. 

Everybody has a cure for this trouble, but simple remedies appear to be most 
effectual. Salt and water is used by many as a gargle, but a Uttle alum and 
honey dissolved in sage tea is better. An application of cloths wrung out of hot 



HEALTH-SUGGESTIONS. 487 

water and applied to the neck, changing as often as they begin to cool, has the 
most potency for removing inflammation of anything we ever tried. It should 
be kept up for a number of hours; .during the evening is usually the most con- 
venient time for applying this remedy. 

Cut shoes of salt pork or fat bacon, simmer a few moments in hot vinegar, 
and apply to throat as hot as possible. When this is taken off, as the throat is 
relieved, put aroimd a bandage of soft flannel. A gargle of equal parts of borax 
and alum, dissolved in water, is also excellent. To be used frequently. 

Camphorated oil is an excellent lotion for sore throat, sore chest, aching 
limbs, etc. For a gargle for sore throat, put a pinch of chlorate of potash in a 
glass of water. Gargle the throat with it twice a day, or oftener, if necessary. 

WHOOPING COUGH. 

Two level tablespoonfuls of powdered alum; two-thirds of a cupful of brown 
sugar, dissolved in two quarts of water; bottle and put in a dark closet where it 
is cool. 

For a child one year old, a teaspoonf ul three times a day on an empty stomach. 
For a child two years old, two teaspoonfuls for a dose. For a child five years 
old, a tablespoonful. The state of the bowels must be attended to, and the dosea 
repeated accordingly. No other medicine to be taken, except an emetic, at first, 
if desirable. Except in the case of an infant, a milk diet is to be avoided. 

DIARRHOEA. 
Take tincture of Jamaica ginger one ounce, tincture of rhubarb one ounce, 
tincture of opium half ounce, tincture of cardamom one and one-half ounces, 
tinctiue of kino one ounce. Mix. Dose for an adult, half to one teaspoonful, 
repeated every two to four hours; and for chfldren one year old, five drops; 
two years old, five to ten drops; three years old, ten to twelve drops, and older 
children in proportion to age. 

FOR CONSTIPATION. 

One or two figs eaten fasting is sufficient for some, and they are especially good 
in the case of children, as there is no trouble in getting them to take them. A 
spoonful of wheaten bran in a glass of water is a simple remedy, and quite 
effective, taken half an hour before breakfast; fruit eaten raw; partake largely of 
laxative food; exercise in the open air; drink freely of cold water during the day, 
etc. It is impossible to give many of the numerous treatments in so short a 
spaoe, suffice it to say that the general character of our diet and experience ig 



HEALTH-SUGGESTIONS. 

such as to assure us that at least one-quarter of the food that we swallow is 
intended by nature to be evacuated from the system; and if it is not, it is again 
absorbed into the system, poisoning the blood and producing much suffering and 
permanent disease. The evacuation of the bowels daily, and above aU, regularly y 
w therefore aU important to aid this form of disorder. 

RELIEF FROM ASTHMA. 

Sufferers from asthma should get a muskrat skin and wear it over their lungs, 
with the fur side next to the body. It will bring certain reUef. 

Or, soak blotting-paper in saltpetre water, then dry, burning at night in 
the patient's bedroom. 

Another excellent recipe : Take powdered hquorice root, powdered elecampane 
root, powdered anise-seed, each one drachm, powdered ipecac ten grains, powder- 
ed lobelia ten grains; add sufficient amount of tar to form into pills of ordinary 
size. Take three or four piUs on going to bed at night. An excellent remedy 
for asthma or shortness of breath. 

RECIPES FOR FELONS. 

Take common rock salt, as used for salting down pork or beef, dry in an 
oven, then pound it fine and mix with spirits of turpentine in equal parts; put 
it in a rag and wrap it around the parts affected; as it gets dry put on more, and 
in twenty-four hours you are cured. The felon will be dead. 

Or purchase the herb of stramonium at the druggist's; steep it and bind it 
on the felon; as soon as cold, put on new, warm herbs. It wiU soon kill it, in a 
few hours at least. 

Or saturate a bit oi grated wUd turnip, the size of a bean, with spirits of 
turpentine, and apply it to the affected part. It relieves the pain at once; in 
twelve horns there will be a hole to the bone, and the felon destroyed; then 
apply heaUng salve, and the finger is well. 

Another way to cure a Felon : Fill a tumbler with equal parts of fine salt and 
ice; mix well. Sink the finger in the centre, allow it to remain until it is nearly 
frozen and numb; then withdraw it, and when sensation is restored, renew the 
operation four or five times, when it will be found the disease is destroyed. 
This must be done before pus is formed. 

A simple remedy for felons, relieving pain at once, no poulticing, no cutting, 
no " holes to the bone," no necessity for healing salve, but simple oil of cedar 
applied a few times at the commencement of the felon, and the work is done.

REMEDY FOR LOCKJAW. 

K any person is threatened or taken with lockjaw from injuries of the arms, 
legs or feet, do not wait for a doctor, but put the part injured in the following 
preparation: Put hot wood-ashes into water as warm as can be borne; if the 
injured part cannot be put into water, then wet thick folded cloths in the water 
and apply them to the part as soon as possible, at the same time bathe the back- 
bone from the neck down with some laxative stimulant — say cayenne pepper 
and water, or mustard and water (good vinegar is better than water); it should 
be as hot as the patient can bear it. Don't hesitate; go to work and do it, and 
don't stop imtil the jaws will come open. No person need die of lockjaw if these 
directions are followed. 

Cure for Lockjaw, said to he positive. — Let any one who has an attack of 
lockjaw take a small quantity of spirits of turpentine, warm it, and pom* it in 
the wound — no matter where the wound is or what its nature is — ^and relief wiU 
follow in less than one minute. Turpentine is also a sovereign remedy for croup. 
Saturate a piece of flannel with it, and place the flannel on the throat and chest 
— ^and in very severe cases, three to five drops on a lump of sugar may be taken 
internally. 

BLEEDING AT THE NOSE. 
Eoll up a piece of paper and press it under the upper hp. In obstinate cases, 
blow a Uttle gum arable up the nostril through a quiU, which will immediately 
stop the discharge; powdered alum, dissolved in water, is also good. Pressure 
by the finger over the small artery near the ala (wing) of the nose, on the side 
where the blood is flowing, is said to arrest the hemorrhage immediately. Some- 
times by wringing a cloth out of very hot water, and laying it on the back of 
the neck, gives relief. Napkins wrung out of cold water must be laid across the 
forehead and nose, the hands dipped in cold water, and a bottle of hot water 
apphed to the feet. 

TO TAKE CINDERS FROM THE EYE. 

In most cases a simple and effective cure may be found in one or two grains 
of flax-seed, which can be placed in the eye without pain or injury. As they 
dissolve, a glutinous substance is formed, which envelops any foreign body that 
may be vmder the lid, and the whole is easily washed out. A dozen of these 
seeds should constitute a part of every traveller's outfit. 

Another remedy for removing objects from the eye: Take a horsehair and 
double it, leaving a loop. If the object can be seen, lay the loop over it, close 



490 HEALTH-SUGGESTIONS. 

the eye, and the mote will come out as the hair is withdrawn. If the irritating 
object cannot be seen, raise the Ud of the eye as high as possible and place the 
loop as far as you can, close the eye and roll the ball around a few times, draw 
out the hair, and the substance which caused the pain will be sure to come with 
it. This method is practiced by axemakeiss and other workers in steel 

— Montreal Star. 

EYE-WASHES. 

The best eye-wash for granulated lids and inflammation of the eyes is com- 
posed of camphor, borax and morphine, in the following proportions: To a large 
wine-glass of camphor water — not spirits — add two grains of morphine and six 
grains of borax. Pour a few drops into the palm of the hand, and hold the eye 
in it, opening the lid as much as possible. Do this three or four times in 
twenty-four hoiu«, and you will receive great rehef from pain and smarting 
soreness. This recipe was received from a celebrated oculist, and has never 
failed to relieve the most inflamed eyes. 

Another remedy said to be reliable: A lump of alum as large as a cranberry 
boiled in a teacupful of sweet milk, and the curd used as a poultice, is excellent 
for inflammation of the eyes. 

Another wash : A cent's worth of pure, refined white copperas, dissolved im 
a pint of water, is also a good lotion; but label it poison, as it should never 
go near the mouth. Bathe the eyes with the mixture, either with the hands or 
a small piece of linen cloth, allowing some of the liquid to get under the lids. 

Here is another from an eminent oculist : Take half an ounce of rock salt and 
one ounce of dry sulphate of zinc ; simmer in a clean, covered porcelain vessel 
with three pints of water until all are dissolved; strain through thick muslin; 
add one ounce of rose-water; bottle and cork it tight. To use it, mix one tea- 
spoonful of rain-water with one of the eye- water, and bathe the eyes frequent- 
ly. If it smarts too much, add more water. 

SUNSTROKE. 
Wrap a wet cloth bandage over the head; wet another cloth, folded smalt, 
square, cover it thickly with salt, and bind it on to the back of the neck; apply 
dry salt behind the ears. Put mustard plasters to the calves of the legs and 
Boles of the feet. This is an effectual remedv. 

TO REMOVE WARTS. 
IVash with water saturated with common washing-soda, and let it dry with 
But wiping; repeat frequently imtil they disappear. Or pass a pin through the 



HEALTH-SUGGESTIONS. 49I 

waxt and hold one end of it over the flame of a candle or lamp until the wart 
fires by the heat, and it will disappear. 

'Another treatment of warts is to pare the hard and dry skin from their tops, 
and then touch them with the smallest drop of strong acetic acid, taking care 
that the acid does not run off the wart upon the neighboring skia; for if it does, 
it win occasion inflammation and much pain. If this is continued once or twice 
daily, with regularity, paring the surface of the wart occasionally when it gets 
hard and dry, the wart wiU be soon effectually cured. 

SWAIM'S VERMIFUGE. 

Worm seed, two ounces; valerian, rhubarb, pink root, white agaric, senna, 
of each one ounce and a half. BoU in sufficient water to yield three quarts of 
decoction. Now add to it ten drops of the oil of tansy and forty-five drops of 
the oU of cloves, dissolved in a quart of rectified spirit. Dose: one tablespoonful 
at night. 

FAINTING. (Syncope.) 

Immediately place the person fainting in a lying position, with head lower 
than body. In this way consciousness returns immediately, whUe in the erect 
position it often ends in death. 

FOR SEVERE SPRAINS. 

The white of an egg, a tablespoonful of vinegar and a tablespoonful of spirits 
of turpentine. Mix in a bottle, shake thoroughly, and bathe the sprain as soon 
as possible after the accident. This was pubhshed in Life Secrets, but it is 
repubhshed by request on account of its great value. It should be remembered 
by every one. 

An invaluable remedy for a sprain or bruise is wormwood boiled in vinegar 
and applied hot, with enough cloths wrapped around it to keep the sprain moist. 

CAMPHORATED OIL. 

Best oil of Lucca; gum camphor. Pound some gum camphor and fill a wide- 
necked pint bottle one-third fuU; fill up with ohve oil, and set away until the 
camphor is absorbed. Excellent lotion for sore chest, sore throat, aching Umbs, 
etc. 

LINIMENT FOR CHILBLAINS. 

Spirits of turpentine, three drachms; camphorated oil, nine drachms. 

Mix for a liniment. For an adiilt four drachms of the former and eight of 
fche latter may be used. If the child be young, or if the skin be tender, the 
campnorated oil may be used without the turpentine.

"THE SUN'S" CHOLERA MIXTURE. 

More than forty years ago, when it was found that prevention for the Asiatic 
cholera was easier than cure, the learned doctors of both hemispheres drew up 
a prescription, which was published (for working people) in Thb New York Sun, 
and took the name of " The Sun Cholera Mixture." It is found to be the best 
remedy for looseness of the bowels ever yet devised. It is to be commended for 
several reasons. It is not to be mixed with hquor, and therefore wOl not be used 
as an alcohoHc beverage. Its ingredients are well known among aU the common 
people, and it will have no prejudice to combat; each of the materials is in equal 
proportions to the others, and it may therefore be compounded without pro- 
fessional skill; and as the dose is so very small, it may be carried in a tiny phial 
in the waistcoat pocket, and be always at hand. It is: 

Take equal parts of tincture of cayenne, tincture of opium, tincture of rhu- 
barb, essence of peppermint, and spirits of camphor. Mix weU. Dose fifteen 
to thirty drops in a wine-glass of water, according to age and violence of the 
attack. Eepeat every fifteen or twenty minutes until rehef is obtained. No one 
who tafces it in time wiU ever have the cholera. Even when no cholera is antici- 
pated, it is a valuable remedy for ordinary summer complaints, and should 
always be kept ia readiness. 

COMP. CATHARTIC ELIXIR. 

The only pleasant and reUable cathartic in liquid form that can be prescribed. 

Each fluid ounce contains: sulph. magnesia one dr., senna two drs., scam- 
mony six grs., liquorice one dr., giagerthree grs., coriander, fivegrs., with flavor- 
ing ingredients. 

Dose. — Child flve years old, one or two teaspoonfuls; adult, one or two table- 
spoonfuls. 

This preparation is being used extensively throughout the comitry. It was 
originated with the design of furnishing a hquid cathartic remedy that could be 
prescribed in a palatable form. It wiU be taken by children with a relish. 

GRANDMOTHER'S COUGH SYRUP. 

Take half a pound of dry hoarhound herbs, one pod of red pepper, four table- 
spoonfuls of ginger, boil all in three quarts of water, then strain; and add one 
teaspoonful of good, fresh tar and a pound of sugar. Boil slowly and stir otten, 
uutU it is reduced to one quart of syrup. When cool, bottle for use. laKe one 
«r two teaspoonfuls four or six times a day.

GRANDMOTHER'S UNIVERSAL LINIMENT. 

One pint of alcohol, and as much camphor gum as can be dissolved in it, half 
an ounce of the oil of cedar, one-half oimce of the oil of sassafras, aqua ammo- 
nia, half an ounce, and the same amount of the tincture of morphine. Shake 
well together, and apply by the fire; the Kniment must not be heated^ or come 
in contact with the fire, but the rubbing to be done by the warmth of the fire. 

These recipes of Grandmother's are all old, tried medicLries, and are more 
effectual than most of those that are advertised, as they have been thoKOughly 
tried, and proved rehable. 

GRANDMOTHER'S FAMILY SPRING BITTERS. 

Mandrake root, one ounce; dandeUon root, one ounce; burdock root, one 
ovmce; yellow dock root, one ounce; prickly ash berries, two ounces; marsh mal- 
low, one ounce; turkey rhubarb, half an ounce; gentian, one ounce; EngUsh 
camomile flowers, one ounce; red clover tops, two ounces. 

Wash the herbs and roots; put them into an earthen vessel, pour over two 
quarts of water that has been boiled and cooled; let it stand over night and soak; 
in the morning, set it on the back of the stove, and steep it five hours; it must 
not boil, but nearly ready to boU. Strain it through a cloth, and add half a pint 
of good gin. Keep it in a cool place. Half a wine-glass taken as a dose twice 
a day. 

This is better than aU the patent blood-medicines that are in the market — a 
superior blood purifier, and wiU cure almost any malignant sore, by taking 
according to direction, and washing the sore with a strong tea of red raspberry 
leaves steeped, first washing the sore with castile soap, then drying with a soft 
cloth, and washing it with the strong tea of red raspberry leaves. 

GRANDMOTHER'S EYE-WASH. 

Take three fresh eggs, and break them into one quart of clear, cold rain- 
water; stir until thoroughly mixed; bring to a boU on a slow fira, stirring often; 
then add half an ounce of sulphate of zinc (white vitriol); continue the boiling 
for two minutes, then set it off the fire. Take the curd that settles at the 
bottom of this and apply to the eye at night with a bandage. It wiU speedily 
draw out all fever and soreness. Strain the liquid through a cloth and use for 
bathing the eyes occasionally. This is the best eye- water ever made fc*' man 
or beast. I have used it for twenty years without knowing it to faU.

HUNTER'S PILLS. 

These pills can be manufactured at home, and are truly reliable,, having been 
sold and used for more than fifty years in Europe. The ingredients may be pro- 
cured at almost any druggist's. The articles should be all in the powder. Saffron, 
one grain; rue, one grain; Scot aloes, two grains; savin one grain; cayenne 
pepper, one grain : Mix all into a very thick mass by adding suflftcient syrup. 
Eub some fine starch on the surface of a platter or large dinner-plate, then vnth 
your forefinger and thumb nip off a small piece of the mass the size of a pUl and 
roll it in pill form, first dipping your fingers in the starch. Place them as fast 
as made on the platter, set where they will dry slowly. Put them into a dry 
bottle or paper box. Dose, one every night and morning as long as occasion 
requires. 

This recipe is worth ten times the price of this book to any female requiring 
the need of these regulating pills. 

HINTS IN REGARD TO HEALTH. 

It is plainly seen by an inquiring mind that, aside from the selection and 
preparation of food, there are many little things constantly arising in the experi- 
ence of every-day hfe which, in their combined effect, are powerful agents in 
the formation (or prevention) of perfect health. A careful observance of these 
little occun-ences, an inquiry into the philosophy attending them, Ues within the 
province, and indeed should be considered among the highest duties, of every 
housekeeper. 

That one should be cautious about entering a sick room in a state of perspira- 
tion, as the moment you become cool your pores absorb. Do not approach con- 
tagious diseases with an empty stomach, nor sit between the sick and the fire, 
because the heat attracts the vapor. 

That the flavor of cod-liver oil may be changed to the delightful one of fresh 
oyster, if the patient wiU drink a large glass of water poured from a vessel in 
which nails have been allowed to rust. 

That a b:Lg of hot sand reheves neuralgia. 

That warm borax water will remove dandruff. 

That salt should be eaten with nuts to aid digestion. 

That it rests you, in sewing, to change your position frequently. 

That a httle soda water vsdU reheve sick headache caused by indigestion. 

That a cupful of strong coffee will remove the odor of onions from the breath. 

That weU- ventilated bedrooms will prevent morning headaches and lassitude. 

A cupful of hot water drank before meals wiU relieve nausea and dyspepsia. 



HEALTH-SUGGESTIONS. 495 

That a fever patient can be made cool and comfortable by frequent sponging 
©flf with soda water. 

That consumptive night-sweats may be arrested by sponging the body nightly 
in salt water. 

That one in a faint should be laid flat on his back, then loosen his clothes and 
let him alono. 

The best time to bathe is just before going to bed, as any danger of taking 
cold is thus avoided; and the complexion is improved by keeping warm for 
several hours after leaving the bath. 

To beat the whites of eggs quickly add a piach of salt. Salt cools, and cold 
eggs froth rapidly. 

Hot, dry flannels, applied as hot as possible, for neuralgia. 

Spraios and bruises call for an application of the tincture of arnica. 

If an artery is severed, tie a small cord or handkerchief above it. 

For bflious colic, soda and ginger in hot water. It may be taken freely. 

Tickling in the throat is best reUeved by a gargling of salt and water. 

Pains in the side are most promptly relieved by the apphcation of mustard. 

For cold in the head, nothing is better than powdered borax, sniffed up the 
nostrils. 

A drink of hot, strong lemonade before going to bed wiU often break up a 
cold and cure a sore throat. 

Nervous spasms are usually relieved by a Uttle salt taken into the mouth and 
allowed to dissolve. 

Whooping-cough paroxysms are relieved by breathing the fumes of turpen- 
tine and carbolic acid. 

Broken hmbs should be placed in natm-al positions, and the patient kept quiet 
until the surgeon arrives. 

Hemorrhages of the lungs or stomach are promptly checked by small doses 
of salt. The patient should be kept as quiet as possible. 

Sleeplessness caused by too much blood in the head may be overcome by 
applying a cloth wet with cold water to the back of the neck. 

Wind coUc is promptly reUeved by peppermint essence, taken in a little warm 
water. For small children it may be sweetened. Paregoric is also good. 

For stomach cramps, ginger ale or a teaspoonf ul of the tincture of ginger 
in a half glass of water in which a half teaspoonful of soda has been dissolved. 

Sickness of the stomach is most promptly relieved by drinking a teacupful of 
hot soda and water. If it brings the offending matter up, all the better. 

A teaspoonful of gr«und mustard in a cupful of warm water is a promi^t nud 



496 HEALTH-SUGGESTIONS. 

reliable emetic, and should be resorted to in cases of poisoning or cramps in the 
Btomaxjh from over-eating. 

Avoid purgatives or strong physic, as they not only do no good, but are posi- 
tively hurtful. Pills may reUeve for the time, but they seldom cure. 

Powdered rosin is the best thing to stop bleeding from cuts. After the pow- 
der is sprinkled on, wrap the wound with soft cotton cloth. As soon as the 
wound begins to feel feverish, keep the cloth wet with cold water. 

Eggs are considered one of the best remedies for dysentery. Beaten up slight- 
ly, with or without sugar, and swallowed, they tend by their emollient quaU- 
ties to lessen the inflammation of the stomach and intestines, and by forming 
a transient coating on those organs, enable Nature to resume her healthful 
sway over the diseased body. Two, or at most, three, eggs per day, would be 
all that is required in ordinary cases; and, since the egg is not merely medicine, 
but food as well, the lighter the diet otherwise, and the quieter the patient is 
kept, the more certain and rapid is the recovery. 

Hot water is better than cold for bruises. It relieves pain quickly, and by 
preventing cong^tion often keeps off the ugly black and blue mark. " Children 
cry for it," when they experience the rehef it affords their bumps and bruises. 

For a sprained ankle, the white of eggs and powdered alum made into a 
plaster is almost a specific. 

MEDICINAL FOOD. 

Spinach has a direct effect upon complaints of the kidneys; the common 
dandeHon, used as greens, is excellent for the same trouble; asparagus purifies 
the blood; celery acts admirably upon the nervous system, and is a cure for 
rheumatism and neuralgia; tomatoes act upon the liver; beets and turnips are 
excellent appetizers; lettuce and cucumbers are cooling in their effects upon the 
system; beans are a very nutritious and strengthening vegetable; while onions, 
garlic, leeks, chives and shalots, aU of which are similar, possess medical vir- 
tues of a marked character, stimulating the circulatory system, and the con- 
sequent increase of the saliva and the gastric juice promoting digestion. Eed 
onions are an excellent diuretic, and the white ones are recommended raw as 
a remedy for insomnia. They are tonic, nutritious. A soup made from onions 
is regarded by the French as an excellent restorative in debility of the digestive 
organs. "We might go through the entire list and find each vegetable possessing 
itjs especial mission of cure, and it will be plain to every housekeeper that a 
vegetable diet should be partly adopted, and will prove of great advantage to 
»ne health of the family

USES OF AMMONIA. 

All housekeepers should keep a bottle of hquid ammoma, as it is the most 
powerfiil and useful agent for cleaning silks, stuffs and hats, in fact cleans 
everything it touches, A few drops of ammonia in water will take off grease 
from dishes, pans, etc., does not injure the hands as much as the use of soda 
and strong chemical soaps. A spoonful in a quart of warm water for cleaning 
paint, makes it look Kke new, and so with everything that needs cleaning. 

Spots on towels and hosiery will disappear with little trouble if a httle 
ammonia is put into enough water to soak the articles, and they are left in it 
an hour or two before washing; and if a cupful is put into the water in which 
clothes are soaked the night before washing, the ease with which the articles 
can be washed, and their great whiteness and clearness when dried, will be very 
gratifying. Eemembering the small sum paid for three quarts of ammonia 
of common strength, one can easily see that no bleaching preparation can be 
more cheaply obtained. 

No articles in kitchen use are so likely to be neglected and abused as the dish- 
cloths and dish-towels; and in washing these, ammonia, if properly used, is a 
greater comfort than anywhere else. Put a teaspoonful into the water in which 
these clothes are, or should be washed every day; rub soap on the towels. Put 
them in the water; let them stand half an hour or so; then rub them out 
thoroughly, rinse faithfully, and dry out-doors in clear air and* sun, and dish- 
cloths and towels need never look gray and dingy — a perpetual discomfort to 
aU housekeepers. 

A dark carpet often looks dusty soon after it has been swept, and you 
know it does not need sweeping again; so wet a cloth or a sponge, wring it 
almost dry, and wipe off the dust. A few drops of ammoma in the water will 
brighten the colors

For cleaning hair-brushes it is excellent; put a tablespoonful into the water, 
having it only tepid, and dip up and down until clean; then dry with the brushes 
down, and they will be like new ones. 

When employed in washing anything that is not especially soiled, use the 
waste water afterward for the house plants that are taken down from their us- 
ual position and immersed in the tub of water. Ammonia is a fertiUzer, and 
helps to keep healthy the plants it nourishes. In every way, in fact, ammonia 
is the housekeeper's friend. 

Ammonia is not only useful for cleaning, but as a household medicine. Half 
a teaspoonful taken in half a tumbler of water is far better for faintness than al- 
coholic stimulants. In the Temperance Hospital, in London, it is used with 
the best results. It was used freely by Lieutenant Greely's Artie party for keep- 
ing up circulation. It is a relief iu nervousness, headache, and heart disturb- 
ances. 

TO DESTROY INSECTS AND VERMIN. 

Dissolve two pounds of alum in three or four quarts of water. Let it remain 
over night, tUl aU the alum is dissolved. Then, with a brush, apply, boiling hot, 
to every joint or crevice in the closet or shelves where croton bugs, ants, cock- 
roaches, etc., intrude; also to the joints and crevices of bedsteads, as bed bugs 
dislike it as much as croton bugs, roaches, or ants. Brush all the cracks in the 
floor and mopboards. Keep it boUing hot while using. 

To keep woolens and furs from moths, be sure that none are in the articles 
when they are put away; then take a piece of strong brown paper, with not a 
hole through which even a pin can enter. Put the article in it, with several 
lumps of gum camphor between the folds. Place this in a close box or trunk. 
Cover every joint with paper. A piece of cotton cloth, if thick and firm, wiU 
answer. Wherever a knitting-needle can pass, the parent moth can enter. 

Place pieces of camphor, cedar-wood, Eussia leather, tobacco-leaves, whole 
cloves, or anything strongly aromatic, in the drawers or boxes where furs and 
other things to be preserved from moths are kept, and they will never be harmed. 
Mice never get into drawers or trunks where gum camphor is placed. 

Another recipe:— Mix half a pint of alcohol, the saime quantity of turpentine, 
and two oimces of camphor. Keep in a stone bottle, and shake well before us- 
ing. The clothes or furs are to be wrapped in linen, and crumbled-up pieces of 
blotting-paper dipped in the liquid to be placed in the box with them, so that it 
smells strong. This requires renewing but once a year. 

Another authority says that a positive, sure recipe is this: Mix equal quan-

titles of pulverized borax, camphor gum and saltpetre together, making a pOW' 
der. Sprinkle it dry mider the edges Of carpets, in drawers, trmiks, etc., etc, 
It win also keep out aU kinds of insects, if plentifully used. If the house- 
keeper will begin at the top of her house with a powder bellows and a large quan- 
tity of this fresh powder, and puff it thoroughly into every crack and crevice, 
whether or not there are croton bugs in them, to the very bottom of her house, 
special attention being paid to old furniture, closets, and wherever croton wafcei 
is introduced, she will be freed from these torments. The operation may re- 
quire a repetition, but the end is success. 

MOTHS IN CARPETS. 

If ycd fear that they are at work at the edge of the carpet, it wiU sometimes 
suffice to lay a wet towel, and press a hot flat-iron over it; but the best way is to 
take the carpet up, and clean it, and give a good deal of attention to the floor. 
Look in the cracks, and if you discover signs of moths, wash the floor with ben- 
zine, and scatter red pepper on it before putting the carpet lining down. 

Heavy carpets sometimes do not require taking up every year, unless in con- 
stant use. Take out the tacks from these, fold the carpets back, wash the floor 
in strong suds with a tablespoonful of borax dissolved in them. Dash with in- 
sect powder, or lay with tobacco leaves along the edge, and retack. Or use tur- 
pentine, the enemy of buffalo moths, carpet worms and other insects that injure 
and destroy carpets. Mix the turpentine with pure water in the proportion of 
three tablespoonfuls to three quarts of water, and then after the carpet has been 
weU swept, go over each breadth carefully with a sponge dipped in the solution 
and wrung nearly dry. Change the water as often as it becomes dirty. The 
carpet wiU be nicely cleaned as weU as disinfected. AU moths can be kept away 
and the eggs destroyed by this means. Spots may be renovated by the use of 
ox-gaU or ammonia and water. 

A good way to brighten a carpet is to put a half tmnbler of spirits of turpen- 
tine in a basin of water, and dip yom* broom in it and sweep over the carpet 
once or twice, and it wiU restore the color and brighten it up until you would 
think it new. Another good way to clean old carpets is to rub them over with 
meal; just dampen it a very httle and rub the carpet with it, and when perfectly 
dry, sweep over with meal. After a carpet is thoroughly swept, rub it with a 
cloth dipped in water and ammonia: it wiU brighten the colors and make it look 
like new. 

TO TAKE OUT MACHINE GREASE. 

Cold water, a tablespoonful of ammonia, and soap, wiU take out machine 
grease where othef means would not answer on account of colors running, etc.

TO WASH FLANNELS. 

The first thing to consider in washing flannels so that they retain their size, 
is, that the article be washed and rinsed in water of the same temperature, that 
is, about as warm as the hands can bear, and not allowed to cool between. The 
water should be a strong suds. Eub through two soapy waters; wring them 
out, and put into plenty of clear, clean, warm water to rinse. Then into another 
of the same temperature, blued a little. Wring, shake them well, and hang up. 
Do not take out of this warm water and hang out in a freezing air, as that cer- 
tainly tends to shrink them. It is better to dry them in the house, unless the 
sun shines. They should dry quickly. Colored flannels should never be washed 
in the same water after white clothes, or they will be covered, when dry, 
with liut; better be washed in a water for themselves. In washing worsted, 
such as merino dress goods, pursue the same course, only do not wring them 
hard; shake, hang them up and let drain. While a httle damp, bring in and 
press smoothly on the wrong side with as hot an iron as can be used without 
scorching the goods. 

Flannels that have become yellow from being badly washed, may be nicely 
whitened by soaking them two or three hours in a lather made of one-quarter 
of a pound of soft soap, two tablespoonfvils of powdered borax, and two table- 
spoonfuls of carbonate of ammonia, dissolved in five or six gallons of water. 

TO STARCH, FOLD AND IRON SHIRTS. 

To three tablespoonfuls of dry, fine starch allow a quart of water. First wet 
the starch smooth in a httle cold water in a tin pan, put into it a httle pinch of 
salt and a piece of enamel, or shirt pohsh, the size of a bean, or a piece of 
clean tallow, or a piece of butter the size of a cranberry; pour over this a quart 
of boiling water, stirring rapidly, placing it over the fire. Cook until clear, then 
remove it from the fire and set the pan in another of warm water to keep the 
starch warm. 

Turn the shirt wrong side out and dip the bosom in the hot starch as warm 
as the hands can bear the heat; rub the starch evenly through the Unen, saturat- 
ing it thoroughly; wring hard to make dry as possible. Starch the collar and 
wristbands the same way; then hang them out to dry. Three hours before iron- 
ing them, wet the bosoms and cuffs in cold water, wring out, shake and fold, 
roU up tightly, wrap in a towel and let remain two or three hours. 

The back of the shirt should be ironed first by doubhng it lengthwise througi^ 
the centre, the wristbands may be ironed next, and both sides of the sleeves; 



502 MISCELLANEOUS RECIPES. 

then the collar band; now place a bosom board under the bosom and with a fresh 
clean napkin dampened a httle, rub the bosom from the top towards the bottom, 
arranging and smoothing each plait neatly; then with a smooth, moderately hot 
flat-iron, begin ironing from the top downward, pressing hard until the bosom 
becomes smooth dry and glossy. Eemove the bosom board and iron the front, 
fold both sides of the shirt towards the centre of the back, fold together below 
the bosom and hang on the bars to air. 

CLEANING OIL-CLOTHS. 

A dingy oU-cloth may be brightened by washing it with clear water with a 
little borax dissolved in it; wipe it with a flannel cloth that you have dipped into 
milk, and then wring as dry as possible. 

TO CLEAN BLACK LACE. No. i. 

A teaspoonful of gum arabic, dissolved in one teacupful of boiling water; 
when cool, add half a teaspoonful of black ink; dip the lace and spread smoothly 
between the folds of a newspaper and press dry with book or the like. Lace shawls 
can be dressed over in this way, by pinning a sheet to the carpet, and stretch- 
ing the shawl upon that; or black lace can be cleaned the same as ribbon and 
silk. Take an old kid glove (black preferable), no matter how old, and boil it in 
a pint of water for a short time; then let it cool imtil the leather can be taken in 
the hand without burning; use the glove to sponge off the ribbon; if the ribbon 
is very dirty, dip it into water and draw through the fingers a few times before 
sponging. After cleaning, lay a piece of paper over the ribbon, and iron; paper 
is better than cloth. The ribbon will look Uke new. 

TO CLEAN BLACK LACE. No. 2. 

Black laces of all kinds may be cleaned by alcohol. Throw them boldly into 
the liquid; churn them up and down till they foam; if very dusty, use the second 
dose of alcohol; squeeze them out, " spat " them, piill out the edges, lay them 
between brown paper, smooth and straight; leave under a heavy weight tUI dry; 
do not iron. 

TO WASH WHITE LACE. No. i. 

First, the soiled laces should be carefully removed from the garment and 
folded a number of times, keeping the edges evenly together, then basted with 
a coarse thread without a knot in the end. Now put them in a basin of luke- 
warm suds. After soaking a half hour, rub them carefully between the hands, 
renewing the suds several times; then, after soaping them well, place them in 



MISCELLANEOUS RECIPES. 503 

zold water and let them come to a scald. Take them from this and rinse them 
thoroughly in luke-warm water, blued a very Uttle, then dip them into a very 
thin, clear starch, allowing a teaspoonf ul of starch to a pint of water, so thin 
that it will be scarcely perceptible. Now roll them in a clean, fresh towel without 
taking out the bastings; let them he for an hour or more; iron over several thick- 
nesses of flannel, taking out the bastings of one piece at a time, and ironing on 
the wrong side, with a moderately hot iron; the laces should be nearly dry, and 
the edges and points puUed gently with the fingers into shape, before ironing. 

TO WASH WHITE THREAD LACE. No. 2. 

To wash white lace, cover a bottle with linen, stitched smoothly to fit the 
shape. Wind the lace about it, basting both edges to the hnen Wash on the 
bottle, soaping and rinsing well, then boil in soft water. Dry in the sun. CUp 
the basting threads and do not iron. If carefully done, it wiU look hke new 
lace. 

TO CLEAN SILKS OR RIBBONS. 

Half a pint of gin, half a pound of honey, half a pound of soft soap, one- 
eighth of a pint of water. 

Mix the above ingredients together; then lay each breadth of sflk upon a 
clean kitchen table or dresser, and scrub it well on the soiled side with the mix- 
ture. Have ready three vessels of cold water; take each piece of silk at two 
comers, and dip it up and down in each vessel, but do not wring it; and take 
care that each breadth has one vessel of quite clean water for the last dip. Hang 
it up dripping for a minute or two, then dab in a cloth, and iron it quickly with 
a very hot iron. 

Where the lace or silk is very much soiled, it is best to pass them through a 
warm Uquor of bullock's gall and water; rinse in cold water; then take a smaU 
piece of glue, pour boiUng water on it, and pass the veil through it; clap it, and 
frame to dry. Instead of framing, it may be fastened with drawing-pins closely 
fixed upon a very clean paste, or drawing-board. 

TO CLEAN BLACK DRESS SILKS. 

One of the things "not generally known," at least in this country, is the 
Parisian method of cleaning black silk; the modus operandi is very simple, and 
the result infinitely superior to that achieved in any other manner. The silk 
must be thoroughly brushed and wiped with a cloth, then laid fiat on a board or 
table, and well-sponged with hot coffee, thoroughly freed from sediment by be- 
ing, strained through muslin. The silk is sponged on the side intended to showj 



5*^4 MISCELLANEOUS RECIPES. 

ft is allowed to become partially dry, and then ironed on the wrong side. The 
coffee removes every particle of grease, and restores the brilliancy of sOk, with- 
out imparting to it either the shiny appearance or crackly and papery stiffness 
obtained by beer, or, indeed, any other liquid. The silk really appears thickened 
by the process, and this good effect is permanent. Our readers who will experi- 
mentalize on an apron or cravat, will never agaiu try any other method. 

TO WASH FEATHERS. 

"Wash in warm soap-suds and rinse iu water a very httle blued; if the feather 
is white, then let the wind dry it. When the curl has come out by washing the 
feather or getting it damp, place a hot flat-iron so that you can hold the feather 
just above it while curhng. Take a bone or silver knife, and draw the fibres of the 
feather between the thumb and the dull edge of the knife, taking not more than 
three fibres at a time, beginning at the point of the feather and curling one-half 
the other way. The hot iron makes the curl more durable. After a Httle prac- 
tice one can make them look as well as new feathers. Or they can be curled by 
holding them over the stove or range, not near enough to biu-n; withdraw, and 
shake out; then hold them over again, untU they ciu-l. When swansdown be- 
comes soiled, it can be washed and look as well as new. Tack strips on a piece 
of musUn and wash in warm water with white soap, then rinse and hang in the 
wind to dry. Eip from the muslin, and rub carefully between the fingers to 
soften the leather. 

INCOMBUSTIBLE DRESSES. 

By putting an ounce of alum or sal ammoniac in the last water in which 
muslins or cottons are rinsed, or a similar quantity in the starch in which they 
are stiffened, they will be rendered almost uninflammable; or, at least, wiU with 
difficulty take the fire, and if they do, will bum vnthout flame. It is astonish- 
ing that this simple precaution is so rarely adopted. Eemember this and save 
the hves of your children. 

HOW TO FRESHEN UP FURS. 

Furs when taken out in the faU are often found to have a mussed, crushed- 
out appearance. They can be made to look hke new, by foUovdng these simple 
directions: Wet the fur vrith a hair-brush, brushing up the wrong way of the 
fur. Leave it to dry in the air for about half an hour, and then give it a good 
beating on the right side with a rattan. After beating it, comb it with a coarwi 
comb, combing up the right way of the fur.

NOVEL DRESS MENDING. 
A novel way of mending a woolen or silk dress in which a round hole hai 
been torn, and where only a patch could remedy matters, is the following: The 
frayed portions around the tear should be carefully smoothed, and a piece of the 
material, moistened with very thin mucilage, placed under the hole. A heavy 
weight should be put upon it until it is dry, when it is only possible to discover 
the mended place by careful observation. 

TO RENEW OLD CRAPE. 
Place a little water in a teakettle, and let it boil until there is plenty of steam 
from the spout; then, holding the crape in both hands, pass it to and fro several 
times through the steam, and it will be clean and look nearly eqiial to new. 

TO RAISE THE PILE ON VELVET. 

To raise the pile on velvet, put on a table two pieces of wood; place between 
them, bottom side up, three very hot flat-irons, and over them lay a wet cloth; 
hold the velvet over the cloth, with the wrong side down; when thoroughly 
steamed, brush the pile with a hght wisp, and the velvet will look as good as 
new. 

TO CLEAN KID GLOVES. 

Make a thick mucUage by boiling a handful of flax-seed; add a little dissolved 
toilet soap; then, when the mixture cools, put the glove on the hands and rub 
them with a piece of white flannel wet with the mixture. Do not wet the 
gloves through. Or take a fme, clean, soft cloth, dip it into a httle sweet milk, 
then rub it on a cake of soap, and rub the gloves with it; they wfll look like 
new. 

Another good way to clean any color of kid gloves is to pour a little benzine 
into a basin and wash the gloves in it, rubbing and squeezing them until clean. 
If much soUed, they must be washed through clean benzine, and rinsed in a 
fresh supply. Hang up in the air to dry. 

STARCH POLISH. 
Take one ounce of spermaceti and one ounce of white wax; melt and run it 
into a thin cake on a plate. A piece the size of a quarter dollar added to a quart 
of prepared starch gives a beautiful lustre to the clothes and prevents the iron 
from sticking. 

FOR CLEANING JEWELRY, 
for cleaning jewelry there is nothing better than ammonia and water. K 
very duU or dirty, rub a httle soap on a soft brush and brush them in this wash. 



So6 MISCELLANEOUS RECIPES. 

rinse in cold water, dry first in an old handkerchief, and then rub with buck ox 
chaniois skin. Their freshness and brUUancy when thus cleaned cannot be sur- 
passed by any compound used by jewelers. 

TO CLEAN SILVER PLATE. 

Wash well in strong, warm soap-suds, rinse and wipe dry with a dry, soft 
cloth; then mix as much hartshorn powder as will be required into a thick paste, 
with cold water; spread this over the silver, with a soft cloth, and leave it for a 
little time to dry. When perfectly dry, brush it off with a clean soft cloth, or 
brush and pohsh it with a piece of chamois skin. Hartshorn is one of the best 
possible ingredients for plate powder for daily use. It leaves on the silver a 
deep, dark pohsh, and at the same time does not injure it. Whiting, dampened 
with liquid ammonia, is excellent also. 

TO REMOVE STAINS FROM MARBLE. 

Mix together one-half pound of soda, one-half pound of soft soap, and one 
pound of whiting. Boil them until they become as thick as paste, and let it 
cool. Before it is quite cold, spread it over the surface of the marble and leave 
it at least a whole day. Use a soft water to wash it off, and rub it well with 
soft cloths. For a black marble, nothing is better than spirits of turpentine. 

Another paste answers the same purpose: Take two parts of soda, one of 
pumice-stone, and one of finely-powdered chalk. Sift these through a fine 
sieve, and mix them into a paste with water. Eub this weU all over the mar- 
ble, and the stains wiU be removed; then wash it with soap and water, and a 
beautiful bright polish will be produced. 

TO WHITEN WALLS. 

To whiten walls, scrape off aU the old whitewash, and wash the walls with a 
solution of two ounces of white vitriol to four gallons of water. Soak a quarter 
of a pound of white glue in water for twelve hours; strain and place in a tin pail 
in a kettle of boHing water. When melted, stir in the glue eight pounds of 
whiting and water enough to make it as thick as common whitewash. Apply 
evenly with a good brush. If the walls are very yellow, blue the water slightly 
by squeezing in it a flannel blue-bag. 

Before kalsomining a wall, all cracks should be plastered over. Use plaster of 
Paris. Kalsomine may be colored easily by mixing with it yeUow ochre, Span- 
ish brown, indigo; squeeze through a bag into the water, etc.

PAPER-HANGERS' PASTE. 

To make paper-hangers' paste, beat up four pounds of good, white, wheat 
flour (well sifted previously) in sufl&cient cold water to form a stiff batter. Beat 
it well in order to take out all lumps, 'and then add enough cold water to make 
the mixture of the consistency of pudding batter. To this add about two ounces 
of weU-pounded alum. Pour gently and quickly over the batter boiling water, 
stirring rapidly at the same time, and when it is seen to lose the white color of 
the flour, it is cooked and ready. Do not use it, however, while hot, but allow 
it to cool. Pour about a pint of cold water over the top to prevent a skin from 
forming. Before using, the paste should be thinned by the addition of cold 
water. 

TO WASH COLORED GARMENTS. 

Delicately colored socks and stockings are apt to fade in washing. If they 
are soaked for a night ia a pail of tepid water containing a half pint of turpen- 
tine, then wrung out and dried, the colors wiU " set," and they can afterwards 
be washed without fading. 

For calicoes that fade, put a teaspoonful of sugar of lead into a pailful of 
water and soak the garment fifteen minutes before washing. 

THE MARKING SYSTEM. 
Mark all your own personal wardrobe which has to be washed. If this were 
invariably done, a great deal of property would be saved and a great deal of 
trouble would be spared. For the sake of saving trouble to others, if for no 
other reason, all of one's handkerchiefs, collars and underclothing shoiild be 
plainly and permanently marked. A bottle of indehble ink is cheap, a clean pen 
stiU cheaper, and a bright, sunny day or a hot flat-iron wHl complete the busi- 
ness. Always keep on hand a stick of Unen tape, written over its whole length 
with your name, or the names of your family, ready to be cut off and sewed on 
to stockings and such other articles as do not afford a good surface on which to 
mark. 

Then there are the paper patterns, of which every mother has a store. On 
the outside of each, as it is tied up, the name of the pattern should be plainly 
written. There are the rolls of pieces, which may contain a good deal not ap- 
parent from the outside. AH these hidden mysteries should be indicated. The 
winter things, which are wrapped up and put away for summer, and the sum- 
mer things, which are wrapped up and put away for the winter, should aU be in 
labeled packages, and every packing trunk should have on its lid a complete hst 

ot its contents. — Congregationalist.

50« MISCELLANEOUS HECj^ES. 

TO REMOVE STAINS AND SPOTS. 

Children's clothes, table linens, towels, etc., should be thoroughly examined 
before wetting, as soap-suds, washing-fluids, etc., will fix almost any stain past 
removal. Many stains will pass away by being simply washed in pure, soft 
water; or alcohol wiU remove, before the article has been in soap-suds, many 
stains; iron-mold, mildew, or almost any similar spot, can be taken out by 
dipping in diluted citric acid; then cover with salt and lay in the bright sun tOl 
the stain disappears. If of long standing, it may be necessary to repeat the wet- 
ting and the simlight. Be careful to rinse in several waters as soon as the stain 
is no longer visible. Ink, fruit, wine, and mildew stains must first be washed 
in clear, cold water, removing as much of the spots as can be; then mix one tea- 
spoonful of oxalic acid, and a half pint of rain water. Dip the stain in this, and 
wipe off in clear water. Wash at once, if a fabric that wiU bear washing. A 
tablespoonful of white currant juice, if any can be had, is even better than 
lemon. This preparation may be iised on the most delicate articles without in- 
jury. Shake it up before using it. Mark it " poison," and put it where it will 
not be meddled with. 

OIL STAINS IN SILK AND OTHER FABRICS. 

Benzine is most effectual, not only for sOk, but for any other material what- 
ever. It can be procured from any druggist. By simply covering both sides 
of greased silk with magnesia, and allowing it to remain for a few hours, the 
oil is absorbed by the powder. Should the first application be insufficient, it may 
be repeated, and even rubbed in with the hand. Should the silk be Tussah or 
Indian silk, it wiU wash. 

To remove an acid stain on violet silk: Brush the discoloration with tincture 
of iodine, then saturate the sjwt weU with a solution of hypo-sulphite of soda, 
and dry gradually. This restores theoriginal color perfectly. 

Muriatic acid is successfully used for removing ink stains and iron mold on 
a ninnber of colors which it does not attack. 

Sulphurous acid is only employed for whitening undyed goods, straw hats, 
etc., and for removing the stains of certain fruits on silks and woolens. Sul- 
phurous gas is also used for this purpose, but the liquid gas is safer. 

Oxalic acid is used for removing ink and rust stains, and renmants of mud 
stains, which do not yield to other deterrents. It may also be used for destroy- 
ing the stains of fruits and astringent juices, and old stains of mine. However, 
its use is Umited to white goods, as it attacks fugitive colors, and even Hgh(

shades of those reputed to be fast. The best method of applying it is to dissolve 
it ia cold or lukewarm water, to let it remain a moment upon the spot, and then 
rub it with the fingers. Wash out in clear, warm water, immediately. 

Citric acid serves to revive and brighten certain colors, especially greens and 
yellows. It restores scarlets which have been turned to a crimson by ttie action 
of alkalies. Acetic acid or tartaric acid may be used instead. 

Where it is feared that soap may change the color of an article, as, for in- 
stance, scarlet hosiery or hlac print, if the garment be not badly soiled, it may 
be cleansed by washing without soap in water in which pared potatoes have 
been boiled. This method wiU also prevent color from running in washing 
prints. 

To prevent blue from running into a white groimd, dissolve a teaspoonful of 
copperas in a pailful of soft water, add a piece of lime the size of an acorn, and 
soak the garments in this water two hours before washing. To keep colors from 
running in washing black prints, put a teaspoonfid of black pepper in the first 
water. 

Salt or beef's gaU in the water helps to set black. A tablespoonful of spirits 
of turpentine to a gallon of water sets most blues, and alum is very efficacious in 
setting green. Black or very dark calicoes should be stiffened with gum arable 
— five cents worth is enough for a dress. If however, starch is used, the gar- 
ment should be turned wrong side out. 

A simple way to remove grass stains is to spread butter on them, and lay thpi 
article in hot sunshine, or wash in alcohol. Fruit stains upon cloth or the handa 
may be removed by rubbing with the juice of ripe tomatoes. If applied imme- 
diately, powdered starch wiU also take fruit stains out of table linen. Left on 
the spot for a few hours, it absorbs every trace of the stain. 

For mildew stains or iron-rust, mix together soft soap, laundry starch, half 
as much salt, and the juice of a lemon. Apply to the spots, and spread the gar- 
ment on the grass. Or wet the hnen, rub into it white soap, then finely pow- 
dered chalk; lay upon the grass and keep damp. Old mildew stains may be 
removed by rubbing yeUow soap on both sides, and afterwards laying on, very 
thick, starch which has been dampened. Eub in well, and expose to light and 
air. 

There are several effectual methods of removing grease from cloths. First, 
wet with a hnen cloth dipped in chloroform. Second, mix four tablespoonfuls

Candle grease yields to a warm iron. Place a piece of blotting or other ab- 
sorbing paper under the absorbing fabric; put a piece of the paper also on the 
spot, apply the warm iron to the paper, and as soon as a spot of grease appears, 
move the paper and press again until the spot disappears. Lard wiU remove

To make linen beautifully white, prepare the water for washing by putting 
into every ten gallons a large handful of powdered borax; or boU with the

Fruit stains may be taken out by boiling water. Place the material over a 
basin or other vessel, and pour the boiUng water from the kettle over the stains. 

Pure water, cold or hot, mixed with acids, serves for rinsing goods in order 
to remove foreign and neutral bodies which cover the color. Steam softens 
fatty matters, and thus facOitates their removal by reagents. 

Sulphuric acid may be used in certain cases, particularly for brightening and 
raising greens, reds, yeUows, etc., but it must be diluted with at least one hun- 
dred times its weight of water and more in cases of delicate shades. 

CEMENT FOR CHINA AND GLASS. 

To half a pint of milk put an equal quantity of vinegar in order to curdle it; 
then separate the curd from the whey, and mix the whey vnth the whites of 
four or five eggs, beating the whole well together. When it is well-mixed, add 
a little quick-lime, through a sieve, until it has acquired the consistence of a 
thick paste. With this cement broken vessels and cracks of all kinds may be 
mended. It dries quickly, and resists the action of fire and water. 

Another: Into a thick solution of gum arabic, stir plaster of Paris until the 
mixture assumes the consistency of cream, apply with a brush to the broken 
edges of china and join together. In three days the article cannot be broken in 
the same place. The whiteness of the cement adds to its value. 

CLEANSING SINKS. 

To purify greasy sinks and pipes, pour down a pailful of boiling water in 
which three or four pounds of washing soda have been dissolved. A disinfect- 
ant is prepared in the same way, using copperas. Copperas is a poison and 
Stiould not be left about.

Leaks in waste pipes: — Shut yourself into a room from which the pipe starts. 
Put two or three ounces of oil of peppermint into a pail of boUing hot water and 
pour down the pipe. Another person who has not yet inhaled the strong odor 
should follow the course of the pipe through the house. The peppermint will be 
pretty sure to discover a break that even an expert plumber might overlook.

MANAGEMENT OF STOVES. 

If the fire in a stove has plenty of fresh coals on top not yet bimied through 

it win need only a little shaking to start it up; but if the fire looks dying and the 

coals look white, don't shake it. When it has drawn tiU it is red again, if there 

is much ash and Httle fire, put coals on very carefully. A mere handful of fire 

can be coaxed back to life by adding another handful or so of new coals on the 

red spot, and giving plenty of draught, but don't shake a dying fire, or you lose 

it. This management is often necessary after a warm spell, when the stove has 

been kept dormant for days, though I hope you will not be so unfortunate as to 

have a fire to coax up on a cold winter morning. They should be arranged over 

night, so that aU that is required is to open the draughts in order to have a 

cheery glow in a few minutes.

TO REMOVE INK FROM CARPETS. 

When freshly spilled, ink can be removed from carpets by wetting in milk, 
Take cotton batting and soak up all of the ink that it will receive, being careful 
not to let it spread. Then take fresh cotton, wet in milk, and sop it up care- 
fully. Eepeat this operation, changing cotton and milk each time. After most 
of the ink has been taken up in this way, with fresh cotton and clean, rub the 
spot. Continue tiU aU disappears; then wash the spot in clean warm water and 
a little soap; rinse in clear water and rub tiU nearly dry. If the ink is dried in, 
we know of no way that will not take the color from the carpet as well as the 
ink, unless the ink is on a white spot. In that case, salts of lemon, or soft soap, 
starch, and lemon juice, wiU remove the ink as easily as if on cotton. 

TO TAKE RUST OUT OF STEEL. 

If possible, place the article in a bowl containing kerosene oil, or wrap the 
steel up in a soft cloth well-saturated with kerosene; let it remain twenty-four 
hours or longer; then scour the rusty spots with brick dust; if badly rusted, use 
salt wet with hot vinegar; after scoiiring rinse every particle of brick dust or 
salt off with boiling hot water; dry thoroughly with flannel cloths, and place

TO MAKE A PASTE OR MUCILAGE TO FASTEN LABELS. 

Soften good ^ue in water, then boil it with strong vinegar, and thicken the 
liquid, during boiling, with fine wheat flom-, so that a paste results; or starch 
paste, with which a Uttle Venice turpentine has been incorporated while it was 
warm. 

A recipe for a transparent cement which possesses great tenacity and has not 
the sUghtest yellow tinge: Mix in a well-stoppered bottle ten drachms of chloro- 
form with ten and one-half of non- vulcanized caoutchouc (rubber) cut in small 
pieces. Solution is readily effected, and when it is completed add two and one- 
half dra^imis of mastic. Let the whole macerate from eight to ten days without 
the application of any heat, and shake the contents of the bottle at intervals. 
A perfedily white and very adhesive cement is the result. 

POSTAGE STAMP MUCILAGE. 
Take of gum dextrine, two parts; acetic acid, one part; water, five parts. 

Dissolve in a water bath and add alcohol one part. 

— Scientific American. 

Grum of great strength, which will also keep for a long time, is prepared by 
dissolving equal parts of gum arable and gum tragacanth in vinegar. A Uttle 
vinegar added to ordinary gum water will make it keep much better. 

FAMILY GLUE. 
Crack the glue and put it in a bottle; add common whiskey; shake up, cork 
tight, and in three or four days it can be used. It requires no heating, will keep 
for almost any length of time, and is at all times ready to use, except in the 
coldest of weather, when it will require warming. It must be kept tight, so 
that the whiskey will not evaporate. The usual corks or stoppers should not. be 
used. It win become clogged. A tin stopper covering the bottle, but fitting as 
closely as possible, must be used. 

GLUE. 

Olue to resist heat and moisture is made as follows: Mix a handful of quick- 
lime in four ounces of linseed oil, boQ to a good thickness, then spread it on tin 
plates ia the shade, and it wfll become very hard, but may be easily dissolved 
over the fire as ^ue. 

A glue which will resist the action of water is made by boiling one pound of 
common glue in two quarts of skimmed milk.

FURNITURE CREAM. 
Shred finely two ounces of beeswax and half an ounce of white wax into 
half a pint of turpentine; set in a warm place until dissolved, then pour over the 
mixture the following, boUed together until melted: — Half a pint of water, an 
ounce of castUe soap, and a piece of resin the size of a small nutmeg. Mix 
thoroughly, and keep in a wide-necked stone bottle for use. This cleans well, 
and leaves a good pohsh, and may be made at a fourth of the price it is sold at. 

CEMENT CRACKS IN FLOOR. 

Cracks in floors may be neatly but permanently filled by thoroughly soaking 
newspapers in paste made of half a pound of flour, three quarts of water and 
half a poimd of alum mixed and boiled. The mixture will be about as thick as 
putty, and may be forced into the crevice with a case knife. It will harden like 
papier-mache. 

A POLISH FOR LADIES' KID SHOES. 
A fine hquid pohsh for ladies' kid shoes, satchels, etc., that is easy of appli- 
cation, recommended as contaioing no ingredients in any manner injurious to 
leather, is found by digesting in a close vessel at gentle heat, and straining, a 
solution made as follows: lamplack, one drachm; oil turpentine, four drachms; 
alcohol, (trymethyl), twelve ounces; shellac, one and one-half ounces; white 
turpentine, five drachms; saudarac, two drachms. 

PASTE FOR SCRAP-BOOKS, ETC. 

Paste that will keep. — Dissolve a teaspoonful of alum in a quart of water. 
When cold, stir in flour, to give it the consistency of thick cream, being par- 
ticular to beat up aU the lumps. Stir in as much powdered resin as wiU he on a 
dime, and throw in half a dozen cloves to give it a pleasant odor. Have on the 
fire a teacupful of boiling water; pom- the flour mixture into it, stirring well aU 
the time. In a few minutes it wiU be of the consistency of molasses. Pour it into 
an earthen or china vessel, let it cool, and stir in a small teaspoonful each of oil 
of cloves and of sassafras; lay a cover on, and put in a cool place. Wlien needed 
for use, take out a portion and soften it with warm water. This is a, fine paste

A CEMENT FOR ACIDS. 
A cement which is proof against boning acids may be made by a composition 
of India rubber, taUow, hme and red lead. The India rubber must first b^ 
melted by a gentle heat, and then six to eight per cent, by weight of tallow i^ 
added to the mixture while it is kept weU-stirred; next day slaked hme is ap: 
pUed, until the fluid mass assumes a consistency similar to that of soft paste; 
lastly, twenty per cent, of red lead is added, in order to make it harden and dry, 

TO KEEP CIDER. 

Allow three-fourths of a pound of sugar to the gallon, the whites of six eggs, 
well beaten, a handful of common salt. Leave it open until fermentation ceases, 
then bung up. This process a dealer in cider has used for years, and always 
successfully. 

Another recipe: — To keep cider sweet allow it to work until it has reached 
the state most desirable to the taste, and then add one and a half tumblers of 
grated horse-radish to each barrel, and shake up weU. This arrests further 
fermentation. After remaining a few weeks, rack otf and bung up closely in 
clean casks. 

A gentleman of Denver writes he has a sure preservative: Put eighl^gaUons 
of cider at a time into a clean barrol; take one ounce of powdered charcoal; and 
one ounce of powdered sulphur; mix, and put it into some iron vessel that will 
go down through the bung-hole of the barrel. Now put a piece of red-hot iroi^ 
into the charcoal and sulphur, and while it is burning, lower it through the 
bung-hole to within one foot of the cider, and suspend it there by a piece of 
wire. Bring it up and in twelve hours you can cure another batch. Put the. 
cider in a tight barrel and keep in a cool cellar and it will keep for years. "\ 

A Holland recipe: — To one quart of new milk, fresh from the cow (not 
strained), add one-half pound of ground black mustard seed and six eggs. Beat 
the whole well together, and pour into a barrel of cider. It wiU keep cider sweet 
for one year or more. 

TO BLEACH COTTON CLOTH. 
Take one large spoonful of sal soda and one pound of chloride hme for thir- 
ty yards; dissolve in clean, soft water; rinse the cloth thoroughly in cold, 



MiSCELLANEO US JRECIPES. 5 1 5 

soft water so that it may not rot. This amount of cloth may be bleached in 
fourteen or fifteen minutes. 

A POLISH FOR LEATHER, 

Put a half pound of shellac broken up in small pieces into a quart bottle or 
jug, cover it with alcohol, cork it tight, and put it on the shelf in a warm place; 
shake it well several times a day, then add a piece of camphor as large as a hen'^s 
egg; shake it well, and in a few hours shake it again and add one oimce of lamp- 
black. If the alcohol is good, it will aU be dissolved in two days; then shake 
and use. If the materials were of the proper kind, the pohsh correctly prepared, 
it will dry in about five minutes, giving a gloss equal to patent leather. Using 
aniline dyes instead of the lampblack, you can have it any desired color, and it 
can be used on wood or hard paper. 

TO SOFTEN WATER. 

Add half a pound of the best quick lime dissolved in water to every hundred 
gallons. Smaller proportions may be more conveniently managed, and if al- 
lowed to stand a short time the Ume wHl have united with the carbonate of lime, 
and been deposited at the bottom of tfae receptacle. Another way is to put a 
gallon of lye into a barrelf ul of wate*, or two or three shovels full of wood-ashes, 
let stand over night; it wiU be clea^ and soft. 

WASHING FLUID. 
One gallon of water and fom- pounds of ordinary washing soda, and a quar- 
ter of a pound of soda. Heat the water to bqiling hot, put in the soda, boil 
about five minutes, then pour it over two pounds of unslaked hme, let it bubble 
and foam until it settles, turn it off and bottle it for use. This is the article that 
is used in the Chinese laimdries for whitening their Hnen, and is called " JaveUe 
water;" a tablespoonful put into a suds of three gallons, and a Httle, say a quar- 
ter of a cupful, in the boiler when boiUng the clothes, makes them very white 
&Ssh. clear. Must be weU-rinsed afterwards. This preparation will remove tea 
Stains, and almost aU ordmary stains of fruit, grass, etc. This fluid brightens 
the colors of colored clothes, does not rot them, but should not be left long in 
any water; the boihng, sudsing, rinsing and blueuig, should be done in quick 
succession, until the clothes are ready to hang on the hne. 

HARD SOAP (Washing.) 
Six potmds of washing soda, and three of imslaked Ume. Pour on four gal- 
lons of boiling water, let it stand until perfectly clear, then drain off, and put in

six pounds of clean fat. Boil it until it begins to harden about two hours, stir- 
ring most of the time. While boiling, thin it with two gallons of cold water, 
which you have previously poured on the alkaline mixture, after draining oflE 
the four gallons. This must be settled clear before it is drawn off. Add it when 
there is danger of boiling over. Try the thickness by cooling a little on a plate. 
Put in a handful of salt just before taking from the fire. Wet a tub to prevent 
sticking; turn iu the soap, and let it stand until solid. Cut into bars, put on a 
board and let it dry. This makes about forty pounds of soap. It can be 
flavored just as you turn it out. 

SOAP FOR WASHING WITHOUT RUBBING. 
A soap to clean clothes without rubbing: Take two pounds of sal soda, two 
pounds of common bar soap, and ten quarts of water. Cut the soap iu thin slices, 
and boil together two hours; strain, and it wiU be fit for use. Put the clothes 
in soak the night before you wash, and to every pailful of water in which you 
boil them add a pound of soap. They wiU need no rubbing, but merely rinsing, 

TO MAKE SOFT SOAP WITHOUT COOKING. 

Pour two paUfuls of boiling water upon twenty pomids of potash, and let it 
stand two hours. Have ready thirty pounds of clean grease, upon which pour 
one pailful of the lye, adding another paD. of water to the potash; let it stand 
three or four hours, stir it well; then pour a gallon of the lye upon the grease, 
stir it well; and in half an hour another gallon of the lye, stir it thoroughly; iu 
half an hour repeat the process, and thus proceed until you have poured off all 
the lye; then add two pails of boidng hot water to the remainder of the potashes, 
and let it stand ten hours; then stir the mixture, and if it has become stiff, and 
the grease has disappeared from the surface, take out a little, and see whether 
the weak lye wiU thicken it; if it does, add the lye; i£ it does not, try water, and 
if that thickens it, let it stand another day, stirring it well five or six times dm"- 
ing the day; if the lye does not separate from the grease you may fill up with 
water. 

OLD-STYLE FAMILY SOFT SOAP. 

To set the leach, bore several holes in the bottom of a barrel; or use one with- 
out a bottom; prepare a board larger than the barrel, then set the barrel on it, 
and cut a grove around just outside the barrel, making one grove from this to 
the edge of the board, to carry off the lye as it runs off, with a groove around it, 
running into one in the centre of the board. Place aU two feet from the ground 
aJid tip it so that the lye may run easily from the board into the vessel below

prepared to receive it. Put half bricks or stones around the edge of the inside 
of the barrel; place on them one end of some sticks about two inches wide, in- 
clining to the centre; on those place some straw to the depth of two inches, over 
it scatter two pounds of slaked Ume. Put in ashes, about half of a bushel at a 
time, pack it well, by pounding it down, and continue doing so untU the barrel 
is fuU, leaving a funnel-shaped hoUow in the centre large enough to hold several 
quarts of water. Use rain water boiling hot. Let the water disappear before 
adding more. If the ashes are packed very tightly it may require two or three 
days before the lye will begin to run, but it will be the stronger for it, and much 
better. 

To make boiled soft soap. Put in a kettle the grease consisting of aU kinds 
of fat that has accumulated in the kitchen, such as scraps and bones from the 
soup-kettle, rinds from meat, etc. ; fill the kettle half fuU; if there is too much 
grease it can be skimmed off after the soap is cold, for another kettle of soap. 
This is the only true test when enough grease is used, as the lye wiU consume all 
that is needed and no more. Make a fire under one side of it. The kettle should 
be in an out-house or out of doors. Let it heat very hot so as to fry; stir occa- 
sionally to prevent burning. Now put in the lye a gallon at a time, watching 
it closely imtii it boils, as it sometimes runs over at the beginning. Add lye 
imtil the kettle is fuU enough, but not too full to boil well. Soap should boil 
from the side and not the middle, as this would be more hkely to cause it to 
boil over. To test the soap, to one spoonfiil of soap add one of rain-water; if 
it stirs up Yety thick, the soap is good and wiU keep; if it becomes thinner, it is 
not good. This is the resvilt of one of three causes, either it is too weak, or 
there is a deposit of dirt, or it is too strong. Continue to boU for a few hours, 
when it should flow from the stick with which it is stirred, hke thick molasses; 
but if after boiling it remains thin, let it stand over night, removing it from the 
fire, then draining it off very carefully into another vessel, being very particular 
to prevent any sediment from passing. Wash the kettle, return the soap, and 
boil again, if dirt was the cause; it wiU now be thick and good; otherwise, if 
it was too strong, rain-water added wiU make it right, adding the water grad- 
ually until right and just thick enough. 



An agreeable Disinfectant: Sprinkle fresh ground coffee on a shovel of hot 
coals, or bum sugar on hot coals. Vinegar boiled with myrrh, sprinkled on the 
floor and furniture of a sick room, are excellent deodorizers. 

To prevent Mold: A small quantity of carboHc acid added to paste, mucilage, 
and ink, will prevent mold. An ounce of the acid to a gallon of white- wash will 
keep cellars and dairies from the disagreeable odor which often taints milk and 
meat kept in such places. 

To make Tracing-paper: — Dissolve a ball of white bees- wax, one inch in di- 
ameter, in half a pint of turpentine. Saturate the paper in this bath and let it 
dry two or three days before using. 

To preserve Brooms: Dip them for a minute or two in a kettle of boiling suds 
once a week and they wiU last much longer, making them tough and phable. A 
carpet wears much longer swept with a broom cared for in this manner. 

To clean Brass-ware, etc. : Mix one ounce of oxalic acid, six ounces of rotten 
stone, aU in powder, one ounce of sweet oil, and sufficient water to make a paste. 
Apply a small portion, and rub dry with a flannel or leather. The liquid dip 
most generally used consists of nitric and sulphviric acids; but this is more cor- 
rosive.

To destroy Moths in Furniture: All the baking and steaming are useless, 
as, although the moths may be killed, their eggs are sure to hatch, and the up- 
holstery to be well riddled. The naphtha-bath process is effectual. A sofa, 
chair or lounge may be immersed in the large vats used for the purpose, and all 
insect hfe will be absolutely destroyed. No egg ever hatches after passing 
through the naphtha-bath; all oil, dirt, or grease disappears, and not the sUght- 
est damage is done to the most costly article. Sponging with naphtha will not 
answer. It is the immersion for two hours or more in the specially prepared 
vats which is effectual. 

Slicing Pine-apples: The knife used for peehng a pine-apple should not be 
used for slicing it, as the rind contains an acid that is apt to cause a swollen 
mouth and sore lips. The Cubans use salt as an antidoie for the ill effects of 
the peel. 

To clean Iron Sinks: Rub them well with a cloth wet with kerosene oil. 

To erase Discoloration on Stone-china: Dishes and cups that are used for 
baking custards, puddings, etc., that require scouring, maybe easily cleaned by 
rubbing with a damp cloth dipped in whiting or "Sapolio," then washed as 
usual. 

To remove Ink, Wine or Fruit Stains: Satvirate well in tomato juice; it is 
also an excellent thing to remove stains from the hands. 

To set Colors in Washable Goods: Soak them previous to washing in a 
water in which is allowed a tablespoonful of ox-gaU to a gallon of water. 

To take out Paint: Equal parts of ammonia and turpentine will take paint 
out of clothing, no matter how dry or hard it may be. Satiirate the spot two or 
three times, then wash out in soap-suds. Ten cents' worth of oxalic acid dis- 
solved in a pint of hot water will remove paint spots from the windows. Pour 
a httle into a cup, and apply to the spots with a swab, but be sure not to allow 
the acid to touch the hands. Brasses may be quickly cleaned with it. Great 
care must be exercised in labelling the bottle, and putting it out of the reach of 
children, as it is a deadly poison. 

To remove Tar from Cloth: Saturate the spot and rub it well with turpen- 
tine, and every trace of tar wiU be removed.

a little alcohol is commonly added to it with a few bruised cloves, and the whole 
digested together, with occasional agitation for a week or fortnight, when the 
clear portion is decanted, and, if necessary, filtered. Sometimes a little com-

To obtain a good complexion a person's diet should receive the first attention. 
Greasy food, highly spiced soups, hot bread and butter, meats or game, rich

vous system is necessary to beauty. Eating between meals, late suppers, over- 
eating at meals, eating sweetmeats, candies, etc., aU these tend to disorder the 
blood, producing pimples and blotches. 

Washing of the face or skin is another consideration for a good complexion; 
it should be thoroughly washed in plenty of lukewarm water with some mild 
soap — then rinsed in clear water weU\ dry with a thick soft towel. If suds is 
left or wiped off the skin, the action of the air and sun wiU tan the surface,

HOW TO KEEP BRUSHES CLEAN. 

The best way in which to clean hair-brushes is with spirits of ammonia, as 
its effect is immediate. No rubbing is required, and cold water can be used just 
as successfully as warm. Take a tablespoonful of ammonia to a quart of water, 
dip the hair part of the brush without wetting the ivory, and in a moment the 
grease is removed; then rinse in cold water, shake well, and dry in the air, but 
not in the sun. Soda and soap soften the bristles and invariably turn the ivory 
yellow.

Mutton tallow is considered excellent to soften the hands. It may be rubbed 
on at any time when the hands are perfectly dry, but the best time is when 
retiring, and an old pair of soft, large gloves thoroughly covered on the inside 
with the tallow and glycerine in equal parts, melted together, can be worn dur- 
ing the night with the most satisfactory results. 

Four parts of glycerine and five parts of yolks of eggs thoroughly mixed, and 
apphed after washing the hands, is also considered excellent. 

For chapped hands or face: One ounce of glycerine, one ounce of alcohol 
mixed, then add eight ounces of rose-water. 

Another good rule is to rub well in dry oatmeal after every washing, and be 
particular regarding the quality of soap. Cheap soap and hard water are the un- 
known enemies of many people, and the cause of rough skin and chapped hands. 
CastUe soap and rain-water will sometimes cure without any other assistance. 

Camphor ice is also excellent, and can be apphed with but Uttle incon- 
venience. Borax dissolved and added to the toilet water is also good. 

For chapped lips, beeswax dissolved ia a small quantity of sweet oil, by heat- 
ing carefully. Apply the salve two or three times a day, and avoid wetting the 
hps as much as possible. 

To soften the hands: One can have the hands in soap-suds with soft soap 
without injury to the skin if the hands are dipped in vinegar or lemon- juice im- 
mediately after. The acids destroy the corrosive effects of the alkali, and make 
the hands soft and white. Indian meal and vinegar or lemon-juice used on hands 
where roughened by cold or labor wiU heal and soften them. Rub the hands in 
this, then wash off thoroughly and rub in glycerine. Those who suffer from 
chapped hands wiU find this comforting.

An ingenious housewife will manage to do with less conveniences, but these 
Bj^icles, if they can be purchased in the commencement of housekeeping, will 
save time and labor, making the preparation of food more easily — and it is al- 
ways economy in the end to get the best material in aU wares — as, for instance, 
the double plate tin will last for years, whereas the poor kind has to be replaced 
in a short time; the low-priced earthenware is soon broken up, whereas the 
strong stone ware, costing but a trifle more, lasts almost a lifetime. 

In relation to the economy and management of the kitchen, I might suggest 
that the most essential thing is cleanliness in cooking, and dlso cleanliness with 
your person as well as in the keeping, of the kitchen. 

35 



540 MISCELLANEOUS. 

The hands of the cook should be always thoroughly cleansed before touching 
or handling anything pertaining to the cooking. Next there should never be any 
wasted or thrown away that can be turned to account, either for your own fam- 
ily or some family in poor circumstances. Bread that has become hard can 
be used for toasting, or for stufling and pudding. In warm weather any 
gravies or soups that are left from the preceding day should be boiled up and 
poured into clean pans. This is particjaarly necessary where vegetables have 
bean added to the preparation, as it then so soon turns sour. In cooler weather, 
every other day wiU be often enough to warm up these things. 

In cooking, clear as you go; that is to say, do not allow a host of basins, 
plates, spoons, and other utensils, to accumulate on the dressers and tables whilst 
you are engaged in preparing the dinner. By a httle management and fore- 
thought, much confusion may be saved in this way. It is as easy to put a thing 
in its place when it is done with, as it is to keep continually moving it to find 
room for fresh requisites. For instance, after making a pudding, the flour-tub, 
paste-board, and roUing-pin, should be put away, and any basins, spoons, etc., 
should be neatly packed up near the sink, to be washed when the proper time 
arrives. Neatness, order, and method should be always observed. 

Never let your stock of spices, salt, seasonings, herbs, etc., dwindle down so 
low that some day, in the midst of preparing a large dinner, you find yourself 
minus a very important ingredient, thereby causing much confusion and annoy- 
ance. 

After you have washed your sauce-pans, fish-kettle, etc., stand them before 
the fire for a few minutes to get thoroughly dry inside, before putting them 
away. They should then be kept in a dry place, in order that they may escape 
the deteriorating influence of rust, and thereby be quickly destroyed, ^ever 
leave sauce-pans dirty from one day's use to be cleaned the next; it is slovenly 
and untidy. 

Do not be afraid of hot water in washing up dishes and dirty cooking uten- 
sils. As these are essentially greasy, lukewarm water cannot possibly have the 
effect of cleansing them effectually. Do not be chary also of changing and re- 
newing the water occasionally. Tou will thus save yourself much tinae and 
labor in the long run. 

Keep a cake of sapoho always on hand in the kitchen — always convenient for 
rubbing off stains, from earthenware, tin, glass, in fact, almost every thing but 
silver; it is a cheap and valuable article, and can be purchased at nearly every 
grocery in the United States.

GENERAL REMARKS. 

Everything should be clean. The goods should be scoured in soap and the 
soap rinsed out. They are often steeped in soap lye over night. Dip them into 
water just before putting them into preparations, to prevent spotting. Soft 
water should be used, sufficient to cover the goods well; this is always under- 
stood where quantity is not mentioned. When goods are dyed, air them; then 
rinse weU, and hang up to dry. Do not wring sUk or merino dresses when 
scouring or dyeing them. If cotton goods are to be dyed a light color, they 
should first be bleached. 

SILKS. 

Black: — Make a weak lye as for black or woolens; work goods in bichromate 
of potash a little below boiling heat, then dip in the logwood in the same way; 
if colored in blue vitriol dye, use about the same heat. 

Orange: — For one pound goods, annotto, one pound; soda, one pound; repeat 
as desired* 

Oreen: — Very Handsome:— ¥ot one pound goods, yeUow oak bark, eight 
ounces; boil one-half hour; turn off the hquor from bark and add alum, six 
ovmces; let it stand until cold; while making this, color goods in blue dye- tub a 
light blue; dry and wash; dip in alum and bark dye. If it does not take weU, 
warm the dye a little. 

Purple: — For one pound goods. First obtain a light blue, by dipping in home- 
made dye-tub; then dry; dip in alum, four ounces; with water to cover, when 
little warm. If color is not fuU enough add chemic. 

Yellow: — For one pound goods, alum, three ounces; sugar of lead, three- 
foiniihs ounce; immerse goods in solution over night; take out; drain, and make 
a new lye with fustic, one pound; dip until the required color is obtained. 

Crimson: — For one poimd goods — alum, three ounces; dip at hand heat one 
hour; take out and drain while making new dye by boiUng ten minutes, cochi- 
neal, three ounces; bruised nutgaUs, two oimces; and cream-tartar, one-fonrth 
ounce, in one paH of water; when little cool, begin to dip, raising heat to boU; 
dip one hour; wash and dry. 

Sky Blue on Silk or Cotton: — Very Beautiful: — Give goods as much color 
from a solution of blue vitriol, two ounces, to water, one gallon, as it wiU take 
up in dipping fifteen minutes; then run it through lime water. This wOl make 
a beautiful and durable sky blue. 



542 MISCELLANEOUS. 

Brown on Silk or Cotton: — Very Beautiful: — After obtaining a blue color as 
above, run goods through a solution of prussiate of potash, one ounce, to water, 
one gallon. 

lAght Blue: — For cold water, one gallon, dissolve alum, one-half tablespoon- 
ful, in hot water, one teacupful, and add to it; then add chemic, one teaspoon- 
ful at a time to obtain the desired color — ^the more chemic the darker the color, 

WOOLEN GOODS. 

Chrome Black: — Best in Use: — For five pounds of goods, blue vitriol six 
ounces; boil a few minutes, then dip the goods three-fourths of an hour, airing 
often; take out the goods, make a dye with three pounds of logwood, boU one- 
half hour; dip three-fourths of an hour, and air goods, and dip three-fourths of 
an hour more. Wash in strong suds. This will not fade by exposure to svm. 

Wine Color: — For five povmds of goods, camwood, two pounds; boU fifteen 
minutes arid dip the goods one-half hour; boil again and dip one-half hour; then 
darken with blue vitriol, one and one-half ounces; if not dark enough, add cop- 
peras, one-half oimce. 

Scarlet: — Very Fine: — For one pound of goods, cream tartar one-half ounce; 
cochineal, weU-pulverized, one-half ounce; muriate of tin,two and one-half ounces; 
boil up the dye and enter the goods; work them briskly for ten or fifteen min- 
utes, then boil one and one-half homrs, stirring goods slowly while boihng. 
Wash in clear water and dry in the shade. 

Pink: — For three pounds of goods, alum three ounces; boU. and dip the goods 
one hour, then add to the dye, cream-tartar, four oimces; cochineal, weU-pul- 
verized, one oimce; boil weU and dip the goods while boiling until the color 
suits. 

Blue: — Quick Process: — For two pounds of goods, alum, five ounces; cream- 
tartar, three ounces; boil goods in this one hour, then put goods into warm water 
which has more or less extract of indigo in it, according to the depth of color de- 
sired, and boU. again untU it suits, adding more of the blue if needed. 

Madder Bed :~To each pound of goods, alum, five ounces; red, or cream- 
tartar, one ounce. Put iu the goods and bring the kettle to a boU, for one-half 
hotu-; then air them and boU one-half hour longer; empty the kettle and fill with 
clean water; put in bran, one peck; make it milk- warm, and let it stand imtil 
the bran rises; then skim off the bran and put in one-half pound madder; put in 
the goods and heat slowly untU it boils and is done. Wash in strong suds. 

Green: — For each pound of goods, fustic, one pound; with alum, three and 
one-half ounces; steep untU strength is out, and soak the goods thereiu until a 



MISCELLANEOUS. 343 

good yellow is obtained; then remove the chips, and add extract of indigo or 
chemic, one tablespoonful at a time, until color suits. 

Snuff Brown, Dark: — For five pounds of goods, camwood, one pound; boil it 
fifteen minutes, then dip the goods three-fourths of an hour; take out the goods, 
and add to the dye two and one -half pounds fustic; boU ten minutes, and dip 
the goods three-fourths of an hour; then add blue vitriol, one ounce; copperas, 
four ounces; dip again one-half hour. If not dark enough, add more copperas. 

Another Method: — Any Shade: — Boil the goods in a mordant of alum, two 
parts, copperas three parts; then rinse them through a bath of madder. The 
tint depends on the relative proportions of the copperas and alum; the more cop- 
peras, the darker the dye; joint weight of both should not be more than one- 
eighth of weight of good,s. Mixtures of red and yeUows with blues and blacks, 
or simple dyes, will make any shade. 

Orange: — For five povmds of goods, muriate of tin, six tablespoonfuls; argal, 
four ounces; boU and dip one hour, and add again to the dye one teacupful of 
madder; dip again one-half hour. Cochineal, about two ounces, in place of mad- 
der, makes a much brighter color. 

Purple: — For each povmd of goods, two oimces of cudbear; rinse the goods 
weU in soap-suds, then dissolve cudbear in hot suds — not quite boiling, and soak 
the goods untU of required color. The color is brightened by rinsing in alum 
water. 

Yellow: — Rich: — Work five pounds of goods one-half hour in a boiling bath 
with three ounces bichromate oE potassa and two ounces alum; lift and expose 
tiU weU-cooled and drained; then work one-half hour in another bath with five 
pounds of fvistic. Wash out and dry. 

Crimson: — Work for one hour in a bath with one pound cochineal paste; 
six ounces of dry cochineal; one pound of tartar; one pint of protochloride of tin. 
Wash out and dry. 

Salmon: — For each pound of goods, one-fourth pound of annatto; one-fourth 
pound of soap; rinse the goods well in warm water, put them into mixture and 
boil one-half hour. Shade will be according to the amount of annatto. 

Dove and Slate Colors of all Shades: — Boil in an iron vessel a teacupful of 
black tea with a teaspoonful of copperas, and sufficient water. Dilute tiU you 
get the shade wanted. 

COTTON GOODS. 

Black:— YoY five pounds of goods, boil them in a decoction of three pounds 
of sumach one-half hour, and steep twelve hours; dip in lime-water one-half 
hour; take out and let them drip one hour, run them through the Ume-wator 



144 MISCELLANEOUS. 

again fifteen minutes. Make a new dye with two and orie-haJf pounds logwood 
(boiled one hour), and dip again three hours; add bichromate potash, two ounces, 
to the logwood dye and dip one hour. Wash in clear, cold water and dry in 
the shade. Only process for permanent black. 

Sky Blue:— For three pounds of goods, blue vitriol, four ounces; boU a few 
miautes, then dip the goods three hours; then pass them through a strong lime- 
water. A beautiful brown can be obtained by next putting the goods through 
a solution of prussiate of potash. 

Green:— Dip the goods in home-made blue; dye until blue enough is obtained 
.to rnake the green as dark as required; take out, dry and rinse, a little. Make a 
dye with fustic, three pounds, of logwood three ounces, to each pound of 
goods, by boiling dye one hour; when cooled so as to bear the hand put in the 
goods, move briskly a few minutes, and let lie one hour; take out and thoroughly 
drain; dissolve and add to the dye for each pomid of cotton, blue vitriol, one-half 
ounce, and dip another hour. Wring out and let dry in the shade. By adding 
or diminishing the logwood and fustic, auy shade may be had. 

Yellow :-r-For five pounds of goods, seven ounces of sugar of lead; dip the 
goods two hours; make a new dye with bichromate of potash, four ounces; dip 
until the color suits; wring out and dry. If not yellow enough, repeat. 

Orange: — For five pounds of goods, sugar of lead, four oimces; boil a few 
minutes; when a little cool, put in the goods; dip for two hours; wring out; 
make a new dye with bichromate potash, eight ounces, madder two oimces; dip 
imtn it suits; if color is too red, take a small sample and dip into Ume- water and 
choose between them. 

Bed: — Muriate of tin, two-thirds of a teacupful; add water to cover the goods; 
raise to boUing heat; put in the goods one hour; stir often; take out, empty the 
kettle, put in clean water with nic-wood, one pound; steep one-half hour at hand 
heat; then put in the goods and increase the heat one hour — not boiling. Air 
the goods and dip them one hour as before. Wash without soap. 



Small points on ZnUc Etiquette^ 

Delicacy of maimer at table stamps both man and woman, for one can, at a 
glance, discern whether a person has been trained to eat well — i. e. to hold the 
knife and fork properly, to eat without the sUghtest sound of the Ups, to drink 
quietly, to use the napkin rightly, to make no noise with any of the implements 



*. miscella^jsous. 545 

ofr.the table, and last., but not least, to eat slowly and masticate the food tho- 
roughly. AH these'points should be most carefully taught to children, and then 
they wiU always feel at their ease at the grandest tables in the land. There is 
no position where the innate refinement of a person is more fuUy exhibited than 
at the table, and nowhere that those who have not been trained in table etiquette 
feel more keenly their deficiencies. The knife should never be used to carry 
food to the mouth, but only to cut it up into small mouthfuls; then place it upon 
the plate at one side, and take the fork in the right hand, and eat aU the food 
with it. When both have been used finally, they should be laid diagonally across 
the plate, with both handles towards the right hand; this is imderstood by well' 
trained waiters, to be the signal for removing them, together with the plate. 

Be careful to keep the mouth shut closely while masticating the food. It ie 
the opening of the lips which causes the smacking which seems very disgusting. 
Chew your food well, but do it silently, and be careful to take small mouthfuls. 
The knife can be used to cut the meat finely, as large pieces of meat are not 
healthful, and appears very indehcate. At many tables, two, three or more 
knives and forks are placed on the table, the knives at the right hand of the 
plate, the forks at the left, — a knife and a fork for each coiu-se, so that there 
need be no replacing of them after the breakfast or dinner is served. The 
smaller ones, which are for game, dessert, or for hot cakes at breakfast, can 
be tucked imder the edges of the plate, and the large ones, for the meat and veg- 
etables, are placed outside of them. Be very careful not to clatter your knives 
and forks upon your plates, but use them without noise. When you are helped 
to anything, do not wait imtil the rest of the company are provided, it is not 
considered good breeding. When passing the plate for a second helping, lay 
them together at one side of the plate, with handles to the right. Soup is al- 
ways served for the first course, and it should be eaten with dessert spoons, and 
taken from the sides, not the tips of them, without any sound of the lips, and 
not sucked into the mouth audibly from the ends of the spoon. Bread should 
not be broken into soup or gravy. Never ask to be helped to soup a second time. 
The hostess may ask you to take a second plate, but you will politely decline. 
Fish chowder, which is served in soup plates, is said to be an exception which 
proves this rule, and when eating of that it is correct to take a second plateful, 
if desired. 

Another generally neglected obUgation is that of spreading butter on one's 
bread as it Ues in one's plate, or but sKghtly lifted at one end of the plate; it is 
very frequently buttered in the air, bitten in gouges, and still held in the face 
and eyes of the table with the marks of the teeth on it. I'his is certainly not 



546 MISCELLANEOUS. 

altogether pleasant, and it is better to cut it, a bit at a time, after buttering it, 
and put piece by piece in the mouth with one's finger and thumb. Never help 
yourself to butter, or any other food with your own knife or fork. It is not con- 
sidered good taste to mix food on the same plate. Salt must be left on the side 
of the plate and never on the table-cloth. 

Let us mention a few things concerning the eating of which there is some- 
times doubt. A cream-cake and anything of similar nature should be eaten 
with knife and fork, never bitten. Asparagus — which should be always served 
on bread or toast, so as to absorb superfluous moisture — may be taken from the 
finger and thumb; if it is fit to be set before you, the whole of it may be eaten. 
Pastry should be broken and eaten with a fork, never cut with a knife. Raw 
oysters should be eaten with a fork, also fish. Peas and beans, as we all know, 
require the fork only; however, food that cannot be held with a fork should be 
eaten with a spoon. Potatoes, if mashed, should be mashed with the fork. 
Green corn should be eaten from the cob; but it must be held with a single 
hand. 

Celery, cresses, ohves, radishes, and relishes of that kind are, of course, to 
be eaten with the fingers; the salt should be laid upon one's plate, not upon the 
cloth. Fish is to be eaten with the fork, without the assistance of the knife; a 
bit of bread in the left hand sometimes helps one to master a refractory morsel. 
Fresh fruit should be eaten with a silver bladed-knife, especially pears, apples, 
etc. 

Berries, of course, are to be eaten with a spoon. In England they are served 
with their hulls on, and three or four are considered an ample quantity. But 
then in England they are many times the size of om-s; there they take the big 
berry by the stem, dip into powdered sugar, and eat it as we do the turnip rad- 
ish. It is not proper to drink with a spoon in the cup; nor should one, by-the- 
way, ever quite drain a cup or glass. 

Don't, when you drink, elevate your glass as if you were going to stana it 
inverted on your nose. Bring the glass perpendicularly to the Ups, and then hft 
it to a shght angle. Do this easily. 

Drink sparingly while eating. It is far better for the digestion not to drink 
tea or coffee until the meal is finished. Drink gently, and do not pour it down 
yOur throat Uke water turned out of a pitcher. 

When seating yourself at the table, unfold your napkin and lay it across your 
lap in such a manner that it wiU not sUde off upon the floor; a gentleman should 
place it across his right knee. Do not tuck it into your neck, like a child's bib. 
For an old person, however, it is well to attach the napkin to a napkin hook and 



MISCELLANEO US. 5 47 

slip it into the vest or dress buttonholes, to protect their garments, or sew a 
broad tape at two places on the napkin, and pass it over the head. When the 
soup is eaten, wipe the mouth carefuUy with the napkin, and use it to wipe the 
hands after meals. Finger bowls are not a general institution, and yet they 
seem to be quite as needful as the napkin, for the fingers are also hable to be- 
come a Uttle soUed in eating. They can be had quite cheaply, and should be 
half -filled with water, and placed upon the side table or butler's tray, with the 
dessert, bread and cheese, etc. They are passed to each person half -filled with 
water, placed on a parti-colored napkin with a dessert plate underneath, when 
the dessert is placed upon the table. A leaf or two of sweet verbena, an orange 
flower, or a small slice of lemon, is usually put into each bowl to rub upon the 
fingers. The shce of lemon is most commonly used. The finger tips are slightly 
dipped into the bowl, the lemon juice is squeezed upon them, and then they are 
dried softly upon the napkin. At dinner parties and luncheons they are indis- 
pensable. 

Spoons are sometimes used with firm puddings, but forks are the better style. 
A spoon should never be turned over in the mouth. 

Ladies have frequently an affected way of holding the knife half-way down 
its length, as if it were too big for their httle hands; but this is as awkward a 
way as it is weak; the knife should be grasped freely by the handle only, the 
fore finger being the only one to touch the blade, and that only along the back 
of the blade at its root, and no further down. 

At the conclusion of a course, where they have been used, knife and fork 
should be laid side by side across the middle of the plate — never crossed; the old 
custom of crossing them was in obedience to an ancient rehgious formula. The 
servant should offer everything at the left of the guest, that the guest may be 
at Hberty to use the right hand. If one has been given a napkin ring, it is nec- 
essary to fold one's napkin and use the ring; otherwise the napkin should be 
left unfolded. One's teeth are not to be picked at table; but if it is impossible 
to hinder it, it should be done behind the napkin. One may pick a bone at the 
table, but, as with com, only one hand is allowed to touch it; yet one can usually 
get enough from it with knife and fork, which is certainly the more elegant way 
of doing; and to take her teeth to it gives a lady the look of caring a httle too 
much for the pleasvires of the table; one is, however, on no account to suck one's 
finger after it. 

Wherever there is any doubt as to the best waf lo do a thing, it is wise to 
follow that which is the most rational, and that wiU dmost invariably be found 
to be proper etiquette. To be at ease is a great step towards enjoying your own 



548 MISCELLANEOUS. 

dinner; and making yourself agreeable to the company. There is a reason for 
everything in pohte usage; thus the reason why one does not blow a thing to 
cool it, is not only that it is an inelegant and vulgar action intrinsically, but be- 
cause it may be offensive to others — can not help being so, indeed; and it, 
moreover imphes haste, which, whether from greediness or a desire to get away, 
is equally objectionable. Everything else may be as easily traced to its origin 
in the fit and becoming. 

If, to conclude, one seats one's self properly at table, and takes reason into 
account, one will do tolerably well. One must not pull one's chair too closely 
to the table, for the natural result of that is the inability to use one's knife and 
fork without inconveniencing one's neighbors; the elbows are to be held well in 
and close to one's side, which cannot be done if the chair is too near the board. 
One must not he or lean along the table, nor rest one's arms upon it. Nor is one 
to touch any of the dishes; if a member of the family, one can exercise all the du- 
ties of hospitahty through servants, and wherever there are servants, neither 
family nor guests are to pass or help from any dish. Finally, when rising from 
your chair leave it where it stands.

THE LAYING OF THE TABLE AND THE TREATMENT 

OF GUESTS. 

In giving "dinners," the apparently trifling details are of great importance 
when taken as a whole. 

We gather around our board agreeable persons, and they pay us and our 
dinner the courtesy of dressing for the occasion, and this reunion should be a 
time of profit as weU as pleasiu"e. There are certain estabUshed laws by which 
" dinner giving " is regulated in pohte society; and it may not be amiss to give 
a few observances in relation to them. One of the first is that an invited guest 
should arrive at the house of his host at least a quarter of an hour before the 
time appointed for dinner. In laying the table for dinner all the linen should 
be a spotless white throughout, and underneath the Hnen table-cloth should be 
spread one of thick cotton-flannel or baize, which gives the linen a heavier and 
finer appearance, also deadening the sound of moving dishes. Large and neatly 



MISCELLANEOUS. 549 

folded napkins (ironed without starch), with pieces of bread three or four in- 
ches long, placed between the folds, but not to completely conceal it, are laid on 
each plate. An ornamental centre-piece, or a vase filled with a few rare flow- 
ers, is put on the centre of the table, in place of the large table-castor, which has 
gone into disuse, and is rarely seen now on weU-appointed tables. A few choice 
flowers make a charming variety in the appearance of even the most simply laid 
table, and a pleasing variety at table is quite as essential to the enjoyment of the 
repast as is a good choice of dishes, for the eye in fact should be gratified as 
much as the palate. 

AH dishes should be arranged in harmony with the decorations of the flowers, 
such as covers, rehshes, confectionary, and small sweets. Grarnishing of dishes 
has also a great deal to do with the appearance of a dinner-table, each dish gar- 
nished sufficiently to be in good taste without looking absurd. 

Beside each plate should be laid as many knives, forks, and spoons as will be 
required for the several courses, unless the hostess prefers to have them brought 
on with each change. A glass of water, and when wine is served glasses for it, 
and individual salt-ceUars may be placed at every plate. Water-bottles are now 
much in vogue with corresponding tumblers to cover them; these, accompanied 
with dishes of broken ice, may be arranged in suitable places. When butter is 
served a special knife is used, and that, with all other required service, may be 
left to the judgment and taste of the hostess, in the proper placing of the various 
aids to her guests' comfort. 

The dessert plates should be set ready, each with a doily and a finger-glass 
partly filled with water, in which is dropped a shce of lemon; these, with 
extra knives, forks and spoons, should be on the side-board ready to be placed 
by the guest, between the 0010*868 when required. 

If preferred, the " dinner " may all be served from the side-table, thus reUev- 
ing the host from the task of carving. A plate is set before each guest, and the 
dish carved is presented by the waiter on the left-hand side of each guest. At 
the end of each coiu^e the plates give way for those of the next. If not served 
from the side-table, the dishes are brought in ready carved, and placed before 
the host and hostess, then served and placed upon the waiter's salver, to be laid 
by that attendant before the guest. 

Soup and fish being the first course, plates of soup are usually placed on the 
table before the dinner is announced; or if the hostess wishes the soup served at 
the table, the soup-tureen, containing Imt soup, and the warm soup-plates are 
placed before the seat of the hostess. Soup and fish being disposed of, then 
com/' the joints or roasts, entries (made dishes), poultry, etc., also relishes. 



550 MISCELLANEOUS. 

After dishes have been passed that are required no more, such as vegetables, 
hot sauces, etc., the dishes containing them may be set upon the side-board, ready 
to be taken away. 

Jellies and sauces, when not to be eaten as a dessert, should be helped on the 
dinner-plate, not on a small side dish as was the former usage. 

If a dish be on the table, some parts of which are preferred to others, accord 
ing to the taste of the individuals, aU should have the opportunity of choice. 
The host wiU simply ask each one if he has any preference for a particular part; 
if he replies in the negative, you are not to repeat the question, nor insist that 
he must have a preference. 

Do not attempt to eulogize yoin" dishes, or apologize that you cannot recom- 
mend them, — this is extreme bad taste; as also is the vauntiag of the excellence 
of your wines, etc., etc. ' 

Do not insist upon your guests partaking of particular dishes. Do not ask 
persons more than once, and never force a supply upon their plates. It is iU- 
bred, though common, to press any one to eat; and moreover, it is a great an- 
noyance to many. 

In winter, plates should always be warmed, but not made hot. Two kinds 
of animal food, or two kinds of dessert, should not be eaten off of one plate, and 
there should never be more than two kinds of vegetables with one course. As- 
paragus, green com, cauliflower and raw tomatoes, comprise one course in place 
of a salad. AU meats should be cut across the grain in very thin sUces. Fish, 
at dinner, should be baked or boiled, never fried or broiled. Baked ham may 
be used in every com-se after fish, shced thin and handed after the regular course 
is disposed of. 

The hostess should retain her plate, knife and fork, until her guests have fin- 
ished. 

The crumb-brush is not used, until the preparation for bringing in the des- 
sert; then all the glasses are removed, except the flowers, the water-tumblers, 
and the glass of wine which the guest wishes to retain with his dessert. The des- 
sert plate containing the finger-bowl, also a dessert knife and fork, should then 
be set before each guest, who at once removed the finger-bowl and its doily, and 
the knife and fork to the table, leaving the plate ready to be used for any des- 
sert chosen. 

Finely sifted sugar should always be placed upon the table to be used with 
puddings, pies, fruit, etc., and if cream is required, let it stand by the dish it is 
to be served with. 

To la^" a dessert for a gmaU entertainment, and a few guests outside of the 



MISCELLANEO US. 551 

family, it may consist simply of two dishes of fresh fruit in season, two of dried 
fruits and two each of cakes and nuts. 

Coffee and tea are served lastly, poured into tiny cups and served clear, 
passed around on a tray to each guest, then the sugar and cream passed, that 
each person may be allowed to season his black coffee or caf& noir to suit himr 
self. 

A. family dinner, even with a few friends, can be made quite attractive and 
satisfactory without much display or expense; consisting first of good soup, then 
fish garnished with suitable additions, followed by a roast; then vegetables and 
some made dishes, a salad, crackers, cheese and ohves, then dessert. This sen- 
sible meal, well-cooked and neatly served, is pleasing to almost any one, and is 
within the means of any housekeeper in ordinary circimistances.
