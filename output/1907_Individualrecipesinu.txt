quarter teaspoonful salt in one cup of 
water when the vegetables are partially 
cooked. The water in which vegetables 
are cooked is called vegetable stock. 

Fresh green vegetables require less 
water than others. 

Cabbage, cauliflower, onions and tur- 
nips should be cooked uncovered in a 
large amount of water. 

All vegetables must be drained as 
soon as tender. Season with salt and 
pepper and serve hot with butter or 
sauce. 

The color may be kept in green veg- 
etables, as spinach, by pouring cold 
water through them after draining.

again reached.

Ice 

GENERAL RULES. 

A pint freezer may be used or the 
following utensils may be substituted: 
a half pound baking-powder can, a 
wooden spoon, a bowl or a small 
wooden tub to form outside of freezer. 
The tin can should be soldered to make 
it water tight. 

The ice must be broken into fine 
pieces and mixed with the rock salt; 
use three times as much ice as salt for 
freezing. Pour the mixture which is 
to be frozen into the can. Surround 
the can with ice and salt, beat the 
mixture, and as it freezes scrape from 
the sides of the can with a wooden 
spoon; cover and turn can back and 
forth, scraping from the bottom and 
sides every five minutes. When it is 
frozen throughout, beat well, and pack 
in a smaller can or ice cream mould, if 
desired. Place a small strip of mus- 
lin dipped in melted butter around the 
outside of the cover, to keep out salt, 
and pack with ice and salt, covering the 
can completely. Be careful to drain off 
all the water if ice melts while the 
mould is standing in it; the ice cream 
should stand at least an hour before 
using. In serving, wash salt from the 
mould with cold water, wipe, remove 
cover and slip a knife around the inner 
edge of the mould, and invert the 
mould over serving plate.

Mixtures withj'BaJdng 
Powder. 

Pastry flour should be used, if pos- 
sible. Sift flour before it is measured; 
then mix and sift dry ingredients. 

The eggs are beaten whole and the 
milk added to them, then added to the 
dry ingredients. When fat is used it is 
usually melted and added last, but may 
be worked into the flour with the tips 
of the fingers, or cut in with a knife. 

The pans or muffin rings should be 
greased before the mixture is prepared. 
Iron gem-pans must be heated. 

The oven must be ready for baking 
before mixtures are prepared; they 
must be put into the oven as soon as 
prepared and baked from twelve to 
thirty minutes. In a coal range bake 
them first on the floor of the oven and 
raise them to the shelf to brown; in a 
gas range bake them on a shelf in the 
centre of the oven.

slightly floured board and roll them out 
gently with a rolling-pin and cut into

tened with a little milk. Bake 12 to 
15 minutes.

GRIDDLE CAKES. 

In making griddle cakes or waffles 
the griddle or waffle-iron must be hot 
and thoroughly greased. Butter, but- 
terine, or salt pork may be used for 
this purpose. 

Pastry flour is best for these mix- 
tures, but if bread flour is used the 
amount should be decreased. 

They should be baked as soon as 
mixed.
