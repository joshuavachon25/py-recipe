The argument that the consumer will save in the purchase of such poisonous stuff, the cost of can^^

HINTS OM BAKING. 



O ACHIEVE PERFECT SUCCESS, the cook must use judgment and care. Some flour 
requires more water, or milk, than others ; so tliat the quantity may have to be varied 
to make dough of a proper consistency. Different bakings will vary as to time and 
heat required, and should, therefore, be examined occasionally. To ascertain whether 
the l)read is sufficiently done in center of the loaf or cake, thrust a clean straw or long 
thin splinter into it. If done, there will be no dough on it when drawn out. Measure 
the tlour, and be careful to mix with it the baking powder in a dry state, and before 
sifting. You can always substitute water for uiilk, or milk for water ; butter for lard, or lard for 
butter. The number of eggs may be increased, diminished, or dispensed with entirely. Where fewer 
eggs are used than directed, always use a little more baking powder. Never use sour milk. 

Heat the bread knife very hot when about to cut new bread ; this will prevent its crumbling. 

CAKE BAKING. —For a plain cake made with one pound of flom-. Royal Baking Powder, etc., 
the time to be allowed in baking would be from -JO to 50 minutes ; at the outside not more than one 
horn-. Very I'ich cakes, in which butin- and i'.:;.4.s predominate, take, of com-se, very much lougertime 
to bake, a fjouud cake taking froni I'.j lo -3 Imhus. and a brides cake SJ^g. On no account should an 
oven be too hot when the cake is put fn tliat i-. liot enough to brown at once ; if so, in 5 minutes the 
whole outside will be burned and the inti'iiOr ^\ill stand little chance of being baked. The old plan of 
feeling the handle of the oven door to test the heat is not always successful ; it is better to sprinkle a 
little tloiu- inside and shut the door for about 3 minutes : if at the end of that time it is of a rich light 
brown, the cake may be put in, but if bm-ned the heat must be lessened. 

In baking loaf cake, remember that unless you place a piece of paper over for protection at first, 
a top crust will be fonned at once that prevents the raising. When cake is well raised remove paper 
for browning on top. 

ADVICE TO THE COOK. — Great cleanliness, as well as care and attention, are required from a 
cook. Keep yom- hands very clean ; try to prevent your nails from getting black and discolored ; 
don't " scatter "' in your kitchen, clean up as you go, put scalding water into each saucepan or stewpan 
as you finish using it. Diy yom* saucepans before you put them on the shelf. Never scrub inside of 
a fryingpan ; rub it with wet silver-sand, rinse it out well with hot water afterwards. Wash your 
pudding-cloths, scald and hang them to dry directly after using them ; air them before you put them 
away, or they will be musty ; keep in diy place. Be careful not to use a knife that has cut onions till 
it has been cleaned. Keep sink and sink-brush very clean ; be careful never to throw anything but 
water down sink. Do notthrow cabbage water down it — throw it away ovit of doors, its smell is very 
bad. Never have sticky plates or dishes ; use very hot water for wasliiug them ; w lien f,'ivasy, change 
it. Clean coppers with turpentine and fine brickdust, rubbed on with ilaiinel. jMilisli tliem « ith leather 
and a little dry brickdust. Clean your tins with soap and whiting mi.\;ed, made into a tliick cream 
with hot water. Rub it on with flannel ; when dry, whisk it off with clean leather and diy whiting. 
Take care that you look at the meat the butcher brings, to see that it is good. Let there be no waste 
in the kitchen.

Pastry. 



Hints on Pastry. 

Flour.— Should always be sifted just before you 
wish to use it. 

Royal Baking Powder. — Should be thoroughly 
mixed with the flour dry. 

Butter and Sugar for Cake.— Should always 
be beaten to a cream. 

Eggs. — Beat yelks until you can take up a 
spoonful ; whip whites to stiff froth, and stir them 
into cake with the flour the last thing before put 
ting cake into tius. 

To Boil a Pudding in a Bag.— Dip bag ( which 
should be made of thick cotton or linen ) in hot 
water, and rub the inside with flour before putting 
in the pudding ; when done dip bag in cold water 
and the pudding will turnout easily. Always put 
a plate on bottom of kettle to keep pudding from 
burning. 

To Steam a Pudding.— Put it into tin pan or 
earthen dish, tie a cloth over top and set it into a 
steamer ; cover the steamer closely; allow a little 
longer time than you do for boiling. 

To Make Crust foh Pies, Tarts and Puddings. 
— Make pastry with clean, cold hands. Dip your 
hands in cold water ( after washing them in hot 
water ) before you begin, or your crust will not be 
good. Crust for company or the master's table is 
made with butter : for home or the servants, of 
clarified di-ipping or lard. Look to the oven ; if it 
is too cold it will make your cmst heavy, if too 
hot it will burn it. Try it, by baking a tiny piece 
of crust in it first. Make a little hole in top crust 
of meat pies to let out gas. 

Apple sauce, ready for table use or pies, may be 
preserved by putting in hot jars and sealing at 
once. Remember cold fruit requires cold jars, 
hot fruit hot jars.

take a spoonful up clear from strings. To ascer- 
tain whether a cake is baked enough, pass a small 
knife-blade through it ; if not done enough, some

them. Cook until tender ; after you fill the crust 
you can put raisins in so that about same number 
will come in each piece. Then, if you wet the 
edges of the crust so that no juice can escape, you 
will never know by the taste that the raisins were 
not cooked with the mince-meat.

Custards, Tarts, Etc. 

i^ta^USTARDS require to be made carefully, 
\r§, and need not, imless occasion demands it, be 
\M. made expensively. The plain boiled custard, 
usually served in with tarts or puddings, may be 
cheaply prepared. 

Custards may have the delicate flavors of 
lemon, orange, rose, vanilla, nutmeg, etc., com- 
municated to them by using Royal Flavoring Ex- 
tracts. A few drops of Ro»e will answer where a 
teaspoonful or two of Vanilla would be required. 
By their use you avoid the necessity of straining 
the custard ; flavor should be used after boiling 
it to save driving off the fine aroma by the heat. 

Banana Custard. — Make a white custard as 
follows : 2 tablespoonfuls corn starch, wetted 
with enough cold water to dissolve it ; 1 cup 
granulated sugar, ]^ cup butter ; stir together in 
a pudding mould or earthen dish, and pour on 
enough boiling water to make thick custard ; beat 
the whites of three eggs to snow, stir into the cus- 
tard, and set it in the oven to bake for 15 minutes, 
or for the same length of time in a pot of boiling 
water ; set aside until perfectly cold ; then 
remove the slight cvust that will have formed on 
top ; have ready dish in which you are to serve 
your custard, and some fresh ripe "bananas, minced 
finely ; mix with the custard and pour into the 
dish and add a meringue made of the beaten whites 
of 3 eggs, and 1^ teacupf ul of pulverized pink sugar. 
A fine custard may be made according to above 
receipt by using peaches, instead of bananas, or 
Bartlett pears. Milk should never be used with 
acid fruits, particularly in warm weather, and 
pm'e cream in any quantity is a severe tax on a 
weak stomach. The custai-ds for which fornnilas 
are given here can be made thus as real cream, 
answer the same purpose, are quite as palatable 
in most cases as the ordinary milk and cream, 
without danger of being curdled by the acidity of 
the fruit. Tapioca, arrowroot, etc., may be sub- 
stituted for corn starch in the making of these 
custards, and pineapples, straw t erries, rasp- 
berries, are delicious served in this way. Custards 
with an extra allowance of butter and a flavoring 
of Royal Extract Vanilla, Almond or Rose, make 
delicious cream pies. Bake with either 1 or 2 
crusts of rich puff paste. If the former, add a 



meringue. By using the yelks as well as the 
whites of eggs, and using the grated rind and juice 
of lemons and oranges, or both, delicious orange 
and lemon pies are made. These shoidd be made 
with only one crust. 

Banana Pie is made by using a white custard 
as above, and mixing with the pulp of ripe ban- 
anas, pressed through a colander or sieve, and 
baked in a rich open pastry crust, and finished 
with a meringue. 

Chocolate Custards. — Pour 2 tablespoonfuls 
of boiling water over 2 ounces of grated choco- 
late ; let it stand near the fire till perfectly dis- 
solved. Put into pint of milk mixed with pint of 
cream, pinch of salt, and three ounces of sugar, 
simmer over fire 10 minutes ; then add by degrees 
yelks of 8 well-beaten eggs, and stir to a froth 
while it thickens ; then pour out to cool. 

Plain Boiled Custard. — 1 quart of milk, 8 
eggs, peel of 1 large lemon, 3 laurel leaves, 14 
pound of loaf sugar. Pour milk into clean sauce- 
l)au with lam-el leaves and peel of lemon, set at 
side of fire 20 minutes, when on point of boiling- 
strain into basin to cool ; then .stir in powdered 
sugar and well-beaten eggs ; again strain it into a 
jug, which place in deep saucepan of boiling- 
water, and stir one way until it thickens ; then- 
pour into glass dish or custard cups. 

Vanilla Custard- — Boil 1 pint of cream with 
4 ounces of sugar, for 14 of an hour, then strain 
through muslin. Beat well yelks of 6 eggs, and 
pour milk over them into a bowl, placing bowl 
over pan of boiling water, and stirring rapidly till 
it thickens. Let it cool gradually ; add 1 teaspoon- 
ful Royal Extract Vanilla to suit taste, and stir 
continually. AVhen cold serve in dish, covered

their stalks, or pare and quarter the apples; put 
them into pie-dish with sugar, line edge of dish 
with paste, pour in a little water, put on cover, 
ornament edge of paste in the usual manner, and

loosens from the dish. Line shallow tin dish with 
puff paste, put in the jam, roll out some of pa.ste, 
wetit lightly with yelk of an egg beaten with a 
little milk, and a tablespoonful of powdered sugar. 
Cut it in very narrow stnps, then lay them across 
ihe tart, lay another strip round the edge, trim off 
outside, and bake in quick oven. 

Charlotte Russe. — 2 tablespoonfuls gelatine 
soaked in a little cold milk 2 hours ; two coffee- 
cups rich cream ; one teacup milk. Whip cream

not sugar them in dish — they then become pre- 
serves, not fresh fruit. Pass the powdered sugar 
and cream with them.

THE ROYAL BAKER AND PASTRY COOK 



Apple MeringTie. — Spice and sweeten apple 
sauce ; beat in 3 or 3 eggs. Pour into pudding dish, 
bake quickly. When well crusted over, cover with 
meringue made by whipping whites of 3 eggs with 
a little sugar. Shut oven door and tinge slightly. 

Meriugnies. — Whisk the whites of 4 eggs to 
high froth, then stir into it J^ pound finely pow- 
dered sugar; flavor with Royal Extract Vanilla ov 
Lemon, repeat whisking until it will lie in a heap, 
then lay mixture on letter paper, in a shape of 
half an egg, moulding it with a spoon, laying 
each about half an inch apart. Then place paper 
containing meringues on piece of hard wood, put 
them into quick oven, do not close it, watch them ; 
when they begin to have yellow appearance, take 
out. Remove paper carefully from wood, let them 
cool for 2 or 3 miimtes, then slip thin knife very 
carefully under one, turn it into your left hand, 
take another from paper in same way, join two 
sides which were next the paper together. The 
soft inside may be taken out with handle of small 
spoon, the shells filled with jam, jelly or cream, 
then joined together as above, cementing them 
with some of the mixture. 

Iced Fruits for Desserts. — Any desirable 
fruit may be easily iced by dipping first in the 
beaten white of an egg, then in sugar finely pul- 
verized, and again in egg, and so on until you 
have the icing of the desired thickness. For this 
purpose oranges or lemons should be carefully 
pared, and all the white inner skin removed that 
IS possible, to prevent bitterness ; then cut either 
in thin horizontal slices if lemons, or in quarters 
if oranges. For cherries, strawberries, currants, 
etc., choose the largest and finest, leaving stems 
out. Peaches should be pared and cut in halves, 
and sweet juicy pears may be treated in the same 
way, or look nicely when pared, leaving on the 
stems, and iced. Pineapples should be cut in thin 
slices, and these again divided into quarters.

Preserves. 



sSiilRECTIONS FOR PRESERVING 
aWW, FRUTT. — Preserves should be kept care- 
fi?b#^ fully from air, in very dry place ; if they 
stand in warm place they will mould. They 
should be looked at 2 or 3 times in first 2 months, 
that they may be gently boiled again if not Ukely 
to keep. It is supposed by some that cheap sugar 
will do for preserves ; this is a mistaken idea ; the 
very best sugar should be used ; if elieap sugar is 
used, it should be cleansed and skum all taken off.

Fish. 



ilUlRECTIONS FOR COOKING. - Clean 
almwl y^"'' ^^^ carefully, slit it low enough so as 
<^i^ not to have any blood on the backbone, but 
do not make too large a cut so as to spoil look of 
fish. The sound adheres to bone, and must be 
U'ft, so must the hard and soft roes ; care must 
lie- taken not to break liver, which in most fish is 
leijlaced : great care must be taken not to break 
gal!, for it would make fish bitter. Never fry fish 
in butter ; f i-y them in good dinpptng or lard — oil 
is best, but it is very expensive. 



- Clean, wash, and wipe dry. 
"Ibe 



To Broil Fish. 

Split, so that when laid flat, the backbone will 
in the middle. Sprinkle with salt and lay, inside 
down, upon a buttered gridiron over a clear fire

over it cup of drawn butter based upon the liquor 
in which fish was boiled, with juice of ^ lemon 
stu-red into it. 

Baked Fish. — A fish weighing from 4 to e 
pounds is good size to bake. It should be cooked 
whole to look weU. Make dressing of bread 
crumbs, butter, salt, and a little salt pork chopped 
fine (parsley and onions, if you please) ; mix this 
with 1 egg. Fill the body, sew it up, lay in large 
dripper ; put across it some strips of salt pork to

Cream Gbavy fob Baked Fish. — Have ready in 
saucepan 1 cup cream, diluted with a few spoon- 
fuls hot water ; stir in carefully 2 tablespoonfuls 
melted butter and a little chopped parsley ; heat 
this in ves.sel filled with hot water Pom* in gravy 
from dripping pan of fish. Boil thick. 

Broiled Salt Mackerel.— Fieshen by soaking 
it over night in water, taking care that the skin 
lies uppermost. In the morning dry it without 
breaking, cut off the head and tip of the tail, place 
it between the bars of a buttered fish gridiron, and 
broil to a hght brown ; lay it on a hot dish, and 
dress with a little butter, pepper and lemon juice, 
vinegar, or choiiped i)iokle. 

Broiled Salt Salmon or Other Salt Fish. 
— Soak salmon in te|jid or cold water 24 hours, 
changing water seveial times, or let stand under 
faucet of running water. If in a hurry or desir- 
ing a very salt reUsh, it may do to soak short 
time, having water warm, and changing, parboil- 
ing slightly. At the hour wanted, broil sharply. 
Season to suit taste, covering with butter. This 
receipt will answer for all kinds of salt fish. (For 
Salmon Sauce see Sauces.) 

Broiled Halibut. — Slices of halibut, salt, 
pepper, butter. Cut the slices of fish about an 
inch thick, season with pepper and salt, and lay 
them in melted butter i^ hour, allowing 3 table- 
spoonfuls of butter to a pound of fish, then roll 
them in flour, and broil about SO minutes. Serve 
very hot.

in good season from September to June, and should 
be purchased alive and plunged into boiling water 
in which a good proportion of salt has been mixed. 
Continue to boil, according to size, from 20 min- 
utes to an hour. Crabs should be boiled in the 
same manner, but a little more than half the time

soning into saucepan ; when it simmers add lob- 
ster. Cook slowly, covered, y^ hour, stirring oc- 
casionally. Turn into deep dish, and garnish 
with slices of egg. 

Lobster Pates. — Make puff paste and spread 
on very deep pat6-pans. Bake it empty. Having 
boiled well 2 or 3 flne lobsters, extract all the 
meat and mince very small, mixing it with coral 
smoothly mashed and yelk of hard-boiled egg, 
grated. Season with a little salt, cayenne, and 
powdei-ed mace or nutmeg, adding a little yellow 
lemon rind, grated. Moisten mixture well with 
cream, fresh Dutter, or salad oil. Put it into stew- 
pan, add very little water, let stew till it just 
comes to a boil. Take off the fli-e, and the pat6s 
being baked, remove them from tin pans, place 
them on large dish, and flll them up to top with 
the mixture. Similar pat§s may be made of 
prawns or crabs. 



Meats. 



Broiling. — The rules for roasting meat apply 
to broiling, except that instead of cooking it in 
the oven it is to be quickly browned first on one

side and then on the other, over a hot Are, and 
removed a little from the fire to finish cooking. 
Meat an inch thick will broil in about 20 minutes. 
It should be seasoned after it is cooked. 

Boiling and Stewing. — Fresh meat for boiling 
should be put into boiling water and boiled very 
gently about 20 minutes tor each pound. A little 
salt, spice or vegetables may be boiled in the 
water with the meat for seasoning. A little vine- 
gar put in the water with tough meat makes it 
tender. The broth of boiled meat should always 
be saved to use in soups, stews and gravies. Stew- 
ing and simmering meats mean to place them 
near enough to the fire to keep the water on them 
bubbling moderately, constantly and slowly. Salt 
meats should be put over the fire in cold water, 
and that as soon as it boils should be replaced by 
fresh cold water, the water to be changed until it 
remains fresh enough to give the meat a palatable 
flavor when done. Salted and smoked meat.s 
require about .30 minutes very slow boiling, from 
the time the water boils, to each pound. Vegeta- 
bles and herbs may be boiled with them to flavor 
them. When they are cooked the vessel contain- 
ing them should be set where they will keep hot 
without boiling until required if they are to be 
served hot ; if they are to be served cold they 
should be allowed to cool in the pot liquor in 
which tliey were boiled. Very salt meats, or those 
much dried in smoking, should be soaked over 
night in cold water before boiling. 

Frying. — There are two distinct methods of 
frying, one with very little fat in the pan. To 
practice this successfully, the pan and fat must 
be hot before the article to be fried is put into it : 
for instance, in frying chops, if the pan is hot, and 
only fat enough is used to keep the chops from 
sticking to it, the heat being maintained so that 
the chops cook quickly, they will be nearly as nice 
as if they were broiled. Frying by the other 
method consists in entirely immersing the article 
to be cooked in sufficient smoking hot fat to cover 
it, and keeping the fat at that degree of heat until 
the food is brown. It should then be taken uj) 
with a skimmer and laid upon brown paper for a 
moment to free it from grease. 



^^READED MUTTON CHOPS. -Trim 

53^^ neatly, cut off all fat and skin, roll in 
'W^^ beaten egg, then in cracker crumbs, and 
fry ih hot dripping. Turn as the under side 
browns, drain and serve. 

Roast Beef. — Rib roast is best. Have butcher 
saw off about ^ bone. Cut ends of ribs clear of 
meat ; fold flap neatly around to thick part, and 
secure with skewers. The trimmings are yours. 
As meat is weighed first, take it all — will make 
good material for soup or gravy. Put beef in 
dripping pan ; pour cup of boiling water over it. 
Rub a little salt into fat parts : roast 10 minutes 
for every pound. Bake soon as juice begins to 
flow. If meat has much fat on top cover fatty 
portion with paste made of flour and water. When 
nearly done remove this, dredge beef with flour ; 
baste well with gravy. Sprinkle salt over top and 
serve. Pour fat from gravy, retui-n to fu-e, thicken 
with browned gravy, season and boil up once. 
Roast most all other meats in same way. 

To Roast a Sirloin of Beef.— Time, 14 of 
an horn- to each 1 pound of meat. Make up good 
flre ; spit or hang joint evenly at short distance 
from it ; put a Tittle clarified dripping in pan, 
baste the joint well soon asitis put down to dress; 
baste again every },^ of an hour till about 20 min- 
utes before it is done ; then stir flre and make it 
clear ; sprinkle a little salt, dredge a little flom- 
over the meat, turn again till it is brown and 
frothed. Take from the spit, put on hot dish, pour 
over it some well made gravy, or mix the gravy 
left at bottom of dripping pan with a little hot 
water, and pour it over it. Garnish with fine scrap- 
ings of horse-radish in little heaps. Serve York- 
shire pudding with it on separate dish. 



Beefs Tongrue. — Wash a large perfectly fresh 
tongue in 3 waters ; then cover well with boiling 
water, a little salt, and cook about 12 minutes to 
the pound. Strip off the skin. Dish when you 
have trimmed away the root, and pour over fol- 
lowing sauce : Strain cup of the liquor in which 
tongue was boiled ; set over flre, and stir in 2 
tablespoonfuls butter cut up in flour, pepper to 
tast«, the juice of 1 lemon, and when this has 
thickened, 2 small pickled cucumbers chopped, 
and serve. 

Beefsteak Pie (French Style).— Take a 
nice piece of beef, rump or sirloin, cut in small 
slices ; slice also a little raw ham ; put both in a 
frying-pan, with some butter and small quantity 
chopped onions; let them simmer together a short 
time on the fli-e or in the oven ; add a little flour 
and enough stock to make sauce ; salt, pepper, 
chopped parsley and a little Worcestershire sauce 
as seasoning ; add also a few sliced potatoes, and 
cook together for about 20 minutes ; put this into 
a pie-dish, with a few slices of hard boiled eggs 
on the top, and cover with a layer of common 
paste. Bake from 15 to 20 minutes in a well heated 
oven. All dark meat pies can be treated precisely 
the same way. If poultry, leave the potatoes out. 

Beefsteak Pudding No. l.—Pasie No. 2. 
214 pounds round steak, 1 level teaspoonful each 
Royal celery salt. Royal thyme, and marjoram, 1 
small onion, salt and white pepper to taste, 4 
sprigs parsley. Line well buttered pudding mould 
with the jiaste, wet edges, make layer of beef, cut 
in neat sea IIcj] is, sprinkle with onion and parsley 
minced very line, mixed on plate with celery salt, 
thyme, maijorani, salt, and pepper; then another 
layer of beef, and seasoning, and so on until each 
is used : fill up with cold water, cover it in with 
paste, place buttered paper over, set in saucepan 
with boiling water to reach two-thirds up outside 
of moidd ; steam thus 2}^ hours, turn carefulh- 
out on dish, pour over it gravy that may be at 
hand, made hot and flavored with any kind of 
Sauce Piquaiite. 

Broiled Steak. — Time, 8 to 10 minutes. Rump 
steak, 1 ounce butter, pepper and salt. Rump 
steak is best for broiling and frying ; beef steak 
for stewing. Have steak cut about % or 14 i^^h 
in thickness ; place gridu-on over clear fire and 
rub bars with fat. Place stea.k on it and broil, 
turning trequently, care fully pricking fork through 
fat. for if steak itself is pricked gravy will run out. 
and it will harden. Have ready hot dish on which 
you have placed lump of butter size of large wal- 
nut, catsup, pepper and salt. Lay steak (rubbing 
lightly over with butter) on dish; serve quickly as 
possible. 

Braised Beef. — Put piece beef flUet without 
bone, weighing 5 or 6 pounds, in a pot. Scatter 
sliced onions over it, salt slightly, and if you have 
any good gravy add it to the cup of boiling water 
you pour over the meat. Cover lightly ; cook 
slowly 1]4 hours. Add more boiling water should 
gravy sink too low. When done dredge with flour ; 
set in a hot oven. As the flour browns baste with 
butter to glaze. It should not remain longer in 
oven than ten minutes. Strain the gravy ; pour 
on the fat; put into saucepan with a little browned 
flotu" and a tablespoonful of catsup. Boil until 
thickened, pour few teaspoonfuls over the meat, 
and serve rest in a boat. 

To Mince Beef. — Shred the underdone part 
fine, with some of the fat; put it into a small stew- 
pan,. with some onions (a very little will do), a lit- 
tle water, pepper and salt. Boil it till the onion 
is quite soft, and then put some of the gravy of 
the meat to it, and the miace. Do not let it boil. 
Have a small hot dish with bits of bread ready, 
and pour the mince into it, but fli-st mix a large 
spoonful of vinegar with it. 

Bacon and "Eggs. — Cut bacon in thin slices 
and fry it. When bacon is done fry eggs in same 
pan. Break each egg separately in a cup, then 
throw quickly into pan. Lay fried egg on each 
slice of bacon.

THE ROTAL BAKER AND PASTRY COOK. 



Broiled Beefsteak. — Flatten with the broad 
side of a hatchet, aad broil upon a buttered grid- 
iron over a clear fire; lay upou ahot dish, pepper, 
salt, and put a large spoonful butter cut in small 
bits upon it. Cover with a hot dish for 5 minutes 
before it is t-arvcd. 

Broiled Ham and Poached Egg-s. — Cut 
slices of iidiled luun of equal size; broil on a grid- 
iron over a clpar fire; lay on a hot dish. Lay on 
each a poached egg, neatly trimmed, and serve. 

To Boil a Ham. —Time 4 or 5 hours. A blade 
of mace, a few cloves, a sprig of thyme, and 2 bay 
leaves. Well soak ham in large quantity of water 
for 24 houi-s, then trim and scrape very clean ; put 
into large stewpan, with more than sufficient 
water to cover it; put in mace, cloves, thyme, and 
bay leaves. Boil for 4 or 5 hours, according to 
weight ; when done, let it become cold in liquor 
in which it was boiled. Then remove rind care- 
fully, without injuring the fat; press cloth over it 
to absorb as much of the grease as possible; shake 
some bread-raspings over the fat. Serve cold gar- 
nished with parsley. Ornament knuckle with 
paper frill. 

Boiled Ham. — Boil it 3 or 4 hours, according 
to size, then skin the whole and fit it for the table ; 
then set in oven for }4 an hour, cover thickly with 
pounded rusk or bread crumbs, set back for ^4 au 
hour longer. Boiled ham is always improved by 
setting in an o en for nearly an hour, till much of 
the fat dries out, and it alfso makes it more tender. 
Boiled Corned Beef and Turnips.— Select 
a piece not too salt. The bii.sket is a good cut for 
family use when not too fat. Cook beef in plenty 
cold water. Bring slowly to boil. Cook 18 minutes 
to the pound after it begins to simmer. When 
fully % done put in a dozen turnips, peeled and 
quartered. When both beef and turnips are 
thoroughly done dish out the beef, and lay the 
tm-nips unmashed about it. Serve with drawn 
butter, having as a base the pot liquor. Remain- 
ing liquor will make a good soup for next day's 
dinner. 

Boiled Pigs Feet.— Wash 12 pigs feet clean, 
Ijlace in deep pan, and pour scalding water over 
them; take them out, light piece paper and burn 
hair off each one iu same manner as a fowl is 
cleaned, then place them in w arm water ; boil 
slowly 114 hours, or until tender ; then put them 
in vinegar, let simmer very slowly for another J^ 
hour ; fill small mushn bag with equal portions of 
cloves and allspice, bag to be size of an egg, tie 
up and drop in the pig's feet and vinegar ; let all 
boil up for 10 minutes, salt to taste. 

Boiled Mutton. — Put on in plenty of boiling 
water, salted; cook 12 minutes to the pound; take 
out, wipe carefully with a hot wet cloth; butter 
all over, and serve with a cup of drawn butter sent 
up in sauceboat. 

Croquettes of Sweetbreads. — Blanch and 
braize 1 dozen sweetbreads. When cooked, cut 
them in small square pieces, also 14 can of mush 
rooms. Put in saucepan to cook, 2 finely chopped 
shalots or garlic with piece of butter ; add some 
Allemande sauce, reduce it, then add sweetbreads 
and mushrooms. Season with salt, pepper, nut- 
meg and a little chopped parsley, add the yelks of 
2 eggs, stir well, then put in pan to cool. Shape 
them in any desired form: bread them with bread 
crumbs, fry in hot lard. Serve with mushroom or 
cream sauce. You may add beef tongues or truf- 
rtes, cut in small squares. 

mutton Chops Broiled. —Cut some chops 
from the best end of the loin or neck, trim them 
neatly, removing the skin or fat, leaving only 
enough of the latter to make them palatable. 
Place the chops on a gridiron over a very clear 
lire; turn them frequeutly, taking care that the 
fork is not put into the lean part of the chops. 
Season them with pepper and salt. When done 
put a piece of fresh butter over each chop, and 
send them to the table on a hot dish. Pork chops 
are cooked in the same manner. Time, 10 min- 
utes. 



Elk or Venison Steak. — Beat and prepare 
steak. Have ready 2 or 3 slices of breakfast bacon. 
Put steak on very hot f rymg-pan. Lay slices of 
bacon on t op. AVhen brown turn, and continue to do 
so until done to taate. Pepper, salt, and serve hot. 

Lamh Cutlets. —Trim carefully; lay in a lit- 
tle warm butter for an hour, turning several times; 
then broil on a greased gridiron, taking care they 
do not drip; butter, pepper and salt each, lay iu 
circle on plate, and serve. 

Liver and Bacon. — 3 lbs. fresh hver, 1 lb. 
streaked bacon, juice of one lemon, one table- 
spoonful each flour and butter, 1 onion, and pep- 
per and salt. Soak liver in cold water 20 minutes, 
wipe dry and cut in medium strips. Cut as 
many very thin strips of bacon and fry the bacon 
3 minutes in its own fat. Salt, pepper and dredge 
the liver in flour before it goes in. When it is 
done lay in two rows the length of dish, with a 
strip of bacon between each piece of liver. Strain 
the fat, and return to the pan with a cupful of hot 
water, the butter rubbed into the flour, and when 
it has boiled up the juice of lemon; pour over the 
liver. Pass mustard with this dish. 

Leg of Mutton Roasted. — Time, M hour or 
20 minutes to each pound. A leg of mutton in- 
tended for roasting can be kept much longer than 
for boiling, but must be wiped very diy, and 
dusted with flour and pepper. Cutoff knuckle, 
remove thick skin, and trim off piece of thick 
flank. Put a little salt and water into dripping- 
pan, baste joint for short time with it, then use 
gravy from meat itself, basting every 10 minutes. 
Serve with gravy poured round it. The wether leg 
of mutton is best for roasting. A leg of mutton, 
if too large, can be divided, and knuckle boiled. 
By placing a paste of flour and water over part 
cut off, to keep in gravy, it can be roasted, by 
which means two roast dinners can be had from 
one joint. 

Mutton Chops, Larded.— Trim off superflu- 
ous fat and skiti, beat each chop flat, and lard 
each with strips of fat salt pork, drawn quite 
through so as to protect both sides of the chop. 
Put into saucepan, sprinkle with minced onion, 
pepper and parsley, and barely cover with any 
weak broth you may chance to have. Put on the 
saucepan lid ; set it where it will not boil under 1 
hour. Then increase heat and simmer I/3 hour, or 
until tender. Take up the chops and keep hot. 
Thicken gravy with browned flour, add juice of 1 
lemon, 1 large spoonful mushroom catsup, 1 glass 
sherry wine and stn- 1 minute. Put back the 
chops and heat to a weak boil. Lay chops on 
dish, pour over the gravy and serve. 

Pigeon Pie. — Clean, wash, and cut pigeons 
into quarters, wipe dry, and fry lightly in butter 
or dripping. Sprinkle well with salt and pepper. 
Have ready a greased pudding-dish and a good 
paste. Lay some pieces of pigeon in the bottom 
of the dish, and cover with a mixtm-e of chopped 
eggs and the giblets boiled tender in a little water 
and then minced. More pigeon and another layer 
of the force-meat. Stir 2 tablespoonf uls of butter, 
rolled in flour, into the hot water in which the 
giblets were boiled. Season and pour enough into 
the pie to half cover the birds. Cover with a thick 
crust with slit in middle. Bake in 1 hour if pie be 
of fair size. Glaze with beaten egg just before it 
is taken from oven. 

Roast Rabbits. — Skin and clean with gi-eat 
care, and wash a pair of fat rabbits (or hares), 
stuff with a force-meat of crumbs and chopped fat 
pork, seasoned with onion, thyme, pepper and 
salt. Sew up with flue thread, bind the legs to the 
body in a kneeling posture, and place in dripping 
pan. Povir over them 1 cupful boiling water, and 
invert another pan over them to keep them in. 
Baste with butter twice, with their own gravy 
twice, and twice again with butter. Just before 
you take them up dredge with flour and give a 
final baste with butter. Dish when threads have 
been cut and drawn out. Thicken and season the 
gravy. Serve in gravy-boat.

is to be eaten cold, put in the water in which it is 
boiled whole cloves and long sticks of cinnamon.

Boast Venison or Mutton.— Take a leg of 
well-kept venison, wipe thoroughly, rub a little 
salt over it, cU-edge with flour. Place it in drip- 
ping-pan with ragged piece you have cut off, and 
a lictle water or wine. Put small bits of butter 
here and there over meat, set in oven and baste 
frequently until done If leg is not very fat, it is 
a good plan to lard with strips of bacon or pork.

be split open, broiled over a clear Are, aiid served 
with a piece of butter placed on each half. 

To Prepare Tripe for the table you should 
order it the day before you wish to serve it, scrape 
it thoroughly, wash it in several waters, then boil 
ill salt and water until it is perfectly tender ; let it 
drain in a platter all night. Next day cut it in 
small pieces and fry in hot lard after having rolled 
the pieces in flour. To sei-ve with this make a 
rich, brown gravy, using a little of the lard in 
which the tripe was fried. If for breakfast, send 
baked potatoes, fried apples, and tomatoes with 
it ; the tomatoes may be canned ones, cooked, 
and with thin slices of toasted bread put in the 
bottom of the dish.

Poultry. 



WmO ROAST A FOWL.- Time, 1 hour. 1 
g^lfflg large fowl, 2 or 3 large spoonfuls bread 
^S^ crumbs, pepper and salt, ^ lb. butter. Pre- 
pare fowl for roasting ; put into inside bread 
crumbs, seasoned with pepper, salt and piece of 
butter size of large walnut. Roast at a clear fire, 
Ijasting well with butter ; just before done, dredge 
with flour, and baste again with butter. When 
done, add little warm water to butter in dripping- 
pan, or a little re/// thin- melted butter, and strain 
over fowl. Serve wAXXx bread sauce, or httle gi'avy 
iu tureen if preferred. 

Roast Chicken.— Singe and truss carefully. 
Broilers, as tliey are called, are better without 
stuffing, unless \ery lai'ge. Season with salt, put 
small bits of butter over meat and ijlace in pan 
with a little water ; baste occasionally and dredge 
with flour before taking from oveu. A spring 
eliickeu ecjoked in any style is not to be despised. 
But a well-known epicure once said : 

" To roast spring chicken is to spoil it. 
.Just split it down the back and broil it." 

Goose.— This requires keeping, ths same as 
fowls, some days before cooking. The goose is 
best in the autunm and early part of winter — 
never good in spring. What is called a green 
goose is four months old. It is insipid after that, 
though tender. Pick well and singe the goose, 
then clean carefully. Put the liver and gizzard on 
to cook as a turkey's. When the goose is washed, 
and ready for stuffing, have boiled thi-ee white po- 
tatoes, skin and mash them ; chop three onions 
very fine, throw them iuto cold water ; stir into 
the potatoes a spoonful of butter, a little salt and 
black pepper, a tablespoonful of finely-rubbed 
sage leaves ; drain off the onions and mix \\ it li the 
potato, sage, etc. When well mixed, stuff the 
goose with the mixture. Have ready a c<Kirse 
needle and thi-ead, and sew up the sht made for 
cleaning and introducing the stuffing. A full- 
grown goose requires !•% hom's. Roast it as a 
turkey, dredging and basting. The gravy is pre- 
pared as for poultry, with the liver and gizzard. 
Apple-sauce is indispensable for roast goose. 

Roast Goose or Duck. —Singe, draw, and 
truss fowl ; if an old one i)arl)oil it ; best stuffing 
for a goose is sage and onions. If a strong flavor 
of onions is liked, they should be chopped raw. If 
this is not the case, should be boiled in 1 or 2 
waters, and mixed with bread crimibs powdered 
sage, salt, pepper, and Royal Extract Natmey to 
taste. Fill bird with stuffing, sew up with coarse 
thread. spriid<le salt over, and set in pan with a 
little warm watt*r. Baste frequently, and do not 
lake from t>veu uutil thoroughly cooked. 

Apple Sauce. Pare, core, and slice tart ap- 
ples, stew in watrr enough to cover tliem imtil 
they break to pirces. Beat to a pidp with a good 
lump of battel- and iileut.\ of sugai' ; serve cold. 

To Bake a Turkey.— Lft tlu- turkey be 
picked, singed and washed, aud « i|:ied dry, inside 
and out; joint only (o tlu- lirst j<iiiit in t tie legs, 
and cut some of the nnk off if it is all Ijloody : 
thencutl dozen small gashes in the rieslis partsof 
the turkey — on the outside and in diftVieut parts 
— and press 1 whole oyster iu each gash, then 
close the skin and flesh over each gash as tight'y 
as possible ; then si utt' your turkey, leaving a lit- 
tle room for the stuffiug to swell. When stuffed, 
sew it up with a stout cord, rub over lightly with 
flour, sprinkle a httle salt and pepper on it, and 
put some in your dripping-i)au ; put in your tur- 
key, baste it ofteu with its own drippings ; bake to 
a nice brown ; thicken your gravy with a little 
flour and water. Be sure and keep the bottom of 
tlie dripping-pan covered with water or it will 
lnun the gravy and make it bitter. 

Stewed Cranberries. -Wash and look over 
caiefully. Place in saucepan, little more than 
<;overed with water. Cover saui'epan and stew 



until skins are tender, adding more water if neces- 
sary ; add 1 pound sugar to each pound of berries. 
Let them simmer 10 or 12 minutes, then set away 
in a bowl or wide-mouthed crock. 

To Truss and Roast a Partridge or Pheas- 
ant.— Time, 25 to 30 minutes. Partridges should 
hang a few days. Pluck, draw and wipe part- 
ridge : cut off head, leaving sufficient skin on neck 
to skewer back ; bring legs close to breast, be- 
tween it and side bones, pass skewer through pin- 
ions and thick part of thighs. Roast anil serve 
with a httle gravy poured over birds, and bread- 
sauce and gravy in tureens. 

Fried Spring- Chicken.— Clean and joint, 
then soak in salt-water for 3 hours, irut in frying- 
pan equal parts of lard and butter —in all enough 
to cover chicken. Roll each piece in flour, or dip 
in beaten egg, then roll in cracker crumbs, and 
drop into the boiling fat. Fry until bro^vned on 
both sides. Serve on flat platter garnished with 
sprigs of parsley. Pour most of fat from frying- 
pan, thicken the remainder with browned flour, 
add to it cup of boiling water or milk. Sei-ve in 
gravy-boat. 

Fricasseed Chickens.— Clean, wash and joint 
the fowls, lay in lold salt and water for an hour. 
Putm pot with lo 11). salt pork, cut in strips, and 
cold water enough to cover them. Cover close and 
heat slowly to a gentle boil ; when fowls are full 
size and fairly tender, stew 1 hour or more after 
they begin to boil. WTien done add half -chopped 
onions, parsley and pepper, cover again for ten 
minutes. Stir up two tablespoonf uls flour in cold 
water, then into a cup of hot milk, and this in turn 
into 2 beaten eggs, then put in 1 large spoonful 
butter, and pour all iuto the saucepan ; mix well, 
boil fairly, place chickens on your dish and pour 
the gravy over them and sen^e. 

Chicken Pates.— Chop meat of cold chicken 
fine and .season well. Make large cupful rich drawn 
butter, and while on fire stir in 2 eggs, boiled hard, 
minced very flue, also a little chopped parsley, 
then chicken meat. Let almost boil. Have ready 
some pate-pans of good paste, baked quickly to 
light brown. Slip from pans while hot, fill with 
mixture and set in oveu to heat. Arrange upon 
dish and serve hot. 

Chicken Pie. — Take 2 full-grown chickens, or 
more if small, disjoint them, cut backbone, etc., 
small as convenient. Boil them with few slices of 
salt pork in water enough to cover them, let boil 
quite tender, then take out breast bone. After 
they boil, and scum is taken off, put in a little 
onion cut very fine — not enough to taste distinctly, 
just enough to flavor a little ; rub some parsley 
very fine when dry, or cut fine when green — this 
gives pleasant flavor. Season well with pepper 
and salt, and few ounces good fresh butter. When 
all is cooked well, have liquid enough to cover 
chicken, then beat 2 eggs and stir in some sweet 
cream. Line .5-quart pan with crust made like 
Soda biscuit, only more shortening, put in chicken 
and liquid, cover with crust same as lining. Bake 
till crust is done, and you will have a good chicken 
pie. 

Chicken Pie, a la Reine.— Pas/e No. 3 ; 1 
plump, tendei- cliickeu, ]4 pound salt perk, J^ tea- 
spoonful each Royal celery, salt and thyme, 4 
sprigs parsley, white pepper and salt to taste. Cut 
chicken up in small joints, the pork in neat scal- 
lops, stew gently in 114 pints water, until nearly 
cooked. Line edge of pudding dish with the paste, 
make layers of chicken, pork and seasonings, when 
used, sprinkle over the chopped parsley ; fill with 
the gravy, cover, ornament, and wash over with 
milk ; bake in steady oven 40 minutes. 

Boned Chicken. — Boil a chicken in little 
water as possible until meat will fall from hones ; 
remove all skin, chop together light and dark 
parts ; season with pepper and salt. Boil down 
liquid in which chicken was boiled, then pour it on 
meat ; place iti tin, wrap tightly in cloth, press 
with heavy weight several hours. When served,

How to Serve Melons. -Keep both water and 
musk melons on ice. Serve by wiping clean the 
water melon and laying whole upon dish, to be

chopjH li iiiiMiiall, seasoned with pepper and salt, 
and fried lightly in butter, turning them several 
times, that they may be nicely browned. 

Potato Croquettes.— Season cold mashed po- 
tatoes with pepper, salt and nutmeg. Beat to 
cream, with tablespoonful of melted butter to

Here are Three Ways to Prepare Pota- 
toes for Breakfast.— I'lrst, boil some small po- 
tatoes iu their jackets. The moment they are done 
take them out of the water. Do not allow them to be- 
come soft, as they will not keep their shape. Re- 
move the skins; have some lard, very hot, as for 
fried cakes ; drop the potatoes in and fry till 
brown, tm-uing them genily from side to side. 
The next way is to heap mashed potatoes on a 
small mound or oval platter; shape it like a pyra- 
mid and perfectly smooth ; then cover with a well- 
beaten egg, and set it in the oven to brown. Still 
another way is to make lit tie cakes of cold mashed 
potatoes ; flour your hands well, and put on as 
much flour as wfll stick on the outside of the 
cakes ; scatter flour on the plate on which you lay 
them ; fry them brown in butter. 

Stewed Mushrooms.— Let them lie in salt 
and water 1 hour, then cover with fresh water and 
stew until tender; season with butter, salt and 
pepper; cream, if you wish. 

Fried Tomatoes.— Dip thin slices of ripe to- 
matoes into flour; salt and pepper them and fry in 
boiling battel' or lard until browned. 

Fried Tomatoes. — Cut tomatoes in slices 
without skiiiuiug; pepper and salt them; then 
sprinkle a little flour over them aud fry in butter 
until brown. Put them on a hot platter and pour 
milk or cream into the butter and juice. When 
boiUng hot pour over tomatoes. 

Stuffed Tomatoes. — Get them as large and 
firm as possible ; cut a round place in ton of each, 
scrape out all the soft parts; mix with stale bread 
crumbs, corn, onions, parsley, butter, pepper and 
salt ; chop very fine, and fill tomatoes ; carefully 
bake in moderate hot oven ; put a little butter in 
pan ; see that they do not burn or become dry. 

Stewed Squash. —Pare, seed, quarter, and 
cook a selected squash soft in boiling salted water. 
Pour this off ; beat squash 10 pieces in saucepan ; 
season well and stir until stiff and smooth as apple 
sauce, and it is ready to serve. 

Cold Slaw. — 1 quart of finely shaved cabbage, 
yelks of 3 eggs w,.ll bea' en, I14 glassfuls of weak 
Vinegar, 2 teaspoonfuls white sugar, 1 tablespoon- 
ful of olive oil, }^ teacup of thick sweet cream, 
piece of butter large as a hen's egg, heaping tea- 
spoonful of salt, pepper and mustard. Mix all 
well together, put over fire till hot, then add cab- 
bage, stew until the whole is heated, place in china 
dish and set aside to become cold ; add celeiy or 
Royal celery salt before serving.

into 2 pieces. Shave 1 piece as fine as possible, 
and put it into a stewpan with a piece of butter 
the size of an egg, 1 small teaspoonful salt, and 
nearly as much pepper. Add J4 teacupful water 
and 1 teacupful of vinegar. Cover the stewpan

How to make Sauerkraut. — Barrels having 
held wine or vinegar are used to pi-epare the 
sauerkraut in. It is better, however, to have a 
special barrel for the piu-pose. Strasburg, as well 
as all Alsace, has a well-acquired fame for pre- 
paring the cabbages. They slice very \\liite and 
firm cabbages in fine shreds with a luarljiin' made 
for the purpose. At the bottom of a sinall l.an-fl 
they place a layer of coarse salt, and alternat-rly 
layers of cabbage and salt, being careful to have 
one of salt on the top. As each layer of cabbage 
is added, it must be pressed down by a large and 
heavy pestle, and fresh layers are added as soon 
as the juice floats on the surface. The cabbage 
must be seasoned with a few grains of coriander, 
juniper berries, etc. When the barrel is full it 
must be put in a dry cellar, covered with a cloth, 
under a plank, and on this heavy weights are 
placed. At the end of a few days it will begin to 
ferment, during which time the pickle must be 
drawn off and replaced by fresh, until the liquor 
becomes clear. This should be done every day. 
Renew the cloth and wash the cover, put the 
weights back and let stand for a month. By that 
time the sauerkraut will be ready for use. Care 
must be taken to let the least air possible enter the 
sauerkraut, and to have the cover perfectly clean. 
Each time the baiTel has to be opened it must be 
properly closed again. These precautions must 
not be neglected. 

Celery Minced with Egg Dressing.— 
Scrape and wash the celery and cut into J^ mch 
lengths, having first crisped it in cold water. Rub 
the yelKS of 3 eg^s (boiled hard) to a paste, with 1 
tablespoonfid ot salad oil ; add salt, pepper, a 
little powdered sugar, vinegar to make the mix- 
ture liquid, and pour over the celery, serve iu a

toughen in the vinegar.

uniform in consistency. Bottle and keep in warm 
place 24 hoiu-s; it may take.3(j in whiter. The bot- 
tles must be tightly ccjrked and the corks tied 
down. Shake well .5 minutes before opening. It 
makes a very agreeable drink, which is especially 
recommended for persons who do not assimilate 
their food, and for young children may be drank 
as freely as milk. Instead of buttermilk, some use 
a teaspoonful of yeast. It is the standard bever- 
age of the Tartars, who almost live upon it in 
summer, and is also used largely by the Russians. 
The richer your milk, which should be unskimmed, 
the better will be your koumiss.

THE ROYAL BAKER AND PASTRY COOK. 



French Coffee, No, 2. — IV^ cups ground 
coffee, rut in a flannel bag, tie top and put in old 
fashioned coffee-pot ; pour on 3 pints water, boil 
10 minutes ; serve in another coffee-pot. A very 
rich coffee can be made by adding to grounds first 
placed in bowl 1 egg, shell and all broken, and 
thoroughly mixed with coffee. Where egg is used 
omit soaking coffee groimds in water. 

Vienna Coffee. — Equal parts Mocha and Java 
coffee ; allow 1 heaping tablespoonful of coffee to 
each person, and 3 extra to make good strength. 
Mix 1 egg with grounds, pour on coffee J^ as much 
boiling water as will be needed, let coffee froth, 
then stir down grounds and let boil 5 minutes ; 
then let coffee stand where it will keep hot, but 
not boil, for 5 or 10 minutes, and add rest of water. 
To one pint of cream add white of an egg, well 
beaten ; this is to be put in cups with sugar, and 
hot coffee added. 

Maple Beer. — To 4 gallons boiling water put 
1 quart maple syrup, and 1 tablespoonful essence 
of spruce ; when about milk-warm add 1 pint 
yeast ; when fermented, bottle it. In 3 days it 
will be fit for use. 

Tea. — To make good tea is almost as difficult 
as to make good coffee ; the failure in both cases 
usually comes from not using good and sufficient 
material. Following receipt makes good tea: 
Scald teapot, put in plenty tea, cover with boiling 
water, spread thick napkin over and about it and 
let stand 5 minutes before filling with more boil- 
ing water ; let stand 10 or 12 minutes longer, and 
pour out. 

Iced Tea. — Mixed tea makes a better cold 
drink than either black or green. Strain it into 
perfectly clean bottle and keep on ice. When a 
drink is wanted, pour glass M full, sweeten 
lavishly and fill up glass with broken ice. Drink 
without cream. 



Cookery for the Sick. 



"YyOOD FOE, THE SICK. - Always prepare 
JM; toed fLir the sick in the neatest and most 
1?*^. Is caret id manner. In sickness the senses are 
unusually acute, and far more susceptible to care- 
lessness, negligences and mistakes in the pi-epara- 
tion and serving of food than when in health. 
Special wants of the body show themselves in 
special cravings for certain articles of ' food. 
These should be gratified when possible. 



Formula for making Beef Tea approved by the 
Board of Physicians of the Brooklyn, N. Y., Diet 
Dispensary. 

Beef Tea. — To every pound of beef, cut fine 
(not chopped), add 1 pint cold water, and let stand 
2 hours ; then place over a slow fire, or place on 
the extreme back part of a range, where it may 
heat through very gradually; then pull forward 
where it may come quickly to a simmer, or just 
below the boiling point. Stir thoroughly at inter- 
vals of about 10 minutes. In 2 hours from time it 
is placed over the fire it may be considered done, 
although no harm will be done if it remain ]4 hour 
longer, provided it does not boil; strain through 
a colander into an eai'then bowl. Strain the 
second time through a fine tin strainer. If it has 
been properly cooked and not allowed to boil or 
get hot too quickly, there will remain but little 
sediment from the last straining. If, on the other 
hand, these rules have not been observed, the body 
and substance of the meat will remain in the 
strainer, leaving a thin watery mixture of little 
value. Practice and watchfid care only will en- 
able the cook to bring the beef tea up to the boil- 
ing point without letting it boil. This is the test 
of the article. Do not salt while cooking, as that 
causes it to separate. 

Bouillon Soup. — See under heading Soups 
and Broths. 



Calf's Feet Jelly.— Boil 2 calf's feet, well 
cleaned, in 1 gallon water until reduced to 1 quart, 
then pour out into a pan. When cold skim off all 
the fat and take up the jelly, leaving what settling 
may remain at the bottom. Put the jelly into a 
saucepan. Pour over it 1 pint good Sherry or 
Madeira wine, J^ pound white sugar, and the juice 
of four lemons. Add to these whites of (5 or 8 eggs 
well beaten together. Stir all together thoroughly, 
place on fh-e and let boil a few minutes. Pour 
into a large flamiel bag, and repeat this until it 
runs clear ; then have ready a large china basin, 
and drop in it some lemon peel cut as thin as pos- 
sible. Let the jelly run into the basin ; the lemon 
peel will not only give it a pleasing color but a 
grateful flavor. Fill your glasses, and it will be 
ready to use. 

Chicken Broth. — See under heading of Sovps 
and Broths. 

Egg on Toast. — Brown a slice of bread nicely 
over the coals, and while doing this break an egg 
into boiling water, and let it stand over the fire tin 
the white hai-dens. Butter the toast, take up the 
egg with a skimmer, lay it on the toast and serve. 

Flaxseed. Tea. — Upon an ounce of unbruised 
flaxseed and a little pulverized litjuorice root pour 
a pint of boiling (soft or rain) \\ati r, and place the 
vessel containing these ingrcdu nts lu'ar, but not 
on, the fire for 4 hours. Stiaiu tiucngh a linen 
cloth. Make it fresh every day. An excellent 
drink in fever accompanied by a cough. 

Infants' Food. — Let 1 quart of milk stand 
over night ; skim off the cream, and upon it pour 

1 pint of boiling water. In 1 quart of water let 1 
tablespoonfid of oatmeal boil about 2 hours and 
then strain. To 1 gill of the cream and water add 

2 tablespoonfuls of the oatmeal water. Sweeten 
it when given. This receipt comes from an ex- 
perienced nurse, and has been well tested. 

Mint Tea. — In an earthen vessel put a hand- 
ful of the young shoots of mint, pour over them 
boiling water, cover closely and let it set near the 
fire for an hour. Other herb teas are made in the 
same way. Mint tea is useful in allaying nausea 
and vomiting. 

Mutton Broth. —3 pounds of lean mutton, 2 
turnips, 1 carrot, 2 onions, 1 bunch parsley, 1 cup 
mUk, 1 tablespoonful corn starch, 3 quarts water. 
Boil meat, cut into strips, and the vegetables, 
sliced, in the water 2^4 hours. The water shouM 
be reduced }^. Strain, taking out the meat, and 
rubbing the vegetables to a pulp through the col- 
ander. Cool, skim, season, and return to the fire. 
Heat, stu' in the corn starch, wet up with water, 
and pour into the tureen. Add the milk boiling 
hot. Stir well, and serve. 



Scotch Broth. - 

and Brotlis. 



-See under heading of Soups 



Stewed Prunes. — Buy box prunes, as they 
are of better quality than the open sort. Soak for 
an hour in cold water, put in a porcelain lined 
saucepan and add a little sugar. Let them stew 
an hour or more slowly, or vmtil they are soft. 
These are very good in smallpox, measles, scarlet 
fever, and the like, not only as food, but as medi- 
cine also. 

To make Gruel. —Time, 10 minutes. 1 table- 
spoonful patent groats, 2 tablespoonfuls cold 
water, 1 pmt boiling water. Mix groats with cold 
water till smooth ; then pom* boiling water on 
them, stirring all the time. Then set over fire in 
clean saucepan, and boil for 10 minutes. Sweeten 
to taste and serve. 

"Wine Posset. — In a pint of milk boil 2 or 3 
slices of bread. When soft remove it from the fii-e, 
add a little grated nutmeg and a teaspoonful of 
sugar ; then pour into it slowly i^ pint of sweet 
wine and serve it with toasted bread. 

Wine "Whey. — 1 pint sweet milk, boil and

f (JY should not be stirred while boiling. Cream 
\rr\i tartar should not be added until syrup be- 
gins to boil. Butter should be put in when candy 
is almost done. Flavors are more 4eUcate when 
not boiled in candy, but added af tenvard. 

Butter Scotch. — 3 cups sugar, 2 tablespoon- 
f uls water, piece butter size of an egg. Boil with- 
out stirring until it hardens on a spoon. Pour out 
on buttered plates to cool. 

Cream Candy.— 1 pound white sugar, 3 table- 
spoonfuls vinegar, 1 teaspoonful Royal Extract 
Lemon, 1 teaspoonful cream tartar. Add little 
water to moisten sugai-, boil imtil brittle. Put 
in extract, then tm'n quickly out on buttered 
plates. ^Vllen cool, pull imtU white, and cut in 
squares. 

Cream Walnuts. —2 cups sugar, two-thirds 
cup water. BoU without stuTing untU it will spin 
a thread; flavor with Royal Extract Fam7to. Set 
off into dish with little cold water in ; stir brisklj- 
until white and creamy. Have walnuts shelled ; 
make cream into small round cakes with your fin- 
gers; press half a walnut on either side, and drop 
into sifted granulated sugar. For cream dates, 
take fresh dates, remove stones, and fill center of 
dates with this same cream. Drop into sugar. 

Candied Horehound. — Boil horehound in 
water until juice is all extracted. Take your sugar 
and boil up to a feather; then add the horehound 
juice to the syrup ; boil up till again the same 
height; stir with a spoon against the sides of the 
sugar-pan. When it begins to grow thick, pour 
out in a paper case dusted with fine sugar and cut 
in squares. The horehound may be dried and 
then put in the sugar finely powdered and sifted. 

Candied Popcorn. — Put into an u-on kettle 1 
tablespoonful butter, 3 tablespoonfuls water, 1 
teacupful white pulverized sugar. Boil until 
ready to candy, then throw in 3 quarts of nicely 
popped corn. Stir briskly till candy is evenly dis- 
tributed over corn. Take kettle from fire, stir 
until it is cooled a little and you have each grain 
separate and crystallized with sugar, taking care 
that corn does not burn. Nuts of any kind pre- 
pared in same way. 

Cocoanut Cream Candy. —1 cocoanut, ]U 
poimds granulated sugar. Put sugar and milk of 
cocoanut together, heat slowly until sugar is 
melted; then boil 5 minutes; add cocoanut ( finely 
grated ), boil 10 minutes longer, stir constantly to 
keep from burning. Pour on buttered plates, cut 
in squares. AYill take about two days to harden. 
Use prepared cocoanut when other cannot be had.

directions for cream candy. 



Marmalades. 



ORANGE MARMALADE.- Select best 
, Florida or Seville oranges. Cut them in 
' two, take out all the pulp and juice into a 
basin, pick out the sldns and seed. Boil the rinds 
in hard water till tender, change 1 he water 2 or H 
times while boiling. Then pound in a Wedgewood 
mortar, add to it the juice aud pulp, then put all 
in preserving pan with double its w eight of loaf 
sugar, and set over a slow fire. Boil ^ hour or 
more, put into pots, cover tight with brandy 
paper. 

Transparent Marmalade. — Cut very pale 
Seville or Florida oranges into quarters : take out 
pulp, put in basin and pick out seeds and take oft 
the peel. Put the peels in a little salt water aud 
let stand over night ; then boil them iu a good 
quantity till tender. Cut into veiy thin slices and 
put them into the pulp. To each pound marma- 
lade put 11^ lbs. white powdered sugar, and boil 
for 20 minutes. If not clear and transparent in 
that time boil for few minutes longer. Keep stir- 
ring gently all the time, taking care not to bi-eak 
the slices. When cold put into jelly or sweetmeat 
glasses, tie down tightly with brandy paper, and 
over that a wet bladder. 



THE ROYAL BAKING POWDER IS ABSOLUTELY PURE. 



42 THE ROYAL BAKER AND PASTRY COOK. 



"ROYAL" 

The Only Chemically Pure Baking or Yeast Powder Known. 



The tests made by tbe Government chemists have shown that the Royal is the only- 
baking powder made that contains neither alum, or lime, and is absolutely pure. Many 
of the powders prominently advertised as pure and wholesome contain alum, lime, 
phosphates, etc., and are unsafe for use in human food. These substances are used to 
make a cheap article, without any regard to the deleterious effect they may have upon 
the health of the consumer. 

The superior quality of the Royal Baking Powder arises from the fact that only 
articles of the most wholesome character are employed in its manufacture, and that 
these articles are used only when chemically pure. The process of refining cream of 
tartar, by which all traces of lime are removed from it, is patented and controlled by 
the Royal Baking Powder Company. All the cream of tartar employed in other bak- 
ing powders is refined in the old fashioned way, by which from five to ten per cent, of 
lime is inevitably left in it. Lime is therefore unavoidably one of their constituents. 

Because of the supposed impossibility of removing the lime from cream of tartar 
when refined under the old processes, the Pharmacopoeias have classed as "pure" 
cream of tartar that was not more than six per cent, impure. It is by the use of this 
definition (which is not now correct) that some chemists certify as pure those baking 
powders that actually contain this substance to a large extent. 



REPORTS OF GOVERNMENT CHEMISTS. 

It is a scientific fact that Royal Baking Powder is absolutely pure. I will go still 
further and state that, because of the facilities that company have for obtaining per- 
fectly pure cream of tartar, and for other reasons dependent upon the constituents used 
in its manufacture, the proper proportions of the same, and tlie method of its prepara- 
tion, the Royal Baking Powder is undoubtedly the purest and most reliable baking 
powder offered to the public. 

HENRY A. MOTT, M. D., Ph. D. 

Late U. S. Government Chemist. 



I have examined the cream of tartar manufactured for and used by the Royal Bak- 
ing Powder Company in the manufacture of their baking powder, and find it to be 
perfectly pure, and free from lime in any form. All chemical tests to which I have 
submitted it have proved the Royal Baking Powder perfectly healthful, of uniform, 
excellent quality, and free from any deleterious substance. 

WM. McMURTRIE, E. M., Ph. I). 
Chemist in Chief U. S. Dept. of AgriculUire, 
Washington, I). C. 

I have tested a package of Royal Baking Powder, which I purchased in the open 
market, and find it composed of pure and wholesome ingredients. It is a cream of 
tartar powder of a high degree of merit, and does not contain either alum or phos- 
nhates, or other iniurious substances.

BAKING POWDER TRICKS. 

Many spurious baking powders are introduced by disreputable tricks. Peddlers 
travel from house to house, and try to prove by tests that their baking powder is as 
good as the Royal. The samples of their own goods carried for testing are specially 
prepared, by the addition of the white of an egg, gum, flour, or some other substance, 
to show some peculiar action, or by chemicals to destroy the odor of their gases when 
given off in testing. All first-class baking powders, when heated or mixed with water, 
will give off gases that are perceptible to the sense of smell. 

These pretended tests are dishonest tricks. Their object is to destroy the baking 
powder found in the kitchen, to weaken the faith of the housekeeper in it, and to intro- 
duce an impure and often dangerous article in its place. 

All who attempt to tamper with our food should be turned from the door, and their 
samples thrown away. 

The Royal Baking Powder has been in use for a quarter of a century. Its absolute 
purity and wholesomeness are guaranteed by the impartial tests of the Government 
chemists, as well as by all Boards of Health. Careful housekeepers who desire pure 
and perfect food, and who have'a regard for the health of their families, will use no 
other. 



DANGER FROM ALUM AND PRIZE BAKING POWDERS. 

The public is cautioned against buying baking powders by weight or bulk. All 
such powders are made from alum. 

All baking powders sold with a prize or gift are to be avoided, as they are from 30 
to 60 per cent. alum. 

Alum baking powders are classed as poisonous by the most eminent physicians and 
chemists. They cost but three cents a pound to make, and, being sold at from 30 to 
40 cents, are also a commercial fraud. They cause indigestion, heartburn, headache, 
dyspepsia, and diseases of the liver and kidneys. Tbey may be known by the lower 
price at which they are sold, or by the prize that accompanies them, and by the bitter 
taste they impart to the bread or biscuit. 



ROYAL IN ALL WAYS SUPERIOR. 

I have made analyses of a number of samples of the Royal Baking Powder, pur- 
chased by myself from the dealers in Washington. I find it to be absolutely pure, 
containing no lime, no alum, or any injurious article whatever. The ingredients are 
only those proper for a baking powder of the highest degree of excellence as to whole- 
someness and strength. Its entire freedom from lime and alumina, which are found in 
all baking powders made from commercial cream of tartar, from phosphates, or with 
alum, is an evidence of the remarkable perfection to which this most admirable baking 
preparation has been brought in respect to the purity of its ingredients, and renders it 
much superior to any other I have examined, or whose composition has been made 
known.

DO IN^OT USE 

Cream Tartar and Soda. 



When tliese articles are adulterated, or servants are not particular to 
use the jjroper proportions of each, they will produce unwholesome cake 
and biscuit, with a disagreeable alkaline taste, full of yellow specks or 
reddish-yellow streaks. Prof. CliandUr, President of the Board of 
Health of the City of Neio-York, states in his report, that upon investi- 
o-ation he found nearly all the Cream of Tartar sold by grocers was 
adulterated from 80 to 90 per cent, with white clay (Terra Alba), Alum, 
or other hurtful substances. These ingredients are very dangerous to 
liealth ; they impoverish the blood, produce Dyspepsia, serious Kidney 
complaints, and destroy the enamel of the teeth. Many housekeepers 
are of the impression that Baking Powder is a chemical compound dan- 
gerous to use ; this is true of the cheap kincfe, which are mixed with the 
same ingredients used to adulterate Cream of Tartar. 

Prof. Chandler, in his report to the Board of Health, strongly recom- 
mends the use of a well-known baking powder (like the Royal) in all 
kinds of baking, as being more convenient, economical, and much better 
tlian the old-fashioned methods. It is absolutely pure ; made from pure 
drape Cream Tartar, and free from injurious substances of every kind. 
It is manufactured with the greatest of care, and in such exact propor- 
tions that it is impossible for a servant to fail with it. 

The housekeei^er should bear in mind that an absolutely pure powder 
like the Royal cannot be bought at the same price as the adulterated 
kinds. While the price of this powder is so low as to bring it within the 
reach of all, yet thei'e are storekeepers who urge cheaper kinds, because 
the pi-ofits to them are larger. The genuine Royal is sold only in securely 
labeled tin cans. Baking Powdei' loose or in paper packages loses its 
strength and wastes. Refuse to buy it in that "shape. 



I^BnyCEls/tBEH^ THIS- 

In all your old receipts where creaiii tartar aud soda f)r saleratus are 
failed for, you can substitute Royal Baking I'owdoi- and get better 
results. The usual proportions in tlie old way are : 

2 teaspoon fuls Cream Tartar, 
1 teaspoonful Soda or Saleratus; 

Instead of which 
USE 2 TEASPOONFULS OF ROYAL BAKING POWDER. 

and mix it with the flour while dry. This powder is so pure and 
perfectly combined, that one-third less of it will do better work than 
cream tartar and soda.

REPORTS OF GOVERNMENT CHEMISTS 
As to Purity and Wholesomeness of the Boyal Baking Powder. 

" I have tested a package of Royal Baking Powder, which I purchased in the 
open market, and find it composed of pure and wholesome ingredients. It is a cream 
of tartar powder of a high degree of merit, and does not contain eithei' alum or 
phosphates, or other injurious substances. E. G. Love, Ph.D. 

■ " It is a scientific fact that the Royal Baking Powder is absolutely pure. The 
Royal Baking Powder is undoubtedly the purest and most reliable baking powder 
offered to the public. H. A. Mott, Ph. D. 

" The Royal Baking Powder is purest in quality and highest in strength of any 
baking powder of which I have knowledge. Wm. McMuktrie, Ph.D. 

The Royal Baking Powder received the highest award over all competitors at 
the Vienna World's Exposition, 1873 ; at the Centennial, Philadelphia, 1876 ; at the 
American Institute, New York, and at State Fairs throughout the country. 

No other article of human food has ever received such high, emphatic, and uni- 
versal endorsement from eminent chemists, physicians, scientists and Boards of 
Health all over the world. 

Note.— The above Diagkam illustrates the comparative worth of various Baking 
Powders, as shown by Chemical Analysis and experiments made by Prof. Schedler. 
A pound can of each powder was taken, the total leavening power or volume in 
each can calculated, the result being as indicated. This practical test for worth by 
Prof. Schedler only proves what every observant consumer of the Royal Baking 
Powder knows by practical experience, that, while it costs a few cents per pound 
more than ordinary kinds, it is far more economical, besides affording the advant- 
age of better work. A single trial of the Royal Baking Powder wiU convince any 
fair minded person of these facts. 

* While the diagram shows some of the alum powders to be of a comparatively 
high decree of strenffth, it is not to be taken as indicating that they have any value. 
All alum powders, no matter how high their strength, are to be avoided as dangerous.
