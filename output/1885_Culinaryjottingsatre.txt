PREFACE TO THE FIFTH EDITION, 



f^HE Jottings have again undergone very careful revision. By 
^ pruning unnecessary matter, and simplifying the recipes 
wherever possible, space has been found for considerable addi- 
tions without adding materially to the bulk or cost of the book. 

It is hoped that the endeavours thus made to effect improve- 
ment may prove successful, and that the public by whom the 
four earlier editions have been so kindly received will have 
reason to be satisfied with 

Wyvern.

AUTHOR'S PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION- 



^HEN I first began to write about Cookery I flattered 
-o* myself that I had undertaken a very easy, and plea- 
sant task. I thought that my jottings would be composed 
ciirrente calamo, and that I should be able to carry out my 
proje(fl with satisfa6lion and success. But at the hour of 
launching my frail shallop from the shore, I am compassed about 
with grave doubts concerning its seaworthiness. Alas ! : — 

" My conscience hath a thousand several tongues. 

And every tongue bi-ings in a several tale, 

And every tale condemns me for" 

a very Icarus. 
Lo ! the wings of my ambition have melted, and I have fallen 
into the sea of blighted hope. I am only conscious of failure. 
I undertook much, what have I performed ? Whilst, however, 
I frankly acknowledge my many shortcomings, I derive some 
consolation in trying to believe that, there may nevertheless 
be a few things recorded in the pages of my book which v/ill 
be found useful. If this hope be realized, and if the Ladies 
OF Madras — to whom, in all humility, I dedicate the first 
fruits of vny labours — discover here and there a word of assist- 
ance when perplexed about their daily orders, I shall be bounti- 
fully rewarded, and the winter of my discontent will indeed 
be made glorious summer. 

I have to tender my best acknowledgments to the Proprietors 
of the Madras Athenceion and Daily News for the permission 
they have kindly given me to republish my culinary articles 
which appeared originally in that journal ; I have to express 
my gratitude for the hints I have received from friendly savants 
in the science of cookery ; and to own that I have obtained 
the most valuable aid from the writings of Jules Gouffe, and 

the"G. C."

NTRODUCTION. 



" The subject of Cookery is worthy of study, and one to which 
English people would do well to give their attention. If that man 
is a benefactor to his race who makes two blades of grass grow 
where only one did before, the art must be worth cultivating that 
enables a persoa to make one pound of meat go as far, by proper 
cooking, as two by neglect and inattention." — Dr. Lankester's " Good 
Food." 

'T^T'^T^HILST reform slow, yet sure, has of late years 
VTr been creeping into our style of living in India, 
the want of a hand-book on culinary science — 
locally considered — of a more modern description than that 
time-honoured and, in its day, excellent work " Indian 
Domestic Cookery^' must have been long felt by the busy 
housewife of Madras. 

Our dinners of to-day would indeed astonish our Anglo- 
Indian forefathers. With a taste for light wines, and a far 
more moderate indulgence in stimulating di'inks, has been 
germinated a desire for delicate and artistic cookery. 
Quality has superseded quantity, and the molten curries 
and florid oriental compositions of the olden time — so fear- 
fully and wonderfully made — have been gradually banished 
from our dinner tables. 

For although a well-considered curry, or mulUgatunny, — 
capital things in their way, — are still very frequently given 
at breakfast or at luncheon, they no longer occupy a posi-

tion in the dinner menu of establisliments conducted accord- 
ing to the new regime. 

A little treatise on cookery, then, showing the reader 
how to accomplish successfully, with the average means at 
his disposal in this country, some of the many tasty dishes 
spoken of in the modern English and continental books 
upon the subject, will, I am sanguine enough to hope, be 
i-eceived with kindly toleration, if not lA-ith cordiality, by 
those who consider it worth while to be interested in 
matters culinary. 

Thirsting for some instruction of this kind, I remember 
buying, some few years ago, a little book which had just 
then been published at Madi-as, and which promised by its 
title to provide the thing needful. Alas ! how sorely dis- 
appointed was I with my purchase, for the work had 
assuredly been written for the Anglo-Indian in England 
rather than for the Englishman in India. 

"With the exception of dishes of purely native origin, little 
or no instruction worth following was given to the Madras 
housewife, whilst there was much dangerous counsel prof- 
fered which should be most carefully avoided. The most 
reprehensible customs were, in point of fact, laid down over 
and over again as precepts. Concerning these, I will say 
nothing now, for I propose to devote a separate chapter to 
the important subject of the cook-room, and to expose the 
besetting sins of our native cooks whenever they occur to me. 

The book to which I refer has not, as far as I am aware, 
been followed here by any fresh work, and I think, I may 
say that at any rate its pages scarcely contained the sort 
of instruction we look for now-a-days. In taking upon 
myself, therefore, the task of humbly ministering to the 
reformed taste of the hour, I am encouraged by the reflec- 
tion that I am, so to speak, a breaker of fresh ground. 



INTRODUCTION. 



I propose to carry out mj scheme in a series of chapters 
commencing with, cook-room experiences, the judicious 
management of the cook, and some general remarks on the 
equipment of the store-room and kitchen ; then to take the 
salient features of a dinner one bj one, and when I have 
discussed soups, fish, entrees, &c., &c., to submit a number 
of menus, worked out in detail, adapted to our resources in 
this part of India. 

I know full well that to several accomplished disciples of 
Brillat Savarin at Madi^as, I can impart nothing new. On 
the contrary, it would better become me to sit at their feet 
and listen, than to rush in where they have hesitated to 
tread. To this talented coterie, I appeal for forbearance. 
I entreat them to be merciful inasmuch as they are very 
strong. I feel, indeed, that in their presence, I may truly 
say with Ramasamy, that I am " a yevj poor man, — I beg 
your pardon." 

No. I address my jottings to the many who yearn to 
follow reform, but who cannot discover the method of doing 
so ; who, — to quote the words of a very hospitable friend, — 
"like nice things better than nasty things," yet have 
hitherto failed to penetrate the secret of success ; and who 
view with daily sorrow the lamentable parody of dinner 
which it seems good to their cooks to place before them, 
I shall treat of cosy, sociable little dinners of from two 
to ten people, rather than of the elaborate banquets of the 
great ; and the main object before me will always be to 
study economy in conjunction with the system I advocate.

The Menu. 




LL who have studied the reformed system of dinner- 
giving will, I think, agree with me when I say that 
the menu of a dinner anywhere, but in India espe- 
cially, should be reduced to the smallest compass possible. 
An hour at the outside should suffice for the discussion of 
the daintiest of bills of fare, so to ensure this, we should 
strike out of it all unnecessary encumbrances. Let the 
little card be clothed in the white garb of simplicity and 
completeness, and I am prepared to declare that all our 
lady guests, and amajoHty of the men we entertain, will 
rejoice at the result. 

A cosy dinner to be perfect should be, it seems to me, a 
highly finished cabinet picture with every atom of detail 
carefully worked out, rather than a large pretentious canvas 
with an infinite amount of color expended in order to pro- 
duce a satisfactory impression. Every line of the little 
TYienu should, therefore, be written with a loving hand, and 
both lights and shadows should be considered, for our 
guests must e'en partake of each dish we offer them. 

Soup, fish, two well contrasted entrees served separately, 
one joint only, game, and a dressed vegetable, one entremets 
Sucre, an iced pudding, cheese with liors d' ceuvres and des- 
sert, will be found, if thoughtfully composed, ample fare 



THE MENU. 



for even the most hypercritical gourmet we can bid to our 
table. In the studied completeness of such a dinner as 
this will repose its chief attraction : — in good wine, no lack 
of ice, the brightest plate, snowy linen, well-toned light, 
and tasteful adornment of the table ; with all minutiae 
remembered — from des petits pains in the deftly-folded 
napkins, to the artistic salad which in all modern menus is 
not expressed yet, like salt, understood to be present. 

An extra joint may, of course, be given, but if the two 
entrees be really nice, and the game about to follow be the 
best in season, I fail to recognize the necessity of the 
addition. 

And, here, it may not be altogether unprofitable to con- 
sider attentively certain points connected with the modern 
banquet upon which opinions differ, and concerning which 
a good many people find a difficulty in coming to a satis- 
factory decision. 

The moot point or points to which I refer are associated 
with the general plan or arrangement of the menu, and in 
order to explain them, it will be necessary to trace their 
cause carefully. 

In the days of old, our forefathers divided their bills of 
fare into a number of courses. Thus, the soup and fish 
comprised the first course ; the entrees and joint the second ; 
and the game and sweets the third ; cheese and dessert 
being served independently. But of late years, we have 
simplified matters, and the modern menu, adapted to a 
great extent, of course, from that of France, is placed 
before us in two " services," as exemplified in the following 
table : — 

Potage ... Sonp. 

Premier service ... ^ ^''^'^^^^ - ^'^^• 

Entrees ... Side-dishes. 

^Eelevds ... Joint, or remove. 



CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 



Clivts ... The roast (game or poultry). 

Second service J ^'^'^^'"^fs ... Savory and sweet dishes. 

I Fromage ... Cheese. 

[JDessert ... Dessert, 
In addition to the above, the custom of presenting 
oysters before the soup is becoming daily more fashionable, 
and many people have adopted the practice of sending 
round liors d' oeiivres, in the continental manner, as a pre- 
lude to the repast. A matter of this kind is obviously a 
matter of taste, touching which no writer on cookery should 
take upon himself to lay dovra an arbitrary law. I am 
personally decidedly in favour of the oyster, or, when 
oysters cannot be got, of a single, well selected, Jiors (V 
ceuvre. The dainty atom titivates the palate, as it were, 
and prepares it for the soup that is about to come. When, 
however, a relish of this description is given, it will be 
found decidedly advantageous, be it noted, if plates con- 
taining it be put upon the table in the places laid for the 
guest before dinner is announced. The time that would be 
taken up in handing the dishes round, is in this way 
economised. 

Considerable diversity of opinion exists, I know, concern- 
ing the next point, viz., whether the entrees should precede 
the releves or follow them. Brillat Savarin's injunction 
was — " let the order of serving be from the more substan- 
tial dishes to the lighter ;" and Sir Henry Thompson 
says : — " As a rule, to which there are few exceptions, the 
procession of dishes after the fish is from the substantial 
to the more delicate, then to the contrasts between more 
piquant flavour and sweetness." 

Now, if we are to discuss this point properly, it seems 
to me that there is another very important factor in the 
debate that must not be lost sight of, viz., the rot, or roast. 
To this item of the menu Brillat Savarin gave, and Sir 
Henry Thompson gives, let us remember, its full and dis^ 



THE MENU. 



tinct value ; and it can hardly be denied that, if the rot be 
served correctly, the releve must be put further forward in 
the bill of fare. 

What, then, is the rot ? Well, from personal observation, 
I am constrained to say that this is a matter upon which 
many dinner-givers appear to be somewhat hazy. The rot 
is, correctly speaking, a service of roast poultry or game : 
it should be accompanied by a nice salad, and it is often 
garnished with potato chips and water-cress. An entremets 
de legume may either be handed round with it, or follow it 
separately. In Brillat Savarin's time the truffled turkey 
appeared as a rot, and Sir Henry Thompson recommends 
the presentation at this period of the feast of the truffled 
pheasant or capon, the dindonneau (turkey poult), the 
fatted fow^l, &c. 

It is, therefore, pretty evident that if we serve our rots 
according to this — the undoubtedly correct interpretation — 
it would be absolutely preposterous to serve immediately 
before them a goodly joint of mutton or of beef with its 
concomitant vegetables. Between two courses so nearly 
equal in substance, there would plainly be no contrast, 
and the effect would be overpowering and common-place. 

We are now at liberty to consider the releve. Strictly 
speaking, this word cannot be translated " joint." It should 
properly be interpreted the " remove," and in the French 
meniL the dish of which it is composed is regarded as the 
piece de resistance of the dinner. To begin with, it ought, 
if possible, not to be roasted. According to the authorities 
I have named, it should rather be an artistic braise, 
fricandeau, or a whole fillet, larded and served with vege- 
tables. Thus, the releve becomes very nearly as elaborate 
as a made-dish, and is scarcely what an Englishman means 
when he speaks of the " joint." 



8 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS, 

It need scarcely be said, then, that if this system be fol- 
lowed in its entii'ety, the rot and the releve being carefully 
selected, the service of two light entrees between them is 
both intelligible and artistic. 

In favour of the older English custom it has been argued, 
with considerable justice, that delicate works of culinary 
science — such as entrees are supposed to be — should be pre- 
sented while the palate is yet fresh, and while the diner is 
thoroughly able to detect and appreciate the niceties of 
flavour, crispness, tenderness, and so forth ; that a slice of 
plainly roasted or boiled meat, with a selected vegetable, 
should follow ; then a morsel of game, and the entremets. 
Advocates of this very excellent method, it will be observ- 
ed, do not pay any particular attention to the rot. When 
game is out of season, they present a savory entremets 
immediately after their releve, and send round their salad 
with the saddle or sirloin. Thus, in the space marked in 
the printed menu for " rots,'' we occasionally see " aspic de 
foie gras" w^th " asperges en branches" and no rot whatever. 

Of the two systems the older one is certainly the simpler. 
The correct introduction of the rot is really the novel feature 
of the new menu — ^^ poulet au cresson, salade,'' for example, 
never figured in the old bill of fare in the place of game — 
and by its introduction the releve, altered a good deal in 
character, is of necessity pushed out of its original place. 

It will always be conceded, I think, by partisans of both 
systems, that each possesses merits of an undeniable 
character. The old method, as we have seen, is the simpler, 
and consequently the easier of the two, while the new may 
be voted more truly artistic. In adopting the latter, how- 
ever, it is a sine qua nan that all the principles of the 
dinner be observed, and faithfully carried out. We cannot 
miss a single point, or our little feast will become & fiasco. 



THE MENU. 



We must not serve, that is to saj, ^^ pintade au cresson' as 
a releve, or '■'■ jamhon au madere' as a rot — trifling errors 
that I have noticed at certain banquets modelled according 
to the new regime. Neither can we forget the salad, which, 
with its plain dressing of oil and vinegar (not a thick eggy 
one, I beg) should accompany the rot as a matter of course. 

If unable to follow the rules of the revised menu accurate- 
ly, owing to an indifferent market, or some other unavoida- 
ble reason, the wise dinner-giver should fall back upon the 
older form, and be contented with a less pretentious festival. 
The superiority of the new order of things consists in a 
more artistic distribution of light and shadow. If we rob 
the picture of an effective ray of sunshine here, and forget 
a judicious touch of shadow there, we can hardly complain 
if our efforts result in disappointment. 

At the commencement of these remarks, I spoke of the 
economy of time in serving a dinner — a subject which, I 
am sure, every earnest follower of reform will allow, should 
command our closest attention. Of the two menus I have 
spoken of, the older form would perhaps seem to be the 
quicker served, and in establishments where the new system 
has not been long in practice, I certainly have observed that 
the dinner was a little too long. I, however, attribute this 
to the novelty of the service, which at first very naturally 
perplexes servants who have long been accustomed to a 
different method. When once understood and generally 
adopted, I do not think that the new arrangement will be 
found longer than the old. 

A good deal of time can obviously be saved if the giver 
of the feast be mindful of the importance of that desider- 
atum. The releve, for instance, should undoubtedly be 
carved at the huffet, and each portion should be sent round 
with its accompanying vegetable also helped at the side 
table. I have seen a sliced fillet of beef handed round a 



10 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

table of eighteen people, with vegetables following it, and a 
large dish containing slices of a saddle of mutton garnished 
with divers vegetables, also carried round. The waste of 
time, not to mention the positive nuisance of such a method 
of service, need scarcely be dilated upon. 

At a large party I would always hand round the entremets 
de legume with the rut, and in composing the dinner, I 
would select the entremets so as to harmonize with the roast 
game or poultry — -petits jpois au beurre with wild duck 
or teal, epinards a la creme with quails, &c., &c. 

If the essential need of brisk service be kept in view, 
people who have declared themselves in favour of the new 
form of menu, and are determined to carry it out correctly, 
ought not only to deserve but to command success ; while 
those who have already achieved a reputation with the 
older one, will do well not to bid adieu to a system which, if 
somewhat less artistic, provides, at all events, a very reliable 
and decidedly enjoyable way of entertaining their friends. 

But in either case you cannot make your dinner too 
simple in detail, and the fewer servants you employ to 
carry it out the better. How distressing it is to see a herd 
of attendants, mobbing each other like a scared flock of 
sheep, at a time when everything should be as orderly, 
and as quiet as possible. To ensure calm service, pare 
down the number of your dishes to the fewest possible, 
and for eight guests never allow more than four servants, 
besides youi^ butler, to attend the table. 

If these remarks be correct, as far as a small dinner of 
eight is concerned, how much more do they apply to large 
banquets ? In the case of official entertainments, success 
is too frequently marred by very indifferent service. The 
indirect cause of this is, as a rule, an over-crowded menu. 

With a great many guests it is, of course, necessary to 
call in a quantity of waiters who have never worked 



THE MENU, 11 



together before, and an undisciplined crowd of native 
servants will most certainly ruin the best dinner that ever 
was cooked, unless you reduced the work they have to per- 
form to the best of youi' ability. 

At such dinners as these even I would never give more 
than two really good entrees, served separately, and with- 
out any dishes of vegetables accompanying them ; then, say, a 
white vegetable with potatoes for the turkey, and French 
beans, or peas, with potatoes for the saddle. 

The menu should invariably indicate the particular vege- 
table you intend to serve with the releve, thus : — Selle de 
mouton aux haricots verts, Fricandeau au chou-fleur, Piece de 
hoeuf hraisee au celeri, Quartier d'agneau aux jpetits pois, §x. 
To save time, a portion of the vegetable named should be 
helped with the meat, potatoes alone being handed round. 
It is the essence of ignorance, and of bad taste to send a 
number of vegetables round with the joint. Almost as bad. 
in fact, as the practice of serving them with the entrees. 

At a large dinner, you sometimes see tuimips, cabbages, 
cauliflowers, French beans, and potatoes (occupying five 
waiters) going round together. For the Anglo-Saxon 
delights in quantity, and his soul loveth display exceed- 
ingly. Masses of incongimous diet may be necessary at a 
yeomanry festival, or after an Agi^icultural Show at the 
county town ; but educated people who have travelled, 
and who have had opportunities of forming refined notions 
of human nature in general, and of food in particular, 
ought surely to be better satisfied with a little, really well 
considered, than with abundance inartistic in its arrange- 
ment, and indifferently served. 




OZE^I^^IPTEPB ZI- 



The Cook and his Management. 

FTER some years of observation I have come to the 
conclusion that if you want to put nice little din- 
ners upon your table, you must not only be pre- 
pared to take an infinite amount of trouble, but you must 
make a friend of your chef. Unless amicable relations 
exist between the cook and his mistress or master, the 
work will never be carried out satisfactorily. There will 
be a thousand and one annoying failures, your mind will 
never know what repose means", and, in the end, — utterly 
wearied with the daily struggle against petty larceny, 
carelessness, ignorance, stupidity, and an apparently way- 
ward desire to thwart your desires to the utmost, — you 
will resign the baton to your butler, and submit in sheer 
desperation to that style of dinner unto which it may 
please him to call you. 

I do not allude to people happy in the possession of a 
butler absolutely capable of composing, with very little 
aid, a fairly good menu, and able to direct the cook in the 
manipulation thereof. There are, I know, a few estimable 
men of that kind to be found — in point of fact, I am ac- 
quainted with three or foui' — but alas ! they are rare to 
meet, and even the cleverest of them requires a little di- 
plomatic supervision, or he will di-ift into a gi'oove of din- 
ners, and tire you with repetitions. Are not the accounts, 



THE COOK AND HIS MANAGEMENT. 13 

also, of the erudite maitre cV hotel full often prone to cause, 
— even at the pretty writing table of the cosy boudoir, — 
great searchings of heart ? In other words, must you not 
pay for your luxury, and even murmur not in the presence 
of the artist who spares you so much trouble ? 

Those who are not gifted with patience, those who are 
not physically strong, those who have important calls 
upon their time away from home, and, of coiu'se, those 
who do not feel capable of directing culinary operations, 
cannot do better than entrust the management of their 
kitchens to alien heads ; but all who are equal to the task, 
should take the helm in their own hands, rememberino" 
that ancient canon, — " if you want a thing well done, do 
it yourself," 

I place those who have not patience first on the list of 
persons whom I deem incapable of managing their cooks. 
I do so advisedly, for of all failings inimical to the success- 
ful direction of a native servant, a hasty temper is the 
most fatal. The moment you betray irritation and hasti- 
ness in your manner towards Hamasamy, he ceases to 
follow you. His brain becomes busy in the consultation 
of his personal safety, and not in the consideration of the 
plat you may be endeavouring to discuss with him. In 
this matter I, of course, address my readers of the sterner 
sex. Ladies, I know, are never angry, and even when a 
little put out, do they not contrive to veil their feelings 
with a sweet subtlety which men can envy, yet never hope 
to acquire ? 

Once upon a time I knew very intimately the Mess Pre- 
sident of a Regiment (not yet forgotten I fancy at Ban- 
galore) who possessed to an eminent degree the qualities 
necessary for his difficult position. He was an acknow- 
ledged connoisseur in wines, excelled in the composition 
of a menu, and rejoiced in a bountiful development of the 

2 



14 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

bump of management. Long association, liowever, with 
one of tlie best Messmen a Regiment ever had in England 
had spoilt my friend for the up-hill task of managing 
Kamasamy. The consequence was that the ordering of a 
dinner with him was generally productive of nn mauvais 
quart cVheure. I remember, one special day, hearing my 
friend's voice raised to its highest pitch ; presently the 
door of the little room he occuiDied as an office flew open, 
and out rushed the cook, followed by his preceptor ^-iolet 
in the face with wrath. The unhappy menial, in a state 
of hopeless mental aberration, had taken down that he 
was to hoil the pclte de foie gras, and ice the asparagus !* 
I was called in as interpreter and peace-maker, and many 
a moraing after that did I convey my friend's orders to 
the mess cook. I was obliged, however, to demand an 
empty room, for even during my interpretations the Pre- 
sident's patience would evaporate, and the walls would 
ring with language that was fashionable when George the 
Third was King. 

There are two ways of imparting the details of a menu 
to your native cook : — one through the medium of your 
butler, the other by conversation with the man himself. 
For many reasons I advocate the latter plan. Some cooks 
do not care for the butler's interference, and in many 
establishments, the cook and butler do not pull. Butlers, 
again, are prone to conceit, and often pretend to under- 
stand what you want done, rather than confess their 
ignorance. You may perhaps remember the same failing 
in your munshi who never admitted himself to be puzzled 
by the most intricate passage in English that you could 
place before him. 

So I prefer to get the cook alone, and talk to him very 

* I do not mean to insinuate by this that iced asparagus is not 
a delicions entremets; in the case in point, however, the mistake 
made by the cook is obvious. — W. 



THE COOK AND HIS MANAGEMENT. 15 

gently in his own patois. I encourage him by a bland 
demeanour, and if obliged to speak retrospectively of a 
failure, I strive to do so with a smile. You will soon get 
i-ound Ramasamy when he finds that you never indulge in 
" very bad ' busing :" he then gains confidence in you and 
learns rapidly. Between ourselves too, surely an artist 
who can actually compose a ^^ petit pctte a la financiere,'' 
a " hramoushj mix huUres," or a " supreme de volaille,'' 
deserves some consideration at our hands. The patois is 
easily acquired, and you will soon find yourself interpret- 
ing the cherished mysteries of Francatelli or Gouffe in 
the pigeon English of Madras with marvellous fluency. 
You will even talk of " putting that troople," " mashing 
bones all," " minching," " chimmering," &c., &c., with- 
out a blush. 

There can be no doubt that in our Ramasamy we possess 
admirable materials out of which to form a good cook. 
The work comes to him, as it were, of its own accord. 
But we should take heed lest he grow up at random, cling- 
ing affectionately to the ancient barbarisms of his fore- 
fathers. "We should watch for his besetting sins, and root 
them out whenever they manifest themselves. 

We should, moreover, remember that a dish once success- 
fully presented will not necessarily appear so again unless 
the artist be reminded de novo of the secrets of its compo- 
sition. 

Mint, as a flavouring agent, save with green peas, in 
certain wine " cups," and in bond fide mint sauce, is one of 
the banes of the cook-room ; its use, and that of any parsley 
except the curled English variety, should be considered 
absolutely penal. The very smell of " country" parsley is 
assuredly sufficient to warn the unwary, and yet many 
native cooks bring it home daily. The weed has been 
called " parsley" ever since they can remember, and they 



16 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

fail to appreciate the wide difference between it, and the 
real herb. 

All native cooks dearly love the spice box, and they all 
reverence " Worcester Sauce," JX^ow, I consider the latter 
too powerful an element by far for indiscriminate use in 
the kitchen, especially so in India where our cooks are 
inclined to over-flavour everything. If in the house at all, 
the proper place for this sauce is the cruet-stand where 
it can be seized in an emergency to drown mistakes, and 
assist us in swallowing food that we might otherwise 
decline. But it should be preserved from Ramasamy with 
the same studious care as a bottle of chloroform from a 
lady suffering from acute neuralgia. 

Spice, if necessary, should be doled out in atoms, the 
cook ought never to have it under his control. 

Does every housekeeper appreciate sufficiently the 
invaluable trimmings of meat, skin, and bone, which 
remain, say, after a number of tasty choplets have been 
prepared for the grid-iron from a neck of mutton ? Do all 
know that Ramasamy 's domestic curry often gains, whilst 
we lose, the nice savouiy sauce which should have accom- 
panied our entree ; but then, if " missus din't give arder 
for using bits all," can Ramasamy, a child of this woi-ld, 
be blamed ? 

In the various receipts which I hope to give, you will 
always find a few lines reserved for the treatment of the 
scraps, and as each bad habit of the cook-room occurs to 
me, I will endeavour to expose and explain it to the best 
of my power.

Certain Kitchen Requisites. 

LL OWING- then, that our native cooks are, by na- 
ture, adapted to their calling, and that by judi- 
cious treatment we can develop the talent which 
they possess, one of the next things for consideration is 
our kitchen equipment, and the kind of utensils which 
will be found best suited for Ramasamy's use, bearing in 
mind the sort of dishes we shall hereafter call upon him 
to prepare. 

In introducing novelties of European construction to the 
Indian cook-room it is, a sine quel non to proceed with cau- 
tion. Ramasamy is intensely conservative, and a sworn 
foe to innovations. Perchance there are amongst my 
readers some who can look back with a sigh to sundry 
patented culinary nicknacks brought out from England, 
in happy anticipation of grand cook-room reforms, to 
India, which, misunderstood from the first, were either 
soon cast aside as worthless from barbarous treatment, or 
diverted to uses which would drive the inventors crazy to 
think of. I call to mind having observed an instance of 
this kind when staying once with a friend on the Hills. 
The water for my bath was brought, I noticed, in the 
outer vessel of a " Warren's patent cooking pot." " Yes," 
said my host sorrowfully when I mentioned the occurrence, 
" I could never prevail upon my fellows to use the thing in 



18 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

tlie Mtclien, so they do vrliat tliey like with it : the inner 
vessel makes a capital tom-tom for heating a sJiolah." 

Left entirely alone, with articles of his own selection 
around him, the native cook is, however, a singularly in- 
genious creatui'e. All men who have been accustomed to 
a nomad life under canvas — far from the busy hum of 
cantonments — will, I think, agree with me in this. Given 
a hold in the ground, and a' couple of stones for her range, 
with a bundle of jungle sticks, a chatty or two, ferliaps a 
degchee, and a fan, wherewithal to prepare a dinner, can 
you picture to yourself the face of Martha, the " thorough 
good cook" of an English household ? 

An amusing episode happened some few years ago which 
struck me at the time as illustrative to a degree of Rama- 
samy's opinion of the British system of cookery. I hap- 
pened to be with a Regiment at Secunderabad which, for 
reasons connected with the antiquated barracks we occu- 
pied, was ordered to move into a standing camp. Our 
Colonel, an exceedingly young and fortunate officer, was 
a rampant soldier of the new school. His brain was ever 
busy with new ideas : it was even reported that he slept 
with " Wolseley's soldier's pocket-book" and " The Rules 
for Signalling in connection with Outpost duty" under his 
pillow. The order to march into camp delighted him. 
After issuing his orders concerning the geometrical lines 
in which he wished the tents to be pitched, not even for- 
getting the whitewashing of the tents' pegs, he turned his 
attention to the kitchens. Here was an opportunity for 
practically establishing a " Wolseley's field kitchen." Two 
officers who had recently passed successfully through the 
Garrison course of instruction were accordingly sent for, 
and, as a personal favour to the Commanding Officer, 
requested to go out to the camping ground, and lay out a 
series of broad-arrow kitchens for the Regiment. The 



CERTAIN KITCHEN REQUISITES. 19 

work was done, and we marclied into camp the next day. 
Whilst the men were busy at stables, the Colonel rode about 
inspecting everything ; presently he came uj^on the neatly 
excavated kitchens, but, to his astonishment, found them 
deserted ! N'ot a cook was to be seen ! Orderlies flew to 
find out where on earth the men's breakfasts were being 
cooked, and in a few minutes, the whole corjps de cuisine was 
discovered squatting at work more suo in a dry nullah hard 
by. The Colonel furiously demanded why the proper kitch- 
ens had not been used, and " all this abominable mess 
prevented ?" Presently a cook of greater daring than his 
colleagues replied " What sar ! that had sense kitchin, sar, 
I beg your pardon : too much jireioood tahing : see sar this 
prdper kitchin only.'' In the face of such an irresistible 
argument, the Colonel (albeit irritated beyond measure) 
was constrained to abandon his cherished project. 

When presenting Ramasamy, therefore, with novel uten- 
sils, let us guard against his denouncing them as " bad 
sense." We must patiently show him how to use them, 
proving, if we possibly can, by practical illustration, the 
satisfactory results, saving of time, and so forth, to be 
gained by their means. Anything complicated should, of 
course, be avoided. 

As far as my personal experience goes, I confess that 
I have found Ramasamy by no means diflicult to teach. 

All native cooks take readily to the mincing machine, 
and I find that my chef fully appreciates the vegetable 
cutter, root-knife, dishing-up fork, gravy strainer, wire 
sieve, hair sieve, colander, mortar, wire frying basket, 
" Warren's fish kettle and vegetable steamer," and the 
larding needle, which he can use easily. Larding is one 
of the branches of the cook's art which comes naturally 
to a native ; as a rule also I think that they surpass 



20 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

Europeans in boning poultry, an operation wliich Martha 
rarely attempts. 

I cannot too strongly recommend tlie adoption of that 
invaluable utensil a " bain-marie,'^ or shallow trough, 
which, filled with hot-water and kept over a moderate 
fire, affords a hot bath in which the various little sauce- 
pans containing sauces, etc., can be set, and so kept hot 
without deterioration. A hain-marie complete, with a set 
of saucepans made to fit it, can be purchased at any hard- 
ware shop, or you can have one made to order to fit your 
saucepans in copper, iron, or block tin ; the first material 
will, of course, outlast the other two. 

The digester is a vessel that may be given to Ramasamy 
without hesitation ; and he is keenly alive to the value of 
the stew-pan. In the matter of frying-pans he is not 
hypercritical : I do not think that he perceives the differ- 
ence between a/ri7?tre-pan and an 07)ie?e^ie-pan. He dis- 
likes anything heavy, and generally asks for a small iron 
pan. I quite agi'ee with a friend whose experience in 
culinary matters is great, who advocates a deep-sided, 
heavy iron frying-vessel, — a frying Icettle, in short, rather 
than the ordinary frying-^^an of commerce, steady over the 
fire on account of its own weight, — for all res! friture work, 
and, of course, a handy vessel for saute work with a still 
lighter one for omelettes. The large pan he recommends 
can be made in any Indian bazar, and, when used in con- 
junction with the frying basket, will certainly be found 
most valuable. Like many English cooks, the native is 
apt to discard the gridiron and take the frying-pan for 
many things which ought invariably to be cooked in the 
former vessel : this tendency requires watching, for in 
many of the receipts I shall give, broiling is essential. 

I hesitate to pronounce any opinion upon the metal best 
adapted for kitchen utensils, for, upon this point different

21 



people think differently. Copper is, we all know, uni- 
versally recommended on account of its durability. You 
see nothing else in the kitchens of restaurants, clubs, &c., 
and in all establishments where the demands upon the chef 
are frequent and elaborate. If treated with ordinary 
care, no evil should result from its use. Enamelled iron- 
ware looks nice when new, but the slightest carelessness 
destroys the enamel, and when once cracked, it may be 
considered done for. Plain wrought-iron vessels, tinned, 
are serviceable, and block tin for certain utensils is not to 
be despised. The lately introduced grey enamel ware 
is likewise serviceable, and at the same time light. In my 
own kitchen, I have a mixed collection which answei^ its 
purpose well enough. 

With regard to the equipment necessary for an ordinary 
establishment, I can safely recommend : —

One mincing machine, and a tin box with divisions 
for a small supply of pepper-corns, salt, ground pepper, 
sugar, &c. 

A wooden slab, (or marble if you can get one) for pastry, 
with rolling pin is necessary, and also a pestle and mortar. 
A stone or iron one is best for India ; I have lost two 
Wedgwood mortars — broken through careless use on a 
stone-paved floor. 

I strongly recommend that every cook should have at 
least four common earthenware bowls, two of them with 
lips, for setting stock, gravies, &c., &c., and it will be 
found as well to give him a few cheap crockery sundries 
for exclusive use in his kitchen. If not, portions of your 
breakfast and dinner sets will find their way to the cook- 
room, and the list of killed, wounded, and missing will 
become alarming. I think the following sufficient for a 
small kitchen : two jugs, two cups and saucers, a wine-glass 
for measurement, six plates, three soup plates, two large 
and two small dishes, two small basins, and three wire

covers to protect meat, &c., from flies : these articles may 
obviously be of the commonest ware or of enamelled iron. 

A cupboard fitted with a lock and key should be given 
to the cook for the safe custody of the many small articles 
I have enumerated, and a set of shelves for his utensils. 
The cook-room table should be roomy and strong, and to 
ensure its cleanliness, it should be continually scalded 
down with boiling water and soda, and well rubbed over 
with sand paper. 

Lastly, no kitchen should be without a clock. A cook 
of ordinary intelligence can, without difficulty, be taught 
to mark the progTess of the hands, and work by time, 
rather than by guess-work. 

It is hardly necessary, I hope, for me to point out the 
intense importance of cleanliness in the kitchen, and in all 
utensils connected therewith. If you cannot go to the 
kitchen yourself, it is essential that you should hold weekly 
inspections of all your cooking utensils, which should be 
spread out on a mat in the verandah for that purpose. 
Give out ivashing soda, for you cannot keep things clean 
without it ; and be very particular about the cloths that 
are used by the cook. There is a horrible taste which 
sometimes clings to soups, sauces, etc., which a friend of 
mine specifies as " dirty cloth taste." This is eloquent of 
neglect, and dirty habits in the kitchen. Sieves will do 
for many things, but there are some compositions which 
must be strained through cloths, we cannot, therefore, be 
too attentive with reference to that part of our kitchen 
equipment. 

For a few remarks concerning our kitchens in India, 
please turn to the end of the book.

In the Sfore-room.

N visiting: the vast collections of tinned provisions, 
sauces, &c., at some of the large establishments at 
the Presidency, I have often wondered liow a lady, 
commencing honse-kecping, is gnided in selecting the 
things she requires for her store-room. A majority, no 
doubt, of the fair chatelaines of Madras, do their shopping 
at their boudoir writing tables, filling up lists at the dic- 
tation of the butler at their elbow ; for few, I take it, — • 
very few care to go to the fountain head for what they 
want. 

Now, a butler's ideas about stores are, on the whole, very 
mixed : he worships " Europe articles" and delights in 
filling the shelves of the store-room with rows of tins ; of 
which some may perhaps be useful, but many need never 
be bought at all at Madras, and so remain for months un- 
touched, lumbering the shelves of the cupboard. It has 
struck me, therefore, that having satisfied oui'selves con- 
cerning the equipment of the kitchen, a few words regard- 
ing the choosing of stores may be acceptable. 

I have long come to the conclusion that the fewer acces- 
sories you use in the way of hermetically sealed provisions 
in the cooking of a dinner the better. In Madras we have 
all the materials for soup-making at hand, we have ex- 
cellent fish, very fail* flesh and fowl, good wild fowl and

game when in season, and vegetables from Bangalore and 
the Neilgherries in addition to the standard produce of 
the country. If, therefore, we concentrate our attention 
sufficiently upon what we can get from market, our 
demand on tinned food should be very small indeed. 

Take now, for instance, a tin of the ordinary preserved 
mushrooms, — those made you know of white leather, — 
what is the use of them, what do they taste of ? Yet 
people giving a dinner party frequently garnish one entree 
at least with them, and the Madras butler would be 
horrified if his mistress were to refuse him that pleasure. 
The stewed " black Leicestershire" are the best preserved 
mushrooms to be had, but even between them and the 
fresh fujigus, there is a great gulf fixed. 

A few years ago I met an officer of the Artillery, who, 
after having served in various parts of the world, had just 
been appointed to a command in this Presidency. Con- 
versation happened to turn upon cookery, and the Colonel 
soon proved himself to be a man who had for years studied 
the science con amore. He had had little or no experience 
of Indian life, and he expressed himself agi^eeably sur- 
prised, rather than otherwise, at the style of living to 
which he had been introduced. " But," he said, " preserve 
me from your dinners of ceremony." He had arrived, 
he told me, quite unexpectedly a few evenings before, and 
had been at once invited to the Mess ; the dinner, — just 
the ordinary daily one, — was, he thought, excellent, and 
so it was the next day, and the day following, but on the 
fourth day he was formally invited to dine as a Mess 
guest, and that was a very different affair. Considerable 
expense had been incurred, he observed, on this occasion 
in tinned provisions, but with the worst possible result. 
There was a dish of preserved salmon hot, and sodden ; the 
entrees were spoilt by the introduction of terrible sausages, 

3 



26 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

and muslirooms ; and the tinned vegetables were mined 
by being -wrongly treated by the cook. " There are few 
men," the Colonel went on, " who have had more to do 
with preserved provisions than I have, but until I attended 
this big Indian dinner, I never saw such things actually 
regarded as delicacies, and put upon the table to the exclu- 
sion of the good fresh food procurable in the market." 
This is the proper way of looking at this question. There 
will be times and places, when and where you will be 
obliged to fall back upon Messrs. Crosse and Blackwell, and 
be thankful. Until those evil days come upon you, how- 
ever, do not anticipate your penance, but strive to make 
the food you can easily procui-e, palatable and good by 
scientific treatment. 

I look upon tinned provisions in the hands of Rama- 
samy as the cloaks of carelessness, and slovenly cooking. 
He thinks that the * tin' will cover a multitude of sins, so 
takes comparatively little pains with the dish that it 
accompanies. 

There are many ladies who, when giving out stores for 
a dinner party, have no hesitation in issuing ' tins' to the 
value of many rupees, but if asked for extra cream, butter, 
eggs, and gravy-meat, — the true essentials of cookery, — 
begin to consider themselves imposed upon. The poverty 
of our cookery in India results almost wholly from our 
habit of ignoring these things, the very backbone, as it 
were, of the cook's art. If an English cook, surrounded 
with the best market supplies in the world, be helpless 
without her stock, her kitchen butter, and her cream and 
eggs, how much more should Ramasamy be pitied if he 
be refused those necessaries, for his materials stand in 
far greater need of assistance. 

In the matter of firewood and charcoal too, I am aware 
that there is often a difierence of opinion between the 



IN THE STORE-ROOM. 27 

cook and his mistress, and I am inclined to think that 
Ramasamy is generally in the wi'ong. Still, we should be 
careful lest we limit his supply of fuel too closely — espe- 
cially on a dinner party day. I once was a guest at a 
house where the dinner was served perfectly as far as the 
joint, when a sudden collapse took place ; the game and 
dressed vegetable were stone-cold. The excuse the next 
day was, " charcoal all done finish, and Missis only got 
godown key in the pocket." 

Unless you have tried to find out practically what can 
be done with the fish, flesh, fowl, and vegetables of this 
country, by studious cookery, you will scarcely believe the 
extent of your power, and how independent you really are 
of preserved provisions. It is absolutely annoying to read 
the nonsense people write about our style of living in 
India. I remember an article headed " Curry and Rice" 
which once appeared in Vanity Fair. The writer wrecked 
on the rock upon which many drift, who, with a little 
knowledge of the peculiarities of some particular part of 
the country, sit down with impudent confidence to treat of 
India generally, quite forgetting that the Peninsula is a 
large one, and that the manners and customs which obtain 
in one district, may never have been heard of in other 
parts of the Empire. The article was not applicable to 
any part of the Madras Presidency, and judging from the 
^T:'iter's suggestions as to the cookery of a tin of beef with 
yams, and worse still, the fabrication of soup from the 
fowl hones you piclced and left at luncTieon, I should say 
that Vanity had picked up not only an ignoramus, but an 
uncleanly ignoramus, as a contributor. Our friends at 
Home were told by this audacious man that no dinner was 
complete in India without a " bui^ning curry," and that 
none was successful " without Europe tins." I think that, 
as we go on, I shall be able to prove that at Madras, at 
ail events, we can do pretty well without either. 



28 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

Altliougli I am strongly against the use of tinned things 
to the extent that many allow, there are nevertheless 
many articles Trhich you must have in the store-room : — 
pickles, sauces, jams, bacon, cheese, maccaroni, vermicelli, 
vinegars, flavouring essences, the invaluable truffle, tart 
fruits, biscuits, isinglass, arrowroot, oatmeal, pearl barley, 
cornflour, olives, capers, dined herbs, and so on. Grated 
Parmesan cheese (sold in bottles by Crosse and Blackwell) 
should never be forgotten, the salad oil should be the best 
procurable, and no store-room should be without tarragon 
vinegar, ancho\y vinegar, French vinegar, and white wine 
vinegar. Amongst sauces I consider " Harvey" the best 
for general use ; Sutton's " Empress of India," is a strong 
sauce with a real flavour of mushrooms ; Moir's sauces and 
" Reading sauce" are very trustworthy, and there are 
otliei*s which, no doubt, commend themselves to different 
palates, but I denounce " Worcester sauce" and " Tapp's 
sauce" as agents far too powerful to be trusted to the hands 
of the native cook. Sutton's essence of anchovies is said 
to possess the charm of not clotting, or forming a stoppage 
in the neck of the bottle. I have a deep respect for both 
walnut and mushroom ketchup, soy, and tomato conserve. 
Then as special trifles, we must not forget caviare, olives 
farcies J and anchovies in oil. 

The cook should be carefully shown the use of flavour- 
ing essences, and also that of dried herbs. He ought 
also to be taught never to run out of bread crumbs. Stale 
fine crumbs should be made every now and then, and kept 
corked down in bottles for use when required. The very 
unsightly appearance presented by fish, cutlets, etc., 
crumbed with fresh spongy crumbs should warn us, for 
stale bread is never to be had when we suddenly want it. 
Red currant jelly is very useful ; the store-room should 
never be " out" of it. I shall treat of tinned vegetables 
hereafter in their proper place. Macedoines, fonds d^arti- 



IN THE STORE-ROOM. 29 

chaitf, petits pois, haricots verts and asperges are, of course, 
excellent, and the dried Julienne will be found admirable 
for sonps. Preserved fisli is not required at Madras, and 
we can get on without tinned meats, soups, and potted 
luxuries, for we can make better things at home. 

In sweet things, however, we are not so independent, 
and jams, jellies, tart-fruits, dried and candied peel, 
currants, raisins, ginger, &c., &c., must all have room in 
the house-keeper's cupboard. 

Of the invaluable qualities to the Anglo-Indian of good 
tinned butter, I shall speak on a future occasion. 

In a chapter on stores it is impossible to pass over, 
without a few words of commendation, the excellent pre- 
served fish, vegetables, and fruits, which have, of late, been 
imported from America, Besides being capital in quality 
these " canned" delicacies are decidedly cheap. The old 
English firms have now to compete with dangerous rivals. 
Let them look to their laurels. 

Messrs. Brand & Co.'s preparations for invalids, potted 
meats, soups, and strong essences of beef, chicken, &c., are 
specialites in their way vastly superior to anything for- 
merly in the market of a like description. Messrs. Moir 
and Son have however taken up the subject recently with 
great success.

On Stock, and clear Soups. 

"X'lrtT'ITH a keen appreciation of the importance of the 
jlO^ subject, and of the difficulties with which it is 
surrounded, I now proceed to place before mj 
readers a little collection of hints and wrinkles about 
soup-making which I have gathered from time to time 
from a variety of sources. Some, by practical experience, 
gained by hond fide work in the kitchen, some given to 
me by friends, and some picked out of different works on 
the culinary art. In my extracts from books, I shall 
endeavoui' to record, as much as possible, such advice 
only as I have tested myself, and I shall try to make my 
gleanings simple and concise. 

To begin then ; there are, we know, three distinct 
classes of soups : — the clear, the thick, and the 'puree. We 
recognise clear soups in the menu under different names. 
For instance, we meet consomme cle volaille, and potage a la 
printaniere, but whereas the word consomme is invariably 
applied to clear soups, we find potage frequently used for 
thick also, to wit : — potage a la Reine, potage a la bonne 
femme, §t. Let us distinguish between thick soups and 
purees in this way : — The former owe their consistency to 
the addition of some artificial thickening, such as flour, 
egg yolks, &c., the latter, on the other hand, derive their 
thick characteristic from the ingredients that compose 
them being rubbed through a tamis, or through a wire \

sieve, and, communicated to the stock in the form of a 
thick pulp, as in the case of puree dl artichautSy 'puree de 
legumes, puree de gihier, §"0. A soup partaking of the 
character of a thinnish puree helped up by artificial aid in 
the way of thickening, is called by some writers a potage 
a la puree. The hisgue again is a puree, strictly speaking, 
of Cray fish (mix ecrevisses) or of lobster (de liomard), but 
it can be made successfully with crab, prawns, and 
shrimps ; indeed a nice hisgue can be made with any fish. — 
So much for names. 

Let us now turn our attention to beef consomme for we 
may regard it as the foundation upon which nearly every 
soup is based. 

" Stock," says a capital writer on cookery, " is to a cook 
what the medium or the water is to the painter in oils or 
in water colours. It may be defined, generally speaking, 
as a solution in water of the nutritive, and sapid elements 
contained in meat and bones : salt and spices added to it to 
make it savoury, and if to this you add the flavour of 
various vegetables, you have soup." 

"We must remember, however, to start with, that soup in 
India must be made in one day. We cannot fall back upon 
the never-empty stock pot of the English kitchen : our's 
must be made daily, and, to guard against waste, only in 
sufficient quantity for the day's consumption. In saying 
this I have, of course, mainly before me the climate of 
Madras, and of the plains of Southern India. At the Hill 
stations and during the cold weather in the northern part 
of the country, the method obtaining in British households 
may, no doubt, with care, and slight modification, be fol- 
lowed. 

Our soup, then, being actually an ephemeral production, 
how should we proceed ? " For the type of all stock- 
making," says the Gr. C. " there can be no better recipe 
taken then that of the French pot-au-feu,'' let us therefore 



32 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

consider attentively the following recipe for that most 
valuable of culinary operations. 

Put a piece of soup-meat, — say of four pounds weight, in 
the proportion of three pounds of flesh to one of bone, — 
(the recipe can, of course, be followed by adding or reducing 
as you may require but preserving like proportion) tightly 
bound with a string, with two ounces of salt and the bones 
separately broken up, into a stock pot filled with water, so 
as to completely cover the meat. Put the pot by the side 
of the fire and let it become gradually heated. As this 
takes place, a scum will form upon the surface which must 
be carefully removed as it rises. When nearly boiling, a 
coffee cupful of cold water should be thrown into the pot 
to accelerate the rising of the scum. The clearness of the 
soup will depend remember, upon all the scum being 
taken off, and upon the water being kept from boiling 
point until it is all removed. This having been done ; 
put into the saucepan the following vegetables which 
should have been previously carefully cleaned and cut up, 
viz. : — a couple of large white onions, a clove of garlic, two 
large or three small carrots, two or three turnips, six leeks, 
one head of celery, a bunch of cm'ly parsley, and two cloves 
in the onion. Then put in, tied up in a piece of muslin, 
some thyme, marjoram, and a handful of whole pepper, 
— a tea-spoonful each of dried thyme and marjoram will 
be quite enough. It will be found that by adding the 
vegetables, the boiling of the broth will be thrown back ; 
as soon however as the bubbling recommences, watch the 
vegetables carefully, and remove them when they are done. 
If you leave them in the stock pot after they have been 
cooked, they will spoil the soup. Remove the muslin bag 
also. You can next put in a dessert-spoonful of sugar, a 
table-spoonful of Harvey sauce, and two of mushroom 
ketchup ; when the pot-au-fen is, so to speak, thus com- 
pleted, it must be left to simmer slowly from three to four 



ON STOCK, AND CLEAR SOUPS. 33 

honrs. The sonp should now be strained into a basin and 
left to get cool, so that any remaining fat may be effect- 
ually skimmed off. The clear liquor is then fit to be warm- 
ed and served with maccaroni, bread sippets, or vegetables, 
&c., according to the kind of soup you wish to have. 

Observe that in order to carry out this recipe, an open, 
roomy vessel is necessary; a closed pot like a digester 
must not be used. 

This is, to my mind, the simplest recipe you can follow 
to achieve a bright clear consomme. It is, of course, im- 
perative that you proceed exactly as described. First, 
the meat covered with cold water, and brought very slow- 
ly to the boil, being very carefully skimmed the while. 
Next, when the skimming is completed, the vegetables, — 
to be removed when done, the little bouquet of sweet herbs, 
the sugar, and a small allowance of sauce and ketchup. 
Now, a period of three hours to simmer, followed by 
straining. The liquor you have after this is actually beef 
consomme or strong broth quite clear and pale. 

Removing the fat whilst the simmering is going on is 
obviously a very important stage which cannot be too 
patiently manipulated. The fat so obtained is invaluable 
for frying purposes. It should be melted after it has 
settled, and strained through a piece of muslin. 

It may so happen that, owing to insufficient skimming 
in the early stage of the proceedings, you find to your 
sori'ow that the consomme is not as clear as you could wish. 
You must therefore clarify it. There are two good ways of 
doing this. The simpler, and I believe, the more effica- 
cious of the two is to put into the cool broth some very 
small fragments of raw beef, free from fat, put it on the 
fire again till it boils, let it settle, and then strain. Per- 
haps, however, you may not have saved a bit of meat for 
this contingency, so you must attain your object with the 



34 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

white of an egg^ thus : — Break an egg, and throw the 
white and the shell together into a slop basin, — be care- 
ful not to let an atom of the yolk go in, — beat the white 
and shell np to a stiff froth, and mix it, flake by flake, 
very completely with the cool sonp. Put the soup into a 
saucepan, and set it on the fire, stirring well till it boils. 
Take it off immediately, cover it close, let it stand for a 
quarter of an hour, and then strain it off through the 
tamis, or hair sieve. 

Let me here point out the cause of another misadven- 
ture in the satisfactory appearance of a clear soup, — one 
that often occurs in consomme with maccaroni, verm.icelli, 
and pearl-barley. You have got your stock as bright and 
clear as sherry, but after adding the ingredients just men- 
tioned " a change comes over the spirit of your dream," — 
the soup turns cloudy. The reason is this : preserved fari- 
naceous food of the maccaroni class often contains dirt, 
— dirt that you do not perceive, and which can only be 
removed by parboiling. Accordingly, whenever you in- 
tend to add it to consomme, you should hoil it independently 
in plain water in order that the outside dirty part may be 
washed off by becoming dissolved. Plain washing in 
water is not enough ; besides, loashing maccaroni is the 
act of an ignoramus. 

There is another feature in a clear soup which I have 
reserved for special attention, and that is the colouring. 
Now, an idea prevails amongst numbers of English people 
that a soup to be good and strong must be dark-coloured. 
Old-fashioned people speak of your modern consomme as a 
weak, washy composition only fit for foreigners. But if 
you take the very self-same liquor and brown it with a 
lot of burnt onion, and thicken it with flour and butter, 
they are perfectly satisfied. Did you ever make jug- 
ged beef tea for a sick friend, the strongest possible 
essence of raw lean beef ? Was not the liquor so obtained 



ON STOCK, AND CLEAR SOUPS. 35 

as clear as sherry, pale-coloured, with a quantity of 
granulated particles of the beef floating in it ? Well, 
when strained that would have been consomme without 
the flavouring produced from vegetables and the bouquet 
of sweet herbs, and surely s^'DJ^gf enough for the veriest 
John Bull that ever talked nonsense about cookery. 

Now, if you desire to impart a golden brown tint to your 
clear soup, or a darker tint, (which the gods forfend) 
never use hurnt onion upon any account. Tou must achieve 
your object by a browning (caramel) made thus : — put 
a quarter pound of white sugar into a copper or enamelled 
pan ; set it over the fire, and stir it till it is melted ; then 
after simmering for a quarter of an hour, and it has reach- 
ed the brown tint you want, add a pint of water to it, boil, 
and skim it, let it get cold, and then bottle and cork it down 
for use. A little of this should be put into the soup prior 
to the three hours' simmering stage, if a golden brown be 
the tint desired. 

If you can obtain a small bottle of French-made sue 
colorant, you need not trouble your head about the colour- 
ing, for a little of that exquisite preparation will colour, 
and also slightly improve the flavour of your consomme. 
Messrs. Moir and Son now provide this useful ingredient. 

Grated Parmesan or Gruyere cheese should always be 
handed round with clear soups, for it improves many of 
them. Chilli- vinegar in minute particles is considered by 
some a great improvement. I strongly advise any of my 
readers who write to England for their stores, not to 
forget to ask for a little bottle of American " Tabasco,'' or 
quintessence of cayenne, sold by Messrs. Jackson and Co., 
Piccadilly, priced half a crown : each bottle is furnished 
with a patent stopper to enable you to shake out a drop at 
a time ; two drops in each basin of soup is generally found 
enough, and the flavour is very good, quite superseding 
chilli- vinegar for this purpose. 



36 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

The next important feature for consideration in soup- 
making is the adding of ivine, which, I think, may be 
regarded as very essential. Madeira or Marsala is better 
than sherry for most soups. A rich, full, fruity wine, — 
inexpensive for want of age, and scarcely to be recom- 
mended for after dinner drinking, — is the class best adapted 
for kitchen use. If sherry be preferred, it ought to be a 
fruity one, and sound, not a cheap extraordinary compound, 
composed of molasses, washings of sherry casks, and the 
most villainous brandy ; but honest sherry, lacking age, 
perhaps, yet hond fide wine. " There is a good saying," 
observes an author on cookery, that is appropriate here : — 
" It is no use spoiling the ship for the sake of a ha'porth 
of tar," — it is, I think, no use spoiling a good soup for the 
sake of a spoonful of wine." Be careful, however, not to 
overdo the soupr^on of wine that you add to a clear soup ; 
a good table-spoonful is, to my mind, enough for a tureen 
filled for eight persons. Thick soups, especially those 
made of game, mock-turtle, giblet, kidney, and the like, 
take a larger share of wine : hare soup requires port or 
burgundy, wild duck and teal soup also, whilst potages of 
snipe, partridges, quails, jungle-fowls, &c., are, I think, 
better enriched with Madeii-a, or Marsala. 

I have hitherto purposely omitted saying anything con- 
cerning the treatment of the meat and vegetables of which 
a pot-au-feio is made, being anxious to keep strictly to the 
subject which we have been discussing, — the cookery of a 
clear consomme. Before I go on with soup-making, how- 
ever, I beg par parenthSse as it were, to turn back to that 
period in the preparation of the soup when we strained the 
consomme from the meat, bones, and vegetables, which had 
made it. 

In the Madras kitchen the soup-meat is regarded, I 
believe, as the perquisite of the cook's maty, which, being 
interpreted, may be understood to mean really that of the 



ON STOCK, AND CLEAR SOUPS. 37 

cook himself. Wlietlier this custom be susceptible of reform 
or not, I hesitate to say, but there can be no doubt at all that, 
by giving way to it, we often deny ourselves a dish which 
would be exceedingly nice for a change, — one which, on the 
continent, is sent to table as a matter of course. 

In small establishments, or for the quiet dinner alone, 
I can strongly recommend a trial of home-made houilli, 
which should be treated in this way : — 

Let us assume that the recipe for pot-au-feu has been 
strictly carried out as far as the straining stage, and that all 
the vegetables, or as many of them as were procurable, 
have been used : now, place the meat on a dish, remove 
the string that bound it, and serve it upon a bed of mac- 
caroni previously boiled till tender, and a puree obtained by 
rubbing all the vegetables through the wire sieve, mois- 
tened with a portion of the bouillon or consomme ; or on a 
bed of stewed cabbage, with the other vegetables neatly 
arranged round it, in the clear broth. 

Don't rush away with the Anglo-Saxon idea that there 
is no " goodness" (Martha's word) in soup-meat, " There 
is," sa,ys the G-. C, " as much nutriment in it, when eaten 
with the soup it has yielded, as there would have been, 
had it been roasted ; and much more than if it had been 
converted into salt junk, as it is the English custom to do 
with the silverside of beef." You can vary the houilli by 
tomato sauce, any piquante sauce, or even souhise. The 
soup-meat served with maccaroni, grated Parmesan, and 
furee of tomatoes is the favourite " manzo guernito'' of the 
Italian dinner. 

Talking of soup-meat, does every one know that the 
potted meats so largely exported, and commonly appre- 
ciated in this country, are made from the meat of which 
the tinned soups are composed ? It is a fact nevertheless, 
and every atom of meat is thus turned to account by the 

4 



38 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

preserved provision dealers. The potted meat you see in 
a confectioner's window at home, neatly capped with 
melted butter, is made from the beef which produced the 
stock of the mock-turtle (I bet anything it is " mock- 
turtle,") he advertises at a shilling a basin — enterprising 
man ! I once tested this myself. Having before me a 
large piece of soup-meat apparently full of nutriment, I 
determined as an experiment, to make potted meat of it. 
Martha, my cook, looked sourly on, — I little knew that I 
was robbing her of the price of that meat from the nearest 
pastry-cook, — and called it, for her part, a " hawful mess" ; 
but we, who ate it, found it delicious. In London, and all 
large towns in England, a regular private trade in soup- 
meat, dripping, and fragments, is carried on between our 
cooks and the keepers of refreshment rooms, which both 
parties regard as perfectly legitimate. 

But to return to the subject of soups. Although we 
may succeed in mastering the difficulties of the cotisomme, 
or foundation of soup-making, we must not forget that our 
work may be spoiled by the introduction of some barbarism 
peculiar to the Indian kitchen. An idea prevails with 
Bome people that clear soups require to be assisted with 
gelatine, or isinglass, to give them a sort of glutinous con- 
sistency. Ramasamy has discovered a very pernicious sort 
of starch which he produces from a raw-potato, and by this 
compound the soup in many houses, I know, is ruined. The 
potato imparts a crude, inky flavour to the consomme which 
is hard to describe on paper, but is fatal in its effect upon 
the palate. It kills all the flavour of the meat and vege- 
tables. Ramasamy should be cautioned on no account to 
use what he calls " potato-thickening" again, in any cir- 
cumstances whatever, and, once for all, let me observe 
that clear soups require no isinglass. The consomme cannot 
be too bright, light, and clear. 

*' Countiy parsley," to my mind, spoils any soup. It is 



ON STOCK, AND CLEAR SOUPS. 39 

nearly as bad as too mncli spice, and nnforttLnately our 
natives are very fond of it. I have interdicted its use in 
my kitchen under pain of a fine. Tarragon is the best 
flavouring herb you can use in a clear soup, (consomme ct 
VestragoTi) but we have only the vinegar in India, not the 
plant itself, and a leaf or two is, what we desire in soup. 
I brought out from England and have also received by 
post, some dried tarragon leaves which I have found highly 
satisfactory, and can safely recommend others to try. 
Unfortunately tarragon is not included in Crosse and 
Blackwell's dried herb list, so you must write, if suffi- 
ciently enthusiastic, to a friend who has a large kitchen 
garden, and beg him to fill a bottle or two with tarragon 
leaves carefully dried for you. In London any green- 
grocer can comply with this order from June till the end 
of October.* 

Basil, which can be procured in bottles, is the best 
herb for clear mock turtle, and other clear soups made 
of shell-fish. 

I will now conclude this, my fii'st chapter on soup- 
making, with a code of general rules on the subject : — 

1. Take care that your stock pot, a roomy vessel, is 
thoroughly clean before you commence operations ; — a 
good scalding with hot-water in which a lump of washing 
soda has been dissolved, will make matters certain, and 
take away that smoky taint which all our utensils get in 
India owing to our wood fires, and chimneyless ranges. 

2. Use soft water rather than hard, 

3. One shin of Indian beef is enough for two persons, 
two shins ought to suffice for six, and so on. 

4. Put the fresh soup-meat with the bones separately 
broken up, and the salt, into cold-water : hot (not boiling) 

* Since this was written in 1878, Messrs. Moir and Son have intro- 
duced the di-ied herb in bottles which will be found excellent. — W. 



40 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

water should be pom-ed round meat and bones that have 
been previously cooked. 

5. A quart of water to half a pound of meat and bone 
is said to be the outside you can allow in England, but a 
smaller proportion will be found advisable in India — a 
quart to a pound for instance. In any circumstances 
there must be sufficient water to cover the meat and bone. 

6. Remember that slow boiling, and retarding actual 
boiling as much as possible, are important points to start 
with. 

7. Do not cover up your pot closely, the steam should 
evaporate t-o assist the strength of the soup, and keep 
it clear, 

8. Skim frequently during the early stage of your pro- 
ceedings, — a cup of cold-water thrown into the pot causes 
the scum, or albumen, to come up quickly, and, of coui-se, 
retards boiling. 

9. Use a wooden spoon. 

10. Put in your vegetables, flavouring herbs, &c., after 
the skimming is finished, and let them simmer till they 
are done. 

11. Wash your vegetables very carefully before adding 
them. 

12. As soon as the vegetables which arc put into the 
pot-aii-feu are done, they should be removed, and the heat 
under the soup-kettle maintained at simmering point. 

13. It will take four or five hours to extract the essence 
from a few pounds of beef, so begin as soon as you can, 
and don't hurry the work. 

14. It is better to season too little than too highly, so 
be very careful when adding pepper, herbs, &c. 



ON STOCK, AND CLEAR SOUPS. 41 

15. There is nothing to be gained by keeping the meat 
simmering when once it is thoroughly done. The consomrne 
is at its best when the meat which made it is done to a 
nicety, viz., in about five hours. Boiling " to rags" is a 
useless proceeding. 

N.B. — Remember that you will never succeed in obtain- 
ing a nicely flavoured clear soup, unless the proportions of 
meat and vegetables are carefully maintained. For three 
pounds of meat and one of bone, Gouffe gives the following 
weights of vegetables : — carrots, ten ounces ; large onions, 
ten ounces ; leeks, fourteen ounces ; celery, one ounce ; 
turnips, ten ounces ; parsnip, two ounces. 

As leeks are not often found in the Madras market, I 
would substitute another large onion, about five ounces. 
Parsnips are only procurable on the ISTeilgherries, their 
weight may be made up with some extra carrot. Turnips, 
unless gathered fresh and young, are a2:)t to be very strong 
in India ; I think, therefore, that five ounces of them will 
be found sufiicient as a rule. Observe the weight allowed 
of celery ; — this is important, for celery is a very power- 
fully flavoured vegetable. 

Concerning vegetable consomme, I speak later on. 

Have the rules, I have given, together with the weigTits 
of meat and vegetables, and the recipe for pot-au-feu, 
written out in Tamil by your butler and pasted upon 
card-board, to be hung in the cook-room for Ramasamy's 
edification whose self-taught method of soup-making may 
be briefly described as follows : — 

He cuts up the soup-meat, and bone, and throws them 
into the digester pot ; he next adds the vegetables, pepper, 
salt and spice, covers the whole with water, puts the vessel 
screwed down on a good brisk fire, and walks off to Ms 
rice, leaving his tumiycutch to watch the boiling. All she 
does is to see that there is plenty of firewood under the 



42 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

digester. As may readily be supposed boiling point is 
speedily reached in this way of managing matters. In an 
hour or so the cook returns and finds the water he put into 
the pot reduced to about one-third of its original quantity ; 
this is, of course, a very strong broth, he accordingly 
strains it off, and calls it his " first sort gravy." He then 
returns the meat, &c., to the pot again, covers it with 
water, and lets that boil away. The liquid thus produced, 
I need scarcely say, is terrible to look upon, and very nasty 
to taste, the whole essence of the meat having been fritter- 
ed away by the first process. It is a dull, gi-easy-looking 
fluid like dish washings. Nevertheless Ramasamy strains 
it off and calls it the " second sort gravy." He next amal- 
gamates the two " sorts," browns the mixture with burnt 
onion, and clarifies it with the white of an e^g. Having 
got it clear, he rasps some raw potato into it to obtain a 
nice glutinous starch, and when the soup seems sufficiently 
gummy, he strains once more and sends it to table. 

Setting aside other considerations, pray observe the 
wastefulness of this awful process. It is not exaggeration 
to say that half the quantity of soup-meat and bone 
required by the ignorant native cook might be saved if he 
could be prevailed upon to follow the laws of intelligent 
cookery.

Thick soups and purees. 

OW about thick soups, apart from purees : — these 
are perhaps more popular with the majority of 
English people, than the thin clear. There is an 
expression of richness and of strength in them which 
cannot fail to captivate the Briton. He, therefore, that 
would gratify his countrymen, must frequently offer them 
a soup which is in itself a meal. 

I made the acquaintance of a little French woman in 
London whose husband kept a pastry cook's shop and was 
a chef indeed. Asking one day in a hurry for any clear 
soup they could give me, Madame Gregoire arched her 
eyebrows and said " Ah ! vi'sieur it would not pay us to 
make for our customers the consomme. Ox-tail, mock-tur- 
tle, and puree de pois we have ready ; for a clear soup, we 
must have notice of a few hours." And we exchanged 
our regrets that Englishmen could not appreciate, even in 
the midst of July, Si potage a la printaniere. 

Still I confess that a thick soup is acceptable at times : 
— In cool weather ; when you return as hungry as a 
hunter from some physical enterprise ; or when you have 
a little cosy dinner of only a very few items to discuss — a 
soup, a slice of a joint, a dressed vegetable, and your 
cheese. But I hesitate to recommend soups of this class 
for a Madras dinner party, — to be placed before men whose 



44 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

labours all day have been sedentary, and ladies who have 
lunched well, and passed their day in graceful repose. 
And it is mainly for them, be it remembered, that I com- 
pose what a friendly critic terms my " menus mi gowns.'' 

There is one feature about thick soups which is worthy 
of attention, and that is that you need not be so scrupu- 
lously careful in the making of the stock, or in selecting 
the materials of which the stock is made, for you have 
not to think of that clearness which is the salient feature 
of your consomme. Thick soups can therefore, be made 
of the bones of cooked meat, and scraps that would never 
do for potage a la Julienne for instance. 

Let us take as a type of a really good thick soup that 
called potage a la bonne femme, which, is made in this 
way. Prepare a quart of stock, and keep that by your 
side : now cut up a good-sized (Bombay) onion into very 
thin rounds, and place them in a sauce-pan with two 
ounces of good tinned butter. Take care not to let the 
onion get brown, and when it is half done, throw in a 
quarter of a pound of sorrel leaves, a lettuce, and a bunch 
of parsley, all finely shred, add pepper, salt, half an ounce 
of flour, and keep stirring for five minutes. You then 
add a dessert-spoonful of pounded loaf-sugar, and half a 
cupful of the stock, freed from fat, and not coloured. Let 
the mixture reduce nearly to a glaze, when you gradually 
stir in about a quart of the stock ; and let the soup simmer 
for a quarter of an hour. You now must prepare about a 
dozen pieces of bread cut very thin about two inches long, 
and an inch wide, taking care that there is crust along 
one of their long sides, and you must dry these thoroughly 
in the oven. When it is time to send up the soup, you 
remove the superfluous fat from it, and set it to simmer 
for a quarter of an hour. Xow, prepare a liaison made as 
follows : — Break two eggs in a basin, beat them well as 



THICK SOUPS AND PUREES. 45 

for an omelette adding two ounces of butter, dip a coffee- 
cup into the soup, and mix tliat quantity with the egg and 
butter, adding another cupful when the butter is melted. 
Take the soup off the fire, pour it over the slices of bread, 
next add the liaison, and serve in three minutes. This 
should be enough for six basins. The eggs must be tho- 
roughly beaten, if not, pieces of the white will form in 
flakes in the boiling soup, and spoil its appearance. 

This leads me to an important point in most thick soups, 
and purees, and that is the addition of cream, or milk 
with the yolks of eggs. It will be found in some recipes 
for these soups that boiled cream is ordered to be added. 
The distinction is important : not merely is the risk of 
curdling avoided, but the flavour imparted to the potage 
is different. All know, for example, how different is the 
taste of coffee that is made with boiling milk, from that to 
which cold milk has been added. When therefore you 
add cream to soup, boil it beforehand separately. 

Milk is a substitute for cream especially if a yolk of an 
egg be added to it, but be careful in adding the yolk lest 
the soup be curdled. To do this, boil the milk first atten- 
tively, and pour it through a strainer into the soup ; next 
make the tureen hot, and just before serving, throw 
into it the yolk of the egg, and a little butter ; take a 
spoonful of the soup, and work it well with the yolk, 
then add more soup, spoonful by spoonful, mixing tho- 
roughly ; lastly, pour in the remainder of the soup which 
should, of course, be as hot as possible. 

Whether you add eggs, cream, or milk to soup, it is a 
sine quel non that the process be carried out off the fire, i.e., 
the vessel containing the soup must be lifted from the fire 
before you go to work. 

Thick soups may be divided into two classes — the white, 
and the brown. The principles followed in both are very 



46 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

similar ; the main difference, of course, consists in the sort 
of meat used, and the employment of roux, or liaison as 
the case may be. 

Boux is simply melted butter, with flour added to it, 
axjcording to the quantity of soup you want to thicken. 
The butter must he melted first, the flour being dredged in 
by degrees, and stirred vigorously at the bottom of the 
sauce-pan until thoroughly incorporated, and velvety. As 
soon as it turns hroivn, the roux is ready. This is what is 
wanted for brown soups. For a white, the liaison must 
nut be allo^Yed to take colour ; you must commence adding 
the soup to it as soon as the flour and butter have been 
sufficiently worked together. 

In making these soups, the utmost care should be taken 
not to over-do the thickening. In the case of a white 
soup, this error is almost more fatal than in that of a 
brown. You might as well offer your guest a basin of 
arro^^^•oot " conjee," or any nice gruel, for the savoury 
flavour of the soup is easily overpowered. A little prac- 
tice will teach a cook how much flour, is necessary to 
obtain the desired consistency of a thick soup, and he 
should bear in mind that the full effect of the thickening 
does not assert itself until the soujd, which has been added 
to it, comes to the boil. 

Observe that you add the soup to the roux, not the 
roux to the soup. The adding should be done by degrees, 
if you want the soup to be smooth and creamy. 

If, after coming to the boil, you find the soup too thin, 
you must proceed as follows : — mix a little more roux very 
carefully in a small sauce-pan, add a cupful of the soup to 
it, and when quite smooth, and free from lumps, pour it 
by degrees into the soup, off the fire, through a pointed 
gravy strainer, stirring vigorously as you do so. When 
quite mixed, replace the vessel on the fire, and let it boil up. 



THICK SOUPS AND PUREES. 47 

I have given several recipes for thick soups such as 
mock-turtle, ox-tail, giblet, &c,, in my menus, and if the 
few general rules I have laid down be carefully noted, I 
think that my readers will experience very little difficulty 
in carrying them out satisfactorily. 

And now, we come to the puree which, to my mind, is 
perhaps one of the most important features of the whole 
study of cookery. 

In India this form of preparing our meat and vegetables 
ought to be much more generally understood and practised 
than it is. In a puree we can work into a palatable and 
wholesome condition, meat that from its poverty or tough- 
ness, would be sorry fare indeed if boiled, or roasted. An 
ordinary little dish of neatly trimmed mutton-chops (nicely 
grilled over a clear &e) becomes an artistic entree if served 
round a nest of mashed potato, containing a delicate puree 
of vegetable, such as celery, peas, asparagus, tomato, 
spinach, &c., whilst common onion sauce, thus treated, is 
promoted to the dignity of sauce souhise. 

Old partridges and jungle fowl, the remains of cold 
poultry, and of all game, can be turned to capital account 
in a puree. Even an ancient, and extraordinarily tough 
" moorghee^' may be thus rendered fit to eat. For the sick, 
and for those suffering from tooth- ache, food cooked in 
this manner is invaluable, whilst there can be no doubt 
that it must be good for children. 

In order to be able to accomplish the making of purees 
satisfactorily you must possess a strong pestle and mortar, 
a large hair sieve, a wire sieve, and a mincing machine. 
If you desire to make a puree of meat of any kind, an 
immense amount of labour is saved by first using the 
mincer, the work in the mortar is then reduced to a mini- 
mum, and the pounded meat will soon be ready to pass 
through the sieve. 



48 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

In using the sieve, by the way, caution your cook that 
he must always put whatever he wishes to pass through 
it, at the shallow end., placing the sieve over a large bowl, 
or dish, big enough to receive it, and rubbing the puree 
through it with a large wooden spoon. From time to time 
he must invert the sieve, and scrape off the portion of the 
puree which always adheres to the reverse side of the hair, 
or wire. A cook must be patient in the use of this utensil, 
and achieve his object by perseverance, rather than by 
boisterous work. If you bear too heavily on the hair, 
your sieve will soon bulge, and ere long the hair will part 
company from the wooden cylinder to which it is attached. 

Purees., as soups, are prepared in this way : — You first 
must make as good a bowl of stock as you can from bones, 
meat, scraps, (bones of ham and bacon especially valuable) 
sufficient for the number of people you have to cater for. 
Let it get cool and remove the fat that rises to its surface. 
You should flavour your stock to the best of your capa- 
bilities with dried sweet herbs, onion, parsley, a carrot or 
two, celery, <tc., or such vegetables as may be available, 
with salt and pepper to taste. The better your stock, or 
foundation, the better jovoc puree. 

Suppose, now, that you want to make iiotage a la Crecij, 
which in plain terms is carrot puree : — boil as many carrots 
as you think will suffice for the quantity of soup you have 
to make in the stock made as aforesaid : when thoroughly 
done, drain them, and pass them through the sieve. Now, 
mix the pulp so obtained with sufficient of the stock to 
make a puree a little thinner than you wish your soup 
eventually to be. Melt a piece of butter at the bottom of 
a sauce-pan, and work a little flour into it, gradually 
adding th.Q puree, and stirring without ceasing till the soup 
comes to the boil, when it will bo found of the proper 
consistency. Skim, if necessary, and serve. 



THICK SOUPS, AND PUREES, 49 

The pith of this recipe, and of all receipts for purees, lies 
ill the liaison of melted butter and flour which must be 
worked into the soup as described, and at the period indi- 
cated. Why ? — well, have you ever noticed carrot, or 
pea-soup, which, when sent to table, instead of looking the 
creamy red, or green puree that you desired, presented the 
appearance of a thin gravy soup, with a quantity of the 
vegetable pulp at the bottom of each basin — the stock and 
the pulp not having amalgamated ? This result was 
caused by the omission of the process I have described 
which is necessary to blend the two together, 

Grecy soup should be served with bread cut into dice 
and fried in butter ; or crisped on a buttered tin in the oven 
after having been soaked in a little of the stock. Croutons, 
treated in this way, should accompany all vegetable 

purees. 

Purees of celery, Jerusalem artichokes, (Palestine soup,) 
onion, and turnips, if the stock be kept free from colour, 
can be served as white soups, and cream, or the substitute 
already described, will be found an improvement to all of 
them. 

"" Potage a la reine,^' a very old white soup, is really a 
puree of fowl or turkey, and an excellent white potage, 
very like it, can be produced from a rabbit. Those artistic 
entrees " creme de Jiomard,'' " creme de volaille,'' " crenie 
d'artichaicts,'' Sf'c, are merely consolidated purees. The 
quenelle again, is only meat worked to that condition, and 
bound with bread-crumb, or paste, and eggs. 

The puree of chestnuts is a well-known delicacy at 
elaborate banquets at home and abroad, whether in the 
form of soup, or as a sauce to accompany white entrees, 
and especially the turkey. The Indian nut commonly 
known as the " promotion nut," and fresh almonds, mako 
capital purees if carefully treated^ and I daresay that there 

5 



50 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

are other nuts to be got in India that wonld well repay the 
trouble of a trial, in the same way. 

All green vegetable purees derive enrichment in appear- 
ance by the judicious addition of " spinach-greening" which 
is, in itself, the liquor obtained from spinach boiled, di-ain- 
ed, worked through the sieve, and then squeezed through a 
piece of muslin. I have seen people quite deceived with a 
soup made with di-ied peas and coloiu^ed with " spinach- 
greening" in imitation of puree de pois verts. A pinch of 
sugar ought not to be forgotten in making these soups. 

The enterprising cultivators of asparagus at Madras 
ought now and then to indulge their guests with that 
excellent soup "puree d'asperges,'' which however ranks 
next, I take it, to the still more artistic "consomme aux 
points d'asperges.'' 

You can make a capital green puree any day at Madras 
with French beans ; and with one tin oi petits pois (thought- 
fully assisted with spinach-greening if the peas have lost 
colour) you can produce a very perfect puree of green 
peas for about eight people. A very inviting-looking soup 
of bright colour can be made from tomatoes, following 
exactly the receijDt for " Crecy," and substituting tomatoes 
for carrots. 

Brown purees are, of course, those made of game such 
as hares, partridges, snipe, wild duck, teal, etc. In this 
way you can always advantageously dispose of tough old 
birds. A good puree de gihier, of hare, or of any game- 
bird, is, TN-ithout doubt, soup which is with justice widely 
popular. It is essentially the soup of the hungry man. 
A basin of it, to use a homely phrase, " goes a long way." 
It carries your thoughts back to winter fires, to old-fashion- 
ed, yet generous fare, and to the glorious appetite with 
which you spread your napkin before you after a day with 
the hounds, a trudge after wild partridges, or a long drive 
through the keen frosty air of some by-gone Christmastide ! 



THICK SOUPS, AND PUREES. 51 

These soups are what house-keepers call " rich," for in 
their composition jou must employ port, or Madeira, red 
currant jelly, butter, cream, yolks of eggs, &c. One of 
the greatest cooks of the age propounds half a bottle of 
old port for his hare soup ! and all game soups take a 
goodly share of wine. 

The points to observe in the making of these purees are, 
first, to get every atom of flavour you can out of the bones, 
scraps, and giblets, which is done by simmering them 
watchfully in stock. Then to work all the meat you can 
pick from the birds to a stiff paste in a mortar (having 
first minced it in the machine) passing it through the 
sieve to get rid of fibre, gristle, and so forth. Next to 
blend the pulp of the game with the stock in the way I 
have previously described. And lastly, to follow with 
accuracy whatever recipe you have taken as regards the 
flavouring elements. Do not leave out anything if you 
can possibly manage it. Dried sweet herbs, (thyme and 
marjoram,) are as necessary in game soups, as is basil in 
turtle ; and red currant jelly is indispensable. Spice is 
often mentioned in recipes for these soups. I do not recom- 
mend it. In fact, beyond the two cloves inserted in the 
onion used for the stock, I would carefully omit it. 

As I intend to give detailed instructions for game purees 
in their turn in my menus, I will not pursue the subject 
any further in this chapter. Neither will I discuss the 
treatment of tinned soups just yet, for I shall reserve that 
branch of Indian soup-making for consideration hereafter 
in a chapter devoted to " Camp cookery." 

N.B. — Caution your butler to be careful to help the 
soup at a dinner party with judgment. One ladleful in 
each basin is ample.

Regarding our Fish. 

^ISH, under skilful hands, offers," says Brillat 
Savarin, " inexhaustible resources of gustatory 
enjoyment ; whether served up entire, in pieces, 
or sliced ; done in water, in oil, or in wine ; hot or cold ; 
in all cases it receives a hearty welcome." "We, who live 
at Madras, on a coast which yields a perennial supply of 
good fish, (to borrow a well-known figure of speech) should 
surely lay these words to heart. 

With a market as fairly well supplied as ours, we ought 
never to be at a loss for variety, or for scope to exercise 
our cook's ingenuity. The fair hostess should always be 
able to soothe herself with the reflection that with the 
fish, at all events, her guests will be well satisfied. Now, 
do we avail oarselves, as we ought to do, of the many 
opportunities we undoubtedly possess of turning Madras 
fish to a good account ? I certainly think not : indeed I 
fear that only a few of us appreciate the true value of this 
most excellent article of our daily food. 

At the ordinary Madras dinner party, you may rely 
almost for certain on having boiled seer fish, with a sauce, 
and a few slices of cucumber and beetroot, or a spoonful of 
salad ! on the side of your plate. Or the fish may be 
pomfret, similarly served. " Tartar e,'' " a parody of liollan- 
daise,'^ and melted butter with essence of anchovy, com- 



REGARDING OUR FISH. 53 

pose apparently the whole repertoire of sauces within the 
reach of the local clief. 

N.B. — I have never been able by the way to trace the 
origin of the Madras custom of serving a portion of salad 
with a thick eggy dressing on the same plate as the slice 
of Jwt fish. To put salad on a hot plate is to begin with 
an unpardonable offence, while the association of salad 
with hot fish is incongruous in the extreme. The same 
remark applies to the service of cold cucumber and beet- 
root with hot fish. Delicately stewed cucumber, hot, little 
orlys of oysters, ov petit s houchees of prawn or lobster, may 
accompany the fish, if you like ; otherwise it should be 
presented with its sauce alone. The proper time for serv- 
ing the salad is with " the roast,'' when it should be sent 
round on separate plates, and as cold as possible. 

I^ow, without wishing for one moment to question the 
sterling merits of plain-boiled fish, I confess that for a din- 
ner party I strongly advocate dishes of a more artistic 
nature. There are so many easy recipes for cooking fish 
nicely, that an effort to produce a little novelty in this 
feature of the menu can scarcely result in failure. In Eng- 
land where you have many varieties of fishes, and some of 
the best of them only to be seen in the market during their 
especial seasons, a little sameness in the style of cooking 
may not perhaps strike you. You may boil and fry plainly 
every day in the week, if each day you are able to present 
a different fish. Not so with us in Madras. Our supply 
is good enough, but it lacks diversity ; and it is on this 
account particularly that I am anxious to direct the atten- 
tion of my readers to a few easy ways of relieving the 
monotony which I have pointed out. 

It may be urged that your fish is brought home from 
market too late in the evening for the successful accom- 
plishment of studied effects, and perhaps your butler will 
take pains to thrust that fact before you. Regard such 



54 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

an excuse, please, as a mere evasion, for, in point of fact, 
fish takes so short a time to dress thoroughly, that an 
hour should suffice for the most elaborate recipe. I always 
bear in mind the iime that is necessary for the production 
of the dishes I select for my inenns. 

Again, many people hesitate to offer their guests a dish 
of dressed fish, fearing that it may be considered too rich. 
This is absui'd, for there are plain, as well as rich methods 
of varying this branch of cookery ; and, in composing your 
onemi, you should select one in harmony with the soup 
which precedes, and entree which is to follow it. Thus : 
if your soup be of a thick creamy kind, and your first 
entree (say) a vol-au-vent, let the fish be served in aspic 
iced, and with sauce ravigote or tartare. But if you give 
a clear consomme delicately flavoured, and order an iced 
entree to succeed the fish, you can indulge in a " matelote 
anx chamjngnons,'' or seer " d, la creme de crevettes." A 
thick soup, fish -wdtli lobster sauce, followed by an entree 
with cream in its composition, would form, for instance, 
a combination of good things obviously inartistic in design, 
and one which few could enjoy with impunity. As I 
observed in an early chapter of my " jottings," the charm 
of a dinner according to the new regime consists in the 
harmony of its lights and shadows. 

N.B. — If you follow the new style of menu, and present 
the relet e after the fish, you need have no apprehension. 
With regard to the service of dressed fish, especially if 
it be preceded by a clear soup. 

Fish, we all know, I hope, may be boiled, fried, baked, 
roasted, stewed, or grilled ; and by every method can 
tasty dishes be prepared. I will begin with the principles 
to be observed in boiling fish, and take the other styles of 
cookery in the order I have named. 

After having thoroughly cleansed, and wiped the fish, 



REGARDING OUR FISH. 55 

rub it over with a little vinegar, and place it on the 
drainer of the fish-kettle, so that when done it may be 
lifted out without risk of breaking up. Put plenty of salt, 
and a dessert-spoonful of vinegar, into the water in which 
the fish is to be boiled. Let the water be cold, and in 
sufficient quantity to cover the fish. Place the kettle on a 
brisk fire, and boil the fish as fast as possible. Skim off 
all scum that rises, and take care to suspend operations, 
the moment the fish is done. Overboiled fish is nasty to 
eat, and ngly to look upon : underdone fish is unfit for 
human food. The cookery books allow ten minutes per 
pound as a fair average of the time required for this 
operation; but so much depends upon the thickness of 
the fish to be boiled, that the cook should test it now and 
then with the point of a skewer, and as soon as the flesh 
parts easil y from the bone , let him decide that it is ready. 

N'ever let your fish, after it is done, remain soaking in 
the water in which it has been cooked ; drain it at once, 
or it will become what cooks call " woolly." If ready too 
soon, let it rest on the drainer over the hot kettle, and 
cover it with a napkin. 

If you have no fish-kettle, put your fish on a dish, tie a 
napkin round it, and boil it : when done, you can then lift 
the dish out of the pan without spoiling the appearance 
of the fish. Be very particular to drain e very drop of 
w ater from the_ fishJbefore you serve it, or the sauce you 
send up with it will be ruined. 

Connoisseurs in the art of cookery recommend that fish 
should be boiled in a " Court bouillon,^' in which case the 
process is thus described by the Gr. C. : " Having placed 
the fish in the fish-kettle with enough cold-water to cover 
it, add a glass of vinegar, some slices of carrots and onions, 
and a clove of garlic ; then sweet herbs, and spices tied up 
in a muslin bag, with pepper, salt, and parsley or celery. 



56 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

The proportions of all these must depend upon the quan- 
tity of fish to be boiled, the skill of the cook, and the taste 
of the company." When nearly done, half di'aw the fish- 
kettle from the fire, and let the fish si mmer gently till the 
moment of serving. A mixtui^e of white wine such as 
chablis, sauterne, or hock, and water, in equal parts, may 
be used instead of the vinegar and water. 

Fish cooked '* an bleu'' is also considered a delicacy. 
The preparation is exactly like court ho2(,illo7i, red wine 
being substituted for white. 

Court hoidllon a la Nanfaise is made of milk and water 
in equal parts, salt, and pepper in proportion. 

The art of frying fish consists in being prodigal in the use 
of the medium which you employed to cook with. The fish 
should be absolutely immersed in a bath of boiling fat or oil, 
which should be carefully tested so that you may be convinc- 
ed of its temperature. " If your fat be not sufficiently 
heated," says the authority I have already quoted, " the 
fish you want to fry will turn out a flabby and greasy mess, 
instead of a crisp, appetising dish." For nearly all fish- 
frying, the frying basket is an invaluable utensil, used, of 
course, in conjunction with the deep-sided friture-ipB.ii. 

Fish, fried in the English fashion, is generally egged 
and bread-crumbed. The Italians, who are perhaps the 
best ' frysters' in the world, either flour their fish, or dip 
it in batter. Both methods are, to my mind, vastly supe- 
rior to the bread-crumbing process. If, however, you must 
use crumbs, see that they are stale, and well sifted ; not 
the pithy lumps, both great and small, too often set before 
you, because Ramasamy will not look ahead, and rarely, if 
ever keeps a bottled supply of stale, well rasped bread in 
hand. 

To obtain a satisfactory result, proceed as follows : — 
Having crumbled some stale bread as small as you can in 



REGARDING OUR FISH. 57 

a napkin, pass the crumbs througli a stiff wire sieve ; then 
place the plate containing them into the oven to dry 
thoroughly. To apply them properly, beat up two eggs 
with a dessert-spoonful of salad oil, and the same of water. 
This mixture should be brushed over the fish like varnish, 
and the fish should then be turned over in a napkin, con- 
taining the dry crumbs. 

For flouring : — dip the fish in milk, and then turn it 
over in a napkin containing some flour. A recipe for fry- 
ing batter will be found in the chapter reserved for the 
discussion of that process of cookery. 

Under the head of baking we come to that very excellent 
method of treating fish which is familiar to most of you as 
" au gratin." The cook can, in this way, produce very 
pleasant results, with very little toil. You can commence 
as plainly as possible, and go on to the most elaborate and 
fanciful dishes, the principles in all being similar. The 
fish, to begin with, should either be whole, in fillets, or 
slices. The pie-dish should be well buttered ; tomatoes, 
maccaroni, mushrooms, trufiles of course, finely-minced 
parsley, shallot, lime peel, and such, fines Jierhes as you can 
command, should be used for the more elaborate composi- 
tions ; whilst parsley, shallot, and butter alone with fine 
bread-crumbs will suffice for the plainer dish for ordinary 
occasions. A gravy made from the bones and trimmings, 
with a few pepper corns, a minced shallot and a glass of 
any light white wine, like chablis, hock, or sauterne, may 
be gently poured round your dish when it is packed ready 
for the oven : but the liquid ought never to come up to 
the level, quite, of the top layer of the fish in the pie-dish, 

- In connection with maccaroni and tomatoes, you should 
try a dusting of grated parmesan. 

Rolled anchovies, and prawns, form, with truffles and 
mushrooms, the most appropriate garnish for an artistic 



58 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

" au gratin" and cream is often judiciously introduced to 
enrich tlie combination. 

Fishes carefully stuffed, and baked Tvhole, are generally 
nice : it is a method very well suited to fresh water fish, 
and a delicious way of cooking a Madi'as mullet, or a dish 
of whitings. 

The best dish of stewed fish is the " matelote' which, 
strictly speaking, should be composed of eels, but may, I 
think, be equally well followed in dressing any firm-fleshed 
fish. As I shall speak of this dish in my menus, I need 
only say en passant that it is rich, vinous, spicy, and con- 
sequently generally appreciated by the muscular Christian. 

Broiling fish sounds simple, but under this head there 
are a few toothsome recipes not to be despised. Let a 
good cut of seer be divided into nice cutlets. Parboil 
them in the morning, and set them to marinade all day in 
salad oil, minced shallot, parsley, vinegar, a clove of garlic, 
a few whole pepper corns, and a little lime peel. Take 
them out, wrap them with the shallot, &c., in well-oiled 
papers, broil over a fast clear fire, and serve with a nice 
sharp brown sauce like sauce Robert. Take care that the 
bars of your grid-iron are well oiled, for they are apt to 
burn delicate morsels like fillets of fish en papillotes. 

Fish of fairly good size can be roasted " a la hroclie^ 
The method is recommended for mullet, murrel, and all 
fish whose shape adapts itself, as it were, to the spit. 
Stuff the fish, wrap it in oiled paper, tie it to the spit, and 
baste continually with melted butter and white wine. 
Remove the paper before serving. 

The Bouillabaisse may be attempted at Madras with a 
result sufiiciently satisfactory to warrant my being bold 
enough to record a simple recipe for it, adapted from that 
of the " G. C." as follows :— 



REGARDING OUR FISH. 59 

Take any sort of small fish, sucli as small pomfret, 
whitings, soles, mullets, or robal, — the greater the variety 
the better, — and for two pounds of mixed fish, slice up two 
Bombay onions, two fairly large tomatoes emptied of their 
seeds and cut into quarters, and one carrot ; prepare a 
couple of slices of lime with the pithy skin cut off, a bag 
containing six cloves, a dozen pepper corns, a clove of 
garlic, and the peel of a lime pared as finely as possible ; a 
salt-spoonful of saffron, a tea-spoonful of salt, and one pod 
of capsicum sliced, will also be wanted : put the whole into 
a stew-pan, and add to it a wine-glass of salad oil, one of 
chablis, and a pint and a half of cold water, boil for about 
half an hour, and, just before serving, add a heaped up 
table-spoonful of freshly-chopped curled parsley. The 
parsley is absolutely indispensable. Serve the fish, in a 
deep dish, with some of the broth round it, sending up the 
rest of the broth first, poured boiling hot over some slices 
of stale bread. Remove the bag of condiments, of course, 
before serving the houillahaisse. The dish will not be as 
good, to be sure, as that which some of my readers may 
have enjoyed in the south of France, but if the ingi^edients 
I have named be used without any omissions, a very fair 
imitation will certainly be produced. 

Having thus sketched the various ways of preparing fish 
for the table, I must request my readers to note the 
recipes I have given in my detailed menus, remembering 
that my object has been to suggest dishes, which, in my 
humble opinion, will be found more pleasing than the 
ordinary plainly boiled lumps of fish, which, with the 
stereotyped concomitants, I have so strenuously condemned 
too often greet the diner out in Madras.

Hints about Entrees. 



9^t^>^ 



(j^^TlT^E persons out of every ten with whom I con- 
Ji-\y\ verse on culinary matters seem to be more exer- 
cised in their minds regarding their entrees than 
about the whole of the arrangements of their dinner put 
together. The really presentable side-dishes that the 
average Ramasamy can master may, as a rule, l)e counted, 
I am told, upon the fingers of one hand : and these are 
generally so well known that a lady is oft times at her 
wit's end to compose her meyiu. So precious, indeed, has 
the knowledge of a new entree become, that the happy 
mistress of a novelty might be fairly excused were she to 
refuse to divulge the secret to her dearest friend. It must 
be a humiliating sensation, I admit, after having eaten 
oyster patties with your friend on Monday, to be forced 
to bid him partake of the same dish with you on Thurs- 
day ; conscious perhaps, that the pastry at your house is 
not a whit better than that which you thought so indiffer- 
ent at his. The oyster patty, by the way, is one of Rama- 
samy 's few art studies. 

Now, I cannot but alloAv that the apprehension with 
which this part of the bill-of-fare is so generally regarded, 
is well-founded and natural. There are, of course, entrees 
and entrees. Though a few may be easy, some are beyond 
our reach in this country owing to a variety of reasons, 



HINTS ABOUT ENTREES. 61 

and many, owing to the ambiguous wording of cookery 
book receipts, seem equally inaccessible. Then the task 
of ordering dishes from works composed for people with 
English cooks, kitchen ranges, and the best market in the 
world at their disposal, is far from easy. Even those who 
fancy themselves to be pretty good cooks find, every now 
and then, in the pages of their pet author, knotty points 
which require much consideration to settle. But if you 
will patiently follow me, not rushing to the conclusion 
that I only write for the benefit of a few enthusiasts like 
myself, I firmly believe that I shall be able to smooth 
down much that appears rugged ; and help you towards 
the selection and accomplishment of many tasty dishes, 
which, if neither elaborate, nor very scientific, will still be 
found practicable, and generally worthy of a second trial. 

First, let us divide entrees into three distinct classes : — 
the plain, the half -rich, and the fanciful. 

In the first class I would place such dishes as the 
mutton cutlet (neck chop) grilled, fried, or stewed ; the 
epigramme ; fillets of meat, turkey, fowl, rabbit, or pigeon ; 
grenadins ; entrees of meat, that is to say, plainly cooked, 
accompanied by carefully devised sauces, or really good 
purees of vegetable. 

For class the second, I would reserve all compositions 
of meat requiring the mincing machine and the mortar, — ■ 
delicate combinations which demand attentive flavouring — ■ 
such as cassolettes, croquettes, croustades, quenelles, boudms, 
timbales, rissolettes and mixed ingredients en caisses. 

Whilst in the superlative class should be entered, I 
think, the supreme, the vol-au-vent, the hramoushy, the 
studied ragout, the artistic salmis, and any entree out of 
class the second when raised from its ordinary form to a 
higher level by treatment a la financiere, a la ReinCj d la 
Perigueux, and so on.

62 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

Quite in a special parenthesis by themselves onght to 
be kept all plats which can be served cold, such as the 
chaud-froid, chartreuse, petits galantines, truffled cutlets, 
(fee, for in a climate such as this an iced entree cannot fail 
to attract attention, whilst for providing contrast, and 
other reasons, I shall speak of presently, it is invaluable. 

Having thus arranged the various dishes which come 
"Binder the head of entrees in a systematic form, the task of 
selection therefrom must be governed by the sort of 
dinner you intend to give, the different items that compose 
your menu, and the capabilities of your cook. As a rule, 
you should generally, for the sake of contrast, select one 
dish from class one, and the other from either class two, 
or three ; or an iced entree followed by one from either 
of the two richer classes. 

I have already advised you never to attempt to give 
more than two entrees, and I repeat the advice now, be 
your dinner a banquet for forty covers, or a party of eight 
friends. The menu of the best mess dinner I ever attend- 
ed in India (given to a late Governor of Madras whose 
taste in culinary matters was proverbial) contained but 
one iced, and one elaborate entree. These were, of course, 
served separately, and to provide against delay, there 
were (for forty guests) four dishes formed of each compo- 
sition. 

In ordering your entrees, you should carefully consider 
the amount of work your cook will have upon his hands at 
the critical time of serving them, and bear in mind that the 
more he has to do then, the more likely will he be to make 
mistakes. Is it not unfair to expect your cook to serve 
ewqually well two hot entrees demanding attentive manipula- 
tion up to the last moment ? Select, therefore, for one of 
jour side-dishes something that can be prepared before- 
hand, and be easily heated when required, so that your 



HINTS ABOUT ENTREES. 63 

chefs attention need not be distracted from tlie other. On 
these grounds the iced entree is a grand invention. It can 
be made early in the day, and then set in the ice-box, 
ready to follow the fish or releve, as the case may be, with- 
out delay, and the sauce can also be similarly treated. 
Dishes that merely require heating in the oven are a god- 
send to a cook, for he can compose them at his leisure 
during the afternoon, and put them aside till within a few 
minutes of the time when they are wanted, keeping their 
sauces nice and hot in the bain-marie pan. But the un- 
happy man who has (say) to turn out a delicately grilled 
dish of cutlets a la Maintenon, with Jcramoushys aux JiuUres 
to follow — independently of game, joint, sweets, &c., all 
needing a watchful eye — is surely to be pitied. 

There is another point to watch when choosing your 
entrees, and that is their general relationship with each 
other, or with the other dishes that compose your menu. 
Artists in ordering dinners go as far as to say that nothing 
should be repeated. You must not give, for instance, a 
consomme de volaille, and presently follow it with croquettes 
de volaille, or even fowl as a rot. Mutton appearing in a 
side-dish must not be seen again in any form. Two white 
meats ought not to be introduced side by side. Though 
following this maxim to the best of our power, we cannot 
always rely on being able to carry it out thoroughly in 
Madras. The market supply is alas ! too meagTC, as a 
rule, for us to pick and choose as we might wish. 

To return to our class list of entrees, I cannot too strongly 
urge you to go in for dishes from class one more than 
you do. Can anything be more acceptable than a nice 
juicy little chop from a necJc of mutton, on whose sides 
the marks of the grid-iron are plainly visible, reposing 
against a circle of really well-mashed potatoes, or of 
savoury rice, holding in its centre a puree of celery, petits 
pois, or sauce souhise ? The grid-iron is invaluable : the 



64 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

chop comes to table full of gravy, yet not underdone ; it 
has, to use a kitchen phrase, " seen the fire" (browned) in 
places, and is absolutely free from the grease which so 
often mars a dish of chops cooked in the frying pan. For 
the little Club-dinner, this class of entree is always popular. 
I noticed that a plain cutlet such as I have described, or a 
plain fillet of beef, figured in almost every Club menu, I 
had the pleasure of discussing when last at home. Plea- 
sing variety can be secured by the cook if he will change 
his sauce, or his puree. Choose the nech chops for these 
entrees. 

The fillet of mutton is that tender strip of meat which 
runs down the inside of the saddle under the kidney. If 
of sufficient thickness, this delicate morsel, cut into nice 
pieces, and broiled over a clear fire, is worthy of Lucullus 
himself. It is the thing for an invalid, or one coming 
round after an illness. 

The fillet of beef is the undercut of the sirloin, which 
the butcher will cut out for you in the market here if you 
wish it. But I have found good fillets produced thus : — 
Buy a really good joint of the ribs of beef, and cut out 
lengthways the good tender meat near the end of the 
bone, with any fat there may be attached to it. Bones, 
and flap, and trimmings can be counted in the allowance 
of gravy-meat, and the tender meat you have cut out will 
trim into capital fillets /or entrees, or cook whole as du filet 
de boeuf pique, aux champignons, au puree d'oseille, S^c, as a 
relet' e. 

Fillets of fowls and game are formed by cutting oft' 
neatly the whole of the breast meat right down to the 
wing joint ; this you can divide into fillets according to the 
size you requii'e. 

The hare and rabbit fillet is produced by cutting out 
the long strip of good meat which runs down either side 



HINTS ABOUT ENTREES. 65 

of the back bone. Well larded with fat bacon, and 
cooked grenadin-ioo^hion, with Espagnole, or sauce souhise, 
you may do worse than present a dish of these fillets to 
your best friend. 

Whether your entree be a fillet of beef or mutton, of 
fowl or of game, or the neatly trimmed neck chop to 
which I have alluded ; and whether yon intend to grill, to 
stew, or to fry it, you will find it vastly improved by 
being set en marinade from early morning until the time 
draws near for cooking it. I shall use this word frequently 
in my menus, let me therefore explain its meaning as 
applied to the process which I now take the opportunity 
of noticing. 

The word marinade, as you all know, really means 
pickle, but viewed in the light in which we now regard it, 
it would be better to describe it as a mixture, the com- 
ponent parts of which can be varied at pleasure, in which 
meat should be soaked for several hours before it is cooked. 
Its immediate effect is to preserve the outside of the meat 
which has " felt the knife" moist and juicy, to prevent its 
" turning," and to lend that subtle flavour to it — so hard 
to describe — but which just makes the difference between 
our ordinary cutlet, and that which we remember having 
eaten at some restaurant abroad, or at the table of a friend 
who possessed a really well educated cook. 

The common form of marinade for beef and mutton is 
composed of salad oil and vinegar in the proportion of four 
of the former to one of the latter, with one large Bombay 
onion sliced, one clove of garlic chopped up, twelve whole 
peppers, six cloves, a tea-spoonful of salt, a couple of tea- 
spoonfuls of dried thyme or marjoram, a table-spoonful of 
minced parsley, and a strip or two of very finely pared 
lime peel. This mixture can be preserved for daily use, 
with slight additions from time to time, and the flavour 



66 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

can be modified by changing the sweet herbs, or with- 
drawing them. 

The taste of game can be imparted to cold, cooked 
mutton by placing the meat in a marinade composed of a 
wine-glass each of vinegar, portwine, and mushroom 
ketchup in which a table-spoonful of red currant jelly has 
been dissolved ; with a tea-spoonful of " spiced pepper," 
some pepper corns, salt, a chopped onion, and a dessert- 
spoonful of marjoram and thyme blended. A hash of cold 
mutton collops that have lain a few hours in this prepara- 
tion is very like that of venison, and the fillets of an 
Indian hare, (a little underdone in the roasting) similarly 
steeped all day, are really excellent. In this particular 
instance you must strain the marinade, and add it to the 
thick gravy in which the hash or fillets have to be 
simmered. 

Marinade need not be made in extravagant quantities. 
It should cover the bottom of the dish on which you place 
the meat, your object being gained by occasional turning, 
and basting. When wanted, the cook should lift the meat 
from the dish, let it drain a minute or so, and then pro- 
ceed to business. 

Independently of the method in which you purpose to 
cook them, a gi^eat deal depends upon the careful trimming 
of a dish of mutton cutlets. How uninviting do these 
miniature chops look when they have been cut anyhow 
from the joint to which they belonged ? First, saw off 
the ends of the row of bones level, and cut off the outer 
flap ; now take a very sharp knife, and divide the row of 
cutlets down to the bone with one clean decided cut between 
each of them, and, lastly, sever them with a single stroke 
of the chopper. Now, lay them on your board, and give 
them a few strokes with your cutlet bat, trim them into 
shape, and then place them in the marinade. The hungry 



HINTS ABOUT ENTREES. 67 

man may be able, no doubt, to eat the cutlets his cook may 
send him, " rough hew them as he may," but for an entree^ 
we must study appearance. 

Little paper frills placed round the ends of the bones of 
the cutlets before serving, give a finish to your entree. 

A cutlet to be grilled should be dipped at once in a little 
melted butter, or salad oil, and broiled over a clear fire. 
If to be stewed, it should be first browned by being turned 
frequently in a satt^^e-pan with a little melted butter ; the 
previously prepared gravy and vegetables should then be 
put into the stew-pan, in which the cutlet should simmer 
gently till done. The whole success of a stew depends 
upon simmering. If the cook carelessly allow the gravy 
in the pan to come to the boil, the cutlets (or anything 
else) will be done for. 

How often are hashes, and rechauffes of cold meat sent 
to table as hard and tasteless as leather, simply becaus e 
the cook permitted them to boil ? Hashes and salmis of 
cold meat and game may be defined, properly speaking, 
as carefully composed sauces in which meat is placed 
cold, and then gradually heated until sufficiently hot to 
serve. My own rule with a salmis is to take it off the fire 
as soon as the steam rises freely from the_ surface, to turn 
it immediately into a silver dish heated with scalding 
water, and send it up. 

Hashes and salmis are much improved if the cold meat 
composing them be soaked in the sauce for some time 
before cooking. 

The process of bread-crumbing a cutlet deserves far more 
care than a great majority of cooks bestow upon it. To do 
this really nicely (for an entree), you should proceed in this 
way. Lift your cutlet from the marinade, drain it a 
moment, then dip it into the following composition : — two 
eggs, one dessert-spoonful of salad oil, and one dessert- 



68 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

spoonful of water, well beaten together. Then tnrn it 
over and over in a plateful of fine, stale bread-crumbs 
which have been dried in the oven, pounded, and thoroughly 
sifted. It should then be laid aside for half an hour, after 
which it should be dipped again, and again rolled in 
crumbs. Amongst the crumbs may be sprinkled some 
finely-minced parsley and shallot, with s^ovae poicdered dried 
sweet herbs, and grated cheese is sometimes added with 
marked effect. The frying should be conducted in abund- 
ance of boiling fat, and the colour of the cutlets should be 
a pale golden brown. 

All thrifty cooks should carefully save the scraps of 
trimmings, the outer flap, and the ends of bone, which 
were cut off in shaping the cutlets, for from them the basis 
of the sauce which is to accompany the dish can, with u 
little assistance, be composed. 

Veal is occasionally procurable at Madras. If you suc- 
ceed in getting a nice dish of cutlets, remember that it is 
downright necessary to lard them with strips of fat bacon. 
Veal is apt to be dry in England where the calf is fattened 
for the market. In India it is far drier, and if cooked 
without the assistance of bacon, veal cutlets are positively 
wooden. 

N.B. — Let the sauce prepared for your entree of cutlets 
be sent round, piping hot, in a, boat. If poured round the 
cutlets, it makes them sodden, and loses its effect entirely.

Entrees— concluded. 



jTrt TAYING discussed the general methods of cooking 
(il'JL cutlets, and fillets, we ought next to consider a few 
good sauces to accompany them, but as I have 
resolved to devote a chapter to that branch of the cook's 
art, I must ask you to follow me now in a brief resume of 
wrinkles regarding the higher classes of entrees. 

Under class the second we come to that very useful 
style of entree which I have called the " half -rich." For 
these " made-dishes" you begin to call to youi' aid the 
mincing machine and mortar, and, unless your experience 
be above the average, success will almost wholly depend 
upon your following with accuracy every line of the recipe 
you may select. A well-flavoured cassolette, croquette, 
houdin, or quenelle, if nicely cooked, and served with a good 
sauce, a puree, or a macSdoine de legumes, is worthy of 
a place in any menu ; but the slightest slovenly work is 
fatal. 

Our good friend Ramasamy has been taught to believe 
that cutlets must be composed of chopped meats, so he 
often sends to table under that title a dish of croquettes, 
with a fragment of bone inserted in each of them. I need 
hardly remind my readers, for instance, of the dish of 
" chicken cutlets" which forms the standing plat of the 



70 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

Madras Hotel. I know that some cookery books describe 
as cotelettes, certain artistic mixtures of meats, with bits 
of bone introduced to make them look like true cutlets, 
but I would prefer omitting the bones, and calling such 
dishes by theii- proper names, for they undoubtedly belong 
really to the tribe of croquettes, houdins, ^c. 

Chicken, ox and sheep's tongues, tender mutton, ham, 
bacon, oysters, pigeons, turkey, rabbit, the livers of all 
poultry, of rabbits, and game, — whether previously cooked 
or not, — provide materials out of which these entrees can 
be made. It is in the judicious blending of two or more 
of them together, in the thorough pounding and incorpo- 
ration thereof, in the selection of the condiments he em- 
ploys to improve them, and so on, that the skill of the 
good cook can be detected. 

If you preserve your own ox tongues in this country, 
and keep one generally ready for use, you will have a 
very valuable thing to fall back upon for " made" entrees. 
Cured sheep's tongues, too, are very useful, and a little 
lamVs liver is sometimes a good thing to have at hand in 
case of need. 

Calves' liver cut into dice, and fried with some shallot 
in the pan in which some fat bacon has been melted, then 
set to get cold, and pounded in the mortar with some cold 
veal,* forms the well-known minced meat which surrounds 
a. pate defoie grr as and all French pates. The frying-pan 
should be rubbed with garlic before operations are com- 
menced, and the minced onion must go in with the liver. 
If you add to the mixture when pounded the minced trim- 
mings of any truffles you may have been using, the flavour 
will be exactly that of the pate. A little jar of this com- 
position, made at home, will be found well worth the 

* Use the white breast-meat of a cold roast chicken if you cannot 
get veal iu this country. The melted bacon must be pounded with 
the liver. — W. 



ENTREES— CONCLUDED. 71 

trouble it costs to make, when you are preparing (say) a 
dish of croqiiettes de volaille and want to improve the 
flavour of them. 

The hints I have already given regarding the bread- 
crumbing of mutton cutlets, hold good with reference to 
the crumbing of croquettes. If possible, indeed, you should 
be more particular in preparing your crumbs. Bread 
crisped in the oven and then pounded in the mortar pro- 
duces the chapelure used by French cooks. 

The sauces that should accompany this kind of entree 
require the utmost study, and will be treated of here- 
after. 

Rissoles, and rissolettes are very tasty if well done, and 
served hot. They may be described as a savoury salpicon, 
or mince, divided into small portions, each of which should 
be enclosed in little wrappers of delicate pastry : these, 
pinched closely all round, should be fried a golden yellow 
in abundance of boiling fat. They are then served dry on 
a napkin, garnished with crisply fried curled parsley. 

Cassolettes are little drums of potato or rice, hollowed 
out, filled with a delicate mince, and capped with either 
a cover made of the same substance as the case, or with a 
curl of crisply fried bacon, a turned olive, or a slice of 
truffle. 

Boudins are preparations of pounded meats steamed, and 
quenelles somewhat similar in composition but poached. 

Recipes will be found for each of these methods of 
cookery in the menus. 

Touching the highest class of entrees, it is impossible to 
say very much in the way of advice. You must submit to 
a little more expense than you did in classes one and two. 
Butter, cream, truffles, mushrooms, special gravy meat, 
Ac, must not be shirked, but be given to the cook with a 



72 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

liberal hand. As your Gouffe bids you, so must you 
proceed without a murmur. 

We do our utmost to give our guests, here in sultry 
Madras, a vol-au-vent, when we should know quite well 
that it is almost impossible to produce, in a temperature 
that rarely falls below 80 ° , the exquisitely light puff pastry 
from which the dish derives its name. The best attempts 
present the appearance of layers of talc laid one over the 
other in an oval-shape and baked a pale brown. Now, I 
maintain that it would be better to give up our fruitless 
efforts, and employ one of the ornamental earthenware 
dishes made specially for this purpose, and to be had of 
all good dealers in glass and crockery in London. Small 
ones for dishes en caisses are also sold. We could then 
send up oui' ragout a la financier e, or a la reine, without 
misgivings, in a pretty dish becomingly garnished, and 
bury the unhappy memories of the light puff paste we 
never could achieve. 

But whilst thus proposing to abandon as fruitless our 
attempts to place before our guests a true vol-au-vent, — 
conquered by the climate in which we live, and not through 
carelessness or want of culinary skill, — I, by no means, wish 
to say that we should cease to bestow our attention upon 
entrees which can be made of pastry of a less volatile nature. 
There are some Madras cooks, I know, who can turn out 
very good light pate pastry. To such men you can entrust, 
of course, petits pates, timhales, salpicon honchees, and those 
artistic croustades for which pastry is employed instead of 
the easier substitute of hollowed-out rolls. The knack of 
making nice light pastry is, however, far from common. 
Neither reading, nor even practical demonstration, will 
teach it. So unless you are certain that your cook 
possesses the gift, never permit him to waste good mate- 
rials in idle experiments. An entree of pastry, if not 
unmistakably good, is a blot upon the face of your menti. 



ENTREES- CONCL UDED. 73 

In nearly all recipes for tlie sauces of high class entrees 
contained in good works upon cookery, the use of butter is 
unsparingly advocated, and cream is also very frequently 
prescribed. In an early chapter of my jottings, I men- 
tioned that I would far sooner recommend a little extra 
expense with regard to these items, than in the wholesale 
distribution of " Europe stores." I repeat the opinion 
emphatically now. The dinner cooked with an adequate 
allowance of cream and butter, requires but little aid from 
Messrs. Crosse and Blackwell. Unfortunately, however, 
for those who desii^e to follow this precept at Madras, our 
supply of milk is meagre in quality and quantity, and 
absui'dly expensive. 

The only way to obtain a little butter fit to eat, if you 
do not maintain a dairy of your own, is to have a cow 
milked at your door, and to set the milk so obtained for 
cream in your own larder. I have never tried to find out 
the exact cost of a pound of butter thus made, but, ap- 
proximately speaking, it may be stated that five measures 
of milk at one rupee (the current rate) will not yield more 
than a good tliird of a pound, so your pound of butter will 
cost you neai'ly three rupees !* There will be a slight 
difference if the milk be rich ; in my estimate, I speak, of 
course, of the average country cow's milk purchased at the 
door. 

There is a terrible preparation which milkmen sell to our 
cooks under the title of " kitchen butter." To add to its 
attractiveness, it is generally smeared upon a leaf, and 
carried in the hand ! It looks like the compound used for 
greasing the wheels of railway carriages in England, which 
a porter once told a friend of mine was " mostly made of 
ingredunts, and stuff as ive makes up a^purpose." I fear 

* Milk has become a little cheaper since this was written, but the 
difficulty regarding butter and cream seems in no way removed. — W.

74 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

that oiir so-called " kitclien butter" migHt be equally 
vaguely described. 

What, then, can people of moderate incomes do ? For, 
I take it that even wealthy folk at home would hesitate to 
pay six shillings a pound for the butter used by their cooks ! 
The most economical remedy for this evil is to use preserved 
butter. The "Copenhagen" (cow brand), " Normandy," 
and " Denmark," at one rupee fourteen annas a pound-tin, 
are especially free from brine, or taint of any kind, and 
can be thoroughly recommended. One tin, carefully used, 
ought to suffice for the cooking of a dinner for eight per- 
sons, (assuming even that the meniL contain a full amount 
of dishes requiring butter in their composition) and, in my 
humble opinion, the result will generally be found to 
justify that amount of extravagance. 

Before I pass from the consideration of side-dishes to 
that of the sauces that should accompany them, I feel it 
incumbent upon me to repeat that vegetables ought never to 
he handed round U'ith the entrees. This quaint practice of 
our fore-fathers has been long since abandoned by those 
who give dinners of the reformed type. 

The modem entree is, of course, presumed to be ?i plat 
complete in itself, and perfectly independent of other as- 
sistance. When stated in the menu, a vegetable may, of 
course, accompany, an entree but it should be deftly associat- 
ed with the composition it accompanies, and be moulded in 
the same dish. A great many entrees require no vegetables. 
Who, for instance, could possibly eat potato and cauliflower, 
with a hramousky, or with a petit pate a la financiere ? 
The crisp batter in the former, and the pastry in the latter 
case, supply the necessary accompaniment of the delicate 
composition each contains. 

Apart from its being palpably inartistic, there are other 
reasons which prompt the abolition of sending round vege- 



ENTREES— CONCL UDED. 75 

tables with entrees. I refer to the time that is wasted in 
doing so, and the complication it adds to the service. 
Whilst the matter-of-fact objection to the practice is, that 
by the time they are really wanted for the joint, vegetables 
that have been hawked about with the entrees are cer- 
tainly mangled and cold, if not wholly expended ; for few 
people prepare relays of potatoes, &c.j to follow those sent 
up with their side-dishes. 

Lastly, let me say a few words about the garnishing 
and helping of entrees. 

As a general rule, our native cooks, assisted I dare say 
by the butler, are much given to the ornamentation of 
their side-dishes. Now, whilst fully prepared to pander 
as much as possible to the " lust of the eye," I warn you 
to be careful lest these efforts to make things look pretty 
be overdone. Slices of raw cucumber should be severely 
interdicted, for they impart an inky flavour to the entree 
round which they may be trimmed; and funny devices 
cut out of vegetables, and dotted about a dish, should be 
forbidden, for they suggest to the hypercritical mind an 
idea that perhaps fingers have been busily employed in 
arranging them. 

Pray do not permit your cook to garnish a croquette 
with a raw spring onion, — the green stem stripped and 
curled, and the bulb thrust into the croquette. I have 
actually seen this done, and once upon a time barely 
escaped eating tlie onion., which would have been a sad 
catastrophe, seeing that I had a most agreeable companion 
by my side. Let the arrangement of your entrees err on 
the side of simplicity rather than otherwise. 

To look effective, entrees should be arranged well above 
the level of silver dish upon which they are served. To 
attain this end, the French c/ie/ prepares a socle or founda- 
tion which he makes out of a solid block of bread, or 



76 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

ground-rice moulded : socles for cold entrees are even some- 
times made of melted wax candle consolidated with bees' 
wax. A flat socle for ordinary hot entrees is easily made 
with rice, which should be boiled, pounded, and then 
moulded with a wooden spoon into an oval or round block 
according to the shape of the dish. When moulded, it 
should be bmshed over with Q^g and colored in the oven. 
For cold entrees, spread the block over with fresh buttei-. 
Having thus obtained a firm foundation, the entree itself 
becomes, as it were, a superstructure erected upon the 
socle. Nothing looks more slovenly than an entree arranged 
on the level of the dish itself. 

Dishes that require careful helping ought certainly 
never to be handed round at a dinner party. I have 
observed that ladies frequently refuse an entree on account 
of the difficulty of helping themselves. A fair patroness 
of mine whose menage is worthy of her artistic skill, tells 
me that she has made up her mind (and rightly, say I,) 
never to permit her admirable mayonnaise d, la Gouffe to be 
handed round to her guests again. One person, she says, 
would take a little of the aspic, the next some of the salad, 
the third — engaged, perhaps, in pleasant chatter, with a 
pair of bright eyes full upon him — might absently secure 
a fragment of the garnish ! and so on, all in heart-rending 
ignorance of the science and care bestowed upon the dish. 

In any circumstances I strongly recommend that all 
iced entrees be helped from the side table, with a portion 
of the sauce upon each plate, and passed round to your 
guests without delay. For, in a climate as warm as this, 
speedy helping at the side table will prevent the possible 
contingency of liquefaction. Indeed all entrees might be 
thus served with manifest advantage. The menu card in 
front of yon tells you what is coming, and in this way you 
would be spared, at all events, the unpleasantness of having

a hot silver dish with its savoury contents thrust in between 
you and the lady you have taken in to dinner ; conversation 
would never be annoyingly interrupted ; pretty costumes 
and dress coats would be less liable to be baptized with hot 
gravy, whilst much valuable time would be saved= 




oxacA-T^TEi^ :r^. 



Sauces. 

fHE consideration of sauces may certainly be rcGfarded 
as the most interesting part of the study of cookery. 
So much, indeed, is to be gained by this branch of 
the art, that I might almost call it the most important. 
Whether for fish, for flesh, or fowl, the assistance thus con- 
tributed is invaluable. "Without penetrating very deeply 
into the mazes of elaborate cookery, if you once master tho 
broad principles of sauce-making, you need never be at a 
loss for variety in your dishes ; you will be able to improve 
good meat, and make that which is indifferent palatable ; 
whilst with cold things you will rarely fail to turn out little 
rechauffes which will be at once tasty, and economical. 

Now, I do not consider it a difficult thing to teach a 
native cook the fundamental rules of this part of his work, 
for they are simple. The labour is so slight that, if suffi- 
ciently devoted to your task, you can select a recipe and 
absolutely show the man step by step how to carry it out. 
For a demonstration of this kind, you must, of course, 
order all the ingredients you may require beforehand, and 
have a mineral oil-stove, or brazier of charcoal, brought 
into a sheltered verandah, or spare room. The trouble 
this may cost you will, in nine cases out of ten, be amply 
repaid, for with the native mind practical proof is far more 
effective than theoretical discussion. 



SAUCES. 79 



For sauce-making, in general, you must possess four or 
fire small sauce-pans in sizes, a bain-marie pan to set tliem 
in, a small pair of scales, two wooden spoons, a plated spoon 
of each size, a flour dredger, a couple of eartlienware bowls, 
a block tin perforated strainer (a pointed one for choice) 
with handle, a wire sieve, a hair sieve, and a mortar. 

The materials you will call into play from time to time 
will be : — butter, flour, eggs, pepper, salt, onions, limes, a 
few cloves of garlic, spices, the contents of your cruet- 
stand, say : — Harvey, and mushroom ketchup ; anchovy, 
chilli, tarragon, and French vinegars ; besides mustard, 
with pickled gherkins, capers, and red-currant jelly. Care- 
fully-made gravy, broth, or stock, will generally be want- 
ed, for which special provision must be made, but for 
ordinary sauces, you can generally manage to make enough 
broth from scraps and trimmings. In doing this you have 
the consolation of knowing that there is nothing wasted. 
Sundry spoonfuls of red or white wine will be necessary 
now and then, and if you wander beyond the Rubicon of 
moderation to the realms of high art, you will naturally ask 
for champagne, truffles, cocks-combs, cream, mushrooms, 
and olives. 

Of all writers upon cookery none has dealt more clearly 
with the subject of sauces than Jules Gouffe. His work 
may appear difficult to understand in places, and his recipes 
may seem frequently composed upon too large a scale to 
be useful to mistresses of small establishments, but in the 
system that he has adopted with regard to this important 
feature of kitchen work, he has hit the right nail upon the 
head. He classes as fundamental sauces, — from which 
nearly the whole category may be said to have sprung, — 
those well-known names Espagyiole, VeloutS, Allemande^ 
Bechamel and Poivrade ; and even of these, the first two 
may be considered as the parents of the rest.

There are nevertheless several standing sauces which 
must be spoken of independently ; for instance, melted 
butter (sauce blanche), Hollandaise, sonhise, maitre dlwtel, 
bread sauce, mayonnaise, tart are, remoulade, ravigote, 
Eohert, piquante, S)'c. Let us take these first, for they are 
perhaps more simple, and oftenei* in request than Espag- 
nole, veloute, and their various descendants. 

Failure in the composition of melted butter (sauce 
blanche) is so common, that I will commence with a few 
hints with regard to that homely preparation. The pith 
of this sauce consists in melting your lump of butter (good 
butter mind) first at the bottom of your sauce-pan, then to 
add the flour, which soon amalgamates with the melted 
butter, and then by degrees the water, or milk and water 
(boiling) with a pinch of salt. Work this well with a 
wooden spoon till it is soft and creamy to look upon, pass 
it through your tin strainer into a hot sauce boat, and, as 
you serve it, add a pat of fresh butter the size of a rupee, 
which will, of course, melt of its own accord, and give 
that ' buttery' flavour which you desire — not that ' flour- 
and-watery' one so suggestive of the composition you 
would employ for fixing scraps in an album. 

For a pint of white sauce, you will require two ounces 
and a half of butter, two ounces of flour, a salt-spoonful of 
salt, and a pint of broth, or milk and water. Use two 
ounces of butter, and the flour first, and save the extra half 
ounce of butter to finish with. 

A pinch of sugar assists all white sauces. 

Please observe that milh is not absolutely necessary in 
making " white sauce." The chief objection to its use is, 
that, in this country, it causes the sauce with which it may 
be used to turn sour the next day. I consequently advo- 
cate the use of broth, made from chicken bones or mutton 
scraps, instead of milk. Broth enriches the sauce, and if 



SAUCES. 81 



strong, makes it equal to sauce blonde. The water in 
which peas, carrots, onions, celery, and leeks, have been 
boiled may be used advantageously for this purpose. 

If required for fish the liquor in which the fish was 
boiled reduced by rapid boiling ; or a broth made from the 
bones, fins, and trimmings separately simmered should be 
used. 

The common error in making white sauce is the stirring 
of flour into the sauce, which produces the effect required 
at the expense of double the necessary quantity of flour ; 
for the lumps strained off are utterly wasted. A too spar- 
ing use of butter is another cardinal mistake. 

With Jialf a pint of satice hlanclie you can work out 
several tasty recipes given by the " G. C." as follows : — 

Beat up the yolk of an egg, and the juice of a couple of 
limes ; strain, and add to your melted butter just before 
serving ; off the fire mind, or the sauce will curdle. 

Beat up the yolk of an egg with a table-spoonful of 
cream, and add in the same way. 

Throw in just before serving a table- spoonful of minced 
parsley, fennel, or chopped capers, and you will have : — 
sauce au persil, sauce au fenouil, or satice aux cdpres. 

Stir into it after it is made, a dessert-spoonful (or more 
if liked) of anchovy, Harvey, ketchup, or any sauce you 
fancy. 

For sauce aux fines Jierhes, flavour a pint of milk by boil- 
ing up in it a minced Bombay onion, a tiny bit of garlic, 
and a handful of parsley : when well flavoured, strain the 
milk through muslin and stir it by degrees into a sauce- 
pan in which a couple of ounces of butter and two of flour 
have been mixed ; thicken gently by bringing the mixture 
to the boil, strain, and add, just before serving, a table- 



82 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

spoonful of minced cui4ed parsley, a dessert-spoonful of 
chopped garden cress, and half one of chopped green stem 
of spring onion. A squeeze of a lime may be judiciously 
added to this sauce. 

Fillets of pomfret, or any fish that you can fillet nicely, 
stewed gently in milk thus flavoured, with the same thick- 
ened and poured over them when done, are excellent. 

Small rings of sliced gherkins added to plain melted 
butter form the sauce aux cornichous you remember abroad ; 
a tea-spoonful of tarragon vinegar should accompany the 
rings. 

Melted butter for sweet entremets such as cabinet pud- 
ding, et hoc genus omne, should be made exactly in the same 
way as sance hlancJie, with sugar instead of salt, with milk, 
or milk and water, and an egg beaten up in brandy, sherry, 
or liqueur. 

By adding strong broth or stock to the butter and flour, 
instead of milk and water as in saiice hlanche, you produce 
sauce hlonde which forms the basis of several useful 
sauces. 

Maitre cVhotel is simply sauce blonde with a bountiful 
supply of finely minced parsley, a half pinch of spiced 
pepper, finished off the fire w4th the yolk of an egg, and 
a squeeze of lime juice. 

Mincing parsley requires attention. If done when the 
leaves are tvet, the pieces will all stick together, and much 
of the juice will be lost. Parsley must be washed and 
then carefully dried in a cloth, after which it can be chop- 
ped as finely as possible. 

Maitre dliotel butter, I may add par parenthese is made 
thus : — To two ounces of iced fresh butter, add the juice 
of one lime, a dessert- spoonful of chopped parsley free from 
moisture, a little white pepper, and a pinch of salt. Form 



SAUCES. 83 



it with jonr butter bat, and set it in the ice box. A nice 
juicy, grilled chop, or a little grilled fillet of beef, served 
with a piece of maitre d' hotel butter melting over it, is a 
French method of captivating the appetite. 

Sauce a la poulette is worthy of distinction among ordi- 
nary white sauces. Its chief points are : first, that it is 
thickened with the yolks of eggs instead of flour ; secondly, 
that it is garnished with button mushrooms. It is a 
creamy looking sauce the colour of a rich custard. Make 
an ordinary thin sauce hlonde with one pint of chicken 
broth, one ounce of butter, one ounce of flour, pepper and 
salt to taste : stir well for a quarter of an hour, and it will 
be a thin white sauce : then add en hain-inarie one by one 
the strained and well beaten yolks of three eggs, finish off 
with a pat of butter, and a couple of table-spoonfuls of 
chopped mushrooms. 

The pulp of some large sweet onions that have been 
simmered in milk till tender, and passed through the sieve, 
when worked into sauce hlonde, with a spoonful of cream 
for high days and holidays, gives you sauce soubise. 

Equal portions of boiled carrot, French beans, turnip or 
knolkhol, cut into small dice, with a few peas, asparagus 
points, and haricot beans, and gently heated in sauce hlonde^ 
form that charming assistance to a dish of grilled cutlets, 
or any plain entree, called macedoine de legumes. Be care- 
ful not to masli the vegetables, so do not overboil them in 
the first instance.* 

Sauce Milanaise is a delicious variation of sauce souhise. 
Cut up two parboiled Bombay onions, and put them into 
a sauce-pan with an ounce of butter, a pinch of sugar, and 
a salt-spoonful of salt ; add a table-spoonful of previously 
boiled rice, or pearl barley, and moisten with a breakfast- 

* Any four of these vegetables are enough for a macedoine. — W. 



84 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

cupful of broth ; let them cook slowly, and when the onions 
are done, add a table-spoonful of finely grated mild cheese 
(Parmesan for choice), stir the mixtui-e, pass it through 
a sieve, and mingle it with half a pint of rich sauce blonde, 
or — for your birthday, wedding day, or the christening 
day of your first baby — with boiling cream. 

There is no sauce more popular with judges of good 
food than SoUandaise ; in perfection it is a grand sauce, 
and not very easy to make. In its homely form it may 
be described as sauce blanche, to which a few yolks of eggf>, 
have been added, and a squeeze of lime juice. In its more 
elaborate treatment, it becomes a custard of volks of egsrs 
water, vinegar or lime juice, and butter. Some are in 
favour of vinegar, others prefer lime juice, which they 
work thus : Beat up the yolks of three eggs in a little 
water in which a salt-spoonful of pounded allspice has 
been dissolved, add salt to taste, and about three ounces 
of fresh butter. Put this mixture into a small sauce-pan, 
and plunge it into a bain-marie, or stew-pan large cnougli 
to receive it, full of boiling water : steam your mixture in 
this way till it thickens, and stir in your lime juice to 
finish with. 

Gouffe's recipe may be condensed in this way : — reduce 
two table-spoonfuls of vinegar on the fire with a little salt 
and pepper added to it, till about a tea-spoonful remains : — 
strain, and add to it two table-spoonfuls of water, and two 
yolks of eggs ; put this on the fire and heat it thoroughly, 
stirring it well with a wooden spoon, and add four ounces 
of butter ounce by ounce by degrees, with a little water 
now and then to prevent its curdling. This process had 
better be carried out in a bain-marie, for you thus obtain 
the amount of gentle heat which is necessary to preserve 
the sauce in a velvety condition without risk of any kind. 

Those capital compositions mayonnaise, tartar e, remoul- 



SAUCES. 85 



ade, ravigote, Sfc, are better known as cold sauces, but there 
are liot forms of preparing tartar e and tbe two last named 
not often presented. They are descended from saiLce 
piqua7ite which is simply made in this way : — 

Fry in two ounces of melted butter an ounce of minced 
onion with an ounce of chopped carrot, a dessert-spoonful 
of parsley, one of garden cress, and one clove of garlic. 
When of a golden hue, add equal parts (claret-glass each) 
of vinegar, and water, or broth and vinegar, a tea-spoonful 
of salt, and one of sugar, strain, and serve hot. Some 
chopped truffles, gherkins, capers, or mushrooms may be 
added with good effect, and a spoonful of ketchup, or Har- 
vey, is often given to it as a finishing touch. This sauce 
is not thickened. 

For hot tart are, add a large spoonful of mustard to the 
above, and use tarragon vinegar. 

For ravigote, you thicken with a little flour, and add a 
very little white wine, and minced shallots with some lime- 
juice instead of vinegar. 

For remoulade, use neither lime nor wine, but incorporate 
with your frying onions and green herbs, a table -spoonful 
of salad oil, and add a dessert-spoonful of French mustard 
to finish with. 

Sauce poivrade {maigre) is made like sauce piqiiante, 
with this exception, that affer the straining, you thicken 
the liquor with butter and flour, it may be served either 
white or brown as you may desire. If you want it white, 
the onions must not be allowed to take colour in the frying 
stage. 

Grouffe's brown poivrade is enriched with EspagnoJe, and 
his poivrade blanche with veloute. But these are first class 
sauces, of which more anon. 

Sauce Robert belongs to this family : — Chop up a fine 
sweet onion, throw the mince into a sauce-pan with an

86 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

ounce of bntter. Let it take colour, then add an ounce of 
flour by degi'ees, and when that has been well worked, 
half a pint of graTj, pepper and salt at disci^etion, and a 
pinch of sugar. When thoroughly mixed, and piping hot, 
pass the sauce through the tin strainer, catching up all 
lumps, and, at the last moment, stir in a table-spoonful of 
vinegar, and one of mixed mustard. Excellent with pork, 
veal, duck, and goose. 

Mustard sauce is made in this way : — Melt a couple of 
ounces of butter in a small sauce-pan, blend with it a 
dessert-spoonful of flour, and a heaped up tea-spoonful of 
French mustard with a pinch of salt : when thoroughly 
mixed, add half a pint of broth or water : let it come to 
the boil, then strain through the pointed strainer into a 
hot sauce-boat. If Durham mustard is used, a little vine- 
gar must be added. 

These sharp relishes go well with fish, and, as a change, 
are welcome with cutlets, etc.

Sauces— continued. 

¥ the whole category o£ simple sauces none is more 
_ g-enerally maltreated than " bread-sauce." Deli- 
cious when properly made, it is positively a re- 
pulsive mess when wrongly treated. You have no doubt 
lamented many a time over the wretched compound which 
your cook persists in sending up under this title ; and I 
have heard people say that true "bread-sauce" cannot be 
made in India. Now, I have tasted quite as nasty a com- 
position as Ramasamy's in England, in fact even there you 
more frequently get it bad, than good. The good " bread- 
sauce," now served at the junior United Service Club in 
London, is due to the admonitions of an officer, once well 
known in Madras. 

The system pursued by the ignorant cook may be thus 
described : — he cuts some slices of bread, or grates bread- 
crumbs enough for his requirements, over which he pours 
a tea-cupful of boiling ivater, he gives that a pinch of salt, 
perhaps (but by no means for certain) a spoonful of milk, 
and a quantity of whole pepper corns, and cloves ; he stirs 
this to the consistency of thick porridge, and finally sends 
up a mixture which may be plainly described as spiced 
bread poultice ! 

Setting aside other considerations for a moment, can 
anything be more disagreeable than the accidental biting 



88 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

of a ichole clove, or a pepper corn, in any dish or sauce ? 
Common sense accordingly dictates that when the use of 
these condiments is necessary, vre should strain the liquid 
in which they have been placed befoi^ serving it. 

The back-bone of " bread-sauce" is the flavouring of the 
milk with which it is made, to begin with ; that done, to 
strain it carefully over your grated crumbs ; then to 
re-heat it, and finish it off with a good table-spoonful of 
creavi at the moment you serve it. In the absence of 
cream, the yolk of one egg, beaten up in a little milk till 
it looks creamy, may be added, off the fire, just at the last> 
but cream should be used if possible. 

To flavour the milk, you must take a good sized white 
onion, peel off the outside skin, cut it into quarters, and 
pnt them, with a dozen pepper coras, six cloves, a blade 
of mace, a pinch of gi\ated nutmeg, and a salt-spoonful of 
salt, into a sauce-pan containing not less than half a pint 
of good milk. The utmost care is now necessary, for milk 
boils up so rapidly that you must watch your sauce-pan 
narrowly, and use a very low fire to retard the boiling- 
stage. Remove the pan as soon as the sui'face of the milk 
looks frothy : let it cool a little, and replace it, continuing 
the operation until the onion is done, and adding a little 
milk from time to time to make good the loss by evapora- 
tion. Now, strain it off through a piece of muslin into a 
bowl, and add to it, spoonful by spoonful, the stale bread- 
crumbs you have abeady prepared, till your eye tells you 
that you have attained the right consistency ; then heat 
the sauce up again, and finish it as I have already de- 
scribed. 

I can always rely upon making as good a " bread-sauce" 
here as I ever ate in England, but then I would never 
attempt it unless I had all the ingredients at my command. 
There can be no evasion of the milk. "Water at once pro- 



SAUCES— CONTINUED. 89 

duces the poultice I liave condenmed, and tlie spoonful of 
cream, must be added if you desire success. 

This sauce richly deserves the trouble I have prescribed, 
and it will be found in the end economical, for by its aid a 
carefully-roasted fowl provides an enjoyable meal ; whilst 
fillets of partridges, or chicken, bread-crumbed, nicely fried, 
and garnished with a crisp curl or two of fried bacon, 
assume at once a superior character. A young pigeon, 
split, and grilled over a fast fire, besprinkled with fried 
bread-crumbs, and assisted by good bread-sauce, forms 
a nice luncheon for a lady whose husband's days are spent 
at office, or for a convalescent beginning to mend after a 
long illness. 

To continue simple sauces : — that known as Sauce an 
pauvre liomme is produced by first frying a minced onion 
in a little butter until it assumes a golden brown tint, and 
then pouring in a little broth made from scraps, with a 
tea-spoonful of vinegar : you must give this a boil, and 
then strain it by degrees into another sauce-pan contain- 
ing melted butter and flour ; work this well with a wooden 
spoon and add a pinch of salt, one of sugar, a little pepper, 
and some minced parsley. 

Dutch sauce as eaten in Holland, the veritable ' Hollan- 
daise,' is butter plainly melted in a sauce-pan, flavoured 
with a little pepper, a little salt, and the squeeze of a 
lemon ; this is allowed to settle over the fire, and is then 
poured free from the sediment at the bottom of the pan, 
into a piping hot metal sauce-boat. This sauce is admir- 
able with fish, asparagus, and all green vegetables ; you 
must, of course, substitute lime for lemon, and have butter 
enough to spare for the undertaking. I strongly advise 
my fortunate friends on the Neilgherries to make this 
sauce (a little goes a long way mind) for their globe arti- 



90 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

chokes ; one table- spoonful is enough for one artichoke, 
and the plates should be really hot.* 

Hollandaise made with eggs is known abroad as Hollan- 
daise jaune. 

*' Horse-radish sauce" is the gi'and standard adjunct to 
our national food, " the roast beef of old England," and 
beef in India cries out for help far more piteouslj than its 
rich relation far away. Horse-radish grows well at Ootaca- 
mund, and I once grew some with success at Bangalore, 
but the scraped root of the moringa, or " drum-stick" tree, 
provides so good a substitute that we may rest contented 
with a sauce thus composed : — Scrape as finely as you can 
a cupful of the root shavings, simmer them in half a pint 
of chicken broth ; when done, thicken the broth custard- 
wise with the yolks of three eggs beaten up with a dessert- 
spoonful of tarragon vinegar ; add popper, salt, and a very 
little grated nutmeg, and serve in a sauce-boat. 

A richer recipe suggests the addition of a coffee-cupful 
of cream wdth the yolks of the eggs, and then to let the 
sauce remain on the fii^e en hain-marie, stirring well until 
it is very hot (but not boiling) and serving it in a hot 
sauce-boat. 

The cold form of this sauce is perhaps the easiest, and 
I think as nice as any t : — you simply rasp the moringa, or 
horse-radish root, till you have a cupful of fine scrapings, 
and mingle them with an ordinary mayonnaise, or tartare 
sauce, iced. Cream is, of coui'se, a great addition, but the 
usual mixture of eggs, oil, mustard, and vinegar, will give 
you a good result. 

And this leads me to discuss at once the two sauces I 
have just mentioned.

SAUCES— CONTINUED 91 

Mayonnaise sauce is certainly one of the most useful, and 
popular of all the sauces we attempt out here. In order- 
ing it, if you know what to say, and give good materials, 
you may be certain of success. Be sure that the oil you 
give is thoroughly good, or the result will be very painful ; 
and examine your mustard, vinegar, and eggs. Assuming 
that these are all satisfactory, set to work in the following 
manner : — 

Commence with the dry ingredients, and put into a 
soup-plate, or slop-basin, the cold, very hard-boiled yolks 
of two eggs, a salt-spoonful of salt, a dessert-spoonful of 
mustard powder, a tea-spoonful of finely-minced shallot, 
and a dust of white pepper. Bruise these together 
thoroughly with the back of a silver spoon. Now, add a 
little oil, and work your materials to a paste, dropping 
in the oil patiently by degrees until you get it nice and 
moist; next throw in the yolks of two raw eggs, and 
continue your working, adding oil without measure, and 
judging by your eye when you think you have made 
enough sauce, for the tarragon vinegar you finally add 
will not be more than a good table-spoonful. The moment 
the vinegar is added, the sauce will assume a creamy 
appearance, and when worked sufficiently, will be ready 
for the block tin strainer (to get rid of " onion atoms," 
lumps of egg, &c.,) and then for the table. If made on 
the plains, early in the afternoon, the sauce-boat should be 
placed in the ice-box ; but, to be successful, mayonnaise 
sauce ought, if possible, to be made as near the time of 
service as possible. "When cream is used, it takes the place 
of the oil, but if only a little can be spared, a dessert-spoon- 
ful may be added to the sauce I have described with good 
effect. All mayonnaise sauces should he iced, if only for a 
few minutes. 

The points in this sauce to be noted are, the order in 
which the various ingredients should be employed, the use 



92 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

of the raw yolks in conjunction with the hard-boiled (they 
produce the thick creaminess you want), the liberal use of 
good oil, and the addition last of all, in sparing quantity, 
of the tarragon vinegar. You do not want an acid sauce 
at all, remember. English cooks, as a rule, ruin their 
mayonnaise and salad dressings, by measuring the oil and 
vinegar they use in equal portions ! No artist measures 
these ingredients.* You might as well expect a painter 
to tell you the number of gi^ains of the colours he used in 
painting a pictuiT. You must not omit a little onion, but 
whilst permitting the flavour " scarce suspected to animate 
the whole," you must on no account permit the " atoms to 
lui'k within the bowl" — the ladies in Sydney Smith's days 
were perhaps less critical in the matter of this fragrant 
bulb, than are our fail' enslavers in the present year of 
gi-ace. 

" Tar tare sauce" is the same as the above, without the 
use of hard-boiled eggs : raw yolks alone should be used, 
and the oil and vinegar should be added in the following 
proportions ; a tea-spoonful of the latter, to two table- 
spoonfuls of the former, well beaten together, and often 
times repeated till enough sauce is made. 

" Bemoulade'^ is a mayonnaise sauce with chopped 
gherkins, parsley, chives and capers, added. For chives, 
try the green stalks of a few young onions. The mustard 
used must be French, and a drop or two of garlic-vinegar 
is a sine qtid nan. 

" Bavigote'' is also mayonnaise with chopped shallots 
anchovies, celery, cress, and sweet herbs. 

Green remoulade and ravigote are made in the same way, 
the colour being produced by parsley juice, and spinach- 
greening. 

* Gonffe's calculation represents the quantity of vinegar as barelj 
one-eighth of the oil. — W. 



SA UCES— CONTINUED. 93 

Not long ago I observed in the Queen newspaper a ques- 
tion from a ladj who was apparently in great distress 
about mayonnaise sauce. She complained that she could 
not get the mixture as thich as she desired, and begged 
for instruction. Two answers were given the following 
week : one of them urged the lady to thicken with flour 
or arro^^T?oot, and the other advocated mashed potato ! 
Now, I need scarcely say that this was a case in which the 
blind attempted to lead the blind. Mayonnaise and tar- 
tare sauces should be thickened by beating the oil and 
raw yolks together perseveringly. With patience the 
mixture can, in this way, be made to stand as stiffly as 
thick batter.

Sauces— concluded. 

fXOW pass to the consideration of a few standard liigh 
class sauces, which, with a little care and attention, 
will be found practicable in every well-conducted 
^Madras kitchen. To aid you in this branch of the cook's 
art, you cannot possess a better guide than Jules Gouffe, 
whose admirably systematic method of discussing sauces 
has never been approached by any authority on culinary 
mysteries. Unfortunately, however for the inexperienced 
reader, Gouffe's work is rather the treatise of a Professor 
addi'essed to students who have already matriculated, 
than a vade mecum for beginners. So unless you are 
fairly au fait in practical kitchen work, you will hardly 
derive much easy aid from the Royal Cookery Book. You 
must have some knowledge of the ingredients which may 
possibly be spared, and of those which must, on no account, 
be omitted, for even in Gouffe's recipes there are sometimes 
things named which are not absolutely essential. Yoa 
ought to know something of stock-making, and understand 
the value of game bones, poultry bones, fragments of ham, 
&c., and the sort of flavour these things produce, helped 
by certain vegetables. If, by experience, you have picked 
up a knowledge of equivalents so much the better. I can, 
in short, readily believe that those who have never 
bothered their heads about cookery, would find it almost 



SAUCES— CONCLUDED. 95 

impossible to direct a native cook from the pages of the 
great chef. In saying this I speak from experience. I 
first read Gouffe before I had taken to practical cooking 
work, and before I had actually made sauces, &c., ladle in 
hand, in an English kitchen. Since going through that 
ordeal, I have again come across the book, and I find that 
much that I had formerly to skip as too complicated, now 
seems easy enough. 

I propose now to place before you in the simplest way I 
can G-ouffe's fundamental sauces. Those who are ac- 
quainted with that author, will observe that in the first 
place I shall reduce the recipes to a much shorter compass, 
and in the next, that I shall omit everything that is not 
down-right necessary to produce a fair result. 

Gouffe propounds the following sauces as the found- 
ation of nearly all those of a high class that you are likely 
to encounter : — 



1. 


Espagiiole. 


4. 


BScJiamel. 


2. 


VeloutS. 


5. 


Marinade. 


3. 


Allemande. 


6. 


Poivrade. 



Of these veloute, allemande, and hechamel are so closely 
allied, that I shall confine myself to the last. Marinade 
and poivrade I have already alluded to. Espagnole is, of 
course, worthy of close attention. My fundamental sauces 
will then be reduced to two : — one brown, the other 
white, — which I think will be found ample for the Indian 
kitchen. 

Veal stock plays an important part in Gouffe's recipes. 
Unfortunately for us we can never reckon on obtaining 
' that delicate meat. Nevertheless, while freely admitting 
! its value, I do not look upon veal as a sine qua non in 
j sauce-making. A really carefully made chicken consomyne, 
\ assisted by a ham or bacon bone, and on special occasions 



96 CULINARY JOTTIKGS FOR MADRAS. 

with a good fowl, provides you with an excellent equiva- 
lent. 

"SVith regard to Espagnole which, as many of you no 
doubt know, is a rich, thick, hroion sauce, I would simplify 
Gouffe's receipt as follows : — Get ready a couple of sheep's 
trotters chopped in pieces, with a ham or bacon bone, or a 
few lean slices of either, any raw cutlet trimmings you 
may have, and two pounds of beef gravy meat cut into 
squares. Xow cut up a couple of onions and throw them 
into a stew-pan with an ounce of butter, fry them a golden 
yellow then add a breakfast-cupful of broth, or water, and 
the pieces of meat previously prepared ; shake the pan every 
now and then, and let the meat take colour; now, add 
water enough to cover the meat, etc., completely, reduce 
the fire, and let the contents of the pan come slowly to the 
boil, skimming carefully during that period ; when the 
surface seems nicely clear of grease and scum, add a cupful 
of cold water and two carrots sliced, a turnip, a good piece 
of celery, a clove of garlic, half a dozen of pepper corns, a 
spoonful of dried sweet herbs tied up in a bag, a bunch 
of parsley, some burnt sugar colouring, and salt to taste. 
Ko spice. As soon as the vegetables have been cooked, 
remove the pan from the fire, pick out the vegetables, 
and place it so that it may simmer slowly for a couple of 
hours. Xow, lift it up, and strain off your gravy : there 
should be quite a pint and a half of it. Next, take a 
sauce-pan and melt two ounces of butter at the bottom of 
it, stir in two ounces of flour and make a rou.r, when the 
colour satisfies you, add by degrees, stirring as you do so, 
the pint or so of strong gravy that you strained from the 
stew-pan. Let the contents of your sauce-pan come to the 
boil, stirring the whole time, then strain the sauce through 
your tin strainer into a clean sauce-pan, and set the vessel 
in the hain-marie to remain hot till wanted. Any fat that 
may rise dui^ing the thickening process should be skim- 



SA UCES—CONCL UDED. 97 

med off, but if the gravy be properly made, and skimmed 
before it is added to the roux^ there will be very little to 
take off in the hain-marie stage. The hain-marie, remem- 
ber, is a vessel containing boiling water, and kept over the 
fire, in which yon immerse sauce-pans containing made- 
sauces to preserve them hot for use. 

Espagnole sauce, therefore, is simply a good, rich, brown, 
meat g^ravy, thickened with flour. It only possesses the 
flavour derived from the vegetables, and from the ordinary 
meat that you have employed to make it. Using this 
sauce as your medium or basis, you can proceed to compose 
a number of rich preparations as follows : — Financiere, 
Perigueux, Bordelaise, Provengale, Genevoise, Matelote^ 
Chdteauhriand, Begence, Italienne, and Reforme, with others 
too numerous to mention. The spScialites of the sauces, I 
have enumerated, consist in the distinct flavouring of the 
Espagnole, from which they are really made, with mush- 
rooms, truffles, essence of game or of pigeons, poultry, fish, 
or ham (concerning which I shall speak later on), wine 
in judicious proportions, delicate vegetables, and so on. 
A careful perusal of the receipts given, hereafter in my 
menus, ought to guide you, when once you have achieved an 
undeniable foundation with your Espagnole. 

Game fragments, poultry, mushrooms, &c., must, on no 
account, be used in making Espagnole, for such ingredients 
would impart a distinct flavour to the sauce. The object, 
remember, is to reserve the flavoui'ing according to the 
particular sauce we may select. 

I will, for example, give you saiice a la Perigueux : — 
Chop up half the contents of a small bottle of truffles, and 
toss them awhile in some melted butter at the bottom of a 
light sauce-pan, add a coffee-cupful of clear gravy, and 
a glass of Madeii-a, and simmer for ten minutes ; give it 
a little pepper, a pinch of sugar, and salt, and then slowly 

9 



98 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

stir in half a pint of Espagnole to complete the sauce, and 
when thoroughly hot, it is ready. 

Take now Financiere sauce for, let us say, a ragout of 
that name : — Choose a nice tender fowl, lightly roast it, 
and save the choicest fillet meat for your ragout : take the 
legs, thighs, skin, bones, liver, giblets, scraps, and trim- 
mings, and proceed to make an essence of them thus : — Break 
up the bones, and, with the remnants aforesaid, make the 
strongest broth you can, flavoured with an onion, a bit of 
celery, a spoonful of dried herbs, a sliced carrot, and two or 
three pepper corns. Reduce it as strong as possible, and 
then strain. Now, take equal portions of mushrooms and 
of truffles ; cut them up, and toss them in melted butter 
at the bottom of a sauce-pan, and when you have worked 
them well thus, for two or three minutes, add your fowl- 
cssence, with a glass of sherry, and complete the sauce 
with your pint of Espagnole. The ragout (which should 
be garnished with whole button mushrooms, sliced truffles, 
cocks-combs, sweet-breads, tongue, grated ham, and sip- 
pets of crisply fried bacon) is merely a careful stew of 
fowl fillets, in the sauce I have described. As the fillets 
have been previously cooked, they will merely require 
gently heating up in the sauce. 

It will be observed that the specialiles of the two sauces 
just given are a flavour of truffles and Madeira in Perigueux, 
and of chicken essence with mushrooms, truffles, and 
sherry in Financiere. 

Bechamel, which I select as the best type of a funda- 
mental white sauce, should be made in this way : — Take 
the same ingTcdients that I have detailed for Espagnole, 
and commence by slicing up the onion, and shaking the 
rings in an ounce of melted butter at the bottom of the 
stew-pan ; do not let them take colour, but add your meat* 

* Veal, if procurable, instead of beef. — W. 



SAUCES— CONCLUDED. 99 

and bones at once, and cover them with water, omitting 
the browning stage : go on now to make a clear consomme ; 
instead of burnt-sugar colouring, add a tea-spoonful of 
powdered sugar plain, and all the vegetables. If this be 
carefully prepared and skimmed, you will obtain a pellucid 
broth which should be strained, and kept ready for use 
presently. Take a sauce-pan, and melt a quarter of a 
pound of "cow-brand," or any good preserved butter in 
it ; fry gently in that for ten minutes a sliced carrot and a 
sliced onion ; before they take colour, add two ounces of 
flour, stir for five minutes, and add by degrees your clear 
broth, half a pint of cream, a small tinful of mushrooms 
chopped, salt, and pepper ; stir over the fire till boiling, 
and then permit the sauce to simmer slowly for an hour, 
taking off all fat that may rise. At the end of the hour, 
you can strain the Bechamel into a sauce-pan, and place it 
in the bain-marie. Before using, a gill of cream may be 
finally stirred into the sauce as you take it from the hain- 
marie. 

Veloute is exactly like this omitting the cream when you 
add the stock, and also the chopped mushrooms : it is 
therefore less expensive and not quite so rich. 

Allemande is veloute flavoured with chicken essence, and 
chopped mushrooms : it is thickened with yolks of eggs, 
and no cream is needed in its composition. 

With these for your bases, you can make the following 
rich white sauces : — oyster, lobster, supreme, venitienne, 
poivrade bla7iche, rich souhise, champignons blanches, puree 
de celeri, and other rich white -purees. In fact all sauces 
which, in their simple form, are made with sauce blanche, 
or sauce blonde, may be served in a superior manner by 
using veloute, or Bechamel as their groundwork. 

I have already described the making of chicken, or 
rather fowl essence : the same principles being observed,

you can obtain valuable flavouring gravies from all poul- 
try bones, especially from those of a turkey. The giblets 
should never be thrown away, for they assist a gravy 
greatly. In like manner game bones are very valuable. 

Essences of mushrooms, of truffles, vegetables, and ham, 
are obtained by stewing them cut into small pieces in con- 
somme. 

A dash of Madeira or sound !^^arsala is necessary with 
game essences, while chablis and sauterne give assistance 
to fish gravies which are used, of course, to improve sauces 
like creme d'ajichois, crcme de crevettes, and all fish sauces. 

Reduced vinegar, i.e. vinegar boiled until half or more 
of its quantity has evaporated, and wine similarly reduced, 
produce valuable flavoring agents. 

■ Mirepoix is a strong broth made from meat and vege- 
tables, flavoured with wine and sweet herbs, and strained, 
hut not thickened. It is used as a flavouring medium. 

D'UxelleSy or fines herhes, is composed as follows : — Cho]) 
up six ounces of fresh mu.shrooms, six ounces of fresh 
parsley, and two ounces of shallot, put the mince into a 
stew-pan with two ounces of fresh butter and a seasoning 
of salt and black pepper ; fry on a brisk fire for five 
minutes, and put the mixture in a jar for use as required. 
D'U.relIes sauce is made by adding a table-spoonful of this 
preparation to half a pint of Espagnole sauce. This should 
be made when mushrooms are procurable during the rains, 
it will be found most useful as a flavoring and finishing 
agent. 

Let us suppose that you have made a sauce in every 
way satisfactorily, but find that it is scarcely thick enough. 
You must then employ a liaison or thickening to correct 
the error. Liaison for a white sauce may be made of flour, 
and a little milk and water, or white stock, like sauce 
hlanche, or sa^ice hlonde only a little thicker. For a brown 



SA UCES—CONCL UDED.

sauce the same, with brown gravy. In either case the 
liaison mixed separately is stirred through a strainer into 
the sauce off the fire : when this has been done, the sauce- 
pan is replaced on the fire and stirred until the desired 
thickness is obtained. 

Yolks of eggs are also used for liaison : they must be 
beaten up with a little hot- water, or stock, and added to 
the sauce off the fire, the thickening being very carefully 
conducted afterwards over a low fire as in custard-making. 
The sauce must be allowed to cool for two or three minutes 
before the egg thickening is put into it. This thickening 
is used in poulette sauce iov fricassees and certain soups. 

I have now, I think, given you a sketch of sauce-making 
in its various stages. Details for nearly every standard 
sauce not at present described, will be found in my menus.

Roasting and braising. 

IVE me," says the Englishman, " a good cut of a 
well-cooked joint, with a nicely boiled potato, 
and a fresh vegetable, and I will ask for nothing 
more." Now, it must be admitted, that honest slices of 
meat constitute the favorite dinner of a Briton. Go into 
a Club dining-room, or into any large London tavern sucli 
as " Simpson's," " The Rainbow," &c., &c., and you will 
find two-thirds of the men assembled there dining " off the 
joint." And verily the well roasted haunch or saddle of 
mutton, the sirloin or round of beef, the fillet of veal, and 
the loin or leg of pork, are dishes peculiar to England, of 
which we may well boast. Our artistic neighbours across 
the channel are wont to sneer at our love of great joints, 
which they fail to cook as well as we do, for although in 
deference to the insular taste " ross biff" frequently figures 
in a Parisian menu, I think that men are unanimous in 
saying that it never comes up to the home-fed, home-served 
sirloin. 

Our penchant for solid food follows us withersoever we 
wander away from home, and we find John Bull in India 
as fond of his beef and mutton, as he was when " a humble 
cottager in Britain." He sighs for a Southdown saddle 
or a Scotch sirloin, and is apt to turn away sorrowfully 
from the meagre travesty of a joint, which, after much 



ROASTING AND BRAISING. 103 

trouble, the sharer of his joys and sorrows contrives to 
place before him. 

Now, although a vast quantity of wretched meat is sold 
in the Indian market, I think that people who are willing 
to pay a good price, and whose servants are not unusually 
dishonest, can generally get fair beef and mutton at the 
large stations of this Presidency. A really bad servant 
will, of course, cheat you with greater cruelty in buying 
your meat than in anything. At some places the beef is 
better than the mutton, and vice versa, but I think that, if 
not haggled with over his prices, a batcher is generally to be 
found w^ho can supply you with eatable meat. Owing to 
the calamity which befell us in 1877, and the two previous 
seasons of scarcity, our market has, for the past few years, 
been hardly as well supplied as it formerly was ; never- 
theless, good meat is to be got. 

The comparative scarcity, however, of eatable meat is in 
a srreat measure due to ourselves. If the butchers were 
certain of sales at remunerative prices, they would pro- 
duce a far better article than they do, but when people 
grumble at an extra anna charged on a seer of well-fed 
meat, you can scarcely expect much improvement. The 
expenses attending sheep-feeding are pretty well proved 
by the statistics of the old-established mutton clubs in 
the mofussil. The members, it is true, get capital meat, 
but it costs them, first and last, very nearly what it would 
in England. Native graziers can hardly be expected to 
turn out equally good mutton at a cheaper rate. 

Setting aside the joints that you occasionally get when 
a stall-fed ox has been slaughtered, or a gram-fed sheep 
cut up ; and without considering the exceptionally good 
meat of mutton clubs, it is the duty of the chronicler of 
these " jottings" to treat of the average produce of the 
country, and to endeavour to provide his readers with a 



104 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

few useful hints as to the cookery thereof. Let us there- 
fore take the ordinary joint of beef or of mutton which 
Ramasamy brings daily from bazar for " Master and Mrs. 
only" : — the diminutive sii'loin, the ribs scarcely larger 
than the loin chops of a Leicestershire sheep, the three- 
and-a-half pound leg of mutton, or the wizen loinlct, — and 
let us assume that the meat, though small, is faii-ly good, — 
what shall we do with it ? 

In a country where it is impossible to keep cooked meat, 
the fact of a joint being small, need hardly be considered 
a drawback, but we have before us a good deal of bone in 
proportion to the meat, and very little fat. I say boldly 
that plainly roasting such a fragment is a mistake. 
L^nless the joint be of a fair size, and above the average as 
to fat like the saddle, or the specially fine sirloin we buy 
for a dinner party, I would never roast it. The morsel 
can ill afford to lose the little gravy it possesses which the 
stab of the spit is bound to draw, and which we rarely see 
sent to table, for Ramasamy appreciates it as an adjunct 
to his curry. 

The only way to cook little joints, such as those I have 
indicated, is to braise them. You thus obtain all the 
noui'ishment the meat can give, and a tasty and tender 
dish into the bargain. This admirable method of cookery 
is far too rarely adopted : so for the benefit of those who 
do not understand the process, I had better mention that 
hraisiiig consists in placing meat in a closed pan, with 
some made-gravy or stock round it, vegetables cut up, and 
a judicious allowance of salt and pepper. In this the 
meat is very slowly simmered, whilst it is browned exter- 
nally by live coals placed on the hraising-^^in lid. There 
is thus heat from above and below the pan, and the joint 
is cooked in its own gravy, while it derives additional 
flavoui' from the vesretables, &c., associated with it. 



ROASTING AND BRAISING. 105 

To braise a little Indian joint snccessfullv, you must 
first bone it, tlien trim it, tie it with a string into a neat 
shape, give it a dust of salt and pepper, and put it on one 
side, whilst you make the best broth you can from the 
bones you cut out, and the trimmings. This should 
occupy the cook all morning. Having obtained all you 
can from the bones, strain off your broth, let it get cool, 
skim off the fat, and now proceed to cook the meat. Melt 
some butter or fat at the bottom of your stew-pan fii'st, 
and turn the meat about in till it begins to take colour, 
then add your broth (a pint and a half or thereabouts 
for 3 fts of meat will be found enough) with two carrots, 
four good sized onions, a tea-spoonful each of marjoram 
and thyme, pepper, and salt : let it simmer gently for an 
hour. Tui'n the meat, add a couple of onions, and (says 
Gouffe) a gill of brandy, let the pan simmer for an hour 
more, — keeping live coals on the lid throughout the pro- 
cess, — and the braise will be complete. Lift out the joint, 
and keep it on a hot dish, whilst you strain off the gravy 
remaining in the stew-pan, — it vrill be half the amount you 
originally poured in, but much stronger. You can now 
send up the joint with the gravy jilainly poui^ed round it ; 
or you can pass the vegetables, with which the meat was 
braised, through the sieve, thicken thegra\'y, and add the 
pulp of the vegetables to it. 

In this manner you can successfully di^ess a leg of 
mutton, a loin of mutton, a small sirloin, a piece of the ribs 
or a fillet of beef, in fact all small joints. Larding with 
strips of fat bacon will vastly improve the braise, especially 
when the meat is very lean, and if you can make some 
strong broth from any meat and bones, or if you can spare 
a little stock from the soup-kettle, you need not bone the 
joint. The vegetables, &c., should, in this case, be boiled 
in the stock separately, wine should be added to flavour it, 
and the joint should be cooked in the mirepoix thus made. 



106 CULINARY JOTTIXGS FOR MADRAS. 

Poultry, ducks, and geese, are far better braised than 
roasted, unless you keep a fowl-yard of your own, and 
feed and kill the birds at home. To braise poultry well, 
you must make the gravy from the giblets, and trimmings 
of the birds, assisted by a little gravy-meat. In fact all 
braises are better if you help the gravy with a little extra 
meat. The French throw in a glass or two of light white 
wine when braising poultry, and Madeira or Marsala is a 
sterling aid in cooking mutton or beef in this method. A 
slice of bacon is very effective with all braised meat. 

If you must roast your little joint, see that it is not 
spitted, — that is, thrust through by the spit ; with a little 
care, a small Indian joint can easily be tied to it. Do not 
let your cook use coarse wooden skewers, but make him 
tie a joint into a shape, for every stab inflicted in it, will 
rob the piece of meat of its juiciness. 

Tastes vary so strangely as to the " doing" of meat, that 
it is impossible to give a rule for roasting. It is, however, 
essential to use an equal fire throughout the process, and 
to guard against cooking the outside too fast. Frequent 
basting is a sine qua non, and you should dredge a little 
flour over the meat to finish wdth, to produce a crisp, 
brown, frothy surface. You should preserve the fat of 
your sirloin, or loin of mutton, by tying over it a wrapper 
of buttered paper. 

The French place their small joints in marinade, a cus- 
tom I strongly advocate for the poor meat of this country, 
when you intend to roast or grill it. Here is their 
method of cooking a loin of mutton en iiapillote : — Trim 
the loin nicely, and let it lie from morning till roasting 
time 671 marinade, composed of a breakfast-cupful of salad 
oil, two onions, and a carrot, sliced fine as for Julienne, 
with some whole peppers, salt, chopped parsley, and a 



ROASTING AND BRAISING. 107 

tea-spoonful of powdered di'ied sweet herbs. Let the 
joint be turned several times during the day, and baste 
it often. When to be dressed, pack it, with its vegetables 
and all, in a well oiled paper, and roast it carefully, bast- 
ing it with the oil that composed the marinade : when 
nearly done, remove the paper, brush off the vegetables, 
baste with melted butter, and serve, when nicely browned, 
with other vegetables independently cooked, and some 
gravy. Though the inexperienced reader will hardly 
believe me, I can assure him that when finally set before 
him, he will fail to trace the presence of oil (the hete noir 
of Englishmen) whilst he will be surprised at the juici- 
ness, and good flavour of the meat. 

In roasting Indian poultry, invariably lard the breast 
with fat bacon, or tie a flap of bacon over it. Birds cannot 
be kept too moist when roasting. A large sweet onion, 
and a lump of preserved butter should be put inside the 
carcass of a fowl, and the basting should be carefully 
attended to. The slower the roasting the better. I have 
often found that a fowl baked in a slow oven till about 
three parts done, and then finished in front of the fire, was 
excellent. It should be occasionally basted with melted 
butter whilst in the oven. The bacon tied over the breast 
should be removed during the last five minutes of the cook- 
ing, when the bird should be lightly dredged over with 
flour, and liberally basted with melted butter to produce 
the brown, crisp, blisters, which always make a fowl look 
inviting. 

If permitted to follow the customs of the cookroom, the 
uneducated Ramasamy will send up your roast foAvl — 
hardly as large as an English chicken, — with its breast 
strangely puffed out and distorted with a horrible com- 
pound which he calls " stuffing." This you carefully 
avoid eating on account of its nastiness, but few, I take it, 
boldly order their cooks never to perpetrate the atrocity 



1 08 CULIXA R Y J TTIXGS FOR MA DRA S. 

again, being under an impression that stuffing is necessary 
in roasting poultry. 

Tlie only birds that should be stuffed in the crop are 
turkeys, and exceptionally fine capons. Who amongst 
you ever saw a roast fowl in England, stuffed ? The bar- 
barous practice has become common out here, and ought 
to be put down as utterly wi'ong. Moistui-e, which is so 
necessary in roasting, should, as I have already observed, 
be secui-ed by either larding the fowl with fat bacon, or 
tying a slice of -bacon over the breast. I however advo- 
cate a stuffing for the inside of a fowl intended for braising 
as follows : — well mashed potato, and boiled sweet onion, 
in the proportion of two-thirds of the former to one-third 
of the latter. The mashed potato, of course, contains 
butter, spiced pepper, a little milk or cream, or the yolk 
of an Qgg, and helps to preserve the juiciness of the bird ; 
the flavour it imparts too is, I think, agreeable. This 
with a little chopped sage may be used for ducks. 

An autlior for whom I entertain the greatest respect 
urges the practice I have mentioned of putting one sweet 
onion, and a lump of salt butter, inside every chicken, or 
fowl, to be roasted. But this cannot be called " stuffing." 
A turkey, on the other hand, requires carefully made 
forcemeat, and, as you all know, there are many varieties 
thereof. Truffles, and chestnuts form the epicurean stuff- 
ing of the roast turkey, and one of oysters is propounded 
for the boiled bird. I leave these elaborate compositions 
alone, for receipts can be easily hunted up for them when 
a special occasion may demand a " dindon frufe a la Peri- 
gord,'' or a " dinde hraisee a la financiers,'' ^r., ^x. The 
stuffing, I am anxious to discuss, is the ordinary one we 
remember in England for turkeys, veal, hares, and so 
on : — a firm, green-tinted forcemeat, flavoured with pleasant 
herbs, and a suspicion of lemon-peel ; a forcemeat which 
cuts clean with the slice of the breast of your turkey, or 



ROASTING AND BRAISING, 109 

fillet of veal, and is nice whether hot or cold. Not a 
greasy mess, pale brown in colour, and lumpy, which, 
at the first cut of the kaife, oozes out, and encumbers the 
dish in a most untempting manner. 

In order to be sure of making the real thing, if you 
have not (as you ought to have easily enough at Madras) 
the plants themselves growing in pots handy, see that you 
have a bottle of dried thyme, and one of marjoram, and a 
good bunch of fresh curly parsley, which should also be 
growing in boxes. Having these ready, work as follows : — 
Pare a good sized lime as finely as possible avoiding the 
slightest particle of white pith, and mince the peel as 
small as possible : weigh six ounces of dry, well sifted, 
stale bread-crumbs : measure a dessert-spoonful of chopped 
thyme (green) and one of marjoram (green), or take a 
table-spoonful of the di^ied leaves powdered — half and half : 
you must powder the leaves to get rid of atoms of stalk and 
stick : mince the parsley fine to the extent of a heaped up 
table-spoonful : chop up three ounces of fresh beef-suet, 
or butter if suet cannot be got : mix all these together 
with two spoons in a large dish, and dust the whole well 
with salt and pepper, lastly, binding the mixtiu^e with 
three well-beaten eggs : work this together, and the 
stuffing will be fit to use. Much depends upon the fine 
mincing of all the ingredients, and their thorough in- 
corporation : the suet should be chopped as finely as 
possible. The colour will be, of course, a deep green 
provided you use the quantities of green herbs I have 
given : supposing, however, that you have only di^ied herbs, 
and that you cannot get fresh parsley ; why not secure the 
colour by a good spoonful of spinach-greening, it is almost 
tasteless, and the colour is a great thing in stuffing. This, 
carefully made, is Martha's ordinary veal, or turkey stuff- 
ing, and ought to taste, just as nice here as that which we 
so well remember at home. 

10 



110 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 



In mincing parsley, and all green herbs, be careful that, 
after washing them well, the leaves are ivell dried in a 
cloth : if chopped wet, the juice escapes, and the mince is 
never finely and evenly granulated. 

Forcemeats are, of course, added to, and perhaps im- 
proved, by chopped ham, tongue, liver, mushrooms, bacon, 
a little anchovy, a casual oyster, and, of course, truffles. 
The addition of these things should, however, be thought- 
fully carried out, and the proportions on no account left at 
haphazard to the tender mercy of the average Ramasamy. 

The mixture which tradition has handed down to the 
Anglo-Indian kitchen for the stuffing of ducks and geese 
is nearly as disagreeable as that for the fowl. Whilst the 
latter may be described as a consolidated and greasy rela- 
tion of the " bread poultice" that I denounced, when treat- 
ing of " bread sauce," the former owes its flavour to violent 
onion, crude sage, and slices of half-boiled potato, mixed 
together lumpily and lubricated with some chopped fat. 
Let me speedily tell you that potnto has no place whatever 
in the best duck stuffing, and that the crude taste j^ou 
dislike so much arises from the sage being chopped raw, 
and the onion being a common one instead of the mild 
kind called " Bombay," or " Bellary." 

Duck stuffing should be made in this manner : — Take 
three Bombay onions the size of Badminton balls, wash, 
peel, and boil them in two waters to extract the acrid 
flavour. Whilst these are boiling, take eight tender look- 
ing sage leaves, and scald them in boiling water for five 
minutes, take them out, and when the onions are tender, 
turn them out, drain them dry, and proceed to mince them 
with the sage leaves, very fine. Add to this, five ounces of 
bread-crumbs, and dust over the mixture a liberal allow- 
ance of spiced pepper (which I give later on) and salt : 
when nicely worked together, add an ounce of butter or 



ROASTING AND BRAISING. Ill 

suet cut into dice and bind tlie ingredients with three 
eggs, it will now be ready for use. The proportions of 
this stuffing may be relied on : it is mild, yet pleasantly 
flavoured, and, " leaves not a trace of sad memory behind." 

Goose stuffing is made in a similar way, and the com- 
position is a pleasant addition to some joints of pork : let 
my friends on the Hills try a loin, boned, rolled, and stuffed 
with this, and roasted over a bright fire. 

In all stuffings, and forcemeats, whether required for 
roast, boiled, or braised poultry ; for the dainty galantine 
or the savoury pie, there are few things more useful to 
have at hand than " 5j92ce(^ _p6?ppe?"." It saves an infinity 
of trouble, and is an invaluable thing for a thousand 
dishes. I have been very successful with one that I con- 
cocted from Gonffe's receipt, which I feel it my duty to 
tell you of, and urge you to go and do likewise. You 
can bottle it, and take what you require from time to time.

pound the above ingredients thoroughly in a mortar, and 
when ground to powder, pass it through a fine sieve : 
bottle it, and cork it down securely. 

If you desire to make what Gouffe calls " spiced salt," 
mix one ounce of the above with four of salt. Spiced 
pepper is constantly wanted, and lends that nice sausage 
flavour to savoury pies, rolled beef, brawn, savoury pcUes, 
and all forcemeats. 

Amongst the many barbarous tricks of Native cooks, 



112 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

there is an especial one which I ought to have brought to 
prominent notice before. I refer to the method which 
obtains in the cookroom of removing the feathers from 
poultry, geese, ducks, and game. I cannot call it " pluck- 
ing," for, as many of you know, the feathers are got rid 
of wholesale by plunging the bird into scalding hot-water ! 
The immediate effect of this ignorant habit is to harden 
and parch the skin of the fowl, to prevent the proper 
exudation and admission of moisture during roasting, and 
to render the flesh dry and tasteless. Birds must be 
plucked by hand, and their small down must be singed. 
To ensure this being done in your kitchen, order all birds 
to be brought for inspection when trussed for cooking, and 
the smallest experience will enable you to detect the 
parchment-like skin of the scalded bird, from that of the 
hand-plucked one, which will be cool and soft, with an 
unmistakable freshness which the other cannot have. A 
basket containing the feathers should also be shown, for 
they will expose scalding in a minute. It is needless to 
say that game is ruthlessly spoiled by this trick of the 
kitchen, and even the chicken destined for a curry is 
robbed of half its flavour by being scalded first. The 
practice is, of course, the offspring of idleness, — a sub- 
terfuge to escape trouble. 

I would also point out that the common way of killing 
poultry in this country is inhuman, and, in a culinary 
point of view, utterly wrong. Setting aside the cruelty of 
cutting a fowl's throat, and throwing it on the ground to 
bleed to death in agony, what an idiotic thing it is to 
waste the very part of the bird from which its gravy, and 
juiciness are derived ! White meats are bled in England 
simply to produce the necessary tint, but they lose much 
of their nutritious quality by the process. They, how- 
ever, can afford to do so. Our poorly flavoured birds can 
ill endure the loss of an atom of the richness that they

may possess. I maintain, therefore, that a merciful, and 
instantaneous death, by a heavy blow from a wooden 
mallet, would be pleasanter for the fowl, and far better 
for us : — the blow should be given on the back of the 
head. 

Besides those I have mentioned there are still two evil 
practices to be noted to which ^N'ative cooks are prone. 
The first, is that of parboiling joints and poultry before 
roasting them: the second, is that of keeping joints, &c., 
far too long on the spit. As a rule, Ramasamy commences 
operations much too soon, and then keeps the meat on 
the spit before a low fire until it is wanted. Strict orders 
should be issued to prevent the first of these errors, and a 
table, showing the time that various joints require in 
roasting properly, should be hung up in the kitchen to 
prevent the second. 

If the spit be protected from draughts with a screen, 
and the fire evenly maintained, and sufficiently brisk for 
the operation in hand —

Boiling and Steaming. 

I OILING," says the G. C, " is one of the simplest 
and most economical modes of preparing food. 
Meat loses less weight in boiling than in any 
process of cooking, and the water it has been boiled in can 
always be turned to good account ; besides which, although 
it may be an open question whether boiled meat is more 
nutritious than roast or boiled meat, it is beyond dispute 
more wholesome and easily digested," 

Under the head of " soup-making" I have already dis- 
cussed the method of boiling meat required for soup : the 
^^ pof-au-feii" being my example of how meat should be 
treated when the object is to extract its juices. We must 
now consider what has to be done in preparing boiled 
meat for the table, and note where the two processes differ. 

For the ^^ pot-au-feu' it is necessary to put the meat and 
salt into cold water first, — alone : to watch it come slowly 
to the boil, skimming the scum that rises very carefully : 
when the sm'f ace is clear, and the water boiling, to add the 
vegetables, &c. ; to let it boil till the vegetables are done, 
to remove them, and then to let the contents of your pot 
simmer for three or foui' hours. But for a piece of boiled 
beef, a fowl, leg of mutton, or whatever it may be, destined 
for the dinner table, you must put the meat, tied neatly 
in the shape required with twdne, into hot water to begin 



BOILING AND STEAMING. 115 

with. Like the pot-au-feu it should be watched, and skim- 
med, and the salt, and flavonring vegetables, and herbs, 
added when the scum has been removed. The water, let 
me observe, must not be hoiling, it should be as hot as you 
can bear to touch, and the early stage of coming to the 
actual boil should be retarded as much as possible. 

Boiled meat at the English dinner table is often spoiled 
by being " galloped," as cooks say, that is, done too fast. 
Meat thus maltreated cannot fail to be tough. You must 
simmer your hump, or youi' ham, just as carefully as you 
would the meat of a pot-au-feu. When once boiling-point 
has been attained, ease off the fire a little, and endeavour 
to obtain a uniform heat below the pot that will just keep 
its surface, as it were, alive. An occasional bubble, is 
what you want, with gentle motion, the water muttering 
to you, not jabbering and fussing, as it does when boiling. 
If you follow this process, you will never have to send a 
boiled leg of mutton away fi'om the table because of its 
being too underdone inside to be fit to eat. 

Remember that the liquor in which a joint has been 
boiled is weak stock. If reduced by being simmered with 
the lid of the cooking vessel removed, it can be turned to 
account in many ways, especially for the enrichment of 
white sauce. 

The common error made by cooks in England, just as 
much as by our Ramasamy, consists in their keeping up 
the high pressure too long, whereby the outside of the 
joint is rapidly done, and the inside scarcely cooked at all. 
The joint looks done, and is consequently sent up with 
the unsatisfactory result which I have pointed out. 

Simmering a joint of meat is undoubtedly a troublesome 
process in India. The cook's attention must be kept up 
throughout the work. He cannot lift the pot to the hob, 
or change its position on the range, as the English cook 



116 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

can so easily do. He must be ever watchful about his 
fire, and guard against there being too much, or too little 
firewood under his vessels. In fact, I doubt whether it 
is possible for Ramasamj to conduct the simmering pro- 
cess satisfactorily with only the common appliances of the 
cookroom at his command. Those who possess ranges, or 
cooking stoves, should count themselves especially for- 
tunate. Their cooks can regulate the heat they want 
at will. But, with a common cookroom fireplace, the 
difficulty of maintaining the unvar3'ing gentle heat so 
highly essential, appears to me to be very great. 

During the boiling of a joint, the water should, at all 
times, be kept so as to cover it. If there be any loss by 
evaporation, it should be made good at once by the addi- 
tion of hot water. 

No matter what kind of meat you boil, you will find it 
improved by the addition of a few vegetables. Custom 
has ruled that we should put in carrots, and turnips, witli 
boiled beef ; turnips, or sweet onions, with boiled mutton ; 
onions with a rabbit, &c., yet true cooks add a judicious 
assortment of herbs, <tc., to every boiled dish. A large 
sweet onion, some celery, a carrot, parsley, a sprig of mar- 
joram, or thyme, a little bag of flavouring materials such 
as a clove of garlic, a blade of mace, a few cloves, some 
whole peppers, and the peel of a lime, should always go 
into the pot with a boiling fowl. Unless you have tried 
them, you have no idea how these things improve the taste 
of boiled joints. 

It is a very capital plan to hoil a foicl in the soup-stocJi'. 
Herein you have the true essence of economy — no waste. 
The soup gains all the fowl loses in the boiling, whilst the 
fowl derives richness and flavour by being done in the 
stock. One lot of vegetables and herbs suflices for both, 
and absolutely nothing is thrown away but the muslin bag 



BOILING AND STEAMING. 117 

which contained the spices, garlic, &c.* I need hardly 
remind you that in suggesting this to RamasamY you will 
meet with opposition. He will tell you, in all probability, 
that " mixted the fowl and soup-meat, cannot come the 
good taste," and when you insist upon a trial, he will go 
away sorrowful, for the broth produced in boiling a fowl 
in the ordinary way, is his perquisite (or rather we do not 
ask for it) and " mixted with rice only," makes, with a 
chilli or two, a bowl of " pish-pash." Xevertheless, the 
fact exists beyond a doubt that a fowl is vastly improved 
by being thus cooked : it remains for you to decide whe- 
ther, as a matter of policy, it would be wise to vex " your 
best friend" by ordering so great an innovation. I 
confess that the man who, with his eyes open, wars 
against his chef, is generally the loser before the campaign 
is ended. 

Time in boiling meat can scarcely be fixed arbitrarily. 
If you follow the advice I have given, you will find fifteen 
to twenty minutes per pound a reliable allowance. Dis- 
cretion and experience will enable you to decide what 
orders to give. Large and deep joints such as humps, legs 
of mutton and of pork, silverside of beef, and hams, will 
naturally require a more liberal allowance than fowls, 
tongues, galantines, bacon, rabbits, &c. 

There are few things that are boiled as important as the 
ham. So much depends on the cook's knowledge of the 
process, that many a ham is spoiled through ignorance. 
I think it advisable, therefore, to give you the following- 
rules which I hope will be found easy enough : 

It is of course a sine qua non that you soak the ham for 
twenty -four hours, changing the water at least three times 
(I am speaking of hams in canvas, or skin, not of those in 

* Tlie fowl should not be put into the soup-kettle until all skim- 
ming has been completed, and the soup brought to the boil. — W. 



118 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

tins) ; when thus well soaked, scrub the ham well, and 
trim it, scraping off all discolorations. Now, place it in 
your ham-kettle, and cover it with cold water (for a 
festival a bottle of Madeira or Marsala should be poured 
in with the water) and let it come gently to the boil, 
removing all scum that may rise. When quite clear, 
throw in three carrots, a head of celery cut up (leaves 
and all), three Bombay onions, a bag containing a clove 
of garlic, a dozen whole peppers, and some pieces of lime 
peel, with bunches of parsley, thyme, and marjoram : boil 
on till the vegetables are done, and then let the kettle 
simmer gently for four or five hours. When done, let 
it remain till nearly cold, then lift the ham from the 
water, and detach the outer skin (it will roll off easily) 
and dredge some fine crust raspings, or some pounded 
baked crumbs over it. 

An ancient Indian custom may still be met with, where 
civilization has not yet penetrated, of sticking an army of 
cloves into the skin of a ham. Fine your cook a rupee for 
this desecration and it will not occur again. The ham 
should either be dredged over as I have described, or, if 
wanted for a ball supper, wedding breakfast, luncheon 
party, or grand picnic, it should be glazed, a recipe for 
which process will be found elsewhere. 

Old cookery books give you the funniest nostrums con- 
cerning the cookery of a ham. Wisps of hay, juniper 
berries, coriander seed, ale, and even leather shavings, are 
laid down as flavouring adjuncts. Saltpetre is advised to 
add to the redness, and in England you find local prejudices 
in favour of the addition of different wines : in one county 
elder-wine, in another cowslip-wine, and so on. The end 
of all things, after all, is to get a really well-cured ham, if 
you secure tliat, and cook it as I have described, you will 
not require any leather shavings, but remember that on 



BOILING AND STEAMING. 119 

important occasions a bottle of Madeira or Marsala crowns 
your best efforts with supreme success. 

Some of the best modern writers on cookery urge us 
to give up the salting of beef for boiling. " Such a prac- 
tice," says one of them, "cannot be too strongly condemn- 
ed ; for whilst it impairs the wholesomeness of the meat, 
and makes it less digestible, it considerably diminishes 
the nutritive properties of it, and, boil it as you will, a 
piece of salt-beef is never so tender as a piece of fresh 
beef." We, Anglo-Indians, can scarcely bring ourselves to 
accept this advice in its entirety ; our hump being in itself 
specinlite worthy of admiration in any land. Neither will 
Englishmen ever be prevailed upon to deny themselves 
those delicious slices of cold boiled salted silverside, with 
which they are wont to regale themselves at breakfast, 
and at luncheon at home. Nevertheless, small pieces of 
beef, boiled fresh with vegetables are very acceptable. I 
do not, for instance, think that an ordinary Indian brisket 
is worth salting ; it generally comes to table hard, and 
dry, not having sufficient depth of flesh. Boiled fresh, 
with the allowance of vegetables I have mentioned, this 
joint will be found nice enough, and if laid upon a bed of 
previously boiled maccaroni, and smothered in bright 
tomato sauce, you might indeed go further and fare worse. 
I fully agree with the old rhyme : — 

" a turkey boiled is turkey spoiled," 
and I cannot understand any one maltreating that noble 
bird so cruelly. A funny idea exists I know (one handed 
down from gTand-mama) that if you give roast mutton or 
beef at a dinner party, the fowls or turkey must be hoiled ! 
What absurd nonsense. You offer your guests the choice 
of white or hroivn meat, each dressed in its most tempting 
form, you do not bind yourself to give them roast, or 
boiled. If the white meat be equally nice boiled, like 
fowls, a leg of pork, a knuckle of veal, &c., you may, of 



120 CULIXARV 70TT/XGS FOR MADRAS. 

course, so serve it, but do not run away with the erroneous 
notion that von vnist boil (and so spoil) your turkey 
because youi' other joint happen to be a saddle, or a sirloin. 

The process of ?teamix<; has become familiar to many 
people in India on account of the introduction of Warren s 
cooking-pot, and vegetable sfeajuer. I have been told that 
during the recent campaign in Afghanistan, this utensil 
was found invaluable, and I can well believe it. 

The term " steaming" is frequently api)lied not only to 
the Warren process, but also to the cooking of meat and 
vegetables placed in hermetically closing utensils, which, 
in turn, are plunged into larger vessels filled with boiling 
water. 

Warren's system needs no description for detailed in- 
structions accompany every vessel. Its chief recommen- 
dation consists in its simplicity and economy. Meat well 
braised may be said to be equally nutritious, for it is in 
like manner cooked in its own vapour and juices ; but in 
the matter of fuel braising is by far the more expensive 
method, while the careful regulation of the heat, &c., costs 
infinitelv more trouble than the simple boiling of a War- 
ren's pot. The one process requires the hand of a chef: 
the other can be managed by any one. 

The not uncommon practice of partly roasting a joint 
after it has been nearly cooked in a Warren's pot is erro- 
neous. The result can at best be that of meat half -boiled, 
half-roasted, — " neither fish, nor fowl, nor good red her- 
ring," so to speak. A good cook ought, by the clever 
treatment of the gravy made by the meat, to be able to 
diversify both the appearance and flavour of the joint, 
adding to its attractiveness by a tasteful garnish of mac- 
caroni or vegetables. 

The utmost cleanliness is absolutely necessary in the 
use of Warren's pot. 



BOILING AND STEAMING. 121 

Somewhat similar in treatment is tlie process of Jugging. 
There is, I think, a dish called by Ramasamy '' hoil-ed 
chdfs" (boiled chops), cooked in this manner, which is 
familiar to everj one in this part of India, and really 
deserving of attention, for it is susceptible of improYement, 
and far greater development. A nice steak ; a dish of 
neck cutlets ; the blade bone of the shoulder, boned and 
flattened ; a tender fovrl, boned and flattened ; game simi- 
larly prepared, and even fish, can thus be dressed very 
daintily. 

I advocate the making of a vessel specially for " jugged"' 
dishes, as follows : — An oval tin, ten inches long, and 
seven and a half inches across ; one inch and three- 
quarters deep. The tin should have its upper edge tiu'ned 
outwards like a pie-dish, half an inch wide, so that a flat 
cover may be pasted closely to it, and it should have a 
ring at each end to serve for handles. The cover should 
be an oval sheet of tin slightly larger in its measurements 
than the interior of the tin itself. A vessel of this kind 
I can strongly recommend. I have found mine invaluable. 

Let us first take Ramasamy's " boiled chad's.''' — Choose 
a good neck of mutton, and trim the little chops as neatly 
as possible. With the trimmings of meat and bone make 
a broth, assisted by an onion, some pepper corns, any 
scraps of beef, chicken bones, cold game, lean ham or 
bacon, in short any useful sundries. When done, skim, 
and strain it, you ought to have a breakfast-cupful of it. 
Xow, scald the tin and cool it in cold water, cover the 
bottom of the tin with slices of onion, and arrange the 
chops thereon, covering them with two Bombay onions 
Bliced fine, a carrot sliced, a young turnip sliced, a stick 
of celery cut into half inch lengths, two tomatoes sliced 
and drained, and a bunch of curled parsley. Then add 
to the broth a liquetu' glass of hrandij, a table-spoonful of 

11 



122 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

mushroom ketchup, a salt-spoonful of salt, and the same of 
sugar. Pepper the chops pretty freely with black pepper 
before covering them. When arranged, pour in the broth, 
and seal the lid of the tin, all round the rim, with stiff 
paste, fixing it secui*ely. Now, put the tin into boiling 
water, and keep it on the fire for two hours. At the time 
of serving, the lid should be cut off, and the tin, wrapped 
in a napkin, should be placed upon an ordinary dish, and 
sent to table immediately. 

Follow the same directions in "jugging" a steak, or a 
blade bone : in the case of the boned fowl, a little bacon, 
or some sliced bologna sausage, will be found an improve- 
ment, the broth being made, of course, from the bones 
and giblets. With game birds I would add a little sweet 
herb seasoning. 

Fish should be done in this way : — Trim the fish in 
fillets, season them with pepper and salt, cover the bottom 
of the tin with slices of Bombay onion, dotting in a dozen 
pepper corns, and two cloves ; put a layer of fillets over 
the onion, and pepper them with black pepper ; put in now 
a layer of sliced tomatoes, sprinkle some roughly-chopped 
curled parsley over them, and a table-spoonful of chopped 
capsicums ; pour in a little broth made from the fish bones 
and trimmings, with a glass of chablis, sauterne, or hock, 
cover the tin closely, and boil. A clove of garlic may be 
introduced in this dish by those who appreciate the faint- 
est suspicion of that fragrant bulb, and the fine rind of a 
lime also. 

If made of two or three sorts of little fishes, with a 
pinch of saffron, and, instead of the broth, a libation com- 
posed of one table-spoonful of salad oil, two table-spoonfuls 
of chablis, and three of water, the effect will be pleasing 
to those who have eaten, and enjoyed a houillahaisse, for 
the broth produced by the fish and ingredients I have 
named is not unlike that excellent composition.

BOILING AND STEAMING. 123 

In my last chapter I dwelt upon the invaluable culinary 
process known as braising, and tried to point out the 
special adaptability of that method of cookery to the treat- 
ment of the small and often indifferently fed meat of this 
country. I did not however allude to a simpler yet scarcely 
less noteworthy kind of braise by which is produced that 
very excellent dish called bceuf 'a la mode : There is per- 
haps no name in the French vocabulary de cuisine more 
frequently " taken irf vain" by English cooks, as well as 
by poor Ramasamy, than this. As a rule they apply the 
term to a joint of cold roast beef when warmed up en 
recliauffe, and sent to table smothered with a thick sance 
browned with burnt onion, and surrounded by sodden 
vegetables ! l^ow, hoetif a la mode is very far from being 
a rechauffe. On the contrary, it is a carefully selected 
piece of fresh meat scientifically stewed with vegetables. 
Its rich, self-made gravy is not thickened, and its garnish 
should be composed of vegetables separately trimmed and 
cooked for that purpose. 

!N"o better recipe can possibly be found than that given 
by Gouffe quoted by Sir Henry Thompson as follows : — 

" Take about 4 lbs. (2 hilos) of thick beefsteak cut 
square. Take nearly f lb. (3 hectos) of raw fat bacon, cut 
off the rind, which should be put aside to blanche, and then 
cut the bacon in strips for larding, about one-third of an 
inch thick, and sprinkle them with pepper. Lard the 
meat, and tie it up as for the pot-au-feu. Place the piece 
of meat in a stew-pan with rather less than a pint of 
white wine, a wine-glass of brandy, a pint of stock, a pint 
of water, two calves' feet already boned and blanched, and 
the rind of the bacon also blanched. Put it on the fire 
adding a little less than one ounce of salt (30 grammes). 
Make it boil, and skim it as for pot-au-feu ; next, having 
skimmed it, add fully one pound (500 grammes) of carrots, 



^24 CULINARY JOTTIXGS FOR MADRAS. 

one onion, three cloves, one faggot of herbs, and two 
pinches of pepper. Place the stew-pan on the corner of 
the stove, cover it, and allow it to simmer veiy gently for 
four hours and a half. Tiy the meat with a skewer to 
ascertain when it is sufficiently cooked, then put it on a 
dish with the carrots and the calves' feet, and keep them 
covered up hot until serving." 

" Next, strain the gravy tlirough a fine tammy ; remove 
carefully eveiy atom of grease, and reduce it over the fire 
about a quarter. Lastly, untie the beef, place it on the 
dish for serving, add the calves' feet each having been 
cut into eight pieces, the cari'ots cut into pieces the size 
of corks, and ten glazed onions. Ai'range the calves' feet, 
the cari'ots, and onions round the beef, pour the sauce over 
the meat keeping the surplus for the next day. Taste it 
in order to ascertain if sufficiently seasoned. Beef a la 
mode should be very relishing : sometimes a clove of garlic 
is added. I do not mention this as a necessary item, 
but as one which must be decided by the lady of the 
house." 

Those who desire to enjoy the true hceiif a la mode will 
do well to follow this recipe in its entirety. Observe that 
the piece of meat should be cut en bloc from the rumj) 
steak and have no bone. The white wine may be chahlis, 
santerne, graves, or hock. The remains of a good bottle of 
champagne left the night before — ' still,' yet perfectly 
sound — would be admirable. Four sheep's feet may be 
used instead of the calves'. The boiling should, in the 
first instance, be retarded (as in the case of the pot-aii-fen) 
by the addition from time to time of a little cold water. 
This will cause the scum to rise, all of which should be 
taken off before the addition of the vegetables. I would 
always put in a leek if I could get one, and some pieces of 
celery also. Please note that the gravy should be boiled 



BOILING AND STEAMING. 125 

down a little to add to its strength, but not tliickened with 
butter and flour. 

Larger pieces of beef can be cooked in this manner, in- 
gi'edients in proportion to the extra weight being added. 
Indeed Gouffe says : — " I advise in regard of all braised 
meats, whether beef or veal, that the portions should be 
rather too large than too small ; a long process of cooking 
succeeds always better with such than with tiny portions. 
A second excellent dish can always be made, cold, with 
the addition of jelly. It appears to me better then, to 
eat twice following of a good dish thus varied, than to 
cook the small quantity which suffices only for one meal." 
This advice can be followed with advantage during the 
cold season, and at our Hill stations.

Our Vegetables, 



^^TRITICS of English cookery seem to agree m saymg 
^^^^ that, wanting as we are, as a rule, in our general 
knowledge of kitchen work, our ignorance of the 
ti'eatment of vegetables is greater than in every other 
branch of the art. Until comparatively lately, the uni- 
versal method of serving vegetables at an English dinner 
table was with the joint alone. Dressed vegetables, or 
entremets de legumes^ wei*e never heaixi of. Of late years, 
however, facilities in the way of travelling abroad have 
been great, and by degrees the Briton has come to appre- 
ciate a dish of vegetables, specially prepared, such as he 
liked so much in Paris, at Dieppe, Nice, Monaco, or Pau ; 
and Martha has been " worritted," on the return of the 
family to England, to " mess about the cauliflower with 
cheese," or send up the green peas in solitary grandeur. 
A fillip has, in this way, been given to vegetable cookery 
in England, and peojDle with any claims to refined taste 
have at last come to perceive the absolute barbarism of 
heaping up two or three sorts of vegetables on the same 
plate with roast meat and gravy. 

From time immemorial tinned asparagus, — served alone, 
has occupied a prominent place in the menu of a dinner in 
India. I have often wondered how this spark of civiJiza- 



OUR VEGETABLES. 12 7 

tion became kindled, and why the example thus given was 
never more generally followed with regard to other vege- 
tables. 

It will be, I think, admitted nem con that we live in a 
climate out here especially demanding vegetable diet. 
With the thermometer indicating 90 ° or thereabouts, plain 
animal food is not only distasteful to many, but absolutely 
unwholesome. We cannot, therefore, devote too much 
attention to the cookery of vegetables. 

Let us consider what we have got under three heads : — 

(a) — English vegetables grown in India. 

(h) — Country vegetables. 

(c) — Vegetables preserved in tins. 

At different periods during the year we can get in 
Madras : — potatoes, green peas, cauliflowers, cabbages, 
spinach, artichokes (Jerusalem), and globe artichokes 
from the Hills, French beans, carrots, parsnips, turnips, 
knolkhol, celery, marrows, leeks, cucumbers, tomatoes, 
lettuces, beetroot, endive, and onions : all under head 
number one. 

Under head number two we have, brinjals, bandecai, 
various beans, country cucumber, and gTeens (which cook 
well as spinach), moringa pods, small tomato or love apple, 
maize, {mucha cJioliim) sorrel, pumpkin, yams, onions large 
and small, garlic, and sweet potato. 

For head number three, which we will take separately, 
we must consult the list of preserved French, and American 
vegetables published by any well-known Firm. 

I have omitted asparagus, seakale, and salsify, from my 
list under the first head, as those excellent vegetables have 
not yet been cultivated by the gardeners of Bangalore or 
the Neilgherries in sufficient quantity to form a portion of 
the vegetable supply of our markets. For the benefit

however, of such enterprising amateurs as may be able to 
grow them privately, I will mention how each should be 
treated by the cook hereafter. 

Potatoes perhaps claim the most important place in our 
consideration, so let us take them first. 

The boiling of a potato has long been considered one of 
the tests by which the merits of a cook should be decided. 
•' Can she cook a chop, and boil a potato ?" is often the 
modest query of pater f ami lias in England, and in nine 
cases out of ten you may wager your best hat that she can 
do neither. Nevertheless, I have come to the conclusion 
that cooks are in many cases wrongfully blamed in the 
matter of potato-cooking, that is to say, that their failure 
is often attributed to the wrong cause. We all know that 
the potato grows capriciously according to the weather i< 
may have enjoyed, or have suffered from. A crop will 
sometimes prove mealy, and light, for the table, and at 
other times waxy, and heavy. It is therefore obvious that 
we should find out the merits or demerits of the tubers we 
buy, before we give oui' orders regarding their treatment 
in the kitchen. We ought not to expect all potatoes to 
turn out equally floury as a matter of course, and blame 
the cook if he fail so to serve them. 

There are fortunately so many ways of cooking potatoes 
that we need never be at a loss for a recipe. If nice and 
mealy we can, of course, boil, or steam them, — the latter 
method for choice, — and serve them plainly : but if waxy, 
we must proceed differently. 

Whether boiled, or steamed, a potato ought not to be 
peeled ; if it be very old, you cannot avoid removing the 
akin and eyes, but, in a general way, a potato is far better 
cooked " in its jacket." When done, the skin can be 
removed, if you wish, in the kitchen, and the dish bo

served plain, or in any one of the ways I shall presently 
speak of. 

The '• Gr. C," says : — " After they have been carefully 
washed, put your potatoes, unpeeled, into a sauce-pan, 
filled with cold-water to the height of about an inch, then 
sprinkle them with salt, and place a wet cloth on the top 
of them. The sauce-pan should be then put on the fire, 
and in about half an hour, drawn upon the kitchener (at 
the side of the fire) to remain hot till the potatoes are 
wanted." 

Choose potatoes as much of a size as you can for boiling : 
do not boil a large and two small ones together if you can 
help it. "When jDotatoes are boiled in the ordinary fashion ; 
that is, placed in a sauce-pan with a due allowance of salt, 
and covered well with cold water, they should be lifted, 
and drained after half an hour's cooking, and then be 
returned to the hot, empty sauce-pan, covered with a wet 
cloth, and placed at the margin of the fire to keep hot, and 
to dry themselves thoroughly. 

In boiling potatoes in the ordinary method, it is a good 
thing to check the rate of cooking, every now and then, by 
adding a little cold water, and the time ought to be, — after 
boiling commences, — from eighteen to twenty minutes. 

'• Steamed potatoes" should be scraped, picked, and 
wiped, after having been set for five minutes or so in cold- 
water. Then place them in the steamer over boiling 
water, and let them steam till done : the time may vary 
from twenty to forty minutes : the fork (or a skewer) 
should go through them easily, if not, they are not done 
A minute in a fast oven will dry them if needful. 

New potatoes should be scrubbed, rubbed with a coarse 
cloth, and boiled or steamed according to taste : you cannot 
expect them to be very mealy, of course, and with some 
people their waxiness constitutes their chief charm. 



130 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

Having boiled or steamed our potato satisfactorily, let 
us see in how many ways we may serye it, presuming that 
we have turned it out as flourily as we could desire. 

First, of course, it may be sent up plainly, either in its 
skin, or crumbled in to the dish made hot to receive it. 
Secondly, it may be turned out upon a wire sieve, be 
nibbed through it with a wooden spoon, and dished plainly 
in that form as " potato-snow" ponunes de terre rapees. 
Lastly, it may be mashed, and I maintain that true mashed 
potato can only be produced from a mealy tuber. A good 
way to mash potatoes is to break them up first in the dry 
hot sauce-pan in which they were boiled, working them 
well with a wooden spoon, and adding as much butter as 
you can spare, a little milk, and some salt. When fairly 
well mashed, to pass them through the sieve so as to catch 
the knots, and then to form them as you like, — browning 
the mould in front of the fire, or in the oven before serving. 

If you want to get i}is.t for eigji taste, which many people 
fancy in mashed potatoes, try the following method : — 
when your potatoes are nicely boiled, and drained, turn 
them back into their sauce-pan, which, during the drain- 
ing, you must ruh lightly with garlic : go on as previously 
described, be liberal with your butter, and instead of the 
milk, add a little stock from the soup kettle. A dust of 
pepper, and a little nutmeg, will complete the puree, for 
remember that mashed potato abroad goes by the name of 
puree de pommes de terre, and is sent to table not nearly as 
stiffly moulded as ours. 

Mashed potato brings as to more elaborate forms of potato 
cookery, viz. : — a la Duchesse, croquettes, ^'c. 

Potatoes a la Duchesse should be well worked through 
the sieve, enriched with the yolks of two or three eggs, 
and a gill of cream, and given a delicate flavouring of salt, 
pepper, nutmeg, and chopped parsley : then rolled into 



OUR VEGETABLES. 131 

balls, and either fried gently in butter, or broomed in tlie 
oven on a buttered tin, having been previonfily brushed 
over with egg, and bread crumbed with very fine stale 
crumbs. 

'A la " Gr. C." — A Bombay onion, boiled yery soft, should 
be beaten, hot, with four times its bulk of potato ; butter, 
cream, pepper, the yolks of two eggs, and salt should be 
added, and the whole passed through the sieve : roll this 
mixture into balls, and treat them as laid down for the 
Vuchesse. 

Boulettes de jpommes de terre are very tasty : — Mash eight 
fairly-sized potatoes, pass the puree through the sieve, 
work into it the yolks of five eggs ; season it with a little 
finely-minced parsley and marjoram ; moisten it with 
enough cream to bring it to the consistency of thin paste ; 
add salt, pepper, and a dust of nutmeg ; lastly, add the 
whites of three of the eggs whipped to a stiff froth. Pre- 
pare a bath of boiling fat, and then fry the boulettes by 
passing tea-spoonfuls of the paste one after the other into 
the fat. As each little spoonful reaches the fat, it will 
swell up, and as soon as it tuims a rich golden yellow, it 
is done. These can only be successful when the potato is 
dry, and floury. 

Croquettes can be made of cold mashed potatoes left from 
a previous meal. You must work them very much as pre- 
viously described, flavouring them with a little chopped 
parsley, a very little shallot, a little chopped thyme or mar- 
joram, or spices if you like : form them into rolls or tablets, 
and fry them a golden brown. The art of the cook will be 
made manifest by his presenting you with a tasty-looking 
morsel, of the right colour, and delicately flavoured. 
Change can, of course, be obtained by selecting herbs, <tc., 
according to your pleasure. 

In frying croquettes, duchesses, Sf'c, it is a sine qua )ion to 



132 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

nse plenty of fat. and to see that it is boiling. If the fry- 
ing medium be not hot enough, and insufficient in quantity, 
you will never get the golden colour which perfection 
demands. 

Waxy potatoes, with the exception previously men- 
tioned of new ones, should never be served plainly boiled : 
you should direct them to be cooked in one of the follow- 
ing ways : — a la maitre d' hotel, a la Lyonnaise, saufees, a 
VAviericaine, <5'c. 

Potatoes sautees (not to be confounded please with 
potatoes f rites) should be treated in this manner : — Boil 
your potatoes, then slice them moderately thickly, and 
toss them in plenty of butter in your frying-pan till they 
colour nicely, pour the brown butter over them, and give 
them a dust of salt. 

For maitre d'hStel proceed as above, adding a few drops 
of lime juice, a heaped up table-spoonful of very finely 
chopped curled parsley, and half a cupful of broth.* 

Potatoes a la Lyonnaise are achieved by first frying a 
Bombay onion (chopped small) in butter till it begins to 
brown, then adding a wine-glass of broth with your pieces 
of potato, tossing them till coloured, and finally giving 
them a dust of pepper and salt. 

For a la Proven ^ale, proceed as above, adding a little 
finely pared lime-peel, some chopped parsley, a7i atom of 
garlic, salt, pepper, and a dust of grated nutmeg. When 
serving, sprinkle a little lime juice over the potatoes. 

Potatoes a V Americaine : — Cut up your boiled potatoes 
into thick slices : flavour a little milk with onion, spice, 
pepper, and salt ; strain and thicken it, as laid down for 
melted butter, with butter and flour, till you have a nice 

* Or the slices may be tossed in maitre d'hutel butter, with a few 
spoonfuls of broth. — W. 



OUR VEGETABLES. lot> 



sauce hlancke ; place your slices of potato in this, and heat 
them up to boiling point : take the sauce-pan off the fire, 
stir in the yolk of an egg, add a large spoonful of chopped 
parsley, with a pat of butter the size of a rupee, and serve. 

Potatoes a la Farisienne are slices of potato gently 
heated up in sauce soiihise. 

Waxy potatoes, pressed through the sieve, and served 
like vermicelli, — a favorite dish of Eamasamy's, — ought 
to be most strenuously interdicted. 

There is perhaps no nicer way of serving potatoes with 
chops, steaks, grilled chicken, roast pigeons, &c., than in 
the form of "chips," i.e., Pommes de terre frites. An 
invalid, as a rule, takes a fancy to a potato thus plainly 
cooked, and it is a quicker way of doing it than by any of 
the other recipes. 

In the first place, after washing the potatoes vrell, peel 
them, and slice them carefully a uniform thickness — about 
half that of a rupee say — and spread them on a clean cloth 
to get rid of the moisture. Wipe them thoroughly, and 
spread a sheet of blotting paper ready for draining the 
chips hereafter. !N"ow, dissolve a goodly allowance of beef 
dripping (or Avhatever you use for your frying medium) 
in your/rt7?tre-pan, or a shallow stew-pan; when quite 
boiling, drop in your potato slices — there should be enough 
fat to completely cover them — and let them, as it were, boil 
therein : watch them as they are cooking narrowly, turn- 
ing and moving them about continually, and as soon as 
they assume the golden tint you want, — a nice rich yellow, 
mind, — lift them quickly from the fat, and let them drain 
on the blotting paper for a minute or two. When quite 
dry, turn them into a very hot silver dish (or garnish the 
dish, with which they are to go, with them) and serve. 

The main points to note here are, first the equal thick- 
ness of the slices, for if cut both thick and thin, the latter 

U 



134 CULINARY yOTTIXGS FOR MADRAS. 

will be done more quickly than the former, and it is no 
easy thing to fish out the pieces that have taken colour 
from those that have not. Drying the chips well is essen- 
tial number two, plenty of fat the third, and careful 
drainage when done the fourth. 

Poinmes de terre f rites may be trimmed into various 
shapes, — filberts, dominoes, long narrow strips, &c., and 
cooked exactly as " chips." Uniformity in size is again 
necessary, and careful wiping before cooking. The cook 
must be a bit of an artist too in designing his patterns, or 
there will be sad waste in the cutting. 

A set of French vegetable cutters will be found most 
useful and economical for trimming purposes. 

Ignorant cooks are apt to confound " potato chips," 
with " fried potatoes :" this should be explained away. 
" Fried potatoes," Pomvies de terre sautees, are slices of 
boiled potato tossed about in butter in the 5a?(^e-pan till 
lightly coloured. The " chips," Pommes de terre frites, are 
thin slices of raiv potato absolutely boiled in fat in the 
/ri72< ?-e-pan. 

" Mock new potatoes" make a nice dish for a change, 
and can be contrived out of a waxy tuber that refuses to 
be boiled flourily. Boil the potatoes as usual, and when 
nearly done, cut them into pieces the shape and size of a 
pigeon's egg : make a flour and butter sauce hlanche 
slightly flavoured with mace, and put the pieces of potato 
into it. Simmer the potatoes in the sauce, and when 
thoroughly done, serve. Chopped parsley, a coffee-cupful 
of milk in which the yolk of an egg has been stirred, and 
a lump of butter, may be added at the last moment. 



Peas (petits pais) may be boiled, cooked in the jar, or 
stewed. It is a sine qua non that boiled peas be young 
and fresh. You never get a dish of peas equal to those 



OUR VEGETABLES. 135 

gathered in jour own garden : those bought in the Indian 
market are, as a rule, far too old, having been allowed to 
attain the largest size possible. I have eaten peas from my 
own garden at Bangalore, and Secunderabad, as delicious as 
could be desired. They were small, because the pods were 
cut with their contents scarcely more than three parts 
developed, but for flavour and tenderness, they could not 
have been better. During our winter season at Madras we 
can grow our own peas, and surely the trouble is slight 
when we consider the result. 

For boiled peas : — Put one quart of water with a tea- 
spoonful of salt, one of sugar, and half an ounce of green 
mint on the fire : when it boils, pour in a pint measure of 
shelled peas ; boil quickly ; when done, drain, and turn 
them out upon a frying-pan with an ounce of butter, 
sprinkle a little salt and finely-pounded sugar over them, 
work the pan till the butter melts, and is blended with peas, 
then empty them upon a hot dish and serve. (Gouffe.) 

" Peas in the jar." — This is to my thinking the best way 
of cooking peas. You get the whole flavour of them, they 
are rarely overdone ' to a mash,' as boiled peas in clumsy 
.hands often are, and even old peas become tender and 
eatable by such treatment. Having shelled half a pint of 
peas, put them into a two-pound jam jar, with a screw 
lid, — or a block tin can with a closely fitting top, — (the 
vessel must be completely closed) and put in with them a 
table-spoonful of tinned butter, a salt-spoonful of salt, and 
a tea-spoonful of powdered sugar, a dozen mint leaves, and 
a very little black pepper. Cover the vessel do^vn tightly, 
and immerse it in a stew-pan, or hain-marie half full of 
boiling water. Set the latter on the fire and boil briskly : 
the peas should be examined in half an hour by which 
time, if very young, they should be done. 

The French tinned peas are excellent when thus heated 
up. A quarter of an hour is ample : they should be 



136 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

di-ained from the ' tin' liquor, and washed in ' two or three 
waters,' as cooks say ; that is, fresh water should be poured 
over them two or three times. The fresh butter, mint, 
&c., resuscitate the peas wondei-fully. 

Old peas may be stewed (pet it spots accommodcs) thus : — 
Put a lump of butter into a stew-pan Avitli a Bombay onion 
sliced, a bunch of mint and paisley, and a tea-spoonful of 
salt ; cook this awhile till the onions take a pale colour, 
and then add the peas, vnih. as much broth as will just 
float them : simmer this patiently till the peas are 
thoroughly tender, then take up the pan, strain the liquor» 
spread out the peas on a dish and pick out the pieces of 
onion ; now thicken the liquor witli butter and flour, add- 
ing a tea-spoonful of sugar, and lastly, the peas again • 
stir well, bring the sauce-pan to steaming point, and serve. 

But, after all, there is no way of turning old peas to a 
satisfactory account as good as the puree. For this, boil 
them as previously described, and then work them through 
the sieve. When you have got them through, add butter, 
a little black pepper, salt, a very little sugar, with a 
spoonful of cream or good milk, and serve in a small 
mould. 

The flavour of lettuce is strongly recommended by some 
writers as a help to peas, and onions are also advocated. 
The lettuce should be shred, and put in Avith the peas to 
start with, and the onion should go in whole, both being 
removed when the peas are served. A slice of fat bacon 
is a capital thing to slip in with " jugged peas." 

Peas form a favorite entremets alone ; they should be, 
of course, carefully di-essed, and served as hot as possible. 
The following styles arc recommended : — 

1. ''^ Petifs 20ois au he^trre,^' — boiled, or jugged peas, 
served with a pat of fresh butter melted in a small sauce- 
pan, and mixed with them at the last moment. 



OUR VEGETABLES. 137 

2. " A la creme" — a coffee-cupful of boiling cream 
poured over tlieni just as you serve. 

3. " Au jamhon,"" — finely minced liam, tossed in "butter 
and lightly fried, mixed with boiled, or jugged peas. 

4. " Au lard,'^ — the same method, using bacon instead 
of ham. The bacon atoms should be nice and crisp. 

5. The "p«?-ee," previously described. 



French beans (haricots verts,) are well worthy of our 
attention, for we can get them when other vegetables are out 
of season. They are, besides, the correct accompaniment 
of the roast saddle, the roast loin, and, of course, of venison. 

I^ow, there is a very common and very grievous mistake, 
which cooks — in India especially — are prone to make. 
They slice the pods of this bean into thin strips. By doing 
this, nearly all the flavour of the bean is lost. The pods, 
which must be gathered young, should be simply peeled 
all round to get rid of the delicate fibre, their ends should 
be nipped off, and they should then be plunged into toiling 
water : — a pinch of soda will preserve their bright green 
tint, and at least a tea-spoonful of salt and one of sugar 
should be mixed with the water. If quite young, there 
will be no fibre to remove. 

To preserve the green tint, the following plan is also 
recommended : — Put a large spoonful of wood ashes in a 
piece of linen, fold it up, and place it in a strainer, pouring 
the boiling water in which the beans are to be cooked 
over it. This plan is equally efi&cacious with globe arti- 
chokes, cabbages, &c. (Audot.) 

I have however found that French beans grown in India 
lose so much of their flavour by being hailed that I have 
adopted steaming them in an ordinary vegetable steamer. 
The pods may be cut across into lengths of an inch and a 



138 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

half to facilitate operations. Be sure that the beans are 
quite young, or they will be tough. As soon as the fibre 
round the pods becomes stringy, they are too old. 

Having cooked the beans to your satisfaction, you can 
serve them in the following excellent methods, and always 
secure a nice entremets with them if you like : — 

1. " Aux fines herhes.'' — Turn them out into a hot dish, 
melt a lump of butter in a little sauce-pan with some finely- 
chopped parsley, some common garden cress, some finely- 
minced shallot if approved, some pepper, and a pinch of 
gi'ated nutmeg, — pour over the beans, and serve. 

2. " Au sauce blanche.^' — Make a sauce hlanche with 
flour and melted butter, some of the water in which the 
beans were cooked, salt, pepper, and a little nutmeg ; stir 
into this the yolk of a raw egg, or a spoonful of cream, 
give it two or three drops of lime-juice, and add as above. 

3. " Au sauce au fromage.'" — Make a sauce blanche as 
above, enrich it with the yolks of two eggs and a little 
milk or cream, dredge into it a table-spoonful of mild 
grated cheese, and pom- it over the beans piping hot. 

4. " Au lard.'' — Mince some fat bacon with a little 
shallot, and work them awhile in the sauce-pan : add the 
boiled French beans, toss them about for a minute or two, 
and serve. 

5. " A la creme.'" — Pour a coffee-cupful of boiling cream 
over the beans. 

6. " A la maitre dlwtel.^' — Stir a table-spoonful of 
maitre dliotel butter into them when piping hot. 

A well-made tomato sauce, souhise sauce, or a rich 
veloute, are all applicable to French beans : and a pnulette 
made of butter, a little flour, and some of the water in 
which the beans were cooked, thickened with yolks of 
eggSj and seasoned with salt, assists them greatly. 



OUR VEGETABLES. 139 

French, beans, cold, make a capital salad : I must, how- 
ever, reserve that form of serving them for discnssion 
elsewhere. 

English people are apt to ignore the leans of haricots 
verts, kidney beans, scarlet runners, and dwarf beans, 
which when shelled green, and served in various ways are 
known abroad as flageolets. As a rule we try to eat the 
pods long after they have outgrown their edible stage, and 
have become stringy and tough. Now, the young bean 
when about three parts grown is delicious, and, omitting 
the mint, may be cooked as laid down for peas and served 
as recommended for haricots verts. Flageolets a la creme, 
a la poulette, or a la mattre d'hotel, make quite a first class 
entremets. 

Haeicots verts paxaches, a capital dish, is composed of 
young green pods and shelled beans mixed together. You 
can thus dispose of the old pods, and use the tender ones to 
the best advantage. This recipe will be found useful by 
those who grow their own beans. 

N. B. — The water in which peas or beans are boiled, 
" eau de la cuisson,^^ is, remember, a loeah stoch. Use it 
when making your sauce blanche in preference to milk or 
plain water. 

The pepper used with these vegetables should be black, 
and freshly ground. For this you should possess one of 
the newly introduced pepper-mills. 



OIEiu^X^'TEI^ ^ 



Vegetables— concluded. 

'^^XHJlXGiY,^ (chmx) must be carefully washed, tlicir 
dead and bruised leaves removed, and their stalks 
trimmed neatly. They must then be soaked in salt 
and water, (cold) to get rid of insects, caterpillars, Sac. 
When satisfied that they are fit to cook, plunc^e them into 
boiling water with a tea-spoonful of salt, and a bit of soda 
and lift them as soon as your test with the skewer assures 
you that they are done. Pressure is now necessary to get 
rid of the water, and when thoroughly drained, they can 
be sent up. 

Cabbages however are better done in the steamer, by 
which process they do not absorb so much water, so do 
not require such careful draining. The flavour of all 
green vegetables, indeed, is more successfully developed 
by this system of cookery than by boiling. The only 
objection that may be urged is that their colour is 
rarely so bright. This may be overcome by placing a 
bag with wood ashes enclosed in it in the water. Vege- 
tables should be carefully prepared as if for boiling, some 
salt should be sprinkled over their leaves, and they should 
be placed, dry, in the perforated receptacle that fits into 
the top of the steamer. Water should then be poured 
into the lower vessel, filling it not more than half full. 
The steamer should then be placed over a brisk fire. 



VEGETA BL ES- CONCL UDED. 141 

After steaming has set in, the contents of the receptacle 
should be examined now and then, and tested exactly 
as boiled vegetables are. I can strongly recommend 
Warren's vegetable steamer made of block- tin for this 
process. 

There are numerous methods of dressing gTcens, — ajter 
boiling or steaming them, — which ought to attract favoura- 
ble attention, and I can assure you that with a very little 
trouble you can turn out a most excellent series of dishes, 
which will well repay you, and raise the lowly cabbage to 
a much higher position in your estimation than it at 
present may occupy. 

Before I pass to the fanciful styles in which cabbages 
can be dressed, I ought however to call attention to a bad 
habit that the native cook often indulges in. I mean that 
of chopping up a plain boiled cabbage before serving it. 
Setting aside the ugly appearance that the dish presents 
when thus maltreated, the chopping is a wasteful j)ractice. 
The cut-up "cabbage dries quickly, and will hardly be 
found worth dressing up a second time ; whereas, if served 
Avhole, the portion that may be left after dinner, will 
remain nice and juicy, and will make a recliauffe in the 
form of a "puree with potatoes and butter for breakfast ; 
or, tossed in butter in the frying-pan with finely-minced 
herbs, it will be acceptable with the chop or kidney. Let 
a plainly cooked head of cabbage, therefore, be sent up 
simply divided into quarters, with a pat of fresh butter 
on the top of each, melting from the heat of the greens. 

1. Here is a form of stewed cabbag'e {clioii aii jus) that 
— if the head be nice and young — is worthy of being eaten 
alone : — Take a savoy or any good sort of cabbage, pick it 
carefully, and let it soak in salt and water for an hour ; 
if a large head, you must divide it into quarters, and 
even a small head had better be similarly treated. When 



142 CULINARY JOTJIXGS FOR MADRAS. 

satisfied that the cabbage is thoroughly clean, either steam 
the quarters, or plunge them into boiling hot-water, and 
after boiling for a quarter of an hour, take them out and 
drain them. Xow, mince a thick slice of bacon, and a little 
shallot, parsley, marjoram, and thyme, with a pinch of 
sugar, and pepper and salt to taste ; put all in a stew-pan, 
and set it on the fire. As soon as the bacon melts, lay 
your cabbage quarters in it, and pour round them suffi- 
cient gravy to half cover them. Let this simmer gently 
till the cabbage is done. Then lift out the quarters, place 
them in a hot dish, and cover them up. Strain the gravy, 
thicken it with flour and butter, and pour it over the cab- 
bage. The better your gravy in this case, the better the 
result. If, therefore, you can spare some turkey bones, or 
scraps of game, ham, or tongue to assist youi- ordinary 
stock, youi- entremets will be all the nicer. 

2. Another good way, clion an sauce blanche, may be 
described as follows : — Half -boil your cabbage, take it out, 
and drain it. Divide it into quarters. Make a nicely 
flavoured sauce blanche (adding a little cream if you can 
spare it) place the quarters in this, complete their cooking 
therein, and serve, jDouring the sauce over them. 

3. Cabbages may be cooked with rice, and gi'avy (chou 
an riz) : — Par-boil the cabbage, cut it up into pieces the 
size of an egg, and put them with an equal quantity of 
half -boiled rice, into as much gravy as will cover them, 
simmer till done, then serve. Do not put in more gravy 
than is absolutely necessary, or the dish will turn out 
more like a pot age than an entremets. Grated cheese 
should be handed round with this. 

4. A novel dish, Feuilles cle chou farcies, is recom- 
mended by a good authority which may be described in 
this way : — Boil the head of cabbage till the leaves become 
pliant : take it from the water, gently detach a number of 



VEGETABLES— CONCLUDED. 143 

leaves whole, and dry them on a clean cloth. Have ready 
some pounded quenelle meat of chicken and ham, or tongue 
with an anchovy, or any artistic mixture of savoury meats 
bound with an egg. Arrange a dessert-spoonful of this on 
a cabbage leaf, which roll carefully up in the form of a 
sausage : wrap two or three more leaves round this, and 
tie them up with white tape. Make six, or eight of these, 
and simmer them gently in some good brown gravy till 
the leaves are done. Now, pick out your rolls, untie the 
tapes, dispose them tastefully in the hot dish ready for 
them, thicken the gravy and pour it over them : sippets of 
crisply fried bacon will form an appropriate garnish : serve. 

A little cooked cabbage cut small, forms an agreeable 
addition to a ijot-au-feu, and should always accompany 

potage croute au pot. 

A recipe for perdrix an clioic will be found in the menus. 



Brussels sprouts (Choux de JBruxelles) are susceptible 
of delicate treatment : they can be cooked according to 
recipe number two just given for cabbage, aii, sauce blanche, 
and also (after having been boiled) in the following 
methods : — • 

1. — "J. la maitre dlioteV : — tossed in butter in a sauce- 
pan, with some minced parsley and the juice of a lime 
sprinkled over them, and salt and pepper to taste. 

2. — "J. la Lyonnaise'" : — fry a Bombay onion cut into 
thin rings in some butter ; when a golden colour, add the 
sprouts, toss them together in the pan for a minute, and 
serve hot. 

3. — " ^1 w /«.•," ; — gently simmered in rich brown gravy, 
not thickened, but slightly flavoured w4th spice. 

4. — " A2i heurre : — simply tossed in a good allowance of 
melted butter, with pepper and salt. 



144 CULINARY yOTTJXGS FOR MADRAS. 

5. — '• A la crhne" : — served with a coffee-cupful of boil- 
ing cream poured over them. 

6. — " .4. la pouJette" : — sent to table with a libation of 
good ijoulette sauce. 

Cold greens of all kinds, especially sprouts, are exceed- 
ingly nice eaten plain with a tar tare sauce accompanying 
them. A dressing of oil, vinegar, salt, pepper, and minced 
shallot is also a happy way of improving them ; and I can 
recommend you to try this : — cut some slices of bread into 
fancy shapes, or simple oblongs ; fry them in butter a 
golden brown, spread over them some hot minced gi*eens, 
or pieces of sprouts, and serve them with a nice brown 
sauce, or witli a layer of '' buttered-cggs" on the top of 
the greens. 

Cabbages of all kinds can be served d la puree, vi\i(}i \n 
that way make a capital liomcly soup, or a pleasant accom- 
paniment to an entree. 



The CAULIFLOWKR (Chou-fleur) is, of course, the queen 
of the cabbage kind, and well deserves our most careful 
consideration. In plain treatment, what I have said for 
cabbages generally, holds good for this vegetable also, 
viz. : — draining in salt and water, careful picking, and, if 
to be boiled, plunging into boiling water, with a tiny bit 
of soda to preserve the green tint of the leaves. When, 
boiled, or steamed, which is the better way, you must 
watch them carefully lest they be overdone. 

You can serve cauliflowers with a variety of sauces. 
Cut the stalk flat so that the cauliflower can sit up, as it] 
were, the flower in the centre, and the leaves round it, 
pour about it a good tomato sauce, or a plain sauce hiajiche, 
bechamel, or sauce piquante, and dust some finely rasped] 
crumbs over the whole. 



VEGETABLES— CONCLUDED. 1 45 

After having been half -boiled, very small heads may be 
gently cooked in sauce blanche ; or the flower may be 
divided into sprigs, which can be cooked in clear gravy, 
or in sauce blanche, and served with an entree. But the 
great dish to be studied thoroughly is cauliflower " aiv 
gratin.'" This is as practicable with the remains of a cold 
boiled cauliflower, as with a fresh one. Dispose the pieces 
of cauliflower in a well-buttered dish that will stand the 
oven, pour over them some melted butter : dust some 
grated cheese over them, pepper and salt, bake for ten 
minutes, and serve. 

With a fresh cauliflower you must boil or steam the head 
first till all but done, which you must test with a skewer, 
drain it thoroughly ; then dissolve two ounces of Par- 
mesan, or any mild grated cheese, in a sauce composed as 
follows : — one ounce of butter, one and a quarter ounce of 
flour, one and a half pint of water, pepper, and salt. 
Next arrange the flower to the best of your power in a 
neat pie-dish ; either whole if large enough, or in pieces 
with the green leaves introduced between each piece ; pour 
the sauce well round this, dust a layer of cheese over the 
surface, bake, and serve as soon as the top takes colour. 
A red-hot iron passed closely over the surface of the dish 
will brown it nicely. 

For those who do not like cheese, the following " au 
gratin' is to be recommended : — arrange your pieces of 
cauliflower as before explained, strew over them some fine 
stale bread-crumbs, with some olives, a few capers, and an 
anchovy chopped up small ; pour over this a cupful of hot 
melted butter, bake for ten minutes, and serve. Salad oil 
is better than melted butter, but I fear that my country- 
men will shrink from such a ' foreign' suggestion. 



Spinach (epinards) is a thing that we can get in the

146 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

most trying weather, and Tvitli common care no entremets 
de legumes are more delicate than those which we can 
achieve with this vegetable. Having selected two pounds 
of leaves carefully, wash them well, blanch them by plung- 
ing them for a couple of minutes in scalding water, drain, 
and chop them up. Put into a stew-pan one ounce of 
butter, three quarters of an ounce of floui% and a pinch of 
salt, and one of sugar ; stir this over the fire for three 
minutes, then add the spinach leaves ; stir round for five 
minutes, and moisten with a coffee-cupful of milk, gravy, 
or stock ; stir for two minutes more, and then a breakfast- 
cupful of the milk or stock, stir for five minutes and take 
the pan from the fire. Now, mingle a little butter, with 
the sjjinach, or give it a spoonful of cream, or the yolk of 
an egg dissolved in a little milk, then turn it out upon a 
good hot dish, garnish it with sippets of fried bread, 
fieurons of puff pastry, or short-bread biscuits specially 
baked for the dish, and serve. I mix a little grated cheese 
with the short-bread paste which I think goes well with 
the spinach, and some give the least suspicion of sugar ; I 
think that the savoury method is the better of the two. 

Short-bread biscuits for spinach may be made as fol- 
lows : — Put three ounces of flour into a bowl and mix into 
it two ounces of butter liquefied, a tea-spoonful of salt, 
a salt-spoonful of sugar and an ounce of grated cheese, 
roll out the paste, cut it into heart-shapes one-third of an 
inch thick, and bake. 

Fieurons of nice puff-pastry are often given, and nothing 
can be nicer — as an entremets — than little patties made of 
puff-pastry, or short-bread crust, filled with carefully-made 
spinach 'puree, and capped with buttered-egg. 

It is not at all necessary to pass spinach through a sieve. 
If they are young, and tender, you should, after draining 
and blanching the leaves thoroughly, chop them ujd, and 



VEGETA BLES— CONCL UDED, 1 4 7 

cook them as I have described. You can serve them with 
a poached egg or two on the top of them ; or you can fry 
some slices of bread, batter them, and dress your minced 
spinach over them, with a cap, for each piece, of " butter ed- 
Qgg,''^ or a tiny pat of mattre d'hotel butter, 

A nice mild anchovy toast, kept hot in the oven, and 
served with a layer of spinach over its surface is very 
nice : whilst a little mound of chopped spinach, garnished 
with hard boiled eggs, forms an attractive centre for an 
entree of cutlets. A pleasing looking entremets of spinach 
is made by shaping the greens in a circle, and leaving a 
hollow centre to be filled with " buttered-egg" coloured 
red with tomato-pulp. 



Endive (cMcoree) may be treated exactly as I have de- 
scribed for spinach, but being a tougher leaf, it will require 
a little more time in the stew-pan. The young leaves of 
beetroot, " turnip tops" (leaves), and water-cress, are 
capable of similar dressing. 



Sorrel (oseille) which should be dressed in the manner 
described for spinach is not half enough used. Your cook 
will know it if you order " sorley," — (Ramasamy's pro- 
nunciation of the double ' r' being peculiar) — and nothing 
is nicer than a mutton (neck) cutlet or fillet of beef 
with a sorrel puree, for the pungent taste of the vegetable 
suggests a novelty to your palate. 

My readers who are in the habit of enjoying themselves 
on the Neilgherries ought to try a dish of pork cutlets 
with a puree of sorrel (menu N'o. 12), for with a rich white 
meat, sorrel is especially agreeable. I mentioned this 
vegetable in connection with poiage d, la honne femme when 
talking about soups, and I may add now that a plain gravy 
soup thickened, and flavoured with sorrel puree is far 



148 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

from bad. In cooking sorrel, onion and a little sugar are 
essential, and lettuce leaves are a great assistance. 

This vegetable is largely cultivated by the Natives. 
Hind : — chookeh-jmluk. 



The Jerusalem artichoke (topinamhour) is a vegeta- 
ble which, as a rule, people either dislike exceedingly, or 
are very fond of. I place it amongst the best we have. 
Wash the artichokes, peel and shape them nicely, drop- 
ping each one into salt and water at once to prevent its 
turning black ; when all are ready, put them into a sauce- 
pan with a gallon of cold-water, and two table-spoonfuls 
of salt ; boil till tender (which will take about twenty 
minutes after boiling-point has been attained) and drain, 
serving them with a nice sauce blanche. 

Or, when tlirec parts done, you can lift them up, and 
simmer them till quite done, in rich brown gravy. 

Or, you can, when half-boiled, drain them dry, and bake 
them upon a well-buttered tin, serving them with plain 
melted butter, a dressing of oil, vinegar, minced shallot 
and salt, or any sauce piquante you fancy. 

But, like the cauliflower, the Jerusalem artichoke is 
worthy of the epicure's attention when sent up " au 
gratin." The combination being a puree of plain boiled 
artichoke, slightly diluted with cream, and seasoned with 
pepper, and salt : this, turned into a well-buttered pie-dish, 
its surface dusted over with finely grated mild cheese, and 
the whole baked until the top takes colour. Good milk 
with the yolks of two eggs may take the place of cream, 
or a sauce blanche, but if perfection be desired, pray use 
cream. 

Instead of using a pie-dish the puree may be baked in 
some well-buttered coquille shells, and served upon a 
napkin. 



VEGETABLES— CONCLUDED. 149 

Another artistic raethod of doinsr tliis vetretable is this : — 
Cut half a dozen large ones, after thej have been three 
parts boiled, into long strips about a quarter of an inch 
thick, dip them, in the batter I describe elsewhere, and fry 
them a golden tint : these fritters are excellent ; you can 
order them alone as an entremets, or pile them in a pyramid 
as the central garnish of an entree. 

Jerusalem artichokes can be served in a mould, iced, 
with a mayonnaise sauce, or hot with a Parmesan, or rich 
white sauce. For the mould, follow this recipe : — Two 
pounds of the artichokes boiled in milk : half a pint of 
cream : four eggs : pepper and salt. Mash the artichokes, 
and pass them through the hair sieve, add the cream, the 
eggs well beaten up whites and all, and season with 
pepper and salt. Put the mixture into a well-buttered 
mould, and steam it for one hour. Turn it out, and garnish 
it with tomato puree, Parmesan sauce, or a rich veloiite. 

Or : — ice the mould, and turn it out, sending it up with 
a cold mayonnaise sauce in a boat. The name of this 
excellent entremets here is " Topinamhours a la Chetput,^* 
but it is commonly called creme de topinamiours. 



Undeniably good as the Jerusalem artichoke is, it is, of 
course, inferior to the Globe or leafy kind (articliaut) . 
These are properly considered the choicest delicacies of the 
Neilgherry market by many people. A globe artichoke, 
like a cabbage, must be well soaked in salt and water to 
get rid of the insects which may be hidden between the 
leaves. Then it must be set head downwards in boiling 
water, with soda and salt, and boiled till the leaves part 
easily from the core. When done, you must drain it, and 
dish it hot : a little " Dutch sauce," in which a few drops 
of anchovy vinegar, or lime-juice have been introduced, 
forms an agreeable accompaniment. 



150 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

There are several high class ways of ser\'ing globe arti- 
chokes which I, of course, dedicate to my readers who 
happen to be staying on the Hills. 

First let me give yon dii'ections for the trimming of an 
artichoke secundum artem. Place the raw vegetable bottom 
downwards on a board, and with a sharp knife at once cnt 
it straight down, dividing it in half ; then divide each half 
so obtained so that you have four quarters : next pare out 
the ' choke' which adheres to each quarter, as you would 
core an apple, and trim off the leaves leaving about an 
eighth of an inch of them unsevered and adhering to the 
trimmed quarters. Drop each piece as you trim it into 
cold water in which a lime has been squeezed, or a 
table-spoonful of vinegar poured, to prevent its turning 
black, and when you have prepared enough for the dish 
you require, throw the quarters into boiling water witli a 
dessert-spoonful of salt, and a spoonful of vinegar ; and in 
about fifteen minutes, when nearly done, lift them out and 
drain them. They may be now finished off in these several 
ways :— 

1. — As " beigiiets" : — by being cut into slices dipped in 
batter, and fried in boiling fat till of a bright golden tint. 

2. — Or, — " an sauce blanche'^ or " bechamel,^' in which 
they should be gently simmered. 

3. — Or, — "(i la maitre dlioteV: — tossed in butter, and 
served on a hot silver dish, with the melted butter, a 
squeeze of lime juice and a sprinkling of very finely 
chopped cui'led parsley. 

4. — Or, — " au gratin'^ : — the pieces neatly disposed upon 
a silver dish, with a little gravy round them to keep them 
from burning, dusted over with very finely sifted bread- 
crumbs, chopped mushroom, parsley, and a little shallot, 
pepper, salt, and a piece of butter on the top of each piece, 
then baked for ten minutes and served hot. 



VEGETABLES— CONCLUDED. 151 

5. — Or, " a V Italienne^^ : — as in the foregoing, substitut- 
ing a dusting of mild grated cheese for bread-crumbs, 
omitting the mushroom and chopped herbs, and merely 
adding the pepper, salt, and butter. 

6. — Or, " a V Es^pagnole^ : — gently simmered in rich 
brown sauce. 

7. — Or, " a la Lyonnaise'^ : — the pieces heated in the 
oven very carefully, piled upon a hot silver dish, and a 
rich brown sauce (with finely minced onion fried, and a 
table-spoonful of minced parsley incorporated therewith) 
poured over them. 

8. — Or, a la poivrade' : — trimmed as aforesaid, sim- 
mered in hlanc, and served with sauce poivrade. 

Artichoke bottoms (fonds d' artichauts entiers) are trim- 
med in this way : — Cut the tops of the leaves horizontally? 
parallel with, and close down to the top of the "/oncZ." 
Trim all leaves that may adhere to the fond quite closely 
all round, and pare off the stalk smoothly. Now, plunge 
the artichoke bottoms into boiling salt and water, and 
blanch them to facilitate the scooping out of the " choke," 
which should be done with a silver spoon. With arti- 
chokes thus prepared you can turn out : — 

Fonds d'articTiauts a la harlgoule : — Having scooped out 
the chokes, and drained six artichoke bottoms of a fair 
size, give them a dust of salt and pepper, put them on a 
clean dish, and prepare this ' farce' : — four ounces of finely 
minced bacon, a quarter ounce of butter and the same 
weight of flour, a coffee-cupful of broth, and one table- 
spoonful of very finely minced parsley, one table- spoonful 
of finely minced mushrooms, and one dessert-spoonful of 
finely chopped white onion. Stir the mixture over the 
fire for five minutes, and then fill the hollows of the arti- 
choke bottoms with it. Tie a very thin slice of bacon over 
each fond, and put them in a stew-pan with a breakfast- 



152 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

cupful of good gravy. Put the stew-pan into the oven, 
and bake for twenty minutes, ascertain if tender, then 
dish up and serve, [Gouffe.] 

Audot recommends that the fonds be placed upon lean 
slices of veal or pork, which should be laid at the bottom 
of a braising-pan ; that the gravy should be poured in, 
and that the process should be that of braising. 

For fonds d'artichaitts a la Proveno/rle, prepare the arti- 
chokes as above without the ' farce,' place them in a pie- 
dish with enough salad oil to keep them moist and safe 
from burning, and with six cloves of gai-lic, pepper, and 
salt. Put the dish into the oven, and bake : when the 
fonds are tender, remove the garlic, give them a dust of 
pepper and the squeeze of a lime, dish up, and serve. 
People who dislike oil, and a ' far-off' suspicion of garlic 
can, of course, use melted butter, and slices of shallot. 

Fonds d'artichauts a la bechamel, or a la creme, make a 
very excellent entremets. Trim as already described, sim- 
mer them in blanc, and serve eitlier with bechamel sauce, 
or boiling cream. 

I have been successful with/ond? d'artichauts a la mo'elle. 
Cook the fonds till tender in hlanc. Prepare some beef 
marrow — i.e., cut the marrow into pieces, and blanch them 
in scalding water. Take as many coqnIlJes as you have 
fonds, put a little of the marrow into each shell, over that 
place Sifond, fill the cavity of the fo7id with marrow, heat 
the coqmlles hot, and just before you serve, pour over each 
a little Espagnole sauce. If you have no coquilles, pastry 
cases answer very well : make them in round patty pans. 

Cold boiled artichoke bottoms can be mashed up with 
cream, and a little butter, seasoned with pepper and salt, 
top-dressed with crumbs, and baked in a little pie-dish, 
or in silver coqiUlle shells. 



VEGETA BLES—CONCL UDED. 153 

Or, the mixture can be placed inside little pastiy patties 
like oyster patties and served on a napkin (Bouchees d'arti- 
chauts). This latter method is equally practicable with 
Jerusalem artichoke puree, and if youi' cook can make 
light pastry, these little patties, will be found very nice 
indeed. 

Remember when writing your menu, with regard to 
these two vegetables, that the *" artichauf is the globe or 
leafy kind. The Jerusalem artichoke should be called 
' topinambour.' 



Turnips, (navets,) do not require much discussion ; it 
should be remarked, however, that when nice and young, 
they are well worthy of attention, especially as garnishes 
for entrees^ stews, &c. Think of appearance when serving 
them, and shape the roots into little cones or ovals, of an 
equal size. I once saw a dish of tui'nips served a la 
creme which was quite worthy of separate service as an 
entremets : the roots had been cut into pieces and shaped 
about the size of a bantam's Qgg, boiled to a turn, and 
served with a coffee-cupful of boiling cream poured over 
them to finish with. 

Trimmed in the same way, young turnips can be sent 
up a la youlette, or a la bechamel. 

The French dish of young turnips called navets glaces 
ought to be very popular. Trim the turnips into shapes 
like small pears, or cones, and boil them till nearly done 
in salt and water ; drain them, and put them into a sauce- 
pan with plenty of melted butter, and sprinkle them 
bountifully with powdered sugar, stir gently over the fire 
mitil they begin to brown, and then add a spoonful or two 
of clear stock : pepper and salt should now be given, let 
them simmer till quite tender and serve them in their own 
sauce. 



154 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 



It is recommended by some to let tlie sugar form a sort 
of caramel round the turnips before adding the stock : in 
that case you must put the turnip pieces (when the 
caramel stage has been reached) into a separate sauce-pan, 
wash out the first one with a little stock, pour that ovei- 
them, and stew gently as in the other recipe. Caramel 
is, of coui'se, sugar slowly melted over the fire, till it has 
attained a rich brown tint. 

Parsnips, knolkhol, and small round onions, (of the size 
usually pickled) are susceptible of similar treatment, and 
any brown entree may be garnished with vegetables glaces 
in this form. 

The puree of turnips with cream is, of course, well 
known, and all root vegetables make toothsome additions 
to your ordinary dish of meat, or cutlets, us purees, or 
mixed cunningly as a macedoine de legumes. 



Small ' early' carrots (carottes) and PARSXirs (panais) 
may be trimmed a uniform size, boiled gently, and finally 
tossed in butter, in a frying-pan, with pepper, salt, and 
some finely-powdered sugar. 

Or, they may be similarly treated, and sent up a la 
mattre d'hutel, aux fines herhes, ^r. 

Carrots cut into round balls, gently simmered till ten- 
der in blanc, and then dressed with sauce blonde, or a la 
poulette, make a charming central garnish for a dish of 
cutlets, which, when thus presented, should be called " a 
la Nivernaise.'' 

Garottes a la Flamande are worthy of close considera- 
tion : — Choose a pound and a half of tender carrots, blanch 
them in scalding water, scrape ofE their tough skin, and j 
trim them in slices the eighth of an inch thick. Put the 
pieces into a stew-pan with one ounce of butter, a pinch] 



VEGETABLES- CONCLUDED. 1 55 

of salt and one of sugar, and a coffee-cupful of water. 
Cover the pan, and simmer for twenty minutes, shaking 
the pan occasionally to ensure even cooking. When done, 
remove the pan, let its contents cool a little, and then stir 
in two yolks of eggs, a coffee-cupful of cream, and half an 
ounce of butter ; add a table- spoonful of chopped parsley 
and serve. 



The ONION, (oignon,) can be made a good deal of either 
stuffed plainly, or with sheeps' kidneij, as I have described 
in my menus : indeed whether plainly boiled, or stewed, 
onions rarely fail to please those who are fond of them. 

A very presentable dish is " oignons au gratin^ made in 
this way : — boil them in milk till tender ; cut them up as 
finely as possible and mash them, pass through a w4re 
sieve, mix the pulp well, adding a coffee-cupful of cream, 
or milk enriched with the yolk of an egg, pepper, and 
salt. Put the puiSe into a shallow pie-dish, strew a layer 
of grated cheese over the surface, and bake for a few 
minutes till the top takes colour. You must, of course, 
butter the pie-dish, and also sprinkle a little melted butter 
over the cheese. 

Onions, if of a moderate size, can be served a la creme, 
a la hechamel, a VEspagnole, 8fc., and are invariably accept- 
able with the releve when so treated. 



Vegetable marrows, (courges a la moelle,) are very 
nice, and in their turn not to be passed over. I think the 
best way of cooking them is to steam, or bake them till all 
but done, then to lift, and drain them, removing the 
seeds, and shaping them into fillets, &c., as desired. You 
can then heat the fillets up in a previously made white, 
or brown sauce flavoured to taste, and serve them as soon 



156 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

as tender. Marrows should, of course, be peeled before 
steaming. 

The vegetables marro^v is also worthy of a place amongst 
entremets de legumes, when served " an gratin,^^ baked in 
layers, or fillets, in a little stock, and dusted over with 
grated cheese ; or as " heignets" : — partly cooked, and cut 
into convenient pieces, which should be dipped in batter, 
and fried a golden brown in boiling fat. 

An uncommon dish with a marrow is that called " mock 
whitebait" : — You parboil the marrow, and then cut it up 
into a number of pieces about the size of the whitebait, 
then roll them in flour, and fry them, at a gallop in seeth- 
ing fat ; lift them out and drain them when they turn a 
golden yellow, and serve witli a dust of cayenne, and 
limes, cut in quarters, handed round with brown-bread 
and butter. 

Carefully avoid the awful English custom of serving 
marrows on sodden toast. 



Cucumbers, (concomhre.?) may be cooked exactly as laid 
down for vegetable-marrows. They form a most pleasing 
and delicate garnish for boiled fish, or cutlets, when 
dressed a la poulette as follows : — 

Take a good sized cucumber, or two small ones ; cut 
them lengthwise into quarters, remove the seeds, and peel 
off the green skin. Cut them into pieces two inches long 
and one inch thick, and put them into a stew-pan with 
plenty of boiling water, half an ounce of butter, and a 
tea-spoonful of salt. Simmer them until three parts done ; 
then drain the liquor off, and turn the pieces of cucum- 
ber out upon a clean dish, cut each piece in half and cover 
them up. Make half a pint of poulette sauce, put the 
pieces of cucumber into it, warm gently in the hain-marie, 
and serve — 



VEGETABLES— CONCLUDED. 1 57 

Or, the pieces may be simmered until cooked, then 
drained, piled up on a hot silver dish, and served with a 
pat of maitre d' hotel butter melting over them. In this 
manner they are very nice with a dish of lamb cutlets. 

Small cucumbers and marrows may be stuffed, and 
cooked as follows : — (concomhres farcis) Peel the cucumber, 
slice off a piece at one end, and pick out the seeds with a 
marrow-spoon ; stuff the hollow thus formed with a farce 
made of pounded meat, and bread-crumb, two-thirds of the 
former to one of the latter. Season the farce with pepper 
and salt, a little minced shallot and parsley, and bind it 
with a well whipped egg ; fix on the end you removed with 
white of egg', and secure it with tape. The cucumber can 
now be baked, or gently simmered in some gTavy which 
should be thickened and poui^ed over it when done. 

Pumpkins, (potirons), may be treated much in the same 
manner as marrows and cucumbers. 



Beetroot, (Betterave) . — This root, chiefly used cold as a 
salad by itself, or mixed with other vegetables in salad, is 
by no means to be despised when served hot with a nice 
poulette sauce. Beetroot is far better baked than boiled. 
After having thus cooked it, cut it into slices, season them 
with pepper, salt, chopped parsley, and cress, and give 
them a turn or two in a pan with a pat of butter and a 
few drops of vinegar. Dish up, and pour a poulette 
sauce over them. 

Beetroot leaves can be turned to excellent account either 
dressed as spinach, for which the tender ones sliould be 
chosen, or as cardoons in which case the mid-rib of the 
tougher leaves should be cut out, and gently stewed in hlanc. 



Tomatoes, (tomatesj form a most valuable portion of our 

U 



158 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

vegetable produce. They are easily grown in this Presi- 
dency, and are often procui'able when the stock of garden 
stuff has sunk to its lowest stage during the hot weather. 
Whether cut up cold in its raw state, and eaten as a salad, 
— or, in the form of puree as a soup, or sauce, — " au 
gratin" as an entremets, — with maccaroni, — with fish, or 
with other vegetables, as a garnish, — the tomato never 
fails to be a welcome friend. In Italy, Spain, and 
Southern Fi*ance, it forms a staple part of the daily food 
of all classes, and I believe that I am right in saying that 
it is a very wholesome vegetable in a hot climate. I give 
you elsewhere several dishes in which tomatoes play an 
important part, I will, therefore, confine myself now to 
two excellent recipes for serving them as an entremets. 

" Au gratin' : — Cut a slice off the top of each tomato as 
you would decapitate a boiled eg^. With a dessert-knife 
scoop out the pulp and seeds from the shell as well as you 
can, put the cases so obtained on one side : make a puree 
with the scooped out pulp, flavour it nicely like tomato 
sauce, strain off the seeds, and thicken it with fine bread- 
crumbs : beat up some eggs (one for every two cases) and 
mix the whole well ; add pepper and salt, stuff the cases 
therewith, give the surface of each a light dusting of 
grated cheese, bake on a buttered dish for ten minute.«5. 
and serve. 

Another method, which has the advantage of simplicity, 
may be followed in this way. Put an ounce of butter into 
a small stew-pan, throw into it a table-spoonful of finely 
minced sweet onion, put the pan on the fire and lightly 
fry the onion ; before the pieces take color, put into the 
vessel four or five large, or a dozen small tomatoes, cut up 
into small pieces. Stir well over the fire until the tomatoes 
are thoroughly cooked. Now, rub an au gratin dish with 
a piece of garlic, butter it, and pour into it the contents of 



I 



VEGETABLES-CONCLUDED. 169 

the stew-pan, dust over the surface a lajer of Parmesan, 
Grujere, or other mild cheese, and bake for eight or ten 
minutes : serve hot, 

'^ A Vltalienne'^ : — Cut the tomatoes in halves, scoop out 
the pulp and seeds with a silver spoon, and place them on 
a baking dish upon which you have poured a little of the 
best salad oil. Make a mixture of grated ham, bread- 
crumbs, some finely minced shallot, parsley, marjoram, 
and thyme, seasoned with pepper and salt ; mix this with 
the tomato pulp, and fill the cases, covering them com- 
pletely, shake an allowance of salad oil in drops over all, and 
bake for a few minutes, serving the dish intact as it comes 
from the oven. The proportion of crumbs to the ham 
should be two spoonfuls of the former, to one of the latter, 
the flavouring herbs, &c., to taste at discretion. Chopped 
anchovies, olives, capers, mushrooms and truffles, can be 
introduced if at hand, and butter (melted) may be used by 
those who do not like oil. 



Celery (celeri), is an exceedingly nice vegetable not 
only when sent round, raw, with cheese, but also when 
cooked in various ways as an entremets. In the latter 
case the heads should be very neatly trimmed and cut 
short, say five or six inches in length. They can then 
be split lengthwise in two or four pieces according to the 
thickness of the head. When prepared satisfactorily, the 
pieces should be plunged into fast boiling water, and as 
soon as tender, drained, turned out upon a hot silver dish, 
and served like asparagus with a pat of butter melting 
over them, a piping hot " Dutch sauce" being sent round 
in a boat. 

. Celery may be also stewed gently in weak stock, or 
hlanc and then be presented a VEsjpagnoU (covered with a 
thick rich brown sauce), or au jus in clear gravy.

Blanc, which I have already mentioned with reference to 
vegetable cookerv, is a kind of stock made as follows : — 
Cut up as small as possible a quarter of a pound of fat 
bacon, and a quarter of pound of beef suet, and put the 
pieces with a bacon bone, or some broken-up chicken bones, 
into a stew-pan. Add a couple of carrots, and two large 
sweet onions cut up small, a bunch of curly parsley, a 
tea-spoonful of dried thyme or marjoram, a dozen pepper 
corns, a tea-spoonful of sugar and one of salt, and stir well 
over a brisk fire till the fat melts well, and the vegetables 
begin to fry in it. Do not let them brown, but pour in 
before that stage arrives enough warm water to cover the 
contents of the pan. Draw the pan to the edge of the fire. 
Cook the contents of it at first gently, gradually adding 
heat, and finally encouraging evaporation by actual boil- 
ing, and stirring the contents of your pan to prevent them 
catching. When the liquor has diminished to about a 
quarter of its original quantity, strain it off into a bowl. 
When required, tliis vegetable essence should be carefully 
skimmed poured into a sauce-pan, and sufficient water 
should be added to cook the celery or other vegetable that 
may be jnit into it. 

Celery stewed in hlanc can be served advantageously 
a la ynoelle, i.e., with beef marrow. In this case you must 
pile the celery in the centre of the dish, thicken the hlayic 
in which it was cooked, and pour it over the pile. 

The marrow should be treated in this way : — Break the 
bone, take out the raw marrow, cut it into dice, blanch 
them for five minutes in scalding water, drain them, and 
heat them up gently In a little of the sauce en haia-marie. 
A dessert-spoonful each of this should be put into little 
croustades of fried bread, and served round the celery as a 
garnish. Cut your croustades square, out of stale bread, 
and hollow a little space in each to hold the marrow.

Cardoons, (cardons) a la moelle are of course well known 
hj those who have travelled abroad. I have seen tinned 
cardoons in India, but not the vegetable itself. Accord- 
ing to M. Aiidot the strong mid-ribs of the leaves of white 
beetroot (cardes poirSes), and the tender stalks of globe 
artichokes (pieds d'artichauts) form a nice substitute. The 
latter should be scraped free from their fibrous skin, and 
stewed iu blanc as described for celery a la moelle. 

In order to blanch the artichoke stems, it is necessarj, 
after the vegetable has been gathered, to bend the shoot 
down, and earth it up : the parts thus covered turn whit-e, 
and you in this way obtain an excellent substitute for 
cardoons. 



Salsify — (salsijis on scorsonera) is an edible root which 
we ought to grow abundantly in India. There are two 
kinds of this vegetable : — the white and the black. The 
former is called salsijis, the latter scorsonera. The one is 
gathered in its first year's growth, the other not until it is 
two years old. I do not know whether any of our horti- 
-cultural societies have yet introduced salsify or not ; in 
case it may have been grown, I take the opportunity of 
recommending the previous recipe (viz. : — a la moelle) as 
equally applicable to the gently stewed roots of this plant. 

Salsify has a very perceptible flavour of the oyster (is 
indeed called the " oyster plant" in America), and forms 
several delicious entremets. The roots peel easily when 
boiled, and the pulp is as white as snow. Simply mashed 
with cream, and a tea-spoonful of anchovy sauce, with a 
covering of bread-crumbs strewn over it, and a little melted 
butter, then baked till brown, and served in coquilles, 
salsify presents an exact imitation of " oysters scalloped." 
Salsify puree with cream can be served wherever oyster 
isauce is recommended, with a tasty fillet of beef for 



162 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

instance, it makes a most toothsome ^la^/V, and as a white 
Fonp (puree) it can be sent up as a bisque cVhuttres. 

Never peel black salsify (:<corsonera) before boiling, for, 
if cut, it " sweats,'' and loses much of its moisture. Boil 
first, and peel afterwards. This advice is the result of 
personal experience. 

Asparagus, and seakale, if procui^ble, should be picked 
carefiillj, washed, and tied up in little bundles with all 
the heads level : then, with a very sharp knife, the stalks 
should also be cut level. Put the trimmed bundles into 
fast boiling water with a good allowance of salt and a 
little sugar. They should then be carefully di'ained, and 
served an nafnrel, with " Diitcli sauce," or a plain dressing 
of oil, vinegar, pepper, and salt. 

The following wrinkle is given by the author of Food 
and Feeding : — 

" Asparagus of the stouter sort, always when of the giant 
Tariety, should be cut of exactly equal lengths, and boiled 
standing ends (the green tips) upwards, in a deep sauce-pan. 
Nearly two inches of the heads should be out of the water 
— the steam sufficing to cook them, as they form the ten- 
derest part of the plant ; while the hard stalky part is 
rendered soft and succulent by the longer boiling which 
this plan permits. A period of thirty or forty minutes on 
the plan i^commended will render fully a third more of 
the stalk delicious, while the head will be properly cooked 
in the steam alone." 

There is a custom followed by ignorant English, as well 
as by native cooks, of placing a slice of toasted bread in 
the dish destined to receive a bundle of asparagus, seakale, 
&,c., over which they finally pour a plentiful bath of taste- 
less flour and water called " w^hite sauce." The toast is 
utterly unnecessary, and the sauce — butter plainly melted 



VEGETABLES— CONCLUDED. 163 

— ought invariably to be handed round, piping hot, in 
a boat. 

A few drops of tarragon vinegar should be stirred into 
the " Dutch sauce," and the vegetable having been care- 
fully di^ained should be laid in a very hot dish, with a pat 
of fresh butter or maitre d' hotel butter placed on top of it 
to melt over all. 

Asparagus ought never to be served in the ordinary 
English fashion with common sauce hlanclie. Fresh butter, 
melted, with salt, and a drop or two of vinegar, form its 
simplest and nicest aid. 

Tinned asparagus may be treated exactly in the same 
way after having been drained, gently washed (by pouring 
cold water over it) and heated up in the bahi-marie, or in 
its own tin (drained and washed) placed in a vessel of 
hot water, the water reaching about half-way up the tin. 
Care should be taken to avoid over-doing tinned asparagus, 
and in turning it into the dish also, lest it break. " Dutch 
sauce," in a piping hot boat, should accompany it. 

A very nice way of serving tinned asparagus as an 
entremets is iced, with pure cream also iced as its sauce. 
It is, in this way, quite the best " dressed vegetable" for 
a hot weather dinner. 

The green ends of asparagus (^'points d'asperges"') form 
an artistic accompaniment to an entree, they are excellent 
when added to a clear soup, and make a very sTi-pevh puree. 
" Asparagus peas" are made by chopping the green ends 
of the shoots into dice, and treating them then as peas. 



And this leads me to the subject of tinned vegetables. 

Nothing proves the inferiority of the English system of 
vegetable cookery more palpably than the futile efforts of

OTir best exporters of preserved provisions to compete, in 
this particular branch of their business, with the great 
French and American firms. Compare the tinned <yro€n 
peas, or asparagus, exported by Crosse and Blackwell with 
the petits pois verts, or asperges we get from France. Of 
these I Iiave ah-eadj- spoken ; we may accordingly proceed 
to consider : — 

Tinned French bea^s, (haricots verts). Those excellent 
vegetables should be turned out upon a saute-^pan tossed in 
butter until hot, and served. Or they may be treated in 
any of the methods already set forth for fresh haricots verts. 
They make excellent ^zi?Je.s% and may be cooked with othei' 
vegetables in a macedoine de le'jiimes. I strongly recom- 
mend them to be served a la cremc, or a la jwulette, with a 
saddle of mutton. 

Flageolets, another delicious tinned legume, should bo 
served a la poulette, or a la creme, or ])lainly d la niaitr' 
dliolel. They are very effective wlicn associated with 
other vegetables " a la viacedoiney 

FONDS d'aktichauts, if delicately handled, may be cooked 
up in any of the ways recommended for the fresh arti- 
choke. 

Points d'asperges are, as a rule, too soft to stand much 
manipulation. The safest plan is to heat them en bain- 
marie in their tin, and then to turn them into the soup or 
sauce in which they are to be served. They make an ex- 
cellent addition to a chaud-froid if placed carefully in the 
centre of the border of aspic. Pure iced cream is, in such 
circumstances, their best sauce. 

Macedoine de legumes as a central garnish for cutlets 
can hardly be surpassed. The viacedoine must be gently 
heated up in a really good poulette, or bechamel sauce, and 
a. spoonful of cream should be added if possible.

These excellent French tinned vegetables make, when 
cleverly amalgamated, a most delicious salad. For this 
thev should be iced. 



I have the highest respect for all country vegetables, 
and have given recipes for cooking brinjals, (hinegun) , 
BANDEKAi, (hlilndi), GREENS, (bliagee), podolongkai, (chu- 
choonda), morixgakai, (moorivgn), &c., which will be found 
amongst my 'menus. 

Indian corn, or maize. Tarn., mncJcaclwlum ; Hind., 
boota ; is capable of artistic treatment a VAmericaine, — 
stripped from the young pod, boiled like peas, and then 
drained, tossed in melted butter, peppered, salted and 
served. Plenty of butter is a sine qua non. Or the corn 
may be stripped off after boiling, and similarly treated. . 

It is useless to attempt to serve Indian corn unless the 
cobs be quite young. 

All country beans, from the '• duffin" bean downwards, 
may be cooked, when nice and young, as broad-beans 
(feves de marais) : — boiled, with plenty of salt in the 
water, till the skins crack, then peeled and tossed in 
batter, and served: or they may be sent up as Si puree 
somewhat stiffly worked. 

The water in which beans are cooked should be hoiling 
when they are first put in. 

Here is a good standard dish of beans (feves a la hour- 
geoise) : — 

Having boiled and skinned the beans, turn them into a 
stew-pan over a slow fire with a table-spoonful of tinned 
butter ; mix with them a table-spoonful of flour, and mois- 
ten with some of the water in which the beans were boiled ; 
season with pepper and salt, and when nice and creamy, 
serve. 



166 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

Dried haricot beans (Soissons) are now procurable in 
India, a few leading firms having imported them in the 
bag from France, and America. These vegetables will be 
found most valuable, for they are very nutritious and 
wholesome. They must be soaked for at least twelve 
hours, and then be placed in cold water with a little salt, 
and gradually boiled. When boiling point has been 
attained, the vessel should be drawn to the side of the fire, 
and its contents simmered till they are soft. They should 
be served with a pat of butter melting among them, a dust 
of freshly ground black pepper, and salt. Bacon, cut into 
dice and fried, may be introduced with them or they may 
be served a la 'potdelte, a la maitre d'hotel, or with brown 
sauce. When served in brown sauce with a leg of mutton, a 
sauce soiihise accompanying, you have yigot a la Bretonne. 

These beans (Lima) are exported from America in cans, 
already cooked. They can be served as above described. 

For country greens, follow the receipts given for 
spinach, sorrel, endive, and turnip-tops. 

A vegetable can always be got in the hot weather called 
(locally) " mollat" the tender branches or stalks of which 
are edible, (" mollay-keeray"). Treated as laid down for 
asparagus, you will find this vegetable worth trying. 

Be sure that the stalks are nice and young, cut them 
into three inch lengths, tie them in bundles, and boil them 
in boiling salt and water, then drain carefully, and serve 
them with a nice sharp sauce in a boat ; or iced, with 
cream. The young leaves of this plant can also be dressed 
as spinach. 

Water-cress common on our Hills, and fi-equently grown 
in private gardens, can be dressed like spinach, and in 
that form will be found most tasty. 

Young PUMKiNS, " DiL-pussuND," or MARROWS, gathered 
prematurely (when the size of a duck's egg) boiled, and 



VEGETABLES— CONCLUDED. 167 

served as described for artichoke bottoms, are exceedingly 
nice. 

Purees of sweet potatoes, and yams, if assisted by cream, 
are very eatable. Fritters of the former are nice if the 
slices be marinaded in a little brandy and lime-juice, and 
then dipped in a well-made batter. Yams may be treated 
in most of the ways recommended for potatoes. 

In short, if we look about us, and try our best to make 
the most of the vegetables of the country, by careful 
cookery of the reformed school, we need never be without 
a pleasant dish to relieve the ding-dong monotony of our 
market supplies. The more you hunt about amongst the 
produce of the native gardens, the more surprised you will 
be at the opportunities afforded you of practising your 
culinary ingenuity. For over a century we have been 
contented to see a few country vegetables sent up in 
curries, and in curries only, never attempting to develop 
their latent good qualities by artistic treatment. 

There are times when the supply of vegetables grown 
from English seed may fail us, or when we cannot expect 
to procure them ; when on the line of march, for instance, 
out in the jungles, or when quartered at some little place 
far from the busy haunts of our fellow white men ; the 
amateur who has studied native vegetables will then dis- 
cover that his time has not been thrown away.

jTTF the art of dishin!:^ up nicely the remains of cold meat, 
Uf fish, and vegetables, were more closely studied than 
it is, the fair chatelaine would not look upon cold 
mutton, cold beef, &c;, with the feelings of despair that I 
fear too often possess her-, there would be much less 
wastefulness, and our breakfast and luncheon tables would 
be far more easily supplied than they are. Has not- some 
thrifty professor of kitchen lore actually dedicated a little 
book to the mysteries of cooking cold mutton, and how to 
penetrate them ? I have never seen the work, but, without 
boasting, I think I could fill a couple of chapters myself 
upon a similar theme. 

The mistake most of us make is one on the side of same- 
ness. AVe pick up a tasty recipe for warming up fish, a 
cunning method of treating cold vegetables, or a marvel- 
lously good M-rinkle about a hash, and ring the changes on 
our small stock of knowledge ad nauseam. The most ar- 
tistic rechauffe will lose its charm if repeated too often, and 
the appetite, — especially the Anglo -Indian appetite — soon 
tii'es of a flavour too frequently offered it. There is no 
fault that a native cook is more likely to acquire than this, 
so we should take pains to remove from his control mate- 
rials which are likely to minister to his failing. Let all 



RECHAUFFES. 169 



your pungent sauces, and essences, be kept under lock and 
key, and give out, from time to time, tlie doles that are 
necessary for delicate flavouring. If you do tliis, your 
hashes will cease to be slices of meat, cooked up in hot 
water and Worcester sauce, thickened with flour ; neither 
will your minces, croquettes^ cassolettes^ <^"C-, be presented 
with a sauce similarly comjDOsed. 

There are certain hard and fast laws to be observed 
generally with regard to the treatment of cold meat, &c., 
which ought never to be forgotten. Let me enume- 
rate them : — 

1. Always cut off carefully all parts that have been 
hroionecl in the previous cooking, such as skin ^ &c . 

2. Use the trimmings, and all bones, assisted by any- 
thing you may have to spare, to make the strongest broth 
you can for your rechauffe. 

3. Be generous in your allowance of butter and eggs, 
and, if recommended in the recipe you are following, do 
not refuse a small modicum of cream. 

4. Never be without red- currant j elly , olives, an chovi es, 
gra ted che ese, grated^bread-crunibs (bottled), mushroom- 
ketchup, o^od vineg ar, bottled garden herbs, and a mild 
sauce like Harvey;. 

5. Try to maintain a little kitchen garden, in large 
pots, or boxes, containing English curled parsley, marjo- 
ram, thyme, garden-cress, and celery. The last need not 
be planted for its root's sake, the leaves and stalks provide 
the cook with his flavouring agent, 

6. Teach your cook that meat that has been once cook- ' / 
ed, does not require to be boiled or stewed de novo. Des- 
cribe a hash or a mince to him as meat gently warmed u]i 
in gravy or sauce separately made to receive it. 

You must now turn back to Chapter X in which I tried 
t-o explain the fundamental principles of sauce-making. 

15 



170 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

The success of the recliaufe wholly depends upon the care 
bestowed upon the composition of the sauce in which it is 
heated up ; or by which it is enriched and diluted. This 
maxim holds good no matter what your dish may be : the 
hash, the salmis, the mince, the croquette, croustade, casso- 
lette, little patty, hramo2isK-ij, ^'c, cjr., all lean upon their 
a^ Espagnole or veloute as the case may be. 

Cold fish of any kind gives us valuable material for 
little breakfast dishes. Fairly large slices of firm fish, not 
overboiled in the first instance, may be advantageously 
warmed up whole, au gratin, or in a nicely-made white or 
brown sauce flavoured according to taste, and accompanied 
by pieces of cooked cucumber, or vegetable marrow. But 
if at all broken up, it is better to serve cold fish en caisses, 
or en corpdlles, or to work it up into croquettes or crous- 
tades. Broken fragments of cold fish are very nice when 
added to, and tossed about with, a goodly allowance of 
" buttered-egg." This can be served on toasts, or poured 
out upon a silver dish. A colouring of tomato sauce is an 
improvement. 

Another tasteful way of serving cold fish is to cut it 
into small pieces, like a coarse mince, and toss it about in 
a hot sauce-pan containing some previously boiled, hot 
maccaroni, stirring in with it a bountiful supply of melted 
butter, and a little tomato -puree (or sauce) ; when the con- 
tents of the sauce-pan are thoroughly well heated, turn 
them out on a very hot dish, and serve at once. This can, 
of coui'se, be composed upon a charcoal fire in the veran- 
dah, hard by the dining-room door. Gentlemen, whose 
appetites require stimulating, may fancy some chopped 
green chilli, some cayenne or Nepaul pepper, or a few 
drops of " Tabasco ;" but, to my mind, the dish is better 
without a suspicion of the evil one. 

Cold fish is almost invariably presented to you by Ra- 
masamy in the form of what he is pleased to call " fish- 



RECHAUFFES. 171 



pudding." This is sometimes nice, and sometimes very 
nasty. To be nice, a good deal of butter {good butter 
please, not four-annas-a-cup-composition, — " I beg your 
pardon,") is necessary with, the mashed potato, with a little 
cream, or some fresh milk helped up with the yolk of an 
Q^g, and a few drops of anchovy sauce ; Ramasamy being 
at the same time entreated not to make the mould into a 
pretty pattern with quarters of hard-boiled egg, &c., an 
effect which cannot be achieved without free use of his 
finger and thumb. " Twice-laid," as this dish is called at 
Home, cannot be sent up better than in a simiole mould 
like mashed potato, streaked with a fork outside, and 
baked till it takes a pale brown tint. Chopped hard- 
boiled egg may be stirred into the fish and potatoes with 
advantage. 

The hest fish pudding is that made of pieces of cooked 
fish steamed in a savoury custard. This is turned out like 
a pudding, and served with any nice fish sauce. 

Kegeree (kitchri) of the English type is composed of 
boiled rice, chopped hard-boiled egg, cold minced fish, and 
a lump of fresh butter : these are all tossed together in 
the frying-pan, flavoured with pepper, salt, and any minced 
garden herb such as cress, parsley, or marjoram, and served 
smoking hot. 

If your cook be a good hand at puff-pastry, you may 
have worse fare at luncheon than petits pates of minced 
fish. The salpicon must be diluted with a rich sauce, and 
flavoured with whatever herb you like best. A far-off- 
thought of celery is not to be despised. 

For the sauce in which you mean to re-cook fish, do 
not forget the bones and trimmings. A broth made of 
fish bones, with a few pepper corns, a sliced sweet onion, 
a bit of celery, a piece of lime peel, and an anchovy instead 
of salt, yields you a capital liquid which, when strained 



172 CULINARY JOTTIXGS FOR MADRAS. 

and -worked up -VN'itli melted butter and flour, generally 
produces a favourable impression. 

The chief features to be noted in cooking hashes and 

MINCES are much the same. Pi^pare the meat, after having 

carefully cut off all browned parts, as you may desire. 

[Make the best broth you can with the tinmming-s and 

I bones ; if you have any stock or gi'avy so much the better ; 

j thicken slightly, and flavour this according to your taste, 

and the mateHals that may be within your reach ,- strain it 

if necessary, add a dessert-spoonful of Madeira, or Marsala, 

[and thc-n warm up your meat. A mince, or a hash, should 

,'be allowed to stand in its sauce, with a geiitlc jieat under 

the sauce-pan, for as long a time as can be allowed ; when 

rcrpiired for the table, increase the heat, a nd the momen t 

( fjicjuirfa^e_stc(uns^ the di.sli is ready for service. 

" Bnt," says the inquisitive disciple, " what are you to do 
\i 3'ou have no bones, no gi'avy, and no stock ?" to him 
I reply as follows : — After having trimmed the meat to 
your fancy, take all the skin and ugly fragments that 
remain, and place them on a separate plate. Now, choose 
a Bombay onion, and mince it fine ; place a good sized 
sauce-pan on the fire, put a pat of butter at the bottom of 
it (say a couple of ounces if you can spare as much) melt 
it, throw in the minced onion, fry it a light golden broAvn, 
add hot water now gradually, and throw in your scraps of 
meat, six pepper corns, a tea-sjioonful of sugar, a tea- 
spoonful of salt, an anchovy, a piece of celery or its leaves, 
a carrot cut up, a bunch of curly paisley, the peel of a 
lime, and a table-spoonful of mushroom ketchup, with ji 
dessert-spoonful of vinegar, and let the contents of your 
sauce-pan simmer away until you are satisfied that you 
have extracted all the good to be got out of your several 
ingredients. Taste the broth as it is cooking, and correct 
any errors that may occur to you on the spot : when ready, 
strain it into a bowl, and skim off any fat that may rise. 



RECHAUFFES. 173 



Xow, take another sauce-pan, and go tlirougli tlie usual 
process of thickening the broth ; it will then be ready to 
receive the meat you desire to re-cook. A table-spoonful 
of Madeira, or Marsala ; a little red cui^ant jelly, and port- 
wine ; some claret or burgundy if at hand ; the pulp of a 
couple of tomatoes ; or the strained yolks of two eggs, may 
be added to enrich your_pZa;^. The egg should be stirred 
in after the sauce-pan has been removed from the fire. 
The tomato gives a piquancy to all hashes, and minces, 
superior to that which can be procured by vinegars. Your 
selection of the wine that you use must depend, of course, 
upon the sort of meat you are cooking up. 

In the case of a mince, remember, that when the meat 
has been passed through the machine, it must be diluted 
with a good thick sauce, in which it should be gently 
heated. Just before serving, it may be enriched with the 
raw yolks of a couple eggs — off the fire. 

Having done this, you can diversify the methods of 
serving it as follows : — 

1. Make a light o?neZei^fe. When all but ready to serve, 
spread your mince quickly on top of the omelette, toss the 
omelette in the pan lightly, and roll it oif into the hot dish, 
enveloping the mince, and serve. This must not look like 
a " roly-poly" pudding. The omelette should not be made 
as stilf as a batter dumpling as Ramasamy loves to serve 
it. I will tell you how to make an omelette, properly in 
my next chapter. 

2- Make a case of mashed potato, with high sides like 
a vol-an-vent case, and pour your mince into it. 

3. Hollow out a number of small dinner rolls, butter 
them, and fry them a golden yellow : pour your mince 
into them, put a curl of fried bacon on the top of each, 
keat them in the oven for five minutes, and serve. 



1 74 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

4. Make a number of little potato cases, and fill them 
in the same way : or if yon have tliem, nse the paper or 
china cases so universally used in England now. 

5. Make some light puff-paste, form it into patties like 
oyster patty pastry, bake, fill them when ready with the 
mince, heat thoroughly, and serve. 

6. Or, — cut the paste in circles three inches in, diame- 
ter, place a dessert-spoonful of the mince in the centre of 
each, fold them over, pinch the edges all round, and fry a 
golden yellow in a bath of boiling fat. 

7. Serve it plain, on a hot dish, garnished with sippets 
oi fried bread, fried curls of bacon, and slices of lime, and 
put a poached c^g or two on the top of it. 

With reference to the above, remember, that toasted 
bread is not fried bread. Ramasamy is apt not to distin- 
guish very carefully between the two ; and whereas n 
crisp piece of fried bread is an agi-eeablc adjunct to certain 
dishes ; sodden, slightly smoked toast is inexpressibly dis- 
agreeable anywhere. 

Bacon is valuable with all rechavfes of meat, and 
poached eggs are acceptable with hashes, and minces. 
Ham, I need scarcely say, if on hand, can be turned to the 
very best account, and tongue also, for that matter, to 
assist the flavouring of minces, croq^iettes, rissoles, et hoc 
genus omne. 

^Minced ham or tongue with minced corned beef, mashed 
up with some well boiled potatoes, hard boiled egg, and 
plenty of melted butter, and cooked in the fashion of 
" twice-laid," is a nice dish for a change at breakfast. 

Maccaroni, and dustings of Parmesan (or any mild 
grated cheese) vary the monotony of warmed-up meats 
immensely, and go well with nearly every cold vegetable. 
Try this sometimes : — Having made a really good ivhite

sauce, lay your trimmed fillets of cold fish, rabbit, or 
chicken, in a shallow pie-dish upon a layer of maccaroni, 
previously boiled till tender, pour the sauce over all, gar- 
nish with slices of tomato, dust over all a dressing of 
grated cheese, bake till lightly browned, and serve. The 
same recipe is practicable with brown meats, only make 
a brown sauce to start with, instead of a white. 

Batter plays its part effectively amongst recliauffes. 
Any nice mince, boimd with egg, rolled in slices of coolied 
bacon, then dipped in batter and fried in lots of fat, 
presents a toothsome kramousliy. Fish fillets, dipped in 
the same way, and fried, are nice ; and so are fillets of 
rabbit, or chicken. 

If not overdone, thick slices of tender beef, or of mutton, 
may be dipped in melted butter, and broiled over a fast 
charcoal fire; or they may be marinaded (vide page 65). 
then bread-crumbed with nice stale crumbs, and fried a 
golden brown. These served with a macedoine de legumes, 
sauce souhise, horse radish sauce, tomato, or tartare are 
delicious ; but the meat must be really juicy, or, in plainer 
terms, must have been slightly underdone in the first 
instance. 

Apropos of batter, I must not forget to say, that pounded 
fish, incorporated with batter, that is to say, worked into 
it, and fried in seething fat by dropping the mixture into 
the pan by spoonfuls at a time, produces a dish of fritters 
most welcome at breakfast alone, or capital as a garnish 
for a larger dish of fish. 

A remarkably nice little dish, also contrived with batter, 
is the crepe de poisson, or indeed of anything. The crepe 
is a pancake. Picture to yourself a nicely-made thin 
pancake : — spread it out upon a fiat dish, and cut it into 
pieces two inches wide, and three inches long. Upon the 
surface of each piece, place a thin slice of bacon slightly 



176 CULIXARY JOTTL\GS FOR MADRAS. 

smaller eacli way than the crepe, over the bacon put a table- 
spoonfnl of any nice mince, well worked with an egg 
or two, and a little cold sauce to give it moisture and 
cohesion : then roll up your crepes, put them on a buttered 
tin, brush them with a whipped egg, bread-crumb them, 
and bake brown in the oven. 

Cold vegetables, such as cauliflowers, cabbage, Jeru- 
salem artichokes, and vegetable marrows, may be mashed 
up with potatoes, or alone, diluted with melted buttci-, 
cream, or milk with the yolk of an egg strained into it, 
dusted over with grated cheese, and cooked aii gratin. 
Mixed vegetables may be cut into dice and warmed up in 
white sauce a la macedoine de legumes, and cold peas, cauli- 
flower, French beans, and cabbage, may be tossed in butter 
in a frying-pan, and served a la mail re dlwtel. You will 
find a good m.any recipes for the treatment of cooked vege- 
tables in the chapters I have devoted to that especial 
subject. 

No more useful present could well be given to a young 
lady commencing house-keeping than a set of silver, or 
silver-plated coquilles (scallop shells). Served in these in- 
viting looking little dishes, a mince, or a rechauffe of vege- 
tables, is worthy of a place at any table. A puree of arti- 
choke, capped with finely-grated cheese, any cold fish, 
minced game, even the remains of a maccaroni au gratin, 
sent up in this tasty manner, seem ever so much nicer 
than in an ordinary way. The shells should be well 
buttered before operations are commenced, and the mince 
or chopped vegetable should be well diluted with sauce to 
keep it nice and moist. The surface should be sprinkled 
over with cheese or finely rasped crumbs. When quite 
hot, brown the crumbs with a hot iron salamander-fashion, 
and serve the shells tastily on a napkin. Crisply fried 
curly parsley may garnish them.

The Savoury Omelette. 

iREATHES there a man with soul so dead" that 
he can read the great Brillat Savarm's account 
of the Cure's omelette unmoved ? Short as the 
little storj is, jou feel yourself absolutely at table with 
the worthy padre, — a man of culture, and refinement. It 
is Friday, and the little banquet is kept strictly within 
the canons of the Church, yet there is an artist's hand 
apparent in its subtle simplicity. The fish soup, the 
trout, the omelette, the salad, the cheese, and dessert ; the 
snowy cloth, the choice china, and the " old wine which 
sparkled in a crystal decanter," tell us plainly that science, 
and good taste, can make even a fast enjoyable. But 
amongst all the daintiness that marks the little banquet, 
that omelette is undoubtedly the prominent feature. You 
can see it, you can smell it, you can almost taste it. 

Xow, there is something cheering in this little chapter. 
We can throw ourselves back in our long arm-chair, and, 
with half closed eyes, make that very omelette, here in India. 
Or one so like it, that we need hardly lament our inability 
to procui^e carp's roes. This I hope presently to show you. 
There is another source of satisfaction in our musing, and 
that is, that with moderate forethought we ought never to 
be unable to make a g'ood savoury omelette, whether in 
camp, at a traveller's bungalo-^v, at a picnic, or in the privacy 



178 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

of our back verandali in cantonment. Eggs, tliougli 
neither as clieap, nor as plentiful as in days of yore, are 
still to be got : we can obtain cliarcoal, and a broken 
chatty to hold it : Ave can get an iron o»ieZe^^e-pan, made 
to order, in the bazar : we need never be without a tin 
of " Normandy," " Denmark," or " cow brand" butter : 
or, failing that, a bottle of the best salad oil. Salt, pepper, 
and a bottle of di-ied parsley ought not to be beyond our 
I'cach, and an onion is not an exjiensive luxury. Thus 
provided, we ought to be in a position to turn out a 
capital dish, very rapidly, at any time, and anywhere. 

Omelettes, as you all know, can be diversified ad libitum : 
we need never, therefore, be afraid of falling back upon 
them. 

Before I proceed to the discussion of omeZe^^e-making, 
however, let me point out that Ramasamy has been 
led astray altogether witli regard to this branch of his 
art. He sends you up a very nice pudding, symmetri- 
cal in design, of a goodly consistency, and of a rich brown 
colour. You almost require a dessert-knife to help it. It 
is, of course, lighter somewhat, than a * roly-poly' pudding 
made of paste, but it greatly resembles that homely com- 
position. It is a first cousin of the pancake, and Rama- 
samy evidently uses the stuff of which it is made to coat 
his plantains when bidden to make fritters. He starts 
wrongly to commence with, when mixing his omelette. 
In addition to the eggs (the whites of which he whips 
separately) he puts in a little flour, some milk or a little 
water, and, in point of fact, makes a lightish sort of 
hatter. This, I regret to say, ho vigorously whips, and 
fries in a fair amount of ghee, folding it into shape, and 
keeping it on the fire till it is nice and firm, and colom^ed 
as I before described. That this is no more an omelette 
than our old friend " the man in the moon" I need hardly 
assure you. Native cooks are nevertheless very easily 



THE SA VO UR Y OMELETTE. 1 7 9 

taught how to make one properly, and rarely fail after a 
patient exemplification of the correct method. 

I must confess that with the exception of " the Cure's 
omelette" previously alluded to, I never picked up a 
wrinkle concerning this excellent dish from a book. I 
have never come across a dissertation on oj)<eZef/e-making 
which seemed to have been written by a man who had 
viade one himself. The manner in which I learnt, the little 
I know on the subject was as follows : — I was marching 
with a Regiment from Bangalore to Secunderabad. At a 
place called Pennaconda, in the Bellary District, I was 
most hospitably entertained by a Member of the Madras 
Civil Service. Though so far away from any civilized 
place, the dinner placed before me in the quondam public 
bungalow in which my host resided might have graced a 
^etit tahle in the stranger's room of a London Club. His 
breakfast was an equally artistic meal, and was concluded 
by an omelette, — made on the spot, — by my accomplished 
friend himself. If this imperfect essay happen to catch 
his eye, he will, I am sure, forgive the honest tribute of 
his grateful pupil. Calling for a slop-basin, he broke into 
it four ordinary country fowl's eggs whole, and added the 
yolks only of two more. He thus had six yolks, and four 
whites. These he thoroughly mixed by using two forks : 
he did not heat them at all. When thoroughly satisfied 
that incorporation had been effected, he flavoured the mix- 
ture with a salt-spoonful of salt, a tea-spoonful of very 
finely minced shallot, a heaped up table-spoonful of minced 
curly parsley (grown in his garden) and — to crown all — a 
table-spoonful of really rich cream. He stirred this for a 
minute, and, as far as its first stage was concerned, the 
omelette was ready. We now left the dining-room for the 
verandah where there was a good charcoal fire in an iron 
brasier, (a half chatty would have sufficed of course) and 
upon it a pan about ten inches in diameter, very shallow, 



180 CULINARY JOTTIXGS FOR MADRAS. 

with a narrow rim well sloped outwards. A pat of butter 
was melted in the pan, sufficient in quantity to thoroughly 
Uibrieate the whole of its surface, and leave a coating of 
nioistm^e about an eighth of an inch deep over all. As soon 
as ready, quite burning hot, — the butter having ceased to 
splutter, and beginning to brown, — with one good stir 
round, the mixture was poured into the pan. At the 
moment of contact, the underpart of omelette formed, this ^ 
was instantly lifted by the spoon, and the unformed por- 
tion allowed to run beneath it ; the left hand, holding the I 
pan, and playing it, as it were, from side to side : With 
one good shake, the pan (in less than a minute from the time 
of commencing operations) was lifted from the fire, and its 
contents rolled off into the hot silver dish at hand to receive 
it, in which a little melted butter, with some minced parsley 
and shallot, had been prepared. The omelette, as it rolled 
of its own accord from the pan, caught up, and buried 
within it, the slightly unformed juicy part of the mixture 
which still remained on the surface ; and, as it lay in the . 
dish, was without any special shape, of a golden yellow 
colour, flecked with green, with the juicy part escapinL" 
from beneath its folds. 

An omelette ought never to be stiff enough to retain a 
rolled-up appearance. Being so rapidly cooked," it ought 
to be too light to present a fixed form, and, on reaching 
the hot dish, should spread itself rather, on account of its 
very frothiness. Books that counsel you to tur7i an omelette, 
to fold it, to let it brown on one side, to let it fry for about 
five minutes, &c., are not to be trusted. If you follow such 
advice, you will only produce, at best, an egg pudding. 

Timed by the seconds hand of a watch an omelette of 
six eggs, cooked as I have described, took forty-five seconds 
from the moment of being poured into the pan to that of 
being turned into the dish. 

The omelette we have just discussed is that generally 



I 



I 



THE SA VO UR Y OMELETTE. 1 8 1 

known as " aux fines lierhes^^ : — tlie ordinary one is simply 
made of eggs flavoured with salt. Thongh. cream is an im- 
provement, it is not essential. I confess tliat I like a very 
little minced onion in all savoury omelettes, but tliis is a 
matter of taste, and where ladies are concerned, the 
fragrant bulb ought perhaps to be omitted. The general 
rules to be observed in omeZe^^e-making, then, may be thus 
summed up :— 

1. Use a proper utensil, with narrow, well sloping 
sides 5 see that it is clean, and quite dry. 

2. Do not overdo the amount of butter, or salad oil, 
that you use for the frying. 

3. Mix, do not heat the eggs, and never use more than 
six as in the Pennaconda omelette. It is better to make 
two of six, than one of twelve eggs. 

4. Three eggs, mixed whole, make a nice sized omelette. 

5. Be sure that your pan is ready to receive your mix- 
ture. If not hot enough, the omelette will be leathery, or 
you will have to mix it in the pan like " scrambled eggs" 
— (oeufs hrouilUs). 

6. The moment the butter ceases to fizz, and assumes a 
pale brown tint, the pan is ready. 

7. Instantly lift up the part of the omelette that sets at 
the moment of contact, and let the unformed mixture run 
under it ; repeat this if the pan be very full, keep the left 
hand at work with a gentle sea-saw motion to encourage 
rapidity in setting, give a finishing shake, and turn it into 
the hot dish before the whole of the mixture has quite set. 

8. The omelette will roll over of its own accord, if the 
sides of the pan be sloped as I have described : it will not 
require folding. 

9. Three quarters of a minute is ample time for the 

16 



182 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

whole operation, if the pan be properly hot when the mix- 
ture is poured into it. 

10. Have the hot dish close by the fire, so that you can 
turn the omelette into it instanter. A little melted butter, 
with some chopped parsley, may, with advantage, be put 
into the dish. 

It is above all things necessary to have a very brisk fire 
under the pan while the omelette is being cooked. A 
brasier filled with live charcoal is the best kind of fire, 
and the fan must be vigorously plied from the moment 
that the mixture is poured into the pan. 

As I said before, omelettes may be varied in many ways. 
If '' aux fines herbes," curly parsley and shallot are neces- 
sary ; minced marjoram or thyme, garden-cress (the com- 
panion, I mean, of mustard) or celery leaves, are agreeable, 
and many are fond of a spoonful of finely chopped green 
chilli, omitting the seeds of course. 

Chopped ham, chopped tongue, chopped bacon, and 
chopped corned beef are added to omelettes with good 
effect. The words " aic jambo7i,'' " an lard,'' " ati langne de 
hoeuf," ^'c, specify the addition. I have found it better to 
fry the minced ham, &c., independently, keeping it handy 
for addition to the omelette during the rolling over stage, 
as it goes into the dish. 

Cold cooked vegetables, cut up and tossed awhile in 
melted butter separately, may be thus added with success. 
I recommend pieces of the flower of the cauliflower, arti- 
choke bottoms cut into dice, or Jerusalem artichokes sliced, 
and cut up. Peas, the grains of Indian corn, chopped 
French beans, or the seeds of the bandecai or moringa pod 
are thus very pleasantly treated. In the case of an " omelette 
aux legumes,'" a dust of grated cheese gives a pleasing 
finishing touch when the omelette reposes in the hot dish. 

" Omelette aux tomates :" — Cut three or four ripe tomatoes 



I 



THE SAVOURY OMELETTE. 183 

into quarters, pick out the seeds, and let the watery juice 
run off. Cut a sweet onion into the thinnest slices possible. 
Melt a table-spoonful of butter in a small saucepan, cast 
into it the onion slices ; let them cook without browning ; 
then add the drained tomato quarters, pepper and salt ; 
toss the sauce-pan about till the tomatoes are cooked 
which will be in about ten minutes. Keep the mixture 
hot, and pour it over the surface of an ordinary omelette 
just as you are on the point of turning it out of the frying- 
pan. The omelette will roll over of its own accord envelop- 
ing the tomatoes within it as it passes into the dish. 

The " omelette au Parmesan'" (or any mild dry cheese) is a 
specialite, as simple as it is delicious. A table-spoonful of 
grated and finely sifted cheese to three ordinary eggs, salt 
and black pepper to taste, and a dessert-spoonful of rich 
cream, if possible, or new milk, compose the mixture. In- 
corporate the ingredients, and proceed as recorded in the 
previous directions. Remember that it should be served 
just before all the juicy mixture on the surface quite sets, 
so that there may be an exudation of creamy moisture in 
the dish, and don't forget to dust over the surface a canopy 
of gTated cheese. This must go from the fire to the plate, as 
it were. Delay in serving is hard on any or)ielette. 

And, now, we come to the Cure's piece de resistance, con- 
cerning which I spoke at the beginning of this chapter. 
The salient feature of this plat was the combination of 
tunny, and carp's roes by which it was flavoured. Half a 
slice of preserved tunny, and the soft roes of two herrings 
a la sardine very finely minced together, with a little 
shallot, and a dessert-spoonful of parsley, should be tossed 
in butter awhile, and then stirred into a basin containing 
six well mixed eggs. Cook the mixture as already 
explained, and turn it out, when ready, into a hot dish 
containing a little melted butter, a few drops of lime juice 
and some minced shallot, and parsley. If you cannot get 



184 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

preserved tunny, a piece of lax, or nicely tinned salmon 
will be found an agi-eeable substitute, and cod's roes will 
form a pleasant companion thereto. The Cure used fresh 
tunny, and fresh roes, but we may follow his recipe with 
preserved substitutes, if not too salt, and achieve a very 
fair result. 

Kippered seer-fish, made at home, with Madras fish-roe 
well soaked, ought to make a capital omelette of this kind. 
The seer-fish should be split, washed, and dried with a 
cloth ; salt, sugar, and lime-juice being well rubbed in 
immediately ; the next day the rubbing must be repeated, 
and the fish ai^tificially smoked by being hung over a fire 
constantly replenished with damp straw, &c. After this, 
it should be hung in the cook-room over the fire, and it 
will be ready for the table the third evening. If you can 
get fresh roe so much the better ; if not, Madras preserved 
roe, well soaked and boiled till tender, will be found an 
excellent substitute. 

Omelettes may be cooked aux fines herbes, served upon a 
bed of tomato puree, and dusted over with grated cheese. 
They may also be laid upon a puree of gi-een peas, or of 
spinach. They may be improved with minced game, and 
be associated effectively with mince of any kind. Chop- 
ped mushrooms or truffles (previously cooked, minced, and 
tossed in butter) are, of course, very delicious additions to 
them ; and oysters may be introduced in the same way. 
Savoury omelettes are sent up with rich Espagiiole, Peri- 
gueux, and Bechamel sauces, and may contain some finely 
minced kidney stewed in champagne. Almost all fish, 
prawns, lobster, &c., go well with them, and whether 
simple or elaborate, plain or rich, an omelette rarely fails, 
— if properly made, — to win appreciation, and be thank- 
fully accounted for.

— ^ — 
0/7 Luncheons. 

^UNCHEON is a meal so popular amongst Britons 

both at Home and abroad, that the humblest 

treatise on cooking would be incomplete without a 
chapter specially dedicated to it. There are luncheons 
large, and luncheons small. The former elaborate, very 
pleasant, and sociable, yet alas ! a little too alluring, and 
fatal in their eifects upon the appetite for the rest of the 
day. The latter more enjoyable perhaps than their more 
ostentatious connections, for they are reserved for a few 
intimate friends, but affording just as much temptation to 
kill dinner. 

At Madras we reserve our luncheon parties for the 
Sabbath, when the unfair sex has no official care away 
from home, and though few sit down to dinner on that 
day till nearly half past eight, the overwhelming recollec- 
tions of the midday feast have hardly had time to pass 
away. 

A far better meal for us all, — a very near relation of 
luncheon, — is the dejeuner a la fourchette of our French 
friends. Brillat Savarin's luncheon party, if yoTi remem- 
ber, assembled " at ten — military punctuality." At eleven 
o'clock we might bid our guests sit down, I think, without 
misgiving, and though we might invite them to breakfast, 
we could really give them a luncheon. I attended a party 



186 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

of tliis kind, not long ago, the complete success of which 
has encouraged me to advocate its adoption in supersession 
of luncheons at 2 p.m. The Frenchman takes his cafe au 
lait, with a roll, as we take our chota hazri, which slight 
refection carries him satisfactorily till eleven, or even 
twelve o'clock ; the dejeuner a la fourchette is then a sub- 
stantial meal. Cannot we, when there are no distracting 
office hours to think of, do likewise ? A breakfast party 
ends about the hour that luncheons begin. Both hosts and 
guests have, therefore, ample time to recover their appe- 
tites, and to indulge in a quiet afternoon's rest, before the 
evening drive, and dinner. 

A pleasant luncheon or breakfast party should possess 
the following characteristics : — a judiciously selected list 
of guests, a pi^ettily arranged table, a light yet artistic 
menu, with cups of claret, sauterne, hock, or chablis, iced 
ad libitum, and in no way spoilt by sugar. Liqueurs may 
be handed round to finish with, and the best coffee you 
can make should follow. In composing your menu, you 
should avoid adhering in any way to the order and style 
of a dinner. Thus, you must not give any soup at all, but 
lead off with oysters in their shells accompanied by brown 
bread and butter cut thin, limes cut into quarters, and 
vinegars and peppers of kinds. 

An old standing dish to commence a luncheon party 
used to be mulligatunny. If properly made, this soup is 
a meal in itself : there are so many condiments, spices, 
and highly flavoui^ed elements in its composition, — not to 
mention the concomitant ladleful of rice which custom 
decrees, — that he who partakes of it finds the delicate 
power of his palate vitiated, as far as the appreciation of 
any dainty plat that may follow is concerned, whilst the 
edge of his appetite is left unto him sorely blunted. So I 
say, reserve mulligatunny for your luncheon at home when 
alone, enjoy it thoroughly, rice and all, and — nothing more. 



A 



ON LUNCHEONS. 187 



Having discussed your oysters, some half dozen dishes 
or so may follow, carefully contrasted one with another, 
and by no means dinner-like in their order thus : — 

An antipasto of oysters, or olives aux michois. 

Fish fricaseed with cucumbers, orlys, or a mayonnaise. 

Fillets of beef piques with horse radish sauce or creme 

d'anchois, garnished with potato chips, 

or a dish of cotelettes a J a Be for me, a la sonhise, ^'c. 

Maccaroni a Vltalienne, or au jamhon. 

Cold galantine of hen turkey, or capon, delicately sliced, 

and handed round, with a salad. 

A Ceylon prawn curry swimming in creamy gravy, with 

pieces of vegetable marrow associated with it. 

A chaud-froid of snipes. 
Fruits in cream ; liqueur. 

This menu is obviously susceptible of the pruning knife. 
At least one of the dishes could easily be cut out, and 
cheese with " green butter," and hors d'ceuvres again, might 
follow the sweet dish. 

A really carefully executed mayonnaise is a grand lun- 
cheon dish, and a cauliflower, or any first class vegetable, 
au gratin is invariably acceptable. For a small luncheon 
party, after the oysters I would give a dish of fish, 
followed by a simple entree from class I, a cauliflower aii 
gratin, the galantine, a mayonnaise, a sweet, cheese, and 
hors d'ceuvres. In fact, if you disabuse your mind of dinner 
altogether, and compose a little menu of mixed dishes, in- 
troducing some slices of cold dressed meat about the mid- 
dle thereof, you cannot go far wrong. Spiced pressed beef, 
or corned hump, lamb and mint sauce, pigeon pie or game 
pie, or the galantine aforesaid, are the sort of dishes from 
which you can select your central effect. It not giving a 



188 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

mayonnaise, a salad ought certainly to accompany the coki 
meat, and potatoes artistically dressed may go round. 

Canapes form a delicious luncheon dish, void : — cut some 
slices of bread a quarter of an inch thick, and two inches 
long if heart-shaped, two inches in diameter if round, and 
two inches square if rectangular. Fry these a pale golden 
colour in butter, and set them on a dish to get cold. To 
complete the canape, first spread a layer of " green butter" 
over each piece of fried bread, upon that place a layer of 
prawn or lobster meat pounded with butter, and slightly 
seasoned with Nepaul pepper ; smooth this with a dessert- 
knife, place a leaf of lettuce (cut from the golden heart) 
upon the top of the prawn meat, and a piece of beetroot 
shaped with your cutter. Over each canape when thus 
prepared, and ])laced in the dish for serving, pour a dessert- 
spoonful of rich, thickly worked, mayonnaise sauce, iced. 
A little chopped olive, or chopped capers, or the two mixed, 
may be judiciously sprinkled over each cap of mayonnaise 
dressing. The dish should stand on ice before serving. 

Instead of prawn meat, you can use cold chicken, finely 
sliced or pounded, an atom of the divine truffle might then 
be added to each canape, and the thinnest slice of tongue 
might cover it.' Instead of lettuce, a few sprigs of the 
flower or cold cauliflower can be introduced, or any cold 
vegetable of a delicate kind, asparagus points to wit. 

Fish may be used in this fashion : — caviare, cod's roe, 
lobster, herring a la sardine, sardines, lax, preserved tunny, 
and anchovies. Fancy some neatly picked fillets of the 
last named fish, w^iped free from oil, and the skin and 
bones removed, reposing on the green butter ; over them 
a goodly sprinkling of sliced olives, then the lettuce leaf, 
&c., as previously described — " say, dost thou like the 
picture ?" 

lu houses ^vhere the cook can really master an omelette

properly, one with Parmesan laid upon a fricassee of cauli- 
flower flowers, or upon a 'puree de topinamhourSy or com- 
posed aux points cVasperges, aux tomates, or aux truffes, may 
safely form an item of the choicest luncheon bill of fare. 

Here is a pretty little recipe for a Jilet de hoeuf cl 
Vltalienne which, to my mind, is worthy of attention, and 
well adapted for a mid-day festival. Take a tender fillet 
of beef (the undercut of the sirloin if possible) preserve it 
whole after trimming it into shape ; make an incision in 
it lengthways, and insert therein a long strip of bacon, 
fat and lean in equal parts, previously rolled in a fines 
herbes mince composed of a table-spoonful each of finely 
chopped mushroom, and parsley, a dessert-spoonful of 
minced shallot, and some pepper : tie up the fillet now, 
carefully, with tape. Take a good slice of bacon, mince 
it very small with thyme, marjoram, lime peel, a clove of 
garlic, half a sweet onion and a carrot, shake this mix- 
ture in a little butter at the bottom of a stew-pan, and when 
it melts, place the fillet upon it, and turn it gently till it 
browns nicely. N'ow, pour in a pint of tomato puree 
diluted with beef gravy to the consistency of ordinary pea- 
soup : simmer your fillet in this till it is done, it ought to 
be kept at least a couple of hours at a gentle heat : when 
ready to serve, strain off the sauce, place the fillet upon 
a very hot dish, remove the tape, garnish with glazed 
onions, haricots verts, Brussels sprouts, or any nice vegeta- 
ble, and pour a little of the sauce over it. Have ready 
some hot boiled, and drained maccaroni in a sauce-pan, 
empty all the sauce that remains amongst the maccaroni, 
shake into it a table-spoonful of finely grated cheese, toss 
the whole over the fire for a minute, and dish it separately 
in a very hot dish. Serve the two together immediately. 

Maccaroni, in the usual Italian fashion, is infinitely 
superior to our perpetual method of serving it. It makes 
an excellent luncheon dish. Boil the maccaroni in boiling 



190 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

water in a sauce-pan (which may be rubbed with a clove 
of garlic) until it is tender ; the moment it is tender, stop 
the boiling by adding a cup of cold water, if not, it will be 
sodden. Drain it carefully, as you do rice, and let it re- 
main in the hot sauce-pan. Now, stir into it a table- 
spoonful of the best fresh, or preserved butter (the new 
Denmark brand is quite first-rate) and as you work this 
about over the fire, an assistant should add by degrees a 
breakfast-cupful of fresh tomato pulp, a little salt and 
black pepper, and lastly, a heaped up table-spoonful of 
either grated Parmesan from the bottle, or any mild 
thoroughly powdered dry cheese : serve steaming hot 
without delay. The cheese should form long threads when 
lifted from the di.sh with the maccaroni. 

If you have any stock or consomme to spare, you can 
improve this dish by simmering the maccaroni therein 
after the draining stage. When the stock has been 
absorbed, add the tomato, &c. 

I could, of course, go on suggesting dishes, and describ- 
ing them ad infinitum^ — for luncheons are little banquets 
which afford enthusiastic cooks a pleasant field for the 
exercise of their inventive faculties. I will, however, 
conclude my chat about luncheon parties with a receipt 
for a mayonnaise sauce which has been communicated to 
me by the artist W. H. H. :— 

Put the yolks of three large, or four ordinary Indian 
eggs, (raw) in a flat joint dish with a tea-spoonful of salt, 
and the juice of two limes, and beat them well : tip the 
dish on end at an angle of about 35 ° , by slipping a thick 
book under the rim at one end. Open afresh bottle of 
salad oil, and get an assistant to let the oil fall, in rapidly 
succeeding drops, upon the centre of the dish, whilst you 
continue beating the egg mixture upwards to make it pass 
under the stream of dinpping oil. Half a pint of salad oil 



ON LUNCHEONS. 191 



I 



may be thus expended, and you will, by that time, have a 
sauce as thick as treacle, and of a golden yellow tint. 
Arrange your mayonnaise in its dish (W. H. H. recommends 
the juicy slices of a really well flavoured cold leg of mutton) 
shake a few drops of tarragon vinegar over it, with a dust 
of black pepper : arrange some well dried lettuce leaves, 
trimmed with a silver dessert knife, over the mayonnaise ; 
garnish as you like, with broken aspic jelly, gherkins, 
turned olives, capers, fillets of anchovy, balls of green or 
yellow butter, plain hard-boiled yolks of egg whole, &c., 
ice the sauce, and pour it over all. W. H. H. suggests 
that " grace" should follow. He is right. 

A few words must now be said regarding miscellaneous 
luncheons : — the office snacklet, the lunch in the train, or 
alfresco out shooting, the " tiffin" at home, a lady's morceau, 
and the mid-day meal of the convalescent. 

Place aux dames. This is the time when a lady may 
indulge in mulligatunny, or her favorite curry, with its 
chutneys, and relishes of which I treat later on. 

A chicken neatly cut up as for a curry, then dipped in 
bread-crumbs, fried a golden brown, and served with mac- 
caroni, and tomato, or with good bread-sauce and fried 
parsley. 

Perdrix att chou, or two partridges, boiled, and smothered 
in onions as rabbits are cooked in England. 

The undercut of the saddle, cut out entire, grilled over 
a brisk fire, and sent up with a potato duchesse : or a juicy 
neck chop similarly served, with a pat of maitre d'hotel 
butter melting over either of them. 

Braise a neck of mutton, or a breast, in gravy, with 
vegetables and some chopped bacon : slip a slice of bacon 
under the flap of either, and tie it in shape before you 
commence operations : when almost done, lift the little 
joint up ; strain off the gravy, skim it, and make a nice 



192 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS, 

sauce with it such as piquante, poivrade, or Italienne. Put 
tlie joint in the oven after bread-crumbing it, to brown 
and finish cooking ; when ready, dish it surrounded by 
boiled maccaroni over which the sauce should be poured at 
the last minute. Tomato pulp may be used for this pur- 
pose with marked effect, and some glazed turnips or carrots 
may garnish the dish, in which case the sauce should be 
served separately in a boat. 

A nicely roasted snipe, or pigeon harde, with potato 
chips. 

A single canape of prawn, or a little patty of puff-pastry 
filled with any tasty mixture. 

A savoury omelette, spinach on toast with " buttered- 
egg,'' or served with short-bread biscuits. 

A little plate of peas, tossed in butter with dice of fried 
ham or bacon. 

Coquilles of fish en rechaufe, or of any delicate vegetable. 

Indian com, boiled, stripped with a fork from the cob, 
tossed in melted butter, peppered, and salted, is generally 
liked ; see that the cob is quite a young one. 

A cheese fondue en caisse. 

From these dishes the luncheon of a lady or an invalid 
ought to be easily selected. 

Savoury toasts of all kinds, from the homely Welsh 
rarebit upwards, are welcome on the luncheon table. I 
treat of them, you will find, in exienso in a separate 
chapter. 

The office snacklet is, as a rule, a sandwich followed 
by a slice of cake. The former is susceptible of infinite 
variety : here are a few good ones : — 

Spread the bread with green or any fancy butter, and 
fill the sandwich with chopped sardines, and some bits of 



ON LUNCHEONS. 193 



pickle here and there ; or with mixed chicken and tongue, 
a lettuce leaf and some mayonnaise sauce. 

Any potted meat worked up with butter, pepper, a touch 
of mustard, and a little chutney. 

Ham and beef sandwiches should make your nose tingle 
with mustard : be easy with the butter if you can dot in 
some nice pieces of fat. 

Pound a slice of cheese well, with a little fresh butter, a 
tea-spoonful of made mustard, a little black pepper, and 
salt, add an anchovy, well wiped free from oil, and passed 
through the sieve with a little butter if too thick, mix 
thoroughly, give it a dust of Nepaul pepper, spread it on 
your bread, and complete the sandwich. This is for one 
large, or two small ones remember, so cut your cheese 
accordingly. 

Hard-boiled eggs work up well for sandwiches, and 
may be either used plainly pounded with butter with a 
seasoning of pepper and salt, or added to other ingredients 
like chopped tongue, ham, or corned beef. 

Fillets of anchovy with slices of olive, embedded in 
pounded hard-boiled egg and butter, and lightly dusted 
with Xepaul pepper, compose a very eatable sandwich. 

I am especially fond of a lunch-let composed of one 
home-made roll, a small piece of Gruyere, and two ripe 
plantains, but the taste of eating cheese with fruit is, I 
fear, un-English. 

The traveller's luncheon basket, and that of the sports- 
man are analogous. A friend of mine with whom I used 
to walk the paddy fields, adopted the plan of taking out 
a digester pot, previously filled with stewed steak and 
oysters, or some equally toothsome stew. This he trusted 
to his syce, who lit a fire somewhere or other, in the 
marvellous way the natives of this country do, and, as 

17 



194 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

sare as there are fish in the sea, had the contents of the 
pot steaming hot, at the exact spot, and at the veiy 
moment we required it. He was a bow-legged veteran, 
this sjce, and a most trusty varlet. I almost think 
though, that our shooting became a little erratic after our 
stew, which was bountiful in quantity, rich in quality, 
and provocative of beer, of whisky and water, or brandy 
and soda, according to oui' supply thereof. 

A good cold lunch is the best for the open air, when 
work must follow. When I was going through the course 
of Garrison instruction, and accustomed to long days out 
surveying, I was partial to a qalantlne made of a small 
fowl, boned and rolled, with a block of tongue and some 
forcemeat introduced in the centre of it. A home-made 
brawn of tongue, a part of an ox head, and sheep's trotters, 
well seasoned, and slightly spiced, was another specialite. 

A nice piece of the brisket of beef salted and spiced, 
boiled, placed under a weight, and then trimmed into a 
neat shape (the trimmings come in for sandwiches, potted- 
meat, or " bubble and squeak") is a very handy thing for 
the tiffin basket ; and a much respected patron of mine 
recommends for travelling, a really good cold plum pudding 
in which a glass of brandy has been included. 

Cake is acceptable at every kind of luncheon ; in fact, 
cakes were invented for that meal, for 5 o'clock tea, 
weddings, and for school-boys only.

Fritters. 



^p~^ AILURE in the accomplishment of the many excel- 
^JliS^ lent dishes which come nnder the head of " fritters" 
may be fairly attributed to three things : the first, 
ignorance in making the batter ; the second, a wrongly 
shaped utensil ; and the third, an insufficient use of the 
frying medium. If you once master these cardinal points, 
and can drum them into the head of your Ramasamy, you 
will have at your command a tasty and, indeed, artistic 
method of cookery upon which you can always rely with 
confidence. The charm of fritter cooking is its simplicity. 
The mixing of a good batter merely depends upon the 
accurate following of the recipe before you, whilst the 
culinary operation itself presents no difficulty whatever, 
provided a liberal supply of fat be given out, and the 
vessel used be a proper one. The beginner, as a rule, 
overcomes this part of his education after a few trials, and 
thenceforward has no apprehension concerning success. 

Tasty fritters, sweet, as well as savoury, can be made 
with vegetables, and fruit ; fish, both fresh, and cooked ; 
remains of cold meats, pounded cheese, and lastly, by 
batter, pure, and unassisted, in the form of " beignets 
souffles,'' ^"c. 

As the main point in this kind of frying consists in 
providing a bath of fat for the thing-to-be-cooked, it 



196 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

is essential that we should choose a deep, rather than a 
broad and shallow vessel, for the operation. The ordinary 
frying-pan sold at hard-ware shops is of no use what- 
ever for this branch of the cook's work. The pan you 
want should look like a stew-pan with double handles, and 
its sides cut down half-way ; its diameter need not exceed 
eight or nine inches. It may be as heavy as you like, for 
it must, of necessity, be kept steady over the fire when in 
use. A handle like that of an o»/eZ(?^^e-pan is therefore 
unnecessary, for you never require to shake a/nVz^re-pan. 

Opinions differ as to the best frying medium. The great 
Careme advocated the use of the fat skimmed from the 
surface of the pot-au-feu after having been carefully 
strained through muslin. Clarified suet, for which I give 
directions in ray chapter on pastry, is favorably regarded 
by GoufFe. Butter is hardly to be recommended for this 
kind of frying as it heats very quickly and is apt to burn. 
Oil is, of coui'se, an excellent medium, but it is difficult to 
get good out in India, and too expensive. Lard (imported) 
may be used, but I do not like it even in England for it 
always adheres to a certain extent to the thing fried. 
Good Indian ghee made at home, or procured fresh and 
then clarified as recommended for suet, is by no means to 
be despised j that sold on the Neilgherries is, as a rule, 
excellent. 

Besides your pan, for delicate fritter work there is 
nothing more useful than the wire frying-basket, — a cheap 
thing enough, and not hard to make. Pi^ovided with this 
utensil, which may be described as an open-ioorlc, draining- 
pan, slightly smaller in diameter than the y>iV?e re-pan, the 
whole process of working may be thus described : — 

1. — Make your batter, to begin with, according to one 
of the receipts hereafter given, and place it in its bowl on 
one side, covered up from flies, dust, &c. 



FRITTERS. 197 



2. — Prepare your fish, meat, vegetable, frnit, or what- 
ever you are going to cook, and arrange the pieces on a flat 
dish, on a table handy, with the bowl of batter next to it. 

3. — Take your /niJ?tre-pan, see that it is thoroughly 
clean, and dry. 

4. — Set it on the griddle rest, over a good bright charcoal 
fire, and empty the fat, or whatever you use as a frying 
medium, into it bountifully. 

5. — When melted, the fat ought to be quite two inches 
deep. 

6. — Determine if the fat be hot enough by throwing a 
sippet of bread into it : if the sippet fizzes, and produces 
large air bubbles, the fritter bath is ready. 

7. — Now, dip your morsel-to-be-fried into the batter, 
which should be of sufiicient consistency to coat it nicely ; 
plunge the frying-basket into the fat, and slide the fritter 
into it. 

8. — The fritter must be covered by the fat, not partly in, 
and partly out of it. Fan the fire now vigorously. 

9. — Let it frizzle, and when of a rich golden tint, lift up 
the basket, and hold it a moment or two over the pan so 
that its contents may drain. 

10. — Lay each fritter, as you take it from the basket, on 
a dry clean cloth, or on a sheet of new blotting paper, to 
complete the draining. 

11. — When dry, dish it in a very hot dish, and, if a 
savoury fritter, give it a dust of finely powdered salt ; if a 
sweet one, shake a canopy of powdered loaf sugar over it. 

12. — Fritters can be fried one after another. Never put 
in more than the pan can easily hold at one time. 

The fat should now be poured through muslin into a 
clean bowl : it will harden, and be fit for work again, until 
it assumes a leaden tint, which may take place after it has 



198 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

been used two or three times. Fat in which /7s7^ has once 
been fried must be reserved afterwards for fish only, as it 
acquires a fishy taste. 

If you follow these rules closely, you ought never to fail 
to turn out nice fritters, provided, of course, that your 
batter be properly made. I cannot too strongly impress 
upon you the necessity of attention to this part of the 
work which so many cooks slur over carelessly. I have 
adopted as a standard batter in my own kitchen one re- 
commended by the " G. C," whose advice I have so often 
quoted in these pages. Friends who have tried it at my 
recommendation have generally commended it. You must 
proceed in this way : — 

Beat up the yolks of three cgfrs with two table-spoonfuls 
of brandy, one table-spoonful of the best salad oil, and 
four or five table-spoonfuls of cold water. Incorporate 
with this mixture three table-spoonfuls of flour and a salt- 
.spoonfnl of salt. The flour should be dry, and the best 
imported. Work this now, with care, to a smooth paste, 
and continue to beat it for at least ten minutes. If the 
batter appear too thick, add a little w^ater until its consist- 
ency be satisfactory, i.e. : — it should cover the spoon 
when lifted out of it with a coating about the eighth of an 
inch thick. This stage having been reached, take the 
whites of the three eggs, and whip them to a stiff froth : 
stir this into your batter at the time of using. 

This recipe may be reduced for a small dish of fritters 
as follows : — two ordinary eggs, one table-spoonful of 
brandy, a dessert-spoonful of salad oil, two or three table- 
spoonfuls of water, and one and a half table-spoonful of 
flour. For sweet fritters, use sugar instead of salt. 

Another good batter is made thus : — Beat up equal parts 
of salad oil, and brandy, — say, a table-spoonful of each ; 
add the yolk of au egg^ and incorporate with this, sufficient 



FRITTERS. 199 



flonr to make a thick paste, which you thin to the required 
consistency by the addition of water, reserving the whipped 
white of the egg to finish with. 

I have more than once alluded to " heignets^' in previous 
chapters, and receipts for several will be found amongst 
my menus. The hramoushy* is, I think, the prince of all 
savoury fritters, and is susceptible of being composed in 
many delicious ways. The oyster, pounded shell fish, 
minced fish of any kind, sweet-breads (when you can get 
them) or any delicately composed mince of fowl, or of 
meat, with tongue or ham, can be thus turned to an artistic 
account. Whatever your salpicon, or minced composition, 
may be made of, the spccdalites of the kramoushj are the 
little jacket of fat bacon in which it is enveloped, and the 
batter in which it is dipped. The bacon should be 
previously cooked, and cut into thin slices, two and a 
half inches long, and one and a half deep : two oysters, 
or a heaped up tea-spoonful of any salpicoyi, should be laid 
in the centre of each : the bacon must then be folded over 
it very neatly, and kept ready for the dipping process, 
which must be carried out cautiously. The frying should 
be conducted as already described. 

If you wish to make Jcramouskys of chicken, turkey, or 
game, you should mince the meat coarsely, the pieces being 
cut like little dice, bind the mince with the yolks of a 
couple of eggs or more, according to the quantity of the 
mince, and stir into it, in a sauce-pan on the fire, a little 
richly made veloute ; let this get quite cold, and firm, then 
divide it into little portions and fill your bacon slices. 
Minced truffles, and mushrooms, are, of course, undeniable 
improvements to any salpicon. 

* Generally written ' Kromeskv,' ' or crojnesqni.' I have adopted a 
different spellinj? having been assured by a friend whose authority is 
unimpeachable that the dish is of Russian origin, and its name " Kra- 
mousky." 



200 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

A fish kramouskij is easily accomplished : you need only 
mince the fish, stir into it, in a sauce-pan on the fire, a 
few spoonfuls of well made white sauce, add a little season- 
ing, with the yolk of an e^g when off the fire, and set it to 
cool. 

In like manner, tinned lobster, tinned oysters, and any 
tinned fish, can thus be successfully treated. In using 
them, however, it is necessary to wash, and drain them 
from the liquid of the tin. The sauce should be made 
very carefully, so that it may freshen up the fish as much 
as possible. 

An oyster, plainly dipped in the batter I have given 
you, and fried secundum artern^ is perhaps as dainty a 
morsel as can be presented to the jaded appetite of an 
Anglo-Indian. Drain the oysters from their liquor in the 
tin, wipe them, and set them, en marinade all the day in 
a soup plate, with the juice of three limes, an onion sliced 
some whole peppers, and a few cloves ; turn them occasion- 
ally till they are wanted for the friture-^an. Oyster 
fritters thus treated, form an excellent garnish, and may be 
served with boiled or fried fish, or a dish of filets de hceuf. 

Here is a super-excellent idea of the " G. C.'s" : — Split 
each oyster open, almost as wide, comparatively speaking, 
as you do a kidney, and insert therein a little of the fol- 
lowing composition : — toss on the fire in butter, with pep- 
per, salt and a spoonful of rich brown sauce, a dessert- 
spoonful each of minced mushroom, shallot, and truffle ; 
thicken this with the yolks of two eggs, give it the juice 
of a lime, and let it get cold. After putting a small allow- 
ance of this in each oyster, shut the sides together, dip it 
in the batter, and fry immediately. 

I have already indicated the vegetables which make 
good fritters, and here repeat my high opinion of that 
method of treating them, 



FI^ITTERS. 201 



Try this : — -pound a dish of boiled prawns in a mortar 
Avith some butter, and weak gravy ; when quite worked to 
a -puree, incorporate it loith the hatter, and drop the mixture 
by dessert-spoonfuls at a time, into your friture-^sin : let 
the fritters cook till they turn a rich golden colour, and 
are as crisp as biscuits, then drain, and serve them on a 
napkin, with crisply fried parsley. 

If you omit the prawn piiree, and simply fry spoonfuls 
of the plain batter, you will have heignets, or (as Rama- 
samy hath it) " pan-cake fritters," which may be either 
sent up as a savoury entremets, to be eaten with butter, 
pepper, and salt ; or as a sweet one, when they must be 
dusted over with powdered sugar, and sprinkled with lime 
juice. In the latter case, a spoonful of brandy or liqueur 
shaken over the fritters improves their general effect. 

All fruit fritters can be cooked in the batter I have de- 
scribed. Peaches, apricots, pears, and apples make deli- 
cious fritters, the pine- apple is equally amenable to the fri- 
f wre-pan ; whilst oranges and our lowly plantain are not to 
be despised. For the four former fruits we must look to the 
tin ; those that come to us from America are specially to 
be recommended. Pine-apples, when in season, can be 
procured in the market ; if out of season, the American 
tinned slices are capital substitutes. Oranges can be used 
in their season, and the plantain is a perennial friend. 
Whatever fruit be chosen, let it be set en marinade in 
liqueur, brandy, or rum. Delicate fruits require liqueur, 
the pine-apple is better associated with rum, the plantain 
and orange are thankful for either rum or brandy. A 
wineglass is enough. The fruit, sliced, and prepared for 
the " heignet,'" should be laid in a soup-plate, dusted over 
with sugar, and sprinkled with the brandy, or liqueur. 
After an hour, the slices should be turned over, basted 
again, and this should be repeated during the afternoon, 
until they are required by the cook, The brandy or 



202 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

liqueur you use for the marinade should be mixed in the 
batter. Orange quarters and slices of ripe plantain may 
be used raw, but the slices of pine-apple must be stewed 
till tender. 

I cannot do better than wind up this chapter with a 
recipe for heignets souffles : — 

" Put about a pint of water in a sauce-pan with a pinch 
of salt, a piece of butter the size of an egg, a table-spoon- 
ful of sugar, and the rasped peel of three lemons — when 
the whole boils, throw in gradually sufficient flour to form 
a thick paste, then let it remain ten minutes, and work 
into it, off the fire, two eggs complete, and the yolks only 
of two more, the whites of which you reserve for whisk- 
ing to a froth : add the froth, let it rest awhile, and then 
proceed to fry by dropping pieces of it the size of a walnut 
into boiling fat. The paste will swell in the process of 
frying, and if the fat be sufficiently heated hollow 
balls of a fine golden colour will be produced. Serve them 
piled upon a dish, with a plentiful dusting of powdered 
white sugar." (G. C.) 

In this country it will be better to use a few drops of 
lemon essence than the rasped peel of a lime ; and any 
essence, such as vanilla, ratafia, almond, &c., may be used 
as a change. 

If you omit the lemon and the sugar, and stir in with 
the flour a good allowance of finely grated Parmesan, you 
will achieve a " heignet souffle au Parmesan/' a truly tooth- 
some savoury entremets ; and if you cook them plainly, 
without cheese, and only seasoned with pepper and salt, 
you will have a beignet which, when eaten with salt, pepper, 
mustard, and fresh butter, forms a savoury entremets not 
to be despised.

Salads. 

tN an early chapter of these jottings, I observed that 
amongst the accessories of an artistic dinner, a good 
salad, though not entered in the menu perhaps, was 
still expected to be present. On the continent we find the 
salad handed to us, as a matter of course, with the 
" rot.'' " Pullet au cresso7i, — salade' is, of course, a familiar 
item in the French menu. This custom is being fast 
adopted in England by those who are quick to mark that 
which their neighbours do well. There can be no doubt 
whatever that this method of dressing raw vegetables, if 
correctly done, is wholesome, and a singularly commend- 
able staple of diet for people who live in hot climates. 
There are ailments to which the Englishman seems to be 
especially prone, which are comparatively unknown by 
Spaniards and Italians with whom raw vegetables, and oil 
are daily food. A careful study then, of what we can do 
in India in this branch of cookery, is worthy of every 
man's attention. 

We all know that a salad demands two things : — its 
vegetable foundation, and its dressing, both of which may 
be a good deal varied. 

First, as regards the foundation of a salad. This may 
be composed of cooked, as well as of raw materials : the 



204 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 



vegetables principally employed being, lettuces (cabbage, 
and coss), endive, tomatoes, onions, cucumbers, parsley, 
young radishes, garden-cress, and water-cress, in the latter 
condition; and in the former, beet-root, French beans, 
flageolets, potatoes, artichokes, cauliflower, turnip-tops, 
asparagus, cabbage, vegetable marrow, and young carrots. 
With cold cooked country vegetables, I have made capital 
salads ; young brinjals, the mollay-keeray, bandecai, coun- 
try beans, greens of sorts, and little pumpkins gathered 
very 3'oung, are all worthy of treatment in this way. 

Touching salad-dressing a gi'eat deal might be written, 
for concerning its composition cookery books seem to 
possess " a thousand several tongues," and every tongue 
to bring in " a several tale." Let us try and be con- 
tented, however, with a few standard ones, remembering 
that salads may be clothed in simplicity, as well as in 
grandeur. 

True co7inoisseHre, I think, adhere, as a rule, to the very 
simplest : that is to say, the simplest as far as the compo- 
nent parts, and the process of mixing them, are concerned. 
The artist's hand and eye, and some little experience to 
boot are, of course, essential to acquire that nicety of judg- 
ment of quantity which a plain dressing demands. It is, 
therefore, the hardest to describe. 

Let me lead off with one general law for every salad, of 
which English people are, collectively speaking, ignorant. 
It is this : — 

Abstain from the vinegar bottle as much as possible. 
You do not want an acid dish at all. Vinegar is merely 
added to lend a peculiar flavour to the composition, and to 
assist it with an almost imperceptible pungency. That 
most pernicious advice : — 

" Four times the spoon with oil of Lncca crown, 
And twice with vinegar procured from town" 



SALADS. 205 



should be shunned most studiously. The correct use of 
vinegar is, therefore, to my mind the feature which con- 
tains the main difficulty in mixing a salad. 

The following rules for plain salad-dressing may be 
trusted I think : — 

Pull the leaves of the lettuce from the stalk with your 
hand, rejecting all that are bruised and discoloured, turn 
those at all muddy into a basin, wash them well, and drain 
them thoroughly on a sieve, tossing them lightly in a cloth 
afterwards to get rid of every drop of water. Leaves that 
are quite clean ought not to be wetted at all. When dry, 
put the leaves into the bowl, and work them about with 
the wooden spoon and fork whilst an assistant sprinkles 
over them a libation of the finest oil you can buy. As soon 
as every leaf is thoroughly anointed, — glittering with a 
coating of moisture as it were, — shake over them a few 
drops of tarragon vinegar, and dust them with salt, and some 
coarse, freshly gTound black pepper. The spoon and fork 
must be kept going during the addition of the vinegar 
drops, and also whilst ^he pepper and salt are being dusted 
into the bowl. The thing to avoid is a sediment of dressing. 
The leaves lying at the bottom of the bowl must, in that 
case, become sodden, and so the crispness you desire to 
maintain will be marred. A thorough lubrication is all 
that has to be accomplished. I picked this up several 
years ago from a French waiter at Yerrey's dining-rooms 
in London : it was surprising how much oil was caught up 
by the dry crisp leaves, and how Utile vinegar was put in 
as a finishing touch by this accomplished Garqon. 

Observe, pray, that it is quite out of the question to 
give fixed quantities with regard to the mixing of this 
kind of salad. The quantity of oil, and of the other in- 
gredients, must obviously depend on the quantity of green 
stuff.

This is the only dressing possible in the ease of an endive 
(chicoree) salad ; for which it is essential that the bowl be 
rubbed with garlic. 

Very finely minced onion, curled parsley, and garden- 
cress may be sprinkled over the lettuce leaves after the 
oil has been worked into them, but for dinner parties per- 
haps the " violet" had better be omitted (valuable as it 
is) or its absence supplied by a drop or two of shallot 
vinegar. 

And this leads me to aromatic vinegars, " without 
which," to use the outfitters favourite form of advertise- 
ment, *' no salad-maker's equipment can be considered 
complete" : — 

1. — Tarragon Vinegar, 

2. — Anchovy Vinegar, 

3. — Shallot Vinegar, 

4. — Elder Vinegar, 

5. — Garlic Vinegar. 

These are all procurable at the shops of the leading 
preserved provision merchants at Madras, but the salad 
artist should maJie his own peculiar vinegars, and use them, 
according to judgment, to vary the too-often repeated 
flavours of ordinary compositions. Here are a few sugges- 
tions : — 

" Fines herhes vinegar" : — To half a pint of tarragon 
vinegar, add a table-spoonful of minced garden-cress, a 
table-spoonful of minced marjoram, a clove of garlic, two 
small green capsicums shred, and one minced shallot. 
Or : — To the same vinegar, add the finely-pared rind of 
three limes, a dozen cloves, a dozen pepper corns, and the 
same green herbs and onion. 

The bruised seed of garden-cress, celery, and parsley, in 
equal portions, — say a tea-spoonful of each, a clove of 



SALADS, 207 



garlic, and two ordinary capsicums finely minced, make, 
when added to half a pint of tarragon vinegar, an invalu- 
able element of salad dressing. 

In speaking of capsicums, I only allude to the skin, not 
to the pith or seeds. 

A very few drops of the strongly flavoured vinegars I 
have described are, of course, ample to " animate the 
bowl." A cook's ingenuity will aid him in concocting other 
varieties easily enough. When made, cork your bottle 
down tightly, seal it with wax, and set it in the sun, — an 
operation which presents but little difficulty in this country. 
In a week or two, you may strain the liquid, and take it 
into use. 

An excellent salad is that made by slicing raw ripe 
tomatoes, with a Bombay onion. The dressing given should 
be like that recommended for lettuce, only that, your al- 
lowance of oil must be abundant ; and, inasmuch as tomatoes 
are sweet, there may be a little freer use of the vinegar 
cruet. As in all salads, tarragon, or any aromatic vinegar, 
may be employed advantageously in this one, and minced 
fines herhes may be sprinkled over the whole. Strips of 
green capsicum harmonize most pleasantly with a tomato 
salad. This is obviously a dish for the sterner sex, and 
one which no man would partake of just before a ball, on 
his wedding day, or at all during the halcyon period which 
generally precedes that ceremony. ! why is our rose 
thus thornily encumbered ? Why was it ordained that 
man should never eat of the fragrant bulb without remem- 
bering it to his sorrow ? I once heard an amateur cook say 
that the forbidden fruit in the garden of Eden must have 
been an onion. " Hence," said he, " the curse it carries 
with it, and hence the universal dislike with which it 
is regarded by the ladies." But this man was a free 
thinker. 



208 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

The other form of salad dressing is closely connected with 
viayonnaise sauce, and has many admirers. With some 
vegetable ingredients it undoubtedly works better than its 
plainer relative. In England, however, it is almost always 
spoilt by being overdosed with vinegar, — common, acid 
stuff without any flavouring, — and in nearly every cookery 
book of the average capacity, you are told to mix oil and 
vinegar in equal 2'>arts, which I have already denounced. 
An old recipe called " Dr. Kitchener's salad mixture" 
embodies as many mistakes as could well be made in a 
dressing of this kind : — " two table-spoonfuls of oil, or 
melted butter (!) two or three table-spoonfuls of vinegar." 
The " poet's recipe" already alluded to is equally faulty. 
In point of fact, the part played by the vinegar in these 
dressings is really so small as regards measurement that 
a fixed amount can scarcely be laid down. In proportion 
to the oil, one-si.rth is to ray mind the outside allotment 
that should be given. This is a good every-day salad 
mixture : — 

Put the very-hard boiled yolks of two eggs into a slop 
basin, with a tea-spoonful of powdered mustard, a scant 
salt-spoonful of salt, a pinch of sugar, and a tea-spoonful of 
minced shallot. Bruise these with a wooden or silver 
spoon, and work them to a paste with a little salad oil. 
Add oil by degrees till your paste is about the consistency of 
batter, then toss into it one by one the raiu yollcs of three 
eggs, continue the working, and add oil, till you have a 
nice rich sauce coating the spoon pretty thickly : you can 
now dole out a dessert-spoonful of tarragon or other 
aromatic vinegar, and mix it thoroughly with the other 
ingredients : the sauce will become creamy the moment it 
receives the ^-inegar. Taste your sauce by dipping a leaf 
of lettuce into a spoonful of it, and finish it off, as regards 
further addition of oil or vinegar, according to discretion. 
The eye, and the palate are your surest guides : no true 



SALADS. 209 



salad-maker works by measure. As soon as jou have got 
a creamy, well-flavoured sauce to suit your fancy, strain 
it through the little block tin strainer to get rid of every 
lump, and the little bits of onion. This should be done 
over the sauce-boat, which should be put into the ice box 
as soon as it is filled. 

If yon want a thicJc sauce of this kind, lightly ^^<^ the oil 
with the raw eggs adding it by degrees, and the mixture 
will soon be stiff enough, especially if you put in another 
raw yolk. 

Use French mustard (moutard de maille) in preference 
to English. Never use Worcester sauce on any account 
whatever. 

N.B. — In all rich salad, or mayonnaise dressings, cream 
may be used instead of oil, or be added to a made sauce 
as a finishing touch. 

I recommend very strongly that the salad, nicely dressed 
in its bowl, and the icy-cold sauce in its boat, should b© 
preserved separately, and handed round together. If you 
mix a salad of this kind before dinner, and let it soak, 
it deteriorates considerably before the time comes for 
its service. Cover up your nicely selected well dried 
lettuce leaves, &c., and they will be crisp, if handed round 
with their sauce following them, on the arrival of " the 
roast." This advice holds good with mayonnaise. The 
meat or fish of which the dish may be composed becomes 
sodden, and dead, and the green accompaniments fall off in 
crispness if bathed in dressing. Besides, after the meal, a 
mixed mayonnaise or salad is wasted, whereas one with 
which the sauce was separately served may be turned to 
account. You have in the former case only to pick the 
meat out of the lettuce leaves, and place it on a separate 
dish. The plain salad I first mentioned must, of course, 
be mixed the very last thing before dinner, unless you can 



210 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

boldly rise from the table, and mix it yourself at the exact 
time that it is wanted. 

A salad of cold cooked vegetables (salade cuite) can be 
either served with plain, or rich dressing. For the finest 
of all see the recipe given elsewhere for salade Russe. 
Sliced potatoes, beetroot, French beans, and cucumber, go 
well together : while cauliflower and cabbage, both kinds 
of artichokes, and asparagus points, are admii^able with a 
plain sauce. 

vSalade ^a la ma XANTE is a combination of good things; 
which will commend itself at once to the appreciative 
reader : — Take six cold boiled or tinned fonds d'arttchauts, 
fill their hollows with cold boiled or tinned poififes 
d'aspergeSf cover the surface with cold sliced truffles that 
have been stewed in champagne or Madeira, and smother 
each di^esscd /o?/(Z with a rich mayonnaise dressing : — serve 
straight from the ice-box. This should, of course, be 
classed as an entremets. 

The country vegetables I have already alluded to are 
nice with ordinary salad sauce, or mayonnaise dressing. 
Choose very young brinjals, boil, and when cold, slice 
them ; bandecais may be plainly arranged in rows ; young 
pumpkins must be sliced, and greens should be slightly 
boiled and divined. Strips of anchovies, well wiped from 
their tin oil, may be slipped into these salads with satis- 
factoiy results. 

The bandecai. Hind : hhmdi, if gathered young and 
boiled till tender makes an excellent salad in this way : — 
aiTange the bandecais on a flat dish placed over some 
crushed ice. With a dessert-knife slit each one open 
longitudinally ; in the slit put a fillet of anchovy, and over 
all, pour a little iced salad dressing. 

The young shoots or stalks of molJay, Hind, choolaiie, 
boiled, drained, and cut up, make, when cold, a capital 



SALADS. 211 



salad : use a p lain oil and vinegar dressing, and toss some 
cliopped olives, onions, and a minced anchovy among the 
chopped stalks. 

Here is a noble recipe for a mayonnaise 'a la gouffe for 
which I have to thank a fair, and most accomplished artiste 
now in Madras : — 

In an oval, or round cylinder-mould placed in ice, pour a 
very little well made liquid aspic jelly ; as soon as it is all 
but set, dispose neatly therein a number of little balls of 
green butter, and prawn butter (q. v.) alternately, cover 
them with some more of the jelly, set them, and repeat 
the process in layers as it were until the mould is packed. 
You must ice the balls of butter before you put them in, 
and alternate them differently in each layer, so that the 
colours may be checkered. The mould can now be left in 
ice to consolidate thoroughly. When turned out, you can 
garnish it externally with balls of the same fancy butters^ 
turned olives, strips of anchovy, and hard-boiled yolks of 
egcr^ and pack its hollow centre with the fish, or fowl, of 
which youi" mayonnaise is composed. Lettuce leaves culled 
from the golden heart should crown the centre, and be 
arranged with some whole boiled prawns in their shells 
round the margin of the dish outside the mould. The 
mould of jelly and its sauce should be kept in the ice box 
till the nick of time before serving, when (in this case) 
the latter should be poured over the contents in the centre 
of the mould. For aspic jelly, vide Menu, No. 9. 

My up-country readers have only to make their fancy 
butter from tinned lobster meat, instead of prawns, to 
turn out just as grand a mayonnaise as this. For fancy 
butters, please follow me in the next chapter.

E must now consider those attractive accessories 

of an artistic dinner, luncheon, or breakfast 

party, which, under the title of hors iVceuvreg, 

arc gradually becoming popular amongst English people 

whose minds have expanded under the bcneticial iiitlucnc^e 

of travel in foreign countries. 

J7or.? tVcsnvres, as you all doubtless know, are little dain- 
ties, or kickshaws, carefully prepared, and tastefully serv- 
ed, which, on the continent, are offered to the diner to 
whet his appetite prior to the more important discussion 
of the banquet itself. In Italy the service of these trifles 
under the title of " nntipasto,'' precedes every meal as a 
standard custom. We have not yet acquired this agree- 
able fashion, notwithstanding that the sending around of 
three or four oysters to each guest, with a slice of brown 
bread and butter, &c., has for a long time, been no novelty 
either in England, or in Madras. Our custom, as a general 
rule, is to reserve the hors cVoeuvres to accompany the cheese, 
and to advocate a change would, I fear, be lost labour on 
the part of the author of these jottings. As far as lun- 
cheon, and breakfast parties are concerned, however, surely 
we might adopt the Italian custom as a novelty, and watch 
its effect upon our friends, before passing an opinion upon 
the suitability of the introduction ? 



HORS D'CEUVRES. 213 

Unlike the greater part of our culinary labours, this 
pretty item, of our menu need cost us but little trouble. We 
can obtain many excellent things wherewith to captivate 
the appetite, and we can make others which in their way 
are generally successful. Olives fargies^ olives plain, ancho- 
vies in oil, sardines, sliced Bologna sausage, preserve I 
tunny, lax, lobster, cod's roes, seer-fish roes, reindeer's 
tongues, ox tongue, devilled ham, potted meats, fancy 
butters, herrings d la sardine, pilchards in oil, caviare, 
oysters, pickles, cucumber, radishes, thin bread and butter, 
wafer biscuits, oaten biscuits, and last but not least " Bom- 
bay ducks," provide us with a goodly list from which to 
choose our tasty morsels. 

Hors d'oeuvres should be served in a dish divided into 
compartments. Tongue, sausages, and ham, should be 
most delicately sliced. Preserved fish should be very 
carefully wiped free from all tin-oil, and re-dressed with 
the finest salad oil : if of a large kind, small portions should 
be cut to suit the dish. Potted meats should be fresh, 
home-made, and prettily shaped in a cone. Caviare 
should be turned out of the tin, and garnished with 
quarters of lime. Fancy butters must be iced, and served 
separately. 

Sardines can be greatly improved by being treated as 
" Norwegian Anchovies." Open a tin of the best sardines, 
take the fish out one by one, and place them on a dish. 
Wipe them free from oil, carefully pick off their skins and 
divide each sardine in half lengthwise. Give the fillets 
thus obtained a dusting of white pepper. Now, take an 
oval earthenware pot, see that it is dry and clean, slice a 
Bombay onion up, and put a layer of the rings at the bot- 
tom of the pot, with a cinnamon leaf, and a pepper corn 
or two. Arrange over this a layer of sardine fillets, and 
continue the process until the pot is filled, or the fillets 
are exhausted. Pour over the layers a marinade of oil and 



214 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

vine<^ar (one spoonful of the latter to four of the former) 
and" in a few hours the sardines may be eaten. 

Sometimes sardines are too soft to fillet ; in that case be 
contented with skinning them only. 

Oysters, of course, are never sent round with the cheese. 
When they appear before dinner, send them up in their 
shells, and be quick with their accompaniments. You 
sometimes see a hungry man polish off his bivalves before 
the lime, pepper, and bread and butter, have reached liini. 
You can combat this contingency by breaking up the 
dishes containing these adjuncts into detachments, and 
serving them in two or three directions at once. But a 
far better plan is this. Before dinner is announced, put 
the plates of oysters with the slices of brown bread and 
butter upon them in each guest's place, and send your 
vinegar and pepper round as fast as you can after they 
are seated. 

In selecting your hors d\iiuvres to accompany the cheese 
try to avoid giving two fishy things on the same dish, 
thus : — do not give anchovies, and prawn butter together, 
or olives farcies and caviare ; but take, let us say, anchovy 
butter, devilled ham, and oat biscuit, or cream cheese, 
olives far(-ies, and wafer biscuit. Here are a few com- 
binations : — 

Anchovy fillets, watercress, butter, dry toast. 

Kippered seer fish, sliced tongue, oat biscuit. 

Herring d la sardine, potted tongue, dry biscuit. 

Cheese fingers, green butter, radishes. 

Cucumber, olives farcies, oat biscuit. 

Pilchards in oil, maitre d'hotel butter, pulled bread. 

The best cheese you can get, cut into dice, should accom- 
pany the above if served a VAnglaise at that period of the 
dinner. 



MORS D'CEUVRES. 215 



The garnishing of the compartments of the liors fVoeuvres 
dish should be tastefully done with knots of curled parsley, 
curled cress, a little bunches of fresh water-cress. 

A single cold canape, if very carefully composed, may be 
placed upon each guest's plate as a prelude to the dinner 
when oysters are out of season. Cut some thin slices of 
stale brown or white bread, butter them as for sandwiches, 
and cut out of them a number of oblong pieces two inches 
long, and one and a half broad. Make sandwiches as 
follows : — Upon one of the pieces put a fillet of anchovy 
cut into strips, with a thin slice of olive here and there to 
fill interstices ; smooth the combination over with some 
pounded hard-boiled yolk of egg, dust over with yellow 
pepper, and cover with one of the pieces of bread. Gar- 
nish each sandwich thus made with a turned olive, or a 
sprig of water-cress. Or sprinkle over each a canopy of 
grated ham, granulated hard-boiled yolk of eg^, or cod's 
roe. 

In like manner you can with a little forethought com- 
pose divers canapes, using caviare, sardines, fish-roe, green 
Vjutter, strips of green capsicum, or of cucumber, and 
garnishing with tongue cut tastefully with a cutter, grated 
ham, or powdered hard-boiled yolk of egg. 

In making canapes, for service before dinner, care should 
be taken to keep them small. The dimensions I have 
ijiven should not be exceeded and the bread should be 
cut thin. 

Home-made cream cheeses are not seen as often as they 
ought to be, and yet a child could make one, following any 
domestic cookery book recipe. There are few things more 
appreciated at the end of a dinner party than this most dain- 
ty little dish. A breakfast-cupful of pure cream will yield a 
pretty little cheese for a party of six. The method is 
simple enough. Mix a tea-spoonful of salt with a large 



216 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

breakfast-cupful of rich cream, stir it well, and then pour 
the cream into a slop basin in which a clean piece of soft 
linen has been laid. When the cream has been thus turned 
into the cloth, draw the ends of the cloth together, holding 
the cream as it were in a bag, tie it tightly with string, 
and hang the bag in a cool place to drip ; when the drip- 
ping of moisture from the bag ceases, the cheese is ready : 
take the bag down, turn the contents out into a clean cloth, 
mould it into a circular form, or shape it in a neat square, 
and serve it on a dish garnished with green leaves. Let 
it stand in the ice-box till wanted. A day will be found 
sufiBcient for the making of this kind of cheese in warm 
weather and about forty-eight hours on the Hills. Use a 
porous sort of cloth for the operation, so as to encourage 
the escape of the whey from the cheese. It is sometimes 
advisable to change the cloth during the draining process. 

Fancy butters have of late become justly popular. 
There are many ways of making them. The objects you 
must keep in view when composing a fancy butter, may be 
thus summed up : — a pleasant flavour, a pretty tint, and 
novelty. To secure the first it is imperatively necessary 
that the basis upon which you work be beyond suspicion. 
The butter you use must be the best possible. If, there- 
fore, you cannot make it at home from cream you have set 
under your own eye, I strongly advise you to use that of a 
freshly opened " Denmark'' tin. You must wash the butter 
well with milk, and form it with your butter-bat, setting 
it in ice afterwards. The colouring is clap-trap work : 
you can get a nice green tint from '* spinach greening," 
and a pretty orange scarlet from crab, or tinned lobster 
coral. Novelty rests with yourself : you can ring the 
changes upon pounded anchovies, sardines, soft herring 
roes, lobster, prawns, crab, and pilchards : you can use 
capers, parsley, water-cress, garden-cress, gherkins, and 
olives. By the judicious selection of your ingredients, all 



MORS D'CEUVRES. 217 

of which are agreeable in fancy butter, you will avoid 
sameness, and secure success. This is my recipe for a 
stock " green-butter" : — 

1. — Weigh a quarter of a pound of butter such as I have 
described, and ice it. 

2. — Boil a couple of good handfuls of spinach, drain 
them thoroughly, pass the leaves through the hair sieve, 
and save all the jDulp, so obtained, in a bowl. 

3. — Take six full sized anchovies from the tin, wipe 
them free from oil, pick out their back bones, pass them 
through the hair sieve, and save the pulp. 

4. — Mince as finely as possible sufficient curled parsley 
to fill a table-spoon generously. 

5. — Mince also as finely as possible capers sufficient to 
fill a tea-spoon, heaped up. 

6. — Having these ingredients ready, first colour the 
butter by working into it, as lightly as you can, enough 
'' spinach-greening" to secure the tint you require (it is 
always wise to order a little more spinach than you think 
you may want, to be on the safe side) then add the other 
things by degrees, and when thoroughly 'incorporated, 
trim the butter into a tasteful mould, or sundry pretty 
patlets, and set it in the ice-box. 

Maitre d' hot el butter I have already given (page 82.) 
It is quite worthy of a place amongst hors d'ceiivres. 

Prawn butter, — a highly delicious composition, should 
be made in this way : — Boil the prawns, clean them care- 
fully, pound them to a paste in your mortar, mixing a 
little butter with them to assist the operation. Now, melt 
some butter in a sauce-pan, mix your pounded prawn meat 
in it, and as soon as it appears to have absorbed the butter 
(having been well stirred during the process and flavoured 
with a very little cayenne pepper, and powdered mace) 

19 



218 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

take it out, let it get cold and mix it with yonr iced butter 
in the proportion of about half and half. The pounding 
must be thorough ; there should be no granulated particles 
of prawn meat in the butter. 

Crab-coral butter, and lobster butter may be made ex- 
actly as the foregoing : in the case of the former, I would 
put in a couple of anchovies, as the coral is rather taste- 
less ; and in that of the latter, I would wash the lobster 
clean, getting rid of all oily, tinny juices. To do this, 
turn the contents of tin out upon a sieve, with a bowl un- 
der it to catch the liquor ; when the lobster meat drips no 
longer, pour over it a good jugful of clean cold watei- 
turning the pieces so that they may all come under the 
stream, then dry and pound it. 

Hard-boiled yolks of eggs may be passed through the 
sieve, and be made to form a jiart of any fancy butter . 
they tint plain butter yellow, and make a tasty pat if fla- 
voured with soft herring roes, or cod's roes, peppered, and 
sharpened with a few capers. 

Fish that is very salt must, of course, be soaked in water 
before it can be used : anchovies in oil do not need that 
treatment. Dorgona anchovies, on the other hand, must 
be freed from brine by steeping. 

Home-made potted meats, if carefully made, so far sur- 
])ass those which you get in tins, that I can hardly under- 
stand why they are so rarely attempted. Really good 
butter, and a very little pure gravy, attentively extracted 
from some fresh meat and bones, are the chief corner- 
vStones in such compositions. Ramasamy invariably over- 
spices his potted meat, cooks it over the fire in some strange 
way, and the less we enquire into the class of butter he 
uses the better. 

Potted prawns should be made precisely as laid down 
for prawn butter, omitting the final amalgamation with 



MORS D'CEUVRES. 219 

batter. I will select home-made potted tongue as a trust- 
worthy method of using up meat advantageously : — 

Take one pound weight of tongue, home-cured, (do not 
hesitate to pay eight or ten annas for it when fresh : the 
sum w411 not ruin you, and you will get you money's 
worth) four ounces of the best butter, a salt-spoonful 
of pounded mace, a coffee-cup of beef gravy, a tea- spoonful 
of " spiced pepper" (q. v. page 111), and work them in 
this manner : — cut off the hard skin of the tongue, and 
pass the meat through your mincing machine : after that, 
pound it thoroughly in your mortar, adding the butter 
and gravy during the operation : press the meat through 
youi' wire-sieve to get rid of gristle, and lumps, work the 
spiced pepper and mace into it, and pat it down tightly in 
a jar : smooth the surface : melt a table- spoonful of the 
same sort of butter in a sauce-pan, and pour it over the 
surface ; let it get cold, and the work will be completed. 
This receipt is practicable, as to quantities, with cold corned 
beef, chicken and tongue (half and half), cold roast beef, 
and even mutton. Roast-beef, and mutton, require aboiit 
three anchovies to the pound, as they have not the flavour 
of salted meat. 

Potted snipe, hare, partridges, &c., are excellent. 
Don't forget the livers when you are potting birds, 
and turn back to page 70 for my recipe for "/oie gras 
forcemeat," a little of which will encourage your game 
'pate exceedingly. If you happen to have any spare atoms 
of truffles handy, slip them into the potted meat, and no 
man will blame you. 

" Mock-crab" is the name given to a very good hors 
(.Voiuvre in which cheese plays a prominent part; it is 
made in this way : — a quarter of a pound of prawn meat, 
two ounces of good fresh cheese, a tea-spoonful of mustard 
powder, a dessert-spoonful of salad oil, a dessert-spoonful 



220 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

of " ancho\y vinegar," and a liberal dusting of spiced 
pepper. Pound everything (omitting the prawns) and 
"^ork the mixture till it looks like a very thick mayonnaise 
sauce, adding oil if necessary to obtain that result : when 
ready, mingle it with the prawn meat, pounded, &c., as in 
the former receipt, and trim it into a shapely little mould 
for serving. Even without any prawn meat a very good 
mock-crab can be made : a table-spoonful of anchovy sauce 
supplies the fishy flavour. 

" Pulled bread" accompanies the cheese in the place of 
biscuits. You can make it easily enough, if you bake at 
home, as follows : — Make a pound loaf, and when the bread 
is all but done, take it from the oven, tear the crumb from 
the inside with a fork in irregular pieces, place them on a 
buttered baking tin and crisp them in the oven. 

Use coarse grained oatmeal for your oat biscuits, and 
send them up piping hot from the griddle. As a general 
rule the oat cake made in India is far too thin : the paste 
should be rolled at least a quarter of an inch thick before 
being cut into cakes. 

" Cheese fingers" should be made in these proportions, — 
a quarter of a pound of puff paste, a pinch of salt, two 
ounces of grated Parmesan, or other mild cheese, and a 
very little cayenne, Nepaul pepper, or a few drops of 
" tabasco." Work the ingi^edients together, roU the paste 
out about half an inch thick, cut it into oblong shapes, 
about three inches long, bake and serve as hot as possible, 
on a napkin. 

" Devilled ham" is sold in tins, it is as good a thing as 
can be got at a pinch, if you have no time to make a hors 
dUptivre at home. It is not as hot as its name would lead 
you to suppose : it is merely potted ham well peppered. 

Buy your "Bombay ducks" in tins from Treacher and 
Co., of that city. I discovered this in Piccadillij of all 



MORS D'CEUVRES. 



221 



places in the world. Jackson and Co. import the " ducks" 
from Bombay neatly flattened out, floured, and packed in 
oblong tins. When jou remember the number of hands 
through which the bazar-bought fish passes, the flies that 
have settled upon it, and the impossibility of washing 
dried fish, you will, I hope, agree with me that my recom- 
mendation is absolutely philanthropical.

Savoury Toasts. 

VJ^TO disli is more thoroughly useful, or more generally 
•!Jl\ |N popular, than the savoury toast. It is a kind of 
thing that can frequently be made at a pinch, 
Avhen the larder is all but empty, and a hungry friend 
drops in unexpectedly. A dainty feeder will sometimes 
fancy it when he will scarcely look at anything in the 
way of food. If well made, it serves as a finish to a 
little home dinner, and it is equally acceptable at breakfast, 
luncheon, or supper. In its composition tasty scraps of all 
kinds can be used up successfully, without any great effort 
on the part of the cook, or loss of time. In common with 
almost every branch of cookery, this offshoot of the science 
is susceptible of elaborate, as well as of simple treatment ; 
and may be fashioned to obey the dictates of extravagance 
as well as those of the strictest economy. Yet, generally 
speaking, savoury toasts of an ordinary kind ought to be 
favourably regarded by all thrifty house-keepers, inasmuch 
as they afford an easy and pleasant way of working up 
fragments of good food that might otherwise be wasted. 

The rules of toast-making are few, and very simple : — 
1. — Unless sj^ecially stated to the contrary in the recipe, 
the slice of bread destined to receive any savoury compo- 
sition should be delicately /rzeti in butter till of a golden 
colour, rather than toasted in the ordinary manner. If 



SAVOURY TOASTS. 223 

kept waiting at all, ordinarily toasted bread becomes 
spongy or sodden, and soon loses its crisj^ness. The easy 
process of toasting too, is frequently slurred over carelessly, 
and the bread is scorched, not toasted. If you watch a 
native servant in the act of toasting, you will generally find 
that he places the slice of bread as close to the glowing 
embers as possible. Setting aside the risk that the bread 
thus incurs of catching a taint of gas from the live char- 
coal, it cannot be evenly and delicEitely browned, neither can 
it attain that thorough crispness which is a sine quel non in 
properly made toast. The slice of bread must be kept some 
little distance from the clear embers, being gradually 
heated through, crisped, and lightly and evenly browned 
by degrees. But, as I said before, bread fried in good butter 
is better, with a very few exceptions, than toasted bread 
for the sort of dishes we are going to discuss. 

2. — A Savoury toast is not worth serving unless it be 
piping hot : it may be kept hot in the oven, to be sure, 
but it is never so good as when set before the hungry guest 
the moment it has been completed. In order to ensure this 
' slickness' (to borrow a trans-Atlantic term) let the cook 
be warned to have everything ready, but not actually to 
finish off the making of his toast till it is wanted. It is 
better to keep the table waiting for three or four minutes 
for a bonne-bouche, than to serve immediately such a miser- 
able fiasco as a cold toast. 

The next thing to consider is the composition of a savoury 
toast, which I will endeavour to describe in a series 
of recipes. Let us commence with our time-honoured 
friend : — 

Anchovy toast. If you have a tin of anchovies in oil, 
the process is this : — Take six anchovies, wipe them free 
from oil, split them open, remove the spines, and pass the 
fish through your hair sieve : put the pulp in a bowl, and 
stir into it the yolks of two raw eggs. Cut four nice 



224 CULINARY yOTTIXGS FOR MADRAS. 

rounds or slices of bread, and fry them in butter till of a 
bright golden tint ; arrange them on a very hot silver dish, 
and cover them up. Now, melt a table-spoonful of butter 
at the bottom of a sauce-pan which should be dipped 
into a hain-marie or any vessel containing boiling water ; 
stir into the melted butter the anchovy pulp mixture, let 
it thicken and when quite hot, pom* it over the four toasts, 
and send the dish up immediately. 

Or, — (to be made at the table, with anchovy sauce) 
choose a very hot plate indeed, put a lump of butter upon 
it, and let the butter melt ; add the yolks only of two raw 
eggs well beaten, and stir into the mixture sufficient 
anchovy sauce to colour it a pale salmon pink — (if you put 
in enough to obtain a darker shade, it will be too salt) — 
add a dessert-spoonful of sherry and mix it well. Whilst 
doing this, a servant should, in this instance, be toastinq 
slices of bread in the verandah hard by, and each slice 
should be brought in hot from the fire, turned over on both 
sides in the mixture, and passed round at once, one after 
another. A toast that has been well soalced in a sauce like 
this, and crisped in the oven afterwards, is far from 
bad. 

Anchovy toasts arc sometimes sent up with tasty top- 
dressings, such as poached (^gs:^, buttered eggs, and this 
sauce : — Beat up the yolks of four eggs, and pour them 
by degrees into a small sauce-pan in which two ounces 
of butter have been melted over a very moderate fire, or 
in the bain-marie : add two table-spoonfuls of cream and a 
tea-spoonful of vinegar, continue to stir the sauce gently 
till it thickens nicely, and pour it over your anchovy toasts. 
This sauce should be carefully watched, for if permitted 
to approach boiling, it will curdle and become lumpy ; 
what you want is a very thick, creamy-looking custard. 

Purees of certain vegetables are very nice as top-dress- 



SAVOURY TOASTS. 225 

ings for anchovy toasts ; especially those of spinach, beet- 
root leaves, peas, or any delicate greens. 

A number of nicB toasts can be made with eo-o-s ; from 
the plainly poached egg served upon a little square of 
bread fried a golden brown in butter, to the delicate 
^^ r Sties des oeufs hrouilles aux trufes.'^ 

Buttered eggs (ceufs hrouilles) are undeniably good if 
served quite simply, upon crisply fried bread, straight 
from the fire. Grated ham, finely minced tongue, and 
little dice of crisply fried bacon, are capital, if at hand, 
to garnish the surface of the eggs with ; and chopped 
herbs, anchovy, or the minced remnants of any fish like 
sardines, pilchards, or herrings, may be stirred into the 
eggs just before serving with marked advantage. Cold 
cooked vegetables, such as cauliflower, artichokes, aspara- 
gus, &c., may be cut up and mixed with the eggs in the 
same way, — in fact, a moment's thought will generally 
enable a careful cook to make his buttered egg toasts ad- 
ditionally tasty by the introduction of some nice trifle left 
from a previous meal, which could scarcely be made use 
of in any other manner. 

Hard-boiled eggs make a very eatable toast in this 
way : — Grate a coifee-cupful of corned beef, bacon-lean, or 
ham ; cut four hard-boiled eggs into eight pieces each ; 
mix a good sauce hlanche rather thickly, flavour it with a 
tea-spoonful of anchovy sauce, and slip into it, so as to get 
thoroughly hot, the cut up eggs ; when steaming, pour the 
contents of your sauce-pan over four nicely fried squares 
of bread, dust the grated beef over their surfaces and 
serve at once. 

The happy o^\mers of dairies to whom cream is not an 
extraordinary luxury should try : — 

" Boties des oeufs a la creme," which are simply poached 



226 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

eggs served upon crisply fried toasts, with thick boiling 
cream poured over them. 

Woodcock toast is one of the most recherche of all 
savoury entremets of this class. Numerous recipes are 
given for it, and its name is distorted by many writers upon 
cookery, some of whom ])resent it to their readers under 
the meaningless title of " Scotch-Woodcock." In its un- 
pretending form this toast is exceedingly like one I have 
already given, viz. : — a better kind of anchovy toast with 
an egg-cream custard to})-dressing, but I'eal " AYoodcock- 
toast" should be composed as follows : — 

Take two freshly boiled fowl's livers, — [those of a goose, 
a turkey, or a couple of ducks, are better still, while the 
remains of iipdte de foie gras are superlatively the best] — 
j)()und the liver to a paste, mixing with it a tea-spoonful 
of anchovy sauce, or the flesh of one fish pounded, a pinch 
of sugar, plenty of fresh butter, and the yolk of one raw 
egg ; dnst into it a little spiced pepper, pass it througli the 
sieve, and set it aside on a clean plate. Prepare four 
squares of golden-tinted, crisply-fried, bread, about lialf an 
inch thick, spread the liver paste over them and set them in 
a moderate oven to retain their heat, but not to burn. Xow, 
pour a coffee-cupful of good cream into a sauce-pan, which 
must either be dipped into a buin-marie, or placed over a 
very low fire indeed ; stir into it, as it warms, the carefully 
strained yolks of two raw eggs, continue stirring one way 
till the cream thickens nicely and is quite hot (without 
boiling) and pour it over your toasts : the egg whites 
(whisked by an assistant to a stiff froth whilst you wei-e 
heating and thickening the cream) should be laid on the 
top of all, and the dish sent up without delay. 

Or the preparation may be slightly varied as folloAvs : — 
Fry the toasts, butter them, and set them in a mode- 
rate oven to keep hot. When heating the cream, stir into 



SAVOURV TOASTS. 227 

it the lli-er-paste as well as the raw yolks of two eggs, and 
pour it over the toasts as soon as it is quite hot, and 
thickened sufficiently, capping your dish with the whisked 
whites. 

KiDXEY TOAST is generally far from being considered a 
very dainty one. Let me suggest two methods, one with 
the kidneys au naturel, the other made with those which 
you can cut out of a cold roast saddle : — 

(a) — Take four ordinary kidneys, and blanch them first 
of all in scalding water (as recommended in Menu N'o. 23) 
then lift them out, and dry them in a cloth. Make a 
strong broth or gravy out of any bones or scraps you 
may have, and stew the kidneys therein till they are nice 
and tender, then take them out, drain them, and pour the 
gravy in which they were cooked into a bowl. Now, cut 
up and pound the kidneys to a paste in your mortar with 
some butter, and pass it through your sieve. When ready, 
skim any grease that may have risen to the top of your 
gravy, and take a medium-sized sauce-pan, working as 
follows : — Melt a dessert-spoonful of butter at the bottom 
of the sauce-pan, stir into it a dessert-spoonful of flour, 
when creamy, add by degrees a breakfast-cupful of the 
gravy and lastly, kidney-paste until all is expended : 
flavour the puree, with one table-spoonful port wine, one 
tea-spoonful red currant jelly, one dessert-spoonful anchovy 
vinegar, and a few drops of chilli vinegar. Let the contents 
of your sauce-pan thicken properly by coming to the boil, 
and then pour the puree over four squares of hot fried 
toast. Let there be no delay in serving. If made exactly 
in this way, this toast will be found an excellent one. 

(h) — Cut the kidneys out of the cold saddle, together 
with all the fat belonging to them ; chop up as much fat 
as there is of kidney meat for the toast, and throw the 
fat, freed from all burnt skin, &c., into your 



228 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

fiyiug-pan : now, fry in the melted fat a large round of 
bread till it turns a golden yellow, and has sucked up a 
good deal of the fat. Take it out, place it on a flat silver 
dish, cover its surface with the chopped pieces of kidney 
and the fat that you saved, pour the remaining melted fat 
over it, divide it into portions, and put it in the oven. 
When quite crisp, and * short,' serve straightway without 
fear. Mustard, Nepaul pepper, and salt, should accom- 
pany, and hot plates should be placed before each 
guest. 

Savoury toast made of the remains of cold roast game 
are delicious. Teal, wild-duck, snipe, quails, andflorican ; 
young pea-fowl, spur-fowl, jungle-fowl, and even par- 
tridges, may be thus presented a second time, forming a 
kind of rechauffe which rarely fails to be ajDpreciated. The 
method of preparing a g.ame-toast is somewhat similar to 
that I have described for "kidney toast" (a). The cold 
meat should be picked from the bones, and pounded with 
a little butter to a paste : the skin and bones (well mashed) 
should be set to make a good, strong, game-flavoured 
gravy wherewith to form a thick puree in conjunction 
with the pounded meat, the process of blending which 
is precisely the same as that mentioned in the recipe pre- 
viously alluded to. Pour the puree over hot fried toasts, 
and serve without hesitation. 

All purees of game composed for toasts should be mixed 
rather thickly so as to rest upon the toast, and not spread 
all over the dish. Nepaul pepper, and quarters of limes, 
should be handed round with them. 

I have already said that spinach, and other delicate 
greens — worked up in the form of purees — were very nice 
if served upon anchovy toast. They make capital toasts 
alone. A well made puree of spinach laid upon a crisply 
fried, and well buttered toast, is decidedly good ; a poach- 



SAVOURY TOASTS. 229 

ed egg, or a layer of " buttered eggs," can be added, of 
course, with additional effect. 

An excellent toast can be made with the tender leaves 
and stalks of the beetroot. After having been boiled and 
drained like spinach, they should be chopped up and 
heated in a sauce-pan with some butter, salt and pepper, 
and spread upon hot fried toast with as little delay as 
possible. Country greens, the leaves of the mollay-heeray 
especially, and (with slight modification according to their 
peculiarities) nearly all vegetables can be dressed in this 
manner. 

Vegetable marrows and cucumbers should be trimmed 
in neat fillets, their seeds should be cut out, and the pieces 
thus prepared should be boiled in hot salted water. These 
may be warmed again in a good sauce hlanclie or a nice 
thick brown sauce, laid upon toasts, and sent up. Or they 
may be heated up in boiling cream, and similarly served. 
The points of asparagus, cauliflower flowers, artichoke 
bottoms, and similar dainty vegetables, form admirable 
materials for toasts : they deserve delicate treatment, and 
can well bear association with thickened cream, veloute au 
Farmesan, or creme d'ancliois. 

Bande-cai (hliindi) TOAST is so well known that I need 
scarcely do more than mention it, out of respect as it were, 
for, homely as it is, there are few toasts more palatable. 
Cream, when it can be spared is, of course, a vast improve- 
ment, and the following variation will be found nice for a 
change : — Boil the bande-cais, and, when cold, scrape out 
the seeds and pulp from each pod into a small basin, using 
a silver spoon for the operation. Give the pulp a dusting 
of white pepper, and salt to taste, with a few drops of 
anchovy sauce. Fry rounds, or slices of bread, according 
to the number you want, in butter, and set them to keep 
crisp, and hot in the oven. Now, take a small sauce-pan, 

20 



230 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

place it in the hain-marie, or over a very moderate firC; 
melt a dessert-spoonful of butter in it, stir into it the bande- 
cai pulp, and two good table-spoonfuls of cream with the 
yolk of one egg. Continue stiii'ing one way until the 
contents of your sauce-pan look nice and thick, and steam- 
ing hot ; then pour the mixtui-e over the toasts, and serve. 
A dust of grated Parmesan cheese should be shaken over 
the surface of the toasts as an embellishment, and Nepaul 
pepper should be handed round. 

Very young Bkixjals (hinegun) may be treated exactly 
in the same manner as the foregoing, as also the pods of 
the moringa (" drum-stick") tree. Be sure that you select 
tender pods for toast-making, or the result will disappoint 
you. 

A very superior dish of this kind can be concocted if 
you happen to be able to obtain the flower-pod of a cocoa- 
nut palm. Treat the buds of the embryo flower which the 
pod contains as laid down for hande-cai ; that is to say, 
hoil the flower, after you have cut it out of the pod, in salt 
and water till tender, then cut off the buds, and heat them 
up in a sauce-pan in thickened cream, or in milk thickened 
with the yolks of two eggs, pour them over hot fried toasts, 
which should be sent up immediately. 

The white stalls of the flower, if quite young, can be 
served exactly like asparagus, i. e. : — boiled, laid in a very 
hot dish, with plenty of butter melting over them, or 
maitre cVhotel butter if at hand, and assisted by " Dutch 
sauce." No toast is needed in this case. The cocoanut 
flower-pods can be obtained now and then at Madras, for 
the toddy-drawers cut them off when tapping the palms 
for sap. I can strongly recommend my readers to try both 
the dishes I have mentioned. 

Sardine toast, hereixg toast, cod's-roe toast, pil- 
chard TOAST, SALMON TOAST, &c., <fec., are all nice, and 



SAVOURY TOASTS. 231 



very easily made. Trim the fish free from oil, skin, fins, 
bones, &c., and chop it up on a plate, give it a dust of 
Nepaul pepper, with a very little salt, and knead it up 
with a little butter. Put a pat of butter at the bottom of 
a sauce-pan, proceed as if to make a sauce blanche with a 
little milk, incorporate therewith the minced fish, add the 
yolk of an egg, and when thick enough and thoroughly 
hot, pour it upon slices of fried toast hot from the pan, 
and dish up quickly. The cold remains of all fish may be 
thus satisfactorily disposed of. " Buttered eggs" go won- 
derfully well with fish toasts, either laid as a top-dressing 
over the fish mince, or mingled with it ; and hard-boiled 
eggs may be cut up, and tossed with the fish in the sauce- 
pan just before serving. 

Cheese is another valuable ingredient in the hands of 
the toast-maker. Welsh rarebit, or " Ramakin toast" 
as it is called by Ramasamy, is universally familiar to 
native cooks, and is a dish upon which they generally 
fall back in an emergency, or when " Missis din't give 
arders" for any anything else. For a really good Welsh 
RAREBIT, you should have a sound fresh cheese, not over- 
strong, and proceed thus : — Grate two ounces of the cheese ^ 
mix with it an ounce of butter, a dessert-spoonful of made- 
mustard, a little salt, a pinch of Nepaul pepper, and the 
yolks of two eggs. Mix well together in a basin, and work 
the mixture thoroughly smooth. Toast a couple of neat 
slices of bread very carefully, butter them on both sides, 
place them on a dish that will stand the oven, spread the 
cheese mixture over them pretty thickly, and bake for ten 
minutes. If you want a smooth yellow surface, neither 
too brown nor dry, place your toasts in a buttered pie-dish^ 
and spread a sheet of common white paper over them : 
after ten minutes baking in a really hot oven, they will be 
ready, so remove the paper and serve forthwith. 

A good plain Cheese toast, made as followR; is not tc 



232 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 



be despised : — Cut a few very tliin slices of a nice fresh 
cheese, or grate two ounces of a hard dry one : put the 
cheese upon a small well buttered baking tin, and place it 
in the oven ; watch it carefully, and when it begins to 
dissolve, stir some butter into it, give it a dust of Nepaul 
pepper, and serve it upon crisply fried toasts quickly. 

To make a very toothsome cheese toast in the dining room 
I have found the following method successful. Take two 
table-spoonfuls of grated cheese, and mingle with it a des- 
sert-spoonful of mustard powder, a pinch of salt and dust 
of Nepaul pepper. Light a spirit lamp, and, in a little 
frying-pan placed over it, melt a dessert-spoonful of butter 
(tinned butter does capitally) ; when melted, shake evenly 
over the butter the powdered cheese, and stir Avell. As 
soon as the cheese looks creamy, stop, and pour it over 
some hot buttered toast brought in on the in=:tant from the 
verandah. 

Mock crab toast. — This variety of Welsh rarebit is 
generally popular. Pound two ounces of cheese with a 
dessert-spoonful of anchovy sauce, a dessert-spoonful of 
made-mustard, and one of vinegar, a pinch of Nepaul pep- 
per, and a little salt, the yolks of two eggs, and a table- 
spoonful of butter. Mix thoroughly in a basin, and pro- 
ceed as directed for Welsh rarehit. 

A toast that might correctly bear the name of " Rame- 
quin" is to be composed as follows : — Make the mixture 
exactly as laid down for " Ramequins en caisses,^^ Chapter 
24, and put it upon very carefully fried toasts, which should 
be arranged upon a silver dish, and baked for ten minutes, 
or until the cheese dressings on the toasts rise in the 
manner of fondues. If served at the nick of time, these 
little toasts will be found very good. 

Never use a rich ripe cheese, or one that is beginnincr 
to show the lovely tins of Jionorablc age, in cookery. A 



SAVOURY TOASTS. 233 

little mildew from damp in your bottle of grated Par- 
mesan, remember, will ruin any dish in which it may 
be used afterwards. Choose a good, fresh, hard, dry cheese, 
of a mild family, for toasts, &c. : between ourselves, indeed, 
I know of no more useful domestic sort than the round 
Butch. It is a cheap cheese, and inclined to be saltish in 
taste, but that is of no consequence in cookery ; all you 
have to do is to omit the item of salt mentioned in the 
recipe you may have selected. ' Dutch cheese' grates 
easily, and is rarely inclined to mouldiness. I^ext to Par- 
mesan, I would sooner use it than any of the other com- 
monly imported kinds. 

I may have omitted a few good toasts in this chapter, I 
hope, however, that I have given several that will prove 
acceptable.

Eggs, Maccaroni, and Cheese. 



Tt»yTNDER the title which I have selected for this chap- 
^vcJ^ ter, I propose to place before you a few dishes of 
a savoury nature, some of which will be found, I 
think, suitable for the breakfast, or luncheon table, and 
some of them worthy of a place as entremets in the choicest 
of dinner menus. 

Although many people must be aware that there arc 
numerous ways of cooking eggs nicely, why is it that so 
few attempt to go beyond the ordinary methods which 
have obtained in English kitchens since good King Ai'thur 
ruled the land ? It is the same with maccaroni : how rare 
a thing it is to see that most invaluable article of food 
dressed otherwise than in the time-honoured baking-dish. 
And, in the many uses of cheese, what ignorance we 
betray ! Whether taken independently, and made the 
most of alone, or combined together, and treated in some 
artistic fashion, we possess in these three things the ele- 
ments of certain dainty dishes which, in their way, are 
excellent. Singularly adapted to the climate in which 
we spend our exile, and inexpensive, they are at the same 
time invested with a certain amount of refinement that to 
many people is no slight recommendation. 

The accessories which are more or less necessary in this 
branch of cookery are : — good butter, cream occasionally, 



EGGS, MACCARONI, AND CHEESE. 235 

a little clear gravy, herbs and onion as used for omelette 
making, the tomato, cold vegetables, and carefully sifted 
bread-crumbs. The remains of fish, game, and poultry ; 
grated ham, corned beef, and tongue, and slices of saus- 
ages, may be also occasionally made use of by an ingenious 
cook. Let us first consider a few ways of serving eggs : — 

" (Eufs sur le plaf : — This simple, yet capital method of 
doing eggs in a hurry, should be noted. Melt a table- 
spoonful of butter in an omelette-]pSbiQ., and slip two eggs 
into it, carefully avoiding breaking the yolks ; let them set 
in the butter, as a poached egg sets in water ; the moment 
they are sufficiently firm, let them slide off into the hot 
dish ready to receive them, pouring the butter in which 
they were cooked over them. Put in the eggs the moment 
the butter melts ; for, when first they go in, the pan should 
not be too hot : a drop or two of tarragon vinegar may be 
shaken over the dished eggs, or a tiny bit of inaitre dlwtel 
butter the size of a pea may be allowed to melt over each 
of them. If after dishing the eggs, you return the pan to 
the fire, and brown the butter before pouring it over them, 
you have " oeufs au beurre noir.^' 

Eggs broken gently over very thin shavings of cheese, 
(which have been placed in melted butter in an omelette- 
pan over the fire) and allowed to set, are called " oeufsau 
frowiage'" : they should be dusted with pepper, and salt 
before serving. 

I have frequently mentioned " buttered-eggs"* in con- 
nection with fish, vegetable cookery, and toasts. By some, 
the dish is called " scrambled eggs," which is perhaps the 
more accurate title, being a translation of the French 
" cenfs hrouilles," the name given to it by our " lively 
neighbours." Do not forget the many ways in which you 
may serve this composition, and proceed to make it thus : — 

* The " rumlled eggs" of Ramasamj. 



23G CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

Break three eggs into a bowl with a salt-spoonful of salt, 
a table-spoonful of cream or of milk, and a dust of pepper : 
mix them well : melt a piece of butter the size of an egg 
in your 07?ieZef^e-pan : pour in your mixture, stir it about 
unceasingly until it is lightly set, and turn it out. Tomato 
pulp may be mixed with the eggs, and any nice meat such 
as ham, tongue, corned beef, game, &c., may be minced up, 
and added to them. The cream is by no means necessary^ 
neither is the milk, but with the poor eggs of the Indian 
fowl, I think the assistance they give is very perceptible. 

By adding grated cheese you have " ocufs hrouilles au 
frotnage :' "asparagus peas," and truffles arc also grand 
additions recommended by Gouffe. 

People who do not dislike the flavour of the onion will 
find their " buttered eggs" improved if a few thin slices 
of white onion be fried in tlic butter before the egg mixture 
is poured into it. 

Remember that reufs hrouilles arc served in France in 
the same way as an omelette, i.e., spread upon a hot dish 
alone or above a "puree of vegetable. Many people think 
that the composition should be associated with toast, and 
nothing else. 

" Q^ufs au jus": — Suppose that you have a nice break- 
fast-cupful of gravy saved from the joint which was served 
at last night's dinner. Choose a little pie-dish, and pour 
some of the gravy into it, so as to cover the bottom well ; 
flavour it with a little minced shallot, or any sweet herb, 
set it in the oven, and when it is hot, break into it as 
many eggs as will fill the dish nicely without crowding ; 
shake some bread-crumbs over the eggs, and some little 
pieces of minced anchovy, or the remains of any cold fish ; 
return the dish to the oven for three or four minutes, so 
that its contents may partly set ; then pour the rest of the 
gravy evenly over the surface, add another layer of fine 



EGGS, MACCARONI, AND CHEESE. 237 



crumbs, and bake for five or six minutes. Be careful not 
to let the eggs harden. 

" (Eufs a la Suisse'": — Choose a shallow pie-dish, and 
butter it liberally. Pour over the bottom of the dish a 
layer of cream a quarter of an inch deep, over that shake 
a coating of well grated cheese a quarter of an inch deep : 
if wide enough to hold them without crowding, slip in one 
by one as carefully as you can, — to avoid hreahing a single 
yolJc, — six eggs ; give them a dust of black pepper, and 
salt, and gently pour a little more cream over the surface, 
coating it over again with grated cheese. Let the dish 
remain in the oven until the eggs are set without being- 
hard, — the time will depend upon the state of the oven, — 
brown the surface by passing a red hot iron backwards 
and forwards over it, about an inch above the cheese, and 
serve. The cream should be really thick and rich, or the 
effect of the little entremets will be " poor indeed." This 
dish may be added to by first placing a layer of previously 
boiled maccaroni in the pie-dish, the cream being poured 
over it, then the cheese, and so on. 

" (Eufs au gratin : — Butter the bottom of a pie-dish 
previously well rubbed with shallot, and line it with some 
maccaroni already boiled in milk, pour round it half a pint 
of sauce blonde in which you have dissolved some grated 
Parmesan, or other mild well-rasped cheese, and upon that 
dispose a complete layer of hard-boiled eggs, sliced. A 
finely minced anchovy should be sprinkled over the eggs 
with pepper and salt or, better still, with a judicious dress- 
ing of "spiced salt" (q. v., page 111) for seasoning; and 
then a nice coating of bread-crumbs, and grated cheese 
mixed in equal proportions : drop a number of little bits of 
butter the size of a pea over the surface, and bake the 
dish till the top takes a golden brown tint. Slices of 
tomato, drained of their watery juice, and with their seeds 
picked out, may be laid upon the egg, or thin slices of

Bologna sausage ; and mushrooms, or truffle trimmings, 
may be chopped up, and sprinkled over them : there is 
ob\'iously ample scope for culinaiy ingenuity in the enrich- 
ment of " tvufs au grating 

" OEufs farcis" : — Boil six eggs for half an hour, take 
them out, and plunge them into cold water. When quite 
cold, peel ofF their shells, and, with a dessei-t-knife nibbed 
in butter, divide each egg in half, slicing a little piece of 
the rounded ends to admit of each half sitting upright 
upon a disli : now pick out the yolks, pound them with 
butter in a mortar, and proceed to dress them with any 
tasty trifles at your command, season the composition deli- 
cately, and fill the egg cases therewith, trimming the farce 
neatly, with a desseil-knife dipped in melted butter, in a 
convex-shape over each case, — for there will be more than 
enough mixtui*e to merely fill each cavity. For the farce, 
you can use finely minced olives, capers, anchovies, mush- 
rooms, and truffles ; veiy finely grated ham, the bruised 
liver of a chicken, the remains of a pate de foie gras, or a 
little sausage meat. A judicious selection of two or three 
of these ingredients, seasoned with " spiced pepper" is 
what you require, — say, one tea-spoonful of mixed farce to 
each half yolk. Having dressed your cases to your mind, 
fry a little square of bread for each one, as for canapes 
(q. V.) and place them thereon : arrange them on a flat 
silver dish slightly buttered, pour a little melted butter 
over each egg, and bake for five minutes. Some nicely 
fried bread-crumbs may be strewn over the dish when 
going to table. Eggs may, of course, be served in this 
manner very plainly farcis : a little minced curled parsley 
or marjoram, with a pounded anchovy, and some chopped 
olive, for instance, would not be a bad mixture when work- 
ed up with the hard yolks. 

(Eafs farcis are delicious when served cold, in which

form they should be sent up prettily garnished with curled 
parsley upon a flat China dish. 

Hard-boiled eggs may be fricasseed, or gently heated 
up, in a rich sauce like veloute, Espacfnole, or poulette ; and 
those who do not object to fried onions, might do worse 
than concoct a dish with their assistance in this way : — 

" (Eufs aux oignons'' : — Slice up a good sized Bombay 
onion, and fry the rings in a table-spoonful of butter till 
they are nice and yellow, add a little flour to the butter, 
and when it is mixed, pour in a breakfast-cupful of cream 
or fresh milk : give this a dasting with salt and " spiced 
pepper," and put into the sauce four hard-boiled eggs cut 
into slices ; simmer the sauce-pan till its contents are 
thoroughly hot, and serve garnished with curls of crisply 
fried bacon, alternated with neatly cut pieces of fried 
bread. 

If you stir a table-spoonful of good curry powder and a 
salt-spoonful of sugar into the melted butter and onions 
before adding the flour and cream, and cut the eggs 
in halves only, lengthwise, the dish will be " cenfs cv 
Vlndienne.'' 

Jsf.B. — Plainly poached eggs served on toast, with this 
curry sauce poured over them, are very nice, and more 
digestible than the hard boiled. 

Supposing that you desire to err on the side of studied 
simplicity, cut four hard-boiled eggs in halves, trim them 
like " ceufsfarcis" to stand upright, set them on a flat silver 
dish slightly buttered, and bake them until quite hot, then 
serve with a cap of maitre d'hotel butter, prawn butter (or 
any fancy butter left from last night's dinner) melting 
over each half egg. The error will be pardonable, 

" CEufs aux topinamhours" : — This delicious entremets 
should be prepared in this wise : — Choose four good sized 



240 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

Jerusalem artichokes, trim, boil, and set them to cool ; 
take four hard-boiled eggs, and cut them in halves ; out 
of the artichokes prepare eight flat slices, and place half an 
egg upon each slice with the rounded end uppermost : set 
them on a buttered dish, heat them thoroughly in the oven, 
and just before serving, pour over them some thickly 
worked " veloiite an Parmesan,'' or some melted maitre 
(Thotel butter. A dusting of " spiced salt" should be given 
on taking the eggs from the oven. 

This entremets is nicer still with artichoke bottoms, — the 
leafy kind, and with ceufs farcis instead of plain hard- 
boiled eggs. 



Maccaroxi, and the numerous varieties of the Italian 
])aste family of which it is the best known member, should 
invariably be plunged into boiling water to commence 
w ith — no matter whether you intend to cook them in milk, 
or stock, afterwards — in order to rid them of the imper- 
ceptible dirt which clings to them. Remember that mac- 
caroni is a much handled comestible, and that washing it 
in w^ater is not enough. I adverted to this when speaking 
of soups (page 34), and described how the cleansing can 
alone be effected. Besides, maccaroni must not be wetted 
to begin with by any liquid not boiling. 

Mark these golden rules : — " Washing maccaroni is use- 
less and unnecessary, putting it to cook in cold water is a 
blunder, soaking it is a crime." Treat it as our native 
cooks do rice, — here let me yield to Raraasamy, or his 
tunnycutch (?) the praise that either he, or she, deserves, 
— and throw it into plenty of boiling water, test it occasion- 
ally with a fork, as soon as it is nice and tender, stop the 
boiling by a dash of cold water, lift the vessel, and drain 
it completely, retm-ning the maccaroni to the hot pan. 

If yon want to cook Italian pastes in milk or stock. 



EGGS, MACCARONl, AND CHEESE.^' -41 

whichever you use should be boiling : parboil the paste in 
boiling water for five minutes to clean it, drain it carefully, 
and turn it into the stock or milk also boiling as the case 
may be to finish cooking. 

The accepted form of serving maccaroni with English- 
men is either swimming in white sauce round a boiled 
fowl, or turkey, or in a pie-dish "azi grating In the 
former fashion it is generally presented in such a flabby, 
tasteless manner, that the general unpopularity of Italian 
pastes may be easily accounted for. The " au gratin''' is 
better understood perhaps, but even there, there is room 
for improvement. 

" Maccaroni au gratin ;" — First boil the maccaroni as I 
have laid down, if in milk or stock, so much the better. 
Well butter a pie-dish, arrange the maccaroni therein 
neatly, give it a dusting with black pepper and salt, pour 
round it a large cupful of good sauce blonde (q. v., page 82) 
in which you have mixed two ounces of grated cheese : let 
this run well in amongst the bed of maccaroni, and shake 
over the surface a liberal coating of grated cheese. Make 
this thoroughly hot, in the oven, brown the surface of 
the cheese by passing a hot iron about half an inch above 
it, and send it up. 

Maccaroni " au gratin' should be nice and moist : you 
can use cream instead of sauce blonde if you like, and 
tomato puree may be introduced in its composition. A 
little minced fish such as herring, prawns, lobster, or 
anchovy, may be dotted about amongst the maccaroni, and 
with minced ham and chicken, or tongue and chicken, you 
can make a capital home-dinner entree, following in other 
resjDCcts the ordinary recipe. 

"Maccaroni fW J^aZieiwe" will be found in Chapter 
XIX, (page 189). 

''Maccaroni o; la 3IUanaisc," another excellent method. 



242 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

may be described as follows : — Boil two ounces of macca- 
roni, and keep it hot in its ovm pan after draining. Make 
a breakfast-cupful of good chicken broth flavoured with an 
onion, sweet herbs, and black pepper corns. With that 
make a nice " velonfe au fromage" in this way ; — Melt an 
ounce of butter in a sauce-pan, stir into it a dessert-spoon- 
ful of flour, mix them to a paste, and by degrees pour in 
the hot chicken broth ; as this is thickening, add to it two 
ounces of grated cheese, or Parmesan from the bottle, a 
tea-spoonful of powdered mustard, salt, and " spiced pep- 
per," at discretion ; continue to stir the sauce until it 
reaches a creamy thickness, when you can finish it off the 
fire by a table-spoonful of cream, or the yolks of two raw 
eggs beaten separately. Now, stir the sauce into the hot 
boiled maccaroni, and serve immediately. 

The association of tomatoes with maccaroni seems to be 
as happy as that of green peas with a duckling, egg sauce 
with saltfish, or red currant jelly with a well hung saddle. 
These vegetables are generally applied in the form of 
puree, to achieve which you must cut them into quarters, 
trim them from stalk, &c., and put them into a sauce-pan 
with an ounce of butter, and one onion sliced in rings, a 
few pepper corns, three cloves of garlic, a tea-spoonful of 
dried basil, and a little salt ; boil till the quarters are quite 
soft, and then turn the contents of the sauce-pan out upon 
a hair sieve. Let the watery part escape, you do not want 
it, and when thus drained, pick out the garlic, and pepper 
corns, and rub the vegetable through the sieve with a 
wooden spoon : the pulp that comes through, — well pep- 
pered with black pepper, — must be heated again with a 
lump of butter and a little flour before it is mixed with 
the maccaroni. 

Maccaroni with ^^ conserva di pomi d'oro" is an Italian 
delicacy. The conserva is, as may readily be supposed, a 
regular jam made by reducing a good quantity of the puree 



EGGS, MACCARONI, AND CHEESE. 243 

aforesaid in a sauce-pan over the fire, stirring it without 
ceasing until it attains the consistency of thin paste. This 
well seasoned with salt and pepper may be preserved in 
bottles, and if securely corked, and waxed, will keep well. 
During their season, tomatoes absolutely rot in the ground 
in many a private garden in this Presidency : why permit 
such waste ? the trouble of making a few bottles of this 
conserve would be amply repaid in the hot weather when 
the plants have died down. A spoonful or two of the 
preserve, thinned with a very little stock, and with a pat 
of butter worked into it, would, at all times, be handy for 
dressing maccaroni. A dusting of finely grated cheese 
should, of course, accompany it. 

Here is a ' foreign composition' w^hich I commend to 
the attention of those who like Italian cookery : — Mince 
a couple of cloves of garlic, a shallot, three anchovies, 
boned and well wiped from the tin oil, and four olives, 
put the mince into a small sauce-pan with three table- 
spoonfuls of the best salad oil, boil till the bits of garlic 
and onion begin to brown, and then turn the mixture into 
a sauce-pan containing a large dish of hot-boiled macca- 
roni, stir it well, and serve. An Italian cook would 
probably put in half a dozen, or more, cloves of garlic : in 
the proportions I have given, however, I do not think the 
taste of the bulb will be considered more 2^'^ononce than it 
is in chutneys, and numerous dishes made in India which 
we eat without murmuring. 

Several dishes will be found in my viejius in which mac- 
caroni figures, for I have the highest opinion of its merits 
in savoury cookery. The rules I have given will, I think, 
be found reliable with respect to all kinds of Italian paste, 
Lasagne, Cannelli, MostaccmoU, Sfc.j and I sincerely hope 
that what I have said may be the means of drawing my 
readers' attention to a comestible which deserves far 
greater consideration than Englishmen, as a rule, bestow 



244 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 



ni^on it. An inexpensive article of food which, with a 
little study, may be made a luxury, is surely a thing that 
the banished lover of good things can ill afford to despise. 



I think I am right in saying that there are very few 
establishments in India in which a day passes without the 
preparation of kick for the table. It is, as a rule, served 
plainly boiled, and in that form can rarely be found fault 
with. Friend Ramastimy commits, as I have endeavoured 
on several occasions to point out, mistakes of divers kinds, 
and of various degrees in the scale of culinary atrocities, 
but failure in the cooking of rice is certainly not one of 
them. Having at our command, then, a species of farina- 
ceous food, cheap, nutritive, of excellent quality, and 
which our cooks can dress to perfection, do we take full 
advantage of the many opportunities we possess of develop- 
ing its resources ? I am inclined to think that we do not. 
I have therefore introduced the subject in close connection 
with maccaroni advisedly, for it will be seen that in the 
better treatment of rice, the laws that govern the cookery 
of Italian pastes are often similar. 

The boiling of rice is, as I have said, a matter of no 
difficulty to us in India. The native cook thoroughly 
understands the process, and invariably, I m.ay say, sends 
an inviting looking dish to the table in which each grain 
appears to have been cooked independently, snowy white 
in appearance, and free from impurities of all kinds. A 
sodden mass of " stodgy" rice as dressed by Mary Jane in 
England is a thing unknown to the Anglo-Indian Exile. 
There are, however, some who may like to know how 
the task is performed, so for their benefit here is the 
recipe : — 

Having thoroughly sifted, and cleansed the rice, cast it 
into boiling water with a pinch of sugar, a salt-spoonful 



EGGS, MACCARONI, AND CHEESE. 245 

of salt, and the juice of a quarter of a lime. Stir the 
grains as they are cooking with a wooden spoon every now 
and then, and in about twelve minutes test them by taking 
of few grains out of the water, and pinching them between 
the finger and thumb. As soon as the grain is tender, 
check the boiling by a dash of cold water, remove the 
vessel from the fire, and invert it, holding the rice securely 
with the lid yet leaving space enough for the escape of 
the water. When quite dry, re-invert the pan, shaking 
the well drained grains of rice in the hot vessel in which 
they were cooked. Lastly, cover the pan with a clean 
cloth, and let it rest on the hot-plate, or over a very low 
fire to complete the drying. After this, the rice will be 
ready and may either be sent up as it is, or dressed accord- 
ing to one of the following recipes : — 

Wiz a la Napolitaine : — Empty the well boiled rice into 
a hot sauce-pan with plenty of butter : stir till thoroughly 
hot and well lubricated, add tomato pulp enough to moisten 
the whole nicely, and finish with finely grated Parmesan, 
Gruyere, or other mild dry cheese. Serve piping hot. 
When lifted with the fork, the grains of rice should carry 
with them long strings or tendrils of melted cheese as in 
the case of Maccaroni a V Italienne. 

Biz a V Italienne : — Melt an ounce of butter at the bot- 
tom of a sauce-pan which ought to have been previously 
well rubbed with a piece of garlic ; shred an onion the 
size of a racquet ball very finely and fry it in the butter ; 
stir into this, when of a golden yellow colour, two breakf ast- 
cupf uls of well boiled rice ; work it vigorously with a 
wooden spoon while an assistant shakes into the pan a 
couple of heaped up table-spoonfuls of grated Parmesan 
or Gruyere ; garnish the dish with strips of anchovies, and 
serve it piled upon a flat dish. 

Riz a la honne femme : — As the foregoing, but stirring 

09 



246 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

into the mixture some finely rasped ham, or corned beef, 
and garnishing with cnrls of crisply fried bacon. 

J^iz a V Indienne : — Commence as laid down for riz a 
V Italienne using plenty of good butter. Omit the tomato 
pulp, and instead of the grated cheese, stir in a table-spoon- 
ful of well made cuny powder, and garnish with prawns 
that have been tossed in butter with a pinch of saffron. 

Riz au chou : — Boil some rice as for the above, and keep 
it ready in a dish. Cut up the heart of a tender cabbage 
(a ' savoy,' or 'sugar-loaf,' for instance). Melt a couple 
of ounces of butter in a I'oomy stew-pan, cast into it a 
finely slircd Bombay onion, and two cloves of garlic minced 
as small as possible : let the onion turn yellow, and then 
put in the shred cabbage, stir it about for three minutes 
with the butter and onions, and then pour over it enough 
broth or consomme to keep it from burning : stew gently 
now until the cabbage is cooked, then add the rice which 
should be vigorously stinted about for five minutes with 
the cabbage. The dish is now ready. Turn it out upon 
a flat dish, and smother it with grated cheese. A slice of 
nice bacon may, with advantage, be cooked with the cab- 
bage ; it should be cut into dice, and put in with the 
butter[and onion. For an ordinary head of cabbage, three 
breakfast-cupfuls of rice will be found enough. 

Riz a la Turque : — In this, and in the following cases, 
the rice is not icliolly boiled beforehand. Put into a sauce- 
pan six coffee-cupfuls of broth or consomme into which 
sufficient tomato pulp has been stirred to slightly thicken 
it, flavour this with salt and black pepper to taste, and set 
the sauce-pan on the fire. As soon as the liquid boils, 
cast into it three coffee-cupfuls of well cleansed raw rice. 
Reduce the heat, and let the rice stew gently in the 
tomato-flavoured gravy. As the rice cooks it will absorb 
the liquid : watch it narrowly, and as soon as it has sucked 



EGGS, MACCARONI, AND CHEESE. 247 

up the whole of it, stir into it an ounce of fresh butter. 
Just before serving, a dust of nutmeg should be added, 
and some raisins carefully picked and cleaned may be 
thrown in as a garnish. 

Another method BjIZ ol la Milanaise, is to parboil the 
rice for five minutes, and then to fry it in butter with a 
shred onion until it begins to take colour. After that to 
add stock without tomato, but coloured with saffron. 
When the rice is cooked, the gravy may be thickened 
with flour, and the whole served hot with grated Parmesan. 
Some, in this case, add the stock by degrees, allowing the 
rice to drink it up as it were. As this process is conduct- 
ed, the grains gradually distend, and when ready to 
burst are fit to serve. No thickened gravy is served with 
this, — the true risotto of Italy, — but a pat of butter is 
melted among the grains, while Parmesan is liberally 
dusted over them. 

JRiz a la menagere : — For this excellent plat., wash and 
blanch six ounces of rice in boiling water for five minutes^ 
using a roomy stew-pan; cool and drain it on a sieve. 
Weigh a quarter of a pound of the best streaky bacon, dip 
it into scalding water for a couple of minutes, and then 
cut it into inch dice. Fry these in a stew-pan till they 
turn yellow, add the rice, and a pint and a half of broth, 
with a salt-spoonful of pepper. Simmer for twenty 
minutes, stirring the rice every now and then to prevent its 
catching at the bottom of the pan. IS'ow take it off the 
fire, and add half a pint of tomato puree or sauce. Mix 
thoroughly, and put the rice on a dish. Garnish with 
sausages, curls of fried bacon, croquettes of fish, or any 
savoury mixture you like, worked into small shapes, and 
fried a golden yellow. 

A little consideration of these recipes will, I think, show 
what a useful article of food rice may be made. In select- 
ing a recipe remember that ra^w rice of a good quality 



248 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

swells to four times its original bulk when boiled. It 
therefore requires plenty of water when undergoing that 
process. Carolina rice takes even a deeper bath than 
Patna. Two quarts of water to six ounces is a good 
proportion for the latter, and an extra pint for the same 
weight of the former. The dash of lime or lemon juice 
produces whiteness. The immediate checking of ebulli- 
tion as soon as the grains are tender causes that dis- 
integration of the grains which is a sine (jud non in well 
boiled rice. 

Indian corn (mdis) may be dressed with tomato pulp 
and grated cheese in the style of maccaroni d ritalienne, 
or riz (I Id Napolitaiiie. 



The "fondue," or "cheese son£ic," is the dish par excel- 
lence of which, when successfully made, the good cook has 
just cause to be proud. It requires the most delicate 
management, and an atom will ruin the undertaking, for 
with all sou^les, to fall short of perfection means failure. 
Practice and experience go a long way towards turning 
out this piece de residance satisfactorily, it is nevertheless 
one of those things in which the best hand may occasion- 
ally err ; so, for a dinner party, beware of placing too 
great confidence in it, have another dish ready to go round 
in case the fondue fail to " come off," and do not enter it in 
your menu. Here is the best recipe I ever read for this 
dish : — ■ 

" Melt an ounce of butter in an enamelled sauce-pan, 
and stir into it a table-spoonful of flour. When the two 
are well amalgamated, put in a breakfast-cupful of hot 
milk, and about three ounces of grated Parmesan cheese. 
Stir the mixture on a very slow fire till it assumes the 
appearance of thick cream, and beware of its becoming too 
hot, or boiling, for that would be fatal. Now, put in one 



EGGS, MACCARONI, AND CHEESE. 249 

clove of garlic, a tea-spoonful of mustard powder, a dash of 
grated nutmeg, and some black pepper. Mix thoroughly, 
and if upon tasting you find that it is required, add a little 
salt. Keep on stirring the mixture at a very moderate 
heat for quite ten minutes, then remove the garlic, take 
the sauce-pan from the fire, stirring occasionally till the 
contents are nearly cold, then add the yolks of four eggs 
previously beaten up with a table-spoonful of milk, and 
well strained ; mix well ; lastly, incorporate swiftly with 
the mixture the whites of five eggs beaten to a froth, 
pour this into a deep round tin, and put it into the oven 
which must not be too hot. From twenty to thirty minutes 
baking will make the fondue ready for the table, to which 
it must be quickly sent, in its tin, with a napkin folded 
round it."— (G. C.) 

If the early stage of preparing the fondue mixture were 
conducted in the bain-mar ie-psnij there would be no risk 
of overheating: it. 

A simpler recipe by the same author runs as follows : — 
Make a thickish paste in a sauce-pan with milk and flour, 
taking care that it is quite smooth : add to, and thoroughly 
mix with it as much grated cheese as you have used flour, 
and a little over, a small quantity of salt, a little flour of 
mustard, and some pepper. Beat up, if you have used as 
much as a pint of milk for the paste, three or four eggs. 
Incorporate them with the paste, then fill a tin, or a 
number of small cases with it, bake a nice brown colour, 
and serve. 

Brillat Savarin made a great fuss about his ^^ fondue'' 
but the dish he concocted was simply " oeufs hrouilUs ait 
fromage.'^ The modern ^^ fondue" must be baked. 

" Bainequins," or little fondues of cheese, are invariably 
popular. They are not hard to make : I choose a simple 
recipe which runs ;_thuB : — Put one ounce of butter in a 



2o0 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

roomy sance-pan, with a quarter of a pint of water, a pinch 
of salt, and a dust of black pepper ; boil it, and add two 
ounces of flour. Stir over the fire for four minutes, and 
then m.ix with it two ounces of grated Parmesan, and two 
eggs, one after the other. Put the paste thus formed on 
a buttered-baking sheet in lumps the size of a hen's egg^ 
flatten them slightly, brush them over with an egg, bake 
in the oven, and serve on a napkin very hot. 

" Ramequins en caisses'' : — Take two ounces of mild 
grated cheese, and two ounces of white bread-crumbs ; 
soak the crumbs in milk, and pound them in a mortar 
with the cheese, and a little butter, till the whole is well 
mixed ; now season the mixture with pepper and salt, add- 
ing a tea-spoonful of mustard powder, and the yolks of 
three eggs. Finally beat up the egg whites to a stiff froth, 
mingle it with the mixture, and fill your paper cases, which 
should be well buttered to prevent their burning outside, or 
*' catching" the fondue within : bake them from ten minutes 
to a quarter of an hour, and serve them as soon as they 
have raised their heads, and have slightly taken colour. 

Beignets a la Pignatelli : — Put one pint of water in 
a stew-pan with one and a half ounces of butter, season 
with salt and pepper ; boil, and add four and a half 
ounces of flour, and one ounce of grated Parmesan. Stir 
over the fire for three minutes, then add sufficient eggs to 
turn the mixture to a smooth paste. Add to the paste one 
ounce of lean cooked ham finely chopped. When mixed, 
form the paste into fritters, and fry in plenty of hot fat. 

" Beignets sov;QUs au Parmesan'' will be found elsewhere, 
and several dishes demanding cheese amongst the menus. 

N.B. — The best flour for fondues and souffles is potato 
flour, a recipe for which will be found in the menus. 
China souffle cases are nicer than paper ones.

/Votes on the Curing of Meat 

1^ different occasions in this work I have spoken of 
home-cured tongues, I now take the opportunity 
of jotting down a recipe for that useful operation, 
and of adding a few remarks upon salt meat which I 
think will be found useful. 

The general rules of this branch of kitchen work may- 
be given as follows : — 

For salting purposes you should procure a wooden tub 
sufficiently large to hold a hump, a brisket of beef, or a 
fair sized leg of mutton. 

You cannot commence operations too soon in this cli- 
mate ; the fresher the meat for pickling, the better. 

Rub the meat, after having cleaned and carefully 
wiped it, with salt, &c., at once, and take great pains that 
no part is omitted : all indentations, and holes caused by 
skewers, should be scrupulously salted. 

If you keep the meat in brine, see that it is frequently 
turned, and basted. 

A common syringe is a capital thing to use for salting 
work, — especially for large joints, — squirt the brine all 
over the meat, penetrating all cavities and chinks, 

A good pickle brine need not be wasted : after you 



252 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

have cured one joint, boil the liquid up again, skimming 
off the scum, add a little saltpetre, salt, &c., and it will 
be fit to receive another piece of meat. 

Let us now proceed to cure a tongue of from three to 
four pounds weight. For which the following ingredients 
must be prepared : — 

Best bazar salt \\ lb. 

Saltpetre 1 oz. 

Bay-salt (Ind-oopoo) 1 ,, 

Spiced pepper 1 ,, 

Moist sugar 5 ,, 

The juice of three limes and a sherry-glass of good 
vinegar ; or, if no limes be procurable, two glasses of 
vinegar. 

First, rub the tongue — after cleansing and wiping it 
thoroughly — with the bazar salt and " spiced pepper :" 
the operation will expend about a quarter of a pound of 
the former. When satisfactorily salted, put the tongue 
aside, and let it drain for the rest of the day to get rid of 
any blood that it may still contain. 

After rubbing in the salt, proceed to make the brine as 
follows : — Take a roomy enamelled sauce-pan and put in- 
to it the remaining bazar salt (about a pound) the bay- 
salt, saltpetre, the lime juice, and vinegar, and a pint and 
a half of cold water. Boil these over a low fire, removing 
all scum as it rises, when clear of scum and well boiled, 
the liquor may be set to get cold. 

Make a separate syrup with the sugar, diluting it with 
water in a small sauce-pan, and heating it gently till free 
from scum and smooth, then let it get cold. 

When the salt liquor and syrup are cold, they should 
be amalgamated, the work being done with a wooden spoon, 
and the brine being then completed should be poured into 
the tub. 



NOTES ON THE CURING OF MEAT. 253 

The tongue, having been drained for six or eight hours, 
should be placed in the brine in the evening, where it 
ought to remain for a couple of days, being frequently 
turned over and basted during that period. 

On the evening of the second day's soaking, the tongue 
must be drained from the brine, and then hung to dry in 
the smoke of the kitchen fire for a couple of days, after 
which it may be considered fit to use. Wrap it in paper 
during the smoking stage, and soak it a little before cook- 
ing in cold water. 

The above process can, of course, be depended upon for 
preserving tongues for much longer periods. I can recom- 
mend it to sportsmen who, after killing deer or bison in 
the jungle, hardly know what to do with the good meat 
thrown upon their hands. A brine tub for tongues and 
humps would not seriously increase their impedimenta, 
and a moderately quick servant could soon master the 
secret of curing. Artificial smoking can easily be manag- 
ed out in camp, and the ingredients I have named can be 
carried out of cantonment without much trouble. Never 
mind if a tongue seem to shrivel up after the smoking 
stage ; after the soaking which it must receive before 
cooking, it will revive wonderfully, and regain its original 
proportions. 

A tongue that has merely lain in brine for a couple of 
days may be cooked at once without smoking ; soaking is 
then unnecessary ; but a well smoked tongue requires 
soaking, according to the degree of dryness it may have 
attained, from two hours upwards. 

Tongues have an annoying habit of curling themselves 
round, contracting, that is to say, as they get cold after 
cooking. To combat this unsightliness, and straighten 
the tongue, Ramasamy is wont to thrust a good thick 
wooden skewer straight throngh it from end to end, which 

23 



254 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

he withdraws before sending the dish to table, the conse- 
quence of which is that you find a strange ugly cavity in 
the centre of the tongue which spoils every slice you cut 
from it. If you want to straighten a tongue properly, 
you must place it upon a clean board, — the lid of a pack- 
ing case for instance, — in the position in which tongues 
are always presented to you in England ; pin it down to 
the board by driving a strong steel carving fork through 
the root end, stretch it straight, and secure the tip by a 
sharp skewer also driven into the board : support the 
tongue in shape by weights on either side, and over the 
top of it, and let it get cold. When quite cold, you may 
release it, glaze it, let the glaze set, and then serve the 
tongue. 

'* Glaze* is not difficult to achieve if proper care be 
exercised dui*ing its making. You must boil down some 
clear strong gravy, like that laid down for " aspic jelly," 
and reduce it until it begins to thicken sufficiently to coat 
the spoon with which you are stirring it. Constant stir- 
ring is downright essential to prevent the glaze sticking 
to the bottom of the sauce-pan, and burning. As soon as 
satisfied with its consistency, pour it into a small jar. 
When cold, the glaze will solidify like hard jelly. When 
required for use, place the jar in which you have set 
it in the bain-marie and let the jelly melt ; then dip a 
brush into it, and paint the surface of the tongue, or 
joint, over thoroughly; when dry, the appearance will be 
that of a clear varnish. Colour the gravy beforehand 
with caramel according to the tint required. 

To cure a hump, brisket, aitch-bone, or piece of the 
silver side of beef, proceed as recommended for the tongue ; 
you will probably require dotlble the quantity of ingre- 
dients, but the principles are the same. Smoking is, of 
course^ not wanted, and the joint can be lifted from the 
brine on the fourth day and cooked ; scarcely any soaking 



NOTES ON THE CURING OF MEAT. 255 

will be then necessary. Syringe the brine well into the 
meat during the pickling period, and turn it frequently. 

A " mutton ham" is a capital thing for rough travelling 
times, the meat should be cured exactly as the joints of 
beef just spoken of. 

" Spiced heef is an excellent thing in its turn. Choose 
a nice brisket, or a fleshy piece of the flank for this opera- 
tion. Remove all bones. Rub the joint well with salt, 
and let it lie in the brine already described for about two 
days. Then spread it out flat, dry it, and lay a coating of 
the following spices over the inside (in the same manner 
as you would spread jam over the paste before making a 
rolypoly pudding) : — half an ounce of cloves, half an ounce 
of pepper corns (ground), half an ounce of mace, a table- 
spoonful of finely minced parsley, half one of marjoram, 
the chopped rind of a nice yellow lime, peeled very finely, 
and a dust of !N'epaul pepper : roll up the brisket and tie 
it tightly with a string. Stew it patiently until tender ; 
set it, when done, under a weight ; when cold, remove the 
string, trim the joint neatly, glaze it, and when the glaze 
is dry, the beef may be considered ready for the table. A 
couple of glasses of Madeira mixed with the liquor in 
which the beef is cooked will improve the flavour greatly. 

"Pressed heef" should come to table in a rectangular 
shape : saltpetre is not wanted in its curing as we do not 
require the red colour which is generally liked in humps, 
briskets, &c. Choose a nice fleshy piece of the flank, with 
fat and lean, pretty equally balanced. Rub it carefully 
with salt, and " spiced pepper," and let it rest in brine 
(without saltpetre) for forty-eight hours : then drain it 
dry, wipe it, and stew it gently till nice and tender. 
When done, set it on a dish with a weight above it, and 
let it get quite cold. The weight must then be removed, 
and the joint must be neatly trimmed in a rectangular 



256 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

form witli a sharp knife. Its sui'face having been glazed, 
nothing remains to be done in the kitchen. 

" Ox-head brawn' is not to be despised by dwellers in the 
plains to whom pork is denied. Skin and clean an ox- 
head, or purchase one already skinned : split it in two, cut 
out the eyes, break the bones of the jaws, remove the 
brains, and let the whole soak for an hour or two in cold 
water. Then put it into a stew-pan with water enough 
to cover it. Boil very slowly, and then add vegetables 
and flavouring as if for soup ; when the meat is quite 
tender, and you can pick the bones away from it easily, 
strain the meat from the broth, and vegetables, free it 
from every fragment of bone, and cut up the meat whilst 
it is hot and juicy, en masse rather small, seasoning it with 
salt and " spiced pepper" whilst doing so. If you have 
no spiced pepper, mix a table-spoonful of powdered dried 
thyme and marjoram blended, with a tea-spoonful of pep- 
per, and dust it freely into the meat : when seasoned well, 
cut up, and mixed, press the meat tightly down in a round 
brawn tin, and let it get cold. After which it can bo 
turned out whole, and sliced for breakfast or lunch. The 
broth in which the meat was stewed should be blended 
with the soup stock for it will be gelatinous and strong, 
the proper basis in fact for a good " mock turtle." 

An excellent " brawn' can be made with an ox-head, a 
well cured tongue, and a thick slice of bacon cut into dice. 
Stew the ox-head as in the foregoing recipe, and boil the 
tongue, cut up both with the bacon whilst they are quite 
hot, season as before explained, stir the chopped meats 
well together, press the whole tightly down in a brawn tin, 
and let it remain three or four hours with a heavy weight 
above it. When required, dip the tin into hot water to 
loosen the sides of the brawn, and it will slip out fully 
formed, and ready for the table. 

Minced ham. bacon lean, or Bolosfna sausasfe. may be

sprinkled in witli the seasoning. Be careful to cut up 
and work your brawn together whilst the meat is quite 
hot. Unless this be done, the brawn will not solidify 
satisfactorily. Turn the meat into the tin as soon as you 
can. Use an ordinary round cake tin, and place a heavy 
weight over the meat to press it firmly together. 

Calves' heads make delicious brawn when associated 
with ox tongue and bacon, and judiciously seasoned. 

For brawn of pig's head, follow the rules already given 
for ox-head brawn.

Pastry-making, et cetera. 

LTHOUGH it is generally admitted that the clever 
pastry-cook is, like the Poet, born, not made ; or, 
in other words, that the art of making really good 
pastry is a gift, rather than an accomplishment, there can 
be no doubt that the chef of average capacity is capable 
of improving himself by studying the rules which govern 
this branch of his profession. Raraasamy stands in great 
need of instruction here, for his ideas of pastry are, as a 
rule, crude in the extreme. He is acquainted apparently 
with two standard compositions alone, which he distin- 
guishes by the terms " butter crust," and " suet crust." 
The former is a kind of short bread, the latter a humble 
apology for pufE paste. His selection of the one or of the 
other, if left to himself, is guided by one law : — " butter 
crust" for sweet things, and " suet crust" for savoury. 
Concerning the former I have but little to say. In my 
opinion it is so very inferior to puff paste, that I recommend 
its use in no branch of cookery whatever. If a cook be 
wholly incapable of making eatable puff pastry, he may, of 
course, be permitted to fall back upon his " butter crust," 
but I would never allow him to do so unless quite satisfied 
of his incompetence. " Suet crust," on the other hand, is 
the " subject of my story" for I think that with a little 
careful teaching Ramasamy is capable of achieving very 
fair results with it. 



PASTRY-MAKING, ET CETERA. 259 

Kow, I think that it would be a mere waste of time to 
jot down a great number of recipes for pastry. The ordi- 
nary domestic cookery book generally contains a dozen or 
more of them which tend, I think, to confuse rather than 
to instruct the student. In endeavouring to improve our 
native cooks, we should certainly cast aside all complica- 
tion, and reduce our instruction to the simplest formulae. 
So, let us do our best to confine their attention to three 
compositions as follows : — 

(a) puff paste. 

(h) pie-crust. 

(c) raised pie-crust. 

The first to be used for the vol-au-vent, all patties, bou" 
chees, fruit tarts, tartlets, puffs, cheese cakes, mince pies, 
&c., &G. 

The second for all savoury pies made in the ordinary 
pie-dish, such as pigeon pie, chicken and beef steak pie, 
&c., &c. 

The third for savoury pies in raised crust, like the well- 
known pork pie, veal and ham pie, &c., of the English 
restaurant. 

If a cook can present a good sample of each of these 
pastes, he need not bother his head with varieties. Let us 
then run through the ' a. b. c' of pastry-making, and make 
sure that our chef thoroughly understands the elementary 
part of this branch of his work : — 

First, if you can possibly get one, you should use a 
marble pastry slab. As I said at page 72, in Madras the 
chief difl&culty the pastry-maker has to contend against is 
the high temperature : a jugful of iced water poured slowly 
over the surface of the slab (since marble retains cold far 
more readily than wood) is his surest safeguard. In fact, 
without iced water at his elbow, the cook can scarcely 
hope to turn out really light puff pastry. I have heard a 



260 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

good many people speak in high praise of the pastry that 
they have eaten at certain hostelries on the Neilgherries, 
and express wonder that similarly excellent feuilletage is 
never placed before them here. Climate has a great deal 
to say to this, and without wishing to depreciate the ta- 
lent of the Coonoor or Ooty pdtissiers, we must remember 
the advantages that they enjoy in the matter of tempera- 
ture. 

The next golden rule is that which enjoins scrupulous 
cleanliness. Everything connected with this department 
must be as bright and clean as possible. 

A third law, which I think our cooks rarely obey, is the 
one that demands the careful weighing of ingredients. 
Ramasamy converses about " cups" of butter and " table- 
spoonfuls" of flour. I do not think that he is nearly 
particular enough with regard to the accurate weight of 
the things he uses. Carelessness in this matter must 
obviously be the precui'sor of failure. 

The mere manipulation of pastry is, as I said before, a 
gift ; still, every cook should remember that the less ho 
thumps and mauls the dough the lighter it will be, and 
that the quicker the work is done the better. 

The pastry-maker should wash his hands before going 
to work in very hot water, and plunge them into iced 
water afterwards, drying them well before proceeding to 
business. The frequent use of iced water to cool the 
hands while working will contribute to the success of the 
undertaking. 

It is here essential to observe that a little practice will 
enable the cook to mix his dough, in the first instance with 
two strong wooden spoons, or with a wedgewood mortar 
pestle and one spoon. This I consider a matter of material 
consequence. Setting aside all hypercritical notions of 
cleanliness, it stands to reason that the less the paste is 



PASTRY-MAKING, ET CETERA. 261 

touched by the warm human hand, the better and lighter 
it will prove. Similarly, therefore, let the turns in the 
rolling-out stage be done with two spoons. If the mixing 
stage were carried out in a roomy enamelled iron pan, or 
bowl, set in ice, the spoon process could be easily managed. 

Pastry should be made, if possible, in the morning before 
the real heat of the day has set in. Fruit tarts are far 
nicer cold than hot, why not make them early then ? Or 
if you like them served hot, why not re-heat them in the 
oven at the time they are required ? For patties, bouchees, 
timhales, tartlets, cheese-cakes, &c., this course is strongly 
to be advocated. The pastry cases ought to be made early, 
baked at once and put away ; in the evening they should 
be filled with the salpicon, pitrSe, jam, cheese-cake mixture, 
or confiture^ be re-heated in the oven, and sent to table. 

A most important feature in pastry is its baking. Too 
slack, or too fierce an oven, will destroy all the careful 
work I have just described. A good hot oven is required, 
sufficiently brisk to raise the pastry, yet not severe enough 
to burn or even scorch it. Ramasamy is inclined to err 
on the side of extreme heat, which, I think, accounts for 
those harsh, talc-like slabs of pale brown crust, piled up 
one on top of the other, which so many of us are forced to 
accept as " puff-paste." The higher that these layers of 
talc have " done raise it uff," the more successful does 
Ramasamy consider himself . " Erroneous vassal !" Puff- 
pastry cannot be too white, or too volatile ; so fragile 
indeed should it be that it ought e'en to crumble to atoms 
if stricken with a feather. 

And now for a few words touching ingredients : — 

The flour used should be the best imported, and in a 
moist climate, such as this, it is a sine qua non that it 
should be dried in the oven and sifted to begin with, for 
the presence of damp in flour ruins pastry. 

24 



262 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 



Oue of the chief causes of failure in attaininsr lis^ht 
crust is tlie moisture and oiliness of our butter. All 
Madras-made butter is full of water, and even English 
butter requires close pressure before the pastrj-cook dare 
use it. Butter for this pui'pose should be firm, not frozen 
like a stone, but quite hard enough to cut into pieces. A 
judicious use of ice for this ingredient is therefore unavoid- 
ble if you desire to use it with success in pastry. It is on 
this account, I fancy, that Ramasamy has discovered that 
suet makes lighter puff paste in this climate than butter : 
it is firm, dry, and capable of being chopped up and 
strewn over the dough ; Avhereas, in nineteen cases out of 
twenty, the butter he uses is in a semi-state of liquefac- 
tion, and utterly unfit to mix with the flour. 

If, then, you cannot command a good supply of excel- 
lent butter, and imdertake that it shall be iced as I have 
described, you will find it better far, as a rule, to use 
clarified beef suet for all ordinary pastry. Proceed in this 
way : procure as much good, pale yellow, fresh suet from a 
sirloin of beef (that surrounding the kidney is the best), and 
cut it into pieces. Place a large sauce-pan or stew-pan on 
the fire, and fill it nearly full of water ; when the water 
boils, throw in the fat. By degrees it will melt, the skin 
and impure fragments will sink, and a rich oil will float 
upon the surface of the water, which should be kept at a 
simmering pitch. When satisfied that the whole of the fat 
has melted, suspend operations, take the pan from the fire, 
and let it get cold ; when cold, the clarified fat will become 
congealed upon the sui'face of the water. Now, take it oJQE 
in flakes, drain every drop of water from it, and put it 
into a clean sauce-pan ; melt it again, and strain it through 
a piece of muslin into an earthenware bowl. The fat will 
again consolidate, — in a firm, pale yellow cake, as it were, — 
far harder than butter, though quite as sweet and clean, 
and the very thing you want for ordinary pastry and 



PASTRY-MAKING, ET CETERA. 263 

delicate saute work. Suet thus clarified will keep perfect- 
ly good a long time, and is infinitely cleaner and nicer 
than raw suet freshly handled by the butcher, and good- 
ness knows by how many other people. 

Keep the bowl of suet in a cool place ; in the ice-box if 
possible. 

The fat that is skimmed from the surface of the soup- 
kettle is just as valuable, for it is generally the melted 
marroiv from the broken shin : you do not get much of it, 
I know, probably a breakfast-cupful, at the outside, but 
it is quite first-rate, and the favourite frying medium of 
the great Careme. The fat from the under-cut of a cold 
roast sirloin can be made use of exactly in the same way 
as the raw suet : clarify it according to the rules already 
given, and pour it into an earthenware bowl. 

Lard is imported here during the colder months of the 
year ; it requires the assistance of ice to regain its original 
firmness of character, and then, if carefully used, it 
affords an excellent ingredient wherewith to compose a 
good light pie-crust. 

As I said before, the water used in pastry-making 
should certainly be slightly iced : it need not be as cold 
as that we like to drink, but it should be decidedly cold 
to the touch. 

For PUFF PASTE the following directions may, I think, 
be depended upon : — 

Having the following ingredients ready : — a bowl of 
cold, well clarified suet, some dry well-sifted flour, a good 
ripe lime, some salt, and a jug of iced water, proceed as 
follows : — weigh a pound of flour, and turn it out upon 
your cold marble slab, make a hollow in its centre, and 
fill it with half an ounce of salt, and a quarter of a pint of 
the cold water ; mix the flour gradually with the water, 



264 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

and when this is done, and the paste half mixed, sprinkle 
over it another quarter pint of water in which the lime 
has been squeezed. Mix it all now thoroughly, until it 
ceases to adhere to the slab, and pat it into a round ball. 
Now take one pound weight of the clarified suet, cut it 
up into dice, and flatten out the ball of paste to a thick- 
ness of about two inches, spreading the suet evenly over 
its surface ; then fold the four sides of the paste to the 
centre enclosing the suet, and forming a square piece. 
Roll this evenly out a yard long, then fold over one-third 
of the length towards the centre, and fold the other third 
over it. This folding in three is called by cooks " giving 
the paste one tui^n." Be careful that none of the suet 
breaks through the edges of the paste as you roll it out. 
Having folded up the paste, let it rest for ten minutes in 
the ice-box, or on a very cold slab. Then give it two 
turns, rest ten minutes, then two turns more, — five rolls 
out in all, — lastly, gather the paste into a lump, and roll 
it according to your requirements. 

For patties, vols-au-veiif, ^'c, seven turns are recom- 
mended by some authors. Keep the flour dredger at your 
elbow, and flour the rolling-pin well before each turn. 
The sooner the paste is used when it has been completed 
the better. 

If you have a little good iced butter, you may alter the 
above proportions as follows : — three-quarters of a pound 
of suet, and one-quarter of a pound of butter. The yolks 
of two eggs well beaten and strained may be mixed with 
the water. 

Baking powder may be used advantageously in pastry- 
making : here is Yeatman & Co.'s recipe for puff paste 
made in connection with their powder : — 

Measure three breakfast-cupfuls of flour, carefully sifted, 
and two cupfuls of butter. Choose a cool place to work 



PASTRY-MAKING, ET CETERA. 265 

in, see that the flour is good and dry, the butter firm and 
free from moisture, and fill two shallow baking-tins with 
broken ice. Put the flour on a cool sla,b, mixing into it a 
heaped up tea-spoonful of the baking powder ; when mixed, 
form the flour in a, ring, as it were, and in the centre 
throw the yolk of an egg and a tea-spoonful of salt ; add 
a little iced water, and gradually work the flour into it 
from the inside of the ring, sprinkling additional water 
as you require it — about one breakfast- cupful altogether — 
until you have a smooth, fine dough, free from all sticki- 
ness. Pat this into a lump, and put it in the ice-box for 
a quarter of an hour, then roll it out about the size of a 
dinner plate : put the butter upon it, and wrap the edges 
of the dough over it, carefiilly covering it : now turn it 
upside down, and roll it out very thin ; reverse it again, 
and fold it in three. Place it after this on a baking-sheet 
over one of the pans of broken ice, and put the other pan 
of ice iipon it. Repeat this cooling process between each 
double turn, and use as soon as possible when five turns 
have been completed. 

Although composed for English and American kitchens, 
observe the use of ice advocated in this receipt. Instead 
of the butter I would try the clarified beef suet, that is to 
say, if I were unable to procure butter of undeniable 
quality, firm, cold, and quite free from water. 

The next description of pastry that demands our atten- 
tion is that which should be used for savoury pies, to 
^it : — PIE -CRUST. In this, I think, Ramasamy needs care- 
ful instruction. He makes no difference between his sa- 
voury pie " suet-crust," and that which he sends up under 
the name of a vol-au-vent. His chief aim being a pie- 
covering, raised an inch and a half or two inches high, 
composed of the harsh, talc-like layers to which I have 
already alluded. I need hardly point out that this is an 
entirely erroneous impression. Think of the cold pigeon- 



266 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 



pie at home, and you will remember no 'puff pastry : your 
mind's eye will rather picture a close crust about half, or 
three-quarters of an inch thick, glazed externally, with 
c^gt and with the feet of the birds peeping' invitingly from 
the centre : a firm plain paste that you cut out in a whole 
piece without its breaking into fragments ; pale brown 
and crusty externally, and soft and white internally, with 
bits of jelly adhering to it. Well, that is the kind of 
crust that I am so anxious to impart to Ramasamy, for 
which the following recipe is, I think, reliable : — 

Put one pound of well-dried and sifted flour on the slab, 
or in an enamelled basin ; make a hollow in the centre, and 
work into it a quarter of a pound of cold clarified suet 
cut into pieces, adding a tea-spoonful of salt. When mix- 
ed, sprinkle over it as much iced water as will bind it 
thoroughly : dredge some flour over the slab, and roll the 
paste out half an inch thick. Cut up another quarter of 
a pound of clarified suet, and dot it over the surface of 
the paste, fold the paste over it, and roll it out again very 
thin ; fold it in three, set it in the ice-box for ten minutes, 
give it three more turns, and then roll it out half an inch 
thick when it may be cut to cover the pie. 

A French savoury pie-crust is made in this way : — 
Empty a pound of flour into a bowl, and rub lightly into 
it half a pound of clarified suet ; add a tea-spoonful of 
salt, and complete the dough by adding to it by degrees a 
quarter of a pint of water in which two eggs have been 
beaten. Roll the paste out, give it two or three turns, 
and finish it as in the foregoing receipt. 

A plainer crust can be made by reducing the suet, and a 
richer and more volatile one by adding a couple of ounces 
or so of iced butter. 

Raised pie-crust, or number three, is perhaps less 
understood by Ramasamy than the other kinds that 1 have 



PASTRY-MAKING, ET CETERA. 267 

mentioned. It is a thing that people rarely attempt in 
this country under an impression, I fancy, that it is too 
difficult for the Indian chef. Yet, as a matter-of-fact, 
nothing can be more simple. Pies of this kind are inex- 
pensive, and whether for breakfast, the luncheon table, or 
the pic-nic basket, cannot be too highly commended. To 
be certain of success it is advisable to procure a raised pie- 
tin, which shoidd have movable sides secured by a pin at 
either end so that the pie may be easily released when 
baked. A locally made tin of the following size will, in 
the absence of a proper utensil, be found useful : — Oval 
in shape, six inches and a half long and five inches across 
(top measurement), five and a half inches long, and four 
inches across (bottom measurement) : a movable bottom 
to fit the latter : depth of tin three and a half inches. The 
bazar tin-man will turn you out one of these tins in a few 
hours for a trifling sum. Made in a mould of this shape, 
the pie is, of course, larger at the top than at the bottom, 
with sloping sides. Having procured a tin, you should 
make the following short " pork-pie crust" to fit it : — 

Put half a pint of water into a sauce-pan, and let it boil ; 
when boiling, stir into it a quarter of a pound of clarified 
suet, and one ounce of fresh butter with a tea-spoonful of 
salt. Stir till the fat has melted, and then pour the con- 
tents of the sauce-pan, boiling hot, into a bowl containing 
a pound and a half of well-dried flour. Work the mixture 
to a stiff paste adding a little water, if necessary, and turn 
it out upon a cold pastry slab ; roll it out three-quarters 
of cin inch thick, as evenly and level as possible, and let 
it get quite cold. Now, butter the tin, and cut an oval 
piece of paste a little larger than the bottom of it so that 
the edges may turn up, and be more readily fixed to the 
wall, or side-paste ; next cut out a strip three and a half 
inches wide, and sufficiently long to go round the inside 
of the wall of the tin ; fix the bottom of the wall to the 



268 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

oval piece at the bottom -with white of Qgg^ pinching them 
closely together ; then fill the pie with whatever meat 
you have prepared, covering it over with an oval cap, cnt 
like the bottom piece, cementing it with white of Qggi and 
pinching it tightly to the top of the wall : brush the pie 
over with white of egg and bake it in a slow oven. Little 
pies require a slightly faster oven than large ones, but all 
raised pies should be slowly baked. 

This receipt for raised pie-crust is a Leicestershire one, 
and will be found similar to that used for pork-pies in that 
county. 

Fate brisee crust, as used by French cooks for raised 
savoury pies, is composed by working the suet and butter 
into the dry flour before any liquid is added. Eight ounces 
of iced butter, or clarified beef suet, should be allowed for 
a pound of flour, a tea-spoonful of salt, and sufficient water 
to mix a very stiff dough. 

You can fill up these pies in many ways, here are a few 
recipes : — 

(a.) With mutton, a plain pie : — Choose a first class neck 
of mutton, cut the meat from the bones in one piece, divide 
that into slices an inch thick, and cut them into squares 
as for a dry curry, keeping the fat and lean separate : 
if the neck be a lean one, a few pieces of nice kidney fat 
from the loin may be taken to assist the pie : thoroughly 
season the meat, when it is cut up, with salt, black pepper, 
and a table-spoonful of chopped curled parsley, — nothing 
else upon any account. With this the pie should be packed, 
as closely as possible, in alternate layers of fat and lean. 
Unlike ordinary pies, in this case you must not pour in 
any gravy ivith the meat: the chief thing is the close 
arrangement of the meat : if put in loosely the outside 
pieces will be dry and leathery. When satisfactorily fill- 
ed, put on the oval cover, cement the edges with white of 



PASTRY-MAKING, ET CETERA. 2G9 

egg, and pinch tliem together firmly, brush the top orei' 
with a well-beaten egg, and bake the pie in a slow oven. 
While baking, jon can simmer the bones and trimmings 
of the neck, with a couple of sheep's feet cleaned and cut 
up, and make a clear yet strong broth ; this, when cold, 
should solidify as jelly ; flavour it with pepper and salt, 
and after the pie has been baked, pour a little of it through 
an opening in the top of the cover. Set the pie in the ice- 
box, and when quite cold, serve. 

(h.) With pork, when you can get it clean-fed as on 
the Hills, the process is similar to that just explained : 
choose the neck, and omit the parsley : the seasoning for 
pork pies is composed of black pepper and salt only, the 
proportion being two-thirds of the latter to one of the 
former. Receipts that mention sage, &c., are incorrect. 
Pack the pieces of meat as closely as you can, and bake 
the pie very slowly : a little liquid jelly made from 
pettitoes and pork scraps may be poured in after the 
baking, but no gravy should be added before that operation. 

(c.) With game. If made with game, the birds should 
be boned, and some pieces of chopped bacon should be 
introduced here and there. Season with spiced pepper, 
and pour some liquid jelly (made from the bones, trim- 
m.ings, and a couple of sheep's feet) into the pie after it 
has been baked. A liver and bacon forcemeat (vide page 
70) is also necessary. 

For a specially good game-pie, proceed as follows : — 

Bone two partridges, two quails, and four snipes, and 
cut out the back fillets of a good hare ; give the meat a 
dusting of spiced pepper, and cover it up. Next make a 
forcemeat as follows : — Take the livers of the birds and 
that of the hare, and mince them finely ; mince the spare 
meat of the hare, and a quarter of a pound of ham, and 
throw the whole of the mince into a frying-pan, in which 

25 



270 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

half a pound of fat bacon cut into dice has been tossed 
with a finely chopped shallot. Work the mince about for 
ten minutes, then empty the contents of the frying-pan 
into a mortar, and pound the mixture to a paste. IsTow 
cut eight fine truffles into dice the size of a pea, melt 
an ounce of butter in the frying-pan, and throw in the 
truffles ; toss for a couple of minutes, and add a claret- 
glassful of Madeira ; let the dice boil in this, and then 
pour them with the liquor into a bowl. Yon can now pack 
the pie as follows :— 

Spread a layer of liver paste over the inside of eacli 
bird, put a spoonful of truffles upon it, and roll the bird 
up ; cut the hare into slices, and treat them in the same 
way : next put a layer of the liver paste over the bottom 
of the pie, dot it over with truffles, arrange the rolls of hare 
meat over that, spread some liver paste over them, a few^ 
truffles, and some thin slices of fat bacon : next aiTange a 
layer of snipe, and continue until the pie is tightly filled ; 
cover the topmost layer with fat bacon, sprinkled over 
with marjoram leaves, cover the pie closely and bake. 
When done, pour into it a little very strong jelly (lique- 
fied) made of the bones and trimmings of the game, two 
sheep's feet, and the truffle liquor. 

It must be here observed that raised pies should not be 
made during the hot weather ; unless eaten immediately 
they soon turn sour ; but they will be found capital on the 
Hills, at Bangalore, and on the plains during the cold 
season. 

Savoury Puddings, though homely, and perhaps hardly 
to be recommended for dinner parties, are, in their way, 
not to be despised. The best paste for them, I think, is 
one made as follows : — Chop very finely six ounces of clari- 
fied suet, and dredge a little flour over it as you mince it. 
Mix with it one pound of flour, a tea-spoonful of salt, and 



PASTRY-MAKING, ET CETERA. 271 

sufficient water to make a smooth, pliant paste. Roll it 
out, and it will be ready for use. A basin is the best thing 
to use for the boiling : rub it well with butter, line it with 
the paste rolled at least half an inch thick, close over the 
top securely, tie the basin up with a cloth, and steam the 
pudding slowly for three hours. To ensure success, a 
pudding cannot be too slowly boiled. 

A really excellent beefsteak pudding can be made by 
preparing the beef as laid down for pies, viz. : — 

Cut the meat into thin collops, place a thin slice of cold 
cooked bacon over each collop, season this with spiced 
pepper, and roll each collop up. Line the pudding basin 
with paste, and fill it with layers of collops, pour in among 
the collops a little strong gravy, close the paste securely 
and boil for three houi's. 

For BEEFSTEAK AND OYSTER PUDDING, roll an oystcr inside 
each collop. For beefsteak and kidney, cut the kidney 
into strips and treat them in the same way, rolling slices 
of kidney and bacon inside each collop. 

Excellent puddings are made with birds, boned, and 
rolled up with a slice of bacon, and any nice stuffing, inside 
them. Take a brace of partridges, for instance, and bone 
them, lay them out flat, putting a few thin slices of cooked 
bacon over them, over that strew some chopped mush- 
rooms, their livers chopped, a little minced shallot, and a 
good dusting of spiced pepper ; roll the birds up and put 
them into the pudding basin, pour in a little rich gravy 
made from their bones, &c., close the paste over them, and 
boil for three hours. This is obviously practicable with 
any game. 







-—- ♦■ 
A few nice Pies. 

^THlhY. in the liigh art studies of this braucli of 



V'V^ culinary science, the clever cook finds grand 
opportunities of displaying his skill, he possesses 
in its humbler subjects a ready method of practising 
economy, and of exercising his inventive ability. The 
savoury pie is indeed an admirable institution. In no 
manner can odds and ends of good food be more satisfac- 
torily disposed of. AVe like a hot pie, "vve like a cold pie ; 
it is welcome at breakfast, at luncheon, or at dinner ; at 
the pic-nic, the wedding breakfast, or the ball supper. 
And yet it must be confessed that we rarely eat a pie in 
India that can be compared with an ordinary home-made 
pasty in England. The superiority of British meat may, 
no doubt, account for this failure to a certain extent, and 
the climate of the " plain country" may be against us, but 
I think the chief diflSculty is susceptible of removal if we 
study the laws of pie-making and teach our cooks accord- 
ing to them. 

A very common fault committed by Ramasamy in his 
concoction of a pie, is this : — he is apt, unless taught other- 
wise, to cook, or partly cook, the meat of which it is made 
lefore covering it with paste, and baking it. It is, I hope, 
unnecessary for me to point out that this is an altogether 
erroneous proceeding. Whatever materials you may choose 
— pigeons, chicken, steak, or game, — see thnt they are 



A FEW NICE PIES. 273 

laid in the pie-dish uncooked, and properly covered with 
paste according to the correct laws of cookery. Previously 
cooked meat may very often be made use of in a pie, I 
grant, but a good ' pasty' can hardly be produced if the 
whole of its contents have been dressed beforehand. 

Having selected the meat for your pie, the first thing to 
remember is the gravy which must be made separately, 
and part of it poured in and amongst the layers in the pie- 
dish before the paste is laid over it. A little wine lends 
valuable aid to such gravies : the remains of a good bottle 
of champagne can be used with great advantage in pigeon- 
pies, chicken and ham pies, &c., and Madeira is wanted 
for game, venison, and hare pies. The gravy ought not 
to^ZZthe pie-dish; about a breakfast-cupful will suffice 
for a pie of moderate size in the first instance. 

Prohibit most strenuously the use of Worcester, Tapp, 
or cmij strongly flavoured sauce of that kind : it is owing 
to Ramasamy's predilection for the sauce bottle that one 
peculiar kind of taste prevails throughout his dishes, in 
his savoiu-y pies especially. 

The seasoning is a matter demanding close attention : 
here the " spiced pepper" described at page 111 will be 
found of great assistance ; and minced mushrooms, minced 
truffles, and minced olives, (made from remnants you may 
have saved after an important day's cooking) will come 
in most efficaciously. Finely chopped liver is a capital 
thing to shake over the crevices when building a pie, and 
little bits of chopped anchovy may be similarly used. 
Ham and tongue, either sliced, or grated, is welcome in 
every kind of ' pasty,' bacon is almost as effective, and 
sliced Bologna sausage a very good substitute. 

Always rub your pie-dish with a shallot, before pack- 
ing it. 

It is customary to garnish the surface of a savoury pie 



274 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

with quarters of liard-boiled eggs : if you have a few 
button mushrooms, you can use them for that pui-pose also, 
and strew some finely minced parsley over the whole. 

The cupful of gravy should be poured gently into the 
packed pie-dish the last thing, just to moisten the contents 
as it were. 

Assuming that the cook can make a good light pie-crust, 
and that the dish has been neatly covered in therewith, 
care must be taken about the state of the oven : — if too 
slack, the crust will be heavy and dull, and if too hot, it 
will be burnt before the pie is completely cooked. The 
oven should be so hot that you cannot quite bear your 
hand inside it. 

Always leave an aperture in the centre of your pie- 
crust, which you can cover with an ornamental device in 
pastry towards the end of the baking. This is necessary 
as a vent for the escape of the gas which the cooking of 
the meat generates, and also as an opening through which 
you can pour the rest of your gravy as a finishing touch 
after the pie is quite baked. The glazing of the crust 
should be done towards the end of the baking by brushing 
a well beaten up egg over its surface. 

If you bear these general rules in mind, I am sure that 
you will soon experience a marked improvement in the 
savoury pies that your cook may in future place before you. 

There ought to be little or no difficulty in flavouring a 
pie even though circumstances may render it impossible 
for you to compose the really good gravy which I have 
recommended as so highly essential. Take an ordinary 
" chicken and beef-steak pie" for instance : there ought to 
be some scraps left after cutting the beef to fit the pie-dish, 
and there must be some valuable trimmings available 
for broth-making when you have cut up and di'essed the 
chicken — the neck, pinions, legs and feet, giblets, &c. 



A FEW NICE PIES. 275 

With these materials the cook should make a fairly good 
broth, flavouring it with an onion, and any fragments of 
vegetable he may have at hand, a little mushroom ketch- 
up, some pepper corns, a dessert-spoonful of mixed dried 
herbs, the peel of a lime, a tea-spoonful of anchovy sauce 
or an anchovy finely chopped, a dessert-spoonful of vine- 
gar, a pinch of sugar, and salt to taste. When the scraps 
and bones have simmered secundum artem under careful 
supervision for an hour, a dash of Madeira may be stirred 
into the sauce-pan, and in a few minutes the broth may 
be strained off into a bowl. As soon as the fat, that the 
liquid may throw up, has been removed, the cook will have 
at his command a very excellent substitute for real gravy 
wherewith to moisten the contents of his j^ie : far better, 
at all events, than the water and Worcester sauce which 
Ramasamy is generally contented to use. 

A recipe for a really good " beef- steak pie" will be found 
in Menu No. 28, and the following notes concerning a " Do- 
mestic Pastij" will, I think, commend themselves to house- 
keepers who know what it is to find a few pounds of good 
meat on their hands without an idea of what to do with 
them. 

When staying on the Hills some time ago, a question 
one day arose touching what could be done with the 
remains of a fine saddle of mutton. There was a piece of 
good cold-boiled pickled pork in the house, about a pound 
of gravy beef could be spared from the soup meat, and a 
nice chicken was also available. I decided upon making 
a pie. Having called for the saddle, I began by cutting 
as many slices as I could from the meat that remained 
untouched at the tail end : each slice was trimmed free 
from burnt skin, &c., and laid upon a separate plate. 
About a pound and a half of these slices having been 
obtained, I next cut off all remnants of good lean that still 
adhered to the bones, and put them into a bowl. The 



276 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

bones were then broken np, and cast into a large stew- 
pan with every atom of skin, fat, gristle, &c., that I could 
find left in the dish after the trimming operation. The 
whole saddle was thus disposed of. Into the stew-pan 
with the mutton bones, and scraps, I threw six shallots, a 
dozen pepper corns, the peel of a lime, two carrots cut up, 
a buncli of parsley, a coarse stalk of celer}- with its leaves, 
a table-spoonful of mushroom ketchup, a bouquet of sweet 
herbs, the aforesaid pound of gi^avy beef cut up, and all 
the trimmings of the chicken, — neck, legs, feet, pinions 
and giblets. Having been covered with warm water, and 
simmered gently, in about three hours these various ingre- 
dients produced a pint and a half of very excellent broth 
which was strained off, and set to cool. The lean remnants 
which had been saved in the bowl were now pounded witli 
a couple of anchovies in the mortar, and passed through the 
sieve. When the broth was quite cold, the fat was skim- 
med off, and a regular jmree made with it and the pounded 
mutton. It was now time to pack the pie-dish, which was 
done in this way : — first a sprinkling of finely minced 
parsley, then a double layer of sliced mutton, over that a 
layer of sliced lean pork, another of mutton, and so on 
alternately, till there was just enough space left to accom- 
modate the joints of the raw chicken : these were neatly 
disposed on the top, with little bits of lean pork dotted in 
between them : the sui-f ace was garnished with hard-boiled 
eggs cut into quarters, and then the 'puree was patiently 
poured over everything, time being given for the liquid 
to settle in and amongst the contents of the pie-dish : 
when finished, the gravy came within an inch of the top 
of the pie : parsley minced small was shaken over the 
surface as a last touch. The cook now made the paste, 
and covered in the ' pasty' ; it was baked, and at the end 
of the baking, some of the puree., which had been saved 
for the purpose, was gently poured into the pie through 



A FEW NICE PIES. 277 

the vent in tlie centre of the crust. An ornamental flower 
cut in paste was placed over the aperture, the crust was 
glazed, and in due course the dish was ready for the 
table. 

Observe the absence of any ready-made sauce in the con- 
coction of this simple composition. A little ' spiced pepper' 
was sprinkled over the layers of meat, and some very finely 
chopped thyme and marjoram, — about a tea-spoonful in 
all, — was shaken over them also. The joints of chicken 
were those usually cut up for a curry. When cold, this 
pie was really excellent ; there was not a bit of grease in 
it ; the meat lay prettily embedded in a delicious jelly ; and 
the flavour was exactly that of an ordinary home-made pie 
in England. I did not put in any wine ; I had no mush- 
rooms, and nothing expensive was used. Instead of the 
lean pickled pork, — ham, leanish bacon, tongue, sliced 
Bologna sausage, or even slices of juicy corned beef, might 
have been used. A little consideration will enable the 
composer to vary both the contents and the flavour of his 
pies from time to time. 

Lock up the Worcester sauce, and trust to the meat, 
herbs, and good gravy to produce a happy result. 

Bearing in mind the rules I have given, and remember- 
ing what was done in the case of the " Domestic Fie' just 
described, I think you may undertake any of the follow- 
ing standard pies without any apprehension : — 

1. ^^ Beef-steaJc and Oyster Pie.'' — Follow the recipe 
given in Menu No. 28 as far as the cutting up of the beef 
is concerned, and the rolling up within each collop of a 
nice piece of boiled bacon. Place at the bottom a layer of 
beef collops, then a layer of oysters drained from the tin 
liquor, beef again, oysters again, and so on, till the dish is 
packed : season with " spiced pepper" and finely minced 
lime peel. The gravy must be made thus : — To about a 

26 



278 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

pint of good beef gravy, add the liquor you strained from 
the tin of oysters, the rind of a lime, a blade of mace, .a 
glass of sherry and a table-spoonfnl of walnnt or mushroom 
ketchup ; heat up gently, skimming off the scum which 
the oyster liquor may throw up, and when thoroughly 
blended, strain the gi'avy off, and pour it into your packed 
pie-dish, reserving about a coffee-cupful to pour through 
the top of the crust at the end of the baking. 

2. " Chicken and Tonrjue Fie.'' — A chicken, an ox tongue, 
and six mutton cutlets from the neck. Cut up a chicken 
as if for cui-ry, slice up a cold-boiled, home-cui'ed tongue, 
and trim six nice mutton cutlets from the neck as if for 
an entree. Throw the chicken scraps, the tongue skin and 
trimmings, and all the remnants of mutton left after shap- 
ing the cutlets, into a large sauce-pan with the materials 
for gravy flavouring recommended in the recipe for the 
•' Domestic Tie,'' and make a nice broth with them ; when 
the broth is nearly ready, give it half a glass of Madeira, 
and strain when it is finished. Pack the pie thus : — a dust 
of chopped parsley at the bottom, then the mutton cutlets, 
above them the slices of tongue, and the chicken at the toj). 
Poui' in the gravy, garnish the top with hard-boiled eggs, 
cover the pie with a good crust, and bake. 

3. " Rabbit Pie.'' — One good sized rabbit, half a pound 
of bacon, forcemeat, and a pound of gravy beef. Skin 
and wash a fine rabbit, cut it up in the usual way as if for 
a stew, and put the pieces to soak in cold water. When 
quite clean, drain them, wipe them dry with a clean cloth, 
and set them aside. Put the head, the lower joints of the 
legs, and all scraps of the rabbit, with the beef, and the 
usual ingredients for flavouring a gravy already laid down, 
into a large sauce-pan, and make the best gi^avy you can 
with them for the pie. When this has been done to your 
satisfaction, and the fat has been skimmed off the surface 
of the liquor, proceed in this way : — Make a plain force- 



A FEW NICE PIES. 279 

meat as described for turkey, mingling with it tlie liver 
and kidneys of tlie rabbit very finely chopped, and spread a 
thin layer of it at the bottom of the pie-dish ; immediately 
above it put a layer of bacon slices, then the coarser joints 
of the rabbit, dusting them with " spiced pepper," and 
filling the interstices between the pieces with forcemeat ; 
put a second layer of bacon over the rabbit, and rabbit 
again above that, repeat the forcemeat dressing, and when 
the pie-dish is full, pour in the gravy till it almost reaches 
the level of the topmost layer. Grarnish as usual, cover 
the pie with paste, and bake ; time, if the oven be in a 
proper condition, about one hour and a quarter, 

4. " Hare Pie." — This should be made like the fore- 
going ' pasty' exactly, with two slight variations, viz. : — a 
glass of port, half a glass of good vinegar, with a dessert- 
spoonful of red currant jelly should be mixed into the 
gravy, and a little pounded mace may be sprinkled over 
the meat in addition to the ordinary spiced pepper, 

5. " Pigeon Pie.'^ — A pound and a, half of tender lean 
beef to three good pigeons, half a pound of leanish bacon, 
and a pound of gravy beef. The process is not very 
different from that of the pies already described. You 
must make the best gravy possible from the pound of 
gravy meat, the pigeon trimmings, and any scraps at hand. 
The pigeons should be placed upon the tender beef, which 
should be cut into neat collops and blended with the bacon 
cut into thin strips as propounded for " beef-steak pie," 
Menu No. 28. Do not cut the pigeons in halves : let them 
be prepared whole as if for roasting, and put some chopped 
bacon seasoned with pepper, salt, or " spiced pepper," 
salt, and grated lime peal, inside each bird. Half a glass 
of Madeira or any sound white wine may be mingled with 
the gravy, the pie- dish should be rubbed with a shallot 
before it is packed, finely chopped parsley should be 
sprinkled over the bottom of the dish before the beef 



280 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

collops are arranged upon it, and the pigeon's livers with 
bacon rolled round them should be arranged on the surface. 

I have also found that mutton collops may be used with 
almost as good an effect as those of beef. I used the meat 
of the blade-bone of a shoulder, which was cut into neat 
pieces ; these were rolled with a slice of bacon inside them 
as directed for beef. 

6. " Snipe Pie.'' — When snipes are plentiful, as they 
often are in India, the cook ought to remember this 
delicacy. Supposing eight birds to be available, I would 
work in this way : — I would prepare six of them, as if for 
roasting, for the pie ; and two I would sacrifice for the 
gravy, which ought to be very first rate. For this pur- 
pose two pounds of gravy meat must be obtained, besides 
about a couple of pounds of the undercut, or tender rib- 
meat, for the pie. Having made as good a beef gravy as 
possible, I would throw into it the two snipe, and proceed 
to make a little puree (as explained in Menu No. 16) 
pounding the meat of the birds, after they have been slowly 
simmered in the gravy, to a paste, and blending it with 
the gravy secundum artem. After rubbing the pie-dish 
with a shallot, I would fill up the bottom of it with little 
collops of the tender beef rolled with strips of bacon, 
" spiced pepper" being dusted over each layer until all 
the beef has been used. I would lay the six snipes on the 
surface of the beef with slices of lean bacon, ham, tongue, 
or Bologna sausage, between each bird, garnish as usual, 
baptize the pie with the puree, saving some of it for the 
final process previously described, cover it with a nice 
light paste, and bake. 

Birds badly knocked about in shooting come in usefully 
for gravy. 

Partridges, and quails make good pies, but they require 
a sound and strong support in the way of fresh meat, and 



A FEW NICE PIES. 281 

good gravy. Beef, — the tender undercut, or rib-meat, — 
forms the best basis you can devise : it should be cut up 
into collops, as I have frequently said before, and strips 
of bacon should be rolled round them. Or you can use 
the blade-bone collops of good mutton just described, or 
the neck cutlets ; each cutlet should be trimmed neatly, 
with a strip of bacon wrapped round it. Excellent gravy 
can be obtained from the scraps left after trimming the 
beef or the cutlets, the remnants of the birds not wanted 
in the pie, and a pound of gravy meat, with the usual 
vegetables, and other flavouring ingredients often describ- 
ed. A little wine is almost a sine qua non with these 
game birds : Madeira, sound brown sherry, or any white 
wine — of which a glass is quite enough. 

A good " Game pie'^ is a capital thing for the luncheon, or 
breakfast party. Snipe, quails, partridges, hares, pigeons, 
teal, wild duck, &c., &c., can be thus disposed of most 
advantageously : they must be assisted by tender beef, or 
good mutton collops ; slices of bacon, of ham, or of Bologna 
sausage must be introduced, and the gravy must be very 
attentively composed. A forcemeat made thus will be 
found undeniably valuable : — take the livers of all the 
game composing the pie, and make the composition de- 
scribed elsewhere as "/oie-grras forcemeat," truffles and all, 
using the game livers instead of that of a calf. When 
ready, you can use it as follows : — spread a layer of it over 
the bottom of the pie-dish, and up the sides also : what 
remains should be introduced here and there amongst the 
layers of meat during the packing operations. As the 
game must be honed in the case of this particular dish, we 
shall have to mash all the bones with the pestle, and 
throw them into our stock-pot. Take a pound and a half 
of gravy beef, the mashed game bones, a bacon or ham 
bone, (or a few slices of either) two sheep's feet cut up, 
and the vegetables generally used in soup-making, with a, 



282 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

bouquet of sweet herbs, a clove of garlic, a little mixed 
spice, a dozen pepper corns, a little caramel for colouring, 
and salt to taste, and make the very richest gravy in the 
style of " aspic jelly" stock. Menu No. 9. Instead of 
tarragon vinegar, add to the broth which you get after 
straining, one glass of Madeira, or fruity sherry, a tea- 
spoonful of reduced vinegar, one table-spoonful of red 
currant jelly, and half a wine-glass of mushroom ketchup, 
boil the gravy up again, and then set it to get cool prior 
to its being poured into the pie. The game of which the 
pie is to be made should be carefully honed, and if of a large 
kind, cut up into neat pieces ; skin, scraps, and trimmings 
should be cast into the stock-pot with the mashed bones. 
Arrange the meat when trimmed satisfactorily upon a 
large flat dish, dredge it over with flour, and give it a 
dusting of ^' spiced pepper^* which ought to be specially 
prepared for the occasion. After having rubbed the pie- 
di.sh well with a shallot, spread the thin coating of force- 
meat over the bottom of it, and up the sides, as already 
mentioned. Next, place a good layer of tender beef, or 
m.utton collops, each rolled round a slice of bacon, over 
the forcemeat at the bottom of the dish, and then go on 
packing the game meat, with slices of ham, bacon, or 
Bologna sausage, dotted in here and there, and frequent 
dustings of " spiced pepper" until the dish is filled. 

For a special occasion, a bottle of truffles should be 
opened and used in this way : — Trim the truffles into dice, 
chopping up quite small the parings and trimmings which 
are left : this mince ought to be used in the liver force- 
meat : the dice should be tossed awhile in melted butter 
in a frying-pan, with a glass of Madeira, and a spoonful 
of good gravy and then cleverly put in amongst the game 
meat during the packing of the pie-dish. If mushrooms 
happen to be available as they often are during rainy 
weather, treat them, after cleaning and peeling them, 



A FEW NICE PIES. 283 



exactly like tlie truffles : toss tliem a short time in butter 
in the frjing-pan, if large, cut them into convenient pieces, 
or if buttons, put them in whole as you go on with your 
packing. Thus composed, and bountifully diluted with 
the aforesaid good gravy, our pie may be covered over 
with the best paste, baked, glazed, enriched with a second 
libation of rich gravy poured in through the vent to finish 
with, and served cold with confidence bordering upon 
exultation. 

While on the subject of good pies, I can scarcely do 
better than end this chapter with an excellent recipe for 
a pie, practicable with seer-fish as well as with salmon. 

Salmon pie, to be eaten cold : — Take one pound of salmon 
from the tin, and drain it from the tin liquor. If nice 
and firm, cut it into fillets with a dessert-knife. Make 
three-quarters of a pound of forcemeat as follows : — choose 
either some fresh uncooked whiting, pomfret, or other 
fresh fish and having taken eight ounces of it pass it 
through a wire sieve, add four ounces of fresh butter, and 
four of fine white crumbs, pound all together in a mortar, 
and season the puree with salt and pepper; moisten it 
with a cupful of rich poulette sauce, and bind the mixture 
with two raw eggs. Line a raised pie tin with paste as 
for pork pie, fill the bottom with a layer of the forcemeat, 
then a layer of the salmon, an inch thick, continuing the 
packing till the pie is filled. Put a cover of ptiff-paste 
over the top, brush it over with white of egg, and bake the 
pie slowly. When done, let it cool for half an hour, and 
then pour in, through a hole made in the top, a coffee- 
cupful of rich fish broth, made from the bones and trim- 
mings of the fresh fish, reduced to a glaze, and mix with 
a coffee-cupful of essence of truffles made in this way : — 

Take the contents of a small bottle of truffles, and boil 
them for twenty minutes briskly in a pint of clear chicken 



284 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

broth, flavoured with a glass of Madeira, some sweet herbs, 
pepper, salt, and a little nntmeg. Remove the sauce-pan 
from the fire, and when the liquid is cold, pick out the 
truffles (they will do for any other dish), and strain the 
cold essence. 

After having poured the essence into the pie, let it get 
quite cold, then turn it out of the tin, put it upon a napkin, 
and serve. If made with uncooked seer fish instead of 
salmon, the pie will be found excellent. 

There are, of course, many other pies concerning which 
I could give advice, I am, however, pretty confident that if 
yon bear in mind the principles I have tried to make clear, 
you will rarely fail to succeed in composing a very eatable 
' pasty,' and win approval from those for whose delect- 
ation you may exercise your ingenuity. 

On the Hills, at Bangalore, and at many of the stations 
of this Presidency during the cold months, every one of 
the pies I have described will be found when cold to 
contain firm jelly, — not liquid gravy. If you desire to 
produce that cheerful effect at Madras, do not forget to 
place the pie upon ice for some little time before the meal 
at which it is to appear. The jelly is, of course, the united 
result of good gravy, and the juices of the various meats 
in the pie extracted by baking. 

During the hot weather on the plains, if you cannot ice 
the pie, it will be found a good plan to pour off the gravy- 
after it has left the table, hot. This will prevent the 
meat turning sour. The gravy can be heated the next 
morning, and the pie can be warmed up. Cold pie, with- 
out artificial cold imparted by ice, is an impossibility 
with the thermometer at 90 ° .

Our Curries. 

S^T^ are often told by men of old time, whose long 
connection with the country entitles them to 
speak with the confidence of " fellows who know, 
don't yon know," that in inverse proportion, as it were, to 
the steady advance of civilization in India, the sublime art 
of curry-making has gradually passed away from the native 
cook. Elders at Madras — erst-while the acknowledged 
head-centre of the craft — shake their heads and say " Icha- 
bod !" and if encouraged to do so, paint beautiful mouth- 
watering " pictures in words" of succulent morsels cun- 
ningly dressed with all the savoury spices and condiments 
of Ind, the like of which, they say, we ne'er shall look 
upon again. 

Looking back myself to the hour of my arrival in India, 
I call to mind the kind-hearted veteran who threw his 
doors open to me, and, pouring in the oil and wine of lavish 
hospitality, set me upon his own beast, killed the fatted 
calf, and treated me, indeed, as a son that had been lost and 
was found. It rejoiced this fine old servant of honest John 
Company, I remember, to give " tiffin" parties at which 
he prided himself on sending round eight or nine varieties 
of curries, with divers platters of freshly-made chutneys, 
grilled ham, preserved roes of fishes, &c. The discussion 
of the " course," — a little banquet in itself — used to occupy 

27 



286 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

at least half an hour, for it was the correct thing to taste 
each curry, and to call for those that specially gratified 
you a second time. 

NoTv, this my friend was, I take it, a type of the last 
Anglo-Indian generation ; a genei-ation that fostered the 
art of curry-making, and bestowed as much attention to it 
as we, in these days of grace, do to copying the culinary 
triumphs of the lively Gauls. 

Thirty years ago fair house-keepers were wont to vaunt 
themselves upon their home-made curry powders, their 
chutney s, tamarind and roselle jellies, and so forth, and 
carefully superintended the m-aking thereof. But fashion 
has changed, and although ladies arc, I think, quite as 
fond of a good curry as their grandmothers were, they 
rarely take the trouble to gather round them the elements 
of success, and have ceased to be cumbered about this 
particular branch of their cook's work. 

This is an important point, for if we enquire closely into 
the causes that have led to the alleged decay of the curry- 
making knack, we shall certainly find that the chief of 
them is want of care in the preparation of powders and 
pastes, and the loss of recipes which in days gone by were 
wrapped in silver pajier, and preserved Avith miniatures 
painted on ivory, locks of hair, love sonnets, and other 
precious secrets of a lady's escritoire. 

I say *' chief " advisedly, for there can be no doubt that 
modern improvements in our cuisine, and modern good 
taste, have assisted in a measure in elbowing ofE the once 
delectable plats of Indian origin ; and that the best curry 
in the world would never be permitted to appear at a petit- 
diner composed by a good disciple of the new regime. 

Curries now-a-days are only licensed to be eaten at 
breakfast, at luncheon, and perhaps at the little home 
dinner, when they may, for a change, occasionally form 



OUR CURRIES. 287 



the piece de resistance of that cosy meal. Having tlms 
lost " caste," so to speak, it ought hardly to surprise us 
that curries have deteriorated in quality. The old cooks, 
who studied the art, and were encouraged in its cultiva- 
tion, have passed away to their happy hunting-grounds ; 
and the sons and grandsons who now reign in their stead 
have been taught to devote themselves to more fashionable 
dishes. 



While, however, it cannot be denied that the banish- 
ment of curries from the menu of our high-art banquets, 
both great and small, is, for many reasons, indispensably 
necessary, there can be no doubt that at mess and club 
dinners, at hotels, and at private houses, as already shown, 
these time-honoured dishes will always be welcome. Has 
not the time arrived then for us to endeavour to resuscitate 
the ancient cunning of our cooks, and to take some pains 
to attain that end ? 

The actual cooking of a curry presents no special diffi- 
culty. A cook who is an adept with the stew-pan, and \ 
who has mastered the art of slow, and v ery gentle simmer- I 
^m^ will, whether a Frenchman, an Englishman, or a mild 
Hindu, soon become familiar with the treatment of this 
particular dish. 

The knotty points are these : — First the powder or 
paste, next the accessories, and lastly the order in which 
the various component parts should be added. 

Concerning powders, it behoves us to proceed with cau- 
tion, or we shall soon lose ourselves in a maze of recipes. 
Speaking of them generally, however, it is not, I think, 
commonly known that curry-powders improve by keeping 
it carefully bottled. One of the causes of our daily failures 
is undoubtedly the lazy habit we have adopted of per- 
mitting our cooks to fabricate their " curry-stuff," on the 
spot, as it is required. Powder should be made in large 



I 



288 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

quantities under the eye of the mistress of the house, or 
that of a really trustworthy head-servant. It should then 
be bottled, and corked secui*ely down. 

I shall presently give a very valuable receipt for a stock 
household powder, one that was surrendered to me by an 
accomplished chatelaine, on the eve of her departure from 
India, as a token of the sincerest friendship. But for 
those who wish to avoid trouble and yet to have good 
curries, I strongly advocate the use of Barrie's Madras 
curry-powder and paste. I am not employed as an adver- 
tising medium. My advice is not the advice of a " gent" 
travelling for Messrs. Barrie and Co., it is the honest 
exhortation of one, my friends, who has the success of 
your curries very closely at heart. 

After more than twenty years' experience of Barrie's 
condiments, I say boldly, that I am aware of no prepara- 
tions in the market that can equal them. At the " Orien- 
tal Depot," on the southern side of Leicester Square, — a 
sanctuary known, I fear, to too few Anglo-Indians at 
home — you can see, or coidd see, (for the little place may 
have been swept away for aught I know with Northum- 
berland House, Temple Bar and other structures of re- 
nown), sundry casks of Barrie's curry-stuffs, chutneys, 
&c. I discovered the place by a mere accident, and the 
smell and the order-book convinced me that I had not made 
a mistake. The former was that of my friend Barrie, 
and the latter contained names of such high degree in 
connection with India that I immediately removed my 
hat. 

Unfortunately the depot is largely patronized by Lon- 
don grocers, who, over-wise in their generation, use the 
condiments they purchase as mere stock wherewith to 
flavour some miserable concoction of their own manufac- 
ture. Two parts of arrowroot coloured with saffron, and 
one part of Barrie, for instance, is a mixture that can 



OUR CURRIES. 289 



hardly witli justice be called " genuine Madras curry- 
powder," notwithstanding its being bottled in a very 
pretty bottle, and priced two and six, 

I detected the presence of Barrie's excellent mulliga- 
tunny paste at several places at home, especially at Mutton's 
at Brighton, where a basin of the potage Indien for lunch 
on a frosty day used to be a thing worth recording in a 
pilgrim's diary with red letters. 

Assuming that we have procured, or made, a really 
good stock powder, the accessories next present themselves 
for our consideration. These are very important, for, with 
their aid, a clever cook can diversify the flavour, and style 
of his curries ; without them — be the powder or paste 
never so well composed — the dish will certainly lack finish, 
and the true characteristics of a good curry. 

Prominently among them stands the medium to be used 
for the frying of the onions, with which the process com- 
mences. This most assuredly should be butter. The 
quantity required is not very great, and surely it may be 
assumed that people who want to have a good curry will 
not ruin it for the sake of a " two ounce pat of Dosset !" 
for be it noted, that tinned butter of a good brand is 
admii'ably adapted for this work. 

Among other adjuncts that may be written down as ^ 
indispensable are the ingredients needed to produce that I 
suspicion of sweet-acid which it will be remembered, forms 
a salient feature of a superior curry. The natives of the 
south use a rough tamarind conserve worked, sometimes, 
with a very little jaggery or molasses, and a careful prepa- 
ration of tamarind is decidedly valuable. Why, however, 
should we not improve upon this with red currant jelly 
and if further sharpness be needed, a little lime or lemon 
juice ? In England, and I daresay in India also, chop- 
ped apple is sometimes used, and perhaps chopped mango, 
in the fool-days of the fruit, would be nice. A spoonful 



290 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

of sweetish chutney and a little vinegar or lime juice can 
be employed, but I confess that I prefer the red currant 
jelly as aforesaid. 

There are also certain green leaves which are undoubt- 
edly not to be despised as flavouring agents. By their 
means flavours can be effectively changed. I will speak 
of them again when discussing the process of curry-making 
step by step. 

Xy^i^^ ^ Then there is that most important item the cocoanut. 
This, as everyone knows, is added to a curry in the form 
I of " milk," I.e., an infusion produced by scraping the 
/ white nutty part of the cocoanut, and soaking the scrap- 
^ ings in boiling water. This, strained, is the "milk" 
required in curry-making. The quantity to be used de- 
pends upon the nature of the curry. Malay curries, for 
instance, require a great deal of " milk." The point in 
connection with this adjunct, however, that must not 
be missed, is the period at which it should be added. If 
put in too soon, the value of the nutty juice will be lost, 
— cooked away, and overpowered by the spicy condiments 
with which it is associated. So we must reserve the 
•' milk," as we do cream or the yolk of an g^^ in the case 
of a thick soup or rich sauce, and stir it into our curry the 
last thing ju st before serv ing. 

The strained milk extracted from pounded sweet 
almonds can be put into a curry very advantageously : it 
may be used alone, or be associated with cocoanut milk. 
One ounce of the latter, to twelve almonds, will be found 
a pleasant proportion. When cocoanuts cannot be got, 
almond milk makes a capital substitute. 

Curries cannot afford to dispense with the assistance of 
some stock or gravy. It is not uncommon to hear people 
say that they have eaten far better curries in England 
than in India, the chief reason being that Mary Jane will 



OUR CURRIES. 



291 



not undertake to make the disk without at least a break- 
fast-cupful and a half of good stock. 

Let us now consider attentively the actual details of 
curry-making, and since we cannot proceed to work with- 
out a good powder or paste, we can hardly do better than 
commence operations by studying the recipe for a house- 
hold curry-stuff, concerning which I have already spoken. 
If faithfully followed, it will, I am sure, be found most 
trustworthy. It runs as follows : — 



4 lbs. 


of turmeric ... ... Hind, liuldi. 


8 lbs. 


of coriander-seed ... , 


, dhunnia. 


2 lbs. 


of cummin- seed ... , 


, jeer a. 


1 lb. 


of poppy-seed , 


, Jchush-Jchush. 


2 lbs. 


of fenugreek ... ... , 


, may t hi. 


1 lb. 


of dry-ginger ... ... , 


, S07lt. 


|lb. 


of mustard-seed ... , 


, . rai. 


i lb. 


of dried chillies ... , 


, sooha mirrch. 


1 lb. 


of black pepper corns. , 


, hala mirrch. 



Do not be alarmed at the quantity, remembering my 
previous statement that curry-powder improves by keep- 
ing, if carefully secured. The amount when finally mixed 
will fill about half a dozen bottles of the size in which tart 
fruits are imported. Accordingly, if disinclined to lay in 
so large a stock at a time, the obvious alternative of shar- 
ing some of it with a friend can easily be adopted. 

The lady who gave me the receipt accompanied her 
kind action with a little good advice : — " Weigh every- 
thing," said she, " most carefully, and even after the vari- 
ous ingredients have been cleaned, weigh them again, and 
also weigh the husks, &c., that have been removed. In 
this way alone will you be able to guard against the dis- 
ajDpearance of half an ounce of this, or an ounce of that, — 
petty pilferings that take from the curry-powder that 
which it cannot get again, and leave it poor indeed." 



292 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

Inasmuch, therefore, as short weight can be more easily 
detected in fairly large than in small quantities, an addi- 
tional reason presents itself for making np the entire 
recipe. 

The coriander-seed and fenugreek must each be parched 
very carefully, i.e., roasted like coffee berries, before being 
pounded, and the other ingredients should be cleaned and 
dried, each separately, and, when pounded, should be well 
sifted. 

In order to preserve the proportions after the seeds have 
been powdered and sifted, it is necessary to obtain much 
larger quantities of the various ingredients in the first 
instance. Coriander-seed, for example, is very oily and 
only a part of it will pass through the sieve ; twenty-four 
ounces of the seed will not yield more than eight ounces 
of powder : eight ounces of turmeric root will give four 
of powder : cummin-seed loses about one-third of its origi- 
nal weight in the process of sifting, and dried chilli skin 
about half. 

Weights having been tested, then the whole of the 
powders should be mixed, a quarter of a bottle of salt 
being sprinkled in by degrees during the process. The 
bottles, thoroughly cleansed and dried in the sun, may 
now be filled and corked tightly down, the tops being 
securely waxed over. 

Some recommend that, when the powder has been mixed, 
it should be browned in melted butter over the fire, then 
dried in the sun, and powdered again, in order to tone 
down the strong flavour of the cummin-seed. 

This is a stoclc powder, the flavour of which can be 
varied by the use of certain spices, and green leaves, gar- 
lic, onions, green ginger, almond, cocoanut, &c., at the 
time of cooking the cuiny. 

The spices, which should be used according to taste and 



OUR CURRIES. 293 



discretion, are these : — cloves (laoong), mace (jaivatri), 
cinnamon (kulmi darehini) , initm.eg (jaephal), cardamoms 
{eelachij, and allspice (seetul chini gack), A salt-spoonful 
of one, or at most of two, of these aromatic powders 
blended, will suffice for a . large curry. Dr. Kitchener's 
precept, viz,, that the mixing of several spices is a blunder, 
should never be forgotten. 

The green leaves that are often useful when judiciously- 
introduced are : — fennel (souf), " maytJii hajee" lemon- 
grass (uggea-ghas), bay-leaves (tajipatha) , " Jcaray-paith," 
*^ kotemear' leaves (green coriander), &c. 

When green ginger is used it should be sliced very fine, 
and pounded to a paste ; a dessert-spoonful being suffi- 
cient for one curry. 

The indispensably necessary suspicion of sweet-acid can 
be produced most readily by a dessert-spoonful of powdered 
or moist sugar and the juice of a lime, or a spoonful of 
vinegar. A table- spoonful of sweet chutney and the juice 
of a lime make a good substitute ; but a table-spoonful of 
red currant jelly, with one of chutney, and a little vinegar 
of lime juice, form to my mind the nicest combination for 
dark curries. 

I strongly advocate the very capital plan of making a 
fresh paste of some of the above adjuncts, in sufficient 
quantity for the curry in hand, and blending it with the 
stock powder when cooking the latter. Here is a reliable 
recipe : — One small onion, one clove of garlic, one dessert- 
spoonful of turmeric, one of freshly-roasted coriander-seed, 
one of poppy-seed, a tea-spoonful of Nepaul pepper, one 
of sugar, one of salt, and one of grated green ginger. 
Pound all these with sufficient good salad oil to make a 
paste. Also pound twelve almonds, and one ounce of 
cocoanut, with a little lime juice to assist the operation. 
Then mix the two pastes, and stir into them a salt-spoon- 

28 



294 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

fill of cinnamon or clove-powder. A heaped up tablc- 
spoonfnl of this paste to one of the stock powder will pro- 
duce a very excellent result. Additional heat can be 
obtained by those who like very hot curHes if red chilli 
powder be added to the above ingredients according to 
taste. This paste will keep if put away carefully and 
covered up. 

Having satisfied ourselves as to the composition of oar 
powder and paste, 

We may now work out, step by step, the process to be 
followed in cooking a chicken curry. 

Choose a nice young chicken — and here let me point out 
that large chickens nearly full grown ought never to be 
used in curries — and having cut it up neatly as for a 
fricassee J place the pieces aside, and dredge over them a 
little flour. Next take all the trimmings, neck, pinions, 
leg bones, feet, head, &c., with any scraps of meat that 
can be spared, and cast them into a sauce-pan with an 
onion sliced, a caiTot sliced, half a dozen pepper corns, a 
bit of celery, a pinch of salt and one of sugar, cover them 
with cold water and make the best broth you can. When 
ready, strain the contents of the sauce-pan into a bowl, 
and skim it clean. A good breakfast-cupful of weak stock 
should thus be obtained. Lastly, make a breakfast-cupful 
of milk of cocoanut, or almond. 

Now take your stew-pan, and having sliced up six good 
shallots, or two small white onions, cast the rings into it, 
with two ounces of Denmark, Normandy, or other good 
tinned butter ; add a finely-minced clove of garlic, and 
fry till the onions turn a nice yellow brown. Then add a 
heaped-up table-spoonful of the stock powder, and one of 
the paste, or, if you have not made the latter, two table- 
spoonfuls of the powder. Cook the curry- stuff with the 
onions and butter for a minute or two, slowly, adding by 



OUR CURRIES. 295 



degrees a wine-glassful of the eocoanut milk, and then 
also by degrees the breakfast-ctLpfnl of broth. The effect 
of this when simmered for a quarter of an hour will be a 
rich, thick, cui'ry gravy, or sauce. The stew-pan should 
now be placed en hain-marie while we proceed to prepare 
the chicken. 

Take a frying-pan : melt in it an ounce of butter, or 
clarified beef suet, add a shallot cut up small, and fry for 
a couple of minutes. Next put the pieced of chicken into 
the saute-^2iD., and lightly fry them. As soon as slightly 
coloured, the pieces of chicken should be transferred to 
the stew-pan in which they should rest for at least half an 
hour, marinading, as it were, in the curry gravy. After 
that, the stew-pan should be placed over a gentle fire, and 
if the liquid be found insufficient to cover the pieces of 
chicken, stock, if available, or water, should be added. A 
gentle simmering process should now be encouraged, 
during which the bay-leaf, chutney, and sweet-acid should 
be added. If powder without fresh paste has been used, 
the pounded almond and cocoanut must now be put in, 
with a little spice and grated green ginger. The curry 
gravy should at this period be tasted, and if a little more 
acid or sweet be found necessary, the proper correction 
should be made. As soon as the pieces of chicken have 
become tender, thoroughly stewed, that is to say, a coffee- 
cupful of cocoanut " milk," (the infusion I previously 
mentioned), should be stirred in, and in three minutes the 
operation will be complete. 

If a semi-dry or dry curry be required, the gravy must 
be still further reduced by simmering with the lid off, the 
pieces of meat being continually stirred about with a 
wooden spoon to prevent their catching at the bottom of 
the pan. When the proper amount of absorption has been 
attained, remove the pan and serve. 

Now, those to whom the slipshod method of curry- 



296 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS, 

making, ordinarily followed by native cooks, is familiar, 
will, perhaps, think, that the process I have recommended 
is needlessly tronblesome. The separate frying of the 
chicken, the period of rest in the hain-marie, ^x., may 
seem to them unnecessary. I am, however, perfectly con- 
fident that in order to produce a dish of a superior class, 
we must be prepared to take all this trouble, bringing an 
enlightened system of cookeiy to bear upon the condi- 
ments and ingredients which, so to speak, provide the 
curry flavour. 1 look ujwn a chicken curry as a fricasseey 
or hlanquette d, V Lidienne, and consider that it should cer- 
tainly Ix) treated accoi'ding to the principles of scientific 
cookery. 

The soaking of meat in the liquid curry-stuff is an im- 
portant point, especially when previously cooked meat is 
to be curried. Remember how much better a salmis or a 
hash tastes if the meat of which it is composed has been 
marinaded for an hour or so, before being finally heated 
up, in the carefully-made gravy or sauce composed for it. 

This, I think, accounts for an opinion I once heard 
expressed by a friend of undoubted ability in culinary 
criticism, to the effect that he always found curries of a 
certain kind better when warned up and served as a 
rechauffe than when presented for the first time. If a 
gravy curry be kept during the night in a china curry 
dish, and be resuscitated the next morning with some fresh 
butter, onions and a little gravy, it ought, if anything, to 
be found better than on the previous night, since the meat 
has become thoroughly flavoured by the curry gravy, 
while the latter has become reduced and so strengthened 
by the second simmering. 

These directions will be found practicable with most 
ordinary meat curries. Those made of fresh fish, prawns, 
and shellfish, require a somewhat different process while 



OUR CURRIES, 297 



those of minced cooked meat, tinned or cooked fish, dress- 
ed vegetables, and hard-boiled eggs, merely require to be 
gently heated up in a carefully made curry gravy. 

The Malay or " Ceylon curry" as it is sometimes called, 
is, of course, a spScialite and there are hihdhs, qiioormaS)

Curries— continued, and Mulligatunny. 



tjPjHE outward bound passenger to India is generally 
'hjty very favourably struck by the curry presented to 
him at a Ceylon hostelry. Heartily weary of the 
cuisine on boardship, at that period of his voyage, he 
Avould probably welcome any change w4th thankfulness. 
The prospect of a little meal ashore, " be it ever so hum- 
ble," is therefore especially enjoyable to him. It may, of 
course, be said that in such circumstances the traveller is 
predisposed to deliver a kindly verdict ; and that if the 
dish that pleased him so much in the hour of his eman- 
cipation from cuddy barbarisms were placed before him 
after a proper course of civilized diet, it would, by no 
means produce such an agreeable impression. It would, 
at all events, lack the charm of contrast, which, in the 
particular instance before us, could hardly fail to excite 
the warmest feelings of gratitude and satisfaction. 

The nautical curry is not, as a rule, a plat to dream of, 
— a triumph to look back upon pleasurably, that is to say, 
with the half -closed eye of a connoisseur. A sea-faring 
friend with whom I once made a very cheery voyage, 
graphically described the composition as " yellow Irish 
stew." Those whose memory is retentive of trifles will 
no doubt call to mind without difficulty a bright saffron- 
tinted swill, covering sundry knotty lumps of potato and 



CURRIES— CONTINUED. 299 

a few bony atoms of mutton, with its surface beflecked, 
if I may so describe it, with glossy discs of molten grease. 
Not exactly the sort of dish to tempt a lady, still slightly 
affected by mal-de-vier, who has been urged by her stew- 
ardess to rouse herself, " poor dear," and try and eat 
something. Having had this mess thrust before him day 
after day for three weeks, no wonder that the " vacuus 
viator' finds something in the curry of Ceylon to delight 
him. 

" Good ! said I to myself, cheered at the sight" (a 
plump, freshly-roasted leveret), wrote Brillat Savarin con- 
cerning his experiences of a journey ; "I am not entirely 
abandoned by Providence : a traveller may gather a floiver 
hy the iv ay -side.'" 

Regarding the Ceylon curry, then, as a " flower by the 
way-side," let us proceed to consider its composition v/ith 
all due attention. As I observed in my last chapter, the 
dish is quite a specialite, peculiar originally to places where 
the cocoanut is extensively grown and appreciated. It is 
known by some as the " Malay curry," and it is closely 
allied to the onoli of the Tamils of Southern India. 
Though best adapted for the treatment of shell-fish, ordi- 
nary fish, and vegetables of the cucumis or gourd family, 
it may be advantageously tried with chicken, or any nice 
white meat. We can describe it as a species of fricassee, 
rich with the nutty juice of the cocoanut, and very deli- 
cately flavoured with certain mild condiments. It ought 
to be by no means peppery or hot, though thin strips of 
red and green chilli-skin or capsicum may be associated 
with it. It therefore possesses characteristics very differ- 
ent from those of an ordinary curry. The knotty point is 
the treatment and application of the cocoanut, which 
should be as fresh and juicy as possible, and of which 
there should be no stint. 

In places where cocoanuts cannot be readily procured. 



300 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

a very good " mock" Ceylon curry can be made with the 
milk of almonds, and from Brazil nuts an infusion can be 
concocted that very much resembles cocoanut milk. 

The condiments employed are onions, a very little garlic, 
green ginger, turmeric powder, a little powdered cinna- 
mon and cloves, and the chilli strips aforesaid. Coriander- 
seed, cummin-seed, cardomoms, fenugi'eek, chilli-powder, 
poppy-seed, &c., ought, on no account, to be used. 

The most agreeable combinations are prawns with cu- 
cumber, crab with vegetable marrow, or any firm-fleshed 
fish or tender chicken witli either of those vegetables. 
For example, I will select a prawn and cucumber curry : — 

(a) — Take a good-sized cucumber, or two small ones, 
cut them lengthwise into quarters, remove the seeds, and 
peel off the g^ee^ skin. Cut them into pieces two inches 
long and one inch thick, and put them into a stew-pan 
with plenty of water, half an ounce of butter, and a tea- 
spoonful of salt. Simmer them until three pai'ts done; 
then drain the liquid off, and turn the pieces of cucumber 
out upon a clean dish, and cover them up. 

(h) — The prawns should be prepared very carefully ; 
and here permit me to observe that if prawns are fresh, 
and properly cleaned, no evil effects need be dreaded by 
those who look upon them as dangerous. Throw two 
table-spoonfuls of salt into a gallon of water, put the pan 
on the fire, and when the water boils fast, slip into it 
about a pound and a half of prawns weighed in their 
shells. Boil, and as soon as the prawns turn a rosy pink, 
stop, drain them from the water, let them get cold, and 
shell them, removing their heads completely. Next pass 
a knife down the line of the back of each prawn, slightly 
open the groove as it were, and pick out of it the black 
gritty dirt that you will find there. CaiTy out a similar 
process with the inner line, and cast the cleaned prawns 



CURRIES— CONTINUED. 301 

into a basin of spring water. Having washed them again 
thoroughly, pick them out, and dry them on a cloth. If 
very large, you must now divide them in halves length- 
wise, and sever each half in twain. Dust them over with 
flour, and put them on a dish. They are now ready. 

(c) — Choose a very large cocoanut, the fresher the better, 
break it in half, and, with a cocoanut scraper, remove the 
whole of the white flesh, casting it into a bowl. Upon the 
raspings thus obtained, pour a breakfast-cupful of boiling 
water, leave it for a quarter of an hour, and then strain 
the liquid off. This is the best or " number 07ie' infusion, 
which must be put away, and not added to the curry till 
the last thing before serving. Return the raspings to 
their bowl, and pour over them a pint and a half of boiling 
water, stir well, and let the liquid stand for half an hour. 
It should then be strained, and the nutty atoms squeezed 
dry in muslin, so that every drop of the cocoanut essence 
may be secured. The liquor thus obtained is the " mim- 
her two'' infusion. Our preparations are now complete. 

{d) — Put two ounces of good tinned butter into a stew- 
pan, and mix into it, as it melts over a brisk fire, a white 
Bombay onion shi^ed into rings, and a clove of garlic finely 
minced. Lightly fry, but do not allow the onions to 
turn colour before adding a table-spoonful of good 
flour, a dessert-spoonful of turmeric powder, a tea- spoon- 
ful of salt, and a scant one of sugar, a tea-spoonful of 
mixed cloves and cinnamon powder, and, by degrees, the 
" number two infusion." A breakfast-cupful of thick 
chicken broth, or fish consomme — made by simmering some 
fish bones, prawn shells, and scraps of fish, in water, with 
an onion, a carrot, and some parsley — may now go in to 
assist the composition, together with a heaped-up table- 
spoonful of sliced green ginger, and three green chillies 
cut into Julienne-like strips. The liquid is now ready for 
the prawns, so remove the stew-pan from the fire, and 

29 



S02 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS, 

place it in a bath of boiling water, to keep warm, while 
you add the prawns and the slices of partly-cooked cucum- 
ber. It will be found an excellent plan to permit the 
curry — now all but ready — to rest for about half an hour, 
at the expiration of which the pan may be placed over a 
moderate fire, and its contents brought to simmering point. 
When satisfied that both the prawTis and vegetable are 
tender, the " number one" infusion may be stirred in, and 
with it a tea-spoonful of lime-juice. Five minutes' sim- 
mering will now complete our task, and the curry can 
be dished up, and served. 

It should be noted carefully that the water found inside 
a cocoanut is not " cocoanut milk" accoi*ding to the culi- 
nary vocabulary. The infusion is what should be used in 
curry-making. 

Fillets of any firm-fleshed fish, or even neat fillets of 
chicken, may be treated precisely in the manner I have 
described. As, however, it is necessary partly to cook 
prawns, crabs, lobsters, shrimps, &c., separately, a longer 
process of simmering will be necessary for raw fillets. 
The pieces of chicken should be lightly tossed in butter in 
a sait^t'-pan with a finely-shred onion, before being put into 
the curry sauce. 

The MOLi is prepared in this manner : — Melt a couple of 
ounces of butter, and fry therein an onion sliced into rings, 
and a clove of garlic minced, a few stHps of green chilli, 
and some slices of green ginger ; stir into it a table-spoon- 
ful of flour, and add by degrees the " number two infusion" 
just alluded to. Work this to the consistency of a rich 
white sauce adding a little broth if necessary, heat up 
some slices of cooked fish or chicken in it, and finish off, 
as already described, with " number one infusion," and a 
tea-spoonful of lime-juice. A little turmeric powder may 
be used if the yellow colour be considered desirable. If 
raw fish be used, the simmering process will be necessarv 



CURRIES— CONTINUED. 303 

Old Indian cookery books give a number of recipes for 
KTJBAB curries, for tbe most part of purely native design, 
and requiring condiments and ingredients whicli were per- 
haps appreciated by our forefathers who adopted an almost 
Oriental method of life. The best hubab, to my mind, us 
one made of tender mutton or veal, and treated as fol- 
lows '. — 

Cut the mutton into thickish pieces, about an inch 
square and half an inch thick ; cut out of some slices of 
good bacon some pieces an inch square also, but about a 
quarter the thickness of the mutton ; cut up some pieces 
of parboiled white onion upon the same pattern as the 
bacon, and some thin slices of green ginger to match. 
Impale these mixed pieces upon small plated or silver 
skewers, or upon thinly-cut wooden ones, maintaining the 
order I have given, viz., jBrst a piece of mutton, then a piece 
of bacon, then a bit of onion, and lastly, the thin slice of 
green ginger. Having repeated this until the skewer is 
filled, go on with another. When all have been completed, 
the huhdhs should be simmered in a good curry sauce as 
recommended for chicken curry. Before being added to 
the sauce, however, they should be lightly tossed in butter 
in a saute-ip2in with an onion sliced, a tea-spoonful of salt, 
and one of sugar. The introduction of the slice of bacon 
is a very great improvement. 

The " QUOOKMA," if well made, is undoubtedly an excel- 
lent curry. It used, I believe, to be one of the best at the 
Madras Club, in days when curries commanded closer 
attention than they do now. 

Cut up about a pound of very tender mutton without 
any bone, and stir the pieces about in a big bowl with a 
dessert- spoonful of pounded green ginger, and a sprinkling 
of salt. Melt a quarter of a pound of butter in a stew- 
pan, and throw into it a couple of white ^onions cut int® 



304 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

rings, and a couple of cloves of garlic finely minced. Fry 
for about five minutes, and then add a tea-spoonful of 
pounded coriander-seed, one of pounded black pepper, half 
one of pounded cardomoms, and half one of pounded cloves. 
Cook this for five minutes, then put in the meat, and stir 
over a moderate fire until the pieces seem tender, and have 
browned nicely. Now, take the pan from the fii*e, and 
work into it a strong infusion obtained from four ounces 
of well-pounded almonds, and a breakfast-cupful of cream. 
Mix thoroughly, adding a dessert-spoonful of turmeric 
powder, and a tea-spoonful of sugar. Put the pan over a 
very low fire, and let the curry simmer as gently as possi- 
ble for a quarter of an hour, finishing o£E with the juice of 
a couple of limes. This, it will be perceived, is another 
curry of a rich yet mild description. The total absence 
of chilli, indeed, constitutes, in the opinion of many, its 
chief attraction. 

According to the ancient canons by which the service 
of curries was regulated, chutneys of various kinds were 
considered as essentially necessary as the lordly platter of 
rice which, of course, accompanied them. These may bo 
divided into two distinct classes : the preserved or bottled 
chutneys, and those that are made of fresh materials on 
the spot. Of the former I need say nothing : they arc 
easily procured, and most people know the kind that suits 
them best. But concerning the latter, I think a little 
reflection will be found advantageous. There can be no 
doubt that the presentation of these chutneys, — the little 
liors d'oeuvres, so to speak, of the curry service, — has of 
late years passed quietly into desuetude. This has been 
the result, to be sure, of the disappearance of cuiTies from 
the memi of the modern dinner, and the very moderate 
degree of attention that they now command at our hands. 
Assuming, however, that those who still occasionally 
patronize the dish would rather see it at its best, and 



CURRIES— CONTINUED. 305 

served correctly than not, I will go on with a few recipes 
that will be found easy enough. 

Fresh chutneys should be served in saucers which should 
be tastefully arranged upon a tray. Four or five varieties 
can be presented together, so that there may be an oppor- 
tunity of selection. 

Caviare dressed with a few drops of lime juice and a 
dust of yellow pepper ; roes of fish pounded with a little 
butter J potted prawns ; potted ham ; crab paste ; lobster 
paste ; and sardine paste, are Jiors d'oeuvres that can accom- 
pany the chutneys and materially assist them. 

The best fresh chutneys are : tomato, cucumber, mint, 
brinjal, cocoanut, mango or apple, tamarind, and potato. 

For tomato chutney : — Remove the seeds and watery 
juice from two or three ripe tomatoes, chop them up with 
a quarter their bulk of white onion, and season the mince 
with a little salt ; add a pinch of salt, two green chillies 
chopped small, and a little bit of celery also chopped, give 
the whole a dust of black pepper, and moisten it with a 
tea-spoonful of vinegar — anchovy vinegar for choice. 

For cucumber cliutney : — Cut the cucumber into thin 
strips an inch long ; say three heaped up table-spoonfuls ; 
mix with them a tea-spoonful of finely-minced onion, one 
of chopped gTeen chilli, and one of parsley ; moisten with 
a dessert-spoonful of vinegar in which a pinch of sugar 
has been dissolved, a dessert-spoonful of salad oil, and 
dust over it salt and black pepper at discretion. 

Brinjal cJiiitney is made in this manner : — Boil two or 
three brinjals, let them get cold, scrape out the whole of 
the inside of the pods, pass this through the sieve to get 
rid of the seeds. Rub a soup-plate with a clove of garlic, 
empty the brinjal pulp therein, dress it with a tea- spoon- 
ful of minced onion, one of green chilli, one of vinegar, 



306 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

and a very little green ginger, season with salt and black 
pepper, pat the mixtni'e into a little mould, and serve in a 
saucer. 

Cocoanut chutyiey consists of pounded cocoanut, flavoured 
with minced onion and green chilli, green ginger, and an 
atom of garlic, moistened with tamarind juice, and season- 
ed with red pepper and salt. 

Mint chutney is made in the same way, substituting 
pounded mint for cocoanut. Scald the mint leaves before 
pounding them. 

Mango or apple chutney is made like cucumber chutney 
with the addition of a tea-spoonful of chopped green ginger. 

Tamarind chutney is a good one : — Pound together a 
table-spoonful of tamarind pulp and one of green ginger, 
season it with salt, a tea-spoonful of minced green chillies, 
and one of mustard seed roasted in butter ; mix thorough- 
ly and serve. 

Mashed potato chutney is flavoured witli minced onion, 
green chilli, salt, pepper, vinegar, and a pinch of sugar. 
With tfiese relishes, curries are undoubtedly far nicer 
than when sent up unassisted. 

Treacher's tinned Bombay duclcs when presented with 
curries only require crisping in a brisk oven. 

Papodums may either be toasted on a griddle over some 
clear embers, or fried in hot fat. Thin slices of raw 
brinjal, and green plantains, similarly fried, like potato 
chips, are nice with curries. 

Mulligatunny. 

If it be admitted that the knack of curry-making has 
gradually passed away from the native cook, I think it 
must also be allowed that a really well-made mulligatunny 
is, comparatively speaking, a thing of the past. Perhaps, 



MULLIGATUNNY. 307 



then, a few words regarding this really excellent, and at 
times, most invigorating soup may be acceptable. In 
attempting this, I am anxious to address my observations 
to vegetarians, as well as to those who have no objection 
to eat meat, for I hope to be able to show that a very ex- 
cellent mulligatunny can be made without any assistance 
from flesh or fowl. 

This preparation, originally peculiar to Southern India, 
derives its name from two Tamil words — molegoo (pepper), 
and tunnee (water). In its simple form, as partaken of 
by the poorer natives of Madras, it is, as its name indi- 
cates, a " pepper-water" or soupe maigre, which Mootoo- 
samy makes as follows : — He pounds together a dessert- 
spoonful of tamarind, six red chillies, six cloves of garlic, 
a tea-spoonful of mustard seed, a salt-spoonful of fenugreek 
seed, twelve black peppercorns, a tea-spoonful of salt, and 
six leaves of haray-jpauh. When worked to a paste, he 
adds a pint of water, and boils the mixture for a quarter 
of an hour. While this is going on, he cuts up two small 
onions, puts them into a chatty, and fries them in a des- 
sert-spoonful of ghee till they begin to turn brown, when 
he strains the pepper- water into the chatty, and cooks the 
mixture for five minutes, after which it is ready. The 
pepper-water is, of course, eaten with a large quantity of 
boiled rice, and is a meal in itself. The English, taking 
their ideas from this simple composition, added other 
condiments, with chicken, mutton, &c., thickened the 
liquid with flour and butter, and by degrees succeeded in 
concocting a soupe grasse of a decidedly acceptable kind. 

Oddly enough, we undoubtedly get the best mulliga- 
tunny now-a-days in England, where it is presented in the 
form of a clear, as well as in that of a thick, soup. In an 
artistic point of view, the former is infinitely the better of 
the two, as I shall endeavour to explain later on. N'ever- 
theless, the thick is by no means to be despised. The 



308 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

superiority of the English adaptation needs bnt little 
explanation, for it may safely be attributed to the fact that 
the soup is composed upon a really strong foundation in 
the shape of stock, an important point that most Indian 
cooks slur over. 

This reminds me of an anecdote, which an old friend 
and fellow-enthusiast on the subject of cookery, communi- 
cated to me as follows : — He was at home on furlough, and 
happened to visit an old uncle, whose early years had been 
spent in the Navy. The Admiral (for the old gentleman 
had attained that rank) was of a somewhat dictatorial 
nature, and had acquired a habit of asserting his opinions 
with a closed fist and vehement superlatives. Conversa- 
tion one day turned upon mulligatunny, and the ancient 
mariner declared vociferously that he had never tasted 
the soup properly made since serving in the West Indies 
in the Fenelopc frigate in the year 1823, angi'ily shutting 
up his nephew for daring to observe that it could be fairly 
well prepared in the East. Now, my friend was far too 
wise in his generation to contradict his uncle, " but," said 
he, " I determined to circumvent him." Accordingly 
Avhen, after some little time, the Admiral went up to 
London, he was lured into an ambuscade at his nephew's 
house. " I made the imdligatiuiny myself," said my friend, 
" the basis of which Avas a good veal stock, prepared, of 
course, the previous day. My method of procedure was 
as follows : — I cut up a large sweet onion into fine rings, 
and fried them in two ounces of good butter, till about to 
turn yellow. I then stirred in three table-spoonfuls of 
Barrie's Madras mulligaUmny paste, adding sufficient stock 
to bring tlie mixture to the consistency of mayonnaise 
sauce. This I tasted, and, finding that it required a little 
sub-acid, I administered a table-spoonful of red currant 
jelly and a few drops of lemon juice. Having stirred this 
in well, I put in a dessert-spoonful of Madras chutney, and 



MULLIGATUNNY. 309 



added stock enough to produce a thin soup — about three 
pints in all. This I allowed to simmer (to extract the 
flavours of the various ingredients) for a quarter of an 
hour, while I pounded four ounces of sweet almonds in a 
mortar with a little milk, using a breakfast-cupful al- 
together. When fully pounded, I strained the almond 
milk into the soup, and stopped the simmering. The next 
step was to pass the whole of the liquid through a tin 
strainer into a clean bowl to catch up lumps of onion, 
chutney, &c. The mulligatunny having been skimmed, 
was now ready, all but the thickening. This process was 
carried out in due course, with two ounces of butter and 
two of flour. The soup was brought to boiling-point, and, 
off the fire, just before serving, a coffee-cupful of the best 
cream I could get was stirred into the tureen as the soup 
was poured into it." "When this was presented to the 
Admiral, the old gentleman was delighted, and, altogether 
forgetting his previous asseveration, exclaimed that he had 
not eaten such a basin of mulligatunny since serving on 
the East India station in the CocJcatrice in the year 1834. 
" I knew," concluded by friend, " that the dear old man 
was thinking of ' calipash' and ' calipee' when he pitched 
into me on the previous occasion, but I was not such an 
ass as to suggest that he had made a mistake." 

This recipe of my friend's may be taken as a very good 
guide for a mulligatunny made with pure meat stock 
extracted from veal, mutton, beef, or fowl, and ready-made 
paste. Yolks of eggs may supply the place of cream, and 
cocoanut milk may be substituted for the lait d'amandes. 
The addition of either almond or cocoanut milk is, how- 
ever, a sine qua non, if the object be to obtain a soft, 
creamy, well-flavoured, thick mulligatunny . The strain- 
ing must also be carried out carefully, and the thickening 
as well. 

Rice is served with mulligatunny, but it is, I think, a 

30 



I 



810 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 



mistake to do so. We do not call for rice with hare soup, 
game soup, or mock-tui'tle ; why, then, should we ruin our 
appetites by taking rice with so satisfying a yotage as 
mull iga tunny ? The custom has been handed down to us 
by our forefathers, who, of course, ate rice with their 
mulligatuHJiy, as did the natives from Avliom they learnt 
the dish. 

The object in a clear mnlligatiinny is to present a bright, 
sparkling consomme of the colour of clear turtle, with a 
decided flavour of imdligatnnny, and slightly peppery. 
Now, if you try to communicate the flavour with ready- 
made curry-powder or paste, in which there is a certain 
quantity of turmeric, you will experience considerable 
difficulty in getting your soup bright and clear. Pounded 
coriander seed, too, is oily, and would probably cause 
trouble. So the easiest method is to put a muslin bag, 
containing the flavouring ingredients, into the soup kettle 
with tlic vegetables, and to remove it as soon as the C07i- 
somme is satisfactorily impregnated with the wished-for 
aroma. The pepperiness is best imparted with a few drops 
of tabasco as a finishing touch, or of chilli-vinegar if 
tabasco be unobtainable. 

The following proportions will, I think, be found satis- 
factory as far as the flavouring is concerned : — Two ounces 
of coriander seed, one ounce of cummin seed, one ounce of 
fenugi'eek or maythee, half an ounce of mustard seed, two 
cloves of garlic, a dozen black peppercorns, and four or 
five leaves of hurreapliool, or Izodia neem (karay-pauk). 
All put into a muslin bag, without pounding or bruising, 
boiled with the soup, and removed as soon as the flavour 
is satisfactory. These quantities are estimated for above 
three pints of clear consomme ; but as tastes vary in the 
matter of condiments, they are obviously susceptible of 
alteration at discretion. 

I would abstain from the use of all ordinary spices for 



MULLIGATUNNY. 311 

fear of disturbing the flavour derived from the currj-stuff. 
The soup itself may be ordinary consomme, consomme de 
volaille or blond de veau. Clear ox-tail thus flavoured is 
well-known at the Army and Navy Club in London under 
the name of q^ueue de hceuf a VIndienne. 

Fish consomme, i.e., a stock made from fish and vege- 
tables, makes a capital basis for a thick mulUgatunny ; 
and a bisque or puree of shell-fish, flavoured with curry- 
paste, is a right royal potage. 

Vegetarians can fall back upon a stock composed of 
vegetables, consomme de legumes. This, artfully flavoiu'ed 
with a good mulUgatunny paste, thickened with flour and 
butter, and enriched with lait d'amandes, cocoanut milk, 
cream, or raw yolks of eggs, w411 be found to make a most 
excellent soupe maigre. 

The stock should be composed as follows : — Weigh, when 
trimmed and cut up, one pound, each, of carrots and 
onions. Throw them into a stew-pan, with half a pound 
of butter (tinned butter will do well), a bunch of parsley, 
and a couple of ounces of celery. Fry until the vegetables 
begin to take colour, then moisten with two quarts of hot 
water. Boil and skim, then put into the pan half an 
ounce of salt, a quarter ounce of black peppercorns, and a 
pint measure of shelled green peas. Simmer for three 
hours, skim off any oil that may rise from the butter, and 
strain the broth into a basin through a tamis. 

Be careful in using turnips. Unless they are very 
young they are apt to be overstrongly flavoured in this 
country. Leeks are invaluable ; if available I would put 
half a pound of them in with the carrots ; a few sprigs of 
thyme or marjoram are also useful. A pint of French 
beans may be used instead of, or in addition to, the peas. 
This consomme is, with a dash of white wine, quite fit to 
serve alone. Maccaroni or vermicelli may be added to it 
as a garnish, and grated Parmesan may accompany it. 



312 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

For ordinary mulligatunni) maigre, however, plain eau 
de cuisson may be employed. This most useful liquid is 
too often thrown away by ignorant native cooks, or an- 
nexed by the wary ones for theii' own food. It is the 
water in which certain vegetables have been boiled. As 
a matter of economy, house-keepers should make a note of 
this. Suppose you want to make a salade cuite, i.e., a 
salad of cooked vegetables, the water in which the carrots, 
onions, leeks, peas, flageolets, French beans, and young 
turnips are boiled will provide you with an excellent stock 
for ordinary white sauce, or imdligaianny. 

The ordinary chicken or mutton imdligatunny, made 
without assistance in the way of stock, may, with some 
little pains, be sent up in better style than our cooks, as a 
rule, are satisfied with. We do not want a thin yellow 
liquid with queer-looking leaves and bits of fried onion 
floating in it. "We ask for a smooth, creamy jjo/a^e, free 
from any lump or floating substance, and garnished with 
a few choice pieces of the chicken or mutton of which it 
was composed. 

Cut up a well-nurtured chicken or young fowl as if for 
fricassee, soak the pieces in cold water for a quarter of an 
hour, then slice up a couple of good-sized onions, and put 
them, with two table-spoonfuls of butter, into a stew-pan 
on a good fire. Fry the chicken and onions together till 
slightly browned, then pick out the chicken, and stir into 
the butter a couple of table-spoonfuls of mulligahmny 
paste or curry-powder (Barrie's "Madras," if possible). 
Cook the paste or powder with the butter and onions for 
five minutes, and then stir in a couple of pints of warm 
water. Add the chicken ; and if the pieces are not quite 
covered, put in water enough to do so. Let the contents 
come to the boil, then ease off the fire, and simmer for half 
an hour very gently. While this is going on, pound a 
couple of ounces of almonds in a mortar, with a coffee- 






MULLIGATUNNY. 313 

cupful of milk, give it a pinch of sugar, and let the mix- 
ture stand till wanted. Now, having ascertained that the 
chicken is quite tender, stir in a dessert-spoonful of good 
chutney, a tea-spoonful of red currant jellv, and a tea- 
spoonful of lime-juice, and, after five minutes' simmering, 
strain off the whole of the liquid into a bowl. Pick out 
the nicest pieces of chicken for garnish, and put them 
aside. Now, skim the surface of the liquid, and, when 
quite clear of grease, proceed to thicken it, using a table- 
spoonful of butter and one of flour, and stirring in the soup 
slowly. All having been poui^ed in, strain into the sauce- 
pan the almond milk, using a piece of muslin in order to 
catch up the bits of nut. Let the mulligatunny come to 
the boil, and serve. 

The chief points to observe are : — First, the use of a 
really good paste or powder ; next the simmering and ad- 
dition of a pleasant sub-acid ; then the straining, skim- 
ming, and thickening ; and lastly, the introduction of the 
almond milk. Instead of almond milk, cocoanut milk (the 
infusion of the nut, I mean) may be used, and a table- 
spoonful of cream, or a couple of raw yolks of eggs, may be 
stirred into the tureen with the soup, by degrees, just 
before serving. The choice pieces of chicken should also 
be served in the mulligatunny . 

For mutton mulligatunny follow this recipe, substitut- 
ing a neck or breast of mutton for the chicken. 

It will be seen from these observations that, while there 
is no difficulty whatever in making mulligatunny of a 
superior, as well as of an ordinary kind, it is a soup that 
demands no little care and attention. Whether it is worth 
the trouble or not is a question that can only be decided 
by practical experiment. I have no hesitation in recom- 
mending the trial.

Camp Cookery. 

wA% LTHOUGH no doubt there arc many of my readers 
:xTV ^^'^^ have by long experience acquired the knack 
^^ of making themselves thoroughl}' comfortable 
under canvas, and who, being fond of nice food, and an 
fait in culinary science, contrive to eat and drink in camp 
as luxuriously as in cantonment, there must be, I take it, 
a good many travellers, sportsmen, soldiers, and others 
whose duties demand several months of tent-life ^er annum^ 
who would like to pick up a wrinkle or two in the matter 
of cookery under difficulties. 

A friend of mine, who in addition to his passionate 
devotion to Ja chasse, possesses the keenest affection for 
his dinner, assured me, once upon a time, that good bread 
was the back-bone of happiness, — gustatory happiness, 
that is to say, — in the jungle. In cantonment even, this 
man despised the miserable travesty called bread furnished 
by the native baker. They say that he once saiv it heing 
made, never thought of it again without a shudder, and 
preferred a home-made roll for ever afterwards. He car- 
ried his roll with him, so to speak, into camjD, and with 
the aid of a talented servant, was able to bake hot, clean, 
white bread daily, at a distance of many marches from an 
English dwelling place. He used Yeatman's baking 
powder, imported Australian or American flour, and a

little salt. Butter and milk were aclcled in the case of his 
fancy petit loain, and he occasionally mixed oatmeal with 
the flour for variety. 

I often envied my friend's bread, yet never took the 
trouble to follow his example until comparatively lately. 
My conversion was brought about by Mr. Woolf of 119, 
New Bond Street, who introduced me to the " Acme cook- 
ing stove,"* and gave me many a seance with regard to 
the use of Yeatman's baking powder for which his firm 
are the London Agents. The man who could remain un- 
convinced after one of Mr. Woolf 's pleasant demonstrations, 
would be a stoic indeed. You are shown how to make a 
pound loaf, — " cottage" pattern, in rolls, or in the tin. 
This is placed in the stove oven whilst you examine the 
numerous clever contrivances for the kitchen, — jorincipally 
American inventions, — which form the specialites of the 
establishment. In less than half an hour the loaf, baked 
to perfection, is placed upon the table. 

!N'ow here are two invaluable articles for the dweller in 
tents : — a composition, perfectly climate-proof, by which 
he can turn out an excellent loaf of light, clean bread ; 
and the oven to bake it in. 

The " Acme Stove" is cheap, portable, strong, and easily 
managed. It is fed by mineral oil, kerosine or parafine, 
and in addition to the oven, provides the cook with a 
capital kitchen range adapted for boiling, stewing, frying, 
and even grilling. The size I recommend, after upwards 
of two years' experience of its working, — more than a year 
of that time having been spent at Madras, — is fitted with 
double wicks four inches wide. One of these stoves with 
its ordinary appurtenances can be purchased for £2, 5.15. 
For that sum you have a capital oven, with baking dishes 

* Now eclipsed by the " Florence" which is worked exactly like the 
Acm6" but with numerous improvements. — W. 



316 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

and a griddle, a radiator, a kettle, and a frying-pan. 
Ordinary sauce-pans of a certain diameter can be used 
with it. A Warren's cooking pot, fitted to the stove, is 
furnished for £1-1, and a griller for five shillings and 
sixpence. "When not wanted for cooking, it can bo used 
for heating a room, for which purpose, you use the radiator, 
or ornamental chimney, previously mentioned. Thus 
adjusted, it is also very useful for airing damp linen, or 
drying wet clothes ; you have merely to place a largo 
circular basket over it, and spread the things thereon, for 
the chimney is so contrived that the heat radiates laterally, 
and there is therefore no chance of burning, scorching, or 
smoking. 

In camp, the first thing the Acme would do for you 
would be to boil the water for your tea : if a raw 
December, or January morning in the Deccan, or on the 
plateau of Mysore, you would not object to the operation 
being performed inside your tent, for the warmth would 
be very pleasant. It would then bake the bread for your 
breakfast, and warm up any rechauffe destined for that 
meal at the same time. During the day it would make 
the soup, and in the evening be available for work for 
dinner. I do not say that you could do without a charcoal 
fire, but the stove would do a large portion of the day's 
cooking, and in a way vastly superior to any ordinary fire, 
either in camp or cantonment. In soup-making, for 
instance, and in stewing operations, you possess the power 
of producing the exact amount of heat you need by turning 
down the wicks at will. I have made a pot-au-feu, in a 
Warren's kettle placed upon my Acme, the like of w^hich 
I defy a native cook to produce with a common cook-room 
fire, simply on account of this regulating power. A gallon 
flask of kerosine oil should be made to fit the stove box 
for short periods of camp life. If a man were settled in a 
standing camp, or out in his district for an indefinite 



CAMP COOKERY. 317 



period, he would, of course, require a keg of oil. I use my 
stove for some houi's daily, and my month's expenditure 
does not exceed ten quart bottles. 

Another of Mr. Woolf's valuable inventions, which I 
can strongly advise the traveller to obtain, is the " Lang 
spirit lamp" : the large one costs five shillings and six- 
pence, and is a never failing source of comfort on a 
journey. In camp it would be found a most useful 
appendage to the Acme stove for light work, such as boil- 
ing milk for coffee, cooking eggs in all sorts of ways, heat- 
ing sauces, frying bacon, &c. I use mine for omelettes 
almost every day in cantonment, for which work it is 
admirably adapted. With a " Lang lamp" you can make 
a cup of tea or coffee in the train, by the side of the road, 
on arrival at a public bungalow, or under a tree whilst the 
lascars are pitching your tent : and by its aid, and that of 
a small frying-pan, you can devil a biscuit, fry a rasher, 
poach an egg, or cook a kidney, to accompany the tea or 
coffee. It is fed by methylated spirit, a gallon of which 
would last for at least two months. 

Having thus directed your attention to two excellent 
appliances for the camp kitchen,* I will return to the sub- 
ject of baking bread, for your servants can always contrive 
a field oven for you without difficulty, which, though 
infinitely inferior to that of the stove, will perform the 
task required of it fairly enough. But in wet weather, 
the owner of an Acme will, of course, laugh and grow fat, 
whilst his neighbour with only Ramasamy's fine whether 
make-shift to fall back upon, will beg for bread. 

I have baked at home regularly now for over two years 
using, for ordinary bread, Yeatman's baking powder, 

* There are, I dare say, cooking stoves, fed by minex^al oils, 
patented by other firms, which are similar to the Acme in working 
and quite as good. I have confined my remarks to the one which 
I have thoroughly tested.

American flour, salt, and water ; for fancy rolls, tlie same 
with butter, and milk ; and have discovered^ after many 
experiments, that in this country, the proportions of 
baking powder to flour which are laid down in the paper 
of directions accompanying each tin, have to be increased. 
For eight ounces of flour, for instance, I find that I have 
to use two tea-spoonfuls of Yeatmau. 

I may say without hesitation that very few bread- 
makers hit off perfection at starting. I struggled through 
many disheartening attempts, before I turned out the thing 
I wanted. The common mistakes are overworking the 
dough, and using too much liquid. The mixing of dough 
^ith the proper quantity of fluid can only be acquired by 
practice, and all beginners knead too heavily through over 
zeal. Watch a professor. The fair-haired artiste who 
demonstrates bread-making at Mr. Woolf 's, makes a pound 
loaf with three-quarters of a tea-cupful of water; her 
touch is as light as a feather, and the dough is made with 
wonderful swiftness. I have taught my servant to use 
two wooden spoons to work his dough with, the result is 
satisfactory as regards the lightness of the bread, and to 
those who dislike eating food mauled by native fingers, 
the system is especially attractive. If by any chance 
your dough has been made too sloppily, and from its 
putty-like consistency, you feel convinced it will be heavy, 
bake it in a tin. 

The pai^phernalia of the home-baker should be : — a 
large enamelled iron milk basin, two wooden spoons, a flour 
dredger, scales to weigh the flour, some patty-pans for 
rolls, some small tins for ditto, a baking-sheet, a half 
pound and pound loaf tin, and a cake tin : these various 
things are not expensive, they should be kept in the house 
(when in cantonment) away from the cook-room, as clean 
as possible, and be scrupulously reserved for their own 
purposes. Having provided yourself with this equipment, 



CAMP COOKERY. 319 



yon should use Yeatman's baking powder, the best import- 
ed flour you can get, oatmeal occasionally, salt, and either 
good butter made at home, or that of any well-known 
brand preserved in tin. Here is a reliable receipt for four 
nice breakfast or dinner rolls : — 

eight ounces of flour, 

one dessert-spoonful of good butter, 

two tea-spoonfuls of Yeatman^s powder, 

one salt-spoonful of salt, 

four table-spoonfuls of milk. 
Rub the butter into the flour with one of the wooden 
spoons after having spread the latter in the enamelled 
pan, sprinkle the salt over it, and mix your dough as 
lightly as you can, using both wooden spoons, and shaking 
the milk into the flour by degrees. When nicely formed, 
add the baking powder (last thing of all mark) stir it 
well into the dough, divide it into four equal portions, pat 
them into shape with the spoons, and place them in four 
patty-pans well buttered : These must be put on the 
baking-sheet, and slipped into the oven, which should have 
been heated to receive them to such a degree that you can 
hardly bear your hand inside it. The time taken in bak- 
ing depends upon the sort of oven you employ : as soon 
as the rolls brown very slightly, having risen into nice 
round forms, they are ready. This recipe may be altered 
to jive ounces of flour, and three of oatmeal, for a change, 
" French Bolls'^ : — Half a pound of flour, a dessert-spoon- 
ful of butter, one small egg^ two tea-spoonfuls of Yeat- 
man's powder, a salt-spoonful of salt, and four table-spoon- 
fuls of milk. Work the butter thoroughly into the flour. 
Beat the egg up briskly with the milk, and strain it into 
another cup, dust the salt over the flour, and gradually 
add the eggy-milk till the dough is formed ; then mix the 
baking powder into it thoroughly ; form the dough into 
two nice oblong rolls, place them on a sheet of well buttered 



320 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

paper, on the baking tin, and set them in the oven ; look 
at them after twenty minutes' baking, and take them out 
as soon as their colour indicates that they are done. 

" Half pound plain loaf : — Half a pound of flour, two 
tea-spoonfuls of Yeatman's powder, a salt-spoonful of salt, 
and four or five table-spoonfuls of water. Work this as 
above, reserving the baking powder to the last, set the 
dough in a tin, or form it in the well-known " cottage" 
shape, and bake. 

The ordinary cookery book receipts for fancy breads can 
be safely followed if you remember the proportion of the 
baking powder to the pound of flour, and, where eggs are 
propounded, make an allowance for the difference which 
exists between the English and the Indian egg. In using 
Yeatman's powder, do not let your made rolls, or bread, 
.stand waiting for the oven : see that your baking appara- 
tus is all but ready before you commence making the bread. 
You will observe that I recommend the baking powder to 
be put into the dough, not mixed with the flour in a dry 
tstate to start with. In London ^Ir. AVoolf follows the 
latter method. I cannot explain what causes it, but I 
have found that the bread never turns out so satisfactorily 
here, if the powder be put in early : the temperature may 
have something to do with this ; at all events, experience 
seems to show that the powder expends its effect to a 
great extent, during the working of the dough, if mixed 
with the flour first ; whereas, if put in as a finishing 
touch, the bread being rapidly consigned to the oven, the 
result is invariably satisfactory. 

I advise home-bakers to make rolls rather than large 
loaves. There is less waste with them. A roll is either 
eaten in toto or left untouched. If intact, you have merely 
to dip it in milk, and put it into the oven — damp ; it will 
turn out again almost as freshly as a new roll. Bread, 



CAMP COOKERY. 321 



once cnt, is apt to get dry, and with, the exception of being 
sliced for toast, or grated for bread-crumbs, is not very 
presentable a second time. In baking, be very careful 
that your flour is well sifted and thoroughly dry. In a 
moist climate like this it is advisable to dry it in the oven 
before using it ; the sifting must be carried out by a sieve. 
I have made very eatable bread with carefully sifted 
country flour, the sifting of which is an imperative neces- 
sity, be it observed, unless you have no objection to a 
gravelly loaf. 

!N'ow, let us discuss the animal and vegetable food of 
camp life, taking soups first : — 

Many people think that because they cannot get beef 
in camp, they cannot have a freshly-made soup. Now, 
there are a few capital soups requiring no meat at all, 
which are known as ''^ soupe.s maigres." I will give you 
two : — 

" Soupe a Voignon^^ : — Slice a couple of Bombay onions ; 
powder them well with floiu% let them fry awhile in a 
stew-pan with plenty of butter ; before they begin to 
brown at all, add water, pepper, and salt, let the whole 
boil till the onions are well done and serve with croutons 
of fried bread. Grated Parmesan should accompany. 

" Soupe aux choux' : — Let us assume that you have taken 
a cabbage or two with you when you left cantonment. 
Cut the cabbage into quarters, put them into a sauce-pan 
with a good sized slice of bacon, some slices of a Bologna 
sausage, and a bag containing sweet herbs, a clove of 
garlic, pepper, and a little spice ; add water enough to 
cover the whole, and let the soup simmer till the cabbage 
is done, serve with croutons of fried bread. A bacon bone 
would assist the undertaking greatly. 

But you need not condemn yourself to " soiopes an 
■niaigre' whenever there are sheep, and fowls, to be had, 



322 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

when you can shoot game, and lastly, when you are pro- 
vided with tinned soups, and preserved vegetables, espe- 
cially that excellent tablet called " Julienne.'' In camp, 
bottles of dried herbs, and tinned provisions are, of coui'se, 
indispensable, and you should be provided with potatoes, 
carrots, and onions before starting. 

Soups in tins can be turned to excellent account in this 
way : — Kill a good full-sized fowl, cut it up, and put it, 
giblets and all, into a stew-pan ; cover it with water, and 
let it come very slowly to the boil, skimming off the scum 
which may rise during that process ; when the boiling 
stage has been attained, take the pan from the fire for a 
minute and throw into it a Bombay onion, cut into 
quarters, any fresh vegetables you may have brought out, 
a bag of mixed sweet herbs, a clove of garlic, a dozen pep- 
per corns, a pinch of parsley seed, a few drops of celery 
essence, a table-spoonful of mushroom ketchup, a tea- 
spoonful of sugar, and a dessert-spoonful of salt. Now, let 
the pan boil again till the onion is soft, and then reduce 
the fire for the simmering stage. When the pieces of fowl 
are nice and tender, the broth is ready : long cooking will 
avail nothing : so lift up your pan, and strain off the broth 
into a bowl, it will be beautifully bright and clear ; 
slightly tinted with caramel (page 35) and served hot 
with a dessert-spoonful of Marsala and a dissolved dessert- 
spoonful of " Julienne^'' this consomme de volaille will be 
found sufficient for two hungry men. When used in con- 
nection with a tin of soup, the broth should be poured 
from the bowl into the pan again, and the tin of soup 
added to it ;* a slow process of boiling should now be 
commenced, during which any scum, the soup may throw 
up should be studiously removed, for all tinny impurities 
will thus be got rid of : when all but boiling, a table- 

* If a thick soup, like mockturfcle for instance, you must thicken 
the consommd with a little flour. — W. 



CAMP COOKERY, 323 



spoonful of Marsala should be added, and the soup served. 
The pieces of fowl if not over-cooked, may be served in 
the form of fricassee, or be bread-crumbed or dipped in 
batter and fried, and served with maccaroni and tomato 
conserve. 

Very valuable stock, remember, can be made from cold 
roast mutton bones — (do not try raiu mutton, the taste 
will be tallowy) — assisted by bacon skin, bones and trim- 
mings, a thick slice of Brunswick or Bologna sausage, and 
a chicken, or any game you can spare. Birds that have 
been mauled in shooting can thus be utilized. Purees of 
game can be made if you have taken out your utensils if 
not, you must make the game broth as strong as possible, 
helped by a fowl as stock, and thicken it with flour. The 
addition of Marsala or port is, of course, a sine qua non. 

Tinned fish served, — as you sometimes see salmon at a 
dinner party, — plainly, and hot is positively nasty, and in 
no way improved by a cold sauce like tartare. Who, after 
a moment's reflection, could send up hot fish with a cold 
sauce ? Preserved salmon, fresh herrings, and other 
tinned fresh fish, if served with tartare or mayonnaise 
sauces should be served cold^ after having been carefully 
drained on a sieve from all the tinny juices which adhered 
to them. Select nicely sized pieces, place them on a dish 
with any garnish you may have such as olives farcies y 
capers, sliced gherkins, and rolled anchovies, and send the 
sauce round in a boat. 

If you want a hot dish of tinned fish, you must choose 
the nicest pieces and gently warm them up in a rich 
matelote sauce, veloiite or poulette, or you must wrap them 
in oiled paper and broil them a moment. All trimmings 
and odd bits can be saved and worked up as rissoles, or in 
any of the ways I have mentioned for cold fish in my 
ch9,pter on rechauffes. 



324 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

Fresli-water fish is often to be had by men out in camp. 
In cooking them, many recipes hereafter given for filleted 
fish may be followed : clean them thoroughly, wash them 
well to get rid of all muddy taste, scale, trim, and soak 
them after cleaning, in water. A fish like murrel may be 
treated like a pike : — after having been carefully cleansed, 
and trimmed, stuff it with turkey forcemeat (page 108) 
sew it up, trim it in a circular shape with its tail in its 
mouth and bake it in a pie-dish surrounded by chicken 
stock about half an inch deep. A glass of any white wine 
like hock, chablis, or sauterne may be put into the stock, 
an onion also, and any vegetables you can spare. The 
fish should be basted every now and then, and when it 
has absorbed the gravy and seems soft, take it out of 
the oven. Put a pat of maitre d'lwtel butter on the top 
of it, and serve in its own dish with a napkin folded 
round it. A good sized murrel will take from twenty 
minutes to half an hour in baking. A stuffing made with 
a tin of oysters, well drained and cut up, mixed with a 
half pint of bread-crumbs soaked in milk or stock, some 
spiced pepper, a little chopped very finely pared lime peel, 
and a couple of minced anchov^ies, all stirred together, and 
bound with a couple of eggs, is highly acceptable with a 
murrel. If you have no oysters, pound a good quantity 
of fresh-water shrimps, and mix them with the stuffing. 

Eels ought to be slightly boiled first, whatever you do 
with them, you then get rid of their oiliness. After being 
thus treated, you can cut them into fillets for frying, for 
stewing, or for a pie. Eel fillets dipped in batter, and 
fried in oil or fat (lots of it) with a plain sharp sauce are 
delicious. The matelote will be found in the menus. 

Tinned Australian, and other preserved lumps of meat, 
are valuable additions to the store box of the jungle- 
wallah, but they require very delicate handling, because 
they are almost always overdone. The really nutritious 



CAMP COOKERY. S2l 



part of a tin of Australian meat is the gravy that sui'- 
rounds it. Uamasamy knows this, so beware of un- 
righteous dealing, see the tin opened, and have every atom 
of the gravy strained off into a bowl. In cold weather, 
during such nights as you have in the Deccan during 
December and January for instance, the gravy in these 
tins becomes a jelly, so before you open one, set it on the 
fire in a sauce-pan surrounded by hot water for ten minutes 
or so ; then open it, and strain the gravy from the tin into 
a bowl ; turn the meat out carefully upon your sieve, and 
pour some hot water gently over it ; catch the water in a 
bowl below the sieve, and add it to the gravy. Now, the 
gravy of a two -pound tin of beef will, as a rule, give you 
an excellent stock for two basins of soap : — skim the fat 
that may rise to its surface, and put it into a sauce- pan 
with a bag of dried sweet herbs, an onion cut into quarters, 
any vegetables you can spare, some pepper-corns, a pinch 
of spice, and salt according to the quantity : simmer this 
gently to extract the flavour of the things you have added, 
and in about a couple of hours you will have an excellent 
consomme, quite fit to be served as soup, with maccaroni, 
vermicelli, a couple of poached eggs, or Julienne, grated 
cheese accompanying ; a table-spoonful of Marsala will be 
a grateful finishing stroke. Or it may be thickened like 
mock-turtle, and served with forcemeat balls. 

I . The meat should be treated in this way : — choose the 
nicest looking pieces, trim them neatly, and if of a fair 
size, brush them over with egg, bread-crumb them, and 
brown them in the oven, serving a good sauce, — tomato, 
souhise, or piquante for instance, with them. Or you can 
cut the meat into collops, and hash them very gently in 
a carefully made gravy. Lastly, you can mince it and 
serve it in many nice ways, (vide page 173). 

An excellent method may be thus described : — Having 

32 



326 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

made your mince and flavoured it Tvitli a little chopped 
olive, anchovy, sausage meat, &c., bind it with a little 
good sauce thickened with a couple of eggs, and let it get 
cold : make a good sized thin pan-cake, take it from the 
pan when almost done, put -it on a dish, and arrange some 
slices of cold cooked bacon upon it, lay the mince upon 
the bacon, give it a dust of spiced pepper, and fold the 
pan-cake over it : brush it over with an egg, bread-crumb 
it, and bake it a golden brown in your oven. The pan- 
cake should be just large enough to envelope the mince in 
one fold securely. 

If you look upon a tin of preserved meat as a dish 
that has been cooked once, and has accordingly to be 
dressed en rechauffe, you will not fail to turn it to good 
account. But warmed up as it comes from the tin, 
unaided, and carelessly dished, it presents an irregular 
mass of sodden and tasteless diet which few would care 
to touch unless driven to do so by the calls of ungovern- 
able hunger. 

Messes like Messrs. Crosse and Blackwell's " ducks and 
green peas," " Irish stew," " ox cheek and vegetables," 
&c., should be avoided carefully, but if you find that your 
butler has sent such things to camp, you must pick the 
meat out of its surroundings, dress it with some fresh 
chicken meat, as a rissole, croustade or a mince, and cook 
the gravy and vegetables with some fresh chicken broth 
as a sauce. 

I have already spoken of tinned vegetables, (pages 163 
to 165) and also of the produce of the country. The 
traveller ought to try and find out what country garden 
stuff can be got from the villages near his camp. The 
recipes I have given will be found easy, and the monotony 
of tinned food will be much relieved by an occasional 
nicely dressed dish of common vegetables. 



CAMP COOKERY. 327 



I will conclude this chapter with three very reliable 
recipes for cooking a hare. If you have shot the hare 
yourself so much the better, for then you will not find its 
heart, liver and kidneys gone. Skin, clean, and wash the 
animal well, saving the three parts I have mentioned care- 
fully, and the hlood. When quite clean, wipe the carcass 
inside and out, and let it soak in the marinade mentioned 
at page 65 all day, turning it every now and then. As 
the hour for cooking approaches, fill the hare with a well- 
made stuffing as for turkey (page 108). The kidneys and 
heart should be minced, and fried in fat bacon, with a 
little onion ; when done, the contents of the pan should be 
poured into a bowl to cool, and when cold, pounded to a 
paste, and mixed with the stuffing. The back of the hare 
should be larded, or covered with thin slices of bacon 
pinned down with little skewers, it should then be roasted, 
a constant basting of melted butter or clarified beef suet 
being kept up throughout the process. When nearly done, 
the bacon strips should be removed, and the back lightly 
dredged with flour ; the skin should be allowed to brown, 
and run into crisp blisters : the hare should then be 
served, — with a sauce made as follows : — 

First make a good pint of the best gravy you can : cut 
the liver into dice, take a small sauce-pan, melt an ounce 
of butter in it, throw into it an onion finely shredded, toss 
the onion till it colours nicely, then throw in the chopped 
liver, shaking the pan for a minute or two : next add a 
little gravy, stir well, pour in all the gravy and simmer 
till the liver is cooked. Now, strain the gravy, pour into 
it the marinade of port wine, vinegar, ketchup, and red 
currant jelly in which the hare was soaked, put it on the 
fire in a sauce-pan, and pour in very slowly as it warms 
the hlood you saved in the first instance ; continue stirring, 
and the sauce will thicken, throw into it the liver pounded 
to a paste, stir and serve very hot. 



328 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 

Ramasamy sometimes envelopes his hare in a coating 
of light batter. Pray caution him never to do so again. 

" Jugged hare" is perhaps the best dish for camp life ; 
by many it is considered in any circumstances the best. 
This is a simple recipe : — Proceed as in the foregoing 
receipt as far as the skinning and cleaning is concerned. 
When ready, cut the hare up into neat pieces, dredge them 
with flour, and give them a few turns in the frying-pan with 
some butter till they take coloui*. Prepare beforehand a 
pint and a half of good strong stock (that of a fowl will do 
in camp) and choose a vessel that you can close securely 
with paste : put the pieces of hare into it, with two 
carrots, two or three large onions, an ounce of celery, the 
juice of two limes, a table-spoonful of sugar, and one of 
salt ; pour in the stock, throw in a wine-glass of brandy, 
and seal the vessel as closely as possible ; place it in a pan 
of cold water, and set it to boil, steaming the covered pot 
for three houi-s. When done, open the pot, stir into it a 
bumper glass of port, a dessert-spoonful of red currant 
jelly, and a lump of butter rolled in flour.* Serve with a 
dozen balls of stuffing made as for roast hare, and fried 
in butter. Instead of steaming the jar, it may be placed 
in the oven and baked for two or three hours. 

An excellent hash may be made of a cold roast hare in 
this way : — Trim off as much of the meat as you can find 
in slices, and cut out what remains of the stuffing : break 
up all the bones and put them with the skin and scraps 
into a stew-pan with a large onion cut up, pepper-corns, 
a bit of celery if possible, and any vegetable, a little spice, 
any sauce that may have been left, a couple of glasses of 
red wine and enough water to cover the bones, &c., sim- 
mer these ingredients for an hour and a half, and then 

* Or you may strain the gravy, thicken it with flour and butter, 
add tlie wine, &c., and pour it over the meat again. — W. 



CAMP COOKERY. 329 

strain off the gravy. Thicken it with butter and flour, 
flavour it with a dessert-spoonful of red currant jelly, a 
table- spoonful of mushroom ketchup, half a glass of vine- 
gar, and a little more red wine : heat up the slices of hare 
in this sauce taking care that they do not boil, and serve 
with the stuffing sliced and fried in butter as a garnish. 

I have found the process of " jugging" very effective 
with venison, especially with jungle-sheep. The neck and 
breast can be utilized in this manner. 

Many of the dishes detailed in the previous chapters, 
especially those spoken of under the title of " Eggs, mac- 
caroni, and cheese," will be found practicable in the camp ; 
amongst the menus, more than one nice recipe for cooking 
mutton, fowls, and chickens, has been recorded ; in short, 
if the pilgrim be blessed by the possession of an intelligent 
cook, and provided with a judicious assortment of culinary 
necessaries and stores, his tent life should never fail to 
possess amongst its many attractions that indubitably 
important one — a really good dinner.

of all kinds, see Wyvern's annotated catalogue of Messrs.

I have not attempted to treat of sweet dishes in this 
work, but the entremets sucres chosen for each bill-of-fare 
have been carefully described. 

For hors d'oeuvres, please consult the chapter I have 
devoted to them. 

The recipes given for the treatment of fish apply, it 
will be found, to the varieties of the finny tribe best 
known and esteemed at Madras, viz. : — the seer, pomfret, 
sole, grey mullet, and whiting. 

Of these the first being a large salmon-shaped fish, 
which is cut up and sold much in the same manner as 
salmon, is susceptible of being similarly cooked. Small 
seer are flabby and unfit for the table. 

The pomfret may, as far as its flavour and the texture 
of its flesh are concerned, be best compared perhaps with 

33 



3^4 NOTES TO MENU. 

the turbot or brill, but as it never reaches as great a size 
as either of those fish, it can be trimmed when desired in 
fillets, and cooked like soles. 

The sole and whiting can be treated exactly like the fishes 
of the same name at home. The only difference being that 
the Indian sole is, as a rnle, wanting in the depth of flesh 
possessed by the European variety when in proper season. 

The mullet is a far larger fish than the English grey 
mullet, and not nearly as rich. If taken in back-waters, 
it requires very careful cleaning to rid it of the muddy 
taste it acquires in such circumstances. 

Rcmembenng the peculiainties of these fish, a little re- 
flection will .enable my readers in other parts of India to 
apply the recipes I have given to almost any fish that 
may be at their disposal. 

A fish that can be easily dressed in fillets may be treated 
as a porafret or sole. One that is large and firm enough 
to be sliced can be cooked as the seer. Long trout-shaped 
fish may be served as mullet, and can be baked whole, or 
roasted a la hroche. Bony fish are best pi'epared in the 
form of puree : — boiled, passed through the sieve, and sent 
up as a so^ijljie, or a creme. Tlie becktie of Calcutta seems 
specially adapted to treatment as codfish ; at the same time 
it may be cooked in almost every way laid down for seer 
fish. The hilsa, again, approaches vei-y closely if it does 
not surpass the mackerel, and may be dressed similarly. 

Those who may try to Use this book in England should 
remember that ordinary eggs in India are far smaller 
than- those at home. I calculate that five Indian eggs 
equal three English. Again : the cream so often pro- 
pounded in my recipes is not nearly as thick and rich as 
English cream : the use therefore of cream may be tera- 
Jiered with discretion.

1. — Our first step must be the making of a bright, clear, 
consomme according to the directions 

u?nelleB ^^""^ ^'^^ ^^^^^ ^^ P^^® ^^' *° ^^^our which in 
this instance we must not forget a 
little dried basil, (which should go in with the vegetables) 
and a table-spoonful of Madeira to finish with. 

We can make the quenelles of fish, game, chicken, or of 
tinned lobster if we like. Let us choose prawn quenelles, 
and proceed as follows : — Pound a dozen and a half well- 
cleaned prawns with half their bulk of crumb of bread, 
soaked in stock ; work in with the paste two whole raw 
eggs, and season it with a pinch of salt, a dusting of 
white, or Nepaul pepper, and a tea-spoonful of anchovy

sance : when thoroughly blended, and of the right consist- 
ency, form your tiny olive-shaped quenelles between two 
tea-spoons, poach them for about fire minutes in boiling 
stock or water, drain them, and add them to the soup at the 
last moment. Quenelles used as garnish for soups should 
be lighter and more delicate than ordinary quenelles. 
Various shapes may be obtained by pressing the mixture 
into the poaching pan through a paper funnel. 

2. — This is a dish of neatly trimmed slices of seer, 

plainly stewed in a clear broth made 

Seer uith cucum- £j,q^ chicken bones and the fish trim- 

bers . -r» • 

mmgs. Put into the broth with tho 

fish a few slices of can-ot, and onion, a table-spoonful of 

dried sweet herbs, and a glass of chablis : simmer gently, 

and when done, drain the fish, and strain the gravy. 

Thicken the latter with butter and flour, and add to it 

some previously cooked fillets of cucumber about an inch 

long, and half an inch thick, and the pieces of fish : heat 

altogether, till the stew steams freely, and serve. 

For directions for preparing the cucumber, see page 156. 

3. — Here we have a mould of creme or pain de volailley 
nicely truffled. Choose a large fowl, 
'^l^^^ of chicken or two good sized chickens, and cut off 
all the white meat you can for the 
puree. With all the bones, skin, and scraps assisted by 
two sheep's feet, cleaned and cut up, and the giblets saved 
before the roasting, make as strong an essence as you can, 
following the rules for " fowl essence" (page 98). Strain 
when done, let it get cold, skim it, and then proceed to 
thicken it ; when as thick as a rich mayonnaise sauce, 
strain it, and set it in the hain-marie. 

You must treat your puree thus : — melt two ounces of 
fat bacon in a 5aw^e-pan, throw in some pepper, salt, and 
the meat of the fowl ; work them together for five minutes 
over a bright fire, then empty the contents of the pan into 



cream. 



MENU FOR A PARTY OF EIGHT. 337 

a mortar, and pound the meat and bacon to a paste ; add 
half their bulk of crumb of bread soaked in stock, and 
half a tin of white mushi'ooms, and when thoroughly incor- 
porated, pass the whole through a hair sieve. Moisten 
the 'puree with some of the sauce already described, while 
pounding it, and when finished, add four whole raw eggs. 
Now, butter a plain mould, and fill it with your puree, 
introducing a good allowance of truffles cut into dice, and 
steam it as you would a pudding in youi' Warren's pot, 
or in a stew-pan plunged into a larger vessel full of 
water. When done, let the mould get cold, and then turn 
it out. 

While the mould was being steamed, reduce the re- 
mainder of the sauce to a white glaze, let it get cool, and 
pour it gently over the mould (which should be set on ice) 
until the glaze coats it completely. When set, the pain 
is ready. 

If steamed in sl border mould, the centre may be filled 
with pointes cVasperges, fonds d^artichmits, flageolets or 
macedoine de legumes moistened with pure iced cream. 

4. — Choose a nice fillet of beef, or the tender meat of a 
piece of the ribs. Trim this into thick 
uaS'lSllu"'^'"- lieai-t-shaped fillets of a size large 
enough for one person each ; lard 
them with fat bacon, and set them to marinade all day, 
as described in Chapter VIII, page 65. When ready, drain 
them, and stew them gently in as rich a stock as you can 
make from the meat and bones you had over after shap- 
ing them, assisted by a glass of Marsala: when done, 
keep them hot in the bain-marie. • 

For the sauce, proceed as follows : — put into a stew-pan 
the yolks of seven eggs, one ounce of butter, one pinch of 
salt, and a little pepper : stir over a low fire till the yolks 
begin to thicken : take the pan off the fire and stir in one 



338 MENU FOR A PARTY OF EIGHT. 

ounce of butter more : again stii* over the fire for two 
minutes and again remove the pan, adding another ounce 
of butter. Repeat the process again twice, using in all 
five ounces of butter, stir till the sauce is rich and creamy 
looking, finally adding a dessert-spoonful of tarragon vine- 
gar, and a table-spoonful of chopped parsley. A little 
water atlded with the butter prevents curdling. 

Dish the grenadins round a ring of carefully mashed 
potato, introducing a slice of crisply fried bacon between 
each of them, and serve the sauce piping hot in a boat. 
In the hollow formed by the potato ring, you can put some 
flageolets a la maltre d'hufel, ov petits pois. 

5. — Speaks for itself. Pray follow my advice about 
trimming your French beans, (page 
.iSocbbe^u.""" !•"> '^"'l.'iish them with a pat of 
butter boiling hot, added at the very 
last moment. The best way by far to cook the beans provid- 
ed they are young and tender, is in the jar like peas, (page 
135) or in the steamer of a Wan^en's pot ; trim the beans 
as explained already, and put them into the jar or steamer, 
with a table-spoonful of butter, a dessert-spoonful of 
sugar, and a large tea-spoonful of salt. Steam the jar 
as described for peas : when done, drain the beans, and 
serve with a pat of butter boiling hot. 

Unless French beans are young and tender, it is useless 
trying to cook them in the jar. A tin of haricots verts 
should, in this case, be substituted. 

6. — Buy eight fat quails, four sheep's tongues, half a 
pound of lamb's liver, and a couple of 

Jet'V'rtvS-e l^'^'^'J^ °f ?'-^^y '^'^^t- ^^''^^ ^^-^ "^t 
sauce. once with the last, stew the tongues, 

and bone the quails : throw the bones 

into the gravy, and all scraps you may have of bacon. 



MENU FOR A PARTY OF EIGHT. 



&C.J next trim your cold sheep's tongues, and cut eight 
nice fillets, the size of a walnut, from the centre of them. 

Now, place your boned-birds, bi^ast downwards, on a 
board, and dust them over with spiced pepper. Pro- 
ceed to make a forcemeat thus : — Melt a couple of thick 
slices of fat bacon in a frying-pan ; when melted, throw in 
three table-spoonfuls of the lamb's liver, with those of the 
birds too, cut into dice, and one onion shredded finely ; 
cook the liver in this, and when done, empty the contents 
of your pan, melted bacon and all, into a mortar, throw in 
the remains of the sheep's tongues which were left after 
making the fillets, a pinch of salt, pepper, and grated 
nutmeg, work this to a paste, pass it through the sieve, 
add some finely minced parsley, a dessert-spoonful of spiced 
pepper, a little grated lime peel, and a table-spoonful of 
chopped truffles fsaved from entree No. 1) ; work this 
again thoroughly, and spread a layer of it over the flatten- 
ed quails : place one of the tongue fillets in the centre of 
each quail, and spread another layer of your forcemeat 
over each. 

Now, gather the birds into shape neatly, sewing the skin 
together securely, and stew the little galantines in the 
previously made gravy, with a little red currant jelly, a 
glass of sherry, and half a wine-glass of vinegar : when 
done, lift them out, drain off the gravy, and reduce it to a 
glaze (page 219) : paint your galantines over with the 
glaze when cold, arrange them upon a dish which should 
be set upon ice, and garnish your dish with parsley, and 
slices of lime. Sauce tartare, also iced, should accompany. 

7. — For this dish (see page 146) I recommend you to 
try little shortbread biscuits in which 

Spinach with some finely grated mild cheese has 
been mixed ; the cakes should be 
heart-shaped, or round, and quite crisply baked like 
cheese-finpfers.

8. — A simple, and refined cold sweet entremets. Dilute 

a pot of strawberry jam with suffi- 

Mould of straw- ^:^^^^ ^^^^^, ^^ ^^^^ enough syrup to 

fill your mould, strain it, colour it a 
rosy pink with a drop or two of cochineal, and add a glass 
of liqueur or brandy ; melt an ounce of gelatine, and 
strain it, when cold, into the syrup, stirring well : — decorate 
a plain mould w4th almonds, put it on ice, and pour your 
strawberry syrup into it by degrees ; cover it over, and 
set it in ice for two hours ; turn it out, and serve it with 
cold custard in glasses, or iced cream. If in season, you 
can, of course, make the syrup with fresh strawberries ; 
and when filling the mould, you may add to its attractive- 
ness by setting layers of whole fruit (fresh or preserved) 
in it in the style of a jelly. 

9. — Make a cake case (see Menu No. IV,) with finger 

biscuits, or slices of sponge cake and 

Iced apricot cream j^^. ^^ |. ^^^ ^^^^^ ^ j.^^j^ CUStard,

flavour it with a dash of liqueur, and 

mix into it half an ounce of dissolved gelatine. Work 
the mixture in the ice pail until it begins to freeze well, 
then stir into it a good allowance of chopped crystallized 
apricots and a coffee-cupful of rich cream well whipped. 
Mix well in the ice pail, and then fill a mould with the 
frozen mixture, completely covering it with lumps of ice. 
It should be left thus for an houi', when it wall be ready 
to turn out and serve. The mould should be just large 
enough to be covered by the cake case. 

Note. — To adapt this menu according to the new regime^ 
serve the saddle after the fish, and instead of galantines 
of quails, let the birds be roasted with a slice of fat bacon 
over their breasts, and sent round with bread sauce, fried 
crumbs, and filbert chips of potato. A plain salade or 
water-cress should accompany the rot.

1. — The French preserved Julienne is now regularly 
received by a well-known firm at 
Madras. Armed with one of these 
tablets, you can achieve a Julienne soup which will at once 
show you what a lamentable burlesque of the true potage 
you have hitherto accepted without a murmur from your 
Ramasamy. Having made a good, strong, and clear 
consomme sufficient for your party, all you have to do is 
to cut off a portion of your Julieyme tablet, which should 
be simply placed in a sauce-pan with a large allowance of 
boiling water, or weak stock, and allowed to cook until the 
pieces of vegetable detach themselves, and appear nice and 
tender : drain them when thus ready^ and add them to 

34 



342 MENU FOR A PARTY OF EIGHT. 



your consomme Tvitli a pinch of sugar, and a table-spoon- 
ful of Madeira. Each tablet is marked for five portions. 
Remember that a portion is enough for tivo persons : I 
have found a table-spoonful of crumbled Julienne enough 
for three basins of soup. To preserve the tablet in this 
climate, I recommend you to break it up carefully, and 
cork it down in a dry bottle. 

For the benefit of those Tvho cannot avail themselves of 
this excellent pi-eparation, the following directions may 
be given : — Take equal parts of can^ots, turnips, leeks, 
onions, and celery ; cut them all into thin strips not moi'e 
than the eighth of an inch across, and an inch long. Put 
them into a sauce-pan with a couple of ounces of fresh 
butter, a tea-spoonful of powdered sugar, a little pepper, 
and a pinch of salt. Toss them lightly on the fire until 
they take colour slightly, say for five minutes or so, cover 
them with a little bi'oth from the consomme and cai'efully 
remove the grease thrown up by the butter. Let the 
vegetables thus cooked remain in the gravy near the fire, 
nice and hot, until the time of serving, when they should 
be added with a few leaves of lettuce and of sorrel finely 
shredded to the rest of the co^nsomme, brought to the boil, 
finally skimmed, and sent up. 

2. — Stew a couple of handsome slices of seer fish in a 
good broth made from bones and trim- 
Secr TTith truffle mings, assisted by an onion, a carrot, 
a bunch of parsley, a dessert-spoonful 
of preserved thyme and mai-jorara, a minced anchovy, a 
dozen pepper corns, a table-spoonful of mushroom ketchup, 
a table-spoonful of Harvey sauce, a table-spoonful of vine- 
gar, a table-spoonful of chablis or sauteme. Let the fish 
slices cook slowly in this broth, and when done, drain and 
place them in a veiy hot dish, carefully covered up. 
Strain the broth in which they were cooked, thicken it, 
add a little well browned gravy, and throw into it a couple 



MENU FOR A PARTY OF EIGHT. 343 

of table-spoonfuls of chopped truffles (previously tossed in 
a frying-pan in an ounce butter, and a table-spoonful of 
Madeira) and let the sauce simmer for ten minutes to 
extract the flavour of the truffles. When ready, pour it 
over the slices and serve. 

3. — Broil the fillets (which should be cut from the under- 
cut of a sirloin, larded with bacon, and 
anSovy c^/eam!' "'"' marinaded all day) oyer a bright fire, 
and serve them round a chaplet of 
mashed potato, in the centre of which you may place a 
'puree of spinach, or a bunch of water-cress. 

For the sauce (which should go round very hot, in a 
boat) take six anchovies from the tin, wipe them dry, free 
them from the oil, and pass them through the sieve : add 
the pulp to about half a pint of good veloute (page 99) 
heat it up, and as you serve, enrich the sauce with a ladle- 
ful of good cream. 

4. — Make your cassolettes as follows : — peel two pounds 
of potatoes, cook them as usual ; when

little salt, and stir them over the fire 
for five minutes. Now, pass them through the sieve : pat 
them to a paste, and flatten that out on your slab about 
two inches thick. Let it get cold : then with your cutter, 
cut it into cylinders (or little drums) two inches in dia- 
meter. Egg and bread-crumb each cylinder, and fry these 
potato drums till they are a bright golden yellow. ISTow, 
carefully slice off the top of each drum (say) a quarter of an 
inch thick ; place the caps so obtained on one side, scoop 
out the interior of your drums very carefully, and put 
the cases out of the way, well covered up. As dinner 
time draws near, fill up each cassolette, with a portion of 
ragout a la jinanciere, (q. v.) place the caps on the top of 
each, and a few minutes in the oven will bring them to

perfection. The cases should, of course, be prepared early 
in the day, and the ragout also : the former should only 
be filled up just when required. Serve the cassolettes 
upon a napkin, and garnish them with fried parsley.

silver plated coquille shells (easily and cheaply made 

locally), butter them, and fill them with plain artichoke 

puree made as follows : — Boil the artichokes ; when cold, 

strip them of their leaves, scraping off all the pulp which 

adheres to them with a silver dessert-knife : then extract 

the " chokes," and add the " bottoms" of the artichokes to 

the leaf pulp. Mash the whole together with a silver 

fork, dust it with salt and pepper, mix a coffee-cupful of 

thick cream with it, stir it well, and fill the coquilles, dust 

over the surface a layer of very finely sifted bread-crumbs, 

sprinkle some little bits of butter over the crumbs, bake 

till thoroughly hot, brown the surface with a hot iron, and 

serve on a napkin. This is equally practicable with

egg-froth in separate table-spoonfuls upon its surface. A 
few seconds will cook each spoonful of froth on one side, 
then turn it over, and when cooked on the other side, 
place it in a glass dish. When all the egg-froth is thus 
cooked, strain the milk free from the bits of eggs that may 
be in it, and make a rich custard with it, using the yolks 
of the eggs ; flavoui' this as you like best : when cold, 
pour the custard gently into the glass dish (not over the 
boiled whites) and the snow will rise, and float on the 
surface of the custard. Sprinkle over the snow balls, and 
surface generally, a few of those tiny sugar plums called 
" non pareil," and serve.

en bain-marie, and adding the strained yolks of ten eggs : 
when the custard has formed nicely, strain it through a 
fine sieve ; whisk it well adding enough spinach-greening 
(page 50) to tint the mixture a very pale green, and 
freeze it, working into it a coffee-cupful of whipped cream

minutes in a quick oven, and when done, remove the paper, 
and arrange the slices neatly in a hot dish. 

For the sauce : — To the liquor from the pie-dish add a 
quarter of a pint of cream, a table-spoonful of walnut 
catsup, and half one of anchovy sauce ; boil these together, 
and just before you remove the sauce-pan from the fire, 
stir in well a bit of butter the size of a walnut rolled in 
flour, with a thought of red pepper.

and introduce some pieces of truffle 
judiciously here and there by making incisions with a 
sharp, pointed, root knife. 

Pieces of tongue may also be inserted in this manner ; 
they should be cut square at the head and tapering to a 
point like nails. Meat treated by this process is called 
chute by French cooks. 



MENU FOR A PARTY OF EIGHT. 349 

When ready, stew the cutlets very tenderly in gravy 
made from the bones, flap, and trimmings ; take them out, 
and set them to get cold with a weight above them ; when 
cold, mask the cutlets on one side only with reduced 
bechamel, or Espagnole sauce. When this mask or glaze 
has set, trim the edges neatly, and the cutlet is ready. 

You must now prepare the socle or stand upon which 
to arrange your cutlets. This is made of ground rice, 
and is not intended to be eaten. Wash a pound of rice, 
and boil it gently with a little salt. When soft, pound it 
in a mortar, and mould it to the shape required. In this 
case we want a circle about three inches high with a hol- 
low centre for a salad, and sloped gently on its outer rim 
to admit of the cutlets being laid upon it securely. 
When formed satisfactorily, the socle should be coated 
with butter or white sauce, and the cutlets arranged round 
its outer face. They should have their masked sides out- 
wards. The hollow centre of the socle should be filled 
with a salade cuite of mixed cold cooked peas, flageolets, 
French beans cut in diamonds, stars of carrot, &c. The 
top of the socle may be formed sufficiently wide to admit 
of a garnish of white of egg, turned carrots, &c., being 
laid upon it. 

When completed, this entree should be kept in the ice 
box till wanted. With the exception of the mayonnaise 
dressing, which should be separately made, and poured 
over the salad just before serving, it can be made early in 
the day, and is consequently so much off the cook's hands 
as the dinner hour arrives. It will be found vastly better 
than the everlasting |?(Xi^f?' defoie gras en aspic. Iced cream 
may be used instead of mayonnaise dressing, and the 
salade may be coidiposed of flageolets, pointes d'asperges,

three or tonr of cold water : mix into 

this three table-spoonfuls of flour, and a salt-spoonful of 
salt ; beat this to a paste for ten minutes, preparing a 
ratlier thicker batter than you would for ordinary fritters : 
at the time of using, stir in the whites of the three eggs 
whipped to a stifi froth. 

Wash your oysters (about a dozen and a half good ones) 
early in the day. Parboil them, if fresh, beard them, 
and put them to marinade for two hours in the juice of 
three or four limes, a sliced onion, some whole pepper and 
a few cloves. Lift them out of this when wanted, cut 
them up, bind the mince together with a liaison of yolks 
of eggs and thick white sauce, and let it get cold and finn. 
Then divide it into six portions, each the size of an ordi- 
nary wine cork, and place them on six slices of previously 
boiled bacon ; roll up your bacon fillets, and fix them with 
white of egQ ; dip them now into the batter, and lay them, 
ever so gently, in your frying basket, plunge this into a 
seething bath of fat, and fry a golden yellow. Serve 
prettily garnished with curly parsley. 

Instead of bacon, very thin wafer-like pancakes may be 
used cut into pieces the required size : and cow's udder 
is recommended by some authors.

sugar, a table-spoonful of Marsala, and a tea-spoonful of 
chilli vinegar ; now add the boiled rinds, stir till the sauce 
boils, and serve in a boat. 

7. — Wash the contents of a tin of petits pois in cold 

water, by emptying the tin into your 

Green peas with strainer and pouring a jug of water 

over them. Put them into a jar, (or

spoonful of fresh butter, a tea-spoonful of sifted sugar, 

and a tea-spoonful of salt with a little bundle of mint

take the crab. Make ordinary clear consomme for the 

number you expect. One large crab or two small ones 

will suffice for eight basins. Boil the crab : drain and 

clean it : pick out the flesh, saving that of the claws for 

garnishing. Pound the rest of the meat and shells in a 

mortar, put the whole of it into the consomme you have 

made, with a little bag containing a quarter ounce of dried 

basil, and boil gently for half an hour, strain through a 

fine sieve, or tamis cloth, — it should now be bright and 

clear, — heat it up again, and pour it into your soup tureen 

over some little quenelles made of the claw meat you saved

A table-spoonful of Madeira and the juice of half a lime, 

constitute the finishing touches of this soup.

Pomfret fillets with qj^^ side with a very little finely minc- 
Foulette sauce. *' '' 

ed (cooked) onion, parsley, and the 

trimmings of the mushi'ooms you are about to use for the 
sauce. Roll them np enveloping the seasoning within 
each fillet. Now set them to simmer gently till done, in a 
court houillon, or broth made from their own bones and 
trimmings, assisted by a breakfast-cupful of stock, a spoon- 
ful of chablis and a spoonful of vinegar. Lift them out 
when done, strain off the broth, thicken it as carefully as 
you can in the hain-maric with a little flour, and butter, 
and the strained yolks of four eggs, add a dozen button 
mushrooms cut into quarters, a little white pepper and 
salt, and as you take it off the fire, stir in a table-spoonful 
of cream. Pour this over your fillets which have, of 
course, been kept hot in the hain-marie whilst the sauce 
was being made. 

3. — These are croquettes made of duck and arc exceed- 
ingly nice. Roast the bird lightly,

meat from the bones, saving every 
atom of skin, bone, liver, &c. Put the meat away for 
awhile, giving it a good dusting with black pepper and 
salt. 

Now for the sauce : — Mince an onion, and one clove of 
garlic (a sine qua non) and stir the mince into a table- 
spoonful of melted butter at the bottom of a small sauce- 
pan, let it fry a pale brown, now throw in all your 
fragments of duck, having mashed the bones in a mortar, a 
breakfast-cupful of strong gravy, the rind of a lime ; a 
dozen pepper corns, a pinch of sugar, and salt to taste : 
add water enough to cover the bones well, and let the 



MENU FOR A PARTY OF EIGHT. 355 

contents of the sauce-pan simmer, skimming off the scum 
that rises. In half an hour you will have a well- flavoured 
broth. When quite satisfied with the broth, strain it off, 
let it cool, skim it, and thicken it plainly with flour and 
butter. Place the sauce-pan in the 6ai?i-mar*e-pan, and 
let it keep hot there. Now take a tumblerful of sauterne, 
put it into a small sauce-pan with a table-spoonful of 
minced onion, a sait-spoonful of black pepper, and a pinch 
of salt. Boil till the liquid has been reduced to half its 
original quantity. Then strain it into the previously 
made sauce. Give the whole a simmer for ten minutes 
and serve. 

In this instance we make our gravy or foundation of 
the sauce with the duck bones, &c., for the sake of eco- 
nomy. The basis of true Bordelaise is Esjpagnole. 

In making the croquettes of the duck meat you saved, 
use some minced bacon, lean and fat in equal shares, one 
tea-spoonful to each croquette, the bii^d's liver, any truffle 
or mushroom parings there may be to spare, and put one 
olive farcie whole hi the centre of each : season the pound- 
ed meat with pepper and salt, do not use any spice, but 
dry some sage leaves in the oven, and make a powder of 
them, giving about half a salt-spoonful of the powder to 
each croquette. Bind the croquettes with egg, form them 
into egg-shaped balls, bread-crumb them in the usual 
way, and fry them a pale golden yellow in abundance of 
fat. Dish them round a ring of mashed potato, filling 
the centre with a pyramid of joetits pais verts, and sending 
round the Bordelaise sauce, piping hot, in a boat.

onions, cut them up roughly and put them into a sauce- 
pan with a ladleful of butter, a pincTi of sugai', and pepper 
and salt to fancy ; let them cook slowly so that they do 
not take colour, add a table-spoonful of boiled rice, or 
pearl barley, and a cupful of broth and let the simmering 
go on till the lumps of onion are quite soft ; then add 
a heaped up table-spoonful of finely grated cheese, stir 
this in well for a minute or two, then lift it up, and 
work the mixture through the sieve as you would a puree. 
Heat it up gently in the bain-marie, and at the last 
stir in a table-spoonful of rich cream. Serve the cutlets 
round a wall of ' savoury rice' and fill in the centre with 
French beans a la maitre d' hotel. Let the sauce go round 
in a boat with the entree : it ought to be a thick creamy- 
looking sauce of the consistency of tartars.

liquid cool, and strain it through a jelly bag, pouring it 
back and straining again until it is quite clear. When 
cold, flavour the jelly with maraschino, a wine-glass will 
be sufficient, and let it rest awhile. IS'ow prepare a 
macedoine of fruits, preserved cherries, strawberries, 
apricots, greengages, and raspberries, and fill the jelly 
mould as follows : — first set it upon ice, and pour into it 
about one-eighth thickness of the jelly, arrange some fruit 
tastefully in this layer, cover it with jelly, and continue 
layers of fruit and of jelly until the mould is nearly full, 
then finish it with jelly only, cover the mould with ice, 
and turn it out when finally set and quite firm. Iced 
cream en hloc may accompany. 

8. — This is an iced pudding flavoured with chocolate.

the eighth of an inch thick, and an inch and a half wide : 
cut a circular piece the size of the bottom of the mould. 
Make a cement with the whites of three eggs, and an 
ounce of finely sifted sugar. Arrange the slices round 
the side of the mould slightly overlapping one another, 
and cement them firmly together, fixing their ends to the 
circular top placed at the bottom of the mould. "When 
the cement dries, the case will be quite firm. Choose a 
mould for the ice slightly smaller than this case, so that 
the latter may cover it nicely. When firmly set, the cake 
case may be turned out upon a dish, and its outside 
brushed over with some thin cement, and sprinkled over

pint of cream, a tea-spoonful of vanilla essence and the 
yolks of ten eggs : make a custard of the mixture adding 
two ounces of sugar. Stir in half an ounce of dissolved 
gelatine while the custard is warm, and whip it briskly 
and put it into the freezer. Freeze, mixing into the half-

mushrooms. Now, butter a nice sized pie-dish (not too 
deep in the sides) and arrange the maccaroni on the 
bottom of it : dust over the maccaroni a little of the 
Parmesan : now put a layer of the sliced tomatoes, and 
arrange your portions of fish thereon with a piece of 
mushroom between each of them, and a slice of tomato in 
the centre of each : pour a breakfast-cupful of sauce blonde 
over all, give a light surface dressing of Parmesan and 
bake the dish for about a quarter of an hour. A little 
pepper and salt should be shaken gently over each layer 
as you pack the dish. There is so much moisture in the 
tomatoes, that only a very little white wine like chablis, 
hock, or sauternc, or gravy should be added as a finishing 
touch. The oven should be quite hot.

made as follows : — 

Put into a sauce-pan, one Bellary onion cut into rings, 
two sprigs of curled parsley, two ounces of pounded lean 
ham or bacon, a clove of garlic, a carrot cut up, and a 
tea-spoonful of thyme leaves ; cover them with a pint of 
Espagnole sauce (page 96) and add two tea-spoonfuls of 
anchovy vinegar, and one of chilli vinegar. Boil up, sim- 
mer for ten minutes, skimming carefully, then boil again 
reducing the sauce to the thickness of cream : now add a 
dessert-spoonful of red currant jelly and one of good mush- 
room ketchup ; stir till the jelly is dissolved, adding half 
a glass of Madeira ; stir again, and pass the sauce through 
the strainer : keep it hot in the bain-marie, and add just 
before serving, the following mixture : — the whites of two 
hard-boiled eggs, four black Leicestershire mushrooms, 
two gherkins, and half an ounce of lean ham, all chojDped 
up into small dice, and dusted over with white pepper.

vent, with pieces of rabbit, slices, or dice of tongue or ham, 
the rabbit's kidney, and the other ingredients, cut to fit 
the cases, moistening the whole well with your creamy

should be fixed with skewers : lard it with fat bacon, wrap 
it in buttered paper and tie it to your spit with string. 
Let it be roasted over a clear fire, and served in thin 
slices. 

Chateaubriand sauce is made in this way : — Add half a

side only with a beaten egg, now shake over them a tea- 
spoonful of finely minced parsley, the same of cooked 
onion chopped fine, a dessert-spoonful of minced mush- 
room, and a little white pepper : roll up your fillets and 
pin them into shape with a small skewer. Now strain off 
yovil- liquor from the bones and trimmings, give it a table- 
spoonful of chablis or sauterne, and set your fillets in it to 
simmer gently till done (they should take about twelve or 
fourteen minutes) take them out, draw out the skewers, 
set them on a very hot dish, and cover them up. Now melt 
a lump of butter quickly in a sauce-pan, work a spoonful 
of flour into it : throw in a little salt, with a pinch of sugar, 
and moisten with as much of the fish broth as will make a 
nice white sauce to cover your fillets ; add, as you take the 
sauce-pan off the fire, the yolk of an egg, a tea-spoonful of 
anchovy vinegar, a table-spoonful of very finely chopped 
parsley, a tea-spoonful of minced marjoram, and a tea- 
spoonful of minced gai-den cress. Pour it ovei' your fillets 
and serve. 

3. — Braise a breast of mutton in a stew-pan with some 
white wine and water, an onion, two 
Avfth'f ' h"acL^ °'"^^''" tomatoes, carrots, celery, whole pep- 
per, salt, a clove of garlic, some pars- 
ley, and a tea-spoonful of dried thyme. When sufficiently 
done to enable you to remove the bones, draw the pan from 
the fire, take out the breast, and pick out the bones ; then 
place it flat on a dish with a heavy weight upon it : strain 
the broth and vegetables in which the meat was cooked, 
putting the vegetables aside, and setting the gravy to cool 



MENU FOR A PARTY OF EIGHT 367 

These operations should be performed early in the day. 
When the breast has become thoroughly cold, remove the 
weight, and divide the meat into eight nice collops. Brush 
them over with egg, and bi-ead-crumb them with some 
very finely sifted stale bread-crumbs crisped in the oven. 
Let them stand for an hour, and repeat the process, — re- 
crumbing them again. iSTow fry them in boiling fat a nice 
golden yellow, take them out, drain them dry, and arrange 
them round a ring of spinach (page 145) garnished with 
hard-boiled eggs neatly cut up, and fried parsley. 

For the sauce : — skim every atom of fat from the gravy 
you set to get cold, put a lump of butter in a sauce-pan, 
work a little flour into it when melted, gradually add your 
gravy; stir well, and let the sauce thicken, add some 
caramel colouring, a dessert-spoonful of sherry, and a tea- 
spoonful of red currant jelly, and put this into a hot 
sauce boat, and serve. The sauce should be as thick as 
ordinary rich cream. A few dice of sliced cornichons 
(gherkins) may be mingled with the sauce, or minced 
mushrooms if you have them. 

4. — Choose a nice pullet not quite full grown ; cut it up, 
saving all the meat from the breast,

flavoured white sauce, giblets, into a sauce-pan to make broth 

for the sauce. N^ow make a coffee- 
cupful of stiff paste with a little butter, flour, water, and 
a pinch of salt ; when ready, take half the quantity of 
butter that you have of chicken meat, and half the amount 
of the paste that you have of butter : mince the chicken in 
the machine, and pound it in a mortar with the paste and 
butter ; bind the mixture with three eggs, flavour it with 
a little spiced pepper, and from the queyielles between two 
table-spoons. For a dinner party, you would, no doubt, 
put a nice piece of truffle inside each quenelle. 



MENU FOR A PARTY OF EIGHT. 



For the sauce : — take equal portions of carrot, peas,. 
turnip, Frencli beans, and cucumber^ all previously boiled ; 
cut them into dice and heat them up in a white sauce 
made with the water in which they were boiled, and 
enriched with the chicken broth, which should be slightly 
flavoui'ed with almond. In this case make your socle 
of savoury rice instead of the usual mashed potato : that 
is, boiled rice, flavoured with salt, a little spice, the 
pulp of a tomato, and a little finely grated cheese, stirred 
well with melted butter, and made firm by the addition of 
the yolks of two or three cgg^, according to the quantity 
required. This should be set in the silver dish, formed in 
a circle, brushed with egg, bread-crumbed, and slightly 
browned in the oven ; the quenelles, carefully poached, 
should then be arranged round it, the macedoine being^ 
poured into the centre.

all the bones, remnants of meat, and the trails of the 
snipe in as much common stock as will cover them well ; 
dried thyme, lime peel, a pinch of spice, a tomato, one 
onion sliced, and some lean bacon or ham should accom- 
pany the bones ; after you have simmered this for half an 
hour, strain the liquor clear, and thicken it with butter and 
flour as previously described ; slice two or three truffles, 
toss the slices in a frying-pan with an ounce of butter, 
adding a table-spoonful of Madeira, let the truffles simmer

stir continually, flavour it with red currant jelly, half a 

glass of Madeira, and lime juice, reduce it to a firm 

glaze, and put it aside to get cool. Glaze the fillets. 

Decorate a border mould with hard-boiled egg, gherkins, 

and olives, fill it with aspic jelly, and set in the ice-box. 

As dinner hour approaches, turn out the border of jelly, 

and pack the hollow in the centre of it with layers of 

glazed fillets, and the pieces of truffle here and there, 

let the whole remain as long as you can in ice, and serve 

with crisp, dry toast " in waiting."

dish that will stand the fire, well buttered, — the flower in 
the centre, and the tender leaves neatly arranged round it, 
— give it a dust of white pepper and a dream of salt, then 
pour round, so that all the crevices may be filled, a break- 
fast-cupful of veloute au fromage, page 242. Sprinkle a 
layer of grated Parmesan over the surface, and bake the 
dish in a quick oven for ten minutes or a quarter of an 
hour, — lastly, by passing a red hot iron just over the top, 
brown the surface of the cheese.

minutes. Now spread the almonds on a dish to cool, and 
when cold, pound them to a 'puree saving a few, which 
should only be minced roughly, and stirred into the ice 
when nearly formed. Mix a pint and a half of very rich 
custard, and stir the burnt almond puree into it while 
quite hot, strain, wliip, and add half an ounce of dissolved 
gelatine. Next put the custard into the pail, adding a 
breakfast-cupful of whipped cream, and finishing it as 
explained in the menu previously quoted. 



Note. — The only change necessary in this memi is to 
send the quarter of lamb after the fish, and roast tlic 
snipes, serving them with fried potato chips, bread-crumbs, 
and a nice salad.

Clear soup \i\i\i cus 
tard tablets. 



1. — This is a bright clear soup into which tablets of 
consolidated custard are cunningly in- 
troduced. Proceed therefore to make 
consomme for eight covers, and make 
your custard thus : — mix the yolks of four eggs with a 
little water and a pinch of salt, strain the mixture, and 
divide it into three equal portions ; colour one with cochi- 
neal, one with spinach-greening, and leave the third plain : 
pour them into three little moulds previously buttered, 
and dip them into a pan of hot water : steam just long 
enough to set the custards : take them off the fire, and 
when cold, turn the moulds out on a napkin : cut them up 
into dice or any pretty shapes with your vegetable cutter 
as gently as possible, and add them to the soup just before 



372 MENU FOR A PARTY OF EIGHT. 

serving. The colouring of the custard is obviously op- 
tional. I have found a slight deviation from this receipt 
very nice, as follows : — mix a small omelette, flavour it 
with parsley and shallot, and let it set rather more firmly 
than you would were it required for breakfast : let it get 
cold, and cut it up for the soup with the vegetable cutter 
as described for the custard. Grated Parmesan should 
be handed round. 

2. — Divide your pomfrct into nice fillets, G^g them on 
one side, and shake over the egg some 

d'Kf^'liiou'''^'^ ^^^^^y minced curled parsley. Sim- 
mer the fillets, neatly rolled up and 
skewered, in broth made from their own bones and trim- 
mings, and dish them on a hot dish as soon as they are done. 
Now melt an ounce of butter in a small sauce-pan, work 
into it a table-spoonful of flour, moisten with half a pint 
of the liquor in which the fillets were cooked, throw in 
a table-spoonful of finely chopped curled parsley, and 
finish the sauce, of the fire, with the yolk of an egg beaten 
up with the juice of a lime : pour over the fillets and 
serve. 

3. — Lightly roast eight young pigeons : slice the breasts 
of the birds off whole, and place the 

•f/"r iL'^L-L' f.ll" eight portions so obtained en marinade 
with uenevoise sauce. o i ^ 

in oil, vinegar, minced parsley, and 
shallot. Take the bones, trimmings, livers, &c., and put 
them into a sauce-pan with a good breakfast-cupful of 
gravy ; simmer this until you have extracted the essence 
of your pigeon scraps, and then strain it. Now chop 
up an onion, and one clove of garlic (a sine qua non) 
Yerj small : stir a piece of butter the size of an hen's egg 
at the bottom of a sauce- pan over the fire, and throw in 
your chopped onion, &c., let it slightly brown, and then 
add the gravy you previously made, with two or three 
anchovies chopped into dice, pepper and salt to taste, and 



MENU FOR A PARTY OF EIGHT. 373 

the juice of a lime, -with one glass of claret. Bring this 
sauce to boiling point, let it simmer awhile, and then 
strain it. Replace it in the sauce-pan, thicken it with 
butter and a little flour, colour it with caramel, and place 
your six fillets in it to gently heat up without coming to 
the boil ; when quite hot, place the fillets in their dish, 
pouring the sauce round them and serve, with a crisply 
fried curl of bacon, between each of them. Petits 'pois 
verts should fill the centre of the dish. 

4. — Put eight nicely trimmed choplets of mutton into a 
stew-pan with some scraps of bacon, 

Mal^tenSn."^^'^' ^ ^"^ ^^i^^' c^^^^*' ^^^^^^ ^^^^^s, pepper, salt, 
and a pinch of grated nutmeg, with a 
pint of good gravy, and a glass of sherry, and gently stew 
the little chops till done. 'Now lay them out on a large 
dish, covered by another with a weight upon it ; when 
quite cold, trim them finally into shape if necessary. 
Meanwhile strain the gravy in which they were stewed, 
remove all fat, and set it on one side. I^ow mince an onion 
very small, and a few capers, with two or three truffles also. 
Fry the onions a golden brown, add the minced capers 
and truffles with pepper, salt, and a spoonful of chopped 
parsley, moisten with a little of the gravy, thicken it with 
a couple of eggs, and then put the mince away to get 
cold : cut some papers for your cutlets and oil or butter 
them : now spread your cold thick mince over your cutlets 
liberally, roll them, or rather fold them in their papers 
most carefully, and broil them on the grid-iron sufficiently 
long to heat them thoroughly ; — or if preferred, they can 
be just as well heated in the oven. Serve your cutlets in 
their papers, and let a rich sauce be handed round in a 
boat made of the remains of the gravy originally got from 
the cooking of the cutlets, slightly thickened with butter 
and flour, flavoured with red currant jelly, anchovy vine- 
gar, and a spoonful of sherry, all jiidiciously applied.

Take one ounce of cocoa powder, and stir it into a pint 
of boiling milk, adding two ounces of sugar ; when 
thoroughly mixed, strain the milk through a piece of 
muslin. Let it get quite cold, and then add to it the 
strained yolks of eight eggs, making therewith a rich 
custard. Set the custard upon ice, having stirred an ounce 
of dissolved gelatine into it, and when it begins to set, add 
a coffee-cupful of whipped cream, mix thoroughly, and 
prepare the Bavaroise as follows : — place a mould on ice 
and pour into it a layer of the vanilla jelly half an inch 
thick, when set, pour in about an inch of the cream, then 
a layer of jelly when the cream has set, and so on until 
the mould is filled. Serve after it has rested on ice for an 
hour.

them at Madras, I think we may sup- 
ply their place with almonds, and make our pudding in 
this way : — Blanch and peel a quarter of a pound of sweet 
almonds (shelled) and two bitter ones. Put them into a 
stew-pan with a pint of syrup flavoured with vanilla. 
Simmer till the almonds are soft, then drain them, pound 
them in a mortar, and pass them through a fine sieve. 
Put ten yolks of eggs with a quarter of a pound of sugar 
into a pint and a half of cream (or good milk), stir over 
the fire till the custard thickens, then add the almond 
puree^ strain it into a bowl, whip it, and give the liquid 
a glass of maraschino. Stone two ounces of raisins, pick 
and wash two ounces of currants, and cut up two ounces 
of citron, cook them in the syrup saved from the almonds, 
drain and let them get cool. Now freeze the custard, 
and work it with the spatula ; when partly frozen, add 
a breakfast-cupful of whipped cream, and when the

cream is nearly set, work in tlie raisins, currants and 
citron : now close the mould, and bury it in ice for a 
conple of hours. 

Observe that Nesselrode pudding is not served inside 
a cake, or fineer-biscuit case. 



Note. — To adapt this menu, introduce a Filet de hoeuf a 
Vltalienne (page 189) after the fish, cut out the canajpes 
de hecassines, and substitute flageolets a la creme as an 
entremets de legume with the rot. A hen turkey (dinde) 
may be served instead of the cock-bird, and a nice salad

Green butter with herring roes 

Make a quarter of a pound of fresh butter from cream 
that you have set at home, and put it in ice : boil a hand- 
ful of spinach till tender, and then pass it through the 
sieve : save the pulp carefully and give it a dust of pepper. 
Take the roes (soft) of two herrings a la sardine from the 
tin, wipe them carefully to get rid of the oil, then pound 
them, in a mortar, and pass them through the hair sieve. 
Mince very finely a large bunch of curly parsley, so as to 
have at least a heaped up table-spoonful of it when minc- 
ed ; mince a dozen capers, and then mix the whole of the 
ingredients together with a wooden butter bat, and shape 
it as you like, setting it again in ice till wanted. There 
are numerous varieties of " green butter" : this recipe has, 
however, been proved to be a nice one, and will be found 
useful when anchovies in oil may happen to be unobtain- 
able.

For the sauce, make a sauce blonde with butter, and flour, 
moistened with the liquor from the fish ; when smooth, 
add a dessert-spoonful of finely minced capers, and off the 
fire, just as you serve, the yolks of two eggs, well mixed 
with some melted butter. Pour the sauce over the fillets. 
A few drops of any aromatic vinegar will improve this 
sauce. 

3. — Cover the breasts of two good-sized chickens with 
paper, and roast them without letting

the breast meat as neatly as you can, 
also the flesh of the thiijhs and drumsticks. Out of the 
pieces thus obtained, trim a number of neat fillets as nearly 
the same size as possible, dredge a little flour over them 
and cover them up. 

For chicken chaud-froid sauce : — Take all the bones left 
after the above operation, skin, necks, pinions, &c., and 
make a strong chicken broth with them, adding an onion, 
some celery, a carrot, a bunch of parsley, a few almonds, 
pepper, and salt, to flavour it well. When the broth is 
ready, strain it into a bowl, skim it, and proceed to make 
with it a rich veloute sauce, using for a pint of broth an 
ounce of butter and one of flour : strain it and let it get 
cold, and then add to its thickness by stirring into it one- 
third of its quantity of liquefied aspic, or plain strong meat 
jelly, and reducing it over the fire till it coats the spoon. 
Now take it from the fire, and add the yolks of three eggs, 
and (if available) a table-spoonful of thick cream. Pour 
some of this over the pieces of chicken completely coating 
each piece, as it were, Avith a thick white glaze. Put 



MENU FOR A PARTY OF EIGHT. 379 

them away so that the glaze may cool and set. Prepare 
a border of creme de topinambours (page 149) decorating 
the top of the mould with carrots and green peas : after 
steaming it, let the mould get cold, and then set it in ice. 
When quite cold, turn it out carefully upon a cold silver 
dish, fill the hollow in the centre with the pieces of glazed 
chicken, introducing a slice of truffle here and there as you 
arrange them, and garnishing the top of the chicken with 
cold boiled cock's comb, and truffles : let the dish remain 
in the ice-box until the time arrives for it to go to table. 

4. — The cutlets in this dish should be most delicately 

grilled, and served round a socle of 

Mutton cutlets with V^^^^^ mashed a la " G. C." (page 

Valois sauce. 131) the chief feature of the plat 

being the sauce. 

Boil a large sweet onion, cut up into dice, in a coffee- 
cupful of vinegar : let it boil till the vinegar is entirely 
reduced ; let the onion get cold, then pound it and mix into 
it an ounce of butter, and the yolks of five eggs. Stir this 
over a low fire for a couple of minutes only. Take it off, 
add another ounce of butter, mix it well, and re-place the 
sauce-pan on the fire, adding half a pint of chicken glaze 
(that left from No. 3 will do), and another ounce of butter ; 
mix thoroughly, adding finally a table-spoonful of chopped 
curled parsley ; pour this into the centre of your ring of 
cutlets, and serve. This sauce should be made early, and 
kept hot en hain-marie, for the moment the cutlets are 
cooked, they must be sent up, and the sauce will spoil if 
allowed to get cold.

colour nicely. Next put them in a stew-pan, cover them 
with a rich gravy, and stew them till they are done. Lift 
them out, thicken the gravy with butter and flour, colour 
it with caramel, add half a glass of Madeira, the livers of 
the birds pounded, a tea-spoonful of red currant jelly, a 
dash of chilli vinegar, and some finely minced mushrooms ; 
heat the quails up in this sauce, and serve as hot as possi- 
ble, dry toast accompanying.

and let it get cool. Now take an enamelled-pan and break 
into it the yolks of ten eggs, strain the made chocolate, 
and add it to the eggs, stirring continually over a low fire, 
or in the bain-marie until the custard thickens satisfac- 
torily. Mix half an ounce of dissolved gelatine into the 
custard, strain, and whip it well while w^arm and let it get 
cold. Set a mould in the ice-pail, and when the custard 
has cooled nicely, pour it into the mould, freeze in the 
usual way, using the spatula frequently, when the cus- 
tard seems nearly frozen, add a wine-glass of very cold 
syrup flavoured with vanilla, continue the working, and 
then pour in a> pint of well-whipped cream. Finish the 
freezing thoroughly, close the mould securely, and bury 
it in ice for a couple of hours. Then turn the parfait 
out on a napkin, and serve. 

If you are fortunate enough to be able to use cream 
instead of milk for the making of the chocolate in the 
first instance, the parfait will be all the nicer. 



jlfOTE. — To adapt this menu, serve the hen turkey after 
the fish, and let the quails be roasted and sent round with 
the usual accompaniments.

1. — Prepare your stock as usual but without colouring. 
Remove the flesh from a cold roast 
fowl, excluding all skin, and browned 
parts : add to the meat so obtained, half its bulk of bread- 
crumbs soaked in stock, and pound both together in a 
mortar, with twelve sweet, and thi^ee bitter almonds, and 
the hard-boiled yolks of four eggs. Mash and cast all the 
bones into as much uncoloured beef stock as you think 
you will require for eight basins, and let them simmer for 
two or three hours. Pass your pounded fowl and crumbs 
through the sieve to get rid of lumps, gristle, &c., moisten- 
ing it with a spoonful or so of stock to assist the operation. 



MENU FOR A PARTY OF EIGHT. 383 

When near the dinner hour, strain off your stock from the 
bones, and place it to get cool, removing all the fat that 
may rise to the surface. Now take a sauce-pan and melt 
an ounce of butter at the bottom of it, stirring in a table - 
spoonful of flour ; add a little stock, and work the paste 
so obtained without ceasing, gradually pouring in stock, 
and adding pounded fowl, until you have exhausted your 
supply. Let the puree now come to the boil ; remove the 
sauce-pan from the fire, and as you pour it into the tureen, 
stir into it a coffee-cupful of cream, (or that quantity of 
milk with which the strained yolk of an egg has been 
mixed) and serve. 

2. — Dress your fish in fillets, and bake them in a but- 
tered dish with a slice of tomato laid 
fasW^i'^*"' Venetian ^^^^ ^^^h of them, and a little chop- 
ped parsley and shallot, sprinkled over 
them. When done, arrange them upon a hot silver dish, 
and serve with the following green sauce : — Boil a little 
spinach, and when done, squeeze it through a piece of 
muslin : save the pulp you obtain for colouring. Now 
make some melted butter, assisted by a little fish stock 
made from the trimmings of the fillets and some vege- 
tables, with a spoonful of chablis or sauterne ; throw into 
it some finely minced parsley, a very little shallot, some 
chopped capers, and gherkins, and colour the whole with 
the spinach-greening. The white fish, the brilliant green 
sauce, and the scarlet slice of tomato with each portion, 
present a tasteful combination of colours, which might 
almost ''tempt the dying anchoret to eat." 

3. — Put a pound of the best table rice into a stew-pan 
with a quart of water, an onion, and 

with^'prawn's^' °^ '''^ ^"^^ °^^^®^ ^^ clarified suet. Simmer 
till the rice is soft, yet quite whole. 
Drain it, and pound it to a paste in a mortar with a table- 
spoonful of grated Parmesan, some butter, pepper and salt 



384 MENU FOR A PARTY OF EIGHT. 



Stir into this the yolks of three eggs, and powder it with 
a little spiced pepper. Pass all through the sieve, and 
pat it to a paste on your pastry slab, about one and a half 
inch thick. When quite cold, cut it into cylinders two 
inches long, and an inch and a half in diameter ; e^g and 
bread-crumb them, fry them, a golden yellow in butter, 
and let them get cold ; then cut off one end, and scoop out 
the interior of each cylinder ; fill it with a rich prawn 
salpicon well diluted with veloitte sauce : fix the end on 
again with white of egg. Heat in the oven and serve 
upon a napkin. 

N.B. — A casserole is literally a sauce, or stew-pan ; the 
term was originally given to cases made of rice or potato 
which were moulded on that pattern. 

4. — Roast six pigeons early in the day ; pick the meat 
from them, save the livers, and throw 
olivet" *"'"'^"""''^' all the bones into a small sauce-pan 
with some lean bacon, as much stock 
as you can spare (to the extent of half filling the sauce- 
pan) some whole pepper, a sliced carrot, a bunch of pars- 
ley, and a clove of garlic, a muslin bag containing some 
mixed .sweet herbs, and any scraps of raw meat you may 
have lying idle. With this make a strong gravy, by simmer- 
ing it slowly until almost half wasted : now strain the 
liquor from the various ingredients, and set it to get cool, 
^leanwhile, stone a couple of dozen French olives, and par- 
boil them, skim the fat that may have risen on the top of 
your sauce, and then add the olives chopped into dice. 
Let the sauce rest awhile. The meat of the pigeons 
should now be thoroughly pounded with half its bulk of 
bread-crumb, to a paste, the livers incorporated with it, and 
some fat bacon ; when you have worked this quite smooth, 
pass it through the sieve, season it with pepper and salt, 
and then fill six little buttered moulds with it, here and 
there slipping in a slice of truffle, and some pieces of 



MENU FOR A PARTY OF EIGHT. 385 

mushroom. Having your moulds tlius packed, you can 
set them in the hain-marie, and steam them gently till 
they are done ; turn them out, and serve with the olive 
sauce previously described, thickened, and brought to the 
boil at the last moment. 

5. — Remove the bone from a leg of mutton, fill its place 

with turkey stuffing, and tie the meat 

Braised leg of mut- • ^^^^ shape, set it in a stewing-pan with 
tou with vegetables. ^ ^ '^ ^ 

as much broth (made from the bone 

you cut out) as will half cover it : throw in a liqueur-glass 

of brandy, a couple of sliced onions, a carrot cut up, a 

bunch of mixed sweet herbs, or two dessert-spoonfuls of 

dried herbs, some whole peppers, a bunch of parsley, a 

clove of garlic, and one glass of port : set the pan on the 

fire, with some live coals on the lid as well : let this stew 

till done, very slowly, keeping it from absolutely boiling 

point, and when it is ready, strain off the sauce in which 

it has been cooked, thicken it, stirring in a table-spoonful 

of red currant jelly, half one of anchovy vinegar, and a 

glass of port : serve the mutton garnished with balls of 

turkey forcemeat (page 109) fried in butter, and pour the 

rich brown gravy round it. Let haricots verts and mashed 

potato accompany this dish. 

6. — Gently stew four partridges in stock with a carrot, an 

, . „ onion, a piece of celery, sweet herbs, 

Partridges in jelly. -, i i: ^,t j - ^ri. j 

and a glass oi Madeira. When done, 

set the birds to get cold and strain the gravy in which they 

were done. Now cut off the fillets of the partridges, and 

pick all the other meat from the bones as well. The fillets 

should be put aside. Simmer the skin, bones (pounded), 

and scraps, in the gravy again with a little red currant 

jelly and lime peel, strain, and reduce it to a glaze. Next, 

pound the meat you picked from the backs, and thighs, 

with the livers, &c., and with your glaze make a rich 

savoury paste of it. Prepare your aspic jelly slightly 



386 MENU FOR A PARTY OF EIGHT. 

flavoured with tarragon, decorate a plain mould with 
white of hard-boiled egg, slices of truffle and corniclwns, 
pour in a little jelly and set the garnish, then pack your 
mould with the fillets of partridge between layers of the 
paste and slices of truffle. Ice this, and present it with 
sauce ravigote (also iced) in a boat, and dry toast. 

^^ Aspic Jelly.'" — This requires attention; the common 
flavourless jelly, consolidated with isinglass, should be 
avoided if possible. In order to turn out an aspic, fit to 
present at a dinner party, you must proceed in this way : — 

Put into a stew-pan an ox-foot cleaned and cut up, with 
a bacon bone, or a slice or two of ham or bacon, any scraps 
of raiv meat, such as cutlet trimmings you may have, or, 
better far, a young fowl cut up as for fricassee, with a few 
mixed vegetables, &c., as for soup. Add a cup of cold 
water, cover the pan, set it on the fire, shaking it occasion- 
ally : when the pieces of meat begin to take colour, add a 
little more water, and in about half an hour, pour in 
enough water to cover the contents of the pan completely ; 
put in a tea-spoonful of caramel, and then let the vessel 
simmer for three hours very gently. When ready, strain 
the liquor off into a bowl, let it get cool, skim it carefully, 
add a tea-spoonful of sugar, and table-spoonful of tarragon 
vinegar, clarify it, (q. v. page 33) and strain it finally 
through a clean clotli, producing a clear, amber-coloured 
liquid, which will set of its own accord without isinglass, 
if put in the ice-box. 

A couple of calf's feet, or four sheep's feet may be used. 

7. — In wet weather excellent mushrooms are procurable

we have been fortunate enough to get a dish of a dozen 

nice ones, a very toothsome entremets can be made of them 

in this manner : — First, be careful in cleaning them ; cut 



MENU FOR A PARTY OF EIGHT, 387 

the stalks down, leaving only a little of them within the 
hollow of the mushroom, peel off the skin that covers the 
convex side of the fungus, brush away any particles of 
earth or sand that may adhere to the pink gills on the 
concave side, and by patting the top of each mushroom, 
shake out all grit. It is a very great mistake to wash a 
mushroom if you can possibly clean it in the way I have 
described. When satisfactorily prepared, clean the stalks 
you cut off, and chop them up. Put into a sauce-pan an 
ounce of butter and stir into it half an ounce of flour, when 
mixed, add half a pint of made gravy ; stir well and throw 
in the chopped stalks, a table-spoonful of chopped curled 
parsley, a tea-spoonful of minced onion, a salt-spoonful of 
salt, and a dusting of pepper : simmer the sauce until it is 
thick and rich, add a spoonful of cream, and then strain 
it. Now butter a silver dish liberally, place the mush- 
rooms upon it head downwards, fill their hollow parts 
with the thick sauce, and set the dish in the oven (a brisk 
one) for ten minutes. As soon as the mushrooms flatten 
themselves, as it were, they are done. Serve on the same 
dish wrapping a napkin round it. 

8. — This dish is not 'a difficult one. Choose a tin of 
American apricots, drain off their juice 
and place the fruit at the bottom of a 
glass dish ; add enough syrup to the juice of the fruit to 
cover them, pour into it a wine-glassful of noyeau or 
maraschino, and half an ounce of dissolved gelatine ; when 
cold, set the glass dish upon ice, and pour the syrup round 
the fruit by degrees, letting it congeal like jelly and 
embedding the fruit firmly. Leave the dish in the ice, 
and then make enough rich custard to form a layer an 
inch thick on the top of the congealed fruit, mix into the 
custard half an ounce of dissolved gelatine, and flavour it 
with vanilla : when quite cold, pour the custard by degrees 
over the layer of fruit ; it should consolidate also ; garnish 



388 MENU FOR A PARTY OF EIGHT. 

the surface of the custard with whipped cream in two 
colours, pink and white (the pink coloured with a drop or 
two of cochineal), and serve straight from the ice. 

9. — Gently boil a quarter of a pound of the best rice 
till about half done, then drain it and 
Jced rice a I'lmpeia- ^^^ ^^ ^^^^^ ^ stew-pan with a pint and 
a half of good boiling milk, and six 
ounces of sugar, add a coffee-cupful of boiling cream, stir 
well, and simmer till the rice is done. Let it get cold, 
Next mince up some mixed dessert fruits, greengages, 
cherries, apricots, &c., (preserved ginger, and citron if you 
like), moisten with a table-spoonful of maraschino or 
noyeau and put the mince away upon a plate. Now 
strain the milk and cream from the rice, add milk enough 
to fill the mould you have chosen, and turn it to a rich 
custard with eight eggs : next set the freezing pail in the 
ice, put the custard into it, and work it with the spatula 
till nearly frozen. You must now add the rice, with two 
whites of egg a la meringue, made in this way : — put two 
ounces of sugar into an enamelled sauce-pan, and heat 
it with a little water till nearly boiling, whip two whites 
of egg, and add them to the sugar, whipping all the 
time ; this, when cold, is what you want for the ice. 
Continue working the spatula, and when the mixture is 
all but frozen, add a coffee-cupful of whipped cream the 
minced fruit, and a liqueur-glass of liqueur ; stir well, 
freeze a little longer, then fill your ice mould, and bury it 
in ice until it is required. 



Note. — To adapt this menu, serve the leg of mutton 
after the fish, and instead of the aspic of partridges give 
poiilet an cresson with salade or roast game. A poulet, 
with really nice creamy bread sauce, and water-cress (if 



MENU FOR A PARTY OF EIGHT. 389 

the fowl be a plump home-fed one) , makes a very accept- 
able rot. 



Meringues. 

Put the whites of seven eggs into a bowl, and whip 
them as stiffly as possible, add half a pound of sugar, mix 
well, and with a spoon set portions of the mixture at inter- 
vals on sheets of buttered paper : each piece should be the 
size and shape of an egg : dredge some pounded sugar 
over them, and put them in the oven upon a baking-sheet. 
As soon as they assume a pale yellow tint, remove them 
from the oven, detach them from the paper, and cut them 
in halves with a very sharp knife. Scoop out the inside 
with a spoon as carefully as you can, and return them to 
a moderate oven to dry. After that you can fill the pieces 
with any nicely flavoured whipped cream, join tlic halves 
together with white of egg cement (page 357), and serve 
piled up upon a napkin.

1. — This soup, which is simply the ordinary mock-turtle 

not thickened, is to my mind the nicer 

Clear mock-turtle. ^^^,^ ^^ ^^^ ^^^ . ^^^^^^ ^^^^ however, 

so I shall describe both methods. First, for the clear :— 
Procure the stock meat as usual, and either half an ox- 
head unskinned, or a sheep's head (a calf's head is the 
proper thing, but we must deal with fact, not fiction, 
knowing that we cannot get veal here), well, — clean the 
head thoroughly, keeping the skin on, and scalding it to 
get rid of the hair or wool : remove every atom of brain? 
and wash the meat in several waters, set it to soak awhile 
in cold water, and then place it in your soup kettle ; 



MENU FOR A PARTY OF EIGHT. 391 

cover it with water and let it simmer slowly for an honr, 
skimming all fat, and scum that may rise : take it up (it 
will be about half done), remove the bones and set it, with 
a weight upon it, on a dish to flatten and get cold, Now 
throw your shin, &c., into the soup kettle, adding to the 
cold head liquor already there, the bones just removed, 
sufficient cold water to cover the bone and meat com- 
pletely and an ounce of salt. Proceed now as for consomme 
skimming very carefully, and retarding the boiling point 
as much as you can by periodical additions of water : 
when boiling takes place, ease off the fire, and add two 
Bombay onions in quarters, a head of celery, a couple of 
carrots, the rind of two limes, a large bunch of parsley, 
a quarter ounce of dried basil, (sold in bottles) a tea- 
spoonful of dried thyme, and of marjoram, (the herbs 
in a muslin bag) a dozen pepper corns, two anchovies 
cut up, half a wine-glass of mushroom ketchup, a table- 
spoonful of sugar, and a tea- spoonful of caramel. Simmer 
slowly now for about three hours, skimming the surface 
occasionally, and on no account permitting the vessel to 
boil. Now strain very carefully, and set the soup in a 
bowl to cool and throw up all grease. Cut the cold head 
into one-and-a-half -inch squares, skim the cool soup well, 
and pour it into a large sauce-pan adding the pieces of 
head. Let the pieces cook slowly for half an hour, then 
drain them, and again strain the soup : clarify it if neces- 
sary adding a glass of Madeira, and the juice of a lime. 
Let this be heated up finally when required, and pour the 
soup into the tureen over a dozen or so carefully selected 
pieces of the head arranged therein. Serve, with limes 
cut into quarters, which should be handed round followed 
by the Madeira. The hasil is most necessary, and the 
whole success of the soup depends upon strict attention to 
the flavouring herbs and ingredients. Select gelatinoua, 
not meaty pieces, for the garnish. 



391 MENU FOR A PARTY OF EIGHT. 

For the thick : — Go back to the period when you strain- 
ed the soup and set it to get cool. 

Thick mock-turtle. m i i i ij^ j^ 

lake a large sauce-pan, and melt at 
the bottom of it three ounces of good butter, mix into it 
three ounces of flour, when it looks nice and velvety, gently 
add the soup, stirring it in by cupfuls. Put into it the 
pieces of head, a glass of Maderra, and the juice of a lime. 
Let the soup come to the boil to thicken properly, and let 
it simmer slowly immediately afterwards, constantly stir- 
ring to prevent the meat sticking to the bottom of the pan. 
When ready (which you will decide by testing the meat) 
you can add a little more Madeira if you find it needed, 
and serve. 

Some people make small forcemeat balls of hard-boiled 
eggs pounded with some parsley, pepper, salt, spice, flour, 
and a raw ay^*^ ; or of chicken, with a little ham or tongue, 
savoury herbs, crumb of bread and eggs ; these they 
poach in gravy, and add to the soup when serving. I 
tliiiik however that the soup costs trouble enough without 
them, and, so many people misunderstand what they arc, 
iliat making forcemeat balls is often lost labour. 

2. — Choose a good deep cut of seer fish. Take about a 

pint of thin brown gravy, a little onion.

the skin from these pieces and put them aside. Break up 
the carcass, and throw it, with all fragments of skin and 
bone, and the giblets of the fowl previously saved, into a 
sauce-pan, with as much stock as will cover the whole ; 
add two onions, a clove of garlic, a carrot, sweet herbs, 
pepper, and salt, and simmer the contents of your pan as 
long as you can, finally adding half a glass of sherry, and 
bringing the broth to the boil. Now strain it, remove all 
fat that may rise, and reduce the sauce a little ; thicken it 
with butter and flour, take it off the fire, and stir in the 
yolks of two eggs beaten up with the juice of a lime. Let 
the sauce get cold. Next slice up four good sized truffles 
and toss the slices in a frying-pan in some melted butter, 
adding a liqiieur-glass of Madeira, and a little stock ; when 
the liquor boils, stop, and pour the contents of the pan 
into a bowl. / 

Make one or two very tliin pancakes, cut out of them 
eight pieces, five inches long and four wide, and put them 
aside. Now make the nicest mince you can of the cold 
fowl, diluting it with the cold sauce, and adding the liquor 
in which the truffles were cooked. Stir in a raw eg^ as it 
leaves the fire and let it get cold. Spread the pieces of 
pancake on a big dish and cover each of them with some 
very thinly sliced cooked bacon ; dot over the bacon the 
cooked truffles, on the centre of each lay a good table- 
spoonful of the mince, fold the pancakes over, fix them 
with white of egg, bread-crumb, and bake them a pale 
brown on a well buttered dish. Serve upon a napkin.

K.B. — Touching ragouts a la jinanciere and a la reine : 
the former is brown, the latter white. For jinanciere you 
must therefore use Espagnole, and for a la reine ^ bechamel. 
Oysters, chicken, rabbit, tongue, sweet-breads, liver, cocks- 
combs, truffles, mushrooms, and game, form the chief com- 
ponent parts of the plat. Select your ingredients ; trim 
the pieces of meat into small collops, and gently stew 
them ; that is, heat them up salmis fashion, in either the 
rich brown, or the delicate white sauce I have named ; the 
meat having been previously dressed, of course, requires 
no cooking. Bearing these general rules in mind, the 
ragouts will not be found very difficult.

For the haricots verts : — Remember not to allow your 
cook to cut the beans into the vermicelli-like strips you 
see so frequently. All that is necessary is to peel off the 
external fibre which runs round the outside edge of the 
pod, leaving the pods so peeled intact. Next choose a 
roomy, two-pound jam jar, or any vessel that you can 
close securely ; put the beans into it with a table-spoonful 
of good butter, a dessert-spoonful of sugar, and a salt- 
spoonful of salt. Cover the vessel tightly and steam it 
for an hour in boiling water. When done, drain the bean 
pods, and serve them in any of the ways mentioned at 
page 138. Steamed in this way the French bean of Indian 
growth tastes exactly like its parent as eaten in France.

melted maitre d'hotel butter, or, better still, a coffee- 
cupful of poulette sauce is an improvement just before o^

drain it very dry, and then moisten it 
with cream, adding a very little nut- 
meg : make eight houchees (miniature oyster patty shapes) 
of puff pastry, fill each bouchee with spinach puree, give 
them a cap of buttered egg (page 235), heat up in the 
oven, and serve on a napkin. 

8. — Make enough plain clear jelly, flavoured with any 
nice liqueur, to fill a pretty border 
C h a u d-f r 1 d of mould, and get ready a mixed collec- 
tion of dessert fruits, — a few of each 
sort, — such as greengages, apricots, cherries, strawberries, 
pears, &c., cut them into pieces, and garnish the mould as * 
tastefully as you can. When the garnish has set, complete 
the jelly with layers of the remaining fruit, and set it in 
ice. For the centre, to imitate a savoury cliaud-froid, you 
must make a breakfast-cupful of vanilla blanc-manger, 
dipping slices of preserved apples into it to counterfeit 
fillets of chicken masked in white sauce ; set them on ice 
for the blanc-manger to congeal, and then pack the centre 
of the jelly with them ; garnish the white fillets with 
slices of prunes to represent truffles, and a few plain 
slices of apple cut with fretted edges to imitate cocks- 
combs.

pails, and make a different ice in each 

^^^Iced pudaiug, med- ^^-j^ ^ -^ ._;^t^ j^ strawberry cream

these, and set your mould in the ice : when the four ices 
arc well frozen, mix them at hap-hazard l)y casting Uirgc 
spoonfuls of them one after the otlier into the mould : — 
say, first, half the vanilhi, then a (piarter of the chocolate, 
then half the strawberry, followed l)y a quarter of the 
pistachio, .some more chocolate and vanilla, and so on, till 
full. Work the spatula, and blend the colours without 
any fixed pattern, press the wliole togetlier firmly, freeze

To adapt this mcnu^ serve the fillet of beef after the 
lisli, and send up the plovers nicely roasted, with bread 
sauce, crisp potato chips, and a salad. A curl i.t ciisply 
fried bacon should accompany each I)ird. 



To make a vol-aii-veut case. 

^lake very carefully a pound of puff-paste, following tlic 
directions given at page 263. Give the paste six turns, 
and roll it out three-quarters of an inch thick. Cut out 
of this as neatly as possible an oval piece the size you wish 
your vol-au-vent to be. You will then have an oval piece 
of pastry three-quarters of an inch thick : turn it over 
upon a buttered baking-sheet, brush the surface and side 
with a beaten c^g, and mark out the interior oval, leaving 
an inch margin all round. Let the knife cut this tracing 
to a depth of a quarter of an inch. Now put the sheet in 
the oven, and when the paste is baked, remove the inner 
oval (for a cover) which you will find has risen . then 



MENU FOR A PARTY OF EIGHT. 397 

scoop out the uncooked paste inside the case : brush the 
whole case thus formed with egg again, and bake it for 
about five minutes. After this the pastry will be ready. 
Remember that in the first baking, the oval wall will have 
risen three or four inches high.

them, and let them get cold. Prepare some batter as 
follows :— Beat up together the yolks of two eggs (save 
the whites) with one table-spoonful of brandy, one of 
salad oil, and four or five table-spoonfuls of water. Amal- 
gamate with this three table-spoonfuls of imported flour, 
and a pinch of salt. Beat the mixture well for a minute 
or two, and bring it to the right consistency by adding 
water, or flour, as the case may require. When ready, add, 
at the last moment, the whites you saved, whipped to a 
froth : dip your collops into this, and lay them one by one 
in your frying basket, dipping it immediately into a deep 
saute-pan, filled with boiling fat ; as soon as they turn a 
nice deep yellow, lift them out, drain them on a sheet of 
blotting paper, and serve them, crisp and dry on a napkin 
garnished with fried parsley, and slices of lime. Witli

and put them aside covered up. Take all that remains,

trimmings, and, with an onion cut up, some pepper corns, 
a few spoonfuls of meat gravy, a bit of lime peel, a tea- 
spoonful of ketchup, and salt, make as good a pint of 
broth as you can; when ready, fish out the livers, and 
strain the broth. Now put into the stew-pan the selected 
joints of the chickens, cover them with the strained broth, 
and stew them gently till done, with one carrot, and a 
handful of French beans. Now pick out the chicken, 
strain the broth, and put the vegetables aside. Proceed 
with the broth to make a nice veloute (rich white sauce) 
flavoured with a dozen sweet almonds pounded, and a

of three eggs : when satisfactory, strain and put in the 
pieces of chicken, heating them without boiling. Cut the 
carrot, and French beans, with the livers you saved, into 
dice, and when you dish the chicken, garnish your entree 
with thera. A casserole of mashed potatoes, shaped like 
the pastry case of a vol-au-vent, and nicely ornamented, 
can hold the chicken, and the garnish should be sprinkled 
over the surface.

and spread it cvenl}- over the bacon, roll the meat care- 
fully up, and secure it in shape with tapes. Put four 
ounces of butter into a stew-pan, and turn the roll of 
mutton over in it till it takes colour. Now pour in a pint 
or so of good broth made from the bones and trimmings, 
with two Bombay onions cut up, a clove of garlic, a carrot 
sliced, six pepper corns, a blade of mace, a good piece 
of celery, a dessert-spoonful of sugar, a dessert-spoonful 
of salt, a tumbler of chablis or sauteme, and half a glass 
of brandy. Braise the mutton in this until it is done. 
Dish it on a hot dish, and brown its surface with a hot 
iron. Strain off the gi'avy, remove the fat, flavour it as 
for game with half a glass of Madeira, a dessert-spoonful 
of red currant jelly, the juice of a lime, and a few drops 
of chilli vinegar ; let it boil up, pour it round the mutton, 
and serve. Garnish the dish with small white onions (the 
size used for pickling) glazed, and send round jiotatoes ^

cold, cut out of them, with a vegetable scoop, a number of 
pieces the size of an olive ; cut some beetroot in the same 
way, and likewise some truffles. Take equal parts — say a 
cupful— of each of the above, and a similar quantity of 
fresh haricot beans ready cooked, and of asparagus points 
prepared in the same way. Two table-spoonfuls respec- 
tively of capers, of French pickled gherkins cut into the 
shape of capers, and of anchovies, perfectly cleaned, and 
cut into small pieces ; a couple of dozen or more olives 
stoned, one table-spoonful of parsley minced fine, and one

Sweet capsicums are a nice addition, not only for their 
flavoui', but on account of their brilliant colour.

1. — Make a strong clear consomme with beef, bone, 
vegetables and herbs, as usual : when 
done, strain it into a bowl to be ready 
when wanted. Pick enough cold boiled prawns to fill 
a half-pint pot to the brim : pound these in a mortar 
with a good allowance of butter till you get them to a pulp : 
flavour this with salt, and a little spiced pepper to taste : 
now melt an ounce of butter in a sauce-pan, and incorpo- 
rate therewith a table-spoonful of flour ; mix this with the 
prawn pulp. Next take about the same quantity of bread- 
crumb well soaked in stock (the consomme) that you have 
of prawn, and add it to the prawn pulp also, off the flre, 
mixing the two together by degrees thoroughly, and 
gradually adding the consomme till you find you have a 
soup a little less thick than that you want eventually to 
get. You now set the sauce-pan on the fire, and stir 



404 MENU FOR A DINNER OF SIX. 

vigorously till it boils, and tliickeus ; take it off the fire 
then, and let it get cool, to enable you to remove any fat 
that may rise, after which the puree should be pressed 
through a haii' sieve into a bowl. When wanted, it must, 
of course, be re-heated, and served with dice of fried bread. 
This soup is well worth the little trouble it requires : it 
is, of course, a relation of the Usque family. A coffee- 
cupful of boiling cream, or of milk in which the yolk of 
an egg has been whipped, may be added, but I think the 
puree is generally rich enough without that assistance. 

Let my np-country friends follow this recipe, using a 
tin of lobster, well drained, and washed : their efforts will 
result in " bisque de homanJ.'' In this case the coral of the 
lobster gives the soup a rich orange colour. The Ameri- 
can canned lobster, prawns, and shrimps, make excellent 
bisques. 

2. — Cut and trim tlircc nice wliitings in fillets, brush

boiling fat, drain, and serve them with this sauce : — Melt 
a dessert-spoonful of butter in a small sauce-pan, stir in a 
dessert-spoonful of flour, add half a pint of warm fish 
gravy, let it thicken, and finish it with the juice of a lime, 
a little salt, a pinch of sugar, a few drops of tabasco, and 
a heaped up dessert-spoonful of clioppcd capsicums. 

3. — Choose a first rate neck of mutton, divide it into tho 
neatest cutlets you can, give them a 
so.'JefauncT"'-''"'"' '!"«' of pepper and salt, and place 
them cii marinade for the rest of the 
day. For the sauce you want one iJombay onion, two 
handfuls of sorrel, one lettuce, and two table-spoonfuls 
of butter. Take a light sauce-pan, melt the butter at tho 
bottom of it ; throw into it the onion very finely shredded, 
toss this about till it tarns a pale yellow, and then add 



MENU FOR A DINNER OF SIX. 405 

the whole of the sorrel and the lettuce also finely cut up. 
Stir the vegetables about in the melted butter till they 
begin to change colour, and then pour into the sauce-pan 
about half a pint of gravy slightly thickened with flour ; 
stir this well, and put in a tea-spoonful of white sugar, 
three salt-spoonfuls of salt, and a good dusting of black 
pepper. Let the vegetables boil for about five minutes, 
then, if you find the sauce too thick, or as cooks say, 
" stodgy," dilute it with a little more gravy, till it assumes 
the consistency of a rich puree, ease the fire and let the 
sorrel simmer for half an hour. At the end of that time 
it will be ready to accompany your cutlets, which should 
be drained from their marinade, dipped in melted butter, 
and grilled over a bright clear fii^e. Prepare a circle of 
mashed potato, fill it with the puree burning hot, and 
arrange the cutlets round the outside of the circle, with 
bunches of water-cress for garnish. 

4. — A really tasty cold dish, garnished with blocks of 

broken aspic jelly, the whole fresh 
Galantine of capon. . ,7-1 i • i, 

from the ice-box, and accompanied by 

a good salad is, to my mind, a worthy 'piece de resistance 

for a little dinner party at Madras in the sultry month of 

May. A galantine too, is a dish that is well adapted for 

a Neilgherry picnic, the wedding breakfast, the luncheon, 

or supper, so let us discuss the following recipe : — 

Choose a very fine fowl, capon, or hen-turkey ; purchase 
one of Crosse and Blackwell's " picnic tongues" (in the 
round tins) and proceed as follows : — Having cleaned the 
bird, and having carefully saved the liver, heart, and 
gizzard, lay it breast downwards on a board, and proceed 
to bone it (Ramasamy does this generally very cleverly) 
you may sever the pinions, legs, and neck, but draw the 
skin carefully over the places, and stew them up, so that 
the outer skin may be as whole as possible. Cut off all 
the meat from the pinions and legs (removing the sinew) 

42 



406 MENU FOR A DIXXER OF SIX. 

and flatten the carcass before you with a cutlet bat. Make 
a forcemeat as follows : — five ounces stale bread-crumb, 
five ounces minced fat bacon, the rind of a lime minced 
fine, a dessert-spoonful each of thyme and marjoram, some 
spiced pepper, and salt, a table-spoonful of minced parsley, 
all bound with four eggs : mix this as previously describ- 
ed, and keep it by your side in a basin. Xow turn out the 
" picnic tongue," straighten it, and cut a solid piece of the 
best meaty part to form the centre of your galantine : 
it should be nearly as long as the carcass of the fowl 
(leaving room for folding up) and nearly the full thick- 
ness of the tongue after the skin has been peeled off. Slice 
up the remainder of the tongue ; separating fat slices from 
lean, and kecj) them on a dish handy ; scraps may be 
minced fine, and mixed with the forcemeat. To make the 
foundation of your work as level as possible, you should 
trim nearly all the meat of the carcass of the fowl, with a 
very sharp knife, almost to the skin ; the meat that is thus 
detached should be kept with that of the wings and legs. 
Lastly, mince together the liver, gizzard and heart, and 
" spice-pepper," and mince them well. 

First, spread a layer of the stuffing a quarter of an inch 
thick evenly over the fowl, upon that a la3'cr of your slices 
of tongue (spice-pepper freely) upon that a layer of the 
meat you cut from the fowl (dust of salt) over that a 
second spread of forcemeat, then your minced liver, &c., 
and lastly, the block of tongue : fold over this the flatten- 
ed carcass, disturbing the layers as little as possible, and 
sew the galantine up securely with fine twine. Envelop 
this in a clean cloth, and tie it up carefully with cross 
strings to preserve the oval shape of the galantine. Set 
this in a deep stew-pan, cover it well with weak stock in 
which a claret-glass of Madeira has been introduced, and 
simmer gently for three or four hours. When done, lift 
it out, drain it, take off the cloth, wrap it in a fresh dry 



MENU FOR A DINNER OF SIX. 407 

one, and place it on a dish with a heavy weight above it. 
When quite cold, take out your galantine, scrape off any 
fat that may be attached to the skin, glaze it, and set it 
in the ice-box, finally serving it garnished with broken 
lumps of aspic jelly. 

A galantine to be cot-red should, of course, contain a 
goodly allowance of truffles : these should be first cooked 
in butter and a little Madeira, and then introduced during 
the packing of the carcass, according to the artistic skill 
of the chef, in fairly large pieces ; truffle trimmings should 
be minced fine and added to the forcemeat. Little dice of 
cornichons are effective if dotted about in the layer of 
stuffing, and pistachio nuts are an improvement. 

5. — Let the teal be sent up most carefully roasted 

straight from the fire ; garnish each

wash them carefully, and when convinced that no earth re- 
mains hidden in the leaves, boil them in salt and water, 
or in milk if you can afford it. When tender, drain, split 
each piece in half, and serve as hot as possible upon a 
silver dish like asparagus. Butter plainly melted, as for 
" Dutch sauce," page 89, should alone accompany the 
vegetable thus delicately dressed. Please do not spoil it 
by serving it with a ' conjee' made of flour and milk, 
called by Ramasamy " white sauce," or with sodden toast 
beneath it.

cold, — not frozen as an iced pudding, 

but so long buried in ice as to be almost as cold. The 

cream is easy enough. Pass a pot of apricot jam through 

a fine sieve. Boil a pint and a half of milk ; mix into it 

when cool the yolks of ten eggs and make a rich custard. 

Stir into the custard when cool, an ounce and a half of 

dissolved gelatine, and then the strained jam. If not 

sweet enough, you must now add a little sugar. Set the 

liquid in a mould upon ice, and when you perceive that it 

is beginning to congeal, add half a pint of whipped cream, 

and a glass of noyeau. Stir the contents of the mould 

together, and then bury it in ice for at least two hours. 

Serve as cold as possible. 



Pickled steak, or chops. 

Place a steak in a deep dish with a couple of onions 
sliced, a clove of garlic, pepper corns, salt, some leaves of 
th3'me, and marjoram, a bunch of parsley, and some lime 
peel. Add oil and vinegar (two table-spoonfuls of former 
to one of latter) sufficient to soak the meat well without 
actually covering it. Let it soak all day ; lift it, when 
wanted, from the mariJiadey and fry lightly in butter: 
then (when coloured on both sides nicely) pour in the 
rnariJiade, with a breakfast-cup of made-gravy, and stew 
the steak gently till thoroughly done. — Strain the liquor, 
free it from fat, reduce it a little over the fire, pour over 
the steak, and serve. This is just as good with a nice 
mutton steak, or a few juicy chops.

oxtail, and when the shin consomme is ready early in the 
afternoon, (you should commence boiling the shin as soon 
as you can) separate the tail at the joints, and throw the 
pieces into your stock pot with two Bombay onions, two 
carrots, a stick of celery, and a muslin bag containing 
sweet herbs, parsley, a dozen pepper corns, and a clove 
of garlic ; add a wine-glass of mushroom ketchup, a tea- 
spoonful of caramel, and simmer the soup for a couple of 
hours skimming it carefully. If wanted clear, all that is 
now needed is to strain and clarify the liquor, saving a 
few joints of the tail as a garnish, a table-spoonful of 
Madeira with a squeeze of a lime, and a pinch of sugar 
being added to finish with.

If however you desire to serve a thick oxtail, go on in

soup, saving all the tail joints, and 

leave it in a bowl for a while. Pick all the meat from 
the tail, pound it in a mortar, pass the paste through the 
sieve, and then skim the fat off the bowl of soup. Take a 
roomy sauce-pan, melt an ounce of butter at the bottom 
of it, stir in a table-spoonful of flour, and gradually add 
soup and paste till all has been expended, let the puree 
come to the boil (by which time it will be thick enough) ; 
add a dessert-spoonful of red currant jelly, a tea-spoonful 
of anchovy vinegar, and a glass of Madeira, stir vigorously 
for a minute and serve. The common way of making this 
soup is simply to thicken the gravy, and to throw in the 
joints of the tail whole. I have tried ih.e puree, and con- 
sider the soup is vastly improved by the pounded meat, 
the flavour of the oxtail being far stronger. 

2. — "Bake the whitings very gently, and serve them with

the butter and flour have amalgamated, a breakfast-cup- 
ful of beef gravj, half a glass of sherry, a tea- spoonful of 
caramel, a table-spoonful of mushroom ketchup, one of 
Harvey, and one and a half of Anchovy sauce. Stir well, 
and pour piping hot into the centre of the potato ring. 

4. — This is a capital method of cooking a fowl, the pro- 
cess is simply that of steaming, so you 
cau mauner. ^ ^^^^' ^^^ want your fish kettle, and a pan, 
big enough to hold the fowl, with a 
close fitting lid. Truss the fowl : place a big Bombay 
onion inside the bird, with a couple of slices of bacon ; 
sew up the vent, pin a strip of bacon over the breast, and 
set the bird in the pan (without any water or gravy round 
it) carefully securing the lid with paste if necessary. 
Immerse the vessel containing the fowl in the fish kettle 
or any larger pan full of cold water, and set it to boil. 
Cook it slowly for upwards of an hour without removing 
the lid which should be scrupulously kept closed. In 
about an hour and a quarter (after the water came to the 
boil), you can take the fowl out, and place it at once on a 
hot dish well covered up. !N'ow strain off the gravy that 
you will find has been drawn from the fowl, and save it

peel of a lime, salt to taste, and, as the mixture boils, 
a table-spoonful of Harvey sauce : after it has come to the 
boil, strain the sauce carefully, add the oysters you saved, 
heat it up again : take it off the fire : pour in a coffee- 



412 MENU FOR A DINNER OF SIX. 

cupful of boiling cream (or milk in wliicli the yolk of an » 
egg has been stii'red, and heated up to the consistency of 
thin custard) and serve poui^ed over the fowl. Whilst this 
sauce is being made, it would be wise perhaps to leave the 
fowl in the vessel in which it was cooked, carefully cover- 
ed up and kept in the hot water bath. As soon as the 
sauce is ready, it can be dished up, upon a cradle of well 
boiled maccaroni. 

5. — This is a dish of " Bombay onions stuffed with 
kidneys," a most excellent savoury 
kiSfej^r ^^"^^'^ '''^^ ^''iremets if carefully done. Take six 
large Bombay onions : have ready ten 
sheep's kidneys, scalded, and skinned, but uncooked. Boil 
the onions till three parts done ; take them out, drain 
them ; slice off the top of each one (as you would treat an 
egg) and carefull}- remove the inside, leaving a hollow big 
enough to hold two small kidneys cut into eight pieces ; 
take two anchovies, pick out their spines and cut the fish 
into little squares : have some minced parsley handy, a 
lime, and some of the inside of the onion that you scooped 
out, minced and peppered ; put a lump of butter into the 
onion case first, then a little of the minced onion peppered, 
then your pieces of kidney, with little bits of anchovy here 
and there, and crown the top again with minced onion, 
and a pat of butter : a drop or so of lime juice should be 
given during the packing, and an occasional dust of spiced 
pepper. Now place the cap on again, and when the six 
onions are stuffed, lay them in a buttered baking dish, 
and bake in a slow oven for an hour. "When done, pour 
a brown sauce (separately made) over them and serve in 
their own dish.

Take a Madeira cake of a circular shape eight inches in 
diameter, cut it into nice slices the same shape as those 
you cut of pine-apple, lightly fry them in butter, then dust 
them over with powdered sugar and set them in the oven, 
spreading a layer of apricot jam over each slice. At the 
time of serving, drain the pine-apple slices, and arrange 
them with the slices of cake alternately upon a very hot 
dish, pouring the syrup over them. 

This receipt can be followed exactly with American 
canned pine-apple slices. If the taste of rum be objected 
to, try brandy or any nice liqueur. 



To make potato flour for souffles- 

Here is a recipe for potato flour which I do not think 
you will find in any cookery book. " The farina of the 
potato, properly granulated and dried, is frequently sold 
as a substitute for arrowroot," says an authority of note ; 
" it may easily be prepared at home, and will be found 
useful for making puddings easy of digestion for children 
and invalids." If kept dry, this flour keeps well for a 
long time. Choose some potatoes of a good mealy kind, 
peel and wash them (raw), and grate them to pulp with a 
strong bread grater, emptying the grated stuff into a large 
bowl of clean spring water : stir the potato and water to- 
gether briskly for a few minutes, and then let the former 
settle ; after resting ten minutes, strain off the water : 
repeat the process with another basinful of water, and let 
it rest after stirring for ten minutes, again straining off

414 MENU FOR A DINNER OF SIX. 

the water; and continue the washings, so to speak, until 
the water remains quite clear after the sediment has set- 
tled at the bottom of the bowl : about three changes of 
water generally suffice for this. When satisfied that the 
grated potato has been thoroughly cleansed, take it out of 
the bowl, drain it, and spread it out upon dishes to dry 
and bleach in the sun, turning it frequently. When quite 
dry, pound it in a mortar, and pass the flour so obtained 
througli a silk or hair sieve. Bottle it securely in dry 
bottles, and cork it down tightly. It will be white and 
quite flavourless.

and cut them up, breakmg all bones oi

as usual, and when you have obtained as strong a stock as 
possible therefrom, strain it, and let it get cool ; remove 
all fat that may rise to the surface, and when quite clear, 
pour it into a large sauce-pan, adding all the pieces of part- 
ridge, including the livers of the birds, &c. ; set this on the 
fire to come slowly to the boil, skimming it very carefully ; 
after it has boiled, slack off the fire, and let the contents 
of your sauce-pan simmer slowly for an hour or more. 
Now strain the soup from the bones, clarify (it should be 
a nice, bright, clear consomme remember) and give it half 
a glass of Madeira, a pinch of sugar, and a few drops of 
chilli vineofar to finish with.

Some people serve pieces of the birds' breasts with the 
soup, or quenelles made of that meat, seasoned, and formed 
about the size of olives. 

2. — Skin a couple of eels, clean, parboil, and divide them 

into two inch fillets for stewing. Put 
Stewed eels. . ex,, 

into your stew-pan two ounces or but- 
ter, with a Bombay onion sliced ; stir over the fire for five 
minutes, and add half a pint of claret, and half a pint of 
stock, with a clove of garlic, a carrot cut up, and a bag of 
sweet herbs : boil this for ten minutes, stirring it well 
with your wooden spoon ; now throw in a salt-spoonful of 
salt, a tea-spoonful of spiced pepper, the rind of a lime, and 
place the pieces of eel in the midst. Simmer this for half 
an hour. Arrange the pieces of the fish upon the hot dish, 
strain the gravy rapidly, thicken it, re-heat it almost to 
boiling point, add a pinch of sugar, and a table-spoonful 
of chopped parsley, and pour it round the fish.

plained for 'poulet a la St. Lambert.

the thick sauce, and let them get cold ; then bread-crumb 
them, and fry them a golden yellow in boiling fat. Drain 
them, and pile them on a napkin, garnished with small 
potato duchesses, and fried parsley. Send the rest of the 
sauce round in a boat after adding to it a heaped-up table- 
spoonful of minced mushrooms.

For onion 'puree a la Soubise, you must simmer three 
onions in sufficient stock or milk to cover them till tender, 
mash them, and pass them, through the sieve ; work into 
the pulp that you then get, a coffee-cupful of cream, or 
milk enriched with the yolk of an egg, with a little 
gravy ; flavour with a little pepper, and salt, heat it up 
as hot as possible, and serve. Its consistency ought to be 
that of thick custard ; no flour please. If the onions be 
jDcrmitted to brown, and the puree be served of that color, 
the sauce is called a la Bretonne. 

5. — The Jerusalem artichoke is one of the most useful 

vegetables we get. This is a very 

Jerusalem aiti- simple, yet tasty dish of them ; its 
chokes baked with . • , • 7 

ct^eese. correct name is topiiiambours au gra- 

tin : — Boil the artichokes till quite 
tender, then mash them with a silver fork, moistening 
them with cream, (or milk with the yolk of an Qgg), sea- 
son with salt and pepper, place the artichoke in a buttered 
pie-dish, or in buttered coquilles, give the surface a layer 
of grated cheese, and bake till it takes colour. Let the 
vegetable rest upon its own merits for flavour : you do not 
want spices, or sauces : the cream is, of course, a grand 
adjunct, and the cheese harmonizes pleasantly with the 
general tone of the composition. 

6. — Prepare six or eight neatly shaped slices of fried 

^ , , bread. Take from a tin of caviare 

Cavia.re toasts. t • . -, 

enough roe to cover each piece nicely. 

Choose a small sauce-pan, melt an ounce of butter in it, 

stir in the caviare, dust it well with Nepaul pepper, and 

add the juice of a lime. When piping hot, spread the 

caviare over the fried bread (which should have been kept 

in the oven) and send up the canapes without delay. 

Or, — spread the caviare cold over the cold fried bread, 

mask the surface with thick mayonnaise sauce, and garnish 

with a turned olive upon each. Many prefer this method.

7. — Steep an ounce of gelatine in cold water. Make a 

rich custard with ten yolks of esf^s, 
Orleans puddiug. ., i p ^ e ^ 

three-quarters oi a pound or sugar, 

and a quart of boiled milk. Add the gelatine to the 
custard while the latter is hot, and stir it until it is dis- 
solved ; then strain it into a bowl. Cut up one ounce of 
candied orange peel, one ounce of citron, one ounce of 
raisins, and one ounce of currants, wash them well, dry 
them, and then toss the minced confitures in a frying-pan 
with a small tumbler of rum : as soon as the rum is 
absorbed, stop and take the pan off the fire. Put a mould 
upon ice, pour a layer of custard into it first with some of 
the minced fruit ; when set, put a layer of crushed ratafias, 
then another layer of custard with fruit, again crushed 
ratafias, and so on till the mould is filled, cover it in ice 
and let it rest for an hour, then turn it out and serve. 

If cream be used instead of milk for the custard, a 
richer result may be obtained ; a good pudding is never- 
theless to be made with milk. 



Genoises au chocolat 

Genoise Pastry. — Take |lb. of the freshest butter, put 
it in a bowl, and warm it until it can be beaten with a 
spoon, add to it 4 oz, of powdered loaf sugar, and beat the 
two together until a smooth white cream is obtained, then 
add one egg, and keep on beating the mixture till it is 
smooth again, then add three more eggs in the same 
manner. The germ of the eggs should be removed. 
Lastly, incorporate quickly \Vo. of fine flour with the 
mixture, and as soon as it is smooth, pour it out to the 
thickness of Jin. on a buttered flat tin, which must be put 
into the oven at once. When done (in about ten to 
fifteen minutes), turn out the slab of Genoise, and put it 
to cool, underside uppermost, on a sieve. There is some 



MENU FOR A DINNER OF SIX. 419 

knack needed in beating this paste to prevent its curdling. 
Should this happen, it can be remedied by beating as 
quickly as possible until the mixtui^e is smooth again. 
Take a slab of Genoise, spread on the top of it the thinnest 
possible coating of apricot jam, then a coating of chocolate 
icing. Put it into a very hot oven for rather less than a 
minute, take it out, and place it in a cold place to get cool. 
Then cut it up with a sharp knife in any shapes you like. 

Chocolate Icing. — Put into a sauce-pan Jib. of powder- 
ed loaf sugar, 2 oz. of grated chocolate, a tea-spoonful of 
vanilla essence, and about a gill of water ; stir on the fire 
until the mixture assumes the consistence of a thick 
smooth cream. 



The following recipe I have to acknowledge with thanks 
from " Bahut Bursina": — 

" Beignets d'Avenches. — Take a new loaf and cut it 
into slices three quarters of an inch thick. Trim off all 
crust, cut into convenient slices, marinade in milk, or in 
cream if available, flavoured with your favourite essence. 
Take up the slices, drain them, and fry them in a deep 
bath of boiling fat, or butter, till a golden yellow : spread 
apricot or any nice preserve over them, and serve hot." 

It would be better perhaps to call the dish croutes a 
VAvenches, as by the word heignet we generally under- 
stand that the thing to be fried is dipped in batter.

a quart and a half of beef consomme made as usual from the 
shin, and add four glasses of portwine, or claret. When 
well incorporated, pom- this into the pan containing the 
pieces of hare, and let them stew in it very slowly till 
thoroughly done. Now drain off the liquor from the bones,

tlie hare was cooked to the stew-pan, set it on the fire, and 
let it throw up all grease, &c., in the form of scum, which 
skim off carefully. Now take a small sauce-pan, and mix 
therein the blood jou saved, and some of the soup from the 
st€w-pan : thoroughly amalgamate these (in the hain- 
viarie), and add the mixture slowly through the pointed 
tin strainer, to the gradually re-heating soup. Let it come 
nearly to the boil, and then serve it over the pieces of hare 
you preserved. This is Gouife's receipt simplified. There 
are other waj's of making hare soup especially that called 
'potaye a la puree de lievre, which are always popular. The 
puree is, of course, assisted with pounded meat, red currant 
jelly, lime juice, and plenty of port wine.

a bath of boiling fat. Drain them 

and serve with the following sauce in a boat, — fry a 
Bombay onion finely minced, with one clove of garlic also 
minced, in butter at the bottom of a sauce-pan ; when 
turning brown, put in a table-spoonful of choppexi parsley, 
a tea-spoonful of sugar, a coffee-cupful of vinegar, and a 
pint of beef gravy. A tea-spoonful of red currant jelly 
may next be stirred in, and a table-spoonful of mushroom 
ketchup. As soon as the mixture becomes nicely flavoured, 
and the juices of the various ingredients appear to be 
extracted, strain off the sauce. Now cut up a ta.ble-spoon- 
ful of minced cornichons, add the mince to the strained 
gravy, heat it up to concert pitch, and send it round with 
your fried fish in a boat.

422 MENU FOR A DINNER OF SIX. 

Save all bones, skin and scraps, and make a nice clear 
white broth with them. Take of the fowl meat two parts, 
of cold boiled tongue ane part, and of trnffles one part. 
Mince all very finely and mix them together. Melt au 
ounce of butter in a sauce-pan, stir into it a table-spoonful 
of flom-, moisten it with some stock, and then add the 
mince : flavour it with salt, pepper, and a little powdered 
thyme to taste, and stir it over the fire for three or four 
minutes : take it off the fire, and add two eggs beaten up 
with the juice of a lime and stiTiined. Spread the mince 
out upon a large dish (it should be pretty ^tiff) and let it 
get cold. Now divide it into six or eight egg-shaped 
croquettes, introduce in the centre of each a piece of truflBe 
the size of a shilling, bread-crumb them and fiy them a 
very light gold colour. Prepare a circle of mashed potato, 
place it neatly in the dish you intend for your entree, dis- 
pose the croquettes carefully round it, and between every 
croquette put a ci-ispy fried curl of bacon, while a slice of 
truffle may repose upon each of them. 

For the " asparagus points," you must cut off the green 
ends of the stalks of a tin of asparagus. Heat them 
gently up in veloute, made with the chicken broth you 
drew from the scraps, slightly flavoured with almond, and 
enriched with a good spoonful of cream ; give them a few 
drops of anchovy vinegar, and pour them into the middle 
of your potato circle,

Fricandeau of beef. ^ ° 

to suggest youi' trying one with beef, 

thus : — Get tico undercuts of the sirloin, if one be too small, 
trim them into a neat shape, and attach them together by 
two good skewers. Lard them freely with fat bacon. If 
you cannot lard, having no needle, you must introduce a 
slice of bacon into each fillet by making therein a longi- 
tudinal incision j slip into it your slice of bacon, and pin 



MENU FOR A DINNER OF SIX. 423 

the lips o£ the incised meat together with a small skewer. 
The fricandeau is now ready for the stew-pan, into which 
please put the trimmings of the meat, two ounces of carrot 
sliced, two ounces of onion sliced, a pinch of salt, a pinch 
of sugar, and a pinch of pepper : — place your fillets upon 
the vegetables, and pour into the pan half a pint of good 
gravy ; l^t this cook up to boiling point, and keep it on the 
fire till the broth has somewhat reduced and thickened : 
then add a pint more gravy, and let it simmer for an hour 
with the pan half covered. Now close your pan : put some 
live charcoal on the lid, which lift «very five minutes or so 
to admit of your basting the meat under it. Continue this 
until you have glazed the fricandeau^ then take it out, 
and dish it on a very hot dish. Quickly, strain the gravy 
from the stew-pan, skim off any grease there may be, pour 
it over the meat, and serve. Let a puree of sorrel, vide 
Menu No. XII, accompany the fricandeau^ potatoes a 
r Americaine, and petit pois verts. 

5. — A quail for each guest. These should be boned, 
stuffed with a little cooked bacon, 
and some turkey forcemeat (page 108) , 
then sewn up, rolled in little cloths, and gently sim- 
mered in broth. When done, let them cool, take off 
their cloths, let them get cold, and glaze them. Now 
set them on a dish which should be k«pt on ice, and serve 
them, garnished with olives farcies, and hand round iced

Beef Olives 

Cut thin slices of steak two inches wide by six inchc> 
long, put on each at one end a piece of Oxford, or Bologna 
sausage meat the size of a pigeon's Qg^ ; roll up each olive 
tightly and neatly, and tie it up with a piece of thread. 
Fry them in hot butter until they begin to take colour, 
then take them out, lemove the string from each olive, 
and lay them by. Fry some onions a gold colour in but- 
ter, add a very little flour, sweet herbs, a few mushroom 
trimmings, pepper and salt quant, suff., and moisten with 
some very good gravy or stock ; let the sauce boil, then 
strain it, and carefully lay the olives in it to simmer till 
done and ready to be served ; the sauce should cover them 
in the .sauce-pan. 

It will be observed that olives are not used in this dish 
at all. It is difficult to discover how the word was chosen 
to represent little rolls of meat containing sausage salpicon

mixed vegetables. Take six snipes, and lightly roast 
them : pick the whole of the meat from their breasts, and 
save it ; mash the bones that remain, and put them in a 
bowl w4th the trails. When the stock is quite ready, 
strain it, return it to the pot, and throw into it the bowl- 
ful of mashed snipe bones, two glasses of portwine, a 
dessert-spoonful of red currant jelly, and a dessert-spoon- 
ful of crystal-vinegar. Let the contents of the pot sim- 
mer slowly for an hour and half, skimming off any scum 
that may rise, and when you have thus extracted the 
essence of the snipe fragments, strain the liquor from the 



426 MENU FOR A DINNER OF SIX. 

bones, and set it in a bowl to cool. Now pass the snipe meat 
that you saved through the mincing machine, and pound 
it thoroughly to a paste, using a little of the soup to help 
that operation. When the pounded meat is ready, skim 
any fat that may have risen on the surface of your soup, 
take a roomy sauce-pan, pla<?e it on the fire, put a couple 
of ounces of butter into it, stir into the butter a table- 
spoonful of flour, work it to a smooth paste, and then add, 
by degrees both soup and snipe past€, keeping the spoon 
at work the whole time. When all is expended, let the 
puree reach the boil in order to thicken properly. At the 
last, add a glass of port, a tea-spoonful of red currant jelly, 
and the juice of a good lime. Now get your tureen ready, 
break a raw egg into a cup, saving the yolk carefully ; 
mix a little of the soup with the jolk, and when well 
mixed, pass it through a perforated strainer into the 
tureen. Lift the sauce-pan from the fire, and pour it over 
the strained egg. Serve. Additional richness would be 
obtained if you were to pour into the tureen with the 
soup, stirring as you did so, a coffee-cupful of boiling 
cream.

mushrooms. Mix the mince in a sance-pan with some 
rich velovAe, and bind it wnth a couple of eggs, let it get 
€old again, and divide it into six nice portions, just as 
you would for *' kramouskys." Now make a large pan- 
cake, or two small ones, and when not quite done, take 
them from the pan, spread them on a flat dish, and from 
them cut six pieces about four inches square. Place your 
salpicon portions in the centre of each, and wrap them

silver dish, egg them, bread-crumb them, pour some melt- 
ed butter over them, and bake until a nice golden brown ; 
serve in the same dish, laid upon a napkin. The pan- 
cakes should be nice and thin, and you should season 
your salpicon with " spiced pepper." " Butch sauce" (not 
Hollandaise you know) should accompany.

yellow in abundance of fat, and served round a hollow 

mould of " savoury rice,^^ with some maccaroni d V Ita- 

lienne in the hollow in the centre, a recipe for which will

very carefully made turkey stuffing as

a deep stew-pan upon a bed oi sliced 

bacon. Put a couple of sheep's trotters, cut into small

and a clove of garlic. Pour into the pan a good pint of 

gravy made from the giblets, trimmings, and any scraps 

you may have, with a wine-glassful of Madeira, and cook 

the bird gently with live coals on the stew-pan lid, as well 

as under the vessel, for about three hours, brown the 

larding on the breast by passing a red hot iron close to it, 

and serve. Strain the gravy, thicken it, add some minced 

truffles, and send it round in a boat. Potatoes and 

cauliflower accompanying.

5. — A small tin of Pate de foie gras will do for this little 

party. Cut a thick slice of fat bacon 
Mould of foie gnis. • , j- j r -i. -.i 

into dice, and try it with a seasoning 

of spiced pepper, some minced sliallot, parsley, and mar- 
joram : when the bacon is melted, add some finely minced 
liver (that of the foregoing turkey could be spared) fry it 
in the hot bacon, and then turn the contents of your saide- 
pan into a bowl to cool. Now break up the pate, pick out 
the truffles, and foie gras, and place them on one side ; 
pound the pate forcemeat, and the cooled liver and bacon, 
together with the crumb of a roll, soaked in a stock, say 
about a quarter the bulk of the meat, and pass this through 
the sieve : you have now three things : — the pounded force- 
meat and roll, ihc foie gras, and the truffles : choose a nice 
sized plain mould, butter it, and pack it with alternate 
layers of forcemeat, and foie gras, dotting the truffles in 
according to fancy : — when packed, steam the mould in 
your hain-marie for three-quarters of an hour ; let it get 
cold, turn it out, glaze, and ice it. Serve with dry toast. 

G. — One remark only here : — Please do not spoil your 

asparagus by pouring an indifferent 
Asparagus. i-i i . . ,, 

white sauce like thin " conjee over it. 
All you have to do is this : gently warm the asparagus in 
its own tin in the hain-marie-\)a.u (immersed in a bath of 
hot water) drain it from its liquor as soon as it is hot (if 
3-011 keep it longer it will be spoilt) and turn it carefully 
into a hot dish. Put a pat of fresh, or of the " Denmark" 
tinned butter on the top of it, give it a squeeze of a lime, 
and serve. A pat of maifre cVhotel or anchovy butter, may 
with advantage supply the place of plain butter. 

N.B. — For heaven's sake, no toast. 

V. — For the chocolate souffle take two ounces of chocolate, 

and grate it into half a pint of milk. 

Chocolate soufile. j i <• 1 ,. .,, ^

boil tlie milk so that the chocolate may become thoroughly 
dissolved : when this has been done, the flavoured milk 
should be thickened with two tea-spoonfuls of potato-flour, 
or corn-flour, then strained, and set to get cold. The 
yolks of four eggs and a glass of liqueur should then be 
beaten up with the cold batter, the whites of six eggs 
being added in the shape of a stiff froth just before 
baking. A proper souffle case or tin should be used to 
ensure success. 

Gateau Napolitain, 

Take of powdered lump sugar the weight of twelve eggs 
in their shells, and take half that weight of potato flour ; 
separate the whites from the yolks of the eggs, beat up 
the latter with the sugar, adding a few drops of essence of 
lemon. Whisk the whites to a stiff froth, mix the two to- 
gether, and incorporate with the mixture, quickly and 
effectually, the potato flour, beating it all the time with the 
egg whisk. Pour into a plain mould, buttered. Bake in 
a quick oven until done. When cold, cut the cake in 
horizontal slices half an inch thick. Spread half the slices 
of cake with apricot jam, and half with chocolate icing. 
Arrange the slices one over the other, so as to form the 
cake again. Trim the slices neatly, and ice the cake com- 
pletely over with chocolate icing. This must be done 
quickly, and the icing should be kept hot, for it soon sets.

When done, remove the paper very carefully and place the 
slice upon a dish made hot to receive it. Melt a dessert- 
spoonful of butter, add a dessert-spoonful of flour, a cupful 
of broth, and the vegetables, &c., in which the slice was 
cooked; boil this for three or four minutes, strain, and. 
pour it over the fish.

cut a slice into the breast, let the gravy run out for a 
moment, then add to it in the dish (tipped up) a tea- 
spoonful of salt, a salt-spoonful of Nepaul pepper, a tea- 
spoonful of mixed mustard, and a glass of portwine. Stir 
these ingredients into the gravy, baste the bird well with 
it, and go on with the carving. 

5. — If you sunmion up courage to try this homely dish, 

you will often oi-dcr it again. Buy 
^^ ^ >h 1'°™^*'*^'* enough young moringa pods to yield 

seeds enough to fill a little pie-dish. 
Boil them, and scrape out the seeds, and the tender flesh 
inside the pods, into a basin : stir into this a table-spoon- 
ful of cream, or a coffee-cupful of milk in which the yolks 
of two eggs have been well beaten ; season with salt and 
pepper, and add a few drops of anchovy essence ; pass 
this into a well buttered pie-dish, and grate over the sur- 
face a good layer of Parmesan or any nice mild dry cheese. 
Bake for a quarter of an hour, and serve. If you can bake 
and serve the mixture in silver coqm'Ue shells, — one for 
each guest, — the entremets will, of course, look nicer.

taste, and the yolks of eight eggs. 

Flavour it with any essence you like, strain it, and divide 

it into three basins ; colour the first a bright red with 

cochineal, the second green with spinach greening, and 

leave the third its original colour. Whip each separately 

to a froth. These operations must be done while the 

custard is still warm. Set according to the following 

process : — Lay a mould on ice, pour some of the red cream 

into it to the thickness of about an inch. When this is 

set, pour in a similar layer of the plain cream, and, 

when this is set, pour in a layer of the green cream. 

Go on pouring in layers in the same way until the mould 

is filled. When the cream is quite set. turn it out. and 



MENU FOR A DINNER OF SIX. 433 

serve. Care must be taken in pouring in each kind of 
cream to get every layer the same depth. This is best 
done by measuring with water how much liquid will go to 
make a layer of the required thickness, and then getting a 
cup which holds just that quantity, and using it to mea- 
sure the cream. 



Perdreaux aux choux- 

This delicious dish deserves the closest attention, for it 
is perhaps the best way of cooking Indian partridges : — 

Prepare four partridges as for boiling, with their legs 
tucked in : lard their breasts with bacon and put an onion 
inside each of them. Cut a nice cabbage into quarters, 
blanch them, and steep them in cold water for an hour. 
Now take a roomy stew-pan, line its bottom with two car- 
rots, and two large onions sliced in rings, a sprinkling of 
powdered herbs, and a dusting of salt, and pejDper. Put the 
partridges above this lining, inserting a quarter of cabbage 
between each bird, a slice of bacon here and there, and 
some slices of Bologna or Brunswick sausage. Moisten 
with sufficient well made gravy to cover the birds. Boil 
closely covered up, and then simmer for an hour and a 
half if the birds are tender. Dish with the cabbage in 
the centre, and the birds placed neatly round it, with the 
sliced sausage and bacon as garnish. Serve the gravy in 
a boat.

flavoured with a few vegetables. Make a melted butter 
sauce diluted with the broth in which your fillets were 
boiled, and add to it a table-spoonful of finely minced 
parsley, and a tea-spoonful of tarragon vinegar : an onion 
should be boiled in the water with the fillets, and jDressed 
into the sauce through the sieve. 

3. — Choose six or eight nice rolls that have been baked 

in small round tins ; scoop out the 

Bread cases with crumb, and make hollow cases of them,

then fry them a golden yellow in 

butter. Open a small tin oi jpdte de foie gras, and make a 

cupful of thick Espagnole sauce (brown gravy). Proceed 

to pack your cases in this way : — first butter them, then 

fill them neatly with foie gras, pouring some gravy round 

the layers to moisten them, put a curl of crisply fried 

bacon on the top of each croustade, bake them till quite 

hot, and dish upon a napkin. 

4. — Prepare a well fed capon as if for boiling, cutting 
off all superfluous bones, the pinions, 

with the heart, gizzard, and liver (the 
giblets), throw into as much water as will cover them ; 
adding a carrot and an onion sliced, and some whole pep- 
pers. Whilst this is producing a broth, stuff, and lard the 
capon with strips of fat bacon, and fill the cavity of its 
carcass with a couple of sweet onions. When your broth 
is ready, choose a deep stew-pan, and place the bird therein, 
with a carrot cut into slices, celery leaves and stalks, two 
onions, pepper corns, a bunch of parsley, some dried thyme 
in a muslin bag, and a glass of sherry. Braise the bird 
in this till done : — Meanwhile pound the liver you boiled 
in the broth, and get ready some tomato pulp (say) a tea- 
cupful. Lift out the capon, and dish it upon some previ-

was braised, thicken it, add the liver, and tomato pulp, 
give it a rapid boil up, and pour it over the bird. The

1. — In a previous Menu I gave jou a recipe for a hare 

soup, simplified from Gouffe. There 

Hare soup, (Puree.) , , ., i • i i • -, 

IS, however, another and a richer kind 

of soup, with which the pounded meat of the hare is in- 
corporated, which has many devoted admirers. It is 
composed in the following way : — Make your ordinary 
amount of stock from a shin and a half of beef. As the 
stock is being made, clean, and cut up the hare, saving 
the blood. Let the pieces soak for half an hour, or so, in 
cold water. When the beef gravy is ready, put the pieces 
of hare into a large stew-pan with a bacon, or ham bone, 
or a few lean slices of either, an anchovy, three Bombay 
onions cut into quarters, three carrots sliced, a bag con- 
taining a dessert-spoonful each of marjoram, thyme, and 
parsley, the rind of two limes, and a dozen pepper corns, 

46 



433 MENU FOR A PARTY OF SIX. 

and cover the Tvhole with the stock. Let this simmer 
very gently for three hours, after it has once slowly 
attained boiling point. At the end of that time, strain 
the liquor from the meat, &c., and set it to get cool. Pick 
the meat out, and lay the pieces on a large dish. Choose 
the back fillets, pick the meat from the bones, and pound 
it to a paste in a mortar, moistening it with a little soup 
to assist the operation ; as soon as you have got the meat 
satisfactorily pounded, work it through the sieve, and 
save the pulp that you get carefully. Now take another 
stew pan, place it on the fire, melt a couple of ounces of 
butter in it, and work into it a good table-spoonful of 
flour ; when you have got a nice paste, add a little soup 
with which the blood has been mixed, continue stirring, 
and, with the aid of an assistant, go on adding soup, and 
pounded meat, till you have exhausted the whole, stirring 
without ceasing ; now add half a pint of portwine, a 
table-spoonful of red currant jelly, and a table-spoonful of 
crystal vinegar, or lime juice. Let the soup come to the 
boil, so as to thicken properly, and become thoroughly 
blended. It can then be served. 

2. — Boil the fish, and serve it with this sauce : — Put 
into a sauce-pan a coffee-cupful of the 

clove of garlic, and a table-spoonful of 
mushrooms, all finely chopped up ; when this has been on 
the fire a few minutes, add a table-spoonful of flour, stir 
it well, and pour in a glass of chablis, sauterne, or hock, 
with half a pint of gravy ; add a dessert- spoonful of finely 
minced thyme, marjoram, parsley, and lime peel, all mixed 
together, a pinch of sugar, with salt and pepper to taste : 
let the sauce simmer slowly for half an hour, then strain 
and serve. This can be got ready early in the day, and 
kept hot in the hain-marie or re-heated when the time 
comes for its service.

3. — This I would serve within a casserole of ' savoury 

_, .^ n P , ^ice' garnished with cui-ls of crisply 

Blanquette of fowl. » . t , , , , „ ^/ 

tried bacon, and bunches of curly 

parsley. For the blanquette : — slightly roast a well fed 
fowl, covering the breast with buttered paper to prevent 
its burning : when done, put it on a dish, and let it get 
cold. Then carve it neatly, cutting the white meat off in 
nice little round fillets, and saving the wings, merry- 
thought, &c. Take the bones, skin, giblets, (previously 
saved) trimmings, and coarser meat of the drumsticks, 
and beat them well with your pestle. Next throw them 
into a sauce-pan, with as much clear stock as will cover 
them, a glass of sherry, and the usual proportion of vege- 
tables, especially celery, a bag of savoury herbs, lime peel, 
and a pinch of sugar. Make with this an excellent fowl 
consomme, an essence as it were, adding six pounded sweet, 
and one bitter almond. When quite ready, strain it off, 
and thicken it as for veloute. Then having got a rich, 
creamy, delicately flavoured, white sauce, put into it all 
your pieces of fowl, with some pellets of tongue cut like 
gun wads rather thickly, some sweetbreads (if you can get 
them), some button mushrooms, a few oysters trimmed 
free from their beards, a few slices of truffle, the liver of 
the fowl minced, and some grated lean bacon or ham. 
Gently, — ever so gently mind, — heat up the hlanquette, 
and let it simmer for half an hour over a low fire ; the 
various flavours will thus be extracted, and your plat he 
ready to serve whenever you want it. A table-spoonful of 
cream, or the yolks of two raw eggs beaten in a cup with 
a little of the sauce should be added, and stirred well in 
as a finishing touch. 

4. — Bone the loin, introduce a number of slices of bacon 

under the flap, fill the inside with a 

to?Tuffid!° *^^ '"^^' forcemeat made with the meat of the 

undercut chopped up small, with the

kidney (scalded first), and some of the nicest fat, seasoned 
with herbs, spiced pepper, chopped bacon, a little onion, 
and any mushroom, or trufile parinsrs you may have been 
able to spare from the hlanquette. Bind the salpicon vriih. 
four eggs, and spread it thickly over the inside of the bon- 
ed loin, then roll the joint up, and tie it firmly into shape, 
— do not skewer it. Now braise the loin in a gravy made 
from its own bones and trimmings, with a glass of Ma- 
deira, a clove of garlic, and scraps of vegetables of all 
kinds arranged round it. When done, and nicely browned, 
lift up the loin, remove the string, and dish it on a layer 
of boiled maccaroni. Strain off the gravy, throw away 
the garlic, and pass all the vegetables through the sieve ; 
thicken the gravy, add the vegetable pulp, and when 
thoroughly incorporated, pour it round the loin and 
serve. 

5. — A snipe for each head. Begin by roasting the snipes 

_ , , . liefhtly, then cut off the meat of the 

Tuibauof enipea. , , , • n,i -»c i i 

breasts whole in nllets. Mash the 

rest, trails and all, and throw the debris into a large sauce- 
pan with a pint and a half of well made beef gravy, an 
onion cut up, a stick of celery, a carrot, sweet herbs in a 
bag, a clove of garlic, salt to taste, a tea-spoonful of sugar, 
and the peel of a lime. Simmer as soon as the contents of 
the sauce-pan have come to the boil, for an hour or more, 
and get the essence out of the snipe bones. When that 
has been done, strain off your gravy, and set it to get cool . 
Pick all the snipe meat from the bones of the thighs and 
back, with the livers, (tc, and pound the whole with half 
its bulk of bread (soaked in stock) in a mortar, add the 
pounded meat of a lightly roasted chicken with its liver, 
and mix them thoroughly with two raw eggs ; season the 
mixture with spiced pepper, and dilute it with some of 
the gravy ; when worked sufficiently, put it into a border 
mould, and steam it gently. Turn it out when done, 



MENU FOR A PARTY OF SIX. 441 

garnish the top of the turban with the snipe heads and 
beaks, and with a fillet (heated separately in the gravy,) 
between each head and serve piping hot. The centre of 
the mould may contain the contents of a tin of black 
Leicestershire mushrooms, also heated in the gravy. The 
gravy itself should be treated thus : — After it has cooled, 
and you have skimmed it, place a sauce-pan on the fire, 
with a table-spoonful of butter at the bottom of it ; work 
into the melted butter a dessert-spoonful of flour, and 
then add your cool gravy, stirring all the time ; get an 
assistant to pour in a glass of portwine, a dessert-spoonful 
of vinegar, or lime juice, and a dessert-spoonful of red cur- 
rant jelly ; amalgamate the whole thoroughly, heat up 
the fillets, and heads in it, and the mushrooms strained 
from their own gravy. Garnish the turban quickly, as 
above described, and put the mushrooms inside the mould, 
pour the gravy over the whole composition, and serve. 

6. — Choose half a dozen tender cobs of Indian corn. 
The cobs should be still greenish 
Am^icanwly." "' otherwise they will be too tough. 
Boil them, and then, with a silver 
fork, strip the corn from the cob. When wanted for the 
table, melt a large pat of fresh butter at the bottom of a 
sauce-pan, empty the corn into the pan, stir it about add- 
ing butter, pepper and salt, till it is smoking hot ; then 
serve. 

7. — Mix together in a sauce-pan four ounces of floui', and 
an ounce of fresh butter, add a coffee-

with a few drops of lemon essence. Stir the whole mix-

let it boil. When well mixed and hot, place the batter on 
one side to get cool. As serving time approaches, break 
four eggs into a bowl separating the yolks from the whites ; 
beat the former, and whisk the latter to a froth. Add the 
jolks to the cool batter, stir thoroughly and at the last add 
the whisked whites. Prepare a deep bath of boiling fat, set 
your frying basket therein, and drop the batter into it, by 
dessert-spoonfuls at a time. Each spoonful will form it- 
self into a ball and turn gradually a golden yellow. When 
they are all done, drain and serve them in a napkin, dust- 
ed over with well powdered sugar, and this sauce in a 
boat : — Make a nice syrup (not too thick) with white 
sugar and water, stir in a glass of brandy or Madeira, 
give it the juice of a lime, and serve hot.

and the yolks of eight eggs well together with an egg

creamy appearance. Sprinkle in (beating the mixture all 

the time) half the potato flour, and add the whites of four 

eggs whisked to a stiff froth. Then put in, in the same 

manner, the rest of the flour, the remaining four whites 

beaten to a froth, and lastly the pistachio nuts pounded 

to a paste in a mortar. Bake in a slow oven. Meanwhile 

put the whites of two eggs into a basin with a little lime

it quickly with strips of citron and preserved cherries, 
and put it aside to get cold. 



Chaud-froid a la belle alliance. 

This is a slight departure from the ordinary school of 
chaud-f voids. Take as many cold foiids d'articliauts as you 
have guests — either fresh /o?zc?s or those preserved in tins. 
Lightly roast a tender fowl, and cut from it when cold as 
many nice fillets as you have fonds, shaping them so as to 
fit the tops of the latter. Make a pu7'ee with the scraps of 
meat left after trimming the fillets, associating with it 
some pounded mushroom. From a cold boiled tongue cut 
as many round slices as you have fillets. Make a good 
veloute with the bones, skin, &c., assisted by a little fresh 
meat, and reduce as already explained for chaud-froid 
sauce. !N'ow moisten the puree with a little sauce, and fill 
the cavities of the fonds; over that put the slices of 
tongue, some more puree, and then the fillets. Mask the 
whole with the thick chaud-froid sauce, let them get cold, 
trim them neatly, set them on a napkin, and garnish each 
with a piece of truffle. If carefully made, this makes a 
nice entree.

for stock as usual for a clear soup, you should take four 

good-sized caii'ots, -wash them well, and cut out of them a

®gg> or a little smaller. When you have cut a couple of 

dozen such pieces, throw all the scraps and trimmings of 

the carrots into the stock pot, to flavour the soup well. 

Shortly before serving time, you must cook the trimmed 

carrots in this way : — Melt a table-spoonful of butter in a 

frying-pan, put into it the carrot pieces, which should have 

been all but boiled till soft in the soup, and toss thera about

over the fire adding a salt-spoonful of powdered sugar, 

with a dusting of pepper and of salt, and moistening 

the pan with a spoonful of stock as the butter is absorb^ 

ed ; when done, the pieces of carrot will be almost glazed. 

All you have then to do, — your consomme having been 

strained, clarified and prepared for serving, — is to put 

the glazed carrots into the tureen, and pour the soup over 

them. 

2. — Fillet a couple of nice soles, brush the fillets over on

broth made from their own bones and trimmings, assisted 

by a spoonful of chablis or sauterne, and a coffee-cupful 

of stock. When done (which you can find out by testing 

them with a pointed skewer) place the fillets on a hot 

dish and cover them up. 

For the sauce : — Fry a couple of finely minced onions 

in butter till they assume a golden tint, stir into this, by 

degrees, a coffee-cupful of the gravy in which the fillets 

were cooked. When boiling, sharpen this by adding a 

spoonful of vinegar, then strain and pour it into another 

sauce-pan (by degrees) in which some good sauce blanche 

has been made ; mix thoroughly over the fire, and serve 

round the fillets.

wise, flatten them with a bat, trim them neatly, lard them 
with bacon, and lay them upon a butteretl tin in the oven

them under a weight, and when quite cold and firm, dip 
them into some melted buttei- or sweet salad oil, and roll 
them in a mixture of bread-crumbs, and gi-ated mild cheese, 
in equal proportions, dust over them some spiced pep- 
per, and a little salt and let them i*est to set thoroughly. 
Next dip them carefully in a soup plate containing an eg^ 
beaten up, and then roll them in veiy fine bread-crumbs. 
They may be left now till wanted. When that time comes, 
they must be fned in abundance of fat, and served, a

juice, sliced onion, and sweet herbs, then to grill them 
over a bright clear fire, and to send them up piping hot, 
and full of juice straight from the gridiron. Early in the 
day, when I trimmed the breasts, I would throw every 
atom of the backs, legs, giblets, &c., into a sauce-pan with 
the usual concomitants of gravy making, and distil their 
essence by gentle simmering. This I would strain when 
done. I would then pick all the meat from the fragments, 
pound it a la ptirSe^ and add it, with butter and flour thick- 
ening, to the gravy of the bones, judiciously introducing a 
tea-spoonful of red currant jelly, a dessert-spoonful of lime 
juice, some caramel colouring and a glass of red wine, or 
Madeira, with a few drops of ' tabasco' or chilli vinegar to 
finish with. This sauce I would send round in a boat, as 
hot as possible, following the grilled breasts.

Potted prawns. 

Potted prawns, home-made, ought to be oftener seen at 
Madras, than they are. Whether eaten with cheese, 
spread on toast, or at office in the form of a sandwich, 
this preparation is most acceptable. Select some nice 
sized prawns, boil them, pick out very carefully all the 
grit, and that black line which runs straight down the 
back and underneath every prawn : wash them afterwards 
in cold water, and pour a lot of water over them as they 
lie on the top of your sieve. When satisfied that you have 
thoroughly cleaned them, dry them, and toss them in a little 
melted butter in a frying-pan until they have absorbed the 
butter ; next pass through the mincing machine ; pound 
them thoroughly in the mortar, and lastly press them 
through the wire sieve. Season the paste so obtained 
with salt, white and red pepper, a few drops of anchovy 
sauce, a little pounded mace, and work the whole together 
with some nice freshly made butter till thoroughly incorpo-

Fritot de volaille- 

This simple dish should be noted : — 

Cut up a well grown chicken as if for fricassee : marinade 
the pieces in salad oil with the juice of a lime, an onion 
sliced in rings, pepper and salt. Half an hour before 
serving, take out the onion, and wipe the pieces of chicken 
on a cloth, then dip them in milk, flour them well, and fry- 
in plenty of hot fat accelerating the heat during the pro- 
cess. When the pieces are cooked, having been fried a 
golden yellow colour, pile them on a napkin garnished 
with crisply fried parsley. A nice sauce should accompany 
in a boat, bread sauce, poivrade, or Robert. 



Nouilles. 

Take half a pound of sifted flour ; put in on the paste 
board ; make a hole in the centre of the flour ; break three 
eggs in it ; add half an ounce of butter, and a pinch of 
salt ; mix all into a nice smooth paste. Roll the paste 
out very thin, say about the sixteenth of an inch, let it 
dry, then cut it into ribbons an inch and a half broad ; 
put five of these ribbons above one another, sprinkling a 
little flour between each ; then with a knife cut through 
them crosswise, making thin shreds like vermicelli ; 
shake them in a cloth with a little flour to prevent them 
adhering to one another, then throw them into two quarts 
of boiling water for six minutes. Use nouilles exactly 
as you would maccaroni.

1. — This is an especially favourite soup with those who 
Jerusalem artichoke ^^® fond of the flavoiu' of the Jerusalem 
soup- artichoke. 

There are two methods of composing it : to wit, mi 
maigre (with milk) and au gras (with stock) : I take the 
latter as the commoner form. Having washed, peeled, 
and boiled a nice dish of artichokes, pass them through 
the sieve ; save the pulp so obtained, until your daily 
allowance of soup meat has yielded sufficient nice clear 
stock for the puree. Now proceed to amalgamate the 
two in the proper way, by melting an ounce of butter at 
the bottom of a sauce-pan first, incorporating therewith a 
dessert-spoonful of flour, and after that has been done, 
stock, and pulp of artichoke by degrees until you have

while, and when the 'puree comes to the boil, it will be 
ready to serve. On its way to the table, like all purees, 
it may be enriched by a table- spoonful of cream, or a little 
fresh milk into which the yolk of an eg^ has been stirred, 
but the addition is not essential. An old fowl makes a 
good stock for this soup, if assisted by a slice or two, or a 
bone, of bacon, or ham. Fried croutons of bread should be 
handed round with it. 

Let those who rejoice in a dairy try the recipe au maigre 
thus : — Take as much milk as you want soup, and boil in 
it twenty pepper corns, some parsley, and a sweet onion. 
When thoroughly flavoured, sti^in the milk, mingle the 
pulp of the artichoke with it, as descHbed for stock, and 
finish it off in the same manner : the cream must be 
added in this case. 

2. — Choose two or three small dinner rolls which have

and fry the cases so obtained a golden yellow colour in

prawns to fill them, cut them into quarter inch pieces, 
toss them in melted butter, with a little mace, pepper and 
salt ; fill your cases, moistening the salpicon with a little 
white sauce, shake a little bread-crumb over the surface 
of each, place them on a buttered baking tin, and heat 
them for five minutes in the oven, serve as soon as the 
tops take colour. This recipe can be followed, substitut- 
ing canned prawn.«, shrimps, or lobster.

slice of lean bacon, an onion cut into quarters, a few pepper 
corns, and a seasoning of salt and pepper : when you have 
got a broth to your mind, simmer the partridges therein 
until perfectly tender. When done, (they will take three- 
quarters of an hour) take them out, and drain them, 
replacing them in the hot pan in which they were done, 
with the cover on. N'ow strain the liquor in which the 
birds have been cooked, and with it make a rich souhise 
sauce as follows : — Simmer four large Bombay onions in 
milk till tender, drain them, chop them up very fine, pass 
them through the sieve, and proceed with melted butter, 
and the stock aforesaid, to make a rich puree ; when boiling 
hot, dish the birds, pour the onion puree over them, and 
serve, garnished with curls of crisply fried bacon. The 
onions should, of course, be prepared beforehand to prevent 
delay : the yuree ought not to occupy more than ten 
minutes in preparation. A spoonful of cream should be 
added to it if possible. 

4. — Butter a little pie-dish well, strew a good layer of

layer of cheese over the surface, bake for about seven 
m.inutes (till the surface slightly colours) and serve. The 
eggs ought not to be done hard : the dish is not a pudding, 
but eggs, just set, in a creamy sauce with a little delicate 
cheese flavouring. Some people call this dish " (Eufs a

crumbs, four ounces of dry, finely minced suet, a pinch 
of salt, three ounces of crushed ratafias, three ounces 
of candied peel sliced thin, and a few drops of lemon 
essence. Next whisk five eggs well, with four ounces of 
sugar, continue to beat them together until the sugar is 
dissolved, then pour them into the basin with the other 
ingredients, and mix well ; turn all into a buttered basin, 
and boil for two hours. This will be enough for a quart 
basin or mould ; half of everything will be sufficient for 
the home dinner. 

Sauce a la Careme may accompany the pudding, made 
in this way. Beat the yolks of three eggs with two 
ounces of sugar and a claret-glassful of Madeira, when Avell 
mixed, set the sauce in the hain-marie and let it thicken 
like a custard. When smooth and creamy, serve it in a 
boat, hot. This is a good sauce with any pudding. You 
can use Marsala instead of Madeira just as effectively. 



Vanilla cream ice- 

This is a simple recipe for a delicious ice that will not 
be found expensive. Mix the yolks of eight eggs well 
with a pint of fresh milk, strain it, sweeten it to taste, 
flavour it with vanilla, and set it in a sauce-pan in your 
hain-marie to thicken. When you have got a nice thick 
custard, whip it well, let it get cold, pour it into your ice 
pot and freeze it. It will turn out rich and creamy, not a 
bit like the milk-and-water ices that one so often mourns 
over. 

A coffee-cupful of whipped cream may be added, if a 
superlatively nice ice be required ; wait until the custard 
has nearly frozen, then stir the cream in, and work it well 
for a minute or two. Half an ounce of gelatine dissolved 
and added to the custard, and two ounces of chopped apri-

Open a tin of lobster : choose all the larger pieces for 
the dish you are going to make, and put all the mashed 
fragments aside to be used in bouchees or croquettes for 
some other meal. Having washed and drained the firm 
pieces aforesaid, dry them, and cut them up into quarter 
inch collops, and pile them in the centre of a dish that will 
stand the oven. N'ow cut up a good sized Bombay onion, 
fry it in an ounce of butter, adding off the fire a sherry 
glass of chablis or sauterne : when the onion seems cooked, 
stir in a breakfast-cupful of rich thick brown sauce, and 
the same quantity of tomato puree ; add a strong suspi- 
cion of Nepaul pepper, and reduce the mixture for five 
minutes. When nice and thick, pour the sauce over the 
lobster, put the dish into the oven, and when thoroughly 
hot, serve.

follows : — Wash them, dry them, slit them in halves, and 
plunge them immediately into boiling water well salted ; 
let them remain in this bath for one minute only, take 
them out, and dry them in a napkin. This is an infallible 
recipe for the removal of that peculiar taste which many 
people dislike in kidneys ; it should be followed always, 
no matter how you intend to cook them. Well, having 
thus blanched the kidneys, proceed to boil them gently 
with some dried thyme, marjoram, and a bag containing 
spice, &c., till they are very tender. Take them out, and 
pound them in the mortar, with one well washed anchovy : 
when sufficiently pounded, pass the paste through a wire 
sieve to get rid of fibre, gi'istle, &c. When ready, place 
the consomme in a bowl handy, and keep the kidney paste

ready in a soup plate. Take a roomy sauce-pan, melt an 
ounce of butter at the bottom of it over the fire, stir in a 
table-spoonful of flour ; when nice and creamy, add a cup- 
ful of consomme, stirring vigorously, and continue to add 
consomme and kidney paste by degrees, working them 
well together, till you have used them up ; now let the 
puree come to the boil ; add a glass of port, a tea-spoonful 
of red currant jelly, a tea-spoonful of good vinegar, and 
sufficient caramel coloring to give the soup a warm brown 
tint, stir well for a minute over the fire, and serve with 
croutons of fried bread. 

A coffee-cupful of boiling cream, or a coffee-cupful of 
milk in which the yolk of an egg has been stirred, may 
be added to this soup off the fire for additional richness. 
-It will be found so like a game soup that many will doubt 
its having any connection with kidneys. After a day's

very acceptable.

worked with melted butter, over the maccaroni, and, as you 

arrange it, dust it with black pepper. Over the crab dredge 

a nice dressing of the grated cheese, about one-eighth of 

an inch deep, and pour a little melted butter over the

Maccaroni au gratin.

boil, and as soon as tender, drain it well ; put into a sauce- 
pan one ounce of butter, mix it well with one table-spoon-

(saved from the soup gravy), and a coffee-cupful of cream, 
or milk enriched with the yolk of an egg ; add two ounces 
of grated cheese, one table-spoonful of mustard, salt and 
pepper to taste : place the maccaroni in a shallow well

as above, amongst it ; dust a thick layer of grated cheese 
over the surface, and as soon as it browns nicely in the 
oven, send it to table. Maccaroni au gratin should be 
quite moist, and thoroughly impregnated with the flavoui'

Chaud-froid de filets de foie gras- 

This is a very nice cold entree. Open a tin of /o/e gras,

Cashraeer shawl patterns, or ovals. Put them on a flat 
dish, and mask them with chicken chaud-froid glaze. 
When the glaze has set, trim each fillet neatly, and set 
them in a circle with their masked sides outwards upon a 
socle of ground rice which should be spread with butter 
for them to adhere to it. Points d'asperges, flageolets, or a

pomfret. When the fish is nearly done, take it out of the 
oven ; pour the liquor from its dish into your veloute : 
garnish the fish with the oysters of the tin previously 
mentioned, and some black Leicestershire mushrooms, over 
all pour your veloute — which should be nice and thick, — 
set the dish in the oven again for five minutes, and serve 
with croutons of bread, buttered on each side, and coloured 
a pale brown in the oven. This will be found an excellent 
dish — far from difl&cult : veloute remember, is a rich 
creamy white sauce. 

3. — Tie a nice piece of fresh brisket of beef into a com- 
pact shape and lard it with plenty of 
jeUyltcowf ^""^ '"^ f ^* ^^con ■• braise it in stock, and vege- 
tnbles with a glass of white wine : 
when done, take it out, remove the string, and place the 
meat in an oblong shape with a heavy weight upon it ; 
when thoroughly cold, and set, trim it all round with a 
sharp knife, glaze it with its own gravy reduced, and set 
it in aspic in the ice-box. A plain oblong mould should 
be selected. When you turn it out, garnish with hard- 



MENU FOR A LITTLE HOME DINNER. 465 

boiled eggs, and parsley, and serve with the best salad you 
can devise, and a good mayonnaise sauce. Or, the beef 
may be served hot, with its own gravy thickened, and 
garnished with glazed onions. 

This recipe may be followed with a home-cnred ox- 
tongue : boil the tongue, of course, you cannot braise it. 

4. — Slice up a cold boiled (not over-boiled) vegetable 
marrow. Butter the bottom of a pie- 
Vegetable marrow ^^^^ i^^^ ^ 1 ^^ of gji^gg thereon, 
au gratin. . 

grate a little mild cheese over them, 

place another layer of slices above the first and strew 
grated cheese over that also. Now melt some butter in a 
small sauce-pan, and add a little gravy to it, together with 
some finely powdered cheese, when you have enough to 
half cover your layers of marrow, pour the liquid round 
them, and bake for ten minutes or so in a fast oven. Salt 
and pepper should be dusted over each layer, before the 
cheese gratings are added. 

This is a simple yet effective entremets sucre suggested 
to me by a Madras Gouffe. Tin'n out a

to taste in their own syrup. Melt an 
ounce of gelatine in water, and stir into the basin contain- 
ing the fruit ; now place this in a mould, and set it to get 
firm in the ice-box. The best creamy custards (also set 
in the ice-box) should go round in glasses ; this is cooling, 
and inexpensive. A glass of maraschino or cura9oa may 
be stirred into the syrup with manifest advantage.

ounce of butter, now add a pint of milk and water, two- 
thirds milk to one-third water, all the fish bones and 
trimmings, a few pepper corns, an anchovy, a blade of 
mace, and a pinch of salt ; boil this up and simmer it 
afterwards till you have extracted the flavour of your in- 
gredients : now strain the liquor, and thicken it as for a 
sauce blanche, gently heating your fillets of fish in the same : 
garnish with little bits of red chilli (cut into dice, and 
sprinkled over the fillets) and serve. The point here lies 
in the flavouring of the white sauce in which you warm 
your fish : so do not omit any thing I have mentioned. 

3. — '' First catch yoiu' duckling" eh ? well, I know they 

are not easy to get, but let those who 

^Duckling and green j^^^p ^^^^^ ^^ ^j^^i^ poultry yard try 

one before the breast-bone forms hard. 
The bone should be scarcely stronger than gristle if the 
bird be young enough. Roast, and do not stuff the duck- 
ling, let the basting be frequent, and froth the breast up 
nicely to finish with : serve, accompanied by green peas, 
and cook the potatoes according to any of the recipes 
given at page 136. 

N. B. — If your cook have a habit, as some have, of serv- 
ing the giblets of the duck in the gravy round the bird, 
put an end to it forthwith ; — it is one of those quaint 
relics of barbarism which still cling to certain Indian 
kitchens.

they always are in the hot weather. A dust of grated cheese 
over each piece may be given without fear. 

5. — Take a quarter of a pound of finely grated bread- 
crumbs, half a pound of minced dried 

Fig puddiug. r . i. £ 

figs, three ounces ot sugar, six ounces 

of chopped suet, and a little gi\ated nutmeg. Mix a tea- 
spoonful of Yeatman's baking powder with an ounce of 
flour, add this to the other ingredients with four eggs well 
beaten, moisten with a little milk sufficiently to form a 
firm paste, turn the mixtui-e into a buttered mould, and 
boil for three hours. 

Lime sauce. — Put three table-spoonfuls of sugar into a 
sauce-pan with a breakfast-cupful of water, and the very 
finely peeled rind of a lime, simmer for twenty minutes, 
then add the juice of two limes and a liqueur glass of any 
liqueur, brandy, or rum, strain and serve. A drop or two 
of cochineal will improve the colour of the sauce. 



Nougat 

Blanch a pound of almonds, and cut each lengthwise 
into thin narrow pieces, lay them on a dish in front of the 
fire, or in the oven (with the door open), to get perfectly 
dry ; melt in a sugar boiler Jib. of loaf sugar ; when the 
sugar is a rich brown, put in the almonds, mix them well 
but carefully together, and you will have a soft paste, 
which will harden when cold. Dip some small moulds 
into some very hot-water, slightly but thoroughly oil them 
with melted butter ; put some of the mixture in one of 
them, and with the handle of a tea-spoon previously but- 
tered, spread it out so as completely to line the mould ; 
trim the edges, and when cold, turn out the nougat. 
Having made a number of cases in the same way, serve 
them with whipped cream or sweetmeats inside each. 
The nougat should be very thin. Any kind of mould, 



MENU FOR A LITTLE HOME DINNER. 469 

large or small, may be used, and many fanciful devices 
may be worked with, tliis composition. The almond 
should be cut smaller for intricate designs, and in all 
cases the work must be done quickly, for the sugar soon 
becomes too stiff to be spread into position. 



Endive- 
Endive (cMcoree,) as grown in Southern India, is per- 
haps better when cooked than when presented raw in 
salad, for it lacks the crispness which the plant acquires 
at home in the winter. Endives should be trimmed for 
cooking by picking off the outside leaves, and cutting off 
the green tips. The heads should then be severed by a 
cut across the stalk, detaching all the leaves therefrom. 
Thus every leaf can be examined and cleaned. When this 
has been done, and the leaves have been drained dry, cast 
them into a roomy vessel full of boiling water with half 
an ounce of salt. Unlike spinach, which merely takes five 
minutes, endives must be boiled for twenty-five. When 
tender, drain, press out the water, and chop fine on a clean 
board, finishing as explained for spinach. If you simmer 
the endive leaves in consomme for two hours, and then 
increase the fire, stirring till the leaves have absorbed 
the broth, and finally moistening them with some rich 
hechamel and a pat of butter, you will have the correct 
foundation for a blanquefte a la Talleyrand, i.e., neat 
pieces of cooked chicken heated up in the endive sauce.

All who have tried pine-apple fritters witli rum will not 
hesitate to apply the same test to plantains. Dust over 
your fritters before serving them a nice coating of finely 
sifted white sugar. The rum or liqueur should be poured 
round the sliced plantains, like a marinade, an hour before 
they are cooked : it can be used in mixing the batter after- 
wards. The batter should not be too thick, and do not 
forget to have the bath of fat hot enough.

the prawns : when the latter have 

been boiled, shell and clean them, wash them well, dry 
them, and pound them thoroughly in a mortar with a lit- 
tle butter, and the crumb of a roll soaked in milk : pass 
this through the sieve, and season it with one anchovy, 
wiped free from oil, and chopped fine, a little curly parsley 
also minced, a little chopped marjoram, and a cold boiled 
onion shredded : give this a dust of pepper, and a little 
salt, and work it together thoroughly with a couple of 
raw eggs. Now lay your mullet on a flat dish, wipe it 
dry, and fill it with the prawn stuffing, sew up the fish 
securely. Butter a pie-dish, place the mullet therein, 
pour a breakfast cupful of broth round it, spread a little 
butter upon the top of it, and bake for about ten minutes 
or a quarter of an hour in a quick oven. A pat of maitre 
d' hotel butter should be placed on the top of the mullet 
before serving, and a spoonful or two of hock, or any light 
wine like chablis, poured round it during the baking, will 
be found an improvement. Baste the fish now and then 
during the cooking.

(each separately) and give them an external dusting of 



480 MENU FOR A LITTLE HOME DINNER. 

spiced pepper. Take a pie-dish, rub it well with a shallot, 
butter it, and place a layer of the rolled slices over the 
bottom of it, now potir gently round the layer a cupful of 
strong gravy made from the coarser meat previously men- 
tioned ; repeat the process adding another layer of rolled 
beef slices, and more gravy, till the dish is packed ; garnish 
the surface with pieces of hard boiled eg^, and cover the 
whole with a good light crust, bake in the usual way and 
serve. Oysters, minced anchovies, chopped olives, and 
mushrooms may, of course, be m.ingled with the layers ; 
and a glass of Madeira may enrich the gravy if you desire 
perfection. Let me here point out that Ramasamy's ordi- 
nary pie is a cruel burlesque of that dish. He first cooks 
the meat independently, then covers it with crust, and 
finally bakes it. The glory of a pie consists in the whole 
composition being baked together : attention is, of course, 
necessary to keep the oven at the proper temperature, 
and to avoid hurrying matters, or, of course, the crust will 
take colour too soon, and your pie be burnt. For savoury 
pie crust, see Chapter XXVI.

whisk the whites to a stifi froth independently ; then

souffle tin, and bake it in a very quick oven, send it to 
table the moment it is ready, dusted over with finely sifted 
sugar. A little preserve may accompany the omelette

agreeable addition. The great thing is, to serve immedi- 
ately : you cannot therefore bake the souffle in a distant

kitchen : the baking should be conducted as close to the 
dining-room door, as possible, and the dish should be 
brought in the nick of time. A proper souffle tin is, of 
course, absolutely necessary for this dish. 



Pain de fromage. 

This is of mould of " cheese cream." Make half a pint 
of rich custard, season it with salt instead of sugar, and 
a little Nepal pepper ; whip it well, stir in three ounces of 
grated Parmesan or Gruyere, and half an ounce of dis- 
solved gelatine. Set the mixture in a plain mould on ice, 
and, while setting, stir in a coffee-cupful of whipped cream. 
Turn out the mould, garnish with sprigs of parsley, and 
serve cold. 

Following the same principle very excellent pains, or 
cremes can be made with purees of delicate meats, fish, and 
vegetables. Creme de homard, creme de crevettes, creme 
d'artichauts, pain de gihier, 8fC. If required to be served 
liot, the contents of the mould must be steamed like a 
pudding, the cream being stirred into the custard in the 
first instance. It is essential that the purees be thoroughly 
pounded, and passed through the sieve. Cold savoury 
creams are specially nice at luncheon. These dishes are 
sometimes called mousse de homard mousse de crevetteSy 8fc.

1. — This is a very simple method of turning an ordinary 
clear gi'avy soup into a recherche pot- 
ported egg»°'' "'"' "?«• Tho eggs (one for each person) 
must however be carefully poached, 
neither too lightly nor too hard, then trimmed neatly 
leaving as little margin of white as possible, and served 
with the soup. A few leaves of dried tarragon flavour the 
consomme very pleasantly, and grated Parmesan should be 
handed round on a separate plate. If you have no tar- 
ragon leaves, try a little of the vinegar. 

Note this : — In order to make sure of not breaking the 
eggs in the tureen, — order your butler to heat the soup 
plates and place the poached eggs in them, before he 
serves the soup : he can then pour the soup over the eggs, 
instead of having to ladle them out of the soup, which is 
always an operation requiring much delicacy of touch, and 
a broken egg spoils the appearance of the consomme.

The composition I think very much nicer is a creamy

boiled, and cleaned, pounded to a paste in a mortar, 
flavoured with an anchovy, a little spice, pepper, and salt, 
and then worked with melted butter, floui', and a little 
broth, to the consistency I have mentioned. It should be 
served as hot as possible.

and dress the sorrel independently.

make some gravy with scraps and 

trimmings : it would be as well indeed to order a little 

extra meat for that purpose, when you have got this to 

your mind, strain it off and keep it handy. Now take a 

frying-pan, melt a piece of butter at the bottom of it, and 

shred an onion therein ; lay the steak upon it, and turn it 

about until it is well browned on both sides ; now lift it 

up and place it in your stew-pan, with the gravy and 

vegetables, to simmer gently till done, which you can test 

with a fork. It ought to be as tender as possible if you 

are only careful enough to prevent galloping, that is, fast 

cooking : the slow simmering process is the thing needful. 

The vegetables cooked with the steak may be strained 

from the gravy, and cut up into neat dice, to garnish the 

top of the steak : the gravy must be saved for the sorrel 

which you must cook as follows : — 

Put two good handfuls of carefully picked sorrel in 
plenty of boiling water, with a little salt, and a pinch of 
soda, blanch for five minutes, drain, and chop the leaves 
small on a board. Melt two ounces of butter in a sauce=

of sugar, and the steak gravy stirring vigorously to prevent 
the leaves catching at the bottom of the pan : — "WTien the 
gravy and butter are thoroughly well absorbed, turn the 
sorrel out, stir in the yolks of three eggs beaten up in a 
little milk, and pour the ^uree round the steak, which 
should have been kept hot whilst the last stage was com- 
pleted. The sorrel should, of course, be got ready before- 
hand.

fire, before serving. A few drops of lime juice are an 
improvement, and to those who think that they might 
not like the onion-flavoured milk, that of pounded almonds 
may be more pleasing.

Ramasamy stuff a wild duck like a tame -one ! need I do 
more than warn you that this is erroneous ? Having 
served the bird with all the gi'avy that was caught during 
the roasting on a very hot dish, what must we do for a 
sauce on the spot ? This will be found a good one : — 
Score the breast of the bird in the direction you intend to 
slice it, and let the gravy run out bountifully ; to that add 
a table-spoonful of port, burgundy, or fruity Madeira, (the 
first if possible) give that a dessert-spoonful of lime-juice

and six drops of " tabasco,'' or a tea-spoonful of chilli 
vinegar ; stir the gravy round with a spoon, and baste the 
breast of the duck liberally with it, then go on with your 
carving. If you have a little sauce-boat on a spirit lamp 
by your side (a beautiful modern invention) the gravy 
can be heated therein, on the spot admirably.

Butter a small but deep pie- dish or

the charlotte) the size and shape of the top of the mould, 
butter it on both sides, and put it into the mould ; now 
line the side of the mould with moderately thin strips of 
bread and butter, buttered on both sides : that is to say, 
cover both the inverted top and sides of the mould, mak- 
ing a case of bread and butter as it were. Within the case 
place layers of apples cut small, (or sliced ripe plantains) 
with apricot jam spread between each layer, some lime 
juice sprinkled over them all, and a good allowance of 
white sugar ; when packed, cover the bottom of the mould 
with slices of bread and butter, the same as that used for 
the top and sides, and bake till the bread browns nicely. 
Use plenty of good butter please, and you will find this a 
simple but pleasant sweet dish : a sprinkling of any liqueur 
would, of course, add to the nice flavour of the fruit. 
Turn it out very carefully, and let cold custards accom- 
pany the charlotte.

sino-e, and truss tlie florican placing a Bombay onion, rolled 
in fat boiled bacon, inside its carcass. Tie a thin slice oi 
bacon over the breast, and roast the bird over a moderate 
fire, basting it frequently with melted butter. A few 
minutes before the florican is done, remove the slice of 
bacon, so as to let the breast take colour. Serve with 
plain gravy, fried crumbs, and bread sauce. Time, about 
thirty minutes. Proceed in the same way if you happen 
to have a wild pea-chick, a young jungle fowl, or a spur 
fowl. 

A most appropriate accompaniment to roast florican 
roast pheasant, guinea fowl, &c., ai^e : — 

Croustades de truffes a I'Espagnole- 

Line as many little open tartlet pans as you have guests 
with some carefully made short-bread paste. An oval not 
much larger than the bowl of a table spoon is the shape 
best suited to the purpose. Butter them well first to keep 
them from burning, and preserve their hollow centres 
while baking them by a piece of stale bread, to be removed 
afterwards. Cut up some truffles in dice, using enough to 
yield a good dessert-spoonful per head. Warm the mince 
np gently in some rich Espagnole sauce flavoured with a 
dash of Madeira, and keep it en hain-rnarie. When want- 
ed, fill the crisp croustades with a spoonful each of the 
truffles and sauce, dish them en serviette, and send them 
round with the bird. Croustades de champignons, made in 
the same way but substituting mushrooms for truffles, may 
be served with roast game very effectively.

bunch of parsley. When the joint comes home, detach 
the meat from the bones en masse, roll it up compactly, 
and tie it firmly with a string. — See that your soup ket- 
tle is thoroughly clean, put in the bones (chopped up) 
first, and place your bundle of meat above them, pouring 
in cold water enough to cover the top of the meat — with 
one and a half ounce of salt and nothing else. Ramasamy 
throws in all his vegetables to begin with, which is an 
utterly erroneous proceeding. Now set the pot near the 
fire, and let the contents come as slowly as possible to the 
boil, skimming off every atom of scum as it rises, and add- 



488 MENU FOR A LITTLE HOME DINNER. 

iiig from time to time a little cold water to retard ebulli- 
tion, and encourage the rising of the scum. Keep the 
vessel open throughout the operations, otherwise the soup 
will not be bright and clear. This having been completed, 
and the pot boiling with a clean surface, you may cast in 
your vegetables (the carrots first, followed by the turnip) 
all nicely washed, trimmed, and cut up. In addition, you 
must give the soup a tea-spoonful of caramel (burnt sugar 
colouring), a dessert-spoonful of sugar, a dozen pepper 
corns, and a bag containing mixed sweet herbs (a tea- 
spoonfal of each). These additions will stop the boiling 
you will find, so watch the vessel narrowly, and as soon as 
boiling begins again, ease o£E the fire, and let the contents 
of the kettle simmer till the vegetables are nicely done. 
Now take the kettle from the fire, remove the vegetables 
and put the meat broth and bone back on a low fire to 
simmer slowly until you find that the first is nice and ten- 
der, — done in fact. The time of this will depend upon the 
size of the meat and the accuracy of the simmering : from 
two to three hours is the ordinary period. As soon as the 
meat is done, the soup is ready also : keeping the meat 
overdoing will not give you a fraction more strength in 
the broth. So strain it from the meat, and set it to 
cool. Place the meat and vegetables separately on dishes. 
When the broth is cold, take off any fat that may have 
risen to its surface, and return the liquor to the sauce-pan. 
Cut up some of the vegetables into nice pieces and place 
them in the soup tureen, let the contents of your sauce- 
pan come almost to the boil, and pour them over the vege- 
tables. It will be a bright clear soup, with a capital 
flavour : a dessert-spoonful of Madeira and a dried leaf or 
two of tarragon will improve it. The colour will depend 
upon the amount of caramel you put into the pot. A nice 
golden yellow is easily obtained.

bread-crumb the fish with finely sifted crumbs, and fry 
it in plenty of fat, with the side bearing the incision 
uppermost. The edges of this will curl outwards in 
the process of frying, and the opening thus made should 
be filled at the time of serving with plenty of maitre 
cVhotel butter, the sole being sprinkled with fine salt. 
While the fish is being drained in front of the fire, the 
back-bone may be removed carefully, but this is not 
essential. 

3. — After draining the rolled rib meat mentioned in 
, . No. 1, and letting it get cold, place it 

on a dish that will stand the oven, 
brush it over with egg, and dredge over it a coating of 
very finely grated dry cheese, and bread-crumbs, in equal 
proportions : set it in the oven to heat thoroughly, and 
brown the outside of the crumbs with a hot iron used 
salamander fashion. When ready, put the meat on a dish, 
and trim round it a circle of hot maccaroni freshly boiled, 
drained, and tossed in melted butter : over which pour a 
breakfast-cupful of rich tomato puree, with two table- 
spoonfuls of grated Parmesan or Gruyere, and serve. If 
you are careful not to over-do the boiling of the meat as 
previously noted, you will find this dish, — all details being 
carefully carried out, — a very eatable one. A nice thick 
brown gravy made with butter, flour, and some of the 
houillon, flavoured with a spoonful of Marsala and a tea- 
spoonful of red currant jelly, should go round in a boat. 
This is also a nice way of serving a fowl. The broth being

serve piping hot. If you can pour some melted maitre 
d'hotel, or prawn butter over them, the dish becomes quite 
worth serving at a dinner party.

tar two ounces of blanched sweet almonds, three bitter ones,

and passed through a hair sieve. Mix the eggs, sugar, and 
almond paste. Turn a quart of milk to curd, crumble it, 
and beat it up with four ounces of good butter till quite 
smooth, then mix it thoroughly with the eggs, almonds, 
&c., adding a glass of brandy, and one of maraschino.

with finely sifted sugar dusted over them.

then set on the fire, will turn milk to a cnrd as quickly as 
anything, or two tea-spoonfuls of preserved ' rennet' will 
turn a quart of milk ; the homely way, however, is to boil 
a pint of water in a stew-pan, to beat two eggs up with a 
pint of milk, and to add the mixture to the boiling water, 
with the juice of a couple of limes. As the curd rises it 
should be skimmed of, and laid upon a sieve to drain. 
When dry, it is ready.

246). Pour some of the following sauce over the pieces 
of lobster, but not over the rice, and serve. Cut up a 
sweet onion, or half a dozen shalots, and throw the pieces 
into a small stew-pan with two ounces of butter. Fry till 
the onions begin to take color, then stir in"a table-spoonful 
of good curry powder or paste ; cook this for five minutes, 
then add a pint of plain gravy ; let the contents of the 
pan simmer now for a quarter of an hour while you make 
a coffee cupful of lait d'amandes in this way : — Blanch 
and peel a quarter of a pound of sweet almonds with one 
bitter one ; pound them in a mortar with a little milk ; 
when well pounded, pour some boiling water upon them ;

this into the sauce, adding the yolks of two eggs, off the 
fire, before serving. 




On Coffee-Making. 



N certain occasions in the course of my jottings, T 
have mentioned the cup of cafe noir as the finishing 
touch of a nice little dinner. I think, therefore, 
that I may as well say a few words regarding its composi- 
tion before I ask you to consider my menus ended. 

Although few may think themselves ignorant of coffee- 
making, I question whether its real secrets are generally 
known. Indeed to judge by the stuff that we usually get, 
I think, we may say that the art is comparatively rare. 
First, to be sure, you must " catch your coffee," i.e. : — get 
really good berries, and be willing to pay a trifle over the 
usual price for them. That done, the next thing to learn 
is the roasting, an operation that should be conducted 
daily if you want well-flavoured coffee. The process is by 
no means as easy as many believe ; half the coffee we 
drink is ruined by ignorant roasting ; a burnt berry, mark 
you, will spoil the whole brew. The best way, I think, to 
roast the berries is to do a few at a time in a frying-pan 
over a very low fire, passing them straight to the mill (a 
liand-mill is quite indispensable) from the pan. A table- 
spoonful of berries will be found quite enough at a time. 
Melt a little butter, sufficient to lubricate the berries, and 
stir them about until they turn a light Havannah brown ; 
if perchance a berry take a darker tint, throw it away as 
you would a reptile ; grind them at once as coarsely as 



ON COFFEE-MAKING. 493 

your mill will admit, — the grains should be quite as large 
as those of rifle guu-powder, — and make the coffee as soon 
afterwards as possible. 

A little butter or salad oil is strongly recommended, 
it prevents the escape of much of the fragrance of the 
berry while roasting, and becomes quite dried up before 
the roasting is finished. The custom in the Indian kitchen 
is to bake, often to over-hake, the berries and then tunny- 
cutch anwiah pounds them to a dull black powder as fine 
as flour. The result is a leaden tinted liquid, acrid in 
flavour, and repulsive to look upon. 

Having ground the coffee properly, — it should be rich 
in aroma, and of a beautiful pale snuff colour — the best 
coffee- pot to use, after all, is the percolator. Be liberal 
with the coffee (a table-spoonful for each person), heat the 
coffee-pot thoroughly, fill the upper chamber of the perco- 
lator according to your requirements, ram the coffee down 
flrml}^, and having previously measured the amount of 
coffee liquid you require, pour boiling water, according to 
that measurement, in tea-spoonfuls at a time, through the 
upper strainer upon the powder. The slower the water is 
added, the more thoroughly the coffee will become soaked, 
and, the dripping being retarded, the essence will be as 
strong as possible. As soon as the coffee has run through, 
pour the rich essence you have obtained into 3^our cups, 
and for cafe au lait fill them up with boiling milk, for cafe 
noir with a little boiling water. 

As it is scarcely possible for your servant to make coffee 
with all this care at the end of a dinner party, I recom- 
mend that the essence be made just before dinner, and 
kept covered up. For a party of twelve, two brews will 
be required. At the time it is wanted, the boiling milk 
imparts quite enough heat to the essence in the case of cafe 
au lait ; and, for black coffee, a gentle re-heating, plus the 
modicum of boiling water aforesaid, insures a good cup , 

53

only, do not forget to pass ronnd with it a flask of cognac 
vieil. I have confined my remarks to the method -which 
I have folloTved for years successfully, but there arc, of 
course, other ways of making good coffee. 

The Turkish system much praised by travellers may be 
thus described : — The roasting having been conducted 
with all the care I have already indicated, the berries arc 
cast into a large metal mortar, and pounded to a very fine 
powder. This is carefully sifted through a fine sieve, all 
coarse particles being rejected. As much water as is 
wanted is then boiled in a small copper can, having a 
narrow top and broad bottom. When the water boils, 
powdered coffee is added, off the fire, according to require- 
ments, and the can is replaced on the fire. The liquid is 
now permitted to come to the boil three times, the can 
after each occasion of ebullition being taken off the fire 
for a while. After the third boiling up, the can is placed 
for a minute in a shallow vessel containing cold water to 
precipitate the " grounds," after which the coffee clear, 
black, and sparkling is poured into the cup. For this 1 
have to thank Colonel 11. M. 




The last, most worthy, recipe of all. 



JTlT is not generally known, my dear Wyvern," -svrites 
Jm. my learned, and very kind friend C. S., " tliat the 
fumes of siilplinr prevent the rapid decomposition 
of animal matter, and that a fine tender mutton chop can 
be had, even in the hottest weather, by exposing the joint 
from which it is cut to the fumes of burning pastiles, 
placed in an air tight box, for two or three hours after the 
meat is brought home from market. A joint thus treated 
will keep perfectly for thirty-six hours, even in Madras, 
and be found deliciously tender the day after it was pur- 
chased. The pastiles should be composed as follows : — 
Eight parts of powdered sulphur. 
One and a half part of powdered charcoal. 
A quarter part of powdered saltpetre. 
Mix all together, and make them into pastiles, adding, 
just enough gum wat^r for the purpose ; shape them like 
pyramids, and dry them in the sun. A roomy box, — say 
a three-dozen case, — furnished with hooks to suspend the, 
meat by, with a closely fitting door, and all crevices filled 
with putty, and pasted over with strips of strong paper, is 
the sort of receptacle you require for the fumigation. 
Suspend the meat, place two or three pastiles below it, light 
them, close the door securely, and leave well alone." 



Our Kitchens ni India. 



(Reprinted, hy permission, from the Madras Mail.) 

EMEMBERIXG as we all can so well the cheerful 
aspect of the English kitchen, its trimness, its 
comfort, and its cleanliness, how comes it to pass 
that in India we continue year after year to be fully aware 
that the chamber set apart for the preparation of our food 
is, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, ilie foulest in our 
premises — and are not ashamed ? In the matter of uten- 
sils, and the general accessories of culinary work also, — 
knowing what things are considered essentially necessary 
even in the quietest establishment at home, — why are so 
many of us satisfied with an equipment regarding the 
miserable inadequacy of which it would be as well to keep 
silence ? Why, in short, in the one country are we scru- 
pulously careful that our food shall be clean, and in the 
other at all times willing, apparently, to eat dirt ? 

Over and over again have revolting facts been discover- 
ed in connection with the habits and customs of the cook- 
room. But instead of striking at the root of the evil, and 
taking vigorous action to inaugurate reform, we are abso- 
lutely callous enough not only to tolerate barbarisms, but 
even to speak of the most abominable practices as jests ! 
Though cognizant, that is to say, of the ingenious nastiness 
of our cooks, we shrug our shoulders, close our eyes, and 
ask no questions, accepting with resignation a state of 



OUR KITCHENS IN INDIA, 49" 



thines which we consider to be as inevitable as it is dis- 



But stop a moment : — is it inevUahle ? Let us consider 
that point. The fons et oriqo jnali, it seems to me, are to 
be detected without difficulty. Think, first of all, of the 
distances which as a rule separate our kitchens from our 
houses, and the fact that the room is part and parcel of a 
block of godowns — not unfrequently within easy access of 
the stables. Setting aside other considerations for a mo- 
ment, do we not at once perceive here two grave evils : — 
in the first place that proper supervision of the kitchen is 
almost out of the question ; and, in the second, that pro- 
miscuous gatherings of outsiders, — the friends, relations, 
and children (a fruitful source of dirtiness) of our servants, 
— can take place in it undetected ? Again : the room is 
generally constructed with as little ventilation and light 
as possible, its position w4th regard to the sun is never 
thought of, and arrangements for its pi-oper drainage are 
rare. As there is no scullery, or place for washing up, &c., 
the ground in the immediate vicinity of the kitchen re- 
ceives the foul liquid (as well as all refused matter) which 
is carelessly thrown out upon it. The consequence is that 
hard by many a cook-room in this Presidency, there is a 
noisome cesspool containing an inky looking fluid, the 
exhalations from which can scarcely improve the more 
delicate articles of food which are sent from the house for 
preparation. 

Now follow me into the room. It is as black as Erebus. 
The pungent smoke from yonder wood fire, upon which 
some water for a bath is being boiled, penetrates every 
crevice. There is no chimney, you see, so the wall, up 
which the smoke is creeping towards an opening in the 
roof, is lined by an ancient coating of soot. Observe tlie 
mass of patriarchal looking cobwebs depending from the

rafters, and the floor of motlier-eartli, gi-easy, black, and 
cruelly uneven in its surface. 

Pull yourself together now, for we are about to examine 
the kitchen table. It is, to begin ^vith, a piece of furni- 
ture ^vhicll it would be gross flattery to call a dresser. It 
is small, and \cyj rickety. In colour it is a remarkably 
warm burnt umber. The legs which support it arc be- 
grimed with dust which has become coagulated from time 
to time by grease, and smoked a rich sable. If you wished 
to do so, you could scrape off this filtliy tegument with 
your pen-knife to the depth of the sixteenth of an inch. 
The top of the table is notched and scored all over Avith 
wounds inflicted by the chopper, the edges are all worn 
down, and there are tell-tale marks which prove that it is 
the custom of the chef and his assistants to mince parslc}', 
herbs, onions, aye the meat itself of which those "chicken 
cutlets" that he delights to give you are made, upon the 
oily, nut-brown board. 

What are that stone sLab and roller for, with traces of 
last night's spinach upon them ? O ! they are the pet 
articles de cuisine of tunny-cutch ammah to whose delicate 
fingers is entrusted the making of chutneys, and all pre- 
parations which are presented to you in the form of pulp. 
The boiled vegetable, or whatever it may be, is turned 
out upon the slab, and she rolls the pin backwards and 
forwards until the desired consistency is attained. How 
does she scrape the rolling pin, and the edges of the slab 
during this process, and how does she dish it ? Hush, my 
friend, there is not a spoo)i in the l-itchen. 

Cast your eye over that meagre array of degchees and 
of sauce-pans nearly as black inside as they are outside, 
and note that there is a spit there, a chatty oven in yonder 
corner, and — nothing more. There is no cupboard, neither 
is there a rack for plates and dishes, but such small

etcetera as the cook uses are thrust at hajD-hazard upon that 
shelf, ^hich, in gi^iminess, you see, matches the table, 
whilst it comes in handily for his turband, and the folded 
leaf containing his snuff. You have seen enough now, 
and look as if you wanted a brandy and soda, so let us 
return to the house. 

On our way you inveigh against native filthiness, &c., 
&c. Come now, be just in your condemnations, for verily 
this is a case in which it behoves us to remember the 
beam which is in our own eye, before we seek diligently 
to pull out the mote which is in our black brother's eye. 
Who is really to blame for a great deal that I have shown 
you ? Is it the cook's fault that a wretchedly mean, 
carelessly constructed godown is given him for a kitchen ; 
that the place is inconveniently far from the house, and 
consequently open to every passer-by ; that the furniture 
is absolutely nothing more than one table, far too small 
for culinary requirements, and one shelf ; that owing to 
faulty construction, the room ' smokes' dreadfully, and 
that there is scarcely sufficient light in it to detect dirt ? 
Is it the cook's fault that in the absence of proper ap- 
pliances he is forced to practise his native ingenuity, 
to use chatties for sauce-pans and stew-pans, to use the 
* curry-stone' for a mortar, his cloth for a sieve, and his 
fingers for a spoon or fork ? Is it the cook's fault that, 
since no plates and dishes are included in his cook-room 
equipment, he has no alternative but to place meat, vege- 
tables, &c., on his table; and that being without a mincing 
machine, or chopping board, he uses its surface in lieu of 
the latter ? Why instead of denouncing the unfortunate 
man, I make bold to say that handicapped as he is, we 
have positively no reason to expect him to be clean ! 

Xow I do not mean to say that the state of things that 
I have endeavoured to sketch obtains in every Madras 
establishment, On the contrary, I am quite sure that in 



500 OUR KITCHENS IN INDIA. 



some cases the utmost trouble is taken to make everything 
as clean and as nice as possible, that every available 
appliance is given to the cook with a generous hand, and 
that the mistress of the house prides herself upon visiting 
her kitchen and seehnj that her orders are carried out. Xo : 
it is not to the energetic few that I dedicate these com- 
ments, but to the apathetic many who actually know not 
what they do — to themselves and to their friends — by 
permitting the preparation of their food to take care of 
itself. People who refrain from all interference, who hand 
everything over to their butlers, and take cleanliness for 
granted, do so, I know, sometimes through sheer ignorance, 
sometimes on account of idleness, and sometimes because 
they are not physicallj- cquiil to the exertion. I frankly 
admit that the labour is frequently very disheartening. 
It strikes me, however, that if reform were made easier 
and pleasanter, many who are now content to let things 
' slide' might wake up and become enthusiastic, while 
even those, who do not know what trouble means in the 
matter of perfecting their cuisine, would be thankful to 
find their daily task less irksome. Let us, therefore, 
briefly consider how that object might be achieved. 

Taking the kitchen itself first : why on earth should we 
continue to accept as places fit for the cooking of our food 
the dismal hovels that are attached to our godowns, and 
called cook-rooms ? These places may have suSiced for 
the culinary necessities of our forefathers, who chiefly 
preyed upon curry and rice, and lived to all intents and 
purposes a la mode Indienne. But nous avons change tout 
cela. The delicate cookery which day by day gains popu- 
larity in India now demands a clean airy room, properly 
furnished, with plenty of light, and many accessories 
borrowed from civilized Europe. 

It has become essential, in fact, that to every house 
there should be attached a small building reserved solely 



OUR KITCHENS IN INDIA. 501 

for kitchen work and — nothing else. It should be 
quite close to the house, and connected with the back 
verandah by a covered way. It should be constructed 
with a frontage towards the north or south so that the 
rays of the morning and evening sun may strike its sides. 
It should contain three rooms : — the work-room, the 
cooking-room, and the scullery, all opening into a good 
verandah. 

In the first, the food, pastry, &c., should be prepared ; it 
should therefore be well ventilated, and have a good glass 
window or sky light, a large dresser, a marble pastry slab, 
a rack for plates and dishes, shelves for cups, jugs, bowls, 
&c., a cupboard for culinary stores, and a gauze meatsafe 
to protect meat, &c., from flies. Communication between 
this room and the cooking-room should be shut off so that 
no smoke could find its way into it : things should be 
carried to the kitchen via the verandah. 

The cooking-room should, if possible, contain an English 
or American range. Failing that, a country-made range 
upon English principles, the construction of which I will 
discuss by-and-by. It should be well ventilated, well 
lighted, and, in any circumstances, should contain a 
chimney. A table for dishing up, &c., would be required 
here, and also racks for ladles, dredgers, &c., with shelves 
for the utensils. 

The scullery being merely used for washing up, the 
drawing, cleaning, and plucking of poultry, and work 
of that nature, would require a well made water-tight 
sink, communicating with an equally carefully made 
cistern, covered by a trap-door, outside the building : 
the cistern should be emptied every day, and well 
sprinkled with McDougall's disinfecting powder. A tap 
of Red Hills water in the scullery would bo a great boon 
at Madras. 



502 OUR KITCHENS IN INDIA. 

Tlie floor of room number one might be of chiinam mat- 
ted over, that of number two shoukl be paved with slabs 
of stone, and a similar one of stone should be laid down in 
the scullery. 

The day's work having been completed, the doors of 
the three rooms should be carefully locked, and the whole 
corps de cuisine dismissed, the keys being brought to the 
mistress of the house. The idea of the kitchen being 
used by a number of native employes as a sleeping cham- 
ber is obviously too horrible to need more than a passing 
remark. 

The two chief objections tli:it will here suggest them- 
selves will bo, I feel sure, on the one hand the difficulty 
of establishing the kind of kitchen I have described, and, 
on the other, the expense of equipping it according to the 
standard which obtains in England. I propose, therefore, 
to deal with those points independently, taking the kit- 
chen first. 

The little building that I advocate, — entirely separat- 
ed from the godowns, planned specially to meet culi- 
nary requirements, close to the house, and connected 
with it by a covered way, — in spite of its niceness 
theoretically, is, I admit, practically speaking almost 
an impossibility. Few owners of houses 'vould go to 
the expense of a new building. I nevertheless offer 
the idea to those who are about to build de novo^ 
and to such of my fellow countrymen, who, interested 
in houses that they have purchased, may be tempted 
to make their " offices" as complete, and as home-like 
as possible. 

In what way, then, can anything be done to im- 
prove upon matters as they at present stand ? Well, 
a great deal, of course, depends upon circumstances. 
There are a good many houses that possess small build- 



OUR KITCHENS IN INDIA. 503 

ings close to the back verandahs, which, I presume, were 
originally intended to be used as a " coolers' godo^Yns," 
or, perhaps, for the hanging of meat. Thej cannot be of 
mnch use for either of those purposes now-a-days, for the 
ancient cooler's " occupation's gone," and the modern zinc- 
lined safe has made us independent of a larder. It seems 
to me, then, that some of these little places might be 
easily converted into kitchens, large enough at all events 
to accommodate one of the small yet very excellent Anglo- 
American cooking ranges now procurable, together Avith 
its accessories, and such things as are necessary for mere 
cooking. A place for washing up might easily be con- 
trived on one side, or at the back of this room, and a light 
covered way might be thrown up cheaply enough to con- 
nect it with the house. 

Assuming such an arrangement feasible, the sacrifice of 
some small back room on the ground flour of the house, or 
the walling off of a portion of the back verandah would 
still be necessary to provide the " working room," — the 
room, that is to say, in which all food should be 'prepared 
prior to being conveyed to the kitchen. This I may call 
one of the chief points of the system I advocate, for, I 
maintain, that for numerous undeniable reasons, the 
making of pastry, the dressing of meat and vegetables, 
and the mixing of sauces, puddings, &c., should be per- 
formed in a cool place, away from the smoke and heat of 
fires, where wand and dust can be excluded by closing the 
door, and yet ample light be obtained from a good glass 
window, and, above all things, where the chef can be easily 
supervised. 

To illustrate the necessity of this recommendation, let 
us imagine that a cook, accommodated as he is at present, 
is engaged in preparing a souffle, or some equally delicate 
entremets. Of a sudden a blast of wind drives a cloud of 
dust into the cook-room through the door (which is of 



504 OUR KITCHENS IN INDIA. 



necessity open to admit light), and blows myriads of fine 
particles of cliareoal ashes from the open fire-places over 
everything. By-and-by the dish is served at dinner. 
Monsieur le mari cheerfully receives liLs portion, but pre- 
sently encounters grit, and orders his plate to be taken 
away, murmuring something about the impolicy of petty 
economy in connection with flour. Madame la chatelaine^ 
conscious of procuring the best of everything, replies — 
more in sorrow than in anger, yet withal warmly — and 
denies the unkind impeachment, though constrained to 
send her plate away also. And thus a cloud comes over 
w^hat ought to be a very happy tete-.i-tctey while indiges- 
tion, the natural result of irritation at meals, most pro- 
bably follows. 

Now the worst of it is that unless people happen to 
discover the real causes of accidents such as these 
themselves, they may wait until doomsday for enlighten- 
ment. The mental equilibrium of the native cook is in 
no wise disturbed by a dust storm, for he is perfectly 
accustomed to tliem ; and the butler Avill assuredly invent 
a plausible excuse for the contretemps : — " little bit yegg- 
shell," or " sugar mistake." It therefore comes to this, 
that we must insist upon a nicer appreciation of the 
cleanliness and care that the preparation of food demands, 
and to accomplish that end satisfactorily a room of the 
kind I have described appears to me to be essentially 
necessary. 

I am perfectly aware that, in some instances, every 
species of obstruction will at first be thrust in the way of 
those who try to follow my advice, and, in others, that 
the change will be obeyed with reluctance. But deter- 
mination and tact combined will, I think, overcome opposi- 
tion after a time, and the very malcontents themselves 
w411 end by praising the now regime. 



OUR KITCHENS IN INDIA. 505 

It is downright nonsense to say that native cooks cannot 
work upon English principles. They manage very well 
on boardship, where their services are highly prized, yet 
their appliances are wholly European. The kitchen at 
the Madras Club, and those of several private houses, both 
here, and on the Hills, are fitted up entirely upon the 
Home system, yet the cooks do not complain. No : it 
seems pretty clear that if no other alternative present it- 
self, Ramasamy can fall into the way of using a range 
readily enough. 

I know of a case in which a young and zealous native 
chef absolutely begged his mistress to permit him to pre- 
pare his jellies, pastry, &c., in a spare room in the house, 
alleging as his reason that the kitchen was too hot and 
smoky : and I am perfectly sure that the majority of good 
Madras cooks would appreciate a similar concession. The 
reciisants would, in all probability, be gentlemen who have 
become wedded to practices whereof their consciences are 
afraid. Pilferings of all kinds would, to begin with, 
become far more difficult, long absences would be soon 
detected, work properly the cook's could not be thrust 
upon the cook's maty, and drinking and gossiping during 
working hours would be knocked on the head. 

The furnishing of this " working room" could be man- 
aged without much trouble, and certainly inexpensively, in 
the manner already mentioned : — with a dresser of strong 
wood, a pastry table with marble slab, a cup-board, a rack 
for plates and dishes, a gauze safe, and a set of shelves. 
Delicate operations, such as the composition of high class 
sauces, the boiling of a jelly, or the simmering of fruit, 
could be carried on upon a mineral oil stove, or by means 
of a charcoal fire placed in a sheltered corner of the veran- 
dah close to the room ; and such articles of diet need 
never be carried into the kitchen at all. But when pro- 
perly dressed, and prepared for roasting, stewing, boiling, 



506 OUR KITCHENS IN INDIA 



baking, &c., savoury meats, pastry, and puddings, ^vould, 
of course, be transported to the cooking-room. 

In cases \rbere there is no isolated building near the 
house susceptible of conversion into a kitchen, the cook- 
room, such as it may be, would have to be utilized ; but if 
properly ventilated, fitted up with a range, racks, tables, 
&c., frequently inspected, and reserved exclusively for the 
work I have mentioned, its evils might surely to be re- 
duced to a minimum. 

Another great thing to obtain, to my mind, is a really 
clean place, not only for the preparation of food, but also 
for its keeping during the day. Think for a moment of 
the dish of neck of mutton cutlets that the cook takes 
away to the cook-room at 10 a.m., after his mistress has 
inspected the market supplies. The cutlets re-appear at 
dinner time, it is true, but dare we consider how the poor 
things spent their day before the hour of their cooking 
arrived ? In my ideal room they would be trimmed im- 
mediately . upon a clean dresser, flattened with the cutlet 
bat, and then arranged neatly upon a large flat dish, 
dusted over with pepper and salt, lightly dredged with 
flour, and consigned till wanted in the gauze safe ; or, if 
so required, they might be placed in marinade^ and then 
put away beyond the reach of flies. The trimmings would, 
of course, be collected upon a plate, and sent out to the 
kitchen for the production of broth for sauce. 

And now for a few words about kitchen ranges and 
equipments. Until almost the other day, so to speak, an 
English range was regarded as too expensive a luxury for 
people in India of ordinary means. The expenditure of 
from two to three hundred rupees upon such a thing was 
looked upon as an extravagant freak. This strange opinion 
must have been born and bred in Hindustan a generation 
or more ago, and handed down to as together with numer- 



OUR KITCHENS IN INDIA. 507 

ous other baseless nostrums in the usual course of things ; 
for people could scarcely have forgotten — even forty years 
ago — that dwellings built for persons of three hundred a 
year at home were considered uninhabitable unless equip- 
ped with a kitchen range that at least cost thirty pounds. 

Of course, there was an excuse for the economy, one 
indeed, that is readily pleaded, I dare say, to-day : — An 
English range would be thrown away upon a native cook, 
he could never appreciate its advantages, and would fall 
back upon his own way of doing things the moment he 
was left to himself. With this ingenious subterfuge num- 
bers of people have been contented, and have willingly 
closed their eyes year after year to the wastefulness, and 
barbarity, of the native system. 

The consequence is that we now find ourselves in a some- 
what anomalous position. Whereas our taste have under- 
gone a complete change for the better; whereas men of 
moderate means have become hypercritical in the matter 
of their food, and demand a class of cooking which was 
not even attempted in the houses of the richest twenty 
years ago, — our kitchens have been in no way improved, 
neither have their appliances or equipments undergone the 
change that is necessary to keep pace with the requirements 
of the times. Dinners of sixteen or twenty, thoughtfully 
composed, are de rigueur; our tables are prettily decorated ; 
and our meyiu cards discourse of dainty fare in its native 
French. But what " nerves'' we all have to be sure ! 
Could we but raise the curtain, and examine our cook- 
rooms, and all that in them is, just before we lead the way 
to the banquet, should we not be actually dumb-foundered 
at our own audacity ? 

Setting aside the things which I have already enlarged 
upon, it is no exaggeration to say that not one Indian 
kitchen in twenty possesses a proper equipment. The 



508 OUR KITCHENS IN INDIA. 

hatterie de cidsine of people with incomes of two thousand 
rupees a month, and more, is frequently inferior to that of 
a " humble cottager in Britain," the total of whose means 
does not exceed four hundred pounds. But while the 
latter lives with consummate modesty, and thinks his 
establishment by no means equal to the strain of a dinner 
party of six, the former sits down, invites five-and-twenty 
people with a light heart, and expects everything to be of 
the best ! 

The nakedness of the land is easily discovered at the 
auctions of our highest officials, where the contrast between 
the " furniture principally by Deschamps" in the drawing- 
room, and the " few useful kitchen sundries" in the back 
verandah, is often very striking. 

The loan system is also eloquent of the inefficient equip- 
ments of our neighbours. To meet the culinary wants of 
a dinner party at Robsons', the Dobsons' ice-pail, fish- 
kettle, and sieves, are requisitioned ; and vice versa, when 
the Dobsons invite their friends, the Robsons' kitchen is 
pillaged to the extent of a border mould, a ham boiler, and 
the pastry cutters. 

I need say no more about equipment's : those who are 
interested in the matter will find a list of kitchen neces- 
saries at page 21. 

Having, I hope, satisfactorily demonstrated that a kitch- 
en range should surely find a place in the category of 
things to be " devoutly wished for" by all w^ho take any 
interest in their cuisine, let me now point out a few of the 
advantages to be derived from the use of one. 

After having once set up a good range, the purchaser 
ought, in the first place, to experience a marked diminu- 
tion in his fuel account. The native cook's objection " too 
much firewood taking" is, let me observe, a downright 
perversion of fact. If properly understood, and utilized 



OUR KITCHENS IN INDIA. 509 

to its full extent, the Englisli range, with its one fire, must 
surely consume less fuel than do the numerous open fires 
in an Indian cook-room. This is self-evident. According 
to the method that is followed in the latter system, a 
separate fire is required for each thing : — for the bath 
water, the kettle, the oven, the sauce and stew-pans, &c., 
&c. A range provided with a hot-plate, an oven, and a 
boiler, supplies with its one fire all these wants at once. 
Vessels, the contents of which require rapid boiling, are 
placed over the fire-hole, while things needing slow treat- 
ment, like soups, stews, &c., find a place upon the hot- 
plate, or flat surface of the range. The oven is, of course, 
always kept hot, and the boiler, if correctly filled, must 
contain an unceasing supply of hot water. If however 
these opportunities of economy be neglected, and if the 
cook be permitted to make up little fires, in addition to 
that of the range, here and there in the kitchen in his 
native fashion, the saving in fuel will, I grant, be small. 

I know that the " Duff's cooking ranges," which are set 
up for the use of British soldiers in the barracks of this 
Presidency, are generally condemned by the men as re- 
quiring too much wood. But then they are not utilized 
in a way by which economy is attainable. T. Atkins re- 
quires no soup ; he is not particular regarding the tender- 
ness of the stew he eats ; and he rarely wants hot water. 
He finds the oven alone necessary, for " Jack," the barrack 
cook-boy, can use the chatty, the grid-iron, or the frying- 
pan, in the verandah, over a small charcoal fire, with 
sufficient cleverness to satisfy his many masters. Yet the 
ranges in the hospital kitchens are thoroughly appreciated. 
Hot water is in constant requisition there, soup must be 
made daily, and meat has to be very carefully cooked. 
In order, then, to find English ranges economical as fuel 
consumers, people who buy them must take care that they 
are turned to their proper and full account. 

55 



610 OUR KITCHENS IN INDIA. 

The siiiierior quality of the food cooked -with a perfect 
appliance of this kind when compared with tlie best results 
obtainable by the native system, is another strong recom- 
mendation in favour of the range. Take one item of 
daily consumption — our souj). It is not exaggeration to 
say that, as a general rule, the native cook takes nearly 
double the amount of meat and bone necessary to produce 
this article of food. His doing so may be attributed, of 
course, in a gi'cat measure to ignorance ; but he can also 
plead as an excuse the want of a proper kitchen equipment. 
His practice, if left to himself, has been explained at page 
41. Now, independently of the ignorance there exposed 
of the elementaiy principles of soup-making, observe the 
wanton wastefulness of fuel. 

The extraction of the nutritive elements of meat and 
bone requu-es, we all know, that slow process of cookery 
called simmering — a process as readily canned out with an 
English range, as it is almost impossible with the open 
brick and mud fire-places of the cook-room. At least, it 
stands to reason that — be the tunny-cuich never so careful 
— the low fire, at an even degree of temperature, which 
simmering requires, can scarcely be maintained for hours 
together by the eye and hand alone. 

With a range in oui- kitchen, therefore, all we should 
have to do would be to explain the simmering system, and 
point out how easily it can be managed. Then, as soon as 
the native cook discovered that all that was necessary was 
to pull his soup kettle so many inches back upon the hot- 
plate, he would do so, for the new plan would not interfere 
with his customary absence for "rice." In the end wo 
should get a soup of superior quality extracted from about 
half the quantity of meat that we formerly issued. 

In like manner all dishes requiring slow cookery, hashes, 
stews, sauces, — even our curries, which are often sent up 
tough from being too quickly cooked,— would be easily 



OUR KITCHENS IN INDIA. 511 

prepared, and certainly be far more digestible. The 
cleanliness of the system need not be dwelt upon, smoke 
would become a thing unknown, and ashes could no longer 
be wafted by every breeze into our food. 

With so much to be said in favour of the kitchen range, 
it seems strange that its cost should be considered pro- 
hibitive by so many well-to-do people in India. If pro- 
perly used the economies it effects must, in the end, repay 
its purchase, while it ought to be at all times a very sale- 
able article. Why, I repeat, should we hesitate to provide 
ourselves in India with an appliance that in England is 
regarded by people of ordinary respectability as a common 
necessary of life ? 

Ingenious and painstaking persons who hesitate to go to 
the expense of an English range may, as I said before, 
effect a material improvement in their kitchen system by 
putting together a fire-place upon home principles. I know 
of a case in which an experiment of this kind has been 
crowned with success. The method followed may be briefly 
described as follows : — 

A fire grate was first contrived by iron bars in the style 
of a cresset, rectangular in shape, and supported on four 
iron props ; it was made the full length and height of 
an English kitchen grate, but one-third less deep at back. 
Embedded in masonry on one side of this fire grate was 
an iron bazar -made boiler ; the side of it nearest the fire 
had no masonry, and it fitted closely to the iron bars. The 
boiler was furnished with a brass tap. On the other side 
of the grate, set firmly in masonry, with its side towards 
the fire exposed, and with a close fitting door was a bazar- 
made iron oven. The props of the cresset fire-place were 
set in masonry and cemented ; they were sufficiently long 
to sustain the fire about the average height from the 
ground that kitchen fires are fitted in England. Over the 
top of the fire a flat sheet of iron connected the surface of 



512 OUR KITCHENS IN INDIA. 

the oven with that of the boiler, forming a very fair hot- 
plate. This iron sheet was movable at pleasure. The 
tojDmost outer bar of the cresset was also movable to allow 
a space for the admission of fuel when the hot-plate was 
fixed. The smoke was made to pass into a flue contrived 
with a few feet of readj-made stove piping, which passed 
through the wall of the kitchen at the back of the fire 
grate, and was then led up the wall to the roof. 

But by far the best thing introduced in this locally de- 
signed kitchen was an English roasting "jack." The 
" jack" itself was imported from home at a cost of half 
a sovereign ; the fire screen, and dripping pan were 
made by the bazar tinman ; the " jack" was hung from a 
beam fixed in the wall at a convenient height above the fire 
grate. Every joint was in this manner roasted more Anrjlico. 
Dripping, a thing previously unknown in the establish- 
ment, became a highly valued commodity ; and the meat 
was invariably sent up full of gravy, and with that crisp 
browning that can only be obtained by carefully roasting. 
A little more charcoal was used in the "jack" system than 
in the old way with the spit, but the expense was more 
than balanced by the dripping gained, the good gravy, and 
the additional juiciness of the meat. Charcoal was used 
for roasting work, and good dry wood was found suflScient 
for soups, and all common boiling operations, when no 
roasting was needed. The strange thing was that both 
the butler and the cook were as delighted with the innova- 
tion as children with a new toy. I hope that this may 
encourage some of my readers to carry out a similar 
scheme. 

I have spoken of the American cooking stoves fed by 
mineral oil, in Chapter XXX. The popularity of these 
very excellent domestic articles is increasing daily, and I 
need scarcely point out their value in the reformed kitchen 
system that I have endeavoured to discuss. One of them 



OVR KITCHENS IN INDIA. 513 

could, for instance, find a place in the indoor " working- 
room" I have recommended, and provide a handy little 
kitchen for all delicate operations, especially for fancy 
baking. 

Finally : with a range (if possible), and with an ar- 
rangement, such as I have tried to describe, giving us a 
clean, nicely equipped room for the preparation of our 
food, and a kitchen, entirely separated from godowns and 
stabling, easily accessible from the house, and conse- 
quently continually subject to scrutiny and wholesome 
discipline, I think that the back-bone of the evils I have 
spoken of would be broken, ladies would find the super- 
vision of their domestic economy a pleasure rather than 
a penance, and we should be able to congratulate our- 
selves upon having really laid the foundation-stone of true 
reform at last.
