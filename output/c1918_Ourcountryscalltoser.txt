This little book is the outgrowth of a series of efforts not only to 
supply pupils and parents with the information necessary to an intelli- 
gent understanding of some of our great national needs, but also to 
make clear to them that real service and patriotism mean unselfishness, 
sacrifices freely made, and deeds actually done at home in civilian life as 
well as at the front in the death-struggle for Democracy. 

Early in this school year an attempt was made in the Des Moines 
Public Schools to accomplish these ends by supplying teachers with 
Government pamphlets and lesson plans. This method, however, proved 
unsatisfactory because of the constant difficulty encountered in securing 
and distributing the pamphlets, the confusion resulting from the in- 
clusion in them of a large amount of technical subject matter, and in 
addition to these, one of the most important of all reasons, viz., the 
failure to send into the home a book sufficiently attractive, interesting, 
and helpful that it would stir parents as well as pupils to action. This, 
then, is the keynote of the book : A recognition of one's personal obliga- 
tion to his country which ends in action. 

The great world crisis has brought to the consciousness of educators 
with greater force than ever before the principle that courses of study 
should not be fixed by tradition, but that school curricula must be sensi- 
tive to and determined by the most important needs of the present and 
future social order. This book is therefore based upon the conviction 
that the traditional activities of the school must yield to the new and 
more vital demands by giving up part of the time formerly allotted to 
them. The author recommends that a daily period of not less than 25 
minutes in the grades and an equivalent amount of time each week in 
the high school be set aside as a Service Period, in which the activities 
suggested in this book may be discussed, planned, and, wherever possi- 
ble, performed in the classroom. Those which cannot be done in the 
classroom should be followed up by the teachers, who after all are the 
most influential and therefore the most responsible agents for the 
development of good citizenship. 

Such a period, holding as it should a definite place on the regular 
program of the school, and designed for the purpose of causing pupils 
to think and work intelligently and unselfishly for others will do much 
to develop among them a clear conception of the rapidly increasing 
interdependence of modern society. It will be more effective than any 
other period in bringing the boys ;.nd girls of today the adult citizens 
of tomorrow into a full realization of the fact, that their destinies are 
unavoidably bound up with t-be fortunes of tlx'ii rollows ; that their 
future happiness is as dependent upon tne happiness Of others as upon 
their own individual achievements. The result will be a real conserva- 
tion of resources, a stronger nation-wide morale, and the development 
of an unwavering determination to stand together and fight for Democ- 
racy to the end. 

As stated above, the book has been prepared for the purpose of 
informing and influencing parents as well as pupils. It should, there- 
fore, be used in as many grades as possible. In Des Moines each pupil 
from the kindergarten through the high school received a copy. In the 
lowest grades, where it can not be studied, teachers have a series of 
lessons on the content of the book, direct the children's attention to

some of the pictures while discussing certain points, ask the pupils to 
insert a book mark at a particular page, and request them to have their 
parents read up to that place in the evening. In addition to this pro- 
cedure there are, of course, many other exercises in the form of 
dramatizations, dialogues, songs, etc., that add much enthusiasm as 
well as seriousness. In the intermediate and upper grades, and in the 
high school the pupils eagerly study the book as a text; bring into the 
class discussion their own interpretations and experiences and infor- 
mation gleaned from available reference material ; make and compare 
the various records suggested; write patriotic compositions and plays; 
carry into the home and into general practice the suggestions in the 
book, etc. In all grades the pupils are daily doing Red Cross work; 
buying Thrift Stamps and War Savings Stamps; discussing conserva- 
tion, gardening, the value of economy, and the evil of waste. 

Aside from the exercises definitely arranged for, the material on 
every page furnishes the basis for valuable discussion which may be 
so handled as to secure practical action among the pupils. For example 
the statement on page 18 "Breadstuff s are wasted by careless storing 
of cereals (insects destroy flour and meal)" will suggest such questions 
as these: What kind of flour or meal have you ever seen destroyed by 
careless storing? Where was it stored? What destroyed it? How 
might it have been saved? etc. Again, on page 33 the question 
is asked, "How many teaspoonfuls of sugar do you think you eat each 
day?" Extend this by asking several pupils individually to tell for 
each meal in the day how many teaspoonfuls they generally use. Ask 
them to estimate the amount used in pie, cake, jelly, ice cream, candy, 
etc., that they eat and add this to the total amount which they put in 
cereals, cocoa, coffee or tea, fruit, etc. Another illustration of these 
numerous opportunities is found on page 98 where reference is made to 
the lack of patriotism shown in purchasing luxuries and spending lav- 
ishly on clothing. All through this section on Thrift, as elsewhere in the 
book, the teacher should capitalize the opportunity to impress the value 
of the simple life, the dignity of honest labor, and the evil of extrava- 
gance and idleness. 

The author is deeply grateful for the generous help received from 
many people and organizations, H.e.is^ especially indebted to the Com- 
mittee on Public Infoi-matton,". he ; Ajnerlcan Red Cross, the United

Our Country's Call to Service 




A PLACE FOR ALL IN THE ARMY OF SERVICE 
The soldier and the sailor serve by fighting for Democracy. 

The doctor and the nurse serve by caring for the wounded. 

The miner, the mechanic, and the farmer serve by supplying 
coal, ships, munitions, food, etc., for carrying on the war. 

The business and the professional man, in fact all of us, serve 
by supplying money. 

The housekeeper and the cook serve by saving food and fuel. 

The teacher serves by training boys and girls to become good 
citizens. 

Every patriotic American can serve by being loyal by work- 
ing, saving, giving. 



How can every ~boy and girl join the ranks of the 
great American Army of Service? This book tells you. 



What Service Means 1 

A CATECHISM OF SERVICE 
Question: What is patriotism? 

Answer : Patriotism is love of one 's country, the desire to 
serve one's country. 

Question : What are some of the most important ways in which 
American boys and girls can serve their country 
now? 

Answer: By producing and conserving food, by saving fuel, 
by avoiding waste, by investing money in War Sav- 
ings Stamps and Liberty Bonds, by joining the Red 
Cross, by giving money and service to all organi- 
zations that are helping to win the war. 

Question : How can they help in the production of food ? 

Answer: By planting and caring for gardens at home or on 
vacant lots. They thus increase the food supply. 

Question: What is meant by conservation of food? 

Answer: Conservation means no waste. It also means that 
we must not eat more than we really need. 

Question: Why must we conserve food? 

Answer: Because our soldiers in France and our Allies de- 
pend on us for food. They are doing the fighting, 
the suffering, and the dying. We must send food. 

Question: What food is it most necessary to conserve? 
Answer: Wheat, meat, fats, and sugar. 
Question: Why, should we save wheat? 

Answer: Because wheat bread is an energy food. The men 
on the firing line must be well nourished. Wheat 
can be shipped better than corn. 

Question : Why should we save meat and fats ? 

Answer: Because they are a necessity for soldiers, who do 
hard manual labor. Our allies cannot produce live 
stock because of lack of feed. Then too fats are 
needed for explosives. 

Question : Why should we save sugar ? 

Answer: Because sugar furnishes physical and mental energy. 
The men on the front need sugar more than we do. 



Our Country's Call to Service 
A CALL FROM THE U. S. FOOD ADMINISTRATION 




We are at war. The path 
of duty lies clearly defined 
before us. We must follow 
it to the end; we may not 
turn back, save at the price 
of national honor and the 
loss of national and individ- 
ual freedom. We must drink 
to the last bitter dregs the 
cup that we could not put 
from us. Humanity, patri- 
otism, self - preservation, 
honor urge us onward to the 
successful completion of the 
task that shall for all time 
rid the world of the danger 
overshadowing it and make 
it safe for democracy. 

Our Allies are confronted 
with the grim specter of star- 
vation and if for no other 
reason they must be fed in 
our own defense. If they 
have to yield to Germany because of hunger, America alone 
will have to shoulder the burden of winning the world war. 
And so to save our Allies and their liberty and our own, we 
have pledged our youth, our wealth, our all. 

An army ill-fed cannot fight; people ill-nourished cannot 
maintain their armies; if the women and children cry for 
bread, the soldiers lose heart. If the bread line is lowered, 
the battle line breaks. 

You would give your life for your country. You would 
scorn an American whose patriotism ended with waving flags, 
cheering the troops, and standing up when the band plays. 
You want to serve your country. Are you willing to do what 
your government asks? Are you so comfortably fixed that 
you can afford to eat what you please? Ah, but you can't 
afford to eat what your country needs. 



Herbert Hoover 
U. S. Food Administrator 



A Call from the U. S. Food Administration 9 

If you have given a son or brother or husband to fight ; if 
your wife or daughter or sister is nursing at the front ; if you 
have subscribed for Liberty Bonds or to the Red Cross ; if you 
have given aid to war orphans or cripples ; if in doing all these 
things you think you have done your share, know the grim 
truth : 

All the blood, all the heroism, all the money and munitions 
in the world will not win this war unless our Allies and the 
armies behind them are fed. 

They will not be fed unless we take care ; indeed, if we are 
not prudent we, too, shall go hungry. Protect our supplies, 
then, that they may be fed, that your sacrifice of life and 
money be not in vain. 

Lest "ve lose the Great Cause, stand guard, each day, in 
your home, over your supply of 

WHEAT, MEAT, FATS, SUGAR, MILK 

Use here the foods that we have to spare so we will be 
able to supply the needs "over there.' 

Your task in this war is to guard food for the soldiers 
and home workers of our Allies. They are fighting for YOU ! 

You can release shiploads of wheat for these fighters and 
workers by using less wheat flour in your homes and by using 
more corn meal, by wasting not a crust or crumb of white 
bread. 

By eating less beef, mutton, and pork, and by eating more 
fresh and preserved or dried vegetables and fish, our supply 
of meat animals will do for us and our Allies. 

Likewise you are needed to stand guard and see that there 
is no waste in the world's supply of fats, sugar, and milk in 
your homes. They are becoming scarcer. As they do, then 
we ourselves and our brothers on the firing lines and our sisters 
in the fields and munition factories will suffer. 

Three times a day at each meal think of America's 
glorious privilege : To feed the world while it fights its way 
to freedom. Then remember that you are standing guard, 
that the opportunity to win this war for humanity is yours.

face each other on the battle fronts. 
The fundamental thing to be 
proved is which shall prevail in 
the world. Unless we can make 
our ways f living more effective 
than those of autocracy , we must 
yield to its ruthless sway. One 
system or the other will command 
civilization in the next stage of 
the world. Which shall it be?

12 Our Country's Call to Service 

OUR ALLIES WILL STAKVE IF WE DO NOT HELP 

Because: 

1. Millions of men have gone from farm to battle front. 

Their places on the farm have been only partially filled by unskilled 
labor, crippled soldiers, women, and lazy prisoners. 

2. On account of unfavorable weather conditions 1916 was one 
of the worst seasons in agricultural history. 

Little rainfall, droughts, hurricanes, late spring, and early frosts 
greatly decreased the amount of food produced. The following 
figures show the decrease in the U. S. wheat crop in 1916: 

1915 , 1,025,801,000 bushels 

1916 639,886,000 bushels 

Although the 1917 crop was a good one, it could not offset the short- 
age of 1916. 

3. The German submarines have sunk hundreds of boats filled 
with thousands of tons of food. 

4. The German submarines have also destroyed thousands of 
tons of fertilizers that were being shipped to England, 
France, Italy, and Belgium. 

For many years these countries .have depended on imported fertiliz- 
ers to enrich the soil so that it would produce more food. Since the 
war began the producing power of the soil in these countries has 
been greatly lowered through lack of these fertilizers. 

5. Nearly all of Belgium, Serbia, and Rcumania, and much of 
Northern France are now in the possession of the Germans. 

The loss of this great fertile region has taken away from our allies 
the food that these sections have always produced. 

6. Thousands of acres of land in France, Italy, and England 
are occupied by millions of soldiers and great cantonments. 

7. Constant shell fire and the murderous bombs dropped from 
German airplanes have made it dangerous and difficult for 
the people of France, especially the. women and children, to 
cultivate the soil for several miles behind the trenches. 
Many of the courageous and loyal women of France, whose husbands 
are either dead or are at the front, work in the fields at night so 
that the Germans in airplanes cannot see them. 



Why the World Is Short of Food 13 

OUR WESTERN ALLIES DEPEND ON US FOR FOOD 

Before the war they imported millions of tons of food 
every year. Most of this food came from : 

RUSSIA. The Turks and Germans have made it almost 

impossible to import grain from Russia. Tell 
the reason. 

BULGARIA. Now an enemy. 

possession of the enemies. 



\ 



AUSTRALIA 1 ^ e ^ s ^ ailce from these countries to England or 

INDIA v France is so great that with the small number 

ARGENTINA ) ^ S ^P S available they can send the Allies little 

food. Moreover, their surplus is not very large. 

UNITED STATES. ) These countries must send the necessary food. 
CANADA. The distance is by far the shortest and the route 

is the best protected from submarines and raid- 

ers. See map on page 14. 

In normal times before the war, England, Ireland, France, 
Italy, and Belgium were to a large degree dependent upon 
imports for their food supplies. Every year they imported 
over 750,000,000 bushels of grain and vast quantities of animal 
and fat products. Much of their grain came from Russia, 
Roumania, Serbia, and Bulgaria. But a study of the map in 
your geography will show you that our Western Allies can- 
not secure wheat from Russia because shipment through the 
Black Sea and the Dardanelles is impossible, since these waters 
are controlled by the Turks. Shipping through the Baltic and 
North Seas is cut off by the Germans. The only course that 
might be traveled is from a northern port in Russia through 
the Arctic Ocean and around Norway. Lack of railroads in 
Russia, the shortage of ships, and the cold climate make this 
route too difficult and slow. 

Our enemies have cut off the supplies from Bulgaria, 
Serbia, and Roumania. The present enormous demand for 
ships necessary in the transportation of soldiers, munitions, 
and the thousands of tons of equipment required in modern 
warfare, combined with the shortage of vessels resulting from 
the destruction by submarines, makes it impossible to send food 
by the long route from Australia and India. 



14 Our Country's Call to Service 







COMPARISON OF THREE ROUTES FOR SHIPPING FOOD TO THE ALLIES 

Notice in the above picture the advantage of shipping food 
from North America to our Allies. - Look up on some map of 
the world the following routes : 

From Bombay, India, to France or England, via 
Red and Mediterranean Seas, about 3,700 miles. This 
is the route used before the war. 

From Bombay, India, to France or England, around 
Cape of Good Hope, Africa, 11,000 miles. This is the 
route that must be used now. "Why ? 

From Sydney, Australia, to France or England, 
through the Panama Canal, 12,600 miles. 

From Buenos Aires, Argentina, to France, 5,200 
miles. 

From New York to France, 3,200 miles. This is 
the shortest route. 

The question of who wins this war is the question of who 
can endure the longest, and the problem of endurance, in a larg.e 
degree, is a problem of food and the ships to carry it. 



Why the World Is Short of Food 



15 



Questions and Exercises 

1. What is a concentrated food? Name several kinds. 

2. Why should we send concentrated foods to Europe? 

3. Tell why it would be foolish to ship certain foods to Europe. 

4. About how many trips do you think a vessel c^uld make from New 
York to England while another vessel is goin from Australia to 
England? 

5. Write a composition explaining why our Allies are short of food. 

6. Look again at the picture on page 10 and write a composition telling 
how you think a man who is fighting in the trenches would feel when 
he hears that his loved ones are cold and hungry. 



The meat and wheat we do not eat 
May save the great cause from defeat.

Our Country's Call to Service 



B. THE FOODS MOST NEEDED BY OUR ALLIES 

WHEAT 

Our Allies must have wheat. It is the best food to fight on. 
It is the easiest to ship. We alone can spare it to them. By 
saving just a quarter* of the wheat we ate last year, we can 
support those lighting our battles, and we can do it without 
stinting ourselves, by substituting another food just as good.

Before the war these countries imported annually from : 

1. United States ; 79,426,000 bushels 

2. Canada 112,900,000 bushels 

3. Russia, Roumania, Serbia, Bulgaria,

they will have for export to our Allies: 

9. United States 80,000,000 bu. ) _ _ nnn nnn 

10. Canada 150,000,000 bu. f 230,000,000 bushels 

11. Our Allies' Shortage 347,709,000 bushels 



Save Wheat for Our Allies 



17 



Our problem, then, as well as our duty, as is shown in the pre- 
ceding table, becomes very clear. We must, through savings and 
substitutions, conserve enough wheat so that North America can 
send at least 450,000,000 bushels to our Allies. This would re- 
quire our Allies to substitute other cereals to the amount of 
127,709,000 bushels. It means that we must reduce our con- 
sumption 220,000,000 bushels and this can be done if we do our 
bit by following the directions and suggestions given in this 
book. 

There are two ways to help send the full supply of wheat 
needed by our Allies : 

(1) Do not allow a grain of wheat to be wasted. 

(2) Reduce the amount of wheat we consume by eating 
other grains corn, barley, etc.

SERVE BY SAVING 

AN OLD FRIEND SPEAKS 

I am a slice of Bread. I measure 
three inches by two and a half, and my 
thickness is half an inch. My weight is 
exactly an ounce. I am thrown away 
once a day by thousands of people in 
America. I am the * ' bit left over. ' I am 
the slice eaten absent-mindedly when 
really I am not needed. I am the de- 
spised crust. If you collected me and my 

companions for a whole week you would find that we amounted to 
thousands of pounds of good bread. When you throw me away 
or waste me, you are helping the German submarines destroy 
food. Stop fighting for the' enemy by wasting me! ! I 




Don't Waste Wheat 



Breadstuffs Are Wasted: 

By careless storing of cereals (insects destroy flour and meal). 
By leaving flour and dough on bread bowl and board. 
By bread failures due to wrong handling and baking. 

By discarding left overs, biscuits, muffins, ends of loaves. 
(Bread crumbs may be used in many ways.) 

By undertaking, which results in bread that sours when a 
few days old. 

By improper storing of bread in damp places; this results 
in souring and molding. 



Save Wheat for Our Allies 19 



A SLICE OF BREAD 

A single slice of bread seems an unimportant thing. 
In many households one or more slices of bread daily 
are thrown away. Sometimes stale quarter or half loaves 
are thrown out. Yet one good-sized slice of bread weighs 
an ounce. It contains almost three-fourths of an ounce 
of flour. 

If every one of the country's 20,000,000 homes 
wastes on the average only one such slice of bread a 
day, the country is throwing away daily over 14,000,000 
ounces of flour over 875,000 pounds, or enough flour 
for over a million 1-pound loaves a day. For a full 
year at this rate there would be a waste of over 319,- 
000,000 pounds of flour 1,500,000 barrels enough to 
make 365,000,000 loaves of bread. 

As it takes 4^ bushels of wheat to make a barrel of 
ordinary flour, this waste would represent the flour 
from over 7,000,000 bushels of wheat. 

Fourteen and nine-tenths bushels of wheat on the 
average are raised per acre. It would take the wheat 
of some 470,000 acres just to provide a single slice of 
bread to be wasted daily in every home. 

To produce this much flour calls for an army of 
farmers, railway men, flour-mill people. To get the 
flour to the consumer calls for many freight cars and 
the use of many tons of coal. 

But, some, one says, a full slice of bread is not wasted 
every day in every home. Very well make it a daily 
slice for every 4 or every 10 or every 30 homes make 
it a weekly or a monthly slice in every home or make 
the wasted slice thinner. The waste of flour is still 
altogether too great to be allowed when wheat is scarce. 

Any waste of bread is inexcusable when there are 
so many ways of using stale bread to cook delicious 
dishes.

Do You KNOW CORN MEAL ? 

, 

Corn! It isn't one food, it's a dozen. It's a cereal. It's a 
vegetable. It's a bread. It's a dessert. It's nutritious; more 
food value in it dollar for dollar than meat, eggs, or most 
vegetables. Best of all it's plentiful. 

Its use means service to your Country and a nourishing 
food for you. A cup of corn meal gives even more fuel to your 
body than a cup of wheat flour. Try corn bread and see how 
good it is. You will wonder why you didn't use it before the 
war. (See Recipes, pages 54-58.) 

Heap high the farmer's wintry hoard I 

Heap high the golden corn! 
No richer gift has Autumn poured 

From out her lavish horn! 

Let other lands, exulting, glean 
. The apple from the pine, 
The orange from its glossy green, 
The cluster from the vine; 

But let the good old crop adorn 

The hills our fathers trod; 
Still let us, for his golden corn, 

Send up our thanks to God!

HOW WE MAY HELP 

1. By observing two wheatless days a week Monday and 
Wednesday and one wheatless meal each other day in 
the week. (This means 11 wheatless meals a week. Wheat- 
less means no ivheat products bread, biscuit, crackers, 
pastry. Remember that graham flour is made of wheat.) 

2. In all cooking use substitutes for wheat as much as pos- 
sible. 

3. Eat "Victory Bread' as eagerly as you expect the boys 
in khaki to go "over the top.' 

4. Cut the loaf at the table so that none will be left to dry. 

5. Do not allow bread to become stale. 

6. Do not use toast as a garnish or serve food on toast. 

7. If there are bits of bread left, dry and grind or pound, 
using the crumbs in place of flour. 

8. Do not often use breakfast cereals made of wheat. 

9. If you use macaroni, spaghetti, or any Italian paste or noo- 
dles, remember that it is made of wheat and do not serve 
bread at the same meal. 

10. Use cornstarch or rice flour for thickening sauces and 
gravies and in puddings. (Use half as much as you would 
of flour.) 

11. Remember Bread made of mixed flours is better body- 
building material than that made from one grain alone.

MEATS 

Our Allies need meat. Their herds are rapidly decreasing, 
and shipments from Australia, South America, and continental 
countries have been interfered with, throwing the burden on 
North America, the nearest market. The following table shows 
the decrease in herds since 1914: 

Decrease Decrease in

Cattle 8,420,000 26,750,000

Hogs 7,100,000 31,600,000 

Total 33,020,000 92,350,000 

Our meat exports for the year ending June 30, 1916, ex- 
ceeded the average before the war by almost a billion pounds. 
We shall need to send our Allies even more next year. We also 
need to send large quantities to our own army. Our soldiers 
need more meat now because many who ate meat sparingly when 
in private life need it twice daily as they are doing hard physical 
work. 

Do You KNOW 

1. That people who are not doing hard manual labor are gen- 
erally better in health if they eat less meat? 

2. That we eat more meat than our Allies? The following 
table gives the number of pounds per person each month : 

United States England France 

Meat 12.5 10.5 8.5 

Fat 3.4 2.2 3.6 

If our allies can maintain normal physical conditions on 
smaller portions than we use, is not our duty clear? Out of our 
abundance it is our duty and honor to save for democracy's 
sake. 

3. That eggs, cheese, and milk are good substitutes for meat 9 

4. That beans have nearly the same food value as meat ? 

5. That one ounce of meat thrown away daily by each one of 
the 20,000,000 families in this country will amount to 
1,250,000 pounds? 

6. That this amount of meat at 25c a pound would amount to 
$312,500 a day?

An Ounce of Meat 

An ounce of edible meat- 
le-an meat, fat and lean, suet or 
fat trimmed from steak, chop, 
or roast seems hardly worth 
saving. 

Many households take just 
this view of the matter do not 
trouble to put such a scrap into 
the ice box or soup pot do not bother to save for cook- 
ery a spoonful or two of drippings or a tiny bit of suet 
or fat. 

Yet if every one of our 20,000,000 American fam- 
ilies wastes each day only 1 ounce of edible meat or 
fat, it means a daily waste of 1,250,000 .pounds of ani- 
mal food 456,000,000 pounds of valuable animal food 
a year. 

At average dressed weights, it would take the gross 
weight of over 875,000 steers to equal the amount of 
meat or fat thrown into the garbage pail or kitchen 
sink. It takes millions of tons of feed and hay, the 
grass from vast pastures, and the labor of armies of 
cattlemen and butchers to provide the meat thus wasted. 

But every household doesn't waste an ounce of meat 
or fat every day. Very well; make it one out of a 
hundred families, but keep in mind that all meat 
allowed to spoil and all meat and fat spoiled by im- 
proper cooking, scorching, or burning, must be counted 
as waste. Such waste still would be unendurable when 
meat is scarce and when fat is of such vital food im- 
portance to many nations. 

Waste of meat or fat is inexcusable. Every bit of 
lean meat can be used in soups, stews, or in combination 

with cereals; every spoonful of fat can be employed 
in cookery; every bit of drippirigs and gravy can be 
saved and used to add flavor and nourishment to other 
dishes.

WHY WE MUST SAVE FATS 

We need to save fat and pork products for our Allies. Their 
hogs are decreasing and we must send them more than ever 
before. Last year we sent our Allies three times as much but- 
ter as we used to send them. 

We use fat in many ways in the manufacture of things 
needed to win the war (glycerine, dynamite, smokeless powder, 
lubricants, etc.). Therefore as a nation we can not afford to go 
on wasting even if we are willing to be extravagant personally.

A Pat of Butter 

One pat or serving of butter is a lit- 
l tle thing there are about 64 of them 
in a pound. 

In many households the butter left on the plates 
probably would equal one pat, or one-fourth of an 
ounce, daily scraped off into the garbage pail or washed 
off in the dish pan. 

But if every one of our 20,000,000 households should 
waste one-fourth of an ounce of butter daily on the 
average, it would mean 312,500 pounds a day 114,- 
062,500 pounds a year. 

To make this butter would take 265,261,560 gallons 
of milk or the product of over half a million cows. 

But butter isn't eaten or wasted in every home, 
some one objects. Very well. Say only 1 in 100 homes 
wastes even a pat of butter a day over 1,000,000 
pounds wasted. Even this is inexcusable when butter 
is so valuable a food and when every bit of butter left 
on a plate is so useful in cookery. 

We are the greatest fat wasters in the world. 



28 Our Country's Call to Service 

How TO SAVE FATS 

1. Do not serve fat to one who will leave it on his plate. 

2. Reduce use of fried foods boil, broil, and bake. 

3. Save drippings, suet, and chicken fat. 

4. Save butter. Save the small amounts of butter left on plates. 
Scrape it into a "butter cup' ' kept for that purpose. Use it

and bacon fat are worth their weight in gold. Use these in 
any cooking. Use corn oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, and olive 
oil for cooking and frying as well as in salad dressings. 







Fat from Sausages Is Good for Cooking 

MAKE SOAP OF FAT UNFIT FOR COOKING 

Use lye made by letting water drip slowly through wood 
ashes, or buy lye in cans. Use porcelain or enamel dish. Dis- 
solve 1 can lye in 1 quart cold water. Melt 5 pounds fat in 
separate dish. Strain through 2 thicknesses cheese cloth. Cool 
till lukewarm. Add dissolved, cooled lye. Stir until mixture 
is like porridge. Pour quickly into shallow pasteboard boxes 
or dripping pan. When cool, crease into cakes. Cut when 
nearly cold. Why not have a community soap making club? 

MEAT TRIMMINGS ARE VALUABLE 

When you buy meat get the trimmings, fry out the fat, and 

use it in cooking. 

DON'T WASTE ANY SOAP 

Save pieces of soap too small to handle, melt them in a little 
water over a slow fire, use for washing dishes or boiling clothes.

REMEMBER THAT OUR SUPPLY OF BUTTER DEPENDS ON OUR 

SUPPLY OF MILK 



ONE HALF CUP OF MILK 

Half a cup of milk whole, skimmed, or sour a 
seemingly trifling matter hardly worth the trouble 
to keep or use. 

In many households quite a little milk is wasted 
left uncovered in glasses regarded as useless because 
the cream has been skimmed off allowed to sour 
poured down the sink or thrown out. 

Now if every hpme there are 20,000,000 of them 
should waste on the average one-half cup daily, it 
would mean a waste of 2,500,000 quarts daily 912,- 
500,000 quarts a year the total product of more than 
400,000 cows. 

It takes hundreds of acres of grass and tons of 
grain to make that much milk and an army of people 
to produce and deliver it. 

But every household doesn't waste a half cup of 
milk a day. Well, say that one-half cup is wasted in 
only one out of a hundred homes. Even this is an in- 
excusable waste when milk is so nourishing when skim 
milk can.be used in bread making or for cottage cheese. 



Milk Is Wasted : 

By careless handling. 

By discarding buttermilk (use for cookery and beverages) 
By discarding separated milk (use for cheese and cookery). 
By discarding skim milk (use for cheese and cookery). 
By discarding sour milk (use for cheese and cookery). 
By discarding whey (use in bread making).

Eat to Live Don't Live to Eat 





Needs /ie ^fore Sugar, You or the Soldier? 
WHY SUGAE IS IMPOETANT 

Why do we eat sugar? You will no doubt say immediately, 
' Because it flavors our food. ' This is one of the chief reasons 
for its use and no doubt the reason for its excessive use, but the 
importance of sugar in our diet is to satisfy bodily needs. 

Certain Italian troops, counted the best marchers in Europe, 
keep themselves fresh by eating loaf sugar. Several years ago 
the experiment of serving out rations of sugar to troops on the 
march was tried in France. The energy of the soldiers was so 
greatly increased that, ever since, sugar has been regarded as 
an important article in the French military diet. 

Americans have come to consider a large amount of sugar 
as a necessity of life, but while it makes our food more palat- 
able, the excessive use of sugar is not only extravagant but 
may cause digestive disturbances. The amount one can eat 
depends on the amount of his muscular activity and the amount 
of other foods in the diet. 

Under special conditions of muscular exertion such as our 
soldiers are called upon to meet, the energy they get from sugar 
becomes available to the body more rapidly than energy from 
other food. It has also been found that an increase of sugar 
in the diet, when not too great, lessens or delays fatigue and 
increases working power; hence a soldier's need of it. 



32 Our Country's Call to Service 

WHY WE NEED TO SAVE 

The shortage of sugar in our country at present is due to 
two causes : 

(1) The failure of the American public to reduce their 
consumption of sugar. 

(2) The unusual exports made to France that we might 
maintain its ration which has been reduced to 6 
ounces per week per person. 

Before the war the Allies produced much of their own 
sugar and purchased the remainder from Germany. The 
amount imported from the Western Hemisphere was 300,000 
tons annually. This year they have imported 1,400,000 tons. 
Next year they will need more. 

Mr. Hoover warns us: 

"It is our stern duty to feed our Allies, to maintain their 
health and strength at any cost to ourselves. There has not 
been, nor will there be, as we see it, enough sugar for even their 
present meager and depressing ration unless they send ships 
to remote markets for it. If we in our greed and gluttony force 
them either to further reduce their ration or to send these 
ships, we will have done damage to our abilities to win the 



war." 



DOES THIS MEAN You? 



In a certain American city a lady stopped in a drug store 
for a light lunch at noon. She was shocked to find a large 
number of school children from homes where every need in the 
way of wholesome food was met, spending lavishly for candy. 
On inquiring of the druggist as to the effect of the war in 
decreasing the amount of candy sold, she was told that there 
had been no decrease. 

Is YOUNG AMERICA PATRIOTIC? 



Perhaps you have not been told that eating less candy is 
one way of showing patriotism.

The people of the United States have been eating 4 ounces

34 Our Country's Call to Service 

HOW WE CAN SAVE SUGAR 

1. Use less in cocoa, coffee, tea. Stir it until it is dissolved. 

2. Try cooking breakfast food with chopped figs, dates, 
or raisins. You will not need to add any sugar at the table. 

3. Use molasses, honey, or corn syrups for sweetening. 

4. Use fresh fruits for desserts in place of rich pastries and 
sweet puddings. 

5. Use more dried fruits. They are less expensive and 
just as nutritious as the fresh. "Wash in hot water. Soak over 
night. Simmer in the water in which they were soaked. The 
long, slow cooking is necessary to develop a rich flavor. Prunes 
need almost no sugar. 

6. Cut down the use of cake. Bake x cookies instead. 

7. Do not use frosting unless you can make it without 
sugar. Try spreading the top and sides thinly with jelly and 
sprinkling with grated cocoanut or finely chopped almonds if 
you must have a fancy cake. 

8. Either honey or maple -syrup may be substituted for 
sugar in boiled frosting. 

In substituting syrup for sugar, one cup of syrup is equiva- 
lent to one cup of sugar and one-fourth cup of liquid. 

9. Eat less .candy, especially the kinds made largely of 
sugar. Food Administrator Hoover makes the. following sug- 
gestions about the kinds of candy to be eaten: 

There are at least four groups of candy made from absolutely whole- 
some ingredients which are plentiful. The first includes chocolate and 
cocoa candies with centers of nuts, fruits, fruit pastes, marmalades, jams, 
and the like, especially the old-fashioned chocolate creams with the bitter 
coating, and the uncoated soft candy such as nougatines, Turkish pastes, 
and similar varieties. 

The second group includes hard boiled candies, such as lemon drops, 
stick candy, fruit tablets, peanut bars, peanut brittle, glac nuts, and the 
like, containing a large portion of corn syrup, and molasses candies. 

Marshmallows and similar candy comprise the third group, being 
made with corn syrup, corn starch, and gelatine, and only a small percent- 
age of sugar. They may be eaten plain, toasted, dipped in chocolate, or 
rolled in cocoanut. 

In the fourth' group are included gum drops, jellies, jelly beans, and 
the like.

General Directions on Food Conservation 



37 



GENERAL DIRECTIONS 

I. Two wheatless days a week (Monday and Wednesday) 
and one wheatless meal each other day in the week. Eat 
Victory bread. 

II. One meatless day a week (Tuesday). Meatless means no 
red meat: beef, pork, mutton, veal, lamb; no preserved 
meat : beef, bacon, ham, or lard. 

III. Sugar: Reduce amount eaten to 3 pounds a month- 
1% ounces a day 8 teaspoonfuls a day. Eat very little 

candy and reduce the use of sweet drinks. 

IV. Eat more of our plentiful foods: potatoes and vegetables 

of all kinds ; poultry and rabbits ; milk and cheese. 

KEEP A WASTE EECOBD 

You know that even an ounce of food wasted daily by each person 
in the United States would amount to thousands of tons of food thrown 
away. You should, therefore, do everything possible to avoid wasting 
even little crumbs of bread, pieces of butter, bits of meat, sugar, jelly, 
cheese, milk, etc., in your home. 

(1) Make a list of the foods you have seen wasted in your home, 
showing the reason why they were wasted and how they might have 
been used. Keep the list and add to it as you think of other items. 
Compare your list with those of your classmates.

WATCH YOUK KITCHEN WASTE 

A large part of the $700,000,000 estimated food waste in 
this country is good food which is allowed to get into garbage 
pails and kitchen sinks. Don't throw out any left overs that 
can be reheated or combined with other foods to make palatable 
and nourishing dishes. 

Remember: 
That every bit of uneaten cereal can be used to thicken 

soups, stews, or gravies. 

That stale bread can be used as the basis for many attractive 

meat dishes, hot breads, and desserts. 

That every ounce of skimmed milk or whole milk contains 

valuable nourishment. 

Use every drop of milk to drink or to add nourishment to cereals, 
soups, sauces, and other foods. If you do not want milk to sour, 
be sure to keep it cool, clean, and covered. Bemember, too, that 
sour milk, buttermilk, and sour cream are valuable in cookery; 
so do not waste any. Sour milk and buttermilk can be used with 
soda in making hot breads, or sour milk can be turned easily into 
cottage cheese, cream cheese, or clabber. Sour cream is a good 
shortening in making cakes and cookies and useful for salad 
dressings and gravies for meat. 

That every bit of meat and fish can be combined with cereals 
or vegetables for making meat cakes, meat or fish pies, etc., and 
is useful in adding flavor and food value to made dishes. 

That every spoonful of left-over gravy can be used in soups 
or as flavoring for meat pies, croquettes, and vegetables. 

That every bit of clean fat trimmed from meat and every 
spoonful of drippings and every bit of grease that rises when 
meat is boiled is valuable for use in cookery. 

That when meat is boiled, the water dissolves out some valu- 
able food and flavoring material. 

Save such water for soup or for use in stews or gravies, or for 
cooking vegetables. Save and keep soup stock. Every profes- 
sional cook knows that keeping a soup or stock pot is an essential 
economy. 
That valuable food and flavoring get into the water in 

which rice and many vegetables are cooked. 

Use such water for soup making if it has an agreeable flavor. 

That careless paring of potatoes or fruits often wastes as 
much as 20 per cent of their food material. 

That the outside leaves of lettuce and the tops of many 
vegetables make desirable cooked ''greens" or salads. 



Save By Using Left-Overs 39 

HOW TO USE LEFT-OVERS 

Meat 

Use left-over meat in meat pies, meat salads, meat balls, meat dump-' 
lings, hash, meat loaf, casserole dishes, creamed meat, meat and vegetable 
stews, soups, or in omelets. 

Potato 

Combine potato with meat as above. Or make potato souffles, soups, 
potato balls, potato pancakes, potato bread, potato cake, creamed pota- 
toes, fish balls. 

Bread 

Use for bread puddings, chicken or turkey dressing, soups, part of 
the flour in bread, cakes, griddle cakes, and biscuits. Dry it thoroughly 
and make crumbs to use on scalloped dishes for stuffing for peppers and 
whole canned tomatoes. 

Cake 

Use left-over cake for puddings. 

Vegetables 

Use left-over vegetables for salads, soups, chowders, in meat loaves, 
in casserole dishes, or as a garnish for a roast and other dishes or as 
creamed vegetables. 

Milk 

Use all the milk, whether whole or skimmed make soups, white 
sauces, gravies, sherbets, ice cream, custards, junket, gelatin sponges, 
and Bavarian creams. Make cottage cheese and chowders. Use it in 
scalloped dishes. Buttermilk and sour milk with soda make excellent 
quick breads, pancakes, and cakes. Milk for which there is no other 
use should go to feed chickens. 

Cheese Scraps 

Grate hard cheese and use it for macaroni dishes, sauces, and sand- 
wiches. Keep fresh cheese wrapped in a cloth dipped in vinegar and 
wrung dry. 

Give Cottage Cheese a Fair Trial 

Cottage cheese, the curd of sour milk, is one of the most important 
meat substitutes. It supplies more protein per pound than most meats 
and is considerably cheaper. Make cottage cheese sandwiches. Serve 
cottage cheese balls with salads. Combine it with chopped pimento and 
peppers and serve with salad dressing. 

For supplying protein, one pound On the basis of energy supplied, 
of cottage cheese equals: one pound of cottage cheese equals: 

1.27 pounds sirloin steak 8.33 ounces sirloin steak 

1.09 pounds round steak 11.25 ounces round steak 

1.37 pounds chuck rib beef 11.25 ounces chuck rib beef 

1.52 pounds fowl 10.75 ounces fowl 

1.46 pounds fresh ham 5.25 ounces fresh ham 

1.44 pounds smoked ham 5.0 ounces smoked ham 

1.58 pounds loin pork chop 6.0 ounces loin pork chop 

1.31 pounds hind leg of lamb 7.33 ounces hind leg of lamb 

1.37 pounds breast of veal 12.75 ounces breast of veal

HOW TO KEEP FOOD 

Heat, dirt, improper handling, flies, insects, and rats or 
mice are the greatest food wasters. 

Keep perishables cool, clean, and covered. The moment meat, 
fish, milk, and eggs are allowed to get warm they begin to spoil. 

Bacteria and germs multiply rapidly in slightly warm food, 
and quickly make it dangerous or unfit to eat. 

Keep perishable foods in the coolest, cleanest place you can 
provide, preferably in a good refrigerator or ice house, but, 
at any rate, in covered vessels suspended in the well, or in the 
coolest, clean place in your home. 

Do not keep perishable foods in a hot kitchen or pantry or 
in a sunny place a moment longer than is necessary. 

Dry cold is a better preservative than damp cold. 
The dust particles in the air carry molds and germs. 

Meat, fish, and milk are ideal breeding grounds of such 
germs. Keep your food covered so that these bacteria and 
germs will have as little chance as possible to get on your food 

Protect Pood Against Insects and Vermin 

House flies better called ''typhoid flies' -are among the 
dirtiest things that enter our homes. They fly from sewers, 
privies, and manure heaps, carrying filth on their feet, which 
they deposit on any food on which they alight. Frequently 
germs of typhoid fever are carried by flies in the filth on their 
bodies. 

Ordinary cleanliness demands that flies be kept out of our 
homes and away from our food. 

Health protection makes it essential to banish flies. Keep 
all food covered, or at least screened from these carriers of 
deadly disease and filth. Destroy flies by every possible means. 

Rats and mice destroy millions of dollars' worth of food 
and other property every year in homes or farms, and in busi- 
ness establishments. Many rats harbor the germs of bubonic 
plague. Trap and kill them. Look upon every mouse as an 
enemy to your property. 

Kill roaches and house ants. Keep weevils out of cereals. 
Keep your food where such pests cannot reach it. 
Keep household pets away from your food. 



How to Store Food 4.1 

Store Vegetables and Fruits Properly 

Don't let fresh vegetables or fruits wilt or lose their flavor 
or begin to rot because they are handled carelessly. Keep 
perishable vegetables in cool, dry, well-aired, and for most 
vegetables, dark rather than light places. 

Learn how to store potatoes, cabbages, root crops, fruits, 
and other foods so that they will keep properly for later use. 

Don't think that any place in the cellar or pantry is good 
enough to store food. 

Heat, dampness, poor ventilation, bruising, or breaking will 
rapidly make many vegetables rot, ferment, or spoil. Warmth 
and light make vegetables sprout and this lowers their quality. 

Can or Preserve Surplus Vegetables and Fruits 

.When there is a surplus of fruits or vegetables that will 
spoil if kept, cook or stew them and keep them cold and cov- 
ered for use in a day or two. 

Can or preserve all surplus food from gardens for winter 
use. In a morning's work with ordinary home utensils, you 
can put up many cans of vegetables and fruit for winter use. 
If you have no garden, watch the markets. When any fruit 
or vegetable that can be canned becomes plentiful and cheap, 
buy a quantity and can it for home use next winter. 

Avoid Losses in Cooking 

Save water in which vegetables were boiled. Make cream 
soups by using this water to thin a white sauce,, and season as 
desired. Vegetables and leaves which cannot be used for any 
other purpose can "do their bit" in the soup kettle. 

Boil potatoes in their jackets. Much valuable material lies 
close to the skin of a potato. 

Potatoes, pared before boiling, lose into the water in which 
they are cooked about one-fifth of the iron they contain ; peas 
and beans lose from one-third to two-fifths, and spinach one- 
half of the total amount present. The amount of iron in our 
foods is small. Its importance to the body is great. We 
should consume it to the greatest possible extent. To do this 
we should either steam our vegetables or use the water in which 
they are cooked. Peel potatoes after cooking.

Some Expensive Mistakes 

In Serving: 

Too large quantities placed on individual plates. 
The same amounts served to each, regardless of appetite. 
The same foods served to each, regardless of taste. 
Elaborate entertaining. 

In Eating: 

By eating more than is needed. 

By eating foods in wrong proportions. 

By eating too rapidly; less food is required if eaten slowly and chewed 

thoroughly. 

By serving one's self more food than is wanted (butter, bread, etc.). 
By eating crusts and discarding soft portion, and vice versa. 
By placing excess of sugar in cocoa, tea, coffee. (Undissolved sugar 

in cup is wasted.) 

Some Ways of Waste 

Vegetables Are Wasted: 

By careless storing. 

By taking thick parings, sometimes 20 per cent of edible portion. 

Save food by cooking in jackets. 
By discarding small sized vegetables. 
By discarding water in which vegetables are cooked. Steaming saves 

food material. 
By discarding leaves and stem (beet tops, turnip tops, outer stalks 

and leaves of celery). 
By overcooking. 
By undercooking. 

By cooking larger quantity than is needed. 
By discarding left-overs. 

Good Food of All Kinds Is Wasted: 
If it gets into the garbage pail. 
If allowed to spoil in the home. 
If ruined by careless cooking. 
If carelessly pared and trimmed. 
If too much is served at a meal. 

Food Money Is Wasted: 

By ordering by price instead of weight. 

By buying perishable foods in too large quantities. 

By buying "out of season" goods (strawberries in December). 

By buying too freely ready-to-eat foods (breakfast foods, canned 

soups). 
By buying much food that is high in price but low in food value 

(asparagus tips, oysters, pimentos, and mushrooms). 
By "living out of paper bags." 

By buying staple f'ods in small packages (corn meal, rice). 
By buying for wants rather than for needs.

46 Our Country's Call to Service 

KEEPING UP-TO-DATE 

As different conditions in the food problem arise it is neces- 
sary for the Food Administration to issue new appeals for 
economy in the use of various foods. To keep strictly -in touch 
with the wishes of the Food Administration it is very essential 
that we read carefully the daily newspapers, which furnish us 
full data concerning the work of the various departments at 
Washington. For instance, on March 23, 1918, the following 
new regulations on the consumption of wheat flour appeared : 

If we are to furnish the allies with the necessary proportion of wheat 
to maintain their war bread from now until the next harvest, and this 
is a military necessity, we must reduce our monthly consumption to 
21,000.000 bushels, as against our normal consumption of about 42,000,000 
bushels, or 50 per cent of our normal consumption. 

Reserving a margin for distribution to the army and for special 
cases leaves for general consumption approximately one and one-half 
pounds of irJicat products weekly per person. 

With improved transportation conditions we now have available a 
surplus of potatoes. We also have in the spring months a surplus of 
milk, and we have ample corn and oats for human consumption. The 
drain on rye and barley as substitutes has already greatly exhausted 
the supply of these grains. 

To effect the needed saving of wheat we are wholly dependent upon 
the voluntary assistance of the American people, and we ask that the 
following rules shall be observed: 



Householders to use not to exceed a total of 1% pounds per week of 
wheat products per person. This means not more than 1% pounds of 
victory bread containing the required percentage of substitutes and one 
pound of cooking flour, macaroni, crackers, pastry, pies, cakes, wheat 
breakfast cereals, all combined. 

There is no limit upon the use of other cereals, flours and meals, corn, 
barley, buckwheat, potato flour, etc. 

Many thousand families throughout the land are now using no wheat 
products whatever, except a very small amount for cooking purposes, 
and are doing so in perfect health and satisfaction. 

There is no reason why all of the American people who are able to 
cook in their own households cannot subsist perfectly well with the use 
of less wheat products than one and one-half pounds a week, and we 
especially ask the well-to-do households in the country to follow this 
additional program in order that we may provide the necessary mar- 
ginal supplies for those parts of the community less able to adapt them- 
selves to so large a proportion of substitutes. 

With the arrival of harvest we should be able to relax such restric- 
tions.

A THE BALANCED DIET 
Eat Something from Each of These Five Groups Every Day 

Group I Mineral Matter, Acids and Body Regulators 

FRUITS AND VEGETABLES furnish some of the material 
from which the body is made and keep its many parts working 
smoothly. They help prevent difficulties which give you head- 
aches and made you stupid. The kinds you choose depend 
upon the season, but remember that the cheaper ones are often 
as valuable as the more expensive. 

Group n Protein (Building) Foods 

MILK, EGGS, FISH, MEAT, PEAS, BEANS these help 
build up the growing body and renew used-up parts. Dried 
peas and beans make good dishes to use in place of meat part 
of the time, but don't leave out the other foods entirely. Milk 
is the most important. Buy at least a pint a day for every 
member of your family. No other food can take its place for 
children. Don't slpmp on milk. 

Group III Starchy Foods 

CEREALS Bread and breakfast foods. These foods act 
as fuel to let you do your work, much as the gasoline burning 
in an automobile engine makes the car go. And they are 
usually your cheapest fuel. Besides, they give your body some 
building material. 

Don't think that wheat bread is the only kind of cereal 
food. The Government asks us to save wheat to send abroad 
to our soldiers and the Allies. Let the North try the Southern 
corn bread and the South the oatmeal of the North. Oatmeal 
muffins are delicious. See page 55 for the recipe. 

Group IV Foods for Sugar 

SUGAR AND SYRUPS are fuel, too, and they give flavor 
to other foods. They are valuable food, but many people eat 
more of them than they need. Sweet fruits, of course, contain 
much sugar and are better for the children than candy. 

Group V Foods for Fat 

FAT is fuel Some is needed, especially by hard- working 
people. Remember that expensive fats are no better fuel than 
cheap ones. Use drippings. Don't let your butcher keep the 
trimmings from your meat. They belong to you. Children 
need some butter fat. Give it to them in plenty of whole milk 
or in butter.

MEAL PLANS 

Study your meals. Plan them for at least three days in 
advance. This helps you to buy to better advantage, gives 
variety in material and preparation. 

Ask yourself the following questions about your meal: 
Does this plan mean 

1. The use of home grown products and thus allow the rail- 
roads to be hauling supplies for the army instead of food 
for my family? 

2. The substitution of milk, cheese, eggs, fish, game, beans, 
nuts, and peas for beef, mutton, and pork? 

3. The use of barley, buckwheat, corn, oats, potatoes, and rye 
instead of wheat? 

4. Plenty of whole milk for the children? 

5. Twelve ounces of fat per adult per week and six ounces 
per child per week? The substitution of the vegetable fats 
wherever possible? 

6. The substitution of honey, molasses, corn syrup, or other 
syrup for sugar, so as to reduce the amount of sugar used 
to three pounds or less per person per month? 

7. Meals adapted to the season and pocketbook? 

8. Meals which include at least one food from each of the 
Food Groups named above? 

The following gives a day's ample nourishment: 

Breakfast 

Group I. Prunes

B WHEAT SAVING RECIPES 
SAVE THE WHEAT USE CORN AND OATS 

Make it a principle to increase the use of corn meal to the maximum. 
Pound for pound, the energy value of corn meal is equal to that of wheat 
flour. Every time corn meal is used where before we used wheat pro- 
ducts, we are helping to win the war. 

Have corn meal mush for breakfast ; add figs, dates, or other fruit, 
for variety; serve fried mush; use corn meal in quick breads, yeast 
breads, desserts. The breads are light, palatable, and capable of frequent 
use in the weekly dietary. Likewise, make the maximum use of oatmeal 
or rolled oats. Omit all wheat breakfast cereals. Use oatmeal or rolled 
oats, and secure variety through adding fruit. Use rolled oats to con- 
serve one-fourth the wheat in making muffins, rolls, and yeast-raised 
bread. 

Proportions and Directions 

All measurements are level, and flour is measured after sifting. Pro- 
portions are for Minnesota flour. 

EEAL CORN BREAD 

2 cups buttermilk % teaspoon soda 

1 egg 1 teaspoon salt 

Corn meal to make a thin batter. 

Beat egg, add buttermilk. Then sift dry ingredients, beat well and 
bake in hot oven in a thin sheet or in gem pans. 

CORN MEAL MUFFINS 

1 cup milk or water (8 ounces) 1 to 2 tablespoons sugar (%-l oz.) 
li/3 cups flour (51/3 ounces) 1 egg (2 ounces) 

2/3 cup corn meal (3^ ounces) 4 teaspoons baking powder (% oz.) 

1 to 2 tablespoons fat (^-1 ounce) % teaspoon salt (* ounce) 

Method I: Mix milk, egg, and melted fat, and add dry ingredients, 
well mixed. 

Method II: Scald corn meal with the hot milk; add egg, melted fat, 
and dry ingredients. 

CORN MEAL GRIDDLE CAKES OR WAFFLES, I 

1 cup milk (8 ounces) 2 teaspoons baking powder (^4 oz) 

% cup flour (3 ounces) % teaspoon salt (% ounce) 

% cup corn meal (3% ounces) 1 egg (2 ounces) 

Add beaten egg to milk and add to dry materials, well mixed. 

CORN MEAL GRIDDLE CAKES OR WAFFLES, II 

1 cup sour milk (8 ounces) 1 teaspoon baking powder 

% cup flour (3 ounces) % teaspoon salt (Vs ounce) 

3 /i cup corn meal (3% ounces) 1 egg (2 ounces) 
% teaspoon soda (l/14th ounce) 



Wheat Saving Recipes 55 

INDIAN PUDDING 

% cup corn meal (3% ounces) 3 tablespoons sugar (1% ounces) 

1 quart milk (32 ounces) or 

iy 2 teaspoon salt (% ounce) y z cup molasses (4% ounces) 

Heat the milk. Sift in the corn meal as in making mush. Add 
salt and sugar. Turn into buttered baking dish, put dish in pan of 
water, and bake very slowly 254 to 3 hours. Serve with hard sauce, 
cream, or crushed fruit. 

OATMEAL MUFFINS, I. 

1/2 cup milk (4 ounces) iy 2 cups flour (6 ounces) 

1 cup cooked oatmeal or rolled oats 2 tablespoons sugar ( 1 ounce) 

1 egg (2 ounces) % teaspoon salt (% ounce) 

2 tablespoons fat (1 ounce) 4 teaspoons baking powder (% oz.) 

Cook oatmeal, using one part oatmeal to two parts water. A larger 
proportion of water makes too soft a mush and gummy muffins. Mix 
milk, oatmeal, egg, and melted fat. Add dry ingredients after sifting 
them together. Bake 25 to 30 minutes. This makes 10 to 12 muffins. 

OATMEAIi MUFFINS, II. 

1% cups milk (12 ounces) 1 teaspoon salt (% ounce) 

2 eggs (4 ounces) 2 cups rolled oats (S 1 /^ ounces) 

2 tablespoons fat (1 ounce) 1 cup flour (4 ounces) 

2 tablespoons sugar (1 ounce) 4 teaspoons baking powder (1 oz.) 

Pour milk over oats and let soak one-half hour. Add eggs and 
melted fat. Add to dry ingredients, which have been sifted together. 
Bake 25 to 30 minutes. This makes 10 to 12 muffins. 

USE CORN AND OATS IN BREAD MAKING 

Corn meal yeast bread, satisfactory in texture and mild in flavor, 
can be made using 20 per cent by measure or 25 per cent by weight of 
total cereal as corn meal. The flavor of white corn meal is less distinc- 
tive and the bread made from it differs in color from that of the usual 
wheat loaf less than that made from the yellow meal. These breads 
may be made by combining dry corn meal with the flour, but the product 
is less satisfactory than that in which the meal is first cooked as for 
corn meal mush. The manipulation is the same as for wheat bread, 
except that it is a little more difficult to knead into the mush the full 
amount of flour and the dough is somewhat softer and stickier. Baking 
should occur in a slower oven, and should continue over a longer period 
at least an hour. 

Oatmeal yeast bread is coarser than wheat bread, and is not unlike 
graham bread in appearance. It has a sweet, nutty flavor, much liked by 
persons who care for whole wheat or dark breads. Some care is necessary 
in combining the rolled oats with the mixture. The most satisfactory 
method has been found to be that of pouring the hot liquid over the 
rolled oats, allowing the mixture to cool rather slowly (about half an 
hour). Longer soaking of the oats produces a somewhat moister bread. 
The manipulation is the same as for wheat bread. The dough is a bit 
softer. Baking requires about 45 minutes. 



56 Our Country's Call to Service 

Proportions and Directions 

All proportions are for one loaf. The amount of yeast provides for 
a very short process 3% to 4 hours. One-half the yeast suggested will 
make bread in 5 hours. 

One cake of dry yeast used as a starter should produce yeast for six 
loaves. In all cases the amount of liquid should be equal to that added 
with the compressed yeast in the recipe given. 

CORN MEAL YEAST BREAD (1 LOAF) 

1^4 cups milk and water or water y 3 cup corn meal (3 l / 3 ounces) 

(10 ounces) . 2^ cups flour (9^ ounces) 

2 tablespoons sugar (1 ounce) % cake compressed yeast (% ounce) 

1 tablespoon fat (% ounce) ^4 cup warm water (2 ounces) 

2 teaspoons salt (% ounce) 

Add sugar, fat, and salt to liquid, and bring to boiling point. Add 
corn meal slowly, stirring constantly until all is added. Remove from 
fire, cool mixture, and add compressed yeast softened in *4 cup warm 
water. Add 2*/j cups flour and knead. Let rise until about double its 
bulk, knead again, and put in the pan. When light, bake in a moderate 
oven for at least an hour. 

In mixing the dough the flour and corn meal are to be used as sep- 
arate ingredients, because the corn meal must be scalded or a grainy 
bread results. When the corn meal mixture is removed from the stove, 
the housewife will doubt her ability to add the amount of flour called 
for. The flour will work in, as required, but a stiffer, stickier dough 
than that to which she is accustomed will result. 

OATMEAL YEAST BREAD (1 LOAF) 

1 cup milk and water, or water 1 cup rolled oats (2% ounces) 

(8 ounces) 2% cups wheat flour (10 ounces) 

1 teaspoon salt (% ounce) % cake compressed yeast (% ounce) 

1 tablespoon fat (% ounce) % cup warm water (2 ounces) 

2 tablespoons sugar (1 ounce) 

Scald liquid and pour it over the rolled oats, sugar, salt, and fat. 
Let stand until lukewarm (about half an hour). Add yeast softened in 
warm water. Add flour and knead. Let rise until double its bulk. 
Knead again and place in pan. When light, bake in a moderate oven 
from 45 to 60 minutes. 

BARLEY, RYE, RICE, OR POTATO FLOUR YEAST BREADS 

Barley yeast bread. Bread may be made using wheat flour and 
barley flour in mixtures containing from 33^ to 50 per cent barley flour. 
The bread containing one-third barley flour is light, palatable, anfl of 
especially pleasant flavor. A larger percentage produces a heavier, 
darker bread of pronounced barley flavor. The manipulation for this 
bread is the same as for wheat bread. The conditions and time for 
baking are also the same. The loaf is smaller. 



Wheat Saving Recipes 57 

BAELEY YEAST BEEAD 

1 cup milk and water, or water 1 teaspoon salt (^ ounce) 

(8 ounces) \y 6 cups barley flour (4 ounces) 

1 tablespoon sugar (% ounce) Zy 3 cups wheat flour (9^ ounces) 

1 tablespoon fat (% ounce) % cake compressed yeast (% ounce) 

Soften the yeast in part of the liquid. Combine ingredients. Mix 

/ into a dough. Knead and let rise to double original bulk. Knead again. 

Put in the pan, and when again double in bulk bake about 45 minutes. 

Rye yeast bread. Commercial rye breads are made of a mixture of 
wheat and rye flours, known in the trade as 50-50. Eye flour has much 
less expansion than wheat flour; hence the loaves are smaller. The 
manipulation is the same throughout as for wheat bread. 

Proportions and directions: 

EYE YEAST BEEAD 

1 cup milk and water, or water 2^ cups rye flour (7 ounces) 

(8 ounces) 2*4 cups wheat flour (9 ounces) ' 

1 tablespoon fat (% ounce) % cake compressed yeast (*4 ounce) 

2 tablespoons sugar (1 ounce) 2 tablespoons water ( 1 ounce) 
1 teaspoon salt (^4 ounce) 

Combine ingredients. Mix into dough and knead. Let rise until 
double original bulk. Knead again. When again double bulk, bake 
about 45 minutes. 

BICE 

Cooked rice combined with wheat flour makes delicious muffins and 
yeast bread. There are many ways of cooking the rice. The basic 
principles may be stated as follows: First, cook the rice so as to con- 
serve all mineral matter and other soluble products. 

Method: After the rice is thoroughly washed it should be put in a 
thick iron kettle or stoneware baking dish, and cold water added so that 
the water stands three-quarters of an inch to an inch clear above the rice. 
A heavy or weighted cover should be used to seal the dish. Cook slowly 
over direct heat or in the oven until all the water has been absorbed and 
the grains are soft and steam escapes from the vessel. This is the 
Japanese method. The second method, more frequently used in the 
United States, is to use a very large amount of boiling water to a small 
amount of rice, the rice being added slowly enough not to stop the 
boiling. The water is boiled briskly 20 minutes, or until the kernels are 
tender. Then it is drained in a colander or strainer, set on the back of 
the stove or put in a slightly warm oven or in a pan over hot water, to 
dry off a bit. There results a fluffy mass of large, plump grains, each 
perfectly distinct in itself, instead of the gummy mush so often served 
as boiled rice. 

The rice yeast bread is very white in color, is moister than wheat 
bread, and keeps moist longer. It is handled in much the same manner 
as wheat bread. The first dough, however, is much stiffer, and after once 
rising the light dough is so soft that it cannot be kneaded with the 
hands. It should be well stirred with a strong spoon and placed in the 
pans, looking much like a stiff drop batter. After baking, the upper 
crust is less smooth than that of our familiar wheat flour loaf. 



58 Our Country's Call to Service 

RICE YEAST BREAD 

(These amounts make two large or three small loaves of bread.) 

% cup milk and water or water 7 cups boiled rice 

(4 ounces) 8 cups flour (32 ounces) 

4 tablespoons sugar ( 2 ounces) % cake compressed yeast (^ oz.) 

4 tablespoons fat (2 ounces) % cup warm water (2 ounces) 
teaspoons salt (% ounce) 



Scald liquid if milk is used. Pour over fat, sugar, and salt. Cool 
and add yeast, moistened in % cup warm water. Add rice and flour and 
knead. After second rising bake 45 minutes. 

POTATO YEAST BREAD 

Boiled potatoes mashed and combined with wheat flour may be used 
in making a bread of good flavor and texture. The potato bread is 
slightly darker in color than patent flour bread and is also somewhat 
more moist. It is relished by persons who do not care for any but 
so-called " white-bread. ' ' Two manipulations are satisfactory. Either 
all the flour may be added in the first mixture, making a dough which is 
very stiff and difficult to knead or a part of the flour may be reserved 
and added with the second kneading. In either case the dough is soft 
at the second handling, but after baking it produces a satisfactory loaf. 

(The following amounts make three loaves of bread.) 

% cup milk and water or water 4 cups boiled potatoes 

(4 ounces) 8 cups flour (32 ounces) 

4 tablespoons sugar ( 2 ounces) % cake compressed yeast (% 02.) 

4 tablespoons fat (2 ounces) % cup warm water (2 ounces) 
iy 2 teaspoons salt (% ounce) 

CONSERVATION PIE CRUSTS 

Corn Meal Crust 

Grease a pie plate well. Cover with raw corn meal, giving the plate 
a rotating motion so that an even layer of the meal will stick to the 
plate about -& of an inch in thickness. Fill the plate with pumpkin 
pie mixture. Bake in a hot oven. 

Oatmeal Crust 

2 cups finely ground oatmeal 
1 cup boiling water 
1 teaspoon fat 

Scald the oatmeal with the water. Add fat and mix thoroughly. 
Roll very thin and line small pie or tart tins with the mixture. Bake 
in a hot oven. Fill with apricot marmalade or other thick mixture.

C MEAT SAVING RECIPES 

MAKE A LITTLE MEAT GO A LONG WAY USE SAVORY 

STEWS AND MEAT PIES 

Do you know how good they are? They may be so varied that you 
can have a different one every day in the week, and all of them delicious. 
It needs only a small piece of meat to give flavor to a hearty dish. 

Don't think you must eat a lot of meat to be strong. Meat is good 
to help build up the body, but so are many other foods. 

In these dishes part of your building material comes from the more 
expensive meat and part from the cheaper peas, beans, hominy, and 
barley. The little meat with the vegetables and cereals will give your 
body what it needs. 

HOW TO COOK THE STEWS 

All kinds of stews are cooked in just about the same way. Here 
are directions which will serve for making almost any kind. 

Cut the meat in small pieces and brown with the onion in the fat 
cut from the meat. Add the salt and pepper, seasoning vegetables 
(onion, celery tops, etc.), 2 quarts of water, and the rice, or other cereal, 
if it is to be used. Cook for an hour, then add the vegetables except 
potatoes. Cook the stew for half an hour, add the potatoes cut in quar- 
ters, cook for another half an hour, and serve. 

The tireless cooker may well be used, the meat and the vegetables 
being put in at the same time. 

Left-overs or canned vegetables need only to be heated through. 
Add them 15 minutes before serving. 

Dried peas or beans should be soaked over night and cooked for three 
hours before adding to the stew; or, better, cook them over night in a 
fireless cooker. 

SAVORY STEWS 

Try them. They can be a whole meal and a nutritious one. These 
recipes serve five people. 

Here is an English stew that is especially good: 

HOT POT OF MUTTON AND BARLEY 

1 pound mutton 4 potatoes 

% cup pearled barley 3 onions 

1 tablespoon salt Celery tops or other seasoning herbs. 

Cut the mutton in small pieces, and brown with the onion in fat cut 
from meat. This will help make the meat tender and improves the flavor 
Pour this into a covered saucepan. Add 2 quarts water and the barley. 
Simmer for 1% hours. Then add the potatoes cut in quarters, season- 
ing herbs, and seasoning, and cook one-half hour longer. 



60 Our Country's Call to Service 

BEEF STEW 

1 pound beef % peck peas or 1 can 

4 potatoes cut in quarters ^4 cup carrots cut up small 

1 teaspoon salt 

Cut the meat in small pieces and brown in the fat from the meat. 
Simmer in 2 quarts of water for one hour. Add the peas and carrots 
and cook for one-half hour, then add the potatoes. If canned peas are 
used, add them 10 minutes before serving. Serve when potatoes are 
done. 



MEAT PIES 

Another good way to use a little meat. Have you ever used rice, 
corn meal mush, or hominy for a crust? This is less work than a pastry 
crust and saves wheat. 

4 cups cooked corn meal, rice, or % teaspoon pepper 

hominy j tablespoon fat 

1 onion 1 pound raw meat or left over meat 

2 cups tomato cut up small 

% teaspoon salt 

Melt the fat, add the sliced onion, and if raw meat is used, add it 
and stir until the red color disappears. Add the tomato and seasoning. 
If cooked meat is used, add it with the tomato and seasoning, after the 
onion is browned, and heat through. Grease a baking dish, put in a 
layer of the cereal, add the meat and gravy, and cover with the cereal 
dotted with fat. Bake for half an hour. 



DIFFERENT STEWS 

Here is the way you can change the stews to make them different 
and to suit the season: 



1. The meat. This may be any kind and more or less than a pound 
may be used. Use the cheap cuts, the flank, rump, neck, or brisket. 
The long, slow cooking makes them tender. Game and poultry are good. 

2. Potatoes and barley may be used or barley alone, or rice, hominy, 
or macaroni. 

3. Vegetables. Carrots, turnips, onions, peas, beans, cabbage, 
tomatoes are good, canned or fresh. Use one or more of these, as you 
wish. 

4. Parsley, celery tops, onion tops, seasoning herbs, or chopped 
sweet peppers add to the flavor. 

5. Many left-overs may be used not only meat and vegetables, but 
rice or hominy.

red color disappears. Add the tomato, pepper, and salt. Grease a bak- 
ing-dish, put in a layer of corn meal mush, add the seasoned meat, and 
cover with mush. Bake 30 minutes. 



RABBIT IN CASSEROLE 

1 rabbit 2 cups meat stock or thickened gravy 

% cup drippings or other fat 1 tablespoon lemon juice 

1 cup hot water Bit of bay leaf 

Dress the rabbit and separate into pieces at the joints. Season with 
paprika and salt. Cook in the fat until a golden brown. Transfer the 
meat to a casserole with one cup of hot water and cover. Bake in a 
moderate oven about one-half hour, then add the stock or gravy, lemon 
juice, and bay leaf. Continue cooking in the oven about three hours.

POTTED HOMINY AND BEEF 

Hominy is excellent to use as part of a one-dish dinner, if you have a 
fire in your stove so that you can cook it for a long time, or use a fire- 
less cooker. Heat 1% quarts of water to boiling; add 1 teaspoon of salt 
and 2 cups of hominy which has been soaked over night. Cook in a double 
boiler for four hours or in the fireless cooker over night. This makes 
5 cups. This recipe may be increased and enough cooked in different 
ways for several meals. Hominy is excellent combined with dried, 
canned, or fresh fish, or meat and vegetable left-overs may be used. 
Here is one combination. 

5 cups cooked hominy % pound chipped or ground beef 

4 potatoes 2 cups milk 

2 cups carrots 2 tablespoons fat

F FOOD FOR THE CHILDREN 

Give the children their chance. They ought to have it and you 
want to give it to them. They must have the right food. 

Think how fast the child grows. The new muscles and bones and all 
the other parts of the body are made from the food which the child eats. 

Give him clean, wholesome, simply cooked food plenty of milk, 
cereals, vegetables, fruit, and egg or some meat occasionally. 

Wrong food too little, too much, or wrong kinds hurts the child's 
chance of being the strong, healthy boy or girl you want. 

Eight food may mean: 

Strong Bodies Good Brains 

Eosy Cheeks Bright Eyes 

Help your child to grow big and strong. 

Here's Good Food for the Youngsters 

Milk and plenty of it, makes them grow a quart each day if you can. 
Put it on their cereal and in their cups. Make it into soups, puddings, or 
custards. Try the recipes on page 71 and watch them smile. 

Whole milk is best, of course, but skim milk is good if there is 
a little butter in their meals. Cottage cheese is good, too. 

No coffee or tea not even a taste. Leave them for the grownups. 
Milk, cocoa, not too strong, and fruit juices are the drinks for children, 
and plenty of water always. 

Fruit they enjoy, and they need it, too baked apples, apple sauce, 
thoroughly ripe bananas, prunes, oranges, etc. Give them vegetables 
fresh or canned. Plenty of fruits and vegetables tend to prevent consti- 
pation. Use proper food and do not depend upon laxatives. 

Other foods children need: (1) Whole wheat bread, not too fresh, 
corn bread, well-cooked oatmeal, corn meal, rice; they help make strong 
boys and girls. (2) Some fats, butter or margarine or meat fats on their 
bread or in gravies. (3) An egg, perhaps, particularly if they don't get 
their full quart of milk; or they can have a little meat or fish, but they 
do not need much of this kind of food. 

Sweets are good for them the right ones at the right time. Dates, 
raisins, stewed fruits, simple puddings, sugar cookies, are better than 
candy. Give them at meal times. 

Between meals let them have bread and butter, a cracker, or fruit. 
These won't spoil the appetite, and candy will.

THE VOLUNTEER WAR GARDEN ARMY 

(A Summons to Young America, by President Wilson) 

Every boy and girl who really sees what the home 
garden may mean will, I am sure, enter into the purpose 
with high spirit because I am sure they would all like to 
feel that they are in fact fighting in France by joining 
the home garden army. 

They know that America has undertaken to send 
meat and flour and wheat and other foods for the sup- 
port of the soldiers who are doing the fighting, for the 
men and women who are making the munitions, and for 
the boys and girls of western Europe, and that we must 
also feed ourselves while carrying on this war. 

The movement to establish gardens, therefore, and to 
have the children work in them is just as real and pa- 
triotic an effort as the building of ships or the firing of 
cannon. I hope that this spring every school will have 
a regiment in the volunteer war garden army. 



The Home Garden 75 

WHY YOU SHOULD RAISE A HOME GARDEN 

There are at least five reasons why every American boy or 
girl who can, should raise a home garden: 

(1) As the preceding lessons in this book have shown you, 
the food supply for us and our Allies is insufficient. 
Your back yard can help make it sufficient. Don't let 
your yard be a slacker. 

(2) Our railroads are greatly overcrowded carrying war 
supplies. Every pound of food that is brought to you 
from some other part of the country takes space in a 
freight car that might be used for munitions of war. 
It doesn't take any freight cars to carry vegetables from 
your backyard garden to your kitchen. Help lighten 
the load that our railroads must carry. 

(3) The vegetables you grow yourself will reach your table 
fresher and with finer flavor than any you can buy. 
If you have never eaten home-grown vegetables, raise 
a backyard garden and give yourself and your family 
a treat. 

(4) It costs money to buy vegetables ; why not save it ? A 
garden 25x40 feet if carefully tended will produce most 
of the vegetables needed for a family of four or five 
people for several months. Such a garden will save

GENEEAL SUGGESTIONS 

When you have decided that you will have a home garden 
there are several problems that you will need to consider care- 
fully if your efforts are to succeed. 

Location and Size of Plot 

A well drained, light, fertile soil, slightly sloping to the 
south or west is to be preferred for a garden. However, if you 
cannot get just what you want, make the best choice of what 
is offered you. 

If you live on a farm, your home garden should be located 
as near the house as possible on land offering the best kind of 
soil and drainage conditions. A field 20 to 30 rods from the 
house is generally best for all purposes. Such a garden gives 
plenty of room and permits long rows with space enough be- 
tween them so that farm tools and teams may be used. 

If you live in a town or city, your home garden must often 
be located in the back yard or on a vacant lot. In many cases 
the owner of the lot is glad to have it used without charge, 
because gardening keeps down weeds and changes an unsightly 
lot into an attractive spot in the community. Avoid much 
shade and hard, infertile soil. Do not choose a spot where 
the garden will be tramped upon or where the drainage is bad. 
But if poor ground is the only thing you can get, it may be 
made productive by the addition of good fertilizing material, 
by thorough preparation of the soil where you plant the seeds 
and by frequent hoeing after the plants appear. 

The size of the plot is a matter of great importance. If you 
have never had experience in gardening, do not make the 
mistake of laying out too large a plot. A garden 25x40 feet if 
carefully tended will produce sufficient vegetables for a small 
family, and will not require a discouraging amount of work. 

Fertilizing the Soil 

If the soil is not rich, fertilize with well rotted barn-yard 
manure or other needed fertilizing material, working it in well. 
"While it is best to apply this in the fall, it may be applied in 
the spring. Avoid strawy material or any but well rotted 
manure. Remove brickbats, ashes, or anything else which will 
not make a fine, mellow, fertile bed for the seeds. In some 
city or town home gardens it may be necessary to spread sev- 
eral inches of good, rich black dirt on the plot. 



General Suggestions 77 

Preparing the Seed Bed 

The preparation of the seed bed (the soil into which the 
seeds are to be placed) is very important. Vegetables must 
have a loose, fertile soil, well pulverized, deep enough so that 
their roots may go down easily for plant food so that they may 
develop rapidly every day during the growing season. A 
poorly prepared seed bed can never be made right after the 
seeds are planted. Poorly prepared seed beds grow stunted, 
tough, ill-flavored vegetables. 

If your garden is to be plowed, first remove all trash, then 
distribute the fertilizing material evenly. Make sure that the 
ground is well plowed and harrowed when dry enough so that 
it will not become lumpy and hard later. 

If your garden is not one that is to be plowed, spading, if 
thoroughly done, will prepare the soil satisfactorily. Spade 
deeply enough to make a fine, mellow seed bed. 

But the soil for the garden can hardly ever be made fine 
enough by spading alone. In most cases the soil for the seed 
bed should be smoothed and pulverized more by the use of the 
hand rake. The surface of the soil should be pulverized to a 
depth of several inches. It should be uniform and free from 
lumps. All stones and trash should be removed. The smaller 
the seed the finer the seed bed must be, although all of our 
vegetable seed require a well prepared seed bed and a surface 
which is smooth and fine. 

Do not raise the seed bed above the common level unless 
your garden is in a very wet place which needs drainage. The 
raised seed bed allows the soil to dry out, which is generally 
just what we do not want, especially during the hot months 
when vegetables grow rapidly and need plenty of moisture. 

The Best Vegetables to Grow 

As soon as the size of the garden has been determined, make 
a list of the vegetables you want to plant. Select only a few 
of the most important vegetables and do not try to grow too 
many varieties. A large number of varieties are rarely ever 
profitable and they are hard to grow. Do not select uncom- 
mon varieties. Select the varieties which grow and soil 
and which may be canned for winter use. 



78 Our Country's Call to Service 

As a rule, only five or six of the most important vegetables 
should be grown. Several early crops should be grown. The 
following vegetables are suggested for early planting before 
the time arrives to plant tomatoes : onion sets, radishes, lettuce 
beets, early bush peas, and early bush beans. 

The onion sets, lettuce, peas, and radishes can be planted 
just as early as the ground can be plowed and properly pre- 
pared. 

The beets should be planted about a week later than the 
radishes, while the bush beans must not be planted until all 
danger of frost is past. The beans are tender plants and will 
freeze easily while the onions, radishes, peas, lettuce, and beets 
are. hearty plants and can stand a little frost. 

The tomatoes must not be planted until later in the season. 
They are tender plants and do not like cold. 

Don't waste space and energy by growing crops that take 
large areas. All of the space in a small garden is too valuable 
to plant any of it to potatoes and vine crops. If you have 
time to plant and care for such space-consuming crops, try to 
get the use of a vacant lot on which to grow them. 

Make a Plan of Your Garden 

Measure your lot and then plan your garden on paper. In 
making the plan first take care of the winter vegetables; the 
summer vegetables will take care of themselves. Plan to make 
every foot of the garden produce the maximum by growing 
vegetables that ripen quickly between the rows of crops that 
are slower in growth and in the rows to be devoted to late- 
planted vegetables. 

Study the garden plan on page 79 and follow it as a model. 
Locate the permanent crops first and then work in the tem- 
porary ones. The permanent crops to grow for the winter sup- 
ply are beets, late cabbage, carrots, onions, parsnips, rutabagas, 
turnips, tomatoes, and possibly celery, beans and salsify. 

Plant Good Seed 

One of the essentials of a good garden is good seed. It 
does not pay to plant inferior seeds. Buy only from a reliable 
dealer or secure seed grown in the neighborhood by some re- 
liable person, even though you may have to pay a little more 
for it. When you have grown a good variety, save your own 
seed for the next year.

buy plants. 

Most vegetables should be planted as early in April as the 
conditions of soil and weather will permit. This will vary with 
different vegetables according to whether they are hardy or 
tender. 

Plan to make several plantings of peas, radishes, lettuce, 
sweet-corn, and other vegetables desired for continuous fresh 
successive crops. These plantings may be made every few 
weeks. Some of the early plantings will be harvested soon 
enough to give room for planting later vegetables, thus allow- 
ing, two, three, or more crops on the same ground during the 
season. 

Beans, melons, cucumbers, squashes, eggplants, peppers, 
corn, and tomatoes are tender and generally should not be 
planted out of doors before May 1-15 or even later. One can 
secure early cabbage, tomatoes, and cauliflower by planting the 
seed in a box indoors, or in a hot-bed, and transplanting to the 
garden when the ground becomes warm. Melon seeds can be 
planted in the house in pasteboard boxes, or strawberry boxes, 
during March. The boxes can be torn away and the little 
vines may be planted in the open very successfully. Thus early 
melons can be secured. 

Be careful not to cover seeds too deep. Plant most garden 
seeds within one-half inch of the surface. Corn, beans, peas, 
and melons may be covered two inches. Potatoes generally do 
best when planted three or four inches deep. 

Before planting mark off the rows straight and even. For 
a small garden, use a piece of twine and small stakes. 

Cover the seeds with only fine, mellow, moist earth. Keep 
dry clods and trashy material away from them. 



The Home Garden 81 

Whether the planting be done in a large garden with a 
garden drill, or in a small garden by hand, be sure to press 
the moist, loose soil firmly about the seed. You can do this 
easily by pressing gently on the seeds after they are covered. 

Unless you know how the little seedling plants look when 
they first appear, you may destroy some of them when you 
hoe, or pull them out when first weeding the garden by hand. 
Observe plants, find pictures and descriptions and ask other 
people until you learn just how each little plant looks. Great 
care must be exercised the first time you hoe or weed your 
garden to prevent covering the plants, pulling them up or cut- 
ting them off with the hoe. Avoid crippling any of them. 
Give every plant a fair chance to grow. If the plants are too 
thick in some places pull out or cut off the weakest looking of 
them without disturbing the others more than necessary. 

Cultivating or Hoeing 

Keep the garden free from weeds at all times. It pays. 
Keep the top soil mellow, so as to prevent crusting. It is best 
to cultivate about every week during the growing season. Con- 
tinue cultivating through June and July or as late as plants 
continue growing. Moisture will be kept in the ground for the 
use of the plants and plants will grow rapidly all the time, the 
yield will be large, and everything will be crisp and tender. 

It is best not to cultivate when the ground is wet. "When 
there are no weeds or when the weeds are small, a garden 
rake is an excellent tool with which to cultivate. But if the 
ground gets hard on top, or weedy, it may be necessary to use 
a hoe. 

Stick to the Task. 

Make the best use of everything connected with your work 
and no matter how many failures and discouragements come, 
show the true American spirit by sticking to it until you ac- 
complish something definite. Keep cheerful, work patiently 
and carefully, profit by your mistakes and misfortunes, and 
keep at it until you succeed. This is the spirit that will help 
American boys and girls to take an active part in the great 
army of Service. 



82 Our Country's Call to Service 

SOME GARDEN DON'TS 

Don't sprinkle your garden. Water it once a week if neces- 
sary. 

Don 't let the weeds get a start. 

Don't permit the surface soil to become compact or lumpy. 

Don 't hoe the soil when it is too moist. 

Don't let the "bugs" get your plants. This means you must 
watch plants closely. 

Don't waste your time planting lettuce, peas, turnips, spin- 
ach, and other ' ' cool ' ' crops during hot weather. 

Don't try to cultivate too much land, especially if it is sod. 
Intensive work on a small area usually gives better returns 
than the same amount put on a large area. 

Don't procrastinate. "A stitch in time saves nine" in gar- 
dening. 

Don't slight the hoeing. Hoeing is one of the chief elements 
of success in garden. 

Don't experiment. Use only standard vegetables, proved 
varieties and established methods. This is no time for experi- 
ments. 

Don't quit. You, your family, and your country will be the 
losers if you do. 



Questions and Suggestions 

1. Mention some reasons why you should obey the summons of Presi- 
dent Wilson given on page 74. 

2. If most of the 22,000,000 American school children should raise home 
gardens, how many dollars' worth of food might be raised? 

3. What are some of the things you would need to consider carefully 
before you plant your garden? 

4. Look over the list of Garden Bulletins on page 125 and send for the 

ones you think will help you most.

A WARNING FROM THE FUEI> ADMINISTRATOR 
Dr. Gar field wanns us: 

"It is the duty of every American to save coal this winter. 
If every family will save a ton of coal; if every industrial 
plant will save 10% of the coal it now wastes, the coal prob- 
lem will be largely solved. If every family will reduce the 
temperature of its house at least five degrees it will mean that 
millions of tons of coal will be saved and the health of the 
Nation greatly improved.' 

We use almost 100 million tons of coal each year for heating 
our houses. It is estimated that 10 per cent of this coal could 
be saved by proper care of furnaces and by economy in the 
use of gas and electricity. Such a saving would mean: 

1. Warmer homes for your neighbor who now 
cannot get enough coal; 

2. Less burden on the railroads that carry coal, 
thus setting free cars to transport soldiers and muni- 
tions ; 

3. One hundred millions of dollars saved for help- 
ing win the war; 

4. Thousands of miners could be spared to work 
in war employment. 

Will you help save a ton of coal a year in your house? 
These pages tell how to get the greatest amount of heat from 
the smallest amount of coal. By following these rules you can 
prove your loyalty.

HOW TO SAVE COAL IN YOUR FURNACE 

The following rules will help save coal for your country 
and dollars for you. 

RULES FOR USING SOFT COAL 

1. Thoroughly clean flues and passages of boiler or fur- 
nace at least once a day. The heat from the coal fire should 
come directly to the sides of the heater and pipes. If they 
are allowed to become covered with a layer of soot, the heat 
will not reach the metal, but will go up the chimney and be 
lost. Soot is an almost perfect heat "insulator," that is, it does 
not allow heat to pass through it. To remove soot, brush out 
the inside surface of boiler thoroughly, wherever a collection 
has begun to form. One-eighth inch of soot on boiler surfaces 
reduces transfer of heat 25 per cent. 

2. Hot water plants should have water renewed in fall 
before starting heating season. 

3. Clean soot from base of chimney and smokepipe once 
a year. If they are clogged with soot, much heat is wasted. 

Method of Firing 

1. Fire (put on coal) often and lightly, keeping grates 
fully covered. 

2. Do not spoil the fire by stirring it around or mixing 
it up. 

3. Use poker under fire bed on top of grates, lifting only 
enough to break or crack open the mass. Keep fire free from 
clinkers. 

4. Don't smother the fire by packing a thick coat of fresh 
coal over all the burning service. A fire needs fresh air as 
much as you do. 

5. Use the smaller prepared sizes of coal if possible. If 
you cannot get the small coal, break the large coal into small 
lumps. Wet all soft coal thoroughly before firing. This makes 
a hotter fire and keeps it from burning out too quickly. 

6. The best way to fire round boilers or furnaces is to get 
the house warm by firing lightly and often. When the house 
is comfortably warm (not above 68) fill the fire pot full cf 
wet coal. Next take a piece of pipe or broomstick and poke a 
hole down through the fuel bed to the grate. Carefully with- 
draw and leave hole in fuel bed. Check off the draft so that 
it will not burn too rapidly. This hole soon will carry a large

blue flame, which is gas driven off from the fresh coal. If 
this method is followed, the gas will not be lost up the chimney. 

Ashes 

1. Don't shake grate violently. It wastes coal. 

Never allow ashes to collect below the grate. Ashes 
reflect the heat, burning and warping the grate. Moreover, 
' ashes are banked up under the grate they prevent circula- 
tion of the air necessary for a good fire. 

Keep ash pit clean. ."Remove ashes from last shaking 
before shaking again. 

Draft 

1. Be sure your chimney is large enough, high enough, and 
absolutely tight. If in doubt, consult an expert. This may 
cost a few dollars, but it may save a ton of coal or more each 
year. The saving of money will benefit you ; the saving of coal 
will benefit our country. 

2. Do not allow any other pipes to be connected to the 
heating chimney except those of the heating boiler or furnace. 
The draft may be spoiled by such connections. 

3. Regulation of draft is very important in saving coal 
and should be attended to at once by an experienced man. If 
you cannot regulate your draft, be sure to call for assistance. 

4. The draft to ash pit should not be open any more than 
necessary to keep the desired temperature. 

5. Do not open ash pit door to increase draft. Use the 
draft damper under grate provided for this purpose. 

6. Check draft must not be open unless draft damper 
under grate is closed. 

RULES FOR USING HARD COAL 

1. Thoroughly clean flues and passages of boiler or fur- 
nace at least once every week. 

2. Clean base of chimney in same manner as explained for 
soft coal. 

Method of Firing 

1. In using anthracite coal a bright fire should always be 
kept if you wish heat. In building up a fire put on a small 
quantity often, keeping a good draft until the fire pot is full 
to the center of the fire door. Draft then can be checked to 
hold the heat desired. 



88 Our Country's Call to Service 

* 

2. A hard coal fire should never be disturbed by stirring 
or breaking up with a poker. 

3. Remove clinkers, if any, through grate or clinker door. 

4. Use size of coal recommended by maker of boiler or fur- 
nace. Don't wet hard coal. 

Ashes 
Rules same as for soft coal.

Rules same as for soft coal. 

GENERAL SUGGESTIONS 

1. Cover boiler and pipes with asbestos or other insula- 
tion so that the heat will reach your rooms instead of being 
wasted in your cellar. Also weather strip your windows and 
doors, or stuff cracks with cotton. Allowing warm air to escape 
through these cracks is like throwing coal out of the window. 

2. Keep your room at 68 degrees (best heat for health). 
If you are moving about in the room, even a lower temperature 
will be sufficient. 

3. Heat only the rooms you use all the time. It isn't neces- 
sary to have every room in the house heated. Most people 
would be healthier if they slept in cold bedrooms. Close off all 
spare rooms. 

4. Close bedroom doors when windows are open and shut 
off radiator or shut register. 

5. When any room is kept at a lower temperature than 
other rooms keep door closed. 

6. In very cold weather, if windows are open, protect hot 
water radiator by throwing a blanket or rug over it. Radiator 
may then be shut off without fear of freezing. 

7. Use hot water sparingly, as every gallon of hot water 
wasted means loss of coal. 

8. To supplement your furnace in severe weather, or to 
take the place of the furnace in milder weather, burn wood in 
an open grate if your house contains one. The wood may not 
be cheaper, but it does not usually need to be transported from 
great distances. Remember, that every freight car that is 
hauling things for your use would be doing a better war service 
if it were hauling things for our soldiers' use. 

9. During spring and summer months lay in your supply of 
coal for the winter. 



Saving Fuel 89 

SOME DON'T 8 

Don't waste gas or electricity. It takes coal to make them. 
Don't forget that a fireless cooker saves fuel. 

Don't take unnecessary train rides. Fewer passengers 
mean fewer cars. Fewer cars mean less coal. 

Don't grumble if your house is a few degrees cooler than 
you would like it to be. Put on a sweater, and remember that 
the boys in khaki can't keep the trenches at a temperature 
of 70 degrees. 

Questions and Exercises 

1. Mention some ways in which the furnace must be cared for to do 
its work properly. 

2. Why must America conserve on her coal supply? Suggest some 
ways a family may save at least a ton a year. 

3. What is the best temperature for health? The customary tem- 
perature? 

4. When should the winter's supply of coal be bought? Why? 

5. Why must we be careful to waste no gas or electricity?

A MESSAGE FROM MR. McADOO 

(Secretary of the Treasury) 




Nations have their childhood and their days 
of hard lessons just as children do. One hun- 
dred and forty years ago when the first Amer- 
ican Army marched to battle, our Nation was 
younger among Nations than you are among 
your fathers, your mothers, and their friends. 
Our Army had drummer boys in those days, 
real boys of 10 and 12, who marched as bravely 
and as proudly into cannon fire as their great 
chief, General Washington, himself. Our Na- 
tion had little girls, who laughed and cheered 
and loaded muskets for their fathers, who fired 
through loop holes in their cabin homes, when 
the painted Indians charged to the very doors. 
Where many school houses stand today Amer- 
ican boys and girls may have helped to fight 
and to defeat the enemy, when our Nation, too, 
was young. 

We are in the greatest war of the world's w. G. MCADOO 

history and we must win this war. We can 

and we shall win, if the boys and girls of America say so, and mean it. 
and feel it, and live it, as the boys and girls of '76 lived and felt and 
helped. 

The Nation needs that sort of boys and girls today. Not to beat our 
drums, nor to load our muskets, but to start a great work which must be 
done. It is the part of boys and girls today to give an example of self- 
denial and sacrifice, to teach fathers and mothers, to teach the grown peo- 
ple of the Nation, that we still have in every young heart the spirit of '76, 
when boys led our soldiers into battle and girls fought beside their fathers 
at the cabin walls. The lesson is " Thrift" saving to the point of sacri- 
fice, self-denial of everything unnecessary. If every boy and girl says at 
home tonight, "I will fight in this war, ' ' "I will save every penny and 
loan it to my government to help save the lives of the big brothers of 
America," "I will try to teach every American I see to do the same' 
then 20,000,000 homes, the homes of all America, will be filled with the 
spirit of '76, the spirit of the drummer boys, of the brave girls of those 
days. America will win again, as it has always won, through the splendid 
strength, courage, and sacrifice in the hearts of youth, that today will teach 
the Nation the lesson of saving and serving which it must and will learn, 
through the message which its school children will carry home. 

Through saving your pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, and buying thrift 
stamps and then war-savings certificates, you will help your country and 
its gallant armies to win the war.

FRANK VANDERLIP 



A MESSAGE FEOM ME. VANDEELIP 

(National Chairman, War Savings Committee) 



President Wilson has said, "If this country 
can learn something about saving it will be 
worth the cost of the war; I mean the literal 
cost of it in money and resources. " 

The War-Savings Plan of the United States 
Government is the logical outgrowth of the 
President's statement. Under the direction of 
the Secretary of the Treasury, William G. Mc- 
Adoo, this plan, now in operation, offers to 
every individual in the country the opportunity 
to lend a hand in the winning of this war; it 
enables every soul in the Nation to make his 
patriotism count. I do not question for a min- 
ute that there is an enormous and splendidly 
eager army of small savers ready to come for- 
ward and do their part in this great cause. 

Our per capita savings in the United States 
are now estimated at $50. In Denmark and 
Norway the per capita savings are $70, in 
Switzerland $86, in Australia $91, and in New 
Zealand $98. 



It is apparent, therefore, that we in this country have only started to 
save. We are getting the highest wages in the world and have had the 
best opportunity in the world to save, but, unfortunately, we have been 
extravagant and inclined toward improvident living. It is not a difficult 
matter to save if we realize that by saving we are helping those who are 
undergoing indescribable hardship and discomfort and risking their lives 
every day for us and for our country's sake. 

There is in this country only a certain supply of coal, wood, iron, food, 
clothes, etc. Our normal demand consumes nearly all of that supply. 
Now comes the war with a gigantic extra demand. The supply cannot 
meet both our regular demand and the war demand in full. Therefore, one 
must be cut down. The war demand cannot be cut down because we, the 
people, must furnish in lavish abundance those things necessary to winning 
the war. 

The person, therefore, who buys an unnecessary thing, however small 
the cost, and no matter how well able he is to pay for it, is competing with 
the Government for the labor used in producing it and this labor is taken 
away from the great task of producing necessary goods. 

No one should dare to say that he has the right to spend his money as lie 
chooses when the liberties of the world are threatened. No one should dare 
when only the very highest efficiency in money, man-power, and materials 
can in this great emergency make the world safe against Prussian autocracy. 



Waste Not Want Not 95 

THRIFT WHY WE MUST PRACTICE THRIFT 

If you are really a patriotic boy or girl, man or woman; 
if you really want to help win the war, it will not be neces- 
sary to urge you to do your part. You will ask yourself every 
day, "What have I done today to help my country?" "Have 
I done all that it is possible for me to do?" "What should I 
do tomorrow?' You must not merely ask yourself these ques- 
tions; you must be proud of what you have done and what 
you expect to do. 

The Great Cost of the War 

Do you know that Congress has appropriated 19 billion 
dollars since April, 1917, for the purpose of paying the ex- 
penses of this war during the first year ? Do you know what a 
billion dollars is? It is such a large amount that no one can 
imagine how much it is. Possibly you can understand it a little 
better if you know that all of the money spent by our Government 
from its beginning down through all of its wars, through all of 
its days of peace ; all that it has spent for the Panama Canal, 
for the construction of public buildings; every expenditure it 
has made from the first days down to the beginning of this war, 
during nearly 130 years, amounts to a little more than 26 billion 
dollars. Yet we are going to spend 19 billion dollars in one year 
to carry on the war. 

Think for a moment of the many reasons why our Govern- 
ment must have all of these billions of dollars if we are to win 
the war. Our soldiers and sailors need good food and clothing, 
guns and ammunition, boats to carry them and their supplies 
across the ocean, and doctors, nurses, and medicines to bring 
them back to health should they be wounded. To give them 
all these things the United States must have a large amount 
of money, for money is needed to pay the wages of millions of 
people working in America's great factories where the cloth- 
ing, guns, ammunition, and other supplies are made for the 
army, and in our ship yards, where the great battleships, 
cruisers, and destroyers are being built for the Navy. There, 
too, the large ocean-going vessels that are needed to carry our 
troops and their supplies to the fighting line are being con- 
structed.

We now (March, 1918) have about 2,000,000 men under 
arms. The private soldier is paid $30 a month. The officers re- 
ceive more. You will see from this that at $30 a month it is cost- 
ing the Government 60 million dollars a month or 720 million 
dollars a year to pay these men. Of course, when the extra 
amount is added to pay the officers the yearly cost is over a 
billion dollars. Keep in mind that this is for salaries only. 
During the next few months there will be hundreds of thou- 
sands of other men placed under arms and their salaries will 
increase this part of the Government's expenses. In connection 
with salaries you must also remember that the Government is 
employing tens of thousands of people in offices at Washington 
and in towns and cities all over the country. Are there any 
people in your town or city who are employed by the Govern- 
ment to do work made necessary by the war? How many are 
there? How much do you think their services cost the Gov- 
ernment each year? 

Perhaps it will help you to get a clearer idea of the great 
expense of a war if you estimate the answers to the following 
questions. After you have done this, list and estimate other 
war costs. 

1. How many cantonments and training stations have been 
built in the United States since April, 1917? Estimate the 
cost of all of them. 

2. Locate these cantonments and training stations on a 
map and indicate the states from which the men were drawn 
for each. Who pays the railroad fare of a soldier when he is 
asked to report for service? 

3. About how much do you think it would cost the Gov- 
ernment to transport 40,000 soldiers from California to New 
York? 

4. How much does a large battleship cost? A destroyer? 
A merchant vessel ? 

5. What is the cost of a large cannon? A shell for such a 
cannon? A torpedo? An airplane? 

6. It costs about 40 cents a day to feed a soldier or sailor 
while he is in the United States. (It costs much more when he 
is in Europe.) How much does it cost the Government each 
day to feed 2,000,000 men? How much does it cost in a year?

You will no doubt be interested in the following table which 
shows in a more detailed way how the vast sums are being 
spent. It shows the cost of equipping an infantryman for 
service in France. Bear in mind that it is only the cost of one 
complete equipment and does not represent the cost of keeping 
the soldier equipped. Much of his equipment wears out rap- 
idly.

Save Goods and Services 

It must be clear to you by this time that the Government 
needs large sums of money, almost as much as it has spent in 
its entire history. But it must be equally clear that this money 
will be spent for goods and services. The war is taking millions 
of men from occupations on the farms and in the shops here 
at home where they produced goods that furnished many of 
our necessities, comforts, and luxuries, and is sending them to 
the battle fronts where they can not produce goods, but must 
depend on those of us who remain at home to make up 
this great shortage in service. Millions of people are now at 
work, some of our factories are running day and night 



98 Our Country's Call to Service 

producing and manufacturing the food, wool, cotton, linen, 
clothing, leather, chemicals to make explosives, and the steel to 
make the arms and shells. With these millions of men gone, 
with still more millions of people at home changing their occu- 
pations in an effort to supply the new demands, do you think 
we can hope to win the war if we continue to spend our money 
for the same things and as many of them as before the war? 
Do you not see that if we do, we are paying for services ren- 
dered us and not the Government? You surely know that a 
man can't work on a pair of shoes for you and make a pair for 
a soldier at the same time. But if you are careless with your 
shoes, throw them away sooner than is necessary, and buy a 
new pair, you are making some man work for you when he 
might be working for the Government. You are buying that 
man's services. Just to the extent that you do this you are 
competing with your Government. Suppose that 5,000 men 
have been kept busy all of the time in the past manufacturing 
shoes for the people in a certain large section of our country. 
Now suppose that instead of wearing out a pair of shoes every 
six months, each of these persons, by being more careful, 
by having necessary repairs made at the proper time, and by 
being willing to wear his shoes even after they do look a little 
shabby, would wear his shoes two months longer. Do you see 
what would happen? The 5,000 shoe workmen could work 
these two months on shoes for the soldiers and sailors. The 
same thing is true of all kinds of clothing. 

Today, when our boys at the front are fighting and are de- 
pending on us to furnish the services and goods necessary for 
their best protection and equipment ; when the World War is as 
much a test of labor and materials as it is of fighting men, who 
is the loyal American, the person who spends his money buy- 
ing the services necessary to keep himself or herself always 
dressed in the latest style, in band-box appearance, in such a 
way as to meet the approval of the "smart set,' or the one 
who saves services and goods which the Government may use 
by buying fewer dresses and suits, by taking good care of those 
he does buy, by wearing them as long as possible, even if they 
are somewhat out of date and shabby ? In which group do you 
belong? Are you thrifty, or are you extravagant? Are you a 
patriot or a slacker? 

What do you think of the man who refuses to bear arms 
for his country? You call him a slacker because he will not 



Waste Not Want Not 99 

give his services to his country. What do you think of people 
yho are idle much of the time, who loaf, who spend weeks and 
months at places of amusement and summer resorts when it is 
not necessary to their health and efficiency? Oh! To be sure, 
they may say that they can afford it. But that is no reason 
why they should refuse to give their services to their country. 
They are slackers because they are not producing as much as 
they might ; they are not helping to furnish the things needed 
by the boys in the trenches : they are not serving their country. 

There are millions of people on our farms and in our shops 
and factories who can spend much of their .time (services) 
producing and manufacturing goods needed for carrying on 
the war if : 

1. We do not waste anything. 

2. We make clothing and household furnishings last 
longer. 

3. We do not buy the services of others for ourselves before 
these services are absolutely necessary to our health and effi- 
ciency. 

Where the Government Must Get Its Billions 

The Government, like any great business concern, has its 
usual income and expense. As stated above, its expenses dur- 
ing the last 130 years have amounted to 26 billion dollars, but 
it is now forced into a situation where it must spend 19 billions 
in one year. It cannot meet one-tenth of this with its usual 
income and must therefore borrow what it needs. Isn't that 
what any business man does? 

Now, from whom does the Government wish to borrow 
money? From you, your brother, sister, father, mother, and 
friends. It does not ask you to give the money; the Govern- 
ment asks you to lend it. . Perhaps you have a brother, father, 
or some dear one at the front. He may give his life to his 
country. Will you not lend your money f

SEVEN REASONS FOE SAVING 

1. Save for your country's sake, because it is now spend- 
ing millions a day, and must find most of the money out of 
savings. 

2. Save for your own sake, because work and wages are 
plentiful and, while prices are high now, a dollar will buy 
more after the war. 

3. Save because, when you spend, you make other people 
work for you, and the work of everyone is needed now to win 
the war. Therefore, spend wisely. 

4. Save because, by saving, you make things cheaper for 
everyone, especially for those who are poorer than you. 

5. Save because, by -going without, you relieve the strain 
on ships, docks, and railways, and make transport cheaper and 
quicker. 

6. Save because, by saving, you set an example that makes 
it easier for the next man to save. A saving nation is an earn- 
ing nation. 

7. Save because every time you save you help twice, first 
when you don't spend, and again when you lend to the Nation. 

THREE KINDS OF DOLLARS 

A Slacker Dollar. There are three things you can do 
with a dollar. You can hide it, you can spend it, or you can 
invest it. Now a dollar that is hidden away is an idle dollar 
and today, when the Government needs the money, it is a drag 
on the community, just as an idle man is a drag on the com- 
munity. An idle dollar is a slacker. 

A Traitor Dollar. But there is something worse than 
a slacker. A slacker is not doing anything actively to defeat 
the Nation's purposes, but when you spend money for things 
that you do not need, when you employ labor or use up mat 3- 
rial which you could well get along without and that the Gov- 
ernment needs, your dollar is an ally of the enemy. It is a 
traitor dollar. 



Waste NotVtwit- J$ot 101 

1 ) 

A Patriot Dollar. When you knd yqu?,.mar 4 ey to the 
Government, you put it to work to help 'win 'the' war, for that 
dollar will help to buy the clothes, the guns, and the munitions 
that our armies must have. It may be used to buy the motor- 
trucks, engines, and ships that are needed to carry supplies to 
the men, and when we buy things that we can get along with- 
out, then we are postponing the day of victory. 

No More Pleasure as Usual 

"We must all plan to save as much as we can every day and 
every week. You cannot buy a thrift stamp and think that you 
have done your duty. If you have been spending ten cents a 
week for things that you do not need, you should save that 
much every week. If you have spent a dollar a week for 
things that do not help to keep you well and strong, or to in- 
crease your ability to work and study, you should save a 
dollar a week. You are interfering with the Government when 
you go on with pleasure as usual. 

People Who Work for the Government Cannot Work for You 

Suppose you wanted a man to drive you to the railroad sta- 
tion and you saw a man driving an ambulance. Would you stop 
him and say? "I can give you a better job. I will pay you more 
for driving me to the station than the Government pays you 
for driving the ambulance. You may be on an errand of mercy, 
but get off, I want you to haul me.' You wouldn't do that. 

Suppose you saw a man at work in a factory, making a 
gun or a shell, and you knew that that gun or shell was neces- 
sary for our soldiers. Would you say, ' ' Stop your machinery 
and quit working on guns and shells. I want you to make a 
bicycle for me. If you will work for me I will pay you more 
than the Government. ' You surely would not do that. 

Suppose you saw a woman working at loading shells or 
making a gas mask. Would you say? "I want a new dress 
made. I want a new hat. Stop that work and work for me. ' 
Knowing that the gas mask might save the life of a soldier 
and that the shells are necessary if we are to win the war, you 
certainly would not ask the woman to stop her war work and 
go to work for you. But we are all doing just that thing. We 
don't think. We don't understand that men and women who 
are working for us cannot work for the Government.

THRIFT IN .OARB OF CLOTHING 

"With the prices of clothing advancing all the time and 
with a shortage of clothing material facing us, we must not 
only use economy in buying, but must also make the present 
supply last as long as possible. 

Selection 

When buying garments consider the wearing qualities of 
the material, the fastness of the dye, etc., rather than the pre- 
vailing style in color and weave. 

Garments made at home will wear longer than those ready- 
made, if the materials are carefully chosen, the workmanship 
good, and the garment well fitted. 

Preparation of New Material 

Linens, ginghams, and voiles, or materials which spot or 
lose their shape when they are wet, should be sponged or 
shrunk before making up. A good method of sponging wool 
is to lay the material folded through the center on a wet sheet 
or long piece of muslin. Koll and leave over night. Press on 
the wrong side with a dry cloth laid over the material. A good 
way to shrink cottons or linen is to leave the material folded, 
place in the bath tub, cover with water and leave over night. 
In the morning hang on the line, hanging the selvage edges 
together. When partly dry, press. 

Many garments are discarded before they are much worn 
because they are badly faded. Set colors in cottons and linens 
before making. Set colors in ready-made garments the first 
time they are laundered. 

Protection and Care of Clothing 

Hang clothes on hangers and away from the dust when 
not in use. This saves time in caring for the garments, and pre- 
vents the wearing that results from constant brushing, pressing, 
and cleaning. A good substitute for a skirt hanger may 
be made by placing loops or safety pins at the sides of the 
skirt and hanging them on nails placed in the closet at 
the right distance to keep the bands of the skirt extended. A 
substitute for a coat hanger may be made from a roll of paper 
or a piece of wood covered with muslin with a tape hanger at 



Waste Not Want Not 103 

the center. Have cotton covers made for waists, dresses, and 
coats that are worn only occasionally. 

Sponging, cleaning, and pressing will make wearable many 
a garment which looks shabby. 

Have play clothes for the children and save their good 
ones. 

Wear aprons when at work. There are many attractive 
ones for all kinds of uses. 

Fresh collars and cuffs quite change the appearance of a 
dress. They should be removable, since they need laundering 
more often than the dress. 

Shoes 

Have shoes carefully fitted. 

Shoes wear longer when two pairs are alternated. 

Rubber heels are a help if one wears off heels badly. 

Have heels built up as soon as they wear off, otherwise the 
whole shoe soon runs over and loses its shape. 

Vaseline rubbed on shoes occasionally and allowed to thor- 
oughly dry before using keeps the leather soft and gives it 
greater resistance to water. 

Keep shoes clean and dry. 

Rubbers are a good investment. Soft paper pressed into 
the toes and heels of rubbers will prolong their life. 

Stockings 

Stockings that fit well give longer service. 

The life of stockings may be lengthened if the top is 
stretched and two rows of machine stitching (long stitch) run 
around the stocking just below the hem. This checks the 
runners when they start. 

It is often economy to buy new feet for stockings, espe- 
cially for children. 

A piece of velvet pasted into shoes at the heel will increase 
the wearing qualities of the stockings. 

If the linings of heels of shoes get worn so that they wear 
your stockings, paste cotton wadding or adhesive tape over 
the hole, giving a smooth surface. 

Carefully repair stockings as soon as the need arises. 



104 Our Country's Call to Service 

Fiber-silk stockings must be carefully laundered. Use 
lukewarm water, as hot water weakens fiber. Use good soap. 

Wash stockings frequently, especially silk ones, which will 
last much longer if rinsed out after each day's wear. Perspira- 
tion quickly rots silk. 

Laundering 

Do not allow garments to become too badly soiled before 
washing. 

Launder carefully all colored wash materials. Do not use 
too hot water. Use good white soap. Dry in the shade. Colors 
which have faded may be strengthened. 

Blues use strong bluing. 

Pinks use a little red ink or color from red crepe paper in rinse 
water. 

Yellows and tans use strong coffee in rinse water. 

White crepe de chines which have become yellow after laundering, 
tint by dyes obtained at drug store, or dye from colored crepe paper. 

Do not send fragile waists, collars, etc., to the laundry. 
They should be carefully washed by themselves. 

KEEP A SERVICE RECORD 

Make a little book in which you show under the proper 
dates what you are doing for your country. Decorate the book 
with some appropriate design and name it "My Service Rec- 
ord.' If this book is properly made and your services are 
accurately recorded, you will be proud of it in the years to 
come. Of course, there are some services like speaking words 
of loyalty for your country, being careful not to waste things, 
etc., that you probably cannot show in your record, but there 
are many others that you can. You can make a record of 
deeds actually done, or gifts and sacrifices made.

Questions and Exercises 

1 Make an accurate list of everything you have purchased during 
the last week or two showing how much each article cost. Try to recall 
every expenditure no matter how small. Then check each article that 
you did not absolutely need in order to be healthy and efficient in your 
work. Compare and discuss the lists in your class. How many Thrift 
Stamps could you have bought with the money spent for the things you 
did not need? 



Say "No" to yourself the next time you are tempted to 
spend needlessly, and hand the money to your Government 



2. From the lists mentioned above estimate the total needless ex- 
penditure for your class during the last week or two and tell how many 
War Savings Stamps might have been purchased with the money thus 
spent. Look at page 97 and show how the Government could use this 
money to buy materials necessary to the winning of the war. 

3. As a class exercise, make a list on the blackboard of things pur- 
chased by men and women which they might do without. Discuss each 
article with reference to the material and labor necessary to produce it 
and show how the people who continue to buy it are adding to the diffi- 
culties of winning the war. 

4. Do you think people should continue to build new homes and 
other buildings as usual? Why? 

5. Why has the Ked Cross recently conducted a campaign to collect 
at least 5000 tons of old clothes for the Belgians and French who are 
behind the German lines? Why wouldn't it have been a better plan to 
secure money enough through donations to buy new clothes or the 
goods with which to make them? 

6. About how many pounds of wool or cotton or both are there in a 
boy's suit? A man's suit? A girl's skirt? An overcoat for a boy a 



110 Our Country's Call to Service 

girl, a man, a woman? (Base estimates on materials necessary for gar- 
ments for boys and girls of your age.) 



7. Find out about how many pounds of wool can be taken from a 
sheep that is shorn but once a year. 



8. Name the countries and the states within our country that lead 
in the production of sheep. 

9. Where are the largest clothing manufactories in this country? 

10. Write an autobiography of 5 pounds of wool from the time it 
was on the back of a sheep in Montana until it was worn in the form of 
an overcoat by a man in Ohio. 

Wearing our clothes longer saves goods and services. 

1 

11. Estimate the number of pounds of wool necessary to furnish a 

soldier with one complete equipment for foreign service. (See page 97.) 
Also estimate how many tons of wool it would require to equip the 
2,000,000 American soldiers now under arms. 

12. The Eed Cross plans to supply every soldier with a sweater as 
well as many other things. About how many tons of wool will be 
required for 2,000,000 sweaters? 

13. Show how the war has created an extra demand for cotton also. 

14. Keeping in mind these enormous quantities of material and the 
constant services of tens of thousands of men and women that are 
required in connection with the production, transportation, and manu- 
facture of the goods, what do you think of people who are careless with 
their clothes and are unwilling to wear them after they are slightly 
"out of style"? How do such people hinder the Government in carry- 
ing on the war? What would you suggest that these people should do 
about their demand for clothing and also with the money which they 
would ordinarily spend for it? 

15. Do you know any people who spend too much time playing games, 
riding in automobiles, going to the theater, etc.? Knowing the needs 
of our Government, what do you think these people should do if they 
really want to be loyal? 

16. What do you think of a loafer?

PART FIVE 



THE JUNIOR RED CROSS 



IU 



Our Country's Call to Service 



THE JUNIOR RED CROSS 

'I have a little namesake," the Red Cross said, 
"He's not very old yet, but he's forging right ahead 
In his efforts to help me raise the money and supplies 
For which my hard-worked sister in the other country cries. 

He is raising money rapidly and works with all his might, 
To give the soldiers comfort, if he doesn't help them fight; 
And when the war is over and we know the gain and loss, 
Many hearts will be so grateful for the Junior Red Cross. ' ' 

By a Junior Red Cross Member, Evansville, Indiana. 
The Purpose of the Junior Bed Cross 

What is the Junior Red Cross and why do we have such a 
thing in our schools? 

We all know about the Senior Red Cross, for which so many 
of our mothers and sisters are working; which is sending all 
sorts of bandages to France, to wrap up the wounds of the 
brave men who have been hurt in the terrible war. We know 
that in a time of war, as now, it is sending sweaters and muf- 
flers and hoods and thick socks to keep the soldiers warm ; we 
know that in times of peace it sends help to any city where a 
great storm or a fire or an earthquake has driven people from 
their homes and killed and maimed them. If we know this, the 
best answer that we can give to the question about the Junior 
Red Cross is that it is the child of the Senior Red Cross. For it 
tries to do the same sort of work, in a smaller way. 

We have it in our schools for several reasons. First, our 
boys and girls are anxious to help in winning the war. 

You know the English are a people who very much dislike 
any bragging or boasting. For this reason an Englishman, in 
telling what he is doing, generally tries to make it seem that it 
is very little. So he likes to say, ' ' I am trying to do my bit, ' 
making everybody think that it is only a little bit, even when 
it may be a very big bit. So our American boys and girls like 
to say, "I am doing my bit along with everybody else in help- 
ing to win the war.' 



1'ke J anior Red Cross 



113 



But if every boy and girl went to work making something 
for the soldiers without being told what was most needed, or 
without asking anybody's advice, all sorts of mistakes would 
be made. They might make sweaters when the thing that was 
most needed was plenty of bandages or splints. 

So there must be a head, or a leader, to tell us what sort of 
work 'to do, and just how much of each kind. 









RED CROSS MEN AT WORK ON THE BATTLEFIELD 

The Senior Red Cross is asked for more than it can do. 
Some of these things for which it is asked can be made just as 
well as not by the younger folks. And here the Junior Red 
Cross can help. 

Then, too, it offers a great chance for children to learn 
lessons in love of country, in service, in doing without things 
for the sake of other people, in saving, in helping those 
have suffered cruelly through the war. 



114 



Our -Country's Call to Service 
How It Came to be Organized 



Early in September, 1917, the "War Council of the United 
States voted to invite the children of the nation to take part 
in the work of the Red Cross. 

By the 1st of January, 1918, there were 2,531 different 
school auxiliaries and 860,740 children who had joined. 




BELGIAN ORPHANS BEING FED AND CARED FOR 

This seems a great many, but really it was only a small part 
of the school children of the United States, for there are nearly 
22,000,000 of them all told. So during February, 1918, a hard 
effort was made to get them all to join. Several cities report 
that every child has joined and others are "going over the top' 
every day. To become a member a child has to pay twenty-five 
cents, and this sum looks large to many families who are not 
rich. Of course, it would be easy for some children simply to ask 
their fathers or mothers for the money, but in most cities it is 
asked that the children should earn it. 



The Junior Red Cross 



115 



borne one will say, ''Why ask money?' The answer is, 
first, that the five and a half million dollars which would come 
from the twenty-two million American school children is a 
mighty sum and can do a great deal of good ; second, that it is 
a good thing for a child to give up something that he wants 
in order to supply the much greater wants of other children. 

The money is used to buy supplies from which to make use- 
ful things for the soldiers abroad and the needy children of 
Europe. It is used to pay for the food of some child in France 
or Belgium whose parents have been killed by the Germans. In 
this way a school may "adopt" a French orphan, by agreeing 
to pay a certain sum each year to feed and clothe him. 




FRENCH BOYS BEING TAUGHT CARPENTRY IN SCHOOL ESTABLISHED BY THE 
FRANCO-AMERICAN COMMITTEE, AND SUPPORTED BY THE RED CROSS 

How Members Can Earn Money 

Some schools have helped to raise it by giving entertain- 
ments and charging for the tickets. The boys and girls speak 
pieces, play on the piano, sing, or give tableaux and little plays 
to amuse the audience. 

Some children have earned their money by collecting and 
selling to the junk man tin foil, lead, zinc, wastepaper, old rub- 
ber, etc. This helps save these things, which are badly needed 
in war time, and teaches the children to avoid waste. 



116 Our Country's Call to Service 

Others have gotten people to subscribe to magazines, while 
others have sold seeds for war gardens. 

Still others have given up money that had been given to 
them to spend selfishly for their own pleasure, on candy, gum, or 
' ' movies. ' 

Others run errands, clean up yards, put in coal, wash dishes, 
sweep walks, shovel snow, etc. 

Some are already planting gardens with the idea of selling 
the vegetables that they raise and giving the money to the 
Junior Red Cross. 

What Members Can Do in the Classroom 

Now how can we work for the Junior Red Cross inside the 
school itself? 

In the first place, we can have patriotic exercises every 
morning in the school rooms. Certain children who know it 
well can tell to those in the lower rooms the story of the Red 
Cross, and similar stories of love of country, giving up for 
others, serving and working to win the war. 

In our drawing lessons we can have cartoons and posters 
made, showing how food can be spared and money saved and 
work done for our country. 

Our music can be largely made up of songs of America and 
its friends. Some children have even written words about the 
Red Cross which can be sung to well-known tunes. 

In the language classes, verses and compositions can be 
written about the war and the many ways that children have 
of helping to win it. 

Plays and dialogues on patriotic themes can be written by 
the children and staged and played before audiences. 

Some boys and girls have made up first-class yells about the 
Junior Red Cross. 

In the arithmetic classes problems can be worked that show 
us how much we can give to France, England, and Italy if 
every child in America saves only one lump of sugar a day; 
how much coal is wasted by burning electric lights when they 
are not needed, etc. 

In the history classes pupils can study how the war begf.n 
and why America had to go into it. Every teacher will know 
these facts and will be glad to make the children understand 
the rights and wrongs of the great World War. 



The Junior Red Cross 117 

The boys in the manual training shops can make packing 
boxes in which to send to France bandages and clothes. They 
can build flag poles, can plan and build furniture for the homes 
where sick soldiers live after leaving the hospitals, while they 
are waiting till they get strong enough to go back to fighting. 
They can draw plans for posters and banners, advertising the 
work of the Red Cross. They can make useful things to be 
sold to raise money for Red Cross materials. 

The girls in the household arts classes can make clothes for 
the poor children of France and Belgium who have been 
driven from their homes by the Germans. 

They can knit sweaters and hoods and socks for the sol- 
diers. They can help their teachers to show- all housewives how 
to save food, how to can vegetables, how to use corn and 
syrups and beans instead of the wheat and sugar and meat 
that we have to send to Europe. 

The Junior Red Cross can be the power behind all move- 
ments toward winning the war. Its members will think pa- 
triotism, talk patriotism, act patriotism. "Whether it is a cam- 
paign for thrift stamps, or for saving of coal, or saving of food, 
or any other kind of service, America will not call in vain on 
her future citizens, the members of the Junior Red Cross. 



Try to get every boy and girl in your school to 
join and work for the Junior Red Cross. Remember 
that our country has about 22,000,000 school children. 
If all become members, the Junior Red Cross will be 
the biggest ' ' club ' ' in the world ! You will be proud to 
belong to such a society.

PART SIX 

WHAT IS DEMOCRACY? 

I pledge allegiance to my flag, and to the republic 
for which it stands,, one nation, indivisible, with liberty 
and justice for all. 

ABRAHAM LINCOLN 

Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on 
this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated 
to the proposition that all men are created equal. 

Now we are engaged in a great civil war; testing whether 
thai nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can 
long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of that war. We 
have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting 
place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might 
live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. 

But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate we can not con- 
secrate we can not hallow this ground. The brave men, liv- 
ing and dead, who struggled here have consecrated it far above 
our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor 
long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what 
they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated, 
here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus 
far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated 
to the great task remaining before us that from these honored 
dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they 
gave the last full measure of devotion that we here highly 
resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain that this 
nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom and that 
government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall 
not perish from the earth.

What is Democracy? 119 

JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL 

There can be no doubt that the spectacle of a great and pros- 
perous Democracy on the other side of the Atlantic must react 
powerfully on the aspirations and political theories of men in 
the Old World who do not find things to their mind ; but, whether 
for good or evil, it should not be overlooked that the acorn from 
which it sprang was ripened on the British oak. Every succes- 
sive swarm that has gone out from this officina gentium [mother 
of peoples] has, when left to its own instincts may I not call 
them hereditary instincts? assumed a more or less thoroughly 
democratic form. This would seem to show, what I believe to be 
the fact, that the British Constitution, under whatever disguises 
of prudence or decorum, is essentially democratic. , 

Essay on Democracy. 



THEODORE ROOSEVELT 

Much has been given to us and much will rightfully be ex- 
pected from us. We have duties to others and duties to our- 
selves; and we can shirk neither. We have become a great 
nation, forced by the fact of its greatness into relations with the 
other nations of the earth; and we must behave as beseems a 
people with such responsibilities. Toward all other nations, large 
and small, our attitude must be one of cordial and sincere friend- 
ship. We must show not only in our words but in our deeds 
that we are earnestly desirous of securing their good will by 
acting toward them in a spirit of just and generous recognition 
of all their rights. 

We know that self-government is difficult. We know that 
no people needs such high traits of character as that people 
which seeks to govern its affairs aright through the freely ex- 
pressed will of the freemen who compose it. But we have faith 
that we shall not prove false to the memories of the men of 
the mighty past. They did their work, they left us the splen- 
did heritage we now enjoy. 

Inaugural Address, March 4, 1905. 



120 Our Country's Call to Service 

t 

AMBASSADOR WALTER H. PAGE 

What is the United States? It is a vast territory of great 
resources and a hundred million prosperous people, yes but more. 
The republic is a system of society, a scheme of life, a plan of 
freedom, a state of mind an ideal that every human shall have 
the utmost possible opportunity for individual development and 
that nothing shall be put in the way of that development. It 
was for this and upon this that our fathers established it. This 
we haven't forgotten, nor shall we ever forget. It is to make sure 
that this ideal shall not now perish from the earth that brings 
the United States into this war. High as the cost and great as 
the toll may be, we shall be better for standing where we have 
always stood, whatever the cost. . 

Great Days for the Republic. 



ELIHU ROOT 

To this great conflict for human rights and human liberty 
America has committed herself. There can be no backward step. 
There must be either humiliating and degrading submission or 
terrible defeat or glorious victory. It was no human will that 
brought us to this pass. It was not the President. It was not 
Congress. It was not the press. It was not any political party. 
It was not any section or part of our people. 

It was that in the providence of God the mighty forces that 
determine the destinies of mankind beyond the control of human 
purpose have brought to us the time, the occasion, the necessity 
that this peaceful people so long enjoying the blessings of liberty 
and justice for which their fathers fought and sacrificed shall 
again gird themselves for conflict, and with all the forces of man- 
hood nurtured and strengthened by liberty offer again the sac- 
rifice of possessions and of life itself, that this nation may still 
be free, that the mission of American democracy shall not liave 
failed, that the world shall be free. 

The Duties of the Citizen. 



What is Democracy? 121 

WOODROW WILSON 
(EXTRACTS FROM THE PRESIDENT'S ADDRESSES) 

I am not bound to be loyal to the United States to please 
myself. I am bound to be loyal to the United States because I 
live under its laws and am its citizen, and whether it hurts me or 
whether it benefits me, I am obliged to be loyal. Loyalty means 
nothing unless it has at its heart the absolute principle of self- 
sacrifice. Loyalty means that you ought to be ready to sacrifice 
every interest that you have, and your life itself, if your country 
calls upon you to do so, and that is the sort of loyalty which 
ought to be inculcated into newcomers, that they are not to be 
loyal only so long as they are pleased, but that, having once 
entered into this sacred relationship, they are bound to be loyal 
whether they are pleased or not. 

The School of Citizenship. 



My dream is that as the years go on and the world 'knows 
more and more of America it will also drink at these fountains 
of youth and renewal ; that it also will turn to America for those 
moral inspirations whj.ch lie. at the basis of all freedom; that 
the world will never fear America unless it feels that it is en- 
gaged in some enterprise which is inconsistent with the rights of 
humanity ; and that America will come into the full light of the 
day when all shall know that she puts human rights above all 
other rights and that her flag is the flag not only of America, but 
of humanity. 

A patriotic American is a man who is not niggardly and sel- 
fish in the things that he enjoys that make for human liberty 
and the rights of man. He wants to share them with the whole 
world, and he is never so proud of the great flag under which he 
lives as when it comes to mean to other people as well as to 
himself a symbol of hope and liberty. I would be ashamed of 
this flag if it did anything outside America that we would not 
permit it to do inside of America. 

The Meaning of the Declaration of Independence. 



122 Our Country's Call to Service 

The commands of democracy are as imperative as its privi- 
leges and opportunities are wide and generous. Its compulsion 
is upon as. It will be great and lift a great light for the guid- 
ance of the nations only if we are great and. carry that light 
high for the guidance of our own feet. We are not worthy to 
stand here unless we ourselves be in deed and in truth real dem- 
ocrats and servants of mankind, ready to give our very lives 
for the freedom and justice and spiritual exaltation of the great 
nation which shelters and nurtures us. 

Address on Abraham Lincoln. 



For us there is but one choice. We have made it. Woe be 
to the man or group of men that seeks to stand in our way in 
this day of high resolution when every principle we hold dearest 
is to be vindicated and made secure for the salvation of the na- 
tions. We are ready to plead at the bar of history, and our flag 
shall wear a new luster. Once more we shall make good with 
our lives and fortunes the great faith to which we were born", and 
a new glory shall shine in the face of our people.

with the least trouble or disturbance to present plans. 



An examination of BENEZETS The World War and 
What Was Behind It will show how splendidly it 
meets the problem.

book at once in the Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Grades!
