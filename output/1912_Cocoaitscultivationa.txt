CHAPTER I 

HISTORICAL 

Early Use of Cocoa in Mexico. Cocoa or Cacao of com- 
merce is manufactured from the beans of two or three 
species of small trees indigenous to the forests of tropical 
Central America. It was cultivated and highly appre- 
ciated as a beverage in Mexico and Peru long before 
Columbus discovered the New World, and he was re- 
sponsible for bringing the first tidings of the virtues of 
this important food product to Europe. 

Bernando de Castile, who accompanied Cortez when 
he subjugated Mexico in 1521, describes one of Monte- 
zuma's feasts, at which some fifty jars of cocoa were 
brought in and drunk. The word chocolate is derived 
from the Mexican chocolatl, a sweetmeat, which the 
Mexicans made from cocoa, flavoured with cayenne 
pepper, vanilla, etc. 

In conjunction with various other Mexican products, 
samples of cocoa were sent by Cortez to his royal master, 
Charles V. of Spain, shortly after the conquest of Mexico. 

Under the name of Amygdalae pecuniarce, cocoa beans 
were used by the Mexicans as money, and in Antonio 
de Herrera's History of the West Indies it is stated that 
one of Montezuma's store houses contained 40,000 loads 
of cocoa which had been received as tribute from the 
provinces subject to him. Prescott's Conquest of Peru 
relates that Pizarro's followers saw, as they sailed along 
the Pacific coast, "hill-sides covered with the yellow 
maize and the potato, or checkered in the lower levels 
with blooming plantations of cocoa." 

The Introduction of Cocoa to Europe. Spain was the 
first country in Europe to manufacture cocoa, and mono- 
J 



polised this industry for many years. Monks were 
responsible for the introduction of cocoa into Germany 
and France. Cardinal Richelieu is reported to have been 
cured of a dangerous disease by its use, which was 
undoubtedly a valuable advertisement in its favour in 
France. 

The earliest record of the introduction of cocoa into 
England is contained in a notice in the Public Advertiser, 
dated June 16, 1657, which stated that an excellent 
West Indian drink, called chocolate, was on sale at a 
Frenchman's house in Queen's Head Alley, Bishopsgate 
Street. Early in the eighteenth century it had become 
an exceedingly fashionable beverage : about this time 
the " Cocoa Tree Club " in St. James's Street was a 
recognised rendezvous of the Tory party. Its relatively 
high price, compared with that of tea and coffee, limited 
its use to the wealthy classes for several years. 

Growth of Cocoa Consumption. In 1822 the consump- 
tion of cocoa in England only amounted to about 500,000 
pounds, of which, strange to say, more than one half was 
consumed by the Navy, and this curious feature obtained 
until 1830, when the total consumption was still under 
a million pounds. The extent to which its use has 
increased in popularity is well illustrated by the fact 
that in the United Kingdom the consumption of cocoa 
increased from 2,500,000 pounds in 1848 to 18,000,000 
pounds in 1888, whilst during 1908 it had risen to 
46,000,000 pounds. In other words, the rate of con- 
sumption in the United Kingdom was during the year 
1840 about half an ounce per head of population; in 
1888 it rose to half a pound per head; in 1908 it was 
more than one pound per head. 

With the increased demand for cocoa in Europe its 
cultivation was rapidly extended in Brazil, Ecuador, 
Santo Domingo, and Venezuela. 

From Central America the cultivation of cocoa soon 
spread to the West Indian islands, and as early as 1671 
the cocoa plantations in Jamaica, which had been formed 
by the Spaniards, were destroyed by a " blast."

4 HISTORICAL 

The stocks of cocoa remaining on hand at the end 
of the years 1906, 1907, and 1908, were estimated at 
52,345,058 kilogs., 45,204,647 kilogs., and 78,488,009 
kilogs. respectively. [Kilog. = 2'204 lb.] 

During the years 1898 to 1908 the world's consumption 
of cocoa has risen from 70,000 tons to 164,000 tons, an 
increase of more than 134 per cent. In the same period 
the world's production has increased from 80,000 tons 
to 193,000 tons, or more than 240 per cent. 

It is estimated that the area now under cocoa cultiva- 
tion is more than 2,000,000 acres. 



BOTANICAL 

Origin of Commercial Cocoa. That Linnaeus enter- 
tained a very high opinion of cocoa may be concluded 
from his identifying the genus to which belong the 
species of trees yielding this product, as Theobroma, i.e. 
#eo? (god) and f3p(U[j,a (food). The genus Theobroma is 
included in BUETTNERIACE^}, a tribe of the natural 
order STERCULIACE&, comprising some twenty species, 
all of which occur in the wild state in Central and 
South America. Many of these produce edible seeds 
or beans,* but at present only three species are known 
to yield beans of commercial value : these are Theo- 
broma cacao, L., T. pentagona, Bern., and T. sphcero- 
carpa, Chev. 

The world's cocoa supply is chiefly obtained from 
T. cacao, L. ; until quite recently, it was considered the 
only species productive of commercial cocoa. T. bicolor, 
Plumb., T. sylvestris, Mart., T. leiocarpa, Bern., T. 
angustifolia (T. speciosa, Willd. ex Spreng.), and T. 
ovati folia (T. bicolor, Humb.) are cultivated in Guate- 
mala and Nicaragua, and their beans are mixed 
with those of T. cacao, L., in the local manufacture of 
chocolate. T. cacao, L., has been cultivated for at least 
five hundred years, and, like numerous other plants 
which have been cultivated during long periods, it has 
developed numerous varieties which show marked differ- 
ence from the original type. The following is a brief 
description of T. cacao, L., T. pentagona, Bern., and 
T. sphcerocarpa, Chev.

acuminate, exceeding the yellowish corolla ; pericarp 
yellow or reddish, leathery, 6 to 8 in. long." (Grisebach.) 

DESCRIPTION OF T. pentagona, Bernoulli. 

Habit similar to T. cacao, young shoots and petioles 
very tomantose, hairs white or reddish. Leaves 18 to 
25 cm. (7 to 10 in.) long by 7 to 9 cm. (2f to 3| in.) broad, 
glabrous, of the same shape as T. cacao but of a dark 
green colour, much more papery, convex, at the sides 
more or less incurved downwards, often crisped and 
serrulate-dentate at the extremity. 

Flowers rarely isolated or in pairs, but generally 
grouped in bunches of six to fifteen flowers, each borne 
upon a pedicel inserted directly upon the trunk. Pedicels 
and flower-buds green, not rosy. 

The fruit has distinctly raised, acute-angled ribs on 
the surface, between which lies a warted surface. The 
outer coat is soft and easily penetrated, and when ripe 
is readily broken. Generally yellow in colour, but 
sometimes tinged with red. Cured beans have a fine 
flavour, and are generally larger than beans of T. cacao. 

DESCRIPTION OF T. sphcerocarpa, A. Chevalier. 

Habit more compact than T. cacao. Leaves dark 
green, broad and parchment-like, generally measuring 
from 20 to 25 cm. (8 to 10 in.) long by 9 to 11 cm. (3 
to 4Jin.) broad, with a short and broad point. Flowers 
almost always isolated, produced not only upon the 
trunk and principal branches, but sometimes also upon 
the youngest branches. Young fruits of a dark green 
colour, often tinted with red and almost spherical, 



DIFFERENT VARIETIES OF COCOA 7 

rather deeply ribbed. Mature fruits of a clear yellow 
colour, short, length only from 10 to 12 cm. (4 to 4f in.), 
almost spherical, perfectly round at both extremities, 
and even sometimes a little depressed at the summit. 
Surface smooth, showing ten ribs well marked in the 
upper part, but disappearing towards the centre ; the 
lower half is completely round, without furrows. 

Habitat ; common in cocoa-plantations in San Thome. 

Distinguishing Features of the Forastero and Criollo 
Varieties. For convenience of reference attempts have 
been made to divide up the varieties of T. cacao into 
three divisions, which have been named respectively 
Forastero, Criollo, and Calabacillo. The varieties in- 
cluded under the Forastero and Calabacillo divisions 
are more robust than those belonging to the Criollo 
division, and are generally more hardy. The several 
varieties are, however, best differentiated by the char- 
acters of their fruits and beans. The different forms 
which the fruits of the Forastero varieties assume are 
clearly shown in Plates 1 and 2, which are repro- 
duced from photographs recently taken by the writer 
in San Thome. The fruits marked respectively I, II, 
in, and iv all belong to the Forastero division, and 
clearly show the extraordinary manner in which they 
differ in size and form. Fruits marked I, n, and iv 
are fairly representative of the varieties generally classi- 
fied as Liso Colorado, Liso amarillo, and Amelonado. 
The fruit marked in is a form of Amelonado which the 
writer proposes to distinguish as Amelonado pequeno, 
and that marked vi is a fruit representative of the 
Calabacillo division. If each of these varieties con- 
stantly produced the form of fruit by which it has been 
here distinguished, identification would be an easy 
matter ; but this is by no means the case, for the forms 
of fruit on a single tree frequently show such variation 
that it is possible to select fruits representative of two 
or even three of these varieties. Again, the colour of 
the fruits of a particular variety is also inconstant, as 
it varies from red to bright yellow, and it is not un- 
common to see both red and yellow fruits on the same 
tree. 

The fruits of the Criollo varieties likewise exhibit 
similar diversities in form, size, and colour. The differ- 



8 BOTANICAL 

ences between the Forastero and Calabacillo varieties 
are of such little value for purposes of identification 
that in this work it is not proposed to attempt to dis- 
tinguish between them. We are thus enabled to class 
the varieties of Theobroma cacao, L., under two divisions, 
Forastero and Criollo. The main distinguishing characters 
of these two divisions being that the Criollo varieties 
generally produce fruits with thinner and softer walls 
than the Forastero varieties, although even this dis- 
tinction cannot always be relied upon, as the fruits of 
Amelonado and Amelonado pequeno are sometimes as 
thin and soft as those of some of the Criollo varieties. 
The beans of the Criollo varieties are almost invariably 
rounded and plump, whereas the Forastero varieties 
quite as constantly produce much flatter beans. The 
most important distinction, however, lies in the 
Criollo beans possessing pale or white cotyledons, whilst 
those of the Forastero beans are generally purple. 
Where Criollo and Forastero varieties are cultivated in 
close proximity cross-fertilisation takes place between 
them and the characters of each type may be found 
merged in the progeny. This is a feature extremely 
common in Ceylon cocoa plantations, where it is almost 
impossible to find trees producing white beans only, 
as the writer has shown elsewhere.* 

The cotyledons of the beans of T. pentagona are 
white, while those of the beans of T. sphcerocarpa are 
purple. The fruits of these are readily distinguishable 
from those of T. cacao. The fruits of the first-mentioned 
species are provided with five prominent ridges or wings, 
between which the surface is covered with pronounced 
tubercles. The fruits of T. sphcerocarpa are small and 
rounded, as shown in Plates 1 and 2 v. 

All of the three species of Theobroma previously de- 
scribed are evergreen trees, with a short erect trunk ; 
the height of cultivated trees varies from 12 to 40 ft. 

The Production of Cocoa Flowers and Fruits. The 
greatest number of flowers are produced on the stem and 
principal branches, and a tree may continue to bear 
flowers and fruits from the same areas for many consecu- 
tive years. Swellings or cushions are eventually formed 

* Johnson's Report on the Cultivation of Rubber, Cocoa, and other 
Agricultural Products in Ceylon, 1903. 



COCOA FLOWERS AND FRUITS 9 

at these points as is shown in Plate 7. Flowers may 
be found on the trees throughout the year, but the 
greatest number are usually present about six months 
antecedent to the principal crop season. As many as 
27,000 flowers have been found upon a tree at one time, 
but the average number produced by a single tree per 
year is approximately 6,000. The average number 
of fruits which a healthy cocoa tree matures per year is 
approximately seventy, so that only about 1 per cent, 
of the flowers yields mature fruits. 

Cocoa flowers are so constructed that outside aid 
appears to be essential for pollination. Uzel, who 
investigated this subject in Ceylon, came to the con- 
clusion that they are solely pollinated by thrips, and 
that these insects occurred more abundantly in sunlight 
than in shade. Many other insects are doubtlessly 
instrumental in this connection in other countries where 
thrips are not plentiful. 

Five or six months usually elapse between floration 
and fruit maturation. The beans are arranged in the 
fruits in five longitudinal rows ; ten beans may be 
traced in each row, but rarely more than forty-five 
properly developed beans are found. 

Dimensions of the Flowers and Fruits of Different Varieties. 
The size, weight, and form of the fruits vary consider- 
ably in different varieties. The writer obtained the 
under-mentioned averages by examining one hundred 
fruits of each of five of the varieties illustrated in Plates 
1 and 2.

CHAPTER III 

CLIMATIC REQUIREMENTS OF COCOA TREES 

A REVIEW of the climatic conditions obtaining in some 
of the most important cocoa-producing countries will 
best enable us to understand the cocoa tree's require- 
ments in this respect. 

BRAZIL 

The largest cocoa-producing country is Brazil, which 
contributes more than 16 per cent, of the world's cocoa 
supply ; more than 80 per cent, of Brazilian cocoa being 
produced in the province of Bahia. San Salvador, the 
capital of Bahia, is situated in 13 South latitude and 
30 20' West longitude. The average temperature of 
Bahia is given as 76 Fahr. In the interior of this 
province an average annual rainfall of 58 in. is obtained, 
while that of the district in which the town of Bahia 
is situated is 80 ins. 

ECUADOR 

The second largest cocoa-producing country, Ecuador, 
is traversed by the Equator. Cocoa is principally grown 
in the lower coast region. In Guayaquil, which is prob- 
ably the most important cocoa district, the thermometric 
mean is 83 Fahr. 

The rainy season extends from December to May, 
with a brief period of dry weather shortly after the 
December solstice ; a little rainy season occurring after 
the September equinox. 

In the cocoa-growing districts the climate is generally 
hot and moist, and has been described as resembling 
the " steaming atmosphere of the carboniferous period." 
At Quito the average annual rainfall is reported to be 
40 in., but as much as 78 in. falls in the Amazon valley. 

11 



12 CLIMATIC REQUIREMENTS OF COCOA TREES 

SAN THOM 

The small Portuguese island of San or Sao Thome pos- 
sesses a perfect climate for cocoa cultivation. It is 
situated in the Gulf of Guinea immediately north of the 
Equator, about 160 miles distant from the West Coast 
of Africa. The annual average rainfall at sea-level is 
given as 40 in., but it is probably more than double 
this amount in the hilly districts in the interior of the 
island where most of the cocoa is grown. Except during 
a short dry season or gravanha, which generally occurs 
between July and September, rain falls at fairly frequent 
intervals all through the year, and the climate is ex- 
ceedingly moist and oppressive. The temperature ranges 
between 60 and 80 Fahr. in the so-called cool season, 
and between 70 and 90 Fahr. in the hot season. 



TRINIDAD 

This West Indian island lies between 10 3' and 10 50' 
North latitude. The meteorological observations regis- 
tered at the Botanical Gardens during thirty-five years 
show an annual average rainfall of 65' 49 in., but in 
the wettest districts the rainfall often is as high as 
100 in. per annum. The mean annual relative humidity 
is given as 78, taking saturation at 100. At sea-level 
the mean temperature is 78' 1 Fahr., and ranges from 
69 to 89 Fahr. According to Olivieri (Treatise on 
Cacao), the rainy season extends from June to December, 
the driest months being February, March, and April, 
and the wettest months July and August. 

SANTO DOMINGO 

Another West Indian island, Santo Domingo, is 
situated between 17 37' and 20 North latitude. It is 
essentially mountainous, but there are numerous large 
fertile plains between the various ranges. In the plains 
it is generally hot and moist, the temperature often 
rising to 96 Fahr., and occasionally even to 100 Fahr. 
There is a well-marked wet and dry season, rains being 
most frequent and heaviest in May and June ; the 
average annual rainfall is 60 in. 



HUMIDITY OF THE GOLD COAST CLIMATE 13 

VENEZUELA 

In the South American Republic of Venezuela, which 
lies between 1 40' and 12 26' North latitude, cocoa 
is principally cultivated in the warm, moist, lower 
lands. At Guayara, which is the principal seat of the 
cocoa trade, the mean temperature is 85 Fahr. The 
temperature is, however, considerably moderated by 
the trade winds, and great extremes of heat are not 
met with. The rainy season proper at Guayara only 
lasts about three months, May to August, but is more 
extended in the hills. In many districts it is thus only 
possible to cultivate cocoa successfully by the aid of 
irrigation. The hottest periods are the middle of April 
and the end of August. The average annual rainfall 
at Caracas is 31' 5 in. ; that of Maracaibo, the Caribbean 
Coast, the Gulf of Paria, and along the Orinoco, is 70, 
65, 63 and 60 in. respectively. 

WEST AFRICA 

In West Africa cocoa is more or less cultivated from 
8 North latitude to 8 South latitude. It is more 
extensively planted in the Gold Coast than in any other 
part of the West African Coast, and more cocoa is ex- 
ported from that Colony than from all the other West 
African Colonies. 

The principal districts in the Gold Coast where cocoa 
is cultivated are in the neighbourhood of Aburi, 
where, at the Botanic Gardens, meteorological observa- 
tions have been regularly recorded for many years. 
Below are given the means of ten years' records.

The most striking feature of these records is the small 
rainfall as compared with that of most other cocoa- 
growing countries. In several parts of West Africa 
the rainfall exceeds 100 in. per annum. At Aburi the 
low rainfall is no doubt compensated for by the humidity 
of the atmosphere. In Kandy, one of the principal 
cocoa-growing districts in Ceylon, the average mean 
annual relative humidity is given as 78; that of Trinidad 



14 CLIMATIC REQUIREMENTS OF COCOA TREES 

is similar, whilst that of Aburi, as shown above, is 85' 20. 
The rainfall at Aburi is exceedingly well distributed, 
for a reference to the meteorological records shows that 
rain almost invariably falls during every month of the 
year. (See also Dudgeon's Agricultural and Forest 
Products of West Africa.) 

CEYLON 

As representative of the climate of cocoa-growing 
countries in the East Indies that of Ceylon may be 
taken. This fertile island lies between 5 55' and 9 51' 
North latitude. The rainfall, in the districts where 
cocoa is principally grown, varies from about 75 to 122 in. 
per annum ; the average mean annual humidity is 78, 
and the average annual temperature 74' 5 Fahr. There 
are two monsoons in the year, called respectively the 
south-west and the north-east ; the former usually 
arrives between the 10th and 20th of May, and the 
latter between the end of October and the middle of 
November. February and March are the driest months ; 
the two following months are hotter, but the atmosphere 
is more humid ; during the remaining months of the 
year rainy weather prevails. 

Broadly speaking, cocoa cultivation is limited to lands 
lying between 20 North latitude and 20 South latitude. 
Even within these limits cocoa cultivation is seldom 
profitable at a higher elevation than 2,000 ft., nor where 
a protracted dry season obtains. 

The whole of the region lying south of the Equator 
in South East Africa is unsuited for cocoa cultivation, 
principally on account of the period of drought, which 
usually extends from May to September, but there are 
several suitable localities in the Protectorate of Uganda. 

The cocoa tree flourishes best in countries possessing 
a hot, equable, moist climate and a well-distributed 
rainfall. The amount of the rainfall is not so im- 
portant provided it be well distributed throughout the 
year and there be an abundance of humidity in the 
atmosphere during the greater part of the year. 

Countries where droughts and great extremes of 
temperature obtain are therefore most unlikely to prove 
profitable for the cultivation of cocoa. 



CHAPTER IV 



SOIL REQUIREMENTS OF THE COCOA TREE 

The Chemistry of the Cocoa Tree. As the cocoa tree 
is mainly dependent on the soil for its nutrition a 
consideration of its chemical components will afford 
an indication of its requirements in this respect. The 
chemistry of the cocoa tree has been investigated by 
Harrison in British Guiana, Cockrane in Ceylon, Marcano 
in Venezuela, and Jumelle furnishes valuable data of 
this nature in his book Le Cacaoyer. 

Jumelle gives the following ash analyses of a cocoa 
tree twenty years of age.

Cockrane found by his investigations in Ceylon that 
the trunk and principal branches represent 50' 2 per cent., 
leaves and small branches 36' 6 per cent., and the roots 
13'2 per cent, respectively of the whole tree. He 
found the proportion of organic matter to be highest 
in the beans, trunk, and principal branches, and lowest 
in the leaves and fruit-shells ; also the highest percentage 
of nitrogen in the beans and lowest in the stem, and the 
ash constituents lowest in the beans and highest in the 
leaves, small branches, and fruit-shells. His analyses of 
the ash of the cocoa tree are as follows :

The Report of the Ceylon Botanical Gardens for 
1908 states: "The analysis of the young and old cocoa 
leaves, to ascertain the storage and transference of 
inorganic constituents during and after the periods of 
rapid growth, is interesting as showing the increase 
of potash and phosphoric acid in the more actively 
growing parts and their transference to other parts of 
the trees when the leaves are ready to fall. 

"A marked feature is the large proportion of silicates 
in the older leaves, amounting to from 43 to 54 per cent, 
of the ash, and apparently chiefly combined with lime 
and magnesia, while the potash and phosphoric acid in 
the young red leaves and twigs amount to about 35 
per cent, and 10 per cent, respectively ; in the older 
leaves they only amount to 5 per cent, and 2'5 per cent., 
and fallen leaves have still less. The ratio of lime, 
magnesia, potash, and phosphoric acid in the ash of the 
young leaves is as 6:4:2: 1, showing the necessity of 
ample, easily available lime and magnesia in the soil, 
as well as potash, if the growth of the cocoa is to be 
luxuriant." 

Harrison recorded the constituents in the various 
parts of the fruit of the Forastero and Calabacillo 
varieties as follows :

Wright, Theobroma Cacao or Cocoa, has drawn up the 
subjoined table from Marcano and Cockrane's investi- 
gations, in Venezuela and Ceylon respectively, to show 
the chemical ingredients in the trees occupying an acre 
of land : 

COMPOSITION OF ONE ACRE OF COCOA TREES 



Nitrogen 
Lime

Potash 
Phosphoric acid 

The quantitative variations in these analyses are no 
doubt attributable to the different ages of the trees in 
the two countries, and to the fact that Cockrane's analyses 
include roots. 

The Chemical and Physical Characters of Cocoa Soils. 
The relatively high percentages of lime and potash in the 
foregoing analyses are specially noteworthy as indicative 
of the cocoa tree's demands in these respects. It is, how- 
ever, important to bear in mind that a chemical analysis of 
a soil does not always indicate the amount of plant-food 
present in a soluble form and available for a plant's im- 
;f mediate use. Still, it is significant that soils which pro- 
duce good crops of cocoa are generally rich in potash. 

Hart (Cacao] furnishes the following analyses of good 
and poor cocoa soils as determined in British Guiana :

A soil may have all the chemical constituents necessary 
for plant nutrition, but if it is not in a good physical 
condition satisfactory results will not be obtained. 
This is another important reason why a chemical analysis 
of a soil is often by itself of little value. Heavy clays 
or water-logged soils are unsuited to cocoa cultivation, 
as also are briny soils, such as those often found on 
low-lying lands near the sea-shore. 

On new lands the character of the indigenous vege- 
tation frequently furnishes a valuable guide to the 
prospective planter. Land on which nothing but poor, 
scrubby vegetation is found is most unlikely to be 
suitable. When planted in shallow land good returns 
are sometimes obtained for a few years, but as soon 
as the tree's roots have traversed the rich layer of surface- 
soil and encounter a sterile stratum below, the tree is 



20 SOIL REQUIREMENTS OF THE COCOA TREE 

starved, its productive powers are decreased, and death 
follows, either through lack of nutrition or disease, for 
if an epidemic be present a tree in a bad state of health 
is more likely to be seriously affected than a healthy 
one. 

Characteristic Root-system of a Cocoa Tree. Plate 3 
well illustrates the characteristic root-system of a cocoa 
tree. Although only seven years of age the " tap " 
root was 8 ft. long, and many of the extremities of the 
so-called surface-feeding roots were 12 ft. distant from 
the trunk. The cocoa tree develops an unusually long 
" tap " root as compared with that of many other 
species of trees of similar size. This amply demon- 
strates how very necessary it is for the cocoa planter to 
investigate the character of the sub-soil before deciding 
upon a site for his plantation. A water-logged sub- 
soil is quite as detrimental to the tree's development as 
a hard, stony one ; stagnant water destroys the hygienic 
conditions which are so essential for healthy root growth. 
Roots in such areas are more subject to fungoid attacks, 
as will be shown in the chapter devoted to pests. 

Biological Condition of Soil. The quantity of plant- 
food available in a soluble form is largely affected by 
the number of nitrifying and other bacteria present. 
Under favourable conditions these micro-organisms act 
upon the nitrogenous compounds of organic matter 
which are present in most soils, changing them into 
ammonia and ultimately to nitrates, in which state they 
form a soluble plant-food. For the life and multiplica- 
tion of soil-bacteria, air, moisture, and heat are essential. 
Water-logged land is invariably sour and inadequately 
aerated, conditions which are inimical to the life of 
soil-bacteria. Drainage operations would probably render 
such lands fertile, but this operation should of course 
depend upon the necessary expenditure. It will in most 
instances be found more economical to choose a better 
site. 

Soil Moisture. Stagnant water must not be confused 
with soil moisture, for a humid soil is a most valuable 
auxiliary to successful cocoa cultivation. The soil's 
power of retaining moisture is largely dependent upon 
the amount of organic matter which it contains. Light, 
sandy soils are invariably lacking in this respect, and 



IMPORTANCE OF ORGANIC MATTER IN SOIL 21 

their choice for cocoa cultivation is consequently un- 
desirable unless ample means are available for supplying 
the deficiency by the application of heavy dressings of 
humus-producing materials, such as animal or vegetable 
matter. 

The most favourable soils for cocoa cultivation are 
those which have been enriched by the yearly leaf-fall 
in forest regions, or by alluvial deposits impregnated 
with various organic matters. The striking development 
of the San Thome cocoa industry is a good example of 
the adaptability of such soils for the growth of cocoa. 
All the best plantations are situated on land cleared of 
forests, where the leaves annually shed have been con- 
verted by natural agencies into a rich, black, vegetable 
mould, in many cases more than a foot deep. These 
lands have been, and are still being, enriched with valuable 
fertilising materials carried down by the tropical rains 
from the neighbouring hills. It is mainly from this 
rich, upper layer of soil that the trees derive their nutri- 
tion by means of a veritable network of fibre us roots, 
for the sub-soil is frequently found to be composed of a 
sandy clay. Experiments conducted at the Minnesota 
Agricultural Experiment Station to test the retentive 
power for moisture of various soils, show that 100 pounds 
each of sand, clay, and humus are able to retain 25 to 
30 pounds, 40 to 50 pounds, and 180 to 190 pounds of 
water respectively. Humus improves both the physical 
and biological condition of a soil by rendering it more 
porous. 



CHAPTER V 

LAYING OUT A COCOA PLANTATION 

Wind-breaks. Where strong winds are prevalent a 
sheltered position should be chosen for the plantation, 
as the foliage of the eocoa tree is peculiarly susceptible 
to damage from wind when unprotected from them. 
Trees in exposed situations are at times completely 
divested of young, tender foliage by their agency ; and 
even the soft wood of new growths becomes dried up 
and killed through the same cause. Planters frequently 
attribute to disease the injuries due to wind and lack 
of shade ; this is not altogether surprising, for the curled, 
shrivelled-up appearance of the young foliage injured 
by wind is entirely dissimilar to the well-known shredded, 
ragged aspect which the wind often imparts to larger 
foliage. Unprotected plantations near the sea-shore 
appear to be most seriously damaged ; this is probably 
attributable to the salt-laden breezes, which not only 
destroy all young foliage, but discolour and then shred 
that which is fully developed. Many trees which afford 
suitable wind-breaks inland v, ill not thrive near the 
sea-coast. The Japanese Lilac, Melia Azedarack, flourishes 
near the sea-coast, even in brackish soil, as also does the 
Coco-nut Palm, Cocos nucifera, and the giant Bamboo, 
Bambusa arundinaceu. Planted in such situations these 
three species would form a most efficient wind-break. 

When forest land is being cleared, and is plentiful and 
cheap, belts of indigenous trees may be left to serve as 
wind-breaks. If forest trees are not available, or should 
it be considered preferable to plant wind-breaks, trees 
of economic value should be chosen for this purpose, 
avoiding those liable to be broken by the wind. Besides 
sheltering the cocoa they would serve as disease-checking 
belts, provided that the species chosen are unrelated 
to cocoa. 

22 



ECONOMIC TREES AS WIND-BELTS 23 

Trees suitable for Wind-belts. There are a variety of 
trees which commend themselves for obvious reasons, 
but preference should be given to those requiring similar 
soil and climatic conditions to those in which the cocoa 
tree flourishes. The Para rubber tree, Hevea brasiliensis, 
Mull. Arg., at once suggests itself as a suitable tree to 
employ for this purpose, since it is not seriously affected 
by wind when the trees are planted close to each other. 
The Rambong rubber tree, Ficus elastica, Roxb., the 
Ofruntum rubber tree, Funtumia elastica, Stapf, and 
the West African Memleku rubber tree, Ficus Vogelii, 
are likewise well adapted for wind-breaks, as also are 
the following fruit trees : Bread Fruit, Artocarpus incisa ; 
Avocado Pear, Persea gratissima ; Sour Sop, Anona 
muricata ; Mango, Mangifera indica ; Guava, Psidium 
Guava ; and Mammee Apple, Mammea americana. 

The Jak Fruit, Artocarpus integri folia, yields both 
edible seeds and a useful timber. Its large leaves, which 
are produced in dense masses, admirably adapt it for 
a wind-shelter, and it is largely employed in San Thome 
for this purpose. In the same island several species of 
Cinchona have been planted as wind-breaks in cocoa 
plantations situated in the hilly districts. It is, how- 
ever, doubtful whether these species could be generally 
employed, as they require a higher elevation than that 
at which the cocoa tree thrives. 

Amongst the timber trees which could be planted 
with advantage are Red Sandal wood, Adenanthera 
pavonina ; Lebbek, Albizzia Lebbek ; West Indian 
Cedar, Cedrela odorata ; Michelia Champaca ; and various 
species of Eucalyptus. 

Clearing Land for Cocoa Cultivation. When clearing 
new land for cocoa plantations some planters prefer to 
leave a certain number of the indigenous trees to serve 
as shade for the cocoa. This practice is common in West 
Africa and in San Thome. Where steep slopes are to 
be planted the roots of the trees which are left standing 
will certainly tend to hold the soil together and prevent 
heavy rains washing it away. As it is impossible to 
leave trees standing at uniform distances apart, regular 
shading by this method is impracticable. They are very 
subject to be uprooted by the wind when those trees 
which previously protected them have been removed, 



24 LAYING OUT A COCOA PLANTATION 

As this frequently occurs several years after the planta- 
tion has been established many valuable cocoa trees 
are destroyed by the fall of the huge, foliage-laden 
branches. It therefore will be found preferable to clear 
all vegetation from the land to be planted, arid plant 
the necessary shade trees at regular distances apart. 
In felling useful timber trees the prudent planter will 
arrange to preserve a good supply of logs for buildings, 
drying platforms, fermenting-houses, bridges, and similar 
purposes. 

All brush and wood not required should be burnt. 
The extraction of large tree stumps is a costly operation, 
but it can be facilitated considerably by scraping the 
soil off the large surface-roots, piling on them a large 
stack of brushwood and firing it. By this means the 
base of the trunk and the largest stumps of the main 
roots often may be completely destroyed, or at any 
rate burnt to such an extent that they can be quickly 
chopped out. Stump-extractors should be employed to 
remove all the small tree stumps. If left in the ground, 
many tree stumps develop new growths which require 
constant lopping. 

The ashes resulting from the burning, if spread over 
the land, will provide a valuable fertiliser, as they contain 
rich supplies of potash and phosphoric acid. 

Plotting out the Plantation. If no plan exists of the 
estate it is advisable to have it surveyed and a plar 
made. The whole area should then be divided into 
rectangular preferably square blocks to facilitate the 
keeping of records, inspection, and for reference purposes. 
Taking as a base-line the longest boundary line, com- 
mencing at one end pegs are put in at 10 chains apart. 
Lines at right angles to the base-line should now be 
made through these points, then starting from the base- 
line pegs should be placed 10 chains apart on the lines 
made at right angles to the base-line. Each peg will 
mark the corner of a square block, which is approximately 
10 acres in area. To fix these points permanently, 
plant a particular tree or shrub, each with a distinctive 
mark or number. If each block be numbered in rotation 
reference may be made to any line of trees in a block, 
or even to a single tree in a particular block, by mentioning 
the number of the block and the number of the line and 



LIGHT RAILWAYS ON COCOA ESTATES 25 

tree counting from a particular direction. The size of 
the blocks may be varied from 5, 15, to 20 acres by 
fixing points on the lines running at right angles to the 
base at 5, 15, or 20 chains apart respectively. 

A uniformly laid-out estate will then be obtained, 
which will considerably facilitate allotting and con- 
trolling task-work. 

It is advisable to mark the blocks with their respective 
numbers on the estate plan. 

Roads. A proper system of well-maintained roads is 
necessary on every cocoa estate. When possible they 
should be demarcated before planting operations com- 
mence. On estates where no steep lands occur the main 
roads might with advantage form the divisions of the 
10-acre blocks, with intermediate paths to serve as feeders. 
This system of communication is of course not practic- 
able where steep lands are planted, for it is advisable 
to take roads alongside such slopes, both to prevent 
excessive washing of the soil by heavy rains and to 
facilitate transport. As transport on such areas is more 
difficult than on moderately level lands more roads are 
desirable, and their distance apart ought not to exceed 
5 chains. Light railways could be employed with ad- 
vantage more generally on cocoa estates. Light four- 
wheeled trolleys, furnished with safe-brakes, can be run 
on rails at more than double the speed and with less than 
half the power required for the haulage of ordinary 
estate carts or wagons. The necessity for expediting 
the conveyance of shelled cocoa-beans to the fermenting- 
house will be dealt with subsequently. 

Drainage. It must not be inferred that drainage is 
unnecessary because the cocoa tree flourishes in a humid 
soil, for its roots are quite as susceptible to injury from 
stagnant water as from drought. Water drains away 
far more rapidly from a loose soil than from a compact 
one. Land with a heavy clay sub-soil requires particular 
care in the matter of drainage, but the surface-soil often 
exhibits no indication of the stagnant water below. 
The trees in such situations carry sickly, yellowish 
foliage, for the air is unable to circulate and promote 
the hygienic conditions so essential for healthy root 
development. Tiled or closed drains of any description 
are impracticable on a cocoa estate, as they rapidly become 



26 LAYING OUT A COCOA PLANTATION 

choked with roots. Full advantage should be taken 
of natural ravines and water-courses by leading drains 
into them, following the lie of the road as much as possible. 
The size of the drains and their distance apart must be 
governed by the character of the soil and the contour of 
the land. More drains are necessary on heavy land than 
on that of an open, porous nature. Generally speaking, 
drains 18 in. wide by 2 ft. deep and from 45 to 50 ft. 
apart will be found sufficient, It is erroneous to suppose 
that drains are unnecessary on hill-slopes, for they are 
of great value in preventing the washing away of rich 
surface-soil which otherwise occurs during heavy rains. 
In such situations a system of smaller and more numerous 
drains will be found more effective than that described 
above. In digging them the soil should always be thrown 
on the lower side of the drain. When completed, the 
whole drainage system of the estate should be inspected 
after the first heavy rain, as any necessary alteration can 
then be noted and rectified when a favourable opportunity 
presents itself. To ensure the efficient working of the 
drains it is necessary to keep them clear of the silt and 
debris which collects in them after heavy rain. As soon 
as the roads arid drains are in satisfactory working order 
it will be found convenient to mark them on the estate 
plan for reference purposes. 

Distance Apart to plant Cocoa Trees. It is impossible to 
lay down any hard and fast rules regarding the distance 
to plant cocoa trees apart. The different varieties vary 
considerably in habit, and a variety which in one country 
develops into a small compact tree may in another 
develop into a much more vigorous tree, owing to differ- 
ences of soil and climate. The Criollo varieties, Theo- 
broma pentagona and T. sphcerocarpa grow more slowly 
and produce smaller trees than Ihe Forastero varieties. 

Twelve feet may be considered a fair average dis- 
tance to plant the first mentioned types apart, and 
15 ft. is usually sufficient for the latter. Trees which 
have been planted too closely should be thinned out 
immediately crowding is evident, The disastrous effect 
of too close planting is well demonstrated by the drawn, 
straggly trees shown in the photograph (Plate 4). 
It is incorrect to assume that the best crops will be ob- 
tained from lands which carry the greatest number of 



THE ROOT-SYSTEM OF COCOA TREES 27 

trees. Unless a cocoa tree has sufficient space to develop 
its foliage properly its fruit-producing capacity must be 
restricted. On the other hand, if an unnecessarily large 
space be left between the trees the roots will suffer by 
the undue exposure of the soil to the sun, and the foliage 
will be needlessly exposed to both wind and sun. Should 
the cultivation of catch crops be objected to, the cocoa 
trees might be planted much closer together than here 
suggested. This would enable a much larger crop to 
be gathered during the first few fruiting years of the 
plantation, and alternate trees could be destroyed as 
considered necessary. By the adoption of this plan the 
ground would be well shaded, and the roots of the trees 
would hold the soil together and prevent the excessive 
wash-away which sometimes occurs on widely planted 
estates where no catch crops are planted. In this 
connection it is, however, important to bear in mind that 
a cocoa tree often produces lateral roots 12 ft. long ; 
the comparatively young tree shown in Plate 3 had 
lateral roots 12 ft. long, with a tap-root 8 ft. deep in the 
ground. 

Lining. If the suggestions offered under the heading 
" Plotting out the Plantation " have been adopted the 
work of marking the points where the cocoa and shade 
trees are to be planted will be a comparatively simple 
matter. A surveying pole, or any other straight pole 
about 8 ft. long, is placed at each corner of one of the 
blocks; then standing at one corner an assistant puts in 
three or four poles approximately equidistant and in 
a straight line between the two corner poles on one side 
of the block. A surveying chain or a rope is used, marked 
by means of coloured cloth or similar material at every 
15 ft. supposing this to be the distance apart the cocoa 
trees are to be planted and, starting from one of the 
end poles, pegs are put in corresponding with the cloth 
marks. This operation is repeated at the opposite side 
of the block. By the same method pegs are placed 
15 ft. apart between the first-placed peg on either side 
of the block, and so on all through the block. If care be 
taken to plant the cocoa trees as near as possible to the 
points marked by the pegs they will be at a uniform 
distance apart. The slightly additional labour which 
lining involves is more than compensated for by the ; 



28 LAYING OUT A COCOA PLANTATION 

symmetrical appearance of the estate and the fact that 
it contains the greatest number of trees which can be 
profitably grown. Where lining is not practised, a certain 
number of trees will be always found planted too closely 
together, while others have an unnecessarily large area 
allotted to them and ground space is wasted. 

Holing. It will considerably facilitate the growth of 
the young cocoa plants if the ground be carefully prepared 
for their reception. A month or two before transplanting 
takes place holes about 3 ft. square and 2 ft. deep should 
be dug ; the sub-soil being thrown into a heap alongside 
the hole. On steep hill-slopes this soil is best placed on 
the lower side of the hole. 

If water stagnates in the holes this indicates that 
drainage is necessary and must receive attention before 
planting commences. A few days previous to trans- 
planting the young cocoa plants the holes should be 
rilled with any rich surface-soil in the neighbourhood. 
Should this not be available it is advisable to place a 
good layer of animal manure at the bottom of the hole. 
If it be decided to sow beans " at stake," i.e. at the points 
allotted to the cocoa trees, three or four beans should be 
sown at the commencement of the rainy season at each 
peg and protected by erecting a small framework of 
palm-leaves or similar material over them. Should more 
than one bean germinate all except the strongest must 
be removed when the plants are about a foot high. This 
method of propagation is impracticable when frequent 
periods of dry weather occur during the rainy season, 
as the young cocoa trees demand a moist soil during the 
first four or five months of their existence.

CHAPTER VI 

SHADING AND INTER-CROPS FOR COCOA 

It is universally acknowledged that shade is necessary 
for young cocoa trees ; whether it is absolutely essential 
for mature trees has been the subject of a great deal of 
controversy. A too dense shade is conducive to the 
growth of the various fungus diseases to which the 
cocoa tree is subject and checks the development of 
flowers and fruits by excluding air and light. Plate 5 
shows a too densely shaded cocoa plantation in San 
Thome", and Plate 4 the ill effects on the cocoa 
trees beneath, which have been too closely planted 
together. The latter are drawn, straggly specimens, and 
although the photograph was taken during the cropping 
season scarcely a fruit is to be seen . The species employed 
for the first mentioned purpose are termed temporary 
shading agents, and those for the latter permanent 
shading agents. We will consider the latter first. 

Permanent Shade for Cocoa Trees. In connection wilh 
this question it is well to remember that the cocoa tree is a 
native of forest regions, and in view of its low habit must 
receive a certain amount of shade from the species of 
larger trees which inhabit tropical forests. Cocoa has been 
successfully cultivated without shade in Grenada for many 
years, and the planters in that island affirm that it is 
not only unnecessary but injurious to this product. Faw- 
cett considers that shade is not required for mature cocoa 
trees in Jamaica. On the other hand, Trinidad planters 
just as emphatically maintain that shade is essential 
in their cocoa plantations. Cocoa is almost invariably 
shaded in Surinam, but Dr. Van Hall, who has devoted 
a great deal of time to the study of the cocoa industry 
in that country, has stated that although the rainy season 
is followed by three very dry months, if the shade were 

29 



30 SHADING AND INTER-CROPS FOR COCOA 

properly removed cocoa could be grown there without it. 
Permanent shade for cocoa is generally considered neces- 
sary in Central America, Ceylon, Trinidad, Fiji, Tobago, 
British Honduras, Samoa, and the whole of West Africa, 
including San Thome. 

If a planter has doubts as to the beneficial effects of 
shade it would be most unwise for him to remove it 
all at once. The shade might be reduced by degrees 
from a small selected area and the effects noted. His 
decision should not be made from the results observed 
during a single year in view of the varying climatic 
conditions which many countries experience during 
different years. 

In countries where cocoa is grown a planter establish- 
ing a new plantation should be guided by the methods 
adopted on the most promising plantations. The amount 
of shade required is to a very large extent dependent 
upon the climatic conditions which obtain. Shade trees, 
in addition to protecting the cocoa tree from the sun, 
act as a wind-break and assist in preserving soil-moisture 
during periods of drought. 

Greater shade is therefore required where strong winds 
prevail and also where dry weather is experienced at 
certain periods of the year. In choosing shade trees 
for such regions it is therefore important not to employ 
those which shed their foliage at the season when their 
protection is most required. 

The trees most largely employed are those which belong 
to the natural order LEGU MINOS AS, probably because 
they are considered to be less exhaustive of soil nitrogen 
as they are enabled to fix atmospheric nitrogen and 
add it to the soil by the aid of the bacteria associated 
with the nodules on their roots. 

The Merits and Demerits of different Shade-Trees. The 
following are common leguminous trees recommended 
for permanent shade purposes : 

Erythrina velutina, E. umbrosa, E. lithosperma, E. 
indica, E. ovalifolia, Albizzia moluccana, A. stipulate* ', 
Pithecolobium Saman and Gliricidia maculata. 

The first two mentioned are largely used in Trinidad 
and to a less extent in some of the other West Indian 
islands, Ceylon, and Guam. In Trinidad they are planted 
at distances varying from 40 to 50 ft. apart. They 



VALUE OF LEGUMINOUS TREES AS SHADE 31 

yield no commercial product ; even their wood is of no 
value. They are objectionable on account of frequently 
losing their leaves during the dry season. E. umbrosa 
was planted for shading cocoa in the Botanic Gardens, 
Aburi, Gold Coast, but as it was invariably leafless during 
the dry, harmattan season it was cut down and Pitheco- 
lobium Saman (Rain Tree) was substituted. 

This tree proved satisfactory for several years. The 
Acting Director, in a letter to the writer dated October 
1909, on this subject remarks: " They have made such 
rapid growth during the last year that I am afraid they 
will soon do more harm than good. Still the cocoa is 
doing remarkably well under them, and in the centre 
block they look exceptionally healthy." 

In St. Lucia Erythrina indica is reported to give better 
results than E. velutina and E. umbrosa, as its shade can 
be more easily controlled by pruning. 

Albizzia moluccana is an evergreen tree indigenous 
to the Moluccas and Java. It is a large, rapidly growing 
tree, with a trunk 3 or 4 ft. in diameter and 70 or 80 ft. 
high. It produces a dense shade, which is inclined to 
encourage the spread of fungus diseases. Possibly this 
might be modified to a certain extent by the systematic 
pruning of young trees. It is readily propagated by 
seeds. Its timber is light in weight and of no great 
value, but might be employed in the manufacture of 
packing cases. 

Ceylon appears to be the only country where it is 
planted as shade for cocoa. 

Pithecolobium Saman. This is planted as shade for 
cocoa in Trinidad, Venezuela, and to a small extent in 
the Gold Coast. Like Albizzia moluccana it requires 
constant attention in regard to pruning to prevent its 
forming too dense a shade. Such prunings, however, 
rapidly decompose and provide valuable dressings of 
humus. Being evergreen it is preferable to Erythrina for 
the reasons already described. The legumes of this 
tree are sometimes used as cattle food, but otherwise 
it yields no product of economic importance. The 
" Medera " (Gliricidia maculata) tree of Nicaragua is 
reported (Bulletin of Miscellaneous Information, Botanical 
Department, Trinidad, September 1903) to be used as 
shade for cocoa in that country ; it is raised from seeds 



32 SHADING AND INTER-CROPS FOR COCOA 

sown in lines 13 ft. apart. Aboutftwo years after the 
seeds have been sown the cocoa is planted in alternate 
lines, and the Medera provides the permanent shade. 

The San Thome planters utilise numerous indigenous 
trees as shade, these being left standing when the land is 
first cleared for planting. The commonest of these are 
the " Odum " timber tree (Chlorophora excelsa) ; West 
African Oil Palm (Elaeis Guineensis, Jacq.) ; Musanga 
Smithii ; West African Bread Fruit (Treculia ajricana) ; 
Cola-nut tree (Cola acuminata) ; the Silk-cotton tree 
(Eriodendronanfracl'iiosum). Where extra shade is neces- 
sary, various fruit trees are planted, such as Avocado pear 
(Persea gratissima) ; Mango (Mangifera indica) ; Jak fruit 
(Artocarpus integrifolia) ; Sour sop (Anona muricata) ; 
Bread Fruit (Artocarpus incisa). 

Various rubber trees are employed in some countries 
for shading cocoa. The Para rubber tree is probably 
the most suitable species to adopt where soil and climatic 
conditions are suitable. 

Temporary Shade for Young Cocoa Trees. Young cocoa 
trees are usually shaded by cultivating catch crops on 
the vacant land between the trees. The distance apart 
at which the cocoa tree is planted in different parts of 
the world varies from 6 to 25 ft., 15 ft. may, however, 
be considered a fair average distance. Planted at 15 ft. 
apart the trees will not meet for from ten to fifteen years. 
It is advisable to cultivate any vacant land between 
the trees during this period with catch crops, which, 
while affording the necessary shade, will protect the 
soil from adverse climatic conditions and yield a return 
to the planter until his cocoa comes into bearing. The 
plants most commonly used for this purpose are bananas 
or plantains (Musa spp.), cassava or manioc (Manihot 
ulilissima), coco or tania (Colocasia antiquorum) . 

Assuming that it be decided to plant cocoa at 15 ft. 
apart, and the permanent shade trees are 45 ft. apart, 
a banana should be planted in the centre of every four 
cocoa trees and a tania, cassava, or similar plant inter- 
mediate between the other trees. The diagram on page 33 
illustrates the position of the various plants at the end 
of the first year. 

When circumstances permit, it is advisable to plant 
the temporary shade trees two or three months before

the cocoa, so as to have shade ready for the newly trans- 
planted cocoa seedlings.

:it tlie end of first year. 

Bananas or Plantains, Musa spp. In countries where 
favourable facilities exist for marketing the fruit, the 
adoption of bananas for shading purposes proves a 
valuable adjunct to cocoa cultivation, as the profits 
obtained from the sale of the fruit can be made to cover 
the cost of up-keep until the cocoa comes into bearing. 
This plant is very hardy and grows rapidly from the 
suckers which are produced from the root-stocks of 
mature trees. 

In the East the word plantain is synonymous with 
banana, but it is here used in reference to the variety 
of Musa paradisiaca, which does not yield sweet fruits ; 
these are generally boiled or baked and eaten as a vege- 
table. 

Cassava or Manioc, Manihot utilissima. The well- 
known tapioca or manioc flour is obtained from the 
enlarged root of this plant, and its cultivation, as a catch 
crop with Hevea brasiliensis in Malaya, has been known 
to pay for the cost of up-keep during the first four years 
from the establishment of the plantation. It is readily

propagated by cutting up the stems in lengths of about 
a foot and fixing them firmly in the ground where they 
are intended to grow in the plantation. The roots are 
ready to harvest in from fifteen to eighteen months from 
the date the cuttings are planted. The roots form an 
important article of food for the labourers, and may be 
served out as rations either in the fresh state or in the 
form of flour made by grinding up the dried roots. 

Coco or Tania, Colocasia antiquorum. This plant is 
propagated by cutting up its tuberous roots so as to 
leave two or three buds or "eyes" on each section or 
" set." The " sets " are planted singly in the plantation 
about an inch below the surface ; the tuberous roots 
mature within about twelve months from the date the 
" sets " are planted. These, when cooked, are much 
relished as food by most estate labourers. 

It should, however, be mentioned that the cultivation 
of both cassava and tania is very exhausting to the soil, 
and when planted on poor land a good dressing of manure 
should be applied after the crop is reaped. 

Chillies, Capsicum annuum. This is a much less ex- 
hausting crop than cassava and tania and might be 
planted with advantage as a catch crop with cocoa. 

The tall growing varieties of " bird pepper " are pre- 
ferable, as they provide a better shade for young cocoa 
plants. 

Seedlings should be raised in prepared nursery beds ; 
when the young seedlings are 2 or 3 in. high, they may 
be transplanted into rows 3 ft. apart and about 2 ft. 
apart in the rows. Chillies should be harvested with 
the stalks attached and carefully dried in the sun ; it is 
necessary to remove the stalks previous to marketing 
the crop. Fifteen hundred pounds per acre is considered 
a fair crop, but as much as 2,500 Ib. per acre has 
been obtained. The price of Zanzibar chillies fluctuates 
between 15s. and 25s. per cwt. 

The species planted for temporary shade must be 
removed when they show signs of overcrowding the 
cocoa. It is best to reduce this shade gradually, or the 
cocoa may suffer by sudden exposure to the sun and 
wind. Wherever vacancies have occurred in the planta- 
tion the temporary shade should not be removed until 
the refills have become thoroughly established. 



CHAPTER VII 

PROPAGATION 

THE cocoa tree may be propagated from beans or by 
budding or grafting. The first mentioned method is 
the one most commonly employed. 

Bean Selection. The careful selection of the beans 
is of the highest importance, for upon this largely depends 
the quality and often the quantity of the resulting crop. 
It is of far more consequence than is the case with annual 
crops, where the sowing of seed of inferior varieties in 
any one season may be remedied the following season. 
With cocoa several years must elapse before the results 
are apparent. The cocoa planter should endeavour to 
produce a crop of even grade, and to enable this to be 
done it is necessary to obtain beans from similar trees. 
In selecting the species or variety to be cultivated 
he must be guided to a very large extent by the local 
conditions as regards soil and climate. 

The Criollo varieties of Theobroma cacao, and Theobroma 
pentagona are less hardy and require a richer soil than 
Theobroma sphcerocarpa and the Forastero types. The 
produce of the first two mentioned is of better quality and 
of higher market value than that of the last mentioned 
types. But as Theobroma sphcerocarpa and the Forastero 
varieties generally yield larger crops than the others 
it is probable that the gain in weight compensates for 
the lower price obtained. The Criollo varieties and 
Theobroma pentagona are more susceptible to disease, 
and will require much greater care and attention in dis- 
tricts where this is prevalent. As previously stated, 
the Forastero varieties and Theobroma sphcerocarpa 
produce flatter beans than those of the Criollo varieties 
and Theobroma pentagona, but some trees of the former 



36 PROPAGATION 

types yield much rounder beans than others, and these 
should preferably be chosen for propagating purposes. 

Round or " bold " beans almost invariably realise 
higher market prices than flat ones of the same quality. 
Certain trees are more disease-resistant than others. 
Beans from trees infected with disease should therefore 
not be used for propagating. Beans of diseased trees 
often contain a fungus mycelium, which might be the 
means of infecting young plants raised from them ; other 
qualities desirable in trees selected for propagating pur- 
poses are that they should be of high vitality and heavy, 
regular fruit bearers. 

Beans intended for sowing should only be selected from 
well-formed mature fruits and be taken from the centre 
of the fruit, where they are larger and better developed 
than those found at the ends of the fruit. 

Packing and Transport of Cocoa Beans. Cocoa beans 
which have been taken from out of the fruit and exposed 
to atmospheric influences soon lose their vitality. They 
may be preserved in the fruits for a week or two by 
completely covering them with a substance, such as 
paraffin wax, which hermetically seals the contents. 
Beans for propagation which are to be sent on a two or 
three weeks' journey may be satisfactorily treated as 
follows : 

Select perfectly ripe beans, thoroughly wash them and 
carefully wipe oft' as much of the adherent pulp as possible 
without injuring the integument. Spread them out 
thinly in a current of cool air for about twenty-four hours, 
then dust them with finely powdered charcoal. Prepare 
a mixture consisting of equal parts vegetable mould and 
finely powdered charcoal. Slightly moisten the mixture 
and place alternate layers of the mixture and beans in 
wooden boxes with a capacity of about a cubic foot. 
To prevent the fine portions of the mixture filtering 
through to one side of the box in transit, place sheets of 
stout paper or some similar material between each layer 
of beans. About 250 beans can be packed by this method 
in a box of the dimensions previously stated. 

When cocoa beans are to be sent on a journey of more 
than three weeks' duration they should be packed in 
Wardian cases. The bottom of the case should be covered 
to a depth of 3 or 4 in. with a slightly moistened mixture, 



PLANTS TRANSPORTED IN WARDIAN CASES 37 

consisting of three parts of leaf mould and one part of 
powdered charcoal. This should be firmly pressed down 
and the cocoa beans, prepared in a similar manner to that 
previously recommended, spread upon it close together 
in a single layer. Cover them an inch deep with the 
leaf mould and powdered charcoal mixture and press it 
firmly down. Upon the latter spread a thin layer of 
straw, fine twigs, or similar material and nail this tightly 
down with thin wooden battens an inch wide and about 
three-quarters of an inch distant from each other. To 
keep the straw or twigs in position it is necessary to fix 
the battens at right angles to the direction in which 
the former layer is placed. When the case has been 
properly closed it is ready for despatch. 

The beans will germinate in from ten to fifteen days. 
As provision is made in the Wardian case for the admission 
of both air and light the cocoa seedlings are enabled 
to develop unhindered, and upon arrival at their destina- 
tion should be at once transferred to pots or baskets 
and placed under nursery shelters. 

Nurseries. If it is not feasible to raise the young cocoa 
trees in the situations it is intended they shall occupy 
in the plantation they must first be raised in nurseries and 
transferred to the plantation when established. Sowing 
the beans in nursery beds is not recommended, as the 
young plants develop a substantial tap-root which is 
frequently injured when they are transplanted, and 
results in an unnecessarily high mortality in the plan- 
tation. The beans should therefore be sown in baskets 
or pots, from which they may be more readily trans- 
planted and with less damage to the roots. As it gener- 
ally takes from six to eight months to raise nursery plants 
large enough for transplanting in the field, to avoid loss 
of time it is necessary to regulate the date of sowing 
accordingly. 

The site for the nursery should be chosen in a well- 
sheltered situation adjacent to the plantation. For the 
protection of the young plants it is advisable to erect 
temporary nursery shelters, by fixing stout, upright 
posts about 8 ft. high, in lines 10 ft. apart each way, and 
then on these cross bars ; the whole being sufficiently 
strong to support a thin layer of palmleaves, split bamboos, 
or some similar material. It will be found that under 



38 PROPAGATION 

such a shelter the work of irrigating the young plants 
will be considerably lessened and the young seedlings 
will be protected from heavy rains and scorching sun. 

Most estate labourers are adept at making, from stout 
palm leaves, split bamboos, young pliable twigs, or 
strips cut from the outside layer of the petiole of palm 
leaves, baskets in which to raise young plants. Such 
baskets vary from 9 in. to a foot in height and in diameter 
from 4 to 6 in. 

Where suitable clay is available, plant pots may be 
moulded from it and kiln-dried to harden them. 

Sections of large, hollow bamboo poles also make ex- 
cellent pots in which to raise young plants. The poles 
are sawn up into sections about one foot long. The 
bottom of the pot is formed by sawing one end off about 
an inch below an internode or division of the pole, a hole 
being made in the bottom to permit water to drain 
away. 

Bean Sowing. A few rough stones should be placed 
at the bottom of the pot or basket to prevent fine soil 
filtering through and to facilitate drainage ; then fill to 
within 2 in. of the top with good, light, friable soil. It 
is advisable to dry or remove the white, mucilaginous pulp 
with which the beans are covered previous to sowing 
them. This may be done by spreading them out in the 
sun or by rubbing them with wood ashes. Provided 
that the vitality of the beans is satisfactory, one bean is 
sufficient to sow in each pot ; this should be placed on 
the soil in the pots prepared in the manner above de- 
scribed, and then covered with about half an inch of soil. 
Press the latter closely around the bean, thoroughly 
saturate the soil with water, and germination will take 
place in five or six days. In order to provide for failures 
in the plantation it is desirable to sow about 40 per cent, 
more beans than the number of trees which it is decided to 
establish in the plantation. 

The germinating properties of cocoa beans are generally 
excellent, and the proportion of beans which germinate 
often reaches as high as 98 per cent., but the mortality 
of young trees in the plantation is relatively great. The 
number of young plants which fail to grow may be 
estimated at 25, 10, 5, and 2 percent, of the total number 
of trees planted during the first, second, third, and fourth 



ADVANTAGES OF BUDDING 39 

years respectively from the establishment of the plan- 
tation. 

The young seedlings in the nursery require special care 
in regard to watering, as dryness at the roots is liable 
to check their development severely. In from six to eight 
months the young plants will have grown to about a foot 
high and may then be transferred to the plantation, 
provided the weather be suitable. 

Budding. Unless a cocoa flower is protected, cross- 
fertilisation may occur, and even if protected the 
characters of any particular variety of cocoa are not neces- 
sarily " fixed " in the plants raised from beans collected 
from it. The best and most certain means of perpetuat- 
ing the desirable characters of the parent tree in its 
progeny are by budding, grafting, or by propagating 
young growths. With this object in view the writer 
commenced in 1898 a series of experiments with cocoa 
trees growing in the Botanic Gardens at Aburi, in the 
Gold Coast. 

Only moderately satisfactory results were obtained by 
budding and the forms of grafting which necessitated 
the immediate removal of the scion from the parent tree. 
Attempts to propagate by cuttings furnished negative 
results, but grafting by approach proved most successful. 
Fawcett considers that the budding of cocoa is in 
every way more suitable than in-arching or grafting 
by approach. In Jamaica, Harris and Cradwick 
have both obtained excellent results by budding cocoa 
trees. 

Budding or grafting affords an admirable means of 
combining the commendatory qualities of the Criollo and 
T. pentagona varieties with the high vitality and prolific 
character of the Forastero types. 

It is almost invariably found that budding and grafting 
induce early bearing and a low spreading habit to the 
trees. The latter is a valuable attribute, for it facilitates 
the collection of the crop and renders shading and pro- 
tection from the wind less difficult. By Crad wick's 
demonstrations in Jamaica many small settlers, who 
previously were totally ignorant of the art of budding, 
have obtained uniformly successful results in budding 
Criollo on Forastero stocks. 

The budding and grafting of cocoa provide the planter 



40 PROPAGATION 

with a means of regulating the grade of his crop 
throughout the whole of his estate. 

Budding may be effectively carried out in both old and 
young plantations. In regard to the former, suckers 
from the old stocks should be operated upon and the old 
main stem removed when the buds have become thor- 
oughly established. Young plants may be budded 
previously to planting them out in the plantation, or 
young plants established in the plantation may be budded. 
If a strip of bark be cut from a cocoa tree and then care- 
fully replaced and bound up it will re-unite. In the 
same way, if a strip of bark be cut off one cocoa tree and 
a similar piece be cut from another and properly placed 
and bound up on the wound of the first tree, this will 
generally unite, and should it contain a healthy bud this 
will eventually develop into a branch and produce fruits 
similar to its parent. 

The success of the operation depends upon the junction 
of the cambium tissue of the stock with that of the bark 
containing the bud which it is desired to propagate. For 
this to be effected it is obviously necessary to bring these 
tissues in close proximity to each other. 

The cambium is the light-coloured, rapidly-growing 
tissue situated between the wood and the inner bark, and 
may be recognised when a cross-section is made of a young, 
woody stem. When bark is stripped off a stem a portion 
of the cambium tissue is usually taken away and the other 
remains adhering to the wood. The best time of the 
year to conduct budding operations is during the rainy 
season, when the sap is most active. The variety best 
adapted for the stock will of necessity vary in different 
countries, it is therefore advisable to choose for this 
purpose a locally cultivated variety which is hardy, 
prolific, and disease resistant ; these qualities are most 
commonly found in the Forastero varieties. Although 
the high quality of the beans produced by the Criollo and 
T. pentagona varieties commends them for this method 
of propagation, discrimination is necessary, as a particular 
variety will invariably be found to be less subject to 
disease and more prolific in a specific district than others. 
Whenever possible, select stocks for budding with a stem 
of a half to an inch in diameter. The bark containing the 
bud should be cut off about three inches long, about 



APPROACH-GRAFTING IN THE WEST INDIES 41 

three-quarters of an inch wide, and rectangular in shape. 
Place this upon the stock and mark the stock to enable 
a similar piece of bark to be cut out of it. 

The bud-bark should then be fixed in position and 
carefully bound up with waxed tape. 

Waxed tape can be made by dipping ordinary broad 
tape into melted paraffin wax. 

Provided that the work has been properly done junc- 
tion of the scion with the stock should be effected in 
from two to three weeks. When the bud has developed 
a growth about six inches long it is necessary to remove 
all growths of the stock above it. The scion may be 
expected to produce fruit when from one and a half to 
two years of age. 

Grafting. Excellent results have been obtained by 
approach-graftingimproved varieties of cocoa on Forastero 
stocks by Jones at the Botanic Gardens, Dominica (vide 
pamphlet, Series No. 6, issued by the Imperial Depart- 
ment of Agriculture for the West Indies). He obtained 
175 fruits from seven grafted trees, viz. Theobroma pen- 
tagona on Forastero stocks, within three years of 
planting the grafted plants ; and fourteen grafted trees, 
selected Forastero on Calabacillo stocks, yielded an 
average of eighteen fruits per tree within three years 
from date of planting. 

Successfully to carry out the operation of approach- 
grafting, or in-arching as it is sometimes termed, it is 
necessary to convey the stocks to the plant or plants 
which it is desirable to propagate or bring the latter in 
close proximity to the former. The first mentioned 
plan is the more practicable, since it is advisable, before 
deciding upon taking grafts from any particular tree, 
that it should have been under observation for several 
years and proved its prolificacy. 

The stocks on the other hand may be raised in baskets 
or pots, in the manner recommended under the heading 
" Nurseries." Seedling plants grown under these con- 
ditions will be large enough to use as stocks when they 
are eight or nine months old. The best time for grafting 
is during the rainy season, so the beans should be sown 
about eight months previously. 

As the cocoa tree carries its lateral branches several 
feet from the ground, it is necessary to support the pots 



42 PROPAGATION 

or baskets which contain the stocks on a stage or plat- 
form, so as to bring the branches to be used as scions 
and the stocks contiguous to each other. From the 
preceding remarks it will be seen that a low-branched 
"scion " tree is preferable, to facilitate both the grafting 
operations and any subsequent attention required by 
the grafted plants. As with budding, the object to 
aim at in grafting is to bring the cambium of the scion 
and that of the stock in conjunction. The scion should 
therefore have a stem diameter similar to the stock. 
Carefully slice away a strip of bark and wood about two 
or three inches long from one side of the stock ; this 
strip should not exceed a third of the thickness of the 
stem. Then carefully slice a similar strip from the 
growth selected as a scion, so that when the cut portions 
of the stock and scion are brought together the cambium 
tissues meet. Any leaves found on the section of the 
stock or the scion which has been sliced may be removed ; 
the two cut surfaces should then be bound carefully but 
firmly together with waxed-tape. The roots of the 
stocks must be kept constantly moist. During dry, 
windy weather the soil in the pots will evaporate rapidly, 
and it will be found necessary to water them at least 
once a day. 

If there be any danger of the pots being blown down 
by the wind they should be firmly fastened to the staging. 
To prevent undue movement of the grafts it may also 
be necessary to tie the branches supporting the scions to 
stout stakes fixed firmly in the ground. 

Union of the cambium tissues is usually apparent in 
five or six weeks. The scion should then be partially 
severed from its parent stem ; this is best done by 
cutting off a strip of bark about half way round the stem 
of the scion immediately below its junction with the 
stock. 

If on examining the scion a fortnight later it shows 
satisfactory progress it may be completely severed from 
the parent tree. The upper part of the stock should, 
at the same time, be carefully cut back to the point 
where it joins the scion. 

The grafted stock should now be placed in a shady 
position and well protected from both wind and sun. 
It sometimes happens that the leaves of the scion flag 



CARE OF GRAFTED PLANTS 43 

when it is first removed from the parent tree ; this is due 
to the fact that water is being more quickly transpired 
by the leaves than it can pass from the roots through 
the newly formed tissues . The check in growth associated 
with the flagging of the leaves may be remedied by placing 
the plants for a few days in a darkened place, which 
retards transpiration, or by cutting off some of the 
leaves and thus reducing the transpiring area. 

After about a month has elapsed since the severance 
of the scion from the parent tree, the new growth which 
has formed should be slowly accustomed to the hot sun 
by gradually diminishing the shade until it will stand 
unshaded without flagging ; the grafted plant is then 
ready for planting out in the open field. 

The forms of grafting which necessitate the removal 
of the scion from the parent tree, previous to its being 
bound to the stock, do not usually give such satisfactory 
results as the method of grafting by approach. Since 
these methods of grafting permit of scions being applied 
to stocks under nursery shelters, it follows that the 
grafts can be better protected from adverse climatic 
agencies, such as scorching sun and winds, than those 
in the open field. As in the approach method of grafting, 
it is advisable to raise stocks in pots or baskets. Until 
the operator has become expert it is not advisable for him 
to attempt the more complicated operations which 
"tongue" or "splice" grafting involves. 

What is known as " saddle " grafting is easily accom- 
plished. Having obtained a stock and scion whose 
stems are similar in diameter, slice off a thin strip of 
bark and wood from two opposite sides of the stem of 
the stock so as to leave a wedge-shaped strip of bark, 
about half an inch to three-quarters of an inch long ; 
trim all leaves off the scion and cut the base of the stem 
so that it will exactly fit over the wedge-shaped portion 
of the stock. As before, it is necessary to bring the 
cut cambium surface of the scion and stock in contact. 
Now bind the cut surfaces of the scion and stock firmly 
together with waxed tape and cover the latter with 
grafting wax to exclude air from the cut areas. 

Grafting wax may be manufactured by weighing four 
parts of resin, two parts of beeswax, and one part of tallow, 
placing them in a pot and melting them over a fire and 



44 PROPAGATION 

mixing them thoroughly together. The mixture is 
ready for use when cool. 

As soon as a complete junction between the scion and 
the stock has taken place the wax and tape may be re- 
moved. 

After the grafts have developed into good sturdy 
plants they should be hardened off by the removal of all 
shade preparatory to transplanting them in the open 
field. Whichever method of budding or grafting be 
adopted, it is important to prune away any growths which 
form below the bud or graft. 



CHAPTER VIII 

PLANTING, CULTIVATING, AND PRUNING 

Planting. The best time for planting cocoa is at the 
commencement of the rainy season, as this gives the 
young plants sufficient time to become thoroughly 
established, before the dry weather appears. Having 
partly accustomed the young nursery plants to the con- 
ditions which obtain in the open field, by removing all 
shade from them, transplanting may commence during a 
spell of wet or cloudy weather. The soil is first thoroughly 
saturated in the baskets or pots with water, to facilitate 
the subsequent removal of the plants. The roots should 
be disturbed as little as possible, and if the tap-root is 
broken or split it should be pruned back with a sharp 
knife above the injured area. The plants should not 
be buried too deeply in the ground ; it is quite sufficient 
if the surface-soil is on a level with the top of the ball 
of earth taken from the pot or basket. Should this ball 
be broken the roots in the ground should be buried so 
chat the surface-soil just reaches the point where the 
stem issues from the soil in the pot. These elementary 
matters are of primary importance, as large numbers of 
young cocoa plants fail to grow satisfactorily if they 
have been planted too deeply or too far out of the ground. 
The soil should be firmly pressed around the ball of earth 
enclosing the roots. It is almost impossible to carry 
out transplanting without slightly disturbing the roots. 
It is therefore advisable to protect the foliage from the 
hot sun ; leafy twigs, palm leaves, or bracken bent over 
in the form of a cage will provide the necessary shade 
until the young plants start into growth. If a spell of 
dry weather sets in before they become established in 

46 



46 PLANTING, CULTIVATING, AND PRUNING 

their new quarters it will be necessary to water them 
daily until rain falls. 

The mortality amongst newly planted cocoa is often 
very great, and sometimes as many as 30 per cent, of the 
plants perish during the first year following the establish- 
ment of the plantation. To obtain a uniform plantation 
it is essential to fill up these vacancies as rapidly as 
possible after they occur. 

Cultivating. We have already seen that the cocoa 
tree thrives in a moist soil rich in organic matter and 
that soils containing an abundance of humus are more 
retentive of soil-moisture than those in which it is lacking. 
The greatest percentage of organic matter is almost 
invariably found in the uppermost layers of a soil. Unless 
this surface-soil is protected it is liable to be washed 
away by heavy rains. There is, however, less likelihood of 
losses of this nature occurring on an estate where the 
soil is held together by a mass of fibrous roots. This 
state of affairs obtains in old cocoa plantations, and to 
a less extent in young cocoa plantations where all the 
vacant spaces between the trees are occupied by catch 
crops. 

Some planters affirm that the soil is best protected by 
allowing weeds to grow and by cutting them down at 
intervals. There is much to be said in favour of this 
practice, especially on hilly lands, for the surface-soil 
is prevented from being washed away by the network 
of fibrous roots formed by grasses and similar weeds. 
When they are cut down the plant-foods which they have 
extracted from the soil are in a measure returned as soon 
as decomposition sets in. The biological condition of the 
soil is likewise improved by the protection afforded by 
the weeds, as soil-bacteria, which act upon the nitrogenous 
compounds of organic matter in the soil and convert 
them into soluble plant-food, cannot thrive unless 
protected from strong, direct sunlight. 

Maimrial Value of Weeds. According to the West 
Indian Bulletin, the weeds normally growing on 225 sq. ft. 
of land, under a young cocoa plantation, in Dominica, 
were collected and weighed ; then allowed to dry and 
weighed again, when it was found that they had lost 
33" 6 per cent, of their original weight. An analysis of 
the air-dried material gave the following results :

potash, and phosphoric acid as there are in about 334 Ib. 
of sulphate of ammonia, 171 Ib. of sulphate of potash, 
and 1 cwt. of basic slag respectively. 

The disadvantages associated with allowing weeds to 
grow in young cocoa plantations may now be considered. 
Unless the weeds are constantly cleared away from the 
cocoa trees they will interfere with and check the 
development of the young lateral roots of the cocoa 
trees and rob them of a certain amount of available 
plant-food. Shade trees and plants used as temporary 
shading agents will be similarly affected. 

Many noxious perennial weeds found on cocoa plan- 
tations are exceedingly difficult to eradicate if allowed 
to grow unchecked, and rapidly spread in all directions. 
The most pernicious are those which develop tuberous 
or stoloniferous roots. Such plants cannot be destroyed 
by cutting down the foliage-bearing portions. A striking 
example of this category is the common nut-grass, 
Cyperus bulbosus (rotundus). It is useless to cut down 
this plant before it seeds to check its spreading, as its 
roots frequently descend 3 cr 4 ft. below the surface of 
the ground and bear numerous "nuts" or bulbs, any 
one of which is capable of producing a new plant. This 
plant also develops lateral, nut-bearing roots which 
frequently extend a foot or more from the parent plant. 
A dense growth of this Cyperus, in the neighbourhood 
of the roots of a cocoa tree, would be exceedingly difficult 
to eradicate without seriously damaging the cocoa roots. 
It would be almost impossible to extract all the Cyperus 
bulbs from the ground at one time. By the time the 
bulbs which had been left in the ground had produced 
foliage their roots would have again become entangled 



48 PLANTING, CULTIVATING, AND PRUNING 

with those of the cocoa tree, and the latter would be 
redisturbed when the Cyperus roots were extracted. 

Cyperus bulbosus (rotundus) is a serious pest in Gold 
Coast cocoa plantations, and the writer has seen it grow- 
ing profusely in cocoa plantations in San Thome. 

Several other weeds found in cocoa plantations develop 
long, underground, jointed stems, capable of producing 
new plants from the buds formed at each joint. If the 
foliage of the parent plant is cut down, encouragement 
is given to these buds to form new plants, which rapidly 
take possession of the ground. When colonies of such 
weeds occur in the neighbourhood of a cocoa tree there 
is a struggle between its roots and the roots of the weeds. 
The tender roots of the cocoa tree are rapidly smothered 
and its growth is severely checked. Fortunately it is 
possible to cover the vacant ground between cocoa trees 
with leguminous plants, the growth of which can be so 
controlled that they do not interfere with the develop- 
ment of either the permanent or the catch crops. 

Leguminous Cover-Plants. When the commonest weeds 
found on cocoa plantations are cut down they only return 
to the soil the plant-foods which they have extracted 
from it. Leguminous plants, when cut down, return to 
the soil not only the plant-foods they have taken up 
from it but, in addition, the atmospheric nitrogen which 
they are able to fix. It will therefore be apparent 
that a green covering of leguminous weeds is likely to 
prove more beneficial than a covering of ordinary weeds. 
The arborescent types of Leguminosce are not recom- 
mended for this purpose. When frequently pruned they 
develop large root-stocks ; these are difficult to eradicate 
without damaging the roots of the cocoa trees, when the 
time arrives to remove them in order to provide addi- 
tional space for the latter. Various herbaceous Legu- 
minosce, such as Crotalarias, Cassias, and Cajanus, are 
much better adapted for ground-covering purposes. All 
of these are, however, more difficult to eradicate than 
the prostrate and creeping leguminous types, such as the 
Vignas, Phaseolus, Arachis, and Mucunas. The latter 
may be rooted up by hand whenever they show signs 
of encroaching upon the cocoa trees. 

The treatment of leguminous cover-plants and catch 
crops will be more fully dealt with in a subsequent chapter 



THE OBJECTS OF PRUNING 49 

on manuring. Where leguminous cover-plants are grown 
weeds must be kept in check ; those cut down should be 
spread beneath the cocoa trees to serve as a mulch, and 
when they decay valuable organic plant-foods will be 
added to the soil. 

The ground should not be allowed to become caked 
on the surface. A loose soil absorbs more water than a 
compact soil, and surplus water drains away far more 
rapidly from the former than from the latter. Loose 
soil is far better aerated than compact soil. Air is not 
only essential for the proper development of the roots 
of plants, but also for that of the nitrifying bacteria, 
which are generally most abundant in the first 6 in. of 
surface-soil. Forking should therefore be practised 
wherever there is no danger of injury to the tender 
rootlets of the cocoa tree, but a network of these is 
frequently found quite near the surface, and it is only 
possible to adopt an exceedingly superficial system of 
forking to avoid damage in these areas. 

Pruning. The main objects of pruning are : the pro- 
duction of symmetrical trees, with a maximum quantity 
of fruiting branches ; to facilitate the admission of air and 
light to all parts of the tree ; to encourage a spreading 
habit, which enables the fruit to be more easily harvested ; 
and to remove gormandising suckers which rise from 
the main stem. Cultivated cocoa trees usually com- 
mence to branch when about 3 ft. high. In the case of 
trees which produce branches when lower than this, 
it is usual to prune off all but one of these secondary 
branches. The advantage of this practice is open to 
doubt, and there seems to be no reasonable explanation 
why a tree, branching at a foot from the ground, should 
not give as good results as one which branches at three or 
more feet from the ground. 

The primary branches are generally restricted to 
three, but there appears to be no reason why, when four 
or even five appear, they should not be allowed to remain. 
The primary branches are the principal fruiting branches, 
so that if thinning be necessary this can be sufficiently 
practised on the secondary or tertiary branches. 

It is obvious that a tree branching near the ground 
is most likely to develop a low spreading habit, and 
fruits are more readily gathered from such types. When 
4 



50 PLANTING, CULTIVATING, AND PRUNING 

young trees show no signs of branching when they are 
4 ft. high the terminal bud should be removed; this 
induces the buds in the axils of the leaves to develop into 
lateral branches. Young trees which are too densely 
shaded often grow 5 or 6 ft. high before commencing 
to branch. 

Light pruning at frequent intervals is far better than 
the destruction of large branches which later pruning 
involves. 

The growth of the parts of the tree above ground is 
in direct ratio to that of those below the ground. It 
consequently follows that when the branches of a tree 
are severely pruned the growth of the roots is likewise 
arrested. The leaves may be regarded as the laboratory 
where plants elaborate sap which is subsequently em- 
ployed in building up new tissues for the roots, stem, and 
branches, and a reduction of the foliage-area of a tree 
must of necessity restrict this operation. 

On many cocoa estates, where trees have been too 
closely planted together, the young branches are 
frequently pruned back with a view to limiting the 
foliage-area of each tree to the space allotted to it in 
the plantation. This system of pruning may yield 
satisfactory results for a short time, but it is biologic- 
ally unsound, as the constant restriction of the tree's 
development must in time reduce its cropping capacity. 

Pruning operations should not be conducted with a 
view to restricting the foliage-area of a given tree, but to 
facilitate the development of the fruit -producing parts of 
the tree and improving the conditions for fruitproduction 
in their neighbourhood. It would be far better policy 
to prune back alternate trees, thus allowing the others 
to spread naturally, and subsequently eradicate the trees 
which were pruned back when the unpruned trees had 
grown sufficiently large to cover the ground occupied 
by them. Pruning operations are of most importance 
during the first eight or nine years of the tree's life. 
They should be conducted with a view to obtaining well- 
balanced trees. Any growths which tend to cross others 
should be removed. If the branches are too thick to 
allow of air and light penetrating to the trunk and main 
branches, where the greatest number of flowers and 
fruits are produced, the more weakly ones should be 



DISBUDDING TO INCREASE BRANCH FORMATION 51 

removed. Shoots growing in an upward or outward 
direction from the centre of the tree should be retained 
in preference to those which grow with a tendency in 
a contrary direction. It is impossible to state definitely 
how many branches should be pruned or how many 
should be left. The art of pruning must be learnt by 
experience, but it is a good rule not to cut out a healthy 
branch. The same branch can be pruned off later if 
necessary, but it cannot be replaced when cut off. 

Where a paucity of branches occurs the branch system 
may be increased by pinching out the terminal buds of 
the principal branches. 

Trees are often robbed of valuable branches when this 
could be avoided by a little forethought. It frequently 
happens that a branch hanging across another may be 
saved from the pruning-knife by propping it up with a 
stout stake. 

Before cutting off a branch which bends downward 
and drags on the ground an endeavour should be made 
to put it into place by means of a stout prop. 

In an estate where pruning has been neglected all 
undesirable branches should not be thinned out at one 
operation, or the growth of the trees will be severely 
checked for the reasons already explained. A properly 
executed, annual pruning is sufficient. The best season 
to prune is when the sap is least active, and this fre- 
quently coincides with the end of the principal crop 
season. Most cocoa trees carry more or less fruit all 
through the year, but they invariably produce more 
fruit during a particular period usually towards the 
end of the rainy season. The removal of large branches 
is very rarely necessary from cocoa trees which have 
been always properly pruned ; indeed, the best pruned 
trees are those from which all undesirable growths have 
been removed with a pocket pruning-knife. In the case 
of old trees which have been neglected in the matter of 
pruning a large and a small saw r and pruning shears must 
be brought into requisition. These are also necessary 
for the removal of dead branches. 

In cutting out large branches the weight of the foliage 
often causes the branch to split near where the incision 
is being made, resulting in an ugly, splintered wound. 



52 PLANTING, CULTIVATING, AND PRUNING 

This generally may be avoided by first making a cut on 
the underside of the branch and then completing the 
severance immediately above this cut. 

It is necessary to keep all implements used for pruning 
operations properly sharpened, and with a view to en- 
couraging pruners to maintain their instruments in good 
working order, each should be provided with, and carry 
with him, the necessary articles for sharpening his tools. 

Cuts should be made in a slanting direction and close 
to the stems from which the condemned growth issues. 

When this is not practised the short butts often decay 
and offer a convenient ingress to the trees of parasitic 
fungi and various insect pests. Wounds made in the 
removal of young growths with a sharp pruning-knife 
rapidly form a callus and do not need to be antisepticised 
as a protection against disease. Those made by the 
removal of larger branches should be first pruned smooth 
with a sharp pruning-knife and then painted with an 
antiseptic. Where branches have been broken off by 
the wind or other agencies the splintered end should 
be treated in a similar manner. Four parts of resin oil 
mixed with one part of tar forms an excellent antiseptic 
dressing for wounds. The application of undiluted tar 
to wounds is riot recommended, as it is liable to burn the 
green bark at the edge of the wound. 

One of the strong, gormandising suckers, which fre- 
quently spring from the base of the trunk of the cocoa 
tree, may be left growing with advantage on a tree in 
a poor state of health, with a view to cutting down the 
old stem to the point where the gormandiser issues and 
of allowing the latter to take its place. The writer has 
observed excellent fruiting trees obtained from gorman- 
disers both in Ceylon, West Africa, and San Thome. When 
the canker disease was rampant in Ceylon cocoa plan- 
tations, numerous affected trees were cut down and 
gormandisers were encouraged to develop in their stead. 
The same method is adopted in San Thome with 
trees which are seriously attacked by termites. 

All young growth pruned off should be buried, to 
increase the organic matter in the soil, and thick branches 
should be burned to prevent their affording a medium 
for the propagation of diseases. 



CHAPTER IX 

MANURING 

THE word manure formerly only applied to animal 
excreta, but it has to-day a far wider meaning, for any 
substance added to the soil to increase its fertility is 
considered as manure. 

It may be applied either with a view to increasing 
the productiveness of soils or to renovate and restore 
the fertility of soils worn out by repeated cropping. We 
know that plants derive their nourishment from the soil 
and the atmosphere, and also the particular nutritive 
elements which are respectively furnished by these two 
sources. Provided that the cocoa planter establishes his 
plantation on land adapted to the cultivation of cocoa, 
it may be premised that if he annually returns to the 
land manure containing equal quantities of the elements 
which are removed by his crop, his debit and credit 
account in regard to the soil should balance. 

This reasoning is sound from a purely theoretical point 
of view, but unfortunately it is not applicable in practice. 
For the planter has no means of ascertaining the amount 
of plant-foods lost by drainage nor the changes brought 
about in the soil by climatic and bacterial agencies. 

Reasons for Manuring. Experiments conducted at 
Rothamsted have shown that 7' 21 Ib. of nitrogen per 
acre were deposited by rain, snow, and dew from the 
atmosphere, but the loss of nitrogen by drainage, in the 
form of nitric acid, was much greater than that deposited 
from the atmosphere. Further, irrespective of the 
excellent results obtained by nitrogenous manuring, 
when ammonia salts were applied to wheat in the autumn 
two-thirds of the nitrogen supplied was unrecovered 
in the increase of the crops. From the application of 
nitrate of soda in the spring more than one half of the 

53 



54 MANURING 

quantity supplied was unrecovered. By far the greater 
proportion of the unrecovered nitrogen was lost in the 
drainage water. This indicates that much more nitro- 
genous manures must be added than are actually required 
by the crop. 

Plants take up from the soil : nitrogen, phosphoric acid, 
potash, lime, magnesia, soda, oxide of iron, sulphuric 
acid, chlorine, and silica. Many virgin, tropical soils 
contain these constituents in adequate quantity and 
in a sufficiently available condition for the remunerative 
cultivation of cocoa ; in others there is a deficiency of 
one or more of these elements ; so that after a few years' 
cropping the soil becomes impoverished and consequently 
remains unproductive until the missing elements are 
restored. 

The value of the soil, therefore, may be estimated by the 
amount it contains of the ingredient or ingredients which 
are most lacking in an available condition. A chemical 
analysis of the soil may demonstrate that all the food 
elements necessary for plant nutrition are present, but 
unless they are in such a form as to be soluble in the 
sap of the root-cells they are of no immediate value to 
the plant. 

The Economical Application of Manures. The chemical 
analysis of the soil and of the crop to be cultivated 
undoubtedly furnishes useful hints in regard to the soil's 
manurial requirements, but there are other important 
factors to be taken into consideration, such as the physical 
and hygienic condition of the soil. 

Not until the cocoa planter has satisfied himself that 
his soil is satisfactory in these latter respects should he 
attempt to deal with the manurial problem. 

The economical application of manures is dependent 
upon a due consideration of the requirements of the 
cocoa trees, the composition of the soil, the physical 
condition of the soil, and the composition of the manures 
applied. 

The plant-food ingredients in which soils are most 
generally lacking are : nitrogen, phosphoric acid, potash, 
and less frequently lime. 

Chemical analyses of different parts of the cocoa tree 
have already been given (chapter iv.). The ingredients 
used up in the formation of the leaves are in a great 



CONSTITUENTS OF COCOA TREES 



55 



measure returned to the soil by the annual leaf-fall ; if 
the shells of cocoa fruits be also returned, the ingredients 
actually taken from the soil are those used up in the 
formation of roots, branches, and the beans. 

Harrison estimated that the annual production of 
leaves, young shoots and fruits per acre on a cocoa 
estate demands from the soil, amongst other ingredients, 
138 Ib. nitrogen, 104 Ib. lime, 94 Ib. potash, 64 Ib. 
phosphoric acid, and 31 Ib. magnesia. This estimate 
includes leaves and fruit shells which are on most estates 
re-incorporated in the soil. 

Cockrane estimated that in Ceylon, an acre of cocoa 
trees, planted at the rate of 302 trees to the acre, and 
yielding 1 Ib. of cured cocoa per tree per annum, would 
require for the annual incremental growth of the trees 
and the bean crop : 63' 4 Ib. lime, 59' 3 Ib. potash, 
31' 5 Ib. nitrogen, 19 Ib. magnesia, and IT 7 Ib. phos- 
phoric acid. 

On the basis of an annual average yield of 250 Ib. and 
150 Ib. of cured cocoa per acre from Calabacillo and 
Forastero varieties respectively, the under-mentioned 
quantities of plant constituents are annually removed 
from the soil by the beans in British Guiana (Proceedings 
of the Agricultural Society British Guiana).

Manurial Experiments. In order to ascertain the 
plant constituents which the soil lacks, a different manure 
should be applied to various parts of the plantation and 
the effects watched. By this means the expense will be 
saved of purchasing manures containing constituents 
which are already abundant. For a fair comparison to 
be drawn from the results obtained it is most essential 
that the plots selected for experiment should be as like 
as possible in every factor which would affect the experi- 



56 MANURING 

ment. The land should bo flat and the soil similar in 
each experimental plot. The plots should have been 
similarly treated in regard to previous cultivation and 
manuring. 

The cocoa trees should be of the same variety in each 
plot, of like age, and be planted at a uniform distance 
apart. It is also of importance that the same system 
of pruning should have been applied to the trees in each 
plot. The plots should be uniform in area and each 
should contain the same number of trees. Nitrogen, 
phosphoric acid, and potash are the constituents in which 
the soil is most likely to be lacking. It may be deficient 
in one or even two, but most unlikely in all of these 
ingredients. To test for one constituent four plots will 
be necessary, including the control plot. The results 
in this case would not, however, be satisfactory if more 
than one constituent were lacking in the soil. It is 
therefore advisable to have eight experimental plots. 
Each should be at least one-fifth of an acre in area. 
Strips of land 88 yds. long by 11 yds. wide would be 
suitable, and, if the trees were planted at 15 ft. apart, 
each plot would contain 34 trees. At least two rows of 
trees should be left unmanured between each plot. In 
the subjoined table are given the weights of the various 
manures which it is suggested should be applied to each 
plot.

broad-cast as evenly as possible and then lightly forked 
in ; and as all the manures recommended for the experi- 
ment are of a more or less soluble nature they should be 
applied towards the end of the rainy season. If applied 
earlier there would be danger of a great part of the 
fertilising constituents being washed away by the constant 
heavy rains. It is necessary to apply the fertilisers 
annually for at least three consecutive years. During 
this period each of the plots must be treated similarly 
in regard to pruning and cultivation. At the end of 
three years, if careful records have been kept of the 
condition of the trees and the crops yielded by each 
plot, the planter ought to be in a position to decide 
whether his soil is poor in one or more plant-food con- 
stituents, and which they are. 

Animal Manures. Although artificial manures have the 
advantage over animal and vegetable manures in supply- 
ing in a compact form the requisite nitrogen, potash, 
and phosphoric acid, they have not the same beneficial 
effect on the physical condition of the soil. The natural 
manures are relatively poor in plant-food, as compared 
with chemical manures, and their application entails 
a far greater expenditure on transport and labour. 
Nitrogen is invariably present in them in far greater 
relative quantities than potash and phosphoric acid. 
The nitrogen encourages the growth of leaves and stems, 
but the potash and phosphoric acid are more helpful 
in promoting fruit production. Where the latter are 
deficient in cocoa soils it is advisable to apply them in 
conjunction with animal manures. 

Animal manures are especially valuable in cocoa 
plantations on account of the beneficial effects they 
have upon the texture of the soil. It has already been 
pointed out that the lateral roots of the cocoa tree 
rapidly take possession of the surface-soil, thus 
rendering proper tillage impracticable without injuring 
them. The organic matter which animal manures 
supply imparts to the soil that sponginess so im- 
portant in a cocoa plantation for the retention of soil 
moisture. 

Animal manures also improve the sanitary condition 
of the soil by facilitating drainage and aeration, thus 
improving the conditions for the development of nitri- 



58 MANURING 

fying bacteria, and in addition aid in rendering mineral 
elements already in the soil available for plant-food. 
They encourage earth-worms, which bring up to the 
surface a certain amount of sub-soil. This becomes 
weathered and converted into a state more suitable for 
plant nourishment. 

It is unfortunately comparatively rare to find a suffi- 
cient number of cattle maintained on a cocoa plantation 
to supply an adequate quantity of manure for the whole 
estate. It appears to the writer that considerable 
advantage would be gained by increasing the number of 
live stock on many cocoa estates, even if this necessitated 
the allocation of a portion of the estate to the cultivation 
of food crops for them. 

The importance attaching to the conservation of the 
fertilising elements of cattle manure is often not suffi- 
ciently appreciated. When exposed to atmospheric 
influences valuable manurial elements are washed out 
by heavy rains. The heating or fermentation caused 
by the growth of bacteria rapidly converts its nitrogen 
into ammonia, which escapes into the atmosphere unless 
the manure be properly covered. If when cleaning out 
the stock-yard it is not convenient to apply the manure 
direct to the plantation, it should be stored under cover 
a thatched roof is well adapted for this purpose and 
soil should be thrown over the manure heap. Experi- 
ments have shown that two-thirds of the fertilising 
properties of farm-yard manure are lost by twelve months' 
exposure to the atmosphere, including nearly all the 
soluble nitrogen and 78 per cent, of the soluble mineral 
ingredients. 

The liquid excrements of animals, being rich in potash 
salts, etc., are of considerable value for fertilising purposes, 
and provision should be made to prevent their leaching 
away from the stock-yard. Drains can be made at 
comparatively little cost leading from the stock-yard to 
the manure heap, over which the liquid should be 
thrown. 

To this heap should also be added all decompos- 
able refuse from the estate kitchens and labourers' 
quarters. 

The following table shows the relative value of 
various natural manures for fertilising purposes :

The amount of animal manure to apply must depend 
upon the quality of the manure and the condition of 
the soil, but 1J tons per acre may be considered a fair 
average application. When sufficient animal manure 



60 MANURING 

is not available to provide a dressing for the whole 
plantation, it would be advisable to treat different por- 
tions in rotation. Animal manure, being less readily 
soluble than many chemical manures, may be applied 
at the commencement of the rainy season. 

Whenever the root-system of the cocoa trees permits 
of it, manure should be lightly forked in. It is 
advisable for drain and road cleaning to be co- 
incident with the application of manure, so that the 
debris taken from these places could be spread over 
the manured area to assist in checking the escape of 
ammonia. 

Artificial Manures. Many fertilisers, such as guano 
and nitrate of soda, are, strictly speaking, natural manures, 
but it is usual to consider all manures not produced on 
the farm as artificial manures. The latter may be 
divided into four main divisions, i.e. nitrogenous, phos- 
phatic, potassic, and special or compound manures. The 
basis of the last mentioned is usually super-phosphate, 
which is mixed with various other manurial ingredients 
to meet the specific demands of particular crops and 
soils. It is found more economical to mix dry, fine 
earth with artificial manures previous to broad-casting 
them in the plantation, and to fork them into the 
ground as much as possible without disturbing the 
roots. The principal nitrogenous artificial manures 
are : ammonium salts, guano nitrate of soda, dried blood, 
and oil cake. 

Vegetable Manures. The texture of soils deficient in 
organic matter may be considerably improved by 
the incorporation of vegetable matter. It is also found 
that artificial manures give far better results when 
a wornout soil's condition has been improved by this 
means. 

Experiments conducted at the Minnesota Agricultural 
Experiment Station have shown that by increasing 
the organic matter in th:, soil 0'5 per cent, the amount 
of nitrogen was raised by 245 Ib. per acre. Vegetable 
matter is beneficial to both heavy and light soils ; in the 
case of the former it separates the soil particles and 
renders the soil more permeable to air and moisture ; 
in the latter case the moisture-holding capacity of the 
soil is increased. 



VALUE OP LEGUMINOUS COVER PLANTS 61 

The most practical means of vegetable manuring is 
by cultivating various quick-growing plants and burying 
them in the ground. When they decay acids are formed 
which aid in the dissolution of some of the unavailable 
plant-foods in the soil. Leguminous plants are most 
largely used for this purpose in view of the property 
which many of them possess of absorbing free nitrogen 
from the atmosphere. The creeping, or low-growing 
forms of Leguminosce are preferable to the shrubs and 
tree forms, as the latter are often difficult to eradicate 
without injuring the roots of the cocoa tree. Some of the 
former varieties yield commercial products, such as the 
ground-nut (Arachis hypogea) and the cow-pea (Vigna 
catiang). When these are grown with the intention of 
obtaining a crop before turning the plants into the soil, 
their value as manurial agents is obviously depreciated. 
In order to obtain seeds for future sowing it is advisable 
to allow a certain number of the plants to produce seeds 
before digging them in. 

The cultivation and burying of leguminous plants 
cannot be expected to renovate completely exhausted 
soils, as although these plants contribute more nitrogen 
than they extract they only return the phosphoric acid 
and potash which they obtained from the soil. 

In young cocoa plantations it is possible to bury the 
plants grown for green manuring. A circular trench 
should be dug around each tree, but sufficiently distant 
from its roots to avoid injuring them. In this the 
green plants should be placed, sprinkled with air- 
slaked lime, gypsum, or wood ashes, and covered up 
with soil. 

Lime assists the decomposition of the green material 
and thus renders its constituents more quickly available as 
food. Wood ashes are rich in lime, and frequently con- 
tain from 6 to 9 per cent, of potash and about 2 per cent, 
of phosphoric acid. Under old cocoa trees which densely 
shade the ground green-manuring plants cannot be 
profitably grown, but it is generally found that they will 
thrive between the trees, provided that the latter have 
not been too closely planted together. The advantages 
accruing from protecting the soil in cocoa plantations 
with a cover of leguminous plants has already been 
dealt with. 



62 MANURING 

In old cocoa plantations it is generally found that 
the roots have taken possession of the soil to such a 
degree that it is impossible to bury the plants grown 
for green-manuring without injuring the roots of the 
cocoa trees. In such cases it would be advisable to pile 
the plants in heaps until they decayed, and then to apply 
the decomposed matter as a top dressing. 

With regard to the cultivation of leguminous plants 
with the primary object of increasing the quantity of 
nitrogen in the soil, it is well to point out that plants, 
growing in a soil which does not contain nitrogen-fixing 
bacteria, are not enriched by atmospheric nitrogen. 
There are numerous kinds of these bacteria, and it does 
not necessarily follow because, say, cow-peas produced 
abundant nitrogenous nodules on their roots in a par- 
ticular soil, that an Albizzia would be equally effective 
in this respect. This particular soil, however, could 
be inoculated with the form of bacteria associated with, 
say, the Albizzia root nodules by broad-casting soil 
brought from land in which Albizzias produced numerous 
nitrogenous nodules on their roots. 

It sometimes happens that where a particular species 
of Leguminosce has not been previously cultivated com- 
paratively few nodules are found on its roots the first 
time it is cultivated, but the next time it is planted it 
is generally found that the nodules will be produced in 
much greater abundance, provided that the hygienic 
condition of the soil is satisfactory. 

In 1900 the writer introduced the American cow-pea 
as a green-cover crop in the cocoa plantation at the 
Botanic Gardens, Gold Coast. When it was first sown 
comparatively few nitrogenous nodules were produced 
on the roots of the plants, but succeeding sowings gave 
excellent results. After the cow-pea had been planted 
for two or three years, by which time it had become 
thoroughly acclimatised, it was found possible to grow 
it all through the year, and from three to four crops 
were annually turned into the ground. Trenches were 
dug between the rows of trees, and the cow-pea plants 
were buried in these after being sprinkled with lime 
or wood-ashes. Pithecolobium trees were planted as 
shade for the cocoa trees, and the prunings from these 
were also buried in the trenches. 



SOIL IMPROVED BY GREEN-MANURING 63 

The natural soil in these gardens is distinctly poor in 
quality and much inferior to that found in the principal 
cocoa-growing districts of the Gold Coast. There is very 
little doubt that the frequent application of vegetable 
matter has materially ameliorated the soil conditions 
in the cocoa plantation, owing to the fact that the foliage 
contains a high percentage of valuable manurial matters, 
i.e. 0*27 per cent, nitrogen, O'lO per cent, phosphoric 
acid, and 0'31 per cent, potassium oxide. In 1904, when 
the cocoa trees were thirteen years of age, they yielded 
at the rate of 7 cwt. of cured cocoa per acre. 

In the report of the Gold Coast Agricultural Depart- 
ment for 1908, it is stated with reference to these trees 
" from a small area of If acres and from 259 trees planted 
at 15 x 15 ft., a yield of 18,200 pods, equivalent to 15 cwt. 
of cured cocoa, was produced between October 23 and 
December 31 of this year. ... A considerable crop was 
also taken in the earlier part of this year of which 
no record was kept ; and the trees are now giving promise 
of an early crop in 1909." Mr. Evans, the Travelling 
Instructor, Gold Coast, has recently informed the writer 
that one block of these trees yielded, in 1909, at the rate 
of 11 Ib. per tree, and two other blocks yielded at the 
rate of 6 and 8 Ib. per tree respectively. The weight 
of organic matter added to the soil by various legu- 
minous plants is exemplified by the under-mentioned 
results of green-manuring experiments conducted by the 
Botanic Department, Antigua :

The velvet bean (Mucuna utilis] is also well adapted 
for cultivating as a green-cover crop in cocoa plantations. 
Experiments conducted by the Barbados Botanic Depart- 
ment show that in from two to three months a crop of 
vines was produced equal to 12,343 Ib. per acre. 

The 1908-9 Report from the Grenada Botanical 
Department states : "The subject of mulching cocoa has 
attracted considerable attention during the year, and 
with the object of growing suitable material for a mulch, 
experiments were conducted with cow-peas in conjunc- 
tion with bacterial inoculation. No conclusive results 
were obtained, but the advantage of growing a legu- 
minous crop in the open spaces among cocoa instead of 
weeds, and bedding this in to supply humus, while the 
root nodules add nitrogen to the soil, is becoming uni- 
versally recognised." 

Lime. For the production of good crops it is essential 
that lime should be present in the soil. Applications 
of animal manure, guano, and similar manures are of 
little avail if the soil is deficient in lime. One of the main 
functions of lime is to combine with the acids of the 
potash and the ammoniacal salts of guano and of farm- 
yard and similar manures, and to liberate potash and 
ammonia. The latter are retained in the soil, but the 
less expensive lime salts largely run away in the drainage 
water. In addition to supplying a necessary plant 
constituent, lime prevents the loss by drainage of the 



LIME CORRECTS SOIL ACIDITY 66 

three principal fertilising matters, phosphoric acid, 
potash, and ammonia. Lime actually adds none of these 
three elements to the soil, so that its repeated application 
tends to impoverish the soil. Lime should never be mixed 
with or applied at the same time as manure containing 
a salt of ammonia, as it acts at once on the salt and 
liberates the ammonia too quickly. 

Applications of lime are particularly beneficial for 
neutralising the acidity present in sour soils, and for 
this purpose it should be broad-casted as powdered 
slaked-lime, at the rate of 2,000 Ib. per acre. Sea sand, 
rich in shells, often contains as much as 30 per cent, of 
lime ; wood ashes contain from 30 to 35 per cent, of 
lime, and either of these materials could be advantage- 
ously substituted for lime where the latter is expensive. 
The lime in these materials is, however, not free, but 
exists as carbonate, which is usually as effective as 
lime itself. 



CHAPTER X 

RESULTS OP MANURIAL EXPERIMENTS IN VARIOUS 
COUNTRIES 

CONSIDERABLE research has been undertaken during 
recent years by the various Botanical and Agricultural 
establishments in several cocoa-growing countries with 
the view to ascertaining the kind of manure best adapted 
for fertilising cocoa in particular districts. The Imperial 
Department of Agriculture for the West Indies has been 
particularly energetic in this respect, and the following 
details in regard to the cocoa-manuring experiments 
conducted in the various West Indian islands have been 
extracted, for the most part, from the publications of 
this Department. 

DOMINICA 

The table on page 67 shows the excellent results which 
have attended the cocoa-manuring experiments con- 
ducted at the Botanic Station, Dominica. The experi- 
ments were initiated in the year 1900, but results were not 
recorded until 1902-3. Five plots were selected for the 
experiments, comprising a total area of 1^ acres containing 
cocoa trees ten years of age. 

The manures and the mulch were applied once a year ; 

the former were distributed and slightly stirred into the 

soil and the latter was simply spread over the ground. 

The weights of manure applied per acre were as follows : 

Plot. 

No. 2. 4 cwt. basic phosphate and 1 cwt. sulphate of 

potash. 

,, 3. 4 cwt. dried blood. 

,, 4. 4 cwt. dried blood, 4 cwt. basic phosphate, and 
li cwt. sulphate of potash. 
66 



67 

The mulch consisted of grass and leaves, and the 
leaves and fruits of the Samaan, Rain or Guango tree 
(Pithecolobium Saman), and was applied at the rate of 
80 Ib. per tree. 



YIELD OF CURED COCOA IN LB. PER ACRE PROM 1902 

TO 1908 

The weight of cured cocoa was arrived at by estimating 
it at 42 per cent, of the weight of the wet product.

The most striking feature of these experiments is the 
exceptional yield obtained in the mulched plot. It is 
reported that the soil in this plot was in excellent physical 
condition and was well covered by trees planted at the 
rate of 108 trees per acre, whereas the control-plot 
requires 178 trees to cover the ground. 

The cocoa yielded by this plot in six years has exceeded 
that of the control-plot by over 40 per cent. It is, how- 
ever, important to notice that plot No. 4, which was 
manured with dried blood, phosphate, and potash, shows 
an increased yield of 33' 98 per cent, over that of the 
control-plot, but plots Nos. 2 and 3, the first of which was 
manured with phosphate and potash, and the second 
with dried blood, show together an increased yield oi 
38' 23 per cent, over that of the control-plot. 



68 RESULTS OF MANURIAL EXPERIMENTS

The Botanical Department in Grenada has conducted 
experiments on several cocoa estates situated in different 
parts of that island with a view to demonstrating the 
advantages accruing from good cultivation in conjunction 
with manurial applications. The subjoined tables in-

From Table No. 2 it will be seen that the weight of 
cured beans from 100 fruits varies from 7*5 Ib. with 
Caracas to 9' 8 Ib. from Forastero, the average from the 
three kinds which are present in varying numbers on all 
the plots being 8'451b. 

Taking the sulphate of ammonia, Plot No. Ill, with a 
yield of 11,070 fruits, the weight of dry cocoa per acre 
would be 8J cwt., which is very high, whilst the cost of 
the manure is only 23' 12 Rs. (1 10s. Wd.) per acre per 
annum. 

The yield from the unmanured plots is equivalent to 
4J cwt. of dry cocoa per acre. 

It is difficult to understand the extraordinary manner 
in which the yields of specific plots have fluctuated from 
year to year. In drawing comparisons between the 
yields of different plots the reader is recommended to 
bear in mind that the 1907 annual report on these ex- 
periments states : " Although the results of the manure 
experiments are recognised to have amply justified their 
existence in every case, yet at the same time it is felt 
that the plots are not of a representative and uniform 
character, because the trees were originally planted 



ESTIMATING MANURIAL RESULTS 75 

irrespective of distance ; they are therefore to be 
thinned out and left at as much as possible a uniform 
distance of about 12 ft., and wider if possible"; and "a 
careful examination of all the plots at the present time, 
however, shows that unless the greatest care is exercised 
the figures of yields are rather misleading owing to 
several reasons, the chief being the irregularity of the 
bearing trees in each plot and the irregular cutting out 
of diseased trees, and supplying of new ones during the 
last few years." Also, " The manuring and improvement 
of old cocoa is the chief object of the experiments ; but 
as it is almost impossible to obtain identical conditions 
on each plot, under those prevailing at Gangaruwa when 
the estate was first taken over, it is better to look at the 
matter from a general point of view, rather than to base 
calculations of profit or loss on erroneous or misleading 
figures." It is further pointed out that the manures 
containing much nitrogen had a marked effect on in- 
creasing the growth of foliage, and in the case of sulphate 
of ammonia on the crop likewise. Even when certain 
nitrogenous manures, such as blood meal, crushed fish, 
castor and ground-nut cake were applied in conjunction 
with basic slag and sulphate of potash, no marked 
beneficial effect was observable in the yield. It is, 
however, evident that sulphate of ammonia and a mix- 
ture of sulphate of ammonia and basic slag are among 
the best manures for cocoa. Good returns were obtained 
the season following the f orking-in of leaves with an excess 
of lime, but subsequently the yield deteriorated, and the 
trees developed too much leaf growth. As the soil is 
rich in lime applications of this material did not have a 
beneficial effect upon the yield. 

The soil is poor in potash, but the results obtained from 
the plots treated with potash manures are of rather an 
uncertain nature. It is pointed out that there was a 
tendency for manures to encourage a maximum yield 
in December instead of November, maintaining the 
increase until January ; thus indicating that a plentiful 
supply of plant-food at the flowering and fruit-setting 
period checked the dropping of immature fruits, and points 
to the advisability of applying soluble manures im- 
mediately previous to the principal flowering periods. 



CHAPTER XI 

DISEASES 

FOR the cocoa planter to adopt preventive or combative 
measures in an intelligent manner against the various 
pests to which cocoa is subject, it is necessary that he 
should acquire a knowledge of the principles of phyto- 
pathology, which involves an understanding of the 
symptoms, causes, and the life history of plant diseases. 

In attempting a diagnosis of plant diseases it is import- 
ant that he should be able to differentiate between 
symptoms due to the action of organisms and those due 
to environment. For example, a discoloration of the 
foliage may have been caused either by fungus mycelium 
present in the internal structure of the leaf or by excessive 
moisture at the roots of the tree. The therapeutic 
measures to apply to the former ailment would obviously 
have to differ widely from those applicable to the latter. 

The etiology or causes of plant disease may be included 
in two main groups ; the first is associated with its inani- 
mate environment, such as soil, light, atmosphere, or 
temperature, while the second is connected with the 
work of living organisms, such as plants and animals. It 
is necessary to point out, however, that the effects of 
the work of the living organisms are influenced by the 
inanimate environment as well as by the host plant. 
A plant growing under satisfactory conditions as regards 
soil and climate is better equipped to withstand disease 
than one growing in a sour or water-logged soil, or one 
growing in an unsuitable temperature. 

In the case of the cocoa tree too dense shade predis- 
poses it to fungus disease. A lack of nutriment in the 
soil, constricted root or foliage space, may likewise be 
placed in this category. A definition of disease as affect- 

76 



FACTORS CONDUCIVE TO DISEASE 77 

ing the cocoa tree, for the purpose of this work, may be 
considered as the variation from the normal of functions 
which threaten the life of the tree, and this implies danger 
of premature death. 

In maintaining the plant in a good state of health by 
a careful observance of its requirements in regard to soil, 
light, and air, the planter is adopting the best preventive 
measures against disease. 

Serious epidemics of disease rarely occur amongst 
plants growing in a wild state. This is mainly due to 
the fact that a specific disease almost invariably con- 
fines its attacks to nearly allied species. Under natural 
conditions, large numbers of unrelated plants grow 
intermixed, and it very rarely happens that a single 
species of plant monopolises a large area of land. Any 
particular diseased plant is more or less isolated and the 
spread of the disease to plants of a similar species is 
thus checked, as the plants in the immediate vicinity 
are unrelated and are consequently more or less immune 
from this particular disease. 

The practice of cultivating large areas of land with 
a single species of plant is therefore most conducive to 
the diffusion of the various diseases to which the plant 
is subject. In the wild state there is a constant struggle 
for existence, the plants least adapted to grow in any 
particular situation are crowded out by those better 
adapted, which results in the survival of the fittest. 
The very fact of a plant thriving in any particular dis- 
trict in a wild state indicates that the natural conditions 
are favourable for its development. 

When this plant is introduced to a new country and 
is grown under the conditions which cultivation involves, 
some of the factors which might be inimical to its 
growth in a natural state are obviously removed, but it 
is introduced to others to which it was not previously 
subjected. In all probability it will be still affected 
by the various diseases which it encountered in its 
native habitat, but many of the factors which previously 
kept these in check will be absent, and an endemic disease 
may then develop into an epidemic. For example, 
the depredations of an insect, which fed upon its tissues, 
may have been held in check by being preyed upon by 
another in its native home, but the former may be present 



78 DISEASES 

and the latter absent in its new home. Again, the 
hygienic conditions may be more favourable to the 
development of various fungus parasites ; its vitality 
may be weakened by soil or climatic agencies or by 
methods of cultivation. 

It is universally acknowledged that plants like the 
cocoa tree, whose habits have been altered, or " im- 
proved " from the planter's point of view, by long periods 
of cultivation, are more subject to disease than the wild 
types of the same species. That the constitution of 
the cocoa tree has been altered by introduction to, and 
cultivation in, new countries, is amply exemplified by 
the numerous varieties and forms now extant. 

It will therefore be apparent that it is incumbent 
on the cocoa planter to adopt every possible means in his 
power to prevent the introduction of disease into his 
plantation, and when it does appear, to take immediate 
steps to eradicate it. 

The difficulties attending the prevention and exter- 
mination of disease from a permanent crop, such as cocoa, 
are far greater than in the case of an annual crop, for with 
the latter a change of crop will invariably produce the 
desired results. The cultivation of certain inter-crops 
and catch-crops with cocoa might tend to check disease 
diffusion ; and belts of trees, planted at suitable distances 
apart throughout the plantation, would serve both to 
protect the cocoa trees from wind and deter the spread 
of disease. 

For the reasons already mentioned the species chosen 
for the inter-crops, catch-crops, or wind-shelter-belts 
should be selected from those belonging to different 
natural orders of plants from those to which the cocoa 
tree belongs, viz. Sterculiacece . 

The living organisms associated with the diseases of the 
cocoa tree may be divided into two groups, i.e. animals 
and plants. 

Of the vertebrata which are inimical may be men- 
tioned man, monkeys, deer, squirrels, and rats. 

It is, however, among the invertebrata that we find 
the most pernicious pests of the cocoa tree, such as beetles, 
the larvae of beetles and moths, thrips, aphis, etc. 

Plants as factors of disease in cocoa trees can be separ- 
ated into two series, the flowering plants, Phanerogams, 



ANIMAL PESTS 79 

and Cryptogams. The former are represented by such 
well-known types as dodder (Cuscuta spp.) and Loranthus 
leptolobus, which is nearly related to mistletoe ; and the 
latter by fungi. 

ANIMAL PESTS 

Man. The injuries inadvertently caused to cocoa 
trees by man, although perhaps seldom directly respons- 
ible for the death of the tree, nevertheless often facilitate 
the attacks of insects and parasitic fungi. Wounds 
carelessly made on the stem and main branches during 
cultural and pruning operations offer a convenient in- 
fection spot for the spores of various species of wound 
fungi, and such wounds are frequently selected by certain 
beetles to lay their eggs, as affording the larvae which 
hatch therefrom a ready means of entrance to the internal 
tissues of the tree. Wounds made on the roots, in a 
similar manner, render the tree more liable to infection 
by the parasitic fungi which attack these organs. 

Deer occasionally feed on the young growths and 
gnaw the bark from the stem of the cocoa tree, thus 
lowering its vitality and preventing the proper circula- 
tion of sap, and in addition, as mentioned above, affording 
various insects and fungi an opening for attack. 

The only practical methods of checking the attacks of 
these marauders would appear to be by shooting them, 
or by erecting a suitable fence around the plantation. 

Monkeys, Squirrels, and Rats. These three animals 
frequently cause great losses to the cocoa planter by 
their ravages upon the cocoa fruit. They are all ex- 
tremely fond of the sweet mucilaginous pulp in which 
cocoa beans are enveloped. They wantonly destroy 
large numbers of fruits. After gnawing a hole in the 
shell they extract a few beans and leave the remainder 
to decay. The beans extracted are rarely eaten, but are 
thrown down upon the ground, after the mucilaginous 
envelope has been consumed. Such beans germinate 
or decay unless collected shortly after they fall to the 
ground, and even then they only yield an inferior product. 

When the attacked fruits are left upon the trees the 
unprotected tissues afford excellent infection areas for 
the various fungi diseases which affect cocoa fruits, as 



80 DISEASES 

also do the shells and beans left lying about in the plan- 
tation. 

The writer has noticed, both in West Africa and in San 
Thome, frequent instances of cocoa fruits having been 
torn from the trees and carried completely away by 
monkeys. Squirrels are also troublesome in these two 
districts, as well as in Trinidad and Ceylon. Considerable 
damage is caused by squirrels in Ceylon ; the 1907 annual 
report upon the Experiment Station shows that more 
than 60,000 cocoa fruits were damaged during that 
year in the experiment plots. 

Methods of Destroying Rats. The ravages caused by 
rats are, however, far greater than those due to both 
monkeys and squirrels. 

The losses which San Thome planters annually sustain 
from the depredations of rats must be enormous. One 
authority has estimated it at 10,000,000 francs. This 
is probably an exaggeration. Some idea of the number 
of rats which infest the San Thome cocoa estates may 
be gathered from the fact that, the manager of one of 
these estates assured the writer, 16,000 rats were annually 
destroyed on the property. Other countries where rats 
are destructive to the cocoa crop are : Trinidad, Martinique, 
and Samoa. 

The most destructive species in San Thome are M us 
ratus and M . decumanus ; the former is common in Trini- 
dad, as well as the "pouched rat," Heteromys anomalus, 
Thompson, and the " spiny rat," Loncheres guiance, 
Thos. 

It is thus apparent that the planter must look upon 
the rat as a formidable deterrent to profitable cocoa 
cultivation, and when it appears in his plantation it must 
be energetically combated. 

Monkeys, squirrels, and rats may all be caught in traps ; 
poisoned bait can also be effectively used. In San 
Thome large numbers of dogs are trained to hunt the 
rats. 

Farmer's Bulletin, No. 297 of the United States De- 
partment of Agriculture, suggests the following poisoned 
baits for the destruction of rats : One part barium 
carbonate, or barytes, mixed with four parts of meal 
into the form of dough ; or one part barytes mixed with 
seven parts of oatmeal and made into a stiff paste. This 



POISONED BAITS FOR RATS 81 

mixture is tasteless and odourless. When used in 
small quantities sufficient to kill rats it is not injurious 
to larger animals. Its action on rodents is slow but 
fairly sure, and possesses advantages over many similar 
poisons in that the rats, dying from its effects, almost 
invariably leave buildings in search of water. 

Strychnine is also recommended as a rat poison. Half 
an ounce of strychnine sulphate should be dissolved in 
a pint of boiling water, to which should be added and 
mixed a pint of thick sugary syrup. Owing to its viru- 
lence as a poison to man and all animals its employment 
involves considerable risks. Oatmeal dough should be 
thoroughly moistened with this mixture, or wheat should 
be soaked in it to form a bait. 

When a bait likely to be injurious to dogs, cats, or 
poultry is employed it should be placed in a section of 
bamboo pole, open at each end but with a joint in the 
centre. 

Phosphorus preparations should be avoided, as they 
may be carried by rats near inflammable materials and 
cause fire. 

The under-mentioned poisoned baits for the destruction 
of rats are recommended in the Philippine Agricultural 
Review, September 1908 :

The mongoose was introduced with a view to destroy-

to such an extent that a destroyer of the mongoose is 
required. 

Rats cause serious damage in maize farms in Mozam- 
bique, where they attack the seed sown in the field, the 
"cobs" in the field previous to harvesting, and also 

6 



82 DISEASES 

the stored cobs and grain. Experiments instituted by the 
writer with the object of discovering an inexpensive and 
effective means of exterminating them resulted in the adop- 
tion of the " Universal Ant Destroying Apparatus," in 
preference to all other methods tested. This method of 
exterminating rats might be applied with advantage in 
cocoa plantations. The apparatus consists of an air- 
pump connected by a length of rubber hose with a small 
furnace. Glowing charcoal is placed in the latter, and 
a spoonful or so of a mixture, comprising 85 per cent, 
of white arsenic and 15 per cent, sulphur, is thrown 
on the charcoal. When the pump is worked a current 
of air is forced into the furnace. The air enters the 
lower part of the furnace and drives out the poisonous 
fumes, produced by the combustion of the powder, through 
a hole near the top of the furnace, with which is connected 
a second flexible tube. In practice the nose of the latter 
is placed in the largest hole leading to the rat burrow and 
the pump is started. As it is essential to restrict the 
fumes to the burrow as much as possible it is necessary 
before commencing operations to close up all other holes 
leading to the burrow. Sometimes only one other is 
found, but there may be as many as five. The amount 
of fumes required for each burrow depends upon its size, 
but sufficiency is indicated when they commence to issue 
from the hole into which they were originally injected. 
The pump should then be stopped and the hole plugged 
up. Twenty-four hours later the burrow should be 
inspected, and if any openings are found the burrow 
should be treated again. Failure to destroy the rats 
in the burrow by one application is usually due to the 
insecure closing of the various bolt-holes. Should no 
exits from the burrow have been made no further applica- 
tion is necessary. 

INSECT PESTS 

The comparatively recent researches of the Entomo- 
logists attached to the West Indian and Ceylon Botanical 
Departments have furnished much valuable data in re- 
gard to the insects destructive to cocoa in those countries, 
and the writer is indebted to their reports for a great deal 
of the following information on the subject. 



LIFE HISTORY OF INSECTS 83 

Many of the insects recorded do very little damage 
in plantations ; principally because they occur in ex- 
tremely limited numbers ; still, the fact must not be lost 
sight of, that however small the injury caused by a 
particular insect may be, it in all probability would be 
augmented in direct ratio to its multiplication. 

Many insects pass through three stages of existence. 
From eggs are hatched caterpillars or grubs. These 
subsequently change to a pupal or resting stage, i.e. 
chrysalis, from which the "perfect insect" (butterfly, 
moth, or beetle) emerges. It is frequently in the " larval 
or caterpillar stage " that a particular insect is most 
destructive. Whenever a butterfly, moth, or beetle is 
known to be the parent of a troublesome grub, every 
possible means should be employed to destroy it. By 
studying the life history of a destructive insect it is 
sometimes possible to check its ravages by destroying 
its eggs. 

Mosquito Blight, Helopeltis Antonii. This insect was 
originally reported to destroy the young twigs and 
leaves of the cocoa trees, but at the present time it appears 
to be more destructive to the fruits. In a report upon 
"Rubber, Cocoa, etc., in Ceylon, 1903," the writer has 
given the following particulars regarding this pest. 
' The Helopeltis insect was described from Ceylon by a 
French entomologist as far back as 1858, but it was not 
until 1880 that it was reported as being destructive to 
cocoa trees. The insect lays its eggs in the rind of the 
cocoa fruit, where their presence is only evident by the 
long white hairs which protrude from the end of each egg 
in single pairs. In about nine or ten days the eggs 
hatch out into small wingless insects, which grow rapidly 
and eventually produce wings. These insects feed upon 
the sap of the cocoa tree. At the point where the insect 
punctures the fruit the tissues die, and where a large 
number of these punctures occur close together on the 
same fruit the diseased portions unite and the fruit dies. 
In order to check this pest coolies are sent among the 
cocoa trees armed with sticks smeared with the viscid 
sap of the Jak tree, Artocarpus integrifolia ; on this the 
wingless insects are caught, and so expert do the coolies 
become at the work that one will catch as many as 
1,500 insects per day. At one estate that I visited, 



84 DISEASES 

over 200 had been spent in the current year on their 
extermination." 

The eggs of Helopeltis hatch out on the tenth clay, 
the young insects are reddish in colour, and resemble 
small ants. Both the young and the mature insects 
are easily recognisable by the " drumstick," or erect 
knobbed horn, which projects from the middle of the 
back. The insect appears to be most active in the 
early morning, and combative measures would there- 
fore appear to be most successful if employed at this 
time. 

Attempts to destroy this insect at the Experiment 
Station, Peradeniya, Ceylon, by spraying with insecti- 
cides, gave negative results so far as it was possible to 
judge. 

Steirastoma depressum, L. This pest has been recorded 
as injurious to cocoa trees in the following countries : 
Surinam, Venezuela, British Cluiana, and several of the 
West Indian islands. It belongs to the Longicorn 
family of boring beetles, and is about an inch long by 
half an inch broad, black with whitish-grey markings, and 
has jointed antennae longer than the body. The adult 
insect feeds upon young bark, small plants, or twigs ol 
mature trees. 

The female, which is slightly larger than the male, 
lays its eggs in crevices of the bark of the cocoa tree or 
in the angle formed by two large branches. Trees in 
a poor state of health are more commonly attacked than 
healthy trees. The eggs hatch out into grubs, which at 
once commence boring, with their powerful mandibles, 
into the stem tissues. The grubs grow 1| in. long by 
J in. broad, and eventually pass into a resting stage, in 
the form of a chrysalis or pupa. The presence of the grub 
is usually evidenced by the fine sawdust made by its 
boring operations which it ejects from the beginning of 
its tunnel. When the grub is close to the surface it may 
be cut out, but if it is too far away for this to be practic- 
able it may be destroyed by inserting a pliable wire into 
its tunnel. The wounds made by the grub, or in cutting 
it out of the tree, should be painted over with the mixture 
of tar and resin oil already referred to in this work. 

The adult beetles are active by night, but they often 
may be found resting upon the trunk and large branches 



METHODS OF TRAPPING INSECTS 85 

of the cocoa tree in the early morning. At this time of 
day they arc easily caught and can be killed by throwing 
them into a vessel containing a mixture of water and 
kerosene. 

Surinam cocoa planters trap these beetles by tying 
large pieces of the bark of the silk cotton tree to the 
trunks of the cocoa trees, to provide a hiding-place for 
them. 

These traps are examined during the day-time, and 
large numbers of beetles are caught by this means. 

Branches cut from the trees are left on the ground in 
Grenada for two or three weeks. The adult beetles lay 
their eggs in these branches, but these are destroyed as 
the branches are burned. Although it is comparatively 
rare to find a tree which has been killed outright by this 
beetle, its attacks seriously interfere with the health of 
the tree. 

In Grenada it is reported (Journal Royal Society of 
Arts, August 13, 1909) that on one cocoa estate, 200 acres 
in area, 120,000 beetles, larvae, and pupSD have been 
killed in a year at a cost of 50 ; and on a neighbouring 
estate 200,000 were accounted for. 

Another beetle (Adoretus umbrosus) is reported to feed 
upon the leaves of the cocoa trees in Fiji, but is not 
very destructive. 

Preuss reports that the larva? of a Longicorn boring 
beetle (Traqocephala senaioria) is destructive to cocca 
trees in Kamerun. 

Thrips. These minute insects are destructive to 
cocoa trees in most countries where it is grown, and 
especially when the trees are suffering from drought, 
lack of proper plant-food, or other causes. Ballou de- 
scribes a species of thrips, Physopus rubrocincta, common 
in West Indian cocoa plantations, as follows : ' The 
adult insect is from 7 V to T V in. in length ; it is dark brown 
or black, with delicate wings, which are fringed with 
fine hairs. The young, which have no wings, are pale 
green or yellowish green, generally with a bright red 
band extending across the abdomen." These insects 
attack the foliage and fruit ; they are usually found on 
the under surface of the leaves in small colonies. An 
affected leaf is discoloured even on the upper surface, 
and if the thrips be numerous it is killed. In the case 



86 DISEASES 

of fruits, the attacks of thrips also cause discoloration, 
which is often mistaken for that associated with ripeness 
and sometimes results in the harvesting of immature fruits. 
This discoloration of the leaves and fruits is mainly 
caused by the thrips biting and feeding upon the plant 
tissues, but in a less degree damage is due to the incisions 
made by the females in which to lay their eggs. 

As trees in an unsatisfactory state of health are most 
subject to thrips attacks it follows that the best means 
of combating them is to remedy this by better attention 
to the trees' requirements. 

Affected fruit shells should be buried with lime, and 
the trees should be sprayed with the resin wash, whale- 
oil soap solution, or kerosene emulsion described at the 
end of this section. 

Aphis. Aphides, or plant lice, are frequently found 
attacking the young foliage, flowers, and fruit of cocoa 
trees, and their presence is often indicated by the ants 
which follow them for the honey-dew, or sweet fluid, 
which they exude and upon which the ants feed. The 
distorted appearance of mature foliage is often due to 
aphis attacks upon the young growths, and the develop- 
ment of young flower-buds is sometimes prevented by 
similar attacks. Spraying the trees with kerosene 
emulsion or whale-oil soap will generally rid them of 
these pests. 

Twig Girdlers. Various forms of twig-girdling insects 
have been found attacking cocoa trees in the West 
Indies. In Trinidad, Ecthoea quadricornis, Oliver, and 
Tomicus sp. have been observed cutting off small cocoa 
twigs. Another twig girdler, Oncideres amputator, some- 
times attacks cocoa trees in St. Vincent and St. Lucia. 
The female of the species gnaws the wood of a twig, and 
before the twig falls lays an egg in the partially severed 
portion. The larva, which hatches from the egg, is 
thus supplied with the dead or decaying material neces- 
sary for its food. The only practicable means of checking 
the attacks of these pests appears to be in catching 
and destroying the mature insects and in burning the 
twigs on which the eggs have been deposited. 

Mealy Bugs, Dactylopius spp., are another pest of 
cocoa trees, but are only of minor importance. Like 
aphides they frequently attack young leaves and flower 



AN INSECT TROUBLESOME IN UGANDA 87 

buds ; unless they occur in very large numbers they 
do not cause serious damage to more mature parts of the 
tree. Combative measures should be adopted similar 
to those recommended in regard to thrips. 

Ceratitis punctata, Wied, attacks cocoa fruits in Ashanti, 
Gold Coast, and also in Uganda. According to Gowdey 
(Government Gazette, Uganda, October 1909) this insect 
belongs to the Trypetidce, a dipterous or two-winged 
family of vegetable-eating insects. 

The female lays its eggs under the peel of the cocoa 
fruit. Larvae hatch out from these in from twelve to 
fifteen days, and at once commence feeding upon the 
interior tissues of the fruit and interfere with the develop- 
ment of the seeds. 

These larvse measure about half an inch long when 
fully grown, and are then fifty-five or sixty days of age. 

They are footless, colourless, twelve-segmented grubs, 
with prominent dark-coloured mandibles. They pupate 
in the soil at a depth of 2 in. near the stem of the tree. 
The puparium varies in colour from white to pale brown ; 
it is barrel-shaped and segmented. The pupal stage 
lasts from fifteen to seventeen days. 

The ground colour of the adult insect is yellowish 
white ; it has eyes red or purplish, thorax beautifully 
striped and spotted, abdomen, except basal segment, 
spotted and with black bristles at apex, wings with 
fuscous bands and dark spots. 

They appear to feed upon any sweet substance. There 
seems to be no sharply defined season between the broods, 
and breeding is continuous as long as food is available. 

The microscopical examination of several females 
disclosed the presence of an average of fifty eggs each. 
As it is considered there are four broods a year it will 
be observed that if every egg resulted in an adult the 
descendants from a pair of flies at the end of the year 
would number 390,625. This number is only based on 
theory, and would of course never be actually attained. 
Fruits other than cocoa in which the females lay their 
eggs are : mango, melon, guava, and passion-fruits. 

As the adult insects are attracted by sweet substances, 
control measures should take the form of poisoned baits 
of sweet liquids. Gowdey recommends a mixture con- 
sisting of : 3 Ib. sugar, | Ib, arsenate of lead, and 5 gallons 



88 DISEASES 

of water, being sprayed so as to form a thin film on the 
trees. Infected fruits should be burned or buried. 

Scale, Aster olecanium spp. These insects sometimes 
occur in considerable numbers on cocoa trees. Several 
trees in Grenada were completely covered with them, and 
it was found necessary to cut down the trees and burn 
them. What is known as " Black blight " is generally 
due to the presence of a fungus, Capnodium sp., which 
obtains its nutrition from the excreta of scale insects. 
Trees badly attacked with scale should be cut down 
and burnt. Mild attacks may be effectively treated 
with the remedies advised for the extermination of aphis 
and mealy bug. 

The Lac Insect, Tachardia Albizzice, Green. The 
branches of the cocoa tree are occasionally attacked in 
Ceylon by the Lac insect. Green (Tropical Agriculturist, 
October 1905) does not consider it does much damage, 
although young growths are occasionally killed by its 
work. 

Deimatostages contumax is the name given by Kuhlgatz 
to a bug which affects cocoa trees in Kamerun. Strunk 
(Der Tropenpftanzer, November 1906) tested various in- 
secticides with a view to deciding upon an effective remedy 
for this pest. He found arsenical compounds gave very 
satisfactory results. Tobacco juice and soap solutions 
also proved effective when applied at the commencement 
of the dry season before the insects became abundant. 

Parasol Ants, Atta cepalotes and A. octospinosa, destroy 
cocoa leaves in Trinidad. Parasol ants are so called 
from their habit of cutting up leaves and flowers and 
carrying them away on their heads to their nests. It is 
stated that they seldom leave their nests during stormy 
or heavy rainy weather, or while the sun is exceptionally 
hot, so this should be the best time to attack them to 
ensure the destruction of the whole nest. Hart recom- 
mends the application of coal tar ; he states that it effec- 
tively destroys the nest, and the ants never return to a 
nest which has been treated in this manner. The " Uni- 
versal Ant Destroyer," previously described, doubtlessly 
could be employed with advantage for the destruction of 
these pests, or carbon bisulphide might be applied to 
the nests with equally good results. This liquid is ex- 
ceedingly volatile, and the fumes which it gives off are of 



THE DESTRUCTION OF TERMITES 89 

a highly inflammable nature. Many shipping companies 
object to carry it, and it is consequently expensive. 

About | drachm, or J cubic cc., of the liquid should 
be poured on a small handful of cotton wool and plunged 
into the nest. If all holes in the nest are closed up with 
moist clay, the fumes, being heavier than air, will descend 
and destroy the ants. 

Termites, or what are erroneously termed white-ants, 
cause serious damage to cocoa trees in San Thome, and 
are responsible for minor injuries to these trees in several 
other countries. In San Thome they indiscriminately 
attack both healthy and unhealthy trees, and at least 
two distinct species occur. Desneux has identified one 
of these as Termes Theobromce ; the other is probably 
a Calotermes, and Plate 6 illustrates the manner in 
which it attacks the trees. Part of the trunk has been 
cut-away to show the extent of the injury, and on the left- 
hand side of the plate is seen a gormandising sucker 
which the tree has produced from the least affected side 
of its trunk. The insects build their nests at the base 
of the cocoa trees and attack the roots. Later, and 
probably after growth has been thus checked, they obtain 
an entrance to the trunk through the tap-root. 

From the trunk their operations are extended to the 
main branches. In its attempts to recover from the 
injuries caused by the insects the tree frequently pro- 
duces one or more gormandising suckers from the base 
of the stem. 

The planter, with a view to encouraging these to take 
the place of the injured portion, frequently cuts the latter 
down. Unless the nest at the base of the tree is destroyed 
the suckers are very soon attacked and the tree is eventu- 
ally killed. 

The nests should be treated by the methods recom- 
mended for Parasol ants. 

An insect has been recently reported as destructive to 
cocoa trees in the Gold Coast. 

When young it resembles a tick or spider and is reddish 
in colour. Mature insects are brown or black, and 
although they generally have wings they can only fly for 
short distances. Both young and old insects have a 
trunk which, when not feeding, is folded back along its 
under-side. Applications of kerosene emulsion have 



90 DISEASES 

been recommended as a combative measure. It is sug- 
gested that seriously attacked trees, which appear to be 
dying, should be cut off 18 in. from the ground and the 
top of the stumps coated with tar. 



INSECTICIDES 

Many of the insect pests previously described cause 
very little damage to cocoa trees, but others, like thrips 
and the Steirastoma larvae, have caused serious damage 
where no attempts were made to exterminate them. 

The fact that a particular insect pest has hitherto not 
proved troublesome affords no criterion of its capa- 
bilities in this respect should conditions more favourable 
for its multiplication occur. The planter should be 
constantly on the look-out for possible pests, and when 
found prompt measures should be taken to exterminate 
them. In order to be in a position to adopt rational 
remedial methods it is necessary that the planter should 
be equipped with the various insecticides which have 
proved beneficial in checking cocoa pests and also with 
suitable apparatus with which to apply them. Different 
insects injure the trees in different ways, and a method 
of attack which would be attended with excellent results 
when applied to check the ravages of one insect might 
be futile against those of another. 

The principal insect pests of cocoa may be classed into 
three main divisions : Boring insects, sucking insects, 
and leaf-eating insects. 

Boring Insects. Under this division may be included 
the various larvae of Longicorn beetles and termites ; the 
means of combating both these pests have already been 
dealt with. 

Sucking Insects. These suck the plant juices by means 
of a slender tube which they insert into the tissues of 
the plant. Plant lice (Aphides), mealy bugs, scale insects, 
etc., are comprised in this division. To exterminate 
these, insecticides known as " contact poisons " are 
generally applied, which kill the insects when the poisons 
come in contact with their bodies. The following are 
some of the mixtures most generally employed for this 
purpose : 

Resin Wash. Thoroughly pulverise 4 Ib. of resin and 




A CoCdA TlU'IK ATTACKKI) BY TERMITES 



r . 90] 



THE PREPARATION OF INSECTICIDES 91 

1 Ib. of caustic soda, and then add to these f pint of 
fish oil. Cover these with about 2 in. of water and boil 
until the solids have dissolved. Slowly add water, 
keeping the mixture up to boiling point, until the whole 
is made up to 3 gallons. This constitutes the stock 
solution. Before application dilute at the rate of 6 gallons 
of water to 1 gallon of the stock solution ; rain-water is 
preferable, as this is not impregnated with lime or other 
minerals. 

The diluted mixture should be sprayed on insect- 
infected trees ; 100 gallons is sufficient to treat an acre 
of cocoa trees, and one man should deal with half an acre 
in a day. 

Resin Compound. Pound 4 Ib. of resin and 3 Ib. of 
common washing soda in a mortar and mix them with 
1 gallon of water. Boil until the solids have completely 
dissolved, then slowly make up the mixture to 5 
gallons by the addition of water. Thoroughly boil until 
a clear brown colour is obtained. This is the stock 
solution, and should be diluted with 25 gallons of soft 
water previous to application. 

Kerosene Emulsion. To prepare this dissolve hard soap 
in the proportion of 1 Ib. to every 2 gallons of boiling 
water. When these have been thoroughly mixed, and 
while the water is hot, slowly add 4 gallons of kerosene 
and well churn with a syringe or force-pump until a 
cream is formed and the oil has become completely in- 
corporated in the soap solution. This forms the stock 
solution, and if it has been properly mixed, no trace of 
oil will be apparent on the surface even after it has been 
standing several days. Before application this should be 
made up to 66 gallons with rain-water or soft water. 

Whale-oil Soap Solution. This is made by mixing 
whale-oil soap at the rate of | Ib. to every gallon of 
boiling water. 

Tobacco Solution is prepared as follows : Steep tobacco- 
leaf, in the proportion of 1 Ib. to every gallon of water, 
for 24 hours, and afterwards strain the resulting liquid 
through a cloth. Dissolve 1 Ib. of hard soap to every 
10 gallons of water. Mix the tobacco water and the soap 
solution at the rate of 1 gallon of the former to 10 gallons 
of the latter, and it is ready for use. 
Resin and Whale-oil Soap Mixture. Take 4 Ib. resin, 



92 DISEASES 

3 Ib. common washing soda, and 10 Ib. whale-oil soap ; 
make the resin and soda into 4 gallons of resin compound 
stock solution as previously suggested. Mix the whale- 
oil soap with 5 gallons of boiling water, and while this 
mixture is still hot add the resin-compound stock solution. 
Previous to application add 4 gallons of soft water to 
every gallon of the mixture of whale-oil soap and resin. 

Leaf-eating Insects. Applications of the " contact 
poisons " will often destroy many leaf-eating insects, but 
better results are obtained by poisoning their food. 

This can be done by spraying affected plants with 
arsenical and other solutions, which may be termed 
" stomach poisons." Since sucking insects obtain their 
food from the interior tissues these will be unaffected 
by such insecticides. 

The following "stomach poisons" will be generally 
found to give satisfactory results : 

Paris Green. This may be effectively applied either 
in powder form or in solution. When it is applied in the 
dry state it should be first mixed with about twice its 
weight of starch, flour, or lime. 

To make Paris Green solution, mix at the rate of Ib. 
Paris Green and 1 Ib. powdered lime to every 100 gallons 
of water. 

London Purple. This likewise may be applied dry or 
in solution. It should be prepared with lime, flour, or 
starch, in a similar manner and in the same proportions 
as suggested for Paris Green. 



VEGETABLE PARASITES AND EPIPHYTES 

THE dodder, Cuscuta spp., and Loranthus leptolobus are, 
strictly speaking, only partially parasitic on the cocoa 
tree, as they derive a certain amount of nourishment 
from the atmosphere. The latter is usually propagated 
on the cocoa tree by means of its seeds, which are 
carried on to the branches by birds. The seed ger- 
minates and its radicle penetrates the interior tissues 
of the branch, where it obtains nourishment, and a 
sucking organ develops at the expense of the cocoa 
tree. Unless checked, Loranthus leptolobus forms dense 
masses, often more than a foot in diameter, which must 
considerably deplete the vitality of its host. This 
parasite, therefore, should be cut out, and the wounds 
thus made should be painted with the tar and resin 
mixture. Epiphytes, such as mosses, lichens, and small 
orchids, often interfere with the development of young 
cocoa buds, and should be carefully removed from the 
tree. Many of the cocoa trees in the hilly districts of 
San Thome are badly infected with various forms of 
epiphytes. The Orchella Weed is very common, and often 
hangs down from the branches in masses a foot long. 
Hariot identified two epiphytes common on cocoa leaves 
in that island as Cephaleuros virescens, Kunze, and Phy- 
copeltis ftabelligera, Hans. Lichens, common on Ceylon 
cocoa trees, are : Physcia speciosa and species of Lecani 
and Ramelinia. 

Fungus Diseases of Cocoa. A large number of fungus 
pests attack the cocoa tree ; some of these are purely 
local, whilst others, such as the "Brown-pod" disease of 
the fruit, Thyridaria tarda, are almost ubiquitous in every 
country where the tree is cultivated. 

It is not proposed to follow the practice adopted by 

93 



94 VEGETABLE PARASITES AND EPIPHYTES 

some writers of describing these various diseases under 
sub-heads in accordance with the particular portion of 
the tree which they generally affect, as some of the pests 
attack indiscriminately several portions of the tree above 
ground. 

Losses sustained through Fungus Diseases. The tre- 
mendous losses which agriculturists in different parts of 
the world have suffered from the ravages of parasitic 
fungi should be sufficient to convince the cocoa planter 
of the advisability of adopting suitable prophylactic 
measures with a view to protecting his trees from similar 
epidemics. 

Rust in Australian wheat, during the season 1890-1, 
is estimated to have robbed the farmer of 2,500,000 
sterling. During the latter year the ravages of parasitic 
fungi in Prussian cereal crops are estimated to have 
entailed a loss amounting to 20,500,000 sterling. The 
Ceylon coffee-leaf disease is reported to have resulted 
in a loss of nearly 15,000,000 sterling in ten years. 

The cocoa planter should make himself acquainted 
with the general habit and the name of the commonest 
groups of the fungus parasites of plants, their means 
of attack, and the conditions which best favour their 
development. He should also bear in mind that many 
of the fungi are facultative. The saprophytes, which 
generally live on dead organic matter, may assume a 
parasitic habit, and parasitic fungi may in iurn adopt 
saprophytic habits. Mycelium, or hypha, which con- 
stitutes the vegetative form of a fungus, performs similar 
functions in the way of assimilating nourishment for the 
fungus plant as roots and leaves perform for flowerirg 
plants. 

The mycelium of parasitic fungi, with comparatively 
few exceptions, remains within the tissues of its host. 
The casual observer therefore only sees the fruiting 
or reproductive stage when that particular fungus plant 
may have completed its destructive work. Consequently 
it does not follow that because the reproductive form 
of a fungus has been discovered on dead tissues, it is a 
saprophyte, as it may have been the cause of their death. 
In the same way a particular fungus must not be con- 
sidered responsible for the death of plant tissues because 
it is found growing on them, as it may be a saprophyte. 



95 

The difficulties associated with the attempts to ex- 
terminate epidemic fungus diseases are amply demon- 
strated by those adopted with regard to " Vine mildew," 
Plasmopara viticola, De Bary, " Wheat rust," Puccinia 
graminis, Pers., and " Coffee-leaf disease," Hemileia 
vastatrix, Berk. The necessity for adopting preventive 
measures by maintaining sanitary conditions in the 
plantation cannot be too strongly urged. Proper culti- 
vation, selecting beans from disease-resistant plants, 
and the burning of diseased tissues are all prophylactic 
measures which also merit general adoption. 

A stock of reliable fungicides, such as those recom- 
mended towards the end of this chapter, should always 
be kept, as well as suitable apparatus, such as sprayers, to 
apply them. A disease treated in its early stages usually 
may be checked and even extirpated, whereas this may 
be impossible if it be allowed to become rampant. 

Vegetative and Reproductive Organs of Fungus Parasites. 
Fungus diseases are most largely disseminated by means 
of spores ; these for all practical reproductive purposes 
may be considered to take the place which seeds occupy 
in regard to flowering plants. Some forms of parasitic 
fungi, however, rarely produce spores, and perpetuate 
themselves by hibernating mycelium. 

Spores are minute bodies, many thousands of which are 
required to cover a threepenny bit. They vary greatly 
in size and colour, and are produced in enormous quanti- 
ties, which are readily distributed by wind, rain, insects, 
animals, man, and numerous other agencies. Any which 
happen to alight on a suitable host germinate, and, if the 
conditions favourable to their development be present, 
spread disease. The most propitious conditions for the 
development of parasitic fungi are heat and mois- 
ture. Sunlight generally acts as a deterrent, so that 
closely planted cocoa trees afford more encouragement 
to disease diffusion than those planted wider apart. 

The blights mentioned in old writings referring to 
cocoa, were doubtlessly mainly due to fungus diseases. 

De Verteuil, in his book on Trinidad, writes : " But 
in the year 1727, according to Gumilla, not a disease of 
the trees, but a blight, attacking the pods (fruits) under 
certain atmospheric influences, destroyed the crops." 

It is, however, only within the last thirteen or fourteen 



96 VEGETABLE PARASITES AND EPIPHYTES 

years that specific cocoa diseases have been systematically 
studied. 

It is probable, therefore, that the majority of the 
recently discovered diseases have been present in cocoa 
plantations for many years. 

In conjunction with the study of the life-histories of 
the fungus parasites responsible for these diseases, 
considerable information has been acquired in regard to 
remedial treatment, which has satisfactorily demonstrated 
that practically the whole of them are amenable to treat- 
ment. Many diseases which had become rampant were 
rapidly reduced to a minimum by careful, systematic 
treatment. It is considered that the additional ex- 
penditure which the remedial measures involved was more 
than compensated for by the increased crops produced 
as a result of the improved sanitary condition of the 
trees. 

Canker Disease, Nectria sp., in Ceylon. A parasitic 
fungus disease, termed canker, was observed in Ceylon 
cocoa plantations in 1889, and Carruthers subsequently 
investigated the life-history of this pest and suggested 
remedial measures (Circular, Royal Botanic Gardens, 
Ceylon, No. 23, 1901). The fungus was referred to the 
genus Nectria, and on estates where the suggested remedies 
were adopted the spread of the disease was appreciably 
checked. This is still the most serious disease which 
affects cocoa in Ceylon. The mycelium of the fungus 
is rapidly diffused through the stem and branch 
tissues, but infected trees may live for months, and 
even years. 

The symptoms associated with this disease are : a 
reduction of the crop, dying-back of branches, and a 
general lack of vigour in the tree. 

Affected parts of the stem and main branches are 
often indicated by moist, dark patches on the bark. If 
such areas be excised the interior tissues of the bark will 
be found discoloured brown or reddish, in marked con- 
trast to the much paler colour of healthy bark. 

If the disease be allowed to develop, a gummy matter 
frequently exudes through the bark of the affected parts. 
Pustules of white or pinkish spores eventually appear on 
the bark, which are carried about by wind, insects, and 
other agencies, and further disseminate the disease. 



EXCISING CANKERED TISSUES 97 

Dense shade and excessive moisture encourage both 
the development of the disease in infected trees and also 
the propagation of the disease. 

The excision of diseased areas and reduction of shade 
were attended with satisfactory results. 

The dry season, when the trees carry a minimum 
quantity of flowers and fruits, is considered the best 
time to carry out the work of excising cankered tissues. 
At least a | in. of the healthy bark surrounding the dis- 
eased portion should be cut away, in addition to the latter. 
A sharp pruning-knife should be employed for this 
operation. Where the cankered tissues extend more 
or less round the stem it would be advisable to remove 
them gradually, so as to avoid "ring-barking" and 
thus killing the tree. 

Trees which have been excised should be examined 
periodically with a view to discovering whether the 
previous operation was effective and if new areas of 
infection have developed. 

All excised tissues should be carefully collected and 
burned, as any left lying about the plantation may be the 
means of infecting healthy trees. It is advisable to anti- 
septicise all wounds made in cutting out the diseased 
tissues by painting them with tar and resin oil. All 
wounds found on the trees should be similarly treated, 
as these afford convenient infection areas for the spores of 
the canker fungus. Badly infected trees which are 
producing healthy suckers from the base of the stem 
should be cut down just above them, as this will en- 
courage the suckers to grow rapidly and to take the 
place of the parent tree. Branches or trees killed by 
canker should be pruned down and burned. 

The advisability of reducing the shade to let in more 
sunlight to the cocoa trees should also receive due con- 
sideration. Where trees are densely shaded the excision 
of cankered tissues will not be attended with satisfactory 
results. Wright (loc. cit.) states : " On one area where 
the excising, collecting, and burning of cankered tissue was 
subsequent to the thinning out of the shade, the yield of 
the cocoa has been increased from 1 cwt. to approxi- 
mately 5 cwt. per year. On an adjacent area where the 
shade was allowed to remain dense, but the other curative 
methods adopted, the yield remained almost stationary,

the increase being only in this case from f to 1 cwt. per 
acre per year. 

The table given below shows the cost of canker 
excision and burning of diseased tissues at the Experi- 
ment Station, Peradeniya, Ceylon, during the year 1907

From the above-mentioned figures it is seen that the 
total cost per year of excising and burning diseased 
tissues on a cocoa estate affected with canker only 
amounted to 3 rupees 9 cents (4s. \\d.} per acre. 

This expenditure cannot be considered excessive when 
the gradual depletion of the crop is at stake. It should, 
however, be pointed out that the excising of cankered 
tissues commenced on the plantation in 1902, at which 
time nearly every tree was affected by the disease. The 
first year's operations are reported to have cost 17 rupees 
(1 2s. Sd.) per acre, and that of the several following 
years cost from 8 to 12 rupees (10s. 8d. to 16s.) per acre. 
During this period diseased trees were reduced from 96 
to 6 per cent. 

Canker in the West Indies. The principal fungus 
parasites responsible for cankered cocoa trees in the West 
Indies are Nectria Theobromce, Massee, and Calonectria 
flavida, Massee. Both of these parasites are sometimes 
found in the same diseased area, and at other times they 
occur alone. 

The symptoms of the West Indian canker diseases 
differ slightly from those of Ceylon canker. In the 
former, the bark of diseased areas presents a peculiar 



THE SYMPTOMS OF CANKER IN COCOA 99 

dry, greyish-brown aspect. The diseased bark is most 
evident during the dry season immediately after a shower 
of rain, as it does not dry so rapidly as healthy bark. 
During the early stages of the attack the bark, when 
cut, shows only a slight discoloration, but when the 
disease is more advanced a cut reveals a deep claret 
coloration. In the latter condition the bark is soft 
and moist, and the exterior, woody tissue is usually 
affected and assumes a dark brown colour. A brownish- 
red, gummy fluid subsequently oozes out of cracks which 
form in these areas ; this is known as the bleeding stage. 
The dried, gummy exudations impart a rusty appearance 
to the bark. 

Branches are frequently killed by becoming "ringed " 
with the canker, and even whole trees are destroyed when 
the disease affects the trunk near the ground. 

One of the effects of canker on cocoa trees in Dominica 
is the production of an abnormal number of flowers which 
do not mature fruit. Cocoa trees which annually produce 
a phenomenally large number of flowers, and have never 
been known to produce mature fruits, have been observed 
by the writer both in the Gold Coast and in San Thome ; 
in these instances this was purely a teratological char- 
acter, as the trees exhibited not the slightest trace of being 
diseased. 

The fructifications of both Nectria Theobromce and 
Calonectria flavida usually may be found on diseased bark 
during the rainy season. 

Two forms of spores are produced, viz. conidiospores and 
ascospores. The former appear first in the form of white 
pustular-like mould through cracks in the diseased bark. 
Later in the same places, colonies of perithecia appear. 
A single perithecium is about the size of a grain of red 
pepper and contains numerous asci in which the ascospores 
are placed. The perithecia of Nectria Theobromce are 
red, while those of Calonectria flavida are yellow. 

The preventive and remedial measures to apply to these 
parasites are similar to those suggested with reference to 
the canker disease of cocoa in Ceylon. 

Die-back and Brown-Pod Disease, Thyridaria tarda. 
For the following remarks on this ubiquitous cocoa 
pest, the writer is 'indebted to Mr. H. Bancroft, of 
the Jodrell Laboratory, Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew : 



100 VEGETABLE PARASITES AND EPIPHYTES 

" Diplodia cacaoicola (Thyridaria tarda) was described 
by Hennings in 1896 on the wood of the cacao plant i'rom 
Kamerun. It has since then been shown to occur in 
Tropical America (including the West Indies), Java, 
Samoa, Ceylon, the Philippines, and San Thome. It ranks 
among the most injurious of the pests of cacao and also 
possesses the widest area of geographical distribution. 

" The fungus attacks the stem and fruits of the cacao 
plant. On the stem the disease is popularly known as 
' die-back.' The young shoots first show symptoms of 
disease ; they commence to die at their tips and proceed 
to die back toward their bases ; if the disease is allowed 
to proceed unchecked the older branches and finally the 
trunk usually become affected. In some cases the growth 
of the fungus has been known to be limited to a definite 
area on the trunk or on a branch ; it then produces a 
canker-like spot on this area. 

" On the fruits the disease is known as ' brown-pod ' ; it 
makes its appearance in the form of a discoloration at 
one or other end of the fruit. The discoloured area 
extends until the whole, or nearly the whole surface 
of the pod becomes dark brown in colour. The fungus 
spreads through the tissues of the ' shell ' to the mucila- 
ginous coat surrounding the beans and finally attacks 
the beans themselves. 

" The fungus can only effect an entrance into the stem 
through a wound ; in the case of the fruit, however, it 
appears to be capable of entering through the unwounded 
basal or stigmatic ends. All wounds made on the stem 
by pruning, or such as have arisen from other causes, 
should be sealed with coal-tar or with a mixture of coal- 
tar and clay. Care should be taken not to confuse the 
disease caused by Diplodia (Thyridaria) with the dying 
off of the tips of young shoots which commonly occurs on 
cacao plantations from drought, want of shade, etc. 
Diseased shoots should be cut off at a distance of 6 in. to 
1 ft. from the nearest dead end ; diseased fruits should be 
removed from the tree. All diseased material should be 
buried in pits with lime. A vigorous growth of the plant 
induced by good sub-soil drainage, green manuring, and 
careful pruning has been shown to render it less liable to 
attack. Spraying of the fruits with ' Bordeaux Mixture ' 
has yielded good results in some countries. Spraying 



"BROWN -POD" AND " DIE -BACK " DISEASES 101 

should commence when the fruits are just ' set,' and 
should be repeated at intervals of two or three weeks. 

" The fungus is known to occur on other hosts ; in the 
West Indies it occurs on the sugar cane, on Castilloa, and 
has recently been reported to cause a root-disease of the 
Coco-nut Palm ; in Ceylon it is said to cause the later 
stages of a ' die-back ' disease of Hevea brasiliensis, and 
also to occur on tea and on Albizzia moluccana." 

In addition to the countries quoted by Bancroft, 
Thyridaria tarda occurs in cocoa plantations in the 
Gold Coast and Fernando Po. 

The life-history of this parasite was worked out by 
Howard. The spores are produced just beneath the 
epidermis in Pycnidia. They are first expelled in the 
form of white powdery dust, which later turns black, and 
consists of elliptical, uniseptate, brown-black spores. He 
conducted experiments which indicated that the fungus 
is a wound parasite and capable of readily infecting trees 
in which wounds are present or those not in a vigorous 
state of health. 

The fungus is facultative and able to live on both dead 
and living fruits and branches. It is therefore obvious 
that when the disease is prevalent, dead tissues should be 
buried as a preventive measure. 

An experiment conducted on the La Perle estate, St. 
Lucia, has shown that this disease may be defeated by 
high cultivation, manuring, and attention to careful 
pruning. It has been almost exterminated on this estate, 
and the yield of cocoa is reported to have been increased 
from almost nil to over 1,000 Ib. of cured cocoa per acre in 
six years. 

Thyridaria tarda causes serious losses to San Thome 
cocoa planters. Its attacks are, however, mainly re- 
stricted to the fruits, which it attacks in all stages. It is 
most prevalent during the rainy season, in densely shaded 
areas and in hilly districts where the atmosphere is 
frequently saturated with mist. 

On one large estate which the writer visited the disease 
was almost absent from those portions which were situated 
at from 1 to 400 ft. above sea level, but gradually in- 
creased in virulence from the latter elevation up to 
2,000 ft. 

On some of the trees growing at the last-mentioned 



102 VEGETABLE PARASITES AND EPIPHYTES 

elevation as many as 95 per cent, of the fruits were 
attacked. When the young fruits are infected their 
growth is arrested as the disease develops and the beans 
are not matured. The fruit turns brown, the tissues de- 
compose, and they may fall to the ground or remain on the 
tree and infect healthy fruits. When the disease attacks 
a fruit at a later stage it may grow to its normal size and 
be harvested with properly matured fruits ; it differs 
from them, how r ever, as both the enveloping mucilage and 
the integuments are usually dried up and sour smelling. 
Once a fruit has been infected with the disease there 
appears to be no means of checking its spread. The 
importance of burying diseased fruit shells and fruits 
which have been destroyed by the fungus previous to 
maturation cannot be too much insisted on. 

When the shade is too dense this should likewise receive 
attention. 

Good results are reported to have attended the spray- 
ing experiments carried out at the Experiment Station, 
Peradeniya, Ceylon, to check a fungus disease of cocoa 
fruits. The following table, taken from the 1907 Report 
of the Ceylon Botanical Department, demonstrates the 
reduction in the number of diseased fruits harvested.

Bordeaux Mixture was the fungicide employed, and 
the same report shows that the fruits on 196 acres of 
cocoa trees were sprayed at a total cost for labour of 
82' 6 Bs. (5 10^. l^d.), or an average cost of 6fd. per 
acre. 

Witch-Broom Disease, Colletrotrichum luxiferum. This 



LOSSES THROUGH " WITCH-BROOM " DISEASE 103 

disease is also due to a fungus parasite ; it has caused 
serious damage in Surinam cocoa plantations, and has 
also been found on cultivated cocoa trees in British 
Guiana and Trinidad. The extent of the losses sustained 
by the ravages of this pest in Surinam may be estimated 
by the falling off of the cocoa crop from 1,290 tons in 
1895 to 464 tons in 1899. The popular name of this 
disease is due to the hypertrophied growths that it 
induces ; which in conjunction with the numerous 
lateral branches, formed in clusters, resemble small 
brooms. Fruits are also affected by it ; these do not 
develop to a normal size, but become indurated. The 
parasite responsible for this disease was originally de- 
scribed as Exoascus Theobromce, Ritz Bos, but the more 
recent and extensive researches of Van Hall and Drost 
in Surinam have proved that it is due to an entirely 
different fungus, i.e. Colletrotrichum luxiferum. The 
following information on this subject has been extracted 
from Fredholm's translation (Proceedings of the Agri- 
cultural Society, Trinidad) of the report of these two 
investigators. 

The first symptoms of the disease are usually the 
abnormal development of shoots, which are generally 
from two to six times as thick as healthy ones, in con- 
junction with a strong tendency to produce side shoots 
and leaves which remain soft and flimsy. On diseased 
twigs the buds begin to grow before they have 
matured ; they seldom bear leaves themselves, but are 
supported at the base by an abnormal leaf. Some 
trees have been observed which did not carry a single 
healthy twig. 

The texture of the " witches'-brooms " is herbaceous 
and fleshy, and they never become woody. The growths 
develop quickly, but their life is short, drying from the 
base upwards and dying in about two weeks. Severely 
attacked trees are covered with " witches'-brooms " ; 
when these latter die, infection of the tree by wound 
parasites is facilitated, and Thyridaria tarda, the " die- 
back " disease previously described, is commonly met 
with on such trees. 

In addition to the induration of the fruits which the 
disease occasions, the fruit-stalks and even the fruits 
themselves may be hypertrophied. In the latter case 



104 VEGETABLE PARASITES AND EPIPHYTES 

one or more "humps" are formed which, when cut in 
section, show brown streaks in the affected tissues. Such 
fruits never ripen, but fall before they are half grown. 
Other disease-infected fruits show one or two black 
blotches, the tissues of the shell are stone hard, changing 
first to a brown and later to a black colour, and 
eventually die. These fruits may contain beans which 
are apparently sound, together with several mucila- 
ginous beans. 

Another symptom of the disease is that of " Star 
blooms," which consists in the production of a large 
number of flowers crowded together, vegetative shoots 
developed into small " witches' -brooms " being frequently 
found among the flowers. The "cushions " from which 
the flowers arise may be hypertrophied, from which spring 
side shoots that branch and give rise to fascicles of flowers. 
Fully developed fruits are rarely produced from " Star 
blooms," but irregularly shaped fruits are sometimes 
formed, which on being cut in section are found to 
consist of a thick rind with five small cavities devoid 
of beans. 

It is considered that infection of both twigs and flowers 
takes place only at very early stages of their develop- 
ment, and that this is effected by spores which fall on 
vegetative buds or on the cushions from which flower- 
buds issue. 

The productive capacity of certain trees is diminished, 
while others die from the effects of this disease. 

Before the outbreak of the disease in Surinam 
the average yield of cured cocoa was estimated at 
440 Ib. per acre; in 1904 the yield had fallen to 
72J Ib. per acre. The area under cocoa cultivation 
had decreased from 15,828 acres in 1903 to 13,481 
in 1908 as a result of the abandonment of diseased 
plantations. 

Owing to the decreased vitality of affected trees they 
are rendered more susceptible to the attacks of the 
"cocoa beetle" (Steirastoma depressum). 

With regard to trees dying, it seems possible that in 
most cases Thyridaria tarda is eventually responsible for 
death, as it enters the dead " brooms " and then pene- 
trates into the living tissues. 

Young plants, placed out in the vacancies caused by 



PREVENTIVE MEASURES FOR " WITCH -BROOM " 105 

the death of trees from disease, are generally attacked, 
so that only a few survive. Not infrequently whole 
nurseries of young plants are destroyed. 

It has not been noticed that any particular variety of 
cocoa is less susceptible to the disease than others. 

The quantity of shade appears to have no influence on 
it, but humidity is favourable to its development. 

The remedial measures suggested consist of the lopping 
and burning of all leaf-bearing branches, tarring the ends 
of the stumps, and spraying the pruned trees with a 
3 per cent, solution of sulphate of copper. This solution 
not only destroys the fungus spores, but moss and similar 
small epiphytes on the trees as well. The " Deming 
Success " pump-sprayer was employed to apply the spray, 
and is reported to have given satisfaction. 

Trees which were treated in this manner produced new 
crowns in a surprisingly short time, and comparatively 
few " witches'-brooms " appeared during the first year 
following the pruning operation. 

The principal dry season, when growth is least active, 
is considered the best time to carry out the work of 
pruning and spraying. 

Subsequent pruning operations recommended entail 
the removal of undesirable growths which form on the 
trunk and main branches, and also of any "witches'- 
brooms " which appear, together with a small portion 
of the growth below the diseased area. 

Trees which had been lopped commenced to produce 
new foliage in from fourteen to twenty-one days. A few 
of these trees yielded fruit the first year after being 
lopped. Two years after lopping a moderate crop was 
obtained, but it is anticipated that a normal crop would 
not be yielded until the third season. A plantation of 
cocoa trees which had been treated in the manner 
described above yielded 5, 2J, and 2 per cent, of in- 
durated fruits during the first, second, and third years 
respectively following the lopping. 

The rate at which the yielding capacity of lopped trees 
increases is well demonstrated by the results of the 
experiments described below :

The crop from the pruned trees was doubled in the 
first three years, while that of the first four years was 
nearly three times as great as that from the untreated 
trees, although no crop was obtained from the pruned 
trees during the first year following the pruning. 

The indurated fruits produced in the experiment fields 
was 5 per cent, and 2 per cent, in 1906 and 1907 re- 
spectively, while those produced by the untreated trees 
amounted to 50 per cent, of the ripe fruits harvested in 
April and May. 

At another estate where lopping experiments were 



FUNGUS DISEASES IN THE WEST INDIES 107 

carried out in 1905 an average yield of 1'32 kilos, of 
cocoa per tree was obtained in 1908. From another 
block of trees which were lopped in 1905, an average 
yield of 1'347 kilos, of cocoa per tree was harvested in 
1908. 

The expenditure incurred by lopping and spraying is 
estimated at Is. Sd. per acre, which was compensated 
for by the increased yield obtained within two years. 

Lasiodiplodia. The complete life-history of this fungus 
parasite of the cocoa tree has not been fully investigated. 
It occurs in cocoa plantations in San Domingo, Brazil, 
and several of the West Indian islands. Barrett, who 
spent several months in 1907 studying the various fungus 
diseases attacking cocoa trees in Trinidad, estimated that 
between 50 and 75 per cent, of the young cocoa fruits 
are destroyed by fungus parasites in that island. Of 
the total losses suffered from these pests he considered 
90 per cent, were due to a species of the genus Lasio- 
diplodia. It infects the fruits, stems, and branches, and 
it is considered possible that the roots are also infected 
by it. 

Infection experiments carried out at Dominica tended 
to prove that this fungus is only weakly parasitic in habit, 
and it was therefore supposed that infection might take 
place through wounds. In Dominica the growth of the 
fungus is said to be slow and trees may be infected for a 
considerable time before they are killed. 

According to Barrett the disease known as " brown 
rot " in Trinidad is due to Lasiodiplodia. The invasion 
of the skin of the fruit, especially in its earlier stages, 
occurs either at the tip or at the base. Spores lodging 
in the sinus, at the junction of the pedicel and the fruit, 
where moisture is more constantly present than on any 
other portion of the fruit surface, may germinate and 
effect an entrance through the cuticle into the tissues of 
the fruit- wall. As rain and dew also collect at the 
opposite or stigmatic end of the fruit it is considered 
possible that germinating spores may less frequently 
inoculate the fruit at this point. 

The mycelium of the fungus spreads through the 
tissues of the fruit-wall and then attacks the mucilaginous 
envelope of the beans and eventually the beans them- 
selves. Infected fruits in Dominica and Grenada present 



108 VEGETABLE PARASITES AND EPIPHYTES 

a scabby appearance ; small, blackish, corky patches 
being produced on the surface. Such fruits do not 
properly develop, and they do not usually decay, but 
the beans are frequently smaller than those of healthy 
fruits. Specimens of diseased roots and stems of cocoa 
were examined by the Mycologist of the West Indian 
Department of Agriculture. Large numbers of septate, 
dark-coloured mycelial threads were found in the vessels 
of the roots, as well as in the vessels, medullary rays, 
and other cells of the stems. 

Trees affected with this disease in Dominica lack 
vigour, present a dwarfed appearance, and the branches 
die back. Blackish fructifications have been noticed 
pushing through the bark. Cankered trees have been 
observed in Grenada, where Lasiodiplodia appeared to be 
following the old canker-affected areas. Canker is, 
however, attributed to this disease in Trinidad. 

Manuring and high cultivation have been attended 
with good results in regard to cocoa trees affected with 
this disease in Dominica. It is generally found in districts 
where the soil is not well suited for the cultivation of 
cocoa. Where the fungus causes canker it should be 
attacked by the measures already suggested with refer- 
ence to cankered trees. If it attacks the fruits and causes 
the branches to die back the remedies recommended in 
regard to Thyridaria tarda might be applied. 

Black Rot of Fruits, Phytophthora omnivora, De Bary. 
This disease is ubiquitous in cocoa plantations in both 
Trinidad and San Thome, and has also been found attack- 
ing cocoa in St. Lucia, St. Vincent, British Guiana, and 
Surinam. Affected fruits are turned black and become 
covered with the mycelium of the fungus. The ovate 
conidia borne upon the mycelium are carried about by 
the usual agencies, and disseminate the disease. Conidia 
which fall on fruits germinate, and if the conditions be 
favourable, penetrate the fruit-wall. The fungus mycelium 
then rapidly spreads through the tissues and frequently 
destroys the fruit. The latter becomes black and hard ; 
it may hang on the tree for a considerable time and is 
eventually enveloped in white mycelium and conidia. 

Resting spores (oospores) are formed by a sexual process 
within the fruit, and these are liberated when the latter 
decays and still further aid in spreading the disease. 



ROOT DISEASE OF COCOA TREES 109 

Dense shade and excessive moisture favour the develop- 
ment of the parasite, so that when these conditions obtain 
they should be remedied. All affected fruits should be 
collected and buried with lime, which destroys the disease 
producing organisms. Where the disease is prevalent 
it would be also advisable to treat in a similar manner 
the shells of ripe fruits from which the beans have been 
extracted. Should the disease show signs of developing 
into an epidemic spraying the trees with Bordeaux 
Mixture must be resorted to. 

Another species of Phytophthora, viz. P. Faberi, 
Maublanc, is responsible for cocoa fruit disease in 
Ceylon, and it has already been shown that spraying 
with Bordeaux Mixture was attended with satisfactory 
results. 

Root Disease. The roots of cocoa trees have been 
frequently found attacked by fungus mycelium, the 
parasite being unidentifiable as no reproductive bodies 
were discovered. Barber investigated such a disease 
in Dominica in 1892-3, as also did Howard in Grenada 
some nine years later. A similar disease has been re- 
ported from Jamaica and St. Lucia, and the writer has 
recently observed the roots of cocoa trees affected in a 
like manner in San Thome. 

Although no reproductive bodies were found in the 
latter case the general habit and effects closely resemble 
those of Armillaria mellea. An affected tree presents 
an unhealthy appearance. The foliage is under-sized 
and of a yellowish hue. Gradually the young branches 
die and eventually the whole tree may be destroyed. 
It is not infrequent to find several contiguous trees 
affected in this manner. 

Diseased roots turn black and eventually decay. Upon 
careful examination white mycelial threads are observed . 
These frequently form a web between the bark and the 
woody tissues of the root. The interior tissues are also 
permeated by the mycelium, and when all the principal 
roots have been attacked the tree dies. Although the 
young mycelium is white it later becomes grey and eventu- 
ally may assume a pale brown tint. 

The underground mycelium passes from the roots of 
one cocoa tree to those of another providing they be 
adjacent, or it may in the same way pass from a cocoa 



110 VEGETABLE PARASITES AND EPIPHYTES 

tree to a shade tree. Its origin in some instances has been 
traced to the roots of shade trees. 

Stockdale, who has investigated a fungus root-disease 
affecting cocoa trees in the West Indies, remarks (Fungus 
Diseases of Cocoa, etc., Pamphlet Series, No. 54, 1908, 
Imperial Department of Agriculture for the West Indies) : 
" Trees are rarely killed off singly, but usually in patches. 
These patches of dead trees, unless something is done, 
increase in size ; and it has been observed in Dominica, 
when the disease has been neglected, that areas of nearly 
an acre in extent have been destroyed. It has been 
frequently noticed though this is not always the case 
that these patches, when they are quite small, are cir- 
cumscribed by the spread of roots from trees that have 
been used for shade. Pois-doux, bread-fruit, bread-nut, 
mango, pomme-rose, and avocado pear, which are dead 
or dying, have been commonly observed in the centre 
of a diseased area of cocoa, and it has been suggested 
that the fungus attacks the dead or dying roots of these 
trees and then affects the young roots of the cocoa. . . . 
In Dominica it has been found that cocoa has become 
affected where none of the above-mentioned trees were 
present, and it was difficult, owing to the length of time 
that elapsed since the disease first appeared and when 
investigations were made, to establish clearly at what 
spot the disease commenced." 

The same writer suspects that more than one species 
of fungus may be associated with the malady, and that 
the disease may originate from the fungi found on the 
decaying logs lying about the plantation. If the latter 
surmise be correct it is obviously necessary for the cocoa 
planter to destroy by fire all such logs as well as any 
dying trees in the plantation. 

Trees affected with the disease should be isolated by 
digging a trench at least 2 ft. deep and 1 ft. wide around 
them. The soil taken from the trench should be thrown 
within the disease-infected area. Trees adjacent to the 
diseased area should be frequently examined and any 
which show signs of disease infection should be isolated 
in a similar manner. Stockdale (loc. cit.) recommends 
that the whole of the trees in the isolated area should 
be examined and those most badly diseased extracted 
and burned. Trees less seriously affected should have the 



PREVENTIVE MEASURES FOR ROOT DISEASE 111 

soil removed from their principal roots and the diseased 
portions removed and burned. The holes made around 
the trees by the removal of soil should be given a dressing 
of about 5 Ib. of lime, and the soil should then be replaced. 
Where the root area has been considerably reduced the 
branches should be heavily pruned to prevent the tree 
suffering from excessive transpiration. 

He further advises that the whole of the isolated 
area should then be properly forked and a dressing of 
quicklime broad-casted at the rate of about 10 Ib. per 
tree. Later, applications of pen manure and mulchings 
should be given, and in the succeeding year a dressing of 
lime at the rate of 3 or 4 Ib. per tree should be given. It 
is reported that in Dominica and St. Lucia, where planters 
have adopted remedial measures similar to those pre- 
viously described, considerable numbers of trees have 
been saved. It has been amply demonstrated that when 
such measures have been adopted during the early stages 
of the attack the disease may be successfully treated. 

Pink Disease, Corticium lilaco-fuscum. Cocoa trees 
attacked by this disease have been observed in Dominica 
and St. Lucia, but up to the present no serious damage 
has been attributed to it. 

Young branches frequently become incrusted with 
the pink fungal threads of this parasite ; these force their 
way into the bark tissues and may even penetrate the 
wood of young growths. As a result the bark cracks 
and peels off, but branches are rarely completely killed 
by the disease. 

It is, however, necessary to keep the disease in check, 
as the fissures which it causes in the bark afford convenient 
infection areas for the spores of the various wound fungi. 
Badly infected branches, or any which may be killed by 
the disease, should be pruned off and burned. Stockdale 
is of opinion that the fungus may be destroyed by washing 
affected branches with a lime-sulphur wash. The latter 
may be made by mixing 7^ Ib. of slaked lime with 2 Ib. 
of flowers of sulphur in 10 gallons of water, and boiling 
this mixture until it turns an orange colour. 

Affected branches should be well rubbed with the 
mixture when it has become cold. 

Thread Blights. The branches and leaves of cocoa 
trees in several of the West Indian islands have been found 



112 VEGETABLE PARASITES AND EPIPHYTES 

affected with strands or threads of sterile mycelium. 
.Microscopical examination of these threads by the Myco- 
logist of the West Indian Department of Agriculture 
showed that they are composed of parallel-running, 
fungal hyphse closely woven together. When the hyphse 
penetrate through the cortex to the deeper tissues of a 
growth the latter is frequently destroyed. Leaves and 
young buds may be killed in a similar way. 

Thread blights are spread by the mycelium on dead 
twigs and leaves which are carried by the wind to healthy 
trees. 

A disease of a somewhat similar nature was observed 
by Hart on cocoa trees in Trinidad. The threads closely 
resemble a tuft of horse-hair caught in the twigs, and the 
name "horse-hair " blight has been given to this disease. 
In this case some of the threads were closely attached 
to the bark from which hyphse were given off and pene- 
trated to the deeper tissues of the branches. The fungus 
responsible for this disease was determined at Kew as 
Marasmius equicrinus, Mull. 

These diseases are not of a serious nature, and may be 
readily checked by pruning off and burning the affected 
portions of the trees. 

Similar diseases have been recorded in Ceylon, India, 
and Java, where they affect tea and nutmeg, tea, and 
coffee respectively. 

Fungus Diseases of Minor Importance. Nectria Bainii, 
Massee, is the name given by the Kew authorities to a 
disease which attacks cocoa fruits in Trinidad. It 
causes semicircular dark blotches to appear on the fruit- 
walls, and the affected portions become soft and watery. 
Eventually these become covered with a yellow or orange- 
coloured mycelium, from which small, red perithecia are 
produced. 

At present the distribution of this pest is somewhat 
restricted. Probably the methods suggested for the 
control of " brown rot " of the fruits would be effective 
in checking the spread of Nectria Bainii. 

Taphrina Bussei, Faber, or " Balais de Sorciere," is said 
to attack the branches of cocoa trees in Kamerun. The 
remedy suggested is the cutting out and burning of affected 
parts, in conjunction with the heavy pruning of the trees, 
to facilitate the admittance of sun and air. 



PREPARATION OF FUNGICIDES 113 

Fungicides. These are plant poisons diluted to such 
an extent that they are inimical to the thick-walled 
tissues of the host-plants, but are nevertheless sufficiently 
strong to destroy the tender fungus-tissues. It is therefore 
apparent that their application can have no effect upon 
the mycelium within the tissues of the host-plant. 

It has been already pointed out that several of the most 
pernicious fungus parasites of cocoa can be held in check 
by spraying the tree with suitable fungicides. 

The following have been therefore selected from those 
which have given the best results in the treatment of 
these pests. 

Bordeaux Mixture. This is one of the most efficient 
fungicides, and is probably more largely employed than 
any other. It may be prepared in the following manner : 

Weigh 20 Ib. of copper sulphate, and immerse this, 
tied up in a piece of sacking, in 80 gallons of water. 
Slake 15 Ib. lime ; add water in small quantities and stir 
until a perfectly smooth paste is obtained ; then add 
sufficient water to make 80 gallons of lime water. Thor- 
oughly stir this, and when it is cool slowly mix it with 
the water in which the copper sulphate was dissolved. 
It is advisable to prepare the mixture on the same day 
it is required and not to use iron or tin vessels, as the 
copper sulphate corrodes these metals. The mixture, 
after being carefully strained, is ready for use. 

Ammonia and Copper Carbonate Mixture. Take 1 Ib. of 
carbonate of copper and mix this with 51b. of carbonate of 
ammonia, and thoroughly dissolve the mixture in hot 
water. This forms the stock solution, which, previous 
to application, should be diluted by adding sufficient 
cold water to make 256 gallons. 

Potassium Sulphide Solution. Mix potassium sulphide, 
i.e. " liver of sulphur," in the proportion of 1 Ib. to every 
4 gallons of hot water to form the stock solution. This 
must be made up to 36 gallons, by adding cold water, 
before being applied. 

Each of these three mixtures should be applied with 
sprays fitted with nozzles which distribute the solution 
in the form of a fine mist. 



HARVESTING AND TRANSPORTING 

Fruiting Age. The age at which cocoa trees commence 
to bear fruit varies in different countries. In the Gold 
Coast and San Thome fruit usually is produced when 
the trees are from three to four years of age. Dodd 
informs the writer that cocoa trees in Southern Nigeria 
also commence to bear fruit at this age. According to 
a report by the Governor of Fernando Po, fruit is not 
produced in that island until the trees are four or five 
years of age. Trees three and a half years of age produce 
fruit in Samoa and also in Trinidad and Ceylon. 

In Ecuador, cocoa trees do not bear fruit until the 
sixth year, while in Grenada the trees do not commence 
to bear a great crop of fruit until the fifth year. 

Preuss mentions that the Nicaraguan-criollo cocoa 
tree does not commence bearing in Nicaragua until it is 
six years of age, but the same variety produces fruit in 
Ceylon at least two years earlier. 

It is most essential to harvest the fruit at the proper 
time to ensure the beans being correctly fermented and 
cured, and placed on the market in good condition. 
The beans of immature fruits are not properly developed, 
and after being fermented and cured become shrivelled 
and unsightly. Undeveloped beans do not ferment 
readily when placed in the fermenting receptacles, and 
when mixed with well-ripened beans the cured product 
will contain a number of imperfectly fermented, shrivelled 
beans. 

On the other hand, when ripe fruits are allowed to hang 
for too long a time upon the trees fermentation often 
commences in the fruit and the beans germinate. "When 
mixed in the fermenting receptacles with beans of a proper 
degree of ripeness, those which have already been sub- 

114 



CHARACTERS INDICATING RIPENESS IN FRUITS 116 

mitted to a certain amount of fermentation will obviously 
require a shorter further period of fermentation than 
the properly ripened beans. Consequently an uneven 
sample is obtained, and unless very careful grading is 
practised the commercial value of the product will be 
depreciated. 

Characters of Ripe Fruit. Unless very great care is 
exercised by the pickers a certain amount of both over- 
ripe and under-ripe fruits will be harvested. These 
should be sorted out from the bulk and the beans taken 
from them should be fermented separately. 

The external appearance of a properly ripened fruit 
varies considerably in different varieties. In all varieties, 
however, when the fruit is ripe the beans detach them- 
selves in a mass from the fruit- wall, and when the 
latter is rapped smartly a hollow sound is heard ; if 
immature fruits are similarly treated only a dull sound 
is heard. 

The colour of the ripe fruits of different varieties varies 
from a pale canary-yellow to a dark chocolate-red. 

The six varieties of fruits illustrated in Plates 1 and 2 
vary in this manner. Nos. n, in, iv, and v are of 
different shades of yellow, while Nos. I and vi are 
different shades of red. 

When cross-fertilisation has taken place, a tree which 
usually produces fruits of a yellow colour when ripe may 
have some fruits tinged with red. This is another 
important reason why different varieties should be 
separated in the plantation. For example, when several 
varieties which produce fruits all of different shades of 
yellow when ripe are mixed together in the plantation, 
it is inconceivable that the average estate labourer will 
be able to discriminate between them and decide what 
shade of yellow indicates ripeness of the fruit of each 
variety. 

Nor is the method of tapping fruits to ascertain their 
degree of ripeness always practicable or even possible. 
Far too much time would be lost if the pickers were sent 
into the plantations with instructions not to harvest 
fruits which did not give, when tapped, the characteristic 
sound which is indicative of maturity. 

Collection. It is preferable to collect frequently, 
especially during the biggest crop season. This will 



116 HARVESTING AND TRANSPORTING 

tend to obviate the danger of fruits becoming over-ripe 
on the trees, and fruits which have not assumed the 
characteristic hue associated with ripeness may with 
less likelihood of deterioration be left on the trees. 

Extreme care should be exercised in severing the fruits 
from the trees. The cocoa tree produces the greater 
part of its fruits on the trunk and main branches, and 
flowers and fruits may be produced from the same region 
for many consecutive years. 

The first flowers are produced in the neighbourhood 
of a leaf scar ; they may be solitary or in groups. It is 
estimated, however, that less than 1 per cent, of the 
flowers develop into mature fruits, although two, three, 
and even six fruits eventually may develop from one 
group of flowers. 

Six months usually elapse between florescence and the 
maturation of the fruit. 

If a young cocoa tree which is bearing its first crop of 
ripe fruits is examined, it will be observed that the stem 
is slightly swollen at the point where a fruit-stalk is at- 
tached. Should the fruit be separated from the tree 
by cutting through its stalk with a sharp knife, so as to 
leave a piece of the stalk adhering to the stem, a layer 
of cork-tissue subsequently forms at its base, which cuts 
off its connection with the stem and it falls to the ground. 
At the point of separation a slight depression is observed 
in the swelling or cushion on the stem. In Plate 7 can 
be seen sections of fruit-stalks adhering to the trunk, and 
also nicely healed, scar-like depressions from where fruit- 
stalks have fallen. 

The large protuberances shown on the stem in the 
same plate are the result of the swellings formed 
during the production of fruit of several seasons. New 
flowers and fruits also may be seen springing from 
them. 

Let us return to the young fruiting tree. If the ripe 
fruit is carelessly pulled off, part of the cushion-like 
swelling at the base of the fruit-stalk in all probability 
will be removed with it, and the tree's power of producing 
further crops of flowers and fruits from that region will 
be checked. Similarly, when a fruit is torn from an older 
tree, part of the cushion almost invariably is wrenched 
away with it. 



PLATE 7

Fl.OWERS, FRUITS, AND PERENNIAL "FLOWERING CUSHIONS " OF 
THE COCOA THEE 



IMPORTANCE OF CARE IN HARVESTING FRUITS 117 

The labourers frequently climb the trees to collect the 
fruit from the high branches, and by this means cause 
considerable damage to the " flower-cushions." 

The wounds caused by careless picking also afford 
convenient openings for disease infection. 

It will thus be apparent that unless due care be exer- 
cised in reaping cocoa fruits the productive capacity of 
the trees will be appreciably diminished. 

Reaping Implements. All the fruits on the lower part 
of the tree should be severed by means of a sharp knife ; 
those out of reach can be cut by means of variously 
slmped cutting-implements supported on poles of con- 
venient length. There are numerous forms of the latter 
in use ; some are shaped like a small bill-hook, with either 
a sharpened, pointed extension above the hook, or an 
extension with a cutting edge at right angles to the 
handle. Another has its cutting edge in the shape of 
a V. West African natives often emplo3 r a flattened, 
spear-shaped cutter, with which they are particularly 
dexterous. 

Whatever form of cutter be employed it is most im- 
portant that it should be made of first-class material, 
capable of maintaining a keen edge. It is impossible 
to sever properly a cocoa fruit with a blunt instrument, 
whatever its shape may be. 

The main requirements of a cocoa reaping-knife are 
that, (1) it should sever the fruit-stalk without dragging 
or tearing the tissues, and without injury to the " flower- 
cushion " ; (2) it will detach satisfactorily a ripe fruit 
from a bunch of immature ones ; (3) it should be light 
in weight, but at the same time strong, durable, and 
capable of being easily sharpened. 

However well an implement may be adapted for cutting 
the fruit it is certain to prove destructive in the hands 
of a careless operator. The collection of fruit requires 
as much careful supervision as any other operation 
connected with the production of cocoa, for upon its 
proper performance depends, in a large measure, not only 
the quality of the actual crop being harvested, but also the 
quantity of subsequent crops. The quality of the crop 
is affected by the cutting of immature fruits and by 
missing the ripe ones, which become over-ripe by the time 
the next collection takes place. Injuries caused to the 



118 HARVESTING AND TRANSPORTING 

" flower-cushions " by the careless handling of reaping- 
knives must tend to diminish subsequent yields. 

Bean Extraction. On some estates the beans are ex- 
tracted from the fruits in the neighbourhood of the 
collecting grounds, on others the fruits are conveyed to 
the fermenting-houses and the beans are extracted there. 
The latter method has certain advantages in its favour, 
for the beans can be protected better from rain, which 
impairs their fermentative properties, and there is less 
likelihood of their becoming contaminated with foreign 
substances. 

The fruit-shells contain valuable plant-foods, and it is 
advisable to incorporate them in the soil, so that their 
conveyance to the fermenting-house and back to the 
plantation entails unnecessary labour. 

The fruits are usually broken open by hand. On some 
estates a knife is used ; the operator holds the fruit in 
the palm of one hand and the knife in the other, a trans- 
verse cut is made in the shell of the fruit and a sharp jerk 
of the knife-hand splits it open. A certain amount of 
skill is required to prevent the knife injuring the beans. 

On other estates the fruits are beaten with a small, 
heavy club, or the fruit is banged on a hard sub- 
stance until it is sufficiently crushed to be easily opened. 
Usually the beans are extracted by different labourers, as 
one labourer opening the fruits can keep two others em- 
ployed in extracting the beans and separating the stringy 
placentas from them. 

When the fruits are opened in the plantation, frequently 
the beans are placed on banana leaves spread on the 
ground preparatory to being transported to the ferment- 
ing-house. This method is open to objection, as it entails 
unnecessary labour in removing the beans to various 
receptacles before they can be taken to the fermenting- 
house. A better plan is to supply the labourers who 
extract the beans with baskets or some similar article 
in which the beans can be placed as they are extracted 
from the fruit-shells. Suitable baskets for this purpose 
can be made of strips cut from the petiole of various 
palm leaves. 

Beans which have commenced to germinate or have 
been injured by fungus, insect, or animal pests should 
be placed apart and fermented separately. This will 



RISE OF TEMPERATURE IN SHELLED SEEDS 119 

save much labour when the cured beans are being graded 
for market. 

Necessity for Expediting Transport of Beans from the 
Plantation to the Fermenting-House. When the freshly 
extracted beans are bulked, fermentation soon com- 
mences, and especially during hot, damp weather. It is 
therefore necessary to cpnvey them to the fermenting- 
house as soon as possible in order to prevent fermentation 
occurring in the plantation. To enable this to be effected 
the labour force should be so organised that the work of 
collecting the fruits, extracting the beans, and trans- 
porting them to the fermenting-house proceeds unin- 
terruptedly. 

If at the end of the day it is found impossible to place 
all the beans extracted in the fermenting-boxes before the 
next day, these should not be mixed with those extracted 
on the following day, as fermentative changes almost 
invariably will have commenced in them. On one occa- 
sion in San Thome the writer found that the temperature 
of a heap of beans which had been left in the plantation 
for twenty-four hours had risen 7 Fahr. during that 
period. 

The actual records taken were as follows :

At one estate the writer visited in San Thome a fruit - 
breaking machine (manufactured by Masson, New York) 
was in operation. It appeared to be serviceable, but so 
many difficulties were experienced in moving it about 
the plantation that it is extremely doubtful whether it 
will replace hand labour. The manager was of the 
opinion that its cost did not justify its employment. 

Decauville Railways. On large cocoa estates the trans- 
port of the beans to the fermenting-house is extremely 
costly, even when wagons or carts, drawn by horses, 
mules, or bullocks, are employed. 

Aerial ropeways, similar to those used on Ceylon tea 
estates for conveying the freshly plucked leaf to the 



120 HARVESTING AND TRANSPORTING 

factory, would provide a more expeditious and probably 
a more economical method for transporting cocoa beans 
to the fermenting-house than the employment of animal- 
drawn vehicles. 

On several of the large cocoa estates in San Thome 
the cocoa beans are conveyed to the fermenting-house in 
small wagons which run on light Decauville railways. 
The fermenting-house usually is situated at the lowest 
part of the estate, and the rails are so arranged that 
the wagons descend by gravitation. Each wagon is 
supplied with a substantial brake at each end by which 
the speed may be regulated down steep inclines. The 
writer travelled by this means on one of these wagons 
over 40 kilometres (25 miles) of these rails on the " Rio 
do Ouro " estate in San Thome. The rails are placed 
65 cm. (26 in.) apart. The total length of Decauville 
rails, on the " Rio do Ouro " estate, which ramify the 
plantations in all directions, is 102 kilometres (63 miles). 

In addition to these a more substantial line of rails, 
85 cm. (34 in.) wide runs, from the curing-houses to the 
landing stage, on which the cured cocoa is transported 
in wagons drawn by a small locomotive. This line is 
10 kilometres (6J miles) in length. 

A mule is sufficient to draw the empty wagons from 
the fermenting-house to the different parts of the plant- 
ations where the fruit is being harvested. At con- 
venient distances small sheds are placed alongside the 
rails. The floor of these sheds slopes towards the rails, 
and is arranged so that a wooden trough connects it with 
the top of a wagon drawn up alongside. As the cocoa 
beans are extracted from the fruit-shells they are placed 
in baskets. When a basket is filled it is taken to the 
nearest shed and emptied therein. When the shed is 
full a wagon is sent for and the beans are shovelled into 
the wagon through a trap-door opening, situated in the 
front of the shed on a level with the floor. Plate 8 
shows an empty wagon drawn up in front of one of 
these sheds. 

To facilitate the removal of the beans from the wagons 
to the vessels in which they are to be fermented, the 
rails usually run alongside the vessels. Plate 9 shows a 
row of fermenting-cases at the " Rio do Ouro " estate, 
San Thome. Part of the roof of these is movable, and 



ESTATE TRANSPORT IN SAN THOME 121 

the beans are shovelled direct into the cases from the 
wagons shown in the upper part of the plate. 

The type of fermenting-cases in use at the " Agua Ize " 
estate, San Thome, is illustrated in Plate 10. The cases 
are arranged on either side of a large building and the 
wagons are run through the centre. 

At some estates in San Thome the beans are fermented 
in the wagons. 



CHAPTER XIV 

COCOA FERMENTATION 

Effects of Fermentation. The necessity for fermenting 
or sweating cocoa is now generally acknowledged, and it 
is adopted in nearly every country where cocoa is grown. 
The principal objects effected by this process are : (1) 
The removal of the greater portion of the sweet slime or 
parenchymatous tissue in which the beans are enveloped, 
(2) the dissociation of the bean from its testa or seed- 
coat, (3) the strengthening of the testa, (4) the improve- 
ment of the flavour and colour of the kernel. 

The pulpy envelope of the beans is extremely difficult 
to remove before it has been subjected to the fermenta- 
tion process. 

The beans take a much longer time to dry when this 
has not been removed, and are dark and unsightly in 
appearance when dried. The dried pulp has hygroscopic 
properties, and when the beans are exposed to moisture 
it becomes glutinous and is then more liable to fungus 
(mould) attacks. 

The separation of the bean from its testa improves its 
fracture or " break " and facilitates shelling. 

The testas of beans which have been toughened by 
fermentation are less likely to be broken during the drying 
process and also during transport, thus rendering the 
contents less susceptible to mould attacks. 

The astringent and raw, bitter flavour of the fresh 
beans of many varieties of cocoa is due to the tannin 
they contain, which is decreased by fermentation. 
Harrison's analyses of cocoa beans in British Guiana show 
that fresh Calabacillo beans contain 5 per cent, of tannin, 
which is reduced during curing to 3' 61 per cent. 

Action of Oxidising Enzymes. Loew (Porto Rico Experi- 
ment Station Report, 1907) maintains that the change 

122 



ACTION OF OXIDISING ENZYMES 123 

of colour in the bean from white or violet to brown is 
only indirectly effected by fermentation, as the brown 
coloration is due to the work of oxidases or oxidising 
enzymes. These oxidases are stored up in the proto- 
plasm of the bean's cells. When the cells are killed 
without injury to the oxidases, the latter are liberated 
upon the death of the protoplasm and become active. 

If the oxidases are killed by boiling or the application 
of strong acids, the characteristic coloration will not 
take place. Loew describes an experiment which he 
conducted to prove the action of oxidising enzymes on 
cocoa beans. A further control experiment was made, 
in which the pulped cocoa (bean with testa and attached 
slime layer) was boiled for about twenty minutes with 
2 per cent, dilute sulphuric acid. The slimy tissue 
contracted, arid together with the swollen testa was 
easily separated from the bean. These beans showed 
a pure red coloration on the outside, while the interior 
was violet, and no trace of brown colour appeared even 
after many hours' exposure to the air, since the oxidising 
enzyme (oxidase) had been killed, together with the 
living matter (the protoplasm of cells). 

The protoplasm of plant cells dies when they are sub- 
jected to a temperature of 115 Fahr., but a further rise 
of from 40 to 55 Fahr. is necessary to destroy the 
oxidising enzymes. 

Loew further remarks that cocoa beans which have 
been simply sun-dried are uniformly deep brown. 

This statement is, however, not applicable to all classes 
of cocoa. The colour of the beans of the Forastero- 
Amelonado variety generally cultivated by the natives 
in West Africa is distinctly improved by fermentation. 
Those beans which the natives dry in the sun without 
fermentation have a dark blue fracture, whereas properly 
fermented beans of this variety have a typical chocolate 
fracture when dried. Beans of this variety which have 
been insufficiently fermented are also bluish in colour, 
but this is not so pronounced as in the unfermented 
beans . 

The dark blue fracture is objected to by buyers, and 
when it is exhibited in cocoa beans they always realise 
lower prices than properly fermented beans of the same 
type. Even when cocoa is fermented properly the char- 



124 COCOA FERMENTATION 

acteristic brown or chocolate colour is only present in 
the external portions of the bean, and if a bean is cut 
it will be found to have retained its original colour in the 
centre ; complete coloration is not effected until the 
beans have been dried. 

If cocoa beans, freshly taken from their fruit-shells, are 
placed in a heap and the temperature of the mass registered, 
it will usually be found that the temperature of the heap 
will commence to rise in an hour or two, and may continue 
to rise, if the beans be left undisturbed, for seven or eight 
days. At the end of this period there may be a difference 
of 50 Fahr. from the original temperature of the heap. 
The rate at which the temperature will rise and the 
extent of the rise will vary, within certain limits, in 
proportion to the size of the heap, the air temperature, 
and the amount of humidity in the atmosphere. With 
the increase of temperature liquid matter oozes from 
the heap owing to the decomposition of the pulpy envelope 
of the beans. The first exudations have a sweet fruity 
odour, the later a vinous and then an acetic acid odour. 
Provided that the temperature of the heap has not 
exceeded 140 Fahr., the beans will not be injured from 
a commercial standpoint. The sugary pulp will be 
found to have shrunk to a considerable extent and the 
remainder can be easily washed off. The beans have 
now been fermented. 

Yeasts and Bacteria. Preyer (Tropenpflanzer, pp. 
151-173, April 1901), who studied the fermentation of 
cocoa in Ceylon, states that Saccharomyces Theobromce, 
a yeast, produces the best fermentation in Ceylon, and 
mentions that S. cerevisice, and a species similar to S. 
ellipsoides, S. membrancefaciens, as well as a mould, 
Penicillium sp., have been found by him in fermenting 
cocoa in that island. He successfully bred pure cultures 
of the organisms associated with the fermentation of 
cocoa. Lutz found, in addition to S. Theobromce, 
Sterigmatocystis nigra, Pseudo-Absidia vulgaris, and a new 
fungus, Fusarium Theobromce, Lutz. 

Harrison has also investigated this subject in British 
Guiana. He considers that the process of fermentation 
or "sweating" in cocoa consists in an alcoholic fermenta 
tion of the sugars in the pulp of the fruit, accompanied 
by a loss of some of the albuminoid and indeterminate 



FERMENTED AND UNFERMENTED COCOA 125 

nitrogenous constituents of the beans. The albuminoid 
constituents probably are first changed into amides and 
other simpler compounds, which may be further broken 
up during the process of fermentation. Some of the 
carbohydrates, other than sugar, undergo hydrolysis and 
either escape in the runnings from the boxes in the form 
of glucose or undergo, in turn, the alcoholic and acetic 
fermentations. Harrison's results of the analysis of 
fermented and unfermented Forastero (Calabacillo) cocoa 
beans are as follows :

The protoplasm or living matter in the beans is not 
killed during the fermentation process until the tempera- 
ture rises to about 115 Fahr. As this does not usually 
occur until the second or third day, it is possible that the 
action of the living cells is responsible for some of the 
changes effected during fermentation. In regard to these 
changes Loew states : " This would account for the 
decrease of starch, glucose, and hemicelluloses, which may 
be consumed by the respiration process, but the other 
changes are due to several enzymes. A proteolytic 
enzyme brings on the decrease of protein and the corre- 
sponding increase of amido compounds, while oxidising 
enzymes, generally liberated from the protoplasm upon 
its death, cause the decrease of tannin and cocoa red 
and their change to other compounds. The most con- 
spicuous changes are therefore only possible after the 
death of the protoplasm, which is a desirable factor. 

Germination during Fermentation. The same writer 
considers Zipperer's idea, that the changes are brought 
about by the germination process of the beans, to be 
erroneous ; also that the rise of temperature of the 



126 COCOA FERMENTATION 

fermenting pulp cocoa is due to this process, and concludes 
that germination changes are not apparent. This latter 
remark is difficult to understand ; for when fermentation 
progresses slowly at the commencement, germination 
changes undoubtedly do take place in the beans. If 
sections of the beans are made, a pronounced development 
of the radicle is often evident ; and, in the numerous 
fermentation experiments which the writer has conducted 
in the Gold Coast and in San Thome, he has frequently 
observed the radicle protruding through the testa of 
numerous beans in the fermenting-boxes, although traces 
of this nature were not observable when the beans were 
first placed in the boxes. When such cocoa is dried, 
the radicle often becomes separated from the bean, 
leaving a hole by which the weevils of a beetle (Arceocerus 
coffece) and the larvae of a Pyralid moth (Ephestia cautella, 
Wlk.) obtain an entrance to the bean. 

Wright (loc. cit.) states in regard to fermentation : 
" Though the process involves a relatively high tempera- 
ture it is very rare that the latter destroys the embryo 
of the bean ; to a certain extent fermentation is a con- 
tinuation of the processes commenced in the beans after 
maturity. Ordinarily fermented beans, if dried under 
unfavourable conditions, will germinate, the prevention 
of such developments being one of the main objects of 
curing ; this proves that the fermenting of cocoa does not 
involve chemical changes harmful to the vitality of the 
beans." 

The correctness of this statement obviously depends 
upon the definition of ordinarily fermented beans. The 
mild-flavoured beans of Criollo and similar varieties do 
not require such a high temperature during the fermenting 
process as is necessary for the astringent beans of various 
.Forastero types, in order to improve their flavour by 
removal of tannin. 

It is therefore possible to ferment the mild-flavoured 
beans without destroying their vitality; but in order to 
improve the flavour of the astringent beans it is necessary 
to raise the temperature sufficiently high to destroy 
the vitality of the beans before the oxidising enzymes 
responsible for the modification of the bitter principle 
are liberated and able to commence their work. 

Fermentation a Biological Process. Sack (La quinzaine 



AERATION AND FERMENTATION 127 

Coloniale, January 25, 1909) conducted experiments to 
ascertain whether the fermentation of cocoa is due to a 
chemical or a biological process. Seven kilos. (15'4 Ib.) 
of cocoa beans, freshly taken from the fruit-shells, were 
placed in four different baskets. To one of these was 
added formaldehyde and to another chloroform. These 
two substances check the development of the lower 
organisms, but do not affect chemical reactions. 

The cocoa beans in the two untreated baskets fer- 
mented in the usual way, but no fermentative changes 
occurred in the beans treated with formaldehyde and 
chloroform. Upon formaldehyde and chloroform being 
respectively added to the two baskets of fermenting beans, 
the fermentation was stopped and the temperature was 
reduced. 

In order to prove that the presence of air is essential 
in cocoa fermentation, four cylinders were taken and 
4 kilos. (8'8 Ib.) of fresh cocoa beans were placed in each. 
Arrangements were made for the free ingress of air to 
two of the cylinders and the other two were hermetically 
closed. Fermentation took place in the beans in the 
aerated cylinders, but those in the hermetically closed 
cylinders rapidly decomposed. When air was withheld 
from the fermenting beans decomposition rapidly set in. 

The necessity for air in connection with cocoa fer- 
mentation is well demonstrated in practice. Fermenta- 
tion changes are always first manifested in the portions 
of the bean-mass best aerated . \Vhen too large quantities 
of beans are bulked, the beans in the centre of the 
mass will often show no signs of fermentative activity, 
although it may be proceeding satisfactorily in the outer 
portions of the mass. If no proper provision is made 
for the escape of the liquid which oozes from the bean- 
pulp, fermentation is arrested at the bottom of the heap 
and decomposition soon sets in. 

The carbohydrates in the pulpy envelope of the beans 
provides nutrition for the development of numerous 
yeast cells, Saccharomyces spp. These multiply rapidly 
and convert the sugar into alcohol. Nourishment is also 
provided for various bacteria, among them the well-known 
acetic acid bacillus. The pulpy envelope is gradually 
decomposed by the action of the yeasts, and bacteria 
and the juice thus formed drain away. The respiration 



128 



COCOA FERMENTATION 



of these organisms and the fermentative activity generate 
heat and gradually a considerable elevation of tempera- 
ture is reached. 

If the pulp be removed no fermentation of cocoa beans 
takes place, when they are placed in a heap or in a fer- 
mentirig-box ; but if such beans be soaked in a sugar 
solution, fermentative activity is soon set up. The 
fermentation of freshly shelled beans, which have been 
heavily rain- washed in the plantation, is sometimes in- 
duced by planters by the application of saccharine liquids 
or by the admixture of normally fermenting cocoa beans. 

Cured cocoa beans usually possess a slight aromatic 
odour, but the characteristic aroma of cocoa is not 
properly developed until the beans are roasted in the 
process of manufacture. This aroma is associated with 
the fat of the cocoa bean, so that it is possible that 
its development commences with the heat generated in 
the fermenting heap and is further developed during 
the drying process. 

According to Loew only beans in which the oxydising 
enzymes have produced changes can yield the true aroma 
by roasting, not the fresh beans. 

Characters of Beans with White and Purple Cotyledons. 
One of the primary objects of cocoa fermentation is to 
remove the bitter and astringent property of the raw 
beans. The white beans of the Criollo varieties and 
Theobroma pentagona are far less bitter and astringent 
than the purple beans of the Forastero varieties and 
T. sphcerocarpa. This is one of the reasons why the 
former require less fermentation than the latter ; another 
reason is that the integument or seed-coat of the beans 
with white cotyledons is almost invariably thinner than 
that of the beans with purple cotyledons. Wright (loc. cit.) 
gives the following table showing the average proportion- 
ate weights of the integuments and kernels of different 
varieties of 100 cured cocoa beans at Peradeniya :

FACTORS AFFECTING FERMENTING PERIODS 129 

These characters vary in the different varieties which 
produce white beans as well as those which produce 
purple beans ; and may even vary in the same variety 
cultivated in different countries. It is therefore impos- 
sible to state definitely what is the proper period of time 
to ferment the beans of any one variety, especially as 
fermentative activity is largely influenced by climatic 
conditions, the stage of development of the beans under 
treatment, the quantity of beans in the bulk, and the 
aeration of the bulk. 

During hot, moist weather fermentation proceeds far 
more rapidly than during dry, cool weather. Beans 
which would be fully fermented in four days under the 
former conditions would probably take six days under 
the latter conditions. Immature beans take longer to 
ferment than mature beans, while over-ripe beans, which 
have already been subjected to mild fermentation in the 
fruit-shells, obviously do not require so much further 
fermentation as the properly matured beans. 

If unduly large quantities of beans are bulked for 
fermentation without proper provision for aeration, it 
is invariably found that fermentation is not uniform 
throughout the mass. The organisms responsible for 
fermentation require air to enable them to perform their 
work, and if this is withheld decomposition is more likely 
to set in than fermentation. 

In the various experiments conducted by the writer, it 
was observed that a layer of beans about 2 ft. deep gave 
satisfactory results if the beans were placed in receptacles 
made of suitable material, perforated on all sides with 
air holes, and lightly covered with sacking or some similar 
material which is not impervious to air. 

Fermenting-Chambers. Strong, durable wood is well 
adapted for the manufacture of fermenting-chambers, but 
it should be fastened together in such a manner that the 
iron nails or screws used for this purpose do not come 
in contact with the beans. The liquid matters which 
exude from fermenting cocoa beans act upon the metal 
and discolour the beans. The floor of the chamber 
should be either well supplied with holes or should slant 
towards an opening to facilitate the draining away of 
the liquor given off during fermentation, and the floor of 
the chamber should be raised above the ground on wooden 
9 



130 COCOA FERMENTATION 

blocks. If this liquor stagnates at the base of the fer- 
menting-chambers, the integuments of the beans which 
come in contact with it will be discoloured and their 
contents injured. The mustiness common to badly 
fermented cocoa is frequently due to inadequate drainage 
in the fermenting-chambers. The holes should be either 
made sufficiently small to prevent the cocoa beans falling 
through, or, if bigger holes be made, each should be 
covered with a piece of copper gauze. 

Even when fermenting-chambers are well provided with 
air holes fermentation is most active amongst the beans 
which are situated near the sides and top of the chambers. 
To ensure uniform fermentation throughout the mass 
the beans should be daily thoroughly mixed together in 
the chamber or emptied from one chamber to another. 
If the chamber be filled with beans the latter is obviously 
the most practical method of mixing them. When 
large quantities of beans have to be dealt with it would 
be advantageous to arrange the chambers in tiers one 
above the other ; a tier of chambers being allowed for 
each day's fermentation. If the freshly collected beans 
were placed in the highest tier they could be daily moved 
to the next lower tier, and fermentation could be com- 
pleted in the lowest tier. 

It is necessary to keep the fermenting-chambers tho- 
roughly clean, both for the purpose of maintaining them 
in a sanitary condition and to prevent the dirt which 
congregates in them discolouring the cocoa beans. 

An efficient drainage system should be provided below 
the chambers to carry away the drainings from the 
chambers, as these, when allowed to stagnate, produce 
an evil-smelling odour which must be injurious to the 
health of the labourers employed in handling the beans, 
and it is also possible that the cocoa beans may become 
contaminated with the effluvium. 

When treated as suggested above from three to five 
days' fermentation will be generally found sufficient for 
the beans with white cotyledons, but the beans with 
purple cotyledons usually require from five to eight days' 
fermentation. 

Fermentation is usually completed when the pulp is 
readily removed by pressing the beans between the fingers ; 
and a transverse section of the beans shows that the 



REGULATING FERMENTATION TEMPERATURES 131 

convolutions of the cotyledons are well separated, and 
the interstices thus formed are filled with liquid matter. 

If the temperature of the fermenting beans rises above 
140 Fahr. there is a danger of the beans becoming dis- 
coloured and their marketable value depreciated. 

A musty flavour is often associated with over-heated 
cocoa, which also decreases its market value. To avoid 
this a plunging thermometer should be placed in each 
day's collection of beans, and moved with the beans from 
chamber to chamber. If an indication of a rise of tem- 
perature above 140 Fahr. be observed the beans should 
be spread out in the shade for an hour or two and then 
returned to the fermenting-chamber. 

After fermentation is completed the beans should be 
at once removed from the fermenting-chamber, as other- 
wise fungus moulds may attack them and injure their 
flavour. 

The liquid which drains from fermenting cocoa yields 
a serviceable vinegar. Olivieri states that if it is con- 
centrated by evaporation it is converted into a brown 
gluey substance which can be used as a polishing varnish. 



CHAPTER XV 

METHODS OF FERMENTATION 

THE methods adopted in the fermentation of cocoa vary 
considerably in different countries. 

The fermentation of cocoa is by no means a new pro- 
cess. In Aublet's Plantes de la Guiane, which was pub- 
lished in 1775, the method of fermenting the beans of 
Theobroma guianensis, Aubl., is described. 

The beans were thrown into a vessel ; the matter 
surrounding them fermented within twenty-four hours 
and liquid formed. This liquid became acid, and spirit 
could be distilled from it. 

When the germ was killed and the membranes had 
turned brown the beans were taken out of the vessel and 
dried. 

Tropical America. According to Preuss, in parts of 
Venezuela cocoa is only fermented for one day ; the 
beans are then covered with red earth and afterwards 
are spread out in the sun to dry. 

In Nicaragua the beans of the Criollo varieties and 
those of Theobroma pentagona are fermented for only 
two days, while the Forastero varieties are fermented 
for four or even five days. In Salvador and Guatemala, 
cocoa is usually fermented for one or two days. 

Trinidad. Preuss describes the method of fermenta- 
tion in vogue on an estate in Trinidad. The fermenting- 
house contains sixteen compartments, with wooden walls. 
The dimensions of each compartment are approximately 
as follows : 2 metres (6^ ft.) long and 1'5 metres (5 ft.) 
in height and breadth. Between any two compartments 
and along the sides of the compartments a layer of clay 
and grass, about 20 cm. (8 in.) thick, is placed to serve 
a s a non-conductor of heat. Each compartment is fitted 

132 



SIMPLE FERMENTING CHAMBERS 133 

with a lid. The compartments are two-thirds filled with 
cocoa beans, and when these have been well covered up 
with banana leaves the lid is closed. After one or two 
days have elapsed the beans are changed to another box ; 
the same procedure is followed until fermentation is 
completed. The period of fermentation of different 
Forastero varieties is said to vary between eight and 
fourteen days. 

The length of time occupied in fermenting the Criollo 
varieties in Trinidad is said to vary between two and five 
days. 

Jamaica. The following instructions for the fermenta- 
tion of cocoa have been issued to Jamaica planters by the 
Botanical Department in that island (Bulletin, Botanical 
Department, Jamaica, August 1900). "A simple box is 
made 1 ft. deep and varying in length and width accord- 
ing to the quantity of the cocoa ; the contents of 1,000 
fruits requires a box 2 ft. 6 in. long, 2 ft. wide, and 1 ft. 
deep (inside measurements) and Mill fill such a box to a 
depth of 9 in. It must be constructed so that no iron 
nails come in contact with the cocoa to discolour it. 

' The bottom of the box is bored with numerous holes 
and is raised from the ground on two blocks of wood. It 
should be under cover and in a clean place, free from 
dust ; no lid is required. After filling with cocoa it is 
covered with a piece of clean sacking. Each morning 
the whole mass is turned up with the hands, the cccon 
which was at the side and bottom being moved towards 
the centre. If the quantity is small, it is dried on tbo 
fifth day ; if larger (say over 2,000 fruits), on the sixth 
day, i.e. after five full days' ' sweating.' The box should 
be thoroughly washed and dried, and also the sacking, 
before beginning a fresh batch. Thus by a short fermenta- 
tion of a shallow mass, with plentiful access of air, better 
results will be obtained than by keeping the mass closely 
packed together in a deeper vessel. The close packing 
of the mass does not make it hotter ; on the contrary 
the more air that reaches the mass, up to a certain limit , 
the hotter the cocoa will become. It is usually inad- 
visable to ferment for a longer time, but on the other 
hand a shorter time endangers the risk of the cocca 
retaining too much of its bitter flavour." 

India, The coolie dexterously strips all the beans off 



134 METHODS OF FERMENTATION 

the centre pulp. The waste is thrown round the trees 
and acts as manure, while the beans are removed to the 
fermenting cistern. It takes from five to nine days to 
ferment the cocoa properly, and it is then ready for 
washing. As with coffee, it is trampled first with the 
feet and then removed in baskets and carefully hand- 
washed. Watt (Dictionary of the Economic Products of 
India). 

Ceylon. To encourage proper fermentation in this 
country the fresh cocoa beans are either made into piles 
upon the floor or are placed in vessels and covered wilh 
banana leaves or some similar material. 

To prevent the undue rise of temperature in the beans 
and to ensure all the beans being uniformly fermented 
they are turned every day or two. 

The period of fermentation varies in accordance with 
the variety under treatment from two to five days. 
It has already been shown that Crollo and Forastero 
varieties are often found growing mixed together in the 
same plantation in Ceylon. When the beans of there 
different varieties are not separated it is impossible to 
obtain a uniformly fermented product. At the Experi- 
ment Station, Peradeniya, a series of tanks, lined with 
cement, has been made ; on two sides of each tank 
are a large number of holes with an average diameter 
of 7' 3 cm. (3 in.). Through each hole a perforated 
bamboo is pushed, the latter being of such a length as to 
stretch from one side of the tank to the other. By this 
means air can be let into or drawn through the fermenting 
heap, according to requirements. The floor is made 
with a slope to one point, where a perforated sieve is 
placed, to allow the watery products of fermentation to 
escape. 

The writer tried cement tanks as cocoa fermenting 
receptacles in the Gold Coast, but found that the acid 
exudations from the fermenting beans acted upon the 
cement and destroyed the walls and floor. 

Guam. In regard to cocoa fermentation in this country, 
according to Safford (Useful Plants of Guam, U.S. National 
Museum, 1908) : The cocoa beans are sometimes placed 
in jars and allowed to " sweat," or undergo a sort of 
fermentation, which improves their flavour. Some 
growers, after having dried the beans in the sun, keep 



FERMENTING EXPERIMENTS IN GOLD COAST 135 

them until required for use, when they are roasted, 
ground, and made into chocolate. 

Java. Van der Held has published the following 
suggestions relative to cocoa fermentation in Java. 
Preferably, wooden receptacles should be used, which 
can be conveniently covered and placed in situations 
sheltered from the wind. 

Small movable vessels capable of being readily cleaned 
should be employed where only small quantities of 
beans have to be dealt with. On larger estates he advises 
the adoption of the following apparatus : The walls 
of the receptacles should be made of movable boards 
which slide into grooves or supports ; the dimensions of 
each compartment being 2 metres (6| ft.) long by 1 metre 
(3 ft.) broad and deep. The compartments should be 
arranged in rows in the form of an amphitheatre, so that 
if the beans be first placed in the upper row of compart- 
ments they may be readily transferred to a lower tier 
by shifting the movable walls. The bottoms of the 
receptacles should be perforated with holes about \ cm. 
in diameter to allow the liquid which drains from the 
fermenting beans to pass away. 

West Africa. The bulk of the cocoa exported from 
British West Africa was, up to some ten years ago, simply 
dried in the sun. Amelonado is the principal variety 
grown, and its fresh beans have an astringent flavour. 
The sun-dried beans retain their bitterness, the " break" 
is defective, and they are consequently rated at a low 
market value. Cocoa-curing experiments conducted in 
the Gold Coast have shown that the beans of this variety, 
when properly fermented and cured, yield a much superior 
product, and these have been classed by European buyers 
with Ceylon and West Indian cocoas. Samples of cocoa 
prepared during these experiments were awarded medals 
at the Paris Exhibition, 1900, and also at the St. Louis 
Exhibition, 1905. Separate series of experiments were 
carried out with a view to determine the period of fer- 
mentation best adapted to the beans of this variety and 
also the relative advantages attaching to long and short 
periods of fermentation, as well as the advisability of 
washing the beans after fermentation. 

In 1903, three lots of cocoa were prepared as 
follows :

A. E.G. washed. 

This cocoa was shipped to Hamburg for sale, and the 
valuation and reports upon it, prepared by two of the 
principal brokers in that city, are given below : 



REPORT I 
Eight bags are in quality very satisfactory, 

A. 13. (jr. 

and are in exterior appearance, and when cut, very similar 
to the best Cameroon cocoa, and it is to be expected that 
this product will be as good for manufacture. The value 
is about 54 pfennig per \ kilo. (54s. per cwt.). 

A -P n Eight bags are, in spite of the fact that they 
zi.Jt5.ljr. 

have been fermented during six days, too blue in the 
cutting. It would be, therefore, advisable to give this 
specimen a trial and ferment it for nine days. The 
value is about 52 pfennig per \ kilo. (52s. per cwt.). 

A p Three bags. The quality is quite satisfactory, 

A. 13. (jr. 

but as they are fermented only three days, the cut beans 
are too blue. A blue fracture gives a bitter taste, whereas 
a brown fracture gives a sweet taste. The cocoa must 
be fermented six to eight days. The value is about 53 
pfennig per \ kilo. (53s. per cwt.). 

Should it be possible to prepare the cocoa of such a 
light colour as annexed sample, the cocoa would fetch a 
much higher price. Various companies in Africa have 
tried in vain to get such a light colour ; up to now only 
the Bibundi Plantation Company and the Botanic 
Garden at Victoria have succeeded. Such cocoa has a 
probable value of about 57 to 60 pfennig per \ kilo., 
but could, according to our opinion, be sold at such a 
high price only in limited quantities. 



WASHED AND UNWASHED COCOA 137 

REPORT II 
7-^TTT Eight bags, and - three bags. Between 

A._D.(jr. A.-D.br. 

these two species there is no big difference, as the eight 
bags, No. I, are not fermented enough. As through the 
longer fermentation the loss in weight is higher by only 
a small difference in price, the question arises as to 
whether it is not more profitable to ferment the cocoa 
only three days. 

A T n Eight bags. The appearance of this cocoa is 

A. J3.(jr. 

very poor. As this specimen is only an inferior quality 
of cocoa, the value is unfavourably influenced by its bad 
appearance, whereas the appearance of high-grade cocoa 
is of not so great importance. The price difference 
between this and washed cocoa we estimate to be 1 to 
1| pfennig per | kilo. If this small difference in price 
is due to the method of preparation, it is possibly more 
profitable to bring the cocoa on the market unwashed, 
taking the loss in weight into consideration. 

The valuations per \ kilo, of the three specimens are as 
follows : 

I. About 54 pf. = 54s. per cwt. 
II. ,, 52| pf. = 52s. Qd. per cwt. 
III. ,, 53 pf. = 53s. per cwt. 

At the time these valuations were given ordinary fer- 
mented Gold Coast cocoa was valued at 51s. per cwt.

sent at the same time to Messrs. Hamel Smith & Co., 
East and West India Merchants, 112, Fenchurch Street, 
E.G., with a request for expert opinion on them, and the 
following is an extract from the report received : 

The samples were submitted to Messrs. C. M. & C. Wood- 
house, who reported as follows : 

" Sample A. Ripe washed cocoa, well cured, but very 
small beans ; value per cwt. 55s. 

" Sample B. Good greyish-red, not quite bufficieLt]y 
cured, fair size ; value per cwt. 55s." 



138 



METHODS OF FERMENTATION 



Judging from this opinion it would appear that it 
would be more profitable for the grower to send his 
cocoa to market unw r ashed. Extra expenditure is in- 
curred for labour by washing cocoa, and the weight of 
the product is decreased by this operation. 

The Hamburg brokers valued the washed cocoa at 
approximately 4 and 3 per cent, higher than the 
unwashed cocoa similarly fermented, i.e. for six days. 

The opinions of the brokers were contradictory in 
regard to a period of six days' fermentation being suffi- 
cient for this class of cocoa. 

The small difference in the value given to cocoa fer- 
mented during three and six days respectively was 
not sufficient to compensate for the extra loss in weight 
associated with the longer period of fermentation. The 
loss in weight by fermenting for three and six days was 
found to be approximate'y 10 and 17 per cent, respec- 
tively ; that fermented for the longer period was only 
rated at a price about 2 per cent, higher than that given 
to the less fermented cocoa. 

A more comprehensive series of experiments was then

A report from the Imperial Institute has been pub- 
lished (Bulletin of the Imperial Institute, vol. v. [1907], 
pp. 361-9), giving the results of the examination and 
valuation of a number of samples selected from the various 
lots of experimentally cured cocoa, above referred to, as 
well as upon several shipments of cocoa prepared by 
native growers which was made at the instance of the 
Government. The following is the substance of the 
report from the Imperial Institute : 



COCOA FROM THE GOLD COAST 139 

" COCOA FROM THE GOLD COAST 

" A number of samples of cocoa beans were forwarded 
to the Imperial Institute for examination by the Director 
of the Botanical and Agricultural Department of the 
Gold Coast Colony in August 1905. 

" The collection of samples was stated to represent the 
products obtained in a series of experiments conducted 
' in the preparation of cocoa grown in the Botanical 
Gardens at Aburi with a view to ascertaining the most 
satisfactory method to adopt in preparing this product 
for market.' 

" Description of Samples. Seven samples of cocoa beans 
were received. These were described as follows : 

No. I . Fermented 8' 5 days . Washed 

IV a . ,, 4'5 

,, IV6 . ,, 4'5 . Unwashed 

,, Va . ,, 6'5 . Washed 

V6 . ,, 6'5 . Unwashed 

,, Via . ,, 7'5 ,,. Washed 

,, VI6 . ,, 7' 5 . Unwashed 

" All seven samples consist mainly of medium-sized 
beans, but in several a number of small and shrivelled 
beans are included. The colours of the beans are on the 
whole poor, Nos. IVa, IV6, and I being the best in this 
respect. The husked cocoas, in all cases, show a faint 
purple tint and do not ' break ' readily, indicating that 
they are incompletely fermented. This is the case even 
with samples Nos. I and VI, which are described as 
having been fermented for 8' 5 and 7' 5 days respectively. 
As regards the colour and ' break ' of the husked cocoas, 
Nos. IVa and TVb appear to be the best of the seven 
samples, in spite of the fact that they were fermented 
for the shortest period (4* 5 days). Nos. I, IVa, and IV& 
contain a few mouldy beans, and the others a larger 
proportion, in one case nearly 10 per cent, of partially 
perished beans. The flavour and aroma of all the samples 
are mi-d and rather poor when compared with those of 
good West Indian cocoas. 

** Chemical Examination. The samples were analysed in

" The results of the chemical examination show that the 
samples are satisfactory so far as chemical composition 
is concerned. It is of interest to note that the analyses 
indicate that samples Nos. IVa and IV6, in spite of their 
short period of fermentation, have been more thoroughly 
fermented than several of the others ; thus the amount 
of husk in No. IV6, though unwashed, is only 8'0 per 
cent., identical with that found in the washed twin 
sample IVa, indicating that in these two samples practi- 
cally the whole of the pulpy saccharine matter originally 
adherent to the shell had been utilised in maintaining 
the fermentation, so that none was left to be removed 
by the subsequent washing. 

" Commercial Valuation of Samples.* Specimens of all 
seven cocoas were submitted in the first instance to a 
firm of manufacturing confectioners, Mho reported on 
them as follows : 

" ' These samples are considerably better than ordinary 
West African cocoa ; this however is not saying much, 
as this is the lowest grade of cocoa excepting Hayti for 
which there is any considerable market. 

' The writer prefers the flavour of the unwashed 

* Since these valuations were made prices of cocoa beans have risen 
very considerably, so that the figures quoted are only of value for com- 
parison with prices obtainable for standard varieties at the same time, 
viz. medium Ceylon at 46s. to 53s. and San Thome at 50s. to 53s. 
per cwt. 



MANUFACTURERS' OPINIONS 141 

samples in each case. He would say that sample IVb 
is very similar to a mild Grenada, whilst samples V6 and 
VI6 have more of the Trinidad quality. Some of the 
samples show signs of mould, which of course detracts 
from their value.' 

"This firm also offered thefollowinggeneral remarks with 
regard to the condition of the West African cocoa trade : 

" ' The bulk of the cocoa which comes over to the 
European market from West Africa has received hardly 
any fermentation at all. The pods are simply opened 
and the beans dried without any attempt at proper 
fermentation. In our opinion no amount of grading of 
this kind of cocoa would materially improve the price. 
On the other hand, if the cocoa is properly prepared, as 
is done in the Portuguese island of San Thome and in 
the British island of Grenada, a superior quality of cocoa 
would be obtained, and if fermentation is done regularly 
the quality will be uniform.' 

" Samples of the cocoa were also submitted to a firm 
of brokers in London for valuation. They reported on 
them as follows : 

"'Sample No. I. Bold, reddish, even but dark" break" ; 
worth about 50s. to 51s. per cwt. 

" ' Sample No. IVa. Pale reddish, fairly good"break " ; 
worth about 50s. per cwt. 

" ' Sample No. IV6. Pale reddish, apparently washed, 
part lean and small ; worth about 49,9. per cwt. 

" ' Sample No. Va. Dull reddish, fair " break " ; worth 
about 49s. per cwt. 

" ' Sample No. V6. Very dull, dark " break " ; worth 
about 47s. per cwt. 

" ' Sample No. Via. Very dark, dull " break " ; worth 
about 48s. per cwt. 

" ' Sample No. VI6. Very grey and coated, but fair 
" break " ; worth about 48s. per cwt. 

" ' During the past few months [i.e. late in 1905] prices 
of almost all descriptions of cocoa have favoured buyers, 
owing to large crops of Trinidad, Bahia, and African 
sorts, and present values are moderate. Cocoa cured 
and prepared as samples represent would attract attention 
and compete with San Thome and West Indian kinds and 
would fetch good prices here.' 



142 METHODS OF FERMENTATION 

" As most of the West African cocoa which reaches this 
country is imported via Liverpool, it was considered 
advisable to have the samples valued also by a firm of 
brokers in Liverpool. This firm reported as follows: 

" ' Samples Nos. Va, V6, and IV6 we consider good 
cocoas, the value of which to-day would be 42s. to 43s. 
per cwt. ex quay Liverpool, usual terms. 

" ' The other four samples contain defective beans and 
are therefore not quite the same value as the first three. 
They would probably realise 40s. to 41s. per cwt., usual 
terms. The " usual terms " means landing expenses, 
and less 2| per cent, discount, merchants' and brokers' 
commission, etc., all to be paid by importer.' 

"General Conclusions and Recommendations. The fore- 
going results show that these samples of cocoa appear 
to be superior to the ordinary West African cocoa now 
imported into this country, and that if cocoa similar to 
the present set of samples could be regularly exported it 
would probably secure better prices than are now gener- 
ally obtainable for the West African product. 

" These preliminary experiments in the improvement of 
cocoa may therefore be regarded as having given pro- 
mising results, and it is desirable that they should be 
continued. Judging from the results of the present 
examination, it would seem that future progress may 
probably best be made by devoting attention to the mode 
in which the fermentation is carried out, since on this 
the flavour, aroma, and colour of the product will prin- 
cipally depend." 

The further action taken is indicated in another 
report from the Imperial Institute. 

" The information contained in the foregoing report was 
communicated to the authorities in the Gold Coast 
Colony, and it was suggested that small consignments of 
the best quality of cocoa produced by different planters 
should be sent to the United Kingdom for sale, in order 
to obtain trustworthy information regarding the value of 
the better grades of Gold Coast cocoa in the open market. 

" This suggestion was approved by the Governor of the 
Gold Coast, and subsequently information was received 
that it had been decided to ship 20 tons of cocoa, selected 
by the Director of Agriculture and consisting of ' 1 ton 



VALUATIONS OF GOLD COAST COCOA 143 

lots,' from twenty different farmers, for sale in this 
country. It was arranged by the Imperial Institute 
that these consignments of cocoa should be sold at public 
auction in Liverpool. 

"The first consignment, consisting of 114 bags ex 
'Nigeria,' was received by the brokers on January 19, 
1907. 

" The brokers withdrew samples of the different lots 
included in this consignment and furnished the following 
report regarding them : 

' No. 1, 20 bags. Bright, clean beans of fair size 
but not sufficiently fermented ; very saleable quality, 
worth 67s. to 68s. per cwt. 

" 'No. 2, 20 bags. Bright, clean, and sound beans of 
fair size but only partly fermented ; very saleable quality, 
value 68s. per cwt. 

" ' No. 3, 19 bags. Bright, sound beans, on the whole 
fairly well fermented but containing some percentage of 
unfermented beans mixed with small beans ; very sale- 
able quality, value 68s. to 69s. per cwt. 

"'No. 4, 15 bags. Large beans of good quality and 
well fermented. The most desirable lot ; very saleable, 
value 73s. to 75s. per cwt. 

"'No. 5, 13 bags. Sound beans of fair quality but 
mostly unfermented and mixed with small beans ; sale- 
able, value about 66s. per cwt. 

" ' No. 6, 9 bags. Bright beans of fair quality but mixed 
with small and defective beans ; value about 64s. per 
cwt. ; saleable. 

" ' No. 7, 7 bags. Beans of moderate quality and fair 
size ; distinct traces of mouldy beans ; value about 
63s. per cwt. 

"'No. 8, 11 bags. Fair quality, mostly unfermented 
beans mixed with small and thin beans ; value about 
65s. per cwt.' 

" The whole of this consignment was sold at an average 
price of 68s. per cwt. 

"All the parcels were saleable cocoas, but No. 4 was 
specially commended as representing the standard of 
quality which should be aimed at. Such cocoa would 
compete with the better kinds, such as San Thome, where- 
as if only slightly below this in quality, the price realised 
would be from 5s. to 7s. 6d. per cwt. lower. 



144 METHODS OF FERMENTATION 

" The second portion of the consignment consisted of 
60 bags ex ' Akabo,' which were received at Liverpool 
on February 2, 1907. The following opinions of the 
different lots were supplied by the brokers previous to 
the sale : 

"'IV, 5 bags. Good, fair beans of good size mixed 
with slatey beans. Value about 68s. per cwt. 

"'V, 7 bags. Fair quality, mixed with small and 
defective beans. Value about 67s. per cwt. 

" ' VI, 12 bags. Fair quality but small and unfermented. 
Value about 67s. per cwt. 

" 'VII, 13 bags. Fair quality, mixed with small and 
lean beans. Value about 68s. per cwt. 

" ' VIII, 9 bags. Fair quality, mixed with small and 
defective beans. Value about 67s. per cwt. 

" ' IX, 14 bags. Moderate quality very small, badly 
cured, and mixed with defective beans. Value about 
65s. per cwt.' 

" The lots were sold separately and realised the follow- 
ing prices in bond : 

IV. 70s. per cwt. VII. 69s. per cwt. 

V. 68s. VIII. 65s. ,, 

VI. 67s. ,, ,, IX. 65s. ,, 

" The brokers stated that they were rather surprised at 
the high price realised by one or two of the lots, which 
went to a Continental buyer. 

" Samples of the different lots were supplied to several 
English manufacturers, and in certain cases criticisms 
and valuations were obtained, which may be quoted. 

" One firm stated that they could not report favourably 
upon the cocoa, since none of the lots would rank as 
average good Grenada estate cocoa. They added that 
lower grades of cocoa, like the present consignments, are 
often keenly bid for by makers of common chocolate, 
and realise prices which, in their opinion, are much 
higher than the quality justifies. They prefer not to 
buy such cocoas themselves, so long as good estate cocoa 
can be obtained at a reasonable price. In their opinion 
Nos. 2, 3, 4 (ex 'Nigeria') and No. IV (ex 'Akabo') 
appeared to be the best samples ; at the same time they 
considered that better cultivation and more experience 



145 

in fermenting the beans would lead to considerable im- 
provement in the quality of the cocoa. 

" A second firm of manufacturers classified the cocoas, 
as regards commercial value, in five divisions as follows : 

A. . . Nos. 4 and IV. 

B. . . 3 7. 

C. . 1 ,, 2. 

D. 5, 8, V, VI, VII, VIII, and IX. 

E. . . 6. 

< ' '> 

' The Arabic numbers represent the samples ex 
'Nigeria,' the Roman those ex 'Akabo.' 

" They stated that samples 4 and IV alone appeared 
to have had any effective fermentation, and that even 
in these samples it is not quite regular. 

" Conclusions. For comparison with the prices obtained 
for these Gold Coast cocoas the following particulars 
may be quoted regarding the current rates for cocoa in 
Liverpool and London at the time of the sales :

" A comparison of the brokers' valuations of the eight 
lots ex ' Nigeria ' with the Liverpool prices of the same 
date shows that one sample, No. 4, was considered to be 
superior to the best West African cocoa then offered 
on the market. Three other samples, Nos. 1, 2, and 3, 
were valued at a little below the top market price, viz. 
at 66s. to 69s. per cwt., whilst the other four lots were 
valued at from 63s. to 66s. per cwt. at a time when 60s. 
was the lowest market quotation for West African cocoa. 

" Sample No. 4 of this consignment was of very good 
quality and was commended by the manufacturing 
firms consulted. There is no doubt that if cocoa of this 
quality can be regularly prepared in the Gold Coast it 
will realise very good prices in the market. 

"The six lots ex 'Akabo' realised from 65s. to 70s. 
per cwt. compared with the market price of 60s. to 69s. 
per cwt. Only one sample, No. IV, realised 70s. per cwt., 
but three others, Nos. V, VI, and VII, fetched 68s., 67s., 
and 69s. per cwt. respectively ; whilst the other two were 
sold at 65s. per cwt. 

" The principal defect of these Gold Coast cocoas as a 
whole is insufficient fermentation, which considerably 
reduces their market value in comparison with other 
varieties. If the preparation of the cocoa could be 
improved in this respect, much better prices would be 
realised. In addition, the presence of small and mouldy 
beans in many of the samples also reduces their quality 
and value. The occurrence of a considerable proportion 
of small beans is no doubt due to defective methods of 
cultivation, whilst the development of mould in some 
of the cocoas may be attributed to insufficient drying 
after fermentation. Considerable improvement could be 
effected in all these directions, with the result that the 
quality of the cocoa would be greatly enhanced. The 
native farmers should be encouraged to produce cocoa 
similar to sample No. 4 ex ' Nigeria.' ' 

In connection with these results it is interesting to

compare those obtained in a series of experiments 
conducted at the Experiment Station, Peradeniya, 
Ceylon (Wright, loc. cit.).

Nearly the whole of the 14,000 tons of cocoa now being 
annually exported from British West Africa is produced 
by native cultivators. The Agricultural Departments 
in these Colonies have been particularly energetic in 
then- efforts to educate the natives to the importance of 
properly cultivating and fermenting this product. The 
beans of the Forastero-Amelonado variety \\hich they 
cultivate, even when grown and cured under the most 
satisfactory conditions, are of a decidedly inferior quality 
as compared with those of the Criollo varieties produced 
under similar conditions. There is ample evidence that 
the native is beginning to appreciate the advantages 
attaching to the fermentation of cocoa ; and if he has not 
yet succeeded in producing a properly finished article, this 
is not so much due to the apathy so commonly attri- 
buted to him, as to his lack of knowledge of the proper 
methods of cultivating and curing this product. 

His attempts at cocoa fermentation are often of the 
crudest imaginable. In some instances the freshly 
collected beans are merely heaped on mats in the corner 
of a hut and covered up with banana leaves until the 
fermentative processes have sufficiently decomposed 
the pulpy envelope of the beans to enable it to be readily 
washed away. 



148 METHODS OF FERMENTATION 

Some farmers collect various forms of receptacles, 
such as kerosene tins, flour or cement barrels, packing 
cases or baskets, and place the beans in these to ferment. 
With a view to obtaining a more uniformly prepared 
product the beans in a heap or vessel are occasionally 
stirred whilst fermentation is proceeding. The period 
allowed for fermentation to be effected is usually three 
or four days, irrespective of climatic conditions or the 
size of the fermenting heap. The effect which fermenta- 
tion has upon the interior of the beans is not usually con- 
sidered. Some of the more enlightened farmers are, 
however, beginning to appreciate the necessity for modi- 
fying the natural astringency of the cocoa beans and are 
adopting better methods of fermentation. 

San Thom6. It is doubtful whether greater quantities 
of cocoa are handled on any estate in the world than 
on those being dealt with on some of the largest estates 
in San Thome. 

Some of these estates produce more than 2,000 tons of 
cured cocoa per annum : the " Agua Ize " estate exported 
3,000 tons of cured cocoa during the year 1908. For 
such enormous quantities to be properly and expeditiously 
fermented a considerable area of fermenting space is 
obviously required. 

Plate 9 shows a portion of one of the rows of fer- 
mcnting-chambers at the "Rio do Ouro " estate. In 
this row there are thirteen chambers ; each chamber is 
divided into two sections. The back division is 4 metres 
(13 ft.) long and T3 metres (4 - 2 ft.) broad. Owing to the 
slope of the roof the height varies from T25 metres (4'1 ft.) 
to T 5 metres (4' 9 ft.). The front division of each chamber 
is the same length as the back division ; it is I'l metres 
(3'6 ft.) broad and 1'2 metres (3'9 ft.) high. 

The floor and back wall of each division are perforated 
with numerous holes for the purpose of aerating the 
fermenting mass and to allow the liquid matters which 
exude from the fermenting beans to pass readily away. 
This liquid falls into the masonry drain which runs 
under the whole length of the thirteen chambers, from 
which it is conveyed away by a central drain. 

With the exception of the small piece of zinc roofing of 
the front section, the chambers are constructed of sub- 
stantial, durable wood. The roof of the back section 



FERMENTATION AFFECTED BY CLIMATE 149 

moves off on hinges, which enables the cocoa beans to be 
directly shovelled into this section from the trolleys, also 
shown in the plate. Each trolley holds about 1J tons 
of freshly shelled cocoa, and generally three trolley loads 
are placed in each chamber. The roof is then closed. 

During the dry, cool season the beans are left in the 
back section of the chamber for three days, but two days 
are considered sufficient in the hot, rainy season. They 
are then shovelled into the front section of the chamber 
through two sliding trap-doors which communicate 
between the two sections of each chamber. The fact 
that the floor of the back section is on a level with the 
top of the front section considerably facilitates this 
operation. Fermentation is then allowed to continue 
for a period of two and three days in the hot and cool 
season respectively. 

The floor of the front section is 80 cm. (2'6 ft.) above 
the ground. The fermented beans are conveyed away 
to the drying platforms on small trolleys, which run on 
rails, so placed as to bring them alongside the sliding 
doors provided in the front of the chambers. The top 
of the trolley being on a level with the floor enables the 
beans to be expeditiously shovelled from the chamber 
into the trolley. 

Only Forastero varieties of cocoa are cultivated in 
San Thome, and the writer found that the cocoa cured 
by the above described methods was inadequately 
fermented. This no doubt was due to the beans not 
being sufficiently aerated during the fermenting process, 
and to a too restricted period of fermentation. During 
the first stage of fermentation the beans are completely 
closed in. It is extremely doubtful whether sufficient 
air enters by the perforations in the floor and side of the 
chamber to aerate properly a mass of closely packed 
beans 4 ft. wide, 4 ft. deep, and 13 ft. long. 

On several occasions when the beans were being 
transferred from one section to another, after the expira- 
tion of the first period of fermentation, it was observed 
that fermentation had only commenced in the beans 
nearest to the sides and roof of the chamber. In the 
operation of shovelling the beans from one section'P'to 
the other, a r thorough admixture is effected and a more 
uniform fermentation of the whole mass is then very

shortly evident. During the second period of fermenta- 
tion the beans are not covered in, so they receive more 
air, which, being distributed amongst the organisms 
responsible for fermentation while in an active state 
of development, is doubtlessly conducive to better 
fermentation. 

The under-mentioned temperatures were recorded in 
fermenting cocoa beans, during the wet and dry seasons 
respectively, by the manager of this estate :

Plate 10 shows the system of fermenting-chambers in 
use on the " Agua Ize " estate. The chambers are strongly 
built of wood, and in the house in which the photograph 
was taken are arranged in three lines, each line con- 
taining fifteen chambers. Each chamber is 2' 5 metres 
(8'1 ft.) long, 1 metre (3'25 ft.) broad, and 1'6 metres 
(5'2 ft.) high, and is capable of holding about 5 tons of 



FERMENTING CHAMBERS 151 

freshly shelled cocoa. Decauville lines run between the 
rows of fermenting-chambers, and upon these the cars 
containing the cocoa are brought alongside the particular 
chamber it is desired to fill. When the chamber has been 
filled the beans are well covered over with banana leaves. 
The periods of fermentation are similar to those pre- 
viously described as obtaining at the " Rio do Ouro " 
estate. At the expiration of the first period of fermenta- 
tion the beans are shovelled into an adjoining chamber 
left vacant for its reception. Each chamber is raised 
above the ground on wooden blocks, and its floor is 
perforated with holes for the drainage of the liquids 
produced during fermentation. 

At the " Boa Entrada " estate the cocoa is fermented 
in stout wooden boxes 1'2 metres (3'9 ft) square, which 
are placed in an open shed. During cool, dry weather 
the fermenting beans are covered up with banana leaves 
or some similar material, but this is not considered 
necessary during the hot, rainy season. The period of 
fermentation varies in accordance with climatic conditions 
from five to nine days ; in other respects the method 
of fermentation is similar to that just described. 

With a view to correcting the acidity associated with 
the cocoa produced on this estate a special building, 
devised by Schulte, has been erected, in which the cocoa 
is placed before fermentation is completed, and the 
beans subjected to a constant temperature of 54 Cent. 
(130 Fahr.). 

The building consists of two rooms, into which trolleys 
are run on Decauville rails. Each trolley carries five 
perforated wooden trays arranged one above the other. 
The dimensions of the trays are approximately as follows : 
T2 metres x 70 cm. x 15 cm. (3'9x 2'3x '5 ft.). 

The beans are first fermented for two days in the 
ordinary way, then spread out in the sun for six hours, 
after which they are spread thinly on the trays until 
sufficiently dried for export. 

The heat for the building is provided by a flue-pipe 
which runs round it near the floor and is connected with 
a furnace. The manager of the estate informed the 
writer that cocoa prepared by this method realised 
about 500 Reis per arroba (2s. per 33 Ib.) more than 
that prepared in the manner previously described, which 



152 



METHODS OF FERMENTATION 



does not compensate i'or the extra cost of labour and 
apparatus involved. 

Most of the San Thome cocoa plantations contain at 
least six distinct kinds of cocoa. As no care is taken 
either to separate these types in the field or to ferment 
the different types separately, the cured product is 
somewhat mixed in character. 

Experiments were conducted by the writer in San 
Thome with a view to ascertaining the loss in weight sus- 
tained by five of these varieties during fermentation. The 
beans from 100 fruits of each variety were fermented 
for four days, then washed and dried ; they were weighed 
both previous to fermentation and also when cured. The 
results obtained are given below :

CHAPTER XVI 

WASHING AND SUN-DRYING COCOA 

IN properly fermented cocoa beans the white parenchy- 
raatous layer of tissue with which they were originally 
enveloped has considerably decreased in volume, and 
consists of a shrunken, discoloured, uneven mass of slimy 
matter. The beans must now be dried to convert them 
into marketable condition, and this may be done without 
the removal of the slime or after it has been washed away. 

Washing Cocoa. The advisability of removing the slime 
tissue from fermented cocoa beans is often questioned. 
In some cocoa-growing countries it is removed by washing 
the beans in cold water, while in others this is neither 
considered necessary nor advisable. Cocoa beans are 
generally washed in Ceylon, and less generally in Samoa, 
Guatemala, Salvador, and West Africa. The principal 
advantages accruing from washing cocoa beans are : 
(1) they dry more rapidly, (2) contain a higher percentage 
of the substances required by the manufacturer, (3) have 
a cleaner and brighter appearance. 

The most important objections advanced against 
washing cocoa are that extra labour is entailed, and the 
weight of the produce is reduced. Some growers main- 
tain that the integuments of washed beans are more 
brittle than those of unwashed beans, and are therefore 
more liable to be broken. The dried slime has both 
strengthening and elastic properties which undoubtedly 
protect the beans from breakage ; at the same time 
it is more hygroscopic than the washed and dried in- 
teguments, and the beans are therefore more susceptible 
to mould attacks. 

Experiments which were conducted in the Gold Coast 
by the writer, to ascertain the actual loss in weight 

153 



154 



WASHING AND SUN-DRYING COCOA 



sustained by washing cocoa, showed that it amounted 
to 2 per cent, in the beans of the Amelonado variety. 

It was, however, found that beans of the same variety 
grown in San Thome only lost T46 per cent, of their 
weight in the washing process. 

Experiments with different varieties carried out in 
Ceylon, with a similar object in view, gave somewhat 
variable results, the loss being from 2 to 7 per cent. 

Preuss recorded the following results of his investi- 
gations on this subject in Kamerun (variety of cocoa 
not stated) :

The above figures indicate that Kamerun cocoa loses 
about 3' 84 per cent, by being washed. 

Eigen (Der Tropenpftanzer, February 1903) found that 
Kamerun cocoa might lose as much as 6 per cent, by 
this process. 

Advantages and Disadvantages of the Washing Process. 
Similarly fermented samples of washed and unwashed 
cocoa beans were sent by the writer to Hamburg and 
London for valuation. Hamburg cocoa brokers appraised 
the washed samples at from 3 to 4 per cent, higher than 
the unwashed samples. The London broker, however, 
rated both samples at the same value. It would thus 
appear that so far as the cocoa yielded by the Amelonado 
variety in West Africa is concerned a net gain of from 
1 to 2 per cent, is likely to be obtained by washing cocoa 
intended for the Hamburg market, but a loss of 2 per 
cent, might be sustained by washing cocoa for the 
London market. 

With a view to eliciting further information on this 
subject the writer has recently consulted two of the 
largest cocoa-buying firms in Great Britain. One of 



LOSSES ENTAILED BY WASHING COCOA 155 

them states: "Washing cocoa. We believe this to be 
a useless and even to some degree a harmful practice, 
as it makes the shell brittle and less protection to the 
bean, and it is naturally more likely to take up foreign 
scents and to lose its own aroma ; we should not give 
a higher price for cocoa because it was washed." Arid 
further : " We consider the preparation for market of by 
far the largest proportion of Bahia, Trinidad, Grenada, 
San Thome, and Kamerun cocoa is perfectly satisfactory 
to the consumer, and dislike any tampering with the 
bean, as by washing, claying, oiling, etc." The opinion 
of the other cocoa-buying firm consulted is directly con- 
tradictory, i.e. : " We prefer washed cocoa, because in this 
case the shell is more likely to be clean and thinner, and 
therefore there w r ould be less loss of weight when the 
clean bean is finally secured " ; and "In buying cocoa we 
certainly do go into the question of loss of weight by 
moisture and shell and have carefully worked out a table 
of the various cocoas, showing their different losses. In 
many cases the loss through moisture and shell amounts 
to some 25 Ib. and over per cwt." 

It is thus apparent that even in the same market, 
buyers are not in accord on this subject, for while one 
section of buyers favours washed cocoa the other may 
prefer the product unwashed. The grower must there- 
fore decide for himself which method is likely to be the 
more profitable to him. When artificial drying facilities 
are not available he should seriously consider the ad- 
visability of washing his cocoa in view of the more hygro- 
scopic character of unwashed beans and the fact that 
they require a longer drying period. 

As an instance of the advantages accruing from washing 
cocoa the enhanced price which Ceylon washed cocoa 
realises as compared with Trinidad unwashed cocoa is 
sometimes quoted. 

The superior price obtained for the former is, however, 
more due to its containing a greater percentage of cinna- 
mon-coloured kernels, which is a characteristic of the 
beans with white cotyledons when cured. 

The residual slime is usually washed off fermented 
cocoa beans by placing them in a basket under a stream 
of running water and vigorously rubbing them with the 
hand or by trampling upon them with the naked feet. 



156 WASHING AND SUN-DRYING COCOA 

Claying and Polishing Cocoa. The practice of coating fer- 
mented cocoa beans with red earth, brick dust, red ochre, 
and similar substances obtains in Trinidad, Venezuela, and 
in a less degree in several other countries. According 
to Olivieri (loc. cit.) it consists in introducing red, ferru- 
ginous earth, devoid of organic matter, at the rate of to 
| Ib. per barrel (110 Ib.) of wet cocoa. It is reported to 
produce uniformity of colour, to preserve the aroma, and 
to prevent mould. Powdered red earth is used. The 
fermented beans, after being partially dried in the sun, 
are piled in longitudinal heaps on the drying platforms 
and the pulverised earth is sifted over them. It is then 
incorporated with the beans by thoroughly stirring them 
with wooden shovels ; and the earth adheres to the 
mucilaginous matter which remains clinging to the in- 
teguments. They are then spread out in the sun to 
dry. When drying is nearly completed they are piled 
into heaps and lightly sprinkled with water until the whole 
mass becomes sticky. The labourers then trample them 
with their naked feet until the seed-coats assume a 
glossy appearance, when they are again spread out in 
the sun until sufficiently dry for export. Buyers whom 
the writer has consulted were unanimous in objecting 
to the practice of covering the beans with foreign sub- 
stances, in view of the losses sustained in manufacture. 
Bannister (Journal of the Royal Society of Arts, 1890) 
found that the integuments of clayed cocoa beans from 
Trinidad contained as much as 5' 12 per cent, of sand and 
2' 87 per cent, of silica. 

Hart (loc. cit.} offers the following remarks in regard to 
the practice of polishing cocoa with various substances : 
" In Trinidad various mixtures are used for colouring 
purposes and for bringing out the polished appearance 
of the cocoa ; among them may be mentioned, starch, 
red ochre, noucou or annatto, and red earth or clay. 
The red clay of San Antonio estate, Trinidad, is de- 
scribed by J. Bowrey, Government Analyst of Jamaica, 
as a very fine ferruginous clay free from organic matter, 
and it is said to answer the purpose admirably. Dress- 
ing or colouring of cocoa is, however, more practised 
by merchants who purchase from the small growers than 
by the well-to-do planter, as by this means they are able to 
put an even appearance on samples of different qualities ; 



EFFECTS OF DRYING COCOA 157 

but cocoa of finest quality and appearance can be made 
without the addition of any single particle of extraneous 
matter, if the methods of the best estates are adopted." 

Curing or Drying Cocoa. Fermented cocoa beans are 
dried either by exposing them to the sun and air or by 
subjecting them to artificial heat. The latter method 
is becoming yearly more general, especially on large 
estates, where sufficient bright weather does not obtain 
during the principal crop seasons. 

Sun-drying produces a more uniform product and also 
imparts a brighter and more attractive appearance to 
the beans. 

Sun-Drying. The beans which are to be dried by 
natural agencies are spread out thinly in the sun on 
various substances, such as coir-matting, cement floors, 
or on wooden platforms. The beans are frequently 
stirred with wooden rakes to ensure uniform drying. 
During very hot weather the beans are sometimes pro- 
tected from the sun for two or three hours during the 
hottest part of the day to prevent too rapid drying. If 
the moist beans are exposed to too much heat the in- 
tegument of the bean shrivels and assumes a hard, baked 
consistency which is readily fractured. The pale brown 
colour of the integuments of washed cocoa beans is 
gradually altered, during the drying process, to a bright 
reddish brown, and if the moisture be gradually evapor- 
ated, the integument assumes a more pliable character. 
The kernels of white beans change to a light cinnamon- 
brown colour and those of purple beans to a deep choco- 
late-brown colour, if fermenting and drying have been 
properly conducted. Beans which have been well 
fermented and cured crackle when lightly pinched. 

Drying Platforms. Platforms on which cocoa is dried 
are often mounted on small wheels, which enable them 
to run upon rails under the shelter of a roof at night or 
during rainy weather. In some countries the beans are 
spread out to dry upon the floor of a building with a 
movable roof ; the latter is fitted with wheels which 
run on rails, so that it can be expeditiously replaced in 
case of sudden rainfall. 

Plate 11 shows the type of drying platforms which 
have been adopted at the " Rio do Ouro " estate in San 
Thome. Part of the system shown contains four tiers of 



158 WASHING AND SUN-DRYING COCOA 

trays, and the other part only three tiers of trays ; there 
are two trays to each tier. The trays are made of wood 
and measure about 16J ft. long, 13 ft. broad, and are 4 in. 
deep. To facilitate the passage of the labourers engaged 
in turning the beans a platform 10 in. wide has been 
fixed between each row of trays. Underneath the trays, 
wheels are fixed, which run on steel rails leading under- 
neath the floor of large storehouses. At night and 
during wet weather the trays are run under these build- 
ings. The floors of these storehouses are much wider 
than a tier of trays, so that the cocoa spread upon the 
trays is efficiently protected both from rain and dew. 
This method of drying cocoa reduces labour expenses to a 
minimum, and gives excellent results during fine weather, 
but it is defective during continuous wet weather. Many 
of the proprietors of San Thome cocoa estates have 
supplemented their platform drying systems with various 
forms of artificial drying apparatus. 

Where cocoa can be efficiently dried in the sun this 
method is preferable to artificial drying, both on account 
of the superior quality of the product which is obtained 
and the lower expenditure incurred. Hart considers 
that 80 sq. ft. of drying space is sufficient for 1,000 pro- 
ductive trees. Olivieri is of opinion that in Trinidad 
800 sq. ft. of drying space is sufficient for a yearly output 
of from 11,000 to 12,000 Ib. of cured cocoa; or in other 
words, a square foot of drying space is necessary for every 
12 J to 15 Ib. of cured cocca produced annually. 

Grading Cocoa. The most carefully fermented and 
cured cocoa contains discoloured, shrivelled, and broken 
beans, as well as shells, dirt, and other foreign matter. 
It has been previously pointed out that the beans in 
a single fruit vary in size and shape ; it is impossible 
to prevent some beans getting broken during the fer- 
menting and curing processes, and contamination with 
a small proportion of foreign substances invariably 
occurs. If the cured beans were marketed in this con- 
dition the value of those of superior quality would be 
depreciated, as buyers prefer what they term an "even 
grade " of cocoa. 

The discoloured beans should be hand-picked. The 
beans may be graded according to size by hand, or by 
passing them through sieves of different mesh, or through 



PACKING AND STORING COCOA 159 

winnowing machines to which these sieves are attached. 
Winnowing machines grade the beans into different 
sizes and separate the broken beans and foreign matters 
at the same time. 

It is sometimes found sufficient to divide the cured 
beans into two grades, but a division into three grades 
is preferable. 

Packing Cocoa for Export. Cured cocoa is usually 
packed for shipment in sacks ; these should be of good, 
stout material, or losses may occur in transit. 

The mouth of the sack, after being filled, should be 
sewn up with strong cord and not tied ; by this means 
a greater quantity of beans can be placed in a sack and 
there is less danger of the cord working loose and allowing 
the contents to escape. 

The quantity of cocoa contained in a sack varies in 
different countries. 

Where the sacked cocoa is subjected to a great deal of 
handling previous to shipment it is doubtful whether 
it is advisable to place more than 112 Ib. of cocoa in each 
sack ; but where good facilities exist for transporting the 
cocoa to the port of shipment it may be packed in larger 
quantities. 

Storing Cocoa. Previous to storing cocoa the planter 
.should satisfy himself that the beans are perfectly dry, 
as the presence of moisture encourages the growth of 
mould, which imparts an unpleasant flavour to the 
kernels and depreciates their market value. 

If the curing process is unduly prolonged, mould 
appears on the integument, and if not removed, may 
penetrate to the kernel. 

It is often possible to remove a slight attack of mould 
from the exterior of the beans by rubbing them vigorously 
and thoroughly drying them. 

When too much mould has formed for it to be disposed 
of in this manner it is advisable to wash the beans with 
water and to dry them rapidly. 

Cured cocoa beans are sometimes attacked by insects. 
The writer observed two insects destructive to stored 
cocoa in the Gold Coast , i.e. Arceocerus coffece, a small 
beetle, and Epheslia caulella, Wlk., a Pyralid moth. 

It is stated that the same insects are also troublesome 
in cocoa warehouses in England. The larvae of both 



160 WASHING AND SUN-DRYING COCOA 

these insects feed upon the cotyledons, and the integu- 
ments of badly infested beans contain little else but 
their excreta. Pyralid moths have been often observed 
hovering over, and settling upon, cocoa beans which 
have been spread out in the sun to dry. It is probable 
that this moth lays its eggs in or upon the beans at 
this period, and although the beans appear to be quite 
sound when placed in the storehouse, they may be badly 
attacked by larvae shortly afterwards. 

Storehouses which are infested with either Arccocerus 
coffcce or Ephestia cautdla should be frequently cleaned 
out and limewashed, and the cocoa stored in them should 
be constantly examined. 

The larvse in the beans may be destroyed by pouring a 
small quantity of carbon bisulphide upon cotton-wool, or 
some similar absorptive material, and placing this in 
each sack containing larvae-infected beans, and tightly 
closing the sack. About a fifth of a drachm of the 
liquid is usually sufficient to kill all the larvae in a sack 
of cocoa. Owing to its inflammability it is inadvisable 
to bring naked lights in the neighbourhood of the 
vapour of carbon bisulphide. This substance has no 
injurious effect upon cocoa, and its unpleasant odour 
disappears when the beans are exposed to air. The vapour 
of carbon bisulphide appears, however, to have no effect 
on the eggs of the insects ; it is therefore sometimes 
necessary to apply the substance on more than one 
occasion, as, although the first application may destroy 
all the larvae present in the beans, more may develop 
from the unhatched eggs. 



CHAPTER XVII 

YIELD AND EXPENDITURE 

IT is only possible to give very approximate figures in 
regard to the yield of cocoa and the cost of production. 

Not only does the yield of a particular variety of 
cocoa vary considerably in different countries, but it 
may differ in the same country owing to variations in 
the soil, climate, and cultural methods adopted. 

The estimated cost of production in a particular district 
is not necessarily applicable in another, as it is largely 
influenced by the local conditions affecting labour, 
transport, land-tenure, and various other factors. 

YIELD OF COCOA 

The manner in which the production of cocoa has 
been increased in various countries by the judicious appli- 
cation of manures has been already amply demonstrated 
in this work. 

Tropical America. According to H.B.M. Consul at 
Bahia, the average yield in that country is at the rate 
of 2 kilos. (5 Ib.) of cured cocoa per tree, when 625 trees 
are planted per hectare, i.e. 284 trees per acre. He 
considers that higher yields could be obtained by a more 
intelligent care of the trees. On one carefully cultivated 
plantation the yield has been 6 kilos. (13'2 Ib.) per tree, 
while on another estate in the Belmonte district, it was 
as high as 15 kilos. (33 Ib.) per tree. In Nicaragua the 
average yield per tree is estimated at 1 Ib., and Preuss 
considers that a similar yield is obtained in Ecuador. 
Previous to the outbreak of the " Witch-broom " disease 
in Surinam an average yield of 440 Ib. of cocoa per acre 
was obtained, but this subsequently fell to 72' 6 Ib. per 
acre. Jumelle states that on some plantations in Mexico 
from 5 to 8 Ib. of cured cocoa per tree are obtained. 
11 161 



162 



YIELD AND EXPENDITURE 



Ceylon. On the various estates in Ceylon which the 
writer visited in 1902 the average yield varied from 
1 to 4 cwt. per acre. According to Wright, from 250 
to 350 Ib. of cocoa per acre is considered a moderately 
good yield, one of 500 to 900 Ib. and over very good, 
and below 150 Ib. inferior. During the years 1893-1906 
the average yield of cocoa in Ceylon varied between 
T3 cwt. and 2' 7 cwt. per acre. On one estate in the 
Dumbara district an average of 1,026 Ib. per acre is 
reported to have been harvested in 1905. 

At the Experiment Station, Peradeniya, where some 
100 to 116 acres were planted with cocoa, the under- 
mentioned yields have been recorded :

One plot manured with sulphate of ammonia, at the 
rate of 250 Ib. per acre, is estimated to have yielded 
8J cwt. of cured cocoa per acre in 1907, while the un- 
manured plots yielded at the rate of 4 cwt. per acre 
during the same year. 

Java. The Venezuelan-Criollo variety in Java is 
reported to produce '275 Ib., '55 Ib., Tl Ib., T65 Ib. of 
cured cocoa per tree when it is four, five, six, and seven 
years of age respectively ; and when from ten to twenty- 
five years of age, a single tree produces from 1'65 to 2'2 Ib. 
of cocoa. 

West Indies. According to the West Indian Bulletin, 
vol. viii., cocoa trees in Trinidad yield at the rate of 
from 1 to 2 Ib. per tree. In this island the trees are 
planted from 10 to 16 ft. apart, but at an average distance 
of 12 ft. ; 1*4 Ib. per tree is considered a fair yield, but 
more than double this amount is sometimes obtained. 
Olivieri is of opinion that the average yield in Trinidad 
is 600 Ib. per acre, or 2 Ib. per tree ; and in districts 
where the soil is rich 900 Ib. per acre, or 3 Ib. per tree, 
are generally obtained. 

From a tree growing in the Trinidad Botanic Gardens 
15' 75 Ib. of cocoa were harvested in 1907. 



YIELDS IN THE GOLD COAST 



163 



Cocoa trees in Grenada are reported to yield an average 
of 784 Ib. per acre. 

During the years 1905-6 the average yield of cocoa 
per acre in St. Lucia was estimated at 300 Ib. 

It is considered that a highly cultivated estate in 
Tobago, in full bearing, should yield at the rate cf 825 Ib. 
per acre. 

Samoa. Old cocoa plantations in this country yield 
at the rate of 450 Ib. per acre. Vice-Consul Frood men- 
tions one plantation of four-year-old trees which yielded 
750 Ib. per acre. Well-cared-for estates have produced 
as much as 10 cwt. of cured cocoa per acre. 

West Africa. The yields of cocoa harvested from 
trees planted at 15 ft. apart in the Botanic Gardens, 
Aburi, Gold Coast, are as follows :

In native-owned cocoa plantations the yield varies 
from 2 to 5 Ib. per tree. 

The total area of native-owned cocoa plantations in 
the Gold Coast was estimated in 1908 at 70,000 acres. 
During that year 28,545,910 Ib. of cocoa were exported, 
which indicates that the average yield per acre was 408 Ib. 

Dodd informs the writer that cocoa trees commence 
to bear fruit in Southern Nigeria when they are three 
or four years of age, and yield about Ib. of cured cocoa 
per tree. This increases yearly, and at six years of age 
a tree may produce from 2 to 4 Ib. In good soil an 
average yield of 5 Ib. per tree is obtained. 

In the Kamerun the average yield was estimated, in 
1904, at 2'2 Ib. per tree. 

San Thome. Well-managed cocoa estates in San Thome 
yield at the rate of 1,200 kilos, per hectare (1,068 Ib. per 



164 YIELD AND EXPENDITURE 

acre), but where the soil is poor, less than half of this 
amount is recorded. 

The average yield is considered to be approximately 
1,000 kilos, per hectare (890 Ib. per acre). 

COST OF PRODUCING COCOA 

Trinidad. According to Hart, land suitable for cocoa 
cultivation can be obtained from the Trinidad Govern- 
ment at 1 per acre, exclusive of survey and other fees, 
but any particular block of land applied for is subject to 
competition. 

Labourers are paid from 25 to 60 cents, Is. 0%d. to 2s. 6d. 
per day. 

In this island cocoa estates are generally planted on 
what is known as the contract system. The land is 
cleared at the owner's expense and it is then handed 
over to one or more contractors. 

The contractor usually retains possession for about 
five years. During this period he plants the cocoa and 
shade trees, as arranged by contract, drains the land, 
and grows catch crops for his own profit. When the 
estate is taken over by the proprietor, the contractor 
is paid at the rate of Is. or Is. 3d. for each bearing cocoa 
tree, and smaller amounts, in proportion to size, for less 
developed trees. Where shade trees are planted they are 
paid for at the same rate as mature cocoa trees. 

With regard to the cost of clearing new land in Trini- 
dad, Hart considers that the felling and burning off costs 
between 15 and 25 dollars per quarree (19s. 6d. to 32s. 6d. 
per acre). By the contract system a cocoa estate may 
be established at from 12 to 15 per acre, exclusive of 
buildings. The annual working expenses of the estate 
may be calculated at from 3 to 5 per acre. The neces- 
sary buildings for an estate of 300 acres can be erected 
for 200 to 250 ; in this estimate, neither dwelling- 
houses nor artificial drying-chambers are provided for. 
Weeding or cutlassing is usually carried out twice a year, 
and costs about 5s. per acre. 

Picking and drying cost from 5s. to Qs. per cwt. of 
dried cocoa. 

Picking and placing the beans in the fermenting-house 
costs from 3s. d. to 5s. per 110 Ib., but these operations

are sometimes carried out for as low as 2s. Q^d. per 1 10 lb., 
as is shown below. 

Four men @ la. 8d. per day reap sufficient fruits to yield 

6 barrels of beans, i.e. 660 lb.

One man @ la. Sd. to pile into large heaps 
One man to break or cut fruits ( day's work) 
Job work extracting beans, @ 5d. per barrel

Samoa. According to Vice-Consul Frood a sum of 
2,500 is required to start a cocoa plantation in Samoa. 
The cost per acre from the time of clearing the land up 
to the collection of the first crop is estimated at from 
25 to 30. 

West Africa. Chevalier estimates that in French West 
Africa an expenditure of 500,000 francs (20,000) is 
sufficient to supply the necessary buildings and equip- 
ment for an estate of 200 hectares (494 acres) and also 
cover all costs connected with planting this area and 
maintaining it until the trees are four years of age. He 
considers that Irhe returns from this area, together with 
another 20,000, should be sufficient to bring the total 
area planted up to 500 hectares (1,235 acres) within ten 
years from the date operations commenced. 

In a report written by the Governor of Fernando Po 
it is stated that cocoa trees in that island commence to 
bear fruit when they are four years of age. In five years 
the capital invested yields interest, and in seven years 
the whole of the capital is reimbursed. 

At the " Agua Ize" estate, San Thome, it is estimated 
that 3,000 hectares (7,410 acres) have been planted with 
cocoa and various other crops. 

Count Faro (A Ilka de San Thome e Roca Agua Ize} 
states that the annual expenditure on this estate, in- 
cluding the salaries of some fifty European employees, 
is 26,500,000 reis (5,300). 

Tobago. The following remarks and estimates of cost 
of bringing cocoa into bearing in Tobago have been 
extracted from Pamphlet series, No. 41, Tobago, Hints 
to Settlers, issued by the Imperial Department of Agri- 
culture for the West Indies. 



160 YIELD AND EXPENDITURE 

It is estimated that a bag of cocoa (165 Ib.) can be 
produced in Tobago for 1 15s. 

Crown land costs 2 per acre. Labourers are paid 
from lOd. to Is. 2d. per day and women from 6d. to 8d. 
per day. 

Abandoned sugar-cane estates may be cleared, planted, 
drained, and kept clear of weeds during the first year for 
5 per acre ; this sum likewise includes the purchase 
of bananas, cassava, cocoa beans, and nursery. When 
a cocoa estate is established on such lands the total cost 
for eight years is estimated at 12 105. per acre, exclusive 
of superintendence. 

In heavy forest land an expenditure of 7 10s. per 
acre is considered sufficient to fell, clear, plant, drain, and 
keep clear of weeds for the first year, including purchase 
of bananas, cassava, cocoa beans, and nursery. The 
total cost for eight years, in this case, is estimated at 15 
per acre, exclusive of superintendence. 

It is pointed out that the above figures are for actual 
outlay on cultivation alone, and do not allow for ex- 
penditure on road-making or fencing. Cocoa estates 
are frequently established by the contract system, pre- 
viously described. At the expiration of the period cf 
contract the cocoa trees are counted, Is. is paid for each 
full-bearing tree, Qd. for each tree not full bearing, but 
over three years of age, and 3d. each for trees under three 
years of age. 



CHAPTER XVIII 



COMMERCIAL COCOA, ITS MANUFACTURE AND USES 

CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF CURED COCOA BEANS 

WE have seen that cocoa is exported from nearly every 
tropical country on the globe, and the methods employed 
in cultivating and preparing this product for market have 
been described. The chemical constituents of cured 
cocoa beans, from various countries, have been deter- 
mined by several investigators, and the results obtained 
are given for comparison. 

Beckurts (Archiv. der Pharm. ccxxxi., pp. 687-694) 
examined twenty-three trade samples of cocoa beans, 
and found that the amount of fat in different samples 
varied from 42 to 57' 4 per cent., the theobromine from 
'63 to 2'2 percent., the starch from 7'56 to 16'53 per cent., 
and the ash from 2' 2 to 3' 75 per cent. 

The average weight of cured cocoa beans, received from 
different countries, was determined by Ridenour (Amer. 
Jl. Pharm., April 1895, pp. 207-9) by taking the average 
weight of 50 beans of each kind. He obtained the under- 
mentioned figures :

Records obtained by several observers, as compiled 
by Jumelle, La Cacoyer, are given in the table on 
p. 171. 

In connection with these analyses it is important to 
point out that the chemical composition of cocoa may 
be affected by different methods of fermentation. 

Beans of the Forastero-Amelonado variety, grown 
in the Botanic Gardens, Aburi, Gold Coast, were fer- 
mented for different periods. 

Examination at the Imperial Institute of the differently 
fermented beans gave the under-mentioned results 
(Bulletin of the Imperial Institute, Vol. V., No. 4, 1907, 
p, 362) :

As previously mentioned some buyers take into con- 
sideration the proportion of shell present in estimating 
the value of cocoa. 

The proportion of the shells and the mean \veight of 
the beans of different cocoas have been determined 
by Brayning (Journal d' Agriculture Tropicale, p. 31, 
July 1901), as follows :

The varying proportions of particular constituents, 
which different investigators have found in cocoa from 
the same country of origin, are probably due to the 
different methods of cultivation and preparation adopted, 
as well as to the examination of more than one variety of 
beans.

172 COMMERCIAL COCOA 

Fat (Cocoa Butter). A study of the various preceding 
analytical results shows that fat is the predominant 
constituent of cured cocoa beans. It may constitute 
as much as 54*40 per cent., or it may be only present in 
the proportion of 3 6' 81 per cent, of the total weight of 
the product. 

Although cocoa butter is not considered injurious, it is 
generally found unpalatable in large quantity, and its 
partial removal is one of the first processes of manu- 
facture. This substance melts at 84 Fahr. 

Fresh cocoa butter is yellowish-white, but if exposed 
to light, becomes entirely white, and possesses a mild 
cocoa odour and a sweet agreeable taste. Both these 
characters are eliminated by boiling the fat with absolute 
alcohol. When pure it has the peculiar property of not 
becoming rancid, however long it may be kept. 

Its specific gravity varies, in accordance with age, 
from 0'945 to 0'982. It is used in the perfumery, soap, 
and pharmaceutical industries, in which it is especially 
valuable owing to its neutral qualities. In chloroform, 
oil of turpentine, ether, and acetic ether it is very 
soluble. Cocoa butter is sometimes adulterated with a 
mixture of stearine, paraffin, and beef fat. 

Albuminous Matters. The percentage of albuminoid 
substances in cured cocoa beans appears to be fairly 
constant at from 13 to 14 per cent. ; but they have been 
recorded as high as 21' 45 per cent, and as low as 7' 50 
per cent. 

These substances are of a somewhat complex nature ; 
about one half are considered soluble, which is a larger 
proportion than that of the albuminoids of either tea 
or coffee. 

Starch and Sugars. In order of importance by weight 
the starch and sugars rank next to the fat and albu- 
minoids as constituents of cured cocoa beans. Accord- 
ing to the analyses quoted the proportion in which they 
are present varies from 2' 40 to 18'0 per cent, of the 
total weight of the beans. 

The highly nutritive properties of cocoa are due to the 
fat, nitrogenous materials, and starch which it contains. 

Alkaloids. To the alkaloids of cocoa its stimulating 
properties are due. 

Payen's analyses show that cured cocoa kernels may 



COCOA AND CHOCOLATE 173 

contain as much as 4 per cent, of alkaloid, but Zipperer 
only found '32 per cent, of this constituent in cured 
kernels of Port-au-Prince cocoa. 

Theobromine is the principal alkaloid of cocoa, and the 
analyses of different chemists demonstrate that it usually 
constitutes 1'2 per cent, of the kernels. This substance 
is closely allied to theine or caffeine, the alkaloid of tea 
and coffee, and like it is poisonous in large quantities. 
Theobromine has a bitter taste and is sparingly soluble 
in boiling water. 

Harrison's analytical determinations of fresh and 
cured beans of Calabacillo cocoa show that, in addition 
to theobromine, '11 and '03 per cent, of caffeine was 
present in the fresh and cured beans respectively. 



COCOA AND CHOCOLATE MANUFACTURE 

In order to obtain the opinions of buyers of the de- 
scriptions of cocoa most favoured by them, the writer has 
consulted two of the largest manufacturers of cocoa and 
chocolate in Great Britain, and he is indebted to them for 
the following remarks on this subject. 



" Washing Cocoa. We believe this to be a useless and 
even to some degree a harmful practice, as it makes 
the shell brittle and less protection to the bean (seed), and 
the bean is naturally more likely to take up foreign 
scents and to lose its own aroma ; we should not give 
a higher price for cocoa because it was washed. 

" For cocoa and chocolate some different classes of 
cocoas are useful. For cocoa the strong Guayaquil type is 
considerably used, and it would be a satisfaction to us 
to see this type cultivated in other parts of the world 
than in the Republic of Ecuador. (It always brings 
higher prices than Forastero.) For general purposes the 
Forastero types of cocoa are useful, and we should not 
call these common, although they are not of the very 
highest grade. For chocolate a certain amount of the 
lighter Criollo cocoa is used in the highest brands, but as 
it has very little flavour of its own the consumption will 



174 COMMERCIAL COCOA 

always be limited, and we should not recommend the 
extending of this cultivation, although the market price 
is higher. 

" One thing that should be watched very carefully 
by native cultivators is the ripeness of the cocoa. The 
yellow pod (fruit) grown so largely in the Gold Coast is 
ripe when pale yellow, and when golden (when it looks 
fully ripe) is nearly always over-ripe and sprouting; and 
needless to say, cocoa that has already germinated has 
lost some of its best flavour. 

" We consider a certain amount of fermentation 
essential for good cocoas. 

" When cocoa is sufficiently mixed with other in- 
gredients in low-class chocolates, or even in a higher 
class of milk-type chocolate, where the proportion of cocoa 
is small, it is possible to cover up some defects, and for 
this reason the demand for the very cheapest undried 
West African cocoa on the Hamburg market (and to a 
less extent in England) will no doubt continue. It will, 
however, be noted that when markets are lowest the 
difference between the price of good and bad will be 
greater than when markets are at their highest, and 
so it should always pay in the long run to turn out good 
cocoa at the additional expense of careful fermenting 
and drying. 

" We consider the preparation for market of by far the 
largest proportion of Bahia, Trinidad, Grenada, San 
Thome, and Kamerun cocoa is perfectly satisfactory to 
the consumer, and dislike any tampering with the bean 
as by washing, claying, oiling, etc." 



II 

" We do prefer washed cocoa, because in this case 
the shell is more likely to be clean and thinner and there- 
fore there would be less loss of weight when the clean 
nut (seed) is finally secured. 

" Large nuts are of course preferred, because there 
naturally would be less shell than with the smaller beans 
(seeds), and the difference in value might easily run to 
Is. per cwt. 

" We buy both artificially and sun-dried cocoa, often 
without knowing which process has taken place, but we 



175 

imagine that the artificially dried cocoa is more protected 
from variation in the weather. We understand that on 
the more modernised estates artificial drying is largely 
resorted to. 

" We can give you no information as to vacuum- 
dried cocoa. 

" We buy certain kinds of clayed cocoa, but do 
not seek after them on account of the loss in weight 
through the heavy clayed shells. We are alluding to 
cocoas such as clayed Caracas and Puerto Cabello. 

" In buying cocoa we certainly do go into the ques- 
tion of loss of weight by moisture and shell, and have 
carefully worked out a table of the various cocoas showing 
their different losses. In many cases the loss through 
moisture and shell amounts to some 25 Ib. and over 
per cwt." 

The general processes associated with the preparation 
of commercial cocoa products from the cured beans 
consist in : 

(1) Cleaning and grading the beans ; (2) Roasting ; 
(3) Breaking and shelling ; (4) Grinding and fat extrac- 
tion ; and (5) Mixture of ingredients. 

Upon arrival at the factory cocoa beans are cleaned 
and graded, by placing them in barrel-shaped sieves. 
The latter are made to rotate, and dust and other foreign 
matters are carried away in the air-current supplied by 
fans. The beans are separated into three or more 
sizes to ensure uniformity in roasting, since the larger 
beans require a longer period of roasting than smaller 
ones. 

The graded beans are automatically carried into the 
hoppers for the roasting process, when they are subjected 
to a high temperature. At the present day roasting is 
generally performed by high-pressure steam, which is 
more economical and cleaner than fuel. This operation 
improves both the aroma and flavour of the beans, as 
their bitter principle is modified. The starch present 
is changed to dextrin, which is more readily soluble in 
water than starch. 

The roasting facilitates both the shelling and grinding 
processes, as the beans are more easily fractured in the 
dried state.

COMMERCIAL COCOA 

Chemical Composition of Roasted 
Beans. The table on this page 
gives analyses of various kinds 
of roasted cocoa beans (shelled) 
made by Hisch and published by 
Blyth. 

When cool the beans are passed 
through a machine which cracks 
the shells ; and the latter are 
then removed by a winnower. 

We have already seen that the 
shells may comprise from 7'1 to 
13" 4 per cent, of the total weight 
of the cured beans and from 8' 5 
to 15' 5 per cent, of the beans 
after they have been roasted. 
The shells are sometimes ground 
into powder and used as an adul- 
terant of inferior chocolate ; or 
they may be employed as manure 
or cattle food. 

The shelled and roasted kernels 
are now ground into a paste be- 
tween heated rollers, which cause 
the fat to melt and a large propor- 
tion of it is run into moulds and 
allowed to cool and solidify. In 
this condition the fat or cocoa- 
butter is often stored, since there 
is no danger of its becoming rancid. 
When the grinding process is 
nearing completion, various in- 
gredients are incorporated in the 
paste with a view to improving 
both its flavour and solubility. 

The flavouring agents added 
generally consist of vanilla, vola- 
tile oils, and various spices, 
while starchy matters and sugars 
are employed to improve its 
miscibility. 

Strictly speaking, manufactured 
cocoa is not soluble in the form 



COCOA AND CHOCOLATE 177 

in which it is drunk as a beverage, but is only completely 
mixed with the fluids, such as hot milk and water, with 
which it is prepared. 

In this respect it differs from tea and coffee, as it is 
the infusion from these two substances which provides 
the beverage, whereas with cocoa the whole of the sub- 
stance, after being thoroughly mixed with liquid, is 
consumed. 

In the preparation of chocolate a larger proportion of 
the fatty matter is allowed to remain ; and if sweet choco- 
late be required, a considerable quantity of sugary 
substances, as well as various flavouring materials, are 
added to the paste formed in the grinding process. 

In Canada the following draft proposals for Food 
Standards in regard to cocoa and chocolate have been 
published. 

COCOA AND COCOA PRODUCTS 

" Cocoa nibs, cracked cocoa, is the roasted, broken cacao 
bean freed from its shell or husk. 

" Chocolate, plain chocolate, bitter chocolate, chocolate 
liquor, bitter chocolate coatings, is the solid or plastic 
mass obtained by grinding cocoa nibs without the re- 
moval of fat or other constituents except the germ, and 
contains not more than three (3) per cent, of ash insoluble 
in water, three and fifty -hundredths (3'50) per cent, of 
crude fibre, and nine (9) per cent, of starch, and not less 
than forty-five (45) per cent, of cocoa fat. 

" Sweet chocolate, sweet chocolate coatings, is chocolate 
mixed with sugar (sucrose), with or without the addition 
of cocoa butter, spices, or other flavouring materials, and 
contains in the sugar-and-fat-free residue no higher per- 
centage of either ash, fibre, or starch than is found in 
the sugar-and-fat-free residue of chocolate. 

" Cocoa, powdered cocoa, is cocoa nibs, with or without 
the germ, deprived of a portion of its fat, and finely 
pulverised, and contains percentages of ash, crude fibre, 
and starch corresponding to those in chocolate after 
correction for fat removed. 

" Sweet cocoa, sweetened cocoa, is cocoa mixed with 
sugar (sucrose), and contains not more than sixty (60) 
per cent, of sugar (sucrose), and in the sugar-and-fat-free 
12 



178 COMMERCIAL COCOA 

residue no higher percentage of either ash, crude fibre, 
or starch than is found in the sugar-and-fat-free residue 
of chocolate." 

The principal substances employed in the adulteration 
of cocoa are : 

Venetian red, sugar, starches, peroxide of iron, and 
brick-dust. 

Chocolate is adulterated with cocoa oil, beef and 
mutton fat, starches and oil of almonds. 

Blyth says : " By a simple estimation of the fat and the 
chief constituents of the ash, supplemented by the use 
of the microscope, all known adulterations can be de- 
tected."
