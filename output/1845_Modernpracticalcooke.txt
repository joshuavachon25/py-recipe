is called the haslet, and is mixed with sage, and 
sweet herbs, pepper, salt, and spice, theii rolled 
up in the caul, and roasted ; there are what is 
called the chitterlings, or the guts, which .are

The fore quarter is the fore loin and sprmg; if 
a large hog, cut a spare rib oS; the hind quarter 
is the leg and loin. 

AJUirge Bacon Hog. — This is cut a di£[jerent 
way for making hams, bacon, and pickled pork. 
Here you take out the spare ribs, chines, and 
griskins, and you have ht for hog's lard. The 
Uver and craw make a fine fry ; the feet and ears 
are both equally good soused. 

Pork comes in season in August, and holds 
good till April.

HOW TO CHOOSE BUTCHER MEAT. 

To choose Beefi — If it be ox beef, it will have 
an open grain ; if young, a tender uid oily smooth- 
ness; if rough and spongy, it is old, or inclining 
to be so : except the neck, brisket, and such parts 
as are fibrous, which in the meat will be rougher 
than in other parts, a pleasing camatioii colour 
betokens good meat; the suet <^ a yellowish 
white, not so good, but ptherwise it is good. 

Cow beef is less bound, and closer graiBed 
than the ox, the &t whiter, and the lean palen

Cock or Hen Turkey^ and Turkey PoulU. -^If 
the cock be young, his legs are black and smooth, 
and his spurs short ;' if stale, his eyes are supk in 
his head, and the feet dry; if new, the eyes are 
lively, and the feet limber ; observe the same by 
the hen, and if with egg, she has a soft open 
vent, if not, a hard, close vent : turkey poults are 
known the same way, , and their age cannot 
deceive you. 

Cock, Hen, PuUet, ffc. — If young, his spurs 
are short fuad dubbed; but you must take care 
that the poulterer do not deceive you in paring 
and scraping them ; if old, he has an open vent ; 
if new killed, a close and hard vent ; and the same 
observations for a hen. 

Tame or Wild Geese, ■ — If thtf bill be yellowish 
and but few hairs, she is youing; but if fuU of 
hairs, and the bill aiid feet red, she is old ; if new 
killed, limber footed ; if stale, cby footed; and 
die same of a wild goose. > , 

WUdand Tame Ducks,— l^e duck, when &t, 
is hard and thick on tlie breast ; but if not, sharp 
oki the breast; if new killed, limber footed; if 
stale, dry footed. A true wild duck has a reddish 
foot, and smalle;r than the taine duck. 

Pheasant Cock and Hen. — T|ie cock, when 
youAg, has short dubbed spurs, when old, sharp 
small spurs; if new killed^ a fast vent; if ol^ a

Praumsy ShrimpSy and Crab ^A.— The two 
first, if stale, are limber, and cast a kind of slimy

wlten it lias done making a noise, it is ready for 
frying fish, fritters, or any thing that requires a 
large quantity of dripping. When you fry fish,^ 
wipe with a cloth, dip them in the yolks of eggs» 
and then in bread crumbs and minced parsley; 
put them into the stewpan, and fry them of a 
nice brown ; lift them out with a fish trowel, and 
lay them on the back of a searce to drain and 
keep warm till you have done them f^; if ®ggi 
are scarce, dip them in melted butter, and then in 
crumbs of bread, but eggs are to be preferred ; 
as soon as you have done frying^ stmin the 
dripping through the searce the fish was drained 
on into a can, and set it by, —it will % fish twic^ 
after ; but, if you neglect to strain it, as soon as 
you set it on the fire, it will bum, and be useleaai 
never fry any thing else in the dripping yoa 
have fried fish in, but keep it for fish alone. -.

OBSERVATIONS ON ROASTIN& FOWLS. 

When you roast a goose, turkey, or any kind 
of fowl, take care to singe them with white p%per, 
and baste them with butter : and, when the smoke 
begins to draw to the fire, and they look plump, 
baste again with butter, and dredge them with a 
little flour, and take" them up while the froth is 
on them. 



GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR BOILING. 

To Wl sorts of boilii% meats allow a quarter of 
an hour to each pound ; and be sure to skhn it well 
just before it comes to boil ; for aU meats will 
have a scum ; and, if that is allowed to boil down, 
it will make the meat black ; and when you are 
making broth, frequently lift off the cover and 
wipe the inside of it, for the drop from it is very

and a half after it cbmes to the boil ; when done, 
before taking off /the string, take out the iron 
skeWfer, and entey a' silver one in its place, then 
take off the striiig, and trim a thin slice of the. 
top before sending it up. 

TO BOIL A LEG (gIGOt) OF MUTTON. 

Put it on|/With cold water, but first tie it in 
a cloth ; let it boil slowly for two hours and a half 
after it comes to the boil; when ready to serve, 
dish, and have a caper sauce ready ; pour some 
into the dish, the rest in a sauceboat. 

\ TO BOIL A HAM. 

When you boil a ham, put it into a copper or 
large pot, that will hold it easy, with cold water ; 
let it be about two hours at the cool side of the fire, 
before it comes to the boil, till it is well warmed 
through; then stir up the fire, and bring it to 
the bpil. ^If it is a small one/ it will take an homr 
and a half ; if a middle sized one^ two hours; if 
a large one, two hours and a half, after the water 
begins to boil, as you must consider the time it 
has been heating in the water, which softens it 
and makes it boil the sooner. Observe, always, 
before you put the hdm into the copper, to take 
a coarse kitchen cloth, with some warm water, 
. and wash the ham well, to take off the straws and 
clamminess from it, and you will find it willlook a 
great deal nicer; and when you come to dish it

for table, take off <the skin, and take" the raspings 
off the crust of a loaf and shake all over it ; set 
it before the fire to brown, and turn it till all sides 
are brown alike ; and send it to table, sticking 
a few cloves about it.-*^ Some people pour a 
glass of brandy over it, and a little white su^r, 
before you put the raspings on ; but that you 
may do as you choose.

TO BOIL PICKLED PORK. 

Put it on when the; m^ter is cold ; if a larg^e 
piece, it will take tw6 hours ; if a middling, an 
hour and a half, or an hour, according to its 
thickness ; if you boil pickled pork too much, it 
will go to a jelly, and not eat well. 

TO BOIL A TONCa^^ ' \ 

If it hto been long in salt,7put it in the pot 
over night, and set it at the side of the fire ; but 
do not let it boiVtill about three hours before 
dinner is ordered, and then bring it to the boil, 
and let it boil all that time ; you will find this 
method makes the tongue swell, (this is for a dry 
tongue ;) but if frosh out of the pickle, two hours 
will boil it; and put it in when the water is cold.

then put a bit of butter in a stewpan, dredge in a 
littl^our, let it froth up ; then put in the gravy 
you had just strained, let it boil a few minutes, 
^d a little minced parsley ; or, if you have 
oysters, you may put them in, in place of the 
parsley. If you have sausages in the house, fry 
some of a nice brown, and lay them round the 
turkey; garnished witJi sliced lemon.

boil them till tender; take them up and throw 
them into a cullender to drain, then chop them on 
a clean mincing board, and put them in a clean 
stewpan ; shake a very little flour over them ; put 
in a little cream, a piece of butter, and a little 
salt; give them a toss over, the fire, and, when t|ie 
butter is melted, it is ready. Pour it dver tbfe 
rabbits or ducks, and serve it up.

hour, as all sauces are enriched by boiling, and 
come to their proper flavour. This answers for 
all brown sauces, and is much better than taking 
browned butter, as, by this direction, the sauce 
will be free from grease. You may add truffles 
and morels, mushrooms, or oysters, i^you think 
proper, according to what you are drying. 

TO STEW A ROUND OF BEEF, WITH A RICH

then wrap the flap tight round, skewer it weD, 
and tie it tight round with a tape ; then rub it all 
over with a little thyme, parsley, and minced

it will be ready f6r use about the ^me time as

The beit way to ke€|)\neat hot, tf.it be < one 
before the company comes, is to dish the njeat, 
and set it on a pan of boiling waterj cover the 
meat with a deep cover, so as not to touch the 
meat, and throw a cloth^ ovct all. Thus you may 
keep the meat hot a long time, and it is better 
than over-roasting and spoiling it ; for the steam 
of the water keeps it hot, and does not draw out 
.the gravy, or dry it up; whereas, if you. set it 
on a carron plate, or even before the fire, it will 
dry up all the gravy, and spoil it- 

'■-^— ■ .;.:.■ V. BEEF LOAF. -■ .'Vy '"■.,--■ 

Take a piece of roast beef, fiit and lean: if 
you have no roast beef, parboil a tender piece of: 
fresh beef J mince it as small as possible: season* 
with beat pepper, salt, 9 small quantity of oni«tt 
minced sinall, a little sweet herbs j moisten it 
with a teacupful of good soup; mix in a raw 
egg, Butter% pudding-pan, and press it in; 
then, if you have a steam, put it in, wid Jet it 
remain tiU you are sure it is hot thiiough ; or you 
I may lay some green blades in the bbttom of water, 
land set it on them; cover it with a pliatef, and 
put the cover of Ae pan over all ; this will 
[answer as a steam, and prevent i^e water from 
[getting into it ; tl^n turn it out on the dish you

TO POT TOMATA8. 

Gather the tomatas when quite ripe, and pey^ 
fectly dry ; scald them in waier for the purpose 
of taking off the skin, mash the gulp, and put it 
into a stewpan-over a very genikle fire, for fifteen 
or twenly minutes ; when cold, put the pulp into 
small stone pots, and after pres8ing^own,.|)our 
over the surface some melted mutton favWea 
piece of wet bladder over the pots, to/keep out the 
air ; the smaller the pots the het^x^ as the pulp 
is apt to spoil after being opened; it will kdep

set on the fire and boil it ; skim it well as it riset ; 
put it into a clean tub ; and when it is about 
blood warm, toast a piece of bread well on both 
sides; dip it in good thick yeast (barm;) throw 
It in, and let it work for twenty-four hours | hare a 
casl^ clean and sweet, placed near the kitchen fire, 
in such a siCilktion as not tgube moved or diaken$ 
fill the cask ; lay a piece of cloth on the biuu^ 
hole, and a |Hece of slate on that to keep out the^ 
dpst : make it in August, and it will be fit for 
using in June following ; draw it off into botiles» 
and filter the groun£. For pickles use^s 
vinegar in preference to any, or, for therl£Ue

CHAPTER XXL 



BREWING AND BAKUfG. 



WATEft'BEST FOR BREWING. 

Water from a river or pond is best, bfeing 
goft ; hard water is not proper for brewing ; rain 
water is to be cbosen next to river water, though 
all water which will nuse a lather with soap may * 
bf mfely used in brewing* 

TO CHOOSE GOOD malt: >■': 

Malt is chosen by its sweet smell, jnello# 
tart«, plump body, aM thin skin. There lore two 
sorts in use, the pale, and the higb or brown 
j^M^', the former of which is mostly used in 
private femilies. In grinding, see that the xnill 
be free from dust, which it is very apt to eollpot 
when not constantly in use, and take eard tiiat k 
10 it so «i te ar|i||ili the grain without grindkig it

proper state for mashing, which you may begin 
to do immediately, stirring it all the while you 
are putting the malt in ; of which keep out about 
half a bushel (half a firlot) dry, to strew overjjhe 
rest, when you have done stirring,— which will be 
as soon as you have well mixed it with the liquor, 
—and prevent it from clotting. After the dry 
malt is spread over, cover the mash tub with the 
malt sacks or cloths, that you may lose none of 
the spirit, and let it stand fully an hour. In the 
mean time, get another copper of liquor hot, and 
in an hour and a haJf begin to let off the first 
wort into the under back ; then receive a pail of 
the first running, and throw it again upon the 
malt ; ybu will find fliat the malt has sucked up 
one-fourth of the first copper of liquor ; it will 
therefore be necessary, to make up the quantity 
of wort for the strong ale, to add as much of the 
seccmd copper, throwing it by bowlfuls over the 
malt, and giving it time to soak through, keeping 
it ail the tame running by an easy stream, till you 
perceive you have about twenty-two gallons ; 
irhich, in boiling and working, will be reduced 
/to eighteen gallons. If, while you are letting it 
off, you throw into the under back'about half a 
pound of hops, it will preserve it from what is 
called foxing, growing sour, or becoming ropy. 
The first wort being all run off^ you itoust fasten 
the ti^) ofvthe mash tub, and take the second

first; then cover it close for an hdur and« half; 
put likewise the same quantity of hops In the 
under baok as yoi^ did for the first liquor. But 
if you intend to make nine gallons of small beeri 
which can be done, though straining the point 
rather too far, one hour will be sufficient for the 
second mash to remain on the malt ; biit the third 
will require an hour and 2 half; and, as it nuMk 
off, you must riBpeat it the seconcTtime, and it 
will be good small beer: meanwhile fill the 
copper with the first wort, and boil it very briskly, 
with another half pound of hops, taking. g|^t 
care to avoid the extremes of under or 'S^ 
boiling, as either of them will materially ii^re 
the ale ; for, if not boiled enough, the liquor will 
taste raw, sweet, and si6kly, and cannot retain 
the virtue of the malt, nor be wholesome drink; 
on the other hand, if it is suffered to boil too l^pig, 
it will thicken, and be prevented from ever be^g 
fine in the cask, or agreeable to the pakte. The 
breaking or curdling of the wort should be yAlr 
guide ; for, if you boil the wort an hour ( which 
is the usual time,) and should take it out of t^e 
copper before it be broke or curdled, 

>^i8managed; but wheii it has^iled^

DIRBCTIONSI RESPECTING TI|E DAIRY. 



I po not intend to treat upon this Subject on a 
large scale, but to confine myself <fco su^ct in^truq- 
tions as may prove useful to those pepons who 
keep a few cows merely for the Wipply of 
their oifh&milies. Illkny ladies or th^ir hoi^* 
s^epe^ Aolmve not, wd do not wish td acquire, 
a ll^o^ou^ knowledge /of the management of a 
dair^^ may, through die medium of thi§ publica- 
tion, attwfi^^ the knowledge that is neiiessarjr for 
their purpoge.^^ \ 

In the firdt placVparticular attention ought to 
be paid to keeping theNlaiiy very c^lean, and, in 
the summer, as cool as possflWej and if any milk 
or cream should be spilt, not to^^^er it tp lie, 
but immediately to clean it up, or it^wlU s*^ur, 
and do more mischief than you are awai^o^ 
Great attention should be paid to scalding

hold the whole, which should be strained into itJ 
\ and there remain about half an hour, frequently 
stirring it until the froth is settled, and the miS

not too deep ; for, if the milk is put warm into

Milk should not stand more than twenty-fojur 
hours in summer, iu winter it may stand double 
that time; after skimming it, pHt it into clean 
earthe^ pots, and keep it in as cool a place as

TO MAKE NEW-MILK CHEESE. 

' As soon, as the milk comes from the cows, 

strain it into a clean tub for the purpose, put as^ 

much rennet as wiU turn it ; when it is sufficiently 

come, stiHie it with the skimming-dish croe^ and 

cross, to make the whey separate, press it dbwn, 

and Uft the whey off it ; lay the cheese-cloth >i 

the vat, and set it on the ladder across the tub 

lift the curd, and press it well into the cheese-vat; 

as it sinks, press more into it, until full ; it should 

be brought two inches above the edge of the vat ; 

bring the doth neatly over it, keeping the curd 

from spreading over the edge as much as you 

can ; set it in the press, lay a board over It ; m 

an hour take it out, change the cloth, return 

it again to the press ; repeat this every two hoijrs 

ibrlhree times ; the last time let it remain, so as 

to be in the press twenty^four hours f take it out 

and rub it all over wfth salt, lay it on a board ; 

do so every night and morning, tumbg it every 

^me, and rubbing it with a clean coarse doth, 

until it is quite d^ : it should be kept in a dry 

airy place. J ^ 

ANOTHER W4Y. * 

Turn the milk as before ^^irected; when the 
curd is coWe, stir it round, let it stand for a littlej 
then presTit doiwi, take off all the whey, have 
a cheese-bag ready, lift the curd into it, put the

cheese-ladder over the tub, lay the bag on it, and 
press the whey out of it, breaking the curd well 
with your hand &om time to time, to make it part 
with the whey; after all is pressed, pour the 
whey out of the tub, put the curd into it, and 
break it well, with as much salt as you think 
sufficient for the quantity of curd ; lay the cheese- 
vat on the cheese-ladder, the cheese-cloth over 
it; put in the curd, pressing it in from time to 
time until it is full, squeezing all the whey out 
of it you can ; it should be left about two inches 
above the edge of the cheese-vat, bring the cloth 
neatly over, put it into the press, observing the 
same rules as in the former directionsi / 






TO MAKE CREAM CHEESE. A 

Take the cream off from milk that has 0tood 
twelve hours, take som6 new milk, warm iti and 
f>ut it to the cream, so as to make the wh^le of 
the same heat as milk from the cow; put Rennet* 
sufficient .to turn it; press the curd verV care- 
fully down, biit endeavour to break it as tittle as 
possible, take off all the whey; if you /wish to 
have it round, or any other shape, put,|| in^ 
doth, and form it as such ; or as a pine .^pplej^ 
odier form ; hang it upon d hook for two or threl^^ 
hours before it is moved, as it is apt to cnjpk 
when the cloth is too soon changed : after it has 
hung the time directed, change the cloth, and 
put it into a net, tying it tight at ihe'top, so as

THE DAIRY, 



tt ' 






to take the impression of the net; let it hang 
until it stops dripping, then rub it with salt, as 
mentioned in the preceding receipts. 

ANOTHER WAY. '^ 

Take some good thick cream, set it intp a pan 
of warm water, until a thorough heat has pene- 
trated it, observing that it must not be so hot 
as new milk; put a small quantity of rennet 
to it, take it out of the warm water when you 
observe that it is firm, wet a cloth, and spread 
it into a small scarce, po^ in the cream, set the 
searoe over something, that the whey may drain 
from it ; when dry, take it from the scarce, put 
dock leaves round it, and lay it between two 
boards, turning it every day, changing the leaves 
each time, untS it is quite dry ; then cover it with 
fresh dock leaves or nettles, and put it between 
two plates to ripen ; it*mu8t be made little more 
tlum an inch thick. 

Note. — Skim milk cheeses ve generally made 
the same way as the n6w milk cheese, only the 
* skim milk must be warmed to the heat of new 
^^Ailk. __
