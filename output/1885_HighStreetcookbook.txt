What the People Think of Hood's 
Sarsaparilla. 



When the first edition of Hood's Cook 
Book was published, in 1877, referring 
to public sentiment, we advisedly used 
the following language : "We are aware 
that there is a justifiable distrust of reme- 
dies put up in patent medicine style? 
owing to the worthlessness of a large 
majority of such medicines." And we 
further stated, by way of explanation, 
that "Frequent calls over our counter for 
a reliable blood purifier, alterative and 
tonic, was the motive power which set 
us to work to compound an article which 
we could use in our own family, among 
our friends, and conscientiously advise 
our customers to use whom we meet face 
to face." 

WE ARE GLAD TO STATE 

That the prejudice to which we referred 
lias gradually given way, and the current 
of public opinion has been changed 
from one of doubt to implicit confidence 
in Hood's Sarsaparilla by our honest 
methods in advertising, our care to pub- 
lish only truthful statements, and by 
our constant care to purchase only the 
choicest of roots, barks and other articles 
entering into this medicine. Hood's Sar- 
saparilla received its first commenda- 
tions from our neighbors and citizens of 
Lowell. Their good words were such as 
to make calls for it in the neighboring 
cities and towns ; and thus, from a small 
beginning, the circuit of demand for 

HOODS SARSAPARILLA 

Has continually increased until now its 
name, fame and curative power are 
very widely known and recognized. It 
lias made its way against the most 
powerful opposition, and stands apart 
from and ahead of all competitors, not 
only as the best blood purifying and 
tonic medicine in existence, but as the 
cheapest and most economical, being 
the only one which gives one hundred 
doses for one dollar. Hence Hood's Sar- 
saparilla may appropriately be termed 
•'The People's Medicine." 



The claims made regarding the curat ive 
powers of Hood's Sarsaparilla, are based 
entirely on what the people say it has 
done for them, and not upon some 
imaginative list of diseases and com- 
plaints. There is not a single thing 
which we claim that Hood's Sarsaparilla 
will do, which it has not already accom- 
plished, as will be seen by the numerous 
letters published in this book, and whicli 
are almost entirely from people unknown 
to us, and of whom we never heard till 
they, of their own accord, wrote to us to 
tell what Hood's Sarsaparilla had done. 

HOOD'S SARSAPARILLA 

Has proven a sovereign remedy for the 
most severe cases of scrofula, whether 
in the form of terrible running sores or 
ulcers, or in the milder form of scrofulous 
humor, and for salt rheum, scald head, 
boils, pimples, ringworm, and all diseases 
of the blood. It has relieved the tortures 
of dyspepsia, biliousness, sick headache, 
indigestion, and all troubles arising from 
a weak or disordered stomach. It lias 
restored to health and strength the 
form wasted by disease or prostrated by 
change of climate, season, or life, im- 
proved the appetite, and driven off that 

EXTREME TIRED FEELING 

Which many people experience at certain 
seasons of the year. It has cured people 
who suffered greatly from that very com- 
mon complaint, catarrh ; and those who 
were afflicted with the pains and aches 
of rheumatism have found in it positive 
relief and permanent cure. What Hood's 
Sarsaparilla has done, is what we claim it 
will do. We submit that the statements 
in this book constitute conclusive proof 
that Hood's Sarsaparilla is all it is repre- 
sented to be. If you suffer from any of 
the diseases named, try

INTRODUCTION 




"The High-Street Cook Book"' was 
originally prepared and published by 
the ladies of High-Street Congregational 
Church, Lowell, Mass., for the purpose 
of being sold at their Annual Fair. The 
receipts were contributed by the ladies 
themselves, some of whom have quite a 
local reputation as excellent cooks and 
housekeepers, and were such as they had 
tried and found valuable in their own 
experience. Thus the book possessed 
the great advantage of being thoroughly 
practical, and it is not surprising that it 
was a great success. The edition pub- 
lished for the Fair was soon disposed of, 
and the demand continued so great that 
it was thought advisable to have the 
book republished. This edition, pub- 
lished by Hie proprietors of Hood's Sar- 
saparilla, is the result, And believing 
that the circulation of so excellent a 
book should not be limited, we have 
decided that our edition shall he so large 
thai every housekeeper in the country 
who desires it may have a copy. It may 
be obtained free of your druggist, or by 
sending a two-cenl stamp to the pub- 
lishers, C. I. HOOD& CO.. Lowell, Mass 



But the value of this edition of the 
High-Street Cook Book is not confined to 
the receipts and hints for cooking herein 
contained. The information that is given 
concerning the curative value of, and 
cures effected by. Hood's Sarsaparilla, is 
of sufficient importance to deserve care- 
ful reading and considerate attention. 
"Only advertising!" you say. Verj 
true. But as "only advertising." we 
believe it will prove a blessing to many 
a poor sufferer, who will learn from it 
how others have been benefited ami how 
he may he cured. Honest statements 
have a right to everybody's attention. 
And before you prepare to skip lightly 
over the "advertising." we wish to im- 
press upon your mind the fact that 
every statement we make, every testi- 
monial we use, will stand the closest 
investigation, and even the most remark- 
able cures are confirmed by conclusive 
evidence. We believe Hood's Sarsapa- 
rilla is doing a vast amount of good, and 
we republish this boot; in Hie confident 
belief that it will help on the good 
work of advancing the interests of a 
thoroughly honest and reliable medicine.

severe attacks of disease. The universal 
testimony given by those who have used 
Hood's Sarsaparilla, as to its great merits 
in restoring and sharpening the appetite. 
in promoting healthy action of the dige • 
tive organs, and as a purifier of the hlood, 
constitutes the strongest recommenda- 
tion that can be urged for any medicine.

Scrofula and Prostration. 

The severe prostration which is de- 
scribed in the following testimonial is 
often experienced by those who suffer 
from scrofulous sores or abscesses, being 
caused by the terrible drain upon the 
system made by these heads of corrup- 
tion. The power of Hood's Sarsaparilla 
to remove the scrofula taint from the 
blood, to overcome its weakening effects, 
and to tone up and restore the system to 
health, are also forcibly illustrated. 

Mr. Samuel E. Curtis, of Quincy, Mass., 
a well-known stone-cutter, says: 

" From a boy I have been troubled with 
scrofula humor. During the spring and 
summer of 1884 I was in a bad way, hav- 
ing some of the time six or seven ab- 
scesses on and about my neck. I became 
so weak as to be hardly able to drag 
myself about and was almost unable to 
work. Most of my friends felt sure that 
I was going into consumption. Very 
soon after eating, 

A DEATHLY FAINTNESS 

would come on. I felt I must soon give 
up. Every piece of work I commenced I 
felt must be my last. I had tried many 
so-called remedies, but with little or no 
benefit. About the first of July, a friend 
recommended to me Hood's Sarsapa- 
rilla, he having been benefited by its use. 
I got a bottle and commenced to take it 
regularly, according to directions. Be- 
fore I had finished the second bottle I 
had another abscess come on my side, 
but that one and the others soon com- 
menced to heal up, and all eventually 
disappeared. My general health im- 
proved. I have taken about five bottles. 
When I commenced, I weighed 127 
pounds, now 1 weigh 145, and I feel 

STRONG AM) VIGOROUS. 
I can do my good day's work with as 
much ease as ever I could at any period 
of my life. After what flood's Sarsapa- 
rilla has done for me, I feel that too much 
cannot he said in its praise. It gives me 
pleasure to recommend it to others, as I 
feel confident in regard to its intrinsic 
worth." S. E. Curtis, Quincy, Mass.

For the Children. 

Thousands of children have reason to 

be thankful for Mood's Sarsaparilla. as it 
has proven a cure for disagreeable dis- 
eases of the blood which rendered then- 
lives miserable. Even infants are cured 
of troublesome complaints by this medi- 
cine, as the following letter will show: 

" My child was born with a dry COUgh, 
and at the age of eight months was taken 
with inflammatory rheumatism. We had 
the best medical skill in the city. His 
ankles swelled greatly, and one finger 
became swollen until it turned purple. 
The doctor thought it would require am- 
putating, and Ins life was despaired of. 
Then we commenced to give him Mood's 
Sarsaparilla, When in one week he showed 

signs of improving. We gave him one 

bottle. The COUgh and swelling disap- 
peared, he gained in flesh, and is now- 
well and Strong. He has not taken any 
medicine for four months. We hope this 
may induce others to take Hood's Sarsa- 
parilla." ('. Kkmi.u.i.. Davenport. Iowa. 

Quick Effect. 

" I began taking Hood's Sarsaparilla in 
the 'spring of 1883, when I was bo weak I 
could not do my work, [must confess i 

had not a drop of faith in it ; but it has 
made a new person of me. All I ask of 
any one is to try a bottle of Hood's Sai - 
saparilla and see its quick effect. Il 
takes less time and quantity to show its 
effect than any other preparation I ever 
heard of. I would not be without it in 
the house." Mi;s. C. A. M. line. \i;i>.

An Engineer's Wife. 

Mr. IT. I). Winans, whose wife's state- 
ment is given below, is an engineer on 
the Michigan Central Railroad. He says 
that many a night, after coming home 
from a hard day's work, he had to lose 
most of his night's rest, caring for his 
invalid wife. No medical attendance or 
other medicines seemed to do her any 
good. But when she began to take 
Hood's Sarsaparilla, improvement began 
at once. She soon rested much better 
and Mr. Winans has not lost a night's 
rest since. Mrs. Winans says: 

" I have been in poor health several 
years, and have tried many medicines 
but did not receive much of any benefit 
from them. 1 was advised to try Hood's 
Sarsaparilla, and did so. I have now 
taken nearly three bottles and have rc- 
ceived more benefit from it than from 
any other medicine I ever used. My 
trouble being caused by indigestion, I 
was very much troubled with restless- 
ness dining the night, and in the morning 
would get up with a very tired feeling. 
After taking only a part of the first, bottle 
1 could rest, well all night and feel re- 
freshed when I woke up. 1 must say 
ilia) Hood's Sarsaparilla is all it is rec- 
ommended to be.'' Mrs. H. IX Winans, 
210 East Mason Street, Jackson, Mich.

Pastor ami Peoplg, 

The relations between pastor ami peo- 
ple in the smaller towns and villages, are 

as a rule much more intimate than in the 

large cities. Tin- people look to the pai 

tor for ad\ ice in temporal as well as in 

spiritual matters, and especiallj in cases 

of sickness is he Consulted. We ha\e 
just received letters, given below, in 
which the advice of a pastor who had 

himself experienced benefit from Hood's 
Sarsaparilla, was followed with the most 
gratifying results: 

"About a year ago 1 was for a long 
time a sufferer from a had humor, w hich 
came out all over my face, head, and 
neck, producing a burning sensation hard 
to endure. My neck and the lower part 
of my face were badly swollen. I had 
medical treatment, bul in vain. I could 
get no comfortable sleep, and my appe- 
tite left me. 1 was growing worse rather 
than better, when I was advised bj Mi ,

27. Sauce for dame. 

Chop an onion fine and boil it in milk; 
when done add the gravy from the bird, 
and thicken with pounded cracker. 

2S. Meat Patties. 

Line small patty-pans with good put! 
paste and hake in a quick oven. Chop 
remnants of chicken or other meat fine, 
season with salt and pepper, and heat in 
a little butter sauce. Fill the shells and 
put them back into the oven till the mix-

in this way. Take Hood's Sarsaparilla. 

29. Lobster Croquettes. 

Chop the lobster very fine and mix with 
U pepper, salt, and bread-crumbs, season 
well with celery-salt, and moisten with 
melted butter, make into cakes, dip them

30. 1'otted Piijeons. 

To twelve pigeons take one-half pound 
of salt pork, cut into thin slices, and fry 
it in the kettle in which you are to pot 
the birds. When this is cooked take out 
the slices and lay in the birds, with an 
onion chopped fine and three gills of 
water, cover up very close, and add fre- 
quently flour from the dredging-box, and 
salt and pepper to your taste. Let them 
boil for three-quarters of an hour, then 
add a thickening of browned flour and 
butter, and lay several halves of crackers 
in on the birds, to steam and be served 
witli the pork around the dish. It is nice 
to roll each bird in the brown thickening 
before putting it into the gravy. 

A Mood Purifier. 

" I have used Hood's Sarsaparilla for a 
blood purifier in my family for several 
years, and cannot speak too highly of it. 
it has been very beneficial in cases of 
cramp and colic, with which we have 
been troubled in ihis section." J. E. 
Collins. Bassett House. Piqua, Ohio. 



A Good No vie at Home. 

It was from the people of Lowell and 
vicinity that Hood's Sarsaparilla received 
its first words of praise and recommen- 
dation. Their good words led many 
others to use it, with uniform excellent 
results, and thus the knowledge of its 
curative power has become very widely 
extended. We are pleased to state that 
the popularity of Hood's Sarsaparilla lias 
continued undiminished in our own 
home, and is now, as it has been for 
years, the leading and most successful 
medicine for purifying the blood ami 
toning and strengthening the system. It 
would require a volume to contain all the 
praise Lowell people have given Hood's 
Sarsaparilla. 

Headache — Stomach Disorder. 

Mr. C. W. Marriott is the well-known 
First Assistant Fire Engineer of Lowell, 
having been in the Fire Department .31 
years -longer than any other man. He 
fully endorses his wife's statement, which 
follows : 

"Forfully sixteen years l was troubled 
with a disorder of the stomach and severe 
sick headache, which nothing seemed to 
relieve though 1 consulted physicians and 
have expended over a thousand dollars 
for prescriptions and advice. I was 
strongly urged to try Hood's Sarsapa- 
rilla, but refused for a long time. I 
bought two or three bottles, but gave 
them away without giving the medicine 
a fair trial myself. Finally, I determined 
to give it a fair trial and am glad I did so. 
1 had become all run down, suffered from 

NERVOUS PROSTRATION, 

and had the very severe attacks of 
headache every fortnight or oftener. a! 
Which times I was obliged to take to my 
bed. and being unable to endure any 
noise, could simply sutler patiently till 
the attack was over. It always ended in 
vomiting spells. Physicians seemed to 
think there was no help for me. and said 
there was nothing to build from. Soon 
alter I began to use the Sarsaparilla 
steadily, my attacks of headache became 
less and less frequent until they ceased 
altogether and I have not had the head- 
ache now for six months. My appetite

vousness has decreased. My stomach Is 
siiii somewhat troublesome al times, bul 
the headache has entirely gone, l can 

eal almost anything. When I fust look 

the Barsaparllla a humor came ou1 on my 
skin which caused some apprehension, 

and 1 erased taking the nieilieino for a 

few weeks, hut resumed, as i believed 11 
to be doing me good, and with the excel- 
lent results stated, i cheerfully recom- 
mend Hood's Barsaparllla to any who 
may be troubled with sick headache or 
disorder of the stomach." Mrs. C. W. 
m \i;i;i.>ri. 393 Middlesex Street, Lowell. 

31* Potted Pigeons. 

Tick, soak, and boll the pigeons with 
the same care as for roasting. Make a 
crust as for chicken-pie, lay the pigeons 
in whole, and season with pepper. salt, 
and shavings of butter and sweet mar- 
joram. Hour them thickly, then strain the 
water in which they were boiled and till 
the dish two-thirds with it, lay on the top 
crust, and close the edges well, make in- 
cisions with a knife, ami hake an hour 
and a half. Take Hoods Sarsaparilla. 

32. Yorkshire Pudding. 

Take a pint of milk, four tablespoon- 
fnls of flour, two eggs, and a pinch of 
salt. Bake for ten minutes in a quick 
oven, and serve with roast beef. The 
same proportions make a good batter. 

83. Chicken Croquettes. 

Fourteen ounces of chicken chopped 
line, half a pint of milk, four ounces of 
butter, one teaspoonful of gait, two table- 
spoonfuls of flour, and a pinch of cayenne 
pepper. Mix the flour smooth in a little 
of the milk, put the rest oyer a sauce-pan 

of boiling water, ami when scalded pour 
In the flour, sprinkle the salt and pepper

or a boiled leg of lamb, and cut up into 

small pieces (fat and all), and put in a 
deep dish, first a layer of bread-crumbs, 
then the meat, and then either cut up 
raw tomatoes or canned tomatoes, and 
pepper and salt until the dish is full, then 
turn in any gravy you may have left. On 
the top of the dish put coarse bread 
crumbs with little pieces of butter to 
make a handsome crust, as you would on 
scalloped oysters, and then bake for 
about three-quarters of an hour. In 
place of all bread-crumbs you can use 
some cold cooked potatoes. Hood's Sar- 
saparilla cures biliousnes and headache. 

35. Spiced Tomato Beefsteak. 

Take a very thick steak from the 
round of beef, cut gashes into it with a 
knife and fdl the holes with powdered 
cracker and spices, and little bits of but- 
ter, then roll up tightly and tie with a 
string. Take a quart of canned tomato 
in a tight sauce-pan and lay the roll of 
beef into it, cover closely, and let it cook 
slowly for at least two and a half or three 
hours, till the meat is thoroughly done. 
Then untie the roll and serve on a platter 
with the tomato about it, which will then 
be a thick sauce. Hood's Sarsaparilla 
will purify and enrich your blood.

An Important Statement. 

The letter which Ave give below is of 
unusual importance and deserves careful 
consideration, from the character and 
prominence of the gentleman who writes 
it. Professor Cilley has devoted his en- 
tire life to teaching, and is widely known 
in New England as an educator, in the 
best sense of the word, and whose pupils 
honor and respect him. He always has 
marked influence in educational, politi- 
cal, and other gatherings which he at- 
tends. He says: 

" I cheerfully give my experience in the 
use of Hood's Sarsaparilla: I had been 

TROUBLED WITH CATARRH 

a long time, and had used various medi- 
cines as remedies with no good results, 
when, in the summer of 1881, I was so 
affected by the disease that speech was 
somewhat difficult, and my voice was en- 
tirely unnatural. I then began to use 
Hood's Sarsaparilla as a remedy, and 
with such good effect, that, in a few 
weeks, speech was easy, the voice nat- 
ural, and my general health was much 
improved. Sometimes a, return of the 
disease is induced by taking cold, when I 
resort at once to the use of Hood's Sar- 
saparilla, which I keep by me constantly, 
and always find relief. I regard Hood's 
Sarsaparilla as an invaluable remedy for 
catarrh, and judging by its effects upon 
myself, I cannot, say too much in its 
praise." J. S. Cilley, Jericho, Vt. 

Bheumatism. 

" I have taken Hood's Sarsaparilla for 
rheumatism, and have received great 
benefit from it. I cheerfully recom- 
mend it as a tonic for the general sys- 
tem.'' W. lUrnnsAL, Lebanon, Ohio.

Well Known in LotoeU, 

Mi. Albert Bates, whose Btatemenl 
follows, has been for man) years em 
ployed by J. W. Bennett, Esq., a leading 
contractor ami builder of Lowell, and 
is well-known as a reliable man : 

" From 1">\1 1 I have been troubled 

with scrofula or sail rheum humor, which 

manifested itself In various disagreeable 
forms, i had sores on different parts of 

my body, and at one time I had a large 

bunch c in my neck, which develo] ed 

into a running sore and troubled me for a 
long time. The most serious affection, 
bowever, appeared aboul three yeai 

on my leg between the k and ankle. 

From an injury to the skin, which was 
comparatively slight, there grew, as the 
result Of a cold and humor, a running sore, 
which became worse and spread till at 
one time it covered a place on my leg 
fully six Inches long by three or [our 
inches wide. 1 was obliged to keep it 
bandaged constantly, and when I changed 
the bandages every night, it caused a

The sore was also very sensitive, and 
when at work a slight touch would 
cause it to bleed, ami pain Intensely. 
When 1 had suffered in this way about a 
year. I happened to be reading of the 
cures Hood's Sarsaparilla had effected in 
cases similar to mine, and I decided to 
give it a trial. In connection with the 
Sarsaparilla. I used Hood's Olive Oint- 
ment for the purpose of cooling and 

soothing the soie. and it served its pur- 
pose admirably. The effects of the Sar- 
saparilla were also soon apparent. The 

sore began to .mow less, ami in a few 
months had entirely healed, leaving a 
large scar which 1 suppose I shall always 

have upon me. My blood seems to have 
been thoroughly purified, as i bave not 
been troubled by the humor in anj way 
Blnce, though before l began taking 
Hood's Sarsaparilla i was ^< Idom free 
from it in some form, l have recommen-

Sixteen tomatoes, some bread-crumbs. 
a little butter, pepper, and salt. Bake 
the tomatoes whole, then scoop out a 
small hole at the top; fry the bread- 
crumbs, and till the holes with this as 
high as possible; then brown the toma- 
toes in the oven, and take care the skin 
does not break. Time, twenty-five min- 
utes; sufficient for nine persons. Season- 
able in August, September, and October. 

43. Scalloped Tomatoes. 

Cook macaroni soft ; place in an earthen

per, salt, and adding butter. Make the 
last layer of tomatoes, and bake until 
this layer is brown. 

44. Corn Oysters. 

Grate young, sweet corn, and to a pint 
add one egg well beaten, small teacup of 
flour, half gill of cream or milk, and a

Dyspepsia- 
Is caused by carelessness in diet, high 
living, eating too rapidly, too rich food, 
overtaxing the stomach with indigestible 
food, etc. Constipation, headache, heart- 
burn, sour stomach, distress after eating, 
faintness, dizziness, and capricious appe- 
tite are some of the many distressing 
symptoms. Persons troubled with dys- 
pepsia are miserable, hopeless, confused 
and depressed in mind, very irritable, 
languid, and drowsy. Dyspepsia requires 
careful, persistent attention, and a 
remedy to throw off the causes and tone 
up the digestive organs. Hood's Sarsapa- 
rilla has proven just the remedy in hun- 
dreds of cases. 

The Best Results. 

" I have had dyspepsia for several years 
and was urged to try Hood's Sarsaparilla, 
which I did with the very best results. 
I have also been troubled with catarrh, 
but since taking Hood's Sarsaparilla 
have been very much better. I have 
recommended it to my neighbors, and all 
who have taken it speak very highly of 
it." Mrs. Mary J. Ryan, 131 High 
Street, Indianapolis, Ind. 

Dyspepsia Entirely Cured. 

" I have been troubled with dyspepsia 
for many years, so that at times 1 would 
despair of ever being well. Medicine did 
not seem to do me any good. 1 was for a 
number of years unable to work. Two 
years ago Hood's Sarsaparilla was recom- 
mended by a friend, and I got a bottle 
and used it. It did me so much good that 
I have taken several bottles, which have 
cured the dyspepsia, and I now consider 
myself entirely well. I cannot find words 
strong enough to express satisfactorily to 
myself my feeling in favor of Hood's Sar- 
saparilla. it has done everything for me, 
and I cheerfully recommend it. I think 
it the best blood purifier in the market." 
Mi:s. S. M. Beede, Marblehead, Mass. 

" I can certify to the above as being 
true, and also say that other members of 
the family are using Hood's Sarsaparilla 
with good results." S. M. Beede.

Headache and Scrofula, 

'•Alter taking three doses of Hood's 
Sarsaparilla 1 was very much relieved 
from a terrible headache. 1 have been 
troubled more or less with scrofula for 
the past fourteen years, and my parents 
and myself have spent hundreds of dol- 
lars ior medicines, doctors' bills, etc., in 
the effort to cure it. But nothing ever 
. ted me so much as Hoods Sarsa- 
parilla. When 1 began to take it last 
October my face was a terrible sight, all 
covered with pimples, i took four bot- 
d's Sarsaparilla and now there

sufferings. I took many medicines but 
failed to receive benefit until I took 
Hood's Sarsaparilla. The disease began 

to subside, the watery pimples with their 

agonizing: itch and paim 

disappeared, and now I am entirely tree 
from the disease. My blood seems to be 
thoroughly purified, and my health is 
greatly benefited. My wife, seeing the

Canker in tin- Stomach. 
'•This certifies thai Hood's Sarsaparilla 

has been used witli perfect success in our 
family for canker in the stomach and im- 
pure blood. I consider my little one en- 
tirely cured, and shall continue its use as

Glandular Swellings. 

A peculiar form of scrofula is swelling 
of the glands of the neck, often forming 
large bunches, which are very disagree- 
able and unsightly. These bunches ac- 
cumulate a quantity of foul matter, and 
have a weakening and depressing effect 
upon the general health. We give below 
a statement from a lady who suffered 
from an affection of this kind and was 
greatly benefited by Hood's Sarsaparilla. 

" Hood's Sarsaparilla has done for me 
what the best medical treatment in this 
vicinity has failed to accomplish. My 
disease was an enlargement of the glands 
of my neck. The gland back of my left 
car was swollen as large as a hen's egg, 
and the glands on my neck and collar 
bone were swollen to about the same 
size. I doctored and suffered for eigh- 
teen long months, and could find no relief 
in anything T tried. My 

WHOLE GLANDULAR SYSTEM 

seemed affected. I read in a book 
that similar cases had been cured 
by Hood's Sarsaparilla, and I decided to 
try it. I almost immediately found relief, 
and having now taken five bottles of 
Hood's Sarsaparilla, I believe there is 
nothing equal to it for diseases of this 
kind. I have also used three boxes of 
Hood's Vegetable Pills and Hood's Olive 
Ointment with good results. T am now 
able to do my work, something 1 have 
not, done for li\e years. The swelling of 
the glands has been reduced over half, 
and I intend to keep on taking the medi- 
cine till it is entirely gone. My general 
health has never been better than now. 
T most heartily recommend Hood's Sar- 
saparilla to all Mho may be suffering, and 
T know of six families who are using it 
by hearing how I have been benefited bv 

It. Hood's Sarsaparilla has certainly 
done me great good." Mrs. William 
McDonaIiD, 94 North Street, Wooster,0. 

I'lrasinif Results. 

"I have used Hood's Sarsaparilla in 
my family the past two years as a blood 
purifier and am much pleased with the 
results. Having accomplished its object. 
I recommend it cheerfully." John H.

After Scarlet Fever. 

" I am glad to bear testimony to the 
superior worth of Hood's Sarsaparilla. 
When in the spring I felt all run down 
and much debilitated, I found it just the 
medicine to build me up. My wife also, 
after much physical prostration, found in 
its use new life and most lasting benefit. 
Upon our little girl, who had been sick 
with scarlet fever, its use was most mar- 
velous, entirely removing the poison 
from her blood and restoring her to good 
health. We, therefore, feel that Hood's 
Sarsaparilla deserves our highest praise 
and is worthy of the high favor it holds 
at the hands of the public. E. G. Strat- 
ton, Veterinary Dentist, 26 Burrill Street, 
Swampscott, Mass. 

Effectual Relief. 

We are pleased to receive the following 
from a reliable and respected merchant 
of Montpelicr, Vt.: 

" I have been afflicted with a bowel 
complaint for twenty-five years,- and as 
often as one week in eight was disabled 
for business. My wife was reading the 
testimonials of Hood's Sarsaparilla, sup- 
posing there was some truth in them. 
But I told her they were bought up and 
there was nothing to them. She urged 
me to get a bottle, and to please her I 
did so, and got the second and third. 
From the time I commenced taking 
Hood's Sarsaparilla, till now, I have been 
free from the complaint, and feel thank- 
ful that I have received effectual relief 
by taking the medicine." Jos. FlSHER, 
of Fisher & Colton, Montpelier, Vt.

COUld get nothing to do me any good. At 

times I was unable to do my work. I had 
cold feet nearly all the time — could not 
keep them warm, and my body would 
break out with fine spots. I took diffei 
cut medicines, but could get no relief. I 
saw Hood's Saisapariila advertised and 
told my husband I would try one bottle ; 

then I could tell if there was any g I in 

it. I had taken only half of it when I 
began to feel better, and for years I la \ e 
not felt as well as I do now. 1 do not 
have cold feet now, and am not troubled 
with pimples." Mi:-. I \\\n Millkk,

several different kinds of medicine, with- 
out receiving any benefit. But as soon 
as I had taken half a bottle Of Hood's

Catarrh 

Is one of the most prevalent, as well as 
one of the most disagreeable, of diseases. 
It sometimes destroys the nasal bones, 
which causes loss of the sense of 
smell; or, the matter dropping on the 
bronchial tubes causes bronchitis, and 
often pulmonary consumption. Besides 
the uncomfortable and disgusting flow 
from the nose, there are ringing and 
bursting noises in the ears, pain on the 
top of the head, and offensive breath. 
Severe nervous prostration follows, with 
a miserable, tired feeling generally. Ca- 
tarrh is a constitutional disease, and 
Hood's Sarsaparilla being a constitu- 
tional remedy, acting through the blood, 
effects cures in the most severe cases. 

Bronchial Tubes Affected. 

" I have been troubled with catarrh 
about a year, causing great soreness of 
the bronchial tubes and terrible head- 
ache. I saw 7 the advertisement of Hood's 
Sarsaparilla as a cure for catarrh, and

better. My catarrh is cured, my throat 
is entirely well, and my headache has all

Asthma or Catarrh. 

"For several years I had been troubled 
witli a kind of asthma or catarrh in my 
throat, and had tried several kinds of 
medicine but could find nothing to help 
me. My wife wanted me to try a bottle 
of Hood's Sarsaparilla. I told the drug- 
gist of whom I bought it that I had no 
faith in it. but would give it a trial, which 
I did. 1 must say T was very much bene- 
fited by using it and would recommend it 
very highly to any one having asthma or 
catarrh." ELIAS P. Devries, firm of 
Devries & Peterson, Omaha, Neb. 

Hay Fever. 

"Last summer I had what the doctors 
called hay fever, and used medicine for 
about six weeks, but received no benefit. 
I was advised to try Hood's Sarsaparilla. 
I took one bottle, which did me a great 
deal of good. I have continued to use it 
in my family and can recommend it as a 
blood purifier." G. Burris, Alton, 111.

Rheumatism 

Undoubtedly arises from impure i>i i. 

Lactic acid is formed in the decomposl 

tion of the gelatinous ami albuminous 
tissues, which, circulating with the blood, 

acts upon certain parts, and gives rise i i 
the local manifestations, the pains and 
aches, of the disease. It particularly at- 
tacks Hie lihrous ti>sues. and especially 

tho>e entering upon the composition of 

the joints. We do not claim thai Hood's 
Sarsaparilla is a positive specific for 
rheumatism; we doubl if there is. or can 

he. such a remedy. Bui we call attention 
to numerous cases of rheumatism which 
have been cured by Hood's Sarsaparilla. 
andr.sk you, if you sutler from this dis- 
ease, to give this remedy a fair trial.

any other medicine she has taken. 1

it." Joseph F. Green, corner First ami

'• I had a large ulcer on my leg below

took everything recommended, it did not 
commence to heal till I began taking 
Hood's Sarsaparilla, discarding all other

Can be applied truthfully to Hood's Sar- 
saparilla only, and it is an unanswerable 
and convincing argument as to the 
strength and real economy of this great 
medicine. From its superior strength 
only small doses are necessary. Thus a 
bottle of Hood's Sarsaparilla will average 
to last a month, while other medicines 
last but a week. So for economy and 
strength, as well as for health, buy Hood's 
Sarsaparilla.

mony as to the value of Hood's Sarsa- 
parilla. For years I have been a great 
sufferer from salt rheum, catarrh, chronic 
dyspepsia, kidney complaint and consti- 
pation. I tried medical advice and sev- 
eral kinds of medicines, all in vain. I 
am now sixty-nine years- old. and have 
been using Hood's Sarsaparilla the past 
ten months. I find myself much im- 
proved in health, and know that Hood's 
Sarsaparilla has done me more good than 
anything else I have ever used." L. A.

"Pimples were breaking out all over

good. By advice of a friend I began to 
use Hood's Sarsaparilla, and the relief 
was so marked from the very first that I 
kept on and am now entirely free from 
the headaches. 1 am not like the same 
person, my health being improved in 
every way. I also gave Hood's Sarsapa-

Tor a Good Thing. 

" Esteeming it a privilege to say a good 
word for a good thing. I gladly make thi- 
statement : About two years ago I was 
attacked with what my physician called 

i:t;\ SEP] i 
Deep-seated sores, black and red, came 
on my right limb, below the knee, which 
baffled the skill of my physician. Various 
remedies were suggested and used, until 
I had taken over twenty different kinds 
of medicine, and applied as many more 
externally, without apparent success. 

Finally I was induced to try Hood's Sar 
saparilla, and it was the first thing which 
gave me any permanent benefit. I fol- 
lowed the directions given on the 
Wrapper about the bottle. I used two 

or three bottles, and gradually recovered 

until that limb became as Strong as the 
Other. It gives me pleasure to recom- 
mend Hood's Sarsaparilla, for I believe 
it is a good medicine — one of the best 
blood medicines made." J. V. OUK,

(hills and Fever. 

"On Nov. 'S3, 1884, I went home sick 
with inflammation of the lungs, and was 
attacked every other day by chills and 
fever. I did not go out again for four 
weeks. I also have had for years rheu- 
matism, kidney complaint, and catarrh, 
which T considered incurable. My wife 
induced me to take Hood's Sarsaparilla, 
and now I am cured of everything except 
the rheumatism. Even that is growing 
less every day, and I expect to be soon 
relieved of it. I am 09 years of age, but 
can walk half a mile every day to the 
cars, and go to my business in New York 
City. I took no medicine bid Hood's 
Sarsaparilla while I was confined to the 
house, and I earnestly urge all who suffer 
from diseases caused by impure blood to 
try it." H. S. Foster, Scarborough, 
Westchester County, N. Y. 

Sick Abed for Weeks. 

"During last summer I was sick abed 
for four weeks, and had two doctors, but 
they could not seem to tell what was the 
matter with me. I was recommended to 
try Hood's Sarsaparilla. which I did. and 
it helped me right away, and also cured 
me of dyspepsia, with which I had been 
troubled for a long time. I took three 
bottles in all, and have felt well ever 
since. I think it is tbe best medicine 
for general debility there is, and for the 
good it, has done me 1 cheerfully recom- 
mend it." James Sullivan, .'"J Brown 
street. Rochester, N. Y. 

It Did Me Good. 

" I have suffered with scrofula for four 
years, and received no benefit from 
numerous medicines. Hut when 1 began 
taking Hood's Sarsaparilla it did me 
good, and 1 have received more benefit 
from it than from all other medicines. I 
am still taking it." .John Kennedy, 
Torrington, Conn.

we are continually receiving from drug- 
gists throughout the United States, is 
extremely gratifying to us. We have 
space here to present only a very few 
extracts from these letters, but they are 
'sufficient to show the esteem in which 
Hood's Sarsaparilla is held by the entire 
drug tr;de of the country, it will be 
observed that some of these druggists 
have become so convinced of the great 
value of Hood's Sarsaparilla that they 
have used it themselves, and thus are 
able to speak from personal experience 
regarding the medicine. 

"I have used Hood's Sarsaparilla in 
my family for some time with good 
results. J freely recommend it to all 
of my friends and patrons as the best 
blood purifier on earth." William S. 
Gaff, Druggist, Hamilton, Ohio. 

•• Last winter, after recovering from a 
prolonged sickness with diphtheria, and 
needing something to build me up, I took 

two bottles of Hood's Sarsaparilla. I 
felt good results from the first dose. It 
seemed to go from the top of my head to 
the ends of my toes. I know it is a good 
thing, and on the strength of my own 
experience, 1 have sold a great deal of 

Hoods Sarsaparilla. I consider it the 
best in the market." (;. H. Stkatton, 
of .1. W. Oolton & Stratton, Druggists, 
Westfleld, M 

•*l have been selling Hood's Baraapa- 
rdla for some time and it is giving good 
satisfaction Seeing the benefit people 
derived from it, i persuaded my wife to 



give it a trial. She has been troubled 
with dizziness and constipation, and her 
blood has been in bad order, — in fad, 
she has been all run down. Hood's 
Sarsaparilla is doing her a wonderful 
amount of good." p, M. BALDWIN, 

Druggist, Blanchester, Ohio. 

•We are selling large quantities of 
Hood's Sarsaparilla, and are pushing it

Lee, Druggist, 453 Grand River Avenue, 
Detroit, Mich.

parilla, and am selling large quantities 
of it, considering it one of my reliable

"I can say with good faith that I never 
had a word of fault found with Hood's 
Sarsaparilla yet. All speak of it in the 
highest terms." R. E. Knapp, M. D. 
and Druggist, Ypsilanti. Mich. 

"Hood's Sarsaparilla is as staple an 
article with me as BUgar and tea." it. S.

clination to recommend Hood's Sarsapa- 
rilla as compared with many proprietary 
medicines, as the consumers are satisfied 
with the curative effects of the same."
