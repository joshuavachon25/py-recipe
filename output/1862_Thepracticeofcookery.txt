PREFACE. 

Notwithstanding the many books that have been 
written on Cookery, there still exists a general complaint, 
either that the receipts given in them are of too expensive 
a character for general use, or that they are only adapted 
for those who already possess considerable experience in 
the art of Cookery, and are but of little service to those 
who are novices in it. 

It is hoped, however, that such objections will not apply 
to this work. 

In preparing the receipts, the author has exercised the 
greatest care and anxiety to give, by means of easy and 
distinct directions, dishes at once economical and elegant ; 
and eveiy information which could possibly be wanted to 
render them generally useful has been given. The exact 
quantity of the different ingredients, the seasoning and 
time required for each dish, has been specified, and this 
plan she trusts will prove advantageous to those who from 
want of previous experience cannot be expected to know 
these particulars. 

Another edition of the work being required, it has been 
carefully revised, and various improvements have been 
introduced. A number of new receipts have been added, 
and no pains have been spared to render this a really 
practical guide to the subject on which it treats, and to 
secure to it a continuance of the patronage which it has 
hitherto enjoyed.

SOUPS. 
To make Brown Soup. 

Take one large ox hough, cut all the meat oflf the bones 
in pieces about one pound weight, take out the marrow 
from the bones and brown it in a large pot, lay in the 
pieces of meat and brown on both sides, then add the 
bones, one large carrot, one small turnip, a parsnip, one 
head of celery, or small quantity of celery seed, half an 
ounce of whole black pepper, the same of Jamaica, one 
pound of red onions cut in two without being peeled, one 
sprig of marjoram, the same of beusil, and a little salt, cover 
up and let it simmer on a hot plate or very slow fire, for 
an hour, then fill it up with boiling water to the top, and 
let it boil slowly from six to eight hours, taking care not 
to let it off the boil. If the process of boiling reduces it 
very much, a little boiling water must be added. After it 
has boiled the time specified, strain through a hair sieve 
into a large earthen jar, return the meat to the pot, add a 
little salt, cover with boiling water, let it boil slowly for 
two hours, and strain into a separate jar. When the soup 
is wanted, skim it clean with a spoon just dipt in boiling 
water, and put it in the pan in which it is to be heated, 
taking care to keep back the sediment in the bottom of 

A

the jar. Let it come to the boil, then add a little ketchup 
and cayenne, also one glass of port wine if particularly 
desired, but according to general taste it is better without. 
If the second stock is required, skim carefully as with the 
first, and keep back the sediment, put it in the pan in 
which it is to be heated, with the whites and shells of two 
eggs a little beat up, let it boil, season as before, pour it 
through a cloth, and add to the first stock. If not required, 
it makes a very good kidney or ox-tail soup. 

Brown Soup, with Sice. 

The stock is the same as abova Do not clarify the 
soup with eggs ; take four ounces of rice, put it in a pan 
with boiling water, boil it fifteen minutes, then run it 
through a sieve ; dry it a little, and add it to the soup. 

Ox-Tail Soup. 

It is made of the same stock as the above. Take two 
ox tails and parboil ; be sure to notch them with a knife 
at the joints before you put them in the water to boil ; 
when tender take them out, and strain the water through 
a sieve. When the soup is to be served, joint them and 
put them in ; let them boil ten minutes, and season accord- 
ing to taste. 

To make Ox-Tail Soup another way. 

Take two pounds of the fleshy part of an ox hough, and 
two ox tails notched at the joints, and put them on in a 
pan, cover with water, add one tea-cupful of whole rice, 
and a little salt, skim carefully as it comes to the boil, 
and let it boil slowly for two hours, then take out the 
tails, let it boil one hour longer, taking care that it be not 
too much reduced. Strain through a hair sieve, skimjand 
return to the pan, cut the tails quite through where they 



SOUPS. 3 

have been notched, dividing some of the l&Tger pieces, add 
to the stock, boil slowly for half an hour, and season to 
taste. 

Articlioke Soup. 

Take two pounds of the hough of beef, and two pounds 
of the shank of veal, put them in a stew-pan, cover with 
cold water, skim it well before it comes to boil ; let it boil 
for four hours, and strain it through a sieve. When this 
stock is perfectly cold, skim off every particle of fat, put it 
in a stew-pan, add four ounces of the flour of rice, and stir 
occasionally tUl it boils ; clean two dozen of large arti- 
chokes, add them to the soup, and boil till quite soft, then 
pour into a sieve, pressing them through with a wooden 
spoon. When the soup is to be served, return it to the 
stew pan, add a little salt and white pepper, and let it 
come to the boil ; have a tea-cupful of good cream in the 
tureen, pour in the soup gently, stirring all the time. 

Pigeon Soup. 

Clean and quarter three pairs of young pigeons, and put 
them in milk and water and a little salt ; take tWo pounds 
of the hough of beef, and the giblets of the pigeons, put 
them in a stew-pan with cold water, add a little salt, let 
them boil for two hours, and pour through a sieve. When 
this stock is quite cold, skim the fat clean off, return it to 
the stew-pan, add the pigeons along with a handful of 
parsley and two onions previously minced, and boil for 
three- quarters of an hour. Mix with a breakfast-cupful of 
cream two table spoonfuls of flour, add to the soup, and 
let it boil for fifteen minutes ; season with pepper and salt 
to taste. 



4 SOUPS. 

Kidney Soup. 

The stock is the same as in the foregoing receipt Have 
a couple of kidneys, split them up the middle, put them 
in a stew-pan amongst cold water and boU for two hours, 
then take them out of the water, which is of no use. When 
the soup is to be served, cut the kidneys into small pieces, 
add to the stock and boil for a short time, then add 
cayenne pepper and a tea-cupful of port wine. 

To make Kidney Soup another way. 

Take two pounds of the fleshy part of an ox hough, two 
ox kidneys previously cut up and laid in salt and water 
for an hour or two, a tea-cupful of whole rice, cover with 
water, add a little salt, and skim carefuUy as it comes to 
the boU ; let it boil slowly for two hours, then take out 
the kidneys and let it boil an hour longer, put it through 
a hair sieve, and return to the pan. Have the kidneys 
cut and trimmed, add to the soup, boil for half an hour, 
and season with pepper and salt and a little Indian soy. 

Spring Soup. 

Have a good stock prepared as for brown soup ; take a 
bunch of asparagus, cut the green ends in small bits, a few 
green pease, with small sprigs of cauliflower, one dozen of 
small onions, one large carrot, and one turnip ; cut them 
in stripes, boil these vegetables separately ; when tender, 
strain them through a sieve, and add them to the soup. If 
you find the soup is not brown enough when you put in 
the vegetables, add a little browning (See Brovming), and 
salt to taste. Send it very hot to table. 

Yermicelli Soup. 

Have ready a good strong stock, and take four ounces 



SOtJPS. 5 

of vermicelli, soak in cold water, put it in a stew-pan filled 
with water, and let it boil for five minutes, then draw it to 
the side and let it stand. When the soup is to be served, 
pour the water from the vermicelli and add to it, season to 
taste, and let it boil for a short time. 

Bicli WMte Soup. 

Take six pounds of good veal and cut it down a little, 
also one fowl cleaned and cut in two, and put them in a 
stew-pan fiUed with boiling water, then add one parsnip, 
one carrot, a small piece of celery, two onions, a sprig or 
two of sweet marjoram, a blade of mace, some whole white 
pepper, boil slowly for four hours and strain through a 
hair sieve ; take off the white pieces from the breast of the 
fowl and any little bits of the veal you can find whole, 
then return the strainings to the pan with some cold water 
and let it boU for some time, which process makes a little 
additional stock ; put the pieces of fowl and veal into a 
sieve with a very little stock, and press all through with a 
wooden spoon into the soup in order to thicken it. When 
the soup is to be used, skim the fat well off, put it on in a 
clean stew-pan, keeping back the sediment, dissolve a tea- 
cupful of rice flour in cold water along with a little of the 
stock, and add to the boiling soup, stirring till it comes to 
the boil agam, so as to keep it perfectly smooth. Another 
way of thickening this soup, instead of the pounded meat 
and rice flour, is as follows : — Beat the yolks of four eggs, 
add to them a breakfast-cupful of good cream, then pour 
both into the tureen ; and just before sending the soup to 
table, take a ladleful of it boUing, pour it in amongst the 
eggs and cream, stirring all the time, then pour in the 
whole, and stir a little more, so as to mix them thoroughly 
and make the soup perfectly smooth

Yegetablfi Marrow Sonp. 

Take ti^o pounds of hough, the same of the knuckle of 
veal, one tea -cupful of whole rice, and put them on in a 
pan, cover with water, add about the fourth of a nutmeg 
grated, and a little salt, skim carefully as it comes to the 
boil, then take a large vegetable marrow, cut into slices 
and skin ; take out the seeds gently, taking caie not to 
waste the juice, add to the soup, boil slowly for three 
hours, and strain through a hair sieva "When wanted, skim 
and return to the pan, and add a little white pepper and 
salt ; have a tea-cupful of good cream in the tureen, pour 
in the boiling soup, and stir a little while doing so. This 
soup should always be used the day in which it is made, 
as by keeping, it partly loses the peculiar flavour of the 
vegetable marrow. 

Oyster Soup. 

Have about a Scotch pint of good stock, as for white 
soup, put it in a stew-pan, take a tea-cupful of rice flour, 
dissolve in cold water, add to the stock, and stir till it boil 
for five minutes, being careful that it does not boil over ; 
have one hundred and a half of oysters, put them on the 
fire in their own liquor, and shake them occasionally until 
they just boil up, then take them oflF immediately, as one 
minute's boiling will cause them to shrink and become 
quite tasteless, strain them through a sieve into a basin 
and preserve the liquor ; when the liquor clears, pour it 
into a stew-pan, keeping back the sediment, add to it four 
blades of mace, some whole white pepper, and let it boil 
slowly for half an hour closely covered, then strain and add 
to the stock. Beard the oysters, pick off any bit of shells 
which may be about them ; and just before serving add 
them to the soup along with a tea-cupful of good cream, 
make it quite hot, but do not let it boil.

cover with cold water and a little salt, skim clean when it 
conies to the boil, let it boil for two hours, and take out 
the veal ; have one or more chickens cleaned, put them 
in the stock to boil for fifteen minutes, then take them 
out, and add two or three onions, two blades of mace, a 
little whole white pepper, boil for half an hour, and strain 
through a sieve. When the stock is cold, skim the fat off 
and return it to the stew-pan, keeping back the sediment, 
add the chickens, having carved them as for the table, and 
let them boil for fifteen minutes, then add some finely 
minced parsley previously boiled in a little salt and water, 
and let it come to the boil again. Beat up the yolks of 
four eggs, add to them a tea-cupful of cream, pour into the 
tureen, then add the boiKng soup and chickens, stirring all 
the time. 

Jenny land Soup.

cold, then skim carefully and return to the pan ; add two 
table-spoonful of small minced parsley, a little pepper and 
salt, and boil for fifteen minutes. Have the yolks of four

nip, one turnip, two large onions, a quantity of herbs, a 
handful of parsley, a little whole white pepper, three blades 
of mace, and some additional boiling water, so as to make 
plenty of stock. When the head is cold, take the meat 
from the bones, split the head in two, take out the brains, 
and add the bones to the boiling stock, let it boil gently 
till the substance is extracted, and strain it through a hair 
sieve. When the stock is firm, skim off aU the fat, return 
it to the stew-pan, keeping back the sediment, and add to 
it the meat taken from the head previously cut in small 
pieces, about an inch and a half square, also the tongue, 
skinned, trimmed neatly in the same way, and let it boil

SOUPS. 15 

Eice Brotli. 

Take a knuckle of veal, put it in a stew-pan, and pour 
boiling water so as to cover it ; put one carrot, one turnip, 
a little salt and whole white pepper, and let it boil .for two 
hours, then take out the veal and strain the soup, and put 
back the veal and soup into the stew-pan ; add a tea-cup- 
ful of whole rice, and boil it till tender; mince some 
parsley and two onions, and put them in the soup ; let it 
boil fifteen minutes. Before dishing, have two yolks of 
eggs beat up, with one tea-cupful of cream, and put the 
eggs and cresun in your tureen, then pour in the boiling 
soup, stirring aU the time. 

Sheep's-Eead Broth. 

Have a sheep's-head and feet singed, split it up, take 
out the brains, and rub the head and feet with, them ; let 
it lie all night, and in the morning put it on the fire, in a 
pot with cold water. Let it get hot, but not to boil ; take 
it from the fire and let it stand one hour, then wash it 
well, and brush before they are put on to boiL Have a 
pot ready, put in one tea-cupful of barley, two ounces of 
whole rice, two pounds of the neck of mutton ; put in the 
head and feet, and plenty of cold water and a little salt. 
Skim it well, and when it comes to boil, draw it to the 
side of the fire, and let it boil slowly but constantly for two 
hours ; then add carrots, turnips, onions, cut neatly, and 
let it boil for other two hours, salting to taste. If your 
head is tender, take the broth off the fire, dish the head 
with the feet round it, and pour a little melted butter and 
minced parsley. 

Hodge Podge. 

Take six or eight pounds of the back ribs of mutton ; 



1 6 FISH. 

cut off six chops from the best end ; trim off the fat and 
put them aside ; take a piece of mutton, put it in a stew- 
pan, put plenty of water into it and a little salt ; skim it 
clean when it comes to boil ; cut two heads of cauliflower 
very small, wash it well, and put it in the pot, adding one 
English pint of carrots, one of turnips, cut small, two 
English pints of pease, and boil them all together for two 
hours. Take out the piece of mutton and put in the chops, 
another pint of very green pease, the white part of one 
dozen of young onions, and salt to taste. If you find the 
hodge podge not thick enough, add a few more vegetables, 
and let them all boil one hour. This soup should never 
be ready long before it is to be dished, as by standing it 
loses the green colour. Serve it hot with the chops in the 
tureen. 

Browning for Soups and Sauces. 

Take a pound of raw sugar, put it in a sauce- pan, pour 
in a tea-cupful of water and put it on the fire until the 
sugar is- melted ; let it boil slowly for fifteen minutes, add 
a little more water to it, and let it boil until you have 
reduced it to one English pint ; run it through a piece of 
book muslin, and when it is cold bottle it up. This is 
very good browning for soup, but India soy is preferable. 



FISH. 

Dressed Cod. 

Have a good large cod, cut off the head, with a small 
piece of the shoulder ; lay your fish in a good deal of salt 
for a night or so, cut off the fins, skin the body of the fish, 
cut off the tail, a piece of about six inches, and put the 
small piece in the inside of it ; roll them up neatly, and

cord it with a piece of twine. Have a pan of boiling 
water, plenty of salt, with a little vinegar ; put in the fish, 
and when it boils take oflf the cover a little to the side ; 
let it boil for twenty- five minutes, take it off the fire, but 
do not let it lie in the water. After it is boiled, draw up 
the drainer and place it across the fish-pan, and cover it 
with a dry clean clotL Before dishing, cut off the cord, 
lay it on a napkin, and garnish with fried roes or whitings, 
and parsley, plain butter, oysters, or anchovies. You can 
bake this piece of cod by keeping out the small piece, 
boning the large piece, and putting in stuflfing (See Fisk 
Stuffing). 

To dress Cod's Head and Shoulders. 

Take a good cod, cut the head and shoulders the size 
you want, put the fish upon a board, pour boiling water 
upon it, then scrape it gently with a knife to take the 
black off, but do not take off the skin. When the fish 
becomes white, lay it in cold water until it gets firm, and 
lay it in salt for some time before you boil it. When you 
are to dress it, have a pan with plenty of boiling water 
and salt, and a little vinegar ; put in the fish and boil it 
for half an hour, but do not boil it with the cover close, as 
it spoils the fish and makes it sofL Skin the tail-piece 
and cut it into small pieces, roll them and tie them with 
a piece of twine, brush them over with a beat egg, and 
strew bread crumbs over them. Have your fiying-pan 
with plenty of lard very hot, put in the fillets and fry them 
for ten minutes, turn them upon the other side ; they will 
require other ten minutes before they are done ; then lay 
them upon a sieve before the fire to drain. Dish the head 
and shoulders upon a napkin, lay the fried fillets round 
them, and garnish with parsley. Send oyster sauce ia a 
tureen.

Dressed Eisli with Paste Border. 

For a large dish, have seven ordinary-sized haddocks ; 
clean, and let them lie amongst a little salt for about 
twelve hours, then skin and split up the back on each 
side of the bone, in order to divide them in two ; after 
which, turn neatly, and roll them up, then place six of the 
haddocks in a baking dish that wiU just hold them ; cover 
closely with another dish of the same size, and put in the 
oven, bake for three-quarters of an hour, then take the re- 
maining fish and mince down with two ounces of marrow, 
a little grated bread, cayeime pepper, and moisten with 
an ^g. It may be improved by a little parsley, and a 
small onion minced, roll out a quarter of an inch thick, 
cut into a round shape about the size of an egg-cup, fry 
them to a light brown, then have a quarter of a himdred 
of oysters, scalded and bearded, have about an English 
pint of stock deduced from skins, bones, and heads of the 
haddocks ; knead three ounces of butter among two table- 
spoonfuls of flour, put it in half a tea-cupful of cream, 
and add to the stock ; shake over the fire imtil it boil, 
then add the oysters. Have a baked paste border round 
the dish on which they are to go to the table ; pour in the 
sauce first, then place the rolls neatly above, sprinkling 
cayenne, or pounded lobster roe, on the top of each roll ; 
place the fish cakes between them, and small sprigs of 
parsley alternately. Endeavour to send up to table as hot 
as possible. 

To clean and prepare Haddocks. 

Have some haddocks, take out the inside, cut them open 
considerably below the vent ; wash them well, but do not 



FISH. 19 

scrape the skins ; cut off the point of the toil, take out the 
eyes and gills, put in some salt into the bodies, let them 
lie until next day, then put them upon a fish heck oi a 
wooden rod put through the eyes ; hang them in a cool 
place in the air ; they may be boiled or broiled, taking off 
the heads and skins. 

Boiled Haddocks with Oysters. 

Have two or three good haddocks, of the middle size, 
prepared as the above ; cut them into fillets just at dinner- 
time ; put them in a fish pan, with as much boiling water 
as will cover them, a handful of salt, and let them boil 
five minutes with the cover off A little before you boil 
the haddocks, have a sauce made, take an English pint of 
white stock, put in the heads, skins, and fins of the had- 
docks, boil them for twenty minutes, then strain it ; melt 
two ounces of butter with a table-spoonful of flour, a tea- 
cupful of cream, stir until very smooth, add this to the 
stock ; put it upon the fire, and stir until it boils ; it 
should be very thick. Add one quarter hundred of oysters 
to it, but do not let the sauce boil after you have put in 
the oysters, or you will spoil it. Have the dish you are 
to serve the fish upon very hot, lay the haddocks in a ring 
and pour the sauce in the centre, garnishing with parsley 
round the edge of the dish. 

Another way to boil Haddocks. 

Glean and skin them, put their tails through their eyes, 
boil and dish them upon a napkin, garnishing with parsley, 
fried roes, or spirlings, and send up with shrimp sauce. 
(See Shrimp Sauce?)

20 FISH. 

skin and bone them into neat fillets, put on the heads, 
bones, and fins, with two sliced onions, a little whole black 
pepper, and cayenne, cover with cold water, let them boil 
for twenty minutes, and strain through a sieve. Brown 
four ounces of butter in a stew-pan, with some flour, 
brush the fillets over with beaten egg, put them in and 
brown on both sides, then add the stock, along with one 
table-spoonful of ketchup, one of browning sauce, and the 
same of Chili vinegar ; let all simmer for fifteen minutes, 
without the cover, salt to taste, place the fillets in a circle 
iround the dish, pour the sauce into the centre, and garnish 
with parsley. 

Dressed Fish with Balls.

four, put on the skins, heads, and tails in a stew-pan, and 
cover with boiling water ; let them boil for half an hour, 
then strain them. Take one of the fillets, and take the 
fish clean off the bone, and mince small, with an ounce of 
suet, a small onion, a little parsley, a sprig of marjoram, 
and six oysters ; add a few bread crumbs, season with 
cayenne and salt, moisten with the yolk of an egg, roll 
into eight or nine balls, and brown them in the frying- 
pan. Take four ounces of butter, and brown it with flour 
in a stew-pan ; then brown the fiUets of fish on both sides, 
and pour in as much of the stock as will nearly cover 
them. Then add the balls, one table-spoonful of ketchup, 
one of vinegar, one of India soy, and let all boil briskly for 
fifteen minutes. Dish the fish neatly round the dish, and

breast. Have a large fish-kettle of boiling water ready, 
with a good deal of salt and a little vinegar ; lay in the 
fish upon the back, boil it slowly for twenty-five minutes, 
with the cover off If the fish is very large, it will require

To fry Haddocks. 

Take some smaU haddocks, skin and trim them neatly, 
and put their tails through their eyes. Have plenty of 
lard in a stew-pan, and let it be very hot. The way to 
know that the lard is hot enough, is to dip your finger in 
cold water and let it drop into the stew-pan ; if it is hot 
enough, it will make a great noise. Brush the fish over 
with beat-up eggs, and strew them over with bread 
crumbs, put them into the lard, fry them a light brown, 
and when done lay them on a sieve before the fire to 
drain. Whitings are prepared the same way. Send beat

half broad ; cut four or five slices, roll them up in a round 
ring, and tie them with a bit of tape ; put them in the 
fish-pan, in boUing water, a little salt, and boil them 
fifteen minutes. Before you dish them, cut off the tape, 
and dish the largest roll in the centre with the others 
around it, garnish with parsley, and serve it with shrimp 
or anchovy sauce. 

To dress Skate. 

Clean and skin the skate as above; you can either 
crimp it or cut it into square pieces. Make a stock of 
the skin and spare piece of the skate, put it on with a 
little stock if you have it, and slice down two onions, a 
little sweet herbs, boil until you have all the substance 
extracted ; then strain it. Take a stew-pan, put in about 
four ounces of butter, brown it, shake in some flour, shake 
the pan to keep it from burning, till you have made it a 
fine light brown. Have the pieces of skate brushed over 
with a beaten egg, lay them in the stew-pan, brown it 
well, turn it over on the other side, brown it, pour in the

BEEF. 
To stew a Eump of Beef. 

. Let your beef hang for some days to make it tender, 
bone it, and lard it thickly with bits of bacon ham. Take 
a sauce -pan that will hold the beef, put some slices of 
pork in the bottom of the stew-pan, have the beef rubbed 
over with fresh drippings, brown it before the fire for an 
hour, lay it in the stew-pan, and put it on a slow fire, add- 
ing two quarts of good stock, some whole black pepper, six 
small onions whole, three bay- leaves, and a few sweet 
herbs. Let it simmer at the side of the fire for three or 
four hours ; one hour before dinner take out the beef and 
put it in the oven, or before the fire, to keep it hot ; glaze 
the beef, have the gravy in which you stewed the beef 
reduced to a quart, strain it, and skim the fat clean off, 
Take a small stew-pan, brown a bit of butter, shake-

in flour, and make it a nice light brown; pour in ihe 
stock, let it boil a little, add a table-spoonful of mushroom 
ketchup, and one of lemon pickle ; dish the beef and pour

and spinage (See Spinage), 

Another way to stew Beef. 

Take from ten to twelve pounds of the middle part of a 
brisket of beef, cut out all the bones, sprinkle a little 
pepper, roll it up neatly, and bind it with a piece of cord, 
put it before the fire one hour, to brown it. Take a stew- 
pan large enough to hold it, put in half a gallon of water, 
then lay in the beef, add one head of celery, four onions, a 
handful of parsley, half an ounce of black pepper, cayenne, 
and salt Let it stew slowly for three or four hours, have 
some carrots and turnips cut out, and boil them in a little 
stock with a little salt. The carrots will require double 
the time the turnips take, therefore you will require to 
put in the carrots one hour before you add the turnips. 
Take out the beef, glaze it, strain the stock, and skim off 
the fat. Then brown a bit of butter in a small stew-pan, 
shake in a good deal of flour, add an English pint of the 
stock, and a little of the water in which you boiled the 
vegetables. Stir it till it boils, drain the vegetables, put 
them into the sauce -pan, adding a table-spoonful of hot 
vinegar, one of brown sauce, and salt to taste. Cut the 
cord off the beef, and lay it into a dish. Pour the sauce 
and vegetables round the beef ; then stick a vegetable 
flower at each end. 

To dress a Eound of Beef. 

Have a round of ox-beef, from sixteen to twenty pounds, 
nicely cut ; cut out the bone, rub it over with common 
salt, and let it lie two or three days upon a flat large dish. 



BEEF. 35 

Have a pickle prepared of the following : three pounds of 
bay salt, one ounce of saltpetre, one ounce of salt prunella, 
and pound them, one pound of coarse sugar, and two 
gallons of water ; put it upon the fire, stir it occasionally 
to prevent the ingredients falling to the bottom ; skim it 
well when it begins to boU, let it boil twenty minutes, take 
it off and let it stand till cold ; then put the beef into a 
small pickling tub or jar, pour the pickle over it, keeping 
back the grounds, lay a clean heavy stone upon it, put on 
a close cover, and turn it every alternate day. The meat 
will be excellent in fourteen days, and it will not be over 
salt, although you should keep it for six weeks. A little 
cochineal improves the colour when it is in the pickle. 
When you are to use it, bind it tightly with a cord ; put 
it into a large stew-pan with plenty of cold water, put it 
on the fire till it begins to boil, skim as long as the scum 
rises, draw it to the side of the fire, and let it simmer 
slowly for four hours ; it will be improved by standing in 
the water a while ; before it is wanted have some vegetable 
greens and carrots boiled. Before dishing the beef, make 
it hot, and take off the cord it was bound with ; put in 
a silver or iron skewer, garnish with some vegetable 
flowers, the greens and carrots alternately roomd the beef, 
and pour a little of the water in which the beef was boiled 
over it. 

To com a Brisket of Seef. 

Have from fourteen to fifteen pounds of the brisket of 
beef; rub it over with common salt, and let it lie for three 
days ; put it in the above pickle with a heavy weight 
upon it, and turn it every day ; it will be for use in ten 
days. When you are to boil it, do not soak it in water ; 
put it in a stew-pan and cover it with cold water ; when 
it boils, draw it to the side of the fire, and let it boil 



36 BEEF. 

slowly until the ribs draw out. Have some carrots and 
greens boiled separately to garnish with ; or if you wish it 
cold, when it is done, take it out of the water, take out all 
the bones, roU it in a clean cloth, and put a heavy weight 
upon it all night. If wanted for breakfast, trim it neatly, 
and garnish with green parsley. 

To stew a Brisket of Beef. 

Take from twelve to fourteen pounds of the nine-holes 
of beef, bone neatly before rolling up and cording, sprinkle

stir till it boils, then skim the fat clean off, and add one 
table-spoonful of ketchup, one of India soy, one of Chili 
vinegar, and one dozen of minced truffles. Take off the 
cord, dish the beef, pour the sauce over it, and garnish 
with parsley. 

To stew a Brisket of Beef another way. 

Take twelve pounds or more of the nine-holes of beef, 
bone it, and sprinkle with pepper, then roll up and cord 
it ; have a large stew-pan or pot, place the bones in the 
bottom to prevent the meat from burning, put it in, cover 
up, and let it simmer slowly on a hot plate, or very slow 
fire, for four hours, turning occasionally, then add a little 
boiling water and let it simmer an hour longer. For the 
sauce : brown three ounces of butter in -a stew-pan, with 



BEEF. 37 

as much flour as it will take in ; add a little brown soup 
or stock, let it boil five minutes, then add some pieces ot 
pickled cucumbers, one dozen of large oysters, or button 
mushrooms, a little ketchup, cayenne, and salt to taste. 
Take the cord oflf the meat, place it on the dish on which 
it is to be sent to table, and pour the sauce over it. 

To broil a Brisket of Salt Beet 

Have from twelve to fourteen pounds of the nine-holes 
of beef salted, bone neatly, roll up, and cord tightly. It 
may have a force-meat stifl&ng, if liked. Put it on covered 
with cold water, let it boil for three hours, and let it stand 
in the water tiU cold, then take it out, take oflf the cord, 
trim neatly, and garnish with shred lettuce or parsley. 

To roast a Sirloin of Bee£ 

To sixteen pounds of beef allow three hours to roast 
Have a good clear fire ; put the roast before the fire, about 
ten inches distant from it. If you have not a spit, turn 
the bone side to the fire first, and gradually draw it near 
the fire. Have a piece of paper put round the roast, and 
fix it with a wooden skewer. Baste it with a little rich 
drippings at first, and keep basting it with fat all the time 
you are roasting it. The flavour and richness of roast 
meat depend greatly upon basting it while roasting. 
Fifteen minutes before you dish it, sprinkle a little salt, 
and dredge it with flour. Put it close to the fire till it 
froths up, then dish it, and have a little of the gravy, with 
water and salt ; pour it over the beef, and garnish with 
grated horse radish.

bread crumbs, minced suet, a little chopped parsley and 
salt. Beat up one egg, and mix it well together, and 
put a little bit of the forced- meat over the steaks. Eoll 
and tie them up with a tape, make them so as to stand 
upon their ends. When you are to dish them, take a 
stew-pan that will just hold them all, brown a piece of

and pour the sauce in the middle. Garnish with sliced 
cucumbers. 

Beef-Steaiks. 

Have the steak cut from the heuck-bone or ribs. Have 
a clear fire and clean gridiron ; let it become hot, then rub

square ; take a little beef drippings, brown it, shake in 
flour until it becomes a light brown. Put in the collops, 
brown them upon both sides ; put on the cover close, and 
draw them to a side of the fire. Have one dozen of onions 
stewed amongst rich stock, and pour in the onions into 
your stew-pan with the collops. Let them stew for half 
an hour slowly ; add pepper and salt to taste, and a 
table-spoonful of ketchup. Take the cover off the stew- 
pan and put it on the fire, and reduce the stock to very 
little. Dish it very hot. 

Scotcli CoUops another way. 

Take some thick slices of beef from the fleshy end of 
the heuck-bone, about four inches square, lay them in a 
stew-pan on a very slow fire ; cover up, and let them

that will hold it easily, sprinkle a little salt over it, and 
tie a piece of cloth over the jar ; put it into a close stew- 
pan among cold water, about four inches deep, and let it 
simmer for six hours, adding a little boiling water occa- 
sionally, taking care not to allow it to boil into the jar. 
This beef tea is very beneficial for a weak consumptive 
person. 

To cure Beef for a Ham. 

Have the ham cut as much in the form of a sugar-loaf 
as you can, without the bone, when it is quite fresh. Eub 
it with common salt, and let it lie three days. Prepare a 
pickle of the following : four gallons of water, six pounds 
of bay salt, two ounces of saltpetre ; pound the salt and 
saltpetre together ; two pounds of raw sugar, put it on 
the fire and scum it well, and stir from the bottom. Let 
it boil for an hour ; take it off and let it stand tiU cold. 
Wipe the beef with a dry cloth and put it into your pick- 
ling tub. Pour the pickle oVer it, and put a weight upon 
the beef, in order that it may be entirely covered with the 
pickle. Turn it every two days, and let it lie in the 
pickle for four weeks. Take it out and cord it up very 
tight. If you wish to have it smoked, hang it up in an 
out-house, or open vent, with a fire made of hardwood- 
tree leaves and sawdust. When it has hung for two 
weeks, wrap it up into paper, and hang it in a dry cold 
place. This pickling answers for pickling pork, ham, and 
tongues. Tongues should be rubbed with salt and salt- 
petre six days before they are put into the pickle. You 
may preserve this pickle as long as you please, by boiling 



42 BEEF. 

it up every six weeks, and adding a little sugar and com- 
mon salt to it. 

To salt Beef for immediate use. 

Take whatever piece of beef you want, and rub with 
conmion salt, for half an hour, as much as you can rub into 
it. Take a washing tub, fill it half full of cold water, and 
lay two small sticks across it. Lay the beef upon them,

trim it neatly. Put it into a stew-pan with a piece of 
butter and flour, brown it a little, and put in an English 
pint of the liquor in which it was boiled. When it boils, 
put the tongue into the stew-pan, two whole onions, two 
slices of turnip, and a small piece of celery, and let it 
simmer at the side of the fire. When wanted, take out 
the tongue, glaze it, keep it hot, pick the vegetables out 
of the sauce, add a spoonful of mushroom ketchup, one of 
lemon pickle, pepper and salt to taste. Dish the tongue, 
and you can either send it up plain, or garnished with 
spinage. 

To dress Kidneys and Skirts. 

Cut up the kidneys, wash and put them on in cold 
water, and let them boil for an hour, then strain them.

stock or gravy. Simmer them an hour at the side of the 
fire, then season with salt and pepper, and a spoonful of 
ketchup. Send it up hot. 

To make &la2e. 

If you have the liquor in which hanis or tongues have 
been boiled, take a whole hough of beef, and an ox-foot 
or any scraps of veal, and put them into a large pot and 
boil slowly for ten or twelve hours, then strain it. Put 
back the bones and m^at, cover them with boiling water, 
let them boil slowly for two hours, strain them, and when 
all the stock is cold, skim very clean. Put it into a sauce- 
pan, set it upon the fire and let it boil slowly, without a 
cover, tUl it be i*educed to a small quantity. You must 
attend to it lest it should boil over or bum. When it 
is done enough, dip a spoon in it, touch it with your 
thumb and finger, and if it cause them to stick together, it 
is ready. Put it into jelly-pots. When you are to use it, 
set the jelly-pot in amongst warm water, tQl it becomes 
liquid ; have a brush, and glaze hams, tongues, fowls, stewed 
beef, cutlets, sweet-breads, etc. 

To make &laze another way. 

Take two large ox houghs weighing about twenty pounds 
each, and two feet, cut them in pieces, and put on in a 
laige pot, cover with cold water, add a little salt and 
cayenne, and scum very carefully as it comes to the boiL 
Let it boil slowly for twenty-four hours, then strain through 
a hair-sieve into an earthen jar. Eetum the meat and 
bones to the pot, cover with boiling water, let it boil four 
hours, and strain into a separate jar. When both cold, 
skim carefully, and put them together into a pan, taking 
care to keep back the sediment. In the process of heating,

becomes sufficiently strong. When it is off the boil, pour 
it into Veasands^ and hang up in a dry place. 

To make a JAsk d Tdpe. 

Have the tripe well cleaned and soaked in water for some 
time ; cut into small pieces, and put into a pot, with a 
marrow bone in the bottom, along with as much water as 
covers, but no salt. Let it boil slowly for four hours. If 
wanted to keep for some days, dish into a number of 
dishes. If wanted with a brown sauce, brown butter and 
flour, with some onions, then add the tripe, stew for half 
an hour, and season with salt If wanted white, mix a 
table-spoonful of flour with a tea-cupful of cream, or knead 
a little butter and flour together, and dissolve in milk and 
add to the tripe. 



MUTTOK 

To roast a &igot of Mutton. 

Have the mutton cut in the form of a bacon ham ; cut 
about three inches off the point of the shank ; if to roast 
upon a spit, an hour and a half will do before a clear 
fire ; but it will require two hours in an oven. If before 
the fire, baste it well all the time it is roasting. Before 
you dish it, melt a little butter, dust the roast with flour, 
baste it with butter, and when it froths up, dish it and put 
a rose of paper upon the shank. Get a little gravy in a 
small stew-pan, a little salt, a table -spoonful of vinegar,

makes a very good disli by boning in the same way, and 
laying in salt for three days, then cord it and boil for two 
hours and a half. Serve with a little of the water in 
which it is boiled, and a table -spoonful of vinegar. 

To boil a &igot of Mutton,

water one hour, wash it well, cut a piece off the point of 
the shank bone, and put it into a pot with boiling water, 
which will cover it. Add a little salt, and two ounces of 
whole rice. Draw it to one side of the fire, and let it 
boil slowly two and a half hours, Some like it under

brown a little, put a little melted butter with flour, until 
it froths up. Cut off the cord, and have a little gravy and 
a table-spoonful of vinegar poured over it 

To roast a Saddle of Mutton. 

Have the saddle neatly cut, take the skin off, then 
fix the skin on the mutton with a wooden skewer ; hang 
it before the fire to roast. It will require one hour and a 
half before a clear fira Fifteen minutes before you dish 
it, take off the skin, and brown it with butter and flour, 
until it froths ; or, in place of fix)thing it, you may glaze 
it Serve with gravy as the above. Send up red-currant 
jelly in a sauce-tureen. 

Saddle of Mutton another way. 

Have a saddle, weighing about fourteen pounds, split up 
the rump, cut on each side of the back bone in the inside 
of the saddle, take out the chop bones, then the back bone, 
commencing at the chop end, and going on till you come 
to the rump. Sprinkle the inside with pepper and salt,

mutton ; moisten it with port wine, cover it with the skin, 
and let it Ue for four days. Take two pounds of flour, a 
quarter of a pound of dripping, pour in boiling water, and 
make a paste. Eoll it out as large as you think will cover 
the mutton. Take off the skin and place the mutton in 
the paste, covet it all over with the paste, and have a 
piece of strong paper, butter it, tie it round the paste. It 
will require three hours to roast before a clear fire, or two 
hours in a quick oven. When you dish it, take off the 
paste and glaze it. Serve it with rich gravy over it, and 
hot claret in a sauce-tureen, and red-currant jelly. 

To dress a iHeck of Mutton.

and take out the bone. Make stuffing, one ounce of suet, 
a tea-cupful of bread crumbs, one onion, and a little pars- 
ley minced fine, some sweet herbs, pepper and salt, and a 
little cayenne. Mix it up with one egg, and put this into 
the neck of the mutton in place of the bone. EoU it 
neatly, and tie it with a piece of twine. Put it into boil- 
ing water and boil it two hours. When you dish it cut 
off the twine, and serve it with caper sauce. Or you may 
brown it before the fire, and make a sauce of the bones ; 
lay in the neck of mutton, and stew it, thicken it with 
flour, adding ketchup, with a table-spoonful of hot vinegar 
poured over it. This answers weU for a corner dish, if 
there is no joint of mutton on the table. 

A Mutton HadGot.

prepared with a few chopped oysters, and put it in where 



POULTRY. 155 

the crop was taken out ; sew it up, put the turkey in a 
pot which will just hold it, with the breast down ; cover 
it with cold water, add a tea-cupful of milk, skim it when 
it comes to boil, draw it to the side of the fire, and let it 
boil slowly ; if the turkey is young, one hour will boil it, 
but if an old one, it will require two hours. When you 
dish it, take off the tape, and serve with either oyster, 
celery, or plain white sauce, with small white turnips and 
cauliflower. 

Another way to trusS a Turkey for boiling. 

Have a good large turkey, bone it, take a pickled tongue, 
and boil it for one hour, skin it, trim off all the fat, turn 
up the point of the tongue, place the tongue into the inside 
of the turkey, putting the root-end of the tongue in the 
breast. Have a stuffing of force meat ready, stuff it neatly, 
and sew it ; run a skewer through the turkey and tongue, 
to keep the turkey in a proper shape ; tie it into a floured 
cloth, put it in cold water, and let it boil slowly but con-- 
stantly for forty-five minutes. Dish it, and serve with 
white sauce and boiled cauliflower. 

Capeiatie. 

When you have a cold turkey, either roasted or boiled, 
take off the legs and wings, cut all the meat off the bones, 
break the bones, put them in an English pint of boiling 
water, and let it boil until you have reduced it to one-half; 
then strain it, mince the meat of the turkey very small, 
seeuson with white piepper, salt, and nutmeg ; mix a table- 
spoonful of flour with a tea-cupful of thick cream, and add 
this to the sauce you strained from the bones ; put it upon 
the fire, and stir it until it boils ; put in the mince, shake 
until it becomes hot, and add a table-spoonful of lemon 
pickle, or hot vinegar ; score the legs and wings of the

it over, put it into the lard, with as much of the batter as 
will cover it ; go on until you have finished all the apples, 
then fry them a nice light brown on both sides ; dish 
them neatly upon a napkin, and shake pounded sugar over 
them.

them in the batter, and fry them in boiling lard or fresh 
butter. Drain them on a sieve before the fire ; arrange 
them on a table-napkin tastefully, and sift white sugar 
over them.

the soufile. Just when you are dishing your dinner, put 
it in a quick oven, and let it remain until you are to send 
it to table. Serve on a table-napkin, ornamented with 
friUed paper. 

Puff Paste. 

To one pound of flour take one poimd of butter ; if 
fresh butter, put in a little salt amongst the flour ; pour 
in water, and work up the flour with your hand to a dough. 
Take it out and lay it upon the table or on a marble slab, 
knead it till smooth, and divide it in two, roll one piece 
out, then make it round and lay it aside. Eoll out the 
other piece of dough the same size, and take the butter and 
roll it out the same size, lay it in between the two pieces of 
dough, press it round the edge with your fingers, to pre- 
vent the butter from bursting out, put a little flour under 
and over it, and roll it out lightly, as broad as you can 
make it. Fold the four sides in the centre, double it over 



rUDDlNGS. 139 

* 

and then roll it out again. Fold it once more, and roll it 
out a third time, when it is ready for any purpose. Paste 
should always be put in a quick oven when it is ready, if 
it has to stand for any time, cover it up to keep it from the 
air. You may bake paste in winter anywhere, but in 
summer, when the weather is hot, you should bake it in 
as cool a place as possible. Common paste for meat pies 
is made exactly the same way as the above, but only half 
a pound of butter to one pound of flour. 

Puff Paste another way. 

Take equal weight of butter and flour, cut the butter in 
small pieces, and mix freely and lightly with the flour, and 
as much cold water as will make it a nice soft dough, 
handling it as little as possible. Eoll out to a large sheet, 
dusting it now and then with a little flour, to prevent it 
from sticking either to the table or rolling-pin. Give it 
six folds, roll out again, then five folds, when it is finished. 
It is much improved by keeping in a cool place for some 
time. 

Puff Paste another way. 

Rub four ounces of butter freely into one pound of flour, 
mix it with as much cold water as will make it a nice spfb 
dough, roll it out, give it five or six folds, then roll it out 
again to a large sheet, and on one side of it spread twelve 
ounces of butter ; cut into small pieces, fold the other side 
over it, and press it round the edge, then roll it out again 
and fold it six times. Put* it in a cool place to firm for 
about half an hour, then roll it out again, and give it four 
folds, when it wiU be finished. German, French, and 
American are the best kinds of flour for making paste.

Sicli Freucli Paste. 

Rub four ounces of salt butter into one pound of flour, 
then take twelve ounces of fresh butter, cut it into small 
pieces, and mix with the flour, being careful to rub it as 
little as possible with the hands. Make a circle in the 
middle of the flour, and into it put the whites of two eggs, 
three ounces of ground sugar, and nearly an English pint 
of cold water ; mix the water, eggs, and sugar together, 
then draw in the flour and butter, and mix all up freely 
and lightly ; roll it out to a large sheet, dusting it occa- 
sionally with flour, to prevent it from sticking to the table 
or roUing-pin, fold it six times, roll it out again, give it 
other four folds, and put it in a cool place to firm it for 
about half an hour. This pastry is generally used for fancy 
dishes, buflt up with barley sugar, and covered with spun 
sugar, in various styles, according to taste. 

Paste for Mutton or Raised Pies. 

Put two pounds of flour with one table-spoonful of salt 
on the table, make a circle in the middle of the flour, and 
into it put six ounces of butter or lard cut into small 
pieces, then pour over the butter rather more than an 
English pint of boiling water ; mix the water with the 
butter till quite dissolved, then knead it all together tiU it 
is very stiff and smooth, adding a little flour occasionally. 
This is a nice paste for raised French pies or venison 
pasties. If salt butter is used, you do not require to put 
salt amongst the flour. 

Paste for covering Yeal or Beef-steak Pies. 

Cut half a pound of butter into small pieces and mix it 
with one pound of flour, make a circle in the middle and 
pour in nearly an English pint of cold water, mix it lightly 



.PUDDINGS. 141 

with the butter and flour, taking care to handle it as little 
as possible. Eoll it out to a large sheet, fold it six times, 
and roll it out again, dusting it occasionally with flour, 
give it other five folds, and put it in a cool place to firm for 
half an hour. This quantity will cover a large dish. 
Banffshire or north-country butter is the best for this 
kind of paste. 

Paste for Bimpliiigs, 

Take half a pound of beef suet, finely minced, one pound 
of flour, a little salt, and mix it with cold water. Work it 
with your hand till it is all wet, then take it and roll it 
out upon the table ; fold it up, and roll it a second time, 
when it will be ready for use. This paste answers for any 
kind of boiled fruit pudding. 

Sweet Paste, 

Take a pound of flour and six ounces of white sugar, 
beat up the whites of two eggs, and mix them all together 
with cold water ; knead it well with your hand until it is 
smooth, divide it into two, and roll out each piece a quarter 
of an inch thick. Take half a pound of fresh butter, roll 
it out the size of the pieces of paste, lay it in between them, 
dust your rolling-pin with flour, press it round the edges 
with your finger to prevent the butter from bursting out, 
roll it out gently, as broad as you can make it, fold up the 
four sides in the centre, double it over, dust your roller 
with flour, roll it out again and give it one fold, and roll it 
out a third time, when it will be ready for any purpose. 

Sweet Paste another way. 

For gooseberry, rhubarb tarts, etc., rub six ounces of 
butter and three ounces of sugar into one pound of flour. 



142 PUDDINGS. 

make it into a dough with cold water, and either roll it 
or knead it till smooth and pretty stiflf, dusting flour on it 
occasionally, to keep it from sticking to the hands or table. 

To make Tartlets. 

Take a piece of puflf or sweet paste, roll it out about a 
quarter of an inch thick ; have a paste cutter a size larger 
than your pattie pans ; cut out a piece of paste, put it 
into the pans and press it down ; put in some small bits 
of bread, press it down at the bottom but not at the sides ; 
put them in a quick oven ; when they are a light brown 
they are done ; take out the piece of bread and fill them 
with jam or jelly. 

Sice Paste. 

Take half a pound of rice flour, rub in a quarter of a 
pound of fresh butter, and one ounce of sugar ; mix it up 
with cold water ; roll it out and dust it with flour ; roll 
out another quarter of a pound of sweet butter, put it 
inside and fold it up ; roll and fold it three times ; dust 
with white flour, cover your tart or pie, and glaze on the 
top with eggs. This does not require a very quick oven. 
It should be used hot, and on the day it is baked. 

To make a Tart of Whole Apples. 

Have a paste case made of puflf paste ; then peel and 
core twelve apples all one size, put them in a syrup made 
of half a pound of sugar and two English pints of water, 
add a little essence of ginger, let them boil slowly till soft, 
but not to break ; then take them out, and arrange taste- 
fully into the case. Eeduce the syrup into a small quan- 
tity, and pour over them. Sprinkle colouring sugar on 
the top of each apple, or cover with a sugar frame ; and

put a small piece of orange-peel into the hole on the top 
of each appla 

Apple Loaf. 

Take a ponnd and a half of apples all one size, pare and 
cut in four and take out the core. Put them in a stew- 
pan with four ounces of fresh butter and half a pound of 
sugar. Let them stew slowly tiU soft, but not to break 
them. Take them out with a spoon and lay them on a 
sieve that the syrup may run from them. When cold, 
season with a little marmalade and cinnamon. Butter a 
pudding-mould well ; with thin slices of bread or finger 
biscuit line the sides and bottom of the mould, lay the 
apples in neatly, cover with slices of bread buttered on 
both sides, brush over with an egg, and bake in a moderate 
oven three-quarters of an hour. Turn it out and serve 
with melted butter and a glass of wine. 



CREAMS AND JELLIES. 

Calf Peet Jelly, 

Take four calves* feet, one ox foot, clean and wash well. 
Cut them up, put them in a clean soup pot, with plenty of 
water, and put them on the fire to boil. Skim it well 
when it comes to the boil ; let them aU boil to rags, run 
it through a sieve, and let it stand till perfectly cold. 
When you are to^ make the jelly, skim off all the fat of 
the stock, then lay a piece of blotting paper or a wet cloth 
to take off every particle of fat. If you find the stock too 
soft, add a little isinglass to it. This quantity of stock 



144 CBEAMS AND JELLIES. 

will make two quarts of jelly. For one quart of jelly, add 
the following :- put the half of the stock in a brass pan ; 
have two lemons, and pare the rind very thin ; squeeze in 
the juice of the two, half an ounce of bark cinnamon, half 
a pound of loaf-sugar, and a few cloves. Beat up the 
whites of six eggs, put them in a pan, break the shells, add 
them also. Put it on a clear fire, shake it, but do not 
stir it, and let it boil slowly ten minutes. Take it off 
and add half a bottle of sherry wine, and put it on the fire 
to make it hot, but do not let it boiL Have the jelly bag 
in hot water, wring it out as hot as your hands can bear 
it, fix it to the jelly stand, pour in the jelly and let it run 
into a basin. Eetum it again into the bag and let it run 
till clear. If you find it is not so transparent as you 
would like, put it in the brass pan, beat up the whites of 
two eggs, put it on the fire, throw in the shells into the 
pan, and let it just boil, then pour it into the jelly bag, 
and let it run till all the jelly is run out of the bag. The 
jelly stands should be kept near the fire and covered over 
with a folded table-cloth. If you wish to make the jelly 
dark, add a glass of brandy ; or colour it by adding a few 
drops of cochineal. Wet a mould with cold water, fill it ; 
when you are to turn it out, dip it in lukewarm water, let 
a little go inside the shape, shake and toss it from side to 
side, pour off the water, put the glass upon the top of the 
mould, turn it up, and let it stand for some time, before 
you draw off the mould. 

To make a Shape of Jelly with G-elatine. 

Dissolve one ounce and a half of gelatine in half an 
English pint of cold water for fifteen minutes ; then add 
one pint of boiling water, put it into the brass pan, beat 
up two eggs with the shells, the rind and juice of one 
lemon, half an oimce of whole cinnamon, half a pound of 



CREAMS AND JELLIES. 145 

loaf-sugar, eighteen cloves, and a small pinch of hay 
safiron, previously soaked in warm water. Put all on the 
fire, stirring it gently, till it boils five minutes, then add 
one gill of sherry wine, and let it come to the boil again, 
then pour into the flannel bag and return it until clear. 

Sponge Jelly. 

For a whole shape, take half a shape of solid jeUy, melt 
it and let it stand till cold but not set ; whisk it up till 
spongy and very light, and pour it into a mould. When 
wanted, turn out into a crystal dish. 

Silver Jelly. 

To make one shape, dissolve a ninepenny package of 
gelatine in a quart of water ; put it on the fire in a brass 
pan, with ten ounces of loaf-sugar, a few drops of the 
essence of cinnamon, the juice of four lemons, and the 
whites and shells of six eggs a little beat up ; stir till it 
boils, then add two wine glasses of milk punch, and run 
through the jelly bag ; if not quite clear, return it to the 
pan with the whites and shells o two eggs, stir gently till 
it boils, and pour again through the jelly bag. When 
cold, but not set, pour into a jelly mould, and turn into a 
crystal dish. 

Yenus Pudding. 

Line a melon mould with calf-feet jelly — this is done 
by pouring in some jelly first, and then put a small oval 
plain mould or basin, within about an inch of the bottom 
of the melon mould, so as to form a space for the pudding 
to be poured in afterwards. Let the jelly come nearly to 
the top of the melon mould. After the smaller one is put 
in, make a blancmange of somewhat less than half a six- 
penny package of gelatine soaked in cold water, boil half

146 CREAMS AND JELLIES. 

an English pint of sweet mUk, the same of cream, and two 
ounces of fine sugar. When it boils, pour it over the 
gelatine, and stir occasionally till cold, but not set, add 
six drops of the essence of ratifia, and eight of the essence 
of cinnamon. Draw out the shape you placed in the 
melon mould, it being imderstood that the jelly is set 
before it is done. It will come out quite easily by pouring 
within the smaller mould a little lukewarm water, then 
put in a few preserved cherries, or small pieces of pre- 
served ginger, with a little of the blancmange, let it set, 
then the preserved fruit again, and so on alternately, till 
you come to the top ; over which pour some calf-feet jelly. 
Let it set, and turn out into a crystal dish, in the same 
way as a jelly. 

To make a Casserole of Prunes. 

Take a pound and a half of prunes, put them into a 
brass pan, cover with cold water, put them on the fire, and 
let them boil for a minute. Take them off, put them into 
a sieve, and run cold water on them, then open up and 
extract the stones, which break, take out the kernels and 
blanch in boiling water for a minute, then take off the 
brown skin. Dissolve haK an ounce of gelatine in an 
English pint of cold water ; put it into a brass pan, with 
four ounces of sugar, let it boil five minutes, colour with 
cochineal, and season with a few drops of essence of ratifia. 
Place the prunes, with a kernel on the outside of each,

To Ixnl or darify Sugar fiir Pi6ser?es. 

Take the quantity of sugar that you wish, put it in a 
clean brass or copper pan, and to each pound allow half 
an English pint of cold water, put it on a stove or quick 
clear fire, and stir it with a spoon so as to make it dissolve, 
which it should do before it conies to boiL When it boils, 
draw it to the side and skim it clean ; if wanted very pure, 
the whites of eggs slightly beaten may be added, allowing 
one to each four pounds of sugar. After the whites of 
eggs have been added, put it again on the fire, let it boil 
a few minutes, then draw it to the side and skim it clean 
a second time, then return to the fire and boil till candy 
high, when it will be ready for the fruit you wish to 
preserve. To know when sugar is boiled to what is called 
candy high, dip a spoon in it, then in cold water, and if it 
adhere to the spoon and feel soft and tough when you 
draw it, it is ready. If wanted for barley-sugar or rock, 
boil it a little longer, till it is quite crisp and breaks freely 
on the spoon when you try it as above. Spun sugar, or 
sugar for ornamenting trifles, is boiled to the same height 
as barley sugar. 

Gringer Tablet. 

Put on in a brass or copper pan three pounds of raw 
sugar, with an English pint of cold water, stir tiU it comes 
to boil. Boil tiU candy high (see Clarified Sv^ar\ then 
take it oflf the fire and stir into it one ounce and a half of 
the finest ground ginger, and keep stirring till you see it 
beginning to get thick. Have a sheet of paper greased 
and laid upon a stone slab, on it place four iron rods, so as 
to form a square, into which pour the tablet, let it stand

until it set, then turn over and draw off the paper, and cut 
into small square pieces. Cinnamon, rose, and lemon 
tablets are made in the same way, by substituting loaf- 
sugar for raw, and the essence for the ground seasoning. 
Bose and cinnamon are coloured with cochineal. 

Cocoa-lfut Ice Tablet. 

Put on in a brass or copper pan four pounds of loaf- 
sugar with two English pints of cold water, stir till it 
comes to the boil, by which time the sugar should be 
quite dissolved, let it boil till candy high, and draw it to 
the side. Have a large cocoa-nut paired and grated, mix 
together with the milk, add three- fourths of it to the sugar, 
and stir till it begins to candy. Have a sheet of paper 
greased and laid upon a stone slab, on it place four iron 
rods so as to form a square, into which pour the tablet. 
Repeat the above process with two pounds of sugar and 
one pint of cold water, adding a little cochineal to colour 
it, and the remainder of the grated cocoa-nut ; when ready, 
pour it over the first sheet of tablet, which will be set by 
the time you have done the second. "When quite cold, 
turn it over, draw off the paper, and cut it in stripes about 
three or four inches long. 

Eyerton Toffee. 

Take six pounds of coarse sugar, put on the fire in a

minutes longer, by which time it should be brittle, which 
you will know by trying a little on a spoon in cold water ; 
then butter a stone or flat dish, pour it out. When haK 
cold, mark on the top like diamonds ; and when quite

make, wipe them well with a clean cloth, and grate any 
discoloured part ; put them in a clean brass pan, with 
plenty of cold water, cover them close, put it on the fire, 
and let them boil for an hour or two. To know when they 
are done, with the head of a pin pierce them ; if it goes 
through the oranges easily, they are done ; if not, boil them 
a little longer ; when they are done, take them out. Keep 
the water in the brass pan, divide the oranges in four, and 
with a knife scrape out all the white, making the skins as 
thin as possible, and so on till you have done the whole of 
the oranges. Cut the skins as thin as possible, two inches 
in length, put all the insides into the pan in which the 
oranges were boiled, and let them boil slowly until you 
have reduced the water to very little, taking care it does 
not bum. Eun it through a sieve, and press it a Uttle with 
a wooden spoon ; take a pound of sugar for each pound of 
oranges, and boil it candy higL Put in the chips, with 
the juice that has run through the sieve, and let it boil for 
fifteen minutes. To know when it is done, take a small 
drop in a saucer, and when cold, if it is thick and does not 
run, it is done ; if it does run, boil it a few minutes mora 
Pot it up. When cold, have some starch made, brush over 
thick paper with it, stick it closely over the pots, and cut 
neatly round the edges. 

Mashed Marmalade. 

Take whatever quantity of oranges you want, wash and 
wipe them, cut them in four over a sieve to preserve the 
juice, and take out the pulp and put the skins on with cold 
water. Cover them closely, and boil them until a pin- 
head will go through them easily. Take them out, scrape

as many pounds of sugar as you have of fruit, boil and 
clarify it, put in the mashed skins, press through all the 
juice with a wooden spoon, add the juice of two lemons, 
put all into a pan, and boil and finish as the above. In- 
stead of mashing, you may mince or grate the orange-peel.

one poimd of loaf-sugar, put it in a large basin, break and 
squeeze all the oranges through a sieve over it ; then put 
all the pulp into a brass pan, just cover it with water, put 
it on the fire, and let it boil for ten minutes, then run 
through the sieve among the sugar. Put it all on the fire

the lemons through a sieve over it, then put all the pulp 
into a brass pan, just cover it with water, put it on the fire 
and let it boil for ten minutes, then run through the sieve 
among the sugar, and press as much as possible through.

Sugar), pour in the juice, and let it boil about ten minutes ; 
then try a little in a saucer, in order to ascertain whether 
it is jellied. 

Black-Gurraiit Jam. 

Gather the black currants when they are dry, and clip 
them. Allow to each pound of fruit a pound of loaf-sugar, 
and to every four pounds allow an English pint of rasp- 
berry juice, adding a pound of sugar for every piat. Have 
the sugar boiled, add the fruit and juice, and boil it fifteen 
minutes ; then pot and finish as above. 

To preserve Black Gurrants for Tarts. 

Gather the currants on a dry day. To every pound of 
fruit, allow half an English pint of rasp and red-currant 
juice, eiip off the heads and stalks of the currants. 
Allow a pound and a half of sugar to each pound of cur- 
rants, and a haK pint of juice. Put them all into a brass 
pan together, and shake it frequently till it boils. Skim it 
clean, and let it boil constantly for fifteen minutes ; then 
take it from the fire, put a piece of muslin over the jelly- 
pot, and with a divider take some of the thinnest of the 
jelly out of the pan, run it through the muslin, fill your 
jelly-pot, and go on filling until the jam comes to a proper 
thickness. This makes beautiful jelly ; the jam answers 
better for roUs, tarts, etc.

pint of juice allow one pound of loaf sugar, clarify it (see 
Clarified Sugar), add the juice, and boil for five minutes ; 
then try a little in a saucer, to ascertain whether it is jeUied. 
Be careful not to boil it too much, as it wiU then be more 
like treacle than jelly. White-currant jelly may be made 
in the same way. 

White-Currant Jelly. 

Gather the fruit on a dry day, pick it from the stai.

through a fine sieve into a clean tub. To every quart allow 
one pound of raw sugar, stir it until it is quite dissolved, 
when you must fill up your cask or casks quite fall, in 
order to increase the fermentation, which may continue 
for six days, stirring and filling up often, daily. When

pounds of sugar, the juice of eighteen lemons,. and one 
pound of ginger are allowed, the sugar and water are boiled 
with the whites of eight eggs, and well skimmed just before 
coming to the boiling point. The ginger, which must be 
bruised, is then added and boUed for twenty minutes. 
When cold, the clear part is put into the cask, together 
with the lemon juice and two spoonfuls of yeast ; when it 
has fermented for three or four days, it is fined, bunged up, 
and in a fortnight bottled. It may be made without the 
fruit. 

Mushroom Powder.

PICKLES, ETC. 213 

them in cold water, drain and put them into a sauce-pan 
with two spoonfuls of white pepper, a quarter of an ounce 
of mace, and five cloves pounded. Simmer and shake them 
till the liquor is wasted away, but be careful that they do 
not burn. Lay them upon dishes and put them into a 
cool oven to dry, then beat them to a powder, put it into 
wide-mouthed bottles, and tie leather over the corks. 
Keep them in a dry place. 

Lemon Fickle, 

Cut into quarters and pick out all the seeds of six 
middling- sized lemons, put them into a jar, strew over

seeds, and one nutmeg sliced. Make a quart of vinegar 
boiling hot, and pour it over the ingredients, cover the 
jar, and in three or four days close it with a bung and tie 
leather over it. It will be fit for use in a week, and is an 
improvement to most sauces, and particularly to fish 
sauce. 

Cuirant Wine, 

To forty pints of currants allow ten pints of water, 
bruise the fruit and lay it on a sieve, pour the water on 
gradually, and squeeze out the stalks and seeds with your 
hand. To every pint of liquor add a pound and a half of 
sugar. The best way to melt your sugar is to reserve a 
little of the water, which you can warm and pour over it, 
stirring all the time, otherwise it is apt to gather into 
knots. Before you bung it up, add a pint of whisky. 
Work it in a tub and take off the scuni.

Sweet Wine from Bipe Currants. 

The fmit is gathered when quite ripe, and the stalks 
being carefully picked out, it is bruised in the hands, and 
then strained through a canvas bag into a ten gallon 
cask. Forty pounds of fruit, thirty of sugar, and a quarter 
of good tartar are allowed ; the materials having remained 
some hours in the tub in which it was mixed, it is removed 
to the cask, the bung hole covered with a tile, and the 
cask is stirred every other day for ten days, and filled up 
every day as the fluid wastes. The fermentation may 
continue from three to six weeks. When it has subsided, 
the wine is racked into a cask, in which matches dipped 
in sulphur have been burned, or in which a little of the 
sulphate of potash, or of oxymuriate of potash has been 
put. It should be again racked and fined in March, when 
the wine is completed, and may be bottled or allowed to 
remain in the cask.

The same varieties of proportions are allowed in this as 
in the others already mentioned. The fruit being picked, 
it is brought to the boiling point, in as much water as to 
avoid any risk of burning. It may then be strained and 
put into the cask, or the liquid and skins may, with the 
other ingredients, be first fermented in the vat or tub, by 
which the wine will acquire a higher colour and flavour. 

Strawberry and Raspberry Wine. 

From either of these fruits, agreeable wine may be ob- 



PICKLES, ETC. 215 

tained, by following the rules given for making currant 
wine ; but it will be found a cheaper and better method 
to add a little syrup or juice of the fruit, to any flavourless 
currant wine, when the fermentation begins to decKne. 
Currant wine may also be flavoured with odoriferous 
flowers, such as cowslip, elder, mignonette ; the quality 
of roughness is communicated by catech and kenochips of 
oak, and of beech, and also the sole, a small quantity of 
these or of the flowers is put into the cask when the first 
fermentation is over, and as soon as the wine has acquired 
the desired flavour it is racked and fined. The flavouring 
articles, such as orisroot, cloves, ginger, sweet and bitter 
almonds, are put into a muslin bag and hung in the cask 
for a few days, during the stage of insensible fermentation, 
that is, after the first fermentation has ceased. • Care being 
taken to taste the liquor frequently, so that the flavouring 
matter is withdrawn as soon as it has produced the desired 
effect. 

Milk Fimcli. 

Put two pounds and a quarter of loaf-sugar into a good- 
sized jar, pour over it two quarts and a half of boiling 
water, and cover it up ; when nearly cold, add the juice of 
twelve lemons, cover up, and let it stand till morning ; 
then add one bottle of whisky, one of pale Jamaica rum, 
and stir it a little. Boil one quart of new milk and pour 
it in, and while doing so, be sure you do not stir it. 
Cover up again, and let it stand till mid-day ; then run 
through a jelly bag, and return, till it come as pure as 
water and bottle it. 

lemon Syrup, 

Squeeze about three dozen of lemons, put the juice into 
a jar, and add to it one quart of cold water previously 



216 PICKLES, ETC. 

acidulated with two ounces and a half of tartaric acid, add 
three pounds of loaf-sugar, and stir occasionally till quite 
dissolved ; pour it through a jelly bag, let it run all night ; 
then bottle it up. 

Wine from Mixed Fruit. 

The three varieties of currants may be used in the 
largest proportions, and being nicely picked from the - 
stalks, they are allowed just to boil in as much as to pre- 
vent their burning. Of raspberries, strawberries, and 
cherries (black heart is the best), equal quantities may be 
allowed ; they are infused with a little water. Goose- 
berries may be used to advantage, but must be prepared 
separately. More powerful bruising in an equal quantity 
of water, and straining through a canvas bag, the other 
fruits being also strained. To each gallon of juice thus 
obtained, four pounds of loaf-sugar and half an ounce of 
crude tartar are allowed. When the material has stood 
some hours in the tub in which it was mixed, it is removed 
to the cask and managed as currant wine. 

Strawkrry Syrup. 

Put twenty-four pounds of strawberries into a jar, and 
pour over them four quarts of spring water previously 
acidulated with ten ounces of tartaric acid. Let them 
remain twenty-four hours, then strain them, taking care 
not to bruise the fruit. To each pint of clear liquor, 
allow one poimd of loaf-sugar ; stir it occasionally. When 
quite dissolved, pour into a well-cleaned cask that will 
just contain it, except about a quart, which must be left 
out for the purpose of filling up, during the process of 
fermentation. When it ceases, bung up, and let it stand 
for two months, when it will be ready for bottling. 



PICKLES, ETC. 217 

Raspberry Syrup, 

Put twenty-four pounds of raspberries into a jar, and 
pour over them four quarts of spring water, previously 
acidulated with ten ounces of tartaric acid. Let them re- 
main twenty-four hours, then strain them, taking care not 
to bruise the fruit. To each pint of clear liquor allow 
one pound of loaf-sugar ; stir it occasionally. When quite 
dissolved, pour it into a well-cleaned cask that will just 
contain it, except about a quart, which must be kept out 
for the purpose of filling up during the process of fermenta- 
tion. When it ceases, bung up, and let it stand for two 
months, when it will be ready for bottling. 

Scourmg Soap. 

Collect into a barrel all the waste grease, whether cooked 
or raw, scrapings of candles, taUow, or wax ; in fact, any 
fat substance, and to every pound of this substance take 
half a pound of black ashes and a quarter of an ounce of 
rosin, put all together into a large pot with as much water 
as you think requisite ; to dissolve these ingredients, a 
choppin to the pound is generally enough, but sometimes 
more requires to be added during the process of boiling, 
which varies in time according as the heat is kept up. 
When you think that all is melted and weU mixed together, 
take out a little and try if it will froth as soap ought to do, 
and if not, it must boil till it does so. The common time 
varies from twenty-four to forty- eight hours. When all is 
ready, pour it into whatever you intend keeping it, while 
hot, and do not cover it up till quite cold. A hot plate is 
preferable to a fire, in case of the inflammable substance 
boiling over, which during the process of melting must be 
frequently stirred, and scraped from the sides of the vessel 
A very small portion of this soap does for use, and is admir- 
ably adapted for scouring unpainted wood, greasy towels, etc. 



218 PICKLES, ETC. 

To make Cocliiiieal. 

Pound half an ounce of cochineal small, and put it on the 
fire with one quart of water. Let it boil for fifteen minutes, 
stirring all the time ; add half an ounce of pounded rock 
alum and one ounce of cream of tartar, and let it come to 
the boil. Take it off, and shake in gently half an ounce of 
salt of tartar ; strain it through a piece of cloth, and bottle 
when cold. If it should ferment, boil it up with a little 
sugar, and pour it through .a bag.
