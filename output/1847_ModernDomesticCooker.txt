As there is scarce an individual who is not aware 
of the camfinrt remlting firom a regular and cleanly 
meal, it may appear to many labour lost, to write a 
preface to a work which is designed to teach n» how 
to prepare snch a repast. 

• But, in the dafly progress of life, we may often dis- 
cover an amiable and accompUshed woman, who pos- 
sesses a general faiowledge^ with the exception of 
domestic cod&ery, which, I must be suffered to remark, 
, is a subjffct of infinitely gceatei^ importaQice' to her than 
superficial acquirements, whether we consider her as 
a dau^ter, wife, or mother. Indeed,, she can never 
be property the mistress of a family, unless she makes 
herself acquainted with its interior economy. 

Exclusive of the necessity of such knowledge, it is 
surprising, how much such a woman, possessed of it, 
m*y WKve in the yearly expenditure of hey fipnlly, 
which, in the present times, is an object of material 
importance to all persons of moderate incomes, fer 
whom this book is peeuUarly adapted, combining eco- 
nomy and .gentility in its receipts and directions.

MANAGEMENT OF A FAMILY. 



All persons sbould endeavour to diwhorge tiM dhitiM of the 8f»- 
tionliiejmay fill, soas toclaimtherespociof tlMiroompoora; and 
ajSbrd a beneficial example to ihe joiungor hfanciwi of aod o t y : to 
such as are desirous of respect, this mode of conduet ia « matter of 
-necessity, the neglect of which no ezcuao can eztemiate. 

The accomplishments proper for the female character, are not so 
serioosly attended to as formerly, when all persona, wkaterer might 
t>e dieir rank, were studious to render themaehrea uaoM. Yet do- 
oiestic ocenpationa should never for one nKMDent bo ooglooted, aa 
auch neglect must produce mis^^ and may, perhapa, ultimately ter- 
minate in ruin. At no very distant period, ladies loiew but Kttie be- 
yond their own family concerns ; now, alas 1 theie are few things 
«f which they know so little. Viewed either way, tlus ia foaoing into 
extremes, which should be carefully avoided, beeauae elegant ac- 
quirements may, with some little care, be easily united with useful 
knowledge, and without which they become ridiculoua. That this 
may be done, we have numerous exao^ples, even an the most ele* 
vated ranks of society, in which the znistiesa of a family, possessed of 
every possible femimne accomplishment, may be frequently seen 
superintending her family arrangements, mvestigating her aocoonts, 
instructing her servants, and keeping witbiathe boimds of her hus- 
band's income ; by such means, reflectipg credit en him, as weU as 
lierselfl - 

If such minute attention to domestic conceraamfleots hofl0ar upon 
females of elevated rank, at the same time thai it is useftd to them, 
how much more therefore must it be beneficial U> such as possess 
contracted incomes, and whocan only aupport aa elegant, nay even a 
neat appearance, by exertmg the most rigid economy^ and attentive* 
iy directing their efibrts to the proper management of their domestb 
affairs. • * 

Females should be early taught to prefer the society of thehr homes, 
to engage themselves in domestic duties, and to avoid every species 
of idle vanity, to which thousands of them owe their ruin ; and, above 
ail things, to consider their parents as their best friends, wUo are ij»- 
lerested only Ih their welfare ; then mdeed we m^it hojffii to see all ,

ash should be, and to have daily evidence of real comfort and bftp- 
piness. Were Uf9¥ft0$ .tiaia.Mibraetod) ik!&y wotdd eoon leain to 
discriminate between the solid enjoyments of domestic peace, and" 
the fleeting piiantoms of delusive pleasure. 

It is natural to iiaagine, that "wi^x a female manias, she does so 
from a. ptiaeipai of love. It most surely, therefore, be admitted, that 
her duties then become still mQTS seriously important, because hei 
station is more responsible than it previously was. She will then 
^ve tp superintend the niSska^ihe man with whose destiny she has 
Ufllt^d hoc pw&; die d^nnestie part of which falls particulariy within . 
t)ie 9|4»^SL of her management; and the duties of which she ought 
aotiyely to execute^ and at the same ^me to support as neat an^ 
elegant an appeaeaace as is consistent with prudent economy ; with* 
ou^ which even princ^y fortunes must fail ; in which case, her bus* 
band will soon discover her merits, and {^ace. a proper value on the 
treasure. he possesses; 

A person who desires to please, will seldom fail to do so. This 
conviction should of ilsetf be sufiicient to stimulate to the attempt, 
as domestic knowledge in a female is of more real importance than 
vain acquirements, not that accomplishments, when properly direct* 
ed, are incompatible with domestic duties ; on the contrary^ they, 
become intimately comMned with them, because they add to the rst* 
ttonal enjoyments of- that home «4iicb should ever be the centre oi 
attraction^ to the husband, to her children, and others connected with 
it ; and this is what an ignorant^ ubsocial, and unaccomplished woman, 
can never vefader it. It is the abuse of things from which alpiM), 
mischief can originate, not from the temperate use of them. 

The donwstic anrangements of ^a &nuly belonging ent,ire}y. to. the 
female, thetable^ of course, becomes entitled to np small sharp ol^ 
her attention^in respect to its expenditure, appearance, and genreralt 
supplies* 

Taste and judgment are highly requisite in il^s department, U^- 
cause the credit of keeping a good ami respectable table depends 
not (as of old) on die vast quantity of articles with which it is cover-. 
ei, but the neatnes^, propriety, and cleanliness, in which the whole is. 
served up, wfaieh ak>ne can confer real credit, on her who directs th^ 
prepasation* 

Dinner parties ar4 very expensive, and certainly fall very heavy on 
poEsons whose incomes are moderate ; such persons, therefore, 
i^uld not support a custom productive of unpleasant consequences, 
by lending it the sanction of their example. But if it is found requi> 
site occass4»nally to give, dinners, it should be done in a liberal and 
gonteei miluoer> otherwise it is far better to decline it altogether.

12 SOTTPS. 

you have taken in this first degree of care will be am- 
ply repaid by the articles you cook being, if properly 
managed according to the rules here laid down, teotrght 
, to table in the highest state of perfection. 

jLs a necessary prelude to the making of soups and 
bi-oths, we shall introduce a few general observations ; 
which we . recommend as deserving the particular 
notice and attention of -the cook. - 

When you make any kinds of soups, more especi- 
ally portable, vermicelli, or brown gravy soup, or, 
indeed, any other that hath roots or herbs in it, always 
observe to lay the meat at the bottom of your pan, 
with a good lump of butter. Cut the herbs and roots 
small, lay them over the meat, cover it close, and set 
it over a jilow fire: this will draw all the virtue out of 
the roots or herbs, turn it to a good gravy, and give 
,the soup a different flavour from what it would have 
on putting the water in at first. As soon as you find 
the gravy is nearly dried up, then fill the saucepan 
with water, and when it begins to boil skim off the fat, 
and pursue the directions given fi^r the squji intended 
to be made. In making peas soup observe, that if 
they sure old, you must use soft water; but if green, 
hard or spring water, as it will greatly contribute to 
the preservation of their colour, One principal thing 
to be observed in makii^ all kinds of soup is, that no 
one ingredient is more powei^ul in the taste than an- 
otiier, but that all are as nearly as possible equal, and 
that the soup be relisheid in proportion to the purpose 
for which it is designed. 

Vermicelli Soup. 

Take a knuckle 6( veal and a scrag of mutton, Gxyvgi 
each of which cut the flesh into small pieces about tl# 
size of walnuts, and mix th^n. together, with five w 
six thin slices of lean ham. Put into the bottom (^ 
your pan about foui; ounces of butter, and then yotfr 
meat; to wiiich add three or four blades of mace, two 
or three carrots, two parsnips, two large onions, -^SSr 
• a elove stuck on both «ides of each, eat m four or H^' 



suvra. 13 

heads of celery washed dean, a hunch dfpweet herbs, 
eight or ten morels, and an anehovy. When yont 
articles>re thus prepared and mixed together in the 
pan, cover it very ckwe, and set it over a slow fire, 
without any water, till the gravy is drawn ont of the 
meat. When this is done, pour it out into a pot or 
large basin; then let the meat brown, (taking care that 
it does not bum,) and pot into the saucepan four quarts 
of wat^. Let the whole boil gently till it is wasted 
to three {unts, then strain it, and mix with it the first 
gravy drawn fit>m the meat. Set it on the fire, and 
add two ounces of vermicelli, a nice head of celery cut 
small, chyan pepper and salt to your taste, and let the 
whole boil about six minutes. Lay a small French 
toil in the soup dish> pour the soup upon it, strew 
some of the vermiceUi on the surface, and then ser\e 
it to table. 

VermiceUi Soup White. 
Wash your vermicelli in boiling water, and leave 
it to drain on a sieve that it may not lump : boil it with 
some good gravy soup ; and the moment before serving 
it upv put in a cullis a-la^reine, or the yolks of sOme 
eggs beat up witii cream or milk. It must fiot boil 
afta the eggs are in, or else it will curdle. 

Soup a-la-Reine. 
Take a knuckle of veal, and tliree or four pounds 
of lean beef, to which put in six quarts of water, with 
a little salt. When it boils take off the scum quite 
clean, then put in six large onions, two carrots, a head- 
or two of celery, a parsnip, one leek, and a little thyme. 
^Let the whole stew together till the meat is quite 
boiled down, then strain it through a hair sieve, and 
after it has stood about half an hour, skim it well, and 
dear it off gently firom the settlings into a clean pan.. 
Boil half a pint of cream, and pour it on the crumb of 
a smi£ loat till the whole is soaked in. Take half a 
pound of almonds, blanch and beat them ds fine as 
possible, putting in now and then a little cream topre- ' 
vent th^n firom oiling. Then take the yolks / or six 



hard €f|g9> btot them with a k>lif soaked M the cifeatii, 
and mix t^e whole tc^tfaer. Put yow broth in again 
into the sauGepan, and when hot pour it to'^your al- 
monds* Strain it through a fine hair sieve, rubbing it 
with a spoon till all the virtue and flavour are extracted. 
Put the whole into the saucepan^ adding a little more 
cream to make it white. Set it over the fire, keep 
stirring it till it boils» and skks off th^ fi*otii as it rise». 
In the me^time soak the tops of ttrd Frendi rolls in 
melted butter in a ^w-pan tiH they Ate m^, btrt not 
brown ; then take them out of the butter, and lay them 
in a plate befwe the fire. After remaiakig there a short 
time put them at the boktoto of the tureen, pouring to

your tureen, and serve it to table. 

Mutton Br0tk. 

Take a neck of mutton about sik pounds, cut it in 
two, boil the scrag part in a gallon of water, skim it 
well^ and then put in a small bundle of swjeet herbs, an 
onion, and a good crust of bread. When the scr£^ 
has boiled about an hour, put in the other part of the 
mutton, and about a quarter of an hour before the meat 
is done, put in a turnip or two^ some dried marigolds, 
a few cJbdves^ with parsley chopped small, and sea^n 
it with salt. You may at first put in a quarter of a 
pound of barley or rice, which both thickens and con- 
tributes a grateful flavour. Some, like it thickened 
Avith oatmeal, and some with bread ; and, instead o! 
sweet herbs and onions, season it with mace : but this 
is a mere fancy, and determined by the different palates 
of different people. If you boil turnips, aA sauce to the 
meat let it be done by themselves,, otherwise the^- 
vour, by beii^ teo powerful, will injure the broth. 

. Beef Broth. 

Take a leg of beef with the bone well cracked, 
wash it thoroughly clean, and put it into your pot with 
a gallon of water. Scum it well, and put in two or 
three blades of mace, a small bunch of parsley, and a 
large crast of bread. Let it boil till the beef and 
sinews are q^uSfce tender. Cut some toasted bread 
and put into your tmieen. then lay in the meat, and 
pom* the soup aU over.

SOUPS. 



Beef Drink. 
Take a pmind ^d a half of lean beef, cut it into 
small pieces, and put it into a gallon of water, with the 
under crast of a penny loaf, and a little salt. Let it 
boil till it is reduced to two quarts, then strain it off, 
and it will be very good drink. — Observe, when you 
first put the meat into the^ water, that it is dear of all 
skin and fat. 

Strong Beef Broth to keep. 

Take part of a leg of beef, and the scrag end of a 
neck of mutton. Break the bones well of each, and put 
to it als much water as will cover it, with a little salt. 
When it boils skim it clean, and put to it a large onion 
stuck with cloves, a bunch of sweet herbs, some pep- 
per; and a nutmeg quartered. Let these boil till the 
virtues of the mace are drawn put, then strain the soup 
through a fine sieve, and keep it for use. 

Veal Broth. 
Stew a knuckle of veal in about agaUon of water, 
put in two ounces of rice or vermicelli, a little salt, and 
a^ blade of mace. When the mea^t is thoroughly boiled, 
and the liquor reduced to about one half, it wifl be very 
good and fit for use. 

Chicken Broth. 
Skin a large old fowl, cut off the fat, break the 
fowl to pieces, and jmt it into two quarts of water, 
with a good crust ofbread, and a blade of mace. Lfet 
it boil gently five or six hours : then pour off all the li- 
quor, put a quart more of boiling water to it, and cover 
it close; let it boil softly till it is good, then strain it 
off, and season it with a Uttle^salt. In the meantime 
boil a chicken, and save the liquor ; and when the flesh 
is eat, take the bones, break them, and put them in the 
liquor in which you boiled the chicken, with a blade 
of mace, and a crust of bread. When the juice ef the 
bones is extracted, strain it off, mix it with the other 
liquor, and send it to table. 



spring Broth. 
Take a crast of bread, and aboat a quarter of a 
potuid of fresh batter; pat them into a soap-pot or 
stew-pan, with a good qaantity of herbs, as bear, sor- 
rel, chervil, lettaee, leeks, and porslain, all washed 
clean, and coarsely chopped. Pat to th^ a qaart of 
water, and let them stew till it is redaced to one half, 
when it will be fit for ase. ' This is an excellent puri- 
fier of the blood. 

Pltftn Porridge to keep. 
Take a 1^ and shin of beef, pot them mto eight 
gallons of water, and boil them till the meat is quite ^ 
tender. When the broth is strong, strain it off, shake * 
oat the meat, an4 pat the broth again into the pot. - 
Slice six penny loaves thin, catting off the tops and 
bottoms^ pat some of the liqaor to them, cover them 
over, and let them soak for a qaarter of an hoar : then 
boil and strain it, and put it into your pot. When the 
whole has boiled a slM)rt time, put in five pounds of 
stewed raisins of the sun, and two pounds of prunes. 
After it has boiled a quarter of an hour, put in five 
pounds of currant^ idean washed and picked. Let 
these boil till they swell, and then put in three quaf- 
ters of an ounce of mace, half an ounce of cloves, and 
two nutm^s, all beat fine. Before you put these into 
the pot, mix them with a little cold liqaor, and put 
them in but a short time before the whole is dooe. 
Whai you take off the pot, put in three pounds of 
sug^r, a little salt, a quart of sack, a. quart of claret, 
and the juice of two or three lemons. If you think 
{NToper, instead of Inread, you may thicken it with sago. 
Pour your porridge into earthen pans, and keep it for 
use. 

Mock Turtle Soup. 

Scald a calf's head with the skin on, and take off 
the homy part, which must be cut into pieces about 
two Tncbtes square. Let these be well washed and 
cleaned, then dry them in a cfetii, and put them into a 
stew-pan, viith four quarts c^ water made as foUows : 



9D iiouM. 

Take six or^even pounds Q£het% a calf 's foot, a shanjc 
of hsMii, an oaion» two carrots, a torn^, «a head of ce- 
lery, swaae cloves and whole pe^)er, a 4oBch^f sweet 
herbs, a little demon-peel, aad a few larufBes. Put 
these kito eight qusfftsof wiiter, aod let it stew gently 
tin the broth is rediiced one half; then ^aim it oSy and 
put it into ttte stew-paaa, with the homy parts oif the 
eaif *s head. Add some knotted man^nMi, a little 
savory, thyme, and parsley, all chopped smaU together, 
with some cloves and tnace pomided, a little chyan 
pepper, some green onions, a shalot cut fine, a few 
chopped nmstrooras, and half a pint of Madeira wine. 
Stew all these together gently ttHthe «oup is reduced 
to two quarts ; then heat a little broth, mix soraefloar 
smooth in it, wifli the yolks of two eggs, and keep it 
stirring over a gentle fire till it is near boiling. Add 
this to the soup, keeping it stirring as you po«r it in, 
and let them all stew togettier for anotSier hour. When 
you take it oflF the fire, sqi^ze in the juice of Tialf a 
lemon, and half an orange, and throw in some bmled 
force-meat baHs. Pour tiie whole into your tureen, 
and serve it up hot to table. This is a ritefe •soup, and 
to most palates deliriously gratifyii^. 

Portoibie Soup. 

This soup (whidi is partieulaily ealciflated for the 
use and convenience of ti'avelers, from its not receiv- 
ing any injury by time,) mcnrt be made in ilbe following 
manner. Cut into small pieces three large legs of veal, 
one of beef, and the lean part of a ham. Put a qiaar- 
ter of a pound of butter at the bottom of a large cal- 
dron, then lay in the meat and bones, witfi four ounces 
of anchovies, and two oi;inces of mace. Ctit off the 
green leaves of five or six heads of celery, wash the 
heads quite clean, cut them small, put them in with 
three large cairots cat thin, cover tbe caldron quite 
close, and set it over amodeorate fire. When you find 
the gravy begins to draw, keep taking it up till you 
have got it all out ; then :pat water in to cover the 
meai; set it on the fire agaizii and let it boil g^tly for 



•ours. 31 

fyor bonis; then strain it throng a hair sieve into a 
cdean pan, till it is reduced to one part oat of three. 
Strain the gravy you draw fix>m the meat into the pan, 
and let it toil gently till you find it of a glutinous con- 
sistence, observing to keep skimming off the fat clean 
as It rises. You must take particular care, when it is 
nearly enough, that it does not bum. Season it to your 
taste with chyan pepper, and pour it on flat earthen 
dishes a quarter oi an inch thick. Let it stand till the 
next day, and then cut it out by round tins a little 
larger than a crown piece. Lay the cakes in dishes, 
and set them in the sun to dry, to facilitate which turn 
them often. When the cakes are dry, put them inti> 
a tin box, with a piece of clean white paper between, 
e^^ch, and keep them in a dry place. If made in frosty 
weather, it will be sooner formed in its proper solidity. 
This soup is not only particularly useful to travellers, 
but it is also exceeding convenient to be kept in private 
families; for by putting one of the cakes into a sauc<.»- 
pan, with, about a pint of Water, and a little salt, a 
basin of 'good broth may be had in a few minutes. 
There is also another great convenience in it ; that by 
boiling a small quanjtitv of water with one of the cakes, 
it will make an excellent gravy for roast turkeys and 
fowls.

BUTCHER^S MEAT. 

AS a necesssoy prdnde to the direjetions given under 
this head, we shall make a few nece^axy and gencrsU 
observations. All meat should be boiled as ^pw as 
possible, but in plenty of water, which will joaakc it 
rise and look plump. Be careful to keep it cl^iar from 
scum, and let your pot be close joc)y«:ejl If fQU boil 
it fast, the outside will be ^^dened before the inside is 
V arm, and the meat will he disagreeably discoloured. 
A leg of veil of twelve pounds weight, will take three 
•'hours and a half boiling; and the slower ^t bpils the 
whiter and plumper it will be. 

With respect to mutton and beef,, if thw are rather 
under done, they may be ate without £eing either 
disagreeable or unwholesome; but Iamb, ppiit, And 
veal, should be thoroughly done, otherwise, they will 
be obnoxious to the sight, and consequently ungrate- 
ful to the palate. A leg of pork will take half an 
hour's more boiling than a leg of veal of the same 
weight; but in general, when you bdil beef and mut- 
ton, you may allow as many quarters of an hour as the 
meat weighs pounds. To put in the meat when the 
water is cold must be allowed to be the best method, 
as thereby the middle gets warm before the outside 
becomes hardened. Three quarters of an hour will 
boil a leg of lamb four pounds and a half weight. 
From these general dh-e^tions, it would be unneces- 
sary to describe the usual mode of boiling the common 
joints of either mutton or beef. We shaU therefore 
proceed to those articles which require more particu- 
lar notice. 



BOILIHO HBAT, 4<* 83

Aftb& haviog ¥Pcfl deamed &e head, parboil one

a dish. Boil the brains in iapjeoemd^an ohrih, <v^^ 
a vCTy Ifttle parsley, and aJeaf or two of sage. When 
they are boiled clK)p them smaiD, and warm them up 
in a saucepan, with a bit of butter, and a litdepepper 
and salt. Lay the tongue, boiled and peeled, in the 
middle of a smafi djish, and the brains round it ; have 
in anotiier dish, bacon or pickled pork; and in a third, 
greens and carrots. 

Gra$s JLamb. 

Wh ATfiVBR the mmiber4if pMnds is that the joint 
we^^ so mngiy quarters of an how mnst it boil. 
Wt^n done, s^rve it up with apinach, carrots, cab- 
bage, or broocdi. 

Put your ham into aoopper of cold w^ter^ and when 
it boSte tafee care that it boils $lowly . A ham of twen- 
ty poinds weight will take four hours and a half boil- 
ing; and so in proportion for one of a largeroi^ smaller 
size. An old and large ham will requn-e sixteen hours 
soaking in a Jarge tub of soft water ; but a green one 
does not require any soaking. Be sure, wMIe yoM ham 
is boiling, to keep the' water clear fiom scum* When 
you take it up, pull off ttie skin, and rob it all over wWi 
aDL egg, strew on carumbs-dT bread, baste it with a little 
butter, and set it to the fire till it is of a light brown. 

With respfect to its being an old ham, or a green 
one, observe the before-mentioned (tireetions. Vpre it 
round and undenieaith, taking oare no (rusty pa^ i» left. 
Put it into a pan or peit that will proper^ ^wntain it.

eovepr it witb water, aiid put in a few dcwei^ .thpaei» 
and laurel leaves. Let it boil on a slow fire about five 
hours, and thea add a glass of brandy, and a pint of red 
wine: finish boilii^ in the same manner. Ii itis to be 
served up hot, take off the skin, and throw it Qver with 
crumbs thread, a little parsley finely chopped, and a 
few bits of batter, and give it a good colmir either in 
the oven, or with a salamander. If it is tabe kept 
cold, it will be better to let the skin remain, as it wljl 
be a means of pres^rving.its juices. 

Ham a-^la-Braise. 
Pare your ham round and underneath, taking care 
no rusty part is left ; cover it well with meat under 
and overi. with roots and spices, filling it up with water. 
The gravy that comes firom the ham being excellent 
for all kinds of brown sauces. 

Tongues, 
If it be a dried toi^e, steep it all ni^ in water; 
but if it be a pkkled one, only wash it well firom the 
brine. Let it boil moderately three hwrs. If it is to 
be eat hot, stick it with cloves, rub it over with the 
yolk of an egg, strew cnmibled bread over it, and, 
when d6ne, baste it with butter, and set it before the 
fire till it becomes c^a light brown. Dish it up wil^L 
a little brown gravy, or red vnne sauce, and lay dices 
of cmrant jelly round the dish. 

JSeafs Tongue, with Parsley. 
Bqjl it a quarter of an hour, then take it out, and 
lard it ; put it in again to boil with any meat you have 
going on ; when it is done, take the sMn off, cut almost 
half through the middle lengthwise, that it may open 
in two parts, without the pieces coming apart, and 
serve it up with some gravy, pepper, and parsley shred 
fine. If you wish you may add a dwh ofl^mon-juice. 

Leg of Mutton, with Cauliflowers and Spinach. 
Take a leg of mutton, cut venison fashion, and boil 
it in a cloth. Boil two fiine cauliflowers in milk and 



mmfLJi 4»c. 95 



wftter, .poH then into aprigs, and ( 
ter, pepper, sail;, and a litHe milk : stew .Mtte fpinaeh 
in a saucepan, aad out to it a quarter ef a pint vt 
gravy, with a pieoe m bottar, and a little flour. When 
all is done, put the mutton in the midtfle of tbe QiA^ 
the spinach round it, and the cauliflower over all. The 
butter the cauliflower was stewed in must be poured 
orer it, and it must be made to appear like smooth 
cream. 

Lamh^s Head, 
Wash the head very dean* take the black part from 
the eyes, and the gall from tiiie liver. X«ay the head 
in warm wat^ ; boil the lights, heaurt, and part of the 
liver. Chop and flour them, and toss them up in a 
saucepan with some gravy, catchup, and a little pep- 
per, salt, lemon-juice, and a spoonral of cream. Boil 
the head very white, lay it in the middle of the dish, 
and the minc&^mest round it. Plaee the either parts 
of the liver fried, with some very smaM Uti ^ baoou 
OH the mince^tneat, asHi tiie brains fited m little cakes 
^uodlaidofntherinofthedirii, with some crisped pavs- 
ley pat between. Pcrar a little melted hotter «ver the 
head^ and ganush with lemon. 

Or you may4pese it thus: 
Boil the head and pinck tendear, but do not let the 
liver J)e too much done. Take thft head up, hack it 
cross and cross with a knife, grate jome nutmeg over 
it, and lay it in a dkih before a good &:!e. Thengrate 
some crumbs of bread, some swed^ herbs nibb^, a 
little lanon-'peel choked fine, a very httle pepper and 
salt, and baste it with a littio butter ; then throw a 
little flour over it, and |u^t as it is done do the same, 
baste and dredge it. Take half the liver, the heart* 
the lights, and tongue vcl|o|i tliem very small, with 
about a giU. of gravy or water* First shake some flom* 
Qverthe meat, and stir it together, then put in the ^avy 
or water a good piece ei butter rolled in a little iflour, 
a little pepper ajafd salt, and what runs &mH die h6a4 
m the dish. Simmer all together a &w joonirtea.

add half a spoonM of vin^ar ; panr it into yoor disli, 
lay the head in the middle of the inince**meat> have 
ready the other half of the live? cut thin with some 
slices of bacon broiled, and lay ronnd the head. Gar- 
nish with lemon. 

Leg of Lamb boiled y and Loin fried. 
Cut yoiu* leg from the loin, and boil it three quar- 
ters of an hour. Cut the loin in handsome steaks, 
beat them with a cleaver, and fry them a good brown. 
Then stew them a little in strong gravy. Put your 
1^ on the dish, and lay your steaks round it. !roin* 
on youi* gravy, lay round lumps of staved spinach 
and crisped parsley on every steak. Send it to table 
with gooseberry sauce in a boat, and garnish with leinon. 

Jl Haunch or Neck of Venison. 

As a necessaiy preparation for either of these joints, 
let it lie* in salt tox a week ; then boil it in a cloth well 
floured, and allow a quarter of an hour's boiling for 
every pound it weighs. For sauce, boil some cauli- 
flowers, pulled into Uttle sprigs^ in some milk and wa- 
ter, with some fine white cabbage, and turnips cut in 
dice ; add some beet-root cut into narrow pieces about 
an inch and a half long, and half an inch thick. After 
your cabbage is boiled, beat it up in a saucepai;! with 
a piece of butter and salt. When your meat is done, 
and laid in the dish, put the cabbage next the cauli- 
flower, and then the turnips. Place the beet-root here 
and there, according to your fancy ; and have a little 
melted butter in a cup, in case it should be wanted. 
This dish is not only excellent in its quality, but par- 
ti<mlarly pleasing in its appearance. If any is left, it 
will eat well the next day, ha^ed 'with gravy and 
sweet sauce. , 

PicJded Pork. 

After washing and scraping it perfectly clean, put 
it into the pot with thle water cold, and when the rind 
feels tender, it is enough. The general sauce is greens,* 
among the variety of which you are to make choice to 
jcMsr own dkeetioii. 



MSAT» 4*^. 37 

Fi^s Pettitoes. 
Boii« tiie feet till tiliey are quite tender, but take up 
the heart, liver, and li^ts, when they have boiled ten 
minutes, and ^ed them small. Then take oat the 
feet and spUt them ; thicken your gravy with flonr and 
batter, and pcut in jonr mince-meat, a spoonful of 
white wine, a sUceof lemim, a Uttle salt, and give it a 
gentle boil. Beat the yolk of an egg ; put to it two 
spoonsful of cream, and a Uttle grated nutmeg. Then 
put in the pettitoes, and shake it over the fire till it is 
qaite hot, but do not let it bcnL Put irippets into the 
dish, pour over the whole, and garnish with sliced 
lemon. 



SECT. II. 
BOILING POULTRY. 

Turkeys. 

A Turkey should not be dressed till three or four 
days after being killed, as it will otherwise not boil 
white, neither will it eat tender. When you have 
plucked it, draw it at the ramp, eat off the legs, put the 
ends of the thighs into tiie body, and lie them with a 
staring. Having cut off the head and nedc, grate a pen-, 
ny loaC chop fine about a score of oysters, sliced a Uttle 
lemon*peel, and put in a sufficient quantity of salt, pep- 
per, and nutmeg. Mix these up into a lig^t force- 
meat, with a quarter of a pound of batter, thi*ee eggs, 
and a spoonful or two of cream. Stuff the craw of the 
turkey with one pairt of this composition; the other 
must be made into balls, and boiled. Wh«i you have 
sewed up the turkey, and dredged it with flour, put it 
into a kettle of cold water ; cover it dose, set it over 
the fij*e, and when the scum begins to rise, take^ it clean 
off, and then cover the kettle close. If a young one ol 
a moderate size, let it boil very slowly for half an hoisr ; 
th^n ts^e off your kettle, and let it stand for some tiiiie' *

of the celery 'into pieces about an inch in length, and 
boil it in some watar HBxHf is tendej* Then take haji

y^u mp9t h4ve made veady in iSie following-manner : . 

Takfi tiie headland neckd of the chickens, with a 
small }M of seirag of veal, or any scraps of mutton you 
miay b»fre hj. you^ and pat thom into a saucepan, with 
a 14ade <h; t990 of mace, and a few Miack peppercorns,

Pot in your 8aiiee» a«d ke^ shakJog it over the lire till 
it is near fainling; then poor it into your hoala, and 
8c;nre itt^ with yow chiokew. 

Powls. 

After having drawn your fowls, whidi you must 
be particularly careful in doing, cutoff the head, neck, 
and legs. Skewey them with the ends of Uidr Ic^ in 
tfaeii' bodies, «id lie them round with a string. Singe 
and dust them well with flour, put them into cold wa- 
ter, cover the kettle dose, and det it on the fire ; bat 
take it <^ as soon as the scum begins to rise. Cover 
them ckise again, and let them boU gently twenty mi- 
nutes; thmi take thMi off, and the heat of the water 
will do them sufficiently. Melted butter with pars- 
ley shred fine is the usual sauce, but you may serve 
them ^p with the like sauce as before doreeted for 
chickens. ^ 

Rabbits or JDucki. 

Boil your dock or rabbit in a good deal of water, 
and wtfen the scum riaes take it dean off. A duck will 
take about twenty minutes, and a rabbit half an how. 
Melted bul^^r and pavsley is fi:equently used as sauce 
for rabbits; but if you prii^ ^nion sance^ which will 
do for either^ make it tbua: Peel your <»noBS, and 
throw them totoi water a^ yon peel them ; then eat 
them into thin slices, boil them in nulk and water, and 
scum the liquor. About half an hour will bqil Ihem. 
When th^ aM soffidently Iboiled, put them into II dM 
sieve to drain; chop them^ and r^ tiiem throc^h ft 
ccriiender; then put ^m into a souoepai^, and shake

must pluck out tlie. jaw-bones, and stick one in each 
eye, the small end inwards . . 

Another sauce for a boiled dudi: may be.made thus : 
Take a lai^e onion, a handful: of parsley clean washed 
^nd picked, ai»l a lettuoei;. cut <the onion small, chop 
the parsley fine, and put them into a t)uarter of a pint 
of good gpravy, with a spoonful of lemonTjuice^ and a 
Uttle pepper and salt. When they have stewed to • 
gether half an hour, add two spoonsful of red wine. 
Lay the duck in your dish, and pour the sauce over it. 

Pigeons.

Pheasants. 
These most be likewise boiled in plenty of water. 
If it be a small one, half '^tn honr wiH be somcient, but 
if a large one, three quarters. For sauce, stew some 
heads of celery cut very fine, thickened with cream, 
and a small piece of butter rolled in flour, and season 
with salt to your palate. When yoiu* bird is done, 
|K>ur the sauce over it, and garnish the dish with thin 
slices of lemon. 

Sn^fpes or Woodcocks. 

Snipes or Woodcocks must be boiled in good 
strong broth, or beef gravy, which you must make as 
follows : Cut a pound of lean beef into small pieces, 
and put it into four quarts of water, with an onion, a 
bundle of sweet herbs, a blade or two of niace, six 
cloves, and some whole pciq)er! . Cpver it close, let it 
boil tin it is half wasted, then strain' it off, and put the 
gravy into a saucepan, with salt enough to season it 
Draw the birds clean, but t^^ particular care of the 
guts. Put Uie birds into the gravy, cover them close, 
and ten minutes will boil them. In the meantime cut 
the guts and liver small, then/take a little of the gravy 
the birds are boiling in, and stew the guts in it with 
a blade of mace. Take about as much of the crumb 
of bread as' the inside of a roll, and rub or grate it 
very smaU into a deistti cloth, then put into a pan 
with some batter, and icy it till crisp, and of a fine 
light brown colour; • Wheii your birds are ready, take 
about half a pint of the liquor they were boiled in, 
and add to the guts two spoonsful of red wine, and 
a piece of butter about l^etjize of a walnut, rolled iu; 
flour. Set them on the fire, and shake your saucepan 
often, (but by no nieans stir it with a spoon,) till the 
butter is melted ; then put in the firied crumbs, give 
the saucepan another shake, take up your birds, lay . 
them in the dish, and pour your sauce over them 
Garnish with sliced lemon.

£h^ you pot it iilto the gravy. Set it on a dow fire about 
a quarter of an hour, and tmcken the sanee with a large 
piece of butter rdled in flour ; or you may make your 
sauce thus : take the liver of the carp clean fiom the 
guts, three anchovies, a little parsley, tfiyme, and an 
on^n. Chop these small together, and take half a pint of 
Rhenish wine, four spoonsful of vine^u*» and the Mood 
of the carp. When all these are stewed gently together,

time, put them into a dish, and strain the sauce over 
them. You may add shrimp or oyster-sauice according 
to your discretion* 

GtTT and wash them clean,, then dry them m a dotfi, 
and rub tiiem gently over with vinegar. Lay fhem 
strait on your fiiSi plate, and* be very cardul in handling 
them, as they are so tender a fish that they will easily 
break. When the watarboik, put them into your fish- 
pan with a little salt, and let than boil gently about a 
quarter of an hour. When you take them up, drain 
fcem well, and put the water that rtms firom thcan into

lay them on your fish plate. When therwater boils, put 
them in, and £tJ)out ten or twelve minutes will do them* 
After you have taken them up, liet than drain properly^ 
and then turn their heads into the middle of the dish. 
Serve them up with jnelted butter and parsley, andgar^

As the similarity of these fish is so great,' the me- 
thod of dressing either must be the Same. Fkst cut off

Perch. 

Put your fish into the water when it boils, with some 
salt, an onion cut in sKces, some parsley, and as much

with the parsley and onions over it. Serve it up with 
melted butter and par^y in a boat ' ' '* * 



After skinning, gutting, and properly washing 
tbem, cutoflf their heads, Acy them, and twist them 
roanrd on your fish plate. Boil them in.salt and water, 
and serve them up with melted butter and parsley. If 
you only boil them in such a quantity ofViater as will 
jast cover them, the liquor will be exceeding good, and 
very benefidal to weak or consumptive constitutions. 

Sturgeon. 

Whb w you have cleaned your feh properly, prepare 
as much bqmnr as will boil it in the blowing manner : 
To two quarts of vwrter put a pint of vinegar, a stick 
of faotse^radish> two or three bits^of lemon-peel, some 
whole pepper, a bay-leaf, and aMfiall quantity of salt. 
Boil your fish iaa this liquor, aiHi when enough (which

rate from tiie bones) take if Qp, and have ready the 
following smce : M^t a poond of butter, dissolve an 
anchory in it,put in a blade or two of mace, braise tlie 
body of a crab in f&e butt^^ a few shrimp^ or cray-fish,

BUTCHER'S MEAT. 

THE first consideratioa oif tha cook in ro^tsting must 
be to regulate the strength of her fire in {proportion to 
^the article shi^ has to dresa. If it is ai GrnaH or thin 
joint, the fire must be brisk, that it may be detoe quick ; 
but if a large one, a substantial fire n1ij3t.be.made, in 
order that it may. gradually rj^ceiv/e the. .heat, .and by 
^stirring oip the fire,, whqn^t l^gim to,b!^ni tip,, and 
licepin^ the bottom .cle^, the ix^^tf m^;be- ni^^sted 
as it ought tobe, j^d wifti^mtle ti;<^«J)te^tOtthe.ooek.

flour. If a breast, put the caul over it, with the sweet- 
bread skevi^ered on the back, and, when suflSciehtly 
done, take off the caul and dredge it with flour. Pork 
as well as Veal should be well done, otherwise it will 
nauseate : but mutton and beef, if a little underdone, 
may be dispensed with; Wild Fowls must be roasts 
ed with a clear, brisk fire, and when they are frothy, 
and of a light brown colour, they are enough. Great

care must be taken not to orerdo them, as the \om of 

gravy will produce a want of the flavour. Tame 
fowls require more roasting, and must be often basted, 
in order to keep up a stroog froth, which will make 
them look well when brought to table. Pigs and 
Geese must be done with a quick fire, turned quick, 
and frequently basted. Hares and Rabbits require 
time and care, otherwise . the body will be done too 
much, and the ends too little. Jn roasting any article, 
always allow longer time for it in frosty than in mild 
weather, and take particular care tbat your spits are 
thoroughly clean beiore you put on your meat, as nor- 
thing is more disagreeable than the mark of it left in 
the flesh. 

Having laid before the cook these necessary and gen- 
neral observations in roasting, w^e shall now proceed to 
give directions for dressing the respective articles un- 
der this head ; begiimihg with 

Beef. 

. The first steps to be taken in roasting Beef we have 
already noticed in the foreigpiog. observations. ' It re- 
mains, therefore, only to say, thait the time each joint 
wDl take doing must be propwtioned to its weight. If 
a piece of ten pounds, it will take an hour and a half at 
a good fire. Twenty pounds weight, if a thick piece, 
will take three hours, but if thin, half an horn* less ; and 
so on in proportion to th^ weight. When done, tafe it 
up, ,and put it iqtp yourdish. Serve it with potatoes^ 
horse-ra4ish, ;^nd pickles for sauce, and garnish the rini 
of the dish with horsee-radish scraped very fine. 

Mutton and Lamb. 

Mutton and Lamb must be roasted with a quick 
clear fire. Baste it as soon as you lay it down, sprinkle 
on a little salt, and wt^en near done^ dredge it with 
flour. A leg of mutton of six pounds will take an honr> 
and a quarter, and one of twelve two hours ; a breast 
half an hour at a quick fire : a. neck; an hour, and a duonln 
der much about the sa^e tiqie as a leg. In dress^ 



M EOASTtKO 

ing <9ie Mtt^ tke ehine (which is tiie two loins) and titie 
saddle (which is the two necks and part of the shoulders 
«at together) you must raise the skin, and skewer it on, 
and when near done, take off the skin, and baste it to 
froth it ttp. Send some good plain gravy up with it. 

Haua^ch jof Mutton dressed like Venison. 

Take a hind-quarter of fine mutton, stale killed, and 
cut the leg like a haunch. Lay it in a pan with the back 
downwards, pour in a bottle of red wine, and let^ the 
meat soak in it twenty-four hours* Before you spit it, 
let it be covered with clean paper and paste as you do 
venison, in order to preserve the fat. Roast it before ^ 
quick fire, and keep basting with butter mUed with 
some of the liquor in which it was soaked. When done^ 
serve it up with some good rich gruvy in one boat, and 
sweet sauce in another. It will take about three hbur^ 
roasting. 

wJ Fore-quarter of House Lamb. 

A small lore-quarter of house-lamb will take an hour 
and a half roasting ; a leg three quarters of an hour. 
When it is done, and put into the dish, cut off tKe 
shoulder, and pepper and salt the ribs. Serve it up 
with salad, broccoli, potatoes, or mint sauce. 

Tongues or Udders, 

Paeipoil the iongOB before you put it dovm to 
ro^ ; stick eight or ten cloves about it, baste it wil3i 
butter^ and serve it up with some gravy and sweet- 
meat sauce. An udd» may be roasted soler the same 
manner. You m^y also lard the tongue nicely, but 
take care that the fire does not buri) the lardiuj^. 

If your &re is good, veal Will take about a quarter of 
an hour to each pound in roaisting. The fat of the Ipin 
and fillet must be covered with paper, as we have be- 
fore d[>sarved. The fillet and Moulder mu^t be stuffed 
«fith tiie following sii^oury composition : a quarter of a 



"(Kiifhd of raet chapped Itae, panAey and sweet herlii 
'Chopped, grated bread, and lemon peel ; pepper, salt» 
and a tittle ntttmeg; and the yolk of an egg. Work 
these all vh3ll together, and stnflf them into your veal 
as secure £ls yoti can, that it may not fall out while 
roasting. The breast must be roasted with the caul 
oh tin tt is near enough ; ttien take it off, and flour and 
ba$*e the meat. When you have taken it np, and put 
itiriU} jovtt dish, pour a little melted batter over it, and 
serve it up with atiy of the feUowing sauces ; potatoes, 
In-oGoli, cactimbi^^s Stowed, French beans, peas^ caaM- 
flowers, celery stewed. Remember in dressing any 
joint of veal that it is well done, but at the same time 
let it not be too Much, if it is not done enough it will 
be too dfegiistfiil to enjoy, and if too much, the jaicm 
will be lost, and the flesh eat*tasteles^. 

Park. [ 

Pork, like veal, nwst be well done. If it is a loin, . 
take a sharp peiiknife, and cut the skin across, which 
will not only make the joint more convenient to carve, 
but will also mak^ thfe rind or crackling more pleasant 
to eat. A leg Of potfc rtiost be ^ored in the same man- 
ner as the loin ; if ndt particularly objected to, stufi* 
the knuckle part ^ith sage* and onion chopped fine, 
with pepper and salt; 'or cut a hole under the twist, 
put the seasoning there, and fasten it with a skewer. 
Koast it crisp, as it will make the cracklirig, of whicli 
'most people ate fond, eat the better. If you want u 
^Spring, (^hicW is not very coromon„ though, at the 
same time, if young, will eat CKceedlng well,) cut off 
•the shank, or knuckle, j^rinkte sage and ottion over it, 
roll it round, 'and ti^- it with d string. About two 
hours will do it ^T^i^^Spare-^rib sboulcl be bafejted 
with a little bit Of butter^ a very Kfttie dust'of ilotir, and 
'Some dried sage shrdd S'mkll; The priticipal sauced fdr 
'any kind kyf roast pbrk are; potatoes,' mtistai*d>' and 
apple sauce/ the* latter of which you must make thus: 
'Pare^ core, arid'slice soitie applfes,*and ptit them irtto'a 
saiVe-pan With a little water*, to prevent their burn-

add a piece of bdtter irnd a littte mg9st. Wh^ ya«i 
have worked the Tiiiole togetii^ very fine, set it on the 
fine till it is qiute hot, tben^KOt ijt into ypxiv hmtm, aii4 
senre it np with themeat. If it is ft 1^ of pork, hff9^ 
a little drawn gravy ready against it is done, and poor 
it into the dish when yoU serve it np. The, best waf 
of dressing Pork Oriekin is to roast it, baste it with 
a httiie batter and sage, and a Utile pepper aad ^U 
The only article used as sanc^ for this is mustard. 

. Sucking Pi^9 
Whcn yow pig is properly jn'epared fi^dresnng, 
tmt into the bc^Uy of it a Uttle sage shredded fine, with 
uome salt, a tea-spoonfol of Uack pe]^p^% and a= crast 
of brown bread. Then spit it, sew np the belly, and 
lay it down to a brisk clew fire, with a pig-plate hung 
in the middle to prevent the body part being doiie be- 
fore the ^^tremities. As soon as it is war^, pot a 
piece of bntter into a doth, and fi'eqnently rob 4hepig 
with it while roasting. When it becomes of a fine 
brown, and the steam draws to 4}ie fire, rub it quite 
dry with a clean cloth, and then with a hit of eojd but- 
ter, which will help to crisp it. |Iavii^ taken it np, 
and pat it iirto your dish, cot off ihe head with a shafp"" 
knife, and take off the cpUs^, the ears, a^d the jaw^ 
bone. Spht the jaw in two, and when you have cut

\Yhbn the goose is properly cleaned, and ready for 
dressing, put into the |x>dy a large lump of batter, then 
spit it, and lay it down to a brisk clear fire. Singe it» 
^e%eit with flour, and as soon as it begins to receive 
the heat of the fire, baste it well with butter, which 
will occasion the flesh to rise, and make it look well. 
When you think it near enough, dredge it a^n with 
flour ; .and baste it till the fi*oth rises, and it is of a clear 
light brown. When done, take it up, and put it into 
your dish, having ready the following sauce : Melt 
some butter, and put it into a spoonful of sorrel juice, a 
little sugar, and a few scalded gooseberries. Pour it 
into your sauce-boat, and send it up hot with the goose 
to table. You may like^dse add gravy and apple* 
sauce, andgarnidi your dish with a crust of bread gra- 
ted very fine. 

*A Stubble Goose 

Take two onions, with a few leaves of sage wash- 
ed clean, and chop them as, fine as possible. . Mix vyitli 
them a large piece of Gutter, spme salt, and peppe^:^, 
Put this into the body of .the goose, then tie both ends, 
and put it down to the fire to roast. Singe and dredge it 
with flour, and wHenit is thoroughly hot, baste it w}th 
fresh butter. >jVhen Tie£^:*{ipiie. dredge it ao;ain^ 
and keep basting it till the fi'oth rises, and the steam 
•draws to the fire, then take, it up,.andput it into your 
dish, pour a little boiling hot water over it, atid serve 
it up with good gravy-sauce in one boat, apple-sauce 
in another, and mustard. 

Ducl^s. 

You must prepare them for. .the spit in the same^ 
manner you .dqr geese, by putting into tlie body s.Qme, 
sage and onion chopped fine;! with pepper and saifc, 
When you lay them down, singe, dust, and b^ste tiienj 



wkb iHitlor, aad a good firewill roast them in about 
tw^enty. midates. Before you take them up, dust them 
-witti flour, and give them another basting with butter 
to make them froth and Took brown. Your gravy 
must be made of the gizzard and pinions, with an onion, 
a tea-spoonful of lemon^pickle, a few grains of pepper, 
a large blade of maee, and a tea-spoonful of catsup. 
When they are thoroughly stewed, strain off the grav-y, 
put some into the dish with the dudes, and the remain- 
der in a bo^t or basin. Wild ducks must be done in 
the same manner. 

Pigeons. 
After you have draWn your Pigeons, and taken the 
craws clean out, wash them in several waters. When 
you have dried them, roll a good lump of butter in some 
chopped parsl(^^ and seaso^ it witlv pepper and salt. 
Put this into your pigeons, then spit, dust with flour, 
and baste them. When enough,, serve them up with 
parsley and butter for sauce, and, if in season, garnish 
youf dish with bunches of asparagus. A good me will 
roast them in twenty minutes.

Cut out the bone quite clean, then beat the flesli 
well with a rojling-pin, and lard it with a piece of 
bacon cut out of the back. ; Season your bacon with 
pepper, salt, and cloves, and lard across the meat, 
that it may cut liandsomer. . Season the meat with 
pepper, salt, and cloves ; put it into an earthen pot 
with ail tl e brokien bones, half a pound of buttex% 
some bay leaves, whole pepper, one pr two shalots, 
and some sweet herbs. Let the top of the pan be 
covered quite close, then put it into the oven, and it 
will be done in about' six hours. When enough, skim 
off the fat clean, put the meat into a dish, and serve 
it up with a good ragout of mushrooms, truffles, force-

a little pepper and salt over it, and put into the dish 
a bunch of sweet hierbs, anoiSmu; a blade of mace, 
some whole pepper, two cloves, and a pint of water, 
and boil the brains with some sage. When the head 
is enough, lay it on a 4ish> mad put it before the fire

■ ' Hadiotkk and Whitings. 

W'hen you have gutted and clean wa^d.them^ 
dry them well in a cloth, and rub a little vinegar over 
them, which will prevent the skin firom l^reakiug. 
Having done this, dredge them well with flour^. and 
before you put them on, rub the gridiron well with 
beef suet. Let your gridiron be very hot when you 
lay your fish on, othervnse they will stick to it, and 
the fish be Iwroke in tumiiig. While they are broiling, 
ttimc tiilwi two or three times, and when ^ough serve 
tll^i!^ up with plain meit^ butter, or shrimp sauce. 

ABDthar, and indeed a very excellent method of 
blXKBing tttjoie fish is thus : when you have cleaned and 
dri^d them as before-mentioned, put. them into a tin 
oven, and set them before a quick fire. As soon as 
the dcins begin to rise, take them fi^m the fire, and 
having beat up an ^^, rub it over them with a fea« 
ther. Sprinkle a few crumbs of bread over them, 
dredge them well with flour, and rub your gridiron, 
wh«Q hot, with suet or butter. Lay on your fish, 
and when you have turned them, rub over a littte 
butter^ and keep turning them till they are done,

Eels pUch-coched. 

Take a large eel, and scoor it well with salt, to 
clean off the s^e ; then slit it down the back, take

the yolk of an egg, and pat it over the inside, sprinkle 
on crambs of bread vnth some sweet harbs and pars*

and when enoij^h, serve it ap with anchovy saace, 
and parsley and batter. Ganush with raw parsley 
and horse-radish. 

Another method of pitch-codung eds is, when you 
have gutted, cleansed, and properly dried them, sfNTinr 
kle them with pepper, salt, and a little dried sage, turn 
them backward and forward, and skewer them. Rub

course. 



SECT. II. 

FRYING FISH. 

As a necessary prelude to our directions for frying 
fish, it may not be improper to make the few following 
general observations : When you fry any kind of fish, 
first dry them in a cloth, and then flour them. Put 
into your frying-pan plenty of dripping or hog S lard, 
and let it boil before you put it into a dish. When 
they are properly fried, lay them in a dish, or hair 
sieve, to drain. If you fry parsley, be sure to pick it 
very cautiously, wash it wefl, dip it into cold water, 
and throw it into a pan of boiling fat. This will make 
it very crisp, and of a fine green, provided you do not 
let it remain too long in the pan ; but this you may 
prevent by its appearance while doing. 

TurhoL 
Having properly cleansed your fish (which in this 
mode of dressing must be small) and thorocighly dried 
it, strew on some flour, and put it into your paii« with 
a suffid^rt quantity of hot lard to cover it. When It 
is fried mce and brown, take it cajrefully Qtit> ahd thor 
rQ|]|ghly drain the fajb from it In the mmnitainexteaii 
the pan, /put mto it as much dais^t and whit!^ wine as 
will naaiiy cov^ the fish, with an ancbpvy, salt, nu^ 
mfg, and : a little ginger. Put m the tilrbot, aiMi 
let it remain in tha Mqpm tall it .is ha}f w.a«(^; ibM^ 



take it oQt, and pnt ixk^fmm Qf botj^iolM in floor, 
and a minced lemon. Let them SMQiner together till 
of a proper thickness, then rub a hot dish with a 
piece of shdot, lay the tnrbot in the diiih, pour o?ef 
the sauce, and serve it up. You may Ukenriae add 
plaip melted butter in ^ \^n, 

Carp. 

After having cleansed your fish, lay them in 9 
eIo<^ to dry, then flour them, put them into the pan, 
and fry them of a light brown. Take some cruj^ts of 
bread, cut them three comer ways, and fry them v^ ith 
the roes of the fish. When your fish are nicely fried, 
lay them on a coarse doth to drain, and prepare an- 
ehovy sauce with the juice of a lemon. Lay your 
carp in the dish, with the roes ori each side, and gar- 
mA -vri^ the firied crust, and slices of lemon. 

Tench. 
Split the fish along the backs^ and raise the flesh 
from the bone : then cut the skin across at the head 
and tail, strip it clean ofi*, and t^ke out the bone. 
Having thus prepared them for frying, take one of 
them, and mirice the flesh very small, with mush- 
rooms, chives, and parsley chopped fine ; a little salt, 
Sepper, beaten mace, nutmeg, and a few savory herbs. 
lix these well together, then pound them in a mor- 
t'ur and crumbs of bread soaked in cream, the yolks 
of three or four eggs, and a piece of butter; and witl^ 
this composition stuff your fish. Put clarified butter 
into your pan, set it over the fire, and when it is 
Hot sttew some flour on your fish, and put tiiem in one? 
by one. When they have firied till they are of a nice 
Inrown colour, take them up, and laythem in a coarse 
cloth- before the fire to ke^ hot. Thea pour all the 
fat wt of the pa^, put in a <|iiarter of a poipd of but* 
ter, aiid shake in some flour. Keep it wtiag with 
a spoon till the butter is a little hrown, and then put 
in half a pint of wWte wine. Stir them together, 
^nd put in half a pint of boUiBg water, an onion 
shred with cloves, a bomdl bf >lveQt herlw, and two 



84 rvriKe 

blades of*mace. Cover thetie close, and let them stew 
as gently as you can fen* a quarter of an hour, th^n 
strain off the liquor, and put them into the pan again, 
adding two spoon^ of catsup, an ounce of truffle;? 
or morels boiled tender in halt a pint of water, a few 
mushrooms, and half a pint of oysters, washed clean 
in their own liquor. When your sauce is properly heat- ^ 
ed, and has a good flavour, put in your tench, and let 
them lay in it till they are thoroughly hot ; then take 
them out, lay them in your dish^ and pour the sauce 
over them. Garnish with sliced lemon. The «ame 
methods may be used in frying of carp. 

Soles. \ 

Take off the skin, rub the fish over with the yolk 
of an egg, and strew on some crumbs of bread. Fry 
them in hog's lard over a brisk fire, till they are of a 
fine light brown. Then take them up, drain them, 
put them into yoor dish, and serve them up with plain 
melted butter in a boat. Garnish with green pickles. 

Smelts. 
Be careful to take away the gills, but leave in the 
roes. Afler you have washed them, dry them well in 
a cloth, then beat up an ^;g very fine, rub it ov^ them 
with a feath^, and strew on crumbs of bread. Fry 
them in hogs lard over a brisk fire, and put them 
in when the fat is boiling hot. When they are 
done of a fine brown, take them out, and drain the fat 
from them, and when yoiii dish them i:q), put a basin 
with -the bottom upwards, into the middle of your 
dish, and lay the tmls of your fish on the side of it. 
Garnish wifli fried parsley. 

Eels. 
After having properly cleaned them, and taken 
off the heads, cut them into pieces, season them witii 
pepper and salt, strew on some flour, and firy them tiB 
they are of a fine brown colour. Drain them properly 
before you lay them in the dish. Serve them up with 
melted butter and the juice of a lemon squeezed hHb 
it. Garnish with crisped parsley. . ^ . 



86 

, When jon cat them open to clean them^ be care- 
fal to save the blood, and wash them thoroughly clean 
in warm water. Fry them in clean dripping, and 
when neariy enough, put oat the fat, pat a little White 
wine, and give the pan a shake round. Throw a lit* 
tie pepper, with -some sweet tieribr, ftfew capers, a 
piece of batter rolled in floor, and the blood you saved 
from the fish. Cover the pan close, and shake it 
often. When they are enough, take them out, strain 
the-sadce, ptit it into the pan again, and give it a quick 
boil. Squeease in the juice of a lemon, stir all together, 
and when it is just upon the boil, pour it over the fish, 
and serve it i^. Garnish with sliced lemon. 

, MtUlets. 
Spo&JB the fish across- tiie back, and dip them in 
melted butter. Fry them in batter darified, and when' 
enough, lay them on a warm dfth. Serve them up^ 
with plain mdted butter or anchovy sauce. 

Herrings. 
First scrape off all the scales, then wasli them 
dry them well in a ek>th» and dredge them with flour. 
Fry them in butt^ over a brisk fire, and when done, 
set their tails up one against another in the middle of 
the dish. Fry a large hanidfiil of parsley crisp, take 
it out before it loses its colour ; lay it round the fish, 
and serve them up with melted butter, parsley, and 
mustard. 

Oysters. 

The largest oysters you can get should be chosen 
for Crying. When you have properly deaned and rin- 
sed them, strew over tiiem a little grated nutmeg, a 
Made of mace pounded, a ^x)oidu1 of flour, and a lit'* 
tie salt. Dip yocer casters imigly into this, and fry. 
them in hog's lard till they are of a nice brown co- 
bitaf. Thm take them out of tike pan, pour them into ' 
jmf dish, and pMr ov» tton a little melted butter, 
with crumbs of bread nuxed.

Take a fine white-heart cabbage, wash it clean, 
and boil it about five minutes. Then drain it, cut the 
stalk flat to. stand in a dish, carefully open the leaves, 
and take out the inside, leaving the outside leaves 
whole. Cut what you take out very fine : then take 
the flesh of two or three flounders or plaice, and diop 
it with the cabbage, the volks and whites of four eggs 
boiled hard, and a handiul of picked parsley. ' Beat 
all together in a mortar with a quarter of a pound of 
melted butter. Then mix it up with the yolk of an

it, an onion, a Uttle allspice, a little pepper, and 
some salt. Cover it close, and when it toils take off

eels are enough^ lay your pig in the dish^ and your 
pettitoes round it ; but do not put in the head, as that 
will make a pretty cold dish. Then lay your eels and 
eraw-fisfa over them, and take the liquor they were 
stewed in, skim off the fat, and add to it halt a pint 
of strong gravy, thickened with a little piece of burnt 
,]^utter. Pour this over it, and garnish with lemon and

Shake aJl together, then put in your pheasant, with a 
few mushrooms, and let them stew about five or six 
minutes more. Then take up your pheasant, pour the 
ragpo over it, and lay fi)rcemeat-bal£s round. Gai^nish 
with lemon. 

SnipeSy or Woodcocks^ in surtout. 

Take some forcemeat made of veal, as much beef- 
suet chopped and beat in a mortar, with an equal 
quantity of crumbs of bread; mix in a little beaten 
mace, pepper and salt, some parsley, a few sweet 
herbs, and the ydk of an egg. Lay some of this meat 
round the dish^ andth^ put in the snipes, being finst 
drawn and half roasted. Take care ot the trail, chop 
it, and scatter it all over the dish. Take some good 
gravy, according to the bigness of your surtout, some 
truffles and morels, a few mushrooms, a sW.eetbread 
cut into pieces, and artichoke-bottoms cut small. Let 
all stew together, shake them, and take the yolks of 
two or three ^gs, beat them up with a spoonfid or 
two of white wine, aiid stir all togeOket one way. 
When it is thick, take it off, let it cool, and pour it 
into the surtout. Put in the yolks of a few hard eggs 
here aod there, season with beaten mace, pepper, and 
salt, to your taste; cover with the forcemeat all over, 
then rub on the yolks of eggs to colour it, and send it 
to the oven. Half an hour will do it sufficiently.

before a clear brisk fire ; baste them with butter, and 
strew over them some crumbs of bread mixed with 
flour. Fry some crumbs of bread of a fine brown in 
butter. Lay the larks round the dish, and the bread- 
crumbs in the middle. 

Florendine Hares. 

.Let your hare be a full-grbvm one, and let it hang 
up four or five days befi>re you case it. Leave on the 
ears, but take out all the bones except those of the 
head, which must be left entire. Lay your hare on 
the table, and put into it the following forcemeat : take 
the crumb of a two-penny loaf, the liver shred fine, 
half a pound of fat bacon scraped, a glass of red wine, 
an anchovy, two eggs, a Httle vnnter savory, some 
sw^t-marjorum, thyme, and i, little pepper, salt, and 
nutmeg. Havii^ put this into the bdly, roll it up to 
the head, and &sten it with packthread, as you would 
a collar of veal. Wrap it in a doth, and boil it an 
hour and a half in a saucepan, covered with tw6 quarts 
of water. As soon as the liquor is reduced to abottt 
a quart, put -in a pint olf red wihe, a spoonful of temoii* 
pickle, one of catsup, and the same of brovming. Then

Florendine Rabbits. 

Skin three young rabbits, but leave on the ears, 
and wash and dry them with a cloth. Take out the 
bones as carefully as you can, but leave the head 
whole, and proceed in the same manner as before di^ 
rected for the hare. Have ready a white sauce made 
of veal gravy, a Uttle anchovy, and the juice of half a 
lemon, or a tea-spoonful of lemon-pickle. Strain it, 
and then put in a quarter of a pound of butter rolled in 
flour, so as to make the sauce pretty thick. Beat up 
the yolk of an egg, put to it some thick cream, nutmeg, 
and salt, and mix it with the gravy. Let it simmer a 
little over the fire, but not bott, then pour it over your 
rabbits, and serve them up. Garnish with lemon and 
barberries. 

Jugged Hare. 

Cut your hare into small pieces, and lard them 
here and there with little slips of bacon, season them 
with pepper and salt, and put them in an earthen jug, 
with a blade or two of mace, an onion stuck with cloves, 
and a bunch of sweet herbs. Cover the jug close,, 
that nothing may get in ; set it in a pot of boiling wa- 
ter, and three hours will doit. Then turn it into the 
dish, take out the onion and sweet herbs, and send it 
hot to table.

CHAPTER XIII. 

, * rEjGETABLES and ^OOTS^ 

Itf dressing these articles, the greatest attention mu;«t 
be paid to deanlmess. They are, partietdarly at some 



▼MNBVdMMMN I6T 

Hmm of the year, sutject to dxut, dirt» sod iiiMct8> m 
tiiat if they are not property eleamed, they will be 
HDsati^actory to those for whom they are provided^ 
and disreputable to the co€k. To avoid this; be caie- 
fid firstto pick off all tbie outside leaves, then wash them 
well in several waters, and let them lie some time in a 
p«i of clean water before you dress them. Be sore 
your saucepan is thoroughly clean, and boil than by 
themselves in plenty of water. They should always 
be brought crisp to taUe, which will be effected by be- 
ii^ careful not to boil them too much. Such are the 
general observations necessary to be attended to in 
dressing of Vegetables and Roots. We shall now 
proceed to particulars, hymning with 

Scrape all the stalks very oalrefiilly tiU they look 
whke, then cut them all even alike, and throw 'them 
into a pan of clean water, and have ready a stew-pan 
with water boiling. Put some salt in, and when they 
are a little tender t^ke them up. If you boil them too 
much, they will h)se both their colour and taste. Cut 
the round off a small loaf, about half an inch thick, and 
toast it brown on both rides : then dip it into the 
fiquor the asparagus was boiled in, and lay it in your 
dish. Pour a little melted butter over your toast, then . 
lay your asparagus on the toast all round your dish, 
• with the heads inwards, and send it to table, wilii 
melted butter in a barin. Some pour melted butter 
over them, but this is injudicious, as it makes the hand- 
ling them Very, disagreeable. 

Artichokes. 
Twist off the stalks, then put them into cold 
water, and wash them well. When the water boils, 
put them in with the tops downwards, that all the dust 
and sand may boil out About an hour and a half, 
or two hours, will dq them. Serve them up with 
melted butter in cups; 

Broccoli^ 
CAumwiTLhr strip off aH the tittle branches tiU yon 



ciome to the top on^, and then witH a knife peel off 
the hard ontside skin that is on the stalks and little 
branches, and throw them into water. Have ready a 
stew-pan of water, throw in a little salt, and when it 
boils, pot in your broccoli. When the stalks are 
tender, it is enough. Put in a piece of toasted bread, 
soaked in the water the brocicoli was boiled in at the 
bottom of your dish, aiid put your broccoli on the top 
of it, as you do asparagus. Send them up to table 
laid in bunches, with butter in a boat. 

Cauliflowers. 

Take off the green part, then cut the flower into 
four parts, and lay them in water for an hour. Then 
have some miljk and water boiling, put in the cauli- 
flowers, and be sure to skim the saucepan well. When 
the stalks feel tender, take up the flowers cai^fully» 
and put them in a cullender to drain. Then put a 
spoonful of water into a clean stew-pan, with a little 
dust of flour, about a quarter of a pound of butter, a 
little pepper and salt, and shake it round till the hutr 
ter is melted, and the whole well mixed together. 
Then take half the cauliflower, and cut it as you would 
fur pickling. Lay it into the stew-pan, turn it, and 
. shake the pan round for about ten minutes, which will 
be sufficient time to do it properly. Lay the stewed 
in the middle of your plate, the boiled round it, and 
pour over it the butter in which the one-half was 
stewed. This is a delicate mode of dressing cauli- 
flowers; but the usual way is as. follows: cut the 
stalks off, leave a little green on, and boil them in 
spring water an<d salt for about fifteen minutes. Then 
take them out, (kain them, and send them whole to 
table, with melted butter in a sauce-boat. 

Chreen Peas. 

Let your peas be shelled as short a time as you can 
before they ?xe dressed, as otherwise they will lose a 
great part of their sweetness. Put them into boiling 
water, with a little salt and a lumpt>f loftf sngsHr, afi^ 



VS««TABLfi8. 169 

vfkeulhef heffn to de»t in the middle, they are enough. 
Pat them into a sieve, drain the water cleai* from them, 
and pour them into your dish. Put in them a good 
lamp oi buttar, and stir tii^pi about with a spoon till 
it is th(»roughly melted. Mix with them likewise a 
little pi^pper and salt. Boil a small bunch of mint by 
itself, chop it fine, and lay it in lumps rowtd the edge 
of your dish. Melted butter is sometimes preferred 
to mixing it with the peas. 

Windsor Beans. 

T^ESE must be boiled in plenty of water, with a 
good quantity of salt in it, and when they feel tender, 
are enough. Boil and chop some parsley, put it into 
good melted butter, and serve them up with boiled 
bacon, and the batter and parsley, in a boat. Remem- 
ber never to boil theioi with bacon, as that will greatly 
discolour them. 

Eidney Beans. 

First carefully string them, then slit them down 
the middle, and cut them across. Put them into salt 
and water, and when the water boils in your sauce- 
pan, put them in with a little salt. They will be soon 
done, which may be known by their feeling tender. 
Drain the water clear from them, lay tiiem in. a plate, 
and send them up with butter in a sauce-boat. 

Spinach. 

Be careful to pick it exceeding clean, then wash it 
in five or six waters, put it into a saucepan that will 
just -hold it, without water, throw a little suit over it, 
and cover it (jlose. Put your saucepan on a clear 
quick fire, and when you find the spinach shrunk and 
fellen to the bottom, and the liquor that tomes out 
boils up, it is done. Then put it into a clean sieve to 
drain, and just give it a gentle squeeze. Lay it on 
a plate, and send it to table, with melted butter in a 
bcmt. 

Cabbages. 

After you have taken off thfe outer leaves, ana 
vf^ wnApA $^em, qUvxrter them, ^and boil them 19

they are enough, take them out, put them into a pan, 
mash them with batter, and a little salt, and in that 
state se^d tbpmi to taUe. 

Anotbetr method of boUing turnip^ is tb#» : When 
you have pared th^m^ c^ them into little square 
pieces, then put them into a saucepan, and just cover 
them with water. As soon as they aare enough, tnke 
them off the fire, and put them into a sieve to drain. 
Then put them into a saucepan, with a good piece of 
butter, stir them over the fire a few muiutes, put them 
into your dish, and serve them up. 

Carrots. ' 
Sgrap£ yomv carrots very clean, put them into the 
pot, and when they are enough, t^Jce them out and 
rub them in a clean doth. Then slice them? into a 
plate, and pour some melted butter over them. If 
they are young, half an hour witt sufficiently boil them. 

Parmips. 
. Thbsc must be boiled in plenty of water, s^nd when 
ihey are soft, which you may know by runmngf a fork 
ittto them, take them up. Scrape them all fine With 
a knife, tteow away aD the sticky part, and send theni 
(o table, with melted butter in a sauce-boat. 

Potatoes. 
These must be boiled in so small a qvm^tiby dT 
water as will be just sufficient to keep the saucepan 
ftom burning. Keep them close»covered, and as soon 
as the skins begin to crack, they are enough. Having 
drained out aU the water^ let them remain in the sauce-

PUDDINGS. 

IN tiiia degi^ee ef eookery «ome previous and gene- 
ral oteeivatiom are necessary, the most material oi 
wiikh.«re, first, that your cloth be thoroughly clean, 
aad bdbre yo«i pilt yotir pudding into it, dip it into 
lioiitog water, strew some flour over it, and then give 
it a shake. If it is a bread pudding, tie it loose ; but 
if a batter podding, close; and never put your pudding 
In till tt^e water bwls. All bread and custard puddings 
Itiat'are l^ked require time and a moderate oven; but 
batter and rice puddings a quick oven. Before you 
put yi9W pudding into the dish for baking be carefiil 
always to moisten the bottom and sides wilh butter.

put it into your cloth, tie it loose to give it rootm to 
Bwell, and boil it an hour. When done, put it into 
your dish, pour melted butter over, and serve it to 
table. ' ^ - 

Another,* but more expensive, way of making a 
faread-pudding is this: cut thin all the crumb of a 
stale penny Ibaf, and put it into a qudrt of Cream, set 
it over a slow fire, till it is scalding hot, and then let it 
stand till it is cold. Beat up the bread and the cream 
well together, and grate in some nutmeg. Take twelve 
bitter almonds, boil them.in two spoonsful of water, 
pour the water to the cream, stir it in with a little salt, 
and sweeten it to your taste. Blanch the almonds in 
.a mortar, withjtwo spoonsfiilof rose o;:;orange-flower

well, before you put in the pudding; tie it loose, and 
let it boil an hour. Take care the water, boils when 
• you put it in, and that it keeps so all the time.. When 
it is enough, turn it into your dish. Melt soma but- 
ter, and put in it two or three spoonsful of white -wine 
or sack; give it a boil, and pour it over your pudding. 
Then strew a good deal of fine sugar over your pud- 
ding and dish, and send it hot to table. Instead of a 
cloth, you may boil it in a bowl or basin, which is in- 
deed the better way of the two. In this case, wh^i 
it is enough, take it up in the bi^n, and let it stand 
aminpte or two to cool; then untie the ^tfi^j^j^dfta:^

Batter Pudding. 

; Takb a quartofiniik) beat up the yolks of six eggs, 
and the whites of three, and mix' them with a quarter 
of a pint o( milk. Then take six spoonsful of floor, a 
tea-spoonful of salt, and one of ginger. Put to these 
the remainder of the milk, mix all well together, pot 
it into your cloth, and boil it an hour and a quarter. 
Pour melted butter over it when you serve it up. 

A batter pudding may be made without eggs, in 
which case proceed thus : take a quart of milk, mix 
six ^x)onsful of flour with a little of the milk first, a 
tea-spoonful of salt, two of beaten ginger, and two of 
tiie tincture of saflron. Then mix all together, and 
boil it an hoiir. 

Custard Pudding. 

Put a piece of cinnamon intp.a pint of thick cream, 
boil it, and add a quarter of a pound of sugar. When 
cold, put in the yolks of five eggs well beaten : stir 
this over the fire till it is pretty thick, but be careful 
it does not boil. When quite cold, batter a cloth well, 
dust it with flour, tie the custard in it very close, and 
boil it three quarters of an hour. When you take it 
up put it into a basin to cool a little ; untie the cloth, 
lay the dish on the basin, and turn it carefiiUy out. 
Grate over it a little sngar, and serve it up with melted 
butter and a little wine in a boat.

CHAPTER XV^ 

PlJtS. 

THERE are several ttkings necessary to be parti- 
colarly observed by the cook; in order that her labours 
and ingenuity under this head may be bmught to their 
pr(^r degree of perfection. One very material consi- 
deration must be, that ike heat of the oven is duly 
proportioned to the nature of the article to be baked. 
Light paste requires a moderate oven ; if it is too quick, 
the crust cannot rise, and will therefwe be bqmed ; and 
if too dow, it will be soddened, and want that deli- 
cate light brown it ought to have. Raised pies must 
have aquiek oven, aind be Well closed up, or tiiey will 
sink in tiieir sides, aMl lose their pixipdr riiape. Tarts 
that are iced, should be baked in a slow oven, or the 
icing will become brown ijcfore the paste is properly 
baked. 

Having made these j^eneral observations respecting 
the baking of pies, we shall now direct the cook how 
to make the different kinds of paste, as they must be 
proportioned in the qualities according to the respec- 
tiye articles for which they are to be used. 

Puff Paste miist be made thus : Take a quarter of 
a '^6ck of flour, andn-ub it into a pound of butter very 
fttt6. jfeke it up into a light paste, with cold water, 
ftrst stiff eniough to work it up. Then roll it out about 
as thick as a; j^rown piece ; put a layer of butter all 
over, then sprinkle on a little flour, double it up, and 
roll it out agaiii. Double and roll it, with layers of 
bnttsr three times, and it wiH be ^nroperly fit for use. 

Shcirt Ormt. Put sb: ocmces of butCst t<^ eight of 
flour> and work tbem weU tog^lier; th^ ttik it xm 
with as littlia water as possible, so as to have it a stit- 
fish paste; then roll it out thin for use. 



190 M£AT PIES. 

Ji goad Paste fw large Pies. Take a^peck of four, 
and pot to it three eggs; then put in half a pound of 
suet, and a pound and a half of butter and suet, and 
as much of the liquor as will make it a good light crust. 
Work it up well, and roll it out. 

•/f standing Crust for great Pies. Take a peck 
of flour and six pounds of butter boiled in a gallon of 
water : skim it off into the flour, and as little of the 
liquor as you can. Work it up well into a paste, and 
then puli ic into pieces till it is cold. Then make it 
up into what form you please. 

Paste" for Tarts. Put an ounce of loaf sugar beat 
and sifted to one pound of fine flour. Make it into a 
«tiff paste, with a gill of boiling cream, and three 
ounces of butter. Work it well, and roll it very thin. 

Paste for Custards. To half a pound of flour put 
six ounces of butter, the yolks of two eggs, and three 
spoonsful of cream. Mix them together, and let 
them stand a quarter of an hour; tteu Wdtk it up 
and down, and roll it out very thin.

make a good puff-paste, and lay it near half an inch 
thick round the edge of the dish ; roll out the lid, 
which must be a little thicker than the paste on the 
edge of the dish, and lay it on ; then roll out another 
lid pretty thin, and cut in flowers, leaves, or whatever 
form you please, and lay it on the lid. If you do not 
want it, it will keep in the pot that it was baked in 
eight or ten days; but let the crust be kept on, that the 
air may not get to it. A breast and shoulder of veni- 
aon is the mo^t proper for pasty.

erast. Put name fine wgar at tiie bottom, tiiea lay 
iu your fruit, strew more sog/BiX at top,^ covw tfaran^ 
and bake them in a slack oven. Corrants and rasp* 
berries make an exceeding good tart, and require 
little baking 

Apples and pears intended for tarts must be ma* 
naged thus : cut them intaquarters^ and take out tbe 
cores, then jcut the quarters across^ and put them into 
a saucepan, with as much water as wiU barely eover 
them, and let them simmer on a slow fire till the fruit 
is tender^ Pqt a good piece o( lemon-peel into tihe 
water with the fruit, and then have your patties ready: 
Lay fine sugar at bottom, th^i y<Hir firuity and a little 
sugar at top. Pour over each tart one tea-spoonful 
of lemon-juice, and three of the liquor they were boil- 
ed in ; then put on your fid, and bake them in a slack 
oven. Apricot tarts may be made in the same man- 
ner, only that you must not put in any lemcm-juice. 

Preserved fruit requires very little baking, and that 
which is very hifi^ preserved should not be baked at 
all. In this case, l^e crust should be first baked upon 
a tin the size of the intended tart; cut it with a mark- 
itig iron, and wh«tt cold, take it off, and lay k on &^ 
fruit. <

, ONE very material matter to be attended to in 
making these articles is, that all your ingredients are 
ready at the time you are going to make them, and 
that you do not leave them till your business is d(Mie> 
but be parti^jBlarly observant with respect to the 
eggs when beaten up, which, if left at any time, must 
be again beaten, and by that mieans your cake will not 
be so ligh^a^ it otherwise would and ought to be. If 
you use butter to your cakes, be carreful, in beating it 
to a fine cream before you mix the.si^ar ;Wi(h it<

CHAPTER XX, 
THE ART OF COJH'FECTIONARr. 

SECT. !• 

THE METHOD OF PREPARING SUGARS AND 
COLOURS. 

THE first process in the art of confectionary is that 
d clarifying sugarSf which requires great care and 
attention, and must be done according to the following 

direction : 

Break the white of aQ egg into your preserving-pan, 
put to it four quarts of water, and beat it up to a froth 
with a whisk. Then put in twelve pounds of sugar, 
mix all together, and set it over the fire. When it 
boils put in a little cold water, and* in this manner 
proceed as many times -as maybe necessary, till the 
scum appears thick on the top. Then remove it fi*om 
the fire, and when it is settled take off the scum, and 
pass it through a straining-bag. If the sugar should 
not appear very fine, give it another boil before you 
strain it.— This is the first operation, having done 
which you may proceed to clarify your sugar to either 
of the following degrees : 

1. Smoother Candy Sugar. — After having gone 
through the first process, as before dh-ected, put what 
quantity you may have occasion for over the fire, and 
let it boil till it is smooth. This you may know by 
dipping your skimmer into the sugar, and then touch- 
ing it between your fore-finger and thumb, and im- 
mediately on opening them, you will observe a small 
thread drawn between, which will immediately break, 
and remain on a drop on your thumb, which will be a 
sign of its being in some degree of smoothness. Then 
give it another boiling, and it will draw into a larger 
string, when it will have acquired the first degree, 
from whence we proceed to. 

No. 10. 2 p 



234 CONFECnONARY. 

2. Bloom Sugar. — In this degree of refining sugar, 
yon must boil it longer than in tb& former process, and 
then dip your skimmer in, shaking off what sugar you 
can into tiiB pan then bk>w with yotn: motitli s6x)ngly 
through the holes, and if certain bladders, or bubbles, 
go through, it will be a proof that it has acquired the 
second degree. 

3. Feathered Sugar. — To prove this degree, dip 
the skimmer into the sugar when it has boiled longer 
than in the former degrees. When you have so done, 
first shake it ovar the pan, then give it a sudden flirt 
behind you, and if it is enough, the sugar will fly off 
like feathers. 

4. Crackled Sugar. — Boil your sugar longer than 
in the preceding degree ; then dip a stick into it, and 
immediately put it into a pan of cold water, which you 
must have by you for that purpose. Draw off the 
sugar that hangs to the stick into the water, and if it 
becomes hard; and snaps, it Kas acquired thB proper 
degree; but if otherwise, you niust boil it again till it 
answers that trial. Be particularly careful that the 
water you use for this purpose is perfectly cold, othei*- 
wise you will be greatly deceived. 

5. Carmel Sugars.^^To obtain the last degree, 
your sugar must boil longer than in eitfa^ of (he former 
operation9. You must prove it by dipping a stick, first 
into the sugar, and then into cold water; but thia you 
must observe, that when it comes to the carmel height, 
it will, the moment it touches the water, snap like 
glass, which is the highest and last degree of refining' 
sugar. When you boil this, take care that your fire is 
not too fierce, lest it should, by flaming up the sides of 
the pan, cause the sugar to bum, discolour it, and 
thereby destroy all your labour. 

Having thus described the various degrees of refin- 
ing sugar, we shall now point out the method of pre- 
paring those colours "with which they may be tinged, 
according to the fency, and the different purposes for » 
which they are to be used. 



fied Colour. 
. To qiake this colour, boil au ounce of cochineal in 
half a pint of water^ for above five minutes; then add 
half an ounce of cream of tartar, and half an ounce of 
pounded alum, and boil the whole on a slow fire about 
as long again. In order to know if it is done, dip a 
pen into it, write on white paper, and if it shows the 
colour clear, it is sufficient Then take it off the fire, 
ad4 (wo ounces of sugar, and let it settle. Pour it 
clear off^^and keep it in a bottle well stopped for use. 

Blue Colour. 
This colour is only for present use, and must be 
made thus : put a little warm water into a plate, and 
rub an indigo stone in it till the colour is come to the 
tint' you would have it. The more you rub it, the 
higher the colour will be. 

Yellow Colour. 
This is done by pouring a little water into a plate, 
and rubbing it with a bit of gamboge. It may also 
be done with yellow lily thus : take the heart of the 
flower, infuse the colour with milk- warm water, and 
preserve it in 4 bottle well stopped. 

Green Colour. 

Trim the leaves of some spinach, boil them about 
half a minute in a little water, then strain it clear off, 
and it will be fit for use. 

Any alteration may be made in these colours, by 
mixing to what shade you think proper ; but on these 
occasions taste and fancy must be your guide. 

Devices in Sugar. 
Steep gum-tragacanth in rose-water, and with some 
double-refined sugar make it into a paste. Colour it 
to your, fancy, and make up your device in stich fiirms 
as you may think proper. You may have moulds 
made in. various shapes for this purpose, and your de- 
vices will be pretty ornandents placcni on the top of iced 
cakes. 20*

then squee55eout the juice of four oranges. Put them 
into a stew-span, with a pint of water, and eight ounces 
of sugar ; mix with them the whites of five eggs well 
beat, and set the whole over the fire. Stir it One way 
till it becomes thick and white, then strain rt through 
a gauze, and keep stirring it till it is cold. Then beat 
the yolks of five eggs very fine, and put it into your 
pan with some cream and the other articles. Stir it 
over a slow fire till it is ready to boil, and pour it into 
a basin, and having stinted it till it is quite cold, put it 
into your glasses. 

Lemon Cream. 

Cut off the rinds of two lenions as thin as you can, 
then squeeze out the juice of three, and add to them a 
pi&tef sprifig^ waters. Mix with Uvmi the WMl6s of

pmt iof cream, and four ounces of fine sugar, and let it 
just boil npw Pot it into jeUy-glasses, let it stand till 
it is cold, and then, by dipping your glasses into scald- 
ing wateri it will slip out whole. Then stick them all 
over with siloes of almonds cut lengthways. It is gene- 
rally eaten with white wine and Bt^ar. 

Burnt Creum. 
Take a little clariified sugar, put it into your sugar- 
pan, an^ let it boil till it colours in the pan ; then pour 
in your cream, stirring it all the time till the sugar is 
dissolved. The cream may be made in the following 
manner : to a pint of cream take five ^gs, a quarter 
of a pound of fine sugar, and a spoonful of orange-flower 
water ; set it over the fire, stirring it till it is thick ; 
but be sure it does not boil, or else it will curdle. 

Burnt Cream another Way. 
Boil a pmt of cream with sugar and a little lemon- 
peel shred fine ; and then beat up the yolks of six, and 
the whites of four eggs separately. When your cream 
has got cool, put in your eggs, with a spoonful of orange- 
flower water, and one of fine flom*. Set it over the fire, 
keep stirring it till it is thick, and then pour it into a 
dish. When it is cold, sift a quarter of a pound of fine 
sugar all over it, and hold a hot salamander over it till 
it is of a nice light brown colour. 

Blanched Cream.

some fii% sugar and orange-flower water. Boil it, and 
beat up the ^tiites of twenty eggs, t<rith a little cold 
cream; stritin it> and wh^ the cream is Upon the boil, 
pour in the eggis, and keep stirring it till it comes to a 
thick curd. Then take it up, and strain it throtigh a 
nair sieve ; beat it wefl with a spoon till it is cold^ and 
then ipA it into a dish.

Put two spoonsful of flour iuto ^ stew-^pan, with 
some grated lemou-peel| some dried omnge-flowen 
shred fine, and a little salt; beat up the yoSkB and 
whites of six eggs, with a pint of milk,, anid a bit of 
sugar; make it boil, and stir it over the fine half an ^ 
hour : when cold, use it to make a franchipane pie or 
tartlets, for which nothing more is necessary than to 
put it upon a puff-paste, and when it is cold glaze it 
with sugar. You may put in a few ratifia biscuits to 
give it a flavour. 

Whipt Cream. 
Ta^e the whites of eight eggs, a quart of thick 
cream, and half a pint of sack. Mix them together, 
and sweeten it to your taste with double-refined sugar* " 
You may perfume it, if you please, with a little musk 
or ambergris tied in a rag, and steeped a little in the ^ 
cream. Whip it up with a whisk, and some lemon-peel 
tied in the middle of the whisk. Take thie firoth with 
a spoon, and lay it in your glasses or basins. This put 
over fine tarts has a pretty appearance. 

Spanish Cream. 

Take thre6 spoonsful of flour of rice sifted very fine, 
the yolks of three eggs, three spoonsful of water, and 
two of orange-flower water. Then put to them one 
pint of cream, and set it upon a good fire ; keep stirring

isinglass, and put them into a stone bottle; fiU it up 
with fair water to the neck ; put in a $mall quantity 
of gum-arabic and gum-dragon ; then tie up tl^ bottle r 
very close, and set it into a pot of water, with hay at 
the bottom. When it has stood six hours, take it out, 
and let it stand an hour before you open it ;. tbi^n strain 
it, and it will be a strong jfslly. Take a pound of 
blanched almonds, beat them very fine, mix it with a : 
pint of thick cream, and let it staled a little ; then rtmiA :

When it is cold, turn them, and lay bold cream about 
them in heaps. Be careful it does not boil when you 
pat in the cream. 

Barley Cream. 
Take a small quantity of pearl barley, boil it in 
milk and water till it is tender, and then strain <^ the

the size • of your dish : beat up the yolks of six eggs 
with a little flour, and then add some cream; strain it 
through a sieve into your stew-pan, and thicken it over 
the fire. Serve it up, afler passing a hot salamander, 
not too hot, over it. 

Chocolate Cream. 

Take a quarter of a pound of the best chocolate, 
and haying scraped it fine, put to it as much water as 
will dissolve it. Then beat it half an hour in a mor- 
tar, and put in as much fine^ugar as will sweeten it, 
and a pint and a half of cream. Mill it, and as the 
fi-oth rises, lay it on a sieve. Put the remainder of 
your cream in posset-gls^ses, and lay the fi-othed cream 
upon them. 

Chocolate Cream another Way. 

Scrape two squares of chocolate, and put them 
into a stew-pan, with four ounces of sugar, a pint of 
milk, and half a pint of cream ; let it boil till a third 
is consumed, and when nearly cold, beat up the yolks 
of seven eggs with it, and strain the whole through aj 
sieve. Set your cream over the fire to thicken, but it 
must not boil. 

Pompadour Cream. r 

Beat the whites of five eggs to a strong fi-oth, then 
put them into a pan, with two spoonsful of orange- 
flower water, and two ounces of sugar. Stir it gently 
for three or four minutes, then put it into your dish, .and 
pour melted butter .over it. This must be served up 
hot, and makes a pretty comer dish for a second course 
at dinner. 

Ratijia Cream. 

Take six large laurel leaves, and boil them in a,, 
quart of thick milk with a little ratifia, and when it haa^ 
boiled throw aWay the leaves. Beat the yolks of foor 
eggs with a little cold cream, and sweeten it with sugar 
tp your taste. Then thicken the cream with yonr 
eggs, and set it over the fire again, but do not let it boil. 
Keep stirring it all the time one way, and then povir h -

Basfberry Cream. 

RtJB a qnaort of raspberries, or raspberry-jam, 
through a hah* sieve, to take out the seeds, and then 
mix it well with cream. Sweeten it with -sugar to 
your taste ; then put it into a stone jug, and raise a 
froth with a chocolate mill. As your froth rises, take 
itvoff with a spoon, and lay it upon a hair sieve. When 
you have got as much froth as you want, put what 
cream remains into a deep china dish, or punch-bowl, 
pour your frothed cream upon it as high as it will lie on. 

Ice Cream. 

To a pound of preserved fruit, which may be of 
what kind you choose, add a quart of good cream, the 
juice of two lemons squeezed into it, and some" sugar 
to your palate. Let the whole be rubbed through a 
fine hair sieve, and if raspberry, strawbeflry, or any red 
fruit, you must add a little cochineal to heighten the 
colour: have your freezing pot nice and clean, and 
put your cream into it, cover it, and put it into your 
tub with ice beat smsdl, and some salt; tmm the freez- 
ing pot quick, and as the cream sticks to the sides 
scrape it down with ybur ice spoon, and so on till it is 
froze. The more the cream is worked with the spoon 
the smoother and better flavoured it will be. After it 
is well froze, take it out, and put it into ice shapes 
with fresh salt and ice; when you serve it, carefiilly 
wash the shapes, for fear any salt should adhere to 
theny^; dip them in water luke-warm, and send them 
up to table. 

Fruit Ices may be made either with water or cveam. 
If water, two pounds of fruit, a pint of spring water, 
a pint of clarified sugar, and the juice qf two lemons. 

Chocolate^ coffee^ gingery vanillay biscuit, and 
noyeaUf are all custard ices, and must be set over the 
fii^e like seft creams, and froze like the others 'when the 
custard is cold. Observe, no flour must be used in set 
creams for ices, ,

the jelly up clean. Leave what settling may remam 
at the bottom, and pnt the jelly into a saucepan, with 
a pint of mountain wine, half a pound of loaf-sugar^ 
and the juice of four lemons. Add to these the whites 
of six or eight eggs well beat up ; stir all weU together, 
put it on the fire, and let it boil a few minutes. Pour 
it into a large flannel bag, and repeat it till it runs 
clear ; then have ready a large china basin, and put 
into it some lemon-peel cut as thin as possible. Let 
the jelly run into the basin, and the lemon-peel will 
not only give it a pleasing colour, but a grateful flavouJr. 
Fill your glasses, and it will be fit for use. 

Hartshorn Jelly, 

Boil half a pound of hartshorn in three quarts of 
water over a gentle fire, till it becomes a jelly. If you 
take out a little to cool, and it hangs on a spoon, it is 
enough. Strain it while it is hot, put it into a well-tin- 
ned saucepan, and add to it a pint of Rhenish wine, 
and a quarter of a pound of loaf-sugar. Beat the whites 
of four eggs or more to a froth, stir it altogether that 
the whites may mix well with the jelly, and pour it in 
as if you were cooling it. Let it boil two or three 
minutes, then pqt in the jiiice of three or four lemons, 
and let it boil a minute or two longer, Wl^en it is 
finely curdled, and of a pure white colour,, have ready 
a swan-skin jelly-bag over a china basin, pour in your 
jelly, and pour it back again tiU it is as clear as rock- 
water ; then set a very clean china basin qnder, hav^ 
y«ur glasses as clean as possible*, and wit^i a clean 
spoon fill them . Have ready some thin rind of lemons, 
and when you have filled half your glasses, throw your 
peel into the basin. When the jelly is all run out of 
the bag, with a clean spoon fill the rest of the glasses, 
and they will look of a fine, amber colour. Put in le- 
mon and sugar to your palate, but remember to make 
it pretty sweet, otherwise it will not be palatable.

Orcmge JeUy. 

Take three ounces of isinglass, and aqnart of water, 
let it boil till theT'isinglass is all dissolved, then put in 
three quarters of a pound of fine sugar, the juic§ of 
four lemons, and twelve oranges if small, if large eight; 
let the rinds of six of the oranges be rubbed on some 
sugar, and scraped into your isinglass while boiling; 
when done, strain it through a fine lawn sieve; if you 
have any dried crocus flowers to boil in your jelly it 
will give it a fine yellow tinge, and leave no taste. 

Fruit in Jelly. 

Put into a basin half a pint of clear calf 's feet jelly, 
and when it is«et and stiff, lay in three fine peaches, 
and a bunch of grapes with the stalk upwards. Put 
over them a few vine leaves, and then fill up your bowl 
with jelly. Let it stand till the next day, and then 
set your basin to the brim in hot water. When you 
perceive it gives way from the basin, lay your dish over 
it, turn your jelly carefully out, and serve it to table. 

Btanc Mange. 

There are various methods of making this jelly, 
but the best, and those most usually practised are three ; 
the first of which is termed green, and is prepared fi-om 
isinglass in the following manner : 

Having dissolved your isinglass, put to it two ounces 
of sweet, and the same quantity of bitter almonds, with 
some of the juice of spinach to make it green, and a 
spoonfiil of French brandy. Set it over a stove fire tn 
a saucepan, and let it remain till it is almost ready to 
boil ; then strain it through a gauze sieve, and when it' 
grows thick, put it into a melon mould, let lie till the 
next day, and then turn it out. You may garnish it 
with red and white flowers. 

The second method of preparing this jelly is also fix^m 
isinglass, and must be done thus : put into a quart of 
water an ounce of isinglass, and let it boil till it is re- 
duced to a pint; then put in the whites of four eggs, 
with two spoonsfiil of rice water, and sweeten it to 



your taste. Rtui iti&rMgh a j^y-bag, and then pnt 
to it two ounces of sweet and one onnca'of bitter al- 
monds, divb them a scald in your jelly, and then niB 
them tlirongh a hair sieve* Then pnt it into a china 
bowl, and the next day turn it out. Garnish with 
"flowers or green leayes, and stick all over the top 
blanched almonds cut lengthways. 

The tliird sort of blanc mange is called clear ^ and is 
prepared thus : skim off the fat, and strain a quart of 
strong calf's feet jelly. Then beat th6 whites of four 
eggs, and put them to your jelly. Set it over the fire, 
and keep stirring it till it bolls. Then pour it into a 
jelly*bag, and run it through several times till it is clear. 
Beat an ounce of sweet and the same quantity of bit* 
ter almonds to a paste, with a spoonful of rose-water 
squeezed through a ckrth. Then mix it With the jelly* 
and^dd to it three spoonsful of very good cream. Set 
it again over the fire, and keep stimng it till it almost 
boils. Pour it into a bowl, stir it very often till it is 
almost oold, then wet your moulds, and fill them. 

Jaunmang^. 

TAKfe three quarters of an ounce of isinglass And 
half a pint of water bailed together till the isingla^ is' 
just dissolved, then put in the rind and jnice of a kmon, 
half a pint of mountain wine, and sugar to your palate ; 
after it is all boiled tc^ther, let it stand tfll almost 
e^dr then add four yolks of eggs. Put it again on the 
fire, till it almost boils, then strain it through a fine 
lawn sieve, and keep storing it till edki. 

Black Currant Jelly. 

Let your currants be thoroughly ripe, ahd quite 
dry; strip them clear fix>m the stalks, sLnd put them 
into a large stew-pot. To every ten quarts of eurrimts 
put one quart of water. Tie papet close over them, 
and set them for two hours in a cool oVen. Then 
squeease therai through a very fine cloth, and to every 
quart oi juiee add a pound and a half of loaf-(kugaf 
tooben ioio small pieees. g^tir it gdMly tiil the sugar

clesiu, , Let it. boil pretty quick over, a clear fire, till it 
jellies,, which is known by dipping the sidmmer into 
your jelly and holding it in the air; when it hangs to 
the spoon in a drop, it is done. You may also put 
spme, into a plate to try, and if there comes a thick 
skin, it is done. If the jelly is boiled too long it will 
lose its flavour, and shrink very much. Pour it into 
pots, cover them with brandy papers, and keep them 
in a dry place. Red and white jelly is made in the 
saj»^ manper« 

Riband Jelly. 

Takb out the great bones of four calf's feet, and 
put the meat into a pot with ten quarts of water, tliree 
gm^c^, of hartshorn, the same quantity of isinglass, a 
nutm^ quart^ei^, and four blades of mace. Boil it 
till it comes to two quarts, then strain it through a flan- 
nel b9g> smd let it stand twenty^four hours. Then 
scrape off aU. the fat firom the top very clean, slice the 
jelly, and put to it the whites of six eggs beaten to a 
froth. Boil it a little, and strain it through a^flannel 
bag. Then run the jelly into little hjigh glasses, and 
run every colour as thick as your finger ; but observe, 
that one colour must be thoroughly cold before you put 
qn Another ; and that which you put on must be blood- 
warm, otherwise they will mix together. You must 
colour red with cochineal, green with spinach, yellow 
with saffix>n, blue with ^yrup of violets, and white with 
thiiek crieam. 

Savoury Jelly. 

Take some thin slices of lean veal and ham, and 
put them into a stew-pan, withi a carrot or turnip, and 
two or three onions. - Cover it, and let it sweat on a 
slow fire till it is of a deep brown cok)ur. Then put 
to it a quart of very clear broth, some whole pepper, 
mace, a little isin^beiss, and salt to your palate. Boil . 
it ten minutes, then strain it, skim off all the fat, and. 
put to it the whites of three e^. Then run it seve- . 
ral times through ^a jelly-bag till it is perfectly dear,

this part of the Art of Confectionary, and which t^ 
shall previously notice as well for the instmetion as 
reputation of those whose province it may he occasioo^- 
ally to use such articles. In the first place remember^ 
' that in making your syrqps, the sugar is well poundei^ 
and dissolved before you set it on the fire, wMch wi**. 
not only make the scum rise well, but cause the syrup 
t6 have its proper colour* When you preserve cherriesv 
damsons, or any other kind of stcme fi^it, cover them 
with mutton-suet rendered, in order to keep oat the 
air, which, if it penetrate^ will totally destroy them. 
All wet sweetmeats must be kept in a dry and cool 
place, as they will be subject to grow mouldy and 
damp, and too much heat will destroy their virtue. 
Dip writing paper into brandy, lay it close to the 
sweetmeats,, cover them quite tight with paper^ and 
they will keep for any length of time without reoeivia^ 
the least injury. Without these > precautions^ all ar% 
and endeavours will prove ineffectual. , 

ApHcof^. ^ 

Gather your apricots before your stones become* 
hard, put them into a pan of cold spring water wUh^ 
plenty of vine leaves; set them over a silow fire till, 
they are quite yellow, then take them out, £(nd rub . 
them with a flannel anjJ salt to take ofi* the linL Pijt 
them into the pan to 1;he same water and leaves, go-, 
ver them close, set them at a good distance from, the, 
fire till they are a fine light green, then take them 
carefully up, and pick out all the bad-coloured apd 
broken ones. BoU the best gently ^ two or three timp^t 
in a thin syfup, and let them be quite cold each tim^ i 
before you boil them. When they look plump and j 
clear, make a syrup of double-refined sugar, but not 
too thick ; give your apricots a gentle boil in it, and 
then put them into your pots or glasses. Dip paper 
in brandy, lay it over them, tie it close, and keep them 
in a dry place for use.

•and cover them with French brandy. Tie a bladder 
over them, and let them stand a week. Then take 
them oQt, and make a strong syrup for them. Boil 
.and. skim it well, then put in your peaches, anid boil 
them till they look clear; then take them out, and 
^nt them, into pbts or glasses. Mix the syrup with the 
brandy, and when it is cold, pour it on your peaches. 
Tie them so close down with a bladder, that no air 
can oome to them, otherwise they will turn black, and 
be totally spoiled. 

Quinces. 

These may be preserved either whole or in quar- 
tans, and must be done thus : pare them very thin and 
roand, put them into a saucepan, fill it with hard wa* 
tor, and lay the parings over the quinces to keep them 
down. Cover your saucepan close, that none of the 
steam may get out, set them over a slow fire till they 
are soft, and of a fine pink colour, and then let them 
stand 4;ill they are cold. Make a good syrup of dou- 
ble refined sugar, and boil, and skim it well; then 
put in your quinces, let them boil ten minutes, take 
them off, and let them stand two or three hours. 
Then boil them till the syrup looks thick, and the 
qninces clear. Put them into deep jars, with the 
syrup, and cover them close with brandy-paper and. 
leather. 

Barberries. 

To preserve barberries for tarts, you must proceed . 
thus : pick the female branches clean from the stalk; , 
take their weight of loaf sugar, and put them into a 
jar. Set them in a kettle of boiling water till the 
sngar is melted, and the barberries quite soft, and then 
let them stand 411 night. The next day put them into*] 
a preserving pan, and boil them fifteen minutes, thea!| 
piit them into jars, tie them close, and set them by for 
. use. 

If you intend to preserve your barberries in bunches 
you must ptoceed as follows : having procured thp

Green Gage Plums. 
Get the finest plums you can, gathered just before 
they are ripe. Put a layer of vine-leaves at the bot- 
t3om of your pan, then a layer of plums, and then vihe- 
leaves and plums alternately, till the pan is nearly fill- 
ed. Then put in as much water as it will hold, set 
it over a aikrw fire, and when the plums are hot, and 
begin to or^ck, take them off, and pare off the skins 
very carefully, putting them into a sieve, as you do 
them* Then lay them in the same water, with a 
layer of leaves between as you did at first, and cover 
them so close that no steam can get out. Hang them 
at a great distance fi'om the fire till they are green, 
which will take at least five or six hours. Then take 
them carefully up, lay them on a hair sieve to drain, 
make a gopd syrup, and give them a gentle boil in it 
twice a day for two days. Then take them out, put 
them into a fine clear syrup, and cover them close 
down with brandy-paper. 

Oranges. 
Take what number of Seville oranges you think 
proper, cut a hole at the stalk endi of each* about the 
size of a sixpence, and scoop out the pulp quite clean; 
tie them separately in pieces of muslin, and lay them 
in spring water fi)r two days. Change the water twice 
every day, and then boil them in the muslin on a slow 
fire till they are quite tender. As the water wastes, 
j^t miore h9t .water intq the pan<» and keep them co- 
Tered|>. Weigh the oranges before you scoop them, and

the juice of the oranges to a syrnp, skim it well, let it 
«tand till it is cold, then tslke the oranges ont of the 
Mnslin, put thera into the pan, and let them boil half 
«u hour. If they are not quite cleai-, boil them once 
a day for two or three days. Then pare and core 
eome green pippins, and boil them till the water is 
^rongjof the apple ; but do not stir them, and only put 
them. down with the back of a spoon. ^Strain the war 
ter through a jelly-bag till it is quite clear, and then to 
every pint of water put a pound of double-refined sugar, 
and the juice of a lemon strained fine. Boil it up to a 
strong jelly, drain the oranges out of the syrup, and 
put them into glass jars, or pots the size of an orange, 
with the holes, upwards. Pour the jelly over them, 
cpv^ them with papers dipped in brandy, and tie them 
close down with a bladder. You may preserve lemons 
in the same maimer. 

RcLspbemes. 

Gather your raspberries on a dry day, when they 
are just turning red, with the stalks on abot^t an inch 
lo^g. Lay them singly on a dish, then beat and sift 
their weight of douWe-refined sugar, and strew it over 
them. To evary quart of raspberries take a quart of 
red-currant juice, and put to it its weight of double- 
refined sugar. .Boil and dam it well, then put in your 
raspberries, and give them a scald. Take them off, 
and let them stand for two hours. Then set them on 
again, and make them a little hotter. Proceed in this 
manner two or three times till they look clear; but do 
not Jet them boil, as that will make the stalks come off. 
When they are tolerably cool, put them in jelly-glasses 
with the stalks downwards. White raspberries must 
be preserved in the same manner, only observing, that 
instead of sred you use white-currant juice.

If you preserve red gooseberries, you must proceed ' 
thus : put a pound of loaf-sugar into a preserving-pan, 
with as much water as will dissolve it, and boil and 
skim a well. Then put in a quart of rough red goose- 
berries, and let them boil a little. Set them by till 
the next day, and then boil them till they look clear,

Dried Apricots 

Tare as many apricots as will amount to about a 
pound weight, pare and stone them, and then put them

lay the rest over them. When they have been twenty- 
four hours in this state, turn them three or four times 
in the syrup, and then boil them pretty quick till they 
look cl^r. When they are cold^^ take thetti out, and 
kythem on glasses. Then put them into a stove, and 
turn them the first day every half hour, the second 
day every hour, and so on till they are perfectly dry. 
Pt(t them into boxes covered, and slet them by for use.

covered with syrup, or they will lose their colour. 
Let them stand all night, and then make a ridi syrup 
thus : to a pound of double-refined sugar put i;wo 
spoonsful of water, skim it well, and boil it almost to a 
candy. . When it is cold, drain your plums out of the 
first syrup, and put them into the thick syrup; but be 
careful to let the syrup cover them. Set them on ttie 
fire to scald till they look clear, and then put them into 
a china bowl. When they have stood a week, then take

To every pound of marmalade put a pound and a half 
of double-refined sugar, finely beaten, ^and boil them 
together gently for twenty minutes ; but if not clear 
and transparent in that time boil it five or six minutes 
longer. Keep stirring it gently all the time, and take 
care you do not break the slices. When it is cold, put

the middle, to take ont the fruit, arid there must also 
be made a frame of wood to fix them in. Great care 
must be taken to make the tins very smooth in the in- 
side, otherwise their roughness will mark the fruit ; 
and that they be made Texactly of .the shape of the fruit 
that they are intended to represent. Being prepared 
with your tins, proceed thus : take two cow-heels, and 
a, calf's foot, boU them in a gallon of soft water^till they 
are all boiled to rags, and when you have a full quart 
of jelly, straih it through a sieve. Then put it into a 
saucepan, sweeten it, put in a lemon-peel perftimed, 
and colour it like the fruit you intend to imitate. Stir" 
all together, give it a boil, and fill your tins : then put 
in the stones and the stalks just as the fruit grows, and 
when the jelly is quite cold, open your tins, and put 
on the bloom, which may be done by carefully dusting' 
on powder-blue. Keep them covered to prevent the 
dust getting to them ; and to the . eye, art will be an 
excellent substitute for nature.

A Dish of Snow. 

Take twelve large apples, and put them into a 
saucepan with cold water. Set them over a slow fire, 
and when they are soft, pour them into a hair sieve; 
take off the skins, and put the pulp into a basin. Then 
beat the whites of twelve ^gs to a very strong froth ; 
beat and sift half a pound of double-^refined sugar, and 
strew it into the eggs. Work up the pulp of your ap- 
ples to a strong froth, then beat them altogether till 
they are like a stiflf snow. Lay it upon a china dish, 
and heap it up as high as you can. Set round it green 
knots oi paste, in imitation of Chinese rails, and stick 
a sprig of myrtle in the middle of the dish.

pour the moonshine into the dish ; and when -it is quite 
cold, take out the tins. Then fill up the vacancies 
with dear calf s feet jelly. You may colour yqur 
moonshine with cochineal and chocolate, to make it 
look like the -dcy, and your moon and stars will then 
shine the brighter. Garnish it with rock candy sweet- 
meats. • 

Floating, Island. 

Ta,kb a soap-dish of a size proportioned to what 
you intend to make : but a deep glass set on a china 
di»h will answer the purpose better. Take a quart of 
the thickest cream you can get, and make it pretty 
sweet with fine sugar. Pour in a gill of sacjj^, grate 
in the yellow rind of a lemon, and mill the cream till 
it is of a thick fix)th : then carefully pour the thin firom

inches broad at the top ; then colojir it, and set it in 
the middle of a deep china dish. Set a cast figure on 
it with a crown on its head, and a knot of rock candy 
at its feet: then make a roll of paste an inch thick, 
and stick it on the inner edge of the dish, two parts 
round. Cat e^ht pieces of eringo-roots, about three 
inches long, and iix them upright to the roll of paste 
on the edge.. Make gravel walks of shot comfits round 
the dish, and set small figure in them. Roll out some 
paste, and cut it open like Chinese rails. Bake it, and 
fix it on either side of the gravel walks with gum, and 
form an entrance where the Chinese rails are, with 
two pieces of eringo-root for pillars. 

Chinese Temple, or Obelisk^ 
Take an ounce of fine sugar, half an ounce of but- 
ter, and four ounces of fine flour; Boil the sugar and 
buttei- in a little water^ and when it is cokd, beat up an 
egg, and put it to the water, sugar, and butter. Mix 
it with the flour, and make it into a very stiff" paste ; 
then roll it as thin as possible, have a set of tins in the 
form of a temple, and put the. paste upon them. Cut 
it in what form you please upon the separate parts of 
your tins, keeping them separate till baked; but take 
care to have, the paste exactly the size of the tins. 
When you have cut all these parts, bake them in a 
slow oven,^ and when cold, take them out of ttie tins, 
and join the parts with strong isinglass and water with 
a cameFs hair brush. Set them oqe upon the other, 
as the forays of the tin moulds will direct you. If y#a 
cut it neatlj, and the paste is rolled vary lliio^ it will 
be a beautiful comer for a large taUe. If you hs^ve^ 
obelisk moulds, you may m^e them the same wayir 
for an opposite comer. Be careful to make the pillars 
stronger than the top, ihat they may not be crushed 
by liieir weight.

CHAPTER XXL 

P ICKLIJVO. 

PICKLES are essentially necessary to be kept in 
all houses^ but particularly such as oontain large temi- 
lies; nor will the prudent and judicious housekeeper 
be without them ; and this for two reasons; first, to 
avoid the inconvenience of sending for them when 
wanted ; and secondly, from being assured that they are 
done a$ they ought to be, ^at is, that they shall have 
their proper colour without that artifice which is likely 
to be prejudicial to those who use them. It is too 
common a practice to make use of brass utensils in 
order to give the pickles a fine green ; but this perni- 
cious custom is easily avoided by heating the liquor, 
and keeping it in a proper degree of warmth before' 
you pour it on the articles to be pickled. It is usual ' 
to put pickles into earthen jars, but stone jars are by 
far the best, for though they are more expensive in the 
first purchase, they will be found much cheaper in the 
end ; the earthen vessels are porous, and will conse- 
quently admit the air, and spoil the pickles, especially 
if they stand any length of time; but this will not be 
the case with stone jars. Remember, that when you 
take any pickle out of your jars, be surenever to do it J 
with your fingers, as that will spoil the pickle; but' 
always make use of a spoon, which you should keep 
entirely for that purpose. 

Having mentioned these necessary and general ob- \ 
servatidns relative to pickling, we shall now proceed 
to particulars, beginning with / 

Mangoes. , 

The proper cucumbers to be used for this purpose 



, PkOKLIKO. 275 

are fitdse ^theki^M so^ wUch must be taken 6tfm 
the yines before they are too ripe, or yellow at the ends. 
Gal a piece oat df the side, and take out the seeds with« 
a» apple-scraper or a tea-spoon. Then put them into 
very strong salt and water for eight or nine days, or 
till ^;hey are yellow. Stir them well two or three times 
every day, and pat them into a pan with a large qoan^ 
tity of vine leaves both over and tinder them. Beat 
a little roach alum very fine, and put it into the salt and 
water they came out of Pour it on joiir cacambers, 
and set them on a very abw fire for four or five hours 
till they are pretty green. Then take them out, and 
drain them in a hair sieve, and when they are cold, 
put to them a little horse-radish, then Aiustard-seed, 
two «: three heads of garlic, a few pepper-corns, a few 
green cucumbers sliced in small pieces, then horse- 
radish, and the same as before-mentioned, till you have 
filled them. Then take the piece you cut out, and 
sew it on with a large needle and thread, and do all 
the rest in the same manner. Have ready the follow- 
ing pickle : to e^ery gallon of vinegar put an ounce of 
mace, the same of cloves, two ounces of sliced ginger, 
the same of long pepper, Jamaica pepper, three ounces 
of mustard-seed tied up in a bag, four ounces of garlic, 
and a stick of horse-radish cut in slices. Boil them 
five minutes in the vinegar, then pour it upon your 
pickles, tie them down close, and keep them for use. 

Girkins. 

Put a quantity of spring water into a laig© earthen 
pan, and to every gallon put two pounds ofsalt. Mix 
them well together, and throw in five hundred girkins. 
When they have been two hours in the salt and watar, 
take them out, and put them to drain ; and when tibiey 
are thoroughly dry, put them into your jar. Take a gal- 
lon of the. best white wine vinegar, and put it in a 
saucepan, with half an ounce of cloves and mace, an 
ounce of aUspice, the same quantity of mustafd-seed, a 
stick of hOTs6-radish cut in slices, six bay-leaves, two 
ortkree rac€» of ginger, a nutmeg cut in fneceSi and a 



2?6 PICKLIHQ. ^ 

handfiil of »al*. Bofl xvp all together, jand pour it over 
the girkins. Cover them close down, and let them 
^tand twenty-four hours. Then put them into your 
saucepan, and let them simmer over the iSre till they 
are green; but be careful not to let them boU, as that 
will spoil them. Then put them into your jar, and 
cover them down close till they are . cold. Then tie 
thenf ov^ with a bladder and a piece of leather, and 
put them in a dry cold place. 

Cucumbers. 

For the purpose of pickling, choose the smallest 
cucumbers you can get/ and be careful they are as free 
from spots as possible. Put them into strong ^alt and 
water for nine or ten days, or till they are quite yellow, 
and stir them twice a day, at least, or they will grow 
soft. When they are perfectly yellow, pour the water 
from them, and cover them with plenty of vine leaves. 
Set your water over the fire, and when it boils, pour 
it upon them, and set them upon the hearth to keep 
warm. When the water is nearly cold, make it boiling 
hot again, and pour it upon them. Proceed in this 
manner till you perceive they are of a fine green, which 
they will be in four or five times. Be carefiil to k;eep 
them well covered with vine leaves, with a cloth and 
dish over the top to keep in the steam, which will 
help to green them the sooner. When they are 
greened, put them into a hair sieve to drain, and then 
• make the following pickle for them : to every two 
quarts of white wine vinegar, put Jialf an ounce of 
mace, or ten or twelve cloveg, an ounce of ginger cut 
into slices, the same of black pepper, and a handfiil of 
salt. Boil them all together for five minutes, pour it 
hot upon your pidcles, and tie them down with a blad- 
der for use. 

Cucumbers in slices. 

Take some large cucumbers before they are too 
ripe, slice them of the thickness of a crown-piece, and 
put thepi into a pewter dish. To every dozen of en- ^ 



combers slice two large omons thin, and so on till you 
have filled your dish, or have got the quantity you in- 
tend to pickle ; but remember to put a handral of salt 
between every row. Then cover them with another 
pewter dish, and let them stand twenty-four hours. 
Then pat them into a cullender, and when they are 
thoroughly dry, put them into a jar, coijer them over 
with white wine vinegar, and let them stand four Hours. 
Pour the vinegar from them into a saucepan, and boil 
it with a little salt. Put to the cucumbers a Uttle 
mace, a little whole pepper, a large race of ginger 
sliced, and then pour on them the boiUng vinegar. 
Cover them close, and when they are cold, tie them 
down, and they will be ready for use in a few days. 

To Keep Cucumbers. 

Choose those that are small, and not too old; put 
them in jars, and pour over a brine like the French 
beans ; (see p. 281 ;) when you use them take the rind 
off, and dress.them in the same manner as others. 

Walnuts. 

Th£R£ are various methods of pickling walnuts, 
in order to have them of different colours, the number 
of which are four, namely, black, white, olive colour, 
and green; each of which we shall describe in their 
proper order. ^ 

To pickle walnuts black, you must gather them be- 
fore the shells get too hard, which may be known by 
running a pin into them, and always gather them when 
the sun is hot upon them. Put them into strong salt 
and water for nine days, and stir them twice a day, 
-observing to change the salt and water every three 
days. Then put them^into a hair sieve, and let them 
stand in* the air till they turn black. Put them into 
strong stone jars, and pour boiling vinegar over them; 
cover them up, and let them stand till they are cold. 
Then give the vinegar three more boilings, pour it each 
lime on the walnuts, and let it stand till it is cold be- 
tween every boiling. Then tie them down with paper

months. When that time has ej^^psed, tafce them out 
of t.hie vioegar, and make a pickle foF them thus : to 
every two quarts of vinegar put half an ounce of maee, 
and the same of cloves ; of black pepper, Jamaica pep- 
per, Jong pepper, and ginger, aa ounce each* and two 
.^ ounces ot common salt. Boil it ten miA^tas, then 
pour it hot bi\ your walnut^, tie them clo^ down, and 
cQxef them with paper and e^ liaddear^

water and a handful of salt as you do theis. Let . 

them lie in the. water six hours, and put a thin board 

«ipon them to kaep them uni^r.tba water^r. 'J^i^m set 

^ a stew-p^n with some clea# spring wa^ o^ a^t^har- 

coal fire. Take yow puts out of thl^ wat^^ put them 

* into the stew-pan, and let them WJWW ^rjOr Jfc^e 

minutes, but be careful they do not boil. Then have 

ready a pan of spring water with a handful of salt in it, 

c^nd stir it till the s^t is mejted ; then t^k^ ywr'ttuts 

out of the stew-pan with a woodep J^udJke, or .^(Ooq, 

and put them into the wjd water and salt;.. Let 4h^in 

stand a quarter of an hpur, with the hoard lying (W

them on a ^loth, and put them into yaoy jar, with 

sonie blades of mace and nutmeg sliped thin. Mix 

your spice between your nuts, and pour distilled yme* 

gar over them . When , your jar is propeyrly filled with 

mits, pour mutton fat over them, tie them d^wn dose 

with a bladder and leather, and set them in a dry 

place. • : 

Walnuts to be picUed of a^ qUvc co/^ou^^ must be 
managed thus; having gathered your walnuts, with 
the same precautions as bejfore directed, put them into 
strong aje allegar, and tie them down un^er a bladdw 
and paper to keep out the air. Let them sta»d twistea 



i^Qnl^, thexk take them out of tlie c^egiftr, uad make 
^or them a pickle of strong allegar. To every quart, 
put half an ounce of Jamaica pepper, the same of long 
pepper, a quarter of an ounce of mace, the same of 
cloves, a head of garlic, and a little salt. Boil theqi 
altogether five or six minutes, and then pour it upcm 
your walnuts. As it gets cold, boil it aga^n three tim^$, 
and pour it on them. Then *ie them d0wn with a 
bladder, and paper over it ; and if ybur a^l^gar m goo<J, 
they wiU k^ep several yearSn. w^ttioqt either turning 
* colour or growing spft. Von may make very goad cat- 
sup of the allegar that comes from the w^^lnu^ls, by add- 
ing a pound of anchovies, an ounc^ of clov^ the same 
of long and black pepper, a head of garlic, and half a 
pound of common salt, to ev^y gallon of allegar. Boil 
it till it is ^hfidf reduced, and «kim it well. TRiefa bot- 
'tle it &r USB, and it will keep a gre^it whife. 

To piekle waiimte greeny proceed asfoltews : make 
-use df the large double or French Walnuts, gathered 
befi)re the shells ai^ hard. Wrap them singly iii vine 
leav^, put a few vine leaves in the bottom of youl- jar, 
and nearly fill it with your walnuts. Take care they 
do ndt lonoh one another, and put a good many leaves 
orer them. Then fill your jar with good aHegar, cover 
them dose iliai die air cannot get in, and let them 
aitand for three weeks. Then pour the allegar from 
tioiem, put ftesk leaves at the bottom of another jar, 
take out your wafaiuts, and wrap them separately In 
fresh leaves as iquick as possibly you can. Put them 
into your jar with a good many leaves over them,^ and 
fill it with white tvine vinegar. Let them stand three 
W^ks, pour off your vinegar, and wrap tliem np as 
bi^foi?^, with fre^ leaves at the bottom and top of your" 
ji^. Take fresh white wine vinegar, piit salt in it till 
it will bear an egg, and add to it mace, doves, nutmeg, 
^d gfiriic. Boll it about eight minutes, and then pour 
It on your walnuts. Tie them close with a paper and 
a btedd^, aad set them by for xsse. Be careful to keep

a^dn into the jar, ^r by that means the whole may 
be spoiled. 

Red Cabbdge. 
Slice your cabbage crossways, then put it on an 
earthen 3ish, and sprinkle a handful of salt over it. 
Cover it vv^ith another ^ish, and let it stand twenty- 
four hours. Then put it into a cullender to drain, and 
lay it into your jar. Take a sufficient quantity of white 
wine vinegar to cover it, a few cloves, a little mace, 
and allspice. Put them in whole, with a little cochi- 
neal bruised fine. Then boil it up, and pour it either 
hot or cold upon your cabbage. If the former, let it 
stand till cold, and then tie it down for use. 

Onions. 

Take a sufficietit nomb^ of the smallest onions 
you can get, and put them into salt anil water for nine 
days, obsiarving to change the water every .day. Then 
put them into jars, and pour fi'esh boihng salt and wa- 
ter over them. Let them stand close covered till they 
are cold, then make some more salt and water, and 
pom* it boiling hot upon them. When it is cold, put 
your onions into a hair sieve to drain, then pat them 
into wide-mouthed bottles, and fill them up withdnt- 
tilled vinegar. Put into every bottle a dice or two of 
ginger> a blade of mace, a tea^spoouful of sweet oil, 
(which will keep the onions white,) a ibay*^!^, and as 
much salt as will lay on a sixpence. Cork them wdil 
up, so that no air can get to them, and set them la ft 
dry place. • . 

Samphire. 

Take what quantity of green samphire you think 
propar, put it into a clean pan, throw over it frK^ ^ 
three handsful of salt, and cover it with spring^wat^. 
When it has lain twenty-four hoors,^ put it into ia deaii 
saucepan, throw in a handful of salt, and-cover it Witii; 
good vinegar. Cover the pan close, set it over a skrw^ 
fire, let it stand till it is just green and crisp, and then 
take it off at that moment; for should it remain till it 
is soft, it win be totally spoiled. Put it into yotor 



PICKLIKG. ' 23. 

pifcfcling-pot, and cover it close. When it is quite cold, 
tie it down with a bladder and leather, and set it by 
for use. . Samphire may be preserved all the year by 
keeping it in very strong brine of salt and water, and, 
just before you want to use it, put it for a few minutes 
into some of the best vinegar. 

Kidney Beans. 
Take some young small beans, and put them into 
strong salt and water for three days, stirring them two 
or three times each day. Then put them into a pan 
with vine leaves both under and over them, and pour 
on them the same water they came. out of Cover 
them close, and set them over a very slow fire till they 
are of a fine green. Then put them into a hair sieve 
to drain, and make a pickle for them of white Avine 
vinegar, or fine ale allegar. Boil it five or six minutes 
with a little mace, Jamaica pepper, and a race or two 
of ginger sliced. Then pour it hot upon the beans, 
and tie them down with a bladder and paper. 

To preserve French Beans. 
Take any quantity of French beans you think fit, 
choosing those that are tender and least stringy; hav- 
ing cut off the ends, boil them a quarter of an hour, 
and shift them into cold water ; then dry them, and put 
them into the jars in which you mean to keep them. 
Pour over your brine till it rises to the rim of the jar, 
then put over some butter that has been heated and is 
half cold, which will congeal upon the French beans, 
and keep them froih the air. If you do not like to put 
butter you must put mutton suet in the same way. 
To make the brine, you must take two thirds water 
and one of vinegar; add seraral pounds according to 
the quantity of brine you would mstke, a pound to three 
pints. Set it over the fire till the salt is melted ; let 
it settle, and before you use it pour it off clear. 

Barberries. 
Take a quantity of barberries not over ripe, pick 
off the leaves and dead stalks, and put them into jars, 

Nn 1«> 



with a >arge quairijty of strong salt and water, and tie 
them down with a bladder. When you sefe a scum 
rise on the barberries, put them into fresh salt and wa-^ 
ter ; but they need no vinegar, thek own natural sharp«t 
ness being fully sv^cient to pi^eserve them. Qovejp 
them close, and set them by for use. 

Beet Roots. 
Boil the roots till they are tender, and take off the 
skins, cut them in slices, gimp them in the shape of ' 
wheels, or what other form you please, and put them 
into a jar. Take as much vinegar as you think will 
cover them, and boil it with a little mace,, a face of 
ginger sliced, and a fe\t small pieces of horse-radish. 
Pour it .hot upon the roots, and tie them down close. 

Radish Pods. 
Gather your radish pods when tliey sire quite 
young, and put them into salt and water all mght; the 
next day boil the salt and water they were laid m, pour' 
it upon the pods, and cover your jar close to keep in 
the steam. When it is nearly cold, make it boiling hot, 
and pour it on again, and continue doing so till the 
pods are quite green. TThen putthem into a sieve to 
drain, and make a pickle for them of white wine vine- 
gar, with a little mace, ginger, long pepper, and horse- 
radish. Pour it boiling hot upon your pods, and when 
it is almost cold, make your vinegar twice as hot as 
before, and pour it upon them. Tie them down with^ 
a bladder, and set them in a dry place. 

Cauliflowers. 
Take the whitest and closest e^nliiowerd yon can 
get, bredk the fk)wers into bunched, and spreail them 
on an earthen dish. Lay salt all over them, and let 
them stand for three days to dra^ out all the water. 
Then put 4&em into jars, and pour boiling salt and 
water upon them. Let them stand all night, then, 
drain them in a hair sieve, and put them into glass jars.

tle mace and sliced nutmeg between, and fill them with 
distilled vinegar. Cover them with mutton fat melted, 
and tie them down witli leather and a bladder. - 

To preserve Artichokes. 

They may be quartered, the chokes taken out, and 
done exactly the same as the French beans. 

Nasturtiums. 

The most proper time for gathering the berries is 
soon after the blossoms are gone off. Put them into 
cold salt and water, and change the water for three 
days successively. Make your pickle of \vhite wine 
vinegar, mace, nutiileg sliced, shalots, pepper-corns, 
salt, and horse-radish. Make your pickle pretty strong, 
but do not boil it. When you have drained your ber- 
ries, put them into a jar, pour the pickle to them, and 
tie them down close. 

Mushrooms. 

Takb the smallest mushrooms you can get, put 
them into spring water, and rub them with a piece of 
hew flannel dipped in salt. Throw them into cold wa-

colour; then put them into a saucepan, and throw a 
handful of salt over them. Cover them close, and set 
them over the fire four or five minutes, or till you, find • 
they are thoroughly hot, and the liquor is dra%vn out 
from them. Then lay them between two clean cloths 
till they are cold, put them into glass bottles, and fill 
them up with distilled vinegar. Put a J)lade or two of 
mace arid a tea-spoonful of sweet oil into every bot- 
tle. Cork them up close, and set them in a cool place. [ 
If you have not any distilled vinegar, you may use '

it is quite cold, bottle it for use; 

Mushroom Powder. 

Get the largest and th^ thickest buttons yoti can, 
peel them, and cut oflF the root end, but do not wa^ 
them. Spread them separately on pewter dishes, and 
set them in a slow oven to dry. Let the liquor dry 
up into the -mushrooms, as tiiat will make thfe powder 
much stronger, and let them continue ih the oven till 
you find they will powdtar. Th«a beat them in a mar- 
ble mortay, and sift them through a fine sieve, with a 
Uttle chyan pepper and pounded mace. Bottle it quite

Chapes. 

Let your grapes be of their full growth, but not ripe. 
Cut them into small bunches fit for garnishing, and 
put them into a stone jar, with vine-leaves between 
every layer of grapes. Then take spring water, as 
much as will cover them, and put into it a pound of 
bay salt, and as much white salt as will make it bear 
^mtsgg. Dry your bsiy salt, and pound it be£n*e you 



pot it ii^ and that wiU mske it melt the Monnr^ Fat

tween every bunch of grapes, and on the top. Then 
pour the clear of the pickle on the grapes, fill vour jar 
that the pickle may be above the graf^es, and having 
tied a thin piece, of board in a flannfel, lay it on the top 
of the Jar, to keep the grapes under the liquor. Tie 
them down with a bladder and leather, and when you 
want them for use, take them out with a wooden spoon.' 
Be careful you tie them up again quite close, for, 
should the air get in, they will be inevitably spoiled. 

Red Currants.

pieces all over with the seasoning, fry them brown in 
oil, and let them stand till they are cold. Then put 
them iota vinegar, and cover them, with oil. If well 
covered) they will keep a considersiUe time, and are 
most delicions eating. 

Smelts. 
At that time of the year when smelts are seasons* 
bly abundant, take a quarter of a peck of them, and, 
wash, clean, and gut them. Take half an ounce of 
pepper, the same quantity of nutmegs,. a quarter of 
an ounce of mace, half an ounce of saltpetre, and 
a quarter of a pound of common salt. Beat all very

CHAPTER XXIL 

COLLARIJ^O. 

ONE very material thing to be generally and indis- 
pensably observed in the business of collaring any kind 
qf meat is, that you rbll it up well, and bind it as tight 
as p6!i6fbiie, otherwise when it is cut it will break in 
pieces, and its beauty be entirely lost. * Be careful that 
you boil it enough, but not too much, and let it be ^uiie 
cold before you put it into the pickle. AAer it has 
lain all night in the pickle, take off the bindingi piit it 
into a dish, and when it is cut, the skin will look dear, 
and the nfieat have its proper solidity. 

Venison.

finger, and three of four inches long. Season your * 
veniaon witiir p^penp, salt, cloves, and nuthieg. Roll

your clarified butter at the bottom; then pat in your 
%''enison, and fill up your pot with clarified butter,, and 
be sure that your butter be. an inch above the meat* 
When it is thoroughly cold, tie it down with double 
paper, and lay a tile on the top. They will keep six 
or eight months ; and you may, when yon use a pot, 
put it for a minute into boiUng water, and it will come

Another method pf .potting, beef, and w^hich will* 
greatly imitate yeftisopi, is this : Take, a botipek ksS'^ 
beef, and ,fjutjt|^ jejaft <?£ it ^ into pie^s of abo^.a 



FomiTG. est 

potind wei^t each. To eight poimdf of l^eef take 
k>ur ounces of saltpetre, the samtf quantity of baj-saltt 
half a ponnd of white salt, and an ounce of sal pru- 
nella. Beat all Ihe salt very fine, mix them wdl to- 
gether, and rub them into the beef. Then let it lie 
four days, turning it twice a day. After th^ put it 
into a pan, and cover it with pump water, and a little 
of its own brine. Send it to the oven, and bake it till 
it is tender; then drain it from the gravy, and takeout 
all the skin and sinews. Pound the meat well in a 
mortar, lay it in a broad dish, and mix on itan ounce 
of cloves and mace, three quarters of an ounce of pep- 
per, and a nutmeg, all beat very fine. Mix the whole 
well with the meat, and add a little clarified fresh butter 
to moisten it. Then press it down into pots very hard, 
set them at the mouth of the oven just to settle, and 
then cover them two inches thick with clarified butter. 
When quite cold, cover the pots over with white pa- 
per tied close, and set them in a dry place. It wOl 
keep good a considerable time. 

Pigeons. ' 

Pick and draw your pigeons, cut off the pinions, 
wash them clean, and put them in a* sieve to drain. 
Then dry them with a cloth, and season them with 
pepper and ssdt. Roll a lump of butter in chopped 
parsley, and put it into the pigeons. Sew up the vents, 
then put them into a pot with butter over them, tie 
them down, and set them in a moderately heated oven. 
When they come out, put them into your pots, and 
pour clarified butter over them. 

Woodcocks. 

Take six woodcocks, pluck them, and draw out 
the train. Skewer their bills through their thighs, 
put their legs through each other, and their feet upon 
their breasts. Season them with three or four blades ' 
of mace, and a little pepper and salt. Then put them 
into a deep pot, with a pound oi butter over them, 
and tie a strong paper over tfa^m. Bak^ thmi in a 



moderstte osren, and when they are eaoii|^> lav theqi 
on a dish to draiiFthe gravy from them, then put them 
into potting-pots; take all theclear butter from your 
gravy, and put it upon them. Fill up your pots with 
clarified butter. Keep them in a dry place for use. 
Snipes must be done in the same manner. 



SECT. IL 

PISH. 

Take a large eel, and when you have skinned, 
washed clean, and thoroughly dried it with a cloth, 
cut it into pieces about four inches long. Season them 
with a little beaten mace and nutmeg, pepper, salt, 
and a little sal prunella beat fine. Lay them in a pan, 
and pour as much clarified butter over them as will 
cover tliem. Bake them half an hour in a quick oven ; 
but the size of yom: eels must be the general rule to 
determine what time they will take baking. Take 
them out with a fork, and lay them on a coarse cloth 
to drain. When they are quite cold, season them again 
with the like seasoning, and lay them close in the pot. 
Tlien take off the butter they were baked in clear from 
the" gravy of the fish, and set it in a dish before the fire. 
When it is melted, pour the butter over them, and 
put them by for use. You may bone your eels, if you 
choose ; but in that case you must put in no sal prunella. 

Salmon. 

Take a large piece of fresh salmon, scale it, and 
wipe it clean. Then season it with Jamaica pepper, 
black pepper, mace, and cloves, beat fine, and mixed 
with salt, and a little sal prunella : then pour clarified 
butter over it, and bake it^well. When it is done, take 
it out carefully, and lay it on a cloth to drain. As 
soon as it is quite cold, season it again, lay it close in 
your pot, and cover it with clai-ified butter. Or you 
may pot it in this manner : 

Scale and clean a whole salmon, slit it down the 
baqk, dry it vyell, and cut it as neair the shape, of yoi«r 



<pot as you . can. Thau taka t^^ imtm^ m onnGe 
of mace aud doves beaten, half, an oance of white 
pepper, and an ounce of salt. Then take out all the 
bones, cut oflf the tail and the head below the fins. 
Season the scaly side first, and lay that at the bottom 
of the pot; then rub theseq^oning on thtf other side, 
cover it with a dish, and let it stand all night. It must 
be put double, and the scaly sides top and bottom. 
Put some biitter at the bottom and top, and cover the 
pot \tith some stiff coarse paste. If it it a large fish, 
it will require three hours baking; but if a small one, 
two hours will be suflEicient. When it tomes out of 
the oven, let it stand half an hour, then uncover it, 
raise it up at one end that the gravy may ran out, 
and put a trencher and weight on it efieptiially to an- 
swer this purpose. When the butter is cold take it 
out clear fro^ the gravy, add more butter to it, and 
put it in^ a pan before the fiore. When it is melted 
pour it over the salmon, and as soon as if is cold, pa- 
per it up, put it in a dry place, and it will keep a con- 
siderable time. Carp, tench, trout, and several other 
sorts of fish, may be potted in the same manner. 

Lobster. 

Boil a live lobster in salt and water, and stick a 
skewer in the vent to prevent the water getting in. 
As soon as it is cold, take out all the flesh, beat it fine 
in a mortar, and season it with beaten mace, grated 
nutmeg, pepper, and salt. Mis dl together, melt a 
piec^ of butter the size of a walnut, and mix it with 
tlie lobster as you beat it. When it is beat to a paste, 
put it into yom' pot, and press it down as close and 
hard as you can. Then set some butter in a deep broad 
pan before the fire, and when it is all melted, take off 
the scum, at f^e top,, if any, and pour the clear butter 
over the fish as thick as a crown-piece. The whey 
and churn-milk will settle at the bottom of the pan; .

CHAPTER XXIV. ^ 

CURING VAEIOUS KINDB OF MEATS, SOUSINGS^ 4>C. 

CUT off a fine ham from a fet hind qtmrt^ of pork. 
Take twe otmces ef saltpetre, A pound of coarse sugar, 
a pound of common salt, and tv^o ounces 6f sal pru- 
nella; mix all together, and rrib ft well. Let it lie 
a month in this ptckle^ turning and basting it every 
day; then hang it in a wood smoke in a dry place, so 
that no h^it eomes to it; and, if you intend to keep 
them long, hang them a month ot two in a damp place, 
and it will make them cut fine and short. Never lay 
these hams in water till you boil them, and' then boll 
them in a copper, if you have one, or the largest pot 
you have. Put them into the water cold, and let them 
be four or five hours before they boil. Skim the pot 
well, and often, till it boils. If it is a very large one, 
three hours will boil it; if a small one, two hours will 
do, pn)vided it is a great while before the water boils. 
Take it up half an hoar before dinner, pull off the 
skin, and throw raspings, finely sifted, al! over. Hold 
a red-hot salamander over it, and when dinner is rea- 
dy, take a few raspings in a sieve, and sift all over the 
dish, then lay in your ham, and with your finger make 
figures round the edge of yout dish. Be sure to boil 
your ham in a» much watei' as^ you can, and l^eep skim- 
ming it all the time it boib. The pickle you take your 
ham out of wffl do fisiefy for tongues. Let them lay 
in it a fortn^ht, and then lay them in a place where 
there is woefd smoke, to dry. When you broil any 
slices of ham or bacon, haVe some boiling water ready, 
let them lay a minute or two in' it, and then put them 
on a gridiron. This is a Very good method, as it 
takes* out the viol^ce of the salt, and makes^ them 
have -a fine iHrrbun ^ 



Mix wqU togeihw half a peek of salt, Ibvee oonoes 
of saltpetre, half aa ounce of sal jHTUBella, and fi^e 
pounds of very coarse salt. Rub the hams well with 
this :, ptlt them into a large pan or pidding-tub, and lay 
the remainder on the top. Let them lie three days, 
and then hang them up. Put as much water to the 
picld^ as will, cover the hams, adding salt tiU^ it will 
bear an egg, md then boil and strain it^ The tiext 
.mpraiilg. put ih tbQJuams, and press thefii down so that 
they i0i|y be wrewd^ Let &em ky a fortnight, then 
.rol^ a^ffm Yfisil with tean^ and dry them. The quan-^ 
tily of ii^re^^l^its b$re djxeoted, is for doing three 
middle-r6£9e4 h^m^ at onoe^ so that if you do only one, 
joa musj; pr^gH^tiim tbe quantity of each article. 

JVew Et^gland Hams. 
Get l^wofi^e hw^, and in the mode of cure for this 
pvurpose, proceed a^ follows : teke two ounces of sal 
prun^Ua, beat it fine, r^b it well ib, and let (iiem lie 
itweuty-four hoalr^. Then take half a pound of bay- 
^fdt, a\auarter of a pound of wmmon salt^ and one 
ounce of saltpetxeTail beatBne, and half a pound of the 
podj;sest sugar. Rub all these well in, and let theni 
Ite two or tlufee days- Then take some winte com* 
mon salt, and make a pretty strong brine, with about 
two gallons of water and half a pound of brown sc^ar. 
Boil it well, and scuna it when cold ; put in the hams, 
and turn them every two or thr^e days in tbe pickle 
for three weeks. Then hang them up in a chimney, 
and smoke them well a day or two with horse litter. 
Afterwards let them hang about a week <m the side of 
the kitchen (^mn^y, a^d then take them down. Keep 
thei^ dry in a large box, and cover them well with 
bran. T^ey wiU keep good in this state for a year, 
though if wante4, may be u§ed m a mon^h. 

Bacon. 
Take oft all the inside fat of a ^ide of wrk, and lay 
it on a long board ojr di^eiiser, that tjie fcjpod.w* TO*

from it. Rub it well on both sides with good salt, and 
let it lie a day. Then take a pint of bay-salt, a quar* 
iter of a pound of saltpetre, and beat them both fine ; 
. two pounds of coarse sugar^ and a quarter of a peck of 
common salt. Lay your pork in something\hat will 
hold the pickle, and rub it well with the above ingre- 
dients. Lay the skinny side downwards, and baste it 
every day with a pickle foi* a fortnight. Then hang 
it in a wood-smoke, and afterwards in a dry but not 
)iot place. Remember that all-ltamsand bacons should 
hang clear from every thing, and not touch the wall. 
Take care to wipe off the old salt before" yon put it into 
the pickle, and never keep bacon or hams in *a hot 
kitchen, or in a room exposed to the rays of the sun, as 
all these matters will greatly contributef to make them 
rusty. 

Mutton Hams. 

Take a hind quarter of mutton, cut it like a ham, 
aiui rub it well with an ounce of saltpetre, a pound of 
coarse sugar, and a pound of common salt, mixed well 
tf^ether. Lay it in a deepish tray^widi the skin down- 
ward, and baste it with the pickle every day for a fort* 
night. Then roll it in sawdust, and hang it in a wood- 
smoke for a fortnight. Then boil it, and hang it up in 
a dpy plaee. You may dress it whole, or cut slices off, 
and broil them^ which will eat well, and have an ex- 
cellent flavour. 

Beef Hams. 

Cut the leg of a fat Scotch or Welch ox as nearly 
in the shape of a ham as you can. Take an ounce of 
bay-salt, an ounce of saltpetre, a pound of comtnon salt, 
and a pound <Jf coarse sugar, which will be a Sufficient 
quantity for about fourteen or fifteen pounds of beef; 
and if a greater or less quantity of meat, mix your, 
ingredients in proportion. Pound these ingredients, 
mix them well together, rub your meat with it, turn it 
every day, and at the same time baste it well with the 
pickle. Let it lie in this state for a month, then take 
it out, roll it in bran or sawdust, and hang it in a wood-*- 
smoke for a month. Then take it down, hang it in a 



dty place, ^d keep ft for use. You may drew it in 
whatever mauner you please, and as occasion. may re- 
quire. If you boil a piece of it, and let it be till it is 
cold, ityill eat very good, and shives like Dutch beef; 
or it is exceeding fine cut into rashers and broiled, 
with poached eggs laid on the tops. 

Keafs Tongue. 
Scrape your tongue clean, dry it well with a cloth, 
and then salt it with common salt, and half an ounce 
of saltpetre well mixed togi^her. Lay, it in a deep 
pan, and tura it evesry day for a week or ten days. 
Then turn it again, and let it lay a weekionger. Take 
it out of the pan, dry it with a "cloth, strew flour on it, 
and hang it up in a moderate warm place to dry. 

Hung Beef. 
Make a strong brine with bay-salt, saltpetre, and 
pump-water ; put a rib of beef into it, and let it lay 
for nine days. Then hang it up a chimney where 
wood or sawdust is burnt. When it is a little dry, - 
wash the outside with bullock's blood two or three 
times, to make it look black ; and when it is dry enough 
boil it, and serve it u^ with such kind of vegetables as 
you think proper. 

Another method of preparing hung beef is this : take 
the navel-piece, and hang it up in your cellar as long 
as it will keep good, and till it begins to be a little 
sappy; then take it down, cut it into three pieces, and 
wash it in sugar and water, one [riece after another. 
Then take a pound of saltpetre, and two pounds of 
bay-salt, dried and pounded small. Mix with them 
two or three spoonsful of brown sugar, and. rub your 
beef well with it in every place. Then strew a suf-' 
^cient quantity of common salt all over it, and let the 
beef lie close till the salt is dissolved, which will be in 
six or seven days. Then turn it every other day for a 
fortnight, and after that hang it up in a warm but not 
hot place. It may hang a fortnight in the kitchen, 
and when you want it, boil it in bay-salt and pump- 
water till it is tender. It will keep when boiled, twt-

Dutch Beef. ^ 

Take a buttock of beef, cut off all the fat, and rub 
the lean all over with brown sugar. Let it lie two or 
three hours in a pan or tray, and turn it two or 
three times. Then salt it with saltpetre and common 
salt, and let it lay a fortnight, turning it every day. 
After the expiration of this time, roll it very straight 
in a coarse cloth, put it into a cheese^press for a day 
and a night, and then hang it to dry in a chimney. 
When you boil it put it into a doth, and when cold, 
it will cut like Dutch beef. 

Hunting Beef. 
• Take a pound of salt, two ounces of saltpetre, a 
quarter of a^und of brown sugar, one ounce of cori- 
anders, one eunce of cloves, half an ounce of mace, 
half an ounce of nutmeg, two ounces of allspice, a quar*^ 
ter of a pound of pepper, half an ounce of chyan pep 
per, and two ounces of ginger ; let the whole be ground 
and well mixed. Take your buttock <Sf beef and rub 
it well with the spices, and keep turning and rubbing 
it every day, one month : when your beef is to be done, 
take a deep pan, put in your beef with plenty of fat 
over and under, taking care that your beef does not 
touch the l^ttom of the pan. Cover your pan down 
close so that the steam does not come out, which may 
be prevented by putting a paste to the cover made 01 
flour and water. Send it to the oven, and if moderate 
it will be done enough in five hours. It should not be 
taken out of your pan till quite cold; be sure to have, 
plenty of fat, as there must not be any water put in. 

Pickled Porjc. 
Bone your pork, and then cut it into pieces of a 
size suitable to lay in the pan in which you intend to . 
put it Rub your pieces first with saltpetre, and then 
with two poiuds of common salt, and two of bay-salt^ 



mixoliloeetlMr. Put a layar of oomiKm salt at the 
iMnuiiM oi your pan or tab» cover every piece oyer with 
common »ait, and lay them one upon another as even 
as you can, filling the hollow places on the sides with 
salt. Jts your salt melts on the top, strew on more, 
lay a coarse cloth over the vessel, a board over that, 
and a weight on the board to keep it dowfi. Cover it 
close, strew oh more salt as may be occasionally 
necessary, and it will keep good till the very last bit* 

Mock Brawn, 

Take the head, and a piece of (iie belly-part of a 
young jrf>rker, and rub them well with saltpetre. Let 
them lay three dajrs, and then wash them clean, Split 
the head and boil it, take out the bones, and cut it into 
pieces. Then take four cow-heels boiled tender, cut 
them in thin pieces, and lay them in the belly-piece 
of pork, with the head cut small. Then roll it up 
tight with sheet-tin, and boil it four or five hours. 
When it comes out, set it up on one end, put a 
trencher on it within the tin, press it down with a large 
. weight, and let it stand all night. Nfext morning take 
it out of the tin, and bind it with a fillet. Put it into 
cold salt and water, and it will be fit for use. If you 
change the salt and water every four days, it will keep 
for a long tijne. 

Turkey soused in Imitation of Sturgeon. 

Dress a fine large turkey, dry aild bone it, then 
tie it up as you do a sturgeon, and put it into the pot, . 
with a quart of white wine, a quart of water, the same 
quantity of good vinegar, and a large handful of salt; 
but remeriabcr that the wine, water, and vinegar, must 
boil before you put in the turkey, and that the pot 
must be well skimmed before it boils. When ij is 
enough, take it out, and tie it tighter ; but let the 
liquor boU a littje longer. If you think the. pickle , 
wants more- vin^^aj; or salt, add them when it is -

To make fine Sausages. 

Taki six* pounds of young pork, free froih skiti, 
gristles, and &t. Cut it very small, and beat it in a 
mortar tUl it » very fine. Then shred six ponnds of 
beef-siset very fine, and firee from aU skin. Take a 
good deal of si^e, wash it very clean, pick cS Ihe 
leaves, and shred it fine. Spread your meat on a clean 
dresser or table, and then shake the sage all over it, 
to the quantity of about three large spoonsful. Shred 
the thin rind of a middling lemon vety fine, and throw 
them over the meat, and also as many sweet herbs as, 
when shred fine, will fill a large spoon. Grate over it 
two nutmegs, and put to it two tea-spoonsful of pep- 
per, and a large spoonful of salt. Then throw over it 
the suet, and mix all well together. Put it down close 
in a pot, and when you use it, roll it up with as much 
egg as will tnake it roll ^nooth. Make them of the 
size of a sausage, and fry them in butter, or good drip* 
ping. Be careful the butter is hot before you put them 
in, and keep rolling them about while they are doii^. 
When they- are thoroughly hot, and of a fiaie light 
brown, take tliem out, put them into a dish, and serve 
them up. Veal mixed with pork, and done in this maiw 
ner, eats exceeding fine. 

Oxford Sausages. 

Take a pound of young pork, fat and lean, with- 
out skin or gristle, a pound of lean veal, and a pound 
of beef-suet, chopped all fine together; put in half a 
pound of grated bread, half the peel of a lemon shred - 
fine, a nutmeg grated, six sage-leaves washed and 
chopped very fine, a tea-spoonful of pepper and two 
of sajt, some thyme, savory, and marjorum, shred fine. 
Mix 331 well together, and put it close down in a ]Mui

To keep Green Peas till Christmaa. 

PEAS for tlw purpose mn^t b^ chiMejn very fine, 
youQg and fresh gathered. SheU Hiiwi^ atid-pat 
them into boilii^ water with some salt in it. Wh^ft 
they have bpiled five or six mtnate^ throw them itato 
a cullender to drwi. Th^i lay a eloth fom or fivfe 
times doable on a table, and spread tliem on it. Dry 
them welly and having your bottles ready, fill them 
and cover them with mutton-fal; firied. Cork them as 
close-as possible, tie a bladder over, them, and set 
them in a cool place. When you use them, boil the 
water, put in a little salt, some sugar, and a piece of^ 
butter. As soon as they are enough, throw them into 
a sieve to drain; then put them into a saucepan with 
a^good piece of butter, keep shaking it round till the . 
butter is aU melted, tiien turn them into a dish, and 
send them to table. 

To keep Gooseberries. 

Put an ounce of roche-alum, beat very fine, into a 
large pan of boiling hard water. When you have 
picked your gooseberries, put a few of them into the 
bottom of a hair sieve, and hold them in the boiling 
water till they turn white. Then take out the sieve, 
and spread the gooseberries between two ciesm cloths. 
Put more gooseberries in your sieve, and then repeat 
it till they are done. Put the water into a glazed pot 
till next day; then put your gooseberries into wide« 
mouthed bottles, {Hck out all the cracked and l»oken 
ones, pour the water clear out of the pot» and fill yoor 
bottles with it Then cork them looBdy, and let them 
stand a fortnight. If they rise to the corks, draw them 
out, and let them stand two or three drjns uncorked. > 
Then cork them quite close> and they wiU keep |;o<id 
several months. 

Another method of keeping gooseberries is this : 
Pjck them as large $nd dry as you can, and hstving

taken care that your bottles are dean and dry, fill asid 
cork them. Set them in a kettle of water up to the 
neck, and let the water boil veiy riowljr tiH jon &id 
the gooseberries are coddled ; then take them out, and 
put in the rest of the bottles till all are done. Have 
ready some rosin melted in a pipkin, and dip the necks 
of the bottles into it, which will prevent all air fiom 
getting in at the coik. Keep them in a cool dry place, 
»nd when you use them they will bake as red as a 
dierry, and have their natural flavour. 

To keep Mushrooms. 
Take large buttous, wash them in the same man- 
ner as for stewiiig, and lay them on sieves with the 
stalks upwards. ' Throw over them some salt, to draw 
out the water. When they are properly drained, put 
them into a pot, and set them in a cool ovei^ for an 
hour. Then take them out carefully, and lay them to 
cool and drain. Boil the liquor that comes out of them 
with a blade or two of mace, and boil it half away. 
Put your mushrooms into a clean jar well dried, and 
when the liquor is cold, pour it into the jar, and cover 
your mushrooms with it. Then pour over them ren- 
dered suet; tie a bladder over the jar, and set them 
in a dry closet, where they will keep very well the 
greater part of the winter. When you use them, take 
them out of the h'quor, pour over them boiling milk, 
and let them stand an hour. Then stew them in the 
milk a quarter of an hour, thicken them with flour, and ' 
a large quantity of butter ; but be careful you dp not 
oil it. Then beat the yolks of two eggs in a little 
cream, and put it into the stew ; but do not let it boil 
after you have put in the eggs. Lay unroasted sippets 
round the inside of the dish, then serve them up, and ] 
they will eat nearly as good as when fresh gathered. 
If they do not taste strong enough, put in a little of 
the liqnor. This is a very useful liquor, as it will give 
a sbrong flavour of fresh mushrooms to all made dishes. 

To BptUe Damsons. 
Take your damsons before they sure too ripe» put 



tlMDi iiit0 wide-mooihed bottles, and optk tiiein dowa 
tight ; then pot them into a moderate 6ven, and about 
three hours will do them. You must be careful your 
oven is not too hot, or it will make your fruit fly» All 
kinds t)f fruits that are bottled may be done in the same 
way, and if well done will keep two years. Ailer they 
are done they must be put away, with the mouth down- 
ward^ in a cool ^ace, to keep them from fermenting. 

*^* Rememberf^that every species of the vegetaUo 
tribe designed for future use, at times out of the natural 
season, must be kept in dry places, as damps will not 
only cover them with mould, but will also deprive them 
of their fine flavour. It must likewise be observed, 
that while you endeavour to avoid putting them into 
damp places, you do not place them where they may 
get warm, which will be equally detrimental ; so that a 
proper attention must be paid to the observance of a ju- 
dicious medium. When you boil any dried vegetables, 
always allow them plenty of water. 

CHAPTER IXVL 

POSSETS, GRUELS, ^e. 

Sa(^ P&ssets. 

BEAT up the yolks and whites of fifteen eggs, and 
then strain them ; then put three quarters of a pound 
of white sugar into a pint of canary^ and mix it with 
your eggs in a basin ; set it over a chafing-dish of 
coals, and keep continually stirring it till it is scalding 
hot. In the mean time grate some nutmeg in a quart 
of milk, and boil it, and then pour it into your eggs, 
and tvine while they are scalding hot. As you pour it 
hold your hand very high, and let another person keep 
stirring it all the time. Then take it oflf, set it before 
the fire half an hour, and serve it up. 

Another method of making sack-posset is this : take 
four Naples biscuits, and crumble them into a quart of 
new milk when it boils. Just ^ve it a boU, take it 
offf tp^ivte in Mxnne nutmegs^ and sweeten it to jmac 



312 ' FOSSE ri, ^c. 

palate. * Then pour in half a pint of sack, keep stir- 
ring it all the time, put it into your basin, and send it 
to table. 

Wine Posset. 

BorL the crumb of a penny loaf in a quart of millc 
till it is soft, then take it off" the fire, and grate in half 
a nutmeg. Put in sugar to your taste, then pour it 
into a china bowl, and put in by degrees a pint of 
Lisbon wine. Serve it up with toasted bread upon a 
plate. 

Ale Posset. 

Take a small piece of white bread, put it into a 
pint of milk, and set it over the fire. Then put some 
nutmeg and sugar^ into a pint of ale, warm it, and 
when your milk l)oils, pour it upon the ale. Let it 
i^and a few minutes to clear, and it will be fit for user. 

Orange Posset. 
Take the crumb of a penny loaf grated fine, and 
put it into a pint of water, with half the peel of a 
Seville orange grated, or sugar rubbed upon it to take 
out the essence. Boil all together till it looks thick and 
clear. Then take a pint of mountain wine, the juice 
of half a Seville orange, three ounces of sweet s^lmonds, 
and one of bitter, beat fine, with a little French bran- 
dy, and sugar to your taste. Mix all well together, 
put it into your posset, and serve it up. Lemon pos- 
set must be made in the same manner. 

White Caudle. 

Take two quarts of water, and mix it w^ith four 
spoonsful of oatmeal, a blade or two of mace, and a 
piece of lemon-peel. Let it boil, and keep stirring it 
often. Let it boil a quarter of an hour, and be care- 
ful not to let it boil over, then strain it through a coarse 
sieve. When you use it sweeten it to your taste, grate 
in a little nutmeg, and w^hat wine you think proper; 
and if it is not for a sicjt person, squeeze in the juice 
of a lemon. 

Brown Caudle, 

Mix your gruel as for the white caudle, and when 



you have strained it, add a quart of ale that is not 
bitter. Boil it, then sweeten it to your palate, and 
add half a pint of white wine or brandy. When you 
do not put in white wine or brandy, let it be half ale. 

White Wine Whey. 

Put in a large basin half a pint of skimmed milk 
and half a pint of wine. When it has stood a few mi- 
nutes, pour in a pint of boiling water. Let it stand a 
little, and the curd will gather in a lump, and settle at 
the bottom. Then pour your whey into a china bowl, 
and put in a lump of sugar, a sprig of balm, or a shce 
of lemon. 

Water Gruel. 

Put a large spoonful of oatmeal into a pint of water, 
and stir it well together, and let it boil three or -four 
times, stirring it often ; but be careful it does not boil 
over. Then strain it through a sieve, salt it to your 
"palate, and put in a good piece of butter. Stir it about 
with a spoon till the butter is all melted, and it will be 
fine and smooth. 

Barley Gh^ueL' 

Put a quarter of a pound of pearl-barley, and a 
stick of cinnamon, into two quarts of water, and let 
it boil till it is reduced to one quart. Theu strain it 
through a sieve, add a pint of red wine, and sweeten 
it to your taste. . 

Orgeat Paste. 

Take three quarters of a pound of sweet almonds, 
and a quarter of a pound of bitter almonds^ blanch and 
pound them in your mortar, wetting them from time 
to time with orange-flower water that they may not oil. 
When they are pounded very fine, add three quarters 
of a pound of fine pounded sugar to it, and mix the 
whole into a stiff paste, and then put it into your pots 
for use. This paste will keep six months. When yon 
wish to use it, you may take a piece about the size of 
an egg and mix it with half a pint of water, and squeeze 
it through a fine napkin.

CHAPTER XXVIJ, 

MADE WINES, 4-c. 

A STRICT and attentive management in the making 
of these articles is the grand means by which they are 
to be brought to a proper ^;ate of perfection ; and with- 
out which, labour, expense, and disrepute, will be 
the final, and disagreeable consequences. To prevent 
the last, and promote the first, let a due pbsfsryapqe be 
paid to the tollowing general rules : do vol let such 
wine3 as re(|uire to be. made witli boiling watar stand 
too long after drawn, before you get them cold*, ^d he 
careful to put in your barm in due time, otherwise it 
will fret after being put into the cask, and can never 
be brought to that gtate of fineness it ought tp be. 
Neither must you let it work too long in tw huttf as 
It will be apt to take off the sweetness and flavour of 
the fruit or flowers from w hich it is n^ade. Let your 
vessels be thoroughly clean and drv, and before you 
put in the wine, give them a rince with a little brandy. 
When the wine has done fermenting, bung it up close, 
and after being properly settled, it will draw to your 
wishes. 

Raisin Wine. 

Put two hundred wei^t oJF raisins, with, all their 
stalks into a large hogshead, and fill it up with water. 
Let them steep a fortnight, stirring them every day. 
Then pour off the liqjior, and press the raisins. Pot 
both liquors together into a nice cleaa vessd that will 
|ust hold it, &>€ remember, it must be qpite full. Let 
it stand till it is done hissing, or making the least noise, 
then stop it close, and let it stand six. months. Then 
peg it, and if quite clear, rack it off into another ves- 
sel. Stop it again close, and let it stand three months 
longer. Then bottle it, and when wanted, rack ii off 
into a decanter. 

JtB excelUnt Wine from Smyrna Currants. 
To evgry {(aUon of vrater pat two pounds and Hcrt^ 
quarters of brown sugar, and one pound and a faatfof 



^mj^n oornuito. Boil the 8»gar and water for half

taken off by the heat of the sun. Spread them loose 
on a cloth, or a clean floor, and let them lay twenty- 
four hours. Then put them into a convenient vessel 
for the purpose, squeeze out all the juice, and drain it 
from the seeds. Boil up a gallon of water to eich 
gallon of juice you get out of them ; then skim the 
water well^ and add a little cinnamon slightly bruised. 
Put to each gallon six ounces of white sugar-candy 
finely beaten. Skim and strain the water, when it has 
been tak^d off, and is settled; and put to it some 
more juice of the mulberries. To e^ery galloa of the

Orange Wine. 
Boil six gallons of spring water three quarters of 
an hour, with twelve pounds of the best powder sugar, 
and the whites of eight or ten eggs well beaten. When 
it is cold, put it in six spoonsful of yea«t. Take the juice 
of twelve lemons, which, being pared, must stand 
with about two pounds of white sugar in a tankard, 
and in the morning skim off the top, and put it in the 
water. Then add the juice and rinds of fifty oranges, 
but not the white parts of the rinds, and then let them 
work all together for forty-eight hours, Then add two 
quarts of Rhenish or white wine, and put it into your

Orange wine may be made with raisins, in which 
case proceed thus : take thirty pounds of new Malaga 
raisins picked clean, chop them small, and take twenty 
large Seville oranges, ten of which you must prepare 
as thin as for preserving. Boil about eight gallons of 
soft water till one third of it is wasted, and let it cool 
a little. Then put five gallons of it hot upon your 
raisins and orange-peel, stir it well together, cover it 
up, and when it is cold, let it stand five days, stirring 
it once or twice a day. Then pass it through a hair 
sieve, and with a spoon press it as dry as you can 
Put it in a rundlet fit for use, and put to it the rinds 
of the other ten oranges, cut as thin as the first. Then 
make a syrup of the juice of twenty oranges, with a^ 
pound of white sugar, which nmst be done the day 
before you tun the wine. Stir it well- together, and 
stop it close. Let it stand two months to clear, and 
then bottle it off. This wine greatly improves by time, 
and will drink much better at the end of the third year 
than the first.

of single-refined sugar, and when the peels are ready, 
boil fifteen gallons of water with forty pounds of single- 
refined sugar for half an hour. Then put it into a tub, 
and when cool, add to it one spoonful of barm, and let 
it work two days. Then turn it, and put in the l»ran-

CHAPTER IXVIIL 
CORDIAL WATERS. 

IN the process of naaking these articles, several 
things are necessary to be observed, in order to bring 
them to their proper state of perfection. If your still • 
is an alembic, you must fill the top with coW water 
when you set it ori> and close the bottom with a little 
stiff paste made of flour and jvater. If you use a hot 
still, when you put on the top, dip a cloth in white 
lead and oil, and lay it close over the ends, and a coarse 
cloth well soaked in water on the top; and w^hen it 
becomes dry from the heat of the fire, wet it and lay it 
on again. It will require but little fire, but w^hat there 
is must be as clear as possible.- All simple waters 
must stand two or three days before they are bottled 
off, that the fiery taste which they will natufally receive 
from the still may be fiilly extracted. 

Rose Water. 
Gather your roses when they are .dry and fii!l 
blown^ pick off the leaves^ and to ey^y peck fviLm % 



CORDIAL WATERS. 325 

qmH of water. Then put them into a cold still, and 
make a dow*ftre tinder it; for the more gradually it is 
distilled^ the better it will be. Then bottle it, and in 
two or three days you may cork it up for use. 

XiCimnder Water. 

To e^ery p(Hind of lavender^neps put a quart of 
watbr* Put them ii^ a cold still, and nrake a slow 
fire under it. Distil it off very slowly, and put it into 
a pot. till you have distiQed all your water. Then 
elean your still well out, put your lavender-water into 
it, and distil it off as slowly as before. Then put it 
into bottles, cork them quite close, and set them by for 
use. 

Peppermint Water. 

Oath BR your peppermint when it is full grown,, 
and biefore it seeds. Cut it into short lengths, put it 
into your still, atid cover it with water. Make a good 
fire under it, and when it is near boiling, and the still 
begins to drop, if you find your fire too hot, draw a 
little away, that the liquor may not boil over. The 
slower your still drops, the clearer and stronger will be 
the water; but at the same time you must not let it 
get too weak. The next morning bottle it off, and 
after it has stood two or three days, to take off* the . 
fiery taste of the still, cork it well, and it will preserve 
its strength a considerable time. 

Surfeit Water. 
Take scurvy-grass, brook-lime, water^cresses, Ro- 
man wormwood, rue, mint, balm, sage, and chives, of 
each one handful; poppies, if jTresh, half a peck;, but 
if they are dryi only half that quantity ; cochineal an<i; ) 
sai&ron, six-pennyworth of each : aniseeds, carraway- ;[ 
seeds, coriander-seeds, and cardamum seeds, df.each.r 
an ounce; two ounces of scraped liquorice, a^poun^^i 
of split figs, the same quantity of raisins of the sun

CHAPTEB XM3L . 
rffJB ^fUr OF BREWIJ^TG. 

TO complete the Houaekeep^'a kn^v^Icd^^. m bB 
domestic concerns, it is essentially necessary she ahoidd 
be properly acquainted with the meth9d of biewifig 
malt-liquors, more e^^pecially should ^ be the ]vinei* 
pal provider for a numerous family. This badness 
will therefore form the subject of the present diapteor. 
and the mode to be pursued throughout the whole pro- 
cess we shall endeavour to lay down in sa clear, con- 
cise, and inteUigent a manner, as may easily guide the. 
unacquainted, and perhaps, in aonote degree, be mate- 
rially bei^efiicial^ to those already infqiniied. 

SECT. L 

Th^ Prmjt^les cm which a Capper should be buQt 
far Sremng. 

THisRE are several things that deiaiaad pecidMur no* 
tice previous to the actud process of brewteg malt 
liquors; and those are with respect to the vawms im- 
plements necessary to e&ct and facilitate a proper 
execution of so important a business^. 

The first thing that presents itself among these is 
the copper, the proper poaition of which, and manner 
of its belpn^ spt^ af e m^^^^xsi tl)j|t i^nlwe rery attentii»0 



^M^demtion. The most beneflciAl mode to lie' adopt- 
ed is this : divide the heat of 4he fire by a stop ; and if 
the. door and draught be in a direct line, the stop must 
be erected fix>m the middle of each outline of the grat- 
ing, and parallel with the centre sides of the copper; 
by whidi method the middle of the fire will be direct- 
ly under the bottom of the copper. The «top is com- 
po^d of a thin wall in the centre of the r%ht and left 
sides of the copper, which is to ascend half the height 
of it On the top must be left a cavity, from four to si^^ 
inches, for a draught for that half part of the fire which 
is next the door of the copper; and then the building 
must close aJl round to the finishing at the top. By 
this method the heat will communicate from the out- 
ward part of the fire round the outward half of your 
copper, through the cavity, as well the farthest part of 
the -flue, which ateo contracts a conjunction of the 
whole, and causes the flame to glide gently and equally 
round the bottom of the copper. 

The advantages deri fed from your copper being set 
in this manner are very great, nor is the saving of fuel 
the least object of consideration among them . It has a 
material pre-eminence over wheel-draughts ; for w ith 
them, if tt^re is not particular attendance given to the 
hops> by stirring them down, they are apt to stick to 
the sides, and scordi, which will deprive the liquor of 
having its sweet and proper flavcair. By the before 
mentioned method the copper will last many years 
more than it will by the wheel-draught ; for that draws 
with so much violence, that should your liquor be 
beneath the communication of the fire, your copper 
will thereby be liable to injury; whereas by the other 
method, you may boil half a copper ftrH without fear 
uf any bad consequence.

Buike district examination into all your vemdSf t&at 
they are thoroughly clean, and in a proper state for use. 
They should never be converted to any other purpose, 
except for the use of making wines ; and, even in that 
case, after done with, should be properly cleansed, and 
kept in a place free from dirt. Let your cask be weU 
cleaned with boiling water; and if the bang-hole is 
large enough, scrub them well with a small birch- 
broom, or brash. If you find them bad, and a vpry 
musty scent comes firom them, take out the heads, and 
let them be scrubbed clean with a hand brush, sand, 
and fullers'-^earth. When you have done this, put om 
the head again, and scald it well, then throw in a piece 
of unslacked lime, and stop the bung dose. When 
they have stood some time, rince them well with cold 
water, and they wiQ be properly prepared for use. . 

The greatest attention must likewise be paid to the 
care of your coolers, which are implements of very ma- 
terial consequence ; for, if they are not properly kept 
in order, your Uquor, from a secret and unaccountabk 
cause, abstracts a nauseousness that will entirely de- 
stroy it. X This often proceeds from wet liaving been 
infused in the wood, as it is sometimes apt to lodge ia 
the crevices of old coolers, and even infect them to such 
a degree, that it will not depart, though many washings 
and scaldings are applied. One cause incidental to 
this evil is, suffering women to wash in a brewhouse, 
which ought by no means to be permitted^ where any 
other convenience can be had ; for nothing can be more 
hurtful than the remnants of dirty soap suds left in- 
vessels calculated only for the purpose of brewing. 

When you prepare the coolers, be careful never to 
let the water 9tand too long in them, as it will soak in, 
and soon turn putrid, when the stench will ei^ter the . 
wood, and render them almost incurable. To prevent 
such consequences, as well as to answer good purposes, 
it has been recommended, where fixed brewhouses 
are intended, that all coolers should be leaded. It 
must be admitted, in the first placi^, that such are ex- 
ceeding cleanly ; and. secondly, that it expedites the 



^soolii^ paft of your liquor worte, which is very neces 
»ary to forward it for WOTking, as well as afterwards 
for cooling the ^vhole ; for eyaporation causes consi- 
derably more waste than proper boiling. It is also 
indispensably necessary that your coolers be well scour- 
ed with cold water two or three times, cold water 
being more proper than hot to effect a perfect cleansing, 
especiuUy if they are in a bad condition, from undis- 
covered filth that may be in the crevices. The appli- 
cation of warm water will drive the infection farther; 
so that if your liquor be let into the coolers, and any 
reniain in the crevices, the heat will collect the foulness, 
and render the whole 4)oth disagreeable and unwhole- 
some. 

The mash-tub in particular must be kept perfectly 
clean; nor must the grains be left in the tub any long- 
er than the day after brewing, lest it should sour the 
tub ; for if there is a sour scent in the brewhouse before 
yoor beer is tunned, it will be apt to infect your liquor 
and worts. From such iiMxmveniences, the necessity 
of cleanliness in ut^isils for brewing is sufficiently 
Obvious.

Directions for the Management of the Ma^h-tuA^, 
Penstaff, <$«c- 

To render yoii^ mash-tub more periectrand lasting, 
you should have a circular piece of brass or copper, to 
inlay and line the whole where the penstaff enters, to 
let the wort run off into the uaderback. ^Fhe penstaff 
should be also strongly ferrelled with the same metal, 
and both well andtaperly finished, so that you can place 
it properly. By this method you have it ran from 
the fineness of a thread to the fulness of an inch tube, 
&;c. first dressing your musk-basket with straw, fern, 
or small bushy furze without stems, six or eight inches 
in from the bottom of your basket, and set quite per- 
pendicularly over the whole^ with the penstaff through 

No. 14. 2 T 



the centre (£ the ba^t/and the middle of (he fk»e 
or iorn, and fastened to the hole of the tab. To steady 
it properly, you must have a piece of iron let into a 
staple fastened to the tub, at the nearest part (^posite 
the baiket, and to reach nearly to it; and bom thai 
piece another added mi a jointed swivel, or any o^er 
contrivance, so as to be at liberty to let round the ba^ 
ket lilce a dog's collar, and to enter into the staple form* 
ed in the same to pin it fast^ and by adding {i half eir* 
cular turn into the collar, in which you have room to 
drive in a wedge, which will beep it safe down to the 
bottom, where there can be no dsuiger rf its being dis- 
turbed by stirring the mash, which will otherwise 
sometimes be the case. When you let go, you will 
raise the penstaff to your own degree of running, and 
then fasten the staff, by the help of two wedges tight- 
ened between the staff and the basket 

In process of time the ciq[>per work, like everything 
else, will become defective, and when this is the case,, 
you may repair the imp^feetion hy Ihe following sim- 
ple method. Work the penstaff in the brttss socket 
with emery and water, or oil, which will make it per- 
haps more perfect than wb^» new. The like method 
is sometimes taken even with taps just purchased, in 
order to prevent their decaying so soon as they other- 
wise would, 

A very mat^at addition may be made to the con- 
venience of the underbacks, by having a piece of cop- 
per to line the hole in the bottom, which may be s^top- 
ped with a cloth put* singly round a large tap; and 
when it is fastened down far the wort to run, it will be 
necessary to put a large weight on the tap, which will 
prevent its flying up by the heat. When the liquor 
is pumped el^m out of the back, the cloth round the 
tap will enable you to take out tlie tap with ease ; and 
there should be a drain below the onderback to carry 
off the water, whidi will enable you to wash it perfect- 
ly clean with very little trouble. This drain should 
be made with a de^v descent, so as no damp may re- 
main voider the back. With the conveyance of watei 



BREWLKO^ 33] 

moniiig into your copper, you may be enabled to work, 
that water in a double quantity, your underback being 
filled, by thp meaiia of letting it in at ydur leimu-e, out 
of yonr copper, through a shoot to the mash-tub, and 
80 to the underbade. Thus you will haVe a reserve 
against the tune you wish to fill your copper, which 
may be onapleted in a few minutes, by pumping while 
the undar tap is running. Thus much for the princi- 
piail utenstils in breWiag, which we again recommend 
to he always kept in a perfect state of cleanliness. 



SECT. IV 

Of the proper Time of Brewing. 

The month of March is generally consid^ed as one 
of the principal seasons for brewing malt liquor for 
long keeping; and the reason is, because the air at 
that time of the year is, in general, temperate, and eon- 
tributes to the good working or farmesitation of the 
liquor, which prindpally promotes its jn^eserration and 
good keepkig. Very cold, as well as very hot weather, 
prevents the firee fermentation or working of liquors; . 
so that^ if you brew in very cold weather, unless .you 
use some means to warm tha cellar while new drink 
is working, it will never clear itself in the manner you^ 
would wish, and the same i&isfortune will arise if, in 
very hot weather, the cellar is not put into a tempe- 
rate state; the oonsequ^ice of /all which will be, that 
such drink wilj be muddy and sour, and, perhaps, in 
such a^ degree, as to be past recovery. Sudi accidents 
often happen, even in flie poroper season for l^ewing, 
a^d that owing to the badn^s of the cellar; for wh^i 
they are dug in springy groimds, or sure subject to damps|^ 
in the winter, the liquor will chill, and become vapi^^' 
or flat, W)^n cellars are of this nature, it is advisaUe« 
to make your brewings in March, rather than in Octo- 
ber ; for you may keep your cellars temperate in sum- 
mer, but cannot warm them in winter. Thus yoijpr 

b^er bjrewod m March will have due tim^ to settle and

On the Q^ualityi of Water progerfor Brewing. 

It has eridetttly aj^at^ from repeated eKperienee>

which naturally aiisefrom the air and saifi; fer 4hi»

On tte contrary, hard waters astringe and bind the 
power of the malt, sio that ks vilrtne is hot freely eom-

it as a maxim, that all water Hiat wiB mix with tsoa^ 
is fit iot brewing, which is the case with most river^ 
water; and itl^s be^ frequently expmenced, that

It is Iftewise to be observed, that the malt was not- 
only the same int quantity for one barrel as for tiie

measured from the same heap. The hops were also 
the same, both in quality and quantity, and the tiMe 
of boiling equal in each. They were wmrked m the

TMs IB the moist demoiisrf;rabIe and m^eniaUe proof 
. that the difference took place from the difference of 
the quality erf* the water. 

Various experiments hkve been tried by gentlemen 
in different counties to ascertain the troth of this very 
essential difference in malt liquors, arising from the . 
quality of the water ; but after all, they have been 
left in a state of perplexity. 

One circumstance has greatly puzzled the ablest 
Iweweifs, and that is, when several gentlemen in the ^ 
same town have employed the same brewer, have had 
the same malt, the same hops, and the same water, 
and brewed in the same months and broached their 
drink at the same time, yet one has had beer exceed- 
ing fine, strong, and well-tasted, while the others 
have had hardly any worth drinking. In order to ac- 
count for this very singular difference, three reasons 
may be advanced* First, it might arise from the dif- 
ference of the weather, wliioh might happen at the 
several brewings in this month, and make an alteration 
in the WOTking of the hqnors. Secondly, the yeast, 
OT barm, mi^t be of different sorts, or in different 
states, wherewith these liquors were worked ; and, 
thirdly, the cellars might not be equally adapted for 
the purpose; The goodnei^ of such drink as is brew- 
ed for keeping, in a great measure depends on the 
proper form and temperature of the cellars in which 
it is placed. - 

Beer" mader at Dordiester, which in general is 
greatly admired, is, for the most part, brewed With 
chalky *water, which is to be had in most parts of that 
connty; and as the soif is generally chalk, the cellars 
being dug in that dry soil, cowtribute to the good 
keeping of their dririk, it being of a close texture, 
and of a drying quality, so as to dissipate damps; for .' 
it has been found by experience that damp cellars are 
injoriow to the kiieping of Uquor, a3 ivell as injurious 
to the caslf^. ^ 

Water that is miumlly of a hard quality may be,

ran, and puttii^ into it some piebes of soft chalk to 
infuse ; or, when the water is set on to boil, in order 
to he poured on the malt, put into it a quantity of 
bran, which will take off some part of its sharpness, 
and make it better extract the virtnes of the malt. 



SECT. VI. 

Of the Quality of the Malt and Hops most proper 
to be chosen for Bretvingy with some necessary 
Observations on the Management of each. 

There are two sorts of malt, the general distinc- 
tion between which is, that the one is high, and the 
other low dried. The former of these, when brewed, 
produces a liquor of a deep brown colour; and the 
other, which is the low dried, will produce a liquor of 
a pale colour. The first is dried in such a manner as 
rather to be scorched than dried, and is much less 
wholesome than the pale malt. It lias likfewise been 
found by experience, that brown malt, although it 
may be well brewed, will sooner turn sharp than the 
pale; from whence, among other ~ reasons, the latter is 
entitled to pre-eminence. 

We have farther proofe of this distinction from 
various people, bat particularly one : — A gentleman, 
who has made the Art of Brewing his study for many 
years, and who gives his opinion and knowledge in 
words ta this purpose, says, brown malt make^ the 
best drink when it is brewed with a course lAvex water, 
such as that of the Thames about London ; and that 
likewise being brewed with such water makes very 
good ale ; but that it will not keep above six months 
without turning stale, even though he allows fourteen 
bu^els to the hogshead. He adds, that he has tried 
the high-dried malt to brew beer with for keeping and 
hopped it accordingly; and yet he could never*breW it 
so as to drink soft and mellow like that brewed with' 
pale malt". There is, he says, an steid quality in the 
high-dried malt, which occasions those who ddhk it to 



6ii«wiNQ. 335 

be greatly troubled with that disorder called the heart- 
bum. 

What we have here said with respect to malt, rders 
only to that made of barley ; for wheat-malt, pea-malt, 
or high coloured Uquor, will keep some year$, and 
drink soft and smooth, but they are very subject to 
have the ilavour of muni. ^ 

Malt high dried should not be used in brewing till 
it has been ground ten days or a fortnight, as it will 
then yield much stronger drink than from the same 
quantity ground but a short time before it is used. 
On the contrary, pale malt, which has not received 
much of the fire, must not remain ground above a 
week before it is used. 

With respect to hops, the newest are by far the best. 
They will, indeed, remain very good for two years, 
but after that they begin to decay, and lose their fla- 
vour, unless great quantities are kept ti^ether, in 
which case they will keep good much loag^ than in 
small quantities. In order th^ better to preserve them, 
they should be kept in a very dry pla^ce^ contrary to 
the practice of those who de^ in them, who making 
self-interest their first consideration, keep them as 
damp as they can to increase their weight. 

It will hs^ppen, in the course of time, that hops will 
grow stale, decayed, and lose their natural bitterness ; 
but this defect may be removed, by unbagging them, 
and sprinkUng them with aloes and water. . 

From what has been said, it is evident that every 
one of the particulars mentioned should be judiciously 
• chosen before you commence brewing, otherwise you 
will sustain a loss, whidh will be aggravated by your 
labpurs being in vain. It is likewise to be observed, 
th^t the yeast or barm with which you work, your 
liquor, must be well considered, for otherwise, even by 
that alone, a good brewing may be totally desb'oyed. 
lie always particularly careful that you are provided 
\vith every necessary article previous to your com- 
mencing the business of brewing ; for if the wort waits 
for any thing that should be immediately at hand, it 
will be attended with very bad consequences. 



336 BKEWIMO. 

SECT. TIL 

The Process, or Practical Part of Brewing. 

Having, in the preceding sections, fully explained 
the necessary precautions to be taken previous to the 
commencement of this very important business, we 
shall now proceed to give a concise detail of every 
thing that is necessary to be observed and attended to 
in the regular process of it, from the malt being first 
malted, to the liquor being turned off for the cellar. 

Your utensils being all properly cleansed and scald- 
ed, your malt ground, your water in the copper boil- 
ing, and your penstaff well set, you must then proceed 
to mash, by putting a sufficient quantity of boiling wa- 
ter into your tub, in which it must stand until the 
greater part of the steam is gone off, or till you can 
see your own shadow in it. It will be then necessary 
that one person should pour the malt gently in, while 
another is carefully stirring it; for it is equally essential 
that the same care should be observed when the mash 
is thin as when thick. Tliis being effectually done, 
and having a sufficient reserve of malt to cover the 
mash, to prevent evaporation, you 'may cover yom* tub 
with sacks, &c. and leave your malt three hours to 
steep, which will be a proper time for the extraction 
of its virtues. v 

Before you let the mash run, be careful to be pre- 
pared with a pail to catch the first flush, as that is 
generally thickish, and another pail to be ap^hed while 
you return the first on the mash, and so on for two or 
three times, or, at least, till it' runs fine. 

By this time, your copper should be boiling, and a 
convenient tub placed close to your mash-tub. Let 
into it through your spout half the quantity of boiling 
water you mean to use for drawing off your best wort ; 
afler which you must instantly turn the tap to fiU up 
again, which, with a proper attention to the fire, will 
boil in due time. During such time, you must slop 
the mash with this hot water out of the convenient 
tub, in moderate quantities, ^very eiglit or ten minutes 



BREWING. 331 

till the whole is consumed ; and then let off the re- 
maining quantity, which will be boiling hot, to the 
linishing process for strong bfeer. 

Having proceeded thus far, fill your copper, and let 
it boil as quick as possible for the second mash, whe- 
ther you intend it either for ale or small beer. Being 
thus far prepared, let off the remaining quantity of 
wat«r into your tub, as you did for the strong beer ; 
but if you would have small beer besides, you must 
act accordingly, by boiUng a proper quantity off in due 
time, and letting it into the tub as before. 

With respect to the quantity of malt, twenty-four 
bushels will make two hogsheads of as good strong beer 
hs any person would wish to drink, as also two hogs- 
heads of very decent ale. The strong beer made fi-om 
this quantity of malt should be kept two or three 
years before it is tapped, and the ale never less than 
one. If yout mash is only for one hogshead, it should 
be, two hours in running off; if for two hogsheads, two 
hours and a half; and for any greater quantity, three 
hours. 

Particular attention must be paid to the time of 
steeping your mashes. Strong beer must be allowed 
three hours; ale, one hour; and, if you draw small 
beer after, half an hour. By this mode of proceeding, 
your boilings will regularly take place of each other, 
which will greatly expedite the business. Be careful, 
in the course of masking, that it is thoroughly stuTed 
from the bottom, and especially round the muck-basket, 
^ for, being well shaken, it will prevent a stagnation of 
the whole body of the mash. This last process de-' 
mands peculiar attention, for without it youp beer will 
certainly be foxed, and, at best, will have a very dis- 
agreeable flavour. 

In the preparation for boiling, the greatest care must 
be taken to put the hops in with the first wprt, or it 
will char in a few minutes. As soon as the copper is 
full enough, make a good fire under it; but be careful 
in filling it to leave room enough for boiling. Quick 
boUing is part of the business that requires very par

•ticiilM' attention. Great caution shotfld likewise be 
observed when the liqnor begins to swell in waves in 
the copper. If yon have no attendant,, be particular 
attentive to its motions ; and bemg provided with an 
iron rod of a proper len^h^ crooked at one end, and 
jagged at the other, then with the crook you are ena- 
bled to open the furnace, or copper-door, and with 
the other end push in the damper without stinring fix>m 
your station; but on the approach of the first ^well 
you will have sufficient time to proportion your fire, as 
care should be taken that it is not too fierce. When 
the boil is properly got under, you naay increase the 
fire so that it may boil bri^ly. 

In order to ascertain the proper time the Ikpjtot 
should boil, you may. make use of the fi)Uowiflg ex^ 
pedient : take a clean copper bowl didi, dip out some 
of the liquor, and when you discover a working, and 
the hops sinking, then conclude it to be sufficiently 
boiled. Long and slow boiling isnotonly peroieioHs, 
but it likewise wastes the liquor; for the slower it boils 
the lower it drops and singes to your copper; whereas, 
quick boiling has a contrary effect. Essence of malt 
is extracted by length of boiling, by which you can 
make it to the thickness of honey or treacle. In some 
parts of Yorkshire they value their liqncMr f&r its 
great strength, by its affecting the brain for two or 
three days after intoxication. This is the elSect rflong 
boiling; for in that county they boil liquor for three 
hours ; and what is still w orse, when it sink^ in th^ 
copper, fi-om the waste in boiling, they every now and 
then add a little fresh wort, which, without doubt, must 
produce stagnation, and, consequently, impurities. 

When your liquor is properly boiled, be sure to tra- 
verse a small quantity of it over all the coolers, so as 
to get a proper quantity cold immediately to set to 
work; but if the airiness of your brewhouse is not suf-^ 
ficient to expedite a quantity soon,- you must travarse 
a second quantity over the coolers, and then let it into 
shallow tubs. Put tiiese into any passage where there 
is a thorough draft of air, but where no rain or otii^ 



9«f wiii<4^. 339 

wet catt gettto it Then let oS the quantity of two 
foaring-rtul^full from the first one, the second and third 
coolers, which may be soon got cold, to be ready for a 
speedy working, and then the remaining part that is in 
your copper may be quite let out into the first cooler. 
In the mean time mend the fire, and also attend to the 
hops, to make a clear passage through the strainer. 

Having proceeded thus far, as soon as the liquor is 
done running, return to your businesis of pumping ; but 
be careful to remember, that, wb^ii you have got four 
pr five pails fiill, you then return all the hops into the 
copper for the ale. 

By this tim^ the small quantity of liquor traversed 
over your coolers being sufficiently cooled, you must 
proceed to set yow liquw tq work, the manper of doing 
which is as foUows : • ^ 

Takefeur qwrts of barm, and divide half of it into 
small vessels, such as clean bowls, basins, or mugs, add- 
ing thereto an equal quantity of wort, which should be 
almost cold. As soon as it ferments to the top of the 
vessel, put it into two pails, and when that works to 
the top, put one into a baring-tub, and the other into 
another. When yon have hsdf a baring-tub,full toge-^ 
ther, you may put the like quantity to each of them, 
and then cover them over, until it comes to a fine whitq 
head. This may be perfectly completed in three hours, 
and then put those two quantities into the working 
guile. You majnow add as much wort as yoq have 
got ready ; for, if*^the weather is open, you cannot Work 
it too cold. If you brew in cold frosty weather, keep 
the brewhouse warm : but never add hot wort to keep 
the liquor to a Wood beat, that being a bad maxim ; 
for hot wort put to cold, as well as cold to hot, is so 
in^iempef'ate in its nature, that it stagnates tlie proper 
operation of the barm. 

Be particularly careful that your barm be not from 
^ed beer, that is,-beer heated by iU management in 
its working; for in that case it is likely to carry with it 
the coniagion. If your barm be Sat, and you cannot 
procure that which is new, the method of *reeaveriftg* 
?9 



540 BREWING. 

*ts working is, by putting to it a pint of wami sweet 
wort, of your first letting off, the heat to be about half 
the degree of milk-warnn : then give the vessel that 
contains it a shake, and it will soon gather strength, 
and be fit for use. ^ ' ' 

With respect to the quantity of hops necessary to be 
used, remember that half a pound of good hops is suffi- 
cient for a bushel*of malt. 

, The last, and most simjile operation in the business 
of brewing is, that of tunning, the general methods 
of doing which are, either by having it carried into 
the cellar on men's shoulders, or conveying it thither 
by means of leathern pipes commonly used for that 
purpose. 

Your casks being perfectly cledn, sweet and dry, and 
placed on the stand ready to receive the liquor, first 
skim off the top barm, then proceed to fill your casks 
quite full, and immediately bung and peg them close. 
Bore a hole with a tap-borer near the summit of the 
stave at the same distance firom the top, as the lower 
tap-hole is from the bottom, for working through that 
upper hole, which is a clean and more effectual method 
than working it over the cask ; for, by the above me- 
thodi being so closely confined, it soon sets itself into a 
convulsive motion of working, and forces itself fine, 
provided you attend to the filling of your casks five or 
six times a day. This ought to be carefully attended 
to, for, by too long an omission, it begins to settle, and 
being afterwards disturbed, it raises a sharp fermen- 
tation, which produces an incessant working of a spu- 
rious froth that may feontinue for some weeks, and, 
afler all, give your beer a disagreeable taste. 

One material caution necessary to be kept in remem- 
brance is this : that however careful you may be in at- 
tending to all the preceding particulars, yet if your 
casks are not kept in good order, still the brewing may 
be spoiled. New casks are apt to give liquor a bad 
taste, if they are not well scalded and seasoned several 
days successively before they are used ; and old casks, if 
they stand any time out of use, are ant to grow musty. 



BREWING. 341 

Having tha3 gone throngh the practical part of brew- 
ing, and brought the liquor from the mash-tub to the 
cask, we shall now proceed to 

SECT. VIIL 

Containing the proper Mandgement of Malt Liquors, 
with some necessary Observations on the Whole. 

In order to keep strong beer in a proper state of pre- 
servation, remember, that when once the vessel is 
broached, regard inust be paid to the time in which it 
may be expended ; for, if there happens to be a quick 
draught for it, then it will last good to the very bottom ; 
but if there is likely ip be but a slow draught, then do 
not draw off quite half before you bottle it; otherwise 
it will grow flat, dead, or sour. 

In proportion to the quantity of liquor which is en- 
closed in one cask, so will it be a shorter or longer 
time in ripening. A vessel, which contains two hogs- 
heads of beer, will require twice as much time to per- 
fect itself as one of a hogshead ; and it is found, by ex- 
perience^ that no vessel should be used for strong beer 
(which is uitended to be kept) less than a hogshead, 
as one of that quantity, if it is fit to draw in a year, 
will have body enough to support it for two, three, 
or four years, provided it has a sufficient strength 
of malt and hops, which is the case with Dorchester 
beer. 

With respect to the management of small beer, the 
first consideration should be to make it tolerably good 
in quality, w^hich, in various instances, will be found 
•truly economical; for if it is not good, servants, for 
whom it is principally calculated, will be feeble in 
summer time, incapable of strong w^ork, and subject 
to various disorders. Besides, when the beer is bad, 
a great deal will be thrown away ; whereas, on the 
contrary^ good wholesome drink will be valued, and 
consequently taken care of. It is advisable therefijre, 
where there is a good cellaring, to brew a stock of 



^2 BkEWINO. 

small h^er in Mafch or October, or in both Aiohfhs, to 
he" fc^tj if pOBsiWe, in hogsheads. 

The beer brewed in March should not be tapped 
till October, nor that brewed in October till the March 
following; having tliis regard to the quantity, that 
a family, of the sam^ number of working people, will 
drink at least one third more in sumtner than in 
winter. 

In order to fine beer, some people, who brew with 
high dried barley malt, put a bag, containing about 
three pints of wheat into evei-y hogshead of liquor, 
which has had the di?sired effect, and made tlie beer 
drink soft and mellow. Others again, have put about 
three pints of wheat-malt into a hogshead, which haj» 
produced the like effect. 

But all malt liquors, however well they may be 
brewed, may be spoiled by bad cellaring; be subject 
to ferment in the cask, and consequently turn thick 
and sour. When this happens to be the case, the best 
way of bringing the liquor to itself is, to open the bung- 
hole of the cask for two or three days ; and if that does 
not stop the fermentation, then put in about two or 
three pounds of oyster shells, washed, dried w^ll in an 
oven, and then beaten to a fine powder. After you 
have put it in stir it a little, and it will soon settle 
the liquor, make it fine, and take off the sharp tiaste. 
When you find this effected, draw it off into another 
vessel, and put a small bag of wheat, or wheat-malt 
into it, in proportion to the size of the vessel. It 
sometimes occurs, that such ibrmentdtions will happen 
in liquor from a change of weather, if it is in a bad Cel- 
lar> and will, in a few months, fall fine of itself, and , 
grow mellow. 

In some country places remote from principal toWTis, 
it is a practice to dip whisks into yeast, then beat it 
well, and hang tip the whisks, with the yeast in them, - 
to dry; and if there be no brewing till two months 
afterwards, the beating and stirring one of the Whisks 
in new wort will soon raise a working or fermentation. 
It is a rtil^, that all liqnor should be worked well hi 



BBBWlNe. o43 

the twkf before it is put into the Tassd, otherwise it 
will not easily grow fine. Some follow the rule of 
beatui^ down the yeast pretty oft6n while it is in the 
tun, and keep it there working for two or three days, 
observing to put it into the vessel just when the yeast 
begins to fall. This liquor is ta general very fine, 
whereas, on the contrary, that which is put into the 
vessel soon after it is brewed will be several months 
before it comes to a proper state of perfection. 

We have before taken notice of the season for brew 
ing malt liquors to keep. But it may not be improper 
further to observe, that if the cellars are subject to the 
heat of the «un, or warm summer air, it will be best 
to brew in October, that the liquor may have time to 
digest before the warm season comes on ; and if cel- 
lars are subject to damp, and to receive water, th^best 
time will be to brew in March. Some experienced 
brewers always choose to brew with the pale malt in 
March, and the brown in October; supposing, that the 
pale. malt, being made with a less degree of fire than 
the other, wants the summer sun to ripen it; and so, 
on the contrary, the brown, having had a larger share 
of tibe fire to dry it, is jnore capable of defending itself 
against the cold of the winter season. 

All that remains further to be said relative to the 
management of malt liquors, we shall preserve in 

SECT. IX. 

Containing the proper Method of bottling Malt 
Liquors. 

As a necessary preparation for executing this busi- 
' ness properly, great attention must be paid to your 
bottles, which must first be well cleaned and dried; 
for wet bottles will mako the liquor turn mouldy or 
mothery, as it is called ; and by wet bottles a great 
deal of good beer is fi*equently spoiled. Though the 
bottles may be clean and dry, yet, if the corks are not 
new^ and sound, the liquor will be still liable to bo 
damaged; for, if the an- can get into the bottles, the 
29* 



344 »ffBWiif0. 

liquor will grow fist, and nevei* fide. Mitliy who haV6 
flattared themselves they knew how to be saving, by 
using old corks on this occasion, have spoiled as much 
liqaor as stood them in four or five pounds, only for 
want of laying out three or four shillings. If bottled 
are corked as they should be, it will be dfificult to draw 
the cork without a sCTew; and to secure the drawing 
of the cork without breaking, the Bct^Vf otight to go 
through the cork, and then the air must necessarily find 
a passage where the screw has passed. If a cork had 
once been in a bottle, though it has not been drawn 
with a screw, yet that cork will turn musty as soon as 
exposed to the air, and will communicate its ill flavour 
to the bottle in which it is next put, and spoil the liquor 
that way. In the choice of coiks, take those that are 
soft and dear from specks, You may also observe, in 
the bottling of liquor, that the top and middle of the 
hogshead are the strongest, and will sooner rise in 
the bottles than the bottom. When you begin to 
lx)ttle a vessel of any liquor, be sure not to leave it 
^ till ail is completed, otherwise it Will havfe 3ifletenl 
tastes. ^ 

If you find a vessel of liquoii begins to g^ow flat 
whilst it is in common draught, bottle it, and into etery 
bottle put a piece of loaf sugar of about the sifee of a 
walnut, which will make it rise and tome to itself: 
and, to forward its ripening, you may set some bottles 
in hay in a warm place ; but straw will not assist its 
ripening. 

If you should have the opportunity of brewing a 
good stock of small beer in March and October, some 
of it may be bottled at the end of six months, putting 
into every bottle a lump of loaf sugar; which, in the 
summer, Will make it a very pleasant and refreshing 
drittk. Or if you happen t# brew in summer, and 
are desirous of brisk small beer, as soon as it is doiie 
working) bottle it as before directed. 

Where your cellars happen not to be properly calcu- 
lated for the preservation of your beer, you may use 
the following expedient • Sink holes in the ground, put 



BSfittiNG. 345 

into them largeoilrjars, and fill up the earth close about 
the sides. One of the jars will hold about two dozen 
bottle:^:, and will keep the liquorin proper order ; but 
care must be taken that the tops of the jars are kept 
close covered. In winter time, when ttie weather is 
frosty, shut up all the lights or windows of your cellars, 
aij,tl cover them close with horse-dung, which will keep 
your beer in a very proper and temperate state. 

We shall close this section and chapter with that 
information, which, if properly attended to, may be 
found, at tinges, of the highedt conyenienee and utility. 

1\> Preserve Yeast. 

If you wish to preserve a large stock of yeast, which 
will keep and be of use for sevel-al months, either for 
brewing, or to make bread or cakes, you must follow 
these directions. When you have plenty of yeagt, and 
are apprehensive of a future scarcity, take a quantity 
of it, stir and work it well with a whisk, until it be- 
comes liquid and thin. Then get a large wooden platter, 
cooler or tub, clean and dry, and with a soft brush lay 
a thin layer of yeast on the tub, and turn the mouth 
downwards, that no dust may fall upon it, but so th«nt 
the au* may get under to dry it. When that coat is 
very dry, then lay on another, and so on till you have 
a sufficient quantity, even two or three inches thick, 
idways taking care that the yeast is very dry in the 
tub before you lay any more on, and this wUl keep 
good for several months. When you have occasion to 
use this yeast, cut a piece off, and l^y it into warm 
water ; then stir it together, and it will be fit for use. 
If it is for brewing, take a large handful of birch tied 
together, dip it into the yeast, and hang it up to dry. 
In this manner you may do as many as you please; 
but take care no dust com^s to it. When your be^ is 
fit to set to work, throw in one of these, aod it will 
make it work as well as if you had made^fre&h yeasts

CHAPTER XXX. 

DIRECTIONS FOR TRUSSING POULTRY, fc^. 

THERE are various reasons why the experienced 
and prudent housekeeper should be properly acquaint- 
ed with tliis necessary preparation to the Art of 
Cookery. In London every article is generally trussed 
by the poulterer of whom it is bought ; but it frequent- 
ly happens that, either from inexperience or negligence 
of the servants, and want of knowledge in the cook, 
the article appears on the^ table with disgrace. Another 
very substantial reason for the cook having this know 
ledge is, thajt the families in which they serve are fre- 
. quently in counties where there are no poulterers, and 
• consequently they are under the necessity of killing 
and trussing their own poultry. To be prepared, 
therefore, for tha^xecution of this business, we recom- 
inehd a proper attention to the following general rules 
1)6 careful that all the stubs are perfectly taken out ; 
' and when you draw any kind of poultry, you must be 
, \'cry particular to avoid breaking tlie gall, for should 
that happen, no means can be used to take away that 
bitterness, which will totally destroy the natural and 
proper taste of the article dressed. Great care should 
likewise be taken that you do not break the gut join- 
ing to the gizzard ; for, should this hapoen, the inside 
will be gritty, and the whole spoiled. jThese are to be 
attended to- as general matters. We shall proceed to 
particulars, beginning with 

Turkeys. 

Having properly picked your turkey, break the leg 
bone close to the foot, and draw out the string from 
the- thigh, for which purpose you must hang it on a 
hook fastened against the wall. Cut off the neck close 
to the back ; but be careftil to leave the crop skin suffi- 
ciently long to turn over the back. Then proceed to 
take out the crop, and loosen the liver and gut at the 
throat end with your middle finger. Then cut off the

vent, and taike out the gut. Pull out the gizs^rd with 
a crooked, sharp pointed iron^ and the liver will soon 
follow; but be careful not to break the gall. Wipe 
the inside perfectly clean with a wet cloth; having 
done which, cut the breast-bone through on each side 
close to the back, and draw the legs close to the crops. 
Then put a cloth on the breast, and beat the high bone 
down with a rolling-pin till it lies flat. If the turkey 
is to be trussed fof boiling, cut the legs off; then put 
youl* middle finger into the inside, raise the skin of the 
legs, and put them under the apron of the turkey. 
Put a skewer into the joint of the wing dnd the middle ' 
joint of the leg, and rUn it through the body and the 
other leg and wing. The liver atid gisszard must be 
put in the pinions; but be careful first to open the 
gizzard and take out the filth, and the gall of the liver. 
Then turn the small end of the pillion on the back, 
and tie a packthread ovet* the ends of the legs to keep 
them in their places. If the turkey is to be roasted, 
leave the legs on, put a skewer in the joint of the wihg, 
tuck the legs close up, and put the skewer through 
the middle of the legs and body. On the other side, 
put another skewer in at the small part of the leg. 
Put it close on the outside of the sidesman, and put 
the skewer through, and the same on the other side. 
Put the liver and gizzard between the pinions, and 
turn the point of the pinion on the back. Then put, 
close above the pinions, another skewer through the 
body of the turkey. 

If turkey-poults, they must be trussed as follow : 
take the neck from the head and body, but do not re- 
move the neck skin. They are drawn in the same 
'manner as a turkey. Put a skewer through the joint 
of the pinion, tuck the legs close tip, run the skewer 
through the middle of the leg, through the body, and 
so on the other side. Cut off the under part of the 
bill, twist the skin of the neck round, and put the head 
on the point of the skewer, with the bill- end forwards. 
Another skewer must be put in the sidesman, and the 
1^ placed between the sidesman and apron on each^ 



348 TKU&SI50 

side. Pass the skewer through all, and ctit off tiie 
toe-nails. It is very common to lard them on the 
breast. The liver and gizzard may or may not be 
used, as you like. 

Fowls. 
When yon have properly picked yonr fowls, cut oft 
the neck close to the back. Then take out the crop; 
and with your middle finger loosen the liver and other 
matters. Cut off the vent, draw it clean, and beat 
the breast-bone flat with a rolling-pin. If your fowl 
is to be boiled, cut off the nails of the feet, and tuck 
them down close to the legs. Put your finger into 
the inside, and raise the skin of the legs; then cut a 
hole in the top of the skin, and put the legs under. 
Put a skewer in the first joint of the pinion, bring the 
middle of the leg close to it, put the skewer through 
the middle of the leg, and through the body; and tJien 
do the same on the other side. Having opened the 
gizzard, take out the filth, and the gall out of the liver. 
Put the gizzard and the liver in the pinion, turn the 
pomts on the back, and tie a string over the tops of the 
legs to keep them in their proper place. If your fowl 
is to be roasted, put a skewer in the first joint of the 
pinion, and bring the middle of the leg close to it. Put 
the skewer througli the middle of the leg, and through 
the body, and do the^ame on the other side. Put an- 
other skewer in tho small of the leg, and through the 
sidesman ; do the same on the other' side, and then 
put another through the skin of the feet. You must 
not forget to cut off the nails of the feet. 

Chickens. 
With respect to picking and drawing, they must ' 
be done in the same manner as fow^ls. If they are to 
be boiled, cut off the nails, give the sinews a nich on 
each side of the joint, put the feet in at the vent, and 
then peel the rump. Draw the skin tight ouer the legs, 
put a skewer in the first joint of the pinion, and bring 
the middle of the leg close. Put the skewer through 
the middle of the legs, and through the body, «)d do 



POUJuTRT. 349 

ike fiamis on the other side. Clean the giasasard, and 
take out the g^l in the liver ;. put them into the pinions, 
and turn the points on the back. If your chickens are 
to be roasted, cut off the feet, put a ^ewer in the first 
joint of tlie pinioiis, and bring the middle of the leg 
close. Run the skewer thorough the middle of the leg, 
and tiirough the body, and do the same on the other 
side. Put another skewer into the sidesman, put the 
legs between the apron and the sidesman, and run the 
skewe through. Having cleaned the \\\ex and giz- 
zard, put them in tl^e pinions,, turn the points on the 
back, and pull the breast skin over the neck. 

Geese. 

Having picked and stubbed your goose clean, cut 
the feet oflf at the joint, and the pinion oflf the first joint. 
Then cut off the neck almost close to the back ; but 
leave the skin of the neck long enough to turn over 
the back. Pull out the throat, and tie a knot at the 
end. With your middle finger loosen the liver and* 
other matters at the breast end, and cut it open be* 
tween the vent and the rump. Having done this, draw^ 
out a^ the entrails, excepting the soul. Wipe it out 
clean with a wet cloth, and beat the breast bone flat 
with, a rolling-pin. Put a skewer into the wing, and 
draw the legs close up. Put the skewer tiirough the 
middle of the leg, and through the body, and the same 
on the other side. Put another skewer in the small 
of the leg, tuck it close down to the sidesman, run it 
through, and do the same on the other side. Cut off 
the end of the vent, and make a hole large enough for 
the passage of the rump, as by that means it will much 
* better keep in the seasoning. 

Ducks are trussed in the same manner, except that 
the feet must be left on, and turned close to the legs. 

Pigeons. 

When you have picked them, an^ji cut off the neck 
close to the back, then take out the crop, cut off the. 
vent, and draw out. the guts and gizzard, but leave 



350 TRUSSING 

the fiver, far a pigeon has no gall. If they »e to be 
roasted, cot ofl' the toes, cat a slit in one of the legs, 
and put the other through it. Draw the leg tight to 
the phiion, put a skewer through the pinions, le^, and 
body, and with the handle of the knife break the breast 
flat. Clean the gizzard, pnt it in one of the pinions, 
and tnrn the points on the back. If yoo intend to make 
a pie of them, yoo must cut the feet off at the joint, 
turn the legs, and stick them in the sides close to the 
pillions. If they ape to be stewed or boiled, they must 
be done in the sanse manner. 

Wild Fowl. 

Having picked them clean, cut off the neck close 
to the back, and with your middle finger looseii the 
liver and guts next the taneast. Cut off the pinions at 
the first joint, then cut a slit between the vent and the 
lump, and draw them clean. Clean them properly 
with the long feathers on the wing, cnt off the nails, 
and tarn the feet close to the legs, Pat a skewer in 
the pinion, pull the legs close to the breast, and ran 
the skewer through the legs, body, and the other pin- 
ion. First cut off the vent, and then pat the rump 
through it. The directions here given ape to be fi)l- 
towed in trussing ev«y kind of wild fowl. 

f^heasav^U and Partridges. 

Having picked them very clean, cut a ^t at the 
back of the neck, take out the crop, and loosen the 
liver and sfut next the breast with your fore-finger, 
then Qnt off th0 vent and draw them. Cut oS the 
pinion at the first joint, and wipe out the inside with 
the pinion you have cut off. Beat the breast bone flat 
with a rolHno^pin, put a skewer m the pinion, and brinf^ 
tlie middle of the legs close. Then run the rfcewer 
through the^ legs, body, and the other pinion, twist 
the head, and put it on the end of the skewer, with the 
bill fironting the hreast. Pnt another skewer kito the 
i^esman, and put the legs close on each side tiie apron, 
and then ran tbo skewer through all. If yon wmM 



wifAk to make tkc phea^titit (if it i^ ^ coek) haVe a plea- 
«iog appearance on the table, leave the beaoliful fea- 
thers Ofl the head, and cover them gently with paper 
to prevent their being iniured by the heat of the ire 
. Yoa may likewise save the long feathers in the tail to 
stick in the rump when roasted. If they are for boil 
ing, pot the legA in the same iMnner lis in trussing a 
fowl. 

Ail kinds of moor game must be trussed in the same 
manner. 

Woodcocks mid Sniper. 

As these birds are remarkably tender to pick, espe- 
cially if they should not happen to be quite fresh, the 
•greatest care must be taken how you handle thetn ; for 
isv&R the heat of the hand will sometimes take off the 
sldn, which will totally destroy the beautiful appear- 
ance of the bird. Having picked them clean, cut the 
|Kiiik>n9 of the first joint, and with the handle of a knife 
beat the bfeast-bone fiat. Turn the legs close to the 
thighs, and tie them together at the joints. Pat tlie 
thigh close to the pinions, put a skewer into the pin- 
ioKS, and rttn it through the thighs, body, and the 
other pinion. Sfciii the head, turn it, take out the eyes, 
and put the head on the point of the skewer, with the 
hill otoee to the breast. Remember, that these birds 
must «erer be drawn. 

Larks. 

When you have picked them properly, cot off their 
Jtieads, and the pinions of the first joint. Beat the? 
breast-bone flat, and turn the feet close to the legs, 
and put one into the other. Draw out the gizzard, 
^nd run- a skewer through the middle of the bodies. 
Tie the skewer fast to the spit when you put them 
down to roast. Wheat ears, and other small birds, 
must Be done in the same manner. 

Hares. 

Having cut off the four legs at the first joint, raise 
the skin of the back, and draw it over the hind legs. 
Leave the taQ whole, draw the skin over the back, 
30 



S52 TRUSSING POULTRT. 

and slip out the fore-legs. * Cut tbe skin off the neek 
and head; but take care to leave the ears on, and 
mind to skin them. Take out the liver, lights, &c. 
and be sure to draw the gut out of the vent. Cut the 
sinews that lie under the hind-legs, bring them up to 
the fore-legs, put a skewer through the hind-leg, then 
through the fore-1^ under the joint, run it through the 
body, and do the same on the other side. Put another 
skewer through the thick part of the hind-legs and 
body, put the head between the shoulders, and run a 
skewer through to keep it in its place. Put a skewer 
in each ear to make them stand erect, and tie a string 
round the middle of the body over the 1^ to keep 
them in their place. A young fawn must be trussed 
just in the same manner, except that the ears must be 
cut off. 

Rabbits must be cased much in the same manner 
as hares, only observing to cut off the ears close to the 
head. Cut open the vent, and slit the legs about an 
inch up on each side of the rump. Make thehind-1^ 
lie flat, and bring the ends to the fore-legs. Put a 
skewer into the hind-leg, then into the fore-leg, and 
through the body. Bring the head round, and put it 
on the skewer. If you want to roast two t<^ether, 
truss them at full length with six skewers run through 
them, both, so that they may be properly fastened on 
the spit.

THE NEW 
FA1MIZL7 ASCEZFT-BOOX. 



Oerman method of Clarifying and Preserving Fresh Butter. 

A VALUABLE article, the original communication of an ingenious 
traveller, who resided fnany years in Germany. " The peculiar ad- 
vantage of clarified butter," says this gentleman, " though but little 
known in England, is unequalled for most culinary purposes, for fry- 
ing, and for general use in long sea-voyages, where no fresh butter 
is to be had. Indeed this purified butter is equal to the best virgin 
oils of Florence, Aix, or Lucca, for frying in perfection. At Vienna, 
and in many other parts of Germany, it is sold in all the shops. The 
best is purified at the dairies, during the cheapest season, and sent 
to market in barrels and tubs ; it is then clari^ed. Set a large clean 
tinned copper vessel on a trivet, over a charcoal fire ; and put in the 
new butter, before it has taken any ill taste, but not in large portions 
at a time. With (he quantity of about fifty pounds, add a large 
onion peeled and cut crossway. The whole must be closely watched, 
and kept skimming the moment it begins to boil ; and the fire then 
slackened, that it may only simmer for five minutes ; after which, if 
it cannot be suddenly removed, the fire to be immediately extinguish* 
ed. The onion then taken out, the butter to be left standing till every 
impurity sinks to the bottom ; as all that has not risen to the skimmer 
never fails doing. Large tin canisters, stone jars, or wooden ves- 
sels made air-tight, holding about fifty pounds each, should receive 
the liquid butter, and be kept closely covered up for use. This but- 
ter should be constantly taken out as it is wanted, with a wooden 
spoon ; neither the hand, nor any metal, ever suffered to touch it." 

Queen Elizabeths Cordial Electuary, 

Boil a pint of the best honey ; and, having carefully taken off 
all the scum, put into the clarified liquid a bundle of hyssop which 
has been well bruised, previously to tying it up, and let them boil to- 
gether till the honey tastes strongly of the hyssop. Then strain out 
the honey very hard ; and, putting into it a quarter of an ounce eacn of 
powdered liquorice root and aniseed, half that quantity of pulverized 
elecampane and angelica roots, and one pennyweight each of finely 
beaten pepper and ginger, let the whole boil together a short time, 
being well stirred all the while. After which, pour it into a gallipot, 
. or a small jar, and continue stirring till it is quite cold. Keep it co- 
vered up for use ; and, whenever troubled with straitness at the sto- 
mach, or shortness of breath, take some of the electuary on a brui- 
sed stick of tiquorice, which will speedily afford relief. This is 
said to have been Queen Elizabeth's favourite remedy for all oppres- 
sion at the stomach and shortness of breath, with which complaints 
her majesty had been much afflicted ; she lived till seventy-three 
years of age*

b,eyCm la the next place', lay the lower part of the back upwards in 
your plate, with the rump from you, and cut off the side-bones, (or 
sidesmen, as they are generally ealled,) by forcing the knife through 
the rump-bone, in the line e^J\ when your fowl will be completely 
cut up, 

BaiUd F(Ad. 
Ws have before bhaerved, that a boiled fowl is cut up in the same 
manner as one roasted. In the representation of this the fowl is com- 
plete, whereas in that part of the other it is in part dissected. Those 
parts, which are generally considered as the most prime, are t'Be 
wings, breast, and merry-thought, imd next to these the neck^bones, 
and sidesmen. The legs of boiled fowls are more tender than those 
that are roasted ; but every part of a chicken is good and juicy. As 
the thigh bones of a chicken are s^ry tender, and easily broken with 
the teeth, the gristles and marrow render them very delicate. la the 
boiled fowl the leg should be separated from the drum-stick, at the 
joint, which is easily done, if the knife is introduced into the hollow, 
and the thigh-bone turned back from the leg-bone. 

Partridge. 

The Partridge is here represented as just taken from the spit ; but 
before it is served up, the skewers must be withdrawn. It is cut up 
in the same manner as a fowl. The wings must be taken off in tbe 
lines a, 6, and the merry-thought in the line c, d. The prime parts 
of a partridge are, the wings, breast, and merry-thought. The wing 
is considered as the best, and the tip of it reckoned the most delicate 
morsel of the whole. 

Pigeons, 

Here are the representations of two, the one with the back upper- 
most, and the other with the breast. — That with the back uppermost 
is marked No. 1. and that with the breast No. 2. Pigeons are some- 
times cut up in the same manner as chickens. But as the lower 
part, with- the thigh, is in general most preferred, and as, from its 
small size, half a one is not too much for most appetites, they are 
seldom carved now, otherwise than by fixing the fork at the point «, 
entering the knife just before it, and dividing the pigeon into two, 
cutting away in the lines a, 6, and a, r, No. I, at the same time bring- 
ing the knife out at the back, in the direction a, 6, and a, e, No. 9* 

A Pheasant. 
In the representation here given, the bird appears in a proper 
Bt^te for the spit, with the head tucked under one of the wings. 
When laid in the dish, the skewers drawn, and the bird carried to 
table, it must be carved as follows : fix your fork on that part of the 
breast where the two dots are marked, by which means you will have 
a full command of the bird, aod can turn it as you think proper. 
Slice down the breast in the lines a, 6, and then proceed to take off 
the leg on one side, in the direction d, f, or in the cirfulftC ^ellsd

line hfd^ Tbn done, eut criOTthe wing on the sanie side, in the line 
c, tL When- you have separated the leg and wing on one side, do 
the same on the other, and then cut off, or separate from the breasU 
bone, on each side of the breast, the parts you before sliced or cut 
down. Be very attentive in taking off the wing. Out it in the 
notch a, for if you cut too near the nebk, as at ^, you will find your- 
self interrupted by the neck-bone, from whence the wing must be 
separated. Having done this, cut off the merry^tbought in the line 
/> ffi ^y passing the knife under it towards the neck. With respect 
to the remaining parts, they are to be cut up in the same manner as 
directed for a roast fowl. The parts most admired in a pheasant are, 
fifst, the breast, then the wing^^ and next the merry-thought. 

A Goose. 

Let the neck-end lie before you, and begin by cutting two or 
three long slices on each side the breast, in the lines a, b, quite to tiie 
bone. Cut these slices from the bone, then take off the leg, turning 
the goose up on one side, putting the fork through the small end of 
the leg bone, and pressing it close to the body, which, when the knife 
has entered at d, will easily raise the joint. Then pass the knife 
under the leg in the direction fly e. If the leg hangs to the carcase, 
at the point e, turn it back with the fork, and, if the goose is young, 
it will easily separate. Having removed the leg, proceed tp take off 
the wing, by passing the fork through the small end of the pinion, 
' pressing it close to the body, and entering the knife at the notch c, 
and passing it under the wing in the direction c, r/. This is a very 
nice thing to hit, and can only be acquired by practice. When yuu 
have taken off the leg and wing on one side, do the same on the 
other. Then cut off the apron in the line/, e, gy having done which, 
take off the merry-thought in the line t, A. AH the other parts are to 
be tfikeo off in the same, manner as directed for the fowl. A goose 
is seldom quite dissected, unless the company is very large, in which 
case the above method must be pursued. 

The parts of a goose most esteemed are, the slices from the 
breast; the fleshy part of the wing, which may be divided Irom the 
pinion ; the thigh-bone, (or drutp-stick as it is called,) the pinion, and 
the side-bones. If sage and onions ave put into the body of the goose, 
(Wiiich is by most approved of,) when you have cut off the limbs, 
draw it out with a. spoon at the place from whence the apron is taken, 
and mix it with the gravy, which should first be poured boiling hot • 
into the body of the goose. Some people are particularly fond of the 
rump, which, afler being nicked with- a knife, is peppered and salted, 
and then broiled till it is of a nice light brpwn ; and this is distin- 
guished by the epijthet of a deviL The same is lULowise done by theu 
rump of a turkey. ^

eiost. 

This joint is always roasted, and when it comes to table, before 
you can help any one, you must separate the shoulder frpm 4te breast 
and ribs, (or what is by some called tbe coast,) by passing thoJuufe 
under, in tbe direction r, g^ d, e. The shoulder, being then take^ 
off, the juice of a lemon, or Seville orange, should be a<yAeezed upon 
(he part it was taken from, a little salt added, and the shoulder ro^ 
placed. The gristly part roust then be separated from the ribs in the 
line /, g, and then all the preparatory business to serving will bo 
done. The ribs are generally most esteemed, and one, two, or naoro 
may be easily separated from the rest, in the line a, h ; but tQ those 
who prefer the gristly part, a piece or two may be cut off in the lioea 
h, t, &c. If you should have a fore-quarter of grass, lamb th^ktruna 
hirge, the shoulder, when cut off, must be put into another iUbf end 
carved in the same manner as a shoulder Qf nuiltop.

the neck, which may be eat off in the line /, g. The next best parte 
are the ribs, which may be divided in the Uae e 9 ^ &e. and the othere 
are pieces cut from the lege end shoulders. Indeed tbe bonee efo

loins together, the back-bone running down the middle of the taiU 
When you carve it you must cut a long slice in either of the fleshy 
parts, on the side of the back-bone, in the direction a\ b» There is 
seldom eny great length of tail lefl on, but if it is sent up with the tail,' 
many will be fond of it, and it may be easily divided into seyerat 
pieces, by cutting between the jqints of the tail, which are about an 
inch apart. 

A Cod's Head:. 

Fish in general requires very little carving, the fleshy parts being 
those principally esteemed. A cod's head and shoulders, when in 
eeason, and properly boiled, is a very genteel and handsome dish. 
When eat, it should be done with ^ spoog^ fiah-irowel, and the paru 
about the bsick-bone cm the shoulders a»e ihe most firm and best. :

in the difocUon d^f* itboat the head are many delicate parts^ soma

A Calfs Head. 
Ik carving this, begin bj cutting tbe flesh' quite along the cfa^k 
bone, in the direction c, b, from whence several handsome slices majr 
be taken. In the fleshy part, at the end of the jaw-bone, lies part of 
the throat-sweet^bread, which may be cut into^ in tbo line c, d, and 
which IS esteemed the best part in the head. Many like the eje, 
n^eh is to be cut from its socket a, by forcing the poial of the kpife 
down to the bottom of one edge of tbe socket, and - cutting quite 
round, keeping the point of the knife slanting towards tbe middle, so 
as to separate the meat from the bone. The palate is also reckoned 
by some very delicate ; it lies on the under side of the roof of the 
mouth ; is a wrinkled, white, thick skin, and may be easily separated 
from the bone by a knife, by raising the head with your lefl hand. 
There is also some nice tender bits on the under side, covering the 
under jaw, and some ^delicately gristly fat to be pared oflT about the 
ear, g» In the upper-jaw is the large tooth behind, which, having se- 
veral cells, and being full of jelly, is called the sweet- tooth ; but its 
delicacy is more in the name than any thing else. When you serve 
any person with a slice of the head, you must inquire whether they 
choose to have any of the tongue and brains, which are generally 
served up in a separate dish. A slice from the thick part of the. 
tongue, near the root, is the best. 

'Leg of Mutton. 

A LEG of wether Mutton, which is by far the best flavoured, maj 
be readily known by the kernel, or little round tump of fat, just above 
the letters a, e. This jc^nt, whether boiled or roasted, is carved in 
the same manner. The person who does this business should turn 
the joint towards him as it here lies, the shank to the left hand ; then 
holding it steady with bis fork, he should cut it deep on the fleshy 
part, in the hollow of the thigh, quite to the bone, in the direction 
ri, 6« Then will he cut it right through the kernel of fat called the 
papers eye, of which many are particularly fond. The mOst juicy 
parts of the leg are in the thick part of it, from the litie a, 6, upward, 
towards e ; but many prefer the drier part, about the shank or 
knuckle, which some call the venison part, from 4ts eating so ishert ; 
but this is certainly the coarsest part of the joint. The fat lies 
chiefly on the ridges f, <», and is to be cut in the direction e,f. In 
Older to cut out wfcat is by some called the cramp-bone; and by others 
tbe gentleman's bone, you must take hold of the shank-boae with 
your leH, hand^ and cutting down to the thigh-bone at the point </, 
then passing the knife under the cramp-bone, in the direction c/, C| it 
may easily be. cut oat 

A Ham. 

A HAM is cut two ways, either across in the line 6, c, or in the eur- 
cukr line in the middle, taking out a snoall piece as at a, and cutting 
thm slices in a cicciikur durectioo, thus enlarging it by d^reea. Thift

Ptcc« of Sirl^n cflBeef. ^ 

As a whole aiiii>ia is too Urge ^ families in geaenil, fo we have 
here only represented a part, either of whidi raotA to earned in the , , 
same manner. li is drawn a« standing up in the dtsh, in order to show 
the inside, or upper part ; but when seat to taUe, it is always laid 
down, so that the part described by the ^ter. c, lies ctose on the 
dish. The part c, d^ then lies uppermost, and the.hne oi,' ^, under- 
neath. The meat on the upper side of the rths is firmer, and^ a 
closer texture, than the- ieshy part underneath, whi<^ is by fttr the 
most tender, and of course preferred by many. To those who like 
the upper side, the outside slice should be first cut o9^^uite dewn to * . 
the bone, in the direction c, d. Some people, however, instead ol 
beginning to carve at either end, cut it in the middle of the mosi 
fleshy part. For those who prefer the inside, several sUees may be 
cut in the direction of the line a, 6, pressing the knife down to the 
bone. But wherever the slices are cut they iiaust be of a moderate 
substance, neither too thick nor too thin. 

E^-Une of Beef. 
The outside of this joint is generally injured in its flavour from 
the water in which it is boiled ; a thick slice must therefore be*c:^ 
off, the whole length of the joint, beginnjiig at r/, and cnjtting it W 
the way even and through the whole surface, frosi a to L The soil 
fat, which resembles marrow, lies oa the back below the-4etter ^^ 
and the firm fat must be out in thin l^^fizQnial slices at the points c ; 
but as some people like the sof), m^ some the firm fat, it is neces- 
sary to ask the company which they prefer. The upper part, as it 
is generally placled in the di«ih, is the handsomest, full^ of gravy, 
most tender, and enriched with fat ; but there are some who pr<6Cer 
a slice from the under-sidoj though it is lean and dry. The skewer 
that keeps the meat properly together when botfog is here shown at 
a. This should be drawn out before it is served up ; ot, if it is ne« 
cessary to leave the skewer in, it al^uld h0 a silver one; 

Brisket cf Beef 

This is a part always boiled, and must be cut in th^e^dlr^tton a, h^ 
quite down to the bone, aft^ having cut off the outside, or first slicfii, 
which must be cut pretty thick, ^e fat cut with this slice is a. firmt 
gristly fat, but ^softer fat is feund underneath for those who pre- 
fer it. ' ' 
Breast of Veal. 

A breast of veal must be cut across quite through, dividii^ thfi 
gristles from the rib-bones : this is called cutting the brisket from the 
ribs. The brisket may be out into pieces as waated $ jR^r aeme pre«> 
fer this part to the ribs. There requires no great direetiott how to . 
separate the ribs, sinpe nothing more is required than to put the 
kai& in atthe 4op between any two, and continue downwards till

FiUetofVeal. 

This part of the calf is the same as that called the buttock in the 
ox. Many people think the outside slice of a fillet of veal a delicacy, 
because it is most savoury ; but as some think otherwise, the ques- 
tion should be asked before any one is helped. If no one choosea 
the first slice, lay it in the dish, and the second cut will be exceedmg 
white and delicate ; but take care to cut it even and close to the 
bone. A fillet of veal is always stufi^d under the skirt or flap, with 
a pudding, or^ forcemeat. This you must cut deep into, in a Iin« 
with the surface of the fillet, and take out a thin slice. This, and a 
thin slice of ftft cut from the skirt, must be given to eadi person 
at table. 

Sparerib of Pork. 

This is carved by catting out slices in the thick part at the bottom 
of the bones. When the fleshy part is all cut away, the bones, which 
are .esteemed very sweet picking, may be easily separated. Fqw 
people admire the gravy of pork, it being too strong for most 
stomachs* 

Babbits. 

To unlace a rabbit, the back must be turned downward, and the 
apron divided from the belly. This done, slip your knife between 
the kidneys, loosening the flesh on each side. Then turn the belly, 
cut the back crossways between the wings, and draw your knife 
down both sides of the back-.bone, dividing the sides and legs from 
the back. Observe not to pull the leg too violently from the bone» 
when you open the side ; but with great exactness lay open the sides 
from scut to^boulder^ and then put the legs together. 

fVoodcocks. 

To thigh a woodcock, you mtnt raise the legs and wings in the 
same manner as you do a fowl, only open the head for the brains. 
In like manner you thigh curlews, plovers, or snipes, using no other 
sauce than salt. 

Mallards or Ducks. 

To unbrace a mallard or duck, first raise the pinioBs and legs, but 
do not cut them off. Then raise the merry-thought from the breast, 
and lace it down both sides with your knife. 

Buttock of Beef. 

This part is always boiled, and requires little directions as to the 
carving of it. A thick slice should be first taken off all round it. 
When you come to the juicy and prime part of it, you must be careful 
to cut it even, that it may have a graceful figure, should it be broughl 
to table cokl the next day. .

ART OF CARVING. 



NOTHING can be more disagreeable to a person who is placed 
nc the head of a table, and whose business it is to pay the necessary 
honours to guests invited, thaii to be defective in not being properly 
able to carve the different articles provided. From the want of 
knowledge in this particular, it must naturally become no less painful 
to the person who undertakes the task, than uncomfortable to those 
who are waiting for the compliment oif being served. Abilities and 
dexterity in this art are striking qualifications in the eyes of every 
company, and are material instruments of forming the necessary and 
polite graces of the taEle. « 

The instructions here laid down by words, are materially enliven- 
ed by the representations of the respective articles described, so that 
the young and inexperienced may, by proper attention to the descrip* 
tion, and reference to the plates, soon make themselves proficients 
in this useful and polite art. 

We shall commence the subject with describing the method of 
carving ^ , 

A Roast Fowl. 

In the plate the fowl is placed in the centre, and is represented as 
lying on its side, witn one of the legs, wings, and neck-bone, taken 
off. Whether the fowl is roasted or boiled, it must be cut up in the 
same manner. A roasted fowl is sent to table nearly yi the same 
manner as a pheasant, excepting that the pheasant has the Read 
tucked under one of the wings, whereas the fowl has the head cut off 
before it is dressed. In a boiled fowl (which is represented in the 
same plate) the legs are bent inwards, and tucked into the belly ; but, 
previous to its. being sent to table, the skewees are withdrawn. The 
most convenient method of Ciitting up a fowl is to lay it on your 
plate, and, as you separate the joints, in the line a, 6, d^ put Uiem 
into the dish. 

The legs, wings, and merry-thought being removed, the next thing 
is to cut off the neck-bones. This is done by putting in the knife at. 
gj and passing it under the long broad part of the bone in the line g^ bj 
then liding it up, and breaking off the end of the shorter part of the 
bone, which cleaves to the breast-bone. All the parts being thus 
separated from the carcase, divide the breast from the back, by cut- 
ting through the tender ribs on each side, from the neck quite down 
to the vent or tail. Then lay the back upwards oh your, plate, fix 
your fork under the rump, and laying the edge of your knife in the. 
Jiiie 69 Cy c^and pressing if down, lifl up the tail, or lower part of tho.

4 TUR NEW FAKILV 

Oenuine Vriar*» Balsam 

Put four ounces ofsarsaparilla cut in short pieces, two oonces of 
phina root sliced thia, and an ounce of Virginian snake-weed cut 
small, with one quart of spirits of wine, in a two quart bottle. Set 
it in the sun, or any eoual degree of beat, ihaking it two or three 
times a day, till the spirit be tinctured of a fine golden yellow. Then 
clear off the infusion into another bottle ; and, putting in eight ounces 
'of gum guaicum, set it in the sun, or other similar heat ; shaking it 
very of\en, till all the gam be dissolred, except the dregs, which will 
^nerally be about ten or twelve days. It must now be a second tinoe 
cleared from tbe dregs ; and, having received en oonce of Peruviao 
balsam^ be well shaken, and again placed in the son for two dajs ; 
afler which, an ounce of baka of Oilead being added) it in ta be once 
more shaken together, and finally set in the sun for fourteen tiays, 
when it will become quite fit for use, and keep many years. There 
werei formeriyt scarcely any complaints, either external or inCemid, 
t'ur which this admirable balsam was not considered as an efiectual 
remedy. It has, in truth, many virtues, when properly made ; but, 
as a mere vulnerary, for common flesh wounds, the simpler and 
cheaper balsams, sold under the names of Friar's Balsam, Turling-« 
ion's balsam, and the Traumatic Balsam of the London Dispensatory, 
are usually efikacious. Neither of these, however, nor any of the 
other compound balsams, or restorative drops, formed on the basis 
of this true Friar'^s balsam, are so well adapted for internal use ; and 
some of them, as commonly manufactured for sale, are quite unfit 
for any such purpose. The dose of genuine Friar's balsam, for 
cionsumptions, or any inward ulcer, &c. is about half a table spoon- 
ful, on a lump of sugar, or in any liquid vehicle, once or twice a day, 
according to the urgency of the case, using moderate exercise while 
in the habit, of taking it. In any soreness of the stomach, and for 
some coughs, twenty or thirty drops occasionally taken, often give 
complete relief; and, in almost every weakness or debility, they mav 
be advantageously resorted to, as well as by persons afflicted witn 
scorbutic complaints, and other taints or impurities of the blood. 

JEieedlent Lozenges, for the Hsart*bum. 

Ta«e calcined oyster shells, as fbund on the sea-coAst, where the/ 
are so blanched by time as to appear, both within and %vithout, of the^ 
Whiteness of mother of pearl ; dry them well by the fire, and then 
beat and sifl them as fine as possible, tn half a pound of this pow- 
der tnix half a pound of loaf sugar- well beaten and sifted ; and wet 
it wiUi a spoonful or two of milk and water, so as to form a very stiff 
paste. Then mould the whole into neat lozenges, of any form 
or size, and bake them very dry in so slack an oven as not to dis- 
colojir them ? this will be effected after every thing else is drawn. 
These lozenges so effectually destroy that acidity in the stomach 
which causes the heart-burn, as not only to prevent the disagreeable 
stensation it occasions, but greatly to promote digestion. Their pow- 
er fe neutralizing adds may be easily tried, by dissolving one of theiti 
in a glass of the sharpest vinegar.

a pot X)r pipkin with two quarts of water, covered closely up, and to 
he kept simmering till the liquor is reduced to a quart ; then to be 
poured off, and drank every morning, noon, and evening, about the 
third part of a pint each time. Half the quantity, or Jess, may be 
sufficient for chHdren, according to their respective ages, and the vio- 
lence of the disease. The most desperate condition of this painful 
^disorder has frequently beeq cured by this seemingly-simple remedy 
in little more than a month. It is best to keep making it fresh every 
two or three days, which indeefi h the case with most vegetable de* 
coctions. 

^ titHmnt Rdirffor a Pain and La^ State of the Bowels. 

Take twelve drops of laudanum in half a gill of spirituous cin- 
namon-water; or, if that cannot be* immediately had, in the best 
brandy. This will seldom fail to give instant relief; but, should it 
00 fail in the first instance, it may be repeated in about an hour« 

The true Daff^s EUocir. 

The popular medicine sold under this name is differently made by 
differex^ venders,. The following, however, is considered as the ge- 
nuine receipt for making it. — Take five ounces of aniseeds, three 
ounces of fennel-seeds, four ounces of parsley-seeds, six ounces of 
Spanish liquorice, five ounces of senna, one ounce of rhubarb, three 
ounces of elecampane-roc^t, seven ounces of jalap, twenty-one 
drachms of saffron, six ounces of manna, two pounds of raisins, a 
quarter of an ounce of dophineal, and two gallons of brandy* Stone the 
raisins, slice the roots, and bruise the jalap. Then mix the whole to- 
gether ; and, a(\er letting them stand close covered for fiileen days, 
strain out the ehxir. So favourite a remedy has Daffy's elixir been 
for all colicky p^ins, during the last hundred years, that many fa- 
milies have been enriched by its preparation and sale ; a few of whom 
there is reason to believe, have used not half the ingredients above 
enumerated. The cheap stuff, commonly sold fis,paffy's elixir, is 
little more than an infusion of aniseeds, liquorice, and jalap, in the 

coarsest an4 i7)Qst fiery malt spirit, lowered with common ^tet.

Infallible Remedy for the Ague. ^ 

Mix a quarter of an ounce each of finely powdered Peruvian bark, 
grains of paradise, and long pepper, in a quarter of a pound of trea 
cle; of which mixture,, take a diird part immediately as the cold fit 
commences, washing it down with half a quartern of the l^est French 
brandy. As the cold fit goes off, aod the fever' approaches, take a 
third part, with the like quantity of brandy ; and, on the following 
morning, fasting, swallow the remainder, and the same quantity of 
brandy as before. This excellent electuary, which is said never to ■ 
fail, perfectly cured an afflicted person, afler being most grievously * 
tormented for the greater part of four years, having almost every 
fit accompanied by delirium, during which period innugierable other

remedies bad been tried io vain. The person from wbom it was 
obtained, declared that be had cured many bundned persons, and ne- 
rer met with but a single instance where the three doses did not im- 
mediately efl^t a cure, and even then a second three completely 
prevailed. To children under nine years of age, only half the above 
quantities must be given. 

Bayley^s Patent Cakes for Liquid Blacking'^ 

This blacking has been the scource of an ample fortune to die 
patentee, the celebrated Mr. Bayley, of Cockspur-street, Chann^- 
cross, whose exclusive right has lately expired. It is made, accord- 
ing to the specification in the patent office, with one part of the 
gummous juice which issues from tlie shrub called govt's tboriif d«»- 
ring the months of June, July, and August ; four parts of rirer- 
water ; two parts of neat^s-foQt, or some other soAening and lubri- 
cating oil ; two parts of a deep blue colour, prepared from iron and 
copper ; and four parts o^ brown sugar candy. The water is then 
evaporated till the composition becomes of a proper consistence, 
when it is formed into cabes of such a size as to produce, wheo 
dissolved in hot water, a pint of liquid blacking. 

^n Incomparable Fumigation^ or Vapour, for a Sore Throats 

Take a pint of vinegar, and an ounce of myrrh ; boil them well 
together about half an hour, and then pour the liquid into a basin. 
Place over the basin the large part of a funnel which fits it ; and, 
the small end being taken into the month of the patient, the fume 
will be inhaled, and descend to the throat It must be used as _ 
hot as it can possibly be borne ; and should be renewed every qnar- 
ter of an hour, till a cure is effected. This excellent remedy will 
seldom or never fail, if resolutely persisted in, only for a day or 
two, and sometimes a very few hours, in the most dangerous state 
f^ either an inflammatory or putrid sore throat, or even a quinsy. 

Dr. Fulla^s Vapour for a ^insy, 

Taicb powdered pepper, one ounce ; milk, a quart ; and boil them 
to a pint and a half. Put the whole into a glass bottle with a small 
neck, and let the vapour be received as hot as can.be endured 
with open mouth. ^^ This euporiston,'' says that learned physican, 
'^ more powerfully than any gargle whatsoever, attenuates, raehs 
down, and draws forth, tough phlegm ; which, by obstructing the 
glands and spongy flesh, and hindering the free passage of blood 
and humours through them, occasions the inflammation and tumour ; 
and, therefore, it more effectually takes off this perilous distemper 
than any of them." This, it is to be remarked, is only recommend- 
ed for a quinsy/ It affords good professional authority, however, 
for the preferable use 4>f such vaporous inhalements over common 
gargles and other medicines, in dangerous complaints of the throat, 
lungs, &c.

Fine Red Ink. 
Bgil four ounces of best raspings of Brazil-wood, and one ounc« 
each of crystals of tartar tind powdered alum io^ a quart of the 
clearest river-water, till half the fluid be evaporated. While it is 
' yet sufficiently warm, dissolve in it an ounce each of double-refined 
sugar, and the whitest gum arabic. This fine ink is said to preserve 
its lively red hue much longer than any other known preparation for 
the same purpose. The common red ink, which is certainly far 
cheaper, and will do .very well for most occasions, is made by 
infusing four ounces of Brazil-wood raspings with two drachms of 
powdered alum, in a pint each of vinegar and rain-water, for two or 
•three days, and aflterward boiUng them over a moderate fire till a 
Ihird part ofv the fluid has evaporated. It is then to stand two or 
4hree days ; and, being filtered through blottmg-papei*, to be pre- 
served in closely-corked bottles for use. / 

Method of Cleansing and Polishing Rusty Steel. 
^ After well oiling the ru^y parte of the steel, let it remain two 
or three days in that state, then wipe it dry with clean rags, and po- 
lish with emery or pumice-stone, on hard wood. Frequently, how- 
ever, a little UDslacked lime, finely powdered, will be sufficient, af\er 
the oil is cleaned off. Where a very high degree of polish fs re- 
quisite, it will be roost e^ctually obtained by using a pa^te com- 
posed of finely levigated blood-stone and spirits of wine. Bright 
bars, however, are admirably cleaned in a few minutes, by using 
a small portion of fine corn emery, and afbrward finishing with 
fiour of emery or rotten-stone ; all of which may be had at any 
ironmonger's. This last very simple fliethod will, perhaps, render any 
other snpetfluoos* 

A fine Balsamic Elixir for confirmed Coughs and Consumptions^ 
Take a pint of the finest old rum, two ounces of balsam of 
Tolu, an ounce and a half of Strasbuiig turpentine, an ounce 
of powdered extract of Catechu, formerly called Japan earth, 
and half an ounce each of gum guaiacusi aiid'balsam of copavia. 
Mix them well together in the bottle ; and keep it near the 
fire, closely corked, for ten days, frequently well shaking it du- 
ring that time. Afterwards let it stand two days to settle, and pour 
ofif the clear for use. Half a pint of rum may then be poured over 
the dregs ; and, being treated for twelve days in the same manner 
as the first, will produce more elixir, and equally good. The dose 
. naay be from fifty to a hundred, or even two hundred drops, accord- 
ing to the urgency of the ease, taken twice or thrice a day in 
a wine glass of water. 

. Admiral Gascoigne^s Tincture of Rhxtharh.

then, having washed) scraped clean, and finely grated with a sbaip 
grater, two large sticks of fresh horse-radish, stir into the honey 
as much as you possibly can. It must remain in a boiling slate about 
five minutes, but stirred so as not to burn ; after which, put it into 
small earthen pots, or a jar, and keep it covered up for use. Two or 
three table spoonsful a day, or more, according to the strength of 
the patient, and some time persisted in, is said to perform wonders^ 
even where there is a confirmed phthisis pulmonalis, or consumption 
of the lungs. It is also serviceable in ail coughs where the huig» 
are greatly affected. 

Easy and e^etual Cure for Wens. 

PcTT a quantity o£ salt and water into a saucepan, and boil h four 
or five minutes ; with which, while tolerably hot, bathe the entire 
surface of the wen, however large ; and continue so to do, even 
after it is cold. Every time, before applying it, stir up the salt de- 
posited at the bottom of the basin, and incorporate it s^ain with the 
water. In this manner the wen must be robbed weM over, at least 
ten or twelve times e^ery twenty^our hoars ; and, fVequentty in less 
than a fortnight, a small discfaili^ takes place, without anjr . 
pain, which a gentle pressure soon assists to et^tptj die whole con-* 
tents. In particular instances, it is neoessary to continoe the appli^ 
cation several weeks, or even months : but it ik said al^ys flnaMif 
to prevail, where resolutely persisted in, and that wiliKiiit oc^iSflBtoning^

. Easy Method of denning Paper Hangings, 

Cut into eight half-quarter-sa quartern.loaf two days old; it latist 
neither be newer nor staler. With one of fiiese pieces, after haying 
blown off all the dust from the paper to be cleaned by means of a 
good pair of bellows, begin at the top of the room, holding the crust 
in the hand, and wiping lightly downward with the crumb, about half 
tt yard at each stroke, till the upper part of the hangings isieoiDplete- 
ly cleaned all rouad. Then go again round, With the like fl«>eefitBg^ 
stroke downward, always commencing each successive course a lit- 
tle higher than the upper stroke had extended, till the bottom be 
finished. This operation, if carefully performed, will frequently 
make very old paper look aknost equal to new. Great caution snust 
be used not by any means to rub the paper hard, nor to attempt clean* 
iiig it the cross or horizontal way. The dirty part of the br^d, too, 
must be each time cut away, and the pieces renewed as soon as at all 
necessary. 

Sir John HilVs Specific for the Scurvy, • 

Sir John's own description of this excellent remedy will convey 
its virtues. " There is in the hands of one person only a medicine 
of very great efficacy in the cure of the scurvy, leprosy, and other 
desperate cutaneous disorders. Its effect is certain ; but it is kept 
at so exorbitant a price, that only persons of fortune can have the 
advantage of it 

'^ A gentleman of great worth and goodness applied some months 
since to the person who possesses it, in favour of two daughters of a 
country clergyman.' He did not desire it should be given, but re- 
quested it at any moderate price. He was refused. A bottle of the 
medicine was aflerward procured, and put into my hands to exa- 
mine. It appeared to me, on many trials, to be an infusion of the root 
of the common great water-dock, and nothing else. I have made an 
infusion of that root, which perfectly agrees with it in taste, smell, 
and colour, and, what is more important, in virtues. 

.<< This is no modern invention ; the plant was long since known 
and celebrated ; it is the famous Britanvica anti quorum vera of au- 
tiiors, concerning which such wonders are recorded in the cure of 
scurvies ; but, like many other English plants, it has long been neg- 
lected. 

" I beg you to make this public for the service of those whom the 
common remedies have failed* to cure, and whose fortunes do not 
afford their going to the person hitherto possessed of the secret for 
redress. The method of infusion and decoction both will answer 
better than that by infusion alone, and what I have directed to' several 
who have found great benefit from it, is made thus : 

" Weigh half a pound of the fresh root of great water-dock, cut 
it into thin slices, put it in a stone jar, and pour upon it a gallon of

Rutsian Method of preserving Chreen Ptasfor tVintep^ 

Put into a kettle of boiling bot water any quantity of fresh-^elled 
fTMD peas ; and, after letting them just boil up, pour them into a 
^olandfar. When the liquor has drained away, empty them into a 
isrge thick cloth, cover them over with mother, make them quite dry, 
set them once or twice in a cool oven, to harden a little ; afler which 
put the peas mto paper bags, and hang them op in the kitchen for 
use. To prepare them, when wanted, they are finst wefl soaked 
lor an boor or more ; and then boiled in cold water, with a feW sprigs 
of mint, and a little bcitter. Green peas are sometimes kept m Eng- 
land, by scalding and drying alone, without putting, them in an oven ; 
they are afterward bottled hke gooseberries or damsons covered by 
clarified suet, closed up with cork and resin, and either buried in the 
earth or kept in a cool cellar ; being boiled, when wanted, till quite 
tender, with mint, butter, and sugar. This last article, at least, is 
Certainly an improvement on the Russian method. A dish of green 
peas, thus prepared, has sometimes agreeably surprised friends at a 
Christmas dinner. 

AdmiraMt Wash for ike Hair, said lo Tkicketi its Growth 
. better than Beards Grease, 

Take two ounces each of rosemary, maidenhair, southernwood, 
myttle berries, and bazel bark ; and bum them to ashes .on a dkaa 
hearth, or in an oven : with these ashes make a strong ley, with 
which wash the hair at the roots every day, and keep it cut short* 
This lixivium, or wash, it is said, will destroy the worm at the root ; 
and prove far more effectual than beards grease or pomatum, which 
rather feed than destroy that unsuspected enemy to the hair. 
Excellent Remedy for Swelled Legs and a Relaaxd Stomach* 

Taks six ounces of the common bitter infusion, consisting of g«»« 
tian root and outer rind of Seville omnge, with or wkiiout conander 
seeds ; one ounce of tincture of senna ; and a drachm of compound 
spirits of lavender. Mix them together, and take four spoonsful 
every other night on going to bed. To prevent swelled legs froa* 
breaking, mske a decoction of marshmallow leaves, rue, camomile^ 
and southernwood, boiled in a quart of ale or stale beer { and ibment 
them with flannels wrung out of the liquor, as hot as can be homo 
without scalding, three or four times a day. After bathrog, anoint 
them with a little ointment of marshmallows ; and should they even 
be broke, only cover the boles with dry lint, while bathing or foment-

Pine Rasphtrry V^inegar. 
Ttiid excellent article in domestic management is both grateful to 
the palate/and a very effectual remedy for complaints in the chest. 
It is made, at very little expense, in the following manner : Pour 
three pints of the best white-wine vinegar over a po md and a half 
of fine red^ raspberries, in a 6tone jar or china bowl, for neither gla- 
zed earthenware nor any metal must be used : the next day, strain 
the liquor over a like quantity of fresh raspberries ; and the day 
following do the same. Then drain the liquid as much as possible 
without pressing the fruit ; and pass it through a cotton bag previously 
wetted with plain vinegar, merely for preventing waste, into a stone 
jar, with a pound of loaf sugar' in large lumps to every pint of the 
vinegar. A& soon as the sugar is melted, stir the liquor, and put the 
jar into a saucepan of water, to simmer for some time ; skim it 
l^arefulty ; and, when cold, bottle if for use. *A large spoonful, in a 
Amall tumbler of water, with a very little sugar, makes a most plea- 
ftant and refreshing beverage, either for invalids or persons in health. 

Genuine Turlington^s Balsam. 

This is a very good vulaeraiy balsam for common uses ; and may 
be safely taken iateroally, where the genuii^e friar's balsam is not at 
hand* The receipt for making the true Turlington's balsam, or 
drops, is as follows : Take an ounce of the Peruvian balsam ; two 
ounces of the best liquid storax ; three ounces of gum Benjamin, 
impregnated with almonds ; and half fti ounce each of the best aloes, 
myrrh, frankincense, angelica roots, and the flowers of St. John's 
wort. Beat all these ingredients in a mortar, and put them into a 
liairge glass bottle ; adding a pint and a quarter of the best spirits 
of wine. Let the bottle stand by the kitchen fire, or in the chimney 
corner, two days and nights ; then decant it oflT, in small bottles well 
corked a6d sealed, to be kept ready for use. The same quantity 
of spirits of wine poured on the ingredients, well shaken up, and pla- 
ced near the fire, or in some other warm situation, about six or 
eight days and nights, will serve for slight occasions, on being 
bottled in a similar manner. 

Cephalic Snuff. 

Take half an ounce each of sage, rosemary, lilies of the valley, 
and the tops of sweet marjoram, with a drachra each of asarabacca 
^root, lavender flowers, and nutmeg. Reduce the whole composition 
to a fine powder ; and take it like common snufi*, as often as may be 
necessary for the relief of the head, &c. There, are many more pow- 
erful cephalic snufl*s, for particular medicinal purposes, but few so 
generally useful, agreeable, and innocent, to be used at pleasure*

lion not remarkably dry, so as tp crumble of iUM mta powdor. 

This is called air-slacked lime, m contradistinction to that wbicfa is 
•lacked in the usual way by being mixed with water. For the purpose 
of making the present usefid composition to preserve all aarte of 
wood work exposed to the vicissitudes of the weather^ take three 
parts of this air-slacked lime, two of wood ashes, and one of fine 
sand ; pass them through a fine sieve, and add as much linseed oil 
to the composition as will bring it to a proper consistence for workii^ 
with a painter's brush. As particular care must be takea to mix it 
perfectly, it should be ground on a stone slab with a proper mulJer, 
in the same manner as painters grind their white lead, &c. bu^ 
where these conveniences are not at hand, the ingredients maj be 
mixed in a large pan, and well beaten up with a wooden spatula. 
Two coats of this composition being necessary, the first maj be 
rather thin ; but the second should be as thick as it can conveniently 
be worked. This most excellent composition for preseirving wood 
when exposed to the injuries of the weather, is highly preferable to 
the customary method of laying on tar and ochre. It is, indeed, every 
way better calculated for the purpose, being totally impenetrable 
by water ; and, so far from being liable to injury by the action of the 
weather or heat of the sun, that the latter, though such a powerful 
enemy to tar and ochred palings, &c. even hardens, and conse- 
quently increases the durability of, the present proposed composition, 
which forms an article of public utility not only much cheaper than 
paint, but prodigiously more lasting. 

Art of making Bnllau^$ incomparable lAqmd for changing 
^ the Colour of the Hair^ fyc. 

This is said to be the best liquid in the world for making the hair 
curl, as well as for changing that which is disagreeably sandy to a 
very pleasing colour. The method of preparing it is as follows : 
Take two ounces of scrapings of lead, an ounce of hartshorn shav- 
ings, a quarter of an ounce of litharge of gold, and a drachm of 
camphor ; put them into a pint of soft water, and let them boil for 
half an hour. When cold and fine, pour the liquid off, and add to it 
a drachm each of the sugar of lead and rosemary flowers. Boi) these, 
up together ; pour off the liquid ; and, when fine, it is fit for im- 
mediate use. 

DiUeh Method of extracting beautiful Colours from Floufcrs, 
Leaves^ Hoots, fyc. 

Take the flowers, leaves, or roots, whatever quantity wished, and 
bruise them nearly to a pulp ; then, putting it into a glazed earthen 
vessel, pour filtered water suflicient to cover it, adding a table spoon- 
ful of a strong solution of pure pot-ash to every pint of water. After 
boiling, in a proper vessel, the whole over a moderate fire till the li- 
quor has obviously imbibed as much of the colour as can possibly 
be obtained from the pulp, decant the fluid part through a cloth or 
blotting paper, and gradually drop into it a solution of alum, which 
precipitates the colouring matter to the bottom. Having secured (he

powder, continue to wash it in several fresh waters, and, at length, 
filtering it again through blotting-paper, dry the remaining powder ; 
from which prepare the fin^t pigments, for water colours, by tritu- 
ration on marble, with clarified gum-water, and then form them into 
cakes, cones, &c. for sale. A fine violet colour is in this manner 
prepared by the Dutch from that flower ; the most delicately rosa- 
ceous red, from the small French rose and other beautiful red roses ; 
and a most brilliant azure, from the blossoms of the corn blue-bottle* 

Excellent Remedy for the Dropsy. 
TAKft sixteen large nutmegs, eleven spoonsful of broom ashes 
dried and burnt in an oven, an ounce and a half of bruised mustard- 
seed, and a handful of scraped horse-radish ; put the whole into a 
gallon of strong mountain wine, and let it stand three or four days. 
A gill, or half a pinl, according to the urgency of the disease and 
strength of the patient, is to be drank every morning fasting, taking >. 
nothing else for an hour or two afler. 

Another powerful Remedy for the Dropsy. 
Take. a suflicient quantity of pelitory of the wall, put it in pump 
water, and let it simmer over the fire till reduced to half* its quantity, 
then add honey to make it into a good syrup, of which take two-thirds 
to one-third of a glass of Geneva, two or three times in a day till re- 
lieved. This actually cured the Editor's mother, afler her legs had 
burst and "discharged water several times ; and the cure was so ef- 
fectual, that she never had that sad disorder aflerwards. 

Of the fining of Malt Liquors. 

It is most desirable to have beer fine of itself, which it seldom 
fails to do in due time, if rightly brewed and worked ; but as disap- 
pointments sometimes happen, it will be necessary to know what to 
do in such cases. 

Ivory shavings boiled in the wort, or hartshorn shavings put into 
l!he cask just before it is bunged down, will do much towards fining 
and keeping die liquor from growing stale* 

Isinglass is the most coipmon thing made use of in fining all sorts 
of liquors ; first beat it well with a hammer or mallet, and lay it in a 
pail, and then draw off about two gallons of the liquor, to be fined 
upon it, and let it soak two or three days ; and when it is sofl enough 
to mix with the liquor, take a whisk, and stir it about till it is all of ^ 
a ferment, and white froth : and frequently add the whites and shells 
of about a dozen eggs, which beat in with it, and put all together into 
the cask : then with a cfean mopstick, or some such thing, stir the 
whole together ; and then lay a cloth or piece of paper over the bung 
hole, till the ferment is over, and then bung it up close : in a few 
days it will fall fine. ^ 

But if it is wanted to fine only a small quantity, take half an ounce , 
of unslarked lime, and put it into a pint of water, and stir it well to- 
gether, and let it stand for two or three hours, or till the lime settle 
to the bottom ; then pour the water off clear, and throw away the sedi- 
iMttt t then tttke half an ounce of insinglaas cut small, and boil it m

To make Elderberry Beer, or EbtJum. 

Take a hogshead of the first and strong wort, and boil in the same 
one bushel of picked eiderberrieS) full ripe ; strain off, and when cold, 
work the liqUor in the hogshead, and not in any open tun or tub ; 
and, afler it has lain in the cask about a year, bottle it ; and it will be 
•a most rich drink, which they call l^bulum ; and has oflen been pre- 
ferred to port wine, for its pleasant taste and healthful quality. 

N. B. There is no occasion for the use of sugar in this operation; 
because the wort has strength and sweetness enough in itself to an- 
swer that end ; but there should be an infusion of hops added to the 
liquor, by way of preservation and relish. 

Some likewise hang a small bag of bruised, spices in the vessel 
White ebulura may be made with pale malt and white elderberries.

in water ; and, af\er dipping in tl)e bunches, and letting them get a 
little dry, rqli them in finely powdered loaf augai^. Lay them oo a 
sieve in a stove to dry ; and keep turning them, and adding sugar 
till they become perfectly dried. Not only red, white, and black 
currants, but even grapes in bunches, may be thus dried and pre- 
served. They should be carefully kept dry, in boxes neatly lined wiA 
paper. 

Dr. Stoughtoh*s celebrated Stomachic Elianr. 
Pare off the thin yellow rinds of six large Seville oranges, and 
put them in a quart bottle, with an ounce of gentian root scraped 
and sliced, and half a drachm of cochineal. Pour over these ingre- 
dients a pint of the best brandy ; shake the bottle well, several times, 
during that and the following day ; let it stand two days more to set- 
tle, and clear it off into bottles for use. Take one or two tea-spoons- 
ful morning and aflernoon in a glass of wine, or even in a cup of 
tea. This is an elegant but simple preparation, little differing from 
the compound tincture of gentian either of the London or Edinburgh 
Dispensatories ; the former adding half an ounce of canella altm, 
(white- cinnamon,) and the latter only substituting for the cochineal 
of Stoughton, half an ounce of husked and bruised seeds of the 
lesser cardamom. In deciding on their respective merits, it should 
seem, that Stoughton's elixir has the advantage in simplic5ity, and, 
perhaps, altogether as a general and elegant stomachic. Indeed, 
for some particular intentions, both the liondon and Edinburgh com- 
positions may have their respective claims to preference: in a 
cold stomach, the cardamom might be useful ; and, in a laxative ha- 
bit, the canella alba. As a family medicine, however, to be nt all 
times safely resorted to, there is no need to hesitate recommending 
Dr. Stoughton's elixir.

mud siA these articles ; then put tbc whdie into a quart bottle, and 
add half a pint of brandy, three ounces of white lily water, and the^ 
same quantity of pure spring water. Shake it well together, and 
keep it for use. With this Hquid, the face is to be freely and frequently 
bathed ; remembering always first to shake the bottle, and, on going 
to bed, lay all over the face linen which has been dipped in it. In 
ten or twelve days at farthest, it ip said a perfect cufe will be effected 
of this very unpleasant complaint, as nothing in this composition can 
possibly prove prejudiciah 

Curious^ method of separating Gold or Silver from Lace^ with* 
out burning it. 
Cut in pieces the gold or silver lace intended to be divested of 
any thing.but the pure metal ; tie it up tightly in linen, and boil it in 
soap ley, till the size appear considerably diminished : then take the 
cloth out of the liquid ; and, aAer repeatedly rinsing it in cold water, 
beat it well with a mallet, to extract all the alkaline particles. On 
opening the linen, to the great astonishment of those who have never 
before witnessed the process, the metallic part will be found pure and 
ijndiminished, in all its natural bri^tness, without a single thread. 

Permanent Red Ink for marking Linen. 

This useful preparation, which was contrived by the late learned 
and mgenious Dr. Smellie'of £dinburgh, who was originally a printer 
in that city, may be used either with types, a hair pencil, or even 
with a pen : take half an ounce of vermilion, and a drachm of salt 
of steel ; let them be finely levigated with Unseed oil, to the thick- 
ness or limpidity required for the occasion, ^fbis has not only a 
very good appearance ; but will, it is said, be found perfectly to re- 
sist the effectr of acids, as well as of all alkaline leys. It may be 
made of other colours, by substituting the proper articles instead of 
vermilion. *^ 

Portable Balls for taking out Spoisfronk Clothes. 

Spots of grease, &c. are in general easily removed from woollen- 
cloth of alt descriptions by means of portable balls prepared in the- 
following manner : Take fuller's earth, dried so as to crumble into 
powder, and moisten it well with lemon juice ; then add a small 
quantity of pure pulverised pearl-ashes, and work up the whole ifito 
a thick paste. Roll this paste into small balls, let them completely ' 
dry in the heat of the sun, and they are then fit for immediate use. 
The manner of using them is, by moistening with water the spots on ' 
the cloth, rubbing the ball over them, and leaving it to dry in the sun ; ' 
when, on washing the spots with common water, and oAen with 
brushing alone, the spots instantly disappear. 

Art of preparing a newly-discovered Permanent Green Pigment, . 
both for Oil and Water Colours. 

A ORBEiv colour, at once beautiful and durable, discovered by the 
ingenious M. Kinnman, member of the Swedish Academy. The pro- 
cess by which it is produ/»iMi ^^ ihiis descxih«»'i • Dissolve, in aqua

fortisi ft^ small quantity of ziacraoJ, in «^ua^cgiiiy nome strongly 
calciaed cobalt : each aolutioo to be .made ia a different wemaelky and 
to remain till the respective liquids he completely saturated. When 
they are both ready, mix one part of the former with two parts of 
the latter ; and, having prepared a hot and clarified soluikMi of pol- 
ash, pour in a quantity exactly equal to the whole of both Ihe other 
solutions, for the purpose »f precipitating the mixture. After it has 
subsided, the fluid part should be decanted, and the aedioient evapo- 
rated to dryness over the fire, till it assumes a green colour. It is 
necessary, however, that it should be repeatedly washed with filteied 
water, before it can be used ; but, this being efiected, it becomes fit 
for both oil and water colours, as it is sufficiently fixed to withstand 
all the eflects of the air and the sun ; which the inventor fully ascer- 
tained, by an experience of more than ten years. By meaos of this 
preparation, also the ingenious inventor adds, that painters noaj rea- 
dily combine their yellow and ultramarine, so as to form a most 
beautiful and permanent green. 

Stewed Oysters in French ftoU^^ 

Take any quantity of oysters, and wash them in their own liquor. 
Then,' straining it, put it in again with them, and add a little salt, 
ground pepper, beaten mace, and grated nutmeg. Let them stew 
a little together, and thicken them up with a great deal of butter. 
In the mean time, cut the tops off a few French rolls, and take out 
sufficient crumb to admit some of the oysters, ^hich must be filled 
in boiling hot, and set over a stove, or chafing-dish of coals, till they 
are quite hot through ; filling them up with more liquor, or 9ome hot 
gravy, as the former soaks in. When they are sufficiently moistened, 
serve them up in the manner of puddings. 

Dr. Anderson^s admirable Improvement on the common Mode 

of salting Butter. 

This ingenious gentleman, in his celebrated Recreations, first 
published the fpUowing directions for an improved mode of preserv- 
ing salt butter ; which he had experienced as not only more effec- 
tually to preserve it from any taint of rancidfty than the general old 
method of using common salt only, but also to make it look better, 
9La& taste sweeter, richer, and more marrowy, than if it had been 
cured with common salt alone. Take of the best common salt, two 
parts ; of saltpetre, one part ; and of sugar, one part ; beating tbera 
upjogether, so that they may be completely blended. To evefy pound 
of the butter add an ounce of this composition, mix it well in the 
mass, and close it up for use. Butter thus prepared will keep good 
fur three years, and caimot be distinguished from what has been re- 
cently salted. It may be necessary to remark, indeed, that butter cu- 
red in the above excellent manner, does not ta^te welHill it has stood 
nt least two or three weeks. Dr. Anderson is of opinion that such 
butter would keep during the longest voyages, if it could be so stow- 
ed as not to melt by heat of climate^ and thus oocasiM Jdia salts ta 
separate. 



MeihQdofetepeditwUily Fattening CMckens. 
Among the many silly prejudices which exist in England against 
the more general use of rice, is that of remarking its total un^tness, 
for feeding fowls. This may be true enough, if it be given them 
in so hard a state as to pass without dissolution ; but, perhaps, there 
is scarcely any thing which will sooner fatten the most delicate 
chickens than this very article, when it is properly prepared : Take, 
for (hat purpose, a quantity of rice, and grind or pound it int6 a fine 
flour ; mix sufficient for present use with milk and a little coarse 
sugar ; stir the whole well over the fire, till it makes a thick paste ; 
and feed the chickens, in the day-time only, by putting as much of 
it as they can eat, bi^t n'o more, into the troughs, belonging to their 
coops. It must be eaten while warm ; and, if they have also beer 
to drink, they will soon grow very fat. A mixture of oatmeal'and 
treacle, combined till it crumbles, is said to form a food for chickens, 
of which they are so fond, and with which they thrive so ^rapidly, 
that at the end of two months they become as large as the generality 
of full-grown fowls fed in the common way. 

Lord Orford^s euriotLs method of Feeding Carp in Ponds. 

Maye a gallon of barley meal, three pounds of chalk, and a suf- 
ficient quantity of fine clay, into a very stiff paste ; put it into a net, 
and place it so as to hang about a foot from the bottom of the water. 
When the carp have sucked away all but the clay, supply them wsth 
more made up in the same manner ; and, in three weeks or a monthi 
they will be found exceedingly fat. 

Dr, Fuller^ s Chemical Snuff for the Head-Ache^ Palsy, and 
Drowsy liistempersM 
MicDiciNAL snuffs, or errhines, are chiefly to be used in the morn- 
ing ; but, if needful, at any other time also. " They draw," Dr. 
Fuller observes, << out of the head and nose, Abundance of water, 
mucus, and viscid phlegm, and are pertinently prescribed against 
such illnesses of the head as are caused by tough clammy matter, 
and have been of 4ong continuance and contumacious ; such as 
gravative head-ache, palsy, and drowsy distempers." He^particu- 
larly recommends, for tbeae purposes, a snuff made in the follow** 
ing manner : Take half a scruple of tuibith mineral, half a drachni 
of powdered liquorice, a scruple of nutmeg, and two drops of oil of 
rosemary ; make them all into a ta& powder, and snuff up into the 
nose a very small quantity. This is so wonderfully powerful, that 
it brings off thin lympha as if it raised a salivation through the nose, 
so plentifully and streamingly, that no person could have imagined 
who had never seen its effects. He advises, therefore, that it should 
not be often repeated, without snuffing up ailer it a little warm milk 
or oil, to prevent any soreness by fretting the membrane of the 
nostrils.

receipt is takeo from a large and valuable collection that Sormeiij 
belonged to the family of the Earl of Shaftesbury ; and it is thereto 
asserted, that " a man, who had his thigh terribly bruised by tlie kick 
of a horse, was cured in a few hours, only by a poultice of the leaves of 
hyssop, dut or minced very small, aod beaten up with uRsalted butter. 
Culpepper in his herbal asserts the same lespectiog the virtues of 
hyssop. 

Stomach Plaster for a Cough,- 

Taks bees' wax, Burgundy pitch, and rosin, each an ounce ; melt 
them together in a clean pipkin, and then stir in three quarters of an 
ounce of common turpenline, and half an ounce of oil of nnace. 
Spread it on a piece of sheep's leather, grate some nutmeg over the 
whole plaster, and apply it quite warm to the region of the stomach. 

Oil of Brown Paper^ for Burnt. 

Take a piece of the thickest coarse brown paper, and dip it in the 
best salad oil ; then set the paper on the fire, and carefally preserve 
all the oil that drops for use. This is said to be an admirable remedy 
for all sorts of burns. Oil of writing paper, coMeCted in a similar man- 
lier, is often recommended for the tooth-ache. 

Liquid for removing Spots of Grease^ Pitch, or Oil, from 
Woollen Cloth, 

In a pint of spring water dissolve an ounce of pure pearl-ash ; 
adding, to the solution, a lefnon cut in small slices* This being pro-^ 
perly mixed, and kept in a warm state fpr two days, the whole must 
be strained, and the cle^r liquid kept in a bottle for use. A little of 
this liquid being poured on the stained part, is said instantaneously to 
remove all spots of grease, pitch, or oil; and the moment they disap- 
pear, the cloth is to be washed in clear water. 

Method of taking out Ink Spots from Woollen, lAnen^ and 

Silk, , 

To take spots ot mk out of wooWen, they must first be rubbed 
with a composition, consisting of the white of an egg, and a few 
drops of oil of vitriol, properly incorporated : next, immediately 
washed with' pure water ; and, lastly, have the parts smoothed, in the 
direction of the nap, with a piece of fiannel or white woollen cloth. 
From linen, ink spots may be removed, by immediately dropping 
plentifully on them, while wet with the ink, the tallow from a lighted 
candle, and letting it remain on a few days before washing the linen : 
this is also said to take the stains of red-port out of linen. Ink spots 
on silk require to be well rubbed with the ashes Of wormwood and 
strong distilled vinegar, and to. b^ at\erwards cleansed with soap- 
water. When ink is once dried on linen, the spot is to be taken out 
by rubbing it well with a piece of lemon, and then using a hot irov 
till the ink totally <ti8appear8. If a lemon be «* }n balf, the Knen 
where spotted pressed down over it till the juiet ^nMftrale» through.

Ink Stains taken out of Mahogany. 

Put a few drops of spirit of sea-salt, or oil of vitriol, in a tea- 
spoonful of water, and touch the stain or spot with a feat&er ; and^ 
on the ink disappearing, rub it over with a rag weFtted in cold water, 
or there will be a white mark not easily effaced. 

Red Mixture for giving a fine Colour to Mahogany Furniture* 

Stains of ink being first removed by the method above described, 
wash the tables or other mahogany furniture with vinegar, and then 
rub them all over with a red mixture made in the following manner : 
Put into a pint of cold-drawn linseed oil four pennyworth of alkanet 
root, and two pennyworth of rose-pink ; stir them well together in 
any earthen vessel, and let them remain all night, when the mixture, 
being again well stirred, will be immediately fit for use. When it 
has been left an hour on the furniture, it may be rubbed off till bright 
with linen cloths ; and will soon have a beautiful colour, as welf as 
a glossy appearance. 

Mr, Jayne^s Patent Method of preserving Eggs. 

Various have been the expedients by which good housewives, 
have endeavoured to preserve eggs. They have, in turns, been kept 
in salt, in flour, and in bran ; they have been scalded in hot water, 
and deposited at the bottom of a cold running stream ; they have 
been steeped in vinegar, and they have been bathed with oil. None 
of these expedients, however, seem to be universally approved, 
though each has had its respective advocates, and been warmly re- 
commended to attention. In the year 1791, a patent was obtained 
' by Mr. William Jayne, for his ne^ly-invented composition calculated 
to preserve eggs. The specification of Mr. Jayne, whose patent 
expired of course in the year 1805, directs ihat, for preparing his 
composition, a Winchester bushel of quick or unslacked lime, two 
pounds of common salt, and half a pound of cream of tartar, should 
be incorporated with such a quantity of common water as may re- 
duce the mixture to a state of consistence in which an egg will float 
with its top above the surface. In this liquid the eggs are to be 
constantly kept for use ; and the patentee asserts, that they will thus 
certainly be preserved perfectly sound for at least two years. 

Chinese Mode of rendering all Sorts of Cloth ^ and even Mus^ 
lin^ JVater-Proof 

By the following very simple process for making cloth water-proof,, it 
is asserted that the Chinese render not only all the strongest cloths hut 
even the most open muslins, implfenetrable to the heaviest showers 
of rain ; nor yet, as it is said, will this composition fill up the in- 
terstices of the finest lawn, or ih the slightest degree injure the 
most brilliant colours. The composition to which these valuable 
qoaliiied are imputed^ is merely a soluttonof half an oimce of white.

mixture, made with these materials, immerse the articles iatended 
to be rendered water-proof^ and then hang them in the open air tiU 
they become perfectly dry. .This is all the process necessary for 
accomplishing so desirable a purpose ; against which, however, 
Oiay be objected, perhaps, the expense, and unpleasant sceot, of 
the turpentine spirits : the latter objection may be remedied by 
using equal parts of spirits of wine and oil of wormwood, a mixture 
of which is said to dissipate the smell of turpentine ; but the former, 
it is not to be denied, mast necessarily be, nt the same time, in 
some degree, augmented. It has lately been attempted, m fioglaad, 
to render the u^e of water-proof cloth generaL 

Beautiful newly-dvicovered Golden Yellow Dye, for SUks^ 
Cotton^ fyc. 

This fine, lively, and durable yellow dye, has recently been* dis- 
covered by M. Lasteyrie, who thus describes the process by which 
it is obtained from the shaggy spunk, or boletus hirsutus of Linnseus; 
a species of mushroom, or fungus, growing chiefly on apple or wal- 
nut trees. This vegetable substance is replete with colouring mat- 
ter, which must be expressed by, pounding in a mortar ; after which 
the liquid thus acquired is to be boiled about a quarter of an hour. 
Six pints of water may^be well tinged for 3ying, by a single ounce 
of the expressed flufd. This being strained, the silk, cotton, &c. 
intended to be dyed, must be immersed and boiled in it for about 
fifteen or twenty minutes ; when fine silk, in particular, if it be after- 
wards passed through soft soap water, will appear of a bright golden 
yellow hue, equal in lustre to that of the silk hitherto imported from 
China, at a great expense, for imitating gold embroidery. In short, 
every sort of stufi* retains a fine yellow colour ; but it is, of course, 
less bright on linen and cotton. Nor is the use of this vegetable 
substance confined to dying ; since it has been ascertained that 
the yellow extract which it yields is applicable to the 'purposes of 
painting, both in oil and in water colours. 

Curious Method of Breeding an innumerable (Quantity of the 
beautiful Gold and Silver Fish. 

The curious process by which this is to be easily effected, may 
be in general applied, en a larger scale, to the breeding, in eqaai 
profusion, most of our esculent fresh- water fish. It is, simply, as 
follows : Get a large deep cistern or vat, of any dimensions, but one 
of about four feet diameter, and nearly the same height or depth, 
will very well answer the purpose ; then take a quantity of bireh, or 
small fiiggot wood, which has been previously soaked som^ time in 
a stream, spring, or porfd, so as to 'have lost a*!! power of discoioui^ 
ing or giving any farther taste to fresh water, and lay this wood aU 
along the bottom, to the thickness of about a foot, in some parts at 
leasty having large stones on the top to keep it from rising or motfiMi* 
])emg thus^ eertain that neither the vat nor the birch can )Bp<^ tli»

wufjUTi nfiwly fill it wilh the best soft water from -a river oi por>r, 
fiuch as there can be no doubt tbat tisb will be able to live in. 'i liti 
?at, it is to be observed, must be placed in the open air, but nut in a too 
cold or exposed situation ; and the breeding is to couinience in the 
%priag, when the fish are full, and just ready to spawn. Choose, aa 
breeders, four hard-roed or females, and only one soft-roed milc6er 
or male. Put the five, with all possible care not to hurt, them, into 
the vat ; feeding them occasionally, by throwing in a few crumbs of 
bread, or some other trifling food, but in no other way disturbing them, 
lyhen they appear quite tiiin, or shotten as it is termed, they must be 
quietly taken out with a small net, so as by no means to disturb the 
spawn, and entirely kept away ; as they would, if allowed to remain, 
(such is the nature of these and most other fish,)^ soon devour the 
greatest part of the spawn and small fry, suffering Httle or none ever 
to reach maturity. The vat must not be disturbed during the whole 
summer ; only, as the water decreases, a little fresh must from time 
to time be as gently as possible poured in, to supply the deficiency. 
In the course of the summer, the vivified roes will be hatched, and 
the water perceived swarming with a minute fry ; fully sufficient to 
stock a large piece of water, if not devoured by other fish, or the 
several birds which make fish their prey. By this m*ethod, myriads 
of those beautiful fish may be easily bred ; and, consequently, be- 
come very common. At present, it is true, though originally intro- 
duced from the East Indies, of which> as well as of China*, the gold 
fish, or cyprinus auratus of Lipnceus, is a native, it is still chiefly 
kept in glass globular vessels for ornament. It has, however, within 
these few years, been sufficiently ascertained, that these fishes 
thrive and propagate in ponds, or other reservoirs of water ; where, 
ttey are said to acquire a much larger growth, and come to greater 
perfection, than in the oriental countries. 

Syrup of Red Cabbage, as prepared in France, 

Cut and wash a large red cabbage, put it into .a pot covered with 
water, and let it simmer three or four hours over a moderate fire, till 
there only remains about a pint of liquor ; then strain it through a 
sieve, pressing the cabbage forcibly to get all the juice ; let the liquor 
stand fM>me hours tq settle, and pour off the clear. Put a pound of 
Narbonne honey into a saucepan, over a stove, with a glass of water ; 
and keep skimming it all the time it is boiling, till it be completely 
clarified. Then put in the cabbage juice, and make the whole boil 
to the consistence of a syrup ; which is always to be known, by ta- 
king a little of it on one finger, and finding that, on its being rubbed 
against the next, it forms a thread which does not instantly break. 
This syrup is regarded in France as a most excellent fortifier of the 
breast. It is umloubtedly a good, pectoral syrup, very pleasant, not 
at all expensive, aod easily made. A decoction of red cabbage, 
even in £ngland, by some eminent physicians, has been frequently 
recommended for softening acrimonious hun^^ours in disorders of the 
breast, and also in hotfrscness. 



S9 THkSkIV FAMilkl 

Bolu$€t for the liheuMatiam and CoTUractwm of ike J^inM^ 

Bruise four cloves of garlic with two drachms of gum ammoniw 
and make them into six boluses with spring water. Taiie one every 
morning and evening, drinking plentifully of sassafras tea, at least 
twipe a day, while using this medicine, 'this is ^aid' to be a most 
eifectual remedy for the rheumatism, and equally good in contractions 
of the joints. 

Pill for an Aching Hollow Tooth, 

Tak£ half a grain each of opium and yellow sub-sulphate of quick* 
silver, formerly called turpeth mineral ; make them into a pill, and 
place it ijB the hollow of the tooth some hours before bed^tinoe, viith 
a small piece of wax over the top, when it is said never to fail efiect- 
ing a complete cure. It was originally communicated, with many 
other medical receipts, by a learned physician at York. 

Ttafor the Gout. 
Take the leaves of carduus benedictus, or the holy thistle, with a 
sufficient proportion of angelica leaves to make it palatable, 6nt not 
much of either at a time, and drink half a pint of this infusion naade 
like common tea, rather weak, constantly every morning ibr twelve 
months. This is said to have alone relieved several persons who were 
ahnost crippled with the gout. The leaves of the blessed thistle, in 
strong decoction, are generally agreed to be beneficial where tl^re 
is a loss of appetite, or the stomach has been impaired by irregulari- 
ties ; and, whether an infusion be made in cold or warm water, it 
occasions, if drank freely, a copious perspiration, and greatly pro- 
motes the secretions. The dried leaf, which may be used for making 
the lea recommended,- loses much of that forbidding flavour always 
possessed by the fresh plant ; and which occasions it to be some- 
times employed in strong decoctions, either as an emetic, or as the 
auxilkiry of an emetic. 

Infallible Powder for Shortness of Breath. 

This excellent remedy for shortness of breath is particularly re- 
commended to young ladies. The powder is thus directed to be 
made : Take an ounce each of carraway seeds and anniseeds, half 
an ounce of liquorice, a large nutmeg, an ounce^ of prepared steel 
and two ounces of doublcs^refined sugar; reduce the whole into u 
very fine powder, and take as much as will He on a shilling every 
morning fasting, and the same quantity at five in the afternoon. It 
will be requisite to use exercise while takmg this medicine, which 
generally very soon effects a cure. Where any invincible prejudice 
against the use of steel exists in the mind, the medicine may be 
tried without it ; it will even then frequently afford relief. 

Excellent fVashfor Numbed or Trembling Hands 
Tabsk disagreeable complaints are said to be soon remedied by ' 
the very simple expedient of frequently washing the hands so affect*

strained, and used when cold. *

Mustard Whey^fora Palsy and Nervous Disorders. 

Turn half a pint of boiling milk, by putting in a table-spoonfui of 
made mustard. Strain the whey from the curd, thri^ugh a sieve, and 
drink it in bed. This will give a generous and glowing warmth, the 
whey thus conveying the mustard into the constitution. Dr. Stephen 
Hales says, that he knew a woman, who had a great degree of numb- 
ness ali over her, remarkably relieved with two doses only, and men- 
lions several instance^ where it has done gbod in nervous cases, and 
in palsy, greatly abating the malady and prolonging life. 

Ingenious French Vegetative Liquid for making Buttons Hoots 
flower beautifully in ornamental Glasses^ without Earthy du-* 
ring the Winter Season. 

Dissolve, gradually, in a glazed earthen or glass vessel, three 
ounces of saltpetre, one ounce of common salt, and half an ounce 
of salt of tartar, with a pint of rain water. When the solution is 
cdfnpleted, add half an ounee of loaf sugar ; filter the whole through 
a bag or blotting paper, and keep it bottled for use. Into each fiowe^r- 
glass, filled with rain or river water, are to be put eight or ten dropin 
of this liquid. The glasses must be kept constantly full, and tho 
water renewed every tenth or twelfth day at farthest ; to which must 
always be added the requisite number of drops of the vegetative li- 
quor. To ensure complete success, however, the glasses ought to 
stand on a mantle or chimney-piece where a fire is regularly kept in 
cold weather. The fibres of the roots must of course always im^ 
bibe the liquid ; and, with proper management, a fine succession of 
flowers may be kept up during the most rigorous seasons ; such as' 
crocuses of different colours, tulips, hyacinths^ snow-drops, &c. 

^rt qf Extracting the finest Carmine Powder from Clippings 
of Scarlet Cloth. 

That incomparable crimson colour, called carmine, which so 
beautifully participates in the most delicate tints of scarlet and of 
purple, is so very expensive, that miniature painters are often induced 
to substitute for carmine a composition of lake ; by the following pro- 
cess, howevsr, it is credibly asserted, that a better carmine may with 
certainty be manufactured than much of what is imported from France. 
Take five or six gallons of the purest water, and dissolve in • it a 
sufficient quantity of pot-ash to make a strong ley. After having 
filtered the solution, put it in a brass pot, and boil in it a pound of 
the clean shreds or clippings of the finest scarlet broad cloth dyed in 
grain, till they have entirely lost their colour ; then squeeze the sln^eds, 
and pass all the ley through a flannel bag. Dissolve two pounds of 
alum in a proper quantity of water, and add this solution to the ley ; 
stir them well together, and the whole will become rather thick* It 
is then to be repassed through the flannel bag, and the liquor will run 
out clear ; but, if it be at all tinged, it is agfiin to be boiled, with the 
addition of a small quantity of dissolved alum, and passed through

water is then to be poured repeatedly into the bag, till all ttie alum 
is washed away : after which the colour must be dried, so as to 
prevent any dust from settling on it ; and, being previously reduced

fit for use. 

Suhsiituie for Verdigrecut^ in producing a fine Black Dye 
toitkotU Injury to Clothe ^c. 

As verdigrease, though generally combined with logwood for 
dying black, is extremely apt to corrode the texture of the cloth, &c- 
the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and 
Commerce, in the Adelphi, rewarded Mr. Gle^g for his discovery of a 
substitute in dying that c6lour. For this purpose, equal parts of 
pot-ash, or any other strong alkaline salt, and vitriol of copper, are 
to be separately dissolved, and the two solutions gradually mixed. 
If the vitriol be sufficiently saturated, the water on the surface will 
become transparent on adding a few drops of the alkaline solution ; 
but, if not, it will produce a blue colour, so that no pot-ash should 
l)^ added till a complete saturation be ejected. These proportions 
of vitriol and alkaline salt will be equivalent to a similar quantity of 
verdigrease ; and, on being combined with decoctions of logwood, 
i:) tlie same manner as verdigrease, will impart a fine black dye, 
which is by no means prejudicial to the texture of cloth, hats, or 
other articles, so.often rotted by pernicious blaok dyes* 

Artificial Musk. 

The mode of making artificial musk, which is often used in Crer- 
many for th^t expensive odorous dnig, is simply as follows : Add, (o 
one drachm of oil of amber, by small portions at a time, four times 
the quantity of nitrous acid, commonly called aqua-fortis ; carefully 
stirring them together with a glass rod all the time, and continuing 
so to do till the whole berconverted into a yellow resin, possessuig 
the smell of musk in great perfection. It must, of course, be kept 
closely stopped up, like real musk ; and may sometimes supply the 
place of that high-priced article, not forgetting the nature of its chief 
ingredient. 

Wonderful but easy and effectual Method of rendering all Sorts 
of Paper Fire^Proof 

This astonishing effect is produced by a most simple process. 
It is only necessary, whether the paper be plain, written, or printed 
on, or even marbled, stained, on painted for hangings, to immerse it 
in a strong solution of alum- water, and then thoroughly dry it, when 
it will immediately become fire proof. This experiment is readily 
ascertained, by holding a slip of paper thus prepared over a candle. 
Some paper, however, will require to imbibe more of the solution 
tha!^ it may receive by a single immersion ; in which case, the 
operation of dipping and drying must be repeated till such paper be* 



BECEIfT-BOOK. • 25 

comeis fdHy saturated , when, it ia p<»siti?ely asserted, neither the co* 
loar tior quality of the paper will be in the smallest degree affected ; 
but that, on the contrary, both will be even improved. 

Bellamy's Patent Methods of making Lecher of all Sorts 
Water-Proof 

The patentee and inventor of these methods, Mr. John Bellamy, 
makes use of ^ two compositions ; which, according to his Fpecifica- 
tion in the Patent OfRce, registered 1794, are as follow : A gallon 
each of nut and poppy oils are to be mixed with three gallons of 
linseed oil ; or, one gallon of either nut or poppy oil may be added 
to three of that expressed from linseed ; or, two gallons of linseed 
oil may be combined with a pint of nut oil and the like quantity of 
poppy oil. These ingredients, either in the above proportions, or 
such others as may be required by the nature of the oils, being mix- 
ed in an iron pot, are to be placed over a gentle fire ; and to each 
gallon of oil must be added a pound of white copperas, sugar of lead, 
colcothar, or any other drying substance. When the whole has re- 
mained six or seven hours over such a degree of heat as it will bear 
without rising, till it become sufficiently dry, it is to be taken of]', 
and suffered to cool ; this first compound is then fit for use. Thp 
second compound, for the same purpose of rendering all kinds of 
leather water-proof, is thus directed to be made :* Take a pound of 
gum resin, half a pound of pitch, and a quarter of a pound each of 
tar and turpentine ; well mix these ingredients with one gallon of the 
oils prepared according to the first method, by gently heating the 
entire mass, and then increasing the fire till the whole be thoroughly 
incorpcH^ted. When the oils prepared according to the first method, 
or the gums according to the second, are sufficiently cool^ either is 
to be rubbed into the leather with a brush dipped in the respective 
composition ; and the thoroughly-impregnated leather being stretched 
on an even board, the superfluous matter is to be removed from its 
surface. Sole leather, and other thick substances, are to be first 
gently warmed : and, after being fully saturated with the composition, 
and properly dried in a warm place, they are ready for use. 

Genuine Receipt for making the Invaluable Cordial Liqttor 
called Vespetror^ recommended by the king of France^ s Physi- 
cians at Montpellier, 

This truly excellent and agreeable cordial, which comes thus 
sanctioned to the world, is recommended for all complaints in the 
stomach, indigestion, sickness, colic, obstructions, stitcl^es of the 
side, spasms in the breast, diseases of the kidneys, strangury, gra- 
vel, oppression of the spleen, loathing, vertigo, rheumatism, short-' 
ness of breath, &c.- The following are the genuine instructions for 
making it : Take a thick glass or stone bottle which will hold consider- 
ably more than two English quarts, and put in it two Paris pints, 
being equal to about two English quarts, of the best brandy ; adding 
the following seeds, first grossly pounded in a mortar ; two drachms 
cT angelica seeds, one ounce of coriander seeds, and a large pinch 



26 . TttE NEW rAllILT 

of pugil each offeonel seeds and aooiseeds. Tfaea squeeze io tbe 
juice of two fresh lemons, putting in also their rinds ; add a pound 
of loaf sugaj' ; and, well shaking the bottle from time to time, let the 
whole infuse five days. After this, to render the liquor clearer, pass 
it through a cotton 4ag, or filtering paper, and bottle it up, carefully 
and closely corked. To be taken, a small cordial glass at a time, 
more or less frequently, according to . circumstances. A table- 
spoonful taken four or five successive mornings, is said to kill the 
worms in children ; and, on rubbing with that small quantity the 
nose and temples fasting, it is a preservative of the person so using 
it against the ill effects of damp or unwholesome air. In short, this 
liquor will abundantly satisfy all who mayliave occasion to use it; 
and a gentleman having been long afflicted with an hepatic flux, 
which gave him continual torment, the use of this liquor carried it 
off, and completely cured him. 

Incomparable Method of Salting Meat^ as adopted by the late 
Empress of Russia, 

Thb following method of salting meat is asserted to have been 
used by the great empress Catharine, in her household establishment, 
with the utmost success : Boil together, over a gentle fire, six pounds 
of common salt, twQ pounds of powdered loaf sugar, three ounces of 
saltpetre, and three gallons of spring water. Carefully skim it while 
boiling ; and, when quite cold, pour it over the meat, every part of 
which must be covered with the brine. In this pickle, it is said, the 
meat will not only keep for maiiy months, but the hardest and 
toughest beef will thus be rendered as mellow and tender as the flesh 
of a young fowl ; while either beef, pork, or even mutton, will h^e 
a fine flavour imparted by it. In warm weather, however, the blood 
must be expressed from the meat, and the whole well rubbed over 
with fine salt, before it is immersed in the liquor. Young pork should 
not be left longer than three or four days in this pickle, as it will then 
be quite sufficiently soflened': but hams, intended for drying, may 
remain a fortnight before they are hung up ; when they should be 
rubbed with pollard, and closely covered with paper bags, to prevent 
their being Sy-blown. Though this pickle is, at first, somewhat 
more expensive than common brine, (as it may, be again used, on 
being boiled with additional water and the other ingredients,) it-is lar 
from being, on the whole, importantly more dear ; whilst it seems to 
promise advantages which most people would be happy to purchase 
at a much higher price.

•4W of making the best Black Ink Powder. 

Infuse a quarter of a pound of finely powdered nut galls in three 
pints of rain or river water ; exposing it, occasionally well stirred, 
toUa moderate degree of warmth for a few daji^, till the colouring 
matter seems fully extracted : then filter the solution into a vessel 
slightly covered^ and place it in the open air for several weeks : when, 
on removing the mouldy skin from the top, which has gradually been 
formed, it must be carefully collected, have hot water poured over 
it, undergo another filtration, and then be^ evaporated to dryness. 
Thus will be produced a gray crystalline salt, called the acid salt of 
galls, and which is the essential basis of black ink. On triturating 
a single drachm of this salt with an equal quantity of vitriol of iron, 
and about a pennyweight of the driest gum arabic, a composition 
will be obtained which affords an excellent black ink, merely on 
being dissolved in warm water. 

Genuine Syrup for Coughs^ Spitting of Blood, fyc 

This excellent , i:emedy for such frequently very alarming symp- 
toms, cannot be made too public. " He must,'' says the learned and 
liberal Dr. Fuller, " b*e a mere stranger in physic, who is not ac- 
quainted with this most noble syrup, and how mightily it succourd 
those who cough up blood." It is thus made : Take six ounces of 
comfrey roots, and twelve handsful of plantain leaves : cut and beat 
them well ; strain out the juice ; and, with|m equal weight of sugar, 
boil it up to a syrup. 

Vast advantages of Baking instead of Boiling Beet^Root, 

The beet-root too forcibly intrudes itself on the improved sagacity 
o/ mankind to be entirely neglected, as a source of cheap and sali^- 
t)rious food. The late Dr. Lettsom, some few years since, took 
uncommon pains to recommend a variety of one species of this 
genus, the German mangel-wurzel, or famine-root, under the ap- 
pellation of the root of scarcity, or large white beet-root, as an ar- 
ticle worthy of being universally cultivated. The time, however, 

, seems not yet arrived for the full value of even the more attractive 
red species to be generally known and duly appreciated { so that his 
philai^thropic design may be said to have hitherto failed. In speak- 
ing of the beet-root generally, the red beet-root, therefore, is to be 
considered as alone designated ; and we are about, to offer a few 
hints for bringing its modest and humble merits into a little more 
deserved estimation. The rich saccharine juice of the beet-root is, 
in a great degree, lost, and the root itself rendered, at once, less 
nutritious by the adventitious watery weakness which it is made to' 

. imbibe, as well as by parting with the native gelatinous syrup, of 
wjbich it is thus forcibly deprived. It is, therefore, most strongly 
recommended to adopt the mode of baking beet-roots, instead of 
boiling them, for general use ; when they will, unquestionably, be 
found to afford a very delicious and most wholesome food. This is 
not offered as an untried novelty : be^roots are universally baked'

Remedy for Wind in the Veins, 

This state of the veins, though always visible on the slightest in- 
apectioB, often escapes any notice, though it leads to many disorders. 
The following remedy may be taken with advantage whenever they 
appear in a suspicious state : Take equal quantities of powdered 
liquorice, carraway seeds, and sugar candy : to which add a third 
part of rhubarb, and the like quantity of cream of t$utar, both finely 
pulverized. Of this mixture*, take a tea-spoonful three or fbur tunes 
a day ; eitheV by itself, or in a glass of wine. It should be continued 
about a week ; and, being gently laxative, it cools the blood, eases 
pains, and relieves and prevents many disorders. 

Best Method of making Sage Cheese. 

Take the tops of youn^ rod sage; and, haying pressed the juice 
from them by beating in a mortar, do the sameVith the leaves ol'spia- 
age, and then mix the two juices together. After putting the reoaet 
to the milk, pour in some of this juice, regulating -the quantify by the 
degree of colour and taste it is intended to give the cheese. As 
the curd appeals, break it gently, and io «a equal manner ; thea, 
emptying it into a cheese vat, let it be a little pressed) in order to make 
it eat mellow. Having stood for about seven hours, salt and turn it 
daily Ibr four or five weeks, when it WiH be fit for the table. The 
spinage, besides improving the flavour and correcting the bitterness 
of the sage, will give it a much more pleasing colour than can be ob- 
tained from sage alone. 

Syrup of (xingtr. 

An agreeable and moderately aromatic syrup, impregnated with 
the flavour and medicinal virtues of ginger, is thus prepared : Ma- 
cerate an ounce and a half of beaten ginger in a quart of boiling 
water, closely covered up, for twenty-four hours : then, straining off 
the infusion, make it into a syrup, by adding at least two parts of 
fine loaf sugar, dissolved and boiled up in a hot water bath. 

Wonderful Power of the Turkish Glue^ or Armenian Ccfuent^ 
with the Art of making it. 

Tub jewellers in Turkey, who are mostly Armenians, aiccording 
to Mr. Eton, formerly a consul, and author of the Survey of the 
Turkish Empire, have a singular method of ornamenting wateh- 
CAses, &c. with diamonds and other precious stones, by simply glu- 
ing or cementing them. The stone is set in silver or gold, and the 
other part of the metal made flat to correspond with the part to which 
it is to be flxed ; it is then warmed gently, and has the glue applied, 
which is so very strong, that the parts cemented never separate. This

gfucf,* which wifl strongly unite bits of glass, and even polished steel, 
and may of course be applied to a vast variety of useful purposes, 
is thus tnade : Dissolve five or six bits of guifl mastrcb, each the 
size of a large pea, in as much spirits of wine as will sufBce to ren* 
der it liquid : and, in another vessel, dissolve as much isinglass, pre- 
viously a little swelled or softened in water, though none of the 
water must be used, in French brandy or good rusa, as will make a 
two-ounce phial of very strong glue : adding two small bits of gum 
galbanum, or ^mmoniacum, which must be rubbed or ground till 
they are dissolved. Then mix the whole with a sufficient heat. 
Keep the glue in a phial stopped close, and, when it is to be used, 
set the bottle in hot or boiling water. Mr. £ton observes, that some 
persons have, in £ngland, prepared and sold this composition under 
the name of Armenian Cement ; but it is much too thin^ and the 
quantity of mastich in it too ^mall : it must, this gentleman adds, be 
like strong carpenters' glue. This certainly is one of the rhost 
valuable known cements m the world. Nor is it at all improbable, 
that a plan, said to have been invented in France or Germany, for 
making up^ clothes, &e. by uniting cloth without sewing, in some at- 
tempt founded on the use of this very cement ; with what ultimate 
success, we must leave time to develope. In the mean while, there 
MWa be no sort of doubt, that much may be effected by ingenious 
apphcations of 80 powerful an agent. 

ValvbcAh Sicret in preparing Foil for Diamonds, and other 
precious Stents^' as used- by the Armenian Jewellers. 

The method of preparing the rich foils in which the Armenian 
jewellers set precious stones, particularly diamonds, to much advan- 
tage, and which, under roses or half-brilliants, is n^st remarkably 
beautiful, and not subject to tarnish, is generally kept as a great se- 
cret ; and such foils, Mr. Eton assures us, sells at Constantinople 
for from half to three-quarters of a dollar each. The mode of pre- 
paring them is extremely simple. An agate is cut, and highly po- 
lished, of the shape desired ; a cavity of about its own siee is nejct 
formed in a block of lead, and over this cavity is placed a bit of tin*, 
the thickness of strong brown paper, scraped' very bright. The 
agate is then placed on the tin, over the cavity, and struck with a 
mallet ; when the beautiful polish which the tin instantly receives, is 
scarcely to be imagined by those who have never seen it. 

Easy method of Dying Cotton with Madder ^ as practised at 

Smyrna. 

Cotton, at Smyrna, Mr. Eton tells us, is dyed with madder in 
the following manner : The cotton is boiled in com rfton olive oil, 
and then in mild alkali ; being thus cleaned, it will take the mad- 
der dye : and this is the fine colour so greatly admired in Smyrna 
ootton-yarn. " I have heard," adds this gentleman, " that the sum 
of five thousand pounds was given in England for this secret !" It is, 
doubtless, a secret in preparing cottons, and perhaps other articles, 
for the reception of a particular dye, very well worth knowing

Celebrated French Worm Medicine for Dogs. 

This medicine has the reputation of efiectually killing and ex- 
pelling the worms with which dogs are oflen so grievously tor- 
mented, and which, probably, may be one grand cause of their 
running mad. It is thus made : Take, for one dose, which generally 
proves sufficient, two drachms each of juice of wormwood, aloes, 
and staves-acre^ the two last powdered as small as possible ; with 
one drachm each of pounded burnt hartshorn and sulphur. Mix 
the whole together in nut oil^ to the quantity of about half a glass, 
which must be given to the dog for a dose* If at all necessary, 
another dose may be given a day or two after. 

Superior Use of the celebrated German Tinder^ and great Im- 
portance of its being universally adopted. 

On the continent of Europe, every traveller, sportsman, &c. car- 
ries constantly this tinder about him, which is conveniently portable, 
and resembles a piece of soft and very thick tanned leather, of elas- 
tic substance, and a sort of velvet surface on the upper part. It is, 
in fact, a large fungus, commonly calicfd punk, which grows at the 
roots of old trees, where it st)reads to a considerable size. This 
substance is dressed, I:ammered, and otherwise manufactured for 
the purpose, into this appearance, and, being dried, forms the true 
German tinder at all times ready for use, and far less liable to be- 
come damp than English tinder. The manner of using it is by 
tearing off a small bit, which will serve several times, and holding it 
at the edge of the flint, which is smote by the steel, instead of the 
steel by the flint. In this the Germans are so expert, and can so 
well rely on their tinder, that they will engage to light it at a single 
stroke, and, indeed, seldom fail to do so. The tinder being thus 
kindled, may be placed in a pipe of tobacco, or extinguished in- 
stantly between the finger and thumb, after lighting a match for this 
or any other purpose. It is always kept in a pouch or box, with a 
flint, steel, and short German matches ; and few persons are much 
from home without carrying them constantly in their pockets. If the 
German tinder were to be manufactured in England, many poor 
persons might be employed in collecting the punk, which is now 
suffered to rot without utility ; and, could it be brought entirely to 
prevent the destruction of rags for tinder, a quantity far exceeding 
what may be generally imagined, it might prove the meiOis of greatly 
assisting the manufacture of paper.

Turkish Method of Filtering Water by Ascension* 

The process is this : They fnake two w^lls, from five to (en feet, 
or any other depth, at a small distance from each other, with a com- 
munication between the two at their bottoms. The separation is of 
clay well beaten, or other substances impenetrable by water. Both 
wells are then filled with sand and gravel. The opening of the well 
^nto which the water to be filtered runs, is made somewhat higher 
vthan that into which it is to ascend ; nor does the sand of this latter 
approach the brim, where there is either sufficient room left for all 
the filtered water, or it is drawn ofl^ by a spout run into a vessel 
placed for that purpose. The greater the difference is between the 
height of the two wells, the faster the water filters ; but the less 4t is, 
the better it operates, provided a sufficient quantity of water be sup- 
plied by it for the intended purpose. This, Mr. Eton observes, may 
be practised in a cask, tub, jar, or other vessel, and would be use- 
ful on board of ships : the water being conveyed to the bottom by a 
pipe, and the lower end having in it a sponge, or the pipe might he 
filled with coarse sand. It is evident, that all such particles as, by 
their gravity, are carried down in filtration by descent, will not rise~ 
with the water in filtration by ascension. From this account, it 
should seem, that the principle of filtration by ascent, considered 
as anew discovery by some ingenious Europeans, has been -long 
known to the Turks. 

Mr. Peacock* s Patent Machine for Purifying and Filtering the 
foulest water. 

The utiUty of filtering machines, , in the different processes of 
brewing, distillery, and dying, as well as that of making bread, and 
all other domestic arts, is sufficiently obvious. The filtering ma- 
chine of Mr. Peacock has been contrived and composed with a com- 
bination of skill and simphcity which is seldom witnessed. The 
turbid fluid is poured into a vessel, with layers of sifted gravel or 
small pebbles, in different gradations of size, at the botton, and con- 
nected somewhat like the Turkish filtering wells, with a similar 
vessel, with like sjrata or layers, in progressive degrees of fineness, 
through which the water, however foul, on its entrance into the first 
vessel, now rises clear and pure in this. Had Mr. Peacock, who is 
one of the first architects in the world, been a poor or a mercenary 
man, this invention mirht have obtained him a large fortune : .but, 
beicig neither one nor the other, though this gentleman secured his 
right by patent, and he was only solicitous of its being adopted 
from philanthropic motives, and hxs probably lost more money 



32 THS NEW fAXILT 

than be has gained by the invcDtioo. Wheo iU vm% beeone* duif 
appreciaiedy soine future maoufacturer of Mr. Peacock's fiiteriag 
machines may probably reap the advantage. A apecimen of bia 
machine is deposited in Guildhall, London, and, though capable of 
yielding a constant and pure stream of three buodjred gallons in 
twenty-four hours, it does not occupy more room than a comoMm 
large drip or filtering stone, with all its accompanying apparatus: 
that nothing may be wanting to its perfection, it is easily -cleansed, 
though seldom necessary, in the short space of a single minute. 
Nothing, therefore, is easier than for brewers, distillers, dyers, & c 
who are so inclined, to have all their water filtered by means of Mr. 
Peacock's invention, which is capable of being extended to any 
magnitude, at an expense which cannot be the smallest object to 
the generality of persons concerned in those respective manufac- 
tories. This invention, could it be brought into general use, might 
be considered as a blessing to the nation. At sea, if the strata may be 
so fixed as not to be too much disturbed or deranged by the shp's 
motion, which seems very possible, the use of such a machine must 
be so great, that no vessel ought to sail without one* A little char- 
coal, from its antiseptic quality, might- perhaps be introduced with 
advantage among the stiata of gravel. The want of filtered water 
gives rise to more nephritic complaints than is imagined* 

^ Management of Coffee in France. 

Those who wish to have excellent coffee, in France, roast it eveiy 
day as it is used : they even say, that it should be roasted, ground, 
infused, and drunk, in the space of two hours ; and assert tbat, if 
these processes be longer in succeeding each other, thecofice loses 
much of that volatile spirit which constitutes all its agreeable flavour 
The quantity commonly used is an ounce to five cups of spnng wa- 
ter, to produce four of good and clear coffee. In the mean time, it is 
usual to throw their coffee grouixls into a vessel, boil them half an 
hour, and leave them to settle : this infusion so well serves for a 
third part of the cofiee in powder, that in a cofiee-pot of fourteen 
cups of pure spring water, which should have three ounces to be 
good, two ounces with this infusion will be of equal strength and good- 
ness. The operation of boiling the grounds is performed, in large 
coffee-houses, five or six times every day. 'IMiis is the common 
way of making coffee throughout France, where it is generally drank 
with sugar and cream ; while, at difierent coffee-houses, and in par- 
ticular families, vanilla, isinglass, and other ingredients, are also in- 
troduced, as they have lately been in England. The French, beside 
breakfasting often on coffee, usually drink two cups about half an 
hour after dinner, to hasten digestion, or abate the fumes of wine 
and liqueurs when they have been taken to exceed the bounds of ne- 
cessity. I 

mill invaluable, thovgh cleanly and easily made Mixture^ for 
effectually destroying those noisome V^ermin Bugs. 

Mix half a pint of spirits of turpentine and half a pint of beat 



iifiefe]]^T-]ioo&; 33 

rectified spirits of tirine ia a strong bottle, and add In small pieces 
about half an otmceof camphire, which will dissolve in a fow minutes. 
■ Shake the mixture well together ; and, with a sponge or brush dip- 
ped in it, well wet the bed arid fiirniture where (he vermin breed. 
This will infaltiblj destroy both them and their nits, though they 
swarm. The dust, however, should be well brushed from the bed- 
stead and furniture, to prevent, from such carelessness, any stain. 
If that precaution is attended to, there will be no danger of soiling 
the richest silk or damask. 

On touching a live bug with only the tip of a pin put into the mix- 
ture, the insect will be instantly deprived of existence, and "should 
any bugs happen to appear after using the mixture, it will only be 
from not wetting the linen, &c. of the bed ; the foldings or Hnings 
of the curtains near the rings or the joints, or holes in and about the 
bed or head-board, in which places the vermin nestle s^nd breed ; so 
that those parts being well wetted with more of the fixture, which 
dries as fast as it is used, and pouring it into the joints and holes, 
where the sponge, and brush cannot reach, it will never fail totally 
to destroy them. 

The smell of this mixture, though powerful, is extremely whole- 
some, and to mariy persons very agreeable. It exhales, however, in 
two or three days. 

Only one caution is necessary ; ^ut that is important. The mix- 
ture must be well shaken whea used ; but never applied by candle- 
light, lest the spirits, being attracted by the flare of the candle, might 
cause a conflagration. 

Grand Ptisan, or Diet Drink of Health and Longevity , by a

for a fortnight, three times a year, before winter, toward Easter, and 
diiring the greatest heats of summer, lived to the age of nearly an 
hundred and twenty years. This ptisan is pronounced useful to all 
sorts of persons : if they are ill, to cure them ; if well, to preserve 
them in health. It is even good for infants ; and, above all, excel- 
lent for old people. An infinitude of facts attest its wonderful ef^ 
fects. It is thiis directed to be prepared : Take about a quart of the 
best-sif\ed and well-washed oats, and a small handful of wild succory 
roots newly drawn out of the earth ; boil them gently in six quarts 
of river water for three-quarters of an hour, and then add half an 
ounce of crystal mineral, and three or four spoonsful of the best 
honey, or a quarter of a pound of it in weight. Let the whole now 
boil half an hour longer; then strain, it through linen, put the liquid 
.n^n earthen vessel, and leate it covered to cool. For persons of a 
bilious habit, only half the quantity of honey should be used, as the 
sweetness has a tendency to increase the bile. Two good glasses 
of this ptisan should be drank every morning fasting, without eating 
any thing for )9ome hours ; and the same quantity three hours after

should comcnence with some previous purgative ; after which thia

and pleasant in its operations ; not occasioning any griping pains or 
other disagreeable sensations : at the same time, it perfectly cfeansea 
the reins, is very diuretic, greatly promotes expectoration ; purges 
the brain ; cleanses the lungs, the liver, and the spleen ; expels pit- 
trid and malignant humours, all pain from the head, gravel, and evea 
stone when newly formed ; cures tertian and quartan agues, Jiow-* 
ever inveterate ; all colics and pleurisies ; the itch, blotohea, and 
other foul eruptions ; and, in short, every kind of heaviness, lassi- 
tude, and general debility. It rouses the senses, clears the eighty 
excites appetite, and gives rest and sleep. It refreshes, feeds, and 
conveys perfect health ; and even seems still sensibly operating, 
and doing good, for a month or two after it has ]i)een taken« It is, 
beside all this, very nourishing. Instead of weakening, as is the 
case with the greater part of other remedies, it absolutely strengthens: 
and, during the dog-days and greatest heats of summer, when medi- 
cines in general are subject to become dangerous, and even fatal, 
tiiid is in fact more salutary than at any other season. It might, in- 
dited, be taken every day without doing the smallest injury ; (he 
party taking caqe, during intensely cold weather, to keep constantly 
warm. To attain long life, it will perhaps be sufficient to take it for 
a fortnight once or twice in the year ; if once only, during the great 
heats, as the best season for its use. This panegyric^ however 
great, is translated almost verbatim from a most respectably Fnnch 
author. It is undoubtedly an excellent medicine.

Art ofmgking Pho^horic Tapers or Matches, 

In a tubular piece of glass four inches long, and a single Unti

phorus ; and pushing it to the extremity, introduce a taper covered 
slightly with wax, to fill up the rest of the tube, vi^Mch must be her* 
metically sealed ; when plunging the other end into boiiing water, 
the phosphorus melts, and adheres to the taper or match. A line 
is usually marked on the glass with a flint, at about one*4hird the 
length of the tube, where it is to be broken when the taper is wanted 
for use ; which being then briskly iirawii out, wifl be found complete- 
ly lighted by the phosphorus* 

Easy Meihod 4}f prepisrimg Phosphonc Battles. 

Heat a common glass phial, by fixing it in a ladleful of sand ; 
then, putting in two or three minute bits of phosphorus,* stir them 
about with a piece of red-hot iron wire, till the phosphorus is aH 
spread over and adheres to the internal surface of the bottle, where 
it will form a reddish coating. When, by repeated introductions of 
the heated wire, this is completely effected, the bottle is to reipain 
open a quarter of an hour, and then be corked for use. One end of 
a common match beins put into a bottle thus prepared, on touching 
the phosphorus, and being suddenly drawn out, will be with certainty 
lighted. As there can be no particular danger of accidental fire 
from the use of these bottles; and, with reasonable care in using 
them, and keeping them closely stopped, a single bottle would last 
a considerable time, and might, were the demand general, be replen- 
ished. at a most trifling expense : it may, possibly, in the hands of 
some ingenious and enterprising person, be finally made to super- 
aede the tindei^box, that dreadful^onsurner of rags, and consequent 
onemy^tO'the manufacture of paper. Phosphorus is one of those

SfecifieaiUm ffJj$pd fWiUmmJUmrritft Fa^kmififr ^mir^ctimg 
S4areh from HwTMt Che9uut$. 

Thk patent for tbts useful invention and discovery is dated March 
8, 1796 ; of course the exclusive privilege of extracting starch from 
horse chesnuts in the following manner was confined to the patentee 
till the expiration of fourteen years. We shall present our curious 
readers with the mode of preparing this starch in his lordship's own 
words, extracted from the specification in the Patent Office : '* I first 
take the horse chesnuts out of the outward green prieklj bnsks ; 
and then, either hj hand, with a knife or other tool, or else with a 
mill adapted for that purpose, I very carefuNy pare off the brown 
rind : being particular not to leave the smallest speck, and to entirely 
eradicate the sprout or growth. I next thke the nuts, and rasp, grate, 
•r grind, them fine into water : either by hand, or by a mill adapted 
for that purpose. The pulp, which is thereby formed in that water, 
I wash as clean as possible through a coarse hair sieve ; and then, 
again, through a still finer ; constantly adding clean water, to pre- 
vent any starch from adhering to the pulp. The last process is, to 
put it, with a large quantity of water, about four gallons to a pound 
of starch, through a fine gauze, muslin, or lawn, so as entirely to 
clear it o[ all bran, or other impurities. As soon as it settles, I pour 
off the water, and then mix it up widi clean ; repeating this operalion 
till it no longer imparts any green, • yellow, or other colour, to the 
water. I then <il rain it off, till nearly dry ; and set it to bake, either 
in the usual mode of baking starch, or else spread out before a brisk 
fire ; being very attentive to stir iC frequently, to prevent its homing ; 
that is to say, turning to a paste or jelly, which, on being dried, turns 
hard like horn. The whole proce^ should be conducted as quick 
as possible. The utility of this invention requires no comment. 
Should it come into general use, not only a vast consumption of 
wheat flour must be saved ; but, Ifrom the necessity of planting more 
chesnut tr^es, for the sake of a fruit hitherto considered as of no 
sort of value, much of that excellent and beautiful wood will be pro- 
duced for the many purposes to which it is applicable. 

Patent Potato Composition to be used instead of Yeast. 

For this ingenious contrivance, which introduces potatos as a 
sort of leaven for making wheaten bread, a patent was obtained by 
the inventor, Mr. Richard Tillyer Blunt, in the year 1787 ; which, 
of course, is now expired. The following is the process for this 
purpose, as described by Mr. Blunt in his specification : To make 
a yeast gallon of this composition, such yea^t gallon containing 
eight beer quarts, boil in common water eight pounds of potatos 
as for eating; bruise them perfectly smooth ; and mix with them 
while warm, two ounces of honey, or any other sweet, and one beer 
quart of common yeast For niaking bread, mix thnse beer pints 
of the above composition with a bushel of flour, using warn^ water

* Britannic Etoitic €htm^ 

For the invention of this curious and useful composition, a patent 
was obtained, in the year 1781, by Mr. Albert Angel :' who describes 
it, in his specification, as being very serviceable and useful in the 
severakbranches of portrait and house painting, by making the co- 
lours durable and free from peeling ; as of great utility in gilding, 
painting, penciling, and staining of silks, calicos, &c, and in dress- 
ing silk, linen, and cotton, in Uae loom, instead of gum or paste, 
so as to strengthen the threads of the finest cottons ; as excellent 
for beautifying and fixing the colours on paper, equal to that done 
in India ; as of the greatest use for rendering the clay, or composi- 
tion, used in modeling, sufficiently supple, and prQ^eating iia dryii^g 
too fast ; and, lastly, not less efiectual in causing a trans^rency of 
colours fit for china and earthen ware, so as to stand baking or burn- 
ing. This Britannic gum is stated to be prepared in the following 
very simple manner : Put into an iron kettle, and melt down to- 
gether, till the mixture become this compositioii or elastic gum, a 
gallon of linseed or nut oil, a pound of yellow or bleached bees* 
wax, six pounds of glue or size, a quarter of a pound of verdigreasCf 
a quarter of a pound of litharge, aid two quarts of spring or rain 
water.

wormwood. Infuse the whole in two quarts of brandy^ rum, or 
Madeira wine ; and, aAer it has stood some time, pour bfl* what ia 
clear, and add to the ingredients a quart more of either liquor, though 
brandy is considered as best for the purpose. This, too, havijsig re*- 
oaained a somewhat longer time, and been occasionally shaken, m«|r 
be in like manner poured ofiTfor use. Two tea'rspooasful,_oc some- 
what less, are directed to be taken, an hour before dinner, «ii half m

The Honourable Mr, Charles Hamilton^$ Method of making 
Orape Wines, fully equal to Champaign and Old Uock^from 
the jFruit of his beautiful Vineyard at Pain's HiU, in Surry, 
England, 

Thk vineyard belonging to Pain's HiH, one of the finest coantij 
residences in the united kingdom, is situated on the seuth side dL 
a gentle hill, the soil being gravelly sand. It is planted entirely wicS 
two sorts' of Burgundy grapes : the Avemat, which is the most de- 
licate and tender ; add the miller's grape, originally so named £roit 
the powdered whiteness on the leaves in the spring, called in Eng- 
land the Black cluster or Burgundy grape. We shall give, in t£s 
Honourable Mr. Hamilton''s own words, his valuable account of the 
process pursued, and its successful effect : ^< The first year I attempt- 
ed to make wine in the usual way, by treading the grapes ; then let- 
ting them ferment in the vat till all the husks and impurities formed 
a thick crust at the top, the boiling ceased, and the clear wine was 
drawn oflT from the bottom. This essay did hot answer. The wine 
was so very harsh and austere, that I despaired of ever making red 
wine fit to drink ; but, through that harshness, I perceived a flavour 
something like that of small French white wines, which made me 
hope I sbouFd succeed better with white wine. That experiment 
succeeded far beyond my most sanguine expectations, for, the very 
first year I made white wine, ft nearly resembled the flavour of 
Champaign ; and, in two or three years more, as the wine grew stron- 
^r, to xs^ great amazement, my wine had a finer fiavour than the 
best Champaign I ever tasted. The first running was as clear as 
spirits ; the second running was'oeilde per drix, or partridge-eye co- 
lour \ and both sparkled and creamed in the glass like ChampaiorD. 
It would be endless to mention how many good judges <^ wine were 
^ deceived by my wine, and thought it superior to any Champaign they, 
had ever drank. Even the Duke de Mirepoix preferred it to any 
other wine. But, such is the prejudice of some people against any ' 
thing of English growth, I generally found it most prudent not to de 
clare where it grew tiU after they passed their vevdici <»a si.. Tha

surest proof I can give of its excellence is, that I have sold it to wine 
merchants for fiAy guineas a hogshead ; ai)d one wine merchant, to 
whom I sold five hundred pounds worth at one time, assured me he 
sold some of the best of it from seven shillings and sixpence to ten 
shillings per bottle. After many years experience, the best method 
r found of managing it was this : I let the grapes hang, till they had 
got all the maturity the season would give them ; then they were 
carefully cut off with scissors, and brought home to the wine barn 
in small quantities to prevent tlieir breaking or pressing one another. 
Then, they were all picked off the stalks, and all the mouldering or 
green ones discarded, before they were committed to the press ; 
where they were'ttll pressed in a few hours after they were gathered. 
Much would run from them, bef<!»re the press squeezed them, from 
their own weight on one another. This running was as clear as 
water, and as sweet as syrup ; and all of the first pressing, and part 
of the secQBd, continued white : the other pressings grew reddish, 
and were not mixed with the best. As fast as the juice run from the 
press into a large receiver, it was put into the hogsheads, and closely 
banged up. In a few hours, one would hear the fermentation begin ; 
which would soon burst the casks, if not guarded again by hooping 
them strongly with iroii, and securing them in strong wooden 
frames, and the heads with wedges. In the height of the fermen- 
tation, I have frequently seen the wine oozing through the pores of 
the ^taves. These hogsheads were left all the depth of winter 
in the cold barn, to have ;the benefit of the frost. When the fermen* 
tation was over, which was easily discovered by Ihe cessation of the 
noise and oozing, (but, to be more certain, the pegging the cask 
showed when it would be quite clear,) then it was racked off into 
clean hogsheads, and carried to the vaults, before any warmth of 
weather could raise a second fermentation. In March the^hogsheads 
were examined. If they were not quite fine, they were fined down 
with common fish glue- or isinglass, in the usual manner; those 
which were fine of themselves were not fined down. All were bot- 
tled about the end of March ; and, in about six Weeks more, would 
be in perfect order for drinking, and would be in their prime for above 
one year : but, the second year, the flavour would abate ^ and Mrould 
gradually decline, till it lost all flavour and sweetness. Some, 
that I kept sixteen years, became so like Old Hock, that it nfight 
pass for such to one who was not a perfect connoisseur. * The only 
art I ever used to it was, patting three pounds of white sugar-candy 
to some of the hogsheads, when the wine was first tunned from the ' 
press ; in order to conform to a rage that prevailed, to drink none bat ' 
very sweet Champaign." In the astonishing success of this pro- 
cess, we see demonstrated how little assistance from art is required 
by nature, provided that little be judiciously applied.

BlaikieU Patent Substitute for Gum^ in thidcening Colcmrs 
for Calico Print^rs^ ^c. 

This useful article is thus described by Mr. Francis Bfanfcie of 
Glasgow, the patentee, in his specification : The gum substitute, 
to thtcken colours for linen and calico printing, and making np or 
furnishing printers' colour tubs, and wluch may also be appKed to 
several other uses, is prepared by boiling any quantity of AEuc-seed 
in a sufficient quantity of water, till the whole substance be extract- 
ed ; and, having strained it through a linen or woollen cloth, agfun 
boiling down the liquor to (he consistence of a jelly. This is to be 
kept in a close vessel ; and, for preservation, to have a little strong 
spirits put in, or some sweet oil poured on the top. It might, how- 
ever, be preserved with bitters: The printer, in using this substitute, 
may either put a certain quantity into a gaHon of colour, according 
to the nature of it, and the particular kind of work to be done, and 
regulate himself by trial, as is common in using gum, or reduce the 
substitute by boiling it in water to the consistence that may be foiuid

lady has thy6#h on the process of dying Morocco leather in ge-

after those particular but inferior objects, which yet remain undis-

Purified Sj/rup cf Molassta. 
In many parts of the contkient of Europe, a method iias for some 
vears been successfully practised, on m large scale, of divesling mo- 
lasses, vplgarly called treacle, of its peculiar maivkish and unplea- , 
sant taste, so as to reader it, for many purposes, little less useful 
^ and pleasant than sugar. Indeed, unless it be for cordials mixed 
with spices, or in domestic dishes where mHk is an ingredient, it may 
very generally be substituted for sugar. The process for thus pre- 
paring it is sufficiently simple, and by no means expensive : Boil 
twelve pounds of molasses, with three pounds af coarsely- pounded 
charcoal, in six quarts of water, over a slow fife. AAer the mixture 
has-been, stirred together, and simmered for at least half an. hour, 
decant it into a deep vessel ; and,, when the charcoal has subsided, 
pour off the liquid, and again place it over the fire, that the super- 
fluous water may evaporate, and restore the syrup to about its ori- 
ginal consistence. Thus refined, it will produce twelve pounds of a 
mild and good syrup, proper for use in many articles of food, &c. 



i ^rt of preparing « foie Red Lake from Dutch Madder., 

' The use of madder, ia dying a fine red colour, and also as a first 

' tint for several other shades, has long rendered it famous among 

dyers i and, by the following process, it will af!brd a permanent lako 

of a fine red, appheable to every purpose of painting : Dissolve two 

' ounces of the purest alum m three quarts of distilled water previously 

i> boiled in a clean glased vessel, and again set over the fire. With- 

I draw the solution as soon as it begins to simmer, and add to it two 

I ounces of the best Dutch madder; then, boiling it up once or twice, 

remove it from the fire, and filter it through clean white paper. Let 

the liquor thus filtered stand -all night to subside ; and, next day, 

pour the clear fluid into the glazed vessel, heat it over the fire, and 

gradually add a strained solution of salt of tartar, till the madder bo 

<vholly precipitated. The mixture must now be again filtered, and 

^oiling distilled water be poured on the red powder till the fiuid no ' 

*onger obtains a saline taste. Nothing more is now necessary, but 

^ dry the lake^ which will be of a deep red colour. If two parts of 

madder be used to one of alum, the shade will be still deeper ; and, 

if one pait of the latter article he added to four parte of the former, H 

beautiful rose colour will be p)o<l*t«^ed.

T^ Etffereud Mr. Oartwrigkt^s Account of ihe Wonierfid 
Efficacy of Yccut in the Curt of Putrid Diseases. 
The following account of the Reverend Mr. Cartwright's first 
discovery, and subsequent e3q>erieace, of the good efiects of ad- 
ministering yeast in putrid sore throats, fevers, &c. cannot be too 
generally made known : — " Several years ago," says this gentleman^ 
for we shall transcribe verbatim his own highly interesting narrative, 

, ^ I went to reside at Brampton, a very populous village near Ches- 
terfield. I had not beeti there many months before a putrid fever broke 
out among us ; aqd, finding by far the greater number of my new 
parishioners much too poor to afford themselves medical assistance, 
I undertook, by the help of such books on the subject of medicine 
as were tn ray possession, to prescribe for them. I eariy attended a 
boy about fourteen years of age, who was attacked by this fever ; he 
had not been ill many days, before the symptoms were unequivocally 
putrid. I then administered bark, wine, and such other remedies as 
my books directed. My exertions, however, were of no avail : his 

. disorder grew every day more untractable and malignant, so that T^ 
was m hourly e]q>ectation of his dissolution. Being under the abso- 
lute necessity of taking a journey, before I«et off I went to see him, 
as I thought for the last time ; and I prepared h(s parents for the 
event of his death, which I considered as inevitable ; reconciling 
them, in the best manner I was able, to a loss which I knew they ' 
would feel severely. While I was in <;onversaiiou op this distressing 
subject with his mother, I observed, in a corner of the rooln, a small 
tub of wort working. The sight brought to my recollection an ex- 
periment I had somewhere met with, of a piece of putrid meat 
being made sweet by suspending it over a tub of wort in the act of 
fermentation. The idea instantly flashed into my mind, that th<s 
yeast might correct the putrid nature of this disease : and I instantly 
gave him two large spoonsful, telling the mother, if she fbupd her 
son better, to repeat this dose every three hours. I then set out on 
my journey. On my return, after a few days, I anxiously inquired 
about the boy, and was informed he had recovered. I could not re- 
press my curiosity. Though I was greatly fatigued with my journey, 
and night was come on, I went directly to where he lived ; which ^ 
was three miles off, in a wild part of the moors. The boy himself 
opened the door ; looked surprisingly well ; and told me, that he' 
felt better from the instant he took the yeast. After I left Brampton, 
I lived in Leicestershire ; and, my parishioners being there few and 
opulent, I dropped entirely my medical character, and would not . 
even prescribe for any of my own family. One of mj domestics 
falling ill, accordingly the apothecary was sent for. The ^^rvant*s 
Icomplaint was a violent fever ; which, in its progress, became putrid. 
Having great reliance, and deservedly, on the apothecary*s penetra- ; 
tion and judgment, the man was left solely to his management: ;His 
disorder^ however, kept daily gaining ground: till, at length, the * 
apothecary considered him in very great danger. At last, finding 
every effort to be of service to him baffled, he told me, he eonsi-' * 
iered it as a lost case ; for, in his opimon, the man couid dot survive'

basin of sago, with a good deal of lemoa w^ie^ end ginger in^ it, and 
he ate it with appetite. In another, hour, I reflated the jreast ; an 
hour e^erward, I gare hiip the bark ; and, the next hpuc, he had 
food. He had) next, another dose of yeast ; and then went to bed, 
being nine o'clook. I v^at to him next morning, at.si^L o'clook ; when

tim m the last stage Qf a putrid fever ; his tongue was black i hia 
pulse was scarcely pei;cepilible ; and he ley strotQbed out,, like a 
corpse, in a state of drowsy inseoalbility. f imniediatfsiy procured 
some yeast; which I diluted with wateUt e^nd poured down hia throat. 
I then left him, with little hope of his. rec^ery. I returned to him^ 
m about two hours ; and found him sensible, and able to oQiwerse. 
1 then gave him sr dose of bark. He afterward took^^ at a proper, 
interval, some pelreshment, I cpntiaued with him till he repe9led the 
yeast ; and then l^ft him, with directiops how to proc^^d* I called 
on him the next morning at nine o'clock, and found hina apparently

AdmirMe Cemmt^ or MoniOTiM made on the Cot$wold BilUn 

*Oif the Cots wold Hills, in Gloucestershire, where lime is dear, and 
sand not to be had, an excellent mortar is prepared at a moderate 
price. Invention is seldom more- successful thati when it is prompted 
by necessity. The scrapings of the public roads over these' hills, 
being levigated lime-stone, more or less impregnated with the dung 
and urine of the animals travelling on them, are found to be a most 
admirable hasis ibr cement. The scrapings are* oAen used 'for ordi«' 
*nary walls ; and the general proportion, for even the best biiildings, is 
not more than one part lime to three of scrapings. Tbjs mortar, of less 
than ten years standing, has been observed to possess a stohe-Iike 
tenacity, much fitmef then the cbttimon stone of the cottntrf : 'and, 
consequently, much harder than the stones from which eitlier- thto 
basis or the lime was made. The method of preparing this powerfhi - 
mortar, or cement, is simply by eollecting the road 0crapingii, riidt«

Jincient British Liquor^ ccdled BraggtL 

This oeee famous oM British liquor is still made by a few respee* 
table lamiies, chiefly in Wales ; from one of which we have besa 
favoored with an admirable method of preparing it. The ^cn-igiail 
Welsh name ia btagod ; from which has been formed that of hragget, 
or bragget, for it is found both ways in the few old dictioiiariee and 
other books where it occurs, and sim|riy defined as a dmk, consist- 
ing of honey and spices. Were this correct, itxionid only he con- 
sidered as the W^sh appellation of mead or metheglin ; but, accord- 
ing to oar information, bragget implies a combination of oaalt Hqasr 
with honey and spices, the best method of preparing which is as fol- 
lows : Take after the mte of a gallon of water to a pound of honey, 
and stir it till the honey be melted. Then, adding half a bamtfbl 
each of rosemary tops, bay-leaves, sweet briar, angelica, baha, 
thyme, or other sweet herbs, with half an ounce of sliced ginger, 
and a little nutmeg, mace, cinnamon, and a few cloves^ boil them 
gently together for nearly half an hour ; scumming it well, till it looks 
tolerably clear. In the mean time, having prepared three gallons of 
the first runnings of strong ale, or sweet wort, mix the two liquids quits 
hot, with all the herbs and spices ; and, stirring them together for 
some time over a fire, but without suffering them to boil, sitaia off 
the liquor, and set it to cooL When it becomes only the warmth <^ 
new milk, ferment it with good ale yeast ; and, after it has properiy 
worked, tun it up, and hang a bag of bruised spices in the barrel, 
where it is to remain all the time of drawing. It is generally drank 
from the cask ; but may be bottled, like othet liquors, any time after 
it has entirely ceased to hiss in the barrel. A weaker sort of brag- 
get is sometimes prepared with the third runnings of the ale, a smal- 
ler proportion of honey, and the strained spices, &c. with a few fresh 
herbs ; the second runnings, in that case, being made the family ale. 
These arrangements, however, and other obvious deviations, are 
made according to tbe taste or inclination of the respective parties.

RCGEIFT-BOOK. _ ^. 

TransfletioDB of that year it is thus regularly described : Take raw 

potatoes, Id the state they are taken out of the earth. Wash them 
well : then rub them on a grater, over a vessel of clean water, to i 
fine pulp ; pass the liquid matter, through a coarse sieve, into anothei 
tub of clear water ; let the mixture stand, till the fine white par 
tides of the potatoes are precipitated ; then pour the niticilaginous 
liquor from the fecula, and preserve this liquor for use. The article 
to be cleaned should be laid, on a linen cloth, on a table : and, having 
provided a clean sponge, dip the sponge in the potato liquor, and 
apply the sponge thus wet on the article to be cleaned ; and rub it 
well on with repeated portions of the potato liquor, till the dirt is 
perfectly separafed. Then wash the article ia ctoan watar several 
ttoMd, to remove the loose dirt. It may, afterward, be smaolliedo 
dried. Two middle sized potatoes will be aafBciant fof a piai of 
water. The white fecula, which separates in making the mucilagi- 
nous liquor, will answer the purpose of tapioca : it will make a use«> 
fal and nourishing food with soup or milk, or serve to make starch 
and hair powder. The coarse pulp, which does not p^ss the sieve, 
is of great use in cleaning worsted cuKains, tapestry, carpets, or 
other coarse goods* The mucilaginous liquor of the potatoes will 
clean all sorts of silk, cotton, or woollen goods, without damaging 
the texture of the article or spoiling the colour. It is also useful in 
cleaning oil paintings, or furniture that is soiled. Dirty painted 
* wainscots may be cleaned by wetting a sponge in the liquor, then 
dipping it in a little fine clean sand, and afterward rubbing the wains- 
cot therewith. Various experiments were made by Mrs. Morris, in 
the presence of a committee, at the society's house ; and the whole 
process, on fine and coarse goods of different fabrics, was perform- 
ed to their entire satisfaction. This simple but very valuable dis- 
covery majr certainly be applied to many other useful purposes, as 
well as those which are here particularly enumerated. 

JVw method of Clearing Feathers from their Animal Oil. 

The process for efiecting this useful purpose, is thus described in 
the Transactions of the Adelpbi Society, who rewarded Mrs. Rich- 
ardson with a premium of twenty guineas for making the discovery : 
Take for every gallon of clear water, a pound of quick lime. Mix 
them well together ; and, when the undissolved lime is precipitated 
in fine powder, pour off the clear lime-water for use, at the time it is 
wanted. Put the feathers to be cleaned in another t^b, and add to 
them a sufficient quantity of the clear lime-water to cover the fea- 
thers about three inches when well immersed and stirred therein. The 
feathers, when thoroughly moistened, wilt sink dovitn ; and should re<^. 
mala in the lime-water three or lour days : aller which, the foul liquor 
should be separated from the feathers, by laying them on a sieve* The 
feathers should be afterward well washed in dlean water, and dried 
on nets, the meshes being about the same firmness as those of cab- 
bage nets. The feathers must, from time to time, be shaken on iha 
nets ; aad, as they dry, they will fall through the me^ies^ and are to 
ha eQllected for use. The^ admission of air will ba serviceable in tba 



do THE NEW rAMlLT ^ 

drying, and the whole process maybe completed in about three weeks* 
The fathers, af^er being thus prepared, will want nothing more 'than 
beating for use, either as beds, bolsters, pillows, or cushions. So 
effectual is this method, and so preferable to the old and common 
way of stoving or baking, that an eminent dealer having sent to the 
society some bags of foreign feathers, which retained their unplea- 
sant smell after having been stoved the usual period of three days, 
Mrs. Richardson rendered them perfectly sweet and clean. ' This is 
a very important discovery ; more particularly as the feathers, by not 
being hardened with heat, certainly require less beating. 

Mr. Seba$tian GrandVi Restoration «r Discovery of the M 
Venetian Art of frefaring Grounds for Painting on Pan- 
ndsy Copper^ or Canvas^ fyj 

This ingenious gentleman, having long had the honour of being 
employed by the most eminent professors of the fine arts in Italy 
and England, and assisted and improved the processes of preparing 
canvases and the pannels, seems to have discovered, as far as ex- 
perience can prove, the manner of preparing either canvas, copper, 
or pannel, in the old Venetian stile ; an art which has been long lost, 
and to which it is well known that Titian, Paul Yeronese, Bassani, 
and other Yenetian masters, owed much of the peculiar harmony, 
brightness, and durability, of their beautiful productions. Mr. Grandi, 
having communicated, for the public benefit, his entire process of 
thus preparing pannels, canvas, &c. for artists ; and also made 
other valuable communications with regard to the preparation of oils, 
colours, crayons, &c. for painting and drawing ; was rewarded fay 
the Honourable Society in the Adelphi for the encouragement of 
Arts, &c. with their elegant and honourary silver medal, as well as 
a pecuniary premium of twenty guineas. These, therefore, in per- 
fect concert with the design of that liberal and truly patriotic institu- 
tion, we shall contribute all in our power to make more generally 
known. Mr. Grandi's method of preparing pannels and canvases 
for painters is thus described : Break, grossly, the bones of sheep's 
trotters, and boil them in water till they are cleared from their grease , 
then putting them into a crucible, calcine them, and afterward grind 
them to powder. Dry some wheaten fiour in a pan, over a ^ow fire ; 
then make it into a thin paste, adding an equal quantity of the pul- 
verized bone ashes, and grind the whole mass well together. This 
mixture forms the ground for the pannel. When the pannel has been 
well pumiced, some of the mixture or ground is to be well rubbed 
on a pumice stone, that it may be incorporated with the pannel : 
another coat of the composition is next applied, with a brush on the 
pannel, where it is suffered to dry, the surface being afterward rubbed 
over with sand paper. A thin coat of the composition is then ap- 
plied with a brush ; and, if a coloured ground be required, a coat or 
two more must be added, so as to complete the absorbent grouiid.

eotoufs sbpald also be mixed vp'v^ith tbe (mrified. oU for painting

a tbin coat of the composition, and afterward drying and pumicing 
them ; then giving them a second coat, and, lastly, a coat of colour- 
ing matter along with the composition. The grounds thus prepared 
do not crack : they may be painted in a very short time afler being 
laid ; and, from their absorbent quality, allow tbe business to be pro- 
ceeded in with greater facility and better effect than with those pre- 
pared in the usual mode. These valuable qualities have been suf- 
ficiently ascertained, and are liberally avowed, by Sir William Beechy 
and other Royal Academicians, whose names are added to Mr.

Method of Purifying the Oil for piixin^ up Colours^ 

Macb some of the bone-ashes into paste wifh a Httle water, so as 
to form a mass or ball. Put this ball into the fire, and make it red 
hot; then immerse it, for an hour, in a quantity of raw linseed oil 
sufficient to cover it. ^When cold, pour the oil into bottles ; add to 
it a little of the bone-ashes ; let it stand to settle ; and^ in a single 
.da^Ty it will be clear, and fit for use. 

Preparation of White^ Broum^ Yellow^ Red, Gray, and Blue 
Black Colour^, which never Change, and may be used either ^ 
. . in Oil or Waier. 

WfiiTE Ts'made by calcining the. bones of sheep's trotters in a 
eleaf open fire, till they become a perfect white, which will never 
change. Brown is made from bones in a sitnilar manner, only cal- 
cining from them in a crucible instead of an open fire. Yellow, or 
masticot, by burning a piece of soil brick of ayellowisbcolour in the 
fire ; grinding a quarter of a pound of flake white with every .pound 
of^rick : calcining them, as well as grinding them^ together ; and, 
afterward, washing the mixture to separate the $and, and letting the 
finer part gradually dry for use. Red, equal in beauty to Indian red, 
by calcining some of tbe pyrites usually found in coal pits.. Gray, 
by calcining together blue slate and bone ashes powdered, grinding 
them toother, washing the texture, and gradually drying it. Blub 
Black, hf burning vine stalks within a clo^e' crucible and in a sloW 
fire, till^ey become a perfect charcoal, which must be well ground 
for use. 

Superior Crayons, of Permanent Colours^ to be applied either 
in Water or OiL 

These crayons, produced also by Mr. Grandi, are of a qualit^ 
superior to any heretofore in use ; they are fixed, so as to prevent 
their nibbing off the paper when used, and may be applied in water or 
oil. This process of preparing the crayons is thus described : — ^They 
arelnade of bone-ash powder mixed with spermaceti, adding the co- 
louring matters. The proper proportion is, three ounces of sperma- 
ceti to a pound of the powder ; the spermaceti to be first dissolved^ 
ia a pint of boiling water; then the white bone-ashes added ; andttu^f

Preparation of JjFhite and Coloured Chalks. 

If white chalk be required to work aofl^ add a quarter of a pound 
of whiting to a pound of the bone-«sh powder; otherwieo^ the 
bone-asbee will answer alone. Coloured chalks are prepared bj 
grinding the respective colouriag matters with bone-^sbes. These 
jieveml communications^ relative to the preparation ef groundSf oi, 
colours, crayons, and chalks, for painters, were moat xespectahty 
certified to the Society in the Adelphi, by 3ir Wiliiam Beechy, and 
the following other Royal Academicians, &c. Benjamin West, John 
^ Opie, Martin Archer Shee, James Northcote, Xhonaa Imwrence, 
Joseph Farrington, Richard Oosway, P.* J. Se Iioutherhourg, Rich- 
ard M. Pay^y aud Isaac Pocock, J^^quires ; who all coofirm the 
good qualities of the pannels prepared hy Mr. GiaAdi, and f^enecally 
recommend his colours as useful and permanent. The owtesMtte 
are certainly extremely cheap, as well as easy to be proc^irod* and 
none of the processes for 'preparation are at all difficult. 

Syrvp of Danmsk Mo$€i. 

The Edinburgh Dispensatory describes syrup of (iamask roses as 
an agreeable and mild purgative for children, in dos^s of from half 
to a whole table spoonfuL It likewise mentions, that this syrbp 
proves gently laxative to adults ; and, with that intentiooi may be of 
service to costive habits. The method of preparing it^ according to 
the London practice, is as follows : — Take seven ounces of the dried 
petals of the damask rose, six pounds of double-reined sugar, and 
four pints of boiling distilled water. Macerate the roses in the wa- 
ter for twelve hours^ and then strain. Cvaporata the strained liquor 
to two pints and a half; and add the sugar, that it may be made a 
syrup. In the Edinburgh practice, it is prepared thus :— ^Take one 
])ound of'the fresh petals of the damask rose, four pounds of boiling 
Water, and three pounds of double* refined ^ugar« Ma^eyrate the 
i;bses in the water for twelve hours ; then, to the strained infusion, 
add the sugar, and boil them to a sy^un in the usual naanoeT) as di- 
rected for syrup of clove-gillyflowers, &c. 

. ^Sjimp^MadHoHs. 

This, in the Edinburgh SispenSBtoi^, is properly distinguished 
(irom the.^yrup Q.f damask roses y being- considered as mildly astrin- 
gent, instead of gently laxative.. It ^eem^i however, prmcipaliy 
valued on account of its beautiful red. colour. The manner of pre- 
paring it is almost the same as the London meihod'of making the 
syrup of damask roses, called simply syrup of roses :— Take seven 
ounces of the dried petals of red roses, six pounds of double-refined 
sugar, and five pounds of boiling water. Macerate the roses in the 
prater for twelve hours ; then beil a littlci and strain the liquor ; add

in a clean earthen vessel, oyer a gentle fire ; aiui. when fluid, add- 
ing one third its weight of pure poppy oil, stir the wliole weH to- 
gether. These things bdnff in readiness, place over a finune or 
support the stone on which me colours were ground, with a charcoal 
fire to warm it beneath. This done, grind the colour fine wi&a 
muller, on the warm stone ; afler which, adding a suffident qoantitj 
of the mixture of poppy oil and spermaceti, work the whole to- 
gether with a muller to the proper consistence. Lastly, takings 
piece of the fit size for the cake intended to be made, roll it into a 
baU, put it into a mould and press it, when the process will be coa- 
plete. These cakes, on being wanted for use, must be rubbed dova 
m poppy or other oil, or in a mixture of spirits of tMrpentine aaioil, 
as may best suit the convenience or intention of the aitiaft. 

A curtails and us&ftd Gluti* 

Take an ounce of isuiglass» beat it jto sfansd% and pat it inlss 
pint of brandy ; when gnidually dissolved, wiuch it soon m wilhs 
gentle heat, strain the solution through a piece of fine avwdiay aari 
the glue will be obtained, which is to be kept in a glass cleaely atop 
ped. On being dissolved, in a moderate beat, it is thin, :tnuispaiea^ 
and aln^ost limpid. When used in the smnner of oommoo glue, il 
joins together the parts of ifood stronger than the wood kself ii 
united : so that the pieces thus joined will break in any o&er ^ait 
sooner than where they are glued together , It is also reaaaitsabl^ 
that, if saw-dust, or powdered wood, be made into a baM with this 
glue, the ball will prove solid and elastic ; so that it may be tmiiMd 
and used as a bowl, without breaking. As the g^ue thus made wMi 
brandy will keep long without corrupting, it is by no means an ia^ 
proper form to preserve ismglass ceady disisolved, for fining awes 
. and other purposes. Another use of thui usurious ghie i% that of lAs 
serving excellently for taldng off impressions of medab or eoia&i 
thus, if a little of it, when melted, b^ poured thinly oa anew gmneai 
&c. so as to cover the whole surface of the piece, an(i sufiaied so to 
remain a day or two, till it become thoroughly dry^ it will .appear haid 
and transparent, like a piece of Muscovy glass, with the impresaioa 
of the guinea in intaglio, as it is denominated, on one side, and in 
relievo on the oihen This giae dries into a nrety atraagi too^ and 
transparent substance ; not et^sily damaged by ^ny thing but.equeous 
ihotsture, which would soon dissolve it. This last reason renders it 
tinfit for any use where it would be much exposed to wet or damp 
air. Comijnon glue, dissolved with linseed oil, is admirably calcu- 
lated to stand the weather ; a secret little known by those who would 
be most benefited by its adoption.

appear perfectly bright It may, probably, require to be three or 
four times strained, according to the fineness or coarseness of the 
sugar, and other circumstances. When quite clear, this charming 
liquor is immediately fit to drink ; or will keep, if bottled, any length 
of time, and in all climates. 

Art of making the Curious Sympathetic Ink* 

This, curious ink has been long known in the worid ; butthemfib* 
ner of preparing it, and means of proouHng the niateriab, as describe 
ed in various chemical books, rendered the task too discouraging to 
be oflen attempted* By the following easy method, however, it is 
readily accomplishable : — ^Taka an ounce and a half of zaffre, which 
may be obtained at any colour-shop, and put it into a glass vessel- 
with a narrow and long neck, pouring over it an oonoe m^isure of 
strongnitrous acid, dUuted with five times the quantity of water. 
Keep it in a warm situation, but not too hot, for about ton or twelve 
hours, and then decant the deaiiest part of the liquor^ Having so 
done, pour nearly as much more diluted nitnNis acid on the remain^ 
der : which is to continue in the same iiituation, and for as long a time 
as before, and then b^ decanted and nuxod with what was obtained 
by the first operation. This being done, dissolve in it two ouncen of 
common salt, and the sympathetie ink is compbtely made* Tho 
property of this ink is, that the writing made witii it, on common pa«* 
per, is legible only while the paper is hoi and dry ; so that, by ex* 
posing it, alternately, to the ambient air, and to the heat of a fire or 
burning sun, whatever is written may be tiaused to. appear and dis- 
appear at pleasure. The universal knowledge of this secret rather 
diminishes than increases the security of guilt in using it for any im* 
proper purpose; since detection is certain, from the moment suspicion 
takes plaoe, by simply holding every letter or other doubtful paper to 
«he fire, or in the warm rays of the sun. 

Spfi Swling WaXyfor Impreamg Seals of Office^ ^c. 

This sealing wax, which is seldom used for any other purpose 
than that of receiving the impressions of seals of office to charters, 
patents, proceedings in chancery, &c. is prepared, when to be used 
white, or rather uncoloured, by mixing half a pound of bees' wax, an 
oance and a half of turpentine, and half an ounce of sweet oil ; and 
carefully boiling them together, till the compound becomes of a fit 
consistency for moulding idto rolls, cakes, or balls, for use. If colour 
be wanted, it is readily obtained by stirring into the melted mass 
about half an ounce of a proper pigment, as in making the red or 
other coloured hard sealing wax.

bt«ftg<»hole, and place it in a situation where ii may best receive the 
heat of the sun. Make it in March, or the beginning of April, and 
it will be fit for use in July or August. If not sour eaoiigh, which 
can seldom happen' when properly managed, let it stand a month 
longer before it be bottled iolT* It may be Icept in stone or glass bot-

' This sugar vinegar^ though very strong, may be tised in picklmg for

SsnigtiJar and nrnple manner of preserving Apples from the 
effkcts df frost in J^orth America. 

Applss being proiduced .aln^ost abundantly in North America, 
and forming an article of chief necessity jn almost every family, the 
greatest care . is constantly taken to protect them from frost at , 
. the earliest commencement of the winter reason ; it being well 
known, that tipples, if left unprotected, are inevitably destroyed by 
tbe first frost which occurs. This desirable object, during their 
long and severe^ winters, is said to be completely effected, by only 
throwing over them a thin Jinen clotli before the approach of frost, 
iprben the fruit is never injured, how severe soever the winter may 
happen to prove. Tet apples are there , usually kept in a small 
apartment, immediately beneatli the roof of the house, which is par-* 
ticularly appropriated to that purpose, and where there is never any 
fire. This is a fact so well known, that the Americans are astonish- 
ed it should appe^ at all wonderful : and they have some reason to 
be 60, when it is considered that, throughout Germany, the same 
method of preserving fruit is universally practised^ from whence 
probably it made its way to North America. It appears that linen 
cloth only is used for this purpose ; woollen cloth, in particular, 
having been experienced to prove inefiectual. There seems abun- 
dant reason to believe, that even potatoes might be protected from 
frost by some such simple expedient. This, also, like the preced- 
ing article, to which the principle seems so very analogous, merits 
high consideration ; and for the same important reason, its capa* 
bility of conducing to the universal benefit of mankind, and the nu- 
merous animals under our protection. ,

IS 



Method ofempedkiounly Fattening Chickens. 
Among the many silly prejudices which exist in England against 
the more general use of rice, is that of remarking its total unfitness, 
for feeding fowls. This may be true enough, if it be given them 
in so hard a state as to pass without dissolution ; but, perhaps, there 
!8 scarcely any thing which will sooner fatten the most delicate 
chickens than this very article, when it is properly prepared : Take, 
for that purpose, a quantity of rice, and grind or pound it int6 a fine 
fiour ; mix sufficient for present use with milk and a little coarse 
sugar ; stir the whole well over the fire, till it makes a thick paste ; 
and feed the chickens, in the day-time only, by putting as much of 
it as they can eat, biu rib more, into the troughs, belonging to their 
coops. It must be eaten while warm ; and, if they have also beer 
to drink, they will soon grow very fat. A mixture of oatmealiemd 
treacle, combined till it crumbles, is said to form a food for chickens, 
of which they are so fond, and with which they thrive so ^rapidly, 
that at the end of two months they become as large as the generality 
of full-grown fowla fed in the common way. 

Lord Oifqrd^s curious method €f Feeding Carp in Ponds. 

Maice a gallon of barley meal, three pounds of chalk, and a suf- 
ficient quantity of fine clay, into a very stiff paste ; put it into a net, 
and place it so as to hang about a foot from the bottom of the water. 
When the carp have sucked away all but the clay, supply them wstli 
more made up in the same manner ; and, in three weeks or a mocth, 
they will be found exceedingly fat, 

Dr, ISiller^s Chemical Snuff for the Head- Ache^ Palsy ^ and 
Drowsy Distempers^ 

MicDiciNAL snuffs, or errhines, are chiefly to be used in the morn- 
ing ; but, if needful, at any other time also. " They draw," Dr. 
Fuller observes, << out of the head and nose, Sundance of water, 
mucus, and viscid phlegm, and are pertinently prescribed against 
such illnesses of the head as are caused by tough clammy matter, 
and have been of 4ong continuance and contumacious ; such as 
gravative head-ache, palsy, and drowsy distempers." He^particu- 
larly recommends, for the^e purposes, a snuff made in the follow^* 
ing manner : Take half a scruple of turbith mineral, half a drachni 
of powdered liquorice, a scruple of nutmeg, and two drops of oil of 
rosemary ; make them all into a fine powder, and snuff up into the 
nose a very small quantity. This is so wonderfully powerful, that 
it brings off thin lympha as if it r^sed a salivation through the nose, 
so plentifully and streamtngly, that no person could have imagined 
who had never seen its effects. He advises, therefore, that it should 
not be often repeated, without snuffing up aj&er it a little warm milk 
or oil, to prevent any soreness by fretting the membrane of the 
nostrils. 

Speedy Remedy for u Bruised Eye. 

Boil a baiHlfiil of hyssop leaves in a little water, till they are 
quite tedder ; ti)Niko<>t them tip in linen, apply it hot to the eye, tie 



- 18 . TB£ NBW rAMiur 

it on tightly at bed-time, and the eje wilLnract day be w^L Tins 
receipt is taken from a large and vaiaable collection that foriserij 

belonged to the family of the Karl of Shaftesbury ;.and it is therein 
a:jserted, that *' a man, who had his thigh terribly bruised by the kick 
of a horse, was cured in a few hours, only by a poultice of the leaves of 
hyssop, i^ut or minced very small, and beaten up with unsaited butter. 
Culpepper in his herbal asserts the same respecting the virtues of 
hyssop. 

Stomach Plaster for a Cough,- 

Take bees' wax, Burgundy pitch, and rosin, each an ounce ; melt 
them together in a clean pipkin, and then stir in three quarters of an 
ounce of common turpenline, and half an ounce of oil of mace. 
Spread it on a piece of sheep's leather, grate some nutmeg over the 
whole plaster, and apply it quite warm to the region of the stomach. 

Oil of Brown Paper^ for Burns. 

Take a piece of the thickest coarse brown paper, and dip it in the 
best salad oil ; then set the paper on the fire, and carefnlly preserve 
all the oil that drops for use. This is said to be an admirable remedy 
for all sorts of burns. Oil of writing paper, collected in a similar man- 
lier, is often recommended for the tooth-ache. 

Liquid for removing Spots of Greaae, Pitchy or Oil, from 
fVoollen Cloth, 

In a pint of spring water dissolve an ounce of pure peari-ash ; 
adding, to the solution, a lemon cut in small slices. This being pro-' 
perly mixed, and kept in a warm state fpr two days, the whole must 
be strained, and the cle^r liquid kept in a bottle for use. A little of 
this liquid being poured on the stained part, is said instantaneously to 
remove all spots of grease, pitch, or oil; and the moment they disap- 
pear, the cloth is to be washed in clear water. 

Method of taking out Ink Spots from IVoollen, Linen^ and 

Silk. ^ 

To tak-e spots ot mk out of wooffen, they must first be rubbed 
with a composition, consisting . of the white of an egg, and a few 
drops of oil of vitriol, properly incorporated : next, immediately 
washed witlr pure water ; and, lastly, have the parts smoothed, in the 
direction of the nap, with a piece of flannel or white woollen cloth. 
From linen, ink spots may be removed, by immediately dropping 
plentifully on them, while wet with the ink, the tallow from a lighted 
candle, and letting it remain on a few days before washing the linen : 
this is also said to take the stains of red-port out of linen. Ink spots 
on silk require to be well rubbed with the ashes Of wormwood and 
strong distilled vinegar, and to. b^ afterwards cleansed with soap- 
water. When ink is once dried on linen, the spot is to be taken out 
by rubbing it well with a piece of lemon, and then using a hot \ro» 
till the ink totally dasappeais. If a lemon be ^. jn half; the linen

or there will be a white mark not easily efiaced. 

Red Mixture fqr giving a fine Colour to Mahogany Furniture. 

Stains of ink being first removed by the method above described^ 
wash the tables or other mahogany furniture with vinegar, and then 
rub them all over with a red mixture made in the following manner : 
Put into a pint of cold-drawn linseed oil four pennyworth of alkanet 
root, and two pennyworth of rose-pink ; stir them well together in 
any earthen vessel, and let them remain all night, when the mixture, 
being again well stirred, will be immediately fit for use. When it 
has been left an hour on the furniture, it may be rubbed off till bright 
with linen cloths ; and will soon have a beautiful colour, as weif as 
a glossy appearance. 

Mr. Jayne^s Patent Method of preserving Eggs. 

Various have been the expedients by which good housewives 
have endeavoured to preserve eggs. They have, in turns, been kept 
in salt, in flour, and in bran ; they have been scalded in hot water, 
and deposited at the bottom of a cold running stream ; they have 
been steeped in vinegar, and they have been bathed with oil. None 
of these expedients, however, seem to be universally approved, 
though each has had its respective advocates, and been warmly re- 
commended to attention. In the year 1791, a patent was obtained 

^ by Mr. William Jayne, for his neWly-invented composition calculated 
to preserve eggs. The specification of Mr. Jayne, whose patent 
expired of course in the year 1805, directs ihat, for preparing his 
composition, a Winchester bushel of quick or unslacked lime, two 
pounds of common salt, and half a pound of cream of tartar, should 
be incorporated with such a quantity of common water as may re- 
duce the mixture to a state of consistence in which an egg will float 

, with its top above the surface. In this liquid the eggs are to be 
constantly kept for use ; and the patentee asserts, that they will thus 
certainly be preserved perfectly sound for at least two years. 

Chinese Mode of rendering all Sorts of Cloth^ and even Mu^- 
lin^ Water-Proof 

By the following very simple process for making cloth water-proof, it 
is asserted that the Chinese render not only all the strongest cloths but 
even the most open muslins, impenetrable to the heaviest showers 
of rain ; nor yet, as it is said, will this composition fill up the in- 
terstices of the finest lawn, or ih the slightest degree injure the 
most brilliant colours. The composition to which these valuable 
qualities are imputed, is merely a solution of half an ounce of whiter.

WAX in a pint of spirits of turpentine. In a sufBeient ^manity of the 
mixture, made with these materials, immerse the articles iotendad 
to be rendered water-proof^ and ihen hang them in the open air tiil 
they become perfectly dry. This is all the process necessary for 
accomplishing so desirable a purpose ; against which, however, 
may be objected, perhaps, the expense, and unplea:»nt scent, ol 
the turpentine spirits : the latter objection may be remedied by 
using equal parts of spirits of wine and oil of wormW(K>d, a mixture 
of which is said to dissipate the smell of turpentine ; but the former, 
It is not to be denied, must necessarily be, at the same time, m 
some degree, augmented. It has lately been attempted, in England, 
to render the u^e of water-proof cloth generaL 

beautiful newly^dvicovered Golden Yellow Dye, for SUks, 
Cotton^ fyc. 

This fine, lively, and durable yellow dye, has recently been^ dis- 
covered by M, Lasteyrie, who thus describes the process by which 
it is obtained from the shaggy spunk, or boletus hirsutus of Linnaeus ; 
a species of mushroom, or fungus, growing chiefly on apple or wal- 
nut trees. This vegetable substance is replete with colouring mat- 
ter, which must be expressed by, pounding in a mortar ; after which 
the liquid thus acquired is to be boiled about a quarter of c\n hour. 
Six pints of water may^be well tinged for dying, by a single ounce 
of the expressed fiufd. This being strained, the silk, cotton, &c. 
intended to be dyed, must be immersed and boiled in it for about 
fifteen or twenty minutes ; when fine silk, in particular, if it be after- 
wards passed through soft soap water, will appear of a bright golden 
yellow 4iue, equal in lustre to that of the silk hitherto imported from 
Cliina, at a great expense, for imitating gold embroidery. In short, 
every sort of stuff retains a fine yellow colour ; but it is, of course, 
less bright on linen and cotton. Nor is the use of this vegetable 
substance confined to dying ; since it has been ascertained that 
the yellow extract which it yields is applicable to the ^purposes of 
painting, both in oil and in water colours. 

Curious Method of Breeding an innumerable Quantity of the 
beautiful Gold and Silver Fish. 

The curious process by which this is to be easily effected, may 
be in general applied, en a larger scale, to the breeding, in equal 
profusion, most of our esculent fresh-water fish. It is, simply, as 
follows : Get a large deep cistern or vat, of any dimensions, but one 
of about four feet diameter, and nearly the same height or depth, 
will very well answer the purpose ; then take a quantity of birch, or 
small faggot wood, which has been previously soaked some time in 
a stream, spring, or porfd, so as toHiave lost all power of discc^our- 
ing or giving any farther taste to fresh water, and lay this wood aM 
along the bottom, to the thickness of about a foot, in some parts at 
leasts' having large stones on the top to keep it from rising or motida.

wular, anwflj fill it with the best sod water from a river or poru ■, 
such as there can be no doubt that tish will be able to live in, 'ihti 
?at, it is to beobservedyinust be placed in the open air, but not in a too 
cold or exposed situation ; and the breeding is to commence in the 
spring, when the fish are full, and just ready to spawn. Choose, ad 
breeders, four hard-roed or femalesi and only one soft-roed milcfier 
or male. Put the five, with all possible care not to hurt, them, into 
the vat ; feeding them occasionally, by throwing in a few crumbs of 
bread, or some other trifling food, but in no other way disturbing them. 
When they appear quite thin, or shotten as it is termed, they must be 
quietly taken out with a small net, so as by no means to disturb the 
spawn, and entirely kept away ; as they would, if allowed to remain, 
(such is the nature of these and most other fish,)^ soon devour the 
greatest part of the spawn and small fry, suffering little or none ever 
to reach maturity. The vat must not be disturbed during the whole 
summer ; only, as the water decreases, a little fresh must from time 
to time be as gently as possible poured in, to supply the deficiency. 
In the course of the summer, the vivified roes will be hatched, and 
the water perceived swarming with a minute fry ; fully sufficient to 
stock a large piece of water, if not devoured by other fish, or the 
several birds which make fish their prey. By this m'ethod, myriads 
of those beautiful fish may be easily bred ; and, consequently, be- 
come very common. At present, it is true, though originally intro- 
duced from the East Indies, of which) as well as of China', the gold 
fish, or cyprinus auratus of Lifinseus, is a native, it is still chiefly 
kept in glass globular vessels for ornament. It has, however, within 
these few years, been sufficiently ascertained, that these fishes 
thrive and propagate in ponds, or other reservoirs of water ; where, 
ttey are said to acquire a much larger growth, and come to greater 
perfection, than in the oriental countries. 

Syrup of Red Cabbage j as prepared in France, 

Cut and wash a large red cabbage, put it into .a pot covered with 
water, and let it simmer three or four hours over a moderate fire, till 
there only remains about a pint of liquor ; then strain it through a 
sieve, pressing the cabbage forcibly to get all the juice ; let the liquor 
stand some hours tq settle, and pour oS* the clear. Put a pound of 
Narbonne honey into a saucepan, over a stove, with a glass of water ; 
and keep skimming it all the time it is boiling, till it be com|>Ietely 
clarified. Then put in the cabbage juice, and make the whole boil 
to the consistence of a syrup ; which is always to be known, by ta- 
king a little of it on one finger, and finding that, on its being rubbed 
against the next, it foritia a thread which does not instantly break. 
This syrup is regarded in France as a most excellent fortifier of the 
breast. It is nndoubtedly a good, pectoral syrup, very pleasant, not 
at all expensive, aad easily made. A decoction of red cabbage, 
even in England, by some eminent physicians, has been frequently 
recommended for softening acrimonious hunotours in disorders of the 
breast, and also in hottrseness.

Boluses for the Rheumatism and CoMraciioas of ike J^nts 

Bruise four cloves of garlic with two drachms of gum ammoniaf 
and make them into six boluses with spring water. Take one every 
morning and evening, drinking plentifuliy of sassafras tea, at least 
lwip« a day, while using this medicine. '1 his is :?aid' to be a most

Pill for an Aching Hollow Tooth. 

Take half a grain each of opium and yellow sub-sulphate of quick- 
silver, formerly called turpeth mineral ; make them into a pill, and 
place it in the hollow of the tooth some hours before bed*time, with 
a small piece of wax over the top, when it is said never to fail eflSect- 
ing a complete cure. It was originally communicated, with many 
other medical receipts, by a learned physician at York. 

Tea for the Gout. 
Take the leaves of carduus benedictus, or the holy thistle, with a 
sufficient proportion of angelica leaves to make it palatable, 6ut not 
much of either at a time, and drink half a pint of this infusion made 
like common tea, rather weak, constantly every morning Sot twelve 
months. This is said to have alone relieved several persons who were 
almost crippled with the gout. The leaves of (he blessed thistle, in 
strong decoction, are generally agreed to be beneficial where there 
is a loss of appetite, or the stomach has been impaired by irregulari- 
ties ; and, whether an infusion be made in cold or warm water, it 
occasions, if drank freely, a copious perspiration, and greatly pro- 
motes the secretions. The dried leaf, which may be used for making 
the lea recommended^ loses much of that forbidding flavour always 
possessed by the fresh plant ; and which occasions it to be some- 
times empieyed in strong decoctions, either as an emetic, or as the 
auxiliary of an emetic. 

Infallible Powder for Shortness of Breath. 

This excellent remedy for shortness of breath is piarticulariy re- 
commended to young ladies. The powder is thus directed to be 
made : Take an ounce each of carraway seeds and anniseeds, half

and two ounces of double-^refined sugar'; reduce the whole info :. 
very fine powder, and take as much as will He on a shilling every 
morning fasting, and the same quantity at five in the afternoon. It 
will be requisite to use exercise while takmg this medicine, which 
generally very soon effects a cure. Where any invincible prejudice 
against the use of steel exists in the mind, the medicine may be 
tried without it ; it will even then frequently afford relief.

Mustard Whey, for a Palsy and Nervous Disorders* 

Turn half a pint of boiling milk, by putting in a table-spooniiil of 
made mustard. Strain the whey from the curd, through a sieve, and 
drink it in bed. This will give a generous and glowing warmth, the 
whey thus conveying the mustard into the constitution. Dr. Stephen 
Hales says, that he knew a woman, who had a great degree of numb- 
ness all over her, remarkably relieved with two doses only, and men- 
tions several instance^ where it has done good in nervous cases, and 
in palsy, greatly abating the malady and prolonging life. 

Ingenious French Vegetative Liquid Jor making Bulbous Roots 
flower beautifully in ornamental CUasses, without Earthy du-^ 
ring the Winter Season. 

Dissolve, gradually, in a glazed earthen or glass vessel, three 
ounces of saltpetre, one ounce of common salt, and half an ounce 
of salt of" tartar, with a pint of rain water. When the solution is 
cdfnpleted, add half an ounce of loaf sugar ; filter the whole through 
a bag or blotting paper, and keep it bottled for use. Into each flowc^r- 
glass, filled with rain or river water, are to be put eight or ten drops 
of this liquid. The glasses must be kept constantly full, and the 
water renewed every tenth or twelfth day at farthest ; to which must 
always be added the requisite number of drops of the vegetative li- 
quor. To ensure complete success, however, the glasses ought to 
stand on a mantle or chimney-piece where a fire is regularly kept in 
cold weather. Tl^e fibres of the roots most of course always im^ 
bibe the liquid ; and, with proper management, a fine succession of 
flowers may be kept up during the most rigorous seasons ; such as 
crocuses of difiierent colours^ tulips, hyacinths^ snow-drops, &c. 

Art qf Extracting the finest Carmine Powdsr from Clippings 
of Scarlet Cloth. 

That incomparable crimson colour, called carmine, which so 
beautifully participates in the most delicate tints of scarlet and of 
purple, is so very expensive, that miniature painters are oflen induced 
to substitute for carmine a composition of lake ; by the following pro- 
cess, howevfir, it is credibly asserted, that a better carmine may with 
certainty be manufactured than much of what is imported from France. 
Take five or six gallons of the purest water, and dissolve in • it a 
sufficient quantity of pot-ash to make a strong ley. Afler having 
filtered the solution, put it in a brass pot, and boil in it a pound 6f 
the clean shreds or clippings of the finest scarlet broad cloth dyed in 
grain^ till they have entirely lost their colour ; then squeeze the slneds^ 
and pass all the ley through a flannel bag. Dissolve two pounds of 
alum in a proper quantity of water, and add this solution to the ley ; 
stir them well together* and the whole will become rather thick. It 
is then to be repassed through the flannel bag, and the liquor will run 
out clear ; but, if it be at all tinged, it is agfiin to be boiled, with (he 
addition of a small quantity of dissolved alum, and passed through

the bag a third time, when all the caronine will be left behind i'^rcsh 
water is then to be poured repeatedly into the bag, till all the alum 
is washed away : after which the colour must be dried, so as to 
prevent any dust from settling on it ; and, being previously reduced 
to an impalpable powder, on gla^s or marble, it will be immediately 
fit for use. 

Suhstitute for Verdigrease^ in producing a fine Black Dye 
wiihottt Injury to Cloth, ^c. 

As verdigrease, though generally combined with logwood for 
dying black, is extremely apt to corrode the texture of the cloth, &c. 
the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and 
Commerce, in the Adelphi, rewarded Mr. Clejg for his discovery of a 
substitute in dying that colour. For this purpose, equal parts of 
pot-ash, or any other strong alkaline salt, and vitriol of copper, are 
to be separately dissolved, and the two solutions gradually aiixed. 
If the vitriol be sufficier»tly saturated, the water on the suiiace will 
become transparent on adding a few drops of the alkaline solution ; 
hut, if not, it will produce a blue colour, so that no pot-ash should 
bd added till a complete saturation be effected. These proportions 
of vitriol and alkaline salt will be equivalent to a similar quantity of 
verdigrease ; and, on being combined with decoctions of logwood, 
in the same manner as verdigrease, will impart a fine black d^'e, 
which is by no means prejudicial to the texture of cloth, hats, or 
otiier articles, so.often rotted by pernicious blaok dyes. 

Artificial Musk, 

Tiie mode of making artificial musk, which is oAen used in Ger- 
many for that expensive odorous drug, is simply as follows : Add, to 
one drachm of oil of amber, by small portions at a time, four times 
the quantity of nitrous acid, commonly called aqua-fortis ; carefully 
stirring them together with jbl glass rod all the time, and continuing 
so to do till the whole be-rcon verted into a yellow resin, possessing 
the smell of musk in great perfection. It must, of course, be kept 
closely stopped up, like real musk ; and may sometimes supply the 
place of that high-priced article, not forgetting the nature of its chief 
ingredient. 

fVonderfiil but easy and effectual Method of rendering all Sorts 
of Paper Fire-Proof 

This astonishing effect is produced by a most simple process. 
It is only necessary, whether the paper be plain, written, or printed 
on, or even marbled, stained, on painted for hangings, to immerse it 
in a strong solution of alum- water, and then thoroughly dry it, when 
it will immediately become fire proof. This experiment is readily 
ascertained, by holding a slip of paper thus prepared over a candle. 
Some paper, however, will require to imbibe more of the solution 
thaA it may receive by a single immersion ; in which case, the 
operation of dipping and drying must be repeated till such paper be-

lour nor quality of the paper will be in the smallest degree affected ; 
but that, on the contrary, both will be even improved. 

Bellamy*s Patent Methods of making LetHther of all Sorts 
fVater-Proof 

The patentee and inventor of these methods, Mr. John Bellamy, 
makes use of^ two compositions ; which, according to his specifica- 
tion in the Patent Office, registered 1794, tfre as follow : A gallon 
each of nut and poppy oils are to be mixed with three gallons of 
linseed oil ; or, one gallon of either nut or poppy oil may be added 
to three of that expressed from linseed ; or, two gallons of linseed 
oil may be combined with a pint of nut oil and the like quantity of 
poppy oil. These ingredients, either in the above proportions, or 
such others as may be required by the nature of the oils, being mix- 
ed in an iron pot, are to be placed over a gentle fire ; and to each 
gallon of oil must be added a pound of white copperas, sugar of lead, 
colcothar, or any other drying substance. When the whole has re-, 
mained six or seven hours over such a degree of heat as it will bear 
without rising, till it become sufficiently dry, it is to be taken of]', 
and suffered to cool ; this first compound is then fit for use. Thp 
second compound, for the same purpose of rendering all kinds of 
leather water-proof, is thus directed to be made :' Take a pound of 
gum resin, half a pound of pitch, and a quarter of a pound each of 
tar and turpentine ; well mix these ingredients with one gallon of the 
oils prepared according to the first method, by gently heating the 
entire mass, and then increasing the fire till the. whole be thoroughly 
incorporated. When the oils prepared according to the first method, 
or the gums according to the second, are sufficiently cool, either is 
to be rubbed into the leather with a brush dipped in the respective 
composition ; and the thoroughly-impregnated leather being stretched 
on an even board, the superfluous matter is to be removed from its 
surface. Sole leather, and other thick substances, are to be first 
gently warmed : and, after being fully saturated with the composition, 
and properly dried in a warm place, they are ready for use. 

Genuine Receipt for making the Invaluable Cordial Liquor

ness of breath, &c.- The following are the genuine instructions for 
making it : Take a thick giants or stone bottle which will hold consider- 
ably more than two English quarts, and put in it two Paris pints, 
being equal to about two English quarts, of the best brandy ; adding 
the following seeds, first grossly pounded in a mortar ; two drachms 
cT angelica seeds, one ounce of coriander seeds, and a large pinch

nose and temples fasting, it is a preservative of the person so using 
it against the ill effects of damp or unwholesome air. In short, this 
liquor will abundantly satisfy all who may liave occasion to use it; 
and a gentleman having been long afflicted with an hepatic flux, 
which gave him continual torment, the use of this liquor carried^it 
off, and completely cured him. 

Incomparable Method of Saliinff Meaty as adopted by the late 
Empress oj Hussia, 

The following method of salting meat is asserted to have been 
used by the great empress Catharine, in her household establishment, 
with the utmost success : Boil together, over a gentle fire, six pounds 
of common salt, twQ pounds of powdered loaf sugar, three ounces of 
saltpetre, and three gallons of spring water. Carefully skim it while 
boiling ; and, when quite cold, pour it over the meat, every part of 
which must be covered with the brine. In this pickle, it is said, the 
meat will not only keep for many months, but the hardest and 
toughest beef will thus be rendered as mellow and tender as the flesh 
of a young fowl ; while either beef, pork, or even mutton, will hdve 
a fine flavour imparted by it. In warm weather, however, the blood 
must be expressed from the meat, and the whole well rubbed over 
with fine salt, before it is immersed in the liquor. Young pork should 
not be left longer than three or four days in this pickle, as it will then 
be quite sufficiently softened': but hams, intended for drying, may 
remain a fortnight before they are hung up ; when they should be 
rubbed with pollard, and closely covered with paper bags, to prevent 
their hieing fly-blown. Though this pickle is, at first, somewhat 
more expensive than common brine, (as it may^be again used, on 
being boiled with additional water and the other ingredients,) itns far 
from being, on the whole, importantly more dear ; whilst it seems to 
promise advantages which most people would be happy to purchase 
at a much higher price.

%9fi ef making the best Black Ink Powder. 

Infuse a quarter of a pound of finely powdered nut galls in three 
pints of rain or river water ; exposing it, occasionally well stirred, 
tcAa moderate degree of warmth for a few daj^, till the colouring 
matter seems fully extracted : then filter the solution into a vessel 
slightly covered, and place it in the open air for several weeks : when, 
on removing the mouldy skin from the top, which has gradually been 
formed, it must be carefully collected, have hot water poured over 
it, undergo another filtration, and then be^ evaporated to dryness. 
Thus will be produced a gray crystalline salt, called the acid salt of 
^alls, and which is the essential basis of black ink. On triturating 
a single drachm of this salt with an eaual quantity of vitriol of iron, 
and about a pennyweight of the driest gum arabic, a composition 
will be obtained which affords an excellent black ink, merely on 
being dissolved in warm water. 

Genuine Syrup for Coughs, Spitting of Bloody SfC

liberal Dr. Fuller, " b'e a mere stranger in physic, who is not ac- 
quainted with this most noble syrup, and how mightily it succours 
those who cough up blood." It is thus made : Take six ounces of 
comfrey roots, an4 twelve handsful of plantain leaves : cut and beat 
them well ; strain out the juice ; and, with|in equal weight of sugar, 
boil it up to a syrup. 

T^ast advantages of Baking instead of Boiling Beet^Root, 

The beet-root too forcibly intrudes itself on the improved sagacity 
of mankind to be entirely neglected, as a source of cheap and saly> 
brious food. The late Dr. Lettsom, some few years since, took 
uncommon pains to recommend a variety of one species of this 
genus, the German mangel-wurzel, or famine-root, under the ap- 
pellation of the root of scarcity, or large white beet-root, as an ar- 
ticle worthy of being universally cultivated. The time, however, 

, seems not yet arrived for the full value of even the more attractive 
red species to be generally known and duly appreciated \ so that his 
philaixthropic design may be said to have hitherto fuiled. In speak- 
ing of the beet-root generally, the red beet-root, therefore, is to be 
considered as alone designated ; and we are about, to offer a few 
hints for bringing its modest and humble merits into a little more 
deserved estimation. The rich saccharine juice of the beet-root is, 
in a great degree, lost, and the root itself rendered, at once, less 
nutritious by the adventitious watery weakness which it is made to* 

. imbibe, as well as by parting with the native gelatinous syrup, of 
which it is thus forcibly deprived. It is, therefore, most strongly 
recommended to adopt the mode of baking beet-roots, instead of 
boiling them, for general use; when they will, unquestionably, be* 
found to afford a very delicious and most wholesome food. This is 
not offered as an untried novelty : be^roots are universally baked'

Remedy for Wind in the Veins, 

This state of the veins, though always visible on the slightest in- 
spection^ often escapes any notice, though it leads to many disorders. 
The following remedy may be taken with advantage ^vhenever they 
appear in a suspicious state : Take equal quantities of powdered 
liquorice, carraway seeds, and sugar candy : to which add a third 
part of rhubarb, and the like quantity of cream of tartar, both finely 
pulverized. Of this nntxture', take a tea-spoonful three or fbur tinoes 
a day ; eitheV by itself, or in a glass of wine. It should be continued 
about a week ; and, being gently laxative, it cools the blood, eases 
pains, and relieves and prevents many disorders. 

Best Method of making Sage Cheese.

emptying it into a cheese vat, let it be a little pressed, in order to make 
it eat mellow. Having stood for about seven hours, salt and turn it 
daily for four or five weeks, when it will be fit for the table. The

o^ the sage, will give it a much more pleasing colour tl^an can be ob- 
tained from sage alone. 

Syrup of Cringtr. 

An agreeable and moderately aromatic syrup, impregnated with 
the flavour and medicinal virtues of ginger, is thus prepared : Ma- 
cerate an ounce and a half of beaten ginger in a quart of boiling 
water, closely covered up, for twenty-four hburs : then, straining off 
the infusion, make it into a syrup, by adding at least two parts of 
fine loaf sugar, dissolved and boiled up in a hot water bath. 

Wonderful Power of the Turkish GluCy or Armenian Cenientf 
with the Art of making it* 

The jewellcM-s in Turkey, who are mostly Armenians, according 
to Mr. Eton, formerly a consul, and author of the Survey of the 
Turkish Empire, have a singular method of ornamenting watch- 
c^ses, &c. with dianionds and other precious stones, by simply gin- 
ing or cementing them. The stone is set in silver or gold, and the 
other part of the metal made flat to correspond with the part to which 
it is to be fixed ; it is then warmed gently, and has the glue applied, 
which is so very strong, that the parts cemented never separate. Tlits

glue,- which will strongly unite bits oiP glass, and even polished steel, 
and may of course be applied to a vast variety of useful purposes, 
is thus tnade : Dissolve five or six bits of guili niastrcb, each the 
size of a large pea, in as much spirits of wine as will sufBce. to ren- 
der it liquid : and, in another vessel, dissolve as much isinglass, pre- 
viously a little swelled or softened in water, though none of the 
water must be used, in French brandy or good ruen, as will make a 
two-ounce phial of very strong glue : adding two small bits of gum 
galbanum, or iimmoniacum, which must be rubbed or ground till 
they are dissolved. Then mix the whole with a sufficient heat. 
Keep the glue in a phial stopped close, and, when it is to be used, 
set the bottle in hot or boiling water. Mr. Eton observes, that some 
persons have, in England, prepared and sold this composition under 
the name of Armenian Cement ; but it is much too thin^ and the 
quantity of mastich in it too 'small : it must, this gentleman adds, be 
Hke strong carpenters' glue. This certainly is one of the most 
valuable known cements in the world. Nor is it at all improbable, 
that a plan, said to have been invented in France or Germany, for 
making up, clothes, &€< by unitjing cloth without sewing, in some at- 
tempt founded on the use of this very cement ; with what ultimate 
success, we must leave time to develope. In the mean while, there 
.can be no sort of doubt, that much may be effected by ingenious 
applications of so powerful an agent. 

Valuabh Sicret in preparing Foil for Diamonds, and other 
precious Stones,^ as used by the Armenian Jewellers, 

The method of preparing the rich foils in which Ihe Armenian 
jewellers set precious stones, particularly diamonds, to much advan- 
tage, and which, under roses or half-bnlliants, is npiost remarkably 
beautiful, and not subject to tarnish, is generally kept as a great se- 
cret ; and such foils, Mr. Eton assures us, sells at Constantinople 
for from half to three-quarters of a dollar each. The mode of pre- 
paring them is extremely simple. An agate is cut, and highly po- 
lished, of the shape desired ; a cavity of about its own siee is next 
formed in a block of lead, and over this cavity is placed a bit of tht, 
the thickness of strong brown paper, scraped' very bright. The 
agate is then placed on the tin, over the cavity, and struck with a 
mallet ; when the beautiful polish which the tin instantly receives, is 
scarcely to be imagined by those who have never seen it. 

Easy method of Dying Cotton with Madder^ as practised at 

Smyrna, 

Cotton, at Smyrna, Mr. Eton tells us, is dyed with madder in 
Ihe following manner : The cotton is boiled in comltron olive oil, 
and then in mild alkali ; being thus cleaned, it will take the mad- 
der dye : and this is the fine colour so greatly admired in Smyrna 
cotton-yarn. " I have heard," adds this gentleman, " that the sura 
of &ve thousand ponnds was given iu England for this secret !" It is, 
doubtless, a secret in preparing cottons, and perhaps other articles, 
for the reception of a particular dye, very well worth knowing

Celebrated French Worm Medicine for Dogs,. 

This medicine has the reputation of effectually killing and ex- 
pelling the worms with which dogs are often so grievously tor- 
mented, and which, probably, may be one grand cause of their 
running mad. It is thus made : Take, for one dose, which generaJly 
proves sufficient, two drachms each of juice of wormwood, aloes, 
and staves-acre> the two last powdered as small as possible ; with 
one drachm each of pounded burnt hartshorn and sulphur. Mix 
the whole together in nut oil^ to the quantity of about half a glass, 
which must be given to the dog for a dos^« If at all necessarj, 
another dose may be given a day or two after. 

Superior Use of the celebrated German Tivkder^ and great Fin- 
portance of its being universally adopted. 

On the continent of Europe, every traveller^ sportsman, &c. car- 
ries constantly this tinder about him, which is conveniently portable, 
and resembles a piece of soft and very thick tanned leather, of elas- 
tic substance, and a sort of velvet surface on the upper part. It is, 
in fact, a large fungus, commonly calicfd punk, which grows at the 
roots of old trees, where it s{)reads to a considerable size. This 
substance is dressed, !;ammered, and otherwise manufactured for 
the purpose, into this appearance, and, being dried, forms the true 
German tinder at all times ready for use, and far less liable to be- 
come damp than English tinder. The manner of using it is by 
tearing off a small bit, which will serve several times, and holding it 
at the edge of the flint, which is smote by the steel, instead of the 
steel by the flint. In this the Germans are so expert, and can so 
well rely on their tinder, that they will engage to light it at a single 
stroke, and, indeed,- seldom fail to do so. The tinder being thus 
kindled, may be placed in a pipe of tobacco, or extinguished in- 
stantly between the finger and thumb, after lighting a match for this 
or any other purpose. It is always kept in a pouch or box, with a 
flint, steel, and short German matches ; and few persons are much 
from home without carrying them constantly in their pockets. If the 
German tinder were to be manufactured in England, many poor 
persons might be employed in collecting the punk, which is now 
suffered to rot without utility; and, could it be brought entirely' to 
prevent the destruction of rags for tinder, a quantity far exceeding 
what may be generally imagined, it might prove the meaftis of greatly 
assisting the manufacture of paper.

Turkish Method of Filtering Water by Ascension. 

The process is this : They tnake two w^lls,Trom five to (en feet, 
or any other depth, at a small distance from each other, with a com- 
munication between the two at their bottoms. The separation is of 
clay well beaten, or other substances impenetrable by water. Both 
wells are then filled with sand and gravel. The opening of the well 
^nto which the water to be filtered runs, is made somewhat higher 
vthan that into which it is to ascend ; nor does the sand of this latter 
approach the brim, where there is either sufficient room left for all 
the filtered water, or it is drawn off by a spout run into a vessel 
placed for that purpose. The greater the difference is between the 
height of the two wells, the faster the water filters ; but the less it is, 
the better it operates, provided a sufficient quantity of water be sup- 
plied by it for the intended purpose. This, Mr. Eton observes, may 
be practised in a cask, tub, jar, or other vessel, and would be use- 
ful on board of ships : the water being conveyed to the bottom by a 
pipe, and the lower end having in it a sponge, or the pipe might be 
filled with coarse sand. It is evident, that all such particles as, by 
their gravity, are carried down in filtration by descent, will not rise" 
with the water in filtration by ascension. From this account, it 
should seem, that the principle of filtration by ascent, considered 
as a new discovery by some ingenious Europeans, has been .long 
known to the Turks. 

Mr, Peacock^ s Patent Machine for Purifying and Filtering the 
foulest water. 

The utility of filtering machines, . in the different processes of 
brewing, distillery, and dying, as well as that of making bread, and 
all other domestic arts, is sufficiently obvious. The filtering ma- 
chine of Mr, Peacock has been contrived and composed with a com- 
bination of skill and simplicity which is seldom witnessed. The 
turbid fluid is poured into a vessel, with layers of sifted gravel or 
small pebbles, in different gradations of size, at the botton, and con- 
nected somewhat like the Turkish filtering wells, with a similar 
vessel, with like sjrata or layers, in progressive degrees of fineness, 
through which the water, however foul, on its entrance into the first 
vessel, now rises clear and pure in this. Had Mr. Peacock, who is 
one of the first architects in the world, been a poor or a mercenary 
man, this invention mi^rht have obtained him a large fortune : .but, 
being neither one nor the other, though this gentleman secured his 
right by patent, and he was only solicitous of its being adopted 
from philanthropic motives, and has probably lost more money 



32 TH£ NEW FAMILY 

Ulan he hfts gmaed by the invention. When its use hecom^ duly 
appreciated, some future manufacturer of Mr. Peacock's filtering 
macliines may probably reap (he advantage. A specimen of k^ 
machine is deposited in Guildhall, London, and, though capable of 
yielding a constant and pure stream of three hundred gallons in 
twenty-four hours, it does not occupy more room than a comnaon 
^largedripor filtering stone, with all its accompanying apparatus: 
that nothing may be wanting to its perfection, it is easily -deansed, 
though seldom necessary, in the short space of a single minute. 
Nothing, therefore, is easier than for brewers, distillers, dyers, &c. 
who are so inclined, to have all their water filtered by means of Mr. 
Peacock's invention, which is capable of being extended to any 
magnitude, at an expense which cannot be the smallest object to 
the generality of persons concerned in those respective manufac- 
tories. This invention, could it be brought into general use, might 
be considered as a blessing to the nation. At sea, if the strata may be 
so fixed as not to be too much disturbed or deranged by the shp's 
motion, which seems very possible, the use of such a machine must 
be so great, that no vessel ought to sail without one* A little char- 
coal| from its antiseptic quaUty, might -perhaps be introduced with 
advantage among the stiata of gravel. The want of filtered water 
gives rise to more nephritic complaints than is imagined* 

^ Management of Coffee in France. 

Those who wish to have excellent coffee, in France, roast it every 
day as it is used : they even say, that it should be roasted, ground, 
infused, and drunk, in the space of two hours ; and assert that, if 
these processes be longer in succeeding each other, the coflee loses 
much of that volatile spirit which constitutes all its agreeable flavour 
The quantity commonly used is an ounce to five cups of spnng wa- 
ter, to produce four of good and clear coffee. In the mean time, it is 
usual to throw their coffee grounds into a vessel, boil them half an 
hour, and leave them to^ settle : this infusion so well serves for a 
third part of the coffee in powder, that in a coffee-pot of fourteen 
cups of pure spring water, which should have three ounces to be 
good, two ounces with this infusion will be of equal strength and good- 
ness. The operation of boiling the grounds is performed, in large 
coffee-houses, five or six times every day. This is the common 
way of making coffee throughout France, where it is generally drank 
with sugar and cream ; while, at different coffee-houses, and in par- 
ticular families, vanilla, isinglass, and other ingredients, are also in- 
troduced, as they have lately been in England. The French, beside 
breakfasting often on coffee, usually drink two cups about half an 
hour after dinner, to hasten digestion, or abate the fumes of wine 
and liqueurs when they have been taken to exceed the bounds of ne- 
cessity. I

effectually destroying those noisome J^ermin Bugs,

iiceifeiPT-Booit.' 33 

rectified spirits of wine in a strong bottle, and nM in smaU pieces 
about half an oance of camphtre, which will dissolve in a few minutes. 
Shake the mixture well together ; and, with a sponge or brush dip- 
ped in it, well wet the bed arid furniture where the vermin breed. 
This will infallibly destroy both them and their nits, though they 
swarm. The dust, however, should be well brushed from the bed- 
stead and furniture, to prevent, from such carelessness, any stain. 
If that precaution is attended to, there will be no danger of soiling 
the richest silk or damask. 

On touching a live bug with onYy the tip of a pin put into the mix- 
ture, the insect will be instantly deprived of existence, and 'should 
any bugs happen to appear after using the mixture, it will only be 
from not wetting the linen, &c. of the bed ; the foldings or Hnings 
of the curtains near the rings or the joints, or holes in and about the 
bed or head-board, in which places the vermin nestle and breed ; so 
that those parts being well wetted with more of the fixture, which 
dries as fast as it is used, and pouring it into the joints and holes, 
where the sponge, and brush cannot reach, it will never fail totally 
to destroy them. 

The smell of this mixture, though powerful, is extremely whole- 
some, and to maiiy persons very agreeable. It exhales, however, in 
two or three days. 

• Only one caution ijs necessary ; but that is important. The mix- 
ture must be well shaken when used ; but neiver applied by candle- 
light, lest the spirits, being attracted by the flare of the candle, might 
cause a conflagration. 

Grand Ptiscm, or Diet Drink of Health and Longevity^ by a 
celebrated French Physician^ who lived nearly a hundred and 
twenty years. 

The famous inventor of this admirable prolonger of human exist- 
ence was Monsieur De Sainte Catharine ; who, by taking it himself 
for a fortnight, three times a year, before winter, toward Easter, and 
during the greatest heats of summer, lived to the age of nearly an 
hundred and twenty years. This ptisan is pronounced useful to ail 
sorts of persons : if they are ill, to cure them ; if well, to preserve 
them in health. It is even good for infants ; and, above all, excel- 
lent for old people. An infinitude of facts attest its wonderfuf ef- 
fects. It is thus directed to be prepared : Take about a quart* of the 
best-sifted and well-washed oats, and a small handful of wild succory 
roots newly drawn out of the earth ; boil them gently in six quarts 
of river water for three-quarters of an hour, and then add half an 
ounce of crystal mineral, and three or four spoonsful of the best 
honey, or a quarter of a pound of it in weight. Let the whole now 
boil half an hour longer ; then strain it through linen, put the liquid 
MATi earthen vessel, and leaVe it covered to cool. For persons of a 
bilious habit, only half the quantity of honey should be used, as the 
sweetness has a tendency to increase the bile. Two good glasses 
of this ptisan should be drank every morning fasting, without eating 
any thing for Isome hours ; and the same quantity three hours after

good eifect. It is natural thai {persona who are totf> groBs and ^^oetiTe 
should commence with some, previous purgative ; after which this 
remedy will prove more efficacious. This ptisan is easy to take, 
and pleasant in its operations ; not occasioning any griping pains or 
other disagreeable sensations : at the same time, it perfectly ^eanses 
the reins, is very diuretic, greatly promotes expectoration ; purges 
the brain ; cleanses the lungs, the liver, and the spleen ; expels pu- 
trid and malignant humours, all pain from the head, gravel, and even 
stone when newly formed ; cures tertian and quartan ague^, bowr^ 
ever inveterate ; all colics and pleurisies ; the itch, blotches, and 
other foul eruptions ; and, in short, every kind of heaviness, lassi- 
tude, and general debility. It rouses the senses, clears the sight, 
excites appetite, and gives rest and sleep. It refreshes, feeds, and 
conveys perfect health ; and even seems atill sensibly operating, 
and doing good, for a month or two after it has been taken* It is, 
beside all this, very nourishing. Instead of weakening, as is the 
c:ise with the greater part of other remedies, it absolutely strengthens: 
and, during the dog-days and greatest heats of summer, when medi- 
cines in general are subject to become dangerous, and even fatal, 
\\iis is in fact more salutary than at any other season. It might, in- 
deed, be taken every day without doing the smallest injury ; the 
party taking cane, during intensely cold weather, to keep constantly 
warm. To attain long life, it will perhaps be sufficient to take it for 
a fortnight once or twice in the year ; if once only, during the great 
heats, as the best season for its use. This panegyric, however 
great, is translated almost verbatim from a most respectable Fr»ach 
author. It is undoubtedly an excellent medicine.

the phosphorus melts, and adheres to the taper or match. A line

about with a piece of red-hot iron wire, till the phosphorus is all 
spread over and adheres to the internal surface of the bottle, where 
it will form a reddish coating. When, by repeated introduciiens of 
the heated wire, this is completely effected, the bottle is to reipain 
open a quarter of an hour, and then be corked for use. One end of 
a common match beins put into a bottle thus prepared, on touching 
the phosphorus, and being suddenly drawn out, will be with certainty 
lighted. As there can he no particular danger of accidental fire 
from the use of these bottles; and, with reasonable care in using 
them, and keeping them closely stopped, a single bottle would last 
ft considerable time, and might, were the demand general, be replen- 
iahed^at a moat trifling expense : it may, possibly, in the hands of 
some ingenious and enterprising person, be finally made to super- 
sede the tinder-box, -that dreadfulVsonsumer of rags, and consequent

Siareh from Horse Cke$nut$. 

The patent for Ibis useful invention and discovery is dated March 
8, 1796 ; of course the exclusive privilege of extracting starch from 
horse chesnuts in the following manner was confined to the patentee 
till the expiration of fourteen years. We shall present our curious 
readers with the mode of preparing this starch in his lordship's own 
words, extracted from the specification in the Patent Office : << I iirst 
lake the horse chesnuts out of the outward green prieitly husks ; 
and then, either by hand, with a knife or other too(, or else with a 
mill adapted for that purpose, I very carefuNy pare off the brown 
rind : being particular not to leave the smallest speck, and to entirely 
eradicate the sprout or growth. I next take the nutB, and rasp, grate, 
or grind, them fine into water : either by hand, or by a miH adapted 
for that purpose. The pulp, which is thereby formed in that water, 
I wash as clean as possible through a coarse hair sieve ; and then, 
again, through a still finer ; constantly adding clean water, to pre- 
vent any starch from adhering to the pulp. The Tast process is, to 
put it, with a large quantity of water, about four gallons to a pound 
of starch, through a 6ne gauze, muslin, or lawn, so as entirely to 
clear it of all bran, or other impurities. As soon as it settles, I pour 
ofi* the water, and then mix it up with clean ; repeating this operation 
till it no longer imparts any green, • yellow, or other colour, to the 
water. I then drain it off, till nearly dry ; and set it to bake, either 
in the usual mode of baking starch, or else spread out before a brisk 
fire ; being very attentive to stir if frequently, to prevent its homing ; 
that is to say, turning to. a paste or jelly, which, on being dried, turns 
hard like horn. The whole proce^ should be conducted as quick 
as possible. The utility of this invention requires no comment. 
Should it come into general use, not only a vast consumption <^ 
wheat flour must be saved ; but, from the necessity of planting more 
ehesnut trees, for the sake of a fruit hitherto considered as of lio 
sort of value, much of that excellent and beautiful wood will be pro- 
duced for the many purposes to which it is applicable. 

Patent Potato Composition to be used instead of Yeast. 

For this ingenious contrivance, which introduces pot^tos as a 
sort of leaven for making wheaten bread, a patent was obtained by 
the inventor, Mr. Richard Tillyer Blunt, in the year 1787 ; which, 
of course, is now expired. The following is the process for this 
purpose, as described by Mr. Blunt in his specification : To make 
a yeast gallon of this composition, such yeast gallon containing 
eight beer quarts, boil in common water eight pounds of potatos 
as for eating; bruise them perfectly smooth ; and mix with them 
while warm, two ounces of honey, or any other sweet, and one beer 
quart of common yeast For making bread, mix three beer pinto 
of the above composition with a bushel of flour, using warm water 
m making the bread. The water to be warmer in winter than in 
sttoinier, and the composition to be used in a few honni after tl is

made, and put in the oven. 

• Britannic Elastic Gum* 

For the invention of this curious and useful composition, a 'patent 
was obtained, in the year 1781, by Mr. Albert Angel :' who describes 
it, in his specification, as being very serviceable and useful in the 
severakbranches of portrait and house painting, by making the co- 
lours durable and free from peeling ; as of great utility in gildipg, 
painting, penciling, and staining of silks, calicos, &c, and in dress- 
ing silk, linen, and cotton, inUie loom, instead of gum or paate^ 
so as to strengthen the threads of the finest cottons ; as excellent 
for beautilying and fixing the colours on paper, equal to that done 
in India ; as of the greatest use for rendering the clay, or composi- 
tion, used, in modeling, sufficiently supple, and preveating its drying 
too fast ; and, lastly, not less efiectual in causing a transparency of 
colours fit for china and earthen ware, so as to stand baking or buru- 
tng. This Britannic gum is stated to be prepared in the following 
very simple manner : Put into an iron kettle, and melt -down to- 
gether, till the mixture become this compostUoa or elastic gum, a 
gallon of linseed or nut oil, a pound of yellow or bleached bees* 
wax, six pounds of glue or siflEO, a quarter of a pound of verdigrease, 
« quarter of a pound of litharge, aid two quajrts of spring or rain 
water.

wormwood. Infuse the whole in two quarts of brandyv rum, or 
Madeira wine ; and, after it has stood some time, pour off what is 
clear, and add to the ingredients a quart more of either liquor, though 
brandy is considered as best for the purpose. TUs, too, havisg re<- 
mained a somewhat longer time, and been occasionaUy shaken, may 
be in like manner poured ofl*for use. Two tea^spoo^ul,^or some- 
what less, are directed to be taken, an hour before dinner, in half m 
glass of wine.

with the faculty. It is thus made : Boil, in a pint of vinegar, half an 
ounce of cleansed carrawav and sweet fennel seeds, for about a 
quarter of an hour ; then take it oflfthe Are, slice in t&ree ounces of 
garlic, and cover it closely up. As soon as it becomes cold, the li- 
quor must be strained and expressed ; and mixed, by the heat of a 
water bath, with a pound and a quarter of clarified honey, to a pro^ 
per syrupy consistence. A tea-spoonful or two of this oxymel, taken 
occasionally, particularly night and morning, will scarcely ever fail 
of proving beneficial to all persons afflicted with an asthma. It is also 
frequently serviceable in rheumatic complaints, especially when as^ 
sisted by warm embrocations. 

The Honourable Mr. Charles Hamilton's Method of making 
Grape fVines, fully equal to Champaign and Old Hock^Jrom 
the Pruit ofhts beautiful Vineyard at Pain's Hill, in Surry^ 
England. 

Ths vineyard belonging to Pain's HiH, one of the finest country 
residences in the united kingdom, is situated on the south side of 
a gentle hill, the soil being gravelly sand. It is planted entirely witi 
two sorts' of Burgundy grapes : tbe Avemat, which is the most de- 
licate and tender ; aild the miller's grape, originally so named frooi 
the powdered whiteftess on the leaves in the spring, called in Eng- 
land the Black cluster or Burgundy grape. We shall give, in the 
Honourable Mr. Hamilton'^s own words, his valuable account of (he 
process pursued, and its successful efiect : " The first year I attempt- 
ed to make wine in the usual way, by treading the grapes ; then let- 
ting them ferment in the vat till all the husks and impurities formed 
a thick crust at the top, the boiling ceased, and the clear wine was 
drawn off from the bottom. This essay did hot answer. The wine 
was so very harsh and austere, that I despaired of ever making red 
wine fit to drink ; but, through that harshness, I perceived a flavour 
something like that of small French white wines, which made me 
hope 1 should succeed better with white wine. That experiment 
succeeded far beyond my most sanguine expectations, for, the very 
first year I made white wine, h nearly resembled the flavour of 
Champaign ; and, in two or three years more, as the wine grew stron- 
ger, to mj great amazement, my wine had a finer flavour than the 
best Champaign I ever tasted. The first running was as clear aa 
spirits ; the second running was'oeikle per drix, or partridge-eye co- 
lour { and both sparkled and creamed in the glass like Champaign. 
It would be endless to mention how many good judges of wine were 
^ deceived by my wine, and thought it superior to any Champaign they, 
had ever drank. Even the Duke de Mirepoix preferred it to any 
other wine. But, such is the prejudice of some people against any 
Ihing of English growth, I generally found it most prudent not to de 
clare where it grew till after they passed their verdict on it» IW 



SECEIPT-BOOC.

Burest proof I cao give of its excellence is, that I have sold it to wine 
merchants for fifty guineas a hogshead ; and one wine merchant, to 
whom I sold five hundred pounds worth at one time, assured me he 
sold some of the best of it from seven shillings and sixpence to ten 
fihilUngs per bottle. After many years experience, the best method 
r found of managing it was this : I let the grapes hang, till they had 
got all the maturity the season would give them ; then they were 
carefully cut oJOT with scissors, and bronght home to the wine barn 
in small quantities to prevent their breaking or pressing one another. 
Then, they were all picked off the staiks, and all the mouldering or 
green ones discarded, before they were committed to the press ; 
where they were'^U pressed in a few hours after they were gathered. 
Much would run from them, bef<!>re the press squeezed them, from 
their own weight on one another. This running was as clear as 
water, and as sweet as syrup ; and all of the first pressing, and part 
of the second, continued white : the other pressings grew reddish, 
and were not mixed with the best. As fast as the juice run from the 
press into a large receiver, it was put into the hogsheads, and closely 
banged up. In a few hours, one would hear the fermentation begin ; 
which would soon burst the casks, if not guarded again by hooping 
them strongly with iron, and securing them in strong wooden 
frames, and the heads with wedges. In the height of the fermen- 
tation, I have frfaquently seen the wine oozing through the pores of 
the ^taves. These hogsheads were left all the depth of winter 
in the cold barn, to have jthe benefit of the frost. When the fermen- 
tation was over, which was easily discovered by the cessation of the 
noise and oozing, (b«Jt, to be more certain, the pegging the cask 
showed when it would be quite clear,) then it was racked off into 
clean hogsheads, and carried to the vaults, before any warmth' of 
weather could raise a second fermentation. In March the^hogsheads 
were examined. If they were not quite fine, they were fined down 
with common fish glue or isinglass, in the usual manner ; those 
which were fine of themselves were not fined down. All were bot- 
tled about the end of March ; and, in about six weeks more, would 
be in perfect order for drinking, and would be in their prime for above 
one year : but, the second year, the flavour would abate ^ and Would 
gradually decline, till it lost all flavour and sweetness. Some, 
that I kept sixteen years, became so like Old Hock, that it nright 
pass for such to one who was not a perfect connoisseur. ' The only 
art I ever used to it was, patting three ponhds of white sugar-candy 
to some of the hogsheads, when the wine was first tunned from the * 
press ; in order to conform to a rage that prevailed, to drink none bat ' 
very sweet Champaign.*' In the astonishing success of this pro- 
cess, we see demonstrated how little assistance from art is required 
by nature, provided that little be judiciously applied.

several other uses, is prepared by boiling any quantity of flax-seed 
in a sufficient quantity of water, till the whole substance be extract-

boiling down the liquor to the consistence of a jelly. This is to i)e 
kept in a close vessel ; and, for preservation, to have a little strong

ever, be preserved witfa bittersi The printer, in using this substitute, 
may either put a certain quantity into a gaHon of colour, according 
to the nature of it, and the particular kind of work to be done, and 
regulate himself by trial, as is common in using gum, or reduce the 
substitute by boiling it in water to the consistence that may be fbimd 
requisite.

The celebrated Tour of Mrs. Guthrie, in Taurida, oc.the Criin^ • 
comnlonly called Grim Tartary, which was made by that iady; in 17^,. 
and 1796, furnishes the particulars of this interesting article. In ^ 
the city of Earasubazar, Mrs. Guthrie informs us, there is an anqevL^'^ 
manufactory of Morocco leather, where great quantity are* prep^^'^ 
with the skins of the numerous flocks of Tauric goats. Tne process

' are macerated for ten days in cold lime water, to loosen the hair, 
which is likewise scraped oflTas clean as possible. Being then soak- 
ed in cold common water for fifleen days, they are trod or worked 
under foot in a succession of fresh waters ; lilU at lengtli, an admix- 
ture of dog's dung being added^ they receive a second scraping, and 
are drained of their humidity. They next proceed to what they do- 
nominate feeding the skins, by steeping them four days in a cold io- 
fasion of wheat bran ; and then in a decoction of twenty-eight pounds 
of honey to five pails of water, cooled to the temperature of milk 
from the cow. AQer renMiining thus steeped the same period, they 
are put into a vessel with holes at the bottom, and pressed till all the 
liquid has escaped. Lastly, they are steeped, for another four days 
in a slight solution of salt and water, one pound only to five pails, 
when the leather is quite ready for the reception of the dye* A 
strong decoction of Artemisa annua, or southernwood, in the pro* 
portion of four poaods to ten pails of water, seems to be the basis 
of all the different colours which ^y gii% to the Morocco io the 
Taurida, Aatracan, and the other cities formerly belonging to the 
Turkish empire, where the sceret has till now remained. When a 
t-ed colour is required, one pound of powdered eoohineial is graduaUr 
stirred iiito ten pails of the fine yeUow deeoetion of Arterotaa, with 
t\e or SIX dracbois of alum spread on the leather, in a proper ves 
sel. They are next worked under foot, in an infusion of oak leaves 
in warm water, till they become supple and soft ; when they are 
finished, by being rinsed in cold water, rabbed over with olive oil, 
and calendered with wooden rollers. Yellow Morocco leather is dyed 
with a stonger decoction of Artemisa, twenty pounds to fifteen pails 
of waler ; nothing being added, but two pounds of powdered alura, 
which is gradually introduced, by half a table spoonful at a time. 
Each skin is twice stoned, previously to the final operations of oil- 
ing and calendering. It is also neceamry to remark, that the skins 
are prepared inasomewhati different modefdr the yellow Morocco 
leather, than for the red. Neither, honey nor salt is used ; but, in-^ 
stead of the decoction of honey, immediately after the skins are 
taken out of tbe wheat bran infusion, they are steeped two days in 
an infusion of oak leaves : after which, they are next rinsed in cold 
water, and- thus' made ready for staining yellow. Mrs. Guthrie can-* 
didly aokno#ledges, that the above is all the certain information 
which she has been able to obtain on this curious subject ; 'as she 
could by no. meftns dopend on the vague reports which she fand heard 
relative to the colouring matter added for staining the green and blue 
kiods. It may, however, be presumed, that the light, which tbis 
lady has thrb^tionthe process of dying Morocco leather in ge- 
nenil, will sufiiciently guide our manufacturers to a judicious search 
after those particular but inferior objects, which yet remain undis- 
covered.

Purified Syrup cf Molutsei. 
In many parts of the contkient of £urope, a method has for some 
vears b^en successfully practised) on a large scale, of divesling mo- 
lasses, vulgarly called treacle, of its peouhar ma^vkjcih and unplea- ^ 
saot taste, so as to render it, for many purposes, little less useiiil 
^ and pleasant than sugar. Indeed, unless it be for cordials mixed 
with spices, or in domestic dishes wiiere miUc is ah ingredient, it may 
very generally be substituted for sugar. The process for thus pre* 
paring it is sufficiently simple, and by no means expensive : Boil 
twelve pounds of molasses, with three pounds »£ coarsely- pounded 
charcoal, in six quarts of water, over a slow fire. After the mixture 
has-been, stirred together, and simmered for at least half an. hour, 
decant it into a deep vessel ; and,, when the charcoal has subsided, 
poM^r off the liquid, and again place it over the fire, that the super- 
fluous water may evaporate, and restore the syrup to about its ori- 
ginal consistence. Thus refined, it will produce twelve pounds of a 
niild and good syrup, proper for use in many articles of food, &c. 

Art of preparing a fine Red Lake from Dutch Madder. 

The use of madder, in dying a fine red colour, and also as a first 
tint for several other shades, has long rendered it famous among 
dyers ; and, by the following process, it will afibrd a permanent lake 
«f a fine red, applicable to every purpose of painting : Dissolve two 
ounces ^the purest alum in three quarts of distilled water previously 
boiled in a clean glased vessel, and again set over the fire. TVith- 
araw the solution as soon as it begins to simmer, and add to it two 
ounces of the best Dutch madder; then, boiling it up once or twice, 
remove it from the fire, and filter it through clean white paper. Let 
the liquor thus filtered stand all night to subside; and, next day, 
pour die clear fluid into the glazed vessel, heat it over the fire, and 
gradually add a strained solution of salt of tartar, till the madder be 
•vhoUy precipitated. The mixture must now be agam filtered, and 
foiling distilled water be poured on the red powder ttM l4ie fiuid no' 
«onger obtains a saline taste. Nothing more is miw necessary, but 
^ dry the lakej which will be of a deep red colour. If two parts of 
madder be used to one of alum, the shade will be still deeper ; and, 
if one part of the latter article be added to four parte of the former, a 
beautiful rose colour will be p30t^>«eed.

EffUacy of Y^unt in the Cure ofPuind Diseases, 
The following account of the Reverend Mr. Cart Wright's firat 

^ discovery, and subsequent experience, of the good efiects of ad- 
ministering yeast in putrid sore throats, fevers, &c. cannot be too 
generally made known : — " Several years ago,*^ says this gentleman, 
for we shall transcribe verbatim his own highly interesting narrative, 

, ** I went to reside at Brampton, a very populous village near Ches- 
terfield. I had not beeti there many months before a putrid fever broke 
out among us ; and, finding by far the greater number of my new 
parishioners much too poor to afford themselves medical assistance, 
1 undertook, by the help of such books on the subject of medicine 
as were in ray possession, to prescribe for them. I early attended a 
boy about fourteen years of age, who was attacked by this fever ; he 
had not been ill many days, before the symptoms were unequivocally 
putrid. I then administered bark, wine, and such other remedies as 
my books directed. My exertions, however, were of no avail : his 

^ disorder grew every day more untractable and malignant, so that 1^ 
was m hourly expectation of his dis3olution. Being under the abso- 
lute necessity of taking a journey, before I set off I went to see him, 
as 1 thought for the last time ; and I prepared h(s parents for the 
event of his death, which I considered as inevitable ; reconciling 
them, in the best manner I was able, to a loss which I knew they ' 
would feel severely. While I was in -conversation oo this distressing 
subject with his" mother, I observed, in a corner of the room, a small 
tub of wort working. The sight brought to my recollection an ex- 
periment I had somewhere met with, of a piece of putrid meat ' 
being made sweet by suspending it over a tub of wort in the act of 
fermentation. The idea instantly flashed into my mind, that th«) 
yeast might correct the putrid nature of this disease : and I instantly 
gave him two large spoonsful, telling the mother, if she fbupd her 
son better, to repeat this dose every three hours. I then set out on 
my journey. On my return, after a few days, I anxiously inquired 
about the boy, and was informed he had recovered. I could not re- 
press my curiosity. Though I was greatly fatigued with my journey, 
and night was come oh, I went directly to where he lived ; which ■ 
was three miles off, in a wild part of the moors. The boy himself 
opened the door ; looked surprisingly well ; and told me, that he'- 
felt better from the instant he took the yeast. After I left Brampton, 
I lived in Leicestershire ; and, my parishioners being there few and 
opulent, I dropped entirely my medical character, and would not , 
even prescribe for any of my own family. One of iny domestics 
falling ill, accordingly the apothecafy was sent for. The Vcirvant's 
Complaint was a violent fever ; which, in its progress, became putrid. 
Having great reliance, and deservedly, on the apothecary*s penetra- ; 
tion and judgment, the man was left solely to his management.'^ His 
disorder^ however, kept daily gaining ground: till, at length, the ' 
apothecary considered him in very great danger. At last; finding' '' 
every effort to be of service to him baffled, he told me, he consi- 
dered it as a lost case ; for, in his opimon, the man could ndtsurviv# *^

nim in the last stage of* a putrid fever ; his tongue was black t his 
pulse was scarcely per,ceptible ; and he lay stretqbed out, like a 
corpse, in a slate of drowsy insensibility, f i)»niedi.at^iy procured 
some yeast ; which I diluted with watei:^ mi poured down his throat. 
I then left him, with little hope of his. recovery. I retumod to him. 
in about two hours ; and found him sensible, and able to converse. 
I then gave him sr dose of bark. He aflerward took« at a proper, 
interval, some selreshment, I continued with him till he repeated the 
yeast ; and then leA him, with directions how to proc|B<^d. . I called 
on him the next morning at nine o'clock, and found him. apparently 
wetly walking in his garden^ He was an old man,; upwards of seventy. 
I have, sinee, administered the yeast to above fifty persona labour- 
ing under putrid fevers ;> and, what is singular, I have not lost one 
patient." Dr. Thornton^ whose opportunities: ht^ve been gre^at, as 
Buperbtending phy^i^ian of thck General Dispensary, including the 
poor of nine parishes in Loudon^ has made frequent trials of yeast.

admirable basis for cement. The scrapings are- often used 'for ordii^

not more than one part lime to three of scrapings. Thismoi:tar, ofless

•Ancient British lAquor^ called Bragget. 

This oaee fimiotts <4d British liquor is still made by a few respec- 
table families, chiefly in Wales ; from one of which we heve he^i 
favoured with an admirable method of preparing it. The /original 
Welsh name is bragod ; from which has been formed that of bragget, 
or braggot, for it is found both ways in the few old dictionaries and 
other books where it occurs, and simply defined as a dri^ eoneisl- 
ing of ^ney and spices. Were this correct, k*could only be con^ 
sidered as the W^sh appellation of mead or metheglin ; but, accord- 
ing to our information, bragget implies a combination of malt hquor 
with honey and spices, the best method of preparing which is as fol- 
lows : Take after the rate of a gallon of wat^ to a pound of honey, 
and stir it till the honey be melted. Then, adding half a handful 
each of roseoEiary tops, bay-leaves, sweet briar, angelica, balm, 
thyme, or other sweet herbs, with half an ounce of sliced ^nger, 
and a little nutmeg, mace, cinnamon, and a few cloven, boil tbem 
gently together fornearly half an hour ; scumming it well, till it looks 
tolerably clear. In the mean time, having prepared three gallcMw of 
the first runnings of strong ale, or sweet wort, mix the two liquids ipiite 
hot, with all the herbs and spices ; and, stirring tbem together for 
some time over a fire, but without suffering them to boil, stvain off 
the liquor, and set it to cooL When it becomes only the warmth of 
new milk, ferment it with good ale yeast ; and, after it has properly 
worked, tun it up, and hang a bag of bruised spices in the barrel, 
where it is to remain all the time of drawing. It is generally drank 
from the cask ; but may be bottled, like othe^ liquors, any time after 
it has entirely ceased to hiss in the barrel. A weaker sort of brag- 
get is sometimes prepared with the third runnings of the ale, a smal- 
ler proportion of honey, and the strained spices, &c. with a few fresh 
herbs ; the second runnings, in that case, being made the family ale. 
These arrangements, however, and other obvious deviations, are 
made according to the taste or inclination of the respective parties.

TraiiflietioQB of that jetr it is thus regularly described : Take raw 
potatoes, in the state they are taken out of* the earth. Wash them 
well : then rub them on a grater, over a vessel of clean water, to i 
fine pulp ; pass the liquid matter, through a coarse sieve, into anothei 
tub of clear water ; let the mixture stand, till the fine white par 
tides of the potatoes are precipitated ; then pour the mucilaginous 
liquor from the fecula, and preserve this liquor for use. The article 
to be cleaned should be laid, on a linen cloth, on a table : and, having 
provided a clean sponge, dip the sponge in the potato liquor, and 
apply the sponge thus wet on the article to be cleaned ; and rub it 
well on widi repeated portions of the potato liquor, till the dirt is 
perfectly separaded. Then wash the article id chean wat«r several 
times, to remove the loose dirt, it may, afterward, be smeolftied o 
dried. Two middle sized potatoes will be sulBGient foe a pint of 
water. The white fecula, which separates in making the mucilagi- 
nous liquor, will answer the purpose of tapioca : it will make a use- 
ful and nourishing food with soup or milk, or serve to make starch 
and hair powder. The coarse pulp, which does not pi^ss the sieve, 
is of great use in cleaning worsted curtains, tapestry, carpets, or 
other coarse goods^ The mucilaginous liquor of the potatoes will 
clean all sorts of silk, cotton, or woollen goods, without damaging 
the texture of the article or spoiling the colour. It is also useful in 
cleaning oil paintings, or furniture that is soiled. Dirty painted 
* wainscots may be cleaned by wetting a sponge in the liquor, then 
dipping it in a little fine clean sand, and afterward rubbing the wains- 
cot therewith. Various experiments were made by Mrs. Morris, in 
the presence of a committee, at the society's house ; and the whole 
process, on fine and coarse goods of different fabrics, was perform- 
ed to their entire satisfaction. This simple but very valuable dis- 
covery ma^ certainly be applied to many other useful purposes, as 
well as those which are here particularly enumerated. 

JVw method of Clearing Feathers from their Animal OH. 

The process for effecting this useful purpose, is thus described in 
the Transactions of the Adelpbi Society, who rewarded Mrs. Rich- 
ardson with a premium of twenty guineas for making the discovery : 
Take for every gallon of clear water, a pound of quick lime. Mix 
them well together ; and, when the undissolved lime is precipitated 
in fine powder, pour off the clear lime-water for use, at the time it is 
wanted. Put the feathers to be cleaned in another t^b, and add to 
them a sufficient quantity of the clear lime-water to cover the fea- 
thers about three inches when well immersed and stirred therein. The 
feathers, when thoroughly moistened, will sink dowi ; and should re-« 
main in the lime-water three or lour days : afler which, the foul liquor 
should be separated from the feathers, by laying them on a sieve. The 
feathers should be afterward well washed in dlean water, and dried 
on nets, the meshes being about the same firmness as those of cab- 
bage nets. The feathers must, from time to time, be shaken on ihe 
nets ; axid, a« they dry, they will fall through the meshes, and are to 
b» oaBfDQted for use. Tbe^ adnsissioa of air will be serviceable in tbe^

drying, and the whole process may be completed in about three weeks* 
The fathers, after being thus prepared, will want nothing more \han 
beating for use, either as beds, bolsters, pillows, or cushions. So 
efTectual is this method, and so preferable to the old and common 
way of stoving or baking, that an eminent dealer having sent to the 
society some bags of foreign feathers, which retained their unplea- 
sant smell after having been stoved the usual period of three days, 
Mrs. Richardson rendered them perfectly sweet and clean. ' This is 
a very important discovery ; more particularly as the feathers, by not 
being hardened with heat, certainly require less beating. 

Mr, Seboitian GrandVt Restoration wr Discovery «f the old 
Venetian Art of preparing Grounds for Painting on Pan-- 
ndsj Copper^ or Canvas^ fy? 

This ingenious gentleman, having long had the honour of being 
employed by the most eminent professors of the fine arts in Italy 
and England, and assisted and improved the processes ofpreparing 
canvases and the pannels, seems to have discovered, as far as ex- 
perience can prove, the manner of preparing either canvas, copper, 
or pannel, in the old Venetian stile ; an art which has been long lost, 
and to which it is well known that Titian, Paul Yeronese, Bassani, 
and other Venetian masters, owed much of the peculiar harmony, 
brightness, and durability, of their beautiful productions. Mr. Grandi, 
having communicated, for the public benefit, his entire process of 
thus preparing pannels, canvas, &c. for artists ; and also made 
other valuable communications wi(h regard to the preparation of oils, 
colours, crayons, &c. for painting and drawing ; was rewarded by 
the Honourable Society in the Adelphi for the encouragement of 
Arts, &c. with their elegant and honourary silver medal, as well as 
a pecuniary premium of twenty guineas. These, therefore, in per- 
fect concert with the design of that liberal and truly patriotic institu- 
tion, we shall contribute all in our power to make more generally 
known. Mr. Grandi's method of preparing pannels and canvases 
for painters is thus described : Break, grossly, the bones of sheep's 
trotters, and boil them in water till they are cleared from their grease , 
then putting them into a crucible, calcine them, and aflerward grind 
them to powder. Dry some wheaten flour in a pan, over a 6low fire ; 
then make it into a thin paste, adding an equal quantity of the pul- 
verized bone ashes, and grind the whole mass well together. This 
mixture forms the ground for the pannel. When the pannel has been 
well pumiced, some of the mixture or ground is to be well rubbed 
on a pumice stone, that it may be incorporated with the pannel : 
another coat of the composition is next applied, with a brush on the 
pannel, where it is suffered to dry, the surface being afterward rubbed 
over with sand paper. A thin coat of the composition is then ap* 
plied with a brush ; and, if a coloured ground be required, a coat or 
two more must be added, so as to complete the absorbent grouhd. 
When a pannel thus prepared is wanted to be painted on, it must be 
rubbed over with^ coat of raw linseed or poppy oil, as drying oil 
would destroy the absorbent.quaUty of the grotind ; and the paffitet** -

a thin coat of the composition, and aflerward drying and pumicing 
them ; then giving them a second coat, and, lastly, a coat of colour- 
ing matter along with the composition. The grounds thus prepared 
do not crack : they may be painted in a very short time afler being 
laid ; and, from their absorbent quality, allow the business to be pro- 
ceeded in with greater facility and better effect than with those pre- 
pared in the usual mode. These valuable qualities have been suf^ 
ficiently ascertained, and are liberally avowed, by Sir William Beecfay 
and other Royal Academicians, whose names are added to Mr.

Method of Purifying the OH for ni^in^ up Colours. 

Hakb some of the bone-ashes into paste with a l^tie water, so as 
to form a mass or balL Put this ball into the fire, and make it red 
hot; then immerse it, for an hour, in a quantity of raw linseed pi] 
sufficient to cover it. 'When cold, pour the oil into bottles ; add to 
it a little of the bone-ashes ; let it stand to settle ; and, in a single 
•da^y it wiH be clear, and fit for use. 

Preparation of White, Brown, Yellow, Red, Gray, and Blue 
Black Colours, which never Change, and may be used either ^ 
. in Oil or fVnier* 

WnitE is mclde by calcining the .bones of sheep's trotters in'fi 
eleai' open fire, till they become a perfect white, which will never 
change. Brown is made from bones in a sitnilar manner, only cal- 
cining from them in a crucible instead of an open fire. Yellow, or 
masticot, by burning a piece of sofl brick of ayellowisbcolour in the 
fire ; grinding a quarter of a pound of flake white with every pound 
oft>rick: calcining them, as well as grinding them, together ; and, 
afterward, washing the mixture to separate the sand, and letting the 
finer part gradually dry for use. Red, equal in beauty to Indian red, 
by calcining some of the pyrites usuaHy found in coal pits*. Gray, 
by calcining together blue slat^ and bone ashes pdwdered, grinding 
them together, washing the texAire, arid gradually drying it. Blub 
Black, by bttrhing vine stalks within a clo^e crucible and iii a sloW 
fire, till they become a perfect charcoal, which madt be well ground 
for use. * 

Superior Crayons, of Permanent Colours ^ to be applied either 
in Water or Oil. 

Thesis crayons, produced also by Mr. Grandi, are of a quality 
superior to any heretofore in use ; they are fixed, so as to prevent 
their rubbing off the paper when used, and may be applied in water or 
oil. This process of preparing the crayons is thus described : — They 
are*made of bone-ash powder mixed with spermaceti, adding the co- 
louring matters. The proper proportion is^ three ounces of sperma- 
ceti to a poand of the powder ; the spermaceti to be first dissolved 
IB ft pini of boiling water ; then the white bone-ashes added ; and ih^

grinding the respective oelouriag matters with bone-ac^>es. These 

. several conunuaicatioos, relative to the preparation of groondsf oil, 
colours, crayons, and chalks, for paintats, were inosi respectabljr

good qualities of the pannels prepared hy Mr. Graodi, and geoemUy 
recommend his colours as useful and permanent* The nuUenaJs 
are certainly extremely cheap, as well as easy to be pfooKired^ and 
none of the processes for -preparation are at all difficult. . 

Syrup of Damask Mo$^. 

The Edinburgh Dispensatory describes syrup of damask roses as 
an agreeable and mild purgative for children, in dos^ of firpm half 
to a whole table spoonful. It likewise mentions, tha^t this syrbp 
proves gently laxative to adults ; and, with that intentiooi may be of 
service to costive habits. The method of preparing it| according tQ 
the London practice, Is as follows : — Take seven ounces of the dried 
petals of the damask rose, six pounds of double- refined sugar, and 
four pints of boiling distilled water. Macerate the roses, in ^e wa- 
ter for twelve hours, and then strain. Cvaporate the strained liquor 
to two pints and a half | and add the sugar, that it may be made a 
syrup. In the Edinburgh practice, it is prepared thus :<-7-Take one 
pound of the fresh petals of the damask rose, four pounds of boiling 
Water, and three pouxKls of double^ refined sugar. Macerate the 
roses i^ the water for twelve hours ; then> to the. strain? d inf^siooy 
add the sugar, and boU tbein to a sy^up in the usual manner, as di« 
rected for syrup of clove gillyflowers, &c.

fforo thejsyrup pf damask roses y bieingT considered as mildly astrin- 
gent, instead of gently laxative.. It peems> however^ prmcipally 
valued on account of its beautiful red. colour. The manner of pre- 
paring it is almost the same as the London method' of making the 
syrup of damask roses, called simply syrup of roses : — Take seven 
ounces of the dried petals of red roses, six pounds of double-refined 
sugar, and five pounds of boiling water. Macerate the roses in the

A curious and useful Glue!" 

Take an ounce of isinglass, beat it jLo shreds^ and put it into a 
pint of brandy ; when gradually dissolved, wUcb it soon us miii« 
gentle heat, strain the solution through a piece of fine ivualin, and 
the glue will be obtained, which is to be kept in a glass deeely atop 
ped. On being dissolved^ in a moderate beat, it is thiB, iransparebt^ 
and aln^ost limpid. When used in the manner of oommon glue, it 
joins together the parts of v^ood stronger than die wood itself is 
united : so that the pieces thus joined will break in a^y other |yaft 
sooner than where diey are glued together. . It is also reraarl»bltt, 
that, if saw-dust, or powdered wocfed, be made into a baH with this 
glue, the ball will prove solid and elastic ; so that it may be tamed 
and used as a bowl, without breaking. As the glue thus made vriHk 
brandy will keep long without corrupting, it is by no means an ink- 
proper form to preserve isinglass ready dissolved, for fining wines 
. and odier purposes. Another use of this^urious ghie is, diat of ks 
serving exceUendy for taking off impressioips of medab or ooins^ 
thus, if a little of it, when melted, b^ poured thiidy on anew, guinea, 
&;c. so as to cover the whole surface of the piece, an^i sufiened so to 
remain a day or two, till it become thoroughly dry, it will appear ha^ 
and trani^parent, like a piece of Muscovy glass, with the impression 
of the guinea in intaglio, as it is denominated, on one side, and in 
relievo on the other. This glue dries into a very etrongi tou^ and 
transparent substance ; not easily damaged bj^ ^ny thing but equepus 
moisture, which would soon dissolve it. This last reason renders it 
tinfit for any use where it would be much exposed to wet or damp 
air. Gomcpon glue, dissolved with linseed oil, is admirably calcu- 
lated to stand the weather ; a secret little known by those who would 
be most benefited by its adoption.

juice of these oranges and lemons into the brandy ; an4 ad4 three 



pjnta of nun, three pints mpm of hxwuiff aad bUl pmt9 of water. 

trrate a natmeg into two quarts of milk ; and, having) made it boil- 
ing hot, poiur it into the above ingredients, carefully keeping th^ 
whole well stirred till completely mixed ; then add two pounds of 
fine loaf sugar, which must also be well stirred. Let the punch thus 
made stand twelve hours, then strain it through a flannel bag till it 
appear perfectly bright It may, probably, require to be three or 
four times strained, according to the fineness or coarseness of the 
sugar, and other circumstances. ' When quite clear, this charming 
liquor is immediately fit to drink ; or will keep, if bottled, any length 
of time, and in all climates. 

jlrt of making the Curious Sympathetic Ink* 

This, carious ink has been long known in the world ; but the mnn* 
ner of preparing it, and means of proottfiiig the materials, as describe 
ed in various chemical books, rendered the task too discouraging to 
be often attempted. By the following easy method, however, it is 
readily accomplishable : — ^Take an ounce and a half of zafTre, which 
may be obtained at any colour-shop, «nd put it into a glass vessel* 
with a narrow and long neck, pouring over it an ounce measure of 
strongmitfous acid, diluted with five times tke quantity of water. 
Keep it in a warm situation, but not too hot, for about ten or twelve 
hours, and tiien decant the clearest part of the liquor* Having so 
done, pour nearly as much more diluted nitrons acid on the remain- 
der : which is to continue in the same situation, and for as long a time 
as before, and then b^ decanted and mixed with what was obtained 
by the first operation. This being done, diseelve in it two ounceH of 
common salt, and the sympatbetie ink is coo^iietely made* The 
property of this ink is, that the wiitto^ made with it, on cominon pa<* 
' per, is legible only while the paper is hoi and dry ; so that, by ex- 
posing it, alternately, to the ambient air, and to tbe heat of a fire or 
burning sun, whatever is written may be twused to appear and dis- 
appear at pleasure. The universal knowledge of this seeret rather 
diminishes than increases the security of guilt in using it for any im* 
proper purpose; since detection is certain, from the nxmient suspicion 
takes plaoe, by akofly holding every letter or other doubtful paper to 
ihe fire, or in the warm rays of the sun. 

Soft Sealing Wax^ for LnpreHimg Seah of Offiee, ^c* 

This sealing wax, which is seldom used for any other purpose 
than that of receiving the impressions of sea!s of ofiice to charters, 
patents, proceedings in chancery, &c. is prepared, when to be used 
white, or rather uncoloured, by mixing half a pound of bees' wax, an 
oance and a half of turpentine, and half an ounce of sweet oil ; and 
carefully boiling them together, till the compound becomes of a fit 
consistency for moulding iiSto rolls, cakes, or balls, for use. If colour 
be wanted, it is readily obtained by stirring into the melted mass 
about half an ounce of a proper pigment, as in making the red ot 
other coloured hard sealing wax» ~

TiTts useful article of domestic economy nighl e^Uy he made •■ 
ffre jpoKt>re£t families : — To every (juart of spring w^ter put % qiM»tM' 
of a pound of the coarsest sugar ; boil them together* ai^ ke«f> «kiai^ 
trnng the liquor as long as any scum rises. After pouriag it inlo « 
tub or other Vessel, let it fitaod till cool enough to work ; and tbea 
phic9 id it a toast spread with yeast, of a size propoftioo^d to ih% 
iiaantity made. Let it ferment a day or two ; then beat the yeast 
krto it, i^ut it into acag or barrel with a piece of tile or slatQ over the 
btuig-hole, and place it in a situation where it may best receive the 
heat of the sun. Make it in March, or the beginning of April, and 
it will be fit for use in July or August If not sour enough, which 
can seldom happen when properly managed, let it stand a month 
linger before it be bottledl ofl It may be \t^^ in stone or glass bot- 
tles. During the tioie ef making) It must never be disturbed, afler 
the first week or fen days; and thet^gh, i n very fhie weather, the 
bung-hole weuld be best left open a^ day, as it rtC^i be fatal to 
leave it open a single night, or exposed to any sudden rain, the great- 
est c«u]tion will in that case be neeessary. Prevjonsiy to its being 
bottled, it may be drawn off into e fresh cask ; add, if it fill a large 
barrel, a handful of shred isinglass may be thrown iu, or less in pro- 
portion to the quantity t this, after it has stood a few days, Will ren- 
der the viaegar fine, when it may be drawn c^, or bottled, for use* 
' This sugar vinegar, though very strong, may be used in pi<^k1mg for 
sea-store or exportation^ without being at all towered ; but for pick- 
les to be eaten in ikigland it wtM heat mixing with at least an equal 
quantity of oold spring water. There are few picMesl^f which this 
vinegar need ever be boiled. Without beiting, it will keep Walnuts very 
finely, even for the East or West Indies ; but then, as Remarked in* 
general of pickles for foseign use, k niust be tinmixed With wateh If 
niMch vinegar he wade^ so as to require expensive casks, the out-' 
sides «h9u)d aiwajrs be peiated, for the sake of preserving ttiem from 
the in9iittioe;uf ihe weather^ dnring so maiiy months of ^jtposure to 
sun and rain* 

Esbcettent Embrocution for the ^Qojfifkg-jppvgt. 

All the dreadful consequences of the chin or hooping dough, 
and its commonly tedious dtmtiotii may he dbwate# tttie shoHlened 
by the following admirable remedy :-^Mix well fogethiSr half an 
ouncp ef ch of spirit of harts)iom and oil of amber { With which plen- 
tifully anoint the palms of the hands, the pit of (he stomach, the soles 
of the feet, the arm-pits, and the back bone, every mornii:^ and even- 
ing for a month, suflfering no water to come near the parts thus an- 
ointed, though the fingers and backs of the hands niay be wiped with 
a damp doth. It should be rpbbed in near the fire^ and care naturally 
i»ed to prevent afterwards taking cold. It is best to make only the 
aboee quantity at a time ; because, by frequently opening the bo^e, 
nnieh of the virtue will be lost. It should, by rights, be kept in a 
glass-stopper bottle. Indeed, the hartshorn is always thus kept by 



iSne faeiilty ; Mid wliete klbrnss'so lai^ « part of the mixture, the 
Becessity of preventing its effluvia from escaping is eqiiiiHy great* 
These precautions taken, and the other directions followed, its u«b 
wMI seldom fail to be attended with the most complete success; 
fi^ueutly in a much shorter time than it is judged prudent to ad* 
vise it^ bemg ctotinued, as it can never possibly do the smallest 
injury even to the tenderest infants. 

Sj^eedy Cwrt for a Sprain* 

Take a large spoonful of honey, the same quantity of salt, and 
the white of an egg : beat the whole, up together incessantly for 
two hours ; then let it stand an hour, and anoint the place sprained 
with the oil which will. (}e produ/^ed, keeping the part well rolled 
'With a good bandage. This is^^ said generally to have enabled per- 
sons vt^ith grained ankles,, freqi^ently more tediously cured than 
even a broken limb, and often leaving a perpetual weakness in the 
joint, to walk in twenty-four hpur^jpntiicely free from pain. 

Singt^r and $itnple manner of preserving Apples from the 
effects 6f frost in jSTorth America. 

Apples being projduced almost abundantly in North Americ^,- 
|i[nd for,ming ap article of chief necessity in almost every family, the 
greatest care . fs constantly taken to protect, them from frost at . 
. the earliest commencement of the winter sieason ; it being well 
Icnown, that apples, if left unprotected, are inevitably destroyed by 
the first frost which occurs. This desirable object, during their 
lon^ and seyere^winters^ is said to be completely effected, by only 
tbrowingover them a thin4iQen clath befpre the approach of frost, 
vben the fruit is never injured^ how severe soever the winter may 
Eiappen to prove. Yet apples are there , usually .kept in a small 
apartment, immediately beneatli the roof of the house, which is par-* 
ticularly apj^ropriated to tha^ purpose, and where there is never any 
fire. . irhis is a fact so well known, thtu; the Americans are. astonish- 
ed it should appear at all wonderful : and they have some reason to 
be so, when it is considered that, throughout Germany, the same 
method of preserving fruit is universally practised.^ from whence 
probably it made its way to North America. It appears that linen 
cloth only is used for this purpose ; woollen cloth, in particular, 
having been experienced to prove inefiectual. There seems abun- 
dant reason to believe, that even potatoes, might be protected from 
frost by some such simple expedient. This, also, like the preced- 
ing article, to which the principle seems so very analogous, merits 
high consideration; and for the same important reason, its capa« 
bility of conducing to the universal benefit of tiiankind, and the nu- 
merous animals under our protection. 

Cure for Chilblains*

enough entirely to cover the ulcer, tie it on with warm cloths over 
the part af^cted; and renew the dressings everv jpriorning an4

worn before the first approach' of winter^ iii, October at f^rth^si, and 
never suffbred to get wet or hard, will generally preserve frwri ctiil- 
blains even those who are most stihject to be troubled ViK^h t^^nGl.
