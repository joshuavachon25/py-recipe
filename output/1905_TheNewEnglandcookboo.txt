Did it ever occur to You 

When considering the fuel question, 
that there is 

COAL and COAL ? 

Have you used that discrimination in buying 

that has brought the best results and smallest 

coal bills ? 

We buy directly from the producers, and in 

such large quantities that we are enabled to 

select those dealing only in first quality coal. 

With our perfect organization for handling 

our business, we can deliver all orders 

promptly. 

If you do not trade with us now, why not 

give us a trial ?

COLLEGE SONGS 
AND GLEES 

WITH WORDS AND MUSIC 

As sung at Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Princeton and 
other Leading Colleges. 




NOTHING makes a home more charm- 
ing than music ; nothing inspires men 
to greater achievements than music. It is 
indispensable to a successful life ; and is 
the greater creator of human happiness. 
The songs in vogue at America's greatest 
seats of learning are the songs that appeal 
to the good taste of the general public, and 
we intend distributing at a nominal cost 
the best collection of these merriment 
makers ever compiled, together with the 

COLLEGE CHEEJjS 

AND SUCH POPULAR 
SONGS AS 



Oh, That Will Be Joyful Rig-a-Rig 

Nellie Was A Lady 
Fair Harvard Mary Had A Little Lamb 

Bingo Good Night, Ladies 

Old Dog Tray Saw My Leg Off 

Three Little Darkies 
Upidee Jack and Jill, etc. 



Parties receiving a copy of the " New England Cook Book" 
(Published at One Dollar and a Half) through the courtesy of 
the Metropolitan Coal Company will be favored with one 
copy of " College Songs and Glees" at the special price of 
10 cents. Address orders with stamps or coin to 
CHARLES E. BROWN, 47 WINTER ST., BOSTON, MASS. 



Trade Follows the Flag ? 

And the reason is not hard to find in our 
case. The people know that if they order 
their coal where they see this sign, it will be 
right.

Oh! better no doubt is a dinner of herbs, 
When season'd by love, which no rancor disturbs, 
And sweeten' d by all that is sweetest in life 
Than turbot, bisque, ortolans, eaten In strife! 
But if out of humor, and hungry, alone 
A man should sit down to dinner, eacn one 
Of the dishes of which the cook chooses to spoil 
"With a horrible mixture of garlic and oil, 
The chances are ten against one, I must own, 
He gets up as ill-tempered as when he sat down. 

Owen Meredith. 



Cleanliness in the Kitchen 

Is an important requisite if you 
wish to obtain the best results in 
cooking. Is it not just as impor- 
tant that your COAL should be 
clean ? 

Our coal is clean, and is housed 
by careful men, with as little annoy- 
ance to the customer as possible. 
In fact, it is what you want, when 
you want it, and as you want it.

FOREWORD. 



IN no department of industry has the last century 
brought greater changes than in the department of 
housekeeping. Then, the housekeeper was at the 
head of, and the principal worker in, a manufacturing 
plant in which was made nearly everything used by the 
family. The housewife made with her own hands the 
candles for lighting and the soap for cleaning. The 
flax was taken as it came from the field and the wool as 
it came from the sheep, and all the processes of spin- 
ning, weaving, knitting, bleaching, dyeing and making 
the cloth into clothes for all the members of the family, 
and the linen for the table or bed, were carried on by 
the women of the household. Then the housekeeper 
took the grain as it came from the field and the fruit as 
it came from the vine and tree, and attended to all the 
steps by which it was converted into food. 

To-day all this is changed. While food has still to 
undergo some measure of preparation within the house- 
hold, and while there are still a sufficiency of duties for 
the housekeeper, the work has been greatly simplified 
and made easier by the invention of many labor-saving 
devices, appliances and processes. 

In a civilized community the position of housekeeper 
will always be first in importance to the well-being of 
the family, and the duties of the housekeeper are com- 
ing more and more to be the spending of a definite 
amount of money for a great variety of ready-prepared 



30 THE HOUSEWIFE'S I.IBRARY. 

articles, the most successful housekeeper being the one 
who can spend the money to the greatest advantage. 

Competition is daily becoming more strenuous and 
the claims of manufacturers and dealers more pictur- 
esque. The unscrupulous will adulterate their goods 
and sell an. inferior article for the sake of the. larger 
profit, and it is of the greatest importance to the house- 
keeper to know what are standard goods and where 
they can be obtained. The housekeeper who is led to 
spend money for inferior goods, or to deal with irre- 
sponsible concerns, lowers the standard of living of the 
whole family. 

For this reason the publishers of The New England 
Cook Book have introduced a department of " Sup- 
plies, Furnishings, etc.,' 7 which is a feature never before 
attempted. We have investigated the claims of manu- 
facturers of and dealers in goods that are used by the 
housewife or the members of the family, and, having 
satisfied ourselves as to the excellence of the goods 
offered and the reliability of the manufacturers and 
dealers, we have allowed them to state in their own way 
their claims for recognition. 

We can assure the readers of The New England 
Cook Book that the articles here described are of the 
highest quality as to material and manufacture, that the 
individuals and firms here represented are of unques- 
tioned reliability, and that the use of the goods here 
described, or the patronage of the houses referred to, 
will insure the certainty of getting the very best that the 
market affords.

I.— THE ART OF COOKING. 

THERE is a science and there is an art of cooking. The 
science tells what should be done and why ; the art takes 
held and does the thing, without, in most cases, knowing 
any reason why certain methods produce certain results. 
The one is theoretical, the other practical ; the one deals 
with principles, the other with performances. 

The science of cookery proceeds on the basis that man 
needs certain elements of repair and growth for the various 
tissues of his body, that these elements exist in nature in 
various forms, and that the mission of the cook is so to 
prepare these suitable substances that man may receive 
them in their most enjoyable and assimilable forms, and thus 
have his waste repaired and his growth provided for. This 
basis is solid. On it the whole culinary system is founded 
But, from the merely utilitarian idea of repairing waste and 
supplying force, cookery rises to the supreme height ol 
exquisitely delighting the taste while doing its most impor- 
tant work of feeding the body. Indeed, the art of cooking 
well, and of serving well-cooked victuals well, is " a fine art " 
in the best sense of the term. There are artistes in 
this line. Meals may be served artistically. They may 
become a delight to the most refined natures and a real 
benefaction to both body and soul. 

The great aim of all cooking is to retain all the valuable 
elements of the food, and to put them into such forms as 
shall awake desire, stimulate digestion, and secure to the 
eater, in the readiest and most pleasing way, all the nutriment 
these viands afford. For instance, in cooking meats it is 
desirable to retain all the natural juices. To this end, when 
meat is to be boiled it should be plunged into hot water, 
which at once renders the outer part measurably impenetra- 



34 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

ble, ana so confines the juices. On the other hand, if the 
juices are to be drawn out for the production of soup, it 
must be placed in cold water, and gradually warmed and 
slowly boiled, so as to allow the exudation of the juices. 
On the same principle, broiling and roasting, by quickly clos- 
ing the surface of the meat, retain the juices as well as the 
odors, and make the meat both juicy and savory. The re- 
tention of the fatty substances renders such preparations 
somewhat less digestible, however, than boiled food or lean 
meat. 

High art in cookety, as elsewhere, demands high rates of 
expenditure. Instructions on that grade alone would not 
meet the want of American homes. But high aims in this 
department are equally commendable with high aims else- 
where. So important a factor in domestic economy as cook- 
ing cannot be ignored and should not be treated lightly. 
Good food, well cooked and well served, goes far to make 
home happy and its inmates healthy. 

The chemical aspect of food and cooking may be left to 
the chemist and the physiologist. They will perfect the 
scientific aspects of the case. But the art of cooking, which 
teaches just how and when to do the right things, is for us 
to learn and to practice day by day. Such is the relation of 
stomach and brain on the one side, and of stomach and 
cook on the other side, that the cook becomes the sov- 
ereign, to whom many a brain mightier than his own 
bows in servile allegiance. 

What cookery was practiced in the garden of Eden his- 
tory does not tell. Vegetarians insist that permission to 
eat animal food was not given until after the flood (Genesis 
xi, 3, 4), when, by indulgence, man's appetites had become 
abnormal. If vegetable food only were used in Eden, and 
that mainly of the nature of fruits, but little cooking was 
needed, and the simplest forms would suffice amply.

n.— SOUP STOCK, SOUPS, ETC. 

GENERAL SUGGESTIONS ON SOUP STOCK AND SOUP MEAT, HOW 
TO PREPARE THEM, HOW TO ENRICH THEM, THICKENING SOUP, 
COLORING SOUP, FLAVORING SOUP, ETC. THIRTY-FIVE RECIPES 
FOR SOUPS AND INCIDENTAL PREPARATIONS. 

THE first and great essential to making good soup is 
stock, or good, fresh meat. To make stock, take the 
liquor left after boiling fresh meat, bones large or 
small, the large ones being cracked, that the marrow may 
be extracted, trimmings of meat, bones, and meat left over 
/rom a roast or broil, put any or all of these in a large pot 
or soup-kettle with water enough to cover them. Let them 
simmer slowly over a steady fire, keep the kettle covered, 
stir frequently, pour in now and then a cup of cold water, 
and skim off the scum. If it is fresh meat or bones, com- 
mence with cold water ; if cooked, with warm water. Bones 
are as useful as meat in making stock, as they furnish gela- 
tine. A quart of water is usually enough for a pound of 
meat. Six to eight hours will make stock fit for use. Let 
it stand over night, then skim off the fat, put the stock into 
an earthen jar, and it is ready for use. 

Fresh meat should be freed from all superfluous skin and 
fat, which make a soup greasy, rather than rich. 
. The glutinous substance contained in the bones renders it 
important that they should be boiled with the meat, as they 
add to the strength and thickness of the soup. The meat, 
however, should be cut off the bone and divided into small 
pieces. Place in cold water over a gentle fire and boil by 
the long and slow process, that the essence of the meat may 

35 



86 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

be drawn out thoroughly. When it comes to the boiling 
point, throw in a little salt to assist the scum to rise ; then 
skim carefully to prevent its becoming turbid. When no 
more scum accumulates, and the meat is softened so as to 
readily separate with the use of the fork, it should be 
strained, the vegetables put it, the seasoning done, and the 
necessary amount of hot water added if too much has boiled 
away. 

All soup meats are better boiled the day before using, so 
as to allow the grease to chill over night, when it can 
readily be removed before putting over the fire again. 

The following thickening is almost indispensable to all 
good soups : A tablespoonful or more of flour mixed to a 
smooth paste with a little water, and enriched with a tea- 
spoonful of butter, or good beef drippings well stirred in. 
If it be necessary to add water to a soup, always use boil- 
ing water, as cold water injures the flavor. If making a 
rich soup that requires catsup or wine, let either be added 
just before the soup is taken from the fire. 

Soup may be colored yellow by the use of grated car- 
rots ; 'red with the juice of tomatoes ; green with the juice 
of powdered spinach ; brown with carefully scorched flour, 
Jkept ready for use. Onions are thought by many to be a 
necessity in all soups— that their flavor must lurk some- 
where, either defined or undefined. Their flavor may be 
much improved if fried until nicely browned in hot butter 
before being added to the soup. Potatoes should never 
be boiled with soup, because they add nothing to its flavor 
and are themselves injured by the long cooking.. They 
should be boiled separately, and then added. 

A most desirable quality in soup is that no one flavor 
predominate over the others, but, that by a careful blending 
of the different ingredients it shall contain and harmonize 
all flavors. Soups and broths should always be strained. It. 



SOUP STOCK, SOUPS, ETC. 37 

makes them more relishable as well as inviting to the eye. 
A slight acid, like lemon or tomato, gives a peculiar 
relish to some soups, as do many of the palatable condi- 
ments prepared by such manufacturers as Skilton & 
Foote Co., D. & L. Slade Co., and several others, for 
this especial purpose. With such helps and a suffi- 
cient quantity of stock on hand, a choice, rich soup of 
any variety may be gotten up in thirty minutes. 



RECIPES. 

Beef Soup. — Boil a shin of beef, or a piece off the shoulder, 
slowly and thoroughly, the day before desiring to use it ; 
skim well the next day and thin the jelly, if necessary, with 
water ; add a little brandy, a grated carrot, two tablespoon- 
fuls of butter rubbed smooth in brown flour, a little vermi- 
celli, and spices to taste. Two or three eggs may be boiled 
hard, mashed smooth, and placed in the tureen before 
turning in the soup. « 

Beef Soup, No. 2. — Boil a shin of beef of moderate size, 
crack the bone, remove the tough outside skin, wash, and 
place in a kettle to boil with six or eight quarts of water. 
Let it boil about four hours, until it becomes perfectly 
tender, then take it out of the liquid. Add salt, one pint of 
tomatoes, two onions cut in small pieces, two turnips cut in 
quarters, one grated carrot, one large tablespoonful of sugar, 
a little sweet marjoram and thyme rubbed fine, one red 
pepper cut in very small pieces, also a celery top or a small 
quantity of bruised celery seed. This soup may be thick- 
ened according to taste either with vermicelli, macaroni, 
noodles, or drop dumplings. 

For an incidental side dish, take the soup meat that has 
been cut from the bones, chop fine while warm, season with 
salt and pepper, add one teacup of soup saved out before

putting in the vegetables. Pack in a dish, and slice down 
for tea or lunch when cold. 

Beef Soup with OkTa. — Cut a round steak in small pieces 
and fry in three tablespoonfuls of butter, together with one 
sliced onion, until very brown ; put into a soup kettle with 
four quarts of cold water, and boil slowly an hour ; add 
salt, pepper, and one pint of sliced okra, and simmer three 
and one-half hours longer. Strain before serving. 

Corned Beef Soup. — When the liquor in which corned beef 
and vegetables have been boiled is cold, remove all the 
grease that has risen and hardened on the top, and add 
tomatoes and tomato catsup and boil half an hour — thus 
making an excellent tomato soup ; or add to it rice, or sago, 
or pearl barley, or turn it into a vegetable soup by boiling in 
the liquor any vegetables that are fancied. Several varieties 
of soups may have this stock for a basis and be agreeable 
to the taste. 

Ox-tail Soup. — Chop the ox-tail into small pieces ; set on 
the fire with a tablespoonful of butter, and stir until brown, 
and then pour off the fat ; add broth to taste, and boil gently 
until the pieces of tail are well cooked. Season with pepper, 
salt, and three or four tomatoes ; boil fifteen minutes and 
then serve. This soup can be made with water, instead of 
the stock broth, in which case season with carrot, onion, 
turnip, and parsley. 

Mutton Broth. — After the steaks have been cut from the 
leg, the lower part is just adapted for a soup. The neck- 
piece is also very nice. Boil the meat very gently in cold 
water, adding a turnip, a carrot, and a spoonful of rice. All 
the fat should be removed. Toward the last, add a little 
minced parsley. Dumplings are an excellent addition. 

Vegetable Soup. — Take two pounds of shin of beef and two 
pounds of knuckle of veal ; remove all the fat and break 



SO UP STOCK, SOUPS, ETC. 39 

the bones and take out the marrow ; put into a pot with five 
pints of water ; add a teaspoonful of salt, and then cover and 
let it come to a boil quickly ; remove the scum that rises, 
and set where it will simmer for five'hours ; one hour before 
serving, add two young carrots, scraped and cut in slices, 
half a head of celery, and a small onion cut into squares ; in 
half an hour add one turnip sliced, and in fifteen minutes 
one cauliflower broken in small pieces. 

Bean Soup. — Soak one and a half pints of beans in cold 
water over night. In the morning drain off the water, wash 
the beans in fresh water, and put into soup-kettle with four 
quarts of good beef stock, from which all the fat has been 
removed. Set it where it will boil slowly but steadily for 
three hours at the least. Two hours before it is needed for 
use, slice in an onion and a carrot. Some think it im- 
proved by adding a little tomato. If the beans are not liked 
whole, strain through a colander and send to the table hot. 

Black Bean Soup. — Three pounds soup bone, one quart 
black beans, soaked over night and drained ; one onion, 
chopped fine ; juice of one lemon. Pepper, salt, and Durkee's 
Challenge Sauce to taste. Boil the soup bone, beans, and 
onions together six hours ; strain, and add seasoning. Slice 
lemon and put on top when served. 

Tomato Soup. — Take a knuckle of veal, a bony piece of 
beef, a neck of mutton, or almost any piece of meat you 
may happen to have ; set it over the fire in a small quantity 
of water, cover it closely, and boil very gently, to extract 
the juices of the meat. When nearly done, add a quantity 
Of peeled tomatoes, and stew till the tomatoes are done ; add 
salt and pepper to your taste. This is a very cheap, healthful, 
and easily made soup. 

Tomato Soup, No. 2. — Take one quart of tomatoes. When 
boiling, add one teaspoonful of soda, two pulverized soda 



40 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

crackers, one pint of hot water, one pint of milk, salt, and 
pepper ; strain through a colander and serve hot. 

Green Pea Soup. — Boil the empty pods of a half-peck of 
green peas in one gallon of water one hour ; strain them 
out ; add four pounds of beef cut into small pieces, and boil 
slowly for an hour and a half longer. Half an hour before 
serving add the shelled peas, and twenty minutes later half 
a cup of rice flour, salt, pepper, and a little chopped parsley. 
After adding the rice flour stir frequently so as to pre- 
vent scorching. 

Dried Split Pea Soup. — One gallon of water, one quart of 
soaked split peas, half a pound of salt pork, one pound of 
beef. Put over the fire, seasoning with salt and pepper, 
celery salt, salpicant, curry powder, marjoram, or savory ; 
let it boil slowly for two hours, or until the quantity of 
liquor does not exceed two quarts'. Pour into a colander 
and press the peas through with- a spoon. Fry two or three 
slices of stale bread in butter till brown, scatter, them in the 
soup after it is placed in the tureen. 

Corn Soup. — Cut the corn from the cob, and to a pint of 
corn allow one quart of hot water ; boil an hour and press 
through a colander; put into a saucepan an ounce of but- 
ter and a tablespoonful of flour, being careful to stir well to 
prevent it being lumpy; then add the corn pulp, a little 
cayenne pepper, salt, a pint of boiling milk, and half a pint 
of cream. 

Onion Soup. — Slice ten medium-sized onions and fry brown 
in butter with a tablespoonful and a half of flour ; put into a 
saucepan, and stir in slowly four or five pints of milk and 
water (about one-third water) ; season to taste, and add a 
teacupful of grated potato ; set in a kettle of boiling water, 
and cook ten minutes ; add a cup of sweet cream and serve 
quickly. 



SOUP STOCK, SOUPS, ETC. 41 

Mock-turtle Soup. — Scald a calf's head and wash it clean ; 
boil it in a large pot of water for half an hour, cut all the 
skin off, and take the tongue out. Take the broth made of 
a knuckle of veal, put in the tongue and skin, with one 
onion, half-ounce of cloves, half-ounce of mace, half a nut- 
meg, all kinds of sweet herbs chopped fine, and three 
anchovies. Stew till tender ; then take out the meat, and 
cut it in pieces two inches square; cut the tongue, previously 
skinned, in slices ; strain the liquor through a sieve ; melt 
half a pound of butter in a stewpan ; put in it half a pound 
of flour and stir it till smooth — if at all lumpy, strain it ; add 
the liquor, stirring it all the time ; then put to the meat the 
juice of two lemons, or one bottle of Madeira wine, if pre- 
ferred ; season rather highly with pepper, salt, and cayenne 
pepper ; put in a few meat balls and eight eggs boiled hard. 
Stew gently one hour, and serve in a tureen ; if too thick, 
add more liquor before stewing the last time. 

Mock-turtle Soup. No. 2. — Take a calf's head and about 
two pounds of delicate fat pork. Put both into a soup- 
kettle, with two onions, sweet herbs, celery, pepper, and 
mace. Fill the kettle with water, and boil very gently till 
the meat is tender. Take out the head and the pork, return 
the bones of the head into the soup ; let it stew several 
hours longer ; and, when cold, take off the fat, strain the 
soup, and thicken; add the juice of a lemon and half a pint 
of white wine. Cut up the head and pork into pieces ; warm 
them up in the soup, adding some choice meat balls made 
from finely minced, savory meat. The pork will be found 
quite an addition to the soup and a substitute for the fat of 
the turtle. 

Gumbo Soup. — Cut up two chickens, two slices of ham, and 
two onions into dice ; flour them, and fry the whole to a 
light brown ; then fill the frying-pan with boiling water, stir 



42 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

it a few minutes, and turn the whole into a saucepan con- 
taining three quarts of boiling water ; let it boil forty min- 
utes, removing the scum. In the meantime soak three pods 
of okra in cold water twenty minutes ; cut them into thin 
slices, and add to the other ingredients ; let it boil one hour 
and a half. Add a quart of canned tomatoes and a cupful 
of boiled rice half an hour before serving. 

Southern Gumbo Soup. — Cut up one chicken, and fry it to 
a light brown, also two slices of bacon ; pour on them three 
quarts of boiling water ; add one onion and some sweet 
herbs tied in a bag ; simmer them gently three hours and a 
half; strain off the liquor, take off the fat, and then put the 
ham and chicken (cut into small pieces) into the liquor; 
add half a teacup of sliced okra, also half a teacup of boiled 
rice. Boil all half an hour, and just before serving add a 
glass of wine and a dozen oysters with their juice. 

Julienne Soup. — Scrape two carrots and two turnips, and 
cut in pieces an inch long ; cut slices lengthwise about one- 
eighth of an inch thick; then cut again, so as to make 
square strips ; put them in a saucepan, with two ounces of 
butter, three tablespoonfuls of cabbage chopped fine, and 
half an onion chopped ; set on the fire and stir until half 
fried ; add broth as you wish to make thick or thin ; boil 
until done ; salt to taste ; skim off the fat, and serve ; it 
takes about two hours to prepare this soup properly. It 
can be served with rice or barley. 

Macaroni or Vermicelli Soup. — Two small carrots, four 
onions, two turnips, two cloves, one tablespoonful salt, pep- 
per to taste. Herbs — marjoram, parsley, and thyme. Put 
any cooked or uncooked meat and its bones in enough water 
to cover them; when they boil, skim them and add the 
vegetables. Simmer three or four hours, then strain 
through a colander and put back in the saucepan to reheat. 



SOUP STOCK, SOUPS, ETC. 43 

Boil one-half pound macaroni until quite tender, and place 
in the soup tureen, and pour the soup over it — the last 
thing. Vermicelli will need to be soaked a short time only — 
not to be boiled. 

White Soup. — Boil a knuckle of veal for three hours. Add 
a quarter of a pound of macaroni, and when done, a pint of 
cream. Season with lemon-peel and mace. 

Turkey Soup. — Take the turkey bones and boil three- 
quarters of an hour in water enough to cover them ; add a 
little summer savory and celery chopped fine. Just before 
serving, thicken with a little browned flour, and season 
with pepper, salt, and a small piece of butter. 

Chickeu Soup. — To the broth in which chickens have been 
boiled for salad, etc., add one onion and eight or ten 
tomatoes ; season with pepper and salt ; add Challenge Sauce 
or Salpicant, if desired ; boil thirty minutes ; add two well- 
beaten eggs just before sending to the table. 

Lobster Soup. — To boil a lobster, put it in a fish-kettle and 
cover it with cold water, cooking it on a quick fire. Remove 
the small bladder found near the head, and take out a small 
vein found immediately under the shell all along the back 
of the lobster, and use the rest. Two lobsters will make 
soup for six or eight persons, and salad also. All the under 
shell and small claws are pounded in a mortar to make the 
soup ; when pounded, put it into a pan and set it on the fire 
with broth or water. The meat is cut in small pieces, to 
be added afterward. The soup is left on the fire to boil 
gently for half an hour ; then put it in a sieve and press it 
with a masher to extract the juice. To make it thicker, a 
small piece of parsnip can be added and mashed with the 
rest into a pan, so that all the essence is extracted in that way 
from the lobsjter. When you have strained it put a little 



44 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

butter with it and add as much broth as is required ; put 
some of the meat in the tureen and pour the soup over it. 

Clam Soup. — Wash the clams free from grit; boil them in 
a pint of water till they will come from the shells easily. 
Take a small quantity of the liquor, add some milk, thicken 
it with a little flour, and add the clams. Split crackers are 
very nice added. 

Portable Soup. — Boil a knuckle of veal, also the feet, a 
shin of beef, a cowheel or any other bones of meat which 
will produce a stiff jelly, in a large kettle, with as much 
water as will cover them. Let it stand a long time over the 
fire before it boils. Skim it most thoroughly, until the 
broth appears entirely clear. Then fill up the kettle with 
hot water, and boil it eight hours, or until it has evaporated 
so as to be somewhat thick. Run it through a hair sieve, 
set it in a cool place where it will harden very quickly. Skim 
off every particle of fat, and return it to a saucepan ; skim 
and stir continually, so that it may not scorch, and all the 
previous labor be lost, until it becomes a very thick syrup. 
As soon as it can be no longer done in this way, transfer it 
to a deep jar, and set into a kettle of water, hot, but not 
boiling, until it jellies very thick. This will keep good 
many months, if packed dry in tin canisters. This is the con- 
centrated essence of soup, and is a most convenient article 
of use, either at home in an emergency or in traveling, and 
especially at sea. To make a pint of soup, cut off a piece 
as large as a walnut, dissolve it in the boiling water, and it 
is ready for use. 

Fluid Beef. — Among the advanced preparations of the day 
meat extracts are taking a high place. One of the finest of 
these preparations is " Armour's Fluid Beef." It contains 
all the nutritive constituents of the beef, and is readily 
available for soups, sandwiches, beef tea, etc. For medi- 
cal uses, traveling, picnics, etc„ it is very convenient. To 



SOUP STOCK, SOUPS, ETC. 4S 

use for soups and beef tea, add a teaspoonful to a cup of 
boiling water and season to taste ; or as a sandwich paste, 
it may be used on toast, with or without butter. Put up 
in cans of various sizes, from two, ounces to one pound, 
which can be left open without injury to contents. 

RECIPES INCIDENTAL TO SOUPS. 

Meat Balls for Soup. — Take fresh cooked meat or fowl and 
chop fine ; season with pepper, salt, and herbs, and a little 
lemon ; mix together with an egg ; roll in bread-crumbs, 
and fry in hot lard. 

Browned Flour for Soups. — Dredge the bottom of a spider 
well with flour, and shake it over hot coals, letting it brown 
gradually, but not burn. Keep it in a dry place, in a tin 
canister, without wholly closing the lid. It is very con- 
venient to have it already prepared, although when used fresh 
it is much nicer. 

Home-made Noodles — a substitute for Vermicelli. — Wet with 
the yelks of four eggs as much fine, dry, sifted flour as will 
make them into a firm but very smooth paste. Roll it out 
as thin as possible, and cut it into bands of about an inch 
and a quarter in width. Dust them lightly with flour, and 
place four of them one upon the other. Cut them in the 
finest possible strips, separate them with the point of a 
knife, and spread them on the pie-board so that they may 
dry a little before they are used. Drop them gradually into 
the boiling soup, and in five minutes they will be done. 

Drop Dumplings. — Take prepared flour, add a little beef 
drippings or lard, well rubbed through, and moisten to a soft 
dough. With floured hands pinch off very small pieces and 
form into balls by rolling in the palm of the hand. In boil- 
ing dumplings of any kind, put them in the water one at a 
time. If they are put in together they will blend with each 
other. 



46 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Clamcakes. — Fried bread crumbs for soups are pre- 
pared in this way : Cut slices of stale home-made bread 
half an inch thick, trim off all crust, and cut each slice 
into squares ; fry these in very hot fat ; drain them on a 
clean napkin, and add six or eight to each portion of 
soup. — Thomas J. Murrey. 

Marrow Dumplings for Soups. — Grate the crust of a 
breakfast roll, and break the remainder into crumbs ; 
soak these in cold milk ; drain, and add two ounces of 
flour; chop up half a pound of beef-marrow freed 
from skin and sinews ; beat up the yolks of five eggs ; 
mix all together thoroughly, if too moist add some of 
the grated crumbs ; salt and pepper to taste ; form into 
small round dumplings ; boil them in the soup for half 
an hour before serving. — Thomas J. Murrey. 

Potage a la Reine. — Remove the fat from one quart of 
the water in which a chicken has been boiled. Season 
highly with salt, pepper and celery-salt, and a little 
onion if desired, and put on to boil. Mash the yolks of 
three hard-boiled eggs fine, and mix them with half a 
cup of bread or cracker crumbs soaked until soft in a 
little milk. Chop the white meat of the chicken until 
fine like meal, and stir it into the egg and bread paste. 
Add one pint of hot cream slowly, and then rub all into 
the hot chicken liquor. Boil five minutes, add more 
salt if needed, and if too thick add more cream, or if 
not thick enough add more fine cracker-dust. It should 
be like a puree. — The Boston Cook Book: Mrs. D. 
A. Lincoln. Roberts Brothers, Publishers.

HINTS CONCERNING FISH — HOW TO DRESS, HOW TO BOIL FISH, 
HOW TO BAKE FISH, HOW TO BROIL FISH, HOW TO FRY FISH, 
ETC. FIFTY-THREE RECIPES FOR COOKING FISH, OYSTERS, ETC.] 
AND FOR INCIDENTAL PREPARATIONS. 



RECIPES. 

Broiled Shad. — Scrape, split, wash, and dry the shad on a 
cloth; season with pepper and salt; grease the gridiron 
well ; as soon as it is hot lay the shad on to broil with the 
inside downward. One side being well browned, turn it. 
It should broil a quarter of an hour or more, according to 
thickness. Butter well and send to table hot. 

Baked Shad. — Many people are of the opinion that the 
very best method of cooking a shad is to bake it. Stuff it 
with bread-crumbs, salt, pepper, butter, and parsley, and 
mix this up with beaten yelk of egg ; fill the fish with it, 
and sew it up or fasten a string around it. Pour over it a 
little water and some butter, and bake as you would a fowl. 
A shad will require from an hour to an hour and a quarter 
to bake. 

Halibut Cutlets. — Cut your halibut steaks an inch thick, 
wipe them with a dry cloth, and season with salt and cay- 
enne pepper. Have ready a pan of yelk of eggs well 
beaten and a dish of grated bread-crumbs. Put some fresh 



48 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

lard or beef drippings in a frying-pan and hold it over the 
fire till it boils. Dip your cutlets in the egg, and then in 
the bread-crumbs. Fry a light brown; serve up hot. 
Salmon or any large fish may be fried in the same manner. 

Baked Cod or Halibut. — Use a piece of fish from the middle 
of the back, weighing four, five, or six pounds. Lay the fish 
in very cold salt-and-water for two hours ; wipe dry ; make 
deep gashes in both sides at right angles with the back- 
bone, and rub into these, as well as coat it all over with, a 
force-meat made of the crumbs, pork, herbs, onion, and 
seasoning, made to adhere by raw egg. Lay in the baking- 
pan and pour over it the drawn butter (which should be quite 
thin), season with the anchovy sauce, lemon juice, pepper, 
and a pinch of parsley. Bake in a moderate oven nearly an 
hour — or even more if the piece be large — basting frequently 
lest it should brown too fast. Add a little butter-and-water 
when the sauce thickens too much. When the fish is done, 
remove to a hot dish, and strain the gravy over it. A few 
capers or chopped green pickles are a pleasant addition to 
the gravy. 

Boiled Halibut. — Take a small halibut, or what you require 
from a large fish. Put it into the fish-kettle, with the back 
of the fish undermost ; cover it with cold water, in which a 
handful of salt and a bit of saltpetre the size of a hazel-nut 
have been dissolved. When it begins to boil skim it care- 
fully, and then let it just simmer till it is done. Four pounds 
of fish will require half an hour nearly to boil it. Drain it, 
garnish with horse-radish or parsley. Egg sauce, or plain 
melted butter, are served with it. 

Boiled Rockfish. — After the fish has been nicely cleaned, 
put it into a pot with water enough to cover it, and throw 
in salt in the proportion of half a teaspoonful to a pound of 
fish. Boil it slowly until the meat is tender and easily sep- 



ffSff, OYSTERS, ETC. 49 

arates from the bones. A large fish will require an hour to 
cook. When done, serve on a hot dish, and have a few 
hard-boiled eggs, cut in thin slices, laid around it and over 
it. Eat with egg-sauce. 

White Fish, — This fish may be broiled, fried, or baked. 
To bake it, prepare a stuffing of fine bread-crumbs, a little 
salt pork chopped very fine ; season with sage, parsley, pep- 
per, and salt. Fill the fish with the stuffing, sew it up, 
sprinkle the outside with salt, pepper, and flour, and bake. 
In frying white fish, pour off the fat as it accumulates, as it 
is apt to be too fat when served. 

Broiled Salmon. — The steaks from the centre of the fish 
are best. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, spread on a little 
butter, and broil over a clear but slow fire. 

Smoked Salmon, Broiled. — Take a half pound of smoked 
salmon and parboil it ten minutes ; lay in cold water for the 
same length of time ; wipe dry and broil over a clear fire. 
Add two tablespoonfuls of butter while hot ; season with 
cayenne and the juice of half a lemon; pile in a "log- 
cabin " square upon a hot plate, and serve with dry toast. 

Boiled Salmon. — A piece weighing six pounds should be 
rubbed with salt, tied carefully in a cloth, and boiled slowly 
for three-quarters of an hour. It should be eaten with egg or 
caper sauce. If any remain after dinner, it may be placed 
in a deep dish, a little salt sprinkled over, and a teacupful of 
boiling vinegar poured upon it. Cover it closely, and it will 
make a nice breakfast dish. 

Baked Salmon with Cream Sance. — Butter a sheet of fools- 
cap paper on both sides, and wrap the fish up in it, pinning 
the ends securely together. Lay in the baking-pan, and 
pour six or seven spoonfuls of butter-and-water over it. 
Turn another pan over all, and steam in a moderate oven

50 THE HOUSEWIFE 'S LIBRARY. 

from three-quarters of an nour to an hour, lifting the cover, 
from time to time, to baste and assure yourself that the 
paper is not burning. Meanwhile, have ready in a sauce- 
pan a cup of cream, in which you would do well to dis- 
solve a bit of soda a little larger than a pea. This is a wise 
precaution whenever cream is to be boiled. Heat this in a 
vessel placed within another of hot water ; thicken with a 
heaping teaspoonful of corn-starch ; add a tablespoonful of 
r utter, pepper and salt to taste, a liberal pinch of minced 
parsley, and when the fish is unwrapped and dished, pour 
half the dressing slowly over it, sending the rest to table 
in a boat. If you have no cream, use milk, and add a beaten 
egg to the thickening. 

Salmon Steaks or Cutlets Pried. — Cut slices from the middle 
of the fish one inch thick ; wipe dry, and salt slightly ; dip 
in egg, then in cracker crumbs ; fry very quickly in hot 
butter ; drain off every drop of grease, and serve upon a hot 
dish. Sprinkle green parsley in bunches over it. The 
French use the best salad-oil in this recipe instead of butter. 

Pickled Salmon. — Soak salt salmon twenty-four hours, 
changing the water frequently ; afterward pour boiling water 
around it, and let it stand fifteen minutes ; drain off and 
then pour on boiling vinegar with cloves and mace added. 

Pried Perch. — Scale and clean them perfectly ; dry them 
well, flour and fry them in boiling lard. Serve plenty of 
fried parsley round them. 

Pried Trout. — Wash, drain, and split ; roll in flour, season 
with salt ; have some thin slices of salt pork in a pan, and 
when very hot put in the fish and fry to a nice brown. 

Stewed Trout — Clean and wash the fish with care, and 
wipe it perfectly dry ; put into a stewpan two tablespoonfuls 
ot butter, dredge in as it melts a little flour, grate half a 



FISH, OYSTEKS, ETC. 51 

nutmeg, a few blades of mace, a little cayenne, and a tea- 
spoonful of salt ; mix it all together ; then lay in the fish, let 
it brown slightly; pour over some veal gravy, a lemon 
thinly sliced ; stew very slowly for forty minutes ; take out 
the fish, and add two glasses of wine to the gravy. Lay 
the fish on a hot dish, and pour over it some of the gravy. 
Serve the rest in a sauce-tureen. 

Fried Catfish. — Catfish must be cooked quite fresh — if pos- 
sible, directly out of the water. The larger ones are gener- 
ally coarse and strong; the small-sized fish are the best. 
Wash and clean them, cut oft" their heads and tails, remove 
the upper part of the backbone near the shoulders, and 
score them along the back with deep gashes or incisions. 
Dredge them with flour, and fry them in plenty of lard, 
boiling fast when the catfish are put into the pan. Or you 
may fry them in the drippings or gravy saved from roast 
beef or veal. They are very nice dipped in a batter of 
beaten egg and grated bread-crumbs, or they may be done 
plain, though not in so nice a way, with Indian meal instead 
of bread-crumbs. Drain off the lard before you dish them. 
Touch each incision or cut very slightly with a little cay- 
enne before they go to table. 

Fried Eels. — After skinning, emptying, and washing them 
as clean as possible, cut them into short pieces, and dry 
them well with a soft cloth. Season them with fine salt 
and cayenne, flour them thickly, and fry them in boiling 
lard ; when nicely browned, drain and dry them, and send 
to the table with plain melted butter and a lemon, or with 
fish-sauce. Eels are sometimes dipped into batter and then 
fried, or into egg and dried bread-crumbs, and served with 
plenty of crisped parsley 

Fish Chowder. — Take a fresh haddock, of three or four 
pounds, clean it well, and cut in pieces of three inches 



62 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

square. Place in the bottom of your dinner-pot five or six 
slices of salt pork, fry brown, then add three onions sliced 
thin, and fry those brown. Remove the kettle from the fire, 
and place on the onions and pork a layer of fish. Sprinkle 
over a little pepper and salt, then a layer of pared and sliced 
potatoes, a layer of fish and potatoes, till the fish is used up. 
Cover with water, and let it boil for half an hour. Pound 
six biscuits or crackers fine as meal, and pour into the pot ; 
and, lastly, add a pint of milk ; let it scald well, and serve. 

New England Chowder. — Take a good haddock, cod, or any 
other solid fish, cut it in pieces three inches square ; put a 
pound of fat, salt pork, cut into strips, into the pot ; set it 
on hot coals and fry out the grease ; take out the pork, but 
leave the grease in the bottom of the pot, and put in a layer 
of fish, over that a layer of sliced onions, over that a layer 
of fish, with slips of the fried pork, then another layer of 
onions and a few sliced raw potatoes, and so on alternately 
until your fish is all in ; mix some flour with as much water 
as will fill the pot ; season to suit your taste, and boil for 
half an hour ; have ready some pilot bread, soaked in water, 
and throw them into your chowder five minutes before tak- 
ing off; serve in a tureen. 

Pish-balls. — Two cupfuls cold boiled codfish, fresh or 
salted. Chop the fish when you have freed it of bones and 
skin ; work in one cupful of mashed potatoes, and moisten 
with a half cup of drawn butter with an egg beaten in. Sea- 
sen t© taste. Have them soft enough to mold, yet firm 
enaugh to keep in shape. Roll the balls in flour, and fry 
quiefely to a golden-brown in lard or clean dripping. Take 
from the fat so soon as they are done ; lay in a colander or 
sieve and shake gently, to free them from every drop of 
grease. Turn out for moment on white paper to absorb any 
lingering drops, and serve on a hot dish.

Lobster Chowder. — Meat of one fine lobster, picked 
out from the shell and cut into bits, one quart of milk, 
six Boston crackers split and buttered, one even tea- 
spoonful of salt, one scant quarter-teaspoonful of cay- 
enne, two tablespoonfuls of butter rolled m one of pre- 
pared flour, a pinch of soda in the milk. Scald the 
milk, and stir in seasoning, butter, and flour, cook one 
minute, add the lobster, and simmer five minutes. Line 
a tureen with the toasted and buttered crackers, dipping 
each quickly in boiling water before putting it in place, 
and pour in the chowder. — Marion Harland. 

Clam Scallops. — Chop fifty clams fine, and drain off 
in a colander all the liquor that will come away. Mix 
this in a bowl with a cupful of crushed crackei , half a 
cupful of milk, two beaten eggs, a tablespoonful melted 
butter, half a teaspoonful of salt, a pinch of mace and 
the same of cayenne pepper. Beat into this the chopped 
clams and fill with the mixture, clam-shells, or the silver 
or stone-china shell-shaped dishes sold for this purpose. 
Bake to a light brown in a quick oven and serve in the 
shells. Serve with sliced lemon. — Marion Harland. 

Little Pigs in Blankets. — Season large oysters with salt 
and pepper. Cut bacon in very thin slices ; wrap an 
oyster in each slice, and fasten with a little wooden 
skewer. Heat a frying-pan and put in the "little 
pigs." Cook just long enough to crisp the bacon. 
Place on slices of toast that have been cut into small 
pieces and serve immediately. Do not remove the 
skewers. This is a nice relish for lunch or tea ; and, 
garnished with parsley, is a pretty one. The pan must 
be very hot before the ' ' pigs " are put in. Great care 
must be taken that they do not burn. — New Cook Book : 
Miss Maria Parloa. Estes & Lauriat, Publishers.

Roasted Oysters. — Take oysters in the shell; wash the 
shells clean, and lay them on hot coals ; when they are done 
they will begin to open. Remove the upper shell, and serve 
the oysters in the lower shell, with a little melted butter 
poured over each, and season to taste. 

Oyster Toast. — Select fifteen plump oysters; mince them, 
and season with mixed pepper and a pinch of nutmeg ; beat 
the yelks of four eggs and mix them with half a pint of 
cream. Put the whole into a saucepan and set it over the 
fire to simmer till thick ; stir it well, and do not let it boil, 
lest it should curdle. Toast five pieces of bread, and butter 
them ; when your dish is near the boiling-point, remove it 
from the fire and pour it over the toast. 

Cream Oysters.— Fifty shell oysters, one quart sweet cream ; 
butter, pepper, and salt to suit taste. Put the cream and 
oysters in separate kettles to heat, the oysters in their own 
liquor, and let them come to a boil; when sufficiently 
cooked, skim ; then take them out of the liquid and put 
them into a dish to keep warm. Put the cream and 
liquid together. Season to taste, and thicken with powdered 
cracker. When sufficiently thick, stir in the oysters. 

Broiled Oysters. — Drain select oysters in a colander. Dip 
them one by one into melted butter, to prevent sticking to 
the gridiron, and place them on a wire gridiron. Broil over 
a clear fire. When nicely browned on both sides, season 
with salt, pepper, and plenty of butter, and lay them on hot 
buttered toast, moistened with a little hot water. Serve 
very hot. Oysters cooked in this way and served on broiled 
beefsteak are delicious. 

Pried Oysters. — Select the largest and finest fresh oysters, 
put them into a colander and pour over a little water to 
rinse them ; then place them on a dean towel and dry them. 
Have ready some grated bread-crumbs seasoned with 



FISH, OYSTERS, ETC. 55 

pepper and salt, and plenty of yelk of egg beaten till very 
light ; and to each egg allow a large teaspoonful of rich 
cream or of the best fresh butter. Beat the egg and cream 
together. Dip each oyster first into the egg and cream, 
and then into the crumbs. Repeat this twice, until the 
oysters are well coated all over. Have ready boiling, in a 
frying-pan, an equal mixture of fresh butter and lard. It 
must very nearly fill the frying-pan, and be boiling fast when 
the oysters go in, otherwise they will be heavy and greasy. 
Fry them of a yellow brown on both sides, and serve hot. 

Oyster Salad, see Salads. 

Spiced or Pickled Oysters. — Put into a porcelain kettle one 
hundred and fifty large oysters with the liquor ; add salt, 
and simmer till the edges roll or curl ; skim them out ; add 
to the liquor one pint of white wine vinegar, one dozen 
blades mace, three dozen cloves, and three dozen pepper- 
corns ; let it come to a boil, and pour over the oysters. 
Serve with slices of lemon floating in saucer. 

Oyster Omelette. — Allow for every six large oysters or 
twelve small ones one egg ; remove the hard part and mince 
the rest very fine ; take the yelks of eight eggs and whites of 
four, beat till very light, then mix in the oysters ; season and 
beat up thoroughly ; put into a skillet a gill of butter, let it 
melt ; when the butter boils, skim it and turn in the ome- 
lette ; stir until it stiffens ; fry light brown ; when the under 
side is brown, turn on to a hot platter. To brown the upper 
side, hold a red-hot shovel over it. 

Scalloped Oysters, No. 1. — Open the shells, setting aside for 
use the deepest ones. Have ready some melted butter, not 
hot, seasoned with minced parsley and pepper. Roll each 
oyster in this, letting it drip as little as may be, and lay in 
the shells,which should be arranged in a baking-pan. Add 



56 THE HO USE WIFE' S LIBRAR Y. 

to each a little lemon juice, sift bread-crumbs over it, and 
bake in a quick oven until done. Serve in the shells. 

Scalloped Oysters, No. 2. — Cover the bottom of a baking- 
dish (well buttered) with a layer of crumbs, and wet these 
with cream, put on spoonful by spoonful. Pepper and salt, 
and strew with minute bits of butter. Next, put in the oys- 
ters, with a little of their liquor. Pepper them, stick bits of 
butter in among them, and cover with dry crumbs until the 
oysters are entirely hidden. Add more pieces of butter, very 
small, and arrange thickly on top. Set in the oven, invert 
a plate over it to keep in the flavor, and bake until the juice 
bubbles up to the top. Remove the cover, and brown on 
the upper grating for two or three minutes. Serve in the 
bake-dish. 

Oyster Pie. — Line a dish with a puff paste or a rich bis- 
cuit paste, and dredge well with flour ; drain one quart of 
oysters ; season with pepper, salt, and butter, and pour into 
the dish ; add some of the liquor ; dredge with flour, and 
cover with a top crust, leaving a small opening in the 
centre. Bake in a quick oven. 

Oyster Patties. — Put one quart of oysters in a saucepan, 
with liquor enough to cover them, set it on the stove and 
let them come to a boil ; skim well, and stir in two table- 
spoonfuls of butter, a little pepper, and salt. Line some 
patty-pans with puff-paste, fill with oysters, cover with paste, 
and bake twenty minutes in a hot oven. The upper crust 
may be omitted, if desired. 

Oyster Macaroni — Boil macaroni in a cloth to keep it 
straight. Put a layer in a dish seasoned with pepper, salt, 
and butter, then a layer of oysters, until the dish is full. 
Mix some grated bread with a beaten egg, spread over the 
top, and bake. 

Qyster Sauce, see Sauces. 



FISff, OYSTERS, ETC. 57 

Boiled Lobster. — If purchased alive, lobsters should be 
chosen by weight (the heaviest are the best) and their live- 
liness and briskness of motion. When freshly boiled they 
are stiff) and their tails turn strongly inward ; when the fish 
appear soft and watery, they are stale. The flesh of the 
male lobster is generally considered of the finest flavor for 
eating, but the hen lobster is preferred for sauce and soups, 
on account of the coral. 

To properly boil lobsters, throw them living into a kettle 
of fast-boiling salt and water, that life may be destroyed in 
an instant. Let them boil for about half an hour. When 
done, take them out of the kettle, wipe them clean, and rub 
the shell with a little salad-oil, which will give a clear red 
appearance. Crack the large claws without mashing them, 
and with a sharp knife split the body and tail from end to 
end. The head, which is never eaten, should also be sepa- 
rated from the body, but laid so near it that the division is 
almost imperceptible. Dress in any way preferred. 

Deviled Lobster. — Procure a live, heavy lobster ; put it in 
a pot of boiling water, with a handful of salt to it. When 
done and cold, take out all the meat carefully, putting the 
fat and coral on separate plates; cut the meat in small 
pieces, rub the coral to a paste ; stir the fat in it, with a little 
salt, cayenne, chopped parsley, essence of anchovies, and 
salad-oil, or melted butter and lemon juice ; cut the back of 
the lobster-shell in two, lengthwise ; wash clean ; stir the 
lobster and sauce well together; fill the shells; sprinkle 
bread-crumbs and a few bits of butter over the top ; set in 
the oven until the crumbs are brown. 

Stewed Lobster. — A middling-sized lobster is best; pick 
all the meat from the shells and mince it fine ; season with 
a little salt, pepper, and grated nutmeg ; add three o\ four 
spoonfuls of rich gravy and a small bit of butter. If you 



58 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

have no gravy, use more butter and two spoonfuls of 
vinegar ; stew about twenty minutes. 

Lobster Salad, see Salads. 
Lobster Croquettes, see Croquettes. 
Lobster Sauce, see Sauces. 

Lobster Patties. — Proceed as in oyster patties, but use the 
meat of a cold boiled lobster. 

Terrapins. — Put the terrapins into a pot of boiling water, 
where they must remain until they are quite dead. You 
then divest them of their outer skin and toe-nails ; and, 
after washing them in warm water, boil them again until 
they become quite tender, adding a handful of salt to the 
water. Having satisfied yourself of their being perfectly 
tender, take off the shells and clean the terrapins very care- 
fully, removing the sandbag and gall without by any means 
breaking them. Then cut the meat into Small pieces and put 
into a saucepan, adding the juice which has been given out 
in cutting them up, but no water, and season with salt, cay- 
enne, and black pepper to your taste, adding a quarter of 
a pound of good butter for each terrapin and a handful of 
flour for thickening. After stirring a short time, add four 
or five tablespoonfuls of cream, and a half pint of good 
Maderia to every four terrapins, and serve hot in a deep 
dish. A very little mace may be added and a large table- 
spoonful of mustard ; just before serving, add the yelks of 
four hard-boiled eggs. During the stewing, particular 
attention must be paid to stirring the preparation frequently ; 
and terrapins cannot possibly be served too hot. 

Mock Terrapin. — Take half a calf's l'Ver, season and fry it 
brown ; chop it into dice, not too small ; flour it thickly, 
and add a teaspoonful of mixed mustard, a little cayenne 
pepper, two hard-boiled eggs chopped fine, a lump of but- 



FISIT, OYSTERS, ETC. 59 

ter the size of an egg, and a teacupful of water. Let it boil 
a minute or two. Cold veal will do as well as liver. 

Scalloped Crabs. — Put the crabs into a kettle of boiling 
water, and throw in a handful of salt. Boil from twenty 
minutes to half an hour. Take them from the water when 
done and pick out all the meat ; be careful not to break the 
shell. To a pint of meat put a little salt and pepper ; taste, 
and if not enough add more, a little at a time, till suited. 
Grate in a very little nutmeg, and add one spoonful of 
cracker or bread crumbs, two eggs well beaten, and two 
tablespoonfuls of butter (even full) ; stir all well together ; 
wash the shells clean, and fill each shell full of the mixture; 
sprinkle crumbs over the top and moisten with butter, then 
bake until nicely browned on top. 

Soft-shell Crabs. — Season with pepper and salt; roll in 
flour, then in egg, then in bread-crumbs, and fry in hot 
lard. Serve hot with rich condiments. 

Stewed Clams. — Chop the clams and season with pepper 
and salt; put in a saucepan butter the size of an egg, and 
when melted add a teaspoonful of flour; add slowly the 
clam liquor and then the clams, and cook three minutes ; 
then add half a pint of cream, and serve. 

Deviled Clams. — Chop fifty clams very fine; take two 
tomatoes, one onion chopped equally fine, a little parsley, 
thyme, and sweet marjoram, a little salt, pepper, and bread- 
crumbs, adding the juice of the clams until the mixture is 
of the consistency of sausage ; put it in the shells with a 
lump of butter on each ; cover with bread-crumbs, and bake 
one-half hour. 

Clam Chowder. — Forty-five clams chopped, one quart of 
sliced potatoes, one-half pint sliced onions. Cut a few slices 
salt pork, fry to a crisp, chop fine. Put in kettle a little fat 



60 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

from the pork, a layer of potatoes, clams, onions, a little pep- 
per and salt ; another layer of chopped pork, potatoes, etc., 
until all are in. Pour over all the juice of the clams. Cook 
three hours, being careful not to burn. Add a teacupful of 
milk just before serving. 

Scallops. — Wipe dry; dip separately into seasoned egg, 
then into cracker dust, and fry in hot lard. 

RECIPES INCIDENTAL TO FISH. 

Bread Stuffing for Fish. — Take about half a pound of stale 
bread and soak in water, and when soft press out the water; 
add a very little chopped suet, pepper, salt, a large table- 
spoonful of onion minced and fried, and, if preferred, a little 
minced parsley ; cook a trifle, and after removing from the 
fire add a beaten egg. 

Bread Stuffing, No. 2. — Bread-crumbs with a little chopped 
parsley and pork, salt, pepper, and butter. Fill up the fish, 
sew it closely, then bake. 

Cleaning a Shad. — Scale and scrape it carefully; split it 
down the back and remove the contents, reserving the roe 
or melt. Wash well and cook as desired. 

Soaking Salt Fish. — Very salt fish should be soaked several 
hours in three or four changes of warm water. Place the 
skin side up, so that salt crystals may fall away from the 
under or meat side. Wipe carefully and clean, then soak 
for an hour in very cold water. 

Fish in Season. — As a rule, fish are in best condition just 
before they spawn, and many are so while they are full of 
roe, as smelts, mackerel, and shad. As soon as spawning is 
over, they become unfit for food, some of them becoming 
positively unwholesome. In season, the flesh is firm and it 
boils white ; when it boils to a bluish hue, the fish are not 
in season, or are stale.

GENERAL REMARKS ON POULTRY AND GAME — HOW TO SELECT, 
PREPARATION FOR BOILING, FOR ROASTING, ETC. THIRTY-ONE 
RECIPES FOR POULTRY AND GAME. 

RECIPES. 

Roast Turkey. — A young turkey, weighing not more than 
eight or nine pounds, is the best. Wash and clean thor- 
oughly, wiping dry, as moisture will spoil the stuffing. 
Take one small loaf of bread grated fine, rub into it a piece 
of butter the size of an egg, one small teaspoonful of pep- 
per and one of salt ; a sprinkling of sweet marjoram, sum- 
mer savory, or sage, if liked. Rub all together, and fill the 
turkey, sewing up so that the stuffing cannot cook out. 
Always put the giblets under the side of the fowl, so they 
will not dry up. Rub salt, pepper, and butter on the out- 
side; put into dripping-pan with one teacupful of water, 
basting often, turning the fowl till brown all over ; bake 
about two hours ; take out the giblets and chop fine. After 
taking out the turkey, put a large tablespoonful of flour into 
the pan and stir until brown. Put the giblets into a gravy- 
boat, and pour over them the gravy. 

Boiled Turkey. — Stuff the turkey as for roasting. A very 
nice dressing is made by chopping half a pint of oysters 
and mixing them with bread-crumbs, butter, pepper, salt, 
thyme, and wet with milk or water. Baste about the turkey 
a thin cloth, the inside of which has been dredged with 
flour, and put it to boil in cold water with a teaspoonful of salt 



62 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

in ft. Let a large turkey simmer for three hours; skim 
while boiling. Serve with oyster sauce, made by adding to 
a cupful of the liquor in which the turkey was boiled the 
same quantity of milk and eight oysters chopped fine ; sea- 
son with minced parsley ; stir in a spoonful of rice or wheat 
flour wet with cold milk ; a tablespoonful of butter. Boil 
up once and pour into a tureen. 

Boned Turkey. — Boil a large turkey in as little water as 
possible until the meat falls from the bones ; remove all the 
bones and skin ; pick the meat into small pieces, and mix 
dark and light together ; season with pepper and salt ; put 
into a mold and pour over it the liquor, which must be kept 
warm, and press with a heavy weight. 

Roast Chicken. — Having selected your chickens in view of 
the foregoing hints, proceed, in the matters of cleansing, 
filling, and preparing for the oven, precisely as directed in 
the case of roast turkey. As the roasting goes on, baste 
and turn as may be needful to secure a rich brown all over 
the fowls. Prepare the gravy as in the former case. 

Stewed Chicken. — Clean and cut the chicken into joints ; 
put it in a saucepan with the giblets ; stew in just enough 
water to cover it until tender ; season with pepper, salt, and 
butter ; thicken with flour ; boil up once and serve with the 
gravy poured over it. 

Broiled Chicken. — Only young, tender chickens are nice 
broiled. After cleaning and washing them, split down the 
back, wipe dry, season with salt and pepper, and lay them 
inside down on a hot gridiron over a bed of bright coals. 
Broil until nicely browned and well cooked through, watch- 
ing and turning to prevent burning. If chickens are large, 
steaming them for one-half hour before placing on the grid- 
iron will better insure their being cooked through. 



POULTRY AND GAME. 63 

Chicken Souffle. — Take the white meat of one chicken, 
remove all skin and sinews, chop very fine. Put the 
chopped meat in a skillet or stew-pan, add some white 
sauce, a little chopped parsley ; salt and pepper to taste ; 
stir it until it boils ; allow it to cool a little ; add yolks of 
three eggs beaten to a froth, and stir well. Turn into a 
baking-dish or mould which has been well buttered and 
the bottom covered with fine cracker crumbs. Bake in 
a very quick oven. Serve with white sauce. 

Chicken Patties. — Prepare crusts in the same way as 
for tarts. Boil the chicken until tender. Chop the 
meat, but not too fine. Make a gravy out of the water 
in which the chicken was boiled by adding a half-cupful 
of flour and two teaspoonfuls of butter to a quart of 
water. Season with pepper and salt to taste ; put the 
chopped chicken into the gravy, and boil for five min- 
utes, and fill the crusts with it. Don't have the filling 
too thin. Serve at once. 

Potted Pigeon. — Clean the birds and then stuff them 
with a dressing proportioned in following recipe. Sew 
them up and truss them ; boil them for half an hour with 
just water enough to cover them ; take them out and 
drain ; roll in flour and fry brown in pork fat ; make a 
gravy out of the liquid in which they were boiled, thick- 
ened with flour and seasoned to taste ; let the pigeons 
simmer in this gravy for two hours ; serve with the gravy. 

Poultry Dressing. — Toast eight slices of white bread; 
place in a deep dish, add butter the size of an egg, cover 
with hot water to melt butter and make bread of right 
consistency ; add one even teaspoonful of Bell's Spiced 
Seasoning and one even teaspoonful of salt; mix well 
and stir in one or two raw eggs. 



g4 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Fricasseed Chickens. — Cut them in pieces, and put in the 
stewpan with salt and pepper ; add a little water, and let 
them boil half an hour ; thon thicken the gravy with flour ; 
add butter and a little cream, if you have it. Catsup is an 
additional relish to the gravy. 

Smothered Chicken. — Dress your chickens ; wash and let 
them stand in water half an hour to make them white ; cut 
them open at the back; put into a baking-pan, sprinkle 
salt and pepper over them, putting a lump of butter here 
and there ; cover tightly with another pan the same size, and 
bake one hour ; baste often with butter. 

Pried Chicken. — Prepare the chicken as for stewing ; dry it, 
season with salt and pepper, dredge with flour, and fry 
brown in hot butter or lard ; take it out, drain, and serve 
with Challenge Sauce, or some other savory condiment, or 
pour into the gravy left in the frying-pan a cup of milk, 
thicken with flour, add a little butter, and season with Sal- 
picant; boil once and pour over the chicken, or serve sepa- 
rately. 

Chickens. Pried with Rice. — Take two or three chickens, 
cut them up, and half fry them ; then boil half a pint of rice 
in a quart of water, leaving the grains distinct, but not too 
dry ; stir one large tablespoonful of butter in the rice while 
hot ; let five eggs be well beaten into the rice, with a little 
salt, pepper, and nutmeg, if the last is liked ; put the chick- 
ens into a deep dish, and cover with the rice ; brown in an 
oven not too hot. 

Chicken Pie. — Line the sides of a deep pie-dish with a 
good puff paste. Have your chicken cooked, as for a 
fricassee, seasoned with salt and pepper and a little, chopped 
parsley. When they are nearly cooked, lay them in a pie- 
dish with half a pound of salt pork cut into small squares, 
and some of the paste also cut into half-inch pieces ; pour 



POULTRY AND CAME. 65 

in a part of the chicken gravy, thicken with a little flour, 
and cover the dish with the paste cover. Cut a hole the 
size of a dollar in the cover, and cover it with a piece of 
dough. When baking, remove this piece occasionally and 
examine the interior. Brush egg over the top crust of the 
pie, and bake in a quick oven. Should the pie become dry 
pour in more of the gravy. Pigeon pie or any other bird 
pie may be made by the above recipe. 

Chicken Pot-pie. — Cut and joint a large chicken. Cover 
with water, arid let it boil gently until tender. Season with 
salt and pepper, and thicken the gravy with two tablespoon- 
fuls of flour mixed smooth in a piece of butter the size of 
an egg. Have ready nice, light bread dough ; cut with a 
biscuit-cutter about an inch thick ; drop this into the boiling 
gravy, having previously removed the chicken to a hot 
platter; cover, and let them boil from one-half to three- 
quarters of an hour. To ascertain whether they are done, 
stick them with a fork ; if it comes out clean, they are done. 
Lay them on the platter with the chicken, pour over the 
gravy, and serve. 

Pressed Chicken. — Boil three chickens until the meat 
comes off the bones ; then, removing all bones and skin, 
chop the meat, but do not chop very fine ; add a piece 
of butter as large as an egg ; salt and pepper to season 
well. Take about a pint of the broth in which the 
chickens were boiled, into which put one-half a box 
of Swampscott Sparkling Gelatine ; when the gelatine 
has dissolved, put back the chopped chicken and cook 
until the broth is evenly absorbed. Pour the whole into 
a mould or pan and press under a weight until cold. 
When ready, serve with sliced hard-boiled eggs and 
garnish with parsley, water-cress or sliced lemon. Veal 
may be treated in a similar manner. 



66 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Jellied Chicken. — Cook a chicken in boiling water until 
tender, remove skin and bones, and season to taste, and 
place in mould. Place the bones back in the liquid and 
boil until there is about one quart of liquid left. Add 
one-quarter box Swampscott Sparkling Gelatine and 
the juice of one lemon ; salt and pepper to taste ; strain 
over the chicken and stand in cool place to harden. 

Roast Goose and Duck. — A goose should always be par- 
boiled, as it removes the rank taste and makes it more 
palatable. Clean, prepare, and roast the same as turkey, 
only adding to the force-meat a large onion chopped fine. 
Ducks dp not require parboiling (unless very old), otherwise 
. they are cooked the same as geese. 

Canvas-back Duck. — Having picked, singed, and drawn it 
well, wipe it carefully, so as to have it clean without wash- 
ing. Truss it, leaving the head on, to show its quality. 
Place it in a moderately hot oven for at least three-quarters 
of an hour ; serve it hot, in its own gravy, on a large chafing- 
dish. Currant jelly should be on the table. 

Roast Pigeons. — Clean, wash, and stuff the same as poultry ; 
lay them in rows in a dripping-pan with a little water. 
Unless they are very fat, baste with butter until they are 
half done, afterward with their own gravy. 

Roast Snipe. — Clean and truss, but do not stuff! Lay in 
rows in the dripping-pan, sprinkle with salt, and baste well 
with butter, then with butter and water. When they begin 
to brown, cut as many slices of bread as there are birds. 
Toast quickly, butter, and lay in the dripping-pan, a bird 
upon each. When the birds are done, serve upon the toast, 
with the gravy poured over it. The toast should lie under 
them while cooking at least five minutes, during which time 
the birds should be basted with melted butter seasoned with 
pepper. The largest snipe will not require above twenty 



POULTRY AND GAME. 67 

minutes to roast. Or, dip an oyster in melted butter, then 
in bread-crumbs, seasoned with pepper and salt, and put in 
each bird before roasting. Small birds are especially de- 
licious cooked in this way. 

Roast Partridges, Pheasants, or Quails. — Pluck, singe, draw, 
and truss them ; season with salt and pepper; roast for about 
half an hour in a brisk oven, basting often with butter. 
When done, place on a dish together with bread-crumbs 
fried brown and arranged in small heaps. Gravy should be 
served separately in a tureen. 

Quail on Toast. — Clean, wash, slit down the back, sprinkle 
with salt and pepper, and lay them on a gridiron, the inside 
down. Broil slowly; when nicely browned, butter well. 
Serve with cream gravy on toast. Omitting the cream, 
gravy, and toast, you have the ordinary broiled quail. 
Pigeons, woodcock, and small birds may be broiled in the 
same manner, and are delicious and nourishing for invalids. 

Pried Rabbit. — After the rabbit has been thoroughly 
cleaned and washed, put it into boiling water and let it boil 
for about ten minutes ; drain, and when cold, cut it into 
joints ; dip into beaten egg, and then into fine bread-crumbs, 
seasoned with salt and pepper. When all are ready, fry 
them in butter over a moderate fire fifteen minutes ; thicken 
the gravy with an ounce of butter and a small teaspocnful 
of flour. Serve hot. 

Roast Rabbit. — Dress nicely and fill with a dressing made 
of bread-crumbs, a little onion, sage, pepper, and salt, and a 
small piece of butter ; tie a piece of salt pork over it ; put 
into a dripping-pan with a little water in a quick oven ; 
baste often ; serve with currant jelly. 

Broiled Steaks of Venison. — Heat the gridiron, grease it 
well, lay on the steaks ; broil quickly, without scorching, 



68 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

turning them two or three times ; season with salt and 
pepper. Have butter melted in a well-heated platter, into 
which lay steaks, hot from the gridiron, turning them over 
several times in the butter, and serve hot with currant jelly 
on each steak. It is well to set the platter into another 
containing boiling water. 

Game or Poultry in Jelly. — Take a knuckle of veal weighing 
two pounds ; a slice of lean ham ; one shallot, minced ; a 
sprig of thyme and one of parsley ; six pepper-corns (white) 
and one teaspoonful of salt, with three pints of cold water. 
Boil all these together until the liquor is reduced to a pint ; 
strain without squeezing, and set to cool until next day. It 
should then be a firm jelly. Take off every particle of fat. 
Then take one package gelatine, soaked in one cupful cold 
water for three hours ; one tablespoonful of sugar ; two table- 
spoonfuls strained lemon juice, and two tablespoonfuls of 
currant jelly, dissolved in cold water, and strained through 
a muslin cloth. Pour a quart of boiling water over the gela- 
tine, stir for a moment, add the jellied " stock," and when 
this is dissolved, add sugar, lemon juice, and coloring. Stir 
until all are mixed and melted together, and strain without 
shaking or squeezing through a flannel bag until quite clear. 
Have ready several hard-boiled eggs, and the remains of 
roast game, roast or boiled poultry, cut in neat, thin slices, 
and salted slightly. Wet a mold with cold water, and 
when the jelly begins to harden, pour some in the bottom. 
Cut the whites of the eggs in pretty shapes — stars, flowers, 
rings, leaves — with a keen penknife, and arrange these on 
the lowest stratum of jelly, which should be thin, that the 
forms may be visible. Add more jelly, and on this lay 
slices of meat, close together. More jelly, and proceed in 
this order until the mold is full. Set in a cool place to 
harden, and then turn out upon a flat dish. A mold with 
smooth, upright sides, is best for this purpose. 



POULTRY AND GAME. Q& 

RECIPES INCIDENTAL TO POULTRY, GAME, ETC. 

Gravy for Poultry. — Boil the giblets very tender; chop fine ; 
then take the liquor in which they are boiled, thicken with 
flour ; season with salt, pepper, and a little butter ; add the 
giblets and dripping in which the turkey was roasted. 

Plain Stuffing. — Take stale bread, cut off all the crust, rub 
very fine, and pour over it as much melted butter as will 
make it crumble in your hands ; salt and pepper to taste. 
See also under " Roast Turkey." 

Potato Stuffing. — Take two-thirds bread and one-third 
boiled potatoes grated, butter size of an egg, pepper, salt, 
one egg ; mix thoroughly. 

Oyster Stuffing. — By substituting oysters for potatoes in 
the above, you have.oyster filling. See also under " Boiled 
Turkey." 

Stuffing for Boiled Chicken. — One cupful of bread-crumbs, 
one tablespoonful of butter, one egg, half a teaspoonful of 
salt, and one tablespoonful of sweet marjoram. Mix well ; 
stuff and sew in. 

Capons. — Young male fowls, prepared by early gelding, 
and "then nicely fattened, are the finest delicacies in the 
poultry line. They may be known by a small head, pale 
comb, which is short and withered, the neck feathers longer 
than usual, smooth legs, and soft, short spurs. They are 
cooked as ordinary chickens. 

Keeping Game. — Game is rendered more tender, and its 
flavor is improved by keeping. If wrapped in a cloth satu- 
rated with equal parts of pyroligneous acid and water, it 
will keep many days. If in danger of tainting, clean, rub 
well with salt, and plunge into boiling water, letting it run 
through them for five minutes ; then hang in a cold place. 
If tainted, put them in new milk over night. Always hanf 
them up by the neck. 



70 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Duckling Pot Roast. — This is a very good way to cook 
this very acceptable bird. Put into a shallow crock a 
thin strip of bacon and a tablespoonful of mixed whole 
spice. Clean and truss two ducklings, put them in the 
crock, add hot water or soup-stock enough to come up 
half-way on the birds. Then add a sprig of celery and 
two of parsley ; place a narrow strip of bacon over each 
bird; cover close and set the crock in a moderate oven, 
where the birds will cook slowly two hours. Remove 
the ducklings, strain the sauce, and reduce it one-third 
by boiling ; add a gill of dark wine ; thicken with a 
dash of brown flour ; simmer fifteen minutes ; add a 
teaspoonful of lemon-juice and serve with the duck. A 
small quantity of the sauce may be boiled down until 
thick as cream. This is called glaze ; it is brushed 
over the bird before serving. — Thomas J. Murrey. 

Fillet of Grouse. — Remove the breast and separate into 
four or six pieces. Disjoint and cook the remainder in 
boiling salted water to cover, till tender ; then remove 
all the meat and chop it fine. Thicken the broth (which 
should be reduced to half a cup), season, and moisten 
the meat. Spread the minced meat on squares of toast ; 
put a layer of currant jelly on each. Rub the fillets 
with butter and broil them carefully ; season with salt, 
pepper and butter, and lay them on the jelly. — The 
Peerless Cook Book : Mrs. D. A. Lincoln, Roberts 
Brothers, Publishers. 

Potted Fowl Roast. — Put fowl in pot, half covering 
with boiling water, and boil until tender, letting the 
water boil away. Add salt and pepper and let fowl 
brown in the fat. Serve with a gravy.

HOW TO ROAST, BROIL, AND BOIL BEEF. NINETEEN RECIPES 
FOR COOKING BEEF. 

RECIPES. 

Roast Beef — The best roasting-pieces are the middle ribs 
and the sirloin. The ends of the ribs should be removed 
from the flank, and the latter folded under the beef and 
securely fastened with skewers. Rub a little salt into the 
fat part ; place the meat in the dripping-pan with a pint of 
stock or water ; baste freely, and dredge with flour half an 
hour before taking the joint from the oven. Should the 
oven be very hot, place a buttered paper over the meat to 
prevent it scorching while yet raw. When the paper is 
used it will need very little basting. Or, turn the rib side 
up toward the fire for the first twenty minutes. The time it 
will take in cooking depends upon the thickness of the joint 
and the length of time the animal has been killed. Skim the 
fat from the gravy and add a tablespoonful of prepared 
brown flour to the remainder. 

Roast Beef with Yorkshire Pudding. — Take a large rib 
roast ; rub salt and pepper over it, and dredge with flour. 
Place on a rack in a dripping-pan, with very little water, 
until it is heated thoroughly; baste frequently. When 
nicely browned on the upper side, turn and baste. About 
three-quarters of an hour before it is done, take out the 
meat, pour off most of the dripping, put the batter for the 



72 THE HO USE WIFE'S LIBRAR Y. 

pudding in the bottom of the pan, allowing the drippingu 
from the beef to drop into it. When the pudding is done, 
return the meat and finish roasting. Add some hot water 
t© the dripping and thicken with flour for the gravy. 

For the batter of this pudding, take half a cup of butter, 
three cups of flour, three eggs, one cup of milk, and two 
teaspoonfuls of baking powder. 

Beef a la Mode. — Take a round of fresh beef, extract the 
•bone, and take away the fat. For a round weighing ten 
pounds, make a seasoning or stuffing as follows : Half a 
pound of beef suet ; half a pound of grated bread-crumbs ; 
the crumbled yelks of three hard-boiled eggs; a little 
bundle of sweet marjoram, the leaves chopped; another of 
sweet basil ; four onions minced small; a large tablespoonful 
of mixed mace and nutmeg powdered. Season lightly with 
salt and cayenne. Stuff this mixture into the place from 
whence you took out the bone. Make a number of deep 
cuts about the meat, and stuff them also. Skewer the meat 
into a favorable shape, and secure its form by tying it round 
with tape. Put it -into a tin bakepan, and pour over it a 
pint of port wine. Put on the lid, and bake the beef slowly for 
five or six hours, or till it is thoroughly done. If the meat 
is to be eaten hot, skim all the fat from the gravy, into 
which, after it is taken off the fire, stir in the beaten yelks 
of two eggs. Minced oysters maybe substituted for onions. 

Spiced Beet — Boil a shin of beef weighing ten or twelve 
pounds, until the meat falls readily from the bones. Pick 
the meat to pieces, and mash the gristle very fine, rejecting' 
all parts that are too hard to mash. Set away the liquor in 
which the beef has boiled till it is cold ; then take off all the 
fat. Boil the liquor down to a pint and a half. Roll a 
dozen crackers very fine, and add them to the meat. Then 
return the meat to the liquor, and heat it all. Add salt and 
pepper to taste, half a teasooonful of cloves, half a teaspoon* 



MEATS. 73 

ful of cinnamon, half a teaspoonful 01 parsley chopped fine, 
and a little powdered nutmeg. Let it boil up once, and put 
into a mold or deep dish, with a weight adjusted to press 
it down. When it is entirely cold, cut into thin slices. 

Savory Beef — Take a shin of beef from the hind-quarter, 
saw it into four pieces, put it into a pot, and boil it until the 
meat and gristle drop from the bones ; chop the meat very 
fine, put it in a dish, and season it with a little salt, pepper, 
clove, and sage, to your taste ; pour in the liquor in which 
the meat was boiled, and place it away to harden. Cut in 
slices and eat cold. 

Minced Beet — Cut cold roast beef into thin slices; put 
some of the gravy into a stewpan, a bit ■ of butter rolled in 
flour, pepper and salt, and boil it up Add a little catsup, 
and put in the minced slices, and heat them through, but do 
not let it boil. Put small slices of toast in the dish, and 
cover with the meat. 

Deviled Beef — Take slices of cold roast beef, lay them on 
hot coals, and broil ; season with pepper and salt, and serve 
while hot, with a small lump of butter on each piece. 

Curried Beef — Take about two ounces of butter and place 
them in a saucepan with two small onions cut up into slices, 
and let them fry till they are of a light brown ; then add a 
tablespoonful and a half of curry powder, and mix it up 
well. Now cut up the beef into pieces about an inch 
square ; pour in from a quarter to a third of a pint of milk, 
and let it simmer for thirty minutes ; then take it off and 
place it in a dish with a little lemon juice. While cooking 
stir constantly, to prevent burning. Send it to table with a 
wall of mashed potatoes or rice around it. 

Beef Hash. — Chop fine cold steak or roast beef, and cook 
in a little water ; add cream or milk, and thicken with flour ; 
season to taste, and pour over thin slices of toast. 



74 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Beef Stew. — Cut cold beef into small pieces, and put into 
cold water ; add one tomato, a little onion, chopped fine ; 
pepper and salt, and cook slowly ; thicken with butter and 
flour, and pour over toast. 

Boiled Corned Beef. — Put four or five pounds of lean corned 
meat into a pot with plenty of water. The water should be 
hot. The same care should be taken in skimming as for 
fresh meat. Allow half an hour for every pound of meat 
after it has begun to boil. The excellence of corned beef 
depends very much upon its being boiled gently and long. 
If it is to be eaten cold, lay it, when boiled, into a coarse 
earthen dish or pan, and over it a clean board about the 
size of the meat ; upon this put a heavy weight. Salt meat 
is much improved by pressing. 

Stewed Shin of Beef. — Wash, and set it on to stew in suffi- 
cient cold water to keep it just covered until done. When 
it boils, take off the scum, and put an ounce and a quarter 
of salt to the gallon of water. It is usual to add a few cloves 
and some black pepper, slightly bruised and tied up loosely 
in a fold of muslin, two or more onions, a root of celery, a 
bunch of savory herbs, four or five carrots, and as many 
turnips, either whole or sliced ; if to be served with the 
meat, the last two will require a little more than the ordinary 
time of boiling, but otherwise they may be simmered with 
the meat from the beginning. Give the beef from four to 
five hours' gentle stewing, and serve it with part of its own 
liquor thickened and flavored, or quite plain. 

Boiled Tongue. — Soak the tongue over night, then boil four 
or five hours. Peel off the outer skin and return it to the 
water in which it was boiled to cool. This will render it 
juicy and tender. 

Baked Heart. — Wash carefully and stuff nicely ; roast or 
bake and serve with gravy, which should be thickened with 



MEATS. 75 

some of the stuffing. It is very nice hashed, with a little 
port wine added. 

Broiled Beefeteak. — Have the choice steaks cut three- 
quarters of an inch thick ; grease the gridiron and have it 
well heated. Put the steak over a hot, clear fire. When the 
steak is colored, turn it over, which must be done without 
sticking a fork into it and thus letting out the juice. It 
should be quite rare or pink in the centre, but not raw. 
When cooked sufficiently, lay on a hot platter and season 
with pepper and salt ; spread over the top some small bits of 
butter, and serve immediately. Salt extracts the juices of 
meats in cooking. Steaks ought not to be salted until they 
have been broiled. 

Beefeteak with Onions: — Take a nice rumpsteak, and pound 
it with a rolling-pin until it is quite tender ; flour and season; 
put it into a frying-pan with hot lard and fry it. When 
well browned on both sides, take it up and dredge with flour. 
Have about two dozen onions ready boiled ; strain them in 
a colander and put them in a frying-pan, seasoning with 
pepper and salt ; dredge in a little flour, and add a smaii 
lump of butter ; place the pan over the fire and stir the 
onions frequently, to prevent tl~ Jr scorching. When they 
are soft and a little brown, return the steak to the pan, and 
heat all together. Place the steak on a large dish, pour the 
onions and gravy over it, and send to the table hot. 

Beefeteak and Tomatoes. — Stew a dozen good-sized tomatoes 
one hour, with salt and pepper. Then put in a pound of 
tender beefsteak, cut in small pieces, and boil fifteen min- 
utes longer. Lay buttered toast in a deep dish, pour on the 
steak and tomato, and you have a most relishing and 
healthful dish. 

Stuffed Beefsteak. — Take a rump steak about an inch thick. 
Make a stuffing of bread and herbs, and spread it over the 
steak. Roll it up, and with a needle and coarse thread sew 



76 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

it together. Lay it in an iron pot on one or two wooden 
skewers, and put in water just sufficient to cover it. Let it 
stew slowly for two hours — longer if the beef is tough ; 
serve it in a dish with the gravy turned over it. To be 
carved crosswise, in slices, through beef and stuffing. 

BeeMeak Pudding. — Prepare a good suet crust, and line a 
cake tin with it; put in layers of steak, with onions, toma- 
toes and mushrooms chopped, a seasoning of pepper, salt, 
and cayenne, and half a teacupful of water before closing it. 
Bake from an hour and a half to two hours, and serve hot 



II.— VEAL. 

CHOOSING VEAL, FOR ROASTING, FOR STEWING; THE HEAD, 
FEET, KIDNEYS, SWEET-BREADS, ETC.; GENERAL USEFULNESS. 
TWENTY-ONE RECIPES FOR COOKING VEAL. 

VEAL should be fat, finely grained, white, firm, and not 
overgrown. When large, it is apt to be coarse and tough, 
and if too young, it lacks flavor and is less wholesome. 
it is more difficult to keep than any meat except pork, and 
should never be allowed to acquire the slightest taint before 
it is dressed. 

The fillet, the loin, the shoulder, and the best end of the 
neck, are the parts preferred for roasting ; the breast and 
knuckle are more usually stewed or boiled. The head and 
feet of the calf are valuable articles of food, both for the 
nutriment which the gelatinous parts of them afford, and for 
the greater variety of modes in which they may be dressed. 
The kidneys, with the rich fat that surrounds them, and the 
sweet-breads especially, are well-known delicacies; the 
liver and the heart also are very good eating ; and no meat 
s so generally useful for rich soups and gravies as veal. 



MEATS. 77 

The best veal is from calves not less than four, or more 
than six weeks old. If younger it is not wholesome. If 
older its character begins to change materially from the 
calf's use of grasses and other food. 

RECIPES. 

Roast Veal — Take a loin or fillet of veal ; make a stuffing 
as for roast turkey ; fill the flat with the stuffing, and sew it 
firmly to the loin ; rub the veal with salt, pepper, and flour, 
and put it into a pan with a little water. While roasting, 
baste frequently, letting it cook until thoroughly done. 
Allow two hours for a roast weighing from six to eight 
pounds. When done, remove the threads before sending 
to the table ; thicken the gravy with a little flour. Veal 
should be rather overdone. 

Pot-roasted Fillet. — Remove the bone and fill the cavity 
with a force-meat made of bread-crumbs, a very little salt, 
pork chopped fine, sage, pepper, salt, and ground cloves. 
Lay in the pot a layer of slices of salt pork ; put in the fil 
let, fastened with skewers, cover with additional pork, pout 
over it a pint of good stock, cover down close, and let it 
cook slowly two or three hours ; then take off the cover 
and let it brown. Serve hot. 

Boiled Fillet — A small and delicately white fillet should 
be selected for this purpose. Bind it round with tape, after 
having washed it thoroughly ; cover it well with cold water, 
and bring it gently to a boil ; clear off carefully the scum 
as it rises, and be very cautious not to allow the water to 
become smoked. Let the meat be gently simmered for three 
hours and a half to four and a half, according to its weight. 
Send it to table with rich white sauce. 

Veal Stew. — Cut four or five pounds of veal into strips ; 
peel a dozen large potatoes, and cut them into slices ; place 
a layer of sliced salt pork with salt, pepper, sage, and onion 



78 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

on the bottom of the pot, then a layer of potatoes, then a 
layer of the veal nicely seasoned. Use up the veal thus. 
Over the last layer of veal put a layer of the pork, and 
over the whole a layer of potatoes. Pour in water till it 
covers the whole ; cover the pot closely ; heat it rapidly for 
a few minutes, and then let it simmer two hours. 

Veal Hash. — Take a teacupful of boiling water in a sauce- 
pan, stir into it an even teaspoonful of flour wet in a table- 
spoonful of cold water, and let it boil five minutes ; add 
one-half teaspoonful of black pepper, as much salt, and two 
tablespoonfuls of butter, and let it keep hot, but not boil. 
Chop the veal fine and mix with half as much stale bread- 
crumbs. Put into a pan and pour the gravy over it, then 
let it simmer ten minutes. Serve this on buttered toast. 

Veal Pie. — Line a pudding-dish with good pie crust ; into 
this put a layer of veal cut into small slices from the neck, 
or other less valuable part ; make a second layer of hard- 
boiled eggs sliced thin ; butter and pepper this layer. Add 
a layer of sliced ham, or salt pork, squeezing a few drops 
of lemon juice on the ham. Add more veal, as before, with 
eggs, ham, etc., till the dish is nearly full. Pour over a 
cupful of stock and cover with a stout crust. Bake in a 
moderate oven for two hours. 

Veal Pot Pie. — Make a crust of a dozen mashed potatoes, 
two tablespoonfuls of butter, half a teacup of milk or cream, 
a little salt, and flour enough to stiffen it nicely. Fry half 
a dozen slices of salt pork, then cut up the veal and boil 
these together, in but little water, till the veal is almost 
done. Peel and slice a dozen potatoes quite thin, and roll 
the dough about half an inch thick and cut it into strips. 
Now build in your pot a layer of crust, meat, potatoes ; then 
sprinkle with salt and pepper. Then another set of layers, 
and top off with crust. Pour on the liquor in which the 
meat was cooked, and let all simmer for half an hour, or until 



MEATS. 7 J 

the top crust is cooked. Brown the crust by holding over 
it a red-hot shovel. 

Veal Loaf — Take a piece of butter the size of an egg, three 
pounds of raw veal, one heaping teaspoonful of salt, one of 
pepper, and two raw eggs. Chop the veal fine and mix all 
together, and put in about two tablespoonfuls of water. 
Mold this into a loaf, then roll it in eight tablespoonfuls of 
rolled crackers, and pour over it three tablespoonfuls of 
melted butter ; place in a pan and bake two hours. To be 
sliced off when cold, and served at luncheon or tea. 

Veal with Oysters. — Cut the veal in small, thin slices, place 
it in layers in a jar with salt, pepper, and oysters. Pour in 
the liquor of the oysters, set the jar in a kettle of boiling 
water, and let it stew till the meat becomes very tender. 

Veal with Rice. — Pour over a small knuckle of veal rather 
more than sufficient water to cover it ; bring it slowly to a 
boil ; take off all the scum with great care ; throw in a tea- 
spoonful of salt, and when the joint has simmered for about 
half an hour, throw in from eight to twelve ounces of well- 
washed rice, and stew the veal gently for an hour and a halt 
longer, or until both the meat and rice are perfectly tender. 
A seasoning of cayenne and mace in fine powder, with more 
salt, should it be required, must be added twenty or thirty 
minutes before they are served. For a superior stew, good 
veal broth may be substituted for the water. 

Veal with Peas. — A quart or more of full-grown green 
peas, instead of rice, added to the veal, prepared as above, 
as soon as the scum has been cleared off, will make a most 
excellent stew. It should be well seasoned with white 
pepper, and the mace should be omitted. 

Cutlets ill Craoker. — Pound the cutlet and season, cut the 
edges into good shape ; take one egg, beat it a little, roll 
the cutlet in it, then cover thoroughly with rolled crackers.

Have a lump of butter and lard mixed hot in your skillet } 
put in the meat and cook slowly. When nicely browned 
stir in one spoonful of flour for the gravy ; add half a pint 
of sweet milk, and let it come to a boil. Salt and pepper. 

Cutlets, Broiled. — Trim evenly ; sprinkle salt and pepper on 
both sides ; dip in melted butter, and place upon the grid- 
iron over a clear fire; baste while broiling with melted 
butter, turn over three or four times ; serve with melted 
butter, or tomato sauce. 

Pressed Veal. — Put four pounds of veal in a pot ; cover 
with water ; stew slowly until the meat drops from the bone, 
then take out and chop fine ; let the liquor boil down until 
there is a cupful ; put in a small cupful of butter, a table- 
spoonful of pepper, a little allspice, and a beaten egg ; stir 
this through the meat ; slice a hard-boiled egg ; lay in a 
mold, and press in the meat ; when put upon the table gar- 
nish with celery tops or parsley. 

Minced Veal. — Heat a cupful of well-thickened gravy to a 
boil; add two tablespoonfuls of cream or rich milk, one 
tablespoonful of butter, pepper and salt, parsley to taste, a 
small onion, and three eggs well beaten; When these are 
stirred in, add the cold minced meat, salted and peppered. 
Let it heat thoroughly, but not boil. 

Veal Scallops. — Mince the meat very small, and set it over 
the fire ; season with grated nutmeg, pepper and salt, and a 
little cream. Then put it into scallop-shells, and cover with 
crumbs of bread, over which put bits of butter, and brown 
at a quick fire. Serve hot, with catsup or mushroom sauce. 

Calf's Liver or Heart. — Cut the liver in slices, plunge into 
boiling water for an instant, wipe dry, season with pepper and 
salt, dredge with flour, and fry brown in lard. Have it per- 
fectly done. Serve in gravy, made with either milk or water. 
Calf's heart dressed in this way is also very palatable.

Broiled Sweet-breads.— Parboil and blanch the sweet« 
breads by putting them first into hot water and keeping it 
at a hard boil for five minutes, then plunging it into ice- 
cold water somewhat salted. Allow them to lie in this ten 
minutes, wipe them very dry, and with a sharp knife split in 
half, lengthwise. Broil over a clear, hot fire, turning when- 
ever they begin to drip. Have ready upon a deep plate 
melted butter, well salted and peppered, mixed with catsup 
or Challenge sauce. When the sweet-breads are done to a 
fine brown lay them in this preparation, turning them over 
several times ; cover and set them in a warm oven. Serve 
on fried bread or toast in a chafing-dish, a piece of sweet- 
bread on each. Pour on the hot butter and send to table. 

Stewed Sweet-breads. — Parboil, blanch, and cut into small 
pieces ; boil fifteen minutes in milk ; stir into this chopped 
parsley, a little butter, and cornstarch to thicken. Serve hot. 

Broiled Kidneys. — Skin the kidneys carefully, but do not 
slice or split them. Lay for ten minutes in warm (not hot) 
melted butter, rolling them over and over, that every part may 
be well basted. Broil on a gridiron over a clear fire, turn 
ing them every minute. Unless very large, they should be 
done in about twelve minutes. Sprinkle with salt and 
pepper, and lay on a hot dish, with butter upon each. 

Calf's Tongue. — Of all the tongue preparations, calf's 
tongue is regarded as best. To pickle them, use for each 
a quarter pound of salt, one ounce of saltpetre, and a quar. 
ter pound of sugar. Rub the tongues daily with this, allow- 
ing them to lie in pickle for two weeks, after which they 
will be ready for smoking or boiling. If used without 
smoking, they require no soaking, but should simmer sev 
eral hours till perfectly done, when the skin will peel oft 
readily. If soaking is needed, lay them first in cold water 
and then in tepid water for two hours each; then boil til* 
done.

III.— MUTTON AND LAMB. 

CHOOSING MUTTON AND LAMB, FOR ROASTING, FOR BOILING} 
CUTLETS, SUITABLE VEGETABLES, ETC. THIRTEEN RECIPES FOR 
MUTTON AND LAMB. 

THE best mutton is small-boned, plump, finely grained, 
and short legged ; the lean of a dark, rather than of a 
bright hue, and the fat white and clear ; when this is 
yellow, the meat is rank, and of bad quality. The leg and 
the loin are the desirable joints ; and the preference would 
probably be given to the latter, but for the superabundance 
of its fat, which renders it a somewhat wasteful part. 

The parts for roasting are the shoulder, saddle, or chine, 
the loin, and haunch. The leg is best boiled, unless the 
mutton is young and very tender. The neck is sometimes 
roasted, but it is more generally boiled ; the scrag, or that 
part of it which joins the head, is seldom used for any other 
purpose than making broth, and should be taken off before 
the joint is dressed. Cutlets from the thick end of the loin 
are commonly preferred, but they are frequently taken from 
the best end of the neck and from the middle of the leg. 

Lamb should be eaten very fresh. In the fore-quarter, the 
vein in the neck should be blue, otherwise it is stale. In the 
hind-quarter the fat of the kidney will have a slight odor if 
not quite fresh. Lamb soon loses its firmness if stale. 

New potatoes, asparagus, green peas, and spinach, are the 
vegetables to be eaten with roast lamb. 

RECIPES. 

Roast Mutton. — Wash the meat well, sprinkle with pepper 
and salt, dredge with flour, and put in the dripping-pan, 
with a little water in the bottom. Baste often with the drip- 
pings, skim the gravy well, and thicken with flour. 



MkAfk. $3 

Soiled Leg of Mutton. — Cut off the shank-bone, trim the 
knuckle, and wash the mutton ; put it into a pot with salt, 
and cover with boiling water. Allow it to boil a few min- 
utes ; skim the surface clean, draw your pot to the side of the 
fire, and simmer until done. Time, from two to two hours 
and a half. Do not try the leg with a fork to determine 
whether it is done. You lose the juices of the meat by so 
doing. Serve with caper sauce, or drawn butter, well sea- 
soned. The liquor from this boiling may be converted into 
soup with the addition of a ham-bone and a few vegetables 
boiled together. 

Mutton Dressed like Venison. — Skin and bone a loin of 
mutton, and lay it into a stewpan with a pint of water, a 
large onion stuck with a dozen cloves, half a pint of port 
wine, and a spoonful of vinegar ; add, when it boils, a little 
thyme and parsley, and some pepper and salt ; let it stew 
three hours, and turn it often. Make some gravy of the 
bones, and add it at intervals to the mutton. 

Broiled Mutton Chops. — Trim off a portion of the fat, or the 
whole of it, unless it be liked ; heat the gridiron, rub it with 
a bit of the mutton suet, broil over a brisk fire, and turn 
often until they are done, which, for the generality of eaters, 
will be in about eight minutes, if the chops are not more 
than half an inch thick, which they should not be. Add 
salt and pepper with melted butter, and serve on a hot 
plate. 

Mutton and Green Peas. — Select a breast of mutton not too 
fat, cut it into small, square pieces, dredge it with flour, and fry 
to a fine brown in butter ; add pepper and salt, cover it with 
water, and set it over a slow fire to stew, until the meat is 
perfectly tender. Take out the meat, skim off all the fat from 
the gravy, and just before serving add a quart of young 
peas, previously boiled with the strained gravy, and let the 
whole boil gently until the peas are entirely done.

Irish Stew. — Blanch three pounds of mutton chops by dip. 
ping them first in boiling water, for two or three minutes, 
and then into ice-cold water. Place them on the bottom of 
a clean stewpan, barely covering them with cold water. 
Bring them slowly to a boil ; add one teaspoonful of salt ; 
skim clean ; add a little parsley, mace, and a few pepper- 
corns. Simmer twenty minutes ; add a dozen small onions 
whole, and two tablespoonfuls of flour mixed well with cold 
water. Let it simmer for an hour ; add a dozen potatoes 
pared and cut to about the size of the onions. Boil till 
these are done ; then dish, placing the chops around the 
edge of the plate, and pouring the onions and potatoes into 
the centre. Strain the gravy, add three tablespoonfuls of 
chopped parsley, and pour over the stew. 

Boiled Leg of Lamb. — Choose a ewe leg, as there is more 
fat on it ; saw off the knuckle, trim off the flap, and the thick 
skin on the back of it ; soak in warm water for three hours, 
then boil gently (time according to size). Serve with oyster 
sauce. (See Sauces.) 

Roast Lamb. — Wash well, season with pepper ana salt, put 
in the dripping-pan with a little water. Baste often with 
the dripping ; skim the gravy well and thicken with flour. 

Lamb Stewed in Butter. — Select a nice loin, wash well, and 
wipe very dry ; skewer down the flap, and lay it in a close-shut- 
ting and thick stewpan, or saucepan, in which three ounces 
of good butter have been just dissolved, but not allowed to 
boil ; let it simmer slowly over a very gentle fire for two 
hours and a quarter, and turn it when it is rather more than 
half done. Lift it out, skim, and pour the gravy over it; 
send to table with brown gravy, mint sauce, and a salad. 

Saddle of Lamb. — This is a dainty joint for a small party. 
Sprinkle a little salt over it, and set.it in the dripping-pan, 
with a few small pieces of butter on the meat; baste it 



MEATS. 85 

occasionally with tried-out lamb-fat; dredge a little flour 
over it a few minutes before taking from the oven. Ssrve 
with currant jelly and a few choice early vegetables. Mint- 
sauce may be served with the joint, but in a very mild form. 
(See Sauces.) 

Broiled Lamb Chops. — Trim off most of the fat ; broil over 
a brisk fire, turning frequently until the chops are nicely 
browned. Season with pepper and salt, and baste with hot 
butter. Serve on a buttered dish. 

Breaded Lamb Chops. — Grate plenty of stale bread, season 
with salt and pepper, have ready some well-beaten egg, have 
a spider with hot lard ready, take the chops one by one, dip 
into the egg, then into the bread-crumbs ; repeat it, as this 
will be found an improvement; then lay the chops sep- 
arately into the boiling lard, fry brown, and then turn. To 
be eaten with currant jelly. 

Lamb Steaks, Fried — Dip each steak into well-beaten egg, 
cover with bread-crumbs or corn-meal, and fry in butter or 
new lard. Mashed potatoes and boiled rice are a necessary 
accompaniment. The gravy may be thickened with flour 
and butter, adding a little lemon juice ; pour this hot upon 
the steaks, and place the rice in spoonfuls around the dish 
to garnish it. 



IV.— PORK. 



PORK REQUIRES CAREFUL CHOOSING; NEEDS THOROUGH COOH« 
ING. NINETEEN RECIPES FOR COOKING PORK. 

PORK, more than any other meat, requires to be chosen 
with the greatest care. The pig, from its gluttonous 
habits, is particularly liable to disease, and if killed 
and eaten when in an unhealthy condition, those who par- 
take of it will probably pay dearly for their indulgence. 
Dairy-fed pork is the best. 



86 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

If this meat be not thoroughly well-done, it is disgusting 
to the sight and poisonous to the stomach. " In the gravy 
of pork, if there is the least tint of redness," says an emi- 
nent medical authority, " it is enough to appall the sharpest 
appetite. Other meats under-done may be unpleasant, but 
pork is absolutely uneatable." 

RECIPES. 

Roast Pig. — A fat pig about three weeks old is best for a 
roast. Wash it thoroughly inside and out ; chop the liver 
fine with bread-crumbs, onions, parsley, pepper, salt, and 
potatoes boiled and mashed ; make it into a paste with but- 
ter and egg. Put this stuffing into the pig and sew it up ; 
put in a baking-pan with a little water and roast over a 
bright fire, basting well with butter; rub frequently also 
with a piece of lard tied in a clean rag. When thoroughly 
done, lay the pig, back up, in a dish, and put a red apple or 
pickled-mango in its mouth. Make a dressing with some 
of the stuffing, with a glass of wine and some of the drip- 
ping. Serve with the roast pig, and also in a gravy-boat. 

Roast Pork. — Choose for roasting, the loin, the leg, the 
saddle, the fillet, the shoulder, or the spare-rib. The loin 
of young pork is roasted with the skin on, and this should 
be scored in regular strips of about a quarter inch wide 
before the joints are laid to the fire. The skin of the leg 
also should be cut through in the same manner. This will 
prevent blistering, and render it more easy to carve. In 
beginning the roasting the meat should be placed at some 
distance from the fire, in order that it may be heated through 
before the skin hardens. The basting should be constant. 
The cooking must be thorough and the meat well-browned 
before removed from the fire. 

Roast Spare-rib. — Spare-rib should be well rubbed with 
salt and pepper before it is roasted. If large and thick, it 



MEATS. 87 

will require two or three hours to roast ; a very thin piece 
may be roasted in an hour. Lay the thick end to the fire. 
When you put it down to roast, dust on some flour, and 
baste with a little butter. The shoulder, loin, and chine are 
roasted in the same manner. 

Leg of Pork Roasted. — Parboil a leg of pork, take off the 
skin, and then roast ; baste with butter, and make a savoiy 
powder of finely minced or dried or powdered sage, ground 
black pepper, salt, and some bread-crumbs rubbed together 
through a colander ; add to this a little very finely minced 
onion ; sprinkle the meat with this when it is almost done ; 
put a half pint of gravy into the dish. 

Baked Pork Tenderloins. — Split the tenderloin lengthwise 
nearly through ; stuff with a filling of bread-crumbs, pep^ 
per, salt, and sweet marjoram. Tie a string around it, to 
keep the filling in, and bake in a hot oven'for half an hour, 
basting well as the cooking proceeds. 

Pork Cutlets. — Cut them about half an inch thick from a 
delicate loin of pork, trim into neat form, and take off part 
of the fat, or the whole of it when it is not liked ; dredge a 
little pepper or cayenne upon them, and broil (or fry) over 
a clear and moderate fire from fifteen to eighteen minutes, 
sprinkle a little fine salt upon them just before they are 
dished. They may be dipped into egg and then into bread- 
crumbs mixed with minced sage, then finished in the usual 
way. When fried, flour them well, and season with salt and 
pepper. Serve with gravy made in the pan. 

Boiled Ham. — The soaking which must be given to a ham 
before it is boiled depends both on the manner in which it 
has been cured and on its age. If highly salted, hard, and 
old, a day and night, or even longer, may be requisite to 
open the pores sufficiently and to extract a portion of the 
salt. The water must be several times changed during the 
steeping, After the ham has been scraped or brushed as 



88 THE HO USE WIFES L1BRAR Y. 

clean as possible, pare away lightly any part which may be 
blackened or rusty. Lay it into a suitable kettle and cover 
it plentifully with cold water ; bring it very slowly to boil, 
and clear off the scum, which will be thrown up in great 
abundance So soon as the water has been cleared from 
this, draw the pot to the edge of the stove, that the ham 
may be simmered slowly but steadily, until it is tender. On 
no account allow it to boil fast. When it can be probed 
very easily with a sharp skewer, lift it out, strip off the skin, 
and return the ham to the water to cool. 



Ham. — A ham of sixteen pounds must be boiled 
three hours, then skin and rub in half a pound of brown 
sugar, cover with bread-crumbs, and bake well for two 
hours. 

Glazed Ham. — Take a cold-boiled ham from which the skin 
has been removed, and brush it well all over with beaten 
egg. To a cup of powdered cracker allow enough rich 
milk or cream to make into a thick paste, salt it, and work 
in a teaspoonful of melted butter. Spread this evenly, a 
quarter of an inch thick, over the ham, and set to brown in 
a moderate oven. 

Ham and Eggs. — Cut the ham in very thin slices, and fry 
long enough to cook the fat, but not long enough to crisp 
the lean. A very little boiling water may be put into the 
frying-pan to secure the ham moist and tender. Remove 
the ham when it is done, break eggs gently into the pan, 
without breaking the yelks, and fry till done, about three 
minutes. The eggs will not require to be turned. Cut off 
the uneaven edges, place the eggs around the ham, and pour 
in the gravy. 

Ham or Tongue Toast. — Toast a thick slice of bread ana 
butter it on both sides. Take a small quantity of remains 
«tf ham or tongue, grate it, and put it in a stewpan with two 



MEATS. 89 

hard-boiled eggs chopped fine, and mixed with a little but- 
ter, salt, and cayenne ; heat it quite hot, then spread thickly 
upon the buttered toast. Serve while hot. 

Broiled Salt Pork. — Cut the pork in thin slices. Put a lit- 
tle water in the pan, and when it has boiled three minutes 
pour it off; dredge the pork with flour and brown it. 

Bacon Broiled or Fried. — Cut evenly into thin slices, or rash- 
ers ; pare from them all rind and rust ; curl them round ; 
fasten them with small, slight skewers, then gently fry, broil, 
or toast them ; draw out the skewers before they are sent to 
table. A few minutes will dress them either way. They 
may be cooked without being curled. The slow cooking is 
necessary that the meat may be well done without being 
dried or hardened. 

Fried Sausage. — Sausages should be used while quite fresh. 
Melt a piece of butter or dripping in a clean frying-pan ; 
when just melted, put in the sausages, shake the pan for a 
minute, and keep turning them ; do not break or prick 
them ; fry them over a very slow fire till they are nicely 
browned ; when done, lay them on a hair-sieve before the 
fire to drain the fat from them. The secret of cooking sau- 
sages well is to let them heat very gradually. If so done 
the skins will not burst if they are fresh. The common 
practice of pricking them lets the gravy out, which is un- 
desirable. 

Baked Sausages. — The most wholesome way to cook sau- 
sages is to bake them. Place them in a baking-pan in a 
single layer, and bake in a moderate oven ; turn them over 
when half done, that they may be equally browned. Serve 
with pieces of toast between them, having cut the toast 
about the same size as the sausage, and moistened it with a 
little of the sausage fat. 

Sausage Meat. — Many prefer to use sausage meat in bulk. 



§0 HIE tiOUSkWTFE'S LlBkAkV. 

Small portions of the meat should be packed lightly to- 
gether and fried slowly until nicely browned. When done, 
drain through a hair-sieve. Do not pack hard. It will 
make the sausages tough. 

Sorappel. — Boil a hog's head one day, and let it stand five 
or six hours, or all night. Slip out the bones and chop 
fine ; then return the meat to the liquor ; skim when cold ; 
warm and season freely with pepper, salt, sage, and sweet 
herbs. Add two cupfuls of buckwheat-meal and one cup- 
ful of corn-meal. Put into molds, and when cold cut into 
slices and fry for breakfast. 

Boiled Pork. — The shoulder or leg are regarded as the 
most economical pieces for boiling. They should be well 
salted first, by about ten days' pickling. Boil precisely as 
ham is boiled, but not for so long a time, about three hours 
sufficing to thoroughly cook an ordinary sized leg of pork. 
After it has come to the boiling point, let the process pro- 
ceed slowly as possible. Peel off the skin when done and 
spot the surface with dashes of red and black pepper, or 
with allspice, or garnish with parsley. 

Souse. — Pigs' feet and ears may be soused by cleaning 
thoroughly, soaking in salt and water several days, and then 
boiling till the bones can be picked out with ease and the 
skin peeled off! Cover the meat and gelatinous substance 
with boiling vinegar, highly spiced with peppercorns and 
mace. This may be eaten cold or the meat may be fried 
after dipping in egg and cracker. 

Pig's head may be prepared the same way, the meat being 
chopped fine and mixed with pounded crackers. Mix with 
herbs, spices, salt, and pepper to taste, and a small quantity 
of vinegar. Press into a mold, or a jar, and cut in slices. 
To be eaten cold.

POTS FOR COOKING VEGETABLES — VEGETABLES SUITABLE TO 
CERTAIN MEATS. SIXTY RECIPES FOR COOKING VEGETABLES. 

ALL vegetables should be used when fresh as possible. 
Wash them thoroughly, and allow them to lie in cold 
water until ready to be used. 

Great care must be taken to remove gravel and insects 
from heads of lettuce, cabbage, and cauliflower. To do 
this, lay them for half an hour or more in a pan of strong 
brine, placing the stalk ends uppermost. This will destroy 
the small snails and other insects which cluster in the 
leaves, and they will fall out and sink to the bottom. 

Strong-flavored vegetables, like turnips, cabbage, and 
greens, require to be put into a large quantity of water. 
More delicate vegetables, such as peas, asparagus, etc, 
require less water. As a rule, in boiling vegetables, let the 
water boil before putting them in, and let it continue to 
boil until they are done. Nothing is more indigestible than 
vegetables not thoroughly cooked. Just when they are 
done must be ascertained to a certainty in each particulat 
case, without depending upon any general directions. 

Never let boiled vegetables stand in the water after com. 
ing off the fire ; put them instantly into a colander over a 
pot of boiling water, and let them remain there, if you have 
to keep them back from the table. 

An iron pot will spoil the color of the finest greefis ; they 
should be boiled by themselves in a tin, brass, or topper 
vessel.

92 THE HO USE WIFE'S LIB HAS Y. 

Potatoes are good with all meats. Carrots, parsnips, tur- 
nips, greens, and cabbage belong with boiled meats ; beets, 
peas, and beans are appropriate to either boiled or roast. 

RECIPES. 

Boiled White Potatoes. — Peel off a strip about a quarter of 
an inch wide, lengthwise, around each potato. Put them 
on in cold water, with a teaspoonful of salt in it. Let them 
boil fifteen minutes, then pour off half the water and replace 
it with cold water. When the edge of the peel begins to 
curl up they are done. Remove them from the pot, cover 
the bottom of a baking-tin with them, place them in the 
oven, with a towel over them, for fifteen minutes, leaving 
the oven door open. Then serve with or without the skins. 

The use of cold water in boiling potatoes, as in this recipe, 
is exceptional. Hot water is generally used, but for this 
purpose cold seems preferable. 

Roasted White Potatoes. — Select the largest and finest 
potatoes for roasting. Wash them thoroughly and put in 
the oven with their skins on. Roast about one hour, turn- 
ing them occasionally with a fork. When done, send them 
to the table hot, and in their skins. 

Potatoes Roasted with Meats. — To roast potatoes with beef, 
poultry, and other meats, peel the potatoes, lay them in a 
pan, and cook them in the gravy. It is quite proper to 
roast both white and sweet of potatoes in the same pan. 

Mashed Potatoes. — Steam or boil pared potatoes until soft, 
in salted water ; pour off the water and let them drain per- 
fectly dry ; sprinkle with salt and mash ; have ready hot 
milk or cream, in which has been melted a piece of butter ; 
pour this on the potatoes, and stir until white and very light. 
A solid, heavy masher is not desirable. An open wire tool 
is much better. 



VEGETABLES. 93 

Stewed Potatoes. — Take sound raw potatoes, and divide 
each into four parts, or more, if they be very large. Put 
them into the stewpan ; add salt, pepper, and a piece of 
fresh butter; pour in milk, with a little cream, just to keep 
the potatoes from burning. Cover the saucepan, and allow 
the potatoes to stew until thoroughly soft and tender. 

Pried Potatoes. — Boil some good and large potatoes until 
nearly done; set them aside a few minutes; when suffi- 
ciently cool, slice or chop them ; sprinkle them with pepper 
and salt, and fry in butter or fresh lard until they are of a 
light brown color. Serve hot. 

Saratoga Potatoes. — Peel and slice the potatoes on a slaw- 
cutter, into cold water ; wash them thoroughly, and drain ; 
spread between the folds of a clean cloth, rub and pat until 
dry. Fry a few at a time in boiling lard ;_ salt as you take 
them out. Saratoga potatoes are very nice when eaten cold. 
They can be prepared three or four hours before needed, 
and if kept in a warm place they will be crisp and nice. 
They may be used for garnishing game and steaks. 

Potato Cakes. — Mash thoroughly a lot of potatoes just 
boiled ; add a little salt, butter and cream ; fry brown on 
both sides, after making into little cakes. 

Boiled Sweet Potatoes. — Take large, fine potatoes, wash 
clean ; boil with the skins on in plenty of water, but without 
salt. They will take at least one hour. Drain off the water, 
and set them for a few minutes in a tin pan before the fire, 
or in the oven, that they may be well dried. Peel them be- 
fore sending to the table. 

Roasted Sweet Potatoes. — Sweet potatoes are roasted in the 
same manner as white, but they require a little longer time. 

Pried Sweet Potatoes. — Choose large potatoes, half boil 
them, and then, having taken off the skins, cut the potatoes 
W slices and fry in butter, or in nice drippings. 



94 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Stewed Tomatoes. — Pour boiling water on the tomatoes to 
be used, and then peel and slice them. Stew them gently, 
without adding any water, fifteen minutes ; then add some 
pulverized cracker or bread crumbs, sufficient to thicken it 
a little, and salt and pepper to your taste. Stew fifteen min- 
utes longer, and add a large piece of butter. 

The thickening suggested is not essential. Many prefer 
the pure tomatoes. Try both ways and adopt the more 
pleasing. 

Broiled Tomatoes. — Cut large tomatoes in two, from side to 
side, not from top to bottom ; place them on a gridiron, the 
cut surface down ; when well seared, turn them and put on 
butter, salt, and pepper ; then cook with the skin side down 
until done. 

Pried Tomatoes. — Cut the tomatoes in slices without skin- 
ning ; pepper and salt them well ; then sprinkle a little flour 
over them and fry in butter until browned. Put them on a 
hot platter ; then pour milk or cream into the butter and 
juice, and when this is boiling hot, pour it over the tomatoes. 

Tomatoes Baked Whole. — Select a number of sound, ripe 
tomatoes. Cut a round hole in the stem side of each, and 
stuff it with bread-crumbs, nicely peppered and salted ; cover 
the bottom of the pan with the tomatoes, the opened side 
upward ; put in a very little water, dredge with flour, and 
bake till brown. Serve hot. 

Baked Sliced Tomatoes. — Skin the tomatoes, slice in small 
pieces ; spread a thick layer in the bottom of a pudding 
dish ; cover with a thin layer of bread-crumbs, and sprinkle 
salt, pepper, and a few small pieces of butter over them ; 
add another layer of tomatoes, then of crumbs, etc., until 
the dish is filled ; sprinkle over the top a layer of fine rolled 
crackers ; bake one hour. Canned tomatoes, put up whole, 
may be used nicely this way, 



VEGETABLES. 95 

Tomatoes a la Creme. — Pare and slice ripe tomatoes ; one 
pound of fresh ones or a quart can ; stew until perfectly 
smooth, season with salt and pepper, and add a piece of but- 
ter the size of an egg. Just before taking from the fire, stir 
in one cup of cream, with a tablespoonful of flour stirred 
smooth in a part of it ; do not let it boil after the flour is put 
in. Have ready in a dish some pieces of toast ; pour the 
tomatoes over this and serve. 

Boiled Green Corn. — Take off the outside leaves and the 
silk, letting the innermost leaves remain on until after the 
corn is boiled, which renders the corn much sweeter. Boil 
for half an hour in plenty of water, drain, and after fully re- 
moving the leaves, serve. 

Baked Corn. — Grate one dozen ears of sweet corn, one cup 
of milk, a small piece of butter ; salt to taste, and bake in a 
pudding dish for one hour. 

Corn Fritters, see Fritters. 

Lima Beans. — Shell, wash, and put into boiling water; 
when boiled tender, drain and season them. Dress with 
cream, or with a large lump of butter, and let the whole 
simmer for a few moments before serving. 

Succotash. — Take ten ears of green corn and one pint of 
Lima beans ; cut the corn from the cob, and stew gently 
with the beans until tender. Use as little water as possible. 
Season with butter, salt, and pepper — milk, if you choose. 
If a few of the cobs are stewed in the succotash, it will 
improve the flavor, as there is great sweetness in the cob. 

String Beans. — Remove the strings of the beans with a 
knife, and cut off both ends. Cut each bean into three 
pieces, boil tender, add butter when they are done, pepper 
and salt, and serve hot. 

Boiled Beans. — Dried beans must soak over night in soft 
water ; put them in a strong bag, leaving room for them to 



96 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

swell ; let them boil in a plenty of water until done ; hang 
up the bag that all the water may drain off; then season 
with butter, pepper, and salt to the taste. 

Baked Beans. — Put the beans to soak early in the evening, 
in a dish that will allow plenty of water to be used. Change 
the water at bed-time. Next morning early, parboil two 
hours ; pour off nearly all the water ; take raw pork, scored 
on top ; put the beans in a deep dish, a stoneware jar is very 
nice, the pork in the middle, sinking it so as to have it just 
level with the surface. Add half a teaspoonful of soda, two 
tablespoonfuls of molasses, and bake at least six hours. As 
the beans bake dry, add more water, a little at a time, until 
the last hour, when it is not necessary to moisten them. 

Boiled Green Peas. — The peas should be young and freshly 
shelled ; wash and drain them carefully ; put them into fast- 
boiling, salted water ; when quite tender drain, and add pep- 
per, butter, and a little milk. Serve hot. 

Boiled Asparagus. — Scrape the stems of the asparagus 
lightly, but make them very clean, throwing them into cold 
water as you proceed. When all are scraped, tie them in 
bunches of equal size ; cut the hard ends evenly, that all 
may be of the same length, and put into boiling water. 
Prepare several slices of delicately browned toast half an 
inch thick. When the stalks are tender, lift them out and 
season with pepper and salt. Dip the toast quickly into the 
liquor in which the asparagus was boiled, and dish the veg- 
etable upon it, the points, or the butts, meeting in the cen- 
tre of the dish. Pour rich melted butter over it, and send 
to the table hot. 

Boiled Beets. — Wash, but do not cut them, as cutting de- 
stroys the sweetness ; let them boil from two to three hours, 
or until they are perfectly tender ; then take them up, peel 
and slice them, and pour vinegar, or melted butter, ovet 
them, as may be preferred.

Potato Hillocks. — Whip boiled potatoes light with a 
little butter and milk, and season with salt and pepper. 
Beat in a raw egg, to bind the mixture ; shape into small 
conical heaps, set in a greased pan in the oven, and as 
they brown, glare with butter. The oven must be very- 
hot. • Slip a cake-turner under each hillock and transfer 
to a hot platter. — Marion Harland. 

Potato Pie. — Pare and cut four good-sized potatoes 
into dice, cover them with boiling water, boil ten min- 
utes, drain. Add to them one tablespoonful chopped 
parsley, one of chopped ham and one of chopped onion. 
Season with salt and pepper and turn into a baking dish. 
Add one teaspoonful of baking powder and a half of 
salt to one pint of flour, mix and add sufficient milk to 
make a soft dough. Roll out and cover the top of the 
baking dish, just as you would an ordinary pie. Brush 
with milk and bake in a quick oven twenty minutes. 
Serve hot with cream sauce. — Mrs. S. T. Rorer. 

Stuffed Onions. — Select large onions, the Spanish va- 
riety preferred, and cook them in a steamer until tender, 
but not broken. Let them cool, then cut off a slice 
from the top and scoop out the inside, leaving not more 
than two or three layers. Chop the part removed, and 
chop with it some sweet green pepper (one teaspoon for 
each onion). Into the onion cups put several boiled 
chestnuts (shelled), and fill the spaces with the chopped 
mixture. Add a teaspoon of butter and a little salt, and 
stand the onions in a pan of water. Bake until very 
soft, and when nearly done cover the top with buttered 
cracker crumbs and return to the oven until the crumbs 
are crisp. When the crumbs are crisp, have ready a 
tomato sauce and pour it over them on the serving dish. 
— Mrs. Lincoln.

Pried Egg-plant — Pare and cut in slices quarter of an incl* 
thick ; sprinkle with salt ; cover and let stand for an hour. 
Pour off the juice or water which exudes; wipe each slice 
diy ; dip first in beaten egg, then in rolled cracker or bread 
crumbs. Season with pepper and salt, and fry brown in but- 
ter. Serve very hot. 

Fried Egg-plant No. 2. — Put into water and boil until soft, 
then cut in two and scoop out all the inside ; season ; take 
a tablespoonful of the remaining pulp at a time, dip in egg 
and bread-crumbs, and fry in hot lard. Serve hot. 

Baked Egg-plant. — Boil them till somewhat tender, in order 
to remove the bitter flavor. Then slit each one down the 
side, and take out the seeds. Have ready a stuffing made 
of grated cracker, butter, minced herbs, salt, pepper, nut- 
meg, and beaten yelk of eggs. Fill with this the cavity left 
by the seeds, and bake the plants in a hot oven. Serve with 
well-seasoned gravy poured around them in the dish. 

Boiled Cabbage. — Strip off the loose or withered leaves, and 
wash well ; then split in two, or if the head be veiy large, 
into four pieces, and put into boiling water with some salt ; 
let it boil slowly, skimming carefully and frequently. When 
done, strain, through a colander. Serve in a vegetable-dish 
and lay inside, among the leaves, some bits of butter ; sea- 
son with" pepper, and serve while hot. 

Boiled Cauliflower.— Trim off all the outside leaves; wrap 
in a cloth and put into boiling water well salted ; boil until 
tender, and then serve with drawn butter. 

Cabbage a la Cauliflower. — Cut the cabbage fine, as for 
slaw ; put it into a stewpan, cover with water, and keep 
closely covered ; when tender, drain off the water ; put in a 
small piece of butter, with a little salt, one-half a cupful of 
cream, or one cupful of milk. Leave on the stove a few 
minutes before serving.

Boiled Turnips. — Pare and cut into pieces ; put them into 
boiling water well salted, and boil until tender ; drain thor- 
oughly and then mash and add a piece of butter, pepper, 
and salt to taste. Stir until they are thoroughly mixed, and 
serve hot. 

Boiled Onions. — Skin them carefully and put them to boil ; 
when they have boiled a few minutes, pour off the water, 
add clean cold water, and then set them to boil again, 
Pour this away also, and add more cold water, when they 
may boil till done. This change of waters will make them 
white and clear, and very mild in flavor. After they are 
done, pour off all the water, and dress with a little cream, 
salt, and pepper to taste. 

Pried Onions. — Peel and slice fresh, solid onions very 
evenly, then fry them in a pan of hot butter till slightly 
browned. 

Boiled Leeks. — Trim off the coarser leaves of young leeks, 
cut them into equal lengths, tie them in small bunches, and 
boil in plenty of water, previously salted. Serve on toast, 
and send melted butter to the table with them. 

Boiled Squash. — Remove the seeds ; boil till very tender ; 
then press out all the water through a colander, and mash, 
with butter, pepper, and salt. 

Pried Squash. — Pare the squash, cut in slices, dip in egg 
seasoned with pepper and salt, then into cracker dust, and 
fry to a nice brown. 

Boiled Parsnips. — Scrape thoroughly, then wash and boil 
in a little water well salted. When done, dress with butter 
and a little pepper, or drawn butter, if desired. 

Fried Parsnips. — Having boiled your parsnips, split open 
the largest ones, season with pepper and salt, dredge a littla 
flour over them, and fry to a light brown,

Boiled Spinach. — Boil the spinach in plenty of water, drain, 
and press the moisture from it ; chop it small, put it into a 
clean saucepan, with a slice of fresh butter, and stir the 
whole until well mixed and very hot. Smooth it in a dish, 
and send it quickly to table. 

Boiled Greens. — Turnip-tops, mustard-tops, cabbage-leaves, 
beet-tops, cowslips, dandelions, and various similar articles 
are much relished in the spring, boiled in salt and water or 
with salt pork. When done sufficiently they will sink to 
the bottom. 

Stewed Celery. — Clean the heads thoroughly ; take off the 
coarse, green, outer leaves ; cut the stalks into small pieces, 
and stew in a little broth ; when tender, add some rich 
cream, a little flour, and butter enough to thicken the 
cream. Season with pepper, salt, and a little nutmeg, if 
that is agreeable. 

Boiled Artichokes. — Soak the artichokes and wash them in 
several waters ; cut the stalks even ; trim away the lower 
leaves, and the ends of the other leaves; boil in salted 
water with the tops downward, and let them remain until 
the leaves can be easily drawn out. Before serving, remove 
the surrounding leaves, and send the remainder to the table 
with melted butter. 

Broiled Mushrooms. — In order to test mushrooms, sprinkle 
salt on the gills ; if they turn yellow, they are poisonous ; if 
they turn black, they are good. When satisfied at this 
point, pare, and cut off the stems, dip them in melted butter, 
season with salt and pepper, broil them on both sides over 
a clear fire, and serve on toast. 

Stewed Mushrooms. — Being sure you have the genuine 
mushrooms, put them in a small saucepan, season with 
pepper and salt, add a spoonful of butter and a spoonful or 
two of gravy from roast meat, or, if this be not at hand, the

same quantity of good, rich cream ; shake them about over 
the fire, and when they boil they are done. 

Boiled Rice. — Wash a cupful of rice in two or three 
waters ; let it lie for a few minutes in the last water, then 
put it into three quarts of fast-boiling water, with a little 
salt ; let it boil twenty minutes, then turn into a colander, 
drain, and serve, using such sauce or dressing as may be 
desired. 

Boiled Hominy. — Soak one cupful of fine hominy over 
night in three cupfuls of water, and salt to taste ; in the 
morning turn it into a quart pail ; then put the pail into a 
kettle of boiling water, cover tightly, and steam one hour ; 
add one teacupful of sweet milk, and boil fifteen minutes 
additional, then serve hot. 

Stewed Macaroni — Break the macaroni into small pieces, 
wash it, and put into salted hot water ; cook about twenty 
minutes; drain, and put in a vegetable dish a layer of 
macaroni, sprinkle with grated cheese, bits of butter, pepper 
and salt ; proceed in this manner until the dish is full, but 
omit the cheese at the last. Set the dish in the oven for a 
few minutes, and let it get thoroughly hot. 

Baked Macaroni — For baked macaroni, proceed as in 
stewed, but, when prepared fully as above, pour a few 
spoonfuls of milk over the top, and bake half an hour. 

Macaroni with Tomatoes. — Have water boiling in a large 
saucepan; throw into it macaroni, broken, bJt not too short; 
let it cook twenty to thirty minutes, pour over it some cold 
water, and strain it quite dry ; cut an onion into small dice, 
throw it into cold water and squeeze it dry in a cloth ; put 
some olive oil, butter, or clarified fat into a saucepan ; the 
oil, of course, is best. Throw into it the onion, and let it 
nook, shaking occasionally, until the onion is almost melted 
»way. Have some cooked tomatoes ready to add to this 



102 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

sauce. If it is too thick, add some cold water by teaspoon- 
fuls at a time. Let all simmer for ten minutes longer. 
Sprinkle some grated cheese over your macaroni, which 
must be piping hot, in a dish. Pour the sauce over this and 
serve. A quarter of a pound of macaroni makes a large 
dish, and takes about a third of a can to half a can of 
tomatoes. 

Sliced Cucumbers. — Peel and slice the cucumbers as thin as 
possible ; lay the slices in salted water for an hour ; then 
pour off the water; cover them with vinegar, half a tea- 
spoonful of pepper, and salt as may be necessary. 

Stewed Oyster-plant. — Cut off the tops of a bunch of 
salsify, or oyster-plant, close to the root ; scrape and wash 
well, and slice lengthwise or round ; stew until tender in 
salted water ; drain and put in a stewpan, cover with milk ; 
to one pint of salsify add a tablespoonful of butter rolled in 
flour ; season with salt and pepper ; let it stew a few min- 
utes and add a little vinegar, if liked. 

Mock Pried Oysters. — Scrape one bunch of salsify, and boil 
until tender ; mash through a colander, add one beaten egg, 
a small piece of butter, salt and pepper to taste; drop by the 
spoonful into hot lard and fry brown. 

Egg-Plant. — Cut the plant into slices one-third of an 
inch thick, without removing the skin. Sprinkle salt 
over each slice, pile them, and cover with a weight to 
press out the juice. Drain, and dip each slice first in 
fine crumbs, then in beaten egg, and again in crumbs, 
and saute them in hot fat. — The Peerless Cook Book : 
Mrs. D. A. Lincoln. Roberts Brothers, Publishers. 

Water-Cresses. — Wash well, pick off decayed leaves, 
and leave in ice-water until you are ready to eat them. 
They should then be shaken free of wet and piled light- 
ly in a glass dish. Eat with salt. — Marion Harland.

VII.— SALADS AND SAUCES. 

SALADS DEFINED — HOW DRESSED, COMBINED, AND SERVED. 
SAUCES DEFINED — 'I HEIR USES AND COMPOSITION. HOW TO 
PREPARE INGREDIENTS FOR SALADS, WHAT VEGETABLES TO 
EMPLOY, FRESHNESS, EXCELLENCE, ETC. THIRTY-SIX RECIPES 
FOR SALADS AND SAU.CES. 

UNDER the head of salads all preparations of uncooked 
herbs or vegetables is placed. They are usually 
dressed with salt, vinegar, oil, and spices. Sometimes 
they are combinad with meat or shell fish, as chicken, veal, 
lobster, etc. They are used chiefly as relishes with other 
food. 

Sauces are generally used to impart a relish to articles 
of food. Sometimes vegetables are employed as the basis 
of sauces, but they are compounded chiefly of savory con- 
diments, that they may add zest to eating. 

Meat or fish used in salads should not be minced, but 
rather picked apart, or cut in pieces of moderate size. Cab- 
bage, celery, asparagus, cauliflower, water-cress, and all 
kinds of lettuce are the vegetables best adapted for use in 
salads. They must be used when quite fresh and crisp, and 
all the ingredients used in their dressing must be of the 
best quality and flavor. 

All condiments are in some sense sauces, but the term is 
usually confined to those which are the result of compound- 
ing a variety of articles. 

RECIPES. 

Coldslaw. — With a sharp knife, or, better, with a knife 
made for the purpose, cut up into fine shavings a firm head 
of cabbage; sprinkle with as much salt and pepper as you 



104 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

deem necessary; beat up the yelk of one egg, add a lump 
of butter the size of a walnut, a gill of cream, the same 
quantity of vinegar, a tablcspoonful of sugar, an even tea- 
spoonful of mustard, and a pinch of bruised celery seed. 
Heat these condiments together, without boiling, and pour 
over the sliced cabbage ; then toss it with a fork until thor- 
oughly mixed. Allow time for it to cool before serving. 

Coldslaw, No. 2.— Take equal parts of chopped cabbage 
and the green stalks of celery. Season with salt, pepper, 
and vinegar. 

Maryland Coldslaw. — Halve the cabbage and lay it in cold 
water for one hour ; shave down the head into small slips 
with a sharp knife. Put in a saucepan a cup of vinegar, and 
let it boil ; then add a cup of cream, with the yelks of two 
eggs, well beaten ; let it boil up, and pour over the cabbage. 
As soon as the cabbage is cut it should be sprinkled with a 
little salt and pepper. 

Cabbage Salad. — Take one head of fine, white cabbage, 
minced fine ; three hard-boiled eggs ; two tablespoonfuls 
of salad oil ; two teaspoonfuls white sugar ; one teaspoonful 
salt ; one teaspoonful pepper; one teaspoonful made mustard; 
one teacupful vinegar. Mix and pour upon the chopped 
cabbage. 

Lettuce Salad.— Take a good-sized head of lettuce and pull 
the leaves apart. Wash them a moment, then shake oft" the 
water and dry the leaves. Examine them carefully, wipe 
off all grit, and reject those that are bruised. Take the yelks 
of two hard-boiled eggs ; add one-half teaspoonful of mixed 
mustard, and mix to a paste with a silver fork ; then add 
slowly, mixing carefully, about one-half a cup of vinegar, 
one teaspoonful of sugar, and salt to taste ; cut the lettuce 
small as may be desired with a sharp knife, and pour the 
dressing over it ; garnish w>h hard-boiled eggs. 



SALADS AND SAUCES. JOfl 

Potato Salad. — Steam and slice the potatoes ; add a very 
little raw onion chopped very fine, and a little parsley, and 
pour over the whole a nice salad dressing. Serve either 
warm or cold, as may be preferred. 

Potato Salad, No. 2. — Cut up three quarts of boiled potatoes. 
while hot, into neat pieces ; add a tablespoonful of chopped 
parsley, a tablespoonful of chopped onion, a teaspoonful of 
pepper, and one of salt ; also add a cupful of oil, and mix ; 
then add a cupful of warm stock, a wineglassful of vinegar 
(from the mixed-pickle bottle) ; mix the ingredients together 
carefully, and do not break the potatoes any more than is 
absolutely unavoidable. Set the whole in the ice-box and 
serve cold. The onion and parsley may be omitted, and 
boiled root celery added, or a little stalk celery chopped fine. 

Chicken Salad. — Boil a small chicken until very tender. 
When entirely cold, remove the skin and fat, cut the meat 
into small bits, then cut the white part of the stalks of celery 
into pieces of similar size, until you have twice as much 
celery as meat. Mix the chicken and celery together; pour 
on Slade's Salad Cream, and stir all thoroughly. Cold 
veal used in place of chicken will also make a very excel- 
lent salad. 

Chicken Salad, No. 2. — Take three chickens, boil until very 
tender ; when cold, chop them, but not too fine ; add twice 
the quantity of celery cut fine, and three hard-boiled eggs 
sliced. Make a dressing with two cups of vinegar, half a 
cup of butter (or two tablespoonfuls of oil), two eggs 
beaten, with a large tablespoonful of mustard, saltspoonful of 
salt, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, tablespoonful of pepper, 
or a little cayenne pepper ; put the vinegar into a tin pan

dients together thoroughly and stir slowly into the vinegar 
until it thickens. Cool it and pour over the salad just be- 
fore serving.

Tomato Sauce, — Halve the tomatoes and squeeze out 

the seeds and watery pulp. Stew the solid portions gently

towel, strip off the leaves, and chop them very fine ; put in 
a sauce-boat with a cupful of vinegar and four lumps of

a pint of drawn butter, with two raw eggs beaten into it ; 
add the asparagus, and season, squeezing in the lemon juice 
last. The butter must be hot, but do not cook after putting

fowls, stewed fillet of veal, or boiled mutton. 

Mushroom Sauce. — Pick, rub, and wash a pint of young 
mushrooms, and sprinkle with salt to take off the skin. Put

tablespoonfuls of lobster meat chopped fine, the juice of half 
a lemon, and serve. 

Oyster Sauce. — Strain fifty oysters ; put the juice into a 
saucepan ; add one pint of new milk ; let it simmer, and 
then skim off whatever froth may rise. Rub a large spoon- 
ful of flour and two of butter together ; stir this into the 
liquor ; add a little salt and pepper. Let this simmer five 
minutes, but do not add the oysters till just as they are to 
be sent to the table, as oysters much cooked are hard. For 
turkeys, etc., this is a splendid dressing. 

Plain French Dressing. — A plain French dressing is made 
simply of salt, pepper, oil, and vinegar. Three tablespoon- 
fuls of oil to one of vinegar, saltspoon heaping full of salt, 
an even saltspoonful of pepper mixed with a little cayenne.

VIII.— CROQUETTES AND FRITTERS. 



CROQUETTES DEFINED J FRITTERS DEFINED J USES OF BOTH. 
TWENTY-FOUR RECIPES FOR CROQUETTES AND FRITTERS. 

THE term croquette (pronounced cro-ket) is from a French 
verb, meaning " to crunch." It designates all that class 
of preparations made of minced meat, or other in- 
gredients, highly seasoned and fried in bread-crumbs. 

Fritters, like croquettes, are fried, but they are made of 
batter containing other ingredients, as taste may dictate. 
Both these preparations are used as accessories of the din- 
ner or tea table rather than as principal dishes. 

RECIPES. 

Rice Croquettes. — Put a quarter of a pound of rice into a 
pint of milk. Let it simmer gently until the rice is tender 
and the milk absorbed. It must then be boiled until thick 
and dry, or it will be difficult to mold. Add three table- 
spoonfuls of sugar, one of butter, one egg, and flavor to taste 
with vanilla or cinnamon ; beat thoroughly for a few minutes, 
and when cold form into balls or cones, dip these into 
beaten egg, roll lightly in bread-crumbs, and fry in hot butter. 

Hominy Croquettes. — To a cupful of cold boiled hominy 
(small grained) add a tablespoonful of melted butter and stir 
hard; moisten by degrees with a cupful of milk, beating to a 
soft, light paste. Put in a teaspoonful of white sugar and a 
well-beaten egg. Roll into oval balls with floured hands, 
dip in beaten egg, then in cracker-crumbs, and fry in hot 
lard. 

Ill 



112 THE HOUSEWIFE S~LIBRARY. 

Potato Croquettes. — Season cold mashed potatoes with pep- 
per, salt, and nutmeg. Beat to a cream, with a tablespoon- 
ful of melted butter to every cupful of potato. Add two or 
three beaten eggs and some minced parsley. Roll into small 
balls; dip in beaten egg, then in bread-crumbs and fry in 
hot lard. 

Oyster-Plant Croquettes. — Wash, scrape, and boil the oyster- 
plant till tender ; rub it through a colander, and mix with 
the pulp a little butter, cream, salt, cayenne, and lemon juice ; 
mix the ingredients thoroughly together to a smooth paste, 
and set the dish in the ice-box to get cold ; then shape it 
into small cones, dip them in beaten egg, roll in crumbs, 
and fry crisp and brown. 

Chicken Croquettes. — Add to the quantity of minced chicken; 
about one-quarter the quantity of bread-crumbs, also one 
egg well beaten to each cupful of meat ; pepper, salt, and 
chopped parsley to taste, add the yelks of two hard-boiled 
eggs rubbed smooth. Add gravy or drawn butter to moisten 
it, make into cones or balls, roll in cracker-dust or flour, 
and fry in hot lard. 

Veal Croquettes. — Make these the same as chicken cro- 
quettes, by substituling for the chicken cold minced veal and 
ham in equal parts. The salt may be omitted, as the 
ham usually supplies it sufficiently. Turkey, duck, or the 
remains of any cold game or meat may be used in the same 
way with very satisfactory results. 

Oyster Croquettes. — Take the hard ends of the oysters, leav- 
ing the other end for a soup or stew ; scald them, then chop 
fine, and add an equal weight of potatoes rubbed through a 
colander ; to one pound of this combination add two ounces 
of butter, one teaspoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful of pep- 
per, half a teaspoonful of mace, and one-half gill of cream, 
make in small rolls, dip them in egg and grated bread, fry 
in deep, hot lard. 



CROQUETTES AND FRITTERS. H3 

Lobster Croquettes.— Chop the lobster very fine ; mix with 
pepper, salt, bread-crumbs, and a little parsley; moisten 
with cream and a small piece of butter ; shape with your 
hands ; dip in egg, roll in bread-crumbs, fry in hot lard. 

Plain Fritters. — Take one pint of flour, four eggs, one 
pint of boiling water, and one teaspoonful of salt. Stir the 
flour into the boiling water gradually, and let it boil three 
minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from the fire and 
stir in the yelks of the eggs, afterward the whites, they hav- 
ing been well beaten. Drop this batter by large spoon- 
fuls into boiling lard and fry to a light brown. Serve hot, 
powdered with white sugar. 

Bread Fritters. — Grate stale bread until you have a pint of 
crumbs ; pour a pint of boiling rnilk upon these, a table- 
spoonful of butter having been dissolved in it, and let the 
whole stand for an hour. Then beat up the mixture and 
flavor with nutmeg. Stir in gradually a quarter pound of 
white sugar, two tablespoonfuls of brandy, six well-beaten 
eggs, and currants enough to flavor the whole. The cur- 
rants should be washed, dried, and floured. Drop by large 
spoonfuls into boiling lard and fry to a light brown. Serve 
with wine and powdered sugar. 

Potato Fritters. — Break open four nicely baked potatoes ; 
scoop out the insides with a spoon, and mix with them a 
wineglassful of cream, a tablespoonful of brandy, two table- 
spoonfuls of powdered sugar, the juice of one lemon, half a 
teaspoonful of vanilla extract, and well-beaten yelks of four 
and the whites of three eggs ; beat the batter until it is quite 
smooth ; drop large tablespoonfuls of the mixture into boil- 
ing fat and fry to a light brown ; dust them with powdered 
sugar and send to table hot. 

Corn Fritters. — Scrape twelve ears of corn, mix with two

eggs, one and one-half cups of milk, salt and pepper to taste, 
and flour enough to hold all together. Fry in hot fat. 

Hominy Fritters. — Two teacupfuls of cold boiled hominy ; 
stir in one teacupful of sweet milk and a little salt, four table- 
spoonfuls of sifted flour, and one egg ; beat the white sepa- 
rately and add last ; drop the batter by spoonfuls in hot lard 
and fry to a nice brown. 

Eic8 Fritters. — Boil a quarter of a pound of rice in milk 
till it is tender, then mix it with a pint of milk, two eggs, 
one cup of sugar, a little salt and cinnamon, and as much 
flour as will make a thick batter. Fry them in thin cakes 
and serve with butter and white powdered sugar. 

Parsnip Fritters. — Boil four good-sized parsnips in salted 
water until tender ; drain them, beat them to a pulp, and 
squeeze the water from -them as much as possible ; bind 
them together with a beaten egg and a little flour. Shape 
into cakes and fry in hot lard. 

Fruit Fritters. — The following recipe will serve for many 
kinds of fruit or vegetable fritters : Make a batter of ten 
ounces of flour, half a pint of milk, and two ounces of but- 
ter ; sweeten and flavor to taste ; stir in the whites of two 
eggs well beaten; dip the fruit in the batter and fry. Small 
fruit and vegetables should be mixed with the batter. 

Apple Fritters. — Take one egg, two tablespoonfuls of flour, 
a little sifted sugar and ginger, with milk enough to make 
a smooth batter ; cut a good sized apple into slices and put 
them into the batter. Put them into a frying-pan, with the 
batter which is taken up in the spoon. When fried, drain 
them on a sieve and sift on powdered sugar. 

Currant Fritters. — Take twocupfuls dry, fine bread-crumbs, 
two tablespoonfuls prepared flour, two cups of milk, one- 
half pound currants, washed and well dried; five eggs 



CROQUETTES AND FRITTERS. H5 

whipped very light and the yelks strained, one-half cup pow- 
dered sugar, one tablespoonful butter, one-half teaspoonful 
mixed cinnamon arid nutmeg. Boil the milk and pour over 
the bread. Mix and put in the butter. Let it get cold. 
Beat in, next, the yelks and sugar, the seasoning, flour, and 
stiff whites, finally the currants dredged white with flour. 
The batter should be thick. Drop great spoonfuls into 
the hot lard and fry. Drain them and send hot to table. 
Eat with a mixture of wine and powdered sugar. 

Oyster Fritters. — Take one and one-half pints of sweet 
milk, one and one-fourth pounds of flour, four egg (the yelks 
having been beaten very thick) ; add milk and flour ; stir 
the whole well together, then beat the whites to a stiff froth 
and stir them gradually into the batter ; take a spoonful of 
the mixture, drop an oyster into it, and fry in hot lard ; let 
them be a light brown on both sides. 

Clam Fritters. — Take a dozen chopped clams, one pint of 
milk, three eggs. Add liquor from the clams, with salt and 
pepper, and flour enough to produce thin batter. Fry in 
hot lard. 

Cream Fritters. — Take one cup of cream, the whites of five 
eggs, two full cups prepared flour, one saltspoonful of nut- 
meg, a pinch of salt. Stir the whites into the cream in turn 
with the flour, put in nutmeg and salt, beat all hard for two 
minutes. The batter should be rather thick. Fry in plenty 
of sweet lard, a spoonful of batter for each fritter. Drain and 
serve upon a hot, clean napkin. Eat with jelly sauce. Do 
not cut them open, but break or pull them apart. 

French Fritters. — Take two cupfuls of flour, two teaspoon 
fuls of baking powder, two eggs, milk enough for stiff 
batter, and a little salt. Drop into boiling lard and fry light 
brown. Serve with cream and sugar or sauce.

Spanish Fritters. — Cut stale bread into small, round slices 
about an inch thick ; soak them in milk, and then dip them 
into well-beaten egg which has been sweetened to taste. 
Sprinkle thickly with cinnamon and fry in hot lard. 

Venetian Fritters. — Take three ounces of whole rice, wash 
and drain into a pint of cold milk. Let it come slowly to a 
boil, stirring often, and let it simmer till quite thick and dry. 
Add two ounces of powdered sugar, one of fresh butter, a 
pinch of salt, the grated rind of half a lemon. Let the 
whole cool in the saucepan, and while still a little warm 
mix in three ounces of currants, four ounces of chopped 
apples, a teaspoonful of flour, and three well-beaten eggs. 
Drop the batter in small lumps into boiling fat, allowing 
them to fry till the under side is quite firm and brown ; then 
turn and brown the other side. When done, drain through 
a hair sieve, and powder with white sugar when about tc

IX.— EGGS. 



NUTRITIOUS VALUE OF EGGS — TEST OF FRESHNESS — PACKING EGGS 
— PRESERVING EGGS. THIRTY-THREE WAYS OF COOKING EGGS. 

HIGH chemical authorities agree that there is more nutri- 
ment in an egg than in any substance of equal bulk 
found in nature or produced by art. They are much 
used for food the world over, and few articles are capable 
of more varied employment. 

The freshness of an egg may be determined in various 
ways. In a fresh egg, the butt end, if touched on the 
tongue, is sensibly warmer than the point end. If held to- 
ward the light and looked through (" candled "), a fresh egg 
will show a clear white and a well-rounded yelk. A stale 
egg will appear muddled. Probably the surest test is to put 
the eggs into a pan of cold water. Fresh eggs sink quickly ; 
bad eggs float ; suspicious ones act suspiciously, neither 
sinking nor floating very decidedly. Of all articles of food, 
doubtful eggs are most certainly to be condemned. 

On the packing of eggs, the following conclusions may 
be regarded as established among egg-dealers : By cold 
storage, temperature forty to forty-two degrees Fahrenheit, 
kept uniform, with eggs packed properly or in cases, they 
will keep in good condition from six to nine months ; but 
they must be used soon after being taken out of the cold 
storage, as they soon spoil. Eggs become musty from being 
packed in bad material. They will become musty in cases, 
as a change of temperature causes the eggs to sweat and 
the wrapping-paper to become moist and taint the eggs. 

117 



118 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Well-dried oats, a year old, makes the best packing. Eggs 
become " mixed " by jarring in shipping. Fresh eggs mix 
worse than those kept in cold storage. Eggs which have 
been held in cold storage in the West should be shipped in 
refrigerator cars in summer. Eggs will keep thirty days 
longer if stood on the little end than in any other position. 
They must be kept at an even temperature and in a pure 
atmosphere. Eggs laid on the side attach to the shell and 
are badly injured. To prevent imposition as to the freshness 
of the eggs, the egg gatherers should " candle " them when 
they get them from the farmers. Eggs keep better in the 
dark than in the light. 

Methods of preservation for domestic purposes are, to 
pack them in bran or salt, the small end down ; to grease 
them with linseed oil, or dip them in a light varnish. For 
extra long keeping, slack one pound of lime in a gallon of 
water ; when this is entirely cold, place it in a jar and fill 
with fresh eggs. Do not agitate the contents when eggs 
are removed from the jar. Eggs kept so will continue good 
for a year. 

The French method of preserving eggs is to dissolve 
beeswax and olive oil and anoint the eggs all over. If left 
undisturbed in a cool place, they will remain good for two 
years. 

RECIPES. 

Boiled Eggs. — Put into a saucepan of boiling water with a 
tablespoon, being careful not to break or crack them. Boil 
steadily three minutes, if you want them soft ; ten, if hard. 

Another way is to put them on in cold water, and let it 
come to a boil. The inside, white and yelk, will be then of 
the consistency of custard. 

Still another way is to put them in water, heated to the 
boiling point, and let them stand from five to seven minutes 
without boiling. If desired for salad, boil them ten minutes; 



EGGS. 119 

then throw them in cold water ; roll them gently on a table 
or board, and the shell can be easily removed. Wire egg 
racks, to set in boiling hot water with the eggs held in place, 
are exceedingly convenient. 

Boiled Eggs, with Sauce. — Boil hard, remove the shell, set 
in a hot dish, and serve with seasoning and sauce to taste. 

Poached Eggs.— Have the water well salted, but do not let 
it boil hard. Break the eggs separately into a saucer, and 
slip them singly into the water ; when nicely done, remove 
with a skimmer, trim neatly, and lay each egg upon a small 
thin square of buttered toast, then sprinkle with salt and 
pepper. Some persons prefer them poached rather than 
fried with ham ; in which case substitute the ham for toast. 

Poached Eggs with Ham Sauce. — Mince fine two or three 
slices of boiled ham, a small onion, a little parsley, pepper, 
and salt ; stew together for a quarter of an hour ; put the 
poached eggs in a dish, squeeze over them the juice of a 
lemon, and pour on the sauce hot but not boiling. 

Poached Eggs a la Creme. — Nearly fill a clean frying-pan 
with water boiling hot ; strain a tablespoonful of vinegar 
through double muslin, and add to the water with a little 
salt. Slip your eggs from the saucer upon the top of the 
water (first taking the pan from the fire). Boil three min- 
utes and a half; drain, and lay on buttered toast in a hot 
dish. Turn the water from the pan and pour in half a cup- 
ful of cream or milk. If you use the latter, thicken with a 
very little corn-starch. Let it heat to a boil, stirring to pre- 
vent burning, and add a great spoonful of butter, some pep- 
per, and salt. Boil up once and pour over the eggs. Or 
better still, heat the milk in a separate saucepan, that the 
eggs may not have to stand. A little broth improves the 
sauce. 



120 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Steamed Eggs. — Butter a tin plate and break in your eggs ; 
set in a steamer ; place over a kettle of boiling water, and 
steam until the whites are cooked; they are more orna. 
mental when broken into patty tins, as they keep their form 
better ; the whites of the eggs, when cooked in this manner, 
are tender and light, and not tough and leathery, as if cooked 
by any other process. 

Eggs in .this style can be eaten by invalids, and are very 
much richer than by any other method. 

Whirled Eggs. — Put a quart of water, slightly salted, into 
a saucepan over the fire, and keep it at a fast boil. Stir 
with wooden spoon or ladle in one direction until it whirls 
rapidly. Break six eggs, one at a time, into a cup and drop 
each carefully into the centre, or vortex, of the boiling water. 
If kept at a rapid motion, the egg will become a soft, round 
ball. Take it out carefully with a perforated spoon, and put 
it on a slice of buttered toast laid upon a hot dish. Put a 
bit of butter on the top. Set the dish in the oven to keep 
warm, and proceed in the same way with another egg, hav- 
ing but one in the saucepan at a time. When all are done, 
dust lightly with salt and pepper and send up hot. 

Eggs a la Mode. — Remove the skin from a dozen tomatoes, 
medium size, cut them up in a saucepan, add a little butter, 
pepper, and salt ; when sufficiently boiled, beat up five or 
six eggs, and just before you serve, turn them into a sauce- 
pan with the tomato, and stir one way for two minutes, allow- 
ing them time to be well done. 

Baked Eggs. — Mix finely chopped ham and bread-crumbs 
in about equal proportions, season with salt and pepper, and 
moisten with milk and a little melted butter ; half fill your 
small patty pans with the mixture, break an egg over the 
top of each, sprinkle with fine bread-crumbs, and bake; 
serve hot. 



£GGS. 12 ] 

Baked Eggs, No. 2. — Butter a clean, smooth saucepan, break 
as many eggs as will be needed into a saucer, one by one, 
and if found good, slip each into the saucepan. No broken 
yelk must be allowed, nor must they crowd so as to risk 
breaking the yelk after put in. Put a small piece of butter 
on each, and sprinkle with pepper and salt. Set into a well- 
heated oven, and bake till the whites are set. If the oven 
is rightly heated, it will take but a few minutes, and the 
cooking will be far more delicate than fried eggs. 

Eggs sur le Plat. — Melt butter on a stone-china or tin plate. 
Break the eggs carefully into this ; dust lightly with pepper 
and salt, and put on top of the stove until the whites are 
well set. Serve in the dish in which they are baked. 

Scrambled Eggs. — Put into a frying-pan enough butter to 
grease it well ; slip in the eggs carefully without breaking 
the yelks ; add butter, and season to taste ; when the whites 
begin to set, stir the eggs from the bottom of the pan, and 
continue stirring until the cooking is completed. The 
appearance at the end should be marbled, rather than mixed. 

Scrambled Eggs with Ham. — Put into a pan, butter, a little 
pepper and salt, and a little milk ; when hot, drop in the 
eggs, and with a knife cut the eggs and scrape them from 
the bottom as the whites begin to set ; add some cold ham 
chopped fine, and when done, serve in a hot dish. 

Toasted Eggs. — Cover the bottom of an earthenware or 
stone-china dish with rounds of delicately toasted bread, or 
with rounds of stale bread dipped in beaten egg and fried ' 
quickly to a golden-brown in butter or nice dripping. 
Break an egg carefully upon each, and set the dish imme- 
diately in front of a glowing fire. Toast over this as many 
slices of fat salt pork or ham as there are eggs in the dish, 
holding the meat so that it will fry veiy quickly and all the 
dripping fall upon the eggs. When these are well set, they 
a*e done. Turn the dish several times while toasting the 



122 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

meat, that the eggs may be equally cooked. Do not send 
the pork to table, but pepper the eggs lightly and remove 
with the toast to the dish in which they go to the table. 

Egg Toast. — Beat four eggs, yelks and whites, together 
thoroughly ; put two tablespoonfuls of butter into a sauce- 
pan and melt slowly ; then pour in the eggs and heat, with- 
out boiling, over a slow fire, stirring constantly ; add a litde 
salt, and when hot spread on slices of nicely browned toast 
and serve at once. 

Egg Baskets. — Boil quite hard as many eggs as will be 
needed. Put into cold water till cold, then cut neatly into 
halves with a thin, sharp knife ; remove the yelk and rub to 
a paste with some melted butter, adding pepper and salt. 
Cover up this paste and set aside till the filling is ready. 
Take cold roast duck, chicken, or turkey, which may be on 
hand, chop fine and pound smooth, and while pounding 
mix in the paste prepared from the yelks. As you pound, 
moisten with melted butter and some gravy which may 
have been left over from the fowls ; set this paste when done 
over hot water till well heated. Cut off a small slice from 
the end of the empty halves of the whites, so they will stand 
firm, then fill them with this paste ; place them close to- 
gether on a flat, round dish, and pour over the rest of the 
gravy, if any remains, or make a little fresh. A few spoon- 
fuls of cream or rich milk improves this dressing. 

Fricasseed Eggs. — Boil six eggs hard ; when cold, slice 
with a sharp knife. Have ready some slices of stale bread, 
fried to a nice brown in butter or drippings. Put a cupful 
of good broth in drawn butter over the fire, season it with 
pepper, salt, and a trace of onion ; let it come to a boil. 
Dip the slices of egg first into raw egg, then into cracker 
dust or bread-crumbs, and lay them gently into the gravy 
upon the side of the range. Do not let it actually boil, lest 
the eggs should break, but let them lie thus in the gravy at 



EGGS. 123 

least five minutes. Place the fried bread upon a platter, lay 
the sliced eggs evenly upon this, pour the gravy over all, 
and serve hot. 

Curried Eggs. — Boil six or eight fresh eggs quite hard, 
and put them aside until they are cold. Mix well together 
from two to three ounces of good butter, and from three to 
four dessertspoonfuls of currie-powder ; shake them in a 
stewpan, or thick saucepan, over a clear but moderate fire 
for some minutes, then throw in a couple of mild onions 
finely minced, and fry gently until they are soft ; pour in by 
degrees from half to three-quarters of a pint of broth or 
gravy, and stew slowly until they are reduced to pulp ; mix 
smoothly a small cup of thick cream with two teaspoonfuls 
of wheaten or rice flour ; stir them to the currie, and simmer 
the whole until the raw taste of the thickening is gone. 
Cut the eggs into half-inch slices, heat them through in the 
sauce without boiling them, and send to the table as hot as 
possible. 

Plain Omelet. — Beat thoroughly yelks of five eggs, and a 
dessertspoonful of flour, rubbed smooth in two-thirds of a 
cupful of milk. Salt and pepper to taste, and add a piece 
of butter the size of a hickory-nut. Beat the whites to a 
stiff froth, pour the mixture into the whites, and without 
stirring pour into a hot, buttered omelet pan. Cook on top 
of the range for five minutes ; then set pan and all into the 
oven to brown the top nicely. 

Baked Omelet. — Beat the yelks of six eggs, and add the 
whites of three eggs beaten very light ; salt and pepper to 
taste, and a tablespoonful of flour mixed in a cup of milk. 
Pour into a well-buttered pan and put into a hot oven ; 
when thick, pour over it the whites of three eggs beaten 
light ; then brown nicely, without allowing the top to be- 
come crusted. Serve immediately. 



124 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Omelet a la Mode. — Beat the yelks and whites of six eggS 
separately until light, then beat together and add one table- 
spoonful of cream. Have in the omelet pan a piece of 
butter ; when the butter is boiling hot, pour in the omelet 
and shake until it begins to stiffen, and then let it brown, and 
season to taste. Fold double and serve hot. 

If a larger omelet is desired, a tablespoonful of milk to 
each egg may be added, and one teaspoonful of corn-starch 
or flour to the whole. 

Cheese Omelet. — Butter the sides of a deep dish and cover 
with thin slices of rich cheese ; lay over the cheese thin 
slices of well-buttered bread, first covering the cheese with 
a little red pepper and mustard ; then another layer of cheese ; 
beat the yelk of an egg in a cup of cream or milk, and pour 
over the dish, and put at once into the oven ; bake till nicely 
browned. Serve hot, or it will be tough and hard, but when 
properly cooked it will be tender and savory. 

Meat or Pish Omelet. — Make the same as plain omelet. When 
it is done, scatter thickly over the surface cold, boiled ham, 
tongue, poultry, fish, or lobster, chopped fine, and season 
nicely to taste ; slip the broad knife under one side of the 
omelet and double, inclosing the meat. Then upset the 
frying-pan upon a hot dish, so transferring the omelet with- 
out breaking. Or the minced meat may be stirred in after 
the ingredients are put together, and before cooking. Be 
careful not to scorch the egg. 

Omelet with Oysters. — Allow one egg for each person, 
and beat yelks and whites separately, very light ; season 
to taste, and just before cooking add the oysters, which have 
been previously scalded in their own liquor. 

Egg Sandwiches. — Hard boil some fresh eggs, and, when 
cold, cut them into moderately thin slices, and lay them be- 
tween slices of bread and butter cut thin, and season well 



EGGS. 125 

with celery salt. For picnic parties or for traveling, these 
sandwiches are very nice. 

Deviled Eggs. — Boil the eggs hard, remove the shell, and 
cut in two as preferred. Remove the yelks, and add to them 
salt, cayenne pepper, melted butter, and mixed mustard to 
taste ; then stuff the cavities of the hard whites, and put the 
halves together again. Serve garnished with parsley. For 
picnics, etc., each egg can be wrapped in tissue paper to 
preserve its form. 

Pickled Eggs. — Boil the eggs until very hard ; when cold, 
shell them, and cut them in halves lengthways. Lay them 
carefully in large-mouthed jars, and pour over them scalding 
vinegar, well seasoned with whole pepper, allspice, a few 
pieces of ginger, and a few cloves of garlic. When cold, tie 
up closely, and let them stand a month. They are then fit. 
for use. With cold meat, they are a most delicious and 
delicate pickle. 

Egg Balls. — Rub the yelks of hard-boiled eggs with the 
raw yelk of an egg, well beaten, and season to taste. Roll 
this paste into balls the size of marbles, adding flour if neces- 
sary to thicken, and boil two minutes. A valuable embel- 
lishment and enrichment of soups. 

Soft-boiled Eggs. — Put the eggs in a warm saucepan and 
cover with boiling water. Let them stand where they 
will keep hot, but not boil, for ten minutes. This method 
will cook both whites and yolks. — New Cook Book: 
Miss Maria Parloa. Esles & Lauriat, Publishers. 

Sweet Omelet. — Beat four eggs without separating ; 
add a piece of butter the size of a walnut and four table- 
spoonfuls of warm water. Put another piece of butter 
in a frying-pan. When melted and hot turn in the egg 
and shake until set, then lift carefully the side, drain 
the liquid portion underneath, shake again until the 



126 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

omelet is cooked. Fill the centre with jam and fold 
over one side and then the other. Turn it into another 
heated pan ; turn on to a heated dish and serve. 

Creamed Eggs for Luncheon. — One-half dozen hard- 
boiled eggs cut in halves. Make a white sauce as fol- 
lows : Two teaspoonfuls butter, two level tablespoonfuls 
flour; melt butter and stir in flour; then add slowly 
one-half pint milk, seasoning with salt and pepper and 
a little celery. Pour over eggs and serve in a dish gar- 
nished with parsley. 

Eggs Scrambled in Tomatoes. — Fry one small slice of 
onion in three tablespoonfuls butter until crisp, then re- 
move onion ; add to the butter one large cup tomato, 
one teaspoonful sugar, one teaspoonful Worcestershire 
sauce. Season with salt and pepper and cook five min- 
utes. Add four eggs beaten and cook the same as 
scrambled eggs. Serve with entire wheat or brown 
bread toast. 

Omelet Souffle. — Separate six eggs, beat the whites to 
a very stiff froth ; beat and add the yolks of three, three 
tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar, the grated rind of 
half a lemon, a tablespoonful of lemon juice. Mix 
quickly and turn into a baking dish or form on a platter. 
Dust thickly with powdered sugar and bake in a quick 
oven about five minutes.

How t»o get your money back 

Occident Flour is the best flour made. 

There is no doubt about that. 

We know it is best because we make it from North Dakota wheat that is 
proven by analysis to contain the largest amount of gluten and phosphates, those 
basic elements that assure strength, purity and color. 

Our mills, our millers, and our machinery are the best that money can buy. 
And being located in the heart of the famous hard wheat belt, we can secure the 
very cream of the wheat, before it is shipped to the large cities and mixed with 
cheaper wheat from other parts of the country. 

Because of the extra high-grade wheat used — and because a larger propor- 
tion of the lower-grade flour is taken out. of it. in it»s manufacture — Occi- 
dent. Flour costs a little bit more than other standard brands of flour. About 50 
cents a barrel more. 

Remember — No matter what price you pay for flour, bread is the cheapest 
food product going on to your table. 

Therefore — Occident Flour is the cheapest flour you can buy because extra 
quality means extra consumption of bread and smaller consumption of more expen- 
sive foods. 

How t»o get your money back — When you buy flour, always buy Occident 
Flour. The grocer from whom you buy it is authorized to refund your money if 
the flour is not found exactly as represented — t»he best. Flour on earth.

X.— BREAD, BISCUIT, HOT CAKES, ETC. 

AN immense department is opened up by the title of this 
chapter ; and it is a department of immense im- 
portance. Bread is confessedly the " staff of life," 
and, therefore, it should be good. And whatever takes the 
place of bread, be it biscuits, hot cakes, muffins, or what 
not, should also be good, or nothing is gained by the 
exchange. Many a housekeeper can make excellent pies, 
cakes, etc., but when bread is needed, she flies to the bakery, 
confessing her total inability to prepare this indispensable 
commodity. 

But even bread may become distasteful as a steady diet. 
To vary it with the long line of splendid substitutes which 
are possible, and which are discussed in this chapter, is a 
most desirable ability. This department, therefore, is worthy 
of every housewife's devout study. 



I.— BREAD. 



ESSENTIALS TO MAKING GOOD BREAD ; HOW TO KNOW GOOD FLOUR J 
YEAST j RAISING BREAD ; BAKING BREAD. TWELVE RECIPES FOR 
BREAD. 

THREE things are essential to the making of good bread, 
namely, good flour, good yeast, and, judicious baking. 
A fourth might be added, experience, without which 
none of the domestic arts can be successfully carried on. 

RECIPES. 

Wheat Bread. — Put seven pounds of flour into a breadpan ; 
hollow out the centre, and add a quart of lukewarm water, 
a teaspoonful of salt, and a wineglassful of yeast. Have 



128 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

ready more warm water, and add gradually as much as will 
make a smooth, soft dough. Knead it well, dust a little 
flour over it, cover it with a cloth, and set it in a warm place 
four hours ; then knead it again for fifteen minutes and let 
it rise again. Divide it into loaves, and prick them with a 
fork, and bake in a quick oven from forty minutes to an 
hour. 

Potato Bread. — Three and one-half quarts of sifted flour, 
three boiled potatoes, one quart warm water, one teacupful 
of yeast, one even tablespoonful salt. Mix at night ; put 
the flour in a large bowl ; hollow a place in the centre for 
the mashed potatoes, water, and salt. Stir in flour enough 
to make a smooth batter ; add yeast ; stir in the rest of the 
flour. Put the dough on the floured board ; knead fifteen 
minutes, using barely enough flour to prevent sticking. 
Flour the bowl, lay the dough in it, cover and leave it to 
rise. In the morning, divide in four parts ; mold into loaves; 
when light, prick, and bake in a moderate oven. 

Salt Rising Bread. — Pour a pint of hot water in a two-quart 
pail or pitcher on one-half tablespoonful of salt ; when it 
has cooled a little, add one and one-third pints of flour ; 
mix well, and leave the pitcher in a kettle of water, as warm 
as that used for mixing. Keep it at the same temperature 
until the batter is nearly twice its original bulk, which will 
be in from five to eight hours. It may be stirred once or 
twice during the rising. Add to this a sponge made of one 
quart of hot water, two and one-half quarts of flour — adding 
as much more as may be necessary to make a soft dough ; 
mix well, and leave in a warm place to rise. When light, 
mold into loaves, keeping them as soft as possible ; lay in 
buttered tins. When light again, prick and bake. 

Milk Bread. — Let two quarts of milk come to a boil ; stand 
it aside to cool, and when it becomes tepid, add flour to it 
gradually until it makes a batter just soft enough to beat up 



BREAD, BISCUIT, HOT CAKES, ETC. J29 

with a spoon. To this add one cake of compressed yeast 
thoroughly dissolved in lukewarm water. The batter should . 
then be well beaten. Cover with a towel and set in a warm 
place to rise. When light, add two tablespoonfuls of salt, 
one of lard, one of light brown sugar, and flour enough to 
make a soft dough. Knead steadily for about half an hour. 
This quantity should make four or five medium-sized loaves. 
Put them in greased pans and let them rise again. When 
light, prick with a fork and bake in a quick oven. 

Vienna Bread. — The Vienna bread that became so famous 
on the Centennial Exhibition grounds in 1 876 was made on 
the following recipe : Sift in a tin pan four pounds of flour ; 
bank up against the sides ; pour in one quart of milk and 
water, and mix into it enough flour to form a thin batter, 
and then quickly and lightly add one pint of milk, in which 
is dissolved one ounce of salt and one and three-quarter 
ounces of yeast ; leave the remainder of the flour against 
the sides of the pan; cover the pan with a cloth, and set in 
a place free from draught for three quarters of an hour ; 
then mix in the rest of the flour until the dough will leave 
the bottom and sides of the pan, and let it stand two and a 
half hours ; finally, divide the mass into one-pound pieces, 
to be cut in turn into twelve parts each ; this gives square 
pieces about three and a half inches thick, each corner of 
which is taken up and folded over to the centre, and then 
the cases are turned over on a dough-board to rise for half 
an hour, when they are put in a hot oven that will bake 
them in ten minutes. 

Rye Bread. — Scald two handfuls of corn-meal with a quart 
of boiling water, and add a quart of milk and a tablespoonful 
of salt. When cool, add a teacupful of yeast, and enough 
rye flour to make it as stiff as wheat-bread dough. After 
it has risen put it in pans and bake an hour and a half. 

Brown Bread. — Take one cup of bread-crumbs, one pint of 



130 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

sweet milk, one cup of molasses, butter the size of an egg, 
one teaspoonful of soda, corn-meal enough to make a stiff 
batter, with salt to taste. Turn the whole into a buttered 
basin and steam for two hours ; then bake in a quick oven 
half an hour. 

Boston Brown Bread. — Take three and three-fourth cupfuls 
of Indian corn-meal, two and one-half cupfuls rye-meal, two- 
thirds cupful molasses, one quart milk, either sweet or sour; 
two even teaspoonfuls soda, dissolved in the milk ; steam in 
a tin pudding boiler five hours ; take off the cover and set 
in the oven to brown. 

Corn Bread. — Two heaping cupfuls Indian meal, one cup- 
ful wheat flour, two heaping teaspoonfuls Plume Baking 
Powder; mix well together while dry; one teaspoonful salt, 
two tablespoonfuls white sugar, two eggs, one tablespoonful 
lard, two and a half cupfuls cold milk ; beat the eggs, melt the 
lard, and dissolve the salt and sugar in the milk before add- 
ing them to the flour ; bake in buttered pans in a quick oven. 

Graham Bread.-^Three quarts of Graham flour ; one quart 
of warm water; one gill of yeast; one gill of sirup; 
one tablespoonful of salt; one even teaspoonful of soda. 
Mix thoroughly and put in well-buttered pans to rise. Bake 
about an hour and a half. 

This same mixture may be thinned and baked in gem 
pans for Graham gems. 

Bice Bread. — After a pint of rice has been boiled soft, mix > 
it with two quarts of rice flour or wheat flour. When cold, 
add half a teaspoonful of yeast, a teaspoonful of salt, and 
enough milk to make a soft dough. When it has risen, 
bake in small buttered pans. 

Unleavened Bread. — Mix wheat flour into a stiff dough 
with warm water or milk ; add a little lard, or suet, and bake 
in thin cakes. Bake as soon as mixed, and eat hot

II.— TOAST. 

WHAT TOAST IS GOOD FOR. SIX METHODS OF PREPARING TOAST. 

AS a palatable method of disposing of stale bread, as well 
as to furnish a variety of agreeable dishes, toast is an 
important factor in the culinary economy of the home. 
As a dish for invalids it is indispensible. 

RECIPES. 

Dry Toast is produced by browning stale baker's bread 
over glowing coals. A toasting fork, or rack, of which 
there are various patterns, is a great convenience. Do not 
burn the toast, nor allow it to be so browned as to harden it. 
It should be eaten hot, as it becomes tough when allowed 
to cool. 

Buttered Toast. — For buttered toast, the slices should be 
thicker than for dry toast. Butter the slices as toasted, and 
keep warm until served. Excessive buttering should be 
avoided. 

Egg Toast. — On slices of buttered toast lay poached eggs. 
Serve with Worcestershire sauce for breakfast. 

French Toast. — Beat three eggs light, add one cupful of 
milk, with pepper and salt to taste. Dip into this slices of 
bread, then fry them in hot butter to a delicate brown. 

Milk Toast. — Toast the bread an even, delicate brown, and 
pile into a hot dish. Boil milk with a little salt, a teaspoon- 
ful of flour, and one of butter, rubbed together; pour it over 
the toast and serve hot. 

Cream Toast. — Take slices of baker's bread from which 
the crust has been pared and toast it to a golden brown. 
Have on the range a shallow bowl or pudding-dish, more 
than half full of boiling water, in which a tablespoonful of 
butter has been melted. As each slice is toasted, dip in this 



132 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

for a second, sprinkle lightly with salt, and lay ih the deep 
heated dish in which it is to be served. Have ready, by the 
time all the bread is toasted, a quart of milk scalding hot, 
but not boiling. Thicken this with two tablespoonfuls of 
corn-starch or best flour ; let it simmer until cooked ; put 
in two tablespoonfuls of butter, and when this is melted, the 
beaten whites of three eggs. Boil up once, and pour over 
the toast, lifting the lower slices one by one, that the creamy 
mixture may run in between them. Cover closely, and 
sefcin the oven two or three minutes before serving. 



III.— FANCY BREADS. 

FANCY BREADS AND PLAIN CAKES \ THEIR GENERAL USEFULNESS. 
EIGHT RECIPES FOR FANCY BREADS. 

SOME special preparations come naturally between bread 
and cake. For convenient classification, they are 
grouped here under the title of Fancy Breads, though 
they might as well be classed as Plain Cakes. They serve 
a good purpose for variety, for luncheon, etc. See plainer 
forms of cakes. 

RECIPES. 

Sally Lunn. — One quart of flour, a piece of butter the size 
of an egg, three tablespoonfuls of sugar, two eggs, two tea- 
cupfuls of milk, two teaspoonfuls of cream tartar, one of 
soda, and a little salt. Scatter the cream of tartar, the sugar, 
and the salt into the flour ; add the eggs, the butter (melted), 
and one cup of milk ; dissolve the soda in the remaining cup, 
and stir all together steadily a few moments. Bake in two 
round pans. 

Sally Ltuiil No. 2. — Rub into a quart of flour two teaspoon- 
fuls of baking-powder ; beat together nearly half a cup of 



BREAD, BISCUIT, HOT CAKES, ETC. 133 

butter and two tablespoonfuls of sugar ; put into the flour 
and mix with a pint of milk ; then add two eggs, beaten 
light. Mix and bake as above. 

Johnny Cake. — One quart of buttermilk or sour milk, one 
quart Indian meal, one quart of flour, one cup of molasses, 
a teaspoonful of soda, two scant teaspoonfuls if the milk is 
sour, a teaspoonful of salt. Bake in shallow pans in a quick 
oven. 

Hoe Cake. — Scald one quart of Indian-meal in enough water 
to make a thick batter ; add a teaspoonful of salt, one of 
molasses, and two of butter. Bake on a board before a hot 
fire or in a pan. 

Scotch, Shorttake. — Two pounds of fine flour, one pound 
of fresh, sweet butter, half a pound of finest sifted sugar; 
throughly knead together without water; roll out to 
half an inch in thickness, and place it on paper in a shallow 
pan ; bake very slowly until of proper crispness. The cake, 
to be good, must be very brittle. 

Pumpkin Bread. — Stew and strain a sufficient quantity of 
pumpkin ; add enough Indian-meal to stiffen it, with yeast 
and a little salt; when sufficiently raised, bake as in ordi- 
nary bread. 

Pone. — This is a dish prepared by the Indians, called also 
paune. Take two cupfuls of corn-meal, two of wheat flour, 
one of sugar, and half a cup of melted butter. Add one 
egg, one teaspoonful of salt, one of soda, and two of cream 
of tartar. Mix with enough milk to make a moderately 
stiff batter, and bake in a hot oven. 

Barley Bread. — In Scotland, Norway, and other climates 
where wheat is not grown, barley bread is used extensively. 
It is both wholesome and palatable. Mix the barley meal 
with warm water and a little salt, but no yeast. Mix to a 
stiff dough, roll into flat cakes, and bake before the fire or 
in an oven. Eat hot, with butter.

IV.— ROLLS. 

A FAVORITE BREAKFAST DISH. SEVEN VARIETIES OF ROLLS. 

A FAVORITE departure from the ordinary forms of 
bread is furnished in rolls. They are exceedingly pop- 
ular for breakfast, served warm. There are sufficient 
variations in rolls to make them suitable for use day after 
day, if this be desired. 

RECIPES. 

Plain Rolls. — Boil six potatoes in two quarts of water, and 
when done pour and press the whole through the colander ; 
when cool, but not cold, add flour to make a thick batter ; 
add half a cup of yeast, or one-half cake of compressed yeast, 
and set to rise ; when light, add half a cup of lard and but- 
ter mixed, a tablespoonful of sugar, teaspoonful of salt, and 
flour to make a soft dough ; knead well and set again to 
rise ; when light, knead down again ; repeat three or four 
times ; an hour before they are to be used cut in small 
pieces, roll out, spread with melted butter, and fold over, 
laying them in a pan so that they will not touch each other ; 
set them in a warm place, and when light bake quickly. Or, 
make into an oblong roll without spreading and rolling, and 
just before putting them into the oven, gash deeply across 
the top with a sharp knife. 

English Rolls. — Two pounds of flour, two ounces of butter, 
three tablespoonful s of yeast, one pint of warm milk ; mix 
well together, and set in a warm place to rise ; knead, and 
make into rolls ; let them rise again and bake twenty min- 
utes. 

Breakfast Rolls. — One quart of sifted flour, three teaspoon- 
fuls baking-powder, half toaspoonful salt; mix well together 
dry, then add three and half gills of cold milk, or enough 
to make it the consistency of batter, and drop with a spoon 



BREAD, BISCUIT, HOT CAKES, ETC. 135 

into gem baking-pans, which should have been previously 
heated very hot and buttered. 

French Rolls. — One pint of milk, scalded ; put into it while 
hot half a cupful of sugar, and one tablespoonful of butter ; 
when the milk is cool, add a little salt and half a cupful of 
yeast, or one cake of compressed yeast ; stir in flour enough 
to make a stiff sponge, and when light mix as for bread. 
Let it rise until light, punch it down with the hand, and let 
it rise again, and repeat this process two or three times ; 
then turn the dough on to the molding board, and pound 
with rolling-pin until thin enough to cut. Cut out with a 
tumbler, brush the surface of each one with melted butter, 
and fold over. Let the rolls rise on the tins ; bake, and 
while warm brush over the surface with melted butter to 
make the crust tender. 

Vienna Rolls. — One quart sifted flour, two heaping tea- 
spoonfuls Plume Baking Powder; mix well while dry ; then 
add a tablespoonful of butter or* lard, made a little soft by 
warming and stirring, and about three-fourths of a pint, or 
enough cold, sweet milk for a dough of usual stiffness, with 
about half a teaspoonful of salt dissolved in it. Mix into a 
dough easily to be handled without sticking ; turn on the 
board and roll out to the thickness of half an inch, cut it 
out with a large cake-cutter, spread very lightly with butter, 
fold one-half over the other, and lay them in a greased pan 
without touching. Wash them over with a little milk, and 
bake in a hot oven. 

Parker House Rolls. — One teacupful of yeast, or one cake 
of compressed yeast, a little salt, one tablespoonful sugar, 
piece of lard size of an egg, one pint milk, flour sufficient to 
mix. Put the milk on the stove to scald with the lard in it. 
Prepare the flour with salt, sugar, and yeast. Then add the 
milk, not too hot. Knead thoroughly, and when mixed set 
to rise ; when light, knead again slightly. Then roll out 



1 36 THE HO USE WIFE S LIB HAS Y. 

and cut with large biscuit-cutter. Spread a little butter on 
each roll and lap together. Let them rise again very light, 
and bake in a quick oven. 

Geneva Rolls. — Into two pounds of flour break three 
ounces of butter, add a little salt, and make into a sponge 
with yeast, previously mixed with milk and water. Allow 
the batter to rise ; then mix in two eggs, made lukewarm 
by the adding of hot milk, and work the sponge to a light 
dough. Let it stand for three-quarters of an hour longer ; 
mold into small rolls ; place them in buttered pans. When 
light, brush them with beaten yelks of eggs, and bake for 
twenty minutes or half an hour. Serve hot.

DER BISCUITS, SODA BISCUITS, ETC. \ CARE OF PANS. FIFTEEN 
RECIPES FOR BISCUITS, BUNS, ETC. 

GREAT care is requisite in making biscuits that quantities 
be accurately observed and that the ingredients used 
are of proper quality. Flour should be a few months 
old. New flour will not make good biscuits. It should 
always be sifted. 

The oven, too, needs careful attention. On its condition 
the success of biscuit baking will depend. Rolls and bis- 
cuit should bake quickly. To make them a nice color, rub 
them over with warm water just before putting them into 
the oven ; to glaze them, brush lightly with milk and sugar 
Baking-powder biscuit and soda biscuit should be made 
as rapidly as possible, laid into hot pans, and put in a 
quick oven. Gem pans should always be heated and well 
greased. 



BREAD, BISCUIT, HOT CAKES, ETC. 237 

RECIPES. 

Potato Biscuit. — Pare ten potatoes, boil them thoroughly, 
and mash fine ; add two cups of lukewarm milk, two table- 
spoonfuls of white sugar, half a cup of yeast, and flour 
enough to make a thin batter. Mix well and allow it to 
rise. Then add four tablespoonfuls of melted butter, a little 
salt, and enough flour to make a soft dough. Let this rise 
again ; roll into a sheet about an inch thick, and cut into 
cakes. Set to rise again, and bake in a quick oven. 

Light Biscuit. — When kneading bread, set aside a small 
loaf for biscuits. Into this, work a heaping tablespoonful of 
lard and butter mixed and a teaspoonful of sugar. The 
more it is worked the whiter it will be. As it rises, 
mold it down twice before making into biscuit. Roll out 
and cut with a biscuit-cutter. The dough should be quite 
soft. 

Soda Biscuits. — One quart of flour, a tablespoonful of but- 
ter and two of lard, a teaspoonful of salt, and one teaspoon 
even full of cream of tartar, one teaspoonful of soda ; sift 
the cream tartar with the flour dry ; rub the butter and lard 
very thoroughly through it ; dissolve the soda in a pint of 
milk and mix all together. Roll out, adding as little flour 
as possible; cut with a biscuit-cutter, and bake twenty 
minutes in a quick oven. 

Tea Biscuit. — Take one quart sifted flour, one tablespoon- 
ful shortening, half teaspoonful salt, and two teaspoonfuls 
Plume baking-powder ; mix well together dry, then add 
sufficient cold milk or water to form a very soft dough ; 
bake immediately in a quick oven. 

Cream Biscuits. — Dissolve one teaspoonful of soda in a 
quart of sour cream, add to it flour sufficient to make a soft 
dough and a little salt ; or use sour milk, and rub a table- 
spoonful of butter into the flour.

Let them rise, and bake in a moderate oven. Glaze while 
hot with white of egg, in which has been stirred, not beaten, 
a little powdered sugar, or sift the powdered sugar in while 
the egg is still moist on the top. Rusks should never be 
eaten hot. 

Sweet Rusk. — One pint of warm milk — new is best — one- 
half cup of butter, one cup of sugar, two eggs, one tea- 
spoonful of salt, two tablespoonfuls of yeast ; make a sponge 
with the milk, yeast, and enough flour to make a thin bat- 
ter, and let it rise over night. In the morning add the

a light brown, and brush over with a feather or soft bit of 
rag, dipped in the white of an egg beaten up stiff with white 
sugar. 



140 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Pop Overs. — Mix four cupfuls of flour, four cupfuls of 
milk, four eggs, and a little salt. This quantity will make 
about twenty puffs in gem-pans, which must be baked quick 
and done to a nice brown. 



VI.— MUFFINS AND WAFFLES. 

HOW MUFFINS AND WAFFLES DIFFER \ THEIR RELATION TO OTHER 
KINDRED PREPARATIONS ; MUFFIN-RINGS AND WAFFLE-IRONS ; 
WHEN TO USE MUFFINS AND WAFFLES J HOW TO SERVE THEM. 
ELEVEN RECIPES FOR MUFFINS AND WAFFLES. 

MUFFINS are baked in rings on a griddle, or in gem- 
pans, over a quick fire. Waffles are baked in waffle- 
irons, which inclose the batter and imprint both sides 
of the cake as it rises in the process of baking. Both muf- 
fins and waffles form a medium between bread and biscuits 
on the one side and griddle-cakes on the other. Muffin- 
rings were formerly about four inches in diameter, but now, 
with better taste, they are used much smaller. The approved 
waffle-irons of to-day are circular, baking four waffles at 
once, and suspended on a pivot that permits them to be 
turned with a touch of the fork. Both muffins and waffles 
are suitable for tea, and with stewed chicken and such deli- 
cacies they are really delicious. They should always be 
served hot and with the best of butter. Waffles and catfish 
are a famous dish at some eating-houses. 

RECIPES. 

MufflllS. — Two eggs lightly beaten, one quart of flour, one 
teaspoonful of salt, three teaspoonfuls of Plume baking- 
powder, one tablespoonful of melted butter, one pint of 
milk, and two teaspoonfuls of vanilla extract, if liked. 
Beat up quickly to the consistency of a cake batter; bake in 
buttered gem-pans in a hot oven. 



BREAD, BISCUIT, HOT CAKES, ETC. \\\ 

Muffins, No. 2. — One cup of home-made yeast or half of a 
compressed yeast cake, one pint of sweet milk, two eggs, 
two tablespoonfuls of melted butter, two tablespoonfuls of 
sugar. Beat the butter, sugar, and eggs well together ; then 
stir in the milk, slightly warmed, and thicken with flour to 
the consistency of griddle-cakes. When light, bake in muffin- 
rings or on a griddle. If wanted for tea, the batter should 
be mixed immediately after breakfast. Muffins should never 
be cut with a knife, but be pulled open with the fingers. 

Rice Muffins. — Take one quart of sour milk, three well- 
beaten eggs, a little salt, a teaspoonful of soda, and enough 
of rice flour to thicken to a stiff batter. Bake in rings. 

Hominy Muffins. — Substitute hominy, well cooked and 
mashed, for the rice, and proceed as above. 

Bread Muffins. — Cut the crust off four thick slices of bread ; 
put them in a pan and pour on them just enough boiling 
water to soak them thoroughly. Let them stand an hour, 
covered ; then drain off the water and stir the "bread to a 
smooth paste. Stir in two tablespoonfuls of flour, a half 
pint of milk, and three well-beaten eggs. Bake to a delicate 
brown in well-buttered muffin-rings. 

Graham Muffins. — One quart of Graham flour, two tea- 
spoonfuls of baking-powder, a piece of butter the size of a 
walnut, one egg, one tablespoonful of sugar, one-half tea- 
spoonful of salt, milk enough to make a batter as thick as 
for griddle-cakes. Bake in gem-pans or muffin-rings in a 
hot oven. 

Corn Muffins. — Mix two cupfuls of corn-meal, two cupfuls 
of flour, one cupful of sugar, half a cupful of melted butter, 
two eggs, and one teaspoonful of salt. Dissolve one tea- 
spoonful of soda and two of cream tartar in a little milk, and 
beat it through. Add milk enough to make a moderately 
stiff batter, and bake in rings or gem-pans. 



142 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Crumpets. — Three cupfuls of warm milk, half a cupful of 
yeast, two tablespoonfuls of melted butter, one saltspoonful 
each of salt and soda dissolved in hot water, flour enough 
to make a good batter. Set these ingredients — leaving out 
the butter and soda — as a sponge. When very light, beat 
in the melted butter, with a very little flour ; stir in the soda 
hard, fill patty-pans or muffin-rings with the mixture, and 
let them stand fifteen minutes before baking. 

Raised Waffles. — One quart of warm milk, one tablespoon- 
ful of butter, three eggs, one gill of yeast, one tablespoon- 
ful of salt, and flour to make a stiff batter. Set to rise, and 
bake in waffle-irons, which must be well heated before used. 

Quick Waffles. — One quart flour, two teaspoonfuls Plume 

Baking Powder,one teaspoonful salt ; mix dry ; then stir in 

one tablespoonful melted butter, two well-beaten eggs, and 

enough cold, sweet milk for a batter thin enough to pour ; 

bake at once in waffle-irons- 

Bice Waffles. — Mix a teacupful and a half of boiling rice 
with a pint of milk, rubbing it smooth over the fire. Take 
from the fire and add a pint of cold milk and a teaspoonful 
of salt. Stir in four well-beaten eggs with enough flour to 
make a thin batter, and bake as above. Waffles should 
always be served hot. Powdered sugar with a flavor of 
powdered cinnamon makes a pleasing dressing for them.

CAKES made of a batter so thin that it flows easily upon

and be served hot, are griddle-cakes, and great favorites 
they are. 



BREAD, BISCUIT, HOT CAKES, ETC. 143 

All new griddles are hard to manage, but as the only way 
to get old ones is to make them out of new ones, we are 
shut up to the necessity of using the new, though they do 
not work so well. Opinions divide between iron griddles 
and those of soapstone. The latter require no greasing. 
Hence trouble is saved, and the smoke of the fat used in 
the constant greasing of a hot iron griddle is entirely 
avoided. But still, many housekeepers prefer the old style. 

A hot griddle is essential to good griddle-cakes. But it 
must not be hot enough to burn before it bakes. A cold 
griddle will make cakes tough, unpalatable, and decidedly 
unwholesome. 

Hot cakes may well be served with powdered sugar, 
Golden Tree Brand Maple Syrup or any molasses in 
the market. Cold days are the gala days for hot cakes. 
Time immemorial, buckwheat cakes and sausage have gone 
to the table side by side. There is delightful harmony in 
this union ; but to serve hot cakes and fish together would 
introduce discord into the best regulated family. There is 
an eminent fitness between hot cakes and certain other 
dishes, and it must never be disregarded. 

RECIPES. 

Buckwheat Cakes. — One quart of buckwheat-meal, one 
pint of wheat-flour or Indian-meal, half a teacupful of yeast, 
.salt to taste ; mix the flour, buckwheat, and salt with as 
much water moderately warm as will make it into a thin 
batter ; beat it well, then add the yeast ; when well mixed, 
set it in a warm place to rise ; as soon as it is very light, 
grease the griddle and bake the cakes to a delicate brown. 
Butter them with' good butter and serve hot. 

Graham Griddle-cakes. — Scald a cupful of Indian-meal in a 
pint of boiling water, and strain it over night. Thin it with 
a quart of milk, and make into a sponge with a cupful of 



144 THE HOUSE WIFE'S LIBRAS Y. 

Graham flour, a large tablespoonful of molasses, and half a 
cupful of yeast In the morning, add salt to taste, a cupful 
of white flour, half a teaspoonful of soda, dissolved in hot 
water, and a tablespoonful of butter or lard. Stir in enough 
water to make batter of the right consistency, and bake on 
a hot griddle. 

Flannel Cakes. — Three eggs, one quart of sweet milk, about 
one quart of flour, a small teaspoonful of salt, two table- 
spoonfuls of prepared baking-powder ; beat the yelks, and 
half of the milk, salt, and flour together ; then the remainder 
of the milk ; and last, the whites of the eggs well beaten. 
Bake in small cakes on a hot griddle. 

Flannel Cakes, No. 2. — One quart of milk, three eggs, one 
cupful of yeast, one dessertspoonful of salt, flour enough for 
a thinnish batter, and a teaspoonful of butter ; set to rise ; 
bake like buckwheat cakes. Cakes half Indian and half 
wheat are very nice, and good cakes may be made even 
without the eggs. 

Eice Cakes. — Soak a cupful of rice five or six hours in 
enough warm water to cover it. Then boil slowly till soft. 
While still warm, but not hot, stir in a tablespoonful of but- 
ter, a tablespoonful of sugar, a teaspoonful of salt, and a 
quart of milk. When cold, add three eggs, beaten very 
light. Sift a half teaspoonful of cream of tartar into a 
quarter cupful of rice flour, and add them to the batter, first 
beating into it a quarter teaspoonful of soda dissolved in hot 
water. 

Rice Cakes, No. 2. — Boil a cupful of rice until quite soft, 
setting it aside until cool. Beat three eggs very light, and 
put them into the rice, with a pint of flour, into which you 
have sifted three teaspoonfuls of prepared baking-powder. 
Add a teaspoonful of butter and one of salt, making it into 
a batter with a quart of milk. Bake on a griddle. 



BREAD, BISCUIT, HOT CAKES, ETC. 145 

Hominy Cakes. — Mix with cold boiled hominy an equal 
quantity of white flour until perfectly smooth ; add a tea- 
spoonful of salt and thin off with buttermilk, in part of 
which a teaspoonful of soda has been dissolved ; when of 
the proper consistency for griddle cakes, add a dessertspoon- 
ful of melted butter, and bake as usual. 

Sour Milk Cakes. — One pint sour milk, one teaspoonful of. 
soda, a little salt, two eggs, and flour to make a thin batter ; 
bake on a hot griddle. 

Indian Griddle Cakes. — One large cupful Indian-meal, four 
tablespoonfuls of wheat flour, two tablespoonfuls of Plume 
baking-powder, one teaspoonful salt, mix together dry, then 
add sufficient cold water for a batter ; bake at once on a hot 
griddle. 

Slapjacks. — One pint of milk, three eggs, one teaspoonful 
of soda, and one of salt, flour enough to make a thin bat- 
ter. Butter your griddle, and fry them the size of a tea- 
plate ; when one is done, turn it on the dish, sprinkle with a 
little white sugar, and continue in this way till they are all 
fried. Always fry them with butter. A little nutmeg may 
be grated with the sugar on each cake. 



VIII.— YEAST AND YEAST CAKES. 

NATURE OF YEAST J ACTION OF YEAST IN DOUGH ; CAUSES OF LIGHT 
BREAD AND HEAVY BREAD J CARE OF YEAST. TWO RECIPES FOR 
YEAST AND YEAST CAKES. 

IN this chapter, yeast has been so often referred to that its 
special consideration seems important just here. An- 
alytically considered, it consists of an innumerable 
quantity of infinitesimal fungi, called the yeast-plant. The 
remarkable characteristic of these minute^ plants is, that 
under fayoring conditions they multiply to an incredible 
10

extent in a very short time. Thus the production of yeast, 
in proper mixtures, is an easy matter. 

When yeast is placed in dough, it immediately produces 
fermentation, in the process of which gases are generated, 
which permeate the dough, filling it with gas-vessels and so 
producing the spongy appearance so familiar in raised 
bread. If this process goes too far, it sours the dough and 
unfits it for food. If arrested by placing the dough in a 
hot oven, the gases will be driven off by the heat, and the 
thin dough walls will be set and baked. If the oven be 
slow, the gases will be driven off, the dough walls will col- 
lapse, and heavy bread will be the result. The proper use 
of yeast is most important, therefore. It must be watched 
as carefully as any other tender plant. Excessive heat or 
cold, or rough mechanical usage will quickly destroy it. 

RECIPES. 

Patent Yeast. — Boil two ounces of hops in four quarts of 
water for a half hour. Strain and cool till lukewarm, then 
add a handful of salt, a half pound of sugar, and a pound 
of flour, all mixed well and beaten up together. After it 
has stood forty-eight hours, add three pounds of potatoes, 
boiled and well-mashed. Let it stand twenty-four hours, 
stirring it often ; then strain and bottle. It is ready for, im- 
mediate use, or will keep several months. Keep in a cool 
place. 

Yeast Cakes. — Thicken good yeast with Indian-meal till it 
becomes a stiff batter. A little lye will make it adhere bet- 
ter. Make into cakes an inch thick and two by three inches 
in area. Dry them in the air, but not in the sun. Keep 
them in a bag in a cool, dry place. One of these cakes is 
enough for four quarts of flour. To use them, soak in 
milk or water several hours and use as other yeast.

CAKE IN INGREDIENTS AND MANIPULATION ESSENTIAL J KEEP IIT- 
GREDIENTS COOL ; MIX QUICKLY ; HOW TO SHORTEN ; HOW ao 
ROLL; THE FILLING; THE BAKING. EIGHTY-SEVEN RECIPES 
FOR PASTRY AND PUDDINGS. 

THAT pastry may be wholesome and appetizing, great 
care in the selection of ingredients and in their ma- 
nipulation is absolutely essential. One fact must 
always be borne in mind — that inferior ingredients cannot be 
made into superior compounds — though the finest ingre- 
dients may be ruined by careless or unskillful handling. 
Some suggestions of general application are therefore de- 
sirable. 

Be careful to have all the materials cool, and the butter and 
lard hard ; use cold water (ice-water if convenient) ; use a 
cool knife, and work on a marble slab if it can be had. 

Put the ingredients together quickly, handling as little as 
possible ; slow mixing and much contact with the hands 
or fingers make tough crust. Always use well-sifted flour. 

Except in puff-paste, lard and butter in about equal pro- 
portions make the best crust ; if made of butter alone, it is 
almost sure to be tough. That of lard alone, though ten- 
der, is usually white, and insipid. Beef drippings, or the 
drippings of fresh pork, make a very light and palatable 
crust, lighter and more tender indeed than that made with 
butter alone, much better tasted than that made with lard 
alone, and quite equal to that made with butter and lard 
combined. Never use mutton drippings in crust 

Use very little salt and very little water; pour the latter 
in gradually, only a few drops at a time, unless you want 
tough crust 



148 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Use plenty of flour on your paste-board, to keep the paste 
from sticking. Work the crust of one pie at a time, and 
always roll from you — one way only. 

The filling for thepie should be perfectly cool when put 
in, or it will make the bottom crust heavy. 

In making juicy pies, cut a slit in the top to let the steam 
escape, else the pie will be puffed unduly. 

The oven should be hot, but not sufficiently so to scorch 
or to set the paste before it has had time to rise ; if too 
slack, the paste will not rise at all, but will be white and 
clammy. The best paste has a tinge of yellow. If per- 
mitted to scorch or brown, even the best paste becomes 
rancid. 

RECIPES. 

Pie Crust. — Take one-half cupful of lard, one-half cupful 
of butter, one quart of sifted flour, one cupful of cold water 
and a little salt. Rub the butter and lard slightly into the 
flour ; wet it with the water, mixing it as little as possible. 
This quantity will make two large or three small pies. 

Pie Crust Glaze. — To prevent juice from soaking the under 
crust, beat up the white of an egg, and before filling the pie, 
brush over the crust with the beaten egg. Brush over the 
top crust also, to give it a beautiful yellow brown. 

Puff Paste. — Take one pound of sifted flour, on which 
sprinkle a very little sugar ; take the yelks of one or two 
eggs, and beat into them a little ice-water, and pour gently 
into the centre of the flour, and work into a firm paste, 
adding water as is necessary; divide three-quarters of a 
pound or a pound of firm, solid butter, as you prefer, into 
three parts ; roll out the paste, and spread one part of the 
butter on half of the paste ; fold the other half over, and 
roll out again, repeating the process until the butter is all 
rolled in ; then set the paste on the ice for fifteen or twenty 



PASTRY AND PUDDINGS. 149 

minutes, after which roll out again three times, each time 
rolling it the opposite direction ; then put on the ice again 
until cold, when it is ready for use. Such paste will keep 
several days in a refrigerator, but should not be allowed to 
freeze. 

Paste Shells. — Take sufficient rich puff-paste prepared as 
in the preceding recipe, roll /ery thin, cut to shape, and bake 
in a brisk oven in tin pans. Baked carefully, before fill- 
ing with fru»t, the paste rises better. When cool, the shells 
may be filled with stewed fruit, jelly, preserves, rich cream 
whipped to a stiff froth, raspberries, strawberries, or sliced 
peaches. These are delicious light desserts. Raspberries, 
strawberries, or sliced peaches, smothered with whipped 
cream on these shells, are really exquisite. 

Apple Pie. — Line a pie plate with paste, and fill it heaping 
full with tart apples, sliced very thin. Sweeten and spice to 
taste, mixing well into the apples. Put in plenty of butter, 
and moisten well with cream. Bake until the apples are 
thoroughly done. Use no upper crust. 

Apple Meringue Pie. — Stew and sweeten ripe, juicy apples. 
Mash smooth, and season with nutmeg. Fill the crust, and 
bake until just done. Spread over the apple a thick me- 
ringue, made by whipping to a stiff froth the whites of three 
eggs ior each pie, sweetening with a tablespoonful of pow- 
dered sugar for each egg. Flavor this with vanilla ; beat 
until it will stand alone, and cover the pie three-quarters of 
an inch thick. Set back in the oven until the meringue is 
well set. Eat cold. 

Peach Meringue Pie. — Proceed as above in all respects, 
simply substituting peaches for apples. Whipped cream 
will make a delightful substitute for the whipped egg in 
either of these meringue pies. 

Peach Pie. — Bake rich shells about two-thirds done; if 
your peaches are fully ripe, cut them into halves or quarters- 



150 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

put in the shell, sweeten and flavor to taste, cover or not as 
you choose, and finish baking in a quick oven; if the 
peaches are ripe, but not soft, it will improve the flavor to 
sugar them down some hours before you wish to use them ; 
if not ripe, they should be steWed. 

Gooseberry Pie. — Stew the gooseberries with plenty of 
white sugar, and use plain pufl^paste for crust. 

Cherry Pie. — Having removed the stones, put in sugar as 
may be needed, and stew the cherries slowly till they are 
quite done, if you use shells, or till nearly done if you use 
paste. A few of the pits added in stewing increase the 
richness of the flavor ; but they should not go into the pies. 
If baked slowly the cherries need not be stewed at all. 

Rhubarb Pie. — Remove the skin from the stalks ; cut them 
in small pieces ; pour boiling water "over and let stand for 
ten minutes ; drain thoroughly ; then fill the pie-dish evenly 
full ; put in plenty of sugar, a little butter, and dredge a 
trifle of flour evenly over the top ; cover with a thin crust, 
and bake the same as apple pie. Equal quantities of apple 
and rhubarb used in the same manner make a very good pie. 

Pumpkin Pie. — Stew the pumpkin until thoroughly done, 
and pass it through a colander. To one quart of stewed 
pumpkin, add three eggs, and one pint of milk. Sweeten, 
and spice with ground ginger and cinnamon to taste. Add 
butter, rose water, and a little brandy. The quantity of 
milk used will vary as the pumpkin may be moist or dry. 

Sweet Potato Pie. — 'Scrape clean two good-sized sweet pota- 
toes; boil; when tender, rub through the colander; beat 
the yelks of three eggs light ; stir with a pint of sweet milk 
into the potato ; add a small teacupful of sugar, a pinch of 
salt; flavor with a little fresh lemon, or lemon extract; 
bake to a nice brown ; when done, make a meringue top with 
the whites of eggs and powdered sugar; brown this a 
moment in the oven. 



PASTRY AND PUDDINGS. 151 

Dried-Apple Pie. — To a pint of stewed dried-apples, 
passed through a colander, add a pint of sweet milk, 
three eggs, and three large tablespoonfuls of sugar, 
beaten well together as for custard. Spice with a tea- 
spoonful of cinnamon and half a teaspoonful of ground 
cloves. Bake with upper and under crusts. This 
quantity will make two pies. 

Prune Pie. — Stew the prunes until soft, then cool and 
remove the stones. Fill your dish with them, sweeten, 
and spice with a little cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. 
Bake with upper and under crust. 

Squash Pie. — One cup of stewed squash, one-half cup 
of sugar, two eggs, and milk enough to fill a pie-plate. 
First line pie-plate with crust, then beat eggs and sugar 
together, adding squash and milk. Season with cin- 
namon, nutmeg and allspice, to suit the taste. Bake 
till well done. 

Tbmato Pie. — Take ripe tomatoes, wash, peel, and cut 
in thin slices ; fill a pie-plate, lined with good paste, 
with them ; sprinkle well with sugar, and sift a little 
cinnamon and grated nutmeg over them ; add two tea- 
spoonfuls of vinegar and one of lemon-essence ; cover 
with crust and bake. 

Raisin Pie. — Take juice and yellow rind of one lemon ; 
one cup of raisins, one cup of water, one cup of rolled 
crackers, one cup of sugar. Stone the raisins and boil 
in water to soften them. Bake with upper and under 
crusts. 

Orange Pie. — One orange grated, five crackers rolled 
fine, a pint of sweet milk, two eggs well beaten, sugar 
to sweeten. Bake as a custard. 



152 THE HO USE WIFE'S LIBRAR Y. 

Custard Pie. — Take one quart of milk, five eggs, four table- 
spoonfuls of sugar, a small piece of butter. Sift over the 
top Durkee's mixed spice. 

Lemon Pie. — Let two cupfuls of water come to a boil ; put 
in two tablespoonfuls of corn-starch dissolved. When it 
has boiled enough, take it from the stove, add the juice and 
rind of two lemons, two cupfuls of sugar, a piece of butter . 
the size of a walnut, and the yelks of two eggs. Beat the 
whites of these eggs with pulverized sugar, and put on the 
top of the pies when done. Put into the oven to brown. 

Orange Pie. — Beat the yelks of three eggs until light, and 
add to them the juice and grated rind of one orange, three- 
quarters of a cupful of sugar, and a tablespoonful of corn- 
starch mixed in half a cupful of water. Bake without 
upper crust, using the whites of the eggs for meringue. 

Cream Pie. — One pint of milk, scalded ; two tablespoonfuls 
of corn-starch, three tablespoonfuls of sugar, yelks of two 
eggs. Wet the starch with a little cold milk ; beat the eggs 
and sugar until light, and stir the whole into the scalding 
milk. Flavor with lemon or vanilla, and set aside to cool. 
Line a plate with pie-crust and bake ; fill it with the cream, 
and cover with frosting made of the whites of the eggs, 
beaten dry, with two tablespoonfuls of sugar. Bake to a 
delicate brown. 

Cocoanut Pie. — One quart of milk, half a pound of grated 
cocoanut, three eggs, six tablespoonfuls of sugar, butter the 
size of an egg. Bake in open shells. 

Cheese-cake Pie. — This may be made from the above recipe, 
substituting cottage-cheese for the cocoanut. Sprinkle the 
top with Slade's Spices. 

Mince Pie. — Seven pounds beef, three and a half pounds 
beef suet, five pounds of raisins, two pounds of currants, 
one-half peck apples, four pounds sugar, three-quarters 



PASTRY AND PUDDINGS. 1 53 

of a pound of citron, one-quarter of a pound of preserved 
lemon, two large oranges, four nutmegs, half an o-ince of 
cinnamon, half an ounce of cloves, and three pints of brandy. 
This quantity of mince-meat will make from twenty to 
twenty-five pies. When making the pies, moisten the meat 
with sweet cider. 

Tarts. — Use the best of puff-paste; roll it out a little 
thicker than pie-crust, and cut with a large biscuit-cutter 
twice as many as you intend to have of tarts. Then cut 
out of half of these a small round in the centre, which will 
leave a circular rim of crust ; lift this up carefully, and lay 
it on the other pieces. Bake in pans, so providing both the 
bottom and the top crusts. Fill with any kind of preserves, 
jam, or jelly. 

Pineapple Tart — Take a fine, large, ripe pineapple; re- 
move the leaves and quarter it without paring, grate it down 
till you come to the rind ; strew plenty of powdered sugar 
over the grated fruit ; cover it, and let it rest for an hour; 
then put it into a porcelain kettle, and steam in its own sirup 
till perfectly soft ; have ready some empty shells of stiff- 
paste, or bake in patty-pans. When they are cool, fill them 
full with the grated pineapple; add more sugar, and lay 
round the rim a border of puff-paste. 

Tea Baskets. — Make a short, sweetened pie-crust ; roll thin, 
and partly bake in sheets ; before it is quite done take from 
the oven, cut in squares of four inches or so, take up two 
diagonal corners and pinch together, which makes them 
basket-shaped ; now fill with whipped cream, or white of 
egg, or both, well sweetened and flavored, and return to the 
oven for a few minutes. 

Strawberry Shortcake. — Make a good biscuit crust, and 
roll out about one-quarter of an inch thick, and cut into 
two r-akes the same size and shape ; spread one over lightly 
with melted butter, and lay the other over it, and bake in a.

hot oven. When done, they will fall apart. Butter them 
well as usual. Mix the berries with plenty of sugar, and 
set in a warm place until needed. Spread the berries and 
cakes in alternate layers, berries on the top, and over all 
spread whipped cream or charlotte russe. The juice that 
has run from the fruit can be sent to the table in a ttteen 
and served with the cake as it is cut. 

Strawberry Shortcake, No. 2. — Take one quart of flour and 
sift into it two teaspoonfuls of sea-foam, a little salt, quarter 
of a pound of butter rubbed in, with milk enough to moisten 
properly. Handle as little as possible, divide into two parts, 
roll each flat, and place in two jelly pans. Bake quickly, 
then split apart the top and bottom of each crust ; spread on 
plenty of butter, have the strawberries washed and drained 
in a sieve, crush them slightly, and sweeten well. Spread 
plenty of berries over each layer of the crust, and have some 
of the crushed and sweetened berries in a deep dish. When 
the cake is cut and served, cover each piece with the crushed 
berries, using this as sauce. 

Batter Pudding. — Beat the yelks and whites of four eggs 
separately, and mix them with six or eight ounces of flour 
and a saltspoonful of salt. Make the batter of the proper 
consistency by adding a little more than a pint of milk ; mix 
carefully; butter a baking-tin, pour the mixture into it, and 
bake three-quarters of an hour. Serve with vanilla sauce. 

Apple Batter Pudding. — Core and peel eight apples, put in 
a dish, fill the places from which the cores have been taken 
with brown sugar, cover and bake. Beat the yelks of four 
eggs light, add two teacupfuls of flour, three teaspoonfuls 
of Plume Baking Powder sifted with it, one pint of milk, 
and teaspoonful of salt, then the whites well beaten ; pour 
over the apples and bake. Use sauce with it. 

Suet Pudding. — Take a pint of milk, two eggs well beaten, 
half a pound of finely chopped suet, and a teaspoonful of 



PASTRY AND PUDDINGS. 155 

salt. Add flour gradually till you have a pretty thick batter; 
boil two hours, and eat with molasses. 

Suet Pudding, No. 2. — One cupful of suet or butter, one cup- 
ful of molasses, one bowlful of raisins and currants, one egg, 
one cupful of sweet milk, one teaspoonful of saleratus dis-

half of nutmeg. Mix stiff with flour and steam three hours. 
A fine sauce for this pudding may be made thus : One cup- 
ful of butter and two cupfuls of sugar, beat into a cream ; 
add three eggs beaten very light ; stir in two tablespoonfuls 
of boiling water. Flavor with wine, brandy, or vanilla. 

Hasty Pudding.— Wet a heaping cupful of Indian-meal and 
a half cupful of flour with a pint of milk ; stir it into a quart 
of boiling water. Boil hard for half an hour, stirring from 
the bottom almost constantly. Put in a teaspoonful of salt 
and a tablespoonful of butter, and simmer ten minutes 
longer. Turn into a deep, uncovered dish, and eat with 
sugar and cream, or sugar and butter with nutmeg. 

Baked Hasty Pudding. — Take from a pint of new milk suffi- 
cient to mix into a thin batter two ounces of flour, put the 
remainder, with a small pinch of salt, into a clean saucepan, 
and when it boils quickly, stir the flour briskly to it ; keep 
it stirred over a gentle fire for ten minutes, pour it out, and 
when it has become a little cool, mix with it two ounces of 
fresh butter, three of powdered sugar, the grated rind of a 
small lemon, four large or five small eggs, and half a glass 
of brandy or as much orange-flower water. Bake the pud- 
ding half an hour in a gentle oven. 

Minute Pudding. — Take six eggs, two tablespoonfuls of 
sugar, one cupful of flour, a lump of butter large as an egg, 
and half a nutmeg; you may add, if desired, a half pound 
of raisins ; mix well and bake quick.

and bake in a moderate oven. Serve with cream sauce. 

Plain Tapioca Pudding. — A cup not quite full of tapioca to 
a quart of milk ; let it stand on the side of the range till it 
swells ; add while hot a tablespoonful of butter and a cupful 
of white sugar, and let it cool ; then add five eggs (three 
will do quite well), well beaten, and flavor to your taste. To 
be baked from three-quarters of an hour to an hour. It is 
very nice when dressed with wine sauce, but may be eaten 
with plainer dressing. 

Tapioca and Apple Pudding. — One coffeecupful Slade's 
Quick Tapioca, one dozen good-flavored, tart apples, 
pared and cored, one quart water, a little salt. Cover

apples in a deep dish, put a little sugar and spice in the 
centre, pour over the tapioca, and bake one hour. 

Peaches may be substituted for apples, which will 
make a delightful dish. Serve with hard sauce. 

Vermicelli Pudding. — Into pint and a half of boiling milk 
drop four ounces fresh vermicelli, and keep it simmering 
and stirred gently ten minutes, when it will have become 
very thick ; then mix with it three and one-half ounces 
sugar, two ounces butter, and a little salt. When the 
whole is well blended, pour it out, beat for a few minutes to 
cool it, then add by degrees four well-beaten eggs and the

with lemon. It should be prepared for table by pouring into 
wet molds. 

Cocoannt Pudding. — One cocoanut finely grated (use both 
the meat and milk), one quart of milk, one cupful of sugar, 
five eggs, half a cupful of butter, a little salt, and a tea-

cocoanut, add the eggs well beaten, and the other ingre- 
dients, and bake in a deep aish, with or without an under- 
crust. 

Cocoanut Pudding, No. 2. — Put a pint of milk to boil in a 
farina kettle. Take four tablespoonfuls of corn-starch and 
dissolve it in a little cold milk, then stir it into the boiling 
milk. Add'half a cupful of sugar, the well-beaten whites of 
four eggs, half a grated cocoanut, and a teaspoonful of va- 
nilla extract ; turn into a mold to cool. For a suitable sauce 
put a pint of milk to boil, beat the yelks of four eggs with 
two tablespoonfuls of sugar till light, then add the boiling 
milk, with a tablespoonful of vanilla extract. Cook for two 
minutes in a farina kettle, then turn out to cool.

pint of the milk an hour, then set the saucepan containing 
it where it will slowly heat to a boil. Boil five minutes ; re- 
move and let it cool. Beat the eggs, add the sugar and but- 
ter, the rice and the milk in which it was cooked, with the 
pint of unboiled milk, and finally the raisins. Grate nut- 
meg on the top, and bake three-quarters of an hour, or 
until the custard is well set and of a light brown. Serve 
with hard brandy sauce. 

Rice Pudding, No. 2. — Three-quarters of a cupful of soaked 
rice, one cupful of sugar, three pints of milk, one table- 
spoonful of butter. Season with lemon rind or spice to 
taste. Bake three-quarters of an hour. 

Cottage Pudding: — Three cupfuls flour, or sufficient to 
make the batter ; one teaspoonful butter, one cupful sugar, 
two eggs, one cupful milk, half a teaspoonful soda, onetea- 
spoonful each of cream of tartar and salt ; mix the cream 
of tartar with the flour, beat the whites of the eggs ; put 
the butter, sugar, and yelks of the eggs together; then 
work in the milk, soda, and salt, adding gradually the flour 
and whites of the eggs ; there should be flour enough to 
make a fairly stiff batter ; butter a mold or dish, and bake ; 
it may be turned out or served from the dish ; to be eaten 
with any liquid, sauce. 

Itennet Pudding. — Take one quart of milk, and warm it 
enough to remove the chjll ; in summer it does not need 
warming at all ; stir into it three tablespoonfuls of granu- 
lated sugar, two of rose-water, and four of rennet wine ; stir 
it gently, not more than a minute ; let it stand, and do not 
move it till it is curdled, then place it gently in the ice chest 
and grate nutmeg on the top. Be careful not to shake it in 
moving, for if the curd is disturbed it will turn to whey.

six eggs very light, and stir them gradually into the mix- 
ture. Add. a glass of wine or brandy. Put the whole into 
a dish with a broad edge ; put round two of three layers of 
puff-paste. Bake half an hour, and when cold sprinkle white . 
sugar over it. Oranges may be used in the same way. To

Orange Pudding. — Two oranges— the juice of both and 
grated peel of one; juice of one lemon; one half-pound 
lady's-fingers — stale and crumbled ; two cupfuls of milk ; 
four eggs, one-half cupful sugar; one tablespoonful corn- 
starch, wet with water ; one tablespoonful butter, melted. 
Soak the crumbs in the cold milk, whip up light, and add the 
eggs and sugar, already beaten to a cream with the batter. 
Next add the corn-starch, and when the mold is buttered 
and water boiling hard, stir in the juice and peel of the 
fruit. Do this quickly, and plunge the mold directly into

Established 1863. 

ftt tS Cil iSY'ii^ilStt * nat * have made a Chemical Analysis of 
U\Z* Mi'KlimxZM the Compound Concentrated Extract of 
Water-White Vanilla made by the Theodore Metcalf Co. of 
Boston . I have been informed by them of the full details of their 
process, and I have repeatedly witnessed the same in practical 
operation in their laboratory. I am able to report as follows : 
The compound extract of Water-White Vanilla is prepared as 
follows. Vanilla Beans, in quantity fully equal to the amount required by 
standard formulas, or as shown by analysis to be employed by the best known 
manufacturers, are treated in the usual manner with alcohol, as in the prep- 
aration of all Vanilla Extracts. From this product thus obtained from the 
bean itself, all coloring matter and all constituents which tend to deteriorate 
the extract either in aroma, flavor or keeping qualities, are removed by a new 
and original process discovered and exclusively practiced by the Theodore 
Metcalf Co. The extract of Vanilla thus obtained is water-white, and when its 
aroma and flavor are still further developed by unobjectionable additions, 
under conditions which secure the perfect keeping qualities of this product, it 
is ready for use and is put upon the market. It is absolutely free from any 
constituent whose presence is not authorized by standard and accepted formulas 
for the preparation of extract of vanilla. 

I have examined the extract of Vanilla contained in original unbroken 
packages made by three of the best known manufacturers in this vicinity, and 
I have made comparative tests of these and of the " Water- White Vanilla." As 
the result of these tests I am able to state that the latter has the following 
distinct points of superiority : — 

FIRST. The clean and agreeable flavor and aroma, with no unpleasant 
aftertaste, of the "Water- White Vanilla," are markedly superior to either of 
the other extracts. 

SECOND. The strength or flavoring capacity of the "Water- White 
Vanilla ' ' is from one and a half to two and a half times as great as that of either 
of the other extracts. This may be easily verified by anyone who cares to try 
the experiment. 

THIRD. The " Water- White Vanilla " is free from color. 
FOURTH. The keeping qualities of the " Water- White Vanilla " are un- 
impaired by unstable extractive matters or other objectionable substances. 

FIFTH. The " Water- White Vanilla" will not become cloudy with age 
or deposit a muddy and unsightly sediment, however long kept.

RECIPES FOR CREAMS, JELLIES, BLANC-MANGES, ETC. 



THERE is a delightful range of light desserts which need 
to be introduced more generally into our homes. 
They have too long been allowed to rest in the con- 
fectioner's under the erroneous notion that they were be- 
yond the capacity of the ordinary housekeeper. 

Prominent among these desserts are ice-cream and water- 
ices with all their splendid possibilities of variety. 



RECIPES. 

Vanilla Ice-cream. — Two quarts of pure cream, fourteen 
ounces of white sugar, flavored with vanilla bean or extract 
of vanilla to taste ; mix well, and freeze as directed 
above. Pure cream needs no thickening or boiling. Milk 
may be boiled or thickened with arrow-root or corn- 
starch, but it will not produce ice cream. 

Lemon Ice-cream. — For the same quantity of cream and 
sugar, as above, stir in the juice of from four to eight 
lemons, according to size and juiciness, and grate in a little 
of the rind. Then freeze as above. 

Orange Ice-cream. — Proceed as in lemon cream, using 
oranges, and regulating the quantity of sugar as the fruit is 
more or less sweet. 



168 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Chocolate Ice-cream. — For one gallon of ice-cream, grate 
fine about one-half cake of Bensdorp's Chocolate; make 
ice-cream as for the recipe above ; flavor lightly with 
Metcalf's Water White Vanilla and stir in the chocolate. 

Strawberry Ice-cream. — Mash one pint of fresh, ripe straw- 
berries ; sprinkle them with half a pound of fine sugar ; let • 
it stand about an hour ; strain though a fine sieve, or a 
cloth ; if the sugar is not dissolved, stir it well ; add a little 
water; stir this juice into the cream prepared as above and 
freeze. 

Raspberry Ice-cream. — Make the same as strawberry, sub- 
stituting the raspberries merely. 

Peach Ice-cream. — Take fine, ripe freestone peaches ; pare, 
chop fine, mash, and work as for strawberry cream. 

Pine-apple Ice-cream, — Pare the fruit, shred fine, and work as 
in strawberry cream. 

Orange Water-ice. — Take one dozen oranges; grate the 
skin and squeeze out the juice; add six quarts of water 
and ten ounces of white sugar to each quart of water ; mix 
well and put into the freezer. Be careful to stir steadily 
while freezing, or the mixture will cake into lumps. The 
amount of sugar and of orange-juice may be varied to suit 
taste. 

Lemon Water-ice. — To one quart oi water, add the juice of 
four lemons and one pound of sugar. Then proceed as 
above. Currants, raspberries, strawberries, and all the juicy 
fruits may be treated in the same way. 

Tutti PrnttL — One quart of rich cream, one and one-half 
ounces of sweet almonds, chopped fine ; one-half pound 
of sugar j freeze, and when sufficiently congealed, add one- 



CREAMS, JELLIES, AND LIGHT DESSERTS. 169 

half pound of preserved fruits, with a few white raisins 
chopped, and finely sliced citron. Cut the fruit small, and 
mix well with the cream. Freeze like ice-cream, and keep 
on ice until required. 

Frozen Fruits. — Take two quarts of rich cream and two 
teacupfuls of sugar, mix well together and put into a freezer 
with ice and salt packed around it. Have ready one quart 
of peaches, mashed and sweetened. When the cream is 
very cold, stir them in and freeze all together. Strawberries 
can be used in the same way, but will require more sugar. 
Cherries are specially delightful in this form. 

Whipped Cream. — To one quart of cream whipped very 
thick, add powdered sugar to taste ; then add one tumbler 
of wine. Make just before using. 

Italian Cream. — Divide two pints of cream equally in two 
bowls ; with one bowl mix six ounces of powdered sugar, 
the juice of two large lemons, and two glassfuls of white 
wine ; then add the other pint of cream, and stir the whole 
very hard; boil two ounces of isinglass with four small tea- 
cupfuls of water till reduced one-half; then stir the isinglass, 
lukewarm, in the other ingredients ; put them in a glass dish 
to harden. 

Syllabub. — Whip a small cupful of powdered sugar into a 
quart of rich cream, and another cupful of sugar into the 
whites of four eggs. Mix these together, and add a glass 
of white wine and flavoring to taste. 

Spanish. Cream. — Soak one-half box of Swampscott 
Sparkling Gelatine in one-half cup water fifteen minutes ; 
add three pints milk, one cup sugar, one teaspoonful of 
Metcalf's Water White Vanilla, and yolks of six eggs ; 
cook ten minutes ; stir constantly. Add whites beaten 
to stiff froth ; beat five minutes. Mould and cool. 



170 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Strawberry Sherbet. — Dissolve one tablespoonful gela- 
tine in half pint of water ; add juice of one lemon ; pour 
over one quart of mashed strawberries mixed with one 
pint of sugar; freeze in the same manner as ice-cream. 

Tapioca Cream. — Soak half a cupful of tapioca in water 
over night. Let a quart of milk get steaming hot, and add 
to it the tapioca. Let it boil three minutes, then mix five 
tablespoonfuls of white sugar with the yelks of four eggs ; 
stir them into the milk and tapioca, and let it come to a boil 
again. Beat the whites up stiff; stir them rapidly and 
thoroughly through the boiling tapioca; add two table- 
spoonfuls of wine and a pinch of salt. Let it stand till 
cold and garnish with macaroons. 

Orange Cream. — Put half a box of gelatine to soak for half 
an hour in cold water enough to cover it. Take three half- 
pints of cream, whip half of it, and heat the other half; dis- 
solve the gelatine in the heated cream ; then strain it, and 
return to the boiler again. Take the yelks of five eggs and 
a cupful of sugar ; beat them together till light, and add to 
the boiling cream ; cook about two minutes, stirring con- 
stantly ; take from the fire, and while it cooks, stir in the 
whipped cream and the juice of four oranges, and pour into 
a mold to stiffen. Stir the cream constantly before putting 
into the mold, to prevent it from thickening in lumps. 

Pink Cream. — Three gills of strawberry or currant juice ; 
mix with one-half pound of powdered sugar, one-half pint of 
thick cream ; whisk until well mixed ; serve in a glass dish. 

Bavarian Cream.' — Whip one pint of cream to a stiff 
froth, laying it on a sieve ; boil a pint of rich milk, add 
one teaspoonful Metcalf's Water White Vanilla and two 
tablespoonfuls sugar ; then take it off the fire and add l 
half a box Swampscott Sparkling Gelatine, soaked for an 
hour in half a cupful water. Stir in whites of six eggs 



CREAMS, JELLIES, AND LIGHT DESSERTS. \1\ 

well-beaten. When it has become quite cold and begins to 
thicken, stir it without ceasing a few minutes, until it is very 
smooth ; then stir in the whipped cream lightly until it is 
well mixed. Put it into a mold or molds, and set it on ice 
or in a cool place. 

Turret Cream. — Soak one box of gelatine in a cupful of 
milk four hours. Scald three cupfuls of milk; add one cup- 
ful of the sugar; when this is dissolved, add the soaked 
gelatine. Stir over the fire until almost boiling hot ; strain 
and. divide into two equal portions. Return one to the fire 
and heat quickly. When it nears the boiling-point, stir in 
the beaten yelks of three eggs. Let all cook together two 
minutes, and turn out into a bowl to cool. When it has 
cooled, churn one pint of cream very stiff, and beat the 
whites of the eggs until they will stand alone. Divide the 
latter into two heaps. As the yellow gelatine begins to 
" form," whip one-half of the whites into it, a little at a time. 
To the white gelatine add the rest of the whites in the same 
manner, alternately with the whipped cream. Season the 
yellow with vanilla, the white with lemon juice beaten in at 
the last. Wet the inside of a tall, fluted mold with water, 
and arrange in the bottom, close to the outside of the mold, 
a row of crystallized cherries. Then put in a layer of the 
white mixture; on this crystallized apricots or peaches cut 
into strips ; a layer of the yellow, another border of cherries, 
and so on until your mold is full. When firm, which will be 
in a few hours if set on ice, wrap a cloth wrung out in hot 
water about the mold, and invert upon a flat dish. Eat with 
sweet cream, or, if you like, with brandied fruit. Not only 
is this a very palatable dish, but it is also very beautiful, well 
repaying the trouble of its preparation. 

Velvet Cream. — Half an ounce of isinglass dissolved in one 
and a half cupfuls of white wine ; then add the juice and 
grated peel of a lemon, three-quarters of a pound of loaf 



172 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

sugar ; simmer all together until mixed well ; strain and 
add one and a half pints rich cream, and stir until cool ; 
pour into molds and let stand till stiff enough to turn out. 

Calf's Foot Jelly. — Take one pair of- calf's feet and put 
them into a gallon of water ; let it boil half away and 
skim constantly ; strain it when cold ; take the fat from 
the top and bottom, then warm it ; add sugar, the juice 
of three lemons, a pint of Madeira wine, and the whites 
of seven eggs ; boil it half an hour, strain through a 
flannel bag, and cool in molds. 

Wine Jelly. — One box of Swampscott Sparkling Gela- 
tine dissolved in one pint of cold water, one pint of wine, 
one quart of boiling water, two cupfuls of granulated 
sugar, and three lemons. Cool in molds. 

Wine Jelly, No. 2. — Soak one package of Swampscott 
Sparkling Gelatine in a large cupful of cold water. Add 
to this all the juice and half the rind of a lemon, two 
cupfuls of white sugar, and a half teaspoonful of bitter 
almond or two peach leaves, and cover for half an hour ; 
then pour on boiling water, stir and strain. After add- 
ing two cupfuls of pale sherry or white wine, strain 
again through a flannel bag. Cool in molds. 

Jelly Oranges. — Soak a package of Swampscott Spark- 
ling Gelatine about fifteen minutes in a cup of cold 
water. Cut from the top of each of a dozen fine oranges 
a round piece, leaving a hole just large enough to admit 
the bowl of a small spoon. Clean out the pulp, so as 
not to tear the edges of the hole. Scrape the inner 
skin from the sides with your forefinger, and when 
the oranges are emptied lay them in cold water. 
Strain the juice of all and grated peel of three of the 
oranges through coarse, thin muslin over three cupfuls of 
sugar, squeezing rather hard to get the coloring matter. 



CREAMS, JELLZES, AND LIGH7 DESSERTS. 173 

Stir this until it is a thick sirup, and add a quarter teaspoon- 
ful of cinnamon. Pour two cupfuls of boiling water upon the 
soaked gelatine, and stir over the fire until well dissolved ; 
add the juice and sugar, stir all together, and strain through 
a flannel bag into a pitcher, not shaking or squeezing it, lest 
it should become cloudy. Wipe off the outside of the 
oranges, set them close together in a dish, the open ends 
uppermost, and fill very full with the warm jelly, as it will 
shrink in cooling. Set it away in a cold place where there 
is no dust. Next day cut each in half with a sharp knife, 
taking care to sever the skin all around before cutting into 
the jelly. If neatly divided, the rich amber jelly will be a 
fair counterfeit of the orange pulp. Pile in a glass dish, 
with green leaves around, as you would the real fruit. This 
is a delicious dish, and it is highly ornamental on the table. 

Apple Jelly. — Soak half a package Swampscott Spark- 
ling Gelatine in one cupful cold water. Pare, core and 
slice a dozen well flavored pippins, throwing each piece 
into cold water as it is cut to preserve the color. Pack 
them in a glass or stoneware jar with just cold water 
enough to cover them; cover the jar loosely, that the 
steam may escape ; set in a pot of warm water and bring 
to a boil. Cook until the apples are broken into pieces. 
Have ready in a bowl the soaked gelatine, two cupfuls 
powdered sugar, the juice of two lemons, and the grated 
peel of one. Strain the apple pulp scalding hot over 
them; stir until- the gelatine is dissolved; strain again 
through a flannel bag, without shaking or squeezing it ; 
wet a mold with cold water, fill it,~and set in a cold place 
until firm. This preparation is greatly improved if 
formed in a mold with a cylinder in the centre, the cav- 
ity being filled and heaped with whipped cream. 

Coffee Jelly. — Take half a box of sparkling gelatine, 
three-quarters of a pound of sugar, pint of strong coffee ;

is dissolved stir the sugar in, adding at the same time 
one-half pint of boiling water ; when thoroughly mixed, 
strain into molds and serve with whipped cream. 

Orange Jelly. — Soak one-half box of Swampscott 
Sparkling Gelatine in one-half cup cold water fifteen 
minutes ; add one cup boiling water, juice of one lemon,

the hot liquid over them. Should the gelatine not dissolve 
readily, set all oyer the fire and stir until clear. Strain, and 
stir in the beaten yelks of three eggs. Heat quickly within 
a vessel of boiling water, stirring constantly lest the yelks 
curdle. If they do curdle, strain again through coarse flan- 
nel. Set aside until perfectly cold and slightly stiff, then 
whip in a pint of frothed cream. Wet a mold, fill, and set it 
on ice. 

Orange Dessert — Pare five or six oranges ; cut into thin 
slices ; pour over them a coffeecupfui of sugar. Boil one 
pint of milk ; add, while boiling, the yelks of three eggs, 
one tablespoonful of eorn-starch (made smooth with a little 
cold milk) ; stir all the time ; as soon as thickened, pour 
over the fruit. Beat the whites of the eggs to a froth ; add 
two tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar ; pour over the cus- 
tard, and brown slightly in the oven. Serve cold.

a la Genevieve. — Dissolve two ounces of best sugar 
in half a pint of cold water in an enameled stewpan, with 
half the very thin rind of a large lemon ; when this is done, 
put into it half a pound of Turkey figs, and put the stew- 
pan over a moderate fire, so that the figs may stew very 
slowly ; when quite soft, add one glassful of common port 
or any other wine, and the strained juice of half a lemon ; 
serve them cold for dessert. About two hours or two hours 
and a half is the average time for stewing the figs, and the 
flavor may be varied by using orange peel and juice in- 
stead of lemon, and by boiling two or three bitter almonds 
in the sirup. 

Biscuit Glace. — Make a quart of rich boiled custard, flavor 
it with vanilla, and let it cool. Then mix with it a quart of 
grated pineapple or mashed peaches. Stir them well to-

BEST MATERIALS REQUISITE FOR CAKE-MAKING; WHAT THEY 
SHOULD BE; WEIGHING AND MEASURING INGREDIENTS; HOW 
TO MIX CAKEJ FRUITS AND FLAVORS FOR CAKE; HOW TO BAKE 
CAKE ; HOW TO TEST IT ; HOW TO KEEP IT ; HOW TO ICE IT. 
NINETY-NINE RECIPES FOR CAKES. 

iN cake-making it is absolutely essential that the best 
materials be employed. Stale eggs, strong butter, musty 
flour, or common sugar are not so much as to be 
thought of in this connection. The idea that such refuse 
" will do for cooking " is most unworthy. When a luxury, 
such as cake, is attempted, the maker should certainly be 
willing to luxuriate in acceptable ingredients. 

Flour for cake should be white and dry. It should always 
be carefully sifted. Sugar should be white, dry, and free 
from lumps. Eggs and butter should be sweet and fresh ; 
the milk rich and pure. Fruit and extracts must be of the 
best. The weighing and measuring of ingredients must be 
accurately done. Guessing at quantities has spoiled many 
a cake. 

For mixing cake, an earthen or wooden dish and a 
wooden spoon are requisite. Butter and sugar should be 
beaten together to a cream before using. Butter may be 
softened for this purpose, if too hard to manage readily, but 
it must not be melted. Whites and yelks of eggs must be 
beaten separately, until there is no stringiness visible, and 
the froth can be taken up on a spoon. Beat eggs in a broad, 
shallow dish, and in a cool place. It is well to lay the eggs 
in cold water for an hour before beating them, as they will 
beat the lighter for such treatment. Sweet milk is best for 

179 



180 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

solid cake ; sour milk, for light cake. The two should never 
be mixed. 

Baking-powder should be mixed dry through the flour. 
Soda and cream of tartar should be dissolved in niilk. 
Flavoring extracts, fruit, and spices must be added the last 
thing, and fruit should always be well sprinkled with flour 
before it is put in the dough. Currants and such fruit 
should be washed, picked over, and dried before using. 
Almonds should be blanched by pouring boiling water over 
them till they pop from their skins. Cake should be beaten 
as little as possible after the flour has been added. When 
it requires long baking, the bottom and sides of the pan 
should be lined with paper well buttered. This will insure 
the easy turning out of the cake when done. 

Much of the success in cake-baking depends on the heat- 
ing of the oven. If the oven is very hot when the cake 
goes in, it will bake on top before it becomes light. If the 
oven is too cool, it will rise and fall again before done. If 
the top of the cake browns too fast, cover it with thick 
paper. Try it by inserting a broom-splinter or knitting- 
needle in the thickest part of the cake, and if nothing ad- 
heres when it is drawn out, it is done. Turn out of the tins 
at once, taking care not to expose the cake to draft. 

Cake should be kept in earthen pans or crocks, or tin 
boxes, but never in wooden boxes or drawers. It will keep 
better for being wrapped in a cloth, and more than is needed 
should not be cut. 

Cake that is to be frosted should be baked in pans with 
perpendicular sides. The icing should be put on as soon 
as the cake is removed from the oven. This will insure its 
drying smooth and hard.

over the surface to make them shiny. Bake three-quarters 
erf an hour in a very moderate oven. 



CAKES AND CAKE-BAKING, 197 

Chocolate Macaroons. — Put three ounces of plain Bens- 
dorp's Chocolate in a pan, and melt on a slow fire ; then 
work it to a thick paste with one pound of powdered 
sugar and the whites of three eggs ; roll the mixture 
down to the thickness of about one-quarter of an inch ; 
cut it in small, round pieces with a paste-cutter, either 
plain or scalloped ; butter a pan slightly, and dust it with 
flour and sugar in equal quantities ; place in it the pieces 
of paste or mixture, and bake in a hot but not quick oven. 

Cream Puffs. — Stir one-half pound.of butter into a pint of 
warm water, set it on the fire in a saucepan, and slowly 
bring it to a boil, stirring often. When it boils, put in three- 
quarters of a pound of flour, and let it boil one minute, stir- 
ring constantly. Take from the fire, and turn into a- deep 
dish to cool. Beat eight eggs light, and whip into this cool 
paste, first the yelks, then the whites. Drop in great spoon- 
fuls on buttered paper so as not to touch or run into each 
other, and bake ten minutes. Split them, and fill with the 
following cream : One quart of milk, four tablespoonfuls of 
corn-starch, two eggs, two cupfuls of sugar. Stir while boil- 
ing, and when thick, add a teaspoonful of butter. When 
cold, flavor. 

Esses. — Beat the whites of four eggs very stiff, add one- 
half pound of pulverized sugar, and flavor to taste. Beat 
until very light, then lay in heaps the size of an egg on 
paper. Place the paper on a piece of wood half an inch 
thick, and put in a hot oven. Make the surface shiny by 
passing over it a wet knife. Bake until they look yellowish, 
when they are done. 

Chocolate Kisses. — Beat stiff whites of two eggs ; beat in 
gradually one-half pound powdered sugar. Scrape fine 
one and a half ounces Bensdorp's Chocolate ; dredge with 
flour, mix the flour well ; add gradually to the eggs and 
sugar ; stirring very hard. Cover bottom of a pan with 



1 98 THE HO USE WIFE' S LIBRAR Y. 

white paper, and place on it spots of powdered sugar the 
size of half-dollars. Heap the mixture on these spots, 
smooth with a broad knife, sift with powdered sugar, and 
bake quickly. 

Cocoanut Steeples. — One pound of powdered sugar; one- 
half pound of grated cocoanut ; whites of five eggs. Whip 
the eggs as for icing, adding the sugar as you go on urtil it 
will stand alone, then beat in the cocoanut. Mold the mix- 
ture with your hands into small cones, and set these fai 
enough apart not to touch one another upon buttered paper 
in a baking-pan. Bake in a very moderate oven. 

Meringues. — Mix the whites of four eggs, beaten to a stiff 
froth, with one pound of pulverized sugar, and flavored to 
the taste. Beat stiff, bake the same as macaroons, when 
light brown, slip them from the papers, and put the smooth 
sides together, with jelly between. 

Lady-fingers. — One-half pound pulverized sugar and six 
yelks of eggs, well stirred ; add one-fnurth pound flour, 
whites of six eggs, well beaten. Bake \i% lady-finger tins, 
or squeeze through a bag of paper in strips two or three 
inches long. 

Lady-fingers, No. 2. — Rub half a pound of butter into a 
pound of flour ; to this add half a pound of sugar, the juice 
and grated rind of one large lemon, and, lastly, three eggs, 
the whites and yelks beaten separately, and the whites stirred 
in after all the other ingredients are well mixed together. 
This dough, if properly made, will be stiff enough to make 
rolls about the size of a lady's finger ; it will spread when 
in the oven, so that it will be of the right size and shape. 
If you wish them to be especially inviting, dip them in cho- 
colate icing after they are baked, and put two together. 
See that the icing is so hard that it will not run, and set the 
cakes on a platter in a cool room untUthe icing is firm, 



CAKES AND CAKE-BAKING. J 99 

Eclairs a la Creme. — Three-fourths pound flour, one pint 
water, ten eggs, one-half cupful butter. Put the water on 
the fire in a stewpan with the butter ; as soon as it boils 
stir in the sifted flour ; stir well until it leaves the bottom 
and sides of the pan, when taken from the fire ; then add 
the eggs, one at a time. Put the batter in a bag of paper, 
and press out in the shape of fingers on a greased tin. 
When cold, fill with cream, prepared as follows : One and 
one-half pints of milk, two cupfuls sugar, yelks of five eggs, 
one tablespoonful butter, three large tablespoonfuls corn- 
starch, two teaspoonfuls extract vanilla. Frosted with choco- 
late, they are much improved in appearance and flavor. 

Icing for Cakes. — In making icing, use at least a quarter of 
a pound of pulverized sugar to the white of each egg ; if 
not stiff enough, add more sugar. Break the whites into a 
broad, cool dish, and throw in a small handful of sugar. 
Begin whipping it in with long, even strokes of the beater, 
adding the sugar gradually. Beat until the icing is smooth 
and firm, then add the flavoring. Spread it on the cake 
with a broad-bladed knife, dipped in cold water. If orna- 
mentation of the icing is desired, it may be done by affixing 
prepared leaves, flowers, etc., which can be had at the con- 
fectioners' stores or at their supply stores. To make letters, 
tracery, etc., for cakes, roll into a funnel shape a piece of 
thick, white paper; fill this with icing in the soft state, 
allowing it to drip out slowly from the small end of the 
paper cone. Apply this carefully, and allow it to harden. 

Orange Icing. — Whites of two eggs, one-half pound of 
pulverized sugar, and the juice of a large orange, treated 
as above. 

Lemon Icing. — Whites of two eggs, one-half pound of 
pulverized sugar, juice and part of the rind of one lemon. 

Chocolate Icing. — Whites of two eggs, one-half pound of 



200 iHE HOUSE WlFhH LIBRARY. 

pulverized sugar, and three tablespoonfuls of grated 
Bensdorp's Chocolate. 

Almond Icing. — The whites of three eggs, one cupful of 
pounded blanched almonds, three-quarters of a pound of 
pulverized sugar, and a little almond extract. 

Banana Icing. — Whites of two eggs, one-half pound of pul- 
verized sugar, and one banana finely crushed through it. 
This cake should be eaten the same day it is made, as the 
banana discolors over night. 

Cocoannt Frosting. — Whites of two eggs, one-half pound 
of pulverized sugar. Spread on the cake, then sprinkle 
thickly with grated cocoanut. This will make a whiter frost- 
ing than results from stirring in the cocoanut. 

Cooked Frosting. — One cupful of granulated sugar, wet 
with a little water. Let it boil without stirring until it be- 
gins to thicken. Beat the whites of two eggs very light 
Strain the boiled sugar into them slowly, beating all the 
time. Flavor to taste.

XIV.— FRESH FRUITS AND NUTS. 

VALUE OF FRESH FRUITS ON THE TABLE; ABUNDANCE OF FRUITSJ 
NUTRITIVE VALUE OF FRUITSJ WHERE TO GATHER AND HOW 
TO STORE FRUITS. TWENTY-TWO RECIPES FOR SERVING FRESH 
FRUITS AND NUTS. 

FRESH fruits are a most delightful accessory to the 
table supply of both rich and poor. They are so great 
in variety, so rich in flavor, so beautiful in appearance, 
so healthful, and of so long continuance in most parts of the 
country, that it behooves every housekeeper to familiarize 
herself with the best methods of using fresh fruits to 
advantage. 

A few years ago each locality depended upon its own 
local crop of fruits. Now the railroads bring early fruits 
from the far South and late fruits from the far North, so 
that at the centres of population the several fruit seasons are 
"delightfully prolonged. Nor are we restricted to our own 
country's production. Such are the facilities for rapid and 
safe communication from distant points, that the world lays 
her tribute of fruits, sweet and sound, at the door of the 
enlightened nations. 

Fruits do not take an important place as nutrients. They 
belong rather among the luxuries, and yet, as an agreeable 
stimulant to digestion, they occupy a front rank. In many 
conditions of health, some of the fruits are the only articles 
the invalid can enjoy, and their genial influences contribute 
greatly to the general improvement of a patient's appetite. 

Fruits intended for immediate use should be gathered 
early in the morning, while the coolness of the night dews 

201 



202 THE HOUSEWIFE S LIBRARY. 

is upon them. They should be just ripe, neither overdone 
nor underdone, in nature's great process of preparing them 
for human food. Fruit for storage is best gathered at the 
middle of a dry day. It should be nearly ripe. If unripe, 
or overripe it will not keep well. A moist atmosphere, but 
not one positively damp, is best for the storing of fruit. An 
ordinary cellar does better than a dry storeroom. Fruit 
keeps better in the dark than in the light. 

All varieties of nuts belong to the albuminous fruits and 
are very nutritious, though the richer nuts are not easy 
of digestion owing to their oily properties. 

The supply of peanuts once came wholly from Africa, but 
our Southern States have so successfully cultivated this 
popular nut that we are now independent. The bulk of the 
supply is from Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee. 
During a single season the crop of Virginia rose to one 
million one hundred thousand bushels, of Tennessee, five 
hundred and fifty thousand bushels, and of North Carolina, 
one hundred and twenty thousand bushels. 

The Texas pecan is especially in demand. While a few 
years ago several barrels of pecans abundantly supplied the 
demand, carloads and invoices of one or two hundred bar- 
rels are not now uncommon. 

In the Eastern States hickory nuts are sufficiently plenti- 
ful to ship to New York half a dozen carloads a week when 
demanded. 

The chestnut is becoming scarcer every year, but their 
great popularity will probably prevent their total disappear- 
ance, as they are already being successfully cultivated, and 
it is expected that in a few years the cultivated nut will equal 
in quality the high-priced Italian chestnuts. 

RECIPES. 

Watermelons. — Wipe watermelons clean when they are 
taken from the ice. They should lie on ice for at - least four 



fi&ESff F&UlTS AND NUTS. 203 

hours before they are eaten. Cut off a slice at each end of 
the watermelon, then cut through the centre ; stand on end 
on platter, and slice down, allowing each slice a part of the 
centre, or heart. 

Nutmegs, eta — Wash nutmegs and muskmelons ; wipe 
dry ; cut in two ; shake out the seeds lightly, and put a 
lump of ice in each half. Eat with pepper and salt. A sil- 
ver spoon is a neat and pleasant article with which to eat 
small, ripe melons. 

Pineapples. — Slice on a slaw-cutter, or very thin with a 
knife ; mix with finely powdered sugar. Set on ice till ready 
to serve. 

Oranges are nice served whole, the skins quartered and 
turned down. Form in a pyramid with bananas and white 
grapes. 

Orange and Cocoanut. — A layer of oranges sliced, then 
sugar, then a layer of cocoanut, grated ; then another of 
oranges, and so on until the dish is full. This is by many 
known as Ambrosia. 

Sliced Peaches. — Peel and slice ripe peaches. Lay them in 
a dish with plenty of sugar for an hour or two, till tea time. 
Eat with cream. 

Stewed Peaches. — Make a sirup of sugar and water ; halve 
the peaches, leaving the stone in one half, and drop into 
sirup. Allow the whole to simmer slowly until fruit is ten- 
der; then remove fruit, and let sirup boil till thick; then pour 
over fruit and serve at once. 

Frosted Peaches. — Put half a cupful of water and the 
beaten whites of three eggs together ; dip in each peach, 
using fine, large freestones, after you have rubbed off 
the fur with a clean cloth ; and then, roll in powdered sugar. 
Set them on the stem end, upon a sheet of white paper, in 
a sunny window. When half dry, roll again in the sugar. 



204 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Expose to the sun and breeze until perfectly dry. Until 
ready to arrange them in the glass dish for table, keep in 
a cool, dry place. Decorate with green leaves. 

Fried Peaches. — Cut the peaches in two, and remove the 
stones. Dust a little flour on the side from which the stone 
is taken, and fry, only on that side, in a little butter. When 
done, add sugar and a little butter. 

Baked Apples. — Pare and core good, sound, tart apples. 
Fill them with sugar, butter, and a flavor of spice. Put a 
little water in the pan, and bake until the apples are 
thoroughly tender. 

Apple Sauce. — Pare, core, and slice nice, juicy apples that 
are not very sweet ; put them in a stewpan with a little 
grated lemon peel, and water enough to keep them from 
burning. Stew till soft and tender ; mash to a paste, and 
sweeten well with brown sugar, adding a little butter and 
nutmeg. 

Apples with Lemon. — Make a sirup of sugar and water. 
Slice a lemon into it, and let boil until clear. Pare and core 
sound, tart apples, cut into quarters, and lay them carefully 
into the sirup ; let them cook gently until a straw can be 
run through them, taking care not to break them. Lay the 
pieces of apple in a glass dish, boil down the sirup, and 
when slightly cool, pour over the apples. 

Apple Float. — Pare, slice, and stew six large apples in as 
much water as will cover them ; when well done, press them 
through a sieve and sweeten highly with crushed sugar; 
while cooling, beat the whites of four eggs to a stiff froth, 
and stir into the apples ; flavor with lemon or vanilla ; serve 
with plenty of sweet cream. 

Transparent Apple. — Boil tart, ripe, and juicy apples in a 
little water; then strain through a fine cloth, and add a 
pound of white sugar to a pint of juice. Boil till it jellies, 



FRESH FRUITS AND NUTS. 205 

and then put into molds. It is veiy nice served with blanc- 
mange in saucers. 

Baked Pears. — Place in a stone jar, first a layer of pears, 
with their skins on, then a layer of sugar, then pears, and so 
on until the jar is full. Then put in as much water as it 
will hold. Bake three hours. 

• Quinces. — Bake ripe quinces thoroughly ; when cold, strip 
off the skins, place the quinces in a glass dish, and sprinkle 
them with white sugar ; serve with rich cream. 

Bananas and Cream. — Peel, slice, and heap up in a glass 
dessert-dish, and serve raw, with fine sugar and cream. 

Pried Bananas. — Cut the bananas into slices, and fry in a 
little butter. This makes a very rich dish. 

Stewed Rhubarb. — Carefully remove the outer stringy 
skin ; then cut in pieces an inch long, and simmer gently till 
tender in water and sugar, and the rind and juice of a lemon. 
When done add a bit of butter and nutmeg. 

Crystallized Fruit. — Pick out the finest of any kind of fruit; 
leave in the stones ; beat the whites of three eggs to a stiff 
froth; lay the fruit in the beaten egg, with the stems 
upward ; drain them, and beat the part that drips off again ; 
select them out, one by one, and dip them into finely pow- 
dered sugar ; cover a pan with a sheet of fine paper, place 
the fruit on it, and set it in a cool place ; when the icing on 
the fruit becomes firm, pile them on a dish, and set them in 
a cold place. 

Candied Fruits. — Make a very rich sirup with one pound 
of granulated sugar to a gill of water. Heat over boiling 
water till the sugar is dissolved. Pare and halve fine, ripe, 
but solid peaches. Put a single layer of them in the sirup, 
in a shallow vessel ; cook slowly until clear ; drain from the 
sirup, and put to dry in a moderately heated oven. When 
fairly dry they may be eaten at once; or, after drying 



206 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

twenty-four hours, they may be packed for future use. 
Plums, cherries, and pears may be candied in the same 
manner. 

Nuts. — Almonds are inseparably joined with raisins in 
table service ; so for evening uses, hickory nuts and apples 
form a pleasant combination. All the harder-shelled nuts 
should be well cracked before they are served. With the 
softer-shelled, nut crackers should be furnished. Nut picks 
should always be at hand. 

Sweet almonds, which are used for dessert, are of several 
varieties. Those known as the Syrian, or Jordan almonds, 
are regarded as the best. Those with hard shells are gen- 
erally richer in flavor than those with the soft. Certainly 
the harder shell offers the more effective protection. The 
skin of almonds is not easily digested. For use in cooking 
they should be blanched, but for table use this is not desir- 
able. Walnuts keep well and improve with age. Of the 
hickory-nut family, the shell-bark is considered best. These, 
too, are the better for age.

pru1t for jellies, jams, and preserves j how prepared) 
proper sugar to use ; quantity of sugar needed ; suitable 
preserving-kettles; what not to use; the fire; cans 
and jars; where stored; molding the jelly ; the jelly- 
bag ; straining jelly ; covering jelly, forty-four recipes 
for jellies, jams, and preserves. 

TO insure success in preserving fruits, the first thing to 
be looked after is the fruit itself. This should be fully 
ripe, fresh, sound, and scrupulously clean and dry. It 
should be gathered in the morning of a sunny day, as it will 
then possess its finest flavor. Care should be taken to re- 
move all bruised or decayed parts. Allowing them to re- 
main will darken the sirup, and consequently impair the 
beauty of the preserves. Fruit requiring to be pared should 
be laid in water to preserve the color after the paring. The 
best sugar is the cheapest ; indeed, there is no economy in 
stinting the sugar, either as to quality or proper quantity, 
for inferior sugar is wasted in scum, and the preserves will 
not keep unless a sufficient proportion of sugar is boiled 
with the fruit. At the same time, too large a proportion of 
sugar will destroy the natural flavor of the fruit, and in all 
probability make fruit candy, instead of the result sought. 

The usual proportion in making preserves, is a pound of 
sugar to a pound of fruit. There are a few fruits which 
require more sugar. In making the sirup, use a small cup- 
ful of water to a pound of fruit. The sirup should always 
be boiled and strained before putting the fruit in. 

Fruit should be cooked in brass kettles, or those of bell- 
metal. Modern kettles lined with porcelain, are much used 

207 



208 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

for this purpose. The kettle should be broad and shallow, 
so that there will be no necessity for heaping the fruit. 
Never use tin, iron, or pewter spoons, or skimmers, for pre- 
serves, as they will convert the color of red fruit into a 
dingy purple, and impart, besides, a very unpleasant flavor. 

Great care should be taken not to place the kettle flat 
upon the fire, as this will be likely to burn at the bottom. 

Glass jars are much the best for preserves, as the condi- 
tion of the fruit can be observed more readily. Whatever 
jars are used, however, the contents should be examined 
every three weeks for the first two months, and if there are 
any signs of either mold or fermentation it should be boiled 
over again. Preserves should be stored in a cool, dry place, 
but not in one into which fresh air never enters. Damp has 
a tendency to make the fruit mold, and heat to make it 
ferment. 

A jelly-bag should be in every kitchen. It should be 
made of flannel, pointed at the bottom, so that the jelly will 
run out chiefly at one point. It is a good plan to sew a 
strong loop to the top of the bag, so that it may be hung 
upon a nail near the fire, that the juice of the fruit may run 
through gradually into a vessel below. The bag should not 
be squeezed with the hands, if you wish a very clear jelly. 
After the clear juice has been obtained, the remainder may 
be pressed, to make a very excellent, but inferior article of 
jelly or marmalade. 

Rinse the tumblers or bowls to be used in cold water 
just before filling with jelly or marmalade. When the jelly 
is cold, fit a circle of tissue-paper, dip it in brandy, and 
place it directly on the surface of the fruit. This simple 
precaution will save the housekeeper much annoyance by 
protecting the conserve from mold. Should the fungus form 
inside the upper cover of the glass, the inner will effectually 
shield the contents. Paste thick paper over the top of the 
glass to exclude the air.

RECIPES. 

Cnrrant Jelly. — Never gather currants or other soft or 
small seed fruit immediately after a rain for preserving pur- 
poses, as they are greatly impoverished by the moisture 
absorbed. In this climate, the first week in July is usually 
considered the time to make currant jelly. Weigh the cur- 
rants without removing the stems ; do not wash them, but 
remove leaves and whatever may adhere to them ; to each 
pound of fruit allow half the weight of granulated or pure 
loaf sugar ; put a few currants into a porcelain-lined kettle, 
and press them with a potato-masher, or anything conven- 
ient, in order to secure sufficient liquid to prevent burning ; 
then add the remainder of the fruit and boil freely for twenty 
minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent burning ; take out 
and strain through a jelly-bag, putting the liquid into earthen 
or wooden vessels. When strained, return the liquid to the 
kettle, without the trouble of measuring, and let it boil 
thoroughly for a moment or so ; then add the sugar ; the 
moment the sugar is entirely dissolved, the jelly is done, 
and must be dished, or placed in glasses ; it will jelly upon 
the side of the cup as it is taken up, leaving no doubt as to 
the result. 

Currant Jelly, No. 2. — Take three quarts of fine, ripe, red 
currants, and four of white ; put them into a jar, tie paper 
over the top, and put them into a cool oven for three or four 
hours, or else into a pan of boiling water, or set them on 
the side of the range ; when they are thoroughly heated, 
strain through a jelly-bag. To every pint of juice, add one 
pound of granulated sugar, and boil from five to fifteen 
minutes ; turn while hot into wet tumblers. 

Currant Jelly without Cooking. — Press the juice from the 
currants and strain it ; to every pint put a pound of fine white 
sugar ; mix them together until the sugar is dissolved ; then 
14 



210 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

put it in jars ; seal them and expose them to a hot sun for 
two or three days. 

Black Currant Jelly. — Boil the currants till the juice flows, 
then strain through a jelly -bag, and set it over the fire for 
twenty minutes, after which add half a pound of sugar to a 
pound of juice, and boil for about ten minutes. 

White Currant Jelly. — Strip the fruit off the stems, and 
pound it in a clean wooden bowl. Drip the juice gently 
through a jelly-bag. Prepare a very pure, clear sirup of the 
best white sugar; allow a pint of juice to a pound of sugar; 
boil it ten minutes only. Put it in glass preserve-tumblers, 
cover with paper to fit exactly, and keep it dry and cool. 

Apple Jelly. — Take twenty large, juicy apples; pare and 
chop ; put into a jar with the rind of four large lemons," 
pared thin and cut in bits ; cover the jar closely, and set in 
a pot of boiling water ; keep water boiling all around it until 
the apples are dissolved ; strain through a jelly-bag, and 
mix with the liquid the juice of four lemons ; to one pint of 
mixed juice use one pound of sugar; put in kettle, and when 
the sugar is melted set it on the fire, and boil and skim 
about twenty minutes, or until it is a thick, fine jelly. 

Apple Jelly, No. 2. — Peel and core sour apples ; boil them 
in a very little water, and strain them through a jelly-bag. 
Measure, and allow a pound of granulated sugar to a pint 
of juice. Mix the sugar and juice well together, and let it 
boil from five to ten minutes. Put it warm into glasses ; 
cut some white paper to fit the top, dip it in brandy, and lay 
on when the jelly is cool ; paste or tie thick paper over the 
glasses, and when cold put away in a dark, dry place. 

Crab-apple Jelly. — Wash and quarter Siberian crab-apples. 
Cover with cold water and let cook until thoroughly tender. 
Strain through a jelly-bag, and to every pint of juice add 
one pound of sugar. Let cook until it will jelly A slight 
flavoring of essence of cinnamon is an improvement. 



JELLIES, JAMS, AND PRESERVES. 211 

Quince Jelly. — Take very ripe quinces ; peel and core, and 
boil in a litde water till very soft ; drain off the juice 
through a coarse towel, add an equal measure of sugar, and 
boil twenty minutes. 

Grape Jelly. — Mash the grapes thoroughly and strain 
out the juice. Add an equal measure of sugar, and boil 
twenty minutes. 

Barberry Jelly. — Pick the berries from the stalks, mash 
them, and boil fifteen minutes. Squeeze through a jelly- 
bag; allow a pound of white sugar to a pound of juice; 
melt the sugar in the juice, and boil half an hour. 

Raspberry Jelly. — Crush the raspberries and strain through 
a wet cloth. Add an equal measure of sugar, and boil from 
ten to twenty minutes. 

Apple Marmalade. — Pare, core, and slice two or three dozen 
tart, juicy apples; three-quarters of a pound of sugar to 
every pint of juice. Stew until tender in just enough cold 
water to cover them. Drain off the juice through a colan- 
der, and put into a preserving-kettle, stirring into it three- 
quarters of a pound of sugar for every pin.: of the liquid. 
Boil until it begins to jelly ; strain the juice of two lemons 
into it; put in the apples, and stew pretty fast, stirring 
almost constantly, until it becomes thick and smooth. If 
the apples are not entirely soft, rub them through the cok, 
ander before adding them to the boiling sirup. 

Quince Marmalade. — Take very ripe quinces ; wash, pare 
and core them ; to each pound of fruit allow one pound of 
loaf sugar. Boil the parings and cores together, with water 
enough to cover them, till quite soft ; strain the liquid into 
the preserving-kettle with the fruit and sugar. Boil the 
whole over a slow fire, stirring frequently until the mass be- 
comes thick. 

Pear and Quince Marmalade. — Pare and core two dozen 
juicy pears and ten fine, ripe quinces. Add three-quarters 



212 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

of a pound of sugar to every pound of fruit and the juice of 
three lemons. Throw them into cold water, and stew the 
parings and cores in a little water to make the sirup. When 
they have boiled to pieces, strain off the liquid ; when cold, 
put in the sliced fruit and bring to a fast boil. When the 
mass is thick and smooth, cook steadily for an hour or more, 
working with a wooden spoon to a rich jelly. 

Pineapple Marmalade. — Take ripe, juicy pineapples ; pare, 
cut out the specks very carefully, and grate on a coarse 
grater all but the core. Weigh, and allow a pound of sugar 
to a pound of fruit. Cook from twenty minutes to half an 
hour. 

Orange Marmalade. — Take eighteen sweet, ripe oranges, six 
pounds best white sugar. Grate the peel from four of these 
and reserve it for the marmalade. The rinds of the others 
will not be needed. Pare the fruit carefully, removing the 
inner white skin as well as the yellow. Slice the orange ; 
remove the seeds ; put the fruit and grated peel in a porce- 
lain kettle, and boil steadily until the pulp is reduced to a 
smooth mass. Take from the fire, and put through a col- 
ander. Stir in six pounds of the best-white sugar; return 
to the fire, and boil fast, stirring constantly half an hour or 
until thick. 

Grape Marmalade. — Put green grapes into a preserving-pan 
with sufficient water to cover them. Put them on the fin;, 
and boil until reduced to a mash ; put the pulp through a 
sieve which will strain out the seeds ; to each pound of pulp 
add two pounds of the best loaf sugar, and boil to the con- 
sistence of a jelly. 

Peach Marmalade. — Select peaches which are quite ripe ; 
pare and cut them in small pieces; to every pound of fruit 
add one pound of sugar ; put the fruit and sugar into a pre- 
serving-kettle, and mash well together ; place it over the fire, 
and when it begins to boil, stir until it becomes quite thick. 



JELLIES, JAMS, AND PRESERVES. 213 

Cherry Jam. — First stone and then weigh some freshly 
gathered preserving cherries; boil them over a brisk fire 
for an hour, keeping them almost constantly stirred from the 
L ottom of the pan, to which they will otherwise be liable to 
stick and burn. Add for each pound of the fruit half a 
pound of good sugar roughly powdered, and boil quickly 
for twenty minutes, taking off the scum as it rises. 

Blackberry Jam. — To four bowls of blackberries add four 
bowls of sugar ; boil until it jellies. 

Raspberry Jam. — Mash the raspberries, and allow a pound 
of sugar to a pound of fruit. Boil twenty minutes. A few 
currants added to raspberry jam is considered by many a 
great improvement. 

Barberry Jam. — The barberries should be quite ripe, though 
they should not be allowed to hang until they begin to 
decay. Strip them from the stalks, throw aside such as are 
spotted, and for each pound of fruit allow eighteen ounces of 
well-refined sugar ; boil this, with one pint of water to every 
four pounds, until it becomes white and falls in thick 
masses from the spoon ; then throw in the fruit, and keep it 
stirred over a brisk fire for six minutes only ; take off the 
6cum, and pour it into jars or glasses. 

Strawberry Jam. — Use fine, scarlet berries ; weigh and boil 
them for thirty-five minutes, keeping them constantly 
stirred ; add eight ounces of good sugar to the pound of 
fruit ; mix them well off the fire, then boil again quickly for 
twenty-five minutes. One pound of white currant juice 
added at the outset to four of the strawberries will greatly 
improve this preserve. 

White Currant Jam. — Boil together quickly for seven min- 
utes equal quantities of fine white currants, picked very care- 
fully, and of the best white sugar pounded and passed 
through a sieve. Stir the preserve gently the whole time, 



214 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

and skim it thoroughly. Just before it is taken from the 
fire, throw in the strained juice of one good lemon to four 
pounds of the fruit. 

Damson Jam. — The fruit for this jam should be freshly 
gathered and quite ripe. Split, stone, weigh, and boil it 
quickly for forty minutes ; then stir in half its weight of 
good sugar roughly powdered, and when it is dissolved, 
give the preserve fifteen minutes additional boiling, keeping 
it stirred and thoroughly skimmed. 

Green Gage Jam. — Rub ripe green gages through a sieve; put 
all the pulp into a pan with an equrl weight of loaf sugar 
pounded and sifted. Boil the whole until sufficiently thick, 
and put into glasses. 

Preserved Peaches. — Weigh the peaches, and allow three- 
quarters of a pound of sugar to every pound of fruit. Throw 
about half the sugar over the fruit, and let it stand over 
night. In the morning drain the sirup off the fruit, add the 
rest of the sugar, and let that come to a boil. Put the 
peaches in, and let them boil until you can stick a straw 
through them. In cooking the peaches, put a few at a time 
only in the sirup to cook. 

Preserved Peaches, No. 2. — Weigh the fruit after it is pared 
and the stones extracted and allow a pound of sugar to every 
pound of peaches. Put the sugar in a preserving-kettle, and 
make the sirup; let it just boil ; lay the peaches in, and let 
them boil steadily until they are tender and clear. Take 
them out with a perforated skimmer and lay upon flat 
dishes, crowding as little as possible. Boil the sirup almost 
to a jelly, until it is clear and thick, skimming off all the 
scum. Fill the jars two-thirds full of the peaches, pour on 
the boiling sirup, and, when cold, cover with brandied 
tissue-paper, then with thick paper tied tightly over them. 
Or put them in air-tight jars. 



JELLIES, JAMS, AND PRESERVES. 215 

Preserved Quinces. — Use a pound of sugar to each pound 
of quince after paring, coring, and quartering ; take half of 
the sugar and make a thin sirup ; stew in this a few of the 
quinces at a time till all are finished. Make a rich sirup of 
the remaining sugar, and pour over them. 

Pineapple Preserves. — Use pineapples as ripe as can be had. 
Pare and cut them into thin slices, weigh them, and allow 
one pound of the best granulated sugar to each pound of 
fruit. Take a deep china bowl or dish, and in it put a layer 
of fruit and sugar alternately, a coating of sugar on the top ; 
let it stand all night. In the morning, take out the fruit and 
put the sirup into a preserving-kettle. Boil and skim it until 
it is perfectly clear ; then, while it is boiling hot, pour it 
over the fruit, and let it stand uncovered until it becomes 
entirely cold. If it stands covered, the steam will fall into 
the sirup and thin it. 

Preserved Pears. — Preserved pears are put up precisely as 
are peaches, but are only pared, not cored or divided. Leave 
the stems on. 

Watermelon Rind Preserves. — Select rind which is firm, 
green, and thick ; cut in any fanciful shape, such as leaves, 
stars, diamonds, etc. Then weigh, and to each pound of 
rind allow one and a half pounds of loaf sugar. To green 
them, take a brass or copper kettle, and to a layer of grape- 
vine leaves, which should be well washed, add a layer of 
the rind, and so on until the last, which should be a thick 
layer of th2 leaves, and well covered with a coarse linen 
cloth. To each pound of the rind, add a piece of alum the 
size oi a pea ; then fill up with warm water sufficient to 
cover the whole, and let it stand upon the stove, where it 
will steam, but not boil, until the greening is completed, 
which will be in two or three hours. When green, lay them 
in clear, cold water, and make your sirup. To each pound 
of sugar add one and a half pints of water ; clarify, put in 



216 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

your rind ; slice lemons, two to each pound of rind, and 
when about half done add the lemons. Boil until the rind 
is perfectly transparent. A few pieces of ginger-root may 
be added, which will impart a high flavor, and will blend 
very delightfully with the lemons. 

Preserved Citron. — Proceed the same as above, substituting 
citron for the watermelon rind. 

Preserved Strawberries. — Procure fresh, large strawberries 
when in their prime, but not so ripe as to be very soft ; hull 
and weigh them ; take an equal weight of sugar, make a 
sirup, and when boiling hot, put in the berries. A small 
quantity only should be done at once. If crowded, they 
will become mashed. Let them boil about twenty minutes, 
or a half an hour ; turn into tumblers or small jars, and seal 
with egg papers while hot. 

Preserved Cherries. — Wash, stem, and stone the cherries ; 
save every drop of the juice, and use it in place of water in 
making the sirup. Make a sirup, allowing a pound of sugar 
to every pound of fruit ; add the fruit, and let it simmer 
gently for half an hour, skimming as is necessary. 

Damson Preserves. — To four pounds of damsons use three 
pounds of sugar ; prick each damson with a needle ; dis- 
solve the sugar with one-half pint of water, and put it on 
the fire ; when it simmers, put in as many damsons as will 
lie on the top ; when they open, take them out and lay them 
on a dish, and put others in, and so on until all have been 
in ; then put them all in the kettle together and let them 
stew until done ; put them in jars and seal them. 

Green Gage Preserves. — When the fruit is ripe, wipe them 
clean, and to one pound of fruit put one-quarter pound of 
sugar, which will make a fine sirup ; boil the fruit in this 
sirup until it is perfectly done ; then use a fresh sirup of one 
pound of fruit to one pound of sugar; moistening the sugar 



JELLIES, JAMS, AND PRESERVES. 217 

with water. When the sirup boils put in the fruit, and leave 
for fifteen minutes ; then put the fruit in jars ; boil the sirup 
until thick ; when cooled to milkwarm, pour it over the 
fruit ; tie the jars tightly and keep in a warm place. 

Strawberries in Wine. — Put a quantity of the finest large 
strawberries in a bottle, strew in a few spoonfuls of pow- 
dered sugar, and fill the bottle up with Madeira or Sherry 
wine. 

Grapes in Brandy. — Take some close bunches of grapes, 
white or black, not overripe, and lay them in a jar. Put a 
good quantity of pounded white candy upon them, and fill 
up the jar with brandy. Tie them close down, and keep in 
a dry place. Prick each grape with a needle three times. 

Brandy Peaches. — Take large, juicy freestone peaches, not 
so ripe as to burst or mash on being handled. Rub the 
down from them with a clean thick flannel. Prick every 
peach down to the stone with a large silver fork, and score 
them all along the seam or cleft. To each pound of peaches 
allow a pound of granulated sugar and half a pint of water 
mixed with half a white of egg, slightly beaten. Put the 
sugar into a porcelain kettle and pour the water upon it. 
When it is quite melted, give it a stirring, set it over the 
fire,, and boil and skim it till no more scum rises. Then 
put in the peaches, and let them cook (uncovered) in the 
sirup till a straw will penetrate them. Then take the kettle 
off the fire, and take out the fruit with a wooden spoon, 
draining it over the kettle. Let the sirup remain in the ket* 
tie a little longer. Mix a pint of the very best white brandy 
for each pound of peaches, with the sirup, and boil them 
together ten minutes or more. Transfer the peaches to 
large glass jars, making each about two-thirds full, and 
pour the brandy and sirup over them, filling the jars full. 
When cool, cover closely. 

Spiced Peaches. — Seven pounds of fruit, one pint vinegar, 



218 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

three pounds sugar, two ounces cinnamon, one-half ounce 
cloves. Scald together the sugar, vinegar, and spices ; pour 
over the fruit. Let it stand twenty-four hours ; drain off, 
scald again, and pour over fruit, letting it stand another 
twenty-four hours. Boil all together until the fruit is tender. 
Skim it out, and boil the liquor until thickened. Pour over 
the fruit and set away in a jar. 

Apple Butter. — Boil down a kettieful of cider to two- 
thirds the original quantity. Pare, core, and slice juicy 
apples, and put as many into the cider as it v/ill cover. Boil 
slowly, stirring often with a flat stick, and when the apples 
are tender to breaking, take them out with a perforated 
skimmer, draining well against the sides of the- kettle. Put 
in a second supply of apples and stew them soft, as many 
as the cider will hold. Take from the fire, pour all together 
into a tub or large crock; cover and let it stand twelve 
hours. Then return to the kettle and boil down, stirring all 
the while until it is the consistency of thick custard and 
brown in color. Spice well with D. & L. SladeCo.'sPure 
Spices. 

Peach Butter. — To one bushel of peaches allow from eight 
to ten pounds of granulated sugar; pare and halve the 
peaches, put into the kettle, and stir constantly, to prevent 
sticking to the kettle, until perfectly smooth and rather 
thick ; a part of the peach-stones thrown in and cooked 
with the peaches give it a nice flavor, and they can be after- 
ward skimmed out ; add the sugar a short time before tak- 
ing from the fire ; put in jars and cover tight ; peaches for 
butter should be neither too mealy nor too juicy.

XVI.— CANNED FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. 

widespread use of canned goods; philosophy of canning 
fruits; how to fill the jars ; what jars are best ; selec- 
tion OF THE FRUIT ; WHERE TO STORE THE CANS ; NEED OF 
WATCHING THE CANS. TWELVE RECIPES OF CANNING FRUIT 
AND VEGETABLES. 

CANNED fruits and vegetables of all kinds may now be 
found abundantly in the stores. Their prices are so 
low that they present a strong inducement to the 
housekeeper to omit the labor incident to home canning, and 
simply to purchase what is needed. 

What is aimed at in all these processes is the entire ex- 
clusion of air from the fruit. Its expulsion from them is 
effected by using heat enough to cook them, after which the 
hermetical sealing does the remaining service. Solder, wax, 
and rubber bands do this sealing work. 

If it is desired to preserve the fruit whole, it may be put 
into the j'ars before heating. Fill the jars with water, and 
set them into a wash-boiler of cold water, the water reach- 
ing three-fourths of the way to the tops of the jars. Do not 
set them directly on the bottom, but on a little hay, lest the 
heat cause them to crack. Bring the water slowly to a boil, 
and let it boil about five minutes. The cans may then be 
taken out, stirred lightly, or shaken, to expel any remaining 
air bubbles ;. then fill to the brim with boiling water and 
close the jars. No air bubbles should remain in the can. 
If the fruit can be cooked before canning, the process is 
much simpler, as the boiling material itself expels the air. 
The cans in this case need simply to be filled and then 
sealed.

RECIPES. 



Canned Strawberries. — Fill glass jars with fresh strawberries 
sprinkled with sugar, allowing a little over one-quarter of "a 
pound of sugar to each pound of berries ; set the jars in a 
boiler, with a little hay laid in the bottom to prevent the 
jars from breaking ; fill with cold water to within an inch or 
two of the tops of the jars ; let them boil fifteen minutes, then 
move back to the boiler, wrap the hand in a towel, and take 
out the jars ; fill the jars to the top before sealing, using one 
or more of the filled jars for that purpose if necessary. 

Canned Gooseberries. — Fill very clean, dry, wide-necked 
bottles with gooseberries gathered the same day and before 
they have attained their full growth. Cork them tightly, 
wrap a little hay round each of them, and set them up to 
their necks in a kettle of cold water, which should be 
brought very gradually to boil. Let the fruit be gently 
simmered until it appears shrunken and perfectly scalded ; 
then take out the bottles, and with the contents of one or 
two fill up the remainder. Use great care not to break the 
fruit in doing this. When all are ready, pour scalding 
water into the bottles and cover the gooseberries entirely 
with it, or they will become moldy at the top. Cork the 
bottles well immediately, and cover the necks with melted 
resin ; keep them in a cool place ; and when they are used 
pour off the greater part of the water and add sugar as for 
the fresh fruit. 

Canned Peaches. — Peel and quarter choice peaches. To 
peel, place them in a wire basket, dip into boiling water a 
moment and then into cold water, and strip off the skins. 
Have a porcelain-kettle with boiling water and another with 
sirup made with granulated sugar ; drop the peaches into 
boiling water (some previously boil the pits in the water for 
their flavor) and let them cook until tender; then lift them 
out carefully into a can, pouring over them all the sirup the 



CANNED FRUITS, ETC. 221 

can will hold, and seal immediately. Cook only peaches 
enough to fill one can at a time. 

Canned Peaches, No. 2. — Pare and stone peaches enough for 
two jars at a time. If many are pared, they will become dark 
colored by standing. Rinse in cold water ; then cook in a 
rich sirup of sugar and water about fifteen or twenty minutes, 
or until they are clear. Put into jars all that are not broken; 
fill up with the hot sirup, about as thick as ordinary mo- 
lasses, and seal. The same sirup will do to cook several jars. 
After the sirup becomes dark, it, with the broken peaches, 
can be used for marmalade or peach butter. The same 
method can be used for pears, plums, and all light fruits. 

Canned Pineapple. — Use three-fourths of a pound of sugar 
to one pound of fruit. Pick the pineapple to pieces with a 
silver fork. Scald and can while hot. 

Canned Grapes. — Squeeze the pulp from the skin ; boil the 
pulp until the seeds begin to loosen, having the skins boiling 
hard and separately in a little water. When the pulp seems 
tender, put it through the sieve ; then add the skins, if ten- 
der, with the water they boil in, if not too much. Use a 
large coffeecupful of sugar for a quart can ; boil until thick, 
and can in the usual way. 

Canned Plums. — Prick each plum with a needle to prevent 
bursting; prepare a sirup,i allowing a gill of pure water and 
a quarter of a pound of sugar to every three quarts of fruit. 
When the sugar is dissolved and the water blood-warm, put 
in the plums. Heat slowly to a boil. Let them boil five 
minutes — not fast or they will break badly — fill up the jars 
with plums, pour in the scalding sirup until it runs down 
the sides, and seal. Green gages are very fine put up in this 
way, also damsons for pies. 

Canned Pears. — Select finely flavored fruit ; either halve and 
core them or core whole ; make a sirup of sugar and water, 



222 THE HOUSEWIFE S LIBRARY. 

using as little water as will dissolve the sugar. Add a 
quarter of a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit. Place the 
fruit in the kettle carefully, and let it come to a boil or until 
the fruit is well scalded. Turn into the jars hot, and seal at 
once. 

Canned Tomatoes. — Pour boiling water over the tomatoes 
to loosen the skins. Remove these ; drain off all the juice 
that will come away without pressing hard ; put them into a 
kettle and heat slowly to a boil. The tomatoes will look 
much nicer if all the hard parts be removed before putting 
them on the fire. Rub the pulp soft with your hands. Boil 
half an hour ; dip out the surplus liquid, pour the tomatoes, 
boiling hot, into the cans, and seal. Keep in a cool, dark 
place. 

Canned Beans. — Remove the strings at the sides, and cut 
into pieces about an inch long ; put them into boiling water 
and scald, then can them. 

Canned Asparagus. — Cut away all the hard part of the stem 
and boil the top portion until nearly done, just as if about 
to serve at once. Flat cans are best, into which the stems 
can be laid regularly, the water in which they were boiled 
being poured over them boiling hot, and the can sealed. If 
jars or high cans are used, pack the .asparagus into them 
until they are full. Fill the cans with water ; set them on 
hay in a boiler of cold water reaching to within an inch of 
their tops ; then bring to a boil and nearly finish cooking 
the stems. Wrap the hand in a towel ; take out the cans 
and seal or solder them as in other vegetables. 

Canned Corn. — Boil sweet corn till nearly done ; cut close 
from the cobs and fill the jars ; pour on water in which the 
corn was boiled ; place in a boiler and just bring to a boil, 
as above - then take out and seal.

XVII.— PICKLES AND CATSUPS. 

PICKLES MORE POPULAR THAN WHOLESOME ; GREENING PICKLES J 
WHAT KETTLES AND JARS SHOULD NOT BE USED IN PICKLING J 
CHOOSING THE FRUIT, SPICES, ETC. ; HOW TO KEEP PICKLES ; 
CATSUPS, HOW MADE, ETC. THIRTY-THREE RECIPES FOR PICKLES 
AND CATSUPS. 

PICKLES are very popular as a relish, but it must be 
confessed that they are not the most wholesome diet. 
This is due chiefly to the fact that they are made of 
hard, crude, and often of unripe fruit. Then, too, the ex- 
cess of acid and the high seasoning disagree with many 
constitutions. 

It is deemed important that pickles for the market be 
well greened. To accomplish this end, copperas and other 
chemicals are employed or copper kettles are used. All 
this is poisonous, and should be shunned. No metal ket- 
tles or spoons should be tolerated in pickling. Glazed jars 
are not desirable either, as salt and vinegar decompose the 
glazing and set free the lead which it contains. An ordinary 
stone jar is the vessel to use, or a porcelain-lined kettle. 

Be careful to select perfectly sound fruit or vegetables for 
pickling, and use none but the very best cider vinegar. 
Good white wine vinegar does well for some sorts of pickles, 
but be ever watchful against chemical preparations called 
vinegar, that destroy instead of preserving the articles put 
away in them. In the selection of spices there is so much 
diversity of taste that no general directions will be of prac- 
tical value. But get the purest articles you can find. 

Pickles must be kept from the air. It is a good plan to 



224 THE HOUSE WIFE'S LIBRAR Y. 

put them up in large jars, and for use to empty the large, 
jar at once into smaller ones, using these one at a time. 
Keep them wholly covered with the vinegar. Water will 
soon cause the jar of pickles to spoil. 

The same hints given above apply to the making of cat- 
sup, which is really but a pickle cooked to a more advanced 
point. It needs to be tightly corked and sealed, that it may 
keep well. 

RECIPES. 

Cucumber Pickles. — Make a weak brine, hot or cold ; if hot, 
let the cucumbers stand in it twenty-four hours ; if cold, 
forty-eight hours ; rinse and dry the cucumbers with a cloth, 
take vinegar enough to cover them, allow one ounce of 
alum to every gallon of vinegar, put it in a brass kettle (or 
porcelain-lined, if the greening is not desired) with the 
cucumbers, and heat slowly, turning the cucumbers from 
the bottom frequently ; as soon as they are heated through, 
skim them out into a crock, let the vinegar boil up, turn it 
over the pickles, and let them stand at least twenty-four 
houis; drain off the vinegar. Take fresh vinegar, and to 
every gallon allow two tablespoofuls of white mustard-seed, 
one of cloves, one of celery-seed, one of stick cinnamon, 
one large, green pepper, a very little horse-radish, and, if 
you like, one-half pint of sugar. Divide the spices equally 
into several small bags of coarse muslin, scald with the vine- 
gar, and pour over the pickles. If you like your pickles 
hard, let the vinegar cool before pouring over them. 

Cucumber Pickles, No. 2. — To a gallon of water add a quart 
of salt, put in the cucumbers, and let them stand over night. 
In the morning, wash them out of the brine, and put them 
carefully into a stone jar. Boil a gallon of vinegar, put in, 
while cold, quarter of a pound of cloves, and a tablespoon- 
ful of alum ; when it boils hard, skim it well and turn over 
the cucumbers. In a week they will be fit for use.

PICKLES AND CATSUPS. 225 

Pickled Carrot. — Boil carrots until tender, cut into 
fancy shapes, and put them into strong vinegar. Spice 
or flavor to suit taste. This is a pretty garnish and an 
excellent pickle. 

Pickled Barberries. — Soak nice large bunches of bar- 
berries in salt and water for a few hours. Remove 
from the water and pour scalding vinegar over them. 
Spice the vinegar if you prefer. These are ornamental 
for salad-garnishing. They may be kept in the brine 
and freshened when used. — The Peerless Cook 
Book : Mrs. D.A.Lincoln. Redding & Co., Publishers. 

Pickled Pears. — Take half a peck of pears halved and 
cored, lay the pieces together, and pack them all closely 
together in a preserving-kettle. Add two ounces of cin- 
namon-bark and half an ounce of cloves, two pounds of 
sugar, and one pint of vinegar ; cover them up and set 
on a slow fire to boil. Boil down until thoroughly 
cooked. Put in a stone jar and cover with white paper 
wet with brandy. 

Pickled Muskmelon. — Take a ripe melon (cantaloupe), 
peel, and cut in blocks. Then take two tablespoonfuls 
of pulverized alum dissolved in hot water, pour over and 
add cold water until they are covered. (Press them 
down with a plate.) Let them stand over night, then 
drain off, and rinse well with cold water. Take a quart 
of vinegar and two pounds of sugar, boil and turn over. 
Do this for nine mornings, adding the vinegar and sugar 
if necessary. The ninth morning tie up in a thin muslin 
bag an ounce of cloves and two ounces of cinnamon- 
bark, boil in vinegar, then add your melon and boil for 
a short time. In putting the pickle away in a jar, place 
the muslin bag containing the spices among them on the 
top. 



226 THE HO USE WIFE'S LIBRAR Y. 

Pickled Onions. — Select small white onions, put them over 
the fire in cold water with a handful of salt. When the 
water becomes scalding hot, take them out and peel off the 
skins, lay them in a cloth to dry ; then put them in a jar. 
Boil half an ounce of allspice artd half an ounce of cloves 
in a quart of vinegar. Take out the sp'ce and pour the 
vinegar over the onions while it is hot. Tie up the jar when 
)he vinegar is cold, and keep it in a dry place. 

Pickled Onions, No. 2. — Take small, white onions and peel 
them ; lay them in salt water for two days ; change the water 
once; then drain and put them in bottles. Take vinegar 
enough to cover them, spice with whole mixed spices, scald 
it, and pour over the onions. 

Pickled Garlic and Eschalots. — Garlic and eschalots may h« 
pickled in the same way as onions. 

Pickled Nasturtiums. — Nasturtiums should be gathered 
quite young, and a portion of the buds, when very small, 
should be mixed with them. Prepare a pickle by dissolv- 
ing an ounce and a half of salt in a quart of pale vinegar, 
and throw in the berries as they become fit, from day to 
day. They are used instead of capers for sauce, and by 
some persons are preferred to them. When purchased for 
pickling, put them at once into a jar and cover them well 
with the vinegar. 

Pickled Watermelon.-— Take the outer part of the rind of 
the melon, pare and cut in small pieces. To one quart of 
vinegar add two pounds of sugar, one ounce of cassia buds, 
m this boil the rind until clear and tender. 

Pickled Walnuts. — Walnuts for this pickle must be gathered 
while a pin can pierce them easily. When once the shell 
can be felt, they have ceased to be in a proper state for it. 
Make sufficient brine to cover them well, with six ounces of 
salt to the gallon of water ; take off the scum, which will 



PICKLES AND CATSUPS. 227 

rise to the surface as the salt dissolves, throw in the walnuts, 
and stir them night and morning ; change the brine every 
three days, and if they are wanted for immediate eating, 
leave them in it for twelve days; otherwise, drain them 
from it in nine, spread them on dishes, and let them remain 
exposed to the air until they become black ; this will be in 
twelve hours, or less. Make a pickle for them with some- 
thing more than half a gallon of vinegar to the hundred, a 
teaspoonful of salt, two ounces of black pepper, three of 
bruised ginger, a drachm of mace, and from a quarter to 
half an ounce of cloves (of which some may be stuck into 
three or four small onions), and four ounces of mustard- 
seed. Boil the whole of these together for about five min- 
utes ; have the walnuts ready in a stone jar, or jars, and 
pour the vinegar on them as soon as it is taken from the fire. 
Whfin the pickle is quite cold, cover the jar securely and 
store it in a dry place. Keep the walnuts always well 
covered with vinegar, and boil that which is added to them. 

Pickled Red Cabbage. — Slice the red cabbage into a colan- 
der, and sprinkle each layer with salt ; let it drain two days, 
then put it into a jar and pour boiling vinegar enough to 
cover, and put in a few slices of red beet-root. Use the 
purple red cabbage. Cauliflower cut in bunches, and 
thrown in after being salted, will take on the color of a 
beautiful red. 

Pickled Mushrooms. — Rub the mushroom heads with flan- 
nel and salt, throw them in a stewpan with a little salt over 
them ; sprinkle with pepper and a small quantity of mace ; 
as the liquor comes out, shake them well, and keep them 
over a gentle fire until all the liquor is dried into them 
again ; then put as much vinegar into the pan as will cover 
them ; give it a scald, and pour the whole into bottles. 

Pickled Beets.— Wash the beet perfectly, not cutting any 
of the fibrous roots, lest the juice escape ; put in sufficient 



228 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

water to boil it, and when the skin will come off easily it is 
sufficiently cooked, and may be taken out and laid upon a 
cloth to cool. Having rubbed off the peel, cut the beet 
into thick slices, pour over it cold vinegar prepared as fol- 
lows : Boil a quart of vinegar with an ounce of whole black 
pepper and an equal weight of dry ginger, and let it stand 
until quite cold. Keep closely corked. 

Pickled Peppers. — Do not pick them till just as they begin 
to turn red ; then soak them for ten or twelve days in strong 
salt and water ; take them from the brine and soak them 
in clear water for a day. Wipe them dry, and put them 
away in cold vinegar ; or if you wish them milder, remove 
the seeds and scald the vinegar, but do not boil. 

Pickled Bell Peppers. — Cut a slit in the side of each pepper 
and take out all the seeds. Let them soak in brine (strong 
enough to float an egg) two days. Then, washing them in 
cold water, put them into a stonejar. Pour over them vine- 
gar boiled with cinnamon, mace, and nutmeg. Whenever 
they are wanted to be served, stuff each one with a boiled 
tongue cut into dice and mixed with a mayonnaise dressing. 
Or little mangoes may be made, stuffing each one with 
pickled nasturtiums, grapes, minced onions, red cabbage, or 
cucumbers, seasoned with mustard-seed, root ginger, and 
mace. 

Pepper-hash. — Take four dozen peppers, two very large 
cabbages, one ounce of light mustard-seed. Chop the 
peppers fine, cut the cabbage on a cabbage-knife, mix to- 
gether, salt well, and let it stand over night, putting the 
dish or tub so the juice will run down ; pour off in the 
morning. Add one ounce of cloves, one ounce of allspice ; 
mix all through, and put the vinegar on cold. 

Flint Pickles. — Make a brine of a gallon of water and a 
cupful of salt. This must be poured boiling hot on the cu- 
cumbers six days in succession. Rinse them in cold water; 



PICKLES AND CATSUPS. 229 

put them in a kettle with a teaspoonful of allspice and a tea- 
spoonful of cloves, a handful of cinnamon sticks, a little 
sliced horse-radish, and cider vinegar to cover them. Let 
them come to a boil, then take out and put in jars. 

East India Pickle. — One hundred cucumbers (large and 
small), one peck of green tomatoes, one-half peck of onions, 
four cauliflowers, four red peppers (without the seeds), four 
heads of celery, one pint of bottled horse-radish. Slice all, 
and stand in salt twenty-four hours, then drain ; pour on 
weak vinegar ; stand on stove until it comes to a boil ; then 
drain again. Take one ounce of ground cinnamon, one 
ounce of ground tumeric, one-half pound of mustard, one- 
quarter pound of brown sugar,- wet these with cold vinegar; 
add to this sufficient vinegar to moisten all the pickles. 
Cook all together ten minutes. Seal in bottles while hot 

French Pickle. — Take one peck of green tomatoes, sliced ; 
six large onions. Throw on them a teacupful of salt over night. 
Drain thoroughly, then boil in two quarts of water and one 
quart of vinegar fifteen or twenty minutes ; drain in colan- 
der ; then take four quarts of vinegar, two pounds of brown 
sugar, one-half pound of white mustard-seed, two table- 
spoonfuls of cloves, two tablespoonfuls of cinnamon, two 
tablespoonfuls of ginger, two tablespoonfuls of ground 
mustard, one teaspoonful of cayenne pepper; put all to- 
gether and cook fifteen minutes. 

PiccaUily. — One peck of green tomatoes sliced, one-hall 
peck of onions sliced, one cauliflower, one peck of small cu- 
cumbers. Leave in salt and water twenty-four hours ; then 
put in a kettle with a handful of scraped horse-radish, one 
ounce of tumeric, one ounce of whole cloves, one-quarter 
pound of whole pepper, one ounce of cassia buds or cinna- 
mon, one pound of white mustard-seed, one pound of Eng- 
lish mustard. Put in kettle in layers, and cover with cold 
vinegar. Boil fifteen minutes, constantly stirring. 



230 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Chow-chow. — One quart of large cucumbers, one quart of 
small ones ; two quarts of onions, four heads of cauliflower, 
six green peppers, one quart of green tomatoes, one gallon 
of vinegar, one pound of mustard,, two cupfuls of sugar, two 
cupfuls of flour, one ounce of tumeric. Put all in salt and 
water one night ; cook all the vegetables in brine until 
tender except the large cucumbers. Pour vinegar and 
spices over all. 

Sweet Pickles. — Such fruit as peaches, plums, cherries, 
grapes, etc., are very palatable when sweet pickled. The 
process is the same as for other light pickles, except that 
the vinegar is sweetened to taste. 

Sweet Tomato Pickles. — Eight pounds of peeled tomatoes, 
four of powdered sugar. Of cinnamon, cloves, and albpice, 
each one ounce. Boil one hour, and add a quart of boiling 
vinegar. 

Tomato Catsup. — Take one bushel of tomatoes ; boil soft, 
and pass through a sieve. Add half a gallon of cider vinegar, 
one pint of salt, two ounces of cloves, a quarter pound of 
allspice, a half ounce of cayenne pepper. Boil until 
reduced to half the quantity. When cool, bottle and cork 
tightly. 

Tomato Catsup, No. 2. — Take one peck of ripe tomatoes, cut 
up, boil tender, and strain through a wire sieve ; add one 
large tablespoonful of ground cloves, one large tablespoon- 
ful of allspice, one large tablespoonful of cinnamon, one tea- 
spoonful of cayenne pepper, one-quarter pound of salt, one- 
quarter pound of mustard, one pint of vinegar. Boil gently 
three hours. Bottle and seal while warm. 

Green Tomato Catsup. — One peck of green tomatoes, one 
dozen large onions, one-half pint of salt ; slice the tomatoes 
and onions. To a layer of these add a layer of salt ; let 
=>tand twenty-four hours, then drain. Add one-quarter pouud 



PICKLES AND CATSUPS. 231 

of mustard-seed, three dessertspoonfuls of sweet oil, one 
ounce of allspice, one ounce of cloves, one ounce of ground 
mustard, one ounce of ground ginger, two tablespoonfuls of 
black pepper, two teaspoonfuls of celery-seed, one-quarter 
pound of brown sugar. Put all into a preserving-pan, cover 
with vinegar, and boil two hours. 

Chili Sauce. — Thirty tomatoes, three large onions, three 
peppers, one tablespoonful each of allspice, cloves, and cin- 
namon, two nutmegs,, two tablespoonfuls of salt, one quart of 
vinegar, one cupful of sugar. Chop the onions and pep- 
pers very fine. Cook the tomatoes somewhat first. Mix 
thoroughly. 

Tomato Soy. — One-half bushel of green tomatoes, three 
onions, three green peppers, one-quarter pound of mustard- 
seed, three cupfuls of suga>-, three cabbages. Chop the 
tomatoes and onions together fine; add" to one gallon of the 
tomatoes one cupful of salt ; let stand twenty-four hours, 
drain, and add the peppers (chopped fine), mustard- seed, 
sugar, and other spices to taste. Moisten all with vinegar 
and cook until tender. Before bottling, add the cabbages 
(chopped), and one cupful of chopped horse-radish. 

Grape Catsup. — Take five pints of grapes; simmer until 
soft, then put through a colander ; add to them two pints of 
brown sugar, one pint of vinegar, two tablespoonfuls of all- 
spice, two tablespoonfuls of cinnamon, two tablespoonfuls of 
cloves, one and one-half teaspoonfuls of mace, one teaspoon- 
ful of salt, one and one-half teaspoonfuls of red pepper. Boil 
till thick ; then bottle and seal tightly. 

Walnut Catsup. — The vinegar in which walnuts have been 
pickled, when they have remained in it a year, will generally 
answer all the purposes for which this catsup is required, 
particularly if it be drained from them and boiled for a few 
minutes, with a little additional spice and a few eschalots-, 
but where the vinegar is objected to, it may be made by 



232 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

boiling either the expressed juice of young walnuts for an 
hour, with six ounces of fine anchovies, four ounces of 
eschalots, half an ounce of black pepper, a quarter ounce of 
cloves, and a drachm of mace to every quart. 

Walnut Catsup, No. 2. — Pound in a mortar a hundred young 
walnuts, strewing among them as they are done half a 
pound of salt ; then pour to them a quart of strong vinegar 
and let them stand until they have become quite black, 
keeping them stirred three or four times a day ; next add a 
quart of strong, old beer, and boil the whole together for ten 
minutes ; strain it, and let it remain until the next day ; then 
pour it off clear from the sediment, add to it one large head 
of garlic bruised, half an ounce of nutmegs bruised, the same 
quantity of cloves and black pepper, and two drachms of 
mace ; boil these together for half an hour, and the follow- 
ing day bottle and cork the catsup well. 

A bottle of port wine may be added before bottling, if de- 
sired, and a large bunch of sweet herbs. 

Oyster Catsup. — Take fine, large fresh oysters, opened care- 
fully, and wash them in their own liquor. To take any par- 
ticle of shell that may remain, strain the liquor after. Pound 
the oysters in a mortar, add the liquor, and to every pint 
put a pint of sherry ; boil it up and skim ; then add two 
anchovies, pounded, an ounce of common salt, two drachms 
of pounded mace, and one of cayenne. Let it boil up, then 
skim, and rub it through a sieve. Botde when cold and 
seal it. What remains in the sieve will do for oyster sauce.

XVIII. — BEVERAGES. 

USE GOOD MATERIALS; TEA ITS VALUE AS A BEVERAGE; 

COFFEE HOW TO GET IT PURE ; HOW TO RETAIN ITS 

FLAVOR; THE COFFEE-POT; CHOCOLATE AND ITS PREPARA- 
TION ; OTHER BEVERAGES. 

WHAT is worth doing at all in culinary lines is 
worth doing well, and beverages, being in the 
line of luxuries, should be good, if not posi- 
tively luxuriant. Employ good materials, and do not 
stint them in quantity, if you want good results. 

Tea is the leaf of the tea-tree cured in various ways, 
and the difference between good tea and poor tea is due 
mainly to methods of picking and curing the leaf. 

The housekeeper has no means of knowing the qual- 
ity of the tea she buys until it is ready for drinking, 
and the dealer has usually no means of knowing the 
manner in which the tea he sells is picked and cured. 

Of the hundred million pounds of tea sent to this 
country each year, fully three-quarters is of low grade. 
It is probable that it requires twenty times as many days' 
labor to produce a given quantity of choice tea as it does 
to produce the same amount of the lower grades. 

In order to be sure of securing choice tea, the house- 
keeper should buy for her supplies goods sold by deal- 
ers who are in a position to know all about the tea sold, 
from the time it is picked. 

The old-established Oriental Tea Company still dis- 
tributes, in the writer's opinion, the most satisfactory 
brands, notwithstanding the extensive advertising in- 
iulged in by some of the newer tea-houses. 



234 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

The nutritive value of tea is not appreciable, but as an 
excitant of respiratory action and promoter of digestion it 
is very valuable. Tea should be kept closely covered in 
air-tight canisters, in order that the flavor may be retained. 

Coffee will grow in any climate where the temperature 
does not fall below fifty-five degrees. The best brands 
are obtained, however, when regard is had for climate 
and soil ; when skill is used in gathering and curing ; 
and when the preparation for and roasting of the coffee 
has been under the direction of trained and experienced 
experts. But a few years ago the securing of good cof- 
fee was a matter of chance. To-day there are several 
good brands on the market; but the writer has found 
Spurr's Revere Coffee to be by far the most satisfactory. 

Coffee should be kept in tight canisters or boxes. 
The coffee-pot must be scalded clean and occasionally 
with soda, so that the inside may be absolutely pure. 

Chocolate should never be made except it is intended 
to be used immediately. By allowing it to become cold 
or by boiling it again, the flavor is injured, the oily par- 
ticles of the cocoa are separated and rise to the surface 
also, and they will never blend pleasantly again. 

RECIPES. 

Tea. — Tea is best made in an earthenware tea-pot, 
and should never be made in a vessel made of tin. Use 
boiling water, but do not boil the tea. Allow one tea- 
spoonful for each person. Use the Oriental Tea Com- 
pany's teas — Garden Formosa, first picking, uncolored 
Japan tea, or for afternoon teas use Scented Orange 
Pekoe and Garden Flowery Pekoe. 

Teed Tea. — Iced tea should be made several hours before 
it is needed and set on ice. When ready to use it, sweet- 
en and drink without milk or cream. Use cracked ice 



BEVERAGES. 235 

to put into the glass. The tea must be extra strong, and 
do not stint the ice. 

Tea a la Rnsse. — Slice fresh, juicy lemons ; pare care- 
fully, lay a piece in the bottom of each cup ; sprinkle with 
white sugar and pour tea, very hot and strong, over them. 

Iced Tea a la Russe. — To each goblet of cold tea (with- 
out cream) add the juice of half a lemon. Fill up with 
pounded ice and sweeten well. A glass of champagne 
added to this makes what is called Russian punch. 

Coffee. — To make choicest coffee, take Spurr's Revere 
Coffee ground to about the fineness of granulated sugar, 
and use one ounce or one tablespoonful to a pint of water. 
Mix one egg with the ground coffee and put into the cof- 
fee pot. Pour the water, which should be boiling hot, on 
it ; allow it to boil for one minute. Then pour in a very 
little cold water which will settle the grounds and clarify 
the liquid. Serve at once if you would have it at its best. 

The above applies when using an ordinary coffee pot. 
When using a percolating coffee pot, like the Gem coffee 
pot, the coffee should be ground very fine, the boiling 
hot water should be poured over it, and then poured from 
the spout into a hot pitcher, or other vessel, to be again 
poured over the coffee. This should be repeated two or 
three times in order to get the full strength of the coffee. 

Stronger or weaker coffee can be prepared by using 
more or less water but the proportions given here will 
prove most satisfactory. 

Whatever process you use always thoroughly cleanse 
the coffee pot after each service. 

Meringued Coffee. — For six cupf uls of coffee take about 
one cupful of sweet cream, whipped light, with a little 
sugar. Put into each cup the desired amount of sugar 
and about a tablespoonful of boiling milk. Pour the 



236 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

coffee over these, and lay upon the surface of the hot 
liquid a large spoonful of the frothed cream. Give a 
gentle stir to each cup before sending it from the tray. 

Frothed Cafe au Lait. — Pour into the table urn one quart 
of strong, clear coffee, strained through muslin, and one 
quart boiling milk, alternating them and stirring gently. 
Cover and wrap a thick cloth about the urn for five min- 
utes before it goes to table. Have ready in a cream- 
pitcher the whites of three eggs, beaten stiff, and one 
tablespoonful of powdered sugar, whipped with them. 
Put large spoonful of this froth upon each cupful of cof- 
fee as you pour it out, heaping it slightly in the centre. 

Chocolate. — Scrape fine one square of a cake of Bens= 
dorp's Chocolate ; add equal weight of sugar ; put these 
into a pint of boiling milk and water, each one-half, and 
stir well for two or three minutes until the sugar and 
chocolate are well dissolved. This preparation may be 
improved by adding a well-beaten egg or two and stirring 
briskly through the mixture with an egg-beater. A tea- 
spoonful of Metcalf 's Water White Vanilla extract, added 
just before sending to table, is a valuable addition. 

Frothed Chocolate. — One cupful boiling water; three 
pints fresh milk ; three tablespoonfuls Bensdorp's Choco- 
late, grated ; five eggs, whites only, beaten light, and 
two tablespoonfuls powdered sugar for froth. Sweeten 
chocolate to taste ; heat milk to scalding ; wet up choco- 
late with boiling water, and when milk is hot, stir this 
into it ; simmer gently ten minutes, stirring frequently ; 
boil up briskly once ; take from fire ; sweeten to taste, 
taking care not to make it too sweet; and stir in whites 
of two eggs, whipped stiff, without sugar; pour into the 
chocolate-pot or pitcher, which should be well heated. 
Have ready in a cream-pitcher the remaining whites, 



BEVERAGES. 237 

whipped up with the powdered sugar ; cover the surface 
of each cup with the sweetened meringue before dis- 
tributing to the guests. 

Breakfast Cocoa. — Into a breakfast cup put one-half a 
teaspoonful of Bensdorp's Royal Dutch Cocoa, add a table- 
spoonful of boiling water, and mix thoroughly. Then add 
equal parts of boiling water and boiled milk, and sugar 
to the taste. Boiling two or three minutes will im- 
prove it. 

Luncheon Cocoa. — Put one-half teaspoonful Bensdorp's 
Royal Dutch Cocoa into a cup, and a teaspoonful of sugar. 
Mix both well, pour one-half cup of boiling water, while 
stirring it add one-half cup of hot milk, and the Cocoa 
is ready. The Cocoa is much improved by boiling one 
minute. — Mrs. D. A. Lincoln. 

Grape Punch. — Take one pint of grape juice and the 
juice of six lemons, one pound of granulated sugar and 
two quarts of water. Mix and serve from a punch bowl. 
An orange or pineapple may be sliced in if desired. 

Lemonade. — Squeeze the juice of lemons, and add sugar 
and ice-water to taste. 

Concentrated Lemonade. — Make a rich sirup of two and a 
half pounds of sugar and one pint of cold water and boil 
gradually. Pour it hot on one and a half ounces of citric 
acid. Bottle tight while hot. One tablespoonful will make 
a tumblerful of lemonade. 

Portable Lemonade. — Mix a quarter pound of white sugar 
with the grated rind of a large, juicy lemon. Pour upon 
this the strained juice of the lemon and pack in a jar. One 
tablespoonful will suffice for a glass of water. 

Egg Nog. — To the yelks of six eggs, add six tablespoon- 
fuls of powdered sugar, one quart of new milk, a half pint 



238 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

of French brandy, and one pint of Madeira wine. Beat the 
whites up separately, and stir them through the mixture just 
before pouring into glasses for use. 

Roman Punch. — Beat stiff the whites of three eggs.'with a 
half pound of powdered sugar. Add three teacupfuls of 
strong, sweet lemonade, one wineglassful each of rum and 
champagne, and the juice of two oranges. Ice abundantly, 
or freeze. 

Milk Punch. — Boil one quart of milk, warm from the cow. 
Beat up the yelks of four eggs and four tablespoonfuls of 
powdered sugar together; add two glasses of the best 
sheny wine ; pour into a pitcher, and mix with it the boil- 
ing milk, stirring all the time. Pour from one vessel to 
another six times ; add cinnamon and nutmeg to taste, and 
serve as soon as it can be swallowed without scalding the 
throat. 

Currant and Raspberry Shrub. — Pound four quarts of ripe 
currants and three quarts of red raspberries in a stone jar or 
wide-mouthed crock with a wooden beetle. Squeeze out 
every drop of the juice; put this into a porcelain, enamel, 
or very jlean bell-metal kettle, and boil hard ten minutes. 
Put in four pounds of loaf sugar at the end of the ten min- 
utes", and boil up once to throw the scum to the top ; skim 
and let it get perfectly cold ; then skim off all remaining 
impurities; add one quart of the best brandy and shake 
hard for five minutes. Bottle, seal the corks, and lay the 
bottles on their sides in dry sawdust. 

Currant Wine. — One quart of currant juice, three pounds 
of brown sugar, and one gallon of water; dissolve the sugar 
in the water, then add the juice ; when it ferments, add a 
little fresh water eacli day till it is done fermenting, which 
will be in from a month and a half to two months ; turn it 
off, scald the keg, put it in again, and cork tightly. 



BEVERAGES. 239 

Raspberry Wine. — Bruise the raspberries with the back of 
a spoon ; strain them through a flannel bag ; add one pound 
of loaf sugar to one quart of juice; stir well and cover 
closely, letting it stand for three days, stirring well each 
day. Pour off the clear juice and add one quart of juice 
to two quarts of sherry wine ; bottle it and use in two 
weeks. 

Raspberry Brandy. — Using brandy instead of wine, as 
above, will produce a very valuable medicinal drink, Rasp- 
berry Brandy. 

Raspberry Vinegar. — Take three pints of red berries ; pour 
over them one pint of cider vinegar and let stand twenty- 
four hours. Strain, and to one pint of juice add one 
pound of sugar ; boil one-half hour, and when cold, bottle 
for use. 

Cherry Brandy. — Use either morello cherries or small black 
cherries ; pick them from the stalks ; fill the bottles nearly 
up to the necks, then fill up with brandy (some use whisky, 
gin, or spirit distilled from the lees of wine). In three 
weeks or a month strain off the spirit ; to each quart add 
one pound of loaf sugar clarified, and flavor with tincture 
of cinnamon or cloves. 

Sherbet. — In a quart of water boil six or eight sticks of 
rhubarb ten minutes ; strain the boiling liquor on the . thin 
shaved rind of a lemon. Two ounces of clarified sugar, 
with a wineglassful of brandy, stir to the above, and let it 
stand five or six hours before using. 

Ginger Beer. — Two ounces of ginger to a pint of molasses ; 
add a gallon of warm water ; stir it well, and add half a pint 
of lively yeast. If you wish it sweeter or hotter, add gin- 
ger or molasses before putting in the yeast, to suit your 
taste. 



240 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Spruce Beer. — To three gallons of boiling water, add two 
pounds of molasses and two ounces of essence of spruce. 
Let the mixture cool, and when lukewarm, add a scant gill 
of yeast and set aside to ferment. While the fermentation 
goes on, skim frequently. When it becomes inactive, put in 
stone bottles and tie the corks down. White sugar may be 
used instead of molasses, and will give a better color. 

Quick Beer. — To fourteen quarts of water add one quart of 
molasses, one quart of hop yeast, and four tablespoonfuls of 
ginger. Mix well ; strain through a fine sieve ; bottle im- 
mediately. Ready for use in twenty-four hours. 

Imperial — Mix in a jug one-half ounce of cream tartar 
and one quart of boiling water ; flavor with lemon peel or 
essence of lemon, and sweeten to taste. This is a refreshing 
and pleasantly stimulating summer drink. 

Mead. — Mix six gallons of water with six quarts of 
strained honey ; add the yellow rind of two large lemons, 
pared thin, and the whites of three eggs beaten to a stiff 
froth. Mix well and boil - three-quarters of an hour, skim- 
ming thoroughly. Pour into a tub, add three tablespoonfuls 
of good yeast, and leave it ferment. When it is well worked, 
pour into a barrel with some lemon peel, and let it stand six 
months. Then bottle and tie down the corks. It is ready 
for immediate use, or will keep for months in a cool place.

XIX.— CANDIES. 

CARE NEEDED TO COOK CANDY ; WHEN COOKED ENOUGH ; FLAVOR- 
ING, COOLING, AND PULLING. TWENTY-ONE RECIPES FOR CANDY. 

THE great danger in candy-making is that of burning the 
sugar. To properly cook the candy requires a heat of 
about two hundred and fifty degrees. Less than that 
heat will leave the candy soft and sticky. A very little more 
than two hundred and sixty degrees will burn it. Here, 
then, is the need of care in candy-making. 

In the cooking, allow the heat to reach the bottom of the 
pan only. Have a quick fire that the work may be done in 
the shortest possible time. When cooked for about fifteen 
minutes, test a spoonful of the mass upon a cold plate. If it 
form a viscid, tenacious mass, which forms a long, adherent 
thread when drawn out, then it is nearly done, and it needs 
special care lest it burn before the work be completed. Test 
frequently now, dropping a little in cold water. When the 
hardened portion is crisp as a pipestem, the cooking has 
gone far enough. Then comes the flavoring and coloring. 

When the mass has cooled on a stone or buttered plate, 
so that it can be handled, it is ready for pulling, rolling into 
sticks, shaping into forms, etc. The pulling process is 
simply a mechanical means of whitening the candy. It is 
literally a. pulling, the candy being thrown on a hook and 
pulled out from it, then being thrown on it again and again 
pulled, and so on, as may be desired, the longer pulling giv- 
ing the whiter candy. 

For home-made candies use pure materials and good 
fruit. Enough of earths and starch and decayed fruits are 
bought in the cheap candies of the stores.

- RECIPES. 

ffloiasses Candy. — Three cupfuls of brown sugar, one-half 
cupful of molasses, one cupful of water, one-half teaspoonful 
of cream tartar, butter the size of a walnut. Bring to aboil, 
and when crisp by testing in cold water, flavor ; pour out on 
a buttered plate, and pull to whiteness if desired. 

Butter Scotch. — Two cupfuls of sugar, two tablespoonfuk 
of water, a piece of butter the size of an egg. Boil without 
stirring, until it hardens on a spoon. Pour out on buttered 
plates to cool. 

Ice-cream Candy. — Take two cupfuls of granulated sugar, 
half a cupful of water, and add one-quarter of a teaspoonful 
of cream tartar dissolved in a teaspoonful of boiling water. 
Put it in a porcelain kettle, and boil ten minutes without 
stirring it. Drop a few drops into a saucer of cold water or 
on snow. If it become brittle, it is done ; if not, boil till it is. 
Add a piece of butter half as large as an egg while it is on 
the fire, and stir it in. Pour into a buttered tin, and set on 
ice or snow to cool enough to pull it white. Flavor with 
vanilla just before it is cool enough to pull. Work into 
strands and cut into sticks. 

Cream Candy. — One pound of white sugar, three table, 
spoonfuls of vinegar, one teaspoonful of lemon extract, one 
teaspoonful of cream tartar. Add a little water to moisten 
the sugar, and boil until brittle. Put in the extract, then 
turn quickly out on buttered plates. When cool, pull until 
white, and cut in squares.. 

Cocoanut Candy. — Grate very fine a sound cocoanut, spread 
it on a dish, and let it dry naturally for three days, as it will 
not bear the heat of an oven, and is too oily for use when 
freshly broken. Four ounces will be sufficient for a pound 
of sugar for most tastes, but more can be used at pleasure. 
To one pound of sugar, take one-half pint of water, a very 



CANDIES. 243 

little white of egg, and then pour over the sugar ; let it 
stand for a short time, then place over a very clear fire, and 
let it boil for a few minutes ; then set it one side until the 
scum is subsided, clear it off, and boil the sugar until very 
thick ; then strew in the nut, stir and mix it well, and do not 
quit for an instant until it is finished. The pan should not 
be placed on the fire, but over it, as the nut is liable to burn 
with too fierce a heat. 

Almond Candy. — Proceed in the same way as for cocoanut 
candy. Let the almonds be blanched and perfectly dry, and 
do not throw them into the sugar until they approach the 
candying point. 

Candied Nuts and Fruits. — Three cupfuls of sugar, one cup- 
ful of water ; boil until it hardens when dropped in water, 
then flavor with lemon. It must not boil after the lemon is 
put in. Put a nut on the end of a fine knitting needle, take 
out, and turn on the needle until it is cool. If the candy 
gets cold, set on the stove for a few minutes. Malaga 
grapes, and oranges quartered, may be candied in the same 
way. 

Chocolate Caramels. — Two cupfuls of sugar, one cupful 
of warm water, one-half cupful of Bensdorp's Chocolate, 
grated, three-fourths of a cupful of butter. Let it boil 
without stirring until it snaps in water. 

Chocolate Caramels, No. 2. — One cupful rich, sweet cream ; 
one cupful brown sugar ; one cupful white sugar ; seven 
tablespoonfuls Bensdorp's Chocolate ; one tablespoonful 
corn-starch stirred in the cream ; one tablespoonful butter ; 
vanilla flavoring ; soda, size of a pea, stirred into cream. 
Boil all ingredients, except the chocolate and vanilla ex- 
tract, half an hour, stirring to prevent burning. Reserve 
half of the cream and wet up the chocolate in it, adding 
a very little water if necessary. Draw the saucepan to 
the side of the range, and stir this in well ; put back on 



244 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

the fire and boil ten minutes longer, quite fast, stirring con- 
stantly. When it makes a hard, glossy coat on the spoon, 
it is done. Add the vanilla after taking it from the range. 
Turn into shallow dishes, well buttered. When cold 
enough to retain the impression of the knife, cut into 
squares. 

Lemon Taffy. — Two cupfuls of white sugar, one cupful of 
boiling water, one-quarter cupful of vinegar, one-half cupful 
of butter ; flavor withiemon ; pour in buttered plates to cool. 

Butter Taffy. — One tablespoonful of vinegar, one cupful of 
sugar, two tablespoonfuls of molasses, and a piece of butter 
the size of an egg. When done, add a little soda. 

Cream Chocolates. — For the creams, boil two cupfuls of 
white sugar and one-half cupful of milk for five minutes ; 
add one teaspoonful of vanilla, then beat until stiff enough 
to handle and make into drops. 

For the chocolate, take six ounces of Bensdorp's 
Chocolate, grate and steam over the teakettle. Drop the 
creams when hard, one at a time, into the hot chocolate, 
using two forks to take them out quickly; set the 
drop on one fork on the bottom, using the other fork to 
scrape the chocolate off the cream ; gently slip the drop 
upon a buttered dish. If, when cool, the drop sticks to the 
dish, hold it over the steam of the teakettle for an instant. 

Chocolate Creams. — Inside: Two cupfuls of sugar ; one 
cupful of water ; one and a half tablespoonfuls of arrow- 
root ; mix ; let them boil from five to eight minutes ; stir al/ 
the time. After taking from the fire, stir until it comes 
to a cream. When smooth, add one teaspoonful Met- 
calf's Water White Vanilla and make cream into balls. 

Outside: Melt a half pound of Bensdorp's Choco- 
late, but do not add water to it. Roll the cream balls 
into the chocolate while it is warm. 



CANDIES. 245 

Cream Walnuts. — Two cupfuls sugar, two-thirds cupful 
water. Boil without stirring until it will spin a thread ; 
flavor with vanilla. Set off into a dish with a little cold 
water in it ; stir briskly until white and creamy. Have the 
walnuts shelled ; make the cream into small, round cakes 
with your fingers ; press half a walnut on either side, and 
drop into sifted granulated sugar. 

Cream Dates. — For cream dates, take fresh California dates, 
remove the stones, and fill the centre of dates with the same 
cream as used in cream walnuts. Drop into sugar. 

Peanut Candy. — Boil one scant pint of molasses until it 
hardens in cold water. Stir in two tablespoonfuls of vanilla, 
then one teaspoonful of soda, dry. Lastly, the shelled pea- 
nuts, taken from four quarts measured before shelling. 
Turn out into shallow pans well buttered, and press it down 
smooth with a wooden spoon. 

Philadelphia Groundnut Cakes. — Boil two pounds of light 
brown sugar in a preserving kettle, with enough water to 
wet it thoroughly and form a sirup. Have ready a quarter 
of a peck of groundnuts (peanuts). When the sugar begins 
to boil, throw in the white of an egg to clear it. Skim and 
try by dropping a little into cold water to see if brittle or 
done. When it is brittle, remove from the fire, and stir in 
the nuts. Drop on wet plates, free from grease. The white 
of egg may be omitted. 

Gum Drops. — Dissolve one pound of gum arabic in one and 
a half pints of water; strain and add one pound of refined 
sugar ; beat until the sugar is entirely dissolved. Flavor to 
taste, and add coloring if desired. Then evaporate with a 
slow heat until the mass is thick as honey. Have a shallow 
box, or dish of fine starch ; in this make a series of dents 
with a rounded stick, the size desired for the gum drops. 
Into each of these indentations drop from a spout, or a 



246 *»£ HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

spoon, just enough of the thickened mass to fill the cavity, 
then set away in a warm place till the drops become suffi- 
ciently set to allow handling. This may require several 
days. 

Jujube Paste. — Dissolve gum arabi.c, and add sugar as for 
gum drops. Evaporate till very thick, and while still warm 
flavor and pour out into shallow tin pans to cool. 

Pig Paste. — Chop up one pound of figs, and boil in a pint 
of water till reduced to a soft pulp. Strain through a fine 
sieve, and add three pounds of sugar. Evaporate over boil- 
ing water till the paste becomes stiff, then pour it into a 
mold of wooden strips tied together. When cool, cut into 
squares ; sugar each well, and put away for use. Flavors 
may be added to taste, or fresh fruits may be mingled with 
the paste. 

Peppermint Drops. — Mix granulated sugar with enough 
water to form a paste, and put it to boil in a saucepan hav- 
ing a lip from which the contents can be poured or dropped. 
Allow it come almost, but not entirely, to a boil. Stir con- 
tinually. Allow it to cool a little, and flavor to taste with 
strong essence of peppermint. Then drop the mass on 
sheets of tin or of white paper. To drop it properly, allow 
just enough to gather at the lip of the saucepan, and then 
stroke it off with a piece of stiff wire. They should dry in 
a warm place.

medicinal, and remedial qualities of the preparation 
continue unchanged, so do its reputation, value, and 
power to do good by annihilating disease, remain 
unimpaired.

has long since ceased to be a medical experiment. It has passed beyond 
the field of speculation, and is acknowledged one of the greatest successes 
and achievements of modern medical research and discovery. True it is 
that there are cases of disease which, through neglect, have passed be- 
yond the reach of human skill ; but there is no class of diseases which 
yield so readily to prompt and judicious treatment as those of the pulmo- 
nary organs. Therefore we would advise not only as a matter of safety, 
but for economy's sake, an early resort to this remedy by all those who 
feel the premonitory symptoms of the diseases for which it is a cure.

MURDOCK'S LIQUID FOOD 

Is the only Food that can be retained by the stomach when it refuses all other Foods, 
and Extracts. Such has been the fact for twenty-three years, as it is the only Raw Food 
known in the world. 

The nutritious properties of meats, and also of fruits, have never been separated 
from their indigestible properties in the raw or cooked state, until I discovered the proc- 
ess in 1881 that has enabled me to make Murdock's Liquid Food. And since then it has 
been made by me and always by the same formula and warranted sweet in all countries 
and of any age. The twelve years, prior to 1881, 1 was working, my experiments were 
all failures, and of no more value than other food preparations, as they are only extracts. 
Murdock's Liquid Food is Raw, condensed twelve fold, and free of insoluble matter, 
which enables it to be absorbed without the labor of digestion. 

These facts were confirmed by results obtained in Our Free Surgical Hospital for 
Women, in which we gave 3,872 internal operations with a loss of 6 to the 1,000, when 
women in health die 30 to the 1,000 annually. 

Also confirmed by five Essays before the American Medical Association, of both 
schools, and the British Medical Association, when after the Essays were read they were 
discussed and endorsed by the members. 

Professor S. P. Sharpies', State Chemist for Massachusetts, analysis shows that 
Murdock's Liquid Food contains 16 28-100 per cent, albuminoids. We only claim to 
protect our claim, 12 per cent. 

Again, Dr. Sam. L. Abbot, our State Chemist in 1886, compared Murdock's Liquid 
Food with other foods and tonics, and found it to excel them all, as it contained 14.10 
per cent, of albumen ; all the other foods do not contain any, and common food does 
not contain over one per cent, that is available. 

It contains less organic matter than common food, and common food contains 16.85, 
the other preparations contain 22.62 to 60.50 per cent. It contains 0.42 per cent, of ash, 
which is indigestible matter. The others contain 3.30 to 23.74 per cent. In alcoholic 
extracts 1.07 per cent. The other preparations are all TONICS, as they contain from 
20.13 to 56.10 per cent. 

We make our own extracts from the different fruits we use, instead of using ex- 
tracts from other manufacturers. We use fruit for the properties they possess, and they 
each have, different properties, which all scientific men acknowledge to be of as great 
value as the beeves and sheep that we use, and all are selected from the best the market 
contains. 

These facts show why Murdock's Liquid Food does restore patients to health when 
all other treatments and preparations fail ; as it is the only Raw Food preparation in the 
world, condensed and free from insoluble matter ; and has been so since 1881, and will 
continue to be, as many chemists have tried to produce its formula and all have proved 
failures.

XXI -INVALID DIET. 

INVALIDS NEED THE BEST OF DIET J WHAT INVALID DIET SHOULD 
FURNISH; "SICK-DIET KITCHENS;" HOME COOKING FOR TH£ 
SICK. THIRTY RECIPES FOR SICK-ROOM DIET. 

WHAT is more disgusting to an invalid than to be 
served with a liberal supply of food adapted to a 
laboring man or to a person in robust health ? Deli- 
cate appetites need to be delicately appealed to with dainty 
dishes, nicely served. But these dishes must be nourishing 
and easily digested. In short, the problem in sick-room 
diet is, how to furnish the patient the most valuable nutri- 
tion in the pleasantest form, and with the least tax upon his 
enfeebled powers. 

To meet this need, organized movements have been made 
in many cities in the line of" Sick-Diet Kitchens." Benevo- 
lent contributions and skilled work are the corner-stones oi 
these institutions. The foods are well prepared by compe- 
tent hands. The sick who choose to purchase delicacies 
which can be relied on, can find them at these places. 
Those who are too poor to purchase, but who are deserving, 
can have them free. Instruction concerning diet for the sick 
is given also. 

But many cannot reach such establishments, and do not 
care to if they can ; hence the chapter of directions given 
below. If anywhere in cookery good materials and skillful 
manipulation are of value it is in cooking for the sick. 

RECIPES. 

Beef Tea. — One pound of lean beef, cut into small pieces. 
Put into a jar without a drop of water, cover tightlv. set in 



252 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

a pot of cold water. Heat gradually to a boil, and continue 
this steadily for three or four hours, until the meat is like 
white rags and the juice all drawn out. Season with salt to 
taste, and when cold, skim. The patient will often prefer 
this ice-cold. 

Beef Tea, No. 2. — Take lean, juicy beef, chopped very finely ; 
cover with cold water, and set on back of the range for two 
hours; then draw forward, allowing it to heat gradually; 
then boil for five minutes. Season and strain. 

Mutton Broth. — One pound of lean mutton, cut small ; one 
quart Gf water, cold ; one tablespoonful of rice or barley, 
soaked in a very little warm water; four tablespoonfuls 
of milk, salt and pepper, with a little chopped parsley. 
Boil- the meat, unsalted, in the water, keeping it closely 
covered, until it falls to pieces. Strain it out, add the soaked 
barley or rice; simmer half an hour, stirring oftenj stir in 
the seasoning and the milk, and simmer five minutes after it 
heats up well, taking care it does not burn. Serve hot. with 
cream crackers. 

Chicken Broth. — Proceed precisely as above, but substitute 
chicken for mutton. 

Chicken Jelly. — Half a raw chicken, pounded with a mallet, 
bones and meat together ; plenty of cold water to cover it 
well, about a. quart. Heat slowly in a covered vessel, and 
let it simmer until the meat is in white rags and the liquid 
reduced one-half. Strain and press, first through a colan- 
der, then through a coarse cloth. Salt to taste, and pepper 
if you think best ; return to the fire, and simmer five min- 
utes longer. Skim when cool. Give to the patient cold — 
just from the ice — with unleavened wafers. Keep on the 
ice, or make into sandwiches by putting the jelly between 
thin slices of bread spread lightly with butter. 

Soft Boiled Eggs. — Put in a pan of boiling water, and set on 
a part of the range where they will not boil for several min- 



INVALID DIET. 25$ 

utes. At the end of that time they will be like jelly, per- 
fectly soft, but beautifully done, and quite digestible by even 
weak stomachs. 

Egg Gruel. — Beat the yelk of one egg with one rablespoon- 
ful of sugar; pour one teacupful of boiling water on it; add 
the white of the egg beaten to a froth, with any seasoning 
or spice desired. To be taken warm. 

Raw Egg. — Break a fresh egg into a glass, beat until very 
light, sweeten to taste, and add two tablespoonfuls of port 
wine, then beat again. 

Egg Cream. — Beat a raw egg to a stiff froth ; add a table- 
spoonful of white sugar and a half wineglass of good black- 
berry wine; add half a glass • of cream; beat together 
thoroughly, and use at once. 

Indian-meal Gruel. — One tablespoonful of fine Indian-meal, 
mixed smooth with cold water and a saltspoonful of salt ; 
pour upon this a pint of boiling water and turn into a sauce- 
pan to boil gently for half an hour ; thin it with boiling 
water if it thickens too much, and stir frequently ; when it 
is done, a tablespoonful of cream or a little new milk may 
be put in to cool it after straining, but if the patient's stom- 
ach is weak it is best without either. Some persons like it 
sweetened and a little nutmeg added, but to many it is more 
palatable plain. 

Oatmeal Gruel. — Soak a handful of oatmeal over night in 
water, in order that the acid gases which oatmeal contains 
may be withdrawn. Pour off the water, and add a pint of 
fresh ; stir it well, add salt, and boil an hour and a half. 
This is much used, prepared in this way, by dyspeptics. 

Sago.— Soak and wash it well ; add a pint of water, a little 
salt, and boil till clear. Add lemon-juice or wine, if 
permitted. 

Arrow-root Jelly. — Boil a pint of water with a few bits of 



254 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

cinnamon or yellow rind of lemon ; stir into it two table- 
spoonfuls of arrow-root, dissolved in a little water ; boil ten 
minutes ; strain, salt, and season with sugar, wine, and nut- 
meg, if proper. 

Arrow-root Broth. — Put half a pint of water into a sauce- 
pan ; add a little lemon-juice, sugar and nutmeg, and a very 
little salt. Boil it up, and stir in a teaspoonful of disso.'ved 
arrow-root ; boil five minutes. It should be taken warm 
and be very thin. 

Cracked Wheat — To one quart of hot water take one small 
teacupful of cracked wheat and a little salt ; boil slowly for 
half an hour, stirring occasionally to prevent burning. Serve 
with sugar and cream or new milk. 

Cracker Panada. — Six Boston crackers, split ; two table- 
spoonfuls of white sugar, a good pinch of salt, and a little 
nutmeg; enough boiling water to cover them well. Split the 
crackers, and pile in a bowl in layers, salt and sugar scat- 
tered among them. Cover with boiling water and set on 
the hearth, with a close top over the bowl, for at least an 
hour. The crackers should be almost clear and soft as jelly, 
but not broken. Eat from the bowl with more sugar 
sprinkled in. 

Bread Panada. — Set a little water on the fire in a very 
clean saucepan ; add a glass of wine, if allowed, some sugar, 
nutmeg, and lemon-peel. The moment it boils up stir in a 
few crumbs of stale baker's loaf. Let it boil very fast for 
five minutes. It should be only thick enough to drink. 

Chicken Panada. — Boil a chicken ; take a few bits of the 
breast and pound fine in a mortar. Season it with a little 
salt, a grate of nutmeg, and a bit of lemon-peel ; boil gently 
till a little thick, but so that it can be drank. 

Soft Toast — Some invalids like this very much indeed, and 
nearly all do when it is nicely made. Toast well, but not 



INVALID DIET. 255 

too brown, a couple of thin slices of bread; put them on a 
warm plate and pour over boiling water ; cover quickly with 
another plate of the same size, and drain the water off; re- 
move the upper plate, butter the toast, put it in the oven 
one minute, and then cover again with a hot plate and serve 
at once. 

Milk Porridge. — Two cupfuls of best oatmeal, two cupfuls 
of water, two cupfuls of milk. Soak the oatmeal over night 
in the water; strain in the morning, and boil the water half 
an hour. Put in the milk with a little salt, boil up well, and 
serve. Eat warm, with or without powdered sugar. 

Thickened Milk. — With a little milk, mix smooth a table- 
spoonful of flour and a pinch of salt. Pour upon it a quart 
of boiling milk, and when both are thoroughly mingled put 
all back into the saucepan and boil up once, being careful 
not to burn, and stirring all the time to keep it perfectly 
smooth and free from lumps. Serve with slices of dry toast. 
It is excellent in diarrhoea, and becomes a specific by scorch- 
ing the flour before mixing with the milk. 

Toast Water. — Toast stale bread until quite brown, but do 
not burn it ; put it into a large bowl, and pour over it boil- 
ing water ; let it stand for an hour or so, strain, and put in 
a piece of ice before drinking. 

Barley Water. — Soak one pint of barley in lukewarm water 
for a few minutes; then drain off the water. Put the barley 
in three quarts of cold water and cook slowly until the 
barley is quite soft, skimming occasionally. This barley 
water, when cold, flavor with a little jelly or lemonade. 

Rice TVfiflr. — Pick and wash the rice carefully ; boil it in 
water until it swells and softens ; when the water is partly 
boiled away, add some milk. It may be boiled entirely in 
milk, by setting the vessel in which the rice is in boiling 
water ; sweeten with white sugar and season with nutmeg. 
It also may be thickened with a little flour or beaten egg. 



256 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Flaxseed Tea. — One-half pound of flaxseed, one-half pound 
of rock candy, and three lemons pared and sliced; pour 
over this two quarts of boiling water ; let it stand until very 
cold ; strain before drinking. This is good for a cough. 

Appleade. — Cut two large apples in slices, and pour on 
them one pint of boiling water; strain well and sweeten. 
Ice it before drinking. 

Apple Water. — Roast two large, tart apples until they are 
soft. Put them in a pitcher, pour a pint of cold water on 
them, and let them stand in a cool place for an hour. No 
sweetening is needed. This drink will be found very 
refreshing if the patient have fever or eruptive diseases. 

Roast Apples. — Good-sized, juicy, tart apples are best for 
roasting. Wipe them clean, and put in a slow oven, allow- 
ing an hour for the work of roasting. When entirely done, 
sift fine, white sugar over them, and serve warm or cold, as 
desired. 

Wino Whey. — Sweeten one pint of milk to taste, and when 
boiling throw in two wineglassfuls of sherry ; when the curd 
forms, strain the whey through a muslin bag into tumblers 

Blackberry Sirup. — One quart of blackberry juice, one 
pound of sugar, one-half ounce of nutmeg, one-half ounce 
of cinnamon, one-fourth of an ounce of cloves, one-fourth 
of an ounce of allspice.

XXII. — HEALTH. 

NO attempt will be made in this chapter to give in- 
struction as to the treatment of the sick. When 
any member of the family is so ill that the experience 
of the housewife does not indicate the treatment to be 
adopted, a physician is the only competent instructor. 

Two-thirds of the diseases that afflict humanity are 
preventable., and the occupant of no other station in 
life has such influence over the well-being of humanity 
as has the housekeeper. This being so, those who 
stand in this high position should perfect themselves in 
the knowledge of the principles of right living. 

The essentials to healthful living, while few in num- 
ber, are too often overlooked or neglec ed. They may 
be stated, iri a general way, as follows, although each 
is in some measure dependent upon the others : Pure 
air, water free from pollution, good food, clean sur- 
roundings, exercise and recreation, proper clothing. 
When careful regard for these is maintained, sickness 
will be a rare visitor. 

If, in any way, the human body be deprived of air 
for only a few minutes, death is the result. Normal 
out-of-doors air contains a certain percentage of oxygen, 
and so delicate is the balance of the human system that 
any decrease in this amount of oxygen in the air, by 
even a very small amount, quickly causes a serious dis- 
turbance of the vital functions. 

When the climatic conditions permit of the windows 
being kept open, the ventilation of the house takes care of 
itself ; but at other times it must be carefully attended to. 

The heating of the house is closely connected with 
the subject of ventilation, and the theory that any kind 



258 THE HOUSEWIFE'S UBRARY: 

of a heating apparatus or system is all right if it but 
keep the house warm, should be abandoned. The heat- 
ing and ventilating of public halls, theatres, etc., where 
a few of the family go for a few hours occasionally, is 
regulated by strict laws enacted in the interest of the 
public health. How much more important is it that the 
house we live in, where all of us spend from eight to 
twelve hours every day, should be properly warmed and 
ventilated ! 

While it is true that man can live without water for 
a longer time than he can without air, impure water 
is as surely disastrous in its effects upon the human 
system as impure air. In cities and towns where there 
is a public water works, the purity of the water from 
this source can usually be depended upon, in so far as 
public oversight can guarantee it, and is always to be 
preferred to water taken from wells or springs within 
populated districts. Where there is no public water 
works and the supply is obtained from wells, springs, 
cisterns or streams, great care should be taken to make 
sure that no pollution of the supply can have taken 
place. If there is the slightest doubt as to the purity of 
the water supply, whatever the source, it should be 
purified before using by some approved method. 

Undoubtedly among all the things that make for the 
health of the family, none is of greater importance than 
pure food properly prepared. The well-nourished indi- 
vidual has little to fear from disease, and the selection 
and preparation of the food for the family may well 
receive from the housewife the attention that its impor- 
tance deserves. At the present day, when the house- 
keeper has such a variety of food supplies, either wholly 
or partly ready to eat, as well as those which are wholly 



HEALTH. • 259 

unprepared, from which to choose, it should be a matter 
of care and attention only to find the food that will agree 
with and properly nourish each member of the family. 

Clean surroundings. — By this term is meant, not simply 
clean to the eye, but actually clean. The dirt that is 
visible to the eye is exposed to the light and air, and is 
rapidly disinfected by these agents. It is the dirt that 
hides under carpets and in dark corners, that lodges in 
the cracks of the wood finish of the sink-room and bath- 
room, that is a source of constant menace to the health 
of the family. For this reason closely joined hardwood 
floors and rugs are to be preferred to carpets, and some 
wall-finish similar to tile is to be preferred over the usual 
deep-jointed wood-finish. 

Outside the house the surroundings should receive as 
much attention as is bestowed upon the living rooms, for 
the air in those rooms cannot be pure if the outside air is 
polluted with decaying waste products. Kitchen garbage 
should not be allowed to stand in open tubs near the 
back door, and all pipes and drains, both within and 
without the house, should be constructed and maintained 
in accordance with well-established sanitary practice. 

The house should be well screened against flies and 
mosquitoes, for it is now definitely known that these in- 
sects are carriers of disease, and all breeding or swarm- 
ing places for these insects about the premises should be 
done away with. 

Exercise and recreation. — These are exceedingly im- 
portant helps in maintaining health, and each member of 
the family should each day engage for a time in such ex- 
ercise, game or amusement as will give them a complete 
change from what they know as work. If this recreation or 
exercise takes them into the open air, so much the better. 



260 " THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

By proper clothing is meant clothing in which one 
feels neither too warm nor too cold. A person should be 
so clothed that, as near as possible, the clothing is not 
thought of. Many people heap clothes upon themselves 
and their children, creating conditions of too free per- 
spiration, and then wonder why they feel and are sub- 
ject to the cold. 

When, for any cause, sickness comes to any member 
of the family, accompanied with symptoms which are 
unfamiliar,' or which are known to be grave, consult the 
physician at once. Nevertheless, for the treatment of 
those cases with which the housewife has had experi- 
ence, and for use in emergencies, there are certain 
supplies and appliances that should be in every home. 
Approved preparations for the treatment of a simple 
cold ; a cough ; indigestion and colic ; constipation ; 
diarrhoea. An approved purgative. Some safe prepa- 
ration to induce sleep. In families where there are 
children, there should always be remedies for use in 
cases of croup or convulsions. 

In addition to the above, there are certain medical 
and surgical appliances that should be kept in every 
home, as they are likely to be needed from time to time, 
and, when needed, must be had promptly. They in- 
clude : i- clinical thermometer ; a hot-water bag of at 
least three quarts' capacity ; a hand bulb syringe ; a 
hard rubber syringe of about four ounces' capacity ; an 
atomizer ; a rubber ice-bag ; a glass dropper ; a meas- 
uring glass ; a glass feeding-tube ; antiseptic gauze, 
and some approved disinfectant and germicide for dress- 
ing all wounds, burns and sores, however trivial they 
may appear ; a surgeon's scissors ; tweezers.

XXIII.— MARKETING. 



OPPORTUNITIES vary so in different localities, that 
general rules about marketing are hard to frame. In 
rural places the butcher drives to the door, and the 
customer must be content with what is found in the wagon. 
To know the parts of the animals sold in the markets, 
and to understand their relative value and most economical 
uses, is the first requisite in successful marketing. Cutting 
of animals varies somewhat among butchers of different 
places, but the chart given below will fairly set forth the 
usual methods of cutting, and the ordinary designations oi 
the several portions. 




CHART ILLUSTRATING THE CUTTING OF BEEF. 



In explanation of the illustration of the cutting of bed 
the following notes will suffice : 

No. I. — The choice cut of the beef, the Sirloin, containing 
the kidneys and the tenderloin. These are the finest pieces 
of roasting and steak meat. 

No. 2. — The Standing Rib piece, also a choice roastingpor- 
fcion. which includes about eleven of the ribs. 



262 THE HOUSEWIFE S LIBRARY. 

No. 3. — The Chuck Rids, also used for roasting, but of a 
less desirable quality and usually sold at a lower price. 

No. 4. — The neck, with considerable bone, used generally 
for stewing and for pot roast. 

No. 5. — The Cheek, or jowl, a fleshy part, used for stew- 
ing or for boiling. 

No. 6.— The Rump, sometimes cut differently from the 
manner shown in the diagram, which is the usual cutting at 
the East, for domestic purposes. This part has very little 
bone and is generally used for choice steaks, and the par 
tion next the tail, left from the steak cutting, is a choice 
piece for corning. 

No. 7. — The Pin-bone, a choice piece for roasting, being 
very tender. 

No. 8. — The Round, which furnishes common steaks, and 
is the choice cut for dried beef or for corning. 

No. 9. — The Leg, the choice soup piece. 

No. 10. — The Shin, also used for soup. 

No. 1 1. — The Thin flank, used for boiling and for corning. 

No. 12. — The Brisket, used for corning. 

No. 13. — The Plate, used for family boiling and for 
corning. 

No. 14. — The Plate (thick end), extending under the 
shoulder, used for corning and family boiling. 

No. 15. — The Breast, or butt end of the brisket, also 
called the " sticking piece." Used for corning and souj>' 
meat. 

If the cutting vary materially from this plan, it is still 
true that the essential parts of the animal continue to exist 
and are for sale under some name and in some shape. A 
polite inquiry of any reputable butcher will secure the 
desired information as to any part. By this means a person 
may secure intelligent skill in purchasing beef. Some spe- 
cial points concerning beef need a moment's attention. 

The Tongue is used fresh, salted, or smoked. It is a very

desirableand delicate portion, suitable for table use at almost 
any time. The Tail, which affords some meat and much 
gelatinous substance, is prized for soups, ox-tail soup espe- 
cially being founded upon it. The Heart and Liver are used 
for food — the former being stuffed and roasted, the latter 
being fried, usually with onions. The Tripe, which is the 
lining of the large, or receiving stomach of the beef, is used 
for souse, for pepper-pot, etc. It is a cheap article. The 
Kidneys of beef are sold separate from the sirloin, from 
which they are cut. They are used for stewing, etc. Suet, 
used for pie-crust, plum-puddings, mince-meat, etc, is the 
solid, clear fat, which incloses the kidney. When pure it 
is a very desirable article. The Feet are used for jellies, 
though not so delicate as the calf's foot. The Head is refuse. 
The Marrow-bones are those of the shin, leg, and round. 
Any of the round, hollow bones contain marrow. The 
other remains of beef are refuse, except as available for 
manufacturing purposes. 

VEAL. 

Veal is a favorite meat. Consult the points concerning it 
made upon page 76. Veal is cut as shown below. 

No. 1. — Loin, the best end. It is the favorite roasting 
piece, and furnishes the 
choice chops. It com- 
mands the best price. 

No. 2. — Fillet, or cutlet

choice part, being excel- 
lent for steaks and for 
roasting and filling. It

desirable and lower priced than the loin, having more 
bone. 

No. 5.— The Neck, used for stewing, pies, etc. The best 
end is quite desirable, that nearer the head being of less 
value. 

No. 6. — Head. The brains and tongue are prized by many, 
the former for frying as a delicacy, the latter for boiling. 
The head, as a whole, is used in mock turtle and some other 
fency soups. 

No. 7. — The Shoulder, used for roasting, for which it 
answers a good purpose. It is valuable for a stew also. 

No. 8. — The Breast. This is the second choice piece for 

stuffing and roasting. It is too valuable for pies, stews, etc 

No. 9. — The Shin. This usually goes with the shoulder, 

with which it is often roasted. If used separately, it answers 

Surly well for stewing. 

The Sweetbread, a very delicate portion, belongs with the 
oreast. It is often sold separately, however. The Kidneys 
are sold with the loin, in the fat of which they are imbedded. 
The Heart and Liver are great delicacies for frying, or the 
heart for stuffing and roasting. The Feet are the basis of 
genuine calves-foot jelly, and are much prized for this pur- 
pose. The Entrails, cut open and well cleaned, are made 
into souse by some persons. 

MUTTON. 
Next to beef, the most profitable and healthful meat is 
mutton. In all markets this meat is cut substantially in the 
game manner as shown in the following chart. The names 
and ordinary uses of the parts are as follows : 

No. I. — The Loin, best end. This is the choice piece for 
filling and roasting and for prime chops. Of course, it com- 
mands the best price. 

No. 2. — The Leg. This joint is nearly always used for 
roasting and chops, sometimes also for boiling. It has but 
little bone, as compared with the other parts of the animal. 



MARKETING. 265 

and is, therefore, an economical piece to select, though the 
price per pound be greater than that of any other cut. It 
is common to find a good leg weighing from seven to twelve 
pounds. 

No. 3. — The Loin, second choice. This furnishes " French

chops," a favorite dish in eating-houses, and is specially 
good for a roast. 

No. 4. — The Loin, rump end. Good for roasting and 
boiling. It contains considerable bone. 

No. 5. — The Shoulder, used for boiling and for filling and 
roasting. It is less in price and nearly as good as the leg, 
but it has more bone. 

No. 6. — The Breast, used for stews and for meat pies. A 
pavory, juicy part. 

No. 7. — The Flank. A continuation of the breast, but 
somewhat thinner. This with the breast makes a cheap 
roast, which may be split and filled. 

No. 8. — The Rack. The best end of the rack is used for 
second-rate chops. The neck end of the rack is good for 
stewing only. 

No. 9. — The Neck. This, with the neck end of the rack, 
is for stewing only. 



266 



THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 



No. 10. — The Head. The tongue only is used, the re 
mainder being refuse. 

It is customary to split mutton down the back, and then 
to split each half into parts called hind and fore quarters. 
The saddle is the middle portion before this quartering is 
done. Part of it goes with each quarter. 

The hind quarter of mutton, consisting of the leg and 
the loin, is the choice quarter. It makes a very superior 
large roast, while either of its parts, the leg or the loin, suf- 
fices nicely for a small company. A hind quarter from an 
animal in good condition will weigh from twenty to thirty 
pounds. The Kidneys are used as in beef, so also the heart 
and liver. The other parts are refuse. 

LAMB. 
Lamb is cut as mutton, but it is usually dressed with 
more care, so as to present a more attractive appearance. 
Lamb proper is in market in the spring only. As the sea-> 
son advances older lamb is in market, but what is called 
"lamb" in the winter months is usually poor mutton 
dressed lamb style. The butcher indulges in a quiet smile 
when his customer, in the winter season, asks for and pays 
for " lamb." Of course, the superiority and rarity of lamb 

demand for it the best 
prices. Indeed, "fancy 
prices " reign in lamb. 
For tests, see p. 82. 
PORK. 
Fresh pork and salt 
pork are much used. 
General facts on pork 
are given on page 85. 
The usual method of cutting for domestic use is shown in 
the accompanying cut. For packing a somewhat different 
method is pursued. 
No. 1. — The Ham, the most valuable part of the hog.

PORK. 



MARKETING. 267 

When nicely cured it is a very great delicacy. It is a great 
article of commerce also. 

No. 2. — Sirloin, furnishing chops and the finest roast- 
ing pieces. 

No. 3. — Rack, used for second-rate chops and roasts, 
the meat being as sweet, but the bone being greater than in 
the sirloin. 

No. 4. — Neck, used for inferior roasting, and for bailing 
when fresh, and also for corning. 

No. 5. — The Shoulder. A fair roasting piece, but chieflj 
used, like the ham, for pickling and curing, though it is 
greatly inferior to ham in juiciness and flavor. Either fresh 
or corned it is a fine boiling piece. 

No. 6. — The Jowl. Useful for smoking. Sometimes cured 
with the tongues remaining in them. 

No. 7. — The Head. Used for puddings and head cheese. 

No. 8. — The Belly or Flitch. A good boiling piece either 
fresh, salted, or smoked. 

No. 9. — Feet. These are much used for souse and for 
pickling. They contain so much gelatinous matter that they 
are exceedingly desirable. 

The Ears also are used for souse and head cheese. The 
Liver, Heart, and Kidneys are used for liver pudding. The 
Entrails, nicely cleaned, are used for sausage skins. The Fat 
about the kidneys furnishes leaf lard. The other fat fur- 
nishes common lard. The other parts are refuse. 
VENISON. 

If the marketer desires venison, it is well to remember 
that buck venison is best from August 1st to November 1st, 
and that doe venison is best from the latter date to January 
1st, after which no deer should be killed. It is quite com- 
mon, however, to *reeze deer meat, and to keep it for months 
in that state. This adds to the cost, but it also improve* 
the fibre of the meat. 

Venison is cut into parts respectively designated haunch 



268 THE HOUSE WIFE'S LIBRAR Y 

saddle, leg, loin, fore-quarter, and steaks. The latter should 
not be cut until ready for use. Venison should be fat. It 
cannot be too fat. Its flavor is better after hanging a few 
days, but it should not become rank. To test this, pierce it 
with a skewer and notice the odor. Shun tough venison. 

For roasting, choose the haunch, the saddle, the neck, or 
the shoulder. Cut steaks from the leg. Stew the shoulder, 
or any part which is too thin for satisfactory roasting. 
POULTRY. 

Tests of poultry are given on page 61. But the expe- 
dients resorted to in order to mislead purchasers are so 
numerous that even experts are not wholly safe. Techni- 
cally, the term chickens belongs to fowls under a year old, 
but actually, the entire tribe is included in the name. Capons 
are young roosters, gelded and carefully fed so as to secure 
the utmost delicacy of flesh. Pullets are young hens. 

Turkeys reach their maturity in eight or nine months, 
and hence young, but well-grown turkeys, are in market 
about the fall and winter holidays. Young hen turkeys are 
regarded as best, being fatter and more juicy ; but the male 
turkeys will be larger for the same age. The legs of young 
turkeys are black ; of old ones reddish and rough. Young 
cocks have small spurs; old ones large spurs and very 
rough legs. Fat turkeys, with broad, full breasts, are pre- 
ferable. Soft, pliable feet indicate fresh-killed birds. 

Wild turkeys are deemed to be finer in flavor than tame 
ones. They are in season in November, December, and 
January. They are usually sold with their feathers on. 
Small birds have their well-defined seasons, as have other 
kinds of game, but they admit little choice except as fresh. 
VEGETABLES. 

Every good marketer will supply his table with a variety 
of vegetables all the year round. There is hardly a vege- 
table that cannot be had in our markets at any season, 
either fresh or canned. Railroads and steamers connect the 



MARKETING. 269 

different climates so closely that one hardly knows whether 
he is eating fruits and vegetables in or out of their natural 
season. But it takes a long purse to buy fresh vegetables 
at the North while the ground is yet frozen. Still, there are 
so many vegetables that keep through cold weather that if 
we did not have new ones from the South, there would be, 
nevertheless, a variety from which to choose. Late in the 
spring, when the old vegetables begin to shrink and grow 
rank, we greatly appreciate what comes from the South s 

If one has a good, dry cellar, it is wise to procure in the 
fall vegetables enough for all winter. But if the cellar is 
warm, vegetables will sprout and decay before half the cold 
months have passed. Those best adapted for winter keep- 
ing are onions, squashes, turnips, beets, carrots, parsnips, 
cabbages, and potatoes. Squashes and onions should be 
kept in a very dry room. The others will keep readily in a 
cool, dry cellar, or bedded in sand beneath the reach of frost. 

If vegetables be bought as needed, care must be used to 
get them in good condition. In season, they should never 
appear wilted, but should be fresh and crisp. At no time 
should they be used if suffering from decay. The utmost 
prudence is needed at this point. A very little waste will 
more than counterbalance all you save by purchasing large 
quantities, and by storing for the winter. 

The luxuries of the world are spread at the feet of the 
customer in our markets ; still, extravagant expenditure is 
by no means necessary. Many delicacies are within the 
reach of all. Those who content themselves with sending to 
the markets, miss many golden opportunities. Those who go, 
see for themselves, and embrace many a favoring chance. 
Personal observation ripens into experience also, and the 
experienced purchasers command the situation. 

These remarks apply with equal force to purchasing of 
the grocer, the baker, the milkman, and all, in short, who 
fupply us with the necessaries of life. There are reliable 



270 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

dealers and those of doubtful integrity; but in every case 
the hope of the household is in its provider. Cultivate 
power in this line. 

It is best to deal steadily with persons whom you have 
tried and found reliable. Do not relinquish your indepen- 
dence, so as to suggest to them the idea that they may im- 
pose on you. Be ready to go elsewhere, if the old service 
falls off; but usually those who are regular dealers at a 
place get the best attention, and errors or failures can be 
rectified with ease. 

In all marketing and dealing with storekeepers keep your 
temper. To lose one's temper and scold or threaten, is un- 
dignified and worse than useless. State your .grievances 
calmly and plainly. If they are redressed, all right ; if not 
redressed, you can quietly go elsewhere and bestow your 
patronage. A little suspension of trade with a dealer often 
works wonders. He does not want to lose customers ; but 
such is the waywardness of human nature, that all of us 
need reminders to keep us fully up to duty. Let the dealer 
have these when he needs them, but never at the expense 
of your own self-possession and courteous dignity. 



XXIV.— CARVING. 

THE ART OF CARVING ; REQUISITES ; CARVING TURKEY, CHICKEN, 
DUCKS, GEESE, SMALL BIRDS, BEEF, MUTTON, LAMB, VENISON, 
HAM, PIG, RABBIT, STEAKS, FISH, TONGUE, AND CALF's-HEAD. 

EVERY person who travels or visits much sees number- 
less illustrations of the varied capacities of carvers. 
Hotel and restaurant life does not make much display- 
in this line, as the carving is done out of sight. And yet 
even here the marvelous thinness of the slice, which is so 
immense in its area, demonstrates that somebody is on hand 
who is expert in this line. In private houses the meat and 
the poultry are sometimes carved before they come to the 
table. By whom done, or with what accompaniments of per- 
spiration and emphatic words, the guests know not. But 
meat served thus is chilled and juiceless, and generally dam- 
aged. It is worthy of better treatment. 

Many amusing and not a few irritating examples of 
clumsy carving occur under everybody's eyes. Meat is con- 
demned as tough, knives as dull, dishes as too small, there 
is too much gravy, skewers are not drawn, and a thousand 
other reasons are blurted out by the clumsy carver, as he 
outwardly sweats and inwardly swears at his task. He slops 
gravy on to the cloth ; he drops part of the meat from the 
dish ; he cuts himself by an unfortunate slip of the knife ; 
and sometimes, like a distinguished wit of whom the story 
tells, he lands a fowl in the lap of a lady beside him, 
though probably, unlike that wit, he will not have the grace 
to say, " I will thank you, madam, to return that chicken." 

Every housekeeper should learn to carve. Carving should 
be done at the table by the gentleman of the house, or, in his 



272 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

absence, by the lady, unless some other of the family be an 
expert carver. Unless a guest is known to be an expert, or 
unless he volunteers for the duty, he should not be expected 
to carve. ■ He may be a clumsy hand, and the courtesy of 
hospitality should protect him from exposure at this point 

The carver at a private table should retain his seat while 
carving and serving. To facilitate this, his chair should be 
high, so that he can reach readily to his work. The dish 
should be large enough to prevent soiling the cloth, except 
by some unusual accident. The centre of a carving-dish for 
roast meats should be raised nearly as high as the surround- 
ing edge, so that a horizontal movement of the knife in slicing 
may be made without interference from the edges. No man 
can slice meat neatly if the meat is in the bottom of a deep 
dish, into which he must scoop with his knife as best he 
may. Elevate the meat, but have a surrounding depression 
between the centre and the edge, where the rich juices of the 
meat may accumulate, and where they may be served readily. 

Not all knives are suitable for 'carving, nor is any one knife 
just the thing for all work in this line. For slicing, a long,' 
thin, broad blade is essential. With a fine roast, elevated on 
the dish, and with a good, sharp slicing knife in hand, a 
tool-headed man can hardly help doing neat and rapid work. 

But such a knife is not the one for poultry or rib carving. 
For these uses a shorter blade, which is both narrower and 
stiffer, must be employed. All knives for carving must be 
sharp. There should be a good steel at hand to touch up 
the edge — nothing more, for a dull knife should be ground, 
or whet up on an oil-stone. Any large fork, with a guard 
to prevent accidents, will do. A rest for the knife and fork 
when not in use is desirable. The carver's requisites, there- 
fore, are as follows : A high chair, suitable serving plates, 
two sharp knives, a good fork, and a knife and fork rest 
With these he is ready for work. Without them he is at 
serious disadvantage. 




CARVING. 273 

Carving a Turkey. — Nothing delights an expert carver 
more than the opportunity to cut up a fine roast turkey. 
Such a man is in doubt whether the eating of the meat even 
is the greater luxury. 

Whether the head of the bird shall lie to the carver'^ 
right or left is an open question. Better to the right, as 
more work is required on the head end, and in this position 
the knife-hand works less over the hand which holds the 
fork. 

The fork should be inserted astride of the breast-bone, 
just back of its most promi- 
nent point. It should be 
sunk deep enough to pene- 
trate the encasing bone be- 
low the white meat. This 
secures full command of the 

bird. If the company be TU R KEy properly trussed for 
small and the bird fairly roasting. 

large, better do all the cutting from one side, reserving the 
otner in as perfect a form as possible. 

Remove all the limbs first unless half the bird is to be 
reserved. The neat cut is to remove each drum-stick, or 
lower leg, by a single stroke of the knife, which must ex- 
actly hit the joint. To remove the thigh, or upper leg 
joint, make a V-shaped cut, wide enough at the point whence 
the drum-stick has been cut to include all the meat, but 
converging at the joint, which can always be distinctly seen 
near the back. Two strokes of the knife do this work, each 
of them cutting down to the carcase. A slight outward 
pressure of the knife-blade, applied between the carcase and 
the upper point of the thigh joint, will cause it to drop 
off neatly on the plate. Outside the lines of these cuts, flakes 
of dark meat will remain adhering to the carcase, which 
should now be cut off. They help to meet demands for 
daA'k meat. 



274 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

In carving the wings, the neat stroke removes the lower 
part, which contains the two bones, by cutting at the inner 
part of the joint, and so turning the blade of the knife as 
to throw that part off in the direction opposite to its natural 
movement. The first joint of each wing then follows, the 
cut being deep enough to fully reach the ball and socket 
joint. A slight motion of the pinion toward the head of the 
bird will suffice usually to detach this part. If it does not, 
the point of the knife may be thrust into the socket of the 
joint to sever the cartilage. This will free it. 

When this dismembering is accomplished, proceed to 
slice the breast meat in thin, broad slices. Clean off all the 
white meat, unless part only is needed. Placing your knife 
close to the front of the breast-bone, and cutting toward the 
neck, you will dislodge the V-shaped bone, corresponding 
to the " merrythought " or " pull-bone " of chickens. To 
dislodge the collar-bones is to many a hard task. But cut 
the cartilages which bind them to the frame of the bird. 
These cartilages are in the cavity between the neck and the 
breast-bone. Through, this cavity, thrust your knife out- 
wardly under one of these bones ; make a fulcrum of the 
front part of breast-bone, and a lever of the knife, its edge 
resting on the fulcrum. You can then easily pry up the 
troublesome bone and turn it off to the side. This move- 
ment takes the bone at the best mechanical advantage. It 
must come, and come at once, if this movement be made. 

Now attend to the other end of the bird. Shave off all 
superfluous meat from the carcase. Turn the carcase on its 
side, the back toward you. Insert your knife beside the oil- 
bag and thrust it forward parallel to the spine. It will cut 
its way very easily. A slight outward movement of the 
knife will then throw off these side bones, which are choice 
pieces, yielding the juiciest of the dark meat. The ribs 
may now be cut through with ease from front to rear, about 
midway from breast to back. The breast-bone is incapable 




CARVING. 275 

of further division, but the back easily divides into six parts. 
Turn it back up and hold with the fork ; separate the oil- 
bag, about an inch of the spine with it ; lift the 
projecting spine with the knife back and it will 
break readily, carrying one rib with it. Cut off 
from each side of the remaining spine the rib 
parts adherent to it; then divide the remaining 
spine just back of the neck. 

An entire drum-stick, or second joint, need not 
be served to any one person, but had better be 
divided among several. A fair-sized turkey 
divided on the above method will furnish a good * 
supply for twenty people. fowl. 

It will be asked, however, how can one become r< *' *' '! n<: P* 

easy break- 

so expert in hitting these joints? Frequently age. a,c, e . 
the carver tries, and tries again, but tries in vain, j^ es o ' f *' £ 
to strike the right place for his knife. There is rationofside- 
one way only to succeed in this art. The anatomy tX^b pot-' 
of the turkey or chicken, or any other animal, must a ° n - 
be carefully studied. Do it in this way. Whenever a tur- 
key is brought into your house and is made ready for the 
roasting, place it on its back, as it will lie on the plate when 
it comes to the table. Carefully manipulate it, and note 
exactly where every joint lies. Imagine yourself about to 
carve it. Where would you put the knife to throw off that 
drum-stick ? How would you cut to throw off the thigh 
bone. Read the preceding directions ; apply them in fancy 
to the bird as you see and handle it ; then carry it all out at 
the table when the bird is cooked. 

No surgeon could do his work except he had thus prac- 
ticed on actual subjects in dissection. He must know by 
actual trial just what to do and how to do it. So must the 
carver know. Chickens, ducks, geese, small birds, meat, 
roasting pigs, every article, in short, which he expects to carve 
must be understood beforehand; then success will be his.

Carving Roast Chicken. — The same course precisely as has 
been prescribed for carving turkey must 
be followed with chickens. The only 
difference is in the formation of the 
" pull-bone " or " merrythought," but 
this makes no difference whatever in the 
cutting of the bird.

Carving Roast Ducks and Geese. — These 
are more -difficult than turkey or chick- 
ens, for the reason that they are constitu- 
tionally more sinewy in the joints and 
they have far less flesh proportionately. 

They are barrel-shaped, 
with thin layers of meat 
instead of the fine 
masses of flesh found 
on the turkey or on fine 
chickens. The leg joints 
lie farther to the rear, 
and higher on the side 
than in land fowls. They are not so easily reached, therefore 
Their anatomy must be 
studied, however. It is the 
only way to obtain com- 
mand of the carcase. In 
carving, dismember the 
bird as in other cases. 
Then cut the meat in long, 
narrow strips, along the 
sides and breast of the bird, 
and use these as the choice 
cuts. The legs and wings 
may be given out if desired or if the supply be short. Duck

other dishes, and so to be served lightly. Goose is some- 
times the main piece, but not often so at elaborate feasts. 

Carving Broiled Chickens. — Chickens for broiling are pre- 
sumably young and tender. If not, thorough steaming before 
they are broiled will do something for them. They are 
trussed in such shape usually that joints are not easily 
struck. But study the bird when trussed. See where joints 
do lie and cut them. If the birds are really young and ten- 
der, however, they may be halved or quartered, cutting 
through the bones directly and so serving them. 

Carving Smaller Birds. — Smaller 
birds which need carving, may 
simply be split longitudinally, just 
beside the breast-bone and the 
spine. Their bones can be cut 
easily. This will apply to pigeon, 
partridge, prairie hen, pheasant, smaller bird properl-v

etc. 

Carving Roast Bee£ — Pieces of roast beef vary so that no 
one rule covers all. A safe general direction, however, is 
to study carefully just what is in the piece before it is 
cooked. Know your meat before you attempt to carve it. 
Another general rule, applicable to all meats indeed, is to 
cut across the grain in all cases. Meat cut with the grain 
is stringy and fibrous. If cut across the grain, all the longi- 
tudinal flakes of flesh and the minute sinews are cut so 
short that any toughness existing in them is wholly con- 
cealed. The first slice, by this process, will always be a 
brown, outside cut. Slices should always be thin v but not 
so as to seem ragged. In carving ribs of beef the knife 
may be thrust along close to the ribs, so as to separate the 
meat from them. The cuts then made across the grain will 
separate the slices with ease and neatness. Never cut beef 
across the bone. It is the easiest way, but also the poorest

Carving Rcasts of Mutton. — A leg of mutton is carved as a 
ham, by cutting down to the bone, from the outer edge, 
making the cuts converge on the bone, so freeing each slice 
as it is cut. 

A shoulder of mutton should be carved as the leg. In 
each case,, when the choice cuts are exhausted, clip off the 
remaining meat as best you can, always across the grain. 

Saddle of mutton is carved in several ways: 1st, in longi- ■ 
tudinal slices along the backbone ; 2d, by transverse slices, 
each taking in a rib, which makes thick and clumsy por- 
tions ; 3d, by oblique slices, not taking in the bones, but 
forming a slight angle with them. The latter method is 
deemed preferable by most carvers. 

In all roasts which include the ribs the backbone should 

be well and cleanly cut through by the butcher, between every 

pair of ribs. Otherwise no satisfactory carving can be done. 

Carving Roasts of Lamb. — The cut shows a fore-quarter of 

lamb with its outer side uppermost. This joint is first to 

be cut so as to divide the 
shoulder from the rest ol 
the quarter, which is called 
the target. For this pur- 
pose, put the fork firmly 
into the shoulder joint, and 
then cut underneath the 
blade-bone, beginning at a, 

FORE-QUARTER OF LAMB. and coht i nue cutting all 

around in the direction of the circular line, and pretty close 
to the under part of the blade-bone. Some cut the shoulder 
large, while others take off no more meat with it than is 
barely necessary to remove the blade-bone. It is most con- 
venient to place the shoulder on a separate dish. This is 
carved in the same way as the shoulder of mutton. When 
the shoulder is removed, a lemon may be squeezed over 
rhat part of the remainder of the joint where the knife hai

passed ; this gives a flavor to the meat which is generally 
approved. Then proceed to cut completely through from 
b to c, following the line across the bones as cracked by the 
butcher, and this will divide the ribs (d) from the brisket {/). 
Tastes vary in giving preference to the, ribs or the brisket. 

Other parts of lamb are carved as mutton. The fat is 
very delicate and should be served to all the guests. 

Carving Roasts of Venison. — These resemble roasts of 
mutton so closely that no different directions for their carv- 
ing need be given. 

Carving Ham. — Boiled or baked ham may be served either 
side up. The inner edge of the ham, which lay adjacent to 
the body, is rather more tender than the edge, which lay 
toward the tail. Slices should be cut directly from the edge 
to the bone, cutting out the middle portions first. Let the 
cuts converge upon the bone every time, so that each slice 
is set free at once. When the choice cuts are gone, trim up 
the remaining parts neatly as possible, and always across 
the grain. The knuckle end of a ham furnishes the leaner 
and drier cuts. Some prefer carving hams with a more 
slanting cut, rather than a direct, right-angled cut upon the 
bone, beginning at the thick end, and so continuing through^ 
out. This mode is, however, apt to be very wasteful, unless 
the carver be careful to take away both fat and lean in due 
proportion. 

Carving Roast Pig. — The cut below represents a pig roasted 
whole and served in the most 
approved style. Many, how- 
ever, separate the head before 
serving, and garnish the body 
with the ears, jaw, etc. The 
head may be severed by a 
neat cut around the neck, and a little sideward motion, but 
this is not necessary, as the cheek or jaw can be removed

without removing the head. The shoulder should then be 
taken off from the body, by passing the knife under it in a 
circular direction, and the leg separated as shown in the 
line d, e,f. The ribs may then be divided into two or more 
parts, helping at the same time an ear or jaw with it, with 
some of the sauce also. Pieces may be cut from the legs 
and shoulders. Some consider the neck end the finest part, 
while others give the ribs the preference. 

Carving Roast Rabbit. — Begin by cutting longitudinally 
jrom head to tail near to the backbone, then make a corres- 
ponding cut on the other side of the backbone, leaving the 
back and the head in one distinct piece. Cut off the legs 
at the hip-joint, and take off the wing, or fore leg, nearly as 
you would the wing of a bird, carrying the knife round in a 

circular line. The ribs 
are of little importance, 
as they are bare of meat. 
Divide the back into 
three or four equal por- 
tions. The head is then 
to be cut off, and the 
lower jaw divided from

head in the middle, you have the brains, which are prized

of a rabbit will depend much on the age, and also upon 
the cooking. The back and the legs are always the best 
parts. 




XXV SERVING MEALS. 

methods of serving meals; russian, english, french, and 
american styles; tables, table-cloths, napkins, and 
decorations j finger-bowls ; due ceremony ; what to 
avoid; garnishes; royal displays. 

METHODS of serving meals differ widely. The items 
of conveniences and pecuniary ability always become 
important elements in the case. Taste, too, enters 
largely into it. 

Square end tables are now the proper style. They should 
be sufficiently roomy to wholly avoid crowding. A spot- 
lessly white table-cloth should be spread, with padding 
under it to deaden sound and make a softer appearance. 
The cloth should not be very stiffly starched, but it should 
be nicely polished and beautifully glossy. It should hang 
two feet from the top edge, the corners gathered up, if needs 
be, to prevent their drooping on the floor. Napkins should 
be large and heavy. Such texture does not need much 
starch. The glass and silverware should be perfect in 
brightness. It may be of inexpensive kind, but it must be 
scrupulously clean. 

Colored table-cloths of ornamental patterns are allowable 
for luncheon or tea. They are not in place where hot meats 
are served. Nor are colored napkins. Too often these 
deep tinted articles are used "to save washing," which 
means " to conceal dirt." Not unfrequently covers and nap- 
kins of this kind are kept in use when their rank odor cries 
out for the wash-tub, even though their soiled appearance 
does not. The doily, or DOiley, as some will have it from 
the proper name of its first reputed maker, is a small, colored 
napkin used with fruits and wines. Stains will not show so 
readily upon these, but they must always be scrupulously 
fresh and clean. To conceal filth under rich coloring is 
sacrilege of the worst sort, but to bring it to the table, and 
ask guests to wipe their lips with it, is a crime. 



232 . THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

A great variety of ornaments and adornments are admis- 
sible on a table, but nothing is so pure and so appropriate 
as a handsome display of ferns or flowers. The flowers 
should not be just such as ladies wear so profusely and so 
beautifully in their belts and on their dresses. Larger blooms 
are preferable for the table, especially those of the pure white 
and fine texture belonging to the lily family. 

It is quite the proper and beautiful thing to place a neat 
bouquet beside each plate, in tasteful bouquet-holders. For 
gentlemen the little bunching suitable for the button-hole is 
desirable. For ladies the belt bouquet will meet the case. 
The floral centre-piece may be composed of small bouquets, 
which at the end of the meal may be distributed. 

Fruit pieces and handsome confectionery pieces may be 
disposed to advantage in ornamenting the table. Tasty 
folding of spotless napkins is so important a decoration that 
the subject will be treated fully farther on. These may be 
perched in polished goblets, while bouquets, or small rolls 
of bread nestle amid their snowy folds. Little arts like 
these embellish a table, and delight the guests. 

But these embellishments must not be overdone. What 
will be correct for a large table will be too much for a small 
one, and what will be just right for a small table will look 
thin and meagre on a large one. Study the proprieties of 
every occasion. What suits once does not suit forever. 

Embellishments may be liberally bestowed upon the din- 
ing-room itself. In addition to its permanent decorations, 
flowers are always admissible. At the great ball on March 
20th, 1883, at the Vanderbilt Mansion in New York, the 
decorations of the supper-room were absolutely regal. The 
walls were completely hidden with palms and ferns, from 
which a countless number of orchids were suspended. Two 
large fountains were introduced into the far corners of the 
room. The doors of the main entrance to the supper-room 
were in an ooen position and were completely covered with 



SEJ? VING MEALS. 283 

roses and lilies of the valley. In the centre of the room a 
large palm towered almost to the ceiling, and about it from 
the dome was suspended an immense Bougen Villa vine, the 
tendrils of which drooped in bunches from the branches of 
the palm. Throughout the room there were many stands 
and vases filled with flowers, the entire effect more 
resembling fairyland than an earthly home. Few can rival 
such a display, of course, but all enjoy at least a pen-peep 
upon such princely splendor. 

No ornament should be so large as to obscure to any 
great extent a view of the entire table, or to conceal any of 
its guests. As many knives, forks, and spoons as will be 
needed for the various courses may be placed at each plate, 
though, to avoid the display of so much cutlery, a better 
style is to supply these accessories as needed. Goblets and 
wine-glasses, if the latter be used, should be on the table at 
the start. Large spoons, with salt and pepper casters, 
should be on the table also. The dessert-plates, finger^ 
bowls, etc., should stand ready on the sideboard, awaiting 
the time when they shall be needed. The hot closet should 
be well stocked with dishes needing to be used warm. 

Finger-bowls should be half filled with water. In Paris they 
are served with warm water scented with peppermint. A 
slice of lemon in cold water answers the purpose entirely, as 
it removes any grease from fingers or lips. A geranium 
leaf may flo^t in the water. Its fragrance on the fingers, if 
it be pressed, will be agreeable. It is customary to place a 
fruit napkin, or doily, on the dish on which the finger-bowl 
rests, to avoid the rattle of the bowl, and to protect the dish 
from injury if it be highly ornamented. Little openworked 
mats will, however, answer better. Do not summon your 
company to dinner by a bell. Country hot§ls ai^cl cheap 
boarding-houses may do that, but not a refined home, espe- 
cially when guests are present. 

Soup is dished by the lady of the house at a home dinner. 



284 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Meat is cut and dished by the gentleman of the house 
Vegetables, bread, butter, water, etc., are served by the 
waiter, dessert by the hostess, except in the case of melons, 
requiring to be cut at the table, which is the work of the 
host. 

Home meals should all be sufficiently ceremonious to 
dispense with haste and confusion. On the other hand, they 
should not run into stiffness and frigidity. Bright, cheery, 
pleasant chat should enliven every meal. If the leading dish 
be nothing but hash, let it be served in good style and amid 
a profusion of genial, social sunshine. 

What to Avoid. 

1st. — Never use table-linen which is open to the suspicion 
of being soiled. The napkin-ring business is of question- 
able propriety. Why not, as at hotels, furnish a clean nap- 
kin to each person at every meal ? 

2d. — Crockery with an abundance of nicks and splints 
and cracks is not unsightly merely, but, where the glazing 
is broken, the porous material absorbs grease and dish water, 
making these spots dense with unsavory and unwholesome 
matter. 

3d. — Partly emptied dishes become unsightly, and some- 
times positively repulsive. They look like refuse and scraps. 
At the great State dinners at the Tuileries, no guest saw a 
partly emptied dish. A full, beautifully garnished dish was 
presented for his approval, upon expressing which, his per- 
sonal plate was taken to a side table and supplied from 
another serving dish. 

4th. — An overloaded table or plate satiates appetite 
rather than stimulates it. A gracious expectancy of what 
is to come is a great help at the table. 

5th. — A stinted supply is very discouraging. To the ap- 
prehension of a lack of food, the moral sense of mortification 
ts added in this case. 



SERVING MEALS. 285 

6th. — Beware of ill-assorted dinners or tea-parties. An 
occasion intended to be a pleasure is often a pest for lack of 
care in this regard. This caution applies to the selection of 
guests, and more strongly to the disposition of guests at the 
table. Secure fitness both in the viands presented and in 
the parties present. 

7th. — Do not inaugurate new features at a dinner party, 
unless you are sure you have the mastery of them, and that, 
when done in a masterly way they will certainly prove 
agreeable. 

8th. — Beware of the delusion that hospitality is expressed 
by the weight of its beef and mutton, and the multitude and 
rarity of its viands. 

9th. — Have no meddlesome, noisy, or slovenly service. 
Waiters should be attired neatly, and should wear light 
shoes or slippers. They should take no part in the social 
proceedings, not so much, indeed, as to smile at the best 
things. On formal occasions the man-servant should wear 
a dress-coat, white vest, and white necktie. The maid» 
servant should be attired in a neat, inconspicuous dress, 
with spotless white apron. 

10th. — Both haste and slowness should be shunned. At 
the finished French dinners, the courses will not average 
*nore than five minutes each. French waiters are marvel- 
ously expert, however, in removing and replacing dishes. 

Garnishes. 

Much of the attractiveness of a table depends on the 
garnishes, which are added to certain dishes to embellish or 
beautify them. A few hints on this subject will be of value. 

Parsley is the almost universal garnish to all kinds of 
cold meat, poultry, fish, butter, cheese, etc. 

Horse-radish is the garnish for roast beef, and for fish in 
general ; for the latter, slices of lemon are sometimes laid 
alternately with heaps of horse-radish.

FOREWORD. 



IN no department of industry has the last century 
brought greater changes than in the department of 
housekeeping. Then, the housekeeper was at the 
head of, and the principal worker in, a manufacturing 
plant in which was made nearly everything used by the 
family. The housewife made with her own hands the 
candles for lighting and the soap for cleaning. The 
flax was taken as it came from the field and the wool as 
it came from the sheep, and all the processes 6i spin- 
ning, weaving, knitting, bleaching, dj-eing and making 
the cloth into clothes for all the members of the family, 
and the linen for the table or bed, were carried on by 
the women of the household. Then the housekeeper 
took the grain as it came fron) the field and the fruit as 
it came from the vine and tree, and attended to all the 
steps by which it was converted into food. 

To-day all this is changed. While food has still to 
undergo some measure of preparation within the house- 
hold, and while there are still a sufficiency of duties for 
the housekeeper, the work has been greatly simplified 
and made easier by the invention of many labor-saving 
devices, appliances and processes. 

In a civilized community the position of housekeeper 
will always be first in importance to the well-being of 
the famity, and the duties of the housekeeper are com- 
ing more and more to be the spending of a definite 
amount of money for a great variety of ready-prepared 



30 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY, 

articles, the most successful housekeeper being the one 
who can spend the money to the greatest advantage. 

Competition is daily becoming more strenuous and 
the claims of manufacturers and dealers more pictur- 
esque. The unscrupulous will adulterate their goods 
and sell an inferior article for the sake of the larger 
profit, and it is of the greatest importance to the house- 
keeper to know what are standard goods and where 
they can be obtained. The housekeeper who is led to 
spend money for inferior goods, or to deal with irre- 
sponsible concerns, lowers the standard of living of the 
whole family. 

For this reason the publishers of The New England 
Cook Book have introduced a department of *' Sup- 
plies, Furnishings, etc.," which is a feature never before 
attempted. We have investigated the claims of manu- 
facturers of and dealers in goods that are used by the 
housewife or the members of the family, and, having 
satisfied ourselves as to the excellence of the goods 
offered and the reliability of the manufacturers and 
dealers, we have allowed them to state in their own way 
their claims for recognition. 

We can assure the readers of The New England 
Cook Book that the articles here described are of the 
highest quality as to material and manufacture, that the 
individuals and firms here represented are of unques- 
tioned reliability, and that the use of the goods here 
described, or the patronage of the houses referred to, 
will insure the certainty of getting the very best that the 
market affords.

I.— THE ART OF COOKING. 

THERE is a science and there is an art of cooking. The 
science tells what should be done and why ; the art takes 
hold and does the thing, without, in most cases, knowing 
any reason why certain methods produce certain results. 
The one is theoretical, the other practical ; the one deals 
with principles, the other with performances. 

The science of cookery proceeds on- the basis that man 
needs certain elements of repair and growth for the various 
tissues of his body, that these elements exist in nature in 
various fojms, and that the mission of the cook is so to 
prepare these suitable substances that man may receive 
them in their most enjoyable and assimilable forms, and thus 
have his waste repaired and his growth provided for. This 
basis is solid. On it the whole culinary system is founded. 
But, from the merely utilitarian idea of repairing waste and 
supplying force, cookery rises to the supreme height of 
exquisitely delighting the taste while doing its most impor- 
tant work of feeding the body. Indeed, the art of cooking 
well, and of serving well-cooked victuals welL, is ** a fine art " 
in the best sense of the term. There are artistes in 
this line. Meals may be served artistically. They may 
become a delight to the most refined natures and a real 
benefaction to both body and soul. 

The great aim of all cooking is to retain all the valuable 
elements of the food, and to put them into such forms as 
shall awake desire, stimulate digestion, and secure to the 
eater, in the readiest and most pleasing way, all the nutriment 
these viands afford. For instance, in cooking meats it is 
desirable to retain all the natural juices. To this end, when 
meat is to be boiled it should be plunged into hot water, 
which at once renders the outer part measurably impenetra- 



^4 THE HO USE WIFE S L IBRAR Y. 

ble, ana so confines the juices. On the other hand, if the 
juices are to be drawn out for the production of soup, it 
must be placed in cold water, and gradually warmed and 
slowly boiled, so as to allow the exudation of the juices. 
On the same principle, broiling and roasting, by quickly clos- 
ing the surface of the meat, retain the juices as well as the 
odors, and make the meat both juicy and savory. The re- 
tention of the fatty substances renders such preparations 
somewhat less digestible, however, than boiled food or lean 
meat. 

High art in cookery, as elsewhere, demands high rates of 
expenditure. Instructions on that grade alone would not 
meet the want of American homes. But high aims in this 
department are equally commendable with high aims else- 
where. So important a factor in domestic economy as cook- 
ing cannot be ignored and should not be treated lightly. 
Good food, well cooked and well served, goes far to make 
home happy and its inmates healthy. 

The chemical aspect of food and cooking may be left to 
the chemist and the physiologist. They will perfect the 
scientific aspects of the case. But the art of cooking, which 
teaches just how and when to do the right things, is for us 
to learn and to practice day by day. Such is the relation of 
stomach and brain on the one side, and of stomach and 
cook on the other side, that the cook becomes the sov- 
ereign, to whom many a brain mightier than his own 
bows in servile allegiance. 

What cookery was practiced in the garden of Eden his- 
tory does not tell. Vegetarians insist that permission to 
eat animal food was not given until after the flood (Genesis 
xi, 3, 4), when, by indulgence, man's appetites had become 
abnormal. If vegetable food only were used in Eden, and 
that mainly of the nature of fruits, but little cooking was 
needed, and the simplest forms would suffice amply.

II.— SOUP STOCK, SOUPS, ETC 

GENERAL SUGGESTIONS ON SOUP STOCK AND SOUP MEAT, HOW 
TO PREPARE THEM, HOW TO ENRICH THEM, THICKENING SOUP, 
COLORING SOUP, FLAVORING SOUP, ETC. THIRTY-FIVE RECIPES 
FOR SOUPS AND INCIDENTAL PREPARATIONS. 

THE first and great essential to making good soup is 
stocky or good, fi-esh meat. To make stock, take the 
liquor left after boiling fi-esh meat, bones large or 
small, the large ones being cracked, that the marrow may 
be extracted, trimmings of meat, bones, and meat left over 
from a roast or broil, put any or all of these in a large pot 
or soup-kettle with water enough to cover thern. Let them 
simmer slowly over a steady fire, keep the kettle covered, 
stir frequently, pour in now and then a cup of cold water, 
and skim off the scum. If it is fresh meat or bones, com- 
mence with cold water ; if cooked, with warm water. Bones 
are as useful as meat in making stock, as they furnish gela- 
tine. A quart of water is usually enough for a pound of 
meat. Six to eight hours will make stock fit for use. Let 
it stand over night, then skim off the fat, put the stock into 
an earthen jar, and it is ready for use. 

Fresh meat should be freed from all superfluous skin and 
fat, which make a soup greasy, rathef than rich. 

The glutinous substance contained in the bones renders it 
important that they should be boiled with the meat, as they 
add to the strength and thickness of the soup. The meat, 
however, should be cut off the bone and divided into small 
pieces. Place in cold water over a gentle fire and boil by 
the long and slow process, that the essence of the meat may 

35 



86 THE HOUSE WIFE'S LIBRAE Y. 

be drawn out thoroughly. When it comes to the boiling 
point, throw in a little salt to assist the scum to rise ; then 
skim carefully to prevent its becoming turbid. When no 
more scum accumulates, and the meat is softened so as to 
readily separate with the use of the fork, it should be 
strained, the vegetables put it, the seasoning done, and the 
necessary amount of hot water added if too much has boiled 
away. 

All soup meats are better boiled the day before using, so 
as to allow the grease to chill over night, when it can 
readily be removed before putting over the fire again. 

The following thickening is almost indispensable to all 
good soups : A tablespoonful or more of flour mixed to a 
smooth paste with a little water, and enriched with a tea- 
spoonful of butter, or good beef drippings well stirred in. 
If it be necessary to add water to a soup, always use boil- 
ing water, as cold water injures the flavor. If making a 
rich soup that requires catsup or wine, let either be added 
just before the soup is taken from the fire. 

Soup may be colored yellow by the use of grated car- 
rots ; red with the juice of tomatoes ;" green with the juice 
of powdered spinach ; brown with carefully scorohed flour, 
kept ready for use. Onions are thought by many to be a 
necessity in all soups — that their flavor must lurk some- 
where, either defined or undefined. Their flavor may be 
much improved if fried until nicely browned in hot butter 
before being added to the soup. Potatoes should never 
be boiled with soup, because they add nothing to its flavor 
and are themselves injured by the long cooking. They 
should be boiled separately, and then added. 

A most desirable quality in soup is that no one flavor 
predominate over the others, but, that by a careful blending 
of the different ingredients it shall contain and harmonize 
all flavors. Soups and broths should always be strained. It

makes them more relishable as well as inviting to the eye. 
A slight acid, like lemon or tomato, gives a peculiar 
relish to some soups, as do many of the palatable condi- 
ments prepared by such manufacturers as Skilton & 
Foote Co., D. & L. Slade Co., and several others, for 
this especial purpose. With such helps and a suffi- 
cient quantity of stock on hand, a choice, rich soup of 
any variety may be gotten up in thirty minutes. 



RECIPES. 

Beef Soup. — Boil a shin of beef, or a piece off the shoulder, 
slowly and thoroughly, the day before desiring to use it ; 
skim well the next day and thin the jelly, if necessary, with 
water ; add a little brandy, a grated carrot, two tablespoon- 
fuls of butter rubbed smooth in brown flour, a little vermi- 
celli, and spices to taste. Two or three eggs may be boiled 
hard, mashed smooth, and placed in the tureen before 
turning in the soup. 

Beef Soup, No. 2. — Boil a shin of beef of moderate size, 
crack the bone, remove the tough outside skin, wash, and 
place in a kettle to boil with six or eight quarts of water. 
Let it boil about four hours, until it becomes perfectly 
tender, then take it out of the liquid. Add salt, one pint of 
tomatoes, two onions cut in small pieces, two turnips cut in 
quarters, one grated carrot, one large tablespoonful of sugar, 
a little sweet marjoram and thyme rubbed fine, one red 
pepper cut in very small pieces, also a celery top or a small 
quantity of bruised celery seed. This soup may be thick- 
ened according to taste either with vermicelli, macaroni, 
noodles, or drop dumplings. 

For an incidental side dish, take the soup meat that has 
been cut from the bones, chop fine while warm, season with 
salt and pepper, add one teacup of soup saved out before 



3g THE II G USE WIFE'S LIBRAR V. 

putting in the vegetables. Pack in a dish, and sHce down 
for tea or lunch when cold. 

Beef Soup witli Okra. — Cut a round steak in small pieces 
and fry in three tablespoonfuls of butter, together with one 
sliced onion, until very brown ; put into a soup kettle witli 
four quarts of cold water, and boil slowly an hour ; add 
salt, pepper, and one pint of sliced okra, and simmer three 
and one-half hours longer. Strain before serving. 

Comed Beef Soup. — When the liquor in which corned beef 
and vegetables have been boiled is cold, remove all the 
grease that has risen and hardened on the top, and add 
tomatoes and tomato catsup and boil half an hour — thus 
making an excellent tomato soup ; or add to it rice, or sago, 
or pearl barley, or turn it into a vegetable soup by boiling in 
the liquor any vegetables that are fancied. Several varieties 
of soups may have this stock for a basis and be agreeable 
to the taste. 

Ox-tail Soup. — Chop the ox-tail into small pieces ; set on 
the fire with a tablespoonful of butter, and stir until brown, 
and then pour off the fat; add broth to taste, and boil gently 
until the pieces of tail are well cooked. Season with pepper, 
salt, and tliree or four tomatoes ; boil fifteen minutes and 
then serve. This soup can be made with water, instead of 
the stock broth, in which case season with carrot, onion, 
turnip, and parsley. 

Mutton Brotk — After the steaks have been cut from the 
leg, the lower part is just adapted for a soup. The neck- 
piece is also very nice. Boil the meat very gently in cold 
water, adding a turnip, a carrot, and a spoonful of rice. All 
the fat should be removed. Toward the last, add a little 
minced parsley. Dumplings are an excellent addition. 

Vegetable Soup. — Take two pounds of shin of beef and two 
pounds of knuckle of veal ; remove all the fat and break 



SOUP STOCK, SOUPS, ETC. g9 

the bones and take out the marrow ; put into a pot with five 
pints of water ; add a teaspoonful of salt, and then cover and 
let it come to a boil quickly ; remove the scum that rises, 
and set where it will simmer for five hours ; one hour before 
serving, add two young carrots, scraped and cut in slices, 
half a head of celery, and a small onion cut into squares ; in 
half an hour add one turnip sliced, and in fifteen minutes 
one cauliflower broken in small pieces. 

Bean Soup. — Soak one and a half pints of beans in cold 
water over night. In the morning drain off the water, wash 
the beans in fresh water, and put into soup-kettle with four 
quarts of good beef stock, from which all the fat has been 
removed. Set it where it will boil slowly but steadily for 
three hours at the least. Two hours before it is needed for 
use, slice in an onion and a carrot. Some think it im- 
proved by adding a little tomato. If the beans are not liked 
whole, strain through a colander and send to the table hot. 

Black Bean Soup. — Three pounds soup bone, one quart 
black beans, soaked over night and drained; one onion, 
chopped fine ; j nice of one lemon. Pepper, salt, and Durkee's 
Challenge Sauce to taste. Boil the soup bone, beans, and 
onions together six hours ; strain, and add seasoning. Slice 
lemon and put on top when served. 

Tomato Soup. — Take a knuckle of veal, a bony piece of 
beef, a neck of mutton, or almost any piece of meat you . 
may happen to have ; set it over the fire in a small quantity' 
of water, cover it closely, and boil very gently, to extract 
the juices of the meat. When nearly done, add a quantity 
of peeled tomatoes, and stew till the tomatoes are done ; add 
salt and pepper to your taste. This is a very cheap, healthful, 
and easily made soup. 

Tomato Soup, No. 2. — Take one quart of tomatoes. When 
boiling, add one teaspoonful of soda, two pulverized soda 



40 THE HOUSEWIFE S LIBRARY. ■ 

crackers, one pint of hot water, one pint of milk, salt, and 
pepper ; strain through a colander and serve hot. 

Green Pea Soup. — Boil the empty pods of a half-peck of 
green peas in one gallon of water one hour ; strain them 
out ; add four pounds of beef cut into small pieces, and boil 
slowly for an hour and a half longer. Half an hour before 
serving add the shelled peas, and twenty minutes later half 
a cup of rice flour, salt, pepper, and a little chopped parsley. 
After adding the rice flour stir frequently so as to pre- 
vent scorching. 

Dried Split Pea Soup. — One gallon of water, one quart of 
soaked split peas, half a pound of salt pork, one pound of 
beef Put over the fire, seasoning with salt and pepper, 
celery salt, salpicant, curry powder, marjoram, or savory; 
let it boil slowly for two hours, or until the quantity of 
liquor does not exceed two quarts. Pour into a colander 
and press the peas through with a spoon. Fry two or three 
slices of stale bread in butter till brown, scatter them in the 
soup after it is placed in the tureen. 

Com Soup. — Cut the corn from the cob, and to a pint of 
com allow one quart of hot water ; boil an hour and press 
through a colander; put into a saucepan an ounce of but- 
ter and a tablespoonful of flour, being careful to stir well to 
prevent it being lumpy; then add the corn pulp, a little 
cayenne pepper, salt, a pint of boiling milk, and half a pint 
of cream. 

Onion Soup. — Slice ten medium-sized onions and fry brown 
in butter with a tablespoonful and a half of flour ; put into a 
saucepan, and stir in slowly four or five pints of milk and 
water (about one-third water) ; season to taste, and add a 
teacupful of grated potato ; set in a kettle of boiling water, 
and cook ten minutes ; add a cup of sweet cream and serve 
quickly. 



^OUP STOCK, SOUPS, ETC. 41 

Mock-turtle Soup. — Scald a calf's head and wash it clean ; 
boil it in a large pot of water for half an hour, cut all the 
skin off, and take the tongue out. Take the broth made of 
a knuckle of veal, put in the tongue and skin, with one 
onion, half-ounce of cloves, half-ounce of mace, half a nut- 
meg, all kinds of sweet herbs chopped fine, and three 
anchovies. Stew till tender ; then take out the meat, and 
cut it in pieces two inches square ; cut the tongue,previously 
skinned, in slices ; strain the liquor through a sieve ; melt 
lialf a pound of butter in a stewpan ; put in it half a pound 
of flour and stir it till smooth — if at all lumpy, strain it; add 
the liquor, stirring it all the time ; then put to the meat the 
juice of two lemons, or one bottle of Madeira wine, if pre- 
ferred ; season rather highly with pepper, salt, and cayenne 
pepper ; put in a few meat balls and eight eggs boiled hard. 
Stew gently one hour, and serve in a tureen ; if too thick, 
add more liquor before stewing the last time. 

Mock-tui'tle Soup. No. 2. — Take a calf's head and about 
two pounds of delicate fat pork. Put both into a soup- 
kettle, with two onions, sweet herbs, celery, pepper, and 
mace. Fill the kettle with water, and boil very gently till 
the meat is tender. Take out the head and the pork, return 
the bones of the head into the soup ; let it stew several 
hours longer ; and, when cold, take off the fat, strain the 
soup, and thicken; add the juice of a lemon and half a pint 
of white wine. Cut up the head and pork into pieces ; warm 
them up in the soup, adding some choice meat balls made 
from finely minced, savory meat. The pork will be found 
quite an addition to the soup and a substitute for the fat of 
the turtle. 

Gumbo Soup. — Cut up two chickens, two slices of ham, and 
two onions into dice ; flour them, and fry the whole to a 
light brown ; then fill the frying-pan with boiling water, stir 



42 THE HO USE WIFE' S LIB EAR K 

it a few minutes, and turn the whole into a saucepan con- 
taining three quarts of boiling water ; let it boil forty min- 
utes, removing the scum. In the meantime soak three pods 
of okra in cold water twenty minutes ; cut them into thin 
slices, and add to the other ingredients ; let it boil one hour 
and a half Add a quart of canned tomatoes and a cupful 
of boiled rice half an hour before serving. 

Southern Guinbo Soup. — Cut up one chicken, and fry it to 
a light brown, also two slices of bacon ; pour on them three 
quarts of boiling water ; add one onion and some sweet 
herbs tied in a bag ; simmer them gently three hours and a 
half; strain off the liquor, take off the fat, and then put the 
ham and chicken (cut into small pieces) into the liquor ; 
add half a teacup of sliced okra, also half a teacup of boiled 
rice. Boil all half an hour, and just before serving add a 
glass of wine and a dozen oysters with their juice. 

Julienne Soup. — Scrape two carrots and two turnips, and 
cut in pieces an inch long ; cut slices lengthwise about one- 
eighth of an inch thick; then cut again, so as to make 
square strips ; put them in a saucepan, with two ounces of 
butter, three tablespoonfuls of cabbage chopped fine, and 
half an onion chopped ; set on the fire and stir until half 
fried ; add broth as you wish to make thick or thin ; boil 
until done ; salt to taste ; skim off the fat, and serve ; it 
takes about two hours to prepare this soup properly. It 
can be served with rice or barley. 

Macaroni or Vermicelli Soup. — Two small carrots, four 
onions, two turnips, two cloves, one tablespoonful salt, pep- 
per to taste. Herbs — marjoram, parsley, and thyme. Put 
any cooked or uncooked meat and its bones in enough water 
to cover them; when they boil, skim them and add the 
vegetables. Simmer three or four hours, then strain 
through a colander and put back in the saucepan to reheat. 



SOUP STOCK, SOUPS, ETC. 43 

Boil one-half pound macaroni until quite tender, and place 
in the soup tureen, and pour the soup over it — the last 
thing. Vermicelli will need to be soaked a short time only — 
not to be boiled. 

WMte Sonp. — Boil a knuckle of veal for three hours. Add 
a quarter of a pound of macaroni, and when done, a pint of 
cream. Season with lemon-peel and mace. 

Turkey Soup. — Take the turkey bones and boil three- 
quarters of an hour in water enough to cover them ; add a 
little summer savory and celery chopped fine. Just before 
serving, thicken with a little brov/ned flour, and season 
with pepper, salt, and a small piece of butter. 

CMcken Soup. — To the broth in which chickens have been 
boiled for salad, etc., add one onion and eight or ten 
tomatoes ; season with pepper and salt ; add Challenge Sauce 
or Salpicant, if desired ; boil thirty minutes ; add two well- 
beaten eggs just before sending to the table. 

Lobster Soup. — To boil a lobster, put it in a fish-kettle and 
cover it with cold water, cooking it on a quick fire. Remove 
the small bladder found near the head, and take out a small 
vein found immediately under the shell all along the back 
of the lobster, and use the rest. Two lobsters will make 
soup for six or eight persons, and salad also. All the under 
shell and small claws are pounded in a mortar to make the 
soup ; when pounded, put it into a pan and set it on the fire 
with broth or water. The meat is cut in small pieces, to 
be added afterward. The soup is left on the fire to boil 
gently for half an hour ; then put it in a sieve and press it 
with a masher to extract the juice. To make it thicker, a 
small piece of parsnip can be added and mashed with the 
rest into a pan, so that all the essence is extracted in that way 
from the lobster. When you have strained it put a little 



44 THE HO USE wife: s librae t, 

butter with it and add as much broth as is required ; put 
some of the meat in the tureen and pour the soup over it. 

Clam Soup. — Wash the clams free from grit; boil them in 
a pint of water till they will come from the shells easily. 
Take a small quantity of the liquor, add some milk, thicken 
it with a little flour, and add the clams. Split crackers are 
very nice added. 

Portable Soup. — Boil a knuckle of veal, also the feet, a 
shin of beef, a cowheel or any other bones of meat which 
will produce a stiff jelly, in a large kettle, with as much 
water as will cover them. Let it stand a long time over the 
fire before it boils. Skim it most thoroughly, until the 
broth appears entirely clear. Then fill up the kettle with 
hot water, and boil it eight hours, or until it has evaporated 
so as to be somewhat thick. Run it through a hair sieve, 
set it in a cool place where it will harden very quickly. Skim 
off every particle of fat, and return it to a saucepan ; skim 
and stir continually, so that it may not scorch, and all the 
previous labor be lost, until it becomes a very thick syrup. 
As soon as it can be no longer done in this way, transfer it 
to a deep jar, and set into a kettle of water, hot, but not 
boiling, until it jellies very thick. This will keep good 
many months, if packed dry in tin canisters. This is the con- 
centrated essence of soup, and is a most convenient article 
of use, either at home in an emergency or in traveling, and 
especially at sea. To make a pint of soup, cut off a piece 
as large as a walnut, dissolve it in the boiling water, and it 
is ready for use. 

Fluid Beef. — Among the advanced preparations of the day 
meat extracts are taking a high place. One of the finest of 
these preparations is *' Armour's Fluid Beef" It contains 
all the nutritive constituents of the beef, and is readily 
available for soups, sandwiches, beef tea, etc. For medi- 
cal uses, traveling, picnics, etc,, it is very convenient. To 



SOUP STOCK, SOUPS, ETC. 45 

use for soups and beef tea, add a teaspoonful to a cup of 
boiling water and season to taste ; or as a sandwich paste, 
it may be used on toast, with or without butter. Put up 
in cans of various sizes, from two ounces to one pound, 
which can be left open without injury to contents. 

RECIPES INCIDENTAL TO SOUPS. 

Meat Balls for Soup. — Take fresh cooked meat or fowl and 
chop fine ; season with pepper, salt, and herbs, and a little 
lemon ; mix together with an ^%% \ roll in bread-crumbs, 
and fry in hot lard. 

Browned Flour for Soups. — Dredge the bottom of a spider 
well with flour, and shake it over hot coals, letting it brown 
gradually, but not burn. Keep it in a dry place, in a tin 
canister, without wholly closing the lid. It is very con- 
venient to have it already prepared, although when used fresh 
it is much nicer. 

Home-made Noodles — a substitute for Vermicelli. — Wet with 
the yelks of four eggs as much fine, dry, sifted flour as will 
make them into a firm but very smooth paste. Roll it out 
as thin as possible, and cut it into bands of about an inch 
and a quarter in width. Dust them lightly with flour, and 
place four of them one upon the other. Cut them in the 
finest possible strips, separate them with the point of a 
knife, and spread them on the pie-board so that they may 
dry a little before they are used. Drop them gradually into 
the boiling soup, and in five minutes they will be done. 

Drop Dumplings. — Take prepared flour, add a little beef 
drippings or lard, well rubbed through, and moisten to a soft 
dough. With floured hands pinch off very small pieces and 
form into balls by rolling in the palm of the hand. In boil- 
ing dumplings of any kind, put them in the water one at a 
time. If they are put in together they will blend with each 
other. 



46 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Clamcakes. — Fried bread crumbs for soups are pre- 
pared in this way : Cut slices of stale home-made bread 
half an inch thick, trim off all crust, and cut each slice 
into squares ; fry these in very hot fat ; drain them on a 
clean napkin, and add six or eight to each portion of 
soup. — Thomas J. Murrey, 

Marrow Dumplings for Soups. — Grate the crust of a 
breakfast roll, and break the remainder into crumbs ; 
soak these in cold milk ; drain, and add two ounces of 
flour; chop up half a pound of beef-marrow freed 
from skin and sinews ; beat up the yolks of five eggs ; 
mix all together thoroughly, if too moist add some of 
the grated crumbs ; salt and pepper to taste ; form into 
small round dumplings ; boil them in the soup for half 
an hour before serving. — Thomas J. Murrey, 

Potage a la Reine. — Remove the fat from one quart of 
the water in which a chicken has been boiled. Season 
highly with salt, pepper and celery-salt, and a little 
onion if desired, and put on to boil. Mash the yolks of 
three hard-boiled eggs fine, and mix them with half a 
cup of bread or cracker crumbs soaked until soft in a 
little milk. Chop the white meat of the chicken until 
fine like meal, and stir it into the ^gg and bread paste. 
Add one pint of hot cream slowly, and then rub all into 
the hot chicken liquor. Boil five minutes, add more 
salt if needed, and if too thick add more cream, or if 
not thick enough add more fine cracker-dust. It should 
be like a puree. — The Boston Cook Book: Mrs. D,

HINTS CONCERNING FISH HOW TO DRESS, HOW TO BOIL FISH, 

HOW TO BAKE FISH, HOW TO BROIL FISH, HOW TO FRY FISH, 
ETC. FIFTY-THREE RECIPES FOR COOKING FISH, OYSTERS, ETC., 
AND FOR INCIDENTAL PREPARATIONS. 

RECIPES. 

Broiled Shad. — Scrape, split, wash, and dry the shad on a 
cloth; season with pepper and salt; grease the gridiron 
well ; as soon as it is hot lay the shad on to broil with the 
inside downward. One side being well browned, turn it. 
It should broil a quarter of an hour or more, according to 
thickness. Butter well and send to table hot. 

Baked Shad. — Many people are of the opinion that the 
very best method of cooking a shad is to bake it. Stuff it 
with bread-crumbs, salt, pepper, butter, and parsley, and 
mix this up with beaten yelk of egg ; fill the fish with it, 
and sew it up or fasten a string around it. Pour over it a 
little water and some butter, and bake as you would a fowl. 
A shad will require from an hour to an hour and a quarter 
to bake. 

Halibut Cutlets.— Cut your halibut steaks an inch thick, 
wipe them with a dry cloth, and season with salt and cay- 
enne pepper. Have ready a pan of yelk of eggs well 
beaten and a dish of grated bread-crumbs. Put some fresh 



48 THE HOUSE WIFE'S LIBRAR Y. 

lard or beef drippings in a fr>4ng-pan and hold it over the 
fire till it boils. Dip your cutlets in the ^%%y and then in 
the bread-crumbs. Fiy a light brown; serve up hot. 
Salmon or any large fish may be fried in the same manner. 

Baked Cod or Halibut — Use a piece of fish from the middle 
of the back, weighing four, five, or six pounds. Lay the fish 
in very cold salt-and-water for two hours ; wipe dry ; make 
deep gashes in both sides at right angles with the back- 
bone, and rub into these, as well as coat it all over with, a 
force-meat made of the crumbs, pork, herbs, onion, and 
seasoning, made to adhere by raw ^g^. Lay in the baking- 
pan and pour over it the drawn butter (which should be quite 
thin), season with tlie anchovy sauce, lemon juice, pepper, 
and a pinch of parsley. Bake in a moderate oven nearly an 
hour-— or even more if the piece be large — basting frequently 
lest it should brown too fast. Add a little butter-and-water 
when the sauce thickens too much. When the fish is done, 
remove to a hot dish, and strain the gravy over it. A few 
capers or chopped green pickles are a pleasant addition to 
the gravy. 

Boiled Halibnt. — Take a small halibut, or what you require 
from a lar^re fish. Put it into the fish-kettle, with the back 
of the fish undermost ; cover it with cold water, in which a 
handful of salt and a bit of saltpetre the size of a hazel-nut 
have been dissolved. When it begins to boil skim it care- 
fully, and then let it just simmer till it is done. Four pounds 
of fish will require half an hour nearly to boil it. Drain it, 
garnish with horse-radish or parsley. Egg sauce, or plain 
melted butter, are served with it. 

Boiled EocMsh. — After the fish has been nicely cleaned, 
put it into a pot v/ith water enough to cover it, and throw 
in salt in the proportion of half a teaspoonful to a pound of 
fish. Boil it slowly until the meat is tender and easily sep- 



FISH, OYSTERS, ETC. 49 

arates from the bones. A large fish will require an hour to 
cook. When done, serve on a hot dish, and have a few 
hard-boiled eggs, cut in thin slices, laid around it and over 
it. Eat with egg-sauce. 

Wliite FisL — This fish may be broiled, fried, or balced. 
To bake it, prepare a stuffing of fine bread-crumbs, a little 
salt pork chopped very fine ; season with sage, parsley, pep- 
per, and salt. Fill the fish with the stuffing, sew it up, 
sprinkle the outside with salt, pepper, and flour, and bake. 
In frying white fish, pour off the fat as it accumulates, as it 
is apt to be too fat when served. 

Broiled Salmon. — The steaks from the centre of the fish 
are best. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, spread on a little 
butter, and broil over a clear but slow fire. 

Smoked Salmon, Broiled. — Take a half pound of smoked 
salmon and parboil it ten minutes ; lay in cold water for the 
same length of time ; wipe dry and broil over a clear fire. 
Add two tablespoonfuls of butter while hot ; season with 
cayenne and the juice of half a lemon; pile in a "log- 
cabin " square upon a hot plate, and serve with dry toast. 

Boiled Salmon. — A piece weighing six pounds should be 
rubbed with salt, tied carefully in a cloth, and boiled slowly 
for three-quarters of an hour. It should be eaten with ^g% or 
caper sauce. If any remain after dinner, it may be placed 
in a deep dish, a little salt sprinkled over, and a teacupful of 
boiling vinegar poured upon it. Cover it closely, and it will 
make a nice breakfast dish. 

Baked Salmon witli Cream Sance. — Butter a sheet of fools- 
cap paper on both sides, and wrap the fish up in it, pinning 
the ends securely together. Lay in the baking-pan, and 
pour six or seven spoonfuls of butter-and-water over it. 
Turn another pan over all, and steam in a moderate oveo

90 THE HOUSEIVIFE'S LIBRARY, 

from three-quarters of an nour to an hour, lifting the cover, 
from time to time, to baste and assure yourself that the 
paper is not burning. Meanwhile, have ready in a sauce- 
pan a cup of cream, in which you would do well to dis- 
solve a bit of soda a little larger than a pea. This is a wise 
precaution whenever cream is to be boiled. Heat this in a 
vessel placed within another of hot water ; thicken with a 
heaping teaspoonful of corn-starch ; add a tablespoonful of 
butter, pepper and salt to taste, a liberal pinch of minced 
parsley, and when the fish is unwrapped and dished, pour 
half the dressing slowly over it, sending the rest to table 
in a boat. If you have no cream, use milk, and add a beaten 
egg to the thickening. 

Sahnon Steaks or Cutlets Fried. — Cut slices from the middle 
of the fish one inch thick ; wipe dry, and salt slightly ; dip 
in ^^%, then in cracker crumbs ; fry very quickly in hot 
butter ; drain off every drop of grease, and serve upon a hot 
dish. Sprinkle green parsley in bunches over it. The 
French use the best salad-oil in this recipe instead of butter. 

Pickled Salmon. — Soak salt salmon twenty-four hours, 
changing the water frequently ; afterward pour boiling water 
around it, and let it stand fifteen minutes ; drain off and 
then pour on boiling vinegar with cloves and mace added. 

Pried PercL — Scale and clean them perfectly ; dry them 
well, flour and fry them in boiling lard. Serve plenty of 
fried parsley round them. 

Fried Trout. — Wash, drain, and split ; roll in flour, season 
with salt; have some thin slices of salt pork in a pan, and 
when very hot put in the fish and fry to a nice brown. 

Stewed Trout — Clean and wash the fish with care, and 
wipe it perfectly dry ; put into a stewpan two tablespoonfuls 
of butter, dredge in as it melts a little flour, grate half a 



FISH, OYSTERS, ETC. 51 

nutmeg, a few blades of mace, a little cayenne, and a tea- 
spoonful of salt ; mix it all together ; then lay in the fish, let 
it brown slightly; pour over some veal gravy, a lemon 
thinly sliced ; stew very slowly for forty minutes ; take out 
the fish, and add two glasses of wine to the gravy. Lay 
the fish on a hot dish, and pour over it some of the gravy. 
Serve the rest in a sauce-tureen. 

Fried Catfish. — Catfish must be cooked quite fresh — if pos- 
sible, directly out of the water. The larger ones are gener- 
ally coarse and strong ; the small-sized fish are the best. 
Wash and clean them, cut off their heads and tails, remove 
the upper part of the backbone near the shoulders, and 
score them along the back with deep gashes or incisions. 
Dredge them with flour, and fry them in plenty of lard, 
boiling fast when the catfish are put into the pan. Or you 
may fry them in the drippings or gravy saved from roast 
beef or veal. They are very nice dipped in a batter of 
beaten ^^^ and grated bread-crumbs, or they may be done 
plain, though not in so nice a way, with Indian meal instead 
of bread-crumbs. Drain off the lard before you dish them. 
Touch each incision or cut very slightly with a little cay- 
enne before they go to table. 

Pried Eels. — After skinning, emptying, and washing them 
as clean as possible, cut them into short pieces, and dry 
them well with a soft cloth. Season them with fine salt 
and cayenne, flour them thickly, and fry them in boiling 
lard ; when nicely browned, drain and dry them, and send 
to the table with plain melted butter and a lemon, or with 
fish-sauce. Eels are sometimes dipped into batter and then 
fried, or into t^^ and dried bread-crumbs, and served with 
plent>^ of crisped parsley 

Fish Chowder. — Take a fresh haddock, of three or four 
pounds, clean it well, and cut in pieces of three inches 



52 THE no USE WIFE' S L IBRAR Y. 

square. Place in the bottom of your dinner-pot five or six 
slices of salt pork, fry brown, then add three onions sliced 
thin, and fry those brown. Remove the kettle from the fire, 
and place on the onions and pork a layer of fish. Sprinkle 
over a little pepper and salt, then a layer of pared and sliced 
potatoes, a layer of fish and potatoes, till the fish is used up. 
Cover with water, and let it boil for half an hour. Pound 
six biscuits or crackers fine as meal, and pour into the pot ; 
and, lastly, add a pint of milk ; let it scald well, and serve. 

New England Chowder. — Take a good haddock, cod, or any 
other solid fish, cut it in pieces three inches square ; put a 
pound of fat, salt pork, cut into strips, into the pot ; set it 
on hot coals and fry out the grease ; take out the pork, but 
leave the grease in the bottom of the pot, and put in a layer 
of fish, over that a layer of sliced onions, over that a layer 
of fish, with slips of the fried pork, then another layer of 
onions and a few sliced raw potatoes, and so on alternately 
until your fish is all in ; mix some flour with as much water 
as will fill the pot ; season to suit your taste, and boil for 
half an hour; have ready some pilot bread, soaked in water, 
and throw them into your chowder five minutes before tak- 
ing off; serve in a tur-een. 

Fish-balls. — Two cupfuls cold boiled codfish, fresh or 
salted. Chop the fish when you have freed it of bones and 
skin ; work in one cupful of mashed potatoes, and moisten 
with a half cup of drawn butter with an ^^^ beaten in. Sea- 
son to taste. Have them soft enough to mold, yet firm 
enough to keep in shape. Roll the balls in flour, and fry 
quickly to a golden-brown in lard or clean dripping. Take 
from the fat so soon as they are done ; lay in a colander or 
sieve and shake gently, to free them from every drop of 
grease. Turn out for moment on white paper to absorb any 
lingering drops, and serve on a hot dish. 



FISH, OYSTERS, ETC. 53 

Lobster Chowder. — Meat of one fine lobster, picked 
out from the shell and cut into bits, one quart of milk, 
six Boston crackers split and buttered, one even tea- 
spoonful of salt, one scant quarter-teaspoonful of cay- 
enne, two tablespoonfuls of butter rolled i-n one of pre- 
pared flour, a pinch of soda in the milk. Scald the 
milk, and stir in seasoning, butter, and flour, cook one 
minute, add the lobster, and simmer five minutes. Line 
a tureen v^ith the toasted and buttered crackers, dipping 
each quickly in boiling water before putting it in place, 
and pour in the chowder. — Afcwton Harland. 

Clam Scallops. — Chop fifty clams fine, and drain off 
in a colander all the liquor that will come away. Mix 
this in a bowl with a cupful of crushed cracker , half a 
cupful of milk, two beaten eggs, a tablespoonful melted 
butter, half a teaspoonful of salt, a pinch of mace and 
the same of cayenne pepper. Beat into this the chopped 
clams and fill with the mixture, clam-shells, or the silver 
or stone-china shell-shaped dishes sold for this purpose. 
Bake to a light brown in a quick oven and serve in the 
shells. Serve with sliced lemon. — Marion Harland, 

Little Pigs in Blankets. — Season large oysters with salt 
and pepper. Cut bacon in very thin slices ; wrap an 
oyster in each slice, and fasten with a little wooden 
skewer. Heat a frying-pan and put in the ** little 
pigs." Cook just long enough to crisp the bacon. 
Place on slices of toast that have been cut into small 
pieces and serve immediately. Do not remove the 
skewers. This is a nice relish for lunch or tea ; and, 
garnished with parsley, is a pretty one. The pan must 
be very hot before the ''pigs" are put in. Great care 
must be taken that they do not burn. — New Cook Book :

Roasted Oysters. — Take oysters in the shell; wash the 
shells clean, and lay them on hot coals ; when they are done 
they will begin to open. Remove the upper shell, and serve 
the oysters in the lower shell, with a little melted butter 
poured over each, and season to taste. 

Oyster Toast. — Select fifteen plump oysters; mince them, 
and season with mixed pepper and a pinch of nutmeg ; beat 
the yelks of four eggs and mix them with half a pint of 
cream. Put the whole into a saucepan and set it over the 
fire to simmer till thick ; stir it well, and do not let it boil, 
lest it should curdle. Toast five pieces of bread, and butter 
them ; when your dish is near the boiling-point, remove it 
from the fire and pour it over the toast. 

Cream Oysters.— Fifty shell oysters, one quart sweet cream ; 
butter, pepper, and salt to suit taste. Put the cream and 
oysters in separate kettles to heat, the oysters in their own 
liquor, and let them come to a boil; when sufficiently 
cooked, skim ; then take them out of the liquid and put 
them into a dish to keep warm. Put the cream and 
liquid together. Season to taste, and thicken with powdered 
cracker. When sufficiently thick, stir in the oysters. 

Broiled Oysters. — Drain select oysters in a colander. Dip 
them one by one into melted butter, to prevent sticking to 
the gridiron, and place them on a wire gridiron. Broil over 
a clear fire. When nicely browned on both sides, season 
with salt, pepper, and plenty of butter, and lay them on hot 
buttered toast, moistened with a little hot water. Serve 
very hot. Oysters cooked in this way and served on broiled 
beefsteak are delicious. 

Pried Oysters. — Select the largest and finest fresh oysters, 
put them into a colander and pour over a little water to 
rinse them ; then place them on a ciean towel and dry them. 
Have ready some grated bread-crumbs seasoned with 



FISH, OYSTERS, ETC, 55 

pepper and salt, and plenty of yelk of ^^'g beaten till very 
light ; and to each ^'gg allow a large teaspoonful of rich 
cream or of the best fresh butter. Beat the ^gg and cream 
together. Dip each oyster first into the ^g<g and cream, 
and then into the crumbs. Repeat this twice, until the 
oysters are well coated all over. Have ready boiling, in a 
frying-pan, an equal mixture of fresh butter and lard. It 
must very nearly fill the frying-pan, and be boiling fast when 
the oysters go in, otherwise they will be heavy and greasy. 
Fry them of a yellow brown on both sides, and serve hot. 

Oyster Salad, see Salads. 

Spiced or Pickled Oysters. — Put into a porcelain kettle one 
hundred and fifty large oysters with the liquor ; add salt, 
and simmer till the edges roll or curl ; skim them out ; add 
to the liquor one pint of white wine vinegar, one dozen 
blades mace, three dozen cloves, and three dozen pepper- 
corns ; let it come to a boil, and pour over the oysters. 
Serve with slices of lemon floating in saucer. 

Oyster Omelette. — Allow for every six large oysters or 
twelve small ones one ^%g ; remove the hard part and mince 
the rest very fine ; take the yelks of eight eggs and whites of 
four, beat till very light, then mix in the oysters ; season and 
beat up thoroughly ; put into a skillet a gill of butter, let it 
melt ; when the butter boils, skim it and turn in the ome- 
lette ; stir until it stiffens ; fry light brown ; when the under 
side is brown, turn on to a hot platter. To brown the upper 
side, hold a red-hot shovel over it. 

Scalloped Oysters, No. 1. — Open the shells, setting aside for 
use the deepest ones. Have ready some melted butter, not 
hot, seasoned with minced parsley and pepper. Roll each 
oyster in this, letting it drip as little as may be, and lay in 
the shells,which should be arranged in a baking-pan. Add 



56 THE HO USE WIFE S LIBRAR r. 

to each a little lemon juice, sift bread-crumbs over it, and 
bake in a quick oven until done. Serve in the shells. 

Scalloped Oysters, No. 2. — Cover the bottom of a baking- 
dish (well buttered) with a layer of crumbs, and wet these 
with cream, put on spoonful by spoonful. Pepper and salt, 
and strew with minute bits of butter. Next, put in the oys- 
ters, with a little of their liquor. Pepper them, stick bits of 
butter in among them, and cover with dry crumbs until the 
oysters are entirely hidden. Add more pieces of butter, very 
small, and arrange thickly on top. Set in the oven, invert 
a plate over it to keep in the flavor, and bake until the juice 
bubbles up to the top. Remove the cover, and brown on 
the upper grating for two or three minutes. Serve in the 
bake-dish. 

Oyster Pie. — Line a dish with a puff paste or a rich bis- 
cuit paste, and dredge' well with flour; drain one quart of 
oysters ; season with pepper, salt, and butter, and pour into 
the dish ; add some of the liquor ; dredge with flour, and 
cover with a top crust, leaving a small opening in the 
centre. Bake in a quick oven. 

Oyster Patties. — Put one quart of oysters in a saucepan, 
with liquor enough to cover them, set it on the stove and 
let them come to a boil ; skim well, and stir in tv/o table- 
spoonfuls of butter, a little pepper, and salt. Line some 
patty-pans with puff-paste, fill with oysters, cover with paste, 
and bake t\venty minutes in a hot oven. The upper crust 
may be omitted, if desired. 

Oyster Macaroni. — Boil macaroni in a cloth to keep it 
straight. Put a layer in a dish seasoned with pepper, salt, 
and butter, then a layer of oysters, until the dish is full. 
Mix some grated bread with a beaten q^^, spread over the 
top, and bake. 

Oyster Sauce, see Sauces. 



FISH, OYSTERS, ETC. 57 

Boiled Lobster. — If purchased alive, lobsters should be 
chosen by weight (the heaviest are the best) and their live- 
liness and briskness of motion. When freshly boiled they 
are stiff, and their tails turn strongly inward ; when the fish 
appear soft and watery, they are stale. The flesh of the 
male lobster is generally considered of the finest flavor for 
eating, but the hen lobster is preferred for sauce and soups, 
on account of the coral. 

To properly boil lobsters, throw them living into a kettle 
of fast-boiling salt and water, that life may be destroyed in 
an instant. Let them boil for about half an hour. When 
done, take them out of the kettle, v/ipe them clean, and rub 
the shell with a little salad-oil, which will give a clear red 
appearance. Crack the large claws without mashing them, 
and with a sharp knife split the body and tail from end to 
end. The head, which is never eaten, should also be sepa- 
rated from the body, but laid so near it that the division is 
almost imperceptible. Dress in any way preferred. 

" Deviled Lobster. — Procure a live, heavy lobster ; put it in 
a pot of boiling water, with a handful of salt to it. When 
done and cold, take out all the meat carefully, puttino- the 
fat and coral on separate plates; cut the meat in small 
pieces, rub the coral to a paste ; stir the fat in it, with a little 
salt, cayenne, chopped parsley, essence of anchovies, and 
salad-oil, or melted butter and lemon juice ; cut the back of 
the lobster-shell in two, lengthwise ; wash clean ; stir the 
lobster and sauce well together; fill the shells; sprinkle 
bread-crumbs and a few bits of butter over the top ; set in 
the oven until the crumbs are brown. 

Stewed Lobster. — A middling-sized lobster is best; pick 
all the meat from the shells and mince it fine ; season with 
a little salt, pepper, and grated nutmeg ; add three or four 
spoonfuls of rich gravy and a small bit of butter. If you 



53 THE HO USE WIFE' S LIBRAR Y. 

have no gravy, use more butter and two spoonfuls of 
vinegar ; stew about twenty minutes. 

Lobster Salad, see Salads. 

Lobster Croquettes, see Croquettes. ^ 

Lobster Sauce, see Sauces. 

Lobster Patties. — Proceed as in oyster patties, but use the 
meat of a cold boiled lobster. 

Terrapins. — Put the terrapins into a pot of boiling water, 
where they must remain until they are quite dead. You 
then divest them of their outer skin and toe-nails ; and, 
after washing them in warm water, boil them again until 
they become quite tender, adding a handful of salt to the 
water. Having satisfied yourself of their being perfectly 
tender, take off the shells and clean the terrapins very care- 
fully, removing the sandbag and gall without by any means 
breaking them. Then cut the meat into small pieces and put 
into a saucepan, adding the juice which has been given out 
in cutting them up, but no water, and season v/ith salt, cay- 
enne, and black pepper to your taste, adding a quarter of 
a pound of good butter for each terrapin and a handful ol 
flour for thickening. After stirring a short time, add four 
or five tablespoonfuls of cream, and a half pint of good 
Maderia to every four terrapins, and serve hot in a deep 
dish. A very little mace may be added and a large table- 
spoonful of mustard; just before serving, add the yelks of 
four hard-boiled eggs. During the stewing^ particular 
attention must be paid to stirring the preparation frequently; 
and terrapins cannot possibly be served too hot. 

Mock Terrapin. — Take half a calf's IVer, season and fry it 
brown ; chop it into dice, not too small ; flour it thickly, 
and add a teaspoonful of mJxed mustard, a little cayenne 
pepper, two hard-boiled eggs chopped fine, a lump of but-

ter the size of an Qgg, and a teacupful of water. Let it boil 
a minute or two. Cold veal will do as well as liver. 

Scalloped Crabs.— Put the crabs into a kettle of boiling 
water, and throw in a handful of salt. Boil from twenty 
minutes to half an hour. Take them from the water when 
done and pick out all the meat ; be careful not to break the 
shell. To a pint of meat put a little salt and pepper ; taste, 
and if not enough add more, a little at a time, till suited. 
Grate in a very little nutmeg, and add one spoonful of 
cracker or bread crumbs, two eggs well beaten, and two 
tablespoonfuls of butter (even full) ; stir all well together ; 
wash the shells clean, and fill each shell full of the m^ixture ; 
sprinkle crumbs over the top and moisten with butter, then 
bake until nicely browned on top. 

Soft-shell Crabs. — Season with pepper and salt; roll in 
flour, then in tgg, then in bread-crumbs, and fry in hot 
lard. Serve hot with rich condiments. 

Stewed Clams. — Chop the clams and season with peppet 
and salt; put in a saucepan butter the size of an ^gg, and 
when melted add a teaspoonful of flour; add slowly the 
clam liquor and then the clams, and cook three minutes ; 
then add half a pint of cream, and serve. 

Deviled Clams. — Chop fifty clams very fine ; take two 
tomatoes, one onion chopped equally fine, a little parsley, 
thyme, and sweet marjoram, a little salt, pepper, and bread- 
crumbs, adding the juice of the clams until the mixture is 
of the consistency of sausage ; put it in the shells with a 
lump of butter on each ; cover with bread-crumbs, and bake 
one-half hour. 

Clam Chowder. — Forty-five clams chopped, one quart of 
sliced potatoes, one-half pint sliced onions. Cut a few slices 
salt pork, fry to a crisp, chop fine. Put in kettle a little fat 



60 "^HE HOUSE WIPES LIBRAR Y. 

from the pork, a layer of potatoes, clams, onions, a little pep- 
per and salt ; another layer of chopped pork, potatoes, etc., 
until all are in. Pour over all the juice of the clams. Cook 
three hours, being careful not to burn. Add a teacupful of 
milk just before serving. 

Scallops. — Wipe dry; dip separately into seasoned egg, 
then into cracker dust, and fry in hot lard. 

RECIPES INCIDENTAL TO FISH. 

Bread Stufiliig for FisL — Take about half a pound of stale 
bread and soak in water, and when soft press out the water; 
add a very little chopped suet, pepper, salt, a large table- 
spoonful of onion minced and fried, and, if preferred, a little 
minced parsley ; cook a trifle, and after removing from the 
fire add a beaten ^^'g. 

Bread Stuffing, No. 2. — Bread-crumbs with a little chopped 
parsley and pork, salt, pepper, and butter. Fill up the fish, 
sew it closely, then bake. 

Cleaning a Shad. — Scale and scrape it carefully; split it 
down the back and remove the contents, reserving the roe 
or melt. Wash well and cook as desired. 

Soaking Salt Fish. — Very salt fish should be soaked several 
hours in three or four changes of warm water. Place the 
skin side up, so that salt crystals may fall away from the 
under or meat side. Wipe carefully and clean, then soak 
for an hour in very cold water. 

Fish in Season. — As a rule, fish are in best condition just 
before they spawn, and many are so while they are full of 
roe, as smelts, mackerel, and shad. As soon as spawning is 
over, they become unfit for food, some of them becoming 
positively unwholesome. In season, the flesh is firm and it 
boils white ; when it boils to a bluish hue, the fish are not 
in season, or are stale.

RECIPES. 

Roast Turkey. — A young turkey, weighing not more than 
eight or nine pounds, is the best. Wash and clean thor- 
oughly, wiping dry, as moisture will spoil the stuffing. 
Take one small loaf of bread grated fine, rub into it a piece 
of butter the size of an Ggg, one small teaspoonful of pep- 
per and one of salt; a sprinkling of sweet marjoram, sum- 
mer savory, or sage, if liked. Rub all together, and fill the 
turkey, sewing up so that the stuffing cannot cook out. 
Always put the giblets under the side of the fowl, so they 
will not dry up. Rub salt, pepper, and butter on the out- 
side ; put into dripping-pan with one teacupful of water, 
basting often, turning the fowl till brown all over ; bake 
about two hours ; take out the giblets and chop fine. After 
taking out the turkey, put a large tablespoonful of flour into 
the pan and stir until brown. Put the giblets into a gravy- 
boat, and pour over them the gravy. 

Boiled Turkey. — Stuff the turkey as for roasting. A very 
nice dressing is made by chopping half a pint of oysters 
and mixing them with bread-crumbs, butter, pepper, salt, 
thyme, and wet with milk or water. Baste about the turkey 
a thin cloth, the inside of which has been dredged with 
flour, and put it to boil in cold water with a teaspoonful of salt

in it. Let a large turkey simmer for three hours; skim 
while boiling. Serve with oyster sauce, made by adding to 
a cupful of the liquor in which the turkey was boiled the 
same quantity of milk and eight oysters chopped fine ; sea- 
son with minced parsley ; stir in a spoonful of rice or wheat 
flour wet with cold milk ; a tablespoonful of butter. Boil 
up once and pour into a tureen. 

Boned Turkey. — Boil a large tu-rkey in as little water as 
possible until the meat falls from the bones ; remove all the 
bones and skin ; pick the meat into small pieces, and mix 
dark and light together ; season with pepper and salt ; put 
into a mold and pour over it the liquor, which must be kept 
warm, and press with a heavy weight. 

Roast Chicken. — Having selected your chickens in view of 
the foregoing hints, proceed, in the matters of cleansing, 
filling, and preparing for the oven, precisely as directed in 
the case of roast turkey. As the roasting goes on, baste 
and turn as may be needful to secure a rich brown all over 
the fowls. Prepare the gravy as in the former case. 

Stewed Chicken. — Clean and cut the chicken into joints ; 
put it in a saucepan with the giblets ; stew in just enough 
water to cover it until tender ; season with pepper, salt, and 
butter ; thicken with flour ; boil up once and serve with the 
gravy poured over it. 

Broiled CMcken. — Only young, tender ehickens are nice 
broiled. After cleaning and washing them, split down the 
back, wipe dry, season with salt and pepper, and lay them 
inside down on a hot gridiron over a bed of bright coals. 
Broil until nicely browned and well cooked through, watch- 
ing and turning to prevent burning. If chickens are large, 
steaming them for one-half hour before placing on the grid- 
iron will better insure their being cooked through. 



POULTRY AND GAME, 63 

Chicken Souffle. — Take the white meat of one chicken, 
remove all skin and sinews, chop very fine. Put the 
chopped meat in a skillet or stew-pan, add some white 
sauce, a little chopped parsley ; salt and pepper to taste ; 
stir it until it boils ; allow it to cool a little ; add 3^olks of 
three eggs beaten to a froth, and stir well. Turn into a 
baking-dish or mould which has been well buttered and 
the bottom covered with fine cracker crumbs. Bake in 
a very quick oven. Serve with white sauce. 

Chicken Patties. — Prepare crusts in the same w^ay as 
for tarts. Boil the chicken until tender. Chop the 
meat, but not too fine. Make a gravy out of the water 
in which the chicken was boiled by adding a half-cupful 
of flour and two teaspoonfuls of butter to a quart of 
water. Season with pepper and salt to taste ; put the 
chopped chicken into the gravy, and boil for five min- 
utes, and fill the crusts with it. Don't have the filling 
too thin. Serve at once. 

Potted Pigeon. — Clean the birds and then stuff them 
with a dressing proportioned in following recipe. Sew 
them up and truss them ; boil them for half an hour with 
just water enough to cover them ; take them out and 
drain ; roll in flour and fry brown in pork fat ; make a 
gravy out of the liquid in which they were boiled, thick- 
ened with flour and seasoned to taste ; let the pigeons 
simmer in this gravy for two hours ; serve with the gravy. 

Poultry Dressing. — Toast eight slices of white bread; 
place in a deep dish, add butter the size of an ^^g-, cover 
with hot water to melt butter and make bread of right 
consistency ; add one even teaspoonful of Bell's Spiced 
Seasoning and one even teaspoonful of salt ; mix well 
and stir in one or two raw eggs. 



64 THE HO USE WIFE S LIBRAE K 

Fricasseed CMckens. — Cut them in pieces, and put in the 
stewpan with salt and pepper ; add a little water, and let 
them boil half an hour ; then thicken the gravy with flour ; 
add butter and a little cream, if you have it. Catsup is an 
additional relish to the gravy. 

Smothered Chicken. — Dress your chickens ; wash and let 
them stand in water half an hour to make them white ; cut 
them open at the back ; put into a baking-pan, sprinkle 
salt and pepper over them, putting a lump of butter here 
and there ; cover tightly with another pan the same size, and 
bake one hour ; baste often with butter. 

Fried CMcken. — Prepare the chicken as for stewing ; dry it, 
season with salt and pepper, dredge with flour, and fry 
brown in hot butter or lard ; take it out, drain, and serve 
with Challenge Sauce, or some other savory condiment, or 
pour into the gravy left in the frying-pan a cup of milk, 
thicken with flour, add a little butter, and season with Sal- 
picant; boil once and pour over the chicken, or serve sepa- 
rately. 

Chickens Fried with Rice.— Take two or three chickens, 
cut them up, and half fry them ; then boil half a pint of rice 
in a quart of water, leaving the grains distinct, but not too 
dry ; stir one large tablespoonful of butter in the rice while 
hot ; let five eggs be well beaten into the rice, with a little 
salt, pepper, and nutmeg, if the last is liked ; put the chick- 
ens into a deep dish, and cover with the rice ; brown in an 
oven not too hot. 

Chicken Pie. — Line the sides of a deep pie-dish with a 
good puff paste. Have your chicken cooked, as for a 
fricassee, seasoned with salt and pepper and a little chopped 
parsley. When they are nearly cooked, lay them in a pie- 
dish with half a pound of salt pork cut into small squares, 
and some of the paste also cut into half-inch pieces ; pour 



POULTRY AXD GAME. 65 

\\\ 2l part of the chicken gravy, thicken with a Httle flour, 
and cover the dish with the paste cover. Cut a hole the 
size of a dollar in the cover, and cover it with a piece ol 
dough. When baking, remove this piece occasionally and 
examine the interior. Brush ^^^ over the top crust of the 
pie, and bake in a quick oven. Should the pie become dry 
pour in more of the gravy. Pigeon pie or any other bird 
pie may be made by the above recipe. 

CMcken Pot-pie. — Cut and joint a large chicken. Cover 
with water, and let it boil gently until tender. Season with 
salt and pepper, and thicken the gravy with two tablespoon- 
fuls of flour mixed smooth in a piece of butter the size of 
an ^^^. Have ready nice, light bread dough ; cut with a 
biscuit-cutter about an inch thick ; drop this into the boiling 
gravy, having previously removed the chicken to a hot 
platter; cover, and let them boil from one-half to three- 
quarters of an hour. To ascertain whether they are done, 
stick them with a fork ; if it comes out clean, they are done. 
Lay them on the platter with the chicken, pour over the 
gravy, and serve. 

Pressed CMcken. — Boil three chickens until the meat 
comes off the bones ; then, removing all bones and skin, 
chop the meat, but do not chop very fine ; add a piece 
of butter as large as an ^^^\ salt and pepper to season 
well. Take about a pint of the broth in which the 
chickens were boiled, into which put one-half a box 
of Swampscott Sparkling Gelatine ; when the gelatine 
has dissolved, put back the chopped chicken and cook 
until the broth is evenly absorbed. Pour the w^hole into 
a mould or pan and press under a weight until cold. 
When ready, serve with sliced hard-boiled eggs and 
garnish wdth parsley, water-cress or sliced lemon. Veal 
may be treated in a similar manner. 



66 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Jellied CMcken. — Cook a chicken in boilincr water until 
tender, remove skin and bones, and season to taste, and 
place in mould. Place the bones back in the liquid and 
boil until there is about one quart of liquid left. Add 
one-quarter box Swampscott Sparkling Gelatine and 
the juice of one lemon ; salt and pepper to taste ; strain 
over the chicken and stand in cool place to harden. 

Eoast Goose and Dnck. — A goose should always be par- 
boiled, as it removes the rank taste and makes it more 
palatable. Clean, prepare, and roast the same as turkey, 
only adding to the force-meat a large onion chopped fine. 
Ducks do not require parboiling (unless very old), otherwise 
they are cooked the same as geese. 

Canvas-back Duck. — Having picked, singed, and drawn it 
well, wipe it carefully, so as to have it clean without wash- 
ing. Truss it, leaving the head on, to show its qualit}'\ 
Place it in a moderately hot oven for at least three-quarters 
of an hour ; serve it hot, in its own gravy, on a large chafing- 
dish. Currant jelly should be on the table. 

Roast PigeOils. — Clean, wash, and stuff the same as poultry ; 
lay them in rows in a dripping-pan with a little water. 
Unless they are very fat, baste v%'ith butter until they are 
half done, afterward with their own gravy. 

Roast Snipe.— Clean and truss, but do not stuff Lay in 
rows in the dripping-pan, sprinkle with salt, and baste well 
with butter, then with butter and water. When they begin 
to brown, cut as many slices of bread as there are birds. 
Toast quickly, butter, and lay in the dripping-pan, a bird 
upon each. When the birds are done, serve upon the toast, 
with the gravy poured over it. The toast should lie under 
them while cooking at least five minutes, during which time 
the birds should be basted with melted butter seasoned with 
pepper. The largest snipe will not require above twenty 



POULTRY AND GAME, §7 

minutes to roast. Or, dip an oyster in melted butter, then 
in bread-crumbs, seasoned with pepper and salt, and put in 
each bird before roasting. Small birds are especially de- 
licious cooked in this way. 

Roast Paj:tiidges, Plieasants, or Quails. — Pluck, singe, draw, 
and truss them ; season with salt and pepper ; roast for about 
half an hour in a brisk oven, basting often with butter. 
When done, place oxv a dish together with bread-crumbs 
fried brown and arranged in small heaps. Gravy should be 
served separately in a tureen. 

Quail on Toast. — Qean, wash, slit down the back, sprinkle 
with salt and pepper, and lay them on a gridiron, the inside 
down. Broil slowly; when nicely browned, butter well. 
Serve with cream gravy on toast. Omitting the cream, 
gravy, and toast, you have the ordinary broiled quail. 
Pigeons, woodcock, and small birds may be broiled in the 
same manner, and are delicious and nourishing for invalids. 

Fried Rabbit. — After the rabbit has been thoroughly 
cleaned and washed, put it into boiling water and let it boil 
for about ten minutes ; drain, and when cold, cut it into^ 
joints; dip into beaten egg, and then into fine bread-crumbs, 
seasoned with salt and pepper. When all are ready, fry 
them in butter over a moderate fire fifteen minutes ; thicken 
the gravy with an ounce of butter and a small teaspocnful 
of flour. Serve hot. 

Roast Rabbit. — Dress nicely and fill with a dressing made 
of bread-crumbs, a little onion, sage, pepper, and salt, and a 
small piece of butter ; tie a piece of salj; pork over it ; put 
into a dripping-pan with a little water in a quick oven; 
baste often ; serve with currant jelly. 

Broiled Steaks of Venison. — Heat the gridiron, grease it 
well, lay on the steaks ; broil quickly, without scorching, 



68 T'Zr^ HOUSE WIFE'S LIBRAR Y. 

turning them two or three times; season with salt and 
pepper. Have butter melted in a well-heated platter, into 
which lay steaks, hot from the gridiron, turning them over 
several times in the butter, and serve hot with currant jelly 
on each steak. It is well to set the platter into another 
containing boiling water. 

Game or Poultry in Jelly. — Take a knuckle of veal weighing 
two pounds ; a slice of lean ham ; one shallot, minced ; a 
sprig of thyme and one of parsley ; six pepper-corns (white) 
and one teaspoonful of salt, with three pints of cold water. 
Boil all these together until the liquor is reduced to a pint ; 
strain without squeezing, and set to cool until next day. It 
should then be a firm jelly. Take off every particle of fat. 
Then take one package gelatine, soaked in one cupful cold 
water for three hours ; one tablespoonful of sugar ; two table- 
spoonfuls strained lemon juice, and two tablespoonfuls of 
currant jelly, dissolved in cold water, and strained through 
a muslin cloth. Pour a quart oi boiliiig vjdXQY over the gela- 
tine, stir for a moment, add the jellied " stock," and when 
this is dissolved, add sugar, lemon juice, and coloring. Stir 
until all are mixed and melted together, and strain without 
shaking or squeezing through a flannel bag until quite clear. 
Have ready several hard-boiled eggs, and the remains of 
roast game, roast or boiled poultry, cut in neat, thin slices, 
and salted slightly. Wet a mold with cold water, and 
when the jelly begins to harden, pour some in the bottom. 
Cut the whites of the eggs in pretty shapes — stars, flowers, 
rings, leaves — with a keen penknife, and arrange these on 
the lowest stratum of jelly, which should be thin, that the 
forms may be visible. Add more jelly, and on this lay 
slices of meat, close together. More jelly, and proceed in 
this order until the mold is full. Set in a cool place to 
harden, and then turn out upon a flat dish. A mold with 
smooth, upright sides, is best for this purpose.

then take the Hquor in which they are boiled, thicken with 
flour ; season with salt, pepper, and a little butter ; add the 
giblets and dripping in which the turkey was roasted. 

Plain Stuffing. — Take stale bread, cut off all the crust, rub 
very fine, and pour over it as much melted butter as will 
make it crumble in your hands ; salt and pepper to taste. 
See also under " Roast Turkey." 

Potato Stuffing. — Take two-thirds bread and one-third 
boiled potatoes grated, butter size of an egg, pepper, salt, 
one ^^'g ; mix thoroughly. 

Oyster Stuffing. — By substituting oysters for potatoes in 
the above, you have.oyster filling. See also under '* Boiled

Stuffing for Boiled CMcken. — One cupful of bread-crumbs, 
one tablespoonful of butter, one ^g%, half a teaspoonful of 
salt, and one tablespoonful of sweet marjoram. Mix well; 
stuff and sew in. 

Capons. — Young male fowls, prepared by early gelding, 
and then nicely fattened, are the finest delicacies in the 
poultry line. They may be known by a small head, pale 
comb, which is short and withered, the neck feathers longer 
than usual, smooth legs, and soft, short spurs. They are 
cooked as ordinary chickens. 

Keeping Game. — Game is rendered more tender, and its 
flavor is improved by keeping. If wrapped in a cloth satu- 
rated with equal parts of pyroligneous acid and water, it 
will keep many days. If in danger of tainting, clean, rub 
well with salt, and plunge into boiling water, letting it run 
through them for five minutes ; then hang in a cold place. 
If tainted, put them in new milk over night. Always hang 
them up by the neck.

Dnckling Pot Roast. — This is a very good way to cook 
this very acceptable bird. Put into a shallow xrock a 
thin strip of bacon and a tablespoonful of mixed whole 
spice. Clean and truss two ducklings, put them in the 
crock, add hot water or soup-»stock enough to come up 
half-way on the birds. Then add a sprig of celery and 
two of parsley ; place a narrow strip of bacon over each 
bird; cover close and set the crock in a moderate oven, 
where the birds will cook slowly two hours. Remove 
the ducklings, strain the sauce, and reduce it one-third 
by boiling ; add a gill of dark wine ; thicken with a 
dash of brown flour ; simmer fifteen minutes ; ad4 a 
teaspoonful of lemon-juice and serve with the duck. A 
small quantity of the sauce may be boiled down until 
thick as cream. This is called glaze ; it is brushed 
over the bird before serving. — Tho77ias J. Murrey. 

Fillet of Grouse. — Remove the breast and separate into 
four or six pieces. Disjoint and cook the remainder in 
boiling salted water to cover, till tender ; then remove 
all the meat and chop it fine. Thicken the broth (which 
should be reduced to half a cup), season, and moisten 
the meat. Spread the minced meat on squares of toast ; 
put a layer of currant jelly on each. Rub the fillets 
with butter and broil them carefully ; season with salt, 
pepper and butter, and lay them on the jelly. — The

RECIPES. 

Roast Beef — The best roasting-pieces are the middle ribs 
and the sirloin. The ends of the ribs should be removed 
from the flank, and the latter folded under the beef and 
securely fastened with skewers. Rub a little salt into the 
fat part ; place the meat in the dripping-pan with a pint of 
stock or water ; baste freely, and dredge with flour half an 
hour before taking the joint from the oven. Should the 
oven be very hot, place a buttered paper over the meat to 
prevent it scorching while yet raw. When the paper is 
used it will need very little basting. Or, turn the rib side 
up toward the fire for the first twenty minutes. The time it 
will take in cooking depends upon the thickness of the joint 
and the length of time the animal has been killed. Skim the 
fat from the gravy and add a tablespoonful of prepared 
brown flour to the remainder. 

Roast Beef witli YorksMre Pudding. — Take a large rib 
roast ; rub salt and pepper over it, and dredge with flour. 
Place on a rack in a dripping-pan, with very little water, 
until it is heated thoroughly; baste frequently. When 
nicely browned on the upper side, turn and baste. About 
three-quarters of an hour before it is done, take out the 
meat, pour off most of the dripping, put the batter for the 



72 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY, 

pudding in the bottom of the pan, allowing the drippingii 
from the beef to drop into it. When the pudding is done, 
return the meat and finish roasting. Add some hot water 
t© the dripping and thicken with flour for the gravy. 

For the batter of this pudding, take half a cup of butter, 
three cups of flour, three eggs, one cup of milk, and two 
teaspoonfuls of baking powder. 

Beef a la Mode. — Take a round of fresh beef, extract the 
bone, and take away the fat. For a round weighing ten 
pounds, make a seasoning or stuffing as follows : Half a 
pound of beef suet; half a pound of grated bread-crumbs; 
the crumbled yelks of three hard-boiled eggs; a little 
bundle of sweet marjoram, the leaves chopped; another of 
sweet basil ; four onions minced small; a large tablespoonful 
of mixed mace and nutmeg powdered. Season lightly with 
salt and cayenne. Stuff this mixture into the place from 
whence you took out the bone. Make a number of deep 
cuts about the meat, and stuff them also. Skewer the meai 
into a favorable shape, and secure its form by tying it round 
with tape. Put it into a tin bakepan, and pour over it a 
pint of port wine. Put on the lid, and bake the beef slowly for 
five or six hours, or till it is thoroughly done. If the meat 
is to be eaten hot, skim all the fat from the gravy, into 
which, after it is taken off the fire, stir in the beaten yelks 
of two eggs. Minced oysters maybe substituted for onions. 

Spiced Beef — Boil a shin of beef weighing ten or twelve 
pounds, until the meat falls readily from the bones. Pick 
the meat to pieces, and mash the gristle very fine, rejectinf*' 
all parts that are too hard to mash. Set away the liquor in 
which the beef has boiled till it is cold ; then takeoff all the 
fat. Boil the liquor down to a pint and a half Roll a 
dozen crackers very fine, and add them to the meat. Then 
return the meat to the liquor, and heat it all. Add salt and 
pepper to taste, half a teasooonful of cloves, half a teaspoon- 



MEATS. 73 

ful of cinnamon, half a teaspoonful oi parsley chopped fine, 
and a little powdered nutmeg. Let it boil up once, and put 
into a mold or deep dish, with a weight adjusted to press 
it down. When it is entirely cold, cut into thin slices. 

Savory Beef —Take a shin of beef from the hind-quarter, 
saw it into four pieces, put it into a pot, and boil it until the 
meat and gristle drop from the bones ; chop the meat very 
fine, put it in a dish, and season it with a little salt, pepper, 
clove, and sage, to your taste ; pour in the liquor in which 
the meat was boiled, and place it away to harden. Cut in 
slices and eat cold. 

Minced Beef.— Cut cold roast beef into thin slices; put 
some of the gravy into a stewpan, a bit of butter rolled in 
flour, pepper and salt, and boil it up Add a little catsup, 
and put in the minced slices, and heat them through, but do 
not let it boil. Put small slices of toast in the dish, and 
cover with the meat. 

Deviled Beef.— Take slices of cold roast beef, lay them on 
hot coals, and broil ; season with pepper and salt, and serve 
while hot, with a small lump of butter on each piece. 

Curried Beef.— Take about two ounces of butter and place 
them in a saucepan with two small onions cut up into slices, 
and let them fry till they are of a light brown ; then add a 
tablespoonful and a half of curry powder, and mix it up 
well. Now cut up the beef into pieces about an inch 
square ; pour in from a quarter to a third of a pint of milk, 
and let it simmer for thirty minutes ; then take it off and 
place it in a dish with a little lemon juice. While cooking 
stir constantly, to prevent burning. Send it to table with a 
wall of mashed potatoes or rice around it. 

Beef Hash.— Chop fine cold steak or roast beef, and cook 
in a little water; add cream or milk, and thicken with flour; 
season to taste, and pour over thin slices of toast. 



74 THE HO USE WIFE' S LIBRAR V. 

Beef stew. — Cut cold beef into small pieces, and put into 
cold water ; add one tomato, a little onion, chopped fine ; 
pepper and salt, and cook slowly ; thicken with butter and 
flour, and pour over toast. 

Boiled Corned Beef. — Put four or five pounds of lean corned 
meat into a pot with plenty of water. The water should be 
hot. The same care should be taken in skimming as for 
fresh meat. Allow half an hour for every pound of meat 
after it has begun to boil. The excellence of corned beef 
depends very much upon its being boiled gently and long. 
If it is to be eaten cold, lay it, when boiled, into a coarse 
earthen dish cw: pan, and over it a clean board about the 
size of the meat ; upon this put a heavy weight. Salt meat 
is much improved by pressing. 

Stewed SMn of Beef. — Wash, and set it on to stew in suffi- 
cient cold water to keep it just covered until done. When 
it boils, take off the scum, and put an ounce and a quarter 
of salt to the gallon of water. It is usual to add a few cloves 
and some black pepper, slightly bruised and tied up loosely 
in a fold of muslin, two or more onions, a root of celery, a 
bunch of savory herbs, four or five carrots, and as many 
turnips, either whole or sliced ; if to be served with the 
meat, the last two will require a little more than the ordinary 
time of boiling, but otherwise they may be simmered with 
the meat from the beginning. Give the beef from four to 
five hours' gentle stewing, and serve it with part of its own 
liquor thickened and flavored, or quite plain. 

Boiled Tongue. — Soak the tongue over night, then boil four 
or five hours. Peel off the outer skin and return it to the 
water in which it was boiled to cool. This will render it 
juicy and tender. 

Baked Heart. — Wash carefully and stuff nicely ; roast or 
bake and serve with gravy, which should be thickened with 



MEATS. 75 

some of the stuffing. It is very nice hashed, with a little 
port wine added. 

Broiled Beefeteak. — Have the choice steaks cut three- 
quarters of an inch thick ; grease the gridiron and have it 
well heated. Put the steak over a hot, clear fire. When the 
steak is colored, turn it over, which must be done without 
sticking a fork into it and thus letting out the juice. It 
should be quite rare or pink in the centre, but not raw. 
When cooked sufficiently, lay on a hot platter and season 
with pepper and salt ; spread over the top some small bits of 
butter, and serve immediately. Salt extracts the juices of 
meats in cooking. Steaks ought not to be salted until they 
have been broiled. 

Beefsteak with Onions. — Take a nice rumpsteak, and pound 
it with a rolling-pin until it is quite tender ; flour and season; 
put it into a frying-pan with hot lard and fiy it When 
well browned on both sides,takeitup and dredge with flour. 
Have about two dozen onions ready boiled ; strain them in 
a colander and put them in a frying-pan, seasoning with 
pepper and salt ; dredge in a little flour, and add a small 
lump of butter ; place the pan over the fire and stir the 
onions frequently, to prevent \.v,J:x scorching. When they 
are soft and a little brown, return the steak to the pan, and 
heat all together. Place the steak on a large dish, pour the 
onions and gravy over it, and send to the table hot. 

Beefsteak and Tomatoes. — Stew a dozen good-sized tomatoes 
one hour, with salt and pepper. Then put in a pound of 
tender beefsteak, cut in small pieces, and boil fifteen min- 
utes longer. Lay buttered toast in a deep dish, pour on the 
steak and tomato, and you have a most relishing and 
healthful dish. 

Stuffed Beefsteak. — Take a rump steak about an inch thick. 
Make a stuffing of bread and herbs, and spread it over the 
steak. Roll it up, and with a needle and coarse thread sew 



7g THE HO USE WIFE' S LIBRAE K 

it together. Lay it in an iron pot on one or two wooden 
skewers, and put in water just sufficient to cover it. Let it 
stew slowly for two hours — longer if the beef is tough ; 
serve it in a dish with the gravy turned over it. To be 
carved crosswise, in slices, through beef and stuffing. 

BeeMeak Pudding. — Prepare a good suet crust, and line a 
cake tin with it; put in layers of steak, with onions, toma- 
toes and mushrooms chopped, a seasoning of pepper, salt, 
and cayenne, and half a teacupful of water before closing it 
Bake from an hour and a half to two hours, and serve hot.

11. —VEAL. 



CHOOSING VEAL, FOR ROASTING, FOR STEWING; THE HEAD, 
FEET, KIDNEYS, SWEET-BREADS, ETC. ; GENERAL USEFULNESS. 
TWENTY-ONE RECIPES FOR COOKING VEAL. 

VEAL should be fat, finely grained, white, firm, and not 
overgrown. When large, it is apt to be coarse and tough. 
and if too young, it lacks flavor and is less wholesome. 
it is more difficult to keep than any meat except pork, and 
should never be allowed to acquire the slightest taint before 
it is dressed. 

The fillet, the loin, the shoulder, and the best end of the 
neck, are the parts preferred for roasting ; the breast and 
knuckle are more usually stewed or boiled. The head and 
feet of the calf are valuable articles of food, both for the 
nutriment which the gelatinous parts of them afford, and for 
the greater variety of modes in which they may be dressed. 
The kidneys, with the rich fat that surrounds them, and the 
sweet-breads especially, are well-known delicacies; the 
liver and the heart also are very good eating ; and no meat 
'« so generally useful for rich soups and gravies as veal. 



MEATS. 77 

The best veal is from calves not less than four, or more 
than six weeks old. If younger it is not wholesome. If 
older its character begins to change materially from the 
calf's use of grasses and other food. 

RECIPES. 

Roast Veal. — Take a loin or fillet of veal ; make a stuffing 
as for roast turkey ; fill the flat with the stuf^ng, and sew it 
firmly to the loin ; rub the veal with salt, pepper, and flour, 
and put it into a pan with a little water. While roasting, 
baste frequently, letting it cook until thoroughly done. 
Allow two hours for a roast weighing from six to eight 
pounds. When done, remove the threads before sending 
to the table ; thicken the gravy with a little flour. Veal 
should be rather overdone. 

Pot-roasted Fillet. — Remove the bone and fill the cavity 
with a force-meat made of bread-crumbs, a very little salt, 
pork chopped fine, sage, pepper, salt, and ground cloves. 
Lay in the pot a layer of slices of salt pork ; put in the fil 
let, fastened with skewers, cover with additional pork, pout 
over it a pint of good stock, cover down close, and let it 
cook slowly two or three hours ; then take off the cover 
and let it brown. Serve hot. 

Boiled Fillet. — A small and delicately white fillet should 
be selected for this purpose. Bind it round with tape, after 
having washed it thoroughly ; cover it well with cold water, 
and bring it gently to a boil ; clear off carefully the scum 
as it rises, and be veiy cautious not to allow the water to 
become smoked. Let the meat be gently simmered for three 
hours and a half to four and a half, according to its weight. 
Send it to table with rich white sauce. 

Veal Stew. — Cut four or five pounds of veal into strips ; 
peel a dozen large potatoes, and cut them into slices ; place 
a layer of sliced salt pork with salt, pepper, sage, and onion. 



78 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

on the bottom of the pot, then a layer of potatoes, then a 
layer of the veal nicely seasoned. Use up the veal thus. 
Over the last layer of veal put a layer of the pork, and 
over the whole a layer of potatoes. Pour in water till it 
covers the whole ; cover the pot closely ; heat it rapidly for 
a few minutes, and then let it simmer two hours. 

Veal Hash. — Take a teacupful of boiling water in a sauce- 
pan, stir into it an even teaspoonful of flour wet in a table- 
spoonful of cold water, and let it boil five minutes ; add 
one-half teaspoonful of black pepper, as much salt, and two 
tablcspoonfuls of butter, and let it keep hot, but not boil. 
Chop the veal fine and mix with half as much stale bread- 
crumbs. Put into a pan and pour the gravy over it, then 
let it simmer ten minutes. Serve this on buttered toast. 

Veal Pie. — Line a pudding-dish with good pie crust ; into 
this put a layer of veal cut into small slices from the neck, 
or other less valuable part ; make a second layer of hard- 
boiled eggs sliced thin ; butter and pepper this layer. Add 
a layer of sliced ham, or salt pork, squeezing a few drops 
of lemon juice on the ham. Add more veal, as before, with 
eggs, ham, etc., till the dish is nearly full. Pour over a 
cupful of stock and cover with a stout crust. Bake in a 
moderate oven for two hours. 

Veal Pot Pie. — Make a crust of a dozen mashed potatoes, 
two tablcspoonfuls of butter, half a teacup of milk or cream, 
a little salt, and flour enough to stiffen it nicely. Fry half 
a dozen slices of salt pork, then cut up the veal and boil 
these together, in but little water, till the veal is almost 
done. Peel and slice a dozen potatoes quite thin, and roll 
the dough about half an inch thick and cut it into strips. 
Now build in your pot a layer of crust, meat, potatoes ; then 
sprinkle with salt and pepper. Then another set of layers, 
and top off with crust. Pour on the liquor in which the 
meat was cooked, and let all simmer for half an hour, or until 



MEATS. 79 

the top crust is cooked. Brown the crust by holding over 
it a red-hot shovel. 

Veal Loaf. — Take a piece of butter the size of an egg, three 
pounds of raw veal, one heaping teaspoonful of salt, one of 
pepper, and two raw eggs. Chop the veal fine and mix all 
together, and put in about two tablespoonfuls of water. 
Mold this into a loaf, then roll it in eight tablespoonfuls of 
rolled crackers, and pour over it three tablespoonfuls of 
melted butter ; place in a pan and bake two hours. To be 
sliced off when cold, and served at luncheon or tea. 

Veal with Oysters. — Cut the veal in small, thin slices, place 
it in layers in a jar with salt, pepper, and oysters. Pour in 
the liquor of the oysters, set the jar in a kettle of boiling 
water, and let it stew till the meat becomes very tender. 

Veal with Rice. — Pour over a small knuckle of veal rather 
more than sufficient water to cover it ; bring it slowly to a 
boil ; take off all the scum with great care ; throw in a tea- 
spoonful of salt, and when the joint has simmered for about 
half an hour, throw in from eight to twelve ounces of well- 
washed rice, and stew the veal gently for an hour and a half 
longer, or until both the meat and rice are perfectly tender. 
A seasoning of cayenne and mace in fine powder, with more 
salt, should it be required, must be added twenty or thirty 
minutes before they are served. For a superior stew, good 
veal broth may be substituted for the water. 

Veal with Peas. — A quart or more of full-grown green 
peas, instead of rice, added to the veal, prepared as above, 
as soon as the scum has been cleared off, will make a most 
excellent stew. It should be well seasoned with white 
pepper, and the mace should be omitted. 

Cutlets in Cracker. — Pound the cutlet and season, cut the 
edges into good shape ; take one ^gg, beat it a little, roll 
the cutlet in it, then cover thoroughly with rolled crackers.

III.— MUTTON AND LAMB. 

CHOOSING MUTTON AND LAMB, FOR ROASTING, FOR BOILING', 
CUTLETS, SUITABLE VEGETABLES, ETC. THIRTEEN RECIPES FOR 
MUTTON AND LAMB. 

THE best mutton is small-boned, plump, finely grained, 
and short legged ; the lean of a dark, rather than of a 
bright hue, and the fat white and clear ; when this is 
yellow, the meat is rank, and of bad quality. The leg and 
the loin are the desirable joints ; and the preference would 
probably be given to the latter, but for the superabundance 
of its fat, which renders it a somewhat wasteful part. 

The parts for roasting are the shoulder, saddle, or chine, 
the loin, and haunch. The leg is best boiled, unless the 
mutton is young and very tender. The neck is sometimes 
roasted, but it is more generally boiled ; the scrag, or that 
part of it which joins the head, is seldom used for any other 
purpose than making broth, and should be taken off before 
the joint is dressed. Cutlets from the thick end of the loin 
are commonly preferred, but they are frequently taken from 
the best end of the neck and from the middle of the leg. 

Lamb should be eaten very fresh. In the fore-quarter, the 
vein in the neck should be blue, otherwise it is stale. In the 
hind-quarter the fat of the kidney will have a slight odor if 
not quite fresh. Lamb soon loses its firmness if stale. 

New potatoes, asparagus, green peas, and spinach, are the 
vegetables to be eaten with roast lamb. 

RECIPES. 

Roast Mutton. — Wash the meat well, sprinkle with pepper 
and salt, dredge with flour, and put in the dripping-pan» 
with a little water in the bottom. Baste often with the drip- 
pings^ skim the gravy well, and thicken with flour. 



MEATS. %% 

Boiled Leg of Mutton. — Cut off the shank-bone, ^rim the 
knuckle, and wash the mutton; put it into a pot with salt, 
and cover with boiling water. Allow it to boil a few min- 
utes ; skim the surface clean, draw your pot to the side of the 
fire, and simmer until done. Time, from two to two hours 
and a half Do not try the leg with a fork to determine 
whether it is done. You lose the juices of the meat by so 
doing. Serve with caper sauce, or drawn butter, well sea- 
soned. The liquor from this boiling may be converted into 
soup with the addition of a ham-bone and a few vegetables 
boiled together. 

Mutton Dressed like Venison. — Skin and bone a loin of 
mutton, and lay it into a stewpan with a pint of water, a 
large onion stuck with a dozen cloves, half a pint of port 
wine, and a spoonful of vinegar ; add, when it boils, a little 
thyme and parsley, and some pepper and salt ; let it stew 
three hours, and turn it often. Make sonxc gravy of the 
bones, and add it at intervals to the mutton. 

Broiled Mutton Chops. — Trim off a portion of the fat, or the 
whole of it, unless it be liked ; heat the gridiron, rub it with 
a bit of the mutton suet, broil over a brisk fire, and turn 
often until they are done, which, for the generality of eaters, 
will be in about eight minutes, if the chops are not more 
than half an inch thick, which they should not be. Add 
salt and pepper with melted butter, and serve on a hot 
plate. 

Mutton and Green Peas. — Select a breast of mutton not too 
fat, cut it into small, square pieces, dredge it with flour, and fry 
to a fine brown in butter ; add pepper and salt, cover it with 
water, and set it over a slow fire to stew, until the meat is 
perfectly tender. Take out the meat, skim off all the fat from 
the gravy, and just before serving add a quart of young 
peas, previously boiled with the strained gravy, and let the 
whole boil gently until the peas are entirely done. 



S4 THE HO USE WIFE'S LIBRAR Y. 

Msh Stew. — Blanch three pounds of mutton chops by dip> 
ping them first in boihng water, for two or three minutes, 
and then into ice-cold water. Place them on the bottom of 
a clean stewpan, barely covering them with cold water. 
Bring them slowly to a boil ; add one teaspoonful of salt ; 
skim clean ; add a little parsley, mace, and a few pepper- 
corns. Simmer twenty minutes ; add a dozen small onions 
whole, and two tablespoonfuls of flour mixed well with cold 
water. Let it simmer for an hour ; add a dozen potatoes 
pared and cut to about the size of the onions. Boil till 
these are done ; then dish, placing the chops around the 
edge of the plate, and pouring the onions and potatoes into 
the centre. Strain the gravy, add three tablespoonfuls of 
chopped parsley, and pour over the stew. 

Boiled Leg of Lamb. — Choose a ewe leg, as there is more 
fat on it ; saw off the knuckle, trim off the flap, and the thick 
skin on the back of it ; soak in warm water for three hours, 
then boil gently (time according to size). Serve with oyster 
sauce. (See Sauces.) 

Roast Lamb. — Wash well, season with pepper ana salt, put 
in the dripping-pan with a little water. Baste often with 
the dripping ; skim the gravy well and thicken with flour. 

Lamb Stewed in Butter. — Select a nice loin, wash well, and 
wipe very dry ; skewer down the flap, and lay it in a close-shut- 
ting and thick stewpan, or saucepan, in which three ounces 
of good butter have been just dissolved, but not allowed to 
boil ; let it simmer slowly over a very gentle fire for two 
hours and a quarter, and turn it when it is rather more than 
half done. Lift it out, skim, and pour the gravy over it ; 
send to table with brown gravy, mint sauce, and a salad. 

Saddle of Lamb. — This is a dainty joint for a small party. 
Sprinkle a little salt over it, and set it in the dripping-pan, 
w^ith a few small pieces of butter on the meat; baste it 



MEATS. 85 

occasionally with tried-out lamb-fat; dredge a little flour 
over it a few minutes before taking from the oven. S(^ve 
with currant jelly and a few choice early vegetables. Mint- 
sauce may be served with the joint, but in a very mild form. 
(See Sauces.) 

Broiled Lamb Chops. — Trim off most of the fat ; broil over 
a brisk fire, turning frequently until the chops are nicely 
browned. Season with pepper and salt, and baste with hot 
butter. Serve on a buttered dish. 

Breaded Lamb Chops. — Grate plenty of stale bread, season 
with 3alt and pepper, have ready some well-beaten ^gg, have 
a spider with hot lard ready, take the chops one by one, dip 
into the ^gg, then into the bread-crumbs ; repeat it, as this 
will be found an improvement; then lay the chops sep- 
arately into the boiling lard, fry brown, and then turn. To 
be eaten with currant jelly. 

Lamb Steaks, Fried. — Dip each steak into well-beaten egg, 
cover with bread-crumbs or corn-meal, and fry in butter or 
new lard. Mashed potatoes and boiled rice are a necessai"y 
accompaniment. The gravy may be thickened with flour 
and butter, adding a little lemon juice ; pour this hot upon 
the steaks, and place the rice in spoonfuls around the dish 
to garnish it. 



IV.— PORK. 



PORK REQUIRES CAREFUL CHOOSING ; NEEDS THOROUGH COOK* 
ING. NINETEEN RECIPES FOR COOKING PORK. 

PORK, more than any other meat, requires to be chosen 
with the greatest care. The pig, from its gluttonous 
habits, is particularly liable to disease, and if killed 
and eaten when in an unhealthy condition, those who par- 
take of it will probably pay dearly for their indulgence, 
Dairy-fed pork is the best. 



g^ THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

If this meat be not thoroughly well-done, it is disgusting 
to the sight and poisonous to the stomach. " In the gravy 
of pork, if there is the least tint of redness," says an emi- 
nent medical authority, " it is enough to appall the sharpest 
appetite. Other meats under-done may be unpleasant, but 
pork is absolutely uneatable." 

RECIPES. 

Roast Pig. — A fat pig about three weeks old is best for a 
roast. Wash it thoroughly inside and out; chop the liver 
fine with bread-crumbs, onions, parsley, pepper, salt, and 
potatoes boiled and mashed ; make it into a paste with but- 
ter and 0.^%. Put this stuffing into the pig and sew it up ; 
put in a baking-pan with a little water and roast over a 
bright fire, basting well with butter; rub frequently also 
with a piece of lard tied in a clean rag. When thoroughly 
done, lay the pig, back up, in a dish, and put a red apple or 
pickled-mango in its mouth. Make a dressing with some 
of the stuffing, with a gla.^s of wine and some of the drip- 
ping. Serve with the roast pig, and also in a gra\y-boat. 

Roast Pork. — Choose for roasting, the loin, the leg, the 
saddle, the fillet, the shoulder, or the spare-rib. The loin 
of young pork is roasted with the skin on, and this should 
be scored in regular strips of about a quarter inch wide 
before the joints are laid to the fire. The skin of the leg 
also should be cut through in the same manner. This will 
prevent blistering, and render it more easy to. carve. In 
beginning the roasting the meat should be placed at some 
distance from the fire, in order that it may be heated through 
before the skin hardens. The basting should be constant. 
The cooking must be thorough and the meat well-browned 
before removed from the fire. 

Roast Spare-rib. — Spare-rib should be well rubbed with 
salt and pepper before it is roasted. If large and thick, it 



MEATS. 87 

will require two or three hours to roast ; a very thin piece 
may be roasted in an hour. Lay the thick end to the fire. 
When you put it down to roast, dust on some flour, and 
baste with a Httle butter. The shoulder, loin, and chine are 
roasted in the same manner. 

Leg of Pork Roasted. — Parboil a leg of pork, take off the 
skin, and then roast ; baste with butter, and make a savoiy 
powder of finely minced or dried or powdered sage, ground 
black pepper, salt, and some bread-crumbs rubbed together 
through a colander ; add to this a little ver>^ finely minced 
onion ; sprinkle the meat with this when it is almost done ; 
put a half pint of gravy into the dish. 

Baked Pork Tenderloins. — Split the tenderloin lengthwise 
nearl}^ through ; stuff with a filling of bread-crumbs, pep- 
per, salt, and sweet marjoram. Tie a string around it, to 
keep the filling in, and bake in a hot oven'for half an hour, 
basting well as the cooking proceeds. 

Pork Cutlets. — Cut them about half an inch thick from a 
delicate loin of pork, trim into neat form, and take off part 
of the fat, or the whole of it when it is not liked ; dredge a 
little pepper or cayenne upon them, and broil (or fry) over 
a clear and moderate fire from fifteen to eighteen minutes, 
sprinkle a little fine salt upon them just before they are 
dished. They may be dipped into ^^<g and then into bread- 
crumbs mixed with minced sage, then finished in the usual 
way. When fried, flour them well, and season with salt and 
pepper. Serve with gravy made in the pan. 

Boiled Ham. — The soaking Vv^hich must be given to a ham 
before it is boiled depends both on the manner in which it 
has been cured and on its age. If highly salted, hard, and 
old, a day and night, or even longer, may be requisite to 
open the pores sufficiently and to extract a portion of the 
salt. The water must be several times changed during the 
steeping. After the ham has been scraped or brushed as 



g3 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

clean as possible, pare away lightly any part which may be 
blackened or rusty. Lay it into a suitable kettle and cover 
it plentifully with cold water ; bring it very slowly to boil, 
and clear off the scum, which will be thrown up in great 
abundance So soon as the water has been cleared from 
this, draw the pot to the edge of the stove, that the ham 
may be simmered slowly but steadily, until it is tender. On 
no account allow it to boil fast. When it can be probed 
very easily with a sharp skewer, lift it out, strip off the skin, 
and return the ham to the water to cool. 

Baked Ham. — A ham of sixteen pounds must be boiled 
three hours, then skin and rub in half a pound of brown 
sugar, cover with bread-crumbs, and bake well for two 
hours. 

Glazed Ham. — Take a cold-boiled ham from which the skin 
has been removed, and brush it well all over with beaten 
Ggg- To a cup of powdered cracker allow enough rich 
milk or cream to make into a thick paste, salt it, and work 
in a teaspoonful of melted butter. Spread this evenly, a 
quarter of an inch thick, over the ham, and set to brown in 
a moderate oven. 

Ham and Eggs. — Cut the ham in very thin sh'ces, and fry 
long enough to cook the fat, but not long enough to crisp 
the lean. A very little boiling water may be put into the 
frying-pan to secure the ham moist and tender. Remove 
the ham when it is done, break eggs gently into the pan, 
without breaking the yelks, and fry till done, about three 
minutes. The eggs will not require to be turned. Cut off 
the uneaven edges, place the eggs around the ham, and pour 
in the gravy. 

Ham or Tongue Toast. — Toast a thick slice of bread and 
butter it on both sides. Take a small quantity of remains 
*)f ham or tongue, grate it, and put it in a stewpan with two 



ME A TS. g9 

hard-boiled eggs chopped fine, and mixed with a little but- 
ter, salt, and cayenne ; heat it quite hot, then spread thickly 
upon the buttered toast. Serve while hot. 

Broiled Salt Pork. — Cut the pork in thin slices. Put a lit- 
tle water in the pan, and when it has boiled three minutes 
pour it off; dredge the pork with flour and brown it. 

Bax)on Broiled or Fried. — Cut evenly into thin slices, or rash- 
e7's ; pare from them all rind and rust; curl them round; 
fasten them with small, slight skewers, then gently fry, broil, 
or toast them ; draw out the skewers before they are sent to 
table. A few minutes will dress them either way. They 
may be cooked without being curled. The slow cooking is 
necessary that the meat may be well done without being 
dried or hardened. 

Fried Sausage. — Sausages should be used while quite fresh. 
Melt a piece of butter or dripping in a clean frying-pan ; 
when just melted, put in the sausages, shake the pan for a 
minute, and keep turning them ; do not break or prick 
them ; fry them over a very slow fire till they are nicely 
browned ; when done, lay them on a hair-sieve before the 
fire to drain the fat from them. The secret of cooking sau- 
sages well is to let them heat very gradually. If so done 
the skins will not burst if they are fresh. The common 
practice of pricking them lets the gravy out, which is un- 
desirable. 

Baked Sausages. — The most wholesome way to cook sau- 
sages is to bake them. Place them in a baking-pan in a 
single layer, and bake in a moderate oven ; turn them over 
when half done, that they may be equally browned. Serve 
with pieces of toast between them, having cut the toast 
about the same size as the sausage, and moistened it with a 
little of the sausage fat. 

Sausage Meat. — Many prefer to use sausage meat in bulk. 



90 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Small portions of the meat should be packed lightly to* 
gether and fried slowly until nicely browned. When done, 
drain through a hair-sieve. Do not pack hard. It will 
make the sausages tough. 

Scrappel. — Boil a hog's head one day, and let it stand five 
or six hours, or all night. Slip out the bones and chop 
fine ; then return the meat to the liquor ; skim when cold ; 
warm and season freely with pepper, salt, sage, and sweet 
herbs. Add tw^o cupfuls of buckwheat-meal and one cup- 
ful of corn-meal. Put into molds, and when cold cut into 
slices and fry for breakfast. 

Boiled Pork. — The shoulder or leg are regarded as the 
most economical pieces for boiling. They should be well 
salted first, by about ten days' pickling. Boil precisely as 
ham is boiled, but not for so long a time, about three hours 
sufficing to thoroughly cook an ordinary sized leg of pork. 
After it has come to the boiling point, let the process pro- 
ceed slowly as possible. Peel off the skin when done and 
spot the surface with dashes of red and black pepper, or 
with allspice, or garnish with parsley. 

Souse. — Pigs' feet and ears may be soused by cleaning 
thoroughly, soaking in salt and water several days, and then 
boiling till the bones can be picked out with ease and the 
skin peeled off Cover the meat and gelatinous substance 
with boiling vinegar, highly spiced with peppercorns and 
mace. This may be eaten cold or the meat may be fried 
after dipping in ^^^ and cracker. 

Pig's head may be prepared the same way, the meat being 
chopped fine and mixed with pounded crackers. Mix with 
herbs, spices, salt, and pepper to taste, and a small quantity 
of vinegar. Press into a mold, or a jar, and cut in slices. 
To be eaten cold.

VEGETABLES SHOULD BE FRESH — HOW TO WASH AND PRESERVE — 

HOW TO COOK WELL, AND IMPORTANCE OF SO DOING SUITABLE 

POTS FOR COOKING VEGETABLES — VEGETABLES SUITABLE TO 
CERTAIN MEATS. SIXTY RECIPES FOR COOKING VEGETABLES. 

ALL vegetables should be used when fresh as possible. 
Wash them thoroughly, and allow them to lie in cold 
water until ready to be used. 

Great care must be taken to remove gravel and insects 
from heads of lettuce, cabbage, and cauliflower. To do 
this, lay them for half an hour or more in a pan of strong 
brine, placing the stalk ends uppermost. This will destroy 
the small snails and other insects which cluster in the 
leaves, and they will fall out and sink to the bottom. 

Strong-flavored vegetables, like turnips, cabbage, and 
greens, require to be put into a large quantity of water. 
More delicate vegetables, such as peas, asparagus, etc., 
require less water. As a rule, in boiling vegetables, let the 
water boil before putting them in, and let it continue to 
boil until they are done. Nothing is more indigestible than 
vegetables not thoroughly cooked. Just when they arc 
done must be ascertained to a certainty in each particular 
case, without depending upon any general directions. 

Never let boiled vegetables stand in the water after com. 
ing off the fire ; put them instantly into a colander over a 
pot of boiling water, and let them remain there, if you have 
to keep them back from the table. 

An iron pot will spoil the color of the finest greef^s ; they 
should be boiled by themselves in a tin, brass, or Copper 
vessel.

92 THE HO USE WIFE' S LIBRAR Y. 

Potatoes are good with all meats. Carrots, parsnips, tur« 
nips, greens, and cabbage belong with boiled meats ; beets, 
peas, and beans are appropriate to either boiled or roast. 

RECIPES. 

Boiled White Potatoes. — Peel off a strip about a quarter of 
an inch wide, lengthwise, around each potato. Put them 
on in cold water, with a teaspoonful of salt in it. Let them 
boil fifteen minutes, then pour off half the water and replace 
it with cold water. When the edge of the peel begins to 
curl up they are done. Remove them from the pot, cover 
the bottom of a baking-tin with them, place them in the 
oven, with a towel over them, for fifteen minutes, leaving 
the oven door open. Then serve with or without the skins. 

The use of cold water in boiling potatoes, as in this recipe, 
is exceptional. Hot water is generally used, but for this 
purpose cold seems preferable. 

Roasted Wiiite Potatoes. — Select the largest and finest 
potatoes for roasting. Wash them thoroughly and put in 
the oven with their skins on. Roast about one hour, turn- 
ing them occasionally with a fork. When done, send them 
to the table hot, and in their skins. 

Potatoes Roasted witii Meats. — To roast potatoes with beef, 
poultry, and other meats, peel the potatoes, lay them in a 
pan, and cook them in the gravy. It is quite proper to 
roast both white and sweet of potatoes in the same pan. 

Mashed Potatoes. — Steam or boil pared potatoes until soft, 
in salted water ; pour off the water and let them drain per- 
fectly dry ; sprinkle with salt and mash ; have ready hot 
milk or cream, in which has been melted a piece of butter ; 
pour this on the potatoes, and stir until white and very light. 
A solid, heavy masher is not desirable. An open wire tool 
is much better. 



VEGETABLES. 93 

Stewed Potatoes. — Take sound raw potatoes, and divide 
each into four parts, or more, if they be very large. Put 
them into the stewpan ; add salt, pepper, and a piece of 
fresh butter; pour in milk, with a little cream, just to keep 
the potatoes from burning. Cover the saucepan, and allow 
the potatoes to stew until thoroughly soft and tender. 

Pried Potatoes. — Boil some good and large potatoes until 
nearly done; set them aside a few minutes; when suffi- 
ciently cool, slice or chop them ; sprinkle them with pepper 
and salt, and fry in butter or fresh lard until they are of a 
light brown color. Serve hot. 

Saratoga Potatoes. — Peel and slice the potatoes on a slaw- 
cutter, into cold water ; wash .them thoroughly, and drain ; 
spread between the folds of a clean cloth, rub and pat until 
dr}^ Fry a few at a time in boiling lard ; salt as you take 
them out. Saratoga potatoes are very nice when eaten cold. 
They can be prepared three or four hours before needed, 
and if kept in a warm place they will be crisp and nice. 
They may be used for garnishing game and steaks. 

Potato Cakes. — Mash thoroughly a lot of potatoes just 
boiled ; add a little salt, butter and cream ; fry brown on 
both sides, after making into little cakes. 

Boiled Sweet Potatoes. — Take large, fine potatoes, wash 
clean ; boil with the skins on in plenty of water, but without 
salt. They will take at least one hour. Drain off the water, 
and set them for a few minutes in a tin pan before the fire, 
or in the oven, that they may be well dried. Peel them be- 
fore sending to the table. 

Roasted Sweet Potatoes. — Sweet potatoes are roasted in the 
same manner as white, but they require a little longer time. 

Fried Sweet Potatoes. — Choose large potatoes, half boil 
them, and then, having taken off the skins, cut the potatoes 
«a slices cind fry in butter, or in nice drippings. 



94 THE HO USE WIFE'S L IBRAR V. 

Stewed Tomatoes. — Pour boiling water on the tomatoes to 
be used, and then peel and slice them. Stew them gently, 
without adding any water, fifteen minutes ; then add some 
pulverized cracker or bread crumbs, sufficient to thicken it 
a little, and salt and pepper to your taste. Stew fifteen min- 
utes longer, and add a large piece of butter. 

The thickening suggested is not essential. Many prefer 
the pure tomatoes. Try both ways and adopt the more 
pleasing. 

Broiled Tomatoes. — Cut large tomatoes in two, from side to 
side, not from top to bottom ; place them on a gridiron, the 
cut surface down ; when well seared, turn them and put on 
butter, salt, and pepper ; then cook with the skin side down 
until done. 

Fried Tomatoes. — Cut the tomatoes in slices without skin- 
ning ; pepper and salt them well ; then sprinkle a little flour 
over them and fry in butter until browned. Put them on a 
hot platter ; then pour milk or cream into the butter and 
juice, and when this is boiling hot, pour it over the tomatoes. 

Tomatoes Baked Whole. — Select a number of sound, ripe 
tomatoes. Cut a round hole in the stem side of each, and 
stuff it with bread-crumbs, nicely peppered and salted ; cover 
the bottom of the pan with the tomatoes, the opened side 
upward ; put in a very little water, dredge with flour, and 
bake till brown. Serve hot. 

Baked Sliced Tomatoes. — Skin the tomatoes, slice in small 
pieces ; spread a thick layer in the bottom of a pudding 
dish ; cover with a thin layer of bread-crumbs, and sprinkle 
salt, pepper, and a few small pieces of butter over them ; 
add another layer of tomatoes, then of crumbs, etc., until 
the dish is filled ; sprinkle over the top a layer of fine rolled 
crackers ; bake one hour. Canned tomatoes, put up whole, 
may be used nicely this way. 



VEGETABLES. 95 

. Tomatoes a la Creme. — Pare and slice ripe tomatoes ; one 
pound of fresh ones or a quart can ; stew until perfectly 
smooth, season with salt and pepper, and add a piece of but- 
ter the size of an ^%%. Just before taking from the fire, stir 
in one cup of cream, with a tablespoonful of flour stirred 
smooth in a part of it ; do not let it boil after the flour is put 
in. Have ready in a dish some pieces of toast ; pour the 
tomatoes over this and serve. 

Boiled (jreen Com. — Take off the outside leaves and the 
silk, letting the innermost leaves remain on until after the 
corn is boiled, which renders the corn much sweeter. Boil 
for half an hour in plenty of water, drain, and after fully re- 
moving the leaves, serve. 

Baked Corn. — Grate one dozen ears of sweet corn, one cup 
of milk, a small piece of butter ; salt to taste, and bake in a 
pudding dish for one hour. 

Corn Fritters, see Fritters. 

Lima Beans. — Shell, wash, and put into boiling water; 
when boiled tender, drain and season them. Dress with 
cream, or with a large lump of butter, and let the whole 
simmer for a few moments before serving. 

Succotash. — Take ten ears of green corn and one pint of 
Lima beans ; cut the corn from the cob, and stew gently 
with the beans until tender. Use as little water as possible. 
Season with butter, salt, and pepper — milk, if you choose. 
If a few of the cobs are stewed in the succotash, it will 
improve the flavor, as there is great sweetness in the cob. 

String Beans. — Remove the strings of the beans with a 
knife, and cut off both ends. Cut each bean into three 
pieces, boil tender, add butter when they are done, pepper 
and salt, and serve hot. 

Boiled Beans. — Dried beans must soak over night in soft 
water ; put them in a strong bag, leaving room for them to 



96 THE HO USE WIFE' S L IBRAR Y. 

swell ; let them boil in a plenty of water until done ; hang 
up the bag that all the water may drain off; then season 
with butter, pepper, and salt to the taste. 

Baked Beans. — Put the beans to soak early in the evening, 
in a dish that will allow plenty of water to be used. Change 
the water at bed-time. Next morning early, parboil two 
hours; pour off nearly all the water; take raw pork, scored 
on top ; put the beans in a deep dish, a stoneware jar is very 
nice, the pork in the middle, sinking it so as to have it just 
level with the surface. Add half a teaspoonful of soda, two 
tablespoonfuls of molasses, and bake at least six hours. As 
the beans bake dry, add more water, a little at a time, until 
the last hour, when it is not necessarj^ to moisten them. 

Boiled Green Peas. — The peas should be young and freshly 
shelled ; wash and drain them carefully ; put them into fast- 
boiling, salted water ; when quite tender drain, and add pep- 
per, butter, and a little milk. Serve hot. 

Boiled Asparagus. — Scrape the stems of the asparagus 
lightly, but make them very clean, throwing them into cold 
water as you proceed. When all are scraped, tie them in 
bunches of equal size ; cut the hard ends evenly, that all 
may be of the same length, and put into boiling water. 
Prepare several slices of delicately browned toast half an 
inch thick. When the stalks are tender, lift them out and 
season with pepper and salt. Dip the toast quickly into the 
liquor in which the asparagus was boiled, and dish the veg- 
etable upon it, the points, or the butts, meeting in the cen- 
tre of the dish. Pour rich melted butter over it, and send 
to the table hot. 

Boiled Beets. — Wash, but do not cut them, as cutting de- 
stroys the sweetness ; let them boil from two to three hours, 
or until they are perfectly tender ; then take them up, peel 
and slice them, and pour vinegar, or melted butter^ ovei 
them, as may be preferred. 



VEGETABLES. 97 

Potato Hillocks. — Whip boiled potatoes light with a 
little butter and milk, and season with salt and pepper. 
Beat in a raw ^gg-^ to bind the mixture ; shape into small 
conical heaps, set in a greased pan in the oven, and as 
they brown, glare with butter. The oven must be very 
hot. Slip a cake-turner under each hillock and transfer 
to a hot platter. — Marion Harland, 

Potato Pie. — Pare and cut four good-sized potatoes 
into dice, cover them wdth boiling w^ater, boil ten min- 
utes, drain. Add to them one tablespoonful chopped 
parsley, one of chopped ham and one of chopped onion. 
Season with salt and pepper and turn into a baking dish. 
Add one teaspoonful of baking pow^der and a half of 
salt to one pint of flour, mix and add sufficient milk to 
make a soft dough. Roll out and cover the top of the 
baking dish, just as you would an ordinary pie. Brush 
with milk and bake in a quick oven twenty minutes. 
Serve hot with cream sauce. — Mrs. S, T. Rorer, 

Stuffed Onions. — Select large onions, the Spanish va- 
riety preferred, and cook them in a steamer until tender, 
but not broken. Let them cool, then cut off a slice 
from the top and scoop out the inside, leaving not more 
than two or three layers. Chop the part removed, and 
chop with it some sweet green pepper (one teaspoon for 
each onion). Into the onion cups put several boiled 
chestnuts (shelled), and fill the spaces with the chopped 
mixture. Add a teaspoon of butter and a little salt, and 
stand the onions in a pan of water. Bake until very 
soft, and when nearly done cover the top with buttered 
cracker crumbs and return to the oven until the crumbs 
are crisp. When the crumbs are crisp, have ready a 
tomato sauce and pour it over them on the serving dish. 
— Mrs. Lincoln, 



98 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Fried Egg-plant. — Pare and cut in slices quarter of an inclh 
thick ; sprinkle with salt ; cover and let stand for an hour. 
Pour off the juice or water which exudes; wipe each slice 
dry ; dip first in beaten ^^^^ then in rolled cracker or bread 
crumbs. Season with pepper and salt, and fry brown in but- 
ter. Serve very hot. 

Fried Egg-plant No. 2. — Put into water and boil until soft, 
then cut in two and scoop out all the inside ; season ; take 
a tablespoonful of the remaining pulp at a time, dip in egg 
and bread-crumbs, and fry in hot lard. Serve hot. 

Baked Egg-plant. — Boil them till somewhat tender, in order 
to remove the bitter flavor. Then slit each one down the 
side, and take out the seeds. Have ready a stuffing made 
of grated cracker, butter, minced herbs, salt, pepper, nut- 
meg, and beaten yelk of eggs. Fill with this the cavity left 
by the seeds, and bake the plants in a hot oven. Serve with 
well-seasoned gravy poured around them in the dish. 

Boiled Cabbage. — Strip off the loose or withered leaves, and 
v/ash well ; then split in two, or if the head be veiy large, 
into four pieces, and put into boiling water with some salt ; 
let it boil slowly, skimming carefully and frequently. When 
done, strain through a colander. Serve in a vegetable-dish 
and lay inside, among the leaves, some bits of butter ; sea- 
son with pepper, and serve while hot. 

Boiled Cauliflower. -• Trim off all the outside leaves; wraj^ 
in a cloth and put into boiling water well salted ; boil until 
tender, and then serve with drawn butter. 

Cabbage a la Cauliflower. — Cut the cabbage fine, as for 
slaw ; put it into a stewpan, cover with water, and keep 
closely covered ; when tender, drain off the water ; put in a 
small piece of butter, with a little salt, one-half a cupful of 
cream, or one cupful of milk. Leave on the stove a few 
minutes before serving. 



VEGETABLES. 99 

Boiled Tiimips. — Pare and cut into pieces ; put them into 
boiling water well salted, and boil until tender ; drain thor- 
oughly and then mash and add a piece of butter, pepper, 
and salt to taste. Stir until they are thoroughly mixed, and 
serve hot. 

Boiled Onions. — Skin them carefully and put them to boil ; 
when they have boiled a few minutes, pour off the water, 
add clean cold water, and then set them to boil again. 
Pour this away also, and add more cold water, when they 
may boil till done. This change of waters will make them 
white and clear, and very mild in flavor. After they are 
done, pour off all the water, and dress with a little cream, 
salt, and pepper to taste. 

Fried Onions. — Peel and slice fresh, solid onions very 
evenly, then fry them in a pan of hot butter till slightly 
browned. 

Boiled Leeks. — Trim off the coarser leaves of young leeks, 
cut them into equal lengths, tie them in small bunches, and 
boil in plenty of water, previously salted. Serve on toast, 
and send melted butter to the table with them. 

Boiled Squash. — Remove the seeds ; boil till very tender ; 
then press out all the water through a colander, and mash, 
with butter, pepper, and salt. 

Fried Squash. — Pare the squash, cut in slices, dip in ^<g<g 
seasoned with pepper and salt, then into cracker dust, and 
fry to a nice brown. 

Boiled Parsnips. — Scrape thoroughly, then wash and boil 
in a little water well salted. When done, dress with butter 
and a little pepper, or drawn butter, if desired. 

Fried Parsnips. — Having boiled your parsnips, split open 
the largest ones, season with pepper and salt, dredge a littk 
flour over them, and fry to a light brown.

Boiled Spinacll. — Boil the spinach in plenty of water, drain? 
and press the moisture from it ; chop it small, put it into a 
clean saucepan, with a slice of fresh butter, and stir the 
whole until well mixed and very hot. Smooth it in a dish, 
and send it quickly to table. 

Boiled Greens. — Turnip-tops, mustard-tops, cabbage-leaves, 
beet-tops, cowslips, dandelions, and various similar articles 
are much relished in the spring,. boiled in salt and water or 
with salt pork. When done sufficiently they will sink to 
the bottom. 

Stewed Celery. — Clean the heads thoroughly; take off the 
coarse, green, outer leaves ; cut the stalks into small pieces, 
and stew in a little broth ; when tender, add some rich 
cream, a little flour, and butter enough to thicken the 
cream. Season with pepper, salt, and a little nutmeg, if 
that is agreeable. 

Boiled Articliokes. — Soak the artichokes and wash them in 
several waters ; cut the stalks even ; trim away the lower 
leaves, and the ends of the other leaves ; boil in salted 
water with the tops downward, and let them remain until 
the leaves can be easily drawn out. Before serving, remove 
the surrounding leaves, and send the remainder to the table 
with melted butter. 

Broiled Mushrooms. — In order to test mushrooms, sprinkle 
salt on the gills ; if they turn yellow, they are poisonous ; if 
they turn black, they are good. When satisfied at this 
point, pare, and cut off the stems, dip them in melted butter, 
season with salt and pepper, broil them on both sides over 
a clear fire, and serve on toast. 

Stewed Mushrooms. — Being sure you have the genuine 
mushrooms, put them in a small saucepan, season with 
pepper and salt, add a spoonful of butter and a spoonful or 
two of gravy from roast meat, or, if this be not at hand, the 



VEGETABLES. 101 

same quantity of good, rich cream ; shake them about over 
the fire, and when they boil they are done. 

Boiled Rice. — Wash a cupful of rice in two or three 
waters ; let it lie for a few minutes in the last water, then 
put it into three quarts of fast-boiling water, with a little 
salt; let it boil twenty minutes, then turn into a colander, 
drain, and serve, using such sauce or dressing as may be 
desired. 

Boiled Hominy. — Soak one cupful of fine hominy over 
night in three cupfuls of water, and salt to taste ; in the 
morning turn it into a quart pail ; then put the pail into a 
kettle of boiling water, cover tightly, and steam one hour ; 
add one teacupful of sweet milk, and boil fifteen minutes 
additional, then serve hot. 

Stewed Macaroni. — Break the macaroni into small pieces, 
wash it, and put into salted hot water ; cook about twenty 
minutes ; drain, and put in a egetable dish a layer of 
macaroni, sprinkle with grated cheese, bits of butter, pepper 
and salt ; proceed in this manner until the dish is full, but 
omit the cheese at the last. Set the dish in the oven for a 
few minutes, and let it get thoroughly hot. 

Baked Macaroni. — For baked macaroni, proceed as in 
stewed, but, when prepared fully as above, pour a few 
spoonfuls of milk over the top, and bake half an hour. 

Macaroni with Tomatoes. — Have water boiling in a large 
saucepan; throw into it macaroni, broken, bat not too short; 
let it cook twenty to thirty minutes, pour over it some cold 
water, and strain it quite dry ; cut an onion into small dice, 
throw it into cold water and squeeze it dry in a cloth ; put 
some olive oil, butter, or clarified fat into a saucepan ; the 
oil, of course, is best. Throw into it the onion, and let it 
cook, shaking occasionally, until the onion is almost melted 
away. Have some cooked tomatoes ready to add to this

sauce. If it is too thick, add some cold water by teaspoon- 
fuls at a time. Let all simmer for ten minutes longer. 
Sprinkle some grated cheese over your macaroni, which 
must be piping hot, in a dish. Pour the sauce over this and 
serve. A quarter of a pound of macaroni makes a large 
dish, and takes about a third of a can to ha)f a can of 
tomatoes. 

Sliced Cucumbers. — Peel and slice the cucumbers as thin as 
possible ; lay the slices in salted water for an hour ; then 
pour off the water; cover them with vinegar, half a tea- 
spoonful of pepper, and salt as may be necessary. 

Stewed Oyster-plant. — Cut off the tops of a bunch of 
salsify, or oyster-plant, close to the root ; scrape and wash 
well, and slice lengthwise or round ; stew until tender in 
salted water ; drain and put in a stewpan, cover with milk ; 
to one pint of salsify add a tablespoonful of butter rolled in 
flour ; season with salt and pepper ; let it stew a few min- 
utes and add a little vinegar, if liked. 

Mock Fried Oysters. — Scrape one bunch of salsify, and boil 
until tender ; mash through a colander, add one beaten ^^^, 
a small piece of butter, salt and pepper to taste; drop by the 
spoonful into hot lard and fry brown. 

Egg-Plant. — Cut the plant into slices one-third of an 
inch thick, w^ithout removing the skin. Sprinkle salt 
over each slice, pile them, and cover with a w^eight to 
press out the juice. Drain, and dip each slice first in 
fine crumbs, then in beaten ^g^<> and again in crumbs, 
and saute them in hot fat. — The Peerless Cook Book : 
Mrs. D . A. Lincoln. Roberts Brothers., Publishers. 

Water-Cresses. — -Wash w^ell, pick off decayed leaves, 
and leave m ice-water until you are ready to eat them. 
They should then be shaken free of wet and piled light- 
ly in a glass dish. Eat with salt. — Marion Harland, ^

SAUCES DEFINED — IHEIR USES AND COMPOSITION. HOV/ TO 

PREPARE INGREDIENTS FOR SALADS, WHAT VEGETABLES TO 
EMPLOY, FRESHNESS, EXCELLENCE, ETC. THIRTY-SIX RECIPES 
FOR SALADS AND SAUCES. ^ 

UNDER the head of salads all preparations of uncooked 
herbs or vegetables is placed. They are usually- 
dressed with salt, vinegar, oil, and spices. Sometimes 
they are combined with meat or shell fish, as chicken, veal, 
lobster, et;c. They are used chiefly as relishes with other 
food. 

Sauces are generally used to impart a relish to articles 
of food. Sometimes vegetables are employed as the basis 
of sauces, but they are compounded chiefly of savory con- 
diments, that they may add zest to eating. 

Meat or fish used in salads should not be minced, but 
rather picked apart, or cut in pieces of moderate size. Cab- 
bage, celery, asparagus, cauliflower, water-cress, and all 
kinds of lettuce are the vegetables best adapted for use in 
salads. They must be used when quite fresh and crisp, and 
all the ingredients used in their dressing must be of the 
best quality and flavor. 

All condiments are in some sense sauces, but the term is 
usually confined to those which are the result of compound- 
ing a variety of articles.

Coldslaw, No. 2. — Take equal parts of chopped cabbage 
and the green stalks of celery. Season with salt, pepper, 
and vinegar. 

Maryland Coldslaw. — Halve the cabbage and lay it in cold 
water for one hour ; shave down the head into small slips 
with a sharp knife. Put in a saucepan a cup of vinegar, and 
let it boil ; then add a cup of cream, with the yelks of two 
eggs, well beaten ; let it boil up, and pour over the cabbage. 
As soon as the cabbage is cut it should be sprinkled with a

VIII.— CROQUETTES AND FRITTERS. 



CROQUETTES DEFINED ; FRITTERS DEFINED ; USES OF BOTH. 
TWENTY-FOUR RECIPES FOR CROQUETTES AND FRITTERS. 

THE term croquette (pronounced cro-ket) is from a French 
verb, meaning " to crunch." It designates all that class 
of preparations made of minced meat, or other in- 
gredients, highly seasoned and fried in bread-crumbs. 

Fritters, like croquettes, are fried, but they are made of 
batter containing other ingredients, as taste may dictate. 
Both these preparations are used as accessories of the din- 
ner or tea table rather than as principal dishes. 

RECIPES. 

Rice Croquettes. — Put a quarter of a pound of rice into a 
pmt of milk. Let it simmer gently until the rice is tender 
and the milk absorbed. It must then be boiled until thick 
and dry, or it will be difficult to mold. Add three table- 
spoonfuls of sugar, one of butter, one ^%^, and flavor to taste 
with vanilla or cinnamon ; beat thoroughly for a few minutes, 
and when cold form into balls or cones, dip these into 
beaten Q^'g^ roll lightly in bread-crumbs, and fry in hot butter. 

Hommy Croquettes. — To a cupful of cold boiled hominy 
(small grained) add a tablespoonful of melted butter and stir 
hard; moisten by degrees with a cupful of milk, beating to a 
soft, light paste. Put in a teaspoonful of white sugar and a 
well-beaten ^gg. Roll into oval balls with floured hands, 
dip in beaten ^^g^ then in cracker-crumbs, and fry in hot 
lard. 

Ill 



112 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY, 

Potato Croquettes. — Season cold mashed potatoes with pep- 
per, salt, and nutmeg. Beat to a cream, with a tablespoon- 
ful of melted butter to every cupful of potato. Add two or 
three beaten eggs and some minced parsley. Roll into small 
balls; dip in beaten ^^^, then in bread-crumbs, and fry in 
hot lard. 

Oyster-Plant Croquettes. — Wash, scrape, and boil the oyster- 
plant till tender; rub it through a colander, and mix with 
the pulp a little butter, cream, salt, cayenne, and lemon juice; 
mix the ingredients thoroughly together to a smooth paste, 
and set the dish in the ice-box to get cold ; then shape it 
into small cones, dip them in beaten ^^%, roll in crumbs, 
and fry crisp and brown. 

CMcken Croquettes. — Add to the quantity of minced chicken; 
about one-quarter the quantity of bread-crumbs, also one 
€gg well beaten to each cupful of meat ; pepper, salt, and 
chopped parsley to taste, add the yelks of two hard-boiled 
eggs rubbed smooth. Add gravy or drawn butter to moisten 
it, make into cones or balls, roll in cracker-dust or flour, 
and fry in hot lard. 

Veal Croquettes. — Make these the same as chicken cro- 
quettes, by substituting for the chicken cold minced veal and 
ham in equal parts. The salt may be omitted, as the 
ham usually supplies it sufficiently. Turkey, duck, or the 
remains of any cold game or meat may be used in the same 
way with very satisfactory results. 

Oyster Croquettes. — Take the hard ends of the oysters, leav- 
ing the other end for a soup or stew ; scald them, then chop 
fine, and add an equal weight of potatoes rubbed through a 
colander ; to one pound of this combination add two ounces 
of butter, one teaspoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful of pep- 
per, half a teaspoonful of mace, and one-half gill of cream, 
make in small rolls, dip them in ^^^ and grated bread, fry 
in deep, hot lard.

ing been well beaten. Drop this batter by large spoon- 
fuls into boiling lard and fry to a light brown. Serve hot, 
powdered with white sugar. 

Bread Fritters. — Grate stale bread until you have a pint of 
crumbs ; pour a pint of boiling milk upon these, a table- 
spoonful of butter having been dissolved in it, and let the 
whole stand for an hour. Then beat up the mixture and 
flavor with nutmeg. Stir in gradually a quarter pound of 
white sugar, two tablespoonfuls of brandy, six well-beaten 
eggs, and currants enough to flavor the whole. The cur- 
rants should be washed, dried, and floured.' Drop by large 
spoonfuls into boiling lard and fry to a light brown. Serve 
with wine and powdered sugar. 

Potato Fritters. — Break open four nicely baked potatoes ; 
scoop out the insides with a spoon, and mix with them a

flour as will make a thick batter. Fry them in thin cakes 
and serve with butter and white powdered sugar. 

Parsnip Fritters. — Boil four good-sized parsnips in salted 
water until tender ; drain them, beat them to a pulp, and 
squeeze the water from them as much as possible ; bind 
them together with a beaten ^^^ and a little flour. Shape

IX.— EGGS. 



NUTRITIOUS VALUE OF EGGS — TEST OF FRESHNESS PACKING EGGS 

— PRESERVING EGGS. THIRTY-THREE WAYS OF COOKING EGGS. 



HIGH chemical authorities agree that there is more nutri- 
ment in an Qgg than in any substance of equal bulk 
found in nature or produced by art. They are much 
used for food the world over, and few articles are capable 
of more varied employment. 

The freshness of an Qgg may be determined in various 
ways. In a fresh egg, the butt end, if touched on the 
tongue, is sensibly warmer than the point end. If held to^ 
ward the light and looked through (" candled "), a fresh egg 
will show a clear white and a well-rounded yelk. A stale 
egg will appear muddled. Probably the surest test is to put 
the eggs into a pan of cold water. Fresh eggs sink quickly ; 
bad eggs float ; suspicious ones act suspiciously, neither 
sinking nor floating very decidedly. Of all articles of food, 
doubtful eggs are most certainly to be condemned. 

On the packing of eggs, the following conclusions may 
be regarded as established among egg-dealers : By cold 
storage, temperature forty to forty-two degrees Fahrenheit, 
kept uniform, with eggs packed properly or in cases, they 
will keep in good condition from six to nine months ; but 
they must be used soon after being taken out of the cold 
storage, as they soon spoil. Eggs become musty from being 
packed in bad material. They will become musty in cases, 
as a change of temperature causes the eggs to sweat and 
the wrapping-paper to become moist and taint the tggs, 

117 



113 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Well-dried oats, a year old, makes the best packing. . Eggs 
become " mixed " by jarring in shipping. Fresh eggs mix 
worse than those kept in cold storage. Eggs which have 
been held in cold storage in the West should be shipped in 
refrigerator cars in summer. Eggs will keep thirty days 
longer if stood on the little end than in any other position. 
They must be kept at an even temperature and in a pure 
atmosphere. Eggs laid on the side attach to the shell and 
are badly injured. To prevent imposition as to the freshness 
of the eggs, the ^^^ gatherers should " candle " them when 
they get them from the farmers. Eggs keep better in the 
dark than in the light. 

Methods of preservation for domestic purposes are, to 
pack them in bran or salt, the small end down ; to grease 
them with linseed oil, or dip them in a light varnish. For 
extra long keeping, slack one pound of lime in a gallon of 
water ; when this is entirely cold, place it in a jar and fill 
with fresh eggs. Do not agitate the contents when eggs 
are removed from the jar. Eggs kept so will continue good 
for a year. 

The French method of preserving eggs is to dissolve 
beeswax and olive oil and anoint the eggs all over. If left 
undisturbed in a cool place, they will remain good for two 
years. 

RECIPES. 

Boiled Eggs. — Put into a saucepan of boiling water with a 
tablespoon, being careful not to break or crack them. Boil 
steadily three minutes, if you want them soft ; ten, if hard. 

Another way is to put them on in cold water, and let it 
come to a boil. The inside, white and yelk, will be then of 
the consistency of custard. 

Still another way is to put them in water, heated to the 
boiling point, and let them stand from five to seven minutes 
without boiling. If desired for salad, boil them ten minutes; 



EGGS. 119 

then throw them in cold water ; roll them gently on a table 
or board, and the shell can be easily removed. Wire ^^'g 
racks, to set in boiling hot water with the eggs held in place, 
are exceedingly convenient. 

Boiled I^gs, witli Sauce. — Boil hard, remove the shell, set 
in a hot dish, and serve with seasoning and sauce to taste. 

Poached E^gs. — Have the water well salted, but do not let 
it boil hard. Break the eggs separately into a saucer, and 
slip them singly into the water ; when nicely done, remove 
with a skimmer, trim neatly, and lay each ^<g^ upon a small 
thin square of buttered toast, then sprinkle with salt and 
pepper. Some persons prefer them poached rather than 
fried with ham ; in which case substitute the ham for toast. 

Poached Eggs with Ham Sauce. — Mince fine two or three 
slices of boiled ham, a small onion, a little parsley, pepper, 
and salt ; stew together for a quarter of an hour ; put the 
poached eggs in a dish, squeeze over them the juice of a 
lemon, and pour on the sauce hot but not boiling. 

Poached Eggs a la Creme. — Nearly fill a clean frying-pan 
with water boiling hot ; strain a tablespoonful of vinegar 
through double muslin, and add to the water with a little 
salt. Slip your eggs from the saucer upon the top of the 
water (first taking the pan from the fire). Boil three min- 
utes and a half; drain, and lay on buttered toast in a hot 
dish. Turn the water from the pan and pour in half a cup- 
ful of cream or milk. If you use the latter, thicken with a 
very little corn-starch. Let it heat to a boil, stirring to pre- 
vent burning, and add a great spoonful of butter, some pep- 
per, and salt. Boil up once and pour over the eggs. Or 
better still, heat the milk in a separate saucepan, that the 
eggs may not have to stand. A little broth improves the 
sauce. 



1 20 THE HO USE WIFE'S LIBRAR Y. 

Steamed Eggs. — Butter a tin plate and break in your eggs; 
set in a steamer ; place over a kettle of boiling water, and 
steam until the whites are cooked; they are more orna- 
mental when broken into patty tins, as they keep their form 
better ; the whites of the eggs, when cooked in this manner, 
are tender and light, and not tough and leathery, as if cooked 
by any other process. 

Eggs in this style can be eaten by invalids, and are very 
much richer than by any other method. 

WMrled Eggs. — Put a quart of water, slightly salted, into 
a saucepan over the fire, and keep it at a fast boil. Stir 
with wooden spoon or ladle in one direction until it whirls 
rapidly. Break six eggs, one at a time, into a cup and drop 
each carefully into the centre, or vortex, of the boiling water. 
If kept at a rapid motion, the ^^"g will become a soft, round 
ball. Take it out carefully with a perforated spoon, and put 
it on a slice of buttered toast laid upon a hot dish. Put a 
bit of butter on the top. Set the dish in the oven to keep 
warm, and proceed in the same way with another Q%g, hav- 
ing but one in the saucepan at a time. When all are done, 
dust lightly with salt and pepper and send up hot. 

Eggs a la Mode. — Remove the skin from a dozen tomatoes, 
medium size, cut them up in a saucepan, add a little butter, 
pepper, and salt ; when sufficiently boiled, beat up five or 
six eggs, and just before you serve, turn them into a sauce- 
pan with the tomato, and stir one way for two minutes, allow- 
ing them time to be well done. 

Baked Eggs. — Mix finely chopped ham and bread-crumbs 
in about equal proportions, season with salt and pepper, and 
moisten with milk and a little melted butter ; half fill your 
small patty pans with the mixture, break an ^gg over the 
top of each, sprinkle with fine bread-crumbs, and bake; 
serve hot. 



Baked E^s, No. 2. — Butter a clean, smooth saucepan, break 
as many eggs as will be needed into a saucer, one by one, 
and if found good, slip each into the saucepan. No broken 
yelk must be allowed, nor must they crowd so as to risk 
breaking the yelk after put in. Put a small piece of butter 
on each, and sprmkle with pepper and salt. Set into a well- 
heated oven, and bake till the whites are set. If the oven 
is rightly heated, it will take but a few minutes, and the 
cooking will be far more delicate than fried eggs. 

Eggs sur le Plat. — Melt butter on a stone-china or tin plate. 
Break the eggs carefully into this ; dust lightly with pepper 
and salt, and put on top of the stove until the whites are 
well set. Serve in the dish in which they are baked. 

Scrambled Eggs. — Put into a frying-pan enough butter to 
grease it well ; slip in the eggs carefully without breaking 
the yelks ; add butter, and season to taste ; when the whites 
begin to set, stir the eggs from the bottom of the pan, and 
continue stirring until the cooking is completed. The 
appearance at the end should be marbled^ rather than mixed. 

Scrambled Eggs with. Ham. — Put into a pan, butter, a little 
pepper and salt, and a little milk ; when hot, drop in the 
eggs, and with a knife cut the eggs and scrape them from 
the bottom as the whites begin to set ; add some cold ham 
chopped fine, and when done, sei-ve in a hot dish. 

Toasted Eggs. — Cover the bottom of an earthenware or 
stone-china dish with rounds of delicately toasted bread, or 
with rounds of stale bread dipped in beaten ^^^ and fried 
quickly to a golden-brown in butter or nice dripping. 
Break an ^^^ carefully upon each, and set the dish imme- 
diately in front of a glowing fire. Toast over this as many 
slices of fat salt pork or ham as there are eggs in the dish, 
holding the meat so that it will fry very quickly and all the 
dripping fall upon the eggs. When these are well set, they 
a«e done. Turn the dish several times while toasting the 



122 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

meat, that the eggs may be equally cooked. Do not send 
the pork to table, but pepper the eggs lightly and remove 
with the toast to the dish in which they go to the table. 

Egg Toast. — Beat four eggs, yelks and whites, together 
thoroughly ; put two tablespoonfuls of butter into a sauce- 
pan and melt slowly ; then pour in the eggs and heat, with- 
out boiling, over a slow fire, stirring constantly ; add a little 
salt, and when hot spread on slices of nicely browned toast 
and serve at once. 

Egg Baskets. — Boil quite hard as many eggs as will be 
needed. Put into cold water till cold, then cut neatly into 
halves with a thin, sharp knife; remove the yelk and rub to 
a paste with some melted butter, adding pepper and salt. 
Cover up this paste and set aside till the filling is ready. 
Take cold roast duck, chicken, or turkey, which may be on 
hand, chop fine and pound smooth, and while pounding 
mix in the paste prepared from the yelks. As you pound, 
moisten with melted butter and some gravy which may 
have been left over from the fowls ; set this paste when done 
over hot water till \\\:\\ heated. Cut off a small slice from 
tlie end of the empty halves of the whites, so they will stand 
firm, then fill them with this paste ; place them close to- 
gether on a flat, round dish, and pour over the rest of the 
gravy, if any remains, or make a little fresh. A few spoon- 
fuls of cream or rich milk improves this dressing. 

Fricasseed Eggs. — Boil six eggs hard ; when cold, slice 
with a sharp knife. Have ready some slices of stale bread, 
fried to a nice brown in butter or drippings. Put a cupful 
of good broth in drawn butter over the fire, season it Avith 
pepper, salt, and a trace of onion ; let it come to a boil. 
Dip the slices of o.^^ first into raw (t^^, then into cracker 
dust or bread-crumbs, and lay them gently into the gravy 
upon the side of the range. Do not let it actually boil, lest 
the ^%'g^ should break, but let them lie tlms in tlic gravy at 



EGGS, 123 

least five minutes. Place the fried bread upon a platter, lay 
the sliced eggs evenly upon this, pour the gravy over all, 
and serve hot. 

Curried Eggs. — Boil six or eight fresh eggs quite hard, 
and put them aside until they are cold. Mix well together 
from two to three ounces of good butter, and from three to 
four dessertspoonfuls of currie-powder ; shake them in a 
stewpan, or thick saucepan, over a clear but moderate fire 
for some minutes, then throw in a couple of mild onions 
finely minced, and fry gently until they are soft; pour in by 
degrees from half to three-quarters of a pint of broth or 
gravy, and stew slowly until they are reduced to pulp ; mix 
smoothly a small cup of thick cream with two teaspoonfuls 
of wheaten or rice flour ; stir them to the currie, and simmer 
the whole until the raw taste of the thickening is gone. 
Cut the eggs into half-inch slices, heat them through in the 
sauce without boiling them, and send to the table as hot as 
possible. 

Plain Omelet. — Beat thoroughly yelks of five eggs, and a 
dessertspoonful of flour, rubbed smooth in two-thirds of a 
cupful of milk. Salt and pepper to taste, and add a piece 
of butter the size of a hickory-nut. Beat the whites to a 
stiff froth, pour the mixture into the whites, and without 
stirring pour into a hot, buttered omelet pan. Cook on top 
of the range for five minutes ; then set pan and all into the 
oven to brown the top nicely. 

Baked Omelet.— Beat the yelks of six eggs, and add the 
whites of three eggs beaten very light ; salt and pepper to 
taste^ and a tablespoonful of flour mixed in a cup of milk. 
Pour into a well-buttered pan and put into a hot oven ; 
when thick, pour over it the whites of three eggs beaten 
light; then brown nicely, without allowing the top to be- 
come crusted. Serve immediately.

THE HOUSEWIFE' S LIBRARY, 



Omelet a la Mode. — Beat the yelks and whites of six eggs 
separately until light, then beat together and add one table- 
spoonful of cream. Have in the omelet pan a piece of 
butter ; when the butter is boiling hot, pour in the omelet 
and shake until it begins to stiffen, and then let it brown, and 
season to taste. Fold double and serve hot. 

If a larger omelet is desired, a tablespoonful of milk to 
each ^g^ may be added, and one teaspoonful of corn-starch 
or flour to the whole. 

Cheese Omelet — Butter the sides of a deep dish and cover 
with thin slices of rich cheese ; lay over the cheese thin 
slices of well-buttered bread, first covering the cheese with 
a little red pepper and mustard ; then another layer of cheese ; 
beat the yelk of an ^^^ in a cup of cream or milk, and pour 
over the dish, and put at once into the oven ; bake till nicely 
browned. Serve hot, or it will be tough and hard, but when 
properly cooked it will be tender and savory. 

Meat or Pish Omelet. — Make the same as plain omelet. When 
it is done, scatter thickly over the surface cold, boiled ham, 
tongue, poultry, fish, or lobster, chopped fine, and season 
nicely to taste ; slip the broad knife under one side of the 
omelet and double, inclosing the meat. Then upset the 
frying-pan upon a hot dish, so transferring the omelet with- 
out breaking. Or the minced meat may be stirred in after 
the ingredients are put together, and before cooking. Be 
careful not to scorch the ^g^. 

Omelet with Oysters. — Allow one ^g^ for each person, 
and beat yelks and whites separately, very light ; season 
to taste, and just before cooking add the oysters, which have 
been previously scalded in their own liquor. 

Egg Sandwiches. — Hard boil some fresh eggs, and, when 
cold, cut them into moderately thin slices, and lay them be- 
tween slices of bread and butter cut thin, and season well 



EGGS, 125 

with celery salt. For picnic parties or for traveling, these 
sandwiches are very nice. 

Deviled Eggs. — Boil the eggs hard, remove the shell, and 
cut in two as preferred. Remove the yelks, and add to them, 
salt, cayenne pepper, melted butter, and mixed mustard to 
taste ; then stuff the cavities of the hard whites, and put the 
halves together again. Serve garnished with parsley. For 
picnics, etc., each G.gg can be wrapped in tissue paper to 
preserve its form. 

PicMed Eggs. — Boil the eggs until very hard ; when cold, 
shell them., and cut them in halves lengthways. Lay them 
carefully in large-mouthed jars, and pour over them, scalding 
vinegar, well seasoned with whole pepper, allspice, a few 
pieces of ginger, and a few cloves of garlic. When cold, tie 
up closely, and let them stand a month. They are then fit 
for use. With cold meat, they are a most delicious and 
delicate pickle. 

Egg Balls. — Rub the yelks of hard-boiled eggs with the 
raw yelk of an &gg, well beaten, and season to taste. Roll 
this paste into balls the size of marbles, adding flour if neces- 
sary to thicken, and boil two minutes. A valuable embel- 
lishment and enrichment of soups. 

Soft-boiled Eggs. — Put the eggs in a warm saucepan and 
cover with boiling water. Let them stand where they 
will keep hot, but not boil, for ten minutes. This method 
will cook both whites and yolks. — New Cook Book: 
Miss Maj'ia Parloa. Estes & Laitriat^ Publishers. 

Sweet Omelet. — Beat four eggs without separating ; 
add a piece of butter the size of a walnut and four table- 
spoonfuls of warm water. Put another piece of butter 
in a frying-pan. When melted and hot turn in the ^gg 
and shake until set, then lift carefully the side, drain 
the liquid portion underneath, shake again until the 



126 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

omelet is cooked. Fill the centre with jam and fold 
over one side and then the other. Turn it into another 
heated pan : turn on to a heated dish and serve. 

Creamed Eggs for Lnnclieoii. — One-half dozen hard- 
boiled eggs cut in halves. Make a white sauce as fol- 
lows : Two teaspoonfuls butter, two level tablespoonfuls 
flour ; melt butter and stir in flour ; then add slowly 
one-half pint milk, seasoning with salt and pepper and 
a little celery. Pour over eggs and serve in a dish gar- 
nished with parsley. 

Eggs Scrambled in Tomatoes. — Fry one small slice of 
onion in three tablespoonfuls butter until crisp, then re- 
move onion ; add to the butter one large cup tomato, 
one teaspoonful sugar, one teaspoonful Worcestershire 
sauce. Season wdth salt and pepper and cook five min- 
utes. Add four eggs beaten and cook the same as 
scrambled eggs. Serve with entire wheat or brown 
bread toast. 

Omelet Souffle. — Separate six eggs, beat the whites to 
a very stiff froth ; beat and add the yolks of three, three 
tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar, the grated rind of 
half a lemon, a tablespoonful of lemon juice. Mix 
quickly and turn into a baking dish or form on a platter. 
Dust thickly with powdered sugar and bake in a quick

How t»o get your money back 

Occident Flour is the best flour made. 
There is no doubt about that. 

We know it is best because we make it from North Dakota wheat that is 
proven by analysis to contain the largest amount of gluten and phosphates, those 
basic elements that assure strength, purity and color. 

Our mills, our millers, and our machinery are the best that money can buy. 
And being located in the heart of the famous hard wheat belt, wo can secure the 
very cream of the wheat, before it is shipped to the large cities and mixed with 
cheaper wheat from other parts of the country. 

Because of the extra high-grade wheat used — and because a larger propor- 
tion of the lower-grade flour is taken out* of it* in it»s manufacLure— Ocd- 
dent> Flour costs a littlo bit more than other standard brands of flour. About 50 
cents a barrel more. 

Remember — No matter what price you pay for flour, bread is the cheapest 
food product going on to your table. 

Therefore — Occident Flour is the cheapest flour you can buy because extra 
quality means extra consumption of bread and smaller consumption of more expen- 
sive foods. 

How t»o get your money back — When you buy flour, always buy Occident 

Flour. The grocer from whom you buy it is authorized to refund your money if 
the flour is not found exactly as represented — t»he best* Flour on eart>h. 

If you are unable to get Occident Flour from your dealer, send us his name.

ENTIRE WHEAT FLOUR. 

11 READ prepared from Old Grist Mill Flour is the staff 
^^ of life. One loaf of this bread contains as much 

nourishment as two loaves made from white patent 
flour, which is the ordinary white flour that you buy of the 
grocers. 

Bread made from the Old Grist Mill Entire Wheat 
Flour is so rich in flavor that a few days' use of it makes all 
other breads seem flat and tasteless. It not only contains 
50 per cent more nutriment than white bread, but is nature's 
own remedy for dyspepsia and constipation, brought on by 
the excess of starch in white-flour bread. Apoplexy, Bright's 
disease, and similar disorders have been traced in many cases 
to an excess of starchy foods, and ordinary white bread is the 
most common. 



RECIPES. 

Old Grist Mill Entii-e Wheat Flour can be used for all purposes by the 
same recipes as ordinary flour, except in bread — molasses should be used 
for sweetening instead of white sugar. Use one- half cup molasses to one 
cup wetting. 

ENTIRE WHEAT BREAD (Boston Cooking School.) 

Two cups scalded milk, one-third cup molasses, one teaspoonful salt, 
one-quarter yeast cake, dissolved in one-quarter cup lukewarm water, four 
and one-third cups Old Grist Mill Entire "Wheat Flour. Add sweetening 
and salt to the milk ; cool, and when lukewarm add dissolved yeast cake 
and flour. Beat well, cover and let rise to double its bulk. Again beat 
and turn into greased bread pans, having pans one-half full ; let rise, and 
bake. Old Grist Mill Entire Wheat Bread should not quite double its 
bulk during its last rising. This mixture may be baked in gem pans. 



X.— BREAD, BISCUIT, HOT CAKES, ETC 

AN immense department is opened up by the title of this 
chapter ; and it is a department of immense im- 
portance. Bread is confessedly the "staff of life," 
and, therefore, it should be good. And whatever takes the 
place of bread, be it biscuits, hot cakes, muffins, or what 
not, should also be good, or nothing is gained by the 
exchange. Many a housekeeper can make excellent pies, 
cakes, etc., but when bread is needed, she flies to the bakery, 
confessing her total inability to prepare this indispensable 
commodity. 

But even bread may become distasteful as a steady diet. 
To vary it with the long line of splendid substitutes which 
are possible, and which are discussed in this chapter, is a 
most desirable ability. This department, therefore, is worthy 
of every housewife's devout study. 



I.— BREAD. 

ESSENTIALS TO MAKING GOOD BREAD J HOW TO KNOW GOOD FLOUR ; 
YEAST ; RAISING BREAD j BAKING BREAD. TWELVE RECIPES FOR 
BREAD. 

THREE things are essential to the making of good bread, 
namely, good flour, good yeast, and judicious baking. 
A fourth might be added, experience, without which 
none of the domestic arts can be successfully carried on. 

RECIPES. 

Wheat Bread. — Put seven pounds of flour into a breadpan ; 
hollow out the centre, and add a quart of lukewarm water, 
a teaspoonful of salt, and a wineglassful of yeast. Have 



128 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

ready more warm water, and add gradually as much as will 
make a smooth, soft dough. Knead it well, dust a little 
flour over it, cover it with a cloth, and set it in a warm place 
four hours ; then knead it again for fifteen minutes and let 
it rise again. Divide it into loaves, and prick them with a 
fork, and bake in a quick oven from forty minutes to an 
hour. 

Potato Bread. — Three and one-half quarts of sifted flour, 
three boiled potatoes, one quart warm water, one teacupful 
of yeast, one even tablespoonful salt. Mix at night ; put 
the flour in a large bowl ; hollow a place in the centre for 
the mashed potatoes, water, and salt. Stir in flour enough 
to make a smooth batter ; add yeast ; stir in the rest of the 
flour. Put the dough on the floured board ; knead fifteen 
minutes, using barely enough flour to prevent sticking. 
Flour the bowl, lay the dough in it, cover and leave it to 
rise. In the morning, divide in four parts ; mold into loaves; 
when light, prick, and bake in a moderate oven. 

Salt Eisiiig Bread. — Pour a pint of hot water in a two-quart 
pail or pitcher on one-half tablespoonful of salt ; when it 
has cooled a little, add one and one-third pints of flour ; 
mix well, and leave the pitcher in a kettle of water, as warm 
as that used for mixing. Keep it at the same temperature 
until the batter is nearly twice its original bulk, which will 
be in from five to eight hours. It may be stirred once or 
twice during the rising. Add to this a sponge made of one 
quart of hot water, two and one-half quarts of flour — adding 
as much more as may be necessary to make a soft dough ; 
mix well, and leave in a warm place to rise. When light, 
mold into loaves, keeping them as soft as possible ; lay in 
buttered tins. When light again, prick and bake. 

Milk Bread. — Let two quarts of milk come to a boil; stand 
it aside to cool, and when it becomes tepid, add flour to it 
gradually until it makes a batter just soft enough to beat up 



BREAD, BISCUIT, HOT CAKES, ETC, 129 

with a spoon. To this add one cake of compressed yeast 
thoroughly dissolved in lukewarm water. The batter should 
then be well beaten. Cover with a towel and set in a warm 
place to rise. When light, add two tablespoonfuls of salt, 
one of lard, one of light brown sugar, and flour enough to 
make a soft dough. Knead steadily for about half an hour. 
This quantity should make four or five medium-sized loaves. 
Put them in greased pans and let them rise again. When 
light, prick with a fork and bake in a quick oven. 

Vienna Bread. — The Vienna bread that became so famous 
on the Centennial Exhibition grounds in 1876 was made on 
the following recipe : Sift in a tin pan four pounds of flour ; 
bank up against the sides ; pour in one quart of milk and 
water, and mix into it enough flour to form a thin batter, 
and then quickly and lightly add one pint of milk, in which 
is dissolved one ounce of salt and one and three-quarter 
ounces of yeast ; leave the remainder of the flour against 
the sides of the pan ; cover the pan with a cloth, and set in 
a place free from draught for three quarters of an hour ; 
then mix in the rest of the flour until the dough will leave 
the bottom and sides of the pan, and let it stand two and a 
half hours ; finally, divide the mass into one-pound pieces, 
to be cut in turn into twelve parts each ; this gives square 
pieces about three and a half inches thick, each corner of 
which is taken up and folded over to the centre, and then 
the cases are turned over on a dough-board to rise for half 
an hour, when they are put in a hot oven that will bake 
them in ten minutes. 

Rye Bread. — Scald two handfuls of corn-meal with a quart 
of boiling water, and add a quart of milk and a tablespoonful 
of salt. When cool, add a teacupful of yeast, and enough 
rye flour to make it as stiff as wheat-bread dough. After 
it has risen put it in pans and bake an hour and a half 

Brown Bread. — Take one cup of bread-crumbs, one pint of 



130 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

sweet milk, one cup of molasses, butter the size of an egg, 
one teaspoonful of soda, corn-meal enough to make a stiff 
batter, with salt to taste. Turn the whole into a buttered 
basin and steam for two hours ; then bake in a quick oven 
half an hour. 

Boston Brown Bread.— Take three and three-fourth cupfuls 
of Indian corn-meal, two and one-half cupfuls rye-meal, two- 
thirds cupful molasses, one quart milk, either sweet or sour; 
two even teaspoonfuls soda, dissolved in the milk ; steam in 
a tin pudding boiler five hours ; take off the cover and set 
in the oven to brown. 

Com Bread. — Two heaping cupfuls Indian meal, one cup- 
ful wheat flour, two heaping teaspoonfuls Plume Baking 
Powder; mix well together while dry; one teaspoonful salt, 
two tablespoonfuls white sugar, two eggs, one tablespoonful 
lard, two and a half cupfuls cold milk ; beat the eggs, melt the 
lard, and dissolve the salt and sugar in the milk before add- 
ing them to the flour ; bake in buttered pans in a quick oven. 

Graham Bread. — Three quarts of Graham flour ; one quart 
of warm water; one gill of yeast; one gill of sirup; 
one tablespoonful of salt ; one even teaspoonful of soda. 
Mi3C thoroughly and put in well-buttered pans to rise. Bake 
about an hour and a half 

This same mixture may be thinned and baked in gem 
pans for Graham gems. 

Eice Bread. — After a pint of rice has been boiled soft, mix 
it with two quarts of rice flour or wheat flour. When cold, 
add half a teaspoonful of yeast, a teaspoonful of salt, and 
enough milk to make a soft dough. When it has risen, 
bake in small buttered pans. 

Unleavened Bread. — Mix wheat flour into a stiff dough 
with warm water or milk ; add a little lard, or suet, and bake 
in thin cakes. Bake as soon as mixed, and eat hot

II.— TOAST. 

WHAT TOAST IS GOOD FOR. SIX METHODS OF PREPARING TOAST. 

S a palatable method of disposing of stale bread, as well 
as to furnish a variety of agreeable dishes, toast is an 
important factor in the culinary economy of the home. 
As a dish for invalids it is indispensible. 

RECIPES. 

Dry Toast is produced by browning stale baker's bread 
over glowing coals. A toasting fork, or rack, of which 
there are various patterns, is a great convenience. Do not 
burn the toast, nor allow it to be so browned as to harden it. 
It should be eaten hot, as it becomes tough when allowed 
to cool. 

Buttered Toast. — For buttered toast, the slices should be 
thicker than for dry toast. Butter the slices as toasted, and 
keep warm until served. Excessive buttering should be 
avoided. 

Egg Toast. — On slices of buttered toast lay poached eggs. 
Serve with Worcestershire sauce for breakfast. 

Frencli Toast. — Beat three eggs light, add one cupful of 
milk, with pepper and salt to taste. Dip into this slices of 
bread, then fry them in hot butter to a delicate brown. 

Milk Toast. — Toast the bread an even, delicate brown, aiid 
pile into a hot dish. Boil milk with a little salt, a teaspoon- 
Iful of flour, and one of butter, rubbed together; pour it over 
the toast and serve hot. 

Cream Toast. — Take slices of baker's bread from which 
the crust has been pared and toast it to a golden brown. 
Have on the range a shallow bowl or pudding-dish, more 
than half full of boiling water, in which a tablespoonful of 
butter has been melted. As each slice is toasted, dip in this 



132 THE HOUSEWIFE S LIBRARY. 

for a second, sprinkle lightly with salt, and lay ih the deep 
heated dish in which it is to be served. Have ready, by the 
time all the bread is toasted, a quart of milk scalding hot, 
but not boiling. Thicken this with two tablespoonfuls of 
corn-starch or best flour ; let it simmer until cooked ; put 
in two tablespoonfuls of butter, and when this is melted, the 
beaten whites of three eggs. Boil up once, and pour over 
the toast, lifting the lower slices one by one, that the creamy 
mixture may run in between them. Cover closely, and 
set in the oven two or three minutes before serving. 



III.— FANCY BREADS. 

FANCY BREADS AND PLAIN CAKES j THEIR GENERAL USEFULNESS. 
EIGHT RECIPES FOR FANCY BREADS. 

SOME special preparations come naturally between bread 
and cake. For convenient classification, they are 
grouped here under the title of Fancy Breads, though 
they might as well be classed as Plain Cakes. They serve 
a good purpose for variety, for luncheon, etc. See plainer 
forms of cakes. 

RECIPES. 

Sally Lunn. — One quart of flour, a piece of butter the size 
of an ^%'gj three tablespoonfuls of sugar, two eggs, two tea- 
cupfuls of milk, two teaspoonfuls of cream tartar, one of 
soda, and a little salt. Scatter the cream of tartar, the sugar, 
and the salt into the flour ; add the eggs, the butter (melted), 
and one cup of milk ; dissolve the soda in the remaining cup, 
and stir all together steadily a few moments. Bake in two 
round pans. 

Sally Luim, No. 2. — Rub into a quart of flour two teaspoon- 
fills of baking-powder ; beat together nearly half a cup of 



BREAD, BISCUIT, HOT CAKES, ETC. 133 

butter and two tablespoonfuls of sugar ; put into the flour 
and mix with a pint of milk ; then add two eggs, beaten 
light. Mix and bake as above. 

Johimy Cake. — One quart of buttermilk or sour milk, one 
quart Indian meal, one quart of flour, one cup of molasses, 
a teaspoonful of soda, two scant teaspoonfuls if the milk is 
sour, a teaspoonful of salt. Bake in shallow pans in a quick 
oven. 

Hoe Cake. — Scald one quart of Indian-meal in enough water 
to make a thick batter ; add a teaspoonful of salt, one of 
molasses, and two of butter. Bake on a board before a hot 
lire or in a pan. 

Scotcli Short-cake. — Two pounds of fine flour, one pound 
of fresh, sweet butter, half a pound of finest sifted sugar ; 
throughly knead together without water; roll out to 
half an inch in thickness, and place it on paper in a shallow 
pan ; bake very slowly until of proper crispness. The cake, 
to be good, must be very brittle. 

PumpkiQ Bread. — Stew and strain a sufficient quantity of 
pumpkin ; add enough Indian-meal to stiffen it, with yeast 
and a little salt; when sufficiently raised, bake as in ordi- 
nary bread. 

Pone. — This is a dish prepared by the Indians, called also 
paiLiie. Take two cupfuls of corn-meal, two of wheat flour, 
one of sugar, and half a cup of melted butter. Add one 
Ggg> one teaspoonful of salt, one oi soda, and two of cream 
of tartar. Mix with enough milk to make a moderately 
stiff batter, and bake in a hot oven. 

Barley Bread. — In Scotland, Norway, and other climates 
where wheat is not grown, barley bread is used extensively. 
It is both wholesome and palatable. Mix the barley meal 
with warm water and a little salt, but no yeast. Mix to a 
stiff dough, roll into flat cakes, and bake before the fire or 
in an oven. Eat hot, with butter.

IV.— ROLLS. 

A FAVORITE BREAKFAST DISH. SEVEN VARIETIES OF ROLLS. 

A FAVORITE departure from the ordinary forms of 
bread is furnished in rolls. They are exceedingly pop- 
ular for breakfast, sei-yed warm. There are sufficient 
variations in rolls to make them suitable for use day after 
day, if this be desired. 

RECIPES. 

Plain RoHs. — Boil six potatoes in two quarts of water, and 
when done pour and press the whole through the colander ; 
when cool, but not cold, add flour to make a thick batter ; 
add half a cup of yeast, or one-half cake of compressed yeast, 
and set to rise ; when light, add half a cup of lard and but- 
ter mixed, a tablespoonful of sugar, teaspoonful of salt, and 
flour to make a soft dough ; knead well and set again to 
rise ; when light, knead down again ; repeat three or four 
times ; an hour before they are to be used cut in small 
pieces, roll out, spread with melted butter, and fold over, 
laying them in a pan so that they will not touch each other ; 
set them in a warm place, and when light bake quickly. Or, 
make into an oblong roll without spreading and rolling, and 
just before putting them into the oven, gash deeply across 
the top with a sharp knife. 

EngUsli RoUs.— Two pounds of flour, two ounces of butter, 
three tablespoonfuls of yeast, one pint of warm milk ; mix 
well together, and set in a warm place to rise ; knead, and 
make into rolls ; let them rise again and bake twenty min- 
utes. 

Breakfast RoUs. — One quart of sifted flour, three teaspoon- 
fuls baking-powder, half t aspoonful salt; mix v/ell together 
dry, then add three and half gills of cold milk, or enough 
to make it the consistency of batter, and drop with a spoon

into gem baking-pans, which should have been previously 
heated very hot and buttered. 

French Rolls. — One pint of milk, scalded ; put into it while 
hot half a cupful of sugar, and one tablespoonful of butter ; 
when the milk is cool, add a little salt and half a cupful of 
yeast, or one cake of compressed yeast ; stir in flour enough 
to make a stiff sponge, and when light mix as for bread. 
Let it rise until light, punch it down with the hand, and let 
it rise again, and repeat this process two or three times ; 
then turn the dough on to the molding board, and pound 
with rolling-pin until thin enough to cut. Cut out with a 
tumbler, brush the surface of each one with melted butter, 
and fold over. Let the rolls rise on the tins ; bake, and 
while warm brush over the surface with melted butter to 
make the crust tender. 

Vienna Rolls. — One quart sifted flour, two heaping tea- 
spoonfuls Plume Baking Powder; mix well while dry; then 
add a tablespoonful of butter or lard, made a little soft by 
warming and stirring, and about three-fourths of a pint, or 
enough cold, sweet milk for a dough of usual stiffness, with 
about half a teaspoonful of salt dissolved in it. Mix into a 
dough easily to be handled without sticking ; turn on the 
board and roll out to the thickness of half an inch, cut it 
out with a large cake-cutter, spread very lightly with butter, 
fold one-half over the other, and lay them in a greased pan 
without touching. Wash them over with a little milk, and 
bake in a hot oven. 

Parker House Rolls. — One teacupful of yeast, or one cake 
of compressed yeast, a little salt, one tablespoonful sugar, 
piece of lard size of an &%g, one pint milk, flour sufficient to 
mix. Put the milk on the stove to scald with the lard in it. 
Prepare the flour with salt, sugar, and yeast. Then add the 
milk, not too hot. Knead thoroughly, and when mixed set 
to rise ; when light, knead again slightly. Then roll out

and cut with large biscuit-cutter. Spread a little butter on 
each roll and lap together. Let them rise again very light, 
and bake in a quick oven. 

Geneva Rolls. — Into two pounds of flour break three 
ounces of butter, add a little salt, and make into a sponge 
with yeast, previously mixed with milk and water. Allow 
the batter to rise ; then mix in two eggs, made lukewarm 
by the adding of hot milk, and work the sponge to a light 
dough. Let it stand for three-quarters of an hour longer ; 
mold into small rolls ; place them in buttered pans. When 
light, brush them with beaten yelks of eggs, and bake for 
twenty minutes or half an hour. Serve hot.

RECIPES FOR BISCUITS, BUNS, ETC. 

GREAT care is requisite in making biscuits that quantities 
be accurately observed and that the ingredients used 
are of proper quality. Flour should be a few months 
old. New flour will not make good biscuits. It should 
always be sifted. 

The oven, too, needs careful attention. On its condition 
the success of biscuit baking will depend. Rolls and bis- 
cuit should bake quickly. To make them a nice color, rub 
them over with warm water just before putting them into 
the oven ; to glaze them, brush lightly with milk and sugar 
Baking-powder biscuit and soda biscuit should be made 
as rapidly as possible, laid into hot pans, and put in a 
quick oven. Gem pans should always be heated and well 
greased. 



BREAD, BISCUIT, HOT CAKES, ETC. 137 

RECIPES. 

Potato Biscuit. — Pare ten potatoes, boil them thoroughly, 
and mash fine ; add two cups of lukewarm milk, two table- 
spoonfuls of white sugar, half a cup of yeast, and flour 
enough to make a thin batter. Mix well and allow it to 
rise. Then add four tablespoonfuls of melted butter, a little 
salt, and enough flour to make a soft dough. Let this rise 
again ; roll into a sheet about an inch thick, and cut into 
cakes. Set to rise again, and bake in a quick oven. 

Light Biscuit. — When kneading bread, set aside a small 
loaf for biscuits. Into this, work a heaping tablespoonful of 
lard and butter mixed and a teaspoonful of sugar. The 
more it is worked the whiter it Avill be. As it rises, 
mold it down twice before making into biscuit. Roll out 
and cut with a biscuit-cutter. The dough should be quite 
soft. 

Soda Biscuits. — One quart of flour, a tablespoonful of but- 
ter and two of lard, a teaspoonful of salt, and one teaspoon 
even full of cream of tartar, one teaspoonful of soda ; sift 
the cream tartar with the flour dry ; rub the butter and lard 
very thoroughly through it ; dissolve the soda in a pint of 
milk and mix all together. Roll out, adding as little flour 
as possible; cut with a biscuit-cutter, and bake twenty 
minutes in a quick oven. 

Tea Biscuit. — Take one quart sifted flour, one tablespoon- 
ful shortening, half teaspoonful salt, and two teaspoonfuls 
Plume baking-powder; mix well together dry, then add 
sufficient cold milk or water to form a very soft dough ; 
bake immediately in a quick oven. 

Cream Biscuits. — Dissolve one teaspoonful of soda in a 
quart of sour cream, add to it flour sufficient to make a soft 
dough and a little salt ; or use sour milk^ and rub a table- 
spoonful of butter into the flour. 



138 THE HO USE WIFE'S LIBRAE Y. 

Graham Biscuits. — Take one quart of water or milk, butter 
the size of an ^^^, three tablespoonfuls sugar, two of baker's 
yeast, and a pinch of salt ; take enough white flour to use 
up the water, making it the consistency of batter cakes ; 
add the rest of the ingredients and as much Graham flour 
as can be stirred in with a spoon ; set it away till morning-, 
in the morning grease the pan, flour your hands ; take a 
lump of dough the size of a large ^^^, roll it lightly be- 
tween the palms, and let the biscuits rise twenty minutes, 
then bake in a tolerably hot oven. 

Maryland Biscuits. — Take three pints of sifted flour, one 
tablespoonful of good lard, one pint of cold water, salt to 
the taste; make into a stiff dough ; work it till it cracks or 
blisters, then break, but do not cut it, into suitable portions, 
and make into biscuits ; stick the top of each with a fork 
and bake. 

YorksMre Biscuits. — Make a batter with flour sufficient and 
one quart of boiling hot milk. When the batter has cooled 
to lukewarmness, add a teacupful of yeast and a half tea- 
spoonful of salt. Set to rise again and let it become very 
light ; then stir in a half teaspoonful of soda, two eggs, and 
a tablespoonful of melted butter. Add flour enough to 
make the dough into small, round cakes ; let them rise fifteen 
minutes, and bake in a slow oven. 

Short Biscuits. — Mix one quart of flour with a quarter 
pound of butter melted in boiling water. Add enough cold 
milk to make a stiff dough. Work into small biscuits and 
bake in a quick oven. 

Flavored Biscuits. — Biscuit dough made as for Light Bis- 
cuit may be flavored with any essence, or with lemon or 
orange peel, as desired. 

Tea Rusk. — Three cups of flour, one cup of milk, three- 



BREAD, BISCUIT, HOT CAKES, ETC. 139 

fourths of a cup of sugar, two heaping tablespoonfuls of 
butter, melted ; two eggs, three teaspoonfuls baking-powder. 
Let them rise, and bake in a moderate oven. Glaze while 
hot with white of ^^'g, in which has been stirred, not beaten, 
a little powdered sugar, or sift the powdered sugar in while 
tlie Q<g<g is still moist on the top. Rusks should never be 
eaten hot. 

Sweet Rusk. — One pint of warm milk — new is best — one- 
half cup of butter, one cup of sugar, two eggs, one tea- 
spoonful of salt, two tablespoonfuls of yeast ; make a sponge 
with the milk, yeast, and enough flour to make a thin bat- 
ter, and let it rise over night. In the morning add the 
sugar, butter, eggs, and salt, well beaten up together, with 
enough flour to make a soft dough ; let it rise again ; then 
work out into round balls, and set to rise a third time. Bake 
in a moderate oven. 

Buns. — One cupful of warm water, one cupful of sweet milk, 
yeast and sugar, with flour enough to make a stiff* batter ; 
let this rise over night ; in the morning add a cupful of 
sugar, a cupful of raisins or currants, mold well ; let it rise till 
light, then make into buns ; rise again till very light, and 
bake. Use any spice desired. 

Hot Cross Buns. — Three cupfuls sweet milk ; one cupful of 
yeast ; flour to make thick batter. Set this as a sponge over 
night. In the morning add one cupful of sugar ; one-half 
cupful butter, melted ; half a nutmeg ; one saltspoonful salt, 
and flour enough to roll out like biscuit. Knead well, and 
set to rise five hours. Roll half an inch thick, cut into 
round cakes, and lay in rows in a buttered baking-pan. 
When they have stood half an hour, make a cross upon 
each with a knife, and put instantly into the oven. Bake to 
a light brown, and brush over with a feather or soft bit of 
rag, dipped in the white of an o,^^ beaten up stiff with white 
sugar.

KINDRED PREPARATIONS ; MUFFIN-RINGS AND WAFFLE-IRONS ; 
WHEN TO USE MUFFINS AND WAFFLES; HOW TO SERVE THEM. 
ELEVEN RECIPES FOR MUFFINS AND WAFFLES. 

MUFFINS are baked in rings on a griddle, or in gem- 
pans, over a quick fire. Waffles are baked in waffle- 
irons, which inclose the batter and imprint both sides 
of the cake as it rises in the process of baking. Both muf- 
fins and waffles form a medium between bread and biscuits 
on the one side and griddle-cakes on the other. Muffln- 
rings were formerly about four inches in diameter, but now, 
with better taste, they are used much smaller. The approved 
waffle-irons of to-day are circular, baking four waffles at 
once, and suspended on a pivot that permits them to be 
turned with a touch of the fork. Both mufiflns and waffles 
are suitable for tea, and with stewed chicken and such deli- 
cacies they are really delicious. They should always be 
served hot and with the best of butter. Waffles and catfish 
are a famous dish at some eating-houses. 

RECIPES. 

Muffins. — Two eggs lightly beaten, one quart of flour, one 
teaspoonful of salt, three teaspoonfuls of Plume baking- 
powder, one tablespoonful of melted butter, one pint of 
milk, and two teaspoonfuls of vanilla extract, if liked. 
Beat up quickly to the consistency of a cake batter; bake in 
buttered gem-pans in a hot oven. 



BREAD, BISCUIT, HOT CAKES, ETC. 141 

Muffins, No. 2. — One cup of home-made yeast or half of a 
compressed yeast cake, one pint of sweet milk, two eggs, 
two tablespoonfuls of melted butter, two tablespoonfuls of 
sugar. Beat the butter, sugar, and eggs well together ; then 
stir in the milk, slightly warmed, and thicken with flour to 
the consistency of griddle.-cakes. When light, bake in muffin- 
rings or on a griddle. If wanted for tea, the batter should 
be mixed immediately after breakfast. Muffins should never 
be cut with a knife, but be pulled open with the fingers. 

Rice Muffins. — Take one quart of sour milk, three well- 
beaten eggs, a little salt, a teaspoonful of soda, and enough 
of rice flour to thicken to a stiff batter. Bake in rings. 

Hominy Muffins. — Substitute hominy, well cooked and 
mashed, for the rice, and proceed as above. 

Bread Muffins. — Cut the crust off four thick slices of bread ; 
put them in a pan and pour on them just enough boiling 
water to soak them thoroughly. Let them stand an hour, 
covered ; then drain off the water and stir the bread to a 
smooth paste. Stir in two tablespoonfuls of flour, a half 
pint of milk, and three well-beaten eggs. Bake to a delicate 
brown in well-buttered muffin-rings. 

Graham Muffins. — One quart of Graham flour, two tea- 
spoonfuls of baking-powder, a piece of butter the size of a 
walnut, one ^^^y one tablespoonfial of sugar, one-half tea- 
spoonful of salt, milk enough to make a batter as thick as 
for griddle-cakes. Bake in gem-pans or muffin-rings in a 
hot oven. 

Com Muffins. — Mix two cupfuls of corn-meal, two cupfuls 
of flour, one cupful of sugar, half a cupful of melted butter, 
two eggs, and one teaspoonful of salt. Dissolve one tea- 
spoonful of soda and two of cream tartar in a little milk, and 
beat it through. Add milk enough to make a moderately 
stiff batter, and bake in rings or gem-pans. 



1 42 ^-^^ ^^ ^^^ WIFE' S LIBRAR Y. 

Cnunpets. — Three cupfuls of warm milk, half a cupful of 
yeast, two tabiespoonfuls of melted butter, one saltspoonful 
each of salt and soda dissolved in hot water, flour enough 
to make a good batter. Set these ingredients — leaving out 
the butter and soda— as a sponge. When very light, beat 
in the melted butter, with a very little flour ; stir in the soda 
hard, fill patty-pans or muflin-rings with tlie mixture, and 
let them stand fifteen minutes before baking. 

Raised Waffles. — One quart of warm milk, one tablespoon- 
ful of butter, three eggs, one gill of yeast, one tablespoon- 
ful of salt, and flour to make a stiff batter. Set to rise, and 
bake in waffle-irons, which must be v/ell heated before used. 

Quick Waffles. — One quart flour, two teaspoonfuls Plume 

Baking Powder,one teaspoonful salt ; mix dry ; then stir in 

one tablespoonful melted butter, two well-beaten eggs, and 

enough cold, sweet milk for a batter thin enough to pour ; 

bake at once in waffle-irons. 

Rice Waffles. — Mix a teacupful and a half of boiling rice 
with a pint of milk, rubbing it smooth over the fire. Take 
from the fire and add a pint of cold milk and a teaspoonful 
of salt. Stir in four well-beaten eggs with enough flour to 
make a thin batter, and bake as above. Waffles should 
always be served hot. Powdered sugar with a flavor of 
powdered cinnamon makes a pleasing dressing for them.

CAKES made of a batter so thin that it flows easily upon 
a griddle, and that can, therefore, be quickly baked 
and be served hot, are griddle-cakes, and great favorites 
they are. 



BREAD, BISCUIT, HOT CAKES, ETC. J 43 

All new griddles are hard to manage, but as the only way 
to get old ones is to make them out of new ones, we are 
shut up to the necessity of using the new, though they do 
not work so well. Opinions divide between iron griddles 
and those of soapstone. The latter require no greasing. 
Hence trouble is saved, and the smoke of the fat used in 
the constant greasing of a hot iron griddle ts entirely 
avoided. But still, many housekeepers prefer the old style. 

A hot griddle is essential to good griddle-cakes. But it 
must not be hot enough to burn before it bakes. A cold 
griddle will make cakes tough, unpalatable, and decidedly 
unwholesome. 

Hot cakes may well be served with powdered sugar, 
Golden Tree Brand Maple Syrup or any molasses in 
the market. Cold days are the gala days for hot cakes. 
Time immemorial, buckwheat cakes and sausage have gone 
to the table side by side. There is delightful harmony in 
this union ; but to serve hot cakes and fish together would 
introduce discord into the best regulated family. There is 
an eminent fitness between hot cakes and certain other 
dishes, and it must never be disregarded. 

RECIPES. 

Buckwheat Cakes. — One quart of buckwheat-meal, one 
pint of wheat-flour or Indian-meal, half a teacupful of yeast, 
.salt to taste ; mix the flour, buckwheat, and salt with as 
much water moderately warm as will make it into a thin 
batter; beat it well, then add the yeast ; when well mixed, 
set it in a warm place to rise ; as soon as it is very light, 
grease the griddle and bake the cakes to a delicate brown. 
Butter them with good butter and serve hot. 

Gh?aliani Griddle-cakes. — Scald a cupful of Indian-meal in a 
pint of boiling water, and strain it over night. Thin it with 
a quart of milk, and make into a sponge with a cupful of 



1 44 THE HO USE WIFE' S LIBRAE Y. 

Graham flour, a large tablespoonful of molasses, and half a 
cupful of yeast In the morning, add salt to taste, a cupful 
of white flour, half a teaspoonful of soda, dissolved in hot 
water, and a tablespoonful of butter or lard. Stir in enough 
water to make batter of the right consistency, and bake on 
a hot griddle. 

Flannel Cakes. — Three eggs, one quart of sweet milk, about 
one quart of flour, a small teaspoonful of salt, two table- 
spoonfuls of prepared baking-powder ; beat the yelks, and 
half of the milk, salt, and flour together ; then the remainder 
of the milk ; and last, the whites of the eggs well beaten. 
Bake in small cakes on a hot griddle. 

Flannel Cakes, No. 2. — One quart of milk, three eggs, one 
cupful of yeast, one dessertspoonful of salt, flour enough for 
a thinnish batter, and a teaspoonful of butter ; set to rise ; 
bake like buckwheat cakes. Cakes half Indian and half 
wheat are very nice, and good cakes may be made even 
without the eggs. 

Rice Cakes. — Soak a cupful of rice five or six hours in 
enough warm water to cover it. Then boil slowly till soft. 
While still warm, but not hot, stir in a tablespoonful of but- 
ter^ a tablespoonful of sugar, a teaspoonful of salt, and a 
quart of milk. When cold, add three eggs, beaten very 
light. Sift a half teaspoonful of cream of tartar into a 
quarter cupful of rice flour, and add them to the batter, first 
beating into it a quarter teaspoonful of soda dissolved in hot 
water. 

Rice Cakes, No. 2. — Boil a cupful of rice until quite soft, 
setting it aside until cool. Beat three eggs very light, and 
put them into the rice, with a pint of flour, into which you 
have sifted three teaspoonfuls of prepared baking-powder. 
Add a teaspoonful of butter and one of salt, making it into 
a batter with a quart of milk. Bake on a griddle. 



BREAD, BISCUIT, HOT CAKES, ETC, I45 

Hominy Cakes. — Mix with cold boiled hominy an equal 
quantity of white flour until perfectly smooth ; add a tea- 
spoonful of salt and thin off with buttermilk, in part of 
which a teaspoonful of soda has been dissolved ; when of 
the proper consistency for griddle cakes, add a dessertspoon- 
ful of melted butter, and bake as usual. 

Sour Milk Cakes. — One pint sour milk, one teaspoonful of 
soda, a little salt, two eggs, and flour to make a thin batter ; 
bake on a hot griddle. 

Mian Griddle Cakes. — One large cupful Indian-meal, four 
tablespoonfuls of wheat flour, two tablespoonfuls of Plume 
baking-powder, one teaspoonful salt, mix together dry, then 
add sufficient cold water for a batter ; bake at once on a hot 
griddle. 

Slapjacks. — One pint of milk, three eggs, one teaspoonful 
of soda, and one of salt, flour enough to make a thin bat- 
ter. Butter your griddle, and fry them the size of a tea- 
plate ; when one is done, turn it on the dish, sprinkle with a 
little white sugar, and continue in this way till they are all 
fried. Always fry them with butter. A little nutmeg may 
be grated with the sugar on each cake. 



VIII.— YEAST AND YEAST CAKES. 

NATURE OF YEAST ; ACTION OF YEAST IN DOUGH ; CAUSES OF LIGHT 
BREAD AND HEAVY BREAD ; CARE OF YEAST. TWO RECIPES FOR 
YEAST AND YEAST CAKES. 

IN this chapter, yeast has been so often referred to that its 
special consideration seems important just here. An- 
alytically considered, it consists of an innumerable 
quantity of infinitesimal fungi, called the yeast-plant. The 
remarkable characteristic of these minute plants is, that 
under favoring conditions they multiply to an incredible 
10

extent in a very short time. Thus the production of yeast, 
in proper mixtures, is an easy matter. 

When yeast is placed in dough, it immediately produces 
fermentation, in the process of which gases are generated, 
which permeate the dough, filling it with gas-vessels and so 
producing the spongy appearance so familiar in raised 
bread. If this process goes too far, it sours the dough and 
unfits it for food. If arrested by placing the dough in a 
hot oven, the gases will be driven off by the heat, and the 
thin dough walls will be set and baked. If the oven be 
slow, the gases will be driven off, the dough wall5 will col- 
lapse, and heavy bread will be the result. The proper use 
of yeast is most important, therefore. It must be watched 
as carefully as any other tender plant. Excessive heat or 
cold, or rough mechanical usage will quickly destroy it. 

RECIPES. 

Patent Yeast. — Boil two ounces of hops in four quarts of 
water for a half hour. Strain and cool till lukewarm, then 
add a handful of salt, a half pound of sugar, and a pound 
of flour, all mixed well and beaten up together. After it 
has stood forty-eight hours, add three pounds of potatoes, 
boiled and well-mashed. Let it stand twenty-four hours, 
stirring it often ; then strain and bottle. It is ready for im- 
mediate use, or will keep several months. Keep in a cool 
place. 

Yeast Cakes. — Thicken good yeast with Indian-meal till it 
becomes a stiff batter. A little lye will make it adhere bet- 
ter. Make into cakes an inch thick and two by three inches 
in area. Dry them in the air, but not in the sun. Keep 
them in a bag in a cool, dry place. One of these cakes is 
enough for four quarts of flour. To use them, soak in 
milk or water several hours and use as other yeast.

XL— PASTRY AND PUDDINGS. 

CARE IN INGREDIENTS AND MANIPULATION ESSENTIAL ; KEEP IN- 
GREDIENTS COOL ; MIX quickly; how to shorten; how to 
roll; the filling; the baking. eighty-seven recipes 
for pastry and puddings. 

THAT pastry may be wholesome and appetizing, great 
care in the selection of ingredients and in their ma- 
nipulation is absolutely essential. One fact must 
always be borne in mind — that inferior ingredients cannot be 
made into superior compounds — though the finest ingre- 
dients may be ruined by careless or unskillful handling. 
Some suggestions of general application are therefore de- 
sirable. 

Be careful to have all the materials cool, and the butter and 
lard hard ; use cold water (ice-water if convenient) ; use a 
cool knife, and work on a marble slab if it can be had. 

Put the ingredients together quickly, handling as little as 
possible ; slow mixing and much contact with the hands 
or fingers make tough crust. Always use well-sifted flour. 

Except in puff-paste, lard and butter in about equal pro- 
portions make the best crust ; if made of butter alone, it is 
almost sure to be tough. That of lard alone, though ten- 
der, is usually white and insipid. Beef drippings, or the 
drippings of fresh pork, make a very light and palatable 
crust, lighter and more tender indeed than that made with 
butter alone, much better tasted than that made with lard 
alone, and quite equal to that made with butter and lard 
combined. Never use mutton drippings in crust. 

Use very little salt and very little water ; pour the latter 
in gradually, only a few drops at a time, unless you want 
tough crust. 



148 ^^^ ^^ ^^^ WIFE' S L TBRAR Y. 

Use plenty of flour on your paste-board, to keep the paste 
from sticking. Work the crust of one pie at a time, and 
always roll from you — one way only. 

The filling for the pie should be perfectly cool when put 
in, or it will make the bottom crust heavy. 

In making juicy pies, cut a slit in the top to let the steam 
escape, else the pie will be puffed unduly. 

The oven should be hot, but not sufficiently so to scorch 
or to set the paste before it has had time to rise ; if too 
slack, the paste will not rise at all, but will be white and 
clammy. The best paste has a tinge of yellow. If per- 
mitted to scorch or brown, even the best paste becomes 
rancid. 

RECIPES. 

Pie Crust. — Take one-half cupful of lard, one-half cupful 
of butter, one quart of sifted flour, one cupful of cold water 
and a little salt. Rub the butter and lard slightly into the 
flour ; wet it with the water, mixing it as little as possible. 
This quantity will make two large or three small pies. 

Pie Crust Glaze. — To prevent juice from soaking the under 
crust, beat up the white of an ^g%, and before filling the pie, 
brush over the crust with the beaten ^g%. Brush over the 
top crust also, to give it a beautiful yellow brown. 

Puff Paste. — Take one pound of sifted flour, on which 
sprinkle a very little sugar ; take the yelks of one or two 
eggs, and beat into them a little ice-water, and pour gently 
into the centre of the flour, and work into a firm paste, 
adding water as is necessary ; divide three-quarters of a 
pound or a pound of firm, solid butter, as you prefer, into 
three parts ; roll out the paste, and spread one part of the 
butter on half of the paste ; fold the other half over, and 
roll out again, repeating the process until the butter is all 
rolled in ; then set the paste on the ice for fifteen or twenty 



PASTRY AND PUDDINGS. 149 

minutes, after which roll out again three times, each time 
rolling it the opposite direction ; then put on the ice again 
until cold, when it is ready for use. Such paste will keep 
several days in a refrigerator, but should not be allowed to 
ireeze. 

Paste Shells. — Take sufficient rich puff-paste prepared as 
in the preceding recipe, roll /ery thin, cut to shape, and bake 
in a brisk oven in tin pans. Baked carefully, before fill- 
ing with fruit, the paste rises better. When cool, the shells 
may be filled with stewed fruit, jelly, preserves, rich cream 
whipped to a stiff froth, raspberries, strawberries, or sliced 
peaches. These are delicious light desserts. Raspberries, 
strawberries, or sliced peaches, smothered with whipped 
cream on these shells, are really exquisite. 

Apple Pie. — Line a pie plate with paste, and fill it heaping 
full with tart apples, sliced very thin. Sweeten and spice to 
taste, mixing well into the apples. Put in plenty of butter, 
and moisten well with cream. Bake until the apples are 
thoroughly done. Use no upper crust. 

Apple Meringue Pie. — Stew and sweeten ripe, juicy apples. 
Mash smooth, and season with nutmeg. Fill the crust, and 
bake until just done. Spread over the apple a thick me- 
ringue, made by whipping to a stiff froth the whites of three 
eggs tor each pie, sweetening with a tablespoonful of pow- 
dered sugar for each Qgg. Flavor this with vanilla ; beat 
until it will stand alone, and cover the pie three-quarters of 
an inch thick. Set back in the oven until the meringue is 
well set. Eat cold. 

Peach Meringne Pie. — Proceed as above in all respects, 
simply substituting peaches for apples. Whipped cream 
will make a delightful substitute for the whipped &gg in 
either of these meringue pies. 

Peach Pie. — Bake rich shells about two-thirds done; if 
your peaches are fully ripe, cut them into halves or quarters^, 



150 THE HO USE WIFE'S LIBRAE Y. 

put in the shell, sweeten and flavor to taste, cover or not as 
you choose, and finish baking in a quick oven ; if the 
peaches are ripe, but not soft, it will improve the flavor to 
sugar them down some hours before you wish to use them ; 
if not ripe, they should be stewed. 

Grooseberry Pie. — Stew the gooseberries with plenty of 
white sugar, and use plain puff-paste for crust 

ClieiTy Pie. — Having removed the stones, put in sugar as 
may be needed, and stew the cherries slowly till they are 
quite done, if you use shells, or till nearly done if you use 
paste. A few of the pits added in stewing increase the 
richness of the flavor ; but they should not go into the pies. 
If baked slowly the cherries need not be stewed at all. 

Rhubarb Pie. — Remove the skin from the stalks ; cut them 
in small pieces ; pour boiling water over and let stand for 
ten minutes ; drain thoroughly ; then fill the pie-dish evenly 
full ; put in plenty of sugar, a little butter, and dredge a 
trifle of flour evenly over the top ; cover with a thin crust, 
and bake the same as apple pie. Equal quantities of apple 
and rhubarb used in the same manner make a very good pie. 

Pumpkiii Pie. — Stew the pumpkin until thoroughly done, 
and pass it through a colander. To one quart of stewed 
pumpkin, add three eggs, and one pint of milk. Sweeten, 
and spice with ground ginger and cinnamon to taste. Add 
butter, rose water, and a little brandy. The quantity of 
milk used will vary as the pumpkin may be moist or dry. 

Sweet Potato Pie. — Scrape clean two good-sized sweet pota- 
toes ; boil ; when tender, rub through the colander ; beat 
the yelks of three eggs light ; stir with a pint of sweet milk 
into the potato ; add a small teacupful of sugar, a pinch of 
salt; flavor with a little fresh lemon, or lemon extract; 
bake to a nice brown ; when done, make a meringue top with 
the whites of eggs and powdered sugar ; brown this a 
moment m the oven.

hot blanc-mange or corn-starch. When cold, break off the 
shells, and lay the molded eggs in the nest. 

Snow Pudding. — Soak an ounce of gelatine in a pint of 
cold water for one hour ; then place it over the fire, stir 
gently, and remove as soon as it is dissolved ; when almost 
cold, beat to a stiff froth with an egg-beater. Beat the 
whites of three eggs to a stiff froth, and add it to the 
gelatine froth, together with the juice of three lemons, and 
pulverized sugar to the taste. Mix the whole well together, 
pour into a mold, and set aside to cool. Serve on a dish 
with soft custard made from the yelks of the eggs. 

Cherry Pudding. — Two eggs, one cupful sweet milk, flour 
enough to make a stiff batter, two teaspoonfuls of baking- 
powder, and as many cherries as can be stirred in. Eat with 
sauce made of the cherries. 

Blackberry MusL — Put the berries into a preserving kettle 
and mash with sugar enough to make sweet ; set over the 
fire, and when it begins to simmer, stir in very gradually 
one tablespoonful, or more if needed, of corn-starch to a 
quart of fruit ; stir until well cooked, and eat either hot 
or cold with cream ; raspberries also may be used this way. 

Roley-poley. — Make a good biscuit dough, and roll about 
three-quarters of an inch thick, and spread with berries, 
preserves, or slices of apple ; roll up and tie in a cloth ; boil 
or steam an hour and a half 

Berry or Fniit Puddings. — One quart sifted flour, two table- 
spoonfuls shor^-ening, half teaspoonful salt, and two tea- 
spoonfuls baking-powder ; mix well, then form a soft dough 
of milk or water, roll out thin, and spread with any kind of 
berries, fruit, or preserves ; roll it up, tie in a cloth, and 
place in the steamer, or boil in a mold. This makes fine 
dumplings.

that I have made a Chemical Analysis of 




^ - • _ . . , - the Compound Concentrated Extract of 

Water-White Vanilla made by the Theodore Metcalf Co. of 
Boston. I have been informed by them of the full details of their 
process, and I have repeatedly witnessed the same in practical 
operation in their laboratory. I am able to report as follows : 
The compound extract of Water-White Vanilla is prepared as 
follows. Vanilla Beans, in quantity fully equal to the amount required by 
standard formulas, or as shown by analysis to be employed by the best known 
manufacturers, are treated in the usual manner with alcohol, as in the prep- 
aration of all Vanilla Extracts. From this product thus obtained from the 
bean itself, all coloring matter and all constituents which tend to deteriorate 
the extract either in aroma, flavor or keeping qualities, are removed by a new 
and original process discovered and exclusively practiced by the. Theodore 
Metcalf Co. The extract of Vanilla thus obtained is water-white, and when its 
aroma and flavor are still further developed by unobjectionable additions, 
under conditions which secure the perfect keeping qualities of this product, it 
is ready for use and is put upon the market. It is absolutely free from any 
constituent whose presence is not authorized by standard and accepted formulas 
for the preparation of extract of vanilla. 

I have examined the extract of Vanilla contained in original unbroken 
packages made by three of the best known manufacturers in this vicinity, and 
I have made comparative tests of these and of the " Water- White Vanilla." As 
the result of these tests I am able to state that the latter has the following 
distinct points of superiority : — 

FIRST. The clean and agreeable flavor and aroma, with no unpleasant 
aftertaste, of the " Water- White Vanilla, " are markedly superior to either of 
the other extracts. 

SECOND. The strength or flavoring capacity of the «' Water- White 
Vanilla " is from one and a half to two and a half times as great as that of either 
of the other extracts. This may be easily verified by anyone who cares to try 
the experiment. 

THIRD. The " Water- White Vanilla " is free from color. 
FOURTH. The keeping qualities of the " Water- White Vanilla " are un- 
impaired by unstable extractive matters or other objectionable substances. 

FIFTH. The " Water- White Vanilla" will not become cloudy with age 
or deposit a muddy and unsightly sediment, however long kept.

RECIPES FOR CREAMS, JELLIES, BLANC-MANGES, ETC. 



THERE is a delightful range of light desserts which need 
to be introduced more generally into our homes. 
They have too long been allowed to rest in the con- 
fectioner's under the erroneous notion that they were be- 
yond the capacity of the ordinary housekeeper. 

Prominent among these desserts are ice-cream and water- 
ices with all their splendid possibilities of variety. 



RECIPES. 

Vanilla Ice-cream. — Two quarts of pure cream, fourteen 
ounces of white sugar, flavored with vanilla bean or extract 
of vanilla to taste ; mix v/ell, and freeze as directed 
above. Pure cream needs no thickening or boiling. Milk 
may be boiled or thickened with arrow-root or corn- 
starch, but it will not produce ice cream. 

Lemon Ice-cream. — For the same quantity of cream and 
sugar, as above, stir in the juice of from four to eight 
lemons, according to size and juiciness, and grate in a little 
of the rind. Then freeze as above. 

Orange Ice-cream. — Proceed as in lemon cream, using 
oranges, and regulating the quantity of sugar as the fruit is 
more or less sweet. 



168 THE HO USE WIFE'S LIBRARY, 

Chocolate Ice-cream. — For one gallon of ice-cream, grate 
fine about one-half cake of Bensdorp's Chocolate; make 
ice-cream as for the recipe above ; flavor lightly with 
Metcalf's Water White Vanilla and stir in the chocolate. 

Strawberry Ice-cream. — Mash one pint of fresh, ripe straw- 
berries ; sprinkle them with half a pound of fine sugar ; let 
it stand about an hour ; strain though a fine sieve, or a 
cloth ; if the sugar is not dissolved, stir it well ; add a little 
water; stir this juice into the cream prepared as above and 
freeze. 

Raspberry Ice-cream. — Make the same as strawberry, sub- 
stituting the raspberries merely. 

Peach Ice-cream. — Take fine, ripe freestone peaches ; pare, 
chop fine, mash, and work as for strawberry cream. 

Pine-apple Ice-cream. — Pare the fruit, shred fine, and work as 
in strawberry cream. 

Orange Water-ice. — Take one dozen oranges ; grate the 
skin and squeeze out the juice; add six quarts of water 
and ten ounces of white sugar to each quart of water ; mix 
well and put into the freezer. Be careful to stir steadily 
while freezing, or the mixture will cake into lumps. The 
amount of sugar and of orange-juice may be varied to suit 
taste. 

Lemon "Water-ice. — To one quart ot water, add the juice of 
four lemons and one pound of sugar. Then proceed as 
above. Currants, raspberries, strawberries, and all the juicy 
fruits may be treated in the same way. 

Tutti FruttL — One quart of rich cream, one and one-half 
ounces of sweet almonds, chopped fine ; one-half pound 
of sugar ; freeze, and when sufficiently congealed, add ono- 



CREAMS, JELLIES, AND LIGHT DESSERTS. 1^9 

half pound of preserved fruits, with a few white raisins 
chopped, and finely sliced citron. Cut the fruit small, and 
mix well with the cream. Freeze like ice-cream, and keep 
on ice until required. 

Frozen Pmits. — Take two quarts of rich cream and two 
teacupfuls of sugar, mix well together and put into a freezer 
with ice and salt packed around it. Have ready one quart 
of peaches, mashed and sweetened. When the cream is 
very cold, stir them in and freeze all together. Strawberries 
can be used in the same way, but will require more sugar. 
Cherries are specially delightful in this form. 

WMpped Cream.— To one quart of cream whipped very 
thick, add powdered sugar to taste ; then add one tumbler 
of wine. Make just before usinp-. 

Italiaja Cream. — Divide two pints of cream equally in two 
bowls ; with one bowl mix six ounces of powdered sugar, 
the juice of two large lemons, and two glassfuls of white 
wine ; then add the other pint of cream, and stir the whole 
very hard ; boil two ounces of isinglass with four small tea- 
cupfuls of water till reduced one-half; then stir the isinglass, 
lukewarm, in the other ingredients ; put them in a glass dish 
to harden. 

Syllabub. — Whip a small cupful of powdered sugar into a 
quart of rich cream, and another cupful of sugar into tlie 
whites of four eggs. Mix these together, and add a glass 
of white wine and flavoring to taste. 

Spanish Cream. — Soak one-half box of 5wampscott 
Sparkling Gelatine in one-half cup water fifteen minutes ; 
add three pints milk, one cup sugar, one teaspoonful of 
Metcalf's Water White Vanilla, and yolks of six eggs ; 
cook ten mmutes ; stir constantly. Add whites beaten 
to stiff froth ; beat five minutes. Mould and cool. 



170 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Strawberry Sherbet. — Dissolve one tablespoonful gela- 
tine in half pint of water ; add juice of one lemon ; pour 
over one quart of mashed strawberries mixed with one 
pint of sugar; freeze in the same manner as ice-cream. 

Tapioca Cream. — Soak half a cupful of tapioca in water 
over night. Let a quart of milk get steaming hot, and add 
to it the tapioca. Let it boil three minutes, then mix five 
tablespoonfuls of white sugar with the yelks of four eggs ; 
stir them into the milk and tapioca, and let it come to a boil 
again. Beat the whites up stiff; stir them rapidly and 
thoroughly through the boiling tapioca ; add two table- 
spoonfuls of wine and a pinch of salt. Let it stand till 
cold and garnish with macaroons. 

Orange Cream. — Put half a box of gelatine to soak for half 
an hour in cold water enough to cover it. Take three half- 
pints of cream, whip half of it, and heat the other half; dis- 
solve the gelatine in the heated cream ; then strain it, and 
return to the boiler again. Take the yelks of five eggs and 
a cupful of sugar ; beat them together till light, and add to 
the boiling cream ; cook about tv/o minutes, stirring con- 
stantly ; take from the fire, and while it cooks, stir in the 
whipped cream and the juice of four oranges, and pour into 
a mold to stiffen. Stir the cream constantly before putting 
into the mold, to prevent it from thickening in lumps. 

Pink Cream. — Three gills of strawberry or currant juice ; 
mix with one-half pound of pov/dered sugar, one-half pint of 
thick cream ; whisk until well mixed ; serve in a glass dish. 

Bavarian Cream. — Whip one pint of cream to a stiff 
froth, laying it on a sieve ; boil a pint of rich milk, add 
one teaspoonful Metcalf's Water White- Vanilla and two 
tablespoonfuls sugar ; then take it off the fire and add 
half a box Swampscott Sparkling Gelatine, soaked for an 
hour in half a cupful water. Stir in whites of six eggs 



CREAMS, JELLIES, Al^D LIGHT DESSERTS, Xl\ 

well-beaten. When it has become quite cold and begins to 
thicken, stir it without ceasing a few minutes, until it is very 
smooth ; then stir in the whipped cream lightly until it is 
well mixed. Put it into a mold or molds, and set it on ice 
or in a cool place. 

Turret Cream. — Soak one box of gelatine in a cupful of 
milk four hours. Scald three cupfuls of milk; add one cup- 
ful of the sugar ; when this is dissolved, add the soaked 
gelatine. Stir over the fire until almost boiling hot ; strain 
and divide into two equal portions. Return one to the fire 
and heat quickly. When it nears the boiling-point, stir in 
the beaten yelks of three eggs. Let all cook together two 
m.inutes, and turn out into a bov/1 to cool. Wlien it has 
cooled, churn one pint of cream very stiff, and beat the 
whites of the eggs until they will stand alone. Divide the 
latter into two heaps. As the yellow gelatine begins to 
" form," whip one-half of the whites into it, a little at a time. 
To the white gelatine add the rest of the whites in the same 
manner, alternately with the whipped cream. Season the 
yeUow with vanilla, the Vv^hite with lemion juice beaten in at 
the last. Wet the inside of a tall, fluted mold with water, 
and arrange in the bottom, close to the outside of the mold, 
a row of crystallized cherries. Then put in a layer of the 
v/hite mixture; on this ciystallized apricots or peaches cut 
into strips ; a layer of the yellow, another border of cherries, 
and so on until your mold is full. When firm, which will be 
in a few hours if set on ice, wrap a cloth wrung out in hot 
water about the mold, and invert upon a flat dish. Eat with 
sweet cream, or, if you like, with brandied fruit. Not only 
is this a very palatable dish, but it is also very beautiful, well 
repaying the trouble of its preparation. 

Velvet Cream. — Half an ounce of isinglass dissolved in one 
and a half cupfuls oi white wine ; then add the juice and 
grated peel of a lemon, three-quarters of a pound of loaf 



172 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

sugar ; simmer all together until mixed well ; strain and 
add one and a half pints rich cream, and stir until cool ; 
pour into molds and let stand till stiff enough to turn out. 

Calf's Foot Jelly. — Take one pair of calf's feet and put 
them into a gallon of water ; let it boil half away and 
skim constantly ; strain it when cold ; take the fat from 
the top and bottom, then warm it ; add sugar, the juice 
of three lemons, a pint of Madeira wine, and the whites 
of seven eggs ; boil it half an hour, strain through a 
flannel bag, and cool in molds. 

Wine Jelly. — One box of Swampscott Sparkling Gela- 
tine dissolved in one pint of cold water, one pint of wine, 
one quart of boiling water, two cupfuls of granulated 
sugar, and three lemons. Cool in molds. 

Wine Jelly, No. 2. — Soak one package of Swampscott 
Sparkling Gelatine in a large cupful of cold water. Add 
to this all the juice and half the rind of a lemon, two 
cupfuls of white sugar, and a half teaspoonful of bitter 
almond or two peach leaves, and cover for half an hour ; 
then pour on boiling water, stir and strain. After add- 
ing two cupfuls of pale sherry or white wine, strain 
again through a flannel bag. Cool in molds. 

Jelly Oranges. — Soak a package of Swampscott Spark- 
ling Gelatine about fifteen minutes in a cup of cold 
water. Cut from the top of each of a dozen fine oranges 
a round piece, leaving a hole just large enough to admit 
the bowl of a small spoon. Clean out the pulp, so as 
not to tear the edges of the hole. Scrape the inner 
skin from the sides with your forefinger, and when 
the oranges are emptied lay them in cold water. 
Strain the juice of all and grated peel of three of the 
oranges through coarse, thin muslin over three cupfuls of 
sugar, squeezing rather hard to get the coloring matter. 



CREAMS, JELLIES, AND LIGH2 DESSERTS, 173 

Stir this until it is a thick sirup, and add a quarter teaspoon- 
ful of cinnamon. Pour two cupfuls of boiling water upon the 
soaked gelatine, and stir over the fire until well dissolved ; 
add the juice and sugar, stir all together, and strain through 
a flannel bag into a pitcher, not shaking or squeezing it, lest 
it should become cloudy. Wipe off the outside of the 
oranges, set them close together in a dish, the open ends 
uppermost, and fill very full with the warm jelly, as it will 
shrink in cooling. Set it away in a cold place where there 
is no dust Next day cut each in half with a sharp knife, 
taking care to sever the skin all around before cutting into 
the jelly. If neatly divided, the rich amber jelly will be a 
fair counterfeit of the orange pulp. Pile in a glass dish, 
with green leaves around, as you would the real fruit. This 
is a delicious dish, and it is highly ornamental on the table. 

Apple Jelly. — Soak half a package Swampscott Spark- 
ling Gelatine in one cupful cold water. Pare, core and 
slice a dozen well flavored pippins, throwing each piece 
into cold water as it is cut to preserve the color. Pack 
them in a glass or stoneware jar with just cold water 
enough to cover them ; cover the jar loosely, that the 
steam may escape ; set in a pot of warm water and bring 
to a boil. Cook until the apples are broken into pieces. 
Have ready in a bowl the soaked gelatine, tw^o cupfuls 
powdered sugar, the juice of two lemons, and the grated 
peel of one. Strain the apple pulp scalding hot over 
them ; stir until the gelatine is dissolved ; strain again 
through a flannel bag, without shaking or squeezing it ; 
wet a mold with cold water, fill it, and set in a cold place 
until firm. This preparation is greatly improved if 
formed in a mold wdth a cylinder in the centre, the cav- 
ity being filled and heaped with whipped cream. 

Coffee Jelly. — Take half a box of sparkling gelatine, 
three-quarters of a pound of sugar, pint of strong coffee ; 



174 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

pour the coffee over the gelatine, and when the gelatine 
is dissolved stir the sugar in, adding at the same time 
one-half pint of boiling water ; when thoroughly mixed, 
strain into molds and serve with whipped cream. 

Orange Jelly. — Soak one-half box of Swampscott 
Sparkling Gelatine in one-half cup cold water fifteen 
minutes ; add one cup boiling water, juice of one lemon, 
one cup sugar and one pint orange juice ; stir, strain 
and place in mold, and set on ice to harden. 

Lemon Jelly. — Soak one box of Swampscott Sparkling 

Gelatine in one pint of cold water fifteen minutes ; add 
three pints boiling water and stir until dissolved ; add 
the juice of three lemons and grated rind of one ; strain 
and sweeten to taste. 

Orange Trifle. — Stir half a package of soaked gelatine into 
a cupful of boiling water. Mix the juice of tv/o oranges 
and rind of one with a cupful of powdered sugar, and pour 
the hot liquid over them. Should the gelatine not dissolve 
readily, set all oyer the fire and stir until clear. Strain, and 
stir in the beaten yelks of three eggs. Heat quickly within 
a vessel of boiling water, stirring constantly lest the yelks 
curdle. If they do curdle, strain again through coarse flan- 
nel. Set aside until perfectly cold and slightly stiff, then 
whip in a pint of frothed cream. Wet a mold, fill, and set it 
on ice. 

Orange Dessert. — Pare five or six oranges ; cut into thin 
slices ; pour over them a coffeecupful of sugar. Boil one 
pint of milk ; add, while boiling, the yelks of three eggs, 
one tablespoonful of corn-starch (made smooth with a little 
cold milk) ; stir all the time ; as soon as thickened, pour 
over the fruit. Beat the whites of the eggs to a froth ; add 
two tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar ; pour over the cus- 
tard, and brown slightly in the oven. Serve cold.

Apple Snow. — Grate half a dozen apples to a pulp ; press 
them th'-ough a sieve ; add half a cupful of powdered sugar 
and a teaspoonful of extract of lemon ; take the whites of 
six eggs, whip them for several minutes, and sprinkle two 
tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar over them ; beat the 
apple pulp to a froth, and add the beaten ^%^ ; whip the 
mixture until it looks like stiff snow ; then pile it high in 
rough portions on a glass dish ; garnish with small spoonfuls 
of currant jelly. 

Floating Island. — Beat the yelks of six eggs until very 
light ; sweeten and flavor to taste ; stir into a quart of boil- 
ing milk ; cook till it thickens ; when cool, pour into a low 
glass dish ; whip the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth ; 
sweeten, and place over a dish of boiling water to cook. 
Take a tablespoon and drop on the whites of the cream, far 
enough apart so that the " little white islands " will not 
touch each other. By dropping little specks of bright 
jelly on each island a pleasing effect will be produced. 

Blanc-mange. — Take one quart of milk, one ounce gelatine, 
and sugar to sweeten to taste ; put it on the fire, and keep 
stirring until it is all melted, then pour it into a bowl and 
stir until cold; season with vanilla; pour it into a mold, 
and set in a cool place to stiffen. 

Tapioca Blanc-mange. — Take one pint of new milk, half a 
pound of the best farina-tapioca soaked in water four 
hours, three-fourths of a cupful of sugar, two teaspoonfuls of 
almond or vanilla extract, a little salt. Heat the milk, and 
stir the soaked tapioca. When it has dissolved, add the 
sugar. Boil slowly fifteen minutes, stirring all the time ; 
take from the fire, and beat until nearly cold. Flavor and 
pour into a mold dipped in cold water. Sago blanc-mange 
may be made in the same manner.

stoned, and halved ; sprinkle two tablespoonfuls of sugar 
over the fruit, pour the custard over gently, and bake in a 
quick oven twenty minutes ; draw it out, and cover with the 
well-beaten whites of the three eggs ; sprinkle a little fine 
sugar over the top, and set in the oven until brown. Eat 
warm with sauce, or cold with cream. 

Charlotte Russa — Dissolve half a box of gelatine in cold 
water. Beat the yelks of four eggs vv^ith two cupfuls of

Figs a la Genevieve. — Dissolve two ounces of best sugar 
in half a pint of cold water in an enameled stewpan, with 
half the very thin rind of a large lemon ; when this is done, 
put into it half a pound of Turkey figs, and put the stew- 
pan over a moderate fire, so that the figs may stew very 
slowly; when quite soft, add one glassful of common port 
or any other v/ine, and the strained juice of half a lemon ; 
serve them cold for dessert. About two hours or two hours 
and a half is the average time for stewing the figs, and the 
flavor may be varied by using orange peel and juice in- 
stead of lemon, and by boiling two or three bitter almonds 
in the sirup. 

Biscuit Glace. — Make a quart of rich boiled custard, flavor 
it with vanilla, and let it cool. Then mix with it a quart of 
grated pineapple or mashed peaches. Stir them well to- 
gether, and add enough sugar to allow for the loss in freez- 
ing. Freeze in the usual way, stirring in a pint of cream, 
whipped, when it is beginning to set in the freezer. Partly 
fill little paper cases with the mixture, and smooth the tops 
nicely. Place them carefully in the cleaned and dried freezer, 
Knd let them remain embedded in ice for several hours.

XIII.— CAKES AND CAKE-BAKING. 

BEST MATERIALS REQUISITE FOR CAKE-MAKING ; WHAT THEY 
SHOULD be; WEIGHING AND MEASURING INGREDIENTS; HOW 
TO MIX cake; FRUITS AND FLAVORS FOR CAKE; HOW TO BAKE 
CAKE ; HOW TO TEST IT ; HOW TO KEEP IT ; HOV/ TO ICE IT. 
NINETY-NINE RECIPES FOR CAKES. 

IN cake-making it is absolutely essential that the best 
materials be employed. Stale eggs, strong butter, musty 
flour, or common sugar are not so much as to be 
thought of in this connection. The idea that such refuse 
" will do for cooking " is most unworthy. When a luxury, 
such as cake, is attempted, the maker should certainly be 
willing to luxuriate in acceptable ingredients. 

Flour for cake should be white and dry. It should always 
be carefully sifted. Sugar should be white, diy, and free 
from lumps. Eggs and butter should be sweet and fresh ; 
the milk rich and pure. Fruit and extracts must be of the 
best. The weighing and measuring of ingredients must be 
accurately done. Guessing at quantities has spoiled many 
a cake. 

For mixing cake, an earthen or wooden dish and a 
■wooden spoon are requisite. Butter and sugar should be 
beaten together to a cream before using. Butter may be 
softened for this purpose, if too hard to manage readily, but 
it must not be melted. Whites and yelks of eggs must be 
beaten separately, until there is no stringiness visible, and 
the froth can be taken up on a spoon. Beat eggs in a broad, 
shallow dish, and in a cool place. It is well to lay the eggs 
in cold water for an hour before beating them, as they will 
beat the lighter for such treatment. Sweet milk is best for 

179 



180 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

solid cake; sour tniik, for light cake. The two should never 
be mixed. 

Baking-powder should be mixed dry through the flour. 
Soda and cream of tartar should be dissolved in milk. 
Flavoring extracts, fruit, and spices must be added the last 
thing, and fruit should always be well sprinkled with flour 
before it is put in the dough. Currants and such fruit 
should be washed, picked over, and dried before using. 
Almonds should be blanched by pouring boiling water over 
them till they pop from their skins. Cake should be beaten 
as little as possible after the flour has been added. When 
it requires long baking, the bottom and sides of the pan 
should be lined with paper v/ell buttered. This will insure 
the easy turning out of the cake when done. 

Much of the success in cake-baking depends on the heat- 
ing of the oven. If the oven is very hot when the cake 
goes in, it will bake on top before it becomes light. If the 
oven is too cool, it will rise and fall again before done. If 
the top of the cake browns too fast, cover it with thick 
paper. Try it by inserting a broom-splinter or knitting- 
needle in the thickest part of the cake, and if nothing ad- 
heres when it is drawn out, it is done. Turn out of the tins 
at once, taking care not to expose the cake to draft. 

Cake should be kept in earthen pans or crocks, or tin 
boxes, but never in wooden boxes or drawers. It will keep 
better for being wrapped in a cloth, and more than is needed 
should not be cut. 

Cake that is to be frosted should be baked in pans with 
perpendicular sides. The icing should be put on as soon 
as the cake is removed from the oven. This will insure its 
drying smooth and hard.

cake with one cupful of milk, and one teaspoonful of corn- 
starch dissolved in it, and brought to a boiling heat, with the 
yelk of one ^^^ dropped in to color it. Flavor with lemon 
or vanilla ; let it cool. Bake your cake in round pie-tins ; 
use just enough batter in the tin so that when they are 
baked two of them put together will make one proper 
sized cake. Make the custard first, and let it cool ; put the

196 THE HO USE fVIFE'S LIBRAE V. 

eggs, two small cupfuls of fine sugar. Heat the milk, stir in 
the sugar and corn-starch, boil five minutes, and put in the 
eggs. Stir steadily until it becomes quite thick. Divide 
this custard into two parts. Stir into one two tablespoonfuls 
of grated chocolate and a teaspoonful of vanilla ; into the 
other, bitter almond. 

Prepare another filling thus : Whites of three eggs, 
whisked stiff, one heaping cup of powdered sugar, juice and 
half the grated peel of one lemon. Whip all together well. 
Lay the brown cake as the foundation of the pile ; spread 
with the yellow custard; add the pink, coated with choco- 
late ; then add the white and yellow with the frosting be- 
tween them. Vary the order as fancy dictates. Cover the 
top with, powdered sugar or with icing. 

Angel's Food. — Use the whites of eleven eggs, a scant pint 
of granulated sugar, a large half pint of flour, one teaspoonful 
of cream tartar (even full), and a teaspoonful of vanilla. Sift 
the flour four times, then measure ; add cream of tartar, and 
then sift again. Sift the sugar four times, then measure it. 
Beat the eggs to a stiff froth on a large dish, and on same 
dish add the sugar quickly and lightly ; add the flour in the 
same way, and last of all the vanilla. Put at once into a 
moderate oven, and bake forty minutes or more. Do not 
grease the pans. Turn upside down to cool, putting small 
blocks of wood under the edges that air may reach the cake. 

Macaroons. — Blanch half a pound of almonds with boiling 
water, and pound them to a smooth paste. Add a table- 
spoonful of essence of lemon, half a pound of powdered 
sugar, and the whites of two eggs. Work the paste well to- 
gether with the back of a spoon. Wet your hands, and roll 
them in balls the size of a nutmeg, and lay them an inch 
apart on a sheet of paper. Wet your finger, and press gently 
over the surface to make them shiny. Bake three-quarters 
of an hour in a very moderate oven. 



CAKES AXD CAKE-BAKING. 197 

Chocolate Macaroons. — Put three ounces of plain Bens- 
dorp*s Chocolate in a pan, and melt on a slow fire ; then 
work it to a thick paste with one pound of powdered 
sugar and the whites of three eggs ; roll the mixture 
down to the thickness of about one-quarter of an inch ; 
cut it in small, round pieces with a paste-cutter, either 
plain or scalloped ; butter a pan slightly, and dust it with 
flour and sugar in equal quantities ; place in it the pieces 
of paste or mixture, and bake in a hot but not quick oven. 

Cream Puffs. — Stir one-half pounjd.of butter into a pint of 
warm water, set it on the fire in a saucepan, and slowly 
bring it to a boil, stirring often. When it boils, put in three- 
quarters of a pound of flour, and let it boil one minute, stir- 
ring constantly. Take from the fire, and turn into a deep 
dish to cool. Beat eight eggs light, and whip into this cool 
paste, first the yelks, then the whites. Drop in great spoon- 
fuls on buttered paper so as not to touch or run into each 
other, and bake ten minutes. Split them, and fill with the 
following cream : One quart of milk, four tablespoonfuls of 
corn-starch, two eggs, two cupfuls of sugar. Stir while boil- 
ing, and when thick, add a teaspoonful of butter. When 
cold, flavor. 

Kisses. — Beat the whites of four eggs very stiff, add one- 
half pound of pulverized sugar, and flavor to taste. Beat 
until very light, then lay in heaps the size of an ^^% on 
paper. Place the paper on a piece of wood half an inch 
thick, and put in a hot oven. Make the surface shiny by 
passing over it a wet knife. Bake until they look yellowish, 
when they are done. 

Chocolate Kisses. — Beat stiff whites of two eggs ; beat in 
gradually one-half pound powdered sugar. Scrape fine 
one and a half ounces Bensdorp's Chocolate ; dredge with 
flour, mix the flour well ; add gradually to the eggs and 
sugar ; stirring very hard. Cover bottom of a pan with 



198 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

white paper, and place on it spots of powdered sugar the 
size of half-dollars. Heap the mixture on these spots, 
smooth with a broad knife, sift with powdered sugar, and 
bake quickly. 

Cocoanut Steeples. — One pound of powdered sugar ; one- 
half pound of grated cocoanut ; whites of five eggs. Whip 
the eggs as for icing, adding the sugar as you go on urtil it 
will stand alone, then beat in the cocoanut. Mold the mix- 
ture with your hands into small cones, and set these far 
enough apart not to touch one another upon buttered paper 
in a baking-pan. Bake in a very moderate oven. 

Meringues. — Mix the whites of four eggs, beaten to a stifif 
froth, with one pound of pulverized sugar, and flavored to 
tlie taste. Beat stiff, bake the same as macaroons, when 
light brown, slip them from the papers, and put the smooth 
sides together, with jelly between. 

Lady-fingers. — One-half pound pulverized sugar and six 
yelks of eggs, well stirred ; add one-fourth pound flour, 
whites of six eggs, well beaten. Bake ik iady-finger tins, 
or squeeze through a bag of paper in strips two or three 
inches long. 

Lady-fingers, No. 2. — Rub half a pound of butter into a 
pound of flour ; to this add half a pound of sugar, the juice 
and grated rind of one large lemon, and, lastly, three eggs, 
the whites and yelks beaten separately, and the whites stirred 
in after all the other ingredients are well mixed together. 
This dough, if properly made, will be stiff enough to make 
rolls about the size of a lady's finger ; it will spread when 
in the oven, so that it will be of the right size and shape. 
If you wish them to be especially inviting, dip them in cho- 
colate icing after they are baked, and put two together. 
See that the icing is so hard that it will not run, and set the 
cakes on a platter in a cool room until the icing is firm. 



CAKES AND CAKE-BAKING. 199 

Eclairs a la Creme. — Three-fourths pound flour, one pint 
water, ten eggs, one-half cupful butter. Put the water on 
the fire in a stewpan with the butter ; as soon as it boils 
stir in the sifted flour ; stir well until it leaves the bottom 
and sides of the pan, when taken from the fire ; then add 
the eggs, one at a time. Put the batter in a bag of paper, 
and press out in the shape of fingers on a greased tin. 
When cold, fill with cream, prepared as follows : One and 
one-half pints of milk, two cupfuls sugar, yelks of five ^g'g?>, 
one tablespoonful butter, three large tablespoonfuls corn- 
starch, two teaspoonfuls extract vanilla. Frosted with choco- 
late, they are much improved in appearance and flavor. 

Icing for Cakes. — In making icing, use at least a quarter of 
a pound of pulverized sugar to the white of each ^gg ; if 
not stiff enough, add more sugar. Break the whites into a 
broad, cool dish, and throw in a small handful of sugar. 
Begin whipping it in with long, even strokes of the beater, 
adding the sugar gradually. Beat until the icmg is smooth 
and firm, then add the flavoring. Spread it on the cake 
with a broad-bladed knife, dipped in cold water. If orna- 
mentation of the icing is desired, it may be done by affixing 
prepared leaves, flowers, etc., which can be had at the con- 
fectioners' stores or at their supply stores. To make letters, 
tracery, etc., for cakes, roll into a funnel shape a piece of 
thick, white paper; fill this with icing in the soft state, 
allowing it to drip out slowly from the small end of the 
paper cone. Apply this carefully, and allow it to harden. 

Orange Icing. — Whites of two eggs, one-half pound of 
pulverized sugar, and the juice of a large orange, treated 
as above. 

Lemon Icing. — Whites of two eggs, one-half pound of 
pulverized sugar, juice and part of the rind of one lemon. 

Chocolate Icing. — Whites of two eggs, one-half pound of 



200 ^///^ HOUSElVIFE\y LIBRARY. 

pulverized sugar, and three tablespoonfuls of grated 
Bensdorp's Chocolate. 

Almond Icing. — The whites of three eggs, one cupful of 
pounded blanched almonds, three-quarters of a pound of 
pulverized sugar, and a little almond extract. 

Banana Icing. — Whites of two eggs, one-half pound of pul- 
verized sugar, and one banana finely crushed through it. 
This cake should be eaten the same day it is made, as the 
banana discolors over night. 

Cocoanut Frosting. — Whites of two eggs, one-half pound 
of pulverized sugar. Spread on the cake, then sprinkle 
thickly with grated cocoanut. This will make a whiter frost- 
ing than results from stirring in the cocoanut. 

Cooked Frosting. — One cupful of granulated sugar, wet 
with a little water. Let it boil without stirring until it be- 
gins to thicken. Beat the whites of two eggs very light. 
Strain the boiled sugar into them slowly, beating all the 
time. Flavor to taste.

XIV.— FRESH FRUITS AND NUTS. 

rALUE OF FRESH FRUITS ON THE TABLE; ABUNDANCE OF FRUITS; 
NUTRITIVE VALUE OF FRUITS; WHERE TO GATHER AND HOW 
TO STORE FRUITS. TWENTY-TWO RECIPES FOR SERVING FRESH 
FRUITS AND NUTS. 

FRESH fruits are a most deli^-htful accessory to the 
table supply of both rich and poor. They are so great 
in variety, so rich in flavor, so beautiful in appearance, 
so healthful, and of so long continuance in most parts of the 
country, that it behooves every housekeeper to familiarize 
herself with the best methods of using fresh fruits to 
advantage. 

A few years ago each locality depended upon its own 
local crop of fruits. Now the railroads bring early fruits 
from the far South and late fruits from the far North, so 
that at the centres of population the several fruit seasons are 
delightfully prolonged. Nor are we restricted to our own 
country's production. Such are the facilities for rapid and 
safe communication from distant points, that the world lays 
her tribute of fruits, sweet and sound, at the door of the 
enlightened nations. 

Fruits do not take an important place as nutrients. They 
belong rather among the luxuries, and yet, as an agreeable 
stimulant to digestion, they occupy a front rank. In many 
conditions of health, some of the fruits are the only articles 
the invalid can enjoy, and their genial influences contribute 
greatly to the general improvement of a patient's appetite. 

Fruits intended for immediate use should be gathered 
early in the morning, while the coolness of the niglit dews 

201 



202 ^-^^ ^O ^^^ WIFE'S LIBRAE K 

is upon them. They should be just ripe, neither overdone 
nor underdone, in nature's great process of preparing them 
for human food. Fruit for storage is best gathered at the 
middle of a dry day. It should be nearly ripe. If unripe, 
or overripe it will not keep well. A moist atmosphere, but 
not one positively damp, is best for the storing of fruit. An 
ordinary cellar does better than a dry storeroom. Fruit 
keeps better in the dark than in the light. 

All varieties of nuts belong to the albuminous fruits and 
are very nutritious, though the richer nuts are not easy 
of digestion owing to their oily properties. 

The supply of peanuts once came wholly from Africa, but 
our Southern States have so successfully cultivated this 
popular nut that we are now independent. The bulk of the 
supply is from Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee. 
During a single season the crop of Virginia rose to one 
million one hundred thousand bushels, of Tennessee, five 
hundred and fifty thousand bushels, and of North Carolina, 
one hundred and twenty thousand bushels. 

The Texas pecan is especially in demand. While a few 
years ago several barrels of pecans abundantly supplied the 
demand, carloads and invoices of one or two hundred bar- 
rels are not now uncommon. 

In the Eastern States hickory nuts are sufficiently plenti- 
ful to ship to New York half a dozen carloads a weekv/hen 
demanded. 

The chestnut is becoming scarcer every year, but their 
great popularity will probably prevent their total disappear- 
ance, as they are already being successfully cultivated, and 
it is expected that in a few years the cultivated put will equal 
in quality the high-priced Italian chestnuts. 

RECIPES. 

Watermelons. — Wipe watermelons clean when they are 
taken from the ice. They should lie on ice for at least four 



FRESH FRUITS AND NUTS. 203 

hours before they are eaten. Cut off a slice at each end of 
the watermelon, then cut through the centre ; stand on end 
on platter, and slice down, allowing each slice a part of the 
centre, or heart. 

Nutmegs, etc. — Wash nutmegs and muskmelons ; wipe 
dr\' ; cut in two ; shake out the seeds lightly, and put a 
lump of ice in each half Eat with pepper and salt. A sil- 
ver spoon is a neat and pleasant article with which to eat 
small, ripe melons. 

Pineapples. — Slice on a slaw-cutter, or very thin with a 
knife ; mix with finely powdered sugar. Set on ice till ready 
to serve. 

Oranges are nice served whole, the skins quartered and 
turned down. Form in a pyramid with bananas and white 
grapes. 

Orange and Cocoanut. — A layer of oranges sliced, then 
sugar, then a layer of cocoanut, grated ; then another of 
oranges, and so on until the dish is full. This is by many 
known as Ambrosia. 

Sliced Peaches. — Peel and slice ripe peaches. Lay them in 
a dish with plenty of sugar fjr an hour or two, till tea time. 
Eat with cream. 

Stewed Peaches. — Make a sirup of sugar and water ; halve 
the peaches, leaving the stone in one half, and drop into 
sirup. Allow the whole to simmer slowly until fruit is ten- 
der; then remove fruit, and let sirup boil till thick; then pour 
over fruit and serve at once. 

Frosted Peaches. — Put half a cupful of water and the 
beaten whites of three eggs together ; dip in each peach, 
using fine, large freestones, after you have rubbed off 
the fur with a clean cloth ; and then roll in powdered sugar. 
Set them on the stem end, upon a sheet of white paper, in 
a sunny window. When half dry, roll again in the sugar. 



204 THE HO USE WIFE' S L IBRAR >. 

Expose to the sun and breeze until perfectly dry. Until 
ready to arrange them in the glass dish for table, keep in 
a cool, dry place. Decorate with green leaves. 

Fried Peaches. — Cut the peaches in two, and remove the 
stones. Dust a little flour on the side from which the stone 
is taken, and fry, only on that side, in a little butter. When 
done, add sugar and a little butter. 

Baked Apples. — Pare and core good, sound, tart apples. 
Fill them with sugar, butter, and a flavor of spice. Put a 
little water in the pan, and bake until the apples are 
thoroughly tender. 

Apple Sauce. — Pare, core, and slice nice, juicy apples that 
are not very sweet ; put them in a stewpan with a little 
grated lemon peel, and water enough to keep them from 
burning. Stew till soft and tender ; mash to a paste, and 
sweeten well with brown sugar, adding a little butter and 
nutmeg. 

Apples witli Lemon. — Make a sirup of sugar and water. 
Slice a lemon into it, and let boil until clear. Pare and core 
sound, tart apples, cut into quarters, and lay them carefully 
into the sirup ; let them cook gently until a straw can be 
run through them, taking care not to break them. Lay the 
pieces of apple in a glass dish, boil down the sirup, and 
when slightly cool, pour over the apples. 

Apple Moat. — Pare, slice, and stew six large apples in as 
much water as will cover them ; when well done, press them 
through a sieve and sweeten highly with crushed sugar ; 
while cooling, beat the whites of four eggs to a stiff froth, 
and stir into the apples ; flavor with lemon or vanilla ; serve 
with plenty of sweet cream. 

Transparent Apple. — Boil tart, ripe, and juicy apples in a 
little water; then strain through a fine cloth, and add a 
pound of white sugar to a pint of juice. Boil till it jellies, 



FRESH FRUITS AIVD NUTS. 205 

and then put into molds. It is very nice served with blanc- 
mange in saucers. 

Baked Pears. — Place in a stone jar, first a layer of pears, 
with their skins on, then a layer of sugar, then pears, and so 
on until the jar is full. Then put in as much water as it 
will hold. Bake three hours. 

Quinces. — Bake ripe quinces thoroughly ; when cold, strip 
off the skins, place the quinces in a glass dish, and sprinkle 
them with white sugar ; serve with rich cream. 

Bananas and Cream. — Peel, slice, and heap up in a glass 
dessert-dish, and serve raw, with fine sugar and cream. 

Fried Bananas. — Cut the bananas into slices, and fr>' in a 
little butter. This makes a very rich dish. 

Stewed Rhubarb. — Carefully remove the outer stringy 
skin ; then cut in pieces an inch long, and simmer gently till 
tender in water and sugar, and the rind and juice of a lemon. 
When done add a bit of butter and nutmeg. 

Crystallized Fruit. — Pick out the finest of any kind of fruit j 
leave in the stones ; beat the whites of three eggs to a stiff 
froth ; lay the fruit in the beaten Qg^, with the stems 
upward ; drain them, and beat the part that drips off again ; 
select them out, one by one, and dip them into finely pow- 
dered sugar ; cover a pan with a sheet of fine paper, place 
the fruit on it, and set it in a cool place ; when the icing on 
the fruit becomes firm, pile them on a dish, and set them in 
a cold place. 

Candied Fruits. — Make a very rich sirup with one pound 
of granulated sugar to a gill of water. Heat over boiling 
water till the sugar is dissolved. Pare and halve fine, ripe, 
but solid peaches. Put a single layer of them in the sirup, 
in a shallow vessel ; cook slowly until clear ; drain from the 
sirup, and put to dry in a moderately heated oven. When 
fairly dry they may be eaten at once; or, after drying 



200 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

twenty-four hours, they may be packed for future use. 
Plums, cherries, and pears may be candied in the same 
manner. 

Nuts. — Almonds are inseparably joined with raisins in 
table service ; so for evening uses, hickory nuts and apples 
form a pleasant combination. All the harder-shelled nuts 
should be well cracked before they are served. With the 
softer-shelled, nut crackers should be furnished. Nut picks 
should always be at hand. 

Sweet almonds, which are used for dessert, are of several 
varieties. Those known as the Syrian, or Jordan almonds, 
are regarded as the best. Those with hard shells are gen- 
erally richer in flavor than those with the soft. Certainly 
the harder shell offers the more effective protection. The 
skin of almonds is not easily digested. For use in cooking 
they should be blanched, but for table use this is not desir- 
able. Walnuts keep well and improve with age. Of the 
hickory-nut family, the shdl-bark is considered best. These, 
too, are the better for age.

To insure success in preserving fruits, the first thing to 
be looked after is the fruit itself This should be fully 
ripe, fresh, sound, and scrupulously clean and dry. It 
should be gathered in the morning of a sunny day, as it will 
then possess its finest flavor. Care should be taken to re- 
move all bruised or decayed parts. Allowing them to re- 
main will darken the sirup, and consequently impair the 
beauty of the preserves. Fruit requiring to be pared should 
be laid in water to preserve the color after the paring. The 
best sugar is the cheapest ; indeed, there is no economy in 
stinting the sugar, either as to quality or proper quantity, 
for inferior sugar is wasted in scum, and the preserves will 
not keep unless a sufficient proportion of sugar is boiled 
with the fruit. At the same time, too large a proportion of 
sugar will destroy the natural flavor of the fruit, and in all 
probability make fruit candy, instead of the result sought. 

The usual proportion in making preserves, is a pound of 
sugar to a pound of fruit. There are a few fruits which 
require more sugar. In making the sirup, use a small cup- 
ful of water to a pound of fruit. The sirup should always 
be boiled and strained before putting the fruit in. 

Fruit should be cooked in brass kettles, or those of bell- 
metal. Modern kettles lined with porcelain, are much used 

207 



208 THE HO USE WIFE' S LIBRAR K 

for this purpose. The kettle should be broad and shallow, 
so that there will be no necessity for heaping the fruit. 
Never use tin, iron, or pewter spoons, or skimmers, for pre- 
serves, as they will convert the color of red fruit into a 
dingy purple, and impart, besides, a very unpleasant flavor. 

Great care should be taken not to place the kettle flat 
upon the fire, as this will be likely to burn at the bottom. 

Glass jars are much the best for preserves, as the condi- 
tion of the fruit can be observed more readily. Whatever 
jars are used, however, the contents should be examined 
every three weeks for the first two months, and if there are 
any signs of either mold or fermentation it should be boiled 
over again. Presei-ves should be stored in a cool, dry place, 
but not in one into which fresh air never enters. Damp has 
a tendency to make the fruit mold, and heat to make it 
ferment. 

A jelly-bag should be in every kitchen. It should be 
made of flannel, pointed at the bottom, so that the jelly will 
run out chiefly at one point. It is a good plan to sew a 
strong loop to the top of the bag, so that it may be hung 
upon a nail near the fire, that the juice of the fruit may run 
through gradually into a vessel below. The bag should not 
be squeezed with the hands, if you wish a very clear jelly. 
After the clear juice has been obtained, the remainder may 
be pressed, to make a veiy excellent, but inferior article of 
jelly or marmalade. 

Rinse the tumblers or bowls to be used in cold water 
just before filling with jelly or marmalade. When the jelly 
is cold, fit a circle of tissue-paper, dip it in brandy, and 
place it directly on the surface of the fruit. This simple 
precaution will save the housekeeper much annoyance by 
protecting the conserve from mold. Should the fungus form 
inside the upper cover of the glass, the inner will effectually 
shield the contents. Paste thick paper over the top of the 
glass to exclude the air.

RECIPES. 

Cfiirrant Jelly. — Never gather currants or other soft or 
small seed fruit immediately after a rain for preserving pur- 
poses, as they are greatly impoverished by the moisture 
absorbed. In this climate, the first week in July is usually 
considered the time to make currant jelly. Weigh the cur- 
rants without removing the stems ; do not wash them, but 
remove leaves and whatever may adhere to them ; to each 
pound of fruit allow half the weight of granulated or pure 
loaf sugar ; put a few currants into a porcelain-lined kettle, 
and press them with a potato-masher, or anything conven- 
ient, in order to secure sufficient liquid to prevent burning ; 
then add the remainder of the fruit and boil freely for twenty 
minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent burning ; take out 
and strain through a jelly-bag, putting the liquid into earthen 
or wooden vessels. When strained, return the liquid to the 
kettle, without the trouble of measuring, and let it boil 
thoroughly for a moment or so ; then add the sugar ; the 
moment the sugar is entirely dissolved, the jelly is done, 
and must be dished, or placed in glasses ; it will jelly upon 
the side of the cup as it is taken up, leaving no doubt as to 
the result. 

Currailt JeUy, No. 2. — Take three quarts of fine, ripe, red 
currants, and four of white ; put them into a jar, tie paper 
over the top, and put them into a cool oven for three or four 
hours, or else into a pan of boiling water, or set them on 
the side of the range ; when they are thoroughly heated, 
strain through a jelly -bag. To every pint of juice, add one 
pound of granulated sugar, and boil from five to fifteen 
minutes ; turn while hot into wet tumblers. 

Currant Jelly without Cooking. — Press the juice from the 
currants and strain it ; to every pint put a pound of fine white 
sugar ; mix them together until the sugar is dissolved ; then 
14 



210 THE HO USE WIFE'S LIBRAE V. 

put it in jars ; seal them and expose them to a hot sun for 
two or three days. 

Black Currant Jelly. — Boil the currants till the juice flows, 
then strain through a jelly-bag, and set it over the fire for 
twenty minutes, after which add half a pound of sugar to a 
pound of juice, and boil for about ten minutes. 

WMte Currant Jelly. — Strip the fruit off the stems, and 
pound it in a clean wooden bowl. Drip the juice gently 
through a jelly-bag. Prepare a very pure, clear sirup of the 
best white sugar; allow a pint of juice to a pound of sugar; 
boil it ten minutes only. Put it in glass preserve-tumblers, 
cover with paper to fit exactly, and keep it dry and cool. 

Apple JeUy. — Take twenty large, juicy apples; pare and 
chop ; put into a jar with the rind of four large lemons, 
pared thin and cut in bits ; cover the jar closely, and set in 
a pot of boiling water ; keep water boiling all around it until 
the apples are dissolved ; strain through a jelly-bag, and 
mix with the liquid the juice of four lemons ; to one pint of 
mixed juice use one pound of sugar; put in kettle, and when 
the sugar is melted set it on the fire, and boil and skim 
about twenty minutes, or until it is a thick, fine jelly. 

Apple Jelly, No. 2. — Peel and core sour apples ; boil them 
in a very little water, and strain them through a jelly-bag. 
Measure, and allow a pound of granulated sugar to a pint 
of juice. Mix the sugar and juice well together, and let it 
boil from five to ten minutes. Put it warm into glasses ; 
cut some white paper to fit the top, dip it in brandy, and lay 
on when the jelly is cool ; paste or tie thick paper over the 
glasses, and when cold put away in a dark, dry place. 

Crab-apple Jelly. — Wash and quarter Siberian crab-apples. 
Cover with cold water and let cook until thoroughly tender. 
Strain through a jelly-bag, and to every pint of juice add 
one pound of sugar. Let cook until it will jelly A slight 
flavoring of essence of cinnamon is an improvement. 



JELLIES, JAMS, AND PRESERVES. 211 

Quince Jelly. — Take very ripe quinces ; peel and core, and 
boil in a little water till very soft ; drain off the juice 
through a coarse towel, add an equal measure of sugar, and 
boil twenty minutes. 

Grape JeUy. — Mash the grapes thoroughly and strain 
out the juice. Add an equal measure of sugar, and boil 
twenty minutes. 

Barberry Jelly. — Pick the berries from the stalks, mash 
them, and boil fifteen minutes. Squeeze through a jelly- 
bag; allow a pound of white sugar to a pound of juice; 
melt the sugar in the juice, and boil half an hour. 

Raspberry JeUy. — Crush the raspberries and strain through 
a wet cloth. Add an equal measure of sugar, and boil from 
ten to twenty minutes. 

Apple Marmalade. — Pare, core, and slice two or three dozen 
tart, juicy apples ; three-quarters of a pound of sugar to 
every pint of juice. Stew until tender in just enough cold 
water to cover them. Drain off the juice through a colan- 
der, and put into a preserving-kettle, stirring into it three- 
quarters of a pound of sugar for every pini* of the liquid. 
Boil until it begins to jelly; strain the juice of two lemons 
into it ; put in the apples, and stew pretty fast, stirring 
almost constantly, until it becomes thick and smooth. If 
the apples are not entirely soft, rub them through the coL 
ander before adding them to the boiling sirup. 

Quince Marmalade. — Take very ripe quinces ; wash, pare 
and core them ; to each pound of fruit allow one pound of 
loaf sugar. Boil the parings and cores together, with water 
enough to cover them, till quite soft ; strain the liquid into 
the preserving-kettle with the fruit and sugar. Boil the 
whole over a slow fire, stirring frequently until the mass be- 
comes thick. 

Pear and Quince Marmalade. — Pare and core two dozen 
juicy pears and ten fine, ripe quinces. Add three-quarters 



212 THE HOUSEWIFE' S LIBRARY. 

of a pound of sugar to every pound of fruit and the juice of 
three lemons. Throw them into cold water, and stew the 
parings and cores in a little water to make the sirup. When 
they have boiled to pieces, strain off the liquid ; when cold, 
put in the sliced fruit and bring to a fast boil. When the 
mass is thick and smooth, cook steadily for an hour or more, 
working with a wooden spoon to a rich jelly. 

Pineapple Marmalade. — Take ripe, juicy pineapples; pare, 
cut out the specks very carefully, and grate on a coarse 
grater all but the core. Weigh, and allow a pound of sugar 
to a pound of fruit. Cook from twenty minutes to half an 
hour. 

Orange Marmalade. — Take eighteen sweet, ripe oranges, six 
pounds best white sugar. Grate the peel from four of these 
and reserve it for the marmalade. The rinds of the others 
will not be needed. Pare the fruit carefully, removing the 
inner white skin as well as the yellow. Slice the orange ; 
remove the seeds ; put the fruit and grated peel in a porce- 
lain kettle, and boil steadily until the pulp is reduced to a 
smooth mass. Take from the fire, and put through a col- 
ander. Stir in six pounds of the best- white sugar; return 
to the fire, and boil fast, stirring constantly half an hour or 
until thick. 

Grape Marmalade. — Put green grapes into a preserving-pan 
with sufficient water to cover them. Put them on the fire, 
and boil until reduced to a mash ; put the pulp through a 
sieve which will strain out the seeds; to each pound of pulp 
add tv/o pounds of the best loaf sugar, and boil to the con- 
sistence of a jelly. 

Peach Marmalade. — Select peaches which are quite ripe ; 
pare and cut them in small pieces ; to every pound of fruit 
add one pound of sugar ; put the fruit and sugar into a pre- 
serving-kettle, and mash well together ; place it over the fire, 
and when it begins to boil, stir until it becomes quite thick. 



JELLIES, JAMS, AND PRESERVES. 213 

Cherry Jam. — First stone and then weigh some freshly 
gathered preserving cherries; boil them over a brisk fire 
for an hour, keeping them almost constantly stirred from the 
Lottom of the pan, to which they will otherwise be liable to 
stick and burn. Add for each pound of the fruit half a 
pound of good sugar roughly powdered, and boil quickly 
for twenty minutes, taking off the scum as it rises. 

Blackberry Jam. — To four bowls of blackberries add four 
bowls of sugar; boil until it jellies. 

Raspberry Jam. — Mash the raspberries, and allow a pound 
of sugar to a pound of fruit. Boil twenty minutes. A few 
currants added to raspberry jam is considered by many a 
great improvement. 

Barberry Jam. — The barberries should be quite ripe, though 
they should not be allowed to hang until they begin to 
decay. Strip them from the stalks, throw aside such as are 
spotted, and for each pound of fruit allow eighteen ounces of 
well-refined sugar ; boil this, with one pint of water to every 
four pounds, until it becomes white and falls in thick 
masses from the spoon ; tlien throw in the fruit, and keep it 
stirred over a brisk fire for six minutes only ; take off the 
scum, and pour it into jars or glasses. 

Strawberry Jam. — Use fine, scarlet berries ; weigh and boil 
them for thirty-five minutes, keeping them constantly 
stirred ; add eight ounces of good sugar to the pound of 
fruit ; mix them well off the fire, then boil again quickly for 
twenty-five minutes. One pound of white currant juice 
added at the outset to four of the strawberries will greatly 
improve this preserve. 

White Currant Jam. — Boil together quickly for seven min* 
utes equal quantities of fine white currants, picked very care- 
fully, and of the best white sugar pounded and passed 
through a sieve. Stir the presei-ve gently the whole time, 



2lf THE HOUSEWIFE' S LIBRARY. 

aiid skim it thoroughly. Just before it is taken from the 
fire, throw in the strained juice of one good lemon to four 
pounds of the fruit. 

Damson Jam. — The fruit for this jam should be freshly- 
gathered and quite ripe. Split, stone, weigh, and boil it 
quickly for forty minutes ; then stir in half its weight of 
good sugar roughly powdered, and when it is dissolved, 
give the preserve fifteen minutes additional boiling, keeping 
it stirred and thoroughly skimmed. 

Green Grage Jam. — Rub ripe green gages through a sieve ; put 
all the pulp into a pan with an equ^.l weight of loaf sugar 
pounded and sifted. Boil the whole until sufficiently thick, 
and put into glasses. 

Preserved Peaches. — Weigh the peaches, and allow three- 
quarters of a pound of sugar to every pound of fruit. Throw 
about half the sugar over the fruit, and let it stand over 
night. In the morning drain the sirup off the fruit, add the 
rest of the sugar, and let that come to a boil. Put the 
peaches in, and let them boil until you can stick a straw 
through them. In cooking the peaches, put a few at a time 
only in the sirup to cook. 

Preserved Peaches, No. 2. — Weigh the fruit after it is pared 
and the stones extracted and allow a pound of sugar to every 
pound of peaches. Put the sugar in a preserving-kettle, and 
make the sirup; let it just boil ; lay the peaches in, and let 
them boil steadily until they are tender and clear. Take 
them out with a perforated skimmer and lay upon flat 
dishes, crowding as little as possible. Boil the sirup almost 
to a jelly, until it is clear and thick, skimming off all the 
scum. Fill the jars two-thirds full of the peaches, pour on 
the boiling sirup, and, when cold, cover with brandied 
tissue-paper, then with thick paper tied tightly over them. 
Or put them in air-tight jars. 



JELLIES, JAMS, AND PRESERVES. 215 

Preserved Quinces. — Use a pound of sugar to each pound 
of quince after paring, coring, and quartering ; take half of 
the sugar and make a thin sirup ; stew in this a few of the 
quinces at a time till all are finished. Make a rich sirup of 
the remaining sugar, and pour over them. 

Pineapple Preserves. — Use pineapples as ripe as can be had. 
Pare and cut them into thin slices, weigh them, and allow 
one pound of the best granulated sugar to each pound of 
fruit. Take a deep china bowl or dish, and in it put a layer 
of fruit and sugar alternately, a coating of sugar on the top; 
let it stand all night. In the morning, take out the fruit and 
put the sirup into a preserving-kettle. Boil and skim it until 
it is perfectly clear ; then, while it is boiling hot, pour it 
over the fruit, and let it stand uncovered until it becomes 
entirely cold. If it stands covered, the steam will fall into 
the sirup and thin it. 

Preserved Pears. — Preserved pears are put up precisely as 
are peaches, but are only pared, not cored or divided. I^eave 
the stems on. 

Watermelon Rind Preserves.— Select rind which is firm, 
green, and thick ; cut in any fanciful shape, such as leaves, 
stars, diamonds, etc. Then weigh, and to each pound of 
rind allow one and a half pounds of loaf sugar. To green 
them, take a brass or copper kettle, and to a layer of grape- 
vinf^ leaves, which should be well washed, add a layer of 
the rind, and so on until the last, which should be a thick 
layer of the leaves, and well covered with a coarse linen 
cloth. To each pound of the rind, add a piece of alum the 
size of a pea ; then fill up with warm water sufficient to 
cover the whole, and let it stand upon the stove, where it 
will steam, but not boil, until the greening is completed, 
which will be in two or three hours. When green, lay them 
in clear, cold water, and make your sirup. To each pound 
of sugar add one and a half pints of water ; clarify, put in 



216 ^-^-^ HOUSEWIFE'' S LIBRARY. 

your rind ; slice lemons, two to each pound of rind, and 
when about half done add the lemons. Boil until the rind 
is perfectly transparent. A few pieces of ginger-root may 
be added, which will impart a high flavor, and will blend 
very delightfully with the lemons. 

Preserved Citron. — Proceed the same as above, substituting 
citron for the watermelon rind. 

Preserved Strawberries. — Procure fresh, large strawberries 
when in their prime, but not so ripe as to be very soft ; hull 
and weigh them ; take an equal weight of sugar, make a 
sirup, and when boiling hot, put in the berries. A small 
^quantity only should be done at once. If crowded, they 
will become mashed. Let them boil about twenty minutes, 
or a half an hour ; turn into tumblers or small jars, and seal 
with Q%^ papers while hot. 

Preserved Cherries. — Wash, stem, and stone the cherries ; 
save every drop of the juice, and use it in place of water in 
making the sirup. Make a sirup, allowing a pound of sugar 
to every pound of fruit; add the fruit, and let it simmer 
gently for half an hour, skimming as is necessary. 

Damson Preserves. — To four pounds of damsons use three 
pounds of sugar ; prick each damson with a needle ; dis- 
solve the sugar with one-half pint of water, and put it on 
the fire ; when it simmers, put in as many damsons as will 
lie on the top ; when they open, take them out and lay them 
on a dish, and put others in, and so on until all have been 
in ; then put them all in the kettle together and let them 
stew until done ; put them in jars and seal them. 

Green Gage Preserves. — When the fruit is ripe, wipe them 
clean, and to one pound of fruit put one-quarter pound of 
sugar, which will make a fine sirup ; boil the fruit in this 
sirup until it is perfectly done ; then use a fresh sirup of one 
pound of fruit to one pound of sugar; moistening the sugar 



JELLIES, JAMS, AND PRESERVFS. 217 

with water. When the sirup boils put in the fruit, and leave 
for fifteen minutes ; then put the fruit in jars ; boil the sirup 
until thick ; when cooled to milkwarm, pour it over the 
fruit ; tie the jars tightly and keep in a warm place. 

Strawberries in Wine. — Put a quantity of the finest large 
strawberries in a bottle, strew in a few spoonfuls of pow- 
dered sugar, and fill the bottle up with Madeira or Sherry 
wine. 

Grapes in Brandy. — Take some close bunches of grapes, 
white or black, not overripe, and lay them in ajar. Put a 
good quantity of pounded white candy upon them, and fill 
up the jar with brandy. Tie them close dov/n, and keep in 
a dry place. Prick each grape with a needle three times. 

Brandy Peaches. — Take large, juicy freestone peaches, not 
so ripe as to burst or mash on being handled. Rub the 
down from them with a clean thick flannel. Prick every 
peach down to the stone with a large silver fork, and score 
them all along the seam or cleft. To each pound of peaches 
allow a pound of granulated sugar and half a pint of water 
mixed with half a white of Qg%, slightly beaten. Put the 
sugar into a porcelain kettle and pour the water upon it. 
V/hen it is quite melted, give it a stirring, set it over the 
fire,, and boil and skim it till no more scum rises. Then 
put in the peaches, and let them cook (uncovered) in the 
sirup till a straw will penetrate them. Then take the kettle 
off the fire, and take out the fruit with a wooden spoon, 
draining it over the kettle. Let the sirup remain in the ket- 
tie a little longer. Mix a pint of the very best white brandy 
for each pound of peaches, with the sirup, and boil them 
together ten minutes or more. Transfer the peaches to 
large glass jars, making each about two-thirds full, and 
pour the brandy and sirup over them, filling the jars full. 
When cool, cover closely. 

Spiced Peaches. — Seven pounds of fruit, one pint vinegar, 



218 THE HOUSE WIFE'S LIBRAE V. 

three pounds sugar, two ounces cinnamon, one-half ounce 
cloves. Scald together the sugar, vinegar, and spices; pour 
over the fruit. Let it stand twenty-four hours ; drain off, 
scald again, and pour over fruit, letting it stand another 
twenty-four hours. Boil all together until the fruit is tender. 
Skim it out, and boll the liquor until thickened. Pour over 
the fruit and set away in a jar. 

Apple Butter. — Boil down a kettieful of cider to two- 
thirds the original quantity. Pare, core, and slice juicy 
apples, and put as many into the cider as it v/ill cover. Boil 
slowly, stirring often with a flat stick, and when the apples 
are tender to breaking, take them out with a perforated 
skimmer, draining well against the sides of the kettle. Put 
in a second supply of apples and stew them soft, as many 
as the cider will hold. Take from the fire, pour all together 
into a tub or large crock ; cover and let it stand twelve 
hours. Then return to the kettle and boil down, stirring all 
the while until it is the consistency of thick custard and 
brown in color. Spice well with D. & L. SladeCo.'s Pure 
Spices. 

Peach Butter. — To one bushel of peaches allow from eight 
to ten pounds of granulated sugar; pare and halve the 
peaches, put into the kettle, and stir constantly, to prevent 
sticking to the kettle, until perfectly smooth and rather 
thick ; a part of the peach-stones thrown in and cooked 
with the peaches give it a nice flavor, and they can be after- 
ward skimmed out ; add the sugar a short time before tak- 
ing from the fire; put in jars and cover tight; peaches for 
butter should be neither too mealy nor too juicy.

XVI.— CANNED FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. 

widespread use of canned goods; philosophy of canning 
fruits; how to fill the jars; what jars are best; selec- 
tion OF THE FRUIT ; WHERE TO STORE THE CANS ; NEED OF 
WATCHING THE CANS. TWELVE RECIPES OF CANNING FRUIT 
AND VEGETABLES. 

CANNED fruits and vegetables of all kinds may now be 
found abundantly in the stores. Their prices are so 
low that they present a strong inducement to the 
housekeeper to omit the labor incident to home canning, and 
simply to purchase what is needed. 

What is aimed at in all these processes is the entire ex- 
clusion of air from the fruit. Its expulsion from them is 
effected by using heat enough to cook them, after which the 
hermetical sealing does the remaining service. Solder, wax, 
and rubber bands do this sealing work. 

If it is desired to preserve the fruit whole, it may be put 
into the jars before heating. Fill the jars with water, and 
set them into a wash-boiler of cold water, the water reach- 
ing three-fourths of the way to the tops of the jars. Do not 
set them directly on the bottom, but on a little hay, lest the 
heat cause them to crack. Bring the water slowly to a boil, 
aiid let it boil about five minutes. The cans may then be 
taken out, stirred lightly, or shaken, to expel any remaining 
air bubbles ; then fill to the brim with boiling water and 
close the jars. No air bubbles should remain in the can. 
If the fruit can be cooked before canning, the process is 
much simpler, as the boiling material itself expels the air. 
The cans in this case need simply to be filled and then 
sealed.

RECIPES. 

Canned Strawberries. — Fill glass jars with fresh strawberries 
sprinkled with sugar, allowing a little over one-quarter of a 
pound of sugar to each pound of berries ; set the jars in a 
boiler, with a little hay laid in the bottom to prevent the 
jars from breaking ; fill with cold water to within an inch or 
two of the tops of the jars ; let them ^^// fifteen minutes, then 
move back to the boiler, wrap the hand in a towel, and take 
out the jars ; fill the jars to the top before sealing, using one 
or more of the filled jars for that purpose if necessary. 

Canned Gooseberries. — Fill very clean, dry, wide-necked 
bottles with gooseberries gathered the same day and before 
they have attained their full growth. Cork them tightly, 
wrap a little hay round each of them, and set them up to 
their necks in a kettle of cold water, which should be 
brought very gradually to boil. Let the fruit be gently 
simmered until it appears shrunken and perfectly scalded ; 
then take out the bottles, and with the contents of one or 
two fill up the remainder. Use great care not to break the 
fruit in doing this. When all are ready, pour scalding 
water into the bottles and cover the gooseberries entirely 
with it, or they will become moldy at the top. Cork the 
bottles well immediately, and cover the necks with melted 
resin ; keep them in a cool place ; and when they are used 
pour off the greater part of the water and add sugar as for 
the fresh fruit. 

Canned Peaches.— Peel and quarter choice peaches. To 
peel, place them in a wire basket, dip into boiling water a 
moment and then into cold water, and strip off the skins. 
Have a porcelain-kettle with boiling water and another with 
sirup made with granulated sugar ; drop the peaches into 
boiling water (some previously boil the pits in the water for 
their flavor) and let them cook until tender; then lift them 
out carefully into a can, pouring over them all the sirup the 



CANNED FRUITS, ETC. 221 

can will hold, and seal immediately. Cook only peaches 
enough to fill one can at a time. 

Canned Peaches, No. 2. — Pare and stone peaches enough for 
two jars at a time. If many are pared, they will become dark 
colored by standing. Rinse in cold water ; then cook in a 
rich sirup of sugar and water about fifteen or twenty minutes, 
or until they are clear. Put into jars all that are not broken; 
fill up with the hot sirup, about as thick as ordinary mo- 
lasses, and seal. The same sirup will do to cook several jars. 
After the sirup becomes dark, it, with the broken peaches, 
can be used for marmalade or peach butter. The same 
method can be used for pears, plums, and all light fruits. 

Oaimed Pineapple.-^ — Use three-fourths of a pound of sugar 
to one pound of fruit. Pick the pineapple to pieces with a 
silver fork. Scald and can while hot. 

Canned Grapes. — Squeeze the pulp from the skin ; boil the 
pulp until the seeds begin to loosen, having the skins boiling 
hard and separately in a little water. When the pulp seems 
tender, put it through the sieve ; then add the skins, if ten- 
der, with the water they boil in, if not too much. Use a 
large coffeecupful of sugar for a quart can ; boil until thick, 
and can in the usual way. 

Canned Plums. — Prick each plum with a needle to prevent 
bursting; prepare a sirup, allowing a gill of pure water and 
a quarter of a pound of sugar to eveiy three quarts of fruit. 
When the sugar is dissolved and the v/ater blood-warm, put 
in the plums. Heat slovvdy to a boil. Let them boil five 
minutes — not fast or they will break badly — fill up the jars 
with plums, pour in the scalding sirup until it runs down 
the sides, and seal. Green gages are very fine put up in this 
way, also damsons for pies. 

Canned Pears. — Select finely flavored fruit ; either halve and 
core them or core whole ; make a sirup of sugar and water, 



222 ^-^^ HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

using as little water as will dissolve the sugar. Add a 
quarter of a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit. Place the 
fruit in the kettle carefully, and let it come to a boil or until 
the fruit is well scalded. Turn into the jars hot, and seal at 
once. 

Canned Tomatoes. — Pour boiling water over the tomatoes 
to loosen the skins. Remove these ; drain off all the juice 
that will come away without pressing hard ; put them into a 
kettle and heat slowly to a boil. The tomatoes will look 
much nicer if all the hard parts be removed before putting 
them on the fire. Rub the pulp soft with your hands. Boil 
half an hour ; dip out the surplus liquid, pour the tomatoes, 
boiling hot, into the cans, and seal. Keep in a cool, dark 
place. 

Canned Beaais. — Remove the strings at the sides, and cut 
into pieces about an inch long ; put them into boiling water 
and scald, then can them. 

Canned Asparagus. — Cut away all the hard part of the stem 
and boil the top portion until nearly done, just as if about 
to serve at once. Flat cans are best, into which the stems 
can be laid regularly, the water in which they were boiled 
being poured over them boiling hot, and the can sealed. If 
jars or high cans are used, pack the .asparagus into them 
until they are full. Fill the cans with water ; set them on 
hay in a boiler of cold water reaching to within an inch of 
their tops ; then bring to a boil and nearly finish cooking 
the stems. Wrap the hand in a towel ; take out the cans 
and seal or solder them as in other vegetables. 

Canned Corn. — Boil sweet corn till nearly done ; cut close 
from the cobs and fill the jars ; pour on water in which the 
corn was boiled ; place in a boiler and just bring to a boil, 
as above • then take out and seal.

XVII.— PICKLES AND CATSUPS. 

KCKLES MORE POPULAR THAN WHOLESOME ; GREENING PICKLES ; 
WHAT KETTLES AND JARS SHOULD NOT BE USED IN PICKLING; 
CHOOSING THE FRUIT, SPICES, ETC. ; HOW TO KEEP PICKLES ; 
CATSUPS, HOW MADE, ETC. THIRTY-THREE RECIPES FOR PICKLES 
AND CATSUPS. 

PICKLES are very popular as a relish, but it must be 
confessed that they are not the most wholesome diet. 
This is due chiefly to the fact that they are made of 
hard, crude, and often of unripe fruit. Then, too, the ex- 
cess of acid and the high seasoning disagree with many 
constitutions. 

It is deemed important that pickles for the market be 
well greened. To accomplish this end, copperas and other 
chemicals are employed or copper kettles are used. All 
this is poisonous, and should be shunned. No metal ket- 
tles or spoons should be tolerated in pickling. Glazed jars 
are not desirable either, as salt and vinegar decompose the 
glazing and set free the lead which it contains. An ordinary 
stone jar is the vessel to use, or a porcelain-lined kettle. 

Be careful to select perfectly sound fruit or vegetables for 
pickling, and use none but the very best cider vinegar. 
Good white wine vinegar does well for some sorts of pickles, 
but be ever watchful against chemical preparations called 
vinegar, that destroy instead of preserving the articles put 
away in them. In the selection of spices there is so much 
diversity of taste that no general directions will be of prac- 
tical value. But get the purest articles you can find. 

Pickles must be kept from the air. It is a good plan to 



224 1^^^ ^^ ^^^ WIFE'S L IBRAR K 

put them up in large jars, and for use to empty the large 
jar at once into smaller ones, using these one at a time- 
Keep them wholly covered with the vinegar. Water will 
soon cause the jar of pickles to spoil. 

The same hints given above apply to the making of cat- 
sup, which is really but a pickle cooked to a more advanced 
point. It needs to be tightly corked and sealed, that it may 
keep well. 

RECIPES. 

Cucumber Pickles. — Make a weak brine, hot or cold ; if hot, 
let the cucumbers stand in it twenty-four hours ; if cold, 
forty-eight hours ; rinse and dry the cucumbers with a cloth, 
take vinegar enough to cover them, allow one ounce of 
alum to every gallon of vinegar, put it in a brass kettle (or 
porcelain-lined, if the greejtmg is not desired) with the 
cucumbers, and heat slowly, turning the cucumbers from 
the bottom frequently ; as soon as they are heated through, 
skim them out into a crock, let the vinegar boil up, turn it 
over the pickles, and let them stand at least twenty-four 
houis; drain off the vinegar. Take fresh vinegar, and to 
every gallon allow two tablespoofuls of white nmstard-seed, 
one of cloves, one of celery-seed, one of stick cinnamon, 
one large, green pepper, a very little horse-radish, and, if 
you like, one-half pint of sugar. Divide the spices equally 
into several small bags of coarse muslin, scald with the vine- 
gar, and pour over the pickles. If you like your pickles 
hard, let the vinegar cool before pouring over them. 

Cucumber Pickles, No. 2. — To a gallon of water add a quart 
of salt, put in the cucumbers, and let them stand over night. 
In the morning, wash them out of the brine, and put them 
carefully into a stone jar. Boil a gallon of vinegar, put in, 
while cold, quarter of a pound of cloves, and a tablespoon- 
ful of alum ; when it boils hard, skim it well and turn over 
the cucumbers. In a week they will be fit for use.

PICKLES AND CATSUPS. 225 

Pickled Carrot. — Boil carrots until tender, cut into 
fancy shapes, and put them into strong vinegar. Spice 
or flavor to suit taste. This is a pretty garnish and an 
excellent pickle. 

Pickled Barberries. — Soak nice large bunches of bar- 
berries in salt and water for a few hours. Remove 
from the water and pour scalding vinegar over them. 
Spice the vinegar if you prefer. These are ornamental 
for salad-garnishing. They may be kept in the brine 
and freshened when used. — The Peerless Cook 
Book : Mrs, D, A, Lincoln, Redding & Co, ^Publishers, 

Pickled Pears. — Take half a peck of pears halved and 
cored, lay the pieces together, and pack them all closely 
together in a preserving-kettle. Add two ounces of cin- 
namon-bark and half an ounce of cloves, two pounds of 
sugar, and one pint of vinegar ; cover them up and set 
on a slow fire to boil. Boil down until thoroughly 
cooked. Put in a stone jar and cover with white paper 
wet with brandy. 

Pickled Muskmelon. — Take a ripe melon (cantaloupe), 
peel, and cut in blocks. Then take two tablespoonfuls 
of pulverized alum dissolved in hot water, pour over and 
add cold water until they are covered. (Press them 
down with a plate.) Let them stand over night, then 
drain off, and rinse well with cold water. Take a quart 
of vinegar and two pounds of sugar, boil and turn over. 
Do this for nine mornings, adding the vinegar and sugar 
if necessary. The ninth morning tie up in a thin muslin 
bag an ounce of cloves and two ounces of cinnamon- 
bark, boil in vinegar, then add your melon and boil for 
a short time. In putting the pickle away in a jar, place 
the muslin bag containing the spices among them on the 
top. 



226 THE HO USE WIFE S LIBRAE K 

Pickled Onions. — Select small white onions, put them ovci- 
the fire in cold water with a handful of salt. When the 
water becomes scalding hot, take them out and peel off the 
skins, lay them in a cloth to d^ry ; then put them in a jar. 
Boil half an ounce of allspice and half an ounce of cloves 
in a quart of vinegar. Take out the sp'ce and pour the 
vinegar over the onions while it is hot. Tie up the jar when 
the vinegar is cold, and keep it in a dry place. 

Pickled Onions, No. 2. — Take small, white onions and peel 
them ; lay them in salt water for two days ; change the water 
once ; then drain and put them in bottles. Take vinegar 
enough to cover them, spice with whole mixed spices, scald 
it, and pour over the onions. 

Pickled Garlic and Eschalots. — Garlic and eschalots may U* 
pickled in the same way as onions. 

Pickled Nasturtiums. — Nasturtiums should be gathered 
quite young, and a portion of the buds, when very small, 
should be mixed with them. Prepare a pickle by dissolv- 
ing an ounce and a half of salt in a quart of pale vinegar, 
and throw in the berries as they become fit, from day to 
day. They are used instead of capers for sauce, and by 
some persons are preferred to them. When purchased for 
pickling, put them at once into a jar and cover them well 
with the vinegar. 

Pickled Watermelon. — Take the outer part of the rind of 
the melon, pare and cut in small pieces. To one quart of 
vinegar add two pounds of sugar, one ounce of cassia buds. 
In this boil the rind until clear and tender. 

Pickled Walnuts. — Walnuts for this pickle must be gathered 
while a pin can pierce them easily. When once the shell 
can be felt, they have ceased to be in a proper state for it 
Make sufficient brine to cover them well, with six ounces q{ 
salt to the gallon of water ; take off the scum, which will 



PICKLES AND CATSUPS. 227 

rise to the surface as the salt dissolves, throw in the walnuts, 
and stir them night and morning ; change the brine every 
three days, and if they are wanted for immediate eating, 
leave them in it for twelve days ; otherwise, drain them 
from it in nine, spread them on dishes, and let them remain 
exposed to the air until they become black ; this will be in 
twelve hours, or less. Make a pickle for them with some- 
thing more than iidf a gallon of vinegar to the hundred, a 
teaspoonful of salt, two ounces of black pepper, three of 
bruised ginger, a drachm of mace, and from a quarter to 
half an ounce of cloves (of which some may be stuck into 
three or four small onions), and four ounces of mustard- 
seed. Boil the whole of these together for about five min- 
utes ; have the walnuts ready in a stone jar, or jars, and 
pour the vinegar on them as soon as it is taken from the fi.re. 
When the pickle is quite cold, cover the jar securely and 
store it in a dry place. Keep the walnuts always vvell 
covered with vinegar, and boil that which is added to them. 

Pickled Red Cabbage. — Slice the red cabbage into a colan- 
der, and sprinkle each layer with salt ; let it drain two days, 
then put it into a jar and pour boiling vinegar enough to 
cover, and put in a few slices of red beet-root. Use the 
purple red cabbage. Cauliflower cut in bunches, and 
thrown in after being salted, v/ill take on the color of a 
beautiful red. 

Pickled Muslirooms.— Rub the mushroom heads with flan- 
nel and salt, throw them in a stewpan with a little salt over 
them ; sprinkle with pepper and a small quantity of mace ; 
as the liquor comes out, shake them well, and keep them 
over a gentle fire until all the liquor is dried into them 
again ; then put as much vinegar into the pan as will cover 
them ; give it a scald, and pour the whole into bottles. 

Pickled Beets. — Wash the beet perfectly, not cutting any 
of the fibrous roots, lest the juice escape ; put in sufticient 



228 THE HO USE WIFE' S L IBRAR Y. 

v/ater to boil it, and when the skin will come off easily it is 
sufficiently cooked, and may be taken out and laid upon a 
cloth to cool. Having rubbed off the peel, cut the beet 
into thick slices, pour over it cold vinegar prepared as fol- 
lows : Boil a quart of vinegar with an ounce of whole black 
pepper and an equal weight of dry ginger, and let it stand 
until quite cold. Keep closely corked. 

Pickled Peppers. — Do not pick them till just as they begin 
to turn red ; then soak them for ten or twelve days in strong 
salt and water ; take them from the brine and soak them 
in clear water for a day. Wipe them dry, and put them 
away in cold vinegar ; or if you wish them milder, remove 
the seeds and scald the vinegar, but do not boil. 

Pickled Bell Peppers. — Cut a slit in the side of each pepper 
and take out all the seeds. Let them soak in brine (strong 
enough to float an ^^^ two days. Then, washing them in 
cold water, put them into a stone jar. Pour over them vine- 
gar boiled with cinnamon, mace, and nutmeg. Whenever 
they are wanted to be served, stuff each one with a boiled 
tongue cut into dice and mixed with a mayonnaise dressing. 
Or little mangoes may be made, stuffing each one with 
pickled nasturtiums, grapes, minced onions, red cabbage, or 
cucumbers, seasoned with mustard-seed, root ginger, and 
mace. 

Pepper-hash. — Take four dozen peppers, two very large 
cabbages, one ounce oi light mustard-seed. Chop the 
peppers fine, cut the cabbage on a cabbage-knife, mix to- 
gether, salt v/ell, and let it stand over night, putting the 
dish or tub so the juice will run down ; pour off in the 
morning. Add one ounce of cloves, one ounce of allspice ; 
mix all through, and put the vinegar on cold. 

Flint Pickles. — Make a brine of a gallon of water and a 
cupful of salt. This must be poured boiling hot on the cu- 
cumbers six days in succession. Rinse them in cold water; 



PICKLES AND CA TSUPS. 229 

put them in a kettle with a teaspoonful of allspice and a tea- 
spoonful of cloves, a handful of cinnamon sticks, a little 
sliced horse-radish, and cider vinegar to cover them. Let 
them come to a boil, then take out and put in jars. 

East India Pickle. — One hundred cucumbers (large and 
small), one peck of green tomatoes, one-half peck of onions, 
four cauliflowers, four red peppers (without the seeds), four 
heads of celery, one pint of bottled horse-radish. Slice all, 
and stand in salt twenty-four hours, then drain ; pour on 
weak vinegar ; stand on stove until it comes to a boil ; then 
drain again. Take one ounce of ground cinnamon, one 
ounce of ground tumeric, one-half pound of mustard, one- 
quarter pound of brown sugar; wet these with cold vinegar; 
add to this sufficient vinegar to moisten all the pickles. 
Cook all together ten minutes. Seal in bottles while hot. 

Frencll Pickle. — Take one peck of green tomatoes, sliced; 
six large onions. Throw on them a teacupful of salt over night. 
Drain thoroughly, then boil in two quarts of water and one 
quart of vinegar fifteen or tv/enty minutes; drain in colan- 
der ; then take four quarts of vinegar, two pounds of brown 
sugar, one-half pound of white mustard-seed, two table- 
spoonfuls of cloves, two tablespoonfuls of cinnamon, two 
tablespoonfuls of ginger, two tablespoonfuls of ground 
mustard, one teaspoonful of cayenne pepper ; put all to- 
gether and cook fifteen mmutes. 

PiccaUily. — One peck of green tomatoes sliced, one-half 
peck of onions sliced, one cauliflower, one peck of small cu- 
cumbers. Leave in salt and water twenty-four hours ; then 
put in a kettle with a handful of scraped horse-radish, one 
ounce of tumeric, one ounce of whole cloves, one-quarter 
pound of whole pepper, one ounce of cassia buds or cinna- 
mon, one pound of white mustard-seed, one pound of Eng- 
lish mustard. Put in kettle in layers, and cover with cold 
vinegar. Boil fifteen minutes, constantly stirring.

water one night; cook all the vegetables in brine until 
tender except the large cucumbers. Pour vinegar and 
spices over all. 

Sweet Pickles. — Such fruit as peaches, plums, cherries, 
grapes, etc., are very palatable when sweet pickled. The 
process is the same as for other light pickles, except that 
the vinegar is sweetened to taste. 

Sweet Tomato Pickles.—Eight pounds of peeled tomatoes, 
four of powdered sugar. Of cinnamon, cloves, and allspice, 
each one ounce. Boil one hour, and add a quart of boiling 
vinegar.

of mustard-seed, three dessertspoonfuls of sweet oil, one 
ounce of allspice, one ounce of cloves, one ounce of ground 
mustard, one ounce of ground ginger, two tablespoonfuls of 
black pepper, two teaspoonfuls of celery-seed, one-quarter 
pound of brown sugar. Put all into a preserving-pan, cover 
with vinegar, and boil two hours. 

CMli Sauce.— -Thirty tomatoes, three large onions, three 
peppers, one tablespoonful each of allspice, cloves, and cin- 
namon, two nutmegs, two tablespoonfuls of salt, one quart of 
vinegar, one cupful of sugar. Chop the onions and pep- 
pers very fine. Cook the tomatoes somewhat first. Mix

spice, two tablespoonfuls of cinnamon, two tablespoonfuls of 
cloves, one and one-half teaspoonfuls of mace, one teaspoon- 
ful of salt« one and one-half teaspoonfuls of red pepper. Boil 
till thick ; then bottle and seal tightly. 

Walnut Catsup.— The vinegar in which walnuts have been 
pickled, when they have remained in it a year, will generally 
answer all the purposes for which this catsup is required, 
particularly if it be drained from them and boiled for a few 
minutes, with a. little additional spice and a few eschalots-, 
but where the vinegar is objected to, it may be made by 



2 32 THE HO USE WIFE'S LIBRAE Y. 

boiling either the expressed juice of young walnuts for an 
hour, with six ounces of fine anchovies, four ounces of 
eschalots, half an ounce of black pepper, a quarter ounce of 
cloves, and a drachm of mace to every quart. 

Walnut Catsup, No. 2. — Pound in a mortar a hundred young 
walnuts, strewing among them as they are done half a 
pound of salt ; then pour to them a quart of strong vinegar 
and let them stand until they have become quite black, 
keeping them stirred three or four times a day ; next add a 
quart of strong, old beer, and boil the whole together for ten 
minutes ; strain it, and let it remain until the next day ; then 
pour it off clear from the sediment, add to it one large head 
of garlic bruised, half an ounce of nutmegs bruised, the same 
quantity of cloves and black pepper, and two drachms of 
mace ; boil these together for half an hour, and the follow- 
ing day bottle and cork the catsup well. 

A bottle of port wine may be added before bottling, if de- 
sired, and a large bunch of sweet herbs. 

Oyster Catsup. — Take fine, large fresh oysters, opened care- 
fully, and wash them in their own liquor. To take any par- 
ticle of shell that may remain, strain the liquor after. Pound 
the oysters in a mortar, add the liquor, and to every pint 
put a pint of sherry ; boil it up and skim ; then add two 
anchovies, pounded, an ounce of common salt, two drachms 
of pounded mace, and one of cayenne. Let it boil up, then 
skim, and rub it through a sieve. Botde when cold and 
seal it. What remains in the sieve will do for oyster sauce.

FLAVOR; THE COFFEE-POT; CHOCOLATE AND ITS PREPARA-

WHAT is worth doing at all in culinary lines is 
worth doing well, and beverages, being in the 
line of luxuries, should be good, if not posi- 
tively luxuriant. Employ good materials, and do not 
stint them in quantity, if you want good results. 

Tea is the leaf of the tea-tree cured in various ways, 
and the difference between good tea and poor tea is due 
mainly to methods of picking and curing the leaf. 
* The housekeeper has no means of knowing the qual- 
ity of the tea she buys until it is ready for drinking, 
and the dealer has usually no means of knowing the 
manner in which the tea he sells is picked and cured. 

Of the hundred million pounds of tea sent to this 
country each year, fully three-quarters is of low grade. 
It is probable that it requires twenty times as many days* 
labor to produce a given quantity of choice tea as it does 
to produce the same amount of the lower grades. 

In order to be sure of securing choice tea, the house- 
keeper should buy for her supplies goods sold by deal- 
ers who are in a position to know all about the tea sold, 
from the time it is picked. 

The old-established Oriental Tea Company still dis- 
tributes, in the writer's opinion, the most satisfactory 
brands, notv/ithstanding the extensive advertising in- 
dulged in by some of the newer tea-houses. 



234 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

The nutritive value of tea is not appreciable, but as an 
excitant of respiratory action and promoter of digestion it 
is very valuable. Tea should be kept closely covered in 
air-tight canisters, in order that the flavor may be retained. 

Coffee will grow in any climate where the temperature 
does not fall below fifty-live degrees. The best brands 
are obtained, however, when regard is had for climate 
and soil ; when skill is used in gathering and curing ; 
and when the preparation for and roasting of the coffee 
has been under the direction of trained and experienced 
experts. But a few years ago the securing of good cof- 
fee was a matter of chance. To-day there are several 
good brands on the market; but the writer has found 
Spurr's Revere Coffee to be by far the most satisfactory. 

Coffee should be kept in tight canisters or boxes. 
The coffee-pot must be scalded clean and occasionally 
with soda, so that the inside maybe absolutely pure. 

Chocolate should never be made except it is intended 
to be used immediately. By allowing it to become cold 
or by boiling it again, the flavor is injured, the oily par- 
ticles of the cocoa are separated and rise to the surface 
also, and they will never blend pleasantly again. 

RECIPES. 

Tea. — Tea is best made in an earthenware tea-pot, 
and should never be made in a vessel made of tin. Use 
boiling water, but do not boil the tea. Allow one tea- 
spoonful for each person. Use the Oriental Tea Com- 
pany's teas — Garden Formosa, first picking, uncolored 
Japan tea, or for afternoon teas use Scented Orange 
Pekoe and Garden Flowery Pekoe. 

Iced Tea. — Iced tea should be made several hours before 
it is needed and set on ice. When ready to use it, sweet- 
en and drink without milk or cream. Use cracked ice 



BE VERA GES. 235 

to put into the glass. The tea must be extra strong, and 
do not stint the ice. 

Tea a la Rnsse. — Slice fresh, juicy lemons ; pare care- 
fully, lay a piece in the bottom of each cup ; sprinkle with 
white sugar and pour tea, very hot and strong, over them. 

Iced Tea a la Russe. — To each goblet of cold tea (with- 
out cream) add the juice of half a lemon. Fill up with 
pounded ice and sweeten well. A glass of champagne 
added to this makes what is called Russian punch. 

Coffee. — To make choicest coffee, take Spurr's Revere 
Coffee ground to about the fineness of granulated sugar, 
and use one ounce or one tablespoonful to a pint of water. 
Mix one ^gg with the ground coffee and put into the cof- 
fee pot. Pour the water, which should be boiling hot, on 
it ; allow it to boil for one minute. Then pour m a very 
little cold water which will settle the grounds and clarify 
the liquid. Serve at once if you would have it at its best. 

The above applies when using an ordinary coffee pot. 
When using a percolating coffee pot, like the Gem coffee 
pot, the coffee should be ground very fine, the boiling 
hot water should be poured over it, and then poured from 
the spout into a hot pitcher, or other vessel, to be ao-ain 
poured over the coffee. This should be repeated two or 
three times in order to get the full strength of the coffee. 

Stronger or weaker coffee can be prepared by using 
more or less water but the proportions given here will 
prove most satisfactory. 

Whatever process you use always thoroughly cleanse 
the coffee pot after each service. 

Meringiied Coffee. — For six cupfuls of coffee take about 
one cupful of sweet cream, whipped light, with a little 
sugar. Put into each cup the desired amount of sucrar 
and about a tablespoonful of boiling milk. Pour the 



236 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

coffee over these, and lay upon the surface of the hot 
liquid a large spoonful of the frothed cream. Give a 
gentle stir to each cup before sending it from the tray. 

Frothed Cafe au Lait. — -Pour into the table urn one quart 
of strong, clear coffee, strained through muslin, and one 
quart boiling milk, alternating them and stirring gently. 
Cover and wrap a thick cloth about the urn for five min- 
utes before it goes to table. Have ready in a cream- 
pitcher the whites of three eggs, beaten stiff, and one 
tablespoonful of powdered sugar, whipped with them. 
Put large spoonful of this froth upon each cupful of cof- 
fee as you pour it out, heaping it slightly in the centre. 

Chocolate. — Scrape fine one square of a cake of Bens=" 
dorp's Chocolate ; add equal weight of sugar ; put these 
into a pint of boiling milk and water, each one-half, and 
stir well for two or three minutes until the sugar and 
chocolate are well dissolved. This preparation may be 
improved by adding a well-beaten ^g^ or two and stirring 
briskly through the mixture with an egg-beater. A tea- 
spoonful of Metcalf *s Water White Vanilla^extract, added 
just before sending to table, is a valuable addition. 

Frothed Chocolate. — One cupful boiling water; three 
pints fresh milk ; three tablespoonfuls Bensdorp's Choco- 
late, grated ; five eggs, whites only, beaten light, and 
two tablespoonfuls powdered sugar for froth. Sweeten 
chocolate to taste ; heat milk to scalding ; wet up choco- 
late with boiling water, and when milk is hot, stir this 
into- it; simmer gently ten minutes, stirring frequently; 
boil up briskly once ; take from fire ; sweeten to taste,

whipped up with the powdered sugar ; cover the surface 
of each cup with the sweetened meringue before dis- 
tributing to the guests. 

Breakfast Cocoa. — rinto a breakfast cup put one-half a 
teaspoonf ul of Bensdorp's Royal Dutch Cocoa, add a table- 
spoonful of boiling water, and mix thoroughly. Then add 
equal parts of boiling water and boiled milk, and sugar 
to the taste. Boiling two or three minutes will im- 
prove it.

Royal Dutch Cocoa into a cup, and a teaspoonful of sugar. 
Mix both well, pour one-half cup of boiling water, v/hile 
stirring it add one-half cup of hot milk, and the Cocoa 
is ready. The Cocoa is much improved by boiling one 
minute. — Af7's. D. A. Lincoln.

over them one pint of cider vinegar and let stand twenty- 
four hours. Strain, and to one pint of juice add one 
pound of sugar ; boil one-half hour, and when cold, bottle 
for use. 

Cherry Brandy. — Use either morello cherries or small black 
cherries ; pick them from the stalks ; fill the bottles nearly 
up to the necks, then fill up with brandy (some use whisky,

Spruce Beer. — To three gallons of boiling water, add two 
pounds oi molasses and two ounces of essence of spruce. 
Let the mixture cool, and when lukewarm, add a scant gill 
of yeast and set aside to ferment. While the fermentation 
goes on, skim frequently. When it becomes inactive, put in 
stone bottles and tie the corks down. White sugar may be 
used instead of molasses, and will give a better color. 

Quick Beer. — To fourteen quarts of water add one quart of 
molasses, one quart of hop yeast, and four tablespoonfuls of 
ginger. Mix well ; strain through a fine sieve ; bottle im- 
mediately. Ready for use in twenty-four hours.

XIX.— CANDIES. 

CARE NEEDED TO COOK CANDY ; WHEN COOKED ENOUGH J FLAVOR- 
ING, COOLING, AND PULLING. TWENTY-ONE RECIPES FOR CANDY. 

THE great danger in candy-making is that of burning the 
sugar. To properly cook the candy requires a heat of 
about two hundred and fifty degrees. Less than that 
heat will leave the candy soft and sticky. A very little more 
than two hundred and sixty degrees will burn it. Here, 
tlien, is the need of care in candy-making. 

In the cooking, allow the heat to reach the bottom of the 
pan only. Have a quick fire that the work may be done in 
llie shortest possible time. When cooked for about fifteen 
minutes, test a spoonful of the mass upon a cold plate. If it 
form a viscid, tenacious mass, which forms a long, adherent 
thread when drawn out, then it is nearly done, and it needs 
special care lest it burn before the work be completed. Test 
frequently now, dropping a little in cold water. When the 
hardened portion is crisp as a pipestem, the cooking hai 
gone far enough. Then comes the flavoring and coloring. 

When the mass has cooled on a stone or buttered plate, 
so that it can be handled, it is ready {ox pulling, rolling into 
sticks, shaping into forms, etc. The pulling process is 
simply a mechanical means of whitening the candy. It is 
literally 2. pulling, the candy being thrown on a hook and 
pulled out from it, then being thrown on it again and again 
pulled, and so on, as may be desired, the longer pulling giv- 
ing the whiter candy. 

For home-made candies use pure materials and good 
fruit. Enough of earths and starch and decayed fruits are 
bought in the cheap candies of the stores.

RECIPES. 

Molasses Candy. — Three cupfuls of brown sugar, one-half 
cupful of molasses, one cupful of water, one-half teaspoonful 
of cream tartar, butter the size of a walnut. Bring to aboil, 
and when crisp by testing in cold water, flavor ; pour out on 
a buttered plate, and pull to whiteness if desired. 

Butter Scotch. — Two cupfuls of sugar, two tablespoonfuk 
of water, a piece of butter the size of an egg. Boil without 
stirring, until it hardens on a spoon. Pour out on buttered 
plates to cool. 

Ice-cream Candy.— Take two cupfuls of granulated sugar, 
half a cupful of water, and add one-quarter of a teaspoonful 
of cream tartar dissolved in a teaspoonful of boiling water. 
Put it in a porcelain kettle, and boil ten minutes without 
stirring it. Drop a few drops into a saucer of cold water or 
on snow. If it become brittle, it is done ; if not, boil till it is. 
Add a piece of butter half as large as an egg while it is on 
the fire, and stir it in. Pour into a buttered tin, and set on 
ice or snow to cool enough to pull it white. Flavor with 
vanilla just before it is cool enough to pull. Work into 
strands and cut into sticks. 

Cream Candy. — One pound of white sugar, three table, 
spoonfuls of vinegar, one teaspoonful of lemon extract, one 
teaspoonful of cream tartar. Add a little water to moisten 
the sugar, and boil until brittle. Put in the extract, then 
turn quickly out on buttered plates. When cool, pull until 
white, and cut in squares. 

Cocoanut Candy. — Grate very fine a sound cocoanut, spread 
it on a dish, and let it dry naturally for three days, as it will 
not bear the heat of an oven, and is too oily for use when 
freshly broken. Four ounces will be sufficient for a pound 
of sugar for most tastes, but more can be used at pleasure. 
To one pound of sugar, take one-half pint of water, a very

little white of ^%'g, and then pour over the sugar ; let it 
stand for a short time, then place over a very clear fire, and 
let it boil for a few minutes ; then set it one side until the 
scum is subsided, clear it off, and boil the sugar until very 
thick ; then strew in the nut, stir and mix it well, and do not 
quit for an instant until it is finished. The pan should not 
be placed on the fire, but over it, as the nut is liable to burn 
with too fierce a heat. 

Almond Candy. — Proceed in the same way as for cocoanut 
candy. Let the almonds be blanched and perfectly dry, and 
do not throw them into the sugar until they approach the 
candying point. 

Candied Nuts and Pmits. — Three cupfuls of sugar, one cup- 
ful of water ; boil until it hardens when dropped in water, 
then flavor with lemon. It must not boil after the lemon is 
put in. Put a nut on the end of a fine knitting needle, take 
out, and turn on the needle until it is cool. If the candy 
gets cold, set on the stove for a few minutes. Malaga 
grapes, and oranges quartered, may be candied in the same 
way. 

Chocolate Caramels. — Two cupfuls of sugar, one cupful 
of warm water, one-half cupful of Bensdorp's Chocolate, 
grated, three-fourths of a cupful of butter. Let it boil 
without stirring until it snaps in water. 

Chocolate Caramels, No. 2. — One cupful rich, sweet cream ; 
one cupful brown sugar ; one cupful white sugar ; seven 
tablespoonfuls Bensdorp's Chocolate ; one tablespoonful 
corn-starch stirred in the cream ; one tablespoonful butter ; 
vanilla flavoring ; soda, size of a pea, stirred into cream.. 
Boil all ingredients, except the chocolate and vanilla ex- 
tract, half an hour, stirring to prevent burning. Reserve 
half of the cream and wet up the chocolate in it, adding 
a very little water if necessary. Draw the saucepan to 
the side of the range, and stir this in well ; put back on 



244 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

the fire and boil ten minutes longer, quite fast, stirring con- 
stantly. When it makes a hard, glossy coat on the spoon, 
it is done. Add the vanilla after taking it from the range. 
Turn into shallow dishes, well buttered. When cold 
enough to retain the impression of the knife, cut into 
squares. 

Lemon Ta^. — Two cupfuls of white sugar, one cupful of 
boiling water, one-quarter cupful of vinegar, one-half cupful 
of butter ; flavor with lemon ; pour in buttered plates to cool. 

Butter Taflfy. — One tablespoonful of vinegar, one cupful of 
sugar, two tablespoonfuls of molasses, and a piece of butter 
the size of an ^gg. When done, add a little soda. 

Cream Chocolates. — For the creams, boil two cupfuls of 
white sugar and one-half cupful of milk for five minutes ; 
add one teaspoonful of vanilla, then beat until stiff enough 
to handle and make into drops. 

For the chocolate^ take six ounces of Bensdorp's 
Chocolate, grate and steam over the teakettle. Drop the 
creams when hard, one at a time, into the hot chocolate, 
using two forks to take them out quickly ; set the 
drop on one fork on the bottom, using the other fork to 
scrape the chocolate off the cream ; gently slip the drop 
upon a buttered dish. If, when cool, the drop sticks to the 
dish, hold it over the steam of the teakettle for an instant. 

Chocolate Creams. — Inside: Two cupfuls of sugar ; one 
cupful of water ; one and a half tablespoonfuls of arrow- 
root ; mix ; let them boil from five to eight minutes ; stir all 
the time. After taking from the fire, stir until it comes 
to a cream. When smooth, add one teaspoonful Met- 
calf's Water White Vanilla and make cream into balls. 

Outside: Melt a half pound of Bensdorp's Choco- 
late, but do not add water to it. Roll the cream balls 
into the chocolate while it is warm. 



CANDIES, 245 

Cream Walnuts. — Two cupfuls sugar, two-thirds cupful 
water. Boil without stirring until it will spin a thread; 
flavor with vanilla. Set off into a dish with a little cold 
water in it ; stir briskly until white and creamy. Have the 
walnuts shelled ; make the cream into small, round cakes 
with your fingers ; press half a walnut on either side, and 
drop into sifted granulated sugar. 

Cream Dates. — For cream dates, take fresh California dates, 
remove the stones, and fill the centre of dates with the same 
cream as used in cream walnuts. Drop into sugar. 

Peanut Candy. — Boil one scant pint of molasses until it 
hardens in cold water. Stir in two tabiespoonfuls of vanilla^ 
then one teaspoonful of soda, dry. Lastly, the shelled pea- 
nuts, taken from four quarts measured before shelling. 
Turn out into shallow pans well buttered, and press it down 
smooth with a wooden spoon. 

PhiladelpMa Groundnut Cakes. — Boil two pounds of light 
brown sugar in a preserving kettle, with enough water to 
wet it thoroughly and form a sirup. Have ready a quarter 
of a peck of groundnuts (peanuts). When the sugar begins 
to boil, throw in the white of an ^g% to clear it. Skim and 
try by dropping a little into cold water to see if brittle or 
done. When it is brittle, remove from the fire, and stir in 
the nuts. Drop on wet plates, free from grease. The white 
of &'g^ may be omitted. 

Gum Drops. — Dissolve one pound of gum arable in one and 
a half pints of water; strain and add one pound of refined 
sugar ; beat until the sugar is entirely dissolved. Flavor to 
taste, and add coloring if desired. Then evaporate with a 
slow heat until the mass is thick as honey. Have a shallow 
box, or dish of fine starch ; in this make a series of dents 
with a rounded stick, the size desired for the gum drops. 
Into each of these indentations drop from a spout, or a

spoon, just enough of the thickened mass to fill the cavity, 
then set away in a warm place till the drops become suffi- 
ciently set to allow handling. This may require several 
days. 

Jujube Paste. — Dissolve gum arable, and add sugar as for 
gum drops. Evaporate till very thick, and while still warm 
flavor and pour out into shallow tin pans to cool. 

Fig Paste. — Chop up one pound of figs, and boil in a pint 
of water till reduced to a soft pulp. Strain through a fine 
sieve, and add three pounds of sugar. Evaporate over boil- 
ing water till the paste becomes stiff, then pour it into a 
mold of wooden strips tied together. When cool, cut into 
squares ; sugar each well, and put away for use. Flavors 
may be added to taste, or fresh fruits may be mingled with 
the paste. 

Peppermint Drops. — Mix granulated sugar with enough 
water to form a paste, and put it to boil in a saucepan hav- 
ing a lip from which the contents can be poured or dropped. 
Allow it come almost, but not entirely, to a boil. Stir con- 
tinually. Allow it to cool a little, and flavor to taste with 
strong essence of peppermint. Then drop the mass on 
sheets of tin or of white paper. To drop it properly, allow 
just enough to gather at the lip of the saucepan, and then 
stroke it. off with a piece of stiff wire. They should dry iu 
a warm place.

has long since ceased to be a medical experiment. It has passed beyond 
the field of speculation, and is acknowledged one of the greatest successes 
and achievements of modern medical research and discovery. True it is 
that there are cases of disease which, through neglect, have passed be- 
yond the reach of human skill ; but there is no class of diseases which 
yield so readily to prompt and judicious treatment as those of the pulmo- 
nary organs. Therefore we would advise not only as a matter of safety, 
but for economy's sake, an early resort to this remedy by all those who 
feel the premonitory symptoms of the diseases for which it is a cure.

LIQUID FOOD 



Is the only Food that can be retained by the stomach when it refuses all other Foods, 
and Extracts. Such has been the fact for twenty-three years, as it is the only Raw Food 
known in the world. 

The nutritious properties of meats, and also of fruits, have never been separated 
from their indigestible properties in the raw or cooked state, until I discovered the proc- 
ess in 1881 that has enabled me to make Murdock's Liquid Food. And since then it has 
been made by me and always by the same formula and warranted sweet in all countries 
and of any age. The twelve years, prior to 1(S81, 1 was working, my experiments were 
all failures, and of no more value than other food preparations, as they are only extracts. 
Murdock's Liquid Food is Raw, condensed twelve fold, and free of insoluble matter, 
which enables it to be absorbed without the labor of digestion. 

These facts were confirmed by results obtained in Our Free Surgical Hospital for 
Women, in which we gave 3,872 internal operations with a loss of 6 to the 1,000, when 
women in health die 30 to the 1,000 annually. 

Also confirmed by five Essays before the American Medical Association, of both 
schools, and the British Medical Association, when after the Essays were read they were 
discussed and endorsed by the members. 

Professor S. P. Sharpies', State Chemist for Massachusetts, analysis shows that 
Murdock's Liquid Food contains 16 28-100 per cent, albuminoids. We only claim to 
protect our claim, 12 per cent. 

Again, Dr. Sam. L. Abbot, our State Chemist in 1886, compared Murdock's Liquid 
Food with other foods and tonics, and found it to excel them all, as it contained 14.10 
per cent, of albumen ; all the other foods do not contain any, and common food does 
not contain over one per cent, that is available. 

It contains less organic matter than common food, and common food contains 16.85, 
the other preparations contain 22.62 to 60.50 per cent. It contains 0.42 per cent, of ash, 
which is indigestible matter. The others contain 3.30 to 23.74 per cent. In alcoholic 
extracts 1.97 per cent. The other preparations are all TONICS, as they contain from 
20.13 to 50.10 per cent. 

We make our own extracts from the different fruits we use, instead of using ex- 
tracts from other manufacturers. We use fruit for the properties they possess, and they 
each have different properties, which all scientific men acknowledge to be of as great

XXI. -IN VALID DIET. 

INVALIDS NEED THE BEST OF DIET j WHAT INVALID DIET SHOULD 
furnish; ''SICK-DIET KITCHENS;" HOxME COOKING FOR THE 
SICK. THIRTY RECIPES FOR SICK-ROOM DIET. 

WHAT is more disgusting to an invalid than to be 
served with a Hberal supply of food adapted to a 
laboring man or to a person in robust health ? Deli- 
cate appetites need to be delicately appealed to with dainty 
dishes, nicely served. But these dishes must be nourishing 
and easily digested. In short, the problem in sick-room 
diet is, how to furnish the patient the most valuable nutri- 
tion in the pleasantest form, and with the least tax upon his 
enfeebled powers. 

To meet this need, ors^anized movements have been made 
in many cities in the line of" Sick-Diet Kitchens." Benevo- 
lent contributions and skilled work are the corner-stones of 
these institutions. The foods are well prepared by compe- 
tent hands. The sick who choose to purchase delicacies 
which can be relied on, can find them at these places. 
Those who are too poor to purchase, but who are deserving, 
can have them free. Instruction concerning diet for the sick 
is given also. 

But many cannot reach such establishments, and do not 
care to if they can ; hence the chapter of directions given 
below. If anywhere in cookery good materials and skillful 
manipulation are of value it is in cooking for the sick. 

RECIPES. 

Beef Tea. — One pound of lean beef, cut into small pieces. 
Put into a jar without a drop of water, cover tishtlv. set in

a pot of cold water. Heat gradually to a boil, and continue 
this steadily for three or four hours, until the meat is like 
white rags and the juice all drawn out. Season with salt to 
taste, and when cold, skim. The patient will often prefer 
this ice-cold. 

Beef Tea, No. 2. — Take lean, juicy beef, chopped very finely; 
cover with cold water, and set on back of the range for two 
hours; then draw forward, allowing it to heat gradually; 
then boil for five minutes. Season and strain. 

Mutton Broth. — One pound of lean mutton, cut small ; one 
quart of water, cold ; one tablespoonful of rice or barley, 
soaked in a very little warm water; four tablespoonfuls 
of milk, salt and pepper, with a little chopped parsley. 
Boil the meat, unsalted, in the water, keeping it closely 
covered, until it falls to pieces. Strain it out, add the goaked 
barley or rice; simmer half an hour, stirring often; stir in 
the seasoning and the milk, and simmer five minutes after it 
heats up well, taking care it does not bum. Serve hot, with 
cream cra'^kers. 

CMcken Broth. — Proceed precisely as above, but substitute 

chicken for mutton. 

CMcken Jelly. — Haifa raw chicken, pounded with a mallet, 
bones and meat together ; plenty of cold water to cover it 
well, about a quart. Heat slowly in a covered vessel, and 
let it simmer until the meat is in white rags and the liquid 
reduced one-half Strain and press, first through a colan- 
der, then through a coarse cloth. Salt to taste, and pepper 
if you think best; return to the fire, and simmer five min- 
utes longer. Skim when cool. Give to the patient cold — 
just from the ice — with unleavened wafers. Keep on the 
ice, or make into sandwiches by putting the jelly between 
thin slices of bread spread lightly with butter. 

Soft Boiled Eggs. — Put in a pan of boiling water, and set on 
a part of the range where they will not boil for several min- 



INVALID DIET, 253 

utes. At the end of that time they will be like jelly, per- 
fectly soft, but beautifully done, and quite digestible by even 
weak stomachs. 

Egg GrueL — Beat the yelk of one ^^^ with one tablespoon- 
ful of sugar ; pour one teacupful of boiling water on it ; add 
the white of the egg beaten to a froth, with any seasoning 
or spice desired. To be taken warm. 

Raw Egg. — Break a fresh ^^'g into a glass, beat until very 
light, sweeten to taste, and add two tablespoonfuls of port 
wine, then beat again. 

Egg Cream.— Beat a raw ^g<g to a stiff froth ; add a table- 
spoonful of white sugar and a half wineglass of good black- 
berry wine ; add half a glass of cream ; beat together 
thoroughly, and use at once. 

Indian-meal Gruel. — One tablespoonful of fine Indian-meal, 
mixed smooth with cold water and a saltspoonful of salt ; 
pour upon this a pint of boiling water and turn into a sauce- 
pan to boil gently for half an hour ; thin it with boiling 
water if it thickens too much, and stir frequently ; when it 
is done, a tablespoonful of cream or a little new milk may 
be put in to cool it after straining, but if the patient's stom- 
ach is weak it is best without either. Some persons like it 
sweetened and a little nutmeg added, but to many it is more 
palatable plain. 

Oatmeal GmeL — Soak a handful of oatmeal over night in 
water, in order that the acid gases which oatmeal contains 
may be withdrawn. Pour off the water, and add a pint of 
fresh ; stir it well, add salt, and boil an ho^r and a half. 
This is much used, prepared in this way, by dyspeptics. 

Sago. — Soak and wash it well ; add a pint of water, a little 
salt, and boil till clear. Add lemon-juice or wine, if 
permitted. 

Arrow-root JeUy. — Boil a pint of water with a few bits of 



254 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

cinnamon or yellow rind of lemon ; stir into it two table- 
spoonfuls of arrow-root, dissolved in a little water ; boil ten 
minutes ; strain, salt, and season with sugar, wine, and nut- 
meg, if proper. 

Arrowroot Broth. — Put half a pint of water into a sauce- 
pan ; add a little lemon-juice, sugar and nutmeg, and a very- 
little salt. Boil it up, and stir in a teaspoonful of dissolved 
arrow-root ; boil five minutes. It should be taken warm 
and be very thin. 

Cracked Wheat. — To one quart of hot water take one small 
teacupful of cracked wheat and a little salt ; boil slowly for 
half an hour, stirring occasionally to prevent burning. Serve 
with sugar and cream or new milk. 

Cracker Panada. — Six Boston crackers, split; two table- 
spoonfuls of white sugar, a good pinch of salt, and a little 
nutmeg ; enough boiling water to cover them well. Split the 
crackers, and pile in a bowl in layers, salt and sugar scat- 
tered among them. Cover with boiling water and set on 
the hearth, with a close top over the bowl, for at least an 
hour. The crackers should be almost clear and soft as jelly, 
but not broken. Eat from the bowl with more sugar 
sprinkled in. 

Bread Panada. — Set a little water on the fire in a very 
clean saucepan ; add a glass of wine, if allowed, some sugar, 
nutmeg, and lemon-peel. The moment it boils up stir in a 
few crumbs of stale baker's loaf Let it boil very fast for 
five minutes. It should be only thick enough to drink. 

CMcken Panada. — Boil a chicken ; take a few bits of the 
breast and pound fine in a mortar. Season it with a little 
salt, a grate of nutmeg, and a bit of lemon-peel ; boil gently 
till a little thick, but so that it can be drank. 

Soft Toast. — Some invalids like this very much indeed, and 
nearly all do when it is nicely made. Toast well, but not

too brown, a couple of thin slices of bread ; put them on a 
warm plate and pour over boiling water ; cover quickly with 
another plate of the same size, and drain the water off; re- 
move the upper plate, butter the toast, put it in the oven 
one minute, and then cover again with a hot plate and serve 
at once. 

Milk Porridge. — Two cupfuls of best oatmeal, two cupfuls 
of water, two cupfuls of milk. Soak the oatmeal over night 
in the water; strain in the morning, and boil the water half 
an hour. Put in the milk with a little salt, boil up well, and 
serve. Eat warm, with or without powdered sugar. 

Thickened Milk — With a little milk, mix smooth a table- 
spoonful of flour and a pinch of salt. Pour upon it a quart 
of boiling milk, and when both are thoroughly mingled put 
all back into the saucepan and boil up once, being careful 
not to burn, and stirring all the time to keep it perfectly 
smooth and free from lumps. Serve with slices of dry toast. 
It is excellent in diarrhoea, and becomes a specific by scorch- 
ing the flour before mixing with the milk. 

Toast Water. — Toast stale bread until quite brown, but do 
not burn it ; put it into a large bowl, and pour over it boil- 
ing water ; let it stand for an hour or so, strain, and put in 
a piece of ice before drinking. 

Barley Water. — Soak one pint of barley in lukewarm water 
for a few minutes ; then drain off the water. Put the barley 
in three quarts of cold water and cook slowly until the 
barley is quite soft, skimming occasionally. This barley 
water, when cold, flavor with a little jelly or lemonade. 

Rice Milk, — Pick and wash the rice carefully ; boil it in 
water until it swells and softens ; when the water is partly 
boiled away, add some milk. It may be boiled entirely in 
milk, by setting the vessel iri which the rice is in boiling 
water ; sweeten with white sugar and season with nutmeg. 
It also may be thickened with a little flour or beaten Q%'g. 



256 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Flaxseed Tea. — One-half pound of flaxseed, one-half pound 
of rock candy, and three lemons pared and sliced ; pour 
over this two quarts of boiling water ; let it stand until very- 
cold ; strain before drinking. This is good for a cough. 

Appleade. — Cut two large apples in slices, and pour on 
them one pint of boiling water; strain well and sweeten. 
Ice it before drinking. 

Apple Water. — Roast two large, tart apples until they are 
soft. Put them in a pitcher, pour a pint of cold water on 
them, and let them stand in a cool place for an hour. No 
sweetening is needed. This drink will be found very 
refreshing if the patient have fever or eruptive diseases. 

Roast Apples. — Good-sized, juicy, tart apples are best for 
roasting. Wipe them clean, and put in a slow oven, allow- 
ing an hour for the work of roasting. When entirely done, 
sift fine, white sugar over them, and serve warm or cold, as 
desired. 

Wine Whey. — Sweeten one pint of milk to taste, and when 
boiling throw in two wineglassfuls of sherry ; when the curd 
forms, strain the whey through a muslin bag into tumblers 

Blackberry Sirup. — One quart of blackberry juice, one 
pound of sugar, one-half ounce of nutmeg, one-half ounce 
of cinnamon, one-fourth of an ounce of cloves, one-fourth 
of an ounce of allspice.

XXII. — HEALTH. 

TVT O attempt will be made in this chapter to give in- 
J. J. struction as to the treatment of the sick. When 
any member of the family is so ill that the experience 
of the housewife does npt indicate the treatment to be 
adopted, a physician is the only competent instructor. 

Two-thirds of the diseases that afflict humanity are 
preventable, and the occupant of no other station in 
life has such influence over the well-being of humanity 
as has the housekeeper. This being so, those who 
stand in this high position should perfect themselves in 
the knowledge of the principles of right living. 

The essentials to healthful living, while few in num- 
ber, are too often overlooked or neglec ed. They may 
be stated, in a general way, as follows, although each 
is in some measure dependent upon the others : Pure 
air, water free from pollution, good food, clean sur- 
roundings, exercise and recreation, proper clothing. 
When careful regard for these is maintained, sickness 
will be a rare visitor. 

If, in any way, the human body be deprived of air 
for only a few minutes, death is the result. Normal 
out-of-doors air contains a certain percentage of oxygen, 
and so delicate is the balance of the human system that 
any decrease in this amount of oxygen in the air, by 
even a very small amount, quickly causes a serious dis- 
turbance of the vital functions. 

When the climatic conditions permit of the windows 
being kept open, the ventilation of the house takes care of 
itself ; but at other times it must be carefully attended to. 

The heating of the house is closely connected with 
the subject of ventilation, and the theory that any kind 



258 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

of a heating apparatus or system is all right if it but 
keep the house warm, should be abandoned. The heat- 
ing and ventilating of public halls, theatres, etc., where 
a few of the family go for a few hours occasionally, is 
regulated by strict laws enacted in the interest of the 
public health. How much more important is it that the 
house we live in, where all of us spend from eight to 
twelve hours every day, should be properly warmed and 
ventilated ! 

While it is true that man can live without water for 
a longer time than he can without air, impure water 
is as surely disastrous in its effects upon the human 
system as impure air. In cities and towns where there 
is a public water works, the purity of the water from 
this source can usually be depended upon, in so far as 
public oversight can guarantee it, and is always to be 
preferred to water taken from wells or springs within 
populated districts. Where there is no public water 
works and the supply is obtained from wells, springs, 
cisterns or streams, great care should be taken to make 
sure that no pollution of the supply can have taken 
place. If there is the slightest doubt as to the purity of 
the water supply, whatever the source, it should be 
purified before using by some approved method. 

Undoubtedly among all the things that make for the 
health of the family, none is of greater importance than 
pure food properly prepared. The well-nourished indi- 
vidual has little to fear from disease, and the selection 
and preparation of the food for the family may well 
receive from the housewife the attention that its impor- 
tance deserves. At the present day, when the house- 
keeper has such a variety of food supplies, either wholly 
or partly ready to eat, as well as those which are wholly 



HEALTH. 259 

unprepared, from which to choose, it should be a matter 
of care and attention only to find the food that will agree 
with and properly nourish each member of the family. 

Clean surroundings. — By this term is meant, not simply 
clean to the eye, but actually clean. The dirt that is 
visible to the eye is exposed to the light and air, and is 
rapidly disinfected by these agents. It is the dirt that 
hides under carpets and in dark corners, that lodges in 
the cracks of the wood finish of the sink-room and bath- 
room, that is a source of constant menace to the health 
of the family. For this reason closely joined hardwood 
floors and rugs are to be preferred to carpets, and some 
wall-finish similar to tile is to be preferred over the usual 
deep-jointed w^ood-finish. 

Outside the house the surroundingrs should receive as 
much attention as is bestowed upon the living rooms, for 
the air in those rooms cannot be pure if the outside air is 
polluted with decaying w^aste products. Kitchen garbage 
should not be allowed to stand in open tubs near the 
barck door, and all pipes and drains, both within and 
without the house, should be constructed and maintained 
in accordance with w^ell-established sanitary practice. 

The house should be well screened against flies and 
mosquitoes, for it is now definitely known that these in- 
sects are carriers of disease, and all breeding or swarm- 
ing places for these insects about the premises should be 
done away with. 

Exercise and recreation. — These are exceedingly im- 
portant helps in maintaining health, and each member of 
the family should each day engage for a time in such ex- 
ercise, game or amusement as will give them a complete 
change from what they know as work. If this recreation or 
exercise takes them into the open air, so much the better. 



260 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

By proper clothing is meant clothing in which one 
feels neither too warm nor too cold. A person should be 
so clothed that, as near as possible, the clothing is not 
thought of. Many people heap clothes upon themselves 
and their children, creating conditions of too free per- 
spiration, and then wonder why they feel and are sub- 
ject to the cold. 

When, for any cause, sickness comes to any member 
of the family, accompanied with symptoms which are 
unfamiliar, or which are known to be grave, consult the 
physician at once. Nevertheless, for the treatment of 
those cases with which the housewife has had experi- 
ence, and for use in emergencies, there are certain 
supplies and appliances that should be in every home. 
x\pproved preparations for the treatment of a simple 
cold ; a cough ; indigestion and colic ; constipation ; 
diarrhoea. An approved purgative. Some safe prepa- 
ration to induce sleep. In families where there are 
children, there should always be remedies for use in 
cases of croup or convulsions. 

In addition to the above, there are certain medical 
and surgical appliances that should be kept in every 
home, as they are likely to be needed from time to time, 
and, when needed, must be had promptly. They in- 
clude : u clinical thermometer ; a hot-water bag of at 
least three quarts' capacity ; a hand bulb syringe ; a 
hard rubber syringe of about four ounces' capacity ; an 
atomizer ; a rubber ice-bag ; a glass dropper ; a meas- 
uring glass ; a glass feeding-tube ; antiseptic gauze, 
and some approved disinfectant and germicide for dress- 
ing all wounds, burns and sores, however trivial they 
may appear; a surgeon's scissors; tweezers.

XXIII. —MARKETING. 

OPPORTUNITIES vaiy so in difterent localities, that 
general rules about marketing are hard to frame. In 
rural places the butcher drives to the door, and the 
customer must be content with what is found in the wagon. 
To know the parts of the animals sold in the markets, 
and to understand their relative value and most economical 
uses, is the first requisite in successful marketing. Cutting 
of animals varies somewhat among butchers of different 
places, but the chart given below will fairly set forth the 
usual methods of cutting, and the ordinary designations oi 
the several portions. 




CHART ILLUSTRATING THE CUTTING OF BEEF. 

In explanation of the illustration of the cutting of beef 
the following notes will suffice : 

No. I. — The choice cut of the beef, the Sirloin, containing 
the kidneys and the tenderloin. These are the finest pieces 
of roasting and steak meat. 

No. 2. — T\\Q Standing Rib piece, also a choice roastingpor- 
tion. which includes about eleven of the ribs. 



262 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

No. 3. — The Chuck Ribs, also used for roasting, but of z 
less desirable quality and usually sold at a lower price. 

No. 4. — The neck, with considerable bone, used generally 
for stewing and for pot roast. 

No. 5. — The Cheek, or jowl, a fleshy part, used for stew- 
ing or for boiling. 

No. 6.— The Rump, sometimes cut differently from the 
manner shown in the diagram, which is the usual cutting at 
the East, for domestic purposes. This part has very litde 
bone and is generally used for choice steaks, and the por- 
tion next the tail, left from the steak cutting, is a choice 
piece for corning. 

No. 7. — The Pin-bo7ie, a choice piece for roasting, being 
very tender. 

No. 8. — The Round, which furnishes common steaks, and 
is the choice cut for dried beef or for corning. 

No. 9. — The Leg, the choice soup piece. 

No. 10. — The Shin, also used for soup. 

No. 1 1. — The Thin flank ^ used for boiling and for corning. 

No. 12. — The Brisket, used for corning. 

No. 13. — The Plate, used for family boiling and for 
corning. 

No. 14. — The Plate (thick end), extending under the 
shoulder, used for corning and family boiling. 

No. 15. — The Breast, or butt end of the brisket, also 
called the " sticking piece." Used for corning and soup-- 
meat. 

If the cutting vary materially from this plan, it is still 
true that the essential parts of the animal continue to exist 
and are for sale under some name and in some shape. A 
polite inquiry of any reputable butcher will secure the 
desired information as to any part. By this means a person 
may secure intelligent skill in purchasing beef Some spe- 
cial points concerning beef need a moment's attention. 

The Tongue is used fresh, salted, or smoked. It is a very 



MARKETING. 



263 



desirable and delicate portion, suitable for table use at almost 
any time. The Tail, which affords some meat and much 
gelatinous substance, is prized for soups, ox-tail soup espe- 
cially being founded upon it. The Heart and Liver are used 
for food — the former being stuffed and roasted, the latter 
being fried, usually with onions. The Tripe, which is the 
lining of the large, or receiving stomach of the beef, is used 
for souse, for pepper-pot, etc. It is a cheap article. The 
Kidneys of beef are sold separate from the sirloin, from 
which they are cut. They are used for stewing, etc. Stiet, 
used for pie-crust, plum-puddings, mince-meat, etc., is the 
solid, clear fat, which incloses the kidney. When pure it 
is a very desirable article. The Feet are used for jellies, 
though not so delicate as the calf's foot. The Head is refuse. 
The Marrow-bones are those of the shin, leg, and round. 
Any of the round, hollow bones contain marrow. The 
other remains of beef are refuse, except as available for 
manufacturing purposes. 

VEAL. 
Veal is a favorite meat. Consult the points concerning it 
made upon page 'j^. Veal is cut as shown below. 

No. I. — Loin, the best end. It is the favorite roasting 
piece, and furnishes the 
choice chops. It com- 
mands the best price. 

No. 2. — i^z7/^^, or cutlet 
piece. This too is a 
choice part, being excel- 
lent for steaks and for 
roasting and filling. It 
is also verv fine for a cold 
cut. 

No. 3. — The Leg, call- 
ed knuckle also, used chiefly fc>r stewing and for soup. 
No. 4. — The Rackf used for chops, and for roasting ; les« 
20

264 THE HOUSEWIFE' S LIBRARY. 

desirable and lower priced than the loin, having more 
bone. 

No. 5.-— The Neck, used for stewing, pies, etc. The best 
end is quite desirable, that nearer the head being of less 
value. 

No. 6. — Head. The brains and tongue are prized by many, 
the former for frying as a deHcacy, the latter for boiling. 
The head, as a whole, is used in mock turtle and some other 
fancy soups. 

No. 7. — The Slioiilder, used for roasting, for which it 
ansv/ers a good purpose. It is valuable for a stew also. 

No. 8. — The Breast. This is the second choice piece for 

stuffing and roasting. It is too valuable for pies, stews, etc 

No. 9. — The Shin. This usually goes with the shoulder, 

with which it is often roasted. If used separately, it answers 

Fairly well for stewing. 

The Sweetbread, a very delicate portion, belongs with the 
oreast. It is often sold separately, however. The Kidneys 
are sold with the loin, in the fat of which they are imbedded. 
The Heart and Liver are great delicacies for frying, or the 
heart for stuffing and roasting. The Feet are the basis of 
genuine calves-foot jelly, and are much prized for this pur- 
pose. The Ejitrails, cut open and well cleaned, are made 
into souse by some persons. 

MUTTON. 
Next to beef, the most profitable and healthful meat is 
mutton. In all markets this meat is cut substantially in the 
Bame manner as shown in the following chart. The names 
ftnd ordinary uses of the parts are as follows : 

No. I. — The Loin, best end. This is the choice piece for 
filling and roasting and for prime chops. Of course, it com- 
mands the best price. 

No. 2. — The Leg. This joint is nearly always used for 
roasting and chops, sometimes also for boiling. It has but 
Uttle bone, as compared with the other parts of tlie animal. 



MARKETING. 265 

and is, therefore, an economical piece to select, though the 
price per pound be greater than that of any other cut. It 
is common to find a good leg weighing from seven to twelve 
pounds. 

No. 3.— The Lobiy second choice. This furnishes " French

chops," a favorite dish in eating-houses, and is specially 
good for a roast. 

No. 4. — The Loin^ rump end. Good for roasting and 
boiling. It contains considerable bone. 

No. 5. — The Shoulder, used for boiling and for filling and 
roasting. It is less in price and nearly as good as the leg, 
but it has more bone. 

No. 6. — The Breast^ used for stews and for meat pies. A 
savory, juicy part. 

No. 7. — The Flank. A continuation of the breast, but 
somewhat thinner. This with the breast makes a cheap 
roast, which may be split and filled. 

No. 8. — The Rack. The best end of the rack is used for 
second-rate chops. The neck end of the rack is good for 
stewing only. 

No. 9. — The Neck. This, with the neck end of the rack, 
is for stewing only, 



266 



THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 



No. 10. — The Head. The tongue only is used, the re 
mainder being refuse. 

It is customary to split mutton down the back, and then 
to split each half into parts called hind and fore quarters. 
The saddle is the middle portion before this quartering is 
done. Part of it goes with each quarter. 

The hind quarter of mutton, consisting of the leg and 
the loin, is the choice quarter. It makes a very superior 
large roast, while either of its parts, the leg or the loin, suf- 
fices nicely for a small company. A hind quarter from an 
animal in good condition will weigh from twenty to thirty 
pounds. The Kidneys are used as in beef, so also the heart 
and liver. The other parts are refuse. 

LAMB. 
Lamb is cut as mutton, but it is usually dressed with 
more care, so as to present a more attractive appearance. 
Lamb proper is in market in the spring only. As the sea^ 
son advances older lamb is in market, but what is called 
"lamb" in the winter months is usually poor mutton 
dressed lamb style. The butcher indulges in a quiet smile 
when his customer, in the winter season, asks for and pays 
for " lamb." Of course, the superiority and rarity of lamb 

demand for it the best 
prices. Indeed, " fancy 
prices " reign in lamb.

When nicely cured it is a very great delicacy. It is a great 
article of commerce also. 

No. 2. — Sirloin, furnishing chops and the finest roast- 
ing pieces. 

No. 3. — Rack, used for second-rate chops and roasts, 
the meat being as sweet, but the bone being greater than in 
the sirloin. 

No. 4. — Neck, used for inferior roasting, and for Koiling 
when fresh, and also for corning. 

No. 5. — The Shoulder. A fair roasting piece, but chiefly 
used, like the ham, for pickling and curing, though it is 
greatly inferior to ham in juiciness and flavor. Either fresh 
or corned it is a fine boiling piece. 

No. 6. — Th^ Jowl. Useful for smoking. Sometimes cured 
with the tongues remaining in them. 

No. 7. — The Head. Used for puddings and head cheese. 

No. 8. — The Belfy or Flilck. A good boiling piece either 
fresh, salted, or smoked. 

No. 9. — Feef. These are much used for souse and for 
pickling. They contain so much gelatinous matter that the/ 
are exceedingly desirable. 

The Ears also are used for souse and head cheese. The 
Liver, Heart, and' Kidneys are used for liver pudding. The 
Entrails, nicely cleaned, are used for sausage skins. The Fat 
about the kidneys furnishes leaf lard. The other fat fur- 
nishes common lard. The other parts are refuse. 

VENISON. 

If the marketer desires venison, it is well to remember 
that buck venison is best from August 1st to November ist^ 
and that doe venison is best from the latter date to January 
1st, after which no deer should be killed. It is quite com- 
mon, however, to .reeze deer meat, and to keep it for montha 
in that state. This adds to the cost, but it also improvei 
the fibre of the meat. 

Venison is cut into parts respectively designated haunch, 



^6S THE HO USE WIPE'S LIBKAR Y. 

saddle, leg, loin, fore-quarter, and steaks. The latter should 
not be cut until ready for use. Venison should be fat. It 
cannot be too fat. Its flavor is better after hanging a few 
days, but it should not become rank. To test this, pierce it 
with a skewer and notice the odor. Shun tough venison. 

For roasting, choose the haunch, the saddle, the neck, or 
the shoulder. Cut steaks from the leg. Stew the shoulder, 
or any part which is too thin for satisfactory roasting. 

POULTRY. 

Tests of poultry are given on page 6i. But the expe- 
dients resorted to in order to mislead purchasers are so 
numerous that even experts are not wholly safe. Techni- 
cally, the term chickens belongs to fowls under a year old, 
but actually, the entire tribe is included in the name. Capons 
are young roosters, gelded and carefully fed so as to secure 
the utmost delicacy of flesh. Pullets are young hens. 

Turkeys reach their maturity in eight or nine months, 
and hence young, but well-grown turkeys, are in market 
about the fall and winter holidays. Young hen turkeys are 
regarded as best, being fatter and more juicy ; but the male 
turkeys will be larger for the same age. The legs of young 
turkeys are black ; of old ones reddish and rough. Young 
cocks have small spurs ; old ones large spurs and very 
rough legs. Fat turkeys, with broad, full breasts, are pre- 
ferable. Soft, pliable feet indicate fresh-killed birds. 

Wild turkeys are deemed to be finer in flavor than tame 
ones. They are in season in November, December, and 
Januar)^ They are usually sold with their feathers on. 
Small birds have their well-defined seasons, as have other 
kinds of game, but they admit little choice except as fresh. 

VEGETABLES. 

Every good marketer will supply his table with a variety 

of vegetables all the year round. There is hardly a vege- 

table that cannot be had in our markets at any season, 

either fresh or canned. Railroads and steamers connect the 



MARKETING. 269 

different climates so closely that one hardly know3 whether 
he is eating fruits and vegetables in or out of their natural 
season. But it takes a long purse to buy fresh vegetables 
at the North while the ground is yet frozen. Still, there are 
so many vegetables that keep through cold weather that if 
we did not have new ones from the South, there would be, 
nevertheless, a variety from which to choose. Late in the 
spring, when the old vegetables begin to shrink and grow 
rank, we greatly appreciate what comes from the South, 

If one has a good, dry cellar, it is wise to procure in the 
fall vegetables enough for all winter. But if the cellar is 
warm, vegetables will sprout and decay before half the cold 
months have passed. Those best adapted for winter keep- 
ing are onions, squashes, turnips, beets, carrots, parsnips, 
cabbages, and potatoes. Squashes and onions should be 
kept in a very dry room. The others will keep readily in a 
cool, dry cellar, or bedded in sand beneath the reach of frost 
If vegetables be bought as needed, care must be used to 
get them in good condition. In season, they should never 
appear wilted, but should be fresh and crisp. At no time 
should they be used if suffering from decay. The utmost 
prudence is needed at this point. A very little waste will 
more than counterbalance all you save by purchasing large 
quantities, and by storing for the winter. 

The luxuries of the world are spread at the feet of the 
customer in our markets ; still, extravagant expenditure is 
by no means necessary. Many delicacies are within the 
reach of all. Those who content themselves with sending to 
the markets, miss many golden opportunities. Those who go, 
see for themselves, and embrace many a favoring chance. 
Personal observation ripens into experience also, and the 
experienced purchasers command the situation. 

These remarks apply with equal force to purchasing of 
the grocer, the baker, the milkman, and all, in short, who 
supply us with the necessaries of life. There are reliable 



270 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY, 

dealers and those of doubtful integrity; but in every case 
the hope of the household is in its provider. Cultivate 
power in this line. 

It is best to deal steadily with persons whom you have 
tried and found reliable. Do not relinquish your indepen- 
dence, so as to suggest to them the idea that they may im- 
pose on you. Be ready to go elsewhere, if the old service 
falls off; but usually those who are regular dealers at a 
place get the best attention, and errors or failures can be 
rectified with ease. 

In all marketing and dealing with storekeepers keep your 
temper. To lose one's temper and scold or threaten, is un- 
dignified and worse than useless. State your grievances 
calmly and plainly. If they are redressed, all right ; if not 
redressed, you can quietly go elsewhere and bestow your 
patronage. A little suspension of trade with a dealer often 
works wonders. He does not want to lose customers ; but 
such is the waywardness of human nature, that all of us 
need reminders to keep us fully up to duty. Let the dealer 
have these when he needs them, but never at the expense 
of your own self-possession aad courteous dignity. 



XXIV.— CARVING. 

THE ART OF CARVING ; REQUISITES ; CARVING TURKEY, CHICKEN, 
DUCKS, GEESE, SMALL BIRDS, BEEF, MUTTON, LAMB, VENISON, 
HAM, PIG,. RABBIT, STEAKS, FISH, TONGUE, AND CALF'S-HEAD. 

I ^ VERY person who travels or visits much sees number- 
"^ less illustrations of the varied capacities of carvers. 
Hotel and restaurant life does not make much display 
in this line, as the carving is done out of sight. And yet 
even here the marvelous thinness of the slice, which is so 
immense in its area, demonstrates that somebody is on hand 
who is expert in this line. In private houses the meat and 
the poultry are sometimes carved before they come to the 
table. Bv whom done, or with \\hat accompaniments of per- 
spiration and emphatic words, the guests know not. But 
meat served thus is chilled and juiceless, and generally dam- 
aged. It is worthy of better treatment. 

Many amusing and not a few irritating examples of 
clumsy carving occur under everybody's eyes. Meat is con- 
demned as tough, knives as dull, dishes as too small, there 
is too much gravy, skewers are not drawn, and a thousand 
other reasons are blurted out by the clumsy carver, as he 
outwardly sweats and inwardly swears at his task. He slops 
gravy on to the cloth ; he drops part of the meat from the 
dish ; he cuts himself by an unfortunate slip of the knife ; 
and sometimes, like a distinguished v/it of whom the story 
tells, he lands a fowl in the lap of a lady beside him, 
though probably, unlike that wit, he will not have the grace 
to say, " I will thank you, madam, to return that chicken." 

Ever}' housekeeper should learn to carve. Carving should 
be done^t the table by the gentleman of the house, or, in his 



272 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

absence, by the lady, unless some other of the family be an 
expert carver. Unless a guest Is known to be an expert, or 
unless he volunteers for the duty, he should not be expected 
to carve. He may be a clumsy hand, and the courtesy of 
hospitality should protect him from exposure at this point. 
J The carver at a private table should retain his seat while 
carving and serving. To facilitate this,, his chair should be 
high, so that he can reach readily to his work. The dish 
should be large enough to prevent soiling the cloth, except 
by some unusual accident. The centre of a carving-dish for 
roast meats should be raised nearly as high as the surround- 
ing edge, so that a horizontal movement of the knife in slicing 
may be made without interference from the edges. No man 
can slice meat neatly if the meat is in the bottom of a deep 
dish, into which he must scoop with his knife as best he 
may. Elevate the meat, but have a surrounding depression 
between the centre and the edge, where the rich juices of the 
meat may accumulate, and where they may be served readily. 

Not all knives are suitable for carving, nor is any one knife 
just the thing for all work in this line. For slicing, a long, 
thin, broad blade is essential. With a fine roast, elevated on 
the dish, and with a good, sharp slicing knife in hand, a 
■tool-headed man can hardly help doing neat and rapid work. 

But such a knife is not the one for poultry or rib carving. 
For these uses a shorter blade, which is both narrower and 
stififer, must be employed. All knives for carving must be 
sharp. There should be a good steel at hand to touch up 
the edge — nothing more, for a dull knife should be ground, 
or whet up on an oil-stone. Any large fork, with a guard 
to prevent accidents, -will do. A rest for the knife and fork 
when not in use is desirable. The carver's requisites, there- 
fore, are as follows : A high chair, suitable serving plates, 
two sharp knives, a good fork, and a knife and fork rest 
With these he is ready for work. Without them he is at 
serious disadvantage. ^ 




CARVING. 273 

Carvilig a TiU'kev. — Nothing- delights an expert carver 
more than the opportunity to cut up a fine roast turkey. 
Such a man is in doubt whether the eating of the meat even 
is the greater luxury. 

Whether the head of the bird shall lie to the carver'*; 
right or left is an open question. Better to the right, as 
more work is required on the head end, and in this position 
the knife-hand works less over the hand which holds the 
fork. 

The fork should be inserted astride of the breast-bone, 
just back of its most promi- 
nent point. It should be 
sunk deep enough to pene- 
trate the encasing bone be- 
low the white meat. This 
secures full command of the 

bird. If the company be turkey properly trussed for 
small and the bird fairly roasting. 

large, better do all the cutting from one side, reserving the 
other in as perfect a form as possible. 

Remove all the limbs first unless half the bird is to be 
reserved. The neat cut is to remove each drum-stick, or 
lower leg, by a single stroke of the knife, which must ex- 
actly hit the joint. To remove the thigh, or upper leg 
joint, make a V-shaped cut, wide enough at the point whence 
the drum-stick has been cut to include all the meat, but 
converging at the joint, which can always be distinctly seen 
near the back. Two strokes of the knife do this work, each 
of them cutting down to the carcase. A slight outward 
pressure of the knife-blade, applied between the carcase and 
the upper point of the thigh joint, will cause it to drop 
off neatly on the plate. Outside the lines of these cuts, flakes 
of dark meat will remain adhering to the carcase, which 
should now be cut off. They help to meet demands for 
d^'k meat. 



274 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

In carving the wings, the neat stroke removes the lower 
part, which contains the two bones, by cutting at the inner 
part of the joint, and so turning the blade of the knife as 
to throw that part off in the direction opposite to its natural 
movement. The first joint of each wing then follows, the 
cut being deep enough to fully reach the ball and socket 
joint. A slight motion of the pinion toward the head of the 
bird will suffice usually to detach this part. If it does not, 
the point of the knife may be thrust into the socket of the 
joint to sever the cartilage. This will free it. 

When this dismembering is accomplished, proceed to 
slice the breast meat in thin, broad slices. Clean off all the 
white meat, unless part only is needed. Placing your knife 
close to the front of the breast-bone, and cutting toward the 
neck, you will dislodge the V-shaped bone, corresponding 
to the " merrythought " or '' pull-bone " of chickens. To 
dislodge the collar-bones is to many a hard task. But cut 
the cartilages which bind them to the frame of the bird. 
These cartilages are in the cavity between the neck and the 
breast-bone. Through this cavity, thrust your knife out- 
wardly under one of these bones ; make a fulcrum of the 
front part of breast-bone, and a lever of the knife, its edge 
resting on the fulcrum. You can then easily pry up the 
troublesome bone and turn it off to the side. This move- 
ment takes the bone at the best mechanical advantage. It 
must come, and come at once, if this movement be made. 

Now attend to the other end of the bird. Shave off all 
superfluous meat from the carcase. Turn the carcase on its 
side, the back toward you. Insert your knife beside the oil- 
bag and thrust it forward parallel to the spine. It will cut 
its way vo-vy easily. A slight outward movement of the 
knife will then throw off these side bones, which are choice 
pieces, yielding the juiciest of the dark meat. The ribs 
may now be cut through with ease from front to rear, about 
midway from breast to back. The breast-bone is incapable 




CARVING, 275 

of further division, but the back easily divides into six parts. 
Turn it back up and hold with the fork ; separate the oil- 
bag, about an inch of the spine with it ; lift the 
projecting spine with the knife back and it will 
break readily, carrying one rib with it. Cut off 
from each side of the remaining spine the rib 
parts adherent to it; then divide the remaining 
spine just back of the neck. 

An entire drum-stick, or second joint, need not 
be served to any one person, but had better be 
divided among several. A fair-sized turkey 
divided on the above method will furnish a good 
supply for twenty people. 

It will be asked, however, how can one become ^^' ^' ^'^^ , 

' ' easy break- 

SO expert in hitting these joints? Frequently age. a,c,e. 
the carver tries, and tries again, but tries in vain, fj"^^ J^ ^Jp^^ 
to strike the right place for his knife. There is rationofside- 
one way only to succeed in this art. The anatomy ^^^^ rib por' 
of the turkey or chicken, or any other animal, must ''°°- 
be carefully studied. Do it in this way. Whenever a tur- 
key is brought into your house and is made ready for the 
roasting, place it on its back, as it will lie on the plate when 
it comes to the table. Carefully manipulate it, and note 
exactly where every joint lies. Imagine yourself about to 
carve it. Where would you put the knife to throw off that 
drum-stick ? How would you cut to throw off the thigh 
bone. Read the preceding directions ; apply them in fancy 
to the bird as you see and handle it ; then carry it all out at 
the table when the bird is cooked. 

No surgeon could do his work except he had thus prac- 
ticed on actual subjects in dissection. He must know by 
actual trial just what to do and how to do it. So must the 
carver know. Chickens, ducks, geese, small birds, meat, 
roasting pigs, every article, in short, which he expects to carve 
oaust be understood beforehand; then success will be his.

Caxving Roast Chicken. — The same course precisely as has 
been prescribed for carving turkey must 
be followed with chickens. The only 
difference is in the formation of the 
*' pull-bone " or " merrythought," but 
this makes no difference whatever in the 
cutting of the bird. 



Camng Roast Dncks and Geese. — These 
are more difficult than turkey or chick- 
ens, for the reason that they are constitu- 
tionally more sinewy in the joints and 
they have far less flesh proportionately.

They are barrel-shaped, 
with thin layers of meat 
instead of the fine 
masses of flesh found 
on the turkey or on fine 
chickens. The leg joints 
lie farther to the rear, 
and higher on the side 
than in land fowls. They are not so easily reached, therefore

Other dishes, and so to be served lightly. Goose is some- 
times the main piece, but not often so at elaborate feasts. 

Carviag Broiled CMckens. — Chickens for broiling are pre- 
sumably young and tender. If not, thorough steaming before 
they are broiled will do something for them. They are 
trussed in such shape usually that joints are not easily 
struck. But study the bird when trussed. See where joints 
do lie and cut them. If the birds are really young and ten- 
der, however, they may be halved or quartered, cutting 
through the bones directly and so serving them. 

Carving Smaller Birds. — Smaller 
birds which need carving, may 
simply be split longitudinally, just 
beside the breast-bone and the 
spine. Their bones can be cut 
easily. This will apply to pigeon, 
partridge, prairie hen, pheasant, smaller bird PROPERLir

etc. 

Carving Roast Beef — Pieces of roast beef vary so that no 
one rule covers all. A safe general direction, however^ is 
to study carefully just what is in the piece before it is 
cooked. Know your meat before you attempt to carve it. 
Another general rule, applicable to all meats indeed, is to 
cut across the grain in all cases. Meat cut with the grain 
is stringy and fibrous. If cut across the grain, all the longi- 
tudinal flakes of flesh and the minute sinews are cut so 
short that any toughness existing in them is wholly con- 
cealed. The first slice, by this process, will always be a 
brown, outside cut. Slices should always be thin, but not 
so as to seem ragged. In carving ribs of beef the knife 
may be thrust along close to the ribs, so as to separate the 
meat from them. The cuts then made across the grain will 
separate the slices with ease and neatness. Never cut beef 
across the bone. It is the easiest way, but also the poorest. 



278 



THE HOUSEWIFE' S LIBRARY. 



Camng Rcasts of Mutton. — A leg of mutton is carved as a 
ham, by cutting down to the bone, from the outer edge, 
making the cuts converge on the bone, so freeing each sHce 
as it is cut. 

A shoulder of mutton should be carved as the lee. In 
each case, when the choice cuts are exhausted, clip off the 
remaining meat as best you can, always across the grain. 

Saddle of mutton is carved in several ways: ist, in longi- 
tudinal slices along the backbone ; 2d, by transverse slices, 
each taking in a rib, which makes thick and clumsy por- 
tions ; 3d, by oblique slices, not taking in the bones, but 
forming a slight angle with them. The latter method is 
deemed preferable by most carvers. 

In all roasts which include the ribs the backbone should 

be well and cleanly cut through by the butcher, between every 

pair of ribs. Otherwise no satisfactory carving can be done. 

Carving Roasts of Lamb. — The cut shows a fore-quarter of 

lamb with its outer side uppermost. This joint is first to 

be cut so as to divide the 
shoulder from the rest ol 
the quarter, which is called 
the target. For this pur- 
pose, put the fork firmly 
into the shoulder joint, and 
then cut underneath the 
blade-bone, beginning at a, 
FORI^QUARTER OF LAMB. ^^d continue Cutting all 

around in the direction of the circular line, and pretty close 
to the under part of the blade-bone. Some cut the shoulder 
large, while others take off no more meat with it than is 
barely necessary to remove the blade-bone. It is most con- 
venient to place the shoulder on a separate dish. This is 
carved in the same way as the shoulder of mutton. When 
the shoulder Is removed, a lemon may be squeezed over 
fhat part of the remainder of the joint where the knife has. 




CAR VING.

passed ; this gives a flavor to the meat which is generally 
approved. Then proceed to cut completely through from 
b to c, following the line across the bones as cracked by the 
butcher, and this will divide the ribs (d) from the brisket {e). 
Tastes vary in giving preference to the ribs or the brisket. 

Other parts of lamb are carved as mutton. The fat is 
very delicate and should be served to all the guests. 

Caxving Roasts of Venison. — These resemble roasts of 
mutton so closely that no different directions for their carv- 
ing need be given. 

Carving Ham. — Boiled or baked ham may be served either 
side up. The inner edge of the ham, which lay adjacent to 
the body, is rather more tender than the edge, which lay 
toward the tail. Slices should be cut directly from the edge 
to the bone, cutting out the middle portions first. Let the 
cuts converge upon the bone every time, so that each slice 
is set free at once. When the choice cuts are gone, trim up 
the remaining parts neatly as possible, and always across 
the grain. The knuckle end of a ham furnishes the leaner 
and drier cuts. Some prefer carving hams with a more 
slanting cut, rather than a direct, right-angled cut upon the 
bone, beginning at the thick end, and so continuing through^ 
out. This mode is, however, apt to be very wasteful, unless 
the carver be careful to take away both fat and lean in due 
proportion. 

Carving Roast Pig. — The cut below represents a pig roasted 
whole and served in the most 
approved style. Many, how- 
ever, separate the head before 
serving, and garnish the body 
with the ears, jaw, etc. The 
head may be severed by a 
neat cut around the neck, and a little sideward motion, but 
this is not rieccssary, as the cheek or jaw can be removed 
21

without removing the head. The shoulder should then be 
taken off from the body, by passing the knife under it in a 
circular direction, and the leg separated as shown in the 
line d, e,f. The ribs may then be divided into two or more 
parts, helping at the same time an ear or jaw with it, with 
some of the sauce also. Pieces may be cut from the legs 
and shoulders. Some consider the neck end the finest part, 
while others give the ribs the preference. 

Carviiig Roast Rabbit. — Begin by cutting longitudinally 
from head to tail near to the backbone, then make a corres- 
ponding cut on the other side of the backbone, leaving the 
back and the head in one distinct piece. Cut off the legs 
at the hip-joint, and take off the wing, or fore leg, nearly as 
you would the wing of a bird, carrying the knife round in a 

circular line. The ribs 
are of little importance, 
as they are bare of meat. 
Divide the back into 
three or four equal por- 
tions. The head is then 
to be cut off, and the 
lower jaw divided from

by epicures. The comparative goodness of different parts 
of a rabbit will depend much on the age, and also upon 
the cooking. The back and the legs are always the best 
parts. 




XXV.— SERVING MEALS. 

METHODS OF SERVING MEALS; RUSSIAN, ENGLISH, FRENCH, AND 
AMERICAN STYLES ; TABLES, TABLE-CLOTHS, NAPKINS, AND 
DECORATIONS ; FINGER-BOWLS ; DUE CEREMONY ; WHAT TO 
avoid; GARNISHES; ROYAL DISPLAYS. 

METHODS of serving meais differ widely. The items 
of conveniences and pecuniary ability always become 
important elements in the case. Taste, too, enters 
largely into it. 

Square end tables are now the proper style. They should 
be sufficiently roomy to wholly avoid crowding. A spot- 
lessly white table-cloth should be spread, with padding 
under it to deaden sound and make a softer appearance. 
The cloth should not be very stiffly starched, but it should 
be nicely polished and beautifully glossy. It should hang 
two feet from the top edge, the corners gathered up, if needs 
be, to prevent their drooping on the floor. Napkins should 
be large and heavy. Such texture does not need much 
starch. The glass and silverware should be perfect in 
brightness. It may be of inexpensive kind, but it must be 
scrupulously clean. 

Colored table-cloths of ornamental patterns are allowable 
for luncheon or tea. They are not in place where hot meats 
are sensed. Nor are colored napkins. Too often these 
deep tinted articles are used "to save washing," which 
means " to conceal dirt." Not unfrequently covers and nap- 
kins of this kind are kept in use when their rank odor cries 
out for the wash-tub, even though their soiled appearance 
does not. The doily, or U Oiley, as some will have it from 
the proper name of its first reputed maker, is a small, colored 
napkin used with fruits and wines. Stains will not show so 
readily upon these, but they must always be scrupulously 
fresh and clean. To conceal filth under rich coloring is 
sacrilege of the worst sort, but to bring it to the table, and 
ask guests to wipe their lips with it, is a crime. 



282 THE HOUSEWIFE' S LIBRARY. 

A great variety of ornaments and adornments are admia* 
sible on a table, but nothing is so pure and so appropriate 
as a handsome display of ferns or flowers. The flowers 
should not be just such as ladies wear so profusely and so 
beautifully in their belts and on their dresses. Larger blooms 
are preferable for the table, especially those of the pure white 
and fine texture belonging to the lily family. 

It is quite the proper and beautiful thing to place a neat 
bouquet beside each plate, in tasteful bouquet-holders. For 
gentlemen the little bunching suitable for the button-hole is 
desirable. For ladies the belt bouquet will meet the case. 
The floral centre-piece may be composed of small bouquets, 
which at the end of the meal may be distributed. 

Fruit pieces and handsome confectionery pieces may be 
disposed to advantage in ornamenting the table. Tasty 
folding of spotless napkins is so important a decoration that 
the subject will be treated fully farther on. These may be 
perched in polished goblets, while bouquets, or small rolls 
of bread nestle amid their snowy folds. Little arts like 
these embellish a table, and delight the guests. 

But these embellishments must not be overdone. What 
will be correct for a large table will be too much for a small 
one, and what will be just right for a small table will look 
thin and meagre on a large one. Study the proprieties of 
every occasion. What suits once does not suit forever. 

Embellishments may be liberally bestowed upon the din- 
ing-room itself In addition to its permanent decorations, 
flowers are always admissible. At the great ball on March 
20th, 1883, at the Vanderbilt Mansion in New York, the 
decorations of the supper-room were absolutely regal. The 
walls were completely hidden with palms and ferns, from 
which a countless number of orchids were suspended. Two 
large fountains were introduced into the far corners of the 
room. The doors of the main entrance to the supper-room 
were in an ooen position and were completely covered with 



SEFVIXG MEALS. 283 

roses and lilies of the vallc}'. In the centre of the room a 
large palm towered almost to the ceiling, and about it from 
the dome was suspended an immense Bougen Villa vine, the 
tendrils of which drooped in bunches from the branches of 
the palm. Throughout the room there were many stands 
and vases filled with flowers, the entire effect more 
resembling fairyland than an earthly home. Few can rival 
such a display, of course, but all enjoy at least a pen-peep 
upon such princely splendor. 

No ornament should be so large as to obscure to any 
great extent a view of the entire table, or to conceal any of 
its guests. As many knives, forks, and spoons as will be 
needed for the various courses may be placed at each plate, 
though, to avoid the display of so much cutlery, a better 
style is to supply these accessories as needed. Goblets and 
wine-glasses, if the latter be used, should be on the table at 
the start. Large spoons, with salt and pepper casters, 
.should be on the table also. The dessert-plates, finger- 
bowls, etc., should stand ready on the sideboard, awaiting 
the time when they shall be needed. The hot closet should 
be well stocked with dishes needing to be used warm. 

Finger-bowls should be half filled with water. In Paris they 
are served with warm water scented with peppermint. A 
slice of lemon in cold water answers the purpose entirely, as 
it removes any grease fi'om fingers or lips. A geranium 
leaf may tloe^t in the water. Its fragrance on the fi^ngers, if 
it be pressed, will be agreeable. It is customary to place a 
fruit napkin, or doily, on the dish on which the finger-bowl 
rests, to avoid the rattle of the bowl, and to protect the dish 
from injury if it be highly ornamented. Little openworked 
mats will, however, answer better. Do not summon your 
company to dinner by a bell. Country hotels and cheap 
boarding-houses may do that, but not a refined home, espe- 
cially when guests are present. 

Soup is dished by the lady of the house at a home dinner. 



284 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Meat is cut and dished by the gentleman of the house; 
Vegetables, bread, butter, water, etc., are sen/ed by the 
waiter, dessert by the hostess, except in the case of melons, 
requiring to be cut at the table, which is the work of the 
host. 

Home meals should all be sufficiently ceremonious to 
dispense with haste and confusion. On the other hand, they 
should not run into stiffness and frigidity. Bright, cheer)% 
pleasant chat should enliven every meal. If the leading dish 
be nothing but hash, let it be served in good style and amid 
a profusion of genial, social sunshine. 

What to Avoid. 

1st. — Never use table-linen which is open to the suspicion 
of being soiled. The napkin-ring business is of question- 
able propriety. Why not, as at hotels, furnish a clean nap- 
kin to each person at every meal ? 

2d. — Crockery with an abundance of nicks and splints 
and cracks is not unsightly merely, but, where the glazing 
is broken, the porous material absorbs grease and dish water, 
making these spots dense with unsavory and unwholesome 
matter. 

3d. — Partly emptied dishes become unsightly, and some- 
times positively repulsive. They look like refuse and scraps. 
At the great State dinners at the Tuileries, no guest saw a 
partly emptied dish. A full, beautifully garnished dish was 
presented for his approval, upon expressing which, his per- 
sonal plate was taken to a side table and supplied from 
another serving dish. 

4th. — An overloaded tab'ie or plate satiates appetite 
rather than stimulates it. A gracious expectancy of what 
is to come is a great help at the table. 

5th. — A stinted supply is very discoiiraging. To the ap^ 
prehension of a lack of food, the moral sense of mortification 
vs added in this case. 



SERVING MEALS. 285 

6th. — Beware of ill-assorted dinners or tea-parties. An 
occasion intended to be a pleasure is often a pest for lack of 
care in this regard. This caution applies to the selection of 
guests, and more strongly to the disposition of guests at the 
table. Secure fitness both in the viands presented and in 
the parties present. 

/th. — Do not inaugurate new features at a dinner party, 
unless you are sure you have the mastery of them, and that 
when done in a masterly way they will certainly prove 
agreeable. 

8th. — Beware of the delusion that hospitality is expressed 
by the weight of its beef and mutton, and the multitude and 
rarity of its viands. 

9th. — Have no meddlesome, noisy, or slovenly service 
Waiters should be attired neatly, and should wear light 
shoes or slippers. They should take no part in the social 
proceedings, not so much, indeed, as to smile at the best 
things. On formal occasions the man-servant should wear 
a dress-coat, white vest, and white necktie. The maid- 
servant should be attired In a neat, inconspicuous dress, 
with spotless white apron. 

lOth. — Both haste and slowness should be shunned. At 
the finished French dinners, the courses will not average 
vnore than five minutes each. French waiters are marvel- 
ously expert, however, in removing and replacing dishes. 

Garnishes. 

Much of the attractiveness of a table depends on the 
garnishes, which arc added to certain dishes to embellish or 
beautify them. A few hints on this subject will be of value. 

Parsley is the almost universal garnish to all kinds of 
cold meat, poultry, fish, butter, cheese, etc. 

Horse-radish is the garnish for roast beef, and for fish in 
g-eneral ; for the latter, slices of lemon are sometimes laid 
alternately with heaps of horse-radish.
