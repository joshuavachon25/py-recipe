PREFACE 



THERE are many valuable works written on the general 
subject of bacteriology, but nearly all such text-books 
apply the science either directly or indirectly to the field 
of medicine and surgery. Few authors have given any 
considerable space to the study of non-pathogenic bacteria, and 
very little attempt has been made to describe these species, beyond 
a few typical forms mentioned by the old authors. 

While the pathogenic bacteria are occasionally found associated 
with the spoilage of food products, the non-pathogenic bacteria are 
far more common. Some of the pathogenic bacteria produce pto- 
maines and toxins in various food products, having gained entrance 
through contamination with diseased persons and animals, but these 
cases are extremely rare, owing to the rigid inspection of such 
products as are most liable to infection. Putrefactive bacteria are 
more commonly active agents in the production of ptomaines. 

In this work we have endeavored to outline a course of study 
in bacteriology which will be particularly useful to the manufac- 
turer and the student of food products. The causes of spoilage are 
defined, and the first volume is designed particularly to enable the 
student to gain a general knowledge of bacteriology which may be 
applied directly to solving problems of spoilage. 

In the general plan have been introduced various well-known 
species of bacteria for comparative study, because the descriptions 
are given fully in nearly all text-books and the beginner will be 
better fitted for isolating and studying new species after he has com- 
pleted a study of the well-known species. 

There has been no attempt to classify or name many of the 
new species which were found associated with food spoilage, but 
the author has been satisfied to describe the action of these species 
on various food substances and has endeavored to ascertain the heat- 
resisting power of various spores. 

The first volume of this work is designed especially to assist 
the student in a laboratory course in bacteriology applied to the 
manufacture of food products, particularly Canning and Preserv- 
ing. The half-tones introduced as illustrations were made from 
photomicrographs taken by the author from specimens, stained and 
mounted, which were either isolated directly from spoiled food 
products or obtained through the courtesy of co-workers. 

Several cultures of pathogenic bacteria were kindly furnished 
by Dr. F. G. Novy of the University of Michigan, and these were 



8 PREFACE 

Stained, mounted and photomicrographed for illustrations in this 
book. 

Chemical methods of analysis have been introduced for the 
benefit of the student. Some of these tests are very useful in the 
study of the products of fermentation and putrefaction. Other 
tests are given for the detection of adulterations and preservatives, 
all necessary for the study of food products. 

In the beginning is a description of the microscope, lenses, ap- 
paratus, etc., employed in different parts of the work, together with 
a complete table of reagents used in the various preparations and 
chemical tests. 

Then follows the description and classification of bacteria and 
methods of cultivating and staining. The method given for stain- 
ing flagella is that employed by the author, with success. The 
various forms of decomposition are carefully studied, the last of 
which is the study of Putrefactive and Pathogenic organisms and 
the poisonous products elaborated by them. 

Sterilization has been carefully studied in all its bearings, in- 
cluding Cleanly Methods of Manufacture and the Disposition of 
Waste Material. 

Considerable space is devoted to the subject of Preservatives ; 
their natural origin ; their formation in canned goods during sterili- 
zation. This subject has been studied by the author and his assis- 
tants by feeding various animals stated daily amounts in their food 
for different periods of time. The feeding terms, weights and path- 
ological effects on the internal organs, are faithfully described. Var- 
ious theories of physicians and authorities of the harmful effect of 
these substances and their effect on processes of digestion have been 
analyzed. Many of these theories have been completely upset by 
actual tests and by force of argument. Throughout the whole 
subject, the author has been faithful to facts as he found them, and 
mere theories without the support of actual experiments and proofs 
have been criticised. 

Whatever may be true as to the effect of at least two preser- 
vatives upon the human organism, no proofs of their harmful ness 
have been produced, — the preservatives studied in this connection are 
Salicylic and Benzoic Acids. 

So far as I know, no person has come forward with the state- 
ment that he has ever been harmed in the least bv eating" them in 
table luxuries. The fact that thousands of tons of these two pre- 
serv'atives have been used by people who w^ere under actual observa- 
tion of the manufacturers, and the fact that no experiments with 
animals have produced pathological changes, seems to indicate that 
much of the hue and cry against them is not well founded. 



PREFACE 9 

Methods are given for extracting varous preservatives; also 
artificial sweeteners; also Miguel's table of Antiseptics and their 
value. 

Artificial colors are not approved, and methods for detecting 
them are given. 

The last part of this volume is taken up with the study of the 
canning of peas, tomatoes and corn. For twenty years the author 
has had practical experience in canning and preserving, having had 
charge of these departments for two of the largest houses in Ameri- 
ca, so that the practical and the scientific knowledge of his subject 
are brought closely together. 

Considerable space has been devoted to the results obtained by 
bacteriological and chemical analyses of various spoilage cases to- 
gether with suggestions made to correct imperfect methods. 

Some laboratory work on tin plate is reproduced. The author 
has endeavored to show the action of fruits and vegetables on tin 
plate. Quantitative analyses of new tin plate were made, and the 
half-tones illustrate the imperfections as they appear on the ordinary 
plate used for canning purposes. 

While this volume does not take in the whole list of canned 
and manufactured food products, in another valume the data at 
hand and the results obtained from the investigation conducted dur- 
ing the coming year will be published.

Table of Reagents. 

THE MICROSCOPE. 

THE MICROSCOPE is the most useful instrument needed for 
this work, and its selection is important in order to get the best pos- 
sible combination of good qualities. No. lo stand, objectives, and 
other attachments made by the Spencer Lens Company, of Buffalo, 
N. Y., give excellent satisfaction. The microscope requires care- 
ful attention ; it should always be kept in a tidy condition, and it is 
quite necessary to know how to take care of the instrument in order 
that its delicate parts may not be injured. The stand shown in the 
cut has a handle, by means of which it may be carried, but most mi- 
croscopes do not have this convenience and they must be lifted by the 
pillar below the level of the stage, and never by the fine adjustment 
tube or by the barrel. The lacquer of a microscope is injured by 
finger marks and should not be touched. Finger marks may be re- 
moved by breathing on the parts and gently rubbing with chamois 
skin. No chemical, such as alcohol or xylol, should be used to re- 
move the marks, because it may remove the lacquer also. The mi- 
croscope is provided with milled parts, which are the only parts to be 
handled when working. 

The stage of the microscope should be kept clean and free from 
water. During the examination of live cultures of bacteria it may 
happen that some of the culture will get on the stage. It should be 
carefully removed with a rag moistened with bichloride of mercury 
solution. 

OBJECTIVES. 

The objectives are of two kinds, the dry and the oil immersion. 
The dry objectives should be kept clean with dry lens paper; they 
should never be allowed to touch oil, water or other substances. 
The oil immersion lens is very delicate and easily injured. It should 



12 CANNING AND PRESERVING OP FOOD PRODUCTS. 

never be used dry, but always with a drop of cedar oil. and in the 
manii)ulation it should never be forced down against the glass slide 
or cover glass. Each evening after work the cedar oil should be re- 
moved from this objective by means of lens paper, moistened with 
xylol and dried with soft linen or lens paper. Alcohol or other 
chemicals should never be used for fear of dissolving the cement 
which holds the lens. 

STANDS. 

The selection of a stand is important, and while it may not be 
expensive it should be strong and firm in all its bearings. If pho- 
tomicrographs arc to be taken, the stability of the stand must be 




first-class. The Hiie adjustment is important. One cannot realize 
this until he begins to take photomicrographs. Many of the fine 
adjustment schemes are very unreliable and are easily jarred out of 
focus, particularly when the microscope is in a horizontal position. 
There is a new fine adjustment which is operated by a cone. This 
is so sensitive that the definitions of the reading drum, mark a ver- 
tical movement of the tulie of 0.002 millimeters. This is a great 
advantage and i^ appreciated by the operator when making photomi- 
cro^aphs. 



THE LABORATORY AND ITS EQUIPMENT. 13 

MECHANICAL STAGE. 

A MECHANICAL STAGE is very useful and almost indis- 
pensable. The one shown in the cut gives an extended lateral move- 



Fig. 2. Mechanical Suge 

ment and the verniers are graded to read o.i m. m., and are placed 
closely together so as to be read at a glance. The mechanical stage 
has the advantage of holding in a steady position a particularly in- 
teresting view. It is also valuable in searching the field, which can 
be done systematically and with great precision. 

OBJECTIVES. 

OBJECTIVES are of two kinds, the dry and the oil. The 
dry objectives are seldom made in powers higher than % inch. For 
fine work, the apochromatic objectives are preferable to any others 
on account of their greatly superior correction of spherical and 
chromatic aberrations, which gives fine definition. The resolving 
power is also greater than the achromatic on account of their higher 
numerical aperture, but for ordinary work the achromatic objectives 
answer very well. 



14 THE LABORATORY AND ITS EQUIPMENT. 

MICROMETER EYEPIECE. 

For measuring objects under the objective it is advisable to 
use both the micrometer eyepiece and stage micrometer.

DESCRIPTION OK LENSES. 



Lenses are of two kinds, simple and compound; the former 
is generally a single lens. A simple microscope is therefore a 
simple lens. The rays of light come directly from the object to 
the eye and a Virtual Image is produced. (See figure 4, by Carpen- 
ter.) This illustrates the simple microscope. 




FiK- 4. Virtual Image, Simple Microacope (Carpenter) 



The object is placed between the focus and the lens. This 
figure also illustrates the action of the eyepiece in the compoimd 
microscope. If the object is placed beyond the principal focus (p) 
a real image results, as is shown in figure 5. This illustrates the 
action of the objective in the compound microscope. In the com- 
pound miscroscope there are two sets of lenses, the eyepiece and 
the objective; the latter is nearest the object and produces a real

image, as shown in figure. The image, however, is inverted and 
reversed ; the light is inside the principal focus of the eyepiece and 
rays of light leave it if they come from a real object. The image

lying inside of the principal focus becomes magnified by the eye- 
piece (e) and the Virtual Image (c d) is produced. 

Roger Bacon, an English monk, is said to have been the first 
man to recognize the peculiar properties of a lens, in 1276. The 
simple lens was used in the construction of spectacles. In the 
seventeenth century the microscope was perfected sufficiently to 
discern bacteria. Galileo made a compound microscope in the year 
1 610, and a cut of this microscope is shown, by Carpenter. This 
microscope contained a single lens for an objective and a single 
lens for an eyepiece. The rays from the single lens do not meet 
in the same plane and spherical aberration results. The rays of 
light are also decomposed in a simple lens, which acts as a prism ; 
the violet is bent most and is brought to a focus at a different 
point from the red ray, which is bent the least. A fringe of colors 
results, and this is designated as "chromatic aberration". The 
spherical chromatic aberrations are corrected in the best instru- 
ments now made by means of diaphragms and stops and combina- 
tions of different kinds of glass. The chromatic aberration is fair- 
ly well corrected by the combination of the two glasses. Crown 
and Flint, and the objectives made from this combination are called 
Achromatic. Still, in the achromatic objective there is not absolute 
freedom from color. Even if some of the rays are neutralized, 
another will remain, and a certain amount of color w^ill show in 
the image in the achromatic objective. This is designated as **sec- 
ondary spectrum." In order to overcome this color. Abbe and 
Zeiss in 1889, prepared special kinds of glass, the so-called "borate" 
and "phosphate" glass, and this combination in objectives was 
designated as "apochromatic." Fluorite is also used in some apo- 
chromatics and the secondary spectrum is thus corrected. This 
correction is disturbed somewhat by the cover-glass, which re- 
fracts the peripheral rays as they enter the objective and they seem 
to come from a point nearer the objective than do the central rays. 
In order to overcome this the objectives are made "under-correct- 
ed," so that both points are focused at once. In order to get uni- 
form results it is well to use cover-glasses of uniform thickness for 
the oil immersion objectives. 

The most important part of the microscope, therefore, is the 
objective, and great care should be exercised in making a selection 
in order to get the best results. While good magnifying power 
is always desirable, it is of less value than the defining, resolving 
and penetrating power. A proper magnifywg pozver is necessary, 
and it is customary to speak of an objective as a ^, J^, 5^, j^, 
1-12, etc. Some makers use these figures, others use letters, and 
some designate the magnifying power by millimeters. Every ob- 
jective has what is called an initial magnification, and this initial 
magnification is multiplied by the magnifying power of the eye- 



THE LABORATORY AND ITS EQUIPME3NT. 17 

piece used. For instance, if the initial magnifying of a 1-12 ob- 
jective is 125, when a No. 8 eyepiece is used, the magnification 
will be 1,000 diameters. Magnification is always meant as linear 
in scientific work, magnification being expressed as so many di- 
ameters. For instance, if a magnification is expressed as 1,000 
diameters, the superficial area magnification would be 1,000,000. 

THE DEFINING POWER. 

It is difficult to secure perfect flatness of field. This is over- 
come to some extent by compensating eyepieces. Flatness of field 
is very essential in making photomicrographs. Probably the most 
important qualities of the microscope are its resolving and pene- 
trating power. These are the qualities which show up the fine 
markings and delicate structures. These qualities have no refer- 
ence to the magnifying power. The light which enters the ob- 
jective has much to do with its resolving power. 




Fig. 7 

Arrangement of Lenses in a 2 millimeter or ^V Oil Immersion Objective (Carpenter) 

A — Angle of Aperture 

The light which enters the objective is included between the 
extreme rays, and an angle is formed by the extreme rays with 
the object in focus, and this angle is known as the "angle of aper- 
ture," shown by (a) in Fig. 7. Fig. 7 shows the system of lenses 
as they are arranged in the oil immersion objective. On account 
of the number of lenses employed, tlie light becomes very faint, and 
it is therefore necessary to admit as much light as possible. The 
improvement of an oil immersion lens over a dry objective is due 
to the fact that the light passing from the oI)ject in focus into the 
cover-glass is somewhat refracted, and unless it is collected again 
much of it is lost. Amici introduced the water immersion objec- 
tive. This was an improvement over the dry objective from the 
fact that water would collect the rays of light fairly well, but in 
1878 Stephenson suggested cedar oil, which has the same index of 
refraction as crown glass, and this has been in use ever since. A 



18 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PROOUCTS. 

high numerical aperture is then most vahiable and objectives thus 
constructed are the most expensive. 

The penetrating pozi-er of an objective depends upon its ability 
to show up objects in different planes. It is more highly perfected 
in the lower powers and there is still room for great improvement. 
In the examination of molds ever)' worker is somewhat handicap- 
ped on account of improper penetrability. 

ABBE CONDENSER. 

A most important accessor)- to the microscope is the Abbe 
condenser. There are two special makes, the chromatic and the 
achromatic. The first is suitable for ordinary work, but for photo- 
micrography the achromatic is almost indispensable. Fig, 8 shows 
a condenser of special construction, which can be swung out. Two 
diaphragms ordinarily go with it. one above and one below, and 



r -^ 



Fig. 8. Abbe Condenjer 

in addition to tliese there is a s|>ecial arrangement made for hold- 
ing the polariscope and other accessories for special illumination. 
The mirror under the .Abbe condenser is plain on one side and 
concave on the other, the concave side being used to illuminate 
specimens in a living state, and the light is regulated with the 
iris diaphragm. The direct rays of the sun should never be used. 
Some writers prefer the light from a white cloud, but more uni- 



THE LABORATORY AND ITS EQUIPMENT. ]H 

form results are obtained from the Welsbach light. After one be- 
comes accustomed to this light it becomes easier to make compara- 
tive study. For photomicrography the electric light is frequently 
employed, but the acetylene light is better in e\'ery respect, because 
the details are more clearly brought out. 

PHOTOMICROGRAPHIC CAMERA. 

This need not be an expensive apparatus. The one shown in 
Plate 2 is well suited for the work, because the camera and opti- 



Plalc 2. Pholomicrographic Camera 

cal bench are solidly and conveniently held by a single support, giv- 
ing them stability and perfect alignment without the risk of its 
disturbance. 

In making good photomicrograph? there are several points 
which must be carefully borne in mind in order to secure good 
results: First, a good slide preparation; second, a good miscro- 
scope stand, provided with objectives and eyepieces, having the 



20 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

qualities described under the head of "The Microscope;" a proper 
screeti. acetylene Hght. and first-class isociiromatic or orthochro- 
matic plates. The development of the plates and the printing are 
all well understood by anyone familiar with photography. 

THE I.VCUBATOR. 

The one shown in the cut is admirably adapted for the cultiva- 



tion of bacteria. To this mu.st be attached a thermostat, which 
can be regulated, so that any desired temperature may be main- 
tained constantly. This apparatus is very necessary in the cultiva- 
tion of a great variety of bacteria and the usual temperature em- 
ployed is 98°F., although for special organisms a room tempera- 
ture is better. The incubator should be provided with a glass door 



THE LABORATORY AND ITS EQUIPMENT. 21 

SO that cultures may be observed witliout opening excepting when 
it is absolutely necessary. Heat is supplied by the Koch's satety 
burner, which turns off the gas supply automatically in case of ac- 
cident. For testing canned goods to determine if the sterilizing 
process has been sufficient the incubator is almost indispensable. 



THU AUTOCLAV. 

This apparatus resembles in many respects the ordinary steam 
retort used in every cannery. A little water covers the bottom 
and steam is generated by means of a triple Bunsen burner, so that 
any desired temperature can be raised. As shown by the cut the 



top is arranged so that it can be clamped down, and a safety valve, 
thermometer and steam gauge are attached to the top so that they 
may be easily seen. This apparatus is used for sterilization of all 
culture media, and such media as are not injured by high tem- 
peratures are sterilized in nne operation, where four or five opera- 
tions are required in the laboratory not equipped with the auto- 
clav. It affords an excellent means of determining the heat re- 
sisting power of various spores. 



CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 
THE CENTRIFUGE. 




This apparatus is used in the laboratory for various purposes. 
It is almost indispensable for breaking up emulsions formed by 
solvents in determining the presence of pre^iervatives in food prod- 
ucts. It is also useful in separating: blood scrum from the corpus- 
cles. It is useful in precioitaEine the tubcrcule bacilli from sputum 
made into emulsions. It is use<l frequently in determining the 
presence of fat in milk, cream, chee'^e and other substances. 

DTSTIIXINf; APPA1<.\TI.IS. 



Fig. 12, Distillinp .■\pparatus 

This apparatus is necessary for distilling water and other sub- 
stances where a clear solution is desired. It is made of heavy 
copper, is lined with movable head, and the condensing worm is 
made of pure block tin. 



THE LABORATORT AND ITS EQUIPMENT. 

ANALYTICAL SCALES. 



These balances are graduated in lOO divisions for i ni.m. and 
show the sensibility of i/2C« m. g. The beam and its hangings 
are of pure aluminum; the bearings are of agate with agate knives. 
These balances are used in fine analytical work, such as the deter- 
mination of the amount of tin used on tin piate and the weighing 
of minute quantities of any chemical. Such a balance is indispen- 
sable in a well-equipped laboratory. 

WATER BATH.

This apparatus is employed for evaporating substances which

are affected by more intense heat. There is probably no apparatus 
in the laboratory which is employed more constantly than this. 



PARAFFINE BATH.

This bath is very useful for high temperatures and is the one 
employed for the conversion of saccharin into salicylic acid. It is 
very useful where temperatures running from i2o^to 250°C. are 
required.

Fig. 17. Novy Forceps 



THE LABORATORY AND ITS DQUIPMENT. 25 

The two cuts show the character of the forceps used generally 
in bacteriological work. The Novy forceps are convenient for 
handling cover-glasses, while the Cornet are large and firm and 
are so constructed that they will hold stains in fluid form on the 
cover-glass, so that they will not run down underneath nor onto 
the forceps.

CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 



This apparatus is used for making sections of the internal 
organs of such animals as Guinea pigs, rabbits, etc., shown in 
chapter on preservatives. The feed is controlled by an adjustable 
cam having a scale marked with a number of teeth, providing for 
any thickness of section from one up to twenty-five microns or 
more, and is absolutely reliable. The sections which are photo- 
graphed in this volume were cut from one to two microns in thick- 
ness. For bacteriological" and pathological work this apparatus is 
indispensable.

BACTERIA.— DESCRIPTION AND CLASSIFICATION. 33 



CHAPTER II. 

Bacteria— Description and Classification 

Spore Formation. Nature of Bacteria. Influence of Electricity 
on Bacteria. Influence of Various Temperatures. Influence 
of Light. Motility. Chromogenic Bacteria. Bacterial Prod- 
ucts. Slime, Ropiness, Etc. 



Bacteria belong to the lower vegetable kingdom and are not 
properly named germs or microbes, which terms embrace a larger 
meaning including animalcules and lower insect life. In 1683 
Leeuwenhoek made the discovery of bacteria while examining the 
scraping of the teeth, and for nearly two hundred years bacteria 
were thought to be animal life. In 1875, several investigators, 
Cohn, Naegeli and others, settled the fact that they belonged to 
the vegetable kingdom, principally on account of their resemblance 
to the algae in their manner of reproduction, growth and multipli- 
cation. The distinction between these low vegetable forms and the 
lowest forms of animal life is not so easily determined as we might 
suppose, for the reason that there are so many unknown facts 
concerning both, which science up to this time has not been able 
to make clear. Although the microscope has been brought to a 
degree of perfection hardly to be improved, there are still forms of 
life which are beyond its power. It was thought until recently 
that bacteria were the smallest forms of life, but the researches of 
Dr. Koch and others have brought to light that there are still 
smaller organisms which are the probable causes of maladies such 
as Foot and Mouth disease, Horse Sickness and Rinderpest. 

However, there are so many characteristics of plant life in 
bacteria, that they are properly assigned to the vegetable kingdom. 
They resemble in many ways the higher forms of microscopical 
plant life, viz.: molds and yeasts which are classed as func;-!, but 
in size they are very much smaller. Bacteria multiply by fission 
or division, from which characteristic they are termed Schizomy- 
cetes. The division takes place by a lengthening, when a constric- 
tion takes place thus :

34 CANNING AND PRESERVING OP FOOD PRODUCTS. 

The yeasts multiply by budding as also do some of the molds 
under certain conditions. The yeasts are termed Blastomycetes. 
The molds naturally grow in a thread-like manner, spreading out 
and sending up fine hair-like tufts or hyphae, hence they are termed 
Hyhomycetes. The classification of bacteria is not complete. There 
are various forms which are taken as types, but changes often take 
place due to the character of the substances in which they are found. 
, which cause one class to appear very like another class. The classi- 
fication as we have it is based upon the form, size, motility, manner 
of dividing, formation of spores, the presence of flagella or hair- 
like propellers, their ability to resist high temperatures, the enzymes 
or products resulting from their growth, the colors formed by cer- 
tain kinds, the flavor produced by others, their manner of growth 
on certain artificial media or food specially prepared for them and 
many other ways, but first they can be divided into three classes 
with reference to external appearance.

A very short bacillus is often termed a bacterium. The spirilla 
or curved forms are often joined together to form a spiral and 
were called vibrios in Pasteur's time. There are very great differ- 
ences in sizes of bacilli, some being quite short and thick, others 
very long and delicate, and vice versa. Some have square ends, 
others are rounded. 

There are many different kinds of bacteria which resemble 
each other in all that the microscope will reveal, and their identifi- 
cation depends upon their behavior under variou^i conditions. It 
is a fact that the identification of verv few bacteria can be deter- 
mined by the microscope alone, but after observing a certain form 
in manv conditions, its identitv mav be prettv clearlv determined. 
Changes in temperature while growing: cultivations in acid or al- 
kaline media; cultivations in fluid and on solid media may give 
rise to varied shapes, colors and products, which may be noted 
and the character of the organism established. 

The action of chemicals, dyes, salt and sugar solutions may 
cause what is known as plasmolysis. which is a shrinking of the 
cell membrane and the granulation of the protoplasm or contents 
of the cell. Sometimes the c^l! membrane disappears so that the 
bacillus appears as a row of little round balls.

One fact has been established which is interesting to the stu- 
dent of evolution, i. e., one kind of bacillus never develops into, 
another kind. Ivike springs from like, just as in the higher forms 
of life. If there are hybrids among them it has not been proven, 
but there is some evidence of this in disease organisms, particularly 
in mammal and avian tubercule bacilli. Bacteria are known to 
change completely in some respects, but their identity is not lost.. 
We have seen certain species which ordinarily do not liquefy gela- : 
tin, suddenlv divide into two classes, one of which will ever after- i 
ward liquefy gelatin, and vice versa. Proteus Zenker i is probably 
a type of this species.

The illustration in Fig. 20 gives a good idea of the appearance 
of different types as they appear under the microscope. 

The manner of vegetation or multiplication is as follows : 

The Coccus vegetates by becoming longer, constriction follows 
and finally complete separation. 

When they remain united in twos they are named Diplococci. 

^A'hen they divide in two directions to make fours, they are 
named Tetrugoni, 

When they remain united forming chains they are named 
Streptococci. 

When they form bunches resembling grapes they are named 
Staphylococci. 

When they divide in three directions making %eight cells and 
remain united in bundles they are named Sarcini. 

The rod forms may lengthen, divide and separate, or may 
form pairs or chains resembling sausages. These chains are easily 
broken up by agitation so that they appear more frequently in the 
field of view under the microscope in all three forms. 

LIFE HISTORY OF BACTERIA. 

Bacteria are present almost everywhere, in the ground, Jn the 
air, clinging to dust and floating matter, and in water. They find 
their way into living bodies and plants and are most numerous 
where there is decomposition of organic matter. The air in mid- 
ocean is free from them, because all suspended particles are de- 
posited in the water and the air is washed until it is pure. The air 
at high altitudes is almost free from bacteria and the soil at the 
depth of twelve feet also. Water from artesian wells is almost 
free, and whatever contamination it has is due to the deposit of 
germ life from the surface. The air that is exhaled from the 
lungs is free; no matter how many thousands of bacteria are in- 
haled, they are caught by the hairs and mucous in the air passages 
and cast out or eventually destroyed, except where disease is con- 
tracted. The origin of bacteria is not known, but is shrouded in 
the mystery of creation. Tliere is evidence that new species are 
created, although it cannot be stated as a positive fact. New dis- 
eases make their appearance and cases of spoilage in food products 
occur which seem to be new. The great majority of bacteria are 
harmless to man, indeed are very necessary and indispensable as 
decomposing agents of dead organic matter. Through their in- 
strumentalitv, obnoxious accumulations are reduced to elementary 
forms capable of building up new life, both animal and vegetable. 

There is another class called pathogenic bacteria which are ijij 
strumental in the destruction of living animals, including man. This 
class is to the bacterial flora what the poisonous plants and weeds 
are to the higher forms in the vegetable kingdom, and like these 



BACTERIA.— DESCRIPTION AND CLASSIFICATION. 37 

are in the minority. Bacteria, as we have stated, are almost uni- 
versally distributed, but are not always in the full vegetating form 
as we see them under the microscope. They become dried up, or 
in spore form are wafted through the air or are carried by water 
until they are lodged upon certain kinds of organic material which 
furnish them the necessary elements for growth, which is termed 
vegetation. This is a multiplication which continues until certain 
conditions arise, such as change of temperature or chemical com- 
position, due to their own action or the products formed by other 
kinds of bacteria vegetating at the same time with them, or by con- 
ditions arising from natural causes, when they either perish or 
pass into a resting or dormant state. The resting state is charac- 
terized by a drying up of the cell mernbrane or the formation of 
spores. While it is probable that nearly all bacteria give rise to 
spores of some kind, this has not been demonstrated as a fact, be- 
cause the conditions under which we cultivate them for study and 
observation are not always as favorable as the conditions under 
which they grow naturally ; then, again, the extreme minuteness of 
many forms prevents the close examination necessary to establish a 
complete life history. There is evidence that spore formation may 
go on in a field far beyond the power of our best microscopes. 
The phenomenon of spore formation is observed, however, in the 
life history of a large number of bacteria, and the formation and 
liberation of spores in many cases can be watched with interest in 
the hanging drop cultures. The formation of spores is not always' 
due to the causes assigned above, viz., the exhausting of the food 
supply, etc., for it frequently occurs when the nourishment is mosti 
favorable for natural vegetation or multiplication. We must make[ 
a clear distinction between spore formation and vegetation, the 
spores correspond to the seed in higher plant life and are formed 
for the perpetuation of the species, while the vegetation is a multi- 
plication, not by seed formation but by division, and may go on 
almost indefinitely, if the bacteria are constantly transplanted into 
fresh nutrient material. (There are exceptions to this however.) 
The pathogenic bacteria do not naturally show spore formation, 
because the living body supplies them constantly with fresh ma- 
terial for multiplication. Some of the pathogenic bacteria when 
grown artificially in the laboratory on nutrient media, do give 
rise to spores, showing their relationship to the ordinary non- 
pathogenic bacteria. Anthrax and Tetanus are examples of this 
kind.

Nearly all text-books speak of two kinds of spore formation, 
viz., endospores and arthrosporcs, from a theory advanced by De 
Bary. The endospore is always formed within the cell. The arth- 
rospore formation is supposed to be a complete thickening of the

cell membrane which contracts so that the cell thus becomes a 
spore. The arthrospore theory, however, is not well founded be- 
cause the actual observance of this phenomenon is wanting. We 
are only certain of endospore formation. The formation of spores 
is thus observed : The whole bacillus is first seen as a colorless, 
homogeneous cell, showing no bright spots. When it advances to 
the state of spore formation, fine granules can be detected scat- 
tered throughout the cell, some very small, others larger and ir- 
regular, one bright spot continues to grow larger and brighter and 
the other granules may probably be absorbed by it — the bright 
spot, at first irregular, now begins to assume definite shape, either 
round or ellipsoidal, with a dark line forming around it which 
seems to grow thicker, forming a wall which seems to enclose all 
the contents or protoplasm of the cell, or the protoplasm may go 
to build up the spore wall, which is probably the case. The old 
cell is now merely a shell containing the spore and may soften and 
disappear in the surrounding fluid, leaving the bright spore in a 
free state. In some cases the cell remains together with the spore 
and may not dissolve. This complete process may occupy several 
days, but is often accomplished in a much shorter time. 



BACTERIA.— DESCRIPTION AND CLASSIFICATION. 3fl 

Ordinarily one spore develops within a single bacillus, but A. 
Koch has mentioned that Bacillus Inflatus has two; this is im- 
probable. Not every bacillus gives rise to spores— it sometimes is 
observed that a whole chain of bacilli will be seen with spores ex- 
cepting one or two which seem barren.

Spores develop in a certain position in the bacilli of the same 
kind, which is a guide to the student for identification. When a 
single spore develops in the end it is named a terminal spore, when 
in the middle of the cell it is called a median spore, when in a posi- 
tion between these two it is called an intermediate spore. During 
spore formation the form of the mother cell may remain unchang- 
ed, but more of swelling takes place at the point of spore forma- 
tion, so that the bacillus represents a drum stick, club, or nail 
head, if the spore is terminal and may resemble a spindle or lemon, 
if the spore is median or intermedi.ite. this form is designated as 
a Clostridium.

The size of spores varies ; they are usually oval or ellipsoidal 
ifi to 3/A in length (*/* =1/25,000 of an inch) by 5ft to i/* in breadth, 
although we have reason to believe there are some very much 
smaller.

As we have stated before, the formation of spores is the means 
of perpetuating the species, consequently a number of bacteria are 
known to give rise to spores whenever the conditions are such that 
the bacilli cannot continue in the vegetating state. In order that 
the spore may be able to live through great changes in tempera- 
ture, the cell wall is thick and not easily penetrated by heat or dyes, 
consequently in the ordinary staining methods, the spores present 
their oil-like refractory appearance, while the surroundings are per- 
fectly stained. 

On account of the heat-resisting power of spores, the study of 
this phenomenon is interesting to the canner. At one time it was 
believed that the bacilli as well as the spores could be destroyed by 
212 degrees F., steam heat, in fifteen minutes, and no less an au- 
thority than Koch fell a victim to this theory, which E. von Es- 
march overthrew. The spores of some bacteria were found to be 
able to sustain life after continuous boiling for six to ten hours. 
The same spores were destroyed, however, by a temperature of 
250 degrees for fifteen minutes, steam heat directly applied. This 
extreme heat-resisting power led some famous bacteriologists into 
error. Prominent among them was Von Liebig, who built up a 
theory of spontaneous generation, founding it on the life which 
spontaneously destroyed certain infusions such as meat, milk and 
hay, after all life (as he thou|R:ht) had been killed by boiling heat. 
Pasteur and Tyndall did not follow this theory, but labored to dis- 
cover the cause of their failure to preserve certain infusions. After 
numerous experiments they were able to state positively that there 
were forms of life which could live through the boiling point: so 
the system of discontinuous heating was discovered by Tyndall and 

*The Greek letter m is an abbreviation for the Greek word microfi, which 
means small and is equivalent to jrA^a ^^ ^^ inch. 



BACTERIA.— DESCRIPTION AND CLASSIFICATION. 41 

this method of sterilization is still used to this day as a means of 
sterilizing cei^tain materials which are altered by the employment 
of high temperatures. 

The theory was built upon the fact that the tender, vegetating 
forms of life were easily destroyed by temperatures as low as i6o 
degrees F., consequently after heating once the first day, Tyndall 
allowed the infusions to cool, and stand long enough for the spores 
to begin to develop into bacilli, when he again subjected them to a 
second heating, and repeated the process three times, by which he 
killed all, the spores having all started to germinate. While this 
system is useful for the sterilization of some infusions, it cannot 
be declared infallible, since only the aerobic bacteria (i. e., bacteria 
which grow in the presence of air), would develop from their 
spores during the intervals between the heatings. The spores of 
the anaerobic bacteria would not germinate unless the process were 
repeated in a condition where air was expelled. This would re- 
quire a number of heatings, some after exposure to air for the 
spores of aerobic bacteria to germinate and some after the exclu- 
sion of air for the spores of the anaerobic bacteria to germinate. 
For ordinary purposes, however, the temperature of 250 degrees 
F. was found sufficient to destroy all life in material which was 
not altered by the heat. 

Under ordinary conditions, the spores of bacteria will live for 
a number of years. Cold does not seem to destroy the spores 
and only a few antiseptics will kill them. Pressure of great power 
does not destroy them nor have electricity nor the X-rays proved 
successful destructive agents. Radium has no devitalizing power, 
as demonstrated by Prescott. Carbolic acid, bichloride of mercury, 
and hydrocyanic acid will destroy them in a few minutes, but ordi- 
nary antiseptics in such proportions as are commonly used for the 
preserving of certain condiments, do not destroy the spores, but 
produce conditions which are unfavorable for their vegetating into 
full-grown bacilli. 

THE SPORE IS THE LIFE SEED of any given species, 
and if all moisture is absorbed from its surroundings, it will dry 
up, the membrane around it will harden, and it may cling to dust 
or floating particles in the air, and be wafted here and there by 
currents of air until it falls into a substance suitable for its germi- 
nation, or it may die, although it has been known to remain alive 
and have power to germinate after many years of dormancy. 

When it falls into a suitable medium for its germination, the 
spore-wall softens and a considerable amount of moisture is ab- 
sorbed, which results in the development of a living cell : this will 
lengthen and divide, remain attached or become free, until the con- 
ditions are reached for the cells to form spores again. Spores do 



42

not multiply, they simply furnish the life for one new cell, which 
will multiply. 

THB GERMINATION OF SPORES is different in many 
cases, although it is probable that spores of a given bacillus always 
germinate in the same manner. The observation of spores germi- 
nating is a tedious proceeding, requiring much time and careful 
preparation. It is usually observed in the hanging drop culture, 
which is made by placing a drop of nutrient material on a cover- 
glass and inoculating this with a species which has formed spores 
in some other medium. The cover-glass is then inverted on a slide 
with a hollow-ground cell in the center so that the drop will hani^: 
without touching the glass, the cover-glass being sealed all around 
by vaseline to prevent evaporation, thus: 




Fig. 24. Hanging Drop Culture 

H — Hanging Drop. 

C — Cover glass over the ceU. 

V — Vaseline holding cover glass over slide S. 



The edge of the drop is found with the low power objective 
first, and then a drop of cedar oil is placed on the top of the cover- 
glass and the 1-12 oil immersion lens is brought down into focus. 
The first sign of spore germination will be a glistening of the 
spore, which will be seen to swell and lengthen, grow less bright, 
until a homogeneous cell is formed showing very little or no re- 
fraction. 

The germination is accomplished in several ways. 

Probably the most common method of spore germination is 
the growth of the bacillus from one end. Tlie end appears to open 
and the young cell pushes out in the long axis of the spore. An- 
other method is the opening of the spore at the sides, when the 
spore seems to split in halves, letting the young cell out in a right 
angle to the long axis of the spore. 

Another method is the opening of the spore wall on one side 
through which the young cell emerges in a bent form, the middle 
coming out first and then the ends, causing the young cell to look 
like a magnet or horse-shoe. 



BACTERIA.— DESCRIPTION AND CLASSIFICATION. 43 

Another method of germination is the swelling of the spore 
by a gradual elongation of the spore, which seems to absorb mois- 
ture, increasing in protoplasm until a fully developed cell is born, 
able to multiply in the regular manner.

The study of spores is most interesting to the manufacturer 
of food products, for the reason that they are very resistant to 
heat, which is usually employed to sterilize all canned goods and 
many other kinds of goods as well. There are some varieties of 
spores w^hich live through continuous boiling for five hours and 
more, but are killed at 250° F. by directly applied steam heat, in 
about fifteen minutes. Now, this heat must come directly onto the 
spores, so the larger and denser the volume, the longer it takes to 
heat it to the center. * Various liquids, such as soups, are canned, 
which convey the heat better than heavier materials, such as corn, 
peas, meats, etc., and to destroy the spores of certain classes of 
bacteria the temperature of 250° F. must reach the center of the 
package and be maintained for about fifteen minutes. For experi- 
mental tests, there are made especially for this purpose self-regis- 
tering thermometers which fit into the can and remain in the center. 
When the temperature reaches 250° F. the mercury does not drop 
on cooling — owing to a constriction in the tube which holds it — 
until it is shaken down by gentle tapping. 

Valuable knowledge may be gained by the canner from per- 
sonal experiment wnth this device in his sterilizing processes. By 
noting how many minutes it requires to reach the proper tempera- 
ture after the retort thermometer indicates the right temperature 
on the outside, he can know just how long he must process his 
goods to destroy the spores of such bacteria as are known to infest 
the particular product which he is canning. The canner must first 
study just what bacteria are continually present in the particular 
prodticts he is manufacturing; this is found out by cultivation on 
ntitrient media similar to those products. Later we will explain 
how to make these cultivations so that all kinds of germs may be 
isolated nnd identified, when grown by themselves, and experiments

made by inoculating sterile cans and subjecting the bacteria to vari- 
ous temperatures in order to learn their resisting power to heat, 
etc. 

NATURE OF BACTERIA. 

COMPOSITION . Water makes up a large per cent, of the 
composition of bacteria and is calculated to be from 60 to 85 per 
cent. ; fats, from i to 40 per cent. ; proteins, 10 to 15 per cent. ; min- 
eral compounds, i per cent. ; sometimes cellulose and granulose are 
present, particularly in the carbohydrate species. All bacteria con- 
tain one or more soluble ferments which are compounds capable 
of producing fermentation, and are called enzymes. The class of 
bacteria which produces diseases in man and animals produces 
poisons called ptomaines and toxins, which may be extracted. From 
the non-pathogenic bacteria also the enzymes may be extracted, 
some of which are used in producing desired fermentations. Heat 
usually destroys these enzymes as well as a great many toxins from 
pathogenic bacteria. 

The average composition of bacteria is estimated at 85 per 
cent, water and 15 per cent, dry matter (by Kappes). The dry mat- 
ter is made up as follows : 

Per cent. 

Etherial extract (fat, etc.) 4.8 

Albumen 71.2 

Ash 13.5 

Undetermined matter io»5 

There is a very large per cent, of nitrogen ni bacteria, far more 
than in the higher vegetable orders, and carbon enters largely in- 
to the composition of the protoplasm. The bacterial cells are de-. 
void of chlorophyll — (the green coloring matter of the higher 
vegetable kingdom) — consequently, they cannot obtain the carbon, 
as do the higher plants, from carbonic acid gas, but are dependent 
upon carbon compounds. Sugar furnishes carbon, also other car- 
bohydrates and fats, proteins, and likewise organic compoimds, such 
as glycerin, tartaric and lactic acids. 

The nitrogen of the air cannot be utilized by bacteria (one 
class excepted), consequently they are dependent upon nitrogenous 
compounds for their supply. Animal and vegetable matter is al- 
ways accessible, the proteins of which furnish the nitrogen. Chem- 
ical compounds and acids can also be utilized. 

The hydrogen is obtained from the same sources as the carbon 
and nitrogen, but the oxygen may be obtained from the atmos- 
phere or from compounds, according to the kinds of bacteria and 
their environments. 

Some bacteria thrive well in media which are acid; others 
thrive better in alkaline media. 



BACTERIA.— DESCRIPTION AND CLASSIFICATION. 45 

The chemical composition of bacteria, therefore, depends to a 
great extent upon the nature of the substance upon which they are 
thriving. Certain bacteria may grow luxuriantly in an acid mfedium 
such as tomatoes and fruit juices and may remain dormant or 
die in an alkaline medium. Then, again, other kinds of ^bacteria 
which grow well on an alkaline medium will remain dormant or 
die in an acid medium. To this class the majority of bacteria be- 
long. This difference in the nature of bacteria will throw some 
light on the different temperatures employed in sterilization, the 
character of the bacteria being determined by the degree of jicidity 
of the material. 

BACTERIA AND THEIR SUPPLY OF OXYGEN. 

Many kinds of bacteria obtain the oxygen so necessary for the 
process of multiplication from the air, and if the air is cut off they 
either remain dormant or die — these are called aerobic; others can- 
not use the oxygen of the air, so they obtain their supply from or- 
ganic compounds, such as the proteins and carbohydrates; these 
are called anaerobic. There are others which accommodate them- 
selves to whatever condition in which they may be placed, if aerobic 
by nature they will still grow in an anaerobic state and are called 
facultative anaerobes; or if anaerobic by nature and grow in an 
aerobic state they are called facultative aerobes. 

Nearly all bacteria found in improperly sterilized hermetically 
sealed packages are either anaerobic or facultative anaerobic. This 
latter class sometimes causes more violent fermentation when forc- 
ed to grow in the absence of free oxygen than when growing nat- 
urally ; being deprived of free oxygen the tearing down of organic 
compounds is accomplished with great rapidity to supply the re- 
quired oxygen, while the actual multiplication is lessened. This 
fact is interesting to canners, as it accounts for the rapid spoilage 
of goods which have been improperly sterilized. Here the fermen- 
tation is much more violent and rapid than in the packages where 
there is a perceptible leak through which the oxygen from the air 
passes. It is curious that sometimes the product will be found 
perfectly sweet at the bottom of a can which has a large leak in 
the top, while the whole surface is covered with molds, yeasts and 
bacteria of various kinds. In this case the evolution of gas is not 
as great as when the can is undergoing chemical changes in the 
absence of atmospheric oxygen. 

To the facultative anaerobes a large per cent, of losses in can- 
ned goods is due. The anaerobic bacteria, however, cause spoilage 
in many cases where the others are destroyed, because they belong: 
to the soil and are spore -bearing and have the power to withstand 
very high temperatures and afterward develop. All anaerobes 
known, except possibly one species, are bacilli, that is, rod-shaped.

INFUENCe OF FLKCTRICITY ON BACTERIA. 

Cohn experimented with electricity generated by two cells, 
passing the current thruugh a fermentable substance where bacteria 
were present and found that they were not killed, but that changes 
were produced which made the niedium unfit for bacteriological 
deveioptnent. Later a stronger current of electricity was tried by 
other investigators and some forms were killed, but the resistant 
forms found in milk were not affected, which dashed the hopes of 
those seeking a speedy method of sterilizing milk. D'Arsonvai 
and Charrin used a current of 10,000 volts on a certain species of 
germ found in pus, but only a decrease in virulence was observed. 

Electricity, however, is used in the manufacture of wine and 
cognac for maturing the flavor and not for antiseptic purposes. A 
certain mellow flavor is produced by pouring the liquors over plates 
charged with electricity. 

The results of these experiments proved that electricity was 
not practical as a germicide, but that certain chemical reactions 
were produced which were inimical to bacterial growth. If salt 
were present in the current it would be either decomposed into acid 
and alkali or set free, chlorine and hypochlorites. Sometimes per- 
oxide of hydrogen and ozone would be generated by the electric cur- 
rent in sufficient amounts to destroy a number of non-resistent 
forms. Heat also is generated which will destroy germs of the 
same class. 

Jt was expected that the X-rays would pro\'e to be of value as 
a germicide, but many experiments have resulted negatively. Like-

infIvUKnce: of temperature. 

The subject of temperature is most interesting to canners and 
manufacturers of food products because it opens up a way of suc- 
cessfully destroying the scavengers which constantly menace those 
products. 

Bacteria grow best between the temperatures of 70° F. and 
lOO^F., but are able to live through great changes which seem 
marvelous to those who have not had experience and suffered losses 
through their ravages. 

There has been discovered one species of bacteria which multi- 
plies at 32°F. It was discovered in 1887 by J. Forster growing on 
the surface of salt water fish, a phosphorescent variety. Later it 
was discovered by B. Fischer tliat the soil and also sea water con- 
tained many varieties which could grow at 32'^F. A great num- 
ber of these hardy varieties grow in milk and drain water. 

Experimenters have tried various temperatures as low as 250^ 
below zero, also in solidified oxygen for many hours, and some va- 
rieties lived through the tests. Severe cold is germicidal to many 
species. 

This is interesting in connection with cold storage and ac- 
counts for some peculiar changes we have witnessed. In a general 
way it can be stated that the freezing point will retard decomposi- 
tion of food stuffs, in fact 33° and 34°F. will keep fruits and vege- 
tables very well for a long time, but there is loss in flavor from 
the formation of CO2 (carbonic acid gas), due to the breaking up 
of small quantities of sugar, either by bacteria or the cell life of 
the fruit itself. 

The temperature required to protect meats and butter is con- 
siderably lower than freezing, averaging about 13^ to io°F., but 
even in this temperature after a time certain changes may be noted 
which are not due to bacterial action, (but are due to a loss of vola- 
tile ethers which are retained by hard freezing.) Commerically, cold 
storage is a good method of carrying over food stuffs of many 
kinds, but of course decomposition will set in quickly after they are 
brought into warm temperatures for the reason that their exposure 
to germ-laden atmosphere has invited hosts of bacteria which will 
start their functions when brought into warmer temperatures. 

It is my belief that the cold storage system will come into 
favor with the canner and preserver. In a series of experiments 
recently tried, fruits and vegetables kept nicely when frozen solid. 
Such products if subjected to IS'^F. freeze solid and retain their 
flavor fairly well, but can only be used in jams and sauces, etc.. 



BACTERIA.— DESCRIPTION AND CLASSIFICATION. 49 

owing to the collapse which takes place when thawed out. Even 
for these purposes, the system is advantageous, especially when 
overcrowded with raw fruits and vegetables the canner can put 
into cold storage his surplus, which may be made up later into 
marketable products, when the receipts of raw materials are less. 

The cost of building a cold storage plant for every canner is 
too great to even be considered, but those whose factories are lo- 
cated within a short distance of such a plant can take advantage 
of it. Indeed a series of experiments along this line might prove 
most satisfactory. 

While we have found rare species of bacteria able to live and 
multiply in freezing temperatures, it is interesting to note that there 
are varieties able to thrive at an extreme temperature in the other 
direction. These bacteria are non-pathogenic, that is, not disease 
producing, in man and animal. They are called thermophilous, 
or heat loving bacteria, and one species was discovered by Miquel 
called Bacillus Thermophilus, which multiplies at I58°F. When 
we remember that this temperature kills animal life and coagulates 
egg albumen and blood serum, we are impressed with this remark- 
able fact. This is an aerobic bacillus about i/a in thickness and 
forms threads at about I40°F. and only thrives between the tem- 
peratures of 98° and i62°F. This bacillus is common in sewage 
and is found in the alimentary canal of man and animals. 

There are a number of bacteria which grow well at high tem- 
peratures, most of w-hich are found in the soil, in sewage water 
and in the alimentary tract. During the extremely hot weather of 
summer, these heat loving bacteria grow luxuriantly, and cause 
fermentation where least suspected. 

In this connection I wish to remind our readers that they may 
have seen cans of improperly sterilized goods fermenting in the 
center of a pile where the temperature would be almost scalding. 
I have seen cans of corn fermenting with so much heat that I could 
scarcely hold a can in my hand. There has been very little investi- 
gation into this phenomenon, but some of these bacteria will be de- 
scribed and their resistance explained. There are certain kinds of 
mold which have the same characteristic*^ as the thermophilous 
bacteria, and cause great loss, especially in the manufacture of cat- 
sups and sauces made from tomatoes. Some of these molds are 
pathogenic also, and are associated with disease in the lungs of 
man and in the bronchial tubes and throats of birds. 

Recently we examined the sputum of a pneumonia patient and 
found the fungus growling; it is called AsperjSfillus Fumigatus and 
will be described later. 

There have been discovered in the hot sulphur springs at 
Tlidze in Bosnia, two kinds of bacteria, one called Bacterium Lud- 
wigi, which developed at a temperature above i22°F.. and the

Aspersrillus Fumigfatusy I«ichtheini 

Origin. — White bread, preserves, catsup, in the lungs and air pas- 
sages of birds; met with in man also. 

Color. — Greenish or bluish-green growth; resembles that of penicilHum 
very much. 

Mycelium. — Mycelial threads and spores are smaller than those of A. 
niger. 

Fruit-Organs. — The fruit hyphae are club-shaped and covered with 
sterigfmae, from which extend rows of spores. The sterigmae are not 
divided. The spores are usually colorless and from 2% /x to 3% n in di- 
ameter. 

Growth. — Rapid. Grows best on bread. 

Bread Flasks. — Low growth; at first bluish-green^ but is grayish-green 
when old. 

Temperature. — Grows best at 37-40® C. Will grow at ordinary 
temperature, but not below 15° C. 

Pathogenesis. — Death was produced in a few days by intravenous 
injections of millions of spores in rabbits and dogs. Mycelia were found 
in the kidneys, heart and other muscles, and sometimes in the liver. 

A pneumonic or pseudo-tuberculous disease is produced by the in- 
halation of the spores in doves and other birds. Natural affections of this 
kind arc frequent among birds. They are met with occasionally in horses 
and in cattle, and sometimes in man. 

In mycoses of man, the lungs, eyes, ears or nose are subject to in- 
vasion. 

The Japanese utilize the growing A. Oryzae as a diastatic ferment. 
Rice grains are converted by it into sugar and dextrin, which when sub- 
jected to fermentation yields the national drink. Sake, containing about 
14% of alcohol. Taka-diastase is a ferment which is derived from an as- 
pergillus similar to that mentioned.

other named Bacillus Capsiilalus, produced endospores which lived 
through a heat of 2i2°F. for four hours without being destroyed. 
We have called attention to the heat-resisting powers of spore- 
bearing bacteria under the head of spores. Among these are sev- 
eral varieties which are found on the skin of potatoes and in milk; 
also one variety found associated with hay, malt, etc. These hardy 
varieties found on potatoes are Mesentericus Vulgatus. Mesenter- 
icus fuscus and Mesentericus ruber, the spores of the last able to 
live through six to ten hours boiling at 2!2°F. Bacillus subtilis,

resistent spores and gave Prof. Tyndalt so much trouble in his ef- 
forts to overthrow the theory of spontaneous generation. 

INFLUENCE OF 1.TGIIT ON B.->lCTERIA. 

In a general way we may .state that direct sunlight is detri- 
mental to the growth of bacteria and is germicidal in many cases. 
The effect of direct rays is injurious to cultures of certain species 
which when thus exposed, lose their power to vegetate when re- 
turned to the dark. The effect of sunlight may be noted in many 
instances by its peculiar action on bacteria. Certain species which 



62 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

are actively motile due to flagella (which will be described later), 
lose their power to move and gradually weaken and die; others 
which are called Chromogenic or color-bearing bacteria, (see sec- 
tion on pigment — producing bacteria), lose their function of pro- 
ducing pigments; the pathogenic bacteria lose their power to pro- 
duce toxins in some cases. 

It is the ultra violet, violet, and blue rays of sunlight which 
are so germicidal ; the green, red and yellow have very little or no 
injurious effect upon bacteria. For extensive literature on this 
phenomenon the reader is referred to Diendonne (A.G.A. iX, 405 
and 537). 

The diffused rays of sunlight have very slight disturbing in- 
fluences on bacteria; likewise arc light and incandescent influences 
may be observed. 

The action of sunlight may produce chemical change in the 
medium on which the bacteria are thriving, such as the oxidation 
of fats, formic acid and formaldehyde and peroxide of hydrogen 
may be formed, which will be germicidal. In this connection let 
me say that these compounds are often formed in canned goods in 
the steam retort by oxidation, and the analyses recently made by 
certain state chemists were faulty in the extreme and produced the 
impression that these chemicals had been purposely added to the 
samples analyzed, when I know^ it to be a fact that they were not. 
They should have known from the very nature of the goods they 
were analyzing that oxidation would naturally take place at the 
temperatures to which the goods had been submitted, that traces 
of these germicides would be formed. Far be it from me to in 
any way discourage the efforts put forth by conscientious investi- 
gators to improve the quality of food, by condemning right meth- 
ods; but when the canning industry is assailed imjustly. and with 
the motive possibly of gainin^^ notoriety, it is proper to protect the 
manufacturers and furnish them with information to refute false 
analytical reports. I personally prepared two of the samples, ab- 
solutely pure in every res])ect. which were submitted to the state 
chemists and their report showed that formaldehyde and benzoates 
were present, which was false in the sense that they had been add- 
ed, and that report gave a wrong impression to the public. They 
should have known that these had not been purposely added, but 
that the faint traces were due entirely to oxidation produced by 
steam heat 25o°F., and that the product would naturally yield 
traces of such preservatives. 

To return to our subject, we have found that sunlight is 
germicidal and that diffused light and electric light are slightly in- 
jurious to bacteria. This will overthrow the idea that wrapping 
wMth brown paper and storing in dark places fruits and vegetables 
canned in tin and glass would prevent fermentation. Bacteria grow

best in the dark and the only value in the ancient custom, was pro- 
tection from dust and protection of color, which sunlight injures 
to some extent. 

MOTILITY. 

My first impression when observing the rapid, almost marvel- 
ous movement of certain bacteria was, that they must surely be- 
long to the animalcules. So rapid was their movement that the 
eye could not possibly follow them. Having focused the edge of a 
hanging drop culture of the typhoid bacillus, I tried over and over 
to move the slide and keep in focus with the fine adjustment of 
the microscope, the swift moving germs, but they quickly passed 
out of the field or dropped so deep in the fluid that it was impossi- 
ble for me to follow them. Other active Vcirieties also are apt to 
create the impression that they are not a part of the vegetable 
kingdom, but their life history and manner of vegetation dispels 
the doubt.

Pasteur regarded the **vibrion butyrique" as an animalcule in 
his early researches, but the higher order of algae have motile 
spores and their movements are extremely rapid too, showing that 
the vegetable kingdom does have actively motile species, and mo- 
tility could not be an argument in opposition to their place in this 
kingdom. 

There are two kinds of motion observed in bacteria, one a 
molecular motion, sometimes called "Brownian motion ;" the other 
is called independent motility. The former is purely a physical 
motion and may be noticed in many particles held in liquid sus- 
pension. There seems to be an oscillating motion peculiar to many 
micrococci and bacilli, a rotary or orbit motion, due perhai)s to the 
vibration of the fluid. The molecules of the fluid may be round 
like shot and roll over and over as slight chemical changes occur 
or by shock or by the influence of the earth, etc. Certainly no one 
has ever seen a molecule of water, but it seems probable that the 
two atoms of hydrogen and the one atom of oxygen might combine 
into a spherical molecule, and if such be the case there would prob- 



54 CANNING AND PRESERVING OP FOOD PRODUCTS. 

ably be great oscillation going on continually, thus accounting for 
the peculiar movement described as ''Brownian movement." Cohen 
made some experiments which seem to lend color to the theory 
given above. Gelatin was gradually added so that all the particles 
held in suspension became quiet and he noticed that all bacteria 
which had no independent motion, also became quiet, while the 
bacteria which had an independent motion moved quite freely. 

The subject has not been fully investigated and the theory 
of molecular oscillation will probably stand. 

Bacteria which have independent motion are endowed with 
organs of locomotion which are most interesting to study. These 
organs are called by different authors flagella, celia, or zvhips, which 
grow out either from the ends or sides of the bacilli or both. The 
number and kind of flagella often determine the species to which 
a certain bacillus belongs. These organs of locomotion were first 
discovered by Ehrenberg in 1836, and more carefully studied by 
Cohen. It was supposed for a long time that only bacilli were 
thus endowed, but in 1887 ^tnd 1890 Loeffler and several others 
claimed to have discovered certain cocci which were motile, but 
this is doubtful. 

These flagella are not visible when the bacteria are stained 
with ordinary dyes; the most powerful objectives do not clearly 
show their presence unless special staining is done to bring them 
into view. Some bacteria have only one polar flagellum. Others 
have two or may have a bunch at the end : still others have them 
evenly distributed over the entire surface of the cell, sometimes as 
many as a hundred. The number and size of the flagella depend 
upon the age of the cells. Usually they are best seen and studied 
in cultures 24 to 36 hours old. 

Flagella are very thin, hair-like appendages, so fine that the 
dyes must be piled upon them to bring them into vision ; they vary 
in length from two to twenty times the length of the bacillus and 
seem to derive active power from the cell itself so that they im- 
part peculiar motion to the rods ; some having a wabbling motion, 
others a creeping motion, others a snake-like motion and still others 
turn somersaults and whirl with a rapidity truly remarkable; and 
the spirochetae have a boring or corkscrew movement. Bacilli are 
classified with reference to the number of flagella (see Fig. 26) 
into four groups — monotricha, having one flagellum at the end; 
amphitricha, having a flagellum at both ends; lophotricha, having 
a bunch of two or more at the end ; and peritricha, having the whole 
surface arrayed with the hair-like whips. 

These propelling organs are so delicate that they are easily in- 
jured and fall off or become looped when disturbed by external 
influences. When they are thus injured they disappear very soon 
and are apparently dissolved in the fluid surrounding them. They 



BACTERIA.— DESCRIPTION AND CLASSIFICATION. 65 

often fall off just at the time of spore formation. This is true of 
nearly all species excepting some anaerobic bacteria. Old cultures 
therefore are not suitable for the demonstration of flagella. I want 
to emphasize this point because the beginner will have considerable 
trouble, even under the most favorable circumstances, to stain the 
delicate celia property ; a young culture is always to be preferred. 

The influence of chemicals, antiseptics, salicylic acid, benzoates, 
etc., is such as to cause loss of motion or death to bacteria, but 
loss of motion does not always mean that the bacteria are dead. 
Often they may be transplanted into favorable nutrient media and 
become as actively motile as before. The enzymes and toxins which 
are the products elaborated by the bacteria themselves when grow- 
ing in a favorable substratum (nutrient substance), often cause loss 
of motion and the agglutination (gathering in bunches), tests are 
made possible by this characteristic. This phenomenon is most 
valuable to the bacteriologist in determining cases of typhoid fever. 
Where the patient has typhoid fever the poison very early is dis- 
tributed through the blood and this poisoned blood will cause the 
agglutination of the typhoid bacilli when they are introduced into 
a drop of the serum, diluted with bouillon. 

Sometimes the microscopist meets with peculiar bodies in a 
field or view where a pure culture of motile bacteria is being

bodies, which he calls "giant zvhips." while studying various an-

CilROMOCENlC BACTKRI.\. 

Chroniogenic bacteria are the species which produce pigments 
or colors of various shades and play an important part in the 
deterioration of food products. There are two classes — Chromo- 
parous and Cromophorous. 

CHROMOPAROUS, or color producing bacteria, are them- 
selves colorless, but they produce pigments of various shades which 
give distinct colors to the food stuffs on which they are growing. 



BACTERIA.— DESCRIPTION AND CLASSIFICATION. 57 

THE CHROMOPHOROUS group produce colors within the 
cells, and may or may not give off the color to the media upon 
which they are growing. The colors produced by the chromo- 
genic bacteria can be distinguished by their behavior towards sol- 
vents. The same bacteria always produce the same color when 
grown in the same temperature and in the same media. Identical 
colors may be produced by more than one variety, but the varieties 
may be differentiated by the chemical reactions of their pigments. 

The red colors are frequently seen like drops of blood on many 
cooked vegetables, such as potatoes, starch, flour, tgg albumen, car- 
rots, meats, milk, onions and others which enter into the formulas 
of soups, sauces, etc. Cane sugar syrup is often affected by these 
colors. The oldest known bacterium producing a red color is Bac- 
terium prodigiosum. Cultures of this organism were used by magi- 
cians years ago to imitate blood spots on bread, whence its name 
of "Bleeding bread'' originated. There are several forms closely 
allied to this, which produce various shades of red from a pink to 
a deep brown red. 

Milk is particularly subject to changes in color by these organ- 
isms; also cheese; but such colors in these products may be pro- 
duced by other causes such as blood, or madder (Rubia tinctorum 
in the fodder fed to the cow. Sometimes cheese assumes a red color 
from a purely chemical change caused by the oxidation of iron 
compounds which develop during the ripening of the curd. These 
chemical changes are quite easily distinguished from the red colors 
produced by bacteria. More frequently cheese owes its red dis- 
coloration to mold fungi belonginof to the group of Eumycetes. 

Dried codfish is very susceptible to red colors so that it resem- 
bles salmon. Three different varieties which cause the trouble have 
been studied by Le Dantec, who states that the loss is estimated 
to be about ten million francs annually, since the people believe that 
codfish affected wn'th this color is poisonous. 

YELLOW COLORS are produced by a number of bacteria, 
but very few- foods are affected by them excepting milk. Milk 
sometimes develops a pale orange yellow and the bacteria causing 
it were first studied by C. J. Fuchs in 1841 and by J. Schroeter in 
1870, the latter isolating two microbes named Vibrio Xanthogenus 
and Bacterium synxanthum as the cause, but he claimed that they 
were found in milk only after boiling. The yellow pigment pro- 
duced by these germs is soluble in w-ater, but not in alcohol nor 
ether. 

BLUE COLORS are produced by several varieties of mi- 
crobes and the principal foodstuffs affected are milk and cheese. 
Milk and cheese enter into the formulas for manufacturing so many 
different varieties of food products that the manufacturer of soups

Bacillus Prodisrioaus 

MONAS PRODIGIOSA, OF EHRENBERG. MICROCOCCUS PRODIGIOSUS. 

Origin. — It is found on starchy substances, such as rice, potatoes, 
moist bread; also on meat, albumen, milk, etc. Causes at times local 
epidemics, infecting foods, as bread, sausages, meat, etc., to which it gives 
a pinkish or red color. Bread so affected has been called "Bleeding 
bread." 

Form. — A short rod, slightly longer than it is wide; it sometimes 
forms threads, especially in slightly acid media or in old cultures; usually 
single or in pairs. 

Motility. — It shows no motion ordinarily except a marked Brownian 
movement The slimy character of the growth decreases in acid or very 
dilute media, and a slight motion may be observed. It has numerous long 
wavy flagella. 

Sporulation. — This has not been observed. It shows marked resist- 
ance to dessication. 

Anilin Dyes. — Stain readily. 

Grozvth. — The growth is very rapid. 

Gelatin Plates. — Deep colonies are round or oval, light brown in color 
and with sharp border. The surface colonies are irregular, with rough 
border, granular, have reddish center, and are surrounded by clear, lique- 
fied gelatin. 

Stah Culture. — The liquefaction is rapid and funnel-shaped, and ex- 
tends along the whole line of inoculation. A red scum is formed on the 
surface of the liquid, which on settling colors the entire contents a bright 
red. 

Streak Culture. — On agar, it forms a spreading growth which is moist 
and abundant and of an intense red color, which is non-diffusible. On 
potato, it grows very rapidly, producing slime and a pigment, which, when 
old, has a metallic, fuchsine-like luster. Odor of trimethylamin. On 
blood-serum, growth is same as on agar, with liquefaction. 

Milk. — Growth takes place and the fat globules hold the pigment in 
solution. Coagulation results. 

Oxygen Requirement. — It is a facultative anaerobe. 

Temperature. — It grow^s best at ordinary room temperature. It ceases 
to form pigment in the incubator and may lose this property temporarily, 
i. e., become attenuated. 

Behavior to Gelatin. — Rapidly liquefies as the result of formation of 
a soluble peptonizing ferment. In acid media this liquefying property 
may be diminished or temporarily lost. 

Serogenesis. — It has a strong odor of trimethylamin on potatoes, and 
ferments sugar solutions. 

Pigment Production. — A bright red pigment is formed on various 
media, and this is soluble in ether, alcohol, chloroform, etc. This pig- 
ment is formed only in the presence of air and at ordinary temperatures — 
not at 37^ 

Pathogenesis. — It is non-pathogenic. In large amounts its soluble pro- 
ducts may have a toxic action. The cellular proteins may induce suppura- 
tion. Animals which are not susceptible to malignant oedema may be ren- 
dered susceptible by an injection of this bacillus. An injection of this 
bacillus saves rabbits inoculated with anthrax.

and sauces will no doubt be interested in these phenomena, which 
he has perhaps frequently met with. 

The principal microbe which prodtices blue colors in milk is 
named Bacillus Cyaiwgenus; but blue discoloration may be ob- 
served also in freshly drawn milk where the cow has fed on the 
flowering rush (Biitomus umbellatus) which contains a blue color- 
ing matter frequently carried into the milk from the stomach of

the cow through the arteries and mamniiilary glands. The dis- 
tinction can easily be made between these two causes by adding a 
small quantity of each kind of milk to normal milk. The one con- 
taining the Bacillus Cyanogenus will soon produce the blue color 
in the normal milk, while there will probably be no change notice- 
able in the other. 

Bacillus is a motile organism re(|uiring oxygen for luxuriant 
growth; the rods measuring from .,l/» to .^i^ broad to 1.4^1 long. 
When a dairj' becomes affected with this organism it is most diffi- 
cult to get rid of it, often requiring complete changes in all utensils 
and thorough disinfection. This microbe grows well on vegetables 
which have been cooked, such as rice and potatoes, which are used 
in various formulas by the canner.

Bacillus Cyanosenue, Fuehs (1841) 

BACILLUS OF BLl'E MILK. 

Origin. — Found in blue milk. 

Form. — Small, rather narrow rods, having slightly rounded ends, two 
to three times as long as wide. Frequently found in paris; rarely in 
threads. 

Motility. — It is very actively motile: has bunch of whips at one end. 

Sporulation. — The small terminal bodies resembling spores are most 
probably involution forms. True spores may form on althea or quince 
jelly. 

Auilin Dyes. — Stain readily. 

Growth. — Rapid. 

Gelatin Plates. — The deep colonies are round, having sharp, smooth 
border ; contents are yellowish and granular. The surface colonies are 
round, moist, elevated, convex masses, finely granular and dark in color; 
at times they may be thin and spreading, having an irregular border. 

Stab Culture. — In the lower part of the puncture there is little or no 
growth. There i*? a thick, moist, dark-gray, spreading growth on the sur- 
face. Gelatin is colored a dark steel-blue, the shade varying with the re- 
action of the medium, being quite blue in neutral or acid media and dark, 
or even black, in very alkaline media. It becomes dark colored when old. 

Streak Culture. — On agar, a dirty gray, ihick. moist covering is 
formed, the medium becoming dark colored. On potato, a similar growth 
is formed which r.^pidly spreads and becomes colored. On blood-serum, 
it forms no color. 

Milk. — It produces no acid or coagulation in sterilized milk, but the 
milk is colored a slate-gray, which turns blue with acids. In unsterilized 
milk, in the presence of lactic acid b-^cteria, the color is sky-blue. This 
color develops from casein and not from Inctose. In bouillon or milk con- 
taining 2% of glucose, lactic acid and a fine blue color are formed. Lac- 
tose is not converted into an acid. 

Oxygen Requirements. — Aerobic. 

Temperature. — Grows best at ordinary temperature, but will grow in 
incubator. The pigment is most marked when it is grown at low tem- 
peratures, 15° to 18° C. 

Behavior to Gelatin. — Does not liquefy. 

Pathogenesis. — No effect on animals.

GRBEN COLORING matter is excreted by quite a number 
of bacteria, some of which in the presence of phosphates give the 
green color while in other media their natural blue color is pre- 
dominant; among these may be mentioned Bacillus pyocyaneus, 
which causes the green color observed in meat which has been ex- 
posed to the air. This is the same organism which gives rise 
to the green pus often seen on wound bandages. Bacillus butyri 
fluorsecens. a fission fungus, was discovered by Dr. T. Lafar in 
1891 as the cause of green discoloration sometimes seen in but- 
ter. Among the more common varieties which produce green pig- 
ment, the following may be mentioned : 



iciltus Cyanogenus, Flagellated 



Bacillus fluorescenes putidus. Bacillus fl. tenuis, Bacillus albus, 
Bacillus viridans and Bacterium syncyaneum; while various molds 
present a green appearance but do not impart their coloring to the 
substratum upon which they grow. The moid Penicillium glaucum 
gives the green color to Roquefort, Gorgonzola, Stilton and Brie 
cheese. There have been discovered some twenty-seven species of 
Penicillium, The green observed in several kinds of cheese it not 
due to bacteria nor fungi, but to copper which was absorbed from

Penicillium Glaucum 

Origin. — It is widely distributed in air, water and soil. It is said 
that sixty per cent of the mold contaminations in the laboratory are due 
to it. 

Color. — Whitish at first, changing to a bluish-green later. 

Mycelium. — Is composed of straight or slightly wavy mycelial threads 
horizontally arranged; from these the fruit hyphae rise vertically. 

Fruit-organs. — The ends of the septate fruit hyphae are forked; they 
are covered with sterigmae, sometimes called besidia. Each of these 
sterigmae bears a row of eight spores or conidia, giving to the whole the 
appearance of a brush. The spores are about 3.5 ^, in width. 

Growth. — Rapid. 

Gelatin Plates. — Whitish floccules are formed by the colonies; these 
gradually increase in size; at the same time the center becomes a green 
color. The gelatin is liquefied early. The above characteristics may be 
seen by means of a low objective. 

Bread Flasks. — A low, finely flocculent covering is formed, white at 
first, but changing to green later. 

Temperature. — Optimum, from 22** to 26^ C. will not grow at body 
temperature. 

Behavior to Gelatin. — Liquefies slowly. 

Pathogenesis. — No effect on animals. It often develops on grapes and 
causes a marked alteration in wine. Gives rise to diastatic and inverting 
ferments. It is said to be used in the preparation of Roquefort cheese.

cheese. 

Canners of meats should guard against the use of meat which 
shows any green discoloration. The presence of the green pigment 
indicates that the meat has been exposed to warm temperature and 
may have more deadly parasites flourishing on the surface and in 
the tissues than the color-bearing germs. There are various bac- 
teria and fungi which produce other colors such as black smut and 
white spots. Packers of corn often experience trouble with black 



spots throughout their cans, sometimes due to these, which will be 
fully described under the head of Corn Packing. The packers of 
canned lobsters have had considerable trouble at times with black 
discoloration, as also do packers of various sea foods, all of which 
will be described in their proper places. 

There are varieties of bacteria which produce violet and pur- 
ple colors which are useful in the manufacture of indigo and other 
shades, but have no importance in the manufacture of food prod- 
ucts.

Viscous fermentation is a most important study for the can- 
ners of molasses, syrups and vegetables, such as peas, string beans, 
asparagus, etc. Grape sugar is often split up by Invertin. pro- 
duced by several varieties of bacteria which form mucinous cap- 
sules and grow in zoogloea or masses all united. There are cocci 
which grow on some foodstuffs without forming the gelatinous 
capsules. The capsules are formed as a sticky envelope around 
the cocci, and sugar, lactose, maltose and dextrin seem to favor 
their development. The capsules are stained by special dyes and 
are not revealed by ordinary staining. 




Fip. 27. Leuconostoc Mcsenteroiiles 



The principal cause of this viscous fermentation in cane sugar 
are the Leuconostoc mesenteroides, which were studied by Van 
Teighem in 1878. wlio published his researches, but he probably 
had several varieties mixed, as his drawings show chains of cocci 
and diplococci. In 1891, however. C. Liesenberg and W. Zopf ob- 
tained pure cultures of the organism and found it to be a coccus 
0.8;> to l.O/» in diameter. 

This germ does not develop the mucinous matter when grow- 
ing on nutrient substances free from sugar, but when grown on 



BACTERIA.— DESCRIPTION AND CLASSIFICATION. 67 

vegetables like peas, beans, beets and carrots, which contain saccha- 
rose and dextrose, zooglea forms appear, somewhat dry at first, 
afterwards becoming softer and sticky. Frequently whole vats of 
molasses will be contaminated by this microbe and when it acts on 
cane sugar syrup, it produces the invertin which retards crystalli- 
zation. The capsule which surround it protects it and enables it 
to withstand high temperatures. 

Another cause of viscous fermentation is the Bacillus Vis- 
cosus Sacchari, which differs from the last organism described in 
that it converts the media on which it develops into a viscid mass 
and does not form the envelope around the cell. 

There are several other varieties which cause viscous fermen- • 
tation, viz. : Bacillus megatherium. Bacillus fluorescens liquefaciens, 
Bacillus vulgatus and others which produce changes in saccharine 
products, giving rise to mucus, amyl alcohol and invertin. Milk 
frequently becomes ropy or slimy so that it can be lifted up in long 
string}' threads, sometimes a yard in length. Alcohol and acetic 
acid are often generated in this kind of milk by two organisms 
isolated by E. Duclax, called by the generic name Actinobacter 
or lustrous bacteria. 

Bacillus mesentericus vulgatus (Flugge) and Bacillus pitui- 
tosi (Loeffler) are most frequently the cause of ropiness, but re- 
cently I have observed a short, plump capsuled bacillus in cream 
which had become ropy. This bacillus when grown on nutrient 
agar develops the capsules and takes the stains quite readily. It 
resembles the Bacillus lactis viscosus, discovered by L. Adametz 
in 1890. All these organisms develop at times in milk which is 
allowed to stand in a warm temperature ; this is easily avoided, but 
there is another organism which develops ropihess at a lower tem- 
perature. It is a large micrococcus about 2a in diameter, easily 
killed by boiling temperature. 

The peculiar flavor of Edam cheese is due to a fission fungus 
called Streptococcus hollandicus, cultivated in pure cultures by the 
Dutch dairymen and cheesemakers. Milk, when sown with this 
fungus, soon becomes ropy and the ropy whey is made into the 
famous cheese. 

In Finland, Sweden and Norway the milk pails are rubbed 
on the inside with the leaves of the butterwort (Pinguicula vul- 
garis) and the cows are fed with the plant. The leaves of this 
plant are infested with the micro organism used by the Dutch 
cheesemakers, consequently the milk is soon ropy, and this thick 
milk, is a commercial article among the Scandinavians. 

Soapy or frothy milk with a slimy sediment is due to a mi- 
crobe called by Weigmann, Bacillus lactis saponacei, usually the 
result of unclean bedding for cows. Many of the impurites in milk 
are due to the uncleanly methods of dairymen, and it is hoped

Form. — Small, thick rods, having rounded ends. Usually found in 
pairs; may form threads. 

Motility. — It is actively motile, having numerous flagella. 

SporuhUion. — Large, medium, roundish spores arc readily formed.

Gelatin Plates. — The colonies are yellowish-white, slightly granular, 
with irregular borders, liquefying rapidly and extensively. 

Stab Culture. — Growth along er.tire line of inoculation, liquefaction 
being more energetic in- the upper part. The liquefied gelatin remains 
turbid for some time. A thin, grayish, folded scum is fonned on the 
top. 

Streak Culture. — On agar a dull white or grayish growth is formed. 
The most characteristic growth develops on potato. The surface is rapidly 
covered with a thick, white, strongly folded, coherent growth, which

that more stringent laws may be passe<l to keep this universal

used in the manufacture of delicate soups, sauces and table delica-

Plate 15. Bacillus Mesemericus Vulgatus, Flagellared 



In the manufacture uf Worcestershire sauce, wine is used fre- 
quently, and is sometimes found to be ropy and slimy, the flavor 
greatly injured. The study of this subject is one more for the 
wine maker than the manufacturer of food products, yet it is well 
to know that such wine is not fit for use and the trouble is due 
to fission fungi studied by Pasteur, and are Bacillus viscosus vini 
and other similar species. 

The same scientist investigated the cause of beer and wort be- 
coming ropy and found a fission fungus which he named Micrococ- 
cus viscosus. This organism does not give rise to violent fermen- 
tation, but seems to perform its function,*? in the development of a 



70 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

gelatinous viscid envelope whicli spreads through the whole Hquid. 
H. Van Lear obtained pure cultures of two varieties, naming them 
Bacillus Viscosns I and II, differing in the quantity of carbon 
dioxid liberated and the amount of viscous matter ; the first pro- 
duces yellow patches and the second a brown formation. 

These two organisms, contrary to the general character of 
viscous ferments, do not require sugar in very large quantities to 
produce the gelatinous envelope, in fact sugar is injurious to them. 
In the manufacture of malt and cider vinegar these organisms make 
their appearance, frequently causing a great deal of trouble. The 
alcohol is favorable to their development but the acidity is germi- 
cidal. About 2 per cent, acid stops develojmiem. 



Viscous fermentation is not confined to the family of bacteria 
(Schizomycetes) alone, but may be caused by some of the Eumy- 
cetes or yeast and mold fungi as well. 

The canner and preserver has difficulties of this nature, par- 
ticularly canners of molasses, syrups, peas, beans, corn, asparagus, 
etc. Owing to the heat resisting power of many species which are 
protected by their gelatinous capsules, sterilization is sometimes 
difficult. To be sure the temperature may be increased and the

time lengthened, but the quality is thereby injured. It would be 
no trouble to increase the process of peas to one hour at 250° F., 
which would perfectly sterilize them, but the result would be more 
of a soup than canned peas — they would all cook to pieces. The 
remedy lies in another direction; the raw product must be properly 
cared for, and not allowed to stand exposed to these scavengers. 
There has been considerable carelessness in this matter in the past. 
Raw material often stood exposed until the slimy formation could 
be detected by the hand. I remember when the new pea vining ma- 
chinery first came into use, the hulled peas were hauled several 
miles on wagons in baskets eight inches deep. They were unloaded 
and piled up for several hours before they were canned, and the 
baskets were very slimy and the peas stuck together so that the 
grading machines were scarcely able to properly sort them into 
various sizes. The cans opened after the season were ropy and 
the peas were flat and had lost their delicate flavor. 

The canners of molasses who do not take proper care of the 
unrefined molasses will experience great difficulty in preventing 
fermentation. They have been resorting to preservatives as a 
means of preventing fermentation and overcoming the difficulties 
with which they are beset through careless methods.

Methods of Cultivating Bacteria. Artificial Media. Method 
of Cultivating Anaerobes. Methods of Simple Staining. 
Method of Staining Flagella. Method of Making Photomi- 
crographs. 

When foodstuff is attacked by bacteria there may be and gen- 
erally are, several varieties involved, and it is essential that these 
varieties be separated and studied in pure cultures under all con- 
ditions. If the canner is having losses from swells and sour goods, 
he is anxious to know what is the cause; the preserver has mold 
appear on the surface of his jellies and preserves, and he is mysti- 
fied as to the cause; the packers of corn and such special foods as 
lobster, and fishballs, find the contents spotted black and the juices 
are turned dark, and the mystery deepens; the packers of meats 
and fancy soups sometimes receive notice of ptomaine poisoning, 
where certain cans of their goods are held responsible, and they 
are totally in the dark as to the cause; bottlers of tomato catsup 
suddenly lose a large per cent, of their goods, where every detail 
of the work seems to have been carried on as in former years; 
picklers are surprised to find soft pickles, where their old and tried 
methods of salting have been followed closely. In fact there is 
hardly a single line of goods but that shows signs of spoilage at 
certain times under the most peculiar circumstances. Xow when 
this spoilage occurs there is something to blame, and if you have 
carefully watched your pack, you will have received warning of 
brew'ing trouble. A can will swell and you pick it up, turn it over 
and look for a possible leak; the capping and tipping are smooth: 
the top and bottom appear all right, but the seam looks as though 
there might be a leak, and you pass over the matter: this may be 
a warning that the process is wrong, and if you let the matter drop 
you may find out suddenly that a large per cent, of your goods are 
going wrong. When a can shows signs of swelling a thorough 
bacteriological examination ought to be made at once. If the can 
is only a leak, there will be found growinoc inside various germs, 
which would have been destroyed in a single boiling process, and 
this would be fairly conclusive evidence that there was a leak 
somewhere in the can, possibly so small as to escape the most rigid 
scrutiny. If the can is a swell caused by an underprocess, the 
plate culture method will show only spore-bearing species of bac- 



PRINCiPLES OP BACTERIOLOGICAL TECHNIQUE. 73 

teria, and if this be the case, the process must be examined care- 
fully; first, to see if everything is in good working order; second, 
a careful test of thermometers and gauges ; and third, to see if the 
processor is giving the goods the required time and temperature. 
If all these are found to be correct, then cans must be inoculated 
with pure cultures of the bacteria and then incubated at 98° F. If 
they swell they show insufficient sterilization. Sometimes the cans 
do not swell, but still contain germs, which will decompose the 
sugar into acid, which phenomenon is known among canners as 
"sour goods," so it is well to cut open a few cans and streak some 
Petri dishes containing nutrient agar and gelatin, and put part of 
these in the anaerobic culture apparatus, and others are to be grown 
in the incubator, covered, but allowing circulation of atmosphere. 
Hanging drops of the liquid in the cans should be made and care- 
fully watched under a 1-12 oil immersion lens. If living bacteria 
are numerous, they mav be seen to move rapidly througli the 
fluid. 

Nearly all the spore bearing bacteria are motile, possessing, 1 
usually, numerous flagella, which we have reproduced in various 
photomicrographs throughout this work. As we have previously 
stated, the flagella are not visible when examining living bacteria ; 
they are seen only after staining according to special methods' 
which we will describe later in this chapter. 

The preparation of nutrient media for cultivating bacteria is 
essential for bacteriological research and for general purposes the 
following formulae are used, but for special study the best nutrient 
materials are made with the fluids of such goods as are spoiling: 
for instance, the bacteria found in spoiled peas should be grown 
upon the sterilized juice of peas, or if it be spoiled corn, the medium 
should contain as a base the filtered sweet corn juice, etc. 



ORDINARY MEDIA. 

BOUILLON. This is made from fresh lean meat juice and is 
used generally to demonstrate certain peculiarities of various species, 
to di liferent iate species, and aid in their identification. Sometimes 
the bouillon is densely clouded, sometimes only slightly; a thick 
sediment may form, and this precipitate may be easily diffused by 
shaking, or may be too heavy ; some cultures form pellicles or skins 
over the surface, and these may be easily broken (by shaking the 
tube) or may be very tenacious. The indol reaction with sulphuric 
acid is best demonstrated in a bouillon culture. Bouillon is an ex- 
cellent medium for growing the various germs which produce pto- 
maines and toxins: the germs may be filtered out by forcing the 
liquid through a porcelain, or Chamberland filter, and the analysis 
may be made of the filtrate for such poisons. Bouillon cultures 



74 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

are made of the various germs whicli are used in agglutination 
tests, described under Typhoid, in Chapter V. 

FORMULA. 500 grammes (about 17 ounces) of lean beef 
are cut up into small pieces ; there must be no free fat ; the meat is 
covered with j,ooo cubic centimeters, or one litre (about one 
quart), of distilled water, and let stand in refrigerator 24 hours. 
Squeeze out all the juice possible from the meat and strain through 
flannel, or, better still, gently simmer over flame for one hour, and 
then strain. The flame should not come directlv in contact with 
the bottom of the enameled pan, so a sheet of asbestos is placed 
between the flame and the pan or one with a double bottom may 
be used. If, after this, the volume is short of 1,000 c.c, add 
enough distilled water to make up the amount, then add 10 gram- 
mes of Merck's meat peptone and 5 grammes of common salt. Put 
the mixture into the autoclav or process retort and raise the tem- 
perature very slowly up to 240° F. and hold for 30 minutes; after 
removing, strain through four thicknesses of flannel and let stand 
until cold, then filter through ordinary filtering paper. Test the 
bouillon with blue litmus paper and it changes the color to red, 
wliich shows an acid reaction. As most bacteria grow better on 
slightly alkaline media, prepare a strong solution of carbonate_of 
soda and stir into the bouillon, just enough to turn red litmus pa- 
per shghtly blue. Care must be taken not to add too much alkali, 
for in the preparation of agar it is almost impossible to obtain a 
clear filtrate. 

The bouillon is now a beautiful golden color and clear. A 
number of tubes can be filled about one-fourth full and the balance 
filled into Florentine flasks for future use. The necks must be 
stuflfed with tightly twisted absorbent cotton, and all the tubes and 
flasks then put into the autoclav and sterilized for thirty minutes 
at 240°F. ; then after removing they must be kept in a dark place 
so that no sunlight shall strike them. As mentioned in last chap- 
ter, strong sunlight will cause the formation of dioxygen, formalde- 
hyde and traces of other antiseptics, through the oxidation of 
sugars and fats. 

Dextrose and Milk Sugar Bouillon may be made by adding 2 
per cent, of either to the bouillon. This combination is used to 
demonstrate biological peculiarities of various bacteria towards 
sugar. In the same manner and for the same purpose, Glycerin 
Bouillon is made by adding 4 per cent, glycerin to ordinary bouil- 
lon. Carbolic acid is added to bouillon; 6 per cent, of a 5 per cent. 
solution of carbolic acid will retard the growth of undesired bac- 
teria, and is used in the isolation of certain germs found grow- 
ing with very many diflferent species, which under ordinary cir- 
cumstances grow too luxuriantly, and crowd out the species sought. 



PRINCIPLES OF BACTERIOLOGICAL TECHNIQUE. 75 

SOLID NUTRIENT MEDIA. 

To Dr. Koch of Berlin belongs the credit of this valuable 
discovery: that nutrient bases could be solidified in gelatin and 
agar-agar, and that bacteria, when mixed throughout the mass, 
would grow and form colonies of their own kind, and would not 
extend very far (if sufficiently separated) to become mixed. By 
means of this class of media nearly all pure cultures are obtained. 
If Pasteur had taken advantage of this valuable method in his time, 
a great part of his labors would have been made easy, and the 
science of bacteriology would have made grcciter progress than it 
has, although wonderful discoveries have been made, yet the possi- 
bilities are almost unlimited. Outside of electricity, we believe that 
there is no science which has the possibilities that lie within the 
range of the bacteriolgist. There are a number of diseases, the 
cause of which is still mysterious, there being no definite organism 
known to be responsible; there are smallpox, scarlatina, yellow 
fever, foot and mouth diseases, rhinderpest, sy|)hilis, and many 
other diseases w^hich have not been traced positively to specific 
micro-organisms, and there are a number of cases of spoilage in 
foodstuffs which have never been investigated, so that we cannot 
help regretting that Pasteur did not give us at least twenty years 
advancement by using solid nutrient media in his time. We owe 
to this great genius much of our present knowledge, but how much 
more he might have discovered with solid nutrient media to facili- 
tate his labor is only a matter of speculation. 

GELATIN MEDIA. Make the same quantity of bouillon as 
previously given, leaving out the peptone and salt; pour over this 
ICO grammes of fine gelatin, lo grammes of peptone, and 5 gram- 
mes of common salt. Dissolve these by placing pan in boiling 
water, and after they are thoroughly mixed make slightly alkaline, 
as directed under **bouillon." Place the solution in the filtering 
apparatus (Xovy's), attach suction pump and filter, or filter through 
four thicknesses of flannel if you have no other means. The liquid 
is then poured into tubes and Florentine flasks stoppered with cot- 
ton and sterilized at 2i2°F. for one hour on three successive davs. 
If it is desired, Petri dishes may be placed in the autoclav and 
sterilized at the same time, and these may be filled with the gelatin 
medium. When sterilizing Petri dishes I have found it wise to 
turn both tops and bottoms upside down in wire basket, which 
prevents the accumulation of condensed water, so undesirable. The 
gelatin will harden if placed in a temperature below 75°F., so the 
best method is to place it in a refrigerator. Since gelatin melts at 
about 75°F., it cannot be used advantageously in hot weather, but 
in cold weather is advantageous, because it is very clear, is easily 
prepared, and the colonies of bacteria grown on it have more char- 
acteristic peculiarities than on agar. 



76 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

Special preparations may be made with gelatin by adding 
grape sugar, milk sugar, glycerin or carbolic acid, as directed un- 
der **bouillon/' 

Solid culture media can be made by using gelatin with the 
juices of fruits, vegetables and the liquid or special food prepara- 
tions. Usually lo per cent, gelatin will be found sufficient. 

These special gelatin preparations have great value in the 
study of food spoilage, because the organisms in pure cultures will 
produce the very changes so often observed in spoiled canned goods, 
while in the regular meat juice gelatin these special characteristics 
mav not be revealed. 

For the cultivation of the heat loving bacteria, the lactic group, 
and many pathogenic species, gelatin is not very satisfactory, since 
it cannot be incubated, but for the demonstration of liquefying bac- 
teria it is fine, and furnishes means of differentiating species, where 
agar and even blood serum fail to reveal this characteristic. 



AGAR-AC.VR MKDFA. 

AGAR-AGAR is prepared from a seaweed which grows on 
the coast of China and Japan, and is used in the place of gelatin, 
over which it has many advantages. It is more difficult to prepare, 
however, and considerable time and care must l>e given it to pro- 
duce a good clear medium. Formula : The meat juice is prepared 
as directed under the head of ''Bouillon," and lo grammes of pep- 
tone and 5 grammes of salt are added, as directed under ''Gelatin,*' 
but instead of gelatin i to 2 per cent, agar is used. The agar is cut 
up quite fine, and thoroughly washed after being weighed. Place 
the pan in the autoclav and slowly raise the temperature to 240- F., 
maintaining same for about 10 minutes: then lower the pressure 
and filter the fluid through Xovy's agar api)aratus, having previous- 
ly made the liquor slightly alkaline with sodiu!ii carbonate solution, 
using great care not to add too much to avoid cloudiness. Xovy's 
apparatus gives a clear, golden filtrate, which is beautifully trans- 
parent after solidification. Flasks and tubes are filled as directed 
under "Gelatin.'' and these, with the desired number of Petri dishes, 
are placed in the autoclav and sterilized at 240 ''F. for 35 minutes. 
The agar does not solidify until the temperature falls to I02^F.. 
and the tubes mav be slanted bv lavinsf them down so that the liouid 
agar will flow up towards the cc^tton pretty well : by raising the 
mouth of the tube, anv desired slant mav be obtained. The Petri 
dishes are filled while the agar is still hot. There is always con- 
siderable condensation water left on the surface of solidified agar, 
and to minimize this the temperature of the dishes should be about 
the same as that of the agar when it is poured out. After as^ar 
has solidified it does not melt again except at high temperature. 



PRINCIPLES OF BACTERIOLOGICAL TECHNIQUE. 77 

thus it has the advantage over gelatin, in that it may be kept at 
blood temperature in the incubator. There are a number of bac- 
teria which require this temperature for characteristic growth. Agar 
is the best medium for growing motile bacteria which are to be 
stained to demonstrate their flagella. Bacteria, when grown on 
gelatin or in fluids, carry with them so much of the medium upon 
which they are growing that the flagella cannot be stained properly. 
Various combinations of agar are made for special cultures, 
such as those described under **Gelatin." Chemicals, such as sac- 
charate of iron or tartrate of iron, may be added to agar to demon- 
strate the production of sulphuretted hydrogen by certain species 
of bacteria; lactose and sterilized litmus tincture are sometimes 
added to demonstrate the ability of certain species to cause fer- 
mentation of lactose and the production of acids. Agar may be 
streaked with sterilized blood to cultivate special bacteria. In fact 
agar is the best nutrient medium for general purposes. 

POTATO MEDIA. The growth of many species of bacteria 
on potato is often of great value in assisting the bacteriologist to 
identify them. Owing to the very resistant forms of germ life 
found naturally on potatoes, it is difficult to prepare sterile media. 
There are three varieties of bacteria found growing on the surface 
which will withstand considerable boiling to destroy the spores; 
they are Mesentericus vulgatus, Mesentericus fuscus and Mesenter- 
icus ruber, the spores of the latter being able to withstand six to 
ten hours' boiling. To prepare potatoes, they must be thoroughly 
washed in water and the eyes removed, then sterilized in the auto- 
clav for fifteen minutes at 240^F. Before they are removed, the 
hands should be washed in a bi-chlorid of mercurv solution, i to 
1,000. and a sterilized knife may be used to cut the potatoes in 
halves lengthwise. Place the pieces, cut side u]), in culture dishes 
having filter paper in the bottoms. The filter pa]>er should be wet 
with the mercury solution, to prevent contamination. The surface 
of the potato may then be streaked with the pure culture of the 
bacteria. This work may be simplified by cutting the potatoes into 
slices and sterilizing in autoclav for twenty minutes at 250°F., and 
then transferring into sterile Petri dishes. 

Potato juice may be combined with agar 1V2 per cent., or 
gelatin 10 per cent., and a small quantity of i per cent, solution 
iodide of potassium, and sterilized thirty minutes at 240° P. This 
is an excellent medium for growing the typhoid bacilli, because it 
is slightly acid, and the bacilli form threads which have a beautiful 
serpentine movement. 

MILK MEDIA. Milk is used to demonstrate the power of 
coagulation of certain bacteria, also to show whether they produce 
acids or alkalis, or whether their action is amphoteric. Milk is 
difficult to sterilize, owing to the presence of spore-bearing bacteria. 



78 CANNING AND PRESERVING OP FOOD PRODUCTS. 

which are very resistant to heat. Too much heat changes the 
chemical composition of milk, so that when boiled at 212'^F., citrate 
of lime is deposited or precipitated, and there are formed such 
antiseptics as formaldehyde and peroxid of hydrogen. The milk 
fresh from the cow, taken under aseptic precautions, is best, be- 
cause it may thus be obtained almost free from bacteria. Fill the 
milk into sterile tubes, plug them with cotton, and heat to 160° F. 
for one hour for five successive days, keeping same always in a 
temperature not to exceed 70^ F. 

Tincture of litmus added to milk until slightly blue, before ster- 
ilizing, is very useful in determining the acid producing power of 
certain species of bacteria. The formation of acid will change 
the color to pink or red. 

For most purposes, milk put into test tubes and sterilized for 
fifty minutes at 250°F., will prove satisfactory; the chemical alter- 
ations are not so great as to interfere with the study of non-patho- 
genic bacteria. Milk is not a good medium for growing bacteria* 
except for the purpose indicated, because it is not transparent and 
if solidified by adding gelatin or agar and used for plate cultures, 
the colonies of bacteria are very hard to find. The milk may be 
coagulated, however, and the clear fluid used with peptone and 
salt and solidified with 10 per cent, gelatin, or 2 per cent, agar, and 
have value in the cultivation of bacteria associated with milk. 

BLOOD SERUM. This nutrient medium is valuable for 
growing ^•arious germs which produce ptomaines and toxins. The 
power of liquefying solidified serum is useful for identification of 
species. The blood is taken from the animal under aseptic precau- 
tions and allowed to stand one day in refrigerator, when the serum 
may be drawn off and filled into tubes. The serum w'ill be stenle 
if due care has been exercised. Tubes of serum may be sterilized 
in Koch's blood serum sterilizer one hour at i^o^F. for five sue- 
cessive days. They may be solidified in Koch's apparatus for soli- 
difying blood serum by heating to ijo^F. 

' BREAD MEDIA FOR CULTIVATING MOLDS, Bread, 
when made moist, is acid in reaction, and is a nutrient medium for 
molds : bacteria do not grow well on acid media, so the isolation of 
various species of Hyphomycetes is made easier, because acid is 
favorable for their growth. Fine bread crumbs are collected in 
the bottoms of several test tubes and sterilized water is added, suffi- 
cient to make a paste. The tubes are sterilized by boiling for three 
successive days at 2T2°F. for fifteen minutes. 

METHOD OK MAKIXG CULTURHS. 

Tn order to determine the different species of bacteria which 
are causing spoilage or disease, it is necessary to separate them one 
from another and study them in pure cultures. It rarely happens 



PRINCIPLES OF BACTERIOLOGICAL TECHNIQUE. 79 

that one species is found alone; there are usually various kinds of 
bacteria growing together, and to separate them requires careful 
manipulation, which is easily accomplished by practice, and aseptic 
precautions. If we desire to cultivate the various bacteria found in 
a can of sour goods, we proceed as follows: A bunsen flame is 
forced down on to the surface of the tin, and a sterilized awl is put 
into the flame and pushed through the tin ; if any air is sucked into 
the can by a vacuum, it is sterilized in the flame which covers the 
hole; a long platinum looped wire is then heated to incandescence 
and put down into the can through the hole and quickly with- 
drawn, and the loopful of material is transferred to liquefied gelatin 
and agar tubes and dishes, previously prepared as follows : The 
gelatin tubes are liquefied in warm water, and after singeing the 
cotton plug in the flame, tube Xo. i is inoculated by holding tube 
in slanting position in left hand, removing cotton plug with little 
finger of right hand, and then rubbing up the loopful of material 
on one side of the tube, mixing it with the gelatin ; the plug is then 
put in and the gelatin mixed thoroughly by rolling and gentle shak- 
ing. The platinum loop is then sterilized in flame and tube Xo. 2 
is inoculated from X'o. i, both being held in a slanting position in 
left hand and the plugs of each removed in succession with little 
finger of right hand. Two or three loopfuls of gelatin from Xo. i 
are transferred to X'o. 2, and the plugs replaced ; the gelatin in X^o. 
2 is then shaken, the platinum loop sterilized as before, and in the 
same manner tube Xo. 3 is inoculated with two or three loopfuls 
from No. 2. After shaking and mixing thoroughly, all three are 
poured into sterilized Petri dishes and placed in refrigerator or on 
ice to solidifv the gelatin, after which they are maintained at about 
70^F. 

In like manner a number of tubes are inoculated and placed 
in the anaerobic culture apparatus after chilling. It usually hap- 
pens that Xo. I and X'o. 2 have too many colonies, which cannot 
successfully be separated before they grow together, but Xo. 3 usu- 
ally contains but few colonies, which may be studied carefully as to 
color, shape, size and border, also the liquefaction of gelatin, if any 
occurs. Observations must be made and noted of their appearance 
in natural size, then of their appearance under various magnifica- 
tions. 

Agar plate or Petri dish cultures are made in the same man- 
ner, except that the agar is melted first in autoclav at 240°F.. and 
then poured into tubes. The agar solidifies at I02°P., so this must 
be borne in mind and the work must be done quickly, at about 

I20°F. 

Gelatin is difficult to manipulate in hot weather, and cannot 
be incubated, so it is advisable to make cultures on agar as well 
as gelatin. Tlie writer has been successful in isolating the various 



80 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

species in Petri dishes alone, without using the tubes, as follows : 
The agar is liquefied and poured into the sterilized dishes, and just 
before it begins to harden transfers are made by mixing a loopful 
of the suspected material in dish No. i, using a long platinum loop- 
ed wire and holding the lid of the dish up from the edge just high 
enough to permit thorough mixing. By a gentle swaying motion 
the mixing can be made uniform. Transfers are then made to a 
second and a third dish, as described in method of inoculating 
tubes, the platinum loop being sterilized between each transfer. Dish 
No. I will usually have too many colonies, which will grow to- 
gether before they are old enough to sliow special characteristics; 
No. 2 may be better, but No. 3 will probably contain but few 
colonies, which may be carefully studied jand transfers made to new 
dishes, which are streaked by pushing a sterilized platinum loop 
into a colony (or if the colony is very small, a needle is better), 
and the surface of the new dish is streaked by simply drawing the 
wire over the surface. Some care is required in handling Petri 
dishes; if. there be any water of condensation either on the surface 
of the agar or on the under side of the cover, it should be set to 
one side and not used until this evaporates. Freshly made agar 
usually has considerable water of condensation and it is well to use 
only that which has stood in flasks long enough to show only slight 
traces, although dishes may be filled with fresh agar and allowed 
to stand until the surface is dry and no drops of water are visible 
on the under surface of the cover. 

\\'hen material under investigation contains only a few scat- 
tered bacteria, which may be ascertained by examination of hang- 
ing drops, Petri dishes may be streaked without the necessity of 
liquefying the agar; the loop is sterilized and plunged into the ma- 
teria] and the surface of several dishes streaked without sterilizing 
the platinum during the inoculations. The first one or two may 
not be freely distributed, but others will contain colonies here and 
there which are pure cultures, and these may be transferred to fresh 
dishes. Pure cultures will remain alive for months, and in some 
cases for years, in test tubes sealed and protected with rubber caps, 
or if plugged with sterilized cotton and sealed with wax (having 
previously moistened the surface of the cotton with corrosive subli- 
mate.) ^lold destroys many cultures: it starts to grow in the cot- 
ton and will often grow through it, down along the inside of the 
tube for several inches, until it reaches the nutrient material. It is 
well to make fresh transfers of cultures which are desired to be 
kept, at least once in three weeks. 

As it is necessary to cultivate bacteria in the absence of oxygen, 
a special apparatus is desirable, one employed for such purpose (by 
Novy) is w^orthy of special mention, since it may be used with

hydrogen or the pyrogaliate method for both tube and plate cul- 
tures. 

For very fine work, hydrogen is preferable to any other gas 
for anaerobic cultures, for the reason that other gases permeate 
the cultnre media to a certain extent and have some influence on 
the growth of delicate organisms. The cost and trouble connected 
with this method are too great for ordinary work, so the pyrogal- 
iate method is generally employed, which may be described as fol- 
lows : The test tubes are put into apparatus in upright position on a 



Fig. 28 

wire rest, which fits in glass cylinder about two inches above the 
bottom; on this wire the Petri dishes may be placed also; before 
sealing, a quantity of pyrogaliic acid and a 1-16 dilution of normal 
potassium hydroxid, or caustic potash, are put into the bottom of 
the apparatus so that the liquid will be a litie over one inch deep. 
The pyrogaliate formula is, one part pyrogaliic acid and ten parts 
of a 1-16 normal caustic potash solution. (A normal solution con- 
tains about seven grammes to 125 cubic centimeters of water.) The 
apparatus must be sealed quickly, and the glass stop-cock at the top 
shut off, so that there will be a complete absorption of the oxygen 
within the chamber. The apparatus may lie placed in the incubator 
or may be left at room temperature, according to the nature of the 
organisms under investigation. In this manner it may be demon- 
strated if a given species of bacteria is strictly anaerobic or whether 
it is facultative anaerobic. 

In canned goods which have soured, there are frequently found 
strictly anaerobic bacteria growing along with other species which 
are aerobic by nature. The can contains oxygen after every ster- 
ilizing process, and this oxygen Js used up by the aerobic bacteria, 
and then the anaerobic varieties begin to grow, where the steriliza- 
tion has not been complete. This is a common phenomenon and 
explains our failures sometimes in isolating living bacteria from 
cans of sour goods, where the anaerobic apparatus is not employed. 
In the natural putrefactive processes going on in the free atmos- 



82 CANNING AND PRESERVING OP FOOD PRODUCTS. 

I phere the anaerobic bacteria depend upon the aerobes to use up all 
/ the oxygen, while they remain dormant until there is a favorable 
condition of environment for their growth. 

STAINING, — When living bacteria are viewed through the 
microscope, in order to see them well, a 1-12 oil immersion lens 
must be used and the result is not very satisfactory so far as the 
size and general characteristics are concerned. If the bacteria are 
motile this may be learned, but it is hard to follow an actively 
motile bacillus, for it is in focus usually only an instant, and then 
it is necessary to use the fine adjustment to bring it into focus 
again, which often fails. Non-motile organisms are clumped usu- 
ally, but owing to the great transparency of bacteria the study of 
the living unstained germs is not very satisfactory. 

The art of staining has enabled the bacteriologist to deter- 
mine in many instances the kind and class. Many bacteria have 
peculiarities in their staining properties, and these peculiarities help 
the student. There are certain staining methods which fail with 
some species and the staining of flagella often aids the worker in 
determining the species by the number and character of the flagella 
of motile organisms. There are some motile bacteria which seem 
to possess no flagella, and it is thought that their motility is achiev- 
ed by an undulating membrane attached to them, (I have never 
seen any motile bacilli without flagella), and the absence of flagella 
from the cell of a motile organism can be ascertained only by nega- 
tive results in staining. Some bacteria are surrounded by a cap- 
sule, which is brought out by staining. Spores are easily located 
within the cells by their resistance to staining; the cell stains well, 
but leaves the bright spore almost transparent within the cell mem- 
brane. The spores themselves are stained by special methods and 
the rest of the rod may be stained with a different colored dye, 
which produces a beautiful effect in permanent mounts. 

The first step in staining is to have clean cover-glasses (cover- 
glasses are either round or square pieces of glass only about i-ioo 
to 1-200 of an inch thick.) which are sold in small boxes holding 
half an ounce. The cover-glasses are covered usually with a fatty 
substance, which is removed with difficulty. This fat is removed 
by soaking a number in sulphuric acid for a day or two. then wash- 
ing with caustic soda or potash, and then further cleaned by a mix- 
ture of alcohol and ammonia. (See also method of cleaning cover- 
glasses described under flagella staining). Tt is well to keep 
cover-glasses in absolute alcohol in a bottle with ground glass stop- 
per to avoid evaporation. Jtist before using they are lifted out of 
the alcohol one at a time, and drierl with clean linen free from 
fat. then passed quickly through a flame. Tf allowed to get too 
hot the edges melt down or the shape changes either concave or 
convex, which is undesirable, or the glass flies all to pieces, which 



PRINCIPLES OF BACTERIOLOGICAL TECHNIQUE. 83 

is often the case, but may be overcome by quick work. "A small 
drop of distilled water is placed in the center of the glass, and a 
small speck of material containing germs is mixed with the drop, 
care being taken not to have too many germs; the drop is then 
evenly spread over the whole surface, and if the glass be clean this 
will be done easily. Should the fluid collect in small droplets, it 
indicates that the cover-glass is not clean, and the process of clean- 
ing the cover-glass must be gone over again so that the fluid will 
spread evenly over the entire surface. For convenience in handling, 
the cover-glass is held in a small forceps. (One devised by Novy 
for this purpose is very good.) The fluid is allowed to dry onto 
the glass by evaporation, or may be hastened by waving in the 
air. When absolutely dry it is fixed by passing through the Bunsen 
flame three times quickly, keeping specimen side away from actual 
contact with the flame. The bacteria are thus firmly fixed on the 
glass, so that they will not wash away when the staining is done. 
A small drop of water is then placed on the specimen side, and al- 
lowed to spread over the surface, and then the glass is flooded 
with an aqueous solution of dye, such as carbol fuchsin, methylene 
blue, gentian violet. Bismarck brown, etc. The glass holding the 
rounded drop of color is held about three inches over the flame 
and heated until vapor is seen to rise, and this is maintained for 
several minutes, care being exercised to avoid actual ebullition. It 
is not a good plan to force the staining by too much heat ; the best 
results are obtained by gentle heating for a longer time, and if 
the stain is allowed to cool before using water to wash excess 
away, the danger of cell shrinkage is minimized. After washing 
off the excess of stain, a few drops of diluted alcohol will clear 
up the field, but it must be washed off at once; then take a clean 
glass slide and place the cover-glasses on it, specimen side down, 
removing excess of water by filter paper, and dry the upper sur- 
face ; now place a small drop of cedar oil on center of cover-glass ; 
put slide under microscope; bring down 1-12 objective until it 
touches the oil and bring into focus with fine adjustment. If the 
specimen is all right the cover-s:lass may be floated off by water 
and allowed to dry in air or by touching edge to filter paper, wav- 
ing in air, etc.. and when dry it may be cleared by flooding both 
sides with xylol, then turned edge down on filter paper and finally 
held about twelve inches above flauie until dry. To mount cover- 
glass, take a clean slide, warm over flame until all moisture is 
forced away, then place a small drop of Canada balsam dissolved 
in xylol in the center. (Xylol balsam is put up in tubes all pre- 
pared for use. A small drop may be squeezed out of the tube onto 
the slide, experience teaching just the required amount.) The 
slide is again held over flame to drive away all mosture, and the 
cover-glass is also warmed and placed, specimen side down, upon 



84 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

the drop of balsam, and may be pressed down firmly by laying a 
sheet of filter paper over it, or by using a cork of the same diameter. 
There should be only enough balsam to fill up space, but it often 
happens that some excess will be squeezed out; this will harden 
eventually and will cause no inconvenience unless it is too excessive, 
in which case it may be removed with a little xylol and clean linen. 
Many microscopists have trouble in obtaining clear work on 
account of moisture on the slide or cover-glass during the mounting, 
so I wish to call particular attention to the perfect drying of both 
slide and cover-glass before using the xylol for clearing. 

METHOD OF OBTAINING AND STAINING CONTACT 
SPECIMENS. — This method is used to show the "Swarming Is- 
lands" of such bacteria as Proteus Vulgaris, Proteus Mirabilis and 
Proteus Zenkeri, which are shown in plates. 

The colonies are gi'own on gelatin, and when the bacilli begin 
to swarm and branch off from the parent colony a cover-glass is 
dropped carefully over a colony and gently pressed; it is then 
lifted straight up, avoiding any lateral movement, and dried in the 
air, then stained as directed in the ordinary method. If the colonies 
show liquefaction, contact specimens cannot be made. 

gram's method 01? STAINING. 

This method of staining is used to differentiate the species. 
There are a great many bacteria which do not retain the stain, 
while others having great resemblance take the stain readily. The 
age of the culture and the medium upon which it grows have some- 
thing to do with the results. 

METHOD. 

1. The cover-glass specimen is stained for a few minutes with 
Ehrlich's anilin-water gentian violet. (Anilin oil=4 c.c.-j- water 
loo c.c.-j-ii c.c. of concentrated alcohol solution of gentian violet.) 

2. Wash with water and use Gram's solution of iodin (iodin 
crystals i gramme+iodide of potash 2 grammes+ water 300 c.c.) 
until the stained surface blackens, which requires about half a min- 
ute. 

3. Wash with alcohol until excess color is removed. Then the 
specimen may be examined under the microscope to ascertain if 
the bacteria have taken the stain. 

METHOD OF STAINING TUBERCLE BACILLI. 

The tubercle bacilli are found frequently, and often in large 
numbers, in fresh milk and also in butter. The method of staining 
here given is used to demonstrate the bacilli from phthisical pati- 



PRINCIPLES OF BACTERIOLOGICAL TECHNIQUE. 85 

ents and is applied to the sputum, which is carefully spread over 
the surface of a cover-glass, air dried and fixed in flame as in ordi- 
nary method. Tubercle sputum is easily obtained, and the stain- 
ing of the bacilli affords excellent practice for the beginner. 

For examining milk and butter a centrifugal machine is used 
to obtain a sediment, which is more apt to show the presence of 
consumption germs than a small quantity taken at random. 

The suspected milk is put into the bottles and the machine is 
used for a few minutes, the fluid is poured off and the cover-glass 
is spread with some of the sediment. If butter be suspected, a 
small quantity is put into a test tube about three-fourths full of 
water, which is then heated in water to melt the fat. The tube is 
thoroughly shaken and put on ice to solidify the fat, after which 
the fluid is put into the centrifugal machine, the same as described 
for milk, and a cover-glass spread is made of the sediment. The 
cover-glass thus prepared w^ill contain too much fat, so it must be 
air dried and heated slightly, and laid in a mixture of ether and 
alcohol (i to 3) for a few seconds, then removed, air dried, fixed 
in flame and stained as follows : 

The cover-glass is flooded with Ziehl-Neelsen's carbol-fuchsin 
(fuchsin I gramme-f alcohol 10 c.c.-f water 100 c.c.-fcarbolic acid 
5 grammes), and heated over flame until vapor arises and set to 
one side. Repeat three or four times ; wash off excess of stain with 
water and decolorize with a twenty per cent, solution of sulphuric 
acid and wash acid off with water. If still too red, use sulphuric 
acid again. When washed the specimen should be pink. The 
cover-glass is then flooded with Loefller's methylene blue (concen- 
trated alcohol solution of methylene blue 30 c.c.+ watery solution 
of caustic potash 1:10,000 — 100 c.c), and heated for a few sec- 
onds, then w^ashed under the water tap until all excess color is re- 
moved. The tubercle bacilli will be stained a deep red, and the 
surrounding field will be blue, which makes a beautiful contrast. 

Since one-seventh of the population of the world die from con-'l 
sumption, this disease germ is most interesting for study and bac- 
terioloe:ical investigation. It is transmitted from one person to an- 
other in various ways, by breathine particles of floating matter 
containing the bacilli in the homes of consumptives, in public con- 
veyances and buildings, and in articles of food, such as milk and 
butter. It is not hereditary. The germs are destroyed at 2i2°F.. 
and there is dangler only in such foods as are consumed in an un- 
cooked state. Pasteurization destroys them in milk, and this meth- 
od of treatinef milk and cream intended for butter-making is to be 
highly commended.

Bacillus Tuberculosis^ Koch (1882) 

TUBERCLE BACILLUS. 

Origin. — In tuberculosis of mammals; in lupis vulgaris. The bacillus 
of chicken tuberculosis is distinct from that of mammals. 

Form. — Rather long, very narrow rods, sinaller than the diameter of 
a blood cell. Are sometimes beaded. May be straight, but more fre- 
quently are slightly bent or nicked; distinctly rounded ends. Usually 
single, but sometimes forms short threads of three to six cells. It is fre- 
quently found in small bunches in the sputum, tissues, etc. It rarely 
occurs in branching form and with club-shaped ends. 

Motility. — Is not motile. 

Sporulaiion. — A number of bright bodies are frequently seen in the 
cell, but cannot be considered true spores. The bacillus is resistant to 
heat, dessication, acids, putrefaction, etc., in a relatively high degree. 

Oxygen Requirements. — It is a facultative anaerobe. Requires free 
access of oxygen for growth. 

Temperature. — Grows best at 37-39* C. Slight variations above or be- 
low this temperature will stop the growth. Will not grow at ordinary 
temperature. 

Behavior to Gelatin.— ^o growth at ordinary temperature. Does not 
peptonize blood-serum. 

Infection. — Takes place ordinarily along the respiratory tract — Inha- 
lation tuberculosis. It may occur through wounds — Inoculation tubercu- 
losis, also through food — Intestinal tuberculosis. The bacilli introduced 
into the intestines may localize in distant parts of the body.

METHOD OF STAINING SPORES OF SPORK-BEARING BACILU. 

The spores when free, or when fully formed within the bacilli, 
are very difficult to stain, but by heating the cover-glass specimen 
five or six times with carbol-fuchsin or gentian-violet, they will 
take the stain. The rods will decolorize in one minute in a 3 per 
cent, solution of HCL alcohol, and after washing they may be 
stained with methylene-blue, in contrast to the spores if fuchsin 
was used, or if the spores were stained with violet the rods may 
be stained with Bismarck-brown.

A SIMPLE METHOD OF MAKING PHOTOMICROGRAPHS. 

Methods Worked Out by the Author. 

Motile bacteria should be represented in illustrations just as 
they are naturally. The photomicrographs usually displayed in 
works on bacteriology do not as a rule represent motile bacteria 
as they should be. I, therefore, t(x>k up the study of staining these 
organisms and endeavored to discover a method which would give 
good results with all kinds of bacteria and I made a comparative 
studv. 

I have always obtained the best results with all species of bac- 
teria, excepting the anaerobic, by streaking the surface of 2 per 
cent, agar in Petri dishes, and the streaked culture should always

i be made from the young growth in bouillon and never from an agar 
or gelatin transfer. I usually inoculate a tube of bouillon the night 
before and streak the surface of the agar early on the following 
morning and then place the dishes in optimum temperature, so that 
I may get the most rapid growth possible. I find that 2 per cent, 
agar is preferable to that of less per cent., because the bacteria 
as a rule do not collect much debris from the culture media. Bac- 
teria differ widely in the number and character of fiieir flagella. 
Some are peritrichous, having large numbers growing out from 
' all parts of the cell; scMne are lophotrichous, having a bunch of 






Plate 18 Typhoid Bacilli, Flagellated 



flagella at one end; some are amphitrichous, having a flagellum 
at either end ; some are monotrichous, having a single terminal 
or polar flagellum. The flagella of different organisms vary in char- 
acter; some are extremely fine, so delicate that they stain with 
difficulty ; some are long and wavy ; others are short and may be 
almost straight. The anaerobic bacteria possess flagella which are 
extremely curly, and it is possible to determine from the character 
of its flagella whether an organism is an anaerobe or an aerobe. 
Many motile bacteria produce spiral bodies which are termed "Giant 
Whips" by Novy; some of these will reach 100^ in length. 

I found that the methods for flagella staining described by the 
old authors had to be modified considerably in order to get good 
results. By constant practice and very hard work, often prolonged 
into the small hours of the morning, I finally succeeded in my ef-

forts. I found there were six general classes of bacteria, each dif- 
ferent from the other, in its manner of growth, making- it neces- 
sary to treat each class in a different manner. I divided the motile 
bacteria into six classes for staining purposes: 

FIRST — bacilli which grow like the streaked culture of the 
Typhoid, such as Typhoid and Colon. 

SECOND— ha.cii\i which produce wrinkled or folded 
growths, such as Mesentericus fuscus. 

THIRD — bacilli which send out a thin, almost transparent 
growth over the surface of the agar, such as Bacillus Subtilis and 
Bacillus Megatherium. 



Plaw 19 Bacillus Meienlericiis Fuscus. Flagellated 



FOURTH — bacilli which produce slime, such as Bacillus Vul- 
gatus and Bacillus Viscosus. 

FIFTH — bacilli which produce pigments, such as Bacillus 
Prodigiosus and Bacillus Cyanogemis. 

SIXTH — anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacillus Tetanus, Oede- 
ma and Symptomatic Anthrax, etc.

MANNER OF MAKING SUSPENSIONS IN WATER. 

(i) Bacteria resembling Typhoid streak cultures have ver)* 
young and actively motile bacteria on the periphery of the growth. 
From this the material is taken and transferred to a large drop or 
two of distilled water which has previously been boiled. The plati- 
num loop should be made from very fine platinum wire, only about 
half the size of the loop used for general purposes. This fine loop 
will gather sufficient material without taking up any of the agar. 
The material usually clings tenaciously to the loop, but may be 
liberated by the aid of another platinum wire, if care is exercised. 
The bacteria are then allowed to disseminate spontaneously 
throughout the drop of water, so that the finest specimens will 
swim to the outer edges from which the cover-glass preparation 
is made. Bacteria which have few flagella and those whose flagella 
have been broken will remain near the center. 

(2) Preparations made from bacteria which produce wrink- 
led or folded growth are made before the wrinkled growth is 
formed. In order to get a good preparation from this group of 
bacteria the agar should be streaked in the morning and then care- 
fully watched for the first appearance of growth and from this a 
satisfactory preparation can be made. 

(3) The thin, transparent, spreading growth is one of the 
best for demonstrating flagella. This growth is almost invisible 
and is composed of very young and actively motile bacteria. In or- 
der to get a good preparation from this a curved platinum wire 
is used to gently collect the bacteria en masse and then the small 
loop is employed to make transfers to the distilled water. 

(4) The slime-producing bacteria are very difficult for the 
demonstration of flagella. The slime collects between the flagella 
and the mordant fixes the slime as well as the flagella, so that the 
stain completely covers the delicate organs of locomotion. I found 
that this slime could be precipitated by shaking a water suspension 
with chloroform. A very young growth of the organism is used 
and transfers are made to about i c.c. of distilled water in the test 
tube until the water is made very cloud v. The slime increases the 
cloudiness and this is necessary in order to have a sufficient number 
of bacteria to make a fine preparation. This cloudy suspension is 
then shaken with chloroform, which seems to cut away the slime 
from between the flagella : then the cover-glass preparation is made 
from the water above the chloroform. 

(5) Bacteria \Vhich produce pigments soluble in chloroform 
are treated in the same manner. Those whose pigments are soluble 
in water and not in chloroform are more difficult to stain. I usually 
hold the cover-glass under the tap after fixing the preparation in 



PRINCIPLES OF BACTERIOLOGICAL TECHNIQUE.

Plate 21 Bacillus Mesenlerkus Vulgatas, Flagellated 



PRINCIPLES OF BACTERIOLOGICAL TECHNIQUE. 93 

the flame previous to adding the mordant. In this way much of 
the soluble pigment is removed. 

(6) Good suspensions of anaerobic bacteria are the most dif- 
ficult of alPto obtain. Bacteria which are imbedded in stab cul- 
tures do not make good preparations, because the agar and debris 
cling tenaciously to the flagella. It is extremely difficult to get 
a good surface growth of obligative anaerobes, because it usually 
requires two or three drops of a young bouillon culture for surface 
inoculation and when the growth apj^ears the surface is covered 
with the old, partially dissolved cells and free sj)ores. Still, some 
very fine preparations can be made from the surface of the culture. 
The best results are obtained as follows: The medium is 2 per 
cent, glucose agar in slants and the inoculation is made back of the 
slant between the agar and the wall of the tube. I slide the needle 
down back of the slant and let it fall forward ; I introduce two or 
three drops of a young bouillon culture and then replace the agar. 
By excluding oxygen and maintaining a blood temperature for 
thirty-six hours, a fine growth of bacteria usually appears between 
the agar and the wall Of the tube and beautiful preparations can be 
made from this. Many rods containing spores still retain a full 
equipment of flagella. 



CLEANING THE COVER-GLASSES. 

I prefer the No. i round cover-glass, which when new are cov- 
ered with a thick, greasy substance quite difficult to remove. Cover- 
glasses used for the demonstration of flagella must be absolutely 
clean, and this is a most important feature. For removing the 
grease they are covered with suphuric acid and allowed to stand for 
one day. The sulphuric acid is poured off and they are then cov- 
ered with bichromate of potassium and allowed to remain in this for 
several hours. This acid is then poured off and the cover-glasses 
are washed with distilled water and transferred to a jar containing 
absolute alcohol, where they remain until ready for use. A single 
cover-glass is removed with clean forceps from the alcohol, trans- 
ferred to a piece of clean, well-washed linen and dried without 
touching it with the fingers. The cover-glass is then taken in the 
forceps and passed several times through the Bunsen flame, so 
that every particle of fat or grease is removed, and it must appear 
clear and free from blemishes. Many cover-glasses are lost after 
heating in the flame, particularly if there are any currents of cold 
air through the room, but since the perfect condition of the cover- 
glass is so important the loss of two or three is immaterial.

Bacillus Oedematis Malisrni, No. 2^ Novy (1893) 

Origin. — Obtained from guinea-pigs which had been inoculated with 
milk nuclein obtained from casein by digestion with artificial gastric juice. 

Form. — In the animal body it is usually found in single rods, four to 
five times as long as wide; also occurs in short threads. On artificial 
media the rods are straight or bent ; peculiarly twisted threads are some- 
times formed. The contents are frequently granular, showing a bright 
body at one end. 

Motility. — A slight, swaying motion, which is not always present. 
Possesses lateral flagella, and gives rise to giant whips 40 to 72 microns 
long in pure cultures as well as in the animal. 

Sporulation. — Has not been observed. 

Anilin Dyes. — Stain readily. Gram's method may be used. 

Growth. — Depends upon vitality. Grows rapidly when taken from an 
animal. 

Plates. — On glucose agar at 37° good colonies will develop in two 
or three days; these have irregular, fibrillated border, and frequently de- 
velop gas bubbles. Giant whips are sometimes found. 

Stab Culture. — Grows only in the lower part of the tube. In glucose 
agar properly alkaline, a distinctly visible growth develops along the 
line of inoculation ; gas is produced which soon tears apart the agar. The 
cultures soon die out. 

Streak Culture. — Grows on glucose agar only when oxygen is com- 
pletely excluded ; grows in the form of a white film, spreading over the 
surface. Involution forms develop on acid agar. 

Bouillon. — A fine growth is developed which settles to the bottom as 
a loose, flocculent sediment in twenty-four hours ; the liquid above be- 
coming clear. 

Glucose Gelatin colored with litmus. — Liquefies and produces acid. 
The litmus is reduced and turned red. 

Oxygen Requirements. — It is an ohlicrative anaerobe. Will grow in 
vacuum hydrogen, nitrogen, carbonic acid and illuminating gas. 

Temperature. — Does not grow below 25'' C. Grows best at about 39** 
Will withstand freezing for twenty-four hours. 

Behavior to Gelatin. — Liquefies. 

Aero genesis. — Produces ga«es in alkaline media. Forms volatile acids. 
as butyric acids, etc.. in artificial cultures and also in the body of rabbits. 

Attenuation. — Cultures lose their virulence when exposed to light or 
left in hydrogen. Can be kept in the dark or by passing through animals. 
Lost virulence may be restored by inoculation with a mixed culture con- 
taining Proteus vulgaris. 

Immunity. — Ts not produced by non-fatal inoculation, or by old 
weakened cultures, or by the serous exudate of the pleural cavity. 

Pathogenesis. — Subcutaneous injection of Va: c. c. of hydrogen bouillon 
cultures will kill gninea-pigs. white rats, white mice, rabbits or doves, 
in twelve to twenty-four hour*;. Marked subcutaneous edema are present. 
Serous exudates in thoracic and abdominal cavities. Cover-glass prepara- 
tions made from subcutaneous tissue or serous surfaces usually show 
very large numbers of bacilli; giant whips are also frequently present, be- 
ing visible as colorless spirals. 

Diagnosis. — It is readily distineuished from symptomatic anthrax and 
malignant edema by morphological chiracteri sties.

PREPARATION OF THE STAINING AGENTS. 

The fixing agent is mordant and the stain is carbol gentian 
violet or preferably carbol fuchsine. 

THE MORDANT. 

2 grams dessicated tannic acid. 

5 grams cold saturated solution ferrous sulphate (aqueous). 

15 c.c. distilled water. 

I c.c. saturated alcoholic solution of fuchsine. 

The tannic acid is dissolved in the water first, by the applica- 
tion, of gentle heat; then the ferrous sulphate and then the alco- 
holic solution of fuchsine are added. 

To these ingredients, I have always found it advisable to add 
a certain amount of sodium hydroxid, a i per cent, solution, varying 
from ^ to I c.c. The best grade of filter paper is used for filter- 
ing the mordant, and there should be left a heavy precipitate. Af- 
ter filtering, the color of this mordant should be of a reddish-brown 
hue, not clear, but somewhat cloudy, and this mordant must be 
used within five hours after it is made. After that time, it loses its 
staining power. This is indicated by its gradual clarification and 
darkened color. It gives the best results when strictly fresh, and 
accomplishes its work in a much shorter time, so that very little if 
any heating is required when it is placed on the cover-glass prep- 
aration. 

CARBOL FUCHSINE. 

Take about one gram of granulated fuchsine (not the acid 
fuchsine), put it in a bottle, and pour over it about 25 c.c. of warm 
absolute alcohol. Shake vigorously, and let it stand for several 
hours before using. The carbol fuchsine is made by diluting the 
saturated alcoholic solution four or five times with a 5 per cent, 
solution of carbolic acid. Carbol fuchsine should be freshly made, 
heated and filtered before using. 

Every organism differs from other organisms in its manner 
of absorbing the stain, so that some experimental work is necessary 
to determine just how the stain should be applied. In a general 
way we proceed as follows : A small loop full of the clouded wa- 
ter, obtained as described in the first part of this article, is trans- 
ferred to the cover-glass and gently spread over as large a sur- 
face as possible. Care must be exercised in spreading the drop. I 
usually carry the drop around the surface without touching the 
glass with the loop. In this way the surface is moistened, and the 
loop does not tear oflf the flagella. A confluent spread does not 
give as good satisfaction as a streak spread with a small space be-

Bacillus AnthracisSytnptomaticiyFeserand Bollin8:er(1878) 

SYMPTOMATIC ANTHRAX, BLACK LEG, QUARTER EVIL/ CHARBON 
SYMPTOMATIQUE (FR.) ; RAUSCHBRAND (gERM.) 

Origin. — Found in the subcutaneous tissue, muscles, serous exudate, 
etc., of symptomatic anthrax. 

Form. — Rather large, narrow rods, having rounded ends; almost 
always single, but sometimes are found in pairs. About three times as 
long as wide. Involution forms are seen in old cultures — swollen at the 
ends or in the middle. 

Motility. — Actively motile, having lateral flagella; giant whips are 
often found. Spore-bearing rods lose their motion eventually. 

Sporulaiion. — Spores develop near one end, which is enlarged; they 
are bright and oval in form; are not formed in body until after death. 

Anilin Dyes. — Stain readily. Will stain by Gram's method if a strong 
dye acts for some time. Spores may be readily double stained. 

Growth. — Rapid ; best in acid or alkaline glucose media ; attended with 
strong butyric acid odor. Will not grow except under anaerobic condi- 
tions. 

Plates. — On gelatin, irregular masses are formed surrounded by dense 
whorl of threads. Gelatin is liquefied. On agar, the colonies usually ap- 
pear as dense masses of threads; they vary, however. 

Stab Culture. — In glucose gelatin, growth takes place in the lower 
part of the tube; gas is produced; contents liquefied. In glucose agar, 
growth is energetic and gas is produced, the contents of the tube being 
torn into several parts. Giant whips common (Novy). 

Streak Culture. — On glucose agar in hydrogen, a whitish, spreading 
film is formed. On blood serum, growth is good; giant whips (Loeffler). 

Bouillon. — Is clouded; gas bubbles accumulate on the surface; the 
growth settles to the bottom after several days, forming a compact, ad- 
herent sediment; liquid above remains cloudy for several days. 

Glucose Gelatin, Colored with Litmus. — ^Under ordinary circumstances, 
growth develops in incubator. The litmus is reduced, then colored a 
wine-red, showing formation of acid. Heavy, flocculent sediment is de- 
posited on the bottom. 

Milk. — Coagulates casein rapidly; does not invert starch. Grows on 
potato. 

Oxygen Requirements. — It is an obligative anaerobe. Will grow in 
hydrogen, vacuum, carbonic acid, etc. Grows in glucose litmus gelatin in 
presence of air. 

Temperature. — Grows best at 37-38** C. Will grow slowly at room 
temperature. 

Behavior to Gelatin. — Liquefies. 

Aerogenesis. — Produces gas with disagreeable odor; gas is inflam- 
mable, consisting of marsh-gas, hydrogen, etc. 

Attentuation. — Bouillon cultures lose their virulence soon but retain 
vitality. Attenuation occurs at 42-43**. Dry spore-bearing material be- 
comes attenuated when heated to 80* or 100°. Virulence may be restored 
by inoculating animals, at the same time injecting some lactic acid. Vir- 
ulence is maintained in soh'd media. 

Immunity. — May be obtained by inoculating small amounts of viru- 
lent germ; by intravenous injections; bv injection of heated cultures, 80® 
or 100° ; in active old cultures ; filtered cultures. 

Pathogenesis. — Young cattle, sheep, goats, guinea-pigs and mice are 
highly susceptible. The horse, ass and white rat are less susceptible. 
Hogs, dogs, rabbits, ordinary rats, doves, ducks and chickens are almost 
immune. Death is produced in twenty-four to forty-eight hours in 
guinea-pigs by subcutaneous injection. Extensive subcutaneous bloody 
edema is present. Gas is present. The muscles are dark and infiltrated. 

Infection. — Occurs naturally by inoculation throuprh deep wounds; 
very rarely through food. Poisoned arrows used in fishing in Norway. 

Diagnosis.— -It is especially a disease of cattle, and not of man. It 
is difficult to distinguish the bacillus from malignant edema bacillus. In 
oculation of the rabbit is negative, threads are absent ; tendency to in- 
volutions. It is distinguished from anthrax bacillus by form, motility,, 
by its distribution in the body and by cultural properties.

tween each streak. The finest specimens for photomicrography are 
obtained from the periphery of the streaks. The spreading must 
be done rapidly because evaporation takes place very soon. After 
evaporation takes place, there should appear very thin fihus along 
the track of the loop. The preparation must be fixed in the fiame 
so that the bacteria will not wash off during the staining, bat the 
fixing must not be accompanied by too much heating, because the 
delicate organs of locomotion are easily burned off. The Bunsen 
flame should be about one inch high ; the glass held by the forceps, 
preparation side up, is passed down on to the flame just once and 
instantly removed. The cover-glass is then ready for the mordant, 
which is poured on, just enough to cover the surface without flow- 
ing over the edges. I find that the Cornet forceps are best suited 
for staining purposes, and if the cover-glass be held just a short 
distance within the edge, the mordant or stain will not run off. 
It usually happens that we are unsuccessful in demonstrating fla- 
gella, if the mordant rims off, or goes on the under side of the glass. 
During the steaming of the mordant, it is advisable to keep up a 
rotary motion in order to avoid too much precipitation. When the 
mordant is fresh, it requires only about one-half to one minute to 
get sufficient staining. The mordant is completely washed off un- 
der the tap, and this is done pretty thoroughly; a small quantity of 
absolute alcohol is poured onto the surafce, and this is instantly 
washed off. The alcohol removes a great deal of the precipitation 
which is found in cover-glass preparations, but considerable care 
should be taken to wash it off quickly and thoroughly, because it 
will remove the germs and flagella, if it is allowed to act only for 
a short time. If the alcohol is thoroughly washed off, the water is 
removed by holding the glass edgeways to a piece of fiher paper. 
If the filter paper is not clean, considerable dust and fiber will 
be carried up on to the cover-glass, and if there is any danger of 
this, it is better to finally wash the cover-glass off with the dis- 
tilled water and shake off the drops which cling to the glass. Then 
cover the surface with a carbol fuchsine or carbol gentian violet. 
I find in nearly all cases, that fuchsine is better than violet, and 
gives less precipitation, but in some cases the gentian violet brings 
out the flagella more prominently. This must be fresh, however, 
and thoroughly washed off after staining. We allow the fuchsine 
to stand on the cover-glass for about one-half minute, being heated 
just sufficiently for a thin vapor to be visible. We then heat it so 
that steam is given off quite freely, but never until ebullition takes 
place. Care must be used when heating the stain, because it is not 
unusual to find that there is entirely too much precipitation, and 
the flagella are burned off. It rarely happens that we get a cover- 
glass which will be stained well all over. Usually we get only cer- 
tain sections where the flagella stand out prominently, and the field 



102 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF POOD PRODUCTS. 

is free from precipitation. Views sufficiently attractive for photo- 
micrographing are rare. While the staining may be perfect, there 
will be some defects in the germs. Some may have lost part of 
their flagella, or there may be too much precipitation in the field, 
or the germs may be too close together or too scattered, and the 
ideal views for photomicrography are few, and it is sometimes nec- 
essary to stain up several cover-glasses, before we get a fine view. 
During the staining with the mordant and dye, a thin film is form- 
ed all over the glass. This must not be broken up by the applica- 
tion of too much alcohol, if a clear field is desired. 

Some writers advocate the idea of examining the cover-glass 
preparations on the slide with a drop of water under the cover- 
glass, before finally clearing and mounting the specimen. I have 
been unfortunate in this procedure, and on several occasions have 
lost some beautiful specimens on attempting to float off the cover- 
glass with water, after examination. It frequently happens that the 
germs will stick to the slide and pull off, leaving graves surrounded 
by beautiful bunches of flagella, so I make it a rule to mount my 
cover-glass in xylol-balsam, as soon as I have finished staining. I 
do this as follows: 

I select very thin slides, pieces of glass about 3 inches long and 
I inch wide, perfectly clear, and having no blisters. Having thor- 
oughly cleaned the slide, I heat it over the flame to drive off mois- 
ture, and place in the center a small drop of xylol-balsam (which is 
Canada balsam dissolved in xylol, and comes in collapsible tubes). 
After thoroughly drjnng the water from- the cover-glass after stain- 
ing, I pour pure xylol all over the surface, and immediately touch 
the edge to clean filter paper, and then drive off the xylol with 
heat. It is absolutely necessary to have the cover-glass free from 
moisture before applying xylol. (Xylol is a refined benzine). 
Otherwise, a hazy appearance will be imparted to the preparation, 
and this spoils it for microscopical purposes. After clearing with 
xylol and drying, the drop of balsam is heated gently and the cover- 
glass, preparation side down, is pressed on to the slide so that the 
balsam is spread out in a thin layer between the two pieces of glass, 
and the preparation is. of course, thus protected from injury. The 
method for the demonstration of the flagella of different organisms 
varies, as we have said. The differences which I have noticed have 
been in the length of time allowed for staining with the mordant, 
and the f uchsine ; also the amount of i per cent, sodium hydroxid. 
Great success is achieved only by careful and patient study of each 
org-anism. It is not a difficult matter to demonstrate the flaeella 
of most motile organisms, but to get beautiful preparations is a 
study, and requires great care in every step of the work.

A SIMPLE METHOD OF MAKING PHOTOMICROGRAPHS. 

A large, cumbersome apparatus is unnecessary. The camera 
is about twice as long as the ordinary 4x5 camera, and the photo- 
micrographs are taken with the camera in a horizontal position. 
It must be a steady apparatus and the microscope stand should be 
substantial and with the cone fine adjustment. Much depends upon 
the objective. In order to get negatives showing a flat field with 
clean definition I have used nearly all kinds of olijectives, but have 
found none equal to the 1-12 oil immersion objective and No. 6 
compensating eye-piece made by the Spencer Lens Co. The best 
plates are the isochromatic or orthochromatic swift plates, which 
are correct for colors. I have found the acetylene radiant prefer- 
able to gas, oil or electric light. It is slower than electric light, but 
brings out all details with wonderful nicety. The only screen I 
ever use is green glass. Printing from the negatives on glossy 
Velox brings out the best detail. The glossy Velox is then ferro- 
plated. which makes a beautiful photograph.

Decomposition Caused by Micro-Org^anisms 

Decomposition Caused by Micro-organisms. Fermentation The- 
ories. Vacuum Theory. Alcoholic Fermentation. Acetic 
Fermentation. Butyric Fermentation. Lactic Fermentation. 
Putrefaction. Reprocessing Leaks a Dangerous Proceeding. 



The word fermentation is derived from the Latin word fermeo, 
meaning to boil. The appearance of liquids in agitation due to the 
vital action of micro-organisms no doubt gave rise to the word. 

The word fermentation as commonly used, implies more than 
the processes of decomposition accomplished by bacteria, molds and 
yeasts. Micro-decomposition is perhaps a better term, since it ap- 
plies directly to the breaking down processes accomplished by micro- 
organisms and their enzymes (products formed) only, and does not 
take in the chemical changes induced by chemicals, rennets and 
animal secretions. The term embraces also the different processes 
of putrefaction, which are separated by some authors, but it seems 
to me that they should be considered under one head. 

FERMENTATION was the term that was applied to these 
processes by the early investigators, and the history of their labors 
and deductions is interesting, since it shows us the difficulties with 
which they were beset and permits us to see the rays of light and 
truth as they are let into the darkness by the different stars in the 
scientific world from the time of Leeuwenhoek down to the present. 

The early investigators, a few excepted, fell victims to the 
false theory of Spontaneous Generation. Needham (in 1745) 
founded a demonstration of this theory on his failures to preserve 
meat juices by boiling in flasks, claiming that "infusoria" were 
spontaneously created from the juices themselves. 

In 1765 Abbe Spallanzani took the opposite stand, claiming 
that if air, which had been exposed to fire, were admitted to flasks 
containing meat extracts, the "animalcules" would not develop. In 
1836 Franz Schultz conceived the idea of filling the flasks with 
air filtered through sulphuric acid and potassium hydroxid, which 
gave him encouragement as an opponent of the spontaneous theory. 
The other side claimed that a chemical change in the air was made 
by such experiments which made it imposf^ible for the animalcules 
to hatch from the vital principles of the infusions. They also 



DECOMPOSITION CAUSED BY MICRO-ORGANISMS. 105 

found that the methods referred to were not reliable and that micro- 
organisms would make their appearance in many cases. Thus the 
study of fermentation and its causes began to occupy the attention 
of investigators. In 1862 Pasteur published his researches on fer- 
mentation and Von Liebig still opposed him with the theory of 
spontaneous generation. Then Tyndall came forward with his ab- 
solute proof that micro-organisms did not develop from inorganic 
protoplasm (^elementary compounds), but that they developed, ojily 
as they found admittance through the atmosphere and that. if in- 
fusions were sterilized fermentation could not possibly take place. , 
By this intermittent heat process he sterilized all kinds of liquids j 
and solid food substances and gave the opposition such a blow that 1 
the "spontaneous'' theory fell. 

The theory is only unproved, however, since all must admit of 
a beginning of all life. That the beginning of a species is due to 
a creative power is probably the best way of disposing of the ques- 
tion; at what time we cannot say; whether it is still going on we 
cannot say; but there is evidence that such is the case. 

There are several kinds of decomposition which cannot be as- 
cribed to the action of micro-organisms which the word fermenta- 
tion would include. There is a spontaneous decomposition of sugar 
in vegetable and fruit cells, which when kept in a pure and un- 
contaminated condition, liberate carbonic acid gas CO2, and form 
alcohol in appreciable quantities. This is no doubt due to 
the life of the fruit itself, which Ts living protoplasm, and 
wlien seeds are present, vital principles are therein contained 
which have the power to decompose the sugar in the fruit or vege- 
table cells. It is a curious fact that when a whole tomato is heated 
in a flask to the boiling point, after a lapse of time it will be found 
quite devoid of sugar so far as taste is concerned. Quite a liberal 
quantity of gas will be liberated also, and when the seeds are ex- 
amined carefully the gelatinous envelope will be found perfect as 
before heating and the seeds are capable of germinating when 
planted. The decomposition takes place without the vital activity 
of micro-organisms. The experiment may be made by anyone in- 
terested by placing a perfectly sound ripe tomato in a thin glass 
jar and melting the top down to a narrow neck by means of a blow 
pipe, (the skin of the tomato should be washed oflf with a solu- 
tion of bi-chlord of mercury) . This narrow -neck may be stuffed 
with sterilized cotton and the flask held over the flame just long 
enough to permit steam to flow freely through the cotton. A bent 
tube may be fastened with rubber over the neck of the flask and 
the end submerged in a dish of water. To measure the escaping 
carbon dioxid. a bottle with water is inverted over the end of the 
tube under water. \ As fast as the s^as is evolved the water is ex- 
pelled from the bottle, but the process is slow.

CANNING AND PRESSBRVINQ OP POOD PRODUCTS. 



I have investigated a number of cases of 3.0rx:aJk£L5pringJbQt- 
toms in cans of fruit, especially California fruits. Cases of canned 
Truit are frequently found where the bottoms of the cans spring, 
showing that there is no vacuum in them and quite a quantity of 
gas, sufficient to cause the bottom to spring out when pressed in 
by the hand. 




Fig. 29 



In some cases I have found wild yeasts to be the causCj but 
more frequently the cans are quite free from bacteria or f un^ of all 
kinds. This led me to the conclusion that there was decomposi- 
tion going on from a different cause, and after experimenting I 
found in some cases, after a few months that the cells of the canned 
fruits were actually losing sugar and that considerable carbon di- 
oxid was being set free. After applying heat sufficient to kill the 
cell life of such fruit, the phenomenon is no longer observed ^ .CmH 
ned fruits will therefore undergo spontaneous decomposition if suf- 
ficient heat is not employed in the sterilizing process to destroy the 
life of the cells. The fruit flavor suffers to some extent from the 
extended sterilization, but the trouble and loss is avoided. One 
other fact deserves mention in this connection and that is the tem- 
perature which develops spring bottoms. If the cans are stored 
in a temperature of 40° to 50° F. and opened before being allowed 
to reach a warmer temperature, even the underprocessed fruits will 
be found to be free from partial decomposition. It usually hap- 
pens that the trouble is experienced after the cases are brought out 
for sale in the early summer, just before the fruit season opens. 
Wholesale grocers who buy heavily in the fall and store the goods, 
usually experience some trouble when the cases are brought out in 
warmer weather for the trade. 

There is another cause of decomposition, and that is thejnflu- 
cnce of light on canned goods, particularly foods canned in glass. 
This is true of foods containing tartaric acid, glucose, lactose arid 
maltose, etc., especially if the foods are faintly alkaline or if alkalies 



DECOMPOSITION CAUSED BY MICRO-ORGANISMS. 107 

are present even in small quantities. The action of sunlight on ex- 
posed solutions containing tartaric acid may be expressed by the 
following chemical equation : 

C.HeOe + 3O = 2CH^O^ + 2CO2 + H^O. 

Tartaric acid + Oxygen = Formic acid + Carbon dioxide + 
Water. 

Glucose and lactose have been found on exposure to sunlight 
in hermetically sealed packages to break down and form alcohol and 
carbon dioxid, or just the same fermentation that is caused directly 
by the yeast plants (Saccharomyces). The same two substances 
may yield, in the presence of lime, lactic acid and carbon dioxid, 
or a fermentation corresponding to that produced by the bacteria 
which cause the souring of milk. Thus maltose is broken up, and 
yields dextro-lactic acid; levulose yields levo-lactic acid, and invert 
sugar will yield an inactive acid, when polarized. 

A word of advice to canners of food products in glass might 
l^ opportune in this connection. Wrap your glass goods well, and 
m_eadi. case put cards requesting the retailer not to remove the 
paper when he places his goods on the shelf. All such goods should 
be neatly wrapped and have labels on the outside sufficiently at- 
tractive for the shelf. Goods unwrapped for show windows should 
be sold very soon on account of the danger of chemical changes 
noted above. 

The word fermentation has a wide meaning, in fact it is a 
word to which various definitions have been given not in accord 
with its root meaning, and it is made to embrace all such transfor- 
mations and decompositions as we have just described, so we return 
to the word micro-decomposition as one which defines the changes 
produced by fungi directly. 

Bacteria molds and veasts are nutrient food substances to build 
Up cell protoplasm, and this is followed, or there goes on at the 
same time, an excretion of waste materials which have received the 
names of enzymes and toxins. There are formed at the same time 
various acids and chemical compounds as a result of the disturb- 
ances caused by the utilization, by bacteria, of certain elements such 
as carbon, oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen, which are torn from the 
molecules containing them, thus setting free other atoms which unite 
to form those products of decomposition. To make this clear to 
the reader not familiar with chemistry it may be explained thus : 
A molecule is the smallest body conceivable which retains the iden- 
titv of the substance, and this molecule is formed bv two or more 
atoms or elements. An atom is an element. The atoms are united 
to one another in certain relations which form the different sub- 
stances with which we are familiar ; thus alcohol is expressed by its 
molecular symbol CaH^O. which means that two atoms of carbon, 



/ 



108 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

six atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen are united. Now 
if a fluid containing a limited quantity of this alcohol (less than 
15 per cent.) is planted with the acetic acid bacteria in the presence 
of atmospheric oxygen, the germs will use from the alcohol two 
atoms of hydrogen and from the air two atoms of oxygen, and the 
result is that the alcohol is changed into acetic acid and water thus : 

CoHeO + 02 = C2H4O2 + H2O. 

Alcohol + Oxygen = Acetic acid + Water. 

Substances undergoing micro-decomposition usually contain 
various species of bacteria and the chemical compounds produced 
are often very complex for the reason that each species may be 
transforming the same substance into characteristic compounds, and 
the acids and compounds formed by one species may be attacked 
and changed by a different species into different compounds. For 
instance, the yeast plants may be producing alcohol by their action 
on glucose, and at the same time the acetic acid group will seize on 
the alcohol produced and convert it into acetic acid, and this acid 
. may be attacked by still another species and converted into car- 
' bonic acid and water. In order _to, study with, accuracy Ihejrom- 
' pounds formed by a given species it is evident that pure cultures of 
that species must be obtained and grown in a favorable nutrient 
medium. The separation of pure cultures is comparatively easy by 
the methods established by Dr. Koch of growing them in solid media 
such as gelatin and agar, which confines the different species to 
isolated positions where they may be transplanted to other media 
in unmixed cultures. 

There are usually several products resulting from the vital 
activity of a given species, thus the yeast plants produce alcohol, 
carbonic acid, succinic acid, glycerin and some volatile acids. There 
are many varieties of yeast plants which produce these products in 
varying quantities; some species yield very large amounts of alco- 
hol and are specially cultivated for brewings baking, ^tc. The 
products elaborated by them depend largely upon the material in 
which they are growing, and this is true of all bacteria as well. 
Vital activity goes on as long as fresh material is added until a 
certain per cent, of waste product is produced, when they cease to 
perform their functions ; then they become dormant or actually die 
under the influence of the chemicals formed during vital activity. 
Thus the yeasts will multiply until about 15 per cent, of alcohol 
is produced. In addition to the products mentioned above the 
yeasts or saccharomyces produce an enzyme which is a soluble fer- 
ment capable of producing alcoholic fermentation after the germs 
are dead, if placed in fresh nutrient media. There are a number of 
molds which produce alcohol and various acids when submerged 
in fermentable materials. Oxygen is required in large quantities by 



DECOMPOSITION CAUSED BY MICRO-ORGANISMS. 109 

the molds and when this is cut .off by excluding the atmosphere, 
they seize the oxygen which is in combination and a true fermenta- 
tion, resembling that of yeasts, is produced. The free admission of 
atmospheric oxygen lessens the fermentation, since this requirement 
is more easily appropriated than that which is in chemical combi- 
nation. The fermentation will be accomplished completely in a 
longer time, however, since the evolution ^of gas formed cuts off 
the supply of atmospheric oxygen and the chemical combinations 
are broken down for their supply. The vacuum therefore is aJ 
good condition for alcoholic fermentation. Multiplication is not so( 
profific but fermentation is more violent and considerable heat is 
generated, due to the breaking up of molecules and the formation 
of new chemical compounds. Alcoholic fermentation was formerly 
allowed to go on slowly for months in the breweries, but the process 
has been greatly shortened by the vacuum process. The vacuum 
pumps are set to work and the oxygen and gases are pumped away 
from the fluids, thus compelling the yeast to break up the sugar; 
more rapidly, for their supply of oxygen. 

A great many bacteria which grow naturally and luxuriantly 
in the presence of air, are thus enabled to cause more violent fer- 
mentation when air is excluded or when they are compelled to grow 
in vacuo. Thus jwe see, that a vacuum has no value as a means 
of preventing fermentation. In canning fruits and vegetables in 
tin cans a vacuum is desirable, not for the prevention of fermenta- 
tion but to cause the ends to draw in .after the sterilizing process. 
During this process the ends of tin cans become bulged and unless 
a vacuum is present, after cooling they draw in very slowly or not 
at all. The vacuum is produced by heating the contents before 
finally sealing the cans or by mechanical means, the power depend- 
ing upon the heat and fullness of the cans. The expansion of fluids 
is greatest at or near the boiling points and on cooling there is 
a corresponding contraction. When cans are not filled full and the 
contents are q^uite hot the vacuum formed on cooling has great 
power, .often.causing. the cans to collapse. The vacuum may be 
regulated by attention to the heat and fullness of the can. A tem- 
perature of i8o® F. and filling as full as possible will produce a 
vacuum of sufficient power for all practical purposes. The vacuum 
has value in the detection of swells ; cans which do not draw in are 
likely to be either leaks or swells. In this connection I want to 
call attention to the misrepresentations of certain manufacturers of 
vacuum machines. Recently a circular reached me giving glowing 
accounts of a machine capable of sealing in vacuo thousands of 
cans daily, doing away entirely with the sterilizing process, and 
claiming great saving in steam and labor and the preservation of 
natural flavors. The whole process was described, which consisted 



t/ 



DECOMPOSITION CAUSED BY MICRO-ORGANISMS. 113 

of putting raw fruits, veg:etables, meats, etc., in patent cans, which 
were run into the vacuum machine where the air was completely 
exhausted and the sealing was done in vacuo. I wrote these parties, 
requesting a detailed account of their process, for I supposed that 
there must be some sterilizing process connected with it, but to my 
astonishment they claimed that the vaccum produced was all that 
was necessary. There are a number of canners who look upon a 
vacuum as a necessary condition. The fact is, however, that_ a 
vacuum is one of the best conditions for decomposition when cer- 
tain species of living bacteria and spores are present. 

THE VACUUM THEORY. 

There seems to be such a widespread misconception of the true 
value of a vacuum in canned goods that a careful study of the 
theory may not be out of place at this time. Occasionally new ma- 
chines are advertised for packing all sorts of goods by the "vacuum 
method," the advertisement reading that goods are superior in flavor 
and require less cooking, perhaps none, if this or that method is 
employed. In years gone by, nearly every packer believed that a 
vacuum in liis cans was absolutely necessary for perfect keeping 
of the goods. The method generally adopted for obtaining the 
vacuum was to heat the cans in boiling water with vent holes 
open ; the cans were then taken out and the holes were soldered or 
*'tipped,'' after which the cans were ready for sterilization or the 
final process. Another method was to seal the cans completely; 
then they were given five or ten minutes boiling, after which each 
can was punctured with an awl, thus permitting the steam and 
gases (if any were present) to escape; then the awl holes were 
quickly closed prior to the sterilizing process. This method was 
called venting. The object of these two methods was two-fold, 
viz., to drive off any gases present and to expand the contents by 
heat, so that a vacuum would form by contraction after cooling. 
Another method which is used largely today, is to heat the goods 
before filling, then the cans are sealed while hot, and when they 
are cooled off after sterilization a vacuum is necessarily produced 
by the physical law of contraction. 

It is very convenient and necessary that a vacuum be formed 
in tin cans so that the ends will draw in after the sterilizing pro- 
cess. It would be impossible to drive the ends back in some cases 
(depending, of course, upon the goods) unless this vacuum were 
formed. There is one exception, that is, cold packed tomatoes ; but 
this cannot be called a true exception, because the tomatoes are 
generally warmer during the canning than they are after the cans 
have been passed through the final process and allowed to cool. 
Even then it is necessary at times to force the ends back to their 



114 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

natural position; this is called "snapping." Itjs generaUy thought 
by packers that all cans are sound which give evidence of a vaclium, 
and this idea has given rise to the belief that a vacuum actually 
keeps the goods from spoiling. It is indeed surprising how gen- 
erally this error has crept into the minds of packers and certain 
manufacturers of vacuum machinery, too. Only two years ago a 
certain manufacturer declared to me that he was able to reduce the 
time of sterilization by twenty to twenty-five per cent. He claimed 
to have the records to prove that his assertions were correct. An- 
other manufacturer distributed broadcast a circular describing his 
new vacuum machinery, by means of which he claimed to be able 
to can fresh fruits and vegetables without heating (as far as I was 
able to learn), and these he claimed would keep indefinitely with- 
out fermenting or decomposing. This machine was manufactured 
in Chicago, and its maker claimed that two canning houses were 
running 40,000 cans daily by this method. I wrote to him and 
warned him of the results which must surely follow, and told him 
if I did not comprehend his system fully, I would be pleased to be 
corrected. His reply contained the same claims, but I have never 
heard of the two canneries who were putting out 40,000 cans daily 
with his machine. 

There are some machines on the market which have 3Qme. merit 
as vacuum machines, because they exhaust the air from the cans 
while the contents are cold. This system is particularly attractive 
for some goods, such as rrieats ; it accomplishes the same purpose as 
the old venting method, and the cold cans are more easily handled. 
By the old method it was necessary to heat the cans through to the 
center, which required a prolonged venting process. Every canner 
of meats remembers the tfime when the whole place was smeared 
with the grease which squirted out from the awl holes necessary 
in venting. The modern vacuum machine entirely does away with 
all that extra labor, inconvenience and unsightliness. This vacuum 
machine is made with a circular chamber, into which a dozen or 
more cans are carried around a sprocket wheel. When the ma- 
chine is filled the chamber is closed and the air is exhausted by 
a vacuum pump. Each can has been previously capped, but the 
vent hole is left open, and the air is exhausted from the cans through 
the vent holes. Near the vent hole is placed a small button of solder 
with the necessary flux, and as the cans revolve they pass under 
a window and are tipped in vacuo by means of a tipping iron heated 
by electricity. The iron is not automatic but is controlled by the 
operator from the outside. A small electric light inside the chamber 
furnishes the illumination. As each can is brought under the 
window the small piece of solder is melted over the vent hole. 



DECOMPOSITION CAUSED BY MICRO-ORGANISMS. 116 

When the cans are all tipped, the vacuum is released, and the cans 
are carried out of the machine and carefully inspected for leaks. 

As we have stated, the value of this device is the saving of 
time and the neatness of the work. It does not decrease the time 
required for sterilization, but does save the expense of venting. 

The vacuum has no advantage as a means of shortening the 
sterilization of any canried goods. To understand this thoroughly 
let us study the character of the bacteria which are responsible for 
the spoilage of canned goods. There are a great number of bac- 
teria yeasts and molds which will cause chemical changes in can- 
ned goods unless they are destroyed by sterilization. 

Nearly all the bacteria which cause the spoilage of canned 
goods after incomplete sterilization are spore-bearing, organfsms. 
If there should happen to be a leak in the can, or should processmg 
be neglected, non-sporating varieties would set up decomposition. 
Non-sporulating varieties are always destroyed at boiling tempera- 
ture (212^ F.) All spore-bearing bacteria which are responsible 
for spoilage in canned goods are either anaerobic or facultative 
anaerobic ; that is to say ; some are able to grow only when oxygen 
is entirely absent, and some are able to adapt themselves to either 
condition. The vacuum, then, is an ideal condition for the growth 
of^anaerobic bacteria, because the stronger the vacuum, the better 
the environment- The least trace of oxygen interferes greatly with 
tne^uitiph'cation of these germs. When we speak of oxygen in 
this connection, we mean free oxygen as it is found in the atmos- 
phere. The anaerobic bacteria do require oxygen, but not in the 
free state; their supply is always obtained from molecules of nutrient 
substances which have oxygen chem.ically combined with other 
atoms. In chemistry we speak of any substance as being made up 
of molecules, and the molecules as being made up of atoms chem- 
ically combined. A molecule is defined as a very small particle of 
matter which has all the characteristics of the natural substance; 
for instance, a molecule of sugar is the smallest particle which has 
all the characteristics of sugar. A molecule cannot be farther di- 
vided without destroying its character. Thus we may illustrate 
CfiHiaO^ is a molecule of grape sugar which is fermented by the 
lactic acid bacteria will be divided thus : 

Grape Sugar] (Lactic Acid 

which would read thus: One molecule of grape sugar is divid- 
ed into two molecules of Lactic Acid. A molecule is composed of 
natural elements called atoms, and each atom is designated by a 
letter, thus CoHjoOo means that a molecule of grape sugar is com- 
posed of 6 atoms of Carbon, 12 atoms of Hydrogen and 6 atoms 
of Oxygen, and when this combination is broken up other sub- 



116 



CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 



Stances are formed. As we have shown, the molecule of grape 
sugar is changed by lactic fermentation into two molecules of 
Lactic Acid. Now if we let grape sugar ferment under the in- 
fluence of yeast or mold the following takes place : 

CeH.^Oo ] 1 2 QHoO I ^ 1 2 CO2 

1 mol. grape sugar J |2 mols. alcohol J [2 mols. of carbon dioxid 

Then again if we let grape sugar ferment under the influence 
of the Acetic Acid bacteria we have the following: 

CeH,20« 1^(3 C,H,02 

I mol. grape sugar] (3 mols. of acetic acid 

These chemical equations illustrate the fact that a molecule is 
entirely changed in character when it is divided. This gives a 
splendid idea of chemical changes brought about by different organ- 
isms, although in reality they are still more complicated, so that 
instead of Alcohol, Lactic or Acetic Acid being formed alone, there 
are usually several other complex substances formed at the same 
time, such as glycerin, succinic acid and volatile fatty acids.

tion. Nothing is entirely lost chemically and although carbon, 
hydrogen and oxygen are used to build np cell jirotoplasm, those 
elements unite promptly to form the products elaborated by the 
germs, and of course are characteristic of them. 

The Anaerobic bacteria, therefore, obtain their supply of oxy7 
gen from chemical combinations. This is true also of other bacteria 
which are forced to grow in an anaerobic condition. The process 
of decomposition is therefore more complete where the air is en- 
tirely excluded from such micro-organisms, and the vacuum in 
the cans is a favorable environment. The molds, yeasts or bacteria. 
which consume large quantities of oxygen, must obtain that element. 
consequently a much larger quantity of material must be changed 
quickly for the supply of oxygen. In such cases the number of 
germs present is quite small in comparison to the amount of ma- 



Plate 29. Aspergillus Glai 



teriai which is undergoing chemical change. Oxygen is more 
difficult for bacteria to obtain when they are forced to grow in 
a vacuum, because large quantities of material must be deprived of 
oxygen. Decomposition is generally pretty well advanced when 
spoilage is noticed in canned goods, because the vacuum of the can 
has deprived the bacteria of free oxygen. Sterilization must there- 
fore be complete, if goods are to be kept pure and nnfermented in 
tin cans or glass. The vacuum has absolutely nothing to do with 
the keeping quality of the goods, and we might add that the vacuum 



118 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

is a favorable condition for decomposition, unless sterilization is 
complete. 

' ' Test tul)es containing beef juice, corn juice, peas, etc., are 
easily sterilized with only a cotton plug in the top; there is no va- 
cuum, but the germs from the air are filtered out by the cotton. 
This is the method used in the laboratory for sterilizing culture 
media. 

Anv canner niav test the value of a vacuum for himself as 
follows: Take a can of any perfectly sterilized goods, heat an awl 
in a flame until it is red, heat a small surface of the can, holding 
flame directly onto it; then punch a hole in the can without re- 
mo\'ing flame, then seal the hole. The vacuum will suck air into 
the can through the awl-hole but the air must pass through the 
flame which destroys all molds and bacteria. Although the va- 
cuum has been destroyed by the admission of heated air, the con- 
tents of the can will remain in an unfermented condition. 

CONCLUSIONS. 

jMolds, yeasts, anaerobic bacteria and bacteria which are facul- 
tatively anaerobic, will grow in a vacuum, on a nutrient medium. 
There is no such condition as an absolute vacuum in nature, but 
there may be a condition where there is a partial vacuum, where 
atmospheric oxygen is entirely absent or replaced by some other 

' gas. A vacuum will not prevent decomposition. Decomposition by 
bacteria is more complete when air is entirely excluded from can- 
ned goods. Sterilization cannot be accomplished in any less time 
in the presence of a vacuum, since it re(iuires a certain amount of 

• heat, which must be applied for a given time, to destroy spores of 

I bacteria, veasts and molds. 

VALUE OF VACUUM MACIIINKRV. 

Vacuum machinery may have some advantage over other meth- 
ods of obtaining an exhaustion of air, viz., goods may be handled 
cold and considerable labor of venting is saved. For reducing the 
bulk of any goods such as milk where a high temperature is liable 
to injure the flavor, a vacuum is valuable for removing the atmos- 
pheric pressure, so that ebullition may take place at a comparativ^ely 
low temperature. Evaporation by this method has no valite as a 
sterilizing process where spore-bearing bacteria are present; it re- 
quires the high temperature to destroy spores and the vacuum sys- 
tem cannot give successful results in any less time than is actually 
required where that condition is absent. Goods like milk, which 
are condensed by boiling in vacuo, are not sterilized, but are pre- 
served by sugar which nuist be added up to 50 per cent, in some 



DECOMPOSITION CAUSED BY MICRO-ORGANISMS. 119 

cases. Sugar is a preservative when used in large quantities, be- i 
cause it takes up the fluids. Bacteria require fluids for niultiplica- i 
tion, so when sugar is used in excess the spores are deprived of I 
fluid, and therefore remain dormant, but are not destroyed, I 

Before closing, let me remark that no vacuum pump is able to 
remove all bacteria from any goods. It may remove a large num- 
ber from the small air space at the top of a package, but it can- 
not exclude those forms which are in the goods themselves. 



Plate 30. Sacchiromyces Ellipsoideu 



The yeasts and molds are not the only species which produce ■ 
alcoholic fermentation; there are a number of bacteria which con- 
vert glycerin media into alcohol; the typhoid and pneumonia bacilli, 
also a number of bacteria found in the mouth and on the teeth have 
the same power. Some of the mncors are employed in pure cul- 
tures in the manufacture of alcohol. 

The yeasts cannot convert starch into alcohol, so in some places 
molds are employed to convert the starch into sugar and the yeast 
is then introduced to convert the sugar into alcohol. In the manu- 
facture of malt beverages and vinegar the diastase is first employed 
to convert the starch into sugar and this in turn is converted into 
alcohol by yeast. Maltose and cane sugar are changed by a fer- 
ment produced by yeasts, into glucose, which in turn is converted 
into alcohol and the by-products. The chemical formulas are as 
follows :

Invert sugar j \ Alcohol + Carbonic acid 

The use of glucose in jellies, jams, catsup and other food 
products is therefore fraught with danger. The atmosphere Fs laden 
with wild yeasts which easily attack the glucose and fermentation 
quickly follows. It has been customary among jelly and preserve 
makers to adulterate the juices with glucose tp give body and to 
sweeten with saccharin, using some antispetic to retard fermenta- 
tion. It is better to produce pure goods, although it may be ad- 
visable in some cases to use a preservative, but the label should 
plainly state the fact. Large quantities of glucose are mixed with 
syrups and molasses to produce mild syrups, the object being to 
produce a syrup of milder and more delicate flavor and not to 
adulterate. These syrups are hard to keep and should be sealed 
hermetically and sterilized and not preserved with antiseptics. The 
manufacturers of syrups have a great deal of trouble along this 
line. 

ALCOHOLIC FERMENTATION is probably the most use- 
ful chemical change accomplished by the lower vegetable orders. 
By this process all alcoholic beverages and commercial alcohol are 
manufactured. This fermentation is accomplished without the un- 
pleasant odors and flavors so characteristic of many species of bac- 
teria. The baking industry employs the yeasts and bacteria of 
alcoholic fermentation to produce the carbonic acid gas for raising 
or inflating what would otherwise be a heavy mass of dough. 

In the preparation of sauces, catsups, syrups, jams, preserves, 
jellies and food products of like nature the first fermentation is 
generally alcoholic, due more commonly to the mold fungi but often 
to wild yeasts so abundant in the atmosphere. The seed forms of 
molds (called conida) give rise to this fermentation. 

The conida are small round spores which abound on the tufts 
of many varieties of mold and when they are submerged will bud 
and multiply similar in many respects to the true yeasts or saccharo- 
myces. Mold naturally grows on the surface of media which have a 
slight acid reaction, and its oxygen requirement is very great. So 
long as free oxygen of the atmosphere is to be obtained it grows 
luxuriantly without causing any fermentation of the lower parts 
of the material on which it is found, but if the oxygen is cut off 
either by submerging or enclosing, it is forced to obtain its oxygen 
requirement from the molecules in which oxygen is combined, and 
new compounds are thus formed and a fermentation is set up which 
in many respects resembles that of the yeasts.

Various pulps are often filled into barrels hot, with a small 
amount of antiseptic to prevent fermentation, but on cooling quite 
a large air space is left above the surface of the pulp which is a 
rich field for the growth of mold. After the formation of mold the 
pulp will ferment if the barrel is rolled over and permitted to stand 
for a short time in any temperature above 34° F. This accounts for 
the large losses of manufacturers, who load and ship cars of bar- 
reled pulp from one place to another during the spring of the 
year. The pulp when stored away in cellars remains quiet for 
months and appears good, but too frequently the mold is present, 
and loss follows the moving. This may be overcome to some ex- 
tent by boiling pulp down to 20 per cent, solids and refilling bar- 
rels after cooling. Pulp stored in barrels will not keep unless 
a small amount of preservative is added. The loss from alcoholic 
fermentation may be minimized by canning the pulp in large tin 
cans and processing. This insures a far better quality and does 
away with the necessity of using antiseptics. 



ACETIC ACin FERMENTATION, 

Acetic acid fermentation is one of the most important chem- 
ical changes produced by bacteria. Vinegar is tlie chief commer- 
ical product obtained, and while as yet pure cultures of bacteria 



124 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

are not extensively employed to produce it, there is a possibility 
that present methods may be superseded and a vinegar of greater 
strength obtained by the utilization of a single species known to 
have the power to produce a higher per cent, of acetic acid than 
when grown in company with other organisms. 

There are a number of bacteria which produce acetic acid 
when grown in liquids containing not more than 15 per cent, alcohol. 
Pasteur demonstrated that acetic fermentation was due to the living 
organisms w^hich formed slimy scum on the surface of alcoholic 
fluids such as beer, cider, wine, etc. This scum was named "My- 
coderma aceti,'* which means *'germ skin of acetic acid" or "mother 
of vinegar." It is a zooglea mass of various bacteria, such as Bac- 
terium aceti, B. Pasteurianus. Bacillus aceticus, Bacterium Kutz- 
ingianum, etc. 

Acetic fermentation is common and develops rapidly in the 
alcoholic fluids when exposed to the atmosphere at a temperature 
of 80° to 85° F., which is most favorable. Under favorable con- 
ditions with pure cultures 14 per cent, acetic acid may be formed, 
which is equal to 140 grain vinegar. The temperature given above 
must be lowered after the acetic germs have performed their func- 
tions to prevent oxidation of the acetic acid and water by the bac- 
teria still living in the mycoderma. The chemical equations for 
these two changes are s\Tnbolized as follow- s : 

I r^CsH^O + a> r.= CoH.Oo + H,0 

Alcohol -f- oxygen = Acetic acid -\- water. 

2 ==-• C2H4O2 -f 202 + 2 CO2 -f 2 H2O 

Acetic acid -f- Oxygen = Carbonic acid -|- water. 

In the "mother of vinegar" the germs are united very closely 
by mucinous envelopes, which are capsule-like formations, in which 
the bacteria are imbedded. lodin stains these envelopes in a peculiar 
manner. Those of B. Pasteurianus and B. Kutsingianum are stain- 
ed blue, while the germs themselves are not. The envelope of B. 
Aceti does not take the stain. 

At the temperatures given, 80° to 85° F., involution forms oc- 
cur. 

By involution forms we mean that the bacteria change from 
their natural forms, as shown in Fig. 30 and form threads which 
are very much smaller in places and have no resemblance to the 
normal shapes. 

As mentioned before, vinegar is the chief commerical product 
of these germs, and vinegar is formed from liquors containing not 
more than 15 per cent, alcohol. Oxygen is absolutely necessary for 
these organisms and they consume large quantities, and for this 
reason the vinegar spirit is diluted with vinegar and allowed to run 
slowly over beechwood shavings in a vinegar generator, thus ex- 



DECOMPOSITION CAUSED BY MICRO-ORGANISMS. 125 

posing the large surface to the atmosphere. These beechwood shav- 
ings are sown with acetic acid bacteria and a rapid acidification 
follows. By this exposure large quantities of alcohol are lost and 
there are many forms of bacteria which find their way into the 
spirit along with the acetic acid germs. Parasites such as Anguil- 
lula aceti, the so-called vinegar eels, and Pythinm anguilhilae aceti, 
make their appearance and consume both alcohol and acetic acid. 
There are many people who have the opinion that these parasites 
produce acetic acid, but such is not the ca^e. The first named species 
is the more common, but the second belongs to the fungi group of 







Kig. 30. Bacteria found in the Mycoderma Aceti 

Oomycetes and these destroy the first species, as was discovered by 
Sadebeck. The utilization of pure cultures of acetic acid bacteria 
has not been accomplished outside the laboratory, but there is no 
doubt that it is possible and practical. A vinegar of 14 per cent, 
acetic acid strength may be manufactured with pure cultures from 
the very spirit which is yielding only nine, ten and eleven per cent, 
for the manufacturers under present conditions. 

The additional yield of acetic acid means a great saving and is 
worth the attention of manufacturers. Pure cultures may be ob- 
tained easily by the plate culture methods, which were described in 
Chapter III. The spirit can be sterilized and sown with the pure 
culture and pure oxygen can be generated and forced into specially 
prepared tanks in such a manner as to exclude all foreign bacteria 
and parasites. Vinegar thus prepared will he of great strength 
and promises large returns for the successful apparatus. 



126 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

The old method known as the Orleans method of manufactur- 
ing vinegar is still used in many places. The method is thus de- 
scribed by Lafar, page 397. "A number of oaken casks, each of a 
capacity of some 55 gallons, are arranged in rows in a chamber 
maintained at a constant temperature of 64° to 71° F. In the upper 
part of the head of each cask a circular aperture is provided, through 
which the cask is tilled and emptied and which is generally kept 
closed whilst near it is a very small vent always left open for the 
admission of air. In normal work each cask is about half full. Be- 
fore setting a new cask in work, it is scalded out several times with 
steam or hot water, in order to extract the sap from the wood, and 
is then 'soured' by impregnating it with good, boiling-hot vinegar. 
About 22 gallons of good, clear vinegar on less than Yi gallon of 
wine are then placed in the cask, another V^ gallon of wine being 
added at the end of eight days, more after the lapse of another 
week and so on until the cask contains 40 to 44 gallons." Vinegar 
is then drawn from the cask after the "mycoderma" has formed 
and this is replaced by the addition of wine. The cask is used for 
several years when deposits are so heavy as to necessitate emptying 
and cleaning." 



z Acid Bacreria 



The slowness of this method is apparent and the opportunity, 
for contamination by injurious bacteria is great. There are enor- 
mous losses of alcohol and acetic acid and the quality of the vin- 
egar is often very poor. This process was improved ( ?) by Pasteur 
in 1862, who cultivated the "mycoderma" or "vinegar flowers" in 
small vessels and transferred this to the surface of the wine in vats 
kept open and exposed to the air for the supply of oxygen, but 



DECOMPOSITION CAUSED BY MICRO-ORGANISMS. 127 

the process produces various results due to contaminations by harm- 
ful bacteria. Pasteur's idea of cultivating the true acetic acid bac- 
teria was good, but the apparatus is faulty. For this reason his 
methods are not now in favor, the quick vinegar method having 
taken its place to a very large extent. 

These two processes have been outlined in this connection mere- 
ly to point out the imperfections in them and not to describe the 
best method of manufacturing vinegar. By the present methods 
it is plain that the mixed germs employed in acetic fermentation 
do not accomplish the best resits and that there is considerable loss 
in alcohol and acetic acid. 

In general, acetic fermentation causes very little trouble as a 
source of spoilage in the food products industry. Wines used 
in table sauces and soups may suflfer from it if left exposed tO" 
the atmosphere and the same is true of any product in which alco- 
hol is present not to exceed 15 per cent. Pulps which have under- 
gone alcoholic fermentation either on account of wild yeasts or 
molds will also undergo acetic fermentation along with other fer- 
mentations such as lactic and butyric. Manufacturers of tomata 
catsup who use barrel pulp can call to mind numerous instances 
where the pulp had turned into vinegar and other complex acids. 
The preservers have some difficulties, too; preserves, apple 
butter, peach butter and light syrup goods are subject to slight al- 
coholic fermentation, unless properly handled and sterilized, then 
acetic fermentation follows with the loss of sugar. 

Dill pickles, pearl onions are salted with just enough salt to 
plasmolyze the harmful organisms, and alcohol is generated first, 
then follows acetic and lactic fermentations to produce vinegar 
having a characteristic flavor. 

All vinegar having a certain per cent, of solids in liable to 
deterioration through the agency of harmful bacteria, hence storage 
in cool places is recommended for such as malt and cider vinegars. 

BUTYRIC FERMENTATION. 

There is a recipe for butyric fermentation given in some chem- 
istries, as follows : Put into a 10 per cent, sugar solution a small 
quantity of chalk and cheese and keep this at a temperature of yy^ 
to 86° F. The first fermentation that starts is lactic in which lactic 
acid and calcium lactate are produced : the next is the butyric fer- 
mentation which is set up by an anaerobic organism 2/x broad and 
from 2 — IS/A long, which was discovered by Pasteur in 1861. 
Pasteur did not class this germ as belonging to the bacteria but 
considered it an animalcule, because it had a rapid movement. Its 
manner of vegetating, however, is now settled and it can positively^ 



128 CANNING AND PRESERVING OP FOOD PRODUCTS. 

be said that it belongs to the fission fungi, because it multiplies by 
lengthening and dividing and forms spores. It is endowed with 
numerous flagella, growing out all over the surface of the cell and 
by means of these its rapid motion is attained. 

There are a number of bacteria capable of producing butyric 
acid, some of which are anaerobic, while other are aerobic. 

Prazmowski studied the cause of this fermentation and de- 
scribes an organism which corresponds with the "vibrion butyrique" 
discovered by Pasteur and named it Clostridium butyricum. An- 
other germ similar in many respects was named Butyricus amylo- 
bacter, which is so named because the cell contents resemble starch 
which turns blue with iodin staining. So closely are the two germs 
allied, however, that I believe them to belong to the same family. 
In 1884 Hueppe discovered a bacillus which grows in the presence 
of oxygen which he named Bacillus butyricus and another similar 
to this was later discovered in old cheese and named Clostridium 
foetidum, while from milk Bacillus liodermos has been obtained. 

In butyric fermentation various compounds are produced such 
as butyl alcohol, butyric, acetic and carbonic acids, hydrogen and 
sulphuretted hydrogen, etc. The fats and carbohydrates are sub- 
ject to this fermentation and a chemical equation may be thus 
symbolized to show the decomposition of glucose into butyric acid, 
carbonic acid and hydrogen. 

Glucose. I ( Butyric acid + Carbonic acid + Hydrogen. 

There are two kinds of butyric acid, diflrerentiated in organic 
chemistry as fermentation butyric and isomeric acid or isopropyl 
formic acid, which is not obtained by fermentation; both have the 
same chemical symbols but are differently arranged in atomical re- 
lation. Butyric acid fermentation can be observed and studied by 
our readers by boiling a small quantity of milk in a test tube and 
allowing lactic fermentation to take place, which precipitates calcium 
lactate, which is attacked by the butyric acid bacteria, and from this 
cultures may be obtained by the plate method. 

Butyric bacteria, whether they belong to the aerobic or the 
anaerobic species form spores which are resistant to high temper- 
atures. They are found on the leaves and fibre of nearly all kinds 
of vegetables and cereals ready to set up butyric decomposition 
whenever the conditions are favorable for their development. The 
cellulose or fibre is the part usually decomposed by these organisms. 
It is a remarkable fact that even paper, made from wood pulp, will 
dissolve in a fluid undergoing butyric fermentation. It must not 
be supposed that simple butyric acid is the only product elaborated 
by species of this group since there have been isolated certain or- 
ganisms which produce sweet-smelling ethers and aromatic sub-

Stances which are valuable in the ripening of certain kinds of cheese, 
Among these might be mentioned Butyricus Amylobacter which we 
considered in the early part of this chapter, and Clostridum foeti- 
dumelactis, which gives the flavor to Limburg cheese, also a sugar- 
loving species found in soft country cheese called bacillus saccharo- 
butyricus. Milk generally contains the spores of the butyric acid 
group, and it is due to them that the disagreeable odors which are 
associated with its decomposition are set free. 

We make mention of cheese and milk and the bacteria asso- 
ciated with them because they enter largely into the formulas of 
special food products such as soups, macaroni and cheese (salad 
dressings), etc., sold on the market under private names. There 
are several different kinds of gases evolved where butyric fermen- 
tation is going on, H2S (sulphuretted hydrogen), C Oo (carbonic 
acid gas), CH^ (methane or marsh gas). There are, how- ever, 
some species which do not produce any gas. I isolated one species 
from cream of tomato soup, which had coverted the milk sugar 
and invert sugar directly into butyric acid without swelling the 
can. This species corresponded to the one isolated from soft cheese 
by V. Von Klecki, which he named bacillus saccharobutyricus men- 
tioned above. The soup had been given a process of 250° F. for 
twenty-five minutes; the spoilage did not develop until a lapse of 
three weeks. It was found by experiment that one hour at 250° F. 
was necessary to destroy the spores of this organism. In some of 
the cans the regular well-known species w^ere found, but the cans 
were swelled. 

Butyric decomposition, while inimical to the canner's products, 
nevertheless has its uses in nature, and in some industries. It plays 
an important part in the preparation of brown hay, sweet ensilage 
and sour fodder, and in the aging of manures. In the retting of 
flax and hemp, the cellular substances are dissolved so that the fibre 
can be obtained in the pure state. 

Butyric decomposition is one of special interest to canners of 
peas, string beans, asparagus, celery, corn and similar vegetables, 
because the spores of different types of butyric bacilli are present 
on surface of the pods and fibres. The butyric spores are usually 
ellipsoidal in form and not quite so broad as the mother germ; 
they_withstand dessication remarkably well and high temperatures 
are required to destroy them. There are some other kinds of spore 
bearing germs which are more resistant than these, but not many ; 
250° F. for a few minutes w'ill destroy the spores, but in order 
to get this temperature at the center of the cans the nature of the 
contents must be studied. If the material is heavy and thick and 
contains much fibre, it wnll require a much longer time than when 
the contents of the cans are strictly fluid. The exhausted cans are 



132 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

not absolutely without oxygen since the space within contains some 
air, consequently strickly aerobic forms may be able to set up de- 
composition. Usually, however, the decomposition is set up by an- 
aerobes and facultative anaerobes. Since almost all butyric bac- 
teria belong to these two classes the conditions in canned vege- 
tables are specially favorable for their vital activity. 

The canning of such vegetables as are liable to butyric de- 
composition should be done very soon after they are harvested. The 
growing plants are not favorable for the invasion of these bacteria 
and it is only after they are harvested and attacked by other germs 
such as the lactic acid group that the hardier forms begin their 
work of destruction. They are specially active on vegetables which 
are par-boiled and allowed to stand exposed and thus demonstrate 
that they are true scavengers. 

The development of spores and the formation of spores is ac- 
complished in from thirty to forty-five minutes by the butyric bac- 
teria when e\'ery condition is favorable. \\'hen partly cooked vege- 
tables are allowed to stand too long the center of the mass will 
be attacked by the anaerobic forms while the aerobic forms on the 
surface are thriving. Those on the surface use up the oxygen 
from the air, at the same time set free various gases and in this way 
create the most favorable conditions for the development of the 
anaerobic variety, the spores of which are scattered within the 
mass. This is also true of the raw material which is piled too close- 
ly. Here the peptonizing ferments begin to vegetate and soften the 
fibre, causing the juices to ooze through their protecting sacs and 
the temperature is increased so that the appearance of the vegetables 
resembles par-boiling; in other words, they look as if they were 
cooked. This is the condition as before described and butyric de- 
composition progresses rapidly. A bitter flavor is often imparted 
to such vegetables by a bacillus, which has given me considerable 
trouble to isolate. It is a spore-bearing bacillus actively motile, 
due to a large number of flagella. The spores are very hardy, re- 
quiring about fifteen minutes at 250"^ F. to destroy them. They 
are oval and located in the center of the rods which at times give 
the bacillus a Clostridium appearance. The development of the 
spore is similar to that of the Bacillus megatherium of De Bary. 
The young rod passes out of the spore at right angles to the long 
axis of the spore and often retains the spore shell at one or both 
sides. The bacillus is from 2fi to 6/x long and about o.Sfi to ifi 
broad, with rounded ends similar to B. subtilis. It forms butyric 
acid and coagulates milk, is a facultative anaerobe and does riot 
cause the cans to swell. Cans of peas, asparagus and string beans 
inoculated with a pure culture turn quite bitter within six days. 
The colonies growing on agar are round with a pale, transparent. 



DECOMPOSITION CAUSED BY MICRO-ORGANISMS. 133 

very delicate zone surrounding them; the surface is white, sHghtly 
wrinkled, becoming more so with age. When magnified by 250 
they are yellowish and opaque. The deep colonies have a whet- 
stone appearance. Grows well at a temperature of 85^' to 90° F. 

As bitter decomposition has caused the canners considerable 
trouble at times the description here given will be interesting. The 
bacillus may produce the bitterness in the raw material if too long 
exposed or to the partially cooked products if allowed to stand too 
long before the final process, or it may develop in the cans if under- 
processed. The spores are destroyed, however, at a temperature of 
250^ F. for fifteen to twenty minutes' actual heat ; time required 
for penetration of can and the contents must be added to this. 

Frequently I have noticed that goods which have undergone 
chemical changes due to bacteria have no living bacteria in the cans. 
When the fluid is examined under the microscope there are numer- 
ous bacteria present, but when agar or gelatin plates are inoculated 
there would be no growth. These bacteria when mounted fail to 
take the stains readily, which proves that they are dead. This 
phenomenon will be noticed frequently by our students in their 
researches and is explained in two ways; either the bacteria w^ere 
destroyed during the sterilizing process, having previously accom- 
plished the chemical changes, or they died under the influence of 
the products elaborated by themselves, either before the sterilizing 
process or more likely afterwards. If vital activity goes on after 
the sterilizing process, the amount of acid produced is often germ- 
icidal, and this may be accomplished in a few days; it is usually 
after a longer time, however, varying from three weeks to six 
months. The examination of spoiled cans should be made as soon 
as possible after the trouble develops. 

A great deal of the trouble experienced from butyric decom- 
position is avoided by careful attention to cleanliness. Remember 
that the floors and machinery will be covered more or less with 
accumulations each day and this dirt contains the elements of what 
you are packing. Fai4ure to remove such accumulations by the lib- 
eral use of soap and water, and at times a powerful disinfectant, 
only invites an inimical host of bacteria, w-hich is ready to attack 
the fresh product which is being canned. The waste material 
should be moved far away from the factory, and where practical it 
may be put into silos and converted into money where a market 
is offered for ensilage. The habit many packers have of loading 
wheelbarrows and dumping cobs, husks, pea-pods, peelings and 
waste just outside of the factory in great piles, is very dangerous. 
\Vhile you may have been successful in one season with a certain 
time and temperature in your sterilizing process, you may have 
great diflficulty during the next season. The atmosphere in the

Bacillus Meg^atheriuniy Dc Bary 

Origin. — Found originally on boiled cabbage leaves; is present in the 
air and in the soil ; it is also found on other vegetable matter. 

Form. — Large cylindrical rods, having rounded ends, three to six 
times as long as broad, and with granular contents. They are found in 
pairs, ordinarily slightly bent; they may form threads. Involution forms 
are quite common, and capsulated cells are especially found in slimy 
growths. 

Motility. — They have six to eight flagella, and have a slow, creeping 
motion. 

Sporulation. — Median spores are formed. 

Anilin Dyes. — Stain readily, though irregularities may be seen which 
are due to granular protoplasm. 

Grozvth. — Rapid. 

Gelatin Plates. — Small, irregular, yellowish colonies are formed, which 
later show marked branching or radiating forms — these soon liquefy the 
gelatin. Sometimes the colonies are kidney-shaped. 

Stab Cultures. — The growth is rapid, attended with liquefaction along 
the line of inoculation, and may show threads of bacteria penetrating out- 
ward into the solid gelatin. The gelatin becomes wholly liqueBed later, 
a flocculent mass accumulating on the bottom ; the liquid clears up without 
any formation of scum on top. 

Streak Cultures. — On agar, a dull white or grayish covering is 
formed. On potato, a thick, slimy, grayish-white mass is rapidly formed, 
rich in spores and involution forms. 

Oxygen Requirements. — Aerobic. 

Temperature. — May grow in incubator, but optimum heat is at about 
20° C. 

BchaiHor to Gelatin. — Liquefies rather slowly. 

Pathogenesis. — No effect has been observed.

neighborhood of your factory may be laden with the spores of new 
varieties of hardy bacteria which have grown hixuriantly on the 
piles of waste in the yard. These find entrance to your cans and 
complications arise, goods undergo transformations, and you are 
tempted to blame Providence for your losses. The canners who 
are alive to the benefits of clean floors, machinerv and tidv emploves 
and who remove every obnoxious element out of the factory and 
yard are really the men who experience small losses from spoilage, 
and their careful methods create a care for the quality of the goods 
they pack and an interest in the selection of raw material. The re- 
sult is that their goods bring the best prices, their establishments 
are open to the public and the whole moral effect of cleanly meth- 
ods is apparent. 

LACTIC FERMICNTATION. 

Lactic fermentation is accomplished by a large number of 
bacteria and is one of the most useful chemical changes. It is prob- 
ably the earliest known form of decomposition, since milk gives a 
good example, and milk has been used as food from the time of 
creation and its use was no doubt familiar to the first inhabitants 
of the earth. In the early days of the inicroscope forms of life 
were noticed, chiefly those belonging to the wild yeast and mold 
fungi ; but not until the time of Pasteur was there any definite un- 
derstanding as to the true cause of lactic fermentation, for all 
theories previously advanced attributed the changes wrought in milk 
to spontaneous generation. Lister was probably the first investi- 
gator who obtained pure cultures of Bacterium lactis, a germ seldom 
found outside of dairies. Hueppe followed with a more careful 
investigation by means of gelatin plates and isolated several spe- 
cies of bacteria which were capable of setting up lactic decom- 
position. The principal organism discovered by him was Bacillus 
acidi lactici, which measures i to 1.7/A in length and 0.3 to 0.4/x in 
breadth, non-motile rods, usually in pairs. Bodies resembling spores 
are present, but they are not true spores, although so considered 
by some authorities. Casein is precipitated and carbonic acid gas 
is liberated at ordinary temperatures. Bacterium Prodigiosum, de- 
scribed under head of Chromogenic Bacteria, Chapter 11, produces 
lactic acid. 

Micrococcus acidi lactic (Krueger,) found as single or diplo- 
cocci, is aerobic, forms lactic acid, and liquefies gelatin. 

Bacterium lactic acidi. Bacillus lactis acidi. Bacterium acidi 
lactis. Bacterium limbatum lactis acidi. Micrococcus lactis acidi and 
Sphaerococcus lactis acidi, were isolated from sour milk by Marp- 
man. 



138 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 



Bacillus Acidi Lacticiy Hueppe 

Origin. — Found in sour milk, also in fermenting vegetable matter. 

Form. — Thick, short rods, two to three times as long as wide, usu- 
ally found in pairs; but rarely found in chains or threads. 

Motility. — It has no real motion, but has a marked Brownian move- 
ment. 

Sporulation. — Round, terminal bodies have been observed, but are 
not spores. 

Anilin Dyes. — Stain readily; so does Gram's method. 

Groti'th. — Rapid and abundant. 

Gelatin Plates. — The deep colonies are oval or round, yellow, finely 
granular, with sharp borders. The surface colonies spread and form 
thin plaques, having irregular wavy borders. The outer zone of the colony 
is almost transparent at first, showing markings which resemble the veins 
in leaves. 

Stab Culture. — The growth on the surface is considerable, spreading 
rapidly; it is a thin, dry, white covering; growth along the puncture is 
slight. In old cultures bundles of crystals are formed along the line of 
inoculation, more especially at or near the surface. 

Streak Culture. — On agar, a grayish- white, moist, spreading growth is 
formed. On potato, a brownish-yellow, slimy growth is formed. 

Milk. — In sterilized milk, the lactose is converted, in part, into lactic 
and carbonic acids. Casein or curd is caused by the acid reaction thus 
produced. The change will occur only in the presence of air. Old cul- 
tures do not affect milk. 

Oxygen Requirements. — It is a facultative anaerobe. 

Temperature. — It will grow between lo* and 45° C, but grows best 
at about 30** C. 

Behavior to Gelatin. — Does not liquefy. 

Aerogenesis. — It forms gas in milk; also forms carbon dioxide and 
alcohol. 

Pathogenesis. — ^It has no effect. Growth is stopped by 0.75% lactic 
acid. It produces lactic acid in the mouth (dental caries) ; also abnormal 
fermentations in the stomach and intestines. Lactic acid bacteria promote 
the growth of anaerobic bacteria.

Bacillus lactis (Bleisch), found in buttermilk ami frequently 
in onlinary cream, is a large bacillns, lormiiig spores of great re- 
sisting power. It is a facultative anaerobic actively motile organ- 
ism, and converts glucose into lactic acid without the evolution of 
gas. "The bacillus is about t/i broad and 3 to 5/1 in length and 
may be cuhivated in agar plates, or on a substratum of cream of 
tomato soup. The specimen shown in Plates 40 and 41 was found 
in a can of sour tomato soup in which no gas had formed, the 
sugar having been broken up directly into lactic acid. On Agar 
and potatoes it forms a light gray coating. 



Lactic Acid Bacilli 



Tlie chemical equation for fermentation by this organism may 
be symbolized as follows; 

CiaH^aOii + H,0 = 4 C^HnOa 

Grape sugar -j- water = Lactic acid (4 molecules). 

CoHj^Oe = 2 CgHnO^ 

Glucose = Lactic acid (2 molecules). 

The reactions are seldom so beautifully simple, however, for 
there are liberated by various germs, gases of different kinds which 
complicate the chemical equations, and the quantity of lactic acid 
is of course less than the expression given here. Lactic fermenta- 
tion, even where pure cultures are employed, is, accompanied by 
acids of a volatile nature. 

.-\ number of Pathogenic bacteria have the power of producing 
lactic ackt"Tvhen grown in milk; among these might be mentioned 
the Cholera bacillus. Bacillus of typhoid fever, Bacterium coH com- 
munis. Bacterium lactis aerogenes and Friedlander's bacillus of

LACTIC FERMESTATIOX is utilized commercially.. in

cultures of the very best bacteria are obtained from the laboratories 
and the cream is prepared and sohti with these. Formerly the

ous action of the germs present in the cream, consequently a.pogr 
quality of butter was frequently turned out, due to injurious bac-

A short description of modern butter-making in this connection 
falls under this head, especially the consideration of bacteria there- 
with associated. Butter is used extensively in various specialties 
which are canned and served in buffet cars, so the peculiar flavor 
of fine butter should be known to guide the canner in his selection.

crograph of the culture, which is named "Startolinc." The culture 
shows the presence of Saccharomyces Pastorianus, and a coccus — 
described by W. Storch — which measures about i/i in diameter. 
There is also a fission fungus, discovered by H. W. Conn in 1895, 
which is styled Bacillus N'o. 41. .This is a non-motile rod about 
i.ifi long, generally single, sometimes united in pairs, which grows 
best at 75' F. Cream is not coagulated and very little aci<l is 
formed by it, 

The combined influence of these organisms is a pure lactic 
fermentation set up by the cocci and the fine flavor produced by 
the Conn Bacillus No. 41. There seems to be a difference between 
the flavor and the acidification, which mav be described as follows: 



142 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

The pure acidification gives a fine sweet taste to_the butter, while 
the flavor or aroma has the characteristic of what is known as 
"grass flavor" or "June flavor,*' so marked in countr^'ibutter made 
when the grass is green and tender. The Conn bacillus was iso- 
lated by him from a sample of milk he obtained from South 
America, and it is employed by a hirge number of dairies through- 
out the world. 

Lactic acid bacteria play an important part in the preparation 
of the yeast mash in distilHng, vinegar-making, and brewing. The 
preparation of the green malt for malt vinegar is interesting. The 
malt has many kinds of bacteria associated, some belonging to 
the butyric acid group. These are hardy types and these form 
spores of great vitality. The malt is mixed with wrater and heated 
to about 155° F., which kills all vegetating bacteria, but leaves

the spores of the undesirable germs uninjured, which, if allowed to 
produce butyric acid, would prevent the yeast from accomplishing 
its part. In order to prevent these from vegetating, artificial sour- 
ing is induced by lactic acid bacteria, which acidity is antiseptic to 
the butyric bacteria. The lactic acid fermentation is accomplished 
either by the aid of pure cultures planted in the mash or by main- 
taining the temperature at 120° F., which is about 20° higher 
than the optimum temperature for the development of butyric bac- 
teria. At 120^ F., the lactic acid bacteria flourish well, and lactic 
acid amounting to about i to 1V2 per cent, is formed, which is 
ascertained by standardizing with normal alkali solutions, such as 
sodium hvdroxid. The mash is then heated to about \^^^ F..

which kills the lactic acid germs, also any other vegetated forms, 
and after cooling sown with pure cultures of yeast, which set up 
alcoholic fermentation without injury from the butyric and acetic 
acid groups. 

The advantage of using pure cultures of lactic acid bacteria 
is great, for the reason that the spontaneous souring is apt to mis- 
carry at times and forms of heat-loving bacteria often find their 
way into the mash along with the lactic acid bacteria from the 
ak. 

The pure culture now used is one discovered by Dr. Franz 
Lafar. of Vienna, from a yeast mash in the Lietzen Distillery. 



Plaie 43. Bacillus Acldificans Longiss 



He named the germ Bacillus aciditicans longissimus from the fact 
that it is very much longer than the ordinary lactic acid bac- 
terium. This organism measures i/* in breadth by from 2 to 20/» 
in length, and has the power of producing more lactic acid than 
any other germ so far discovered. A i^irc culture was obtained 
from the Berlin Experimental Distillery Station (Versuchsstation 
fur Brennerei). Germany, but was dead when it reached us. 

By means of pure cultures of this organism, lactic acid may 
be produced at small cost compared to the price paid for the chem- 
ical preparation. Lactic acicl is rec|uired for special industries. 
such as dyeing and color printing on fabrics. 

Lactic fermentation takes place in the preparation of pickled 
meats, sauerkraut, pickles, white pearl onions, beets, cauliflower. 



144 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

olives and various products which are put away for curing in brine. 
Only a Hmited amount of salt is used at first because salt has anti- 
septic power, causing plasmolysis of the germ cells. The lactic 
acid group does not suffer in the presence of limited quantities, and 
soon produces lactic acid in sufficient amounts to prevent the de- 
velopment of the germs peculiar to the various food products which 
are pickled. 

The brine first added, ought to register about 75 on the Beaume 
salt scale, and as fast as the salt is absorbed more salt must be 
added until the fermentation is completed. At no time should 
the scale show less than 50 degrees. The brine will be found 
heavier at the bottom than at the top, so agitation is necessary 
or a pump may be used to lift the bottom brine up to the surface. 
If this be done once or twice a day good results w^ll be obtained. 

This method, while used extensivelv. is faulty from the fact 
that the lactic fermentation is set up spontaneously by germs from 
the atmosphere. The result is that harmful races of bacteria 
sometimes gain an entrance in company with the lactic acid germs, 
and unpleasant flavors are produced. Soft pickles, slimy rauli- 
flower and discolored meats, are due to the admission of bacteria 
whicli break up cellulose and others belonging to the chromogenic 
group described in Chapter II. The bacteria which gain entrance 
with the lactic acid bacteria belong chiefly to the Subtilis group, 
and these thrive well even in the presence of considerable quantities 
of salt, and in the presence of lactic acid in limited amounts. 

There is room for great improvement in the pickling of such 
products as mentioned : by first heating the raw material to a point 
where all vegetating forms will be killed — about 160° F. — and 
chilling, then by adding the proper amount of salt and sowing 
a pure culture of lactic acid bacteria, uniform results can surely 
be obtained. 



PREPARATION OP SAUERKRAUT. 

As we have stated, lactic fermentation plays an important part 
in the preparation of sauerkraut, the lactic fermentation being in 
fact the desired chemical change. Let us therefore look carefully 
into the process and gather a few^ facts that may lead to improve- 
ment of the quality and minimize the losses. After the cabbage is 
cored and cut it is put into large wooden tanks with salt sprinkled 
over each layer and packed firmly. Finally there is a top weighted 
dowMi, and according to present methods fermentation is permitted 
to take place spontaneously. There are various spore-bearing bac- 
teria and lactic acid germs throughout the whole tank. A gradual 
increase of temperature takes place and the various spores begin 



DECOMPOSITION CAUSED BY MICRO-ORGANISMS. 146 

to vegetate in proportion to the amount of air that is circulating. 
The temperature rises gradually until it reaches between iio° and 
120^ F. 

At 100° F. the spore-bearing bacteria will gain the mastery 
and as more weight is put on the top the air is excluded and the 
temperature reaches about 120° F., which is the optimum point 
for the lactic germs, and the activity of the other class is im- 
peded. At this temperature the lactic fermentation goes on until 
sufficient acid is formed to prevent decomposition by the other 
class. Now the improvement that suggests itself is this : Instead 
of depending upon the lactic acid germs in the atmosphere to find 
entrance to the cabbage, let a pure culture be sown throughout 
the tank and the temperature raised at once to 120° F. Lactic 
fermentation by the pure culture would begin at once, and the in- 
imical germs would not be able to grow, wdiich would give uni- 
form results — a beautiful white sauerkraut with a delicate aromatic 
flavor. The temperature at the center may be tested by pushing 
a self -registering thermometer down from the top. After having 
once reached the proper temperature, pressure from the top can 
be regulated to keep it uniform. 

There is no branch of the food product industry which suffers 
such severe losses as that devoted to brining and pickling, and there 
is great need of improvement over present methods to enable the 
manufacturers to depend on their processes. The installation of 
the laboratory where pure cultures of useful bacteria may be ob- 
tained is a great boon. There are many causes of spoilage in the 
salting houses; frequently the water is bad, due to minerals and 
injurious bacteria ; different crops of raw material will vary in the 
number and character of bacteria infesting them, and inability to 
get proper fermentation at all times, makes the problem of se- 
curing uniform results difficult. No fixed rule can be laid down 
where dependence is placed upon spontaneous fermentation, and 
the quality secured depends largely upon the kill of the one who 
is doing the work. XVith pure cultures, however, there is very 
little chance to have poor quality if the material is good. There 
IS a n\ai*ked improvement in the quality of goods turned out in 
many, industries due. to the utilization of pure cultures of useful 
bacteria, and the manufacturers of food products will also gradual- 
ly become interested. 

Xow let us condense the directions governing the lactic fer- 
mentation in brining: 

FIRST, make liquids containing pure culture of lactic acid 
bacteria by stirring the culture into a quantity of distilled water. 

SUCOND, sprinkle the liquid over each layer of shredded 
c<nbbage. also the required amount of salt.

THIRD, increase the temperature to 120° F. and maintain 
at that point until the lactic fermentation starts, then control the 
temperature by pressure from the top. 

ENSILAGB. — We have referred to the utilization of waste 
material, such as cobs, husks, peelings, strings and ends of beans, 
pea pods, etc. The quality of an ensilage made from these depends 
upon the care of the silo. The scientific principles are nearly the 
same as those outlined for brining except that the salt is not used. 
When the silo is filled, pressure is brought to bear to bring the 
temperature up to 120° F., which is the proper point favorable 
to the thermogenic bacteria, among which various races of lactic 
bacteria predominate. There are oth^r varieties, however, which 
are heat-loving and some butyric and valeric acids are elaborated. 
By this method the loss of digestible albuminoids is great and 
compounds are formed which have no value in feed material for 
cattle. Ammonia and amide compounds are formed by the decom- 
position of albuminoids. 

The undesirable features of this method can be entirelv over- 
come by controlling the bacteria which are useful in the production 
of good ensilage. A pure culture of lactic acid bacteria, if_ so wed 
in the silo at the proper time and at the temperature f avora_ble_ to 
their growth, will insure a valuable and marketable product for 
feeding farm stock. 

The lactic bacteria are utilized in the tannins: industrv in 
the fermentation of the plumping soak and the bark liquor, which, 
of course, has no connection with the canning industry and simply 
mentioned here as a fact, interesting from a bacteriological stand- 
point. 

j Lactic bacteria, then, are useful in the preparation of various 
■food products and the transformations accomplished by them afe 
seldom inimical, as the great majority of them are easily destroyed 
at ordinary temperatures, but there is one, possibly two, varieties 
which are associated wn'th milk and form spores of great resisting 
power. 

PUTRIiFACTlOX. 

Putrefaction is a term usually dififerentiated from fermenta- 
tion by some authors because the material which undergoes putre- 
factive decomposition is albuminous, while the carbohydrates are 
changed by fermentation. Micro-decomposition, however, takes 
in putrefaction, as such transformations, whether accomplished in 
albuminous substances or in carbohydrates, are the result of the 
vital activity of bacteria; in fact, the same germs are frequently 
able to decompose either substance when planted under favorable 
conditions. 



DECOMPOSITION CAUSED BY MICRO-ORGANISMS. 147 

PUTREFACTION is accomplished in substances which con- 
tain carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulphur, etc., while fer- 
.nientation has been restricted to substances containing only carbon, 
oxygen and hydrogen. The breaking up of albuminous substances 
is generally accompanied with disagreeable odors, which are no- 
ticed in such elaborations as indol and skatol where nitrogen and 
sulphur are combined. Sulphuretted hydrogen and the foul odor 
of dejecta are due to the cleavage of protein matter. Ammonia 
and the amines are the products of alkaline nature set free from 
decomposing proteins, while acids often pleasant in taste and flavor 
are formed by fermentation of carbohydrates. There are, however 
a number of bacteria which are peculiar to putrefaction and are 
seldom if ever found in carbohydrates. 

The tearing down processes are therefore complete, fermen- 
tation splitting the carbohydrates and putrefaction splitting the pro- 
teins into simple elements. In this manner all dead matter, wdiether 
belonging to the vegetable or animal kingdoms, is reduced to simple 
elementary compounds and is not permitted to accumulate. Bac- 
teria frequently cause death to both plant and animal life, but death 
may result from climatic changes or old age, or through renew- 
ing processes. The leaves of the trees are touched by frost and 
fall; the blossoms perish and the animal sheds his skin and hair 
and all nature is constantly putting off the old and renewing as 
fast as necessarv. Death therefore is natural and not alwavs caused 
by bacteria. One is apt to fall into the error that bacteria are 
primarily the cause of all dead matter, since they are known to 
be responsible for so many diseases, but close study of life will 
teach us that this is not true. How wonderful then is the plan 
of nature for the removal of the vast amount of organic matter 
that is thrown down all the time! XVere it not for the bacteria 
the earth, would soon be unfit for habitation and nature would be 
unable to furnish the elements necessarv for removinsf worn-out 
matter. 

The carbon (in decomposing matter) (combined in tlie mole- 
cules) is set free as carbonic acid gas, the hydrogen and oxygen 
combine and form water, the nitrogen and sulphur in the protein 
molecule form nitrates and sulphites and these elements are then 
in a simple state and can be utilized by vegetable kingdom directly 
and by the animal kingdom indirectly in building up new tissue; 
the vegetable kingdom using the carbonic acid gas in the atmosphere 
and the nitrates in the earth, and the animal kingdom using the 
starch, fats, sugar, etc.. obtained from the vegetable kingdom. 
Thus we see that the vegetable kingdom is the source of nearly all 
food supply, to the herbivorous animals directly and to the carnivor- 
ous animals indirectiv, while man is furnished bv a vegetable diet 
directly and a flesh diet indirectly by the vegetable kingdom.

Vibrio Choleras Asiaticae, Koch (1884) 

CHOLERA SPIRILLUM, COMMA BACILLUS/ BACILLE VIRBULE (FR.). 

Origin. — Found in the excreta of cholera patients, also in the in- 
testines after death. Found several times in the water supply and milk. 

Form. — Short, rather thick rod, having rounded narrowed ends, and 
varying from a straight rod to one bent in the form of a half circle; it 
usually resembles a comma, from which it derives its name of comma' ba- 
cillus. If two cells remain attached the letter *'S" is formed. When 
grown in liquid media under unfavorable conditions it may form long 
spirals. The bent rod is a segment of a spirillum and is called a vibrio. 
In old cultures peculiar involution forms develop. 

Motility. — Actively motile, usually having at one end a single Ragel- 
lum, sometimes two. Hanging-drop cultures should be developed at 37^ 
— motion, spirals and involutions occur. 

Sporulation. — So called Arthrospores. No resistant forms are known. 
Not true spores. 

Anilin Dyes. — It is stained slowly. Carbolic fuchsin stains very well. 
Does not stain by Gram's method. 

Growth. — At ordinary temperature it is fairly rapid. 

Plates. — On gelatin plates kept at 22"", white or pale-yellow colouies, 
coarsely granular, with irregular rough border which is surroundel by a 
faint rosy hue, are formed. These colonies at first appear as small, white 
points; these gradually reach out to the surface, producing rather slow 
liquefaction, so that funnel-shaped depressions are formed. The colonies 
develop in fifteen to twenty hours. Entire liquefaction of gelatin occurs 
after several days. On agar plates at ^7"^, the large colonies present a 
peculiar, bright, grayish-brown appearance which is quite distinct from 
that of the common bacteria found in water and in feces. 

Stab Culture. — In gelatin growth occurs along the entire line of in- 
oculation. A funnel-shaped liquefaction with an air space above forms at 
the surface, the growth subsiding to the lower part. The lower part of 
the puncture is gradually widened by liquefaction; the growth settles to 
the bottom, and the entire contents of the tube are eventually liquefied. 

Streak Culture. — On agar, a glistening, whitish grow^th is formed. 
It liquefies blood-serum slowly. On potato, kept in the incubator, a thin, 
grayish or yellowish-brown, somewhat transparent layer is formed. This 
resembles that of the glanders bacillus to some extent. Unless a mixed 
culture is used no growth is obtained at ordinary temperature. 

Bouillon. — Rapid growth, especially in incubator, and a scum or pelli- 
cle is formed on the surface. Cultures twelve to twenty-four hours old 
display a reddish-violet color on the addition of sulphuric acid—the indol 
reaction — due to the formation of indol and nitrous acid. 

Milk. — In sterile milk the growth is abtmdant, without much change; 
also in sterile water. 

Oxygen Requirements. — Artificial cultures require oxygen. 

Temperature. — Grows best at 37° C. Will grow at i5°-42° C. Killed 
at 50° C. 

Behavior to Gelatin. — Liquefies slowly; old cultures, especially. 

Immunity. — Subcutaneous or intra-peritoneal injections of the dead 
or living vibrio yield a serum which is anti-infectious; injections of the 
soluble toxin yield an antitoxic serum. The cell contents of the cholera 
vibrios render immune. PfeifFer's reaction with the serum of convalescents 
or that of immunized animals or man (Chap. XIV). 

Pathogenesis. — Rabbits are killed very quickly by intravenous injec- 
tions. In guinea-pigs intra-duodenal injections or introduction of cul- 
tures into the stomach, previously alkalized, produce death with choleraic 
effects. The intraperitoneal injection of agar culture is fatal in the ex- 
treme to guinea-pigs; is attended with rapid fall of temperature. Sub- 
cutaneous injections of pigeons is not fatal. Typical cholera is pro- 
duced in man by ingestion of cultures. The feeding of cultures to new- 
born rabbits and guinea pigs is usually attended with fatal results. 

Infection. — Takes place along the alimentary canal, through water, 
food, contact witl: freshly soiled matter, etc. The bacillus grows in the 
intestines, and characteristic symptoms of intoxication are induced by the 
soluble poisons elaborated by it. 



DECOMPOSITION CAUSED BY MICRO-ORGANISMS. 149 

Putrid substances contain carbon and nitrogen in composi- 
tion and the plants are unable to use them thus combined, so the 
putrefactive bacteria set in to decompose these combinations and 
the carbon is soon set free as carbonic acid gas, and the nitrates 
and nitrites find their way into the soil as ammonia, and this is 
utilized by plant life. 

Tiie putrefactive bacteria are called saprogenic, and by the 
old writers the bcctcrium termo, which is not a name signifying 
an individual species, but a class to which many allied species be- 
long. The saprogenic bacteria may have the power to set up true 
fermentation when planted in substances containing sugar, starch, 
etc., but their true character is asserted in their ability to decom- 
pose albuminoid substances. 



The decomposition of albumen is generally attended with bad- 
smelling gases. Some of these gases are so foul that the bacteria 
wJiich produce them are hard to liandle, The odor elaborated by 
one, called Proteus Vulgaris, is abominable. 

The compounds which have such malodorous characteristics 
belong to the aromatic class. Several of them have been isolated 
by L. Brieger, M. Von Xencki, and E. Bauman, 

Indol C,H-X is produced by quite a number of bacteria, and 
its presence forms a basis of differentiation of closely allied species. 



160 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

It combines with nitrous acid as an imide to produce nitrose indol, 
which is red in color. This characteristic is brought out by adding 
Sulphuric Acid H2SO4 in the test. The Cholera Spirillum was 
the first pathogenic organism discovered w'hich produced indol. 

Skatol was isolated by Brieger in 1877 ^^ human excreta, its 
presence being attributed to bacteria in the intestines; it is a very 
foul substance. 

Sometimes, Phenol is a product of vital activity resulting 
from the decomposition of albuminoid substances ; also Orthocresol 
and Paraocresol. 

Methyl indol acetic acid is a very foul substance associated 
with degredation of albuminoids. It was isolated by N. Von 
Nencki from a culture of Bacillus liquefaciens magnus, growing 
in the anaerobic state. 

Putrefaction is a common (phenomenon) in (imperfectly steri- 
lized) canned goods of certain kinds, principally cans containing 
meats, meat extracts, vegetables containing albumen, and milk. 
This may be due to leaky cans or insufficient sterilization. The 
odors from swelled cans of corn, peas, beans and alL kinds of meat 
are familiar to very canner of those products. 

The greatest possible care in the packing of these ^opds is 
essential. In the process of putrefaction there are various pto- 
^ maines and toxic poisons formed, which sometimes cause consider- 
able trouble. Whenever a case of poisoning occurs which the 
physician attributes to canned goods, the packer suffers to some 
extent, but the whole industrv suffers more. Packers sometimes 
get very poor advice from incompetent writers and the follow-ing is 
a sample. 

REPROCKSSED I^KAKS. 

The following quotations are made from an article which ap- 
peared in one of the canners' journals in a series of articles pul^- 
lished for the benefit of packers : 

**The first paragraph is headed 'Defective Cans,' and reads: 
'While piling out, some defective cans may be detected; these 
should have immediate attention. Open tip holes, repair cans, then 
retip and reprocess regular time. In some instances these may 
again be placed in the same grade of goods. When leaks are found 
after goods have stood several days, open tip hole, repair can, ex- 
haust, tip and process regular time. Goods thus treated may be 
classed in a lower grade.' '* 

Such advice, scattered broadcast, is extremely dangerous. 
There is probably nothing outside of deliberately putting poTson 
into food that would cause such dangerous stomach and intestinal 
complications as this practice. 



DECOMPOSITION CAUSED BY MICRO-ORGANISMS. 151 

In order that the packers may more fully understand the 
danger of putting out reprocessed leaks, let us look into the subject 
from various points of view. 

1. There is danger of ptomaines forming in putrescible food. 

2. There is danger of pathogenic molds and yeasts gaining 
entrance to acid foods. 

3. There is danger of tin and lead poison. 

4. The quality is extremely poor, therefore detrimental to 
the packers' reputation. 

The first reason for not selling such goods is the danger of 
ptomaines having formed in putrescible material. 

There are a number of bacteria freely distributed in the air, 
water and decomposing matter, which are capable of setting up 
putrefactive processes. These bacteria will not, as a rule, grow 
readily on raw material, but thrive luxuriantly on a great variety 
of cooked foods. Owing to their wide distribution in nature, physi- 
cians and some scientists have not taken true account of them and 
their power to produce ptomaines. A ptomaine is a complex chem- 
ical compound formed in several ways, principally as a product 
elaborated by certain bacteria belonging to the putrefactive class, 
and also to the pathogenic bacteria (which are the cause of diseases 
in man and animals and are parasitic on living protoplasm). 

Xot all ptomaines are poisons; only a few of them are so 
classed, but these few are either formed or excreted by a large 
num.ber.of bacteria. The poisons elaborated by the pathogenic bac- 
teria are toxins which may be united with various other substances, 
and these are termed ptomaines; the real poison, however, is a 
toxin. Such bacteria as typhoid, tetanus, glanders, cholera, etc., 
all produce toxins, and these toxins unite with other compounds 
which may be extracted with ether and thrown down as ptomaines. 
The ptomaines commonly found in decomposing vegetables, meats, 
fish, cheese, milk, etc., are gen cf ally due to the more common and 
widely distributed organisms shown in the plates. There are also 
other varieties generally regarded as quite harmless which form 
ptomaines in very many different kinds of food, especially when 
forced to grow in an anaerobic condition, that is, where air is ex- 
cluded. In the ordinary tin can this condition is very nearly com- 
plete, especially after fermentation has set in and carbonic acid gas 
or phosphuretted hydrogen has driven out the oxygen through a 
small leak. In such a condition the ptomaine bacteria are forced 
to obtain that very necessary element — oxygen — from molecules 
with which it is combined. Thebreaking down processes are there- 
fore quite rapid and the chemical changes take place within very 
limited time, so that canned goods could thus be changed within 
forty-eight hours, or perhaps less. 



152 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

Ptomaine poisoning is much more common than generally 
known. The evil effects are often experienced afteLnieats, when 
cramps are followed by diarrhoea and severe headache. Sometimes 
these cases are quite severe, and the unfortunate suffer terrible 
pains with tremors, followed by coma, and even death. The cases 
on record are not a few, where whole companies of individuals 
have been stricken after banquets, suppers, picnics, parties, etc. 
Some of these cases have been thoroughly investigated, and the 
ptomaine responsible has been obtained from cultures of the bacteria 
found in the food. Usually in such cases tlie food does not, by 
any peculiar taste or odor, indicate the presence of an injurious 
substance. As we have previously stated, the chemical changes are 
rapid and the potmaines may be formed where unperceived decom- 
position is taking place. It usually happens that food containing 
ptomaines has been exposed, or worked over, and the task of defin- 
ing the cause of such poisoning is often quite difficult. 

I could mention a number of cases from all parts of this coun- 
try and Europe, where families have been stricken and the poison- 
ing was charged directly against canned goods by the attending 
physicians. In my writings on ptomaines, I have scored such de- 
cisions by physicians mercilessly, because I firmly believe that many 
of them jump at conclusions without proper investigation. Xow 
permit me to say, if the packers should follow such advice as ap- 
pears in the quotation in the beginning of tliis paper, no one with 
any respect for his integrity would dare to make defense against 
the charge that ptomaine poisoning is due to canned goods. Any 
physician who should happen to read that packers worked into 
salable packages goods undergoing decomposition would, without 
the least hesitation, cast the blame of such poisoning directly on 
canned goods, if any had been eaten by the unfortunate persons. 
In our laboratory work we have isolated from spoiled good^ of 
many different kinds, various bacteria classed as common, some 
of them harmless to man when taken into the stomach, yet these 
very bacteria will produce ptomaines and toxins, especially when 
growing with other varieties. Rven Bacillus Prodigiosus, the com- 
mon bacterium which produces a red color on potatoes, bread, etc., 
a bacterium found commonly in the air, soil, water, decomposing 
material, and on the leaves, po(U. vine^ and stalks of vegetation, 
will produce metabolic compounds when growing with other or- 
ganisms, and these compounds have known toxic properties, fatal 
in some cases to animals, by subcutaneous and intraperitoneal in- 
jections. Bacillus subtilis and bacillus allii. the former a very 
widely distributed organism, the latter a bacterium foimd on de- 
composing onions, give rise to poisonous compounds in some cases. 
We have recently isolated a bacillus from a leakv can of mince

meat, which produces cholin, gadinin and trimethylamin, well 
known ptomaines. This mince meat was canned and a pie made 
with it made one person very sick, causing cramps, cold extremities 
and tremors. 

I. Proteus Vulgaris, Mirabilis and Zenkeri and the colon bac- 
illus are found throughout the alimentary tract in man and many 
animals, also on cooked foods undergoing decomposition. They are, 
therefore, quite common, but when permitted to grow in food will 
produce powerful ptomaines. 

How isitj^Jheiij that we are not more frequently poisoned, if 
these are SD^CQUimon? Of the varieties mentioned one or more are" 
taken into the stomach with various foods at every meal. We aim 
to eat only. fresh. foodj which passes into the stomach where it is 
acted upon by the digestive enzymes, gastric juice, saliva and bile. 
These substances retard' the development of these bacteria and de- 
stroy them in some cases. The food passes on to the intestines, 
where the acids are neutralized and the food is rendered alkaline. 
Here, then, is a favorable environment of temperature and alkalin- 
ity, so great numbers of bacteria grow rapidly, only to be cast out 
usually before any poisons are absorbed. 

We can therefore readily see the difference between a partial-' 
ly decomposed food (containing these bacteria and their poisons) 
taken into the stomach, and perfectly fresh food, or food that has 
been kept free from the action of bacteria. 

From this it is quite reasonable to suppose that some of the 
bacteria which form ptomaines will gain access to leaky cans and 
will form these poisons rapidly. I want to say here that after the 
ptomaines are formed they are not always driven out by cooking, 
in fact some of the most deadly ptomaines are active after cooking. 
The bacteria may all be destroyed, but their poison remains. 

• 2. There is danger of pathogenic molds and yeasts gaining 
entrance to acid foods. 

There are several molds that have been classed as pathogenic ; 
prominently, Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus fumigatus. Molds 
grow well on acid fruits and vegetables and the products formed, 
while not considered deadly, might cause stomach and intestinal 
troubles. Several yeasts have been found which, when putrid, yield 
metabolic compounds of a basic nature, belonging to the amine 
group of ptomaines. (See Vaughn & Xovy's "Cellular Toxins.") 

3. There is danger of tin and lead poisoning. 

It is a well known fact that tin and lead compounds are 
poisonous. Ordinarily, in canned goods, these are present in such 
small quantities that they are considered harmless. Several years 
ago the Bureau of Chemistry, Department of Agriculture, at Wash- 
ington, gave this subject consi«leral)le attetition. Some of the tin

plate examined at that time gave unfavorable results, but in gen- 
eral tbere were found only small quantities of the oxids of tin and 
lead. 

\\ hen decomposition sets in, however, there are formed acids' 
which attack tin plate and the lead in the solder most vigorously, 
and the gases throw them down in the form of insoluble oxids, 
which are poisonous. Canned goods which become swelled be- 
cause of leaks have formed considerable acid and gas by the ac- 
tion of bacteria and when worked over must contain tin and lead 
in appreciable amounts. 

4. The qualily is extremely poor, therefore detrimental to 
the packer's reputation. 



Plale 47. Aspergllfus 



From all that we have written it must follow that goods sent 
out with such conipotmds formed in them will be very poor in 
qualily; a second process would greatly injure the flavor in perfect- 
ly pure goods, but when poisonous compounds are also present one 
cannot imagine anything more detrimental both to the packer and 
the consumer. The evil results do not end here; the whole canning 
industry is assailed and maligned by the new.spapers and hostile 
writers, and the innocent are made to suffer with the guilty. 

K\-en,' can of goods yon send out will probably reach a con- 
sumer who is looking for something good to cat; ez'cry package 
iviU cither make a friend or an ciuvuy far your brand, and when 



158 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

you are packing your goods think of this a!l the time. If you htive 
any cans which have suffered hy accident in breakdowns of ma- 
chinery or foreign matter having gained entrance, throw ihem 
away rather than run any risk of sending out goods of inferior 
quahty. 



What disposition can be made of leaks, you ask? Cut them 
open, empty them and send the contents to the diiiiip or wash 
them away in tlie sewer. However wa-^tefnl this may seem — do it 
— you will save rpore in reputation than you can ever gain by sell- 
ing inferior and dangerous goods. 

There should not be many leaks if there is a proper system of 
inspection. I find that out of a pack of over ten million cans one 
year I lost by leaks less than one-fifth of one per cent., or two out 
of one thousand. It is a good plan to have two inspectors, and 
women are, as a rule, quicker to see a leak than men. One of the 
inspectors is placed at a point as near the automatic capper as 
possible. As the cans pass this point all cap leaks, pin hole leaks, 
etc., are taken off the conveyor and patched. The other inspector 



DECOMPOSITION CAUSED BY MlCRO-OEaANISMS. 169 

is placed at a point beyonil the tippers and all tip leaks, buttons and 
cans with suspicious patching are sent back to the tippers. 

The cans are conveyed into a tub of water where women 
gather and pile them top up, into process crates ; and these women 
are trained to look for leaks as they handle the cans. A small 
premium for leaks found at this point is a good incentive for watch- 
fulness and the cost can be made to fall on tiie inspector? and the 
tippers, according to plans carefully made. One man to patch, 
two tippers, two inspectors and four women to pile cans in crates 
will be sufficient help to properly care for 50,000 cans daily, and 
the leaks found in cans, imperfect tin and caps will not exceed, as, 
I have said, more than two out of one thousand. 

I stated previously that leaks should be cut open and the con- 
tents emptied. This should be done rather than to haul the swelled 



cans to the dump. Strange as it may sccni. in the large centers 
we find poor people who will take swelled canned jj'^ods home and 
eat them. In order to avoid any serious results it is better to dump 
tlie contents. Of course some packers may say that the poor should 
not do this, but in ignorance it is done, and the .=nggcstion offered 
Ts worthy of consideration. 



160 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

There are always a number of persons ready to take it up and 
rush into prominence with such bills as "Canned Goods Dating 
Bill" to correct the reported evils. There never was anything 
more absurd than a dating bill for canned goods, but should a 
ptomaine be present by any possible chance, a date on the can 
would not Avam the consumer. 



AGE DOES NOT AFFECT CANNED GOODS. 

From Canner, March 2, 1905. 

Plate 49 shows a can of tomatoes which was put up 
in 1884. The tomatoes are as good as the day they were canned. 
While the exterior of this can was verv much rusted, the inside 
coating was perfect and w^as no doubt a very superior grade of 
tin plate. Age does not affect canned goods unless a perforation 
should happen to be made in the tin. So long as the air is kept 
awav, the contents will remain in an unfermented condition. 

From time to time there have been rumors of laws to de- 
clare the date of the pack on tin cans in various states, the idea 
being to limit the sale of canned goods to the year immediately 
following the pack. This would be very unjust because, as we 
say, canned goods are unaffected so long as the container prevents 
the germs from the air from gaining entrance. We have opened 
canned goods of various ages, ranging from five to twenty years, 
and have found that in everv case where the tin was not oer- 
forated. the contents were perfectly good and tasted as well as 
the freshly canned product. American canned goods are the best 
and most wholesome food in the world.

INTRODUCTION. 



The study of putrefactive processes and the bacteria asso- 
ciated therewith leads up to the products elaborated by these 
groups. There are various products which are formed during the 
growth and multiplication of these bacteria, but the most important 
ones are ptomaines and toxins. These substances are not formed 
in canned goods unless there are leaks or they are imperfectly steri- 
lized, although it has been charged against them quite frequently. In 
order to understand the nature of these substances and the bacteria 
which produce them, I have thought it advisable to describe the 
well known species. 

The general character of contaminated raw material is care- 
fully described, so that the manufacturer may be continually on 
his guard. A fair understanding of the subject may reduce to a 
minimum the chance of ptomaine poisons forming in manufactured 
foods of all kinds. The study of this subject will be interesting 
to the food chemist as well. 



PUTREFACTION. 



Sulphuretted hydrogen (HgS) is a foul gas usually present 
during putrefactive processes. It has the sickening odor of rotten 
eggs and is produced by a long list of bacteria. Albuminoid sub- 
stances are rich in sulphur compounds and the sulphur is easily 
liberated and combines with nascent hydrogen to form the gas. 
Bacteria cannot form this gas where sulphur is not present, which 
accounts for its absence where well known putrefactive bacteria 
are cultivated in certain nutrient media. The putrefactive bacteria 
use considerable sulphur in building up the protoplasm of their 
cells and the gas is formed only in small quantities in some cases. 



162 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

Sulphur combines with ammonia and in some cases the, ga.s is not 
liberated in sufficient quantities to be easily detected. This is in- 
teresting in connection with the protluction oPp^ornaineSj, as. it 
shows that iinperceivcd decomposition may take place in albumi- 
noid substances an<i poison may be produced by bacteria in suffi- 
cfent amounts to cause severe sickness, and even death, there being 
little or no evidence of any decomposition. The ordinary person 
depends largely upon his sense of sniel! to determine the decom- 
position of such foods as meat, fish, milk, cheese, etc., but it is 
generally the case where there is no perceptible decomposition that 
decei\-es because very few persons would eat any food that had a 
suggestion of putrefaction. The custom in some countries of ]>cr7 
mitting meats to age in order to soften the fiber must not be con- 
founded with putrefaction. 



Plate SO. Proteus Sulphur 



Sulphuretted hydrogen is not easily perceived in the_decon> 
position of albuminoid substances where nitrates are present, as 
these are reduced by the hydrogen to nitrites, both by aerobic and 
anaerobic bacteria. The presence of this gas is easily demonstrated 
in cultures nf putrefactive bacteria by a simple and beautiful chem- 
ical reaction. Gelatin plates are colored Madeira yellow with 
(sodium ferri-tartrate 0.5 gram, water 50 c.c. and carbonate of 
soda added until alkaline) ; this combines with the sulphur and 
forms ferrous sulphate and a black halo or ring may be seen around 



DECOMPOSITION CAUSED BY MICRO-ORGANISMS. 163 

each colony of bacteria which produce sulphuretted hydrogen. It 
may be stated here that peptone added to the gelatin insures a 
more liberal production of the gas. 

Nearly all pathogenic bacteria (bacteria which causes diseases 
of man and animals), form this gas; the typhoid bacillus produces 
sufficient quantities to be detected in a close room. 

The bacillus which causes swine erysipelas produces more gas 
than any other I have met; a bouillon culture resembles yeast fer- 
mentation in the amount of gas bubbles liberated. 

It must not be supposed that sulphuretted hydrogen is the 
only gas associated with putrefaction; there are various others; 
but Its absence must not be taken as a guarantee that there is no 
piitrefaction. 

Putrefactive processes occur in the intestines of man, .animals ' 
and birds. In man the large intestine is where this phenomenon 
takes place, and while putrefactive bacteria are not necessary, they 
find their way to that location, being introduced with food and 
water. The principal species is the Bacillus coli communis or 
Colon Bacillus, which resemble the Bacillus typhi abdominalis to 
such remarkable exactness that difterentiation is difficult. The un- 
digested albuminoids are attacked by this and other common putre- 
factive bacteria and those foul products known as indol, skatol, 
tyrosine, leucine, valeric acid, etc., are formed. . Various poisons 
are formed also, but usually pass away without causing any danger- i 
ous complications. 

There are a number of bacteria associated with putrefaction 
which produce ptomaines and toxic poisons in ordinary articles of 
food, such as meat, eggs, milk, ice cream, fish, cheese, etc., many 
of which have been isolated and their poisonous products have been 
separated. It must not be supposed that all putrefactive bacteria 
produce these poisons. They all produce enzymes of various kinds ; 
some are poisons, while others are quite harmless. There are some 
ptomaines also which are not poisons, and to speak of all ptomaines 
as such, is a mistake which has only recently been cleared up. Put- 
rescine and Cadaverine are two which were formerly considered as 
poisons, but recent investigation has proved the opposite. 

Some of the pathogenic bacteria produce ptomaines which act as 
powerful poisons ; many of the toxins have been separated and in- 
vestigators are working to obtain these principles from all disease- 
producing bacteria. Some diseases formerly thought to be incurable 
have been successfully treated with the specific toxins of the bac- 
teria which cause them. Among these might be mentioned, the 
anti-toxin obtained from cultures of Diphtheria Bacilli, which effects 
wonderful cures of diphtheria, and recently the tetano-tt^xin ob- 
tained from cultures of Tetanus Bacilli has effected cures of lock- 



164 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

jaw when all hope of recovery by other means had been given up. 
These toxins, however, are not used in the pure state, which would 
prove fatal, but are attenuated by inoculating animals from which 
the weakened toxin is obtained in the serum. 

Pathogenic bacteria will i^roduce poisons on nutrient substances 
whick have no albumen in their conipo^tion; these poisons are 
formed synthetically. These poisons have been named active al- 
buminoids by the investigators who made the discovery. They re- 
semble enzymes and have the power to decompose certain sub- 
stances characteristically just the same as the ferment deposited 
by the yeasts. These active albimiens are destroyed by 212^ F. 
and become passive. 

This discovery is valuable to the manufacturer of food pro- 
ducts, since it throws a flood of light on many cases of poisoning 
blamed on canned goods. Many people eat uncooked meat in the 
so-called "cannibal sandwiches," smoked sturgeon and halibut, and 
m the same meal eat caimed goods. If poisoning results, too often 
the blame is fastened on them, which causes considerable criticism 
of canned goods. Pathogenic organisms find their way into milk 
and on some raw vegetables, due to sprinkling with contaminated 
water, and the active albumen formed often causes severe cramps 
and even death. Cholera infantum is probably the result of con- 
taminated milk; indeed, the common potato bacillus, Mesentericus 
Vulgatus, is capable of causing severe intestinal complications where 
milk containing it is given to infants in nursing. 

There have been cases of ptomaine poisoning, however, which 
could possibly be traced to canned goods. There have been and 
possibly are today packers of canned goods who either are ignorant 
of the danger of canning unsound products or else they are un- 
scrupulous. Such men cause a great deal of trouble to the industry 
as a whole, for all must suffer the severe criticisms of the press and 
must battle against unjust legislation. A National Canner's As- 
sociation could put a stop to such practices. 

I know personally one packer of meats and sausages who was 
arrested a number of times for attempting to use contaminated 
material. "Xo one would known the difference after ii is canned." 
was his expression. There is no telling how much trouble this 
man may have caused, and it would hardly be supposed that there 
were no cases of poisoning where his goods were marketed. He 
used fictitious labels and covered his name so that it would be 
difficult to trace any complaints. 

Such men should be forced to either put up wholesome goods 
under their own names or be compelled to get out of the business, 
and to accomplish this the law demanding the name of the manu- 
facturer to be printed on his labels is wise and beneficial. There 



DECOMPOSITION CAUSED BY MICRO-ORGANISMS. 163 

would be no advantage in dating such goods, for unsound goods 
could not be detected bx a date on the can. 

There should be great care exercised in the selection of all 
raw material, especially such as contains albumen and is liable to 
putrefaction. There are means of knowing when raw material isi 
good, both from general appearance and microscopical examination. 
F.very canner should possess a good microscope, with an improved 
oil immersion lens. 

There are a number of bacteria associated with meat poisoning 
which we will now describe, and these may be studied carefully, 
as the plates and descriptions will serve as a guide and reference. 

One of the most common germs which produces a ptomaine is 
Projeus Vulgaris, found in {putrefying meat. The rods are gener- 
ally found in pairs. They measure 0.9 — 1.211 in length, 0.4 — 0.6/* 
in breadth, but occasionally forms are seen 6fi long and they fre- 
quently form threads (100 fj- long) wdien cultivated in nutrient ge- 
latin. Spirilla, or curved threads, spirulina, or twisted threads, 
are also seen in gelatin cultures. Involution forms with swelled 
ends resembling dumb-bells and lemons are met with. The colonies 
on gelatin show the twisted and straight threads growing out from 
the center and these sometimes move out into the gelatin, becom- 
ing detached, so that the name of "Swarming Islands*' had been 
given to them. The detached colonies sometimes resemble curious 
designs and figures and the name of "Bacillus figurans'* has been 
given the germ on account of this peculiarity. 

It is aiVftctively motile organism on account of the large num- 
ber of flagella it possesses which radiate from the whole surface 
of the celL 

The motion is seen to be in two directions; it turns on its 
long axis and moves rapidly forward at the same time. There is . 
no spore formation and the cell life is easily destroyed by a moist 
temperature of 150° F. ; in fact 135° F. kills it in a few minutes. 
It is a facultative anaerobe and grows well at 70° to 98° F., best 
at 75° to 80° F. It is stained well with carbol fuchsin, but Gram's 
method is negative. 

On Gelatin Plates it forms small, round, yellowish colonies 
with thick centers, with the peculiarities before mentioned. The 
Gelatin is rapidly liquefied, both in plate and stab cultures. 

On Agar a moist gray layer is formed, spreading rapidly over 
the entire surface. 

On Potato a grayish coating forms. 

Bouillon is uniformly clouded. Milk is coagulated and made 
faintly acid. It produces large quantities of sulphuretted hydrogen 
and forms indol; grows well in the presence of hydrogen and 
carbonic acid, and the odor from all media is abominable.

Proteus Vulg^ariSy Hauser 

Origin. — It is very widely distributed ; is commonly present in the 
putrefaction of anvmal proteins ; has also been found in water, in ^lecon- 
ium, in purulent abscesses, and in the blood and tissues of several cases 
of fatal putrid infection of the intestines. 

Form. — Rods varying in length from short oval forms to those which 
are two to six times as long as wide. Grows in pairs, is usually bent; 
sometimes forms twisted, interwoven threads. Roundi^h involution forms 
are commonly found. 

Motility. — ^Actively motile, with from sixty to one hundred flagella, 
arranged all over the surface. 

Sporulation. — Not observed. Cultures are resistant to dcssication and 
retain vitality for many months. 

Anilin Dyes. — Stain readily. Will not stain by Gram"s*niethod. 

Croicth. — Very rapid. 

Gelatin Plates. — Gelatin is rapidly and extensively liquefied. The 
colonies are of a yellowish-brown color, having bristly borders ; in soft 
gelatin they have a tendency to spread over the surface, forming peculiar 
figures. Detached portions of the colonies may be observed to move 
about, which has gained for them the name of "swarming islands." A 
disagreeable odor is noticeable. They have an alkaline reaction. 

Stab Culture. — Liquefaction extends along the entire line of inocula- 
tion; it is very rapid, and the whole contents are liquefied in a few days. 
The liquid, which is at first diffusely cloudy, clears up later and a flocculent 
sediment settles on the bcltom. At the same time a grayish-white layer 
is formed on the top. 

Streak Culture. — On agar, a grayish, slimy, rapidly spreading growth 
is formed. On potato, it forms a dirty colored, sticky covering. 

O.vygen Requirements — It is a faculative anaerobe. 

Temperature. — The optimum i> between so*' and 24** C. ; it grows very 
well in the incubator. 

Behai'ior to Gt latin. — Liquefies rapidly. 

.ierogcnesis. — Hydrogen sulphide is formed. 

Pathogenesis. — It has no effect in small doses. Toxic effects and 
even death, arc produced by the injection of large quantities of living or 
filtered in rabbits and guinea-pigs. It is toxicogenic and sometimes may 
be pathogenic. 

This and several related are include ci in the Bacterium termo of the 
older writers.

Pathogenesis. Animals, when subject to intravenous injec- 
tions of Proteus cultures, die of acute enteritis and peritonitis, pre- 
viously exhibiting typical symptoms of poisoning, such as bloody 
vomiting and diarrhoea, combined with severe tremors and feverish 
temperature. 

The toxiii is no doubt of a poisonous nature and is not de- 
stroyed by heat, even after the bacilli have perished. Patients 
suffering from "Weil's disease'' are afflicted with this parasite, 
which may be obtained from the pus and urine. 

PROTEUS MIRABIUS. 

Proteus Mirabilis greatly resembles the organism just describ- 
ed, yet has distinct characteristics. The rods are various lengths, 
closely resembling vulgaris, but the threads are much longer, often 
attaining a length of 200/*. They are- motile and possess many! 
flagella. Spore formation is absent. The Gelatin plates and stab' 
cultures are slowly liquefied. The deep colonies from curiously 
twisted masses or zooglea. 

Large quantities of sulphuretted hydrogen are formed. Cul- 
tures show a decided indol reaction; milk is coagulated with faint 
acid reaction. Bacilli grow fairly well in an anaerobic state, either 
in hydrogen or carbonic acid gas. They are found in putrefactive 
processes and produce a toxin similar in its pathogenic effects to 
that elaborated by Proteus Vulgaris. The odor produced when 
cultivated on all nutrient media is verv foul. 

PROTKUS ZKNKERI. 

Proteus Zenkeri, called by some authors Bacterium Zopfii, is 
a bacillus o.4i^ broad and about i.^fj. long, resembling the two pre- 
ceding species, but it is smaller and does not liquefy gelatin. It 
occasionally forms "Swarming Islands" like the other two and the 
other biological characteristics are similar. It is a peritrichous 
(many flagella) organism and produces a specific poison. 

These three germs belonging to the Proteus family are re- 
markable for their rapid boring movements. They swarm through 
media which are solid enough to confine most motile bacteria. Our 
readers will be able from these descriptions and plates to recognize 
any of them under the micro^^cope either in plates or in stained 
preparations. Other bacteria associated with Ptomaine and Toxic

gium. The peculiar symptoms exhibited by the unfortunate vic- 
tims of the botuHnus group of bacteria, are nervousness of central 
origin, disturbances in the muscular system, the salivary and other 
secretions are suspended; difficulty in swallowing; hoarseness, my- 1 
driasis and ptosis, and death sometimes follows. The^ origin of \ 
^*botu]ism!lJia&-been traced to contaminated salt fish, smoked meat, 
such as hanij preserved meats^ blood and liver sausages, etc. 

Bacilli botulini are seen under the microscope as large motile 
rods measuring 4 to 6fj- long and 0.9 to 1.2/t in thickness, having 
rounded ends. Various involution (odd shaped) forms are some- 
times seen. Threads are rarelv formed, thougfh sometimes three 
to ten rods will remain united. 

When properly stained four to eight flagella can be counted, 
which give the bacillus a creeping motion. It stains readily with 
nearly all colors, and also by Gram's method (see article on stain- 
ing) where alcohol is not used to excess. 

It forms spores which are ellipsoidal and are situated in the 
ends of the rods (terminal spores). They are rarely median. 

The vegetating forms are killed in boiling tiemperature 212° 
F., but the spores are more resistant. 250° F. kills them in a 
verv few minutes. 

Bacillus botulinus is anaerobic and grows well at 75° to 85° 
F^ but w:ill grow without sporulation at 98"^ F. Involution forms 
appear at blood temperature. The best artificial media for culti- 
vation are made slightly alkaline with an addition of 2 per cent, 
grape sugar. It produces butyric acid and a toxic poison which 
can be precipitated in almost pure state by treating a bouillon cul- 
ture with absolute alcohol, neutral salts and tannic acid. 

Gelatin plate culture; round, transparent, brow^nish yellow 
colonies make their appearance in four or five days. These colonies 
have a thick, lustrous, granulated appearance, slightly liquefying 
the surrounding gelatin. When magnified sixty times the margins 
appear slightly irregular and radiating. In the stab cultures the 
course of the needle shows a white growth extending into the sur- 
rounding gelatin, which is liquefied with the evolution of consider- 
able gas. 

Grape Sugar Bouillon is clouded very much; in milk there is 
no coagulation and it remains unaltered. 

Pathogenesis — Guinea pigs, cats, mice and dogs are killed by 
inoculation with the poison and also with the pure cultures. The 
nerve centers are greatly affected, principally the medulla oblongata, 
the ganglion of the hypolossal nerve, the dorsal ganglion of the 
vagus, the small-celled ganglion of the motores oculorum and 
brain nerves.

Bacillus Zenker! 

Origin. — Found in intestines of chickens; also in feces, water and 
putrefying substances. 

Form. — Rods, two to five times as long as wide. Threads are formed; 
in gelatin they are often bent or twisted in peculiar shapes, resembling 
spirals. Coccus-like involution forms abound in old cultures. 

Motility. — Actively motile. 

SporuJation. — Involution forms arc found which resemble spores. 
These are said to resist dessication, but are easily destroyed by heat, and 
stain readily with arilin dyes.

tube, but none in the lower part ; tine radiating lines penetrate into the 
gelatin, most deeply at or near the surface. 

Streak Culture. On agar, a very thin, dry, grayish growth is formed. 

O.vygen Requirements. — It is an obligative anaerobe. 

Temperature. — Grows best at ordinary temperature. Will grow at 37^ 
to 40^ C. but has a tendency to develop involution forms and to die out.

Pathogenesis. Produces a ptomaine. 



DECOMPOSITION CAUSED BY MICRO-ORGANISMS. 175 

Bacillus botulimis is sometimes found in putrefying meat, g:en- 
eraliy in the lean parts, seldom in the fat, and is able to flourish ' 
when the surface is covered with the aerobic putrefactive bacteria, 
which use up the oxygen and make the conditions favorable within 
the tissue for the development of anaerobic species. 

This bacilhis is particularly dangerous from the fact that jt 
forms spores which will. live throug;h pickling and smoking pro- 
cesses and will afterward develop. Van Ermengem discovered the 
baciiius in a ham which had poisoned a number of people. 

Albuminotis foods, if properly handled in the raw state, will 
not suffer from this organism. Exposure to putrefaction is dan- 
gerous.

bacilll:s ENTERITIDIS. 



Bacillus enteritidis belongs to the Coli group. It was discov- 
ered in 1888 by Gartner in a meat poisoning epidemic. He ob- 
tained it from the tissue of a cow, which died of mucous diarrhoea, 
and from the spleen of a man who had died from eating its 
flesh. It is morphologically identical with the Bacterium Coli Dys- 
entericum, which has been proved to be the cause of epidemics of 
dysentery. 

Bacillus enteritidis has been found to be the cause of many 
cases of poisoning; from meats: it appears as rods 2 to 41^ long and 
0.4 to 0.6/1 broad. The ends are rounded and are refractive, 
especially when the organism is cultivated on gelatin and examined 
in the hanging drop culture. It possesses five to ten flagella and

is motile, (This is denied by Lehman and Neumann.) Their error 
is possibly due to investigating old cultures. Cultures twenty-four 
hours old show a true independent motion and flagella can be de- 
monstrated by the method of staining (described in Chapter III). 
The rods stain more deeply in the middle than in the ends,, due to 
their richness in fat of alkaline nature. An even stain may be 
made by first treating the germs with a 20 per cent, solution of 
Sulphuric. Acid, H2SO4, which neutralizes the alkaline, and the 
stain takes quite readily afterwards. Gram's method is negative. 

It grows well in temperatures ranging from 70° to 100° F., 
best.at c>8° F, Gelatin Plates show the superficial colonies as thin, 
almost transparent films, and there is no liquefaction of the gelatin, 
either in plates or Stab Culture. There is very little odor in any 
of the culture media.

but the same gases are formed less abundantly. 

MILK is not coagulated nor changed chemically. Young cul- 
tures do not form indol ; old cultures show slight traces. It is an

PATHOGENESIS. — When this organism grows on meat a 
powerful ptomaine poison is found whicii heat does not destroy. 
Even the broth from such meat will contain the poison. The poison 
may be precipitated with absolute alcohol, tannic acid and neutral 
salts, if acid is present. 

Live cultures of the germs when inoculated subcutaneously in- 
to small animals cause death in three to eight days. Intravenous 
injections of the ptomaine result the same. Infected meat fed 
to animals causes intense gastro-enteric cramps and death. These 
Tymptoms are the same in man. This form of meat poisoning 
follows the consumption of meat obtained front diseased animals. 

Owing to the imperceptible decomposition set up by bacillus 
enteriditis it is indeed a dangerous organism. It may be present in 
ham sausage and fresh meat without any outward indication of its 
presence. The milk obtained from diseased animals may contain 
the germs and to all appearances it may seem good. Canners of 
meat are menaced by such an organism and need inspectors to 
examine all meat that is used. The same applies to the canners of 
assorted soups, where meat is used for the stock. Manufacturers 
of these goods ought to have a man to inspect and examine micro- 
scopically all meats used. 

Not all cases of gastro-enteric disturbances prove fatal or 
even serious. Nearly every person, at times, is subject to these, 
and it is safe to say that ptomaines are responsible in fully one- 
third of the cases, but the causes are not understood and are passed 
by. It is only when severe cases are brought to the attention of 
the public that any criticisms are published. Ptomaines are most 
frequently formed in raw material bought in the open market. 
Eternal vigiliance is the only safeguard for the manufacturers who 
use albuminous material. It is well to state here that such dis- 
turbances as we have described mav result from other causes: 
overheating incompatible foods, and drinking too much liquor often 
cause complications of this nature. 

BACILLUS MORBIFICANS BOVIS. 

This organism was isolated by Basenan from the tissue and 
spleen of a cow which died of puerperal fever. It is biologically 
and morphologically the same as the Bacterum of swine cholera. 
Ostertag found that ptomaine poisoning was produced where the 
flesh of cows affected with puerperal fever had been eaten. 

It is an actively motile organism, having 8 to 14 flagella, the 
rods measuring 0.3 to 0.4/tx broad and i to 1.2/* long, generally 
united in pairs. (It resembles the typhoid bacillus). Spore for- 
mation has not been observed. It stains readily with all ordinary 
dyes, but Gram's method is negative. 



DECOMPOSITION CAUSED BY MICRO-ORGANISMS. 179 

Colonies on gelatin and agar resemble those of Bacterium coli, 
but have a more granular appearance. Gelatin is not liquefied. 
Agar stab cultures have white tufts. Bouillon is clouded and a 
thin pellicle is formed on the top. Cultures on sterile potato are 
yellow and moist and do not darken. Milk is not coagulated. 
Grape sugar is slightly fermented with two gases liberated. Carbonic 
acid and Hydrogen. Cane sugar is not fermented, Indol and 
Phenol are not formed. The bacillus is killed at boiling tempera- 
ture and even at i6o° F,, but the ptomaine is not so destroyed. 
Both the meat and the milk from diseased cows will retain the 
jK)rsQii. Very small animals are killed by inoculation or from eat- 
ing the flesh ; dogs and cats are not affected. The same precautions 
we have mentioned previously will prevent poisoning from this 
saprophyte.

and thicker than the tubercle bacillus. Usually single, but may grow in 
pairs or in short threads. 

Motility. — Marked Brownian motion. 

Sporulaiion. — Bright bodies, considered by Loeffler as the first indi- 
cation of degeneration, are often found in the cells, but real spores have 
not been found. It is not very resistant to dessication. 

Anilin Dyes. — It stains unevenly and is rapidly decolored. Carbolic 
fuchsin, alkaline aniline gentian violet, or anilin fuchsin, stain well, es- 
pecially when warmed. Does not stain by Gram's method. 

Growth. — Grows best at relatively high temperature. Rapid. Grows 
best on glycerin agar. 

Plates. — Excellent colonies form in a day or two on glycerin agar at 
.37*. The colonies are round, grayish and glistening, having smooth sharp 
borders and with granular contents. Colonies cannot be obtained on gel- 
atin, as a rule. 

Stab Culture. — Develops very slowly in gelatin ; can be made in gly- 
cerin agar. 

Streak Culture. — On glycerin agar a thick, moist, slimy growth is 
formed. On potato it forms a thin, transparent, amber-colored growth, 
which later becomes a reddish-brown. On blood-serum yellowish, trans- 
parent spots are formed ; these later run together, yielding a slimy, whitish 
growth. 

Bouillon. — Grows readily and abundantly, with diffuse cloudiness; ring 
of slime on the surface. Mallein is the filtered bouillon of the glanders 
bacillus. It is analogous to tuberculin. 

In milk and acid reaction is produced. 

Oxygen Requirements. — It is a facultative anaerobe. 

Temperature. — Grows best at about yj'^ C. Does not grow readily 
above 42° or below 25° C. 

Behavior to Gelatin. — There is very slight growth at first, but may be- 
come accustomed to growth at room temperature later. 

Attenuation. — Takes place rapidly w^hen grown on artificial media. 
If the bacillus is not frequently passed through an animal the virulence 
is lost and the organism may die out. 

Immunity. — Intravenous injections of small amounts of bouillon cul- 
ture render dogs immune. 

Pathogenesis. — Man, horse, ass, goats, cats, guinea-pigs and field- 
mice are highly susceptible. Cattle, hogs, ordinary and white mice are 
immune. Dogs, rabbits and sheep arc slightly susceptible. White mice 
fed with phlorid/in become susceptible. On inoculation susceptible ani- 
mals develop typical glanders. In guinea-pigs death will result in four 
to eight weeks. Field mice die within a few days. Enlarged lymphatics, 
nodules in liver, spleen, etc. Bacilli are present. 

Infection. — May occur through wounds — inoculation glanders. A man 
was accidentally and fatally inoculnted with a pure culture in one instance. 
The usual source of infection in horses is probably along the respiratory 
tract.

gp-anules, which are not spores, although some authors have erred 
in so stating. The rods generally appear singly with rounded ends. 
Pairs are sometimes seen and rarely threads. Sometimes branch- 
ing threads are seen in old cultures. The bacillus stains somewhat 
difficultly with ordinary dyes and Gram's method is negative. It 
greatly resembles the Diphtheria bacillus in staining on account 
of the granules before mentioned. 

It is aerobic, facultative, anaerobic: grows at any tempera- 
ture between yy^ P. and io8° P., best at blood heat, on 5 per cent, 
glycerine agar. 






Plate 60. Bacillus Mallei 

Photoniicro£r«ph of Bacillus mallei, showing bright, shining granules, resembling spores. Stained with 
Loeffier's menthyline blue. Magnified 1,000 diameters. 

A characteristic growth is exhibited on sterile potato at 98° 
P., when moist amber-colored patches make their appearance ; these 
deepen to a red brown and become thicker, sometimes forming in- 
terlaced threads. The surface surrounding the growths turns quite 
dark. Acid is produced in media containing grape or milk sugar. 
Bouillon is made slightly cloudy with a sediment (and a trace of 
indol). Milk is coagulated slowly and separated into casein and 
clear w^hey, owing to the production of acid. No gas is formed 
from carbohydrates. 

The Bacillus Mallei is destroyed at 2i2°F. in a few minutes, 
but the specific poison is still virulent. This toxin has been separated 
by filtration and is called Mallcin and is analogous by the tuber-

culin of the tubercle bacillus obtained bv Dr. Koch of Berlin. Mai- 
lein is used in cases of glanders as a cure and gives good results 
in early stages of the disease. It is also used as a means of 
diagnosis of glanders in animals. 

Sheep and pigs are susceptible and should these be slaughtered 
and the meat be consumed, severe cases of poisoning would result. 
The poison would remain virulent in the meat even after cooking 
or canning. Pork is used largely in the preparation of canned 
pork and beans. Great care and judgment should be exercised in 
the selection of the pork. Good pork has a firm and healthy 
appearance in the pickle and the presence of bruises, soft spots or 
disease growths should immediately condemn it as not fit to use. 
Do not cut out the bad parts and use. the piece, but refuse the whole 
tierce if there are any such characteristics. Some packers are tem- 
pted to use inferior pork, because the price is a few cents less per 
pound. Use only select pork and the general appearance will be a 
good indication of its wliolesomeness. Of course, the microscope 
should be used constantly to determine the character of the albumin- 
ous material used in canning, and this applies to the examination 
of pork particularly, in the detection of bacteria as well as the 
deadly trichinae. 

Our readers have now become acquainted with some of the 
germs which produce ptomaines and toxins, but there remain a 
few belonging to the Pathogenic class, which are at times epidemic 
and are familiar to everyone as the cause of special diseases. Their 
description and biological characters will be interesting, not only in 
connection with out subject at hand, but also from a bacteriological 
standpoint. 

OTHER PATHOGENIC BACTERIA ASSOCIATED WITH PUTREFACTION 

AND FOOD POISONING. 

There are a number of bacteria which are pathogenic but are 
able to grow on certain food and in water, where they form poisons 
which are nearly related to ptomaines. Some of them form toxins 
which act as poisons and these may be formed in food which seems 
to be wholesome in every respect. It often happens that the bac- 
teria are carried in the food and cause epidemics of disease, and 
the description of several common varieties will be interesting to 
the student of foodstuff for this reason. 



; TYPHOID BACILLUS. 



This organism was discovered by Eberth in the internal organs 
of persons who had died of typhoid fever. The bacillus was ob- 
served by Dr. Koch in the typhoid abscesses and he made photomi-

crographs of it. The typhoid bacillus is particularly interesting to 
the student of bacteriology and may be obtained in pure cultures 
in the manner we shall describe later (article on plate culture). 

It occurs as short plump rods with rounded ends, singly, some- 
times in pairs, and when grown oh potato in threads. It measures 
from I to 3At long and 0.5 to 0.9/A broad. It grows on agar well 
at J38° F. and Jhis. culture gives, the most satisfactory results for 
flagella stajning. Bright shining spots are seen at the ends oi the 
bacillus and these were thought to be spores by Gafifky, but such 
is not the.case. 

It is actively motile, possessing eight to eighteen flagella, which 
gi\^e the short rods a wonderfully rapid motion. It travels very 
fast, turning somersaults. The flagella are long and wavy and 
grow out from the whole surface of the bacillus. The isolation of 
tjie baciUi and the proper staining of their flagella is a beautiful 
bacterilogical test of skill, and when successftilly achieved fits the 
student for the most complicated work. Plate 61 is photographed 
from a slide prepared from an agar culture and the flagella are 
stained by the author's niethod. 

The typhoid bacillus stains well with carbol fuchsin and gentian 
violet, but with other dyes the rods do not stain as readily as many 
other germs. Gram's staining method is negative. The bacilli 
grow in clumps in the tissues and spleen and when stained thus 
should remain for one day in Loeffler's methylene blue or Ziehl's 
carbol fuchsin and then washed in distilled water. Methylene blue 
fades after a time, so the carbol fuchsin or gentian violet is pre- 
ferable. 

The typhoid bacillus is aerobic, and does not liquify gelatin. 
It grows well upon nearly all nutrient media at room, temperature, 
biit most luxuriantly at blood heat in an incubator. It will grow as 
an anaerobe also and thrives fairly well in the presence of CO2 
(carbonic acid gas). 

BOUILLON CULTURE.— QomWon is clouded, becoming 
slightly acid, and there is a quantity of sediment formed from 
which Brieger obtained in 1884 a ptomaine which he named Typho- 
toxin C7 Hi7 NOg. This ptomaine forms in considerable quantity 
in a test tube kept at 98° F. for one week. This ptomaine is 
strongly alkaline. Typhotoxin produces salivation, rapid respira- 
tion, dilation of the pupils, diarrhoea and death when given to small 
animals such as guinea pigs. The experiments have not been tried 
on man, but Brieger believes that the specific action of the typhoid 
bacillus in tpyhoid fever is due to the production of the ptomaine. 

MILK CULTURE,— The bacillus grows well in milk and 
forms some acid, but does not cause coagulation, hence its presence 
is not easily detected. The ptomaine is formed, however, and has

BACILLUS OF TYPHOID FEVER/ KOCH-EBERTh's BACILLUS. 

Origin. — It was first obtained from the spleen and lymphatic glands of 
typhoid fever cadavers. It is present in the blood in small numbers; also 
in the feces and urin of typhoid patients. 

Form. — Rather large rods, two to three times as long as wide, with 
rounded ends. The length depends upon the medium on which it grows. 
On agar the rods are short; on potato long threads appear. Involution 
forms. 

Motility. — Actively motile, with numerous lateral flagella; fine giant 
whips. It may show very little or no motion on prolonged artificial cul- 
ture. 

Sporulation. — Round or oval terminal bodies occur in potato and agar 
cultures grown in the incubator for several days. They will not double 
stain, and the bacilli which contain them are very susceptible to heat. 
These are not true spores, but little masses of condensed protoplasm. 
The bacilli are very resistant to dessication, and may retain their vitality 
for months. 

Anilin Dyes. — Do not stain well. Carbolic fuchsin stains very well. 
Gram's method will not stain. 

Growth. — Is less rapid than that of the Colon Bacillus. It grows 
slowly at 16-18**. 

Plates. — On gelatin plates the deep colonies are small, round or oval, 
yellowish and finely granular, with sharp border. They sometimes show 
a dark portion or ring in the center. A protuberance may frequently be 
seen on the border, which is surrounded at times with delicate fibrils. 
The surface colonies form a spreading, almost transparent film, marked 
with delicate, branching lines, and having an irregular, wa\y border. 
There, is no liquefaction. 

Stab Culture. — Growth is abundant along the entire line of inocula- 
tion; is especially so on the surface, spreading there as a thin, grayish 
white covering. Acids are produced which cloud the gelatin. 

Streak Culture. — On agar and on blood- scrum a white, moist growth 
is formed. On potato, a moist, invisible layer is formed. On alkaline 
potato the growth is yellowish ; not characteristic. 

Bouillon. — Is slightly cloudy, not so much so as with the Colon ba- 
cillus. There is very little deposit : scarcely any ring or film. Remains 
clouded for a long time. It will not grow in bouillon containing 20 c. c. 
of N HCL or 50 c. c. of N NaOH per liter, unlike the Colon bacillus. 
No indol is produced. In Uschinsky's medium there is no growth. 

Milk. — Is not coagulated. No gas is formed in glucose media; no 
acid in lactose media. 

Oxygen Requirements. — It is a facultative anaerobe. 

Temperature. — Grows best at 37° C. : also grows well at oi:dinary 
temperature. Is killed by exposure to moist heat of 60** C. 

Serogenesis. — No acid or gas production on lactose media. 

Behavior to Gelatin. — Does not liquefy. 

Immunity. — Injections of dead or living cultures yield an anti-infecti- 
ous serum; injections of the toxin yield an anti-toxic serum. The serum 
in the former case will give Pfeiffer's reaction with the Eberth, but not 
with the Colon bacillus. 

Pathogenesis. — Rabbits are usually killed by intravenous injections. 
It is usually fatal to guinea-pigs when injected into the duodenum or the 
peritoneal cavity or when introduced into the previously alkalized stomach. 
Guinea-pigs are killed bp subcutaneous injections also. Abscesses are pro- 
duced in dogs and rabbits by the same method of infection. It may pro- 
duce abscesses in man. Cultures killed with chloroform or by heating for 
one hour at 54** are fatal to guinea-pigs in doses of 3-4 m. g. per 100 g. 
body weight. 

/n/rc/iow.— Takes place commonly through the mouth by means of 
water, food, soiled articles, etc. It may be transmitted through the air as 
fine dust. Carried by flies and other insects.

been the cause of severe poisoning I have no doubt. Milk is a great 
carrier_ of the disease and many epidemics have been traced to 
it. The contamination is usually made through the water used in 
rinsing the pails^ especially if the water is obtained from wells or 
springs where the bacilli have found entrance. Many farm wells 
are close to closets and cesspools and become contaminated froni 
the faecal matter of tjrphoid patients. Epidemics have been traced 
directly to this source and there are official records of a number. In 
1870 Ballard investigated the epidemic in Islington, where 167 peo- 
ple contracted the disease, and the investigation led to the discovery 
that the milk used by these people was obtained from a farm where 
the well was contaminated by rat holes connecting with the closet. 
The farmer had a case of typhoid fever and the well water was 
used to rinse the pails. 

The fever broke out in the prisons at Strasburg in 1890, and 
the disease was traced to the milk supply, which came from a place 
where the fever was epidemic. Rowland, in 1892, found the living 
bacteria in what is known as **Dahi," which is an Indian milk 
comestible. 

Since milk is one of the principal ingredients of so many fine 
food products, especially of the cream soups, it is perhaps wise to : 
advise the use of *Tasteurized" milk, for this method destroys all 
such germs as the Typhoid bacillus long before they have oppor- 
tunity to multiply and form ptomaines. The great danger from 
using_ravv milk lies in the possible contamination by disease germs, 
and while these will be destroyed in the sterilizing process, the poi- 
son still remains in certain quantities, and may cause sickness vary- 
ing in violence according to the amount of poison present. Per- 
haps the amount of poison will be so slight as to cause no appre- 
hension, yet the food product will not give satisfaction. 

POTATO CULTURE.— A characteristic growth of the 
typhoid bacillus when planted on sterilized potato; it is almost in- 
visible and threads are formed which have a beautiful serpentine 
motion. The potato is generally slightly acid and this is favorable 
for a typical growth. 

GELATIN PLATE CULTURE,— The surface colonies are 
at first small and yellowish, punctiformed, becoming round and 
slightly notched and shining. The periphery is clear and trans- 
parent, slightly gray; the centers are opaque and slightly elevated. 
When magnified about seventy-five times young colonies are color- 
less and smooth bordered; later lines are visible like bands ex- 
tending from the center; these gradually deepen like folds and 
look like hen tracks. The colony has a golden yellow color and 
is very pretty. The deep colonies are whetstone in shape and yel- 
low, with smooth borders and slightly gray. 



188 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

AGAR CULTURE, — The surface colonies are irregularly 
round, smooth bordered, gray and shining, and when magnified ap- 
pears bright yellow in color, becoming darker towards the center 
with transparent edges. Dark irregular lines run out from the cen- 
ter and give the colony a beautiful appearance. The deep colonies 
are yellow and finely granular; they are opaque, whetstone shaped, 
looking something like an almond. The agar streak is even border- 
ed, slightly elevated and slightly gray, with a lustrous appearance. 
After a time the color changes to yellow. 

The study of this bacillus in cultures is most interesting and 
instructive and if care is exercised there need be no fear in cul- 
tivating and handling it. . There are so many points of interest con- 
nected with its life, its manner of growth and its behavior under 
certain conditions, that the study of its biological characteristics 
will enable the student to intelligently investigate any other or- 
ganism. 

Typhoid bacilli produce a poison which interferes .with their 
reproductive power, so that cultures will cease growing after a time 
and the bacilli will not be as actively motile as when planted in 
fresh nutrient media. When growing in the human body the poison 
is carried away in the blood and it is possible to determine quite 
early if the patient is attacked by the fever. The test is made 
with the serum from the blood and is called the agglutination 
test, which may be described as follows : A homogeneous sus- 
X)ension of the bacilli is made first. This is done by taking a plati- 
num loop full of the germs from a culture about one day old, which 
has grown on hard agar; the germs are loosened from one an- 
other by rubbing them against the side of a test tube containing 
I c.c. of bouillon. When there is a perfect separation and even 
distribution the mixture is termed a homogeneous suspension, and 
a small quantity must be examined imder the microscope with a 
magnification of 500 diameters to make sure that there are no 
clumps, and that all the bacilli are actively motile. This being 
ascertained, different dilutions are made of the blood serum, and 
each dilution is inoculated with typhoid bacilli. This is done on a 
cover-glass which is then inverted over a cell in a hollow-ground 
slide and sealed to avoid evaporation. The hanging drop is then 
placed in the incubator for various lengths of time, and occasional- 
ly removed and examined under the microscope to ascertain if 
the bacilli have gathered in bunches. If the blood has been taken 
from a typhoid patient, the agglutination is almost sure to take 
place even in weak dilutions. A positive aggultination is fairly 
conclusive evidence of enteric fever. See Plate 62. 

Persons who have had typhoid fever remain immune for a 
considerable time, and in some cases for life. Blood from such 



DECOMPOSITION CAUSED BY MICRO-ORGANISMS. 189 

persons sometimes gives a similar reaction as the blood from a 
typhoid fever patient, but not quite so marked, especially in the 
great dilutions. 

The examination of water to determine the presence of typhoid 
is quite difficult, because there is a class of bacteria called Coli 
commune (of which there are a number of species), which closely 
resemble the true typhoid bacilli. These species are found in thei 
faeces of healthy persons and water is usually condemned as unfit 
for drinking purposes, when any of these are found, because it in-* 
dicates that it is contaminated with sewage. 

The biological characteristics of the typhoid bacillus may be 
thus summed up: It is aerobic and facultative anaerobic, clouds 
bouillon, does not coagulate milk, and the reaction is amphoteric, 
does not form spores, is not chromogenic, produces sulphuretted 
hydrogen in abundance, ordinarily does not produce indol, produces 
some acid in grape-sugar-bouillon, produces no gas in sugar agar 
and grows fairly well in an atmosphere of carbonic acid gas. It 
produces a ptomaine which is a powerful poison. The study of this 
organism is most interesting to the food cliemist and investigator. 

Typhoid is commonly epidemic, and it is no doubt carried 
from one location to another in food and water, which gives it 
a place in the catalog of dangerous bacteria associated with food 
spoilage. 

CHOI.ERA BACIIXUS. 

The germ which produces Asiatic cholera is called by the fol- 
lowing names: Comma Bacillus, Vibrio cholera. Spirillum cholera 
and "Bacille vir gule" (French). The name comma bacillus was 
given to it on account of the bodies often seen at the end of the 
germs, which are incorrectly described by Huppe as arthrospores. 
The germination of these bodies has not been positively observed, 
but they cause the germ to look like a comma (,) hence the name. 

It is seldom that this terrible foe of man gets a strong hold 
in America, yet there have been some severe epidemics which car- 
ried whole families and communities out of existence in a few days. 
In various parts of Asia it is epidemic nearly all the time. It is 
said that in Saigon, Asia, there are always a few cases, and at 
times it spreads, carrying death to thousands. 

Not until 1884 was it known positively just what was the 
agent of this dreaded disease. Dr. Koch of Berlin made the dis- 
covery of the germ and showed how it was carried in water and in 
food from one place to another. Dr. Koch carried on his researches 
in Egypt and India, and other eminent bacteriologists, both from 
Europe and America, have made searching investigations of the 
micro-organism and have studied its biological characteristics to

sucli an extent that the disease is now combated with more success 
than formerly when tlie true cause was shrouded in mystery. 

The disease makes its appearance in every country occasional- 
ly, the specific organism being carried from infected districts by 
travelers, in articles of food and clothinjj, etc. The organism is 
one of the few which produces several ptomaines and toxic poisons, 
some of which are very dangerous. The specific action of these poi- 
sons are varied, and violent sickness and even death may result 
from them if taken in food which has been contaminated. Of 
course there is danger only when the disease is rife in certain lo- 
calities, and when food stuff is obtained from such places. 



The Cholera spirillum is a curved rod measuring from 0.8 to 
2/» in length and 0.3 to 0.4/* broad, the ends being rarely in the same 
plane, so that when several are united they resemble a corkscrew. 
When seen singly they resemble a comma and when seen in pairs 
may form the letter fS) or the letter (O). The (S) forms are 
quite common where the growth is rapid. The long corkscrew 
forms are seen generally in hanging drop cultures growing in favor- 
able temperatures or conditions. Old cultures assume varied forms, 
bearing little resemblance to young cultures. Involution forms 



DECOMPOSITION CAUSED BY MICRO-ORGANISMS. 191 

with spherical bodies are produced, which are thought to be spores 
belonging to the so-called anthrospore type of spore formation, but 
no one has observed the germination of these bodies. It is a motile 
organism having a single terminal flagellum; sometimes two flagella. 

Milk is a good medium for, growth and ts coagulated with the 
production of lactic acid. 

indol is formed abundantly in nutrient media containing pep- 
tone or albumen. The presence of indol in cultures may be demon- 
strated by adding a minute quantity of muriatic or sulphuric acid 
to the medium, when a rose-red color will make its appearance and 
is known as the nitrose indol reaction. In all cultures containing 
albumen indol is formed first and then the nitrates are converted into 
nitrites. This is also true of at least two other species of bacteria. 
All cultures of the cholera have a disagreeable, sickening odor, but 
these are not specially characteristic. 



Plate 64. Baclltua Coll Communis, showing Flagella 



Media containing either milk-grape or cane sugar favor the 
production of lactic acid, which is dextrorotatory. 

A beautiful chemical reaction is seen when cholera is grown in 
a test tube containing litmus milk; a pale blue pellicle is formed on 
the top, under which is a stratum of red, while the lower portion will 
be entirely decolorized. 

Sulphuretted hydrogen (HjS) is formed abundantly in peptone 
bouillon and also in sterilized egg albumen. Cholera germs are 
not very resistant to unfavorable conditions. They are killed in 
water heated to 130 degrees F., and when frozen they die within a

in my own researches I have been unable to make a clear distinction 
between any germs of this family. The Coli communis is_always 
present in intestines of healthy man and various animals* and is 
nearly always found associated with other bacteria in a number of 
diseases, such as suppurative processes in the internal organs, in- 
fectious enteritis, ulcerated liver, puerperal fever, meningitis, etc 

The bacillus resembles the typhoid bacillus so closely in its 
form, size and its growth on various culture media as to make its 
differentiation a nice bacteriological problem. 

The differences may be stated as follows : It is not so actively 
motile as typhoid, has fewer and shorter flagella, it develops more 
luxuriantly on all media, and the growth on potato is visible, while 
that of typhoid is not. It coagulates milk, giving marked acid 
reaction, while typhoid does not and the acid reaction is only slight 
It forms considerable gas in media containing glucose, lactose and 
saccharose. Colonies are pink on (alkaline) agar and gelatine 
media containing lactose and htmus tincture, while those of Typhoid 
are pale blue. 

It produces indol (in peptone solutions) more freely than 
typhoid. Typhoid as a rule does not produce indol, but it is some- 
times formed in peptone solutions. 

Agglutination test is generally negative. Pfeiffer's serum re- 
action with typhoid blood serum as described under typhoid is nega- 
tive with the Coli communis. 

Tyrotoxicon is supposed to be a poison formed by this microbe, 
although the evidence is not positive. In 1886 this poison was first 
discovered in milk which had poisoned a number of persons at Long 
Branch. The milk had been exposed to unusual conditions, favor- 
ing the growth of the Colon bacillus probably. Vaughan reported 
an interesting case of poison from tyrotoxicon, known as the Milan 
case. The symptoms were rapid pulse, breathing rapid, burning 
sensation in the throat and stomach, abdomen retracted and severe 
throbbing in the abdomen. The contamination of milk from germs 
which were present in decomposing matter under the floor was found 
to be the cause. Vaughan and Novy found the poison in numerous 
samples of poisonous ice cream and custard. Novy says that "Un- 
doubtedly there are many forms of the Colon bacillus which fre- 
quently find their way into milk and, on account of the toxins con- 
tained within their cells, they render this and various other foods, 
of which milk is a constituent, more or less poisonous." The potas- 
sium compound of tyrotoxicon is not decomposed in a temperature 
under 265 degrees F., so that foods containing milk and cheese 
which have been exposed in any way to human or animal excreta or 
to contaminated water are liable to have this poison formed by the 
Bacillus coli communis. The poison is present in the human 



DECOMPOSITION CAUSED BY MICRO-ORGANISMS. 195 

faeces, but ordinarily passes away without any serious results, as it 
fs formed past the danger line. 

Tyrotoxicon may be formed by other agents, but the accurate 
knowledge of its origin is not yet thoroughly investigated. It is 
a powerful poison and many fatalities have followed where food 
containing it has been eaten. It is generally found in milk, ice 
cream and cheese, from which it derives its name. 

TETANUS. 

Tetanus or lockjaw is a disease produced in man and nearly all 
domestic animals by a widespread germ found in garden soil, ma- 
nure heaps and saltpeter beds. The horse is the most susceptible 
dom.estic animal, but cows, sheep, pigs and goats are sometimes at- 
tacked. Man is very susceptible to this disease, which is considered 
to be one of the most dangerous and deadly. 

The germ produces several very powerful ptomaines, which 
have been isolated by Brieger in crystalline forms ; Tetanine, which 
decomposes in acid and remains unaltered in alkaline solutions, wilf 
in itself produce lockjaw when injected into the tissues of animals; 
tetanoxm, which produces tremors and paralysis, followed by con- 
vulsions; tetanotoxin, which induces lockjaw, accompanied by a flow 
of tears and saliva; and spasmotoxin, which produces spasms and 
convulsions. Late investigators have formed the opinion that the 
crystalline substances obtained by Brieger owed their poisonous 
properties to the toxin of tetanus and that they were not of them- 
selves poisons. 

The flesh of animals suffering from disease is apt to contain 
such elements, and if such flesh should be used in the preparation of 
food products, either in soups, extracts or canned meats, the direful 
results may be far reaching. Packers who use meats can thus un- 
derstand how necessary it is to be careful in their selection ; any un- 
natural appearances should be a suflicient reason for rejecting any 
lot of meat which they may be using. 

The poison of the tetanus germ has been used by natives of 
the New Hebrides, according to Ledantec, on arrowheads made of 
human bones, which they first cover with resin and smear with the 
slime found in swamps; the slime no doubt contains the tetanus 
bacilli in large numbers and even a slight wound from such weapons 
of warfare would prove fatal. 

The tetanus bacillus when magnified one thousand diameters is 
seen to be slender, with a large spore in the end of the rod which 
does not readily take a stain. In measures from 3 to 5 /x in length 
and 0.3 to 0.5 /* in width. In cultures it is seen to grow in threads 
and often appears without the spore, but usually the spore is present 
in single rods and gives the germ the appearance of a nail, from

TETANIS, lock-jaw; WUNDSTAkRKRAMPF (CERM.) ; TETANOS. (FR.) 

Origin. — It is found in animals that die of tetanus after inoculation 
with earth; in traumatic tetanus of man and animals; in head tetanus; 
tetanus of new-born; is present in the intestines. 

Form. — Large, narrow rods, having rounded ends; may form threads. 

Motility. — It is motile. Many curly flagella, also giant whips. 

Sporulation. — Spores are formed rapidly at 37°. Terminal spores 
are formed, with enlargemcnt-drum-sticks. 

Anilin Dyes. — Stain readily. Gram's method may be used. 

Groivth. — Slow. 

Plates. — Colonies develop in gelatin at ordinary temperature in four 
to seven days ; these resemble those of the Hay bacillus. The gelatin 
slowly liquefies, and gas is produced. On agar plates the colonies have 
the appearance of faint clouds ; when examined under the microscope these 
are seen to be oval, partially surrounded by a whorl of extremely fine 
threads. 

Stab Culture. — No growth at the upper part of the tube. In glucose 
gelatin tubes cultures show a cloudy growth along the line of inoculation, 
which radiates outward into the gelatin, resembling that of the Root ba- 
cillus. The gelatin is eventually liquefied. Gas bubbles are present. In 
glucose agar at 37° the growth is sometimes indistinct, showing radia- 
tions. 

Streak Culture. — On glucose agar growth is rapid and practically in- 
visible. 

Bouillon. — It becomes diffusely cloudy at y^'^, but after several days 
the growth settles to the bottom in the form of a scarcely visible sediment. 

Glucose Gelatin, colored with litmus. — Becomes permanently lique- 
fied at 37°, a very small sediment i<5 formed. The culture remains blue, 
thus sho^^ing that there is no acid formation. 

Milk. — Grows well in milk, but produces no change. Starch is not 
inverted. On potato, the growth is invisible. 

Oxygen Requirements. — It is an obligative anaerobe, growing in va- 
cuum, hj'drogen. carbonic acid and nitroqen. 

Tew.perature. — Grows best at about 38° C. Will not grow below 16° C. 

Behavior to Gelatin. — Liquefies. 

Aerogenesis. — Produces gas; has disagreeable odor; H2S. 

Attenuation. — There is a loss of virulence by culture. 

Immunity. — lodin trichlorid ; thymus bouillon cultures; injection of 
filtered cultures; of purified toxin: milk of immunized goat: blood-serum 
of rabbits, dogs, sheep, horses, which have been artificially immunized. 
The tetanus toxin is destroyed by the nucleohiston from the thymus gland. 

Pathogenesis. — Man, horse, sheep, young cattle, goats, guinea-pigs, 
white rats and white mice, are susceptible. Dogs and rabbits are less 
susceptible. Chickens and ducks, immune. It is not present in the blood, 
but occurs in small numbers at the point of inoculation; may be absent 
entirely at times. Products are intensely poisonous. A guinea-pig may 
be killed by 0.002 c. c. of a filtered bouillon culture and a dose of 0.0002 c. 
c. may kill a mouse. Disease cannot be produced by pure tetanus spores. 
Mixed infection. 

Infection. — Occurs through wounds. The poisoned arrows of the 
New Hebrides contain tetiuius and malignant edema spores. 

Diagnosis. — On account of its scarcity and the presence of other ae- 
robic and anaerobic bacteria, the bacillus is hard to detect. The pus should 
be taken from the womid by means of a sterile drawn-out glass tube 
pipette and transferred to glucose litmus gelatin. A loopful of this dilu- 
tion should then be transferred to each of eight or ten tubes of liquefied 
glucose agar. These should be poured into Petri dishes and developed in 
hydrogen. The characteristic colony is oval, surrounded on one end by a 
whorl of threads. 

The original gluco>e litmus gelatin is developed at 35**; a portion of 
this is injected under the skin of a white mouse or a guinea-pig. 

A portion of the pus should be stained direct, then examined for 
tetanus bacilli and for the terminal spores (drum-sticks). (From Now.)

whence it received the name of "the nail-head germ." The spore 
is much greater in diameter than the width of the bacillus and gives 
it the appearance of a pin or a clove or an eyescrew. Spores may 
be seen in the long threads at times. 

The spores remain alive and virulent in culture media for more 
than a year (in a dark place), but are not able to live through a boil- 
ing temperature of 212 degrees F.^ applied for ten minutes. Five 
per cent, phenol solution kills them in one day, but if muriatic acid 
is added the spores perish within a couple of hours. The vitality 
may be tested by transplanting after exposures to heat and antisep- 
tics. Bichloride of mercury i-iooo destroys them within three 
hours, but when muriatic acid is added to the mercury they perish in 
less than an hour. 

The young bacilli may be stained for flagella and the number is 
surprisingly large and it is difficult to count them. Votteler claims 
to have counted 50 to 100 growing out from the entire surface. 
The bacilli are not actively, motile which is more surprising from 
the fact that other germs with one-fifth the number of flagella are 
very active. There is, however, a distinct spontaneous motion 
which may be seen in the hanging drop cultures. 

Tetanus bacillus is strongly anaerobic, even small quantities of 
oxygen interfere with its growth, especially if it is cultivated from 
the animal body or wounds which have become infected. After 
transplanting a number of times in nutrient media the tetanus germs 
become less susceptible to oxygen and have been cultivated quite suc- 
cessfully in the presence of other organisms belonging to the class of 
aerobes. When grown as an aerobe, pure cultures lose much of 
their virulence. This is also true of other anaerobic bacteria be- 
longing to the pathogenic classification. 

Bacillus tetanus grows well at 98 to 100 degrees F. and slowly 
at room temperature. At 50 degrees F. there is no growth. When 
the germs are very virulent there is only a moderate growth, even 
at 98 degrees F., but cultures that have been frequently transplanted 
grow most luxuriantly. Many pathogenic bacteria seem to change 
in their nature and develop the characteristics of the putrefactive 
species and lose much of their virulence after repeated transplanting. 
These germs when inoculated into susceptible animals become high- 
ly virulent again. 

The cultivation of tetanus in artificial media is made reo^ular 
anaerobic culture apparatus by using hydrogen as an atmosphere af- 
ter driving out all oxygen, but the least expensive method is the ab- 
sorption of oxygen by pyrogalic acid in the presence of potassium 
hydroxid, enough to make the acid alkaline, when it will darken, 
first brown and then black. 



200 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

Animals which have tetanus will have the active poison 
throughout the circulating system. The blood and gland secretions 
contain it in sufficient quantities to set up the disease in other ani- 
mals which are inoculated with the blood or pleural exudes. Strange 
to say, the tissue of diseased animals seems to have to be devoid of 
the poison, except at the point where the germs had gained entrance 
i e., the wound or seat of inoculation. The poison becomes inert if 
subjected to temperatures varying from 150 to 212 F., but if it is 
dried at ordinary temperature first it retains its virulence and with- 
stands much higher temperatures. 

When the germs gain entrance into a living animal or man 
through a w^ound the point of entrance will heal o\'er and appearjo 
be getting well. This places the tetanus bacilli in an anaerobic and 
they soon begin to multiply, the period of incubation being from 
one to twenty-five days. If lockjaw results after one day there are 
probably a number of pus germs in the wound, which use up the 
oxygen from the surface and place the tetanus bacilli in their favor- 
able anaerobic condition, in which case the sufferer has small chance 
of recovery. The longer the period of incubation the greater is the 
chance for recoverv, because the svstem becomes more or less armed 
against the poison by gradually accommodating itself to its influence. 

The anti-tetanic serum is prepared from the blood of inoculated 
animals and has been injected into the blood of victims of tetanus 
WMth satisfactory results. The serum is known to produce im- 
munity, and hundreds of positive cures are recorded from its use. 

There is no doubt but that the flesh of animals suffering with 
lockjaw contains large quantities of the toxin in the juices, and if 
used as food either in manufacture of canned meats or soup stock, 
\Titl cause severe sickness and possibly death. It is certainW a 
dangerous malady, from the fact that an animal mav have the di- 
sease during the period of incubation and show no outward sign of 
its presence. There is always an exceedingly abundant production 
of HoS (sulphuretted hydrogen) where the germs are grow- 
ing and indol is produced, so that infected food products will show 
signs of contamination if care is exercised in inspection. 

BACITXUS DIPHTIIERIAE COLUMBARUM. 

This is a non-motile organism, about 2/ia in length and o.5i* 
broad, having rounded ends. There is no spore formation. -and it 
is aerobic and does not liquefy gelatin. The flesli of chickens suf- 
fering with this disease presents a flabby appearance and is. usually 
somewhat discolored. Chickens, game birds and pigeons are sus- 
ceptile, and it is very contagious among them. 

There are numerous cases of ptomaine poisoning on record due 
to bacteria which have produced the poison in chicken ; indeed, this 



DECOMPOSITION CAUSED BY MICRO-ORGANISMS. 201 

is quite common. One case happened three years ago in Aspin- 
wall, Pa., at a chicken and waffle supper. Fully twenty persons 
were made violently ill from eating the chicken. One case of 
poisoning from chicken soup came under my notice during a visit to 
San Francisco. In this case the soup had been canned and was 
perfectly sterilized, yet the ptomaine remained. Just what organ- 
ism caused the trouble I do not know, because I was not in a position 
to make a thorough examination, but part of the soup when fed to a 
dog caused the animal to become violently sick. There is no doubt 
but that Bacillus Diptheriae Columbarum is one organism which 
produces a powerful toxic poison and that chickens sufifering with 
dfptheria have the poison in sufficient quantities to produce severe 
cramps and nervous prostration with symptoms of paralysis in per- 
sons who partake of the cooked flesh. There is no doubt that such 
diseased poultry is sometimes sold on the market, and packers of 
potted chicken, chicken soup and canned chicken should be extreme- 
ly careful in selection. If careful inspection is made, evidence of 
disease will almost invariably be indicated by general appearance 
and color. 

Bacillus Diptheria Vitulorum is another organism affecting 
calves and is found in the mouth, lungs and intestines. It is usual- 
ly in filaments, and is several times as long as it measures in breadth. 
It is non-liquefying on calf blood serum, which seems to be the only 
medium on which a culture can be obtained. 

The flesh of a calf suffering from diptheria is not sound in 
color, nor is it firm, and the usual precautions will suffice to aid the 
inspector in judging it. 

There are a number of diseases affecting animals and poultry 
which are due to pathogenic bacteria, but I will merely mention a 
few of them, as our readers are pretty familiar with the subject by 
this time. Vibrio Metschnikovii. whicli is the organism producing 
one kind of chicken cholera. Bacillus of Chicken Cholera, Hog 
Cholera Bacillus, Anthrax Bacillus, and various organisms which 
produce blood poisoning. 

It must not be supposed by our readers that meats and albumi- 
nous food materials, which contain poisons due to the organisms we 
have been describing, are constantly put on the market and sold to 
unsuspecting packers. It happens only rarely that such material is 
used, and our object has been to furnish complete information on 
this subject to teach packers the necessity of careful inspection, both 
macroscopically and microscopically. Ptomaine ])oisonig from 
canned goods is extremely rare in comparison with such complica- 
tions from other sources, but we hope to decrease these by fully de- 
scribing the various organisms known to produce poisons and by 
pointing out the danger in using unsound material. 



202 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

Every packer should take a lively interest in this subject, be- 
cause cases of Ptomaine poisoning, although rare, are a source of 
considerable annoyance to the whole industry. Unreasonable bills 
are introduced in the legislatures of various states which cause the 
packers trouble. I have referred in former pages to the "Canned 
Goods Dating Bills." 

PTOMAINES AND TOXINS. 

Ptomaine Poisoning and Its Bearing on the Food Industry. 

The word ptomaine springs from the Greek word (ptoma) 
ptoma, which is pronounced (toma) and means a dead body. This 
name was given to a group of poisons obtained from cadavers by 
Selmi, a noted Italian chemist and toxicoligist. For many years 
the term was applied to all bases which combined with acids and 
formed salts as a result of bacterial activity, and these bases were 
regarded as poisons, but later investigations have demonstrated that 
ptomaines are not all poisons, in fact only a few of them may be 
considered as dangerous. Many of the ptomaines owe their poison- 
ous properties to a more powerful poison, which is termed a toxin, 
and this is a product of the putrefactive and pathogenic bacteria, 
many of which we have described. Novy describes a ptomaine as. 
"an organic chemical compound, basic in character, and formed by 
the action of bacteria on nitrogenous matter. On account of their 
basic properties, in which they resemble the vegetable alkaloids, 
ptomaines may be called putrefactive alkaloids." 

They are formed in the putrefactive processes on both vege- 
table and animal matter of albuminous nature by the agency of bac- 
teria. When such matter is attacked by bacteria, the various mole- 
cules containing carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen, are upset 
and new atomical relations are formed by the cleavage, in the vari- 
ous steps of total dissolution. The final results of bacterial activity 
is the fomation of carbon dioxid, ammonia, and water, and it is be- 
tween the first and last stages that the alkaloids are formed. 

In some cases of food poisonings, toxins have been isolated as 
well as ptomaines, so we will include both in the discussion of this 
subject. 

The increase of food poisoning in recent years has been de- 
clared by some eminent authorities to the increased consumption of 
preserved foods, the claim being made that inferior stuff, which 
would not be purchased in the raw state on account of its appearance 
and partial decomposition is easily made to look well by skillful 
chefs and manufacturers of canned foods, and that these contain the 
poisons elaborated by harmful bacteria, and that these poisonous 
alkaloids do not lose their potency in the cooking and sterilizing 



DEXIJOMPOSITION CAUSED BY MICRO-ORGANISMS. 203 

processes. Canners have been accused of using partially decom- 
posed^ materials, both knowingly and ignorantly, and the responsi- 
bility for a large number of food poisoning cases, has been charged 
against them. For the most part ignorance has been charged be- 
cause they are not familiar with the scientific principles of their busi- 
ness, and do not realize the dangers lurking in decomposing ma- 
terial, due to vital activity of bacteria. 

While there may be extremely little truth in these statements 
and while we must admit that the canners and preservers of food 
products have been guilty of gross ignorance, and are not even today 
well informed on these matters, we cannot help making the state- 
ment that the charges are very much overdrawn and that the ignor- 
ance displayed by the canners could hardly surpass that displayed by 
the list of physicians, who are for the most part to blame for the 
charges of ptomaine poisoning against canned goods. In order to 
write intelligently on this subject, I have made it a point to question 
a number of physicians concerning ptomaines and toxic poisons, and 
their answers showed that they were as a rule ignorant of their 
names and origin. 

I do not mean to cast reflections upon physicians in general; 
many of them are conscientious in their diagnoses and would not 
place the blame on canned goods without investigating the cause 
carefully. There are others, however, who jump at conclusions and 
furnish the press with information which may be absolutely untrue. 
In this manner false statements have been circulated throughout the 
civilized world and the preserving industry has had to bear the 
brunt in many cases. 

It is not true that canners and preservers are in the habit of 
using partially decomposed material. It is impossible to make fine 
goods from anything but the very best raw material, and all reput- 
able firms are extremely careful in selecting the very best, and their 
contracts with farmers are strict. 

We must admit, however, that there are some packers who are 
ignorant of the dangers of which we are writing and there may be 
some who are unscrupulous, but the goods turned out by these 
manufacturers are very inferior, often highly colored to cover up 
imperfections, and the quality is very poor. There have been, and 
probably are today, a few packers who come under these two classes. 
A good Natural Pure Food Law will be a great blessing to the 
whole industry, and will eliminate all goods artificially colored, and 
unnecessarily preserved with antiseptics. When this law is made 
effective, the honest and well informed food preservers will enjoy 
a ready market for all their goods, and will not be embarrassed by 
persecutions. 



204 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

When all, or nearly all, goods of inferior ([uality are elimin- 
ated, there will be renewed confidence in manufactured food pro- 
ducts, and the worry of putting up goods at home will form a part 
of past history. The superiority of manufactured food products 
over home made goods is conceded hy the intelligent consumers, for 
the reason that only men of great skill are employed to produce 
goods of fine quality, and by the use of improved machinery the 
little imperfections seen in the home goods are overcome. 

The progress now being made in the science of bacteriolog>*. 
and the research work in physiological chemistry, are furnishing 
considerable literary material, which is being i)ublished to en- 
lighten manufacturers on these subjects. The problems of spoilage 
are now taken up carefully, and the various ptomaines and toxins 
are becoming known, also the bacteria which are responsible. 

The isolation of ptomaines and toxins rec[uires great skill and 
patience, and there are only a very few men who are far enough 
advanced to make these analvses, and our readers will be able to 
judge of this from the examples we will give as illustrations. 

We will not attempt in a w^ork of this kind to give a complete 
list of all these poisons (and methods of extracting them), but if 
anyone desires to enter into the study in a comprehensive manner 
we will be glad to furnish material for such research. Manufac- 
turers who ha\e suits brought against them on account of reported 
ptomaine poison found in their goods need some direct information 
on the methods employed by chemists in isolating these poisons, in 
order to supply their lawyers with the necessary questions to be 
asked the physicians who testify in such cases. The methods de- 
scribed here will show how complicated the analyses are and it is 
safe to say that they will be sufficiently advanced to enable a good 
attorney to overthrow mere guesswork of many physicians who 
testify in these cases. Xot long ago a certain well-known firm was 
called upon to make defense in suit for damages ; the parties claim- 
ing ptomaine poisoning where canned gootls were used at a meal, 
after which one member of the family was taken violently ill. 
Three doctors were called in, and worked all night to save the wo- 
man, and succeeded, but the family l)eing poor, and the doctor's bills 
large, a suit for damages seemed to be a good way to even up. When 
the case came up, and the attorney, (armed with the chemical meth- 
ods for extracting ptomaines) asked the doctors the various ques- 
tions, the case seemed ridiculous and was thrown out of court. In 
July, 190.3, when the writer was in St. Paul attending the Conven- 
tion of State Food Commissioners and Chemists, an article ap- 
peared in the papers stating that a family had been poisoned with 
food containing a ptomaine, and the physician who attended the pa- 
tients was quoted as authority for the statement. Samples of the 



DECOMPOSITION CAUSED BY MICRO-ORGANISMS. 205 

food and some of stomach contents were sent to the bacteriologist 
of St. Paul and the analysis proved it to be a common mineral 
poison and not a ptomaine. The cooked beefsteak was found to 
contain this poison. Hbw the poison happened to be there no one 
was able to learn, but the point I wish to make is that ptomaine 
poisons are not always responsible. 

These cases demonstrate the hasty conclusions often reached 
by doctors. To be sure they furnish sensational reading, but the 
manufacturer of foodstuffs is put to considerable worry and ex- 
pense to defend himself when suits are entered against him for 
damages. 

In making examinations of suspected food, the samples should 
be brought to the laboratory without delay to lessen the change of 
other germs gaining entrance. The germs present on the inside 
of the material are probably the cause, and cultures are prepared 
according to the well-known plate methods. Some of the plates 
are incubated in the anaerobic, and others in the ordinary way, so 
that all the bacteria present may come under the eye of the analyst. 
There is hardly ever enough of the suspected food to make a chemi- 
cal test for a ptomaine or toxin, because it is impossible to extract 
the minute quantities of these powerful poisons except from large 
quantities of material. If any appreciable amount of poison of 
bacterial origin could be isolated from a small quantity of material, 
it would be so powerful as to kill in a short time all the affected 
persons. One gram of tetanotoxin is calculated to be sufficient to 
kill 4,500 people. 

After the germs have been isolated, those of poisonous char-' 
acter are easily identified, and each species is then tested on such 
animals as mice, rats, kittens, puppies, rabbits and guinea-pigs by 
feeding, by subcutaneous, inoculation, by ultra-peritt)neal inocula- 
tion and by intravenous inoculation. Various animals are so 
treated, because some may not be susceptible. The inoculating fluid 
is generally a bouillon culture of the germs, twenty-four hours old, 
and the amount used is from one to ten cubic centimeters. Some- 
times the inoculation is made with the filtrate of a bouillon culture, 
from which all living germs are held back by filtering through por- 
celain. After making these tests the analysis for the ptomaines 
and toxins are conducted as follows : 

Only absolutely pure chemicals can successfully be employed 
in this work and this must be ascertained beforehand by evaporat- 
ing the ether used and analyzing the residue for poisonous bodies. 

The Stas-Otto Method. (Vaughan and Xovy.). 

This method depends upon the following facts : ( i ) The salts 
of the alkaloids are soluble in water and alcohol and generally in- 
soluble in ether, and (2) the free alkaloids are soluble in ether and 



206 CANNING AND PRESERVING OP FOOD PRODUCTS. 

are removed from alkaline fluids by agitation with ether. These 
principles are capable of great variations in their application. The 
usual directions are as follows : Treat the mass under examination 
with about twice its weight of 90 per cent alcohol, and from ten 
to thirty grains. of tartaric or oxalic acid; digest the whole for some 
time at about I58°F. and filter. Evaporate the filtrate at a tem- 
perature not exceeding 95^ F., either in a strong current of air or 
in vacuo over sulphuric acid. Take up the residue with absolute 
alcohol, filter, and again evaporate at a low temperature. Dissolve 
this residue in water, render alkaline with sodium carbonate, and 
agitate with ether. After separation remove ether with a pipette, or 
by means of a separator, and allow it to evaporate spontaneously. 
The residue may be further purified by redissolving in water and 
again extracting with ether. Chloroform, amylic alcohol and ben- 
zene are used as solvents after extraction with ether. 

Brieger's Method. — The substance under examination is di- 
vided as fine as possible, and then heated with water slightly acidi- 
fied with hydrochloric acid. During the heating care must be taken 
that the feebly acid reaction is maintained and the heat should con- 
tinue for only a few minutes. The liquid is then filtered and con- 
centrated, at first on a plate, and then on the water-bath, to a synip. 
An extraction of the syrup is made with 96 per cent, alcohol and 
the filtered extract is treated with a warm alcoholic solution of lead 
acetate. The lead precipitate is removed by filtration, the filtrate 
evaporated to a syrup and again extracted with 96 per cent alcohol. 
The alcohol is driven off; the residue taken up with water; traces 
of lead removed with hydrogen sulphid; and the filtrate acidified 
with hydrochloric acid, evaporated to a syrup, which is extracted 
with alcohol, and the filtrate precipitated with an alcoholic solution 
of mercuric chlorid. The mercury precipitate is boiled with water, 
and on account of the differences in solubilitv of the double com- 
pounds with mercury, one ptomaine may be separated from others 
at this stage of the process. 

The mercury filtrate is freed from mercury, evaporated, and 
the excess of hydrochloric acid carefully neutralized with soda (the 
reaction is kept feebly acid) ; then it is again taken up with alcohol 
to free it from inorganic salts. The alcohol is evaporated, the resi- 
due taken up with water, the remaining traces of hydrochloric acid 
neutralized with soda, the whole acidified with nitric acid and treated 
with phosphomolybdic acid. The phosphomolybdate double com- 
pound is separated by filtration and decomposed with neutral ace- 
tate of lead. This is hastened by heating on the water bath. The 
lead is removed by hydrogen sulphid, the filtrate is evaporated to a 
syrup and taken up with alcohol from which many ptomaines are 
deposited as chlorids, or double salts may be formed in the alcoholic 
solution. 



DECOMPOSITION CAUSEaD BY MICRO-ORGANISMS. 207 

The chlorids deposited from the alcoholic solution are seldom 
pure and may be isolated by precipitation with gold chlorid, plat- 
inum chlorid, or picric acid, and on account of the differences in 
solubility of these salts, the purification is rendered more easy. 
The chlorid of the base is obtained by removing the metal with 
hydrogen sulphid, while the picrate is taken up with water, acidified 
with hydrochloric acid, and repeatedly extracted with ether, in order 
to remove the picric acid. 

These remarkable methods are not the onlv ones used in ex- 
tracting bacterial poisons, but they are sufficiently complicated to 
test the skill of even first-class chemists and mav be used as a means 
of defense against falsely reported discoveries of ptomaines in food 
products. 

We will conclude this subject by naming some of the poisonous 
ptomaines which have been isolated by some of the most eminent 
chemists in the world. (Tetanotoxin CgHuN) — (Amylanim C5 
HisN)— Hexylamin CeHi5N)— Trimethylenediamin CgHgNa)— 
(Susotoxin CioHacNo). — (Methyl guanidin C2H7N3) — (Asellin

STERILIZATION. 

Its Application in Canning and Preserving 

To sterilize any material is to make it barren, or to destroy the 
bacteria present, or render them incapable of reproduction. In 
its broad meaning, it might embrace the use of any chemical or phys- 
ical force, capable of destroying reproductive powers, but in its re- 
' stricted sense it means to apply heat to destroy micro-organisms 
or to hinder their vegetating power. 

The large number of bacteria which do not produce spores 
are easily destroyed at temperatures ranging from 140 to 180 de- 
grees F., moist heat, and to this class belong nearly all pathogenic, 
lactic and acetic bacteria, and also yeast and molds, although these 
are more resistant to heat than the bacteria mentioned. To the 
other class which produce six:)res belong the butyric, subtilis and 
mesenteric families, and a few to the Pathogenic. There are a 
great number of species belonging to these families, some of which 
produce spores of great vitality, and these spores are able to resist 
boiling for hours, owing to a thick membrane which protects the vi- 
tal power within. They resemble dry beans, peas, com, etc, and 
the older they are, the closer do their heat-resisting membranes 
enclose their life. I have seen l>eans so hard after several vears 
drying, that they refused to absorb water for two weeks and then 
very slowly, so when six>res become old it is reasonable to suppose 
that they shrink, and the pores of their membranes become im- 
pervious to moisture, so that they require very high temperature 
to deprive them of vitality. So small do these six>res become, that 
even the microscoi:)e fails often to reveal their presence in fluids, 
and one writer has conceived the idea that they might not become 
wet, if air containing them should be forced through sulphuric acid. 
This might seem ridiculous on first thought, but when we consider 
their minuteness and the repellant force of certain substances 
against moisture, it does not seem so unreasonable. If we fill a 



STERILIZATION. 209 

glass graduate with water, so that the surface is not disturbed, 
there will be a distinct difference between the height of the water 
at the center from that at the edge of the glass ; the glass holds the 
rising fluid down below the service level, unless it be first moist- 
ened. A thin cover-glass will float on a fluid, although its specific 
gravity is much greater; the repellant force will bank up the fluid 
all around it, so that it will float below the surrounding surface of 
the fluid, which has no power to wet the upper surface of the glass. 
The same phenomenon may be observed if a small needle be gently 
laid on the surface of the fluid. To mv mind it seems reasonable 
to suppose that some spores are so constructed that they will repel 
the surrounding fluid and do not become wet until certain changes 
are produced in that fluid, either by increased temperature or 
nutritive power, or by chemicals which may attack the cell mem- 
brane. 

For general sterilizing purposes, the packers of hermetically' 
sealed goods use moist heat. This kind of heat is far better than- 
dry heat, because of the character of the cell membrane of bacteria . 
and spores. It is by the absorption of moisture that bacteria are 
able to grow and vegetate, and their spores are enabled to send 
forth young rods. Steam heat therefore exerts a violent action 
against life and destroys it much quicker than the same tempera- 
ture of dry heat. The action of the cell membrane against dry heat 
might be likened to that of asbestos. For sterilizing canned goods, ' 
the packers use several devices which are all good, but the thermal 
death point of the bacteria present in the cans is a problem. 

There are a number of bacteria closely resembling one another, 
which produce spores greatly varying in heat-resisting power; the 
most resistant species known was discovered by Globig, w'hich is 
found on potatoes, and is called the ''Potato bacillus." This or- 
ganism produces spores able to live through six to ten hours 
or more of boiling temperature. Almost all the bacteria having 
great heat-resisting power are found in cultivated soil, and are 
present on the stems, leaves and edible portions of all vegetables. 
If the juices of these plants become infested with spores of these 
various species, the problem of sterilization is a deep one ; too much 
heat destroys the flavor of the canned product, and as a rule cannot 
be fixed broad enough to take in the thermal death point of all heat- 
resisting germs, since nearly all speices are able to grow on most 
of the vegetables used for canning, excepting tomatoes ; for instance, 
the juice of peas rrfay be used to cultivate in pure culture the "Potato 
bacillus/' and we all know that a process sufficientlv high to destroy 
the spores of this rfiicrobe w'ould cook the peas to pieces and destroy 
the flavor. When decomposition of vegetables sets in, especially while 
yet in.the field, or when they are piled up with the pods, leaves or 



210 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

vines still present among them, the way is made easy for the devel- 
opment of numerous spore-l^earing bacteria, which find a suitable 
nutritive material in the exposed juices, to multiply and produce 
spores. When cultures are made of the bacteria found on the stems, 
leaves, pods or husks, the varieties of spore-bearing bacteria found 
are numerous. As we have stated before, the most hardy bacteria 
are found in the soil, and they are growing rapidly on all dead 
matter which nature carries down to them ; their spores are formed 
and under the warm summer sunshine they become dry and light, 
and are carried by currents of air to all parts of the field, findinglodg- 
ment on the growing plants, they lie dormant until they gain entrance 
to nutrient juices, when they begin a new life cycle and form the 
same hardy spores which are often found in cans of spoiled goods. 
Now, to make the point clear, if packers use raw material which 
is bruised or partially decomposed, they have much to contend with, 
because they must process this material long enough to destroy all 
manner of bacteria, which gain entrance to the deep portions. 

The value of a blanching bath for peas, string beans, asparagus, 
etc., is twofold; it arrests decomposition and it washes away many 
resistant forms of germs, but if the deepest tissues and fibres are 
penetrated, the washing does not carry away the destroying agents. 
j There are some points worthy of consideration here, and we 

I refer to the nature of certain vegetables, and their nutritive value 

I for various bacteria. Every kind of fruit and vegetable Jias a chem- 

ical composition peculiar to itself; some are strongly acid, while 
others are nearly neutral, some have considerable starch and al- 
' bumen, while others are rich in sugar or carbohydrates ; some have 

antiseptic compounds, such as benzoic acid, phenol, salicylic acid, 
creosote, formaldehvde, etc., but the amount is onlv small, vet sutfi- 
cient to prevent the growth of many species of bacteria. There 
are certain species of bacteria which are always found associated 
with a given kind of vegetable or fruit, w-hich furnish the germs 
with all their vital requirement ; other species may be present, but 
are checked in their growth by the greater multiplication of the reg- 
I ular species. Certain bacteria peculiar to peas may be able to force 

entrance to the juices, while others would find nutrition only on ex- 
posed surfaces. This accounts for prevalence of certain species 
on a particular kind of vegetable. 

The processor becomes familiar with a certain temperature, 
prolonged for a given time, which seems to sterilize the same veg- 
etables, fruits, etc., year after year, without very much spoilage, 
but suddenly the old rule fails and whole batches of canned goods 
spoil because of a new species of bacteria having taken the field; 
the old process is not sufficient to destroy the spores of the new 
variety. How necessary it is to know the reason for this! Only 
a knowledge of bacteria can help him.

STERILIZATION. 213 

There are some natural causes for the presence of new vari- 
eties of bacteria which suddenly make their appearance in canned 
goods. The weather often has an influence on the chemical com- 
position o7 raw material; during some seasons there may be more 
sugar and less starch, or there may be less sugar and increased 
acidity, due to rains or drought. We have all noticed that it is 
sometimes the very finest looking corn which spoils. We have seen 
tomatoes crack open by sunshine after rains, and later have heard 
the popping of the corks from the catsup bottles, or seen the cans 
swell in various piles. 

The nature of the soil may ha re an influence. The farmers 
have been growing for us the same products year after year in 
ground cared for and manured regularly ; suddenly it becomes nec- 
essary to procure a certain fertilizer and a number go in together 
and buy fertilizer which changes the chemical composition of the 
truck raised on the ground. 

Now when changes take place in the chemical composition of 
raw material, it may not be just suited to the same varieties of bac- 
teria formerly found associated with it, but the changed constit- 
uents form the nutritive elements necessary for the luxuriant growth 
of more formidable species. 

The problem of sterilization becomes a scientific study, when 
such changes as we have mentioned take place in the composition 
of the raw material. To be sure, anyone may be able to sterilize 
any kind of product by giving it a high temperature for a long time, 
more than is actually necessary; but to know just how much is suffi- 
cient, and to be sure that the goods will keep well, is where good 
judgment is required. If the packers would supply themselves 
with a good microscope, with one-twelfth oil immersion ob- 
jective and an incubator, it would be a very easy matter to 
know positively if a given process was sufficient. A can or 
a number of cans from each day's work could be placed in the incu- 
bator, and if the sterilization was riot complete the bacteria would 
develop at a blood temperature within twenty-four to forty-eight 
hours; juice from these cans could be made into a hanging drop, 
and if any bacteria happen to be present, the microscope would re- 
veal them. Most of the sixjre-bearing bacteria are motile, and 
there w-ould be some present, even in small quantities of the juice, 
long before the formation of sufficient gas to swell the cans. A 
number of tests could be made with juice of these cans, and the 
packer could keep close watch on the sterilizing process, and in 
many cases could reduce the time, which would insure a better 
flavor. 

The exhaust process, or the filling of cans with hot material, 
prior to the final process, is a good plan for two reasons : The hot 



214 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

material is expanded by the heat, which produces a vacuum after 
the cans are steriHzed ; the heat thus given the material will shorten 
the final process. The temperature given in the final process varies 
according to the material and size of the cans. A thermal death 
point for the bacteria present is first determined, then, to this must 
be added the time rec^uired for that heat to reach thfe center of the 
cans; for this purpose the manufacturers of thermometers have 
made a device, with a self-registering thermometer to indicate the 
temperature at the center of the can; by repeated experiments the 
time required for penetration may be known. The mercury tube 
has a constriction which prevents the return of the metal to the 
bulb, and when it is removed will show the exact maximum heat 
at the center of the can. These- little devices are inexpensive and 
should be used by every packer. 

We have referred to the vacuum produced by the exhaust pro- 
cess, or filling of cans with hot material prior to the final or steril- 
izing process; the vacuum is convenient for drawing the tin back 
to normal shape after it has been swelled at both ends in the ster- 
ilization. There was a strong belief among packers that a vac- 
uum was absolutely necessary for preserving canned goods, and 
there still exists a beHef of this kind, not only among some packers, 
but machinery men as well. The vacuum has no value as a means 
of preventing decomposition by bacteria. Even if a very power- 
ful vacuum could be produced, it would not prevent the hardy spore- 
bearing bacteria from developing in cans under-processed. Even 
if the oxygen remaining in the partial vacuum could be replaced by 
hydrogen or carbonic acid gas, these bacteria would still be able to 
grow and multiply. Nearly all of the species identified with spoil- 
age of canned goods grow well in the presence or absence of oxy- 
gen, and though aerobes, generally are also facultative anaerobes. 

The temperature and time required for sterilizatioa depends 
upon the nature of the bacteria present, and the character of the 
material. Different fruits and vegetables vary in their chemical 
composition. There are also marked differences in the same vege- 
tables and fruits grown in dift'erent parts of the world. Tomatoes 
growni in the Northern States, Michigan, \\'isconsin and Minne- 
sota, have less acid and more sugar than those grown in Iowa, In- 
diana, New Tersev, and Delaware. The different varieties of fruits 
and vegetables vary in their composition, so that the conditions are 
different in one locality from those in another. Even in the same 
locality two kinds of peas or corn, etc.. may require different steril- 
izing processes, owing to the presence on one of a particularly 
hardy spore bearing baccillus, which may not l>e growing on the 
other variety. 



STERILIZATION. 215 

V 

It is not possible, therefore, to make a bacteriological investiga- 
tion of spoilage in one locality and make the conclusions fit the 
conditions in all cases. One or two bacteriologists have made care- 
ful studv of sour corn, and isolated a number of bacteria found in 
the cans, but these bacteria are not always in sour com; some of 
them may be feund, and even other species entirely different in an- 
other location. The same thing applies to peas, beans, asparagus, 
tomatoes and all kinds of fruits, but these fruits do not varv so 
much in all their germ flora as do vegetables. 

The difference of time and temperature required for sterilizing 
different kinds of vegetables has been a perplexing problem for 
canners. It is not generally understcx)d why peas should keep 
at a temperature l^elow that of corn fully twenty minutes less in 
time, or why peaches should keep when processed several minutes 
less than tomatoes. 

The difference is due to two facts — there are different species 
of micro-organisms and there are chemical differences in composi- 
tion which render the juice of one antiseptic to germs found in the 
juice of another. As a rule bacteria do not grow in juices which 
liave a marked acid reaction, although there are notable exceptions 
fo this, but generally speaking the more acid the juice contains, the 
fewer the s|>ecies of bacteria. The hardy spore bearing bacteria, 
as a rule, do not thrive well- on acid media, even small quantities 
being detrimental to their growth. The slight addition of sugar 
however, overcomes the antiseptic properties of some juices, and 
the spore-bearing bacilli are al)le to grow to some extent. The 
writer has often been surprised on opening cans of under processed 
goods, which were bulged at both ends from the enormous pressure 
of gases within, to find how few bacteria the juices actually con- 
tained. The spores had developed and some reproduction had re- 
sulted, until the amount of acid formed had acted as an antiseptic, 
and multiplication had apparently ceased. 

It often happens that the can springs a leak from the pressure, 
and the gas is liberated, then the bacteria from the air gain entrance 
and the acids are attacked and reduced to fattv or volatile acids, the 
original agents having gone into a resting state, or formed spores. 

The climatic conditions of certain localities have something to 
do with the varieties of bacteria found associated with spoilage. In 
some of the Central and Southern States there are much hardier 
varieties prevalent than in Northern States, or the Xew England 
States, consequently a process that is giving satisfaction in ]\Iaine 
may not be sufficient for sterilizing the same product in Ohio. 

Cleanliness J and proper disposition of zixisfe material, are prom- 
inent factors in sterilization. There are times during the canning 
season when the raw products, or material only partially cooked. 



216 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

are exposed to the ravages of bacteria floating on dust, and matter 
held in suspension by the atmosphere. This is the case when break- 
downs occur in the machinery, or when the work is not carried on 
systematically, or when the receipts of raw material are greater than 
the canning capacity. The danger is greatest where partially 
cooked material is exposed to the air. The spore bearing bacteria 
and the putritive anaerobes are liable to set up nnperceived decompo- 
sition, and elaborate foul substances such as indol and skatol, or 
may produce bitterness or disagreeable acidity. The partially 
cooked material offers a more suitable nutrition for these true sca- 
vengers, because che cellulose or fibre is softened and the juices are 
richer in albuminous compounds, which furnish them with all their 
vital requirements. The danger from these bacteria is not so great 
where absolute cleanliness is exercised and proper disposition is 
made of waste material. If the waste material such as cobs, hulls, 
husks, vines, stems, peelings, seeds and trimmings, are dumped in 
heaps in the vicinity, the air will be found teeming with the spores 
of these micro-organisms, ever ready to fall into nutrient material, 
and there begin their work assigned by nature, the tearing down 
process of fermentation or putrefaction. If accumulations are al- 
lowed to stand from one year to another, the spores of these bac- 
teria may become so dry and hard that the old and tried sterilizing 
process will fail to be effective. There is great truth in these state- 
ments, viz., that age will toughen the spore membrane and that the 
spore protoplasm will dry and shrink and be more impervious to the 
action of heat, and require longer time to absorb moisture so nec- 
essary for rapid sterilization. Thus the ordinary sterilizing pro- 
cess becomes ineffective. The same danjjer may lurk in the dirt and 
dust of the factory; if the floors and machines are not kept clean, 
by the liberal use of soap, hot water and steam, the harmful bacteria 
will be present in all parts of the building, in such numbers as to 
produce chemical changes where least suspected. The evil of un- 
cleanliness is not confined to the breeding of bacteria alone, but flies, 
insects, rats, mice, etc., are drawn by the opportunities of getting 
food, and the whole factory will soon be in a very bad condition. 

How is it possible to produce fine gooils where the entire es- 
tablishment gives the impression of careless, neglectful methods! 
Uncleari methods breed carelessness in employees, and this becomes 
evident in the character and quality of the goods turned out. The 
sterilization is accomplished only at a time and temperature beyond 
that actually required in a clean, well-regulated factor}', and the 
product has lost the color and flavor which we might suppose once 
existed. 

When Isaac AVinslow began to pack corn in tin cans, he used 
only an open bath process at first. . He boiled the cans for several 



STERILIZATION. 217 

hours and succeeded, strange to say, in keeping a large per cent, of 
his goods. Our readers are familiar with the history of his after 
failures, and his final adoption of the steam retort. That he was 
ever able to sterilize corn by simply boiling the cans has been a 
source of wonder to the writer; certainly none of the well-known 
heat resisting bacteria were present, or if so they had not become ac- 
customed to corn. This theory seems to have some foundation, be- 
cause bacteria are known to accommodate themselves to certain ma- 
terial when forced to grow in it; for instance, the Bacillus Diph- 
theria grows very scantily upon ordinary agar, when planted fresh 
from the false membrane of a diphtheria patient, yet after trans- 
planting upon the same medium a number of times, it grows quite 
well and if kept in a cool place, loses its virulence to a certain extent. 
The Typhoid Bacillus becomes less virulent after repeated trans- 
planting, and the same characteristic has been demonstrated in 
various species. So it may be when corn was first grown in this 
country that the hardy spore bearing bacteria did not at first find 
suitable nourishment, except in some cases. Now it is fair to pre- 
sume that when once started the bacilli became accustomed to corn, 
and their nature having changed through that nourishment their 
spores more easily attacked the corn in following years. The open 
bath process suddenly failed and Winslow and his contemporaries 
lost almost their entire pack. 

It is w^ell rememtered that corn was sterilized a few vears 
ago by a certain process which is not now effective in all cases, so we 
cannot but hold to the theory that the most hardy species of bacteria 
are gradually becoming accustomed to corn, and perhaps other vege- 
tables. No one can say that new species are being created, but 
such may be the case; if so, then we may be able to explain the 
necessitated increase of temperature for sterilization. There are, 
however (found on vegetables), so many species closely resembling 
each other, diflfering only in one or two characteristics, that we are 
strengthened in our first theory, and we may ascribe those differ- 
ences to the changes in the materials upon wh'.ch they have habit- 
uated themselves. 

By increased temperature in the sterilizing process, certainly 
the color and flavor suffered to some extent, the color particularly, 
and the demand made by the trade for nearly natural colors in 
canned goods, forced evil practices upon the packers, corn was 
bleached and peas were colored with copper, and tomatoes received 
the "sunshine'' from aniline dves. In some cases the sterilization 
was reduced, and antiseptics added. This helped to preserve the 
color, but the quality suffered even more than by increased tempera- 
ture. In the course of time these methods passed the limit, and 
some of the goods put upon the market were unsightly, and the 



218 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

flavor was compJeteh' lost. Tomatoes and catsup were colored 
Vieautiful carmines, and looked more like red paints than articles of 
food. 

By the excessive use of chemicals and colors to shorten the 
sterilization, the public tnmed away from canned goods of this na- 
ture, and it is well remembered how the prices dropped to almost 
nothing (several years ago"). The people were getting- libera!

factured food product brought to the table, so they clamored for 
pure food laws, elected State Food Commissioners, aided by skilled 
chemists, and the tide has turned tiie other way. There is no 
doubt that these abuses will have settled the lawful right to use cer- 
tain colors and preservatives, there may be some condiments ex- 
cepted, but certainly none will be permitted in canned goods, nor 
are tliev necessary. 



STERILIZATION. 219 

The apparatus for sterilizing canned goods is simple, consist- 
ing of retorts with lids which may be sealed; into these live steam 
is conducted and used either drv or with water and the retorts are 
exhausted to keep up the circulation, while the temperature is main- 
tained by a thermometer and steam gauge. 

For all vegetables, meats, soups and foods of albuminous na- 
ture, which furnish all the elements of nutrition for spore bearing 
bacteria, a temperature of 250° F. is better, than any lower degree, 
for the reason that spores perish at that degree of heat quickly ; the 
time required is variable owing to the numerous complications we 
have described, viz., the various species of bacteria to be destroyed, 
the character of the material, and its heat penetrability. Our ex- 
perience leads us to believe that dry Hve steam is more reliable 
than water, because circulation is more thorough, but there is al- 
ways some danger of discoloration, which may be avoided as fol- 
lows. A water connection is made with the water line by means of 
steam hose, to the lid of the retort, and a large overflow is made near 
the top of retort, so that a considerable volume of water may be let 
into it. just as the temperature drops to about 220^ F. after the 
cans have received a full process. The sudden rush of cold w'ater 
chills the goods, and stops the cooking which is still going on within 
the cans. Otherwise when the cans are thus cooking, and the lid is 
opened suddenly, the air striking the cans will cause discoloration, 
but if the retort is completely filled with cold water (before opening 
the lid), the color will remain good, and there will be no scorched 
taste imless the sterilization has been unnecessarily prolonged. 
250° F. is equal to about fifteen ix)un(ls pressure and may weaken 
the seams of the cans unless the chilling is done (with water) before 
their exposure to the atmospheric influences. 

Another method of sterilization coming into favor is the cal- 
cium process, which in some measure seems like a return to ancient 
methods, yet improved as it is, has some advantage over the ordin- 
ary steam retort system. The principle of obtaining a higher de- 
gree of heat than boiling water in a fluid, is based on the specific 
gravit'- '^f the fluid. By adding calcium to water the specific 
gravity. IS increased until temperatures of 240^ and even 250° F. 
may be obtained, without ebullition, consequently there is little or 
no escaping steam, and the temperature may be maintained at a 
very small expense, when compared to the cost of generating steam 
for retorts. 

The latest device consists of a long tank filled to a certain depth 
with calcium water, through which the crates containing the can.y 
are dragged on a carrier, which is slowly speeded to give the re- 
quired time for sterilization. After the cans are sterilized, they are 
carried through running water to cleanse them, and this also stops 



220 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

the cooking which is going on inside the cans after they have passed 
through the calcium bath. This process has the advantages men- 
tioned above, being a fuel and labor-saving method, but it cannot 
be used successfully for sterilizing glass goods, which require high 
temperatures. Glass goods are ditlicult to sterilize, owing to the 
breakage and the small expansive properties of glass. Glass goods 
of all kinds may be sterilized with dry steam at any temperature up 
to 250^' F., if the precautions are taken to raise and lower the tem- 
perature very slowly. The successful sterilization of glass goods 
depends largely upon the quality and thickness of the glass, also the 
method of sealing. The French hdvc been importing all kinds of 
fruits and vegetables put up in glass, but nearly all such goods are 
preserved with antiseptics of one kind or another, and while they 
look well, are not to be compared to the goods packed by many Am- 
erican canners. Glass seems to have the advantage over tin. in the 
opinion of many persons, because there is a mistaken and widespread 
belief that there is some danger of metallic poisoning from tin 
and the solder and flux used in sealing. It is a question, however, 
if there be more metal in tin goods than in some of the highly- 
colored French glass goods sold on the market. 

The writer has made a number of analvses of various canned 
goods for tin, lead and zinc, and the quantity of the first two are 
almost incalculablv small. The most definite amount of tin and 
lead were obtained from canned pineapple and California fruits, but 
no appreciable amount was obtained from these. Some samples 
sliowed the presence of more or less zinc, due to careless use of 
soldering solution. The old method of brushing the caps with an 
ordinary paste brush dipped in zinc chlorid has given way to the 
beautiful little machines which carry the solution on pencil brushes 
around the crease of each can. allowing none to be sucked in through 
the vent hole. 

Of course, glass snoods, if packed with care and without the use 
of preserving agents and metallic colors, are entirely free from 
metals, excepting where they are found in composition. Some 
vegetal)]e^ have iron and copper in composition. Tomatoes grown 
in \\'estern Pennsylvania contain some copper. 

The sterilization of goods in glass imparts a slightly scorched 
taste, because it is impossible to chill with water. The cooking 
goes on until the temperature drops below the boiling point. 

Another method of sterilizing canned goods has found favor 
among the packers of canned meats and sj^ecial food products. The 
apparatus is a monstrous affair requiring a great deal of room. 
The cans are placed in the carriers and allowed to pass through 
oil. which is heated to a certain temperature. This apparatus is 
used by the Armour Packing Co. of Chicago, and the results are 



STERILIZATION. 221 

very satisfactory. After the cans pass through the oil, they are 
drained and then carried through an alkahne solution, and then 
through running water. 

There are several methods employed now to avoid the old 
*S'enting" process and even in the canning of meats this is entirely 
obviated. The object of the venting process was two-fold, viz., to 
heat the contents of the can to obtain a vacuum, and to drive off 
unpleasant gases. Outside of tomatoes, there are hardly any pro- 
ducts cold packed unless special apparatus is employed. For or- 
dinary canning all that is necessary is to heat the syrup or liquid 
which is used to cover the fruits and vegetables, or to heat the vege- 
tables before filling into the cans; corn is thus heated before the 
filling. 

There are several devices used to pack certain goods without 
pre\'ious heating or "venting'' ; all these arc modifications of- the 
vacuum process. The cans are passed into a machine which ex- 
hausts the air by a vacuum pump, and w'hile in vacuo are sealed. 
The machine used in packing meats is interesting, because the "tip- 
ping'' or "dotting" is done in vacuo. The machine is round and 
carries the cans in 15 pounds vacuum, under a glass window; the 
inside is illuminated by incandescent light, and a small round disc of 
solder is melted by a copper, which is heated by electricity. The 
operator can look down through the window and melt the solder 
over each hole as the cans pass: when all have been "tipped,*' the 
vacuum is released and the cans pass out, when they are inspected 
for leaks. 

The old method of venting canned meats was difiicult, costly 
and uncleanly. The cans were filled cold, and a piece of tin was 
bent and soldered onto the under side of each cap to prevent the 
meat from coming up into the hole, which was made with an awl 
after the cans were heated the first time. The juice and grease 
would squirt all over everything when the cans were punctured and 
the closing of the holes was quite difficult, requiring skilled help. 

There are several kinds of vacuum machines on the market, 
but they require special cans. The lids of these cans are prepared 
with patent cement. The cans are put into the vacuum machine 
with the Hds loosely placed, and when the air is exhausted the lids 
are forced down into place and the cement holds the vacuum in the 
cans. The cans are made without soldering, except the body seam, 
the sealing being completed by crimping the flanges of the body 
together with the rims of both tops and bottoms. The cement com- 
ing between the two edges prevents leakage. 

These machines are used in European canneries and give good 
satisfaction. Recently, improved machines have been built in Am- 
erica for making these cans. These cans are also coated with a 



222 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

substance which is not attacked by fruit acids. The inside coated 
cans are preferable for goods of deHcate color. The ordinary cans 
are thus coated also. 

There is another method of sterilization used largely in bac- 
teriological work to destroy the bacteria in culture media, which 
become altered by high temperatures. It is called "Discontinuous 
Sterilization'' and was discovered by Prof. Tvndall during: his ex- 
periments and efforts to overthrow the theory of "spontaneous 
generation/' advanced by Von Liebig and his contemporaries. 

Prof. Tyndall experimented with all kinds of infusions made 
from meats, vegetables and grains, trying various degrees of heat 
from 212° to 300^ F., and prolonging the time for hours. These 
experiments are recorded in Tyndall's **Floating Matter of the Air." 
There is no question but that his experiments at 300° F. were faulty 
wherever he failed to sterilize his infusions in an oil bath. We have 
conducted numerous experiments, using various temperatures, and 
up to this time have never discovered any species of bacteria whose 
spores could withstand 250° F. moist heat for more than a few 
minutes. This statement must not be applied to the sterilization of 
canned goods, nor any material which is impervious to heat: it ap- 
plies only to that temperature directly upon the spores, which are in 
solutions or materials easily penetrated by heat. 

Tyndall's infusions were sterilized in glass flasks having a thin 
tube for escaping steam, w^hich was sealed by melting the glass to- 
gether while the steam was escaping. This would not be reli?ible, 
since the temperature must be lowered to melt the glass together, 
or else there would be a fine hole in the glass, which would be an en- 
trance for bacteria from the air. If the infusions were cooled to 
allow the perfect sealing of the glass, a vacuum would form in the 
interval and spores from the air could find entrance. 

There is no question but that 250- F. moist heat for twenty 
minutes will destroy all known spores, if the necessary precau- 
tions are taken to avoid contamination from the air. It is mar- 
velous how a small hole in the soldering of a can will be the means 
of spoiling the contents. Holes which are as small as a needle 
point, are wide open doors for such infinitely small vital powers as 
spores, and it is often difficult to find some of these leaks in spoiled 
cans. Through a hole the size of a period (.) 50,000 spores could 
pass side by side into a can without touching the metal. 

Discontinuous sterilization is conducted as follows: Moist 
heat, usually 212^ F., is applied to the material in water bath, for 
a time ranging from twenty minutes to one hour, after which it is 
placed in a cool place for one day, and the same process is then ap- 
plied a second time, and this is continued for three days, so that 
the material receives four processes, which render it sterile. 



STERIUZATION. 223 

The scientific principle is based on the time required for spores 
to vegetate. As we have stated in previous pages, the vegetating 
cells are easily destroyed; very few, indeed, are able to withstand 
1 80° F., and almost all perish at i6s^ F. Now the spores, being 
very resistant to heat, are simply softened during the first one or 
two processes, and readily perish when they begin to vegetate. 
Probably most of them are destroyed in two heating, but a few of 
the drier forms may require a day or two longer to swell up and 
vegetate, so that the four heatings will as a rule destroy all. 

As we have stated, there are certain materials which are chem- 
ically altered by high temperatures, and it is necessary to resort to 
the discontinuous method in order to prevent undesirable changes. 
Gelatin loses its solidifying properties if heated to 230° F. Milk 
is very much altered when heated even to boiling temperature, there 
being formed such substances as formaldehyde, dioxygen and cal- 
cium citrate, the latter being thrown down as a precipitate. Milk 
is therefore sterilized at about 165^ F. for one hour, on five consecu- 
tive days, to avoid these alterations. 

There are constantly made improvements on all methods of 
work and we believe that the discontinuous sterilization of canned 
goods by practical means offers a good field for experiment and 
study. On a small scale in laboratory work it is successful. All 
kinds of infusions of meats and vegetables are easily sterilized (in 
test tubes and flasks) by simply plugging the necks with cotton and 
heating in the manner just described. The color and flavor of such 
vegetables as corn, peas, string beans, asparagus, cauliflower, lima 
beans, etc. (when sterilized discontinuously), are very much su- 
perior to those of the regular canned goods, which have received 
240° or 250° F. The writer has made a number of such experi- 
ments and the results are gratifying. 

Sterilization by electricity, such as a direct current or an al- 
ternating current or the X-rays is not reliable, and by the first two 
certain chemical changes are produced which are undesirable. It 
was hoped and claimed that the X-rays would accomplish steriliza- 
tion by causing paralysis of the bacterial cells, but repeated experi- 
ments have demoastrated onlv failures. 

Sterilization by heat is the only method of value for the can- 
ning industry. There are some special products which are pre- 
served by chemicals, but these will no doubt be regulated by pure 
food laws in such a manner that only a minimum quantity of pre- 
servatives will be permitted, or perhaps none. 

One fact must not be lost sight of, however, and that is that * 
various fruits and vegetables contain within themselves certain 
acids and salts which make them easy to sterilize by heat; these ele- 
ments of composition act as antiseptics and in some cases as disin- 
fectants for many of the spore-bearing species of bacteria. 



224 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

It must not, therefore, be inferred that a certain process by 
heat actually destroys all life, but that all bacteria are prevented 
from multiplying through the destruction of some (by heat) and 
the antiseptic power of the juices. This may hold good so long as 
perfect fruits and vegetables are used and the complete elimination 
of all foreign matter is observed, but should unsound material be 
used or adulterations find favor, or should dirt or foreign matter 
get mixed in with good material through carelessness, the condi- 
tions will be changed, and the regular heating may not prevent de- 
composition. By avoiding adulterations and observing the strictest 
rules of cleanliness losses will be minimized. 

Certain fruits contain antiseptics, as we have stated, and cer- 
tain antiseptic compounds are formed by oxidation of sugars and 
fats, by the influence of light and at 250 degrees F. These antisep- 
tics play a very important part, as we have shown in sterilization, 
and it is our purpose to study the various compounds found in 
canned goods, and also the various antiseptics which are used to 
accomplish sterilization in special food products. 



PRESERVATIVES. 225 



CHAPTER VII. 
Preservatives 



What are Preservatives? — Preservatives are not Ordinarily Used 
in Canned Goods. — Some Food Products Require Them. — Nat- 
ural Origin of Preservatives in Food Products. — Statements 
made by Various Authorities Analyzed and Criticised. — Sterilized 
Catsups, Preserves and Fruit Butters not Satisfactorj- to the 
Trade. — Some Opposing Arguments Answered. 



It is well known that certain chemicals when added to food 
have a restraining influence upon the bacteria, yeasts and molds 
which are associated with its decomposition. Some chemicals pre- 
vent the multiplication of bacteria and are called antiseptics, while 
others will kill the germs and also the spores and are classed as 
disinfectants. It is difficult, however, to draw the line between 
antiseptics and disinfectants, for the reason that large quantities of 
the chemicals known as antiseptics, may also prove to be germicidal 
and therefore disinfectants, and, on the other hand, small quantities 
of chemicals known to be germicidal, may not destroy the life of 
bacteria and therefore only antiseptic. Some antiseptics when 
used in limited quantities favor the growth of certain bacteria and 
are used in obtaining pure cultures: the chemical will prevent the 
growth of some varieties which ordinarily overrun the culture plates. 
The term antiseptic is applied to a number of chemicals which are 
used to some extent in the preparation of foodstuffs, principally 
catsups, sauces, preserves, etc. They have been found in canned 
goods in some cases, no doubt, purposely added by the packers to 
shorten their sterilizing process, iDUt more commonly due to natural 
causes. 

The harmful nature of the various chemicals has been argfued 
pro and con by the best exponents of science, but their effect upon 
the human body is disputed, and the actual effect of some is not 
known. Thev mav be harmful or thev mav not be. but thev are con- 
sidercd (by the authorities) as unnecessary, and "the burden of 
proof, therefore, rests upon those who employ them." If they are 
not harmful, then thev mav be classed as adulterants (if used in 
canned goods) from the fact that they are largely unnecessary and 
do not add any nutritive value to the food. Tf they are harmful, 
there is sufficient ground for prohibiting their use. There can be 
no possible argument for the employment of chemicals as antiseptics 
in canned goods: 



226 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

I do not find that they are used to any great extent in canned 
goods, the methods of former years having been superseded by the 
more reHable and less expensive steriHzation by heat only. There 
may be some packers who use chemicals for preserving canned 
goods, but they are very ignorant of their business. The best 
houses sterilize all canned goods by steam heat either directly or in- 
directly, and do not increase the cost Iw adding expensive antisep- 
tics. 

Some of the published reports of antiseptics found in various 
brands of canned goods are absurd and misleading. There have 
appeared reports indicating that as many as three different chemi- 
cals were found in a single can. On the face of it, it is most unlikely, 
because no packer would be so foolish as to waste his money in this 
manner, and even if he should use the chemical method he would 
hardly use more than one as an antiseptic. 

Antiseptics have been too freely used in some kinds of food in 
the past and adulterants have been added to so many varieties of 
food that the public has rebelled and food commissioners have been 
employed to fix the responsibility upon guilty manufacturers and 
laws have been passed to prevent such products from being exposed 
for sale. Some of the reports made by analytical chemists will 
show to what extent this has been practiced, and while they may be 
overdrawn in cases, yet there is no doubt that such practices have 
gone beyond the limit of tolerance. 

It was claimed by one very radical food commissioner that it 
was no uncommon occurrence for a person to sit down to a meal 
having the following list of chemicals included in his diet : "Ham 
containing saltpeter; canned corn containing saccharin, salicylic acid 
and hyposulphite of soda ; canned peas containing copper and alum : 
tomato catsup containing benzoate of sodium and coal tar dye; 
wheat cakes containing ammonia or alum ; maple syrup made from 
cane sugar syrup and glucose; mustard containing tumeric: milk 
containing formaldehyde; coffee artificially prepared from various 
substances : pepper containing ground cocoanut shell, and butter 
containing borax. Verily one would have an internal drug house 
if this were continued day after day." It is hardly likely that a 
person would be so unfortiuiate as to meet with all these compounds 
in a single meal, yet it might happen that he would be confronted by 
a few of them at least. The claim is made that such combinations 
must in time cause trouble in the human stomach, because the juices 
which enter into the digestive processes were never intended to per- 
form the work of an analytical chemist three times each day. If 
such conditions actually existed there would be some ground for 
complaint, but canned goods packers are not responsible for these 
adulterations. There are some points worthy of consideration 



PRESERVATIVES. 227 

when dealing with the question as to whether antiseptics shall be 
prohibited in all food products. It is well known that bacteria are 
scavengers and more readily attack food which has been cooked, 
than food in the raw state ; the cooking seems to soften those foods 
containing fibre and releases the nutrient juices and fluids upon 
which the bacteria find suitable elements for growth. Bacteria . 
which produce ptomaines and toxins and disease parasites also flour- 
ish upon cooked food, and if that food is not consumed as soon as 
it is exposed, it may prove more dangerous than if it contained an 
antiseptic. There are many food products which are not eaten 
alone, but are used to give flavor and relish to other articles of pre- 
pared food. Such products may not be entirely consumed at a sin- 
gle meal and may be regarded as luxuries. Xow, if any of this 
class is subject to decomposition it would seem wise to use a certain 
per cent of antiseptic to preserve it. Under this head might be 
mentioned such articles of food as butter, cheese, tomato catsup, 
Chili-sauce, apple-butter, peach-butter, and other sauces and relishes. . 
The argument has been advanced that such foods may be prepared 
in small size packages, and thus avoid the necessity of carrying 
over from one meal to another, but the expense would be heavy, and 
in many cases would not be practical, especially for hotels and res- 
taurants. This is a question worthy of careful consideration and 
we believe that the manufacturer has a shade the better of the argu- 
ment. 

The great mass of our people do not care to waste money on 
glass or tin packages of small size. They want as much as possible 
of the contents, and as little as possible of the package in their in- 
vestments, and we believe that if a strict ruling were made against 
the employment of preservatives, it might prove to be a burden on 
the people or else would bar the masses from using these luxuries. 
It is difficult to draw the line, however, and a thorough test should 
be made of all modern preservatives to determine positively their 
effect upon human beings in the quantities ordinarily employed in 
food products. The honest manufacturer is ready to comply with 
any good national pure food law, so long as he is protected by that 
law. 

There are Ljome facts concerning antiseptics which are quite 
necessary to be known, and it was the author's privilege to bring 
them out at the convention of state food commissioners and chem- 
ists at St. Paul, Minn., in July, 1903. Various antiseptics are 
formed naturally in fruits and vegetable. Various antiseptics are 
formed during the processes of manufacture, especially where fer- 
mentation is employed, and where sterilization is accomplished at 
high temperatures. Antiseptics are formed where certain food pro- 
ducts are exposed to stron^^ sunlight ^ 



228 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

Prior to this convention there appeared published reports of 
analyses made by different state chemists who claimed to have found 
various antiseptics in canned goods. Knowing that certain brands 
of goods had been packed absolutely without the employment of 
these antiseptics, we began a series of analyses to determine their 
origin. We found that the chemists' reports were true in only a 
few cases, but we also found that antiseptics were formed in the 
manner stated above. The chemists who had been conducting the 
analyses for the people were pleased to learn the results of our in- 
vestigations, which placed the canner in a far better light than ever 
before. We believe that much good was accomplished at the con- 
vention and that the chemists and manufacturers understand each 
other better ; both sides were fair and willingly heard the arguments 
pro and con. 

Th^re are various fruits and vegetables which contain certain 
antiseptics. Whortleberries contain 0.6 to 0.8 gram of benzoic 
acid per liter (Lafar^s Technical Mycology, Section 80) . ; raspber- 
ries contain salicylic acid or phenol, as also does horseradish, which 
will prevent the acetification of cider in one part to three hundred 
and fifty. Currants contain benzoic acid and salicylic acid. Cher- 
ries, plums, crabapples, grapes, strawberries, apricots and peaches, 
contain salicylic acid in appreciable quantities. An analysis of 
cranberries was made by the author to determine the quantity of 
benzoic acid present naturally in them. From 125 grams of cran- 
berries we obtained 60 milligrams of the preservative. This is 
equivalent to one part to 2c8o, and we are quite sure that there was 
still more which could not be extracted. This is a very large 
amount of preservative to be found naturally in one of our finest 
fruits. In Ohio or Pennsvlvania anv one who sells cranberries is 
liable to be arrested and fined for selling an article of food contain- 
ing a substance wliicli is poisonous or injurious to health, according 
to the rulings of the pure food commissioners, and the decisions of 
the courts. vSome of the jams, preserves, fruit butters and jellies 
do not have any more of this preservative than occurs naturally in 
cranberries. Whv are cranberries so valuable and so much relished 
with turkey dinners? Is it not because the benzoic acid assists di- 
gestion, and also prevents any decomposition of tlie food which the 
stomach cannot quickly take care of? The benzoic acid prevents 
the bacteria from multiplying until tlie stomach catches up with the 
unusual amount of work forced upon it. 

Analyses were made of two lots of green gages to determine 
the presence of benzoic acid. These two lots were obtained from 
different places, which make? us reasonably sure that no benzoic acid 
had been added artificially. 500 grams were used, or about one 
pound for each extraction, and the seeds were broken. After pre- 
paring the fruit for the chloroform, several c. c. of 25 per cent sul- 



PRESERVATIVES. 229 

phuric acid was added, although this is not necessary. The fruit 
was then placed in a separatory funnel and 125 C; c. of chloroform 
was added and it was shaken up well several times. After a time 
the chloroform was drawn ofif before the formation of an emulsion. 
The extract was divided into three parts and after spontaneous 
evaporation tested for benzoic acid with the Ferric chlorid test, and 
benzoic acid was found. Mohler's test was then used, converting 
the benzoic acid into metadiamidobenzoic acid, which confirmed the 
first test. Both samples of green gages gave the reaction. Salicy- 
lic acid has been fourid in many different fruits as shown by the 

REPORT I^ROM MONTAXA EXPERIMENT STATION. 

"Arnong the fruits from which we have obtained the salicylic 
acid reaction are the following: Strawberries, raspberries (both 
red and black), blackberries, currants, plums, black cherries, apri- 
cots, peaches, Concord grapes, crabapples, standard apples and 
oranges. In a few instances we have this work quantitative \yith 
the following results: 

Currants, 0.57 mg. acid per kilo of fruit. 
Cherries, 0.40 mg. acid per kilo of fruit. 
Plums, 0.28 mg. acid per kilo of fruit. 
Crabapples, 0.24 mg. acid per kilo of fruit. 
Grapes. 0.32 mg. acid per kilo of fruit. 

These values, however, are not absolute, but only comparative, 
and represent the amount which we succeeded in extracting in each 
case. We distilled the fruit with phosphoric acid, extracted the dis- 
tillate with ether, took up with small amount of water, and applied 
the ferric chloride test after the ether had evaporated. Check analy- 
ses made with known amounts of salicylic acid showed that nearly 
all of the acid was extracted bv this method. Wc have also found 
the salicylic acid reaction to be given by tomatoes, cauliflower and 
string beans. 

It seems to us that the bearing of this work is very important, 
particularly as regards the investigations of food chemists. While 
these very small quantities may not react to the test for salicylic 
acid as usually applied, especially in view of the small amount of 
material generally worked upon (25 grams), yet a knowledge of 
its wide distribution may save reporting, on occasions, materials as 
adulterated to which salicylic acid has not been added. Knowing 
that salicylic acid may occur in many of the substances, either a 
quantitative determination will be necessary in each case, or it will 
be well to report only on strong reactions. 

We were led to this investigation by the protest of a well 
known reputable firm, in whose currant jelly we reported salicylic

acid, but which was present in no greater quantity than w^e have 
since found in fresh currants. A similar experience was lately had 
in one of the state laboratories for food control. 

In addition to the above work we are studying the distribution 
of benzoic acid in fruits and vegetables, and hope to be able to pub- 
lish our results within the year."

Tomatoes and acid fruits contain antiseptic properties in their 
juices. Formaldehyde is present in minute quantities in almost all 
foodstuff, which is exposed to the action of micro-organisms even 
for a short time, and the official sulphuric acid test will show it 
often I have seen milk drawn from the cow's udder and tested for 
formaldehyde, which gave a positive chemical reaction. There are a 
number of raw materials which undergo partial fermentation before 
they are worked into finished food products. During that fermenta- 
tion there are formed various chemicals which are elaborated by bac- 
teria; such as phenol, formic acid, sulphites and nitrates, and enough 
of these substances may be present in the finished goods to give 
the reaction in the ofiicial tests. Among the products which under- 
go fermentation as a part of the manufacturer's process are pickles, 
olives, onions, sauerkraut, tomatoes for catsup, cauliflower, herbs, 
garlic, soaked goods such as navy beans: pickled meats and various 
other raw materials. 

There are formed in some canned .qoods during sterilization at 
250° F., such compounds as formic acid, formaldehyde and dioxy- 
gen, which are due to the oxidation of fats and sugars. Some of 
these are formed always in canned corn, principally formaldehyde. 
In the presence of sunlight also certain raw materials and even fin- 
ished goods will form chemicals having strong antiseptic proper- 
ties, dioxygen being the most common (Novy's Laboratory Bac- 
teriology, page 70). ^lilk, when heated only to 212° F., will show 
the presence of formic acid and formaldehyde, and at 250° F. these 
give a very marked reaction, and the milk undergoes chemcial 
changes, such as the precipitation of calcium citrate and the forma- 
tion of dark fission compounds having an empyreumatic flavor. 
(Attested by numerous authorities.) 

Xow we must not understand by all these statements that 
enough of these antiseptic compounds are formed to arrest decom- 
position : indeed, such is the case only with a very few, and even in 
those, decomposition will eventually take place, but these facts are 



PRESERVATIVES. 231 

brought out to show that there may be some ground for the chem- 
ists' report on certain goods when they state that these antiseptics 
are present. On the other hand, these facts will serve the chem- 
ists and should enable them to make allowances for products formed 
during the process of manufacture, or those which have a natural 
origin in raw material, used in making up the finished food product. 
By conducting control tests and making a careful study of raw ma- 
terial, the chemist will be in a position to state positively if antisep- 
tics are purposely added, or whether they are of natural origin. 

From the very fact that nature produces so many examples of 
the natural formation of compounds witli marked antiseptic prop- 
erties, it would seem that the manufacturer might be allowed to 
follow nature's example in some cases. 

So much has been written and said on the harmfulness of pre- 
servatives in food within the last ten years that any further discus- 
sion might seem unwarranted. However, the subject is one of 
such vital importance to manufacturers of certain Food Products 
and Table Condiments, that any information of importance cannot 
fail to be interesting. A few years ago the warfare waged against 
the employment of salicylic acid became so strong, that laws were 
rapidly passed to stop its use in every article intended for food and 
drink. After the passage of these laws, the writer was one who 
strongly urged the manufacturers to cease using the chemical. At 
that time the question was one of obedience to State authority, how- 
ever dictatorial it might seem. In the absence of means and data 
to refute the charges made by famous medical and scientific author- 
ities, the manufacturers saw the measures presented and passed 
against them without being able to oppose them. I have always 
stood for strict obedience to the laws governing the employment of 
preservatives in Canned Goods, and so far as possible in other food 
products, but we need a thorough test of the statements made by 
the authorities who were responsible for the measures set against 
preservatives. 

Personally, / bclicz'c that salicylic acid one part in one thou- 
sand is not only non-injurious ichen employed in foods and drinks, 
zvhich are necessarily exposed to the action of bacterii, but is posi- 
tively beneficial, having a tendency to 'ivard off intestinal diseases, 
such as typhoid fez'cr and cholera. 

I do not wish to be misunderstood in this discussion of preser- 
vatives. So long as the laws prohibit the sale of or exposing for 
sale of goods preserved by means of salicylic acid, let us as manu- 
facturers, by all means live in ol^edience to them, and if we desire 
a change in the statutes, let us go about it in a way that will over- 
throw the statements made by those authorities who are responsible 
for the enactment of such laws. Our fir^^t step therefore will he to 



232 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

analyze the statement of these authorities and present facts which 
shall overthrow any theories, and if not entirely successful, to at 
least throw some shado\ys of doubt on them. It is an old saying 
that a statement never loses anything by repetition ; on the contrary, 
it gathers force and volume as it is repeated, so that a simple doubt- 
ful statement is sometimes expanded by frequent misquotation into 
an apparently positive fact. In the world of science we find that 
much of the literature is merely a copy of a true investigator's work, 
and we are mystified frequently by statements directly opposite com- 
ing from supposed authorities. Much of the scientific literature 
of the time should probably never have seen the light of day. be- 
cause the statements made are sometimes not borne out by facts. 
We find this state of affairs existing in the field of science, where 
a writer presumes to quote some other writer as an authority. Prob- 
ably the preceding writer misquoted an investigator, and a positive 
error is put down in a text-book under the authorship of one, whose 
titles protect him from vulgar criticism, when the fact is he was per- 
haps too preoccupied to make the investigation for himself. 

Dr. J. Dixon Mann is one of the most bitter opponents of sali- 
cylic acid in food and drink, and his evidence was accepted by the 
British Parliamcjitary Inquiry Commission, and is a sample of much 
similar evidence also accepted. I make the quotation in full so that 
no mistake may be made in the discussion : *Xast year in the sum- 
mer, at lunch in the- club, I took to drinking cider and continued 
taking it for many weeks. I began to feel a peculiar tendency to 
looseness in the bowels; furthermore, I felt never, as it were, 
thoroughly relieved after motions. This went on for a time and I 
could not understand how it was. I thought it was accidental in 
the first place, but it kept going on week after week. I did not 
care to take any medicine and I began to cast about for what possi- 
blv could be the cause of it. I went over the thing^s I had been 
in the habit of taking, and the things I was taking at the time. I 
could not think of anything until it struck me about this cider: so 
I got a bottle of the same sort from the steward of the club, took 
it to my laboratory, and found salicylic acid in it, and. needless to 
say. I have not taken cider since." I want to call particular atten- 
tion to the last few clauses of this testimonv: "And found salicv- 
lie acid." etc. Why did he not look for malic acid, succinic acid or 
some other substance? Xo. he found salicylic acid and jumped to 
the conclusion that it was the cause of his particular complaint. If 
he had shown a true scientific spirit, is it not reasonable to suppose 
tliat lie would have made a quantative analysis of the salicylic acid 
contained in the usual amount of cider which he was in the habit 
of drinking each day? After a time, when he was in perfect health, 
he could have taken the same amount of the acid mixed with other 
food, and then obtained more direct evidence. 



PRESERVATIVES. 233 

It is a source of wonder to me tliat such an eminent body of 
men as composed the ParUamentary Inquiry Commission should 
accept such evidence. 

The demand for preservatives to prevent fermentative and put- 
refactive processes in certain kinds of perishable food is so great, 
and the interests involved are so enormous, that snap judgment 
should not be taken against them. 

I have always written against the unnecessary employment of 
preservatives in canned goods or other foods which may be steril- 
ized by heat only, for the reason that it is expensive, unnecessary, 
and it is not wise to overdo the thing. It would not be wise to pre- 
serve everything with salt, it would not agree with us to have too 
much of it — harmless and necessary as it is, but we are quite satis- 
fied to have our hams, sausage, pickles, etc., so preserved. It would 
not be wise for us to preserve all our food with sugar, it would soon 
make us all sick, but we are satisfied to preserve our fruits, jellies, , 
jams, etc., with it, because at times we relish the change of diet. 
It would not be wise for us to preserve all our food by smoke (which 
is an application of creosote, phenol, etc.) ., but we are satisfied to 
have some of our meat put up in this fashion. It would not be wise 
to preserve all our food by sterilization in hermetically sealed pack- 
ages, because we want a change, yet we are satisfied to have a great 
variety so put up for winter use. Therefore an indiscriminate use ! 
of salicylic acid would be unwise, but when restricted to such foods 
as are subject to chemical changes by bacteria, it would be the part 
of wisdom to permit its use, provided it is not injurious to health. 

It has been so declared bv a number of authorities on the fol- 
lowing grounds : 

1. *'It is an antiseptic and anti-fermentative, and is therefore 
liable to interfere with the digestive processes by destroying the 
digestive ferments." 

2. "After absorption it is apt to injure the general health, and 
to interfere with nutrition." 

3. "It is an irritant, and is therefore apt to injure the mucous 
membrane of the stomach and intestinal canal.'' 

In the report of the Department Committee appointed to in- 
quire into the Use of Preservatives, etc., presented to both Houses 
by command of His Majesty. London. 1901 Tpage 96), is the testi- 
mony of Dr. Robert Bell, Fellow of the Faculty of Physicians and 
Surgeons of Glasgow, and Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons 
of Edinburg. He stated that he and his family had knowingly and 
regularly taken food containing antiseptics for eighteen years and 
without a sign of harm to any of them. "During the whole of that 
period we have never had a single case of illness in the house; when 
scarlet fever, measles, whooping-cough and other ailments were 



2 U CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

rampant, there was not a single one of our children ill. There is 
another family that I know very much in tlie same position as our- 
selves." 

In papers read before the Liverpool Medical Institution on 
Xo\'ember 20, 1902, by Dr. C. J. MacAlister, of Edinburgh, and 
Dr. T. R. Bradshaw, of Dublin, they gave their experiments with 
salicylic acid on digestive processes, and the digestive ferments. 
Quoting their report fully they said : "In this inquiry we have no- 
thing to do with the organized living ferments (bacteria, yeasts, 
molds, etc.). ; these are certainly killed by salicylic acid, and its 
efficacy as a food preservative depends upon that very fact ; but we 
have found that the digestive processes will proceed in the presence 
of the acid even in a solution of i to 500, which is practically satur- 
ated. 

Our first experiment was made with pepsin which, if active, 
should dissolve 2,500 times its weight of hard-boiled egg, and the 
Pharmacopoea provides the following test for its activity: "If 12.5 
grams of coagulated and firm white of egg, 125 c. c. of acidulated 
water containing 0.2 per cent muriatic acitl, 0.005 gramme of pepsin 
be digested together at 105^ Fahr. for six hours and shaken fre- 
quently, the coagulated white of egg should dissolve, leaving some 
flakes in solution. Having ascertained the activity of a specimen 
of pepsin by this experiment, we repeated it in two flasks each con- 
taining the above specified ingredients in their proper proportions, 
but to one of the flasks 0.250 gram of pure salicylic acid (which 
had previously been dissolved in eight c. c. of boiling water) was 
added, and at the end of six hours it was found that in the flask con- 
taining salicylic acid, there was only a small amount of white of 
egg left, none being left in the other flask." They go on to say. 
however, that the addition of salt to a tube containing pepsin and 
white of egg gave practically the same results, then they sum up 
the results of their experiments in words as follows : "We have 
found that salicylic acid exerts about the same retarding influence 
on the digestive processes, as do many articles, such as kitchen salt, 
which are always pre^^ent in a mixed diet. . . . the question therefore 
is not whether salicylic acid delays digestion at all, but whether it 
does so to a greater extent than other bodies, such as kitchen salt, 
which form part of an ordinary diet." 

The experiments of these two eminent authorities bring out the 
fact that salicylic acid does not interfere with natural digestion, and 
makes a clear distinction between organized or living ferments, such 
as bacteria, yeasts and molds, and the unorganized ferments or di- 
gestive enzymes, pepsin being most prominent. The opponents of 
salicylic acid have never shown the proper spirit of investigation. 



PRESERVATIVES. 235 

but rather a kind of theoretic deduction, jumping from one hypothe- 
sis to a conclusion without the sokition somewhat after this stvle. 

HYPOTHESIS — SaHcvlic acid destroys bacteria which are 
ferments. 

CONCLUSION — Therefore digestive processes are impeded 
because they depend upon ferments. 

We can readily see, therefore, how false the conclusion must 
be if it is made to depend upon the hypothesis, where the bacteria 
are called ferments without differentiation from unorganized fer- 
ments such as pepsin. We know that the living ferments are de- 
stroyed by the change produced in the cell protoplasm, resulting in 
plasmolysis, but in the unorganized ferment there is no cell proto- 
plasm and the action of the preservative cannot therefore be the 
same. 

' It should also be borne in mind that the opponents of salicylic 
acid have generally taken abnormally strong solutions of salicylic 
acid, to maintain their claims. Xo person ever takes this acid at 
meal time as strong as a cold water solution, yet this is a favorite 
(amount employed in experiments,) by those who would convince 
the people that they are dying of slow poisoning. 

An official of the Department of Agriculture recently stated 
that "The burden of proof, that preservatives are harmless to man, 
rests with the manufacturers who use them.'' Such a statement, 
when closely analyzed, is a deduction drawn from the testimony of 
\'arious medical authorities which have declared that preservatives 
are poisons and injurious to man. It implies that since preserv^a- 
tives have been so declared by those who ought to know, direct evi- 
dence to the contrary must be produced by manufacturers who use 
them. Therefore, some of them stand condemned as harmful, be- 
cause many authorities have stated that in their opinion such was the 
case. 

The taisk of proving the fallacy of many statements advanced 
by the opposition is no easy one. The public mind is already to 
some extent prejudiced against preservatives in food, simply be- 
cause some authorities have made the assertion that thev were harm- 
ful. There are a number of condiments which are commonly pre- 
served with such chemicals as salicylic acid, benzoate of sodium, 
and borax, the last two particularly. The condiments so preserved 
may be sterilized by heat only and they will remain pure and unfer- 
mented as long as the container is hermetically sealed. As a rule 
these condiments have a very deh'cate flavor which is greatly injured 
by a sterilizing process sufficiently prolonged to destroy the yeasts, 
molds and spores of bacteria present in them. I have been con- 
ducting a series of experiments with such goods for the past six 
years. Many carloads of condiments put up in glass and sterilized 



236 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

by heat only have been sent out to the trade. It is a remarkable 
fact that such goods have failed to give general satisfaction for 
three reasons. Tliey have a slightly scorched taste, or a pasteurize*.! 
taste and odor. The natural color is somewhat darkened and the 
goods soon spoil after the containers are opened. We have found 
that tomato catsup which has been sterilized by heat only is greatly 
injured in flavor and wiil not keep for more than five days after the 
bottles are opened. Frequently fermentation sets in about the third 
or fourth day and mold will be visible to the eye in four or five days. 
Another remarkable fact brought out in these experiments was 
the preference shown by the consumers for condiments prepared 
with preservatives over the same goods sterilized by heat only. In 
many cases the facts were made clear to the consumer. The conse- 
quence was that much of the pure goods still remains unsold on 
the grocer's shelves, while those prepared with preservatives are 
selling rapidly. 

Catsup both with and without preservatives, has been placed 
throughout Kentucky, ilinnesota and the Dakotas, and a large 
per cent of that sterilized by heat only remains unsold, and the trade 
has been greatly injured owing to the loss of flavor. 

Now let us examine the reasons for this difference in flavor. 
Why is it that the flavor is injured more by heat than by preserva- 
tives. It is well known that preservatives destroy flavor, especially 
if used in excess, and we know that heat will not injure the flavor 
very much unless it is prolonged. 

In preparing table condiments with preservatives, the manu- 
facturer does not plan to destroy the organized ferments such as 
molds, yeasts and bacteria, but to prevent their multiplication or 
growth. The chemical chans^es caused by fermentation are pro- 
duced during the multiplication of the organized ferments. The 
elements necessary for the multiplication of ferments are obtained 
from the carbohydrates and other complex substances, and there are 
formed new chemical compounds greatly diff^ering in taste and odor 
from the original substance. Therefore preservatives are added in 
just sufficient amounts to prevent the multiplication of these fer- 
ments. Xo attempt is made to destroy them, because, as a rule, 
they are non-pathogenic and are not harmful to the human organ- 
ism in small numbers. Very few of the preservatives ordinarily 
used in preserves, apple-butter, tomato catsup. Chili-sauce, etc.. are 
antiseptic, strictly speaking, and certainly they are not germicidal 
in the quantities used. This accounts for the spoilage of such con- 
diments after a time, because ordinary preservatives finally lose 
their preventative power. 

Sterilization by heat only is a far different problem. All spores 
of veasts, molds and bacteria must be destroved absolutely. One 



PRESERVATIVES. 237 

or two spores are jusj; as dangerous as millions, if they remain alive. 
From one spore there will spring into existence many millions of 
the same species within a very short time, where the temperature 
and other conditions are favorable. In order to completely sterilize 
table condiments considerable heat is necessary, owing to the density 
of the goods and the size of the container. Goods of this kind are 
usually sold in glass, because tin is not suitable for them, owing to 
their high acidity which attacks the tin plate vigorously. Steriliza- 
tion requires boiling for perhaps thirty or forty minutes to destroy 
all spores. The organisms near the outside, of course, perish 
quickly, but those in the center do not get the required temperature 
for a considerable time, varying with the diameter of the container 
and the density or penetrability of the goods. Certain portions of 
such packages, therefore, receive more heat than is necessary for 
the destruction of ferments, and of course, the flavor suffers ac- 
cordingly. If such goods could be heated uniformly, the loss of 
flavor would still be greater than in the same goods containing pre- 
servatives sufficient to inhibit bacterial growth, because complete 
destruction is necessary in the one, while inhibition only is necessary 
in the other. 

Our claim for the necessity of preservatives in food of slow 
consumption is a good one, because it has been demonstrated that 
the people prefer such goods with as near the natural flavor as it 
is possible to make them, and sterilization by heat does destroy much 
of the original flavor. Our conclusions are thus summed up: 

J. The ordinary preservatives employed for preserving goods 
of slow consumption are valuable and necessary, because in no 
other way can the original flavor of such goods be retained. 

2, The consumer prefers this class of goods even when he 
knows that preservatives ha\'e been used to keep them in an unfer- 
mented state. 

This does not dispose of the question, *'Are such preservatives 
Iiarmful to the human organism?" but it is encouraging to note that 
the consumer is better pleased with table condiments so preserved. 

The testimony oflfered before the Parliamentarv Committee 
by a large number of physicians and professional men is interesting, 
and is remarkable for its utter lack of evidence based on experi- 
mental investigation. One physician after another is called before 
the committee, and nearly all evidence is founded on mere opinion 
or the result obtained by abnormal quantities of preservatives. True 
investigation had not been made by many, and those who had done 
any experimental work did not produce the notes and data to prove 
their claims. The following testimony was offered as evidence be- 
fore the Parliamentarv Committee. From the Blue Book, Xo.

238 canning and preserving of food products. 

Mr. Henry Droop Richmond. 

Question, "With regard to the action of salicylic acid on 
enzymes, is your opinion of that subject based upon what you have 
read or upon what you have done? You say that salicylic acid lias 
an action on the enzymes." 

Answer, "I think it is chiefly based upon what I have read. 
I have also found that the action of certain enzymes, diastase for 
instance, is stopped by salicylic acid/' 

The first part of this testimony is indeed very like that of many 
others. Nearly every opposed authority, when called upon to ex- 
press his opinion as to the action of salicylic acid on enzymes, al- 
most unhesitatingly states that it is his opinion that this preserv^a- 
tive retards, or prevents the digestion of food in the stomach and 
when pressed as to the basis of his opinion, like every one of his 
predecessors, he states that he has read it. Probably the author of 
the book also read it as a quotation from some author in the middle 
of the last century. 

Digestive processes were unknown up to the time when Theo- 
dore Schwann in 1836 discovered that the gastric juice contained 
pepsin, and it was only three years previous that Payen and Perzos 
discovered diastase in malt extract. All literature previous to the 
discovery of enzymes and organized ferments made no distinction 
between them. 

This idea has been carried down in various scientific works ever 
since, and it is no very uncommon thing to read extracts (which 
contain the essence of this fallacy), published within the last few 
years by authorities who have never given this subject any inves- 
tigation. 

Fermentation is a term very greatly misinterpreted; it is re- 
peatedly treated as a process which is brought about by bacteria, 
yeasts, and molds, and likewise by the enzymes of digestion. This 
is a great error, and finds expression in such productions as the fol- 
lowing: 

North Dakota Agricultural Experiment Station. Bulletin 53. 
Page 119. In the Alinnesota Dairy and Food Commissioner's Re- 
port for 1 90 1 this statement appears — presen-atives "are used solely 
to prevent fermentation and since the processes of digestion are 
fermentation processes, the chemical preservatives must work an 
injury." And also, 

In Bulletin 100 of the Kentucky Agricultural Experiment Sta- 
tion, a well-known officer of the State Food Commissioners' Associ- 
ation says : "The strong paralyzant power claimed for antiseptics 
is sufficient to condemn their use in foods, for a substance which 
can preserve perishable foods under any conditions, and for any 



PRESERVATIVES. 23» 

length of time, will also affect the delicate digestive ferments of the 
stomach," and he quotes a government authority in these words : 
'*There is no preservative which paralyzes the ferments which cre- 
ate decay, that does not at the same time paralyze to the same ex- 
tent, the ferments that produce digestion. . . . The very fact that 
any substance preserves food from decay shows that it is not fit to 
enter the stomach." 

I was much surprised that the authority mentioned in Bulletin 
I GO by the writer of that article should have made such a statement, 
so when in New York later I asked the gentlemen, who is a mem- 
ber of the Committee on Food Standards, if he had been quoted 
correctly, and he stated that he had never authorized that state- 
ment. It is, therefore, up to our Kentucky friend to verify his quo- 
tation. 

So far as I am aware this statement did not appear in print 
until Bulletin loo brought it out, and it has been copied and changed 
to fit any argument opposed to preservatives by the daily press and 
the authorities in many states. In the light of modern research it 
is ridiculous. Any investigator could prove its falsity in a few 
hours* experiment. Every physiologist knows that hydrochloric 
acid is present in the stomach and is absolutely necessary in the 
digestive process. Every one knows that it is an antiseptic, and it 
is frequently combined with such disinfectants as bichlorid of mer- 
cury to increase their antiseptic properties, which it does, from 50 
to 100 per cent. It will absolutely prevent the multiplication of 
bacteria in 0.2 per cent solutions, which is the amount found in 
the normal stomach during digestion. Yet if we were to accept the 
statement quoted in Bulletin 100, we would expect to have our di- 
gestive apparatus completely paralyzed after every meal. 

The bile acids are antiseptics, principally taurocholic acid, 
which is nearly as powerful as salicylic acid, so affirmed by the 
following authorities: Lindenberger (Bulletin de la Societe imp. 
des naturalistes de Moscow, 1884) : also Bunge's Physiological and 
Pathological Chemistry, second edition, pages 184 and i8> quotes 
as authority ^laly and Enrich jMonatshefte (Chemistry, Vol. IV, 
page 89) ; also Glev and Lambling (Revised biology du Nord de la 
France, Vol. I, 1886.) 

After every meal, when the food reaches the duodenum, the 
bile flows into it carrying the antiseptic taurocholic acid, and not- 
withstanding the statement that antiseptics paralyze the ferments, 
the digestion is stimulated instead. Wc are almost ready to turn 
the argument quoted by our Kentucky writer and make it apply in 
the opposite way, thus, "the ferments that produce digestion are 
stimulated by antiseptics in the same proportion that the organisms 
which produce decay are paralyzed." 



240 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

Prof. Prescott, of the University of Michigan, is quoted in 
Bulletin No. 53, page 118, of the North Dakota Agricultural Sta- 
tion, as follows : '*A food that is braced against decomposition may 
be found to be braced against digestion." I am quite sure that the 
author never intended this to be garbled in this manner by anyone, 
because the statement has an element of truth in it. Antiseptics are 
not used to completely brace foods against decomposition; indeed 
it mav be truly said that manufacturers of table condiments such 
as catsup, Chili-sauce, apple-butter, peach-butter, preserves, jam, 
jellies, etc., do not use preservatives to completely retard decom- 
position, but to assist the sugar and the container to arrest fer- 
mentation until such foods are consumed. It is well known that 
any of these manufactured products will spoil within a certain time 
after the original package is opened. Then again, some foods are 
chemically changed by high temperatures so that they become in- 
digestible. Even the dark brown crust of bread is thus changed by 
heat in the baking process, ililk is changed to some extent in pas- 
teurization and complete sterilization. Then again the author 
quoted uses the words "may be" because he undoubtedly recognized 
the fact that his statement could not apply in all cases and be made 
to do duty as an argument against preservatives in general. 

In the report of 1892, of the Committee on Interstate and For- 
eign Commerce of the House of Representatives, on the pure food 
bills, page 395, it is stated that *Trof. ]\Iitchell, of Wisconsin, con- 
siders any active antiseptic necessarily deleterious to health. It 
retards the processes of the stomach, stopping the working of the 
normal enzvmes or ferments." 

In the light of our experiments with salicylic acid and pepsin, 
and from what we know of hvdrochloric acid and taurocholic acid, 
such statements as that of Prof. Mitchell are ridiculous. Here 
again we ha\'e an opinion given with no data or experiments to 
prove it true, and that opinion is on record to be quoted as an es- 
tablished fact for years to come. Now here is another opinion 
w^hich is directly opposite to the statement made by Prof. Mitchell. 
The professor of Physiological Chemistry at Yale University de- 
clares tliat ^'Antiseptics do not interfere with digestion" (page 396 
of the same report). This opinion, coming as it does, from such 
high authority, and based upon personal investigation, as we know 
it to be, throws a shadow on the i^rofessor from Wisconsin. Here 
is another opposing opinion by Dr. E. H. Starling, Fellow of the 
Roval Collesre of Phvsicians and a Fellow of the Roval Societv. 
(Blue Rook Report of tlie Parliamentary Committee Xo. 6941. i)age 
243-) 

Question, "^^'hat have von (o tell 11s as regards salicvlic 
acid?^' 



PRDSBRVATIVBS. 241 

Anszver, "Salicylic acid is certainly harmful, less, however, 
than formalin. In an acid medium, that is to say, the medium in 
which the stomach digestion goes on, it acts as an antiseptic, but in 
tlie stomach where it is acting as an antiseptic, it also prevents the 
action of the gastric juice and stops digestion in the stomach. 
Clinically, of course, one knows that the use of salicylic acid, especi- 
ally in the free state, is apt to cause symptoms of gastric dyspepsia, 
pain in th^ stomach, and stoppage of gastric digestion, etc." 

This authority states in the beginning of his testimony, that 
he had made physiological experiments with salicylic acid, but he 
does not state what they were, nor how they were made. He does 
not state whether he used small doses or whether he administered 
abnormal quantities. We know that his testimony as to the stop- 
page of digestive processes in the stomach is absolutely false, if he 
used less than one part to 500, because we have demonstrated by 
actual experiment that digestive processes are a little delayed but not 
entirely stopped, as he stated the case. In quantities less than one 
to 500 the delay is not noticeable and in either case the delay is no 
greater than that caused by many substances, such as common salt, 
coffee, tea, etc., which enter the stomach in a mixed diet. 

Clinically, salicylic acid is a fine remedy for fermentation, 
caused by living organisms in the stomach. It not only destroys the 
bacteria, but actually assists the gastric juices in the digestion. Two 
cases of this nature have come under my personal notice, so this 
would indicate that the testimony of Dr. Starling was not as sci- 
entific as it should have been. He goes on to say, "When the food 
gets down to the intestines, where the medium is alkaline, and where 
it is attacked by the pancreatic juice, salicylic acid does not disturb 
digestion, and there, of course, it does not act as an antiseptic." 
Late investigation has shown that salicylic acid is decomposed in 
the stomach into carbonic acid and phenol, which are carried off 
by the urine. 

Prof. William Henry Cornfield was called before the com- 
mittee and testified as follows : "I have had wtvy little practical ex- 
perience on the results of the internal administration of salicylic 
acid, but I have studied the effects of it as thev have been observed 
and published by others." This statement was all right, and he 
probably said just what all the other witnesses should have said, 
but he goes on with his testimony just as if he had made a deep 
physiological and chemical research. Note his answer to question 
5067 (i>age 177). "Suppose a person were taking a small quantity 
of salicylic acid day by day, is it certain he could get rid of the 
whole of that quantity in each day ?" Answer — "I do not think it 
is." Question No. 5077 (page 177) : "Might there be a tendency 



242 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

to accumulation?" "Yes; I think there is evidence that there is 
a tendency to accumulation with that drug." 

As we stated before, there is no evidence to show anything of 
the sort, and it is well known that salicylic acid and some other 
preservatives are almost entirely excreted in the urine and perspira- 
tion. Like all chemical work this test- shows a very slight amount 
which cannot be accounted for, but when the decrepancies are taken 
into consideration in other analytical work, it is a fair presumption 
that the unaccounted per cent, is a chemical decrepancy due to in- 
accuracy in analysis. 

I have been impressed while reading over a large amount of 
testimony offered on various preservatives, that only rarely is 
a specific quantity named. We have all along presumed that no 
greater amount of preservative should be used for physiological 
research work than it is possible for anyone to actually consume 
daily in food. This is not more than one part in 500 in some few 
articles, and not more than one part in 2000 in others. It is hardly 
likely that anyone would eat as much as one part of salicylic acid to 
1000 parts of general food and fluids. This proportion would be ver}- 
high indeed, and I do not believe that such an amount of preserva- 
tives is ever used continuously by anyone. 

Any physician could say that certain amount of preserv^atives 
would prove harmful, and the same thing could be said of fire — 
a certain amount of heat is absolutelv necessar\% but we cannot 
reason that because a certain amount of heat will burn us that we 
should not use heat — such reasoning would be absurd. Heat is 
good, but too much of it must certainly stop digestion; sugar, salt, 
coffee, tea, etc., are all good in certain amounts, but too much of any 
will stop digestion, therefore any testimony which does not specify 
a fixed amount of preserv^ative that is harmful has no value as evi- 
dence, except in Pennsylvania. 

We have gathered considerable evidence, as our readers have 
found, to show that the statements by various authorities on the 
harmful action of salicylic acid on gastric digestion are not strictly 
in accordance with facts. We have yet to speak of the argument 
advanced by several investigators to the effect that the diastatic 
enzyme, ptyalin of the saliva, is stopped by such preservatives as 
salicylic acid and benzoic acid. 

In order to answer this argument, put up by Prof. H. A. 
Weber and others, we must outline the whole digestive process and 
consider the nature of each enzyme, and then learn how wisely Na- 
ture has planned the whole apparatus so that disturbances in one 
quarter do not necessarily disturb the whole process. 

The ptyalin or diastatic enzyme of the saliva is secreted in an 
alkaline fluid, and its process is carried on in an alkaline fluid. 



PRESERVATIVES. 243 

(Gamgee's Physiological Chemistry of the Animal Body 1893, 
pages 23-27). 

The pepsin or albumen digesting enzyme is acid and requires 
the presence of an acid ; even small quantities of alkaline solution 
render it inert. (Langley, Journal of Physiology, III. page 246). 

The trypsin or albumen digesting enzyme of the pancreas 
"works best in a weak alkaline solution." (Ferments and Their 
Action, page 39, Oppenheimer. ) Weak acid solutions do not great- 
ly interfere with it, but any solution containing as much acid as the 
gastric juice (estimated at 0.2 per cent.) Would stop this enzyme. 

Now this is certain, therefore, that any acid or alkaline taken 
either as a food or in food, must have some influence on one or more 
of these enzymes. It is the acid in such preservatives as salicylic and 
benzoic acids that has a retarding influence on the diastatic enzyme 
of the saliva. If this action is to be considered harmful by the op- 
ponents of preservatives, and if this is to be considered as a reason 
for prohibiting preservatives, then the same objection must be filed 
against every acid food. Lemonade, phosphated drinks, acid fruits 
of all kinds, have a far greater influence on the ptyalin than all the 
added preservatives one could take in food, as it is now prepared. 

The pepsin of the gastric juice is retarded by all alcoholic 
drinks, beer, wine, etc. "Beer, even when containing less than three 
per cent, of alcohol, has a strong restrictive action, and this is not 
to be ascribed to the hops, since wine has the same effect." (Fer- 
ments and Their Action, page 96; also Buchner, Arch. f. klin. Med., 
XXIV. 537.) 

Tea and coffee also retard the action of the pepsin on coagu- 
lated egg albumen, demonstrated in National Canners' Laboratory, 
June "Index," 1904. Frazer also authorizes this conclusion. 
(Journal of Anatomy and Physiology, XXXL, page 469.) 

The amount of salt usually taken in a single meal retards peptic 
digestion as much, if not more, than all the preservatives taken in 
food during the same meal. (National Canners' Laboratory Re- 
port for May "Index," 1904. 

Now note the following: "The gall normally precipitates the 
pepsin, but when this function is absent — e. g., in fistula — ^the pep- 
sin penetrates into the intestines and destroys the trypsin to a more 
or less pronounced extent, and thereby the digestion of the albumen 
is checked." (Ferments and Their action, page 109.) 

The arguments based on the ground that preservatives should not 
be used in food, because they restrict or retard the digesting enzymes, 
grow very weak in the face of the facts presented here. If our 
physical economy were so delicately constructed and so easily upset, 
we would all be constant sufferers from indigestion. Nature has 
provided a way to neutralize acids and salts and means of throwing 
off unnecessarv and undesirable substances. 



244 CANNING AND PRBSERVINO OP FOOD PRODUCTS. 

Since it has become known among scientists that the preserv- 
atives commonly used in food products are largely excreted by the 
kidneys, a claim has been set up that the extra amount of work 
which is forced upon these already over- worked (?) organs, will 
necessarily lay the foundation for kidney diseases of various kinds. 
In Bulletin No. loo of the Kentucky Agricultural Experiment Sta- 
tion, page loi, speaking of preservatives, the writer says that "they 
are eliminated by the kidneys and that such elimination g^ves rise 
to various forms of kidney trouble." 

This statement is made without any quotation from medical 
literature to sustain it, and the reason is obvious, since no such 
statement is thus made, so far as I am able to find. A question 
was once asked of a noted physician, "Within the last few years 
Bright's disease has increased, and is it not possible that preserva- 
tives in food products might be one of the principal causes?" He 
answered that he did not think so, because there are several other 
causes at work, which had such direct responsibility for kidney dis- 
eases, that it was hardly likely that preservatives commonly used 
in food products were in any way contributory; that more kidney 
diseases were directly caused through invasion by microorgan- 
isms, such as the gonococcus and bacterium pyocyaneus, also 
streptococcus and staphylococcus aureus et al; and since such 
increase of gonorrhoeal infections has been reported by the var- 
ious medical societies, kidney diseases may be traced in many cases 
directly to this malady. It is reasonable to suppose that preserva- 
tives would have an antiseptic influence on micro-organisms which 
invade the kidneys, and as antiseptics they would prove beneficial, 
as indeed they are, and are prescribed in medicinal doses for that 
very purpose. There is a theory that antiseptics taken in food con- 
tinuously must exert an irritating influence on the kidneys, and 
eventually must cause abnormal changes, followed by the invasion 
of micro-organisms. 

The kidneys are endowed by nature with the power to dis- 
solve all kinds of irritating and poisonous substances from the blood 
stream, and afterwards to expel them through the urine, so it is not 
a fair presumption to suppose that they are injured because certain 
substances are supposed to have irritating properties. We should 
naturally expect to find some evidence of irritation on the mucous 
membrane of the stomach prior to any injury of the kidneys. In 
cases of Brighf s and kindred diseases, the post mortems often re- 
veal the fact that the stomach is normal in every way, and this 
would seem to prove that hyperplastic processes were caused 
through invasion by bacteria. 

There is very little medical testimony to prove that diseases of 
the kidneys are due to overwork in eliminating substances which 



PRESERVATIVES. 245 

pass unchanged through the body. One writer has mentioned salt 
as a substance excreted by the kidneys. This chemical passes 
through the body as sodium chlorid and does not cause any ab- 
normal processes of kidney degeneration. Another writer speaks 
of water as a substance which passes unchanged through the body 
and is excreted by the kidneys without any injury to them; there- 
fore, it is not a sound argument that because a substance passes 
unchanged through the body, it must overwork the kidneys. 

There are probably no organs of the human body more ad- 
mirably capacitated for work than the kidneys. There are two 
of them, and ordinarily there is very little more than enough work 
for one; the other is always ready, however, to assist in the elimina- 
tion of foreign substances from the blood stream. Some experi- 
ments have been made with animals to determine working capacity 
of the kidneys, and it was proven that three-fourths of a kidney 
could be cut away before any serious consequences could be detected. 
(Albutt's System of Medicine, Vol. IV., p. 318.) 

Americans consume large quantities of nitrogenous foods 
and an unusual amount of work is forced upon the kidneys in order 
to expel the nitrogen, but there are a number of cases on record 
where human beings have lived for many years with only one kid- 
ney, which had to do all the work devolving upon these organs. 
This would indicate that any person having two normal kidneys 
would not be seriously overworking them by allowing them to ex- 
pel a very small quantity of such preservatives as salicylic or benzoic 
acid. 

The kidneys must excrete the uric acid from the body, and 
salicylic acid is helpful in its removal, and for this reason the pre- 
servative IS given as a remedy for rheumatism. (Practical Thera- 
peutics-Hare, page 341.) 

Salicylic acid unites with ,?lycin, forming salicyluric acid; 
also, benzoic acid unites with glycin, forming hippuric acid, and both 
of these antiseptics are, therefore, helpful in assisting the kidneys 
to expel the glycin, or as it is commonly called glycocoll, or amido- 
acetic acid. (Cushny-Pharmacology and Therapeutics, page 417.) 

In the London Lancet of November 25, 1899, page 1,427, 
Cushny rather opposed salicylic acid, because it was excreted from 
the body in a form unlike any product of normal urine, but he did 
not oppose benzoic acid because it was excreted as hippuric acid, 
which is found in normal urine. 

Dr. R. G. Eccles has pointed out the false reasoning in this, 
however, because: 

Salicyluric acid is salicylic acid plus glycin. 

Hippuric acid is benzoic acid plus glycin. 

In other words, there is very little difference between the two, 
salicylic acid being simply equivalent to hippuric acid plus water. 



246 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

"As glycin or glycocoUic acid ia a precursor of urea, its remov- 
al by means of salicylic or benzoic acid, aids the body in gjetting 
rid of its waste product." (American Text-book of Physiology, 
page 981, also Foster's Text-book of Physiology, page 539.) 

It would seem from this that preservatives such as these are 
beneficial rather than detrimental. Normal kidneys cannot be in- 
jured by them, and since they are antiseptic by nature, it is fair to 
presume that any one who is suffering with kidneys diseased by 
invading bacteria must be benefitted by the preservatives which have 
inhibitory influence upon bacterial life, providing that such antisep- 
tics are not taken in doses large enough to be irritating or to cause 
cellular metabolism.

Experiments With Preservatives and Other Substances to Deter- 
mine Their Effect on Peptic Digestion. Physiological and Path- 
ological Research Work With Animals Fed on Salicylic and 
Benzoic Acids. Post Mortems. Conclusions. 



EXPERIMENTS WITH PEPSIN. 

A number of flasks were prepared, using the formula for test- 
ing the activity of pepsin given in the Pharmacopoea. A series 
of experiments were made as follows : 

Flask No. I. — 

12^ grams hard boiled white of egg, 
125 c. c. pure water. 
0.2 per cent, hydrochloric acid. 
0.005 gram of pepsin. 

Flask No. II. 

Just the same as No. i with the addition of J4 gram of salicylic 
acid dissolved in water. 

Flask No. III.— 

Just the same as Xo. i with the addition of % gram of com- 
mon salt. 

Flask No. IV.— 

Just the same as No. i with the addition of one loopful of 
Bacillus Vulgaris and one loopful of a bacillus found in corn. 

All these flasks were kept for six hours in the incubator at a 
temperature of 150° F. and agitated frequently. 

No. I showed only a few flakes, and all the rest had a small 
quantity of egg still undigested. After two or more hours these 
were just like No. i. 

This proves that salicylic acid in very strong solutions does not 
impede digestion more than other substances consumed in a mixed 
diet, common salt retarding fully as much as the acid. Ordinary 
bacteria taken at meal time have the same retarding influence, al- 
though the amount of hydrochloric acid used prevented them from 
propogating. 



248 CANNING AND PRESERVING OP FOOD PRODUCTS. 

In order to test the retarding influence of various substances in 
comparison with preservatives, a number of flasks were prepared 
as follows: 

Flask No. I— 

125 cubic centimeters of water. 

T2.5 grams of hard boiled white of egg, finely divided. 

0.005 gram of pure pepsin. 

0.2 per cent hydrochloric acid. 

Flask No. II— 

Just the same as Xo. I with the addition of 0.25 gram of pre- 
servative commonly used in food products. Benzoic Acid. 

Flask No, III— 

Just the same as No. I with the addition of 0.25 gram of 
ground coffee. 

Flask No. IV— 

Just the same as No. I with the addition of 0.25 gram of green 
tea. 

Flask No. V— 

Just the same as No. I with the addition of 0.25 c. c. of absolute 
alcohol. 

Flask No. VI— 

Just the same as No. I with the addition of o.io gram of salicy- 
lic acid, o.io gram of coflfee and o.io gram of tea. 

These were placed in the incubator and kept for six hours at 
105° F. and frequently shaken. The results are most interesting. 

In flask No. 5 the coagulated tgg albumen dissolved first ; that 
in No. I was second ; No. VI was third with just a few flakes un- 
dissolved ; No. II was fourth ; No. IV was not complete ; and No. 
Ill was decidedly retarded, fully half of the tgg remained undi- 
gested. No. VI was the most interesting from the fact that it con- 
tained three substances which are claimed to retard digestion. This 
flask contained coffee, tea and salicylic acid and complete digestion 
of the tgg albumen followed the typical experiment represented in 
flask No. I. It can be explained in but one way — i. e., that the 
small quantity of salicylic acid used acted as a stimulant. 

Flask No. V, containing the absolute alcohol, was the first to 
complete the digestion of the egg albumen, and we must conclude 
that a very small per cent of alcohol stimulates digestion, while we 
know that when the per cent is increased to 3 it greatly retards di- 
gestion. (Buchner, Arch. f. Klin. Med. XXIX-537.) 



PRESERVATIVES. 249 

We find that salicylic acid in minute quantities stimulates di- 
gestion. This is true of all acids. (Oppenheimer — Ferments and 
Their Action, page 97.) 

In the proportion of i to 500 it retards digestion slightly, just 
about as much as common salt, and in larger amounts it will pos- 
sibly interfere with digestion. The conclusion to be drawn is that 
the amount of any substance is a very important factor in deter- 
mining its action on digestive processes. Certain quantities may 
be positively beneficial, while increased amounts may be injurious. 

FEEDING PRESERVATIVES TO ANIMAI^S, POST MORTEM, AND PATHO- 
LOGICAL ANALYSES OE INTERNAL ORGANS. 

One of the arguments advanced by the opponents of food pre- 
servatives is the opinion of many eminent physicians that the deli- 
cate mucous membrane of the stomach will become irritated and 
inflamed, and thereby be injured to a greater or less degree, if pre- 
servatives, and particularly salicylic acid, be taken continuously in 
food and drink. This objection, although founded as we believe 
on nothing but mere speculation, would seem to be a very strong 
one indeed. We all know how easily the stomach responds to the 
action of chemicals and even to the influence of the mind. The 
cells of the mucous membrane are very sensitive to any influence 
not exactly in accord with normal conditions. Even the state of 
the nerves of the body has an influence ; nauseating odors and dis- 
gusting sights are influences which completely upset the stomach. 
Anger, passion, joy, sorrow and other influences of the mind act 
upon the cells of the mucous membrane, and for a time the stomach 
cannot perform its work normally. We all know that certain 
drugs, medicines and improper food will cause stomach derange- 
ment for a certain time; some medicines completely upset the nor- 
mal condition, others stimulate the action of the enzymes, and still 
others cause inflammation of the stomach. Some physicians say, 
then, it is a very probable conclusion that preservatives will irritate 
the stomach, and this argument above all others is made to do duty 
as a strong reason why these chemicals should not be permitted in 
foods. There are a number of cases on record where persons have 
purposely taken various quantities of one preservative or another 
in daily doses, and we have very favorable testimony to the effect 
that no evil results followed, although in many cases abnormal 
amounts were taken. When abnormal quantities of salicylic acid 
are taken the warning is sounded by a ringing or buzzing sensation 
in the ears, similar to the eff'ects felt after taking quinine in large 
doses. It IS a remarkable fact that no discomfort has been felt from 
taking stated quantities of salicylic acid below the amount which 
will cause a ringing sensation in the ears. 



260 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

Diligent search has been made for the names of any persons 
who would give evidence that they had experienced any ill effects 
from stated doses of salicylic acid under the amount that will cause 
the ringing sensation or fullness in the head. No such amount of 
this preservative is ever used in food products. There are only 
three or four products which require more than i.iooo of any pre- 
servative, and this amount is very small in proportion to the full 
meal. Such condiments as require a preservative are used only 
sparingly at meal time; as a rule they are used to improve other 
food or make it more palatable. No one would make an entire m^l

Plate 71. Six Guiaea Piga and Tno Rabbits. 

of tomato catsup or chili-sauce ; only a small quantity is taken on 
cold meat, on oysters or in soup. Very few persons would use 
these condiments at more than one, possibly two meals per day, con- 
sequently the amount of such preservative as is used to keep them 
in an unfermented condition would be very small indeed. 

We have heard several authorities say that if preservatives 
were used only in such food as we have specified there would pos- 
sibly be very little objection to them, but the claim is made that per- 
haps nearly all the prepared food of various kinds contained pre- 



PRBSE3RVATIVB8. 251 

servatives, and in such amounts would prove dangerous and poison- 
ous to the human organism; also that if preservatives were per- 
mitted in one kind of food it would be difficult to draw the line and 
prevent their employment in all foods. Then the argument fol- 
lows that in such amounts they would injure the mucous membrane 
of the stomach and other internal organs. 

It is easy to assume that certain effects will follow certain 
causes, but it is a very difficult matter to disprove the assumption, 
so when a large number of physicians assert positively that the n(iuc- 
ous membrane of the stomach will be injured by salicylic acid in 
the amounts ordinarily used in food products, the amount of work 
required to overthrow such an assumption is large, and the technique 
employed in conducting the experiments is difficult, requiring special 
skill and a thorough knowledge of pathology. To this end a series 
of experiments were conducted with animals, and Dr. W. H. In- 
gram, professor of pathology in the West Penn Medical College, 
and Dr. R. G. Burns, pathologist and bacteriologist for the City of 
Allegheny, Pa., undertook the pathological part of the work. A 
number of guinea pigs were fed a weighed amount of salicylic acid 
daily. The acid used was the synthetical product, that which has 
been used so extensively in food. 7J^ milligrams of the acid were 
mixed in a breakfast cereal with milk, which amount was fed daily 
to each pig. This amount was found too large because the ani- 
mals would not eat it unless forced to do so by hunger, so the 
amount was cut down to 5 milligrams. The only food taken by 
the pigs outside of the prescribed diet was grass, which' was fed to 
them liberally. Comparing the weight of a guinea pig with that 
of an average man, which is as i to 100 or i to 150, the same pro- 
portion of acid would be from 7J4 to 10 grains daily for a man, and 
this amount of preservative would be sufficient to inhibit the growth 
of micro-organisms in 16 to 24 ounces of solid food in proportion of 
1 to 1000. This amount of preservative is far in excess of the 
amount taken in food daily by any person, but it represents an ex- 
treme case, but nevertheless one which might be possible. It is 
possible that in rare cases a person might consume such a quantity 
of certain foods and drinks that he would take as much as to grains 
or more in a single day, but this would not be continued daily. 
Physicians prescribe sodium salicylate in 30 grain doses three times 
daily for rheumatism. In this there would be about 22 grains of 
pure salicylic acid in each dose, consequently 60 grains daily for a 
limited time would not endanger a person. Therefore, if any per- 
son should happen to take more than 10 grains at a single meal or 
in one day, he would not suffer any special inconvenience. 

We are certain that the experiment conducted with the guinea 
pigs on a basis of 5 milligrams of salicylic acid daily is sufficiently 
broad to cover all cases. 



252 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

The experiments were conducted with guinea pigs in prefer- 
ence to any other animals for several reasons. There are no ani- 
mals which live on a diet exactly the same as a human, and in select- 
ing animals we must not select any such as the dog or cat which eat 
food partially decomposed, because the stomachs of such animals 
are not as sensative to poisons as the human. The stomach of the 
guinea pig is sensitive to poisons and cannot tolerate certain foods. 
Even milk is not properly digested unless mixed with cereal. An- 
other reason for selecting guinea pigs is that they are herbivorous. 
They are accustomed to a vegetable diet, and since nearly all the 
food products, in which a preservative is used are made from fruits 
and vegetable, these animals seem to be well suited for the experi- 
ments. They are cheap, easily handled and are not very large, so 
that everv advantasfe mav be claimed for their selection. 

The first series includes two pigs fed on 5 milligrams of salicy- 
lic acid mixed with cereal daily, and one pig fed just the same 
amount of cereal, but no acid (this one was used as a control). By 
having controls we are able to determine any physiological differ- 
ences, and the post mortem comparisons are quite valuable and nec- 
essary. 

When these experiments were begun the pigs were not full 
grown and none of them showed any signs of pregnancy. One of 
this series was a female and pregnant, which became apparent 
toward the end of the period from the increased weight and shape 
of the animal, but it was decided to learn if any pathological changes 
could be found in such cases, therefore she was submitted for an- 
alysis.

The weights of these three guinea-pigs were taken every other 
day, the results of which are here appended in a table.

was not regained until five days later. This decrease in weight was 
true of the control as well as of the others, indicating that the salicy- 
lic acid was not the cause. In the thirty days guinea-pig No. ( i ) 
had gained 5J/^ ounces; No. (2) had gained 5 ounces; No. (3) the 
control, gained only 334 ounces in the 24 days. 

All three animals were then given to Dr. W. H. Ingram for 
pathological examination. He is an eminent authority on pathology 
and the following is his report :

HI. MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION. 

I. Technique. 

The organs from these animals were placed in 4 per cent solu- 
tion of Formaldehyde for fixation. This step was completed while 
the parts were still warm. The stomach and intestines were spread 
out flat. Other solid organs were cut into slices about 2 m. m. thick. 
After remaining in this fixing fluid for about 40 hours, they were 
placed in running water for 24 hours, and then in 80 per cent alco- 
hol for preservation. 



PRE33EaVATIVES. 265 

Parts of each solid organ, measuring 2 c, ni, long by I c. m. 
wide and i m. m. thick were then placed in alcohols of 90 per cent, 
95 per cent and "100 per cent" ("absolute alcohol," 99.8 per cent 
— Squibb) for 24 hours for each per cent. The wall of the stomach 
was cut in sections having about the same surface area, and includ- 
ing all the coats. The sections of the stomach were placed in the 
ascending alcohols with those from the solid organs. 

From the alcohols they were immersed in a mixture of equal 
parts of 99.8 per cent alcohol and ether for a period of 24 hours. 

The imbedding was in celloidin. Two solutions were used. 
One, thin celloidin, in which the sections remained 48 hours, and the 



second, thick celloidin (practically a saturated solution in alcohol 
and ether), in which they remained 48 hours. They were next 
placed in "wood fiber" blocks, hardene{l for 24 hours in 80 per cent 
alcohol, and cut on a "Minot Perusian Microtome," 2 to 3-micra 
thick. 

Staining was produced by the Hematoxyln and Eosine method, 
and sections were mounted in Balsam. 

All sections stained easily, with sharp differentiation.

Mucosa. ( I ) ■ Surface epithelium — Does not show any 
pathological changes. Nuclei are sharply stained and normal in 
size and position. Cell protoplasm does not show any evidence of 
degenerative changes, staining evenly. 



(2) Glands — These are normal in shape and arrangement. 
No changes can be seen in the lumen or the cells forming the gland. 

The central cells show no changes, staining evenly. In the cardiac 
giands the Parietal Cells are very sharply defined, nuclei staining 
evenly, and the protoplasm showing no evidences of degeneration. 
The interglandular connective tissue does not show any tendency 
to leukocytic or round cell infiltration, nor does it show any other 
evidence of either hyperplasia or inflammation. The vessels of the 
mucosa are normal. The lenticular glands are also normal. 

Xo changes either of an inflammatory or degenerative char- 
acter can be seen in the other coats.

Both kidneys were examined. The malpighian bodies do not 
show, either in the capsule of Bowman, nor in the glomerulus, and 
evidences either of an inflammatory or degenerative character. The 
same may be also said of the tubule, from the neck to the termina- 
tion. The lumen of the tubule is at no place filled with unnatural 
products. 

The interstitial connective tissue is also normal. Blood ves- 
sels show no changes of any type, 

5. Suprarenals. (Section G. P. 532.) 

This shows no evidence of any pathological character either in 
the capsule, connective tissue, cortex or medullae. 

6. Pancreas. (Section G. P. 529.) 



PRESERVATIVES. 269 

This organ is also normal. The bodies of Langerhaus do not 
show any evidences of pathological processes. The cells of the 
glands stain clearly, evenly and are of normal size and shape. Vari- 
ous sections show the same normal character, 

I. Placenta and Uterus. (Section G. P. 530.) 
Examination shows a normal placenta. The uterine wall, as 
well as the placental attachment, show no disease conditions what- 
ever. 

II. Pig No. 2— 

This pig shows characters in no way differing excepting those 
of sex from those described. Taking the organs in the same order 
they show the following : 



1. Stomach. (Sections 536 and 537.) 

Surface epithelium normal, nuclei and protoplasm staining 
evenly and typically. 

The glands do not present any aherations in shape or position. 
The "central" and "parietal" cells staining in characteristic manner. 

The "lenticular glands" present same characters as those of 
stomach of Pig No, i. 

There are no evidences of any pathological changes in the in- 
terstitial connective tissue. 

The same may be siid of the remaining coaC; of this organ. 

2. Spleen. (Section G. P. 539.)

PRESERVATIVES. 261 

Malpighian bodies normal in size and number. No alterations 
in the walls of the blood vessels. Capsule and trabeculae show no 
evidences of inflammatory or degenerative changes. 

3. Heart. (Section G. P. 533.) . 
(i) Endocardium normal. 

(2) Myocardium, shows no changes either in the vessels, 
muscle fibers nor the interstitial connective tissues. 

(3) Pericardium, same as the endocardium. 

4. Kidneys. (Section G. P. 537.) . 

These organs present characters similar to those of Pig No. I. 
The Malpighian bodies, tubules, interstitial connective tissues and 
vessels are normal. 

5. Suprarenals. (Section G. P. 538.) 

Both these organs are normal, presenting no evidences of dis- 
ease. 

6. Pancreas. (Section G. P. 540.) 

This presents no character diflfering from that of Pig No i, 
being normal. 

Pig No. 3. Control. 

All organs of this animal were examined, but as it was a nor- 
mal, healthy animal, they presented no characters of interest in this 
connection. By comparing organs from this animal with those of 
No. I and No. 2, no diflferences could be seen, either in structure or 
staining reactions. 

CONCLUSION. 

The conclusion to be drawn from these sections, after careful 
comparisons, would be that all three animals were in a healthy con- 
dition, and that whatever diets may have been administered, they 
had no effect on the various organs, so far as any structural altera- 
tions were concerned. I could not detect any evidence, either of a 
degenerative, inflammatory, necrotic or hyperplastic process.

SERIES NO. II. 

The second series of experiments to determine the effect of 
preservatives on animals was begun on- May 14. Three guinea pigs 
were fed 5 milligrams of salicylic acid daily. The preservative was 
mixed with a well-known breakfast cereal. Two were fed with 5 
milligrams of benzoate of sodium daily, and other animals were fed 
the same food as these, but no preservatives. These were controls. 

There were three females in the series and we did not know in 
the beginning that they were pregnant, but as they increased in 
weight so rapidly, it became apparent ; therefore, on June 1 1 we dis-

continued taking the weights of these three. June 17-23 and 25 
were celebrated by the birth of the young ones. On July we again 
began taking the weights as before. This we continued to do until 
July 18, when the five animals were submitted for pathological and 
histological analysis. 

CONDITIONS NOTED DURING FEfiDING. 

As Stated it was not known that the three females were preg- 
nant at the beginning of this experiment, biit it was decided after 
finding out the fact, that it was just as well to go through the ex- 



periments under natural conditions. The very fact that the three 
females gave birth to young ones within the term is interesting. 
The young pigs were immediately given adult doses of preserva- 
tives as soon as they were able to take food themselves, and the 
next series will show the result. During the term there was no 
sign of sickness on the part of these animals; all seemed active, 
particularly the two males. These were quite vicious. One day 
we had a terrible rain storm which flooded the quarters where these 
animals were kept and fed, and rather expected that they might 
show some signs of sickness, but they did not. This would seem 
to indicate that the preservatives given had no weakening effect. 
The report of Dr. Ingram here appended is very satisfactory.

The same technique was employed as in Series i. 

SERIES NO. 3. 

The third series of experiments was conducted with animals 
which were fed on preservatives from the time they were able to 
take food themselves — from babyhood up to maturity. Two of 
these were fed 5 milligrams of salicylic acid daily, and two were 
fed 5 milligrams of benzoate of sodium daily. During the whole 
course of feeding, they showed no signs of sickness, but on the 
contrarj', seemed more active and healthy than the controls, bom 
about the same time. 



Considering the age and size of these guinea pigs, and the 
amount of the preservatives fed to them, we regard this as a crucial 
test, and from a therapeutical standpoint, might be sufficient evi- 
dence that these preservatives are harmless. Three of these animals 
were born on July 15. their mother being the fourth animal in 
Series No. 2. The other one was born on July 23, its mother be- 
ing the third animal in Series No. 2. Just one week after these 
baby pigs were born, they were put on the p^eser^■ati^■e diet, in the 
same proportions as were administered to the full grown animals 
in the other series. 

On September i we took them to the laboratory for pathologi- 
cal and histological analysis. 

A study of the table will show that all of these little pigs gained 
steadily in weight, if anything they gained more in proportion than 
the other young: ones born about the same time, and which were not 
fed on any preservatives. The following is Dr. Ingram's report:

CONCLUSION. 

The technique being the same in these three series, a uniform 
result was thus obtained. From these analyses of this series, the 
same conclusion must be arrived at as in the series Xo. (i) and (2), 
that is, that the conditions these guinea pigs were subject to, had 
no effect, so far as producing lesions of any organs, appreciable by 
pathological methods. 

W. H. Ingram. 



SERIES (4). RESULT FROM FEEDING RABBITS ON PRESERVATIVES. 

It has been stated by famous pharmacologists, that it is good 
therapeutics to base an opinion as to the effects of a drug on the re- 
sults obtained by feeding in stated quantities to animals. If there 
were no physiological ill effects noticed and if the internal organs 
showed no hyperplastic, pathological or degenerative changes, it 
was a fair assumption that the drug would have no harmful or in- 
jurious effect upon the human organism. This is indeed the meth- 
od employed to determine the character of all known substances, 
particularly at the time they are first discovered. 

We have completed the fourth series of such experiment with 
salicylic and benzoic acids and this series has some interesting fea- 
tures. On May 14 we received several very young rabbits along 
with our guinea pigs, and selected two for experimental purposes. 
These appeared in the photograph published in the May issue of 
the "Index" and are reprinted here. 

The young rabbits which we intended for controls did not get 
along well and soon died, but the two kept for the experiment grew 
rapidly and were never sick a single day during the whole term of 
feeding. They were always active and playful and we became so 
much attached to them that we disliked to kill them for the patho- 
logical analysis. During the months of August and September we 
gave the 5 milligrams of benzoate of sodium daily, in addition to 
their daily dose of 5 milligrams of salicylic acid. They seemed to 
relish their food very much and would always come running to us 
every time we approached their cage. They were always hungry 
and I believe we might have given them double the quantity of pre- 
servatives without injuring them in the least. During the term 
of feeding they never seemed drowsy and I often wondered when 
they obtained enough sleep, for on moonlight nights I could see 
them running around very lively. 

On May 14 the white bunny weighed ii>^ ounces and the 
grey weighed 7^ ounces — they were mere babies. From that 
date upto August i we fed them 5 milligrams of salicylic acid

daily and they weighed at that time 35 aiid 34 ounces respectively. 
After that we administered tlie two preservatives as previously men- 
tioned and at the end of tlie term they weighed 49,'- j and 43 ounces 
respectively. They were then killed for pathological and histological 
analyses by Doctor R. G. Bums, a noted pathologist, and the bac- 
teriologist for the city of Allegheny. Pa. The following is his re- 
port:

282 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

Dr. Burns was not present at any time during the feeding term 
of these animals atid was not familiar with the preservative experi- 
ment and did not know on what diets the animab had been fed, 
therefore his analyses are entirely independent of the feeding, 
an<l he was not influenced by any kno_\vledge of tJie facts and his 
results as are reported jnst as he found them. 

We examined the slides carefully under various magnifying 
powers and here append our findings. 

Slide of the slomach of white rabbit. — The stomach wall in- 
chiding the mucosa, submucosa, muscularis, and serosa, appeared

perfect in every respect; tliere were no lesions or anything that 
would indicate injury. The fundus glands were stained perfectly, 
showing the parietal cells with nuclei clearly stained; the smooth 
muscle cells and the chief cells seemed to be properly arranged. 
The pyloric glands were norma! in size and position; the epithelium 
of the surface, the tunica propria, solitary follicles were all normal. 
The slide of the gray rabbit's stomach presented no different ap- 
pearance. 

Slide of the kidneys from the ^chtte rabbit. — These sections suf- 
fered somewhat in mounting. The glomeruli were somewhat dis- 
arranged, but there were no disease processes. The convoluted tub- 



PRESERVATIVES. 283 

ules and their cells were all normal, likewise Bowman's capsules. 
The cells in the glomeruli were all distinctly stained w-ith the nuclei 
standing out prominently. The blood vessels and urinary tubules 
were normal in appearance. The ascending and descending arms 
of Henle's loops are plainly visible, and are normal in appearance. 
The convoluted tubules of the first order are normal in size, number 
and position. The general appearance of the kidney consisting of 
the tunica albuginea, medullary rays, convoluted tubules both of the 
first and second order, cortex, medulla, veins and arteries was that 
of a healthy animal and showed no evidence of degenerative pro- 
cesses. 

The slide from the gray rabbit had no different appearance so 
far as we were able to determine. 

Since these two organs, viz.. the stomach and the kidneys, are 
the ones most likely to show the effects of any improper diets, we 
have not made any more extended microscopical examination of 
the other organs and simply refer the reader to Dr. Burns' report. 

The results obtained by the pathological analyses of the four 
series of animals are most gratifying. We are inclined to believe 
that all the professional opinions expressed as to the harmful effects 
of salicylic and benzoic acids in the amounts ordinarily employed 
as preservatives in food products are unwarranted by the facts. We 
certainly do not believe them and from what we have observed in 
these experiments we are inclined to take the other side. We have 
not been prejudiced, we have been seeking to learn tlie truth, and 
we have learned that some of the most respected professional men 
in this country have been expressing opinions concerning preserva- 
tives without making personal investigation. This is lamentable, 
because it casts a shadow on the integrity of the men who stand out 
so boldly as opponents of preservatives. Take for instance the 
statement by a well known champion of the opposition, **that be- 
cause preservatives are anti-ferments and therefore stop processes 
of decay, in just that proportion will they interfere with the fer- 
ments of digestion." Nothing could l)e farther from the truth, yet 
this same error and misconception is embodied in the very 
first resolution offered to the International Pure Food Congress by 
the committee on preservatives. It reads : "Whereas, etc., be it 
resolved (i). That this congress does not approve of the use of 
preservatives or antiseptics other than those above named (salt, 
sugar, vinegar and wood-smoke), which, to be effective, must de- 
stroy or paralyze all fermentative organisms. They induce a con- 
dition which must be more or less unfavorable to dieestion and thev 
are therefore to this extent hurtful." Thi-^ resolution is signed by 
the following persons : H. W. Wiley. T- H. Sliepard, V. L. Price, E. 
F. Ladd. Julius Hortyett, William Berkely and Richard Fischer. 



284 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

There is not a single particle of truth in this resolution. Every one 
of the substances mentioned as being non-injurious have fully as 
much harmful effect on digestion as the well known preservatives, 
salicylic and benzoic acids, weight for weight. Some of them will 
retard digestion more than these, vinegar and creosote from smoke, 
for example. Hydrochloric acid, one of the most powerful anti- 
ferments known, is absolutely essential to digestion — digestion by 
pepsin cannot proceed without hydrochloric acid ; how then can the 
resolution be true? Some of these men, as learned as they are in 
some directions, do not seem to know that fermentation accom- 
plished by bacteria, yeasts and molds is as much different from the 
digestive processes as ignorance is from knowledge. Just follow 
out such reasoning — if all anti-ferments exert an injurious effect 
on the digestive processes, how in the world are we going to elimin- 
ate the 0.2 per cent of hydrochloric acid which is poured into the 
stomach by the glands of the gastric mucous membrane? Because 
cranberries contain benzoic acid, shall we refrain from eating that 
delightful sauce with our turkey dinners, simply because a few radi- 
cals declare that it interferes with digestion? Any sensible and 
thinking person knows better than that : every one knows that cran- 
berry sauce assists digestion, and this sauce, as it is prepared for the 
table, contains benzoic acid in the proportion of i to 2,000 and more. 
Re\'erse the reasoning : arsenic is a dangerous and deadly poison to 
man ; it will absolutely stop all digestive processes in small doses, but 
poisonous as it is to mankind, it has very little effect on bacteria, and 
in the same proportion does not interfere at all with the putrefactive 
bacteria. The statisticians inform us thai the average length of life 
has increased FIVE YEARS within the last decade. To what 
cause can this felicitous improvement be traced? Some have at- 
tempted to answer this question by stating that the science of medi- 
cine has made wonderful strides aiid new remedies have been dis- 
covered. Some sav that there are better sanitarv conditions, and 
there are better methods of combating diseases by quarantine laws 
and regulations. Some say that we have better food since the 
fTerni theory has become better understood. Let us ask ourselves a 
few questions. 

What is the most frequent cause of death? Bacteria of dis- 
eases? 

What is the effect of newly discovered remedies? Do they de- 
strov bacteria ? 

Has the medical science advanced in proportion to the discov- 
ery of the bacteria which cause diseases, and the antiseptics used to 
combat them? 

Has the increased amount of chemically preserved food any- 
thing to do with the lessening of diseases? Why have they not 



PRESERVATIVES. 285 

shortened life as the opponents of food preservatives claim? Is it 
possible that preservatives might be the means of preventing the 
multiplication of disease bacteria in food ? 

Is it not possible that the increased longevity may be due di- 
rectly to the increased consumption of chemically preserved food ? 

Bacteria are the cause of most deaths, and the antiseptics are 
the means we have at hand for opposing them. Shall we not be 
very careful how we restrict their usefulness ? Is it not a possibility 
that the pure food experts are attempting to drive out of oiu* mar- 
kets the very best food ever prepared for the health and happiness of 
mankind? We merely ask the questions.

Chemical Antiseptics 

Benzoic Acid. — Method of Detection. — Salicylic Acid. — ^lethod of 
Detection. Formaldehyde. — Method of Detection. Boracic 
Acid. — Method of Detection. — Miquels Table of Antiseptics and 
Their Relative Value. 



Only a few chemicals have any very great antiseptic value and 
the number which is used commonly in preserving food is limited to 
three or four. Of course, there are various substances which have 
antiseptic value, such as sugar, salt and vinegar, but we have ref- 
ference only to chemicals which are prepared and sold to the trade 
for preserving purposes. These are benzoic acid, more commonly 
used in the form of benzoate of sodium; salicylic acid, boric acid 
and borax, and formaldehyde. 

Benzoic acid (CcHcCOg) is made from benzoin by sublima- 
tion. It is artificially prepared from tuluol and may be obtained 
from toluene (QHjjC), or naphthalin (CioHg) from hippuric acid. 

The English benzoic acid is prepared from certain varieties of 
Botany Bay gum (gum acroides), and is superior to the German 
product. The form usually employed as a preservative is benzoate 
of sodium (NCjH-O^) which is made by simply neutralizing ben- 
zoic acid with carbonate of soda. 

It is white and very light, with odor of benzoin, has a sweetish 
astringent taste ; it is soluble in twenty parts of water and forty-five 
parts of alcohol. It is used as a medicine for gout, rheumatism, 
Hthaemia and lithaemic gravel, puerperal fever and tuberculosis. 
As a preservative it is powerful in the proportion of i to 909 (Mi- 
quel), atid prevents the growth of molds, yeasts and nearly all bac- 
teria. It is employed largely in the manufacture of catsups, pulps, 
sauces, fruit butters, jams, preserves, meats, beer, wines, and in fact, 
practically takes the place of salicylic acid, which was prohibited by 
law in the years 1893 ^^d 1896 in the various states. The laws of 
many states do not permit the employment of this or any other anti- 
septic, but there is a disposition to be lenient with the manufactur- 
ers of tomato products pending the reports of the results of experi- 
ments now being made. There will therefore be no action taken 
against the use of benzoate of sodium in catsup. Chili-sauce, etc.. at 
present, unless the quantities used are in excess: i-iooo will prob- 



CHEMICAL ANTISEPTICS. 287 

ably be allowed until the department at Washington gets more in- 
formation on the effect of this chemical upon the human body. 

Owing to the fact that many manufacturers of food products 
purchase part of their preserved material which they use in special 
formulae, it is well for them to be acquainted with official tests em- 
ployed to ascertain what preservatives, if any, have been used. The 
manufacturer will be enabled to make these tests for himself if he 
observes closely each step in the analysis. 

DETKCTION OF BENZOIC ACID. 

Make a chloroform extract of the material to be examined. If 
liquid, make slightly alkaline with sodium hydroxid, and first strain 
through flannel, then acidify with 33 V^ per cent sulphuric acid, and 
add about 10 per cent of the bulk of chloroform or ether. 

If the material is of solid nature, dissolve by maceration with 
water, a little more than e(iual weight, and proceed as with liquid. 

After making chloroform extraction separate this from water 
by means of a separatory funnel. If the extract be clear, evaporate 
at a low temperature until a residue is formed. In the event of the 
solution not being clear, the result may be obtained by using the 
centrifugal machine (Fig. XI). Take up residue with a small 
quantity of hot water and make the following three tests for ben- 
zoic acid : 

First. Sublimation method (Leach). Evaporate an ammon- 
iacal solution of the ether extract to dryness in a large watch-glass 
by the aid of a gentle heat. Fasten with clips or otherwise a sec- 
ond watch-glass to the first, edge to edge, so as to form a double 
convex chamber with a cut filter paper between. Place upon a 
small sand-bath and heat. Benzoic acid, if present, w^ill sublime upon 
the surface of the upper glass in minute needles, recognizable under 
the microscope. It may further be tested by determining the melt- 
ing-point of the crystals, or by treating the residue with ammonia, 
and after evaporation and solution of the residue, applying the ferric 
chlorid test. 

Second Method. — Make a part of the extract distinctly alka- 
line with ammonium hydroxid : expel excess of ammonia by evapor- 
ation, take up the residue with small quantity of water and add a 
few drops of a neutral 0.5 per cent solution of ferric chlorid. The 
reaction will be a brown-colored precipitate of benzoate of iron, if 
benzoic acid be present. 

Third Method. — Evaporate a portion of the original extract 
and add a small quantity of chemically pure sulphuric acid, then 
heat until white fumes are given off. All the organic matter is 
charred and the benzoic acid is converted into sulpho-benzoic ^cid. 



288 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

To this add a few crystals of potassium nitrate, and there is formed 
meta-di-nitro-benzoic acid. 

This acid should be cooled and diluted with water, then add 
ammonia in excess, and then add a drop or two of ammonium sul- 
phid, which converts the nitrocompound into meta-di-amido-benzoic 
acid, which possesses a red color and shows immediately on the sur- 
face of the fluid without stirring. 

If any two of these methods give positive reactions it is safe to 
assume that benzoic acid is present. The methods given may seem 
on first reading to be slightly complicated, but they are really simple 
and can be used successfully by any one who exercises care. 

The chloroform and ether extraction of the suspected material 
will show in the final tests even small quantities of benzoic acid. 

SAUCYUC ACID. 

In 1834 salicylic acid was discovered by Pagensteecher in the 
flowers of Spiraea Ulmaria, in the form of salicyl aldehyde. This 
antiseptic is also found in the oil of wintergreen (Gaultheria pro- 
cumbens), sweet birch (Betula lenta) and other varieties of gaul- 
theria, also in various fruits and vegetable roots. It is obtained 
synthetically from carbolic acid or phenol. It has one more atom 
of oxygen than benzoic acid and its symbol is CjHcOs. It is also 
called ortho-oxybenzoic acid. Kolbe patented a process for obtain- 
ing it by treating sodium phenol with carbon dioxide gas. Equal 
parts were evaporated to powder, then heated to 212 degrees F., 
then a stream of CO2 was passed over it and temperature raised to 
365 degrees F., then to 428 degrees F., then to 482 degrees F., until 
phenol ceased to distill over the retort. One-half of the phenol re- 
mained and formed salicylate of sodiimi. P. W. Hofman patented 
a process by which all the phenol was converted into salicylic acid by 
using superheated steam in the distillation. 

Salicylic acid is a snowy white, very light material, comprised 
of four-sided prism, which crystallize from hot water in fine pris- 
matic needles. It has a sweetish taste and an acrid after taste. It 
is irritating to the nostrils, causing violent sneezing. It is soluble 
in 450 parts of Avater and 23/2 parts of alcohol. It is quite soluble 
in water containing 8 per cent of borax or 10 per cent of sodium 
phosphate. 

Salicylic acid is one of the beucyl compounds, of which there 
are five in common use. All have the peculiarities of the base 
benzyl. The other four are benzoic acid, benzaldehyde, salol and 
saccharin, the latter being intensely sweet and is sold under trade 
names as a substitute for sugar, to w^hich it has no chemical analog^'. 

Salicylic acid is antiseptic in parts i to 1,000 (Miquel), but ex- 
erts marked differences on various bacteria. Some common putre- 



CHEMICAL ANTISEPTICS. 289 

factive species remain unaffected in the presence of considerable 
quantities, while others perish, and this accounts for the losses often 
experienced when saHcylic acid was used largely as a preservative 
of table condiments of various kinds. This chemical came into fa- 
vor about 1880 and the quantities imported from Germany were 
enormous. There were considerable quantities manufactured in the 
United States, but the acid was inferior in antiseptic power to that 
of the imported. Up to 1894 it continued in favor and was used 
to preserve every kind of food subject to fermentation and putre- 
faction. Laws were rapidly passed prohibiting its employment as 
a food preservative, owing to the statements issued by several au- 
thorities that it was harmful and produced heart trouble or might 
cause death to persons having heart trouble, and so it was replaced 
by benzoic acid, neutralized by carbonate of sodium and sold as 
benzoate of sodium. 

Salicylic acid is combined with sodium for medicinal purposes 
and is a valuable remedy for disordered stomach, due to fermenta- 
tion, also for rheumatism, etc. It is easily detected by the official 
test when used only in small quantities. 

A chloroform or ethereal extract is made, the same as for the 
benzoic acid test, and the following tests are reliable : 

First Method. — Add two or three drops of ferric chlorid to a 
small quantity of the extract and let them come together slowly. 
The reaction is a purple or violet color. 

Second Method. — Evaporate 0.5CC. of the extract to dryness at 
a low temperature, and add one drop of nitric acid (C. P.), then 
make alkaline with a few drops of ammonia. Ammonium picrate is 
formed, having a yellow color, which may be used to dye a thread of 
clean wool. 

For a crude test the presence of salicylic acid in such food pro- 
-ducts as catsup, Chili-sauce, etc., may be determined by simply dilut- 
ing the material with water and using a few drops of ferric chlorid, 
which produces the purple or violet color. The simplicity of this 
test was a cause for the rapid discontinuance of salicylic acid as a 
preservative after the laws were passed prohibiting it in foodstuff. 

FORMALDEHYDE. 

Formaldehyde is a very powerful antiseptic which has lately 
come into use, especially as a preservative for milk and some other 
food substances, also as a disinfectant and deodorizing agent. For- 
maldehyde is symbolized CHgO, and is closely allied to formic acid, 
which acid results from oxidation. It was discovered in 1868 by 
Hofmann and was made by passing a mixture of air and methyl- 
alcohol (wood alcohol) vapor over heated platinum. It is prac- 
tically all obtained by the oxidation of methyl alcohol. This is ac- 



290 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

compHshed in "Formaldehyde Lamps," a platinum cone heated by 
electricity. It is a gas which is condensed to a colorless liquid at 21° 
C, and at a higher temperature is changed into paraformaldehyde, 
which is the commercial article sold for preserving purposes in 
40 per cent solutions. A 50 per cent solution is made, but is un- 
stable. 

The germicidal power of formaldehyde was discovered in 1888 
by Traillat, who patented a process for manufacturing it. The 
germicidal power is nearly equal to that of corrosive sublimate and 
is greater than that of carbolic acid. A i per cent aqueous solution 
kills all spores of pathogenic bacteria in one hour. It decolorizes 
organic matter, precipitating extracts and colors. 

It is a strong irritant when inhaled and affects the mucous 
membrane of the mouth and throat and inflames the nasal passages ; 
the gas also irritates the eyes and causes them to smart and water. 
It passes through the body when taken in food and the urine does 
not ferment ; it will deodorize faeces or putrefactive products ; it is 
an excellent disinfectant and may be heated over a lamp to generate 
gas for disinfecting rooms after cases of contagious and infectious 
diseases; it has been used to embalm bodies and gives firmness to 
the flesh. 

It does not exert a very great germicidal power over molds and 
yeasts and for this reason was a failure as a substitute for salicylic 
acid as a preservative for tomato products, such as catsup, Chili- 
sauce, chutney, etc. It has entered into the composition of various 
"trade preservatives*' and has thus been the cause of considerable 
trouble which manufacturers have had with food commissioners. 
The manufacturers have been purchasing various antiseptics under 
trade names designated by numbers, which are either simple or 
complex antiseptic chemicals, and are put up and sold under dis- 
guised names at four to ten times their actual value. Many of these 
contain formaldehyde, benzoic acid, boric acid and sometimes sa- 
licylic acid and oftentimes other well-known chemicals which have 
only very mild antiseptic power. 

Formaldehyde is probably injurious when used to any very 
great extent in foods. Owing to its peculiar nature it hardens cel- 
lular and albuminous matter and should not be used as a preserva- 
tive for meats, fish and many vegetables, but it seems to preserve 
milk I to 15,000 for a few days without any serious chemical 
changes. 

The prevalence of this chemical in nature is remarkable, al- 
though the amount usually present in various plants and manufac- 
tured foods is perhaps small. It is present in many of the growing 
plants ; it is a product of vital action of bacteria on vegetable mat- 
ter ; it is found frequently in fresh milk and nearly always in milk 



CHEMICAL ANTISEPTICS. 291 

which has stood exposed to the action of bacteria. Some vegeta- 
bles, such as peas, beans, asparagus, sugar corn, etc., when allowed 
to stand exposed to the air before canning, will give the chemical 
reaction for formaldehyde. 

Many vegetables and meats, when processed in steam retorts 
at 250° F., show the presence of formaldehyde by the official test. 
At this place I wish to state that any person who has made careful 
analyses for formaldehyde in nature will be able to judge whether 
the reaction is due to an added chemical or merely a natural forma- 
tion. While there is no reliable official quantitative analysis, yet the 
analyst should be able to tell by the strength of the reaction whether 
formaldehyde has been purposely added as a preservative or whether 
it is there naturally or as a result of oxidation. 

There are some substances which give reactions so closely re- 
sembling those of formaldehyde that the analyst must be extremely 
careful in forming conclusions. It is a lamentable fact that some 
of our agricultural chemists have fallen victims to both of the wrong 
conclusions cited. It has been suggested that perhaps the raw ma- 
terial purchased from other houses probably contained formalde- 
hyde or some other antiseptic, and the food manufacturer, while in- 
nocent of adding this preservative himself, has unconsciously been 
guilty of statute violation ; so we w'ill give the official test for for- 
maldehyde to enable him to make analyses of all raw material used 
to make up a given product. 

CHEMICAL ANALYSIS FOR l^ORMALDEHYDE. (w. M. ALLEN.) 

In case the suspected material is solid or semi-solid, macerate 
from 200 to 300 grams with 100 c. c. of water to obtain sufficient 
fluidity. Make this preparation distinctly acid with phosphoric acid 
and fill into flask of 500 to 800 c. c. capacity. A copper flask may be 
heated directly over flames but a glass flask is better heated in a 
linseed oil bath. Connect flask with glass condenser and distill off 
about 40 or 50 c. c. 

If the suspected material is a liquid acidify as before and pro- 
cess as directed under benzoic acid to obtain a chloroform or ether 
extract, which is distilled in oil bath at 250 to 260 degrees F. 

METHOD NO. I. 

To about 5 c. c. of the distillate add two or three drops of a i 
per cent aqueous solution phenol ; mix and carefully pour it on about 
the same amount of sulphuric acid in a test tube, holding tube so 
that the solutions will not mix. The presence of one part of formal- 
dehyde in 100,000 parts is indicated by the formation of a crimson 
color at the place of union of the solutions. If formaldehyde be 



292 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

present in greater quantity a white turbidity or a light-colored pre- 
cipitation will be formed above the coloring. 

If organic matter is distilled over the charring of it by the sul- 
phuric acid may be mistaken for a trace of formaldehyde, but on 
allowing the test to stand for twelve hours the coloration due to 
the formaldehyde will become a whitish turbidity instead of the dark 
color which appears if due to the charring of organic matter. 

Note. — Some other aldehydes will give the same result and it 
is not therefore conclusive. 

METHOD NO. 2. 

Add about 5 c. c. of the distillate obtained originally to an 
equal volume of pure milk in a casserole, also 10 c. c. of muriatic 
acid (C. P.) containing i c. c. of a 10 per cent solution of ferric 
chlorid solution to each 500 c. c. of acid. Heat to 80° or 90^ di- 
rectly over flame, giving casserole a rotary motion to break up the 
curd of the milk. A violet color may indicate formaldehyde. 

METHOD NO. 3. 

Dissolve I gram of phenylhydrazin hydrochlorid and ij4 
grams acetate of sodium in 10 c. c. of water. To i c. c. of distil- 
late obtained originally add 2 drops of reagent and 2 drops of sul- 
phuric acid. A green color indicates the presence of formaldehyde, 

BORACIC ACID OR BORIC ACID. 

Boric acid is a preservative used for milk, meats and veget- 
ables. Various preparations of boric acid or borates are sold under 
trade names as food preservatives. A mixture of boric acid 
and borax was sold under the name of **Rex Magnus;*' another 
mixture of boric acid and glycerol is sold under the name of "Boro- 
glycerid.'' 

Boric acid is symbolized as H3BO3 and is obtained by the inter- 
action of sulphuric acid (H2SO4), and borax (Na2B407), also by 
the purification of native boric acid, found in combinations as a mag- 
nesium salt in sea water, mineral waters, such as Vichy, Wiesbaden 
and Aix-la-Chapel ; also in mineral substances, as boro-calcite in the 
niter beds of Chili ; also in natural borax or tincal in the dried-up 
lagoons in central Asia ; in large ([uantities in Clear Lake, Califor- 
nia. It is found in ulexite (sodium and calcium borate) and cole- 
manite (calcium borate), also found in a large vein deposit, prob- 
ably of volcanic origin in San Bernardino County, California, which 
yields about twenty-five million pounds annually. 

Boric acid occurs as pearly scales soluble in water and alcohol, 
has a feeble acid reaction and possesses a bitter taste. It changes

to metaboric acid (HBO2) when heated to 250° F. and may be 
changed by further heating to its anhydrid, B2O3. 

^\s an antiseptic it has very Httle vahie and has, I think, been 
very much over-estimated, although it is used with fair success for 
preserving milk. When combined with other salts it seems to re- 
tard putrefaction in meats, sausages, butter and milk. It is never 
used in sufficient quantities to be germicidal, hence pathogenic bac- 
teria, such as typhoid, anthrax, hog cholera, tuberculosis, etc., will 
remain alive, though dormant, in meats lightly cured and in butter 
made from infected cream. 

Much of our exported meat, butter and other foodstuff is par- 
tially preserved with boric acid, and this seems to be necessary for 
countries which are not advanced in refrigerating methods. Our 
manufacturers use large quantities, therefore, in expert goods to 
prevent reclamations on account of spoilage. This is not so neces- 
sary in our country, because we have means of preserving such 
foods in refrigerators or cold storage. 

As a preservative for catsup. Chili-sauce, chutney, jams, jellies, 
preserves, etc., boric acid has very little value. When Barff dis- 
covered "boro-glycerid" in 1886 it was hoped that it might 6e a 
valuable harmless antiseptic for tomato products, but the tests did 
not give satisfaction. 

Boric acid is antiseptic in i part to 300. 

OFFICIAL CHEMICAL TEST FOR BORIC ACID. — NO. I, QUALITATIVE 

ANALYSIS. 

Render decidedly alkaline with lime water about 25 grams of 
the sample evaporate to dryness on a water bath. Ignite the resi- 
due to destroy organic matter. Add about 15 c. c. of water and 
hydrochloric acid, drop by drop, to acid reaction. Then add about 
I c. c. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. Moisten a piece of deli- 
cate tumeric paper with the solution ; if borax or boric acid is pres- 
ent the paper on drying will acquire a peculiar red color, which is 
changed by ammonia to a dark blue-green, but is restored by acid. 
This color is almost unmistakable, but it is best for one not familiar 
with it to conduct a test where boric acid is known to be present. 

NO. 2. — QUALITATIVE ANALYSTS. (OFFICIAL.) 

Add an equal drop of fresh saturated tumeric tincture and a 
drop of hydrochloric acid and heat for a few seconds. 

If the suspected material be a liquid, evaporate with the tumeric 
and heat with a drop of diluted hydrochloric acid for a few seconds ; 
then if borax or boric acid be present a pink or dark red color will 
appear, depending upon the quantity present. Cool and add a drop 
of ammonium hydroxid, when a dark blue-green color will appear.

miquel's table of antiseptics. 

Miquel made tests of a large number of substances to ascertain 
their antiseptic value, many are powerful poisons for man as well as 
bacteria. There are quite a number whose action on the human 
organism are not positively known, and there are quite a number 
which have only very slight antiseptic power. The most common 
powerful antiseptic and disinfectant in general use for destroying 
bacteria on instrument, furniture, and various materials, which do 
not come in contact with food, is mercuric chlorid. or corrosive sub- 
limate. This is used largely in our laboratories for destroying cul- 
tures of bacteria, or for disinfecting purposes. We give Miquel's 
table of antiseptics and their proportions which prove effective.

A careful study of this table shows that the antiseptics usually 
employed in foodstuff are equally effective with some of the most 
powerful mineral poisons known. Miquel places hydrogen perox- 
id as third in the list of antiseptics eminently powerful. If this 



296 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

preparation were stable it could be used almost ad libitum, because 
it is not poisonous, but it loses its properties rapidly and soon de- 
composes into water by giving up one atom of oxygen, thus HjOj — 
O = H2O. 

From our experience with this substance we are inclined to 
think that Miquel overestimated its value as an antiseptic. It does 
not prove effective as a food preservative. Nearly all my experi- 
ments have failed, even when the proportion used was 1-1,000. 
This may be due to its unstable nature, and cannot therefore be 
satisfactory.

SACCHARIN. 



Saccharin is the commercial name for Glusidum, or, according 
to the British, the drug name is given as Gluside; the chemical 
name is benzoyl sulphonimide, which gives some clue to its base ori- 
gin. It is a sweet imide, from toluene, and is S}TTibolized as CyHg. 
NSO3. It is obtained by first converting toluene into sulphamide, 
which by oxidation yields the imide. It forms a white powder 
which melts 392° F., with partial decomposition, evolving the 
odor of bitter almonds. It is soluble in \A^ter, from which it may 
be crystallized in alcohol, ether, glycerin and .clucose. Saccharin 
may be detected in solutions containing sugar, by extracting with 
ether, then evaporating and fusing the residue, which will melt at 
about 392° F., and if fused with nitre and carbonate of sodium, will 
show sulphuric acid. The weight of BaS04 obtained in this way 
from 100 grams of sugar multiplied by 0.785 will give weight of 
saccharin extracted. 

Saccharin occurs as a white powder composed of irregular 
crystals only slightly soluble in water, readily soluble in glycerine, 
alcohol and ether. The aqueous solution has a distinct acid reac- 
tion and forms salts. 

The commercial saccharin contains para-sulphamine-benzoic 
acid, from which impurity it may be freed by recrystallization, ace- 
tone being used as the solvent. The difiference in the melting point 
between saccharin and para-sulphamine-benzoic acid is also used 
for distinguishing them. The pure chemical saccharin melts at 
286.5° F- while the other melts at 224.5° F. 

Saccharin is very soluble in weak solution of ammonia, also in 
bicarbonate of sodium. 

Saccharin has no properties of sugar except sweetness; it has 
no food value, and passes unchanged through the kidneys, and w^ill 
prevent to some extent ammoniacal fermentation of the urine. 

As an antiseptic it has very little value, and is not used in food 
products for preserving or preventing fermentation. Wherever it 



298 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

is used, the object is to take the place of sugar. It is generally re- 
garded by Pure Food Authorities as an adulterant, and this is one 
construction that can be put upon its employment in food products. 
That it is used in large quantities for sweetening glucose, syrups, 
preserves, jams, jellies and canned goods, such as com and 
peas, cannot be denied. The consumers in all cases, no doubt, be- 
lieve that their goods owe their sweetness to sugar, and are thus 
deceived and are deprived of the food which they believe they are 
purchasing, sugar being a food and saccharin having no food value. 
There are large quantities of syrups almost worthless as such, which 
are sweetened with saccharin and sold at fair prices, the consum- 
ers believing same to be the product of cane sugar. 

There are many authors quoted on each side of the question, 
*'Is saccharin injurious to the human organism?" and it is not with- 
in the province of this work to enter into the discussion, but we 
believe that the preponderance of evidence is unfavorable to its em- 
ployment as a sweetener of food products. Among the authorities 
who write against it, might be quoted Dr. Wiley, Chief Chemist of 
the United States, Thomson, Sollman, Dr. Butler, Dr. C. H. Wood 
and Paul. These authorities claim that '^Saccharin checks the 
action of ptyalin, pepsin, trypsin and other allied ferments,'* that 
it increases the amount of chlorides excreted from the urin," that 
it has no food value; it is an antiseptic; it prevents decay, and 
therefore retards digestion to that extent." It is believed by some 
that its long continued use may give rise to nephritis. 

From the knowledge that we possess, viz., its employment as a 
substitute for cane sugar, and the possible injurious effects which 
it may have upon the human organism, it seems wise that every 
packer of foodstuff eliminate saccharin and make every effort to ele- 
vate the standard of their goods by using only cane sugar as a 
sweetener. 

There are several tests which are used to determine the pres- 
ence of saccharin, and the packers who use syrups in their formu- 
las may determine its presence as follows : 

If the sample to be tested is a solution or syrup, render it acid, 
if not already such, with phosphoric acid, and extract with ether. 
In case of canned vegetables and similar goods, finely divide the 
material by pulping or maceration in a mortar, dilute w-ith water, 
and strain through muslin. Acidify the filtrate, and extract with 
ether. If an emulsion forms, use a centrifugal machine. Separ- 
ate the extract, evaporate off the ether, and test the residue for sac- 
charin as follows: 

(i) Add to the residue, if it tastes sweet, a few cubic centi- 
meters of hot water, or preferably a very dilute solution of sodium 
carbonate, in which saccharin is more soluble. An intenselv sweet 






ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS AND ADULTEIRANTS. 299 

taste is indicative of its presence. This test, if applied directly, will 
sometimes fail, especially in the case of beer, by reason of the extrac- 
tion of ether of various bitter principles, such as hop resins, which 
by their strong, bitter taste mask the sweet taste of saccharin in 
die residue. Speath recommends that such bitter substances be re- 
moved before extraction, which is done by treatment of 500 c. c. 
of the beer with a few crystals of copper nitrate, or with a solution 
of copper sulphate. The floccnlent precipitate formed need not be 
filtered off, but the liquid is preferably concentrated by evaporation 
to syrupy consistency, acidified with phosphoric acid, and extracted 
with three successive portions of a mixture of ether and petroleum 
-ether. After extraction, separation, and evaporation of the sol- 
vent, dissolve the residue in weak sodium carbonate. As small a 
quantity as o.ooi per cent of saccharin can be detected in the final 
alkaline solution bv its sweet taste. 

(2) Bornstein's Test. — Heat the residue from the ether extrac- 
tion of the acidified sample with resorcin and a few drops of sul- 
phuric acid in a test tube till it begins to swell up. Remove from 
the flame, and, after cooling till the action quiets down, again heat, 
repeating the heating and cooling several times. Finally cool, di- 
lute with water, and neutralize with sodium hvdroxid. A red- 
green fluorescence indicates saccharin. Gantter states that it is 
useless to apply this test to beer, in view of the fact that ordinary 
hop resin gives the same fluorescence. 

(3) Schmidt's Test. — The residue is heated in a porcelain dish 
with about a gram of sodium hvdroxid for half an hour at a tem- 
perature of 250^ C, either in aa air-oven or in a linseed oil bath. 
This converts the saccharin if present into sodium salicylite. Dis- 
solve the fused mass in water, acidify, and extract the solution with 
ether. Test the ether residue in the rcsfular manner for salicylic 
acid with ferric chlorid. This test can obviously be applied only in 
the absence of salicvlic acid, which should first be directlv tested for. 

DULCIN. 

This white powder is composed of needle-like crystals, slightly 
soluble in cold water, ether and chloroform. Its symbol is C9HJ2N2 
O2. It is soluble in 800 parts of cold water, 50 parts of boiling 
water, and 25 parts of 95 per cent alcohol. It is soluble in acetic 
ether. Dulcin is about four hundred times as sweet as cane sugar. 

When dulcin is combined with N/io sodium hvdroxid and sub- 
jected to distillation, a substance called phenetidin is formed which 
volatilizes and passes into the distillate. This, when heated with 
glacial acetic acid, forms phenacetin. Phenacetin is detected by 
first boiling with hydrochloric acid, diluting with water, cooling the 
filtrate, and adding a few drops of chromic acid solution. A deep 
red color is formed. 



300 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

DETECTION OF DULCIN. 

(i) Bellier's Method. — A portion of the sample to be tested 
is made alkaline and extracted with acetic ether. In the case of 
certain products it is best to subject them to varied preliminary 
treatment, depending on the case in hand. With such products as 
thin fruit syrups, simply make alkaline and shake out with acetic 
ether. In the case of thick fruit syrups, confectionery and pre- 
serves, dilute with water, add an excess of basic lead acetate, remove 
the lead by precipitation with sodium sulphate, filter and make the 
filtrate alkaline. 

Having thus obtained a clarified solution, use from 50 to 200 
c. c. of neutral acetic ether to say 500 c. c. of the alkaline solution, 
and shake in a separatory funnel. Separate the extract, filter, and 
evaporate to dryness. If the dulcin exceeds 0.04 gram per liter, 
crystal.*? will be apparent in the residue. If fats and resins are pres- 
ent in the residue, make repeated extractions with hot water, and 
evaporate to dryness. The purified residue is finally brought to dry- 
ness in a porcelain dish, and treated with i or 2 c. c. of sulphuric 
acid and a few drops of a solution of formaldehyde. Let it stand 
for fifteen minutes, and afterwards dilute with 5 c. c. of water. A 
turbidity or precipitate indicates dulcin. 

(2) Jorissen's Test. — The residue from the acetic ether ex- 
tract of an alkaline solution of the sample is treated with 2 or 3 c. c. 
of boiling water in a test-tube, and a few drops of mercuric nitrate 
are added. Heat the tube and its contents for five minutes in a 
boiling water bath, withdraw, and disregarding any precipitate, add 
a small quantity of lead peroxide. On the subsidence of the precip- 
itate, which quickly occurs, a fine violet color appearance forms for 
a short time in the clear upper layer in presence of 0.00 1 gram of 
dulcin. 

(3) Morpurgo's Method. — To the acetic ether residue, eva- 
porated to dryness in a porcelain dish, add a few drops of phenol 
and concentrated sulphuric acid, and heat a few minutes on the 
w^ater-bath. After cooling, transfer to a test-tube, and with the least 
possible mixing pour ammonia or sodium hydroxid over the sur- 
face. A blue zone at the plane of contract between the two layers 
indicates dulcin. 



GI.UCIN. 

This is a light-brown powder soluble in water, but not in ether 
and chloroform. It is three hundred times sweeter than cane sugar. 
Its symbol is CigH^gN^. 



ARTIFICIAL SWBETENEIRS AND ADULTERANTS. 301 

DETECTION OF GLUCIN. 

Dissolve in dilute hydrochloric acid and cool, then add a few 
•drops of sodium nitrite solution, followed by a few drops of an 
-alkaline solution or beta-napthol. A red color is produced. If re- 
sorcin or salicylic acid is used instead of beta-napthol, the color will 
T>e yellow. 

SULPHITES. 

Sulphurous acid, H^SOo., in the form of SO2, sulphur dioxid, 
is combined with soda and used as a preservative and as a bleaching 
agent. The sulphites are bisulphite of soda and hyposulphite of 
soda, the former being used largely in preserving meats and as a 
bleaching agent for corn and asparagus, also all kinds of dried 
fruits. Sulphur dioxide is widely distributed in nature and is pres- 
ent in minute quantities in various fruits and vegetable, and qualita- 
tive analytical tests for its presence must show more than a trace in 
order to establish the fact that it has been employed as a preserving 
or bleaching agent. That this substance is harmful to the human or- 
ganism is doubtful. The quantity which may be used in food pro- 
ducts is necessarily small since it imparts a sulphurous taste if used 
in excess. That sulphites are necessary in any branch of the food 
industry is doubtful. Corn bleached with them becomes tasteless 
and loses a great deal of its flavor; asparagus is better with a nat- 
ural color. Used as a bleach for evaporated fruits it may appear to 
be necessary, but if the public be educated to accept the natural fruit, 
its necessity will disappear. As a preventive of mold sulphurous 
acid is effective and may be recommended for cleansing the pack- 
ages and utensils employed in the food industry. 

For the detection of sulphites we give the official test, so that 
packers may analyze their own raw materials procured from outside 
sources. A microscopical inspection will show the presence of the 
crystals on raisins, currants, citron, etc., used in mince-meat and 
other preparations. If the sulphites are present on the raw ma- 
terial, of course the finished product will give the chemical reactions 
and may be condemned by the food commissioners. 

METHOD NO. I — BY DISTILI.ATION. 

Place 50 grams of the material in a distilling flask, add about 
5 c. c. of a saturated solution of glacial phosphoric acid, add enough 
distilled water to make up 100 c. c, and distil in a current of carbon 
dioxid until 50 c. c. have passed over. Take a few c. c. of the distil- 
late, add a slight excess of iodin solution, boil to expel excess of 
iodin, then acidify with hydrochloric acid and add barium chlorid 
solution. This test is very delicate and is easily applied. 



302 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

METHOD NO. 2 — BY REDUCTION. 

To about 25 grams of the sample placed in a 200 c. c. Erlen- 
meyer flask, add some pure zinc and several cubic centimeters of 
hydrochloric acid. In the presence of sulphites, hydrogen sulphid 
will be generated and may be detected by lead paper. Traces 
of metallic sulphids are occasionally present in vegetables, and by 
the above test will indicate sulphites. Hence positive results ob- 
tained by this method should be verified by the distillation method. 

It is always advisable to make the quantitative determination of 
sulphites, owing to the danger that the test may be due to traces 
of sulphids. A trace is not to be considered sufficient evidence that 
a sulphite has been used either as a bleaching agent or as a preser- 
vative. 

The chemicals described are those principally employed as pre- 
servatives of food. There are many more powerful in their germi- 
cidal power than these, but are either known poisons or are unstable 
and consequently cannot be employed as food preservatives. There 
are, however, various materials used in preparing raw materials 
and even finished products, which are preservatives in a slight de- 
gree, although not always employed for that purpose. Comm.on 
salt is a mild preservative and if used in the form of brine restricts 
fermentation, allowing only certain microorganisms to flourish, 
which generally belong to the lactic acid group, while the bacteria 
which elaborate foul products and gases are completely checked. 
first by the salt, and then by the lactic acid formed. 

Sugar, when used Jn sufficient quantities, is a preservative, be- 
cause it rapidly takes up the fluids to form syrups, and all bacteria 
are deprived of the moisture so necessary for reproduction or vege- 
tation. Small quantities of sugar have no antiseptic value, since the 
carbon is rapidly utilized to supply that element so necessary for the 
development of cell protoplasm, of bacteria. Thus small quantities 
of sugar are favorable to the growth of yeasts and molds, also vari- 
ous species belonging to the schizomycetes or fission fungi. Sugar, 
when split up by fermentation set up by yeasts and molds, is con- 
verted into alcohol, glycerin, carbonic acid, succinic acid, and other 
fatty acids, or it may be attacked by lactic acid bacteria and be 
split up into lactic acid without the evolution of gas. Sugar, when 
used as a heavy syrup, is antiseptic to a considerable degree, since 
most bacteria cannot obtain sufficient fluid to form new protoplasm. 

Acetic acid is employed as a preservative in the form of vine- 
gar, but some vinegars containing large quantities of organic mat- 
ter, do not possess much antiseptic power. Some vinegars are them- 
selves easily attacked by bacteria and their acetic acid is changed 
to carbonic acid and water. The best pickling vinegar is white 
wine, obtained by distillation ;cider, malt and fruit vinegars are very 



ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS AND ADULTERANTS. 303 

susceptible to changes if exposed to warm temperatures. The 5 
per cent white wine vinegar has antiseptic power and is largely used 
in all pickled goods. 

ARTIFICIAL COLORS. 

There are several reasons given by some manufacturers for 
the employment of artificial colors to brighten their goods; some 
claim that the uncolored product does not look appetizing, therefore 
it should be colored just enough to please the eye. In a sense we 
all eat with our eyes, and it is a question whether food has the same 
value if it does not appeal to the eye. Several experiments have 
been tried upon animals by feeding them blindfold and the results 
gave evidence that the food did not accomplish its full value, for 
the animals grew weak and emaciated. Some claim that colors 
should be used to cover up certain defects which cannot be avoided 
in present methods of manufacture. This claim is based on the 
discoloration of raw material, which is stored away in barrels and 
other wooden packages. It is claimed that during the busy sea- 
son the fresh products from the farms are delivered to the packers 
much faster than they can be worked into finished goods, and this 
necessitates the storing of partially prepared material in barrels and 
casks, until such time as may be more convenient for finishing. The 
tannic acid from the wood discolors this material very much, and the 
packers claim that it is necessary to restore its natural appearance by 
adding certain coal tar dyes which give the finished product the ap- 
pearance of freshly prepared stock. 

We all know that vegetables and some fruits lose some of their 
natural color during the heating which is necessary to properly 
sterilize them ; in some cases the color is changed slightly, though 
not faded ; corn is an example of this. Peas, string beans, aspara- 
gus, catsup, Chili-sauce, tomato chutney, fruit juices and many other 
raw materials lose a certain amount of their natural color in the 
sterilizing process and in the cooking or evaporating methods, but if 
these materials are prepared properly they will still retain enough of 
their original color to appeal to the palate, and do not need the ad- 
dition of coal tar dyes or other colors to replace the small amount 
of natural color lost during the preparation. 

Packers, who contract for more raw material than they are 
able to make up into finished goods, should not try to imitate first- 
class goods with the surplus material which they are forced to ac- 
cept, unless they have some good method for keeping it. No packer 
should contract for more raw material than he is able to handle 
properly, and if he does receive more and is forced to save it by 
partial cooking and storing in wooden packages, he should expect 



304 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

to sell same for its true value, and not attempt to bring up the 
standard by artificial colors. Xow to make this clear, we will take 
for example one packer who contracts just what tomatoes he thinks 
he is able to make up into catsup, Chili-sauce, etc., during the season 
and he employs all the help that is necessary to finish the goods and 
bottle same without having to store away any pulp, in other words, 
he invests at once in everything necessary to finish and take care of 
his daily receipts of raw material, and has that investment tied up 
for six or eight month ; his goods are not artificially colored nor do 
they need to be, and the quality will be the very best, but he goes 
into the market and finds goods just as bright, or perhaps brighter 
than his, which have been prepared from barreled stock and arti- 
ficially colored. The consumer, who does not know the circum- 
stances, perhaps purchased the brighter goods, thinking that the 
quality will compare favorably with the color. Now this is unfair 
to the other man, and he is discouraged in his efforts to manufacture 
pure goods simply because he has no protection. In order to get 
the very best goods it is necessary to protect the packers against 
every imitation ; then the inferior goods will show by their color that 
they have not been made from strictly fresh stock. The question 
then arises, "What shall be done with our surplus material which 
may accumulate, despite our best efforts to take care of it as fast 
as it comes in?" There should be arrangements made to put on 
extra help for such contingencies, or if this is impossible, the surplus 
stock should be canned in large size packages, such as five or eight 
gallon tin cans, and then sterilized in boiling water; this applies 
nicely to tomato pulp and if it be put away in this manner, it will 
open up nearly as fresh and bright as when first canned. Fruits 
contracted for preserving should be made up into finished goods at 
once, and if properly handled, will need no color to make the finished 
goods look well. There is always enough natural color in fruits 
to give a good appearance to jams, jellies and preserves, and it is 
pretty certain that such products when colored, are either adulter- 
ated, or they are prepared from stock which has been stored aw^ay 
in packages which have discolored the contents. Now if all this be 
true, is it not fair that the packer who prepares for the manufacture 
of his good directly from fresh stock and who employs the necessar>' 
labor and invests his money at once should have protection? If 
anyone stops to think of the result of measures to protect first-class 
goods, he can readily see that there will be an incentive to pack only 
first-class goods. One unit of inferior goods is much more diffi- 
cult to force into consumption than ten units of first-class goods. 
If every packer will elevate his standard to the very best, there w^ill 
be ten times the amount consumed. The great mass of the people 
use only sparingly of manufactured canned goods, preserves, jellies 



ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS AND ADULTERANTS. 306 

and food products in general, but let them feel confident that they 
are getting just as good, or perhaps better goods, than they prepare 
at home, and the demand for all kinds of food products will be won- 
derfully increased. For a time perhaps this will be difficult and ex- 
pensive for some packers who are not prepared to pack all of their 
daily receipts of raw material into finished goods at once, but it will 
probably have to be done to comply with Pure Food Laws. To do 
this perhaps it may be necessary to contract for less produce, or it 
will be wise in any event to prepare for storing raw material parti- 
ally finished in large size tin cans which may be sterilized. 

Some of the goods imported into the United States are very 
highly colored, so much so that they appear unnatural, and the De- 
partment of Agriculture has taken steps to stop the sale of such 
goods. Much of the blame for coloring our own goods is due to 
the imported goods; our manufacturers have been trying to imi- 
tate them because there seemed to be a popular belief that such 
goods were better than our own. 

This impression, no doubt, was made by the beautiful colors 
worked in by the French artists. There are no artificial colors so 
delicate and beautiful as those painted by nature and the American 
people are learning how to detect the difference. As a matter of 
fact, let me say that there are very few brands of imported goods 
that can compare in any way with those of some of our best home 
manufacturers. Our goods are not colored and perhaps not as 
uniform in sizes as the imported, but for flavor and natural color 
they far surpass those sold as fancy imported goods. This is true 
of the products of many other industries and I would not be sur- 
prised that our foreign friends should soon begin to take lessons 
from our manufacturers, indeed they are doing so to some extent 
now\ 

The hostile attitude of our Food Commissioners against the 
employment of colors in foodstuff has raised quite a storm among 
some manufacturers, but if we reason the matter, we must admit 
that an anti-color crusade is bound to correct many existing evils 
and will in the end be the means of elevating the standard of manu- 
factured foods. 

The profits on first-class goods are proportionately greater than 
on cheap goods, and as much money may be realized on a smaller 
pack of first-class goods as on a larger pack of cheap goods, and the 
general satisfaction which such goods give will make business a 
pleasure. The packer who is conscious of the fact that his goods 
are pure and wholesome, prepared from selected raw material in 
the best possible manner knows that each package will make for 
him a friend of every consumer, and that means increased demand 
for his goods and a reputation for quality. 



306 CANNING AND PRESERVING OP FOOD PRODUCTS. 

Some of the raw materials used by our packers may be colored 
and adulterated and we will give the outlines for making analyses 
to determine the presence of adulterants. For the complete study of 
dyes and colors our readers are referred to such works as "Schultz 
and Juliuson Organic Coloring" and "Allen's Commercial Organic 
Analysis/' but in a w^ork of this nature we can only mention some 
of the most important methods of color analyses. 

ARTIFICIAL COLORS. 

ANALYSES BY OI^FICIAL METHODS. 

The separation and identification of artificial colors in foods 
and raw material, which is used to make up a finished food product, 
is rather difficult in some cases, because the quantity employed is 
usually small, and becomes more or less mixed with the natural 
colors. In order to identify artificial colors, they must be separated 
in a pure state and then tested. 

Coal tar dyes are identified by the double dyeing method, and 
there need be no fear of mistaking theni, if due care is exercised. 
The extraction of colors simply by the amyl alcohol method, does 
not signify that those colors are of coal tar origin, since many of 
the natural fruit colors may be thus extracted, and it is possible to 
dye wool permanently with some of them. 

Coal tar dyes are poisonous, from the fact that they become 
contaminated with such metals as zinc, tin, lead and arsenic, the 
last being present in the sulphuric acid, which is usually employed in 
the manufacture of the dyes. Some of these dyes contain metals, 
such as malachite green, w^hich is a double chlorid of zinc, in com- 
bination w'ith the organic group. Many so-called vegetable colors 
are sold as lakes of tin or alum. Some colors contain picric acid, 
and naphahol yellow, and these are known poisons. 

Combinations of dyes are sometimes used, and are difficult to 
determine ; they are detected by a system of fractional dyeing, the 
fabric taking the different dyes at different rates of time. 

DETECTION OE COAL TAR DYES IN TOMATOES AND TOMATO PRODUCTS. 

Extract the color from dried pulp with ordinary alcohol and 
acidify with hydrochloric acid and filter. Eosin, which is most 
commonly used, gives a fluorescent filtrate. Dilute the filtrate with 
water, extract with amyl alcohol, and dye. Cochineal, if present 
in the form of a lake, will require strong hydrochloric acid to de- 
compose it. Separate the amyl alcohol, and wash until neutral. 
Then divide into two portions, to the first add drop by drop, a very 
dilute solution of uranium acetate, and shake thoroughly each time. 



ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS AND ADULTERANTS. 307 

The presence of cochineal is indicated by a characteristic emerald 
green color. To the second portion, add a drop or so of ammonia, 
and the presence of cochineal is indicated by a violet color. 

■ 

DETECTION 01^ ARTIEICIAL COLORS IN PEAS, BEANS, GHERKINS, 

ASPARAGUS, ETC. 

Copper salts are often used to give color to these vegetables, 
and sometimes zinc is also employed. Reduce 15 to 20 grams of the 
suspected sample to an ash, transfer the ash to a beaker, and treat 
with nitric acid; filter, make alkaline with ammonia, and if a pre- 
cipitate forms, filter again. A blue color indicates the presence of 
copper. To confirm this test, acidify the filtrate with acetic acid, 
add potassium ferro-cyanide. Red coloration or precipitate indi- 
cates the presence of copper, and verifies the first test. 

DETECTION 01^ TUMERIC IN VARIOUS PRODUCTS. 

Extract the color from suspected sample with alcohol. Dip a 
piece of filter paper into this tincture and dry at 212° F., after 
which moisten with weak solution of boric acid, to which a few 
drops of hydrochloric acid has previously been added. Dry again, 
and a cherry red color will indicate the presence of tumeric. This 
color is characteristic and may be learned by conducting a test on a 
known tumeric colored sample. 

DETECTION 01^ COAL TAR DYES IN JELLIES, JAMS, PRESERVES, ETC. 
METHOD NO. I. (SOSTEGNI AND CARPENTTERI.) 

From 10 to 20 grains of the sample are dissolved in 100 c. c. 
of water, filtered if necessary, acidified with 2 to 4 c. c. of 10 per 
cent solution of hydrochloric acid, and a piece of woolen cloth, 
which has been washed in a very dilute solution of boiling potas- 
sium hydroxid and then washed in water, is immersed in it and 
boiled for five to ten minutes. The cloth is removed, thoroughly 
washed in water, and boiled w^ith a very dilute hydrochloric acicl 
solution. Then after washing out the acid, the color is dissolved in 
a solution of ammonia hydroxid (i to 50). With some of the 
dyes the solution takes place quite readily, while w^ith others it is 
necessary to boil some time. The wool is taken out, a slight excess 
of hydrochloric acid is added to the solution, another piece of wool 
IS immersed and again boiled. With natural vegetable coloring 
matter this second dyeing gives practically no color, so there is no 
danger of mistaking vegetable colors for coal tar colors. // is abso- 
lutely necessary that the second dyeing should be done, as some coal 
tar dyes will produce a dirty orange in the first acid bath, which 
might easily be mistaken for a vegetable color, but on solution in 



308 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

alkaline bath, the second acid bath will produce a bright pink color, 
indicating that the dye was of coal tar origin. 

METHOD NO. 2. (aRATA.) 

This method has particular value for the detection of coal tar 
colors in fruit products. 

From 20 to 30 grams of the sample dissolved in 100 c. c. of 
water, are boiled for ten minutes with 10 c. c. of a 10 per cent so- 
lution of potassium bi-sulphate, and a piece of white wool or woolen 
cloth, which has been previously boiled in a very dilute solution of 
sodium hydroxid and thoroughly washed in water is boiled in the 
solution. After removal from the solution, the wool is washed in 
boiling w^ater, and dried between sheets of filter paper. If the col- 
oring matter is a natural fruit color, the wool will either be un- 
colored, or will take on a faint pink, or brown, which is changed to 
green or yellow by ammonia, and not restored by washing. 

In addition to this, it is advisable in all cases to dissolve out the 
coloring matter with ammonia, as in the first method, and dye again. 

An advantage in the second dyeing is, that if a large piece of 
woolen cloth be used in the first dyeing, and a small piece in the sec- 
ond dyeing, small amounts of caloring matter may l>e brought out 
much more decidedly in the second dyeing, where practically all of 
the vegetable coloring matter has been excluded. For the identi- 
fication of the various coal tar dyes, the reader is advised to consult 
special works on dyeing. 

DETECTION 01!' COAL TAR DYES BY EXTRACTION WITH SOLVENTS. 
METHOD XO. 3. (method USED IN PARIS MUNICIPAL LABORATORY.) 

The acid colors (sulphu-fuchsin, azo derivatives and phythal- 
eins)., are not precipitated by tannin and are insoluble or only 
slightly soluble in acetic acid or amyl alcohol. 

The basic colors (fuschsin, safranin. etc.) are precipitated by 
tannin, and are readily soluble in acetic ether and amyl alcohol. 

No. I. To 50 c. c. of suspected fruit liquid, add ammonium 
hydroxid in slight excess ; then add 1 5 c. c. of amyl alcohol, shake 
and allow to stand. 

(a) If the alcohol be colored red or violet, decant, wash, filter, 
evaporate to dryness in presence of a piece of wool, and test the 
dyed wool with sulphuric acid. 

(b) If the alcohol be not colored, separate and add acetic acid. 
If the alcohol becomes colored the presence of basic aniline color is 
indicated. 

(c) If the amyl alcohol be uncolored, both before and after 
the addition of acetic acid, no basic coal tar color is present. 



ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS AND ADULTERANTS. 309 

No. 2. Add an excess of calcined magnesia, and then a 20 
per cent solution of mercuric acetate, and bring to a boil. A color- 
ation before or after addition of acetic acid indicates the presence 
of coal tar dyes, particularly acid dyes. 

No. 3. Extract the solution with acetic ether made alkaline by 
barium hydroxid. This dissolves basic colors. 

In any case the colors must be fixed on wool, for many of the 
fruit colors are extracted, and will give reactions with sulphuric 
acid, which might possibly be mistaken for coal tar dyes. 

The double dyeing method will indicate clearly the difference 
between the natural vegetable or fruit colors and those of coal tar 
origin. 

DETECTION OF CARAMEL. 

Syrups, vinegars, sauces, vanilla extract and various other pro- 
ducts are colored with caramel, in many cases to give the impression 
that the color is due to valued properties. 

Ten c. c. of the solution to be tested are put into a high, narrow 
glass with perpendicular sides, as, for example, a small bottle; add 
from 30 to 50 c. c. of paraldehyde, depending on the intensity of 
the coloring, and enough absolute alcohol to cause complete mix- 
ing of the solutions. In the presence of caramel, a brownish yellow 
to dark brown precipitate will collect in the bottom of the glass. 
Decant the liquor, wash once with absolute alcohol, dissolve in small 
amount of hot water and filter. The color of this will give some 
idea of the quantity present. 

Concentration by evaporation on steam bath is not allowable, 
since caramel will be formed. Any concentration must be done 
over sulphuric acid or at diminished pressure. 

In order to further identify the color, it is poured into a fresh- 
ly prepared solution of phenylhydrazin (2 parts phenylhydrazin- 
hydrochlorid, 3 parts sodium acetate and 20 parts water). The 
presence of a considerable quantity of caramel gives a dark-brown 
precipitate in the cold which is hastenerl by slightly heating. Small 
amounts require a longer time for precipitation. 

DETECTION OF STARCH. 

The packer often purchases various raw materials which he 
uses in the manufacture of specialties. Sometimes a good body is 
given to certain substances by the addition of starch. This, of 
course, deceives the packer, and his finished product is liable to be 
condemned because he did not know of the existence of starch in 
his goods. The writer has received (and tested considerable) 
cream which has been thickened in this manner. 



310 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

Mustards are often thickened with wheat flour, and jellies are 
thus adulterated. There may be certain amounts of starch naturally 
in some of these substances, but a quantitative test will enable the 
packer to judge of this by analyzing a sample of known purity. 
Some unripe' fruits will show the presence of considerable starch, 
but later this is converted into sugar during the ripening. For 
this reason good judgment is necessary in making tests for starch 
in products made from certain fruits. If the suspected sample has 
much color, this may be destroyed with sulphuric acid and perman- 
ganate of potassium. First heat the sample to nearly 212° F. and 
add a small quantity of sulphuric acid followed by permanganate of 
potassium until the color is destroyed. A few drops of tincture of 
iodin will give a blue color indicating the presence of starch. 

There are various other raw materials used in special food 
formulas which are frequently adulterated, and it is necessary that 
the packers should know how to determine the presence of adulter- 
ants. 

Our food manufacturers desire a better standard than ever be- 
fore, and it is only a question of time when the emplojTiient of arti- 
ficial colors and adulterants of all kinds will be looked upon with dis- 
favor. Our efforts to bring out these points clearly may seem a 
little too far advanced, but imdoubtedlv there has been too much 
of this done, and, we believe, unnecessarilv. Let us have our ideal 
strictly pure, wholesome, unadulterated food products, and earnestly 
strive to establish that standard. 

Fruits and vegetables, jellies, preserves and other products 
whose color is easily affected, may now be put up in tin cans, coat- 
ed or enameled on the inside, with a substance which is impervious 
to acids and is baked on the tin in such a manner, that a heavy steri- 
lizing process does not remove it. 

This inside coating is done by two firms, The Sanitary- Can 
Company, of Fairport, N. Y.. and The National Canning & Manu- 
facturing Company, of Baltimore, Md. By using these cans, the 
problem of how to preserve the natural color of food products is 
solved. 



THE CANNING INDUSTRY. 311 



CHAPTER XL 
The Canning Industry 

A Short History. Location and Equipment of a Canning Factory. 
What to Can. Selection of Raw Material. 



A SHORT HISTORY, PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE. 

In the year 1810 N. Appert, a Frenchman, published his work 
on canning. He had received a prize of 12,000 francs from the 
French government the year previous. About the same time Peter 
Durrand obtained a patent in England for a process of preserving 
fruit, meats and vegetables in tin cans are the patents granted to a 
Frenchman by name of Pierre Antoine Angilbert, in 1823. In 
America, the canning industry was started in Maine, by Isaac Wins- 
low, in 1839, and about the same time Edward Wright began to 
pack oysters in Baltimore. 

Winslow began packing corn, which was very fine in quality, 
and he succeeded in preserving a great deal by simply processing 
the cans for several hours in boiling water. His first experiments 
were made with corn on the cob, but he soon discovered that the 
sweetness of the kernels w^as absorbed by the cob, so he gave up 
the idea and cut the corn by means of a curved and gauged knife. 

There are some records which seem to indicate that William 
Underwood began to pack certain foods in hermetically sealed pack- 
ages, in Boston, Mass., about the same time, or prior to the estab- 
lishment of corn packing in Maine. The records available prove 
that William Underwood did pack preserves and table condiments in 
glass, as early as 1828, and in 1836 he was packing tomatoes in 
glass, but there are probably no earlier records of goods having 
been packed in tin cans, than those of Isaac Winslow. 

In i860, the canning of corn, tomatoes, and fruits, was started 
by my father, Thomas Duckwall, near Cincinnati, Ohio. There is 
no record of any canning in the Middle States prior to that time, 
and thus Thomas Duckwall is recognized as the pioneer of the in- 
dustrv in that section. 

Tin cans were difficult to make and owing to the crude appara- 
tus for cutting tops and bottoms, the process was slow. A weight 
was pulled up to the ceiling and allowed to drop upon a sheet of tin ; 
a die was cast on the under side of the weight, and the opposite die 
was cast in a piece of metal below, so that the forming of tops and 



312 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

bottoms depended on the weight being properly guided. To make 
this operation as accurate as possible, the weight had two upright 
grooved guides, the same as those used to guide the weight in pile 
driving. My father made his first cans in this manner. 

Canning of fruits and vegetables began in California about 
1 86 1 -2, and to Francis Cutting belongs the honor of having been 
the first man to make and fill tin cans, although to his foreman, 
Alexander ^'oung^ belongs the credit of actually producing the re- 
sults, from his practical knowledge. California proved to be a 
splendid country for growing all kinds of fruits and vegetables, so 
that canning factories sprang up all over the state, and the present 
output is enormous. The quality of goods manufactured is high, 
and the canning business occupies a very prominent place in the 
list of California industries. 

The growth of the canning industry was rapid, after having 
been thus established in various parts of the country. New methods 
for making cans, improved machinery and skilled help quickly de- 
veloped, and the increasing demand for the goods, gave the neces- 
sary impetus. In the eighties the growth of the industry was phen- 
omenal, and new canneries sprang up like mushrooms all over the 
country, and the unskilled vied with the older-established packers, 
in the quantities of canned goods they could put up. The result 
was that a great deal of cheap, unwholesome goods soon flooded 
the market, and people became disgusted to the extent that they 
began putting up a large per cent of preserved and canned goods at 
home. 

There were several causes for this reaction ; the machinerv 
men and promoters pushed their plans too fast, and unskilled men 
took charge of the canneries, and were soon packing all kinds of 
fruits and vegetable, and much inferior stuff resulted from inexperi- 
ence. The wholesale grocers took a hand and began to squeeze the 
price down, at the same time requiring private labels which did not 
give the packer's name. Under such labels some very poor goods 
were manufactured, simply because the price w^as too lo\v. and the 
fictitious label relieved the packer of the responsibility for the 
quality. 

The result of low prices and loss of trade drove many canners 
out of the business, and the old established packers began with a 
determination to fiiake ^'quality" their aim. 

They began to give close attention to the selection of raw 
produce, forcing the farmers to furnish prime material, and to-day 
this is one of the most important factors in the production of first- 
class goods. Experienced men are in demand to supervise the 
work, and these are men who have not only a practical but also a 
scientific knowledge of canning and preserving. There is now a 



THE CANNING INDUSTRY. 313 

much better class of canned food products offered to the trade than 
ever before, but for some time there have been flourishing numerous 
concerns who have been packing a very poor quality of goods, es- 
pecially in the line of specialities. Some of these goods are so 
skillfully colored and preserved with antiseptics as to deceive the un- 
suspecting consumer. Thus we have the two extremes in manu- 
factured food products, one representing the very best, purest and 
most wholesome, that modern knowledge and skill are able to pro- 
duce: the other representing imitations of the better goods, and 
these are highly colored, adulterated and preserved by means of 
chemicals. 

OMiere has never been a time when strictly first-class food pro- 
ducts were manufactured in excess of their demand by the trade. 
On the other hand the market has l)een repeatedly overloaded and 
injured by the cheap goods we have mentioned. The people, and 
particularly the masses, as a rule purchase the cheap goods, and 
the quality is often so poor as to disgust them, so the whole industry 
suffers much when the reaction comes. The masses are good ad- 
vertisers of poor and also good food products and their condemna- 
tion or approval has power. 

// the people of this country had implicit confidence in ell nianu- 
factured food products, and all li^cre strictly first-class, the inaxi- 
muni capacity of all the fcctories icould be insufficient to supply 
the demand. If you take the yearly output of these factories, and 
figure out a pro rata for each person the result will convince you 
that there are wonderful possibilities for the food industry. This 
felicitous state of affairs can never be realized until all manufac- 
turers enjov the fullest confidence of the masses. 

Having briefly outlined the history of canning and preserving 
from its beginning and having pried into the future, we may take 
a broad view of the present crusade against impure and low grade 
foods: it cannot be doubter! that much good will result for the man- 
ufacturers. To be sure, if the laws are made excessivelv strict, 
some packers may be compelled to turn tlieir attention to other lines 
of business, but those who comply with the conditions set forth in 
a strict national law will enjoy an unparalleled future demand for 
their goods, because home canning and preserving will decrease in 
proportion to the decrease of impure, u'iwhole>ome and adulterated 
goods. 

How may this be done? Several ideas suggest themselves: 
First, there must be protection by a national law; second, strict 
compliance with the provisions of that law : third, a resolution to 
pack only the finest quality in cans or glass. To do this, it may 
be necessary to cut down the quantity of goods manufactured, in 
order that actual capacity may not be exceeded. The quality of 



314 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

such goods will no doubt bring as large, perhaps larger, returns than 
the goods of poorer quality. It may be necessary to employ more 
skillful men; it may be necessary to- lay aside a machine which 
crushes the fruits or vegetables according to present methods; it 
may be necessary to add improved machinery in one place and to 
employ hand work in another ; it may be necessary" to limit the sell- 
ing territory; but whatever it may require, the end will justify the 
means, profits will be larger, and. while capital may be limited, a 
good reputation and a growing trade will generally be an inviting" 
field for outside capital, if needed. 

LOCATION AND KQUIPMENT OF A CANNING FACTORY. 

The location of a canning factory is important, and the suc- 
cess of the business may depend entirely upon that, if everything else 
is all right. It is not enough to depend upon the ability to secure 
plenty of fruits, vegetables, etc. There must also be available help, 
and this is often a diflficult problem in small places. Glowing ac- 
counts of fine crops and offers of free ground have led many to es- 
tablish canning factories in various places, and the after failures 
were due to the difficulties experienced in securing sufficient and suit- 
able help to take care of the stock delivered by the farmers. Im- 
proved labor-saving machinery has done much to remove this diffi- 
culty, but it is often not an easy matter to procure suitable persons 
to operate the machinery. Then again, certain machinery may save 
labor yet may so crush and bruise the stock that only a poor quality 
of goods may result. Even good machinery may be so poorly op- 
erated as to ruin the quality of the stock. Goods of fine quality can- 
not be produced in a factory where the stock is filled into the cans 
in a careless manner. Another important factor in selecting a lo- 
cation is the shipping facility. A canning factory should be near 
one railroad, and near two, if possible. During the season it 
is often necessary to receive supplies promptly, and the shipping 
of finished goods should be done with as little hauling by wagons as 
possible. Where two railroads are available the rates are generally 
lower and the service much better than where one line has com- 
plete control. As a rule, it is better to locate the canning factory 
as near as possible to the larger cities and towns ; the difficulties ex- 
perienced in obtaining farm products may be greater, but these are 
more than offset by the advantages in securing good help and ship- 
ping accommodations. Promoters of canning factories have been 
to blame in many cases for the establishment of these enterprises in 
so many unfavorable places ; the many idle factories we see on coun- 
try cross-roads are witnesses to the truth of our statement, and 
the proper location of the canning factory must ever be a matter of 
prime importance. 



THE CANNING INDUSTRY. 315 

EQUIPMENT OF A CANNING FACTORY. 

The proper equipment of the factory is a most important con- 
sideration. A poor equipment or one that is out of date not only 
increases the cost of packing, but also is a hindrance in the pro- 
duction of best quality. The building itself should be adapted to 
the particular line of goods manufactured and the arrangements for 
receiving raw material and the shipping should be made in such a 
manner as to avoid any back steps. Whenever goods have to be 
taken over the same space two or more times the cost of produc- 
tion is materially increased. This is usually the result of imper- 
fections in building and should be overcome by making such addi- 
tions as may be necessary to facilitate the work. It is no uncom- 
mon sight to see goods trucked up and down elevators two or three 
times before shipment. A proper storage place should be laid off 
on the same floor from which the goods are to be shipped. It costs 
considerable to load and unload trucks and there is alwavs consider- 
able time lost in waiting for elevators. 

Every canning factory should have good boiler capacity, so 
that a nearly uniform steam pressure may be maintained without 
overfiring the boilers. The quality of a large per cent of food pro- 
ducts depends in part upon uniformity of steam pressure. A pres- 
sure of about 90 pounds gives splendid results generally. The 
proper circulation of steam in the sterilizing retorts is important and 
cannot be as uniform when the boiler pressure falls to 40 to 60 
pounds. There is always more or less condensation of steam at 
the optimum pressure, even when the pipes are covered with asbes- 
tos; but there is decidedly too much condensation at the low pres- 
sures mentioned. 

Nearly all of the old packers have had considerable experience 
along this line, and some very severe cases of spoilage have been 
traced directly to improper steam circulation, due to low steam pres- 
sure in the boiler. For scalding tomatoes there should be sufficient 
steam pressure to make water boil vigorously. This will loosen the 
skin of the tomato and will not cook the fruit. After the proper 
scalding of tomatoes, the thin skin will peel r^ff easily, and the to- 
mato will be cool inside and will be firmer, and will hold its juice 
mucli better than when partially cooked during the scalding. Some 
factories have considerable waste in the peeling; the fruit had been 
partly cooked and a layer of the tomato would come off with the 
peel ; this is due to poor steam. 

For blanching purposes there sliould always be good steam 
pressure, and for all evaporating work the pressure should be high. 
The making of tomato catsup. Chili-sauce, etc., requires sufficient 
steam pressure to insure perfect circulation in the jacket of the ket- 



316 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

tie; this will insure rapid evaporation and ebullition sufficiently 
strong to avoid scorching or sticking. 

All goods which are to be cooked with live steam should 
have high pressure to avoid as much as possible the' water of con- 
condensation so copious in steam of low pressure. The water of 
condensation has a peculiar flat taste so ofcen observed in distilled 
water, and this flavor is imparted to some goods, which greatly in- 
jures their quality. 

To get the best resuUs w-ith steam, it is quite essential that all 
cooking should be done as near to the boiler room as possible. The 
nearer the cooking is to the boiler the less will be the water of con- 
densation, and the better will be the circulation. If coal be used as 
fuel for boiler, the automatic feed is to be commended as a clean and 
labor-saving apparatus ; it cannot always be used to advantage, how- 
ever, because it requires a coal storage, one floor above the boiler 
room. 

For power and lighting, the electric system is better and more 
economical than belting. The power may be carried to all parts of 
the building through small, well insulated wires, which may oper- 
ate motors at the points most advantageous, and when not in use 
may be shut off, thus saving considerable energy. This system is 
ei;pecially attractive where the business is large and conducted on 
several floors or in different buildings. 

The various products which are to be canned, preserved or 
bottled, generally require machinery specially constructed to do the 
work, and when it is known just what kinds of goods are to be pre- 
pared, it is a matter of judgment to determine what machines are 
the best for the purpose. There are machinery manufacturers who 
have special lines for the canning of all regular products, such as 
corn, peas and tomatoes, and the catalogues describe them fully. 
Some modern machinery, however, is built more for speed than 
quality, and it is impossible to produce strictly first-class goods. 
Special care must be taken to adopt no filling machine which in any 
way crushes the product to be canned. Some of the tomato fillers 
on the market crush and mash the fruit so badlv that the contents 
afterwards appear more like slo]) than standard. It would be diffi- 
cult to do all of this work by hand, nor is it necessary, because the 
consumer does not look for canned tomatoes firm and whole, unless 
he calls for such goods, which are classed as "fancy." It has been 
decided that the best tomato-fillers do not crush the fruit as much as 
the ordinary careless hand-filler. All fancy goods are filled by 
hand, however, and only uniform, selected tomatoes are used. 

There are two systems for hermetically sealing tin cans. One 
used in European countries, and also in this countr\% seals the can

by crimping the top on to the flanged body, the seaHng being made 
secure by a patented cement resembUng rubber. This method has 
many advantages over the ordinary method of soldering; fruits and 
vegetables may be filled into the cans whole; there is no danger of 
getting any soldering solution inside the cans; there is absolutely 
no danger from lead poisoning, which is perhaps wrongfully blamed 
on the soldering system, although cans which are sealed with solder 
do not find favor in several foreign markets for this alleged rea- 
son. 

With due care I believe that the wonderfully improved auto- 
matic capping machines, such as are used all over this country, will 
seal the cans perfectly without any danger of lead poison afifect- 
ing the contents. There are times, however, when these machines 
get out of order and do not work smoothly, and great care must be 
exercised to avoid contaminations from soldering solution and small 
drops of solder. The latter often get into the cans from the "tip- 
ping'' or ^'dotting,'' wiiich must not be done until the caps are cooled 
sufficiently. From my experience, it is a wise plan to chill the cans 
with air from the blower or to keep tlie tippers at least fifteen feet 
from the capping machine. 

The Calcium System is manufactured by The Sprague Canning 
Machinery Company, of Chicago. 

For processing, some prefer the regular steam retorts, some 
use the calcium and oil systems, and for open bath sterilization sim- 
ply the open retorts filled to a certain height with boiling water, or 
the continuous system where the cans travel through water. These 
systems are all good for certain lines, but the continuous calcium 
system offers some advantages, from the fact that a given tempera- 
ture may be maintained without the constant escape of steam. The 
small expense of keeping the temperature at a given point is one 
of the chief attractions of this svstem ; this mav be done with the 
exhaust steam from the engine or with only a small supply of steam 
direct from the boiler. After the first cost is paid the running ex- 
pense is small and the cost may be saved (on fuel) in a short time. 

In connection with the canning of peas there are machines used 
for vining and hulling vvhich must be operated in such a manner 
that the shelled peas may be quickly separated and canned before 
decomposition sets in. I do not know of any system where the 
danger of depreciating the quality is so .G:reat, unless due care is 
exercised in handling the peas quickly. The viners are sometimes 
operated several miles away from the factory, and the hulled peas 
are put into baskets to a depth of five to eight inches ; and are then 
hauled on wagons and piled up ahead of the separating machines. 
Sometimes several hours elapse before these peas are blanched and 
in that time the bacteria usually found on the vines and hulls gret a 
wonderful start, producing bitter compounds and mucilaginous sub- 



318 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

Stances which so often cause turbidity and ropiness in the Hquor of 
canned peas. 

The machines to which we have referred are wonderful achieve- 
ments of skill and practical knowledge, and if properly operated give 
better results than hand work, but they should always be set up 
quite near the factory and should not be operated faster than the 
peas can be handled in the canning department. Many samples 
of canned peas, having clouded liquor, have been sent to the Na- 
tional Canners' Laboratory, and the cause has been frequently traced 
to the improper method of operating the vining machines. The 
vines should be cut, hauled to the factory, and the motto should 
then be : ''From the vine to the can in the shortest possible time/' 

The manufacturer of special food products requires special 
machinery, which may have to be built according to the packer's 
ideas and for the accomplishment of special requirements. There 
are a great many special food products sold under trade names, and 
the machinery for such will be described under the particular head- 
ings. One important fact must ever be borne in mind, viz. : Every 
package will reach a customer, and if there are any defects due to 
carelessness on the part of employees who operate the machines or 
to break-downs, they should be watched and the cans should be in- 
spected at the point nearest to the final sealing, and all that are de- 
fective in any way should be taken out. Every can either makes a 
friend or an enemy of the consumer, and the proper handling of the 
equipment is therefore very important. 

Capacity of the equipment is another important factor in pro- 
ducing goods of fine quality. There should always be enough ma- 
chines to take care of all the raw material received as rapidly as pos- 
sible. It is not wise to run full with no reserve machines to take up 
the work in case of break-downs. This point is frequently over- 
looked by some packers and it happens most frequently that the cap- 
ping machines are unable to take care of the cans. A reserve ma- 
chine should always be kept in good running order, so that any 
breakdown may not delay the cans which are waiting to be sealed. 

It is not a good plan to operate too many automatic machines 
in a single system. Automatic machines frequently get out of 
order, or need adjustment of some delicate parts, and if a number 
are operated in a single system, there is too much loss of time. 

It is better to operate some machines, from separate shafting, 
and regulate the speed in such a manner as to keep the whole system 
in running order. 

Machines should never be crowded too closely. As a rule, 
losses and damaged goods result from overcrowding. There should 
be plenty of room to operate them and the most experienced people 
placed in charge, to get the best results. 



THE CANNING INDUSTRY. 319 

There are many factories throughout the country which are not 
properly equipped. Every improved machine should be carefully 
studied, especially if it has any advantage in the speed and char- 
acter of work turned out. Many packers, on the other hand, go to 
extremes and adopt every new machine put on the market, whether 
it offers any advantage or not, and the expression, "I am machinery 
poor," is frequently heard. It is perhaps a good plan to take in, on 
trial, any machine which appears to offer some advantages, but if 
there is loss of time or danger of injuring the quality of the goods 
it should not be accepted. Therefore the proper equipment of a 
canning factory is a problem which must be solved by every packer 
for himself. The chief points to be observed are the continuous 
arrangement, to avoid retracing; selection of only the best machines; 
the proper placing and operating, w^ith due regard always for speed 
and improved quality of the goods manufactured. 

WHAT TO PACK. 

This is an important consideration; "what to pack" claims the 
attention before either building or equipment. It is sometimes diffi- 
cult to foretell just what specialties may become a part of the busi- 
ness after it is established, but it must be decided just what will be 
the best line of goods to be manufactured. When the conditions 
are favorable, peas, tomatoes and corn are packed by some houses, 
but generally not more than two of these are packed in one location. 
In some locations the whole interest centers in one, and then other 
kinds of goods, such as berries, fruits, pumpkin and a long line of 
specialties, are packed to kee]) the factory in active operation and 
give employment to valued help. 

There are certain sections of the United States where peas, 
tomatoes or corn are better in ([uality than those grown anywhere 
else; thus the New England states. New York and a few other 
places, are noted for the fine, rich flavor of the corn grown there. 
Michigan, Wisconsin and some other places are noted for the deli- 
cate, sweet flavor of their peas. Delaware, Maryland and Indiana 
are noted for their excellent tomatoes, and many other places have 
records for the excellency of this valuable product. 

There are certain localities where a very excellent crop of any 
of these staples is raised occasionally, and when the report is pub- 
lished it sometimes proves a strong inducement for the establishment 
of canning factories. There are many places which boast of their 
canning factories and are not able to supply them with the products 
to keep them running. 

There are certain localities where the conditions seem favor- 
able for large crops of peas, corn, etc., and in fact large quantities 
are grown, but the flavor and quality in general is quite poor in 
comparison with that of more favored places; the peas are mealy 



320 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

and almost tasteless perhaps, or the corn is tough, dry and not sweet, 
and so it is impossible to get a quality of the canned article that 
will compare favorably with that of other sections. 

It is for this reason that saccharin has been so generally used 
by packers of peas and corn in unfavored locations. There is no 
question but that a small addition of granulated sugar does im- 
prove the quality, but the cost is great, and so saccharin sold under 
various trade names has been used by not a few packers. 

In determining what to pack, it is not enough to have large 
crops of any particular fruit or vegetable, but the quality must also 
be determined to see how it will compare with that of well known 
standards. All the skill and knowledge possible would not raise 
the standard up to the very best, unless the original quality w^as 
good. How many houses are trying to do this very thing ? When 
it is certain that the raw product is inferior in quality and that no 
amount of skill in packing w^ill ever bring the finished product up to 
the regular standard, it w^ould be wise to discontinue for the rea- 
son that no reputation can be built up on such goods, and even 
though a small margin may possibly be realized, the reputation is 
injured and the general effect on the market is not good. A loca- 
tion may be very favorable for packing tomatoes, but not for corn, 
so it would be better to build up a line of tomato specialities which 
may be manufactured during the months following the tomato sea- 
son, and not attempt to pack corn, even though large crops may be 
realized, if the quality be not up to that of recognized standards. 

Some houses make a specialty of canning tomatoes and follow 
this with the manufacture of tomato catsup. Chili-sauce, etc., which 
is a splendid idea if the tomatoes are well suited for making these 
condiments. It is a fact worthy of notice, however, that only a few 
localities produce tomatos fit for strictly first-class tomato catsup. 

Much (;f the piquant flavor of catsup is due to the natural acid- 
ity of the tomato, and such tomatoes are not as solid and meaty as 
are generally used for canning purposes. As a rule the finest to- 
matoes for canning are solid and do not contain too much juice. 

Small fruits are not grown in sufficient quantities for canning 
purposes outside of certain sections, such as the eastern and extreme 
w-estern coast states and the fruit belt near the Great Lakes, and al- 
though other localities may at times have crops of berries and 
peaches, they are, as a rule, inferior in size and flavor to those grown 
in the places we have named. It is possible, however, to have these 
fruits shipped into less favored places, and they may be either can- 
ned or made up into jellies, preserves, butters and jams : but the ex- 
pense of shipping is great and the quality very materially aflfected, 
therefore, it is advisable to pack such goods as near as ix)ssible to the 
point where the fruits are grown. One factory in California is 
located in the center of its orchards and the flavor and quality of the 



THE CANNING INDUSTRY. 321 

goods packed is very fine and is a credit not only to the firm, but also 
to the whole industry. The fruit is packed as soon as it is picked. 

There is a long list of specialties, some of which may be added 
to a business which will keep the factory running between seasons, 
and they are quite profitable, too, if the very highest quality is main- 
tained. There are a number of concerns which produce lines of 
specialities to fill in between seasons, and the quality of the goods is 
so poor that the market is glutted, and the whole industry suffers 
materially. 

Some of the houses of which we are speaking sent up into 
Michigan several years ago and bought large quantities of navy 
beans which were moldy and blighted on account of rains and un- 
favorable crop conditions. These beans were soaked, boiled and 
covered with a very low grade of sauce, and No. 3 cans were sold 
on the market for 10 cents. They were not fit to eat and the peo- 
ple became disgusted with this specialty in so much that even the 
goods of highest quality moved slowly for a time. 

The same practice injures the catsup market frequently. To- 
mato canners will dump their tomato peelings into open-head bar- 
rels or casks and perhaps let them sour and almost decompose be- 
fore they are made up into pulp and finally into catsup. It might 
be remarked that catsup made from such material will keep almost 
indefinitely without any preservative. The lactic acid formed dur- 
ing the decomposition of the peelings, takes the place of vinegar and 
preserves the catsup. Some of the strictly pure catsups mentioned 
in the Agricultural reports are manufactured from such refuse, 
and arguments against the employment of chemical preservatives in 
fine catsup have been built upon the facts mentioned. Fine catsup 
requires a preservative unless it is sterilized. The effect of such 
poor goods thrown on to the market injures the sale of even the 
finest grades, because people become dissatisfied and turn to other 
goods, or they make catsup at home and quit buying altogether. 

There was a time when the manufacture of jellies, preserves, 
butters and jams was a profitable business : this was in the begin- 
ning, when all were made from the pure fruits, and there were no 
imitations or adulterations widely known. There was a good de- 
mand, and the profits were good, but when the imitations and adul- 
terations became so gross that the goods had no flavor nor resem- 
blance to the fruit from which it was claimed to be manufactured, 
the people quit buying the stuff and the prices dropped so low that 
there was no inducement to pack these goods. 

Today, however, there are a number of such lines manufac- 
tured from strictly first-class material, and are pure, and there is 
quite a good demand for them, but the market has been greatly in- 
jured by the inferior lines and it will require time to restore confi- 
dence. 



322 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

It is well when any line of specialties is to be made a part of 
the business, to manufacture such goods as will be harmonious w^th 
the regular line. For instance, if the canning of tomatoes is to be 
the principal product, the line analogous would include tomato 
catsup. Chili-sauce, and perhaps tomato soup and goods requiring 
tomato sauce or other delicacies which combine nicely with toma- 
toes. It is surprising how naturally the side lines have sprung out 
and helped make some of the gigantic institutions identified with 
the food industry. 

The lines w-hich have sprung out of the dressing of meats for 
the market are ^he canning of meats, soups ; also extracts, oils, medi- 
cines and chemicals, and other lines seemingly to have no connect- 
ion, and yet very important in the saving of material formerly 
wasted. 

SELECTION OF RAW MATERIAL. 

The selection of rozv material is perhaps the most important of 
all steps in the art of canning and manufacturing food products. 
How is it possible for a firm to produce goods of fine quality unless 
the raw material is of the very best ? To begin, there should be a 
thorough understanding with the growers just what variety' is to 
be planted. Vegetables such as corn, peas and tomatoes should 
be grown according to contract, and it is a good plan for the packer 
to select the variety or furnish the seed to the farmer. If toma- 
toes are to be grown, the packer should decide w'hether he intends to 
manufacture catsup and similar products at the same time and fur- 
nish seed for the varieties which produce the best natural color and 
those which are piquant in flavor. If the packer decides to pack 
corn, he should select the seed of such varieties as are white and 
sweet, and if peas are to be canned, the varieties should be only those 
which are tender, sweet and those which retain their natural color 
well. These same principles should be applied to all products so 
far as possible. The next step is the contract with the growers, 
which should be as strict as possible, especially covering the time 
of harvesting and delivery. All farm products should be delivered 
on the same day when they are taken from the field. As we have 
stated in previous pages, the motto should be : "From the field to 
the can in the shortest possible time." Raw material which has 
stood over one day loses much of its flavor, and liesides offers great 
objections from a bacteriological standpoint. If the product is 
wilted or softened or partially decomposed the flavor is greatly in- 
jured and the liability to spoilage is increased. We have shown 
how necessary it is to increase the time for sterilization in this case. 
and this means additional loss of flavor, so that the result of it all 
will be only inferior goods. During some seasons various blights. 



THE CANNING INDUSTRY. 323 

rusts, smuts and rots attack the raw material and cannot be avoided 
absolutely, through our present inability to cope with the fungi and 
molds which are responsible ; but we are able to cut away such por- 
tions and use only the good parts. Tomatoes and cabbage are li- 
able to black rot, apples are sometimes attacked by fungi, also other 
parasites, and i£ these parts are removed the good parts are equal in 
flavor to sound fruit so far as I have been able to determine, because 
the disease is onlv local and does not affect the whole fruit unless, 
of course, it has advanced too far. Whenever possible, however, 
only perfectly sound material should be used, but it sometimes hap- 
pens that these diseases cannot be avoided and the best has to be 
made of the matter. 

In selecting all ingredients which enter into the various formu- 
las for making special food products, the very best are to be used 
always. It may be necessary to make anal}^ses of some to determine 
their purity and the presence of colors and antiseptics, and a careful 
study of the official analyses given in Chap. IX will be found ser- 
viceable. Wherever possible the packer should familiarize himself 
with every detail of his business. He should know the chemical 
composition of the fruits and vegetables he cans, also the food value 
of each, and should study the effect of various degrees of heat on 
the nutritious properties. Of course this is impossible if the busi- 
ness is large, and in that case he must employ men who are able to 
investigate all practical and scientific problems relating both to raw 
materials and the finished goods.

Parasite, Chemical Composition and Food Value of Peas, 
Methods of Canning, Machinery, Bacteria Associated with Spoil- 
age, as Found in Various Actual Losses. 



HISTORY. 

The garden pea belongs to botanical order of Leguminosae, in 
the sub-order Papilionaceae, and family Sativum. The origin of* 
peas antedates all written history, since early records show that 
they were common at that time in the East. Holland seems to have 
been the first European country to cultivate this variety of pulse 
during the middle ages, and from that country they were introduced 
into England, and then the seed peas were probably brought over 
to America by the pilgrim fathers. There are tw^o kinds of peas, 
which are separated botanically into distinct families, viz., the field 
pea, cultivated as feed for cattle, and the much esteemed garden 
pea, ; but it is probable that, originally, these were the one species, 
the latter having undergone marked changes under special care of 
horticulturists, until it now yields a highly-prized article of food. 

The flowers of the field pea are red and only one to each flower- 
stock, while those of the garden pea are more commonly white, sel- 
dom red, and there are two or more to each flower-stock. The pea 
vine is a climbing annual, having pennate leaves, ovate leaflets and 
branching tendrils. 

There are many varieties of garden peas cultivated especially 
for canning purposes, and these are selected with due regard for 
small sizes, sweetness and flavor, since the small sizes are in great 
demand and bring the best prices. There are, however, large sizes 
of the wrinkled variety, which are very sweet, and have a goo<l 
market at all times. One variety often grown for the market, be- 
cause of its excellent vield, has black eves and verv little flavor. 
\Mien canned these peas have a mealy, slightly bitter taste, and can- 
not compare in any w^ay to such varieties as the Little Gem, Alaska, 
Admiral Advancer, Horsford's Market Garden and others. 

The canning of peas originated in France some time between 
t8io and 1820, under Appert and others wdiose names are not 
known to us. Such excellent peas have been cultivated and canned 



PEAS. 325 

in France that their reputation is ahuost world wide; but in late 
years there has been too much artificial coloring with copper salts, 
and there is considerable objection to them on that account. The 
French, however, give more attention to the cultivation of peas than" 
Americans, and have as a result a much, larger per cent of small 
sizes, which are sweeter and more palatable than the larger and 
more matured sizes. 

In America, pea packing began about i860 in Baltimore, and 
the demand became so great that the industry was almost unable to 
meet it, although every canning house in the country packed them 
wherever the location was favorable for growing them. The labor 
connected with picking peas in the fields, and hulling them at the 
factories, was enormous, and this expense naturally made the re- 
tail price a little too high for the masses; but in 1890-1892 Messrs. 
Chisholm & Scott overcame the difficulties of hulling by machinery, 
and by wonderful genius, machines were perfected, which no longer 
necessitated hand work either in the field or the factory, so far as 
picking and hulling were concerned. From this time until the de- 
structive pea louse appeared and devastated the crops of peas in 
many places, the canning of this popular vegetable increased won- 
derfully, even to the extent of over-production. 

xAll varieties of peas were grown and in localities which were 
unfavorable the peas did not have a good flavor, so that the quality 
of a certain per cent of those packed in 1891 and 1892 was not 
strictly first-class. As we stated in the last chapter, there are only 
certain sections of the country well suited for cultivating peas. The 
flavor of these is due to several causes ; the climate is such that the 
growth is rapid, consequently the peas are very tender and sweet, 
the soil is particularly adapted to the development of the nodules 
or legumes, which are excrescences from the roots, and have the 
power of fixing the free nitrogen, which is then used by the plants 
themselves. These nodules are bacteria, and are termed nitrogen- 
fixing bacteria and bacteroids. 

The nitrifying bacteria also assists in the formation of nitro- 
gen salts, which are used by the growing plants, so that soil which 
contains large numbers of these microscopical organisms furnishes 
the best possible condition for the growth of peas. 

Peas grow well in chalky and other calcareous soils, but a fine 
growth depends almost entirely upon the presence of bacteria we 
mentioned, and it is possible to prepare the conditions artificially, 
which will secure a fair yield even in most unfavorable locations, 
by making pure cultures of these bacteria and mixing them with 
the vSeed when planted, so it is probably well that we make a closer 
examination and study of these minute organisms which are so use- 
ful. 



326 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

ASSIMII.ATION OK NITROGEN. 

The sources of nitrogen for the use of plants are : The atmos- 
phere (which contains about 79 per cent by volume) ; the nitrates 
and nitrous acid formed in the vsoil and air; ammonia (produced by 
the putrefaction of dead matter) ; manure and fertilizers, which 
contain nitrogenous compounds; and from the tissues of plants and 
animals. Plants cannot of themselves use nitrogen in free form, 
so it must first be fixed in combinations suitable for its assimilation. 
The value of fertilisers lies in the amount of nitrate of soda which 
they contain, and this salt is found naturally in Chile and Peru, 
South America, where it has accumulated for hundreds of years by 
the nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which use the free nitrogen of the air 
and combine it with soda, so plentiful in those regions. These ni- 
trate beds are being exhausted rapidly, how^ever, nearly one and a 
half million tons being exported annually, the value being about $65 
a ton. Nitrate of soda is used in such large quantities in various 
industries that the supply for fertilizing is growing less, and it is 
estimated that within fifty years the natural beds will be exhausted ; 
so some other means of obtaining the salt for plant life is a problem 
which is open for solution by every one. Since the discovery that 
certain bacteria have the power of utilizing the free nitrogen of the 
air, and are able to fix it w'ith soda, it has been discovered that cer- 
tain plants have a tendency to form legiunes or tubercles upon 
their roots, and that these are nothing more or less than nitrogen- 
fixing bacteria, which supply the plant itself wHth the nitrogen ele- 
ments, so that the bacteria themselves are used by the plant and 
are its hosts, contrary to the general system seen in nature, where 
the breaking down of animal and vegetable protoplasm is a source of 
life and energy for the development and growth of fermentative, 
putrefactive and parasitic micro-organisms. 

The green pea is one of the species of plants which invites the 
nitrogen-fixing bacteria, and at first furnishes them the elements 
necessary for their growth, afterward claiming them for its own ex- 
istence and building up a healthy stem with flowering branches, 
gives evidence of its well nourished condition in the well filled pods 
of tender, sweet peas, so earnestly sought by all lovers of this fine 
flavored garden pulse. 

When peas are planted in a soil containing all the elements for 
growth excepting nitrogen, they will thrive well if there are any 
nitrogen-fixing bacteria present, because these little workers \\\\\ 
build up the nitrates for the plants, but if none of these are present 
the grow^th is poor, because they must feed upon the carbohydrates, 
albumen, fat, etc., accumulated in the seed-leaves, so when this sup- 
ply is exhausted the plants cease grow'ing, and the leaves lose their 
chlorophyl, turning yellow, and there is perhaps no disposition to 



PEAS. 327 

bear the pods. The plants in this case are suffering from what is 
termed nitrogen hunger. When at this stage, if the soil near the 
root be moistened with water containing the nitrogen-fixing bac- 
teria, wonderful change? will be noticed in a short time. The 
stock and branches will grow stronger, the leaves will turn green, 
and the pods will fill with peas rapidly. In order to properly grow 
peas in some localities where very poor or only occasional crops 
are obtained, a means is now offered to the packer of helping the 
growers to obtain good crops at all times, and this discovery is of 
course valuable to canners, because they must, to a certain extent, 
be guides for the farmers, who do not, as a rule, keep posted on sci- 
entific researches in agriculture.

Plate 99. Nitrogea Fixing Bacteria 

Photomicrograpb X 1,000. Bacillus Radlclcala, rod torms cultivated on special agar 

In i888 Beyerinck made the discovery that the nodules of 
in)>ercles on the roots of plants belonging to the order of Legumin- 
osas were composed of bacteria which had changed from simple 
motile rods into a complete involutionary form, having no resem- 
blance to the original micro-organisms whose protoplasm had been 
used to buiiti up bacteroidal tissue. He obtained pure cultures from 
the nodules, and used the leaves of the plant with the addition of 7 
per cent gelatin, ^ per cent asparagin and J^ per cent of cane sugar, 
as a solid culture medium for isolating them. 

To cultivate them in pure cultures, we take a nodule from the 
roots of the pea and wash it with water, then steep it in absolute al- 
cohol for about two minutes, and then drive off the alcohol with 
ether. The nodule is then cut open and a portion of the bacteroidal 
tissue is introduced into a small quantity of water, which has been 
sterilized in a cotton-plugged test tube at 250 degrees F. for twenty 



328 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

minutes. After the infusion has stood a while, the Petri dishes 
containing the nutrient medium previously described are moistened 
on the surface with drops of the infusion ; the gelatin will absorb the 
water and leave the germs free on the surface. These will develop 
and form small mucinous colonies, which do not liquefy the gelatin, 
and streak cultures may be made from these. Two varieties of 
micro-organisms are thus separated, one which has been named 
Bacillus radicicola rods, is about i /* broad and 3 to 4 i* long. They 
are strongly aerobic and may be seen to seek the air bubbles under 
the coverglass or to wander towards the edge of the glass. The 
other variety, called Bacillus radicicola rovers, is exceedingly small. 
being only about 0.9 /* long and 0.18 |a broad; they are motile, pos- 
sessing a single terminal flagellum, which is about twenty times as 
long as the cell, and gives it a very rapid movement, which enables 
it to break away from the parent colony and travel rapidly across 
the surface of the gelatin. The germs are so small that they readily 
pass through the Chamberland filter and escape ordinar\^ notice in

charge of Laboratory of Plant Culture. Bureau of Plant Industry, 
for his first cultures of these organisms, but we have obtained even 
better cultures for peas from the young nodules previously de- 
scribed, and pure cultures are now grown in the National Canners' 
Laboratory and these are free to all subscribers for distribution 
among growers whose ground seems unfavorable at times for pro- 
ducing good crops of peas. It is possible to take a dry culture con- 
taining millions of these germs, and inoculate a quantity of rain 
water specially prepared with nutrient material, and after a few- 
days soak the seed peas in the water, and plant them, or the manure 
that goes into the field may be moistened with such water, and 
the bacteria mav thus be distributed over a field in such a manner 
that the crop of peas will be twice as great as is ordinarily grown 
on the same ground. 

The bacteria which prove so valuable in fixing the atmospheric 
nitrogen for the benefit of peas, have a peculiar life history. They 
are widely distributed, in the air, water and soil, but are frequently 
absent in some localities, or if not entirely absent, are so few in 
numbers as to be of little value to the peas sown in such places. If 
the^eed peas be moistened in water, which has received a pure cul- 
ture, they will be carried into the ground and will be able to grow 
and multiply rapidly as soon as the tiny hair-like roots begin to force 
themselves downward into the soil. 

The roots absorb the moisture from the soil, and through the 
epidermal cells, the bacteria gain entrance and rapid multiplication 
takes place by the fission process, so that in a short time the sap 



is teeming with countless myriads of these tiny organisms, which 
fill up all the channels, multiplying until this cycle of their life 
history is accomplished. 

The bacteria are seen to be gathered into colonies in various 
places where hard membranes surround them, and sacs are formed 
which grow outward and beyond the bark cells of the roots, so that 
tubercles or nodules are formed and these become hard and present 
the appearance of tissue. The tissue is formed by the bacteria 
themselves, which no longer have any of their original characteris- 
tics or forms, but are matted together into bacteroidal tissue, which 



Plate 100. Nodule Bacteria Kadicola 



is called by A. B. Frank, mycoplasma. The name which lias been 
given to these cells is "bacteroids," which indicates their origin 
from bacteria. The bacteroids are rich in albumen, and never 
again grow into the rod forms, seeming to have entirely lost repro- 
ductive power. The accompanying plates will give some idea of 
the changes which the bacteria undergo from the rods to the forma- 
tion of the nodule tissue. 

It will be noticed that slight swellings appear at the ends, which 
begin to divide into branches or forks, later taking on distinct Y 
forms, which unite and form a meshwork, or reticulated bands. 
Within this meshwork are frequently found rod-shaped bacteria 
which seem to have escaped the involution which has affected others 
of their kind, and these bacteria may be employed to start pure cul- 
tures on specially prepared nutrient media.

According to A. B. Frank, the nodules formed on the roots of 
peas, differ from those of other Leguminosae, in chemical composi- 
tion, and contain besides albumen, carbohydrates, which he names 
amylodextrins; but other investigators have sliown that the socalled 
amylodextrins were fatty substances.

As the tubercles grow older they increase in size, and con- 
tain larger amounts of nitrogenous substances which are utilized 
rapidly by the peas, resulting in abundant stalks, leaves, flowers and 
pods containing the green vegetable coloring matter called chloro- 
phyK so much esteemed for appearance in canned peas. The chlor- 
ophyl, therefore, is most abundant where the peas are well supplied 



with nitrogen from ihe root nodules. The accompanying Figure 
No 20 will show the young nodules clinging to the roots and cross 
sections magnified to give some idea of their appearance.

J. Stoklasa has made a number of quantitative analyses of dried 
roots from peas, clover and other I,eguminoss, to determine the 
amount of nitrogen present, and the results are here given. 



The nitrogen is combined in three forms principally in Albu- 
men, and also in Amides, and Asparagin, as follows: 



Other investigators have obtained as high as 6.94 per cent of 
nitrogen from the dry nodules of peas. 



332 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

The bacteria found in the nodules of various species of Legu- 
minosse, look very similar under the microscope, there being no 
apparent difference; but experiments have proven that there are 
great differences in results obtained with various pure cultures. 



Clover planted in sterilized earth and watered with an infusion 
of the bacteria cultivated from the tubercles of peas, does not,form 
nodules, consequently grows poorly, withers and dies, and the re- 
verse is also true. If peas planted in the sterilized .soil be watered 
with an infusion of bacteria from the tubercles of clover roots.

they soon dry while if the bacteria are taken from the tubercles of 
peas, the growth will be luxuriant under favorable conditions. This 
great similarity of species is not confined to the nitrogen-fixing bac- 
teria ; in our investigation of spoilage in canned vegetables, we have 
met many species which so closely resembled each other as to de- 
ceive us, except in the products elaborated by them when growing 
under certain influences. 

The nitrogen fixing bacteria are soon to receive considerable 
attention in our Agricultural Stations, and some important results 
may be expected in the near future. The very fact that organisms 
which are capable of working up atmospheric nitrogen into nitro- 
genous compounds so necessary for plant life, opens up a means of 
preparing barren wastes for the cultivation of all kinds of fruits 
and vegetables. 

Whenever crops of any plants belonging to the order of Legu- 
minosae are sown, and nitrogen fixing bacteria are introduced in 
pure cultures, there is a wonderful increase of nitrogenous com- 
pounds accumulated in the soil, which enriches it with all the re- 
quirements of plant life in general. This is the reason that ground 
sown in clover is so greatly benefited for the cultivation of farm 
and garden truck in following seasons. 

There are two other species of bacteria present everywhere in 
all kinds of soil, which have a wonderful field of usefulness in sup- 
plying food for plant life, and their work is oxydation of the nitro- 
gen from ammonia, into nitrous acid by one class, and then further 
converting this into nitric acid by the other, thus nitrites are formed 
from ammonia, and nitrates are formed from the nitrites, so they 
have been significantly named — nitrifying bacteria. These two 
classes of bacteria are always present side by side, because the ele- 
ments necessary for the multiplication of the nitrate bacteria are 
formed, of course, by the nitrite micro-organisms. The value of 
manure and decomposing animal and vegetable matter as fertilizers 
lies in the amount of nitrogen which these substances contain, but 
this nitrogen cannot at once be utilizerl by plant life, consequently 
the oxydation processes we have described above, must be accom- 
panied by the nitrifying bacteria. 

The discovery of the nitrifying bacteria was made (in t888) 
by S. Winogradsky, a Russian investigator, who made pure cul- 
tures from soil obtained in various parts of the world, principally 
from Europe, Africa, Japan, Java, Brazil and Quito (Ecuador). 

The soils from these countries contained different species which 
he was able to isolate and grow in pure cultures, not. however, on 
the usual nutritious culture media employed in ordinary bacterio- 
logical work, because the nitrifying bacteria are prototrophic

NITROSOMOXAS IWROPEA, is nearly round, being 
about 0.9 to I At broad, and from 1.2 to 1.8 ft long, and is found in 
European, African and Japanese soil. It is a nitrite bacterium, and 
motile, possessing a single rather short flagellum. It grows in short 
chains of three or four members, and no spore formation has been 
observed. The colonies on silicic acid media, are brown. 

Nitrosomonas Javancnsis, another species, is almost round; is 
motile, having a single flagellum about 30 a* long, which is the 
longest organ of locomotion I have ever seen, being some sixty times 
longer than the cell itself. It grows well on silicic acid medium, 
and the colonies are similar to the bacterium previously described. 
It forms zooglea in liquid cultures, and collects on carbonate of 
magnesium crystals in slimy masses, and disintegrates them. After 
twenty-four hours the germs all drop to the bottom, and the pro- 
duction of nitrites ceases. 

The nitrate bacteria are the organisms which form nitrates 
from the nitrites which result from the action of the nitrosomonas 
just described. They are exceedingly small, and somewhat pear- 



shaped in form, and are able to pass through the pores of the Cham- 
berland filter. 

Winogradsky discovered the nitrate bacteria in the soil always 
where the nitrite bacteria were found, and he gave them the name 
of Nitrobacter. They are not motile, and in liquid cultures form 
a thin mucinous skin which clings firmly to the Hoor and walls of a 
culture flask. No spore formation has been observed, and no divis- 
ion of species has been attempted. 



Plate 106. Green Pea I.ouse 

There are great possibilities in the cultivation of peas in un- 
favorable locations, and it is possible that much larger and better 
crops may be grown in localities where even a fair yield is now 
obtained. There should be extensive experimentai work done, with 
soil inoculated with pure cultures of nitrogen-fixing bacteria and 
the nitrifying bacteria. It is possible for the packers to obtain pure 
culture of these bacteria from the laboratory and distribute them 
among their growers. If these experiments are properly conducted, 
we predict that a verj' large, quick growth of peas may be obtained, 
and that they will be more uniform and more tender and better in 
color than those generally grown for canning purposes. 

The experiments with nitrogen-fixing bacteria have been car- 
ried on by the Agricuhural Department in the Bureau of Plant In- 
dustry for some time by George T. Moore, and the results are en- 
couraging. 

It is not expected that the packers will be able to pursue the 
study and cultivation of these organisms, but if they become inter- 
ested, as they should, and willing to bear the expense of experi- 
menting, it is almost certain to bring good returns for the outlay. 

There are various methods for cultivating peas for canning 
purposes which all growers follow, but it is not within the scope of 
a work of this kind to enter into any elaborate description of agri- 



336 



CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 



cultural subjects. The employment of scientific methods for ob- 
taining good results must ever be interesting to the packer as well 
as the grower. It may be possible to employ bacteriological 
methods for the extermination of such parasites as the pea louse and 
other insects which are so destructive at times. 

PARASITES OF THE PEA PLANT. 

♦There are some parasites which thrive on the leaves, pods, 
and stems of peas belonging to the fungi. Among these are the 
smuts, which produce black patches composed of micro-organisms 
of a higher order than bacteria, but which belong entirely to the 
vegetable kingdom and multiply at the expense of the plant tissue 
and sap. The rusts are also of the same order, and frequently at- 
tack the pods so that large round spots appear all over them, and 
sometimes the tissue is perforated so that bacteria gain access to the 
peas themselves.

The damage done by these fungi is not very serious, however, 
in comparison to insect parasites. The green pea louse (Xectaro- 
phora pisi Kalt) or green fly (so styled by Prof. H. G. Johnson of 
the ^laryland Agricultural College), which made its first appear- 
ance in 1S99. has clone more damage than all other pests known 
to canners. The destruction of peas in 1899, 1900 and 1901 prob- 



•The photographs shown on this subject were taken by Prof. San- 
derson and Prof. Johnson, to whom we are indebted. 



PEAS. 337 

ably amounted to several millions of dollars. The destruction of 
peas was greatest during the season of 1899, particularly of all late 
varieties. The whole Eastern section of this country and Canada, 
wherever peas were grown, .suffered almost total losses ; fields em- 
bracing a hundred acres were devastated as if by fire ; so rapid was 
the multiplication of the insect that it proved utterly impossible to 
save the crops by any spraying or brushing methods known. The 
common method of planting by sowing broadcast had much to do 
with the difficulty of combating the progress of the scourge, be- 
cause there was no room between the vines for brushing and spray- 
ing with kerosene, and soap-suds proved ineffective for the same 
reason, and, also, because the lice bred upon the underside of the 
leaves or between the folds in such a position that a spray could not 
reach them. 

The life history of the green pea fly is not as yet complete, but, 
according to Prof. Johnson, and Prof. J. G. Sanderson (who read 
papers at Detroit, Rochester and Milwaukee), it seems certain that 
the insect is common as a parasite of all plants belonging to the legu- 
menoscC, such as peas, beans, clover, vetch, et al., and may have 
been growing unobserved for many years without having attracted 
any particular attention. I had a most remarkable illustration of its 
reproductive powers on beans, (navy pea beans), which were piled 
in sacks. In some manner, the bottom lavers became wet and were 
not discovered for about a month. The bags had rotted and the 
beans had been attacked by this identical insect, which destroyed 
fully fifty per cent. We swept up fully a barrel full of the dead 
flies which are about 1-32 of an inch long. I also found a few live 
ones, but nearly all seemed to have perished most unaccountably. 
The cause of their destruction I found to be due to a fungus disease 
and will speak of it a little further on. 

The lice are hatched from eggs after the cold weather is over, 
and from that time on until winter, reproduction is carried on by 
the mother flies giving birth to living young. The average life of 
a female flv is a little more than one month and durino: that time she 
will bring into existence about 150 young ones. According to the 
observation of the two gentlemen previously mentioned, there are 
no males among them, although two or three instances pointed to 
their existence. There are, of course, stasres in the life historv of 
the green fly, when the males are in evidence, most likely some time 
in the fall of the year, at which time it is possible that the females 
are made capable of producing j'oung which in their turn receive the 
vital principal from the mother. The many peculiarities of this 
kind familiar to the entomologist do not cause much surprise, be- 
cause nature has endowed many species of insects with wonderful 
powers of reproduction, and other peculiar morphological and bio- 
logical characteristics. 



338 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

It has been demonstrated that cold weather does not kill the 
insect which may be frozen stiff, but after thawing will be as active 
as ever, and is still able to give birth to its young. In certain sec- 
tions of the country, after having been visited with freezing weather 
in December, the insects were found alive after a thaw, and some 
were still observed as late as January on clover. 

There are certain seasons when insect pests of various kinds 
arrive in different parts of the world in innumerable hosts, and de- 
vastate vegetation, but after a time disappear in a manner almost as 
unaccountable as their appearance. Nature has endowed insects 
with wonderful reproductive powers because of their many enemies, 
such as birds, animals, and other insects which feed upon them. It 
js strangely true thkt the enemies of insect life are nearly always 
present in sufficient numbers to prevent scourges, such as those 
which liave destroyed peas during the past few years ; but it some- 
times happens that their greatest enemies are not present in sufficient 
numbers to prevent an overwhelming multiplication. We have 
mentioned birds, animals and other insects as enemies (of the pea 
lice), but the work of extermination by these is as nothing compared 
to that caused by parasites which spread disease among them. 
These parasites may belong to the order of fungi in some cases, 
often they are disease-producing bacteria which attack the vitals and 
reproductive organs of the insects, so that all the young soon die 
after thev are born. 

As an illustration of this truth, we will mention some fungi and 
bacteria, which are parasitic to insects such as silk-worms, bees and 
caterpillars. 

In 1863 to 1865 the whole silk industry of France and Italy 
was almost paralyzed by a disease started among the silk worms, 
which deprived them of their power to spin cocoons. Pasteur un- 
dertook the task of discovering the cause, and found that a disease, 
which was called Pcbrhie, of bacterial origin, had spread so rapidly 
and affected the moth w-orms and eggs to such an extent that there 
seemed little hopex)f saving the industry. He retired from the 
world and began his investigations, which resulted in his being able 
to detect the disease in the moth. He would permit a moth to de- 
posit her eggs on a small linen cloth, then he would crush her body 
in a mortar with a small quantity of water. A microscopical ex- 
amination would reveal the presence of corpuscular matter perhaps, 
and the remains together with the eggs were destroyed. Wlienever 
a moth was found to be perfectly free from the bacteria her eggs 
were carefully set aside for use and in this manner the healthy 
worms were again cultivated. 

From the diseased eggs, pupre and moths have been cultivated, 
shining oval micrococci, 2 to 3 jn long, 2 fi wide, and rods 2,^ fi 



broad and 5 n long, which are the cause of Pcbrine and Gatttne and 
are named by Lebert ( Panhistophyton ovatimi). Streptococcus 
bombvcis, are oval cocci occtiring in chains and pairs, which cause a 
disease among silkworms called {Flncheric) . which causes them to 
cease feeding and become putrid. 

Honey bees are sometimes attacked by a disease called foul- 
brood, which is quite common in this country. The disease attacks 
the larvw, is contagious and causes them to die, putrefy, and turn 
dark brown in color. The cells containing diseased larvae may be 
detected easily by the dark cappings. Foul-brood is a disease caused 
by Bacillus Alvei — rods varying in size which form large oval 
spores. The bacteria are actively motile. 

An infectious disease called Caterpillars' Disease, has been ob- 
served among their larvx. The bacteria causing their destruction 
are Cocci united in pairs and chains.

Returning to the green fly so destructive lo pea vines, we find 
a number of natural enemies which feed upon them. There is a tly 
considerably smaller than the green lice, which lay eggs upon their 
bodies and when these hatch they feed upon and destroy the lice 
themselves and use their bodies as shelter until they are transformed 
into flies, when they emerge through openings made themselves 
and seek out other green lice as hosts for their eggs. Large num- 
bers of pea lice are thus exterminated. 



340 



CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 



Even more destructive to the pea lice are the maggots of the 
syrphus flies, of which there are three or four varieties. These flies 
are beautifully banded and lay their eggs among the colonies of 
lice, for instinct leads them to provide a suitable food location for 
the newly hatched maggots, accordingly when they hatch they begin 
to feed upon the thriving colony of lice surrounding them, and the 
numbers required for nourishment very soon depletes the colony. 

These maggots or worms, s.) often seen among the pea vines, are 
green or brown in color, about a half inch in length. They have no 
legs nor head apparently, but are provided with two powerful hook^ 
with which thev seize the lice, and hold them while thev suck the 
fluid from their bodies. 




Fig. 32 

The lady-bird beetles, of which there are several varieties, find 
in the pea lice a suitable article of diet, but since they do not come 
out in force until June, are a litlle late to be as beneficial as the mag- 
gots of the syrphus fly. The larvt-e hatch out from small yellow 
eggs. They have six legs and attain a length of half an inch, when 
thev attach themselves to a leaf and in a little more than a week are 
transformed into beetles. The larvae and beetles both feed upon the 
pea lice, and consume large numbers. 





Fig. 33 

There are numerous other insects which feed uj^on the pests, but 
do not flourish in sufiicient numbers to materially check the spread 
of the lice where they have gained much headway. Among these 
must be mentioned the Iacc-iK,'iiigcd flics. They are quite green in 
color, the shade resembling the peas. 

The wings are quite beautiful, being very thin, showing the fine 
net work of veins which break up the sunlight into prismatic colors. 



They are sometimes termed the "golden-eyed flies," because the eyes 
are bright golden color. The eggs are deposited on the leaves singly 
on a stalk of fine silk, which prevents the larvie from feeding upon 
the unhatched eggs which they would surely do. Often the larger 
ones will feed upon the weaker, unless sufficient food is available. 
They move quite freely and consume large numbers of Uce, grasp- 
ing them in their two curved jaws, then sucking the fluids. A 
single lace-winged fly will lay about fifty eggs a day and the hatched 
larvas one week later are busy with the lice. 

By far the most important enemy of the green pea louse is 
fungous disease which is microscopical. This fungus is brown mold 
called Bntomopltithora aphidis, and almost covers the bodies of the 



Plate lO!'. Lace Winged Fly

lice. It enters the tissue, absorbing the moisture, and causes the 
insects to shrivel up and die. The disease is contagious and spreads 
rapidly, carrying off more lice than all other enemies combined. It 
is safe to say that fungoid diseases among insects are the means of 
preventing their spread, since they breed so very fast that ordinary 
insect enemies could hardly keep pace with them. But as soon as 
a disease breaks out the organs of reproduction are deprived of their 
functions aiul the check is generally complete. Some of these fung- 
ous diseases are difificult to cultivate artificially, but there is surely 



342 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PR0DirCT3. 

a method which can easily be disco\'ered, since all the conditions nec- 
essary for the preparation of nutrient media are obtainable. This 
is a field for investigation and we believe it both possible and nec- 
essary for research work to be done, to check any such spread of in- 
sects as was experienced by growers of peas in the three years so 
well remembered by us all. This research work may be carried on. 
and means discovered for cultivating the disease fungi in large num- 
bers on artificial nutrient media. When cultures are obtainable 
water may be used to carry the spores into all parts of fields where 
the lice are flourishing and thus spread disease among them, which 
means quick extermination. 



Plate 110 

Eggs at Lace Winged Fly and P?a Lire Killed b>- Fungous Disease. 

There is no doubt but that in certain seasons the weather con- 
ditions are such that disease molds will not grow naturally, but if 
cultures are kept in our laboratory from one year to another, we 
have the means of starting the disease among the lice ourselves, 
and need not depend directly upon nature. There is considerable 
expense connected with research work of this kind, but its import- 
ance is^so great that packers and those interested in growing peas 
should take a lively interest in lending all necessary support. 



PEAS. 343 

CHEMICAL COMPOSITION AND FOOD VALUE OF PEAS. 

Few people realize the great nutritive value of peas. We have 
mentioned in preceding pages that peas belong to the order of Lcgu- 
niinosae, and are included under the name of Pulses, to which belong 
also pea beans, and all other varieties of beans, lentils, and pea-nuts. 
These varieties of food are extremely rich in nitrogen, which, as 
we have mentioned, is due to the absorption of nitrogen from the 
atmosphere through the agency of minute organisms which have 
the power of fixing free nitrogen and reducing it to nitrates, which 
are soluble elements, quickly taken up by the plants belonging to this 
group. This is accomplished, as we have described, by bacteria 
which form the nodules on the roots of the plants, so we would nat- 
urally expect the fruit of these plants to be veritable "store houses'* 
of nitrogen. Almost all of this nitrogen is in a proteid form, and 
by Church's analyses there is only 3 to 5 per cent of the total nitro- 
gen which is not in proteid form, and on account of this characteris- 
tic the vegetables belonging to family of pulses have been named 
"the poor man's beef." 

The proteid so valuable as a food in peas is Icgiunin, which is 
a casein-like substance resembling the casein of milk. Sulphur is 
a large ingredient of the proteids of peas, and gives rise to sulphur- 
etted hydrogen, especially when fermentative and putrefactive pro- 
cesses are carried on by bacteria. This gas is also liberated dur- 
ing digestive processes, probably due to the presence of putrefac- 
tive bacteria in the intestines. The presence of potash and lime in 
the composition of peas and other pulses sometimes causes calcifi- 
cation of arteries among strict vegetarians. 

The green garden pea is particularly rich in carbohydrates, 
and some varieties have a very large per cent of sugar ; other vari- 
eties contain very little, which has tempted some canners to use sac- 
charin. We have explained this custom under the head of food 
preservatives and their detection. There is frequently a loss of car- 
bohydrates in the blanching and processing of peas, and the addition 
of granulated sugar really adds to their food value. 

Since peas contain so little fat they are really improved by 
the addition of pure butter, and I throw out this hint, which may 
prove valuable to any packer who is searching for specialties. We 
all know that pork or bacon adds wonderfully to the taste, flavor, 
and nutritive value of beans, and peas contain less than half as much 
fat as beans, consequently the nutrient value may be greatly in- 
creased by the addition of a fatty substance, such as butter. We 
find that canned peas heated and spread with butter are delicious, 
or if the liquor is prepared with butter and pepper and then poured 
over the peas, they are very greatly improved in flavor. The addi- 
tion of cream or milk also serves the same purpose, and supplies the 



344 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

necessary fats in a digestible form, a preparation much esteemed by 
many persons. The addition of butter to canned peas before steril- 
ization is practicable, because the same sterilization which is re- 
quired for peas will also answer for the added butter: but milk 
would recjuire a stronger process, which would cook the peas to 
pieces, and the result would be something like pea soup, instead of 
canned peas. 

The blanching of peas before filling into the cans is a most 
important feature of their preparation. In the blanching bath the 
slimy products formed by bacteria are washed away, and besides this 
a bitter substance, which is a natural component, is dissolved and 
freed from the peas. This bitter principle is easily detected by tast- 
ing a finely divided raw pea. Just what it is I am unable to say, 
but it is comparable to the principle found in aloes, quassia, and 
other bitter vegetables and barks. The same bitter principle is a 
common product of several species of bacteria, some of which have 
been isolated from bitter canned peas. Frequent changing of the 
water used for blanching is advisable, because this bitter principle 
is dissolved from the peas and although it is volatile to some ex- 
tent, win, in time so affect the water that the blanching will not 
be efifective. 

The blanching process has some disadvantages, too. There 
seems to be no w-ay of avoiding the loss of a certain per cent of pro- 
teid and mineral matter, also sugars, but the loss is inconsiderable. 
There is more loss of these substances from dried peas, which are 
sometimes put to soak for several hours. Such peas are made up 
into special food products, the formulae being proprietary. 

Of course, the same loss is explained in the preparation of 
soaked canned peas," a brand which should never be manufac- 
tured, because they are extremely poor in quality and their presence 
in the tra le injures the pea-packing industry. 

To show the composition of peas in comparison with some 
other pulses I have prepared a table of analyses of solids. Of course, 
the great bulk of the raw and cooked product is water, which in 
peas amounts to 78 to 79 per cent, and in haricots and scarlet run- 
ners to 75 and 91 per cent respectively.

We see by these analyses that the proteid is very large, also 
the carbohydrates, which make peas of great nutritive value. About 
one and a half pounds of dry peas would supply the daily require- 
ment of proteid for an average man, and the energy liberated, 
weight for weight, is greater than white bread, beef, eggs or milk. 

The relative cost of peas as compared with these foods is only 
about one-half, taking as a standard the amount of energy liberated, 
bread only being excepted. Now the people do not realize these 
facts and need education, so the thought which suggests itself is 
for the packer of peas to advertise them in such a way as to attract 
the masses who are spending far too much money for meat, eggs and 
other 'foods to obtain the energy required for their existence. If 
the people receive this information there is no doubt that greater 
demand for canned peas will follow. 

There are great possibilities for specialties in which peas may 
form the base. We have already mentioned pea soup and special 
combinations with a sauce containing butter and seasoning, and 
there are, no doubt, other combinations which may be tried by ex- 
perimenting, and which would doubtless prove to be good sellers. 
This is a field for the genius, but the genius usually strikes the sue 
cessful combinations by constant experimental work. Experi- 
mental work, let me say, is one of the best paying investments. 
Nearly all of the most profitable lines of specialties have been 
worked out by the firms who are constantly experimentino: to ob- 
tain combinations which are attractive, both in price and quality, and 
strange to say the popular specialties are combinations which have 
as a base some well known standard article of food. 

Popular specialties have been made with wheat, oats, corn, 
beans, etc., combined with other materials, or worked up into modi- 
fied conditions entirely new. and they have become popular because 
they possess real nutritive value and are palatable. 

There is too little experimental work done by the canner: he 
is solely occupied with the idea of packing a full crop of certain pro- 
ducts, sometimes never dreaming that these very products could pos- 
sibly be made into new and attractive specialties, which might yield 
him two or three times the profit derived from the regular standard 
goods. 



346 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

By proper advertising and adhering strictly to fine quality the 
sales of canned peas could be greatly increased. Within a year 
there may be means discovered which will enable the farmers to 
grow peas of fine flavor and suitable size, even in localities where 
there has been little or no success with them in the past. We refer 
here to the means of inoculating the seed and soil with the nitrogen 
bacteria described in the previous pages. When these experiments 
are complete there will be more peas packed and many factories will 
be able to pack them, even in places which seem most unfavorable. 

PLANTING AND CANNING PEAS. 

The old method of planting peas in rows and picking the pods 
by hand, the pickers having to go over the same vines a number 
of times, has been discontinued. The old method was expensive 
and the results were not always as perfect as the more modern 
methods. Peas are now sown the same as small grain, in drills, 
and there is appointed a man of good judgment who visits the fields 
and inspects the crops regularly, keeping well posted on the progress 
shown. He examines the vines and when he finds that the pods 
are filled with peas that are about right in the average, he orders 
them to be cut and hauled to the vining machines promptly on 
wagons, much after the manner of hauling hay or straw. Of 
course, the planting of peas is done at difterent times so that all 
will not mature at once, which would result in either overworking 
the factory or the peas would get too old. Xot all of the peas are 
fully matured in a field ready for cutting, judgment is exercised and 
they are declared ready when the average is the best, preferably 
when the small sizes are plentiful, because these bring the best 
prices and are sweeter and better in flavor and color than the large 
sizes. The mowing machines are similar to those used for cutting 
wheat, oats or hay, and the vines and pods are hauled on wagons, 
as we have said, to the vining machines, which should be near the 
factorv. 

The vining machines beat out the peas, which are received in 
baskets and then taken to the cleaners, where various mechanical 
means are employed to free them from dirt, pieces of pods, and 
leaves. Usually this cleaning is done by means of a blast of air 
which blows away these undesirable things, or suction is employed 
to hold back everything excepting the peas as they roll over the 
screens. This does away with considerable dirt and other things 
and the peas are quickly taken to the grading machines which are 
long cylinders perforated the entire length, the holes being just the 
proper diameter to let the particular sizes fall through, first verv 
small and then increasing up to the largest size, and the size which 
cannot go through any of the holes is caught at the end. The 



PEAS. 347 

proper grading of peas is very important. Great uniformity is de- 
manded by the trade, and this is sometimes a difficult matter to ac- 
complish, if the peas are not hurried after tliey are cut. If there is 
any shrinkage, of course, peas which are too large will pass in 
among the small sizes and afterwards will swell, and spoil the uni- 
formity. Some packers divide their ])eas into six or seven sizes, 
others into four or five, which is generally enough. 

• 

CANNING PEAS. 

From the graders the peas should be fed on to a linen belt, 
which moves slowly past the girls who are employed to pick out the 
imperfect or off-colored peas, also small pieces of hulls or leaves 
which have succeeded in passing through the cleaner and frader. 
These girls should wear some protection for their hair, to avoid the 
possibility of getting any stray hairs among the peas. Such an ac- 
cident is not easily forgiven if the purchaser should be so unfortun- 
ate as to find one. There should be a rule in every canning factory 
stipulating that all the female employees wear caps or some other 
protection for the hair. Accidents are not uncommon and the in- 
jury done to the w^hole industry is far-reaching. 

Some packers prefer to have the hand-picking done after the 
blanching, because the blanching brings out the colors prominently, 
and there may be some difference in sizes, too, which will be more 
apparent after the peas have passed through the water. If there 
are any which were shrunken they will swell up to their normal size, 
and if any of the yellow seed varieties which are too old, the yellow 
color will be more noticeable after the blanching. All these things 
which interfere with perfect uniformity, may be corrected at this 
time. 

There are several points worthy of consideration at this place. 
If the peas are right in the beginning, it is preferable to sort them 
before the blanching, because it is wise to fill them into the cans rap- 
idly after they have once been partially cooked, so it should always 
be a matter of prime importance to see that the peas are harvested 
in time and then put through the viners before they become heated. 
The custom of some packers, who store the vines in sheds and allow 
the lactic acid bacteria and the spore-bearing micro-organisms to 
start decomposition, with its attendant liberation of heat, is alto- 
gether wrong. Such peas must deteriorate rapidly, and the sorting 
or picking must necessarily be done after the blanching. One 
packer sent me a number of samples of peas taken from various piles 
which were spoiled, the liquor being muddy, and in some cases the 
contents were entirelv sour. He states that his viners became over- 
crowded and it became necessarv for him to fill his sheds; the re- 
suit was that they became heated, necessitating careful sorting after 



348 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

the blanching process. There was considerable delay during the 
sorting, because of the many bad peas, pieces of slimy pods and 
leaves. He did not increase his process, but maintained his tem- 
perature at a point just sufficient for sterilizing strictly fresh peas, 
and the result of it was, as we have stated, a very bad lot of peas. 
Should it become necessary at any time to do the sorting after the 
blanching, do it as rapidly as possible, having a sufficient force in 
order to avoid the delavs so common. 

The old blanching method was to have a number of small tanks 
filled with water, and beside each a tank filled wMth cold water. 
Sulphate of copper was used by many to fix the green color, and 
alum was used to toughen the skin of the peas. The peas were im- 
mersed in the hot water containing the chemicals mentioned and, 
'after about five minutes' cooking, were rinsed in the cold water, then 
filled into cans. 

The modern method is better because the chemicals are not 
used and the blanching is done automatically, the peas being carried 
through three baths by means of worm conveyors, or spirals, which 
are large enough to carry the peas through the water in a steady, 
regular manner. The water in tank No. 3 cleans the mucinous 
matter from the peas, and is attached with the overflow from tank 
No. 2. The second tank receives the overflow from No. i, so all 
are constantly flowing, keeping the water comparatively free from 
dirt, slime and other matter. After the blanchinsf a cold water 
spray is used to give the peas firmness and to prevent them from 
becoming heated. 

SOUR PKAS. 

Sour peas in many cases are due to careless methods before 
the sterilizing process, and a few words on this subject at this time 
will serve the packer and enable him to avoid the causes. When 
peas get sour prior to the sterilizing process, the acidity is generally 
due to organisms which belong to the Lactic Acid Group, and these 
germs attack the carbohydrates, converting the sugar into lactic acid 
without the evolution of gas sometimes. C,;Hj20j; = 2C3Hg03. 

One molecule sugar = 2 molecules lactic acid. 

One germ is rather small, occuring generally in pairs, some- 
times in chains, but most frequently in bunches or zooglaeae forms. 
It is exceedingly small, measuring only i to 2.8 fi long and 0.3 to 
0.4 fi wide. Some writers claim to have discovered spores in this 
shining species but the spots which are sometimes visible within the 
cells. They are not true spores and do- not produce vegetating 
forms, so we call them spore-like bodies, which are destroyed at 
boiling temperature. 







There is a spore bearing bacillus wliich breaks up invert sugar 
into lactic acid, in fact tbere is a large number of bacteria which 
produce lactic acid. 

These germs are present in large numbers on all growing vtg- 
etables and universally distributed in air, water and soil. They 
^row well at temperatures ranging from loo to 120° F., and the 
"sweating" so often seen in hay. fodder, ensilage and pea vines, 
when piled in heaps, is partly due to the lactic acid bacteria. There 
are, however, a number of bacteria which produce lactic acid, and 
this acid being quite sour, imparts that characteristic to any food 
product susceptible to lactic fermentation. 



When pea vines are-t)iled up in heaps, the "sweating process" 
begins quite soon, and within a few hours large quantities of sugar 
and starch have imdergone chemical changes, with the formation of 
considerable lactic acid. There arc usually a number of organisms 
at work at the same time. Some of these belong to the class of 
heat-loving bacteria, and by their united action on the cellulose and 
proteids. tlie temperature if often elevated to 120 degrees F.. when 
the juices are freed, and the so-called "sweating process" is tn be

There is no part of tlie prnccs; of |>ea-c.uming which affords 
so much danger of sour goods as.the sweating of the vines and pods, 
so tbere is danger of allowing the raw material to accunmlate too

far ahead of the machines. A large per cent of the spoilage cases 
of peas investigated in the laboratory have been due to souring 
which happened prior to the sterilizing process. Our readers will 
recall the great trouble experienced from sour peas after the viners 
were first enstalled. I do not wish to throw^ anv reflection whatever 
upon the viners, because I believe that they are splendid inventions, 
but the factories were not properly equipped for handling peas by 
this system. The packers in many cases had not planned for the 
increased receipts of raw material, and the consequence was that the 
vines were cut too fast. If the viners were operated at their full 
capacity, the hulled peas would pile up ahead of the other machinery, 
so that by the time the peas were finally sealed in the cans, they had 
undergone marked chemical changes, the carbohydrates or sug-ars 
having for the most part been converted into lactic acid, and in some 
cases bitter compounds had formed, together with butyric and fatty 
acids, all due to the action of bacteria of various species. 

One peculiarity of sour peas is that it is impossible to tell by 
the appearance of the cans that they are sour: the cans appear to 
be all right and have the usual vacuum, which draws in the ends, 
and do not swell. Very often this is the case, although not always, 
because souring without the formation of gas may result from im- 
perfect sterilization; but in the great majority of cases this takes 
place prior to the sterilizing process. 

From the very fact that appearance of sour goods gives no in- 
dication of the trouble, the cans may be scattered throughout the 
piles and cause a great deal of dissatisfaction when they reach the 
trade. The question is frequently asked : '*How will I be able to 
pick out the sour cans so that I may avoid trouble with the trade?" 
I will give you a feU' practical hints which may serve you, should 
you be so unfortunate as to permit your goods to get sour. Xearly 
all fatty acids are volatile to some extent, and if heated pass into 
a gaseous state, although not completely, and after cooling will 
again become liquid, but sometimes quite slowly: now we can take 
advantage of this physiological characteristic and heat our cans in 
boiling water until the ends of all are swelled, then by applying cold 
water the cans whose ends draw in rapidly are good, while those 
whose ends draw in slowly are probably all sour. To do this ex- 
peditiously, place the cans in crates which hold only a single row of 
cans, then turn the bottoms upward, then lower into open bath of 
boiling water and heat until the ends of all the cans swell completely. 
Do not heat long enough to cook the peas, because the tender peas 
may become too soft and dissolve in the liquor, thus making it tur- 
bid or cloudy. After the ends are all swelled, lift the crate from the 
boiling water into a tank of cold running water, just deep enough to 
be entirely submerged. In a short time the ends of the good cans 



PEAS. 353 

will respond to the vacuum produced, and will snap back, while 
those cans which contain volatile or fatty acids will remain swelled 
for perhaps thirty minutes to one hour. Of course some good cans 
will not draw in rapidly, especially if they had been somewhat chilled 
before seaHng; the vacuum in this case would be quite weak and 
of course would not respond quickly to the chilling, in the process 
previously described. It is not always possible, therefore, to save 
every good can by this method, but if due care and judgment are 
exercised, all sour cans may be detected and removed. Sour peas 
cannot be made good. They are a loss and should be dumped. 

The "sweating" previously described is not the only source of 
sour peas. There is no stage of the process where delays are so 
dangerous as after the blanching. Bacteria as a rule are true scav- 
engers and invade partially cooked material rapidly. The cooking 
which the peas received in the blanching is attended with a certain 
loss of carbohydrates and proteid., and the liberation of natural 
juices and softening of cellulose, so they afford a rich soil for the 
development of bacteria. Furthermore, the heating softened the 
spores of the heat-resisting bacteria, which rapidly develop into 
vegetating rods, forms which produce the remarkable changes so 
often noticed in canned goods. 

During any of the delays occuring after the blanching, the 
danger of souring is great, so it is always preferable to do the sort- 
ing prior to the blanching. Delays sometimes happen where the 
peas are filled into cans, and at the capping machines, where great 
stacks of cans are piled up. Like all automatic devices, these ma- 
chines sometimes get out of order, and considerable time is lost 
making changes or repairs, so it is advisable to have extra machines 
to avoid the delays as much as possible, in order to prevent souring 
of the peas at these times. 

The blanching of peas should vary in length of time according 
to size, the small peas should receive less cooking than the large 
sizes, the time varying from five to ten minutes. 

Some successful packers use alum in the blanching to harden 
the skin of the peas, and I do not see any objection to it. It is 
hardly likely that the employment of alum for this purpose would 
be condemned by food commissioners as illegal, and while its em- 
ployment is not absolutely necessary, nevertheless it does prevent 
the cracking of the skins, and will insure a mtich clearer liquor for 
that reason. 

The filling of peas into the cans was formerly done by hand by 
the aid of small funnels, and the perfection of automatic devices for 
Recently, machinery for this purpose has been made which accom- 
plishes the filling with great uniformity, giving better average re- 
sults than hand filling. One bushel of peas fills about fifteen No. 2 
cans, approximately. 



354 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

The filling of peas into the cans is important; the cans must 
open up full, but care must be taken not to fill them too full because 
the peas will crack open in the sterilizing process. 

After the cans are filled with peas, enough weak brine is ackled 
to cover them. The brine may be filled bv machinery — an attach- 
ment for this purpose is usually connected with the pea filler. The 
brine is made by dissolving about six pounds of salt in forty gal- 
lons of water. Some packers use a small quantity of saccharin to 
sweeten the peas. Eight pounds of granulated sugar added to the 
brine gives splendid results. 

The brine should be made quite clear, and where filtered water 
is available it is to be preferred, although well or spring water is 
very good. The water used for all canned goods should be pure 
and clear, surface water and the muddy water so often seen in larg-e 
cities, which obtain their supply from rivers, is not desirable, unless 
properly filtered. Water which may be contaminated from sewage 
or decomposing vegetable matter, so often seen in the vicinity of 
canning factories, should not be used, because it may contain pro- 
ducts elaborated by bacteria which may injure canned goods. ^Iuch 
of the salt sold on the market is impure, containing much foreign 
matter, so it is advisable to pay a little more and obtain the refined 
table salt, which with pure water ought to give a clear brine. 
Granulated sugar is to be preferred to ordinary light brown sugars, 
because it will stand the process without any burnt sugar flavor. 
During some seasons, and in some localities, the peas are sufficiently 
sweet witliout the addition of sugar, but ordinarily a little sugar 
adds greatly to the quality of peas. 

MUDDY LIQUOR. 

Muddy liquor is so often the occasion of losses that I will ex- 
plain some of the causes which have come to my notice. The phe- 
nomenon is usually noticeable a few days after processing; in some 
cases it is seen as soon as the cans are processed. If we examine 
the peas which have stood for some time before blanching, we will 
notice that they are quite sticky. This viscid matter is due to the 
action of bacteria, and is the product formed by the growth of the 
germs on the carbohydrates and proteids. One of the principle 
agents is Bacillus mesentericus vulgatus. an organism first found 
on potatoes, for which reason it is sometimes called the "potato ba- 
cillus.'' It is, however, a widespread variety and is present in 
water, soil, and on the leaves, pods, stems and roots of nearly all 
vegetables. 

Bacillus mesentericus vulgatus is a thick bacillus, measuring 
from V2 ft to 3.5 /A in length, straight, with ends somewhat round, 
actively motile when young, due to numerous flagella which grow

al! over the surface. It grows singly, often in pairs and short 
chains, and soon gives rise to spores which are quite resistant to 
heat. Wlien cultivated on agar, the colonies are at first almost 
transparent, becoming bluish white and gradually extend, growing 



356 CANNING AND PRB3BRVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

more opaque and wrinkled. The streak culture is a dirty white, and 
spreads rapidly over the whole surface, forming slime rapidly. On 
gelatin the growth is rapid, and liquefaction takes place along the 
entire line. It is aerobic and facultative anaerobic and grows well 
at room temperature, but most rapidly at loo to 105° F., in which 
lemiwratures it forms spores very fast, and these are located near 
the center of the rods. After spores begin to form, the cells slowly 
dissolve into a slimy mass cementing the surrounding spores to- 
gether. We have succeeded in photographing them thus as iridi- 
catetl in plate 46. 

The slime produced by this organism Is so mucinous that it 
may be drawn out into long threads by dipping the platimun loop 
into a growth on agar. 

As may be imagined by our readers, it is quite difficult to ob- 
tain a sHde preparation sufficiently free from slime to demonstrate 
by staining the flagella or organs of locomotion as shown in plate

114; but it may be done by inoculating a test tube of bouillon, and 
after a growth is obtained, the surface of agar is streaked with 
a small platinum loopful of the culture. Within six hours a thin, 
almost transparent film will be seen to be extending over the sur- 
face, and from the edge of this a growth of the bacilli sufficiently 
young and free from slime may be obtained for the demonstration 
of fiagella. 



When the mucinous matter forms on the peas, it cannot be 
entirely removed in the blanching bath, because the cellulose or 
fibre has been softened and the bacteria have gained entrance to 
the interior, so during the final processing this matter, together 
with the mealy substance of the peas, is diffused throughout the 
liquor which, of course, gives it a muddy appearance. 

As we have explained in previous pages, the sweating pro- 
cesses either among the vines or shelled peas are the chief causes of 
souring, so also they are the chief causes of muddy liquor. 

There is another bacillus which produces butyric acid, and is 
strictly anaerobic, which condition is produced in the center of 
heated vines and peas, the oxygen being all utilized by the bacteria 
on the surface of the mass. This organism resembles bacillus 
butyricus amylobactcr. but seems to differ from it in spore for- 
mation. It is actively motile in the vegetative state, having num- 
erous flagella.

I found this bacillus in the central portions of a basket of 
shelled peas which had stood over night. There was a perceptible 
odor of normal butyric acid, and the peas were quite hot and slimy. 
The organism did not grow in the Petri dishes, so I inoculated a 
small test tube, and tried the pyrogallate method, described in 
Chapter III, for the cultivation of anaerobic bacteria. The organ- 
ism grew quite well, and is about 2 f long and 9.7 p. in breadth, 
giving rise to terminal spores verj- much resembling Bacillus 



358 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

Tetani, which is the cause of lockjaw, described in Chap. II. (See 
Plate 27.) The spores were not so near the end of the rods, how- 
ever, some being near the center, but generally pretty close to the 
end. See Plate 48. 

This organism rapidly softened the cellulose and the skins of 
the peas became quite soft. I used the utmost care in blanching, 
and filled the cans with filtered brine, but after the sterilizing pro- 
cess the liquor was very muddy and viscid. The inside of the peas 
was soft and became diffused throughout the contents of the cans, 
so I had pretty good evidence that the bacillus in question was the 
cause. Frankel and Pfeiffer isolated an organism very similar to 
this from a rotten melon, and Omelianski describes an anaerobic 
bacillus having terminal spores which softened cellulose, produced 
butyric acid, carbonic acid and hydrogen corresponding closely to 
this organism found in the peas. 

There are other varieties seen in bacteriological examinations, 
which produce changes of this kind, set free volatile and fatty acids, 
and impart unpleasant flavors to peas which are allowed to stand 
exposed, so we call particular attention to the necessity of quick 
w^ork between the cutting of the vines, and the sterilizing process. 

Another cause of muddy liquor in cans of peas is due to over- 
filling the cans with peas. We should always bear in mind that 
peas swell some during sterilization, and if filled too closely will 
pack and this causes the skins to burst, permitting the mealy parts 
of the peas to become diffused throughout the contents. This is 
a feature of pea packing not generally known among canners, so 
I desire to call particular attention to the fact that the cans must 
not be filled too full of peas. This difficulty is obviated by the 
employment of modern filling machines and is not so common as it 
was in the days of hand filling. The measures in the machities 
should be set to hold just enough peas, so that the cans will be 
filled up to three-quarters of an inch from the top. 

Overprocessing is another cause of muddy or cloudy liquor. 
If the peas are cooked to pieces, of course, the liquor will not be 
clear. To properly sterilize the peas without cooking them to 
pieces requires more judgment than any other step in the process 
of pea packing. There are so many sizes, all requiring different 
time, and the nature of the peas must also be taken into considera- 
tion — some varieties requiring longer time than others. 

Another cause of clouded liquor is imperfect sterilization, and 
by that I mean that all bacteria are not destroyed. There are 
some bacteria which have spores of great resisting powers against 
heat, and if they are not destroyed will develop in the cans where 
the sterilizing process is insufficient. Swelled cans usually result, 
but there are some varieties of bacteria which do not produce gas 






PEAS. 359 

when growing in some substances and canned peas seem to favor 
this phenomenal characteristic. 

As a rule these bacteria produce volatile and fatty acids which 
expand when the cans are heated, but at ordinary temperatures 
there is no outward indication that the contents have undergone 
chemical changes. Such cans of peas are sour, of course, and the 
litjuor is clouded, because it is the culture medium for these bac- 
teria. Sour peas, due to imperfect sterilization, are exceptional, 
because, as I have said, the cans more often swell ; but I have seen 
a few cases. 

When the sterilization process is not complete, it generally 
happens that swells result, but this is not always the case. There 
are a number of bacteria which may cause souring without the gen-

eration of any gas. Some bacteria which produce gas when grow- 
ing in some goods do not produce it when growing in other goods. 

The anaerobic bacteria generally produce much gas, and the 
extremely foul odors present in swelled cans of peas are ordinarily 
due to them, while the souring is more frequently cau.sed by germs 
which are aerobic and facultative anaerobic. Some of these, how- 
ever, form sulphuretted hydrogen which has a very unpleasant 
odor. 

When sterilization is incomplete the spores are not killed and 
after a short time they begin to vegetate, utilizing elements neces- 
sary for their growth — viz., carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen,

etc, and these elements are obtained by breaking up the molecules 
containing them, causing marked clicmical changes most noticeable 
in the sugar or carbohydrates. The sugar is broken up and there 
are formed various acids or alkalies according to the nature of the 
organisms at work. 

Lactic acid is found by a large number of bacteria, and this 
is one of the chief products which gives peas a very sour taste. In

nearly all cases of souring the liquor becomes quite muddy, often 
viscous. Slime is formed by several species belonging to the well- 
known aerobic spore-bearing bacteria. I have seen the liquor on 
canned peas so slimy that threads more than a yard long could be 
drawn out of the cans by dipping a platinum wire into the juice and 
slowly drawing it out. The organism at work in this case was 
Bacillus Megatherium. 

This organism was first discovered by De Bary on boiled cab- 
bage, but is quite common and widespread on various vegetables. 
It is a bacillus having round ends, quite large, being 5 to 6 ft long 
and about 2.5 /a thick. It forms chains of several members, and 
when stained in a certain way may show segments (see Plate 118) 
or division lines, so that a single bacillus will appear to be composed 
of three or four members, which is indeed the case, each one hav- 
ing the power to grow out into the long form so that a chain will 
result, looking something like sausages. When forming spores 
the cells are nearly filled (see plate 120) and the cell seems to dis- 
solve away, leaving a somewhat smaller spore than we would ex- 
pect to see. These spores are quite resistant to heat and are able 
to stand boiling for some time. The special character of megath- 
erium is that it is slowly motile, although possessing numerous 
flagella, produces cloudiness and slime, forms abundant sulphur- 
etted hydrogen, has no indol reaction and forms spores rapidly. 

The peas which contained this organism had been processed 
for 25 minutes at 240° F. Many of the cans were swelled and in 
some of these I found the butyric acid bacteria described in previous 
pages. Another case of sour peas caused by insufficient steriliza- 
tion came to my notice some time ago when the party had filled 
his retorts with water to a certain height and then attempted to 
process them with a steam supply at the top (instead of the bottom) 
of the retorts. Of course, all the peas below the surface of the 
water soured, and the most of them swelled. One peculiar feature 
of this case was a complete bleaching out of all the natural color of 
the peas ; the chlorophyl had succumbed to the sulphur gas formed 
in the can. This gas had been generated by a certain species of 
anaerobic bacteria. 

In the sour peas, of which there were quite a number, I iso- 
lated one which had produced considerable formic acid, also a 
slight per cent succinic acid. This organism was quite motile and 
did not form spores. It had numerous flagella and when grown on 
the surface of nutrient agar produced a beautiful red color. This 
was bacillus prodigiosus and under certain conditions grows won- 
derfully, sometimes giving oflf the odor of herring brine. It does 
not form spores, as we have said, consequently is easily destroyed. 
The process, therefore, was very ineffective where this can had 



362 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

stood in the retort. The can must have been among those at the 
bottom. We have described this organism pretty fully under the 
head of chromogenic bacteria, chapter II, 

One can which I examine<l showed a very clouded liquor, but 
was not so shmy. The peas in this can were quite firm and had 
a rather raw taste, due to insufficient cooking. An examination of 
the liquor showed the presence of very motile bacteria, some of 
which were extremely long. Even the longest of them had a ser- 
pentine motion, so I made inoculations in agar and put the dishes 
in the incubator for development of colonies.

On the following day small, irregular, shining white colonies 
made their appearance and grew rapidly, sending out little hair-like 
threads in all directions, visible when magnified about fifty times. 
A thin, almost transparent bluish film soon spread rapidly to the 
walls of the dish. From the edge of thi.s film I obtained a speci- 
men for staining flagella. The organism has all the characteristics 
of Bacillus Subtilis, or the Hay Bacillus. 

After two days the culture began forming spores which are 
located near the center of the rods. These spores, when inocu- 
lated into good cans of peas, produced the same cloudiness seen in 
the original can from which the colonies were isolated. The spores 
are quite large and seem to have a very thick membranous wall, as 
shown in the plate. The walls of the spores take the stain well. 



PEAS. 363 

while the center of the spores remains uncolored. The dye is not 
able to penetrate to the center, although heated for some time di- 
rectly over a flame until steam arose from the cover glass. This 
organism and those similar to it are among the great heat-resist- 
ing bacteria, requiring fully ten minutes* exposure to 250° F. be- 
fore being devitalized. 

The question is often asked, "How long shall I process my 
peas so they will keep?'' This cannot be answered in a manner to 
cover all conditions and sizes, but we can give the results of quite 
a number of experiments to demonstrate the effect of certain tem- 
peratures on peas which were put through rapidly from the time 
the vines were cut until they were put into the retorts for steriliza- 
tion. I made a number of experiments with peas, canned in the 
manner often seen in canning houses, where the vines were allowed 
to become heated. In the latter case the sterilization seemed to be 
more effective than peas put through quickly, but muddy liquor re- 
sulted in a number of cans, showing that the cellulose had become 
much softened. I attribute the more complete sterilization to the 
fact that all spores were probably giving rise to vegetating rods 
which are easily destroyed by boiling temperature. Many cans 
were sterilized completely in twelve minutes at 240°. The cans 
were placed in an incubator, where the temperature was maintained 
at blood heat, 'which is favorable for the growth of most bacteria. 
Out of twelve cans processed at the temperature given above only 
two swelled and the balance kept all right. I opened them after 
several months, and although the liquor was clouded, the peas were 
not undergoing decomposition; the bacteria were all destroyed. 
If any spores had been present before the sterilizing process the 
temperature and time of exposure w^ould have been insufficient to 
destroy them. In order to demonstrate that all bacteria in these 
cans were dead after sterilization, I streaked a number of Petri 
dishes containing nutrient agar with the juice of the peas, then 
placed them in the incubator in a temperature of 98° F., where 
they remained until the agar dried up, without showing any signs 
of bacterial growth. 

After this experiment I tried a number of cans of very small 
peas taken from the vines as quickly as possible, and covered them 
with good clear brine and then processed them for 12 minutes at 
240° F., the same as I had given the cans in the previous experi- 
ment'. In two days all of these cans swelled in the incubator and 
I removed them. The pressure from the gas generated within the 
cans was great and when punctured the juice squirted out with 
considerable force. An examination of this juice by the hanging 
drop method revealed a number of rod forms showing motility. 
There were several kinds, some of them quite active, si)inning, 



364 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 



BacilluB Subtilisy Ehrenberg* 

HAY BACILLUS. 

Origin. — In water, soil, faeces, putrid fluids and in infusions of hay. 

Form. — Large, rather thick rods, having rounded ends and being three 
to four times as long as wide. Found usually in pairs; frequently in 
threads. 

Motility. — ^Actively motile; snake-like motion; having from eight to 
twelve flagella. 

Sporulaiion. — Large, oval spores are formed at or near the middle, 
without enlargement ; these are highly resistant, and may be double stained 
readily. Germination. 

Anilin Dyes. — Stain readily, as does Gram's method also. 

Growth. — This is very rapid; cell division has been observed to take 
place in seventy-five minutes at 21° and in twenty minutes at 35*. 

Gelatin Plates. — The surface colonies liquefy gelatin rapidly and ex- 
tensively. The central portion of the colony presents the appearance of 
a grayish-yellow, irregular mass; on close examination it is seen to be 
made up of moving cells. This is surrounded by a lighter, granular zone. 
The border is quite characteristic, consisting of a dense zone of bacilli 
and threads, radially arranged, the ends projecting outward, presenting a 
striking appearance — the so-called "ray crown." 

Stab Culture. — Funnel-shaped liquefaction takes place very rapidly 
along the entire line of inoculation. White, flocculent masses accumulate 
at the bottom, the liquid above, which is at first turbid, becoming clear. 
A dense white scum or zooglea is usually formed on the surface. 

Streak Culture. — On agar, a dull grayish-white, thick, folded scum is 
formed. It develops well on potato, forming a moist, thick, yellowish 
white covering, at first velvety in appearance, but later becoming dry and 
granular, which contains spores as well as involution forms. On blood- 
serum it forms a folded scum and liquefies. 

Oxygen Requirements. — Aerobic. 

Temperature. — It will grow at from 10" to 45** C. Best at about 30* C. 

Behavior to Gellatin. — Liquefies rapidly and extensively. 

Pathogenesis. — It has no effect. If spores are injected into the blood 
they soon disappear, being taken up by the liver and spleen. They may 
preserve their vitality after being stored up in these organs for sixty to 
seventv days. (Wyssokowitsch.) 

A large number of bacilli resemble to a marked extent the Bacillus 
subtilis. It is, therefore, customary to speak of the group of hay bacilli.

turning over and over in somersaults ; some were slower in motion, 
having a tendency to stand on end and to collect in bunches near the 
center of the drop of juice. These were the anaerobic species 
which do not thrive in the presence of oxygen. 

The activity motile rods belonged to the aerobic species and are 
able to live also in an anaerobic condition. I isolated the various 
forms, some of which would not grow at all on the surface of the 
Petri dishes. The anaerobic species developed well in test tubes 
containing agar by making the inoculation with a platinum needle 
plunged clear to the bottom. These tubes were placed in the an- 
aerobic culture apparatus, where all oxygen is replaced by hydrogen 
or absorbed by neutralized pyrogallic acid. (See Chapter III.) 
I made some experiments with the self- registering thermometer 
to ascertain how long a time was required for the temperature in-

dicated on the retort thermometer to register at the center of cans 
of peas. The self-registering thermometers are made in two ways. 
One is made lo fit a can specially constructed for the purpose; it is 
screwed downward from the lop and is sealed with a gasket, the 
mercury coUimn being exactly in the center of the can. The other 
kind rests on a tripod, which may be inserted into the regular can 
and held in position by the legs of the stand. The first kind is not 
suitable from the fact that the gasket frequently leaks, and there is 
more metal used in constructing the special can, thus preventing the 
heat from penetrating to the center as rapidly as it does through 
the regular can. The other kind has the advantage because it is 



PEAS. 367 

sealed up within the regular can and is always under the same con- 
ditions as the goods which are being packed. 

The mercury column in the self-registering thermometer is 
made with a constriction near the mercury bulb; so whenever the 
column rises to a certain mark it remains stationary until the can 
is opened. In this way the maximum temperature will be indi- 
cated. 

To make a series of tests to find out the length of time re- 
quired for certain temperatures to reach the center of a can, yon 
will proceed in the regular manner by gradually raising the temper-

degree of heat for twenty minutes you allow the pressure to de- 
crease, chill the can. open and examine the thermometer, and yon 
will find that it indicates only 225" F. At 240° F. for twenty 
minutes. 230° F. is registered at the center. At 250° for twenty 
minutes only 235° have been registered. 

.^fter a number of tests I have prepared a table which shows 
the time required for the heat to register at the center of the cans, 
using different lengths of time and different degrees of heat. 

I made a number of experiments to determine the length of 
time required for a given temperature to register at the center of a 



368 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

can of peas. I found that the time required was much less than 
that for corn, owing, no doubt, to the more fluid nature of the con- 
tents. The juice of the peas makes a very good carrier of heat 
from tlie tin to the center of the cans. There is no doubt that the 
center of hard peas is less penetrable, consequently such peas will 
not have the recorded degree of heat inside, even though the liquor 
does register a certain temperature. There would be only a small 
difference with small size peas, but the older varieties would prob- 
ablv need a few minutes extra time. To show the result of ex- 
periments with self-registering thermometers I will give the re- 
sults as recorded in my notebook. The left hand column will show 
the number of minutes given, while the different degrees, as indi- 
cated by the retort thermometer, are at the heads of the columns :

A careful study of this table brings out some important facts : 
230° F. for forty minutes is the same as 240° F. for twenty min- 
utes; 235^ F. for forty minutes is the same as 240°F. for thirty 
minutes and 250° for twenty minutes. It requires about forty 
minutes for a given retort temperature to be recorded at the center. 
Peas processed at 250° for thirty minutes reach 244° F., which 
makes an average of 237^ F. for at least fifteen minutes. 

I made a number of experiments, using various temperatures, 
for sterilizing peas. I boiled. twelve cans in open bath for two 
hours, then put them in the incubator to favor the development of 
bacteria, should any be left alive inside the cans. Five spoiled 
within one day, three spoiled by the end of the second day, and two 
more swelled the following day. Two cans seemed to be all right. 
They did not swell, although kept in the incubator at blood tem- 
perature for three weeks. On opening these cans, however, they 
were exceedingly sour. The color of the peas was much bleached, 
but otherwise they looked fairly well, except that the acid was 
strong and surprised me very much when I tasted them. 

I melted a flask of agar in the autoclay at 240 degrees F., then 
filled six Petri dishes. When cooled to about 120 degrees F. I 
inoculated two with several loops full of the liquor from these cans. 
then made transfers from the first two into two more, and from 
these made transfers into two more. I placed the dishes in the in- 



cubator and at the end of twenty-four hours, the two first dishes 
were completely covered with a thin growth extending even up to 
the walls. 

The next two dishes had a few colonies, but the greater por- 
tion of the surfaces were covered with a spreading growth. The 
two last dishes contained a few scattered colonies which formed in 
wedge shape or whetstone shape below the surface, and grew up- 
ward, forming thin, round colonies on the surface. Some of these 
colonies had a brown, opaque, granular appearance by transmitted 
light, but on reaching the surface had a bluish cast with a shining

transparent luster. The surface growth extended gradually to 
about the size of a silver three-cent piece, the lustrous appearance 
giving way to a dull scum-like layer quite viscous and forming 
folds or wrinkles, becoming much elevated. 

When transplanted to gelatin the colonies began to sink into 
the gelatin, in thirty-six hours leaving saucer-like depressions, and 
a floating film formed on the surface of the liquefied gelatin. The 
growth in bouillon was rapid, producing very little cloudines, a 
pellicle forming on the top which grew fast to the wall of the test 
tube.

objective into focus, present a wonderful appearance. The bacilli

demonstrate the flagella or organs of locomotion. 

The cultures all had the odor of sulphuretted hydrogen, and in 
a few days the sulphur would be strong enough to bleach out the 
blue color made with the marking pencil on the glass Petri dishes 
and test tubes. I inoculated several cans of peas which had been 
sterilized, with some of these organisms and in two or three days 
the cans had the same ajjpearance and taste as the original two cans, 
I tested other cans by inoculating them with spores from this or- 
ganism and processing at 240 degrees F. for twenty-five minutes. 
Of the twelve cans so treated onlv two were sterilized. Ten of

one of these spoiled, so I began an investigation of tlie causes of 
the spoilage. I made a series of inocniations in Petri dishes as 
previously described, and in twenty- four hours had a very fine 
growth of a germ answering every pnblished characteristic of ba- 
cillus niesentericus ruber, commonly found on potatoes. 

This is a somewhat slender bacillus discovered by Globig, who 
isolated it from boiled potato. It is a chromogenic baciUus form- 
ing a pinkish yellow pigment. It is an aerobic organism, but is able 
to grow fairly well where oxygen is almost excluded. I remem-

bered well that the can I liad opened was nut full by nearly one inch, 
so that enough oxygen was present to give sufficient of that element 
for the growth of the bacilli. The colonies on agar were a yellow 
color, and those which lay just under tlie surface came rapidly to 
the top and began spreading. Uinler a magnification of "fifty dia- 
meters, fine points were visible, extending outward from the veil- 
like growth. The growth on gelatin is similar, except that lique- 
faction begins as soon as the colonies begin to spread. On the sur- 
face of the liquefied gelatin a pink-like film farms. In the test tube

advance of the filmed and wrinkled layer, and from this thin growth 
we are enabled to get the most actively motile rods. The flagella 
of these rods are always very numerous, and enable them to travel 
forward, rapidly spreading over the whole surface. The spores 
of this species are probably more resistant than any of the very 
common varieties of bacilli, excepting those of bacillus subtilis, and 
some varieties common to the soil. They are larger in diameter 
than the cell itself and are oval. The spore wall is quite thick, 
which accounts for its great resistance to heat.

for six hours. This is a cbromogenic actively motile, aerobic organism first found 
on potatoes. It is widespread, being found on peas, corn, beans, etc. Magnified 
1,000 diameters. 

When these spores are inoculated into cans of peas they soon 
spoil and it is remarkable that only one of the six cans processed at 
240° F. contained any of this species. I believe that if the cans are 
well filled with liquor the small amount of oxygen present would 
likely interfere with the growth of this bacillus. Cans filled nearly 
full and exhausted contain little or no oxygen, and all bacteria 
would sbon be forced to grow in an anaerobic condition. 

A certain packer once sent me a few cans of peas which he 
had processed at 240° for twenty-five minutes. Almost half were 
sour, having living bacteria present in them. The liquor was quite 
cloudy and when viewed under the microscope, in a hanging drop, 
motile organisms were seen moving quite freely, sometimes singly, 
but generally two together. They were slender and were endowed

with numerous flagella. I isolated these by plate culture and 
found that two species were present, one belonged to the group of 
anaerobes and refused to grow on agar, except in an atmo^pliere of 
bydrngen or by the pyrogallate method. I was able to get a good 
growth of both by a stab culture in agar of one, and a surface 
growth of the other variety. These two organisms had been ac- 
customed to grow in the same goods, one being an aerobe, utilized 
all the oxygen obtainable and produced a condition of anaerobsis 
which was favorable for the growih of the anaerobic species. The 
other bacillus, although an aerobic, was also a facultative anaerobe, 
consequently flourished well in either condition. This phenomenon 
is often seen in bacteriological examinations, in so much that we 
have difficulty at times in separating certain species. 



I fled l.GOO dtamaters. 



Both of these species began to form spores in three days, and 
I inoculated several cans of peas with them and gave them 240° F. 
for twenty-five minutes, and then put iheni in the incubator at 98^ 
F. About one week later I opened these cans and they were all 
right. This seemed strange, becau-JC the packer who had experi- 
enced the difficulty had given them this very process, so for a time 
I was puzzled to know wh\- m\- ex])eriment had failed to show 
signs of spoilage. I streaked agar plate? with the juice of my 
cans, but did not obtain any growth of bacteria. The only expla- 
nation I am able to make is that his peas were larger and harder 



than tliose in tlie cans which I had inoculatetl. I had noticed this 
when I opened the original cans. 

There is, of course, another explanation ; his thermometers and 
ganges might have been incorrect, but the first explanation is prob- 
ably right, because a process of 240° for twenty-five minutes is too 
short for peas, excepting perhaps the very smallest sizes. Even 
the small sizes may not be perfectly sterilized at this temperature. 
From our table showing the penetrability of heat by the test of 
inside thermometers, we find that only 230° F. is registered at the 
center of the cans in twenty-five minutes at 240 degrees, and this 



is hardly sufticient to destroy the spores in all cases. 

We must not lose sight of another very important factor in 
dealing with spores. Old si>ores, those which have become ilried 
or have been in a resting state for a long time, will be more difficult 
to destroy than the spores which have formed in laboratory cul- 
tures, which may be only se\"eral days old. 

Laboratory cultures of bacteria, as a rule, are more readily de- 
stroyed by heat than the same bacteria which find a suitable sub- 
stratum in peas in the field. The spores which get into canned

peas may be old ; they may have been in a dormant state for a 
year or more, and consequently are dried, and the spore membrane 
may have shnmken and become more impenetrable. Our labora- 
tory cultures of the spore-bearing species, usually form spores with- 
in a few days, and these, when transplanted into sterile cans of peas 
for experimental sterilization, are more susceptible to heat than the 
kind we have described. Our table of temperatures employed for 
sterilizing peas is best prepared from the results obtained in actual 
canning. A variety of spoilage cases are recorded in our note- 
book, and we will put the results of the various processes in table 
form, and then draw some practical conclusion, keeping in mind 
always, the various sizes of peas, also the location of the canning 
establishment :

After Studying these different cases we see that the chances 
of spoilage at 240^ F. for any time less than forty minutes is great. 
and we are impressed with the conviction that 240° F. is not a 
very reliable temperature. Perhaps in Canada and the northern 
states 240° F. for forty minutes is sufficient for all large and medi- 
um sizes and the very small sizes might keep well at the same 
temperature for thirty-five minutes, unless the weather should be 
hot and rainy, in which case the temperature should be increased. 

In the central states we should recommend 2t;o° F. for thirty 



PBAS. 377 

minutes for large sizes, and twenty-live minutes for the small sizes. 

This cannot be laid down as a positive rule, however, but we 
may outline a definite method of ascertaining positively the best 
temperature under all conditions. 

If the peas are worked up promptly and not allowed to go 
through any sweating process, the skins being firm and strong, we 
would recommend that 250° for thirty minutes be tried first, and 
if they hold up all right and do not crack open and cloud the liquor, 
that process will give good satisfaction. The alum in the blanching 
bath will help to give firmness to peas, so that this temperature may 
be used with safety. If, however, the peas are too tender, the time 
should be cut down to twenty-five minutes and the result carefully 
noted. It is a good plan to have an incubator in some part of the 
factory, "and a good microscope is almost indispensable. After a 
certain process, a few cans out of each batch may be placed in the 
incubator, and kept in a temperature of 98° F. — ^blood temperature 
— and if the sterilization is imperfect, there will be a growth of bac- 
teria within twenty-four to thirty-six hours. Here is where a good 
microscope with a 1-12 homogeneous oil immersion objective, is 
most valuable. The cans in the incubator are removed one at a 
time, the juice poured out into a clean dish and drops of the juice 
exam*ined carefully. A simple method of examination is made by 
placing a drop in the center of an ordinary microscope slide, then 
dropping a clean coverglass over this, so as to have the juice be- 
tween the two pieces of glass. A tiny drop of cedar oil is then 
placed on the center of the coverglass, and the iris diaphragm is 
closed so that the hole for admission of light is about as large as a 
pin-head in diameter. The light is then focused with the concave 
mirror and the Abbe condenser: the 1-12 oil immersion objective 
is carefully lowered, by means of the coarse adjustment, until it 
touches the oil, and then it is brought into focus by the fine adjust- 
ment, being very careful not to let it crush through the glass, which 
might destroy the delicate lens. In this connection we might refer 
our readers back to the description of a hanging drop examination 
in Chapter III. 

If the microscope is equipped with a mechanical stage, the 
fields of view may be changed with precision, and the presence of 
any motile bacteria may be noted very readily. By reference to the 
numerous plates of various species of bacteria found in peas, it 
may be possible that some \vill be found which bear close resem- 
blance to our illustrations. If no bacteria can be seen bv the 
methods described, it is a simple matter to stain a few coverglasses 
evenly spread with the juice. The staining methods described in 
Chapter III will help any one to accomplish this feature of the bac- 
teriological technique with ease and certainty. It is not always 



378 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

easy for beginners to find living bacteria, because they are almost 
colorless, and the fluid is apt to form currents and confuse an^^ one 
not familiar with this kind of examinations. A little practice with 
stains first, and living bacteria afterwards, will soon help the be- 
ginner to get accurate results. After acquiring a little experience, 
the juice from a number of cans may be examined in a short time, 
and the presence or absence of living bacteria may be ascertained 
with accuracy. By following up the practical work with the scientific 
it becomes an easy matter to keep well informed on the safety of 
of every day's work. After a time the various results following each 
amount of sterilization, ordinarily given peas, will furnish to the 
trained eye — by the aid of the microscope and the appearance of 
the goods — all the necessary evidences of imperfect sterilization, 
whether too short or too much prolonged. 

We can thus sum up the points brought out under the head of 
peas : 

There must be no delays after the vines are cut. Good judg- 
ment must be exercised in directing the cutting to avoid overcrowd- 
ing the viners. If the vines are piled up in cribs or stacks, lactic 
fermentation get well started even in a short time. During rainy 
weather the work must be close up; the wet vines will sour verj' 
quickly. When lactic acid forms in peas it is never neutralized after- 
ward. 

"Sweating" softens the fiber or cellulose, and such peas Avill 
cloud the liquor. '^Sweating" to the extent of forming butA'ric, 
lactic and fatty acids, will cause "slimy" pea*^. 

The cleaning, separating and hand picking must follow the 
viners quickly, to avoid souring. 

The blanching should be done in running water if possible ; a 
fiual cold water alum bath might be well recommended, then a spray 
of cold, clear water. 

The filling should be uniform. Do not fill cans too full, about 
three-quarters of an inch from the top of cans is about correct. 

For making brine use either spring, well or filtered water. 

Never use saccharin as a sweetener, it is a violation of pure 
food laws in many states, and deceives the consumer. 

Note. — The peculiar sweet taste of saccharine will soon pre- 
judice the consumer against peas. I have made several experi- 
ment lately to ascertain this truth. Saccharin is not a food: it may 
have medicinal value in some cases, but when added to peas or other 
foods it is deemed an adulterant, and by various authorities is 
branded as injurious. 

Use granulated sugar if a sweetener is necessary. Have good 
machinery and sufficient to avoid overcrowding at anv time. 



PEAS. 379 

For sterilizing use 250° F., in preference to 240° F. ; it is 
more reliable and saves time. Thirty minutes for large sizes and 
twenty-five minutes for small sizes may be stated as a broad rule — 
this, of course, may be varied if conditions make it necessary. 

Always chill the cans before opening the retorts, by turning 
cold water into them. See diagram of process kettle, Chapter VI, 

Fig. 31. 

The calcium system offers some advantages in sterilization. The 

revolving crates will permit the heat to penetrate to the center of 

the cans more- rapidly than in the retort system. The time may 

therefore be shortened a little.

SPOILAGE OF PEAS. 

Some of the processes as given out from various sources are 
not altogether reliable, and such losses as have been reported up 
to this time are caused by insufficient sterilization. Insufficient 
sterilization is shown in two ways — the losses from swells and sour- 
ing without any formation of gas. In the case of swells large 
quantities of gas are formed; this is due to bacteria belonging 
largely to the putrefactory organisms, especially to the anaero- 
bic species universally distributed in the soil, the spores of which 
are found on the pods, leaves and vines of peas, carried there no 
doubt in particles of dust. The spores of anaerobic bacteria are 
not as resistant to the influence of high temperatures, as the spores 
of other varieties which do not form any gas. Some of the aero- 
bic bacteria do not form gas when growing in cans of peas, and 
nearly all of the common spore bearing aerobes are able also to 
grow anaerobically. This class of bacteria causes the greatest and 
most complete losses in peas, corn, beans, asparagus, etc., because 
the decomposition is not evidenced by any swelling of the cans, and 
usually is not discovered until after quite a lapse of time. Some- 
times the souring is quite slow, and does not show until two or three 
weeks after the peas are packed; sometimes the time is much 
longer. 

Any sterilizing process which is followed by swells is very far 
below what it should l)e because, as we have said, that form of 
spoilage is accomplished by a class of bacteria less resistant to heat 
than the class which produces acidity without the formation of gas. 
In Bulletin 249 of the New York Agricultural Experiment Station 
at Geneva, Messrs. Harding and Nicholson made a number of ex- 
periments to determine the cause of the malodorous decomposition 
of canned peas, and also the amount of heat necessary to destroy 
the bacteria. The bacteria responsible for swells as they found 
them are anaerobes, and not the most resistant forms. 



380 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

We have often isolated these from both peas and corn. They 
are ahnost as difficult to cultivate (on artificial media), as the 
Bacilkis tetanus, or lockjaw germ. In our laboratory work we 
find that such organisms thrive best on a medium prepared with the 
juice of the very goods in which we find them growing. Fre- 
quently we find that we get a very poor growth on agar prepared 
with meat juice and peptone. After obtaining sub cultures, how- 
ever', they do pretty well. The cultivation of anaerobic bacteria 
to obtain a superficial growth is quite diffinilt. and since this is the 
only kind of a culture that is fit for staining the young rods in order 
to demonstrate the flagella, or organs of locomotion, great care 
must be exercised in the technique. As we have stated, the anae- 



by PiazmowBkl), Tbls piBle shows 
Ualed nnaeroblcally by tbe pyro- 
1 and pbotagrapbed tbroagb 1-lS 

robic bacteria grow only where oxygen is entirely excluded, that 
gas in the free state being poisonous to then], it must either be 
replaced by hydrogen or absorbed by chemicals. We are very suc- 
cessful in growing these anaerobes by the pyrogallate method, 
which is done by sealing loosely stoppered tubes containing the in- 
oculated or streaked agar, in a jar, previously adding enough al- 
kaline fluid to neutralize a given quantity of pyrogallic acid. This 
mixture is poured into the jar and the culture tubes are placed in- 
side and the jar is then sealed absolutely tight with sealing wax. 
We obtain the best results by first growing a pure culture in 
the clear juice, in the anaerobic jar, and then from this we streak

slanted agar tubes, using a liberal quantity of the juice to cover the 
surface of. the slant. After two days we generally get a good su- 
perficial or surface growth. A small quantity of this growth mixed 
with water and thinly spread over the surface of a coverglass is 
generally all right for staining. The staining for the demonstra- 
tion of flagella, as shown in Plate 134, is a very difficult task, re- 
quiring experience and judgment to obtain good results. Many 
failures may be expected ere a first-class preparation fit for photo- 
micrographing is obtained. 

Spore bearing bacilli of this class form spores rapidly, especi- 
ally in the incubator, and w'hen this stage is reached the flagella 
cannot be easily demonstrated. Many of those delicate hair-like 
organs of locomotion drop off and are dissolved in the surrounding 
fluid, leaving the rod with its bright spore nearly devoid of flagella. 
In such preparations the spores are seen both in the rods and also 
free, as show-n in Plate 135. The spores are the resistant forms of 
bacterial life. They may be regarded as the seed forms. The 
spores are formed within the rods and the first indication of spore 
formation is the appearance of granules throughout the cell, which 
soon collect in a certain place, at first as an irregular mass, gradu- 
ally assuming a round or ellipsoidal form and becoming brighter 
and more refractive, having a wall or distinct membrane. This 
membrane becomes thicker and protects the life within, just as 
the membrane, which surrounds a dry mustard seed, be an or pea. 
It prevents heat from penetrating to the inside; even boiling tem- 
peratures are resisted for several hours. Spores form in the rods 
only when conditions become unfavorable for multiplication. Re- 
production or multiplication is the natural characteristic of bacteria, 
but this soon ceases in culture media, because the supply of nour- 
ishment is limited, and there is no provision for carrying off the 
products excreted by the bacteria. In cleavage processes the com- 
pounds which are formed are often poisonous to the germs and act 
as antiseptics. It is due to this fact that the antitoxins used in dis- 
eases are so valuable. The toxins are poisonous to the germs 
themselves, and render the medium upon which they are growing 
unfit for their multiplication, hence spores are formed which have 
the power to resist the poisons, until such time as they may find 
lodgment in a more suitable substratum. This power to resist an 
imfavorable environment is the secret of the difficulty experienced 
in sterilizing canned goods without injuring the quality. As a rule 
the line of safety in sterilization is so close to the line of danger 
from scorching that it is sometimes quite difficult to produce goods 
which will keep well and still retain much of the natural flavor. 
Sterilization will always change the flavor to some extent, but 
goods must not have a scorched taste or odor. It cannot be laid

down as a positive rule that peas will be processed properly at a 
temperature of 240° F. for 25 to 30 minutes. We have on reconl 
a number of spoilage cases where this temperature failed. While 
a number of packers will testify that this has always been sufficient 
for their peas, there are still others who have lost considerable 
money on account of sour peas. The only possible way to know 
just what temperature is sufficient is by bacteriological examina- 
tion. I have sterilized peas perfectly at 250° R for 15 minutes. 
but I know' that it would be ruinous to use such a process uni- 
versally. In the laboratory we have sterilized peas and com. too, 
in 20 minutes' exposure to 240^ F., but it happened that the raw 
product was free from some of the resistant varieties. It is pretty 
safe to start out M-ith a process ot 250^ F, for about 25 minutes;

some of the cans may then be placed in a warm place for two or 
three days, and the juice may Chen be examined under a one-twelfth 
homogeneous oil immersion lens. Since nearly all of the bacteria 
identified with spoilage are motile, the rods may be seen swimming 
around in the juice. We would recommend a temperature of 250° 
F, for 25 to 30 minutes. One or two cans sent to the laboraton,- by 
express will reach us within 24 hours in most cases, and we are well 
equipped to examine any goods and report by wire if necessary to 
increase the time. 



PEAS. 383 

The following letter is one which must be interesting to every 
packer because it is a description of the difficulties and losses which 
have befallen many, and seemed so mysterious, too: 

Prof. E. W. Duckwall, care of National Canners' Laboratory, As- 
pinwall, Pa. 

Dear Sir: — ^^'e are sending you by express today, charges 
prepaid, a box containing six cans of peas. These were absolutely 
fresh stock, shelled, cleaned, filled and processed without any delay, 
and cooked under ten-pound pressure twenty-five minutes after the 
glass showed 240^ ; then cooled and stacked in cases. The swelling 
shows about a week after being cooked, and seems to be very gen- 
eral, from present appearance, perhaps one-fourth of the pack. 
We have, on noticing this condition, increased our cook to fifteen- 
pound pressure, or 250"^, and find that we have the difficulty 
stopped, but we are at a loss to understand the conditions that ex- 
isted in the first two weeks' pack. W'c have cooked our peas for 
the past three years at the ten-pound pressure, and from twenty to 
thirty minutes, and have had no trouble of any moment. This was, 
too, when our factory was crowded, and the peas did not go 
through the process as promptly as they have this season. Also, 
w^hen they had to be delayed in threshing other seasons on account 
of excessive deliveries; in fact all the conditions in our factorv this 
year are 25 per cent better than they have been. 

Another point is, that we have insisted on our goods being de- 
livered at an early stage of growth, and the result being that we 
have packed very much larger of high-grade goods and this loss 
coming at this time is exceedingly trying, and we would appreciate 
very much your assistance. 

You may perhaps remember the writer meeting you at Co- 
lumbus last February and talking over this very point of processing 
peas, and you expressed your views at that time that we would 
probably have to increase our temperature. 

Thanking you for your interest in the matter, we beg to re- 
main. 

Very truly yours. 



The six cans arrived, three of them bursted and contents gone. 
The odor was very bad, showing that putrefactive bacteria had ac- 
complished the spoilage. The three remaining cans were badly 
swelled, and when punctured the force of the gas caused the juice 
to spurt out in a stream. We quickly streaked a number of petri 
dishes and agar slants, also inoculated some tubes of liquid culture 
media. Part of tlltse were placed in anaerobic jars, so that the 
anaerobic bacteria might form colonies along with the facultative 



3*4 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODfCTS. 

aerobes. After two days quite a number of colonies made their ap- 
pearance, some of each species. The anaerobic bacteria were rods 
which formed terminal spores as shown in Plates 134 and 135. 
The facultative anaerobic bacteria formed small colonies in the jar, 
but in the petri dishes the colonies developed better, where free 
oxygen was accessible. The colonies were found with a lustrous 
appearance, bluish white, with opaque centers. Under a magnifi- 
cation of 60 they appeared granular with rough margins. The 
agar streak was a dirty white growth in folds. Streaked from a 
fresh bouillon culture the growth was moist and spreading, and 
from this we were able to get a preparation for staining flagella, or 
organs of locomotion, as shown in Plate 136.

The spore formation took place in the center of the rod, as 
shown in Plate 137. This organism produced spores rapidly. It 
was not possible to get motile growths by transplanting from one 
surface growth to another in agar, spores formed almost as rapidly 
as the new growth appeared. The only way we were able to get 
the true growth, one that would show flagella in staining, was from 
a fresh bouillon culture streaked on i^ per cent agar, and then 
from a six or eight hours' growth. The anaerobes would not grow 
well in the bouillon at first, but afterwards \te were able to get 
fairly good results. The bacilli have round ends 3 to 10 ;t long 



and I to 1.5 ft thick. (A /x is equal to one-twenty-five thousandth 
of an inch.) The rods grow in chains and form spores at the ends 
or near the center, in the latter case giving the ceil a very plump 
appearance like a spindle. This is called a Clostridium form. The 
cells are quite motile when young, and endowed with numerous 
flagella, as shown in Plate 134. The spores form rapidly and are 
thicker than the rod itself. They mea.sure from r.8 to 2.6 p. in 
thickness. When vegetating, the spore is ruptured at the end, and 
the young rod pushes out. One spore produces only a single rod. 
The rods lengthen and divide and this is the manner of multiplica- 
tion, true of all bacteria excepting the micrococci or round forms. 
This organism forms butyric acid, carbon dioxid and the hydrogen 
combines with sulphur and hydrogen sulphid is formed. This 
is the organism which softens the fiber and causes decomposition

of cellulose, in which case march gas or methane is sometimes 
formed. When starch is added to a culture medium and a growth 
of these bacilli is obtained, they may be stained with iodine and a 
beautiful blue stain is obtained. The cells of the bacteria will 
take in the starch and of course the blue reaction of iodine follows 
the staining. This is a beautiful experiment in staining and helps 
us to identify the germ as one an.swering the description of Bacillus 
Butyricus fPrazmowski) or P.aciilus Amylobacter, a very common 
organism found in putrefving vegetable infusions in cheese, milk, 
etc. 



386 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

The very fact that the anaerobic bacteria were present indicates 
that the process used (240° F. for 25 minutes) was much too low, 
because a temperature sufficient to destroy the spores of this species 
was not sufficient to destroy the spores of the other variety, as we 
found by actual test. We recommended that 250° F. be used for 
25 or 30 minutes. The packer states in his letter that the process 
given these peas was the same as that successfully used for three 
years previously, and that the peas went through very promptly 
without any delays as formerly in the threshing; that conditions 
were 25 per cent better than they were in past seasons, and that 
the peas were younger and better than usual in quality for high 
grade goods. This would seem very mysterious to any one not 
acquainted with the biological characteristics of bacteria, but the 
reason we shall endeavor to explain. 

When peas are allowed to stand, especially in piles, they be- 
come heated, and then follows what is called a "sweating process.'* 
This sweating is caused by bacteria starting with the lactic acid 
bacteria, which attack the carbohydrates, converting them into lac- 
tic acid, the fibre softens and the heat generated causes the spores 
of various species of bacteria to swell and vegetate. The aerobes 
and facultative anaerobes begin to vegetate first on the surface, thus 
utilizing all the available atmospheric oxygen, then the spores of 
the anaerobes soften and begin to vegetate, so that by the time 
the peas reach the sterilizing process all spores are softened, and 
many have no doubt vegetated. In the sterilizing process they 
are destroyed by a temperature considerably less than would have 
been required if the peas had been worked up quickly before the 
spores had started to vegetate. On first thought it would seem 
better to let peas stand a short time to allow the spores to soften in 
order to be sure of the sterilization. This, in fact, is the condition 
in a great many canneries, as the letter indicates there were numer- 
ous delays in the threshing during previous seasons, and those 
very same delays are the rule rather than the exception. It cer- 
tainly follows that a process used successfully with peas handled 
in the manner just described will suddenly fail if tised on strictly 
fresh peas. It must not be understood from this that serious de- 
lavs are common in nearlv all factories ; we do not mean this, but 
there are only a very few who work up the peas without some de- 
lays. Where the delays are serious, there is formed sufficient lactic 
acid to cause sour peas. 

Xo amount of sterilization will destroy the lactic acid when 
once formed, and the goods will be distinctly sour after the cans 
are opened, and in this case the liquor is frequently much clouded. 
The formation of lactic acid begins very soon if the vines or shelled 
peas are allowed to stand for any length of time, and this acid de- 



stroys the fine flavor of the peas according to the amount present. 
The modern method of cutting the vines and threshing out the 
peas has some disadvantages over the old method of hand picking, 
because the juice is necessarily more exposed. But this is more 
than compensated by the many ad\-antages in other ways, so that 
a better and more uniform quality may be secured if the arrange- 
ments are complete for taking care of the peas as rapidly as they 
are hauled in. 

We may draw this conclusion from our study of the bacteria 
associated with peas. Absolutely fresh stock has more resistant 
spores than raw material which has been exposed for a limited time, 
and will therefore require a little higher temperature to insure 
perfect sterilization. 



UD-ED6EVIEW 

Fig. 34. Process Kettle 

The quality of freshly canned peas will be very much superior 
even if the process is higher ,because no lactic acid is present; 250' 
F, for 25 to 30 minutes will be found quite siiflicient. but if there 
is any evidence of scorching, this must be cut down, because it is 
not necessary to scorch any goods to insure sterilization. A per- 
fect arrangement for chilling the cans is essential and the employ- 
ment of alum after the blanching is to be recommended for its as- 
tringent action on the skins of the peas, which prevents their burst- 
ing during sterilization. Cloudy or muddy liquor will thus be 



388 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

avoided, but all traces of the alum should be washed off with cold 
water before the peas are filled into the cans. 



SPOI1.AGE OF CANNED PEAS. 

It is a matter of wonder to us that some of the processes re- 
ported were sufficient in any degree. In reply to numerous letters 
of inquiry in the past, we have called attention to the fact that 
perfect sterilization of peas could not be accomplished under 250° 
F. for 25 or 30 minutes, and yet we have reports from various 
sources where the packers have used only 240° F. for as short a 
time as 16 to 18 minutes. Let us say that this temperature is en- 
tirely too low. While it might possibly be sufficient for some cans 
we predict that only a very few would remain in a perfect state of 
preservation for one year. Several canners have sent us cans taken 
from various piles and these we have placed in the incubator at 
98° F., and in nearly all cases the cans have either swelled or 
turned sour after a few days. There are generally tw^o different 
classes of organisms responsible for this spoilage. One class be- 
longs to the anaerobic species ; that is, the bacteria are able to grow 
only where atmospheric oxygen is entirely excluded or replaced by 
some other gas. These germs produce large quantities of gas 
which is malodorous, being a combination of sulphuretted hydro- 
gen, phosphoretted hydrogen and methane. The pressure of this 
gas in the cans is so great at times that the seams burst, the ends 
blow out and the steel sheet is rent. Some of the cans sent to us 
arrived entirely empty, the contents having escaped in transit. 

The other class of germs is aerobic, or facultative anaerobic 
By this we mean the bacteria are able to grow in an environment 
devoid of oxygen but their nature is to grow in the presence of oxy- 
gen. These germs produce chemical changes in the peas which are 
far more dangerous than those produced by the other kind, from 
the fact that they do not form any gases excepting small quantities 
of sulphuretted hydrogen, which is absorbed by the fluid of the 
contents. Where peas are spoiled by these bacteria, they give no 
evidence of the fact until the cans are opened. The liquor is gener- 
ally muddy and the peas are intensely acid. The natural sugar or 
carbohydrates is converted into simple and complex fatty acids. 
There is a large number of different species included in these two 
classes of bacteria just described. The general characteristics of 
all are similar. There are some biological or morphological dis- 
tinctions by which we are able to identify them and note the peculiar 
changes brought about in the certain cans. 

The following letter was received from a prominent canner of 
peas : 



PEAS. 389 

National Canners' Laboratory, Aspinwall, Pa. : 

Gkntlemen : — We are sending you today by prepaid express 
six cans of new pack of peas, four cans from early pack and two 
cans from late pack. We have had complaint concerning cloudy 
liquor on these goods and we would like you to inform us the cause 
of this, etc. 

Hoping to hear from you as early as possible and thanking 
you, we remain, Yours very truly. 



When these peas arrived we opened them carefully and ex- 
amined the juice under the microscope. The early varieties seemed 
to be the only ones affected. The liquor on the large varieties was 
perfectly clear. In the other case the peas were very much broken 
and the protein matter was cooked up with the juice so that in some 
cans it presented the appearance of pea soup. It was evident to my 
mind that these peas had been over-processed, but I cannot say 
what process was used because none is mentioned in the letters re- 
ceived. There are several conditions from which may result muddy 
liquor and bursted peas, and it is sometimes difficult to know just 
what the cause is. without being perfectly familiar with every step 
in the process of manufacture. For instance : If the shelled peas 
had been allowed to stand for any great length of time in baskets 
before blanching, it is quite likely that the skins would suffer from 
the action of bacteria. We know that certain bacteria have the 
power to soften fiber, and the spores of this very species are al- 
ways present on the skins of peas, having found their way there 
in the machines which do the hulling. Now, in case shelled peas 
were allowed to stand, even over night, when the temperature was 
quite warm, this decomposition of the fiber would likely take place. 
It is quite easy to understand, therefore, that the skins would not 
be able to withstand the pressure ordinarily given peas in steriliza- 
tion; they would burst and cloud the liquor. The same difficulty 
might arise from peas that had been filled into the cans, if the cans 
were allowed to stand for a long time, on account of breakdowns 
in the machinery, or overcrowding, but generally this bursting of 
the peas is due to over-processing. This case was so extremely 
bad that there is little doubt of this solution being correct. 

As we stated in a previous chapter, the processing should 
be just sufficient to keep the goods without danger of bursting the 
peas or imparting to them a scorched taste or odor. If a proper 
chilling apparatus be employed and alum used in the blanching pro- 
cess to toughen the skins of the peas, which it does by its astringent 
properties, there will be very little danger of peas bursting or hav- 
ing a scorched taste, unless the sterilization is pushed entirely too

far. We have found for all practical purposes, that 250® for 20, 
25 and 30 minutes, according to the sizes, will generally give pretty 
good results. We are aware that this process may be reduced 
somewhat in certain sections, but not very much, without great 
danger of spoilage.

Dear Sir : — We sent you some days ago samples of peas that 
we cooked 16 minutes at 240°. These vou reported as being all 
OK. 

We are sending you today six tins of peas, three that are 
bulged and three cooked same as the other cans sent vou. Kindlv 
advise if the three tins bulged are swells or leaks, also if the three 
cans that appear all right are all OK. In our opinion the three 
cans look like swells, as we have been unable to detect anv leak in 
the cans. However, there may be in the figure stamped on the cap 
or possibly in the impression. 

Verv trulv vours. 



E. W. Duckwall, Aspinwall, Pa. 

Dkar Sir : — Your favor of the gth at hand, same being in re- 
gard to the six cans of peas sent you Aug. 2d. We became con- 
vinced shortly after we sent these peas that we had swells. \\'e 
have canned peas at this place for seven years. We have several 
years cooked our Alaska peas as low as 15 and 16 minutes at 240. 
Our sweet wrinkle peas we have cooked anywhere from 18 to 22 
minutes at 240, and we never have had any swells before. Our 
Alaska pack this year were all cooked 18 minutes at 240. The Ad- 
miral peas this year we cooked nearly all at 240 for 18 minutes. 
We cooked a small amount 16 minutes at 240. The first cans we 
sent you were from the first of our 16 minute cook, and these you 
reported free from bacteria. Our Alaska's this year have no 
swells in them. We have now nearly completed piling our Admiral 
peas and have taken out about 10.000 swells. The small sizes seem 
to have more swells than any of the others, the third sieve or what 
we call sifted peas having the most. We are at a loss to know how 
soon it would be safe to begin shipping from these goods, and 
whether swells will continue to show up in the goods from now on. 
We have never been able to cook peas more than about 20 minutes 
at 240 and get a clear liquor. Answering your question as to a 
preservative, would say that we have never used any in our peas. 

Yours trulv. 



We were very much surprised on reading these letters that 
the parties had processed their goods successfully, as they claim, 
for a number of years at 240° F. for only 16 to 18 and 22 min- 
utes, and it is not surprising that the loss is so great, as the letter 
states that up to this time they have taken out about 10,000 swells.

I immediately exaniined the two cans left in the incubator and 
found one of them swelled. In my pre\'ious letter to these parties 
I asked them if they had used any preservatives. I did not make 
an analysis to determine if preservatives had been employed, and

this was unnecessary, because their last letter states that none had 
been used. I wrote these parties at once that I feared their spoil- 
age would be very great, because I did not see how it would be 
possible to keep these goods from spoiling in hot weather. 



392 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

The bacteria whicli are usually responsible for the spoilage 
of peas grow best in a temperature between 80° and 98^ F. It 
is possible to reprocess the cans at 240° F. for fifteen minutes.. All 
cans which have started to spoil will swell slightly in the process 
and the ends will draw in slowly, and they may be separated from 
the good. All cans which are infected with only a few bacteria 
can be saved by reprocessing, I set about to determine what or- 
ganisms were responsible for this spoilage. I inoculated several 
tubes of nutrient bouillon : also several test tubes of agar slants. I 
also streaked the surface of several Petri dishes containing nutri- 
ent agar. Some of the tubes of bouillon I sealed in the anaerobic 
apparatus and produced that condition by means of Pyrogallic acid 



and a weak solution of sodi 1 vd x 1 \\ i e he ac d nd he 
alkali come tofjether, ail the oxygen in the apparatus is absorbed, 
which leaves the tubes containing bouillon and agar in an anaerobic 
condition. The bouillon became cloudy within a few days. Cloudi- 
ness in the bouillon always indicates the presence of bacteria. Col- 
onies also made their appearance on the agar slants. These we ex- 
amined carefully and found that there were two kinds. One kind 
was an obligati\-e anaerobe. The other kind was a facultati\"e an- 
aerobe. The first kind is able to grow only where oxygen is en- 
tirely excluded; the second kind is able to grow in the presence or 
absence of oxygen. 



DESCRIPTION OF THE COLONIES OF THE ANAEROBES. 

The colonies were round and scalloped; of a brownish color; 
the surface was granular and there was a light-colored zone form- 
ing a ring near the outer edge. This was seen when magnified 60 
diameters. The natural color of the colony was white, and by 
transmitted light was gray with a blue center, white periphery. 
The surface looked moist and showed a distinct bluish colored circle 
in the center. Colonies are slightly elevated, measuring from 3 
to 6 millimeters in diameter. After transplanting to other slants. 
we were able to get a superficial growth of these bacteria, and to 
stain them for flagella, as the accompanying plate will illustrate. 
The flagella are organs of locomotion, and like all motile anae-

robes, the bacteria are very much curled. In various views of the 
slides which we stained there were large twisted bodies, which, are 
called giant whips. Many cultures of bacteria have the faculty of 
forming giant whips. Just what these bodies are has not been 
fully established, but it is thought that they are formed by numer- 
ous flagella which have fallen away from the germs and become 
twisted together. This organism produces a wonderful amount of 
gas, having a distinct odor of sulphuretted hydrogen. The water 
of condensation, which always forms at the bottom of an agar 
slant, fermented very freely and the escape of gas was evident by 
the large number of gas bubbles. We grew this organism in milk

Bacillus Mycoidea 

Origin. — Widely distributed in earth; found also in river and ia 
spring water. 

Form. — Rather large rods, with slightly rounded ends; these are 
thicker than the hay bacilhis Threads are common. 

Motility. — It has a slow motion. 

Sporulation. — Forms small median spores. 

Anilin Dyes, — Stain readily. 

Growth. — Rapid. 

Gelatin Plates. — The colonies soniew^hat resemble fine branching root- 
lets. At first they are round and dark, with bristly borders, but they sub- 
sequently branch out through the gelatin, which is slowly liquefied. 

Stab Culture. This is characteristic, the growth developing along the 
line of inoculation and from this threads penetrate or radiate into the sur- 
rounding gelatin. The growth being more rapid at the top than in the 
lower parts of the tube, the result is that it has the appearance of an in- 
verted pine tree. Subsequently the gelatin is completely liquefied, the 
bacterial growth accunuilating on the bottom and the liquid above be- 
coming clear, with a thin scum on the surface. 

Streak Culture. — On agar, a grayish growth is formed which spreads 
outward from the streak, often giving it an appearance resembling the 
centipede. On potato, it forms a slimy, whitish growth which contains 
large numbers of spores. 

Oxygen Require men ts. — Aerobic. 

Temperature. — It will grow at ordinary temperature, and in the incu- 
bator. 

Behavior to Gelatin. — Liquefies slowly. 

Pathogenesis. It has no effect, not even in large doses. Experiments 
are now being made on patients suffering with tubercle bacilli in the lymph 
system. Pure cultures of Bacillus Mycoides injected into the lymph glands 
seem to antagonize the multiplication of tubercle bacilli.

made blue by tincture of litmus, and within 24 hours the litmus 
had turned red and the milk became curdled. After 24 hours more 
the curd was dissolved and a heavy precipitate formed at the bot- 
tom of the tube. These organisms formed large terminal spores 
and grow more freely than the Butyric Acid bacilli, so named by 
Prazmowski. The spores of these bacteria were quite resistant to 
heat. They are able to withstand a temperature of 240° F. for 
about 10 minutes in test tubes, and in No. 2 cans of peas are not 
destroyed under 25 to 30 minutes at 240^ F. We were able to pro- 
duce some swelling of the cans in peas that we had in the labora- 
tory by inoculating cans with the spores. The germs do not grow 
well at ordinary temperature of 50^ to 70° F., and do not grow at 
all between 35 ° and 45° F. 

DESCRIPTION OF THE AEROBIC VARIETY. 

The aerobic variety seems to correspond pretty closely with 
bacilhis mycoides. The colonies were round, and of a bluish trans- 
parent cast. Under the microscope the edges are slightly scalloped; 
a smooth center, slightly yellow, becoming thin and transparent at 
the periphery. The natural size of the colony is about i to 4 milli- 
meters; extremely slimy, so that a needle dipped into the colony 
will carry a slimy thread for several inches on removal, ^\'e had 
a great difficulty in demonstrating the flagella. In this respect the 
germ resembles Bacillus ]\Iycoides. The streak on agar developed 
quite rapidly and grew down into the medium. Along the center 
scaly folds would form and from the edges would be distinct 
branches typical in every way of the Root Bacillus. Its identity 
therefore is established somewhere between Bacillus Vulgatus and 
Bacillus Mycoides. We stained the flagella with difficulty. We 
took the growth as young as possible, but were unable to get any 
preparation entirely free from slime. Some writers have declared 
that Bacillus Mycoides has no flagella or organs of locomotion, and 
after several futile attempts to demonstrate their presence by the 
regular method, it seemed probable that the flagella were absent. 
In hanging drop cultures, however, we could see that the bacilli 
were motile, having distinct serpentine and oscillating motion. On 
every cover glass the slime would form a very thin layer, suffi- 
ciently heavy, however, to obliterate the flagella, so we adopted an- 
other method of staining. We inoculated one cubic centimeter of 
water with a young culture; then added one cubic centimeter of 
chloroform, agitating the two together for some time. The chloro- 
form dissolved the slime and carried it down to the bottom. From 
the water above the chloroform we were able to get some very fair 
preparations for flagella staining. The accompanying plate shows 
the result of this work. This organism has a very small spore

Canning. Cold Packed Tomatoes. Suggestions. Laboratory 
Work. Various Bacteria Found in Leaky Cans of Tomatoes.

Tomatoes raised in one locality differ very much in character 
from those raised in another locality. The tomatoes raised in our 
northern states are more meaty and contain more sugar than those 
raised in the Valley of the Mississippi and the extreme eastern coast 
of the United States. The sweeter tomatoes are the best for can- 
ning purposes, while for making tomato catsup, chili-sauce and 
other condiments of this character, those which contain more acid 
are more desirable. 

It is difficult to say at what date the canning of tomatoes in 
this country can be set down accurately. There is a record of Wil- 
liam Underwood having canned tomatoes in glass as far back as the 
year 1820, but the business did not grow to any considerable extent 
until about 1875-80. There were a few scattered factories canning 
tomatoes between the years i860 and 1875, most of them in the 
neighborhood of Baltimore. The peeling of tomatoes was done by 
hand and there have been no machines perfected for this work up to 
this day. The filling of tomatoes into cans, capping, tipping, etc., 
were done by hand. Today most of the filling is done by machinery 
and the capping, of course, is put through rapidly by the automatic 
capping machines. 

Probably the best means of canning tomatoes is by what is 
known as a "cold process," that is to say, the tomatoes are filled into 
the cans after they are peeled and are not heated prior to the final 
sterilizing process. The old style of canning tomatoes w^as to fill 
the cans, then give them a heating in boiling water with the vents of 
the caps open; afterward they were removed and the vent holes 
soldered up, and then the cans were subjected to a sterilizing process 
of about thirty minutes at 212° F. 



TOMATOES. 399 

Tomatoes are not difficult to keep; all that is required is 
rapidity. This is absolutely necessary if one desires to can cold- 
packed tomatoes. They must be worked up very rapidly so that no 
bacteria will start fermentation. Fermentation of tomatoes may 
be due to several kinds of micro-organisms, but principally to wild 
yeast molds, acetic acid, and lactic acid bacteria. In this process of 
decomposition there is a gas liberated, carbon dioxid. If this gas 
is liberated in any quantity, it will prevent the cans from collapsing 
after the sterilizing process. In this case, it would be impossible to 
turn out fine goods unless the cans were vented. I would like to im- 
press this point, namely, that if cold-packed tomatoes are to be 
produced, there must be absolutely no fermentation of the tomatoes 
in any procer.s prior to sterilization. Fermentation sets in very 
rapidly after the tomatoes are peeled, particularly in weather where 
the thermometer registers between 80° and 90° F. They will fer- 
ment sometimes in the buckets of the peelers, especially where the 
peeler is rather slow in turning out her work. It is better to have 
small-sized buckets for the peelers and then keep the tomatoes 
worked up very closely. 

Much depends on the scalding apparatus. If the tomatoes are 
not properly scalded, fermentation is much more likely to follow 
than if the outside of the tomato simply is scalded. If the water 
is not kept at least 212° F. the tomatoes will be cooked through to 
the center. To simply scald the outside of the tomato, leaving the 
inside cool, is the ideal method of loosening the peels. In the steril- 
izing process, cold-packed tomatoes can be kept all right with a 
process of 35-40 minutes at 212° F. As a rule, the packer can 
judge whether his tomatoes are perfectly sterilized by examining 
the seeds. There is a gelatinous envelope around the seed in raw 
tomatoes and the cooking must be sufficiently prolonged to loosen 
this envelope. We have seen the seeds from canned tomatoes 
planted and some of them sprouted. All such canned tomatoes will 
swell; sometimes when no bacteria are present, there will be suffi- 
cient evolution of carbonic acid gas from the seeds themselves to 
cause the spoiling of the goods. Tomatoes are acid by nature and 
cans made for them must be well soldered. The smallest possible 
leak in the can will be much enlarged. In some cases where there 
is no leak at first the solder may be strained in the sterilizing pro- 
cess or by rough handling, and the acid juice of the tomato will 
work through. A great many of the spoilage cases of tomatoes 
submitted to the laboratory were due to leaks. In the following 
pages we will give some cases in detail. 

The year 1903 was the largest in the history of the canning 
business for tomatoes, the packing amounting to ten and one-half 
million cases.

A canner wrote as follows: "We have a condition this war

there any danger of the per cent getting larger when warm

termine. There are only about lo or 20 per cent of them sour.

Tiie can that is wrapped in tissue is one that we opened and found 
to be sour, and then sealed it again. We have had canned tomatoes 
here for years and have never seen anything like it before. We 
do not know the cause. As we put up a pack of 8,000 cases and as 
we kept no record of each day's pack, it would be hard to tell just 
what were the exact conditions under which the case which you got 
were packed, but I think I can tell you near enough what the condi- 
tions were all through, so you can determine what is the matter. The 
sample you got was taken from the early packing, where most of 
the trouble seems to be. The tomatoes as they came in were quite 
ripe, and sometimes they would stand on the platform in crates for 



TOMATOES. 401 

two or three days, but they seemed to be in good condition, i. e., 
there were not any rotten. They were scalded, peeled and put into 
cans reasonably quick. At times I presume there were tomatoes 
that stood for 30 minutes after they were peeled before they wert 
put into the can. I hardly think that they ever stood longer than 
30 minutes, as we were afraid to let them stand around after they 
were peeled. There were very few that stood longer than fifteen 
minutes before they were put into the can. At times leaks would 
be allowed to stand for an hour or two before repairing. I notice, 
how ever, that there are sours among those that were never patched. 
We processed 30 minutes in water at the boiling point, but it may 
be possible that the water got below boiling point sometimes, al- 
though we were careful about keeping the water hot. 



When the samples of souf tomatoes arrived we found that quite 
a number of cans were simply cap and tip leaks, but there were other 
cans which were very sour, yet showed no signs of leaks. We 
made bacteriological tests of all the cans which appeared to be 
sound, and in no case did we find anv livinsf bacteria in these cans. 
From the leaky cans, however, we isolated two kinds of bacteria 
which, when transplanted into good cans produced the same acids 
and aromatic flavors peculiar to the sour cans of tomatoes, showing 
that the conditions around the factorv were such as to endanq^er 
the goods at all times. 

The liquid in some of the leaky cans had turned to vinegar, 
and this had been attached by another organism, which we shall 
presently describe. The acetic acid bacteria are little rods having 
a slight constriction in the middle, giving them a dumb-bell shape 
when highly magnified. These bacteria are subject to complete 
change of form and this peculiarity is technically cajjed involution 
form. Plate 144 will show examples of all forms from the small 
typical rods, to swelled lemon shaped, club shaped and other forms 
so frequently seen in the mycoderma aceti or "mother of vinegar." 
When these germs are alone in their Avork, only acetic acid is 
formed, but when other organisms are present the acetic acid is 
changed and flavored with unpleasant aromatic substances, such as 
volatile fatty acids and ethers. 

m 

We isolated a chromogenic bacillus, which produced a reddish 
violet pigment in the agar. When transplanted into tomato juice 
it produced a deep red color and formed a pellicle on the surface. 
It is a slowly motile organism with very fine flagella, running out 
in gentle curls from the whole surface of rod. Our plate is magni- 
fied about 2,000 diameters and this is about four million times mag- 
nified. 



*02 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

From the pellicle we obtained the spores of the bacillus and 
were not able to destroy them by boiling. They do not grow 
readily on pure tomatoes and seem to demand acetic acid to get a

Start. SO this accounts for their not being generally found on toma- 
toes unless other organisms have worked out chemical changes, or 
produced substances favorable for their propagation. If we had 
to contend with this bacillus generally, our tomatoes would require

250 degrees F. for perhaps 25 minutes to destroy the spores. This 
would, of course, cook the tomatoes too much and it would be a 
problem to successfully pack them. If, however, we observe the 
rule, to work up the raw material as fast as it is received, we need 
have no fear of this difficulty. 

CONCI.USIONS. 

After investigating carefully the samples of sour tomatoes 
sent me I submit my report. There are quite a number of leaks 
among the cans in the capping and tipping. There are no living 
bacteria in any of the good cans or the cans which are sour, except- 
ing the leaks, therefore there will be no further souring of the goods. 
The sour tomatoes were sour before they were processed, probably 
before they were scalded, the acid having formed in them and still 
remains in the finished goods. I would advise you to work your 
tomatoes up quickly, or if unable to do this at all times, provide a 
way to make them into tomato pulp for catsup, etc. If you have 
mucli trouble with breakdowns, try and make such improvements 
in your mechanical apparatus as will preclude the possibility of sour- 
ing. Have your scalding water boiling hot — that is, hot enough 
to scald the skins off the tomatoes and still leave the inside of the 
fruit cool. In this way you will avoid souring after the peeling, 
to a great extent. I met with a case similar to this one in 1891 
which lead me to take up the study of bacteriology in connection 
with canning. 

If you have any doubts of your sterilizing apparatus, look into 
the matter carefully and arrange your system in such a way that 
no mistakes will be made at that point next season. This case has 
nothing to do with sterilization; the souring occurred before the 
tomatoes reached the process. I want to call your attention again 
to poor soldering, and would advise you to take steps to improve 
in that work. A great deal of your spoilage is no doubt due to 
imperfect work. 

TOMATOES PACKED IN A VACUUM JAR. 

The sample of spoiled Tomatoes was fermenting and the es- 
caping gas had made an opening through the wax. A microscopi- 
cal examination of the juice showed large numbers of yeast-like 
forms which we mounted on a slide. Plate 147 illustrates their ap- 
pearance. The dark cells are the oldest, and from these others 
have grown out from all sides, first making their appearance as 
very small excrescences, then gradually filling out, soon attain the 
same size and appearance as the mother cell, and in like manner 
these give rise to buds as before, until quite a little bunch will be 
seen en masse.

consequently a negative giving good contrast cannot be obtained. 
In the two plates we have part of the mycelium very much inter- 
laced, as it is naturally, and scattered throughout are the round 
fruit pods containing the seed or conidia.

The conidia have peculiar morphological characteristics, being 
able to assume two distinct biological characters marked by the man- 
ner of their reproduction and the chemical changes wrought, es- 
pecially when compelled to live in a partial or complete anaerobic 
environment. In this condition their appearance and vegetation re- 
semble the Blastomycetes or yeasts so closely that differentiation is 
difhcult, unless wc resort to the plate culture method, as was done 
in this case. Plate 147 illustrates the growth of Mucor Mucedo 
when submerged in nutrient tomato juice, where its supply of at- 
mospheric oxygen is cut off. while Plates 148 and 149 show the 
natural growth when the conidia are able to obtain oxygen from the 
atmosphere.

setting free carbonic acid gas in considerable volume, by which re- 
action, alcohol, succinic acid, glycerin, volatile fatty acids and others 
are formed, which in their turn are attacked by various kinds of bac- 
teria, most commonly by the acetic acid group, but frequently by 
motile putrefactive organisms, which produce disagreeable aromatic 
compounds. 

In Plates 148 and 149, we notice the dark round spots among 
the mold filament. There are colonies of bacteria, and there are 
two kinds, one of which is the acetic acid bacillus, described prev- 
iously. Plate 153 is a bacillus much resembling Megather-

organs of locomotion, but far more difficult to stain. The spore 
formation is peculiar, as shown in Plate 154. The spore occupies 
nearly the whole length of the cell, but gradually becomes smaller 
as the cell membrane is dissolved in the surrounding fluid. After 
this organism has done its work, the tomato juice has such a disa- 
greeable odor that nothing can be done with it. Ordinarily, to- 
matoes which have simply undergone fermentation may be made 
mto very good catsup, but not the best quality. 

BLACK ROT OF TOMATOES. 

We received by express a tomato, one side of which was com- 
pletely diseased by what is known as black rot disease, and the 
following letter will explain:

"J send you under separate cover' sample green tomato. A 
great many of the tomatoes on our vines present the same appear- 
ance, as this sample. Is this not caused by the tomato louse? Your 
opinion will he appreciated." 

The cause of the black rot is not due to the tomato louse, as 
the letter suggests, but to a bacterium. We made cultures of this 
organism from the tomato, and were successful in getting fine 
growths on nutrient agar in Petri dishes. In order to be certain 
that our culture was the right organism, we inoculated several to- 



TOMATOES. 4U1) 

matoes with a loop full of the bacteria from the pure culture, and 
were successful in transplanting the disease. We found, however, 
that we could not communicate the disease to perfect tomatoes with- 
out puncturing the skin. When the bacteria were simply spread 
over the surface of the skin, they remained dormant or dried up 
without inducing the disease. We are at a loss, however, to know 
how to apjily a remedy for the black rot in the patch of toniatos. 
We have noticed that this disease is more frequent in either ex- 
tremely dry or in extremely wet weather. .In dry weather the toma- 
toes are frequently attacked by insects and the bacteria which are re- 
sponsible for black rot thus gain an entrance through the perforated 
skin. Sometimes after a rain the sun will come out very brightly 
and the skins will crack open under the influence of the lieat, thus 
affording a means of invasion by bacteria.

In extremely wet weather the plants are sometimes knocked 
down and the tomatoes rest on the v\et ground where they are at- 
tacked by worms and various insects and bacteria may set up the 
di.sease through the perforations thus made in the skin. The black 
rot disease sometimes works its way entirely through the tomato, de- 
stroying it. Frequently only a portion is affected, and this is re- 
moved, of course, when the tomatoes are peeled. When tomatoes 
are intended for catsup, all such diseased places have to be cut with 
a knife, because black rot disease will permeate the whole batch of 
pulp, and black specks in thegoods-uih result. While we are not

able to suggest any means of destroying tlie bacteria which are re- 
sponsible for such widespread destruction of tomatoes as we scMne- 
times see. it is interesting to know just what organisms are responsi- 
ble, and gives us a means of studying the problem of overcoming 
these losses. The accompanying plate gives a microscopic view of 
the black rot bacilli as they appear when magnified 1,200 diameters. 
The colonies of this germ are of a slightly yellow color, even 
bordered. The streak culture on agar is somewhat lustrous and 
yellowish in color, after a time becoming darker, deepening into al- 
most a brown. The organism is not motile, and so far as we were 
able to study its characteristics, it does not form spores. We in- 
tend to study the morphological and biological characteristics of 
the tomato black rot bacillus, and endeavor to find some means of 
protecting the maturing tomatoes in the patch when this disease is 
rampant.

The case of tomatoes arrived at the laboratory and a pretty 
thorough examination was made of every can and particularly ihe 
solder. Some of the solder, when viewed through a sixteen milli- 
meter objective, had a honeycombed appearance. Solder made in 
the proportion of thirty tin and seventy lead is not fit for either can 
making, capping or tipping. Solder used in can making ought to

be about half and half and that used for capping and tipping forty 
tin and sixty lead. Solder made with seventy per cent lead would 
necessarily be much weaker than that which contained a greater per 
cent of tin, and then again such solder is liable to impart traces of 
lead to the canned product. A complete report of these cans is 
here appended :

Cultures were made of the bacteria found in some of the doubt- 
ful cans and in every case the bacteria were not spore-bearing, but 
belonged generally to the acetic acid varieties. Pure cultures were 
made of these and a ten per cent alcohol solution was inoculated 
with some of the culture, which rapidly attacked the alcohol and 
converted it into acetic acid. The germs which were found in these 
cans are freely distributed in the air and no doubt gained entrance 
through the leaks. The time which is given in the letter for two 
and three-pound tomatoes is really more than is necessary. Thirty- 
five to forty minutes for No. 3 tomatoes ought to sterilize them 
perfectly. Tomatoes need not he exhausted. They will keep all 
right if the process of sterilization is sufficient. It is customary 
to add about five minutes' more time for cold-packed tomatoes. 
In order to have the ends snap back after sterilization when canning 
cold-packed tomatoes, it is necessary to hasten the work after the 
tomatoes are scalded. The peeling, filling and capping must be 
done with great rapidity in order to prevent fermentation with the

formation of even small quantities of carbonic acid gas which will 
prevent the ends of the cans from snapping back after the process. 
If there is any delay between the scalding and the processing', fer- 
mentation will begin, particularly when the thermometer is in the 
nineties, and of course carbonic acid gas is formed in this fermenta- 
tion.

ANOTHER CASE OF Sl'OII.AGE. 



We investigated the cause of the spoilage of tomatoes from 
the six cans expressed to the laboratory. First we examined these 
cans carefully for leaks and found them absolutely well sealed and 
no leaks in any part of them. We then sterilized the surface of the 
tin by using a Bnnsen flame, then with a sterile awl we punched 
holes in the cans and took out some of the tomato juice on a sterile 
platiniun loop and inoculated dishes and tubes containing nutrient 
agar, also other tubes containing sterile tomato juice. The cans 
contained much gas and the juice Iwiled out of them freely after 
they were punctured. We examined some of this juice under the 
microscope and found it full of bacteria, some of them motile, others 
having no distinct motion. We examined the fermented tomatoes. 
and found that the seeds still retained the gelatinous substance which

is found surrounding the seeds in raw tomatoes. This settled the 
fact that the tomatoes had received very little heating. Ko camied 
tomatoes will keep if the gelatinous substance is not cooked loose 
from the seeds. The heat actually required to destroy the bacteria 
found in tomatoes will always loosen the substance mentioned. 

We frequently find that the heat has not been sufficient to de- 
stroy the life of the seeds, in which case they will grow if planted. 
One of the best ways of determining whether tomatoes are sucffi- 
ciently processed, is to note whether the gelatinous substance has 
been cooked loose from the seeds. Any process short of accom- 
plishing this is insufficient to destroy the bacteria associated with 
the spoilage of tomatoes. In order to determine about what pro- 
cess these tomatoes had actually received, we began the work of ob- 
taining pure cultures of the bacteria found in the cans. Four of the 
cans contained bacteria which would not grow in the presence of 
air ; they were obligative anaerobes, and it was necessary for us to 
grow them in tubes from which the oxygen of the air was entirely 
excluded; this we did in the following manner: We inoculated 
agar containing 2 per cent glucose solidified in the form of slants 
in test-tubes, (nearly all anaerobic bacteria thrive better in media 
containing glucose), these tubes were placed in larger tubes con- 
taining a mixture of pyrogallic acid and sodium hydroxid, which 
rapidly absorbs the oxygen after the outer tube is hermetically 
sealed. 

From two of the cans we could get pure cultures of aerobic 
bacteria. One of these was the beautiful red pigment bearing ba- 
cilkis prodigiosus, sometimes found on bread, rice, and other cereal>. 
It produces a beautiful red color. The other aerobe was also a 
chromogenic bacterium which produced a color of light orange. 
These two species were actively motile, particulary the last men- 
tioned. 

All of the bacteria isolated are species very easily destroyed 
by heat, none of them being able to withstand 210 degrees Fahr.. 
and the conclusion we reached was, that these cans had not been 
processed long enough for even t8o degrees of heat to reach the 
center of the contents. Just what the conditions were, we cannot 
say. since we were not present, but there cannot be any question 
of the correctness of our conclusions because the bacteria present 
in the tomatoes will perish at 180 degrees Fahr., and the natural 
condition of the seeds is evidence that no high temperature ever 
reached the center of the can. 

It is necessary in using any processing system, to see that the 
goods are subjected to the required temperature for the time nec- 
essary to accomplish sterilization, and the accomplishment of this 



TOMATOES. 416 

end is under control of the operator, whether working with the or- 
dinary cooking vats or kettles, or with a continuous conveying sys- 
tem. 

SWELLED TOMATOES. 

We have received several samples of swelled tomatoes, the 
cause of which we find is due to leaky cans. The following is a 
sample : 

When the samples of swelled tomatoes reached us several cans 
were burst in the seams and the contents were gone. We took a 
can which had no apparent leak and after incubating it examined the 
juice and found two species of bacteria present. One was the 
acetic acid bacterium and the other was a very actively motile bacil- 
lus which we were able to cultivate in pure culture only on tomato 
agar at first. We could not get a growth on the regular beef juice 
agar at first, but after two subcultures we were able to get a fine 
growth. This is a remarkable peculiarity of some bacteria, they 
become accustomed to a certain kind of food and do not readily 
thrive when streaked on a new substance. This is a well known 
characteristic of many pathogenic organisms ; they will grow quite 
well in the body, but when planted on artificial media they grow but 
scantily at first, but after several subcultures they multiply very 
readily and to some extent lose some of their pathogenic character- 
istics and become saphrophytic. Another peculiarity of this to- 
mato bacillus was, after we had made several subcultures, we were 
unable to get a good growth on tomato juice again, but on tomato 
juice which had fermented it grew quite well. This would indicate 
that it had nothing to do with the first fermentation, but found a 
suitable substance after that fermentation on which it could thrive 
luxuriantlv. 

Microscopical appearance. Large, straight rods three to six 
times as long as broad, with square ends, and forms chains com- 
posed of several cells. The rods are beautifully flagellated, having 
many of these organs of locomotion attached to the entire surface. 
The bacillus looks something like bacillus megatherium, but dif- 
fers from it in several points, its active motility, the rods are not 
bent, the ends are square, and it has more flagella. 

The spores of this bacillus are small and centrally located in 
the rods, they are very resistant to heat, and could not be destroyed 
by the temperatures usually given tomatoes for sterilization. As 
we have said, however, it will not thrive readily on unfermented to- 
matoes, consequently we are not usually troubled with it, unless we 
permit the peeled tomatoes to stand too long before they are pro- 
cessed, or until fermentation has started. 



CANNING AND PKE3EBVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 



TOMATOES. 417 

For a time we were unable to determine just why this organ- 
ism was present in the can examined, but we finally came to the 
conclusion that there must be a leak in the can somewhere, so we 
soldered up the hole, then we attached a check valve and pumped 
about 25 pounds of air into the empty can. We then placed the 
can under water and there were several fine streams of air bubbles 
which came from the leaks, which were invisible to the eye.

The history of corn packing dates back to the year 1839, 
when Isaac Winslow began his experiments. Our readers are re- 
ferred to the historical sketch by Mr. F. O. Conant, of Portland, 
Me., in "Science and Experiment as Applied to Canning," p. 13. 

Probably nothing in the canning line has given the canners 
more trouble than corn. It seems that it is liable to be invaded at 
times by extremely resistant forms of bacteria. In the early his- 
tory of corn-packing, Winslow was able to sterilize his cans by 
simply boiling them in water for several hours. The history of 
his successes and failures, and not onlv his, but also his contem- 
poraries, makes interesting reading. When the boiling temperature 
ceased to be effective, the cans were subjected to 235-240° for an 
hour or more, and this temperature seemed to give good satisfac- 
tion for a long time. It subsequently failed, however, and the 
canners had complaints of the corn turning sour. 

Among the first investigators to study this problem along sci- 
entific lines were Mr. Prescott and Mr. Underwood, of the Biologi- 
cal Department of the Boston School of Technology. At a meeting 
of the Atlantic State Packers' Association held at Buffalo in Febru- 
ary, 1898. these two gentlemen made known the results of their 
investigations. These papers were full of interesting and valuable 
information. 

A great deal of the souring of corn results from two different 
processes, one where the souring had been accomplished prior to 
sterilization and the other where the same phenomenon was noticed 
in the cans after sterilization, and this was due to living organism^ 
which had not been killed in the process. Strange to say, the de- 
composition took place witliout the evolution of any gas. The 



CORN. 419 

sugar in the corn was converted into lactic acid, in some cases, 
butyric acid and valeric acid, and there was formed sulphuretted 
hydrogen in various amounts. It was found necessary to increase 
the process of corn up to 250^ F. for sixty-five minutes. In some 
cases even this temperature has proved ineffective, but if the con- 
sistency is correct this heat will kill all spores. 

As a general proposition, then, we can say that ^250° for sixty- 
five minutes is a safe process for corn if it is not too dry. There 
must be enough fluid to carry the temperature from the parts near- 
est the tin to the center. If there is not enough fluid to do this, 
an impenetrable wall will form within the can, and the spores (in 
the center of the cans) will not be subjected to the temperature 
which registers on the retort, and consequently may live through 
any process. 

Some canners are reported a's being in the habit of using sul- 
phites for bleaching purposes. This practice is extremely danger- 
ous for several reasons. First, sulphites will attack the tin plate of 
poor quality and cause dark discoloration in the corn. Second, 
such corn has a sickly, unnatural appearance. Third, state food 
chemists are liable to condemn such goods as illegal, and thus bring 
discredit upon the whole industry. It is reported that some pack- 
ers have been using saccharin for sweeting purposes instead of cane 
sugar. Saccharin has been declared injurious by some authorities, 
although I have never heard of any experiments being made to 
determine the truth of the statement. A favorite argument of 
food experts is that saccharin is a fraud, it is used as a substitute 
for cane sugar, and therefore is an adulterant in the eyes of the 
law. We cannot enter into argument, but it might be well to cease 
using saccharin until some definite understanding is reached on this 
point. 

Corn, when it is delivered at the factory, should be worked up 
as rapidly as possible. It is the custom in some houses to pack 
two grades — a first and a second grade. Frequently, the whole 
first grade is run through while the corn intended for the second 
grade is piled up in great heaps. These heaps may remain long 
enough to have lactic decomposition set in, and sour corn will surely 
result, because the lactic acid formed in the corn can never be cooked 
out again by any sterilizing process. Corn, when delivered at the 
factory, contains a large number of spore-bearing bacteria of vari- 
ous kinds on the husks, on the silk and between the kernels of corn. 
When the corn is husked and run through the corn cutter these 
spores are thoroughly mixed in with the corn. The corn goes 
through the silking machines and then into the cooker and all of 
the fully developed bacilli are destroyed by the cooking, but the 
spores are not — they go into the cans and into the final process, and 



420 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

that process must be about 250° for sixty-five minutes in order 
to insure perfect sterilization. 

The calcium system offers some improvement over the retort 
for sterilization because the cans are somewhat agitated while going 
through the bath. This system is cheaper than any other and is 
attended with less steam and general inconvenience than the regular 
retort. In the following pages we will give some actual laboratory 
work done on spoiled corn and the results obtained, and this will be 
valuable to the canner. 

The following is an extract of an address delivered before the 
canners at Columbus, O., in February, 1905. 

Of all canned goods, corn seems to have given the packer more 
trouble than anything else — there were eighteen separate investiga- 
tions of spoiled corn — and it w^ill, no doubt, be interesting for us 
to draw some conclusion from the experience w^e have had with so 
many different cases of spoilage. 

If you will remember, last year I stated that in nine cases out 
of ten the 

CAUSE OF SOUR CORN 

was due to the souring of the raw material before it was canned. 
While this statement was true at that time, it is not true today. 
The majority of the cans of spoiled corn investigated during this 
year at the laboratory, were sour on account of incomplete steriliza- 
tion. There were two or three cases only of sour corn which had 
soured previous to the sterilizing process. Let us state the nature 
of this spoilage : In the first place we find that there are two dis- 
tinct forms of spoilage due to insufficient sterilization. 

In one, the can swells and the contents become putrid, the pres- 
sure of gas sometimes exceeding 35 to 40 pounds, to the square 
inch. We made a very interesting experiment to determine the 
pressure necessary to burst a certain make of cans, as follows : We 
attached the can to a steam autoclav, or steam retort, and raised 
the pressure gradually up to 30 pounds without bursting the can. 
We were afraid to raise it any higher for fear of some accident, but 
we are satisfied that it would have required at least 35 to 40 pounds' 
pressure to burst the can. 

The bursting of the cans is quite a common phenomenon seen 
in piles of corn, so that the pressure produced by the bacteria, which 
are responsible for the process of decomposition, is probably more 
than 35 or 40 pounds. Bacteria, which produce gas in canned com. 
are generally, although not always, anaerobic ; that is, they will not 
grow in the presence of air. Most of this species are common in 
the soil and in decomposing organic matter. There is another class 
of germs which produce gas and cause the spoilage of com; these 



CORN. 421 

are aerobic; that is, they are able to grow in the presence of oxy- 
gen. Both of these varieties produce spores of great vitality. 

The other form of spoilage is a souring of the contents of the 
can without any outward appearance of the trouble within. Some- 
times these goods when opened taste remarkably well on the surface, 
but in the center they are putrid and the odor is abominable. This 
class of germs is generally aerobic, and the spores are probably more 
resistant to high temperatures than the gas producers. 

These bacteria certainly give the canner considerable trouble, 
because the cans do not swell, and it is a very tedious and trouble- 
some matter to pick out those cans which are good and those which 
are bad. 

The following test gave excellent results in one case where it 
was carried out carefully: The cold cans of corn are put in the 
steam retort and the temperature was raised to 240 degrees, and 
maintained so for 65 minutes. They were then taken out of the 
retorts as soon as the pressure ran down, and put into cold water for 
five minutes. They were then piled out in rows so that both ends 
were visible. After three or four hours manv of the ends were 
drawn in ; these were sorted out and heated for about seven minutes 
at 150 degrees — all cans which did not swell in this temperature 
\\ere good. Any which showed slight swelling were somewhat 
affected. Some of the cans were swelled on one end, while the other 
end had drawn in ; some of these when again heated did not swell, 
and were good. All cans w'hich do not swell in this second heating 
can be marketed as first-class goods. The balance are affected more 
or less and are probably a total loss. 

I will explain the cause of this peculiar phenomenon. The 
bacteria which cause the souring and putrefaction of canned corn 
without swelling cans produce a substance called sulphuretted hy- 
drogen. This is a gas which is taken up by liquids and does not 
affect the vacuum until it has saturated the liquid, when the surplus 
will cause the swelling of the can. It rarely happens, however, 
that it will be formed in sufficient quantities to cause the swelling, 
and as fast as it is generated it is usually absorbed by the fluid. 
When the cans are put into a retort and the temperature brought up 
to 250 degrees for 65 minutes the heat expands the gas and it is lib- 
erated from the fluid so that it will force both ends out and will not 
be absorbed again by the liquid until it has become quite cold. 
I'^sually there is enough gas left unabsorbed to destroy the vacuum 
and this will leave the ends puffed out somewhat even after cooling. 

Nearly every packer who has experienced losses of this kind 
has noticed that a large number of cans are not thus affected. These 
good cans are scattered throughout the pile in various percentages. 
Now, the question comes up, why is it that a certain proportion will 



422 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

spoil while the balance will be good? Why is it that the process 
was sufficient in one case to destroy the resistant formij of bacteria 
and was not sufficient in the otlier case? All the cans were run 
through the same process and were treated apparently in the same 
manner all through the \arious processes of manufacture, and yet 
some of them will spoil and some of them will be good. 

Whenever spoilage occurs in any kind of goods this phenom- 
enon is generally noticed, and the reason for this may be thus ex- 
plained : It is generally due to variation in the consistency. 

A careful study was made of the consistency of different cans 
of corn in the various cases of spoilage investigated. A\'here the 
corn was quite dry and very little juice was present, bacteria seemed 
not to have been destroyed. Corn is not easily penetrated by heat. 
The kernels which lie next to the tin are heated very soon after 
the proper temperature is registered on the retort thermometer; 
probably the kernels next to them are heated sufficiently; then we 
can imagine a sort of impenetrable wall of corn all around the can 
which takes up nearly all the heat and prevents it from penetrating 
to the center of the can. In the center of the can are numbers of 
si)ores; these spores gain entrance to the corn in the mixer and 
cooker ; they are not destroyed in the cooker and pass through the 
filling machines into the cans without being harmed in the least. 
These spores in the center of the can, surrounded and protected as 
they are by an impenetrable wall of corn, withstand temperatures 
registered on the retort thermometer which would otherwise be suf- 
ficient to destrov all life. If there were iust a sufficient amount of 
juice to flow in between the grains of corn and penetrate to the 
center, this juice would carry the heat necessary to destroy spore 
life; 250 degrees Fahrenheit for ten to fifteen minutes will abso- 
lutely destroy the most resistant spores known, and all that is re- 
quired is to add to this time the number of minutes necessary for 
that temperature to register at the center of the can. I would make 
the suggestion, therefore, that the canners adopt a rule of adding a 
certain quantity of brine to each can in order to insure sufficient 
moisture to carry the heat to all parts of the can. 

USE OP* STARCH DANGEROUS. 

There may be some packers who use a little starch in order to 
gi^•e the corn a creamy consistency. In the light of what we have 
said, this practice may be considered dangerous, because starch will 
interfere with the fluidity. Xearly every packer knows the result 
of delays prior to sterilization. Sour corn results from piling the 
husked corn in heaps, where it becomes heated. There were only 
two cases of sour corn from delavs of this kind, and we take it for 
granted that the packers ha\'e become familiar with the dangers of 
unnecessary delays before sterilization.

GitNTLKMEN : — We are making you an express shipment pre- 
paid today of i dozen cans corn, on the bottoms of which some are 
marked "G" for good, and some "S" for sour. 

We wish you to make an examination of tJiese goods and let 
us have your report as to what you find. .\\] these goods were 
processed exactly the same, viz. : 63 minutes at 250 degrees F., with 
hot water and steam combined, and we would like to knoiv why it 
is in the condition it is. 

\Vhen the samples of sour corn arrived we made culture pre- 
parations, and inoculated them with the juice from each can, taken 
under aseptic precautions. The culture dishes showed no growth

of bacteria, except from two cans; the balance were incubated at 
98° F., until the agar dried up. but no colonies made their appear- 
ance. From two cans, however, we obtained a number of colonies 
and upon examination we found that s'lme of these were micrococci, 
and ordinary lactic acid bacteria, which could not possibly withstand 
any sterilization commonly given canned corn. Fven boiling tem- 
perature destroys these bacteria. Our idea was at first that the cul- 
tures were contaminations from the air, and we discarde<l these and 
prepared another set of dishes and obtained similar results. We

therefore concluded that we must have exposed the juice to the air 
and reasoned that the cans were contaminated by some carelessness 
or oversight in our manipulations. We therefore opened all the 
cans and examined the contents. All were sweet and good except- 
ing the two cans from which we had obtained cultures. The juice 
in these cans seemed to have a watery and airdled appearance, the 
thin fluid presenting a faintly bluish cast by diffused light. We ex- 
amined the soldering of these cans critically, looking for pin hole 
leaks, but none were found, so we began the search over the sur- 
face of the tin for imperfections and perforations. On the outside 
of the cans there were numerous rust spots having dark centers, 
and we found various places where the tin was perforated with ex- 
ceedinglv small holes. The photomicrographs show three holes.

one was taken from the inside surface and the other from the out- 
side surface directly opposite from each other, under a magnification 
of 200 diameters. 

This discovery, of course, cleared up the mysterious appear- 
ance of the non-sporulating varieties of bacteria which made their 
appearance in the Petri dishes. Not satisfied with this investiga- 
tion, we notified the packers to forward another lot of cans, and 
upon receipt of these we prepared a large number (about 30) of 
Petri dishes, using as a medium for cultivating the bacteria, pure 
sweet corn juice containing i^-S per cent agar, marking each dish 
with the number indicated on the can from which it was taken. 
After twenty-four hours the dishes from several cans contained 
very small colonies, and after several hours more we were able to 
isolate the bacteria.

426 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

One colony, first examined, was i^erfectly round, evenly bord- 
ered, very dark in the center, shaded down to a yellow near the edge, 
under a magnification of 60 diameters by transmitted light. 

The natural size was about one millimeter in diameter, and had 
a lustrous bluish cast with a dark spot in the center. This proved 
to be the lactic acid bacillus and numerous similar colonies after- 
wards made their appearance. We have shown the illustration 
(of lactic acid bacteria) see Plate 39. This was from a perforated 
can. 

Another colony was examined which resembled the above very 
closely except that it had a crumby appearance. It looked as if it 
had broken glass or sand sprinkled over the surface. We made a 
streak culture of this organism and found that it was a motile spore 
bearing bacillus, which produced no gas. It grew rapidly over the 
surface and seemed to grow downward into the agar as well as 
over the surface, the center of the growth being covered with small 
wrinkled folds, while the extendino- laver was verv thin and almost 
transparent. The organism grew well both as an aerobe and as an 
anaerobe, but in the last named condition seemed to produce more 
acid, w^hich was something like phosphoric acid, ver}' sour. The 
growth on corn juice was rapid with no gas, and the juice seemed 
to present the same curdled appearance noticed on opening the cans 
of sour corn. 

The rods begin to form spores after the second day and when 
examined in the living state a degeneration of the cell may be ob- 
served, the protoplasm becoming less homogeneous, and sporangic 
granules are seen as is the case during plasmolysis. After a time 
the granules seem to collect and a bright shining spot appears near 
one end of the rod, and this spot seems to take on a definite shape; 
it is the spore forming within the cell. Our photomicrograph 
shows some of these rods which have the spores within. There are 
a number of rods which are barren, that is to say. they will not pro- 
duce spores; such rods are met with in nearly all cultures. The 
membranes of these spores are quite thick and are able therefore 
to withstand high temperatures, or other unfavorable conditions, 
and afterwards develop into vegetating rods when conditions of en- 
vironment are favorable. In order to give the packers some idea 
of the size of such spores, it would take about 25,000 of them 
placed side by side to measure one inch ; it would take 200 of them, 
placed end to end, to reach across a hair. An ordinary pin hole leak 
in a tin can is large enough to admit 50.000 of these spores at one 
time if that many could be collected and crowded together. The 
photomicrographs of the various sj^ecies are magnified from 1,000 
to 1,500 diameters, which is a real magnification of from one to 
two and a half million times, so that our readers can appreciate the

extreme delicacy of the photographers's work, which must be done 
through the microscope, everything being absolutely quiet and the 
brightest radiant possible. The can from which bacillus Mesenteri- 
cus FiiscHS was taken was not a leak, but the sterihzation was in- 
comptete. 

In another can of sour corn wc found another kind of organism 
associated with the bacillus just described. We designated this as 
bacilhis Liodermos. 

After twenty-four hours, fine water points appeared on the 
surface of the culture medium, and as they grew older these colonies 
took on a reddish yellow color at a magnification of (>o diametef? by

transmitted light. Naturally the colonies are about 2 m. ni. in diam- 
eter aiid round, somewhat elevated, but when magnified slight 
growths can be seen extending outward from the periphery. The 
agar streak culture is a moistly shining, dirty layer, with a thin, 
pimctuated, transparent growth pushing ahead of the older streak. 
This layer rapidly e.vtends to the walls of the di.sh even up the sides 
for a short distance. Tlie bacilli are about 3 to 6 ^ long, 
having numerous hair-like organs of locomotion. They form chains

and have a tendency to collect in bunches, being matted together, 
hekl, no doubt, by interlaced flagella. Our photomicrograph shows 
them tlius connected. Tins bacilhis produces butyric acid and sul- 
phuretted hydrogen, but no gas. When we tasted the juice of this 
can it was somewhat disagreeable, having not only a sour taste but 
a flavor not at all pleasant. 

This bacillus forms spores which are located at the center of the 
rods, and are extremely resistant to high temperature. We have 
reserved a culture of them in the laboratory for further study. 

One can contained, with others, a bacillus which produced a 
bitter principle not unlike that of raw peas. The juice of this can

Can Xo. I, and when the colonies began to grow we noted other 
varieties previously examined, also this one. which is designated as 
Bacilhis Bittergcnus. 

The colonies were alt deeply imbedded in the agar, none at all 
appearing on the surface, whicli indicates that it favors an anaerobic 
condition. The streak also had a tendency to grow downward into 
the medium. The deep colonies were opaque, granular and brown. 
When planted in sweet corn juice a bitter flavor was imparted. The 
spores are medium.

CONCLUSIONS. 

The cans used for this lot of corn had a very inferior coating 
of tin, and we would recommend a better quality of tin plate for 
packing corn. 

The process of 250° F. for 63 minutes would seem to be suf- 
ficient if the circulation were ail right. We do not regard a steam 
and water process as reliable as dry steam, for the reason that water 
has not as good circulation as dry steam. The same process with 
dry steam and free exhaust will undoubtedly sterilize the corn per- 
fectly. 

This process will discolor corn slightly unless the cans are 
chilled with cold water. Our experience has been that the best way 
to accomplish this is to run cold water into the retorts through the 
lid before opening them, when the temperature falls to about 220^ 
P. 

We w'ould recommend that the use of saccharin be discon- 
tinued, because it is illegal in many states, and canned goods or any 
other food containing this sweetener, are liable to be analyzed and 
condemned by the authorities. 

Mr. E. W. Dl■CKw^\LL, 
Aspinwall, Pa. 

Dear Sir: — We have been surprised to learn that some of our 
corn has turned sour. Only one or two cans in a case have been 
discovered so far and they are among the solid pack of 1903. We 
are sending you by express prepaid several cans which may be sour. 
We would like to have you make a bacteriological examination of 
these, and would be pleased to hear the results. We have been pro 
cessing at 245° F. for sixty-five minutes, but this is probably tcx*) 
low. Would you advise us to increase it to 250° F., as you sug- 
gest in your writings? Awaiting your reply, we remain. 

Yours verv trulv. 



Only two cans were found to be sour in the case of goods re- 
ceived, and we made plate cultures of the juice by streaking a 
number of Petri dishes containing nutrient corn juice agar. With- 
in thirty-six hours we had a number of colonies, many of which 
were the same. We found only two colonies which showed any 
marked difference. These we transplanted into bouillon, and pelli- 
cles formed rapidly on the surface, one being much more wrinkled 
than the other, growing fast to the w-alls of the tube, and not easily 
precipitated by shaking. 



From the bouillon culture we streaked new culture plates, and 
obtaineu a rapidly spreading growth in eight hours, which was 
composed of very motile bacteria. From this growth we obtained 
a slide preparation and stained it for flagelia. 

The central portion grew much elevated with folded white 
inkles ; from these we were able to get a specimen of the spores.

which resembled other varieties previously examined. The spores 
had very thick walls and were thus well protected against heat or 
other unfavorable conditions. This organism seemed to curdle the 
corn juice giving it a greyish color, and the water seemed to sep- 
arate from the juice quite freely. It was possible to detect this 
watery condition by shaking the along with one not so affected. 

The other bacillus corresponded to one previously described 
(see Plate 165). 

SPOILED CORX. 

The following letter explains itself: 

Mr. E. W. Duckwall, 
Aspinwall, Pa. 

Dear sir : — Wt are expressing you today, prepaid, four cans, 
two bulged, one good, and one empty, for examination. Please 
advise us wherein the trouble lies. Is it a lack of sterilization, 
faulty cans or our water supply? We use a standard formula, 
cooking one hour and twenty minutes at 240°. Our water supply 
comes from a driven well 178 feet deep. Do you consider the good 

can safe?

Verv truly vours. 



The four cans reached the laboratory, but the contents of one 
had been lost on the way. We punctured the other swells with a 
sterilized awl, and after the escape of fermenting corn juice and 
malodorous gases, we inoculated several Petri dishes and bouillon 
tubes with some of the juice taken from the can, imder as nearly 
aseptic conditions as possible. We had a fine growth of bacteria 
in all of the tubes and dishes. After diluting the bouillon we 
streaked several Petri dishes, and obtained colonies sufficiently sep- 
arated for isolation. One of these organisms was described under 
plate 169. The bouillon culture formed a pellicle on the surface 
and this became very much wrinkled. The plate culture spread 
rapidly, a thin, transparent growth of bacteria extending in all di- 
rections from the line of inoculation. This organism produced no 
gas in any of the cultures made, and when transplanted into cans 
of corn caused them to turn sour, without the formation of gas or 
swelling of the can. It forms spores, centrally located in the rods. 
and when these are set free they become extremely resistant to 
high temperatures and are able to withstand 245 degrees F. for 65 
minutes, and in this case withstood a temperature of 240 degrees 
for 80 minutes. This was the process mentioned by the packer in 
his letter. 



CORN. 433 

The other bacilUis formed gas quite freely, anti sulphuretted 
hydrogen was also formed, and the bouillon culture gave the indol 
reactions. The foul odor noticed when we opened the can was due 
to tliese two products. The bacillus is a spore bearing, actively mo- 
tile organisms and formed a pellicle on the surface of the bouillon, 
and caused the fermentation of grai>e sugar bouillon and corn juice. 
It is endowed with numerous flagella, which grow out from the 
entire surface of the cells, and these are the cause of its active mo- 
tility. The colonies on agar are round and greyish white, at first 
lustrous, then becoming more wrinkled and folded. The periphery

strated in the streak culture on the surface of nutrient agar in 
Petri dishes. The spores are located r.earer one end of the rod. and 
when set free are very resistent to high teinperatm^es. as was evident 
from their having passed through a process of 240 degrees F. for 
80 minutes. The cans inoculated with the spores of this organism 
were perfectly sterilized when given a process of 250 degrees F. for 
65 minutes. 

In sterilizing corn we believe that 250 degrees F. should be 
used in preference to the lower temperature. It requires about 50 
to 55 minutes for this temperature tn reach the center of a No. 2 
can, and it requires about 10 minutes' cxixisurc to this temperature 
to insure devitalization of the spores of such bacteria as are shown 
in the accompanying plates. It is barely possible that this time 



434 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

could be cut down a few minutes if the cans are agitated during 
sterilization, but corn is almost impervious to heat, and those ker- 
nels which are nearest the tin are sterilized in far less time than 
those at the center, so that agitation would have a tendency to bring 
the corn in the center nearer the in at times. A temperature of 250 
degrees does darken the color a trifle, but if the proper cooling pro- 
cess is employed, the color will be very good, and while not as white 
as corn bleached with sulphites, is good enough for any market. 
Some of the cans sent to the laboratory for inspection have had very 
good color after this process. The good can appears to be all 
right ; up to this time it has not swelled in a temperature of 98 de- 
grees F. 

DISCOLORATION OF CORN. 

Nation AT, Canners' Laboratory, 
Aspinwall, Pa. 

Gentlemen : — We are sending you via express today four 
cans corn.. A\'e wish you to analyze same and kindly write us as 
soon as possible cause for their being curdled like and black in cap 
end of can. Corn looks good except on capped end. Our whole 
pack seems to be in same shape. We have taken these cans from 
four different weeks' pack. 

Yours verv truly. 



When the cans arrived w^e placed all excepting one in the incu- 
bator for a week in order to get a growth of any bacteria which 
might be present. After that time we removed them and streaked 
a number of Petri dishes containing a nutrient agar preparation. 
We examined the juice carefully, but could find no trace of bacteria 
at that time. We naturally thought that the cans contained no bac- 
teria, because we could not see any under the microscope, but we 
obtained a free growth in the Petri dishes within twenty-four hours. 
We then examined the cans again and found that in two of them the 
bacteria had developed wonderfully. We did not get any growth 
from one can, either in the can or in the dishes, so this can was 
sterile. These bacteria were strictly aerobic, that is, they were able 
to grow only in the presence of air, and this accounted for our fail- 
ure to make them multiply in the cans during the first incubation. 
We endeavored to grow^ them in the anaerobic culture apparatus, 
but were unsuccessful, and this proved that they were strict aerobes. 
There w^ere two different species, one in can marked No. i, and 



%\

another in can Xo. 3, and both were motile and spore bearing. We 
introthiced the spores into some catis of good corn we have in the 
laboratory, then processed them ; «-ithin a week we had the same 
discoloration seen in the originals. This would indicate that the bac- 
teria were able to grow as long as there was any oxygen in the can, 
and after that they would form spores and the rods would dissolve.

leaving only free spores which we were unable to detect positively 
in the juice under the microscope. 

The bacillus found in can No. i was beautifully llagellated, 
which gave it very active motility. It is strictly aerobic and differs 
from any bacillus thus far isolated by us. In appearance it greatly 
resembles bacillus mesentericus vulgatus. It forms long chains and 
some of these would be motile and flagellated. After a time spores 
would form near one end of the rods and the rods would dissolve 
rapidly, leaving the spores free.

extended in all directions and soon reaches the walls of the dish. 
From this almost invisible growth fine preparation may be obtained 
for the demonstration of the flagella. After the growth becomes 
quite visible it is slimy, and in this resembles the potato bacillus. It 
forms a pellicle on the surface of bouillon, but does not produce any 
gas. It forms a small amount of sulphuretted hydrogen, which is 
determined as follows: The agar is colored a light yellow with 
ferrifatrate made alkaline with sodium carbonate: the bacteria cause

this to turn black if sulphuretted hydrogen is produced. It is this 
substance which gives the com the dark discoloration seen fre- 
quently and was the direct cause in the case before us. 

The spores of this orj^anism are very resistant to heat, because 
they are thick membraned. A close study of the plate shows this 
characteristic. Nearly e\'ery rod forms spores and when we stained 
an old culture we rarely found any rods at ail, they all having gone 
to spores. 

This organism grows only in the presence of air, and when 
forced into an anaerobic condition forms spores and goes into a rest- 
ing state. For this reason it will not continue to grow in the sealed 



CORN. 437 

cans after the supply of oxygen is exhausted, consequently will not 
cause very great changes. 

The bacillus isolated from the can marked No. 3, was different 
in its manner of growth. When streaked on agar it grew only along 
the line of inoculation and did not send out the invisible film seen in 
the other culture. On ordinary agar we had difficulty in getting a 
confluent growth; it seemed to form colonies and resembled 
Hueppe's bacillus butyricus in this respect. It did not form any 
slime, but gave rise to spores rapidly. These spores are centrally 



located in the rods as a rule, although some of them were (|uite near 
the ends of the rods. There were a great many barren rods in the 
cultures we made, and many rods which did not form sjiores at 
all, as shown by the plate. The spores arc quite small, and the 
membrane does not seem to be as thick as that of the other species. 
This organism is also strictly aerobic, and cannot grow where oxy- 
gen is excluded. We went through the «anie technique as described 



438 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

previously and learned that sulphuretted hydrogen i\as produced, 
but only iu small amounts. It produced no indol or other foul pro- 
duct and formed no gas. Like the other species it developed and 
grew as long as there was any oxygen in the can and then went into 
a resting state. 

These are the first strictly aerobic bacteria we have ever iso- 
lated from canned corn, all the others have been facultative anae- 
rolws; that is, they were able to grow in the presence or absence of 
oxygen. That class of bacteria would of course continue to grow

tion. 

SOUR CORN. 

A packer called at the laboratory and stated that he had been 
losing quite heavily on one particular brand of his corn on account 
of sourness. He stated that there were other canners in his im- 
mediate vicinity who were also having similar trouble. 



CORN. 439 

This packer puts up a special grade of corn and his loss was 
confined to this grade. He said that he had not lost any of the reg- 
ular goods from "sours." The special grade he had put up in the us- 
ual manner and used granulated sugar as a sweetener, where form- 
erly he had used saccharin. He said that when he opened some of 
the cans they were quite sour and some had a putrefying odor. 
None of the cans showed any signs of swelling. He processed these 
goods 55 minutes at 240 degrees Fahr. and allowed about 20 min- 
utes' time for heating up to that temperature. He was very anxious 
to sort out the bad cans so that he might dispose of all that were 
good. He had tried in various ways to do this, but none of them 
proved reliable, so he came to the laboratory for advice. 

We requested him to send us a case of this corn for bacterio- 
logical examination. This he did. We advised him in the mean- 
time to heat his cans in boiling water until they all swelled. This 
we thought could be done in about 20 to 30 minutes, and our idea 
was to chill the cans quickly with cold water and all whose ends 
snapped back within a few minutes were to be sorted out as good 
cans and all which failed to snap back were to be considered bad 
cans. He acted on our advice and reported that among the cans 
whose ends snapped back quickly, he found quite a number which 
were sour, and among those which he had set aside as bad, he found 
quite a number which showed no evidence of sourness, then he 
stated that he was opening the cans now, and was tasting them, 
but he had taken a large number of cans which had been tasted, re- 
capped them and then put them into the retorts and given them a 
process of 250 degrees for 65 minutes. He stated that on opening 
some of these cans he found that they were very much discolored 
by the extra amount of cooking and also that quite a number had 
developed sourness in the process. This mystified him very much, 
but I told him that the sourness had vStarted in the center of the 
cans and had probably not extended to the surface, therefore it 
could not be detected by those who had tasted the corn before the 
cans were reprocessed. The processing thoroughly mixed the acid 
so that it w'as easily detected afterwards. 

I told him that where corn soured on account of the bacteria 
developing in the cans after incomplete sterilization, it usually 
started in the center of the cans, because at that point the heat had 
not been sufficient to destroy them. During the mixing of the 
corn, prior to the filling, the spores of the bacteria peculiar to corn 
are mixed in with the mass so that there are manv in the center of 
the cans. Some spores are destroyed at even moderate tempera- 
tures, but others will survive cooking for a long time, and unless 
the temperature used in sterilization is sufficiently high and pro- 
longed to reach the resistant spore forms in the center of the cans 



440 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

they will afterwards develop and the sourness will begin at the point 
where the bacteria began to grow. 

This cleared the matter up for him and he decided to subject 
all of his cans to a high temperature for a sufficient time to heat 
them through to the center, so he used a temperature of 240 degrees 
Fahr. for 65 minutes and this heat thoroughly penetrated the cans 
so that when they were removed both ends bulged out. The color 
of these goods was very fair considering the amount of cooking 
they had received, in fact, it was almost impossible to detect any 
difference in the color from that of the oriofinal. 

The question now arose in the packer's mind whether this sec- 
ond cooking would be sufficient to prevent bacterial action in those 
cans which he had sorted out as good ; also in those cans which he 
had sorted out and styled "push-backs." In order to determine 
this point he sent some of the latter into the laborator}\ We in- 
oculated Petri dishes and bouillon with some of the juice, and after 
thirty-six hours we failed to get any growth. It would seem there- 
fore that the second cooking had completely sterilized the cans. 
This was probably due to the fact that there were no spore forms 
present, all having developed into full-grown bacteria or vegetating 
forms, which are easily destroyed even at 180 degrees Fahr. 

This packer said that about 40 per cent of the cans had soured, 
and he was very much at a loss to know why that per cent had 
soured and the other 60 per cent were apparently good. We opened 
quite a number of cans in his presence and examined the consist- 
encv. We found that the consistencv varied considerablv. Some 
cans were very solid, having little fluid: others were quite moist, 
so that the fluid flowed back and forth between the particles of com: 
and there were still others whose consistency varied between these 
tw^o extremes. It is quite reasonable to suppose that the solid- 
packed corn would be less penetrable to heat than that which was 
more moist, but in the first place the temperature of 240 degrees 
Fahr. for ^^ minutes would not be a safe process for corn, and it 
is surprising that it did not all sour. We are of the opinion that 
this would have been the result finally, but owing to the temperature 
of the corn room being quite low, the putrefactive action was nec- 
essarily slow. Then again, the process given might have been suf- 
ficient in some cases where the spores were of less resistant char- 
acter. The process for corn should be 250 degrees Fahr. for 65 
minutes, not counting the time required to reach that degree of heat. 
By the calcium system, time for raising this temperature would 
have to be allowed, so that the total time for carrying cans through 
the calcium solution would be about 70 to 75 minutes. 

The following method of testing to separate sour from sweet 
corn has been used with much success by some packers, and while 



CORN. 441 

we are not called upon to guarantee its infallability, we have added 
an explanation of points w-hich would seem to indicate its reason- 
ableness. We should, however, be pleased to receive from any of 
our packer friends any data based on their experiences which would 
tend to throw any further light on this general subject. 

TKST FOR SEPARATING SOUR FROM SWEET CORN. 

Corn to be taken cold and put in steam kettles. Temperature 
to be run up in twenty minutes to 240 degrees; hold for sixty-five 
minutes at that point. Take out quickly as possible and put in cold 
water for five minutes. 

Take crates in warehouse, and by hand, lay cans on floor in 
rows carefully, so each end of can is exposed to view. After stand- 
ing in warehouse for four hours (temperature in warehouse to be 
50 degrees), go over cans and pick out all that have collapsed on 
both ends. Quickly run them through the hot tank at 148 degrees 
at feed end and not over 151 degrees at outlet of tank. Speed of 
cans through tanks, seven minutes. 

Such cans as pass through the hot tank undeveloped or not 
swelled to be set aside and called No. i collapse. Such cans as 
develop or swell when passing through hot tank to be set aside 
and called No. 2 collapse. 

Then go over balances of cans in warehouse immediately, and 
all cans that have swelled on one end only, or collapse with the 
pressure of the finger, put all such cans through the hot tank, same 
temperature and speed as collapses. All cans that pass through un- 
developed to be kept separate and called Xo. i push backs, and all 
cans that develop or swell to be set aside and called Xo. 2 push 
backs. 

After this second overhauling, all cans that remain on ware- 
house floor swelled at both ends to be set aside as spoiled and of no 
value. 

All cans known as X'o. i collapses to be considered first qual- 
ity, and all cans known as X'o. i push backs, to be considered first 
quality. All cans from Xo. 2 collapses, to be considered second 
grade corn and salable. 

X"o. I collapses, X'o. i push backs and Xo. 2 collapses, to be 
cooled immediately after coming out of hot tank, by laying on plat- 
form outside of building ; should lay sufiicicnt time to become thor- 
oughly cold, not frozen. 

Greatest care possible must be exercised in the handling of the 
cans so as not to prematurely do anything that will cause them to 
collapse on either end ; the collapsing must be natural, with the ex- 
ception that on the second over-hauling, such cans as are collapsed

on one end only, to be forced in : that is, such cans as will yield to 
the slight pressure of the fingers. 

Referring to the above mentioned system of sorting out sour 
corn from the good, we will explain how this may be judged as a 
reasonable method. In Plate 176 we have reproduced the bacteria 
which had caused the sour corn. These belong to a certain class of 
microbes which do not form gas; they attack the carbohydrates, 
principally the sugar of the corn, converting it into lactic acid, and 
also forming other complex substances such as indol, and sulphur- 
etted hydrogen which is taken up by the fluid and does not volatil-

ize into gas except under the influence of heat. These chemical 
changes may take place in a \acuum and no gas is produced, and 
there is no evidence whatever from the external appearance of the 
can of any such changes. When the packer heated his cans so that 
the high temperature penetrated to the center, the hydrogen sulphdie 
was driven into the form of a gas. and owing to this characteristic 
property, the bad cans were quite easily sorted out while the good 
cans which contained none of the (H;S) soon snapped back to 
their normal condition. 

During our conversation the packer asked me if it was not 
possible that the granulaled sugar he had used in this com, mi^il 
have had something to do with the souring. He stated that he had 



CORN. 443 

formerly used saccharin or "sugar crystals." as tlicy are called, and 
he had never had any such loss. He stated that it had been repre- 
sented to him that sugar would cause the souring of peas and corn, 
and he also stated that a certain salesman of chemicals had advised 
him never to use granulated sugar, or if he decided to use sugar 
at all, he ought to use "Franklin A" or Confectioners' ".\;" that 
granulated sugar contained impurities which might cause the sour- 
ing of his good. All such talk as this is mere theory. There is 
nothing in the facts to warrant such statements. The chemical re- 
ports on granulated sugar sho^v that it runs from 98 to 100 per cent 
pure, and a small amount of impurity would have nothing whatever 
to do with the spoilage of such goo;Is as corn or peas.

There are no extremely resistant forms of bacteria identified 
with the fermentation of sugar. Molds and yeasts will cause a fer- 
mentation of granulated sugar when combined with fruit juices, 
fruit pulps and tomato products, but these forms of life are easily 
destroyed at even boiling temperature. Granulated sugar is in it- 
self a preservative, and could not increase the risk of souring in 
goods which must receive as high a temperature as that which is 
given sugar corn for complete sterilization. The cause of spoilage 
in canned corn after sterilization, is always traceable to spore-bear- 
ing bacteria which are present in the corn itself before canning. 
The sugar could not have any influence one way or the other. It 
has been claimed that saccharin was a preservative and for that 
reason was preferable to granulated sugar, because it exercised 
antiseptic power on the bacteria, but this is not the case simply be- 



444 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

cause saccharin is used only in very limited quantities, quantities 
so small that it could not have any antiseptic influence. 

Preservatives are valuable only when used in sufficient amounts 
to prevent the multiplication of bacteria; when used in small 
amounts thev act rather as a stimulant, and are used sometimes in 
our culture media to stimulate the growth of certain species of bac- 
teria. Salicylic acid is frequently used in the isolation of the ty- 
phoid bacillus which grows readily when only a small amount of 
this chemical is employed. Saccharin even in very strong solu- 
tions has very little antiseptic power, and in the amount used for 
sweetening corn and peas its influence would be rather stimulative 
than antiseptic. 

Speaking of saccharin, we recall the heated controversy which 
took place at the International Food Congress in St. Louis between 
those who had investigated its action pharmacologically, and the 
Food Commissioners. The Food Commissioners looked upon sac- 
charin as a substitute for sugar, and they claim that it has no food 
value, that it passes through the body in an unchanged condition, 
and that if used for a long time it is apt to cause nephritis. That 
it does pass though the body in an unchanged condition, and that 
it is not a food, we cannot deny. As to its effect upon the human 
body, we cannot dispute their claims, because we have never made 
any experiments to determine the correctness of these assertions. 
We would advise packers, if we might be permitted to make a sug- 
gestion, that they be guarded in their use of saccharin this com- 
ing season, because the food commissioners are liable to enter suits 
against any grocers who sell canned goods containing this artificial 
sweetener, and the packers will have to come forward then and de- 
fend their customers. 

We are also under the impression, though we cannot state it 
as a positive fact, that saccharin would oxydize into salicylic acid 
in some cases where high temperatures are used to accomplish steril- 
ization of canned sfoods. It is not a verv difticult matter to deter- 
mine the presence of saccharin in canned corn and peas, the chemi- 
cal technique being similar to that used for determining the presence 
of salicvlic acid, nanielv, a chloroform or ether extract is made and 
the residue from this is converted into salicylic acid by subjecting 
it to a high temperature, 250 degrees C, with sodium hydroxide. 
The sodium salicylate thus formed is easily detected by the ferric 
chloride test and in order to confirm this the residue from another 
extraction is heated with resorcin and a few drops of sulphuric acid 
in a test tube till it begins to swell up. Several times heating and 
then neutralizing with sodium hydroxide will give a red-green 
fluorescence where saccharin is present. 



CORN. 445 

ANOTHER CASK. 

We were informed that one packer claimed to have a great 
deal of sour corn after using a process of 250 degrees Fahr. for 70 
minutes, but this does not seem likely to me. If such were the case, 
his corn must have been entirely too dry or solid-packed, and this is 
a very important matter. It must not be overlooked that sour corn 
is not always due to imperfect sterilization. \V' e all know that corn 
will sour if allowed to remain standing in piles before canning. I 
was told of the condition in some of the factories which had consid- 
erable sour corn. It was something Hke this : They were sorting 
their corn after it was husked, into two grades, a Xo. i and No. 2. 
The No. I grade w-as run through the cutters, cooked, filled, capped 
and processed promptly, while the No. 2 was carried off to one side 
and the husked ears were piled up in great heaps. This remained 
in this condition until after completing the run on No. i ; then the 
No. 2 was run through the machine and canned. A great many 
*'sours" developed in this No. 2, and it is no wonder, because the 
lactic acid bacteria would develop readily in the center of such piles 
and when lactic acid is formed it cannot be eliminated by any cook- 
ing process. 

A GAS PRODUCING ORGANISM IN CANNED CORN. 

We examined a can of corn which had received about half the 
process usually given corn. Our idea was to isolate all the bacteria 
that usually infest corn, and we expected to find several different 
varieties, but only one species developed, which was an anaerobe. 
This germ produced great quantities of gas and the can swelled up 
until it was nearly ready to burst when we punctured it and made 
plate cultures of the bacteria. While the germ was an anaerobe we 
could get a small growth when culti\ated in the presence of air but 
it grew better when all oxygen was excluded. The gas produced by 
this organism was sulphuretted hydrogen, which we detected by 
the sodium ferri-tartrate test. We also found that this germ pro- 
duced phenol, which probably accounted for the fact that no other 
organisms were present, the phenol having acted as an antiseptic. 
This organism produces spores rapidly in the incubator at 98 de- 
grees Fahr., and while these spores are heat-resisting, they are not 
to be compared with those of the bacteria which produce no gas. 

One peculiarity of this germ has induced us to mention the ex- 
periment in this issue, namely, its production of phenol; and there 
are quite a number of other bacteria which produce the same sub- 
stance, and goods in which they are thriving will respond to the fer- 
ric chloride test for salicylic acid. We do not l)elieve any packers 
ever use salicvlic acid in canned com, Init we have seen some of the

what caused cans of corn to burst. 

Nationai, Caxners' Laboratory, 
Aspinwall, Pa. 

GENTI.EMEN : — We are sending you by express today a num- 
ber of cans of corn, some of the cans being swollen and some bursted 
at the seam. A\'e desire that you analyze the contents of these cans 
and determine the cause of their swelling and bursting. They were 
supposed to have received 250° F'ahr., for the regular length of 
time. 

The point which we are particularly anxious to learn is whether 
the swelling and bursting of these cans is due to imperfect steriliza- 
tion or to a leaky condition of the cans. We have gathered from 
your bacteriological work along these lines that it is possible to de- 
termine from the nature of fhe bacteria present in canned goods 
w-hether they are there because of incomplete sterilization or whether 
they had gained entrance through a leak in the can. 

Kindly investigate this matter thoroughly and let us have your 
report at the earliest possible moment. Thanking you in advance 
and awaiting your reply, we are. 

Yours verv trulv. 



The two cases of swelled and bursted cans of corn were re- 
ceived at the National Canners' Laboratory and report on same is 
here submitted : 

A large per cent of the cans were burst and the contents gone. 
Some of the cans were burst on the side seam, some at the tops and 
bottoms and others had the tops and bottoms completely torn off, 
not where they were soldered, but where they were bent. The pres- 
sure necessary to produce this condition of affairs must have been 
enormous, probably 35 or 40 pounds to the square inch. There 
were also quite a number of cans which were swelled at both ends 
and from general appearance did not leak. A test was made wnth 
pressure on one of these swelled cans as follows : A hole was cut 
in the cap and the putrefied corn was shaken out and a piece of pipe 
was attached to the can and soldered perfectly tight and this pipe 
was connected with a steam autoclav and the pressure was raised 
to 30 pounds without bursting the can. There was no evidence of 



443 CANNING AND PRESERVING OF FOOD PRODUCTS. 

any leak in the can. A microscopical examination of tlie seams 
showed no imperfections. 

In order to determine wliether these cans had spoiled trom bac- 
teria which had not been destroyed in the sterilizing process, or 
by bacteria which had gained entrance through some possible leak, 
it was necessary to isolate and study the nature of the germs pre- 
sent, and then form definite conclusions from the results of the bac- 
teriological work. A number of Petri dishes, about thirty in all, 
were streaked with the juice of the corn from a half dozen swelled 
cans and these were placed in the incubator. A large number of 
tubes containing 2 per cent ghicose agar and 2 per cent glucose 
bouillon were also inoculated at the same time, and these were placed 



Plate 180 
ad burst rrom tbe prea: 



in an anaerobic culture apparatus. The juice from the com was 
obtained from the swelled cans under aseptic conditions in the fol- 
lowing manner : A Bunsen tlame was held so that it would strike 
the tin and a hole was punched through the tin with a sterilized awl 
directly in the flame. In every case the evolution of gas was enor- 
mous and took fire in some cases, which showed the presence of 
hydrogen. Test papers also showed the presence of phosphoretted 
and sulphuretted hydrogen: the odor was abominable. With a 
platinum needle previously sterilized to whiteness in the flame. 
transfers were made of the com juice to the tubes of agar and bouil- 
lon previously mentioned. It often happens that the bacteria which 
produce such large quantities of gas belong to the anaerobic species: 
that is to say, they will not grow in the presence of atmosphere, the 
oxygen in tlic atmosphere being poisonous to them: therefore it is 



necessary to entirely exclude oxygen, either by replacing it with 
another gas, such as hydrogen, or by absorbing it with chemicals, 
such as pyrogallic acid neutralized with sodium hydroxide. 

Anaerobic bacteria, as a rule, are found in the soil and upon 
vegetable and decomposing organic matter. They are generally 
spore-bearing organisms and are twt freely distributed in the air 
and are not likely to gain entrance to a can through a ieak. When- 
ever canned vegetables are spoiled by bacteria which gain entrance 
through leaks in the cans there are two or three varieties, one or 
more of which are always present. In fact, the lactic acid bacteria 
have been found in all leaks so far examined in the laboratory.

An examination was made of the juice from the cans in ques- 
tion, and no Sactic acid or acetic acid bacteria, no moMs, yeasts or 
micrococci could be detected with the microscope, but in all cases 
there were present large numbers of motile bacteria. Each can 
seemed to have a pure culture of these germs, ahhough there were 
two distinct species, in the different cans, one more activeSy motile 
than the other. The Petri dishes which were inoculated with the 
juice were examined from time to time, but in no case was a single 
colony of bacteria obtained. These Petri dishes were incubated 
at 98 degrees Fahrenheit in the presence of free atmosphere. The 
results were far different with the tubes of glucose agar and boui!-

to pieces by the force of the gas generated and the glucose bouillon 
fermented freely. The cultures of the bacteria in all cases were 
pure, although there were two different species. 

DESCRIPTION OF BACTERIA. 

Plate shows young, vegetating rods which are stained by a 
special method to demonstrate the organs of locomotion. The 
rods are thin, three to five microns long and 0.3 to 0.5 of a micron 
wide, curly resembling tetanus. (A micron is equal to .025 of an

inch,) In addition to the ordinary flagella there are scattered 
out the coverglass preparation great twisted bodies called by some 
authors "Giant Whips." These whips are different from similar 
borlies (described by various authors), in that they seem to have 
a small, round cell at the end. This cell is about O.S of a micron 
in diameter. It is not uncommon to find places where a large 
number of these cells are arranged in a mass with the "giant 
whips" extending outward, resembling spirochaetes. 

Plate No. 5 shows the free spores and also spores formed at 
the en<l of the bacilli, which gives them the appearance of drum- 
sticks or screw eyes. The spores are larger in diameter than the 



CORN. 451 

rod forms. They are round, measuring from i to ij4 microns in 
diameter. These spores are very resistant to high temperatures on 
account of their thick walled membranes. 

Plate No. 185 shows a growth of this organism in 2 per cent 
glucose agar. The agar is split in numerous places by the gas 
formed. This germ produces butyric acid, mercaptan and indol, 
and we have given it the name of "Bacillus Butyrjcus Frumenti," 
a name which indicates its origin in corn.

Plate No. i86 shows a young vegetating form of another bacil- 
lus similar in some respects to the species just described, being 
both anaerobic and spore-bearing. From its nature it greatly re- 
sembles Bacillus Butyricus (Prazmowski). It is a beautifully 
flagellated bacillus, with rods of varying length and i micron wide 
and called "Aniylobacter." from the fact that when grown upon 
media containing starch the cells will stain blue with lodin. It is 
more actively motile than the other species described and the spores 
are located generally in the center of the rods, as shown in plate 
No. 8. 

This organism has the power to cause the fermentation of 
cellulose, but we believe that it is different from Bacillus Aniylobac- 
ter used in pure cultures in the ripening of cheese.

Besides butyric acid it excretes some foul substances, such as 
indol and sulphuretted hydrogen. The odor of canned corn in- 
dicating decomposition by this agency is abominable. It took sev- 
eral hours to remove the malodorous gases from the laboratory. 

These two species were the only ones found in the swelled cans, 
which gave no indication of leaking. These species are not contam-

any leaks; they would not be growing alone in pure cultures in 
case they had by chance gained entrance to the can. They are

ganisms present. As stated previously, lactic acid and acetic acid, 
molds, yeasts and micrococci are the species which are freely dis- 
tributed in the atmosphere, and some of these would most certainly 
have been present in case the cans had leaked. There can be no 
other conclusion than that the sterilizing process was insufficient to 
prevent the growth and multiplication of anaerobic bacteria present 
in the corn itself. It might be added that these two species de-
