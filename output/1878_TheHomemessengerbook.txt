PREFACE. 



Of the making of books there is no end, and of the making of 
Cook Books we trust there never will be, as long as each successive 
volume records an advance in gastronomic art and science. Every 
American woman of medium ability edits a receipt book. Our 
library shelves are full of these productions. Miss Leslie, Mrs. 
Hall, Mrs. Cornelius, Miss Beecher, Marion Harland, and scores of 
others, have contributed their mite, or might. Monsieur Blot 
rushed into the arena with the laudable intention of reforming, 
reconstructing and remodeling American taste. The present 
volume is an imambitious compilation of receipts gathered from 
hundreds of private sources, and published during the past ten 
years in the Home Messenger, the organ of the Detroit Home of the 
Friendless, and the Thompson Home for old ladies. They have 
been tried, tested, criticised and reformed, until in a plain and 
practical way we consider them faultless. 

By the exercise of forethought much better meals can be had 
with far greater economj'. Decide as far as possible the night before, 
wdiat are to be your meals for the following day; b}-^ this means you 
can use yeast instead of baking powder, have cold tapioca puddings 
or creams or rice meringues, have your soup stocks on hand, etc. 
Nothing is wiser policy than to face the inevitable in time, for like 
seed time and harvest (only far more frequently), come Breakfast, 
Dinner and Supper. 

No cookery book alone will make a good cook. Judgment in 
baking, boiling, stewing, frying and compounding is only to be 
attained by experience ; but the acquisition of that experience 
may be greatly expedited by such instructions as are to be found 
herein. Here are receipts that will enable any lady to get up for 
her own family, "or ceremonious guests, a delightful breakfast, lunch, 
dinner, tea, tea-company, or large evening entertainment. We 



IV PREFACE. 

have endeavored to make them so explicit that a hidy can follow 
them herself, or stand by her cook, and see that she follows them. 
One word on the subject of instructing cooks: 
" Do you understand how to make muffins, Bridget ? " 
"I do that, mum, I makes illegant muffins; they're just as 
loight, as loight," etc. 

True enough, they are as "loight, as loight," for she poisons 
them with baking powder, and they taste like saw-dust and over- 
effervesced soda water. Therefore stand by her ; see that she puts 
in first, flour ; second, salt ; third, milk and eggs beaten together ; 
fourth, yeast; fifth, butter, and then make sure they s6t in a warm 
place over night. 

In this book will be found some of the most distinguished 
receipts, whose secrecy has been guarded with great care ; a rare 
one for Biscuit Glace, others for Water Ices, Creams, Chicken and 
Lobster Salad, and very many fresh and new receipts for Sweet 
Cakes; at the end of the volume a few bills of fare for the varioua 
seasons, or different styles of entertainment. 

Detroit, December, 1878.

OUR ONE RECOMMENDATION 



In the study of this book and the concoction 
of its various dishes, numerous little appliances, 
such as custard kettles, larding needles, paste 
cutters, etc., are referred to. All are desirable 
for some one particular purpose, but for a won- 
derfully useful article that fills a dozen functions 
at the least, we recommend the Dover Egg 
Beater. It saves time, strength and patience, 
and it accomplishes so much better work than 
unskillful hands can, that we trust all our read- 
ers will possess themselves of one. It not only 
beats eggs but mills chocolate, whips cream, 
stirs a salad dressing, mayonnaise, pudding 
sauce, meringue, froth syllabubs, makes apple 
snow and lemon snow, and last, but not least, 
it makes cold cream and ointments better than 
a French perfumer. We append a cut of the Dover, with prices. 
Clubs can buy them by the dozen, at twenty per cent discount. 

It is made in four sizes : 

1st. Family size, for a tumbler, price 50 cents. 

2d. Family size, light general work, price 50 cents, 

3d. Family size, very large and strong, price $3.00. 

4th. "Extra" famil}'- size (which we prefer), price $1.25.

COFFEE, TEA and CHOCOLATE. 



1 Soyer's Cafe an Lait. 

One cup of best coffee, freshly roasted, but unground, two 
cups of boiling water, one quart of boiling milk. Put the 
coffee in a clean, dry kettle, or tin pail ; fit on a close top, and 
set in a sauce-pan of boiling water. Shake it every few minutes, 
without opening it, until you judge that the coffee grains must 
be heated through. If, on lifting the cover, you find that the 
contents of the inner vessel are very hot and smoking, pour 
over thera the boiling water directly from the tea-kettle. 
Cover the inner vessel closely, and set on the side of the 
range, where it will keep very hot, without boiling, for twenty 
minutes. Then add the boiling milk ; let all stand together 
for five minutes more, and strain through thin muslin into the 
coffee urn. Use loaf sugar for sweetening. 



2 Vienna Coffee. 

With very little extra trouble morning coffee can be greatly 
improved. Beat the white of an egg to a stiff froth, mix with 
an equal quantity of whipped cream, and use in coffee instead 
of cream ; put in cream first, then coffee, and lastly this mix- 
ture. Somebody try it, and let me know if they don't think 
"Vienna coffee " a great improvement on the plain " Yankee." 



2 . COFFEE, TEA AND CHOCOLATE. 

3 Good New England Coffee. 

For a family of six take six large tablespoonfuls of best 
Java coffee, well browned and ground (not too fine), beat 
into it half an egg and one cup of cold water. After it is 
thoroughly beaten, let it stand half an hour, well covered. 
Then put into coffee pot, pour on two and a half quarts of 
boiling water and put on the stove, stir once or twice at first, 
to prevent burning. Let it scald fifteen or twenty minutes. 
If desired to be very nice, beat up eight instead of six table- 
spoonfuls coffee ; put six in the pot to boil twenty minutes, 
and about five minutes before it is done, throw in the rest and 
cover quickly. 



4 Coffee for Two Persons. 

Four rounding teaspoonfuls of coffee tied up in a piece of 
Swiss muslin (leave plenty of room for expansion), jDOur on 
two cups of bubbling, boiling water, cover close and set back 
on the range about ten minutes. Break one egg in a large 
coffee cup, give it a good whip with a Dover egg-beater, divide 
it half in each cup, add the usual quantity of sugar, pour on 
the hot coffee, add warm milk and one spoonful of cream, and 
with the golden foam standing one inch above the rim of the 
cup you will think it too pretty to drink, and when you taste 
it will say you never knew how good coffee was before. 



5 Cream and Milk for Coffee. 

Sweet, rich cream, well beaten to free from lumps, is best 
for coffee, but boiling fresh milk is a good substitute. The 
white of an egg, thoroughly beaten and added (California 
coffee) to thin cream or rich milk, is also very nice. 



COFFEE, TEA AND CHOCOLATE. 3 

O Tea and Coffee for Children. 

Tea and coffee dietary for cliildreu is as bS,d in its effects as 
its use is universal. Dr. Ferguson found that children so 
fed only grew four pounds per annum between the ages of 
thirteen and sixteen ; while those who got milk night and 
morning grew fifteen pounds each year. This needs no com- 
mentary. The deteriorated ]3l^y^Wi^e of tea-and-coffee-fed 
children, as seen in their lessened power to resist disease, is 
notorious among the medical men of factory districts. 



7 Tea. 

Tea is made variously as the taste of people require. Black, 
green, Japan, and English breakfast, all require different 
methods. For green or Japan tea, scald the tea-pot and allow 
from one-half to one teaspoonful for each person, as the strength 
of the herb may indicate. Pour over this one-half a cup of 
boiling water, steep in a hot place (but do not let it boil) ten 
minutes, then turn in water at a keen boil, in proportion one 
quart to every three persons. 



S English Breakfast or Oolong. 

Take two teaspoonfuls for three persons, and proceed as 
above, only letting the tea boil for ten minutes. 

An English gentleman, whose tea was quite famous, put it 
to steep in cold water, as soon as the one o'clock dinner was 
over, and left it steeping until supper time, when it was brought 
to a boil. 

Others put it on to steep when the fire is made for supper, 
and let it stand until the meal is announced, served boiling 
hot. 



4 COFFEE, TEA AND CHOCOLATE. 

9 Iced Tea. 

To each glass of tea add the juice of half a lemon ; fill up 
the glass with pounded ice, and sweeten. 



10 G-erman Chocolate. 

For six persons, two cakes of German sweet chocolate ; when 
grated, put with it the yolks of two eggs, and water enough to 
mix well together. Put it in the chocolate boiler with one- 
half pint of hot water, taking care to stir well. After boiling 
five minutes, add one quart of boiling milk, and then add the 
whites of the two eggs beaten to a stiff froth, stirring all the 
while. It must be sent to the table as soon as possible after 
the whites of the eggs are put in. I put two tablespoonfuls 
of sugar in w^liile boiling. Mrs. C. S. I. 



1 1 Chocolate. 

Four heaping tablespoonfuls grated chocolate, one of sug-ar, 
and wet with one of boiling water ; rub this smooth. Then 
stir into one pint of boiling water ; then add one j)int of hoiling 
milk. Let this boil three minutes. It is greatly improved by 
milling, while boiling, with a Dover egg-beater. If desired 
sweet, add to the boiling milk one heaping tablespoonful of 
sugar. 

A dainty addition is two tablespoonfuls of whipped cream, 
that has been sweetened and flavored with vanilla, laid on 
the top of each cup. 



GENERAL HINTS FOR MAKING S0UP8. 



GENERAL HINTS FOR MAKING SOUPS. 



It is not easy to see why soups are held in so little favor by 
Americans generally, while with almost all other people they 
form an important article of food. 

The French, from the richest to the poorest, have their 
"j90< cm feu,^' which literally would be " pot to the fire," but 
it is the name used to designate the universal soup. The 
directions for this vary. We give one of the most economi- 
cal. Put in a pot, which is kept for this purpose alone, 
four and a half quarts of cold water, and three pounds of 
rump beef, with what remains of poultry or cooked meat 
that may be at hand. Put upon the fire until it boils, and 
then place where it will simmer gently, removing the scum 
as it rises; add carrots, two turnips, two leeks or small onions, 
a head of celery, and three or four cloves. 

The whole story is meat and vegetables simmered slowly 
together, and it may be varied in many ways by using differ- 
ent vegetables. The meat and vegetables are removed and 
the clear soup served, after which the meat and vegetables 
are served plain, or the meat is dressed with tomato or other 
sauce. Sometimes a tough fowl is put into the soup pot and 
cooked until tender, and then put into the oven and browned; 
the broth thus made serves for a variety of soups; with ver- 
micelli, macaroni, rice or barley, it gives soups those names. 
By using a variety of vegetables cut fine it makes vegetable 
soup. Roast an onion until it is thoroughly brown and boil 
in the broth and you have brown soup. 



6 SOUPS. 

A soup may be varied in many ways, sometimes by slicing 
hard boiled eggs into it, after dishing; again a slice of bread, 
fried to a brown crisp in butter, cut in small bits and dropped 
into the soup when it is ready for the table, imparts a savory 
relish. 

1 2 Why Soup is Wholesome. 

The London Food Journal says : Physiologically, soup has 
great value for those who hurry to and from their meals, as 
it allows an interval of comparative rest to the fainting 
stomach before the more substantial beef and mutton is 
attacked, rest before solid food being as important as rest 
after it. Let a hungry and weary merchant rush in medias 
res — plunge boldly into roast beef, and what is the result ? 
The defeat is often as precipitate as was the attack. When 
the body is w^eary the stomach must be identified with it, and 
cannot therefore stand the shock of some ill-masticated, half- 
pound weight of beef. But if a small plateful of light soup 
be gently insinuated into the system, nourishment will soon 
be introduced, and strength will follow to receive more sub- 
stantial material. 

13 Perfect Mock Turtle Soup. 

Endeavor to have the head and the broth ready for the 

soup, the day before it is to be eaten. It will take eight 

hours to prepare it properly.

SOUPS. 7 

Get a calf's head with the skin on (the fresher the better) ; 
take out the brains, wash the head several times in cold 
water, let it soak for about an hour in spring water, then lay- 
it in a stew-pan, and cover it with cold water, and half a gal- 
lon over ; as it becomes warm, a great deal of scum will rise, 
which must 'be immediately removed ; let it boil gently for 
one hour, take it up, and, when almost cold, cut the head 
into pieces about an inch and a half by an inch and a quar- 
ter, and the tongue into mouthfuls, or rather make a side dish 
of the tongue and brains. 

When the head is taken out, put in the stock meat (about 
five pounds of knuckle of veal), and as much beef; add to the 
stock all the trimmings and bones of the head, skim it well, 
and then cover it close and let it boil five hours (reserve a 
couple of quarts of this to make gravy sauces) ; then strain 
it off and let it stand till the next morning ; then take off the 
fat, set a large stewpan on the fire with half a pound of good 
fresh butter, twelve ounces of onions sliced, and four ounces 
of green sage ; chop it a little ; let these fry one hour ; then 
rub in half a pound of flour, and by degrees add your broth 
till it is the thickness of cream ; season it with a quarter of 
an ounce of ground allspice and half an ounce of black pep- 
per ground very fine, salt to your taste, and the rind of one 
lemon peeled very thin ; let it simmer very gently for one 
hour and a half, then strain it through a hair sieve ; do not 
rub your soup to get it 'through the sieve, or it will make it 
grouty ; if it does not run through easily, knock your wooden 
spoon against the side of your sieve ; put it in a clean stew- 
pan with the head, and season it by adding to each gallon of 
soup two tablespoon fuls of Tarragon vinegar and two table- 
spoonfuls of lemon juice; let it simmer gently till the meat is 
tender; this may take from half an hour to an hour; take 
care it is not overdone ; stir it frequently to prevent the meat 



8 SOUPS. 

sticking to the bottom of the stewpan, and when the meat is 
quite tender the soup is ready. 

A head weighing twenty pounds, and ten pounds of stock 
meat, will made ten quarts of excellent soup, besides the two 
quarts of stock you have put by for made dishes. 

06s. — If there is more meat on the head than you wish to 
put in the soup, prepare it for a pie, and, with the addition of 
a calf's foot boiled tender, it will make an excellent ragout 
pie ; season it with zest and a little minced onion, put in half 
a teacupful of stock, cover it with puff paste, and bake it one 
hour ; when the soup comes from table, if there is a deal of 
meat and no soup, put it into a pie-dish, season it a little, and 
add some little stock to it ; then cover it with paste, bake it 
one hour, and you have a good mock turtle pie. 

To season the Soup — To each gallon put four tablespoonfuls 
of lemon-juice, two of mushroom catsup, and one teaspoonful 
of mace, a teaspoonful of curry powder, or a quarter of a 
drachm of cayenne, and the peel of a lemon pared as thin as 
possible, let it simmer for five minutes more, take out the 
lemon peel, add the yolks of four hard boiled eggs, and the 
soup is ready for the tureen. 

While the soup is doing, prepare for each tureen a dozen 
and a half of mock turtle forcemeat balls, and put them into 
the tureen. Brain balls, or cakes, are a very elegant addi- 
tion, and are made by boiling the brains for ten minutes, then 
putting them in cold water and cutting them into pieces about 
as big as a large nutmeg ; take savory or lemon thyme dried 
and finely powdered, nutmeg grated, and pepper and salt, and 
pound them all together ; beat up an egg, dip the brains in 
it, and then roll them in this mixture, and make as much of 
it as possible stick to them ; dip them in the egg again, and 
then in finely-grated and sifted bread crumbs ; fry them in 
hot fat, and send them up as a side dish. 



SOUPS. 9 

A veal sweet-bread, not too much done or it will break, cut 
into pieces the same size as you cut the calf's head, and put 
in the soup, just to get warm before it goes to table, is a 
superb ''bonne bouche;'' and pickled tongue, stewed till very 
tender, and cut into mouthfuls, is a favorite addition. We 
order the meat to be cut into mouthfuls, that it may be eaten 
with a spoon ; the knife and fork have no business in a soup- 
plate. 

N. B. — In helping this soup, the distributer of it should 
serve out the meat, force-meat and gravy, in equal parts ; 
however trifling or needless this remark may appear, the 
writer has often suffered from the want of such- a hint being 
given to the soup-server, who has sometimes sent a plate of 
mere gravy without meat, at others, of meat without gravy, 
and sometimes scarcely anything but force-meat balls. 

Obs. — This is a delicious soup, within the reach of those 
who "eat to live;" but if it had been composed expressly for 
those who only " live to eat," I do not know how it could 
have been made more agreeable ; as it is, the lover of good 
eating will " wish his throat a mile long, and every inch of 
it a palate." 



14 Browning for Soups. 

Many of the nicest soups owe their attractive appearance 
to burnt sugar, which is prepared as follows : Put three 
tablespoonfuls of brown sugar and an ounce of butter in a 
small frying pan or iron skillet and set over the fire ; stir con- 
tinually until it is of a bright brown color and sends forth a 
burning smell, add half a pint of water, boil and skim, and 
when cold, bottle for use. Add to soups at discretion. 



10 SOUPS. 

1 5 Suinmer or Winter Corn Soup. 

Boil a leg of mutton or shank of beef in six quarts of 
water for four hours. After the meat and fat have been 
removed (it is better to stand over one day to cool, so that the 
grease may all be taken oft"), add a quart or more of sweet 
corn nicely cut from the cob, and boil twenty or thirty min- 
utes. In cutting the corn (with a sharp knife) take off only 
the point of the kernels, and scrape the milk and pulp, thus 
avoiding the hull or skin, Avhich is indigestible and unpalat- 
able. Just before serving, add to the soup a coffee-cup of 
cream, with two tablespoonfuls of flour stirred smoothly in 
and boil for a minute. This can be made in winter by using 
the Yarmouth canned corn or the dried corn soaked over 
night, and boiled till tender. 



16 Corn Soup. 

Cut the grains from twelve ears of sweet corn and scrape 
the milk, add one quart of water. Let it boil until quite 
done — thirty to forty minutes — then add two quarts of new 
milk, and when it boils stir in one-quarter pound of butter 
rubbed into two tablespoonfuls of flour, pepper and salt. 
Beat the yolks of two eggs in the tureen and pour the soup 
in boiling, stirring all the time. 



1 T Parker House Tomato Soup. 

For one gallon of soup take three quarts of good beef 
stock (a shank of beef will make six quarts) ; one medium 
sized carrot, one turnij:), one beet and two small onions ; peel 
and cut them in pieces ; add to this three quarts of red toma- 
toes ; boil all for one hour and strain through a colander. 



SOUPS. 11 

Put five ounces of butter in a pan, heat it until it becomes a 
light brown ; take it off the fire and add three tablespooufuls 
of flour while hot ; mix w^ell and pour a pint or more of the 
soup into the frying pan, then return all to the soup kettle : 
season with salt, pepper and a dessert spoonful of sugar. Set 
it over the fire and stir till it boils ; boil and skim five min- 
utes. For Avinter soup of this kind strain the soup before 
adding the tomatoes, and use in place of the raw tomatoes 
two quart cans of sealed tomatoes. 



18 Very Eich Beef Soup. 

Rub salt into four pounds of soup meat (to extract the 
juice), and add four quarts cold water ; as it boils away, 
add water boiling hot; skim well and boil slowly. Then add 
one onion, one turnip, one carrot, sliced quite thin, two or 
three stalks of celery, some parsley, a blade of mace, four 
whole cloves, salt and pepper, a tomato, if in season, a table- 
spoon of caramel or burnt sugar. Boil slowly and gently, 
keeping it covered until the vegetables are tender, then strain , 
and it is ready for use. 



19 Turkey Soup. 

Place the rack of a cold turkey and what remains of dress- 
ing or gravy in a pot, and cover with cold water. Simmer 
gently three or four hours, and let it stand until the next day. 
Take off what fat may have risen, and take out with a skim- 
mer all the bits of bones. Put the soup on to heat till boiling, 
then thicken slightly with flour wet up in water, and season 
to the taste. Pick off* all the turkey from the bones, put them 
in the soup, boil up and serve. 



12 SOUPS. 

30 Sorrel Soup (Soup a la Bonne Pemme). 

This is a most wholesome soup, which would be popular in 
America if it were better known. It is much used in France, 
Sorrel can be obtained in season, at all the French markets in 
America. 

For four quarts of soup, put into a saucepan a piece of butter 
the size of an egg, two or three sprigs of parsley, two or three 
leaves of lettuce, one onion and a pint of sorrel (all finely 
chopped), a little nutmeg, pepper and salt. Cover, and let 
them cook or sweat ten minutes, then add two tablespoonfuls 
of flour ; mix well, and gradually add three quarts of boiling 
water (stock would be better). Make a liaison, i. e., beat the 
yolks of four eggs (one egg to a quart of soup), and mix with 
them a cupful of cream, or rich milk; add a little chevril 
(if you have it) to the soup; let it boil ten minutes; then stir 
in the eggs or liaison, when the soup is quite ready. 

31 Calf s Head Soup. 

Take the head, pluck and feet. Put them into a pot with 
cold water. Be careful to skim well when it boils. Chop a 
dozen small onions and let them all boil together until the 
meat cleaves from the bones. Then strain it. After putting 
the liquor into the pot again, add thyme, cloves, salt, pepper 
and cayenne to your taste. Cut all the meat from the head 
and feet, half the liver and lights, the whole of the heart and 
tongue ; put all into the pot and boil about three-quarters of an 
hour. Before it is done take half a pound of butter with as 
much flour as will make into balls ; stir until dissolved. Then 
add two tablespoonfuls of tarragon vinegar, four hard boiled 
eggs cut in slices, and a lemon to improve the flavor. This 
will make two gallons, and may be kept several weeks, to be 
used as occasion requires. 



SOUPS. 13 

23 Tomato Soup. 

One quart of water, eight good sized ripe tomatoes cut up ; 
boil twenty miuutes and add one half teaspoonful of soda ; 
then boil and add one pint or more of milk, and season as you 
do oysters. We have three friends who think this soup is 
delicious and six who pronounce it abominable. 

23 Mock Turtle Soup. 

One quart of black beans soaked over night, boiled until 
soft and mashed through a colander; have ready two quarts 
of soup made of beef bones, add the beans, and boil about an 
hour ; have in the tureen two hard boiled eggs cut up, and 
slices of lemon, half teaspoonful brown sugar, a pinch of 
powdered cloves, cinnamon, black pepper and salt ; a table- 
spoonful of Tarragon vinegar and six blades of mace, and 
a half dozen force-meat balls. 

24 Blaok Bean Soup. 

One quart of black beans, soaked over night in four quarts 
of water, one pound of beef, half pound of salt pork. Grate 
one large or two srflall carrots, and slice one large onion, and 
add to the beans and the water in which they were soaked. Boil 
all together three or four hours, then strain through a colan- 
der. When in the tureen add one tablespoonful of mushroom 
sauce, one sliced lemon and one sliced or chopped boiled egg. 

25 Pea Soup, No. 1. 

Soak one quart of peas (split, if you can get them) overnight ; 
next morning early put them over the fire with one pound of 
corned beef or pork (beef is the best to my taste, however), 
and let them boil hard for three hours. Then add a chopped 



14 SOUPS. 

carrot and turnip, and an onion if liked, a teaspoonful of celery 
seed or a handful of celery tops, and boil another hour or 
more ; then strain through a sieve, season with pepper, and cut 
up two thin slices of toasted bread in the shape of small dice ; 
put in the tureen, turn on your soup and serve. A cup of 
milk boiled in it for twenty minutes is an improvement. Small 
white beans can be substituted for peas and made in the same 
manner. 

26 Pea Soup, No. 2. 

One quart of soaked split peas, two pounds of salt pork, five 
quarts of water. Boil five hours, and strain through a sieve 
while hot. 

27 Crotons. 

These are small pieces of bread, fried crisp and brown, to be 
used in soup. 

28 Oyster Soup.. 

For four cans of oysters have twelve crackers rolled fine, 
two quarts of boiling water, one pint of good rich milk. Let 
the milk and water come to a boil, add the crackers, salt and 
pepper, boil one minute briskly ; pour in the oysters and let all 
come to a scald ; add about a quarter of a pound of butter as 
they are poured into a tureen. 

29 Oyster Soup, No. 2. 

To one quart of oysters add one quart of water ; pour the 
water on the oysters and stir them ; take them out one at a 
time, so that no small particle of shell may adhere to them ; 
strain the liquor through a sieve and put it in a stew-pan over 



SOUPS, 15 

the fire, with two or three blades of mace, and season with red 
pepper and salt to taste ; when this boils put in your oysters, 
add a teaspoonful of flour rubbed to a paste with one ounce of 
butter; let them scald again, then add one-half pint of cream 
and serve hot. 



'SO Oyster Soup, No. 3. 

It is one of the finest soups we have ever tasted. 

To one quart of oysters add a half pint of water. Put this 
on the fire and as soon as it reaches the boiling point (not to 
boil), strain the liquid through the colander. Put into a sep- 
arate saucepan a piece of butter the size of an egg, and to this 
add, when it bubbles (do not let it scorch), a tablespoonful of 
sifted flour ; let this cook a few minutes, stirring well ; then 
add half a pint of sweet milk and then the oysters, seasoning 
with salt and a little cayenne pepper. Do not let the soup 
boil, but keep it quite hot for a moment or two after adding 
the oysters. Have both soup and oysters cooking so equally 
that neither waits for the other. 

31 Clam Soup. 

Put thirty clams in a pot and four quarts of water. Let 
them boil two hours and then take them out and chop fine ; 
return to the pot and add a little mace and a few pepper corns. 
Boil one hour longer. Rub smoothly together a small piece 
of butter, with two tablespoonfuls of flour, and stir this with a 
pint of boiling milk. When the clam soup has boiled three 
hours pour it into a tureen and stir in the thickened milk. 

Canned clams make a nice soup after the above receipt.

32 To Stew Oysters. 

Put the oysters with the broth to boil, and when they begin 
to curl, skim them out of the kettle into a pan of cold water ; 
let them lie in the water until the broth has been skimmed 
and seasoned Avith butter, salt and pepper, add mace if you 
like ; then drain off the water and return the oysters to the 
broth. When they begin to boil up again they are ready to 
serve, and will be found to be more plump and hard by the 
process. 

33 Crriddled Oysters. 

Heat a griddle very hot, butter it and lay large oysters all 
over it ; when brown on one side, turn as you do griddle cakes. 
They should be washed first from the liquor, and this must be 
boiled and skimmed, and turned over the oysters when served, 
first seasoning it with butter, salt and pepper ; serve on bread 
or cracker toast. 

34 Panned Oysters. 

Take the oysters from their liquor, and put them into a 
saucepan or spider that is hot. Let them cook quickly, 
season with salt and pepper, and a little butter, and lay upon 
toast. A little juice will exude from the oysters while cook- 
ing, which will keep them from getting too dry, and they will 
prove very palatable to all who will try it. 



OYSTERS. 17 

35 Panned Oysters. 

One quart of oysters, rounds of tliin toast delicately browned, 
butter, pepper and salt. Have ready several pans of block 
tin, the ordinary " patty pan " will do if you cannot get any- 
thing better. Cut stale bread in thin slices of a size that will 
just fit in the bottom of your pans, toast these quickly to a 
light brown, and lay witliin your tins. Wet with a great 
spoonful of oyster liquor, then with a silver fork arrange upon 
the toast as many oysters as each patty will hold without 
heaping them up. Dust with pepper and salt, put a bit of 
butter on top, and set the pans, when they are full, upon the 
floor of a quick oven. Cover with an inverted baking pan 
to keep in steam and flavor, and cook until the oysters " ruflie." 
Eight minutes in a brisk oven should be enough ; send very 
hot to the table in the tins in which they were roasted. Next 
to roa-sting in the shell this mode of cooking oysters best pre- 
serves the native flavor of the bivalves. 



36 How to Broil Oysters, 

Now let me tell you how we broil oysters here. Given a 
double gridiron that folds together, and a sufficient number 
of the bivalves in puris naturalibus — to roll them in anything 
is to spoil them ; grease the bars of the gridiron, which pre- 
vents their sticking ; then dip each individual — as Audubon 
always said in reference to birds — into melted butter ; place 
them on the utensil. A brisk fire of charcoal is of course 
necessary, over which they are to be broiled. Meantime they 
should be constantly basted with butter. When done, serve 
on very hot toast and dishes, and you have a dish that Brillat- 
Savarin, with all his gastronomic ideas, never thought of, and 
which would have driven him mad with envy.

18 OYSTEllS. 

37 Pried Oysters. 

Select the largest, drain theni on a cloth or hair sieve, dip 
them in rolled cracker crumbs that have been seasoned with 
pepper and salt ; liy in equal parts of butter and lard until 
they are browned. Grated bread cruml)s are even more 
delicate than cracker crumbs. 



38 To Pry Oysters with Batter. 

Take fine large oysters, beat as many eggs with cream (say 
two eggs to a cup of cream) as will moisten all the oysters 
required ; dip the oyster thoroughly into this mixture and 
then cover well with cracker crumbs which have been seasoned 
with salt, pepper and a little mace, if desired. Put into your 
frying pan or spider equal quantities of butter and lard, and 
when hot fry the prepared oysters to a delicate brown tint 
and serve hot. If preferred, add three tablespoonfuls of flour 
to the eggs and cream, and omit the cracker crumbs. 



39 Oysters Broiled on the Shell 

The oysters should be of the largest size. Clean the shells 
with a stiff brush, then open, and save the juice; turn boiling 
water over the oysters for only a minute or two ; drain it off, 
and lay the oysters on one-half of the shell, putting in on a 
well-heated gridiron over a very hot fire. Boil the liquor 
that came from the oysters when opened, add it to the shells 
with a sprinkle of salt, pepper, and a bit of butter, serve 
hot on the shells, laid on large platters. 



OYSTERS. 19 

40 Unsurpassed Fricasseed Oysters, 

For one can of oysters use one pint of thin cream ; clean 
all the liquor from the oysters and put them over steam until 
hot ; at the same time thicken the cream with flour and season 
with salt, pepper and a small pinch of mace, and the same of 
cinnamon and a very little butter ; cook this well, and when 
done thoroughly, add to it the liquor of the oysters which has 
been scalded and well skimmed until clear ; then add the 
oysters, letting them remain just long enough to get plump 
(if left too long they grow tough). Have ready some toast 
on a platter and pour the whole over it, or have leaves and 
triangles of rich paste around the dish and partially moistened 
by the fricassee. Your platter must be very hot, as fricasseed 
oysters chill like a new-born baby. 



41 Fricasseed Oysters. 

Drain the liquor from a quart of oysters, strain half a pint 
and put in a porcelain kettle and when it boils put in the 
oysters. Have a tablesjjoonful of flour rubbed well into two 
tablespoonfuls of butter. When the oysters begin to swell, 
stir in the butter and flour, cook until the oysters are white 
and plump ; then add a gill of cream, and pepper and salt. 



43 Oyster Pie. 

Two cans of oysters, or three pints of solid oysters, one 
quart of cream, one dozen rolled crackers, pepper, salt, etc. 
Stir all together and pour into a dish lined with thick puff* 
paste, cover with another paste and bake three-quarters of an 
hour. This is a delicious mode of cooking oysters. 



20 OYSTERS. 

43 Oyster Patties. 

Put the oysters in a saucepan with enough of the liquor to 
cover them ; let them come to a boil, skim well, add two 
tablespoonfuls of butter for one quart of oysters, season with 
pepper and a little salt. Two or three spoonfuls of cream will 
add to the richness. Have ready small tins lined with pufF- 
paste ; put three or four oysters in each, according to the size 
of the patty ; cover with paste and bake in a quick oven 
twenty minutes ; when done wash over the top with beaten 
egg and set in the oven for two minutes to glaze. 

44 Oyster Patties. 

Make a rich puff paste, cut in small squares, place a layer 
of oysters which have been dried on a napkin on the paste, 
dust a little salt, powdered mace and cayenne pepper over 
them, covering with another piece of paste ; wet the edges of 
the paste with cold water, using a paste brush, and j^iuch 
tightly together ; bake in a rather quick oven. It should be 
a light color. 

45 Scalloped Oysters. 

Have plenty of fine crushed cracker crumbs — either soda 
or butter crackers ; put a layer in the bottom of a buttered 
pudding dish ; wet slightly with oyster liquor and milk, 
mixed ; next a layer of oysters ; season with salt and pepper 
and small bits of butter; then more crumbs and oysters, alter- 
nately, until the dish is full. Let the top layer be of crumbs. 
Beat an egg and mix it with a little milk to pour over the 
top; place little lumps of butter all over the top, cover th6 
dish and bake half an hour; remove the cover a few minutes 
before taking from the oven to let it brown. 



OYSTERS. 21 

40 Scalloped Oysters. 

One quart of oysters, one heaping cup of bread or cracker 
crumbs, season with pepper and salt, butter a baking-dish, spread 
a layer of crumbs on the bottom, with bits of butter, cover 
thickly with oy^ers, moisten with a little of the liquor ; repeat 
the same until the dish is full, finishing with the layer of 
crumbs and bits of butter. To some tastes a little mace is 
considered an improvement. 

47 Chicken and Oyster Croquettes. 

Take equal quantities of chicken and oysters, chopped fine, 
with a cup of sifted bread crumbs and a piece of butter ; season 
with salt and pepper, and, if liked, a little mace. Moisten with 
one or two well beaten eggs. Form into long, slender rolls, 
and fry in lard to a light brown ; serve on a napkin, and 
garnish with celery tops or parsley, and slices of lemon. 

48 Pickled Oysters. 

Strain the liquor from the oysters ; boil and skim until 
clear ; drop in the oysters and let them come to a boil ; skim 
them out and put them in a jar. Take about half the liquor 
remaining, add vinegar until it tastes sharp, a few whole 
cloves and allspice ; boil and pour over the oysters hot ; cover 
them, and let them stand two or three days before using. If 
you wish to use them any sooner take a little more vinegar. 

49 Pickled Oysters, No. 2. 

Take the oysters from the liquor, boil and skim it. Rinse 
the oysters if there are any bits of shell attached to them ; put 
them in the liquor while boiling ; boil them one minute, then 
take them out of it, and to the liquor put a few pepper corns 



22 OYSTERS. 

and a blade or two of mace, and a little salt, and the same 
quantity of vinegar as oyster juice. Let the whole boil fifteen 
minutes, then turn it on to the oysters. If you wish to keep 
the oysters a couple of weeks, bottle and cork them tight as 
soon as cold. 

50 Lobster Croquettes- 

Chop the meat of a well-boiled lobster fine, add pepper, 
salt, and mace, if liked ; mix with this one-fourth as much 
bread crumbs as you have meat ; with two tablespoonfuls of 
melted butter and yolks of two eggs, form into balls, roll these 
in beaten egg, then in cracker crumbs and fry in hot lard. 

51 Clam Fritters. 

Twelve clams, minced fine, one pint milk, three eggs ; add 
the liquor from the clams to the milk ; beat up the eggs and 
put to this, with salt and pepj^er, and flour enough for a thin 
batter ; lastly add the chopped clams. Fry in hot lard, try- 
ing a little first to see if fat and batter are right. A table- 
spoonful makes a fritter of moderate size. Fry quickly and 
serve hot. 

Raw Oysters. 

Should be served at a party or small entertainment on a 
handsome block of ice, that has been hollowed out on the top. 
Set the ice on a platter and garnish the edges with quarters 
of lemons. Be careful that in its melting the water does not 
overflow. For a second course at dinners or lunches lay three 
or four oysters on an individual oyster dish, garnished with 
lemon ; lay a sprig of the yellow heart of celery across. Have 
pepper, salt and vinegar at hand. 



FISH AND FROGS. 23 



FISH AND FROGS. 



5a Boiled Fish. 

Rub the fish with a fresh lemon, inside and out. To four 
quarts of boiling water add half a teacupful of salt and half 
a teacupful of vinegar ; boil t^ently, or scald, as the size of the 
fish may require, allowing from six to ten minutes for each 
pound of fish. Serve with egg sauce or drawn butter. 

53 Boiled Fish with Vegetable Flavor. 

Mince a carrot, an onion, and a small piece of celery ; fry 
them in a stewpan with a little butter ; add some parsley, 
some pepper-corn, and three or four cloves. Now pour ou two 
quarts of hot Avater and a pint of vinegar ; let it boil a quarter 
of an hour, skim it, salt it, and use for boiling the fish. E-ub 
the fish with lemon juice and salt, put it in a kettle and cover 
with the above liquor. Let it only simmer — not boil hard — 
until thoroughly done. 

54 To Broil a White Fish. 

Lay the fish wide open upon a double gridiron, and broil it 
as you w^ould a steak. 

55 Fish Chowder. 

Quarter pound of pork, cut in pieces ; put in the bottom of 
the pot and fry out. Put slices of potatoes on this, then layer 
of fish, cut up, two onions, sliced, and layer of soda crackers ; 
repeat these layers. Then pour boiling water over till well 
covered. Stew twenty-five minutes. 



24 FISH AND FROGS. 

56 Turbot, No. 1. 

Take a fioe large white fisli, steam until tender; takeout 
the bones and sprinkle with pepper and salt. For the dressing 
heat one quart of milk and thicken with one-quarter pound of 
flour. When cool add two eggs and one-quarter pound of 
butter; Put in the baking dish a layer of fish, then a layer 
of sauce, until full. Season with onions, parsley and thyme. 
Cover the top with bread crumbs and bake three-quarters of 
an hour. 

57 Turbot, Uo. 2. 

Five pounds of white fish, boil and cool. For dressing take 
one quart of milk, one-quarter pound of flour, wet with a little 
milk, oncrquarter pound of butter, two eggs, two small onions, 
one-half bunch of thyme, one-half bunch of green parsley, 
pepper and salt. Boil together until- it thickens. Put in the 
baking dish a layer of fish, then a layer of dressing, a layer of 
bread crumbs. Grate cheese over the top, and bake half an 
hour. 

58 Turbot, No. 3, or Cul-de-Sac or Pish Chowder. 

Boil three pounds of fresh cod, rock pike or other fresh white 
fish ; pick it fine and free from bones, season with pepper, salt, 
the grated rind and juice of a lemon, a teaspoonful of anchovy 
sauce ; take one quart of milk, slice in it two small onions and 
boil until they are soft ; strain it and thicken with butter and 
flour to the consistency of thick drawn butter. Put a layer 
of fish and dressing alternately, shape into a round or oval form, 
cover with grated bread crumbs, and bake nicely. It can be 
served upon the same platter in which it is browned, by 
placing muffin-rings under it in a pan of water while baking. 



FISH AND FR0G8. 25 



59 Pickled Pish. 



Skin the fish and pack in a deep dish, cover with olive oil 
or butter ; spice with vinegar, seasoned with pepper, cloves, 
cinnamon, allspice and salt ; scald these and pour over the fish, 
cover closely and- bake until done. 

60 Picked Cod-fish (Delicious). 

Pick, very fine indeed, of the thick part of the cod-fish one 
pound, put it into the spider, pour over sufficient boiling water 
to cover it well, then stir it well for a minute, pour off* all this 
water and if the fish is still too salty repeat the process. Get 
ready a cup and a half of sweet (fresh) milk. Take from this 
amount of milk four tablespoonfuls and mix into it two table- 
spoons of sifted flour and stir till it becomes a smooth bat- 
ter. Pour on to the fish the fresh milk and set on the stove. 
Add to it two ounces of butter. Allow it to cook till the but- 
ter melts, then stir in the prepared batter very slowly and let 
all boil ten minutes, stirring all the time. If too thick add a 
little milk ; if too thin, add a little flour. After dishing, 
'sprinkle a little pepper over it. Cream can be used without 
the flour. 

61 Cod-fish for Priday Dinner. 

One quart picked cod-fish, one pint bread crumbs, one-half 
pint cream, four ounces butter, one teaspoon pepper ; wash the 
fish thoroughly and soak over night in cold water. When 
ready to use pick it fine ; put it in a baking-dish, in layers, with 
the crumbs and pepper (adding a little mustard if you like) ; 
over the top layer, which must be crumbs, spread the softened 
butter ; pour the cream over the whole and bake half an hour. 
Milk ma}"" be used instead of cream. 



26 FISH AND FROGS. 

i^2 Progs. 

Scald them in salted boiling water, rub them with lemon 
juice and boil for three minutes ; wipe them ; dip them first 
in cracker dust, then in eggs (half a cupful of milk mixed in 
two eggs and seasoned with pepper and salt), then again in 
cracker crumbs. When they are well covered with crumbs, 
clean off the bone at the end with a dry cloth. Put a table- 
spoonful of lard and a tablespoonful of butter in a spider, over 
a bright fire, and when hot enough put in the frogs and fry. 



SAVORY SAUCES. 27 



SAA^ORY SAUCES. 



03 Drawn Butter. 

Take one-quarter of a pound of fresh butter, cut it up and 
mix with two teaspoonfuls of flour : when thorouglily mixed, 
put it into a saucepan and add to it four tablespoonfuls of 
cold water ; set your stewpan over a slow fire and stir it con- 
tinually one way ; when the butter is entirely melted and 
begins to simmer, then let it rest until it boils up. This sauce 
may be greatly varied and called by a dozen names. 1st. By 
the addition of two tablespoonfuls of nasturtions, or pickled 
cucumber, or cauliflowers, these latter cut fine, or by two 
tablespoonfuls of capers. 2d. For Fish, anchovy paste or 
anchovy sauce may be added as desired, from one teaspoon- 
ful to one tablespoonful, or the inside of a lemon chopped 
fine, being careful to remove the seeds. 

04 Egg Sauce. 

Cut up three hard-boiled eggs in small dice, salt, pepper, 
minced onions (one teaspoon ful), parsley and thyme ; add all 
these to the drawn butter recipe. It is very nice for boiled 
chickens, fish or leg of mutton. 

05 Oyster Sauce. 

Scald one pint of large fresh oysters just enough to plump 
them, adding one tablespoonful of pepper, vinegar, a littli' 
black pepper and salt ; pour this into a recipe of well made 
drawn butter (as above) at boiling point ; stir thoroughly, and 
serve. 



28 SAVORY SAUCES. 

66 Celery Sauce. 

Cut enough celery into pieces half an inch long to fill a 
pint bowl, and stew in a small quantity of water (say a cup- 
ful) till tender ; add one teaspoonful of pepper vinegar, a 
little salt and pepper ; pour in one teacup of cream or milk, 
and add a teacup of very thick drawn butter. 



(M! Tomato Sauce. 

Scald and peel six large, ripe tomatoes ; cut them up and 
stew slowly ; cream together one tablespoonful of butter, one 
tablespoonful of sugar, one tablespoonful of flour ; when the 
tomatoes are thoroughly done and reduced to a fine pulp, add 
pepper and salt ; stir the butter, sugar and flour in ; let boil 
up, and serve. In winter this sauce may be made from nice 
canned tomatoes. 



68 Pepper Vinegar. 

Fill a quart bottle or jar with small peppers, either green 
or ripe ; put in two tablespoonfuls of sugar and fill with good 
cider vinegar. Invaluable in seasoning sauces, and good to 
eat with fish or meat. 



69 Mint Sauce. 

Of fresh garden mint take enough to make half a tea- 
cupful when chopped fine, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, half a 
teacup of cold vinegar ; let stand from one to three hours; 
when your lamb is ready to serve, add half a teacup of boil- 
ing water and let scald. 



SAVORY SAUCES. 29 

70 Mrs. Allen's Tomato Sauce. 

Odg peck of green tomatoes sliced ; cover with water ; one 
pint of salt ; stand twenty-four hours, then rinse with cold 
water; chop fine. with twelve large peppers, six onious, one 
head of cabbage, two cauliflowers ; put all together in a ves- 
sel ; cover with vinegar, scald and drain. Take two quarts 
of vinegar, one pint of molasses, one teaspoonful of cloves, 
one tablespoonful of allspice, two ounces ginger, one-half 
pound of mustard seed, cover with cold vinegar. 

71 Chili Sauce. 

Twelve ripe tomatoes, four ripe peppers, two onious, two 
tablespoon fu Is of salt, two of sugar, three teacups of vinegar, 
a little cinnamon, chopped tomatoes, peppers and onions, very 
fine ; boil one hour. 

72 White Sauce for Fowls. 

Take the neck, gizzard and liver of fowls, with a piece of 
veal or calf's foot; boil in one quart of water with a few 
whole peppers, and salt, till reduced to one pint ; then thicken 
with two tablespooufuls of flour mixed with two tablespooii- 
fuls of butter ; boil five or six minutes ; have ready the yolks 
of two eggs beaten with one teacup of cream from the morn- 
ing's milk ; pour into the saucepan and shake a moment until 
done. 

73 Mushroom Sauce. 

Wash and pick one pint of fresh mushrooms (or one can 
of French mushrooms), put in a saucepan with a little 



oO SAVORY SAUCES. 

salt, nutmeg (three grates), one blade of mace, one pint of 
very sweet cream, a lump of butter (size of a pullet's egg) 
rubbed in one tablespoon of flour ; boil up, stir until cooked, 
and serve with chickens. 

74 Horse-radish Sauce. 

One teacupful of grated horse-radish, one tablespoonful of 
ground mustard, one tablespoonful of sugar, four tablespoon- 
fuls vinegar and one of olive oil, pepper and salt. 

75 Mint Vinegar. 

Take a glass can and put loosely into it enough nice, clean 
mint leaves to fill it ; then pour over enough good vinegar to 
fill the bottle full. Cork tight and let stand for three weeks ; 
then pour off into another bottle and keep to flavor mint 
sauce, etc. 

76 Pepper Vinegar— Tarragon Vinegar. 

Fill a quart bottle with small peppers, either green or ripe ; 
put in two tablespoonfuls sugar and fill with good cider vine- 
gar. 

Tarragon vinegar can be made after the above recipe, only 
substituting three ounces of tarragon leaves (to be bought of 
first-class grocers) for the peppers. The article recommended 
is Vinagre Estragone, prepared in Bordeaux. 

77 Maitre d'Hotel Butter. 

Mix butter the size of an egg, the juice of half a lemon, 
and two or three sprigs of parsley, chopped very fine ; pepper 
and salt all together. Spread this over any broiled meat or 
fish when hot ; then put the dish into the oven a few moments 
to allow the butter to penetrate the meat. 



SAVORY SAUCES. 31 

78 Dutch Sauce— For Pish (Sauce Hollandaise). 

One half teaspoonfiil of flour, two ounces of butter, four 
tablespoonfuls of vinegar — tarragon vinegar is best — yolk of 
two eggs, juice of half a lemon, salt to the taste. Put all the 
ingredients except the lemon juice into a stewpan. Set it 
over the fire and stir constantly until it heats (but not boils). 
Add the lemon. 

79 Sauce Tartare (A Cold Sauce). 

We take from Mrs. Henderson this recipe: To a scant 
half pint of Mayonnaise sauce, made with the mustard added, 
mix in two tablespoonfuls of capers, one small shallot (a 
quarter of an onion is a poor substitute), two gherkins or two 
ounces of cucumber, and one tablespoonful of parsley, all 
chopped very fine. This sauce will keep a long time bottled 
and corked, and is delicious for fried fish, fried oysters, boiled 
cod-fish, cold tongue, or salads. 

80 Mushroom Sauce. 

Take a ladleful of stock, free from grease, from the stock- 
pot, add to it part of the juice from the can of mushrooms ; 
thicken it with a little flour and butler mixed, add pepper, 
salt, and a few drops of lemon juice; now add the mushrooms. 
Let them simmer a few minutes. Pour the sauce over the 
fillet of beef and serve. 

8 1 Pish Sauce (Grand Hotel, Paris), Sauce Hollandaise. 

Place in a saucepan the yolks of six eggs, and a little pep- 
per ; put them in a vessel of hot water, or over a very slow 
fire. Stir quickly, adding, little by little, one pound of the 



32 SAVORY SAUCES. 

freshest butter to every six eggs. When the butter is melted 
and mixed, pass through a sieve ; add the juice of a lemon, or 
a little vinegar. To keep it hot, return the saucepan to the 
vessel of hot water. 



82 Bread Sauce. 

Two slices of stale bread without any crust; put them 
into a saucepan with two small onions, eight or ten pepper 
corns, and cold water enough to cover. 



BEEF. 33 



BEEF. 

83 Eoast Beef. 

Wash the joint and wipe it dry ; then place it on a pan, 
with the fat and skin side up ; put into a hot oven, and when 
the heat has started enough of the oil of the fat to baste with, 
open the oven, and drawing the pan toward you, take up a 
spoonful of the grease and pour over the meat for a few times, 
closing the door immediately ; this should be repeated four or 
five times during the process of roasting. When nearly done 
sprinkle with salt, and baste. Have ready a warm platter, 
and when the meat is dished drain off the grease, carefully 
keeping back the rich, brown juice which has exuded from 
the meat. 

This remaining gravy leave in the pan, placing it on the 
stove and adding about a gill of water, or soup stock, let it 
come to a boil and then pour it over the meat. If a made 
gravy is preferred, more water should be added and a little 
flour. Salt hardens and toughens meat, therefore in beef and 
mutton it should not be put on till it is cooked. It is also 
necessary to have the oven hot in order that the heat may 
quickly sear the surface, which Avill prevent the juice from 
escaping. It is obvious, if water is put in the pan, this quick 
searing cannot be effected ; water cannot be raised above a 
certain temperature (its boiling point), while fat is susceptible 
of a much greater degree of heat, and, therefore, as a basting 
agent is preferable. Beef roasted before a fire has a flavor 
inexpressibly finer than that done in an oven. 

[We recommend Yorkshire pudding to be cooked and eaten 
with roast beef.-^Eo.]

34 BEEF. 

84 Fillet of Beef. 

The fillet is the under side of the loin of beef, that portion 
from which porter-house steaks are cut. This under side or 
fillet is covered with skin or fat. Loosen the rib bones and 
leave a little of the fat on the opposite side, trim the thick 
sinewy skin carefully off. This operation is very simple, yet 
it requires great precision . Lard the beef with a fine larding 
needle and nice salt pork. After it is trimmed and larded, 
put it into a small baking pan, on the bottom of Avhich is 
some chopped pieces of pork and beef suet, sprinkle some salt 
and pepper over it, and put a large ladleful of hot stock into 
the bottom of the pan, or it may be simply basted with boil- 
ing water. Three-quarters of an hour before dinner put it 
into the oven. Baste it often, supplying a little hot stock, if 
necessary. 

85 Beef a la Mode, 

Take the bone out of a small round of beef, cut some salt 
pork in strips, about the size of your two 'fingers, and the 
thickness of the beef; dip them in vinegar and roll them in 
the following seasoning : One grated nutmeg, one tablespoon- 
ful black pepper, one of ground cloves, one of allspice and 
two of salt; add parsley, thyme, sweet marjoram and summer 
savory ; then cut openings about four inches apart all through 
the beef and insert them. Make a rich stufiing with bread 
crumb, etc., lay it over the top. Put the whole into a covered 
pan, pour over it half a pint of vinegar and let it stand in the 
oven for five hours. The addition of vegetables, one large 
onion, four carrots and two turnips, chopped fine, is a great 
improvement. Half an hour before serving skim off' the fat, 
take up the round and vegetables, and add a little browned 
flour to the gravy; this is as delightful a dish as a turkey 
when it is no longer in season. 



BEEF. 35 

86 A la Mode Beef. 

Take a round of beef, from tliree to four inches thick, and 
pound well, make as many incisions in the meat as possible, 
mix thoroughly blades of onions with ground cloves, salt and 
pepper, and into each incision, put two blades of onions with 
one long narrow strip of pork. When the roast is filled in 
this way pack tightly iu ajar and cover with vinegar. Let 
stand two days, turning twice in that time. To cook it, put 
butter and pork in a covered pan, lay in the meat, add a 
little water to prevent burning. Cover closely and let it 
roast for four hours ; season agaiu with pepper and salt, and 
one pulverized laurel leaf, and dish when nicely browned. To 
make the gravy, add two tablespoon fuls of the vinegar in which 
the meat has been pickled to the liquid remaining iu the pan, 
thicken with browned flour. 

87 To Cook a Steak. 

The choice of cut varies with the taste of a family — porter- 
house, tenderloin, round or rump ; the two latter require 
more beatiuo: with the steak beater to break the toucrher fiber. 
Break somewhat the fiber of the meat by beating with the 
steak-beater ; lay the gridiron over bright but not too hot 
coals ; place the steak on it, turn in two minutes, then agaiu 
in two minutes. Take up the steak and press it into some 
soft butter on a warm platter ; turn and press the other side ; 
now lay again on the gridiron and finish by turning once or 
twice. A folding gridiron expedites and siuoplifies the 
cooking of steak. When sufficiently cooked place the steak 
on a warm platter on which is some soft butter, considerable 
salt and a dash of pepper ; turn and press. Serve instantly. 
It is better to have the gentleman of the house wait for his steak 
than have the steak wait for the gentleman — be snubbed for 
having a thing good rather than have it poor. We decline to 
give a receipt for frying steak. 



36 TO BOIL SALT AND FRESH BEEF AND HAM. 



To Boil Salt and Fresh Beef and Ham. 



88 To Boil Pickled Beef. 

Put on the fire in cold water ; let it simmer slowly, allow- 
ing fifteen minutes to every pound ; do not let it boil ; keep 
skimming or it will look dirty ; if it is left in the pot until the 
water is cold it will be much more tender. 



89 Spiced Beef. 

Take a piece of beef from the fore quarter, weighing ten 
pounds. Those who like fat should select a fatty piece ; those 
who prefer lean may take the shoulder clod, or upper part of 
the fore leg. Take one pint of salt, one teacup of molasses or 
brown sugar, one tablespoon of ground cloves, allspice and 
pepper, and two tablespoons of pulverized saltpetre. Place 
the beef in a deep pan ; rub with this mixture. Turn and rub 
each side twice a day for a week. Then wash off the spices ; 
put in a pot of boiling water, and, as often as it boils hard, 
turn in a teacupful of cold water. It must simmer for five 
hours, on the back part of the stove. Press under a heavy 
weight till it is cold, and you will never desire to try 
corned beef of the butcher again. Your pickle will do 
for another ten pounds of beef, first rubbing into it a handful 
of salt. It can be renewed and a piece kept in preparation 
every day. This is good to pickle tongues also. 



TO BOIL SALT AND FRESH BEEF AND HAM. 87 

90 Beef. 

To pickle for drying or boiling, thoroughly rub salt into it 
and let it remain twenty-four hours, to draw off the blood ; 
after which drain and pack as desired ; have ready a pickle 
prepared as follows : For every one hundred pounds of beef, 
^even pounds of salt, one ounce of saltpetre, one quart of 
molasses, eight gallons of soft water; boil and skim well ; when 
cold pour it over the beef; pieces designed for drying should 
be taken out in two weeks, and soaked over night, to take the 
salt from the outside. (See receipt for Pickling Beef and 
Pork.) 

01 Eemains of Roa^.t Beef. 

Take off with a sharp knife all the meat from the bones, 
chop it fine, take cold gravy without the fat, put it in the 
t^pider to heat ; if you have not this, some of the water in 
which the bones were boiled ; when it boils up, sprinkle in salt 
and put in the minced meat ; cover it and let it stand upon 
the fire long enough to heat it thoroughly, then stir in a small 
piece of butter, -toast bread, and lay in a dish, put the meat 
over it ; serve hot. 

92 Boiling Meat. 

There is all the difference in the world between boiling meat 
which is to be eaten, and meat whose juices are to be extracted 
in the form of soup. If the meat is required as nourishment, 
of course you want the juices kept in. To do this it is neces- 
sary to plunge it into boiling water, which will cause the 
albumen in the meat to coagulate suddenly, and act as a plug 
or stopper to all the tubes of the meat, so that the nourish- 
ment will be tightly kept in. The temperature of the water 



38 TO BOIL SALT AND FRESH BEEF AND HAM. 

should be kept at boiling point for five minutes, and then as 
much cold water must be added as will reduce the tempera- 
ture to one hundred and sixty -five degrees. Now if the hot 
water, in which the meat is being cooked, is kept at this 
temperature for some hours, we have all the conditions united, 
which give to the flesh the quality best adapted for its use as 
food. The juices are kept in the meat, and instead of being 
called upon to consume an insipid mass of indigestible fibers, 
we have a tender piece of meat, from which, when cut, the 
imprisoned juice runs freely. If the meat be allowed to remain 
in the boiling water, without the addition of any cold water 
to it, it becomes in a short time altogether cooked, but it will 
be also almost indigestible, and therefore unpalatable. 



93 To Bake a Ham. 

Most persons boil a ham, but a first-rate Virginia house- 
wife tells us it is much better if baked properly. Soak it 
for an hour or more and wipe dry. Next spread it all over 
with a batter made of flour and water ; put it into a deep pan 
with muffin rings or bits of oak wood under it to keep it out 
of the gravy. When fully done — it will take from five to 
seven hours — take off the skin and batter crusted upon tbe 
flesh side and set it away to cool, or glaze it by the following 
receipt : 



94 Cjlazed Ham. 

Beat the yolk of two eggs very light. Spread them all over 
your ham ; then sift over fine cracker crumbs, and set in the 
oven to brown. Currant jelly may be used instead of yolks of 
eggs, and is very nice. 



TO BOIL SALT AND FRESH BEEF AND HAM. 39 

95 To Boil a Ham as it is Done at the Parker House, 

Boston. 

A ham weighing ten or twelve pounds should be boiled six 
hours. Wash and 'scrape the ham well. Put it into cold 
water enough to cover it well and stir into the water a tea- 
cupful of weak lye. Let it come to a boil gradually ; keep 
hot water ready to jSll up the boiler as it evaporates. If it is 
to be eaten cold, have ready a large pan in which to put your 
ham, and cover it with cold water and let it stand an hour or 
two, or until it is cold. Take it up and remove the skin and 
ornament as you choose. 

96 To Stuff a Boiled Ham. 

To a pint of bread crumbs add a tablespoonful of butter, a 
nutmeg, a few cloves, a few grains of allspice, an onion chopped 
fine, thyme, parsley and summer savory, pepper and a little 
salt ; mix all well together. The ham must be cold ; make 
incisions all through^ — a steel not too blunt at point is good to 
use. In this press in the dressing well with the fingers. 
Glaze the ham with yolk of egg, sprinkle with bread crumbs, 
put in stove and brown. 



40 ROAST VEAL — VEAL CUTLETS. 



VEAL. 



9T To Roast a Leg of Veal. 

Take out the bone of the joint ; then fill it with a stuffing. 
(See receipt No. 116.) Bind tight with skewers and cord, 
sprinkle over with pepper and salt, put two or three slices of 
pork in the bottom of the pan, with a teacupful of water. 
Baste well and often. Let a leg weighing twelve pounds cook 
three hours. Just before it is done sprinkle over a little flour 
and rub over it a little butter.' 

For gravy, stir some brown flour in the pan in which the 
veal has been cooked, add a piece of butter size of a walnut, 
and a teacup of stock. 

98 Veal Cutlets. 

Veal cutlets should be cut one inch thick from the leg, 
divide into equal sized pieces, enough for a helping. Have 
ready a bowl of bread crumbs, seasoned with pepper, salt and 
a little summer savory, beat two eggs in a pie plate, dip the 
raw cutlets in the egg, crumb them well and lay into a frying- 
pan, containing a heaping tablespoonful of butter and the 
same of lard ; when it is at a keen boil, over a bright fire, lay 
in your cutlet and fry quickly on one side until a bright 
brown, turn and fry on the other. Let them cook until well 
done. Lay the cutlets on a hot platter, add to the butter in 
the pan a tablespoonful of browned flour, and let heat until 
quite dark ; then pour in gradually a teacupful of milk or 
cream, and scald to a glaze. Pour over the cutlets and serve 
promptly. 



SWEET-BREADS. 41 



SWEET-BREADS. 



99 Veal Sweet-breads 

Spoil very soon ; the moment they come from the butcher's they 
should be put in cold water to soak for about an hour ; lard 
them or draw a lardoon of pork through the center of each 
one ; put into salt boiling water or stock and let boil for fifteen 
or twenty minutes ; throw them into cold water for only a few 
moments, they will now be firm and white ; remove carefully 
the skinny portion and pipes. — Mrs. Henderson. 

100 Sweet-breads, Stewed. 

Wash carefully, remove all bits of skin and fatty matter, 
cover with cold water and heat to a boil ; pour off the hot 
water and cover with cold until the sweet-breads are firm. If 
liked, add butter as for frying before you put in the second 
water ; stir in a very little water the second time. When 
they are tender add for each sweet-bread a heaping teaspoon- 
ful of butter, a little chopped parsley, pepper, salt and a little 
cream. Let them simmer in this gravy for five minutes. Send 
to table in a covered dish with the gravy poured over them. 

101 Sweet-breads, Roasted. 

Parboil and put into cold water for fifteen minutes ; change 
to more cold water for five minutes longer ; wipe perfectly dry, 
lay them in a dripping-pan and roast, basting with butter and 
water until they begin to brown ; then withdraw them for an 



42 SWEET-BREADS. 

instant, roll in beaten egg, then in cracker crumbs, and 
return to the fire for ten minutes longer, basting meanwhile 
twice with melted butter. Keep hot in a dish while you add 
to the dripping half a cup of hot water, some chopped parsley, 
a teaspoonful of browned flour and the juice of half a lemon. 
Pour over the sweet-breads and serve at once. 



102 Sweet-breads, an English Method. 

Wash the sweet-bread and remove all the adhering bits of 
skin, then soak in salt water for one hour, then parboil and 
skim, when half cooked take out and cut into small pieces, or, 
if you prefer, let it remain whole, and stew until tender, then 
add a bit of butter, a little salt, to your taste, a dust of pepper, 
and a teaspoonful of flour thickening. Boil up twice and 
pour over toast. Serve hot. 



103 Broiled Sweet-breads. 

Parboil and blanch by putting them first in hot water and 
keeping it at a fast boil for five minutes. Then plunging it 
into ice-cold water, a little salted. When the sweet-breadi 
have lain in this ten minutes, wipe them very dry, and with 
a sharp knife split them each in half lengthwise. Broil on a 
clear, hot fire, turning every minute as they begin to drip. 
Have ready on a deep plate some melted butter, well salted 
and peppered, mixed with catsup or pungent sauce. When 
the sweet-breads are done to a fine brown, lay them in this, 
Kirning them over several times, and set covered in a 
warm oven. Lay toast upon a plate or chafing-dish and a 
sweet-bread on each, and pour the hot butter, in which they 
have bsen lying, over them, and send to the table. 



SWEET-BREADS. 43 

104: Fried Sweet-breads. 

Parboil them as just explained. Just before serving, cut 
them in even sized pieces, sprinkle over pepper and salt, egg 
and bread crumb them, and fry in hot lard. When done put 
them on a hot dish, turn out part of the lard, leaving about 
half a teaspoouful, pour in a cupful of milk thickened with a 
little flour ; let it cook, stirring constantly, season with pepper 
and salt, strain and pour over the sweet-breads. Serve with 
green peas without sauce. 



44 MUTTON AND LAMB. 



MUTTON AND LAMB. 



105 Mutton and Lamb. 

To roast a leg of mutton or lamb is a very simple process, 
requiring simply to be put in a pan, and thoroughly basted 
and seasoned, baking twelve minutes for every pound of lamb, 
and fifteen for every pound of mutton. 



106 To Boil a Leg of Mutton . 

Plunge the mutton into boiling water and let it scald fifteen 
minutes for every pound ; in extremely cold weather, allow 
half an hour extra boiling. Serve with drawn butter, and 
nasturtions or capers. 



107 Fore Quarter of Lamb, Roasted. 

Have your butcher take out carefully the shoulder blade 
aud fore leg. Stuff the cavity ; close with a skewer or sail 
needle and twine ; cook eleven minutes to the pound, basting 
often. Make a gravy by adding a little browned flour and 
half a teaspoonful of Harvey's sauce to the drippings and 
bastings left in the pan. Serve with mushroom pickles and 
boiled spinach. 



MUTTON AND LAMB. 45v 

108 Fore Quarter of Lamb, Broiled. 

This is the most delicious method of cooking lamb. Choose 
a young and tender, but small forequarter ; have it well 
nicked by the butcher, and forty minutes before dinner place 
it on the gridiron over bright, but not too hot coals ; every ten 
minutes baste it on both sides with a bit of butter and turn on 
the gridiron ; send it to table just off the fire and well buttered ; 
it will make its own gravy; it should be done thoroughly, that 
is, past the pink color demanded by French cooks, but not 
enough to dry the natural juices of the meat. 



46 PORK. 



PORK. 



109 Leg of Fresh Pork, Roasted. 

Score in crossed lines a leg of pork ; run the knife around 
the bone until it is loosened, take out the bone and fill the 
place with a rich stuffing made of stale bread, seasoned with 
butter, salt, pepper and onion ; take a few stitches to prevent 
the stuffing from coining out ; put it on the spit and baste it 
with fresh butter (it is more delicate than lard). Fresh pork 
requires longer cooking than any other meat. Serve with hot 
apple sauce and Irish potatoes, cut in quarters and fried. It 
will take from three to four hours to cook, according to size. 

110 Pork Spare Ribs 

Are best well broiled over a slow fire and served with hot 
apple sauce. 

111 Pork Tenderloins 

Are either fried or broiled. In either case they require to 
be very thoroughly done and served without gravy, simply 
adding a tablespoonful of vinegar to the dripping from the 
gridiron or in the pan. 

11*^ To Broil Salt Pork. 

Soak some thin slices of salt pork in milk for two or three 
hours, lay on the fine double gridiron and turn quickly, so as 
not to scorch ; this makes a delicious supper dish if cooked 



PORK. 47 

aolji eaten promptly. It should not be taken off the coals 
till the family are seated at the table. Serve on a very hot 
dish. 



113 To Pry Salt Pork. 

Salt pork is greatly improved by soaking it in milk two 
or three hours, then rolling it in Indian meal before frying. 

114 To Bake Salt Pork. 

Let it soak over night in skimmed milk, then bake likps 
fresh pork. 

115 Pork and Beans. 

One quart of beans soaked over night in tepid water, in 
which has been dissolved one teaspoonful of soda. Early in 
the morning pour this water off, add two quarts of boiling 
water and half a teaspoonful of soda, boil the beans two hours, 
until the skin cracks. Then drain, put into a bean pot, or 
large tin or earthen dish, in the center of which is a pound 
of salt pork scored in small squares. Let the beans come up 
to the level of the rind of the pork, pour over this one quart 
of boiling water, in which two tablespoonfuls of molasses have 
been stirred. Cover and bake slowly from two to four hours. 
If necessary you may add a teacup more of boiling water.

POULTRY AND GAME. 



116 Turkey and Chicken Stuffing. 

Three teacups of grated bread-crumbs (uo crust and not a 
drop of water), one cup finely chopped suet, two-thirds of a 
cup chopped parsley, a tablespoon ful of sweet marjoram and 
summer savory, one-half teaspoonful of pepper, one teaspoon- 
ful of salt, one or two eggs, beaten. 



117 To Roast a Turkey or Chicken. 

In England and on the continent, neither a turkey nor 
chicken is stuffed ; but not only is the stuffing nice in itself, 
but it gives as well as preserves a fine flavor to the fowl. 
After drawing, washing, drying and singeing a fowl, stuff it 
according to the above recipe, craw and body ; truss it well, 
tying down the legs and fastening the wings. Put into a 
dripping pan (or onto a spit) the bird thus prepared, and let 
it cook till thoroughly done, but not dry. A fourteen-pound 
turkey will take three full hours ; a ten-pound turkey will do 
in two. Save the giblets, consisting of liver, gizzard, and 
heart, boil until tender, and mince fine. When you take up 
your turkey add a little browned flour to the gravy in the 
pan, some hot water, and the minced giblets, a few sprigs of 
parsley about the dish adds greatly to its appearance. Mauy 
persons like fried sausages, or fried oysters, laid about the 
dish, and served with each helping.

118 To Boil a Chicken or Turkey. 

It is not every housewife who knows how best to boil a 
chicken. Plain, artless boiling is apt to produce a yellowish, 
slimy-looking fowl. Before cooking, the bird should always 
be well washed in tepid water and lemon juice, and to insure 
whiteness, delicacy and succulence, should be boiled in a soup 
of flour and water ; after being put in the boiling water 
should be allowed to simmer slowly. This method is very 
effectual in preserving all the juices of the fowl, and the result 
is a more toothsome and nourishing morsel than the luckless 
bird which has been " galloped to death " in plain boiling. 



119 Escaloped Turkey. 

Take the remains of cold turkey, from which remove all 
the bones and gristle ; chop the meat in small pieces. Place 
in an earthen dish a layer of powdered i* cracker, moistened 
with milk; then add a layer of turkey seasoned with pepper 
and salt, then another layer of powdered cracker, and then 
one of turkey, and so on until the dish is filled ; over that 
pour the gravy you may have left, or a little hot water and 
butter. Finish the top with the powdered cracker, moisten 
with a beaten egg and sweet milk, bake one hour. Cover 
the dish for the first half hour, that the top may not become 
too brown. 



130 Prairie Chickens, Partridges and duail. 

Clean nicely, using a little soda in the water in which they 

are washed ; rinse them and drain, and fill with dressing, 

sewing them up nicely, and binding down the legs and wings 

with cord. Put them in a steamer and let them cook ten

50 POULTRY AND GAME. 

minutes. Then put them in a pan with a little butter, set 
them in the oven and baste frequently, until of a nice brown. 
They ought to brown in about thirty-five minutes. Serve 
them in a platter with sprigs of parsley alternated with cur- 
rant jelly. 

121 A Nice Way to Cook Pigeons. 

Stuff the birds with a rich bread dressing ; place compactly 
in an iron or earthen dish ; season with salt, pepper and but- 
ter (or if you like best thin slices of salt pork over the top), 
dredge thickly with flour and nearly cover them with water. 
Then put over a closely fitting plate or cover, and place the 
dish in a moderate oven, from two to four or even five hours, 
according to the age of the birds. If the birds are old and 
tough this is the best way they can be cooked, and they may 
be made perfectly tender and much sweeter than by any other 
process. If the gravy is insuflicient add a little water before 
dishing. 



122 To Pot Birds. 

Prepare them as for roasting. Fill each with a dressing 
made as follows : Allow for each bird of the size of a pigeon 
one-half of a hard boiled Qgg, chopped fine, a tablespoonful of 
bread crumbs, a teaspoonful of chopped pork ; season the 
bird with pepper and salt ; stuflT them, lay them in a kettle 
that has a tight cover. Place over the birds a few slices of 
pork, add a pint of water, dredge over them a little flour, 
cover and put them in a hot oven. Let them cook until ten- 
der, then add a little cream and butter. If the sauce is too 
thin, thicken with flour. One pint of water suflicient for 
twelve birds. 



POULTRY AND GAME. 51 

1^3 Quail on Toast. 

After the birds are well cleaned, cut them open on the 
back, salt and pepper them, and dredge them very lightly 
with flour. Break them down so they will lie flat, and 
broil them on a gridiron, or place them in a pan with 
a little butter and a little water in a hot oven, covering 
them closely for awhile, until about done. Then take 
them up and place in a spider on top of the stove, and let 
them fry a nice brown. Have ready slices of baker's bread 
well toasted and slightly buttered. The toast should be broken 
down with a carving knife to make the crust tender ; on 
this place your quails. Make a gravy of the drippings in the 
pan, thickened very lightly with browned flour, and pour over 
each quail. The quails should only be allowed to fry just 
long enough to brown nicely, and not long enough to dry out ; 
five minutes ought to be sufiicient. 

124 Fricassee Chicken, No. 1 (French Style). 

Cut up a young chicken (even a grown one, if young and 
tender, will do), flavor well, put in a frying-pan one table- 
gpoonful of hot lard, cut up a small onion, let it fry with the 
chicken, adding salt, red and black pepper. Do not cook 
entirely done, and be careful not to scorch ; then pour into 
the frying-pan enough boiling water for the chicken to stew, 
which let it do slowly for an hour, and just before taking off 
add some chopped parsley. 

125 Fricassee Chicken, No. 2. 

Cut up, wash and dry a pair of chickens, put into a stew- 
pan a tablespoonful of butter, let it boil ; lay the chickens into 
this and shake them about, turning them and giving each

piece a little glazed look ; then add water enough to cover the 
fowls and let stew slowly from forty minutes to an hour. Just 
before serving let it come to a keen boil and stir in a teacupful 
of milk or sweet cream, in which a heaping tablespoonful of 
flour has been stirred. Let it cook five minutes and pour into 
a dish over which some freshly baked powder biscuits have 
been opened and spread. Season with salt and pepper. 



126 Escaloped Chicken. 

Cold chicken, chiefly the white meat, one cup of gravy, one 
tablespoonful of butter and one Q^g well beaten, one cup of 
fine bread crumbs, pepper and salt. Take from the chicken 
all gristle and skin, and cut, not chop, into pieces less than 
half an inch long. Have ready the gravy, or some rich 
drawn butter in a saucepan on the fire. Thicken it well, and 
stir into it the chicken; boil up once, take it off* and add the 
beaten e^g ; cover the bottom of a buttered dish with bread 
crumbs, pour in the mixture and put another thick layer of 
crumbs on top, sticking butter all over it. Bake to a delicate 
brown in a quick oven. Turkey may be used instead of 
chicken, also veal. 



127 Chicken Pie, No. 1. 

Stew until tender two chickens in just enough water to stew 
them. Make a nice crust, line a deep dish with it; when the 
chickens are done remove all the bones ; put the chickens in 
the dish in which they are to be baked ; thicken the gravy 
with a little flour and cream ; add a can of oysters ; season 
with salt, pepper and butter ; cover the pie with a crust, and 
bake quickly. This is very nice. 



POULTRY AND GAME. 53 

138 Chicken Pie, ITo. 2. 

Stew two chickens till tender ; take out all the large bones, 
leaving only the wing and second joint of the leg. Make a 
rich crust and roll thicker than ordinary pies. Line the bot- 
tom of the dish with a plainer under crust; lay the chicken in, 
season well with salt and pepper, pour over this about three 
teacupfuls of a rich gravy, made from the water in which 
the fowls are boiled, a teacup of cream and a heaping table- 
spoonful of flour braided with butter, and well scalded. Cover 
with rich paste and bake three-quarters of an hour. Many 
persons like three hard-boiled eggs cut in with the chicken. 



129 Eice and Chicken Pie, No. 3. 

Boil a pint or more of rice ; stir in a teaspoouful of butter, 
a little milk, two eggs and a little salt. Fricassee two chick- 
ens. Cover the bottom of a long dish with rice, then a layer 
of chicken, and so on until it is full. Save out some of the 
gravy of the fricassee to eat on the rice. Cover the whole 
with the yolk of an egg and brown it. Curry may be put into 
the chicken if liked. One chicken makes a good sized dish. 



130 Chicken Jelly. 

Boil the chicken until tender, cut with a knife fine, put it in 
a dish, or mold ; season with salt, pepper, a little summer 
savory, and a teaspoouful of vinegar ; boil the bones in the 
broth awhile and pour over. When cold it will turn out.

tomatoes; boil two hours. Before dishing, add two hard- 
boiled eggs chopped fine, and one in slices, a piece of butter 
the size of a hen's egg, fourteen hard crackers, a little salt, 
very little red pepper, and three teaspoonfuls of Worcester- 
shire sauce. To be served like soup.

132 Potatoes a la Maitre d'Hotel. 

Boil and peel the potatoes and let theiu become cold. Then 
cut them into rather thick slices. Put a lump of fresh butter 
into a stewpau, and add a little flour — about a teaspoonful 
for a middling sized dish. When the flour has boiled a little 
while in the butter, add by degrees a cupful of broth or water. 
When this has boiled up, put in the potatoes with chopped 
parsley, pepper and salt. Let the potatoes stew a few minutes, 
then take them from the fire, and, when quite off* the boil, add 
the yolk of an egg, beaten up with a little lemon juice and a 
tablespoonful of cold water. As soon as the sauce has set, the 
potatoes may be dished up and sent to table. 



133 Boiled Potatoes. 

Potatoes in the spring begin to shrivel and should be 
soaked in cold water several hours before cooking. Put them 
over the fire in cold water (without salt), and when done drain 
ofi*the water, returning them to the fire for a minute or two, 
but not long enough to endanger burning ; then throw in a 
little salt, take hold of the handle and toss the kettle in such a 
way that the potatoes will be thrown u]) and down. When 
they look white and floury they are ready to dish for the table. 
New potatoes should always be put into boiling water, and it 
is better to prepare them only just in time for cooking.

134 Pried Potatoes. 

Pare and slic3 the potatoes thin — if sliced in small flakes 
they look more inviting than when cut in larger pieces — keep 
in ice-water two or three hours — then drain them dry, or dry 
them on a crash towel, and drop them into boiling lard; when 
nearly done take them out with a skimmer and drain them. 
Let them get cold, and then drop them again into boiling lard, 
and fry until well done. This last operation causes them to 
swell up and puff out ; sprinkle with salt, and serve hot — our 
receipt says ; but many like them cold as a relish for tea or 
with cold meats. 

135 Saratoga Potatoes. 

Peel good sized potatoes and cut as thin as your cabbage 
cutter will slice them, and throw into cold water. After 
soaking an hour wipe them dry, and drop into boiling lard 
till a light brown. Skim them out into a colander and 
sprinkle with salt while hot. A wire basket is better to boil 
in, if you have it. 

136 Potato Puff. 

Stir two cupfuls of mashed potatoes, two tablespoon fuls of 
melted butter and some salt to a light, fine and creamy condi- 
tion ; then add two eggs, w^ell beaten (separately) and six table- 
spoonfuls of cream ; beat it all well and lightly together ; pile 
it in a rocky form on a dish ; bake it in a quick oven until 
nicely colored ; it will puff up quite light. 

137 Creaming Potatoes. 

Slice cold boiled potatoes very thin, have ready a saucepan 
of boiling milk, in which place the potatoes, with salt, a good

mixed with water, stirring until delicate and creamy — when 
ready dish for the table. The goodness of this dish depends 
much upon catering, just when ready ; ten minutes being suffi- 
cient time to prepare it. 

138 Potato Puff. 

Two cups cold mashed potatoes, three tablespoonfuls of 
melted butter, beaten to a cream ; add two well beaten eggs,

139 Spring Vegetables and How to Cook Them. 

In March and April salsify, or oyster plant, is a pleasant 
change from boiled turnips and cabbage, and can be prepared 
in various ways. 

First way : Grate a bunch or two of salsify as you would 
horse-radish, add a raw egg beaten, and a little bread crumbs 
or flour, and fry in a frying-pan, as you would oysters. Pars- 
nips prepared in this way, are extremely nice. 

Second way; Cut your salsify into round lozenges, parboil; 
throw it into a frying-pan with a little butter, and heat 
through, but do not fry brown ; turn over this enough soup 
stock, or the boilings from steak or other bones, to cover it; 
thicken with a little flour and butter braided together, add 
pepper and salt, and you have a nice dish. 

140 Oyster Plant. 

Scrape the roots, dropping each into cold water as soon as 
cleaned. Exposure to the air blackens them. Cut in pieces 
an mch long, put into a saucepan with hot water to cover

them, and stew until tender. Turn off the water and add 
soup stock or milk enough to cover them. Stew ten minutes 
after this begins to boil ; put in a great lump of butter cut into 
bits and rolled in flour. Boil up once and serve. 



141 Fried Salsify or Mock Oysters. 

Scrape the roots thoroughly and lay in cold water ten or 
fifteen minutes. Boil whole until tender, and when cold mash 
with a wooden spoon to a smooth paste, picking out all the 
fibers. Moisten with a little milk, add a tablespoonful of but- 
ter, and an egg and a half for every cupful of salsify. Beat 
the egg light. Make into round cakes, dredge witfi flour and 
fry brown. 



142 Cooking Carrots. 

Cut the carrots in small pieces and stew in a little water till 
tender ; pour off what water is left ; put in milk enough to 
make a sauce, and a good lump of butter rolled in flour ; boil 
up again all together, having added salt and pepper to tasite. 
Celery is excellent prepared in the same way. 



143 Potato Fritters. 

Mash and rub through a colander six good boiled potatoes ; 
add a little salt, two tabiespoonfuls of sweet milk or 
cream, two tabiespoonfuls of flour, one egg and the yolks 
of two others; beat the reserved whites to a stiff froth, 
and stir it into the other ingredients, after they are well mixed. 
Have ready a spider of hot lard, and drop by the spoonful, 
and boil as other fritters. This is a delicious breakfast dish.

144 Potato Croquettes. 

Stir two tablespoonfuls of melted butter into two cupfuls of 
cold mashed potatoes till it is light ; add two beaten eggs, one 
teacup of milk ; make into rolls, roll in beaten egg, and then 
in bread crumbs, and then boil in a wire basket in hot lard. 
When brown, take them out and let them drain a few minutes. 
Serve on a folded napkin on a platter. To test the lard, if 
hot enough, put in a piece of bread ; if it browns immediately, 
it is all right. This rule should be observed in fiying all 
varieties of croquettes. 

145 Asparagus. 

While this vegetable is sold on the market at such an 
extravagant price, it is well to know how to make all of it 
available. Cut off the green ends, then chop the remainder 
of the stalk into small pieces, as you would string beans ; boil 
these until they are thoroughly tender, and add the green 
part a few minutes before serving. Have ready some toasted 
bread, season with salt, pepper and butter, having water 
enough to moisten the toast. Or, if preferred to keep the 
bunches whole, set them on end in a small saucepan, leaving 
the green above water, and boil till the white part is tender. 
The steam meantime will cook the tops sufficiently. 

Asparagus should be boiled in fresh water, and when 
thoroughly cooked taken out, salted, laid lengthwise upon a 
piece of toast in a deep dish ; pour over a sauce for asparagus, 
made after this fashion : Take equal parts of flour and but- 
ter, a tablespoonful of each ; mix thoroughly, add water and a 
little salt ; cook in a stewpan ; when done remove from the 
fire, and stir in the beaten yolk of an egg. Some persons cut 
asparagus into inch-long pieces, but a genuine " bon vivant " 
prefers to eat only so much as glides off into his mouth from 
the four-inch-long stalk. 



60 VEGETABLES. 

146 Eadishes. 

Prof. Blot says cut off the root and all the leaves, but the 
center one, or stalk. This should always be left on and eaten, 
as it contains an element which assists in the digestion of the 
radish. Split the radish up into stems, and leave whole at the 
tojD ; serve in fresh ice water. 

147 Spinach. 

To a peck of well w^ashed and picked spinach take a gallon 
of water and three even tablespoonfuls of salt ; boil for ten 
minutes or a trifle more, until tender, drain on a sieve, press 
a little with your hands or butter-ladle to extract the water; 
chop it up fine, jiut it in a stewpan with a quarter of a pound 
of butter, a teaspoonful of salt, a half a teaspoonful of pepper, 
one tablespoonful of vinegar, and one or two of broth or beef 
stock ; set over a bright fire for a few moments, stirring well ; 
lay slices of cold hard-boiled eggs over it in the vegetable dish. 

148 Tomatoes. 

Plain stewed tomatoes perfectly done and seasoned with salt 
and pepper, need only a large lump of butter added, although 
it is quite common to stir in half a teacup of bread or cracker 
crumbs. 

149 Escaloped Tomatoes. 

Peel and cut across the tomato in slices a quarter of an inch 
thick, lay layers of tomato, then sprinkling of fine bread 
crumbs seasoned with pepper and salt, then bits of butter ; 
repeat and end with bread crumbs and butter ; bake an hour 
and a quarter. 



VEGETABLES. 61 

150 Baked Tomatoes. 

One quart of fine smooth tomatoes, one cup of bread 
crumbs, one small onion minced fine, one teaspoonful of white 
sugar, one tablespoonful of butter, melted, cayenne and salt, 
one-half cup good broth. Cut a piece from the top of each 
tomato, with a teaspoon take out the inside, leaving a hollow 
shell, chop the pulp fine, mix the crumbs, butter, sugar, 
pepper, salt and onion. Fill the cavities of the tomatoes with 
the stufl^ing, replace the tops, pack them in a baking dish, and 
fill the interstices with stuffing. Pour the gravy also into 
these; set the dish covered in an oven, and bake half an hour 
before uncovering, after which brown lightly and send to the 
table in the baking dish. 

151 Stuffed Tomatoes. 

Choose large tomatoes ; do not skin them, but scoop out a 
small place at the top, which fill with a stuffing made of bread 
crumbs, minced onion, cayenne and salt ; first fry the onions 
in a little butter, add the bread crumbs, moistened with a 
little water or stock, and seasoned with a very little cayenne 
pepper and enough salt. Fry them a moment ; then fill the 
cavities, allowing the stuffing to project half an inch above 
the tomatoes and smooth it over the top. Bake. 

152 Succotash. 

Cut the corn from a dozen ears of corn, being careful not 
to cut into the cob. Boil one pint of Lima beans in three 
quarts of water two hours ; boil also, the cobs, as they contain 
much saccharine matter, with the beans. Take out the cobs 
and put in the corn. Just before taking up, mix quarter of a 
pound of butter with two tablespoonfuls of flour, some salt 
and pepper. A cup of good cream is a great improvement. 
Let your corn boil only tw^enty minutes. 



62 VEGETABLES. 

153 Green Corn. 

Cut the center of kernels through lengthwise with a sharp 
knife; scrape the inside out with the back of the knife; put 
over and boil with a very little water. After cooking ten 
minutes, add milk, salt, a very little sugar, and plenty of 
butter, and let boil gently for five or ten minutes more. 



154 Corn Oysters, No. 1. 

One dozen grated ears of sweet corn, three tablespoonfuls 
of cream, two do. of flour, one do. of melted butter, one egg 
well beaten ; mix and bake in small cakes on a griddle. These 
are very nice for tea when made from cold boiled ears of corn 
left over from dinner. 



155 Corn Oysters, No. 2. 

One teacup of milk, two eggs, two heaping tablespoonfuls 
of flour and a pinch of salt. Beat all well together and with 
this stir the corn cut from one dozen ears or more, according 
to the size, enough to make a thick mass, having just batter 
enough to bind it together. Drop it by the tablespoonful 
into a frying-pan with enough hot butter or drippings to keep 
it from burning. Serve on a platter, hot. 



156 To Boil Turnips. 

Peel, slice and boil three quarts of turnips till tender, then 
drain and mash as you would potatoes; put one teacup of 
cream with a teaspoonful of salt into a stewpan, pour the 
mashed turnips into it, mix well, and let stew for twenty 
minutes or half an hour; then add a tablespoonful of butter. 



VEGETABLES. 63 

157 Egg Plant. 

Slice the egg plant about half an inch thick, parboil in 
salt and water for about a quarter of an hour; then take out 
and fry in part butter and part lard. These are nice also, 
when each slice is dipped in beaten eggs and bread crumbs, 
and then fried. 



158 Boiled Cauliflower. 

To each half a gallon of water allow one heaped teaspoon- 
ful of salt. Choose cauliflowers that are close and white. 
Trim off the decayed outside leaves, cut the stalk off flat at 
the bottom. Open the flowers a little to remove the insects, 
and let lie in salt and water with the head down, for an hour 
before cooking; then put them into fast boiling water with 
the addition of salt as above. Skim well and boil till tender. 
Serve with melted butter or delicate drawn butter poured over. 



159 To Stew CablDage. 

Parboil in milk and water and drain it, then shred it, put 
it into a stewpan with a small piece of butter, a small cupful 
of cream, and seasoning, and stew tender. 



160 Cabbage Jelly. 

Boil a cabbage in the usual way, and squeeze it in a colan- 
der till perfectly dry, then chop fine; add a little butter, 
pepper and salt; press the whole very closely into an earthen- 
ware mold, and bake one hour, either in an oven or in front 
of the fire. 



64 VEGETABLES. 

161 Cold Slaw. 

Sprinkle a quart of finely chopped cabbage with salt, and 
let it stand an hour ; drain off the brine into a saucepan ; 
pour half a pint of strong vinegar, a piece of butter (size of 
a hickory nut), a teaspoonful of strong mustard (after it has 
been stirred with water), and half the same of pepper; when 
it boils stir in two well-beaten eggs, and three tablespoonfuls 
of sweet cream ; pour hot on the cabbage, and have it cold 
when it is to be served. A very delicious relish with meats. 



YEAST, BREAD AND BISCUIT. 65 



YEAST, BREAD AND BISCUIT. 



163 Old School Presbyterian Yeast. 

Boil two good handfuls of good hops in three quarts of 
water. Strain. When cool stir in one quart of flour, one 
cup of sugar, and a handful of salt. Cover this in a stone 
jar, and let it stand three days in a warm place, stirring it 
occasionally. On the fourth day add one quart of nicely 
mashed potatoes. Let it stand until the day following, when 
it Avill be ready for use. A small teacup is sufficient for five 
loaves of bread. 

This yeast, which has proved most reliable, needs nothing 
to start it, as it is self-raising, and if kept in a cool place will 
keep six weeks in the summer, and three months in cold 
weather. 

It does not foam as do other kinds of yeast, so that one 
who had not used it would think it worthless, but if once 
used its excellency will not be doubted. 

In making bread, a tablespoonful of white sugar to a quart 
of flour is a great improvement to all kinds of bread. 



163 Joanna's Yeast. 

Peel and wash five good sized potatoes, and boil in two 
quarts of water, then mash and add two small cups of flour, 
a handful of salt, and half a cup of sugar, white or brown ; 
add potatoes and flour together, and mix slowly in the scald- 
ing water in which the potatoes were boiled, and strain all 
5 



66 YEAST, BREAD AND BISCUIT. 

through the colander. Then add the sugar, salt, and a cup 
of yeast, baker's or home-made, or a yeast cake ; keep in a 
warm place until it rises, and then put away in an earthen 
crock. 

Bread made with the above yeast. Sift two quarts of 
flour and add a little salt, boil three or four potatoes and 
mash in three pints of water and stir in with a cup full of 
yeast. Keep in a warm place over night. 

164: Hop Yeast. 

Of pressed hops, break up line about enough to make a 
teacupful ; boil them in one quart of water for half an hour. 
At the same time boil in another kettle ten or twelve potatoes 
(peeled) in a quart of water; when thoroughly done mash the 
potatoes and pour the water back over them. If the water is 
boiled away restore the quantity. Have ready two quarts of 
sifted flour; strain the hop water on to it, and add the potato 
gruel; wheu lukewarm put in a teacupful of good yeast, or a 
yeast cake, and a little salt. After it is thoroughly light it 
should be kept in a stone jug or jar in a cool place. 

165 Mrs. Isham's Potato Yeast. 

Pare four potatoes and boil in one quart of water, when 
done mash them fine, and jiour on them the water in which 
they were boiled, one teaspoon ful of salt, one-half cup of 
brown sugar. When cold add half a teacupful of baker's 
yeast. Put in a warm place to rise. 

166 Esther's Bread. 

To make the yeast : Take ten or twelve potatoes from the 
dinner pot, wet two teacupfuls of flour with two cups of boil- 
ing potato water, add half a teacup of white sugar and one heap- 



YEAST, BREAD AND BISCUIT. 67 

ing tablespoonful of salt ; raise twenty-four hours with a Twin 
Brothers or Capitol Yeast Cake. This will last a week or 
ten days. One cup and a half is enough for four loaves of the 
bread. Scald skim milk ; when cool enough sponge your 
bread at night ; in the morning work it well, let it rise, then 
put it in the pan and let it rise again ; bake in a quick oven. 



167 To Sponge Bread. 

Sift four quarts of flour into a deep pan, sprinkle a dessert 
gpoonful of salt over it. Make a hole in the center and add 
by degrees three pints of luke-warm water or skim milk ; stir 
the flour into this till it reaches the consistency of a very thick 
cream ; add one and a half cups of Esther's yeast, or one cup 
of Joanna's yeast, or two yeast cakes, or five cents' worth 
of compressed or German yeast, or three cents' worth of 
bakers' yeast, or two tablespoonfuls of brewers' yeast. Ger- 
man and brewers' yeast requires but two hours, the others all 
night, to raise them. 

168 Brown Bread. 

One quart of corn meal, one pint of rye or Graham flour, 
one quart of sour milk, one teacup of molasses, and one tea- 
spoonful of soda. Steam four hours, or bake one hour. This 
quantity will make two loaves. 

169 Corn Bread. 

One quart of Indian meal, two ounces of butter, as much 
warm milk as will make a stiff batter, four eggs, a little salt. 
Beat the whole well together, and bake in shallow tins in a 
moderate oven. 



'68 YEAST, BREAD AND BISCUIT. 

lYO Mrs. A.'s Corn Bread. 

Two cupfuls of corn meal, two ciipfuls of flour, one cupful 
of sweet milk, one cupful of sour milk, one-half cupful of sugar, 
two eggs, one tablespoonful of melted butter, one teaspoonful 
of soda, and a little salt. 

171 PMllis' Corn Bread. 

One pint of sour milk, one-half pint of sweet milk, one tea- 
spoonful of saleratus, one teaspoonful of salt, one tablespoonful 
of lard or butter. White Indian meal stirred in to make a 
batter thick as for muffins. If the meal is perfectly sweet stir 
it in dry. If not, scald it first. 

172 Trench Bread. 

Mrs. Henderson, in her '* Practical Cooking,'* gives this 
recipe which we copy in full, although it is very like the old 
Southern snap bread : Put a heaping tablespoonful of hops 
and a quart of water over the fire to boil. Have ready five 
or six large, freshly boiled potatoes, which mash fine ; strain 
the hops, now put a pint of the boiling water in which the po- 
tatoes were cooked over three cupfuls of flour; mix in the 
mashed potatoes, then the quart of strained hop-water hot, a 
heaping teaspoonful of sugar and the same of salt; when this 
is lukewarm, mix in one and a half Twin Brothers yeast cakes 
that have been softened in a little warm water. Let this stand 
over night in a warm place. 

In the morning a new process is in order. First, pour 
over the yeast a tablespoonful of warm water in which is dis- 
solved half a teaspoonful of soda. Mix in lightly about ten 
and a half heaping teacupfuls of sifted flour. No more flour 
is added to the bread during its kneading. Instead the hands 



YEAST, BREAD AND BISCUIT. 69 

are wet in lukewarm winter. Now knead the dough, giving 
it about eight or ten strokes ; then taking it from the side next 
to you pull it up into a long length, then double it, throwing 
it down snappishly and heavily. Wetting the hands again^ 
give it the same number of strokes or kneads, pulling the end 
towards you again and throwing it onto the part left in the 
pan ; continue this process until large bubbles are formed in 
the dough. It will take half an hour or longer. The hands 
should be wet enough at first to make the dough rather sup- 
ple. If dexterously managed it will not stick to the hands 
after a few minutes, and when it is kneaded enough it will be 
very elastic, full of bubbles and will not stick to the pan ; 
then put the pan away again in a warm place to rise. This 
will take one or two hours. Now comes another new process : 
Sprinkle plenty of flour on the board and take out lightly 
enough dough to make one loaf of bread, remembering that 
French loaves are not large nor of the same shape as the usual 
home-made ones — draw it long so as not to spoil the grain of 
the bread, and with tlie rolling-pin roll it slightly out in the 
middle ; take these middle flaps and fold, first one and then 
the other, into the center of the dough, draw it out long, turn 
the dough completely over and draw it long into the conven- 
tional shape. Turn a large dripping pan bottom side up, 
sprinkle plenty of flour on it upon which lay this and the suc- 
ceeding loaves a little distance apart. Set the pan by the fire 
again to rise yet another twenty-five or thirty minutes longer ; 
then bake. 

173 Ways of Baking Qraham Tlour. 

By this time everybody knows how to make Graham 
" gems " by the usual method, which is simply to stir the bat- 
ter just a little stiffer than griddle-cake batter, and bake 
quickly in a very hot oven. One thing is certain, the thinner 



70 YEAST, BREAD AND BISCUIT. 

the batter the hotter must be the oven. It is also the case 
that gems mixed with water require a hotter oven than those 
mixed with milk. So, if you can not have a very hot oven, 
either make the mixture of simple Graham flour and water 
quite thick, or mix the flour with milk. Skimmed milk is 
good enough, though new or creamy milk makes the bread 
more " short," of course. Have the gem pans very hot (I set 
them in the oven before filling them), and then a scrap of 
cloth with the least bit of butter upon it, rubbed over the irons, 
will prevent the gems from sticking. 

Housekeepers who have no gem-pans can make very nice 
warm Graham bread for breakfast in several ways. Make a 
dough of flour and sweet milk (skimmed or creamy as you 
prefer or find convenient), stiff enough to roll out easily. 
Knead this a little, roll it an inch thick, and cut it into dia- 
monds or cut off strips and make it into rolls with the hand, 
or roll it into rolls two inches in diameter, flattening them a 
little or not at all, as you choose ; or roll the dough very thin 
and cut it into square crackers, pricking them well to prevent 
their puffing. Crackers are best with some cream in the mix- 
ing, and crackers require more kneading than diamonds and 
rolls, which are expected to be soft inside. 

Any of these kinds of bread — diamonds, rolls, balls and 
crackers — are baked upon the grate in the oven, which should 
be wiped off cleaii. They will not stick to it, and will bake 
very fast. I recommend the crackers in particular. All these 
breads are sweeter and better, I think (and we all think so at 
our house), without salt, but most people prefer salt in the 
crackers. — Hearth and Home. 

174 Graham Bread, No. 1. 

One quart of Graham flour, three-quarters of a cup of yeast, 
one quart of water, warm, one cup of molasses. Let this rise 



YEAST, BREAD AND BISCUIT. 71 

over night. Mix with wheat flour in the morning into a stiff 
loaf; let it rise a second time, afterwards put into loaves to 
rise for baking. Very good. 



175 Qraham Bread, No. 2. 

Make the sponge as for white bread ; then knead in Graham 
flour, only sifting part of it ; add also two or three tablespoon- 
fuls of molasses. 

176 Graham Crems. 

One pint of milk, one cup wheat flour, one cup of Graham 
flour, one egg, a little salt. Have the irons hot before using. 

177 Steamed Loaf. 

Two cups Indian meal, one cup flour, half-cup molasses, 
salt, one cup sweet milk, one of sour, teaspoon soda. Steam 
from three to four hours. 

178 Light Biscuit. 

With one quart of boiled milk when nearly cold, mix flour 
to form a thick sponge, add half a cup of good hop yeast, 
beat fifteen miuutes. Let it rise four or five hours, or over 
night; then add two-thirds of a cup of shortening (butter 
and lard, half and half), two tablespoonfuls of sugar, and a 
little salt, stirring in the flour with a large wooden spoon 
until the dough cleaves from the spoon. Roll out to 
an inch or less in thickness ; mold into cakes and let them 
stand in a w^arm place till thoroughly light. Bake in a 
quick oven. These are old-fashioned and excellent. 



72 YEAST, BREAD AND BISCUIT. 

179 Parker House Eolls. 

Scald a little more than a pint of milk, let it stand till 
cold ; two quarts of flour ; make a hole in the middle of the 
flour after rubbing into it a tablespoonful of lard or butter, 
then add a half teacup of yeast, a little sugar, salt, and the 
milk, and cover with the flour. Let it stand until morning, 
then work until smooth. When it is light roll out and cut 
with a pint pail cover; rub it over with a little butter and 
lap over like a turnover, then let them and bake twenty min- 
utes. They are splendid and never fail if the directions are 
followed. 

180 French Eolls. 

One pint of milk, one quart of flour, whites of two eggs, 
one tablespoonful of white sugar, a piece of butter the size of 
an egg. First take the milk and flour, with a tablespoonful 
of yeast, and make a sponge. If made of bakers' or home- 
made yeast, it can be set at night. When the sponge is light, 
add the other ingredients and set to rise again ; roll out to 
half an inch in thickness; cut with an oval cutter ; bake in 
a quick oven.

181 Rusks. 

One cup of yeast, one quart bowl of milk, three eggs, salt, 
one-quarter of a pound of butter, enough flour to mix not so 
hard as bread dough. Knead the biscuits in the hand from 
the pan without rolling out, to make them more soft and 
spongy.

182 French Breakfast Roll. 

Take of good bread dough that is ready for its last rising 
what would make a large loaf of bread ; cut from this pieces 
of dough about the size for a good biscuit, roll it under your 
hand till it is round; flatten it a little and then let it stand on 
your molding board till the last of the rolls are finished; 
then let them remain five minutes " to prove." At the end 
of that time have a saucer of sofc, nice lard ready. Dip 
the ball of your hand in the the lard, and press the whole 
weight of *' the heel of your hand " across the center of each 
roll so as to dent it almost through. Then fold it over and 
place in a pan so that they do not touch ; let rise. Hop yeast 
will bring them up in an hour. They should then bake in 
twelve minutes. — 0' Nell's Receipt. 

183 Rusks. 

Add to one quart of bread dough the beaten yolks of three 
eggs, half a cupful of butter, and one cupful of sugar;

184 Pie Paste Biscuit. 

One pound of flour, three-quarters of a pound of butter. 
Wash the butter and add salt to the flour; mix with cold 
Wiiter, taking care not to get too wet. Cut the remainder of 
the butter into bits the size of a walnut, and roll them into 
the flour as thin as possible. Then roll the paste into a sheet 
and place the bits close together over it, dredge with flour, 
fold up and roll out again, and put on the remaining bits of 
butter, dredge and fold up as before ; roll out thicker than 
for pie-crust, cut with a biscuit cutter and bake in a quick 
oven. These biscuits are nice to be eaten Avith salads, cold 
fowl or ham, and convenient, as they do not require butter.

Into a quart of lukewarm water stir half a teacup of good 
hop or potato yeast, a teaspoon of salt, a tablespoonful of but- 
ter, and flour enough to make a batter, or sponge, that will 
drop from the spoon. Set it in a warm place to rise ; it will 
take from five to eight hours. Set over night for breakfast, 
and after breakfast for tea. Grease your muffiu rings, put a 
tablespoonful of the batter in each ring and bake, turning as 
they require it. A griddle bakes nicer muffins than an oven.

teacup of hop yeast or its equivalent in German yeast, four 
eggs, half a teaspoonful of fine sugar, three teacupfuls of 
milk ; mix at night ; drop the dough from a spoon into muffin 
rings on a pan, and set it to rise till morning ; bake half an 
hour, or on a griddle, turning to bake both top and bottom. 



195 Eice Muffins. 

Two cups of milk, four tablespoonfuls of yeast, one table- 
spoonful of white sugar, two tablespoonfuls of melted butter, 
nearly a cup of well-boiled rice, four cups of flour, or enough

ful of soda dissolved in hot water, added just before baking. 
Beat the ingredients well together, set to rise for six hours or 
until very light; put into muffin rings, let it stand fifteen 
minutes, and bake quickly ; eat hot.

but dry griddle — no grease whatever must be used ; let it 
bake on one side, then turn and bake on the other ; have a 
napkin warmed and lay the scone in it, covering, while a sec- 
ond scone is baking ; when you have three baked fold your 
napkin close over them and send to table piping hot. Tear 
them open and butter. They are very nice. 



MU6H, OATMEAL, RICE. 81 



MUSH, OATMEAL RICE. 



208 How to Make Mush. 

Very few people know how to make this dish as it should 
be. The ingredients for a dish of mush are winter, salt and 
corn meal. The water should be soft, and the salt fine, and 
tlie meal of the first quality ; yellow meal gives the best color, 
but white meal is the more easily cooked. The water should 
be boiling hot at the commencement, middle and end of the 
operation. Tlie meal should be added very slowly, so as to 
prevent any lumps being formed, the cook stirring all the time, 
and should never be in such quantities as would bring down 
the temperature of the water below the boiling point. Herein 
lies the secret of making good mush. Mush should be thor- 
oughly cooked. 

309 Corn Mush. 

Put one quart of water on the stove to boil. Stir into a pint 
of cold milk, one pint of corn meal and one teaspoouful of 
salt. When the water boils, pour in the mixture gradually, 
stirring all well together. Let it boil one hour ; stir it often. 



210 Oat Meal. 

Put four tablespoonfuls of oat meal into one quart of 
cold water ; add one teaspoonful of salt. Let it cook slowly 
for from one to two hours, adding hot water when needed, just 
•before serving stir in one teaspoonful of butter.

82 MUSH, OATMEAL, RICE. 

211 Cracked Wheat. 

Cracked wheat is very nice cooked just like the oat meal. 

212 Boiled Rice. 

To one-half pound of rice use about five pints of water. Let 
it simmer about twenty minutes. Handle carefully, not to 
break the kernels. 

213 Cocking Oat Meal. 

Oat meal is not usually liked because its preparation is not 
properly understood. It requires very long and steady cook- 
ing. Take one teacup of oat meal to five of water. If your 
breakfast is early it does not hurt it to begin the night before 
by mixing the oat meal smooth in cold water, then pour into 
boiling water, adding a little salt to season. Keep this water 
at a boiling point for two hours, and just before it is thor- 
oughly cooked, add a little milk to whiten and improve the 
flavor. Stir thoroughly at intervals. 



MACARONI. 83 



MACARONI. 



214 Macaroni. 

One quarter of a pound of macaroni boiled in water with a 
little salt twenty or thirty minutes. When done drain off the 
water and keep the saucepan covered ; roll two tablespoonfula 
of butter in four of flour ; boil half a pint of cream, and one 
pint of milk ; to which add the butter and flour and boil until 
it thickens. Stirring all the time ; butter a dish, and put in 
a first layer of macaroni ; then grate over this an ounce of 
cheese, and pour a portion of the sauce. Repeat this four 
times, which will fill your dish (use a quarter of a pound of 
cheese in all). Bake ten minutes. 

215 Macaroni a la Solferino. 

To half a pound of macaroni boiled in water and well 
drained, add half an onion, a slice of raw ham chopped fine 
and then browned. Moisten the mixture with tomato sauce, 
or a layer of fried tomatoes ; just before serving sprinkle the 
whole with grated cheese, and serve very hot. 

216 Macaroni. 

Soak a quarter of a pound of macaroni half an hour, in just 
enough water to cover it. Then put it in a buttered dish, add 
salt, butter and pepper. Grate over it about an ounce of 
cheese. Stir two eggs into one cup of milk, and pour over. 
Bake twenty minutes. 

The appearance of macaroni is improved by laying strips 
of puff-paste cut with a paste jigger over the top, crossing 
them as you would for a tart. 



84 EGGS. 



EGGS. 

217 Boiled Eggs. 

When the water is at a keen boil, lift the pot from the fire, 
and put the eggs in, and let them stay exactly four minutes. 
Serve pinned up in a warm napkin. 

Another method is to keep the eggs in water at a keen boil 
for exactly two minutes and three-quarters. 



218 Poached Eggs. 

Salt the water well, and when just ready to boil drop the 
egg which has been broken carefully into a saucer in and let 
stand till done, which can be seen by the white being cooked. 
Serve on buttered toast. Dust a little salt and pepper on the 
top. 



219 Scrambled Eggs. 

Have your spider hot and buttered as soon as you are ready 
with six eggs broken into a dish, to which you add a little salt, 
a " shake " of pepper, a bit of butter the size of nutmeg, and 
half a cup of rich, sweet milk if you have it; it will do with- 
out. Beat up a little, just enough to break up the eggs, then 
pour into the buttered spider. Scrape your spoon back and 
forth to prevent their adhering to the bottom of the spider. 
Do not cook too dry, a few minutes will cook them. This i& 
nice for breakfast or lunch. 



EGGS. 85 

220 Egg Omelet (Very Nice). 

Five well-beaten eggs, one and a half cups of milk, three 
tablespoonfuls of flour; mix the flour in a little of the milk, 
and rub smooth, then add milk and flour to eggs, and beat 
Avell together; grease well with lard a frying-pan ; put in, when 
not very hot, a large tablespoonful, it will cover about half; 
turn with knife when light brown, and roll up as it browns. 

221 Ham Omelet. 

One-half pint of milk, two teaspoonfuls of flour, three tea- 
spoonfuls of cracker crumbs, six eggs. Put thinly and evenly 
over the griddle ; then immediately scatter over it finely 
minced ham. Double it, then fold again in a quarter circle. 

222 Omelet. 

Set a smooth frying-pan on the fire to heat ; break five eggs 
into a bowl ; put butter the size of an egg into a heated pan, 
give twelve strong beats to your eggs, and when the butter 
begins to boil, pour in the eggs. Draw up the eggs from the 
bottom of the pan, but do not stir, simply shake the pan. 
When the bottom is well done and the top a little soft, fold 
over and put on a platter. Serve immediately. This may 
be varied by the addition of three tablespoonfuls of milk. 

223 Baked Eggs. 

Six eggs, four tablespoonfuls good gravy, veal, beef or 
poultry ; the latter is particularly nice ; one handful of bread 
crumbs, six rounds of buttered toast or fried bread. 

Put the gravy into a shallow baking dish, break the eggs 
into this, pepper and salt them, and strew the bread crumbs 



86 EGGe. 

over them. Bake for five minutes in a quick oven. Take 
up the eggs carefully, one by one, and lay upon the toast, 
which must be arranged on a l;ot, flat dish. Add a little 
cream, and if you like, some very finely chopped parsley and 
onion to the gravy left in the baking-dish, and turn it into a 
saucepan. Boil up once quickly, and pour over the eggs. 

224 Eggs Sur le Plat. 

Six eggs, one tablespoonful of butter or nice dripping, pep- 
per and salt to taste. Melt the butter on a stone china or 
tin plate, or shallow baking-dish. Break the eggs carefully 
into this, dust lightly with pepper and salt, and put into a 
moderate oven until the whites are well set. Serve in the 
dish in which they were baked. 



SALADS. 87 



SALADS. 

Chicken Salad 

Is eminently an American dish, and Detroit is quite cele- 
brated for its delicious chicken salads. Our entertainments 
may not be as showy as in other western cities, but our caterers 
understand that the stale salads of a previous party can never 
be freshened. Mrs. Henderson makes a suggestion which we 
have found work very nicely, that she calls ^^ marinating the 
chicken." Mix the celery and chicken together, and then stir 
well into them a mixture in the proportion of three table- ' 
spoonfuls of vinegar to one of oil and one (level) of salt, a 
pinch — the smallest pinch — of cayenne, about what would lie 
on the point of a penknife, and a teaspoonful of mixed mus- 
tard. Let the chicken stand in this mixture an hour or two ; 
drain oflf what may be in the bottom of the bowl ; ten or twenty 
minutes before serving pour over a mild mayonnaise. Little 
strips of anchovy rolled up are used with pickles, hard boiled 
eggs, and lettuce heads, or tender yellow celery tops to gar- 
nish. 

We give as minute directions as possible for the various 
methods and tastes in mixing the dressing. 

An eight-pound turkey, rubbed with a fresh lemon, and 
boiled in well salted water (having two tablespoon fuls of raw 
rice in it), is used and preferred by many to a pair of chickens. 
The flavor is radically different, but quite delightful. Every 
one of the receipts given will make a nice salad, unless our 
scholars fall into the error of a well-meaning lady, who set 
her dish of salad into the hot oven for half an hour. The 
colder your salad is the crisper and fresher it will taste, and 
the thicker and better will be your dressing. 



88 SALADS. 

2*^5 Chicken Salad, No. 1. 

One chicken, three bunches of celery, four eggs (whites and 
yolks beaten separately), one or two tablespoonfuls of mixed 
mustard, two teaspoonfuls of salt, one level teaspoonful of pep- 
per, one tablespooiiful of butter (hard), six or eight table- 
spoonfuls of vinegar. Set the dish w^ith these ingredients into 
a pan of boiling water on the stove, and stir until it thickens 
like custard ; then set off to cool. Cut the chicken, that has 
been carefully boiled, into little pieces, and the celery also, 
and pour over them the dressing, adding, if you please, a little 
olive oil and sweet cream. 

**^26 Chicken Salad, No. 2. 

Two common sized fowls, one teacuj^ful of fresh sweet oil, 
half a jar of French mustard, the yolks of ten eggs (boiled 
hard), half a pint of vinegar, one level saltspoonful of cay- 
enne pepper, eight heads of celery, one tablespoonful of salt, 
or more if required. Boil the fowls and put sufficient salt in 
the water to make them palatable. When they are perfectly 
cold, cut the meat from the bones in pieces about a quarter of 
an inch in size. Cut the white part of the celery, about the 
same, and set them away in separate dishes. Mash the eggs 
to a paste with the oil, then add the vinegar and mustard, 
cayenne and salt. Mix them all thoroughly. When the 
dressing is made it must not be poured over the salad until 
about half an hour before it is to be used, as the celery 
becomes wilted, and the salad soaked. Mix all with a fork, 
tossing the celery and chicken together first. 

23^ Chicken Salad. 

Boil until tender two nice fowls ; throw into the w^ater a 
small handful of rice, which will make the meat white. When 
cold cut with a sharp knife into pieces about one quarter inch

square ; add one quart celery cut coarse, mix well together ; 
boil six eggs very hard, take the yolks and stir with the bowl 
of a spoon, adding one gill of table oil or melted butter, 
until the consistency of cream, one teaspoonful of pepper, two 
tablespoonfuls mixed mustard, one teacup strong vinegar, 
one-half cup grated horse-radish, one-half cup sugar, one 
tablespoonful salt ; beat well one-half hour before using; mix 
well with the chicken before serving. Ornament the top of 
the dish with the tops of the celery and the whites of the eggs. 

228 Chicken Salad. 

Two chickens cut coarse, eight heads of celery cut — not 
chopped — coarse, one teacup boiled ham, chopped fine. 
Dressing — One pint vinegar, three eggs, one tablespoon of 
ilour, one tablespoon sugar, one-half tablespoon of mustard, eight 
tablespoonfuls of melted butter, or the oil from the top of 
the chicken, salt and pepper ; mix the other ingredients 
together and stir in the vinegar boiling hot. When cold, stir 
the dressing with the chicken, celery, etc. 

229 Mrs. Henry Smith's Chicken Salad Dressing. 

For the white meat of two chickens, take a coffee cup of 
very strong vinegar ; the yolks of five eggs, well beaten ; but- 
ter the size of an egg ; one tablespoonful of made mustard 
(thick) ; two teaspoonfuls of salt; a little white pepper. 
Cook the dressing over hot water, as you would a custard, 
until thick, stirring constantly ; add the beaten wdiites. Have 
twice as much celery as chicken, and cut both up instead of 
chopping. Just before serving mix the meat and celery, then 
add to the dressing a cup of very rich sweet cream ; beat well 
and pour over the chicken and celery, and stir it for a 
moment.

230 Miss Smith's Mayonnaise. 

Five eggs, beateu separately ; two tablespoonfuls of mixed 
mustard ; butter the size of an egg ; two teaspoonfuls of salt ; 
one teaspoouful red pepper ; three tablespoonfuls of the finest 
table oil; one pint of thick cream. Scald* the cream, stir in 
the yolks, and continue to stir until it be^ns to thicken ; then 
add the mustard, salt, etc., and two or three tablespoonfuls of 
very strong vinegar; then let it cool, and add the whipped 
froth of the eggs. Beat all thoroughly together. Do not pour 
over the chicken and celery until just before using. 

231 Mayonnaise Sauce. 

Put the uncooked yolk of an egg into a cold bowl ; beat it 
well with a silver fork ; then add two saltspoonfuls of salt, 
and one saltspoonful of mustard powder ; work them well a 
minute before adding the oil ; then mix in a little good oil, 
which must be poured in very slowly (a few drops at a time) 
at first, alternated occasionally with a few drops of vinegar. 
In proportion as the oil is used, the sauce should gain consis- 
tency. When it begins to have the appearance of jelly, alter- 
nate a few drops of lemon juice with the oil. When the egg 
has absorbed a gill of oil, finish the sauce by adding a very 
little pinch of ca^^enue pepper, and one and a half teaspoon- 
fuls of good vinegar ; taste it to see if there is sufficient of 
salt, mustard, cayenne and vinegar. If not, add more very 
carefully. These proportions will suit most tastes ; yet some 
like more mustard and more oil. Be cautious not to use too 
much cayenne. By beating the egg a moment before adding 
the oil, there is little danger of the sauce curdling ; yet if by 
adding too much at first, it should possibly curdle, immedi- 
ately interrupt the operation ; put the yolks of one or two eggs 
on another plate ; beat them well, and add the curdled mayon- 



SALADS. 91 

naise by degrees, and- finish by adding more oil, lemon juice, 
vinegar, salt and cayenne, according to taste. If lemons are 
not at hand, may use vinegar instead. 

23*^ Dressing for Salad. 

Four eggs beaten light, yolks and whites together; two 
tablespoon! uls of mixed mustard, one teaspoonful of salt, one 
teaspoonful of black pepper, or one-third of a teaspoon of red 
pepper, one tablespoonful of butter, and nearly one teacupful 
of sharp vinegar. Float the pan containing the ingredients in 
a pan of boiling water on the stove and stir until it is thick 
like custard. AVhen cold pour over the salad, adding cold 
vinegar if needed. 



233 German Salad Dressing. 

The yolks of three hard boiled eggs, put through a sieve, 
the yolks of three raw eggs, one teaspoonful of salt. Beat 
well together until cream-like, then add a pint of olive oil, 
one cup of vinegar, a little pepper, and a little sugar. Beat 
all well together until light, cold and creamy. Add capers if 
used for fish dressing. 

234 Dressing for Mayonnaise. 

The yolks of four eggs, beaten light with a silver fork; then 
add, drop by drop, a teacupful of the finest salad oil, two 
small onions, and a small bunch of celery, minced very fiiae ; 
pour this over a white fish that has been boiled in salted and 
spiced water flavored with a lemon (juice and rind) ; remove 
the bones from the fish ; when cold, pile into a shape, and as it 
comes to table pour over the dressing.

335 Lobster Salad. 



Use the *' Mayonnaise Sauce," only adding to it two or three 
teaspoonfuls of anchovy sauce and a saltspoonful of Worcester- 
shire sauce ; celery or lettuce in less proportions than for 
chicken salad. Pickled walnuts or olives make a nice garnish 
for this salad. 



236 Shrimp Salad. 

Take canned shrimps and pour over them the dressing 
recommended for lobster salad. They make a nice pic-nic 
dish. 

237 Salad Dressing. 

Two eggs, raw ; one-half teaspoonful of mustard flour, one 
tablespoonful of butter, eight tablespoonfuls of vinegar. Heat 
it, putting the bow4 into the tea-kettle, until it l^ecomes as 
thick as cream. 



238 Salad Dressing, No. 2. 

The yolks of two hard boiled eggs rubbed very fine with a 
silver spoon, one yolk of a raw egg, one small boiled or baked 
[)otato ; to these add one tablespoonful of mixed mustard ; 
blend the two thoroughly, then stir in one-half cup of thick, 
sweet cream and one tablespoonful of melted butter, or one 
teacup of the purest salad oil ; a little salt and cayenne, and, 
if desired, a dash of anchovy or Worcestershire sauce. Last 
of all, add little by little, vinegar enough to make the whole 
a smooth, creamy mass, and pour it on the lettuce just before 
serving.

whites beaten separately ; put all over the fire together, vine- 
gar last, and stir till the consistency of boiled custard ; add 
the whites of eggs and bottle. 

340 Potato Salad 

Can be made a delicious and rather complicated dish, like 
*' the beggars' stone soup." Take six boiled potatoes steaming 
from the pot, cut them in slices, pepper and salt a little, lay 
over a shadow of very thinly sliced onion, a sprig of parsley 
or so cut very fine, some olives cut fine or left whole, as 
garnishes, two or three red beets sliced like the potatoes, some 
scraps of red herring or sardines, a cucumber pickle or two 
€ut into small dice, and some pickled French beans. Over 
this pour the following : 

241 French Dressing for a Salad. 

Put into three tablespoonfuls of the purest salad oil a heap- 
ing saltspoon or level teaspoonful of salt, one even teaspoonful 
of scraped onion, one tablespoonful of vinegar, one teaspoon- 
ful of tarragon or pepper vinegar. Beat for a few moments 
with a fork, and pour over a vegetable salad. 



242 Simple Potato Salad. 

Boil your potatoes, then skin and slice while hot, into a 
a covered vegetable dish ; have all ready a dressing. One-third 
of a teacup of boiling water, one-third or more of vinegar,

and a little more oil than vinegar; dice a small onion thin, 
and lay between the layers of potato ; when the dish is full 
pour the dressing over it ; cover, and put away to cool ; just 
before serving, stir it with a salad fork or spoon. Mix the 
oil, vinegar, salt and pepper well together, and then add the 
hot water. 



243 Tresh Tomatoes 

Make a delightful salad sliced and having a tablespoonful 
of vinegar, a teaspoonful of oil, a saltspoonful of mustard, 
and a saltspoonful of salt poured over them. 



244 Tomato Mayonnaise 

Is also nice, using the mayonnaise sauce very cold, and having 
the tomatoes very cold before the one is poured over the other.

PIES. 

345 Pastry. 

One pound and a quarter of flour, one pound of shortening 
and a little salt, all cut together, sufficient cold water to 
mix with ; no more flour. Put upon the molding board, roll 
out and cut in strips, put one upon another, then cut ofl" in 
squares, roll out and put upon plates. 

24:6 Plain, but Good Pamily Pie-Crust. 

One pound of flour, half a pound butter, mix thoroughly 
with a knife or spoon. Pour in very cold water, just enough 
to form a dough for rolling out ; flour the board and rolling 
pin, using a knife to handle the dough (the warmth of the 
hand makes it heavy); roll out the size of one plate at a time, 
so as to work it as little as possible. Bake in a quick oven. 

247 Prof. Blot's Heoeipt for Pie-Crust. 

One pound of flour, wet with water ; then stir in one pound 
of butter, cut in small pieces, and roll out. 

248 Plain Pie-Crust for Two Pies. 

Three cups of sifted flour, one cup of lard, a little salt, 
water enough to wet it ; stir with a knife and roll out. Roll 
butter in the upper crust three times, sprinkle a little flour 
over butter, and roll out. 



96 PIES. 

349 Tart Crust. 

The white of one egg beaten to a stiif froth, one tablespoon 
white sugar, one cup of lard, a little salt, five tablespoons of 
water, three cups of sifted flour; roll quite thin fjr tarts ; cut 
out with a cook}'- cutter — a scalloped one will look best; take 
an open-top thimble, make five holes in one, lay on a whole 
one, which makes one tart; proceed with all the dough 
in the same way ; bake lightly, when done split open the tart 
and lay a slice of nice jelly between the layers ; squeeze up the 
jelly through the holes ; place them on the table on a plate 
and you have a splendid-looking dish for the tea table, and 
something that will keep two months. Do not put your jelly 
in till you wish them for the table. 

250 Rich Mince Pie. 

Three pounds of beef, one fresh beef's tongue, four (or six) 
pounds of suet, three and a half pounds of raisins, three pounds

of chopped apples, four and a half pounds of sugar, three 
pints of molasses, three ounces of cinnamon, two ounces of 
cloves, a nutmeg, one teacupful of the Mace Compound, one 
and a fourth ounces of salt, half an ounce of pepper, one gal- 
lon and a half of sweet cider. When mixed, put into a kettle 
and scald, stirring it all the time. Put it hot into Hero or 
Mason jars — two quarts or gallon jars — and the longer you 
keep it the nicer it will be. 

251 Mince Pie. 

Seven pounds of meat, six pounds of suet, seven pounds of 
sugar, one gallon and a half of boiled cider, seven pounds of 
currants, seven pounds of seeded raisins, fourteen pounds of

chopped apples. Boil together cider, apples and sugar, and 
when h(jt pour over the otlier ingredients ; add one teacup of 
Mace Compound, nutmeg and cinnamon to taste. If citron is 
liked, put in slices just before baking ; the vinegar from 
pickled peaches is a nice addition — to this quantity use one 
pint. 

252 Plain Mince Meat. 

One pint bowl of meat and one of suet, chopped fine ; two 
bowls of apples; one of boiled cider; one and one-half cups of 
molasses ; one bowl of sugar ; one teaspoon of cloves ; two of 
cinnamon ; two of allspice and one nutmeg. Let the mixture 
come to a boil. 

253 Summer Mince Pies. 

We do not recommend this, preferring fruit pies in summer, 
but the receipt is highly recommended. Two cups of dried

255 Lemon Pie that will Keep a Long Time, No. 1. 

One pound of sugar, half a pound of butter, eight eggs, the 
rind of two lemons, the juice of one; beat well and bake with 
an under crust in an oven not too hot, as it needs thorough 
baking, and must not have a soft or custard look when done. 
This recipe will make two pies, which, if not eaten fresh, will 
be equally good a week after with a fresh meringue and 
browned in the oven, and is recommended by a first rate 
housekeeper. 

256 A Substitute for Corn Starch. 

Grate a large cooked potato, or its equivalent in small 
ones, as a substitute for corn starch in a lemon pie, or sprinkle 
flour over it enough to thicken it a little. Some use raw 
potatoes, but I prefer cooked. Try it, if you have a good 
recipe ; you will think your pies are delicious. 

257 Lemon Pie, No. 2. (Very Fine.) 

Grate the rind and squeeze the juice of two lemons ; beat 
the yolks of three eggs with eight tablespoon fuls of coffee 
sugar, half a cup of water and two tablespoonfuls of flour ; 
stir the flour into the well beaten yolks and sugar, then add 
water, juice and rind ; bake with an under crust ; have ready 
when it comes from the oven, the whites, beaten to a stiff 
froth, with four tablespoonfuls of pulverized sugar ; put on, set 
in oven, and brown as quickly as possible, to avoid its being 
leathery. 

I should like to add, for the benefit of many housekeepers 
who do not know that a meringue should always be put on 
while the pudding or pie is hot, and browned as quickly as 
possible ; if put cold, it is apt to go back and taste of raw egg, 
unless kept in the oven long enough to make it leathery.

PUDDINGS. 



In these days, when puddings are always " steamed in a 
mold," the temperature of the water is not a matter of such 
vital importance. We confess to being old-fashioned enough 
to prefer a pudding boiled in a bag. Take a half a yard of 
nice, new " Russia Duck," or strong, unbleached drilling, or 
sail cloth, sew together so as to form a sausage ; turn it inside 
out, dip it in boiling water, and rub it into a pan of flour, 
turn the bag so that the flour is on the inside, tie up one end 
tightly, and pour the pudding into the other, leave room for 
it to swell; tie the other end. Put a plate in your pot, have 
the water boiling, and keep it boiling for three hours after 
you have plnnged your pudding in. The flavor of a bag 
pudding is greatly superior to that of a mold. 

Baking a pudding is a more simple process, but let us warn 
our students not to bake it to death. A bread or any custard 
pudding should shake in the middle when it is done. A rice 
pudding should be lightly baked ; an Indian meal pudding- 
will bear much longer baking. The boiled lemon pudding 
given at No. 304 requires a mold as it is so delicate. 



287 Mace Compound. 

To take the place of "sherry wine" in puddings and 
sauces. Soak half an ounce of mace eight hours in one tea- 
cup of lemon juice, add half a teacup of boiling water and 
scald twenty minutes.

370 Pried Cream (Creme Prite). 

Every one should try this recipe. It will surprise many to 
know how soft cream could be enveloped in the crust; it is 
an exceedingly good dish for a dinner course, or for lunch 
or tea. When the pudding is hard it can be rolled in the 
egg and bread crumbs. The moment the egg touches the hot 
lard, it hardens and secures the pudding, which softens to a 
creamy substance, very delicious. 

Ingredients : One pint of milk, five ounces of sugar (little 
more than half a cupful), butter the size of a hickory nut, 
yolks of three eggs, two tablespoonfuls of corn starch, and 
one tablespoonful of flour (a generous half cupful altogether), 
stick of cinnamon one inch long, one-half teaspoonful of 
vanilla. Put the cinnamon into the milk, and when it is just 
about to boil, stir in the sugar, the corn starch, and flour, the 
two latter rubbed smooth, with two or three tablespoonfuls of 
extra cold milk ; stir it over the fire for fully two minutes, to 
cook well the starch and flour ; take it from the fire, stir into 
it the beaten yolks of the eggs, and return it for a few moments 
to set them ; now, again taking it from the fire, remove the 
Cinnamon, stir in the butter and vanilla, and pour it on a but- 
tered platter until one-third of an inch high. When cold 
and stiff, cut the pudding into parallelograms, about three 
inches long, and two inches wide ; roll these carefully, first in 
sifted cracker crumbs, then in eggs (slightly beaten and 



132 FRIED CREAM, BATTER PUDDINGS, FRITTERS. 

sweetened), then again in the cracker crumbs. Dip these into 
boiling hot lard (a wire basket should be used if convenient),, 
and when of fine color take them out and place them in the^ 
oven for four or five minutes to better soften the pudding. 
Sprinkle over pulverized sugar, and serve immediately. 

371 White Puffs, Very Nice.

salt. Whisk the eggs and sugar to a meringue and add this- 
alternately with the milk, cream or half cream — half milk is- 
better, if you have it ; beat until the mixture is very light,, 
and bake in buttered cups or tins. Turn out, sift powdered 
sugar over them, and eat with lemon sauce, or sauce flavored 
with lemon. These are delicate in taste and texture, and 
pleasant to the eye,

ter and flour together. After the batter is cold, stir in the 
yolks of eight eggs, and just before baking the whites beaten 
light. Bake in a quick oven. Eat with sauce. 



FRIED CREAM, BATTER PUDDINGS, FRITTERS. 185 

384 Kissingen Phanneknchen. 

One cup of flour, one pint of milk, one tablespoonful of 
sugar, piece of butter the size of a walnut (a heaping tea- 
spoonful) ; scald the milk, butter and flour together. After 
the batter is cold stir in the yolks of eight eggs, and just before 
cooking add the whites beaten very light. Put into a frying 
or omelet pan a tablespoonful of butter ; let it boil up, pour in 
one-sixth of this mixture, and let it fry as you do an omelet ; 
fold over from each side of the pan and double in the middle, 
as you do an omelet. In Germany they sprinkle sugar over 
before folding up. We prefer sifting the powdered sugar on 
after it is folded. Raspberry jam is served with phan- 
neknchen. We prefer it without. 



136 HOME-MADE EXTRACTS. 



HOME-MADE EXTRACTS. 



385 Almond Flavor. 

Pound six bitter and twelve sweet almonds in a mortar, and 
add to pudding sauce, or add wath this a teaspoonf ul of extract 
nectarine. 



386 Mace Compound. 

One teacup of lemon juice, one-half ounce of blade mace; 
let steep six hours, then add half a teacup of water and let 
it scald fifteen or twenty minutes ; bottle and seal for use as 
directed. 



387 Bitter Almond Plavoring. 

From May till November three or four peach leaves scalded 
in milk make a delicious flavoring for cake, custard and ice 
cream. 



388 Extract of Lemon. 

Grate or pare very thin the rinds of lemons to be used for 
lemonade; put them into a pint jar and pour proof spirits on. 
The proportion should be eight tablespoonfuls of grated peel 
to ten of proof spirits. 



HOME-MADE EXTRACTS. 137 

389 Essence of Orange. 

Make as lemon, only using four tablespoonfuls of the grated 
rind to ten tablespoonfuls of rectified spirits. 

890 Essence of Ginger and Vanilla. 

We prefer to use Brown's Jamaica Ginger (Philadelphia 
maker), and Burnet's Extract of Vanilla. 

391 Pickled Peach Vinegar 

Is often a pleasant ilavor to molasses or other sauces. 



1,'^8 MERINGUES. 



MERINGUES. 



These have become an every-day addition to pastries, 
custards, and even charlottes. We therefore give two receipts 
for French and Italian meringues, as well as those inter- 
spersed throughout other receipts. 

392 To Make a French Meringue. 

To each white of an egg, beaten stiif as possible, take two heap- 
ing tablespoonfuls of pulverized sugar, sift it lightly and slowly 
mto the whites, stirring till smooth ; spread over your pie, 
pudding or fruit ; sift a very trifle of sugar over the top and 
bake quickly. If the oven browns too fast shade the meringue 
with a paper that does not touch it. 

,'593 Italian Meringues. 

Boil four ounces of sugar slowly and steadily with two 
tablespoonfuls of water till it begins to crystallize, which can 
be told by its forming long threads as you give the skimmer 
a sudden jerk ; then pour this onto the whites of two eggs, 
beaten to a very stiff froth, and stir for five or ten minutes off 
the fire ; sprinkle the top with split and blanched almonds, 
and bake as you do French meringues. 



CUSTARDS. 139 



CUSTARDS. 



( General Directions.) 

Eggs, milk and sugar of the best ; a custard boiler or a tin 
pail set in a kettle of boiling water will answer the purpose, 
for boiled custards ; bring the milk to a boil, stir your yolks 
of eggs and sugar together ; pour a teacup of scalding milk on 
the eggs and sugar, blend all smoothly and then stir them into 
your scalding milk and keep your spoon moving around the 
boiler for a miqute or a minute and a half, by the cloek, 
till the custard begins to thicken ; take quickly from the fire 
and continue to stir for a few moments after it has been 
removed. Never add flavoring till the custard is almost cold. 

Baking custard can be accomplished by simply setting* the 
pan containing the ingredients in the oven and baking twenty 
minutes ; but a method that gives a more delicate flavor is to 
cover your pudding dish or pan, set it in another larger pan, 
and two-thirds fill the latter with boiling water and let it 
bake till the center is like jelly. 

As the foundation of most creams is a well made boiled 
custard, and the main element of most puddings is " a baked 
custard with additions," it behooves every one desirous of being 
a dainty cook to make a study of custards. 

304 Delicate Custard. 

Heat a quart of milk quite hot, that it may not whey when 
boiled, let it stand till cold; then beat six eggs very light (five 
Avill do very well), and add to the milk ; sw^eeten to taste with 



140 CUSTARDS. 

white sugar, flavor with lemon or vanilla, and a pinch of salt. 
Fill cups or bowls and set them in the oven in a dripping-pan 
filled with boiling water. When the water has boiled ten or 
fifteen minutes, take out a cup, and if the cup is the consis- 
tency of jelly, it is done. Cover the cups and they will bake 
better. 

•395 Boiled Custard. 

One quart of boiling milk, to which add the yolks of eight 
eggs and one heaping teacup of sugar, stir just one minute 
before taking off the fire ; this is the genuine old-fashioned 
boiled custard ; when cold, flavor with vanilla or bitter almonds 
or use no flavoring, but after it is poured into the cups grate a 
little nutmeg over each. 

396 Boiled Custard, No. 2. 

Bring two quarts of milk to a boil, stir into them two even 
tablespoonfuls of corn starch and let cook till smooth and well 
done ; add yolks of three eggs beaten very light ; stir well for 
one minute by the clock ; now stir in lightly the whites of 
four eggs beaten to a stiff froth, allowing it half a minute 
more over the fire to set the eggs. Flavor with vanilla or 
chocolate, or both. This is a particularly nice custard, and 
though it is comparatively inexpensive, it does not taste cheap. 

397 Caramel Custard Pudding. 

One small teacupful of brown sugar in a Charlotte Russe 
pan, in which it is to be baked, set in the oven five minutes or 
longer ; prepare a custard of four eggs to one quart of milk 
and one heaping teacup of sugar; pour this gently into the 
pan and bake promptly. 



CUSTAEDS. 141 

398 Lemon Custards that will keep a week. 

Beat the yolks of eight eggs until they are white, theu put 
to them a pint of boiling water, the rinds of two lemons 
grated, and the juice sweetened to your taste, stir it on the fire 
until it is thick, then add almond or nectarine flavoring, and 
after giving it one scald, put in cups to eat cold. 

If it does not come thick enough a little corn starch can be 
added. 

399 Custard to Turn Out. 

Mix with the yolks of four eggs, well beaten, one pint of 
new milk, sweetened with sugar, and boil over the fire till it 
thickens ; then add half a box of gelatine, previously dissolved 
by soaking one hour in half a teacup of cold water, then add- 
ing two tablespoon fuls of boiling water, and set it over the 
steam of the teakettle till needed. Pour into a dish and stir till 
a little cooler, then pour into cups to turn out when cold. 
•Add flavoring to the eggs. 

400 Chocolate Custard. 

One quart milk, three tablespoons grated chocolate boiled 
in the milk, three eggs beaten light, stirred into the boiling 
milk ; let the whole come to a boil again. Sweeten to ta^jte. 

401 Cocoanut Custard. • 

To one pound of grated cocoanut allow one pint of scalding 
milk and six ounces of sugar. Beat well the yolks of six 
eggs and stir them alternately in the milk with the cocoanut 
and sugar. Pour this into a dish lined with paste and bake 
twenty minutes, or, if preferred, treat the milk, cocoanut, 
eggs and sugar as for boiled custard and serve in cups. 



142 CUSTARDS. 

402 Snow Custard (Winter Receipt). 

For a three-pint mold put one-half box of gelatine in a 
bowl, soak it one hour with one pint of cold water, then add 
, one pint of boiling water, stir until dissolved; then put to 
cool ; sweeten with three-quarters of a pound of sugar and 
flavor with the juice of three lemons. Whip the whites of 
four eggs to a stiff froth ; add them to the gelatine when it 
begins to stiffen or set ; then whip the whole to a light froth, 
and when all begins to stiffen pour it into a mold. Take the 
four yolks of the eggs and make a rich custard, flavor it with 
the rind of one lemon and pour round. This pudding will 
keep for a day or tw^o. This receipt is excellent in cold 
weather or where you can use plenty of ice. 

403 Snow Custard (Summer Receipt). 

Soak one-half a box of gelatine one hour in half a pint of 
cold water ; add half a pint of boiling water, three-quarters of 
a pound of powdered sugar. Beat the whites of three eggs, 
add gradually the gelatine and sugar, when it begins to set 
then the juice of three lemons, grated rind of one; beat con- 
stantly, hard and/as^, from half an hour to an hour, or until 
it is about as stiff" as pancake batter; put it in the dish in which 
it is to be served, and set in a cold place or on ice ; make the 
yolks into a soft custard, with a pint of milk, flavoring with the 
rind of the lemon. This pudding is good the second day, 
eaten with strawberries or canned fruit. 



CKILVM.S. 143 



CREAMS. 



In most Creams a well made custard is the basis of their 
composition. This is also somewhat the case in Charlotte 
Russe. Nothing is more simple than to make a smooth, rich 
boiled custard, and we refer our readers to the " general 
instructions for making custards," which precede the foregoing 
subject. The second thing in creams is the proper preparation 
of gelatine or isinglass. All gelatine or isinglass melts more 
smoothly and richly if soaked at least one hour in cold water, 
a scant teacup of water to an ounce of either. When all the 
water is absorbed, and the gelatine soft, add from two to four 
tablespoonfuls of boiling water, and set it on the back of the 
stove to melt. When it is a smooth glue stir it into your cus- 
tard. Plan to have the gelatine ready to pour into the cus- 
tard within five minutes after you remove both from the fire, 
and stir till it is so smoothly mixed with the custard as to be 
a part of it. The second and most important matter is just when 
to combine the custard, or simple gelatioe, with the whipped 
cream. Your custard with the gelatine, or the latter properly 
dissolved, must be exactly at the point where it is ready to set. 
You can easily tell this by the manner in which it begins to 
adhere to the bottom and sides of the bowl or pan. If the 
gelatine is not cold enough, and your cream is almost whipped, 
take a piece of ice as large as your two hands, fold it in an 
old cloth and beat it with a hammer or flat-iron till very fine ; 
open the cloth, stir a teacup of salt in the ice; pour it quickly 
into a pan, and set the lukewarm custard or gelatine upon 
it, stirring and beating till cold ; then the cream and custard 



144 . CREAMS. 

can be blended quickly, but thoroughly. By neglecting these 
precautions, we have seen the most disheartening failure of 
the very best receipts ; the mortified cook all the time protest- 
ing that she had done just what the book said. If you wish, 
to make a charlotte or cream directly after breakfast, when 
you rise in the morning drop your gelatine into a tumbler, 
and cover it with the cold water ; have your milk put on the 
stove to boil while you are breakfasting. When you go into 
the kitchen add the boiling water to the gelatine, and set it 
to melt ; break you eggs, add your sugar, et cetera, and in five 
minutes your custard is made. While it is cooling whip your 
cream, and in twenty-five minutes, if your plans are well 
arranged, you have made an elaborate dessert ; and its prepar- 
ation has been a pleasure rather than a toil. 

Let us reiterate that the temperature in the combination of 
custard, cream and gelatine is the secret of success. Cold 
cream to whip, cold eggs to beat, cool custard to stir into the 
cream, will encourage you to believe that the art of cookery 
is yours. 

, Notwithstanding the best cookery books instruct you to 
** soak the gelatine in milk," and " boil the gelatine in milk," 
we can from our own experience give the advice of Punch to 
the young man about to marry, " Don't." 

Gelatine and milk, either soaked or boiled, are very apt to 
curdle. In receipts for Spanish cream this boiling gelatine in 
milk and adding eggs afterwards, is always strongly urged. 
Our own plan is to boil the milk, scald the yolks of eggs and 
sugar in the same. Take them off the fire and cool five min- 
lutes ; then stir in the gelatine which has been warmed, till it 
is a smooth liquid. Set away to cool, and when cold and just 
ready to set, stir in the well beaten whites. 



CREAMS. 145 

404 Charlotte Russe, No. 1. 

Sweeten and flavor to taste one quart of fresh cream ; whip 
it to a froth with a Dover egg-beater or wire spoon. Break 
up half an ounce of Cooper's isinglass into half a pint of cold 
water ; let soak one hour, then set it over a boiling teakettle, 
or on the stove, to dissolve. When thoroughly dissolved and 
cooled, pour it into the cream, stirring it until it begins to 
thicken. Line a mold with lady's-fingers and pour in the 
mixture. 

405 Charlotte Eusse, No. 2. 

Four sheets of Cooper's isinglass broken up and soaked in 
cold water till soft, then pour off" the water and put the isin- 
glass into half a pint of boiling water; set it on the stove to 
stew down to one-half. Beat the yolks of four eggs till very 
light, with three-quarters of a pound of sugar ; stir these into 
one pint of boiling milk. Beat the whites separately ; strain 
the isinglass into this custard as it cools and begins to stiffen ; 
whip in the whites, flavor with two teaspoons of vanilla. 
Have ready a quart of cream churned to a froth, which add 
when the custard is quite cold and commencing to thicken, 
stir very thoroughly, but quickly, and put into molds lined 
with sponge cake. 

406 Charlotte Russe (Katie T.'s), No. 3. 

Beat one pint of cream ^till thick and foamy; beat the 
whites of four eggs to a very stiff froth, soak two tablespoon- 
fuls of gelatine in two tablespoonfuls of cold water one hour ; 
then add two tablespoonfuls of boiling water ; let it cool, then 
put a scant teacup of pulverized sugar into a large bowl, add 
two teaspoonfuls of extract of vanilla ; pour the eggs, cream, 
10 



146 CREAMS. 

and last the gelatine, all into this bowl, and beat with an egg- 
beater till well blended. Pour this mixture into Charlotte 
molds, lined with lady's-fingers, and put it away on ice for 
three or four hours to set. This is very pretty, made in a 
glass bowl, with lady's-fingers at the bottom and sides, and two 
crossed on the tops. In summer double the quantity of gela- 
tine if you wish it to turn out on a dish. 

407 Charlotte Eusse. 

Three pints good cream, three-fourths of a pound pulver- 
ized sugar, one ounce of best gelatine, six eggs. Divide the 
sugar in half, sweeten the cream with one-half, flavor with 
Burnet's extract of vanilla, and whip with a Dover egg-beater. 
Beat the eggs to a stiff' froth, add the rest of the sugar, beat- 
ing hard. As soon as the gelatine is weighed, put it into half 
a teacup of cold water to soak one or two hours ; then add 
half a teacup of boiling water, melt and strain, and keep warm. 
Put the eggs and sugar into a large bowl, pour over the scald- 
ing gelatine ; stir well and quickly, and when it is well cooled, 
add the whipped cream, mixing with both hands and with great 
dispatch to avoid congealing in lumps. Pour in glass bowls 
and ornament to suit the taste. If this receipt is closely fol- 
lowed, one need never fail in making this delicious dessert. 

408 A Charlotte a la Parisienne. 

One large stale sponge cake, one cup of rich custard, one 
cup of sweet cream whipped, two tablespoonfuls of rose 
water, one-half of a grated cocoanut, one-half pound of sweet 
almonds blanched and pounded, whites of four eggs beaten 
stiff", three tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar. 

Cut the cake in horizontal slices the whole length of the 
loaf. They should be half an inch thick. Divide the whipped 



CREAMS. 147 

egg into two portions ; into one stir the cocoanut with half 
the sugar ; into the other the almond paste, with the rest of 
the sugar. Spread the slices with these mixtures, half with 
the cocoanut, and half with the almond, and replace them in 
their original form, laying aside the top crust for a lid. Press 
all the sliced cake firmly together, that the slices may not 
slip, and with a sharp knife cut a deep cut out of the center 
down to the bottom slice, which must be left entire. Take 
out the rounds you have cut, leaving the walls an inch thick, 
and soak the part removed in a bowl with the custard. Rub 
it to a smooth batter, and whip it into the whipped cream, the 
rose water in the almond paste will flavor it sufiiciently. 
When it is a rich stiff cream, fill the cavity of the cake with 
it ; put on the lid and then ice with the following : Whites 
of three eggs, one heaping cup of j)owdered sugar, juice of 
one lemon. Beat stiff, and cover the sides and top of the 
cake ; set in a very cold place until needed. This is a delicious 
and elegant charlotte, which twenty-five years ago was called 
*' a Charlotte Polonaise." 



409 Bavarian Cream. 

Take half a box of Nelson's or Cox's gelatine, pour over it 
half a teacup of cold water, let it soak one hour or more, then 
add two tablespoonfuls of boiling water and set the tin cup in 
which it is on the back part of the stove to thoroughly dis- 
solve. Put a pint of rich milk or cream in your custard 
pail ; let it come to a boil, add two heaping, tablespoonfuls 
of pulverized sugar and the yolks of four eggs stirred 
together; beat and stir one moment over the fire; take off 
and pour into a bowl to cool, adding the half ounce of 
gelatine ; then take one pint of very cold sweet cream, add 
to it one teaspoonful of extract of vanilla (Burnet's) and two 



148 CREAMS. 

heaping tablespoonfuls of pulverized sugar. Whip it to a 
froth, skim off the whipped cream and place it in a sieve to 
drain ; whip and skim till it is all frothed. If by this time- 
your custard is cold enough to begin to set, stir cream and^ 
custard rapidly together ; if not thoroughly cooled set it on 
some ice broken up fine, and having half a teacup or more of 
salt sprinkled among it ; the moment it begins to set stir 
quickly but delicately together the custard and whipped 
cream till well mixed ; pour into a mold and set on ice or in a 
very cold place. 

410 Mrs. Henderson's Bavarian Cream. 

Sweeten with two heaping tablespoonfuls of sugar, and whip 
one pint of cream to a stiff froth, laying it on a sieve to drain. 

Boil another pint of cream or rich milk with two heaping 
tablespoonfuls of sugar ; take it off the fire and add half a box 
of Nelson's or Cox's gelatine (soaked for an hour in half a cup- 
ful of cold water in a warm place near the range ; then add two 
tablespoonfuls boiling water and set over the steam of the 
teakettle till dissolved); when slightly cooled, stir in the yolks 
of four eggs well beaten ; when it has become quite cold and 
begins to thicken stir it without ceasing a few minutes until it 
is very smooth, then stir in the whipped cream lightly until it 
is well mixed. Put it into a mold or molds and set it on the 
ice or in a cool place. We prefer the preceding receipt, but 
as the effect is somewhat different, we give both as both are 
excellent. 

411 Chocolate Bavarian Cream 

Can be made as the preceding by adding two sticks of 
chocolate (soaked and stirred smooth in two tablespoonfuls of 
water) to the yolks of the eggs. 



CREAMS. 149 

413 Almond Bavarian Cream. 

Take three ounces of sweet and one of bitter almonds, 
blanch and skin them ; put them into a pan on a moderate 
fire, stirring them continually. As soon as they have acquired 
a, fine yellow color, take them off the fire, and when cold 
pound them into fine pieces ; then add a pint of cream or rich 
milk nearly boiling and three or four heaping tablespoon fu Is 
of sugar and half a package of gelatine, which has been 
soaked as before described. Put it upon the ice and when 
about to thicken stir it until it is very smooth ; then stir in 
lightly a pint of cream whipped and put it into a mold. 



413 Riz de llmperatrice (Queen's Eice). 

A large spoonful of rice, whitened in cold water ; then put 
the rice in just enough milk to cook the rice properly. Take 
the yolks of four eggs and a cup of sugar, with a pint of milk, 
and cook like a custard. Mix the rice with the custard and 
set on the ice an hour and a half before dinner ; ad^ a pint of 
whipped cream and one-third of a box of gelatine and pour in 
a mold ; before turning out of the mold, put some preserves in 
the bottom of the dish, and garnish the top with preserved 
cherries. 



414 Bavaroise. 

A full pint of milk, four tablespoonfuls of ground coffee ; 
cooked until well mixed, and strained through a jelly bag ; 
add the yolks of four eggs, a cup of sugar and cook as for 
a custard ; set in the cold an hour and a half before dinner ; 
add a pint of whipped cream, and gelatine one-half or a third 
of a box, the same amount as for Charlotte Russe. 



1 50 CREAMS. 

415 Genoese Cream. 

One pint of milk, one tablespoonfal of flour, one tablespoon- 
fiil of sugar. Boil until it thickens ; add the yolks of three 
eggs and a piece of butter the size of an egg ; flavor with lemon 
or vanilla. Cover the bottom of the dish with sponge cake 
spreading one side of cake with currant or other jelly. Pour 
on the cream and dust the top with sugar. 

416 Spanish Cream. 

Dissolve half a package of Cox's gelatine in half a pint of 
cold milk. Simmer a quart of milk ; while hot on the stove 
pour in the gelatine, stirring till perfectly dissolved ; add the 
beaten yolks of eight eggs, sugar and vanilla, as for a custard, 
and let them scald one minute or a little more. When done 
pour the mixture into a large dish containing the well beaten 
whites of the eight eggs ; stir briskly for one minute and pour 
into molds. It will fill two quarts and one pint. Our expe- 
rience leads us to say that if milkman's milk and cream is 
used it is better not to soak the gelatine in milk, but water. 

417 Italian Cream. 

Mix one pint of rich cream with half a pint of milk, sweeten 
to taste ; add one teaspoon extract of bitter almond, one gill 
of rose water. Beat these thoroughly together. Take one 
ounce of isinglass, break it small into a very little water and 
set it over a boiling teakettle until dissolved ; strain and stir 
into the cream. Fill the molds and set in a cool place. 

418 Eussian Cream. 

One-half box of gelatine, cover it with cold water and let it 
stand one hour. Beat the yolks of four eggs and one cup of 



CREAMS. 151 

powdered sugar together ; stir in the gelatine and pour all into 
one quart of boiling milk. Flavor with vanilla. Let it cool 
and then stir it into the whites of the eggs beaten to a stiff 
froth ; pour into molds and let it stand four hours, w^hen it 
will be ready to use. 

419 Blanc-Mange. 

This is an old-fashioned receipt, but after one has been 
cloyed on whipped cream old-time blanc-mange will produce 
quite a new sensation. 

Take four ounces of sweet almonds, blanched, half an ounce 
of bitter almonds ; pound them in a wedgewood mortar, 
moistening them gradually with orange flower water ; mix 
this with one quart of fresh cream. Have the " largest half " 
of a box of Cox's gelatine soaking in half a cup of cold water 
one hour. Set your cream and almonds on the fire, stirring 
constantly ; when it comes to a scald pour in the gelatine and 
stir till it dissolves. Put in molds. 

420 Cream a la Mode. 

Put half a pound of white sugar into a deep glass dish ; the 
juice of one large orange and one lemon ; to one ounce of isin- 
glass add one pint of water ; let it simmer down one-half, and 
when cool and beginning to set strain it on the above, and by 
degrees add one and a half pints of cream, that have been 
well whipped; stir till cool and place in on ice to stiffen. 

421 Tapioca Cream. 

One cup of tapioca ; add to it sufficient milk to make it soft, 
and soak eight hours ; then take one quart of milk, let it boil 
for a few minutes ; beat two eggs, whites and yolks separately, 
stir the yolks into the milk, and, when it begins to boil, add 
the tapioca ; let it boil up, then stir the whites very thoroughly 
through it. Flavor to taste; eat cold. 



152 CKEAMS. 

432 Peach Meringue. 

Cut up peaches, and put in the bottom of a dish ; sprinkle 
them with sugar. Make an icing of the whites of three eggs 
and three-fourths of a cup of sugar, spread over the peaches 
and bake a few minutes. 

423 Orange Soufle. 

Two oranges peeled and cut in thin slices in your pudding 
dish, with sugar sprinkled over them, and let stand an hour. 
Make a custard with the yolks of four eggs and one pint of 
milk, sweetened to taste, pour over the oranges boiling hot. 
Beat the whites to a stiff froth with five tablespoonfuls of pul- 
verized sugar, spread over the top of the custard, set the 
dish in a pan of water and put in the oven until it is a lovely 
brown. 

424 Fruit Charlotte. 

Line a dish with sponge cake, place upon the bottom, in the 
center of the dish, grated pine-apple; cover with a whipped 
cream blanc-mange. Keep back a little of the cream to pour 
over the top after it is turned out of the mold. 



ICE CREAMS. 153 



ICE CREAMS. 



We have lived so much in the country that years ago we 
gave our mind to the simplification of making ice cream. 
We like a patent freezer ; almost all are good, especially those 
that have not too much machinery, but we can make mighty 
good cream with a tall four-quart tin pail and an ordinary 
wooden bucket. Any of the receipts given are good. All 
cream is the richest — the flour, milk and whites of eggs with 
part cream is the next — the frozen custard is thoroughly 
digestible and an excellent and economical receipt. To 
freeze ice cream or water ices quickly and well : Have your 
cream or custard on the ice for two or three hours before you 
are ready to use it ; flavor and sweeten the former when you 
are prepared to freeze it. Take a fifteen pound lump of ice, 
put it into an old bag or coffee sack, have at your hand 
three pints of course salt ; then take the flat of the axe or a 
mallet, or, if you have neither, and area woman, a great deal 
may be accomplished with a flat-iron, pound the ice fine, 
empty it oiut of the bag into an old dishpan or tub, pour over 
the salt, take your shf)rt-handled stove shovel or a scoop, mix 
all thoroughly and fill round the ice cream freezer after it has 
been properly placed in the tub ; then pour in your cream. 

425 Ice Cream. 

To one quart of cream take six ounces of sugar, grate in one- 
quarter of a vanilla bean, strain it and put it into your 
freezer ; add the whites of two eggs beaten very light, with 
three tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar to stiffen them. If 



154 ICE CREAMS. 

your cream is not very rich, boil a little milk, sweeten it, beat 
two eggs very light and stir in and cook like soft custard. 
The flavor will perhaps be better if the vanilla bean is boiled 
a few minutes in a little milk, which may be added to the 
cream when cool. 

426 Ice Cream. 

Three pints sweet cream, one quart of new milk, one pint 
of powdered sugar ; put in a freezer till thoroughly chilled 
through, then add the'Jwhites of two eggs beaten light, and 
freeze. 

427 Ice Cream, No. 2. 

Boil two quarts of milk, into which stir a pint of cold milk 
that has had four level tablespoonfuls of arrowroot mixed 
smoothly into it, then scald, but not boil ; when cold, add two 
quarts of cream, a tablespoon ful of vanilla or other flavoring, 
and two pounds (or pints) of sugar ; put in the freezer and 
whip till well chilled, then add the whites of six eggs beaten 
to a stifl" froth. 

428 "White Ice Cream. 

Three quarts of milk, whites of four eggs, beaten light, 
three tablespoonfuls of arrowroot mixed in a little cold water 
and added to the eggs. Boil the milk and pour over the eggs, 
then set over the fire and stir till it thickens a little ; when 
nearly cold, add a quart of cream, sweeten and flavor to the 
taste. We allow a cupful of sugar and a teaspoonful of 
vanilla, Burnet's extract, to every quart. If you have no 
arrowroot, use half a teacup of flour, let it boil well, and then 
strain well. 



ICE CREAMS. 155 

429 Caramel Ice Cream. 

Take two pints of browu sugar, put it in an iron skillet 
over a brisk fire-until it is dissolved, stirring it constantly to 
prevent its burning ; have a pint of milk at boiling point and 
stir a little of this at a time into the sugar, as it shows a dis- 
position to scorch. Strain it and when cool add it to three 
quarts of pure cream well beaten in the freezer, and freeze. 

430 Norvell House Caramel Ice Cream. 

Four quarts of pure cream, four heaping cups of powdered 
sugar, five tablespoonfuls of caramel ; mix and freeze hard. 

431 Caramel Custard Ice Cream. 

Make two quarts of rich boiled custard, substituting for 
sugar one pint of brown sugar, treated as in caramel ice 
cream No. 1 ; freeze. 

432 Biscuit Glace. 

To half a pound of powdered sugar add the yolks of four 
eggs and vanilla flavor ; beat w^ell and then take two quarts 
of well whipped cream, and mix with sugar and yolks; color 
some of it red and spread on the bottom of paper cupsules and 
fill up with the fresh cream. Then put them in a tin box 
with cover and pack well up on all sides with pounded ice 
and salt. Let stand for two hours ; it is then ready for use. 

The above receipt was procured from the French cook at 
the St. Nicholas Hotel, New York, where biscuits glace 
reach a perfection that cannot be excelled by any confectioner. 



156 ICE CREAMS. 

433 Chocolate Ice. 

Grate two cakes of chocolate, and mix to a paste with milk. 
Boil one quart of milk and when boiling, add the chocolate 
with sugar enough to make it very sweet. When cool and 
ready for the freezer, pour in a teaspoonful of vanilla, and 
freeze as ice cream. 



434 Bisque. 

One-half gallon of freshly turned bonny clabber or milk 
that has soured and set, one-half gallon of rich sweet cream, a 
vanilla bean boiled in a half pint of sweet milk ; sweeten. 
Churn five minutes before freezing. One can of condensed 
milk can be used with less clabber. This is a Virginia 
receipt, our ow^n is somewhat similar, except that six hours 
before making the bisque we take two quarts of fresh milk 
add to it a scant teacup of sugar, a teaspoonful of vanilla, and 
set it by, stirring in two scant teaspoonfuls of liquid rennet 
prepared by Wyth, of Philadelphia. 

435 Chocolate Ice. 

Follow the receipt No. 10 for German chocolate, add a 
scant teacup of sugar for each receipt (or quart) made ; let it 
become thoroughly cold and freeze as ice cream. 



WATER ICES. 157 



WATER ICES. 



436 Water Ices. 

We wish to say a word on the subject of water ices. If 
you desire them to freeze promptly and be rich and smooth, 
be careful to obey these directions : 

Know what quantity you need for your freezer, and make 
your calculations accordingly. Take the requisite amount of 
water and sugar, and let them boil till they form a rich syrup ; 
it will take an hour if made with boiling water, and longer 
if with cold water. Then set it away to get thoroughly cold ; 
add to this your lemon juice, pine-apple, orange, raspberry, 
currant, etc. Allow the whites of three eggs to every two 
quarts of the mixture ; whip them very light, and when the 
ice has been frozen till it is just ready to stiffen, stir in the 
whites of the eggs. 



437 Lemon Ice. 

Take the juice of four lemons, add about three pints of 
thin syrup made with about one pint of sugar. Into every 
quart when it begins to freeze, stir the whites of two eggs 
beaten very light, with a little powdered sugar. This will 
make it smooth. 

Any kind of water ice may be made in this way, by mixing 
the strained juice of the fruit, currant, raspberry, strawberry, 
etc., with syrup flavored to taste, and add the white of an egg 
when it begins to freeze. 



158 WATER ICES. 

438 Pine-Apple Ice. 

Two juicy ripe pine-apples, peeled and cut small ; juice and 
grated peel of two lemons, two pints sugar made into syrup 
with two pints of water. Strew some sugar over the pine- 
apple and lemon juice, and let it stand an hour or more ; 
mash all up together and strain out the syrup through a bag ; 
add the boiled syrup and freeze. 

439 Pine-Apple Ice, Uo. 2. 

One pine-apple cut fine, one pound sugar made into syrup, 
with one pint of boiling water. Let the mixture stand six 
hours, then strain and add one quart thin syrup, whites of 
three eggs and juice of one lemon. Freeze. 

440 Iced Coffee. 

One pint of strong coffee ; one pint of rich cream ; one-half 
a pound of sugar ; then freeze. 

441 TuttiPrutti. 

When a rich vanilla cream is partly frozen, candied cher- 
ries, chopped raisins, chopped citron, or any other candied 
fruit choj^ped rather fine, are added; add about half the quan- 
tity of fruit that there is of ice cream ; mold and imbed in 
ice and salt. 

442 Currant Ice . 

Is a very nice and pretty country dessert. Make a syrup of 
one quart of water and one pint of sugar ; let it boil down ; 
skim, and when cold add a pint of currant juice. When 
partly frozen stir in the beaten whites of three eggs and a 
teaspoonfiil of extract of nutmeg. 



WATER ICES. 159 

443 Peach Frozen. 

Cut up peaches and put in the bottom of a dish ; sprinkle 
them with sugar. Make an icing of the whites of three eggs 
and three-fourths of a cup of sugar, spread over the peaches 
and set on ice and salt to freeze ; when partly frozen, you may 
add whipped cream instead of icing. 

444 Orange Ice. 

Cut and sugar well six oranges, press them through a coarse 
sieve, add the juice of two lemons and three tablespoonfuls of 
gelatine soaked and stewed till smooth ; pour this into a quart 
of rich boiled syrup, made as in receipt No. 436 ; freeze; or you 
may omit the gelatine and substitute the whites of two eggs. 



160 FROSTING. 



FROSTING. 



If made properly will prove " sure every time." The 
secret in boiling frosting lies in knowing just when to take it 
off the stove. 

445 Frosting. 

To one cup of sugar I take the white of one egg, just cover 
the sugar with water and let it boil without stirring till it 
ropes ; have the egg beaten, and when the sugar has boiled 
sufficiently stir into the egg and continue stirring till cool. 
If boiled too much, and the frosting is inclined to dry before 
cooling, it can be remedied by adding a drop or two of hot 
water. 

446 Cooked Icing. 

One cup white coffee sugar ; cover with water, let it boil 
hard. Beat the white of one egg to a stiff froth ; put it in 
the sugar while boiling; beat the white constantly until almost 
cold. It is splended with flavoring. 

447 Confectioners' Icing. 

Beat the whites of two eggs with eight large spoonfuls of 
white sugar, place in a small pan and cook over the boiling 
teakettle for five minute?, stirring constantly ; spread it on the 
cake with a knife, and as quickly as possible, as it hardens 
immediately. 



FROSTING. 161 

448 Boiled Frosting. 

One pint of granulated sugar ; moisten with water sufficient 
to dissolve it when heated ; let it boil till it threads from the 
spoon, stirring often. While the sugar is boiling beat the 
whites of two eggs until they are firm ; then, when thoroughly 
beaten, place in a deep dish, and pour the boiling sugar over 
them, beating all together rapidly, until of the right consis- 
tency to spread. 

449 Boiled Frosting. 

To one quart of sugar add ten tablespoonfuls of boiling 
water ; boil the water and sugar together ; then add the whites 
of four eggs well beaten. If the cake is well dredged with 
flour after baking, and carefully wiped before the frosting is 
put on, it will not run, and can be spread on more smoothly. 

450 Cooked Frosting for One Common-Sized Cake. 

Take the white of one egg — do not beat at all — and two- 
thirds of a cup of sugar in a bowl, and set in a spider of 
warm water. As it heats mix together and cook until it 
strings like syrup for candy ; then apply hot, having the cake 
cold. I put it on with a spoon, but have a cup of hot water 
at hand, into which I dip a knife to smooth as soon as 
applied.

spoonful of butter and a tablespoonful of Snowflake baking 
powder, and a little salt ; add milk enough to make a soft 
biscuit dough, roll it out three-quarters of an inch thick, and 
put it into dripping-pans eight by twelve inches, as this is a 
good size to cut. Bake, and the moment it is dene turn out 
on to a platter, and with your carving knife open right 
through the center ; spread well with butter the top and bot- 
tom crust, then put in your currants, strawberries or raspber- 
ries, sprinkle some more sugar over, put on the top crust, and 
return to the oven for ten minutes to soak. 

We consider sweet cream essential for eating with these 
short cakes, but many people do not mind its absence. 

Strawberry short cake is made as above except that you 
mash oncThalf the strawberries and leave the other half whole.

565 Doughnuts and Crullers. 

Genuine doughnuts are raised with yeast. There is a 
spurious article that can be made very palatable with soda 
and cream of tartar or baking powder. Strange to say, the 
three latter ingredients are much more digestible than if 
made with yeast, though we still cling to the faith of our 
" fore-mothers " and believe in old-fashioned " lightning." 

566 To Prepare the Yeast for Doughnuts. 

Take from the potato pot at dinner time, two good-sized 
boiled potatoes, two heaping tablespoonfuls of flour, and a 
teacupful of the scalding potato water; mash and beat the 
whole smooth. Add a tablespoonful of white sugar and set 
it by till lukewarm, then add a Twin Brother yeast cake, and 
let it ferment from two till eight or nine o'clock p. M. 

5611 Cup Measure Doughnuts, 

One cup of lukewarm milk, four tablespoonfiils of butter, 
three eggs beaten light, half a nutmeg grated, a pinch of salt, 
half a teacup of yeast, as above, and one quart of flour ; let 
rise over night. Mold up at 9 A. m. with as little flour as 
possible ; set near the stove till 2 p. M., and fry. This receipt 
is excellent without yeast, substituting two teaspoonfuls of 
baking powder, or one of bicarbonate of soda, and two of 
cream of tartar. 



PRIED CAKES. 195 

5G8 Raised Doughnuts. 

Three-quarters of a pound of butter, one and one-half 
pounds of white sugar, five eggs, one pint of milk, one cup of 
fresh yeast, as above, and flour enough to make them of the 
consistency of bread dough ; one nutmeg and one-half tea- 
spoonful of salt. 

Process. — Mix the butter warmed in the milk, the sugar 
and eggs ; stir it into the flour until it is a soft sponge, then 
add the yeast and more flour ; set it to rise over night. 

In the morning roll out and cut into diamond shapes or 
twists, lay them on the paste-board, set them in a warm place, 
let them rise until very light, say till two or three o'clock 
p. M. ; then drop them into hot lard, turn them over in the pot, 
promptly but not hurriedly. Should the lard incline to burn, 
throw in an apple skin, or a pared potato, which will clear it 
of any scorching propensity. 

569 Delightful Baised Doughnuts. 

Beat one egg very light, in one cup of sugar ; add one table- 
spoonful of butter — sweet lard will do as well — and work it 
in one quart of raised dough ; roll out, cut in fancy strips and 
fry in boiling lard. Doughnuts are much lighter and nicer 
than to add the egg and sugar before letting it rise. Nice 
and easy as these doughnuts are, we regret to say they dry in 
two days. 

570 Raised Doughnuts. 

One pound of flour, a quarter pound of butter, three- 
quarters of a pound clean brown sugar rolled very fine, one 
nutmeg, grated, and a teaspoonful of ground cinnamon. Mix 
well together ; then add a tablespoonful of bakers' yeast, or 



196 FRIED CAKES. 

any good 3''east, with as much warm milk, with saleratus the 
size of a pea dissolved in it, as will make a smooth dough ; 
knead it for a few minutes ; cover it and set it in a warm 
place to rise for three hours or more until it is light, 
then roll it out to a quarter of an inch in thickness ; cut it 
into small squares or diamonds and fry in a kettle of nice hot 
lard over not too quick a fire. 

571 Mrs. May's Doughnuts. 

One coffee-cup of light brown sugar, two eggs, beaten before- 
hand ; one and one-half cups of milk ; two tablespoons melted 
butter ; two teaspoons of cream of tartar, one teaspoon of 
soda ; flour to make a soft dough. 

5112 Fried Cakes (Mrs. S. B. S.) 

Seven tablespoonfuls of sugar, three tablespoonfuls melted 
lard, three tablespoonfuls melted butter, three eggs, one cup 
of milk, one teaspoonful of soda, two teaspoonfuls of cream 
tartar ; flour enough to roll out very soft. 

573 Tried Cakes. 

One teacup sour cream, one coffeecup sour milk, two eggs,, 
two cups sugar, saleratus to sweeten. Put flour in bowl, then 
sugar, then eggs, cream and milk, salt and nutmeg, beat well 
together till it is a stiff batter. 

574 Try These Fried Cakes. 

One cup of sugar, two eggs, one cup of sweet milk, five 
tablespoons of butter, three teaspoons baking powder, flour to- 
make a stiff batter ; boil in hot lard ; roll in fine sugar when 
half cold. 



FRIED CAKES. 197 

575 Doughnuts. 

One pound of butter, one and a quarter pounds of sugar, 
one quart of sweet milk, four eggs, one large cup of yeast, 
one teaspoon of mace, one nutmeg, two teaspoons of cin- 
namon, one teaspoon of salt, flour enough to make as stiff 
as bread dough. Cream the butter and sugar, add the milk 
and yeast, set to rise over night. In the morning beat the 
eggs very light and stir in the spice and a little moi'e flour, 
let it rise three hours ; roll in pretty thick sheets and fry in 
lard. 



576 Crullers. 

Dissolve a teaspoonful of saleratus in four tablespoonfuls of 
milk, strain it onto half a pint of flour, four tablespoonfuls 
of melted butter or lard, and a teaspoonful of salt. Beat four 
eggs with six heaping tablespoonfuls of rolled sugar, work 
them into the rest of the ingredients, together with a grated 
nutmeg, add flour to make them stiff enough to roll out easily. 
They should be rolled out about half an inch thick, cut with 
a jagging iron or knife in strips about half an inch wide, and 
twisted so as to form small cakes. Heat a pound of lard in a 
deep kettle ; the fat should boil up as the cakes are put in, 
and they should be constantly watched while frying. When 
brown on the under side turn them ; when brown on both 
sides they are sufficiently done. 



577 Cnillers. 

Two and a half pints of unsifted or three pints of sifted 
flour, one cup of sugar, a piece of butter the size of an egg, 
three eggs, one cup of sweet milk, two teaspoonfuls of cream 



198 FRIED CAKES. 

of tartar, and one teaspoonfiil of soda. Flavor with nutmeg. 
Stir these ingredients together with a spoon, put some flour in 
the hollow of your hand, drop a spoonful on it, roll it lightly- 
round, and drop into boiling lard, or drop the batter from a 
dessert spoon. 

5KS Crullers. 

Six eggs to one cup of butter, and two of sugar and one- 
half cup of milk, and flour to roll out easily. Cut with a 
jagging iron and drop into boiling lard. Long fingers are 
requisite to give them a peculiar shape, peculiar things as well 
as peculiar people being attractive. 



SANDWICHES. 199 



SANDWICHES. 



5*79 Sandwiches. 

Take well-boiled ham, one-third fat and two-thirds lean, 
chop it until it is as fine as paste, then stir in the yolk of an 
egg. To one teaspoouful of mustard mix one tablespoonful of 
Worcestershire sauce. Use this or more, in such proportions 
as you may require. 

580 Egg Sandwiches. 

Boil eggs very hard, plunge them in ice water and let them 
get ver)'^ cold and dry. Spread slices of bread, lay them out 
on a nice white paper, or fresh towel, and grate the eggs 
through a coarse grater on each slice ; mix pepper and salt, 
and with it dust them (two heaping spoonfuls of salt to a level 
spoonful of pepper) ; then lay two slices gently together. 
This sandwich may also be varied by grating a layer of cold 
smoked tongue or ham over the egg on one slice and not on 
the other. These require a light and dexterous hand to keep 
the egg from being crushed. 

581 Sardine Sandwiches. 

Open a can of sardines, remove the skin and bones, lay bits 
of the fish on well spread bread and butter ; squeeze lemon 
over it ; lay a slice of buttered bread on top. 

5S2 Croquette Sandwiches. 

Make croquettes according to receipt, also French rolls. 
Open the rolls, scoop out the crumb, spread the inside with but- 
ter ; lay in a croquette. 



200 SANDWICHES. 

583 Egg Sandwiches (Children's School Lunches). 

Beat three eggs, three tablespoonfuls of milk, saltspoon of 
salt, and a dash of pepper ; fry it as you would [a griddle 
cake, and lay between buttered bread or biscuit, or slice hard 
boiled eggs, cut rissole balls or nice stewed cod-fish left cold, 
and lay between slices of bread and butter. 



584 Potted Ham and Tongue Sandwiches. 

It is well to keep an unopened can of each in the house, and 
then it is ready for any emergency that may arise. Spread a 
thin layer on well buttered bread, and fold together. 

5S5 Oyster Sandwiches. 

Chop raw oysters very fine, season with pepper, salt, a little 
nutmeg, and four crackers pounded and sifted ; the white of 
an egg beaten, cream and butter. When all is mixed, heat 
them over steam in an oat meal boiler, or over the fire until a 
smooth paste ; set them away to get very cold, cut and lay 
between buttered slices of bread. A quart of solid meats, a 
half teacup of melted butter, the same of rich cream, whites 
of three eggs and eight crackers. Pie paste biscuit, with slices 
of oyster sandwiches, are nicer than bread and butter. 

586 Tongue or Ham Sandwiches. 

Chop fine the lean of cold boiled tongue or ham, season 
with prepared mustard and black pepper. Add melted butter 
and sweet cream until smooth like a paste, then spread between 
buttered slices of bread. 



SANDWICHES. 201 

587 To Carry Sandwiches. 

A nice and dainty way of carrying delicate sandwiches, such 
as oysters, lobsters or egg, is to make little bags of tissue 
paper. There is a rather strong white tissue paper that can 
usually be got for this purpose. Put one or two sandwiches 
into each bag. They can be folded in papers, such as come 
for paper napkins. On all pic-nics it is a good plan to carry 
one or two substantial towels. 

588 Small Eolls with Salad Filling. 

Cut off the end of a French roll, remove the inside crumb, 
prepare a filling of cold tongue, chicken and celery, that have 
been mixed with a mayonnaise dressing ; cover the top with the 
piece that was taken off. 

589 Fried Cream 

Makes a rather nice pic-nic dish eaten cold. 



202 BREAKFAST A^D TEA RELISHES. 



BREAKFAST AND TEA RELISHES. 



590 Bichamelle, or Minced Veal. 

Mince your cold roast veal fine in a chopping-bowl, leav- 
ing out the stringy part ; put into your frying-pan a tea- 
cupful (or more as the quantity requires) of milk or sweet 
cream, into which stir, when hot, a teaspoonful of butter and 
one of flour, braided together ; then add your veal, heat it 
thoroughly through, grate a little| nutmeg, or sprinkle fine 
mace over it, and pour it into aTdish that has a border of puff 
paste leaves spread around it (you can make your leaves when 
you are making pies, and just heat them in the oven a 
moment) : then squeeze the juice of a lemon over the top of 
the minced veal, laying five or six leaves of paste on it, and 
serve. This was from old Mammy Wood, and is delicious for 
breakfast. You can make veal patties of it by just inclosing 
it in a paste and baking it. 

591 Chopped Beef. 

Take two pounds of the round of beef, chop raw, heat the 
spider, put in a small piece of butter ; add meat, season with 
salt and pepper, add a large spoonful of flour, then pour in a 
cup of milk ; season well.

through, stirring frequently ; add at the last a teaspoonful of 
ferown flour, a little water, pepper, salt, and a tablespoonful of 
vinegar. 

593 Hash. 

This dish by any other name might make a more welcome 
impression. Our receipt is for a sweet and wholesome break- 
fast relish. Take two pint bowls of cold roast beef, or corned 
beef, chop it quite fine, then chop double the quantity of pota- 
toes much coarser ; put into a frying-pan a tablespoonful of 
butter and a scant teacup of stock or boiling water ; let it boil 
up, put the hashed meat and potatoes into it and stir it from 
time to time till the liquid dries away and leaves a skin on the 
bottom of the pan. 

594 Hashed Mutton 

Is not pleasant with potatoes. Chop the mutton fine, put 
some gravy into your pan, heat the meat very thoroughly 
through, and pour on well buttered slices of toast. 



204 ENTREES, CROQUETTES, ETC. 



ENTRIES, CROQUETTES, ETC. 



595 Corned Beef to Serve Cold. 

Mrs. Henderson gives a receipt of her friend Mrs. Gratz 
Brown that we know will prove useful. If your corned beef 
is very salt soak it an hour or more in cold water, then put it 
over the fire, cover with fresh cold water, four or five cloves 
for each six pounds of beef, and three tablespoonfuls of molas- 
ses ; in an hour change the water, add another five cloves and 
three more tablespoonfuls of molasses. In two hours more 
press the beef into a colander and put a flat-iron or any 
heavy weight upon the cloth you spread over it ; let it stand 
all day. 

596 Pickled Fowl— Marinade. 

After removing the skin of a chicken, cut it in pieces and 
wash it in cold water, and clean and prepare the giblets ; cook 
these slowly for three or four hours in a pickle made of vine- 
gar and chicken soup stock in equal parts, adding salt, pepper, 
parsley, onions. Then drain them, dip them in eggs well 
beaten, roll them in flour or fine cracker crumbs, fry them, 
and serve with garniture of parsley. 

597 Fowl, Veal, or Eabbit Croquettes. 

Put in a saucepan a piece of butter the size of an egg, with 
parsley and chopped mushroons, two spoonfuls of flour, add- 
ing salt, pepper and nutmeg. Add to this soup stock and a 
little cream. This sauce should be of the consistency of thick 



ENTREES, CROQUETTES, ETC. 205 

cream. Cut the flesh of a chicken or rabbit, or piece of veal, 
in small pieces, and cook it slightly in this sauce. When it 
is cold, make it into balls with bread crumbs. Dip the balls 
in beaten egg, then dip them again in finely sifted cracker 
crumbs. Fry them to a good color and serve with a garniture 
of parsley- 
SOS Chicken or Beef Bissoles, 

Take a cold chicken (roast or boiled), or cold roast beef or 
veal, mince it very fine or it will not adhere, moisten it with 
the gravy, season with pepper, salt, thyme or onion, or a little 
cold mutton or beef, or both ; a slice of cold ham, an equal 
quantity of fine bread crumbs, a bit of sage, parsley or thyme. 
Chop well together, add one egg or more, a little melted 
butter, pepper and salt. Make up in flattened balls, dredge 
with flour and fry in hot lard. They are very nice. 

599 Friteurs. 

Put in a saucepan a little butter, two tablespoonfuls of 
flour with soup stock if you have it, if not a little water, until 
it thickens, then add minced turkey, chicken or veal, with a 
little salt. Take off" the fire and cool. Then make in any 
shape you please, say like small sausages half a finger long. 
Roll in egg and then in cracker or brown bread crumbs and 
drop into boiling lard until a delicate brown. 

600 Chicken Croquettes. 

To one good-sized chicken (after having been boiled and 
finely chopped) add one pint of rich cream, four eggs, butter

uutil thoroughly cold ; mold into oval patties. Paint the cro- 
quettes with the yolks of three eggs and roll into bread 
crumbs, after which brown them nicely in a little butter and 
gerve hot. With two sweet-breads added this receipt makes 
two dozen croquettes. 

601 Chicken Croquettes.

Here is another nice breakfast dish. Take about half a 
pound dried beef, first sliced thin, then pulled in small pieces. 
Have a quart of milk boiling, into which put the beef with a 
good piece of butter and a little pepper. When it comes to a 
boil thicken with a little flour or corn starch, then toast 
bread, a slice for each member of the family, and poach in 
hot water an equal number of eggs ; place one on each slice 
of toast ; put all on a large platter and pour over the above 
dressing and send to the table hot ; lean ham may be used in 
phice of the beef

ENTREES, CROQUETTES, ETC. 207 

a pot of hot water and let cook for twenty or thirty minutes ; 
again drain off the liquor, let the salmon cool and pour over it 
a mayonnaise dressing. Lobsters should be drained in a colan- 
der and left to air two houi*s. 

604 Salmon in a Mold. 

One can of salmon, four eggs, beaten light, four tablespoon- 
fuls of butter melted, but not hot, half a cup of fine bread

carefully. 

Lobster may be prepared in the same way, 

605 Fricatelles. "

plenty of pepper, one or two onions ; cut very fine, a little 
parsley if liked ; soak some bread in water until soft, squeeze 
it dry in a towel, add as much in proportion as the meat.

light ; stir into this one cup of cold milk ; into this mixture 
stir the meat and cook well ; then form into oblong rolls (like 
little mice without any heads or tails). Roll these in egg and 
very fine sifted cracker crumbs, and boil in lard as you do 
doughnuts. 

607 Persilade. 

Cut ^ny nice cold meat in very thin slices ; take two table- 
spoonfuls of finely chopped parsley, one small onion ; then 
beat two tablespoonfuls of vinegar, one teaspoonful of oil, one 
teaspoonful of salt, a teaspoonful of pepper vinegar or tarra- 
gon vinegar improves this ; pour this over the slices half an 
hour before serving. 

608 Stewed Kidney. 

Soak and then parboil the kidney, cut it off in inch pieces, 
roll in flour, add butter the size of an egg, and water enough 
to stew till tender ; add, if you like it, a tablespoonful of mush- 
room catsup, or walnut pickle vinegar.

Gil To Make Milk Toast. 

First toast nice slices of stale bread {i. e., one or two days 
old) ; put iu a saucepan or spider a quart of milk, with a piece 
of butter the size of an Qgg, a little salt and pepper. When 
the milk and butter are hot, but not quite boiling, dip your 
slices one by one and lay them in your tureen. When all are 
dipped just enough to moisten, but not break them, set your 
saucepan where it will come to a boil. Have ready a large 
tablespoonful of flour, made smooth with milk, and as soon as 
the milk boils stir it in till it is thickened. Turn it over the 
toast, raising the slices a little so that all may receive a share. 
This for a. family of four or five. A richer toast is made by 
buttering the slices of toast and adding a quarter of a pound 
of butter to the milk instead of the flour. 



612 Pressed Beef. 

Three pounds round steak, raw, chopped fine, six crackers 
rolled fine, three eggs beaten, one-half nutmeg, two small tea- 
spoons of pepper and a little more of salt, one cup of water. 
Put into a small-sized bread pan and bake till tender when 
tried with a fork ; baste frequently with the dripping from the 
beef The original receipt calls for three hours' baking, but 
less can be given with judgment. 



613 Beef Loaf. 

Two pounds of steak and one pound of fat pork, chopped 
fine, two and a half cups of rolled crackers, five eggs, two tea- 
spoons of pepi^er, two teaspoons of salt; mix all together and 
bake three hours in a moderate oven.

615 Veal Omelet. 

Three pounds of fresh veal and two pounds of salt pork, 
chojiped fine ; three eggs, six crackers, rolled ; one teaspoon- 
ful of salt, one of pepper, and a little parsley. Roll into an 
oblong form and baste with butter while it is baking. This 
makes a nice relish, sliced cold for tea. 

616 Fried Oysters. 

Pound crackers fine, salt and pepper them ; beat six eggs to 
a froth ; take the oysters and lay them on a towel ; place 
another over them and let them remain a short time to absorb 
the moisture ; dip the oysters in the egg, then roll in the 
cracker. Fry with a little lard, just enough to keep from 
burning, or make a batter as for American Fritters ; dip a 
spoonful up, lay an oyster into it, and drop in boiling lard. 

617 Breakfast Bacon. 

If old and a little strong, soak thin slices of bacon or pork 
in milk, dip them in a nice fritter batter and fry. Breakfast 
bacon is very nice cut in thin slices and fried quickly over a 
bright, steady fire. , 



SAVORY JELLIES- 211 



SAVORY JELLIES. 



618 Aspic Jelly. 

Take of veloute (a finely prepared veal stock made from

add to this six lemons, two sticks of cinnamon, two teaspoon- 
fuls of mace, either powdered or in blades ; salt to bring to a 
flavor, half pound of sugar ; boil two hours, set aside on the 
range to settle, and strain through flannel bags twice. 

619 Savory Chicken Jelly. 

Take a chicken, cut it in small pieces, lay it in a saucepan 
and just cover with cold water ; cook slowly until very tender, 
taking ofi'the scum as it rises. Take up the chicken and boil 
the liquor to a cupful ; remove all the bones and pick the meat 
to pieces. Season wuth salt and pepper, sweet herbs and a 
little butter ; mix with the gravy and put into a mold well 
buttered. Set in a cool place until perfectly firm. Cut in 
slices for the table. 

630 Jellied Tongue. 

One large boiled tongue (cold), two ounces of gelatine, dis- 
solved in one-half pint of water ; one teacup of browned veal

212 SAVORY JELLIES. 

solved in cold water. Add the dissolved gelatine and mix: 
well, then the boiling water, and strain through flannel. Cut 
the tongue in slices as for the table. Let the jelly cool and 
begin to thicken. Wet a mold with cold water, put a little 
jelly in the bottom, then a layer of the tongue, more jelly, and 
so on until the mold is full ; cover and set in a cool place. 
To turn it out set the mold in hot water for an instant, invert 
upon a dish and garnish with celery sprigs and nasturtion 
flowers. Cut with a sharp knife perpendicularly. This is a. 
handsome and delicious dish, and easily made. 



CHEESE. 213 



CHEESE. 

^31 Cheese Fondu. 

One cup of bread crumbs, very dry and fine ; two scant 
<jup3 of milk, rich and fresh, or it will curdle ; one-half pound 
of dry old cheese, grated ; three eggs, whipped light, one 
small tablespoonful of melted butter, pepper and salt, one 
pinch of soda dissolved in hot water, and stirred into the 
milk ; soak the crumbs in the milk ; beat in these the eggs and 
butter, seasoning, lastly the cheese; butter a baking dish, pour 
the fondu into it, strew dry bread crumbs on the top, and bake 
in rather a quick oven until delicately browned. Serve 
immediately in the baking dish, or it soon falls. 

623 Cheese Omelet. 

Quarter of a pound of melted butter, four eggs, half a 
pound of grated cheese, one teacupful of sweet cream. Melt 
the butter and pour on the eggs after they are well beaten, 
then add the cheese and cream. Bake about twenty minutes 
or cook in a frying-pan. 

623 Welsh Earebit and Cheese Balls. 

Take one-fourth of a pound of good fresh cheese ; cut in 
small thin slices and put in a frying-pan with a little over a 
teacupful of sweet milk. Stir in a previously beaten egg, 
and add a saltspoonful of dry mustard, two dashes of red 
pepper, and a small piece of butter, stirring the mixture con- 
stantly. Have ready rolled crackers, and gradually stir them 



214 CHEESE. 

in. As soon as this is thoroughly incorporated, turn it out 
into a heated dish and serve, or omit the crackers and pour 
on hot buttered toast. 

Grate three or four tablespoonfuls of cheese, give them a 
dash of red pepper, press it into balls the size of a nutmeg, 
roll them in yolk of egg, lay in your frying-basket and boil 
in hot lard. The flavor can be varied by stirring a saltspoon- 
ful of dry mustard into the egg. To be served cold for 
dessert. 



PICKLES AND CATSUP. 215 



PICKLES AND CATSUP. 



624 Brine for Cucumber Pickles. 

Five gallons of water, three quarts of salt, one pound alum, 
heat and skim well. When cool add one gallon of good vin- 
egar. This will make brine for half a barrel of pickles. I 
will warrant that your pickles will keep hard and good. 

625 For Pickling Small Cucumbers. 

Wash the cucumbers and put into a jar, throw a double 
handful of salt over them, cover with boiling water and let 
them stand twenty-four or thirty-six hours. Then, after pour- 
ing off the brine and w^iping them dry, drop a few at a time 
into scalding vinegar, to which you have added a bag of 
spices and a little sugar, and let them be until thoroughly 
heated through ; then put into jars, and pour the hot vinegar 
over them. If it is deemed desirable to have them green in 
color, they can be made beautifully so by using an old-fash- 
ioned brass kettle for scalding them in the vinegar. 

626 Cucumber Pickles. 

Make a brine strong enough to bear up an egg ; pour it 
scalding hot over the pickles. Let them stand twenty-four 
hours. Take them out, wipe and put into cold vinegar. To 
one gallon of vinegar add one tablespoonful of salt, a piece 
of ginger root, and a lump of alum the size of a walnut. Set 
them over the fire, stirring up from the bottom all the while 
until they are scalded, but not to boil. Break into them two 
or three small green peppers and bottle them.

62*7 Cucumber Pickles. 

To a hundred cucumbers put a pint of barrel salt ; pour on 
boiling water enough to cover them ; cover tightly to keep the 
steam in ; let them stand twenty-four hours ; take them out, 
drain and wipe them dry, being careful not to break the 
skins; put them in the vessel in which they are to be kept, put 
on enough pure cider vinegar to cover them. For every three 
hundred pickles take one ounce of allspice, one of cinnamon, 
one of mustard seed; use them whole. Boil the vinegar and 
spices together; while boiling pour it on the pickles and cover 
tightly. Let them stand three weeks and they are ready to 
eat. Mother used to put alum in them. Sometimes I put in 
wild grapes and a large piece of horse-radish ; this gives the 
vinegar something to live on ; also put in a few string beans, 
onions and cauliflower. These pickles will keep for years, 
and we have used the recipe in the family for forty years. 

638 Large Cucumber Pickles. 

Gather the cucumbers before the seeds are very large ; pare 
and throw into ice-cold water for an hour ; then slice as thin 
as possible, on a cabbage cutter ; sprinkled well with salt, tie 
up in a coarse cloth and lay in a colander under a heavy 
weight to drain over night. Next morning mix through them 
plenty of brown and white mustard seed ; pack in jars and 
cover well with cold cider vinegar. Put in a cool place. 
Should a white scum rise on the vinegar, drain it off and boil 
and skim well, or substitute other vinegar. Pour over them 
cold. This retains the flavor of the cucumber. 

629 Currant Catsup. 

Boil two pounds of currants in one quart of vinegar, until 
soft ; strain all through a sieve, then add three pounds of 
sugar, one ounce of nutmeg, one tablespoonful of cloves, two 
tablespoonfuls of cinnamon, and boil one hour.

630 Tomato Catsup (Best in the World). 

Take sound ripe tomatoes, slice and cook until done enough 
to j)ass through a sieve ; then to every gallon of the tomato 
pulp and juice add one teacupful chopped onion, one-half cup 
black pepper, four pods red pepper cut fine, one-half teacup 
ground ginger and dry mustard (English), mixed, one ounce 
celery seed, one-half teacup allspice, nutmeg and cinnamon 
mixed, one-half teaspoonful of cloves, two teacupfuls of sugar 
and sufficient salt to taste distinctly, one pint strong cider 
vinegar. Put all on together and cook two hours, or longer 
if not thick enough. It must not be thin or watery. Bottle 
and seal while hot, and in a cool cellar it will keep for years. 
Spices should all be the best. Do not use the ground spices 
purchased from druggists, as they are not strong enough. 

631 Tomato Catsup. 

Two pecks of tomatoes, six onions, one dozen of peach 
leaves, one bulb of garlic, one teaspoonful of red pepper, one 
tablespoonful of black pepper, two spoonfuls of ground cloves, 
two tablespoonfuls of ground mustard, one-half pound of 
brown sugar, one cup of good vinegar. Slice the tomatoes, 
sprinkle them with salt, and let them stand several hours. 
Drain them well and boil together with the peach leaves, 
onions and garlic, until done ; rub through a sieve. Boil the 
pulp until as thick as you wish. Twenty minutes before you 
take it up, add the sugar, vinegar and spice. 

632 Tomato Catsup. 

Break up the tomatoes and stew them till they are soft 
enough to strain through a colander. After straining, to one 
gallon of tomatoes put four tablespoonfuls of salt, four or five 
pods of red pepper, chopped fine, three white onions, sliced

thin. Boil to a half gallon, and when nearly done, put in 
two tablespoonfiils of ground cloves. It should be kept 
closely corked and sealed. 

633 Cucumber Catsup. 

Late in September take a bushel of full-grown cucumbers, 
peel and slice them, sprinkle them with salt, and let them 
stand over a sieve two hours, that the salt may drain off, then 
chop them fine. Add two dozen onions cut up small, one 
pound of white mustard seed, one pound of black mustard, 
one-fourth of a pound of black pepper, ground. Mix all 
together very thoroughly with the best vinegar, making it 
the consistency of a thick catsup, and fill your jars, tying up 
closely. It requires no cooking. 

634 Plum Catsup. 

To three pounds of fruit put one and three-quarters pounds 
of sugar, one tablespoonful of cloves, one tablespoonful of 
cinnamon, one tablespoonful of pepper, and very little salt. 
Scald the plums and put them through a colander, then boil 
until about the same consistency as the tomato catsup. 

635 Green Tomato Pickle. 

One peck of green tomatoes sliced, six large onions. Throw 
over a teacup of salt, and let them be all night. Drain well 
in the morning. Take two quarts of water and one of vine- 
gar, boil them in it, then drain well ; two quarts of vinegar, 
three pounds of sugar, one-half pound of white mustard seed, 
two tablespoonfuls of ground allspice, same quantity of 
cloves, cinnamon, ginger and mustard, a small teaspoonful of 
cayenne pepper. Put in a kettle and cook fifteen minutes ; 
cook a little at a time, as it burns easily. Put allspice and 
cloves in a bag.

636 Tomato Chowder. 

One-half bushel of green tomatoes, one-half peck of pep- 
pers, red and green, eight good-sized onions, two large cabbage 
heads. Chop all fine, place in an earthen jar, with one quart 
of salt, for twenty-four hours ; then strain and press thor- 
oughly ; now place in weak vinegar and boil for a few 
moments. Set it away for twenty-four hours. Then drain 
thoroughly, and add cold vinegar with these spices : two 
ounces of celery seed, two boxes of ground cinnamon, one 
tablespoonful of cloves, one pound of brown sugar, two or 
three sticks of horse-radish chopped fine. If not salty 
enough, add more to suit the taste. 

637 Green Tomato Pickles. 

Take the large smooth apple tomato, cut in two or three 
slices, and about one good-sized onion to four tomatoes, also 
sliced, put in layers in a jar, with a slight sprinkling of salt 
between each layer ; let them stand over night, in the morn- 
ing remove from the brine, rinse in cold water, drain thor- 
oughly, and boil till clear in two quarts of water to one of 
vinegar; then pour over to cover them enough vinegar, which 
has previously boiled half an hour, with cloves and whole 
pepper; pieces of horse-radish will prevent scum rising on 
any pickles ; pour the vinegar on while hot. 

638 White Pickle. 

Two quarts of vinegar, one-quarter of a pound of ground 
mustard, one-quarter pound of white mustard seed, two 
ounces of black mustard seed, one teaspoonful of root ginger, 
one teaspoonful of celery seed ; tarragon and mace to taste ; 
green and red pepper to taste ; a lemon or two cut into this 
quantity improves the flavor, as also does a root of horse

dients, and pour all when cold over sliced green tomatoes 
that have stood in salt one day and scalded as in Receipt 
635. It is equally good over beans, cucumbers, etc. 



639 Mustard Pickle, 

Fill a three-gallon jar with small green tomatoes, cucum- 
bers, nasturtions, onions, cauliflowers, horse-radish, and a few 
small green peppers. Let them stand in salt and water 
twenty -four hours. Drain off this water. Put the mixture 
in a brass or porcelain kettle with fresh water, and boil ten 
minutes ; then drain thoroughly, and put back in the jar. 
Boil three quarts of vinegar, adding three-fourths pound 
mustard wet with cold vinegar. When it thickens pour over 
the pickle.

hours ; this is splendid. 

643 Sweet Pickle. 

Take one peck of good solid green tomatoes, and onions to 
suit the taste and fancy (five quarts of tomatoes and three of 
onions), peel the onions as for boiling, wash and dry the toma- 
toes, cut them in thin slices, cut in small pieces six large 
green peppers, carefully leaving out the seeds ; put the slices 
in a large pan and sprinkle a pint of fine salt on them ; let 
them stand about twenty-four hours ; drain ofi* all the liquor, 
carefully j)ressing down the cover ; when they are sufficiently 
drained put in the preserving kettle and cover well with vine- 
gar, prepared thus: Ten or twelve ounces brown sugar to 
the quart, a tablespoonful each of ground cinnamon and cloves, 
and a spoonful of crushed white mustard seed ; boil well 
about fifteen minutes and put in pots or jars. 

644 Ragan Pickle.

645 Pickled Mangoes. 

Young musk or nutmeg melons, English mustard seed, two 
handfuls mixed with one handful scraped horse-radish, mace 
and nutmeg pounded one teaspoonful, two teaspoonfuls 
chopped garlic, a little ginger, one dozen whole pepper-corns, 
half a tablespoonful of ground mustard to a pint of the mix- 
ture, one tablespoonful sugar to the same quantity, one table- 
spoonful best salad oil to the same, one teaspoonful celery 
seed ; cut a slender piece out of the melon, save it to replace. 
Lay the mangoes in strong brine for three days, drain off the 
brine, and freshen in pure water twenty-four hours, green as 
you would cucumbers, and lay in cold water until cold and 
firm, fill with the stuffing ; tie up with packthread, pack in a 
deep stone jar and pour scalding vinegar over them, repeat 
this process three times more at intervals of two days, then 
tie up and set away in a cool, dry place ; these are very fine ; 
they will keep for months. I use nothing but white wine 
vinegar. Pepper mangoes can be fixed in the same way. 

046 Mustard Pickles. 

Two large heads of cauliflower, six heads celery, six white 
beats. Clean them and boil separately in salt and water until 
tender. The tender part of the celery is not to be boiled, but 
cut fine ; use just water enough to cover. Mix one-half pound 
of ground English mustard with vinegar, as for table use, and 
boil five minutes ; then add two bottles of best French 
mustard (or one pint of German mustard) and boil five min- 
utes longer, adding vinegar enough to cover your pickles, and 
one tablespoonful of brown sugar. If not salt enough add to 
your taste. Pour over the pickles boiling hot. As the 
pickles are used there will be a good deal of the mustard- 
vinegar left, and small cucumbers can then be put in, or small

onions ; the latter boiled a few minutes in salt water. This 
pickle keeps a long time and is very fine. Any vegetables 
liked can be substituted for cauliflower and white beets. 

647 Chow-Chow. 

Take fifty small pickles, two quarts of silver onions, two 
quarts of green string beans, one dozen green tomatoes, three 
heads of cauliflower ; let the onions stand in brine twelve 
hours, then peel. If the beans are large, break them. Slice 
the green tomatoes, cut up the cauliflowers ; let all stand in 
brine twenty-four hours. To one gallon of vinegar use one 
pound of mustard (common is the best), mix it with a little 
vinegar, and add it to the rest. One or two tablespoonfuls of 
oil of mustard, one teaspoouful of cayenne pepper — use 
more spices if preferred. Tie the spices in a white cloth, and 
boil in the vinegar, before adding the mustard. It can be 
put in preserve jars in alternate layers; fill three-quarters 
full; when filling the jars add here and there a little red and 
green pepper ; fill up with the mustard ; make air tight. 

648 Splendid Chow-Chow. 

Two quarts tomatoes, one and a half pints onions, one pint 
peppers, one cup mustard seed, two-thirds cup salt — all 
chopped fine — cover with cold vinegar. The longer it is kept 
the better it is. 

649 Pilled Peppers. 

Cut the lids off two dozen large green peppers, leave out 
seeds and soak in salt water over night ; slice fine a cabbage, 
mix with it one ounce white mustard seed and one ounce 
cloves, fill the peppers and tie the lids on ; cover with cold 
boiled cider vinegar.

650 Pickled Cabbage. 

Chop a large head of cabbage fine, one teaspoonful of mace, 
one teaspoonful of cloves; cover with vinegar. Grated 
horse-radish may be added, if liked. 

651 Yellow Pickle. 

Two gallons strong cider vinegar, one pint black mustard 
seed, four ounces ginger, three ounces black pepper, three 
ounces allspice, one ounce celery seed, one ounce turmeric, four 
lemons sliced, a few cloves, garlic, say a handful, two pounds 
sugar, handful horse-radish. Bruise all the spices and put 
them with the other ingredients in a jar and pour on the vin- 
egar cold. Tie up, but stir every day until the pickles are 
ready to put in this liquor. Take several dozen small heads 
cabbage, wash, quarter and put in strong brine ; let them lie 
in it twenty-four hours well covered, take out, rinse in cold 
water, put in a preserving kettle with sufficient vinegar to 
cover and add one ounce turmeric; scald, but by no means 
suffer to boil, cover with a plate or pan to keep the steam in ; 
let the pickle lie in the same vinegar twenty-four hours, take 
out and drop in that prepared above. This spiced liquor is 
good to use with green pickles leaving out the turmeric, and 
universally pronounced excellent and a favorite Southern 
recipe. 

652 Peach Pickle. 

To seven pounds of fruit take one quart of vinegar, three 
pounds of sugar, one teaspoonful of ground cloves and one of 
cinnamon (tied in a muslin bag), rub the peaches clean of 
their downy coat, prick them with a fork, and put them, a few 
at a time, into the spiced vinegar. Let them cook till they

are tender. Put them into jars, as taken out, and pour the 
vinegar over them. 

This is equally good for plums, quinces, or any other fruit. 

653 Sweet Peach Pickle. 

Seven pounds peaches, after being peeled, two pounds best 
sugar, one quart strong cider vinegar, two tablespoonfuls 
broken cinnamon, one teaspoon whole cloves, same of allspice. 
Put the vinegar, sugar and spices over the fire and let come to 
a boil, then drop in as many peaches as the vinegar will 
cover, and let them boil until you can pierce Avith a straw. Do 
not cook long enough for the fruit to burst. If any peaches 
are left over, take out the first put in, add the rest to the 
liquor and cook, afterward pouring the spiced vinegar over 
all, putting up in small quantities, and sealing. 

654 Sweet Pickled Peaches. 

Rub the fur off with a coarse cloth, stick three cloves in 
each peach, four pounds of sugar to a quart of vinegar, boil 
and skim, put in the peaches and boil until you can run astern 
into them, then take them out, put in a jar, pour the vinegar 
over hot, cover immediately. These are very fine. The 
peaches must be hard ones ; the yellow are the best. 

655 Pickled Apples— Very Nice. 

Two pounds of dried apples, one quart of good vinegar, 
one cup sugar, a little spice and cloves. Soak the apples all 
night, in the morning put water enough on them to cook until 
tender. Boil vinegar, sugar and spices, then put in the 
apples, boil once and you have a good dish for dinner sauce.

seed ; boil half an hour, and pour over the pickles ; put a 
weight on them. 

657 "Watermelon Pickles. 

Ten pounds of the rinds, boiled in water till tender ; make 
a syrup of two pounds sugar and one quart of vinegar, half 
ounce cloves, one ounce cinnamon ; this to be poured over the 
rinds (boiling hot) three days in succession. 

658 Pickled Onions. 

Use the small silver skinned onions, remove with a knife 
all the outer skins, so that the onions look fresh. Pour over 
them a scalding hot brine made in the proportion of one cup of 
salt to one quart of water ; let stand three days, take up, rinse 
with cold water and pour on scalding hot vinegar, spiced with 
stick ciniuimon, mace and cayenne pepper, or if the pure onion 
flavor is preferred, simply boil red or green peppers in the 
vinegar. If the onions seem hard and raw scald the vinegar 
again ; let the onions scald in it from five to fifteen minutes ; 
bottle and cork. 

659 Red Cabbage. 

Choose fine firm heads of red cabbage, remove the outer 
leaves, cut in quarters and pickle in quarters, or slice very fine 
with a knife or cabbage cutter; sprinkle thoroughly with fine 
salt and pack in a large sieve or colander ; let it drain for 
twenty-four hours, then pack in a jar and pour over scalding 
hot vinegar strongly spiced with nutmeg, cloves and pepper.

228 PRESERVING AND CANNING FRUIT. 



PRESERVING AND CANNING FRUIT. 



Canning Fruit. — Those who have to buy the fruit they 
put up, as well as the cans, may perhaps purchase to advan- 
tage of the wholesale grocer, but where one has abundance of 
fruit for the picking, and can give the time and trouble, there 
is certainly a saving in putting up the family supplies of fruit 
one's self. The cheapest way of getting cans is to buy them of 
the manufacturer, and thus save the profits of middlemen. 
The fruit should be perfectly fresh, and the sooner it is canned 
after it is taken from the tree or vine the better. If a small 
quantity, say half a dozen quarts, is cooked at one time the 
color of the fruit and the uniformity of the cooking will be 
better than if a larger quantity is attempted. There is no 
necessity of using an ounce of sugar in a gross of cans. The 
fruit will keep just as well without it, and be far more grateful 
to a healthy appetite. Glass cans with glass tops, a rubber 
band and a screw ring give the best satisfaction, as they can 
be sealed and unsealed in a moment's time. As for the pro- 
cess, when the fruit is done, pour it screeching hot into the cans ;. 
let them remain untouched fifteen or tw^enty minutes, till the 
fruit settles, then fill them full again and seal up. If the can 
is placed on a very wet cloth it will not break when the scald- 
ing fruit is put into it. Turn the cans, after screwing them up 
tightly, bottom side up, and if no syrup leaks out no air can 
get in. When cold set them away in a dark cool closet. 

664 Worth Knowing. 

In boiling fruit, take a thick cloth (or one folded in several 
thicknesses), wring it out in cold water and lay it on a table.. 



PRESERVING AND CANNING FRUIT. 22^ 

On this set the bottles for filling, and you may pour in the 
boiling fruit with impunity, thus avoiding the discomfort of 
standing over a hot stove during the process, handling heated 
bottles. If the cloth becomes warm wring it out again. Some 
persons think a dry cloth answers the same purpose. 

665 To Prevent Mildew on Preserves. 

Take the white of an egg and Avet slightly both sides of a 
piece of letter paper, sufficiently large to cover over the top of 
the preserves snugly. I have kept them free from mold and 
spoiling two years. 

666 Currant Jelly. 

This receipt is the only one which we will warrant to make 
good jelly against odds. We have made jelly by it on the 5th 
of July, and on the 15th, and each time it was a perfect suc- 
cess. While we recommend all persons to make their jelly 
from fresh fruit early in the season, we can still assure those 
who are behind hand that they need not despair of jelly that 
will set firm and hard later in the season. 

Run the currants through your hand, picking out the leaves, 
and any stray thing that may adhere to them, but leaving the 
currants on their stems. Weigh the fruit, being accurate in 
remembering the number of pounds. Put a pint of w^ater into 
your preserving kettle, and add a bowl or two of currants, 
mashing and pressing them till you have sufficient juice to 
cover the bottom of the kettle, then add the remainder of the 
currants ; let them come to a boil, and boil at least twenty 
minutes, of course stirring and pressing them from time to 
time, that they may not burn. Have a three-cornered bag of 
thin, but strong, unbleached cotton, that has been well scalded 
4ind wrung till almost dry ; hang it up and pour the boiled 



230 PRESERVING AND CANNING FRUIT. 

currants into it. Let it drip into a stone crock all night, but 
by no means squeeze it ; the currants will drain perfectly dry. 
In the morning pour the strained juice into the preserving 
kettle, without measuring; let it come to a boil, and boil thor- 
oughly for three or four minutes, then pour in half as many 
pounds of sugar as you had pounds of currants. For instance, 
a peck of currants will probably weigh twelve pounds, there- 
fore use six pounds of sugar. The moment the sugar is entirely 
dissolved the jelly is done. To make sure of the sugar being 
entirely dissolved, see that it begins to jelly on the ladle. It 
will look thick, and drop thick and a little stringy, but if let 
heat beyond this point it will lose its thickness, and not jelly^ 
nearly so well, and always disappoints you if you lose faith in 
your instructions and insist upon " letting it come to a boil.'^ 
All the boiling is done before you put in the sugar. 

667 Currant Jelly— A Boston Reoeipt (Mrs. L.) 

Take out leaves, leave stems on ; put one peck of currants 
in a kettle with two quarts of water, or water till you can just 
see it ; boil till fruit is tender, turn the fruit into a sieve or 
colander to drip ; measure juice and return to kettle, boil ten 
minutes ; while boiling add one pound or pint of sugar to one 
pound or pint of juice ; boil up once, skim and strain through 
a thin bag. 

668 Easpberry and Currant Jelly. 

One quart of currants, one quart of red or Antwerp rasp- 
berries, two cups of white sugar, one package of gelatine 
soaked in one cup of cold water; one cup of boiling water, 
whipped cream, made very sweet, for center ; crush the fruit 
in a stoneware jar with a wooden beetle, and strain out every 
drop of the juice that will come away. Stir the sugar and 



PRESERVING AND CANNING FRUIT. 231 

soaked gelatine together ; pour the boiling water over them ; 
when clear, strain into the fruit juice. Strain again through 
flannel bag, wet an " open " mould, fill wdth the jelly, and 
bury in ice to form. Turn out upon a very cold dish ; fill 
the center with the cream. 



669 Strawberry Jelly. 

One quart of strawberries, one large cup of white sugar, juice 
of one lemon, one-third of a package of Cox's gelatine, soaked 
in one cup of cold water, one pint of boiling water ; mash 
the strawberries to a pulp and strain through coarse muslin. 
Mix the sugar and lemon juice with the soaked gelatine, stir 
up well and pour over them the boiling water. Stir until 
clear ; strain through a flannel bag, add the strawberry juice ; 
strain again without shaking or pressing the bag ; wet a mold 
with cylinder in center, in cold water; fill it and set it in ice 
to form. Turn out upon a cold dish ; fill with whipped cream 
made quite sweet with powdered sugar, and serve at once. It 
is very fine. 



670 Crab-Apple Jelly. 

Boil the fruit whole in water enough to cover it until it is 
perfectly soft, then pour the contents of the kettle into a 
coarse linen bag and suspend it between two chairs, with a 
pan under it, and leave it until it ceases to drip. Then press 
it a very little. Allow a pound of sugar to a pint of the 
juice— if you choose, add the juice of a lemon to every quart 
of syrup. Boil the juice first and skim it ; heat the sugar in 
a dish in the stove oven and add it as the syrup boils up. 
Boil gently twenty minutes and pour in tumblers or molds. 



232 PRESERVING AND CANNING FRUIT. 

671 Apple Jelly. 

Core and quarter, but not pare, tart apples. Cook in a 
little more water than will cover them till well reduced. 
Strain, add one pound of sugar to one pint of the juice, boil 
twenty minutes or lialf an hour, and strain carefully into your 
molds. Slices of lemon or Jamaica ginger may be added to 
the apples while boiling. 

en 2 Cranberry Jelly. 

Cover the cranberries with water, and let boil for twenty or 
thirty minutes ; break the berries and scald once more ; then 
pour into a jelly bag, and let drip over night — do not squeeze; 
weigh a pound of sugar to every pint of juice. Let the juice 
come to a boil and boil five minutes ; then pour in the sugar 
and stir till thoroughly dissolved. This jelly will set without 
coming to a boil. 

673 Grape Jelly. 

Differs only by heating the grapes ; bruising them mean- 
time with a ladle or potato masher, until the juice runs freely, 
then strain through a sieve or thin cloth, and measure one 
pint for one pound of sugar. Boil the juice fifteen or twenty 
minutes before putting in the sugar; after adding the sugar 
let it boil from three to five minutes. 

All fruit will form more readily in a jelly if not quite ripe. 

674 Lemon Jelly. 

One ounce of gelatine (red the best), one pound of sugar, 
one quart of boiling water, four lemons ; cut the lemons in 
slices and bruise them, then add the sugar and gelatine, and 
pour upon the whole the boiling water ; set the vessel contain-

675 Pieplant Jelly, 

Pick the pieplant and wash, but do not peal it, cut in strips, 
put ill the kettle, add enough of water to cook until soft, 
strain tlie juice off and weigh, add sugar pound for pound; 
cook ten minutes, or as thick as you wish, 

676 Orange Marmalade. 

Three pounds of oranges, two pounds of lemons, five pounds 
of sugar. 

Directions. — Peel the oranges ami lemons, put the skins 
of both in the preserving pan, cover with water and cook till 
tender ; then take them out, and put the pulps into the same 
water and cook from one to two hours, adding more water if 
it gets too thick ; while the pulp is cooking cut the skins in 
strips as fine as possible; strain the pulp through a jelly bag, 
and put the juice back in the pan with the sugar; when it is 
dissolved put in the skins ; boil about fifteen minutes, and it 
is ready to put in bowls. 

677 Raspberry Jam. 

One pound sugar to one pound berries. Boil three-quarters 
of an hour. Seal while hot. 

678 Raspberry Vinegar, No. 1. 

Red raspberries, any quantity, or sufficient to fill a stone 
jar nearly full, then pour upon them enough vinegar to cover 
them, cover the jar closely and set it aside for eight or ten 
days, then strain through flannel or muslin and add to the 
clear liquor one and a half pounds of sugar to each pint ; 
place over the fire and boil gently for a few minutes, then 
allow it to cool and bottle for use. This makes, when mixed 
with ice water, a delightful summer drink. 



234 PRESERVING AND CANNING FRUIT. 

679 Easpterry Vinegar, No. 2. 

Twelve boxes of raspberries, one coffeeciip of vinegar, one 
pound of sugar to one pint of juice. After straining the 
juice add sugar and vinegar. Let it come to a boil. Bottle 
and seal while hot. 

680 Raspberry Syrup. 

An improved method of preparing raspberry syrup consists 
in allowing the fruit to remain crushed for two or three days^ 
then pressing out the juice and placing it in glass jars, the 
necks of which are closed by dipping in wax. The juice 
ferments rapidly, after which syrup becomes clear, and may 
be readily bottled and kept for use. 

681 Preserved Citron Melons. . 

Pare, core, and cut the melons into slices; weigh them, and 
to every six pounds of melon allow six pounds of white sugar, 
and the juice and yellow rind — pared off thin — of four 
lemons ; also, half a pound of race ginger ; put the slices into 
a preserving kettle, cover with water, and a layer on all of 
peach leaves ; boil about half an hour, or until clear, and a 
broom-whisk will pierce them ; drain them, spread them in a 
pan of cold water, and let them stand all night; next morn- 
ing tie the ginger in a thin muslin cloth and boil it in three 
pints of water until the water is highly flavored ; take out the 
ginger ; dissolve the sugar in the ginger-water, put in the 
lemon peel and boil and skim it till no more scum rises ; take 
out the lemon peel, put in the citron slices and juice of the 
lemons, and boil in the syrup till the slices are transparent 
and a straw will go through them ; put the slices, while warm, 
in jars, and pour the syrup on slowly ; cover closely with 
paper which the air cannot penetrate, or air-tight jars.

083 To Preserve Citron for Cake "Without its Being too 
Hard. 

Steam it, uot too much ; then melt your sugar, put the citron 
into it and cook as you would for preserves ; dry it slowly in 
a warm oven ; repeat this process several times. Flavor with 
lemon, if you choose ; brown sugar is the best, if you wish to 
have it look dark. In order to have it moist and easy to cut 
care must be taken not to dry it too much. When ready to 
lay away sprinkle sugar over it and it will keep nicely. 

I have just preserved some citron for cake as above directed, 
and it is just as nice as any you will find on sale at fifty cents 
per pound. 

683 Lemon Marmalade. 

Every housekeeper should keep a jar filled with brine, in 
which she may throw lemon peels after having used the grated 
rind and juice for creams, jellies, etc. These may remain any 
length of time. Before preserving, soak in pure water until 
all the taste of salt is extracted. Boil till soft enough to 
pierce with a straw. Put in a preserving kettle nine pounds 
of cut sugar and one quart of water; as soon as it boils add 
six pounds of lemon peel and three pounds of nice sliced 
apples (pippins are best) ; boil till very thick. 

684 Lemon Conserves, 

Wash and dry ten lemons ; pare the yellow rind off clear of 
the white, and beat it in a mortar, with double its weight .of 
sugar. Pack closely in a jar and cover with part of the 
sugar.

Put one and one-half pounds of white sugar to each pint of 
juice ; add some peel and boil ten minutes ; then strain and

cork. It makes a fine beverage, and is useful for flavoring 
pies and puddings. The juice of any acid fruit may be used 
in the same way. 

086 Orange Marmalade. 

Grate the rind of two oranges, scrape out the pulp and 
measure; add the same amount of sugar, and boil thoroughly. 

687 Ripe Tomato Preserves. 

Seven pounds sound, yellow tomatoes, and six pounds of 
sugar ; the juice of three large lemons. Peel the tomatoes and 
let all stand together over night ; drain off the syrup and boil 
it, skimming well ; then put in the tomatoes and boil gently 
for twenty minutes ; take out the tomatoes with the skimmer 
and spread on dishes to cool. Boil down the syrup until 
it thickens ; put the preserves in jars and fill up with hot 
syrup. 

688 Preserved Currants. 

Ten pounds currants, seven pounds sugar ; take the stems 
from seven pounds of the currants, and press the juice from 
the other three pounds. When the juice and sugar are made 
into a hot syrup, put in the currants and boil until thick and 
rich. 

689 Preserved Quinoes. 

Pare, quarter and core the fruit, saving skins and cores. 
Put the quinces over the fire with just enough water to cover 
them, and simmer until perfectly tender, but do not let them 
break. Take out the fruit and spread on dishes to cool ; add 
the parings and cores to the water in which the quinces were 



PRESERVING AND CANNING FRUIT. 237 

boiled, and cook one hour ; then strain through a jelly bag, 
and to each pint of this liquor allow a pound of sugar. Boil 
and skim this, then put in the fruit and boil fifteen minutes. 
Take it off the fire and let it stand in a deep dish twenty-four 
hours. Then drain off the syrup, and let it boil again ; put in 
the quinces and cool fifteen minutes. Take out the fruit and 
spread on dishes to cool ; boil down the syrup thick ; put the 
fruit in your jars until two-thirds full, then cover ^yith the 
syrup. 

690 Apples for Tea. 

Pare a dozen or more apples, take out the core carefully 
and fill the center of each apple with sugar and a small lump 
of butter. Put them in a pan with half a pint of water ; baste 
occasionally with the syrup while baking. When done serve 
with cream. 

691 G-rape Jam. 

Pick the grapes from the stem and wash them ; after they 
are drained slip the pulp from the skin, keeping them in sep- 
arate dishes ; then boil the pulp until it will easily part from 
the seeds. Strain through a colander, rinsing the seed with a 
little water. Boil the skins (adding some water) until they are 
quite tender. (The Isabella will not become as tender as other 
varieties.) Then put all together and weigh one pound of 
sugar to one pound of fruit. Boil two or three minutes, and 
put into cups or jars. 

692 Ripe Peach Marmalade. 

One-half pound of sugar, one pound of peaches, cut up ; 
put the sugar over ; cook slowly two hours ; put in cups or 
bowls. 



238 PRESERVING AND CANNING FRUIT. 

693 Mrs. L.'s Receipt for Preserving Peaches. 

One peck of rich yellow peaches, five pounds of crushed 
sugar, one quart of water. Boil the syrup until clear, and, 
in the mean time, fill cans or jars with peaches, packed as full 
as possible, whole or in halves, as you please. Pour the syrup 
boiling hot over them ; then place the jars thus filled in pans 
of water on the stove and let them be heated to the boiling 
point ; then seal. 



CANDY. 239 



CANDY. 

694 Pop Corn Balls. 

To six quarts of popped corn boil one pint of molasses about 
fifteen minutes ; then put the corn into a large pan, pour the 
boiled molasses over it, stirring briskly till thoroughly mixed. 
Then make into balls of the desired size. 

695 Mamie's Molasses Candy. 

Two cups of brown sugar, one cup of molasses, a piece of 
butter the size of a nutmeg ; boil. Wlien done put in one tea- 
spoonful of soda (dry and fine) and stir well about a minute. 
Pour into buttered pans, let cool and pull. 

696 Molasses Candy. 

Two cups of molasses, one and one-half cups of brown sugar, 
one-half cup of vinegar, one-fourth cup of butter. Made thus 
there will be no adhering to the fingers in pulling, and sticks 
as white and delicious as any one could wish for will be the 
result. 

697 Bell's Candy. 

Two cups of sugar, one cup of water, juice of two lemons; 
let the sugar and water boil " to the crack " (or thirty or forty 
minutes), in a frying-pan or spider ; add the lemon and stir 
ten minutes after removing from the fire. 

698 Overton Taffy. 

One pound of powdered loaf sugar, one teacupful of water, 
one-quarter pound of butter, six drops of essence of lemon. 



240 CANDY. 

Put the water and sugar into a brass pan, and beat the butter 
to a cream ; when the sugar is dissolved, add the butter, keep 
stirring the mixture over the fire until it sets, when a little 
is poured onto a buttered dish ; just before it is done, add the 
lemon, butter a dish or tin, pour on it the mixture, and when 
it is cool it will come off. 

699 Caramels. 

One-half cake Baker's chocolate, one-half cup milk, one 
cup molasses, two cups sugar, one-half cup butter, vanilla. 
Boil till it will harden in water. Pour upon platters, and 
when nearly cold, cut into squares. 

700 Vinegar Candy. 

Three teacups white sugar, one of vinegar, boil until it will 
harden in cold water ; just before it is done add a little 
butter, size of walnut. Do not stir while boiling ; pour in a 
pan to cool, flour the hands and pull until perfectly white. 

Very nice candy is made by using three cups sugar, one 
cup of w^ater, and one tablespoon cream tartar, not quite as 
much butter as for vinegar candy. 

701 Sugar Candy. 

Six cups of sugar, one cup of vinegar, one cup of water, 
one spoonful of butter, one teaspoonful of soda, dissolved in 
a spoonful of boiling water. Boil all together without stir- 
ring for half an hour, flavor with wintergreen, or to the taste, 
and cool on plates or pull in the old style of molasses candy. 

702 Cocoanut Candy. 

Is the same as the above, except one-half a cup of vinegar 
and double the amount of butter is used, and the grated or 
dessicated cocoanut is used in the proportion of one cup to 
every cup of water.

to dry in a warm place. 

Or, pour four ounces of lemon juice upon one pound of loaf 
sugar with the same amount of rose water as of lemon juice ; 
boil to a thick syrup, add grated lemon peel and proceed as 
in the first recipe.

242 PICKLING BRINE. 



PICKLING BRINE. 



705 To Cure Meat. 

For those who raise and cure their own meat, the following 
will be an excellent recipe : To one gallon of water take one 
and one-half pounds of salt, one-half pound of sugar, one-half 
ounce of saltpetre, one-half ounce of potash. In this ratio, 
the pickle to be increased to any quantity desired. Let these 
be boiled together until all the dirt from the sugar rises to 
the top and is skimmed off. Then throw it into a tub to cool, 
and when cold, pour it over your beef or pork, to remain the 
usual time, say four or five weeks. The meat must be well 
covered with pickle, and should not be put down for at least 
two days after killing, during which time it should be slightly 
sprinkled with powdered saltpetre, which removes all the 
surface blood, etc., leaving the meat fresh and clean. 

Some omit boiling the pickle, and find it to answer well, 
though the operation of boiling purifies the pickle by throw- 
ing off the dirt always to be found in salt and sugar. 

If this recipe is properly tried it will never be abandoned. 
There is none that surpasses it, if so good. 

706 To Corn Beef. 

One peck of coarse salt, four ounces of saltpetre, one and 
a half pounds of brown sugar, one and a half pints of 
molasses ; add to the above four gallons of water, boil and 
skim until clear. When cold it is fit for use ; salt the meat 
a few hours before it is put into the pickle. 



PICKLING BRINE. 243 

707 Birine for Curing Beef and Tongue. 

Six gallons of water, nine pounds of salt, three pounds of 
brown sugar, one quart of molasses, three ounces of saltpetre; 
boil all together and skim; when cold pour on the beef. This 
is quantity sufficient for one hundred pounds ; keep closely 
covered and under the brine. 

708 Eeceipt for Curing Hams. 

To eight hams of common size, take eight pounds of brown 
sugar, one and a half pounds of saltpetre, five pounds of fine 
salt. Rub the hams with the mixture, and let them remain a 
week with the skins downward. Then make brine of common 
salt and water, strong enough to bear up an egg ; add two or 
three quarts of lye made from hickory ashes, refined by boil- 
ing and skimming. Cover the hams with this liquid, keeping 
them down with a w^eight. Let them remain in it from four 
to six weeks according to their size, then take them out and 
let them drain there for a day before sending them to the 
smoke house.

244 WASHING AND CLEANING. 



WASHING AND CLEANING. 



709 The Use of Borax. 

The washerwomen of Holland and Belgium, so proverbially- 
clean, and who get their linen so beautifully white, use fine 
borax for washing powder instead of soda, in the proportion 
of a large handful of borax powder to ten gallons of water. 
They save soap nearly one-half. All the large washing 
establishments adopt the same mode. For laces, cambrics, 
etc., an extra quantity of the powder is used ; and for crino- 
lines (requiring to made stiff) a stronger solution is necessary. 
Borax, being a neutral salt, does not in the slightest degree 
injure the texture of linen. Its effect is to soften the hardest 
water, and therefore it should be kept on the toilet table. 
As a way of cleaning the hair, nothing is better than a solu- 
tion of borax in water. It leaves the scalp in a most cleanly 
condition, and the hair is just sufficiently stiffened to retain 
its place. This stiffness, however, can be readily removed, if 
objectionable, by washing with water. Borax is also an 
excellent dentrifrice; dissolved in water, it is one of the best 
tooth-washes. In hot countries it is used, in combination 
with tartaric acid and bicarbonate of soda, as a cooling bev- 
erage. 

710 To Wash Flannel Without Shrinking It. 

Have plenty of hot soft water, make a suds with good soap, 
rub the clothes clean and rinse out all the soap. Do not let 
the clothes cool from the time they are wet till they are ready 
to put on the line. Put them into the next suds or tlie rins- 



WASHING AND CLEANING. * 245 

ing water as fast as wrung out, and let them cool in the basket 
before you hang them up. Wash them in the morning, on a 
sunshiny day if possible, so they will have a good chance to 
dry. 

711 To Wash Colored Flannels. 

Make a suds of cold water and ordinary bar soap ; wash 
the garment and rinse in cold water. Press while it is still 
damp. In this way children's fancy sacques and bright 
dresses may be kept looking like new, neither shrinking nor 
changing color. Don't be afraid to try it. 

A gallon of strong lye put in a barrel of hard water will 
made it as soft as rain Avater. 

712 To Wash Flannels. 

Make a suds of soft water as hot as you can bear your 
hands in. Rinse in same way, and dry quickly. Use old 
soft soap, as the chemicals in hard soap full the flannels. This 
recipe will apply to all woolen goods. Our own method of 
rinsing flannels and blankets istoputa tablespoonful of spirits 
of ammonia to a gallon of water ; shake and rinse the woolen 
goods in this and dry them quickly. 

713 To Remove Grass Stains. 

Pour boiling hot water on the stains before washing the 
garments. 

714 Nice Glossy Staroh. 

To three cups water take three rounded teaspoonfuls of 
starch, a pinch of salt and one teaspoonful of powdered 
borax. Dissolve your borax in part of the water, then add 



246 • WASHING AND CLEANING. 

starch and salt, dip your collars, cuffs and bosoms into the 
starch. Your irons must be good ; rub them with bee's- wax, 
and I promise you a stiff, glossy surface with never a failure. 

715 To Hemove Iron Bust Stains. 

Moisten the spot with a solution of epsom salts in a few 
drops of hot water, and rub in well once or twice ; then fill a 
tin vessel with boiling water and set it on the stain ; rinse in 
cold water. 

716 To Eemove Mildew. 

Rub common brown soap on the spot, and scrape white 
chalk in it. Keep wet and lay in the sun. 

717 To Eemove Scorches. 

Scorches made by over-heated flat irons can be removed 
from linen by spreading over the scorched cloth a paste made 
of the juice pressed from two onions, one-half ounce of white 
soap, two ounces of fuller's earth, and half a pint of vinegar. 
Mix, boil well and cool before using. 

718 To Prevent Blue Fabrics from Fading. 

Dissolve two teaspooufuls of sugar of lead in one gallon of 
water, soak the stockings or cloth in this solution from half 
to one hour, according to material. Delicate fabrics need to 
soak only until saturated ; rinse before washing and wash 
quickly. 

719 Bluing. 

One^'ounce of best Prussian blue, half ounce of oxalic acid^ 
one quart of soft water. Heat enough of the water to dis- 
solve the acid, then stir in the blue, add cold water and bottle 
for use ; keep in the cellar. 



WASHING AND CLEANING. 247 

720 To Wash Black Prints, Alpacas and Waterproofs. 

To a boilerful of strong soap-suds, put two handfuls of log- 
wood chips, and let it boil half an hour ; strain. Free the 
garment from grease spots and wet it thoroughly. Put it 
into the boiler and let it boil several minutes. Take it out 
and rinse in clear cold water until the water is colorless. 
Woolens should be ironed on the wrong side while quite 
damp. 

721 Washing Compound— Our Own. 

Cut up one bar of soap in two quarts of water ; to this add 
one-quarter of a pound of commercial borax ; in the evening 
stand a bowl containing this mixture over a kettle of hot 
water, and in the morning it will be of a wax-like consistency. 
Put a teacupful of this mixture into every pail of water in 
your wash-boiler. 

722 How Summer Suits should be Washed. 

Summer suits are nearly all made of white or buff linen, 
pique, cambric, or muslin, and the art of preserving the new 
appearance after washing is a matter of the very greatest 
importance. In the hands of ordinary washerwomen, the 
linens and cambrics and piques lose all their beauty, and 
come out pale, faded and stretched the wrong way, ironed up 
instead of down, and down instead of up. It is woi'th while 
for ladies to pay attention to this, and insist upon having their 
summer dresses washed according to the directions which they 
should be prepared to give the laundresses themselves. In the 
first place, the water should be tepid, the soap should not be 
allowed to touch the fabric ; it should be washed and rinsed 
quickly, turned upon the wrong side, and hung in the shade to 
dry, and when starched (in thin boiled, but not boiling starch) 



248 WASHING AND CLEANING. 

should be folded in sheets or towels, and ironed upon the 
wrong side as soon as possible. But linen should be washed 
in water in which hay has been boiled, or a quart bag of bran. 
This last will be found to answer for starch as well, and is 
excellent for print dresses of all kinds. A handful of salt is 
very useful also to set the colors of light cambrics and dotted 
lawns ; and a little beef's gall will not only set but heighten 
yellow and purple tints, and has a good effect upon green. 



723 To Clean Silk Dresses. 

Equal quantities of alcohol, molasses and soft soap ; one pint 
of each will do two dresses ; beat well together, and after 
spreading a breadth of silk on a clean kitchen table, scour it 
with an old but clean clothes brush ; have three tubs or pails 
of water, take up the breadth of silk by the top and dip it up 
and down in first one pail, then the second and then the third. 
When there is no color left in the water the rinsing is com- 
plete. Pin the breadths to the clothes line without wringing. 
When a little damp press out with a cold iron. Before cleaning 
rub the grease spots with pure naphtha or gasoline. We have 
used this horrid-looking mixture with the best success on even 
light silks and silks with white stripes. 



724 To Restore Old Velvet. 

First brush the velvet thoroughly to free it from dust, then 
sponge the under side with alcohol, have ready a very hot 
flat-iron inverted (this may be kept in place by putting the 
handle downward between two cold ones), and lay over it a 
wet cloth. While the steam rises pass the wrong side of the 
velvet over it to raise the pile.

Por Removing Grease from Woolen Goods. 

Nothing can exceed gasoline to remove grease, and we 
sponge bad or old grease spots with gasoline before cleaning 
the articles with either of the four following receipts : 

725 To Clean Woolen G-arments and Boys' Clothes. 

One ounce of borax, one ounce of spirits of camphor, one 
quart of boiling water. Lay a thick towel under the spot; 
then rub the soiled place with a woolen cloth dipped in the 
mixture. 

726 Japanese Cream. 

A most admirable detergent ; try it and you will keep it 
always on hand. Four ounces white castile soap, four ounces 
ammonia, two ounces ether, two ounces alcohol, one ounce 
glycerine. Cut the soap fine, dissolve in one quart of soft 
water over the fire. When dissolved, add four quarts more 
of water, then add the spirits. 

727 Paint Spots. 

When neither turpentine nor benzine will remove paint spots 
from garments, try chloroform. It will absorb and remove 
paint which has been on for six months. 

728 How to Clean Carpets of Any Kind. 

Beat and shake thoroughly clear of dust ; then tack smoothly 
to the floor, and with a scrubbing brush apply the follow- 
ing mixture : Half pound borax, one quarter pound sal soda, 
half ounce alum, one and a half pounds of rosin soap ; cover 
with water and boil until dissolved ; then pour into two 
buckets of water (rain water best) ; let stand until all thick- 



250 WASHING AND CLEANING. 

ens. When ready to use add half a pint of alcohol and one 
gill of ammonia. Scrub one place at a time thoroughly, the 
same as you would scrub a floor. Sponge off with clean, cold 
water, and leave doors and windows open till dry. This 
operation requires patience, muscle and elbow grease ; but if 
directions are carefully followed, the " old rag" or any other 
kind of carpet will smile up at you bright and fresh as new. 

139 To Remove Soorohes. 

When a garment is yellowed by a too hot iron, expose it 
for a little while to the bright sun light, and if the scorch be 
not too deep, it will disappear. 

730 Stains from Linen, Silk, or Woolen. 

Four tablespoonfuls of spirits of ammonia, the same quan- 
tity of alcohol, and a tablespoon of salt. Shake the whole 
well together in a bottle and apply with a sponge or tooth 
brush. This removes ink, paint, fruit or acid stains from silk, 
linen or woolen articles. 

731 How to Wash Matting. 

Put a mixture of salt and lemon juice on the stains ; leave 
this for some hours without washing off; then wash the whole 
matting with salt and water. 

Ammonia in the water will whiten and brighten old white 
matting. 



TO BANISH VERMIN. 251 



TO BANISH VERMIN. 



Perpetual vigilance is the price of freedom from the world 
of insects. 

732 A Cure for Bedbugs. 

Grasoline or a strong sohition of ammonia are both good reme- 
dies. 

The only sure remedy that, in the course of seventeen years, 
we have invariably found efficacious, *is a preparation of cop- 
peras, one pound to one gallon of boiling water. The most 
infected house we ever saw was cleared by filling a syringe 
with this fluid and shooting it into the cracks and crevices of 
the rooms and walls. Sponging or painting the bedstead with 
this solution will drive them away for months and forever. 
The only drawback to this is that it leaves a stain like 
iron rust. 

Oil of cedar is an excellent and cleanly remedy. Salt and 
kerosene oil in cracks and under base boards is good. 

733 A Red Pepper Smoke. 

This is the surest of all we ever tried : Hang up in a closet 
or clothes press all woolen things, such as dresses, clothes, over- 
coats, etc., and take a few ounces of cayenne pods (the 
imported article), or the dried red pepper of our gardens, and 
putting them upon some live coals in a tin pan, the bottom of 
which is covered with ashes, shut them close into your closet, 
and let it remain without opening for twenty-four hours ; an 
attic infested with moths may require this process repeated three 



252 TO BANISH VERMIN. 

or four times. Carpets which are on the floors cannot, of 
course, be treated in this fashion, but by following round the 
base board (where they mostly lodge) with a wet sheet or 
towel of several thicknesses, and pressing the same with a very 
hot iron, until the steam from the wet cloths penetrates 
the thickness of the carpet, the insects and their eggs will be 
killed. 

Alum is said to be an excellent preventive of moths; have 
it powdered fine and sprinkled where they appear. 

To fold furs tightly in black inky newspapers early in the 
season is highly recommended. 

734 To Drive Away Red Ants. 

Grease a plate with lard and set it where the ants are 
troublesome ; place a few sticks around the plate for the ants 
to climb up on ; they wdll desert the sugar bowl for the lard ; 
occasionally turn the plate over a fire where there is no smoke 
and the ants will drop into it ; reset the plate, and in a few 
repetitions you will catch all the ants ; they trouble nothing 
else while the lard is accessible. 

735 To Destroy Insects. 

The Journal of Chemistry publishes a recipe for the 
destruction of insects, which, if it be one-half as eflftcacious as it is 
claimed to be, will prove invaluable : " Hot alum water is a 
recent suggestion as an insecticide. It will destroy red and 
black ants, cockroaches, spiders, chintz bugs, and all the 
crawling pests which infest our houses. Take two pounds of 
alum and dissolve it in three or four quarts of boiling water ; 
let it stand on the fire till the alum disappears ; then apply it 
with a brush, while nearly boiling hot, to every joint and 
crevice in your closets, bedsteads, pantry, shelves and the like ; 



TO BANISH VERMIN. 258 

brush the crevices in the floor of the skirting or mop boards 
if you suspect that they harbor vermin. If, in whitewashing 
a ceiling, plenty of alum is added to the lime, it will also serve 
to keep insects at a distance. Cockroaches will flee the paint 
which has been washed in cool alum water. Sugar barrels 
and boxes can be freed from ants by drawling a chalk mark 
just around the edge of the top of them. The mark must be 
unbroken, or they will creep over it ; but a continuous chalk 
mark, half an inch in width, will set their depredations at 
naught. Powdered alum or borax will keep the chintz bugs 
at a respectable distance, and travelers should always carry a 
package in their hand-bags to scatter over and under their 
pillows, in places where they have reason to suspect the pres-

736 To G-et Rid of Water Bugs and Cockroaches. 

Powdered borax sprinkled over water pipes, closet shelves, 
etc., will drive them away. Should this fail, use Paris green 
or equal quantities of red lead flour and sugar on your water 
pipes. 

737 To Drive Away Mice. 

Moisten chloride of lime, and stop their holes of ingress with 
the paste. If the holes are inaccessible, set the chloride 
around on small plates. Mice do not like it. 

738 To Get Hid of Black Ants. 

Get five cents worth of tartar emetic, mix in an old saucer 
with sugar and water, and set in your pantry or cupboard, 
where the ants trouble you. In twenty-four hours every ant 
will have left the premises. With me the same dish of tartar 
emetic answered as well the second year as the first ; as the 
water dries out add more.

739 To Purify Dairy Utensils. 

Stand on end, in a convenient place for use, an open-ended 
vessel of suitable dimensions for the size of the dairy, say 
from half a barrel to a hogshead. In this slake some good 
quicklime, enough to make a thin whitewash, then fill full of 
water, and cover to keep out dust and dirt. The lime will 
settle, leaving a saturated solution of lime over it, as clear as 
spring water. After using the milk-pans, etc., wash them as 
other utensils are washed and rinsed, then dip them in the 
adjoining cask of lime water, giving them a quick turn, so that 
every part becomes immersed therein ; set them to drain and 
dry, and the purification is complete, without any scalding 
process, from the new pan to the worn-out one. The lime in 
the clear water instantly neutralizes the acidity of the milk 
yet remaining in the cracks or seams, etc., of the milk vessels, 
to destroy which the process of scalding has been performed. 
In the case of a very small dairy, or of one cow, the clear 
water may, if preferred, be dipped out for the time being and 
poured gently back again, the lime purifying the water and 
keeping it good all summer. Of course there will be a little 
waste from evaporation, which will be made up by adding 
clear water as needed, the lime settled in the bottom of the 
cask keeping up the strength of the saturated solution. Let 
any one who reads and doubts its efficacy, simply try it thor- 
oughly, and he will eflTect a great saving in time and cost.

740 To Make Cows Give Milk. 

A writer who says his cow gives all the milk that is wanted 
in a family of eight persons, and from which was made two 
hundred and sixty pounds of butter last year, gives the fol- 
lowing as his treatment. He says : " If you desire to get a 
large yield of rich milk, give your cow, three times a day, 
water slightly warmed, slightly salted, in which bran has been 
stirred at the rate of one quart to two gallons of water. You 
will find, if you have not tried this daily practice, that your 
cow will give twenty-five per cent more, immediately under 
the efiect of it, and she will become so attached to the diet as 
to refuse to drink clear water, unless very thirsty ; but this 
mess she will drink almost any time, and * ask for more.* 
The amount of this drink necessary is an ordinary water pail- 
ful each time, noon and night. Four hundred pounds of but- 
ter are often obtained from good stock, and instances are men- 
tioned where the yield is often at a higher figure."

741 Useful Notes. 

To remove paint splashed upon the window panes use a hot 
solution of soda and rub with soft flannel. 

Raw potato will take rust off steel. 

A hot shovel held over varnished furniture will take out 
white spots. So will rubbing with a soft cloth wet in spirits 
of camphor, followed by another dipped in a mixture of sweet 
oil and turpentine to restore the polish. 

A cement made of gum shellac one part, and aqua ammonia 
ten parts, will cement rubber. 

A good cement for marble may be made by melting and 
stirring together one part of white wax and eight parts of 
resin, and then adding four parts of plaster of Paris. It 
should be used while hot. 

The reason lamp chimneys so often crack is because they 
are not properly annealed. If, before using, the chimney is 
placed in a kettle of cold water, and the water gradually 
brought to the boiling point, and the chimney removed after 
the water has cooled again, it will be far less likely to crack. 
Other articles of glass may be tempered in the same way. 



THE COMPLEXION. 257 



THE COMPLEXION. 



It has come to be the custom to put in all receipt books 
some absurdity as " a face wash." We tested several of these 
and found them flat failures in every particular. We there- 
fore offer a few hints on the care of the skin. AVash the face 
thoroughly in warm and even very hot water, using a French 
soap called Sue du Laitu or a paste called Pate d'Amande 
au Miel, both of these are nicely made by the Parisien per- 
fumer Violet, and are simply designed to give a fine grain and 
good color to the skin. We also give a receipt for a glycerine 
lotion that we know to be very nice indeed. 

742 For Eemoving Sun Burn and Tan. 

A famous preparation for removing sun burn and tan is 
very simple yet excellent, and is composed of equal parts of 
lemon juice and white of egg beaten together in an earthen 
pot, set over a slow fire, and stirred with a wooden spoon until 
it acquires the consistency of soft pomatum. If the face is 
well washed with rice water before it is applied, it will remove 
freckles and give brilliancy to the complexion. Cold water 
and coarse towels will make the skin, in time, harsh and 
wrinkled ; water for the face and hands must be tepid and 
the towels soft and fine. 

743 Another Neoessary to the Toilette 

Is so simple and cheap that it comes within the reach of 
every one. It is now found upon the wash-stands of the most 
fashionable women of New York, Washington and Philadel- 
phia, in a little jar or toilette tumbler, it has a milky hue, 
and is called oatmeal ! 
17 



258 THE COMPLEXION. 

A handful of oatmeal at a time saturated with water until 
it assumes the color of milk is deemed indispensable. It 
washes the skin inexpressibly fine, soft, and smooth, both of 
face and hands, this is the liquid. The soaked oatmeal is so 
glutinous that it is far superior to soap where the best cannot 
be had. 

744 Care of the Hair. 

The Spanish and Cuban women are far-famed for the 
luxuriant growth and beauty of their hair, and the secret of 
its culture was told me by a Cuban friend. Every month the 
head is thoroughly shampooed with the yolk of a well-beaten 
egg ; the cleansing properties are wonderful. Then this rather 
unpleasant stickiness is removed by the hair and head being 
carefully washed in a basin of tepid water to which is added 
a, teaspoonful of ammonia and a pinch of powdered borax. 

745 Glycerine Lotion. 

Three ounces of glycerine, ten drachms of mucilage of, 
quince, five grains of pulverized cochineal, one and a half 
ounces of hot water, two and one-half ounces of deodorized 
alcohol, eight drops of oil of rose, half a drachm of pulverized 
gum arable, eight ounces of water. 

Rub the powdered cochineal first, with the hot water gradu- 
ally added, and then add the alcohol ; then triturate the oil 
of rose well with the powdered gum arable, and gradually 
add the water, as in making emulsion. With this mix well 
the solution first formed, and filter, and to the filtered liquid 
add the glycerine and mucilage of quince seeds, and shake 
well. 

The mucilage of quince seeds fchould always be freshly 
made. If the alcohol is sweet and free from foreign odor, and 
the glycerine perfectly inodorous, a less quantity of oil of 
roses may suffice.

If care is taken in its manufacture this will form a beautiful 
and elegant preparation, with a rich, rosy fragrance. 

When applied to the skin it imparts an agreeably soft, 
smooth and velvety feel. It is an excellent application for the 
face after shaving. 

I have tried many similar combinations, but have never 
found an article that has been so generally admired and so 
universally popular as this. 

746 Bed Lip Salve. 

Oil of sweet almonds, two ounces ; pure olive oil, six 
ounces; spermaceti, one and one-half ounces; white w^ax, 
one ounce. Color with carmine and perfume with oil of roses. 

747 To Remove Milk Crust from an Infant's Head, 

Moisten well with raw" linseed oil. Put on an oil skin cap, 
fitting close to the head to exclude the air. 

748 An Ugly but Sure Cure for Chilblains. 

Take a saucer of kerosene oil and add a handful of salt, 
mix thoroughly and apply to chilblains; then heat the chil- 
blains at a very hot fire ; when the heat becomes unbearable 
^*grit" your teeth and bear a little longer; as soon as the 
pain subsides a little repeat the operation. Do this three or 
four times. This is quite painful, but is a sure cure. I tried 
it six years ago on the worst assortment of chilblains I ever saw. 

749 Good for the Teeth. 

To preserve the teeth, dissolve two ounces of borax in three 
pints of boiling water, and before it is cold add one table- 
spoonful of spirits of camphor, and bottle for use. A table- 
spoonful of this, mixed with an equal quantity ot* tepid water, 
and applied daily with a soft brush, will preserve the teeth, 
extirpate all tartarous adhesion, arrest decay, and make the 
teeth pearly white.

750 Racahaut. 

One pound of rice flour, one pound of chocolate, grated 
fine, two tablespoonfuls of arrowroot, from a half pound to 
a pound of sugar. Mix well together and put in a close jar. 
To one quart of milk rub in four dessertspoonfuls of the above 
mixture. Give it a boil up and season with vanilla. 

751 Cream Soda. 

Dissolve two pounds of loaf sugar and a half ounce of 
tartaric acid in one quart of cold water. Beat whites of two 
eggs to a stiff* froth and stir into them a tablespoonful of flour ; 
add the sugar, acid and water, then pour into a kettle and 
boil three minutes ; strain, let it cool, and bottle. Two table- 
spoonfuls of the mixture with half a teaspoonful of soda, in a

754 Plum Broth. 

Put a cup of raisins in a quart of water, and boil hard for 
half an hour. Mix two tablespoonfuls of oatmeal with a 
little cold water and salt, and stir it in with the raisins. Let 
it boil up and skim it well, and then boil twenty minutes or 
half an hour. Sweeten with white sugar and add a little nut- 
meg. This is very nourishing. 

'755 Beef Tea for the Sick. 

One pound of beef steak, free from fat. Grill on both 
sides till white, and then chop fine; put in a bowl, pour 
over it one pint cold water and let it stand an hour; 
season to taste, put all in a saucepan and boil twenty minutes. 
Chicken prepared in same way is good, and mutton thus pre- 
pared is especially good for teething children when the bowels 
are affected. As the patient gets better, rice can be added to 
the soup, and thyme or parsley, and pepper. This is much 
less trouble and far nicer than the old way of making beef 
tea in a bottle and cooking for hours. 

756 Essence of Beef. 

Is quite 'different from beef tea, and is made by packing 
the chopped beef in a Hero or Mason preserve jar or a bottle, 
and lightly covering or corking the vessel ; place it in a pot 
of cold water and let it come to a boil and continue to cook 
till the meat which was placed without water in the jar is so 
dissolved as to produce a teacup or more of liquid ; this is 
much stronger than beef tea, but not nearly as digestible.

757 How to Make a Mustard Poultice. 

A mustard poultice should never make a blister at all. If 
a blister is wanted, there are other plasters far better than 
mustard for the purpose. When you make a mustard plaster, 
then, use no water whatever, but mix the mustard with the 
white of an egg, and the result will be a plaster that will 
" draw *' perfectly, but will not produce a blister, even upon 
the skin of an iufant, no matter how long it is allowed to 
remain upon the part. For this, says the Household, wc have 
the word of an old and eminent physician, as well as our 
experience.

758 A Cure for the Diphtheria. 

Dr. Field, of Victoria, used powdered sulphur and a quill. 
He put a teaspoonful of flour of brimstone into a wine-glass 
of water and stirred it with his finger instead of a spoon, as 
the sulphur does not readily amalgamate with water. When 
the sulphur was well mixed he gave it as a gargle, and in ten 
minutes the patient was out of danger. Brimstone kills every 
species of fungus in man, beast and plant in a very few min- 
utes. Instead of spitting out gargle, he recommended the 
swallowing of it. In extreme cases, when the fungus was too 
nearly closing the throat to allow the gargle, he blew the 
sulphur through a quill into the throat, and after the fungus 
had shrunk to allow of it, then the gargling. 

If the patient cannot gargle, take a live coal, put it on a 
shovel and sprinkle a spoonful or two of flour of brimstone 
at a time upon it ; let the sufferer inhale it, holding the head 
over it, and the fungus will die. If plentifully used, the 
whole room may be filled almost to suflTocation, and the patient 
can walk about in it, inhaling the fumes, with doors and win- 
dows closed. 

759 Sulphur in Scarlet Pever. 

Thoroughly anoint the patient twice daily with sulphur 
ointment ; give five to tens grains of sulphur in a little jam 
three times a day. Sufficient sulphur was burned twice daily 
(on coals on a shovel) to fill the room with the fumes, and of 
course was thoroughly inhaled by the patient. Under this

mode of treatment each case improved immediately, and none 
were over eight days in making a complete recovery, and I 
firmly believe in each it was prevented from spreading by the 
treatment adopted. One case was in a large school. Having 
had a large experience in scarlet fever last year and this, I 
feel some confidence in my own judgment, and I am of opin- 
ion that the very mildest cases I ever saw do not do half so 
well as bad cases do by the sulphur treatment, and as far as I 
can judge, sulphur is as near a specific for scarlet fever as 
possible. — Dr. Henry Pigeoriy in London Lancet. 

760 To Cure Croup. 

Croup can often be cured by alum and sugar. Take a 
knife or grater, and shave off*, in small particles, about a tea- 
spoonful of alum ; then mix with about twdce its quantity of 
sugar to make it palatable, and administer it as quickly as 
possible. Almost instantaneous relief will follow. 

761 A Remedy for Croup. 

Let a healthy person fill his lungs with pure air; then 
slowly breathe upon the patient's throat and chest, commenc- 
ing at the point of the chin and moving slow^ly down to the 
bottom of the windpipe. Repeat for a few minutes and it 
will give relief in cases where all other means fail. 

My boy was always subject to croup ; came near dying with 
the rattling, noisy kind at about eleven months old. I saved 
him with fomentations of warm water, and ever after pre- 
vented a serious attack by watchfulness and water. But when 
three years old, I let him play in the brook one warm rainy 
day, and he took a severe cold and had the still kind of croup, 
the first and last time he ever had it. In spite of all I could 
do, he grew constantly worse until he could only gasp and 
breathe with his head thrown back. We thought his last

moments had come, when I thought of and applied Bronson's 
remedy for a minute. When I stopped he looked up and 
said, "Do so again, mother, do," though he could not speak 
when I began. You may be assured I did so again, and I 
believe it saved his life. 

762 Mothers' Milk. 

The bruised leaves of the castor oil plant will cause the 
mother's milk to return by laying it upon the breast. It is 
worth trying. 

T63 To Stop the Bleeding of Wounds. 

A piece of an enameled card, used as a court plaster, will 
almost always stanch bleeding. 

764 To Cure Corns. 

Apply young peach leaves, bruised and moistened, on the 
corns every night until relieved. This remedy can only be 
used from May till November, but it is so excellent that we 
advise our readers to cure their corns during those months. 

765 Soda Mint. 

Bicarb, soda (Eng.), one drachm ; pure water, three ounces ; 
spearmint water, four ounces ; glycerine, one ounce ; ar. spts.

767 Flaxseed Syrup. 

This excellent remedy for a cough is made thus: boil one 
ounce of flaxseed in a quart of water for half an hour; strain 
and add to the liquid, the juice of two lemons, and half a 
pound of rock candy. If the cough is accompanied with 
weakness and loss of appetite, add half an ounce of powdered 
gum arabic. Set this to simmer for half an hour, stirring 
occasionally. Take a wineglass of it when the cough is 
troublesome. 

768 Chronic Diarrhea.* 

A teaspoonful of wheat flour mixed into a cup of sweet 
milk, with a little nutmeg grated into it. Take it cold and 
raw. Beat it well, so that it foams. To be taken three or 
four times a day. 

769 Por Neuralgia and Headache. 

Alcohol, one ounce ; laudanum, one-eighth ounce ; chloro- 
form, five-eighths ounce; gum camphor, one-half ounce; oil 
cloves, one-half drachm; oil lavendar, one drachm ; sulphuric 
ether, three-quarters drachm ; rub the part affected and 
inhale the liniment. It is also a good thing for sick head- 
ache; by rubbing the forehead with the liniment, and inhaling 
the same the pain is relieved. 

770 Senna rigs. 

Take four ounces of senna and infuse it two hours in one 
pint of boiling water. Strain this liquor over one pound of 
fresh figs or prunes with a handful of loaf sugar ; let the 
prunes stew till well cooked, soft and pulpy ; then put them 
into a jar for use. Eat one or two at night when retiring or 
oftener through the day if the bowels are very sluggish. 



268 SPECIFICS AND REMEDIES. 

771 For Burns. 

Procure from a tallow chandler a few ounces of palm oil, 
which is a brownish yellow substance the consistency of lard ; 
spread it on a cloth and apply to the burn. Should the face 
or eyes have been burned, paint the oil on with a camel's hair 
brush every hour. The effect is almost miraculous. By the 
use of it a terrific gunpowder burn was cured in six days 
without the sign of a scar. 

772 Relief for Scalds. 

Apply a layer of common salt and saturate it with laud,a- 
num ; hold it in position a few hours with a simple wrapper. 
The smarting will disappear almost immediately. This acted 
like magic on a burn produced by scalding tea. 

773 Toothache, 

According to the London Lancet, can be cured by the follow- 
ing preparation of carbolic acid : To one drachm of collo- 
dium add two drachms of Calvert's carbolic acid. A gela- 
tinous mass is precipitated, a small portion of which, inserted 
in the cavity of an aching tooth, invariably gives immediate 
relief. 

774 Antidote for Poison. 

A poison of any conceivable description and degree of 
potency, which has been swallowed intentionally or by acci- 
dent, may be rendered almost instantaneously harmless by 
swallowing two gills of sweet oil. An individual with a very 
strong constitution should take twice the quantity. The oil 
will neutralize every form of vegetable or mineral poison 
with which physicians are acquainted.

775 For an Overdose of Chloroform. 

A curious means of reviving patients who are in danger of 
death from chloroform is brought out by the recent fatal 
accident in Boston. It reverses the sentence " to be hung by 
the neck until you are dead," and declares that a man must 
be hung by the heels until he isn't dead — to provide the needed 
supply of blood for the head. 

776 Tor Piles or Sore Nipples. 

Take the leaves of sweet clover (the tall garden flower) when 
they are in milk ; pick them and put them into an iron vessel 
with thick sweet cream ; let all simmer or boil gently, without 
burning, until you can pour ofl* a clear green oil ; this, when 
it cools, hardens into a salve, which can be inserted into the 
rectum. — Mrs. Merrick, 

Stranninum prepared in the same way is also recom- 
mended. 

The sweet clover makes a delightful salve by boiling it in 
the very best sweet oil, and adding to each cupful of the 
strained oil half an ounce of bees-wax.

'777 To Hasten Cooking. 

All kinds of poultry and meat can be cooked quicker by 
adding to the water in which they are boiled a little vinegar 
or a little piece of lemon. By the use of an acid, there will be 
considerable saving of fuel as well as shortening of time. Its 
action is beneficial on old tough meats, rendering them quite 
tender and easy to be digested. 

778 To Keep Meat Fresh. 

Here is a Japanese recipe for keeping meat fresh in hot 
weather: "Place it in a clean porcelain bowl and pour very 
hot water over it, so as to cover it. Then pour oil on the 
water. The air is thus quite excluded, and the meat is pre- 
served." 

779 To Preserve Eggs. 

Roll each egg in thin paper ; put the small end down into a 
peach basket or crate, that will admit of ventilation ; set in a 
cool place where they will not freeze, and they will keep all 
winter. 

780 To Sweep a Carpet. 

Peel and wash four large potatoes ; put them in a chopping 
bowl and chop into pieces the size of a pea ; sprinkle them 
over the floor, brush them well over the carpet with your 
broom, and then sweep thoroughly. After using this you will 
forever discard salt, tea leaves, corn meal, etc.

781 The Uses of the Lemon. 

As a writer in the Loudon Lancet remarks, few people know 
tlie value of lemon juice. A piece of lemon bound upon a 
corn will cure it in a few days; it should be renewed night 
and morning. A free use of lemon juice and sugar will always 
relieve a cough. Most people feel poorly in the spring, but if 
they would eat a lemon before breakfast every day for a week 
— with or without sugar, as they like it — they would find it 
better than any medicine. Lemon juice used according to this 
recipe will sometimes cure consumption : Put a dozen lemons 
into cold water, and slowly bring to a boil ; boil slowly until 
the lemons are soft, then squeeze until all the juice is extracted, 
add sugar to your taste and drink. In this way use one 
dozen lemons a day. After using six dozen the patient will 
begin to gain flesh and enjoy food. 

782 Milk as a Diet, Its Effect. 

The NeAV York Commercial Advertiser has some very sen- 
sible ideas on this subject, from which we quote the following : 
" Milk, diluted with with one-third lime water, it is said, will 
not cause any one biliousness, and, if taken regularly, will so 
strengthen the stomach as to banish these disorders. It may 
be taken with acid of some kind when it does not easily digest. 
The idea that milk must not be eaten with pickles is not an intel- 
ligent one, as milk curdles in the stomach nearly as soon as it 
is swallowed. AVhen milk is constipating, as it is frequently 
found to be by persons w^ho drink freely of it in the country 
in the summer time, a little salt i^prinkled in each glassful will 
prevent the difficulty. As milk is so essential to the health 
of our bodies, it is well to consider when to take it, and how. 
It is a mistake to drink milk between meals, or with food at 
the table. In the former case it will destroy the appetite ; and 



272 MISCELLANEOUS. 

in the latter it is never proper to drink anything. After 
finishing each meal a goblet of pure milk should be drunk ; 
and if any one wishes to grow fleshy, a pint taken before 
retiring at night will soon cover the scrawniest bones. In cases 
of fever and summer complaint, milk is given with excellent 
results. The idea that milk is ' feverish' has long since been 
exploded, and it is now the physician's great reliance in 
bringing through typhoid patients, or those in too low a state 
to be nourished by solid food." 

783 Milk and Lime-Water. 

Milk and lime-water are now frequently prescribed by phy- 
sicians in cases of dyspepsia and weakness of the stomach. 
Often when the functions of digestion and assimilation have 
been seriously impaired, a diet of bread, milk and lime-water 
will give relief. The way to make lime-water is simply to 
procure a few lumps of unslacked lime, put the lime in a stone 
jar, add water until the lime is slacked and about the consis- 
tency of thin cream; the lime settles, leaving the pure and 
clear lirae-water at the top. Three or four tablespooufuls of it 
may be added to a goblet of milk. 

784 Effect of Camphor on Seeds. 

A Berlin professor appears to have established the fact that 
a solution of camphor stimulates vegetables, as alcohol does 
animals. He took seeds of various sorts, some being three or 
four years old, and possessing a slight degree of vitality, and 
placed them between sheets of blotting paper. Some of these 
he wetted with pure water, and others with camphorated 
water. In many cases the seeds did not swell at all under the 
influence of the simple moisture, but in every case they germi- 
nated where they were subjected to the camphor solution. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 273 

The experiment was extended to different kinds 'of garden 
seeds, old and new, and always with the result of showing a 
singular awakening of dormant vitalism and a wonderful 
quickening of growth. It also appears from the professor's 
researches that the young plants thus stimulated continued to 
increase with a vigor and vivacity much beyond that of those 
which were not so treated. 

T85 To Destroy Weeds in Walks. 

A remedy for weeds growing up between the brick in walks : 
Water, ten gallons ; stone lime, twenty pounds ; flour of 
sulphur, two pounds. Boil in an iron kettle, and when it has 
settled pour the clear water on the weeds. 

786 Wash for Eose Bushes. 

Steep a cup of soot in two quarts of water, and water them 
with it now and then, much to their benefit. If they are 
sickly, and leaves yellow and dropping off, wash the plants in 
soap suds, rinse in soft water and give them a little soot tea 
once a week. For out of door rose bushes I scatter the soot 
around the roots and give them all the washing suds conve- 
nient. 

187 To Kill the Eose Slug. 

A good plan is to dust the plant thickly Avith powdered or 
air slaked lime, plaster of Paris, road dust or ashes, and repeat 
as often as may be required ; or the plant may be thoroughly 
sprinkled or washed with a strong suds made of soft soap ; or 
a better remedy, perhaps, is whale oil soap, one pound to eight 
gallons of water is the right strength, or dissolve one table- 
spoonful of powdered white hellebore in two gallons of boiling 
water ; when cold apply to the roses with a whisk broom,

portion of the silvering of the required form, but a little 
larger ; place a drop of mercury upon it ; this spreads, and the 
piece of amalgam may be lifted up with the blade of a knife 
and transferred to the place to be repaired ; press it with a 
piece of cotton wool ; it hardens speedily, and the patch is as 
good as any part of the mirror. 

789 Bouquets. 

When you receive a bouquet, sprinkle it lightly with cold 
water, then put it into a vessel containing some soap suds, 
which nourish the roots and keep the flowers as good as new. 
Take the bouquet out of the suds every morning and lay it 
sideways in fresh water, the stock entering first into the water, 
keep it there a minute or two, then take it out and sprinkle 
the flowers lightly by the hand with pure water. Replace 
the flowers in the soap-suds and they will bloom freshly. 
Keep flowers at night covered with a wet cloth, or set them in 
a cellar or refrigerator. 

790 -To Mend China. 

Take a very thick solution of gum arable in water, and 
stir into it plaster of Paris until the mixture becomes of the 
proper consistency. Apply it with a brush to the fractured 



MISCELLANEOUS. 275 

edges of the china, and stick them together. In three days 
the article cannot be broken in the same place. The white- 
uess of the cement renders it doubly valuable. 

791 A Cheap Fumigator. 

The following will be found to be a cheap and pleasant 
fumigator for sick rooms, diffusing a healthful, agreeable, and 
highly penetrating disinfectant odor in close apartments, or 
wherever the air is deteriorated : 

Pour common vinegar on powdered chalk until efferves- 
cence ceases, leave the w^hole to settle, and pour off the liquid. 
Dry the sediment, and place it in a shallow earthen or glass 
dish, and pour upon it sulphuric acid until white fumes com- 
mence rising. This vapor very quickly spreads, is very agree- 
able, pungent, and acts as a powerful purifier of vitiated air. 

793 To Purify a Sink. 

In hot weather it is almost, impossible to prevent the sinks 
becoming foul, unless some chemical preparation is used. One 
pound of copperas dissolved in four gallons of water, poured 
over a sink three or four times, will completely destroy the 
offensive; odor. As u disinfecting agent, to scatter around 
premises affected with any unpleasant odor, nothing is better 
than a mixture of four parts dry ground plaster of Paris to 
one part of fine charcoal, by weight. All sorts of glass ves- 
sels and other utensils may be effectually purified from offen- 
sive smells by rinsing them with charcoal powder, after the 
grosser impurities have been scoured off with sand and soap. 

793 Indoor "Whitewashing. 

For every sixteen pounds of Paris white (is sold at paint 
stores for three cents per pound), get one-half pound of white 



276 MISCELLANEOUS. 

transparent glue ; cover the glue with cold water at night, 
and in the morning heat it, without scorching, till dissolved. 
Stir in the Paris white with hot water to give it a milky con- 
sistency. Then add and mix well the glue. Apply with a 
common lime whitewash brush. A single coating will do, 
except on very dingy walls. It is almost as brilliant as zinc 
white. 

794 To Repair Walls. 

White walls can be easily repaired without sending for the 
mason. Equal parts of plaster of Paris and white sand — 
such as is used in most families for scouring purposes — mixed 
with water to a paste, applied immediately and smoothed with 
a knife or flat piece of wood, will make the broken place as 
good as new. As the mixture hardens very quickly, it is 
best to prepare but a small quantity at a time. 

795 To Extinguish Kerosene Flames. 

One of the most ready means is to throw a cloth of some 
kind over the flames, and thus stifle them ; but as the cloth is 
not always convenient to the kitchen, where such accidents are 
most likely to occur, some one recommends flour as a substi- 
tute, which, it is said, promptly extinguishes the flames. It 
rapidly absorbs the fluid, deadens the flames, and can be 
readily gathered up and thrown out of doors when the fire is 
extinguished. 

796 Indelible Ink. 

Use a quill pen with this ink, which is first rate. Half a 
stick of lunar caustic or nitrate of silver dissolved in a bottle, 
with one large spoonful of pure, strong vinegar. Hang the 
bottle in the sun, shaking two or three times a day. In two 



MISCELLANEOUS. 277 

weeks it will be found to be better than any ink that can be 
bought for marking with a pen, but it is too thin to use with 
a stencil. It is inexpensive, too, and some of the finest and 
most artistic specimens of linen marking we ever have seen 
were done with this ink. It grows black, instead of fading 
with time. 



797 Paste That Will Keep Well. 

A perpetual paste can be made by dissolving one ounce of 
alum in a quart of warm water, in which a dozen cloves have 
been well boiled ; when cold, add flour enough to make it the 
consistency of cream ; then stir into it half a teaspoonful of 
powdered resin. Boil it to a proper consistency, stirring all 
the time. Strain it hot through a thin muslin cloth. It will 
keep for twelve months, and when dry may be softened with 
water. 

798 Mucilage Which Always Keeps Pure. 

One pound of gum arable dissolved in one pint of boiling 
water ; add a piece of borax the size of a walnut ; bottle in a 
large-mouthed bottle ; shake up three or four days after it is 
made. One tablespoonful of alcohol will prevent mold. 

799 Burnt Almonds (for dessert). 

Blanch and dry half a pound of almonds, put a bit of bat- 
ter the size of a nutmeg into your tin dripping pan, set them 
in your oven and brown as you would coffee, only a very light 
brown. As you take them up give them a light dash of salt ; 
serve cold with figs or raisins. 



278 MISCELLANEOUS. 

800 Quick Puff Pudding. 

Stir one pint of flour, in which is mixed two teaspoonfuls 
of baking powder and a little salt, into milk until very 
soft, place in the steamer well greased cups, put in each a 
spoonful of batter then one of berries, steamed apples or 
peaches, or raisins, cover with anothor spoonful of batter and 
steam twenty minutes. This pudding is delicious made with 
fresh strawberries and eaten with a sauce made of two eggs, 
half a cup of butter, and a cup of sugar beaten tjioroughly 
with a cup of boiling milk, and one of strawberries. 

801 Delicate Pruit Cake. 

Whites of five eggs, three-fourths of a cup of butter, two 
cups of sugar, one cup of milk, two and one-half cups of 
flour, three teaspoonfuls of baking powder, flavor with vanilla. 
Ordinary jelly cake tins are not deep enough for this cake. 
For the fruit cake two large baking spoons of this batter, 
one-half cup of chopped raisins, one-third of a cup of cur- 
rants or citron, one-half cup of flour; put a teaspoonful of 
extract of nectarine in your cup, and molasses enough to half 
fill it, one teaspoon of mace, cinnamon and cloves mixed. 
Bake in three deep jelly tins, two white, one dark ; put together 
with jelly, the dark cake in the middle. 



BILLS OF FARE. 27^ 



BILLS OF FARE. 



Of the small annoyances of the housekeeper there is none per- 
haps more worrying than the ever-occurring question " What 
shall we have for dinner ? " No matter how full the larder, 
the inventive genius of the household head is often puzzled to 
contrive and prepare a nice and varied dinner for every day 
in the week. 

To a young wife and housekeeper who is inexperienced in 
all these matters, though furnished with the most compre- 
hensive and complete cook books, the directions are often too 
elaborate, too rich or too expensive for her taste or that of 
her family, whose health and comfort are to a large extent 
committed to her charge. 

With a large amount of interest and sympathy for such 
puzzled and perplexed friends, we herewith add a few hints 
in the shape of " Bills of Fare," nutritious and sufficiently 
elaborate to suit the wants of a large family or a small one 
with half a dozen guests added, and which, if not within the 
reach of all, can be modified to suit the taste and purse.

ALLOWANCE OF SUPPLIES FOR AN ENTER- 
TAINMENT. 



In invitiug guests, it is safe to calculate that out of one 
hundred and fifty guests but two-thirds of that number will 
be present. If five hundred are invited, not more than three 
hundred can be reckoned on as accepting, many invitations to 
so large a company being in a measure perfunctory and 
decliued in the same spirit. 

Allow one quart of oysters to every three persons present; 
five chickens, and fifteen or twenty heads of celery (or what 
is better, a ten-pound turkey, boiled and cut), are enough 
for chicken salad fur fifty guests ; one gallon of ice cream to 
every twenty guests; one hundred and thirty sandwiches for 
one hundred guests ; six to ten quarts of jelly for a hundred.
