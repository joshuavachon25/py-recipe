PREFACE. 



The following lectures were delivered in the ^'Farmers Lecture 
Course,'' at the College of Agriculture, Minneapolis, during the 
session of 1884. The topics selected at previous sessions had 
been such as to especially interest the male members of the large 
classes in attendance, and it was considered no more than fair 
to the women of the State that attention should be given to such 
matters as would aid them in the conduct of home duties. In- 
fluenced by this desire, I secured the services of Miss Juliet Cor- 
son, the superintendent of the New York School of Cookery, and 
so widely known wherever the English language is spoken, by 
her publications and writings upon all topics relating to domes- 
ti(i economy. The interest manifested in this course of lectures 
by the ladies of Minnesota was shown by the crowded audiences 
present at each exercise, nearly 1,200 of whom registered their 
names and addresses, a list of which is appended to this re- 
port. 

The lectures were familiar, extemporaneous discourses upon 
the topics under discussion, and the lecturer was surrounded by 
all the appointments of a well-ordered kitchen. The dishes as 
prepared were passed to the audience for examination and criti- 
cism, and full opportunity allowed for discussion. This state- 
ment is necessary to explain the colloquial character of the dis- 
courses. 

In placing these lectures before the public the editor does but 
simple justice to Miss Corson in stating that circumstances have 
prevented the preparation by her of a finished report, and have 
compelled the publication of the notes taken af the ^'cooking 
lessons." But if the form of the instruction is devoid of rhetor- 
ical style, the editor guarantees ?ts accuracy. 

Although Miss Corson is a steadj^ worker, her usefulness is 
curtailed by serious illness. In this instance, therefore, indulg- 
ence is claimed for the method. Whatever graces of literature 
the reader seeks, may be found in the author's other published 
works; here the public is entreated to accept a very plain rec- 
ord of the work done at the State University by Miss Corson.

4 BIENNIAL REPORT 

A word of explanation is due to the members of the class, who 
were promised copies of these lectures. I had full reports taken 
at the time, by a stenographer. They were written out shortly 
ufter, and sent to Miss Carson, as by her request, for review; 
but owing to her protracted and nearly fatal illness and very 
slow recovery, these notes have only recently been returned to me. 
I hope this statement will relieve me from any charges of neglect, 
which the ladies might otherwise be disposed to make.

INTEODUCTION. 



This course of lectures is designed to meet the wants of two 
classes of persons: 

First — Those who are experienced housekeepers, familiar 
with the principles and practice of cookery, but who desire in- 
formation concerning the preparation of the finer dishes of the 
modern school. 

Second — The young ladies in attendance at the University and 
others like them, who have had their time and attention so en- 
grossed with studies and other duties that they have not had 
the opportunity to qualify themselves in this most important 
branch of a woman's education. 

To meet the wants of the first class, the morning exercises 
will be devoted to the preparation of palatable and nutritious 
dishes, suitable for every day use in families of moderate means, 
and some of the finer dishes will be introduced. 

As the afternoons are the only times at which the young 
ladies of the University can be present, these sessions will be de- 
voted to practical illustrations of the elementary principles of 
household management and cookery. As time permits, some of 
the salient points in the chemistry of food and the physiology 
of nutrition will be briefly discussed.

UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA. 



FIRST LECTURE. 

Our lesson this morning, ladies, will consist of the preparation 
of what is called soup stock, or beef broth, which is the basis of 
many kinds of soup; it is very easily made, simple in its compo- 
sition, and exceedingly nutritious; the other dishes to be made 
are boiled salmon with cream sauce; potatoes, stewed in butter ; 
and quail, boned and broiled. I give you the boned quail to 
show you what an exceedingly simple operation boning is. It 
is supposed to be very difficult, and it is done sometimes in curi- 
ous ways; but the best way is the simplest and easiest. If we 
have time we will prepare a few omelettes. 

As I shall begin with soup stock, you* will take your receipt 
for that. For each quart of soup stock or broth which you in- 
tend to make, use one pound of meat and bone. By that I mean 
meat and bone weighed together. The cut which I have here 
is from the upper part of the leg, next to the round. You can 
use any cut of the leg, the shank, which is the lower part of the 
leg, or the neck; any of the cheaper parts of meat^will answer 
for soup meat. First, cut the meat from the bone; the butcher 
will always do that for you; then have the bone broken in small 
pieces. The butcher, of course, will do that very much more 
easily than you can do it. Do not wash the meat; wipe it all 
over with a towel wet in cold water. Put the bones in the bot- 
tom of the souj) kettle, laying the meat on the bones; then add 
cold water in the proportion of a quart to each pound of 
meat and bones. Set the soup kettle over the fire, and let the 
broth slowly head and boil. As it boils a scum will rise to the 
surface, which is to be removed in case you are preparing stock 
for clear soup. The scum is composed of the blood and the al- 
bumen of the meat, and is only removed for the purpose of 
clarifying the soup. It is nutritious, and for that reason it 
should always be saved. In France, and in kitchens where 
French cooks are employed, this scum is used either in thick 
soup — for instance, in vegetable soup, such as I shall make this 
afternoon — or put into brown sauces or gravies. Remember, it 
is nothing that is to be thrown away; it is to be saved because 
it is both nutritious and savory. It adds flavor and nutriment 



8 BIENNIAL REPORT 

to any dish to which it is added. While the soup meat is being- 
boiled for the first time, prepare the vegetables. For three or 
four pounds of meat, which will make as many quarts of soup, 
use one medium-size carrot, which is to be scraped, a turnip, 
which is to be peeled, and an onion, which is also to be peeled, 
in such a way as to prevent breaking apart; take off the outer 
dry skin of the onion without trimming it closely; do not cut it 
off at the top, because in that way you will cause the [layers to- 
break apart. After the onion is peeled stick a dozen whole 
cloves into it. The cloves are added to the soup for the purpose 
of flavoring it. You very often hear the remark made that the 
cookery of certain people has an indefinable taste, exceedingly 
nice, but something that you do not exactly understand. It is- 
always produced by a combination of seasonings and flavorings. 
In this soup I shall use for seasoning not only the cloves in the 
onions, but a dozen peppercorns — that is, unground grains of 
pepper, instead of ground pepper, because I want the soup to 
be perfectly clear. I shall use also bay leaves, which may be 
new to some of you; they are the dried leaves of the laurel or 
bay tree, and can be bought at any drug store. You can buy 
five cents' worth of them and they will last you a year or more. 
The seasoning is slightly aromatic; for four quarts of soup use 
only a little leaf, or a piece of a large leaf; use also a blade of 
mace, and a sprig of any dried herb except sage. 

The peppercorns, the bay leaf, the blade of mace, and the 
sprig of sweet herb are tied in the midst of a little bunch of 
parsley, the stalk with all the leaves on, and if it is ever marketed 
here with the root on, use that as well; the root of the parsley has^ 
all the flavor of the leaf intensified, and you have only ta 
thoroughly wish it, and then use it. All these dried herbs are 
to be gathered inside of the parsley and tied in a little bunch; 
tie the parsley by winding string around it, inclosing all the 
dried herbs; this little bunch is called in cooking books a fagot 
or bouquet of herbs; it is what gives soups and sauces that in- 
definable spicy, delicate flavor so much liked. 

After the soup stock boils remove whatever scum has risen,, 
put in the fagot, the turnip, the carrot, the onion stuck with 
cloves, and for the four quarts of soup a heaping tablespoonful 
of salt. Keep the soup stock covered as much as possible while 
it is heating; and after you have put in the vegetables keep ifc 
covered all the time. Let it boil very slowly. * After all the 
vegetables are in set the kettle back so that the heat of the fire 



UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA. 9" 

strikes from one side; let it boil from one side and gently; in 
that way you begin the clarifying. You will find if you boil the 
stock from one side, and very gently, then when you strain it 
after it is done it already will be as clear as most clear soup. 
After it has been strained, to-morrow, we shall clarify it in or- 
der to show the process, which is very simple. Then it will be 
what is called on hotel bills of fare clear soup. 

After the vegetables have been added let the stock boil for at 
least two hours. In that length of time the flavor of the vege- 
tables and the nourishment from the meat will be extracted, but 
not the gelatine from the bones. It is the gelatine in the bones 
which makes broth or stock jelly when it is cold; in order to 
extract the gelatine it is necessary to boil the soup meat and 
bones at least five hours. The soup can be strained at the end 
of two hours, or boiled five or six hours, keeping it covered so 
that none of it wastes or evaporates. When the soup is boiled, 
strain it ; use an earthen bowl or jar; set a colander in it, and 
lay a towel folded twice in the colander, having the colander 
either over the bowl or jar ; pour the soup into the towel, and 
let it run through without squeezing, because if you squeeze the 
towel you will force small particles of scum through, and thils 
cloud the soup. After the soup has run through the towel let it 
cool; do not cover it while it is cooling unless you are afraid of 
flies or insects getting into it; in that case cover it with a sieve. 
If you cover it with a solid earthen cover or plate the steam 
arising from the soup will condense on the under part of the 
cover and fall back into the soup ; if the weather is warm, or if 
it is a close, rainy day, the steam condensed falling back into the 
warm soup will cause it to sour. For this reason when you put 
away a dish of meat or vegetables after dinner do not cover them 
until they are cold. 

BOILED SALMON WITH CREAM SAUCE. 

In boiling a whole fish, or a large piece, use cold water. If 
you put a large piece of fish into boiling water, the outside will 
be cooked before it is done near the bone. Nothing is more dis- 
agreeable than a piece of fish half raw at the bone; it is uneat- 
able. For a small piece of fish, such as I have here, use boiling 
salted water enough to cover it, and boil it until the flakes begin 
to separate, or until, by testing a fin, you can easily pull it out. 
That will -probably be, if you use cold water, soon after the. 
2 



10 BIENNIAL KEPORT 

water boils; if you put the fish into boiling water, it may be five 
or more minutes. Boil the fish, whether it is large or small, un- 
til you can pull out a fin, or until the flakes separate. Then 
drain it, and serve it with any nice sauce. To-day I will make 
a very simple one — cream sauce. Of course you would always 
make the sauce while you were boiling the fish, taking care to 
have both done at the same time. For a pint of sauce, use a 
heaping tablespoonful of butter and a tablespoonful of flour; 
put them in a saucepan over the fire, and stir them together un- 
til they are smoothly mixed; then begin to add hot milk, half a 
cupful at a time; when the first half cupful of milk is stirred in, 
put in another half cupful and again stir until it is smooth; con- 
tinue to add milk until you have used a pint, or until the sauce 
is about the consistency of thick cream. There will always be a 
margin there 'for a little discretion, because some flour will 
thicken very much more than others. Flour that is very rich in 
gluten will thicken more than that which has most starch in it. 
But you have there about the right proportions — a tablespoon- 
ful of floor, a tablespoonful of butter, a pint of milk. Add 
more or less milk as is required to make the sauce the consist" 
ency of thick cream, or of a thickness which will coat the spoon; 
that is, if you dip a spoon in and hold it up, the sauce will not 
all run off like water; when all the milk has been used, season 
the sauce with a level teaspoonful of salt and about a quarter of 
a salt spoon of white pepper. I speak of white pepper particu- 
larly because in making a white sauce, if you use the ordinary 
black pepper, the sauce will be full of little black specks. The 
white pepper is quite as cheap, quite as plentiful as the black 
pepper; all the grocers keep it, and its flavor is nicer, rather 
more delicate, scarcely as pungent as the black pepper; there is 
a certain biting, acrid flavor in the black pepper which does not 
exist in the white pepper; the latter contains all the stimulating 
property and all the aromatic flavor. 

After the same is finished, keep it hot by setting the sauce 
pan containing it in a pan of hot water, on the back of the 
stove. A perfectly plain white sauce (which can be made the 
basis of an infinite variety of other sauces) is made by substitut- 
ing water for milk; by leaving out the pepper and salt, and using 
sugar for sweetening, you can make a nice pudding sauce. If 
you add a tablespoonful of chopped parsley to a pint of white 
sauce, you make parsley sauce. Putting a few capers into it, 
makes caper sauce. A teaspoonful of anchovies dissolved in it 



UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA. 11 

makes anchovy saace. It is easily made the basis of a great 
many sauces, the name of which depends on preferred addition 
to the white sauce. Egg sauce is made by adding chopped hard 
boiled eggs to white sauce. 

Question hy a Lady. Would you ever substitute cornstarch 
for flour ? 

Miss Corson. You caa if you wish. You must use your 
own discretion about the quantities. Simply get the thickness 
of thick cream. 

Question. Is it better to use a porcelain vessel, or will tin do? 
Miss Corson, Use any saucepan made of material thick 
enough to prevent burning. 

Question. Do you put the fish right into the water, or have 
you a fish kettle % 

Miss Corson. If you are using a fish kettle you will have a 
little wire frame. You can lay the fish on that, or you can tie 
it up in a cloth, if you wish to. 

Question. Then how can you tell when it is done? 
Miss Corson. If you tie it in a cloth you must leave a little 
space so that you can test it. 

Question. How much pepper did you say to put in the sauce ? 
Miss Corson. About a quarter of a salt spoon; that is, a 
good pinch of pepper. One of the ladies asked me about using 
a thick sauce pan — porcelain-lined sauce pan; you will find the 
advantage of thick sauce pans of all kinds is that they are less 
likely to burn than thin ones. The thinner the metal the sauce 
pan is made of, the more likely it is to burn. There are so many 
different kinds of utensils that every lady can take her own 
choice. Black sauce pans, lined with tin or with porcelain; tin 
sauce pans, thin ones, and thick ones made of block tin. 
You notice that I use copper sauce pans. Coppers are the most 
durable; they are lined with tin, and they have to be relined 
about once a year; the cost of relining is very little — compar- 
atively little; I think it costs me about three cents a foot to have 
them relined, and the copper never wears out. If you buy a 
copper sauce pan you have got something that lasts you all your 
life, and you can leave it as an heirloom; if you don't want to 
do that, you can sell it for old copper for nearly as much as you 
paid for it. In using copper, you must never let them become 
bare on the inside. If the tin wears off and the copper is ex- 
posed to any acid in the food cooked, it is apt to form a poison- 
ous combination. But with proper care and cleanliness, copper 
sauce pans are pefectly safe. 



12 BIENNIAL REPORT 

Question. Do you prefer them to the galvanized iron ! 

Miss Corson. Yes, I do, on the score of cleanliness, economy 
and ease in cooking. 

Question: Do you use a wooden spoon from choice? 

Miss Corson. Yes; of course you can understand, ladies, that 
•I could very soon scrape the tin off of the inside of a sauce pan 
with a metal spoon, a knife, or anything of that sort. Copper 
sauce pans should be cleaned with a rag, a little Sapolio and hot 
water. If they are cleaned as fast as they are used they are no- 
more trouble to keep clean than any other sauce pan. I use in 
stirring simply a small pudding stick — an old-fashioned wooden 
pudding stick. It does not scrape the sauce pans, and there is. 
no danger of uncooked ilour accumulating on the sticks, as it 
does in the bowl of a spoon. If you are stirring with a spoon,, 
some of the half-cooked flour might get in the bowl of the spoon, 
and then your sauce would have the taste of the raw flour. I 
will leave the stick in the sauce pan and pass it about so that 
you caTi see what I mean. Anyone can whittle these little sticks- 
out, using any kind of hard wood. Do not use soft wood. You 
will have noticed, ladies, if you have ever put sauce of this kind, 
thick sauce, to keep hot, it may have grown very much thicker 
by standing; in such case add a little more milk or water, and a. 
little more seasoning when you are ready to use it. 

Question. How do you make perfectly clear sauce? 

Miss Corson. You can make a nearly clear thick sauce by 
using arrow root. Of course, a clear thin sauce is simply sugar 
dissolved in water, with butter or flavoring as you like. 

POTATOES, STEWED IN BUTTER. 

The potatoes are peeled and sliced in rather small slices of 
even size; put them over the fire in enough salted boiling water 
to cover them, boil them until they begin to grow tender; not 
till they break, but just till they begin to grow tender; after the 
potatoes are boiled tender drain them, and suppose you have a ' 
pint bowl fall of potatoes, use about two heaping tablespoon- 
fuls of butter; melt the butter in a scant half cupful of milk. 
When the butter is melted put the potatoes into it, and with a 
spoon lift them very carefully from the bottom, always without 
breaking them, until they have absorbed the milk and butter;; 
then season them with salt and white pepper, and they will be 
ready to serve. Season them palatably; I could not give you 



UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA. 13 

the quantity of seasoning because it would depend upon the 
salt that the potatoes had absorbed from the water. You should 
taste them first before seasoning at all, and then if they need 
any more salt add a very little at a time. If you simply want 
the potatoes nicely stewed you don't add so much butter, a scant 
tablespoonful, and milk enough to moisten them; but this re- 
ceipt is an exceedingly nice one — rather rich, but very nice. 

(At this point the fish was done, and Miss Corson continued.) 

You notice, ladies, that I take off the skin of the fish before 
taking it up. That is very easy; it slips off easily, and without 
it the fish is much nicer to serve at the table. In serving sauce 
with fish you pour some around it, not over it; or you serve the 
fish on a napkin, and the sauce in a dish, as you prefer. If you 
serve the fish in a folded napkin garnish it with a few sprigs of 
parsley, if you can get them, or with a lemon sliced, if you do 
not live — as some unfortunate people do — ^' fifty miles from a 
lemon." Lemons are very nice always with any kind of fish. 
Parsley can be bought here all winter long. I have learned that 
from the advertisements in the papers already; and a little of it 
makes a great difference in the appearence of a dish. 

Question. Can you tell us how we can tell whether a frozen 
fish is stale or fresh % 

Miss Corson. You can after you have thawed it in cold 
water; you can tell by the smell. (Laughter.) The way to thaw 
frozen fish is to put it into perfectly cold water and keep it in a 
-cold place until all the frost is drawn out. Of course the most 
of the fish in this market would be frozen in the winter. This 
one has been frozen. 

Question. Can you tell us how to carve a whole fish ? 

Miss Corson. You would have a rather sharp knife and 
spoon ; a fish knife, though it looks pretty, is not good to serve 
fish with because it is apt to be dull; you want a knife that will 
out down through the fish without tearing it, without attemi)t- 
ing to cut down through the bone, unless you know where the 
joints are located. 

Question. Would you cook a fish with the fins ? 

Miss Corson. The latest, fancy of fish lovers in I^ew York, 
the members of the Ichotyophagus Club, who are supposed to be 
the leaders in the fashions of fish, is to have the fish served with 
the fins, head and tail on ; and with some fish they want even 
the scales ; and then they simply lift off the skin, the entire 
skin, before they begin to serve it. They have the fish thor- 



14 BIENNIAL REPORT 

ougMy washed and drawn, and then cooked with the scales and 
fins on. You can judge how easy it would be to do that, be- 
cause you saw how easily that skin came off this fish. The skin 
comes off easily if the fish is properly cooked — cooked enough. 
Question. What kind of fish can be cooked with the scales on f 
Miss Corson. I think the black bass, and some kinds of sea 
fish. The idea is that if the fish are not scaled they will keep 
their flavor; a fish properly dressed retains enough of its flavor 
even if it is scalded before it is cooked. 

OMELETTES. 

First, I will make a plain breakfast omelette. Use for two or 
three people not more than three eggs. You can not very well 
manage more than three in an ordinary pan. It is better to 
make several omelettes, especially because people are not apt to 
come to the table all at once, and an omelette to be nice must 
be eaten directly it is cooked. Say three eggs;, break them into 
a cup or bowl; add to them a saltspoonful of salt, quarter of a 
saltspoonful of pepper, and mix them just enough to thoroughly 
break the whites and yolks together. Put over the fire a frying 
pan with a heaping teaspoonful of butter in it. Let the butter get 
hot. If you like an omelette brown let the butter begin to brown. 
After pouring the eggs into the hot frying pan break the omelette 
on the bottom of the pan with a fork, just a little, so that you 
let the uncooked part run down on the bottom of the pan. I do 
not mean to stir the omelette as you would scrambled eggs, but 
just break it a little until it is cooked as much as you want it. 
French breakfast omelettes are always cooked so that they are 
slightly juicy in the middle; in order to accomplish that result 
of course you have them still liquid [before you begin to turn 
them. When the omelette is done as much as you want it run a 
fork under one side of it and fold it half over, then fold it again; 
loosen it from the pan; have a platter hot, and turn the omelette 
out. Serve it the moment it is done. 

^ext 1 will make a light omelette. The same rule — three 
eggs, whites and yolks separate; beat the whites to a stiff froth; 
add seasoning to the yolks in the same proportion as before; mix 
the yolks slightly with the seasoning; after the white has been 
beaten quite stiff" and the yolk seasoned, mix them very lightly 
together; have a heaping tablespoonful of butter in the frying 
pan over the fire, hot, just as for the plain omelette; mix the 



UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA. 15- 

whites and the yolks together, without breaking down the white. 
Of course the lightness of the omelette depends on keeping all 
the air in the white of the egg that you have beaten into it. Put 
the eggs into the hot frying pan; run the fork under the ome- 
lette and lift it from the pan as it cooks; lift the cooked portions 
from the pan, and let them fall back on the top of the omelette, 
taking care not to pat the omelette down at all; but just lift the 
cooked portions and let them fall back on the top of the ome- 
lette, until it is done as much as you like. Usually this omelette 
is served soft — as soft as ice cream. When it is done as much 
as you want it, push it to the side of the pan, gently, and then 
turn it out on a hot platter. Always remember that the success 
of an omelette depends upon the quickness with which it is 
made and served; because, in the first place, you make it light 
by beating air into it; then, of course, the heat expands the air, 
and that makes the omelette still lighter; and you must get it 
served before the hot air escapes. 

BONING QUAIL. 

After the quail have been picked, cut the wings off at the first 
joint, cut the legs just above the joint of the drum-stick. Cut 
off the head, take out the crop, cut the quail down the backbone;, 
from the inside, cut the joint where the wing joins the body; 
and having cut that wing joint, begin and cut close to the car- 
cass of the bird till you get down to the leg joint, where the sec- 
ond joint of the leg unites with the body; break that joint, and 
keep on cutting the flesh from the carcass, taking care not to 
cut through the carcass so that you strike the intestines until 
you reach the ridge of the breast bone; close to the breast bone 
you will find that little division in the flesh of the breast which 
you have noticed in carving chickens and turkeys; it is called 
the little filet, and lies close to the breast bone; separate this nat- 
ural division from the outside of the breast. Then beginning 
again on the other side, cut close to the carcass of the bird until 
you have reached the breast, as on the other side. ]N'ow the flesh 
is loose on both sides of the bird, and needs only to be taken off 
without breaking the skin of the breast. You would bone 
chickens and turkeys in the same way. Take the carcass out 
entire. Now take out the wing and leg bones from the inside. 
Do not tear the skin of the bird any more than you can help. 
Kow lay the flesh on the table, with the skin down, and straight- 



16 BIENNIAL REPORT 

en it out a little, distributing the flesh evenly over the skin, and 
it is ready to stuff. If I were making boned turkey I should 
have it all ready, just like this, and then put the force meat in, 
draw the bird up over the force meat, and sew it down the back. 
This bird is simply going to be broiled. Season with salt and 
pepper. In preparing boned birds you can use any kind of 
force meat — a layer of sausage meat, or any kind of chopped 
cold meat; season it with salt and pepper. Put the birds be- 
tween the bars of the wire gridiron, and broil them with a very 
hot fire. The gridiron should be well buttered, so that the birds 
can not stick. By the time the bird is broiled brown on both 
sides it will be done. Of course you do half a dozen or a dozen 
in the same way precisely. Eemember, ladies, always, that to 
broil you should use the hottest fire you can get — the hottest 
and the clearest fire, because part of the success of broiling de- 
pends upon quickly cooking the outside, while the inside of 
anything you are broiling still remains juicy. If you had a 
wood fire you would broil over the fire. If you broil over the 
fire you must expect the blaze to rise, and you must naturally 
suppose the meat will be smoked; but you can make your fire 
dear — that is, have it alive; do not have it smoky and full of 
unburnt wood or coal; have a clear bed of coals if you are going 
to broil over the fire. 

Question. Do you never wash the birds before boiling ? 

Answer. E^o; you will find that I am very i^n-neat about that. 
In the first place, I would not use a piece of meat or a bird of 
any kind that was really dirty enough to need washing. If it 
had anything on it that I could not get off by wiping with a wet 
cloth, I simply wouldn't use it. If you wash meat or poultry 
you destroy a certain amount of its flavoring and take away some 
of its nourishment. 

Question. Sometimes a bird shot will have a great deal of the 
blood settle in the breast or in the flesh. 

Miss Corson. Yes; you want the blood; you want to keep the 
blood there. The blood is a part of the nourishment. The idea 
of washing meat comes from the old Hebrew prohibition which 
involved the removal of every particle of blood. You know that 
the Hebrews believed that the blood was the life and even to th is 
day every particle of blood is taken away from their meat, not 
only by washing after it comes into the house, \ but bt^fore 
that by the treatment it receives from the butcher. The 1)1 ood 
is a part of the nourishment, and you want to keep as much of 



UNIVl^RSITY OF MINNESOTA. 17 

it as you can; in some cooking it forms a very important part; 
for instance, in cooking a hare or rabbit, the blood which es- 
capes in the dressing is saved and used. 

Question. Would you treat prairie chicken, grouse or part- 
ridge in this way % 

Miss Oorson. Yes, in the same way. 

Question. Not if you were going to roast turkey? 

Miss Corson. One of my good friends in this far Northwest 
several years ago sent me a nice recipe for making a fricassee of 
chicken which I will tell you. The recipe said that after the 
chicken was picked you might wash it thoroughly with nice soap, 
then rinse it. (Laughter.) Now if you like you can prepare it 
that way. No, you will find, ladies, that if you use a cloth well 
wet in cold water yoa can remove all objectionable matter from 
the outside of meat or poultry. Indeed, if a piece of meat or 
poultry can not be cleaned with a wet cloth, it is not clean 
enough to use. One lady asks me about keeping meat for a long 
time. Of course that is a question of taste entirely, whether you 
like meat hung a long time or whether you like it fresh. Al 
meat, when it is first killed, whether it is poultry, or game, or 
the ordinary domestic meat, is very tender. It is tender until 
the flesh begins to grow cold, until the animal heat, etc., parts 
from the flesh. Then it beomes tough, rigid and hard, and re- 
mains so until the process of decomposition begins. I do not 
mean until it begins to taint, but until it begins to decompose; 
at that point it begins to grow tender; it is still fresh and good 
enough for food. Remember that the hanging of meat is for the 
purpose of allowing it to begin to decompose. 



LECTURE SECOND. 



Our lesson this afternoon will consist of some plain soups and 
stews of meat. I shall begin with a soup, — of yellow split peas. 
For four quarts of soup use an ordinary cupful of yellow split 
peas; pick them over and wash them in cold water, put them in 
a saucepan or a soap kettle with two quarts of cold water. Set 
the saucepan or soup kettle over the fire and let the water very 
gradually heat. When it boils put in some cold water, — part 
of a cupful, let them boil again; keep on putting in cold water 
every fifteen or twenty minutes, until you have used two quarts 
3 



18 BIENNIAL BEPORT» 

of cold water besides the first two quarts. The object of adding- 
cold water slowly is this: You soften the peas by the gradual 
heating of the cold water. After the first boiling the addition 
of a little cold water lowers the temperature, and as the water 
heats again the peas are gradually softening; so that within an 
hour and a half or two hours you will find them quite tender 
enough. You will notice that I have used no salt; the salt would 
tend to harded the peas. You add salt after the soup is nearly 
finished. The old way of soaking the peas over night is a very 
good one, but this is rather better, for this reason: If you soak 
the peas over night you destroy a small portion of their nutri- 
tive properties; especially if you make the soup in warm water, 
there will be a slight fermentation. The object of soaking them 
over night is simply to soften them, and as you can soften them 
in this way you accomplish the same purpose by adding cold 
water gradually. You will notice that this is for perfectly plain 
pea soup. You can vary it by adding bones of cold ham, or of 
cold roast beef; you can boil the bones with the peas. In that 
way you get the flavor of whatever meat you add. A very nice 
soup is made simply with the peas without any meat, by the ad- 
dition of a fried onion, for that soup you would peel and slice 
an onion and put it in the bottom of the soup kettle with a table- 
spoonful of butter or drippings, — beef drippings or poultry 
drippings, — and fry it light brown; then put on the peas and cold 
water and proceed just as we do to-day for a plain pea soup, 
without any addition except a seasoning of salt and pepper, and 
by and by a little flour and butter, which I shall put in at the 
close, the object of which Iwill explain to you then. 

BEEF AND VEGETABLE SOUP. 

For four quarts of soup use one cu^jful each of the ingredients 
which I shall name: lean beef cut in half-inch pieces; carrot, 
which must first be scraped and then cut in half-inch bits; tur- 
nip, which must be peeled and then cut in small pieces; rice^ 
picked over, washed in cold water; tomatoes, peeled and sliced 
if they are fresh; but if you use canned tomatoes simply 
cut them in small pieces; half a cupful of onion, peeled and 
chopped rather fine; and four quarts of cold water. First put 
the water over the fire with the beef in it, and let it gradually 
heat; while it is heating get ready all the other ingredients that 
I have spoken of, and add them when the water is hot. Don't 



UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA. 19 

add salt for seasoning until after the soup has been cooking for 
a little while, because it would tend to harden the meat. When 
the soup is boiling, put in all the other ingredients; and after 
the soup has cooked for an hour, season it with salt and pepper. 
Cook it slowly for about two hours, or until the vegetables are 
tender. The length of time will depend somewhat on the season 
of the year. You will find that carrots and turnips, like all 
vegetables wfiich have woody fibre in them, will cook more 
quickly early in the winter while they stiil have their natural 
moisture in them. The later in the winter it grows the drier 
they get, the harder the woody fibre is, and the longer it will 
take to cook them tender. So you will cook the soup until the 
vegetables are tender; and then, having seen that it is palatably 
seasoned, serve it with all the vegetables in it. You notice that 
this is a thick soup, made in an entirely different way from that 
which I made this morning. I think some of the ladies are here 
who were here this morning. Then we were making clear soup 
which is to be served without any vegetables in it. This is a 
good hearty soup for every-day use; in fact it is so hearty that 
you can make the bulk of a meal using this and bread or pota- 
toes. When all the vegetables are quite tender then the soup 
simply is to be served. 

Now, while I am preparing the soup, I want to say a little 
about the value of soup as a food. This comes properly into our 
afternoon course of instruction. Many of the ladies may not 
have thought of it in precisely the connection in which I am go- 
ing to speak of it. Habitually, Americans do not use soup. 
Some have grown gradually accustomed to have soup as a part 
of their every- day dinner, but as a rule people have it once or 
twice a week. I am speaking now of average families. As a 
matter of fact, it ought to be used every day, because it is not 
only a very easy form in which to obtain nourishment, but you 
obtain from soup that which you would not get fi'om any other 
dish; that is, you get every particle of the nourishment there is 
in the ingredients which you put into the soap. You can make a 
perfectly nutritious and palatable meal with soup at about one- 
half the cost of a meal without soup, because the soup, if it is 
savory, will be eaten with a relish; and it will satisfy the appe- 
tite for two reasons; the first I have already spoken of — because 
you get every particle of nourishment there is in the ingredients; 
and second, because directly you eat it — that is, directly it 
reaches the stomach, some of its nutritious liquid i^roperties 



20 BIENNIAL REPORT 

will begin to be absorbed at once. They pass directly into the 
system, by the process which is known in physiology as osmosis 
— that is, absorption by the coats of the stomach; so that the 
liquid part of the food is actually absorbed and passes into the 
circulation in less than five minutes after you have eaten it. A 
very familiar illustration of that fact was made by Sir Henry 
Thompson several years ago, in his exceedi ngly val^iable article 
called ''Food and Feeding," where he said that a hungry man 
eating clear soup for his dinner would feel a sense of refreshment 
in less than three minutes; that is, he would feel the effect of 
his plate of clear soup almost as soon as he would feel the stimu- 
lus which he would receive from a glass of wine. He would feel 
refreshed at once; his sense of hunger, which is the indication 
that his system needs food, would be practically appeased within 
three minutes from the time he had taken his soup. 

Then there is another very important question; and that is 
the effect of soups and liquid foods on the appetite for stimu- 
lants. I am not a temperance advocate in the sense in which 
the word is usually understood. That is, I neither believe in 
nor advocate total abstinence; but I do believe in temperance — 
in the temperate use of everything; no matter whether it is 
drink, or food, or pleasure, in a life of work, so that I speak 
solely from the standpoint of an advocate of the moderate use of 
everything. The system requires a certain amount of liquid 
nourishment. We have to get that in the form of liquid, and 
many people take it by using water to excess — drinking quanti- 
ties of water. On the other hand, there are some people who 
never drink more than a glass of water all day long. They must 
drink something — some kind of liquid — to makeup the quantity 
of water that is absolutely required by the system in the course 
of twenty-four hours. Some persons take it in the form of tea 
and coffee; others drink beer and wine; but a certain amount of 
liquid the system must have, l^ow, you can easily see that you 
can supply a part of that liquid in the form of soups and stews. 
It is not possible for many people to drink much cold water: it 
does not seem to agree with them. The advocates of the latest 
craze, for hot water, will get their quantity of liquid, but they 
will get it in a, form that by and by will make serious trouble for 
them; because, while under certain conditions the entire mucous 
membrane or lining' of the digestive tract, warm water may be 
desirable, still the excessive use of it is very apt in time to pro- 
duces a serious congestion. Now, the fact once admitted that 



UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA. 21 

we must have a certain amouDt of liquid supplied to tlie system 
every day, then the question comes of giving it in a form that will 
he the least injurious to the system. I think I have shown you one 
or two good reasons why soup supplies it well. On the score of 
economy there is no food which can be as cheaply prepared as 
soup — that is, no palatable, enjoyable, nutritious food. It is 
possible to make this soup, this thick soup which I am making 
now, in ^ew York, and here also, I suppose, for less than ten 
cents a gallon, buying the materials at retail ; and I am sure a 
gallon of this soup will go very far towards satisfying one^s 
hunger. I presume, from what I have seen of the market reports 
in the papers, that it can be made here quite as cheaply as it 
can in New York. 

Question. Does that make very strong soup — does it give a 
very good rich flavor of the meat, with one cupful of meat to a 
gallon of water ? 

Miss Corson. That gives a perfectly nutritious soup. It 
gives as much nutriment from the meat as is needed by the sys- 
tem. 

Question. Wouldn't a bone or two thrown in be a good thing? 

Miss Corson. You can put in bones if you want to. But I 
am giving you a recipe for a perfectly nutritious soup, made 
upon the most economical principles. The proportion of meat 
which I use here is all that is required by the system in connec- 
tion with the other ingredients. We Americans have, as a rule, 
the idea that there is no nutritious food except meat. We think 
that we get all our nourishment from meat; and the other things 
— the vegetables and bread, and all those other articles of food 
that we eat, are what the dressmakers would call '' trimmings. '^ 
We do not regard them as real nourishing food, when in reality 
there are some vegetables which are nearly as nutritious as meat. 
Take for instance, lentils; I do not know if you are familiar with 
them. They are a variety of vetch or field pea, little flat, dried 
peas, that grow very abundantly; in fact, if they are once plant- 
ed in a field it is almost impossible to .root them out. They have 
been for ages used in all older countries, in Egypt, in Asia, all 
through Europe, especially in Germany. Within the last ten 
years they have become known in this country. Lentils, with 
the addition of a very little fat in the form of fat meat, suet, 
drippings or butter, are quite as nutritious as meat; that is, they 
sustain strength, and enable people to work just as well as meat. 
So, you see, that so far as actual nourishment is concerned, veg- 



22 BIENNIAL REPORT 

etables approach closely to meat. Kext to lentils come peas 
and beans, dried peas and beans. I have not graded the dif- 
ferent articles of food, but some day when we have more time I 
will give you a table of nutritive values of different articles of 
food so that you can form some comparison in your own mind. 
Kemember this, that meat is not the only nutritious article of 
food in use, and we only need a certain quantity of it. For in- 
stance, for the purpose of health meat once a day will answer. 
It is very nice to have it two or even three times if we want it, or 
if we can afford it; but if we have it once a day we answer all the 
requirements of health, and in communities where it is not pos- 
sible to have an abundant supply of fresh meat, a very small 
proportion of salt meat used in connection with the most nutri- 
tious vegetables keeps the health and strength of the really ac- 
tive laborers up to the working point. 

MEAT STEWS. 

For a brown stew, use any kind of dark meat. To day I am 
going to use some of the cooked round of beef; but you can use 
fresh beef; you can use raw beef, rare roast beef, or any of the 
dark meats; always use white meats for white stews. Presently 
we will make a white stew of veal; but for a brown stew use 
dark meats. Cut the meat in pieces about an inch and a half 
square, put it over the fire with enough fat of some kind to keep 
it from burning; use the fat of the meat, or drippings, or butter, 
and brown it as fast as possible. If you make a stew large 
enough for four or five people, use about three pounds of beef. 
As soon as the meat is brown, sprinkle a heaping tablespoon fn I of 
flour over it; then add enough boiling water to cover the meat, 
and three teaspoons of vinegar. The vinegar is used for the 
purpose of softening the fibres of the meat and making it ten- 
der. You will find that by adding vinegar to meat in cooking, 
you can always make it tender. When we come to treat of 
steak, I shall explain that. After the vinegar has been used, 
season the meat palatably with salt and pepper, cover it, and 
let it cook very gently for at least an hour, or until it is tender. 
To the stew add any vegetable you wish, or cook it perfectly 
plain, having only the meat and the gravy. To-day I am going 
to use carrots with it. For three pounds of be^f use carrots 
enough to fill a pint bowl after they are cut in little slices, or in 
little quarters. Of course, if you add vegetables of any kind. 



UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA. 23 

carrots, turnips, or potatoes, you want to put them in long 
enough before the meat is done to insure their being perfectly- 
cooked. For instance, carrots take from one to two hours to 
cook; I shall put the carrots in directly I make the gravy. Tur- 
nips, if they are fresh, will cook in about half an hour. Pota- 
toes will cook in twenty minutes; small onions will cook in from 
half to three-quarters of an hour. The meat usually needs to 
cook about two hours. The meat being brown, I shall put in a 
tablespoonful of flour, stirring it, and then send it down to you so 
that you can see what it is like. The question naturally would 
arise about the color of this stew, throwing in raw flour, the 
white, uncooked flour. You can see for yourselves what the ef- 
fect is. 

Question. Does cold meat cook as long as raw ? 

Miss Corson. If you use cold meat brown it just in the same 
way, just exactly as we browned this, first in drippings or but- 
ter and then putting in the flour; only if you use meat which al- 
ready has been cooked, it will not take it so long to cook as it 
does this raw meat. 

For a white stew, use any kind of white meat — veal, pork, 
poultry, or lamb. To-day I shall use veal. To go back to the 
question which was debated this morning about washing meat: 
first, wipe the meat all over with a wet towel. It is important 
to have the towel clean. Wet the towel in cold water and wipe 
the meat, then cut it in little pieces about two inches square. 
The butcher will crack all the bones, and if you wish he 
will cut the meat for you. At least he will crack the bones so 
that the meat can be easily cut in pieces about two inches 
square. Put it over the fire; suppose you have three pounds of 
meat; put it in cold water enough to cover it. Let it slowly 
boil; when it boils, add about a tablespoonful of salt and a dozen 
grains of peppercorns, or a small red pepper, or if you have not 
either of those seasonings, about half a saltspoonful of ordinary 
pepper; and let the meat boil slowly until it is tender. That 
will be in from an hour to two hours, according to the tender- 
ness of the meat in the beginning. When the meat is tender lay 
a. clean towel in a colander, set over a bowl or an earthen jar, 
and pour the meat and broth directly into the colander. Let 
the broth run through the towel. If the meat has any particles 
of scum on it, wipe the pieces with a wet towel to remove the 
scum. You can, in making the stew, remove the scum as you 
would from clear soup, but in that case you have not quite so 



24 BIENNIAT. REPORT 

richly flavored a stew. The better way is to wipe off the little 
particles after you have taken up the meat. Now you have the 
meat cooked quite tender and the broth strained. Then you 
make the sauce. Any of the ladies who were at the lesson this 
morning and saw the white sauce made, will understand the 
principle upon which the sauce is made for the stew. Put a 
heaping tablespoonful of butter and a heaping tablespoonful of 
flour into a saucepan for the quantity of broth which you would 
be likely to have from about three pounds of meat; that would 
be broth enough to cover it. Stir the butter and flour until they 
are smoothly mixed; then begin to add the meat broth gradually 
until you have used enough of the broth to make the sauce like 
thick cream. If you find that you have not enough broth from 
the meat, add a little hot water, to make the sauce or gravy like 
thick cream; then put the meat into it. Season it palatably with 
salt and pepper, remembeiing that you already have some sea- 
soning in it. Stir the meat in the saucepan over the fire until it 
is hot, and then serve it. That gives you a plain white stew of 
meat. You can transform that into a dish called in French 
cookery books blanquette, or white stew of meat, by adding to it 
just before you take it off the fire a tablespoonful of chopped par- 
sley and the yolk of one egg. You will add the egg by separ- 
ating the yolk from the white, putting the yolk in a cup with 
two or three tablespoonfuls of gravy from the meat and mix it 
well; then turn it all among the meat, stir it and dish it at once. 
Don't let the stew go back on the fire after you put in the yolk 
of egg', it may curdle the egg if the sauce or the stew boils 
after the egg is added. So you see you have a plain white stew, 
or a stew with the addition of chopped parsley, or chopped par- 
sley and the yolk of an egg. Do not use the white of the egg. 

Question. Why is not the fat meat as good as the lean ? 

Miss Corson. Do you mean why is it not as nutritious? 
Lean meat nourishes muscle and flesh. Fat meat affords heat to 
the system. That is the reason why we naturally crave more 
fat meat in cold weather. It is not so strengthening; it is heat- 
ing and in that nutritious. A great deal of its substance, of 
course, is wasted in the cooking. That is another reason why^ 
weight for weight, fat meat is not so nutritious as lean. 

Question. In making this stew brown or white {do you use 
bones? 

Miss Corson. You can use bones. In making the soup to- 
day I used cooked lean meat that was on hand over from the soup 



UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA. 25- 

this morning. You can use the breast of any kind of brown 
meat; you can use the ends of the ribs of roast beef; you remem- 
ber the rather fat ends of the ribs of roast beef? After cooking 
the beef have these cut up in small pieces; after you have cooked 
them in the stew if there is any excess of fat, as there probably 
will be, skim that off and put it by to add to any brown stew or 
gravy; the fat replaces drippings in that case. That is a very 
good way to use ends of ribs of beef. Cold beefsteak makes a 
nice brown stew, treated in this same way. 

Question. Do you skim the stew % 

Miss Corson. Xo. Not unless you are going to make a per- 
fectly clear soup need you ever skim; because, as I explained 
this morning, the scum which rises on the surface in boiling^ 
meat is not dirt, it is albumen and blood, with the same nutri- 
tious properties as the meat itself, and you do not want to re- 
move them. If the water boils away in cooking soups and stews 
always add a little more; it will save time if you add boiling 
water, unless as in the case of peas, you add cold water for the 
purpose of softening them. You will find, if you are trying to 
cook dried beans, that it will be'well to add cold water, and boil 
them gradually. 

Question. In cooking beans isn't it a good way to let the beans 
come to a boil and then pour off the water and put on more 
cold? 

Miss Corson. That is simply a question of taste. It is not 
necessary to do it. If you pour away the first water in which 
they come to a boil, you pour away a certain amount of their 
nourishment, which already has escaped in the water. Some 
people say that they like to pour away that first water, because 
it carries off the strong taste of the beans. That is a question 
for any one to settle individually. The water would not have 
the strong taste of the beans if there were not some of the nour- 
ishment of the beans in it. While we are on the subject of 
beans I might tell you a good way to cook beans plainly, a favor- 
ite way in the south of France, the beans to be served with 
roast mutton. Cook them in just water enough to cover them, 
after having first washed them, adding only water enough to 
keep them covered all the time. They are dried white beans. 
Then at the last, when the beans are tender, leave off the cover 
of the sauce pan and let the beans cook, so that nearly all the 
water is evaporated, and the beans have about them simply 
water enough to form a very thick sauce, just enough to moisten 
4 



^6 BIENNIAL REPORT. 

them. Then they are seasoned with salt and pepper. In that 
way they are served as stewed beans, with roast mutton or roast 
lamb. 

In regard to the lentils that I was talking to you about, I 
think you may be able to learn something more about them from 
Prof. Porter. He probably would know. You long ago have 
made their acquaintance in the form of the tares that the enemy 
sowed among the wheat. Lentils are really a species of tare or 
vetch. If you do not know about them — if they are not known 
in the market — it really would be worth while to make some 
inquiry which would lead to the introduction of them; but very 
likely if there are German people here, as I suppose there are, — 
there are always German people in every thriving city, — they 
will already have had them for sale in their special groceries: 
you can get them in that way, and they make a very good win- 
ter vegetable to use alternately with others. You cook them 
either by soaking them over night, or boil them just as we boiled 
the peas, until they are tender, and then drain them, and either 
heat them, with a little salt and pepper and butter, after they 
are drained, or fry them. They are exceedingly nice fried with 
a little chopped onion or parsley. If you have a pint bowl full 
of lentils, use a tablespoonful of chopped parsley, a tablespoon- 
ful of onion, very finely chopped; put the onion in the frying 
pan with a tablespoonful of butter or drippings, and let it 
brown; then put in the lentils and chopped parsley, a little salt 
and pepper, stir them till you have them hot, and serve them. 
They are exceedingly good. 

Prof. Porter. I may say that the first cousin of the 
lentils is well known among our Minnesota farmers in our wheat 
fields, and they are such an intolerable pest that we prefer 
paying the duties on the German article and importing them. 

PEA SOUP — Continued. 
(The pea soup being now about ready to take up, Miss Corson continued:) 

You know how the flour of the peas settles to the bottom of 
the soup tureen or plate, and leaves the top clear'? Prevent that 
by adding to the soup, just before it is dished, a little paste made 
of flour and butter. For four quarts of soup a tablespoonful of 
flour and a tablesijoonful of butter ; mix the flour and butter to 
a smooth paste just before the soup is done. After the peas are 
soft i)Our them into a fine sieve and rub them through the sieve 



UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA. 27 

with a potato masher; just a stout wire sieve. After you have 
rubbed them through the sieve put them back into the soup 
kettle with the soup, and mix the flour and butter in with them 
over the fire ; stir them until they come to a boil, then season 
palatably with salt and pepper, and the soup is ready to serve. 
Eemember this is a perfectly plain soup I am making to-day, 
without the addition of meat of any kind; but of course you will 
vary the flavor of the soup by adding the bones of ham or other 
meat, or a very little fried onion. Now, you can count for your- 
selves how cheap a soup that is. 

Question. Can you give us your experience with regard to 
pea meal for soup ? 

Miss Corson. I have used one form that has been put on the 
New York market. It was made of dried green peas. I do not 
know whether there is on this market a meal made of the yellow 
peas. There is a German preparation which is admirable. In 
New York it is for sale at the German stores ; but the meal of 
which I speak, the meal made of dried green peas, was not at 
all satisfactory to me. Of course the meal of the green peas has 
not the flavor of the split peas. You will find in rubbing the 
peas through the sieve that if you moisten them a little once in 
a while they will go through more readily. 

I have left the brown stew with all the fat on. It is a question 
not only of taste but of economy whether you leave on the fat 
in addition to the first butter in which you browned the meat, a 
question of economy and nourishment. If the people you are 
cooking for have good strong digestions you do not need to 
remove the fat. The bread or potatoes which are eaten with 
the stew will absorb it and will render it perfectly digestible ; 
and, of course, as I have already told you, the fat serves certain 
purposes in nutrition. If you are cooking for people having 
weak digestions then you would take the fat ofi" the stew. The 
white stew I am going to finish plain, without any parsley or 
egg — simply seasoned with salt and pepper.

LECTUEE THIRD. 



Our lesson this morning is the clarifying of soup, or the soup 
stock that we made yesterday; caramel for coloring soup, gravy 
and sauces; baked whitefish, after a very nice Western fashion f 
beefsteak, broiled and fried; and baked apple dumplings. 

The first thing I prepare will be the whitefish, after a method 
which I learned from one of my Cleveland friends, who, by the 
way, is one of the nicest cooks I know of. I shall use only a little 
butter, and tell you about the wine which the recipe calls for. 
When the fish is prepared especially for gentlemen, wine is con- 
sidered exceedingly nice, but that, as in all other cookery, is a 
matter of choice. We to day will use some butter, pepper and 
salt. I will tell you the kind of wine, and the quantity that is 
used, when I come to cook the fish. In the winter, of course, all 
the fish is frozen. We were speaking of that yesterday, how to 
prepare frozen fish. In the first place, thaw it in plenty of cold 
water. Put it in a large pan of cold water and let it stay till it is 
perfectly thawed. Then cut it from the bone and take off the 
skin. Kow, please write down the directions, and then watch 
and see how I do it. The fish simply has been scaled; to cut it 
from the bone, make one cut down to the bone through the mid- 
dle of the side of the fish, lengthwise; having made that line, cut 
round under the head, to the bone; now lay the knife against the 
bone of the fish, and turn it until you have the blade cutting 
against the bone, holding the knife flat; it will take that entire 
piece of the fish off; 'cut two pieces from one side of the 
fish. Now I am going to cut from the other side in the same 
way, and then I shall take the skin off. First take the four 
pieces of fish off the bone; you will not find this at all difficult 
to do, ladies; after you have done it once or twice it will be very 
easy, and if you have fish that has not been frozen it will be 
much more easy to do than if you have frozen fish, which, of 
course, will break a little. It is not possible to keep the pieces 
entire, cutting from a frozen fish. One of the ladies asks if this 
can be done as well if the fish has been dressed by the fish- 
monger; that is, if the entrails have been taken out. Yes, quite 
as well. This is not dressed simply because it had been sent from 
market without being dressed. I did not take the trouble to 
have it dressed here, as I am not going to use the bone of 



UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA. ^ 

the fish. After I have finished giving you the direction for tak- 
ing off the skin, I am going to tell you how you could use the 
bone of the fish. To cut the skin off the fish, lay the pieces of 
fish skin down on the board; then, holding the knife down 
straight, cut through the fish until you feel the skin under the 
knife; as soon as you feel the skin under the knife, flatten the 
knife out so that it lies against the skin; cut away from you, 
holding the knife perfectly level, leaving the skin between the 
board and the knife. Hold the piece of fish in your fingers; 
lay it flat on the board, skin down, keeping hold of the skin all 
the time." That takes the skin off, and none of the fish; there is 
no waste there, and it certainly is very much easier to eat fish 
in this shape than it is if you have the skin and bone on it. 
Now, I assure you, ladies, if you only hold the knife flat, you 
will have no trouble whatever in taking the skin off". If you 
slant it you will cut through the skin of the fish, but if you hold 
it perfectly flat you will have no trouble. Of course, with cer- 
tain kinds of fish there are bones that run transversely from the 
spine out through the sides of the fish. You do not take these 
bones out by this operation, but you take out the large back 
bone. It comes out every time, and I assure you it is a very easy 
operation. 

After you have taken all the skin and bones from the fish, 
then, for this special dish, cut it'^in small slices three inches long 
and a couple of inches wide. Use two soup plates, or two dish- 
es of the same size, deep dishes that you can send to the table. 
Butter them very thickly, both of them. Lay the fish in one of 
the dishes, season the layers with salt and pepper, and put a 
very little butter between each layer, and plenty of butter on 
the top. Turn the second plate over the first one, upside down 
on it. Put the dishes with the fish between them into the oven 
to bake for about twenty minutes, or until the fish flakes. You 
can tell about that by opening the oven at the end of twenty 
minutes, and lifting off the top plate; then you can see whether 
the fish is done or not. Now, in the recipe of which I spoke to 
you first, the addition of Sauterne wine is made. After the fish 
is put into the dish, being seasoned as I have told you, using 
less butter than you would without the wine, with half as much 
butter on the layers, pour on Sauterne wine, — that is a light, 
rather acid wine, — just enough to moisten the fish. In placing 
the fish into the dish it does not make any difference which side 
you put down. You simply want to put the pieces [nicely to- 



30 BIENNIAL REPORT 

gether so that when you come to help them you can lift each 
piece out with a spoon. There is no acid that will take the 
place of the wine and give the same taste. The fish is very nice 
cooked simply with the butter, pepper and salt. You do not 
need the wine to make a nice dish, only wine is used by the lady 
of whom I speak. That is her special preparation of the dish. 
The wine is put in after the fish is in the dish, just enough wine 
to moisten it. You will notice that often I will make dishes that 
have no wine in them; if I make dishes that require wine, I of 
course put it in, saying that you may use the wine or not, as you 
please. In this instance I use butter, pepper and salt -because 
it makes a very nice dish, a very nice plain dish, but it is a dis- 
tinct dish, entirely different to the dish cooked with wine; 
simply two ways of cooking fish, making two different dishes. 
For a fish of this size — which probably weighed nearly three 
pounds — you may use about a heaping tablespoonful of butter 
in all; that is, besides what you put on the plates. You will 
butter the plates, and distribute butter throughout the dish. 
The oven should be moderately hot, not hot enough to brown it 
— hot enough to heat the plates, which are very thick, and to 
cook the fish within twenty or twenty-five minutes. 

If you wash the board on which the fish is cut, at once, in plen- 
ty of hot water, with soap and a little soda or borax all the odor 
of the fish will be removed. Don't let any of the utensils stand 
with the fish drying on them, because if you do it will be very 
much harder to destroy the odor. And, by the way, ladies, the 
odor of onions is another thing that troubles some persons. The 
odor of onions on boards, knives and dishes you can do away 
with entirely by using parsley. If you take a knife with which 
you have cut onions, and chop a little parsley with it, or draw 
the knife through the root of parsley two or three times, it en- 
tirely destroys thQ odor of the onion. So that you see you never 
need have any trouble in that way in the kitchen. 

One of the ladies asks me how to prevent the odor of onions 
going through the house when you are cooking them. What 
makes onions, cabbage and turnips smell when you are cooking 
them is the escape of an exceedingly volatile oil which they all 
contain; in all of them it has the same characteristics; it does 
not begin to escape until they are tender. The oil does not begin 
to escape until the vegetables are tender; if you continue to boil 
them after that, it will escape. If you take up cabbage or tur- 
nips as soon as they are tender, that is, as soon as their sub- 



UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA. 31 

stance begins to grow tender, you will notice there will be com- 
paratively little odor; but if you keep on boiling them, accord- 
ing to the old-fashioned rules, for an hour, two hours, or three 
hours, — you know you sometimes boil cabbage all day long, — 
you will be sure to have a nice odor through the house. In cut- 
ting the onions, of course, if you bend over them, that same oil 
rising from them escapes as you cut into their substance, and 
will be sure to make you cry; but if you hold them a little away 
from you in peeling them, or under water, or if you stand where 
there is a draught blowing over your hands, it will blow that 
oil away. In eating onions at the table, if you will subsequently 
eat parsley dipped in vinegar, you will find that there will be 
very little odor of the onion remaining in the breath. 

Now to return to our fish. After you have taken the flesh of 
the fish off the bone, you still would see a little of the fish re- 
maining, even if you cut closely. Then draw the fish, and trim 
the bone; that is, cut ofT the head, and the fins, and the tail, 
and take out the entrails of the fish; then make a paste of dry 
mustard, salt, and a dust of Cayenne pepper. For a bone the 
size we have here, a long bone like that, use two heaping table- 
spoonfuls of mustard, a dust of Cayenne pepper and enough vin- 
egar, or Worcestershire sauce, to moisten the mustard to make 
a paste, which is to be spread over the fishbone. Have the 
double wire gridiron very thickly buttered, put the bone into 
the gridiron, brown it quickly at a hot fire, and serve it simply 
as a relish. A sort of Barmecide ftast, but I assure you it is 
very nice with bread or crackers and butter. It makes a very 
nice little relish. I might say, ladies, that you can treat any 
kind of bones in this way. Cold roast beef bones are exceed- 
ingly nice. Of course there will be more flesh on the beef bones 
than on the fish bones. 

PLAIN PASTRY. 

Use butter, or lard, or very finely chopped suet. If you can 
get good lard it makes nice pastry; by that I mean lard which 
has a very little water in it. A good deal of the lard that you 
buy in the stores has a large proportion of water in it, and I 
believe in these days it is apt to be sophisticated with several 
articles which are not exactly lard, so that home-made lard is de- 
cidedly the best; that which you try out yourself. First take 
the butter, or whatever shortening you use, — butter, lard, or 



32 BIENNIAL REPORT 

suet, — and mix it with twice the quantity of flour. For instance, 
if you are going to use a pound of flour allow half a pound of 
shortening. Take half the shortening and mix it with the flour, 
using a knife. Then wet the mixed flour and butter with just 
enough cold water to form a paste which you can roll out. If 
you mix with a knife or spoon you avoid heating the pastry. 
After the flour and the first half of the shortening have been mixed 
to a paste roll it out, about half an inch thick, and put the rest 
of the shortening in flakes on it. One of the ladies asks about 
putting flour on the pastry board: Extra flour, of course, be- 
sides the quantity that you put in the pastry. The only object in 
washing the butter is to get out any buttermilk that there may be 
in it. After putting^ the butter — the second half of the butter — 
over the pastry in rather large pieces, put just a little flour over it, 
fold the pastry in'such a way that the edge is turned up all round 
to inclose the butter; that is about an inch and a half all round. 
Fold the pastry together thin, and roll it out, and fold it several 
times. Remember that the oftener you fold it and roll it the 
more flakes you will have in the cooked pastry. Take care to 
use flour enough to keep it from sticking to the board or the 
roller. You will remember the pastry is not salted and unless 
the shortening has enough salt in it to salt the flour, you must 
add it. Good lard makes a more tender pastry than butter. 

Question. Do you ever mix them ? 

Miss Corson. Yes, you can mix them if you like, using part 
lard and part butter. To roll out the pastry, roll it in a rather 
long strip, that is, a strip about three times as long as it is wide. 
That enables you then to fold it and keep it in a nice shape. It 
does not make any difference whether you roll it from you or 
towards you. As many times as you roll and fold it you give it 
three additional layers. [N'ow I might keep on rolling and fold- 
ing indefinitely, and I simply should make the pastry have more 
layers than this has, but I think you thoroughly understand 
that, so that I will roll it out, and make our dumplings now. 
Only remember that the more times you roll it the more folds 
you make, the more layers you have in the pastry. Keep it as 
cool as possible all the time. If you roll and fold it three times 
remember that you have nine layers of butter and pastry. You 
can roll it out more than that if you want to. Puff paste, which 
is rolled and folded in this way, has what is called nine turns. 
Rolling and folding it three times makes a turn. The object of 
using marble or stone pastry slabs is to keep the pastry cool. 



UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA. 33 

If you make more pastry than you want to use, ^vscap it in a 
floured towel and put it in a very cool place ; then when you 
are ready to use it roll and fold it two or three times, and it will 
be very much better than when first made. I am going to roll 
up a strip of the pastry that I cut off the edge in such a way 
that you will see how the layers are formed, and you can pass it 
about. One of the ladies has asked me about heating the flour. 
It is not necessary to heat the flour for pastry, on the contrary, 
it would rather tend to spoil it. You want to keep it as cool as 
possible. But in the winter when you are going to m^-ke bread, 
if you heat the flour it facilitates the rising of the bread; there 
you need the heat. 

BAKED APPLE DUMPLINGS. 

For apple dumplings, after the pastry is made, cut it in pieces 
^bout four inches square and about a quarter of an inch thick. 
One of the ladies asks about sifting the flour. That is neces- 
sary, always. For. apple dumplings, peel the apples and take 
out the cores, leaving the apples as whole as possible. The corer 
that I have here is nothing but a round tin cylinder. Use any 
apple corer that will take the core out without breaking the 
apple. For this purpose Greening apples are the nicest. These 
are table apples. Put an apple on each piece of pastry. In the 
core of the apple put as much sugar as it will hold, and a very 
small pinch of powdered cinnamon — about a quarter of a salt- 
spoonful of powdered cinnamon, or any powdered spice you 
prefer. Then fold the corners of the square pieces of pastry up 
over the apple so that they will lap over on the top of the apple. 
Fasten the corners by moistening them a little with cold water. 
After the dumplings are all made, brush them over the top with, 
water, or with melted butter, or with egg, beaten; the entire 
eggj or if you have the white or the yolk, you can beat that up; 
of course if you use just the yolk yon make them a little yel- 
lower. If you use the yolk of an egg, beat it with a little water. 
Ladies are asking me about that little rolling pin. It is like that 
little knife, it is bewitched, but the magic consists simply in 
keeping the rolling pin perfectly smooth, and the knife sharp. 
That is made of hard wood, and is polished so that it is perfectly 
smooth, and of course I keep it so by not having it soaked in 
water. Instead of putting water and soap on to clean it, it sim- 
ply will be wiped with a wet cloth, and then with a dry one. 
The thousand dents it has in it it has got by travel; it has been 
5 



34 BIENNIAL REPORT 

knocked around in my traveling trunk for the last five years. 
The dents did not get in it by using it.. It may be made of any 
hard wood. One of the ladies asks me why I leave the corners 
of the dumpling open. I could pat the crust around and bring 
it right up close to the apple, but it would not be so light in the 
first place. . The crust will hold together, it will not break apart 
in baking, and you leave the ends nice and light; and it makes 
a nicer-looking dumpling. The idea seems to be that if I should 
close up the corners the juice of the apples would stay in. It 
won't boil* out much, anyway. 

DSTow, ladies, I am going to take a little of the soup stock that 
we made yesterday out in a cup and pass it, so you can see what 
it looks like before it is clarified. That is the soup stock or 
broth that we made yesterday. You will remember where your 
recipe ended yesterday, about the soup stock being poured into 
a bowl and allowed to cool. That is the condition in which the 
stock is now. After a little, I am going to tell you about the 
clarifying of it, but now I want to finish telling you about dump- 
lings, so you will have all your dumpling recipes in one place. 

The question was asked, I believe, about the temperature of 
the oven. About the same as for the fish — a moderate oven, so 
you can put your hand in and count, say fifteen, quickly. It 
takes from half an hour to three-quarters to bake the dumplings. 
Be careful not to brown them. If the pastry seems to be brown- 
ing before the apples get done, — and something will depend upon 
the kind of apples you use, — cover the pastry with a buttered 
paper. The object of the egg on the dumplings is to make them 
a little glossy. Use either butter, or egg, or water for brushing 
over the tops. 

STEAMED APPLE DUMPLINGS. 

For steamed dumplings usually a suet crust is used. You 
could use this crust if you wanted to, but it would not be sure 
to be light. It might possibly absorb a little of the steam. For 
suet crust you would use half a pound of suet chopped very fine, 
a teaspoonful of salt and a pound of flour. Mix carefully the 
flour and suet and salt with enough cold water to make a pastry 
just soft enough to roll out. Roll it out about a quarter of an 
inch thick, and then cut it in little squares; prepare the apples 
just as I prepare them for the baked dumpling; instead of fold- 
ing the crust up and leaving the corners open, pat it with your 
hands so that you entirely inclose the apple. Just roll the 



UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA. 35 

pastry out once and then inclose the apples in it, and put the 
dumpling into the steamer; that is, an ordinary tin steamer; set 
over a pot of boiling water and steam the dumplings until they 
are done. You must decide that by running a trussing needle 
or knitting needle through the pastry into the apple. It may 
take an hour and a half to steam the dumplings; be sure they 
are done. 

For another kind of pastry that has been described to me by 
enthusiastic gentlemen who used to have mothers, a kind of 
pastry ^Hhat melted in your mouth;" it is very easy to make 
that; not a flaky pastry, but a soft, exceedingly tender pastry 
that really crumbles. To do that you simply rub all of the 
shortening into the flour. Half a pound of shortening and a 
pound of flour; put the shortening into the flour with the salt; 
rub them with your hands till you have the shortening thor- 
oughly mixed with the flour. It looks like meal; the ingredi- 
ents must be thoroughly mixed, but not melted together; then 
use just enough cold water to make the pastry, and roll it out 
just once, and use it; be sure to keep it cool. 

Question. Did you say an hour and a half for steamed dump- 
ling? 

Miss Oorson. It will take nearly that, but you must try 
them; try them at the end of an hour. For the dumpling you 
can use one of the sauces I told you of yesterday morning, white 
cream sauce, or. you can use simply powdered sugar, or pow- 
dered sugar mixed with a little cinnamon. You can use a hard 
sauce, which is butter and sugar mixed together in equal quan- 
tities, with any flavoring you like. 

FRIED BEEFSTEAK. 

That is supposed to be the great abomination of American 
cooking, so that we are going now to see whether it can not be 
nearly as nicely fried as broiled- It seems a heresy, but it is 
true, and there are very many occasions where it is not possible 
to broil in an ordinary kitchen; the fire may not be good, or 
uncovering it may cojol the oven. There is a very important 
secret in frying beefsteak, or chops, and that is to have the pan 
hot before you put the meat into it. It doesn't make any dif- 
ference what kind of a pan you use. Use the ordinary iron fry- 
ing pan, the old-fashioned spider, or dripping pan, if you wish 
to; but have the pan hot; ^have the pan hot enough to sear the 



36 BIENNIAL REPORT. 

outside of the meat directly it touches it; after the pan is hot 
put the beefsteak, or chops — because they are both cooked in 
the same way — into the hot pan. If the meat is entirely lean, 
if there is not a particle of fat on it, you may put not more than 
half a teaspoonful of butter in the pan; run it quickly over the 
bottom of the pan. But I never saw meat yet so lean, unless the 
fat was all trimmed off, that there was not fat enough to cook 
any chop or steak. The portion of fat you will usually find on 
meat is about one-third, unless you take the meat from the short 
loin; that is called the porterhouse, or tenderloin steak. In that 
case you have an excess of fat; there is more than one- third, 
reckoning in the kidney fat, or suet. You may cut away some 
of the fat, unless the butchers have cut it away. The butcher 
has already cut it away from this piece, and, by the way, I no- 
tice that Minneapolis butchers cut a very long and thin steak. 
Now I would not advise the cooking, broiling or frying of that 
thin end. I would rather buy two steaks of that kind and cut 
off that and use it for stewing, because it would stew very 
nicely; broiled it will be rather tough. 

As my frying pan is small I am going to cut the steak short. 
These steaks are cut too thin. A beefsteak to be nice should be over 
an inch thick — an inch and a half thick. You can easily econo- 
mise on a thick steak by simply cutting it in halves, and 
using only as much of it as you want at once, because in almost 
any weather steak will keep at least over night. Have it too thick 
rather than too thin. Have it just the thickness you want and 
then cut it in two, using part only if you only need part of it. 
Trim off the outside skin, the tough skin; scrape the steak to 
make sure that there are no particles of bone on it. That bone, 
of course, comes in sawing the steak. Out off the cartilage at 
the top of the steak, otherwise the steak may curl up. Have 
your pan hot enough to make it sear. Put the steak in and 
brown it quickly, first on one side and then on the other. In 
turning the steak run a knife or fork under it and lift it. Don't 
stick a fork into it, because by doing that you make little holes 
in the fibre of the steak and so let the juice escape. 
Question. Will you pound your steak ? . 
Miss Carson. IS^o, decidedly not; that lets out the juice. You 
make little holes in the steak if you stick a fork into it, and by 
pounding you let the juice out. Now, you want to keep all 
the juice in the steak, all the juice that you can; so that, in turn- 
ing the steak simply lift it with a fork or knife and turn it over^ 



UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA. 37 

when it is brown on both sides push the frying pan back toward 
the back part of the fire, and finish cooking it until it is done to 
your taste. After it is brown on one side, turn it over; and 
then, after that, you can turn it once or twice; the frequent 
turning does not make any difference after you have got it 
browneji on both sides and you can keep all the juice in. Turn 
it as soon as it is brown at first; have the hottest kind of a fire; 
get it brown on the under side as fast as you can; don't be afraid 
of burning it; then turn it over and brown it on the other 
side; after that you can turn it as often as you please. Some 
people like their steak rare, some medium rare, and some well 
done. To test steak, do not cut into it to see if it is done, but 
press your finger on it, on the substance of the steak. If you do 
that quickly you won't burn your finger. As long as the steak 
is very rare the fibre of the meat will be elastic, and directly you 
take your finger up the fibre will press up again; there will be 
no dent there. When it is medium rare just a little dent will re- 
main from the pressure, because the fibre is less elastic. When 
it is well done you can press on it and make a little hollow that 
will stay there. Do not season the meat until after it is done; 
don't put salt on any meat before cooking; you draw out the 
juice by salting it. 

Now for the seasoning of the steak. I have already said that 
to apply s^lt to the cut fibre of meat will be sure to draw out the 
juice, so that you do not want to season a steak until it is done. 
When it is done season it with salt, pepper and butter. The 
quantities you use depend upon the taste. That rule applies 
whether steak is broiled or fried. On that plate you will see the 
drippings, all that was in the frying pan. There is no juice of 
the meat there; it is simply browned fat. Whatever juice there 
was in the meat is still there. Broiled steak is cooked on pre- 
cisely the same principle. It is to be put just as near the fire as 
you can get it. After the broiled steak is browned on one side 
and then on the other, just as fast as you can brown it; don't be 
afraid of burning it; you need to watch it; then move it away 
from the fire, and let it cook as much as you like. Test it in the 
same way I told you to test fried steak. When it is done put it 
on a hot dish; put butter, pepper and salt on it, and serve it 
hot.« 

Question. What do you do when the fat drops in the fire and 
blazes? 

Miss Carson. Of course it will do that, but that will help 



38 BIENNIAL REPORT 

brown the steak. If it is possible to broil under the fire it is 
very much nicer. Sometimes the front of the stove is so ar- 
ranged that you can let it down and run the gridiron under it j 
befgre you begin to broil over the fire you can get the top of the 
fire very red and clear by throwing a little salt upon it;, that 
will help to destroy the odor. If the meat is frozen you. should 
put it in cold water to thaw before cooking it; you can not avoid 
in that case washing the meat. To return to the matter of 
pounding steak: If you pound or break the fibre of meat in any 
way you let the juice escape; that makes the meat dry. 

Question. What do you say to the notion that so many have^ 
that pounding the meat makes it tender? 

Miss Corson. You do nothing but break the fibre and save 
yourself the trouble of chewing the steak. To encourage laziness 
it is a very good idea. But remember, if you drive the juice out 
of the steak by pounding you destroy its nutriment. You need 
the juice in the steak, l^ow, there is a remedy for the tough- 
ness of steak, which I can give you, depending upon whether 
you like]^salad oil. If you do not, you ought to learn to, because 
it is one of the most nutritious and purest of the fats when it is 
perfectly good. Good sweet salad oil is preferable to any animal 
or vegetable fat for purposes of nutriment. There is no reason 
why you should not use salad oil on the score of health. A great 
many people object to it; they do not like the idea; they think 
it is rather foreign, and to some people it is distasteful, but they 
have very strong memories of childhood and another kind of oil. 
You know even that kind of oil in these days does not taste badly. 
Olive oil, the peanut oil, or lard oil, when they are fresh and 
sweet, are very desirable. To soften the fibre of the meat with 
vinegar and salad oil put on the platter about three tablespoon- 
fuls of salad oil, and half a teacupful of vinegar and a pinch of 
pepper; no salt. Put these on the platter; then lay the raw 
steak on the platter, and let it stand at least an hour; then turn 
it over and let it stand another hour. The longer you can let it 
stand, if it is in the daytime, turning it over every hour, the 
tenderer you will make it. The vinegar makes the fibre of the 
meat tender, and the oil keeps it so. That is, the vinegar soft- 
ens the fibre of the meat and the oil keeps it soft. If you want 
to prepare it for over night put it in the oil and vinegar aJbout 
6 o'clock, about supper time, and let it stand till bed time, 
then turn it over, and let it stand till morning. When you come 
to cook the steak do not wipe the oil and vinegar off ; simply let

what will run off, and then lay the meat on the gridiron and 
broil it, or fry it; there will be no taste perceptible if the oil is. 
good. 

CAKAMEL FOR COLORING SOUP. 

A heaping tablespoonful of common brown sugar if you have 
it; if not, use any kind of sugar; put it in the frying pan and 
stir it until it is dark brown; that is, until it is on the point of 
burning; see that it browns evenly. Then put in a tablespoon- 
ful of water, either hot or cold — it does not make any differ- 
ence; stir that until it is mixed with the sugar; then another 
tablespooeful, until you have used about half a cupful of water. 
If you should pour the water all in at once the sugar would 
simply boil over and burn you. Use about half a cupfull of 
water, adding it gradually, and stirring until the burnt sugar is 
dissolved. That gives you the caramel. Now, while I am mak- 
ing the caramel, I will describe to you the clarifying of the 
soup. 

CLARIFYINO SO^P. 

To clarify soup stock: For each quart use the white and shell 
of one egg and one tablespoonful of cold water. Put the white 
and shell of the egg and the cold water into the bottom of the 
saucepan, and mix them together. Then put in the soup stock. 
Set the saucepan over the fire and let it boil gradually, stirring 
it every minute to mix the egg thoroughly so that it will not 
cake on the bottom of the pan before it begins to boil. When 
you have the stock made quite hot, when it begins to boil, then 
you do not need to stir it; but let it boil tintil the egg rises to 
the surface in the form of a thick, white scum, and the soup un- 
derneath looks perfectly clear, like sherry wine. Then strain it. 
When the egg is thick and white, as you see this, and the soup 
is clear underneath, set a colander in an earthen bowl, put a 
folded towel, doubled, in it, pour the soup into the bowl, and let 
it run through the colander without squeezing the towel. You 
see that is a repetition of the direction I gave you for straining 
the soup in the first place. The egg is in the towel. IJ^ow, I am 
going to put some of the soup into a goblet before coloring it, so 
that you can see the natural color. A light straw-color is the 
proper color for clear soup. You will very often find clear soup 



40 BIENNIAL REPORT 

served to you, even at nice hotels, much darker than that; as dark 
as what I am going to make now, which is the proper color for 
the luncheon soups called bouillon. The coloring is a matter of 
taste. The clear soup, or consomme, is to be served plain like 
that, or with the addition of any macaroni paste, or poached 
eggs, and then it takes its name from the additional ingredient 
which goes into the clear soup. Julienne soup is served with 
strips of vegetables in it, as I may tell you in some subsequent 
lesson. 



LEOTUEE FOUETH. 



SLICED APPLE PIE. 



Half a pound of shortening to a pound of flour, the shortening 
to be rubbed into the flour with the hands until it is so 
thoroughly mixed that it seems like meal, but not at all melted 
or softened; then just enough cold water to make a pastry which 
will roll out. Eoll out the pastry and use it at once to line the 
pie plates. Fill the plates with sliced apples, or with any fruit 
or mince meat. To-day I shall use sliced apples. Sprinkle flour 
over the pastry, and then roll it out and line the plates; wet the 
lower crust to make the upper crust stick to it. Out two or 
three little slits in the upper crust. Take care not to press the 
outer edges of the crust together. After the upper crust has 
been put on the pie brush it with beaten e^gy if you wish it to 
be glossy when it is done. Then put it in a moderate oven and 
bake it for three-quarters of an hour, until you are very sure 
that the apple is done. You can tell that by trying the apple 
through the little cuts that you make in the pastry. This morn- 
ing, in making pastry, you remember that we rolled and folded 
it a number of times. I simply roll this out once, just enough 
to get it thin enough to use for my pie. First roll out the 
pastry, and cut off the cover for the top of the pie. Lay it one 
side, and then roll out the rest and use it for the pie, as I have 
already directed. Use Greening apples if you can get them. 
These are table apples. They are not so good for pies for two or 
three reasons. They will not keep their form when they are 
baked in the pie, and they may not be perfectly tender. These 
will break and grow very soft as soon as they begin to cook. 



UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA. 41 

I might, while I am making our pie, say a little about flour 
._^._ra use in the family. As a rule I use what is called 
pastry flour, best for pie crusts. Pastry flour has more starch 
in it than ordinary family flour, or bread flour. The starch 
is the interior of the grain. The family flour is the grain 
ground entire, only the husk being removed. From grain 
ground in that way none of the nutritious elements are removed. 
You get a greater proportion of gluten, and some of the 
mineral elements of the grain that lie close to the husk; the 
flour that has an excess, of gluten in it will absorb more water 
than pastry flour, or flour composed chiefly of starch, and it 
will make a tougher dough, either in the form of pie crust or 
bread than a flour which has the most starch in it. It is 
more nutritious than starchy flour, so that if you want tender, 
rather white pastry and bread, you must make up your minds 
to sacrifice some of the nutritious elements of the flour. All 
through the West the flour which is marketed is made, I think, 
from the entire wheat, and that is more thoroughly good, and 
more nutritious, than the so-called choice pastry flour. In the 
West you have a better flour than we at the East do, if we de- 
pend upon the Eastern mills. There are some very good brands 
of flour made in New York State, but as a rule they are not so 
full of gluten and not so nutritious as the Western flours. Where 
flour is made from winter wheat, which lies in the ground all 
winter long and gathers more of the mineral elements of the 
soil than spring wheat does, the flour is superior. 

The pie is now heaped full of sliced apples by using about half 
-a dozen rather small apples. I suppose you think this is a rather 
extravagant way to make a pie, but you do not need to put so 
many apples in unless you want to; we want a nice thick pie. 
This is cinnamon that I am using for flavoring. Put two heap- 
ing tablespoonfuls of sugar on top of the apples in the pie. Fi- 
nally brush the top of the pie, either with beaten egg or with a 
little sugar and water dissolved, and put it into the oven to bake. 

BREAD MAKING. 

Now take your recipe for bread making. Use the compressed 
yeast which you buy at the grocery store. For two small loaves 
of bread or a large pan of biscuit use a whole cake of yeast. Dis- 
solve the yeast in lukewarm water, a cupful of lukewarm water. 
Then add enough flour to form a thick batter; that will be about 
a cupful of flour; a thick batter which will cling to the mixing 
6 



42 BIENNIAL REPORT 

spoon when you lift the spoon and let a drop fall on the surface. 
Cover the bowl with a towel folded several times, or a thick 
cloth, so that all the heat can be retained. Then set the bowl 
somewhere near the fire, in a place not too hot to bear your hand, 
and let it stand for about half an hour, or until the batter is light 
and foamy. Keep the bowl covered all the time, and take care 
that you do not have it in too hot a place. Don't have it in a 
place where you can not bear your hand. After the sponge 
— as the batter is called — is light and foaming, mix in another 
cupful of lukewarm water in which a teaspoonful of salt is dis- 
solved. After the second cupful of lukewarm water with the 
teaspoonful of salt dissolved in it, add enough flour to form a 
dough stiff enough to knead with the hands. Knead the dough 
on the board for just five minutes. Some good housekeepers 
would declare that just five minutes' kneading is flying in the 
face of Providence in the way of bread making, but I assure 
you it is enough. That is, it is enough to give you bread of a 
firm, fine grain, perfectly even in its consistency. It won't be 
full of large, uneven holes; it will be firm, fine bread. After 
you have kneaded the bread five minutes make it up in a 
little loaf, or two loaves, as you like; put them in small iron 
pans, buttered — black iron bread pans — and set them again 
by the fire, where you can bear your hand, and let the little 
loaves of dough rise until they are just twice as large as when 
you put them down. That generally will take about half an 
hour if the yeast is good. Brush the loaves over the top with 
a little melted butter, or with a teaspoonful of sugar dissolved 
in water. Put them in the oven and bake them. The bread 
is to be baked until you can run a sharp knife or trussing 
needle in through the thickest part of the loaf without the bread 
sticking in any way. If the needle or knife comes out clean and 
bright the bread is done. It may take from half an hour to an 
hour to bake the bread. In the stove that I used the first morn- 
ing over in the other building I have baked a loaf of bread, the 
size of those I am going to show you, in eleven minutes. I had 
not realized that bread could be baked thoroughly in so short a 
time, but one day in ^N^orthampton, Mass. , one of my class timed 
the baking of the bread. A loaf of bread of that size was baked 
in eleven minutes. This same bread dough you «an make up in 
the form of little rolls. I will make part of it up in rolls. Of 
course you will understand that the smaller the piece of dough 
the more rapidly it will rise the second time, and the quicker 



i ^ 

UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA. 43 

you will be enabled to bake it. So if you are in a hurry, and 
want bread baked quickly, you will make it in the form of little 
rolls; when I make the rolls I will describe the process. 

Question. Should bread be baked a long or a short time 1 

Miss Corson. The sooner it can be baked the better. There 
is no special object to be gained in the baking of bread except 
to thoroughly cook the dough. It can not affect the nutriment 
of the flour very much whether it takes a longer or a shorter 
time. The nutriment of the flour might be slightly wasted if it 
took a very long time. There is no objection to baking bread as 
quickly as it can be done. 

Now before I begin to make the pudding I will answer a ques- 
tion that has been asked about the best yeast and the quick 
rising of bread. The object of raising bread is simply to make 
it digestible by separating the mass of the dough. If it is firm 
and solid, that is, if the bread is heavy, it can not be easily 
penetrated by the gastric juice, and consequently is indigesti- 
ble. So that the most healthy bread is that which is sufficiently 
light and porous to allow the gastric juice to penetrate it easily. 
Only a mechanical operation is required to make the bread light. 
Now that process which will most quickly make the bread dough 
light is the most desirable. The longer you take to raise bread, 
the more slowly you raise, the more of the nutriment of the flour 
you destroy by the process of fermentation that lightens the 
bread. The yeast combining with water at a certain tempera- 
ture causes fermentation, and from that fermentation carbolic 
acid gas is evolved, which forces its way up through the dough 
and, fills it with tittle bubbles, — in other words, makes it light. 
Now the more quickly you can accomplish tli^t fermentation, or 
rather lightening of the dough by the formation of little air 
cells, the more you will pre'serve the nutriment of the flour. 

The idea prevails to some extent that if ladies use as much 
yeast as I have to-day the bread will taste of the yeast. It will 
not if the yeast is fresh. If the yeast is old or sour it will taste. 
But you can use as much as I have shown you and not have the 
bread taste after it is done. You see my object in using a great 
deal of yeast, proportionately, is to accomplish the lightening of 
the dough in a Tery short time. The best bread that ever was 
made or that ever was put on the market was raised mechani- 
cally, without the action of yeast; it was called aerated bread. 
It was bread dough lightened by a mechanical process. Car- 
bonic acid gas was driven into the dough by machinery after the 



44 BIENNIAL REPORT 

flour was mixed with salt water; and the bread made was very 
light and every particle of the nourishment preserved in that 
way. 

Question. Do you ever put sugar in bread*? 

Miss Corson. You can put in anything you like. You can 
put sugar, or milk, or anything you like in the bread to vary it. 
I will use nothing to-day but yeast, flour, water, and salt. This 
is perfectly plain, wholesome bread. You put milk in bread 
and it makes it dry quicker. Vienna bread, which is made 
partly of milk, dries more quickly than any other bread that is 
made. You can make any variation you like from the recipe I 
have given you. I have given you a perfectly plain home-made 
bread. 

Question. Do you ever scald the flour for bread ? 

Miss Corson. You can scald the flour if you wish, but you 
do not accomplish any special purpose by it. In the winter 
time, if you heat the flour before you mix it with yeast and 
warm water, you increase the rapidity with which the bread 
dough rises. 

Question. How would you make brown bread — ordinary gra- 
ham bread? 

Miss Corson. Use graham flour; mix your white flour with it, if 
it is for graham bread proper; if it is for graham gems use simply 
graham flour, water and salt, beaten together. Graham flour, 
salt and water beaten together into a form and baked in little 
buttered tins is the graham bread pure and simple of the Gra- 
hamites. It is not necessary to knead bread more than once to 
secure lightness. I have already said that the longer you pro- 
long the process of bread making the more of the nourishment 
of the flour you destroy. You will see when the bread is baked 
to-day, if we are fortunate in our baking, that the bread is per- 
fectly light and of even grain. 

BREAD AND APPLE PUDDING. 

Stale bread cut in slices or small pieces, fill a pudding dish of 
medium size, only three eggs, or if eggs are very dear, four 
tablespoonfuls of sugar, and a pint of milk, or enough more milk 
to saturate the bread. If the bread is very stale and dry you 
will have to use a pint and a half of milk. Three eggs, a pint 
of milk, four tablespoons of sugar, will make about a quart of 
liquid. The custard you pour over the bread; let the custard 



UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA. 45 

soak into the bread; then on the top of the pudding put a layer 
of fruit about an inch thick. You may vary the fruit, using 
sliced apples, or dried apples which have been soaked over night, 
and then stewed tender, dried peaches treated in the same way, 
or canned peaches, canned pears — any fruit you like. In the 
summer, in berry season, use berries. If the fruit is sour 
sprinkle it with sugar; then put the pudding in the oven and 
bake it. You can use dried fruit with this pudding, such as 
raisins or currants, but you put the fruit in through the pudding 
instead of on top. If you want to make the pudding particularly 
good you will separate the white and yolks of the eggs, mix the 
yolks of the eggs with the milk and sugar; save the whites until 
the pudding is done; in that case you have to use a little more 
milk proportionately. Save the whites until the pudding is 
done, then beat them to a stiff froth and add to it three heaping 
tablespoons of powdered sugar, very gently mixing them, 
just as I mixed that light omelette yesterday. That makes what 
is called a meringue. Put the meringue over the top of the pud- 
ding after it is done; run it through the oven for about a minute, 
just long enough to color it slightly, and then serve the pudding. 
If you want the pudding entirely smooth when it is done, you 
must break the bread up in the custard before you bake it. My 
way is simply to saturate the bread with the custard. You can 
beat it if you wish. The pudding will be slightly liquid, like 
bread pudding, and then the fruit, if it is juicy, makes it still 
more liquid, and if you add the meringue^ that of itself is a 
sauce. You will notice, as a rule, that I make everything as 
plain as possible, because I wish to demonstrate that plain 
dishes cooked with simple and few materials, can be very good. 
Perforated tin pie plates bake very nicely. Of course you want 
to take care to have the bottom crust thick enough, so that none 
of the juice from fruit pies will run through. If the oven is 
very hot on the bottom, it will not do to set a pie on the very 
bottom; a grating must be used. You will have to use your 
judgment about baking, watching the pie, and taking care that 
it does not get burnt. 

(Eeturning to the bread making. Miss Corson continued:) 
Now 1 am going to put the second cup of water and flour inta 
the dough. You want to remember, in raising bread, to keep 
it always at the same temperature until you get it light. It 
should be set where you can put your hand without burning. 
Keep the bowl, containing the sponge, just warm. You don't 



46 BIENNIAL REPORT 

want it anywhere where it will get so hot as to scald the sponge. 
You can set the bowl in winter over boiling water to keep the 
temperature equal. 

(A question was asked in regard to rhubarb pie.) 

Miss Corson. Some ladies put the rhubarb raw into the pies 
when they make rhubarb pies, trusting to its cooking while the 
crust is baking; others stew it with sugar before they put itinth© 
pies. When it comes in from the market it should be cut in 
little pieces about half an inch long, and the outside, or thin 
skin, stripped off. It requires a great deal of sugar, whether 
you put it into the pie uncooked, or you first cook it. It makes 
an exceedingly nice acid pie. Usually the best way is to stew 
it first before you put it in the pie. That gives it to you in the 
form of a pulp. If you put it raw into the pie, to a certain ex- 
tent the form is perfect, that is, it retains its little block-like 
shape after it is cooked. 

(The bread now being ready to knead. Miss Corson recurred 
to that subject.) 

I will take for the dough three cups of flour, about three heap- 
ing cupfuls besides the first one. There was an old adage to the 
effect that some imaginary substance called '-elbow grease'' 
was necessary in kneading bread. I presume that is another 
name for force. But there is no special strength necessary. The 
bread is kneaded for the purpose of entangling a little more air 
in it, and you accomplish that by folding and refolding it, as I 
am doing; just using enough flour to keep it from sticking to 
your hands. In five minutes you will find that you have a rath- 
er smooth, soft dough, that does not stick to your hands. That 
is all you want. You will always find perfectly good yeast in 
any town, or you can make the yeast yourself. 

Question. If you use twice as much flour would you use twice 
as much yeast ? 

Miss Corson. If you want to raise the bread quickly you 
can increase the quantity of yeast in the same proportion that I 
have given it you here to-day, until you reach as much as six or 
seven pounds of flour, and then you would not need to use pro- 
portionately as much yeast. You could diminish the quantity a 
little. You see, the object of using plenty of yeast is to get the 
bread raised quickly. 

Question. Doesn't home-made yeast make heartier bread than 
the other ? 

Miss Corson. It makes bread less digestible — it may be 



UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA. 47 

heartier in that sense j the Irishman does not like his potatoes 
quite done; he thinks them heartier when they are somewhat 
indigestible. There could not be more nutritious or wholesome 
bread than this quickly raised bread. I have given you several 
very good reasons for raising bread as quickly as possible. 
Bread raised more slowly is not so nutritious, because some of 
the nutritive elements are destroyed in the fermentation ^fhich 
goes on in the slow process. 

To make rolls, take small pieces of dough and make them 
round, and cut them nearly through the centre. Put the rolls 
in a buttered pan; cover them up with a cloth and let them rise 
double their original size, where you can bear your hand. 
Then bake them. Let the dough always rise until it is twice its 
size before baking. I think I have already explained to you 
that if you want the br6ad or roll glossy you can brush it with 
sugar and water, or melted butter. These rolls will be set on the 
top of the stove to rise, just like bread. As soon as they are 
twice their size they go into the oven to bake. 

Question. Do you ever use any shortening in the rolls ? 

Miss Corson. You can use it if you want to. Knead butter in 
the part of the dough that is designed for rolls — say a table- 
spoonful of butter; put it in when you are doing the five minutes' 
kneading. There is no reason why you should not knead in 
anything that your fancy calls for, providing it is edible. 

Now I. will show you how you can prevent the juice running 
out of fruit pies. For fruit pies — pies made in the summer 
time, of juicy fruits — better use no under crust. Take a deep 
dish; put the fruit into the dish, heaping it a little, just as I 
heaped the apples; wet the edges of the dish with cold water; 
lay the pastry on the dish and press it very slightly, not on the 
edge itself, because that makes the pastry heavy, but just inside 
of the edge. As I press it I leave the edge intact; press the 
pastry against the dish all the way round; then with your finger 
make a little groove all the way round your pie, inside the edge 
of the crust; then, with a little knife, cut holes in the groove. JSTo w, 
when the juice of the fruit boils out, as it will, instead of forcing 
its way out of the edges, the crust will be held upon the wet 
dish, and the fruit juice will boil out in the little groove and 
stay there. To serve the pie, you cut the upper crust with a 
sharp knife, and serve with a spoon, taking a piece of crust and 
plenty of fruit out on each plate. ISo under crust is there. If 
you have an under crust with very juicy pie it will be pretty 



48 BIENNIAL REPORT 

sure to be soggy and heavy. The English way of serving these 
pies is a very nice one, and is, as I have described, with whipped 
cream. Serve whipped cream with a fruit pie. Among other 
nice things that we can not get in this country is Devonshire 
cream, which is a cream almost as thick as the hard sauce you 
make by mixing powdered sugar and egg together; it is thick 
enough almost to cut. We can not get that cream here, but use 
thick, nice cream, sweetened or not, as you like. One of my 
English friends, who first taught me this way of serving pie, said 
that at her home they never sweetened the cream; they simply 
whipped it to a froth and served it piled up on a dish by the side 
of the pie. The pie was taken out on a plate, and then two or 
three spoonfuls of this whipped cream laid on the plate by the 
side of the pie. You can sweeten it if you like. 

MERINGUE. 

I will next make a meringue. I have already told you to use 
the whites of three eggs, three tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar — 
and that really must be pulverized very fine and sifted. In beat- 
ing the eggs you can always get them light very quickly, if they 
are reasonably cold in the beginning, by beating with a change 
of movement. Beat until your hand grows tired, and then simply 
change the way you hold the beater. Don't stop beating. Of 
course you can use any kind of an egg-whip you like. This 
which I use is made of twisted wire. Only take care to have the 
egg beaten entirely stiff. Do not have any liquid egg in tlfe 
bottom of the bowl. In the summer time you can cool the egg 
by putting in a little pinch of salt if it does not beat stiff at once. 
I would not advise using an egg that had the least odor about it. 
As soon as the custard in the pudding is done we are going to 
take the pudding out of the oven, and put the meringue on the 
top, whether the apples are done or not. It does not do any harm 
to stop beating for awhile. Mix this, using a cutting motion, 
not a stirring motion. Mix until the sugar and egg are smoothly 
blended, and the meringue Is ready to use.

LECTUEE FIFTH. 



Our lesson this morning is cream of salmon; shoulder of 
lamb, boned and roasted; force meat or stuJBfingfor roast meats; 
potatoes, boiled and baked; and cheese crusts. I shall begin 
with the lamb or mutton. 

Eemove the bone first, then stuff and bake the meat, as I have 
no facilities for roasting with this stove; but I will have some- 
thing to say about the process of roasting in the course of the 
lesson. A great many of the ladies think that the shoulder or fore 
quarters of meat is not so desirable a piece for use as the loin 
or hind quarter, but that is a mistake. In the first place the 
proportion of bone in the fore quarter is very much less than in 
the hind quarter. In one lesson that I gave, about a week ago, 
at Cleveland, I had a butcher remove all the bones from a fore 
quarter weighing between five and six pounds, and then weighed 
the bones: They weighed a pound and a quarter. I also had 
him remove the bones from the hind quarters and weighed them, 
and they weighed more. The meat of the fore quarter is sweeter, 
and quite as nutritious as the meat of the hind quarter, and the 
fore quarter is always cheaper. So that, you see, on the score of 
flavor and economy, the fore quarter is more desirable for use 
than the hind quarter. In England, where mutton is always in 
perfection, it is thafore quarter or shoulder of mutton that is 
served to guests, and the hind quarter is the one that is used for 
the family dinner. 

To make the dish which I am going to prepare this morning, 
I have had the whole quarter brought in so that I can show you 
how the shoulder should be cut off. Simply with a large piece of 
the outside skin attached. Usually the butcher might cut the 
shoulder square off close, but I want this large piece of skin for 
stuffing. There is a natural division between the shoulder and 
the ribs, so that the shoulder comes off with perfect ease. If you 
buy an entire fore quarter like that you will have the butcher 
cut off the shoulder for roasting or baking, then let him cut the 
neck in rather small pieces for stews or mutton broth. Wh;it is 
called the rack or ribs would be cut into chops for broiling or 
frying, and the breast would be cut off entire to be stewed or 
roasted or baked. A very nice way to prepare the breast is to 
have the bones all taken out, spread a layer of nice force 

7 



50 BIENNIAL REPORT 

meat or stuffing over it, roll it up, and tie it. Then it can be 
baked, or roasted, or stewed. Another nice way to cook the 
breast is to boil it until it is tender enough to enable you to pull 
the bones out without any difficulty; then take out all the bones, 
put it on a platter, set another platter on top of it with a heavy 
weight on the top platter, and press it until it is cold. Then 
cut it in rather small pieces, about two or three inches square, 
and bread and fry it. The process of breading and frying is^ 
accomplished in this way. You have cracker crumbs — cracker 
crumbs rolled and sifted — or bread crumbs, stale bread, dried 
in the oven and rolled and sifted, in a large dish. In another 
dish beat a couple of eggs until they are liquid. It does not 
need to be frothy, but simply to have the substance of the egg 
well broken; then dip the little pieces of boiled lamb, first in the 
cracker dust, then in the beaten egg, then again in the cracker 
dust. That is called breading. To fry properly, so that you 
have no grease, you want the frying kettle half full of fat. You 
don't want a little fat in a frying pan, but a frying kettle like 
that which you use in frying doughnuts. Put the kettle over 
the fire and let the fat get hot, that is, let it get so hot that it 
begins to smoke. When the fat begins to smoke you plunge 
whatever article you wish to fry into it. If you take the pre- 
caution to do that, have plenty of fat and let it get smoking hot 
and then fry in it, you will never have anything greasy. The 
action of the hot fat at once so carbonizes the surface of what 
you wish to fry, and prevents the soaking of the fat. Fry what- 
ever article you are treating until it is a light brown, then take it 
out of the fat with a skimmer, and lay it on brown paper for a 
moment — coarse brown paper — and that will absorb the very 
little fat on the surface. It will be perfectly free from grease. 
You can season before you bread an article, or you can season 
the bread crumbs or cracker dust which you use in breading, 
just as you like. Or, after the article is fried you can season it 
with salt and pepper. Some things are seasoned after the fry- 
ing — for instance, Saratoga i)otatoes — they are always salted 
after frying. You can make bread crumbs very fine by using 
a fine sieve and sifting. If you have cracker meal already pre- 
pared you will see that it is as fine as Indian meal; it is sold in the 
grocery stores and at the cracker factories, aud it is cheaper to 
buy cracker dust or cracker meal than it is to make it at home, 
if you buy the whole crackers, because, of course the manufac- 
■ turers can afford to use their broken crackers — they are all per- 



UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA. 61 

fectly good — in making cracker meal and sell that very much 
cheaper than they can sell the whole crackers. The question of 
the digestibility of fried articles of food is very often raised. 
You understand that the hard fried surface is less digestible 
than any soft surface, and many fried articles are indigestible 
because of the quantity of grease they contain. If you fry in 
the way I have told you, you will not have that excess of grease. 

To take the bone from the shoulder, first cut from the inside 
and take out the shoulder blade, cutting from the inside, avoid- 
ing as far as possible cutting through the skin on the outside. 
The butcher will always^ do this for you probably, if you tell him 
about what you want done. First, the shoulder blade is taken 
out, then the bone which follows down "along the leg. After the 
shoulder blade is taken out put it into a kettle of water, over 
the tire, and boil it for awhile until you can scrape all the meat 
off of it. You will have to use it in finishing the dish. After 
taking out the shoulder blade the cutting must all be done from 
the inside. There will be two or three places where you may 
possibly cut through the skin, where it is drawn very close over 
the bone, but cut as little as possible. When the meat is freshly 
killed before the skin is dried, you may not always cut through 
there, but where the skin is dried fast to the bone you will have 
to. This may seem a slight waste of time, but this dish is desir- 
able for several reasons. In the first place, the bone being en- 
tirely taken out you can carve it without any waste whatever and 
with a great deal of erase. In the next place it gives you a very 
ornamental dish. In fact, I am going to show you how to make 
a duck out of it. And as I say, if you get the butcher to do it, it 
^will not make any difference to you if it does take time. 

Always in sewing meat or poultry, ladies, take very large 
stitches, not with fine thread. Use cord, so that you can see where 
the threads are when the meat is done. Any kind of a large 
needle will answer for sewing, large enough to carry your cord. 
Always leave long ends too. 

To stuff the meat, season it nicely with pepper and salt and 
any herb that you are going to use in making stuffing. Sage, of 
course, would be very good with fat meat; put onion in the 
stuffing to make it imitate duck. For a force meat of bread, a 
teaspoonful of chopped onion; fry it in a tablespoonful of butter 
until it is light brown. While the onion is frying soak a cupful 
of stale bread in cold water until it is soft, then squeeze out the 
water. Put the soaked bread with the fried onion, add a tea- 



52 BIENNIAL REPOKT 

spoonful of salt, a teaspoonful of any herb that you decide for 
seasoning, any dried sweet herb, half a saltspoonful of pepper? 
and stir all these ingredients over the fire until they are scald- 
ing hot. Use that force meat for stuffing any kind of meat or 
poultry. Of course there are a great many ways of making 
force meats; this is only one, and a very simple one. Another 
good stuffing for duck or for this dish, if you wish it more closely 
to imitate duck, would be to increase the quantity of onion — 
use much more onion, half a cupful of onion, or even more when 
you want to make onion stuffing. Another way is to use dry 
bread without cooking, a chopped oniop, herbs, butter; some 
ladies like to put an egg in stuffing. There are a great many 
different methods of making it. Cold, chopped meat is very 
nice added to stuffing or dressing. 

After the shoulder is stuffed thus, run a needle entirely round 
the edge in a large, over-hand stitch, so that you can draw it up 
like a purse; stitches at least an inch and a half long. That 
draws the edge up. Then take two or three stitches in such a 
way as to hold the stuffing in. Remember always to leave long 
ends in tying the cord used in sewing. Then curl the leg up 
like the neck of a duck and fasten with a cord. After it is pre- 
pared like that it is to be put into a pan in the oven, or l)efore a 
hot fire, and browned quickly on the outside. It may be sea- 
soned after it is browned. There will be a little drippings in 
the pan; baste it with the drippings; bake it or roast it, allow- 
ing, if you want it well done, about twenty minutes to the pound. 
A shoulder like that will weigh about two pounds and a half or 
three pounds. It will do man hour's time in a pretty quick oven; 
in an hour and a half in a moderate one. Use no water in the, 
baking pan, because water never can get as hot as the fat out- 
side of the meat. The temperature of the hot fat is higher than 
the temperature of hot water, and the result of putting water 
around meat in a baking pan is to draw out the juice. The ob- 
ject is to keep all the juice in the meat. You will always find 
that there will be drippings enough from any ordinary cut of 
meat for the purpose of basting. If you have an absolutely 
lean piece of meat pour about a couple of tablespoonfuls of 
drippings, or butter, in the baking pan, but no water, and use 
the drippings lor basting. A nice gravy is very easily made 
from the drii)pings in the pan. I will tell you about that later. 
If the meat appears to be baking too quickly, if there is any 
danger of its burning, put a sheet of buttered paper over it. 



UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA. 63 

Baste the meat every fifteen or twenty minutes. You can drench 
it with flour, just before basting, if you want to. That gives it a 
rough surface. The flour browns with the fat. If you are 
basting with water of course the flour would not brown so 
quickly. I think I have given you good reasons for not basting 
it with water. 

CREAM OF SALMON. 

A cupful of boiled salmon separated from the skin and bone 
and rubbed through a sieve with a potato masher, mixed with a 
quart of cream soup, gives you cream of salmon. Any of the 
ladies who have seen cream sauce made will understand the 
making of the cream soup. Put a slice of salmon that will make 
a cupful, over the fire in enough boiling water to cover it, with 
a heaping tablespoonful of salt, and boil it until the flakes 
separate. That will be perhaps ten minutes. Watch it a little. 
When the flakes separate drain it, take away the skin and bones 
and put it into a fine colander or stout wire sieve, and rub it 
through with a potato masher. 

Question. Do you use canned salmon ? 

Miss Corson. Yes, you can use canned salmon. That is al- 
ready cooked, and you simply would rub it through the sieve. 
The fresh salmon is to be boiled in salted water. If you use 
canned salmon you do not need to boil it. After the salmon is 
rubbed through the sieve it is called puree or pulp of salmon. . 

Now to make a quart of cream soup: For each quart of soup 
put in the sauce pan a heaping tablespoonful of butter, a heaping 
tablespoonful of flour; put them over the fire and stir them until 
they are quite smooth. Then begin to add hot milk, half a cup- 
ful at a time, stirring each half cupful smoothly with the butter 
and flour before you add any more, till you have added a quart, 
or if milk is scarce a pint of milk" and a pint of water. If you 
haven^t any milk at all, a quart of water. That gives you a 
white soup, if you add simply water; if you add milk it is called 
cream soup. If you are very fortunate and have lots of cream, 
in place of some of the milk, use cream, and then you will have 
genuine cream soup. After the milk or water is all added, then 
season the soup palatably with salt and pepper — white pepper- 
I have told you about white pepper. It is to be had at all the 
grocery stores; it costs no more than black pepper and is very 
much nicer for any white soup or white sauce. Salt and pepper 



64 BIENNIAL REPORT 

to taste, and a very little grated nutmeg; a quarter of a salt- 
spoonfal, a little pinch of grated nutmeg. After the soup is 
seasoned stir in the salmon. I have cold you already how to pre- 
pare the salmon. Stir the soup constantly until it boils for a 
couple of minutes. By that time you will find that the salmon 
is stirred smoothly all through it. Then it will be ready to serve? 
and it is very good. You can use any other kind of fish in the 
same way, and your soup will take its name from the fish that 
you use. Halibut or codfish, trout or any fish. Only remember 
if you want the soup to be white you must use the white part of 
the fish. For instance, if you had a large dark fish you would 
want to take off the brown parts and .use only the white parts. 
Otherwise the brown parts of the fish will color the soup. You 
can use cream soup as the basis for vegetable soups that are very 
nice. Prepare the vegetables in the same way; boil them, and 
rub them through a sieve with a potato masher. Then stir them 
into the cream soup. Use asparagus, celery, cucumbers, green 
peas, striug beans, Jerusalem artichokes, — those little root arti- 
chokes, — any vegetable, iu fact, varying the quantity of vegetable 
in this way. You will find that some vegetables will give a 
much more decided flavor than others. For instance, celery has 
a very strong flavor, and cucumbers have rather a decided flavor- 
You want to use enough vegetables to flavor the soup, if it is a 
white vegetable. If it is a vegetable that has a decided color 
like carrots, for instance, or beets, — by the way, beets make a de- 
licious soup, and a very pretty one is made with spinach, — you 
want to use enough to color the soup. The beets, boiled so that 
all the color is preserved, and then rubbed through a sieve, make 
a very pretty soup. One of our New York pupils calls it a 
'^pink velvet soup." Spinach makes a very nice green soup if 
it is properly boiled. We shall try to get some spinach for one 
of the lessons. We have puree of spinach on our list, and if we 
can get any spinach I will show you how to boil it so as to keep 
its color. 

BOILED POTATOES. 

The boiling of potatoes is a very simple operation, but there 
is a good deal of talking to be done in connection with it. It 
does not make any difference whether you use hot water or cold 
in boiling potatoes. What you want to watch is the stage at 
which you take the potatoes out of the water. That is what 
determines whether they are to be mealy or not. The cause of 



UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA. 65 

the potatoes being mealy is the ruptare of the starch cells and 
the escape of the steam just at the right moment, just when the - 
potatoes are tender; and if «,^ou leave them in the water after 
they are tender, then the membrane of the starch cells being 
broken permits the water to penetrate; even if the skins are not 
cut or broken, the moisture in the starch cells themselves will 
condense and make the potato heavy, so that you want to give 
the steam a chance to escape as soon as the potatoes are tender. 
If you will do that you are sure of mealy potatoes, provided the 
potatoes are ripe. Unripe potatoes, or new potatoes, or sprout- 
ed or frosted potatoes, you cannot well make mealy, because the 
starch cells in the new potatoes are not fully matured, in the old 
sprouted potatoes they are disorganized, especially as the little 
sprouts take up the nutritive properties which enable them to 
grow. But if you use ripe potatoes, before they are beginning 
to sprout, and pour the water off of them when they are tender 
and allow the steam to escape, you will be sure to have the pota-* 
toes mealy, unless they are watery potatoes; the ordinary mar- 
ket potatoes will be sure to be mealy, l^ow you can insure the 
escape of the steam by draining the potatoes and covering them 
with a towel folded several times; that is, draining off all the 
water as soon as the potatoes are tender enough to enable you to 
run a fork through them. Do not wait until they begin to break 
apart, because by that time the starch cells are being broken up, 
and the water will have begun to penetrate to the interior of the 
potato. 

After boiling the potatoes, either ia cold or hot water, until 
they are tender, drain them and put a folded towel over them in 
the sauce pan. Set the sauce pan on the back part of the stove 
where the potatoes can not burn, or put it up on a brick on the 
back part of the stove. The potatoes may be peeled or not, as 
you choose; if you peel the potatoes in the most careful way, 
that is, cutting the thinnest possible skin off, you will waste at 
least an ounce in every pound. A very good way to peel pota- 
toes is to take off just a little rim of the skin all around them 
and boil them; then if you want to peel them before they go to 
the table, it will be easy to strip off the two pieces of skin re- 
maining. In order to save time I shall put the potatoes into 
boiling water enough to cover them, with a tablespoonful of 
salt. Take about a quart of water and a tablespoonful of salt. 
I have already said that as soon as the potatoes are tender 
enough to pierce with a fork, not when they are beginning to 



56 BIENNIAL REPORT 

break, and they are drained, cover them with a cloth and keep 
them hot as long as you like. In about three or four minutes 
after they have been covered with the cloth they will begin to 
grow mealy, as the steam escapes; and you can keep them hot 
and mealy for three or four hours. It makes very little differ- 
ence with potatoes, although with some kinds of vegetables it 
makes a decided difference, whether you boil them in hard or 
soft water. But as a rule soft water is best for boiling vegeta- 
bles. You can always soften the water by putting a very little 
carbonate of soda in it, to counteract the extreme hardness of 
the water, which is caused by lime or mineral elements. The 
hardness of water slightly hardens the surface of vegetables, but 
it has an entirely different action on meats. It slightly hardens 
the surface — not enough to make the vegetable tough, by any 
means, but enough to retain all the juices and all the flavors. 
Do not have the potatoes tightly covered after they are cooked, 
'because the steam will condense on tRe inside of the cover and 
fall back on the potatoes, thus making them watery. In serving- 
potatoes on the table after they are cooked, do not put a cover 
on the dish; put a folded napkin over the potatoes. Do not put 
the dish cover on — it will h^ve the same effect that it would 
have if you put the cover on the pot. The steam arising would 
condense, and fall back on the potatoes in the form of moisture,, 
and make the potatoes watery. 

In baking potatoes, the same general principles apply. That 
is, at the moment when the potatoes are tender — and that of 
course depends upon the oven in which you bake them — the 
starch cells are ruptured and the moisture is at the point of es- 
caping if you give it vent by slightly breaking the potato, then 
the potatoes will keep mealy for a little while. But baked pota- 
toes deteriorate every moment they stand after they are tender. 
You should serve baked potatoes just the moment they are done, 
if you want them to be perfect. If you wrap them up in a nap- 
kin it keeps in the steam. The longer they stand, the more of 
the hard skin forms on them, and if you let them stand for half 
an hour or more you find the skin sometimes a sixteenth of an 
inch thick. You can take a little slice off the end without 
breaking them, to permit the escape of the steam. But serve 
them just as quick as you can. In sending them to the table do 
not put the dish cover on them. Throw a napkin over them to 
keep the heat in. I have found that in baking potatoes that the 
hotter the oven the better the potatoes would be; that is, the 



UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA. 57 

more quickly they would be baked. I have been able to bake 
them sometimes in twenty minutes. 

To soak potatoes in cold water restores a little of their moist- 
ure that may have been lost by the natural evaporation. For 
instanr>e, late in the winter you will find potatoes slightly shriv- 
eled. That is caused by the escape of the moisture. If you 
had weighed them in the fall, and weighed them again at that 
time you would find they weighed less. To soak them for an 
hour or more before you cook them is to restore that wasted 
water and to increase the substance of the potato. There is 
very little nutriment lost in the waste of the moisture; it is only 
the bulk of the potato. You do not need to salt the water in 
which the potatoes are soaked. The only effect of salting water 
would be to make it colder. In soaking green vegetables it is 
well to salt the water, because if there are any insects in the 
vegetables they are killed by the action of the salt. In lettuce, 
or cabbage, or cauliflower, there are insects that hide away 
among the leaves, and salt kills them. In regard to the soaking 
of the green vegetables, of course, directly the insects* are dead 
they naturally fall of their own weight from among the leaves. 
But if the leaves are closely packed, as sometimes they are in 
cabbage or lettuce; you want to hold the vegetable by the root 
and turn it up and with your hands separate the leaves without 
tearing; if lettuce is used, take care not to tear them; if cauli- 
flower is being washed, take hold of the root and shake it well 
through the water, so that the motion will dislodge the little 
creatures. 

CHEESE CRUSTS. 

For cheese crusts use bread that is a day or two old, baker's 
bread or home-made bread; baker's bread is the best for toast of 
all kinds, and this is a sort of toast. Cut the bread in even slices, 
rather small, cutting off the crusts. There is no waste in doing 
that, for I have already told you how to use up pieces of stale 
bread by making them into crumbs. Grate some cheese so that 
you have a tablespoonful of cheese for each little slice of bread. 
On each of the little pieces of bread put a tablespoonful of the 
grated cheese, a very little dust of pepper and salt and a small 
piece of butter not larger than a white dried bean. Put the pieces 
of bread in a pan, set the pan in a rather quick oven, and just 
brown the cheese crusts. If the oven is in a good condition it will 
toast the bread and brown the cheese in about ten minutes, or 
8 



58 BIENNIAL REPORT 

even less; they are #ery good, those little chese crusts. You can 
use them either hot or cold. They are a very nice supper dish. 
They are very good with salad at dinner, with any green salad. 
Of course, if you serve them hot the cheese is a little more tender. 
Any kind of cheese will answer for making the crusts. I think 
that the ordinary American factory cheese is about as good as 
a,ny other cheese. You do not want a rich expensive cheese for 
cheese crusts. 

(At this point the stuffed shoulder of mutton was brought 
forth, done, the fan-shaped shoulder blade being stuck in to rep- 
resent the tail of the duck, which the whole dish strongly re- 
sembled.) 

GRAVY FOR MEAT. 

There are about two tablespoonfuls of drippiings in the pan. 
I am going to put a heaping tablespoonful of flour with it and 
stir until it is brown; then I am goiifg to stir in gradually about 
a pint of boiling water, and season it with s^lt and pepper, and 
then I will send it down and show it to you. Make gravy in 
this way for any baked meat. 



LECTUEE SIXTH. 

Our first dish this afternoon, ladies, will be. roast chicken. 
The lesson will include fish and poultry. First, to choose a ten- 
der chicken, examine the tip end of the breastbone — the lower 
€nd of the breast bone, to see if it is soft; if it bends without 
breaking under pressure; in other words, if the cartilage has not 
hardened into bone, you may be sure that the chicken is young, 
and consequently probably tender. The market people have a 
favorite way of showing you that the chicken is tender by tak- 
ing hold of the wing and giving the joint a twist. They say, 
^' You see how tender it is !" But that is no test except of 
strength. But there is no ingenuity which can simulate that 
soft cartilage on the end of the breast bone. That is always a 
sure test. After choosing the chicken— of course now I am 
speaking of dressed chicken, or chickens that are killed — after 
choosing the chicken, have it carefully picked and singed; then, 
if it is undrawn, wipe it with a wet towel, and proceed to draw 
it carefully without breaking the intestines. If it is drawn al- 



UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA. 69 

ready the chances are that it will be imperfectly drawn and you 
will have to wash it. There is the disadvantage of having poul- 
try drawn before it goes to the market, because where peo- 
ple draw poultry in large quantities they are very apt to do 
it carelessly. In that case it is necessary to wash it, but if you 
■draw it carefully yourself you will not have to do that. By 
washing, you of course take away the flavor, as I told you the 
other day, because you lose more or less of the blood. 

Cut the skin of the back of the neck and take out the crop, then 
<}ut off the neck close to the body, that leaves the skin so that 
you can draw it up and fasten it back. If this chicken was not 
already cut for drawing I should cut it at one side under one o^ 
the legs, so that when I came to sew it up and dress it I could 
hide the cut. This chicken has been drawn carefully and does 
not seem to need washing. The liver and gizzard have been laid 
back inside. The entrails are all taken away. You can always 
-tell by looking at the chicken whether the entrails are broken 
and whether it needs washing. After you have drawn the chick- 
en very carefully separate the gall from the liver. The gall is 
that little greenish bag that lies on one side of the liver; and you 
want to cut it off without breaking, because if you break it it will 
make bitter everything that it touches. Save whatever fat there 
is about the entrails, and put it in the baking pan with the chick- 
en. The gizzard has been cut open from one side and the in- 
side bag which contains gravel and straw taken out. But a very 
much easier way to dress the gizzard instead of opening it, is to 
-cut away the bluish skin which lies on the outside, on both sides, 
without opening the gizzard at all, and cut out that piece of 
flesh. That is the only valuable portion of the gizzard; if you 
"dress the gizzard in this way when it is not already opened you 
«ave yourself a great deal of trouble, for it is a very hard matter 
to open a gizzard like that and take away the bag which con- 
tains the gravel, especially if the poultry has been frozen, as the 
bag is apt to break and let out the gravel. Use the gizzard and 
liver for making gravy, and the neck also. Cut out the oil sac 
or bag which lies at the back of the tail. Then the chicken is 
ready for stuffing. In cutting off the feet cut them below the 
joint, not just at the joint. If you cut them just at the joint the 
skin and flesh will draw up in cooking. But if you cut them 
just below the joint you will find that they do not draw up. 
After cutting off the feet scrape the skin all round to make sure 
that there are no bits of feather or anything of that sort, and 



60 BIENNIAL REPORT 

wipe it with a wet towel and you have the chicken in readiness 
to stuff. 

Stuff it with any force meat that you like. You remember this 
morning that we made force meat by chopping a teaspoonful of 
onion and frying it in a tablespoonful of butter, then putting in 
with the fried onion a cupful of stale bread soaked in cold water, 
seasoning with salt and pepper and sweet herbs. I said also 
that you could add chopped meat, cold meat or eggs, or to make 
any desired addition to the force meat in the way of seasoning. 
A little grated cheese in stuffing is very nice. You scarcely 
will realize what the seasoning is. I will use a little grated 
cheese this afternoon to make a force meat — very like what I 
made this morning, except in addition to the chopped onion 
fried in a tablespoonful of butter, seasoned with salt and pepper, 
I shall put in half a cupful of grated cheese. You may like ta 
know my way of choping onion. In the first place, I make a lot 
of little cuts in one direction as far down as I think I shall need 
in order to get my teaspoonful; then I make little cuts in the 
other direction, and then by sliciog it across you get your 
chopped onion. A very nice addition to force meat is chestnuts, 
either our ordinary American chestnut, or French or Italian 
chestnuts. These are quite large. I presume they are for sale 
at the fruit stores here. Our ordinary American chestnut is 
very good. Choose rather large chestnuts and either roast or 
boil them; take off the husks and skins and thus use them to 
stuff the chicken with, either simply using the chestnuts sea- 
soned with salt, pepper and butter, or if you have boiled or 
roasted and skinned them, mix them with bread and seasoning. 
Then, after having prepared the force meat, you put it into the 
chicken, sew it up and truss it into shape. I will show you di- 
rectly how to do that so as to keep the chicken plump, and so 
that it does not, in roasting, spread apart. I shall sew it with 
a trussing needle and a cord, or you might accomplish the same 
purpose, by using skewers, putting the skewers just where I put 
the cords. In sewing up a chicken after it is stuffed, remember 
what I said this morning; take large stitches with coarse cord so 
that you can easily see where to take the threads out when the 
chicken is done. After the chicken is trussed, if you are going 
to bake it, put it into a pan without any water, for the same rea- 
son that I gave you this morning. The water will soak it, half 
simmer it; you do not need water to keep it from burning, be- 
causea little drippings will soon come from the chicken; brown 



UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA. 61 

it and then dredge it with flour, and baste it every fifteen min- 
utes or so. Bake it until it is tender and nicely brown; the time 
of course depends upon the heat of the oven. Truss the chicken 
first, pushing the legs as far up as you can towards the breast,, 
and run the trussing needle, which is simply a long needle, 
through so as to hold the legs fast. Then either bend the wings 
back in turning them, or simply fold them together and secure 
them with the same string. By drawing the string tight, you 
keep the bird plump; keep it drawn together, and when the 
bird is done all you have to do is to take these two ends of string 
in one hand, make one cut and pull the string out. 

The liver, the gizzard, the heart, the neck and the feet, use in 
making gravy. Of course the gizzard, liver and heart are all 
right as they are now prepared. If you wish to add the feet, 
you will scald them and scrape off the skin. Then cut off the 
ends of the claws, and you have the feet perfectly clean; put 
them with the gizzard, liver and heart to boil as the basis of 
your gravy. The French people always save all the feet of all 
kinds of poultry. They prepare them in this way and put them 
into soups; sometimes they cook them till the bones grow gelat- 
inous, till they are very soft and tender; they dress them with 
sauce and serve them as what they call an entree or side dish. 
They make a dish which is more delicate than pigs' feet. Of 
course in a large kitchen where a great deal of poultry is used 
it is possible to make a very good-sized dish of them. 

FRICASSEED CHICKEN. 

I shall use this chicken for fricassee; it has been singed, 
picked and wiped with a wet towel. 

First, cut the skin down back of the neck, and cut off the 
neck. I shall talk about this chicken as if it was not drawn at 
all. Showing ^you how to cut it up and draw it at the same time. 
Cut off the neck and take out the crop, as I showed you with 
the other chicken. Then cut off the wings, taking a little of the 
breast with the wings. Find the joint where the wings join the 
body, cut at that joint; then, instead of cutting the wing right 
off short, take a little piece of the breast with it. That gives 
you a nice piece. Then cut the wing in two, and cut off the tip, 
which is dry; that you can cook in the fricassee, or not, as you 
please. It fl ivors, but there is very little meat on it. The other 
part of the wing you want, of course, to use. Put the pieces of 



62 BIENNIAL REPORT 

chicken on two plates, putting the good pieces on one plate and 
the inferior pieces on the other. Having taken off the wing, 
take off what is called the wing side bone. Then cut forward 
and break off the shoulder bone. The idea is to cut the breast 
into several good -sized pieces. Cutting in this way you sacrifice 
what is called the merry- thought or wishbone. You either can 
cut off the side bone or not. Cut off the other wing in the same 
way. Then cut off the leg and second joint together. Instead 
of cutting the leg in two pieces at both joints, cut it in three 
pieces, that gives you two pieces of the second joint. In cook- 
ing chicken for fricassee you want to have the pieces about one 
size, so that they will cook easily. Then if they are one size 
they are much easier to help. 

Next, to separate the breast from the back bone, cut down 
through the ribs on each side. If the chicken has not been 
drawn be careful with your knife, not to cut into the entrails. 
Then you can take the breast off, and if the chicken is not 
.drawn, all the entrails will be exposed, and you can draw it with 
perfect ease. The lungs of the chicken, which are those light 
red otgans on the side of the back bone, are always used by the 
French in cookery, not only those organs in chicken but in the 
larger carcasses of meat. They are quite as much food as the 
heart or liver. I am not in the habit of using them, but they 
are quite as available. After the breast has been taken off, cut 
it up in several pieces. First, cut off the entire tip, leaving 
that in one piece. Then cut the remainder in two or four pieces, 
according to its size. Next cut the back bone. There is a natur- 
al division in the upper part of the back bone that breaks there f 
cut that off and trim off the ribs. In cutting the lower part of 
the back bone, instead of cutting it just in two, making rather 
queer pieces to help, cut off the upper part of it leaving it en- 
tire, not splitting that part of it. In that way, cut off the por- 
tion called the " oysters,'^ — two little pieces of flesh in the upper 
part of the back bone, that are considered very nice. On one 
plate we have the inferior parts, on the other the nice parts of 
the chicken, being all cut in pieces of one size. It is easy to 
help, it cooks more evenly, and is rather nicer than if you had 
it in two or three sizes. Part of the chicken I am going to make 
into a brown fricassee, and part of it I am going to fry. There 
would be thirteen pieces if we counted the two pieces of the 
back bone. There are half a dozen of the poor pieces, not count- 
ing the wing pieces or neck. The question is asked whether 



UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA. 65 

the cords or sinews should be drawn from the legs. You can do 
that with old poultry if you want to, because those cords never 
get very tender. It is not necessary to do it with |niedium ten- 
der poultry. 

First brown the chicken, using either some of the chicken fat^ 
or butter, or salad oil for browning it. Now, since the question 
of using salad oil in cooking has come up, suppose I cook this^ 
chicken with salad oil so that you can taste it. After all, that 
is the best test you possibly can have as to whether you like 
salad oil in cooking. I shall put in just salivi oil enough to 
cover the bottom of the sauce pan. That is enough to prevent 
sticking. For a chicken of three pounds take about three or 
four tablespoonfuls of salad oil; just enough to cover the bottom 
of the sauce pan. First put the sauce pan containing the salad 
oil over the fire and let it get hot; then put in the chicken and 
brown it. Now, can you notice'the slightly aromatic odor? That 
is the oil, and directly you notice that odor, and the oil begins- 
to smoke, it is hot enough. As soon as the chicken is brown. — 
and you can brown it just as fast as you want to, — then put a 
heaping tablespoonful of flour over it — some of the iadies will 
have seen the same process in making the brown stew of meat 
the other day — and stir the chicken until the flour is brown. 
When the flour is brown on the chicken, — and that will be by 
the time you get it well stirred up, — then add boiling water 
enough to cover it. When the flour is brown among the 
chicken, put in boiling water enough to cover it, season it with 
pepper and salt, palatably, and let it cook until it is tender. 
That will take from half an hour to two hours, according ^to the 
toughness of the chicken. Remember the more slowly you cook 
it after it once begins to cook, the nicer it will be. Cover up 
the sauce pan after the fricassee is seasoned, and cook it until it 
is tender. In the cooking of chicken the gravy that you make 
by putting boiling water on seems to boil away, and you may 
want to add a little more; just keep enough gravy over it to 
cover it, and when it is tender it is ready to serve. The odor 
you notice now is the aromatic odor of that salad oil, and is all 
that you will get in cooking with olive oil. 

FRIED CHICKENS. 

Next the fried chicken, Mag'yland style, will be prepared. We 
will fry the chicken, and then I will tell you about hominy. 
The Southern cooks use lard for frying, either lard entirely or 



64 BIENNIAL REPORT 

half lard and half butter; enough to cover the bottom of the 
frying pan about half an inch. Let the fat get hot, put some 
flour on a plate, season it with salt and pepper, and roll the 
pieces of chicken in it. When the fat is hot in the pan and the 
chicken has been rolled in the flour, put it into the hot fat 
and fry it brown, first on one side and then on the other. Of 
course tender chicken is generally used for this dish so that by 
the time it is fried brown it is done. Fry the chicken until it is 
tender and brown. Take up the chicken when it is brown, put 
it on a hot dish; in the frying pan where it was fried, put enough 
cream to make a good gravy, stirring it constantly. You see 
there will be flour on the pan off the fried chicken that will 
thicken the gravy. Season the gravy with salt and pepper, 
pour it over the chicken and serve it. Some of the colored 
cooks whom I have seen prepare this dish first dip their chicken 
in water before rolling it in the butter and flour. That is for 
the purpose of making more flour stick to it; but there is always 
this disadvantage, if you do that there will be some particles of 
water remaining, and when you put it in the hot fat it will sput- 
ter very nruch. You can do that or not as you like. While the 
chicken is being browned I will tell you how to prepare the 
hominy. Of course the chicken is to be seasoned with more 
pepper and salt if you wish, in addition to what you put on in 
the flrst place with the flour. 

HOMINY. 

First pick the hominy over and wash it. Fine hominy is gen- 
erally used for this dish. Put it over the fire in cold water, a 
cupful of hominy to about four cupfuls of water. Boil it and 
stir it often enough to prevent sticking, until it begins to be 
tender. Boil it for an hour, until it begins to grow tender. Then 
place it where there is no danger of burning, pour ofl" the water, 
or leave off the cover of the sauce pan so that the water will evap- 
orate. The hominy will need to cook pretty nearly an hour, and 
when it is done or nearly done it should be as thick as hasty 
pudding. If you have a double boileryou can put in very much 
less water, for there is no danger of burning. I think you would 
need only about half or a little more than half as much water. 
Only take care to leave the cover off the kettle if you find that 
the hominy is going to be thinner tjian hasty pudding when it is 
nearly done. If the hominy is used rather coarse, about five 
minutes before it is done mix a tablespoonful of flour with just 



UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA. 65 

enough water or milk to make it a thin liquid, and stir it into 
the hominy. That will hold it together when it is cold, so that 
it can be cut into slices. In making hasty pudding you can put 
that tablespoonful of flour in to hold it together when it is cold. 
You want to allow long enough for the flour to boil thoroughly; 
before dishin g the hominy when it is tender pour it into an 
earthen dish or shallow tin pan wet with cold water, and let it get 
cold and hard. Always make this in advance of your fried chick- 
en. You want the hominy cold and solid so that you can cut it. Cut 
it in little cakes about an inch thick and two inches square. These 
little cakes of hominy are to be fried either in the pan with the 
chicken or in another pan by the side of the chicken, and served 
oa a dish with the chicken. 

FRIED FISH. 

*I have here some fish which I shall fry. We will not try 
broiled fish, because this has been frozen; we will do that some 
other day. In frying fish use either Indian meal or flour, sea- 
soned with salt and pepper, to roll the fish in. Fry the fish in 
lard or the drippings from salt pork. In case you use salt pork, 
fry it brown. Olive oil is one of the nicest fats for frying fish. 
You may have your choice whether I fry with lard or oil. We 
will fry in oil. If you use lard at all you want it to be very 
nice. In the frying pan I shall put about half an inch of oil; 
that is less than half a cupful. Put it over the fire and let it 
get hot, just as I did for the chicken. This is frozen fish that 
has been thawed. Cut the fish in pieces about two inches square 
and roll them either in flour seasoned with pepper and salt, or 
Indian meal, as I told you; put them into the oil when the oil is. 
hot. As soon as the fish is browned nicely it will be done. Youi 
can add more seasoning than there is in the flour. Use Indiaui 
meal with pork; it is particularly nice.

LECTUEE SEVENTH. 

Our lesson this morning, ladies, will begin with pea soup with 
crusts. This soup I shall make with the addition of a little 
onion. You remember the other day we made pea soup per- 
fectly plain. We shall cook salt codfish stewed in cream, veni- 
son with currant jelly, stewed carrots, and cabinet pudding. 
First the peas will be put on the fire to boil, and I shall begin 
to make the pudding. 

CABINET PUDDING. 

The cabinet pudding as I shall make it to-day will be rather 
elaborate. You can make it more plainly. It is made of cake, 
— sponge cake is the best, — French candied fruit, eggs and milk. 
So that, first, 'I shall give you the recipe for the pudding as I 
make it to-day, and then I will give you the recipe for the plainer 
form. For the pudding use a pudding mould of the size I have in 
my hand (holding about a quart), about half a pound of French 
candied fruit, which you can get at the confectionaries here; I 
have to-day candied cherries, a little candied pear, a green lime 
candied, a small orange, and an apricot. I shall also use a very 
little citron, about an ounce of citron. That I want simply for 
the effect of the green part of the citron. Put the citron in the 
form of small leaves. The large fruits cut in slices, which you 
may leave round or cut in the form of stars or to imitate a flower 
bud. After you have cut the fruit, butter a perfectly plain tin 
pudding mould thickly with cold butter, — quite thickly. Have 
the butter cold; lay the fruit against the mould in the form of a 
wreath, or a star, or any fanciful form you like, some on the 
bottom of the mould and some on the sides. The cold butter will 
hold the fruit in place. After part of the fruit is laid against 
the sides and bottom of the mould, then cut the sponge cake in 
large slices about half an inch thick, one slice the size and shape 
of the bottom of the mould, and either one long slice that will go 
round the sides of the mould inside-, or two or three pieces, ac- 
cording to the size of your cake. Generally, in cities where 
there are confectionaries, you can buy sponge cake baked in large 
thin sheets. You know the form in which it is used for the 
bakers' charlotte russe. This is baked in large sheets; cut it in 



UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA. 67 

small sheets and fit it into the moulds. Because it is very thin 
you can work with it very much better than you can with that 
which is thicker. This will be very apt to break, because it is 
very stiff. If you are to shape the cake to your mould the cake 
should be perfectly soft and flexible. 

After the first layer of cake is put against the mould, then use 
the rest of the cake cut in small pieces, or broken, and put into 
the mould in layers with the rest of the fruit. You see, first you 
use some of the fruit to ornament the inside of the mould, then 
some of the cake to line the inside of the mould. That gives you 
what will be the outside of your pudding when it is done. Then 
when the mould is decorated with fruit and lined with cake, put 
the rest of the cake and fruit into the mould in layers. Make a 
custard of a pint of milk and six eggs, because for this pudding 
the custard must be firm enough to hold the pudding in shape 
so that it can be turned out of the mould; also a quarter of a 
pound of sugar; that is about four heaping tablespoonfuls of 
sugar. 

After the custard is made, pour it into the mould which you 
have filled with cake and fruit, and let it stand so that all the 
custard may be absorbed by the cake. When the custard has 
been entirely absorbed by the cake, set the mould in the steamer 
or in the sauce pan with water to reach two thirds up the side 
of the mould. Put the cover on the steamer, or sauce pan, and 
steam it until the custard is firm. That will generally take 
about an hour and a half. It may take a little longer, but be 
quite sure that the custard is firm. Do not cook the custard 
first, just mix it up. In order to be sure that the custard is firm 
before you attempt to turn the pudding out, you want to run a 
fork or a small knife down through the thickest part in the mid- 
dle of the pudding; move it backward and forward; look into 
the pudding to make sure that the custard is done. As long as the 
custard looks liquid at all, you must keep on cooking. When the 
pudding is done take the mould out of the steamer, using a towel, 
because the mould will be hot. Take a dish or platter that fits 
just over the top of the mould; have the inside of the platter the 
size of the top of the mould; put the platter over the mould and 
• turn it upside down; then you will find that you can lift the 
mould from the pudding without any trouble, and the pudding 
will remain there on the platter. This pudding I shall serve 
with powdered sugar. It is exceedingly rich. It is not necessary 
to have a sauce with it because it is so rich. But you can use, if 



68 BIENNIAL REPORT 

you wish, any of the nice pudding sauces that I have told you of. 
This is a pudding which in Europe is served as the greatest lux- 
ury. It takes its name '* cabinet" pudding from the fact that it is 
served in the little rooms, or cabinets, that is, the private rooms 
where special dinners or suppers are given in the European restau- 
rants. What is called cabinet pudding in the restaurants and hotels 
in this country is usually a nice bread pudding made with fruit, and 
it is not decorated in this way. Trouble is not taken to decorate 
the mould. It is simply a nice bread pudding made with custard, 
with some raisins or currants in it. That is what is called cab- 
inet pudding in this country in the restaurants and hotels. So 
you can make the memorandum that you can use instead of the 
cake, bread; and instead of the French'fruit, simply raisins, cur- 
rants and cit];on. You can spend as much time and ingenuity 
decorating the pudding as you like, but I have done this very 
quickly and very simply. The pudding can be served hot, or it 
can be cooled and then put on the ice and made very cold. 
You noticed that in filling the mould I pressed the cake down 
on the inside, because, as it is saturated with the custard, of 
course it would sink down. You want to press the cake well 
down in the mould, and have a layer of cake on top, the last layer 
of cake. 

Question. If you made it of bread wouldn't you have to use 
more sugar in it? 

Miss Corson. Yes, if you use bread you would have to use 
more sugar. 

Question. Do you have any salt in it ? 

Miss Corson. You don't need to put any salt in it. You 
can if you want to. There is no necessity for it, because there 
will be salt both in your bread and in your cake. 

Question. Do you flavor the custard ? 

Miss Corson. No, just the plainest custard. You will find 
that the French fruit will give the custard all the flavor you re- 
quire. You will find that if you put the custard into a pitcher 
after it is made you can pour it into the pudding very much 
more readily than if you try to pour it from the bowl. Either 
put it into a pitcher or use a cup, because you will have to pour 
it slowly in order to let it thoroughly absorb. 

PEA SOUP WITH CRUSTS. 

Next take the recipe for pea soup. Some of the ladies who 
were at the Monday afternoon lesson will need only to make one 



UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA. 69 

or two notes, and the others will take the full recipe. For pea 
soup, four quarts, use a cupful of dried peas, yellow split peas. 
Pick them over, wash them in cold water, put them over the 
fire in two quarts of cold water and let them heat slowly. As 
the water heats it softens the peas. When it is boiling add half 
a cupful more of cold water and let that heat; then add more 
cold water; continue to add cold water, half a cupful at a time, 
until you have used two quarts more of cold water in addition 
to the first two quarts. The object of adding cold water slowly 
is to soften the peas, by reducing the heat of the water and then 
gradually increasing it again you soften the peas so that you can 
cook them in from an hour and a half to two hours. Boil them 
very slowly without the addition of salt until they are soft 
enough to rub through a sieve with a potatd masher. After 
they are rubbed through the sieve put them again into the soup 
kettle with a tablespoonful of butter and a tablespoonful of flour 
rubbed to a smooth paste. Stir the soup over the fire until the 
butter and flour are entirely dissolved; then season the soup 
palatably with salt and pepper and let it boil for two or three 
minutes. While it is boiling cut two slices of stale bread — 
bakers' bread is the best, or very light home-made bread — in 
little dice about half an inch square. Put a couple of table- 
spoonfuls of butter in a frying pan over the fire and let the but- 
ter begin to brown, then throw the dice of stale bread into the 
butter and stir the bread until it is brown. Take it out of the 
butter with a skimmer, if it has not absorbed all the butter, and 
lay it for a moment on brown paper, and then put it on a hot 
dish to send to the table with the soup. Do not put the bread 
into the soup unless you are going to serve at once, because it 
will soften a little; but you will find that fried bread will soften 
less quickly than toasted bread. A great many people put 
small squares of toast in the pea soup, but that softens at once, 
If you have a frying kettle which you use for doughnuts or frit- 
ters, or anything of that sort, partly full of frying fat, you can 
heat it and fry the bread in that instead of frying it with the 
butter in a frying pan. Have the fat smoking hot; the bread 
browns very quickly; take it out on a skimmer and lay it on a 
brown paper for a moment; then it is ready for the soup. These 
little fried crusts of bread are called croutons or crusts in the 
cookery books. I am going to add an onion fried in butter to 
the soup to day. Put that in, if you use it, when you first begin 
to cook the soup. One onion, peeled, sliced, and fried light 



70 BIENNIAL REPORT 

brown in a tablespoonful of butter. You could also use the 
bones from ham, cold roast ham, cold boiled ham, or the bones 
of beef either raw or cooked, in the place of the onion, or in ad- 
dition to the onion, as you like. Remember all those things 
give distinct flavors t^ the pea soup. If you put any kind of 
bones in, put them in with the peas at the beginning and boil 
them with the peas. 



Next take the recipe for salt codfish, stewed in cream. Firsts 
to freshen salt codfish; that, of course, is always the first thing 
you do with salt codfish, no matter how you finish. You can 
do that by soaking it over night in cold water; if it has 
any skin on it be sure to have the skin side up. If you put it 
in the water with the skin side down, the salt which soaks out 
of the fibre of the fish simply falls against the skin and stays 
there. The fish does not get any fresher. A great deal of cod- 
fish in these days is sent to the market without either skin or 
bone. Supposing we have the regulation dried codfish, we skin 
and bone it, then soak it over night in cold water, and 
next morning put it over the fire in more cold water, plenty of 
it, and put the kettle or pan containing the fish and the cold 
water on the back part of the stove, wh^re it will heat very 
gradually. Do not let it boil at all, but keep it at a scalding 
heat. Do not more than let it simmer. The effect of the boil- 
ing on any salted fibre, whether it is fish or meat, is simply to 
harden it. Keep it at a scalding heat until the fish is tender. 
Of course that will depend upon the dryness of the fish. It may 
take a half hour, it may take an hour. That is one way to 
freshen fish. Another way — the way I am doing now — is ac- 
complished more quickly by putting the fish over the fire in 
plenty of cold water, enough to cover it; set it on the stove 
where it will heat gradually. When the water is nearly hot on 
the fish pour it off and put more cold water on. Let that get 
scalding hot; do not let it boil at all; simply let it get scalding 
hot — that is, let the steam begin to rise from it. Change the 
water as often as it gets scalding hot, until the fish is tender. If 
you are careful to change the water often enough, that is, if you 
do not let it begin to boil, probably the fish will be tender in half 
an hour — from half to three-quarters of an hour. The time will 
depend upon the dryness of the fibre of the fish. Generally in 
about half an hour it will be tender. As soon as the fish is ten- 



UNIVEKSITY OF MINNESOTA. 71 

der drain it, and then it is ready to dress in any way you wish to 
use it. To-day I shall make a little cream sauce, and heat the 
fish in it. That will be codfish stewed in cream sauce. Boiled 
codfish you would serve with boiled potatoes, and the white sauce 
is made either with water or milk and hard-boiled eggs. That is 
the old ;New England salt fish dinner. Usually, with a salt cod- 
fish dinner there were boiled parsnips and sometimes boiled 
beets; and it is very nice if you like codfish. For codfish hash, 
the old-fashioned codfish hash, use simply boiled codfish torn 
apart, forked in little fine flakes or chopped in fine flakes; of 
course all the skin and bone is taken off, mixed with an equal 
quantity of boiled potatoes, either ihashed or chopped fine, pal- 
atably seasoned with pepper; of course the fish would be salt 
enough, usually; for a pint bowl full of fish and potatoes, use a 
tablespoonful of butter. The fish and potatoes are thoroughly 
mixed, then put into a frying pan, with just enough butter or 
drippings to keep it from burning. You may put, for the quan- 
tity I have given you, a heaping tablespoonful of butter in the 
frying pan, and let it melt; then put in the fish, and continue 
stirring it. Eemember there is some butter in the hash already, 
and that will melt with the heat and probably be enough; but 
if you need any more to prevent its burning, add a tablespoonful. 
Stir the hash until it is scalding hot; then push it to one side of 
the frying pan with the knife you are stirring it with, and form 
it into a little oval cake at one side of the frying pan. When the 
hash is thoroughly hot, the butter in it will begin to fry out of it, 
and there probably will be butter enough to prevent its burning. 
Let it stand in the little cake at the side of the pan until it is 
browned on the bottom. You want to watch it a little, and now 
and then run a knife under it and loosen it from the pan, to make 
sure that it is not burning. Then, when the bottom is browned, 
hold a plate in one hand and the frying pan in the other^ and 
turn the fish out in a little cake on the plate or dish. 

CODFISH CAKES. 

To make codfish cakes, first make the fish fine; after freshening it 
and taking off the skin and bone, chop it or tear it in fine flakes; 
mix it with an equal quantity of potato either mashed or chopped 
— mashed potato is rather better for codfish cakes because you 
can pack it a little more closely in the form of cakes. To a pint 
bowlfull of codfish hash add a tablespoonful of butter, a palatable 
seasoning of pepper and the yolk of one raw egg. That is, half 



72 [biennial eepoet. 

codfish, half potato, a tablespoon ful of butter and the yolk of one 
raw egg, and a palatable seasoning of pepper. Then dust your 
hands, with dry fl.our; take a tablespoonful of this mixture up in 
your hand and either form it in the shape of a round ball or flat 
cake, as you like. Have ready a frying kettle or deep frying 
pan with enough fat or drippings, or lard, in it to cover three or 
four of the codfish cakes or balls, when you drop them into it. 
So that if you use a frying pan you must have a deep frying pan. 
You may make in that case codfish cakes, not balls. If you have 
a frying kettle you can make little round balls. When the fat is 
smoking hot drop the codfish cakes or balls into it and fry them 
just a golden brown, light brown. Take them out of the fat with 
a skimmer and lay them on brown paper for a moment to free 
them from greese, then serve them hot. 

You will notice that I always tell you in frying everything to 
take it out of the fat and lay it for a moment on brown paper, 
because then you are sure to free it from greese. l^ot necessarily 
very coarse paper; just ordinary brown wrapping paper. I do 
not mean manilla paper, but the common brown wrapping paper 
that comes around groceries and meat, that tradesmen generally 
use. The paper must be porous so that the greese will be easily 
absorbed. That is the only point you have to remember. The 
usual way of frying codfish cakes is simply to put fat enough 
in the pan to keep them from sticking, and in that way they are 
not browned all over, that is, they are not browned on the sides. 
They are simply browned on the top and on the bottom, and the 
fat has, of course, generally soaked into them so that you get them 
thoroughly greasy unless you have fat enough to cover them and 
have the fat smoking hot when you put them in. In frying it is very 
easy to use the fat repeatedly, if you only remember one thing. 
The fat you fry fish in you want to keep always for fish; then you 
can fry anything else, meat, chicken, fritters or doughnuts, in 
the other fat. Generally keep two jars or crocks of fat, and take 
care only to let the fat get smoking hot in frying, and as soon 
as you have done frying set the kettle off" the stove so that the 
fat does not burn; let it cool a very little, then strain it through 
a cloth into an earthen bowl and let it get cold. Wash the fry- 
ing kettle out and clean it thoroughly, and then you can put the fat 
back in it, and it will be ready for the next time, if you use a 
porcelain-lined kettle; if you use a metal kettle for frying, tin 
or anything of that sort, do not put the fat in it till you are 
ready to use it again, because it might rust it a little. If you 



UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA. 73 

strain it through an ordinarily thick towel there will be no sedi- 
ment. If you strain it through a sieve there will be a little sediment 
that will settle to the bottom of the fat, and you can turn the cake 
of fat out of the bowl when it is cold and scrape that off. The 
best way is to strain through a cloth in the first place. If you 
are careful with the fat you can use it repeatedly, — use it a dozen 
times or more, until it really is nearly used up. But if you are 
careless and let it burn, of course you very soon get it so dark 
in color that it colors* anything directly you put it in, before it 
is cooked, and it has a burnt taste. But if you use it at the heat 
I tell you, just smoking hotr and do not let it burn, you can use 
it repeatedly. ' Sometimes you can lift it out in one solid cake 
when it is cold; sometimes you will have to break it and take it 
off in more than one piece. Oq the bottom of the cake you will 
find a little brownish sediment which you must scrape off. Then 
you have the fat clarified and ready for use. For ordinary frying 
purposes the straining through the towel will answer. An earthen 
bowl is the best for keeping the fat in the kitchen, very much 
better than metal of any kind. 

STEWED CARROTS. 

Kext take the recipe for stewed carrots. Carrots, peeled, as 
many as you wish to make a dishful; cut them in rather small 
slices, a quarter of an inch thick, put them over the fire in salted 
boiling water enough to cover them; boil them steadily until 
they are tender. That will be in perhaps half or three-quarters 
of an hour; if the carrots are young and fresh they will boil in 
half an hour; longer as the season advances and the carrots grow 
denser in their fibre. Late in the winter it may take an hour or 
even an hour and a half if they are very large and woody. Boil 
them until they are tender. Then drain them and throw them 
into plenty of cold water, and let them get thoroughly cold. 
While they are cooling make a sauce of water or of milk, as you 
like. If you have an ordinary vegetable dish full of carrots you 
want about a pint of sauce. In that case you will make the 
sauce as I have told you several times: a tablespoonful of butter, 
and a tablespoonful of flour for a pint of sauce; melt the butter 
and flour together over the fire, stirring them constantly until 
they bubble and are smoothly mixed; then begin to add half a 
cupful at a time the milk or water that you are going to use 
in making the sauce; stir each half cupful in smooth before you 
10 



74 BIENNIAL REPORT 

add any more water. If the milk or water is hot, of course the 
sauce will be cooked all the more quickly. Let the sauce boil 
for a minute, stirring all the time, then season with a level tea- 
spoonful of salt for a pint of sauce, a quarter of a saltspoonful of 
pepper, remembering what I have said about using white pepper. 
Drain the carrots from the cold water and put them into the sauce 
to heat. While they are heating — and that will only take three 
or four minutes — chop a tablespoonful of parsley fine, and stir 
it among the carrots; then serve them as soon as they are hot. 
You may make the addition of parsley or not, as you like, but it 
is very nice. In some seasons of the year you can not have the 
parsley. If you have not parsley, and have made the sauce of 
water, you will improve the dish very much if you stir the yolk 
of a raw egg into the sauce and carrots when you take them off 
the fire, just before you dish them. I will do that to-day. I 
will make a sauce of water and add the yolk of an egg. You 
had better put two or three tablespoons of sauce into a cup with 
the egg and mix it, and then pour that into the sauce and stir it 
well. In chopping parsley use just the leaves, not the stalks; 
put them in the chopping bowl and chop them fine. If you chop 
on a board steady the point of a knife with one hand and use an 
up-and-down motion with the other hand. Of course you can 
understand that using a long knife in chopping you can chop 
very much more quickly than you could in a chopping bowl, 
where you only get a circular cut. One of the ladies asks me 
the object of putting the carrots in cold water. They are put 
first in boiling salted water-to set their color. The action of the 
salt in the boiling water slightly hardens the surface so that the 
color does not boil out. Then if you take them at the point 
when they are tender you check the boiling at once by the cold 
water and secure the color entirely. Of course you will under- 
stand that by draining them and throwing them into cold water 
you check the heat at once. If you simply let them stand in the 
water and gradually soften and soak, letting the water keep 
warm, you would soak the color out. That follows with all 
boiled vegetables. Where we want to preserve the color this is 
the simplest and easiest way to do it. 

Question. Can the color of beets be preserved in the way you 
speak of? 

Miss Corson. No, beats have to be boiled differently from 
any other vegetable. If you break the skin of beats, or cut 
them in any way, the color escapes in the water. So that to 



UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA. 75 

.prepare the beets for boiling, wash them very carefully without 
breaking the skin. Do not cut off the roots or the tops of the 
beets close; leave some of the roots and three or four inches 
of the stalk. Do not trim them off close, because if you cut the 
roots or stalks close to the beet you make a cut whence the color 
can escape; wash them very carefully without breaking the skin. 
Put them over the fire in boiling water. You do not need to 
salt it, in fact, it is better not to salt it. Boil them until they 
gro\^ tender to the touch. If you puncture the beet with a fork 
or knife, to try it, you let the color out, but you can take one of 
the beets up on a skimmer and use a thick towel and hold it in 
your hand and squeeze it to see if it is growing soft. Do not 
break the skin, always remember that. When the beet is ten- 
der you will find that it will yield a little, between your fingers, 
and the length of time required for cooking them will be from 
half an hour to two hours and a half, perhaps even longer than 
that. Young, tender, juicy beets may be coolied in half an hour. 
The older they are, the later it is in the season, the harder the 
woody fibre will be, and the longer it will take to cook them. After 
they are cooked really tender, then throw them into a bowl of 
cold water and rub off the skin with a wet towel. Do not leave 
them soaking in cold water. 

VENISON WITH CURRANT JELLY. 

Take the recipe for venison now, ladies. Enough butter to 
cover the bottom of the pan about a quarter of an inch. Let it 
get smoking hot, then put in the veiftson. You must have the 
pan large enough to hold the venison. As soon as the venison 
is brown oh one side turn it and brown it on the other. Brown 
it very fast. As soon as the venison is browned put with it the 
currant jelly. For every pound of venison use two tablespoonfuls 
of currant jelly — not heaping spoonfuls; or you might put one 
heaping tablespoonful for every pound of venison. As soon as the 
venison is brown put the currant jelly in with it. Put the pan 
back where it will not be too hot, and finish cooking the venison 
until it is done to suit your taste. It will cook, if it is an inch 
thick, pretty well done in about twenty minutes. Season it with 
salt and pepper, and when it is done put it on the platter and 
pour the currant jelly and butter over it. The cooking of the 
jelly with the venison makes it a nice sauce or gravy. 

Question. Wouldn't this be a nice way to cook buffalo or any 
other kind of game? 

Miss Corson. Yes, it is a very good way.

MEATS AND VEGETABLES. 



We will begin to-day with so-called roast beef, it is really 
baked. This is what is called a shoulder cut of beef, and is just 
as the butcher has sent it home, that is, withoutany of thel^nes 
being taken out. This thin part Of the beef can be either roast- 
ed with the rest or cut off and used as a stew. It is not very 
available at the table. It almost always is tough, and there is a 
great deal of fat proportionately. The lean that is there is very 
apt to dry and harden in the baking. So that the best way to 
use the part is to cut it off and cook it separately. Have the 
beef cut large enoijgh to give a roast from the thickest part. 
The white line of cartilage will be sure to bother in carving, and 
the best way is to cut it out before you cook the meat. You can 
cut it out without any difficulty. You can also cut off the bone en- 
tirely. You will not find that doing this will make the meat 
waste if you bake it or roast it properly, and you can carve it 
more easily and more economically. Carving when the bone is 
in the meat you are sure to leave more meat on than you really 
want to, and it is quite a difficult matter to carve even slices 
when the bone is in the meat. It is a very easy matter to take 
the bone out, and then either use the bone for soup meat or put 
it in the pan with the meat and let it bake as the basis for gravy. 
You will notice both in cutting the cartilage and the bone, I do 
not take off any meat. I simply cut close, and take away the 
parts I wish to remove without wasting any of the meat. That 
leaves a solid piece of meat which offers no difficulty in carv- 
ing; you can either fasten it in shape by tying a string . around 
it or by running a few skewers through it. The better way is to 
tie it with a string, because the skewers will make holes and 
permit the juice to escape. You can either take off the thin, 
outside skin of the beef or wipe it as I have already said, with 
a wet towel. With good beef the skin is so exceedingly thin 
that it is not objectionable in carving or to the taste. With poor 
beef, the skin is decidedly leathery, and then it is advisable to 
take it off. 

Question. How many pounds were there in your piece altogeth- 
er, before you began to cut it % 



UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA. 77 

Miss Cohson. Oh, I fancy it weighed five or six pounds. Of 
course you use the number of pounds that your family requires. 
I am speaking of dividing the meat so as to cook it in the most 
economical manner. You would buy a sufficiently large piece 
in weight to give you the thick part — large enough for your 
family for the roast, and the other part you use for the stew sub- 
sequently. We made a beef stew one day, here, I think. Boast- 
ing is cooking meat before the direct blaze of the open fire. Bak- 
ing is cooking it in the oven. Nearly all the so-called roast beef 
that we get is baked beef. It :fe not quite so delicate as real roast 
beef. You can accomplish the roasting of beef with any range 
or kitchen stove that has a large grate, that is, a grate where you 
can have a clear surface of coals against the grate, by using what 
is called a Dutch oven. This is a tin box, with one side open 
and a little hook in the top of the box, from which you can hang 
the meat. Then in the bottom part of the tin case there is a pan 
that catches the drippings. After you have got the meat all 
ready, you put the Dutch oven in front of the grate, standing it 
so that the open side of the Dutch oven is directly in front of the 
grate of your stove or range. You will find that the bright tin 
of the oven will reflect heat enough to cook the meat nicely. 
There you get a genuine roast. You do not get an old-fashioned 
roast on a spit before the open fire, but you get a nice roast. 
Generally those little hooks are so arranged that the meat swings 
a little — swings and turns, and if the hooks are not so arranged, 
once in a while, say once in half an hour, you want to turn it. 

Now, suppose you have not that oven, but still have an open 
fire, you can roast. I have roasted a chicken before a grate fire 
in the sitting room. You can roast small birds of any kind in 
that way, by putting something on the mantel piece heavy 
enough to support the weight of the bird. Tie a string around 
the bird or around the piece of beef and let it hang down in 
front of the fire. Put a platter under it or a dripping pan, and 
put the blower up in front of it. You might be amused at the 
idea of doing that as an experiment. I have made coffee in an 
old tomato can as an experiment, to see whether it can be done, 
and it is just as nice as any you could possibly make in the finest 
French coffee pot. After all there are many expedients that 
you can resort to in cooking with good results. 

After the meat is browned on the outside, whether you are 
roasting or baking, season it. Get it browned first on the out- 
side very quickly, then season it with salt and pepper, and after 



78 BIENNIAL REPORT 

that moderate the heat of the oven, or draw the Dutch oven a 
little away from the fire, and finish cooking till the meat is done, 
allowing fifteen minutes to the pound if you want it medium 
rare, about twenty minutes to the pound if you want it very well 
done. If you are baking the meat put it in the hottest oven, 
without any seasoning at all, without any water in the pan. 
You will find that the meat will yield drippings enough for 
basting. Our chicken that we basted yesterday, — do you remem- 
ber .how nice and brown that was? Pretty well basted, wasn't 
if? That had nothing in the pan for basting except the drip- 
pings which flowed from the chicken itself. Put the meat in 
the hottest oven until it is browned, and then moderate the heat 
and cook the meat fifteen minutes to the pound. We might do 
what the French callbraise the end of the roast, if you like to 
see the effect of slow cooking. One difficulty that we labor un- 
der here is that we have to use a very intense heat, otherwise 
the flame of this vapor stove goes out. In order to braise suc- 
cessfully you want a very gentle and continuous heat, — such as 
you would get on the back part of a cooking stove, — just heat 
enough to keep the meat simmering. We will do as well as we 
can by keeping the sauce pan at one side of the fire, and then I 
will describe the braising process, so that you can do it perfectly 
at home. If we have any cabbage we will braise the meat with 
it. That makes a dish that is used very much in the north of 
Europe, in Poland and Sweden. I think I will give you the re- 
cipe, whether we have our cabbage or not. 

Use a large pot or sauce pan, large enough to allow you to lay 
the piece of meat on the bottom; or, you can use a thick, deep, 
iron pan. I remember, several days ago, seeing in the hard- 
ware stores pans about ten inches high, pans made of Eussia 
iron, oval. You can use that for quite a large piece of meat if 
you have not a sauce pan. You want a pan deep enough to 
allow the water to come just over the beef. Put water in the 
pan, enough to cover the beef, and let it get boiling hot. I will 
give you two methods of braising. When the water is boiling 
hot, put the beef in it; watch it carefully until it just begins to 
boil again. The moment it boils, push back the pot or pan in 
which it is far enough away from the hot part of the stove to keep 
the water only simmering, only bubbling, not boiling. Put in 
whatever seasoning you like. If you use spice, cloves for in- 
stance, or mace, use it whole. If you use simply salt and pep- 
per, of course use them in the powder. Keep the cover very 



UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA. 79 

tightly over the pot or sauce pan, and cook the meat in that 
slow, gentle way, for at least two hours. A piece weighing not 
more than four or five pounds you want to cook at least two 
hours, or until it is tender. Eemember to cook very, very slow- 
ly. That is a very simple and easy way of braising, which any 
one can accomplish. 

Now I am going to give you the French method of braising. 
Out part of the fat off the meat, about half the fat off the meat. 
Put the part that you cut off in the bottom of the pot. Lay the 
meat on the fat. That is the way we will cook our meat to-day, 
because I have decided to cook the cabbage in another way. 
After you have put the fat in the bottom of the sauce pan, lay 
the meat on it, with the fat part up, so that, you see, you have 
fat under and over the meat. On top or by the side of the meat 
put an onion of medium size, peeled and stuck with about a 
dozen cloves. Put parsley, if you have it, about a tablespoon- 
ful of leaves, or some stalks, or parsley root; but remember that 
the flavor of parsley root is very much stronger than the leaf, so 
that you will use proportionately less root. One bay leaf, a 
tablespoonful of carrot, sliced, about a tablespoonful of turnip, 
sliced, and a level teaspoonful of peppercorns — unground pep- 
per — or a small red pepper. Then boiling water enough just 
to cover the meat. Then put on the cover of the sauce pan, and 
put the meat where it will simmer very gently until it is quite 
tender. The French always braise in what is called a braising 
pan; that is, two oval pans made in such a way that one sets into 
the other, and goes about a third of the way down. They put 
the article that is to be braised in the bottom pan, and then in 
the top pan they put hot ashes, or coals of wood or charcoal, 
mixed with ashes; so that there is heat top and bottom; then 
they put their braising pan by the side of the fire or at the back 
of the stove, where it will have a gentle heat, and cook it for a 
very long time. They braise it four or five hours, and it makes 
the toughest meat tender. After you once bring the meat to the 
boiling point you must not boil it fast; if you boil it ftist you will 
make it very much tougher. After you get it to the boiling 
point keep it there, and cook it slowly, and long enough so that 
it will be sure to be tender. If you are sure the meat is tough 
in the beginning, put half a cupful of vinegar into the water 
with it. You won't notice the vinegar when you come to eat the 
meat, and it will help to make the meat tender. The French, of 
<30urse, use the ordinary wine;of the country,— a sour wine,— it 



80 BIENNIAL REPORT 

has the same effect; it is about as sour as vinegar, and has about 
the same effect. I think, indeed, that is the reason why the 
French use so much wine in cooking meat. They use a very acid 
wine always, and probably use it for the purpose of making the 
meat tender in many instances. Put in salt, but not too much, 
for the effect of salt, while the meat is boiling, would be to 
narden it. Just a little salt, and then in seasoning your gravy 
you can add more salt. After the meat is braised French fashion, 
it is taken out of the broth, and the broth is strained and then 
used as a broth or soup, or made into a gravy. 

To make the gravy, for each pint of gravy that you wish to 
make, use a tablespoonful of butter or beef drippings and a 
tablespoonful of flour. Stir the drippings and flour over the 
fire in a sauce pan until they are brown. Then begin to add the 
seasoned broth in which the meat was cooked, half a cupful at a 
time, stirring it until it is smooth each time, until it boils; then 
season it with salt and pepper, remembering that the broth is 
already seasoned, so that you have to taste it. That makes a 
very nice gravy or sauce. Of course, you have plenty of broth, 
so you can make as much of it as you like. 

Take now a recipe for cooking cabbage to serve with braised 
meat. For a cabbage of medium size, — that is, a cabbage about 
^ large as a breakfast plate, — first wash the cabbage thoroughly, 
cutting away any part of the stock that seems woody. Then cut 
the cabbage in rather thin slices. That is very easy. Lay it on 
the board and cut' it down through. You would need a large 
sauce pan to cook a cabbage as large as a breakfast plafce, because 
remember when it is cut up it takes up more space. Put in the 
bottom of the sauce pan a tablespoonful of butter or drippings. 
If you are braising your meat you can open the pot and dip some 
of the drippings out of it. A tablespoonful of butter or drip- 
pings, half a cupful of vinegar, a tablespoonful of cloves, a 
teaspoonful of peppercorns and a tablespoonful of brown 
sugar. Then put in the cabbage on top of these things. Put 
the cover on the sauce pan, set it over the fire where it will steam. 
Be very careful not to let it burn. Keep it on the back part of 
the fire where it will simmer. Keep it covered. Every fifteen 
minutes take off the cover, and with a large fork or spoon lift 
the cabbage from the bottom so that the top uncooked part goes 
down to the bottom. In about an hour the cabbage will be ten- 
der. You do not need to begin to cook that until within, say an 
hour and a quarter of the time the beef is likely to be done. To 



UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA. 81 

serve it, turn it on a dish, leaving the spice, cloves and pepper 
in with it, and lay the beef on it. Just moisten the cabbage 
with a little gravy or broth from the beef, and serve the rest of 
the gravy in a bowl; remember that the broth from the meat is 
salted, and that in moistening the cabbage it seasons it, or if 
you like very much salt you can put a little with the cabbage in 
cooking. 

;N'ow, to boil cabbage quickly, and without odor: After thor- 
oughly washing it take off the decayed leaves, cut it in rather 
small pieces, but do not use the stalk of the cabbage — avoid 
that. Put over the fire a sauce pan large enough to hold the 
cabbage twice over. Have plenty of space in your sauce pan or 
kettle, fill it half full of water, put plenty of salt in the water, — 
that is, a level tablespoonful of salt to about a quart of water. — let 
ttie water boil,- be sure that it is boiling fast. Then put in the 
cabbage; get it boiling again just as fast as you can, and con- 
tinue to boil it just as fast as you can until it is tender. That 
will be in from ten to twenty-five minutes, according to the age 
of the cabbage. Young cabbage, early in the season, will boil 
tender in ten minutes; or it may take 15, 20 or 25. It never 
takes over a half hour unless the cabbage is very old or dry. 
The cabbage is done the moment the stalk is tender. A great 
many people have the idea that they must boil the cabbage un- 
til the leaf is almost dissolved. It needs only to be boiled a^ 
tender as you boil the stalks of cauliflower, and you would try, of 
course, the thickest part, which would be near the stalk. Ee- 
member, in the first place you would cut out any tough, woody 
stalk, but the tender stalk you would leave in, and that is the 
part you would try. If you boil it fast it will not take over 
thirty or thirty-five minutes at the outside, probably not more 
than twenty. Just as soon as the cabbage is tender drain it and 
put with it whatever sauce or dressing you are going to serve 
with it. That sometimes is vinegar, butter, pepper, and salt. 
Sometimes a little milk, butter, pepper, and salt. In that case 
it is called cabbage stewed with cream. Sometimes you would 
simply serve it without any further seasoning, only remember 
that the moment it is tender, drain it and serve. As I told you 
the other day, the odor of the cabbage comes from letting it boil 
until after the substance of the cabbage is so soft that the oil 
begins to escape from it, the volatile oil. That makes a strong 
odor in the room. As soon as the cabbage is tender it is ready 
to eat, and should be taken from the fire.

TURNIPS. 



To bake turnips, peel the turnips, either white or yellow ones, 
cut them in rather small slices, a quarter of an inch thick; put 
them over the fire in salted boiling water enough to cover them, 
and boil them fast until they are tender. It may take ten or fif- 
teen minutes, possibly twenty minutes, according to the age of 
the turnips. Of course you will understand that if the turnips 
are old and corky they will not be as nice when they are done as 
if they are in good condition. But as soon as the turnips are 
tender, drain them, put them in an earthen pudding dish, make 
a little white sauce, either with milk or water, — for a pint, a 
tablespoonful of butter, tablespoonful of flour; stir over the fire; 
then milk added gradually and stirred smooth; seasoned with 
salt and pepper, — make enough of the white sauce just to moist- 
en the turnips; pour it over the turnips; dust over the top some 
cracker dust or bread crumbs, just enough to cover the top of the 
turnips; put a little salt and pepper over the crumbs, and a scant 
tablespoonful of butter over the top of the crumbs. Then put 
the dish into the hot oven, and just brown the crumbs on the top 
of the dish. Serve it as soon as the bread crumbs are brown. 
That is a very nice and easy dish. If you have cold boiled tur- 
nips, slice them, cover them with white sauce and bread crumbs, 
and cook them just in the same way. 

(At this point Miss Corson announced that the cabbags was 
done, after being in between nine and ten minutes, and no smell 
was perceptible in the room.) 

I am going to moisten the cabbage with cream sauce, — that 
is white sauce made with milk, — and heat it for a moment and 
then it will be done. 

I will now answer a question that has been asked about cook- 
ing corned beef. The same principle applies to the cooking of 
corned beef that applies to the cooking of salted fish. You re- 
member this morning in talking about codfish I said, if you boil 
the salted fibre hard and fast, you make it hard and toughen it. 
That holds good in relation to salted meat or corned meat. You 
want to boil it very gently. There is comparatively little juice 
left in corned beef, so that the action of cold water is not so dis- 
astrous to it as it would be to fresh meat. Sometimes the beef 
is so very salt that it is desirable to change the water upon it. 
Put it over the fire in cold water. Let it slowly reach the boil- 



UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA. 83 

ing j)oint, and then try and see if it is too salt. If the water it- 
self seems very salt, change it. Put fresh water in, let it grad- 
ually heat, and boil very gently always. As soon as the meat 
reaches the boiling point, push it to the back part of the stove and 
boil it very gently until it is tender. It usually takes about twenty 
minutes to a pound, but boil it very gently and slowly. Then 
it will be tender. If you boil it fast it will be hard and tough. 
If you put a whole dried red pepper in with the beef in boiling, 
you will find that it will improve the fl^avor very much. If you 
intend to use the beef cold, leave it in the water in which it is 
boiled; take the pot off the stove and let it cool in the water in 
which it was boiled. Those same directions apply to boiling 
smoked or salted tongue. 

The turnips were just fifteen minutes in boiling. 

Kice points about boiled dinners are asked for. I think I have 
given you the nicest point in cooking beef, so that you will be 
sure to get it tender, and to cook cabbage so that it is tender 
and does not smell. Cabbage always goes with a New England 
boiled dinner, potatoes, onions, parsnips and squash. I told you 
about cooking beets this morning. All the other vegetables you 
may cook in boiling water, and salt to suit the taste. The old- 
fashioned way was to boil all the vegetables in the pot with the 
beef, adding the vegetables in succession, so that each one was 
put in just long enough before the beef was done to have it done 
at the time the beef was done; each one except the squash. The 
squash is best peeled and cut in small pieces and steamed. If 
you boil it you want to put it in boiling salted water until it is 
tender, and then put it into a towel and squeeze it, so as to get 
out the water; then season it with butter, salt and pepper, and 
serve it. 

I made gravy yesterday; I think if I give you the recipe to- 
day it will answer. Pour the drippings out of the pan, all ex- 
cept about a tablespoon ful; put a tablespoonful of flower in with 
the brown drippings; set the pan over the fire; stir the drippings 
and flour together until they are quite brown; then begin to put 
in boiling water, a little at a time, not more than half a cupful, 
and stir until the gravy is smooth; then season it palatably with 
salt and pepper. Onions are very nice cooked precisely as I 
have cooked cabbage to-day; that is, cooked until they are ten- 
der, and dressed with the white sauce that I used in dressing the 
carrot. 

For pressed corn beef the nicest cut is the brisket. Have the 



84 BIENNIAL REPORT 

cut rather long and narrow, and not a short chunk or piece. 
Take a long piece of meat, a foot long, or more; have all the 
bones cut out and roll it up tight. Tie it compactly, in the same 
way that I tied this meat. Tie it so that you have it in a tight 
bundle. Then boil it according to the directions I have already 
given you. After it is done let it partly cool in the liquor; th«n 
take it out and lay it on the platter; lay another platter on top 
of it, and put a heavy weight on the platter, and press it with 
the string still on until it is cold; then cut off the string and 
you have it in nice shape. If you want to use part of it hot for 
dinner, and then have it cold, you would have to boil it, and 
when it is done cut off enough for your dinner; then press the 
rest of it between two platters. You could double it over, but you 
could not press it so very well in shape. Cut it in slices; put it 
into a tin mould or tin pan and boil down the broth in which you 
have cooked it until it begins to look thick. Or, you could dis- 
solve a little gelatine in the broth to thicken it, and pour it over 
the slices of corned beef in the mould. In that case you would 
depend upon the gelatine to thicken the broth, without boiling 
it down. 



LECTUEE NINTH. 



BEEE A LA MODE ROLLS. 



Our lesson this morning will begin with beef a la mode rolls. 
Use the round of the beef or the end of sirloin steak. I have 
here a piece of round of beef. Out the beef in pieces about two 
inches wide and five long; lay these stripy of meat on the cutting 
board and season them with salt and pepper. In the middle of 
each one put a little piece of salt pork about a quarter of an inch 
thick. Eoll the meat up in such a way that the pork is inclosed 
in the middle of the little roll. Tie the roll to keep it in shape. 
You can use instead of salt pork pieces of fat from the meat. 
After all the little rolls are tied up put a vef y small quantity of 
beef drippings or butter in the bottom of the sauce pan or kettle. 
Put the saucepan over the fire with the drippings or butter in it 
and let the fat get hot. As soon as it is hot put the little rolls 
of meat in it and let them brown. As soon as the little rolls of 
meat are brown sprinkle flour over them, a tablespoonful of dry 
flour to half a dozen little rolls of meat. Let the flour brown. 



UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA. 85 

As soon as the flour is brown pour in boiling water enough to 
cover the rolls; add salt. Then put the cover on the sauce pan 
and set the meat where it will cook very gently. Remember 
what I have told you about cooking meat slowly if you want it 
to be tender. When the meat is q^uite tender — and that will be 
in from half an hour to an hour and a hal^ — the time will 
depend, of course, upon the fibre of the meat, then take off 
the strings and serve the rolls in the gravy in which they 
have been cooking. You see the brown flour and water and 
butter will have make a nice gravy for the rolls. Now if the 
meat is very tough remember what I have told you about the 
action of the vinegar on the meat fibre. For a pound of meat 
add about two tablespoonfuls of vinegar, when you begin to 
stew the meat, and let it cook with the meat; that will make 
it tender. You can vary the dish by cooking with it vegetables 
of any kind that you like to use. Add potatoes when it is 
within half an hour of being done, turnips peeled, cut in small 
pieces; carrots peeled and sliced. 

CARAMEL CUSTARD. 

I will make a caramel custard next. For caramel custard use 
a plain tin mould, oval or square in shape, that will hold about 
three pints. Put a teaspoonful of sugar in the bottom of the mould 
and set the mould on the top of the stove where the sugar will 
brown. You may want to shake the mould a litcle to scatter the 
sugar evenly over the bottom. When the sugar is brown set the 
mould off the fire on the table where the burnt sugar will get 
cold; that forms what is called a caramel or coat of burnt sugar 
on the bottom of the mould. Make a custard by beating together 
six eggs, a quarter of a pound of sugar and a pint of milk. After 
the custard is made pour it into the mould and set the mould in a 
sauce pan with boiling water that will come half way up the sides 
of the mould, and steam the custard until it is firm. When the 
custard is firm you can turn it out of the mold and use it hot or 
leave it until it is quite cold and use it cold. I have used granu- 
lated sugar this time. You can make the same custard, prepar- 
ing it just exactly as for steaming, but bake it, if you like, only 
you would set the mould in the dripping pan with water in it, 
Iwiking it just until it is firm, in a moderate oven. You could 
make it in teacups; in that case you would burn the sugar in an 
iron spoon or in the frying pan and while it still is liquid put

just a little in the bottom of each cup, because you remember it 
hardens directly. Then bake the cups of custard in a pan of 
water. Use the custard in the cups either hot or cold. If the 
custard is to be used cold leave it in the mould; it will stand better 
than if it is turned out hot. But it is stiff enough to retain its 
form even when it is hot. And the sugar that is in the mould 
forms a little sauce around it on thedish. 

TOMATO SOUP. 

Kext take a recipe for tomato soup. A can of tomatoes; put 
them over the fire. In the summer use about two quarts of 
fresh tomatoes. You will find that about two quarts will be 
sufficient. After the fresh tomatoes are peeled and sliced (you 
will remember canned tomatoes are already peeled), put them 
over the fire and stew them gently for about half an hour, or 
until they are tender. If the canned tomatoes are entirely solid 
you may need to add a little liquid, but I find there is generally 
more liquid in the can than you need. When tlie tomatoes are 
tender enough to rub through a sieve, put them through the 
sieve with a potato masher. That gives you pulp, or puree, of 
tomatoes. And you will add to the tomatoes, after they have 
been passed through the sieve, half a salt spoon of baking soda, 
and then milk enough to thin them to the proper consistency of 
soup. Season with salt and pepper, and let them boil, and serve 
the soup. If you want a thick soup, add to the tomatoes a quart 
of milk, and thicken the soup with cracker dust, very finely 
powdered and sifted. Thicken as much as you like, beginning 
with two heaping tablespoonfuls; add more if you want it. Of 
course you can j^ut butter in either of these soups, but it is not 
necessary. The way I shall make the soup to-day will be to 
thicken it with butter and flour after the tomatoes have been 
passed through the sieve. Do not confnse these two recipes. 
You have got one of thin soup; you have got another with milk, 
salt and pepper, thickened with cracker dust. Now a third: 
Put a tablespoonful of butter and a tablespoonful of flour in a 
saucepan. Stir them over the fire until they are melted together, 
then put in a pint of water gradually — a pint of hot water — 
stirring it smooth; and the tomato pulj). If that does not make 
the soup as thin as you desire — and it should be about the coj^ 
sistency of good cream — add a little more boiling water. ' Sea- 
son with salt and pepper, and stir it until it boils, and then it is 
ready to use. 



UNIVEBSITY OF MINNESOTA. 87 

^ext take directions for boiling vegetables, so that the color 
is perfectly kept. T told you yesterday that we should have 
spinach if we could get it, if not, that we would use lettuce. I 
think that next week, in the course of the lessons, I shall succeed 
in having some spinach from Cleveland. However, I shall use 
lettuce to-day. First, thoroughly wash it in salted water. For 
a quart of water use a tablespoon ful of salt. As I told you the 
other day, the salt in the water is for the purpose of killing any 
little insects that are in the leaves, especially of the lettuce. You 
know that it is very troublesome to dislodge them, bnt the salt 
kills them, and of course you can wash them out. As long as 
they are alive they cling there. If you sprinkle salt on the 
leaves it will wither them, but if you put it in the water it will 
not. Salted water is intensely|cold, you know, and it would restore 
the freshness of the leaves of lettuce, even if they were wilted, 
unless they were really on the verge of decay. If you will 
remind me, after I have fiuished giving the recipe for cooking 
the vegetables, I will tell you how to keep lettuce fresh. After 
your vegetables, whatever they may be, whether lettuce, or 
spinach, or asparagus, or string beans, are washed perfectly 
clean — I do not say wash peas, and I will tell you after a little 
the reason why ^- after they are thoroughly washed put them over 
the fire in enough boiling salted water to more than cover them 
— plenty of water, so that they can float about — the water to be 
salted with a tablespoonful of salt in a quart of water, and to be 
actually boiling when you put in the vegetables. This same rule 
applies to the cooking of peas, only that the peas are treated a 
little differently in the cleaning, but they are cooked in the same 
way. Boil the vegetable (whatever it is) in salted water, fast, 
just till they are tender. Eemember what I said about boiling 
carrots yesterday. As soon as the vegetables are tender, drain 
them and throw them into plenty of cold water. Leave them in 
the cold water until you want to use them. Then, if peas or 
beans, drain them, heat them quickly, with a little salt and 
pepper and butter, very quickly, or any sauce or gravy you wish 
to serve them in, and serve them hot. If lettuce or spinach, to 
make 3, puree, after having boiled in boiling salted water and 
then put in cold water, rub them through a sieve with a potato 
masher. After they are rubbed through the sieve they are ready 
to be used in different ways. In Europe the puree of lettuce is 
served as a vegetable, just as the j)ziree of spinach is. We do 
not often cook it in that way, but it is very nice; it is such an 



88 BIENNIAL PEPORT 

exceedingly tender vegetable that it takes proportionately more 
than of spinach. After the lettuce or spinach is rubbed through 
the colander or sieve with a potato masher it is ready to be sea- 
soned with salt, pepper and vinegar, or any sauce you like, and 
used as a vegetable, or used in soup. You remember what I 
told you about spinach soup yesterday ^ — puree of spinach with 
cream soup, colored green with spinach. Put in just enough 
spinach to cover it. If I succeed in getting spinach next week I 
shall make, at one of the lessons, spinach soup, and also boil and 
serve some as a vegetable. 

^ow about peas. I spoke about washing string beans but not 
washing peas. If the shells of the peas are at all dirty, and 
sometimes they are so that they blacken your fingers in shelling, 
wash the shells of the peas before you begin to shell them, but 
do not wash the peas after they are shelled. Of course the in- 
side of the pod is perfectly clean, and if your hands are clean 
and the shells are clean, you do not need to wash them. In 
using green peas in summer time it is well to have a quantity of 
them, perhaps twice as many as you are likely to use for one 
meal, and shell them, because you know they are of different 
sizes always. Shell them and separate them into two different 
sizes, the smallest and the largest, and then cook one size for one 
day, putting the others in a very cool place, or refrigerator, and 
cook them the next day, because if you have the large and small 
ones mixed they do not cook evenly. You will find them very 
much nicerj if you keep them in a cool place it will not hurt 
to keep them. 

The length of time that it takes to boil lettuce or spinach 
depends somewhat on the time of the year. The tenderer the 
spinach is, of course, the quicker it will boil; when it is very 
young and tender it will boil in two or thre minutes; when it is 
older it may take as long as ten minutes. ♦ Ladies very often 
make the mistake in boiling spinach that they do in boiling 
cabbage. They boil it sometimes until the leaves are destroyed, 
in order to soften the stalk. The better way is to tear away the 
stalk and use only the leaf. Of course, that gives you a smaller 
quantity of spinach than if you use the stalk, but when you use 
the tough, woody stalk you waste the leaf in boiling. Lettuce 
usually boils in a couple of minutes. One of the ladies speaks 
about cooking spinach without any water. You can do that if 
you wish. Just put in a sauce pan, after having carefully j)icked 
it over and washed it; stir it a little once in a while to be sure 



UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA. 89 

that the uncooked top goes down to the bottom. There is no 
special advantage in it, because if you boil it as I tell you, only 
until it is tender, the water has no effect upon it except to cook 
it more quickly. It is the English way to cook it without water. 
If you use boiling salted water, as I told you, it can not possibly 
affect the nutriment of the vegetable. It is when you boil vege- 
tables a long time, and boil them away before you take up the 
dish, that you waste the nutriment. These rules apply to every 
vegetable that has color in it except beets. Beets have to be 
cooked without cutting the skin or trimming them in any way, 
in order to keep the color. 

Now to keep lettuce fresh. I have kept it fresh, even in the 
summer time, for two or three days in this way: When it first 
comes in from the market wash it thoroughly in plenty of cold 
salted water. You do not need to tear it apart. You know I 
told you the other day about separating the leaves slightly from 
the head of the lettuce and shaking it in cold salted water. 
Trim off the outside wilted leaves. Wash it thoroughly in cold 
salted water, then wet a towel and lay the lettuce in it, fold 
it loosely up over the roots and if you have ice lay the towel on 
the cake of ice in the refrigerator or by the side of the cake of 
ice. If you haven't any ice and have a cold cellar, after you have 
washed the lettuce and wrapped it in the wet towel, put it in a 
box; a tight wooden box is the best, or a thick pasteboard box 
if it is not broken; and put it in the cellar in the coldest place 
you can find. If you wrap it in a wet towel and put it on the ice 
you do not want to look at it. It will keep fresh at least two 
days, and sometimes longer; but if you put it in the cellar you 
will have to wet the towel thoroughly twice a day, morning and 
night; and you will find that you will have to take away some of 
thfe leaves that have wilted, but if you have it upon the ice the 
chances are that you will not lose any leaves. And it is very 
much nicer than it is to let it wilt and then try to restore it by 
soaking it in water. 

FRIED PICKEREL. 

Next take a recipe for fried pickerel. Some of the ladies will 
remember that a few days ago we were talking about frying fish 
in this way with salt pork. If any of the ladies have the recipe, 
of course they do not need to take it again. For fried fish of any 
kind, enough salt pork to cover thebottomof the frying pan that 
you are going to use for the fish. You find you have three or four 
12 



90 BIENNIAL REPORT 

pounds offish; you will need at least half a pound of salt pork. Out 
the pork in very thin slices^ fat salt pork is the best. Put it in the 
frying pan and fry it until it is light brown. While the pork is 
being fried get ready the fish, having it thoroughly cleaned by 
washing it in cold water. If the fish is small you do not need 
to cut it; if it is large, cut it in pieces about three or four inches 
square. After the fish has been cleaned dry it in a towel; sea- 
son some Indian meal with salt and pepper, roll the fish in the 
Indian meal. When the pork is brown take it out of the fat and 
put the fish into the drippings and fry the fish brown, first on 
one side and then on the other. When the fish is browned 
nicely serve it in a dish with the pork — fried pork and fish in 
one dish. This fish will not get very brown to-day, because it is 
still frozen. It did not come in long enough ago for us to get it 
thawed out, so, of course, there will be a little water in the fat, 
and it will not get quite so brown. 



LECTUEE TENTH. 

CHEAP DISHES AND REWARMED FOODS. 

We begin our lesson this afternoon with a dish of rice, — piloff 
of rice, — any cold meat cut in small squares, an onion peeled 
and chopped fine, and if you have tomatoes, either canned, fresh, 
or cold stewed tomatoes, a cupful. Sometimes the dish is made 
with tomatoes, soi^ietimes without. Pat the onion in the sauce 
pan with a tablespoonful of drippings; set it over the fire and 
let it get light brown. When it is light brown put with it a 
cupful of rice, picked over and washed and dried by the fire. 
After the onion begins to brown put the rice with it and stir 
until the rice is light brown; then put in a quart of hot water, 
the meat and tomatoes and a i^alatable seasoning of salt and 
pepper. Of course, the quantity of salt and pepper that you 
use will depend on the seasoning of the meat, and this may be 
any kind of meat. Then cover the sauce pan in which you 
have all these things and let the rice, meat, tomatoes and water all 
cook together gently. Every ten minutes you must look to see 
whether the rice has absorbed all the water. If it has you must 
add a little more water, not more than half a cupful at a time, 
keeping the rice just moist until it is tender. You will find 
that probably in about half an hour the rice will be tender, and 



UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA. 91 

when the dish is done it should not have the gravy about it; it 
simply needs to be moist, so you will have to add w^ater 
cautiously after the first quart. 

If the meat that you use is very fat, — and sometimes beef like 
this is very fat, — you may cook the meat, fat and lean together 
in with the onion in the first place instead of the tablespoonful 
of butter or drippings. If you have no meat you can make the 
dish in the same way using tomato, onion and rice; and if you 
have cold gravy of any kind put that in it. 

FRENCH HASH. 

I^ext take the recipe for a dish called French hash. There 
is no potato in it, it is simply meat and gravy, so that you 
must* not let the name mislead you. Little slices of cold meat, 
fat and lean together. For a pint bowl ful of meat use about a table- 
spoonful of chopped onion. First slightly brown the onion with 
a tablespoonful of butter or drippings or fat from the meat; then 
when the onion begins to brown put in the meat and let that 
brown. -]^ext a tablespoonful of dried flour; stir the flour with 
the brown meat and onion until the flour is quite brown; then 
cover the meat with pork gravy or boiling water. After you 
have covered the meat with water or cold gravy just let the 
water or gravy boil, then season it palatably with salt and pepper; 
of course, the seasoning will depend upon whether you have u^ed 
gravy or broth or water. If you have used gravy or broth that 
already will liave been seasoned, so that you want to taste for 
the seasoning. After the gravy is both boiled and seasoned 
take the sauce pan off the fire and stir in the yolk of one raw 
egg with it and dish at once. You must not put the hash back 
on the fire after putting the egg in. If you do you will curdle 
it. Do not stir the egg in till you are ready to serve it, on 
toast or plain. 

BAKED TENDERLOINS. 

The next recipe will be for baked tenderloins. Split the pork 
tenderloins in such a way as to make rather thick slices. Ten- 
derloins are so thick that by cutting you spread them out. In- 
side the slice of tenderloin put any stuffing that you like. I have 
given two or three recipes for different kinds of stuffing. For 
this to-day I shall use a little stale bread, crumbed, seasoned 
with salt and pepper, and moistened with butter; a tablesj)Oon- 



92 BIENNIAL REPORT 

ful of butter to a scant cupful of bread, or in place of butter you 
could use an egg. After you put a little stuf&ngin the tenderlonis 
fold tliem together and either tie or sew them so as to keep the 
stuffing inside. Put the tenderloins in the dripping pan in the oven 
and bake them until they are thoroughly browned. Then take 
off the strings and serve them. They are very nice if you bake 
potatoes in the pan with them. If the oven is hot the potatoes 
and tenderloins will bake in about the same time. The potatoes 
should be peeled. Remember what I told you about always tak- 
ing large stitches in sewing up meat, so that you can see to pull 
them out when the meat is done. Of course, pork tenderloins 
will be pretty sure to yield drippings enough to baste with. I 
have spoken about that in the baking of meats two or three 
times. No water is needed in preparing them. The tenderloins, 
when sewed up, will resume their origiaal shape. 

FRIED LIVER. 

First, wash the liver in cold water, then pour scalding water 
on it and let it stand for about ten minutes to draw out the 
blood; slice it about half an inch thick. After the liver is 
scalded and sliced, roll it in flour, season it with salt and pep- 
per and put it into the frying pan containing about a quarter of 
an inch of hot fat, which may be drippings or fat from bacon or 
salt pork. In that case you first would fry the salt pork or 
bacon to get the fat or drippings, and put the slices of pork or 
bacon to keep warm when they are done. After the pork or 
bacon is fried put it on a dish to keep warm, and then fry the 
liver in the drippings. As soon as the liver is browned on both 
sides serve it on a dish with the fried pork or bacon. Fried liver 
needs to be cooked as quickly as possible, making sure that it is 
done. The more quickly you can cook it the tenderer it will 
always be. You can take that as a rule in regard to liver, heart 
and tongue, that the fatter they can be cooked the tenderer they 
will be. To-day I simply have fried this with drippings. I 
have not fried the bacon with it, but I have told you how to 
fry it. 

BAKED HASH. 

ISText take a recipe for baked hash. Equal quantities of 
chopped meat and stale bread, meat of any kind. Suppose 
you have a pint bowl of each. Mix with the meat and the 



UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA. 93 

bread a heaping tablespoonful of butter, a palatable seasoning 
of salt and pepper, and that, of course, will depend upon the 
seasoning of the meat. Yoii may use corned beef or highly 
seasoned meat, and then you will not need so much sea- 
soning as you would if you used fresh meat. A heaping 
teaspoonful of chopped parsley, enough cold gravy, if you have 
it, or broth to moisten the hash, — just to moisten it, not 
make it sloppy, — or if you have not gravy or broth you must 
use water and butter. Mix the hash very thoroughly. Have 
ready an earthen dish, buttered. See that the oven is hot, then 
very quickly dissolve a teaspoonful of baking powder in a tea- 
spoonful of water or broth and stir it into the hash just as fast 
as you can and put it into the oven to bake. As soon as the 
hash is brown on top it will be done. 

CORNED BEEF HASH. 

Now I will give you a recipe for corned beef hash. Yesterday 
we spoke about boiling corned beef. You will take cold corned 
beef and boiled potatoes, either hot or cold, about equal quan- 
tities. Sometimes people like a little more potato than meat. 
Mix the meat and potato together; add just enough water or 
broth to moisten the meat and potato. Season palatably with 
salt and pepper and butter; have the hash nicely mixed together; 
put into the frying pan; suppose you have a quart of hash, about 
two tablespoonfuls of butter and let it get hot, then put in the 
hash. Stir the hash in the butter until it is nearly hot. Then, 
using a knife, form it into a cake on one side of the frying pan 
and let the bottom brown. Loosen the hash once in a while 
from the bottom of the pan to make sure it is not burning and 
when it is brown on the bottom turn it out on a dish with the 
brown side up'. Another form of hash is the moist hash. That 
is simply prepared and warmed without browning it, using 
broth or butter and hot water for moistening it. 



94 BteNNIAL REPORT 

LECTURE ELEVEIS^TH. 

OYSTERS. 

We begin our lecture this morning with roast oysters, Mobile 
style. All oysters, when cooked, in any way, should be first put 
in a colander and the juice allowed to drain off, then strain the 
juice. Always take each oyster in the hand and carefully re- 
move all fragments of shell from the gills. The shells of oysters 
are dangerous to swallow, and serious illness is often the result. 
Hold the oyster by the hard part, removing pieces of shell with 
the finger. Then wipe the oyster with a wet towl. Keep the 
most perfect specimens for broiling, as the more imperfect ones 
will do sufficiently well for soups or stews. For roasting oysters 
in the Mobile style, have as many deep oyster shells as you in- 
tend to have oysters, scrubbed very clean; put the shells in a 
dripping pan and place them in the oven, until they become so 
hot as to melt butter when j)ut into them. When quite hot take 
the shells out of the oven and put a small piece of butter and a 
very little pepper in each shell. If the oysters are large lay one 
In each shell, if they are small put two or three in each shell and 
put them back in the oven directly. By the time the edges of 
the oysters curl they will be done. Oysters when heated through 
are done. Do not put any salt on them. Serve them on the 
shells. As they are served in Mobile, a large shell is used, laid 
on a small charcoal furnace, putting the shell on top of the fur- 
nace to get very hot; the furnace is brought to the table and the 
oysters opened and dropped into the hot shell and turned once. 
The regulation way of roasting oysters is to thoroughly wash 
the outside of the shell and lay them on the fire with the large 
end down. As soon as the oysters open serve them. 

To use the liquor, take a pint of the oyster liquor after it has 
been strained; sift a heaping cupful of flour; mix with it a level 
teaspoonful of salt and a heaping teaspoonful of baking powder. 
Have the griddle as hot as you would for pancakes. Very 
quickly stir into the flour enough of the oyster liquor to make a 
batter, and fry just as any pancake; serve hot with butter. 

Next take a recipe for oyster fritters. Have the frying ket- 
tle half full of fat, as you would for doughnuts. Strain the 
oysters and remove all bits of shell. In the meantime the lard 



UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA. 95 

should be heating on the back of the stove. Cut the oysters 
slightly. For a pint of oysters use a pint of flour, sifted, and 
mixed with a level teaspoonful of salt. Put the flour in a mix- 
ing bowl with the yolk of one egg, a tablespoonful of salad oil, 
and a pinch of peper. Use enough of the oyster liquor to make 
a batter thick enough to drop from the spoon. Beat the white 
of an egg to a stiff froth. Mix the oysters and the white of egg 
lightly with the batter, and as soon as it is mixed drop by the 
large spoonful into the hot lard. As soon as brown take 
the fritters out and lay them for a moment on brown paper to 
drain the grease off. In order to keep them hot while you are 
frying the rest lay the paper on a dripping pan and set it in the 
oven. 

Take next a recipe for oyster soup, thickened with cracker 
dust. For a quart of oysters, remove all bits of shell, as usual, 
and mix the oyster liquor with enough to make a quart. Take 
one tablespoonful of butter, a very little white pepper, if you 
have it, two tablespoonfuls of cracker dust finely powdered, As 
I told you the other day, the cracker dust which you buy at the 
cracker factories is the nicest. Stir all together over the fire, 
and when it comes to a boil put in the oysters, with a level tea- 
spoonful of salt. Stir till the edges of the oysters curl; then 
serve. To thicken with flour, stir one tablespoonful of flour and 
one of butter together over the fire. Season with pepper, and 
put in one quart of liquor and milk. 

For plain broiled oysters, prepare uie oysters as above direct- 
ed and lay them on a towel. Take a double- wire broiler and 
butter it thickly, taking care to have the fire hot. Season the 
oysters lightly with pepper and but very little, if any, salt. Put 
the oysters between the broiler, and broil them; serve them on 
toast. 

For breaded oysters, prepare as before, and dip the oysters in 
melted butter seasoned with pepper and salt, and roll them in 
cracker crumbs. Put them on the gridiron and broil them until 
they are light brown. 

For oysters broiled with bacon, cut very thin slices of t^^'^^^^" 
fast bacon, as many slices as oysters, and stick them on little 
skewers, half a dozen oysters on each skewer, first a slice of 
bacon and then an oyster, until you have half a dozen on each 
skewer. Flatten them so that they will lie a little apart. Put 
the skewer between the buttered bars of the gridiron, dust 
them a little with pepper and brown them. The bacon should 



96 BIENNIAL REPORT 

be cut very thin and about the size of the oyster. Serve them 
on the skewers. 

For oysters in the Philadelphia style, prepare the oysters by 
draining the juice from them and removing the small pieces of 
shells. Use for one dozen large oysters one tablespoonful of lard, 
two tablespoonfuls of salad oil. As soon as the fat is hot put 
the oysters in and fry them till the edges curl. Season them with 
pepper and salt. Fry them plain or rolled in flour. 

WELSH BAREBIT. 

For a rarebit large enough for three or four persons, put in a 
sauce pan a quarter of a pound of grated cheese, two table- 
spoonfuls of butter, a saltspoonful of salt, two tablesi^oonfuls of 
ale, one teaspoonful of mustard, a little dust of c lyenne pepper, 
stir all these together over the fire and serve on toast. 



LECTUEE TWELFTH. 



Cookery for the Sick. 

BROILED CHICKEN. 

For broiled chicken choose always a tender chicken. Re- 
move all the feathers, singe it over the fire, and wipe the 
chicken with a wet towel. Split the chicken down the back. 
In doing that one can remove the entrails without breaking. 
Take out the entrails and crop; lay the chicken open on 
the gridiron. It is better to use a double gridiron, well buttered. 
If the chicken is not tender, break the joints so the chicken will 
lie flat on the gridiron. Put the inside of the chicken to the 
fire first and brown it. Do not put it too close to the fire. Broil 
it fifteen or twenty minutes, for it will require about that time 
fo get well done. When the inside is brown, turn it and broil 
the oiitside, allowing about ten minutes. Take time enough to 
brown it nicely without burning. If you have a very young 
spring chicken less time will be required. Do not broil a chicken 
that weighs over three pounds. If the chicken is very large it 
is better to put it in a very hot oven in a pan, with no butter 
unless the chicken is very lean. Season with salt, pepper and 
butter, if desired, when it is removed from the oven. 



UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA. 97 

BARBECUED CHICKEN. 

Split down the back, and after breaking the joints dress and 
lay it open. Use two tablespoonfuls of butter and one cup of 
water. Season with salt and pepper. Brown the chicken well,, 
dredge it withflour and baste it every fifteen minutes with drip- 
pings from the pan until tender. Pour over it the gravy that 
you find in the pan, and serve. The Souther^iers, with whom 
this dish is a grtat favorite, usually put in this gravy some nice> 
table sauce. 

JELLIED OATMEAL. 

Take one-half cup of very finely ground oatmeal and put it 
over the fire with a pint of boiling water and a level teaspoon- 
ful of salt. Boil it very slowly until it becomes transparent.. 
This will require two hours or longer. Do not add any more 
water unless it is positively necessary. When it is done it 
should be stiff and hold its form when it is turned out. It 
makes a dish which is very nice and nutritious for sick people, 
when it is quite gelatinous. Add sugar, if it is desired, and put 
it in a mould. Serve when cold and solid with cream and 
powdered sugar. 

BOILED TROUT. 

Boiled trout makes an excellent dish for convalescents and it 
is very nutritious. Have the fish cleaned and the scales re- 
moved. The entrails should be drawn from the gills. After 
the fish has been thoroughly washed boil it in salted boiling 
water till you can easily pull a fin out, then serve it with a white 
sauce either made plain or with milk. French canned green 
peas are nice with trout. If the peas are served with the trout 
put the peas on the dish and lay the trout on them. 

Clam soup may be given to invalids with beef tea, alternating. 
Clam soup may be given when beef tea can not be digested. 
It is very nutritious. Drain off the juice and remove all bits of 
shell as with oysters. If the clams are whole put the shells 
over the fire until they are heated; remove the clams and 
simply season the juice very lightly with salt and pepper and 
use the broth in that shape. If you are using canned clams heat 
the clams in the juice, then remove the juice and season slightly, 
using the juice. Strain the juice. Take the clams and cut away 
13 



98 BIENNIAL REPORT 

the hard part from the soft part. Boil the juice, with the hard 
part, loDg enough to extract the flavor. Use the juice to make 
the soup, adding water or milk. When the soup is made season 
it, putting the soft part of the clam in it. Boil it a couple of 
minutes and serve it. Use butter and flour in the same manner 
as for thickening oyster soup. 

Make orange salad to serve with broiled chicken in the fol- 
lowing manner: For a small chicken use two small sour oranges, 
sliced very thin. Arrange them nicely on a dish. Place over 
the slices of orange a very little salt, a little cayenne pepper, and 
three tablespoonfuls of salad oil. If the oranges are sweet a few 
drops of vinegar or lemon juice must be added. Serve the 
chicken on top of the orange salad. 

RENNET CUSTARD. 

Heat a half pint of milk until it is lukewarm. While the milk 
is heating beat one egg with a teaspoonful of powdered sugar and 
stir the egg and sugar in with it. When the milk is lukewarm 
add one teaspoonful of liquid rennet and one teaspoonful of wine 
or one tablespoonful of rennet wine. Mix all together and let it

•beaf tea. 

For a pint of beef tea take one pound of beef chopped very fine. 
All the fat is to be cut away. Put it in a bowl with a pint of 
cold water. Let it stand in an earthern bowl at least an hour, 
and longer if possible. Put the water and beef in the sauce pan 
over the fire, and heat them very slowly indeed. When the 
beef tea arrives at the boiling point pour it into a wire sieve 
to allow the juice and the little particles of meat — Aot the 
fibres — to pass through. Season it very lightly, and if any par- 
ticles of fat are visible lay little pieces of white porous paper 
on top of the tea to absorb the fat; serve it hot or cold.
