The Picayune 

Creole 

Cook Book 



FIFTH EDITION 



CHE Question of "a good cook" is now becom- 
ing a very vexing problem. The only remedy 
for this state of filings is for the ladies of the 
present day to do as their grandmothers did, 
acquaint themselves thoroughly with the art 
of cooking in all its important and minutest details, and 
learn how to properly apply them. To assist the good 
house-wives of the present day in this, to preserve to 
future generations the many excellent and matchless 
recipes of our New Orleans cuisine, to gather these up 
from the lips of the old Creole negro couks and the 
grand old housekeepers who still survive, ere they, too, 
pass away, and Creole Cookery, with all its delightful 
combinations and possibilities, will have become a lost 
art, ii, in a measure, the object of this book.

COOK BOOK 




INTRODUCTION 



Not often is there romance and a golden glamour about a cook book. 

A mere cook book! Something that you take into the kitchen with 
you and lay on the kitchen table, while you turn the leaves and hunt down 
an elusive recipe that escapes your memory, often a& you have used it. 
And when you find it at last and lay the rolling-pin across the open page, 
What an assembling there is of "the makin's", and what a stirring and 
mixing! And how certain you are of the result. It is the old, old recipe 
which your mother used, and her mother, and her grandmother, and the 
grandmother caught it from the old-time "Mammy," who could work all 
kinds of magic in that black-raftered kitchen of the long ago. 

There are no rafters in your kitchen nowadays, and you are im- 
mensely proud of your tiled walls and your rows of aluminum and granite- 
ware ; but it is the same old recipe you are working out, in just the same 
old way I 

It was such cookery as this that won the hearts of beruffled gentle- 
men and crinolined ladies in the early nineteenth century, and made them 
declare that never were there such cooks as in New Orleans. Those 
wonder workers of the old kitchens, what magic they wrought, and how 
proud they were of it ! And it was never allowed to become a lost art — 
no, indeed. Rosy girls learned it of the old colored women, and stately 
ladies taught the art and the wondrous secrets to their own rosy girls, 
and so the magic has come down through the generations, until — 

Why, until it has been given to the printed page, and so it is preserved 
here in this most wonderful of all cook books. 

Other cook books have lived and had their day, and possessed meri"^, 
perhaps, but what one of them was it that was ever the embodiment of a 
time filled with romance? 



IV 

All through these pages one will catch the glimpses of long-gone fes- 
tivals, and of the graces and courtesies that made them charming; of the 
vifit and the wisdom that flashed back and forth across the mahogany; of 
the bright eyes, now asleep for this many a year; of the gallant hearts that 
have long since ceased to beat. 

Here they are, in this old Creole Cook Book, which is going through 
its fifth edition, in response to an outcry that arose when the founh edi- 
tion was exhausted. Thousands of homes demand it, because it is the epi- 
tome of good cheer that belonged to old New Orleans. Mothers must need" 
give it to their daughters when they cross the home threshold to journey 
away into homes of their own. Strangers in New Orleans, having once 
become familiar with the delightful and distinctive cookery of this city, 
would fain learn how the thing is done, and so begin to ask for the recipes. 
Here they are — the time-tested, the incomparable! Nowhere is there any- 
thing like it. Study it, madame, and follow the path laid down, and you 
cannot fail to arrive. 

How it came about? From France came the chefs of that day to make 
their fortunes in the new world — and established themselves here with the 
young colony. From Spain came the best cooks of that sunny clime — -and 
settled down beside the French artists. After awhile they borrowed ideas 
from one another. After a still longer while the people of the new world, 
who learned from them, adapted what they learned to their needs and 
to the materials they had at hand. 

The result was beyond speech. 

Chefs? 

Perhaps there are still living many of the older generation who 
haunted the old French restaurants, they of the sanded floor and the in- 
comparable cuisine. The names of the great chefs which, became identi- 
fied with New Orleans in those long-gone years may be still unforgotten. 
What of that delightful "Mme. Eugene," who presided at Moreau's, when 
it was near the French Market? All of the gourmets of that time used 
to eat there, and many a visit was paid to New Orleans simply that one 
might sit at the table where Mme. Eugene's famous dishes could 
be set before them. Alex Hause, Arthur Gary— as one remembers, they 
were at the old Boudreaux House at Miln«burg, when that resort was 
in its glory, and the elite used to make it their meal-time rendezvous. As 
for "Miguel," there must be many who remember Miguel, also at Milne- 
burg, one of the most noted of the great chefs of his time. There was 
John Straner, too — his place was on the site now occupied by the Cosmo- 
politan Hotel, in Bourbon street. Charles Rhodes will be remembered 
by every man who ever dined at Moreau's, when it was in. Canal street— 
when that restaurant was one of the most noted, not only in New Or- 



V 

leans, but in the world. Victor Bero — who of the old-timers will ever 
forget him or his magic cookery? Micas, at old Spanish Fort — alas, that 
he should be only a memory I Andre Camors, who established one of the 
great restaurants of the city, in St. Charles street, succeeded by his 
nephew, L,eon Lamothe — this became one of the best-known houses in the 
United States. 

As for the name of Begue — ^who will ever forget the quaint dining 
room near the French ^iarket, and the little kitchen looking into it, with 
Madame Begue, she of the skilled touch, compounding such fare as never 
mortal dreamed of before. And there are the Alciatores, grandfather and 
father and sons — still do they work their ancient magic in places known 
as "Antoine's"' and "The Louisiane" — with all the art of the brave old 
days brought down and modernized to fit the brave new times. 

In this name alone one may find the charm of the French cookery 
which belongs especially to New Orleans. There was one of the name, 
born in Marseilles, set at his life work at 12 years old, and becoming so 
proficient that at 17 he was assistant chef in a great hotel at Marseilles. 
There is another of the name who for the past ten years has spent 
months out of every year in Paris, learning new things — as the efficient 
teacher spends the summer in the great Eastern universities; and who 
has brought back a diploma from Paris — an honor of which to be proud. 

He is a great chef ! 

He belongs to New Orleans ! 

It is the lore of such men as this which has made the Creole Cook 
Book possible. 

Men who have begun to learn how to cook at 10 or 12 years of age 
have grown up, and have passed their knowledge on to their sons. The 
art of the noted restaurants has spread outward into the homes ; and so 
the city has acquired its wondrous reputation as a creator of splendid 
culinary triumphs. 

But there has been another adaptation. After the tidal wave of war 
had swept over the land and left it wrecked, the housewives of the Creole 
city had to learn such rigid economy as they had never known. 

Behold! 

The recipes must be made to fit slender purses ! 

And it was done 1 

Therefore it is that the Creole Cook ■ Book may be taken into the 
humblest kitchen and made to produce delightful dishes "out of nothing." 

That is the magic of the Creole Cook Book, which The Times-Pica- 
jrune is sending out upon its fifth journey to meet its old friends, and to 
make new ones along the road.

CHAPTER I. 



CREOLE OOI'FEE. 



Cafe a la Creole. 



Travelers the world over unite in 
praise of Creole Coffee, or "Cafe a la 
Creole," as they are fond of putting it. 
The Creole cuisinieres succeeded far be- 
yond «ven the famous chefs of France in 
discovering the secret of good coffee- 
making, and they have never yielded the 
palm of victory. There is no place in the 
world in which the use of coffee is moi-e 
general than in the old" Creole city of 
New Orleans, where, from the famous 
French Market, with its world-renowned 
coffee stands, to the olden homes on the 
Bayou St. John, from Lake Pontchartrain 
to the verge of Southport, the cup of 
"Cafe Noir," or "Cafe au Lait," at morn- 
ing, at noon and at night, has become a 
necessary and delightful part of the life 
of the people, and the wonder and the 
joy of visitors. 

The morning cup of Cafe Noir is an 
integral part of the life of a Creole 
household. The Creoles hold as a physio- 
logical fact that this custom contributes 
to longevity, and point, day after day, 
to examples of old men and women of 
fourscore, and over, who attest to the 
powerful aid they have received through 
life from a good, fragrant cup of coffee 
in the early morning. The ancient resi- 
dents hold, too, that, after a hearty 
meal, a cup of "Cafe Noir," or black cof- 
fee, will relieve the sense of oppression 
so apt to be experienced, and enables 
the stomach to perform its functions with 
greater facility. Cafe Noir is known, too, 
as one of the best preventives of infec- 
tious diseases, and the ancient Creole 
physicians never used any other deodo- 
rizer than passing a chafing dish with 
burning grains of coffee through the 
room. As an antidote for poison the uses 
of coffee are too well known to be di- 
lated upon. 

Coffee is also the greatest brain food 
and stimulant known. Men of science, 
poets and scholars and journalists have 
testified to its beneficial effects. Coffee 
supported the old age of Voltaire, and 
enabled Pontenelle to reach his one hun- 
dredth birthday. Charles Gayarre, the il- 
lustrious Louisiana historian, at the ad- 
vanced age of 80, paid tribute to the 
Creole cup of "Cafe Noir." 

How important, then, is the art of mak- 
ing good coffee, entering, as it does, so 
largely into the daily life of the Amer- 
ican people. There is no reason why the 
secret should be confined to any section 
or city; but, with a little care and atten- 
tion, every household in the land may en- 



joy its morning or after-dinner oup of 
coffee with as much real pleasure as the' 
Creoles of New Orleans, and the thou- 
sands of visitors who yearly migrate to 
this old Franco-Spanish city. 

The Best In^rredients and the Proper 
Making. 

The best ingredients are those delight- 
ful coffees grown on well-watered moun- 
tain slopes, such as the famous Java and 
Mocha coffees. It must be of the best 
quality, the Mocha and Java mixed pro- 
ducing a concoction of a most delightful 
aroma and stimulating effect. One of the 
first essentials is to "Parch the Coffee 
Grains Just Before Making the Coffee," 
because coffee that has been long parched 
and left standing loses its flavor and 
strength. The coffee grains should "Be 
Roasted to a Rich Brown," and never al- 
lowed to scorch or burn, otherwise the 
flavor of the coffee is at once affected or 
destroyed. Bear this in mind, that the 
GOOD CREOLE COOK NEVER BOILS' 
COFFEE, but insists on dripping it, in a 
covered strainer, slowly — DRIP, DRIP, 
DRIP — till all the flavor is extracted. 

To reach this desired end, immediately 
after the coffee has been roasted and 
allowed to cool in a covered dish, so that 
none of the flavor will escape, the 
coffee is ground — neither too fine, for 
that will make the coffee dreggy; nor too 
coarse, for that prevents the escape of 
the full strength of the coffee juice — but 
a careful medium proportion, which will 
not allow the hot water pouring to 
run rapidly through, but which will 
admit of the water percolating slowly 
through the grounds, extracting every 
bit of the strength and aroma, and fall- 
ing speedily with "a drip! drip!" into the 
coffee pot. 

To make good coffee, the water must 
be "freshly boiled," and must never be 
poured upon the grounds until it has 
reached the good boiling point, otherwise 
the flavor is destroyed and subsequent 
pourings of boiling water can never quite 
succeed in extracting the superb strength 
and aroma which distinguish the good 
cup of coffee. 

It is of the greatest importance that 
"The Coffee Pot Be Kept Perfectly 
Clean," and the good cook will bear in 
mind that absolute cleanliness is as nec- 
essary for the "interior" of the coffee 
pot as for the shining "exterior." This 
tact is one too commonly overlooked, and 
yet the coffee pot requires more than 



ordinary care, for the reason that the 
chemical action of the coffee upon the 
tin or agate tends to create a substance 
which collects and clings to every crevice 
and seam, and, naturally, in the course 
of time, will affect the flavor of the 
coffee most peculiarly and unpleasantly. 
Very often the fact that the coffee tastes 
bitter or muddy arises from this fact. 
The ■ inside" of the coffee pot should, 
therefore, be washed as carefully "every 
day" as the outside. 

Having observed these conditions, pro- 
ceed to make the coffee according to the 
following unfailing 

Creole Rule. 

Have the water heated to a good bodl. 
Set the coffee pot in front of the stove; 
never on top, as the coffee will boil, and 
then the taste is destroyed. 

Allow one cup, or the ordinary mill, 
of coffee to make four good cups of the 
liquid, ground and put in the strainer, 
being careful to keep both the strainer 
and the spout of the coffee pot covered 
to prevent the flavor from escaping. 
Pour, first, about two tablespoonfuls of 
the boiling water on the coffee ground's, 
or, according to the . quantity of coffee 
used, just sufficient to settle the grounds. 
■Wait about five minutes; then pour a 
little more water, and allow it to drip 
slowly through, but never pour water tha 
second time until the grounds have 
ceased to puff or bubble, as this is an in- 
dication that the grounds have settled. 
Keep pouring slowly, at intervals, a little 
boiling water at a time, until the delight- 
ful aroma of the coffee begins to escape 
from the closed spout of the coffee pot. 
If the coffee dyes the cup it is a little too 
strong, but do not go far beyond this, 
or the coffee will be too weak. When 
you have produced a rich," fragrant con- 
coction, whose delightful aroma, filling 



the room, is a constant tempting mv^^- 

?a"i?o^us"c°r"eorc\Je^^No!r.7o^ «fen« 
S™d at morning dawn, at breakfast, and 
as the "after-dinner cup. 

If the coffee appears muddy, or not 
cleir, some of the ".'d Creoles drop a 
piece of charcoal an inch thick into the 
water, which settles it and at once makes 
it clear Demonstrations prove that 
strength remains in the coffee grounds. 
A matter of economy in making coffee is 
to save the grounds from the meal or day 
before and boil these in a half gallon of 
water. Settle the grounds by dropping 
two or three drops of cold water in, and 
pour the water over the fresh grounds. 
This is a suggestion that rich and poor 
might heed with profit. 

CAFE AU LAIT. 

Proceed in the same manner as In the 
making of "Cafe Noir," allowing the 
usual quantity of boiling water to the 
amount of coffee used. When made, pour 
the cofee into delicate china cups, al- 
lowing a half cup of coffee to each cup. 
Serve, at the same time, a small pitcher 
of very sweet and fresh cream, allowing 
a half cup o* cream to a half cup of 
coffee. The milk should always be boiled, 
and the cream very hot. If the cream is 
not fresh and sweet, it will curdle the 
coffee, by reason of the heat. Cafe au 
Lait is a great breakfast drink in New 
Orleans, while Cafe Noir Is more gen- 
erally the early morning and the after- 
noon drink. 

Having thus bid its readers "Good 
morning," and drank "with them a cup of 
Cafe Noir, The Times-Picayune will pro- 
ceed to discuss Creole Cookery in all its 
forms, from soup "a la Creole," to "pa 
candes amandes" and "pralines." 



CHAPTER II. 



SOUPS. 



General Directions for Making Soup—The Pot-au-Feu, the Bouillon and thi 

Consomme. 



Uncooked meat is the base of all soups, 
except such as the Creoles call "Maigre," 
or fast-day soups. These delightful 
Cream Soups, or Purees, will be special- 
ly treated later. They enter largely into 
the domestic life of New Orleans, as also 
more particularly the Pot-au-Feu, the 
Bouillon and the Consomme. These three 
are the "mother-soups," for upon their 
careful preparation depend taste, flavor 
and the entire problem of good soup- 
making. 

The ancient Creole preserved with few 
modifications many of the customs of 
their French ancestors. Among these was 
the daily plate of soup. 

In France soup enters far more largely 
into the life of the people than in this 
old French city of New Orleans. The 
morning cup of bouillon is served in the 
most exclusive homes. A cup of claret 
and a plate of good soup is the essential 
morning portion of the peasantry. The 
Creoles relegated the morning cup of 
bouillon, but retained the daily serving 
of soup at dinner, in time introducing as 
a '^frequent substitute that exclusive 
Creole concoction Gumbo. No dinner Is 
considered complete without either. The 
custom has been sustained and adopted 



by American residents of New Orleans, 
The Creole housewife lays the greatest 
stress upon two great essentials in th» 
making of good soup; in the first place, 
the soup must never stop boiling one 
instant until done; secondly, once tha 
soup is started, water must never be 
added. Neither, on the other band, must 
the soup be allowed to boil rapidly, or 
it will be muddy and lose much of its 
flavor and strength by evaporation. The 
"soup bone," or "bouilli," as we call U 
down here in New Orleans, must be put 
on in cold water, without salt, and must 
heat slowly. The pot must be kept well 
covered, and no salt must be added until 
the meat is thoroughly cooked, as the 
addition of salt tends to harden the fibers 
of the meat and prevents the free flow 
of the Juices. At no stage of the pro- 
ceeding must the soup be allowed to 
boil fast. If the bone has been frac- 
tured every inch of its length, the soup 
will be all the stronger and more nutri- 
tious. The beef should be selected for 
Its quality, as freshly killed as possible, 
and preferably of the cut known by 
butchers as "The Horseshoe." To ' ba 
most nutritious the soup should boll a 
long time. The Creoles never serve soup 



that has been cooking less than five or 
seven hours, according to the quantity 
to be served. In a well-regulated house- 
hold the soup is put on at brealcfast 
time, in the rear of the stove, and al- 
lowed to cook slowly for four or five 
hours, until the time comes for puttins 
on the dinner proper. In the meantime, 
the fire has been replenished slowly from 
time to time, so that when the moment 
for adding the vegetables or other in- 
gredients arrives, the strength of the 
meat has been nearly or quite extracted. 

The two suggestions, "Never allow the 
soup to cease boiling when once it has 
begun, and never to add water after the 
ingredients are once put together and be- 
gin to boil," have been called the "Golden 
Rule" of soup-making. The housekeeper 
should take them to heart, for -upon their 
strict observance depends that boon to 
poor, suffering humanity — a good plate 
of soup. If these rules are learned and 
reliably follOTyed, the first step has been 
taken towards setting a good dinner. 

Rice flour, arrowroot or corn-starch 
mixed with a little water are often used 
to thicken soups; but every good Creole 
cook knows that the soup that is prop- 
erly made needs no thickening. Salt 
should be used sparingly, as also spices, 
which should always be used whole. 

To be palatable, soup must be served 
very hot. 

It is generally estimated that in pre- 
paring soups a pound of meat should be 
allowed for every quart of water. In the 
following recipes the ingredients must 
be increased proportionately, according 
to the number of persons to be served. 
The intelligent housekeeper can readily 
determine the exact measurements needed 
In her family, increasing proportion;* 
when guests are expected at the family 
table. 

The Every-Day Pot-au-Feu, or 
Simple Bouillon. 

The Pot-au-Peu, or Bouillon, is mad? 
by boiling a good soup bone which h.an 
been carefully selected for its nutritive 
qualities in water a certain length of 
time, by means of which the nutriment 
is extracted. Bouillon of the best quality 
can only be made from good meat, which 
should be chosen from the fleshy, juicy 
part of the thigh. Meat from the breast 
or lower ribs makes good Pot-au-Feu, 
but of a lighter quality, and is preferred 
by some Creole euislnieres. 

The vegetables used are found in the 
"soup bunch," which comprises pieces 
of cabbage, a turnip or two, carrots, 
parsley, celery and onion. Many Creole 
cooks add garlic and cloves, thyme, bay 
leaf and allspice. But this is a matter of 
taste. The every-day Bouillon is made 
by boiling the soup bone for four or five 
hours, skimming carefully as the scum 
rises, and adding, as it starts boiling 
well, the vegetables contained in the 
"soup bunch." If vermicelli, macaroni 
or other soup is desired, such as can be 
made from the simple Bouillon, or Pot- 
au-Feu, these ingredients are added in 
the proportions mentioned in the special 
recipe for these soups, and the soup is 
boiled an hour or so longer. 

The Herb Bouqnet. 

Every good Creole cook keeps on hand 
an "herb bouquet," made of a spray of 
parsley, a sprig of thyme, celery and 
bay leaf. These are tied together, 
*nd constitute the "bouquet." It wiil 
flavor a gallon of soup, if cooked for an 
hour. 



Pot-au-Feu a la Creole. 

4 Pounds of Lean Beef. 

6 Quarts of Cold Water. 

2 Small Turnips. 2 Onions. 2 Carrots. 

1 Parsnip. 1 Cup of Cut-up Tomatoes. 

2 Whole Cloves. . 

1 Bay Leaf. 1 Clove of Garlic. 5 Allspice. 

.' 2 Irish Potatoes. 

Small Piece of Lemon Peel. 

Small Piece of Red Pepper Pod. 

Bunch of Celery Leaves (Chopped). 

Bunch of Parsley (Chopped). 

Pinch of Salt. Pinch of Black Pepper. 

Sprig "of Cabbage. 

This Pot-au-Feu, .properly made, is 
truly delicious, savory and delicately 
odorous. The best cut for this is from 
the round lower end of the beef. Many 
of the Creoles add the beef spleen or 
brisket to the soup. This is rich and 
juicy,' and gives nutritive value to the 
dish. If delicacy is preferred to rich- 
ness in the soup, the ma,TTaw bone is 
omitted. Put the meat into cold water, 
heating by slow degrees in order that It 
may gradually penetrate the meat, soften- 
ing it and dissolving the non-nutritive 
portion, which rises to the top of th3 
liquid as a scum. As the scum becomes 
thicker remove it. After having skimmed 
well, set the soup back where it can be 
kept on a gentle but steady boll; when 
the soup is well skimmed, add the vege- 
tables, which have been cut to proper 
fineness, and a little salt to suit the 
taste, and let the soup continue to boil 
from /ive to six hours, remembering 
strictly the two essential rules given. By 
following this recipe you will have an 
excellent soup. 

The Creoles often serve the Pot-au-Feu 
with small squares of dry or toasted 
bread, put into the tureen, and the hot 
soup is poured over them at the moment 
of serving. 

Should the flavor of the garlic, all- 
spice, cloves or bay leaf be disagreeable, 
they ma;r be omitted. But they are es- 
sential ir gredients of the Creole Pot-au- 
Feu. 

A particularly delicate flavor is often 
obtained by adding to the beef some 
pieces of raw fowl, or the remains of a 
cooked fowl, more especially the carcass. 
But never add remains of mutton, pork 
or veal, as these meats impart an acrid 
odor, detracting from the perfection of 
the Pot-au-Feu. 

Bouillon. 

To make a good Bouillon is an art 
in itself.' It is the soup that most fre- 
quently, after the Pot-au-Feu, enters into 
the economy of the Creole household. It 
is not only used in the daily menu, but 
on occasions of family reunions and 
soirees, is served cold or warm in oups. 
It is always prepared in a concentrated 
form for the use of invalids. In illness, 
where the quantity administered is re- 
quired to be as nutritious as possible, the 
round steak should always be chosen for 
the Bouillon, and it is decidedly better 
not to clear the soup, as the process of 
clearing not only destroys a great deal 
of the delicate flavor, but also of the 
nutriment contained in the Bouillon. 

Select good fresh beef, and where in- 
tended for an invalid allow two pounds 
of beef to every quart of water. The 
Bouillon should always boil from six to 
seven hours. For dinners, luncheons, 
etc., the following proportions may be 
used: 



6 Pounds of Beef, wittiout Bone or Fat 

6 Quarts of Cold Water. 

4 Cloves. 6 Allspice. 

A Small Cup of Fresh or Canned Toma- 

toes. 

1 Teaspoon of Salt. 

1 Spoon of Celery Seed. 

1 Bay Leaf. 

A Piece of Red Pepper Pod, without 

Seeds. 

(Omit for the Sick.) 

1 Clove of Garlic (Omit for the Sick). 

Put these ingredients into the soiip 
kettle, after the Bouillon has been 
brougrht to a boil. Then set aside and let 
it simmer gently, but never allow the 
soup to rack. After two and a half 
hours add 

A Sprig of Thyme. 

1 Onion, cut in pieces. 

1 SYnall Bunch of Celery, if you have not 

used the seed. 

1 Medium -Sized Carrot, chopped fine. 

Replace the cover and let the Bouillon 
boil gently for two and one-half hours 
more, making five hours of actual boil- 
ing, when not intended for invalid use. 
At this stage, from the quantity of in- 
gredients used in the above recipe, the 
Bouillon will measure about three quarts 
for family use. If you decide not to clar- 
ify the soup, set it aside and let it settle 
then carefully pour off the upper por- 
tion, but do not shake the hcwl or dis- 
turb the sediment. The Creoles then add 
about a tablespoonful of celery and a 
little cayenne. This soup requires no 
artificial coloring, its own strength and 
long boiling producing a beautiful tint. 
Should a greater quantity be required, 
the housekeeper will guide herself ac- 
cording to the proportions given in this 
recipe. 

To Clarify Bouillon. 

To clarify Bouillon, remove the fat and 
pour the broth into a clear kettle. Add 
Set it on the fire, and from the moment 
the crushed shells of two eggs. Stir 
this into the cold soup until well mixed. 
it begins to boil let it cook steadily ten 
minutes longer. Set it back on the stove 
or hearth for four or five minutes to 
settle. Then strain it through a to-wel. 
Allow the Bouillon to drip, remembering 
never to squeeze the bag. A very clear 
soup is never a very nutritious one. 

Consomine. 

6 Pounds of Lean Beef. 

2 Large-Sized Onions. 

2 Carrots. 2 Stalks Celery. 

1 Piece of Cabbage. 
Salt and Cayenne to Taste. 

A Consc-mme is a clear soup. 

Select six pounds of lean beef, rump 
of beef and some bones, and cut the meat 
into small pieces, the bones also being 



mashed. Put this on in about six quarts 
SI co?d water, and. when it comes to a 
boil, skim well. Add a teaspconful of 
salt to help the scum rise more tnor- 
oughlv and skim as it rises. Take two 
large-sized onions, two carrots, a piece 
of cabbage and two pieces of celery; chop 
fine and add to the soup, and let it boU 
six hours, or until the broth is reduced 
about one-half the quantity. By this 
time the meat should be cooked into rags. 
Pass all through a colander and then 
strain through a coarse flannel cloth. 
Season highly with Cayenne pepper and 
salt to the taste. If the meat is good, 
the soup will be perfectly clear. If it is 
cloudy or nmddy before straining, crush 
the shells or two eggs and put them into 
the soup and let it come to a good boll. 
Set it back abcut ten minutes and then 
strain. Add vermicelli, or macaroni, or 
pates, according to taste. This soup will 
require no artificial coloring. 

Coloring:s for Soup. 

Having given the recipes for the 
"mother soups," which are the bases 
of all soups, a word must be said about 
colorings for soup. While colorings have 
been extensively used in New Orleans, 
the good old Creoles long ago found out 
thai coloring matter, whether in liquid 
form or in balls or tablets, detracted from 
the good flavor of the soup, and that a 
properly made soup needed no coloring. 
The good Bouillon has a color peculiar 
to itself — a reddish yellow, which comes 
from the juice of the meat. The absence 
of natural color in the soup indicates 
that too small an amount of meat has 
been used in proportion to the water, a 
poor quality of meat, or there has been 
a too rapid process of boiling. Still, if 
colorings are desired, the following recipe, 
which is free from the deleterious com- 
pounds sold in stores, has long been used 
by the Creoles for coloring gravies, and 
may be used with good effect in soups. 
It is called by the Creoles 

Caramel. 

Take about a half pint of brown sugar, 
put it in a pan, on a slow fire, and lei 
it burn or parch, slowly stirring all the 
time. When it turns a dark brown, add 
two pints of water and stir well, and then 
bottle. Put it away and use a few drops 
at a time to color and thicken gravies 
and soup broths. Or, take a large raw 
onion, skin and all, and thrust into the 
burning coals. "When it begins to brown 
well, take out of the coals, dust off all 
the ashes and throw into the soup or 
gravy. This will give all the coloring 
that is needed. 

More simple or satisfactory recipes can- 
not be found. Nevertheless, the Creoles 
maintain and demonstrate that the best 
coloring for soups is that produced by 
good material and long boiling. 



CHAPTER III. 
MEAT SOUPS. 



Julienne Soup. 



Potdge a la Julienne. 

5 Pounds of Lean Beef. 5 Quarts of 

Water. 

2 Turnips. 2 Carrots. 2 Onions. 

2 Leaks. A Small Stalk of Celery. 

3 Tomatoes. 

A Small Half-Head of White Cabbage. 

1 Gill of Green Peas. 

The shin of the beef is the best to 
make a good Julienne soup. Set the beef 



and water in a close vessel where they 
will heat gradually. After boiling five 
or six hours add the vegetables. Cut the 
vegetables into long, thin shreds. Take 
a tablespoonful of lard, heat and add the 
vegetables, letting them fry or smothei 
until a golden brown. Then add to the 
boilmg broth. If fresh peas are used 
they must be boiled apart. If canned 
peas, simply add to the broth, after 
throwing in the vegetables. Let them 
cook in the broth one hour longer and. 
serve hot with the vegetables. 



Vermicelli Soup. 

Consomme, ou Potage au Vermicelle. 

1-2 Pint of Broth to Each Person. 

1 Ounce of Vermicelli to Each Person. 

Prepare a good Bouillon, or Pot-au - 
Feu, or Consomme, according to the 
taste of the household, the simple Pot-au- 
Feu being most generally used. A half 
hour before serving add tbe vermicelli to 
the broth, and serve hot. 

Macaroni Soup. 

Potage au Macaroni. 

2 Quarts of Broth. 
1-4 Pound of Macaroni. 

Prepare a good Pot-au-Feu, or Bouil- 
lon, according to directions given, and 
allowing a quarter of a pound of ma- 
caroni to two quarts of broth. Break 
the macaroni into two-inch length pieces 
and add to the boiling broth about a half 
hour before serving. Some housekeepers 
cook the macaroni separately in salted 
boiling water about ten or fifteen min- 
utes, draining thoroughly, and dropping 
into the boiling broth about fifteen min- 
utes before serving. The soup is often 
served with Parmesan cheese, grated. 

Tapioca Soup. 

Potage au Tapioca. 
4 Ounces of Tapioca. 3 Quarts of Broth. 

To three quarts of broth add, about 
forty minutes before serving, four ounces 
of tapioca. The tapioca should be pre- 
, viously soaked a few hours. Stir fre- 
quently in the broth while boiling, and 
serve hot. 

Sago Soup. 

Potage au Sago. 

3 Pints of Broth. 
2 Ounces of Sago. 

The sago should always be soaked over- 
night. Allow two ounces to every three 
pints of broth or Cc'nsonarae. Boil for 
one hour before serving, stirring occa- 
sionally. 

Rice Soup, 

Potage au Riz. 

1-2 Cup of Rice. 

3 Pints of Broth or Consomme. 

Prepare the clear Pot-au-Feu or Con- 
somme. Wh-en nearly done add one-half 
cupful of ricft, which has been thoroughly 
washed and dried. Cook for about 
twenty-five, minutes longer, or until done, 
and serve. 

Barley soup is prepared after the same 
style, using a clear Bouillon or Con- 
somme. 

Okra Soup. 

Potage au Fevi. 

2 Pounds of Beef without fat or bone. 

2 Cups of Okra, chopped fine, 

1-4 Pound of Butter. 4 Quarts of Cold 

Water. 

1 Onion, sliced and chopped. 

Salt and Pepper. 

Cut the beef into small pieces, and 
season well with butter, pepper and salt. 
Fry it in the soup kettle with the onion 
and butter until very brown. Then add 
the cold water and let it simmer for an 
hour and a half. Add the okra and let 
it simmer gently for three or four hours 
longer. 



Ox-Tail Soup. 

Soupe de Queue de Boeuf. 

1 Ox Tail. 

A Bunch of Soup Herbs. 1 Head of 

Celery. 

4 Quarts of Boiling Water. 1 Large 

Onion. 

2 Carrots. 3 Cloves. 

A Sprig of Parsley. 

A Small Slice of Lean Ham or Beef. 

Salt and Pepper. 

Cut the tail in pieces from the joint, 
and cut again into pieces one inch and a 
half in length. Chop the onions very 
fine. Put the onion and a tablespoonful 
of lard into a frying pan and add the ox 
tail. Cook slowly until it begins to 
brown, then add the carrot, cut in pieces 
about the size of a green pea, and about 
a square inch of ham, chopped very fine. 
Let this brown, and when it begins to 
brown nicely, add the thyme, bay leaf, 
three cloves, one clove of garlic, all 
chopped very fine. Let this continue to 
brown, being careful not to burn, and 
then add one tablespoonful of flour, 
dredged in lightly and stirred, and when 
all is nicely browned, add about five 
quarts of Consomme, if you have it; if 
not, five quarts of boiling water and 
three tablespoonfuls of barley. Let it 
cook together about four hours, simmer- 
ing gently, seasoning with salt, pepper 
and cayenne to taste, and when ready to 
serve, add two tablespoonfuls of sherry 
wine. Wine may be omitted. 
Noodle Soup. 
Potage au Nouilles. 
3 Quarts of Good Bouillon or Consomme. 
The Tolks of 3 Eggs. 
The Whites of 2 Eggs. 
1 Cup of Flour. 1-2 Tablespoonful of 
Salt. 

Prepare a good Bouillon or Consomme. 
To a quart of the soup, add noodles made 
as follows: Beat the yolks of three eggs, 
and the whites of two together until very 
light; add one cup of flour, one-half 
teaspoon of salt, and mix with cold 
water; making a stiff paste; roll very 
thin; then roll each strip to form a tube; 
cut in strips, grease and simmer a few 
at a time in boiling salt water for about 
twenty minutes. Simmer the noodles in 
the soup about fifteen minutes. 

Mushroom Soup. 

Potage au Champignones. 

- 1-4 Pound of Good Macaroni. 

1-4 Pound of Fresh Mushrooms or a Half 

Can of Mushrooms. 

1-2 Carrot and Onion. 

3 Tablespoonfuls of Butter. 

2 Pints of Consomme or Bouillon. 

1 Pint of Cream. 

2 Tablespoonfuls of Flour. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

Break the macaroni into pieces of about 
three inches; wash and put into a stew- 
pan, with two quarts of boiling water;, 
add three teaspoonfuls of salt. Let the 
macaroni boil half an hour, and mean- 
while make a sauce. Put .the butter and 
flour in a small stewpan "and beat to a 
cream. Then add the chopped onion, 
carrot and pepper, and remaining salt 
and broth, and heat slowly. When the 
sauce begins to boil, set it back, where 
it will only simmer, for about twenty 
minutes. At the end of that time add 
the cream and then strain the sauce. 
Pour the water from the macaroni, and 
in its place put the sauce and mush- 
rooms; cook for five minutes, and serve 
hot. 



Tlie Creole housekeeper never uses any 
but a silver spoon in cooking fresh, mush- 
rooms. If the spoon is darkened, the 
mushrcoms are not good. This is an in- 
fallible test in using fresh mushrooms. 
The canned French mushrooms are not 
only the best, but the safest. 

Potage Croute-au-Pot. 

3 Quarts of Good Consomme. 

10 Pieces of Dried Toast. 1 Carrot, cut 

fine. 

1 Head of Celery, cut fine. 

1 Turnip, cut fine. 

Croute-au-Pot is one of the most popu- 
lar and excellent Creole soups. Prepare 
a good consomme. In the meantime, par- 
boil the vegetables in salted boiling wa- 
ter. When tender, drain off the water, 
and add to them about two and one-half 
quarts of the boiling cc-nsomme. Let them 
simmer until they are very tender. Pre- 
pare the toasts and put them into a 
saucepan with enough consomme to cover 
them. Simmer gently until the toasts 
have absorbed all the consomme and 
show signs of drying up. Then add a 
little hot co'nsomme, detach them from 
the saucepan, lay them in the tureen 
and pour the soup with the vegetables 
very gently over them. Serve imme- 
diately. 

Savory Soup. 

Potage a la Bonne Menagere. 

4 Pounds of Lean Beef. 4 Quarts of 

Water. 

1 Onion, chopped fine. 

3 Sprigs of Parsley. 1 Bay Leaf. 

1 Sprig of Thyme. 1-2 Cup of Rice. 

3 Tablespocrafuls of Oatmeal. 

1 Tablespoonful of Salt. 1-4 Teaspoonful 

of Pepper. 

Put the meat in four quarts of cold 
water and let it simmer for three hours. 
One hour before serving, add one-half 
cup of rice, which has been soaked in 
water until soft, and three tablespoonfuls 
of oatmeal, one tablespoonful of salt 
and one-fourth teaspoonful of pepper. 
Add parsley, sprig of thyme and one 
onion, chopped fine. Boil an hour longer 
and serve, very hot. This makes a de- 
licious soup. 

Corn Soup. 

Soup au Mai Tendre. 

6 Pounds of the Lower Ribs of Beef. 

6 Quarts of Cold Water. 

1 Quart of Sliced Fresh Tomatoes. 

1 Quart of Corn, sliced from the cob. 

1 Tablespoonful of Butter. 

1 Tablespoonful of Flour. 

One Pod of Cayenne Pepper, without 

Seeds. 

Salt and Black Pepper to Taste. 

Corn soup is one of the most popular 
Creole summer soups, and will be found 
not only delicious, but highly nutritive. 

Put the meat and water into a soup 
pot, and as soon as the scum begins to 
rise skim carefully. Then add the toma- 
toes and corncobs. Cook for four hours 
or so longer ; then take out the corn- 
cobs, and add the corn, cut fine, salt and 
pepper to suit the taste, adding a pod of 
Cayenne pepper, without the seeds; cook 
one hour longer and then serve with 
slices of toast bread. 

Tomato Consomme. 
Consomme de Tomates. 

A Shin of Veal. 

3 Pounds of Shin of Beef. 

8 Quarts of Water. 1 Cup of Tomatoes. 

A Handful of S'orrel (if tomatoes are not 

used). 



Salt and Pepper. 3 Onions. 3 I^^s. 

10 Allspice. 6 Cloves. 3 Large Carrots. 

1 Head of Celery. 1 Bunch of Parsley 

A Chicken may be substituted for the 

Shin of Veal. 

Put the meat and chicken (the latter 
cut up) into a large soup kettle and let 
it come slowly to a boil. Then draw it 
forward, and as it begins to boil more 
rapidly skim as the scum rises. After 
another hour add the pepper, salt and 
vegetables. The soup should boil inces- 
santly, but gently, for about eight hours, 
requiring in all about nine hours of good 
cooking. It should, therefore, be put on 
very early in the morning, and, if re- 
quired for luncheon, should be made the 
day before. AVhen the soup has boiled 
gently for the prescribed time take it off, 
strain into a large bowl and set it away 
in the ice box until the next day, if not 
for immediate use. Then remove the fat 
from the surface, and pour off all the 
clear part into a saucepan and boil 
again for one or two hours. Then re- 
move it from the fire. This will make a 
stiff jelly, which will keep in winter for 
several days in the ice box. It also 
serves to make a beautiful Sauce Espag- 
nole, or Spanish Sauce. The best way to 
keep it is in earthern pitchers holding 
from one to two quarts, allowing a cer- 
tain quantity for each day. 

Mock-Tnrtle Soap. 

Soupe a la Tortue. 

1 Calf's iHead. 1-4 Pound of Calf's Liver. 

5 Quarts of Oold Water. 

Bunch of Soup Herbs. 2 Hard-Boiled 

Eggs. 

2 Tablespooufuls of Butter. 

1 Gill of Sherry. 1 Bay Leaf. 12 Cloves. 

1 Onion. 1 Lemon. 

4 Level Teaspoonfuls of Flour. 

1 Carrot. 1 Turnip. 

1 Level Teaspoonful Mushroom ^Catsup. 

1 Level Teaspoonful ^Vcrcestershire 

Sauce. 

Salt and Pepper to S'uit Taste. 

Select a fine calf's head, not too large. 
If large, reserve half and the tongue and 
brains to make another dish. Get the 
butcher to crack the head well and re- 
move the brains. Wash the head thor- 
oughly in cold water, and then be care- 
ful to pour boiling water through nose 
and throat passages until they are per- 
fectly clean, and scrape out the ears thor- 
oughly, washing very clean. Rinse all 
well in cold water, and be very sure that 
the head is very sweet and clean before 
attempting to cook it. Put the head in a 
kettle with five quarts of cold water, and 
set it over a moderate fire. WTien it be- 
gins to boil well skim thoroughly, till 
every particle of scum has been taken 
off. Then set it back and let it sinuner 
until the meat is qliite tender. This will 
require about two hours and a half. 
Then remove the head ; take the meat 
from the bones; skin the tongue, and set 
away to cool. Return the bones to the 
kettle, with the vegetables, which have 
been washed and cut fine; as, also, the 
spices and the liver. Simmer gently again 
for two hours, and when cool, strain. 
Set aside to cool, and w^hen the soup is 
cold, remove all the fat. Put the butter 
in a saucepan and melt, adding the flour 
until nicely browned, but be careful not 
to burn it. Then add by degrees the boil- 
ing soup, stirring constantly. Boil, keep- 
ing up a gentle stir, for about five min- 
utes. Then add the meat of the head and 
the liver, having first cut them into dice. 



and bring to a boil at once. Take the 
saucepan from tffe fire, and add the oat- 
sup, salt, pepper and wine. Slice the 
hard-boiled eggs and the lemon and place 
them in the tureen, and pour the soup 
over them and serve. 

If force-meat balls are desired for the 
soup, prepare them as follows: 

force-Meat Balls. 

Chop a half of a pound of beef or veal 
and chopped chicken about an inch in 
thickness; add a little of the liver and 
tongue of the calf, a half dozen small 
onions, one tablespoonful of sweet m,ar- 
joram, one grated nutmeg, a teaspO'Onful 
each of powdered black pepper and mace, 
and a half teaspoonful of cloves (pow- 
dered), three eggs, three grated crackers 
(sifted), half a gill of good sherry wine, 
a tablespoonful of butter and two tea- 
spoonfuls of salt; chop up and mix thor- 
oughly together. Then roll in balls and 
fry slowly in lard or butter. Serve with 
the soup. 

Mutton Broth. 

Soupe de Mouton. 

8 Pounds of the Neck of the Mutton. 
4 Quarts of Cold Water. 1-2 Cup of Hice. 

1 Onic-n. 1 Bay Leaf. 

2 Large Turnips. Salt and Pepper to 

Taste. 

Wash the neck of the mutton, or wipe 
it with a damp towel, and put it into 
the kettle with the cold water. Let it 
come to a slow boil and skim carefully. 
Cover well and let it simmer for about 
four hours. Then remove from the stoT^e 
and pour into an earthem vessel to cool. 
When cold, remove all the fat from the 
surface, or, better still, remove all the 
fat before boiling. Return to the kettle 
and add the rice, the sliced turnip and 
the bay leaf, and season to taste, or pre- 
pare as in Oxtail Soup. 

Chicken Broth. 
Bouillon de Volaille. 

To make a good chieken broth for in- 
valids, take one good large chicken; clean 
carefully and cut up, being careful to 
mash all the bones with an ax. Place in 
a saucepan of cold water, and let it sim- 
mer gently for four or five hours, until 
it is 'boiled down to about two cups of 
broth. It will have a rich, strong color, 
and seasoned with a little salt and pep- 
per, omitting all vegetables, can be taken 
by the most delicate stomachs. 
Chicken Consomme. 
Consomme de Volaille. 
1 Large Chicken Cut in Pieces. 
1 Onion. 3 Quarts of Cold Water. 

1 Small Stalk of Celery. 
1 Carrot. 1 Turnip. 

Salt and Pepper. 

Put the chicken Into the salt and water 
and let it simmer gently until the scum 
begins to rise; then skim. Add the other 
ingredients. Boil gently for two hours, 
and serve with slices of toast,. The 
chicken left over will serve to make 
croquettes, or chicken salad. 

Gilt-£dged Consomme. 
Cc-nsomme Dore. 

1 Fine Chicken. 1 Good Soup Bone. 

1 Slice of Fine Ham. 
1 Gallon of Water. 

2 Eggs, whites and shells. 

2 Sprigs of Parsley. 

Half Bach of Small Parsnip, Carrot 

and Head of Celery. 

1 Onion. 3 Cloves. Salt and Pepper. 



Have the fowl thoroughly cleaned, and 
put the chicken, beef and ham into a 
kettle of cold water of the quantity 
mentioned in the above, and boil slowly 
for five hours, being careful to keep the 
pot well covered. Chop the onion and 
vegetables and fry them in a little but- 
ter, and add all the seasonings to the 
soup. Boil two hours longer, and set 
away overnight in an ice box. The next 
day remove all the fat; from the top 
take out the jelly, leaving the thickest 
part o-f the sediment, which is good to 
put into a thick soup. Mix in the shells 
and the whites of eggs and boil quickly 
for about ten minutes. Then set it on 
the hearth to settle. Pour the soup 
through a thin bag without squeezing; 
if it does not come out perfectly clear, 
pass it through again. It should then 
be a beautiful golden-brown color. Only 
the brightest and cleanest of kettles 
should be used, and the sieve should be 
scalded each time to keep the particles 
from washing back into the soup. This 
is a delightful soup for luncheons and 
Dinner parties. It may be garnished ac- 
cording to taste, serving with "Croutons," 
or C^uenelles. 

Consomme With Poached Eees, 

Consomme aux Oeufs Poches. 

6 Eggs. 

3 Quarts of Consomme or Bouillon. 

Break the eggs and drop them ono 
by one into boiling salted water, being 
careful not to allow the water to boil 
when once the eggs are in it; but have 
the frying pan, which is always best for 
poaching eggs, to one side of the stove, 
and cook slowly until the eggs are firm. 
When firm, carefully remove with a 
spoon or perforated skimmer, the latter 
being best, and lay in cold water for 
a moment, until the edges are trimmed 
evenly. The boiling water tends to make 
the edges ragged, and eggs served in this 
slovenly manner are not tempting. Trans- 
fer to the tureen and pour the boiling 
soup very gently into the tureen and 
serve. ^ One egg and about a half-pint of 
broth should be allowed to each person. 

Queen Soup. 
Potage a la Heine. 

1 Chicken. 1-4 Pound of Rice. 

1-2 Pint of C^eam. 

1-4 Blade of Mace. 1 Sprig of Thyme. 

4 Sprigs of Parsley. 

2 Quarts of White Veal Broth. 

Salt and Pepper. 

Take a fine large chicken, clean it and 
put it whole into a pot containing about 
five quarts of water. Add chopped onion, 
thyme, bay leaf, one carrot, a small 
bunch of celery, and one cup of rice. Let 
the chicken simmer well ror about four 
hours, and, when well cooked, take out 
the chicken from the broth. Cut off the 
white meat and cut it into pieces about 
the size of dice. Then strain the broth, 
mashing the rice well. Make a puree by 
taking another saucepan, putting in one 
tablespoonful of butter and one of flour, 
letting it melt together without brown- 
ing. Moisten this well with the soup and 
a glass of milk, and season with salt 
and pepper and one-quarter of a grated 
nutmeg, and add to the broth. Then add 
the chicken, which has been cut up. Put 
in the tureen little dice of croutons of 
bread fried in butter. Pour the soup over 
and serve hot. The remainder of the 
chicken can be used to make Chicken 
Croquettes, Chicken Salad, etc.

CHAPTER IV. 
FISH SOUPS. 



Soupes de Poissons, 

Under this heading come some of the 
most delightful Creole soups, such as 
Green Turtle Soup, Oyster Soup, Craw- 
fish Bisque, etc. These not only serve 
as fast-day soups, but are considered ele- 
gant introductions to the most recherche 
feast. 



Green Turtle Soup. 



Fish Soup. 

Bouillon de Poisson. 

6 Slices of Fish of Almost Any Variety. 

4 Onions, Chopped Fine. 

6 Tomatoes, Chopped Fine. 

1 Herb Bouquet. Sprig of Parsley. 

1 Glass of White Wine. 

4 Tablespoonfuls of Salad Oil. 

4 Tablespoonfuls of Flour. 

3 Pints of Water. 

Chop the onions and fry them in the 
salad oil. Cut the tomatoes fine, add 
onions, and put in all the other ingre- 
dients, except the fish, adding the flour 
to make a good roux. When brc'wn add 
the water, apd, after it has boiled about 
a half hour, add the slices of fish. 
When they are firm remove the herb 
bouquet, add Cayenne pepper, and salt 
and pepper to taste, and serve the fish 
SOU], in a tureen, pouring it over crusts 
of dried toast. 



Soupe a la Tortue. 
2 Pounds of Turtle Meat, or a 2-Pound 
Turtle. 
2 Fine Large Onions. 6 Cloves. 
1 S'quare inch of Ham. 6 Allspice. 
2 Cloves of Garlic. 
2 Tablespoonfuls of Flour. 
1-4 of a Small Lemon. 2 Hard-Boiled 
Eggs. 
1 Glass of Sherry ^\''ine. 
Parsley, Thyme, Bay Leaf. 
Salt, Pepper and Cayenne to Taste. 
The Creoles pride themselves upon their 
famous "Soup a la Tortue," and justly 
the old saying that only a good Creole 
cook knows how to make a good Turtle 
Soup being tesititled to by epicurean vis- 
itors from every country. 

The following is one of the simplest 
and best ways of making Turtle Soup— 
a recipe that may always be relied upon 
and one that has been used from genera- 
tion to gene-.'ition in the most aristocratio 
Creole homes; 

In making Turtle Soup, Green Turtle 
is always the best tor this purpose. 
Sr cct two pounds of Green Turtle meat, 
u the turtle is not bought whole. This 
a.aount will make a soup for six persons 



Increase proportionately. If the turtle 
Is bought whole, first out off the head. 
To dc this properly, the turtle should be 
hung with the head downwards, and a 
very sharp knife should be used to cut 
off the head ag close as possible. To 
remote the shells, first separate the up- 
per from the lower shell, always being 
exceedingly careful to avoid touching the 
gall bladder, which is very large. If it 
is penetrated, the contents running over 
the' turtle meat would render it utterly 
unfit for use. 

Clean the turtle and the entrails by cut- 
ting oijen and washing thoroughly in cold 
water. Then put the meat and entrails 
ir.to a saucepan and parboil about ten 
rairules. Be careful to save this stock 
of water. Chop an onion very fine, and 
thi3 bam into very fine pieces. Cut the 
turtiO meat into one-inch pieces, mash 
the clov-'s aria the allspice very fine and 
chop tho thyme and bay leaf. Brown 
the ciiio;i? in a tablespoonful of butter 
or laril. and add immediately the turtle 
meat. Blown together slightly, and after 
minutes add the chopped ham. Let 
this continue browning and then add 
two cloves of garlic, chopped fine, and 
the thyme, bay leaf (minced fine), cloves 
anJ allspice (ground), all mixed together, 
and lay on the turtle. Stir this almost 
constantly to prevent burning, and add 
two tablespoonfuls of flour that has been 
well rubbed, stirring constantly all the 
time. Then dissolve the meat with the 
water in which the turtle was parboiled, 
adding gradually until a certain consis- 
tency is reached. About three quarts of 
water will be the required amount. 
Season this with salt, black pepper and 
Cayenne to taste, and boil slowly for 
tvllv an hour, stirring almost constantly. 
Af^cr cooking one hour taste, and If not 
ata' oned sufficiently, season again and 
tatte Then chop one-quarter of a small 
lemon, and put it in the soup. Let it 
continue to ccok, and when well done — 
that ia when no blood exudes from the 
turi'.e afLcr sticking it with a fork — pour 
into the tureen. Add the whites and 
yolks o? two hard-boiled eggs, chopped 
fine and one good class of Sherry wine, 
aiiJ the soup is ready to serve. This is a 
dish fit for a king and is most highly 
recommended as a genuine Creole Turtle 
Soup. 

Turtle Soup No. 2. 

Soupe a la Tortue. 

2 Pounds of Turtle Meat. 

1-2 Tablespoonful of Lard. 

1-2 Tablespoonful of Butter. 

2 Tablespoonfuls of Flour. 

2 Tomatoes. 1 Large Onion. 

1 Sprig of Thyme. 2 Sprigs of Parsley. 

1 Bay Leaf. 1 Clove of Garlic. 

1 Square Inch of Ham. 

1 Dozen Cloves Tied in Muslin. 

6 Allspice Mashed Fine. 

3 Quarts of Water. 2 Hard-Boiled Eggs. 

1 Glass of Sherry or White Wine. 

Salt and Cayenne to Taste. 

Criean the turtle and entrails by cut- 
ting open the latter and washing thor- 
oughly in cold water. Then put the meat 
and entrails into a saucepan and parboil 
them for ten minutes. Carefully save 
this stock of water. Chop the onion 
very fine, and cut the ham into very 
fine pieces. Cut the turtle meat into 
one-inch pieces; mash the allspice very 
fine, and mince the parsley, thyme and 
bay leaf. Then brown the onions in the 
lard and butter mixed, and almost imme- 
diately add the turtle meat. Brown to- 



gether for ten minutes and add the finely 
chopped ham. As this continues to brown 
add the cloves of garlic (minced fine), 
the thyme and bay leaf and the ground 
allspice. Mix all together, stirring al- 
most constantly to prevent burning. 
Then add the well-rubbed tablespoonfuls 
of flour, stirring constantly. Scald and 
skin the tomatoes and chop them fine, 
and add to the turtle meat. When well 
browned, pour over three quarts of the 
water in which the turtle was parboiled, 
season with salt and pepper and Cayenne 
to taste, and let it boil slowly for fully 
an hour, stirring frequently. After one 
hour taste the soup, and, if not suffi- 
ciently seasoned, add seasoning of salt, 
pepper and Cayenne again, according to 
taste. Let it cook for an hour longer 
and then take off the stove if the turtle 
is thoroughly done. This may be ascer- 
tained by sticking it with a fork. If no 
blood exudes, the soup is ready to servs. 
Take oft the stove and strain through a 
colander into the tureen. Add the whites 
and yolks ' of two hard-boiled eggs, 
chopped fine, and one good glass of Sher- 
ry or White wine. Slice a lemon fine 
and add to the soup and serve hot. 

How to Serve Turtle Soup. 

Great care should be taken in serving 
the soup. It should be borne in mind 
that boiling the soup a second time, or 
warming it over, deprives it of much of 
its delicious flavor. To avoid this, fill 
two tureens with boiling water; let them 
stand a few minutes, then dry the inside 
thoroughly and place the tureens in a 
"bainmarie," or a hot-water bath. Fill 
the tureens with the soup and cover 
tightly. Bring them to the table as need- 
ed, throwing in, just before serving, some 
dainty slices of lemon. If the meat is 
served, use only the most delicate por- 
tions. 

Mock Eggs for Turtle Soup. 

Should the turtle possess no eggs, the 
following method of making mock eggs 
is often used: Break and beat thoroughly 
one fresh egg; then take the yolks of 
three hard-boiled eggs, and rub them 
into a fine paste with about a teaspoon- 
ful of butter. Mix this with the raw egg 
and roll into pelleits of the identical size 
and shape of the turtle eggs, let them lie 
in boiling water about two minutes, and 
then drop into the soup. 

Terrapin Soup. 

Soupe a la Tortue. 

1 Two-Pound Diamond-Back Terrapin. 

2 Fine Large Onions. 6 Cloves. 

1 Square Inch of Ham., 6 Allspice. 

1-4 of a Small Lemon. 2 Hard-Bolled 

Eggs. 

1 Glass of Sherry Wine. 

Parsley, Thyme and Bay Leaf. 

Salt, Pepper and Cayenne to Taste. 

The diamond-back terrapin is the best 
and the females make the finest and 
daintiest food, the males being not only 
of inferior size, but of far less delicate 
flavor. Terrapins must always be bought 
alive. They are in season from Novem- 
ber till March, ajid, like all other fish, i 
should not be eaten out of season. 

To make the soup, clean the terrapin 
as you would a turtle. Then place in a 
kettle and boil till tender. Take out and 
cut into small pieces, saving the water. 
Proceed as for Turtle Soup. When it 
boils up take from the fire, add a grated 
nutmeg, a glass of Sherry or Madeira 
wine and serve. Serve with green pickle 
and delicate slices of fried toast.

Crawfish Bisqae. 

Potage a la Bisque d'Ecrevisse. 
8 Dozen Pine Large Crawfish. 
3 Onions. 1 Carrat. 1 Bunch of Celery. 
2 Sprigs of Thyme. 2 Bay L*eaves. 
4 Sprigs of Parsley. 6 Cloves. 
2 Blades of Mace. 1 Clove of Garlic. 
2 Tablespoonfuls of Butter. 
2 Quarts of Oyster Liquor. 
A Dash of Cayenne, 1 Seedless Cayenne 
Po^d. 
Salt and Pepper to Taste. 
Take about eight dozen fine, large 
crawfish and wash thoroughly, being 
careful to cleanse of every particle of 
dust or sand. Set to boil in about a gal- 
lon of water. When boiled, take the 
fish out of the water; save the water. 
Pick O'Ut two dozen of the largest craw- 
fish; pick out the inside of the tails and 
save the heads, cleansing them of every 
particle of meat. Set this meat to one 
side with the shells of the head. Pick 
the meat from the rest of the crawfish, 
saving all the shells. Take one large 
onion, a carrot, a bunch of celery, a sprig 
of thyme, one bay leaf, three sprigs of 
parsley, six clc-ves and two blades of 
mace, one clove of garlic; chop all very 
fine and put into the pot of water in 
which the crawfish were boiled. Add all 
the picked meat, except the reserved tails, 
and all the shells of the bodies and heads, 
except the reserved heads. Add one cup 
of rice and let it all boil till the mixture 
becomes thick and mushy. When it is 
well cooked, take it off the fire and 
mash the shells thc-roughly, and the meat 
also, and strain all through a sieve. Taka 
about a tablespoonful of butter and two 
quarts of oyster liquor and add this to 
the soup, seasoning to taste with Cay- 
enne, salt and black pepper. Set to boil 
slowly. In the meantime, take the re- 
served crawfish meat and make a stuf- 
fing as fc-llows for the reserve heads, 
chop an onion very fine and let it brown 
In a tablespoonful of butter. Squeeze 
thoroughly a cup of bread wet with 
water. WTien well squeezed, mix with a 
little milk, sufficient to make a paste, 
season to taste and mix with the well- 
seasoned crawfish meat. Chop another 
onion and put in melted butter, and add 
the crawfish stuffing, letting all fry 
about ten minutes, adding, in the mean- 
time, a finely-chopped sprig each of 
thyme and parsley and a bay leaf, and 
mixing thoroughly. Take off the fire 
and stuff the reserved head of crawfish. 
Put on every stuffed head a dot of but 
ter, and set in the oven and bake ten 
■minutes. Place the stuffed heads in the 
tureen and pour the soup over. Serve 
hot with Croutc-ns of buttered toast, 
passing the latter in a separate dish. 
Crawfish Soup. 
Potage d'Bcrevisses. 
50 Fine, Large Crawfish. 
1 1-2 Pounds of a Fillet of Veal. 
1 Slice of Ham. 
1 Herb Bouquet. 1 Half Can of Mush- 
rooms, 
2 Tablespoonfuls of Flour. 
2 Carrots. 1 Tablespoc'nful of Butter. 
1 Clove of Garlic. 1 Large Onion. 
1 Parsnip. 
1 Dozen Almonds. 1 Dozen Allspice. 
4 Shallots. 6 Tomatoes or a Half Can. 
Croutons. 
Wash the crawfish thoroughly over 
and ©ver again to take away every 
particle of dust. Then boil them in plain 
water. Save the water. Take out the 
crawfish and take off all the shells, put- 
ting the meat aside. Pound the shells 



fine; pound one do^en almonds fine and 
mix thoroughly with the meat of the 
crawfish, and pound this in a mortar. 
In the meanwhile take one pound and a 
half of a filet of veal and a slice of ham 
and cut in small pieces. Cut up the 
onion, carrots and parsnips. Put one 
tablespoonful of lard in a kettle, and 
when it begins to heat add the herb 
bouquet (sweet basil, parsley, bay leaf), 
the onions, parsnip, shallots, clove of 
garlic, chopped fine; as these brown add 
the veal and ham. Add two tablespoon- 
fuls of flour and butter rubbed, and the 
mushrooms, chopped finely. Let these 
simmer for about five minutes and then 
add the tomatoes, allspice and cloves. 
After ten minutes, when the mixture is 
well browned, add the pounded crawfish 
shells and the pounded meat and al- 
monds. Pour over all the water from 
the boiled crawfish and set it back on 
the stove and let it simmer for about 
two hours. Skim off all the grease when 
near time for serving. Then strain 
through a sieve and serve with Croutons 
of toast, cut in slices, placed in the bot- 
tom of the tureen. 

On fast days, instead of the veal and 
ham, substitute butter and lard, making 
a Roux (see recipe), and moistening a 
little with the stock of the crawfish. 
Then proceed as above. 

Rice or Crouton Soup is rendered de- 
licious by introducing a small quan- 
tity of the broth of a crawfish. The 
broth is also used extensively by the 
Creoles in seasoning ragouts on fast 
days, and hot pies, such as pates de foles 
gras; also such .entremets as cauliflower, 
artichokes, etc. The chief essential in 
making the broth is to have it of the 
right consistency, and to skim carefully 
of all the grease before straining. Good 
judgm^ent must be the guide of the cook 
in seeking the proper consistency. 

Oyster Soup. 

Soupe aux Huitres. 

4 Dozen Large, Fresh Oysters. 
1 Quart of Rich Milk. The Oyster Liquor 

1 Tablespoonful of Butter. 

3 Sprigs of Parsley. Chopped Fine. 

1 Dozen Pepper Corns. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 
In purchasing the oysters always ba 
careful to make the vendor add the 
oyster juice when intended fdr soup. In 
making good oyster soup the Creoles 
never use any water, but the liquor from 
the oysters. Drain the oysters througa 
a colander and set them over the ice box 
, to keep fresh and cold. Strain the liquor, 
and put it into a soup kettle, adding the 
chopped parsley and the pepper corns. 
Let it come to a boil. In the meantime 
boil the milk separately in a saucepan, 
as boiling the milk and ovster juice to- 
gether is likely to curdle the milk. "S^Tien 
the milk comes to a boil, add to the 
oyster juice and put in the tablespoonful 
of butter. Stir the soup constantly ai 
this point, throwing in the ovsters and 
continuing to stir until it comes to a 
boil again. Under no circumstances al- 
low the oysters to boil, as that destroys 
their flavor and makes them tough and 
indigestible. But one must be also care 
ful to see that they are steamed through 
and through, and then they are delight- 
ful and palatable. The ruffling of tha 
edges indicates the right condition; a* 
this point the soup must be served im- 
mediately. Serve with sliced lemon and 
oyster or water crackers. Made accord- 
ing to the above formula, oyster soup is 



11 



a most delightful dish and can be eaten 
and relished by the most delicate stom- 
achs. 

Oyster Soup Without MUk. 

Soupe aux Huitres a la Creole. 

The Creoles have another delightful 
method of preparing oyster soup, a 
method evolved by the old negro cooks of 
ante-bellum days, and still in vogue in 
the ancient families. It is a soup made 
without milk, and is prepared as follows: 
Take 

4 Dozen Baycu Cook Oysters. 

The Oyster Liquor. 

1 Liarge Onion. 1 Tablespoonful of Lard. 

2 Tablespoonfuls of Sifted Flour. 

i Sprigs of Parsley. 1 Tablespoonful of 

Butter. 

1 Quart of Boiling Water. 

Put the tablespoonful of lard into the 
soup kettle. Have ready one onion, som;j 
parsley, chopped very fine. When the 
lard is hot, stir in two taiblespoonfuls of 
sifted flt)ur, and make a Brown Roux 
(see recipe), stirring constantly to pre- 
vent burning. When the Roux is of a 
light brown color add the chopped onions 
and parsley, continuing to stir, being 
exceedingly careful to avoid the sem- 
blance of burning. Strain the oyster 
juice of about four dozen oysters into 
the Roux, mixing thoroughly to avoid 
bits of shell; mix with about a quart of 
boiling water and pour. When it shows 



signs of coming to a bo'il, add the oysters 
and a teaspoonful of butter. At the boil- 
ing point remove from the stove and 
serve with oyster soda crackers or dry 
toast, the oyster crackers being always 
preferable. 

Grab Soup. 

Potage de Crabes. 

1 Dozen Fine Crabs. 6 Ripe Tomatoes. 

1 Sprig of Thyme. 3 S'prigs of Parsley. 

1 of Sweet Marjoram. 

1 Large Onion. 1 Clove of Garlic. 

1 Teaspoonful of Butter. 

2 Tablespoonfuls (level) of Lard. 

1 Lemon. 
Salt, Pepper and Cayenne. 

Cleanse the crabs thoroughly and ex- 
tract all the meat from the bO'dy and 
claws; scald and skin the tomatoes, and 
squeeze the pulp from the seeds and 
juice; chop very fine. Pour boiling water 
over the seed and juice and strain. Chop 
the onion and garlic and stew with the 
tablespoonful of butter and lard. As 
they begin to brown add the tomatoes, 
cover, and, after simmering a few min- 
utes, add the well-seasoned meat of the 
crab. Sift over this some grated bread 
or crackers and season with Cayenne, 
sweet marjoram and thyme. Pour in to- 
mato water and add about a quart or 
more of water, and let it boil moderately 
for about an hour. Add the juice of two 
lemons and serve. 



CHAPTER V. 
IBNTBN SOUPS 
Potages Malgre. 



The Creoles excel in the preparation 
of soups without meat, or fast-day soups, 
as they are called. The ingenuity of the 
cooks from generation to generation has 
been taxed in the preparation of these 
soups, which are in great vogue during 
the Lenten season. But many of them, 
such as "Cream of Asparagus Soup,'' 
"Cream of Celery Soup," have entered 
into the daily life of the city, and, like 
the famous Creole Gumbos, are held afi 
dainty and elegant introductions to the 
most distinguished feasts.

Let all boil till the water has evaporated, 
and then add one pint of red or white 
beans or split peas, which have been 
soaked overnight; add three quarts of 
water and the pepper pod, and let all 
simmer well for three hours. Then if the 
beans are perfectly tender at this point, 
drain or press through a colander; re-

Wash the lentils, and, if dried, soak 
them over night. Drain off the water 
and put them in a saucepan with the 
cold water. Allow them to come grad- 
ually to a boil. Then set them back on 
the stove and let them simmer gently for 
about two hours. Melt the butter in the 
saucepan and fry in it the minced onion, 
celery, parsley, thyme and bay leaf, and 
let these brown; then add them to the

water, and cover the kettle well. Let the 
feet come to a slow boil and skim care- 
fully. Then add the blades of mace and 
let the soup boil slowly till the meat Is 
reduced to rags and has fallen from the 
bones. Then strain into a white porce- 
lain dish or pan, and set it away to cool. 
After it has congealed, scrape off fat and 
sediment, and a beautiful jelly will re- 
main. Cut up this cake of jelly and put 
it into a thoroughly cleansed, white por- 
celain soup kettle. In the meantime grate 
the cocoanut very fine, till about a half 



pound is on hand. Mix thi* wltn the pint

meg. The soup should then be set back

Follow the rule given for making soups, 
by allowing a pound of meat to each 
quart of water. Skim and boil till the 
meat falls into rags; then strain and put 
in a clean porcelain pot. In the mean- 
time shell the chestnuts and throw them 
into boiling water until the skin comes 
off easily. Put them into a saucepan 
with some of the soup water, and boil 
about thirty minutes, till quite soft. Press 
through a colander; add butter, pepper 
and salt. Then add to the soup. Make 
dumplings the size of a marble with fresh 
butter rolled in flour; and add. (See 
recipe for Dumplings.) Boil the soup 
about fifteen minutes longer and serve. 
Some prefer the soup without dumplings, 
thinking it gives more of the flavor of 
the chestnuts. On fast days use the oys- 
ter water instead of the beef broth, fol- 
lowing the recipe in all other particulars, 
and adding a half tablespoonful of butter 
to the puree before pressing through the 
colander. 



CHAPTER VI. 
THE BOUILLI. 

"Le Bouilli." 



The Creoles long ago discovered, or, 
rather, brought over with them from the 
mother country, France, the delightful 
possibilities for a good entree that lurked 
within the generally despised and cast 
aside Bouilli, and these possibilities they 
improved upon in their own unique and 
palatable styles of cuisine preparations. 

In France the "Bouilli" is always 
served at the home dinner, and so with 
the new France, New Orleans. Far from 
rejecting the "Bouilli" as unpalatable 
and unfit for food, the Creoles discovered 
many delightful ways of serving it, and 
their theories of the nutrition that still 
remained in the boiled beef have been 
sustained by medical science. The most 
eminent scientists have found by experi- 
mtent that while heat coagulates the nu- 
tritious substances of the beef, only a 
small amount is dissolved when the wa- 
ter is heated gradually, and that the 
"Bouilli" is still valuable as an article of 
food. 

The pleasant ways that the Creoles 
have of preparing it restores its flavor 
and makes it a delightful accompani- 
ment to even the most aristocratic din- 
ners. For breakfast the boiled beef left 
over is utilized in various ways. 

We have selected from among many 
the following recipes, which need only to 
be tried to be repeated often, in one form 
or the other. 



The recipes for the sauces mentioned 
will be found in the chapter especially 
devoted to "Creole S'auces." 

Mirontons. 

The Left-Over Bouilli.

1 Clove of Garlic. 1 Sprig of Thyme. 

1 Bay Leaf. 2 Pickles. 

1 Tablespoonful of Flour. 

1 Tablespoonful of Butter. 

Salt, Pepper and Cayenne to Taste. 

This is a favorite way the Creoles have 
of serving the cold bouilli that has been 
saved from tlie preceding day: 

Slice the onions fine; brown in one 
tablespoonful of butter. Chop the shal- 
lots and add to the onions, then add the 
garlic, thyme and bay leaf, all chopped 
very fine, and season with salt, Cayenne 
and black pepper to taste. When the 
whole is browning nicely add a table- 
spoonful of'flour and water, or left-over 
broth, sufficient to cover. Season this 
to taste, and then take two pickles, about 
one finger long, slice very fine and add. 
Let all boil about fifteen minutes, and 
then lay the cold bouilli, which has been 
thickly sliced, in a sauce. Set it to bake 
in the oven about twenty minutes. Gar- 
nisli with buttered toast and serve hot.

CHAPTER VII. 
CBEOI^E GUMBO. 

Goxnbo a. la Creole. 



Gumbo, of all other products of the 
New Orleans cuisine, represents a most 
distinctive type of the evolutiooi of good 
cookery under the hands of the famous 
Creole cuisinieres of old New Orleans. 
Indeed, the word "evolution" fails to ap- 
ply when speaking of Gumbo, for it is an 
original conception, a something suigen 
eris in cooking, peculiar to this ancient 
Creole city alone, and to the manor born. 
With equal ability the olden Creole cooks 
saw the possibilities of exquisite and de- 
licious combinations in making Gumbo, 
and hence we have many varieties, till 
the occult science of making a good 
"Gombo a la Creole" seems too fine an 
inheritance of gastronomic lore to remain 
forever hidden away in the cuisines ot 
this old Southern metroipolis. The fol- 
lowing recipes, gathered with care from 
the best Creole housekeepers of New Or- 
leans, have been handed down from gen- 
eration to generation. They need only to 
be tried to prove their perfect claim to 
the admiration of the many distinguished 
visitors and epicures who have paid trib- 
ute to our Creole Gumbo. 

Gumbo File, 

First, it will be necessary to explain 
here, for the benefit of many, that "File" 
is a powder manufactured by the re- 
maining tribe of Choctaw Indians in 
Louisiana, from the young and tender 
leaves of the sassafras. The Indian 
squaws gather the leaves and spread 
them out on a stone mortar to dry. 
When thoroughly dried, they pound them 
into a fine powder, pass them through 
a hair sieve, and then bring the File to 
New Orleans to sell, coining twice a week 
to the French Market, from the old res- 
ervation set aside for their home on 
Bayou Lacombe, near Mandeville, La. 
The Indians used sassafras leaves and 
the sassafras for many medicinal pur- 
poses, and still sell bunches of the dried 
roots in the French Market. The Creoles, 
quick to discover and apply, found the 
possibilities of the powdered sassafras, 
or "File," and originated the well-known 
dish, "Gumbo File." 

To make a good "Gumbo File," use 
the following ingredients: 

1 Large Tender Chicken. 

2 Large Slices or 1-2 Pound Lean Ham. 

2 Tablespoontuls of Butter or 1 of Lard. 

1 Bay Leaf. 3 Sprigs of Parsley. 

3 Dozen Oysters. 

1 Large Onion. 1 Sprig of Thyme. 

2 Quarts of Oyster Water. 
2 Quarts of Boiling Water. 

1 Half Pod of Red Pepper, Without the 

Seeds. 
Salt and Pepper and Cayenne to Taste. 
Clean and cut up the chicken as for 
a fricassee. Dredge with salt and blacit 
pepper, judging according to taste. Cut 
the ham into dice shapes and chop the 
onion, parsley and thyme very fine. Put 
the lard or butter into the soup kettle 
or deep stewing pot, and when hot, put 
in the ham and chicken. Cover closely 
and fry for about five or ten minutes. 
Then add the onion and parsley and 
thyme, stirring occasionally to prevent 
burning. When nicely browned add the 
boiling water and throw in the oyster 
stock, which has been thoroughly heated. 
Add the bay leaf chopped very fine, and 
the pepper pod, cut in two, and set the 
Gumbo back to simmer for about an hour 
longer. WTien nearly ready to serve din- 



ner, and while the Gumbo is boiling 
add the fresh oysters. Let the Gumbo 
remain on the stove for about three 
minutes longer, and then remove the pot 
from the fire. Have ready tie tureens, 
set in a "bainmarie," or hot water bath, 
for once the File is added the Gumbo 
must never be warmed over. Take two 
tablespoonfuls of the File and drop grad- 
ually into the pot of boiling hot Gumbo, 
stirring slowly to mix thoroughly; pour 
into the tureen, or tureens, if Uiere 
should be a second demand and serve 
with boiled rice. (See recipe.) The rice, 
it should be remarked, must be boiled so 
that the grains stand quite apart, and 
brought to the table in a separate dish, 
covered. Serve about two spoonfuls of 
rice to one plate of Gumbo. 

The above recipe is for a family of 
six. Increased quantities in proportion 
as required. Never boil the Gumbo with 
the rice, and never add the File while the 
Gumbo is on the fire, as boiling after 
the File is added tends to make the 
Gumbo stringy and unfit for use, else 
the File is precipitated to the bottom of 
the pot, which is equally to be avoided. 

Where families cannot afford a fowl, 
a good Gumbo may be made by substi- 
tuting the round of the beef tor the 
chicken. 

Turkey Gnmbo. 

Gombo de Dinde. 

The Remains of a Turkey. 

1-2 Pound of Lean Ham. 

2 Tablespoons of Butter or 1 of Lard. 

1 Bay Leaf. 3 Sprigs of Parsley. 

3 Dozen Oysters. 

1 Large Onion. 1 S'prig of Thyme. 

2 Quarts of Oyster Water. 

1-2 Pod of Red Pepper, W^ithout the 

Seeds. 

Salt, Pepper and Cayenne to Taste. 

Nothing is ever lost In a well-regulated 
Creole kitchen. When turkey is served 
one day, the remains or "left-over" are 
saved and made into that most excellent 
dish — a Turkey Gumbo. It is made In 
the same manner as Chicken Gumbo, 
only instead of the chicken, the turkey 
meat, black and white, that is left over, 
is stripped from the bones and carcass. 
Chop fine and add to the hot lard, and 
then put in the ham, cut fine into dies 
shapes. Proceed exactly as in the recipe 
above, only after adding the boiling wa- 
ter, throw in the bones and carcass of 
the turkey. At the proper time remove 
the carcass and bones, add the oysters, 
and then remove the pot and "File" the 
Gumbo. Serve with boiled rice. Turkev 
Gumbo, when made from the remains of 
wild turkey, has a delicious flavor. 
Squirrel or Babbit Gumbo, 
Gombo d'Ecureil ou de Lapin. 

These are famous Creole Gumbos. The 
following ingredients are used: 

1 Fine Squirrel or Rabbit. 

2 Slices or 1-2 Pound of Lean Ham. 

3 Sprigs of Parsley. 1 Sprig of Thyme. 

1 Bay Leaf. 1 Large Onion. 

3 Dozen Oysters. 

, „ „ ^ Quarts of Oyster Water. 

1-2 Pod of Red Pepper, Without the Seed 

A Dash of Cayenne. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

Skin, clean and cut up the squirrel or 

rabbit, as for a frlcasse. Dredge well 

with salt and black pepper. Cut the ham 



19 



into dice shapes, and chop the onion, 
parsley and thyme very fine. Put the 
lard or butter into a deep stew pot and, 
when hot, put in the squirrel or rabbit. 
Cover closely and fry for about eight or 
ten minutes. Then proceed in exactly 
the same manner as for Chicken Gumbo; 
add the "File" at the time indicated, and 
serve with boiled Louisiana rice. (Se^ 
recipe.) 

Okra Gumbo. 

Gombo Fevi. 

1 Chicken. 1 Onion. 
6 Large Fresh Tomatoes. 

2 Pints of Okra, or Fifty Counted. 

1-2 Pod of Red Pepper, Without the 

Seeds. 

2 Lar^e Slices of Ham. 

1 Bay Leaf. 1 Sprig of Thyme or Parsley. 

1 Tablespoonful of Lard or Two Level 

Spoons of Butter. 

Salt and Cayenne to Taste. 

Clean and cut up the chicken. Cut 
the ham into small squares or dice and 
chop the onions, parsley and thyme. Skin 
the tomatoes, and chop fine, saving the 
juice. Wash and stem the okras and 
slice into thin layers of one-half inch 
each. Put the lard or butter into the 
soup kettle, and when hot add the chick- 
en and the ham. Cover closely and let 
it simmer for about ten minutes. Then 
add the chopped onions, parsley, thyme 
and tomatoes, stirring frequently to pre- 
vent scorching. Then add the okras, 
and, when well-browned, add the juice 
of the tomatoes, which imparts a su- 
perior flavor. The okra is very delicate 
and is liable to scorch quickly if not 
stirred frequently. For this reason many 
Creole cooks fry the okra separately 
in a frying pan, seasoning with the pep- 
per, Cayenne and salt, and then add to 
the chicken. But equally good results 
may be obtained with, less trouble by 
simply adding the okra to the frying 
chicken, and watching constantly to pre- 
vent scorching. The least taste of a 
"scorch" spoils the flavor of the gumbo. 
When well fried and browned, add to 
the boiling water tabout three quarts) 
and set on the back of the stove, 
letting it simmer gently for about an 
hour longer. Serve hot, with nicely 
boiled rice. The remains of turkey may 
be utilized -^ in the gumbo, instead of us- 
ing chicken. 

In families where it is not possible to 
procure a fow^l, use a round steak of 
beef or veal, instead of the chicken, and 
chop fine. But it must always be borne 
In mind that the Chicken Gumbo has the 
best flavor. Much, however, depends 
upon the seasoning, which is always 
high, and thus cooked, the Meat Gumbo 
makes a most nutritious and excellent 
dish. 

Crab Gumbo. 
Gombo aux Crabes. 

1 Dozen Hard-Shell or Soft-Shell Crabs. 
1 Onion. 
6 Large Fresh Tomatoes. 
2 Pints of Okra, or Fifty Counted. 
Seeds. 
1 Bay Leaf. 1 Sprig of Thyme or Parsley. 
1 Tablespoonful of Lard or Two Level 
Spoons of Butter. 
Salt and Cayenne to Taste. 
This is a great fast-day or "maigre" 
dish with the Creoles. Hard or soft- 
shell crabs may be used, though more 
frequently the former, as they are al- 
ways procurable and far cheaper than 
the latter article, which is considered 
a luxury. Crabs are always sold alive. 
Scald the hard-shell crabs and clean 



according to recipe already given, "tak- 
ing off the dead man's fingers" and the 
spongy substances, and being careful to 
see that the sandbags on the under part 
are removed. Then cut off the claws, 
crack and cut the body of the crab in 
quarters. Season nicely with salt and 
pepper. Put the lard into the pot, and 
when hot throw in the bodies and claws. 
Cover closely, and, after five or ten 
minutes, add the skinned tomatoes, 
chopped onions, thyme and parsley, stir- 
ring occasionally to prevent scorching. 
After five minutes add the okras, sliced 
fine, and when well-browned, without 
the semblance of scorching, add the bay 
leaf, chopped fine, and the juice of the 
tomatoes. Pour over about two quarts 
and a half of boiling water, and set back 
on the stove and let it simmer well for 
about an hour, having thrown in the 
pepper pod. When nearly ready to serve, 
season according to taste with Cayenne 
and added salt; pour into a tureen and 
serve with boiled rice. This quantity 
will allow two soft-shell crabs or two 
bodies of hard-shell crabs to each per- 
®^^ Oyster Gumbo. 

Gombo aux Huitres. 
4 Dozen Oysters. 
2 Quarts of Oyster Liquor. 
1 Teaspoonful of Lard or Butter. 
1 Quart of Hot Water. 
2 Tablespoonfuls of Flour. 
1 Large White Onion. 
Parsley, Thyme and Bay Leaf. 
Salt and Pepper to Taste. 
Put the lard into a kettle, and when 
hot add the flour, making a brown 
roux. When quite brown without burn- 
ing, add the chopped onions and pars- 
ley. Fry these, and when brown, add 
the chopped bay leaf; pour in the hot 
oyster liquor and then add the hot 
water. ,When it comes to a good boil, 
just before serving, add the oysters 
which have been well drained, without 
pouring water over them, however. Cook 
for about three minutes longer and take 
off the stove and stir gradually two 
tablespoonfuls of File into the boiling 
hot gumbo. Have the tureen ready in 
a "bain-marie," or hot water bath, and 
pour in the gumbo and cover. Bring 
to the table immediately and serve with 
boiled rice, allowing about six or eight 
oysters to each person. 

Shrimp Gum^bo. 
Gombo aux Chevrettes. 
Lake shrimp are always used in mak- 
ing this gumbo, the river shrimp being 
too small and delicate. Purchase always 
about 100 shrimp, or a small basketful, 
for there are always smaller shrimp In 
the pile which, when cooked, amount to 
little or nothing. In making Shrimp 
Gumbo, either "Fille" or Okra may be used 
in the combination, but it must be borne 
in mind that, while the "File" is fre- 
quently used, shrimp are far more deli- 
cious for gumbo purposes when used 
with okra. The shrimp should always 
be scalded or boiled before putting in 
the gumbo. (See recipe for "Boiling 
Shrimp.") 

Shrimp Gumbo File, 
Gombo, File aux Chevrettes. 

50 Fine Lake Shrimp. 

2 Quarts of Oyster Liquor. 

1 Quart of Hot Water. 

1 Large White Onion-. 1 Bay Leaf. 

3 Sprigs of Parsley. 1 Sprig of Thyme. 

1 Tablespoonful of Lard or Butter. 

1 Tablespoonful of Flour. 

Dash of Cayenne. 

Salt and Black Pepper to Taste. 



20 



Scald and shell the shrimp, seasoning^ 
highly with the boiling water. Put 
the lard into a kettle, and, when hot, 
add the flour, making a brown roux. 
When quite brown, without a semblance 
of burning, add the chopped onion and 
the parsley. Fry these, and when brown, 
add the chopped bay leaf; pour in the 
hot oyster liquor and the hot water, or 
use the carefully strained liquor in which 
the shrimp have been boiled. When 
it comes to a good boil, and about five 
minutes before serving, add the shrimp 
to the gumbo and take off the stove. 
Then add to the boiling hot liquid about 
two tablespoonfuls of the "File," thick- 
ening according to taste. Season again 
witn salt and pepper to tasie. Serve im- 
mediately with boiled rice. (See recipe, 
"Boiled Rice.") 

Green or Herb Gumbo. 
Gomho aux Herbes. 
A Veal Brisket. 
1 Large Slice of Lean Ham. 
Equal Parts of the Leaves of Young 
Cabbage, Radish, Turnips, Mustard, 
Spinach, Watercress, Parsley and 
Green Onion. 
1 Large Red or WTiite Onion. 
1-2 Red Pepper Pod. 
1 Bay Leaf. 1 Sprig of Thyme. 

1 Sprig of Sweet Marjoram. 
1 Clove. 9 Allspice. 

Cayenne to Taste. 
Soak and wash the leaves thoroughly, 
being careful to wash each leaf sep- 
arately, to be sure there lurk no in- 
sects in the folds or ridges. Then trim 
by taking off all the coarse midrib of 
the leaves, which will make the gumbo 
taste coarse and unpalatable. Boil the 
leaves together for about two hours and 
then parboil by adding a teaspoonful ol 
cooking soda. Strain and chop very 
fine, being careful to save the .water in 
which they were boiled. Cut the brisket 
of veal and the sliced ham into small 
pieces and dredge with black pepper and 
salt, and chop one large white or red on- 
ion. Put a heaping teaspoonful of lard 
into a deep frying pan, and, when hot, 
add the chopped veal and the ham. Cover 
and let it simmer for about ten minutes, 
stirring occasionally to prevent burning. 
Then add the chopped onion and a little 
sprig of parsley chopped fine. When it 
comes to a rich brown, add the greens. 



and when these are ^''O'^^f'^- Pe^iu'*}'^^ 
four quarts of the water in which the 
leaves have been boiled. Throw m the 
finely chopped bay leaf, thyme, sweet 
marjoram and the red pepper pod and 
the clove and allspice, mashed fine. Set 
it hack on the stove and let it boil for 
about one hour longer, adding the Cay- 
enne or "hot pepper," and you will have 
a regular Creole gumbo peculiar to New 
Orleans alone. Serve with boiled nee. 
Cabbage Gumbo. 
Gombo Choux. 
1 Large Head of Cabbage (green and 
white mixed). 
1 Round Steak. 
2 Large Slices of Lean Ham. 
2 Pounds of Creole Sausage. 
(About 6 to a Pound). 
1 Pod of Cayenne Pepper, W^ithout the 

Seeds. 

1 Pint of Milk. 1 Tablespoonful of Lard. 

Salt and Black Pepper and Cayenne to 

Taste. 

Shred the cabbage and wash each leaf 
separately and thoroughly to avoid in- 
sects. Then chop the entire head ver>' 
fine, into pieces about half the size of 
dice. Cut the steak or brisket into small 
squares, also the ham, and fry in the 
deepest kettle you have, putting the meat 
into the pot when the lard is very hot. 
When it begins to brown, add a chopped 
onion and the sausage, and then add the 
chopped cabbage, stirring and pouring 
in enough water to prevent it from burn- 
ing. Throw in the red pepper pod and 
a dash of Cayenne, and salt to taste. 
Add a litle black pepper. Stir often and 
allow the ingredients to cook well, grad- 
ually adding, if necessary, a little wa- 
ter, and stirring frequently to prevent 
burning. When thoroughly cooked, make 
a cream sauce as follows: 

Take one pint of new milk and two 
tablespoonfuls of flour and mix thor- 
oughly, so as not to be lumpy. Stir this 
into the gumbo while boiling, and con- 
tinue stirring for five minutes. Serve 
with boiled rice. If it is not possible 
to procure milk, almost the same effect 
may be attained by mixing the flour in 
cold water of the same measurement and 
stirring in as already given. The gumbo 
must not be allowed to stand on the fire 
after the flour has been boiled on it for 
five minutes, as it will burn. 



CHAPTER VIII. 
FISH 

Du Poisson. 



The perfectio'n and variety of the fish 
found in the New Orleans market are 
unsurpassed. AVe have here all the fish 
found in the waters of the Gulf of Mex- 
ico contiguous to New Orleans, the Mis- 
siissippi Sound and our own lake shores. 
These constitute the famous salt-water 
varieties, such as the Sheepshead, con- 
sidered by many the best fish in the 
Gulf; the famous Pompano and Spanish 
Mackerel, the dainty Croaker, the tooth- 
some Flounder, the Bluefish, the Silver 
Trout, Tenderloin Trout, Speckled Trout 
and the Grouper. Among shell fish we 
have the Hard-Shell Crab, the Soft-Sh-^U 
Crab, considered a great luxury In other 
parts, but always to be found in the 
New Orleans market; the appetizing 
Lake Shrimp; that delicicus bivalve, the 
Oyster; the Crawfish, and the famous 
Green Turtle, so highly prized as a 
dainty morsel. Again, in the rivers and 
bayous and small streams of Louisiana 



we have many delightful varieties of 
fresh-water fish, such as fresh-water or 
Green Trout, the Sacalait and a coarse 
fish called the Buffalo. The River 
Shrimp of Louisiana are unique in the 
United States. They are cf a far more 
delicate variety than the Lake Shrimp 
and much prized as an article of food. 
Both Lake and River Shrimp are abun- 
dant in the summer time and are used 
alike by rich and poor. 

In the following recipes the most de- 
lightful methods of preparing these fish 
are given, methods which may be used 
by all according to the purse, the co-n- 
ditions of the poorest having been con- 
sidered as well as the wants of the 
wealthy. All are equally recommended, 
being the most perfect preparations of 
their kind in use among the Creole 
housekeepers. It might be added hers, 
for the benefit of any Northern house- 
keepers into whose hands this book may 



21 



fall, that many of the recipes may be 
modified according to good judgment in 
preparing the fish found exclusively in 
the Northern markets. For instance, in 
making the famous "Courtbouillon," 
which is in all respects a distinctive 
Creole conception, any firm fish, such 
as the Bass, may be used, though, of 
course, the flavor of the aelicious Red 
Snapper or Red Fish used by the Creoles 
to the exclusion of all other fish in mak- 
ing a "Courtbouillon," will be found 
wanting. With modificatio-ns that wi?] 
suggest themselves to any intelligent 
housekeeper, they may be used the world 
over in preparing fish of other varieties 
than those which are the delight and 
pride of the New Orleans J?!isn Market. 

How to Tell Good Fish. 

Unless perfectly fresh, fish is unfit for 
use. Care should be taken to see that 
the gills . are bright and red, the scales 
shining, the eyes clear and the flesh very 
firm and free from any unpleasant odor. 
In the New Orleans Fish Market the ver- 
dors generally clean and scale the fish, 
if requested to do so; but this cleaning 
and scaling is not to be entirely depend- 
ed upon, because it is rarely thorough, 
only the heavier scales and entrails be- 
ing removed. On coming home from the 
market, the fish should be Inmaediately 
rescaled and thoroughly cleansed and 
washed without soaking in water; it is 
far better to let the water run over the 
fish, for thus the smallest particle of 
blood is removed. This is very impor- 
tant in order to have a good, wholesome, 
savory dish. Then sprinkle the fish on 
the inside with salt, and set in the ice 
box. If this is wanting, put it in a very 
cool place, but it is always best for it 
to remain on ice until ready to use, es- 
pecially during the summer. 

Methods of Cooking Fish. 

Visitors to New Orleans declare that 
nowhere is fish cooked in such palatable 
ways as in this old Franco-Spanish city. 
The experience of generations of fine old 
cooks has been brought to bear upon the 
preparation of the fish found in the Lou- 
isiana waters, and those of the Mexican 
Gulf, with the result that a Creole code 
of rules tor the cooking of even the 
smallest and less important fish prevails, 
and it is considered little short of bar- 
barous to depart from it. 

The Creole methods of boiling and 
baking fish are the perfection of culinary 
art and unlike any methed in vogue else- 
where. 

Special recipes are, therefore, given for 
the boiling and baking of S'heepshead. 
Redfish, Red Snapper, as, also, for mak- 
ing the world-famous Creole "Co'urt- 
bouillon" and "Bouillabaise." These rules 
should be strictly observed in cooking 
these fish if one would bring out the 
best flavor of each. But there are other 
fish, such as Green Trout and Perch 
which, when simply boiled and served 
with appropriate sauces, are known to 
reserve their best flavor for this species 
of cooking. 

The following general rules for boilmg 
broiling, baking, stewing and trying fish 
shoulud be carefully followed wherever 
Indicated in the recipes. 

BOILED FISH. 

Poisson Bouilli. 

General Rules for Boiling Fish. 

Clean and wash the fish thoroughly. 
Make a small letter "S" with knife on 



the ■back; pass twine around the body of 
the fish so as to secure it. Never wrap 
or tie in a cloth. Have ready a kettle 
of boiling water and throw in a sprig of 
onion, thyme and bay leaf, eight or ten 
cloves, about two dozen allspice, all- 
mashed tine; a bit of lemon peel and a 
red pepper pod. When the water has 
boiled long enough to have extracted the 
flavor of these ingredients, drop the fish 
in carefully, so as to avoid breaking. Let 
it boil about ten minutes and then take 
out carefully. Put into a strainer and 
drain quickly. Place on a bed of parsley 
with garnishes of lemon and serve either 
a Mayonnaise or Genoise Sause or Sauc-2 
Hollandaise. (See recipes.) 

The Creoles add a clove of garlic to 
the boiling water, but this is according 
to taste. 

BKOILED FISH. 

Poisson Grille. 
General Bules for Broiling Fish. 

Always use the double broiler, made 
of wire, as this allows the coo'k to tuin 
the fish from side to side without dis ■ 
turbing the body during the process of 
broiling, and possibly breaking the flesh 
Clean the fish, without cutting off tho 
head and tail. When the fish is large 
split down the back; else broil whole. 
Always serve broiled fish whole. 'Have 
a clear moderate fire. Expose first the 
flesh side to the fire, and then the skin, 
as the latter browns it is liajble to burn 
quickly. Great care must, therefore, be 
taken not to burn the skin side. 

Before placing on the broiler, rub the 
fish well with salt and pepper, mixed In 
a little sweet oil or a little butter oil or 
butter. If the fish is small, broil on a 
quick, clear fire; if large, as mentioned 
above, the fire must be moderate, or the 
outside of the fish will be charred before 
the inside is done. When the fish is done 
through and through, which can quickly 
be determined by the fish parting easily 
from the bone, remove the gridiron from 
the fire, and loosen the fms from the 
broiler with a knife, being careful not (o 
break the flesh. Then place the hot dish 
over the fish, and, with a dexterous 
movement, turn the two back again, thus 
separating the gridiron from the fish and 
placing the latter in the dish. Butter 
well, seasoned with a little pepper and 
salt, it deemed necessary, and pour over 
a tablespoonful of chopped parsley and 
lemon juice. Serve with garnishes of 
sliced lemon and parsley, or garnishes 
of delicate green lettuce leaves. 
BAKFD FISH. 
Poisson au Gratin. 
General Rules for Baking Fish. 

Clean the fish, cutting off the fins. 
Make the letter "S" on the sides. Rub 
well inside and out with pepper and salt. 
Butter a stewpan and put In one large 
chopped onion ahd a wineglassful of 
white wine. Place the fish in the pan, 
put in the oven and let it bake about 
twenty minutes, having been careful to 
place lumps of butter over it and bast- 
ing frequently. When done carefully, 
lift the fish out of the pan and put it 
into the dish in which it is to be 
served. Take the gravy in which the 
fish has been cooked and add about a 
cup of oyster water, the juice of one 
lemon, two tablespoontuls of chopped 
mushrooms, one tablespoonful of minced 
parsley, thyme and sweet marjoram, ten 
allspice, one clove of garlic, a little Cay- 
enne, and salt and pepper to taste. Mix 
all thoroughly over the stove, adding a 



22 



little butter if the gravy adheres too 
much to the pan. Pour o-ver the fish, 
and garnish with whole mushrooms and 
slices of lemon laid alternately upon 
Croutons or dried toast, cut diamond 
shape. 

STEWED FISH. 
Poisson en Matelote. 
General Rules for Stewing: Fish. 
Clean the fish well and slice and pour 
over one cup of good, boiling vinegar. 
Make a roux by putting one tablespoon- 
ful of lard into the stewpan, and when 
hot add gradually two tablespoonfuls of 
flour rubbed smoothly. When quite 
brown, take the fish, which has been 
previously rubbed with salt and pepper, 
and place in the pot. Let it sim- 
mer gently a few minutes, and 
then add a large chopped onion, 
parsley, one clove of garlic, one sprig of 
thyme, a bay leaf, two blades of mace 
and eight or ten allspice. Let . these 
brown and cover with water sufficient 
to prevent burning. Put the fish on a 
slow fire to stew, and when half done, 
add a little Cayenne, and, if possible, 
add a pint or glass of Port wine. When 
done, place the fish in a dish, pour the 
gravy over it, and garnish with Crou- 
tons, with alternate slices of lemon and 
prepared horseradish. 

FRIED FISH. 

Poissons Frits. 
General Rules for Frying Fish. 

Certain of the fish of the Mexican 
Gulf are always best when fried. Of 
these are the toothsome Croakers, the 
delicate Sacalait and Patassas, and also 
the Speckled Trout when served in ten- 
derloin steaks. 

The secret of good frying lies in hav- 
ing the lard heated just to the prO'per 
point. If the fish is placed in the boil- 
ing lard. It is liable to burn quickly with- 
out being cooked through and through. 
If placed simply in the well-heated lard. 
It absorbs the fat and is delicate and 
tender and there is no tax upon the di- 
gestive organs. Always have sufficient 
lard in the pan to fry all the fish that is 
on hand, and never add a lump of cold 
lard to the heated substance. This 
checks the cooking of the fish and spoils 
the taste. If the lard spits and crackles, 
that is no evidence of boiling. It only 
means that the lard is throwing off drops 
of moisture that have crept in. Boiling 
lard is perfectly still until it begins t^ 
smoke, and then it is in danger of burn- 
ing and must be removed from the fire. 
To test the lard, drop In a piece of bread. 
If It begins to color, the lard Is ready for 
frying. W^hen the fish is fried, skim 
It out, draining off all the fat. Butter is 
never used in frying fish, as it burns 
quickly. 

A Short Resume of the Way in Which 

Fish of the New Orleans Market 

Should Always Be Cooked. 

Sheepshead may be boiled, broiled or 
baked, and is good with any sauce. 

Redflsh is principally used in making 
"Courtboulllon," or It Is boiled and 
served with an HoUandaise Sauce, or 
baked. 

Red Snapper should always be bollea 
or baked. It is delightful served a la 
Chambard, but It Is best a la Creole. 

Grouper Is served In the same way 
as Red Snapper. 

Flounder should always be baked a la 
Nouvelle Orleans, or a la Normande, 



or with a white wine sauce as in Baked 
Sheepshead, or in the famous recipe 
"Sole a la Orly." (See recipe ) 

Pompano should always be broiled and 
served with Sauce a la Maitre d Hotel. 

Spanish Mackerel should always be 
broiled in the same manner as Pompano, 
and served with Sauce a la Maitre 
d'lHotel. , , 

Bluefish should be cooked and served 
in the same manner as Pompano and 
Spanish Mackerel. 

Speckled Trout is generally broiled and 
served in tenderloin, or a Tenderloin 
Trout, with Sauce a la Tartare. 

Green Trout and Perch should be 
broiled and served with a Sauce a la 
Maitre d'Hotel, or else boiled and served 
with a Sauce Genoise, or an HoUandaisa 
or Drawn Butter Sauce. 

Croakers are fried and served with 
garnish of parsley or lemon. 

Patassas, Sacalait and other small fish 
are served in the same manner as Croak- 
ers. 

Soft-Shell Crabs may be fried in th« 
same manner as Croakers, or broiled and 
served on toast. 

Shrimp are generally boiled, witQ 
plenty of seasoning. The River Shrimp 
are always served as boiled, shells and 
all, but the Lake Shrimp enter into many 
combinations in cooking. 

Hard-Shell Crabs may be stuffed, 
stewed, fried and ntade into Gumbo. 

All left-over broiled, baked or boiled 
fish should be utilized in making salads, 
croquettes, etc. 

Oysters are served in almost every 
conceivable way, and enter into the most 
delightful combinations in cooking. 

A fish weighing three pounds, or smail 
fish in quantity sufficient to make three 
pounds (uncooked) will serve six per- 
sons. 

THE SHEEPSHEAD. 

Casburgot. 

Of all the fish found in the waters of 
the Gulf of Mexico, the Sheepshead i» 
perhaps the most to be commended for 
frequent household use, being susceptible 
of a far greater variety of modes of prep- 
aration than any other fish, the flesh 
being of a less richer fiber than the Red- 
fish, Red Snapper, Pompano and Spanish 
Mackerel, it may be used from day to 
day without injury to the stomach. It is 
good in almost any form and may be 
boiled, baked or broiled, and served with 
almost any sauce. 

Boiled Sheepshead. 

Casburgot Bouilli. 

A 3-Pound Sheepshead. 1 Sliced Onion. 
3 Bay Leaves. 1 Sprig of Thyme. 1 

Sprig of Parsley. 
1 Sprig of Sweet Marjoram. 1 Table- 
spoonful of French Vinegar. 
Salt and Pepper to Taste. 
A Cream Sauce. 

^Vash and thoroughly clean the fish, 
and then lay on a pan and open the 
flesh on either side bv making the letter 
"S" with the knife. This is done to pre- 
vent the fish from puffing out or draw- 
ing up, and to insure thorough cooking 
and a perfect shape afterwards. Then 
tie the fish well with cord or twine, 
wrapping It around the body. Nevsr 
encase a boiled fish In a cloth; put the 
fish in a deep saucepan and add boiling 
water sufficient for the fish to swim in 
it. Throw In a tablespoonful of spice 
(well mashed), a sliced onion, three bay 
leaves, a sprig of parsley (all chopped 
very fine), a tablespoonful of French 



23 



vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste. 
Cover well and let it boil for ten min- 
utes. After ten minutes, ttie fish In 
cooked. Prepare a "Cream Sauce" (soo 
recipe) and serve immediately. 

Sheepshead u la Creole. 

Casburgot a la Creole. 

A 3-Pound Sheepshead. 
2 Onions. 1 Bunch of Parsley. 

2 Sprigs of Thyme. 4 Bay Leaves. 1 

Sprig of Sweet Marjoram. 

1 Quart of Boiled Cream. Tolks of 1 

Eggs. 

3 Tablespoonfuls of Flour. 2 Tablo- 

spoonfuls of Butter. 
Bread Crumbs. 
Prepare the Sheepshead as for boiling 
(see recipe Boiled Sheepshead). When 
quite done, take out of the water and 
flake off ail the flesh from the bones. 
Have ready a quart of boiled cream 
or milk. Beat the yolks of four eggs and 
mix -with the cream. Chop one large 
onion, a bunch of parsley, a sprig each 
of thyme and bay leaf, and add to the 
cream and eggs. Let it boil up once, and 
while boiling, throw in three tablespoon- 
fuls of flour, rubbed perfectly smooth, 
in a little cream, and about two table- 
spoonfuls of butter. Remove from the 
fire. Have ready a deep dish, well but- 
tered, and put in a layer of fish and 
then a layer of the sauce, until the dish 
is full. Sprinkle over with bread crumbs. 
Place in the oven and bake about a half 
hour, or until bro"wn. 

Baked Sheepshead. 

Casburgot au Gratin. 

A 3-Pound Sheepshead. 1 Large Onion. 

2 Tablespoonfuls of Flour. 

2 Tablespoonfuls of Butter. 1 Bay Leaf. 
1 Sprig of Thyme. 1-2 Bottle of White 

"Wine. 
6 Fresh Tomatoes. 2 Dozen Lake Shrimp. 

1 Dozen Oysters. 1-2 Can of Mushrooms. 

2 Crackers. Dry Toast Cut in Dice Shape. 
3 S'prigs Chopped Parsley to Garnish. 

Clean and wash the fish; place on a 
platter: chop one large onion fine, rub 
the fish first with salt and black pepper, 
and then take a large and deep kitchen 
pan; place within a tablespoonful of but- 
ter, the chopped onion, bay "leaf and 
thyme. Place the fish on top of this and 
pour over a half bottle of white wine. 
Cover with another close pan and put 
the whole on top of the oven (not on the 
inside). Bake from the bottom". When 
it begins to boil from below, turn the 
fish over carefully without breaking, and 
let it bake on the other side. Take a 
saucepan and put within a tablespoonful 
of butter and mix thoroughly with two 
tablespoonfuls of flour. Let it brown 
without burning, and then add six fresh 
tomatoes, skinned and chopped fine, or a 
half can. Add two dozen Lake Shrimp 
that have been cleaned well and scalded, 
a half can of mushrooms, salt and pepper 
to taste. Let all cook for about five 
minutes and then water with the gravj' 
in which the fish is cooking. Mix well 
and cover the fish with it. Parboil one 
dozen oysters, and when the fish is 
cooked set it in the dish in which it is 
to be served and place the oysters all 
around it on small slices of dry toast. 
Cover the fish alternately with th? 
shrimp and oysters, as a garnish over 
and around it. Mash two crackers into 
crumbs and sprinkle over, and place al- 
ternately small bits of butter on top of 
the fish. Place the dish in the oven and 
bake the fish with a quick fire until 
brown, and serve immediately. 



Baked Sheepshead a la Creole, 

Casburgot a la Creole au Gratin. 

A 3-Pound Sheepshead. 

1 Cup of Stale Bread Crumbs. 

1 Onion. 1 Tablespoonful of Chopped 

Parsley. 

1 Tablespoonful of Melted Butter. 

1 Tablespoonful of Lard. 1 Pint of 

White Wine or Boiling Water. 

Salt and Pepper and Flour to Dredge. 

A Hollandaise, Bechamel or Tomato 

Sauce. 

The folio-wing is a more simple man- 
ner, where means are limited, of baking 
Sheepshead for frequent family use; 
Clean the fish thoroughly, inside and 
out; wash well and dry thoroughly with 
a clean towel. Rub it well with salt and 
pepper, then make a dressing, taking one 
cup of stale bread crumbs, wet and 
squeezed thoroughly of all water, one 
tablespoonful of melted butter, one table- 
spoonful of chopper parsley, a half tea- 
spoonful of salt and a little black i>epper. 
Mix well and fry in a little lard. One 
dozen oysters or shrimp, or the yolks of 
two hard-boiled eggs added and mixed 
increase the flavor of the dressing, but 
the dressing can be made very nicely 
without. After frying the dressing a few 
minutes take off the stove and stuff the 
body of the fish and sew up with soft 
thread on soft yarn. Score or slit the fish 
on either side, making the scores about 
an inch apart, and lard it either by put- 
ting a strip of salt fat in each gash or 
filling with lard. Grease the bottom of 
a baking pan, put the fish In and dredge 
thickly with salt and flour and a little 
Cayenne. If possible, pour over a half 
bottle of white wine, otherwise simply 
cover the bottom of the pan with the 
grease, add a little boiling water, and 
put the fish in a hot oven. Baste every 
ten minutes or so by taking a spoon and 
pouring the gravy over the fish. Allow 
about 'fifteen minutes of baking to every 
pound of fish, the ordinary sized fish of 
four pounds requiring about one hour. 
When brown on one side, turn on the 
other, and when done carefully slide the 
fish into the center of the flat dish In 
which it is to be served, and garnish 
nicely with slices of lemon, fried potato 
'balls and chopped parsley. Make -tha 
garnish by placing sprigs of parsley be- 
tween the fried potato balls and laying 
on tlie slices of lemon. Serve "with Hol- 
landaise Sauce or Bechamel Sauce. (Sea 
recipes.) 

Again, where the fish is not baked in 
wine and served with separate sauce a 
good sauce from its own juices may be 
made. Simply grease and cover the bot- 
tom of the pan with boiling water and 
place in the fish. As it begins to bake 
well take a half dO'zen good fresh toma- 
toes or a half can of tomatoes, one 
onion, one bay leaf, a sprig of thyme 
and a blade of mace, chop all fine, and 
mix thoroughly and pour over the baK- 
ing fish. Add a little butter, salt and 
pepper, and a very good every-day sauce 
■will be the result. 



BED SNAPPBB AND EBDFISH. 

Red Snapper et Poisson Rouge. 

These are distinctive fish, and form 
unique and most delightful dishes of th* 
Creole cuisine. 



24 



Courtbouillon a la Creole. 

Six Fine Slices of Redfish or Red Snap- 
per (equal to 3 Pounds.) 
1 Tablespoontul of Lard. 2 Tablespoon- 

fuls of Flour. 

12 Well-Mashed Allspice. 3 S'prigs of 

Thyme. 

3 Sprigs Parsley. 3 Sprigs Sweet 

Marjoram. 3 Bay Leaves. 

1 Large Onion. 1 Clove of Garlic. 

6 Large Fresh Tomatoes or a Half Can. 

1 Quart of Water, 1 Glass of Claret. 

The Juice of 1 Lemon. 

Salt and Cayenne to Taste. 

Those kings of the New Orleans French 

Market, the Red Snapper or the Redfish, 

are used in making the pride and glory 

of the New Orleans cuisines, a good 

"Courtbouillon." More generally and 

with finer results the Redfish or Pois- 

son Rouge" is used. This fish may 

always be known by the single spot on 

the tail. ,. ,, 

To make a real Courtbouillon shoe the 
Redfish in fine, clear-cut pieces, after 
having thoroughly washed and cleaned 
it. Make a "Roux" by putting one 
tablespoonful of lard in a deep can or 
kettle. When hot add gradually two 
tablespoonfuls of flour, stirring con- 
stantly to prevent burning. Throw 
in about ten or twelve well-mashed all- 
spice, and three sprigs each of chopped 
thyme, parsley, bay leaf and sweet mar- 
joram, one clove of garlic and one large 
onion, chopped very fine. Add six 
fresh, large tomatoes, chopped fine, or 
one-half can of tomatoes. Pour in 
one glass of good claret, add about 
one quart of water, and let it boil well. 
Then add salt and Cayenne to taste, and 
when this has boiled about five minutes 
add the fish, putting in slice by slice. 
Add the juice of a lemon, and let all 
boil about ten minutes. Serve with 
French fried potatoes, mashed potatoes 
or potato croquettes. 

A Courtbouillon of Red Snappe" is 
made in the same way. 

Spanish Courtbonillon. 

Courtbouillon a I'Espagnole. 

6 Slices of Redfish or Red Snapper (Piual 

to 3 pounds). 
1 Tablespoonful of Lard. 2 Tablespoon- 
fuls of Flour. 
1 Large Onion, 6 Tomatoes, 3 Sprigs of 

Parsley. 

1 Clove of Garlic. 3 Sprigs of Thyme. 

1 Sprig of Sweet Basil. 

2 Bay Leaves. 1 Cup of White Wine. 

2 Pints of Water. 

The delightful adaptability of the 
New Orleans cuisine to the wants of all 
the people may be seen in the folio-w- 
ing Courtbouillon, which is in general 
use among the families of moderate 
means, and is, indeed, a very pleasing 
way of cooking Redfish: 

Take four to six slices of Redfish. 
Make a Roux by putting one tablespoon- 
ful of lard into the stew pan, and when 
It is hot, stir in gradually two table- 
spoonfuls of flour. Add one large 
chopped onion, six tomatoes (chopped), 
the chopped parsley, clove of garllo, 
sweet basil and thyme, all chopped very 
fine. Add two bay leaves whole. When 
it browns nicely without burning, pour 
In about two pints of water and let It 
come to a boil. Rub the fish well with 
salt and pepper, and pour over it a cup 
of boiling vinegar, if you have no white 
wine. Put the fish slice bv slice into 
the pot and let It simmer for about a 
half hour, or until the flesh begins to 



he soft Then remove from the fire, 
take out of the pot, and lay the slices 
in a msh. Take the bay leaves out of 
the gravy, pour the gravy over the fish, 
and serve with garnishes of sliced 

It is a most economical Friday or fast- 
day dish in large families when served 
with boiled rice, or potatoes boiled 
whole. 



BouillabalBse, 



6 Slices of 



6 Slices of Red Snapper. 
Redfish. 

1-2 Bottle of White Wine. 1-2 Lemon. 

6 Large Fresh Tomatoes, or 1-2 Can. 

3 Onions. I Herb Bouquet 

3 Cloves of Garlic. 

3 Bay I^eaves. 3 Sprigs of Thyme. 

3 Sprigs of Parsley. 

6 Allspice. 2 Tablespoonfuls of Olive Oil. 

1 Good Strong Pinch of Saffron. 

Salt, Pepper and Cayenne to Taste. 

This is the dish that drew from Thack- 
eray that famous tribute to Creole Cook- 
ery: "In New Orleans you can eat a 
Bouillabaisse, the like of which was nev- 
er eaten in Marseilles or Paris." 

The reason is clear, for in those old 
French cities the Bouillabaisse is made 
from the fish of the waters of the Medi- 
terranean sea, notably the Sturgeon and 
the Perch combined, while in New Or- 
leans it is made from those matchless 
fish of the Gulf of Mexico, the Red Snap- 
per and the Redfish (Poisson Rouge). It 
will be noticed that it takes two kinds 
of fish to make a Bouillabaisse. The 
first Bouillabaisse was made in Marseil- 
les, and the old Creole tradition runs 
that it was the discovery of two sailor 
fishermen, who were disputing as they 
sat in a schooner as to the proper way 
of cooking a Sturgeon and Perch com- 
bined. Both essayed: One succeeded 
in making a delightful dish that would 
have gladened the heart of any old 
French "bon vivant." The other failed. 
The successful one enthusiastically of- 
fered to teach his friend, and as the 
latter was following the directions im- 
plicitly, and the finishing touches 
were being given to the dish, the teach- 
er, seeing that the critical and Impor- 
tant mofnent had come when the fish 
must be taken from the fire, or It would 
be spoiled if it cooked a moment longer, 
cried out, bringing dowTi his hand em- 
phatically: "Et quand ca commence a 
bouillir — Baisse!" Hence the name 
"Bouillabaisse," which was given to 
the dish from that moment. From all 
portions of Europe people go to Marseil- 
les to eat a "Bouillabaisse" on the sea- 
shore. 

The Creole Bouillabaisse, with the 
modifications and improvements that 
early ingenuity suggested, Is a dish 
that was the standing offering In ante- 
bellum days to every distinguished Pari- 
sian or foreigner that visited New Or- 
leans. Its reputation Is sustained by 
the Creole cusinieres of our own day. It 
is made as follows: 

First cut off the head of the Red Snap- 
per and boil it In about one and a half 
quarts of water, so as to make a fish 
stock. Put one sliced onion and a herb 
bouquet consisting of thyme, bay leaf 
and parsley, into the water. When re- 
duced to one pint, take out the head ot 
the fish and the herb bouquet and strain 
the water and set it aside for use later 
on. 

Take six slices ot Redfish and six 
slices of Red Snapper of equal sizes and 



25 



rub well with salt and pepper. Mince 
three sprigs of thyme, three sprigs of 
parsley, three bay leaves and three cloves 
of garlic, very, very fine, and take six 
allspice and grind them very fine, and 
mix thoroughly with the minced herbs 
and garlic. Then take each slice of 
fish and rub well with this mixture till 
every portion is permeated by the herbs, 
spice and garlic. They must be, as it 
were, soaked into the flesh, if you would 
achieve the success of this dish. Take 
two tablespoonfuls of fine olive oil and 
put into a very large pan, so large that 
each slice of the Tish may he put in with- 
out one piece overlapping the other. Chop 
two onions very fine and add them to 
the heating oil . Lay the fish slice by 
slice in the pan and cover, and let them 
"etouffe," or smother for about ten min- 
utes, turning once over so that each side 
may cook partly. Then take the fish 
out of the pai. and set the slices in a 
dish. Pour a half bottle of white wine 
into the pan and stir well. Add a half 
can of tomatoes, or six large, fresh to- 
matoes sliced fine, and let them boil well. 
Then add half a lemon, cut in very thin 
slices, and pour over a pint of the liquor 
In which the head of the snapper was 
boiled. Season well to taste with salt, 
pepper and a dash of Cayenne. Let it 
boil until very strong and till reduced 
almost one half; then lay the fish slice 
-by slice, apart one from the other, in 
the pan, and let boil five minutes. In 
the meantime have prepared one good 
pinch of saffron, chopped very fine. Set 
it in a small deep, dish and add a lit- 
tle of the sauce in which the fish is 
boiling to dissolve well. When well 
melted, and when the fish has been just 
five minutes in the pan, spread the saf- 
fron over the top of the fish Take 
out of the pan, lay each slice on toast, 
which has been fried in butter; pour the 
sauce over and serve hot immediately. 
You will have a dish that Lucullus would 
have envied. 



Boiled Redfish or Boiled Bed Snapper. 

Poisson Rouge ou Red Snapper 
Bouilli. 

A 3-Pound Redfish or Red Snapper. 

1 Sliced Onion. 
3 Bay Leaves. 1 Sprig of Xhyme. 
3 Sprigs of Parsley. 
1 Sprig of Sweet Marjoram. 1 Table- 
spoonful of French Vinegar. 
Salt and Pepper to Taste. 
An Hollandaise Sauce. 

Wash and thoroughly clean the fish, 
and then lay on a pan and open the 
flesh on either side by making the let- 
ter "S" with the knife. This is done to 
prevent the fish from puffing out or 
drawing up. and to insure thorough 
cooking and a perfect shape afterwards. 
Then tie the fish well with cord or twine, 
wrapping it around the body. Never en- 
case a boiled fish in a cloth; put the 
fish in a deep saucepan and add boil- 
ing water sufficient for the fish to swim 
in it. Throw in a tablespoonful of spice 
(well 'mashed), a sliced onion, three bay 
leaves, a sprigr of thyme and sweet mar- 
joram, a sprig of parsley (all chopped 
very fine), a tablespoonful of French 
vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste. 
Cover well and let it boil for ten min- 
utes. After ten minutes, the fish is 
cooked. Prepare a "Cream Sauce" (See 
recipe), and serve immediately.

FLOUNDER. 
Sole. 
The Creoles gave to the Flounder, one 
of the finest fish found in the waters 
of the Mexican Gulf, the French name 
"Sole," because while the fish was some- 
what different in size and shape, they 
found that the meat of the Flounder was 
Identically the same as that of the "Sole" 
found in the waters of the Mediterranean 
sea. Quick to discover and appreciate, 
they applied to the Flounder the name 
"Sole," and adapted it to the French 
modes of cooking the latter fish, espe- 
cially applying to it the famous old 
French recipe "Sole a la Orly." Other- 
wise in New Orleans the Flounder is al- 
ways either fried and served with a 
sauce "a la Tartare," or baked "a la 
Nouvelle Orleans," or "a la Normande," 
or served with a white wine sauce as in 
Baked Sheepshead. (See recipe "Baked 
Sheepshead," or "Casburgot au Gratin.")

POMPANO. 

Pompano is the crowning glory of the 
fish of the New Orleans market. It i."! 
peculiar to the waters of the Gulf of 
Mexico, Mississippi Sotmd and the Louisi- 
ana Grand Isle shore. The word Pom- 
pano is derived from the Spanish "Pam- 
pano," signifying a peculiar greenish - 
tinted plant, and the name "Pompano ' 
was given to the fish by the early Span- 
ish fishermen on account of the deli- 
cate greenish color which distinguishes 
it. Nothing to be compared with the 
Pompano exists in the Northern, Eastern 
or "Western waters, and no stranger 
leaves New Orleans without having tast 
ed once of this delightful fish. The 
New Orleans Pompano has a world-wide 
fame. The Pompano used to come in the 
early spring and remain but a few 
weeks, hence the first fish that appeared 
in the French Market were eagerly 
sought after as a great luxury. Pom- 
pano are more plentiful now and are 
to be found in the market almost all 
the year round. 

Pompano a la Maitre d'Hotel. 

A Fine Pompano, or Small Ones in 
Weight to Equal Three Pounds. 
A Tablespoonful of Olive Oil. 
A Tablespoonful of Butter. 
The Juice of 1 Lemon. 
A Sliced Lemon. Parsley to Garnish. 

Sauce a la Maitre d'Hotel. 
There is only one way to cook Pom- 
pano and that is to broil it and serve 
with a Sauce a la Maitre d'Hotel. 

To broil the Pompano split the fish 
in the middle of the back if the fish i.^ 
large; if small, hrnil whole. Season 
well by rubbing with salt and pepper, 
mixed with a little sweet oil. Put the 
Pompano on the broiler and see that it 
is browned ivell on both sides, using al- 
ways the double wire broiler. Wlien 
done, place in a heated dish (heat 
by placing in a bain-marie or hot water 
bath and dry thoroughly). Butter the 
fish nicely and squeeze the juice of a 



lemon over it. Garnish with parsley 
and sliced lemon, and serve with a Sauce 
a la Maitre d'Hotel. (See recipe.) Tou 
will have a dish that a. king might envy 

SPANISH MACKBBEL. 

Maquereau Espagnol. 
Spanish Mackerel is another delicate 
and delicious fish, only to be found in 
the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. The 
Gulf of Mexico was, in early Creole 
days, a part of the vast expanse known 
as "The W^aters of the Spanish Main." 
The early Spanish fishermen found here 
a fish resembling the mackerel, but of a 
dainty delicacy of flavor far superior to 
any mackerel yet known to epicures, and 
they gave to it the name "Spanish Mack- 
erel." It stands on an equal footing 
with the Pompano in the estimation of 
epicures. The Spanish Mackerel should 
always be broiled. It is a splendid 
breakfast dish and a famous entree 
at dinners. 

Broiled Spanish Jfackerel.

Sauce a la Maitre d'Hotel. 

The Bluefish is a splendid fish of the 
salt-water variety, and much sought 
after. It should always be broiled. Split 
the fish in the middle of the back if 
the fish is large; if small, broil whole. 
Season well by rubbing with salt anil 
pepper, mixed with a little sweet oil. 
Put the Pompano on the broiler and see 
that it is browned well on both sides, 
using always the double wire broiler. 
When done, place in a heated dish (heal 
by placing in a bain marie or hot-water 
bath and dry thoroughly.) Butter the fish 
nicely and squeeze the juice of a lemon 
over it. Garnish with parsley and sliced 
lemon, and serve with a Sauce a la 
Maitre d'Hctel. (See recipe.) 
TROUT. 
De la Trulte. 

Of fine and delicate flavor, the Green 
Trout and Speckled Trout are great 
favorites in the New Orleans cuisines. 
Trout is especially recommended as * 
breakCast dish, nothing being more ap- 
petizing than this for a morning portion. 
It may be broiled or boiled. Tenderloin 
Trout cut into filets, or cutlets, is also 
fried and makes a most palatable dish. 
We have the Salt-Water TrO'Ut and the 
Fresh-Water Trout, and both are excel- 
lent.

Boiled Green Trout. 

Truite Verte Bouillie. 

6 Medium-Sized Trout, or 3 Large Onegi. 
A Kettle of Boiling Water. 1 Bay Leaf. 

1 Sprig of Thyme. 1 Sprig of Onion. 

A Clove O'f Garlic (if desired). 10 Cloves. 

2 Dozen Allspice. 

A Seedless Red Pepper Pod. 

A Bit of Lemon Peel. 

Parsley and Lemon to Garnish. 

Select fine fresh Trout. Clean an! 
wash the fish thoroughly. Make a small 
letter "S" with knife on the back; pa-ss 
twine around the body of the fish so as 
to secure it. Never wrap or tie in a 
cloth. Have ready a kettle of bc-iling 
water and throw in a sprig of onion, 
thyme and bay leaf, eight or ten cloves, 
about two dozen allspice, all mashed 
fine; a bit of lemon peel and a red pepper 
pod. When the water has boiled loufcj 
enough to have extracted the flavor cf 
these ingredients, drop the fish in care- 
fully, so as to avoid breaking. Let it 
boil about ten minutes and then take 
out carefully. Put into a strainer and 
drain quickly. Place on a platter on a 
bed of parsley, with chopped parsley 
thrown over, and garnish with parslev 
and sliced lemon. Serve with a drawn- 
butter iHollandaise Sauce o-r Sauce Geno- 
ise. (See recipe.) If the flavor of the 
spices is not desired the fish may bo 
boiled simply in the salt and pepper wa- 
ter, with sprigs of parsley. 

The Creoles add a clove of garlic to 
the boiling water, but this is according 
to taste. 

Broiled Green Trout. 
Truite Verte Grillee. 

6 Medium-Sized Trout, or 3 Large Ones. 
2 Tablespoonfuls of Butter. Juice of 1 

Lemon. 
1 Sliced Lemon and Parsley to Garnish. 

Follow implicitly the directions given 
under the heading "General Rule for 
Broiling Fish." (See recipe.) Clean the 
fish without cutting off the head or tail. 
Broil whole over a clear, moderate fire. 
Before placing on the broiler rub the fish 
well with salt and pepper, mixed in a 
little sweet oil cr a little butter oil. It 
the fish is small, broil on a quick, clear 
fire; if large, as mentioned above, the 
fire must be moderate, or the outside ol 
the fish will be charred before the in- 
side is done. When the fish is done 
through and through, which can easily 
be determined by the flesh parting easi'.y 
from the bone, remove the gridiron from 
the fire and Ibosen the fish from the 
broiler with a knife, 'being careful not to 
break the flesh. Then place the hot dish 
over the fish, and, with a dexterous 
movement, turn the two back again, thus 
separating the gridiron from the fish and 
placing the latter in the dish. Butter 
well, season with a little pepper and salt, 
if deemed necessary, and pour over a ta- 
blespoonful of chopped parsley and lemon 
juice. Serve with garnishes of parsley 
and sliced lemon.

or square pieces, slicing across tie back. 
Remove all the bones and rub well with 
pepper and salt, and a little sweet oil 
mixed with the pepper and salt. Place 



on the gridiro-n or double broiler and 
broil carefully, turning the broiler fre- 
quently to prevent the fish being charred 
before it is done. When nicely browned, 
place on a bed of parsley and garnish 
with sliced lemon. Serve with Sauce a 
la Tartare. (See recipe.)

secure it. Have ready a kettle of boiling 
water, and throw in a sprig of onion, 
thyme and bay leaf, the cloves and all- 
spice, mashed fine, a bit of lemon peel

30 



breaking. Let it boil ten minutes, and 
then take out carefully and drain quick- 
ly in a strainer. Place in a dish on a bed 
of parsley, sprinkle chopped parsley over 
it and garnish prettily with parsley and 
sliced lemon. The spices may be omitted

Ijonisiana Eels. 



De I'Anguille. 

Few of the American residents of New 
Orleans know the possibilities of pre- 
paring a most delightful dish that lurks 
in the often-rejected eel. But the an- 
cient Creoles inherited the taste of their 
French ancestors, who considered eels a 
delicacy, and have evolved from the tra- 
ditional recipes of old France pleasing 
and various ways of serving this fish. 
The most generally used in households 
is called 

Eels en Matelote. 

Or, More Familiarly, Matelote d'Anguille. 

2 Pounds of Eel, or a 2-Pound Fish. 
1 Large Onion. 
Pint of Button Onions. 1 Clove of Garlic. 
1 Tablespoonful of Lard. 
2 Tablespoonfuls of Flour. 
1 Glass of Good Claret. 1 Can of Mush- 
rooms. 
1 Pint of Oyster Water. 
1 Bay Leaf. 1 Sprig of Thyme. 
Croutons to Garnish. 

Matelote d'Anguille is a famous old 
Creole dish. The following Is the old 
Creole recipe, and when once eaten aft- 
er this mode of preparation, there is 
seldom a refusal to give the eel its due 
credit as a dish fit for the most fas- 
tidious gourmet. It should always be 
remembered that the largest eels are 
not the best for eating. The Creoles al- 
ways reject those taken from the river, 
near the wharves. The eels found in 
the bay and lakes are the most re- 
cherche. 

Clean and skin the eel, using about 
two pounds. Cut in one inch or two- 
inch pieces, as desired. Take one large 
onion and a half pint of button onions, 
or a clove or garlic, and chop fine. Make 
a roux with one tablespoonful of lard, 
adding, when hot, the chopped onions 
and parsley, and gradually adding, when 
these begin to brown, the two table- 
spoonfuls of flour. Pour In one good 
glass of Claret and a can of mushrooms. 
Add a pint of oyster stock or oyster 
water, and let cook a while. Season 
to taste with Cayenne and salt, adding 
^^% tV^ '**/ *?^ thyme. When it boils, 
add the eels that have been thoroughly 
cleansed and placed in cool water and 
aUowed to stand about fifteen minutes. 
When these are added to the matelote, let 
It simmer about an hour. Serve with 
fancy garnish of Croutons

lemon and serve hot. 

Stingaree. 

De la Raie. 

The Stingaree is a fish that the Ameri- 
cans laugh at, not dreaming of the pos- 
sibilities for a delicate dish that lurks 
within its wings. The Creoles, following 
in the wake of their French ancestors, 
who ate the Stingaree found in the wa- 
ters of the Mediterranean, have evolved 
a different dish from the old French 
cuisinieres, but one that holds its own 
even among the many distinguished 
French critics and gourmets who have 
visited our shores. It is called Raie 
au Beurre Noir. 

Stingaree au Beurre Noir. 

Raie au Beurre Noir. 

A Fine Young Stingaree.

Take a fine young Stingaree and cut 
off the tail. Cut the wings from the 
body and throw away the rest of the 
fish. Throw the wings into boiling wa- 
ter and parboil them. When boiled ten 
minutes, take them off the water and 
then take all the skin off. The flesh 
will then become as white as snow. Put 
one tablespoonful of butter in a frying 
pan and let it brown without burning. 
When a nice coffee color, add a handful 
of chopped parsley and let it brown for 
a half minute. Then add the juice of 
one lemon or a spoonful of French vine- 
gar. Pour this over the fish, salt and 
pepper to taste, and serve hot. This 
is a dish much affected by Creole con- 
noisseurs. 

Fried Stingaree.

Roi;. 

Oeufs de Poisson. 

1 Dozen Roe. 2 Tablespoonfuls of Butter. 

The Juice of a Lemon. 

Lemon Sliced in Quarters. 

Fish eggs are a great delicacy for tha 
reason that it is not often that sufficient 
can be bought to supply a dinner or 
breakfast table. The only eggs of fish 
that are used as an epicurean dish in 
New Orleans are the Roe of the Green 
Trout. These are exceedingly fine and 
delicate and are prepared after the fol 
lowing manner; First wash the eggs well 
and cut out fibers; butter a silver dish, 
or, if you have not one, a nice agate, 
and lay the Roe in the dish. Split them 
open, if large, and put a dot of butter 
o-n top of each. Sprinkle nicely with 
salt and pepper; place in the oven, baks 
a few minutes, and serve hot with lemon 
juice. 

Roe are also used to garnish a dish of 
fish whenever the eggs can be obtained 
in sufficient quantity. 

FBOGS. 
Des Grenouilles. 

Like their French ancestors. Frog legs 
are highly prized as a delicacy by the 
ancient Creoles. Properly cooked, they 
are much -more delicate than chicken 
and a great dish at recherche dinners. Tt 
must be remembered that only the hind 
legs of the froers are used, which must 
be first skinned and then thrown into 
boiling water for five minutes. Then 
take them out and put in cold water. 
When cold, take out of the water, and 
wipe dry with a clean towel. They are 
now ready for cooking.

CHAPTER IX. 
SHBLL FISH. 

Des Crustaches. 



Under this heading are classed the 
shell fish found in our Louisiana waters 
and those of the Mississippi Sound ad- 
jacent to New Orleans. Oysters 
Shrimp, Crabs, and Crawfish and the 
famous Green Turtle — these are the de- 
lightful varieties that are common ar- 
ticles of food among the people and 
which are to be had for the fishing. 

That delicious bivalve, the Oyster, has 
its hontie among us. Everyone who has 
visited New Orleans in winter has noted 
the exceptionally palatable oysters that 
are sold in every restaurant and by the 
numerous small vendors on almost every 
other corner or so throughout the low- 
er section of the city. In the cafes, 
the hotels, the oyster saloons, they are 
served in every conceivable style known 
to epicures and caterers. The oyster 
beds adjacent to New Orleans send to 
our markets the famous Bayou Cook and 
Barataria Oysters, eagerly sought and 
highly prized for exquisite flavor and 
unsurpassed in quality. The Mississipp' 
Sound is well-nigh stocked with oysters 
from one end to the other, and millions 
of cans are shipped yearly from Biloxi 
and other points to every point of the 
United States. And so with our cele- 
brated Lake and River Shrimp. No oys- 
ters are caught in the Mississippi Sound 
between May and September,- because 
they are somewhat milky and considered 
unfit for use, and so strict are the laws 
governing the uses of dredges in the 
Sound that a watchman accompanies 
each dredge-boat to see that no attemp* 
is made to use the dredge in less than 
fourteen feet of water, the idea being 
that dredges shall not be used where the 
water is sufficiently shallow to admit of 
their being dug of tongs. Thus are pre- 
served, in all their splendid flavor and 
almost inexhaustible supply, our oyster 



beds, and while the yearly increase in 
consumption of this delicious bivalve 
has tended to alarm scientists and to 
awaken an interest in the question as to 
whether the American oyster beds may 
not likely become depleted, scientists ac- 
quainted with the oyster beds on our 
Gulf coast, say that for domestic pur- 
poses there are sufficient oysters to sup- 
ply the United States. The railroad fa- 
cilities for handling oysters can hardl> 
be improved, and fresh and fine and 
ready to be eaten, they arrive in our 
markets. The Bayou Cook and Barataria 
Oysters are with us all summer, and 
New Orleans is the acknowledged com- 
mercial center of the oyster trade on the 
Gulf coast. 

New Orleh-ns opened the eyes of the 
United States to the possibilities of the 
oyster in every variety and form of 
cookihg. Her chefs evolved the mo&t 
dainty and palatable ways of preparing' 
them, and while raw oysters remained 
practically an unknown quantity in aris- 
tocratic centers in other states of the 
Union, the Creoles, quick to discover and 
apply, placed the raw oyster on their 
table as one of the greatest delicacies 
that could be offered the most fastidi- 
ous appetite. In the following recipes 
are given the most delightful manner of 
serving: 

OYSTERS. 

Huitres a la Creole. 

There has already been given, in the 
chapter devoted to soups, the several 
ways that the Creoles have of prepar- 
ing oysters in this style. (See Oyster 
Soups.) In a general treatment of oys- 
ters, it presents, first, that famous but 
exceptionally palatable manner in which 
oysters can be eaten at all hours, day 



34 



or night, without overloading the stom- 
ach or causing the least symptom of in- 
digestion, viz: 

Baw Oysters on Half Shell. 
Huitres en Coquilles. 
6 Oysters to Each Plate. Cracked Ice. 
Maunsell White or Black Pepper, Cay- 
enne and Vinegar. 
Lemon, Sliced or Cut in Quarters. 

Allow six oysters to each person where 
the bivalve is used to begin I he dinner 
or breakfast. Have the oysters opened 
in their shell and remove one-halt of 
the shell. Drain the water from the 
oyster shell, without disturbing the oys- 
ter, and place in plates, witli cracked ice, 
spri,nkled over with a quarter of a

Oysters Served in a Block of Ice, 

Huitres sur la Glace. 

6 Oysters to Each Person. A Square 

Block of Ice. 

Black Pepper and Cayenne. 

Sprigs of Parsley and Radishes to 

Garnish. 

Lemon Cut in Quarters. 

This is one of the prettiest ways of 
serving oysters at a dinner or luncheon, 
as well as one of the most recherche. 
Have your dealer send a square block of 
ice of the size desired and make a hollow 
in the center of the block by placing a 
flat-iron on the top, scooping out with 
the iron the shape desired. Then place 
a folded napkin on a platter and stand 
the block of ice upon it. Pepper the oys- 
ters nicely with Cayenne and black pep- 
per, and place in the ice. Then take 
sprigs of parsley and decorate the plat- 
ter, placing between decorated radishes, 
and alternate slices of lemon, and serve 
the oysters with lemon cut in quarters. 
The effect of this decoration is very 
charming. Smilax may be substituted 
for the parsley or mixed with it. The 
cavity should be squa.re and deep, leav- 
ing walls of ice about two inches in 
thickness.

cooking. Drain the oysters through a 
colander, lay them on a dish and wipe 
with a dry, clean towel. Melt butter 
and dip in the oysters, seasoned well 
with salt and Cayenne on both sides. 
Have ready the gridiron (use always the 
double wire broiler) and test the heat by 
dropping a little water on it. If the wa- 
ter hisses, the broiler is quite ready. 
Place the broiler in a warm place — ^just 
over the oven will do. Butter and place 
the oysters on it. Return to moderate 
coals. As soon as the oysters are 
browned on one side, turn on the other 
and brown. Have ready a heated dish 
and serve the oysters, pouring ovei 
melted butter and chopped parsley 
(chopped very fine). Garnish with 



sprigs of parsley and sliced lemon and 
serve immediately.

and cut into thin slits about the size of 
the oyster. Drain three dozen large, 
fat oysters; take a long skewer, of sil- 
ver or metal that is not dangerous, and 
string it first with a slit of bacon and 
then an oyster, alternating this until it is 
filled, the extreme ends terminating with 
the bacon. Then hold the ovsters over 
the clear fire and broil until" the edges 
begin to ruffle, when thev are done. In 
the meantime prepare some drawn but- 
ter by placing about a tablespoonful In a 
cup before the fire to melt; place the 
oysters In a hot dish, alternating with 
slices of bacon, sprinkle with pepper 
and salt, and pour over the drawn but- 
ter mixed with about one tablespoonful 
of parsley, chopped fine; garnish ■Willi 
slices of lemons and whole olives, and 
serve. The oysters and bacon may bf 
served on the skewers, if they are not 
charred or blackened; but the other Is 
the far daintier method.

Tried Oysters a la Creole. 

Huitres Frites a la Creole. 

6 or 8 Oysters to Each Person. 

1 Egg. 1 Glass of Milk. 

1-2 Teaspoonful of Salt. 1-2 Teaspoonful 

of Black Pepper. 
Grated Cracker or Bread Crumbs. But- 
ter Oil. 
Parsley. 
Sliced Lemon and Pickle to Garnish. 
Select the firmest and largest oysters 
allowing six or eight to each person. 
Drain in a colander and dry with a soft 
linen towel. Beat an egg thoroughly 
and mix with a glass of milk and a half 
teaspoonful of salt and pepper. Mash 
bread crumbs or crackers in another dish. 
Dip the oysters one by one in the milk 



and roll gently in the bread crumbs, 
patting softly with the hands, and drop 
into a deep frying pan, with sufficient 
lard or butter oil for the oyster to swim 
in it. In from three to five minutes 
the oysters will be done. The time giv- 
en will allow them to fry to a nice gold- 
en brown, and it will not be necessary to 
turn them if the oil in the pan is deep 
enough. Take them out with a skim- 
mer, being careful not to break, and 
drain on a piece of soft brown paper. 
Serve on a bed of fried parsley, with 
garnishes of sliced lemon and pickle. 
Bread crumbs are far preferable to 
crackers. Butter is often used in fry- 
ing oysters, but the butter oil is found 
by experience to be better than either 
lard or butter. Some also use commeal 
instead of the bread crumbs, but there 
is no comparison as to results.

of cream will improve the oysters. If 



this is used, .omit the lemon jmce. Line 
*>io amflll tins With tne pun pasie 
and puf in each three or four oysters 
according To the size of the paste. Cov- 
e? with the paste and bake in a quick 
oven about fifteen minutes. 

To make the open pates so much used 
at luncheon and entertainments In New 
Orleans, cut the puff paste into round 
cakes Those intended for the bottom 
crust should be about a little less than 
an eighth of an inch thick. Those in- 
tended for the upper layers should be a 
little thicker. Take a small biscuit cut- 
ter and remove a round paste from tlia 
center of these latter. This will leave 
a nice ring. Carefully place this upon 
the bottom crust, and then a second ring, 
until the cavity is deep enough to hold 
several oysters. Lay the pieces that 
have been extracted into a pan with 
these and bake to a fine brown m a 
quick oven. Then take out and fill the 
cavities with the oysters prepared 
as above, fit on the top very lightly, and 
set in the oven a second or two and 
serve. 

Oyster Pie. 

Vol-au-Vent d'Huitres. 

S Dozen Large, Fine Oysters. 

1 Tablespoonful of Butter. 

6 Tolks of Eggs. 

Spices, Thyme, Bay Leaf, Parsley. 

1 Slice of Grated Bread. 

Take an earthen dish which will hold 
about three and a half pints and line 
the sides with rich pie crust. (See recips 
for Pie Crust.) Set in the stove and let 
it bake a few minutes. In the mean- 
time take about one pint and a half of 
the oyster liquor and put on the fire, 
after having drained well. Add the sea- 
sonings of chopped herbs and Cayenne. 
Rub a tablespoonful of flour into the 
butter and add to the liquor, stirring con- 
stantly. Mash the grated crumbs; add 
to this, and mix well. Chop the hard- 
boiled eggs fine. Then pour the oysters 
into the pan of pie crust, sprinkle some 
of the chopped eggs and grated bread 
crumbs over, and put a teaspoonful ot 
butter in small bits here and there over 
this. Then roll out very fine and thin 
a layer of the pie crust. Place this over 
the preparation and ornament here and 
there, all around, with neat notches or 
designs, which can be easily formed witli 
the end of a spoon or the prongs of a 
folk. Cut a hole in the center in the 
shape of the letter "X." Set in a mod- 
erately quick oven and bake till brown. 
In the meantime, melt one tablespoonful 
of butter, add the remaining oyster liquor 
and season with pepper and salt. When 
it is about to come to a boil, add one- 
half cup ot rich, hot cream or boiled milK 
and when the pie is nearly brown, pal 
a funnel into the opening in the center 
and pour in as much of the liquor as 
the pie will hold. Place a delicate gar 
nish of pastry leaves over tlie whole and 
bake a minute or so longer. If there 
is any sauce left over, serve it with the 
pie. 

Great care must be taken not to have 
the oysters over done. For this reason 
the upper crust is often baked separate- 
ly, as the bottom of the pie is filled 
with the ingredients and the upper crusl 
placed on and served. Else the oj'S- 
ters are laid in layers while raw into the 
crust. But thev are liable to become 
too dry when used in this way.

pepper. Drain and set aside to cool. 
Take two crisp heads of lettuce leaves 
and arrange nicely in the salad bowl. 
Turn the oysters into the center of the 
leaves and pour over them the follow- 
ing dressing: Take the yolks of three 
raw eggs, half a teaspoonful of mus- 
tard, and a little salt ; beat these to- 
gether until they begin to thicken, ana 
add gradually olive oil, as in making 
Mayonnaise, until it begins to thicken. 
Add a little vinegar to thin and serve 
with the oysters.

1-2 Pint of White Vinegar. 

Salt o to Taste. 

1-2 Dozen Pepper Corns. 

Boil the oysters in their own liquor 
until the edges begin to ruffle. Then 
take a half pint of white wine vinegar 
and a half pint of the oyster water and 
set to boil, adding the blades of mace, 
cloves, allspice, pepper corns and a dash 
of Cayenne. Salt to taste, .as soon as 
they come to a good boil, pour the oys- 
ters into the boiling liquor. Care must 
be taken to have the oysters very cold, 
as they will make the pickles slimy oth- 
erwise. After adding the oysters to the 
boiling liquid, set it aside to cool. Put 
in a very cool ice box and serve cold. 
This is a delicious Creole luncheon dish. 

Oyster Loaf.

bottom like a square box. Brush each 
corner of the box and the bottom with 
melted butter, and place in a quick 
oven to brown. Fill with broiled or 
creamed oysters. Cover with each other 
and serve. 



CHAPTER X. 
SHELL FISH— (Continued.) 
Des Cnistaces. 



This chapter embraces methods of 
cooking Shrimp, Crab, Crawfish and 
Turtle, according to the most approved 
rules of the Creole Cuisine. 

SHRIMP. 

Dea Chevrettes. 

New Orleans is famous for the ex- 
quisite flavor of the River and Lake 
Shrimp which abound in its markets. 
The River Shrimp is the more delicate 
of the tw^o and is always eaten boiled 
as a preliminary to dinner or breakfast 
or luncheon. The Lake Shrimp, of larger 
size and firmer qualities, is used for 
cooking purposes, and is served in vari- 
ous delightful ways, known only to our 
Creole cuisinieres. From the Mississippi 
Sound and the New Orleans shore shrimp 
are sent deliciously canned to every part 
of the United States. In our markets 
they are sold fresh from the waters. 

Boiled Shrimp. 

Chevrettes Bouillies. 

100 Fine River Shrimp. 

A Large Bunch of Celery and Celery 

Tc-ps. 

2 Dozen Allspice. 2 Blades of Mace. 

1 Dozen Cloves. 

4 Sprigs Each of Thyme, Parsley and 

Bay Leaf. 

1 Red Pepper Pod. 

Cayenne, Black Pepper, Salt. Parsley 

Sprigs to Grarnish. 

Select fine large River Shrimp for this 

purpose. Into a pot of water put a great 

quantity of salt, almost enough to make 

a brine. Pepper a great bunch of celery 

and celery tops, chc'pped fine; two dozen 

allspice, two iblades of mace, one dozen 

cloves, mashed fine; thyme, parsley, bay 

leaf, chopped fine; Cayenne and a red 



pepper pod. When this has boiled so 
that all the flavor of the herbs have been 
thoroughly extracted, throw in the 
Shrimp. Let them boil ten minutes and 
then set the pot aside and let the Shrimp 
cool in their own water. Serve in a 
platter on a bed of cracked ice, and 
garnish with parsley sprigs. This dish 
is always served as a preliminary to a 
meal. A great deal of salt is required 
in boiling, as the Shrimp absorb but lit- 
tle, and no after addition can quite give 
them the same taste as when boiled in 
the briny water. 

Stewed Shrimp. 

Cnevrettes a la Creole. 

100 Fine Lake S'hrimp. 1 Large Onion. 

1 Tablespoonful of Butter. 1 Can ot 

Tomatoes or 12 Fresh Ones.

of Thyme. 

2 Bay Leaves. Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

A Dash of Cayenne. 

Get about 100 large Lake Shrimp for 
this recipe. Boil the Shrimp first ac- 
cording to the recipe given above, and 
then pick off the shells, leaving the 
Shrimp whole. Place them in a dish. 
Chop fine one large onion and brown it 
with a tablespoonful of butter. Add a 
can of tomatoes or twelve large, ripe to- 
matoes, chopped fine, in their own liquor. 
Stir well and brown lightly. Then add 
three or four Btalks of celery, a clove of 
garlic, a dash of Cayenne, a sprig of 
thyme, two bay leaves, all chopped finely 
and seasoned with salt to taste. After 
this has cooked ten minutes add the 
Shrimp. Let them cook ten minutes 
longer and serve. Never pour water into 
stewed Shrimp, as the tomato juice 
makes gravy enough.

season well with salt and pepper. Chop 
celery fine and add a little onion. Place 
the Shrimp in the salad dish and pour 
over all fine Mayonnaise Sauce (see 
recipe) and garnish with sliced hard- 
boiled eggs, sliced lemon, beets and celery 
tops, making a beautiful and welcome 
dish at any luncheon, tea or home affair. 

A Shrimp Bush. 

Buisson de Chevrettes. 
100 Lake Shrimp. 
Celery Tips. Asparagus Tips. 
A Shrimp Bush is a famous Creole hors 
d'oeuvre, and forms a very handsome ta- 
ble decoration also. Boil the Shrimp ac- 
cording to recipe. (See recipe Boiled 
Shrimp.) Take a glass fruit or cake 
stand, the fruit stand with several tiers 
bemg prettier. As Shrimp are small, 
they cannot be hung gracefully around 
the stand as in a Crawfish Bush. (See 
recipe.) They are, therefore, piled, first, 
into a small deep dish, and a close cover 
is put on to press them down. They are 
then turned over and will be found cling- 
ing together in one solid mass. If a cake 
stand is used, set a glass bowl or goblet 
on it. Place the Shrimp on top of this 
glass bowl or goblet; then take dainty 
bits of celer\- tips and asparagus tips, 
and heap around as for a border. 
Another row is formed a little lower, and 
again intermingled with asparagus tips 
and celery tops, between which the pink 
bhrimp are gracefully placed and glim- 
mer. The effect is very pretty. The 
Surimp are served from the bush as aa 
hors d'oeuvre. The effect of the pink 
against the green looks for all the world 
like a bush of green and red. 

CBABS. 

Des Crabes. 
New Orleans points with pride, and 
lustly, not only to the splendid supply 
of crabs that are to be found at all 
seasons in her markets, but to the vari- 
ous delightful ways that the natives have 
of serving them. The following are 
recipes that have been handed down by 
the Creoles from generation to genera- 
tion, and no modern innovations of cook- 
ery have been able to improve upon 
them. 

Hard-Shell Crabs. 

Crabes Durs. 
There is a science in eating the hard- 
shell Crab cooked in its own shell. The 
Creoles have reduced this to a fine point 
and a crab may be eaten without once 
using the fingers, if one only follows tie 
following simple direction: " 



41 



How to Eat a Hard-Shell Crab Cooked 
In Its SheU. 

The shell and claws should be cracked 
in the kitchen, very gently, before being 
brought to the table, if the Crabs are 
boiled and served whole. By a delicate 
manipulation of the knife and fork re- 
move the "aprcn" or "tablier," which is 
the small loose shell running to a point 
about the middle of the under shell. 
Then cut the Crab claws off, still using 
the knife and fork, and finally cut the 
Crab into parts, and these again in two. 
Proceed to extract the meat from each 
Quarter with the fork and eat with salt 
and pepper. It is considered quite 
"comme il faut"' to use the fingers, how- 
ever, in holding the Crabs, extracting 
the meat with the prongs of the fork. 
Boiled Crabs. 
Crabes BoulUis. 
1 Dozen Fine Crabs. 1 Bunch of Celery 
and Celery Tops. 

2 Dozen Allspice. 4 Sprigs of Thyme. 

4 Sprigs of Sweet Basil. 

4 Sprigs of Sweet Marjoram. 3 Blades 

of Mace. 

3 Bay Leaves. 4 Sprigs of Chives. 
A Red Pepper Pod. A Dash of Cayenne. 

Black Pepper and Salt Sufficient to 
Make a Brine. 

Proceed in the same manner as for 
soiling shrimp. Buy fine, large Crabs. 
The livelier they are the better. 
The Crabs must be alive when 
put into the pot. Have ready a large 
pot of waiter. Throw in bunches of 
celery tops, stalks of celery chopped fine, 
four or five large sprigs each of thyme, 
chopped sweet basil, marjoram, chives, 
two dozen allspice, three blades of mace, 
three bay leaves, chopped fine; a pod of 
red pepper, a dash of Cayenne, black 
pepper and salt enough to make the 
water briny. When this has boiled long 
enough to have extracted all the flavor 
of the herbs throw in the live crabs and 
let them boil rapidly for about ten min- 
utes, or until the shells are a bright red, 
but do not let them boil one minute 
longer than this, as they will become 
watery. Let them cool a little in their 
own water and then take out, strip off 
the "dead man's fingers," crack the claws 
without breaking open, and pile high 
in a broad platter and serve with salt 
and pepper. 

Stewed Crabs. 
Crabes a la Creole. 
1 Dozen Large Live Crabs. 
Tablespoontul of Butter or Lard. 
1 Stalk Chopped Celery. 
1 Dozen Fresh Tomatoes or 1 Can. 
Thyme, Parsley, Bay Leaf, 1 Clove, 
Garlic. 
S'alt and Cayenne to Taste. 
Boil a dozen fine large Crabs about 
five minutes in order to kill them. Take 
off the fire and place in a dish. When 
sufficiently cooled cut off the claws and 
crack, separating the joints. Remove the 
"apron" or "tablier" of the Crab and 
the "dead man's fingers," and take off 
the spongy substance. These are the por- 
tions that are uneatable. Remove the 
shell, cut the body of the Crab into four 
parts, cutting down the center across. 
Chop a large onion very tine and brown 
with butter or lard, using a tablespoon- 
ful of either. Add a dozen fine, large, 
fresh tomatoes, chopped fine, m their 
liquor, and brown nicely. Stir in chopped 
celery, thyme, parsley, one bay leat. 
chopped fine; pepper and salt to tast-i, 
and a dash of Cayenne pepper. Add one 
clove of garlic, chopped fine. Taste and 



add more seasoning if necessary. Let 
the mixture cook ten minutes, then add 
the Crabs and let them cook ten minutes 
longer. Never add water to this sauce, 
as the liquor of the tomatoes is suffi- 
cient and makes an excellent sauce. 
This is a fine fast-day dish. Serve with 
boiled rice or potatoes boiled whole. 
Fried Crabs. 
Crabes Frites. 
1 Dozen Fine Large Crabs. 
1 Pint of Milk. 
6 Tablespoonfuls of Butter or Lard. 

Stale Bread Crumbs, Grated. 
Thyme, Parsley, Bay Leaf, Onions. 
Boil the Crabs according to recipe. Cut 
off the claws and crack and cut the 
Crabs into quarters as for stewing. 
Season well with pepper and salt. Have 
ready a pint of milk. Mix pepper and 
salt in proportions of about two tea- 
spoonfuls each. Have ready a pan of 
boiling lard and a plate of grated bread 
crumbs. Dip the Crabs into the milk 
and then roll in the bread crumbs and 
drop into the boiling lard, frying about 
ten minutes or until a golden brown. 
Serve on a platter with the claws piled 
in the center, the bodies of the crabs 
grouped nicely around, and garnish with 
sprigs of parsley. This is a delicious 
way of serving Hard-Shell Crabs. 
Stuffed Crabs. 
Crabes Farcis. 
1 Dozen Large, Fine Crabs. 
1 Large Onion. 1 Clove of Garlic. 
1 Bay Leat. 3 Sprigs of Thyme. 
3 Sprigs of Parsley. 
Hot Pepper. 1- Tablespocnful of Butter, 
S'alt to Taste. 
1 Cup of Wet Bread. 
Boil the Crabs according to recipe. 
Take off the fire and let them cool in 
their own water. When cool crack the 
claws and pick out all the meat. In 
like manner, after having removed the 
uneatable portions, pick out all the meat 
from the bodies. Season well with salt 
and black pepper. Chop the onions and 
herbs very fine. Put a tablespocnful of 
butter heaping over into the frying pan. 
As it melts, add the chopped onion, and 
when it begins to fry add the crab meat» 
which has been thoroughly seasoned with 
the chopped thyme, bay leaf, parsley and 
a dash of Cayenne to taste. Let this fry 
and add a small clove of garlic, chopped 
very fine, and finally add the bread,, 
which has been wet and thoroughly 
squeezed of all water. Mix this well 
with the ingredients in the frying pan 
and let it fry about five minutes longer. 
Then take off the fire and let it get cool. 
Take a dozen of the finest and large'jt 
crab shells, or as many as this mixture 
will fill, and wash and stuff with the 
mixture, forming it into a rolling lump. 
Sprinkle this with grated bread crumbs 
and put a dot of butter on top, or, better 
still, sprinkle with the melted buttsr; 
place in the oven and bake about five 
minutes, or until a nice brown. Place on 
a platter and garnish with sprigs of 
parsley or celery tops. This is an ex- 
cellent method of preparing Stuffed Crabs 
for family use.

Boil the Crabs according to recipe. 
Clean and cut and piclc out all the meat. 
Chop an onion fine; chop the thyme, hav 
leaf and parsley and hard-boiled eggs, 
and mix well with the crab meat. Seasjn 
highly with hot pepper and salt to taste. 
Put one tablespoonful heaping over with 
butter into the frying pan. As it melts 
add the onion and fry, being 'Careful not 
to burn. Then add the crab meat, and, 
if desired, the very small clove c-f garlic, 
chopped very fine. Let this fry about 
five minutes, stirring constantly. Mix 
thoroughly, fry three minutes longer, 
and then take off the stove. Stuff the 
crab shells, forming a i^oUing lump in the 
middle. Sprinkle lightly with grate 1 
T3read crumbs, and put a dot of butter 
on top. Place in a quick oven and let 
them bake about five minutes, or until 
^ nice brown. The same or even bettor 
results are obtained by omitting the 
egg, many claiming that the delicals 
flavor of the crab meat is more daintilj 
preserved without this addition. This is 
a delightful way of serving Crabs for 
luncheons, or where it is not necessary 
to make, as the Creoles say, "a long 
family dish." 

Deviled Crabs. 

Crabes a le Diable. 

1 Dozen Fine, Large Crabs. 

2 Tablespoonfuls of Flour. 

1 Tablespoon of Salt. 

1 Tablespoonful of Chopped Parsley. 

1 Half Pint of Cream. 1-4 Nutmeg 

Grated. 

1 Tablespoonful of Butter. 

The Yolks of 4 Hard-Boiled Eggs. 

Salt and Cayenne to Taste. 

Boil the Crabs according to recipe. 
Take out and drain after they have 
cooled in their own water. Break off 
the claws, separate the shells, remove 
the spongy portions and the "dead man's 
fingers," and then pick out the meat. 
Put the cream on to boil, rub the flour 
and butter together well and add to the 
boiling cream. Stir and cook for two 
minutes. Take from the fire and 
add the crab meat< the yolks of the hard- 
boiled eggs, mashed very fine; the 
chopped parsley, grated nutmeg, salt 
and Cayenne. Clean the upper shells of 
the Crabs, fill them with the mixture, 
brush c-ver with a beaten egg, 
sprinkle with bread crumbs and put 
in a quick oven to brown; or, better 
still, if you have a frying basket, plun.ge 
the Crabs into the boiling fat or lard 
until a nice brown. But many prefer 
them baked. 

Scalloped Crabs. 

Coquilles de Crabes. 

The Meat of 1 Dozen Picked Crabs. 

A Dash O'f Grated Nutmeg. 

Bread Crumbs. 1 Egg. 

Pepper and Salt to Taste. 

Boil and pick the Crabs according to 
recipe given above. Beat an egg thor- 
oughly and add to the meat, which has 
been seasoned highly with Cayenne and 
salt to taste. Take one ciove of garlic, 
chop fine and add, then sift into this 
mixture fine grated bread crumbs or 
cracker crumbs, and mix thoroughly. 
Beat an egg, roll the Crabs into boulets 
or graceful meat balls, and then bind by 
rolling lightly in the egg. Roll in the 
bread crumbs, grated nicely, and then 
drop into boiling lard, and fry until a 
pale golden brown, which will generally 
require about three minutes. The secret 
Is to have them cooked just enough, for, 
as a rule, they are generally overdone. 



Wash and clean the shells thoroughly; 
wipe dry, set a boulet in the center of 
each and garnish prettily with sprigs of 
parsley and sliced lemon. This is a dainty 
dish for breakfast or luncheon. They 
must be served very hot.

a, little milk to moisten. Butter a baking 
pan and cover the bottom with a layer 
of bread. Then put in a .ayer of crab 
meat and lay over at intervals slices of 
lemon cut very fine and thin. Dot here 
and there with bits of butter, and then 
spread over another layer of bread. Then 
another layer of crabs, and repeat till 
the meat is used up. Lay on top a thick 
sprinkling of bread crumbs, dotted with 
butter. Place in the oven and bake for 
about twenty minutes. Serve hot. 

Soft-Shell Crabs. 

Crabes Mous. 

The Soft-Shell Crab has always been 
considered a great luxury in New Or- 
leans, where its possibilites as a most 
delicate and savory dish were first dis- 
covered. Northern epicures, quick to 
appreciate the toothsome morsel, re- 
turned to their homes loud in their 
praises of this Creole discovery. The 
Soft-Shell Crab is now being shipped 
North, and is a popular feature of the 
Northern markets, though the prices 
range very high. It is said that the Crab 
is so delicate that it does not stand ship- 
ment very well; sudden stopping of the 
express car often kills them; a clap of 
thunder will frighten them to death, 
while a sunbeam through glass will kill 
every one it shines upon. The Soft-Shell 
Crab is found the year round in the New 
Orleans French Market. This Crab is at 
its best when prepared according to the 
following Creole methods: 

Fried Soft-SheU Crabs. 

Crabes Mous Frites. 

1 Dozen S'oft-Shell Crabs. 

1 Quart of Milk. Bread Crumbs. 

Salt, Pepper and Cayenne to Taste. 

The greatest care must be taken in 
preparing and cleaning the Crab. Wash 
carefully, remO'Ving all sand, but do not 
scald or blanch thena, as this destroys 
the fine flavor completely. Remove the 
spongy, feathery substances under the 
side points. These are called the "man- 
eaters," and are very irritating and indi- 
gestible. Remove also the sand bag or 
"sand pouch" from under the shells just 
between the eyes; also remove the 
"tatalier" or "apron." Then wash well in 
cold water and dry with a clean towel. 
Take a pint of milk and season well with 
pepper and salt; season the crabs and 
crack- them in the milk, rubbing thor- 
oughly, so that the milk may thoroughly 
impregnate them. Take out and roll in 
a little sifted flour. Pat lightly with 
the hand, shake off superfluous flour 
and fry in boiling grease, being always 
careful to have sufficient grease In the 
pan for the crabs to swim in it. When 
a delicate golden brO'Wn, take out of th3 
grease with a skimmer. Drain on a piece 
of heated brown paper, and serve on a 
bed of fried parsley, with garnishes of 
sliced lemon. Serve with "Sauce a la 
Tartare." (See recipe.) 

Broiled Soft-Shell Crabs. 
Crabes a la Creole. 

1 Dozen Soft-Shell Crabs. 

1 Pint of Milk. 

4 Tablespoonfuls of Flour, Sifted. 

Butter. Sliced Lemon. 

Parsley Garnish. 

It was a celebratnd New Orleans chef 
who first decided t'» broil the Soft-STicll 
Crab. His success was great and 'Crabes 
a la Creole" were in great demand at 
once at the hotels and restaurants. To 
broil the Soft-Shell Crab always use the 



double wire broiler. Clean the crab ac- 
cording to the method given above and 
wash in cold watfr. Dry with a clean 
towel and season T/ell. Season a pint of 
milk with salt a -id black pepper, and 
soak the crabs in it so as to thoroughly 
impregnate them with the milk. Then 
pat lightly with a little flour and brush 
over with melted butter. Place between 
the broiler and broU till a delicate brown 
over a slow fire. It will generally re- 
quire about fifteen minutes to cook thor- 
oughly. Serve on a platter, nicely gar- 
nished with pars' ey, sprigs and lemon 
cut in quarters. Pour over the craba 
a little melted bu'iter and chopped pars- 
ley, and yo-u "will have a famous Creola 
dish. 

CBAWPISH. 

Des Kcrevisses. 

Besides the famous Crawfish Bisque 
(Bisque d'Ecrevisses. See recipe) the 
Creoles have dainty ways of serving this 
typical Louisiana shell fish. Among the 
most popular are the following: 

Boiled Crawfish. 

Des Ecrevisses Bouilles. 
50 Crawfish. 1 Gallon of Water. 

1 Herb Bouquet. 
Half Gallon of French Vinegar. 

Put the water on to boil, adding the 
chopped herb bouquet, one clove of garlic 
(chopped fine), one dozen allspice and 
six cloves. When the water has boiled 
long enough to have extracted all the 
juices of the herb bouquet, add white 
wine or the vinegar and salt — enough to 
make it almost briny, and Cayenne 
enough to make it hot. Then throw In 
the crawfish and let them boil about 
twenty minutes or until a bright red. 
Set them to cool in their own water and 
serve on a platter piled high in pyra- 
midal shape, and garnish nicely with 
sprigs of parsley and sliced lemon. Serve 
with salt and pepper, oil and Chili vine- 
gar, each person making the dressing as 
it suits his taste. 

Crawfish Baked a la Creole. 
Ecrevisses Gratinees a la Creole. 

50 Crawfish. 2 Livers. 

1-2 Can of Mushrooms. 

, 2 Tablesijionfuls of Butter. 

1 Bouquet O'f Fine Herbs. 

The Tolks of 2 Eggs. 

Salt, Pepper and Cayenne to Taste. 

Boil according to recipe fifty large, 
fine Crawfish. When cooked, allow them 
to cool in their own water. Clean them, 
picking off the shells and leaving the 
craTvfish whole. Take out all the small- 
est ones, and cut off the tail ends of the 
largest and place with the small ones; 
take the remainder of the large craw- 
fish and cut up, and make a dressing 
with , two chopped livers, parsley, the 
minced contents of one-half can of mush- 
rooms, the bouquet of fine herbs, con- 
sisting of thyme, bay leaf, sweet mar- 
jorana, etc.; chop a half dozen shallots 
and add to the dressing, and season 
highly with Cayenne and salt and black 
pepper to taste. Cut up the yolks 
of two eggs and mix with a cup of the 
soft portion of bread, which has been 
wet and thoroughly squeezed of all wa- 
ter. Place two tablespoonfuls of butter 
in a frying pan and add the dressing 
when it begins to heat; cook about ten 
minutes and then place in the dish In 
which the crawfish are to be serve!, 
making a bed of the dressing. Arrange 
with symmetry and grace the reserve 



44 



crawfish upon this bed ; cover lightly 
with the rest of the stuffing, and dot 
with small bits of butter, after sprinkling 
w^ith grated bread crumbs. Poiir over 
all a Cream Sauce and the juice of a 
lemon. Place in the oven and let it bake 
about ten or fifteen minutes, and serve 
with Cream Sauce, seasoned with lemon 
juice. fSee recipe Cream Sauce.) 
A Crawfish Bush. 
Buisson d'Ecrevisses. 

100 Fine Crawfish. Celery Tips. 
Asparagus Tips. Parsley Tips. 

This is a celebrated Creole hora 
•d'oeuvre, as also a very handsome and 
graceful table garnish. BO'il the Craw- 
fish ac^.ording to recipe. (See recipe.) 
Take a glass fruit or cake stand and 
place in the center of the table. Set a 
goblet upon it. Fit the goblet with celery 
tips and parsley tips, and hang a number 
of Crawfish gracefully around the goblet 
from the rim or outer edges. Continue 
hanging the dish with celery, asparagu? 
and parsley tips, and hanging the Craw- 
fish around the edges of the fruit stand, 
and in and out amid the greenery. The 
effect of the red amid the green is very 
pretty, presenting the appearance of a 
beautiful bush cf red and green. The 
Crawfish are served from the bush. 

TURTLE. 

De La Tortue. 
In addition to the delicious soups al- 
ready given, the Creoles serve turtle 
after the following manner: 

Green Turtle Steaks. 

Filets de Tortue. 

2 Pounds of Turtle Steaks. 



2 Tablespoonfuls of Butter. 
Salt and Pepper to Taste. Sliced Lemon 

and Parsley to Garnish. 
Currant Jelly Sauce or Sauce Poivrade. 

Select the female Turtle, as the meat 
is best. If bought alive from the market 
clean according to recipe. (See recipe for 
cleaning turtle. Otherwise the butcher 
may prepare it, as is frequently done in 
the New Orleans market.) 

Turtle meat is very irregular, there- 
fore cut the meat into thick slices or 
.steaks, about the size of a filet of bee', 
and batter down with the hands tc make 
smooth and regular. Then fry in butter. 
Season well with salt and pepper arid 
garnish with parsley and lemon, and 
serve w^ith Currant Jelly Sauce or the 
delightful Sauce Poivrade. (See recipes.) 

Stewed Turtle. 

Ragout de Tortue a la Bourgeoise. 

2 Pounds of Turtle Meat. 1 Onion. 

1 Tablespoonful of Butter or Lard. 

1 Tablespc-onful of Flour. 

\ Bay Leaf. 1 Clove of Garlic. 1 Sprig 

of Thyme. 

1 Cup of Water. 

A Wineglassful of Sherry or Madeira. 

Cut the meat of the Turtle about .in 
inch in size. Chop an onion and put all 
into a saucepan, with a tablespoonful of 
lard to brown. As it begins to brown, 
add a tablespoonful of flour, one bay 
leaf, one clove of garlic and a sprig of 
thyme, choppe.d very fine. Mix this thor- 
oughly with the turtle meat, then add a 
wineglassful of Sherry or Madeira, and 
a cup of water, and eo-ok for half an 
hour. 



CHAPTER XL 
SALT AND CANNED FISH 

Poissons Sales. 
Halibut, Salmon, Fresh Codfish, Fresh 
Lobster, Shad and other fish pecuUer to 
the Northern and Eastern waters are 
rarely seen on New Orleans tables, ex- 
cept in the great hotels and restaurants, 
which import them. With these fish, in 
their fresh state, this book will not treat. 
But the Salt Codfish, Salted Mackerel 
and Canned Salmon are in general fam.- 
ily use. The Salted Mackerel and Cod- 
fish, indeed, enter very largely into th« 
daily household economy of New Or- 
leans, especially on fast days, as also 
sardines. The following recipes are mod- 
eled after Creole methods of preparation: 
CODFISH. 
Salted Codfish. 
De la Morue. 
T'irsl, and above all, it is necessary to 
"dessaler la MoTue," as the Creoles put 
it, or to remove every trace and appear- 
ance of the salt in which the fi^ has 
been put up. Always soak the Codfish 
at least overnight or twenty-four hours 
before using in cold water, changing the 
water as often as possible, to assist in 
removing the salt; and always boil on 
a hc^ fire fifteen or twenty minutes be- 
fore making into any of the following 
dishes: B^u^^ Codfish. 

La Morue Bouillie. 
Codfish. 3 Dozen Oysters. 
1 Tablespoonful of Butter. 1 Table- 
spoonfuls of Flour. 
2 Gills of Fresh Cream or Milk. 
The Oyster Water. 
Salt and Pepper to Taste. 
A Dash of Cayenne. 



Boil the Codfish about thirty or forty 
minutes, after soaking overnight; drain 
and serve with an Oyster Sauce, or Sauce 
aux Huitres, prepared as follows: Make 
a Cream Sauce (see recipe), only use, in 
this case, the slrained juice of the oyster 
to blend the flour and butter, and add 
the rich cream or milk to make up the 
desired quantity. Scald the ousters in 
their own water about three minutes, 
and then add to the sauce, miixing thor- 
oughly, seasoning with salt, pepper and 
Cayenne, using preferably celery sail; 
let it boil up once and serve with the 
boiled Codfish. Egg Sauce (see recipe) 
may also be used with Boiled Codfish, 
but is not to be compared to the Oyster 
Sauce. 

Fried Codfish. 

La Morue Frite. 

Codfish. 1 Pint of Milk. 
1 Egg. 1 Cup of Grated Bread Crumbs. 
Salt and Pepper to Taste. 
Parsley and Lemon to Garnish. 
Soak the Codfish overnight, and boll 
twenty minutes, or until very tender; 
take out and cut into slices of one-inch 
thickness, and dry with a clean towel, 
have ready a pint of milk, and season 
well with pepper only; season the Cod- 
fish, rubbing a little black pepper to 
taste and a dash of Cayenne over it. 
S'oak the fish in the milk, and have ready 
some crushed bread crumbs and a well- 
beaten egg' when the fish is well soakecl, 
take out of the milk and dip each slice 
first into the egg, and then roll in bread 
crumbs, patting lightly, and drop in to 
the boiling lard; the fish must swim In 



45 



the lard. When fried a golden brown, 
take out with a skimmer, drain off all 
fat, and serve hot on a bed of fried 
parsley, garnished with sliced lemon. 

Stewed Codfish. 

Morue Sautee a la Lyonnaise. 

1 Dozen Small Potatoes, or Left-Over. 

Salt Cod, Enough for Six Persons. 

1 Quart of Milk. 1 Dozen White Onions. 

3 Tablespoonfuls of Butter. 

1 Tablespoonful of Flour Blended Witn 

Two of Milk. 

If the potatoes are not the left-over 
from the day before, wash and peel, and 
also the c-nion; boil the potatoes till 
tender; soak the fish overnight, and boil 
for twenty minutes, or until tender. Then 
cut the fish into pieces of about two or 
three inches in length. Put a tablespoon- 
ful of lard in the stewpan and lay in 
the potatoes and then the onions, and 
the Codfish on top; add enough cold 
water to cover the whole, and let it 
simmer until the fish is well cooked. 
Then take out the fish, and allow the 
potatoes and onions tc simmer on. Re- 
-move every piece of bone from the fish, 
and trim edges nicely. Take another 
saucepan and dissolve in another stew- 
pan the butter and flour, as directed 
above; let this simmer gently without 
browning, and then put in the potatoes, 
onions and fish in the order given above, 
pour over this the quart of cream or 
milk; let it simmer for about ten min- 
utes more till the milk comes to a boil, 
and serve hot. 

Creamed Codfish. 
Morue a la Creme. 

3 Cups of Picked Codfish. 

1 Pint and a Half of Cream. 

The Tolk of 1 Egg. 

Soak the Codfish overnight, and then 
let it boil about forty minutes. Then 
take off, scald again and drain, and 
again scald and drain, allowing it to 
stand each time about four or five min- 
utes before changing the water. Put one 
large tablespoonful of butter in the fry- 
ing pan; when melted add the flour and 
blend, without browning; then add the 
milk, stirring constantly until it boils, 
and then add the fish, seasoning highly 
with pepper and Cayenne. Let it boll 
about ten minutes longer, and take off 
the fire; then add the yolk of an egg, 
which has been beaten thoroughly, and 
serve hot, with plain boiled potatoes 
buttered. 

Codfish Balls. 
Croquettes de Morue. 

2 Cups of Picked Codfish. 

2 Cups of Mashed Potatoes. 

1-2 Cup of Cream. 
Bread Crumbs. 2 Beaten Eggs. 
Pepper and Cayenne to Taste. 
Soak the Codfish overnight and boil 
until tender. Pour off this water, and 
scald* again with hot water; pick fine, 
scald again and then drain thoroughly, 
pressing out all the water. Mash the 
potatoes, and melt about three table- 
spoonfuls of butter and mix well in the 
potatoes. Then add the Codfish and mix 
thoroughly, seasoning with about a tea- 
spoonful of black pepper, and a dash 
of Cayenne to taste. Add this to the 
cream, and again mix. Mold the Codfish 
into round or oval balls; then roll in the 
egg, which has been well beaten, and 
pass through the bread crumbs, patting 
gently, and lay them In a frying basket, 
If you have one, and sink into the boilin? 



lard, having tested the lieat with a bit 
of bread. The balls must swim in the 
lard. Otherwise drop into the boiling 
lard. When a golden brown, lift out the 
basket, or skim out the balls with a 
skimmer; drain well of all the fat by lay- 
ing on a heated brown paper, and then 
serve hot on a dish garnished with sprigs 
of parsley. This quantity will make 
about a dozen and a half balls or cro- 
quettes. There is no difference between 
the preparation of the Codfish Ball and 
the Codfish Croquette, the only differ- 
ence being in the form of molding, the 
croquette being oval or elongated, in 
cylindrical shapes, and the ball being 
molded round and a little flattened on 
tcp. 

Codfish Bacalao. 
Bacalao a la Vizcaina. 

1 Pound of Salted Codfish. 
1 Large Onion, Chopped Fine. 

1 Pint of Rich Tomato Sauce. 

2 Cloves of Garlic, Chonped Fine. Crou- 
tons. 
1 Red Pepper. 

2 Tablespoonfuls of Olive Oil. 
Pepper to Taste. 6 Tomatoes. 

Thyme. Bay Leaf. Parsley. 

Soak the Codfish well overnight, and in 
the morning boil for about forty-five 
minutes, until very tender. WTien you 
set it to boil, put the fish first in cold 
water. After it has boiled scald again 
thoroughly, and pick out all the bones 
and set away to cool. Then prepare a 
rich Tomato Sauce, according to the fol- 
lowing directions: Take six large fresh 
tomatoes, or a half can of toma- 
toes, and add a heaping tablespoon- 
ful of butter, four sprigs of parsley, 
thyme and two bay yeaves, all chopped 
very fine; add two chopped onions ana 
a clove of garlic, chopped fine, and which 
has been fried in a little butter. Set 
the saucepan, with the sauce, into boil- 
ing water, and add pepper and Cayenne 
and a pinch of salt to taste. Stew very 
gently for about two hours or longer, 
if necessary. Then strain the sauce and 
make a roux with one tablespoonful of 
butter and two of flour; stir and let it 
brown lightly, and stir in the sauce. Boil 
about four minutes longer until rich ana 
thick. Then fry the remaining large 
onion and clove of garlic, chopped very 
fine, in a gill of olive oil, or two table- 
spoonfuls of butter if the taste of the- 
oil is disliked, apd when it browns add 
this to the sauce and a red sweet pepper, 
finely chopped. Cut about a dozen Crou- 
tons in dice or diamond shapes, from 
thp Fiift part of the bread, and fry in 
boiling iJrd. Heat a dish, put the Cod- 
fish into it, pour over the Tomato Sauce, 
border the dish with the fried Croutons, 
and set in the oven, allowing it to bake 
' eu or fifteen minutes longer. The Span- 
ish red peppers are the best fpr this 
sauce. Black pepper may be added if 
desired. 

SALT MACKEREL. 
Du„ Maquereau. 

Salt Mackerel is either boiled or broiled, 

and either method of cooking according 

to the subjoined recipes makes a niost 

palatable and delicately toothsome dish. 

Boiled Salt Mackerel. 

Maquereau Bouilli. 

2 tS'alt Mackerel. 

2 Tablespoonfuls of Butter. 

Chopped Parsley and Sliced Lemon to 

Garnish. 



46 



Soak the Mackerel overnight, and in 
the morning take out of the water, wash 
thoroughly, taking off every portion of 
salt, and wash again. Have ready a deep 
pan of boiling water; place the Mackerel 
within and let it boil ten or fifteen min- 
ultes until done, which can be known by 
the flesh beginning to part from the 
bones. Serve wKole on a platter gar- 
nished with parsley. Pour over the Mack- 
erel melted butter and chopped parsley, 
and bring to the table very hot. 

Mackerel boiled or broiled is a very 
nice breakfast dish on fast days. Serve 
with potatoes, boiled whole or made into 
croquettes. 

Broiled Mackerel. 
Maquereau Grille. 

2 Salt MaJckerel. 1 Cup of Milk. 
2 Tablespoonfuls of Butter or a Cream 

Sliced Lemon, Olives and Parsley 
Sprigs to Garnish. 

Soak the Mackerel and wash thorough- 
ly as directed above, only using boiling 
water. Have ready some milk, seasoned 
well with black pepper, a,nd soak the 
Ma;ckerel in the milk until thoroughly 
impregnated. Take out and wipe dry 
with a towel. Then dredge the Mackerel 
■with butter, and place between a double 
broiler, over a slow fire, broiling about 
fifteen or twenty minutes, the under side 
being allowed to broil first. WTien done, 
take off and pour over melted butter and 
chopped parsley; garnish the dish with 
sprigs of parsley, sliced lemons and 
olives, and serve hot. A Cream Sauce 
may be also served instead of the butter, 
and makes a very delicious dish. 

SALMON. 

Mayonnaise de Saumon. 

1 Can of Salmon. 2 Heads of Crisp 
Lettuce. 
1 Cup of Milk. 
1 Tablespoonful of Butter. 2 Tablespoon- 
fuls of Flour. 
1 Tablespoonful of Chopped Parsley. 
Salt and Pepper to Taste. 
Sauce a la Mayonnaise. 
A Mayonnaise of Salmon Is a very 
good luncheon dish, and is frequently 
served in New Orleans. To one can of 
Salmon allow two good-sized heads of 
young lettuce. Make a bed of the crisp 
hearts of the leaves, and tear the other 
leaves into small pieces with a fork, 
making very delicate shreds. Drain the 
oil from the can of Salmon, and separate 
the fish into flakes. Take a cupful of 
boiling milk and a tablespoonful of but- 
ter and two of flour, and stir over the 
fire until quite siTiooth. Add to this a 
tablespoonful of chopped parsley and the 



Salmon. Season with pepper and sajt, 
and let it cook about ten minutes. Set 
aiway to cool, and then place on the bed 
of lettuce leaves. Cover with a Sauce a 
la Mayonnaise (see recipe), and garnish 
nicely with sliced hard-boiled eggs, celery 
tips, etc., and serve. 

Salmon Salad, 
Saumon en Sajade. 
1 Can of Salmon. 
1-3 the Quantity of Chopped Celery. 
2 Hard-Boiled Eggs. 
Sliced Lemon. Olives. 1 Pickled Beet 
A Plain French Dressing. 
Canned Salmon may be made into a 
delightful salad for luncheon or sup- 
per. Flake the Salmon, heap into a salad 
bowl, and mix with chopped celery, using 
one-third of the latter in proportion to 
the quaffitity of Salmon. Add a Plain 
French Dressing. (See recipe.) When 
refidy to serve turn into a salad dish, 
on which you have arranged a crisp bed 
of lettuce. Garnish with sliced lemon, 
olives and hard-boiled eggs, and with one 
daintily sliced pickled beet. 
HEBBINGS. 
Des Harengs. 
The Salted Herrings, such as come to 
New Orleans, must first of all be soaked 
thoroughly overnight, or longer, to take 
away all salt. Then they are cleaned 
nicely and broiled and served with a 
cream sauce or drawn butter sauoe, pref- 
erably the former. They are also cut into 
filets and eaten without further cook- 
ing, or "Cru," as we say here, and also 
as an hors d'oeuvre. 

ANCHOVY. 
Des Anchois. 
Anchovies are served as a preliminary 
to the most aristocratic dinners, being 
drained of the oil which clings to them 
after being taken from the can. Three 
or four Anchovies are then placed be- 
tween delicate soda biscuits, and tied 
with a bit of ribbon in squares, with a 
dainty bow cut short in the center. The 
effect is very pretty. The Anchovies are 
also mashed a,nd placed between the 
crackers, like a sandwich. Either way is 
excellent and elegant. 

Anchovy Salad. 
Salade d'Anchois. 
This salad is a dainty dish for lunch- 
eon or supper. Have an oval dish and 
arrange the Anchovies, drained of oil, 
crosswise on a bed of crisp lettuce, or of 
chopped watercress. Surround with a 
border of chopped whites of eggs and a 
similar border of chopped watercresses, 
and pour over all a sour French Dress- 
ing. (See recipe.) Anchovies are used 
as an elegant hors d'oeuvre. 



CHAPTER Xn. 
MEATS. 

Des Viandes. 



Meats are, of course, common to every 
clime and country, but not every people 
have the palatable and appetizing meth- 
ods of preparation that have been hand- 
ed down to the Creoles of X^ouisiana by 
their French and Spanish ancestors and 
so modified and improved upon that it 
may be said that they have created a 
new school of cookery in the choice prep- 
aration and serving of beef, veal, mutton, 
pork and venison. Our "roties" or roasts, 
our methods of broiling, our delightful 
"ragouts," our famous "griUades," our 
unique "daubes," in a word, our dozen 



and one highl>' nutritious and eminently 
agreeable combinations of nieats, with 
"\'egetables, and our unequaled majiner of 
seasoning, have given to the Creole 
kitchen a fame that has been as lasting 
as well deserved. 

The Creoles have discovered that al- 
most any portion of the beet from the 
head to the tail may be delicately and 
temptingly prepared, "so as to please even 
the most fastidious p.Tlates, They have 
reduced the science of cooking meats to 
a practical system that works the most 
beneficial effects in the homes of the 



47 



poor, and which enables the family of 
modera,te means to live not only econom- 
ically, but with as much real ease and 
luxury even as the wealthy classes. 

Bules Which the Creoles Follow In Cook- 
ingr Meats. 

Always remember that Beef and Mut- 
ton must be cooked rare, and Pork 9.nd 
Veal well done. 

Beef should always be roasted, broiled 
or smothered. 

Mutton may be roa,sted, broiled, boiled 
or ste'wed. 

Veal may be roasted, stewed, smoth- 
ered or fried, when cut into chops. 

Pork is always roasted or fried. 

Ham is broiled, boiled or fried. 

Bacon is broiled, fried or boiled, the 
latter when cooked with vegetables. 

Venison is roasted or made into "rag- 
out," like Beef a la Mode,, and the out- 
lets are broiled. The meat of venison 
should be of fine grain and well covered 
with fat. If the venison is very young, 
the hoofs ate but slightly opened; if old, 
the hoofs stand wide apart. 

With this preliminary we will now pre- 
sent the various Creole forms of pre- 
paring meats. 

BEBF. 

Du Boeuf. 

Boast Beef. 

Boeuf Roti. 

The first four ribs of the beef are al- 
ways the best for a roast. The tender- 
loin lies here, and two good ribs or a 
"full cut," as the butchers term it, should 
be enough to naake a fine roaist for a 
family of six. Always remember that if 
the roast is cut too thin the juices dry 
too rapidly and the exquisite flavor is 
gone. After the ribs come the sirloin 
and the spine bone as second and third 
choice. Have the butcher skewer the 
roast so that it will have a nice shape 
when it comes on the table, apd will re- 
tain all the juice of the beef. Leave the 
bones in the roast, as the meat will be 
far sweeter than when taken out. Rub 
the meat well with salt and pepper, 
dredge slightly with lard and set in a 
hot oven. The heat of the oven at once 
coagulates the blood and prevents it 
from escaping, thus rendering the meat 
nutritious. Every now and then baste 
the beef with its own juices and let it 
cook, a'ddirig no water, as sufficient fat 
runs from the beef to baste with. Al- 
low fifteen minutes to every pound of 
meat it one likes the meat rare, otherwise 
allow twenty minutes. But the Creoles 
always roast beef rare. To ascertain the 
desired state, occasionally stick a needle 
into the beef. If the blood spurts up, 
the meat is ready to serve, and, cooked 
to this point, is a most nutritious dish. 
Watch carefully and do not let it pass 
this stage. Serve on a dish in its own 
gravy. 

Filet of Beef Larded. 
Filet de Boeuf Pique. 

1 Filet of Beef. 

Lajrd Sufficient to Lard Thoroughly. 

1 Small Onion. 1 Bay Leaf. 

4 Cloves, if desired. 

1 1-2 Tablespoonfuls of Butter. 

1 Tablespoonful of Glace. (See recipe.) 

1 Glass of Madeira or Sherry Wine 

(or Water). 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

Trim the filet nicely, removing the 

outer muscular skin. Lard the filot well, 

using larding needles. The lard must 



be very thin, like a shoestring. The lard- 
ing is done by filling the needles with 
the lard and pushing them through the 
filet as far as they will go. If the needles 
are long enough they will come out on 
the other side of the filet, leaviag the 
lard within. Repeat this process all down 
the center aJnd along the sides of the 
filet, about an inch apa-rt, and have the 
rows neat and even. If you have not a 
larding needle, make incisions with a 
knife, and push the lard in with your 
finger, but the filet is never as juicy and 
tender, nor does it look so clean and 
even when baked. Wlien well' larded, 
dredge well with salt and pepper, rub- 
bing this thoroughly into the beef. Cut 
up one small onion, one bay leaf, and 
mash four cloves, and place in the bot- 
tom of the baking pan. Lay the larded 
filet on this bed, the larded side being 
uppermost. Put small bits of butter equal 
to a half taiblespoonful on top, ajnd bake 
in a quick oven thirty minutes. This 
dish is always eaten_ rare. To ascertain 
if sufficiently done, stick a fork into the 
filet; if the blood bubbles out, it is ready 
to serve. The meat when done is always 
spongy and elastic to the touch. 

In the meantime prepajre the follow- 
ing brown sauce: Take one talalespoon- 
ful of butter and one of Glace (see recipe 
under chapter "Sauces for Meats, Fish, 
etc."), and three of water; rub smooth- 
ly and melt in a saucepan, stirring 
constantly to prevent burning. When 
brown add one glass of Madeira or Sher- 
ry wine and add a half cup of water. 
Season well with salt and pepper. Pour 
over the filet, which must be placed in 
a hot dish, and serve. 

Filet of Beef liarded With Mushrooms. 

Filet de Boeuf Pique aux Champignons. 

1 Filet of Beef. 
1-2 Can of Mushrooms. 
Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

Trim and lard the beef according to 
the directions given in the above recipe, 
and bake in the saane manner — rare. 
When it has cooked for a half hour in 
a quick oven, it wil be done. Then make 
a sauce as follows: Take one tablespoon- 
ful of butter and one of Glace and three 
of water; melt the butter and add the 
Glace, browning nicely without burning, 
and stirring constantly. When brown 
add one glass of Madeira or Sherry wine, 
if desired, and one-half pint of water. 
Season well with salt and pepper. Then 
add a half can of mushrooms, chopped 
very fine. Stir well and let it boil about 
ten minutes, so ais not to be too thick 
nor yet too thin. The intelligent cook 
will judge by tasting to see that it is 
seasoned properly. Place the filet in a 
hot dish and pour the sauce over and 
serve hot. 

Filet of Beef With Truffles. 

Filet de Boeuf Pique aux Truffes ou a la 
Perigeux. 

1 Filet of Beef. 1-4 Can of Truffles. 

1-2 Glass of Sherry. 1 Pint of Broth or 

Water. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

Proceed in the same manner as in the 
preparation of Filet of Beef Larded. 
When it has baked for a half hour make 
a sauce as follows: One tablespoonful of 
butter in a saucepan; add two table- 
spoonfuls of Glace (see recipe under 
chapter "Saueos for Meats, Fish, etc.") 
and add a half Tyineglass of Sherry and 
one pint of broth or water. Let it boil 
slowly for ten minutes, and add one-half 



48 



can of truffles, chopped very fine, if a 
la Perigeaux; it aux truffes, cut in dice. 
Let the sauce boil slowly twenty min- 
utes longer, and then pour over the filet, 
serving hot. 

Broiled Beefsteak. 

Filet de Boeuf Grille. 

3 Pounds of Steak for Broiling Purposes. 

1 Tablespoonful of Butter. The Juice 

of 1 Lemon. 

Chopped Parsley and Lettuce Leaves to 

Garnish. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

The cut known as the "Porterhouse 
Steak" is unquestionably the best for 
broiling. The next in order is the sir- 
loin, where there are always choice cuts, 
but the entire sirloin is not profitable 
for broiling and the coarse ends may be 
used in making stews, gumbos, etc. There 
is an art in broiling a beefsteak properly, 
and the Creoles have certainly attained 
this in its perfection. The broiler- in a 
well-regulated household is always put 
on a furnace of hot charcoals in prefer- 
ance to the open front of the stove. The 
coals not only render the meat free from 
any deleterious effects, should, by an\ 
chance, the meat not be from a perfectly 
healthy animal, but the broiling over the 
coals gives the meat a flavor one vainly 
seeks otherwise. Dredge the meat well 
with salt and pepper and then brush 
lightly with butter. Place it on the hot 
gridiron and let it broil quickly for four 
minutes; then turn on the other side for 
four minutes longer. When done take 
oft, plajce in a hot dish, butter nicely and 
sprinkle chopped parsley over, and the 
juice of a lemon, and serve immediately. 
Smothered Beefsteak. 
Filet Braise. 

Braising or smothering meat is a mode 
ot cooking little understood by the 
Americans, but which has been brought 
by the Creoles to a high state of per- 
fection. By this process the meat is Just 
covered, and no more, with a little 
water, or with a strong broth made from 
anim£i stock or the juices of vegetables. 
The pot is covered with a closely-fitting 
lid and is put on a slow fire and allowed 
to simmer slowly for two or three hours, 
just short of the boiling point. By this 
slow process of cooking, tough meats are 
rendered juicy, tender and very agree* 
able to the palate, while the covered pot 
enables the meat to retain all its flavor. 

The great secret in smothering meat 
is to let it cook very slowly, simmering, 
however, all the time, so that the heat 
may thoroughly penetrate and render 
tender and juicy the coarse fiber of the 
meat. When tender, put the beefsteak 
into a platter, cover with the onions and 
gra\'y, and you will ha\'e a delicious and 
delicately flavored dish. 

Beefsteak Smothered in Onions. 
Filet Braise aux Ognons. 

3 Pounds of Round Steak. 

6 Onions, sliced fine. 1 Tablespoonful of 

Lard. 

1 Tablespoonful of Flour. 

2 Tablespoontuls of Vinegar. 

2 Sprigs Bach of Thyme and Bay Leaf. 

3 Sprigs ot Parsley. 

1 Clove ot Garlic. 

1 Pint of Water. 

Pepper and Salt to Taste. 

Beat the Round Steak well with the 
rolling pin or steak hammer; cut off the 
outer skin and press the meat back into 
shape. Place the tablespoonful ot lard 



in the deep trying pan ana let it melt 
Then lay in the sliced onions, and over 
these the beefsteak, which has been well 
seasoned with salt and pepper and 
dredged with the flour. Cover closely. 
Let it simmer over a hot fire for a few 
minutes and then turn the steak on the 
other side. After three minutes add two 
tablespoontuJs of vinegar, chopped pars- 
ley, thyme and bay leaf and a clove of 
garlic. Turn the steak, letting the flour 
brown well, and keep the pot closely 
covered. WTien brown pour over one cup 
of water, or a pint, which will be suffi- 
cient to cover the meat. Bring this to 
a brisk boil and set the pot back where 
it can simmer gently for about two 
hours. 

Filets of beef may be smothered in the 
same manner, only these will require no 
beating with the steajc hammer.

very fine, as also the garlic, thyme and 
cloves. Rub the shreds well with salt 
and pepper. Take the rump of beef and 
lard thickly by making incisions aibout 
three or four inches in length and in- 
serting the pieces of salt fat and spices. 
onion and thyme and garlic, mixed thor- 
oughly. Take two large onions and cut 
into quarters and put in a saucepan with 
one tablespoonful of lard. Let the slices 
brown and then lay on top the rump of 
beef, well larded. Cover closely and let 
it simmer very slowly till well browned. 
Then add the chopped bay leaf and pars- 
ley. "WTien brown add five carrots cut 
into squares of an inch, and two turnips, 
cut in the same manner, and two large 
onions, chopped fine. Let the whole 
brown, keeping well covered, and cooking 
.slowly over a slow but regular fire. Be 
always careful to keep the cover very 
tight on the pot. When it has simmered 
about ten minutes, turn the daube on the 
other side, cover closely and let it sim- 
mer ten minutes more. Then cover with 
sufficient boiling water to cover the 
daube; or, better still, if you have it, 
use instead of the water boiling "con- 
somme" or "pot-au-feu," and, if possible, 
a glass of Sherry or Madeira wine; or, 
if you have neither of these, which are 
always to be preferred in cooking meats, 
a glass of good Claret. Season according 
taste with salt, Cayenne and black pep- 
per. Cover the pot tight and set it back 
on the stove, letting it smother slowly 
for about three hours, or until tender. 
Serve hot or cold. 

Cold Daube a la Creole. 

Daube Froide a la Creole. 

This is one of the most excellent dishes 
made by the Creoles, and is always a 
great standby for luncheons in winter. 
Take 

3 Pounds of the Rump or Round of the 

Beef. 

2 Pounds of Veal Rump. 

2 Pig's Feet. 1-4 pound of Salt Pat Meat. 

5 Jjarge Onions. 2 Turnips. 



5 Carrots. 2 Cloves of Garlic. 3 Bay 

Leaves. 

1 Tablespoonful of Lard. 

1 Glass of Sherry. 

3 Sprigs of Thyme and Parsley. 

Salt, Pepper and Cayenne to Taste. 

Cut the salt meat into shreds, roll well 
in Cayenne and black pepper. Chop finely 
several sprigs of thyme and three bay 
leaves, one clove of garlic, three sprigs 
of parsley, and mash well three cloves 
and six allspice. Roll the strips of salt 
meat, which must be about three inches 
in length and one-half inch thick, in this. 
Make incisions into the rump of meat 
and force in the strips of fat meat and 
the spices. Then rub the whole well with 
salt and pepper, Judging according to 
taste and proceed to cook according to the 
recipe for Beef a lai Mode. Let the Daube 
cook about four hours when you intend 
to serve it cold. 

In the meantime, in another pot, place 
a veal steak of about two pounds, and 
two pig's feet. Season well with salt and 
pepper and Cayenne, and cover well with 
four quarts of water, and let them boil. 
Add one bay leaf, one sprig of thyme, 
one-half clove of garlic and one onion, 
all minced very fine, and two cloves 
mashed into almost a' jelly, and one glass 
of Sherry or Madeira wine. Let these 
boil well with the veal and pig's feet. 
Then, when the veal and pig's feet are 
cooked very tender, take them out of the 
pot and mince tb" meat of eajch very 
fine; return to the sauce, and again 
season highly, according to taste, for 
the flavor depends upon the piquant 
seasoning. After the daube has cooked 
foiir or five hours, take off the stove 
and pour over the sauce and set all in a 
cool plape. Serve the next day — cold, 
cutting into thin slices. It will all have 
formed a jelly that is most delicious and 
appetizing. 

Beef Marine. 
Boeuf Marine. 
4 Pounds of Beef, froni the Round oi 
Shoulder. 
4 Tablespoonfuls of Olive Oil. 
3 Bay Leaves. 1 Onion. 1 Lemon. 
1 Tablespoonful of Vinegar. 
1-2 Teaspoonful Each of Ground Cloves, 
Mace and Allspice. 
Salt and Cayenne to Taste. 
The "brisket" of the beef is excellent 
for this, as also the "breast-plate." Mix 
the spices, salt and pepper thoroughly 
and rub we'll into both sides of the beef. 
Chop the onions fine, and cover the meat 
with them. Then mix the oil and vinegar 
and the juice of one lemon, and pour 
this over the meat. Set it in the ice box, 
or a cool place, and let it stand over- 
night. Then put it into the stewpan, and 
be careful to retain all the juices of the 
spices. Set on the fire and let it simmer 
ten minutes, adding the bay leaves, 
chopped very fine. Then add a table- 
spoonful of flour, rolled smoothly in a 
half teaspoonful of butter or lard, melted. 
Let this brown, and then half cover the 
meat with boiling water, using good 
judgment. Cover closely and set on the 
oven, letting the beef cook two hours, 
and turning once, so thart. both sides may 
be well penetrated by the heat. Serve 
on a hot dish, pouring the gravy over. 
This is a very old-fashioned dish. 

Fried Meat. 

La Viande Frite. 

Frying among the Creoles is done in 

several ways. The first and the method 

most generally adopted in households Is 



50 



to put a tablespoonful of lard or an 
ounce, as the quajitity of meat to cook 
may seem to require, into a frying pan. 
When the lard has reached the boiling- 
point lay in the meat and cook first on 
one side, then on the other, to a nice 
brown. The second method is that in 
use among the Creole chefs, restaura- 
teurs, and in the homes of the wealthier 
classes; the meat is completely immersed 
In the boiling lard as in frying fish or 
doughnuts. The intense heat quickly 
closes up the pores of the meat, and a 
brown crust is formed; the heat of the 
lard should be such that a piece of bread 
dropped into it becomes brown instantly. 
The lard should never be smoking. This 
ruins the meat and gives a burnt flavor. 
As soon as it begins to smoke remove 
the frying pan to the side of the stove, 
but still keep it at the boiling point. The 
half -frying method mentioned aibove is, 
however, the one most generally in use, 
and if foUoTved properly, excellent re- 
sults are obtained ; indeed, many Creole 
chefs prefer it. There is another method 
that is very generally used, and w^hich 
imparts a flavor similar to that of 
broiled meat. This is to lay the meat in 
a thick-bottomed frying pan with a table- 
spoonful of butter. Brown the meat 
quickly first on one side and then on the 
other; lay in a hot platter and season 
as you would broiled meat. 

Fried Meat. 

Grillade. 

The round of the meat is always se- 
lected for Grillades, and one steak will 
serve six persons. The steak is cut into 
pieces of about six or eight squa^res, and 
each piece is called a "grillade." Season 
well with salt and pepper, rubbing these 
into the meat thoroughly atid letting It 
soak well into the fibers. Have ready a 
hot pan. and place within a tablespoonful 
of lard, and, when hot, a sliced onion and 
one clove of garlic, chopped very fine. 
Let this brown, and then add one 
chopped tomato. Place the Grillades In 
this, letting them soak thoroughly. Cover 
with a tight cover, and set back, letting 
them fry slowly, so as to absorb all the 
lard and juices. Serve on a hot dish, 
when brown, with garnishes of parsley. 
This is the recipe for making Grillages 
without gravy. Some also fry simply in 
the boiling lard, using only a half ta- 
blespoonful, and letting it soak and ab- 
sorb thoroughly after being well sea- 
soned. This is a matter of taste. 

Grillades With Gravy. 

Grillades a la Sauce. 

1 Round Steak. 

1 Tomato. 1 Large Onion. 

Sajlt and Pepper. 

Select a nice round steak and bea\ 
well. Cut into grillades" of about four 
inches square and season highly with 
salt and pepper and Cayenne. Put'a ta- 
blespoonful of lard into the frying pan, 
and when it heats, add a chopped onion, 
one clove of garlic; and as these brown, 
add one tablespoonful of flour, making 
a Brown- Roux. (See recipe under chap- 
ter "Sauces for Meats, Fish, etc"). Then 
add two tomatoes, sliced, with their 
juices, and as this browns lay the gril- 
lades upon it. Cover closely, and a« it 
browns on one side, turn on the other. 
Then add a half tablespoonful of vinegar 
and a cup of water. Stir well and set 
back on the stove and let it sinimer 
slowly for about a half hour. This Is 
very nice served with hominy at break- 



fast, or with red or white beains and 
boiled rice at dinner. 

Again, the Grillades a la Sauce are 
made by frying the grillades, after sea- 
soning well, pimply in half a tablespoon- 
ful of boiling lard. The lard must al- 
ways be boiling, so that the meat juices 
may at once coagulate. After they are 
browned nicely on both sides, take the 
grillades out of the frying pan and set 
in a hot dish over a pot of boiling water 
and cover. Have an onion chopped finCf 
put half a tablespoonful of laffd into the 
frying pan, stirring w^ell to detach all 
particles of meat that may have ad- 
hered. Then add a chopped onion and 
brown, and a tablespoonful of flour or 
Glace (see recipe under cha,pter "Sauces 
for Meats, Fish, etc.") and let this brown. 
Pour in a tablespoonful of vinegar and 
a cup of water, season well with salt, 
pepper and Cayenne, and let it boil till 
it reaches a right consistency, which 
will be in about ten minutes. Pour over 
the grillades. and serve. 

Grillades Breaded 

Grillades Panees. 

1 Round of Veal. 

1 Tablespoonful of Lard. 

1 Beaten Egg. 1-2 Cup of Bread Crumbs. 

Salt. Pepper and Cayenne. 

The round of the veal is always used 
for this. Cut the veal into squares of 
about four inches; season vrell with salt, 
pepper and Cayenne. Beat an egg well 
and take each grillade and soak well in 
the egg, and then roll in bread crumbs 
grated. Have ready a pan of boiling 
grease, sufficient for the grillades to 
swim in it ; fry to a nice brown and 
serve very hot. 

Left-Over Meat. 

Left-over meat may be utilized in many 
delightful ways, such as "Boulettes,'* 
"Boulards," "Croquettes," "Rissoles," 
"Meat Souffle" and various forms of 
Hash. The following are the forms of 
preparation in use among the Creoles: 

Meat Balls. 

Boulettes. 

1 Pound of Raw or Left-Over Meat. 

1 Tablespoonful of Butter. 1 Onion. 

The Juice of a Lenion. 

Salt, Pepper and Cayenne to Taste. 

Take one pound of steak from the up- 
per round and mince and chop very fine. 
Add to it one tablespoonful of lemon 
juice, one onion (well grated), one table- 
spoonful of melted butter, and mixed 
salt, black pepper and Cayenne, season- 
ing highly; mix all thoroughly. Form 
the meat into balls, using about two ta- 
blespoonfuls for each, which will allow 
six or eight balls or boulettes. Have* 
ready a deep frying pan of lard, suffi- 
cient for the boulettes to swim and fry 
to a nice brown. Take out and drain of 
all grease, place on a hot platter and 
garnish with fried parsley, and serve 
very hot. 

The same directions may be used In 
making croquettes of meat," only the lat- 
ter are formed into cylindrical shapes. 
If fried in butter, the boulettes. or cro- 
quettes, are very delicious, but they are 
nice either way if well seasoned, for their 
success depends upon this.

of ginger. Salt and pepper to taste. 
Take each slice of meat, and make a 
roll of it, folding the dressing within and 
folding over the edges that it may be re- 
tained. Tie each with thin twine. Have 
boiling lard or suet on the fire, drop in 
the boulards rolled in bread crumbs, set 
them back on the stove, cover well, and 
let them simmer gently for about two 
hours, adding a half cup of water to 
prevent scorching. Keep the pot cov- 
ered. After two hours, drain the bou- 
lards well by laying them on heated 
brown paper; place them in a hot dish, 
garnish it with sliced hard-boiled eggs, 
parsley and olives, and serve. Each 
Doulard should be about the size of an 
egg.

of chopped meat, or fowl, that has been 
left over. When this comes to a boil, 
add the yolk of two beaten eggs. Let 



it cook a moment longer and set to cool. 
Then beat the whites of the eggs, and 
when the meat mixture is cold, fold them 
in carefully. Turn this into a buttered 
dish and bake in a moderate oven twenty 
minutes. Serve as soon as removed from 
the fire. A little grated nutmeg is a 
great addition.

Broiled Kidneys. 

BrG<;hettes de Rognons. 

3 Kidneys. 
1 Tablespoonful of Butter. 
Lemon Juice. Chopped Parsley. 
Salt and Pepper to Taste. 
The kidneys must, first of all, be per- 
fectly fresh. "SVash them well and slice 
them; cut into thin pieces of about three 
inches long and two inches wide. Run a 
wooden or silver ske^Yer through to hold 
them together, and season well with salt 
and pepper. Brush -tvith a little butter, 
and put on a double broiler and broil for 
about fiA-e minutes, turning over the 
broiler to allow each side to cook. Place 
on a platter and pour over melted butter

Season well with salt and pepper. Put 
one and a half tablespoonfuls of butter 
into the saucepan; when melted and very 
hot add the kidneys and chopped herbs, 
being very careful to stir constantly and 
very fast, to prevent burning. Add a 
half glass cf White wine, if possible, 
and one cup of water or consomme. Let 
it iboil up once, and the kidneys are 
ready to be served. Kidneys are like 
eggs — they do not require long to cook, 
and the more they are cooked the harder 
they become. Five minutes should be 
sufficient to cook them well, and at no 
time should they be allowed to boil. By 
adding Champagne, instead of White 
wine, you will have Rognons Saute au 
Champagne.

the liver which you have cut into slices 
of about three inches in length and one- 
half inch in thickness, and seasc-n well 
with salt and pepper, and lay it over the 
onions. Stir well. Cover and let it fry 
for about three minutes, and then turn

1 Glass of White Wine (if Desired). 
Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

Parboil the tongue for abcut ten min- 
utes. Then skin and clean well. . Chop 
an onion very fine, and brown this in a 
tablespoonful of butter. When brown , 
add the tongue, which you will have ar- 
ranged by fastening the thick part to the 
tip with a skewer, as for roast beef. Let 
It cook, smothering slowly, for fifteea 
m^inutes, and then add another onion 
sliced nicely. Let this brown, and add 
one square inch of ham, well chopped, 
two carrots sliced, and a bay leaf, and 
two sprigs of thyme, minced fine. Brown 
again, and add a pint of broth. Season 
well, and add a glass of White wine, and 
then let it smother for one hour and a 
half longer, turning every quarter, so 
that every part may cook thoroughly. 
Serve with the sauce in which it was 
cooked, or jvith a Sauce Piquante. (See 
recipe.,) 



CHAPTER XIII. 
VEAL. 



Du 

The loin filet, shoulder and breast of 
the veal are used for roasting. Chops 
are cut from the loin, and the leg 'S 
used for filets and cutlets. The filet of 
veal is quite different from the filet of 
beef, and does not, in any manner, 
correspond to the latter, being a solid 
piece cut from the legs of the young calf. 
The knuckle is the lower part of the leg 
after the cutlets are taken off, and, with 
the neck, is used extensively for making 
Gtcws, soups and veal pies. Indeed, as 
far as stews are concerned, the Creoles 
never make a "beef stew" or very rarely, 
the meat of b6ef being con.sidered too 
tough. Never buy veal that is very 
young, for young meats, as a rule, are 
not nutritious; but properly cooked, as 
the Creoles know how, they need never 
be unwholesome or indigestible. A calf 
should never be killed until it is at least 
two months old, and then the meat has 
a pinkish tinge, and is firm and the 



Veau. 

bones are hard. Calf that has been 
killed too young may be known by the 
bluish tinge and the soft, flabby flesh, 
and small, tender bones. 

The Creole cooks always pound the 
veal almost to a pulp. This renders it 
very tender and digestible. Veal must 
always be well cooked, and cooked very 
slowly, else it will be hard, tough and 
unfit for food. 

Veal furnishes an almost endless va- 
riety of delightful dishes. The following 
are those mc-st important in use in 
Creole homes: 

Boast Loin of Veal. 

Longe de Veau Rotie. 

4 Pounds of Veal. 

1 Tablespoonful of Butter or Lard. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

Sprigs of Parsley and Sliced Lemon to 

Garnish. 



54 



Trim and cut the veal nicely of the 
heavier portion of the fat, leaving 
enough, however, to render it sweet and 
juicy. If freshly cut, and not handled 
too much by the butcher, merely wipe 
the loin with a damp towel. Then dredge 
it thickly with salt and pepper, and sep- 
arate the articlulations or Joints, that 
the meat may cook thoroughly. Rub 
well with a tablespoonful of butter or 
lard, and place in a very quick oven for 
about fifteen minutes. Then raise the 
damper cf the stove and cover the veal 
with a piece of brown buttered pap^ir 
and let it cook slowly, allowing at least 
twenty m'nutes to each pound of veal. 
Keep the oven at a steady, regular heat. 
About twenty minutes before serving 
take off the buttered paper and let the 
roast brown nicely, augmenting the fire 
a little. Take out, place on a hot dish, 
garnish nicely with sprigs of parsley 
and sliced lemcoi. Serve with its own 
gravy. The practice of making a gravy 
with flour for roast beef and roast veal 
cannot be too severely condemned. Meat 
Is always best when served in its own 
Juice, if roasted or broiled. 

Roast Veal With fine Herbs. 

Carre de Veau Roti aux Fines Herbej. 

A 4-Pound Filet of Veal. 

1 Cup of Broth or Water. 

1 Tablespoonful of Lard. 

1 Onion. 3 Bay Leaves. 

2 Sprigs of Sweet Marjoram. 

3 Sprigs of Parsley. 
3 Sprigs of Thyme. 

The juice of 1 Lemon. 

X-2 Teaspoonful Each of Ground Cloves, 

Mace and Allspice. 

Have the butcher cut the filet of veal 
square, wipe with a damp towel anrl 
then take one tablespoonful of lard an'.l 
dredge the roast nicely. Season well 
with salt and Cayenne: mince the onion, 
bay leaf, marjoram, parsley and thyme, 
and mix these with the ground spiojs; 
add the Juice of a lemon, and pour all 
over the meat. Place in a quick oven 
for about fifteen minutes. After this, 
lessen the heat, place on top of the veal 
a buttered piece of brown paper, and let 
it roast slowly, allowing twenty minutes 
for each pound of veal. When almost 
done take off the paper and let the roast 
brown nicely for twenty minutes longer. 
Then take the roast out of the graw 
and place in a hot dish in the oven. 
Take the gravy, stir well, mixing all the 
herbs that have run out of the beef. 
Add one cup of broth or water and the 
Juice of one lemon, and mix this thor- 
oughly. Grate some bread crumbs, beat 
well in one egg, and pour this over the 
veal, let it brown nicely and serve with 
the sauce. 

Filet of Veal With Mushrooms or 
Truffles. 

Filet de Veau aux Champignons ou aux 
Truffes. 

1 Filet of Veal. 

1-2 Can of Mushrooms or Truffles. 

1 Small Onion. 1 Bay Leaf. 

4 Cloves (if desired). 

1 Tablespoonful of Glace (see recipe). 

1 Glass of Sherry or Madeira Wine (or 

Water). 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

Proceed in exactly the same manner as 
for Filet of Beef Larded, with Mush- 
rooms or Truffles, only do not lard the 
veal> Allow ithe veal to cook much 
longer, for it must be well done, twentv 
minutes to the pound being a good guide 



always in roasting veal. (See recipe for 
Filet of Beef Larded, with Mushrooms 
or Truffles.) 

Stuffed Boast Shoulder or Breast ot 
Veal. 

Fpaule ou Poitrlne de Veau Farcie. 

1 Shoulder of Veal. 1-4 Pound of Ham. 

1 Herb Bouquet. 

1 Hard-Boiled Egg. 1 Tablespoonful of 

Butter. 

1 Spoon of Flour. 

(If the shoulder of veal is used, have 

the butcher remove the bone.) 

When ready to cook, wipe well with 
a damp towel, and then dredge with salt 
and pepper, seasoning highly. Make a 
dressing by taking one cup of stale 
bread, wet and squeezed, one-quarter 
pound of sliced ham, or salt pork, pref- 
erably the ham, and chop very fine. Mix 
this with the bread and season highly 
with hot pepper, according to taste; 1 
carrot, 1 onion, 1 bay leaf, 1 hard-hoUed 
egg, 1 sprig of thyme, 1 of parsley, all 
minced very fine. Add one tablespoon- 
ful of butter, and place In a frying pan: 
let it fry for about ten minutes and then 
add, if you have it, a quarter of a glass 
of Wliite "Wine, or two tablespoonfuls, 
and two tablespoonfuis of beef broth; 
stir well and cook for five minutes 
longer. Then stuff the shoulder well and 
skewer the filet to prevent the dressing 
from falling out in cooking. It is well 
to tie the veal at either end with a 
piece of twine. Take one tablespoonful 
of lard and dredge roast according to 
preceding recipes. 

If the breast of the veal is used, make 
long gashes between the ribs and fill 
with a dressing prepared as above; place 
in the baking pan and roast slowly, ac- 
cording to directions. When finished 
cooking, remove the shoulder or breast, 
and stir the gravy well, adding a cup of 
broth or water and the Juice of one 
lemon and a teaspoonful of butter, 
seasoning to taste. Serve with the roast. 
Some like the addition of a teaspoonf'jl 
of prepared mustard, but that is a mat- 
ter of taste. 

Veal Cutlets Breaded. 

Cotelettes de Veau Panees. 

6 Veal Cutlets. 

1 Egg. 1 Cup of Bread Crumbs. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste.

6 Veal Cutlets. 1 Egg. 
1 Cup of Bread Crumbs. 
1 Tablespoonful of Melted Butter. 
A Bed of Macaroni or Spaghetti.

on a bed of boiled macaroni or spaghetti 
and pour over the vifhole a Tomato 
Sauce. 

Veal Cutlets en Fapillotes. 

Cotelettes de Veau en Papillotes. 

6 Veal Cutlets. 

A Half -Pound of Pork Sausage Meat. 

1-2 Can of Mushro&ms. 1 Tablespoonful 

Butter. 

1 Clove Garlic. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

Use for this young and tender veal 
cutlets, cut very fine. Fry the chops, 
after seasoning well in butter, very 
slowly, and, when cooked, take out of 
the frying pan and put in a dish. Take 
a tablespoonful of butter and put in a 
frying pan. Add a half pound of sausage 
meat and a half can of mushrooms, 
chopped very fine. Mix well, and season 
with salt and pepper. Add a minced 
clove of garlic, and let it all cook five 
minutes. Take pieces of white foolscap 
paper and cut in cone or pyramidal 
shapes of the size of the cutlets. Fold 
the edges over the other -very nicely, 
doubling the paper to form the half dia- 
mond or cone. Then oil the paper well 
with sweet oil. Take the stuffing of 
sausage meat and put a layer on one 
side of the fold of each cone. Lay the 
chop diagonally across this, so that the 
end reaches the tip of the cO'ne, ana 
spread over this another layer of the 
stuffing. Fold the paper over neatly 
around the edges, and then oil well again 
on the outside. Bake in an oven or lay 
on top of a gridiron and broil until 
brown. This will be in about five min- 
utes. They will need no gravy, the oil 
having slightly permeated, and the chops 
being kept delicate and juicy by the 
dressing. Serve hot in vhe papers or 
papillotes, the guests removing them at 
the table. This is a very dainty way of 
serving veal cutlets, and the only way 
of serving them in papillotes. 

Veal Cutlets Smothered a la Creole.

Dredge with flour. Place the table- 
spoonful of lard in a deep frying pan 
and let it melt. Then lay in the sliced 
onions, and over these lay the cutlets. 
Cover closely. Let them simmer over .a 
hot fire for a few minutes and then turn 
the cutlets on the other side. After three 
minutes, add two tablespoonfuls of vine- 
gar, chopped parsley, thyme and bay 
leaf and a clove of garlic. Turn the 
veal, letting the flour brown well, and 
keep the pot closely covered. When 
brown, pour ever one cup of water, or a 
pint, which will be sufficient to cover 
the meat. Bring this to a brisk boil 
and set the pot back, where it can sim- 



nier gently for about two hours. S'erve

SWEETBREADS. 

Ris de Veau. 

Sweetbreads are the glands in the 
throat of a suckling calf. "■ hey are found 
in the throat of all very young suckling 
animals, but are more considerable in 
the throat of the young calf, and even 
then at the largest are seldom bigger 
than a man's fist doubled over. The 
sweetbreads are the glands used by the 
calf in sucking, and are only found in 
the young calf during the period when it 
is fed on its mother's milk. When a calf 
is turned out to grass, the sweetbreads, 
or milk glands, begin to grow smaller, 
and in three or four days disappear, no 
longer standing out in a mass of deli- 
cate flesh, but hanging long and soft and 
flabby. On account of their delicacy, 
sweetbreads have always been the object 
of particular attention of good cuisin- 
teres, because, in a fine, fresh state and 
with proper preparation they can bo 
made not only into a most delightful and 
palatable dish, but are, perhaps, the most 
recherche of all meat dishes. At least 
the sweetbreads have always been so 
considered by the French, who set the 
world the lesson of good eating hundreds 
of years ago; and the Creole chefs of 
New Orleans, improving upO'U old French 
methods of cooking, as well as originat- 
ing their own delicious combinations, 
sustain the verdict of the gourmets of 
the ancient mother country. 

HoTV to Blanch S^veetbreads. 

Select three fine pairs of sweetbreads 
and clean and trim nicely. Soak them 
for at least two and a half ho-urs in cold 
fresh water, pouring off the water from 
time to time till three separate waters 
have been used. About three-quarters of 
an hour may be allowed for the first two 
waters. Add a pinch of salt to each 
water. After soaking for the time speci- 
fied, drain the sweetbreads and place 
them in a saucepan of cold water and 
set on the fire; add a half teaspoonful 
of salt, and let them blanch till they 
come to a boil. Then drain and set them 
in cold water to freshen. Drain thor- 
oughly, press them into shape and lay 
on a napkin in a cool place. They arc 
now ready for general use. The sweet- 
breads should be pressed down gently

well. 

Sweetbreads Larded, With Mushroom 

Sauce. 

Ris de "Veau Pique aux Champignons. 

6 Sweetbreads. 1 Carrot. 

4 Thin Slices of Bacon. 

1 Onion. 1-2 Can of Musnrooms. 

1 Tablespoonful of Flour. 1 Tablespoon - 

ful of Butter. 

1 Whole Sprig of Thyme. 3 Bay 

Leaves. 

1 Wineglass of Madeira or STierry. 

1 Pint of Consomme. 

Salt and Pepper. Croutons. 

Soak the sweetbreads in clear, cold 
water as soon as you come from market, 
for they are so delicate that they spoil 
very easily. Wash well, to take off all 
the blood; wash again in a clear cold 
water, and parboil them for ten minutes 
Then drain them of all water, press them 
Into shape and put them on a clean clotn 
on a table and cover with a plank and 
put a weight upon them to flatten. When 
cold, clean with a knife, cutting off all 
the outside nerves, veins and fibers, 
without breaking the sweetbreads, how- 
ever. Cut fat lard into little strips like 
matches, and, with a larding needle. 
lard the sweetbreads, slipping the needle 
in on one side and bringing out on the 
other. Lard each sweetbread eight times. 
Then slice one onion and one carrot very 
fine; mince three bay leaves and a whola 
sprig of thyme. Take a very thin slice 
of very fat bacon, cut it into thin strips 
and cover the bottom of the saucepan 
with these. Lay the sweetbreads on top 
and put on tc-p of these the sliced onion, 
carrot and finely minced herbs. Salt 
and pepper by sprinkling nicely. Cover 
this with a few fine strips of fat bacon. 
Cover the whole with a brown paper, 
which has been well greased with butter, 
and put the pan in a slow oven with the 
paper on top. Let the sweetbreads bake 
for about twenty minutes, basting occa- 
sionally. In the meantime make a 
Sauce a I'Espagnole as follows: Chop a 
few pieces of beef very fine, or else use 
good stock. If meat is used boil in about 
two pints of water. When it is reduced 
to about one pint, take off and strain. 
Take a tablespoonful of butter or lard, 
and brown lightly with a tablespoonful 
of flour. Then add the water, and dis- 
solve well, stirring constantly to pre- 
vent being lumpy. Add to this a half can 
of mushrooms, and let it simnier a few 
minutes, and then add a glass of Sherry 
or Madeira w^ine. Let it coo-k rapidly 
for about ten minutes. In the meantime, 
the sweetbreads will have been cooked 
to a nicety. Take them out of tl^e pan 
and put one by one into the sauce, and 
let them cook ten minutes longer. Serve 
with buttered Croutons cut in dice 
shapes. Sweetbreads are always served 
with fresh young green peas. This is a 
famous Creole dish.

the same manner as indicated in th? 
above recipe, which is the very nicest 
way in which they can be served. Make 
the sauce as indicated, letting it brown 
slightly, and, instead of the mushroonas, 
add a can of French Petit Pois or a pint 
of fresh young green peas that have al- 
ready been boiled well and drained from 
all liquor. Place the sweetbreads in one

twenty minutes; then (Jrain of all wa- 
ter; press them into shape, lay on a clean 
napkm and cover with a plank and place 
a weight upon them to press and make 
solid. Take a piece of fine salt pork, 
and cut into little thin strips like matches 
and lard the Sweetbreads with this, using 
a very fine larding needle, and following 
implicitly the directions given in the re- 
cipe for Sweetbreads Larded With Mush- 
room Sauce. Lard each Sweetbread eight 
times. Then take a shallow saucepan 
and put within a half pound of butter. 
When the butter melts, lay in the Sweet- 
breads, one by one. Season with salt 
and pepper very lightly, and add the 
three carrots, sliced fine, and the onion, 
sliced very fine. Add the finely minced 
thyme and bay leaves. Butter a piece 
of brown paper and cover the saucepan; 
then set in the oven and let the Sweet- 
breads cook slowly till they are of a 
bright golden brown. Frcoi time to time 
uncover the saucepan * and turn the 
Sweetbreads, so that all portions of them 
may be evenly colored. When they have 
reached this beautiful color add one pint 
of good beef broth (Consomme or Bouil- 
lon), and let them simmer for a half or 
three-quarters of an hour. WJien near- 
ly ready to serve, prepare a Sauce a la 
Flnanoiere, as follows: Take two table- 
spoonfuls of butter, melt and remove 
from the fire, and add gradually a table- 
spoonful of flour; blend well with a 
wooden spoon till very smooth, and 
moisten with one pint of rich chicken 
broth and set on the fire. Add the truf- 
fles, nicely sliced; a dozen and a half 
stoned olives; the blanched chicken liv- 
ers, cut in pieces; the mushrooms, nice- 
ly chopped; a half pint of Madeira or 
Sherry wine, salt and pepper to taste, 
and a dash of Cayenne or Tabasco. Let 
the sauce cook for twenty minutes. It 
should be of the consistency of rich 
cream. Place the sauce in a round dish, 
lay the Sweetbreads over it, garnish 
with the Godiveau Quenelles and Crou- 
tons fried in butter and send to the table 
hot.

TBIFE. 

Tripe. 

Tripe, which is the large stomach of 
ruminating animals, is generally cleaned, 
scraped, bleached and prepared by the 
butchers before it is sold. It is nutri- 
tious and digestible. To prepare the tripe 
properly for cooking, wash it carefully 
in several waters. When thcTOUghly 
clean, put it in a kettle of cold water, 
add one tablespoonful of salt and one 
of vinegar, and let the tripe boil for five 
hours at least. It is always best, if tripe 
is to be used for breakfast, to prepare it 
and give the long boiling the day before. 
Drain thoroughly. Then it is ready for 
preparation according to any of the fol- 
lowing recipes:

little else for dinner besides a soup or 
gumbo. 



CHAPTER XIV. 
MUTTON 

Du Mouton. 



The leg, shoulder and loin of the mut- 
ton are used as roasting pieces. The 
brisket and neck are used for soups and 
stews, and from the loins are cut the 
delicate French chops or cutlets of mut- 
ton. Mutton is so susceptible of ele- 
gant seasoning, and so easily impreg- 
nated with the different aromatic herbs 
used in cooking that it becomes not only 
most agreeable to the taste, but tender 
and very easily digested. 

Something to Bemember in Cooking 

Mutton, 

Remember that mutton must never be 
breaded, and mutton chops fried. Tou 
will hear of mutton chops en 
papilotte, in imitation of the ways m 
cooking veal chops, but the Creoles veiy 
wisely and very sensibly refrain from 
cooking mutton in any other ways than 
those given in this book. No good Creole 
cC'Ok will eat a fried mutton chop. 

Boast Leg: of Mutton, 

Gigot Roti. 

1 Leg of Mutton. 
iSalt and Pepper to Taste. 

Select a fine, tender leg of mutton. 
Wipe thoroughly with a damp towel and 
dredge with salt and pepper, thoroughly 
rubbing, so that the meat may be pene- 
trated by the seasoning. Place the mut- 
ton in a baking pan, set in a quick oven 
and bake, basting every ten minutes or 
so, allowing twelve minutes to every 
pound. The mutton must never be over- 
done, but underdone. The Creoles always 
serve it rare. It will require no lard- 
ing, for the meat is rich and soon makes 
sufficient juice to allow frequent bast- 
ing. To ascertain if done, press with the 
fingers or stick with a fork; the .juice 
will spurt out, and it is then ready to 
serve. Decorate the bone with a quilling 
of white paper, and serve in its own 
sauce. The dish on which mutton is 
placed must always be very hot, as also 
the plates on which it is to be served. 

A very nice way to serve it, and one 
generally used by the Creoles, is <-0 put 
a circle of nicely-boiled ana browned 
turnips around the dish, and serve with 
the gravy of the mutton. 

Boast Saddle of Mutton. 

Selle de Mouton Rotie. 

A Saddle of Mutton. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

Currant Jelly. 



A Saddle of Mutton is two loins. Pro- 
ceed to roast in exactly the same manner 
as for a single leg. S'erve with Currant 
Jelly. 

Boast Loin of Mutton. 

Filet de Mouton Roti. 
A Filet of Mutton. 
Salt and Pepper to Taste. 
Garnish of Green Peas. 
The filet of mutton is a square out 
from the loin. Proceed to dredge with 
salt and pepper, and roast in exactly the 
same manner as leg of mutton. The Cre- 
oles serve the filet very often with a 
garnish of green peas (Petit Pois) piled 
around. 

Bailed Leg of Mutton, Caper Sauce. 

Gigot de Mouton Bouilli, Sauce aux 
Capres. 

1 Leg of Mutton. 1 'Herb Bouquet. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

A Caper Sauce. 

Rub the leg of mutton well with salt 
and pepper. Have ready a pot of boiling 
water, into which you have thrown the 
herbs, bay leaf, salt and pepper, allow- 
ing a teaspoonful each of the two latter 
ingredients. Put the leg of mutton into 
the water being very careful to have it 
well covered with water, else the meat 
will blacken. Let it boil gently, but 
steadily, allowing fifteen minutes to 
every pound of meat. When done, place 
on a dish and serve with a Caper Sauce. 
In serving slice nicely and put a few 
drops of lemon on each slice, and pour 
over the Caper Sauce. (See recipe Caper 
Sauce.) Mutton thus prepared is also 
served with a Puree of Turnips. 

Mutton Stew. 

Ragout de Mouton aux Pommes de Terre. 

4 Pounds of the Brisket of Mutton. 

6 Irish Potatoes. 

3 Large Onions. 1 Bay Leaf. 

1-2 Clove of Garlic. 

1-4 Tablespoonful of Lard. 

2 Quarts of Water. 

1 Square Inch of Ham, Chopped Very 

Fine. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

Cut the mutton into pieces of about 
an inch square and season well with salt 
and pepper. Put one-quarter of a table- 
spoonful of lard into the ^gtewpot, and 
when it melts add the thinlysliced onions. 
Let these brown for a few minutes and 
then add the mutton and the ham, 
chopped very fine. Let this continue 



64 



browning, and when slightly browned 
add one tablespoonful of finely sifted 
flour and stir well. Then add the finely - 
minced bay leaf and a half clove of gar- 
lic, minced fine. Brown lightly, for a 
mutton stew must never be dark. After 
twenty minutes, add two quarts of boil- 
ing water and let it boil for about ten 
minutes longer, seasoning to taste. Then 
add the potatoes, cut into halves, and let 
the mixture cook for three-quarters of an 
hour longer, making one hcur and a half 
in all. Let it simmer gently all the time, 
so that the meat may be perfectly tender. 
Mutton Stew With Turnips. 
Ragouts de Mouton aux Navets. 
4 Pounds of the Brisket of Mutton. 
6 Turnips. 3 Large Onions. 
1 Bay Leaf. 1-2 Clove of Garlic. 
1-4 Tablespoonful of Lard. 
2 Quarts of Water. 
1 Square Inch of Ham, Chopped Very 
Fine. 
Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

Cut the mutton into pieces of about 
an inch in length and thickness, and 
season well. Proceed to make the stew 
as mentioned above, only instead of ad- 
ding potatoes, add turnips parboiled, and 
cut into halves or quarters. This is a 
very delicious stew. The neck of the 
mutton may also be used for stews, but 
preferably the brisket. 

Shoulder of Mutton Smothered With 
Tamlps. 

Epaule de Mouton Braisee. 

1 Shoulder of Mutton.

tender the process of smothering it will 
make it so. It is well to beat the leg 
well with a rolling pin, and you will be 
sure of good and tender eating. Season 
well. Slice an onion and one carrot very 
fine; chop fine a half stalk of celery, 
and put these, with the shoulder of mut- 
ton, into a deep baking pot. Cover weU 
and let the mutton juice permeate the 
vegetables and brown them. Then add 
the minced bay leaves and cloves; cover 
and let these brown, and after ten min- 
utes add one quart of boiling water. 
Season well again, and set on a steady 
fire, allowing fifteen minutes to every 
pound. An hour before serving add six 
whole turnips, which have been peeled 
and parboiled, and let these remain 
smothered with the mutton. S'erve wiiU 
the turnips as a garnish. This dish is 
highly recommended. 

Broiled Mutton Chops. 

Cotelettes de Mouton Grillees et Panees. 

6 Mutton Chops. 

Butter. Salt and Pepper. 

In selecting mutton chops for broilinfr, 
remember that the smaller French chops, 
which are cut from the breast of the 
mutton, are generally served at dinner, 
and the loin chops for breakfast. The 
breast chops are daintier in appearance, 
but the loin chops are sweeter and the 
meat is niore solid. The French chop.s 
should always be cut thinner than the 
loin chops. 

Season the chops well with -salt an'l 
pepper and brush with melted butter and 
a few bread crumbs. Have the grldtron 
very hot and place the chops upon it 
In a few seconds turn the cho-p and let 
this side cook. The blood will be run- 
ning out, and the chop is done. Place 
on a platter, butter thickly and sprinkle 



with chopped parsley and serve very 
hot. 

Mutton Cutlets. 

Cotelettes de Mouton, 

4 Mutton Cutlets. 
Butter. Salt and Pepper. 

The cutlets are slices from the thick 
part of the leg of the mutton and are 
very excellent eating. Trim off the outer 
skin and broil in the same manner as 
mutton chops. They are very delicious 
served for dinner with a garnish of Puree 
of Spinach. (See recipe.) 

Mutton Chops, Brewer's Style, 

Cotelettes de Mouton a. la Brasseur. 

6 Mutton Chops. 2 Tablespoonfuls of 

Butter. 

Juice of Lemon. 

3 Shallcts, Chopped Fine. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

iS'elect six thick chops from the loin cf 
the mutton. Trim neatly and season 
well with salt and black pepper and a 
dash of Cayenne. Rub lightly with but- 
ter on either side and broil on a hot 
charcoal fire. Have ready a hot dish and 
pour over the chops a sauce of melted 
butter, seasoned nicely with salt and 
pepper, the juice of one lemon and thrts 
minced shallots. Serve hot. 

Mutton Hash. 

Hachis de Mouton. 

3 Cups of Hashed Mutton. 

6 Potatoes. 1 Herb Bouquet. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

1 Tablespoonful of Lard or Butter. 

This is a splendid way of utilizing tUe 
left-over mutton. After having taken off 
all the rough edges c-f the roast and cut 
out the gristle and hard membrane, hash 
the mutton into pieces of about one inch 
in size. Take six left-over tomatoes, or 
freshly boiled, and cut into quarters. 
Chop fine one herb bouquet. Place a 
tablespoonful of butter or a half table- 
spoonful of lard into the stewpot, and as 
it melts add the mutton seasoned weU, 
and a few^ minutes later the fine herbs 
Mince the clove of garlic if the flavor 
is liked and add. Stir constantly without 
browning much, and add a tablespoonful 
of flour. Let this brown very slightly 
and then add the tomatoes. Cover and 
let all simmer for about twenty minutes, 
and then pour over a pint of boiling wa- 
ter. Season again to taste and set back 
on the stove and let it simnaer gently for 
about three-quarters of an hour. Cut 
some Croutons and fry them in butter; 
place on a dish and serve with the hash. 
The Creoles often add several poached 
eggs if the sauce is not thick enough. 
It is also a frequent custom to add a 
quarter or a half can of mushrooms to 
the hash, but this is always a matter of 
taste and economy. 

Mutton Fe«t a la Ponlette.

move every vestige of wool that may 
adhere, cleaning and scraping the feet. 
Then place them in a pot. cover well 
with boiling water, add half a lemon (in- 



65 



eluding peel and meat) to the water, and 
salt well. In the meantime, prepare a 
Sauce a la Poulette as follows: Make a 
Cream Sauce (see recipe Meat Sauces) 
and add the juice of one lemon, or halt 
a tablespoonful of good vinegar. Take 
the mutton feet out of the water in 
which they have been boiled, take out 
the big bones from the feet. Put the 
mutton feet into the Sauce a la Poulette, 
add a gill of water, let all simmer about 
five minutes, and then take off the fire 
and add the yolks of two eggs, beaten 
well, stirring well Into the sauce. Serve 
hot. Many of the Creoles add a half can 
of mushrooms to the mutton feet before 
putting in the sauce. This makes the 
dish very delicious, increasing the flavor.

juice of a lemon, let it simmer gently 
for about a half hour, turning the veal, 
that it may cook well and be thoroughly 
penetrated by the juices. Put the stuffed 
mutton feet on top, cover closely, and 
let all simmer for a half hour longer. 
Then unsew the mutton feet, lay them 
on the slices of veal, garnish nicely and 
serve with a Sauce a I'Bspagnole, Sauce 
aux" Tomates, a S'auce aux Ognons, or

I.AMB. 
Agneau. 

Lamb is in season from April to Sep- 
tember. Like very yc-ung veal, it is un- 



66 



wholesome and tasteless if eaten too 
young. A lamb should always be two 
months old, else it will be what the Cre- 
oles call "une viande gelalneuse," or a 
jelly meat not fit to eat and very diffi- 
cult to manage. The best way to cook 
lamb is to roast it or bake it. The loin 
of the lamb is cut into chops; the brains, 
tongue, cutlets, tendons and feet are 
cooked in the same manner as those of 
sheep, and it would be superfluous to re- 
peat the recipes. Stewed Lambs' Ton- 
gues, or "Langues d'Agneau Saute," 
served with a Sauce Tomate, or a Sauce 
a la Tartare, is an excellent entree, or 
luncheon dish. 

Boast I^amb, Mint Sauce. 

Quartier d'Agneau Roti, Sauce Menthe 

The (Hind Quarter of a Lamb. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

Parsley to Garnish. Mint Sauce. 

This is the standing dish for the Easter 
dinner in New Orleans. Select a fint*. 
fresh, white hind-quarter of lamb. Roast 
in exactly the same manner as indicated 
In "Roast Leg of Mutton" (see recipe), 
only allow about twenty minutes to the 
pound in cooking. Serve with garnish of 
parsley and a Mint Sauce. (See recipe.) 
Roast L/amb is always served with 
fresh, young green peas and asparagus 
tips. 

Boast Lamb a la Bearnaise. 

Agneau Roti a. la Bearnaise. 

The Hind Quarter of a Lamb. 

3 Sprigs Each of Thyme, Parsley and 

Bay Leaf. 

6 Minced Shallots. 

1 Tablespoonful of Butter. 

1 Cup of Grated Bread Crumbs. 

The Juice of 1 Lemon. 

Parsley and Sliced Lemon to Garnish. 

Select a fine, white hind-quarter of the 
lamb; lard it in the same manner as 
given for larding "Roast Filet of Beef." 
(See recipe.) Rub well with butter on 
top and sprinkle over thickly with the 
soft of bread crumbs, minced parsley, 
thyme, bay leaf, salt and pepper and 
minced shallots. Set in the stove and 
cover with a buttered brown paper. Let 
it roast, allowing eighteen or twenty 
minutes to the pound, in a quick oven 
and, when done, take off the paper, 
sprinkle again lightly with grated bread 
crumbs; let it brown and set in a hot 
dish; sprinkle over with lemon juice; 
garnish the dish with sprigs o-f parsley 
and sliced lemon, and serve, carving in 
slices and placing a quarter of a lemon 
on each plate. 

Filet of Lanob Boasted and Larded. 

Filet d'Agneau Roti et Pique. 

A Filet of Lamb. 

Lard Sufficient to Lard Thoroughly. 

1 Small Onion. 1 Bay Leaf. 

4 Cloves, if desired. 

1 1-2 Tablespoonfuls of Butter. 

1 Tablespoonful of GJace. (See recipe.) 

1 Glass of Madeira or Sherry Wine, or 

Water. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

Trim the filet nicely, remO'ving the 
outer muscular skin. Lard the filet well, 
using larding needles. The lard must be 
very thin, like a shoestring. The larding 
is done by filling the needles with the 
lard and pushing them through the filet 
as far as they will go. If the needles 
are long enough they will come out on 
the other side of the filet, leaving the 
lard within. Repeat this process all down 



the center and along the sides of tho 
filet, about an inch apart, and have the 
rows neat and even. If you have not a 
larding needle, make incisions with a 
knife and push the lard in with your 
finger, but the filet is never as juicy and 
tender, nor does it look so clean aiid 
even when baked. When well larded, 
dredge well with salt and pepper, rub- 
bing this thoroughly into the beef. Cut 
up one small onion, one bay leaf, and 
mash four cloves, and place in the bot- 
tom of the baking pan. Lay the larded 
filet on this bed, the larded side being 
uppermost. Put small bits of butter equal 
to a half teaspoonful on top, and bake 
in a quick oven thirty minutes. This 
dish is always eaten rare. To ascertain 
if sufficiently done, stick a fork into the 
filet; if the blood bubbles out, it is 
ready to serve. The meat, when done, 
Is always spongy and elastic to the 

tOTICh. 

In the meantime, prepare the follow- 
ing Brown Sauce: Take one tablespoon- 
ful of butter and one of Glace (see recipe 
under chapter "Sauces for Meats, Fish, 
etc.") and three of water, smoothly 
rubbed, and melt in a saucepan, stirring 
constantly to prevent burning. When 
brown, add one glass o< Madeira or 
Sherry wine and a half cup of water. 
S'eason well with salt and pepper. Pour 
over the filet, which must be placed In 
a hot dish, and serve with fresh, young 
green peas. 

Filet of Lamb n la Bechamel.

(See recipe.) Slice the lamb and pour 
over the sauce and serve. This is con- 
sidered an excellent entree.

Du Cochon. 



The old Creoles, like their French an- 
cestors, hold that every portion of the 
hog is good, from the head to the feet, 
and all portions are utilized in the va- 
rious dishes which are so delightfully 
prepared in New Orleans. For roasting, 
the Creoles always use the delicate 
"Cochon de Lait," or suckling pig, if not 
more nor less than four or five weeks 
old, when the pig is roasted whole; 
otherwise the best parts of the grown 
hog for roasting are the loin and the 
leg. Pork chops or cutlets are taken 
from the loin. They are used as entrees, 
as are also slices of cold ham; the kid- 
neys, cooked in wine, and the tails brais- 
ees, or smothered. 

Pork must always be cooked well done, 
or else it will be dangerous, unwhole- 
some and indigestible. It must be roast- 
ed or fried. The Creoles will never eat 
a broiled pork chop. 

Boast Loin of Pork. 

Longe de Pore Rotle. 

A Loin of Pork. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

Parsley to Garnish. Apple Sauce. 

Score the loin in close lines across and 
down. The lines should be about a haif 
Inch apart. Dredge well with salt and 
pepper and place in the oven, letting it 
cook slowly and long, allowing at leant 
twenty-five minutes to every pound, anu 
basting every five minutes for the first 
half hour and every ten minutes there- 
after. Pork must always be well dono. 



When cooked thoroughly, take out of the 
baking pan, put in a hot serving dish, 
and garnish nicely with parsley. Serve 
with Apple Sauce and a little horse- 
radish. (See recipe "Sauces for Meats,"' 
etc.. 

Boast Fork, 

Pore Roti. 

The leg and shoulder may be roasted 
in the same manner as the loin, allow- 
ing from twenty to twenty-five minutes 
to a pound in cooking. 

Boast Pig Stuffed. 

Cochon de Lait Roti et Flarcl. 

1 Pig, Four or Five Weeks Old. 

3 Large Onions. 2 Cups of Bread Oumbs. 

S Sprigs of Chopped Parsley. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

2 Ounces of Butter. 

2 Teaspoonfuls of Powdered Sage. 

3 Hard-Boiled Eggs. 
1 Herb Bouquet. 

In New Orleans the pig is always sold 
killed and cleaned by the butcher. Wash 
the young pig well, cleaning again, and 
scraping thoroughly and taking out all 
remaining hair from the ears and nos- 
trils. Wash again thoroughly in cold 
water, inside and out, shaking the pig 
vigorously, head downward. 'Then turn 
upwards and pour cold water over it. 
Wipe dry inside and out with a coarse 
towel, and then rub well Inside with salt 
and pepper and minced parsley, thyme 
and bay leaf. Prepare a dressing as fol- 



69 



lows: Wet the bread crumbs and squeeze 
thoroughly. Then add the sprigs of 
minced parsley and hard-boiled eggs and 
the powdered sage. Mix well. Season 
all highly with black pepper and salt, 
using about a teaspoonful of salt and a 
half teaspoonful of black pepper. Place 
two ounces of butter, which will be equal 
to two tablespoonfuls, in a frying pan 
on the stove, and, when it melts, add 
the minced onions. Let them brown, and 
then add the dressing, stirring well, and 
letting it fry for five minutes. Take o££ 
and stuff the pig and sew up the open- 
ing. Truss the fore legs forward and th3 
hind feet forward, and close under the 
body. Wipe the pig carefully with a 
damp towel, and then place a corn cob in 
its mo'uth to keep it open. Rub the pig 
all over the outside with butter, dredging 
lightly with salt and pepper. Place in a 
moderate oven, and bake steadily for 
two and a half or three hours, accord- 
ing to size and age. Baste frequently, 
and, when half done, rub again with but- 
ter until the pan is saturated. Continue 
basting at intervals. When done, take 
out of the oven and place on a ho>t dish. 
Garnish the dish with parsley. Take the 
corncob out of the mouth and place in- 
stead a nice, rosy apple. Serve very hot. 
with Apple Sauce. (S'ee recipe "Sauces 
for Meats," etc.) 

Sweet potatoes are a nice vegetable to 
serve with roast pig. Boil a half dozen 
first and then peel carefully and placa 
them whole, about fifteen minutes be- 
fore serving the pig in the pan where it 
is roasting; let them soak in the gravy, 
brown nicely and serve on a separate 
platter or as a garnish. 

Roast Spare Bibs. 

Cotelettes de Pore Roti. 

Spare Ribs. Salt and Pepper to Taste. 
A Garnish of Parsley and Radish. 

Dredge the spare ribs lightly with salt 
and pepper, after having washed well 
and wiped dry with a coarse towel. Place 
them in the baking pan and dredge with 
butter; place them in the oven and cover 
with a piece of buttered paper. Allow 
twenty minutes to every pound in cook- 
ing. About twenty minutes before serv- 
ing take off the buttered paper, dredge 
again, with melted butter, and let it 
brown nicely. Serve with a garnish of 
parsley and radishes. 

If it is desired to stuff the spare ribs, 
have the ribs cracked, crosswise, the 
entire length, in two places. Put a stuff- 
ing, as for roast pig, in the center, or 
a stuffing made of mashed potatoes and 
three hard-boiled eggs, mixed thorough- 
ly. Close the ends of the ribs over this, 
tie well and roast as for a roast pig. 
Serve with an Apple Sauce or a Sauce 
Piquante. (S'ee recipes "Sauces for 
Meats," etc.) 

Pork Tenderloins. 
Filet de Pore Saute. 

4 Pork Tenderloins. 
A Tablespoonful of Lard. 
Salt and Pepper to Taste. 
Have the tenderloins cut thin and split 
lengthwise without separating. Season 
well with salt and pepper. Have ready 
a very hot frying pan, place a table- 
spoonful of butter or lard within and 
add the tenderloins. Turns every two min- 
utes, not leaving them very long on 
either side at a time. Be careful to 
cook through and throoigh, smothering 
over a low fire, and serve with Apple 
Sauce or Currant Jelly. (See recipes 
"/Sauces for Meats," etc.) 



i^'ried Pork Chops. 

Cotelettes de Cochon a la Poele. 

6 or 8 Pork Chops. 

Grated Bread Crumbs. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

Wash the pork chops and season well 
with salt and pepper. Roll in grated

Stuffed Pig's Feet a la Perigueux. 

Pieds de Cochon a la Perigueux. 

3 Pig's Feet. 2 Minced Truffles. 

1-2 Glass of Madeira Wine. 

1 Pound of Boned Turkey Forcemeat, 

6 Pieces of Crepinette. 

1 Egg. 2 Ounces of Butter. 

1-2 Pint of Hot Perigueux Sauce. 

Boil the Pig's Feet, and then split them 
in two; take out the bones, lay the flesh 
on a dry, clean cloth and wipe well 
Make a forcemeat of boned turkey (see 
recipe under chapter Stuffings for Fowls, 
etc.); add the truffles, which have been 
finely minced, and a half glass of Ma- 
deira or Sherry wine. Mix this well to- 
gether. Crepinette is applied to a skin 
found in the stomach of the pig. Take 
six pieces of this crepinette, which you 
will have secured from the butcher; cut 
them the size of a man's hand and lay 
on a clean biscuit board; place on each 
piece of skin a portio^n of the forcemeat 
about the size of a hen's egg and flatten 
out well. Place one-half of a pig's foot 
on top of this farcie, and cover with 
another layer of the stuffing. On either 
side lay three thin slices of truffle.-s. 
Wrap the crepinettes up in some fanciful 
shape, such as an envelope or card case, 
and dip them separately in a well-beate.i 
egg, and then in grated bread crumbs. 
Put two- tablespoonfuls of butter in a 
saucepan or deep frying pan, cover close- 
ly, and let the feet cook on a slow fire 
for twenty-five minutes, allowing twelve 
minutes and a half to each side. Serve 
with a pint of hot Perigueux Sauce. (See 
recipe.) Place the sauce in a dish, lay 
the feet neatly over it, and send to tli« 
table hot. 

Stuffed Pig's Feet, Madeira Sauce. 

Pieds de Cochon a la Sauce Madere. 

Prepare the feet in exactly the same 
manner as indicated in the recipe given 
above, and serve with a pint of hot Ma- 
deira Sauce, instead of the Sauce Peri- 
gueux. 

Hogshead Cheese. 

Fromage de Cochon. 
1 Hog's Head. 1 Lemon. 
1 Glass of" Sherry or Madeira. 2 Onions. 
1 Slice of Ham. 
Thyme, Bay Leaf, Spices. 
Boil the whole of the hog's head, which 
has been well cleaned and scraped. Add 
four teaspc-onfuls of salt, and a lemon 
cut in half. After four hours, when the 
head will have become very tender, takfe 
out of the water and set to cool. Then 
skin the meat from the head. Preserve 
the water in which it has been boiled. 
Cut up the entire head, ears and tongue 
and two of the feet, if you have boiled 
them, too, into pieces of about one inch 
in length. Take two large onions and 
chop them very fine. Put a tablespoon- 
ful of lard and the onions into a pot. 
Don't let them brown, but slightly smoth- 
er. Season well with minced thyme, 
three mashed cloves, a dash of red pep- 
per (Polvre Rouge). Add a teaspoonful 
of water taken from the reserve in which 
the head was boiled. Let this simmer. 
gently; then add one pint of the water, 
the peel of a large lemon, cut fine, and 
one glass of STierry or Madeira. Add 
hot pepper to taste, seasoning highlv. 
Boil well. Then add the head and 'a 
slice of ham, cut into pieces of about 
one inch long and a half inch wide. 
Season to taste, and add five powdered 
allspice, one blade of chopped mace and 
three mashed cloves. Let it boil for n 
half hour longer, till it comes to the 



right consistency. When cooked, fill a 
bowl with the cheese and put a close- 
fitting dish on top, and then place a 
piece of plank over this and set a big 
weight of about fifteen pounds or three 
or four flatirons on top. When the cheese 
cools, which will be in about five or six 
hours, turn out of the bowl. It will have 
taken the shape of the bowl and become 
a fine head of cheese, ready to be served. 
This is the Creole's way of making ho-gs- 
head cheese, and it cannot be improved 
upon. 

Salt Meat. 

Viande Salee. 

Salt pork enters so largely into cook- 
ing that it will be unnecessary to devot2 
special attention to it here. It is useJ 
in cooking cabbage and pork and beans — 
a most excellent dish for children — and 
with nearly all green herbs and vegeta- 
bles it serves as a delightful flavor. In 
the chapter on vegetables, wherever it is 
advisable to use salt or pickled pork, 
this subject will be treated. 

Pickled Pork. 

Petit Sale. 

Coarse Salt Sufficient to Make a Brine. 

12 Bay Leaves. 2 Dozen Onions. 

25 Pounds of Pork. 1 Ounce of Saltpetre. 

12 Cloves. 6 Allspice. 

Pork should be pickled about twenty 
hours after killing. It is pickled always 
in sufficient quantity to last for some 
time, for, if proper care is taken, it wiU 
keep one year after pickling; but it may 
also be pickled in smaller quantities, of 
three or four pounds at a time, reducing 
other ingredients in the recipe according 
to quantity of pork used. To twenty- 
five pounds of pcTk allow one ounce of 
saltpetre. Pulverize thoroughly and mix 
with a sufficient quantity of salt to thor- 
oughly salt the pork. Cut the pork into 
pieces of about two pounds, and slash 
each piece through the skin, and then 
rub thoroughly with the salt and salt- 
petre mixture till the meat is thorough- 
ly penetrated through and through. Mash 
the cloves very fine and ground the all- 
spice. Chop the onions. Take a small 
barrel and place at the bottom a layer 
of salt, then a layer of coarsely chopped 
onions, and sprinkle over this a layer of 
the spices and minced bay leaves. Place 
on this a layer of the pork; pack tight- 
ly; then place above this a layer of the 
salt and seasonings and continue with 
alternate layers of pork and seasonings 
till all the pork is used up. Conclude 
with a layer of the minced herbs and 
spices and have a layer of salt on top. 
Cover the preparation with a hoard on 
which a heavy weight must be placeii 
to press down the meat. It will be ready 
for use in about ten or twelve days. 

HAM. 

Jambon. 

Ham is one of the most useful articles 
of supply that can be kept in any house- 
hold. The Creoles generally keep a nice- 
ly boiled ham on hand. In case of un- 
expected company for lunch or supper, 
the ham is always ready and sure to be 
appetizing. It forms combinations in 
many dishes, and is in itself a delightful 
breakfast dish and dinner entree. 

Fried Ham. 

Jambon Bouilll. 

A tHam, 2 Blades of Mace. 

1 Dozen Cloves. 4 Bay Leaves. 

Black Pepper and Parsley to Garnish. 



71 



Wash the ham well in cold water, 
scraping off all portions of mold or salt. 
Have a large boiler of water on the 
stove; or, better still, the furnace. Throw 
in two blades of mace, a dozen cloves 
and three or four bay leaves. Put the 
ham in the water and let the fire be 
slow, allowing the water to heat grad- 
ually. Do not permit it to come to a 
good boil for two hours at least, and be 
Careful to skim carefully, so that all re- 
jected substances may not impregnate 
the ham. . Keep it simmering gently, al- 
lowing twenty minutes to every pound. 
When done, let the ham cool in its own 
liquor, and then put the ham on a board, 
cover with another board, and lay a 
weight over. Leave under weight sev- 
eral hours. This will enable you to cut 
the ham in thin slices after removing the 
weight. Then carefully remove the skin 
without taking off the fat. Sprinkle it 
in patches with black pepper and orna- 
ment the shank bone with quilled paper, 
or a paper frill. Serve it cold with a 
garnish of parsley. Cold boiled ham 
should be sliced very thin and served 
with pickles and mustard. 

Fried Ham. 

Jamb on Frit. 

8 Thin Slices of Ham. 

Pepper to Taste. 

Parsley to Garnish. 

Slice the ham thin. Heat the frying 
pan very hot. Lay in the ham in its 
own fat and fry over a quick fire. Tbe 
Creoles serve eggs, nicely fried, with 
ham. Allow an egg fo every slice oi 
ham. After taking the ham out of the 
pan, drop in the eggs. If you do not 
like eggs fried on both sides (many pre- 
fer them so), baste the eggs with the hot 
grease, and be sure to cook the yolks 
whole. When they are well set, without 
being hard, take the eggs out and lay one 
on each slice of ham. Garnish with 
parsley. Sprinkle the eggs with salt and 
pepper very lightly and serve. This is a 
very p6-pular Creole breakfast dish. 

If eggs are not served with the fried 
ham, and a gravy is desired, make one 
as follows : Take one tablespoonful of 
flour and add to the remaining fat in the 
pan. Mix well until smooth. Add a hall 
pint of milk and stir until it boils; throw 
in a dash of black pepper, pour over the 
ham and send to the table hot. 

Broiled Ham. 

Jambon Grille. 

6 or 8 Thin Slices of Boiled Ham. 
6 or 8 Slices of Buttered Toast. 
Always use boiled ham for broiling. 
Slice it about a half inch thick, accord- 
ing to the number to be served, and trim 
off the rough edges. Have the broiler 
very hot, lay the slices of ham upon it 
and brown well. Serve with buttered 
toast. 

Broiled Ham With Cucumber Garnish. 

Jambon Grille aux Concombres. 

6 or 8 Slices of Boiled Ham. 
Pepper. Cucumbers. 

Cut thin as many slices of ham as de- 
sired and broil evenly over hot coals. 
When well brown butter, add pepper, 
sprinkling, and serve with slices of cu- 
cumber that have been steeped in salted 
vinegar several hours ranged around it. 



Ham Croquettes. 

Croquettes de Jambon. 

2 Cups of Finely Chopped Boiled Ham. 
2 Cups of Mashed Potatoes. 

The Yolks of 3 Eggs. 

2 Tablespoonfuls of Cream. 

2 Tablespoonfuls of Butter. 

A Dash of Cayenne. 

Chop the ham fine and add to the 
mashed potatoes. Then add the cream 
and butter and the yolks of two eggs, 
beaten well. Beat all together until 
smooth, then add a dash of Cayenne- 
Mold the ham into cylinder shapes of 
about a finger in length and roll in the 
beaten egg that remains. Then roll in 
bread crumbs grated and fry in the boil- 
ing fat. 

Ham puffs are made in the same way, 
only the potatoes are omitted, and a 
stiff batter is used instead, made of one 
pint of flo'ur and one of water, three 
eggs and four ounces of finely chopped 
ham. The ham is placed in the batter 
and fried in boiling lard to a golden 
brown. 



Ham Souffle. 



Souffle de Jambon. 



1 Cup of Minced iHam. 

3 Eggs, Beaten With the Whites and 

Yolks Separate. 

1 Teaspoonful of Finely Chopped 

Parsley. 

Pepper to Taste. 

Mix together the chopped parsley, ham 
and yolks of eggs and a dash of Ca 
yenne pepper. Beat all very hard till it 
becomes light. Then add the whites of 
the eggs, which have been beaten to a 
froth. Beat together sufficiently to mix 
well. Fill a dish and bake in an oven 
for eight or ten minutes and serve with 
a Cream Sauce. (See recipe.) 

Boiled Bacon. 

Petit Sale Bouilli. 

Proceed in exactly the' same manner 
as for boiled ham. 

Fried Bacon. 

Petit Sale Frit. 

Cut intC' very thin slices, put in the 
frying pan and fry to a nice golden 
brown. This is a fine breakfast dish. 

Creole Sausage. 

Sauoisses a la Creole. 

It has been said by visitors to New 
Orleans that the Creoles excell ,all other 
cooks in preparing appetizing sausages 
From the old Creole negresses, who go 
about the streets in the early morning 
crying out "Belles Saucisses!" "Belle 
Chaurice!" tc the "Boudins" and "Sau- 
cissons" so temptingly prepared by the 
Creole butchers in the French Market, 
the Creole sausage enters largely into 
domestic cooking and forms a delightful 
flavor for many dainty dishes, especial- 
ly of the vegetable order, while in the 
preparation of the famous "Jambalaya," 
the "Chaurice" is one of the mc-st neces- 
sary and indispensable ingredients. 



11 



Chaurice. . 

4 Pounds of Lean, Fresh Pork. 

2 Pounds of Fat Fresh Pork. 

2 Large Onions, Minced Very Fine. 

1 Clove of Garlic, Minced Very Fine, 
1 Teaspoonful of Cayenne Pepper and 

Chili Pepper (very hot). 

1 Teaspoonful of Red Pepper. 

3 Teaspc'onfuls of Salt. 

2 Teaspoonfuls of Finely Ground Black 

Pepper. 
1 Sprig of Thyme, Well Minced. 

3 Sprigs of Parsley, Finely Minced. 

2 Bay Leaves, Chopped or Minced Very 

Fine. 
1-2 Teaspoonful of Allspice, Very Fine. 

Hash the pork as fine as possible — fat 
and lean — and mix together. Then season 
highly with the salt and black pepper 
and Cayenne, Chili and red pepper (pi- 
mento) . This high seasoning distin- 
guishes the Creole sausage frc-m all oth- 
ers. Chaurice must be seasoned very 
hot, so do not fear to have too much 
red pepper. Mince the onion and garlic 
as fine as possible, then add to the Chau- 
rice. Mince the herbs as fine as pos- 
sible, and add, and then mix the finely 
ground spices thoroughly with the Chau- 
rice. Hash all together, and when well 
mixed, take the casings (the Creoles al- 
ways use the entrails of the sheep for 
this purpose) that have been well cleaned 
by the butcher. Scald them and wash 
thoroughly again. Dry them and fill 
with the mixture, tying them in the 
lengths you desire. 

Chaurice is fried in boiling lard for 
breakfast, always having sufficient to 
have the sausage swim in it, and served, 
after draining of all grease, on a hot 
dish with minced parsley thrown over 
as a garnish. It is used most extensive- 
ly in making "Jambalaya," and a few 
Chaurice thrown into the pc-t of boiling 
cabbage or beans add greatly to the 
flavor. This is a distinctive Creole sau- 
sage and the very nicest and most 
highly flavored that can be eaten. 

Chaurice With Puree of Potatoes. 

Chaurice a la Puree de Pommes de Terre. 

2 Pounds of Chaurice. 
4 Irish Potatoes. 1 Egg, Well Beaten. 

Prick the sausages and lay them in 
the bottom of a pan. Make a soft Puree 
of Potatoes (see recipe) and pour this 
over the sausage. Then spread a beaten 
egg very evenly on top, sprinkle with 
bread crumbs, and place in the oven and 
let it bake a half hour. This is a nice 
breakfast or luncheon dish. 

Chaurice With Creole Sauce. 

Chaurice, Sauce a la Creole. 

2 Pounds of Chaurice (about 6 to a 

pound). 

1 Clove of Minced Garlic. 

1-2 Can of Tomatoes. 1 Teaspoonful of 

Salt. 

1 Teaspoonful of Black Pepper, 

1 Large Onion. 1-2 Spocn of Lard. 

Place a half teaspoonful of lard in the 
frying pan or stewpan, and when it 
heats add the chopped onion. Let this 
'brown slightly and then add the minced 
garlic. Then add the half can of toma- 
toes. As this browns put in the sausa^^e 
which you have pricked gently. Cover 
and let them simmer for about five min- 
utes, then add the seasonings to taste. 
Add about a half cup of boiling water. 
Cover well and let all simmer for twenty 
minutes longer. This is very nice for 
breakfast. 



SauciBses. 

Saucisses, unlike Chaurice, are madd 
from pork and beef mixed. Take 

2 Pounds of Lean Beef. 
2 Pounds of Lean Pork. 

1 Pound of Lean Veal. 1 Pound of Fat 
Pork. 

2 Large Onions Minced Very Fine. 

2 Cloves of Garlic. 

1 Teaspoonful of Cayenne Pepper. 
1 Tablespoonful of Black Pepper. 

3 Tablespoonfuls of Salt. 

3 Bay Leaves. Minced Very Fine. 
1-2 Spoon Each of Ground Cloves, Mace 

Allspice and Grated Nutmeg. 

1 Teaspoonful Each of Minced Thyme 

and Sweet Marjoram. 

Chop and hash the meat (fat and lean) 
very fine, mincing it, and then season 
highly with salt and pepper and Ca- 
yenne, mixing well. Add the minced 
onion and garlic, mix well, and then add 
the finely minced herbs and spices. Mix 
thoroughly and fill the casings which 
you have gotten from the butcher and 
washed again thoroughly. Fill them with 
the mixture, in lengths of about two feet 
or one foot and a half, stuffing tightly. 
Tie at both ends and let them stand over- 
night in a deep brine. If used for break- 
fast, take out as much as desired, wiDe 
dry and cut into slices and fry, or fry 
the sausage, the whole length, in boil- 
ing lard, and then slice nicely. Garnish 
with chopped parsley and serve. 
Saucissons. 

Saucissons are sausage made from the 
lean, fine flesh of the pork and the filet 
, of beef. Take 

2 Pounds df Fresh Pork, Very Lean. 

1 Pound of Fat. 

2 Pounds of Filet of Beef. 1 I^rge 

Onion. 
1 Teaspoonrul of Cayenne Pepper. 
1 Teaspoonful of Black Pepper. 
3 Teaspoonfuls of Salt. 
1 Bay Leaf, Chopped Fine. 
1-4 Teaspoonful Each of Ground All- 
spice, Cloves, and 1-2 Nutmeg. 
1-2 Teaspoonful Each of Fine Herbs. 
1 Clove of Garlic. 

Mince and hash the meat very fine, 
mixing the beef and pork and fat. Then 
season highly with the Cayenne, salt and 
pepper, mixing thoroughly. Season next 
with the minced onion and garlic; mix 
well, and then with the minced herbs 
and spices, mixing all thoroughly. Fill 
the casings, which are never very large 
for Saucissons. Tie them in sausages of 
about a finger in length, or three inches, 
and they are ready to be cooked. Sau- 
cissons are always fried in boiling lard 
and served whole, placing several ou 
each plate. 

Boudins. 

Boudins are blood sausages and are 
much affected by the Creoles. Take 
1 Pound of Hog or Beef Blood (1 pint). 

1-2 Pound of Hog Fat. 2 Onions. 

Salt, Pepper and Cayenne to Season 

Highly. 

1-2 Clove of Garlic. 

Mince the onions fine and fry them 
slightly in a small piece of the hog fat. 
Add the minced garlic. Hash and mince 
the -remaining fat very fine, and mix it 
thoroughly with the beef blood. Mix the 
onions, and then season highly, adding 
of allspice, mace, clove and nutmeg * 
half teaspoonful each, finely ground, and 
a half teaspoonful each of fine herbs. 
When all mixed, take the prepared cas- 
ings, or entrails, and fill with the mix- 
ture, being careful to tie the sausage 



73 



casing at the further end before attempt- 
ing to fill. Then tie the other end, mak- 
ing the sausage into strings of about 
two feet. Wash them thoroughly on the 
outside after filling, and then tie again 
in spaces of three inches or less in 
length, being careful hot to make too 
long. Place them to cook in a pot of 
tepid water, never letting them boil, as 
that would curdle the bloo'd. Let them 
remain on the slow fire till you can prick 
the sausage with a needle and no blood 
will exude. Then take them out, let them 
dry and cool. 

Boudins are always fried in boiling 
lard. Some broil them, however. 

Boudin Blanc. 

1 Pound of the White Meat of Fowl 
(left over). 

1 Pound of Lean Pork. 1 Pound of 

Fat Pork. 

1 Pint of Cream. 

1-2 Cup of Soft of Bread. 

The Yolks of 2 Eggs. 

1-4 Teaspoon of Ground Spices. 

1-2 Clove of Garlic. 

1 Onion. 1 Teaspoonful Cayenne. 

Salt and Pepper, 1 Teaspoonful Each. 

Cut the meat and mince. Season high- 
ly with the salt and pepper and Cayenne. 
Add the minced onion and garlic. Mix 
well with half a cup of the soft of bread, 
wet and squeezed well. Cook all tor 
about fifteen minutes in one pint of 
cream. When reduced take off the stove, 
add the beaten yolks of two eggs, stir 
well and cool. Fill the prepared entrails 
and tie either end, and place them in a 
pot containing half milk and half water. 
Boil them for about twenty minutes and 
then prick gently, place in buttered pa- 
pers and broil gently. The left-over of 
rabbit, chicken, turkey, partridge and 
other birds may be prepared in this 
manner, as also the left-over of crawfish 
or crabs. This is a Creole hors d'oeuvre. 



Chitterlings. 

Andouilles. 

2 Pounds of Fat Pork. 2 Pounds of Lean 

Pork. 

1 Pound of Inner Lining of Stomach 

of Hog. 

2 Cloves of Garlic. 3 Bay Leaves. 2 

Large Onions. 
1 Tablespoonful Each of Salt and Pepper. 
1 Teaspoonful of Cayenne. 1 Tea- 
spoonful of Chili Pepper. 
1-2 Teaspoonful Each of Mace, Clovoa 

and Allspice, ground fine. 

1 Tablespoonful Each of Minced Thyms, 

Sweet Marjoram and Parsley. 

Select the largest intestines of the hog, 
wash clean, disgorge and thoroughly 
cleanse, and let soak for twenty-four 
hours in fresh water, changing the water 
frequently. Then drain and dry well. 
Cut them into threadlike pieces of about 
■once inch in length, and hash the pork 
lean and fat, together; mix thoroughly 
with the threads of intestines or inner 
stomach of the hog, and season highly 
with the salt, pepper and Cayenne and 
Chili pepper. Mince the onion and gar 
lie and herbs as fine as possible anil 
add to the meat. Add the ground spices 
and mix and hash all together very fine. 
Take six or eight of the large intestines 
that have been thoroughly soaked and 
disgorged and fill these casings with the 
preparation, after scalding and drying 
the casings thoroughly. Tie into the de- 
sired lengths and use as desired. This 
is a very fat sausage and entirely too 
rich for delicate stomachs. When tied 
into large sausages about the size of the 
hand they are called "Andouilles." When 
tied into small sausages they are styled 
"Andouillettes." The latter arc the 
more delicate. This sausage is generally 
served with mashed potatoes, "a puree of 
peas or lentils. The chitterlings are first 
boiled in an aromatic water, with an 
herb 'bouquet, or in milk; they are then 
broiled, or baked in the oven for eight 
or ten minutes. 



CHAPTER XVI. 
POUIiTBT. 



De la Volaille. 



Poultry of all kinds, especially chicken, 
furnishes the good cook with an infinite 
variety of delightful dishes, which 
are dishes that may grace the tabic 
of the people from the simple farmer or 
the Creole in his humble home to the 
rich banker who can afford to serve 
them with truffles and mushrooms. 

Roast chicken, roast turkey, roast 
goose, roast duck are welcome dishes on 
every table. The entrees that are made 
from poultry are various, such as Tur- 
key Daube, Fricassees of Chicken, with 
truffles, mushrooms, green peas, rice; 
Ragouts of Ducks, Chapons au Gros Sel, 
Poulardes a la Sauce Tartare, Poulet 
Saute a la Creole, all manner of cro- 
quettes and salads, and goose entre a la 
Chipolata. Full-grown poultry always 
has the best flavor. 

TURKEY. 

Dinde. 

The turkey hen is called "dinde," the 
turkey gobbler ,"dindon." The prefer- 
ence in eating is always given to the 
"dinde," as the "dindons" never make 
quite such excellent dishes. 

Turkey may be roasted, stewed or 
made into gumbo. Only a very old and 
lean turkey is ever stewed. It is utilized 



in this way as a home dish, never on tha- 
company table. The boned turkey is the 
triumph of the New Orleans cuisine' 
when serving cold turkey. No great re-- 
ception or buffet lunchon is complete 
without it. It is the standing dish on 
New Year's Day, when the Creole ladies 
receive tneir gentlemen friends, and, on 
occasions of marriages in the family, 
every father will insist that there shall 
be a boned turkey for the wedding feast. 
Boast Turkey, 
Dinde Rotie. 

1 Turkey. 2 Tablespoonfuls of Butter, 
S'alt and Pepper to Taste. 
Dressing According to Taste. 
A hen turkey is always best for roast- 
ing. Clean and prepare the turkey. Make 
a nice stuffing either of oysters, egg. 
truffles or chestnuts (see Dressings for 
Fowls). Rub the turkey well with salt 
and pepper inside and out, and then rub 
the inside with butter, using about a 
half tablespO'onful. Stuff first the space 
from which you took out the craw and 
then sew up the slit in the skin, fasten- 
ing the skin by a piece of thread tied 
around the neck or folding it over and 
fastening with a small skewer. Then 
stuff the body of the turkey. Push th» 



74 



legs under the skin near the rump, cros% 
them and fasten them with a 
small skewer or tie with a 
piece of twine. Turn the wings back, 
under the body of the fowl. Rub the 
turkey all over with butter or lard, and 
place in the baking pan that has been 
greased lightly. Bake the turkey in a 
quick oven, allowing about fifteen min- 
utes to every pound. Baste every ten 
minutes or so with its own drippings. 
When done, remove the twine and the 
skewer and place on a hot dish, gar- 
nished nicely with parsley, and serve. 
The turkey breast should always be 
carved in delicate slices. 

In making the dressing of any kind, 
always take up the liver and heart, 
which you have seasoned well and 
minced very fine, and add to the turkey 
dressing and mixing thoroughly. 

Roast Turkey With Truffles. 

Dinde Truffee Rotie. 

1 Fine Young Hen Turkey. 

1 Pound of Lean liTam, Cut into Dice. 

2 Pounds of Truffles. 1-4 Nutmeg. 

1-4 of a Teaspoonful of Pepper. 

1 Bay Leaf, Minced Fine. 
Clean and prepare the turkey for roast- 
ing as directed in the above recipe. Put 
a saucepan on the fire and put in the 
ham cut into dice. When hot add two 
pounds of the very best truffles and the 
grated nutmeg, the pepper and a mincei 
bay leaf. Stir over the fire tor about 
fifteen minutes. Then take off and let 
cool. When it is cold stuff the place at 
the neck of the turkey whence you tako 
the craw, and sew up and arrange as in- 
dicated in the directions for dressing a 
turkey. Stuff the body of the turkey 
with the remainder of the truffles and 
sew it up and truss it. Set it in the even 
and roast according to the above recipe, 
serving with a Sauve aux Truffles. This 
is a very exi>ensive dish. 

Roast Turkey With Mushrooms. 

Dinde Rotie Farcie aux Champignons. 

Proceed in the above manner, substi- 
tuting mushrooms instead. 
Turkey With Chestnuts or Oysters. 

Dinde Rotie Farcie au Marrons ou au> 
Haitres. 
Prepare the turkey in the manner indi- 
cated in "Roast Turkey"; stuff accord- 
ing to taste with either a Chestnut or 
Oyster Dressing (see recipes under chap- 
ter "Stuffings and Dressings for Poul- 
try, Game," etc.) and cook as in recipe 
for "Roast Turkey." Chestnut and Oys- 
ter Stuffings are favorite Creole dress - 
ings for turkeys. 

Turkey en Daube. 

Dinde en Daube. 

1 Large Turkey. 

1 Bunch Each of Parsley, Thyme and 

Small Celery Leaves, 

Large Slice of Salt Pork. 

2 Onions and 2 Carrots, Sliced. 

10 Cloves. 1-2 Calf's Foot. 

1 Clove o-f Garlic. Bouquet of Sweet 

iHerbs. 

1 1-2 Pints of Broth or Boiling Water. 

2 Spoonfuls of Brandy. 
1 Pint of White Wine. 

Clean and prepare the turkey as in the 
above directions, then stuff either with 
egg dressing or oyster stuffing. Rub 
well with salt and pepper. Place at thft 
bottom of a deep pot slender strips of 
salt pc-rk and half of a calf's foot, well 
prepared. Place on top of this the slices 



of onions, carrot, fine herbs, minced 
nicely ; garlic, minced, celery, parsley, 
etc., and lay the turkey on this bed. 
Pour over it one pint of White wine and 
two tableEjpoonfuls of Brandy, and ono 
pint and a half of good broth or boiling 
water. Season well to taste and cover 
tightly. Set on the stove to simmer very 
slowly for at least five hours if the tur- 
key is old. Turn it once very carefully 
when half done cooking. After five 
hours lift the turkey out of the sauce, 
place on a hot dish. Strain the sauce 
through a sieve, and if the turkey is 
served at once, serve hot in a separate 
dish. If not, pour it over the turkey and 
set it away to cool. It will become quite 
jellied and makes an excellent luncheon 
dish. 

Boned Turkey. 

Gelatine Truffee a la Gelee. 

1 Young Turkey Hen, 

2 Pounds of Young Veal. 

1 Pound cf Fat Fresh Pork. 

1 Pound of Lean Fresh Pork. 

1-4 Pound of Cooper's Gelatine. 

1-4 Can of Truffles. 

1 Tablespoonful Each of Minced Parsley 

and Thyme. 

3 Minced Bay Leaves. 1 Lemon. • 

3 Sprigs E>ach of Thyme and Bay Leaf. 

1 Glass of Brandy. , 
1 Wineglass of Sherry. 2 Carrots. 

1 Turnip. 1 Stalk of Celery. 

2 Gallons of Water. 

1-2 Teaspoonful Each of Grated Cinna- 
mon and Allspice. 

For this highly-prized dish, select a 
young hen turkey. It must be hand- 
picked — that is, it must not be scalded, 
or it will be unfit for the purpose of 
boning. Clean it thoroughly, and, when 
well cleansed, place the turkey on the 
table, with the breast down, and take a 
sharp penknife, or a very sharp-pointed 
knife, and cut the turkey open from the 
neck to the rump, down the backbone. 
Then, with great care, run the knife be- 
tween the bones and the flesh to the 
wings, and, on reaching the joint, un- 
joint and separate the bones from the^ 
body without breaking the flesh; in like* 
manner remove each bone as you reach 
the joint, except the small bone in the 
tips of the wings, which cannot be taken 
out easily and which are generally left 
on. Carefully slit out the bones of the 
leg, and then run the knife between the 
bones and flesh till you come to the 
breast bone. Skillfully separate the flesh 
from the bone by running the knife be- 
tween, being careful to pull it out with- 
out breaking the flesh of the turkey. 
After removing the carcass, spread out 
the turkey, which will be whole, anrt 
wipe inside and out with a damp towel, 
and rub well with salt and pepper, in- 
side and out. Set aside in a cool place 
and prepare the following dressing or 
stuffing: Take two pounds of young 
veal, one pound of young, fat, fresh pork, 
and one pound of lean fresh pork. Mince 
these as fine as possible, and then sea- 
son as follows : One-half of a nutmeg, 
finely grated ; tablespoonful of minced 
parsley; one of minced thyme, three of 
minced bay leaves, one teaspoonful of 
salt and one of black pepper, a teaspoon- 
ful of grated cinnamon, one-quarter tea- 
spoonful of grated allspice and the juic3 
of one onion. Mix all this thoroughly 
in the stuffing. Add two raw eggs, beat- 
en weU; one wineglass full of Sherry and 
one of Brandy ; stir well. WTien well 
mixed add one-quarter of a box of truf- 
fles, chopped, but not too fine. Take 



75 



the turkey, lay it open and carefully cut 
a layer of meat in nice slices from the 
inner part. Then put in a thick layer ot 
the stuffing, and lay over this a layer of 
the meat, using the whole liver, sliced 
in strips, also as alternate layers; then 
put in the rest of the stuffing as a layer, 
and bring the turkey nicely together 
and sew up so that It will retain its orig- 
inal shape. 'Have ready a nice, clean 
towel; roll the turkey in the towel, and 
tie it securely at both ends and around 
the middle in a solid way. Take all the 
bones of the turkey, the skinned feet, 
cleaned head and all, and place in a 
large pot. Add two pounds of veal, cut 
In pieces, and two calf's feet. Put in 
two carrots, one turnip, several sprigs of 
thyme and parsley, three bay leaves and 
a large piece of celery. Add two gallons 
of water, and let this boil very hard for 
an hour. Then add the turkey, which 
you will have tied in the towel, and let 
it boil for two hours. After two hours, 
take the turkey out of the towel. It will 
have shrunken up by this time and the 
towel will be crinkled greatly. Roll the 
towel out very smoothly again, and placa 
the turkey back in it while hot, and roll 
carefully again. Tie it at both ends and 
across the middle, and then place on a 
table and put a board or plank on top, 
and over this a fifteen-pound weight. 
Leave it in a cool place, but not in the 
ice box, as it must cool gradually and 
naturally. After it has cooled five or 
six hours you may put it in the ice box. 
In the meantime you will have left on 
the fire the pot with the water, bones, 
etc., in which the turkey has been boiled. 
Let it boil for two hours longer, with the 
bones and all. Then take off and drain 
the whole through a strainer, first let- 
ting the juice fall in another pan; then 
strain this through a towel, for there 
must be no pieces of cinnamon or herbo 
or dregs in this jelly. Skim off all the 
grease that floats on top, being careful 
not to leave a particle. Put it on the 
fire again, and let it simmer. Add to 
the boiling mixture one lemon and skin, 
cut in four or five pieces, and season 
with salt to taste. Put in a bowl one- 
quarter of a pound of gelatine, and add 
one pint of water in which the turkey 
has been boiled; stir well and let the 
gelatine melt. When well melted, pour 
into the boiling mixture and beat it as 
you would a cake, mixing thoroughly. 
Take another bowl, and break three raw 
eggs in it, and mash the shells and add; 
add one small wineglass of water and 
heat well again, as you would a cake. 
Prepare a flannel bag of size sufficient 
to hold a half gallon. Then pour the 
eggs into the broth, beating very thor- 
oughly and rapidly through and through 
for ten minutes, while it remains on the 
fire. The moment it begins to boil up it 
will curdle; then take the mixture off 
and strain in the flannel bag. Let this 
fall into a few tin cups or cans, for they 
are best, and set on ice. The next morn- 
ing it win be hard. Then unroll the tur- 
key and put it in a dish; cut the Jelly 
from the can into fancy shapes and or- 
nament the turkey with it, placing a 
fancy border around the dish. Tou will 
have a dish that a king might envy. 

Boned chicken may be prepared in ex- 
actly the same way. 

CHICKEN. 

Poulet. 

Chickens may be broiled, boiled, fried, 

stewed, baked or smothered. For broU- 

Ing, always purchase spring chickens. 

For baking, the chicken must be young 



and tender. For invalids, a delicately 
boiled spring chicken, with Drawn But- 
ter Sauce, is a most nutritious and easily 
digestible dish. 

Broiled Chicken. 

Poulet Grille. 

A Spring CTiicken. Melted Butter. 
Salt and Pepper to Taste. 
Select spring chickens for broiling. For 
a family of six several will, be required. 
Clean the chickens nicely,' singe, and 
then split down the middle of the back, 
laying the chicken open. Break the 
breastbone with a mallet and flatten out 
the chicken. Season well with salt and 
pepper, and brush with melted butter. 
Have the broiler ready over a moderate 
fire, and place the chicken between (the 
double broiler is best) and let the fowl 
broil slowly for about a half hour, if the 
chicken is very tender, otherwise three- 
quarters of an hour. It is well to keep 
a plate over it all the time, as it will re- 
tain its flavor better. Turn the chicken 
frequently, so that it may be broiled 
through and through. It should be 
slightly browned on the skin side. When 
done, place in a heated dish, pour over 
melted butter and garnish with chopped 
parsley and serve hot. A garnish ot 
cresses is very pretty. The dish is then 
called "Poulet Grille aux Cressons. 
Boiled Chicken. 
Poulet Bouilll. 

A Spring Chicken. Drawn Butter Sauce. 
Salt and Pepper to Taste. 
Select a nice spring chicken, clean and 
singe and split down the middle of the 
back. Season with salt and pepper, rub- 
bing well on the Inside of the chicken. 
Place in a saucepan and cover well with 
water, and let it simmer well for one 
hour if the chicken is young. If the 
chicken is a year old and over, let it 
simmer for two hours, according to age. 
When done take out of the water and 
place in a heated dish. Pour over a 
Drawn Butter Sauce (see recipe) and 
garnish with chopped parsley. 

Creamed Chicken. 

Poulet a la Creme. 

1 Chicken. Salt and Pepper to Taste. 
A Cream Sauce. 

Select a fine one-year-old chicken, and 
clean, singe and boil according to the 
above recipe, first having cut in joints, 
however. In boiling always simply cOTTer 
the chicken with water, otherwise you 
will have chicken soup, all the nutriment 
of the chicken being absorbed by the 
soup. When cooked for an hour or 
longer, if the chicken Is now very ten- 
der, take out of the saucepan and place 
In a dish and pour over a Cream Sauca 
(see recipe), and serve.

tablespoonfuls of vinegar or a winegla.ss 
of White wine. Stir well and add one 
pint cf the water in which the chicke.i 
was boiled. Season with salt and pepper 
to taste and a slight dash of Cayenne. 
Then add one teaspoonful of prepared 
mustard. Let it simmer three mlnutea 
longer, and as it comes to a boil pour 
over the chicken and serve. Any re - 
mains of cold chicken are very delicious 
served with this "Sauce a la Diable. 
(See recipe "Meat Sauces.")

Boil the chicken according to the above 
recipe, adding the chopped vegetables 
and herbs. Season to taste. When done, 
place on a hot dish, butter nicely and 
serve with a Sauce a la Tartare. (See 
recipe.) 

A broiled chicken may be served in 
the same manner, but either broiled or 
boiled, the chicken must be cooked 
whole, splitting down the back. 

Stewed Chicken, Brown Sauce. 

FTricassee de Volaille, Sauce Brune.

brown slightly and then add the flour 
which has been well sifted. Let this 
brown and add the chicken. Let all 
simmer a few minutes and then add the 
■chopped thyme, parsley and bay leaf. 
The latter must be minced very fine. 
;Stir well and often. When every piece is 
■nicely brow^ned, add one pint and a 
half of boiling water or soup broth. Stir 
until it begins to boil. Season again to 
taste. Cover and let it simmier gently for 
an hour, or until tender. In making a 
fricassee, the liver, heart and gizzard of 
the chicken are all thrown into the stew. 
Dish up the chicken, pour over the hot 
sauce and serve hot. This dish is vex'y 
nice with boiled rice or potatoes. It is 
a simple, elegant dish, within the means 
of everyone. This is a plain fricassee. 

Stewed Chicken, White Sauce.

erate fire. Cover well with boiling wa- 
ter. Let simmer for an hour and a half 
or quarter if the chicken is very young; 
longer if the chicken is old. Add tlie 
juice of two large onions. Cook until 



tender. This is the unvarying rule in 
stewing or cooking chickens, as one may 
be tender and the other quite tough, 
though of the same age. When th-> 
chicken is done, blend together one largo 
tablespoonful of butter and of flour in a 
frying pan without browning; add a pint 
of milk and mix well. Add this to the 
chicken, mixing and stirring constantly

Season well with salt and pepper. Put 
two tablespoonfuls of butter into a stew- 
pan, and, when it melts, add the chicken. 
Let this brown slowly for a good five 
minutes. Have ready three large onions 
sliced. Add these to the chickens and let 
them brown. Every inch must be nicely 
browned, but not in the slightest degree 
burned. Add two tablespoonfuls of flour; 
let this brown. Then add a half dozen 
large, fresh tomatoes, nicely sliced, or a 
half can of tomatoes, and let these 
brown. Cook very slowly, allowing the 
mixture to simply simmer. Add chopped 
parsley, thyme and bay leaf, and two 
cloves of garlic finely minced. Let all 
brown without burning. Cover and let 
it smother over a slow but steady fire. 
The tomato juice will make sufficient 
gravy as yet. If you have sweet green 
peppers, add a half dozen, taking the 
seeds out before adding and slicing the 
peppers very fine. Stir well. Let all 
smother steadily for twenty minutes at 
least, keeping well co\'ered and stirring 
occasionally. When well smothered, add 
one cup of Consomme, if you have it; 
if not, one cup of boiling water. Let it 
cook again for a full half hour, very. 
very slowly over a very steady fire, and 
season again to taste. Cook ten minutfts 
more, and serve hot. 

Chicken With MushTOoms. 

Poulet Saute aux Champignons. 

1 Fine Spring Chicken. 1-2 Can of 

Mushrooms. 

2 Tablespoonfuls of Butter. 

2 Chopped Onions. 1 Clove of Garlic. 

1 Glass of Madeira or Sherry Wine. 

1-2 Square Inch of Ham to Season 

Thyme. Parsley, Bay Leaf. 

Cut into joints and season a nicely 
cleaned chicken. Put it in a saucepan 
with two tablespoonfuls of butter, and 
let it simmer for about ten minute?, 
browning slightly, A mushroom sauce Is 
never dark. Add two nicely-chopped on- 
ions, and let these bro^m slightly; then, 
add one-half of a square inch of ham. 
chopped very fine indeed. Add thyma, 
parsley and bay leaf, following carefuHy 
the order given in adding the ingredients. 
A minute later add the garlic, whioh 
has been minced very fine. Let all brown 
together for ten minutes. Cut the mush- 
rooms into halves, put them with thetr 
water into the pot, stirring well. Let 



77 



them simmer five minutes. Then add a 
wineglass of Sherry or Madeira, stir and 
cover the pot closely, so that it can 
smother well. If the sauce appears too 
thick add about a half cup of broth or 
boilingr water. Season to taste, and let 
all cook very slowly for an hour longer 
over a steady fire. The secret in smoth- 
ering chicken is to let it cook slowly, so 
that the seasoning may permeate the 
flesh and the heat by slow degrees ren- 
der it tender and most palatable. 

Chicken With Truffles. 

Poulet Saute aux Truffes. 

Proceed in exactly the same manner

Celery. 1 Onion. 

Celery, Asparagus Tips and Boiled Beets 

to Garnish. 

A Sauce a la Mayonnaise. 



80 



The remains of cold chicken are used 
for this. ' But it is always preferable for 
dinners to boil the chickens nicely and 
use only the white meat, if you wish the 
dish to be recherche. The dark meat, 
however, is equally good, thougrh it may 
not look so pretty. After cooking the 
chickens very tender, pick out all the 
white meat into small pieces of about an 
inch or less, and add cho-pped celery of 
the whitest fiber and very tender. Mix 
thoroughly, using good judgment in ha^^- 
ing partS' of the celery and chicken in 
the proportion of one-third celery. Chop 
an onion very fine, and add. teeason all 
with salt and pepper to taste. Place on 
a dish and spread over a nice Mayon 
naise dressing (see Sauce a la Mayon- 
naise), and garnish prettily with celery 
tips, asparagus tips, olives and very 
delicately sliced red beets, and sliced 
lemon. 

Chicken Xjivers. 

Foies de Volaille. 

Chicken livers may be prepared as 
"Foie de Volaille Saute," or "Foie de 
Volaille en Brochette." They are pre- 
pared in exactly the same manner as in 
the recipes for cooking beef's liver. (See 
recipe.) 

CAPONS. 

Chapons. 

Capons of either turkey or chicken are 
cooked in exactly the same manner, gen- 
erally being best when boiled or roasted. 

Chapon Farcie a la Crenie corresponds 
to Creamed Chicken, and Chapon a la 
Poele corresponds to Poularde a la Poele, 
and are particularly recommended. (See 
recipes.) 

GUINEA FOWL,. 

Pintade. 

The Guinea Fowl is only eaten when 
very young, and then it makes a nice, 
palatable dish. All the preparations giv- 
en for cooking turkey may be followed 
in preparing this fowl, and it is unneces- 
sary to repeat them here. (See recipes for 
Cooking Turkey.) 

GOOSE. 

Oie. 

The goose is a much tougher fowl than 
either the chicken or turkey, and re- 
quires longer to cook. It is also dryjr 
meat, and in roasting requires to have 
a little water poured over it. Never roast 
a goose that is more than eight months 
or a year old, and never eat a goose over 
three years old. The happy age for gen- 
eral cooking is when the goose has 
reached one year or one year and a half. 
Young wild geese of not more than one 
year, and yard ducklings of similar age, 
are broiled in the same manner as spring 
chicken. The fatter the goose the more 
tender and juicy the meat. 

Roast Goose. 

Oie Rotie. 

1 Young Goose. 4 Onions. 
1 Cup of Mashed Potatoes. 
1-2 Teaspoonful of Thyme. 
2 Sprigs of Parsley. 
4 Apples. 1 1-2 Tablespoo'ufuls of Lard. 
Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

A roast goose, properly prepared, Is 
a very savory dish, whether the fowl is 
wild or tame. But, as mentioned above, 
the goose must be tender. If the breast- 
bone yields easily to pressure and the 
pinions are very tender, the legs smooth 



and yellow and free from feathers, the 
goose is young. In picking a goosfe never 
scald it, as this utterly ruins the flesh. 
The goose must be hand picked. Then 
singe and clean, and season well and 
roast as you would a turkey, allowing, 
however, twenty-five minutes to every 
pound. It may be served with a (Jiblet 
Sauce as roast chicken. Apple Sauce or 
Currant Jelly is always served with Roast 
Goose, preferably the Apple Sauce. Any 
stuffing used in baking a turkey may be 
used for roast goose, such as oyster or 
egg, etc. But the following is an excel- 
lent special dressing and seems to bring 
out more than any other the flavor of the 
goose: 

Take one cup of mashed potatoes, four 
apples, peeled nicely and cored, and four 
onions, one-half teaspoonful of sage, pow- 
dered well; one-half teaspoonful of 
thyme, and pepper and salt to taste. 
Place the apples and onions and herbs 
in a saucepan and add water sufficiently 
to cover nicely. Let all cook together 
till soft. Then mash well and rub through 
a sieve. Add the cup of mashed pota- 
toes and mix well, seasoning with salt 
and pepper. Stuff the body and craw, 
sew up and truss the goose. Put into 
the roasting pan, rubbing a half table- 
spoonful of lard over it and souring over 
a half cup of water, boiling. Baste the 
goose very frequently, say every ten 
minutes, so that it %^-ill be fine and juicy. 
It generallv requires at least an hour 
and a half to roast well, but the rule 
of twenty-five minutes to the pound Is a 
good one to follow. A "Green Goose ' 
is always best for roasting, "but this muijt 
be covered from the beginning with a 
piece of buttered paper, else it will brown 
before cooking. Serve with Apple Sauce. 

Goose Daube. 

Oie en Daube. 

Prepare in exactly the same manner 

as Turkey Daube (see recipe). A goose 

that is not so young may be cooked a la 

Daube. 

Goose u la Chlpolata. 

Oie a la Chlpolata. 
1 Fine Young Goose. 
1-2 Pound of Chaurice. 1 Can of Mush- 
rooms. 
1 Dozen Large Chestnuts, nicely 
roasted and skinned. 
1 Sprig Each of Thyme and Bay Leaf. 
3 Sprigs of Parsley. 
The Juice of 2 Lemons. 
4 or 5 Bits of Lemon Peel. 
2 Onions. 1 Pint of Boiling Water. 
1-2 Tablespoonful of Lard or Butter. 

1 Spoon of Flour, 
Place the lard or butter in the stewpot 
and when it melts add the onions, which 
have been nicely sliced. As they brown 
add the goose, which has been cleaned, 
singed and nicely cut at the joints into 
pieces, and well rubbed with salt and 
pepper, and the sausage, which must be 
cut in halves. Let simmer for about ten 
minutes, until every portion is slightly 
browned, and then add the minced herbs 
and garlic. After three minutes add the 
spoonful of flour, mixing well, and let 
it all simmer for ten minutes longer, 
then pour in the can of mushrooms and 
their water, and add immediately the 
chestnuts. Let the goose cook till ten- 
der, and serve hot. 

rat Hvers. 
Des Foies Gras. 
The livers of geese that have been 
caged tightly, so that they can make no 



81 



movement, and which have been kept in 
a very high temperature, much higher 
than that of the atmosphere — geese 
which have been deprived of every ray 
of light— are used for the famous dish, 
"Foies Gras." The French first discov- 
ered tliis manner of caging geese, do- 
ing it at their ancient stronghold of 
Strasbourg. At Toulouse the livers of 
tame duclts were treated in the same 
manner. The Creoles, descendants of the 
French, brought over the custom to the 
old French colony of Louisiana, whence 
it has spread to all portions of the United 
States. While the livers of the geese or 
duclcs become soft and fat under this 
treatment, the rest of the body suffers, 
and becomes so very fat that the goose 
flesh is good for nothing, or, as the Cre- 
oles say, "Plus bonne a rien." Foies Gras 
are now sold in cans in every large groc- 
ery establishment in the United States. 
They come already coolced, in such shape 
that they can easily be made into any 
of the delectable dishes that so delight 
the old Creole or French "bon vivants." 
The most famous of tliese dishes is the 

Ptitties of FoieB Gray. 

Pates de Foie Gras. 

1 Terrine of Foies Gras. 

1 Pound of Fat Pork. 
1 Pound of Goose Fat. 

1-2 Can of Truffles. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

A Glass of Sherry Wine. 

A Puff Paste. 

Procure the fat livers of geese. (They 
are no longer to be bought except already 
prepared in cans, Terrine de Foie Gras 
aux Truffles du Perigord, Strasbourg.) 
To this allow one pound of fat pork and 
one pound of the fat of geese. Chop 
these and the livers very fine, allowing 
pound for pound of the fat meat and 
goose fat to the same quantity of livers. 
Season well with salt and pepper, and 
moisten it well with Sherry wine. Chop 
a half can of truffles and mix, and put 
all in a quart or pint measure baking 
pan, which you will have lined with Puff 
Paste. (See recipe.) The pan must be 
about two and a half or three inches 
deep. Bake this paste, and then fill in 
with the foies gras, (Tover with a light 
cover of the dough, and decorate around 
the edges with the clippings of dough 
that remain. Place the pie in the oven, 
and let it bake for about an hour to a 
nice brown, covering for the first three- 
quarters of an hour with a piece of pa- 
per, to prevent burning. When done, 
serve in the dish in which it was baked. 
This is the real Creole Pate de Foie Gras.

of bacon, and moisten with sufficient 
White wine to cover well, and two spoon- 
fuls of Brandy. Add the juice of a lemon 
aifd let it simmer well for a few minutes. 



Then add the livers, and let them sim- 
mer for ten minutes longer. Season to 
taste, cook five minutes more and serve 
hot. In seasoning the livers prepared in 
this manner must always have a stimu- 
lating taste.

young sweetbread and cook according to 
recipe for Plain Fried Sweetbreads, and 
add a half cup of the soft of the bread, 
well moistened with milk. Mix this witJti 
the hashed sweetbreads, and add the 
yolk of an egg. Place this in a mortar 
with the foies gras and mix well. Then 
turn into a pan and brush lightly with 
the beaten yolk of an egg, and sprinkle 
grated bread crumbs over. Set in a pan 
of boiling water (Bain-marie), and bake 
in the oven for about a half hour.

CHAPTER XVII. 
PIGEONS. 



Pigeons. 



Pigeons are of two kinds, those of the 
dovecoat and those that are shot on the 
wing, commonly called doves. The latter 
are always broiled, just as one would 
broil any other bird or a tenderloin beet- 
steak; else they are roasted in little 
bands of bacon. The former are prepared 
in various ways, as. Indeed, the latter 
may be also, only the wild taste is more 
apparent when broiled or roasted. 

Broiled Pigeons. 

Pigeons Grillees. 

6 or 8 Young Squab. 

3 Tablespoonfuls of Melted Butter. 

6 or 8 Pieces of Buttered Toast. 

The Juice of 1 Lemon. 

Chopped Parsley to Garnish. 

Squab are always best for broiling. 
Pluck and clean nicely inside and out. 
Wipe with a damp towel. Split down 
the back and spread open as you would 
a broiled chicken. Have the gridiron very 
hot. Rub the pigeon inside and out with 
salt and pepper, and brush lightly with 
butter. Place the broiler over a mod- 
erate furnace fire, from which all the gas 
has been exhausted, and let it broii 
slowly ten minutes on the inner side 
and five minutes on the outer. In the 
meantime toast a piece of bread for every 
pigeon that you broil. Moisten well with 
butter. Place the squab upon the toast, 
allowing one squab for each piece of 
toast, sprinkle with chopped parsley and 
butter, and serve hot. It is always well 
to rub the pigeon with a little lemon 
juice, as that renders the flesh nice and 
white. 

PigeonB Broiled a la Crapaudlne 

Pigeons a la Crapaudlne. 

4 Pigeons. The Yolk of an Egg. 

1 Cup of Milk. 1 Tablespoonful of Butter. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

A Tomato Sauce. 

This is a famous Creole dish, and the 
object is to so dress the pigeons that 
they will resemble little frogs, hence 
the name, "Pigeons a la Crapaudlne." 

Clean the pigeons nicely, inside and 
out, and then carefully cut the breast 
from the loin joints, without separating 
entirely. Raise the breast up from the 
shoulder joints, and pass it over the 
head of the pigeon, without separating it 
from the shoulders. Then press it down 
very firmly with your hands or a masher. 
Have ready the yolk of one egg, well 
beaten in a cup of milk. Season well 
with salt and pepper. Soak the pigeons 
in it well, so that they will absorb the 
milk and be thoroughly impregnated. 
Roll over and over, so that they will 
gather up the seasoning. Then pass 
them through bread crumbs, rolling and 
then patting each pigeon with your 
hands, so that the crumbs will hold. 
Brush each with a little melted butter. 
Have ready a double broiler, well heated, 
but on a slow fire. Place the pigeons 
on it, broiling very slowly. Broil tor 
fifteen or twenty minutes, allowing from 
seven to ten minutes to each side, and 
serve with Tomato Sauce. (See recipe.) 



Roasted Squab. 

Pigeons Rotis sur Canapes. 

6 or S Young Squab. 

6 or 8 Thin Slices of Fat Bacon. 

4 Tablespoonfuls of Butter. 

Truffles (if desired). 

2 Tablespoonfuls of Water. 

6 or 8 Slices of Buttered Toast. 

Use squab only for roasting. Clean 
nicely, and then truss the pigeon as you 
would a turkey, only use wooden skew* 
ers to hold the wings and legs in place. 
Take a slice of nice fat pork and fasten 
it around the body of each pigeon, pass- 
ing over the breast. Put a bit of butter 
about the size of a pecan in each bird, 
and, if you can afford to do so, you may 
stuff with truffles. But this is a matter 
of taste. Put the pigeons in the roasting 
pan, and add a tablespoonful of butter 
and about two tablespoonfuls of water. 
The oven should be hot, but must not be 
scorching. Baste the birds frequently, 
and let them roast from fifteen to twenty 
minutes, according to their size. Prepare 
toasted bread, one slice for each pigeon. 
Butter well, and then remove the fat 
pork and place the pigeons on the 
toast. Pour over each a little of the 
gravy which has been made in the roast- 
ing pan, allowing it to soak into the 
bread. Serve hot, with a jelly, prefer- 
ably Cranberry Sauce. (See recipe.) 

Compote of Pigeons. 

Pigeons en Compote. 

6 Fine Fat Squab. A Half Can of Mush- 
rooms. 
1 Clove of Garlic. 
2 Sprigs Each of Thyme and Parsley. 
1 Bay Leaf. 1 Onion. 
2 Tablespoonfuls of White TiVine. 
1 Tablespoonful of Butter. 
1-2 Cup of Consomme. 

Clean the squabs nicely; singe, draw 
and truss, with their legs inside. Rub 
well with salt and pepper and three 
cloves, ground very fine, and three all- 
spice, also ground very fine. Take a ta- 
blespoonful of butter and melt in a 
saucepan. Add the sliced onion, and as 
it browns add the sliced carrot. Let this 
simmer gently for three or four minutes, 
and then add a minced sprig of thyme, 
and parsley, and one bay leaf and the 
clove of a garlic, minced very fine. Let 
all this brown, and then place on top the 
pigeons, which you will have bound in 
thin strips of bacon tied around th& 
body. Add two tablespoonfuls of White 
wine and cover well. Let this simmer 
for about fifteen minutes, till the pigeons 
are nicely browned, and then add a half 
cup of consomme, if you have it; if not, 
a half cup of boiling water. After ten 
minutes add a half can of mushrooms. 
Let all simmer gently for an hour longer, 
being careful not to let the pigeons go 
to pieces. Watch, therefore, very care- 
fully. Place each pigeon on a slice of 
toasted Crouton, and garnish with the 
mushrooms. Pour over the gravy, and 
serve hot. This is a most excellent com- 
pote.

Squab With Green Peas. 

Pigeons Etouffes aux Petit Pols. 

3 Pigeons. 1 Pint of Green Peas. 

1-4 Inch of Ham. 2 Onions. 

1 Tablespoonful of Butter. 

1 Bay Leaf. 

1 Sprig Each of Thyme and Parsley. 

1 Clove of Garlic. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

Clean the pigeons nicely, leaving them 
whole, as you would a fowl that is to be 
roasted, and truss nicely. Take two 
onions and slice well, and place in a 
saucepan with a tablespoonful of melted 
butter. Let them brown slightly, and 
lay the pigeons that have been rubbed 
well with salt and pepper, inside and out, 
on top of the onions. Cover closely and 
let them smother. Then add for one 
pigeon one-half or one-quarter of an 
inch of nice ham, minced very fine, to 
give a good seasoning. Then add one 
sprig of thyme and one bay leaf, and 
the clove of a garlic, minced very fine. 
Let this smother very slowly for ten oi 
fifteen minutes. When well browned 
moisten with a cup of consomme or 
broth, and add one pint of fresh green 
peas, or one can. Cover tight, and let all 
simmer over a slow fire for one hour, or 
more if the pigeons are not very tender. 
Serve on a platter, placing the pigeons 
In the center and heaping the green peas 
around. This is delicious, and the real 
Creole method of cooking pigeons with 
green peas. 

Pigreons and Crawfish. 

Pigeqns a la Cardinale. 

3 Pigeons. 2 Dozen Crawfish. 

1 Slice of Fat Bacon. 1 Square Inch of 

Ham. 

1 Onion. 1 Carrot. 1 Herb Bouquet. 

1 Tablespoonful of Butter. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

Clean the pigeons nicely, and rub in- 
side and out with the juice of a lemou. 
Then rub with salt and pepper, and brush 
with melted butter. Place thin strips of 
fat bacon in the bottom of a saucepan, 
lay the pigeons on this, and cover with 
another thin layer of strips of bacon. 
Cover with butter and set in a slow oven. 



and let them simmer gently. In the mean- 
time prepare a "Poele" as follows: Take 
a small square inch of ham, chop or 
mince very fine, and fry in a table- 
spoonful of butter. Add an onion ami 
a carrot, chopped fine. Let these brown, 
and then add an herb bouquet, minced 
very fine. When brown add a cup of 
bouillon, and let it boil for ten minutes. 
Pour this sauce over the baking pigeons, 
and let them cook slowly for about an 
hour, or until done. In the meantime 
boil about two dozen nice crawfish, ac- 
cording to recipe (see Crawfish), and, 
when the pigeons are done, place them 
on buttered Croutons and place between 
each a garnish of crawfish. Add about 
a half cup of the broth in which the 
crawfish have been boiled to the gravy 
in the baking dish. Let it simmer for 
five minutes till reduced slightly, and 
pour over the pigeons. This is Creole to 
the letter. 

Pigeon Pie, 

Vol-au-Vent de Pigeons. 

6 Young Wiild Pigeons. 
1 Onion. 1 Tablespoonful of Lard. 
1 Tablespoonful of Flour. 
1 Sprig Each Thyme, Bay Leaf and Pars- 
ley. 
Pie Paste. 

Clean and cut the young pigeons into 
small pieces of about two inches in 
length and make a plain fricassee. (See 
Fricassee Brown Gravy.) Prepare a Vol- 
au-Vent Paste (see recipe) and fill a 
tin pan of about two quarts with the 
paste. Pour in pigeons and gravy, and 
let bake in the oven till the top crust 
is nicely browned. Always bake the 
under crust first. This is a delightful 
entree at any feast. 

Again, the pie may be prepared as fol- 
lows: After cleaning the pigeons, stuff 
each daintily with oyster or egg dressing 
and then loosen the joints with a knife 
without separating them. Put into a 
stewpan and make a plain fricassee as 
above indicated. Let them cook until 
tender, and season with salt and pepper. 
Fill the pie dish with the pie paste; put 
in the birds, pour over the gravy, cover 
with a crust and bake. 



CHAPTER XVIII. 
GAME. 



Glbier. 



The number and variety of the game 
of the Louisiana forests have been the 
subject of many a magazine and news- 
paper article, and the administration and 
Joy of the chasseurs, or hunters, from 
earliest days. Our birds alone are so 
distinct and remarkable that the great 
Audubon devoted his life to their study, 
and his volume on the birds of Louisi- 
ana stands out as the greatest work ex- 
tant upon birds. The fact is, that all 
through the year, from January to De- 
cember, fancy game may be found In the 
New Orleans markets, though the game 
laws are very strict, and no bird is al- 
lowed to be shot out of season. 

Something to Remember When OooklnK 

Game. 

Game should never be fried. This Is 
horrible. The larger game is roasted or 
broiled, or, as with ducks and venison, 
squirrels and rabbits, made into stews 
or "salmis." The smaller game Is roasted 
or broiled. 



VENISON. 



Du Chevreuil. 

The meat of Venison may be kept in 

cold weather at least ten or twelve days, 

if hung in a cold place; in warm weather 

for much less time, unless dried. The 

meat of fresh Venison is of a fine grain, 

and is always nicely covered with fat. 

The age of the deer can always be told 

by examining the hoofs; if it is young, 

the hoofs will be very slightly opened; 

if old, they will stand apart Of all 

meats, Venison cooks the most rapidly. 

Venison is always best when the deer 

has been killed in the autumn. Wild 

berries are then plentiful and the animal 

has then abundant opportunity to fatten 

upon this and other fresh, wild food. 

Boast Haunch of Venison. 

Culssot de Chevreuil Rotl. 

A Haunch or Saddle of Venison. 

Melted Butter. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

Watercress to Garnish. Currant Jelly. 



Prepare the haunch or saddle of Veni- 
son in the same manner as you would the 
roast beef. (See recipe Roast Beef.) Onl> 
pour a cup of water over the venison 
when putting in the oven, for it is a 
dry meat, and requires a little moistening 
if roasted. Bake in a quick oven, allow- 
ing ten minutes to the pound. A haunch 
of Doe Venison will require in the ag- 
gregate half an hour less time to roast 
than Buck Venison. To prevent the hoof 
and hair just above changing color In 
cooking always bind this with a coarse 
piece of muslin, in four or five pieces of 
thickness, covering the hoof and hair. 
Wet with cold water, and bind a buttered 
paper tightly around and over it. Baste 
every ten minutes, with melted buttei 
first, and then with the drippings of thn 
Venison. When half cooked, turn the 
Venison over, so that the other side may 
cook. Unbind the hoofs and garnish 
them with quilled paper. Place the Veni- 
son on a dish garnished with Watercress. 
Serve with Currant Jelly. (See recipe.) 

Saddle of Venison, Currant Jelly Sauce. 

Selle de Chevreuil, Sauce GrOseille. 

A Saddle of Venison Weighing About 5 

Pounds. 

1 Onion. 1 Carrot. 

1-2 Tablespoonful of Butter. 

1-2 Glass of Madeira Wine. 

1 Gill of Consomme. 

Currant Jelly Sauce. 

Skin the Venison neatly and remove 
all the sinews from the surface. Take 
fine larding needles and lard closely. Tie 
the saddle around four times. Slice the 
carrot and onion and put in the roasting 
pan. Place the Saddle of Venison on top 
of these, sprinkle lightly with a pincli 
of salt, and spread a half tablespoonful 
of butter over. Set in a brisk oven and 
roast for forty minutes, frequently bast- 
ing the Venison with its own gravy. Be- 
fore takine it from the pan remove the 
cord which binds it and place the sad- 
dle in a hot dish. Then pour the Ma- 
deira wine and a gill of veal consomme 
into the pan, set on the stove and let it 
come to a boil. Then skim the gravy of 
all fat and strain over the Venison. Serve 
with a hot Currant Jelly Sauce as fol- 
lows: Take a half pint of Currant Jelly 
and stir till it is thoroughly dissolved. 
Then put in a saucepan a wineglassful of 
good old Port wine, and set on the stove 
and let it come gradually to a boll. 
Add the currant Jelly and mix till thor- 
oughly dissolved; then add a tablespoon- 
ful of Sauce Espagnole (see recipe) and 
let it again come to a boil. Serve with 
the Venison, sending each to the tabic 
separately. 

Venison steaks broiled may also be 
served with this sauce. The steaks are 
placed in a dish one overlapping the 
other; the hot sauce is poured over and 
thus sent to the table. 

Venison Stcalis a la Poivrade. 

Filet de Chevreuil a la Poivrade. 

6 Filets or as Many Filets as Desired 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. A Sauoe 

Poivrade. 

The filets or Venison steaks are taken 
from any part of the Venison. The best 
are from the haunch or leg, and out 
three-quarters of an inch in thickness 
Rub them well with salt and pepper a-^d 
then fry in butter, allowing about five 
minutes to the steak. Venison must bt 
served on a very hot dish and eaten hot 
Place in a heated dish, and garnish with 
melted butter and chopped parsley, and 



serve with a Sauce Poivrade for Venison 
(see recipe), pouring the sauce over the 
steaks. This is a delicious dish. 

Venison Outlets Broiled. 

Cotelettes de Chevreuil Grilles. 
6 Venison Cutlets. 
2 Tablespoonfuls of Melted Butter. 
CJhopped Parsley. 
Salt and Pepper to Taste. 
Watercress to Garnish. 
Trim the cutlets nicely, rub well witt 
salt and pepper, brush with a little but- 
ter, and broil over a quick, clear fire, al- 
lowing about eight minutes, or less; ac- 
cording to size, to each cutlet. They 
must always, like all Venison, be under- 
done. When cooked, place in a very hot 
dish, pour over a little melted butter 
and chopped parsley, garnish with water- 
cress, and serve with Currant Jelly. 
Stewed Venison a la Creole, 
Salmi de Chevreuil a la Creole. 

Venison Steaks, or Rougher Part of the 

Deer. 

2 Onions. 1 Square Inch of Ham. 

1 Tablespoonful of Butter. 

1 Clove of Garlic, Chopped Very Fine. 
1 Herb Bouquet, Chopped Fine 

1 Glass of Claret 1 Cud of Water. 
1 Can of Mushrooms. 

The rougher parts of Venison are 
usually used for stewing, but the dish 
is most delicious when made of Venison 
steaks. Cut the Venison into two-inch 
square pieces, and rub well with salt and 
pepper. Chop two onions very fine, and 
put them in a stewpan with- a tablespoon- 
ful of melted butter. Let them brown 
slightly; then add the Venison meat. Let 
it brown slightly, and then add one table- 
spoonful of flour, and let this brown a 
little. Chop the square inch of ham very 
fine, mincing it, and add. Then add the 
clove of garlic, and two sprigs each of 
thyme and parsley and a bay leaf, minced 
fine. Let this brown nicely, and pour 
over one glass of good Claret. L.et this 
cook for ten minutes, stirring it Con- 
stantly, so that it will not burn, and then 
add one cup of boiling water. Stir well, 
season again to taste, and let it boil for 
thirty minutes, and serve hot. This dish 
will be improved beyond estimation If 
a can of mushrooms is added immediate- 
ly after adding the water. But it may 
be made without the mushrooms. Serve 
very hot. 

Venison, Hunter's Style. 

Chevreuil a la Chasseur. 

3 Pounds of Venison Meat. 

2 Tablespoonfuls of Butter. 

1 Onion. 1 Square Inch of Ham. 

1 Tablespoonful of Flour. 

1 Clove of Garlic. 2 Sprigs of Thyme. 

2 Bay Leaves. 

1-3 Fox of Mushrooms. The Zest of a 

Lemon. 

1 Glass of White Wine. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

Croutons to Garnish. 

Cut the Venison into pieces of about 
two inches square. Salt and pepper well. 
Put two tablespoonfuls of butter Into a 
saucepan with the Venison and let it 
brown slowly. When nearly brown, add 
an onion, chopped fine, and let this brown 
slightly; then add the ham, minced very 
tine, and the clove of garlic and ba-/ 
leaves and thyme, minced verv fine. Stir 
In with the Aenison, and let these brown 
for about two minutes. Then add a ta- 
blespoonful of flour and brown for a 



85 



few minutes more. Add a half bottle of 
White wine and let all simmer for five 
minutes. Then add a quart of consomme 
or water and let all cook for about one 
hour. Season again according to taste 
and add a, half can of mushrooms 
chopped fine and the zest of a lemon and 
season again to taste. Let all cook a 
half hour longer and serve on a hot dish 
with Croutons fried in butter. 

Stewed Venison, French Style. 

.Civet de Chevreuil a, la Francaise. 

2 1-2 Pounds of Venison (the lower and 

lean part preferable). 

A Handful of Parsley. 1 Onion. 

1 Sprig of Thyme. 2 Bay Leaves. 

12 Whole Peppers. A Half Glass of 

Vinegar. 

1 1-2 Glass of Claret. 

1 Pint of Veal Consomme. 

1 Ounce of Salt Pork. 12 Small Onions. 

1 Dozen and a Half Mushrooms. 

1 Herb Bouquet. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. Croutons. 

Cut the Venison into small pieces of 
about two inches square. Make a "Ma- 
rinade" by placing the Venison in an 
earthen jar with one large onion sliced, 
a handful of parsley, the chopped thyme 
and bay leaf, the whole peppers, a light 
seasoning of salt and black pepper, and 
the vinegar. Let the Venison marinate 
for twelve hours. Then drain it from 
the juice and place it in a saucepan 
with one tablespoonful of the best but- 
ter, and let it brown over . a moderate 
fire. After ten minutes add three table- 
spoonfuls of flour and stir constantly. 
Then moisten with the consomme and 
the claret. Season again to taste with 
salt and pepper, and stir until it comes 
to a boil. Then add the small onions 
which have been nicely peeled, and one 
ounce of salt pork and the herb bou- 
quet. Let all cook about forty minutes, 
and about five minutes before serving 
add the mushrooms. Take the herb bou- 
quet from the preparation; place the lat- 
ter on a hot dish and decorate nicely 
with toasted Croutons, and serve hot. 

Venison in a Chafing Dish 

Chevreuil au Rechaud. 

8 or 10 Slices of Venison. 

2 Tablespoonfuls of Butter. 

1 Tablespoonful of Currant Jelly. 

1 Tablespoonful of VS^ater. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

This is a most delicious way of pre- 
paring Venison. The old Creoles use, if 
a chafing dish is not available, a little 
alcohol lamp and a frying pan. Slice 
the Venison very thin in pieces about t-^o 
inches long and one inch wide, and about 
the thickness of a silver dollar. Have 
the chafing dish or alcohol lamp on the 
dining table, as you sit to eat. The pan 
must be very hot. The meat must be 
well seasoned with salt and pepper, and 
ready to put into the pan. Put a table- 
spoonful of butter into the dish. Let it 
get very hot, without burning. Put the 
slices of Venison in the dish. In one 
minute turn them over. Take a table 
spoonful of melted butter, and blend well 
with a tablespoonful of Currant Jelly 
and a tablespoonful of water. Spread 
this over the cooking Venison. Turn 
again. Let it cook for five minutes only, 
and serve very hot. This is one of the 
finest old-fashioned Creole dishes, and is 
good for breakfast, luncheon or supper. 
Bear in mind that to be effective it must 
be made at the table, as It will lose half 



its flavor if brought from the kitchen to 
the table. 

Venison Hash. 

Hachis de Chevreuil. 

3 Cups of Left-Over Venison. 

6 Potatoes. 1 Herb Bouquet. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

1 Tablespoonful of Lard or Butter. 

This is a splendid way of utilizing the 
left-over Venison. After having taken 
off all the rough edges of the roast and 
cut out the gristle and hard membrane, 
hash the Venison into pieces of about 
one inch in size. Take six left-over to- 
matoes, or freshly boiled, and cut into 
quarters. Chop fine one herb bouquet. 
Place a tablespoonful of butter or a half 
tablespoonful of lard into the stewpot, 
and as it melts add the Venison, seasoned 
well, and a few minutes later the fine 
herbs. Mince the clove of a garlic if the 
flavor is liked and add. Stir constantly 
without browning much, and add a table- 
spoonful of flour. Let this brown very 
slightly, and then add the tomatoes. 
Cover and let all simmer for about twen- 
ty minutes, and then pour over a pint 
of boiling water. Season again to taste 
and set back on the stove and let it sim- 
mer gently for about three-quarters of 
an hour. Cut some Croutons and fry 
them in butter; place on a dish -and serve 
with the hash. ^ 

WILD TURKEY. 

Dinde Sauvage. 
The wild turkey abounds in Louisiana. 
It is roasted in the same manner as the 
domestic fowl (see recipe) and always 
served with Cranberry Sauce. (See re- 
cipe.) 

WILD DUCKS. 
Canards Sauvages. 

The wild duck?, so much enjoyed in 
Louisiana, are many, but the most fa- 
mous are the Canvasback Ducks, or 
"Cannards Cheval," the more delicate 
"Teal Ducks," or "Sarcelles," and the 
noted Mallard Ducks, or "Canards Pran- 
eais." Then we have a species of water 
fowl called the "Poule d'Bau," or water 
chicken, which lives exclusively In the 
waters of the Louisiana bayous and 
marshes; as it never comes on dry land, 
it has been classed by the ancient Creoles 
among the fish, and is eaten on Fridays 
and fast days, when flesh meat is pro- 
hibited to Catholics. 

In the following recipes given be- 
low, it must be borne in mind that all 
tame or domestic ducks may be cooked 
in the same manner as the wild ducks. 
For this reason it would"be superfluous 
to give a special section to the former. 
But the flavor of the wild duck is such 
that it is always preferred on Creole ta- 
bles as the superior bird. Ducks are 
stewed or roasted. The wild goose, or "Die 
Sauvage," is cooked in the same manner 
as the wild duck and the domestic goose. 
The "Duckling," or "Canneton," in the 
same manner as the delicate "Teal Duck" 
or "Sarcelle." 

In cleaning all game, remember that 
they must be hand-picked, and never 
scalded, as scalding utterly ruins their 
flavor. Wild duck should not be dressed 
too soon after being killed. 

Canvasback Duck. 

Canatd Cheval. 

Epicureans declare that the Canvas- 
back Duck is the King of Birds. And 



S6 



as it feeds mostly on wild celery, it re- 
quires no flavors or spices to make it 
perfect. The bird partakes of the flavor 
of the celery on which it feeds. This de- 
licious flavor is best preserved when the 
duck is roasted quickly with a hot fire. 
And so also with the dainty Mallard or 
French Ducks. 

Mallard Ducks or Ganvasback Ducks 
Boasted. 

Canards FYancais ou Canard Cheval 
Rotis. 

1 Pair of Wild Ducks. 

1 Tablespoonful of Butter. Salt and 

Pepper to Taste. 

Clean the ducks as you would a chick- 
en, without scalding, however. Rinse out 
the inside and wipe well inside and out 
with a wet towel. But do not wash the 
duck unless you have broken the gall 
bladder, as the washing destroys their 
flavor. Rub the inside well with salt 
and pepper, and rub outside as thorough- 
ly. Place a three-inch lump of butter on 
the inside. Truss nicely and place tha 
ducks in a baking pan, and brush the 
tops with melted butter. Pour over two 
tablespoonfuls of water, and set in a 
very hot oven, and allow them to bak^ 
t^wenty minutes, if they are not very 
large, and thirty minutes, if larger than 
the ordinary size of Canvasback ducks. 
A wild duck is never cooked dry. It must 
reach the point where the blood will not 
run if the flesh is pierced with the fork 
in carving. When done, place the ducks 
in a very hot dish, and serve with their 
own gravy poured over them. Garnish 
nicely with parsley or watercress. Serve 
with Currant Jelly. Always have the 
plates very hot in which you serve the 
ducks at table. 

Broiled Canvasback Ducks. 

Canards Cheval Grillees. 

1 Pair of Ducks. 

1 Tablespoonful of Olive Oil. 

Salt and Pepper. 

Drawn Butter Sauce. 

The Juice of 1 Lemon. 

Minced Parsley to Garnish. 

The Canvasback Duck Is very excellent 
when broiled. Hunters often serve it 
thus when on long hunts, and it is said 
the taste of the game Just bagged is be- 
yond estimate. Broiled Canvasbaoks are 
served as follows on the Creole table: 
Clean the duck nicely, as for broiling a 
chicken, wipe well and split down the 
middle of the back In the same manner 
as for a chicken. Season well with salt 
and pepper. Rub the duck well witli 
olive oil of the best quality, and place on 
the broiler. Turn It over at least twice, 
so that it will cook thoroughly through 
and through without burning. Let it cook 
from seven to ten minutes on either side. 
Place on a dish that is very hot, pour 
over a Drawn Butter Sauce, in which 
you will have squeezed the Juice of a 
lemon, and mixed some minced parsley. 
Decorate with watercress or parsley 
sprigs. Bring to the table covered and 
very hot, and serve on heated plates. 
This dish Is very elegant.

3 Sprigs Each of Thyme and Parsley. 

This is one of the most delightful ways 
of cooking wild ducks. The turnip blends 
well with the flavor of the wild ducks, 
and a nicer way of serving this vegeta- 
ble in combination does not exist. Clean 
the Ducks, and cut into pieces at the 
joints. Put a tablespoonful of butter

over Duck; take all the remains of the 
Duck and select the good parts, and cut 
them into pieces of about an inch and 
a half square. Put a tablespoonful of 
butter into the stewpan, and. as it 
browns, add one onion, chopped fine. Stir

slices, and serve with a sauce made as 
follows: Take one tablespoonful of but- 
ter, one-half tumbler of Currant Jelly, 
and two tablespoonfuls of good Port 
wine. "Warm the butter in the saucepan, 
add the wine and .ielly, thoroughly blend- 
ed; mix well, and serve with the slices 
of cold duck. The duck may also be 
served very deliciously with Currant Jelly 
alone, and buttered toast. 

Teal Duck. 

Sarcelle. 
The Teal Duck is the smallest and most 
delicate of the wild ducks. It is prepared 
in the same manner as the Mallard, pref- 
erence, however, being always gIvSn to 
roasting and broiling, on account of its 
size. The Teal Duck is always broiled 
whole, without splitting on the back.

Teal Ducks Boasted. 

Sarcelles Roties. 

3 Pairs of Teal Ducks. 

6 Thin Strips of Bacon. 

6 Truffles. 1 Tablespoonful of Butter. 

2 Tablespoonfuls of Water. 

6 Slices of Toast. 

Currant Jelly. 

Clean the duck nicely and put one 
truffle and a lump of butter about the 
size of a peanut, with salt and pepper, 
on the inside. Rub well with salt and 
pepper and a little butter melted. Take 
a thin strip of bacon and bind it around 
the body of the duck, fastening .with a 
skewer. Place a tablespoonful of butter 
in the roasting pan, and pour about two 
tablespoonfuls of water in it, dropping 
slightly over each bird. Set in a quick 
oven and bake for thirty minutes, or 
until done. The bird should always bo 
served underdone. Have ready a hot 
dish, garnished with parsley, and a slice 
of toast buttered for each bird. Place 
the birds on them, sprinkle over chopped 
parsley, and take the juice in which the 
birds have been roasted, pour a little 
over each bird, so that it sinks down 
into the toast, and squeeze a little lemon 
juice over each, and serve hot. 

The truffle may be omitted, but it lo 
considered very elegant. The bird is just 
as good without, however, and it is 
within the reach of the poorest, simply 
for the hunting. Serve with Currant 
Jelly. 

Teal Duck Broiled.

Teal Duck a la Bigrarade. 

Sarcelle a. la Bigarade. 

3 Pairs of Teal Ducks. 

1 Bigarade or Sour Orange. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

A Sauce a I'Bspagnole. 

Clean the ducks and take the liver^ 
and fry them in a little melted butter. 
Season well with salt and pepper and a 
slight pinch of ground allspice and cloves 
and the zest of a "bigarade," or sour 
orange. If the orange is not availabl«, 
take the zest of a lemon. The zest is the 
skin of the orange or lemon, scraped off 
without touching the inner pulp, or white 
skin. Place this in the interior of the 
ducks (you must have the boiled livers 
of five or six for the garnishment of two 
ducks), and then rub the outside well 
with salt and pepper. Bind with a' strip 
of bacon and place on the broiler. In 
about thirty minutes It will he done. 
Cook over a slow fire, turning frequent- 
ly. In the meantime prepare a "Sauce a 
I'Espagnole," and as soon n<! the birds 



are done pour off from the broiler all 
the juice that has fallen, and put this 
into the sauce, with the juice of two 
sour oranges or citrons. Let it waria 
without boiling, pour over the birds, 
which you have placed on buttered toast, 
and serve hot. This is an ancient Creole 
dish, almost lost in our day, but which 
deserves to be resurrected.

HABE. 

Lievre. 

The hare and the rabbit are very much 
alike, the closest relationship existing 
between the two. The principal differ- 
ence is that the rabbit is smaller in size 
than the hare, and its ears and legs are 
shorter. 

The hare m.ay be cooked in almost any 
manner in which rabbits are served. 
There are, however, some special methods 
in vogue among the Creoles which are 
here appended. In preparing the hare 
for roasting, it should be first skinned., 
and then washed well in cold water and 
rinsed thoroughly in tepid water. If the 
hare seems a little musty from being 
emptied before being hung up, rub the 
insides well with vinegar and again wash 
thoroughly' in warm water. Prepare for 
cooking as you would a rabbit, wipe well 
with a soft towel, dress nicely, stew the 
animal up and truss it, and allow it to 
roast from three-quarters of an "hour to 
one hour, according to size. Baste oc- 
casionally with butter, just before serv- 
ing. Of late the hare is much affected 
by epicures. Many consider the meat far 
more tender and of more delicate flavor 
than the rabbit. It is generally served 
with Currant Jelly. 

Hare, Boasted and Stuffed. 

Lievre Roti. 

2 Fine Hares 3 Onions. 

1 Carrot. 3 Apples. 

2 Ounces of Sausage Meat. 

6 Mushrooms. 1 Lemon. 

1 Sprig of Thyme. 1 Bay Leaf. 

2 Cloves. 3 Sprigs of Parsley. 

1 Glass of "White Wine or Cider. 

1 Pint of Consomme. 

ITablespoonful of Butter. 

2 Slices of Bacon. 

1-2 Tablespoonful of Pepper. 

1-2 Tablespoonful of Salt. 

Croutons. 



Select two fine Hares and cut them 
in half. Separate the hindquarters from 
the fore and then bone them down to 
the legs. Do not bone the legs. Place 
the Hares in an earthen dish that is 
quite deep, then make a marinade as 
follows: Pour in a glassful of White 
wine, add a small lemon nicely sliced, 
and a small onion minced fine, one sprig 
of thyme and one bay leaf, all minced 
very fine. Season this preparation w^ith 
a tablespoonful of salt and a table- 
spoonful of pepper and two mashed 
cloves. Take the saddles of the 
Hares and roll them well in this, and 
let the entire Hares steep well in the 
marinade for twelve hours. 

Chop an onion very fine and put it in 
a .saucepan on the stove, and, when well 
heated, put in a tablespoonful of but- 
ter, cook for one minute, and then add 
two ounces of fine chaurice (sausage) 
(see recipe), chopped very fine; six mush- 
rooms, chopped very fine; a teaspoonful 
of minced parsley, a teaspoonful of 
salt and a half teaspoonful of pepper; 
mix well and let all cook for about five 
minutes. Take three fine apples and cut 
them fine, carefully removing the cores, 
place them in a clean saucepan on the 
fire, with a half glassful of good White 
wine or the best Cider. Let this boil 
about five minutes, and then add the 
stuffing and mix well together. Then 
set the mixture to cool. Take the Hares 
^'rom the marinade and stuff the boned 
saddles very carefully and evenly, and 
give a nice round, even shape; tie them 
to keep them firm; then place a fine 
slice of bacon over each saddle, tying 
firmly. Cut up a carrot and onion into 
fine slices and place in the bottom of 
the roasting pan; lay the Hares over 
these and pour one' pint of consomme 
over the Hares. Place them in a hot 
oven and roast for three-quarters of an 
hour, basting frequently with their own 
gravy. Then remove from the oven and 
untie. Place the Hares on a hot dish 
nicely decorated with dice-shaped Crou- 
tons, and pour the gravy over the Hares 
and serve very hot.

a marinade with half a glass of White 
wine, one onion and one carrot, minced 
very fine. Let all steep together for two 
hours; then place the butter or lard in 
a baking dish, with an onion and carrot, 
sliced fine. Put the filets of Hare over 
this and set in the oven and let it cook 
for a half hour. Baste frequently with 
the Hares' own juices. Place the filets 
on a hot dish, add a tablespoonful of 



broth to the gravy in which the Hares 
were cooked; let all come to a boil on

CHAPTER XIX. 
BIBDS. 

Des Ciseaux. 



As already mentioned, Louisiana points 
w^ith pride to the quality and variety 
of the Birds found in her forests. Fine 
game birds are always heavy for their 
size; the flesh of the breas*, is plump 
and firm, and the skin clear. To be sure 
that the bird is fresh if purchased from 
dealers, pluck off a few feathers from 
the inside of the legs and around the 
vent; in a freshly-killed bird the flesh 
■will be fat and fresh-colored ; if the 
game has been hung a long time the 
flesh will be dark and dis?olored. These 
are infallible guides in selecting game 
birds. In serving birds, remember that 
young Green Peas, or "Petits Pois Fran- 
cais," as they are generally called, are 
nice entree for all birds. The following 
are the recognized Creole rules and meth- 
ods of preparing our delightful "Fanc> 
Game": 

Invariable Rule for Broiling: Birds. 
Ciseaux Grillees. 

Prepare the birds by hand picking. If 
of the very small variety, such as gras- 
sets. reed birds, robins, etc., do not^ick 



out the entrails, for there will be little 
left of the bird but a charred mass. Rub 
the bird well with salt and pepper, and 
then with melted butter. Tie a strip of 
very finely-sliced bacon around the body 
of the bird, joining with a skewer, and 
place on a broiler over a slow fire, and 
let it cook for ten, fifteen or twenty 
or even thirty minutes, according to the 
size of the bird. Turn frequently, so that 
it may cook well without burning. When 
done, take off the broiler. Have ready 
always buttered French toasts, and place 
the birds upon them, allowing a slice of 
toast for each bird. Trim away the 
rough edges of the toast. It is a matter 
of taste whether the strip of bacon be 
removed or not. But in the most ex- 
clusive homes of Creole New Orleans It 
is retained, being removed at the table 
by the person to whom it is served, the 
hot bacon keeping the bird hot, juicy and 
tender. Always pour over the bird a little 
of the juice that has run from it in 
broiling, and let it soak down into the 
toast. Pour over a little melted butter 
and chopped parsley, and lemon juice if 



91 



you like. Garnish with sliced lemon and 
parsley sprigs, and bring to the table 
hot. 

Invariable Rule for Boasting: Birds. 

Oiseaux Rotis. 
Prepare the birds in exactly the same 
manner as for broiling, cleaning oul tlie 
entrails of the larger birds, and leaving 
the small ones untouched, with the ex- 
ception of the Papabotte, the gizzards of 
which must never be eaten, for the Papa- 
botte is a very rich bird. Rub with salt 
and pepper and melted butter. In the 
larger birds, if you can afford it, put a 
truffle or two, for stuffing, and in all 
put a little lump of butter and a little 
salt and pepper, a pinch of chopped 
thyme, parsley and bay leaf, and a small 
pinch of the four spices, but very, very 
small indeed. Bind with strips of bacon, 
and place in a baking pan with a table- 
spoonful of butter. Let them bake or 
roast thirty minutes or less, according to 
size, and serve always on buttered 
French toast, over which you will pour, 
when you have placed the bird upon it 
a bit of the gravy made when cooking. 
Prepare this gravy by simply adding a 
tablespoonful of water, letting it cook 
"two minutes; then strain; let it cook 
for two minutes more, and pour upon the 
breast of the bird, so that it will soak 
down into the toast. Garnish nicely with 
sprigs of parsley and lemon, and serve 
hot. 

Bear in mind that all large game should 
be roasted; the small may be roasted or 
broiled, according to taste. 

PAPABOTTE, 

The Papabotte is one of our most 
recherche and distinctive birds. The Pa- 
pabotte is a summer bird, and is with 
us from the latter part of the month of 
June to September. The game laws are 
very strict, and it is not allowed to be 
killed out of season. The first Papa- 
bottes in the market, like the first Pom- 
pano, are much sought after. It is a rich 
bird, and is the joy of the ancient Creole 
gourmets. "Papabotte a la Creole!" — 
"Ah!" they will tell you, "you have a 
dish that is enough to make a dead man 
turn alive!" Thus prepared, the dish is 
sometimes called "a la Francais-Creole,'' 
not because the bird has been ever cooked 
by the French in their own domains, for 
Is is unknown in French forests, but be 
cause the Creoles, in cooking it to the 
best advantage, adopt the French dress 
ing, which will be explained in stuffing 
the bird, according to the subjoined dis- 
tinctive Creole recipe: 

Papabotte u, la Creole. 

Papabotte a la Creole. 

6 Papabottes. 6 Truffles. 
6 Thin Slices of Bacon. 6 Slices of Toast. 

3 Tablespoonfuls of Butter. 

3 Tablespoonfuls of Water. 
The Zest of a Lemon. The 'Juice of 1 

Lemon. 
Olives and Sprigs of Parsley to GarrSish. 
Clean the Papabotte as you would a 
chicken, and take out the entrails. Sep- 
arate the gizzards, and be sure to throw 
them away, retaining all the rest of the 
entrails for stuffing. Chop the remain- 
ing entrails very fine, and season well 
with salt and pepper. Fry them iri about 
a quarter of a spoon of butter. In the 
meantime take the Papabotte and rub 
well with salt and pepper, and put a 
small piece of butter, about the size 'bt a 
peanut, with a little salt and pepper, in 
the Papabotte. Place in the Interior one 



truffle. Bind a strip of thin bacon around 
the body. Place a tablespoonful of but- 
ter in a baking dish, and set the Papa- 
botte in it, and add about two tfible- 
spoonfuls of water. Set the dish in a 
quick oven, and let the birds roast thirty 
minutes, turning over once, so that they 
may be perfectly done. When the en- 
trails are done, add two inches of the 
zest of the lemon and a little juice. Take 
slices of toast, allowing one slice for each 
bird, and spread over each a coating of 
the entrails, or farcie. Place a bird on 
each slice of toast, after taking off tho 
binding of bacon, or leaving it on, ac 
cording to taste. Add one spoon of water 
to the gravy in which the Papabottes 
have been cooking, strain it, then warm 
for two minutes, and pour hot on top 
of the breast of the bird, allowing it to 
melt down into the French toasts. Gar- 
nish the dish nicely with sprigs of pars 
ley and olives, and serve hot.

the entrails, and be particularly careful 
to throw away the gizzard. Rub the 
birds with salt and pepper and then with 
melted butter. Tie a strip of very finely- 
sliced bacon around the body of each 
bird, joining the bacon with a skewer, 
and place the birds on a broiler over a 
slow fire and let them cook fifteen, 
twenty or even thirty minutes, accord- 
ing to the size of the birds. Turn fre 
quently, so that they may broil without 
burning. Wlien done, take off the broil- 
er; have ready the slices of buttered 
French toast, and place a bird upon each 
slice. Trim away the rough edges of the 
toast. Pour over the bir^s a little of tht 
juice that has run from them in broil - 
ing, and let this soak down into the toast. 
Pour over a little melted butter and 
chopped parsley, and add a little lemon 
jnice, if desired. Garnish with slices of 
Icinon and parsley sprigs and bring to

two into each Papabotte, if you can af- 
ford it, and put in each bird a little 
lump of butter about the size of a pea- 
nut, a pinch of salt and pepper, and a 
pinch of chopped thyme and parsley and 
bay leaf. Bind the birds with the strips 
of'bacon and place in a baking pan with 
a tablespoonful of butter. Let them bake 
or roast for thirty minutes or less, ac- 
cording to size. When done, place each 
bird on a slice of buttered French toast, 
and, when you have placed the bird thus.

pour over a bit of the gravy which you 
will have made by adding to the birds 
while cooking, and Just four minutes 
before serving add a lablespoonful of 
water, letting It cook for two minutes; 
then strain this gravy, and let It cook 
two minutes more. Pour a little over

It may be stuffed with truffles or any 
stuffing, such as oysters or egg, an! 
served on toast, as indicated in the re- 
cipes for broiling and roasting birds. 

The term "Perdreaux" is applied by the 
French to young Partridges, and "Per- 
drix" to the older birds. In the young 
birds the tips of the long wing feathers 
are pointed; in the old birds the tips of 
the wing feathers are round.

Then truss them neatly, rub with salt 
and pepper and butter and place in a 
roasting pan. In the meantime take a 
fine, tender head of cabbage, clean thor- 
oughly and cut into four parts. Wash 
the cabbage well in cold water and put 
into boiling salted water for five min- 
utes. Then take the cabbage out of the 
water and drain well; make a hollow 
in the center of each piece of cabbage; 
place within the partridges, cover with 
the other pieces and tie together. Put in 
a saucepan the quarter of a pound of salt 
pork which has been well scalded and 
washed of all salt and cut into six slices. 
Add one carrot cut into four pieces, one 
whole onion into which you will have 
stuck four cloves, the herb bouquet, the 
sausage and one pint each of white veal 
broth or chicken broth, and one pint of 
water or beef broth. Season with a small 
pinch of salt, and a good pinch of pepper,

tion. Put the partridges in the oven and 
let them roast for ten minutes. Then 
remove and take the cabbage from the 
mixture, make a hollow in the center of 
the cabbage, place within the partridges 
and cover with the remaining portion of 
cabbage; tie each half separately to- 
gether; then return to the saucepan, plac- 
ing a piece of buttered paper over to 
keep all air from escaping. Put the lid 
on the saucepan, set in the oven and let 
the partridges cook thus for an hour. 
Remove the lid and paper, skim off all 
that may adhere to the surface, drain the 
cabbage and slice; dress neatly on a hot 
dish. Untruss the partridges and lay 
them on the cabbage, placing on each 
dressed section a piece of sliced boiled 
pork, a sausage cut in half; slice the car- 
rots nicely in round pieces, and use these 
as a decoration, placing them artisti- 
cally around the dish. Strain the sauce 
in which the partridges were cooked and 
let it reduce slightly. Serve with the cab- 
bage and partridge, bringing it to the 
table in a separate bowl and pouring 
over the cabbage when serving.

Breasts of Partridge Truffle Sauce. 

Supreme de Perdreaux, Sauce Perigueux. 

3 Fine Young Partridges. 3 Truffles. 

12 Mushrooms. 

1-2 Glass of Madeira "Wine. 

2 Ounces of Chicken Forcemeat. 

A Pint of Sauce a la Hollandaise. 

2 Gills of White Wine. 

Clean, singe, draw and wipe the part- 
ridges carefully. Then remove the skin 
from the breasts. By a delicate manipu- 
lation with a very sharp, small knife 
make an incision on the top of each 
breastbone from end to end and _ cut 
off the entire breast, including the wing 
bone, from the carcass. Carefully re- 
move the small filet which lies under 
each breast and place on a dish aside for 
further use. Then cut an incision two 
inches square and one inch in depth into 
each breast, on the inner side. Rub well 
with salt and pepper, and stuff the In- 
cision with two tablespoonfuls of chicken 
forcemeat, to which has been added six 
finely-chopped mushrooms and two thin- 
ly-sliced truffles. Butter the inside of a 
tin saucepan and lay the six breasts very 
carefully within. Then take each of the 
six small filets that have been laid aside; 
rub them well with salt and pepper and 
make a small incision on the top of each 
and place within a thin slice of truffle 
and brush lightly with melted butter. 
Lay these filets lightly on. top of each 
of the breasts, and again brush lightly 
with melted butter. These filets and 
breasts thus arranged constitute su- 
premes. Pour into the pan a half glass 
of Madeira wine and two tablespoonfuls 
of the chicken liquor, cover the pan 
tightly and place in a hot oven for fif- 
teen minutes. 

Take one pint of Hollandaise Sauce, 
add one finely-minced truffle and a half 
dozen minced mushrooms and two gills 
of Whiite wine. Place the sauce In a 
saucepan of hot boiling water and let 
the sauce heat well without boiling. Pour 
this sauce into a hot dish and then take 
the pan with the partridges out of the 
oven, remove the breasts and filets, or 
"supremes," place them on the dish with 
the sauce, garnish nicelv with Croutons

Cailles. 

The Quail is a most delicious and 
tempting bird. It delights the most fas- 



tidious, and that famous preparation, 
"Quail on Toast," or- "Cailles sur Ca- 
napes," is a dish that no great dining is 
considered complete without, when quail 
are in season. 

We have two kinds of quail, the blue 
and the yellow spotted, or pivele. Both 
are excellent. If purchased in the mar- 
ket or city stores, see that the skin is 
clear and the breasts full and tender. 
The Quail is either broiled or roasted, 
following exactly the same directions 
given in the recipes for broiling and 
roasting. In broiling, allow from twelve 
to fifteen minutes. In roasting, from 
twenty to twenty-five. Always cook slow- 
ly on a slow fire. 

Roasted Quail. 

Cailles Roties. 

6 Quails. 
1 Tablespoonful of Butter. 

1 Tablespoonful of Water. 

The Juice of 1 Lemon. 6 Slices of Toast. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

Sliced Lemon and Parsley Sprigs, or 

Watercress to Garnish. 

Select six fine, fat, tender Quail. Pick, 
singe, clean and wipe them well. Butter 
the inside of each Quail nicely and sprin- 
kle lightly within with salt and pepper. 
Rub lightly on the , "outside with butter, 
then truss the bird and bind the body 
round with a thin strip of bacon. Put 
a tablespoonful of butter in a roasting 
pan and set the birds in the pan and 
cook in the oven from twenty to thirty 
minutes, according to size. Have ready 
the buttered toast. Place on a hot dish, 
lay a bird on each slice of toast. Add a 
little butter to the gravy in which the 
Quails have been roasted, a tablespoon- 
ful of water and the juice of one lemon. 
Let this cook for three or four minutes, 
strain and set on the stove for two min- 
utes longer and pour over the breast of 
the birds so that it will soak into the 
bread. Garnish the dish nicely with pars- 
ley and sliced lemon or sliced lemon and 
watercress, and send to the table hot. 
WTien served with a garnish of water- 
cress the dish is called "Cailles aux Ores- 
sons." 

Quail Roasted in Grape Leaves. 

Cailles de Laurier aux Feuilles de Vignes. 

6 Fine Quails. 

2 Tablespoonfuls of Butter. 

1 Tablespoonful of Water. The Juice o^ 

1 Lemon 

6 Slices of Buttered Toast. 12 Grape 

Leaves. 

Green Grape Jelly. 

Follow the directions given in the above 
recipe for roasting Quails, only do not 
wrap the Quails in strips of bacon. In- 
stead, rub the bodies well with butter 
and then envelop the birds in fresh grape 
leaves; set in a baking pan and proceed 
to roast according to the directions given 
above. Garnish a dish nicely with fresh 
young grape leaves, place the Quails 
on slices of toast and lay upon the leavea 
and send the dish to the table hot. Serve 
the Quails with Green Grape Jelly. This 
is, of course, a rare dish, and can only 
be served at the season when the grape 
vine is in leaf. It is much affected at 
such times by epicures, but it .is a dish 
within the reach of any who may have a 
grape vine near. The grape leaves im- 
part a very peculiar and grateful flavor 
to the Quail.

6 Fine, Tender Quails. 

2 Tablespoonfuls of Butter. 

1 Tablespoonful of Water. 6 Truffles. 

S Thin Strips of Bacon. The Juice of 1 

Lemon. 
Parsley Sprigs and Sliced Lemon to Gar- 
nish. 

To make this delicious dish, clean the 
Quail and butter inside and throw in a 
little salt and pepper. Stuff with truf- 
fles, and bind the body, after rubbing, 
with a strip of bacon. Set in the oven 
in a baking pan in which you have 
placed a tablespoonful of butter, and let 
it roast twenty or thirty minutes, accord- 
ing to size. Have ready buttered toast. 
Put the birds on the toast. Add a little 
butter to the gravy in which they have 
been roasted, and a tablespoonful of 
water, and the juice of a lemon. Let this 
cook for three or four minutes, strain, set 
on the stove for two minutes longer, and 
pour over the breast of the bird, so that 
it will soak into the bread, and serve 
with a nice garnish of parsley and sliced 
lemon, and with green peas as an efitree.

6 Fine, Fat Quaijs. 6 Strips of Bacon. 

2 Tablespoonfuls of Butter. 6 Slices of 

Buttered Toast. 

The Juice of 1 Lemon.

Rub the bird well with salt and pepper, 
and then with melted butter. Tie a strip 
of very finely-sliced bacon around the 
body of the bird, joining with a skewer, 
and place on a broiler over a slow fire, 
and let it cook for ten, fifteen or twenty, 
or even thirty minutes, according to the 
size of the bird. Turn frequently, so that 
it may cook well without burning. When 
done take off the broiler. Have ready al- 
ways buttered French toasts, and place 
the birds upon them, allowing a slice of 
toast for each bird. Trim away the rough 
edges of the toast. It is a matter of taste 
whether the strip of bacon be removed or 
not. But at the most elegant dinings in 
Creole New Orleans it is retained, being 
removed at the table by the person to 
whom it is served, the hot bacon keep- 
ing the bird hot, juicy and tender. Al- 
ways pour over the bird a little of the 
juice that has run from it in broiling, 
and let it soak down into the toast. Four 
over a little melted butter and chopped 
parsley, and lemon juice, if vou like. Gar- 
nish with sliced lemon and parsley sprigs, 
and bring to the table hot.

WOODCOCK. 

Becasse. 

The "Becasse" is a rare bird. It is in 
season from December till April. In pur- 
chasing see that the skin is clear, the 
breasts firm and plump and the wings 
tender to the touch. 

Pluck and clean, but never draw these 
birds. The olden epicurean ideas of Cre- 
ole cookery forbid this. If you were to 
serve the Becasse to an old Creole bon 
vivant without the entrails he would con- 
sider it quite shocking, and his indigna- 
tion would vent itself immediately in 
unmistakable terms. The "Becasse" is al- 
ways broiled or roasted and served on 
buttered French toast. If roasted, al- 
ways put, if you can. one truffle in "the 
body as a stuffing, and when serving 
a little melted butter on top of the breast.

butter, put a truffle in each bird for 
stuffing, and in all put a little lump of 
butter and a little salt and pepper, a 
pinch of chopped thyme, parsley and bay 
leaf, and a small pinch of the four spices, 
but very, very small, indeed. Truss neat- 
ly. Bind with strips of bacon, and place 
in a baking pan with a tablespoonful of 
butter. Let them bake or roast thirly 



96 



minutes or less, according to size; remove 
from the oven and place on buttered 
French toast on a hot dish, cover and set 
over a pot of boiling water to keep warm. 
Prepare gravy by simply adding a table- 
spoonful of water to the gravy made 
when cooking the birds, let it cook for 
two minutes; then strain; let it cook for 
two minutes more and pour upon the 
breast of the bird so that it will soaii 
down into the toast. Garnish nicely 
with sprigs of parsley and lemon, and 
serve hot. 

Broiled Woodcock on Toast,

sliced bacon around the body of the bird, 
joining with a skewer, and place on a 
broiler over a slow fire, and let it ?fook 
for ten, fifteen or twenty, or even thirty 
minutes, according to the size of the bird. 
Turn frequently so that it may cook 
well without burning. When done take 
off the broiler. Have ready always but- 
tered French toasts, and place the birds 
upon them, allowing a slice of toast for 
each bird. Trim away the rough edges 
of the toast. Always pour over the bird 
a little of the Juice that has run from it 
in tiroiling, and let it soak down into 
the toast. Four over a little melted but- 
ter and chopped parsley, and lemon juice, 
if you like. Garnish with sliced lemon 
and parsley sprigs, and bring to the table 
hot. In cooking, and in serving, follow 
the "Invariable Rule for Broiling Birds." 
(See recipe.) 

SNIPE. 

Becassine. 

The Snipe is one of our finest birds, 
and is much sought after by epicures. 
But the glory , of our Louisiana forests 
is that the rich gifts of nature may be 
had by the poor as well as the millionaire. 

The Becassine is a welcome dish at 
the most exclusive tables. It is a winter 
bird, and is with us from December till 
April, as also the "Becasse," or "W^ood- 
cock." If you tell an old Creole that you 
are going to treat him to "Becassines" or 
"Becasses," he will smack his lips and 
say: "Ah! you are a connoisseur." 

"Becassines" are either roasted or 
broiled; follow implicitly the directions 
given in the rules for broiling and roast- 
ing birds. Serve in the same manner, 
with a garnish of cresses or parsley, and 
always on buttered French toasts. In 
selecting Snipe, see that the flesh is clear 
and firm and the breasts full and ten- 
der.

bird for stuffing, and in all put a little 
lump of butter and a little salt and pep- 
per, a pinch of chopped tnyme,' parsley 
and bay leaf, and a small plncli of the 
four sptces, but very, very small, indeed. 
Bind with strips of bacon, and place 
in a baking pan with a tablespoonful of 
butter. Let them roast thirty minutes 
or less, according to size, then remove 
and place always on buttered French 
toast on a hot dish, and cover ana set 
over a pot of boiling water to keep warm 
and juicy. Meanwhile prepare a gravy 
by simply adding a tablespoonful of wa- 
ter to the gravy made in cooking the 
birds; let it cook for t'wo minutes; then 
strain; let it cook for two minutes more 
and pour a little upon the breast of each 
bird, so that it will soak down into the 
toast. Garnish nicely with sprigs of 
parsley or watercress and slices of lemon,

"Invariable Rule for. Broiling Birds." 
(See recipe.) 

Rub the bird well with salt and pepper, 
and then with melted butter. Tie a strip 
of very finely-sliced bacon around the 
body of the bird, joining with a skewer, 
and place on a broiler over a slow fire 
and let it cook for ten, fifteen or twenty, 
or even thirty minutes, according to the 
size of the bird. Turn frequently, so 
that it may cook well without burning. 
When done take off the broiler. Have 
ready always buttered French toasts, and 
place the birds upon them, allowing a 
slice of toast for each bird. Trim away 
the rough edges of the toast. It la a 
matter of taste whether the strip of bacon 
be removed or not. Always pour over 
the bird a little of the juice that has 
run from it in broiling, and let it soak 
down into the toast. Pour over a little 
melted butter and chopped oarsley, and 
lemon juice It you like. Garnish with 
sliced lemon and parsley sprigs, and

Grassets, Kecd Birds, Koblns, Larks, 
Broiled or Roasted 

Grassets, Ortolans, Grives, Alouettes, 
Grillees ou Rotls.

2 Tablespoonfuls of Butter. 

6 or 8 Strips of Bacon. Salt and Pepper 

to Taste. 

Sliced Lemon and Sprigs of Parsley or 

Watercress to Garnish. 

Grassets, Reed Birds, Robins and Larks 
are delightful small game that come in 
the summer. Thev are with us from July, 
through October. The Reed Birds, or 
Ortolans, are the terror of the rice plant- 
ers of Louisiana. They peck at the rice 
and spoil the growth, and are, conse- 
quently, shot in this season, when the 
rice is maturing, in order to rid the rice 
fields of their presence. They are deli- 
cate eating, as are also the Louisiana 
Robins, Larks, and the Grassets, which 
latter are fat, plumpy birds of the Robin 
order. The name Grasset is given to in- 
dicate fatness and plumpness. These 
birds are always broiled or roasted, fol- 
lowing the invariable rules laid down 
above. They should be broiled over a 
clear fire, and do not require much more 



97 



than fiye minutes to broil; ten minutes 
to roast in a quick oven. Serve, whether 
broiled or roasted, on buttered French 
toast, and garnish with cresses or pars- 
sprigs. All these little birds should be 
broiled "en brochette," that is, a skewer 
should be run through the body. Salt 
and pepper after, and pour melted butter 
and chopped parsley over them. If roast- 
ed, they may be served with a brown 
gravy. 

POUIES D'EAU. 

Poules d'Eau. 

2 Pairs of Poules d'Eau. 
6 Turnips. 1 Tablespoonful of Butter. 

1 Tablespoonful of Flour. 

2 Onions, Chopped Fine. 

1 Square Inch of Ham, Minced Fine. 

1 Bay Leaf. 1 Clove of Garlic. 

3 Sprigs Each of Thyme and Parsley. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

The poule d'Eau is a species of water 
duck, resembling both a chicken Etnd a 
duck. The Creoles gave it the name of 
"Poules d'Eau," or "Water Chicken." As 
it lives entirely in the water and marsh- 
es, never coming on dry land, it is classed 
by the Creoles among the fish and served 
as a Friday or fast-day dish. It makes a 
very delightful entree, either stewed plain 
or with turnips. It is never cooked in 
any other way. As it feeds much on flsu, 
It often has the flavor of fish. In the 
hands of an inexperienced cook it is 
sometimes unpalatable on that account 
Before cooking parboil a few minutes if 
there is the slightest odor of fish; add a 
small peeled carrot or onion to the water 
and this will absorb the flavor of fish. 

Stewed Poules d'Eau. 

Poules d'Eau a la Creole. 

1 Pair of Poules d'Eau. 

1 Square Inch of Ham. 2 Onions. 

1 Tablespoonful of Butter. 1 Clove of 

Garlic. 

1 Herb Bouquet, Chopped Very Fine. 

1 Glass of Claret. 1 Cup of Water. 

1 Can of Mushrooms. 

Clean and pick the Poules d'Eau nicely. 
Cut into joints or stew whole, as desired. 
The Creoles generally out them into joints. 
Rub well with salt and pepper. Chop two 
onions very fine. Put them into the stew- 
pan with a tablespoonful of melted but-, 
ter, and let them brown slightly. Then 
add the well-seasoned ducks. Let these 
brown well, and add the one square-inch 
of finely-minced ham. (Omit the ham on 
fast days.) Add the clove of garlic and 
two sprigs each of thyme, parsley and 
one bay leaf, minced very fine. Let this 
brown with the Poules d'Eau, stirring 
frequently, and then pour over one good 
glass of Claret. Let this simmer for ten 
minutes, stirring constantly, so that it 
will not burn, and add one cup of boiling 
water. Season well to taste, and let them 
simmer well for about an hour. Serve 
hot with Croutons for a garnish. 

Stewed Poules d'Eau With Turnips. 

Salmi de Poules d'Eau aux Navets. 

1 Pair of Poules d'Eau. 

6 Turnips. 
1 Tablespoonful of Butter.

1 Square Inch of Ham, Minced Very Fine. 

1 Bay Leaf. 1 Tablespoonful of Flour. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 1 Clove of 

Garlic. 

S Sprigs Each of Thytne and Parsley. 



This is the most delightful way of cook- 
ing Poules d'Eau. The tui^nip blends well 
with the flavor, and a nicer way of 
serving this vegetable in combination 
does not exist. Clean the Poules d'Eau 
and cut into pieces at the joints. Put 
a tablespoonful of butter into the_ pot, 
and as it melts add the onions, chopped 
fine. Let this brown and then add the 
pieces of Poules d'Eau. Let them brown, 
and add the minced ham. (Omit the ham 
on fast days.) Immediately after add the 
turnips, sliced or cut in quarters, and a 
tablespoonful of sifted flour. Stir well, 
let it brown slightly, and add the minced 
thyme, parsley and bay leaf, and one 
clove of garlic, minced very fine. Stir 
well again, and let it smother for about 
fifteen minutes, stirring frequently, so 
that it will not burn. Then add water al- 
most sufficient to cover the Poules d'Eau. 
and stir well. Cover tight and let the 
mixture smother for a half hour longer. 
Tou will have one of the nicest dishes 
that ever graced a table. 
Game Pie. 
Pate de Gibier. 

1 Dozen Small Birds. 1 Dozen Eggs. 
A Rich Pie Crust. 1 Dozen Hard-Boiled 
Eggs. 
2 Cups of Egg Dressing. 
Salt and Pepper to Taste. 
Take one dozen small birds. Snipe, 
Quail, Woodcock, etc., and clean well, 
inside and out. Stuff each one with a 
dressing the same as for turkey, using 
either egg or oysters as desired. Loosen 
the joints with a knife, but do not sep- 
arate them. Put them in a stewpan, with 
water enough to cover them, and let them 
cook till nearly tender. Then season with 
salt and pepper again and two table- 
spoonfuls of butter. Thicken the gravy 
with one tablespoonful of flour, let cook 
for ten minutes more and then remove 
and set to cool. Butter a pudding dish 
and line the sides with a rich pie crust 
(see recipe). Have ready the hard-boiled 
eggs, cut in slices. Put in a layer of tho 
eggs and a layer of the birds until the 
dish is full. Pour over the gravy and 
then cover the pie with a crust and bake 
to a light brown. 

The pie may also be mad% very nicely 
by stewing the birds as one would a 
chicken (see recipe), and then line a pie 
pan with a rich pie crust; bake lightlj-, 
fill in with the stewed birds, pour over 
the gravy, place a cover of the pie crust 
on top, set in the oven and bake to a 
light brown. 

Chand-EToid of Game. 
Chaud-Froid de Gibier. 
The Breasts of 3 Ducks, or 1 Dozen 
Breasts of Small Game. 
1 Cup of Chicken Forcemeat. 
2 Tablespoonfuls of Butter. 
1 Pint of Aspic Jelly. 
1 Pint of Poulette Sauce. 
3 Truffles. Watercress to Garnish. 
This is a most recherche dish, seldom 
made in these days on account rtf the 
cost, but in old Creole days it was a 
standing dish at every great feast. It 
may be made with Canvasback or 
French or Teal Duck, or with Wood- 
cock, Snipe and other small game. The 
dish demands such beautiful decoration 
that it requires an artist to make a real 
Creole Chaud-Froid. 

Clean the ducks or game or spring 
chicken, if the latter is used; wash ana 
truss neatly. Then wrap in buttered pa- 
per and smother according to recipe for 
Smothered Chicken (see recipe). When 



98 



done take out of the paper and separate 
the breasts of the game or chicken from 
the legs. Trim them neatly and stuff 
the portion between the breasts proper 
and the filets with a chicken forcemeat. 
(See recipe.) Mix together equal parts of 
Aspic Jelly and Poulette Sauce. (See re- 
cipes.) Stir till thick and surround with 
crushed ice. Then dip the breasts of the 
game or chicken into this mixture. Take 
a fine baking sheet or dish and arrange 
the breasts in fanciful or pyramidal 
figures on this dish, and when set dec- 
orate them nicely with sliced truffles 
and the remaining sauce that has been 
poured into timbale molds that have been 



previously lined with Aspic Jelly, and 
which have become set. Decorate nicely 
with these timbales of Aspic and Foulettie 
Sauce, and garnish the dish with Crou- 
tons, on which you will have placed por- 
tions of Aspic Jelly. Decorate the edges 
of the dish with watercress, and place on 
the table cold. Wlien ready to serve, 
serve a portion of the breast of the duck 
or the entire breast of the small game 
on a Crouton of Aspic Jelly, with the 
timbale turned out on the end of the 
chicken or game and the other end gar- 
nished with watercress. If chickens are 
used be careful to have spring chickens 
of one and a half pounds in "weight. 



CHAPTER XX. 

(STUFFING AND DRESSING FOB POVI^TRY, GAME, FISH, ETC. 

FOBOEMEAT. 

Des Farcies — Des Quenelles. 



The Creoles claim that oysters, eggs, 
chestnuts or truffles are the only ele- 
gant dressings for poultry or game, and 
oysters or egg stuffing for fish. The fol- 
lowing are the methods of preparing these 
dressings: 

Oyster Dressing. 

Farci aux Huitres. 

2 Dozen Oysters. 

1 Cup of Bread, Wet and Squeezed. 

1 Onion, Chopped Very Fine. 

1-2 Square-Inch Ham. 1 Tablespoontul 

Butter. 

1-2 Teaspoonful of Sage. 

1 Sprig Each of Thyme, Parsley and Bay 

Leaf, Minced Very Fine. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

Wet the soft of the bread and squeeze 
thoroughly till you have one cup, judging 
the quantity of stuffing always by the 
size of the tfiwl to be stuffed, and adding 
more in proportion, if needed. Season 
the bread well with salt and pepper, and 
add the minced herbs, mixing well. Take 
a tablespoonful of butter and put in the 
frying pan. As it melts add the onion, 
which must be chopped very fine. Let 
this brown for about five minutes, and 
while frying add the bread and stir well. 
Then add the square inch of ham, minced 
very fine. Mix well and let all fry well. 
Season again to taste. Then add the two 
dozen oysters, cut in two, with all the 
hard portions taken off. Mix all well, 
and fry for a few minutes longer. Then, 
if you prefer a dry dressing, place the 
pan in the oven and let the dressing bake 
for ten minutes. If you prefer, as many 
do, the moister and richer dressing stuff 
the fowl or fish immediately, and pro- 
ceed to bake. Arrange and bake the fowl 
as in the directions on these special sub- 
jects. Twice the above quantity of bread 
will be needed, and perhaps a little more, 
in stuffing turkey. Nothing is more ele- 
gant or recherche than an oyster dress- 
ing. The flavor of sag© Is very much 
liked by some and disliked by others. 
Ir used — and the Creoles always use it- 
add a teaspoonful sifted, and mix thoi- 
oughly with the bread before putting it 
in the frying pan, if two cups of dressing 
are used, and less for one cup, in pro- 
portion. 



Oyster StQffins for Poultry, 

Farci d'Huitres. 

All depends upon the size of the fowl. 
For the ordinary-sized fifteen or sixteen- 
pound turkey take 

3 Dozen Oysters. 

1 Quart of Stale Bread, Wet and 

Squeezed. 

1 Tablespoonful of Butter. 

1 Tablespoonful of Parsley. 

1 Sprig of Thyme. 

1 Bay Leaf. 3 Tablespoonfuls of Sage. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

Drain the oysters; wet the stale bread 
with - hot water, squeezing thoroughly. 
Chop fine the liver and gizzard of the 
fowl, and put a tablespoonful of lard into 
the frying pan. Mix in the chopped onions 
and add the chopped liver and gizzard. 
As it begins to brown, throw in the 
chopped herbs, and then add the bread, 
which has been mixed well and seasoned 
with the chopped sage. Mix well. Add 
to this one tablespoonful of butter and 
stir, blending all thoroughly. Now add 
the pint or so of oyster water, and as it 
is reduced mix in the oysters. Stir for 
three or four minutes and take off and 
dress the fowl. This dressing is highly 
recommended. 



Staffing of Trnffles. 

Farci aux Truffes. 

1-4 Can of Truffles. 
1 Cup of Bread, Wet and Squeezed. 
1 Onion, Chopped Very Fine. 
1-2 Square Inch of Ham. 1 Tablespoon- 
ful of Butter. 
21-2 Teaspoonfuls of Sage. 
1 Sprig Each of Thyme, Parsley and Bay 
Leaf, Minced Very Fine. 
Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

Proceed in exactly the same manner M 
for egg or oyster stuffing, using a quar- 
ter of a can of truffles chopped, instead 
of the oysters or egg. But bear in mind 
that this is an expensive stuffing. Some 
fastidious epicures stuff the fowl entirely 
with truffles, but this will make the disb 
of turkev dressed In such manner cost 
at least $10.

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

Wet the bread and squeeze thoroughly. 
Chop the eggs fine and mix with the 
bread. Mince the herbs and add. Season 
well with salt and pepper. Chop the 
onion and fry it in one tablespoonful of 
butter. As it browns add the bread. Into 
which you have mixed the sifted sage, if 
desired. Add, as it fries, the half square- 
inch of ham, minced very fine. Season 
again to taste, and let all fry about ten 
minutes. Take off the stove and stuff 
the fowl or fish and proceed with the ar- 
rangement for baking. Egg dressing Is 
a very nice stuffing for fish, if oysters 
cannot be had. 

Stuffing for Ducks.

1 Tablespoonful -ot Butter. 

1-2 Teaspoonful of Sage. 

1 Sprig Each of Thyme, Parsley and Bay 

Leaf, Minced Very Fine. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

The Creoles generally stuff the do- 
mestic duck when roasted, using an oys- 
ter stuffing. (See recipe.) But many hold 
that the flavor of the wild duck is finer 
when not stuffed. This is a matter of 
taste. The wild duck stuffed with oys- 
ters is a most delectable dish. 

Ducks may be stuffed with truffles. 
This is much affected by epicures _when 
serving the famous Mallard or Canvas- 
back Ducks at great dinings. But a 
duck stuffed with truffles is a very ex- 
pensive dish. 

The domestic duck is always roasted 
and stuffed. Serve with Currant Pelly. 

Stuffing for Goose. 

Farci Pour I'Oie. 

1 Cup of Mashed Potatoes. 4 Apples. 

4 Onions. 1-2 Teaspoonful Powdered 

Sage. 

1-2 Teaspoonful of Thyme. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

Any stuffing used in baking a turkey 
may be used for roast goose, such as 
oyster or egg, etc. But the following is 
an excellent special dressing and seems 
to bring out more than any other the 
flavor of the goose: 

Take one cup of mashed potatoes, four 
apples (peeled nicely and cored), and 
four onions; one-half teaspoonful of sage, 
powdered well; one-half teaspoonful of 
thyme, and pepper and salt to taste. 
Place the apples and onions and herbs in 
a saucepan and add water sufficient to 
cover nicely. I^et all cook together till 
soft. Then mash well and rub through 
a sieve. Add the cup of mashed pota- 
toes and mix well, seasoning with salt 
and pepper. Stuff the body and craw, 
sew up and truss the goose, and bake 
according to recipe. (See recipe for 
"Roast Goose.")

CHAPTER XXI. 
SAUCES FOB FISH, MEATS, POULTRY, GAME, ETC. 

Des Sauces Pour les Poissons des Viandes, la Volaille. le Gibier, etc. 



■ ■ The Creoles, like therr French ances- 
tors, hold that the three mother sauces, 
or "Sauces Meres," are Brown Sauce, or 
"Sauce Espagnole"; the White Sauce, or 
"Sauce Allemande," and the "Glace," or 
"Glaze." These are the foundation of all 
sauces, and upon their successful making 
depends the taste and piquancy of the 
numberless variety of fancy sauces that 
give to even the most commonplace dish 
an elegatice all Its own. The Creoles are 
famous for their splendid sauces, and the 
perfect making of a good sauce is con- 
sidered an indispensable part of culinary 
art and- domestic economy. The fir.st 
thing to learn in making sauces of ever>' 
kind is how to make a good "Roux," or 
the foundation mixture of flour and but- 
ter, or flour and lard. We have tho 
Brown Roux and the White Roux. In 
making a Brown Roux, this unfailing 



rule must be the guide; Never, under any 
consideration, use burnt or over-browned 
flour. 

Brown Bonx. 
Roux Brun. 
1 Tablespoonful Butter. 1 Tablespoonful 
Flour. 
In making the roux. which is the foun- 
dation of a fancy sauce, melt the table- 
spoonful of butter slowly, and add grad- 
ually the flour, sprinkling it in and 
stirring constantly, till every portion is 
a nice, delicate brown. Never make It 
too brown, because it must continue 
browning as the other ingredients are 
added in the order given in every reclpo 
In this book. It is a great mistake to 
pile ,all ingredients, one after anothel\ 
pell-mell, into a dish, in the course of 
preparation. The secret of good cooking 



101 



liea in following implicitly the gradual 
introduotion of the component parts in 
the order specified. 

■ In making a roux for cooking gravicb 
or smothering meats, the proportions are 
one tablespoonful of lard and two oi 
flour, butter always making a richer 
gravy than lard, and sometimes being too 
rich for delicate stomachs. It is a greai 
fad among many in our day to use notn 
Ing but butter in cooking. The Creoles 
hold that butter should be used in its 
proper place, and lard in its own. The 
lard is not only less expensive, but is 
far preferable to an inferior quality or 
butter, and in many cases preferable to 
the best butter, according to the dish in 
course of preparation. Properly made, 
the taste of lard can never be detected, 
and it is feared that butter is used by 
many to cover up, by its taste, the de- 
ficiencies of having made the roux im- 
properly. If there is the slightest indi- 
cation of burnt odor or overbrowning, 
throw the roux away and wash the uten- 
sil before proceeding lo make another. 
Remember that even a slightly burnt 
sauce will spoil the most savory dish. 

White Roux. 

Roux Blanc. 

1 Tablespoonful Butter. 1 Tablespoonful 
Flour. 

The White Roux is made exactly like 
the BrOwn Roux, only that the butter 
and flour are put simultaneously into 
the saucepan, and not allowed to brown. 
It is then moistened with a little broth 
or boiling water, and allowed to boil a 
few minutes till thick. The White Roux 
is the foundation of all white sauces, or 
those containing milk and cream. It id 
also used in nearly all purees. In the 
Sauce Veloute it should be colored. 

GI/AZi: 

Glace. 

5 Pounds Rump of Beef. 5 Pounds of 

Bones. 

2 Calf's Feet. 

1 Large Herb Bouquet. 1 Stalk of Celery. 

3 Large Carrots. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

Glace is the foundation of all sauces 
for roasts, filets, etc. In other words, 
it is 'LieWg's Beef Extract, which every 
housekeeper may make and keep on hand 
for gravies for meats. It is made as fol- 
lows: Roast five pounds of the rump of 
the- beef. Take five or six pounds of 
bones of beef and two calf's feet. After 
roasting the beef well and brown, but 
rare, chop it in small pieces, and put in 
a pot with two gallons of water. Add to 
this the bones and calf's feet, all raw. 
Then add a large herb bouquet, and one 
stalk of celery and three large carrots. 
Let the whole come to a boil. As the 
scum rises skim, and then season with 
salt and pepper to taste. Let all boil til) 
reduced to' one quart. Strain this, and 
it will make a jelly or glace whjai cold: 
Do not add any flour or grease. Tl^Jgoodi 
Creoles cook considers it little short of a 
crime to add flour to the gravies of roast 
or broiled beef. This glace is then used 
as a "demi-glace" for sauces for sweet- 
breads, when they are prepared in sautes, 
filets of beef, etc. In making this "demi- 
glace," take one tablespoonful of the 
glace, and add a spoonful of Madeira or 
Sherry wine. It should always be a light 
sauce. Use this for thickening Sauce Es- 
pagnole. .- ■ 



Anchovy Sauce. 
Sauce auX Beurre d'Anchois. 

1 Tablespoonful of Anchovy Butter. 

11-2 Tablespoonfuls Flour. 
1 1-2 Tablespoonfuls Butter. 

Make a White Sauce (see recipe), and 
add to this a tablespoonful of Anchovy 
butter, "Which comes prepared. Let it 
melt, season to taste in the sauce, and 
serve. An Anchovy Sauce may be either 
brown or white. Serve with boiled fish. 

Apple Saucce 

Sauce JVIarmalade de Pommes. 

6 Large Apples.

stirring frequently, to prevent burning-. 
Add the ground cloves and the stick of 
cinnamon, ground fine. Let them boil 
at least three-quarters of an hour, mash- 
ing as they become tender. Then take 
off the fire and press them through a 
coarse sieve. Add sugar to taste, add 
the butter, and set all back on the fire, 
and let it simmer gently for five minutes 
longer. Set to cool in a dish, and serve 
with Roast Pork or Roast Goose. The 
sauce must not scorch, or the taste will 
be spoiled. 

Bearnaise Sauce. 
Sauce Bearnaise. 

6 Shallots. . 1-2 Clove of Garlic. 
1-2 Gill of French Vinegar. 
1 Tablespoonful Each of Flour and 
Butter.

very fine. Blend the butter and flour, 
or take a good tablespoonful of Glace 
(see recipe), and moisten with a table- 
spoonful of White wine and good white 
consomme, till you have about a pint. 
Set on the stove, in a porcelain-lined 
saucepan. Add the pepper and salt and 
butter, and a quarter of a teaspoonful 
of grated nutmeg. Add half a gill of 
vinegar and the juice of a lemon, accord- 
ing to taste and acidity. When of the 
consistency approaching starch, take 
from the fire and add the yolks of four 
eggs, beaten well, and stirring all the 
time, till you have the consistency of a 
thick starch. Serve immediately, with 
broiled steak, broiled chops, broiled fish, 
etc. 

Bechamel Sauce. 
Sauce Bechamel. 

2 Ounce.' of Raw Ham. 2 Fresh Mush- 
rooms. 
1 Tablespoonful of Butter.

melts add the chopoed onion, and let it 
stew until very tender, but do not let it 
brown. Mince the ham and cut the vege- 
tables verv fine, and add first the ham, 
letting it brown a minute, and then the 
vegetables, herbs and spices. Let ail 
simmer gently for ten minutes, without' 
■browning. Add the Veloutee Sauce (see 
recipe),, stir in well, and bring all to a 



102 



boll. Let it boil ten minutes, and be sure 
to stir constantly. Then add, by gentle 
degrees, the cream, which should not be 
heated, but which must be very rich and 
sweet (if not perfectly sweet it will spoil 
the sauce). When all this is blended, 
the sauce is of a velvet smoothness, and 
very delicious. Strain and set on the 
fire a minute longer to heat, and serve 
hot. It is served with fish, chicken and 
sweetbreads. 

Bordelaise Sauce. 

Sauce a, la Bordelaise. 

2 Shallots. 1-2 Glass Claret. 

3-4 Pint of Sauce Espagnole. 

A Dash of Red Pepper. 

Cut two shallots very fine; put in a 
saucepan with a half glassful of Claret; 
reduce one-half; add three-quarters of a 
pint of good Sauce ^Bspagnole (see re- 
cipe) and a dash of red pepper. Cook 
for 'twenty minutes and serve hot. In 
serving' this sauce, the flavor may be In- 
creased by adding a dozen round slices 
of blanched Marrons. 

Bordelaise Sauce, Creole Style. 

Bordelaise Sauce a la Creole. 

1 Onion or 2 Shallots. 
1 Tablespoonful of Olive Oil. 
Salt and Pepper to Taste. 
Peel the onion or shallots and chop 
fine. Put in a saucepan with one table- 
spoonful of olive oil; let the onion saute 
well, and pour the sauce over tenderloin 
filets or sirloin steaks when it is desired 
to serve these a la Bordelaise A table- 
spoonful of Red -wine may be added to 
the sauce. 

Brown Sauce 

Sauce I^spagnole. 

1 Pound of Neck or Brisket of Veal. 

Bones of Beef. 
1 Gallon of Water. 2 Tablespoonfuls of 

Lard. 
1-2 Can Mushrooms or 1-4 Can Truffles. 

2 Carrots. 2 Tablespoonfuls of Flour. 
2 Cloves Garlic. 1 Herb Bouquet. 

1 Wineglass of Sherry. 

Take a good quantity of bones, place in 
a gallon of boiling water, and make a 
strong consomme, seasoning well with 
salt and pepper. Take a piece of the 
brisket or neck of the beef, and roast 
rare, so that the blood spurts out when 
pricked with a needle After roasting cut 
it in pieces of about one inch square. 
Take two tablespoonfuls of lard and 
three of flour, and brown slightly, stir- 
ring all the time. After browning, add 
the water of the consomme, which has 
been reduced to about half a gallon, 
pouring it in slowly and stirring con- 
stantly. Then add all the pieces of the 
roast beef which you have cut. Add 
three carrots, two cloves of garlic, one 
onion, an herb bouquet (tied together of 
thyme, parsley and bay leaf), and let the 
whole boil well two hours, stirring every 
five minutes until reduced to the consis- 
tency of starch. Then strain well through 
a strainer or sieve, season to taste, and 
set back on the stove to cook a few min- 
utes longer. Taste, and if sufficiently 
seasoned, take it off and allow it W get 
cool. This sauce is then used as a foun- 
dation sauce, and will keep for at least 
one month in our climate of New Or- 
leans, if put in a cool place in winter or 
the ice box In summer. 

The Brown Sauce, or Sauce Gspagnole 
is made by taking out of this foundation 
sauce one tablespoonful at a time, and 
then adding one wineglass or two table- 



spoonfuls of Sherry, to dissolve, and a 
half pint of broth. Set it to boll again, 
and add a half can of mushr6oms or 
truffles, as desired. It is used for all 
meats, fish or fowl served hot. 

If one does not desire to keep it, and 
It is a matter of economy to do so, It 
can be made by reducing the proportions 
for the dish to be prepared, simply 
browning one tablespoonful of butter and 
two of flour, adding at the right ffme a 
pint of boiling broth, and Sherry to taste. 

Bro^n Butter Sauce.

ripe and spoiled. Put them in a porce- 
lain-lined saucepan, with one pint of 
water, and let them boil over a moderate 
fire, stirring occasionally with a wooden 
spoon, and mashing the fruit as much as 
possible. Wihen the berries have cooked 
about twenty minutes, remove the sauce- 
pan from the fire, and add the sugar, 
stirring in sufficient to sweeten nicely.

minutes longer, after adding the sugar,

in an earthen mold. Liquid cranberry 
is a very poor apology for the dainty

CHAPTER XXn. 
8AI,ADS. 

Des Salades 



The Creoles have always been famous 
for the excellent salads which grace 
their tables. Salad, like soup, or gumbo, 
is the daily accompaniment of dinner in 
even the most humble Creole home. They 
hold, one and all, that a good salad is a 
most delightful dish, but a poor one is 
worse than none at all. 

The old Spanish proverb that "to make 
a perfect salad there should be a miser 
for vinegar, a spendthrift for oil, a wiss 
man for salt and a madcap to stir ail 
these ingredients, and mix them well to- 
gether," still holds as the unfailing Cre- 
ole rule in making a good salad. The 
reason is clear. For the dressing of the 
salad should be saturated with the oil. 
before the salt, pepper and vinegar are 
added. Results have proven, however, 
where the salad is dressed in the bowl, 
that there can never really be too much 
vinegar, for, from the specific gravity 
of vinegar, compared to the oil, what is 
useless will fall to the bottom of the 
bowl. By dissolving the salt in the vine 
gar, instead of the oil, too, it becomes 
more thoroughly distributed throughout 
the salad. But this will not hold where 
each makes his own salad dressing at ta- 
ble, as is common in Creole families. 

The simple French Dressing for salads 
Is always the best for daily use, and 
also for formal dinners. It is not only 
lighter, as compared to the Mayonnaise 
Dressing, and, therefore, far more ac- 
ceptable at dinners where the courses 
are many, but the Creoles hold, like the 
French, that it is the only dressing for 
salads that are not intended for lunch- 
eons or teas, such as chicken, shrimp or 
crab salads. A Mayonnaise Dressing for 
salad should never be used at the family 
dinner or formal dinings. 

Plain French DresBing for Salads. 

Assaisonment Frapcais. 

3 Tablespoonfuls of the Best Olive Oil. 
1 Tablespoonful of Vinegar, According to 

1-4 Teaspoonful of Salt. 
1-4 Teaspoonful of Black Pepper. 

First put the oil into a small bowl. 
Then add gradually the salt and pepper 
until all are thoroughly mixed Then add 
gradually the vinegar, stirring contin- 
ually for about a minute. It is now ready 
to pour over the salad, and remember 
that it must be mixed thoroughly. The 
proportion of vinegar varies according 
to the salad to be dressed. Lettuce salad 
requires but little; tomato salad, corn 
salad or Doucette require more. Serve 
this dressing with lettuce, tomato, onion, 
cucumber and other vegetables and green 
salads. 

French Dressing — No, Z. 

Assaisonment Francais. 

3 Tablespoonfuls of Oil. 

1 Tablespoonful of Tarragon Vinegar. 

A Saltspoon Sach of Black Pepper and 

Salt. 

Chopped Onion and Parsley. ' 

The juice of Half an Onion. 



Mix these in the order given above, 
adding the onion juice and parsley, well 
chopped, last. This is a more elaborate 
French dressing. Serve with the same 
salads as above. The oil may be omit- 
ted for those who do not like it, but it 
will be no longer in either of these re- 
cipes a French Dressing. The Creoles 
hold that the oil is a very healthy, di- 
gestible and essential ingredient. 

Mustard Dressing, 

Assaisonment -a la Moutarde. 

1 Tablespoonful of Vinegar. 

1 Teaspoonful of Prepared Mustard. 

2 Tablespoonfuls of Olive Oil. 
The Tolk of 1 Egg, if Desired. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 
Blend the mustard and the oil, adding 
the latter, drop by drop at first, and 
then proceeding more confidently. When- 
ever the dressing appears to be curdling, 
add a few drops of vinegar, and work 
rapidly till it becomes smooth again. Add 
the salt and pepper, and when the dress- 
ing is finished, use it for celery salad, 
fish, tomatoes, potatoes, etc. If the oil 
appears to separate from the other in- 
gredients, it can always be rubbed into 
them smoothly again by adding a few 
drops of vinegar. In all these salads the 
question of oil and its measurements can 
only be approximated. Good judgment 
must always be the final test. 

Creole French Dressing. 

Assaisonment a la Creole. 

3 Tablespoonfuls of the Best Olive Oil. 

1 Tablespoonful of Vinegar. 

1 Teaspoonful Mustard. 

The Tolk of a Hard-Boiled Egg. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

Blend the oil and salt and pepper in 
the manner above indicated, and then 
add these to the mustard, drop by drop, 
alternating with the vinegar. When well 
blended add the well-mashed yolk of a 
hard-boiled egg. Stir well, and serve with 
lettuce, celery or potato salad. 

Mayonnaise Dressing. 

Sauce Mayonnaise. 

Tolk of 1 Egg. 

Sweet Oil. Lemon. Vinegar. 

Pepper and Salt. 

Take the yolk of one fresh egg, raw 
and put it in a bowl. The egg and the 
oil must be cold, and in summer it is 
well to keep the soup plate in which you 
make the dressing on cracked ice In a 
pan, so that the oil will not run. Put 
the yolk in a plate; add, drop by drop, a 
little sweet oil from the bottle. WTien 
you have dropped about a spoonful, be- 
ing careful to work it into the yolk of 
the egg, drop by drop, and blend all the 
time, take a lemon and drop a few drops 
into the mixture. It will at once begin 
to harden as you stir it In. Continue 
stirring till the egg grows hard, and then 
steadily, drop by drop, let the oil fall, 
working it all the time with your forlt 
into the egg. Have another spoon, begin 
to drop in the lemon juice, working it the 
same way again till it hardens the egg. 



110 



Then be^n again with the oil and work 
ag:ain, and again drop the lemon till you 
have the juice of half a lemon and about 
two gills of oil, finishing with the oil. 
When the egg begins to curdle, add a 
little salt, but do not add this salt till 
the Mayonnaise is complete. Serve very 
cold, with salads, etc. 

Mayonnaise is the standing sauce for 
chicken salad, shrimp salad, crab salad, 
etc. When making for these large salads, 
as a garnish use three yolks of eggs and 
other ingredients in proportion. 

Bemonlade Dressinff. 

Sauce Remoulade.

A Remoulade is a cold sauce, and is 
always served with cold meats. Boil the 
eggs till hard. Remove the shells and set 
aside the whites, ■which you will have 
crumbled fine for a garnish. Put the 
yolks into a bowl, and mash very fine, 
till perfectly smooth. Add the mustard, 
and mix well, and the seasonings of 
vinegar and salt and Cayenne to taste. 
Then add the olive oil, drop by drop, 
working in the egg all the time, and then 
add the yolk of the raw egg, and work 
In thoroughly, till light. Then add the 
Juice of half a lemon. Mix well, in- 
creasing the quantity of oil or vinegar, 
according to taste, very slightly. If the 
sauce is not thoroughly mixed it will 
curdle. It is now ready to be served

and pick over carefully, and select the 
fresh, crisp leaves. Place all these in a 
salad bowl, and garnish nicelv with sliced 
hard-boiled egg. Never dress the lettuce 
before bringing to the table. The vinegar 
causes the leaves to wilt utterly, and 
takes away all the relish which one ex-

112 



dish, and also spoils a fine table garnish. 
Bring to the table, and let the sauce, al- 
ways a plain French Dressing or Creole 
Dressing preferred, be made at the table. 
Generally each makes the dressing to 
suit himself or herself, using proportions 
of greater or lesser quantity than those 
mentioned in the recipe. If one person 
dresses the salad for the table, use the 
proportions given above in any of the 
French salad dressings for this amount 
of lettuce. This is one of the nicest and 
most refreshing as -well as one of the 
healthiest of all salads.

Tomato, Green Pepper and Onion Salad. 

Salade a la Creole. 

4 Tomatoes. 2 Green Peppers. 1 Large 

Onion. 

French Dressing (plain). 

Slice the tomatoes, onions and green 
peppers nicely and thin; arrange on a 
dish, placing a layer of tomatoes, an al- 
ternate layer of onion and green pepper, 
and tomatoes mixed. Dress either before 
bringing to the table, or at the table, 
with French Dressing. This is a great 
family salad among the Creoles, and a 
very healthy one. The Creoles follow 
the old adage, that the taste of the onion 
must only lurk within the bowl when 
using it for salad. More than this ren 
ders the salad disagreeable and coarse. 

Watercress Salad. 

Salade de Cresson. 

1 Pint of Watercress. 
Minced Potato, if desired. 
A Plain French Dressing. 

This salad is made of watercress 
simply, or watercress and minced pota- 
toes, mixed In equal quantities, and 
served with a French Dressing. It is a 
most healthy, light and excellent salad, 
especially in summer. The salad Is de- 
lightful without the potatoes. They may 
be added if desired. 

The Gardener's Wife Salad. 
Salade a la Jardiniere. 

1 Carrot. 3 Beets. 

1-2 Cup of Green Peas. 1 Cup String 

Beans. 

A Plain French Dressing. 

Take fine strips of vegetables of dif- 
ferent colors, cooked and cold, with green 
peas and string beans, and dress nicely 
with oil and vinegar and serve. 

Sardine Salad. 

Salade de Sardines. 

1 Box of Sardines. 
A Plain French Dressing. 

Cut the sardines into pieces of about 
half an inch in length. Season nicely 
with a French Dressing and serve. This 
is a delicious luncheon dish. 

Potato Salad. 

Salade de Pommes de Terre. 

3 Large Cold Boiled Potatoes. 

2 Hard-Boiled Eggs. 

6 Tablespoonfuls of Olive Oil. 

3 Tablespoonfuls of Vinegar. 1 Large 

Onion. 

1 Teaspoonful of Salt. 

4 Sprigs of Parsley. 

This is a nice way of utilizing cold left- 
over potatoes. But the freshly-boiled po- 
tatoes always make the nicest "salad: 
Pare and peel the potatoes. If freshly 
boiled, and let them cool. Prepare the 
salad dressing, following impliclty the 
directions given for plain French Dress- 
ing, only here the quantities are larger in 
proportion. Add the vinegar, stirring 
constantly. A dash of mustard may be 
added, if desired. Mince the onion very 
fine, and cut the potatoes Into difte or 
slices, and mix them carefully with the 
onion. Then add the dressing, turning the 

gotatoes into It without breaking, 
prlnkle all with parsley, nicely chopped, 
and serve cold.

1 Teaspoontul of MustafS. 

This salad is made of cooked carrots, 
parsnips, beets, cold roast beef, cold ham, 
a truffle (if it can be afforded), all cut 
into fancy or dice-shaped pieces. Use 
one ounce of each of the meats, or simply 
one cup of cold minced fowl, as it may 
not be convenient to have all these meats 
at hand in households. Add six boned 
anchovies, and one dozen olives and two 
caviares, and serve with Tartare Sauce, 
or with a French Salad Dressing, to 



which mustard has been added. It is n, 
heavy salad. 

Shrimp Salad. 

Salade de Chevrette a la Mayonnaise. 

2 Pints of Cold Boiled Shrimp.

larger Lake Shrimp into two. Season 
well with* salt and pepper. Chop some 
lettuce. Season well. Place first a layer 
of shrimp and then of lettuce, and spread 
over all a Mayonnaise Sauce. Garnish 
nicely with sliced hard-boiled eggs, sliced 
beets and celery and lettuce tips, and 
serve very cold. 



CHAPTER XXIII. 
SGGS. 

Des Oeufs. 



A chapter on eggs would be super- 
fluous in any cook book, were it not for 
the fact that there are many, many 
women who cannot tell for a certainty 
just how long to boil an egg soft or 
hard, just when the exact point is reached 
when the omelette is cooked to a nicety, 
and how to send to the table in all the 
perfection of good cooking that most 
delicate and palatable dish, the "Scram- 
ble'a Egg." 

The Creoles have very wisely eschewed 
all innovations in cooking eggs that re- 
quire more than- five to eight minutes to 
cook to perfection. They cling to the old 
fashioned soft-boiled egg, the hard-boiled 
egg, fried egg, scrambled and poached 
eggs. They- have retained many ancient 
French and Spanish methods of cooking 
eggs, but none of these, followed prop- 
erly, according to the time-honored cus- 
toms, calls for more than five or eight 
minutes at the most in cooking. 

The first and most important point to 
be considered in preparing eggs for the 
table is to ascertain whether they are 
perfectly fresh. The fresher the egg the 
better. The egg which appears moldy or 
in the least bit ancient should be rejected. 
Never, under any circumstances, put a 
tainted egg in any dish, under the im- 
pression that other ingredients will hide 
the flavor. Never put such an egg in a 
cake. The presence of one egg that is 
not fresh will ruin an entire dish. As a, 
matter of health, above all other consid- 
erations, such eggs should be rejected. 

The old Creole dairkies, in common with 
many other people, have a way of find- 
ing out whether an egg is fresh by in- 
closing it in the hollow of the hand and 
looking through it with one eye, while 
shutting the other. They aver that if 
you can distinctly trace the yolk in one 
solid mass, and if the white around it 
looks clear, the egg is good. A more 
simple and scientific way, and by far a 
surer one, is to drop the eggs into cold 
water. The fresh ones will sink imme- 
diately to the bottom, the doubtful ones 
will swim around a little before reach- 
ing the bottom, and the bad ones will 
float. 

Eggs are among the most nutritious 
articles of food substances. They are 
rich in albumen, and their free use can- 
not be too highly recommended to the 
delicate, to hard brain workers, and to 
families generally. 



Boiled Eggs. 

Oeufs a la Coque. 

Have ready a saucepan of boiling wa- 
ter. Use only fresh eggs. Put them in 
the boiling water without cracking the 
shells. If you desire soft-boiled eggs, or 
"Oeufs Mollets," let the eggs boil from 
two minutes to two minutes and a half 
by the clock, keeping the ' exact time, 
minute by minute. The whites will then 
be set. If you desire the yolk to be set 
also in the soft-boiled egg, let the eggs 
boil three minutes, but not a second 
longer. For hard-boiled eggs, five min- 
utes is sufficient. Bear in mind always 
that the water must be boiling hard be- 
fore you put eggs into it, and that the 
exact time for boiling must be followed 
by the clock or with the watch in hand. 

Poached Eggs. 

Oeufs Poches. 

Have the frying pan filled with boiling 
water. Add salt. Some add also a ta- 
blespoonful of vinegar ' 
ter of taste. The eggs must be absolutely 
fresh. Break the eggs into a saucer, one 
by one, and gently slip off into the wa- 
ter, without breaking the yolk. Break 
another and another, until you have four 
in the pan, and allow the eggs to stand 
apart. Let them boil thus on the water, 
till the white forms a thin veil over the 
yolks. Then the eggs are done. Take 
them up gently, neatly round off the 
ragged edges, sprinkle the top with a 
little black pepper, place on buttered 
toast, and serve immediately. 

Fried Eggs. 

Oeufs Frits. 

6 Eggs. 2 Tablespoonfuls of Lard. 

The lard must be very hot. Break the 
eggs gently into a saucer, one by one, 
and drop gently into the lard, without 
breaking the yolks. With the spoon take 
up a little of the hot lard and drop 
gently over the top of the egg, if you 
wish it to be quite done. Otherwise 
simply fry till the yojk is set. Slide out 
on a batter cake turner, and place in a 
dish. Sprinkle with salt and black pep- 
per, and add, if you wish, a little pars- 
ley garnish, and serve very hot. 



114 



Ham and Vlgg». 

Oeufs au Jambon. 

6 Slices of Ham. 6 Eggs. 
1 Tablespoonful of Lard. 

The ham should always be soaked in 
hot water before frying. Cut slices of 
about half an inch in thickness, of suffi- 
cient size to lay an egg upon them. Lay 
the ham in the hat frying pan, and let it 
fry until the fat becomes transparent. 
Then take the slices out and* put them 
on a hot dish. Break the eggs, one by 
one, into a saucer, and slip them into the 
frying pan, and fry in the same lard in 
which you have fried the ham. When 
the yolks are quite set, take them out, 
and lay one egg on each slice of ham. 
Garnish nicely with parsley, and serve 
hot. This is a great Creole breakfast 
dish. 

Scrambled Eggs. 

Oeufs Erouilles. 

6 Fresh Eggs. A Tablespoonful of Butter. 
Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

Break the eggs into a saucer, one by 
one, and then transfer to a bowl. Season 
well with salt and pepper. Have the 
frying pan very hot. Put into it the 
butter, and add immediately the eggs, 
and keep stirring around and around 
and across for about three or four min- 
utes, judging by the consistency of the 
e&g. which must be like a thick mush as 
you take it from the fire. Keep stirring 
a few seconds longer after you have 
taken the pan off the fire, and put the 
eggs into a hot dish, and garnish witn 
parsley and serve immediately with but- 
tered toast or broiled ham. The beauty 
of the scrambled egg is that the whites 
and yolks are delicately blended. The 
practice of beating the yolks and whites 
thoroughly together, as for an omelette, 
before scrambling the eggs, is to be con- 
demned as against the best ethics of Cre- 
ole cookery. There is no comparison in 
the taste of the scrambled egg cooked ac- 
cording to the above method and the 
eggs in which the yolks and whites have 
been previously beaten together. 

"Eggs Scrambled In Ham. 

Oeufs Brouilles au Jambon. 

6 Eggs. 

3 Tablespoonfuls of Finely Minced 

Boiled Ham. 

A Tablespoonful of Butter. 

Mince the ham very fine, and break 
the eggs, one by one, into a saucer, and 
add to the bowl in which you have 
minced the ham. Mix all together. Place 
a tablespoonful of butter in the frying 
pan, add the eggs and ham, stir briskly, 
and when it comes to the consistency of 
starch take off the fire, and serve hot on 
buttered toast. 

In the same manner eggs may be 
scrambled with minced truffles, mush- 
rooms, onions, celery or tomatoes. 

Eggs Scrambled With Preserves. 

Oeufs Brouilles aux Confitures. 

6 Eggs. 1 Tablespoonful of Butter. 
2 Tablespoonfuls of Fruit Marmalade. 

Eggs may also be scrambled with mar 
malade of apricots or prunes, in which 
case they are called "Oeufs Brouilles aux 
Confitures." Follow above recipe, using 
the marmalade Instead of the hatn. 



Eggs Fondas. 

Oeufs Fondus au Fromage. 

6 Eggs. 

4 Heaping Teaspoonfuls of Gruyere 

Cheese, Grated. 

1 Tablespoonful of Butter. 

Break the eggs into a saucepan, add 
the butter^ the grated cheese, a little salt 
and pepper. Place the saucepan on a 
hot fire, stir the mixture around and 
around till the edges begin to thicken, 
and when of the consistency of a thick 
starch take off the fire and serve imme- 
diately on buttered toast. 

Eggs With Asparagus Tips. 

Oeufs aux Pointes d'Asperges. 

6 Eggs. 

2 Tablespoonfuls of Asparagus Tips. 

1 Tablespoonful of Butter.

recipe. Serve on buttered toast. 

Cauliflower may be prepared with eggs 
in the same way. 

Shirred Eggs. 

Oeufs sur le Plat. 

6 Eggs. 1 Tablespoonful of Butter. 
Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

Break the eggs into a thin dish, in 
which they are to be served, having first 
buttered the bottom of the dish or pan. 
Sprinkle them w^ith salt and pepper, pour 
over a little melted butter, place in a 
quick oven, and let them bake until the 
yolks are set. Serve in the dish in which 
they have been cooked. 

Eggs a la Ponlette. 

Oeufs a. la Poulette. 
6 Eggs. 1-2 Pint of Sauce a la Poulette. 

Boil the eggs hard and slice. Pour 
over a Sauce a la Poulette (see recipe), 
and serve hot. 

Beauregard Eggs. 

Oeufs a la Beauregard. 

6 Eggs. 1-2 Pint of Fresh Milk. 

1 Tablespoonful of Butter. 
1 Tablespoonful o'f Cornstarch. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

Boil the eggs for five minutes, till 
hard. Then take out of the water and 
cool, take off the shells, and separate the 
whites from the yolks, rubbing the lat- 
ter through a sieve, and chopping the 
former very fine. But do not mix them. 
Have the milk ready to boil, and rub 
the butter and cornstarch together, and 
add to the boiling milk. Then add the 
whites of the eggs, and salt and pepper 
to taste. Prepare previous to this some 
buttered toast, and cover It now with a 
layer of this white sauce, and then add 
a layer of the yolks of the eggs. Add 
another layer of the sauce, and another 
layer of the yolks, and then the remain- 
der of the sauce. St)rinkle the top with 
a little salt and pepper, and set in the 
oven and let it stand two minutes, and 
serve hot.

Plain Omelet. 

Omelette. 

4 Fresh Bggs. 1 Tablespoonful of 

Butter. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

II you wish to have the omelet very 
nice, break the whites and yolks sep- 
arately, and beat the former till they 
come to a light froth, and the latter 
till they are quite lig-ht. Then beat the 
whites and yolks together. Season well. 
Melt the butter in a frying pan, letting 
it grow hot, but not by any means 
brown. Pour in the mixture of egg. Let 
it stand about two minutes, shaking oc- 
casionally to prevent it from sticking to 
the pan. Continue shaking over a quick 
fire until the eggs are set. Then roll 
the omelet, folding it in two or three 
rolls and' making it long and narrow. 
Take a hot dish, turn the omelet into it, 
garnish with parsley, and serve hot im- 
mediately, or it will fall. It Is always 
easier to make several small omelets 
and have them pretty and sightly than 
to succeed perfectly in making a large 
one.

CHAPTER XXrV. 

LOUISIANA bice:. 

Le Hiz de la Louisia-ne. 



The cultivation of rice began In Lou- 
isiana nearly a hundred years after It 
comnienced in Georgia and South Caro- 
lina, but Louisiana now produces more 
of this beautiful grain than both these 
states combined. It is one of the great 
Louisiana staples, and New Orleans is 
the distributing point of the immense 
crop that yearly makes our immense rice 
fields of iSouthwestern 'Louisiana the 
wonder and admiration of tourists. 

In no section of the world can rice 
be grown at so small a cost as in Lou- 
isiana. The cost of growing the grain 
in our matchless clime is small, and it 
requires but little capital to begin. 

The following recipes, carefully select- 
ed from among many that are used in 
this old Creole city of New Orleans, will 
give an idea of how rice is prepared and 
made such a delightful article of food In 
our Creole households: 

How to Prepare Bice for Cooking. 

The whiteness of the rice depends in a 
great degree upon its being washed thor- 
oughly. Pick the rice clean, and wash it 
well in cold water before attempting to 
cook, rubbing the rice well with the 
hands to get all the dust off. Pour off 
the first water, and add fresh; then pour 
off this, and add fresh again. The rice 
will then be ready to cook. 

How to BoU Bice. 

Wlien properly boiled, rice should be 
snowy white, perfectly dry and srnooth; 
and every grain separate and distinct. 
To attain this end, put a quart of water 
on the fire, and let it boil well, with a 
teaspoonful of salt. Wash a cup of rice 
well in cold water. When the water 
commences to boil well add the rice. 
The boiling water will toss the grains 
of rice, and prevent them from clinging 
together. As soon as the grains com- 
mence to soften do not, under any cir- 
cumstances, stir or touch the rice again. 
Let it continue to boil rapidly for about 
twenty minutes, or until the grains be- 
gin to swell out, and it appears to 
thicken. This is easily ascertained by 
touching one of the grains with your 
finger. When it has reached this stage 
take the cover off and pour off the 
water, and set the pot in the oven, so 
that the rice may swell up. Let it stand 
in the oven about ten minutes. Do not 
let it brown, but simply dry — that is, let 
the water which rises dry out of the 
rice. Take it off, and let it stand a few 
minutes. Then pour out into a dish. 
Every grain will be white and beautiful, 
and stand apart because the drying in 
the oven will have evaporated the mois- 
ture, leaving the rice soft, snowy white 
and perfectly dry. 

Boiled rice is delicious served with 
chicken, turkey, crab or shrimp or okra 
gumbo, as also with many vegetables, all 
daubes, and with gravies of all kinds. It 
is the standing dish of every Creole table. 

Creole Jambalaya. 

Jambalaya a la Creole. 

Jambalaya is a Spanish-Creole dish, 
which is a great favorite in New Or- 
leans, and is made according to the fol- 
lowing recipe. 



One and a Half Cups of Rice 

1 Pound of Fresh Pork. 1 Slice of Ham. 

1 Dozen Pine Chaurice (Pork 

Sausage). 

2 Onions. 1 Tablespoonful of Butter. 

2 Cloves of Garlic. 
2 Sprigs Each of Thyme and Parsley. 

2 Bay Leaves. 2 Cloves Ground Very 

Fine. 

3 Quarts of Beef Broth or Hot Water. 

(Broth Preferred.) 
1-2 Spoonful of Chili Pepper. 
Salt, Pepper and Cayenne to Taste. 
Cut the pork very fine, lean and fat, 
into pieces of about half an inch square. 
Chop the onions very fine, and mince 
the garlic and fine herbs. Grind the 
cloves. Put a tablespoonful of butter 
into the saucepan, and add the onions 
and pork, and let them brown slowly. 
Stir frequently, and let them continue 
browning slightly. When slightly brown 
add the ham, chopped very fine, and 
the cloves of garlic. Then add the 
minced herbs, thyme, bay leaf and pars- 
ley and cloves. Let all this brown for 
five minutes longer, and add a dozen 
fine Chaurice, cut apart, and let all cook 
five minutes longer. Then add the three 
quarts of water or broth, always using 
In preference the broth. Let it all cook 
for ten minutes, and when it comes to 
a boil add the rice, which has been care- 
fully washed. Then add to this a half 
teaspoonful of Chili pepper, and salt and 
Cayenne to taste. The Creoles season 
highly with Cayenne. Let all boil for 
a half hour longer, or until the rice is 
firm, and serve hot. 

Crab Jambalaya. 

Jambalaya aux Crabes. 
1 Dozen Fine, Large Crabs. 
1 1-2 Cups of Rice. 3 Quarts of Broth. 
3 Tomatoes. 2 Onions.

Jambalaya au Congri 

1 Cup of Rice. 

1 Pint of Cowpeas. 

1 Large Onion. 

1-2 Pound of Salt Meat. 1 Square Inch 

of Ham.

into dice, and mince the ham. Boil the 
cowpeas and the salt meat and ham 
together. Add the onion, minced very 
fine. Boil the rice according to recipe 
for boiled rice. (See recipe.) Chop the 
meat well. After the peas and the rice 
are cooked, pour the rice into the pot 
of peas, which must not be drv. but very 
moist. Mix well. Let all simmer for 
five minutes, and then serve hot. On 
Fridays and fast days the Creoles boll 
the peas in water, adding a tablespoon- 
ful of butter, but no meat. It is again 



117 



buttered according to individual taste at 
table. The jambalaya, however, is much 
nicer when made with the meat.

stir well. Then add chopped thyme, bay 
leaf and parsley, and two cloves of gar- 
lic, minced very fine. Let all of this fry 
five minutes longer, and be careful not 
to let it burn or brown too much. Add 
a half teaspoonful of Chili pepper, and 
three large tomatoes, chopped fine, and 
also add the juice. Let all brown or 
simmer for ten minutes longer. When

(the former preferred) which has been 
heated to the boiling point. Let all boil 
well, and then add the lake shrimp, 
which you will already have boiled ac- 
cording to recipe. (See recipe for Boiled 
Shrimp.) Let the mixture boil again for 
five minutes, and add one cup and a half 
of rice, or half a pound, which has been 
well washed. Mix all well, and let boil 
for half or three-quarters of an hour 
longer, stirring every once in a while, 
so as to mix all together. Serve hot.

GALAS. 
"Belle Cala! Tout Chaud!" 

Under this cry was sold by the ancient 
Creole negro women in the French Quar- 
ter of New Orleans a delicious rice cake, 
which was eaten with the morning cup 
of Cafe au Lait. The Cala woman was 
a daily figure in the streets till within 
the last two or three years. She went 
her rounds in quaint bandana tignon, 
guinea blue dress and white apron, and 
carried on her head a covered bo-wl, in 
which were the dainty and hot Galas. 
Her cry, "Belle Cala! Tout Chaud'" 
would penetrate the morning air, and the 
olden Creole cooks would rush to the 
doors to get the first fresh, hot Calas 
to carry to their masters and mistresses 
with the early morning cup of coffee. 
The Cala women have almost all passed 
away. 

But the custom of making Calas still 
remains. In many an ancient home the 
good housewife tells her daughters just 
how "Tante Zizi" made the Calas in her 
day, and so are preserved these ancient 
traditional recipes. 

From one of the last of the olden Cala 
women, one who has walked the streets 
of the French Quarter for fifty years and 
more, we have the following established 
Creole recipe: 

1-2 Cup of Rice. 3 Cups Water (boiling). 
3 Eggs. 1-2 Cup of Sugar. 
1-2 Cake of Compressed Teast. 

1-2 Teaspoonful ot Grated Nutmeg. 
Powdered White Sugar. Boiling Lard. 

Put three cups of water in a saucepan 
and let it boil hard. Wash half a cup of 
rice thoroughly, and drain and put In 
the boiling water. Let it boil till very 
soft and mushy. Take it out and set it 
to cool. When cold, mash well and mix 
with the yeast, which you will have dis- 
solved in a half cup of hot water. Set 
the rice to rise overnight. In the morn- 
ing beat three eggs thoroughly, and add 
to the rice, mixing and beating well. 
Add a half cup of sugar and three table- 
spoonfuls of flour, to make the rice ad- 
here. Mix "well and beat thoroughly, 
bringing it to a thick batter. Set to rise 
for fifteen minutes longer. Then add 
about a half teaspoonful of grated nut- 
meg, and mix well. Have ready a frying 
pan. In which there is sufficient quan- 
tity of lard boiling tor the rice cakes to 
swim in It, Test by dropping In a small 
piece of bread. If It becomes a golden 
brown the lard Is ready, but If It bums 
or browns Instantly It Is too hot. The 
golden brown color Is the true test. Take 
a large deep spoon, and drop a spoonful 
at a time of the preparation Into the 
boiling lard, remembering always that 
the cake must not touch the bottom of 



the pan. Let fry to a nice brown. , The 
old Cala women used to take the Calaii 
piping hot, wrap them in a clean towel, 
basket or bowl, and rush through the 
streets with the welcome cry, "Belle Cala! 
Tout Chaud!" ringing on the momine 
air. But in families the cook simply 
takes the Calas out of the frying pan 
and drains off the lard by laying in a 
colander or on heated pieces of brown 
paper. They are then placed in a hot 
dish, and sprinkled over with powdered 
white sugar, and eaten hot with Cafe au 
Lait. 

Bice Waffles. 

Galettes de Riz. 

1 1-2 Cups of Softly Boiled Rice. 

2 Ounces of Butter. 1 Pint of Scalded 

Milk. 

3 Eggs. 1 Teaspoonful of Baking 

Powder. 

1-2 Teaspoonful of Salt. 

1 Tablespoonful of Wheat Flour. 

The rice must be cold and well mashed. 
Melt the two tablespoonfuls of butter 
into the milk, which has been allowed 
to cool. Beat the yolks of the eggs and 
the whites separately, making the latter 
come to a stiff froth. Mix the rice and 
milk. Beat thoroughly, and then add a 
half teaspoonful of salt and one of bak- 
ing powder, and the flour. Put the yolks 
into the batter, first blending well, and 
lastly add the whites, and beat well 
again. The waffle iron should be very 
hot, and -well greased in every part. 
Always have a little brush with which 
to grease the waffle irons. Pour the bat- 
ter into a pitcher, so that you may more 
easily fill the irons. Open Uie irons, pour 
the batter from the pitcher and fill the 
iron quickly. Then close quickly and set 
on the fire. As soon as the edges are 
set, turn the iron and l>ake on the other 
side. Two minutes ^ould be all the time 
required to bake a waffle nicely. The 
■waffles must be baked evenly. Always 
select the simple waffle baker with four 
compartments in preference to the more 
elaborate designs. Better results will be 
achieved. When the waffles are baked, 
remove them carefully, place on a hot 
dish, piling them in double rows, and but- 
ter them generously. Rice waffles are 
generally served with ground cinnamon 
and sugar mixed and sprinkled over. But 
this is a matter of taste. They are very 
delicious when served -with butter and 
Louisiana Syrup or Molasses.

If you wish" to have a baked custard, 
place the custard in a pan or in cups. 
Set in the oven to brown, and serve hot, 
with a Cream Sauce. The above amount 
will fill about eight cups. 

Bice Dumplings. 
Echaudes de Riz. 

It was the old Creole negro cooks who 
first evolved that famous Creole dessert, 
Rice Dumplings. They are made as fol- 
lows: 

1-2 Cup of Flour. 3 Cups of Ground Rice. 
8 Apples, Tart and Not Overripe. 

2 Quarts of Milk. Sugar and Cinnamon. 

1-4 of the Peel of an Orange. 
1-2 of a Grated Nutmeg. 
Pare the apples and take out the cores, 
leaving the apples whole. Take the 
ground cinnamon and sugar, and mix 
well, and fill the cores with this mixture. 
In the meantime boil the rice in milk till 
it comes to the consistency of flour, 
having added the grated peel of an 
orange and a half teaspoonful of grated 
nutmeg and a half cup of flour. Take 
off the fire, and let it cool. Then coyer 
each apple all over with a very thick 
coating of the rice, and tie each dumpling 
in a cloth very tightly, and put them in 
a pot of cold water. Bring the water to 
a quick boil, and boil the apples for 
three-quarters of an hour. When done, 
untie the cloth and place the dumplings 
carefully on a large dish. Sprinkle each 
with a little grated nutmeg, put on top 
of each a dot of butter, set in the oven 
for five or ten minutes to brown, and 
serve with a Hard or Cream Sauce. 
They are most delicious with a Hard 



120 



Sauce. They may be served without set- 
ting in the oven, immediately after they 
have been taken from the water, or they 
may be served cold. 

Ag'ain, in large families, the apples 
may be cut in halves or quarters, and 
boiled in the same manner, covering with 
the coating of rice, as in the folio-wing 
recipe: 

Apples and Bice. 

Riz a, la Conde. 

Take three large, fine apples, and cut 
in halves. Pare and core. Then bake 
in the oven until quite done and juicy. 
Make a Rice Pudding (see recipe), using 
only one cup of rice and other ingre- 
dients in proportion. When the apples 
are cold, set in a dish, placing each apple 
over a small bed of Rice Pudding. Plan 
the same quantity on top of the apple, 
so that it will be inclosed between the 
rice as in a ball. Serve in saucers, and 
pour over each riced apple two table- 
spoonfuls of Brandy or Cream Sauce.

Bice With Compote k)f Oranges, 

Riz a la CO'inpote d'Orangres. 

3-4 Cup of Rice. 11-2 Pints Millc. 1 

Quart Cream. 

1 1-2 Cups Sugar. 

Yollcs of 8 Eggs. 1 Tablespoonful of 

"Vanilla. 

Tlie Grated Peel of an Orange. 

12 Sweet Louisiana Oranges. 1 Pound 

Sugar. 
1 Gill Water. 1-4 of a Grated Nutmeg. 

Wash the rice clean, and boil accord- 
ing to recipe in about a pint and a quar- 
ter of water. In half an hour take off 
and drain of all water, and press through 
a sieve. Then add it to the milk, and let 
it boil slowly a half hour longer without 
burning. Whip the cream to a stiff 
froth, and add the drain to the rice or 
milk, and set the whipped cream to cool 
until it is needed. Beat the yolks of the 
eggs and the sugar until they are very 
light. Add them to the boiling rice, stir- 
ring constantly and well, and let it cook 
for two minutes, adding in the meantime 
the grated peel of the orange. Take the 
mixture from the fire. Then add the 
tablespoonful of vanilla, and the grated 
nutmeg. Mix well and set out to cool. 
Remove the dasher from the ice cream 
freezer, and when the mixture has be- 
come very cool, turn it into the freezer 
and let it set packed in rock salt and ice 
for three hours. 

In the meantime take a dozen sweet 
Louisiana oranges, and peel and cut 
them crosswise into halves. Take out 
the cores with the sharp point of a pen- 
knife, and set them in a dish ready for 
use. Put a round of sugar to boil with 
one gill of water, and after ten minutes 
add the juice of half a lemon. Put a 
few pieces at a time of the oranges 
Into this boiling liquid, and lay thesm lOut 
side by side in a flat dish. Pour over 
them the syrup that remains from the 
boiling, and set the dish in the ice box 
to cool. When ready to serve, wipe thor- 
oughly the outside of the can that con- 
tains the pudding, and all around the 
edges, so as to remote any traces of salt. 
Wet a towel in boiling water and stand 
the oan upon it. Open the can. Put a 
round dish on top, and then turn quickly 
upside down, and remove the can. If the 
pudding adheres, repeat the applications 
of the hot towel at the bottom and 
around. Place the oranges on top and 
all around the pudding, and pour over 
them the syrup, which has become cool, 
but not frozen. Serve immediately. This 
is one of the most delicious, as well as 
one of the most typical of our Louisiana 
methods of serving rice as a dessert. 
Left-Over Bice. 
Enough has been said and written in 
these recipes to give an idea c-f the pos- 
sibilities of Louisiana rice under proper 



methods of culinary preparation. It en- 
ters into many different combinations ia 
cooking, and among the poorer C'reo'les of 
large families it takes, in a great meas- 
ure, the place of bread. A meal of boiled 
rice, with Grillades a la Sauce, and Red 
Beans or White Beans, is very popular 
among the Creoles, especially those of 
limited means, all of these being good, 
nourishing, as well as economical, dishes, 
the rice not only saving the expenditure 
of money for bread, but making a most 
welcome and palatble substitute. Tha 
family that uses rice daily will note the 
economy that follOTvs in the purchase 
of bread. 

Left-over rice may be utilized in al- 
most any of the above dishes, but it la 
more generally used in the making of 
rice waffles or rice cakes for breakfast, 
Calas, etc. It is also fried or made into 
rice fritters, as follows: 

Fried Bice, 

Riz Frit. 

Take the left-over rice from the day 
before, and cut it into slices of proper 
thickness, and fry to a nice brown, turn- 
ing it carefully, to avoid breaking the 
slices. This makes an excellent break- 
fast dish, with Grillades a la Sauce. (Sea 
recipe.) 

Bice Fritters. 

Beignets de Riz. 
Take the left-over rice and mash very 
fine. If you have only a cupful, take 
three eggs, a halt cup of flour, one tea- 
spoonful of yeast pcwder, and sugar to 
taste, and beat all into a light, thick bat- 
ter. Cook by dropping a spoonful at a 
time into boiling lard. This is a sweet 
entremet, as also an excellent breakfast 
dish. 

Parched Bice. 

Riz Grille. 
Rice may be parched in the same man- 
ner as popcorn. It is a method of cook- 
ing rice that came to New Orleans from 
the West Indies, and was brought into 
general use by the San Domingo refu- 
gees, who came to New Orleans in num- 
bers after the great insurrection. When 
the culture of rice became general in th4 
Southwestern parishes of our State, these 
old settlers began to give rice-parching 
parties, and they became very fashiona- 
ble. The Creole children and the belles 
and beaux of eighty years ago enjoyed 
parching rice just as much as Northern 
children, youths and maidens enjoy 
roasting chestnuts or parching corn. Rice 
is parched in the same manner as the 
Creoles parch popcorn. The parched 
grain of rice becomes a beautiful open 
ball, which is eaten with salt or sugar, 
and is very delicious. 



CHAPTER XXV. 



CEBEALS. 



Under the heading of Cereals are 
classed Wheat, Bye, Barley. Oats, Corn, 
Maize or Indian Corn, Buckwheat ano 
Rice. Rice being one of our great Lou- 
isiana staples, and the proper methods of 
preparing it so little known, has been sep- 
arately treated in the preceding chapter. 
The other Cereals are in general use in 
every section of our country, and will 
require less amplification. 



WHEAT. 

Du Froment. 

On account of its universal consump- 
tion and great nutritive qualities, Wheat 
is considered the principal cereal. In the 
form of bread. It has long been distin- 
guished as the "Staff of Life." 

The structure of the grain, like that 
of other cereals, consists of a gritty. 



122 



woody center covering, which is indiges- 
tible, and which is gotten rid of, after 
the grain has been ground, by "sifting."' 
In the w^hole wheat grain is found a 
perfect food, for it contains all that is 
necessary to support life — starch, gluten 
sugar, nitrogenous and carbonaceous 
matter, water, salts, potash, soda, lime, 
phosphoric acid, magnesia, etc. 

In what is called "whole meal," the 
bran and pollards derived from the oute»' 
covering are retained. From this wheat 
is made "Brown Bread," and though this 
kind of bread contains far more nitro- 
genous matter than white bread, it is not 
in general use, on account of its ind'- 
gestibility. It should never be eaten by 
persc-ns of weak digestion. 

Wheat contains a gluten, which is a 
gray, elastic, tough substance. This glu- 
ten is especially abundant in wheat 
grown in warm climates. From this 
gluten paste Macaroni and Vermicelli are 
made. 

Cracked Wheat. 

Froment Creve. 

1 CuT> of Cracked Wheat. 

1 Quart of Water. 

1 1 easpoonful of Salt. 

Under the name of "Cracked Wheat" 
there is sold in the markets whole wheat 
grains, which are cooked by boiling in a 
double boiler until the entire envelope of 
the grain bursts open. It will require 
four h'ours of good boiling, therefore, it 
is best to soak the grain over night i*i 
a quart of cold water. In the morning 
set the kettle containing the grain In 
another kettle of cold w^ater, add the salt, 
and let it gradually heat and boil for at 
least an hour and a half. It should be 
thoroughly cooked. Serve with sugar and 
cream for breakfast. 

FARINA. 

Fecule. 

1-2 Cup of Farina. 

1 Quart of Water or Milk. 

1 Teaspoonful of Salt. 

Add the salt to the milk or water, and 
then sift in slowly sufficient Farina to 
make a thick gruel. Set in a double 
boiler, and let it cook for about a half 
hour, stirring frequently while it boils. 

Farina Groel. 

Gruau de Fecule. 

1 Cup o^ Boiling Water. 

1 Cup of Fresh Milk. 

1 Large Tablespoonful of Farina. 

2 Tablesipoonfuls of White Sugar. 

In preparing this splendid food for in- 
fants, take a cup of boiling water, one 
cup of milk, and a pinch of salt. Slightly 
salt the water. Set one boiler within 
another, the latter boiler being filled 
with boiling water. iStir the Farina into 
the cup of boiling water, and let it boil, 
stirring constantly, till it thickens. Then 
add the milk, stirring it gradually, and 
let It boll about fifteen minutes longer. 
Sweeten, and when it is cool give to the 
child. Enough may be made to last all 
day. W^arm, when it is needed, with a 
little boiling milk. 

RYF. 

Selgle. 

Rye meal, once such a common article 
of food in New Orleans, is still extensive- 
ly used by the German population, both 
In making Rye Bread and in making Rye 
Mush. As regards nutritive quality. Rye 
ranks slightly less than flour. 



Bye Mush. 

Bouille de Seigle. 

3-4 Cup of Rye Meal. 
1 Quart of Boiling Water. 

Sift the meal Into the boiling water, 
and stir constantly while doing so. Add 
the salt, and continue stirring till the 
mixture begins to boil. Then cover and 
let it cook slowly for at least an hour 
and a quarter. Serve hot for breakfast, 
with sugar and cream. 

OATS. 

Avoine. 

From Oats, which are used so exten- 
sively as food for beasts, is produced 
Oatmeal, which heads the list of flesh- 
producing and strengthening grains, be 
ing far richer than flour in nitrogen and 
fat, and, therefore, more nutritious. Witli 
oatmeal porridge for breakfast, oatmeal 
cakes for dinner, milk, potatoes and a 
few vegetables, the hard-working labor- 
er or brain worker need require little 
else for sustenance from year's end to 
year's end. 

Oatmeal. 

Gruau d' Avoine. 

1 Cup of Oatmeal. 

1 Quart of Boiling Water. 

1 Teaspoonful of Salt. 

It is best to soak the oatmeal, when the 
coarse Scotch Oats are used, over night. 
Then cook for a half hour in the morn- 
ing, boling constantly, and salt to taste 
If the oatmeal is not soaked, it will re- 
quire at least an hour to cook. It bums 
very easily, and, therefore, it is always 
best to set in a double boiler. Serve 
with cream. 

Steamed OatmeaL 

Gruau d' Avoine a la Vapeur. 

1 Teacupful of Oatmeal. 

1 Quart of Boiling Water. 

1 Teaspoonful of Salt. 

Add the oatmeal to the water, and then 
add the salt, and set the steaming vessel 
over a pot of cold water, and let it 
gradually heat, and then steam for an 
hour and a half. Keep closely covered. 
When done, serve with cream. 

Oat Flakes. 

Flocons d' Avoine. 

1 Teacupful of Oat Flakes. 

1 Quart of Boiling Water. 

1-2 Teaspoonful of Salt. 

This delicate preparation from oatmeal 
is prepared by putting the quart of wa- 
ter into a porcelain-lined saucepan, and 
letting it come to a boil. Add the salt, 
and when it is boiling stir in gradually 
the oat flakes. Keep stirring to prevent 
burning. Let the preparation boil for 
about fifteen cr twenty minutes, and 
serve with sugar and cream, or simply 
cream or milk. 

CORN. 

Du Mais. 

Under this heading are included Com 
proper and our own Indian Corn, or 
Maize. From these come such staple 
dishes as "Grits," "Big Hominy," "UttJe 
Hominy," "Lye Hominy" or "Samp." 

Corn contains far greater force-pro- 
ducing and fattening matter than 
Wheat. S'cientists declare that cornmeal 
contains six times as much oil as wheat. 
Corn Bread Is, therefore, an excellent 
winter diet, as also the delicate "Grits* 



123 



and "Big and Small Hominy." "Samp" 
or "Lye Hominy," is used throughout the 
summer, as it is less heating. Prepara- 
tions of Corn are among the cheapest. If 
not the very cheapest articles of food, and 
considering their high nutritive value, 
are especially recommended to the fam- 
ilies of the poor. But, whether rich or 
poor, there are few Creole families In 
New Orleans who sit to breakfast with- 
out a good dish of Grits or Hominy. 

GRITS. 

Du Gru. 

Under the heading of Corn might prop- 
erly be classed the white com grits, 
without which no breakfast In Louisiana 
is considered complete. Grits is no[ 
only used for breakfast, but may ap- 
pear on the table several times a day, 
the left-over grits from breakfast being 
utilized either in dainty cakes or entre- 
mets, or else warmed over and served 
with gravies. Grits is the ,^ound dried 
com. 'We have yellow grits, or grits 
from which the outer yellow covering of 
the corn has not been removed, and 
white grits, the latter considered the 
daintier preparation. From these comes 
the "Small Hominy," or corn ground to 
superfineness. Grits are always boiled. 
Left-over may be fried or warmed up 
again, or beaten with eggs and milk and 
baked. This is a most delicious dish. 

BoUed OritB. 

Du Gru Bouilli. 

2 Cups of Grits. 

2 Quarts of Water. 2 Teaspoonfuls of 

Salt. 

Wash the grits in fresh cold water, 
and throw off the refuse. Waan again 
and drain. Into two quarts of cold wa- 
ter put the grits. Add the salt, and stir 
frequently while they are coming to the 
boiling point. Then set back on the 
stove and let them cook slowly for about 
an hour. It must be of the consistency 
of a very thick starch, or drier, if pre- 
ferred. For invalids it may be cooked 
like a cornmeal mush. Serve hot, with 
any meat, with gravy, or serve with milk, 
as oatmeal, as a preliminary to break- 
fast, or, again, simply eat with butter. 
In any manner in which they are served 
they are always rellshable and palatable. 
If half imilk, instead of water, is added 
in cooking, the dish is all the more de- 
licious. 

-Baked Grita. 

Du Gru aux Oeufs. 

1 Cup of Grits. 

1-2 Quart of Water. 1-2 Quart of Milk. 

2 Eggs. Salt to Taste. 

Boil the grits in the water and milk, 
mixed. Season, and when quite dry, take 
off the stove and let it cool a little. Beat 
the whites and yolks separately, and 
when the grits is cool beat in the yolks, 
and blend thoroughly. Then add the 
whites, and beat till very light. Add a 
gill of cream. Set in an oven and baka 
to a beautiful brown, and serve hot. 
This Is an ideal Creole breakfast dish. 
Cold grits may be thus utilized. 

HOAUNir. 

Saccamlte. 

Hominy is called by the Creoles the 
older sister of Grits. It was the Indians 
abound Louisiana who first taught the 
use of hominy. They used to take all 
thie dried Indian corn and thrash It till 
alj the yellow, hardened outer germ or 



hull came off, the grain being left white. 
Then they would bring the large whit- 
ened grains into the city to sell. Hominy 
became a great industry, and was exten- 
sively manufactured and sold all over 
the South. It was the chief food of the 
Southern negroes. But it was also a 
standing dish on the most elegant tables. 
The little Creole children were reared on 
"La Saccamite." The hominy was boiled 
in water in the same proportions as grits, 
but, of course, allowed to cook much 
lon:ger, till the great white grains of com 
were very soft, and yielded easily to 
pressure. It is still cooked in the same 
way, and eaten with milk or with sugar, 
the latter being a favorite dish with the 
Creole children. It is also eaten with 
meat and gravy, or simply with salt and 
butter. Left-over hominy is utilized in 
making hominy griddle cakes. 

We have also "Lye Hominy," or Hom- 
iny soaked in Lye till the coarse outer 
germ comes off. This is the great sum- 
mer dish of the city and parishes. The 
hominy is made in the parishes, and 
shipped to New Orleans. It is also 
pounded and used for making "Lye Hom- 
iny Bread." 

BoUed Hominy. 

La Saccamlte Boulllie. 

1 Pint of Hominy. 
2 Quarts erf Water. Salt to Taste. 

Hominy should always be soaked over 
night in cold water. Wash the hominy, 
and put into two quarts of water to soak. 
In the morning turn both hominy and 
water into a saucepan, and let it boil 
slowly for three or four hours. Serve 
with sugar and cream. It may also ba 
eaten with butter and salt and pepper. 

Hominy Croquettes. 

La Saccamite en Croquettes. 

These are made from the left-over 

hominy. They are prepared in exactly 

the same manner as rice croquettes. 

(See recipe.) Grits may be made into 

croquettes in the same manner. 

Fried Grits or Hominy. 

Gru ou Saccamite Frlte. 

To fry .grits or hominy, after the grain 
is boiled, let it cool. Then season with 
sMt and pepper, and spread on a biscuit 
board. When jperfectly cold cut Into 
slices and dust each slice with a little 
flour. Brush again with a beaten egg, 
and try in lard till a light brown. 
Lye Hominy or Samp. 
S'accamite a. la Lessive. 

This is an old-fashioned Creole way of 
preparing hulled corn. It is and has 
been much in vogue for many genera- 
tions throughout rural Louisiana. Th« 
corn is allowed to get very ripe, put to 
dry, and then hulled. It is then allowed 
to lie for many days, spread out upon a 
cloth, till thoroughly dried. An immense 
pot -s then filled with water, and a bag 
containing at least a quart or more of 
hardwood ashes is put into it. A good 
peck of the old, ripe, dry, hulled com is 
thrown in, and it is allowed to soak for 
at least twenty-four hours. The com Is 
then put to boil in these ashes till the 
husks or outer germs come off easily. 
Then the corn is thrown into the cold 
water and divested of the hulls by thor- 
ough rubbing with the hands. It is then 
washed in four or five waters, till every 
taste of potash disappears. 

Another way the Creoles of rural Lou- 
isiana have of preparing Lye Hominy 



124 



is to dilute the strong lye in water, and 
then boil the corn in this till the hull 
comes off. After thoroughly washing, 
the -com prepared after either way Is 
sent in large quantities to New Orleans, 
as well as used for home consumption. 
In cooking Lye Hominy, it is either 
boiled in water until the kernels are 
soft, as in other recipes for Hominy, 
making a delicious dish when served 
with milk, or cream., or it is ground or 
pounded into a flour, from which is made 
that famous Louisiana breakfast offer- 
ing, "Lye Hominy Bread." (See recipe 
under chapter on Breads.) This flour 
also finds a ready sale among the Cre- 
oles during summer. 

Cornmeal Mnsh. 
Bouillie de Farine de Mais. 

1 1-2 Cups of Cornmeal. 
2 Quarts of Boiling Water. 
1 1-2 Teaspoonfuls of Salt. 

Set the water to boil in a porcelain- 
lined or agate stewpot; add the salt, and 
when the light scum, comes on top skim 
it C'ff. Then add the fresh, sweet white 
cornmeal, putting a handful at a time 
into the water, and stirring with a spoon 
or a pudding stick, round and round, a.^ 
the meal falls lightly from the hand. 
When one handful is exhausted, refill it. 
and continue stirring and letting thp 
meal fall by degl'ees, until the puddim? 
stick will stand in it. This is the test. 
Continue stirring, and when sufficiently 
cooked, which will be in a half hour, as 
the bubbles begin to puff up, turn into 
a bowl, bring to the table (either hot or 
cold) and eat with milk, butter, sugar, 
syrup or with meat and gravy. 

In preparing this as a gruel for in- 
fants, take one-half cup of cornmeal, a 
quart of water, and let it boil for at least 
one hour, stirring often. When done, 
soften with boiled new milk, sweeten to 
taste and feed the infant with a spoon. 

Graham Meal Mush is prepared in the 
same manner as either of the above re- 
cipes. 

Milk Porridge. 

Bouillie de Lait. 

2 Tablespoonfuls of Indian Meal. 
1 Spoon of White Flour. 



3 Cups of Milk. 

1 1-2 Cups of Boiling Water. 

A Pinch of Salt. 

Bring the flour to a paste with a little 
cold water, and also scald the meal with 
a little hot water. Have the water boil- 
ing in the proportion given above; add 
the meal, and then add the flour, stirring 
constantly. Then let it boil for about 
twenty minutes, and add the pinch of 
salt and the milk, stirring almost con- 
stantly; then let all cook for ten minutes 
more, stirring often. Serve while hot, 
with sugar and milk. This is excellent 
for little children and invalids. 

BABLET. 

Orge. 

Barley is extensively used by the Cre- 
oles, especially in summer, for making 
soups. A good barley soup is consid- 
ered not only a most nutritious dish, but 
a very cooling one, and especially suited 
to a summer diet. A half cupful U 
thrown into the soup. (See recipe for 
Barley Soup.) Barley water is also ex- 
tensively used to cool the system, and 
also for delicate infants, with whom very 
often even sterilized milk does not agree, 
and it is found absolutely necessary to 
substitute some other article of diet. The 
Creole mothers first soak two tablespoon- 
fuls of barley in a little cold water for 
about an hour, and then, without drain- 
ing, pour this into the boiling water, 
which has been very slightly salted. This 
water is stirred very frequently and al- 
lowed to simmer for at least an hour. 
It is then strained and sweetened before 
it is used. Barley thus prepared is used 
extensively for invalids. Barley must al- 
ways be picked over and washed thor- 
oughly in several waters before using, 
and soaked in a little cold water. 

BUCKWHEAT. 

PVoment de Sarrasin. 

Buckwheat is not by any means a nu- 
tritive food, being far inferior to wheat 
and corn. It is never eaten alone, but 
in combination with flour, is used in 
making that delightful breaKfast ac- 
companiment, "Buckwheat Cakes." (See 
recipe, under Chapter on Breads.) 



CHAPTER XXVI. 
MACABONI. 



Macaroni. 



Macaroni is a general article of food 
in New Orleans among the rich and the 
poor. It is very cheap, and is a most ex- 
cellent dish. We have in New Orleans 
large Macaroni factories, where not only 
Macaroni is made by the Italians them- 
•selves, but the twin sisters of Macaroni, 
■S'paghetti and Vermicelli, are also manu- 
factured fresh dailv. While there Is no 
city in the United States in which Ma- 
caroni is cooked in real Italian style but 
New Orleans, which has long been a fa- 
vored point of migration for the sons of 
sunny Italy, the Creole cooks have modi- 
fied and improved upon the Italian 
methods, so that Macaroni a la Creole is 
just' as famous a dish as Macaroni a 
ritalienne, and by many considered far 
superior. 

How to Boil Macaroni 

Avoid breaking the macaroni as much 
as possible. Immerse it whole In a large 
saucepan of boiling water; add a table- 
spoonful of salt and one of butter. Lot 
the macaroni cook from twenty to twen- 



ty-five minutes; remove from the fire 
and drain in a colander. If not intended 
for immediate use, cover at once with 
cold water. AVhen cool, drain and use as 

needed. 

Boiled Macaroni, Italian Style. 

Macaroni a Tltalienne. 

1-2 Pound of Macaroni. 

1 Pound of Grated Parmesan Cheese. 

1 Tablespoonful Flour. 

1 Tablespoonful Butter. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

Break the macaroni into convenient 
lengths, and set to boil in a kettle filled 
with boiling water and in which you 
have thrown a spoonful of salt and black 
pepper. Be careful to keep the lengths 
of macaroni firm. When cooked till ten- 
der, take off and strain the water. Take 
one tablespoonful of butter and one of 
flour and put them on the fire, blending 
well. Have one pound of Parmesan 
cheese grated; add one-half of it to tUs 
flour and butter, and one pint of tbe 



125 



water in wJiich the macaroni was boiled; 
the mixture must not be allowed to 
brown; stir briskly. Place the macaroni 
by lengths into a dish, season well with 
salt and pepper, and warm a few min~ 
utes in the oven. When warm, take out 
the dish and sprinkle over it one- 
quarter of the pound of cheese that still 
remains; pour the hot sauce over this, 
and sfirinkle the rest of the cheese on 
top; serve hot. 

Boiled Spag-hettl, Italian Style. 

Spaghetti a I'ltalienne. 

1-2 Pound of Spaghetti. 

1 Pound of Grated Parmesan Cheese. 

1 Tablespoonful of Butter. 

1 Tablespoonful of Flour. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

Spaghetti a I'ltalienne is prepared in 
the sam.e manner as in the above recipe. 
S"pag[hetti is a more delicate form of mac- 
aroni. 

The Italians in New Orleans also simply 
boil the macaroni or spaghetti as men- 
tioned above, sprinkle it with grated 
cheese and salt and pepper, and serve 
with a rich tomato sauce (see recipe), 
and grated cheese, the latter served in 
separate plated. This latter is a very 
rich dish. 

Macaroni or Spaghetti thus cooked is 
served with daube and is a very palata- 
ble dish. 

Macaroni With Tomato Sauce. 

Macaroni a la Sauce Tomate. 

1-2 Pound of Macaroni. 

1 Gill of Tomato Sauce. 

1 Gill of Madeira Sauce or Wine.

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

A Dash of Cayenne. 

Boil the macaroni in salted water for 
twenty minutes, adding a tablespoonful 
of butter and an onion, wiith two cloven 
stuck in it. Then drain the macaroni of 
all water; place it in a saucepan with a 
gill of Tomato Sauce and one of Ma - 
deira Sauce or Madeira wine. Add a 
quarter of a pound of grated Parmesan 
cheese; season well with salt and pepper; 
add a dash of Cayenne, and let the mix- 
ture cook slowly for ten or fifteen min- 
utes, tossing frequently to prevent burn- 
ing. Place the Macaroni on a hot dish, 
pour the sauce over it, and serve with 
•grated Parmesan cheese passed in a sep- 
arate dish. Spaghetti may be prepared 
and served in the same manner. 

Macaroni, Creole Style. 

Macaroni a. la Creole. 

1-2 Pound of Macaroni. 

1-2 Can of Tomatoes, or 6 Fresh Ones. 

1 Tablespoonful Butter. 

1 Tablespoonful Flour. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

Bc'il the macaroni according to the re- 
cipe given above. WTien done, drain 
through a colander without breaking the 
lengths. Season well with salt and pep- 
per. Put one tablespoonful of butter in 
a frying pan and add one tablespoonful 
of flour; blend well and as it browns add 
the tcmatoes, which have been chopped 
■fine in their own juice. Let this stew, 
after stirring well for about ten minutes, 
and when it begins to boil add the mac- 
aroni or spaghetti, mixing well without 



brcP/king the lengths. Let it boil up once, 
an(^ then serye hot. The dish may be 
served with any meats. 

Manaronl or Spaghetti, Milanalse Style. 

Macaroni ou Spaghetti a, la Milanaise. 

1-2 Pound of Macaroni.

1 Bay Leaf. 
Salt, Pepper and Cayenne to Taste. 

Boil the macaroni in water and salt 
as in the recipe given for Boiling Mac- 
aroni. When tender, drain well through 
a colander. In the meantime, while it is 
boiling, put a tablespoonful of butter 
in a saucepan, and as it melts add the 
grated onion. Let this brown, and then 
add the ham which you will have minced 
very fine. Let this brown; add the 
cloves of garlic, minced very fine, and 
the herbs, minced very fine. Then 
add almost immediately, as these begin 
to brown, for bay leaf burns quickly, 
a half can of tomatoes, or six fresh large 
tomatoes. To this, as it stews, add a 
half pound of grated Parmesan cheese, 
and let all stew for about ten minutes; 
then add the macaroni or spaghetti, and 
let all simmer gently for about twenty 
minutes longer. Serve hot, and pass at 
the same time a small plate of grated 
Parmesan cheese to each person.

Boil the macaroni, and cut into pieces 
of about two inches long, after draining 
thoroughly. Place it in a saucepan with 
a half pint of Tomato Sauce and S'auce 
Espagnole (see recipe), and add the 
cheese. Add the herb bouquet, tied to- 
gether; cut the truffles and mushrooms 
and carrot into dice-shaped pieces; mince 
the celery and add ; then add the beef 
tongue cut into small dice-shaped pieces. 
To this add the Claret. Let all cook for 
about fifteen minutes, tossing frequently 
in the meantime. When ready to serve, 
remove the herb bouquet and send to the

Macaroni an Gratin. 

Macaroni au Gratin. 

1-2 Pound of .Macaroni or Spaghetti. 

1 Pound of Parmesan Cheese (Grated). 

1 Tablespoonful of Flour. 

1 Tablespoonful of Butter. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

Boil the macaroni by its length in wa- 
ter until soft. Do not let it cook too 
much, but just enough to be soft, and 
lift out of the water without breaking. 
This will require about a half hour of 
rapid boiling. When done, take out of 
the water in which it was boiled, and 
season well with salt and black pepper. 
Put a tablespoonful of butter, blended 



126 



well with flour, Into a pint of milk. Let 
it boil two minutes. PIa,oe a layer of 
the spaghetti or nriacaroni in the pan in 
which it is to be baked, seasoning again 
to taste, and mix in a layer of the 
grated cheese; sprinkle with pepper and 
salt; then put in alternately a layer of 
the macaroni and a layer of cheese, and 
so on until three-fourths of the cheese 
is used. Do not break the macaroni or 
spaghetti. Pour over this the boiling 
milk. Take the remaining quarter pound 
of cheese and sprinkle thickly on top, 
dot here and there with bits of butter, 
and put in a quick oven and let it bake 
to a nice brown. Serve in the dish in 
which it was baked. In cooking mac- 
aroni or spaghetti, cream or milk may 
be used always instead of water, using 
a pint of either in the above proportions. 
If you have not the milk, a pint of the 
water in which the macaroni was boiled 
will answer equally well. This recipe 
is highly recommended as the nicest way 
of i>reparing macaroni. 



Macaroni or Spaghetti With Daube. 

Daube au Macaroni ou au Spaghetti. 

1-2 Poun,d of Macaroni, 

A Veal or Beef Daube. 

1 Pint of Hot "Water or Broth. 

This is a popular Creole dish, and a 
very good one, too. Prepare a daube. 
(See recipe, "Boeuf a la Mode ou 
Daube"). After it has cooked about an 
hour and a salf, and is about two-thirds 
done, add the macaroni according to the 
number to be served, using between a 
quarter and a half pound for six, and 
cutting the macaroni into lengths of 
about five inches, to facilitate serving, 
liet it boil for about three-quarters of 
an hour In the daube, and if you see, on 
adding It, that there is not sufficient 
gravy for it to cook well, add a half pint 
or a pint more of hot water or hot broth, 
according as the macaroni appears to 
absorb after it has been in the pot four 
or five minutes. Cook Ttntil very tender, 
and on serving place the daube in the 
center of the dish and heap the macaroni 
around. 

Chicken and macaroni may be pre- 
pared In the same way. Both are excel- 
lent and favorite New Orleans ways of 
serving macaroni. They are also very 
healthy and nutritious family dishes. 

Spaghetti may also be cooked in either 
of these ways, and makes a more deli- 
cate dish. 



Tlmbale of Macaroni. 

Macaroni en Timbale. 

1-4 Pound of Macaroni or Spaghetti. 

1 Head of Bdam's Cheese. 

1-2 Pound of Grated Parmesan Cheese. 

1 Tablespoonful of Flour. 

1 Tablespoonful of Butter. 
Salt and Pepper to Taste. 
Nearly every family keeps a head of 
Edam's cheese for general use. When 
you have finished scooping out the cheese 
do not throw away the head, but keep it 
to make a Timbale Macaroni. Boil a 
little over one-quarter of a pound of 
macaroni, or sufficient to fill the head, 
according to the above directions (Boiled 
Macaroni). Wlien boiled, take out of the 
water and set in a dish. Take about 
half a pint of the liquor in which the 
macaroni was boiled, strain It and set it 
back on the stove; add the flour and 
butter blended, and three-quarters of the 
grated cheese, and let it boil five min- 
utes. Then pour this sauce over the 
macaroni in the dish and mix well, sea- 
soning with salt and pepper to taste. 
Fill the head with this mixture, and 
sprinkle on top the rest of the grated 
cheese. Set In the stove to bake, and, 
when nicely browned, serve hot from the 
shell of the cheese. The macaroni may 
also be baked in molds, but there Is no 
comparison to the Timbale when mad<* 
in the empty cheese head. This is a gen- 
uine Timbale of Macaroni, and" the only 
way to really make the dish. 
Macaroni Balls. 
Bouletfes de Macaroni. 
1 Cup of Cold Boiled Macaroni. 
1 Cup Boiling Milk'. 1 Tablespoonful 
Butter. 

2 Tablespoonfuls Flour. 

2 Tablespoonfuls of Grated Cheese. 

The Tolks of 4 Eggs. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

Put the butter Into a saucepan, and as 
it melts add the flour; do not let it 
brown. Add the cup of boiling milk and 
stir well. When It begins to thicken add 
the grated cheese, and lei It simmer for 
a few minutes longer; then take from 
the fire and add the beaten yolks of four 
eggs. Have the macaroni cut Into tiny 
bits and work it well into this mixture. 
Then set It aside to cool. When cold, 
take a little flour, rub it on your hands, 
and form the macaroni into small balls 
about two inches in length and one In 
thickness. Dip the balls into a well- 
beaten egg, roll well and then roll In 
grated cracker crumbs. Fry in boiling 
lard, and serve hot. 



CHAPTER XXVII. 
OHBESE. 

Du Fromage. 



Cheese is one of the most nutritious of 
all food substances, being not only sub- 
stantial, but especially rich in nitro- 
genous matter. Among scientists it ranks 
very high as an article of food. The 
Creoles hold that cheese Is a good aid to 
digestion, and If It is simply the Gruyere 
cheese or the plain "Fromage a I'Amer- 
Icaln," you will always see it passed 
around as a proper finish to a meal Just 
before the coffee Is brought In. 

So much for the cheese in Its natural 
state. In cooking, the Creoles use some 
very delightful forms, chief among which 
Is that old French preparation known as 



Cheese Bamafcins. 

Ramequlns de Fromage. 

6 Tablespoonfuls of Grated Cheese. 

1 1-2 Gills of Milk. 

The Tolks of 3 Begs. 

2 Tablespoonfuls of Butter. 

2 Ounces of Bread. 

1-2 Tablespoonful of Prepared Mustard. 

The Whites of 3 Bggs. 

Cayenne and Salt to Toiste. 

Put the milk on to boil, and add the 

bread, which you will have minced fine. 

Stir the milk and brea^ until very 

smooth, and then add the butter, stirring 



127 



well, and finally the gyrated cheese. Stir 
this for five minutes, letting it boil, and 
then take off the fire and add the beaten 
yolks of three eggs. Have the whites 
ready, beaten to a stiff froth, and stir 
them in very gently. Season to taste. 
Grease a baking dish with butter and 
pour the mixture into the dish, set in a 
quick oven, and let it bake for a quar- 
ter of an hour. Serve hot. 

Cheese Souffle. 

Souffle de Fromage. 

1-4 Pound of Grated Cheese. 

1 Gill of Fresh Cream or Milk. 

3 Creole Eggs. 1 Teaspoonful of Flour. 

2 Tablespoonfuls of Butter. 

1 Pinch of Grated Nutmeg. 

1 Pinch Cayenne. Salt to Taste. 

Grate the cheese very fine and then 
add to it the boiling milk; add grad- 
ually the pepper, Cayenne and salt. Then 
add the butter and flour, rubbed well 
together. When the cheese is well dis- 
solved, take the mixture off; then add 
nutmeg and the beaten yolks of three 
eggs and the whites of two eggs beaten 
to a froth; stir the whole well. Place all 
in a shallow earthen dl'sh, add a little 
butter that has been well melted and put 
in the stove for a few minutes till it 
begins to solidify well; then take out 
and spread on top the white of one egg, 
beaten to a stiff froth. Set one minute 
In the stove, let it brown slightly and 
serve immediately. 

Toasted' Cheese. 

Fromage sur Canapes. 

1-2 Pound of Cheese. 6 Slices of Bread. 
Salt and Cayenne to Taste. 

Toast the bread nicely and butter it. 
Cut the cheese into very thin slices and 
hold to the fire, letting it toast nicely, 
first on one side and then on the other. 
Lay this upon the buttered toast and 
serve hot. This is a very nice delicacy 
for breakfast, or for an evening in win- 
ter when seated around the home fire. 

Cheese Straws. 

Failles de Fromage. 

1 Cup of Grated Parmesan or Gruyere 

1 Cup Flour. 1 Tablespoonful Butter. 

Yolk of an Egg. 

Salt and Cayenne to Taste. 

Blend the flour and cheese together 
and add at the same time the salt and 
Cayenne; then moisten with a well- 
beaten egg and one tablespoonful of 
melted butter, and work all gently Into a 
paste. Roll out on a biscuit board into 
thin strips of not more than an eighth 
of an inch in thickness, and. cut into 
strips of four Inches in length and one- 
eighth of an inch in width. Place on 
buttered sheets of paper and bake in a 
very hot oven until a light brown. It is 
very pretty to make little rings of some 
of the strips and pass the others through 
them in little bundles like gathered 
bound bits of straw. This Is a very 
dainty dish. 

Welsh Rarebit. 
Fromage Fondu a la Biere. 

2 Cups of Grated Cheese (Very Eich). 

1-2 Cup of Milk. The Tolks of 2 Eggs, 

Salt and Cayenne to Taste. 

Toast the bread nicely In square slices 
and cut off the crusts. Butter nicely 
while very hot and then plunge them into 
a bowl of boiling milk. Place them on a 



heated dish and stand in the oven to 
keep hot while you proceed to make the 
"Rarebit." Have a porcelain-lined sauce- 
pan; and set a half cup of milk in it 
over a moderate fire; when it is boiling 
hot add the cheese which has been finely 
grated; stir unceasingly till the cheese 
melts, and then add the salt, Cayenne 
and the yolks of the eggs and pour over 
the toasted bread. Serve hot. In mak- 
ing this "Delicatesse," the cheese must 
be very rich or it will be tough and 
stringy, because poor cheese will not 
melt. 

Cheese Biscuits. • 

Biscuits de Fromage. 

1-4 Pound of Butter. 1-4 Pound of Flour. 

5 Ounces of Grated Swiss Cheese. 

1-2 Tablespoonful of Mustard. 

Tolks of 5 Eggs. A Dash of Cayenne. 

Beat the butter to a cream; add the 

yolks of the eggs, well beaten, and mix 

well. Then add gradually the grated 

cheese, mustard and Cayenne. Add the 

flour gradually, beating in thoroughly, 

and make a stiff dough. Roll it out and 

cut into square or round biscuits. Bake 

in a rather slow oven for twenty minutes 

and serve. 

Cheese Fondn. 

Fromage Fondu. 
1 Cup of Grated Parmesan or Gruyere 

0hG6S6 

2 Tablespoonfuls of Sifted Flour. 
2 Tablespoonfuls of Butter. 3 Creole 
Eggs. 
1-2 Cup of Fresh Milk or Cream. 
A Pinch of Grated Nutmeg. 
Salt and Pepper to Taste. 
Put the butter into a saucepan and 
melt, and add the flour, blending with- 
out allowing it to brown. Add imme- 
diately, the boiling milk, and let It boll 
tor two minutes. Then remove from the 
fire and stir in the yolks of three eggs, 
well beaten; then salt, pepper, nutmeg 
and the grated cheese. Mix all thor- 
oughly. Have ready a small pudding 
dish, or, better still, several small souffle 
dishes. Butter these well. Have the 
whites of the eggs beaten to a stiff froth, 
beat them into the mixture and fill the 
dishes about two-thirds full. Then bake 
in a moderate oven for about twenty-five 
minutes. Serve immediately, or He mix- 
ture which has risen to the top of the 
dishes will fall. 

Cream Cheese 

Fromage a la Creme. 

Cream Cheese is always made from 
clabbered milk. 

The clabber is placed In a long bag 
of muslin and put to drain, the bag be- 
ing tied tightly and hung out over night 
In a cool place. When ready for use, 
the bag is opened and the cheese is taken 
out and beaten till light. It is then 
placed in these perforated molds, and 
when the time comes for serving it is 
taken out, placed in a dish, and sweet 
cream is poured over It. It is eaten with 
sugar or salt, more generally sugar. 

Frozen cream cheese is a very delicious 
summer dish with the Creoles. Some 
persons, after skimming the cream from 
the sour milk, stand the pan on the back 
of the stove, and scald the clabber with 
about three quarts of boiling water be- 
fore putting in the bag to drain. Again, 
some use only the perforated tins, 
instead of the muslin bag, but the best 
results are obtained by the former an- 
cient Creole method, ^ream cheese cor- 
responds to the German "Schmler Kase."

CHAPTER XXVIII. 
CANAPES. 

Canapes. 



No book on Creole cookery would be 
complete without reference to the de- 
lightful "Canapes" that are so extensive- 
ly used at breakfasts, luncheons, dinners 
or suppers, and whose methods of prep- 
aration, distinctively Creole, have added 
to the reputation of the Creole cuisine. 
"Canape" is a French term, literally 
meaning a "couch" or "bed." In the cu- 
• Unary sense it is used as a bed on which 
to rest Savory foods. Usually the Canape 
Is the form of sliced bread, or toast, or 
crackers, covered with finely minced 
meats, pastes, etc., and handsomely dec- 
orated. It is a term that is also applied 
to the ordinary "Sandwich." 

AnchoTy Canapes. 

Canapes d'Anchois. 

6 Slices of Dry Toast.

First prepare the Anchovy Butter by 
adding to one ounce of good regular but- 
ter one teaspoonful of Anchovy Bssence. 
Mix well and set on ice till ready to use. 

Prepare six slices of bread, slicing them 
about one-half an inch thick and toast- 
ing to a golden brown. Trim the edges 
nicely and spread over each a little An- 
chovy Butter, and then cover each with 
four Anchovies cut in halves, or pounded 
to a paste, according to taste. Place the 
toasts on a tin baking sheet in an oven 
for one minute, and then arrange neatly 
on a folded napkin on a dish and serve.

egar, which have been well mixed. 
Spread over the toast and sarnish nicely 
with the aspic jelly, ard place on a fold-

Be careful to stir constantly. Pour this 
over the toast; pi. ice on a dish on a fold- 
ed napkin and ser\'e. Again, the circles 
of toast may be used as a foundation, 
the edges being spread with Anchovy 
butter, with an onion ring at its base. 
Fill this decorated ring with the Caviars, 
place on a folded napkin on a dish and 
serve.

a game forcemeat (Woodcock, Snipe, 
Reed Birds, etc.). Decorate the edges 
with a forcemeat of game of different 
color, for effect, and serve. The wild 
ducli, the meat of -which is darlc, may-

either butter or onion to brown. Add a 
tablespoonful of flour, and stir constant- 
ly for a minute and a half, and then add 
a gill of broth or water, if the broth is 
not convenient. Stir well and let this 
mixture cook for five minutes, stirring

CHAPTER XXIX 
VEGETABIiES 

Des Le grumes 



Louisiana is peculiarly favored in re- 
spect to the variety of vegetables that 
can be grown on her soil. Almost all the 
sturdier varieties of vegetables and all 
the more delicate -land recherche are 
grown here in abundance. The soil is so 
rich and fruitful that it has been said 
that if you simply scatter the seed over 
the ground, without any effort at culti- 
vation, it would still take root and a 
good crop would follow. Our climate 
also admits of two seasons of planting, 
-SO that we have both an early spring and 
autumn crop; the one extends far into 
the summer and verging upon the 
autumn, and the other till late in the 
winter and verging upon the early 
spring. Consequently, vegetables are al- 
ways to be found in abundance in our 
markets. 

ABTICHOKBS. 

Des Artichauts. 

Artichokes are of two kinds: The 
French or Green Globe Artichokes, which 
have large scaly heads, like the cones of 
a pine, and the Jerusalem Artichokes. 
The latter are little esteemed by the fas- 
tidious, the preference being always 
given to the former, which is a more 
delicate and tender variety, and a popu- 
lar favorite. In Louisiana the Jerusalem 
Artichoke is cultivated principally for 
its tubers, which are very valuable for 
stock and hog feeding, owing to their 
fattening properties. But, if boiled or 
made into a puree, these artichokes will 
be found not only a pleasant, but most 
nutritious food. French Artichokes may 
be boiled or stuffed or fried. 

To tell if a French Artichoke is ten- 
der, lift up one of the scales that lie 
near the body of the vegetable. If it 
breaks without effort, the vegetable is 
young; otherwise, the artichoke will be 
tough and disagreeable to eat. 

French Artichokes Boiled. 
Artichauts Francais Bouillis. 

6 Tender Fresh Artichokes. 1 Table- 
spoonful of Vinegar. 
1 Teaspoonful of Salt. Sauce, according 
to Taste. 

Strip off the coa^e outer leaves, or, 
better still, cut the stalks close with a 
pair of scissors, and trim the sharp 
points from the leaves, removing about 
a quarter of an inch of each. Cut the 
stalks about an inch from the bottom. 
Throw in cold water and wash well, 
adding a little vinegar to draw out any 
lurking insects. Have on the stove a pot 
of boiling water, and add a teaspoonful 
of salt. Throw in the artichokes and 



boil gently until it is possible to draw 
out a leaf easily, or until the outer leaves 
are tender. Take from the fire and drain 
upon a dish, placing them upside down, 
so that the water may all run off. Stand 
on their stalks in another dish when 
thoroughly drained, and serve hot with a 
Drawn Butter Sauce, Sauce a la Maitre 
d'Hotel or a Sauce a la Hollandaise. 

The time for boiling an artichoke de- 
pends entierly on the age and size of 
the vegetable, and requires all the way 
from twenty-five minutes to an hour.

spoonful of vinegar to the water. After 
five minutes remove the artichokes and 
drain thoroughly. Place in a saucepan 
or sautire, with two good tablespoon- 
fuls of butter. Cover the pan tight and 
set to cook in a moderate oven for twen- 
ty-five minutes. Then take the artichokes

Pull off a few of the coarse leaves, and 
then scoop out the artichoke, without 
touching the "fond," or bottom meat, 
and without breaking Uie outer scales 
or leaves from the sides and around. 
The artichoke must be apparently whole 
and undisturbed. Then chop an onion, 
or, rather, mince it very fine, and mince 
two cloves of garlic and half a square 
inch of ham very, very fine. Take a 
quarter of a can of mushrooms and 
mince them fine. Mix all this together 
as a stuffing, and season well with salt, 
pepper and Cayenne. Put a tablespoon- 
ful of butter in a frying pan, and fry the 
dreKsing in it for about five of ten 'min- 
utes. Take off the fire, and stuff each 
artichoke from the center, which you 
will have scooped, beginning just above 
the heart or "fond" of the artichoke. 
Pour over each a spoonful of broth or 
consomme, or water; sprinkle lightly 
with bread crumbs; put a dot of butter 
on e^ch. and set in the oven and bake 
for five minutes, till the crumbs are

twenty minutes. Add a teaspoonful of 
salt and cook ten minutes longer. Take 
the asparagus up nicely. Drain off all 
water. Lay on a folded napkin, and

recipe.) Asparagus is generally bought 
in New Orleans in cans, being very nice- 
ly prepared. It requires simply to be 
set on the stove and allowed to heat, 
as it is already cooked. Take out of the 
can by turning it downward in a dish, 
letting the asparagus slide gently out.

BKANS. 

Des Haricots. 
Beans, whether white or red, are 
among the most nutritious of food sub- 
stances. In all the ancient homes of 
New Orleans, and in the colleges and 
convents, where large numbers of chil- 
dren are sent to be reared to be strong 
and useful men and women, several times 
a week there appear on the table either 
the nicely cooked dish of Red Beans, 
which are eaten with rice, or the equally 



133 



wholesome White Beans a la Creme, or 
Red or White Beans -boiled with a piece 
of salt pork or ham. String Beans a la 
Sauce de Maitre d'Hotel, or boiled with 
a piece of salt pork or ham, are also 
classed among the especially nutritious 
beans. The Creoles hold that the boys 
and girls who are raised on beans and 
rice and beef will be among the strongest 
and sturdiest of people. 

String Beans With Butter Sauce. 

Haricots Verts a la Maitre d'Hotel. 

2 Quarts of Fresh, Tender String Beans.

Pepper to Taste. 

Always select tender beans. Break the 
blossom end, and pull it backward, re- 
moving the string. Then be careful to 
pare the thin strip from the other end 
of the bean pod. It is only in this way 
that you will be sure that every inch of 
string is removed. Split the larger beans 
down the pod, and let the younger and 
more tender remain whole. Wash them 
in clear, cold water, letting them stand 
about ten minutes. Then drain off the 
water, put the beans into a saucepan, 
cover well with boiling water, and let 
them boil for forty minutes or an hour, 
according to the tenderness of the beans. 
Just before serving drain off water, put 
a large tablespoonful of butter into the 
beans, mix well, salt and pepper to taste, 
and serve hot.

and put them into this, and let them boil 
forty minutes or an hour longer. Sea- 
son with pepper only, and serve, placing 
the salt pork or ham in the center of the 
dish, and heaping the beans around. This 
is an excellent "way of utilizing the ham 
bone which is left over from the boiled 
ham. The Creoles like the flavoring of 
ham or salt pork in vegetables. A bit 
of fine herbs, nicely minced, and one 
onion, minced fine, greatly add to the 
flavor of this dish.

exactly the same manner as Red Beans a 
la Maitre d'Hotel. Before adding the 
butter, however, add a minced sprig of 
thyme, bay leaf and parsley, and salt 
and pepper to taste. Let them simmer 
for a few minutes on the fire, and then 
take off and add the juice of a lemon.

COWPEAS. 

Pois Congrris. 

These peas are utilized by the Creoles 
in making that famous dish, "Jambalaya 
au Congri." (See recipe under heading 
"Louisiana Rice.") On Fridays the rice 
and peas, which are always boiled sep- 
arately, must not be cooked with meat. It 
tliis day is kept as a fast day. The peas 
and rice are mixed well together and are 
eaten with butter. 

BUTTBBBEANS. 

Feves Plates. 
1 Pint of Butterbeans. 2 Pints of Water. 

1 Tablespoonful (Heaping) of Butter. 
Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

The Butterbean is one of the most re- 
cherche and delicate of our Louisiana 
vegetables. Soak the Butterbeans for 
about a half hour in water. Pour off 
this cold fresh water, and then put them 
in a porcelain-lined saucepan, or one of 
agate, and cover with two pints of water. 
Let them boil well for about an hour, or 
less, if they are very tender. As soon as 
they crush easily under pressure take off 
the fire, drain off water, season well 
with salt and pepper. Butter well with 
a heaping tablespoonful of butter, add a 
teaspoonful of parsley, minced very fine, 
and serve hot. 

LIMA BEANS. 

Haricots a Rames. 

1 Pint of Lima Beans. 3 Pints of Water. 

1 TablespaQjiful of Flour. 

1 Tablespoonful of Butter. 1-2 Pint of 

Cream. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

Soak the small ones over night. Drain 
the water when about to cook, and put 
in a porcelain or agate saucepan, and 
cover with three pints of boiling water. 
Boil them until very tender, which will 
require' at least two hours. After they 
have boiled one hour, add a teaspoonful 
of salt, or salt to taste. When done, 
drain the beans and return to the sauce- 
pan. Add a half pint of cream or milk, 
a tablespoonful of flour, blended well 
with butter, salt and pepper to taste, a 
sprig each of thyme and parsley and bay 
leaf minced very fine. Let all simmer 
for ten minutes, and then serve hot. Or 
the beans may be served without the 
cream, simply buttering well and adding 
salt and pepper to taste. All shelled 
beans, such as the Kidney and the small 
French bean, may be cooked in the same 
way. 

Bean Croquettes. 
Haricots en Croquettes. 

1 Pint of Beans. 1 Tablespoonful of 

Butter. 

S'alt and Cayenne to Taste. 

Any remains of left-over beans may be 
nicely utilized in this way. Mash the 
beans well by pressing through a colan- 
der. Then add salt and pepper to taste, 
a teaspoonful of vinegar, and a table- 
spoonful of melted butter. Form into 
small boulettes. or balls, and dip in a 
raw egg, well beaten, and then roll in 
the bread crumbs. Fry in boiling fat. 
and serve hot. 

BEETS 
Des Betteraves. 

We have in New Orleans two crops of 
beets, the winter beet and the summer 
beet. Summer beets require less time to 
boil than the winter. Good Judgment 
must always be the guide. 



Beets may be kept several days when 
boiled, and make a beautiful garnish. 

The small winter beets may be served 
aux Beurre Maitre d'Hotel, or they may 
be sauted in butter or served Sautees a 
la Creme or a la Bechamel. Beet roots 
are generally served as a salad or gar- 
nish. Always cut off .and save the green 
tops of the beets. These may be boiled 
with salt meat, or made into a puree, or 
used in the famous Creole Gumbo aux 
Herbes. 

Boiled Beets. 

Betteraves Bouillis. 

6 Beet Roots. 2 Quarts of Water. 

A Plain French Dressing (if served as a, 

salad) . 

Cut off the beet tops and save for 
boiling or puree or gumbo. Soak the 
beets in cold fresh water, and wash well, 
taking off every particle of earth that 
may adhere. Wash them carefully, with- 
out scraping them. If the beet is very 
tender, it will cook in an hour. Older 
beets require all the way from three to 
four hours according to size. If the beet 
is wilted or tough, no amount of boiling 
will ever make it perfectly tender. If 
you break the skins of the beets before 
cooking, the flavor will be lost, as well 
as the color, when boiled. Put the beets 
into a pot of cold water, covering well, 
and boil until tender. Then set them to 
cool. When cold, slice nicely and sprin- 
kle with salt and pepper to taste, and 
add vinegar, and set aside for an hour, 
for the vinegar to penetrate thoroughly. 
Serve as a salad. 

Buttered Beets. 

Betteraves au Beurre. 
6 Beet Roots.' 1 Tablespoonful of Butter. 
Salt and Pepper to Taste. 
The small winter beets may be served 
aux Beurre Maitre d'Hotel, by cookmg

melted butter, and sprinkling nicely with 
salt and pepper. Vinegar may also be 
added at the table, according to the 
taste.

Borecole or Curled Kale. 

Chou Vert. 

This is a vegetable cultivated by Lou- 
isiana truck farmers principally for fam- 
ily use. It requires frost to make it good 
for the table. It is treated and served in 
the same manner as cabbage: all recipes 
for cooking cabbage may, therefore, be 
used in preparing Chou Vert. 

BBOCCOI.I. 

Chou Broccoli. 

Broccoli is a vegetable of the same or- 
der as the Cauliflower, and resembles it 
very much, only the plant does not form 
such compact heads, and is not quite so 
white, being of a greenish cast. It is 
prepared and served in all ways in which 
Cauliflower is served. (See recipes for 
Cauliflower.)

remained about twenty min,utes in the 
water. Then put them into half a gallon 
of boiling water, and add immediately a 
tablespoonful of salt and a quarter of a 
spoon of bicarl)onate of soda (cooking 
soda). Let the sprouts boil (uncovered) 
for twenty minutes, or just long enough 
to make them tender all through. By no 
means must they be soft, or go to pieces. 
Boil rapidly. Then drain in a colander, 
season well with pepper and salt, and 
serve in a heated dish with a Drawn But- 
ter Sauce poured over. (See sauces.)

minutes, but do not let them boil. Place 
on a hot dish, garnish nicely and serve 
hot. 



CABBAGE. 

Du Chou. 

Cabbage is said to be the most nutri- 
tious of all vegetables. It enters largely 
into the daily life of the Creoles, not 
only in the boiled and creamed and 
stuffed states, but also in that most de- 
lightful Creole dish. Gumbo Choux. We 
have two crops of cabbage in New Or- 
leans, the summer and winter. It is said 
that when cabbage is cooking the odor 
fills the house. But the Creoles over- 
come this by using a very large pot 
when boiling cabbage, dropping in a bit 
of charcoal, and not filling it too near 
the brim, as the old darkies say it is the 
boiling water that forms into steam and 
causes the odor. Again, they tie a piece 
of bread in a very fine and thin white 
piece of cloth. After it has been in the 
pot about twenty minutes remove it and 
burn, for the odor of the cabbage has 
clung to it. Repeat the process with a 
fresh piece of cloth and bread for about 
three-quarters of an hour. 

Boiled Cabbage. 

Chou Boullli. 

A Fine Head of Green and White 

Cabbage. 

1 Teaspoonful of Salt. 1 Red Pepper 

Pod.

For boiling, select a fine head in which 
the green and white are prettily mingled. 
The white makes the prettiest dish. Re- 
move all the outside leaves and reject 
them. Then cut the cabbage head into 
quarters, and let it soak in cold water 
for about an hour. Then drain well, 
and pull off each leaf separately to dis- 
cover any lurking insects, and throw 
each leaf into a pan or fresh water. 
Drain thoroughly, and put Into a large 
pot of boiling water with a pound of 
ham or salt pork, and let it cook for an 
hour or more, until render. After it 
has been in the water ten minutes add 
a teaspoonful of salt and a red pepper 
pod, cut in two. Add a teaspoonful of 
Chili i>epper. Cover the cabbage and boil 
for one hour, if the cabbage is very 
young and tender; boil for two hours or 
more if not. W^hen done drain well of 
all water, and place in a dish with the 
salt meat or ham on top, and serve hot 
Cabbage is always eaten with a little 
vinegar. The Creoles serve boiled cab- 
bage with the pepper vinegar which they 
put up themselves. 

Cabbage and Corned Beef. 

Chou et Boeuf au Mi-sel.

above recipe, and let all boil for two 
hours longer. When done, put the cab- 
bage in a dish, with the meat in the 
center, and serve with tomato catsup or 
horseradish or mustard sauce. The cab- 
bage may be put in the pot after having 
been cut in four quarters and soaked, 
but it is always safer to pick over each 
leaf, for tear of insects.

SAUERKRAUT. 

Chou-Croute. 

1 Fine Head of Cabbage. 1 Pint of 

Vinegar. 

1 Bottle of White Wine. 

1 Glass of Brandy or Whisky. 

Salt in Sufficient Quantity to Allow 3 

Ounces for Each Layer of Cabbage. 

To prepare Chou-Croute, take a large 
head of cabbage, and take off the green 
leaves. Shred the cabbage into fine 
pieces, of about five inches long and one 
"wide. Then get an earthen vessel or a 
keg, and line the bottom and sides with 
the green leaves of the cabbage. Put In 
a layer of salt, of about three ounces 
and lay over this a layer of cabbage 
leaves of about three inches in thickness. 
Cover again with a layer of salt, and 
pound down well, and so continue until 
you have used up the ctibbage. Pour 
over this sufficient vinegar to cover, and 
also, If possible, a bottle of AVhite wine 
and a glass of Brandy or WTiisky. Take 
some boards or the cover of the keg and 
line them with cabbage leaves, and cover 
the keg closely. Put the cover on the 
keg, or the board over the bowl, with a 
fifteen-pound weight on top. Set it In a 
place of even moderate temperature. Bore 
a hole in the bottom of the keg, and In- 
sert a piece of wood. When the cabbage 
begins to ferment, take the piece of 
wood out, and let the liquor from the 
fermentation flow through this canal. 
This will be In about four or five days. 



After this first operation open the keg 
and renew the vinegar and wine, skim- 
ming the fermentation from the top, and 
so continue until the cabbage Is clear 
and without odor. The Chou-Croute 
should be placed in a cool place. When 
ready to use take it out and let it soak 
for two or three hours in cool fresh wa- 
ter, and when quite fresh-looking put it 
into a saucepan and cook as you would 
cabbage, with salt meat, pork, sausage 
or corned beef.

and crevice. "WTien these crevices are 
full, and the cauliflower seems to have 
absorbed all, wipe the edges and all 
around the dish with a napkin. Then 
add grated bread crumbs, sprinkling 
them over the cauliflower; dot it in 
about a dozen places with little bits of 
butter. Set it in the oven, let it brown, 
and serve hot. Let it bake about twenty 
minutes, or until brown.

bling parsley, and much used for season- 
ings, especially in oyster soux>s. It is 
also considered a delightful salad herb, 
and is often cut and mixed between let- 
tuce, and served as a_salad. It is found 
in small quantities, chopped, in nearly 
all salads prepared to suit the taste of 
epicures. It is a plant little known in 
the North, but in this section there Is 
scarcely a garden where it is not found. 
It is especially used by the Creoles as a 
flavoring for breakfast salads, a few 
leaves imparting a delightful flavor.

an entree, like mashed potatoes. 

CHIVES 

Clves. 

Chives are small bulbous plants of the 
onion tribe. The leaves are long and 
slender and impart a very pleasant flavor 
to soups, salads, etc. Chives are espe- 
cially used in seasoning stews of rabbits 
and hare, hence the name "Civet," ap- 
plied to these stews in particular, on ac- 
count of the high seasoning. 
COI.I.ABDS. 

This is a variety of cabbage which does 
not head, but the leaves are cooked and 
served in the same manner as other cab- 
bage. But they are served, principally, 
as "greens." boiled with a piece of salt 
meat. 

COBN. 
Du Mais. 

Corn in various ways is served on the 
Creole tables. The first young corn in 
the market is highly prized, but in a few 
days there is such an over-abundance 
that it can be had all summer and late 
in the fall at prices within the reach of 
all There is not a healthier or more nu- 
tritious vegetable. The following are 
some of the dainty ways of preparing 
this delightful dish: 

Corn on the Cob. 
Bpis de Mais Bouillis. 

6 Bars of Corn. 2 Quarts of Boiline 
Water. 
1 Tablespoonful of Salt. 
Only young and tender corn should 
be boiled. Have ready a pot of boiling 
water. Remove the green outside husks 
and the silk, as far as possible. Put the 
corn into the kettle of boiling water, 
and let it boil rapidly twenty or thirty 
minutes, if the ears are large. More than 
this will cause the corn to lose its sweet- 
ness. Serve immediately after removing 
again all the sillc, which easily comes 
to the surface in boiling. Heap the corn 
on a platter, and serve to each person 
an ear, with a small butter plate of but- 
ter, pepper and salt. 

Oreen Corn, Planters' Style. 
Mais Tendre a I'Habltant. 

6 Bars of Corn.

1 Tablespoonful of S'alt. 



142 



Husk the corn and pull off the silk, 
leaving one layer of leaves clo^e to the 
kernels; put to cook in cold water. When 
the water begins to boil, after ten min- 
utes, add the salt, but do not let the corn 
boil longer than five minutes after add- 
ing the salt, as boiling longer will harden 
it. Corn cooked in this manner pre- 
serves its sweetness and is most palata- 
ble and tender. 

Boasted Com. 

Mais Rotis. 

Place the ears of corn which have not 
been removed from the husks In a hot 
oven, or, better still, if you can, In hot 
ashes, and let them roast for a half hour 
or more, until tender. Then take out of 
the oven or hot ashes and remove the 
husks and silk and serve In the same 
manner as boiled corn.

With the knife press out all the pulp 
from the cob, leaving the hull on the 
cob. S'et a porcelain or agate saucepan 
on the fire, and put into this the corn 
cobs, which you will have cut into pieces. 
Cover with water, and let them boll 
until you have extracted all the juices. 
When the liquid is reduced to about one 
pint, add the corn, and let it boil for 
about twenty minutes. Then stir in a 
quartei of a pint of milk, season with 
salt and pepper to taste, add a teaspoon- 
ful of butter, and serve hot. Or, if you 
can afford it, boil the corn in the milk, 
using at least one pint, having first 
added a half cup of water in which 
the corn cobs were boiled. Ijet all sim- 
mer gently for about a half hour, and 
then add salt and pepper to taste, and a 
spoonful of butter, and serve. Some like 
the addition of a teaspoonful of sugar, 
but this is a matter of taste.

Corn Salad. 

Mache ou Doucette. 

This Is a delicious variety of corn, and 
is much used for salads during the win- 
ter and early spring months in New Or- 
leans. The Corn Salad, for that is the 
name given to the vegetable, is boiled 
and then served "a la Vinaigrette," that 
Is, with vinegar, salt and pepper, or with 
a plain French Dressing; or with beets, 
sliced. Still again, it is served with hard- 
boiled eges. (See recipe.) 

CBESS. 

Cresson. 

This is one of the most popular Creole . 
winter and spring salad plants, and Is 
also considered a great appetizer, being 
served as an hors d'oeuvre, and eaten 
simply with salt. As a salad it Is most 
cooling, refreshing and healthy. We have 
two varieties, the broad-leaved winter 
"Curled or Pepper Grass," and the 
"Watercress." The latter can only be 
planted by the side of running water, or 
near springs. It is delicious. It Is found 
all through the Louisiana forests, along 
the streams especially In the vicinity of 
Abita Springs and Covington. 

CtrCTTMBEB. 

Concombre. 

The Creoles hold, and justly, that the 
only proper way to eat a cucumber Is 
"en salade." No fashionable method of 
cooking this vegetable can ever make 
up for the delicate flavor that has been 
destroyed by submitting it to heat. 

Cucumbers are best when freshly 
picked from the vine. When they are 
thrown around the market for a num- 
ber of days and become whited they 
are not fit for table use. Cucumbers are 
extensively used by the Creoles for salad 
and pickling purposes. For salad prep- 
arations see special recipe under chapter 
on Salads. The word "Gherkin" is ap- 
plied to all kinds of pickled cucumbers; 
properly, however, the term should be 
applied to the small prickly variety. Cu- 
cumbers, besides being served as salads 
and pickles, are used as relishes and as 
a garnish. 

encumbers as a Relish. 

Concombres Comme Hors d'Oeuvres. 

4 Fine Cucumbers. A French Salad 

Dressing. 

Wash the cucumbers, cut off the bitter 
end, and pare the skin to a sufficient 



depth to remove the green portion. Then 
score them lengthwise with a table fork. 
Put them into a salad earthen bowl and 
sprinkle with salt. Set in an Ice box 
for three hours; then cut into delicate 
slices and serve with a French Salad 
Dressing, the dressing being served in 
a separate dish. In preparing cucum- 
bers to serve as a relish with fish this Is 
the proper mode of preparation. 

encumbers as a Garnish. 

Concombres Comme Garniture. 

3 Fine Cucumbers. 

1 Tablespoonful of Vinegar. 1 Large

verized together and thoroughly mixed 
It IS extensively used in the making of 
stews of fish meats and some vege- 
tables. 

DANBBIiIOM. 

Dent-de-Llon. 

The Creoles long ago discovered the 
possibilities of the dandelion under cul- 
tivation. The wild dandelion, as all 
know. Is a common and hardy perennial 
plant. It is found in luxuriance in the 
Louisiana meadows and pastures, the 
deeply-notched leaves closely resembling 
chicoree, so extensively used as a salad 
and as a green. Through cultivation the 
dandelion Is now numbered among the 
best of the early spring salads. (For 
recipe for Dandelion Salad, see chapter 
on Salads.)

fine; season with butter, pepper and salt. 
Mince the ham very fine and sprinkle 
over the greens; spread over sliced hard- 
boiled eggs and serve hot.

an hour, or until tender. Then take out 
of the water and set to cool. "Wlien 
quite cool take out the seeds and throw 
away. Then scoop out carefully the soft 
meat of the eggplant, and leave the skins 
unbroken. Set these skins carefully aside. 
Chop the soft eggplant fine, and then 
wet and squeeze one and a half cups of 
bread. Chop the onion and tomato fine, 
and mince the herbs and garlic very fine. 
Season the eggplant well with salt and 
pepper. Put the butter in the frying 
pan (use a tablespoonful of lard, if you 
have not the butter), and brown the 
onion in it slightly. Then add the 
chopped tomato and its juice, and let this 
fry for four or five minutes. Then add 
the minced herbs and the clove of garlic, 
and almost immediately the chopped egg- 
plant. Then add the bread at once, and 
mix all well. Season again to taste, and 
let all fry for about five minutes. Take 
off and fill the shells with the stuffing, 
sprinkle the top lightly with bread 
crumbs, dot with butter and set in the 
oven to bake to a nice brown.

ENDIVES. 

De la Chicoree. 

Endive, or Chicoree, is served both as 
a salad plant and as a vegetable. It is 
very popular among the Creoles, and is 
much cultivated for the market, espe- 
cially for summer use. Chicoree as a 
salad is served in exactly the same man- 
ner as Lettuce Salad. (See recipe under 
chapter on Salads.)

drain and cut into quarters. Pnt the 
piece of bacon in the bottom of a sau- 
toire or stewpan, and add an onion and 
carrot and herb bouquet, minced very 
fine. Lay the Chicoree on top of this,

and a half teaspoonful of black pep- 
per, and cover with a buttered paper. 
Then set the sautoire in the oven, and 
let the Chicoree cook for ten minutes, 
when it will be a golden brown. Moisten 
with half a pint of veal or chicken con- 
somme, cover and again set in the oven 
for thirty minutes. At this point it will 
be ready to serve. Arrange the Chicoree 
on a hot dish; strain the sauce, pour 
over and serve. 

GARLIC. 

De I'Ail. 

Garlic is a great Creole vegetable, a 
bulbous-rooted plant, with a strong pene- 
trating odor, and highly esteemed as a 
flavoring for soups, stews, roasts and 
various other dishes. Garlic is a staple 
product of the lower Louisiana parishes, 
and is raised for home consumption and 
tor shipping. More garlic is grown and 
used in Louisiana than in all the other 
states together. It is cultivated like the 
onion. In the spring the bulbs are taken 
up and plaited together in long strings. 
One of these strings contains from fifty 
to sixty heads in double I'ows. They are 
then hung up In a drv, airy place, or 



145 



stored away. They will keep from six 
to eight months. Great strings of garlic 
adorn the stalls of the French Market 
daily. 

HORSERADISH. 

Raifort. 

The roots ot the horseradish are ex- 
tensively used as an appetizer on Creole 
tables. They are an agreeable relish, 
with a fine, sharp, pungent taste. 
Scraped and grated very fine, and set 
on the table in small cups, they are 
used as a condiment. In cookery the 
horseradish is used in the preparation 
of sauces and salads. 

KOHIiRABI, OR TURNIP-ROOTED 
CABBAGE. 

Chou-Navet. 
This vegetable is used in making soup 
purees or vegetable purees, and is also 
prepared in the same manner as cauli- 
flower. (See recipes Purees and also 
Cauliflower.) The finest variety, the 
"Early White Vienna," is the only va- 
riety planted and sold in New Orleans. 
It is an excellent table vegetable, very 
popular among the Italian and other 
European population of the city espe- 
cially, and very largely cultivated. 

I/EEKS. 

"Poireau. 
This popular vegetable is a species of 
onion, highly esteemed for flavoring 
soups, etc. It is used altogether as a 
seasoning. 

LBNTIIS. 

Des Lentilles. 

Lentils are among the most nutritious 
of all vegetables. They may be made 
into a puree (see recipe under chapter 
on Soups), or may be cooked In every 
manner in which red and white beans 
are cooked. On Fridays and fast days 
they are simply boiled over a slow 
fire, with a little butter, salt and pepper, 
and a bouquet of parsley, and an onion 
cut in quarters. Again, the Creoles boil 
Lentils with sausage, or Chaurice. Still 
again, they are simply boiled in salt and 
water, and served with a Sauce a la 
Vinaigrette, Sauce Soubise, or a Sauce 
a la .Maitre d'Hotel. (See redipes.) 

MUSHROOMS. 

Des Champignons. 

Mushrooms constitute one of the great- 
est flavoring vegetables known to the 
scientific cuisinier. They are used in all 
manner of sauces, and when veal, game 
or fish are cooked "en braise," or "en 
saute." They are used in "matelotes," 
and in nearly all forms of farcies. The 
Creoles, like the French, think it a crime 
to cook this vegetable in any form that 
would destroy its own peculiar flavor, or 
that which it is capable of imparting to 
the most ordinary dish. 

Stewed Mushrooms on Toast.

MUSTARD. 

De la Moutarde. 

Mustard Is grown extensively in Lou- 
isiana, especially the large-leaved or 
curled, which has grcwn to a distinct 
Louisiana variety, quite different from 
the European. The seed is black, and is 
raised in Louisiana, and the plant is be- 
ing more extensively cultivated every 
year. The large leaves are cooked the 
same as Spinach (see recipe), or they 
may be boiled with salt meat and served 
as greens. 

Our Creole mustard seeds are famous, 
not only in making sauces, but for 
medicinal purposes.

ONIONS. 

De rOgnon. 

Onions have always been conceded by 
the Creoles, as also by all scientists, 
among the healthiest of food substances. 
The onion is indispensable in the kitchen. 
It is used in almost every kind of meat 
and fish or vegetable seasoning, and im- 
parts a flavor that cannot be claimed by 
any other vegetable. Onions are also 
acknowledged as a great sedative. The 
onion juice, mixed with sugar, is largely 
used by the old Creoles in coughs and 
colds, and is almost an Infallible rem- 
edy. The onion is used as a salad, or It 
may be cooked in some very delightful 
ways. There are those who, being over- 
fastidious, object to eating onions on ac- 
count of the perceptible odor that clings 
to the breath, especially in eating the 
raw onion In salad. This should never 
Interfere in the consumption of a vegeta- 
ble that carries within it such important 



chemical juices that operate so' largely 
in the upbuilding of the general system. 
A glass of milk, taken after eating a raw 
onion, will destroy every particle of odor 
or taste that remains in the mouth. 

Boiled Onions. 

Ognons Bouillis. 

1 Dozen Nice, Small White Onions. 

1 Tablespoonful Butter. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

Throw the oniQns in their skins into 
cold water, and peel them. Then put 
them into a saucepan of boiling water. 
Add a teaspoonful of salt, and let them 
boil about forty minutes, or until you 
can pierce them easily with a fork. Then 
put into a dish, and drain off all water. 
Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste, 
and pour over a Drawn Butter Sauce 
(see Beurre a la Maitre d"Hotel), and 
serve hot. The large Spanish onions will 
require about an hour longer to boil ten- 
der. 

Creamed Onions. 

Ognons a la Creme. 

1 Dozen Small, White Onions. 

1 Tablespoonful Butter. 1 Tableaspoon- 

ful Flour. 

1-2 Pint of Milk or Cream. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

Boil the onions as directed in the above 
recipe. When very tender, take off the 
fire and drain. Pour over them the fol- 
lowing cream sauce, which you will have 
prepared when almost ready to serve: 
Put one tablespoonful of flour into a 
saucepan, and add a tablespoonful of 
butter. Set on the fire, an'd let all blend 
well together, rubbing very smooth, with- 
out browning. Then add half a pint of 
milk. Stir continually till it bolls. Sea- 
son with salt and pepper to taste, and 
pour over the onions, and serve hot. The 
young Creole onions are most delicious 
when prepared in this manner. 

Fried Onions. 

Ognons Frits. 

1-2 Dozen Nice, Tender Onions. 

1 Tablespoonful Butter. 1 Tablespoonful 

Salt. 

Pepper to Taste. 

Throw the onions Into cold water. Peel 
them, and cut them into thin slices. 
Cover tliem w.ith boiling water, and let 
them boil about twenty minutes. Drain 
off the water thoroughly, and put them 
into a frying pan with a large table- 
spoonful of butter, and season to taste 
and let them fry slowly for about ten 
minutes. Turn frequently, to prevent 
them from burning. Again, the onions 
may be fried without previous boiling, 
some preferring this latter method, as it 
admits of the onion retaining its flavor. 
Simply peel and pare and slice into 
round-shaped pieces. Lay the pieces in 
milk, and then in grated bread crumbs 
or flour, and fry them In boiling fat for 
about ten minutes. Lift them out of the 
fat, drain well, and serve on a hot dish 
with fried parsley as a garnish. Toung 
shallots may be fried by washing well in 
cold water, cutting off the rough roots 
of the shallots, and then cutting the 
green and white together Into half-Inch 
dice. Season well with salt and pepper, 
and fry in butter for aboiit five minutes. 
Garnish a dish with parsley sprigs. Lay 
the shallots on these and serve hot.

Smothered Onions. 

Ognons Sautes. 

1 Dozen Small Onions. 

1 Tablespoonful of Butter. 1 Quart of 

Broth. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

Put the onions into cold water, and 
remove their skins. Then put them into 
a saucepan, and cover with a soup stock 
<pot-au-feu or bouillon), if you have it, 
otherwise use water, and let them stew 
slowly for an hour and a half, till they 
are almost falling to pieces. Then drain 
the onions through a colander, and save 
the stock. Put a tablespoonful of butter 
into a frying pan, and add a tablespoon- 
ful of flour, and make a Brown Roux. 
(See recipe.) When brown, add a half 
pint of the broth in which the onions 
were boiled. Season well with salt and 
pepper and a dash of Cayenne. Put the 
onions into this and let them simmer 
gently for about twenty minutes longer. 
Serve hot.

1-2 Dozen Large Spanish Onions. 

A Stuffing of Chaurice. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

Take a half dozen fine, large St>anlsh 
onions, and put them in hot ashes to 
roast. When they are sufficiently cooked, 
which will be in about half an hour, 
take them out of the ashes, dust off and 
peel well. Then open the interiors and 
fill with a stuffing made as follows: 
Take a tablespoonful of butter and put 
in a frying pan, and add three Chaurice, 
which you will have taken out of the 
casings and chopped finely again. Add 
a cup of bread, which has been wet and 
squeezed, and mix well. Then add an 
Inch of ham, finely chopped, and a sprig 
each of thyme and parsley and sweet 
marjoram, and one bay leaf, all finely 
minced. Season with salt and pepper to 
taste. ITry about fifteen minutes, and 
then stuff the onions as far down in the 
center as possible, and between the folds. 
Sprinkle the top with powdered bread 
crumbs, and put a Ifttle dot of butter 
on top of each. Set in the oven and let 
tbem bake for about thirty or forty 
minutes. Serve with roast beef. 

Another nice way^ of stuffing onions 
is to . peel the onion^ scooi» out the cen- 
ters with a vegetable scoop, parboil them 
for ten minutes, and then fill the In- 
sides with the sausage forcemeat, as di- 
rected above. Line the bottom of a stew- 
pan with fine strips of bacon. Lay over 
these an onion and a carrot, both minced 
very fine. Place the onions on top of 
this and moisten with a pint of Chicken 
or Veal Consomme. Set in the oven to 
bake for about three-quarters of an hour 
and baste frequently. Serve in a hot 
dish, with fEte sauce poured over. 
Baked Onions. 
Ognons Rotis. 
1 D(teen Large Spanish Onions. 
Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

Trim the onions nicely, but do not peel 
them. Then put them into a kettle of 
boiling water, and let them boil rapidly 
for about an hour. Drain in a colander. 
Then put them in a baking pan, and let 
them bake slowly f(Jr about an hour. 
Take out and remove the skins, and place 
in a vegetable dish, and sprinkle with 
salt and pepper, and serve with Drawn 
Butter Sauce. (See Beurre a la Maitre 
d'Hotel.) 



After taking the onions out of the 
boiling water, if you wish to serve with 
"Roast Beef aux Ognons," peel the 
onions and place around the beef, roast 
in the oven. Baste them as often as you 
baste the roast, with the juices that come 
from it. Serve with the roast, using 
them as a garnish around the dish. 

Glazed Onions. 

Ognons Glaoes. 

1 1-2 Dozen SVnall Onions of Uniform 

Size. 

1 Tablespoonful Sugar. 1 Cup Water. 

i Large Teaspoonful Butter. 

Salt to Taste. 

Select small Creole onions of uniform 
size, top the heads and the stems, and 
remove the skins, but not too closely, 
lest they should break up when boiling. 
Then take a frying pan, large enough for 
the onions to lie in it, side by side. Put 
the butter in it first, and when melted 
add the onions. Then sprinkle with the 
sugar and water, and season with salt 
to taste. Set on the back of the stove, 
where they can simmer gelilly for an 
hour. When nearly done, and tender all 
through, add a tablespoonful of flour, 
mixed in water, blended well. Then set 
in the oven, with a paper on top. Let 
them stand for about half an hour, and 
use as a garnish for beef, veal, etc. The 
onions will be nicely glazed, and will 
make the dish appear very beautiful. 

SHALIOTS. 

Bchallottes. 
Shallots are small-sized onions, grown 
in clumps. They are very delicate and 
mild in flavor, and much used In soups, 
stews, salads, etc. In the green state 
they are also chopped and fried in butter. 
(See recipe Fried Onions.)

nishes, and gives a pretty touch to the 
homeliest dish. The "Plain-Leaved, the 
"Double Curled," or the "Beautiful Gar- 
nish" varieties are always to be found 
in the New Orleans market.

trim off all the coarse stems, wash in 
slightly salted water, drain and place in 
a colander. Set over a watertight ves- 
sel. Sliave some ice, cover the parsley 
with it and let it keep fresh and cool for 
table garnishes. Never lay parsley that 
Is intended for garnishing purposes in

PEAS. 

Des Pols Sees. 
All dried, split, kidney or black-eyed 
peas may be cooked in the same manner 
as beans. (See recipe.) 

GKFEN PBAS. 

Des Pols Verts. 

Green peas are abundant In our New 
Orleans market, with but a short respite, 
almost all the year. We have two crops, 
the spring and fall. The large peas, or 
older ones, are called "Des Pols Verts," 
and the smaller, or French peas, "Des 
Petits Pois." The latter are great deli- 
cacies when boiled and served with but- 
ter; the former may be utilized In mak- 
ing that most delectable dish, "Puree des 
Pols Verts." (See recipe In chapter on 
Soups.) 

To Cook Canned Green Peas. 

Petits Pois en Conserve. 
The delightful preparations of French 
peas that come put up Jn cans do not re- 
quire much cooking, being, like all 
canned vegetables, already cooked. To 
cook these drain the peas from all liquor 



149 



after opening the can, and put them in a 
saucepan; add a tablespoonful of butter 
and pepper and salt to taste. Set on the 
fire, and, when thoroughly heated, serve 
immediately. Green peas are served with 
all roast, and broiled and sauted meats, 
fowls or game. There is scarcely a vege- 
table that admits of such various uses 
with entrees. 

Boiled Green Peas. 

Petit Pois au Naturel. 

1 Pint of Fresh Young Green Peas. 
1 Tablespoonful of Butter. 
Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

Shell the peas, and when you have a 
pint (sufficient for six), put the peas into 
cold water, drain and put into a sauce- 
pan of boiling water; add a teaspoonful 
of salt, to prevent the peas from crack- 
ing, and let them boil rapidly for at 
least twenty minutes. To ascertain if 
they are done, take one out and press 
with a fork. The great art in cooking 
green peas properly is to have plenty of 
water, to cook the peas very rapidly, 
and not to let them boil a moment longer 
than necessary, if you would keep them 
from being soggy and preserve their 
fresh color and sweetness. Fresh peas 
should never be shelled until the moment 
when you wish to cook them. When 
cooked, they must be eaten immediately. 
As soon as done, drain off all water; 
put a large tablespoonful of butter Into 
the saucepan with the peas, season with 
pepper to taste, pour into a vegetable 
dish and serve hot. This Is the very 
nicest way of cooking this dainty vege- 
table. 

As the peas grow older and larger, they 
may be made into purees, or cooked as 
follows: 

Green Peas a la Bourgeois. 

Pois Vertis Sautes a la Bourgeoise. 

1 Pint of Peas. 

11-2 Tablespoonfuls of Butter. 

1 Ounce of Chopped Onion. 

1 Herb Bouquet, Minced Fine. 

1 Tablespoonful of Flour. 

1-2 Pint of Cream or Milk or W^ter. 

Shell and boil the peas according to 
the above recipe. Add sprigs of parsley, 
thyme and bay leaf, finely minced. When 
done, which will be in about forty min- 
utes, if the peas are large, or perhaps 
a few minutes longer (easily ascertained 
by taking out a pea and pressing it with 
a fork), drain off all water and add one 
tablespoonful and a half of butter. Then 
blend the flour, and add the milk, 
preferably, mixing together and stirring 
well, to prevent browning or burning. 
S'erve hot. Some add the yolk of an egg, 
well beaten, after taking the peas off the 
tire, but this is a matter of taste; the 
flavor of the peas is more perceptible 
without it.

them. Put them into a saucepan, with 
one tablespoonful of butter; add the 
herb bouquet, the onion whole, and the 
lettuce heart, and cover with cold water, 
and let them simmer slowly for about 
twenty minutes, or until tender. Then 
drain off the water, remove the onion 
and herb bouquet, lay the lettuce heart 
on a dish, and add another tablespoonful 
of butter to the peas. Let them cook for 
five minutes longer. Pour the peas over 
the lettuce heart and send to the table 
hot, and serve with chops or cutlets as a 
vegetable.

very recherche dish. Serve as an entree. 

POTATOES. 

De la Pomme de Terre. 

Potatoes may be cooked in a greater 
variety of ways than any other vege- 
table. They are most nutritious and are 
always economical as well as a palatable 
dish on the table. 

Steamed Potatoes. 
Pommes de Terre a la Vapeur. 

8 Nice Potatoes. 
A Pot of Boiling Water. Salt. 

Wash the potatoes well, scrubbing 
thoroughly, to take off every particle of 
earth that adheres. Then put them in a 
potato steamer, and set over a pot of 
boiling water. Cover tight and steam 
till you can pierce with a fork. Potatoes 
should never be boiled if you can steam 
them conveniently, as they are naturally 
watery. When done, remove the jackets, 
or skin, and sprinkle with salt and pep- 
per; add a tablespoonful of butter In 
which you have mingled chopped pars- 
ley; and serve immediately. Or they may 
be served just as they are, in a covered 
dish. A potato should atwarys be mealy, 
and not sogged with water, if cooked 
properly. In cooking potatoes the time 
depends on the size of 'the potato. An 
unfailing test is to cook till the potato 
can be easily pierced with a fork. 

Boiled Potatoes. 

Pommes de Terre au Naturel. 

6 Potatoes, of Uniform Size, if Possible. 

Boiling Water. 

Potatoes should always be boiled In 
their skins, or jackets, if possible. Never 
be guilty of paring a new potato before 
boiling. Towards the close of winter, 
Just before the new crop comes in, the 
potatoes may be pared, so that blemishes 
may be removed. But this is scarcely 
necessary in our state, unless the old no- 
tatoes have sprouted and shriveled. 

Wash and scrub the'iiotatoes well, and 
put them on in their jackets in a pot of 
boiling water, which has been well salt- 
ed. Let them cook until they are soft 
enough to be pierced with a fork. Do 
not let them remain a moment longer, 
or they will become waxy and watery. 
Nothing is more disagreeable than a wa- 
tery potato. When done, take them out 
and drain dry. Put into steamer, sprin- 
kle with salt, and cover and let them 
stand over the kettle (Hd open) on the 
fire for a few minutes fof the water to 
evaporate. After five minutes take off 
and peel quickly, and serve in a covered 
vegetable dish.

a tablespoonful of 'Snelted butter, in 
which you have mingled chopped parsley. 
Salt and pepper to taste. Potatoes pre- 
pared in this way are delicious. 

Or, if you wish to have mashed pota- 
toes, or a "Puree of Potatoes," as a vege- 
table, mash the potatoes well, and add 
two tablespoonfuls of butter. Salt and 
pepper to taste. Place in a dish, mold 
prettily, and serve hot with meals, fish, 
poultry, etc. A half cup of milk or cream 
may be added to the puree with very

potatoes. Mash the potatoes well, and 

put them into a frying pan with the 

butter. Add the yolks of 2 eggs well 

beaten and stir well, and almost add 

Immediately the cream. Let it get very

width. Roll first in a beaten egrg, to 
bind, and tlien in bread crumbs, and fry 
to a golden brown in boiling lard. (See 
general directions for frying.) When 
done, lift out of the lard with a skimmer, 
and drain on brown paper in the mouth 
of the loven. Serve for breakfast, or as a 
garnish for meats. Utilize left-over po- 
tatoes in this way. Serve with fish, 
fried, broiled or baked. 

Boulettes are prepared in exactly the 
same manner, only thyme and bay leaf, 
minced ver"*^ fine, are added, and the po- 
tatoes are formed Into balls, or boulettes. 
Boulettes are eaten more gejierally at 
breakfast, and croquettes at dinner, espe- 
cially with fislh.

open the oven slightly and take the po- 
tatoes out, one by one, in a cloth, and 
press lightly to see if they are quite 
soft to- the touch. Then either bring to 
the table in their Jackets, as many pre-

This is a delightful Creole variation 
for preparing potatoes. Select fine large 
potatoes, and have ready several nice 
Chaurice. Wash and peel the potatoes. 

Potatoes may also t)e stuffed after 
washing, by peeling carefully and scoop- 
ing out the insides nicely with a spoon 
or sharp-pointed knife. Then make a 
sausage forcemeat (see recipe), and heap 
up lightly on top. Butter a baking dish 
nicely, place the potatoes upon it, and 
let them bake in a slow oven for a half 
hour or forty-five minutes, till nicely 
browned, and send to the table hot.

and lay them in the pan with the beef 
or mutton or veal, and let them brown 
awhile before the meat is done, basting 
them when you baste the meat with the 
drippings from the roast. Place as a 
garnish around the roast, and bring to 
the table hot. 



SWEET POTATOES. 

Des Palates Douces. 

Sweet potatoes may be boiled, bak«d, 
fried or made into purees, and used In 
puddings and pies. The sweet potato is 
one of our most common vegetables. Pos- 
sessing saccharine properties, it is es- 
pecially nourishing and palatable. 

Boiled Sweet Potatoes. 

Patates Douces Bouillis. 

6 Potatoes. A Drawn, Butter Sauce. 

Wash the potatoes well, using a cloth 
or brush, and removing every particle of 
earth. Clip the edges of the roots that 
adhere. Put them to boil in a kettle of 
boiling water, and let them cook till 
they may be easily pierced with a fork. 
Then drain off the water, and set the 
kettle on the back of the stove. Cover 
and let the potatoes steam a few minutes. 
Take them out after five minutes or so, 
and peel and serve them with Drawn 
Butter Sauce, or cut in slices and spread 
butter over them, and set in the oven 
for a few seconds, and serve hot with 
daubes, fish, grillades, etc. Sweet pota- 
toes are in particular the vegetable that 
is served with roast pork. 

Fried Sweet Potatoes. 

Patates Do'uces Frites. 
4 Potatoes. 3 Tablespoonfuls of Butter. 

Cut the boiled potatoes lengthwise In 
slices. Fry in very hot butter until 
brown, and serve hot. This is a very 
nice way to utilize left-over potatoes. 

To fry uncooked potatoes, the great 
breakfast dish for fast days among the 
Creoles, slice the potatoes not length- 
wise, but by rounds, and fry in boiling 
lard. Bring to the table when a beauti- 
ful brown, and eat with butter, spread 
generously over. 

Sweet Potatoes an Caramel. 

Patates Douces au Caramel. 
4 Potatoes. Boiling Lard or Butter. 

4 Tablespoonfuls of Sugar. 
Boil the potatoes, and then cut them 
lengthwise in halves. Fry in boiling lard 
or butter, and, ■while frying, sprinkle 
generously with sugar. This is a de- 
licious sweet entree. 

Baked Sweet Potatoes. 

Patates Douces Roties. 

6 or 8 Potatoes. 1 Tablespoonful of 
Butter. 

Wash the potatoes, and scrub the skins, 
but do not peel them. By rubbing the 
skins of the potatoes lightly all over with 
a little lard, butter or fat bacon, it will 
render the skins soft and pliable to the 
touch when baked; they will peel read- 
ily, without crumbling from dryness, as 
baked potatoes often do, the peeling com- 
ing off in thin strips, leaving the potato 
intact. Put the potatoes in a baking pan 
in the oven, and let them took until their 
centers are mellow to the touch. Serve 
in their jackets immediately. Serve with 
roast meats, daubes, grillades, etc., or as 
a Friday dish, to be eaten with butter. 

To roast potatoes with meat or pork, 
wash and boil the potatoes well, and a 
half hour before the roast pork or beef 
is done pare the potatoes, drain well, and 
place in the baking pan, around the pork 
or beef, and baste frequently with the 
dripping from the roasting meat. Or put 
in the pan without boiling, and bake a 



154 



half hour longer'. The former is the best 
method. 

Sweet Potato Fritters. 

Patates Douces en Beignets. 

4 Boiled Sweet Potatoes. 

1 Glass of Milk, White Wine or Brandy. 

1 Teaspoonful of Sugar. 

Juice of Lemon. Powdered Sugar. 

Cut the boiled sweet potatoes into slen- 
der round slices, and steep them for a 
half hour in a little White wine or 
Brandy or milk. Then make a light bat- 
ter, to which you will have added a table- 
spoonful of sugar. Add the juice of a 
lemon to the soaking potatoes. Take 
each slice at a time, dip it in the batter, 
and let it drop from the spoon into the 
boiling lard. When fried to a nice golden 
brown place on a piece of brown paper, 
and drain in the oven. Then place in the 
dish in which they are to be served. 
Sprinkle with powedered white sugar, 
and serve hot as a sweet entremet.

Add finally, if desired, a wineglassful of 
good old Brandy or Whisky, and set 
the pan with the potatoes in an oven, 
and let it bake for an houh. Place a 
brown pa^er on top for the first three- 
quarters of an hour, and take it off at 
the last quarter for the frangipane to 
brown nicely. Sprinkle with powdered 
sugar, and serve hot or cold. 

Sweet Potato Waffles. 

Gaufres de Patates Douces. 

4 Left-Over Potatoes. 
Other Ingredients in Proportion Given. 

This is a good way to utilize left-over 
potatoes. To every two tablespoonfuls 
of mashed potatoes add one of butter, 
one of sugar, one pint of milk, and four 
tablespoonfuls of flour. Beat all well to- 
gether, and add one egg, well beaten.

about an hour. It may be served hot 
or cold cut in slices. It is delicious when 
served at luncheon cold with a glass of 
fresh milk. 

PEPPISrtS. 

Du Piments. 

More peppers are raised in Louisiana 
than in any other section of the country. 
The hot varieties, or "Pimentos," as the 
Creoles call them, "Chili," "Red Pepper," 
"Cayenne," "Tabasco," etc., are used ex- 
tensively for seasoning and for making 
our famous Creole pepper sauces. The 
mild varieties, "Sweet Peppers," or 
"Green Peppers," "Mangoes," etc., are 
highly esteemed, and are used not only 
in making salads, but in other delightful 
dishes. The Creoles are famous for the 
uses to which they have adapted all 
peppers. 

GREEN PEPPERS. 

Des Piments Verts. 

Green Peppers may be used in salads, 
as seasonings for various dishes, or they 
may be stuffed or sauted. For Green 
Pepper Salads see recipe under chapter 
on 'Salads." 

Stuffed Green Peppers. 
Piments Verts Farcis. 

2 Dozen Fresh Green Peppers. 

1 Tablespoonful of Butter. 

1-2 Onion, Chopped Very Fine. 

1-2 Inch of Boiled Ham. 1 Clove of 

Garlic. 

1-2 Cup of Bread, Wet and Squeezed 

Thoroughly. 

Parboil one dozen of the i>eppers. Then 
take off the skins and cut the topmost 
tip, and clean the inside of the peppers, 
throwing these seeds away. Then take a 
dozen or more raw pept^ers, cut off the 
stalk or stem, and clean the insides of 
all seeds, throwing the seeds away. Chop 
the peppers very fine, and then put a 
tablespoonful of butter on the fire. Add 
one-half of an onion, minced fine, and 
let it brown slightly in the butter. Then 
add the peppers, minced very fine, al- 
most mashed into a jelly, and the half 
inch of ham, minced very fine. As these 
brown add the clove of garlic, minced 
fine, and when the peppers are well 
cooked add one-half a cup of bread that 
has been wet in water and squeezed 
thoroughly. Season with salt and pepper 
to taste, and let it brown. Add a dash of 
Cayenne pepper. When the stuffing is 
well browned and well seasoned take 
from the stove and stuff the pepi)ers. 
Sprinkle a little grated bread crumbs 
on top, and a dot of butter on each pep- 
per top. Put it in the stove, let it brown, 
and serve hot with meats, broiled or 
roasted, chicken, etc. 

Green Pepi»ei'=i Saiit«d. 

Piments Verts Sautes. 

1 Do7en Large Green Peppers. 

1 Tablespoonful of Butter. 

2 Chopped Shallots. 2 Sprigs of Parsley. 

A Dash of Sweet Paprika. 

Salt to Taste. 

Plunge the peppers into hc-t boiling 
fat and rub off the' skin. Then cut them 
into halves and cut off the stem and 



155 



take out the seeds. Carefully out away 
the ribs and let the peppers saute for 
ten minutes in a tablespoonful of butter. 
Then moisten with a pint of consomme; 
season with the chopped shallots, parsley 
and sweet paprika, and let all cook slow- 
ly for a half hour, or until done. Pre- 
pare fancy slices of toast, and serve the 
peppers on these with a delicate garnish 
of chopped yolks of hard-boiled eggs. 

MANGOES. 

Mangos. 
This is a bright, waxy, golden-yellow 
sweet pepper, very brilliant and hand- 
some, and exempt from fiery flavor, and 
may be eaten as readily as an apple. 
Mangoes are generally served as an ap- 
petizer (hors d'oeuvres). 

PUMPKIN. 
Des Citrouilles — Des Giraumonts ou 

Potiron. 
We have two varieties of pumpkin In 
Louisiana, one a large, immense globa 
pumpkin, and the other a more delicate 
and much more highly appreciated va- 
riety, called the Cashaw. The former is 
called by the Creoles "Citrouille," and the 
latter "Giraumont," or "Potiron." Both 
are cooked according to the following 
methods: 

Stewed Pumpkin. 

Citrouille a la Creole 

2 Pints of Pumpkin or Cashaw. 

4 Tablespoonfuls of Butter. 

1 Teaspoonful of Salt. 

1 Teaspoonful of Ground Mace. 

1 Teaspoonful of Ground Cinnamon. 

1 Teaspoonful of Ground Cloves. 

2 Gills of Good Whisky or Brandy. 
Cut the pumpkin into halves and then 

into quarters, and pare. Then cut it 
into pieces of about one inch square. 
Place them all In a deep pot, and add 
sufficient water to cover. Let the pump- 
kin stew slowly for about an hour, stir- 
ring frequently to prevent burning. Then 
take out of the pot, press through a 
colander, and set back on the stove. Add, 
for every pint of pumpkin, two large 
tablespoonfuls of butter, and a half tea- 
spoonful of salt, one of ground mace, 
one of ground cinnamon and one of 
ground allspice. A gill of good Whisky 
or Brandy may be added, and improves 
the flavor. Mix all thoroughly, and add 
sugar to taste. Let it simmer slowly for 
half an hour longer, and serve hot with 
daubes, Grillades a la Sauce, etc. If the 
pumpkin cooks till very tender, so that 
it mashes easily, it need not be pressed 
through a colander. 

If the Citrouille, or large pumpkin, is 
used, never cook all in one day. Cut it 
In half, and save the other half for some 
other day in the week. The Cashaw will 
depend on the size Generally one Is 
cooked at a time. Left-over pumpkin 
can be utilized In making pumpkin pie. 
(See recipe.) 

Baked Pumpkin. 
Giraumont Rotl. 

2 Pints of Pumpkin or Cashaw. 
A Dressing of Butter or Gravy. 

Cut the pumpkin in halves and then 
into quarters. Two quarters are enough 
for a family of six, if the pumpkin Is 
large. Remove the seeds, but do not peel 
tbe rind. Place in a baking pan with 
the rind downwards, and bake until so 
tender that it may be pierced easily with 
a fork. Serve in the rind at the table, 
helping it by spoonfuls. It is eaten with 
butter or gravy. 



BADISSES. 

Des Radls. 
Radishes are eaten as a relish, or hors 
d'oeuvres. They are great appetizers, 
and help the digestion. 

There is an art in preparing the radish 
properly for the table. Cut the tops and 
save them for Gumbo aux Herbes. Throw 
the radishes into a bucket of cold water 
and wash well. Have at hand another 
bucket of water. Cut the remaining tops 
about an inch from the body of the 
radish, so that only the dainty green will 
appear. Hold the radish by the top root, 
upwards, and cut the skin downwards in 
tour or six parts, without detaching the 
radish from the stalk. In other words, 
open as you would an orange, without 
breaking to pieces. Throw "the radishes 
into the fresh bucket of cold water, and 
in about fifteen minutes they will have 
opened like a rose, and the effect of the 
white against the red is very pretty. Fill 
glass bowls with these, using taste in ar- 
ranging, and you will not only have a 
very dainty dish, as far as a relish is 
concerned, but a pretty table decoration. 
Another way is to scrape the radish 
in spots or lengths, alternating so that 
there will be a streak of red and one of 
white. The radish is not cut open In this 
case. Either way is pretty and inviting, 
if properly done. One or two dainty 
leaves may be left near the stalk to im- 
prove the appearance of the dish. 

Radishes may be served at breakfast, 
dinner or luncheon. The horseradish Is 
used as an appetizer, and also in sauces. 
BOQUEri'F. 
Roquette. 
This is a salad vegetable, resembling 
Cress in taste. It is served as a salad 
in the same manner, and is very popular 
with the Creoles. 

SAI.SIFr, OB OTSTEB PLANT. 
Salsifis. 
All recipes given for cooking parsnips 
may be applied to Salsify, which, by the 
way, is considered the most delicate of 
the two, both belonging to the same or- 
der. Salsify partakes somewhat of the 
flavor of oysters, hence the name "Oyster 
Plant." (See Parsnips.) 

Oyster Plant a la Creme. 
Salsifis a la Creme. 
A Bunch of Fresh Oyster Plant. 
1-2 Pint of Cream Sauce. 
Wash and scrape the roots of the plant 
thoroughly. Then throw them into cold 
water Immediately as you scrape them, 
or they will turn black and appear un- 
palatable. Have ready a kettle of boil- 
ing water, and cook for an hour, or 
longer, till tender. Drain and serve with 
a Cream Sauce poured over. (See recipe 
Cream Sauce.) 

Oyster Plant a la roulette. 

Salsifis a la Poulette. 

A Bunch of Salsify or Oyster Plant. 

1-2 Pint of Sauce a la Poulette. 
Prepare exactly as in the manner Indi- 
cated above, using instead of the Cream 
Sauce a Sauce a la Poulette. 

Oyster Plant Sauted In Butter. 

Salsifis Sautes au Beurre. 

A Good Bunch of Oyster Plant. 

4 Tablespoonfuls Of Vinegar. 

4 Tablespoonfuls of Flour. 

A Tablespoonful of Salt. 

The Juice of 1 L*mon. 

A Teaspoonful of Chopped Parsley. 

A Pinch of Black Pepper. 



156 



Scrape the oyster plant well and throw 
into cold water, into which put two ta- 
blesp'Oonfuls of vinegar to prevent the 
salsify from turning black. Take from 
the water, drain and cut into pieces one 
and a half inches in length. Put into 
a saucepan with two tablespoonfuls of 
vinegar and flour well mixed and cover 
with a quart of cold water. Add a table- 
spoonful of salt, cover well and let boil 
slowly for three-quarters of an hour. 
Drain and return to the saucepan and 
add two tablespoonfuls of the best but- 
ter, the pepper, chopped parsley, juice 
of a lemon, and a pinch of black pepper. 
Mix well and let it heat for five minutes, 
tossing almost constantly. Put into a 
deep dish and serve hot. 

Salsify Fritter. 

Salsifis en Beignets. 

A Bunch of Salsify. 

1 Tablespoonful of Butter. 

1 Cup of Water. 2 Eggs. 

1-4 Pound of Flour. 1 Teaspoonful of 

Salt. 

1 Teaspoonful of Pepper. 

Clean and scrape the salsify and boll 
as directed in recipe Boiled Parsnips (see 
recipe) till very tender. Then cut into 
long, narrow strips. .Make a batter by 
mixing the flour with the yolks of the 
eggs, beaten well. Then add the salt and 
pepper, and gradually one cup of water, 
till it is absorbed. Then add the whites 
of the eggs, beaten to a stiff froth. Mix 
thoroughly. Add the salsify to the bat- 
ter. Dip out one spoon at a time of the 
batter, and fry in boiling lard. Serve as 
an entree at dinner. 

SPINACH. 

Des Epinards. 

Spinach is one of the healthiest of vege- 
tables, but, unfortunately. It is generally 
so badly prepared by the majority of 
cooks as to be not only most unrelisha.- 
ble, but unsavory as well. The great art 
In cooking Spinach is to cook it just long 
enough and no longer, to drain thor- 
oughly and to have it of just such con- 
sistency as will enable it to retain a neat 
shape when arranged on a dish in mound 
shape. The most importaTit point in cook- 
ing Spinash is to drain it perfectly dry 
the moment it is taken from the fire. 
It allowed to cook too long, it loses Us 
color. If it stands In the water it be- 
comes tasteless. The following are the 
Creole methods of serving Spinach. It 
is one of the cheaipest of all dishes served 
among the Creoles, and a very go^od dish, 
too. 

Spinach, PIn.:n Bolted. 

Epinards au Nature!. 

1-2 Peck of Fresh Young Spinach. 

1 Cupful of Water. 1 Tablespoonful of 

Butter. 

Always select young and tender spin- 
ach. Carefully pick it over, and reject 
all wilted leaves and coarse fibers and 
nerves. Cut off the roots. W^ash and 
drain it well in cold water, and press 
out all the water. It will take about halt 
a peck, or four pints, to make a good 
dish, as it boils down. Put the spinach 
in a kettle, and add one cupful of water. 
Place on a moderate fire and let it utm- 
mer tor ten minutes. As soon as it ap- 
pears to wilt take oft the tire, for that 
is all the cooking that is needed. Then 
drain the spinach of all water through 
a colander, and then press through a 
^'ery fine sieve, to drain off the remain- 



ing water from the vegetable. Chop the 
spinach very fine. Then put a table- 
spoonful of butter in a saucepan, and 
add the spinach to it. Stir well. Add a 
few spoonfuls of water, just sufficient 
to thin, if a little thick, anfi let it heat 
thoroughly. Otherwise, if of the right 
consistency, no water need be added. 
Good judgment must here prevail. Season 
with salt and pepper to taste. 

At this point the spinach may be served 
in various ways, as Spinach a la Creme, 
Spinach au .Tus, Spinach with Hard- 
Bolled Eggs, Spinach a la Maitre d'Hotel, 
etc. The plain boiled spinach may be 
served with vinegar as a salad. (See re- 
cipe under chapter on Salads.) 

Spinach a la Creme. 

Epinards a la Creme. 

1-2 Peck of Spinach. 1 Cupful of Water. 
1 Tablespoonful of Butter. 1 Table- 
spoonful of Powdered Sugar. 
6 Croutons. 
A Cream Sauce. 

Prepare the spinach as above. When 
ready lo take from the saucepan, have 
ready slices of buttered toast, or Crou- 
tons fried in butter. Roll the Croutons 
in sugar before frying. Heap the spinach 
in little mounds upon them, sprinkle 
lightly with sugar, and pour over a 
Cream Sauce (see Cream Sauce), and 
serve hot. 

Spinach au Jns :* la Bourgeois^. 

Epinards au Jus a la Bourgeoise. 

1-2 Peck of St>lnach. 

2 Hard-Boiled or Poached Eggs. 

1 Cup of Gravy or Consomme. 

Boil the spinach according to the 
above recipe. When ready to take from 
the saucepan, after adding the butter and 
seasonings, put it in a saucepan and 
pour over a cup of roast beef gravy-* or 
consomme, let it cook for twenty minutes, 
and serve hot. 

Spinach With Hard-Bolled Eggi. 

Epinards aux Oeufs Durs. 

1-2 Peck of Spinach. 

1 Cupful of Water. 1 Tablespoonful ot 

Butter. 

3 Hard-Boiled Eggs. 

Boil the spinach and prepare to the 
point indicated in recipe for Spinach 
(Plain Boiled). Then take the spinach 
from the saucepan, and arrange In a 
mound on a dish, and garnish with slices 
of hard-boiled eggs. 

Spinach » la Mnltre d'Hotel. 

Epinards a la Maitre d'Hotel. 

1-2 Peck of Spinach. 1 Cupful of Water. 

1 Tablespoonful ot Butter. A Sauce 
a la Maitre d'Hotel. 

Prepare the spinch as directed in recipa 
Plain Boiled Spinach. Pour over a 
Sauce a la Maitre d'Hotel, cook a few 
minutes, and serve hot. 

Spinach a la Cuisinlere. 

Epinards a la Cuisinlere. 
1-2 Peck of Spinach. 1-2 Tablespoonful 

ot Butter. 

1 Tablespoonful ot Flour. 1 Cup of Milk. 

6 Toasted Croutons. 

Prepare the spinach as above, hash 
fine, and put in a saucepan with a table- 
spoonful of butter. Season with salt and 
pepper, add a tablespoonful of flour, 
mixed with a cup ot milk and a spoon 



157 



of melted butter, and serve with toasted 
dice Croutons on the spinach. 
BEET TOPS, RADISH TOPS, TUItNIP 
TOPS, ETC. 

Never throw away any beet, turnip or 
radish tops. They may all be coolced in 
the same manner as spinafih au jus, or 
they may be coolced with salt meat, and 
malte very good and healthy, dishes. The 
humble Creole families in New Orleans 
prepare turnip tops and beet tops in such 
a way that a king might not disdain what 
is commonly held as kitchen refuse. 

All these may be made Into nice purees. 
(See recipe for making Purees.) 

SOBBEIi. 

De I'Oseille. 

Sorrel is used for various purposes in 
the kitchen. It is made into soups and 
purees, served as a salad, or cooked in 
exactly the same manner as in the recipe 
for cooking spinach. (See recipes Spin- 
ach.) 

Puree of Sorrel. 

Puree d'Oseille. 

In preparing S'orrel after this recipe, 
make a puree, to be served as a vegeta- 
ble or as a soup. (See recipe.) A vege- 
table puree is, of course, of far denser 
consistency than a puree intended for 
soup. 

Sorrel au Gras. 

Oseille au Gras. 

Prepare the sorrel in exactly the same 
mianner as spinach, or "Epinards au 
Jus." (See recipe). Reject all fibrous 
portions. After you have scalded it, it 
is important to drain thoroughly. Then 
chop and press through a colander. 
Garnish nicely with Croutons fried in 
butter. 

Sorrel is very acid, and to those who 
do not like much acidity, this may be 
modified by mingling with equal parts of 
spinach or lettuce. 

Sorrel au Maigre. 

Oseille au Maigre. 
Prepare exactly as above, only, instead 
Tof using broth or gravy, add milk and 
the well-beaten yolks of two eggs. 

SQUASH. 

Courge. 

3 Young Squash. 2 Tablespoonfuls of 

Butter. 

Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

Cut the squash into quarters and pare 
and remove the seeds. Then cut into 
small squares of about an inch. "Wash 
in cold water, and then put into a por- 
celain-lined or agate saucepan, and half 
cover with water, for squash is a watery 
vegetable. Let it simmer gently for about 
twenty minutes or half an hour. Then 
drain through a colander, pressing gent- 
ly. Mash the squash very fine after 
draining, and return to the saucepan; 
Add two tablespoonfuls of butter, and 
salt and pepper to taste, and stir until 
thoroughly heated, and it begins to sim- 
mer gently. Do not cease stirring or it 
will burn. S'erve hot. 

TOMATOES. 
Des Tomates. 

Like the onion, tomatoes are among the 
indispensable adjuncts of good cooking, 
entering, as they do, so much into the 
good seasoning and delicate flavoring of 



various dishes. They are also excellent 
in salads. (See Salads.) Tomatoes, how- 
ever, form very dainty dishes, when 
cooked, and among tliese are the follow- 
ing: 

Stewed Tomatoes. 

Tomates Sautees. 

12 Tomatoes. 1 Tablespoonful of Butter. 

1 Teaspoonful of Sugar. 1 Onion. 
1-2 Cup of Bread Crumbs. 1 Inch of 

Ham. 

Salt and Pepper and Cayenne to Taste. 

1 Sprig Each of Thyme, Parsley and 

Bay, Leaf. 

Scald the tomatoes, and let the water 
remain over them about five minutes. 
Then peel the tomatoes, slipping the 
skins off easily, and cut them into small 
pieces. Put a tablespoonful of butter into 
a saucepan, and as it melts add the 
onion, which you will have chopped very 
fine. Let it brown, and add one inch of 
ham, chopped very fine. Then add the 
tomatoes, and let them brown, slowly 
adding in the meantime a half cup of 
dry bread crumbs. Let all simmer gently 
and add one sprig each of thyme, parsley 
and bay leaf. Stew gently for an hour 
longer, and serve hot. 

Broiled Tomatoes. 

Tomates Grillees. 

6 Tomatoes. 2 Tablespoonfuls of Butter. 

1 Tablespoonful of Chopped Parsley. 

The Juice of 1 Lemon. 

Take six tomatoes and cut them In 
halves on the cross. Do not peel. Put 
them on the broiler and broil on a slow 
fire till tender. Turn the broiler from 
one side to the other often, to prevent 
burning. In about ten minutes they will 
be done. Put on a hot dish; put a little 
melted butter, a little chopped parsley 
and the juice of a lemon on each, and 
serve hot. 

Fried Tomatoes. 

Tomates Frites. 

6 Nice, Large, Firm Tomatoes. 

1 Egg. 1-2 Cup of Bread Crumbs. 
2 Tablespoonfuls of Lard. 

Slice the tomatoes very thin, and then 
dust with salt and pepper. Beat the egg 
very light. Dip the tomatoes first in 
this and then in the bread crumbs, and 
drop into the lard, covering the bottom 
of the pan. When brown on 'one side, 
turn on the other. Turn carefully with 
the cake turner into a heated dish. Keep 
warm while you are frying the rest, and 
serve very hot. 

Tomatoes au Gratin. 

Tomates au Gratin. 

6 Tomatoes. 2 Tablespoonfuls of Butter. 

1 Cup of Grated Bread Crumbs.

Scald and skin the tomatoes. Then 
place a layer of them at the bottom of 
a baking dish, cover with a layer of 
bread crumbs, spread very thick, and 
season with salt and pepper and dots 
of butter at intervals. Continue in this 
way till the last Jayer is reached, finish- 
ing with a layer of bread crumbs, 
sprinkle with, salt and pepper, dot with 
butter, and put in an oven to bake for 
an hour and a quarter. (I!anned toma- 
toes will require about half this time.

cut one slice from the stem end. Scoop 
out the inside of the tomaio, and put it 
In a dish and save the skins. Take one 
onion and one quarter of an inch of ham 
and chop very fine. Put a tablespoonful 
of butter into a saucepan, and add the 
onion, letting it brown nicely. Then add 
the ham. Let it brown. Add the insides 
of the tomatoes, and then add, almost 
instantly, a cup of bread that has been 
wet and squeezed. Beat all well together 
as it fries, and add salt and pepper to 
taste. Let it cook well, and then take 
off, and stuff the tomatoes, cut in halves 
or whole. The former is the daintier 
way. Sprinkle the tops with bread crumbs 
and dot with butter. Place in the oven 
for fifteen or twenty minutes, till brown, 
and serve hot with filet of beef or 
chicken, etc.

chopped onion, and let it brown. After 
a few minutes add the ham and chicken, 
and let these brown. Then add the to- 
matoes, and, as they brown, the bread 
crumbs. Add the minced herbs and a 
clove of garlic, if desired. (The garlic 
must be added before the tomatoes, if it 
be used.) Let all simmer gently. Season 
to taste with salt and pepper and a dash 
of Cayenne When well cooked, remove 
from the fire, when about the consistency 
of thick starch. Let it cool slightly, and

TURNIPS. 

Des Navets. 

Turnips are largely used, like the to- 
mato and onion, though not to such an 
extent, in seasoning food substances. 
They are indispensable with the pot-au- 
feu, the bouillon, or the well-made con- 
somme. 



Mashed Xurnti<s, 
Puree de Navets. 



6 Turnips. 2 Tablespoonfuls of Butter 
Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

Wash and pare the turnips, and cut 
them into quarters, and cover with boll- 
mg water and boil until very tender 
which will be in about thirty to forty- 
five minutes, according to the tenderness 
of the turnips. If you boil them whole It 
will take an hour and a quarter. If you 
cut the turnips as soon as tender take 
out of the water and drain through a 
colander of all water. Then press them 
lightly, to squeeze all remaining water 
out, and hash well. Add a tablespoonful 
of butter, salt and pepper to taste, and 
serve hot. 

Turnips may be mixed with equal 
quantities of potatoes, mashed and but- 
tered. 

Plain Boilel Turnliis. 

Navets Bouillis au Naturel. 

6 Turnii>s. A Drawn Butter Sauce. 

Boil the turnips whole, selecting very 
tender ones. They will require about -an 
hour of boiling. Always use hot water 
in putting on the turnips. Drain off 
water, when tender, and serve with a 
Drawn Butter Sauce, pepper and salt. 
Serve with roast beef, mutton or roast 
duck. 

Creamed Turnliis. 

Navets a la Creme. 
6 Turnips. A Cream Sauce. 
Cut large turnips in quarters for this 
dish. Small ones may be boiled whole. 
When tender, drain and put into a colan- 
der and press out all water. Then make 
a rich Cream Sauce (see recipe) and pour 
over the turnips. Serve with boiled leg 
of mutton, either by placing the turnips 
around the leg of mutton on the dish 
and pouring the sauce over, or separate, 
as a vegetable. 

Turnips Baked With Mutton. 

Mouton Roti aux Navets. 

6 Turnips. Salt and Pepper to Taste. 
Roast Mutton Drippings. 

Boil the turnips until nearly tender. 
Then drain in a colander. If very large, 
cut in quarters; if small, let them re- 
main uncut. Lay them on the pan, around 
the roasting leg of mutton, and let them 
bake about an hour, basting frequently 
with the drippings from the mutton. 
When done, place around the leg of 
mutton as a garnish, and serve. 

O lazed Turnips. 

Navets Glaces. 

6 Turnips of Uniform Size. 

1 Tablespoonful of Sugar. 1 Cup of 

Water.

Salt to Taste. 

Select fine, small and tender turnips 
of uniform size, top the heads and the 
stems, and remove the skins, but not too 



159 



closely, lest they should break up when 
boiling. Then take a trying pan large 
enough for the turnips to lie in It, side 
by side. Put the butter in first, and 
when melted add the turnips. Then 
sprinkle with the sugar and water, and 
season with salt to taste. Set on the 
back of the stove, where they can sim- 
mer gently for an hour. When nearly 
done, and tender all through, add a table- 
spoonful of flour, mixed in water, blend- 
ed well. Then set in the oven, with a 
paper on top. Let them stand for about 
half an hour and use as a garnish for 
beef, veal, etc. The turnips will be nice- 
ly glazed, and will make the dish ap- 
pear very beautiful. 

Turnips fried Iji Butter. 

Navets Sautes au Beurre. 

6 Turnips. 2 Tablespoonfuls of Butter. 
Salt and Pepper to Taste. 

Boil the turnips according to direc- 
tions, and, when very tender, drain in a 
colander. Put two tablespoonfuls of but- 
ter into a frying pan, and when it is 
hot add the turnips. ■ Season well with 
salt and pepper, ana, wnen nicely 
browned, dish on a hot platter and serve

1 Tablespoonful of Salt and a Pound of 

Fresh Pork or 1 Pound of Salt Pork. 

Pepper to Taste. 

Wash the turnip tops, and put into a 
kStle of boiling water with a piece of 
fresh or salt pork. Let them boil slowly 
till tender, and then season well with 
salt and pepper. When tender, take out 
and chop, but not too fine, or leave them 
just as they are. Drain of all water, 
and serve as you would boiled cabbage, 
piling: the turnip tops around the dish, 
and the salt meat or pork in the center. 

Again, the Creoles boil the white tur- 
nips with the greens, cutting the former 
portions into quarters or semi-quarters, 
according to their size, and chopping the 
greens after cooking. Eat with pepper 
vinegar, as you -would boiled cabbage. 

TBTTFirl^US. 

Des Truffes. 

The Truffle is a most expensive vegeta- 
ble. It belongs to the family of Mush- 
rooms, and is a subterranep,n production, 
of a fishy, fungous structure and round- 
ish figure. Its aroma is particularly 
niarked, and it is much esteemed by epi- 
cures, for, when mixed in proper pro- 
portions, it adds a zest and flavor to all 
sauces for Fish, Filets of Beef, Turkey, 
Chicken, Game and Omelets that cannot 
be found in any other plant in the enk- 
tire vegetable kingdom. The name 
"Truffle" is supposed to bs derived from 
the French "Truffe," or the Spanish 
"Trufa," signifying' deceit or imposition, 
the growth of the plant underground 
seeming to accord with the name. 

Truffles come prepared in cans, being 
put up in France, those of "Perigord" 
being the brand most in use; The Cre- 
oles use Truffles mostly as a condiment 
for fish, meats, stuffings for poultry, 
game, etc. They are very expensive, cost- 
ing as much as $3 a can, and a small 
can at that. In cooking filets, they are 
prepared simply "Truffee." or whole or 
cut in halves, or "a la Perigueux," that 
is, the Truffles are cut or minced very 
fine. They are also served after the 



following manner as entremets or hors 
d'oeuvres; 

Truffles in Sp<inii*li Style. 

Truffes a I'Espagnole. 

10 Truffles. 

2 Tablespoonfuls of Salad Oil or Butter. 

1 Tablespoonful of Minced Parsley. 

3 Finely Minced Shallots. 

3 Sprigs of Minced Parsley. 

1-2 Glass of White Wine. Sauce Espag- 

nole. 

Slice the Truffles very fine, and place 
in a saucepan on a slow fire, with a ta- 
blespoonful of butter or two of oil, salt 
and pepper to taste, and the minced pars- 
ley and shallots. After letting them 
smother for a few minutes, moisten well 
with the White wine or Champagne and 
a Sauce Espagnole, using equal propor- 
tions of the wine and sauce. Quicken 
the fire slightly, and let them cook slow- 
ly till done. Skim off all grease, and 
serve hot with ragouts, etc. 

Truffles With Olia^iiriasnc. 

Truffes au Vin de Champagne. 

6 Truffles. 1 Glass of Champagne. 

Make a "Marinade," that is a liquor 
with spices and vinegar; set to cook, and 
add a glass of Champagne. Add the 
Truffles, and season again to taste. Let 
all cook for .upwards of half an hour. 
Then take the Truffles from the sauce. 
Let them cool, and serve on a folded 
napkin as an hors d'oeuvre. 

Truffles on Minced Toast. 

Truffes en Croustades. 

4 Truffles. 2 Tablespoonfuls of Butter 
1 Clove of Garlic. 

Prepare the Truffles as in the recipe 
"a I'Espagnole," or simply "a la Proven- 
cale," that is, slice them very fine, let 
them stew or saute them in butter, and 
season well with salt and pepper and 
the clove of a garlic minced very fine. 
When dofte, add the juice of a lemon. 
Take some slices of bread, cut in fancy 
shapes, and fry in butter, or toast. Cover 
each piece with some of the Ragout of 
Truffles, and serve hot. 

VEGETABLE PEAR. 

,,, Mirliton. 

The Vegetable Pear, or "Mirliton," as 
the Creoles have named this vegetable, 
belongs to the gourd family. It is known 
to botanists by the name of the "One- 
Seeded Cucumber." Like almost all the 
gourds, the plant is a vine, and is trained 
by the Creoles upon trellis, fences or 
arbors around their homes. It is not 
only a very ornamental vine, but an 
abundant bearer. The fruit, if properly 
prepared, as the Creoles know so well 
how to prepare it, is a delightful dish, 
and is of a very viuch finer flavor than 
eggplants, squcishes or pumpkins. It may 
be cooked in a half dozen ways, stuffed 
and stewed and fried, as the eggplant 
(see recipes), or stewed or oaked, like the 
pumpkin, squash or cashaw. It is par- 
ticularly fine when prepared like stewed 
cashaw. (See recipe.) It may also be 
made into fritters, like eggplants, or 
baked cakes. In any way that it is 
served it is delicious, and is a great 
favorite with the Creoles, especially tha 
little children.

MELONS. 

T>es Melons. 

The New Orleans market cannot be ex- 
cellecl by any market in the world in the 
splendor and variety of the Melons found 
in the beginning of the summer, and till 
late in the fall, in its great market stalls 
and fruit stalls, which intersect every 
portion of the city. Especially is this 
the case with the .Muskmelon or Canta- 
loup. No Northern variety of melons 
can compare with our special varieties, 
and it is familiarly said that it requires 
Louisiana sun to bring the seed to per- 
fection. Muskmelons and "Watermelons 
are among our most common articles of 
food, and are within the reach of all 
classes, rich and poor, white and black, 
in season. The Creoles serve Melons both 
as a fruit and a dessert. 

MUSKMELON. 

Cantaloup. 

Muskmelons, or Cantaloups, are cul- 
tivated extensively in the vjcmity of New 
Orleans. The quality is fine, and the 
flavor delicious. They are served by the 
Creoles both as a fruit and as a dessert — 
as a fruit at the beginning of breakfast, 
and as a dessert at the close of luncheon 
or dinner. The melon is always served 
very cold, being kept on ice several hours 
before serving, and when cut in halves 
and cleansed of seed, crushed ice is 
placed within each half, and it is brought 
to the table and served. It is a most re- 
freshing accompaniment to breakfast, at 
which meal it is more generally served. 

WATERMELON. 

Melon d'Eau. 

The "Watermelon is as great a favorite 
among the Creoles for luncheon and din- 
ner and supper desserts as the Musk- 
melon is a general breakfast and lunch- 
eon favorite. Indeed, at all hours during 
the summer, except in the early forenoon, 
a watermelon is considered in place as a 
mO'st refreshing and welcome summer 
offering. "Watermelons are kept on ice 
continually by fruit dealers, and when- 
ever a family chooses to have a "Melon 
on ice" they have simply to send to the 
fruit stand, within a radius of a square, 
and a splendid rosv-fruited melon is to 
be had, cold and delicious, and just ready 
to be c"t. The Creoles, as a rule, cut 
the melon in great round slices, so that 



each person may have a piece of "the 
heart" of the fruit ; or it may be cut 
in lengthwise slices, according to taste. 
The new-fangled practice of "scooping 
the melon out with a spoon," and thus 
serving it, is disregarded by the Creoles. 
The only proper way to eat a melon and 
enjoy it is in the good old Creole style: 
Give every guest a fine round slice, glow- 
ing with "a heart of red," and thus will 
the fruit be enjoyed as it deserves. 
GARDEN HERBS. 

The old-time garden herbs are part of 
every well-regulated Creole kitchen gar- 
den. Thyme, Sage, Rosemary, Mint, 
Sweet Marjoram, Basil, Lavender, Anise, 
Carraway, Bene, Borage, Catnip, Corian- 
der, Dill, Fennel, Horehound, Pot Mari- 
gC'ld, Pennyroyal, Rue, Summer Savory, 
Tansy, Tarragon, "Wormwood — all these 
thrive in our gardens, ana are used by 
the Creole housewives, some for culinary, 
others for medicinal purposes. "The 
Bouquet Garni," or herb bouquet, has 
already been spoken of in the beginning 
of this book. To prepare such herbs as 
Sage, Thyme, Summer Savory, Mint, 
Basil, or any of the sweet or medicinal 
herbs, for winter usft, the Creole house- 
wife gathers them from her own little 
garden patch when they are fresh in 
their season, or she procures them from 
the markets. After examining them well, 
and discarding all poor or sickly-looking 
sprigs, she washes and shakes the herbs. 
Then she ties them into small bundles, 
and ties an old piece of mosquito netting 
about them, to keep them from picking 
up any dust. The herbs are then hung, 
leaves downwards, in a warm, dry place. 
In a few days they will be thoroughly 
dry and brittle, ^e then picks all the 
leaves off, and puts them in clean, large- 
mouthed bottles, and corks and labels 
them. "When needed for use, they are 
rubbed very fine between the fingers and 
passed through a sieve. The bottle is al- 
ways kept corked, as exposure to the air 
will cause the herbs to lose strength and 
flavor. 

Herbs, such as Pweet Marjoram, 
Thyme, etc., are in daily use in our 
kitchens. In like manner the Creole 
housewife gathers the leaves of the 
Laurel, or Bay Leaf, and. after washing 
and drying thoroughly, the leaves are 
bottled for use. But fresh herbs are 
nearly always to be found in our gar- 
dens. 



CHAPTER XXX. 
RELISHES. 

Hors d'Oeuvres. 



Hors d'Oeuvres are relishes and may 
be served either hot or cold. Ordinarily, 
!n dally household life, only the cold 
hors d'oeuvres, such as cress, celery, 
olives, radishes, etc, are served; they are 
set upon the tables as a decoration and 
passed as appetizers or relishes between 
the courses. At more formal affairs, hot 
hors d'oeuvres are served, some of them 
being most elegant and recherche dish- 
es. The hot hors d'oeuvre does not 
preclude the cold at the same dining.

Almost all of the above named Hors 
d'Oeuvres, whether hot or cold, have been 
already treated in the special depart- 
ments, whether of vegetables or meat&i 
to which they pertain. The subjoined 
recipes, however, have been especially 
prepared, the number and variety of our 
Creole Hors d'Oeuvres being such as to 
warrant a special chapter on the sub- 
ject.

CHAPTER XXXI. 
SWEET ENTREMETS. 

Des Entremets Sucres. 



ffweet entrees and entremets are not 
the least part of the real Creole cuisine. 
The ancient French colonists brought the 
custom of serving sweet entremets and 
entrees, such as Beignets, Compotes, Souf- 
fles, Gelees, etc., from the old mother 
country to Louisiana. The Creoles ap- 
plied these , to the various delightful and 
refreshing fruits which abound in Lou- 
isiana. When the little Creole children, 
taking a peep into the kitchen, as chil- 
dren will do in every clime, saw that the 
fat and cheery old negro cook was going 
to make Apple Fritters, Orange Fritters 
or cook fried bananas for dinner, there 
was always some very endearing term 
applied to the old Creole cuisiniere, and 
she never failed to respond in the whole- 
some and practical way that the Creole 
cooks of those days did, by handing « 
beautiful golden beignet. piled with 
snowy sugar, to the expected little ones. 



FRITTERS. 



Des Beignets. 

The most important rule to be observed 
in making fritters, whether of fruit or 
plain, is to have the batter of the proper 
consistency. This is particularly impor- 
tant in making fruit fritters. "La Pates 
a Beignets," as the Creoles call the bat- 
ter, must be of sufficient consistency to 
envelop in one single immersion the fruit 
or other substance with which it is in- 
tended to make the fritters. 

Fritter Batter a la Creole. 

Pate a. Beignets a la Creole. 

1 Cup Flour. 2 Eggs. 2 Tablespoonfuls 

Brandy. 

1-4 Teaspoonful of Salt. 

Cold Water. 1 Tablespoonful Butter, 

Melted. 



164 



Beat the yolks of -the eggs well, and 
add the flour, beating very Ughf. Now 
add the melted butter and the Brandy, 
and thin with water to the consistency 
of a very thick starch. Add the whites 
of eggs, beaten to a stiff froth, and then 
dip the fruit into this, immersing well at 
one dipping. Lift out with a large cook- 
ing spoon, drop into the boiling lard, and 
fry to a golden brown. The batter must 
be thick enough to coat the fruit all 
around in one immersion, yet it must not 
be so thick as to be over-heavily coated 
or tough. 

Many of the Creoles substitute, accord- 
ing to the fruit which they intend to 
make into fritters. White wine or Sherry 
or lemon juice for the Brandy. A fruit 
fritter must always be sprinkled nicely 
and lightly with powdered sugar, and, 
if served as an entremet, it must be hot. 
Fruit fritters often take the place of des- 
serts among the poorer Creole families. 

French Fritter Batter. 

Pate a Beignets a la Francaise. 

1 Cup of Sifted Flour. 1-2 Cup of Cold 

Water. 

2 Eggs. 1-2 Cup of Sugar. 

1 Tablespoonful of Best Olive Oil. 

2 Tablespoonfuls of Brandy or Orange 

Flower Water. 
1-4 Teaspoonful of Salt. 
Beat the whites well into a stiff froth. 
Beat the yolks of the eggs into the flour 
until very light, and add the sugar, 
blending well. Add Brandy or orange 
(lower water, and beat light, and then 
add the water and oil, making the batter 
of the consistency of a very thick starch. 
Now add the whites of the egg, beat 
well, and proceed to drop in the fruit, 
as in above recipe. 

Plain Fritters. 
Beignets de Pate. 

1 Pint of Flour. 1 Pint of Milk. 
1 Teaspoonful of Baking Powder. 
4 Eggs. 
The Zest of Half a Ijemon. 
1-4 Cup of Sugar. Flavoring to Taste. 
1-2 Teaspoonful of Salt. 
Beat the yolks of the eggs and the 
whites separate. Sift the baking pow- 
der into the flour, and add the yolks 
of the eggs, well beaten. Beat well, and 
add the milk, and flavoring of orange, 
vanilla or Brandy to taste. (The flavor- 
ing may be omitted altogether.) Add the 
zest of a lemon, grated very fine, and 
salt in quantity given above. Lastly, 
add the whites, beaten to a stiff froth, 
and have the batter of such consistency 
that it will pour from the spoon. Drop 
it in the boiling lard by large kitchen 
spoonfuls, and let it fry to a golden yel- 
low. (See General Directions tor Fry- 
ing.) Lift out with a skimmer, and 
drain and place on a heated dish, and 
sprinkle freely with powdered white 
sugar, and serve hot. In arranging them 
in the dish make the fritters rise into a 
pretty pyramid and sprinkle with the 
sugar. Never pierce fritters with a fork, 
as it will cause the steam to evaporate 
and make the fritters heavy. A fritter 
that is well made should be light and 
puffy-

try, Etc. 

Pate a Beignets pour les Viandes, les

ter and the salt. Then add the water, 
and beat well, and finally add the whites 
of the eggs, beaten to a stiff froth. 
Some add a half teaspoonful of baking 
powder. This is according to taste. If 
the eggs are well beaten, there will be no 
need for the baking powder.

recommended. Soak them in Brandy or 
" good Whisky, or Rum, for the space of 
two hours, sprinkling with the grated 
zest of a lemon and sugar, according to 
judgment. Two tablespoonfuls of sugar

Creole and have ready a deep saucepan 
of boiling lard. Drain the apples. Dip 
the slices, one at a time, into the batter, 
lift out with a large kitchen spoon, drop

DOUGHNUTS. 

Croxignolles. 

1-2 Cup Sugar. 1 Pint of Milk. 3 Eggs 

2 Tablespoonfuls of Butter. 

1-2 Cake of Compressed Yeast. 

1 Teaspoonful of Salt. 

Flour in Sufficient Quantity to Make a 

Dough. 

Scald the milk, and then add the but- 
ter, and let it stand and cool. When it 
has cooled, add the yeast and the sugar, 
and beat in the flour gradually. Beat 
well, and then cover, and set the mix- 
ture in a warm place over night. But be 
careful to have the warmth only mod- 
erate. In the morning beat the eggs till 
very light, and stir them into the butter. 
Then add more flour, sufficient to make 
a dough, which must be soft. Knead 
this dough lightly, and stand it away 
to rise. When it has risen well take one- 
half of the dough and roll it on the 
biscuit board, and then cut into dough- 
nuts, using a large cake or biscuit cut- 
ter. Then take a small cutter and make 
a small hole in the center of each dough- 
nut. They may also be cut into square 
shar)e, and slashed gently with the cutter 
or knife. Spread a clean towel over IJie 
table, and dust it lightly with flour, and 
let the doughnuts stand upon it for half 
an hour, being well covered, either with 
a towel or some other cover. Let the 
frying kettle then be ready, with boiling 
fat or lard. It must be so deep that the 
doughnuts can swim in it. Put the dough- 
nuts into the boiling lard, and let them 
fry to a golden brown. Do not stick the 
doughnut through with a fork, or it will 
fall immediately. "V^^hen a beautiful dark 
golden brown drain out of the pan with 
a skimmer, place on a hot dish, sprinkle 
with powdered sugar, and serve hot. You 
will have the true (Creole "CroxIgnoUe." 

PANCAKES. 

Crepes. 

8 Eggs. 3-4 Pound of Sugar. 

1 Cup of Milk. 

1-4 Teaspoonful of Salt. 

Beat the yolks and whites of the eggs 
together. Then add the flour, and beat 
very light. Add the milk, pouring grad- 
ually, and having the batter no thicker 
than cream. Add the salt, and mix well. 
Now comes the most important part, the 
baking. Unless this is properly done your 
labor has fallen to naught. Have a wide 
pancake pan, and let it be very hot 
Grease it with butter, or. better still, with 
a piece of fat bacon. This is the safest 
way, as you will not have a pancake 
swimming in grease, a most undesirable 
offering at anv table. Pour in batter 
sufficient to just cover the bottom of the 
pan. In a minute, or perhaps less time, 
the cake must be ready to turn This is 
the critical moment that the old Creole 
cooks used to understand so well. By a 
peculiar sleight of hand that comes only 
by experience, the cake was tossed and 
caught in the pan, and the brown side 



169 



was brought up without failure, and the 
cake lay just as smooth as thO'Ugh un- 
touched. Those who wish to learn the 
art must begin slowly at first. If you 
have never tossed a pancake, and at- 
tempt to do It before you have caught 
the trick, as the old Creoles used to call 
it, you will make a miserable failure, and 
have only a mingled heap of batter. Go 
slowly, and learn. The old darkies used 
to say, when one of their number could 
toss a "crepe" to the top of the chim- 
ney and bring it down again slick and 
smooth, with the brown side up, tossing 
minute after minute, "like lightning," 
that the woman was "for sure one hoo- 
doo, and the old devil himself had taught 
her to toss and fry." But the pancakes 
thus tossed savored neither of fire nor 
brimstone, and, when rolled up with in- 
finite art and ready to serve hot on a 
dainty china dish, many were the en- 
comiums that masters and mistresses be- 
stowed upon their faithful old slaves. 
■ Crepes" may be served as an entree at 
breakfast, dinner or supper. They make 
an excellent luncheon dish. 

French Pancakes. 

Crepes a la Francaise. 

8-4 Pound of Flour. 4 Eggs. 

1-2 Pint of Cold Milk. 
4 Ounces of Powdered Sugar. 

Sift the flour into a bowl. Break in 
the eggs; beat well, and add one ounce 



of powdered sugar. Mix thoroughlv with 
a spatula, and then add the cold milk* 
pouring it in gradually. Mix well for six 
minutes. Have ready a clean griddle; 
butter lightly, and, when hot, drop on it 
about two large spoonfuls of the batter 
at a time. Let the cakes bake two min- 
utes on each side, and then turn and 
bake two minutes on the other. Turn 
the pancake on a dish ; sprinkle gener- 
ously with powdered sugar. Continue 
baking the cakes and turning on the dish, 
sprinkling each in turn with the pow- 
dered sugar till all is used. The above 
quantity of batter will make one dozen 
pancakes. 

French Pancakes With Jelly. 

Crepes Francaise a la Gele. 

3-4 Pound of Flour. 4 Eggs. 
1-2 Pint of Cold Milk. • 
4 Ounces of Powdered Sugar. 
1 Glass of Jelly. 

Prepare the batter exactly as in the 
above recipe. "When the pancakes are 
nicely cooked arrange them neatly on a 
dish, and spread over each a half table- 
spoonful of apple, strawberry, raspberry, 
currant, peach or any kind of jelly de- 
sired; then ro'll them up nicely and dress 
on a dessert dish and sprinkle powdered 
white sugar over them. Send to the ta- 
ble hot. Some glaze the surface of each 
pancake with a red hot iron. But this is 
a matter of taste and decoration. 



CHAPTER XXXII. 
DESSERTS. 

Des Desserts. 



Desserts are many and varied. They 
comprise Compotes, Puddings, Pies and 
Pastry, Cakes, Ices, Creams, etc., all of 
which are specially treated in order. Thb 
Creoles are famous for their dainty and 
delightful desserts. 

COMPOTES. 
Des Compotes. 

Compotes are fruits preserved in very 
little suger, and made as needed in 
the household. The fruits are always 
blanched, and a little sugar is added for 
them to absorb, and then they are put 
into dishes, and the syrup is poured over 
them. The Creoles often cut the fruits 
into many pretty shapes, especially 
apples and peaches. It is always better 
to blanch the fruits in thinned syrup 
than in water. To preserve the white- 
ness of the peeled fruits, they should be 
peeled as rapidly as possible, and put 
Into the saucepan with the water or 
syrups and blanched only long enough 
to soften, and then arranged In the dish 
and covered with the syrup. If the 
fruits are not ripe, they ought to be put- 
into syrup over the fire to cook a little. 

All Compotes may be served as des- 
serts or entrements. 

Gompote of Apples, 

Compote de Pommes. 

1 Dozen Apples. 1 Pound of Sugar. 

1-2 Cup of Water. 

Pare the apples, cut them in quarters, 
cut out the cores, and pierce them sev- 
eral times, to drain the juice. Boil six 
apples in one pound of sugar and half 
a cup of water, and add the finely cut 
peel of a lemon, together with the lemon 
juice. When they are well blanched, 
take them out, without letting them cook 
too much, and place them in a dish. 



They must be soft, but not pithy. Put 
the apples that you have cut into quar- 
ters into the syrup, and let them boil 
to a jelly in the juice. Then drain 
well, and pour over the apples. Sprin- 
kle with a little grated nutmeg and 
powdered sugar. This is excellent. 

To make a compote of whole apples, 
first remove the core its whole length, 
by inserting a long tin cutter at one 
end, and then at the other end, and with 
the finger force the core out. In this 
way you will not split the apple. Finish 
as in the above recipe. 

Stuffed Apple, Compote. 
Compote de Pommes Farcies. 

1 Dozen Apples. 1 Pound of Sugar. 

1 Cup of Orange or Apricot Marmalade.

Pare fine, large apples, take out the 
core, and be careful to leave the apple 
entire. Then fill the opening with orange 
or apricot marmalade, and put them 
together in a pan with a pound of clari- 
fied sugar. Add a half cup of water. 
Let them cook soft in the oven, sprink- 
ling first with grated cinnamon. Add 
grated nutmeg when done, and serve 
either hot or cold. 

Apricot Compote. 

Compote d*Abricots. 

1 Dozen Apricots. 1 Pound of Sugar.

1 Teaspoonful of Vanilla or Lemon 

Extract. 

The "Banana Cassa" Is a form of veg- 
etable fruit that is very much used 
among the Creoles in making compotes, 
etc. It grows on a vine similar to the 
gourd of "Mirllton," only, unlike the lat- 
ter, it is considered a fruit, and is served 
as a dessert. It is a long, pear-shaped 
fruit, resembling the banana in color and 
odor and shape, only it is longer and 
broader. Hence the name, "Banana 
Cassa." It is prepared as follows: 

Take the ripe fruit, peel It, and cut 
into slices of about an inch in thickness. 
Remove the seeds and place the fruit in 
a bowl of water, to which you will add 
a small piece of lime; or simply Immerse 
in lime-water. Let It soak for three 
hours. Then remove it and rinse in cold 
■water. Prepare a syrup, allowing one 
and a quarter pounds of granulated su- 
gar to one quart of water, and when it 
begins to boil well add the fruit, 
ground spices and nutmeg, and let all 
boll until the fruit becomes transparent. 
If flavoring is preferred to the natural 
taste, add, according to taste, a table- 
spoonful of Extract of Lemon or "Vanilla. 
Let it cool and serve as a dessert. It Is 
delicious with "Whipped Cream.

a little salt. Cut them in thin slices 
first, and then in thick threadlike shreds 
just as you would vegetables for 
Julienne soup. This must be done, how- 
ever, before soakifag in the lemon juice 
and salt. Then drain the shreds in a 
clean sieve, and wash them in another 
water, to free them entirely from oil. 
Drain well. Boil one pound of the finest 
white loaf sugar. Then remove it from 
the fire, and throw in the prepared 
cocoanut, and set back on the fire. Let

with the fork, after they have boiled 
up once, and place the cocoanut shreds 
in a sieve. Let the sugar boil up well 
again. Add the juice of a lemon to the 
syrup, boil it very thin, and then throw

one-half cup of water on the fire, and 
add to it four or five pears, which you 
will have cut into pieces. As this formj3 
a syrup place the whole pears in it, and 
let them simmer, adding the lemon juice 
to keep them white. When done, place 
the pears in order in a dish. Let the 
syrup stew doTvn to a nice jelly, and then

Compote of Pineapple, 

Compote d'Ananas. 
1 Pineapple. 1-2 Pound of Sugar. 
1-2 Cup of Water.

very thin. Put it into a syrup made of 
half a pound of sugar, and let it boil up 
once. Take out, and let the syrup sim- 
mer a few minutes longer, poiir over the 
pineapple, and serve. 

Another method very common among 
the Creoles, and O'ften preferred to the 
former by many, is to slice the pineapple 
nicely, place in a dish, sprinkle with 
powdered white sugar, let the pineapple 
form a natural syrup and serve. This is 
delicious. Some add Claret or White 
wine to this compote. 

Compote of Plantain, Creole Style. 

Compote de Plantain a la Creole. 

6 Plantains. 

1-2 Pound of Sugar. 

The Juice of iHalf a Lemon. 

1 Cup of Water. 

Peel the plantains and cut into halves 

or quarters. Put the sugar and water on 

to boil, and, after ten minutes, add the 

lemon juice. Then put the pieces of 

plantain, a few at a time, into the hot 

syrup, and let them stew gently. After 

half an hour, or forty-five minutes, if not 

tender take them out, lay in a dish, pour 

over the hot syrup, and serve either hot 

or cold. 

The plantain is a variety of banana, 

and may be prepared in every manner in 

■which bananas are cooked, such as fried 

bananas, stewed bananas, banana frit 

ters, pudding, cake and pie. (See recipe.) 

Unlike the banana, however, the plantain 

is never eaten raw, as it is a fruit of 

much coarser fiber; but, when cooked, 

equals the banana in delicacy of taste. 

It is a favorite dish on Creole tables. 

Compote of Plantain, Old Style. 

Compote de Plantain a, I'Ancienne Mode. 

6 Plantains. 

1-2 Pound of Sugar. 

1 Pint of Rum. 

Kirsch or Maraschino Sauce. 

The following is a famous Creole way 

of cooking plantains that has fallen in 

desuetude, but which deserves to be 

resurrected as one of the most delightful 

methods of preparing plantains: Have 

ready a pile of hot ashes in the oven. 

Put the plantains (unpeeled) into the 

ashes and cover well with ashes. Let 

them roast thus for half an hour; then 

take out, peel, cut into quarters and 

sprinkle with sugar. Set in the oven a 

few minutes and serve hot, with a Rum, 

Kirsch or Maraschino S'auce. 

Compote of Pomegranates. 

Compote de Grenades. 

1 Dozen Pomegranates. 

3-4 Pound of Sugar. 

1-2 Cup of Water. 

1 Tablespoonful of Orange Juice or 

Maraschino. 

Cut a circle about the size of a 5-cent 

piece out of a peel of the pomegranate, 

using a sharp-pointed knife. Then split 



down the sides of their skins, and care- 
fully remove all the bright ruby plpa 
without bruising them. Throw these into 
a dish. Make a syrup, flavored with 
orange juice or Maraschino^ and pour 
over and serve. 

Compote of Primes. 

Compote de Pruneaux. 

1 Pound of Prunes. 1-4 Pound of Sugar 

1 Glass of Claret. 

Soak the prunes over night in cold 
water, and drain. Put them into a sauce- 
pan with water, cover the saucepan, ana 
let them boil over a moderate fire. When 
they begin to soften, add a glass of Red 
wme and a quarter of a pound of sugar 
Let it boil, stirring frequently, till the 
prunes are cooked well. Then take them 
from the fire, rub a niece of sugar over 
an orance or a lemon, and when it is 
completely saturated with the zest pu: 
into a dish, pour the prunes in with their 
ju;ce, and serve cold. 

It is not absolutely necessary to soak 
the prunes over night, but they cook 
much more easily if you do. Prunes are 
very healthy and are served twice a 
week in every convent in New Orleans. 

Stewed prunes are prepared in exactly 
the same manner as above, only the 
sugar is put on with the prunes and the 
wine is omitted. 

Compote of Raspberries. 

Compote de Framboises. 
1 Quart of Raspberries. 3-4 Pound o£ 
Sugar. 
Select fine Raspberries, but not too 
ripe. Wash them in cold water, and 
drain through a sieve. Boil the sugar, 
and add the berries, and let them boil 
up once very gently. Put them into a 
dish, pour the jelly over, and serve. 
Strawberry Compote. 
Compote de Fraises. 
1 Quart of Strawberries. 3-4 Pound of 
Sugar. 
Select fine strawberries, but not too 
ripe. W^ash them in cold water, and 
drain through a sieve. Boil the sugar, 
and add the berries and let them boil up 
once very gently. Put them into a dish, 
pour the jelly over and serve. 

HOW TO SERVI; FRESH FRUITS AND 
DESSERTS. 

In arranging fruits on the table, the 
higher they are elevated the prettier the 
effect, and the more tempting the sight. 

It is out of taste to mix fruits, cakes 
and bonbons on the same dish. Serve 
each in its own dish, and these alter- 
nating when the dessert is brought on, 
tend much to tempt the appetite of the 
guest. Fruits are most wholesome when 
ripe, and form a part of the well-regu- 
lated family meal for breakfast, as a 
preliminary, and for dinner as an after 
dessert. In serving the desserts that are 
cooked, always be careful to dish them 
nicely and neatly. 

Always serve raw fruits ice cold. ThU 
end is easily attained by placing the 
fruit in an ice box or refrigerator. 



CHAPTER XXXIII. 
PASTRY AND PIES. 



The most important point In making 
pastries of all kinds is to make the 
pastry crust of the proper consistency. 
The crust of pies should always be light, 
flaky and delicately crisp. To attain this 



Patisserie. 

end only the best flour should be used. 
In making Puff Paste, always use Ice 
water. In making pie crust, use tepid 
water if you wish the best results. 
The great secret of all pastry depends 



173 



upon the proper manipulation witli tua 
fingers. 

purr PASTE. 

Pate Feuilletee. 

1 Pint of Flour. 

1 Pound of Good Butter, or Half Lard 

and Half Butter. 

1 Teaspoonful of Salt. 

1 Cup of Ice Water. 1 Egg. 

Have the flour dry and fresh and the 
butter of the freshest. Wash the butter 
well, till it becomes clear and elastic to 
the touch, and cut it into four equal parts, 
and place it in a bowl, which you will have 
cooled with ice water. iSet it away to 
cool and harden. Have your flour sifted 
and ready, and the egg beaten and at 
hand. Put the flour into a bowl and add 
to it a lump of butter; work it with your 
hand, handling always as lightly as pos- 
sible; add the egg, then salt, and, if the 
paste is intended for cakes, a teaspoonful 
of sugar. Work all well, but very lightly 
with the fingers and thumb, and then 
gradually add the ice water, working It 
well and lightly into the flour. When 
all is worked in, knead lightly for about 
five minutes, just as tho'Ugh you were 
making bread. Then cut the dough into 
halves; sprinkle the board lightly with 
flour; take the rollingpin and roll the 
paste out very thin, rolling each half 
into a half sheet. Break the butter into 
bits; take about one-quarter of the re- 
mainder, quickly spread this over the 
paste; then dredge it very lightly with 
flour and lay over it the other sheet. 
Dredge this with flour lightly and pound 
with the rollingpin lightly; then roll this 
from you into a long thin sheet. Spread 
a thin coating of butter over this, and 
then fold the paste over from the sides 
to the center, and then back again, till 
you have three folds. Then turn and roll 
this again till quite thin; add a second 
quarter of butter broken into bits; dredge 
lightly with flour and fold and roll as 
before, always in the same direction — 
from you. Repeat this process, folding 
and rolling, till all the butter is used. 
Then cut the paste into three or four 
parts, according to quantity, and set in 
the ice box in tin plates for twenty min- 
utes, or until you are ready to use. It 
may be kept for several days, if rolled 
in a napkin and set in a cool place. This 
is the paste used in making Vol-au-Vents 
small pates, etc. The most important 
point is the baking. The oven should be 
very hot. If you have used all the best 
materials that wealth can procure, and 
yet do not have the oven properly heated, 
all your efforts will have been in vain. 
Do not set the crust too near the inner 
fire ,part of the oven, as it will bake un- 
evenly, and one side will be higher than 
the other. It is always well to bake 
small pates with a strong underheat, thus 
allowing them to rise to their full height 
before ibrowning. If the oven be too hot, 
and the paste begins to brown as soon as 
put in, quickly open the drafts of the 
stove and reduce the temperature. 

It is well to hake the under crust first 
before putting in the filling In meat pies. 
In baking small patties, cut the dough 
out with a biscuit cutter, leaving the 
outer rounds distinct from the center. 
Remove the center and cut out other 
little rings, and place these one on top 
of the other, above the bottom crust, 
which should be solid. In this way is 
iroduced the effect of each section being 
crisp and apparently separate from the 
other. Some use the white of an egg 
only; others omit it entirely. It is op- 
tional. 



PIB CRUST. 

Pate Brisee. 

3 Cups of Sifted Flour. 

11-2 Cups of Butter. 

1 Tablespoonful of Salt. 

Nearly a CUp of Tepid Water. 

This quantity will make crusts and 
coverings for three ordinary pies. Rub 
the ilour and butter very lightly together, 
being careful not to allow it to harden 
under touch; keep on kneading a littli 
butter at a time into the flour till you 
have used up all and the dough feels 
greasy to the touch. Always remember 
to add the salt before putting in the but- 
ter. iS'ome add a tablespoonful of sugar, 
but the sweetened filling will be gen- 
erally found sufficient. Then add, little 
by little, the water, kneading gently, till 
you have a nice, soft dough, lifting out 
the portion that is wet and continuing to 
knead as you mix the flour and water. 
Always be very careful in adding the 
water, and never wet the flour twice in 
the same place. Mix all together lightly 
with your hands when all is moistened, 
using always your own good judgment 
in adding water. Do not work the dough, 
simply mix lightly and thoroughly, and 
then dredge the board lightly with the 
flour. If you intend to make two pies, 
cut the dough into four parts. Turn the 
paste out upon the board and roll lightly 
and quickly into long, thin sheets. Use 
as little flour as possible in rolling, as 
your dough will grow tough the more you 
work it, and the more you add flour and 
roll it. Remember always that the less 
flour used in rolling, the tenderer will 
be the paste. Therefore always cut the 
dough in as many sections as you intend 
to make pies, allowing for an upper and 
an under crust; this will obviate the 
necessity of rolling it again. Take the 
pie pans immediately, and place a sheet 
of dough over each, and trim the edges 
nicely. Set in the stove, let them bake 
lightly, and then add the filling of fruits. 
Place a light thin cover of crust over 
them, and trim the edges; decorate the 
edges prettily, using the end of a fork 
or spoon, and set in the hot oven to bake 
quickly. When done, set to cool. Sprinkle, 
when cool, with powdered white sugar, 
rolling the loaf sugar into a powder, 
rather than using the pulverized, if yoi- 
wish an elegant taste. 

Paste made with lard may be used for 
meat pies and dumplings, and for stews 
and chicken, when cooked with dump* 
lings. Only roll very thin. Some person? 
use lard for pie crust. This is to be dep- 
recated. The crust will never have the 
same flavor as when made with butter. 
Others, again, mix the butter and lard. 
This, too, is to he condemned if you wish 
for the best results. , , , 

If any pie crust is left, do not think 
of throwing it away. Take all the bits 
left from cutting around the edges of 
the pie pans; roll very thin into small 
squares; bake lightly, and save for tea or 
luncheon. Put a spoonful of orange, pine- 
apple, lemon or raspberry jelly on each 
square, and they will be found delicious. 

FOUNDATION PASTE. 

Pate a Foncer. 

1-2 Pound of Flour. 1-2 Pint of Water. 

1 Ounce of Butter. 1-2 Teaspoonful 

of Salt. 

Sift the flour well; mix with the salt; 
then rub the flour and butter lightly 
together, being careful not to let it hard- 
en under the touch. When the but- 



174 



ter and flour are well kneaded, add the 
water gradually, kneading little by little, 
till well kneaded. Do not work the 
dough; simply mix lightly and tho''- 
oughly. Flour the table lightly, turn the 
paste out upon it, and press in the center 
and around the edges, repeating this 
operation three or four times. Then flat- 
ten the paste, lay on a dish and cover 
with a towel and set in a cool place till 
ready to use, which should be in about 
twenty-five minutes, at least. 

PLAIN PASTE FOB DUMPMNG8. 

Pate a Dresser. 

2 Cups of Sifted Flour. 

1 Large Heaping Kitchenspoonful of 

Butter cr Lard. 

3-4 Cup of Tepid Water. 

1-4 Teaspoonful of Salt. 

Blend the salt and the flour, and then 
gradually mix In the butter, if for apple 
dumplings or rolls. Use lard if intended 
for dumplings for chicken stews, veal 
stewTs, etc. Follow the same directions 
given for making pie paste. Add the wa- 
ter by degrees, using good judgment al- 
ways, and lifting the dough out as yc-u 
wet it, never wetting twice in the same 
place. Mix and knead lightly, and then 
sift a light coating of flour on the board, 
and roll out with the rolling pin, and use 
for all purposes in this book where Plain 
Paste is indicated. If necessary to keep 
the paste awhile, place in a napkin in 
the ice box. But do no-t use ice water in 
mixing it, or you will have a tough 
dough. To attain perfect success in mak- 
ing all pastes, mix quickly, knead slight- 
ly, roll quickly and bake rapidly, using" 
always as little flour as oossible in 
rolling. Never beat pie crust or plain 

fiaste. Tou will harden it and make it 
ust the reverse of the light, palatable 
paste you desire. Use above paste for 
chicken dumplings, meat dumplings and 
apple dumplings, rolling out the dough 
exceedingly thin in small pieces of about 
two and a half inches in length, one in 
width, and at least one-eighth of an inch 
in thickness. 

Apple Pie. 

Tarte aux Pommes. 

4 Large Apples (tart). 1 Cup Sugar. 

1 Teaspoonful Sweet Spices, Blended 

Equally. 

2 Tablespoonfuls of Water. 

1 Tablespoonful Butter, 

Pare and slice the apples nicely. Then 
put them in a porcelain-lined saucepan, 
and let them stew gently, adding the 
water and the butter. Season well with 
a little ground cinnamon, mace and all- 
spice. When done, take off and allow to 
cool a little. Make a flaky pie crust (see 
recipe), and line the tin plates, after 
greasing slightly with butter, and bake 
the bottom crust slightly brown. Take 
out and fill in with the apples, and then 
cover the top with a thin layer of crust. 
Decorate the edges, and set In the oven 
to bake. When a nice, delicate brown, 
take out and let them cc-ol. Remove from 
the tin plate by slightly loosening the 
outer edge with a knife. Turn over into 
a china plate, sprinkle with white pow- 
dered sugar, and serve cold or hot. A 
pie is always better served cold when 
made of fruit. 

The above Is the general rule to be ob- 
served In making pies. Sometimes the 
pies are left open, being covered with 
tiny strips of paste. This is a matter of 
taste. Utilize odd bits of paste and fruits 
thus. 



Apple Tarts. 

Tartlettes aux Pommes. 

4 Ounces of Pie Paste. 3 Ounces of 

Apple Marmalade. 3 Apples. 

2 Ounces of Powdered Sugar. 

1 Pint of Water." 

Prepare the Pie Paste (see recipe), and 
line six tart molds with it. Peel and 
core the apples and cut Into quarters, 
and put into a saucepan with a pint of 
cold water. Let them cook on a hot 
stove for ten minutes. Then remove and 
drain, and let cool for half an hour. Then 
cut the quarters into three slices each" 
line the bottom of the molds with the 
marmalade, divided evenly-; arrange tha 
sliced apples nicely over the marmalade 
and dredge nicely with two ounces of 
powdered sugar. Set in a baking dish 
and bake for twenty minutes, or a half 
hour if necessary, in a moderate oven 
Take out and spread nicely with apple 
marmalade and serve. 

A simpler way is as follows: Pare and 
quarter the apples. Sprinkle lightly 
with sugar. Make a pie crust; roll into 
small bits? place the apples in the open 
crust, fold over, fasten by pressing In 
an ornamental way with a fork, and 
bake in a quick oven until the apples 
are very tender. 

Apple Meringue Pie. 

Tartes de Pommes Meringues.

in Apple Pie. (See recipe.) Fill the pie 
plates with the crust, bake and fill with 
the stewed apples. L«t them bake for 
about twenty minutes, and then spread 
over the top a thick meringue, made by 
beating the whites of three eggs for 
each pie, with three tablespoonfuls of 
powdered sugar, if you desire a deep, 
rich meringue; otherwise, allow the white 
of one e^g and one tablespoonful of 
sugar. Flavor with vanilla or lemon, and 
continue beating till it will stand alone.

thoroughly. Fill the lined pans with 
this, and set in the oven to bake for 
twenty or thirty minutes. Add gradually 
three tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar 
to the whites of the eggs, beating steadily 
all the time, and when it is all absorbed 
beat it to a stiff froth. Place this over 
the top of the pie by spoonfuls, and then 
smooth lightly with the spoon, place in 
the oven, and let it brown. This is a de- 
licious pie. 

Mince Fie. 

Pate de Noel. 

3 Pounds of Beef, Chopped Very Fine. 

1 Pound of Beef or Mutton Suet. 

4 Pounds of Apples, Pared and Chopped. 

2 Jr-ounds of Raisins, Seeded and 

Chopped. 

1 Pound of Sultana Raisins, Picked and 

Washed, 

2 Pounds of Currants, Picked and 

Washed. 

1 Pound of Citron, Cut Very Fine. 
1-2 Pound of Lemon Peel, Grated Very 

Fine. 

2 Pounds of Brown Sugar. 

Pound of Candied Lemon Peel, if Desired. 

2 Grated Nutmegs. 

1 Tablespoonful Each of Ground Cloves 

and Allspice. 

2 Tablespoonfuls of Ground Mace. 
1 Tablespoonful of Fine Salt. 

2 Tablespoonfuls of Ground Cinnamon. 
1 Quart of Good Sherrv or Madeira. 

1 Quart of the Best Brandy. 

The Juice of 2 Lemons. 

The Juice of 2 Oranges, and the Rind, 

Grated Fine. 

The meat should be good and lean, and 
should be boiled the day before needed, 
or early in the morning, and allowed to 
cool. In boiling the meat, plunge it into 
boiling (not cold) water, for the boiling 
water enables it to retain its juices. Boil 
steadily till tender. Then stand away to 
cool. Chop the meat very fine, and clear 
away all gristle and skin. Shred the 
suet, and chop, or, rather, mince It very, 
very fine. Then pare and core the apples, 
and chop very fine. Stone the raisins, 
and cut the citron fine. Many prefer to 
leave out the candied lemon. That is 
according to taste. The mince meat is 
heavier with it. The taste is much more 



177 



delicate and the pie mucli more digestible 
without. Grate the orange and lemon 
peel very fine. Then mix the meat and 
sent together, chopping again, and add. 
all the ingredients, mixing well together. 
Add the juices of the lemon and orange, 
and the grated - rinds, and then mix all 
well again, and pack in a stone jar. Pour 
over this the quart of Brandy, and the 
wine, and cover very tightly, and set in 
a very cool place. Mince meat made in 
this manner should keep all winter. The 
Creoles generally begin to make it, like 
their fruit cakes, just before Thanksgiv- 
ing time, and set it away, having re- 
course to it for Christmas and New 
Year's pies, or whenever needed. When 
ready to use the meat, dish out the quan- 
tity you desire, and thin to the desired 
consistency with good Sherry or Madeira 
wine. Be very careful in picking the cur- 
rants carefully, seeding out all grains of 
sand or dirt and' pieces of twigs of trees. 
Wash them very, very carefully, in cold 
water, separating the good from the bad, 
and the great quantity of refuse that al- 
ways lurks in bought currants. 

The Creoles often use the fresh beef 
tongue or the heart of the beef, well 
chapped and boiled, in making this mince 
meat. The filet of beef is best. Mince 
meat made in this manner never need 
cause dyspepsia. If the housekeeper is 
careful in using it, and in properly keep- 
ing it, it need not be made more than 
once or twice during the winter. I,t 
should be made at least twenty-four 
hours before using. 

To make the pies, line the bottom of 
the pie pans with the pie crust, bake the 
bottom layer, and then fill with the 
mince meat. Cover the pies with a thin 
crust, or leave open if preferred; bake 
till a nice, delicate brown, sprinkle lightly 
with white sugar, and serve hot. Mince 
pies kept from day to day should be 
warmed over before serving.

179 



toy Inexperienced housekeepers, if they 
are expectine company. Pl-aotice first be- 
fore essaying to malce others eat your 
efforts. 

Malte the Puff Paste as directed (see 
Puff Paste), and let it stand in a cool 
place at least six hours. Roll the paste 
out very thin, and then line the deep pan 
in which you intend to cook the chicker. 
or meat, (jut around the edge nicely 
with a knife. Then take another small 
pan and cover it only half way witli 
the paste. Cut around the edges, trim- 
ming off all strings of dough. Then 
brush the paste all around the top with 
a beaten egg. Put it on a sheet iron 
or square tin, and set it on the ice till 
very cold. Then set it in a very hot oven 
to bake for about half an hour. Do not 
let it burn or scorch. When done, fill 
the inside with chicken, pigeon or other 
meat (already fricasseed), with which 
wou intend to make the Vol-au-Vent, and 
then cover with tlie top crust. Fill around 



the edges with strips of paste left over, 
and piled one over another for aboui. 
three thicknesses, set in the oven to bake, 
and serve hot. 

This is the true Vol-au-Vent paste, 
and chicken, pigeons, small birds, veal 
or meats may be used for filling. But 
the best chicken pie is the old-fashioned 
one, made by filling the pan with Tiie 
crust (see recipe), baking it, and the 
edges which you have cut around lightly, 
and then fillmg in with the chicken and 
strips of dough between, and covering 
with a thin cover of the paste, bailing

Prepare a puff paste, and proceed in 
exactly the manner outlined under the 
chapter on "Oysters." (See Oyster Pat- 
ties.) 



CHAPTER XXXrV. 
PUDDINGS. 

Des Poudings. 



We have no real French word for pud- 
ding. Puddings are essentially English 
in origin. French chefs introduced tliem 
into France, retaining, with a slight 
modification of spelling, the expressive 
name for the dish. The Creoles adapted 
the dish to many of the delightful fruits 
of Louisiana. 

Puddings may be either boiled or baked 
One rule may be given for the baked 
pudding, and one for the boiled, or more 
properly, the "roll," and these will be 
the guides of the intelligent cook. In th-? 
boiled puddings It is generally necessary 
to make a dough, using the Plain Paste 
(see recipe), and then the dough is rolled 
out, and the raw fruit placed within. 
The dough is then rolled over and over, 
so as to form layers first of dough, and 
then of fruit. Sew up in a clean cloth, 
and boil till done. 

Blackberry Roll. 
Borurelet aux Mures. 

1 Quart of Blackberries. 
A Plain Paste, Not Too Flaky. 

Make a Plain Paste, which should be 
rather firm, to prevent the berries from 
escaping. Roll this out to about one 
and a half feet in length, or one foot, 
according to the size of the family, and 
the number of guests, one foot being 
ample for a family of six. Spread the 
blackberries, which you will have care- 
fully picked, over this paste, and then 
'carefully roll over and over until the 
entire paste is taken up. Then sew in 
a clean piece of white muslin, and put 
into a kettle of boiling water. Let It boil 
continuously for at least two hours and 
a half. Then take out, let it cool slightly 
rip the cloth which binds it, and serve 
immediately with a Hard S'auce or Cream 
or Brandy Sauce. (See recipes Sauces 
for Puddings, etc.) 

Peach Rolls, Apple Rolls, Banana, 
Strawberry, Raspberry. Cherry and Cur- 
rant Rolls, and Plantain Rolls are made 
in the same manner. Always slice and 
peel the peaches and stone them; also 
stone the cherries, and peel and seed the 
apples. Peel the plantains and bananas 
and slice very thin before rolling in the 
dough. iSome serve the roll cold, but then 
it is always a little tough, for the boiled 
dough hardens easily. A boiled puddin'< 
should always be eaten hot. The nud- 
ding may be boiled in a mold, in which 



case it should be well-covered, and the 
mold first buttered. 

The fruits may be mixed, in which case 
excellent results are produced. 

Boiled Dumplings. 

Echaudes a- I'Anglaise. 

8 Large, Fine, Rosy Apples. Sauce. 

.Prepare a Plain Paste (see recipe), and 
cut into squares, and put in the center 
of each a fine, juicy apple, pared and 
cored, or a half apple, pared and cored. 
Wrap the fruit up in the dough, and 
place these in small dumpling cloths (the 
Creoles sometimes do not use cloths), and 
put them into boiling water, and let them 
boil for at least an hour. On taking out 
the apple, it so desired, the inner core 
may be filled with some delicate jelly or 
marmalade. Serve with Hard, Cream or 
Brandy Sauce. (See recipes Sauces for 
Puddings, etc.) 

Dumplings of other fruits are made In 
the same way. In making a peach dump- 
ling, cut the peach in half, stone It, put 
together again, or place the halves each 
in separate pieces of dough in dumpling 
cloths. Cut bananas and plantains into 
quarters. 

Always dip the pudding and dumplins 
cloths first in hot water before sewing up

Baked Paddings and DompUngs. 

Des Poudings et des Echaudes au Flour. 

In baked puddings this invariable rule 
must be observed — the whites and ths 
yolks of the eggs must be beaten sep- 
arately, if you would achieve the best 
results. Custards come under the same 
class as puddings, in a way, and when 
baked both should be put into the oven 
the moment they are made, and baked 
instantly. Once done, they should be 
taken out, and if to be eaten hot, should 
be served at once; if cold, they should 
be set in a cool, sweet, fresh place. Noth- 
ing so absorbs as milk, and when this in- 
gredient enters into the composition of 
any dish, if it is to be eaten cold, care 
should be taken to keep it In a cool, 
fresh place.

CREAMS. 
Des Cremes. 

General Directions for Making Cream 
Desserts. 

In making creams for desserts, one un- 
failing rule must be observed. In mak- 
ing a cream to serve six or eight persons, 
use either a half box of prepared gela- 
tine, or half a pint of home-made gela- 
tine. The latter. If properly made, is al- 
ways the best, as well as the most eco- 



188 



nomical. The gelatine must be soakeJ 
for about half an hour before using In 
water just sufficient to cover. This is for 
the purpose of softening it. Or it may 
be moistened with a little iSherry or Ma.- 
deira wine. This is according to the taste 
and the usages of the family. The cream 
must always be whipped, the yolks of the 
eggs must be beaten separately trom the 
whites, and the whites of the eggs must 
be beaten to a stiff froth. In using flav- 
oring extracts, select, according to taste, 
Essence of Vanilla, Lemon, Pineapple, 
Almonds, Aromatic Roses, Orange Flower 
"Water, etc. 

Calf's Foot Jelly, or Gelatine. 

Gelee de Pieds de Veau. 

4 Calf's Feet. 5 Quarts of Cold Water. 

1 Pint of White Wine or Sherry. 
Juice of 2 Lemons. Juice of 2 Oranges. 

1-2 of the Zest of a Lemon, Grated. 

The Whites and the Crushed Shells of 

2 Eggs. 

1 Pound of White Sugar. 

2 Teaspoonfuls of Grated Nutmeg. 

1 Stick of Grated Cinnamon. 

W^ash the feet well, scrubbing them 
thoroughly, in cold water. Then put them 
into a kettle to boil with the five quart.s 
of cold water given above. Let theia 
simmer slowly for at least seven or eight 
hours, till the liquor is reduced one-half. 
Then strain the liquid into an earthen 
bowl, and set it away for at least twelve 
hours, or over night. Then skim care- 
fully every particle of fat from the sur- 
face, and remove all sediment or dregs 
from the jelly. Put it into a porcelain- 
lined kettle, and set over the fire, and let 
it melt slowly. Add the whites of the 
eggs, well beaten to a froth, and the 
crushed shells, the ground cinnamon, the 
nutmeg, the sugar and lemon and orange 
juice, and the zest of the lemon. Mix 
all these ingredients thoroughly, and let 
the jelly boil hard, without stirring again, 
for twenty minutes. Then add half a cup 
of water, and let it come again to a boil. 
Set it back on the stove, where it cannot 
boil, and keep it closely covered for half 
an hour. lETave ready a flannel bag, and 
dip it into boiling water. Hang It up 
with a bowl underneath, and pour the 
jelly into the bag, suspending the bag 
from the end of a thick, short pole, 
where it can drip easily. Tie the end of 
the bag, and let the jelly drip freely. On 
no account squeeze or touch it, if you 
wish to have an unclouded jelly. Then 
turn the drippings into a bowl or mold, 
add the wine, and set to cool in a cool 
place. Tou will then have the genuine 
Calf's Foot Jelly, and will know that It 
has not been made of the horns and 
hoofs of animals, etc. 

Whipped Cream. 

Creme Fouettee. 

1 Pint of Sweet Cream. 

2 Tablespoonfuls of Powdered Sugar. 

6 Drops of Jamaica Rum. 

In whipping cream remember that the 
first great essential is to have good 
cream, and that the great secret of whip- 
ping depends upon the rights steady 
stroke. Always set the cream on ice for 
several hours before using. Then sweeten 
it to taste, and add a few drops of Ja- 
maica Rum. Have ready a second bowl, 
beat the cream, or, rather, whip it, as 
you would in beating eggs to a froth, 
with clear, steady strokes, using an egg 
beater, or, if you have a small crank 
churn, which is better, use it, pressing 
the dasher up and down very hard, ana 



removing the cream as it rises around 
the dashboard. In the same way remove 
the cream as it rises, while beating with 
the egg beater, putting the whipped por- 
tion into the second bowl, and continuing 
the process of whipping until all the 
cream is drained. Set on ice, and it will 
keep cool, fresh and sweet and firm. 

The above process is intended when the 
cream is to be used as a garnish for des- 
serts. Any essence may be used, instead 
of the rum. Wlien whipping cream for 
coffee, or when you desire the plain 
whipped cream, do not use sugar or es- 
sence, but simply proceed to whip the 
cream as direcfted above. Good, rich 
milk may be whipped into the cream. 

Having given the above' explicit direc- 
tions, it will be easy for even the veriest 
amateur to make any of the following 
delightful Creole cream desserts: 

Whipped Cream and Strawberries, Basp- 
berries. Blackberries, etc. 

Creme Fouettee aux Fraises ou aux 
Framboises ou aux Mures, etc. 

1 Pint of Berries. 

1 Pint of WTiipped Cream. 

1 Cup of Sugar. 

Stem the berries, sprinkle nicely with 
white sugar, and set aside for several 
hours in a cool place. Serve with the 
whipped cream, dishing the berries first 
in serving, and heaping the cream pret- 
tily on top. 

Whipped Cream With Peaches, Cherrlea, 
etc. 

Creme Fouettee, aux Peches, aux Cerises, 
etc. 

1 Pint of Fruit, Peaches, or Cherries, or 

Bananas, or Pears, etc. 

1 Pint of Whipped Cream. 

1 Cup of Sugar. 

Stone the peaches, and slice or cut 
them nicely, adding sugar to taste. In

CHAPTER XXXVII. 

CAKES. 
Des Gateaux. 



There is scarcely a , girl who can 
make good cake who does not pride her- 
self upon this accomplishment, and "Ma 
Belle Creole" is no exception to this rule 
She may not be able to make a 
"Ratatonille," a la Creole," a "Bisque 
d'Ecrevisses," or turn a pigeon "a la 
crapaudine," but if she knows how to 
make a "Gateau a I'Archange," or a 
"Gateau d'Amandes," it will not 'be long 
before she will treat you to one of these 
dainty Creole cakes, which her "maman" 
will be sure to tell you "Marguerite 
has made all by herself." 

The mixing and baking of cakes has 
always been held a very important 
branch of cookery. The baking is the 
most difficult part, but good cake making 
depends quite as much upon the quality 
and quantity of the ingredents used, and 
the manner of putting them together. 
Attention to the most minute detail in 
mixing is required if you seek success. 
Careless mixing will spoil the most per- 
fect recipe. The greatest accuracy must 
be followed in proportioning out the in- 
gredents, and using just so much, and 
no more. Often a tablespoonful of flour 
above the amount specified will oaus» 
the cake to crack open. The cream, th.? 
butter, the eggs, must be of the best 
quality. A stale egg will spoil the best 
cake, as also rancid butter. No cake 
should be flavored with a poor, cheap 
extract. Care must be exercised in the 
choice of all the materials, care in the 
extract weight specified, care in the 
proper heat of the oven. The following 

General Directions for Making Cakes 

should be ready with care and implicitly 
followed : 

A large earthen bowl is the best for 
mixing and beating the cakes and for 
beating butter and sugar to a cream, as 
is "required in making rich cakes, such 
as pound cakes, etc. 

The hand is the best instrument for 
working the calce, although a wooden 
spoon will be best for stirring in the 
ingredents. The spoon may be used also 
for beating, if you do not know how to 
use the hand dexterously. 

Measure all ingredents carefully be- 
fore beginning to make the cake, anJ 
have alLat hand, within reach. 

The whites and the yolks of the eggs 
must always be beaten separately for 
fancy cakes. 

Use the white pulverized sugar in pre- 
ference to the white granulated for all 
cakes, except gingerbreads, as it makes 
a lighter cake. Sift the flour as often 
as the recipes specify and measure it 
again after sifting. 

If you use cream of tartar instead of 
baking powder, sift the cream of tartar 
into the flour, and disolve the soda that 
must accompany its use in a tablespoon- 
ful of boiling water, and always add it 
to the cake before you add the whites 
of the eggs. 
/ One-half teaspoonful of soda and one 
teaspoonful of cream of tartar may be 
used instead of one teaspoonful of bak- 
ing powder where the recipe calls for 

Raisins should always be picked over 
and divested of the stems and seeded 
before using. 

In making fruit cake, prepare the fruit 
the day before. , , 

Currants should be picked over, washed 
and dried before using. 



Always use the butter thoroughly and 
drain of water before making the cakt 
and be sure that it is fresh, sweet, and 
of the very best quality. 

Sift your flour before weighing. All 
the following recipes are for sifted flour. 

If you use cups for measurements let 
them be of the same size for all ingre- 
dents for the same cake. 

iSour milk will make a spongy cake 
and sweet milk will make a cake wita 
a close grain. 

Never mix sweet and sour milk in the 
same cake. Failure will be the result. 

Let the eggs be sound and fresh, and 
beat thoroughly till light, if you wish 
your cake to succeed. Do not rely en- 
tirely on the baking powder or the soda 
for the rising. The result of such flimsy 
methods will be apparent in the cake. 

Rules for Mixing Ingredients. 

Observe implicitly the following rules: 

Always beat the yolks and the whites 
separately for large cakes. Beat th* 
yolks in an earthern dish till they begin 
to froth and thicken. Beat the whites 
to a froth so stiff that you can cut 
through it with a knife. Beat in a shal- 
low dish with an egg beater or silver 
fork, preferably the egg beater. 

Beat or stir the butter and sugar to a 
cream, rubbing both together steadily un ■ 
til they form a perfect cream. Then, and 
not till then, mix the yolks with the 
butter and sugar. Beat these together 
till very light. Then add the milk, and 
mix thoroughly. Sift the baking powder 
with the flour, and add a little at a 
time, stirring in well, till all is used up. 
Then add the whites of the eggs, beat- 
ing them in thoroughly, and lastly, add 
the flavoring extract. 

Follow without the least variation, thfl 
exact order given above in the mixture of 
ingredients. When the cake is ready to 
bake, line the pan with a piece of but- 
tered paper. This will prevent the cake 
from scorching. Then proceed to bake 
immediately, following the subjoined ex- 
plicit. 

Directions for Baking Cake. 

Have your oven ready. This is most 
important. The oven should be ready 
to bake the cake immediately after it 
is well mixed, as standing makes cake 
batter heavy. 

Test the temperature of the oven be- 
fore putting the cake within. If you 
can hold your hand in the hottest part 
for a quarter of an hour the temperature 
will be correct. 

It you have a Fahrenheit thermom- 
eter, let it be your guide as to the bak- 
ing heat of the oven — 450 degrees is the 
proper heat for drop cakes, rolls, buns, 
tea cakes, muffins, puff paste, etc. If 
you have not a thermometer another 
good test is to throw a little cornmeal 
or flour in the center of the oven. It 
the flour smokes before you can count 
ten, the oven is too hot. If it smokes 
at ten, the oven has the proper heat 
for the above cakes. 

As soon as these are baked the heat 
will be reduced to 400 degrees Fahren- 
heit, and then the oven is ready to 
bake cream puffs, sugar cakes, queen 
cakes, jumbles, lady fingers, jelly rolls, 
etc. When these cakes are baked the heat 
will be reduced to 350 degrees Fahren- 
heit, and the oven will be just at the 



196 



proper temperature to bake wine cakea, 
cup cakes, ginger snaps, gingerbread, 
spice cakes, Madeira cakes, etc. 

Moderate the temperature slightly, and 
the oven will be ready for the baking ol 
large cakes, such as pound, citron, mar- 
ble, white, raisin, currant, almond, maca- 
roons, etc. And, after all these cakes 
are baked, you will have the proper tem 
perature for wedding cake, meringue, 
aniseed cakes, etc. 

Thermometers are so cheap that it 
will pay the young housekeeper to have 
one in the house, rather than spoil in- 
gredents by not having the oven at the 
right baking heat. 

It will be seen from the above that 
cakes made with butter "will require 
a moderate oven; cakes without butter 
will require a quick oven. 

In baking small cakes of cookies have 
a moderately quick oven. 

Bake Molasses cakes in a moderately 
quick oven, and watch carefully, as they 
burn easily. 

A large cake will require more tinne 
to bake than a loaf of bread of the same 
size. From an hour and a half to two 
hours will be sufficient for a pound 
cake. 

To ascertain if the cake is done, take 
a stiff broom straw and run it into the 
center of the cake. When it comes out, 
feel with your fingers. If it is clean 
and dry, the cake is done. If otherwise, 
the cake requires a little more laaking. 
Never introduce any straw until you 
think that the cake is done. 

A thick paper (brown paper is best) 
spread over the top of the cake after 
it begins to bake will prevent R from 
browning too much. If it begins to 
brown as soon as you put it into the 
oven, it is an indication that the oven 
is too hot. Cover the cake with paper, 
and cool the oven by lifting the lid 
of the stove. But this is always risky. 
Have the oven of the right temperature. 

Never set anything else to cook in the 
oven while you are baking a cake. The 
cake will surely fall. 

Never move a cake when you have 
once set it in the oven till the center 
is perfectly firm and set. If you do, it 
will fall. If one side seems to be brown- 
ing faster than the other, have recourse 
to the brown paper on top. 

When you set the cake in the oven 
shut the door very gently, and be care- 
ful not to jar the cake, or it will, be 
heavy. Do not open the door for about 
ten minutes, and then as little as pos- 
sible, and very gently. If the cake Is 
browning too quickly, cover with a layer 
of thick paper. 

Watch the cake while baking, but never 
leave the oven door open. When nec- 
essary to look at the cake, gently do it 
as quickly as possible, and then shut the 
door carefully, without jarring the cake. 

A cake should rise to its full height 
before the crust begins to form. If It 
hardens too fast, have recourse Im- 
mediately to covering with paper. 

Keep the oven at a steady, regular 
heat, the same at the top as at the bot- 
tom. 

Never take the cake out of the oven 
until you are sure it Is done. The broom 
splint, clean and dry, run through the 
center, is an Infallible test. 

Let the cake cool in the pan in which 
it was baked, as it is apt to become 
heavy if turned while hot. Never han- 
dle the cake while hot. 

If the cake Is streaky It shows that 
It was not mixed properly, or that the 
baking was rapid or unequal, or that the 



oven's temperature suddenly decreased 
before the cake was done. 

When the cake is cool, if you wish 
to ice it, proceed as follows: 

How to Ice Cakes. 

Take one pound of pulverized sugar 
and the whites of two eggs. Have the 
eggs set in the refrigerator for about 
an hour before using. Beat the eggs and 
the sugar and a teaspoonful of rose or 
orange flower water or vanilla essence 
together till the eggs are very light 
In commencing to beat do not beat the 
whites separately. Break them into a 
cold, shallow dish, and throw in a hand- 
ful of sugar at a time, beating mean- 
while, and adding at short intervals, 
till you have used up all the sugar. Or 
beat the whites and the sugar and 
essence together. When the mixture Is 
stiff and smooth, begin to lay a thin 
coating of the ice over the cake, using 
a knife to spread it, and occasionally 
dipping the knife into the lemon juice, 
which will enable you to smooth it nicely 
When it is covered with this first coat, 
set in a warm place to harden — or in a 
moderate oven, where you may let it re- 
main about four minutes, or in the sun- 
shine where there is no dust around. 
When it is hardened it will be ready for 
the next coat. Proceed as above. This 
coat will be much smoother and whiter 
than the first. Let the thickness of the 
icing always be such that It will run 
very slow. If the Icing is well prepared 
this will give a smooth, glossy surface. 
Instead of the essence, the juice of a lem- 
on (one tablespoonful) may be added to 
the icing. If you wish to use ornaments, 
secure a piping tube, and place the or- 
naments around the cake while moist, 
running a plain tube around the edge 
of the cake, and then covering the cake 
with a thin icing level with the rim. 
Let It run smooth, and dry in the sun 
or in the oven. The sun is always best, 
if you are not in a very great hurry. 

The above recipe is for plain icing. It 
may be varied according to taste by 
using pineapple, strawberry, or other 
flavoring. In using strawberry icing, add 
a few drops of cochineal to color. For 
further particulars as to different icings 
for cakes, see special section on "Icing? 
and Frostings for Cakes."

1-2 Ounce of Yeast.

This Is a Creole cake whose history is 
the history of the famous New Orleans 
carnivals celebrated in song and stories. 
The "King's Cake," or "Gateau de Roi," 
is inseparably connected with the origin 
of our now world-famed carnival balls. 
In fact, they owe their origin to the oil 
Creole custom of choosing a king and 
queen on King's Day, or Twelfth Night. 
In old Creole New Orleans, after the in- 
auguration of the Spanish domination 
and the amalgamation of the French 
settlers and the Spanish into that pe- 



culiarly chivalrous and romantic rac?, 
the Louisiana Creole, the French prettily 
adopted many of the customs of their 
Spanish relatives, and vice versa. Among 
these was the traditional Spanish celebra- 
tion of King's Day, "Le Jour des Roia," 
ag the Creoles always term the day. 
King's Day falls on January 6, or the 
twelfth day after Christmas, and com- 
memorates the visit of three Wise Men of 
the East to the lowly Bethlehem manger. 
This day is even in our time still the 
Spanish Christmas, when gifts are pre- 
sented in commemoration of the King'd 
gifts. With the Creoles it became "La 
Petit Noel," or Little Christmas, and 
adopting the Spanish custom, there were 
always grand balls on Twelfth Night; a 
king and a queen were chosen, and there 
were constant rounds of festivities, night 
after night, till the dawn of Ash Wednes- 
uay. From January 6, or King's Day, 
to Mardi Gras Day became the accepted 
Carnival season. Each week a new kin;^ 
and queen were chosen, and no royal 
rulers ever reigned more happily than 
did these kings and queens of a week. 

To make the cake take a pound and a 
half of the above-mentioned quality of 
flour, and put it in a wooden bread 
trough. Make a hole in the center of the 
flour, and put in a half ounce of yeast, 
dissolved in a little warm water. Adi 
milk or tepid water to make the dougi, 
using milk if you want it to be very rich 
and delicate, and water if you have not 
the milk. Knead and mix the flour with 
one hand, while adding the milk or water 
with the other. Make a dough that is 
neither too stiff nor too soft, and when 
perfectly smooth set the dough to rise in 
a moderately warm place, covering with 
a cloth. Remember that if you use milk 
to make the dough it must be scalded, 
that is, must be heated to the boiling 
point, and then allowed to grow tepid. 
Let the dough rise for five or six hou^^, 
and, when increased to twice its bulk, 
take it and add the reserved half pound 
of flour, into which you will have sifted 
the salt. Add six eggs, beaten very light 
with the sugar and butter, and mix all 
well together, kneading lightly with your 
hands, and adding more eggs if tha 
dough is a little stiff. Then knead the 
dough by turning it over on itself three 
times, and set to rise again for an hour 
or three-quarters of an hour. Cover wi*a 
a cloth. At the end of this time take it 
up and work again lightly, and then form 
into a great ring, leaving, of course, a 
hole in the center. Pat gently and flat- 
ten a little. Have ready a baking nac 
with a buttered sheet of paper in it, anil 
set the central roll in the middle. Cover 
the pan with a clean, stiff cloth, and set 
the cake to rise for an hour longer, 
"WTien well risen, set in an oven a few de- 
grees cooler than that used for bakms 
bread; let bake tor an hour and a ha?f; 
if medium, one hour, and If very small, 
a half hour. Glace the Brioche lightly 
with a beaten egg, spread lightly over the 
top before placing in the oven. Decorate 
with dragees, caramels, etc. 



In making layer cakes, always havo 
ready three or four jelly tins, and baVe 
the cake in layers In the separate tins for 
fifteen minutes. Then set to cool, an<l 
make the fillings and place alternately 
between the layers, a layer of cake al- 
ways being on top, to admit of icing, if 
desired.

CHAPTER XXXrX. 
DFSSEBT CAKES. 

Patisserie Fine Pour Dessert. 



Des Bonchees, Macarons, Massepains, 
Meringues, Melees, Creoles. 

Biscuits aux Amandes et aux Pistaohe^, 
Amandes Souffles, etc. 

Perhaps no cuisine can boast of such 
a number of delicious small cakes that 
may serve for desserts, both elegant and 
choice, as the Creole cuisine. The native 
ingenuity of the Creole chefs adapted 
many of the nuts and fruits of Louisian.x 
to various forms of sweetened batter, and 
the result of their efforts, handed down 
from generation to generation, is given 
in the following carefully compiled rs- 
cipes, which, perhaps, after our unique 
"Gumbos," "Courtbouillons," "BouiUa- 
baise," "Ragouts" and "Jambalayas," will 
serve better than any other recipes to 
give a true idea of the Infinite variety 
and delight of the properly conducted 
Creole kitchen. They will also give » 
glimpse Into the interior life of the Cre- 
ole household, some of them, especially, 
being associated with pleasant, simple 
forms of "soirees," that, alas! have al- 



most passed away since the intercourst 
of the old French quarter with the Amer- 
ican city above Canal' street has become 
so general. 

Advice and Instructions for Bakinff 
These Cakes. 

Use the best materials. It always pays 
in the delicate and perfect taste of the 
cake. 

Soda, if not properly dissolved, wlU 
give to cakes and biscuits a bad, greer- 
ish color. 

Keep the cake out of the draft while 
beating and baking. All the following 
cakes, as, indeed, all cakes, should be 
baked in their own steam, that is, keep 
the door and damper shut till the cakes 
have finished spreading. Then, if the 
oven is hot enough, you may open th« 
damper. This gives the cake a light, 
bright color. Remember meringues and 
other large cakes are not intended In 
these Instructions. For meringues the 
oven must never be very hot. 

If you are expert at baking, you may 



209 



test the heat of the oven simply by 
touching the handle of the oven door, 
but a sure test for beginners is to thronv 
a little cornmeal or flour in the center 
of the oven, count ten, and if the flour 
begins to smoke before you count the 
full number the oven is too hot, it il 
smolces at ten the oven has the proper 
heat. 

Never put flavoring extracts directly 
into the flour, or they will form lumos. 
Always put them in the wet part of the 
mixture. 

BOUCHEBS. 

These are a delicious form of dessert 
cakes, and are considered both elegant 
and recherche. Great care must be taken 
to trim the cakes evenly and of equal 
size before attempting to finish them. 
Bouchees are made with batter and also 
• with alraC'St all our Louisiana fruits. 
As the name indicates Bouchees are 
simply "a mouthful." 

Bouchees de Dames. 

9 Eggs. 1 Pound of White Pulverized 

Sugar. 

1-2 Pound of Flour. 

The Juice of 1 Lemon. 

1 Tablespoonful of Vanilla Extract. 

1 Cup of Currant or Other Jelly for 

Pilling. 

Transparent Icing to Garnish. 

Prepare a sponge or cup cake batter. 
(See recipe under chapter "Cakes.") Have 
ready a baking sheet, which you will 
cover with white writing paper, i^ay the 
batter out on the paper by forcing ii 
through a biscuit cutter in rounds that 
will measure one inch and a half In 
diameter. They will spread. Dredge the 
surface with white sugar very lightly, 
and bake them for about fifteen minutes 
or less, until they are a light color. Then 
trim nicely and place them upon a wire 
drainer. Place circular pieces of currant 
or other preserves on top, and garnish 
with a meringue or Transparent Icing. 
(See recipe.) Set in the stove or the sun 
to dry, and in ten minutes they will be 
ready to serve. 

Bouchees With Oranses. 
Bouchees aux Oranges. 

9 Eggs. 1 Pound of Pulverized Sugar. 

1-2 Pound of Flour. 

The Juice of 1 Orange or 1 Tablespoonful 

of Extract. 

1 cup of Orange Marmalade. 

Transparent Icing to Garnish. 

Prepare the cake drops as directed 

above, with sponge or cup cake batter. 

Then place thin slices of oranges cooked 

in syrup on the Bouchees (see Orange 

Marmalade), and gloss them over with 

Transparent Icing. (See recipe:) Flavor 

the batter of these Bouchees with the 

zest of an orange or with Curacoa 

Liqueur. (See recipe.) 

Bouchees With Peaches. 
Bouchees aux Peches. 

9 Eggs. 1 Pound of White Pulverized 

fl'ugar. 

1-2 Pound of Flour. 

1 Tablespoonful of Noyau Extract. 

1 Cup of Preserved Peaches. 

Transparent Icing to Garnish. 

Prepare the drop cakes as directed In 
"Bouchees de Dames." Place halves of 
peaches, preserved in syrup, over th'2m 
(home-made preserves), and gloss over 
with Transparent Icing, flavored with 
Noyau, and slightly tinged with Carmine. 
(See retipe.) 



In preparing all these bouchees, do not 
allow any excess of moisture from the 
preserves. The syrup should become ei- 
tirely absorbed into the bouchee befors 
you attempt to gloss it with ihe icing. 

Bouchees with apricots or cherries arc 
prepared in the same way, using, in the 
former case, a flavoring of Cedratl 
liqueur, and in the latter Maraschino. 

In making bouchees with preserves use 
any kind of marmalade to stick two 
bouchees together, and ice the surface. 

Bouchees With Pineapples. 

Bouchees aux Ananas. 

9 Eggs. 1 Pound of Pulverized Sugar. 

1-2 Pound of Flour. 

1 Cup of Preserved Pineapples. 

Transparent Icing to Garnish.

half in diameter. Pl3,ce smaller slices of 
thin, preserved pineapple upon each, and 
gloss or glace over with Transparent 
xcing (see recipe), flavoring with pine- 
apple syrup.

by pushing it between the finger and 
thumb. Then drain and cool the almonds 
in cold water, and drain again. Rub the 
almond skins or hulls off with your 
hands in a cloth, throw the almonds in 
cold water with a little salt, wash clean, 
drain and dry them in another cloth. 
The almonds must be cold before you put 
them into a mortar. Then pound them 
to a pulp that will be as smooth as flour. 
Beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff 
froth. Add a little of the sugar and a 
little of the eggs as you pound, to pre- 
vent the almonds from becoming oily. 
Remember always that the paste muf^t 
be kept firm as you add the remainder of 
the sugar and the eggs. Have ready a 
baking sheet, on which you will have 
placed a buttered piece of wafer paper. 
Lay the macaroons out on this, by drop- 
ping them from the spoon, in the form of 
a guinea fowl's egg. Be very careful to 
place the macaroons about an inch 
apart,' so that the balls will not touch one 
another. When the sheet is full, pass » 
■wet paste brush gently over their surface. 
Put them in the oven, and bake at a very 
moderate heat till they are a light, deli- 
cate browTi or fawn color. When donf?, 
take out and set to cool, and take away

together till thoroughly incorporated. Fill 
the biscuit forcer, and push the maca- 
roons through upon buttered wafer paper, 
as directed. 

Petits Fours must be baked in a very 
moderate oven. Otherwise the excessive 
heat will cause the macaroons to run 
into one another and produce a useless 
mass. The Royal Icing necessitates the 
moderated oven. The Petits Fours are

MERINGUES. 

In order to make meringues properly 
one should have a meringue board of 
well-seasoned hard wood. This board 
should be cut with rounded corners, 
and of a size convenient to the oven. 
It ought to be about one and a half 
inches in thickness. While baking. Mer- 
ingues must always remain soft under- 
neath. To accomplish this, dampen the 
board thoroughly with water before plac- 
ing the bands of paper upon it. In 
this way the Meringues are prevented 
from receiving heat in sufficient volume 
to render them hard underneath.

1 Pint of Sifted White Sugar. 
The Whites of 12 Eggs. 
1 Tablespoonful of Vanilla. 
Beat the whites to a stiff, snowy froth, 
and then gradually add the sugar and 
vanilla, beating until the mixture is stiff 
enough to cut with a knife. Then cut 
some stout sheets of foolscap paper into 
strips measuring at least two inches in 
width, or, if you wish to make the 
meringues larger, simply place the sheet 
of paper, slightly buttered, on the table 
Take a tablespoon and gather up the 
meringue mixture as nearly as possible 
in the shape of an egg, and working it 
towards the side of the bowl to give 
It this shape, and then drop sloplngly 
from the spoon upon the strips of paper 
at a distance of at least an inch apart. 
Draw the edge of the spoon very sharply 
around the edge of the meringue, to 
give it a smooth, round siiape, resembling 
an egg. When all the rows are filled, 
sprinkle sifted sugar over them, and 
let them remain in this state for about 
three minutes. Then take hold of the 
strips at either end, and shake lightly, 
to remove all excess of sugar. Place the 
strips in rows about one inch apart on 
the wet board or baking tin (the board 
Is much better), and as soon as the 
sugar begins to dissolve slightly on their 
surface, push them into the oven, whioli 
must be at a very moderate heat, and 
bake them a very light fawn color. 



Watch constantly, that tKey may not 
burn. When the meringues are done, 
remove each one very carefully and 
separately from the paper. Then use a 
small dessert spoon, if you desire to fill 
the meringues, scoop out the soft white 
part, and, with the outer side of the 
bowl of the spoon, smooth the interior of 
the meringues. Then place them with the 
rounded side downward on the baking 
tin in the oven to dry for a few min- 
utes. When thoroughly crisp, without 
browning, place them between sheets of 
paper in a dry place. When using 
meringues for desserts, etc., garnish the 
interior with whipped cream, beaten to 
a stiff froth, and flavored with vanilla, 
orange, lemon, orange flower water, or 
any kind of fancy liqueur; stick the two 
halves together lightly and serve. Merin- 
gues may be kept for some time In 
their dry shell state, and filled when 
ready to use. In making them for im- 
mediate family use, simply drop the 
mixture by spoonfuls on buttered paper, 
dust with the sugar, wait for three min- 
utes, fan or blow off all excess of 
sugar, and then place them in a very 
moderate oven and bake to a light brown. 
When dry, carefully remove the meringue 
from the paper, after they have cooled, 
brush the bottoms slightly with the white 
of an egg, beaten to a froth, stick two 
meringues together, put away to dry, and 
serve when needed.

much smaller than the ordinary Mer- 
ingues — about the size of a bird's egg. 
Proceed as above, and fill with stiff, 
whipped cream, taking great care when 
filling that none of the cream shall 
ooze from between the two halves of 
the Meringues after they have been 
stuck together. If it should, wipe it 
off very carefully. Wlien well-filled, 
hold each Meringue separately on a 
silver fork, and dip them all over in 
"Transparent Icing" (see recipe), and 
let them dry. These Meringues are de- 
licious desserts.

These are elegant cakes and enhance 
the most fashionable dessert. Make a 
strong- cake or cup cake (see recipes), 
and bake on a baking sheet about three- 
quarters of an inch in thickness. When 
cold, cut up into fanciful shapes, trim 
the edges neatly with a very sharp knife, 
and be careful to brush off the last 
particle of crumbs that may adhere; 
carefully spread the upper part and 
sides of the biscuit with apricot, peach, 
raspberry or any jam. Then hold one 
at a time on a silver fork, very care- 
fully, and with a spoon pour over Trans- 
parent Chocolate Icing, around sides and 
over the surface of the biscuit. Then 
carefully lay it upon a wire tray, resting 
upon a baking sheet. Dry the biscuit 
in a very moderate oven for about five

CHAPTER XLI. 
ICE CREAMS, BISCUIT, SHERBETS. 



Des Cremes a la Glace, 

In making ice creams, always use th*? 
best, fresh, sweet, rich milk or cream. 
Sweeten it with finely-powdered sugar, 
and flavor with the best quality of ex- 
tracts, such as lemon, vanilla, etc., whicii 
should be procured from first-class, re- 
liable druggists. These are the simplest 
means of flavoring. Sometimes, how- 
ever, the old Creoles boil the Vanilla 
Bean until the aroma is extracted, and 
when cool they add it to the sweetenel 
cream. Always avoid setting the cream 
near the fire, especially in warm weather, 
as it sours easily. Keep it in the refrig- 
erator till ready to freeze. 

How to Make Ice Cream. 

Some persons boil the milK and eggs, 
thus making a custard ice cream. This 
is the cream that the old Creoles prefer 
best. But there are others who prefer 
the cream unboiled. In either case it Is 
absolutely necessary to have rich, fresh 
cream, and In the latter case to sca'd 



Biscuits, Glacees, Sorbets. 

the cream, if you wish to have a good lc<" 
cream. 

The following is the approved Creole 
method of making 

Ice Cream. 

Creme a la Glace. 

1 Quart of Milk or Cream. 6 Eggs. 

3-4 Pound of Sugar. 

1 Tablespoonful of Any Extract. 

Put the milk or cream on to boil. If 
cream is used, six eggs will be sufficient; 
if milk, use eight. Beat the yolks of the 
eggs and the sugar very light, and then 
heat the whites to a stiff froth. Take th« 
milk off the fire and pour it over the 
sugar and the yolks, stirring it ail the 
while. Then add the whites, mixing thor- 
oughly, and two tablespoonfuls of ex- 
tract of either Lemon or Vanilla. S'«t 
to cool, and then turn into the freezer, 
pack and stir around in the ice for about 



218 



ten minutes, and finish as in recipe for 
making" and freezing cream. (See re- 
cipe.) 

How to Freeze the Cream. 

Before putting the mixture into the 
freezer, see that the dasher is right side 
up and that everything is in proper con- 
dition and adjustment. Have the Ico 
pounded, and a sufficient quantity of 
rock salt. Put a three-and-a-half inch 
layer of ice into the bc-ttom of the freezer, 
and then a layer of salt, fully an inch 
and a half deen Then put in the can 
and continue to fill around it with alter- 
nate layers of ice and salt till the freezer 
is full. Then turn the crank slowly un- 
til it is som.ewhat difficult to turn it. Let 
off the water that has accumulated, and 
refill with ice, and then cover with a 
thick piece of bagging or carpet. Then 
let it stand aside in a cool place to ripen, 
till you are ready to serve. Then proceed 
as above. 

Fruit puddings and custards may be 
frozen in the same manner. 

How to Mold Ice Cream. 

When ready to serve, if you wish to 
take the cream out of the mold whole, 
have ready a dish with a flat bottom, 
and a pan of hot water. Then roll the 
tin mold for an instant only in the water, 
and wipe it quickly, holding the top 
downwards. Remove the lid, and quicklv 
turn it right side up, setting the plate on 
the table and removing the mold care- 
fully. Or you may wring out cloths in 
scalding water and wrap them an instant 
around the mold, and proceed as above. 
This is a very delicate way of serving the 
cream, and admits of it being brought 
to the table in all its beauty and fresh- 
ness and perfection of molding. 

The cream may also te molded Into 
a single brick by having a brick-shapsd 
mold and filling it with the cream. When 
well filled, press down closely and cover 
the mold carefully, so that no pieces of 
salt or any salt water can enter it o*- 
penetrate it. Fill the bottom of a pail 
with ice, mingled with rock salt; lay the 
mold upon it, surround and cover with 
the broken pieces of ice and mingled rock 
salt; cover and let freeze for about- half 
an hour. When frozen, set mold in luke 
warm water, wash off portions of ice 
and salt, lift the mold out gently, un- 
cover, turn into a dessert dish and serve 
immediately.

oughly for five minutes, till well dl^ 
solved in the cream. Then strain through 
a fine sieve into a freezer, pressing the 
fruit down with a wooden spoon, and 
when well packed proceed to freeze as ii> 
the directions for Plain Ice Cream. (See

de Violettes, to obtain the royal purpln. 
Freeze in separate molds. Then pack into 
one freezer, and when frozen remove, ac- 
cording to directions for taking Ice cream 
whole from a mold. Cut in slices and

MIDDLE COURSE DRINKS. 

Coup de Millieu. 

From earliest Creole days no elegant 
dinner or luncheon or supper was con- 
sidered complete without a "Coup de Mil- 
lieu," or a middle course, consisting of 
a form of iced sherbet or punch, into 
which fruit Juices or fancy liqueurs were 
added. As the name "Coup de Millieu" 
indicates, these fancy punches were 
brought to the table in the middle of the 
feast, just before the roasts were served. 
The custom was a survival of the ancient 
French and Spanish usage, that in our 
day has been adopted by all leading 
Northern caterers. The following are the 
most famous "Coup de Millieus," the re- 
cipes for which are traditional among the 
old Creole families of New Orleans. The 
"Coup de Millieu" is always frozen, but 
it must be remembered that it is never 
possible to freeze it entirely, on account 
of the alcohol in the liquors that enter 
into its composition.

Cardinal Panch. 

Ponche Cardinal. 

4 Fine Louisiana Oranges. 

1 Pint of tlie Best Claret or Any Fine 

Red Wine. 

1 Pint of Old Port Wine. 

1 Pint of Water. 

2 Tablespocnfuls of Cloves. 

1 Pint of Gelatine or the Whites of 10 

Eggs, Beaten to a Froth. 

2 Pounds of White Sugar. 

3 Tablespoonfuls of Raspberry Juice or 
a Few Drops of Cochineal. 

Select fine Louisiana oranges, when in 
season, otherwise fine, ripe oranges. Set 
them on a plate in the oven, and let 
them bake till very tender, without let- 
ting the juice exude. Make a boiling 
syrup of the sugar, water and the cloves. 
Drop the roasted oranges into the syrup, 
add a pint of the best Claret or any good, 
red wine, and set the mixture to cool, 
letting the oranges steep in the wine 9,nd 
syrup. When it grows cold, cut the 
oranges and press out all the juice, mash- 
ing them Into steeped syrup, and then 
strain all through a fine sieve into the 
ice cream freezer. Now add the gelatine 
(Calf's Foot Jelly) or the whites of ten 
eggs, beaten to a stiff froth. Stir well 
and add the raspberry juice, if raspber- 
ries are in season, otherwise co-lor with a 
few drops of Cochineal, so that the nunch 
will be of a bright cardinal color. Cover 
immediately and set to freeze as hard as 
possible for three or four minutes. Then 
take a wooden spoo'U and detach the 
frozen punch from the bottom, mix in 
with the inner liquid mixture, and cover 
and freeze again for three or four min- 
utes. Repeat this four or five times. 
Serve in punch glasses. 

A simpler and quicker way of making 
this punch is to prepare a Raspberry 
Sherbet, using half the quantity of In- 
gredients given. (See recipe.) Strain 
this preparation through a sieve into a 
freezer, and add a half a gill of red Cu- 
racoa and half a gill of Maraschino; 
cover the freezer and proceed to freeze 
according to general directions given 
above. Serve in punch glasses. This is 
a very pleasant middle course drink, but 
the first recipe given is the true Cardinal 
Punch, and there is no comparison be- 
tween this and the latter, or more simple 
recipe. 

Cardinal Punch is an old-time Creole 
punch. The French used to make a fa- 
mous spiced wine, which they called 
"Vin de I'Eveque," or "Bishop's Wine." 
When the spiced wine was made of 
Claret, it was called "Vin de Cardinale," 
or "Cardinal's Wine." These wines w©ra 
served during the feast. The "Coup de 
Millieu," or the frozen punches, are sur- 
vivals of the old French custom of serv- 
ing spiced wines, and "Ponche a la Car- 
dinale" is a survival of the ancient "Vin 
a la C'ardinale." The Creoles adapted 
oranges to the punch, baking them to 
better extract all the juices, and steepinfi 
them in wine and adding the touch of 
C!ochineaI to obtain brilliancy of color- 
ing and still further to carry out the Idea 
of a Cardinal's colors.

FROZEN TBUITS. 

Des Fruits Glacees. 

The variety of fruits always to be 
found in the New Orleans markets is 
the pleasure and surprise of visitors to 
the city, as well as a delight to the resi- 
dents. No manner of serving fruits in 
summer is more acceptable than the 
methods of freezing them in vogue among 
the Creoles. 

Remember that in freezing fruits they 
must always be mashed or cut very fine, 
for fruit freezes more quickly than liquid. 
Fresh fruits are always more delicious 
than canned fruits. The latter are rarely 
used for freezing in Creole homes, as 



fresh fruits in season are always to be 
found in our markets. 

Tlie following recipe for freezing fruits 
will serve for almost all kinds of fruit: 

How to Freeze Fruits. 

Take one pound of fruit, or one can. 
two cups of sugar, and one pint of water. 
Cut fine, and mix all the ingredients to- 
gether. Then freeze in the ice cream 
freezer, according to directions already 
given for freezing. 

The proportions of ingredients used 
in freezing fruits are generally one pint 
of fruit, one pint of water and half a 
pound of sugar. Increase in proportion. 
Peaches and such fruits as are watery 
may often be frozen without addition of 
water. Serve with rich cream or milk. 

Frozen Apricots. 

Abricots Glacees. 

2 Fine, Ripe Apricots. 

2 Cups of Sugar. 

1 Pint of Water or Cream. 

Pare the apricots, cut them in two, re- 
move the stones, and cut in small pieces. 
Mash the fruit and the sugar together, 
add the water or cream, and turn into 
the freezer and proceed to freeze as in 
Ice Cream. (See recipe Ice Cream.) 

Frozen Bananas. 

Bananes Glacees. 

1 Dozen Mne Bananas. 

3-4 Pound of Sugar. 

1 Pint of Sugar or Cream. 

The Juice of 2 Oranges. 

Peel the bananas, cut them very fine 

and mash well; add the cream or water 

and the orange juice, turn into the freezer 

and pack away in ice and rock salt. Set 

to freeze according to directions given 

for freezing Ice Cream. (See recipe.) 

Frozen Cherries. 

Cerises Glacees. 

1 Pound of Cherries. 
1 Pound of Sugar. 
1 Quart of Water. 

Stone the cherries, mix them with the 
sugar and add the water. Mix well and 
turn into the freezer and proceed to 
freeze as in directions for Ice Cream. 
(See recipe.) Serve with Whipped Cream 
or rich milk. 

Frozen Oranges. 
Oranges Glacees. 

6 Fine Oranges. 

1-2 Pound of Sugar. 

1 Pint of Water. 

Pare the oranges, and grate or out 
them into fine pieces. Mix well with the 
sugar and set aside for an hour. Add 
the water and mix thoroughly. Turn mto 
a freezer and proceed to freeze as in Ice 
Cream. (See recipe.) 

Another delightful way is to cut off the 
tops of the oranges, about two inches 
deep; then, with a small and very sharp 
knife, remove the orange skin whole, 
being careful not to break. Set the 
orange covers to one side. Scoop out the 
inside of the oranges, being careful not 
to break the outer skin. Take these 
oranges and arrange nicely in a square 
Biscuit Glaeee mold, and set in a tub. 
the bottom of which has been filled with 
broken pieces of ice and rock salt. Pre- 
pare a Champagne Punch (see recipe), 
fill the interiors of the oranges with this, 
set the orange covers on, and place the 
cover on the mold, covering very tight. 



226 



Cover well with broken pieces of ice and 

rock salt and set to freeze for an hour. 

Then take from the mold, place on a very 

cold dessert dish and serve inamediately 

Frozen Peaches. 

Peches Glacees. 

12 Large Peaches. 

2 Cups of Sugar. 

1 Pint of Water. 

Take twelve large peaches or one can, 

two cups of sugar, and one pint of water. 

Cut the peaches fine, and mix all the 

ingredients together. Then freeze in the 

ice cream freezer according to directions 

already given. 

Peaches, if very juicy, may often be 
frozen without addition of water. Serve 
with rich cream or milk. 

Frozen Pineapple. 
Ananas Glacees. 
1 Large Pineapple. 
1 Pound of Sugar. 
1 Pint of Water. 
Pare the pineapples. Cut out the eyes, 
and then grate the fruit, or cut it very 
fine. Add the sugar and water and stir 
well. When the sugar is thoroughly dis- 
solved, turn the mixture into a freezer, 
and proceed to freeze as in Ice Cream. 
(See recipe.) 

Frozen Strawberriee. 

Fraises Glacees. 

1 Quart of Strawberries. 

1 Pound of Sugar. 

1 Pint of .Water. 

Mash the berries with the sugar and 

set aside for an hour. Add the water 

and mix well with the SFtrawberries. Turn 

the mixture into the freezer and proceed 

to freeze as in Ice Cream (see recipe). 

Serve with rich milk or Whipped Cream. 

Macedoine of Frnits. 

Macedoine de Fruits. 

1 Quart of Lemon Ice Cream. 

The Juice of 3 Lemons. 



1-2 Teaspoonful of Vanilla Extract. 

2 Ounces of Stoned Cherries. 

2 Ounces of Pineapples, Cut in Dice. 

2 Ounces of Strawberries. 

2 Ounces of Grapes. 2 Ounces of Peache^s. 

2 Ounces of Apricots. 

2 Ounces of Oranges. 

1 Ounce of Candied Cherries. 

1 Ounce of Angelica. 

1 Ounce of Candied Pieapple, 

1 Gill of STierry Wine. 

Prepare a quart of Lemon Ice Cream 
(see recipe.) Add to this a half teaspoon 
ful of vanilla, 2 ounces each of stoned 
cherries, pineapple cut into dice shape, 
2 ounces of strawberries, 2 ounces of 
grapes, apricots, peaches and grapes cui 
into small pieces, and the candied fruits 
in equal proportions. Add a gill of Sher- 
ry wine, mix all the fruits lightly, turn 
into a freezer and proceed to freeze as 
in Ice Cream. (See recipe.) 

Again, this Macedoine may be prepared 
by using instead of the Lemon Cream a 
pint of syrup made of sugar and water 
to which has been added the juice of 
three lemons. 

A very delightful and pretty way of 
freezing this Macedoine is to prepare the 
cream, mix the candied fruits and fresh 
fruits together; have ready a square ice 
cream mold, and place one-fourth of the 
lemon cream at the bottom; divide the 
fruits into three parts, and i>lace one 
portion on top of the cream. Cover this 
w^ith another portion of cream, and lay 
on top the fruits. Again cover with the 
cream, and lastly with the fruits. Fill 
up the mold with the remaining portion 
of the cream, cover closely, pack in 
broken ice and rock salt, and set to freeze 
for two hours. Just before serving have 
ready a vessel with warni water, lift the 
mold and wash off rapidly, being very 
careful to remove all salt and ice. Care- 
fully take the Macedoine of Fruits from 
the mold, turn into a cold dessert dish 
and serve immediately. 



CHAPTER XLn. 
FBUIT SYKUPS. CORDIALS, ETC. 



Des Sirops, des 
No book on Creole cookery would be 
complete without reference to those de- 
lightful fruit syrups which, under the 
names of "Sirops," "Ratafias," "Granits," 
etc., enter so largely Into the home and 
social life of the Creoles. Again, the 
ancient Creole housekeepers are famous 
for the delicious "Cordials" or "Liqueurs'" 
that they put up each year. Anisetto 
as grateful to the palate as that manu- 
factured by the famous French distil- 
leries is made at home by the Creoles, 
as also various kinds of domestic wines, 
than which a better quality could not 
be purchased from professional man- 
ufacturers. 

Before intering into a discussion of 
these "Sirops" and "Liqueurs," we will 
refer to the ancient custom the Creoles 
have of serving sweetened water after a 
hearty meal, and which, under the name 
of 

EAU SUCBEE. 
has been handed down from generation 
to generation as an integral part of the 
life of the Creole household. 

To one glass of fresh water allow one 
tablespoonful of sugar, or to a half glass 
allow a half tablespoonful; stir till the 
sugar is dissolved, and drink after a 
hearty meal. Every old Creole clings 
to his glass of "Eau Sucree." He claims 



Liqueurs, Etc. 

that this custom accounts for the sin- 
gular freedom that the Creoles, as a 
rule, enjoy from that distressing com- 
plaint, becoming so common in America 
— Dyspepsia. It is the rarest thing In 
the world to hear a Creole complain of 
any stomachic trouble, notwithstanding 
heavy dinners, numbers of courses, and 
richest viands and wines. The Eau Su 
cree is passed around the table at the 
close of the meal, and the children, as 
well as their elders, enjoy the drink. 

Again the "Eau Sucree" is used by 
all Creole mothers as a sedative for their 
little ones. Just before kissing her ba^ 
bies "Good-night," the Creole mother 
will give them a small glass of "Eau 
Sucree." It is claimed that it insures di- 
gestion and perfect sleep. 

STRUPS. 

Sirops. 

Under this heading are classed those 
delightful beverages of fruits or nuts, 
served by the Creole housewives during 
the summer season. Of a hot, sultry day, 
if you enter la well-regulated Creole 
household, the first thing Madame will 
do will be regale you with a glass 
of Lemonade, or "Iced Orgeat," or "Iced 
Pineapple," etc. The syrups are put up 



227 



and bottled by Madame herself, and are 
always at hand. 

General Directions for Making Syrnps. 

The Plain Syrup, that is the basis of all 
fruit syrups, is simply sugar and water 
boiled together in the proportion ot 
two pounds of sugar to a pint and a 
half of water. Cook the sugar and water 
till it forms the syrup called "L,e petit 
Casse" (see recipe under heading "Sugar 
as Employed in Candy-Making"), or 
crack, that is, cook it till it instantly 
snaps asunder when placed between the 
fingers after dipping them in cold water 
to enable one to test. Then add the 
Fruit Syrup, and nrtx thoroughly. Let 
It boil for about five minutes; take off 
the fire and let it get almost cold, then 
bottle very tight. This is the unvariable 
rule to be followed in making syrups of 
fruits. 

One quart of fruit when mashed and 
pressed will make a pint of Fruit Syrup, 
to be added to the Plain Syrup given 
above. 

Apricot Syrup.

12 Pints of Apricot Syrup. 

1 Gallon of Plain Syrup. 

1 Ounce of Essence of Apricots. 

Pare and stone the apricots, then cut 
them into pieces, pound and masli well 
and set them aside for thirty-six hours 
in a cool place. Then strain through a 
bag, pressing out all the juice. Cook 
the sugar and water till it forms the 
syrup called "Le Petit Casse." (See gen- 
eral directions for Making Syrups). Then 
add the apricot juice and mix thorough- 
ly; let it boil for five minutes, take 
off the fire, let it get almost cold, add 
the essence, and then bottle for use. 

Banana Syrup. 

Sirop de Bananes. 

2 Pints of Banana Juice. 
1 Gallon of Plain Syrup. 

1-8 Ounce of Banana Essence.

"Le Petit Casse," or crack (see recipe 
under chapter on Creole candies), that 
Is, till, it instantly snaps asunder when 
placed between the fingers, after dip- 



ping them in cold water, to enable you 
to test. Then add the fruit syrups and

wash, seed and dry the currants care- 
fully. Seed the cherries, and stem them 
and the raspberries, pound and mash 
them well, and let them stand for thirty- 
six hours in a cool place. Then strain 
through a bag. Cook the sugar and 
water till it forms the syrup called "Le

for Currant Syrup, and add the wine 
when you are about to bottle. 

Lemon Syrnp. 

Sirop de Citron. 

8 Ounces of Lemon Juice. 

15 Ounces of Sugar. 

1-2 Ounce of Extract of Lemon.

Sirop d'Orange. 

2 Quarts of Orange Juice. 
1 Gallon of Plain Syrup. 
1 Ounce of Lemon Juice. 

Proceed in exactly the same manner 
as for Lemon Syrup, and bottle when 
almost cold. This is a standing Creole 
Syrup. 

Orgeat Syrup. 

Sirop d'Orgeat. 

1 Pound of Sweet Almonds. 

4 Ounces of Bitter Almonds. 

2 Pounds of Sugar. 1 Quart of Water. 

2 Ounces of Orange Flower Water. 

The Zest of^a Lemon. 

r>o not throw the Almonds into hot 
water and blanch them, as in other 
recipes for almonds, but throw them into 
cold water, after shelling them, uTTlU 
the peeling or skin comes off easily. 
Then mash them and pound them in a 
mortar till they are reduced to a fine 
powder, adding, from time to time, a 
little water and the well-grated zest of 
the lemon. When this paste is perfectly 
made, moisten it with one-half of the 
water, and then squeeze it hard through 
a linen cloth, each end of which is held 
by some one, when you will have drained 
thoroughly of all milk. Then return the 
paste to the mortar, throw over the rest 
of the water, mix thoroughly, pounding 
well, and then squeeze again through 
the towel. Put the sugar into a farina 
boiler, and let it boil, to the degree of 
"Le Petit Casse," or crack, that is, till 
it forms a thich syrup that will not 
cling to the teeth in tasting, or instantly 
snaps asunder between the fingers after 
testing in cold water. Then take the 
syrup off the fire and add the milk 
of almonds, stirring well. Return it to 
the fire, and let it simmer gently until 
it begins to boil. Let it boil for several 
minutes. Then take it off the fire and let 
it cool. When cold, add the orange 
flower water, and mix well. Then drain 
all through a cloth or bag, and fill and 
seal the bottles. -' 

Orgeat, being made of the milk of 
almonds, easily decomposes or sours, be- 
cause the oil of almonds, being lighter 
than the other ingredients, rises to the 
top. For this reason, it is well to IooIt 
at the bottles frequently, and shake them 
daily. This will preserve the exact ming- 
ling of the mixture, and also preserve the 
Orgeat for use. 

Use only the finest white loaf sugar 
in making Orgeat Syrup. 

Peach Syrup. 

Sirop de Peches. 

2 Pints of Peach Juic«. 

1 Gallon of Plain Syrup. 

1-2 Ounce of Peach Essence. 



Pare and stone the peaches, then pound 
and mash well and set aside in a cool 
place for thirty-six hours. Strain 
through a bag, pressing out all the

manner as for Apricot Syrup, and add 
the essence as the syrup cools and you 
are about to bottle it. 

Pineapple Syrup. 
Sirop d'Ananas. 

2 Pints of Pineapple Juice. 
1 Gallon of Plain Syrup.

cool place. Then strain through a bag. 
Cook the sugar and water till it forms 
the syrup called "Le Petit (jasse," or 
crack, that is, till it instantly snaps asun- 
der when placed between the fingers, 
after dipping them in cold water, to 
enable you to test. Then add the fruit 
syrups, and mix thoroughly. Let it 
boil for about five minutes, take off 
the fire, let it get almost cold, and then 
put up in bottles.

operation and letting stand twenty-four 
hours three times. Then strain through 
a mustard bag, and add one pound of 
white sugar to every pint of the liquor, 
and boil the whole in a porcelain kettle 
for half an hour. When cold bottle it

CHAPTER XLIII. 
DOMESTIC WINES, CORDIAI-S AND DRINKS. 

Vins, Liqueurs et Boissons de Menage. 



Under this heading are comprised a 
great variety of fruits distilled in wine, 
or alcohol, or brandy, and sweetened or 
flavored with aromatic substances. These 
preparations are called according to their 
mode of preparation, "Ratafias," "Gran- 
its," "Liqueurs," or "Fruits a I'Eau-de- 
Vie." The Creoles always make their 
own anisettes, cordials and other liqueurs. 

RATAFIAS. 

These are pleasant beverages much 
affected by the Creoles, and are very 
easily prepared by the infusion of the 
juices of fruits or of the fruits them- 
selves, nuts and odorous flowers, in good 
French Brandy. To these are often add- 
ed various aromatic substances capable 
of imparting a delightful flavor to the 
liqueur. 

A Ratafia Liqueur is much more easily 
prepared than a cordial: the preparation 
requires far less time, and there is no 
necessity of a distilling apparatus. Our 
Louisiana fruits are very juicy, and. 



therefore, no other liquor than good 
French Brandy is or should ever be used 
in preparing a fruit Ratafia. The berries 
should always be well bruised, to ren- 
der the Ratafia aromatic, and the seeds 
should be well pounded. If flowers are 
used, thev should be just withered and 
steened. Water should be used very spar- 
ingly and only in sufficient quantity to 
aid in the diffusion and dissolving of the 

su2-ar. , . . . T 

The length of time that is required 
for the infusion must always be in pro- 
portion to the nature of the aroma. Gooa 
judgment must be the final test. If the 
infusion is too short, the flavor will be 
weak and sometimes insipid; if too long, 
you will have a bitter and acrid liquor. 

In order to separate the Ratafia, the 
liquor must be decanted after infusion 
and strained. It should always, however, 
be allowed to stand long enough to settle 
well before the Ratafia is bottled, or 
there will be a quick deposit of sediment, 
or the liquor will be turbid and murky. 



230 



All Ratafias must be bottled and very 
closely sealed. It is of the utmost im- 
portance that they be kept in cool, shady 
places, else the spirits will evaporate and 
the liqueur itself will slowly but surely 
decompose. 

Proportions of Ingredients for Batafia 
Liqueurs. 

In making Ratafias observe the fo-l 
lowing proportions in mixing the in- 
gredients: 

To three parts of the filtered juice of 
any kind of fruits or berries add one 
quart of feood old French Cognac, three 
pounds of white loaf sugar, clarified, 
with three pints of water, and a dessert- 
spoonful of Essence of Cloves, "Vanilla 
and Cinnamon. 

These should be thoroughly mixed and 
amalgamated ; then the Ratafia should 
be bottled and sealed and labeled. D > 
not use until the end of six months; 
twelve months' standing will produce a 
far finer cordial. The Creoles prepare 
their Christmas and New Tear cordials a 
year in advance, and also the Ratafias, 
which are served with crushed ice in 
summer. 

Use filtered Mississippi river water in 
making all cordials and Ratafias, and 
only the finest clarified white loaf sugar. 
How to Filter Cordials and Ratafias. 

The filtering Is of the utmost impor- 
tance. A good home-made filter may 
be improvised by fitting a piece of felt 
into a funnel, very closely. Some use 
flannel, but the felt is far better. Filter- 
ing paper is sold by all druggists. Put 
the funnel in the mouth of the bottle, 
fit in the paper, pour in the mixture and 
let It filter slowly. Again, others usd 
the ordinary brown or white paper, but 
this allows the aroma to escape, and 
the taste of the paper clings to the cor- 
dial. If you wish the cordial to be very 
transparent, take very dry, clear, trans- 
parent isinglass, and cut it very, very 
thin. Then dissolve it with White win3 
until it is perfectly liquid. Put it Into 
bottles and preserve for use. When need- 
ed, coat the inside of the strainer wifi 
this, using a light brush or sponge. It 
will form a glue around the funnel. Pour 
the cordial or liqueur through this, 
straining several times, again and again, 
until it becomes perfectly transparent. 
Strain it the last time into bottle, and 
seal very tight. Tou will then have a 
clear, limpid cordial or liqueur that will 
not have lost its aroma by evaporation. 

This simple method may be understood 
by even a child, and home-made cor- 
dials are not only very delightful, but 
far less expensive than the imported ones. 
Always have the Cognac as old as pos- 
sible.

FRUIT WATERS. 

Eau de Fruits Glaces. 

These are famous Creole summer bev- 
erages, and are always served to friends 
when visiting of an evening, or at eve- 
ning receptions and reunions in summer. 
They are made, for the most part, of 
fruit juices and syrups, but they are also 
made of different kinds of punch, and 
from coffee. 

The Orangeade, the Orgeat and tha 
Lemonade, with the Claret Cup, are the 
principal. Unlike the Ratafias, they are 
served soon after concoction. In freez- 
ing, the Creoles put the mixture into 
water bottles or earthen jugs. These are 
set on ice and twirled arooind. As the 
contents become frozen a wooden spatula 
is thrust into the jar for the purpose nf 
scraping down the portion that is froze'i 
into the liquid center.

LEMONABE. 
Limonade. 

Lemonade is among the most delight- 
ful and most commonly used of all fruit 
waters. There are few homes in New 
Orleans in which it is not a standing 
offering for family use and for visitors 
during the hours of the long summer 
day. Lemonade is always served very 
cold in summer, but there is a hot lem- 



232 



onade, which is extensively used by the 
Creoles during winter days for various 
purposes, mostly medicinal. 

Iced Lemonade. 

Limonade Glacee, 

1 Dozen Lemons. 1 Pound of Sugar. 
2 Quarts of Water. Cracked Ice.

lemons. Rasp the rind with white, 
crushed sugar, in order to extract tho 
fine aromatic oil that lurks in the zest. 
Then squeeze the juice of the lemon, 
and strain it, and add the sugar and the 
necessary quantity of water. In making 
lemonade never use the rinds of the 
lemons, except to slice one daintily and 
place in the glass when about to serve 
the lemonade. The rind simply put in o 
the lemonade does not add to the 
strength, but imparts a bitter and often 
disagreeable flavor. Extract the fine oils 
in the rind by rasping, as indicated, on 
crushed sugar. In making cold lemonade 
for six persons, allow six ounces of sugar 
to five lemons, and one quart of water. 
Increase the quantity in proportion to 
number to be served. Serve with crushed 
ice. 

Hot Lemonade.

sometimes boil the lemons when used for 
medicinal purposes.

dozen fine, large strawberries, and dec- 
orate with slices of pineapple and lemon 
sliced very thin. In case there is no'; 
sufficient sugar, sweeten again to taste. 
Put a large piece of ice in the bowl. 
When ready to sterve, fill glasses one-

Then pour it on the sliced orange. Let 
it stand for a few minutes, and it is 
ready to use. Strain if you desire. 

CREAM SYRUPS. 

Sirops a la Creme. 

Cream Syrups are distinctively French, 
and were introduced into America by the 
French settlers of Louisiana. The early 
Creole Settlers of New Orleans applied

FRUIT GBANITS. 

Fruit Juice Granits. 
Des Granits. 
All manner of summer fruit beverages 
which have been given in this chapter, or 
which will be given, may be served as 
"Granits," by simply freezing them ac- 
cording to the recipes given above. 

A Granit is only half frozen, tho 
thought being to make it resemble snow- 
frosted water; it must always be suffi- 
ciently liquid to admit of being poured 
out into glasses and passed around to 
guests. The liquid may also be frozen In 
a freezer, but the Creoles cling to the old- 
fashioned water jugs. 

Granits are favorite drinks in France, 
the custom having been adopted from the 
Italians, who served them under the name 
of "Granitii." 

The Granits which are extemporized 
from fruits are the most delightful of all 
but they must be used at once, or they 
will become insipid, when not made into 
Ratafias or Liqueurs. The following re- 
cipe for Orange Granit will serve for 
almost any kind of Fruit Granit:

quarts. Add the sugar, allowing one glass 
of sugar always to two glasses of black- 
berries, if you wish to m.ake larger 
quantities than the above measurements. 
Add the cloves and the allspice, and 
set on the fire, and let it come to a 
good boil. Let it boil up several times. 
Then take off, strain and add the brandy. 
Bottle while hot. Cork well and seal, 
and set away in a cool place, to be used

large glass bottle or vessel that can be 
closed tightly, and pour over the brandy. 
Shake well and let it stand for fifteen 
days, each day shaking the bottle well, 
to agitate the juices. Make a syrup 
with the sugar and water, .first beating 
into the sugar the whites of two eggs, 
to make the infusion very clear. Then 
mix witii the water and strain. Add It 
to the syrup of brandy and lemons, bot- 
tle and cork well. Shake the bottlts 
and let them stand for fifteen days lon- 
ger, agitating each day. At the end of 
this time filter the liquor and bottle 
tightly for use. 

A more simple Curacoa, but not so 
excellent, is made by taking the zest of 
one dozen oranges, three-quarters of a 
dram of cinnamon and one-quarter of 
a dram of mace. Blend these well 
together, and steep in three pints of al- 
cohol for fifteen days. Then distill in

Blackberry Wine 

, Vin de Mures. 

4 Quarts of Currant Juice. 
„ 11-3 Quarts of Cold Water. 
3 Pounds of Granulated Sugar. 

Mix all the above ingredients well to- 
gether, and then let them stand for 
twenty-four hours, having, of course, ob- 
tained the currant juice by cleanly pick- 
ing, washing and drying and pressing 
the berries. Then let it stand lor tw5 
days. After this skim well, and set In a 
cool place to ferment slowly for at least 
SIX days. At the end of this time remove 
any froth that has collected, and add a 
half teacupful of the best French Brandy, 
and close tightly. In two days, when 
it is well settled, draw off, without dis- 
turbing the sediment, and bottle tightly 
and seal. This wine improves with age 
Always have the bottles very clean and 
dry before bottling, and if larger propor- 
tions are used and a cask is necessary, 
remember that an old cask is more desir- 
able than a new one, on account of the 
taste of the wood, and that the cask must 
be perfectly fresh and sweet-smelling, or 
ine wine will sour. 

Currant Wine. 

Vin de Groseilles. 

4 Quarts of Currant Juice. 

1 1-3 Quarts of Cold Water. 

3 Pounds of Granulated Sugar. 

Prepare in exactly the same manner a^f 
Blackberry Wine. 

[Elderberry Wine. 

Vin de Fleurs de Sureau. 

1 Peck of Elderberries. 
2 1-2 Gallons of Water. 

1-4 Pound of Sugar. 
1-2 Pint of Hop Yeast. 

Bruise the Elderberries, and then dilute 
with the water and boil for ten minutes. 
Then strain well and press out the juice 
from the berries. Measure the whole, 
and add the sugar, and, while half warm, 
the yeast. Let the whole ferment for ten 
days. Then cork well. After three month* 
draw off the wine and bottle for use. 



240 > 



In making large quantities of this wine, 
which is used by the Creoles for many 
medicinal purposes, allow four pecks of 
elderberries to every ten gallons of wa- 
ter, and to every quart three-quarters of 
a pound of sugar and a half pint of 
yeast. 

Muscadine Wine. 
Vin de Muscades. 

4 Quarts of Muscadine Juice. 

1 1-3 Quarts of Cold Water. 

,3 Pounds of Granulated Sugar. 

Prepare in exactly the same manner a.' 
Blackberry Wine. 

XfOuisiana Orange Wine. 

Vin d'Oranges de la Liouisiane. 

3 Pounds of Sugar to Every Gallon of 

Juice. 

1-3 of a Gallon of Water. 

The White of 1 Egg. 

1 Cake of Compressed Yeast. 

Take fine Louisiana oranges, and was^i 
tjiem well. Then dry with a cloth, an.l 
peel off the yellow outer rind very, very 
thin, and strain all the juice through a 
hair sieve, three pounds of granulated 
sugar, the white and shell of one egg, to 
clarify, and one-third of a gallon of wa ■ 
ter. Put the sugar, the crushed eggshell 
and white of the egg, beaten to a froth, 
in a pcrcelain-lined saucepan, and add 
the water, and boil to a syrup, stirring 
constantly to prevent the egg from hard- 
ening. Let the syrup boil till it looks 
clear when seen through the froth of the 
egg, which will rise to the srrface. Then 
strain the syrup, and pour it over the 
grated orange zest, and let it stand for 
twenty-four hours. Then add the orange 
juice, and strain, and put it into a cask 
with a small cake cf compressed yeast, 
allowing half a cake to five gallons of 
wine. Close tightly, but leave the bung 
out of the cask until the wine ceases to 
ferment. As long as fermentation is pro- 
gressing there will be a hissing sound. 
When this ceases the fermentation has 
ceased. Then add a glass of good Brandy 
for each gallon of Wine, close the cask, 
drive in the bung, and let the wine stand 
for at least nine months. Then bottle 
It, and about four months after it has 
been bottled it will be ready for use. This 
is an excellent Louisiana wine, and can 
be made with little expense. 

Scuppernong Wine. 

Vin de Muscades. 

4 Quarts of Scuppernong Juice. 

1 1-3 Quarts of Cold Water. 
3 Pounds of Granulated Sugar.

BOOT BEER. 

Biere Creole. 

1-2 Pint of Root Beer Extract (Hire's 

Solution). 

10 Pounds of Sugar. 

10 Gallons of Lukewarm, Filtered Mis- 
sissippi River Water. 



1 Pint of Yeast, or 1 1-2 Cakes of Com- 
pressed Yeast. 

Dissolve the sugar thoroughly in the 
water, and then add the Root Beer Ex- 
tract and the yeast. If you use the cake 
yeast, dissolve it first in a little water, 
so that it will mix well with the beer. 
Stir until thoroughly mixed, and then 
bottle in strong bottles or in jugs, cork- 
ing and tying the corks very securely, 
so that the gas may not escape from the 
solution. Then set the beer away in a 
place of even temperature. It will be 
ready for use in twenty-four hours after 
bottling, or even ten, but will be far more 
effervescing if allowed to stand three or 
tour days. Always place the bottle on 
ice or in a very cool place just before 
opening it, if you wish it to be cod), 
sparkling and delicious. 

SPBUCE BEER. 

Biere de Sapin. 

Take sprigs of spruce and boil until 
you have an ounce of strong essence. 
Take one ounce of hops and a spoonful 
of ginger, and put them into a gallon of 
water. When well boiled strain the mix- 
ture, and add a pint of lH)ulsiana Mo- 
lasses or a pound of brown sugar, an.3 
then add the extract of Spruce. Whe,i 
cool add a teacupful of yeast (home- 
made), and put all into a clean, tight 
cask, and let it ferment for twenty-four 
hours or two days. Then bottle for use. 
Essence of Spruce may be purchased and 
used instead of the sprigs of spruce, or 
the Spruce Gum may be boiled. The Cre- 
oles always use the sprigs, or spruce bark 
rich with gum.

Bruise and pound the ginger well, anfl 
put it into a bowl with the boiling water. 
Add the juice of a lemon and the well- 
grated zest. Add the Cream of Tartar 
and the sugar, mixing and stirring con- 
stantly. When it is lukewarm add the 
yeast, dissolved in a little water. Mix 
well and cover tightly, and let it stand 
for six hours. Then strain it and put It 
Into bottles with patent tops and keep Ic 
a cool place. It effer\-esces rapidly if not 
kept most securely corked. 

DOMESTIC BEVER.4GES. 
Boissons de Menage. 
Under the heading of "Domestic Bev- 
erages" might properly be classed Coffee, 
Tea, Chocolate and Cocoa, daily drinks 
in almost every Creole household. 
TE.V. 
Du The. 
Tea has a stimulating and grateful 
effect when not taken in excess, and pro- 
motes digestion. 

The Creoles use most exclusively th« 
black and green tea mixed, preferring the 
flavor always of the Hyson, Oolong, Bo- 
hea. Gunpowder or Heno. Like Coffee, 
Tea should never be boiled. It should al- 
ways be made from fresh boiling watpr, 
and never in any but an earthen or a^ate 
teapot. Tea made in earthen tea urn<! 
requires longer to draw than if made in 
bright metal pots. Tea should never be 
suffered to stand long, as it acquires an 
unpleasant taste and loses its delightful 
aroma and fragrance. 



241 



The spout of the teapot should always 
be closed by a cover, secured by a chain, 
to prevent the escape of the aroma, an.l 
the urn itself should be closed at the 
top with a tightly-fitting cover. 

To make good tea, first see that the 
teapot, is perfectly clean. Then pour boil- 
ing water into it, and let it stand for 
five minutes, so that the metal or earthen 
urn may become thoroughly heated. Then 
throw out this water, a nd drain the urn 
well. Allow a teaspoonful of tea for 
each cup of boiling water, or, if you de- 
sire stronger tea, allow two teaspoonfuis. 
Put this tea into the hot pot, and pour 
over one pint of boiling water, if you 
wish to make a quart, or, according ti> 
the quantity desired, one-half a cup oi: 
water to each cup. L.et this solution 
draw for five minutes in front, not on 
top, the stove or range, as tea that has 
the least indication of boiling is con- 
demned by the best ethics of Creole Cook- 
erv. After five minutes add the other 
pint of water, or water in proportion ^o 
the number of cups desired, allowing a 
half cup more for each person. Serve at 
once, very hot. 

In serving the tea, put the cream or 
milk or sugar into the cups. The milk 
should be cold and unboiled, as the 
boiled milk destroys the flavor of the 
tea. Cream is far preferable to milk. 
Have the tea very hot, and pour over 
the milk, allowing twc teaspoonfuis or 
four of milk to each person, or suiting 
individual tastes. 

Always have a pitcher of very hot wa- 
ter at hand when about to serve the tea 
Pour a little into each cup to warm it, 
and then empty before putting in the 
milk and tea. Pour the tea through n 
strainer, so as to avoid the possibility of 
leaves or dregs passing into the cup. 



The tea leaves that have been infused 
in an earthen teapot may be used- again, 
as all the aroma has not been extracted 
by the first infusion. The tea brewed in 
a metal pot must never be used a sf^nnn'^ 
time, as by standing it absorbs tne acid 
of the tin. Indeed, metal teapots are cor- 
demned by the best Creole housekeepers. 

CHOCOLATE. 

Du Chocolat. 

1 Cake of Srated French or German 

Chocolate. 

1 Quart of New Milk. 

Set the milk to boil; in the meantime 
mix the grated chocolate with a little hot 
water, to blend thoroughly. Stir this in 
the milk as it begins to simmer, and let 
it boil up once, and serve hot, each one 
sweetening to taste, or allow two table- 
spoonfuls of sugar to the entire mixture. 
Serve hot, with or without Whipped 
Cream. 

It is a mistake to allow chocolate to 
boil a long time. The basis of Chocolate 
is sugar and cocoa, and the first gains 
nothing by boiling, and the second loses 
its fragrant perfume by evaporation. 

In economical households one-half a 
cup of water is sometimes allowed to 
three-"uarters of a cup of milk in mak- 
ing Chocolate. 

COCOA. 

Du Cacao. 

1 Quart of Milk. 
4 Tablespoonfuls of Cc-coa. 

Set the milk to boil in a farina boiler, 
and moisten the Cocoa with a little milk, 
and pour it into the milk just as it begins 
to simmer, stirring all the while. Let it 
boil up once, and serve hot, with or 
without "Whipped Cream. 



CHAPTER XLIV. 
JSLLIES, MARMALADES, PKBSEBVES. 

Des Confitures, des Marmalades et des Conserves. . 



In making jellies, marmalades or pre- 
serves, use only perfectly sound and fresh 
fruit. Do not cook them long enough to 
destroy their natural flavor, and seal 
them while boiling hot in airtight jars, 
and be careful to fill these even to over- 
flowing, so as to preclude the possibility 
of the least air entering the bottle. Then 
seal quickly. Heat the jars before filling, 
and use a wide-mouthed funnel during 
tlie process of filling. The large-mouthed 
jars that now come with porcelain-lined 
glass tops are the best. When once the 
jars are filled, immediately screw on th? 
tops, and put them in a dry, warm olace, 
where there is not the least possibility of 
the air striking them. After twenty-four 
hours turn the tops on still more tightly, 
so as to be sure to exclude the entrance 
of all air, and set them away in a cool, 
dark storeroom or closet. The room must 
not be cold. After six days examine ih'i 
jars carefully. If there is not the least 
si"-" of any air bubbles O'n the surface, 
and the liquid seems to have settled per- 
fectly, the fruit is keeping properly. If, 
on the contrary, there is the least sign 
of an air bubble, the fruit is beginning 
to ferment, and if the bottle is not opened 
. immediately- it will burst shortly. Take 
out the fruit, recork it, and prepare the 
jars again, and return the fruit to them, 
takingr extra precautions to prevent the 
entrance of any particle of air. In pre- 
serving large fruits, always throw them 



into cC'ld water as soon as they have 
been pared. Then have ready a pot of 
clear, boiling syrup and proceed as di- 
rected below. 

Use all surplus juices that exude from 
berries to make jellies. 

Never make preserves on a damp, rainy 
day, and never use fruits that are over- 
ripe, or that have been picked in wet 
weather- They will sour. 

Always have the jars exposed several 
days in the air in a dry place, so that 
they may be perfectly dry. 

In all cases the jars must be entirely 
full, so as to leave no room for air, and 
must be sealed as hot as possible. 

Set the jars in warm water before fill- 
ing^ and let them gradually heat before 
introducing the hot preserves else they 
will crack- 
Let all bubbles rise to the top, and if 
you see any in the lower part of the jar, 
insert a silver fork, which will cause 
them to rush to the top. Then have 
ready a strong piece of muslin, large 
enough to tie over the mouth, and with 
a spoon spread over a thick co'at of ce- 
ment made of one pound of rosin and 
two ounces of mutton suet, well mixed 
and melted. Take up the cover quickly, 
place it on the jar, with the cement side 
downward, and press it down closely over 



242 



the sides. Tie It down with twine, and 
finish with a good coat of cement over 
the whole. Set the jars in a large pan 
of hot water, to cool gradually, on no ac- 
count attempting to cool them out of 
the water or they will crack. When 
they are cold the tops will be found 
sunken in. This may be taken as an 
evidence that all the air has been ex- 
cluded most effectually. The regular fruit 
Jars, made fo-r preserving, do not require 
any muslin, as the lids are tight-fitting. 
But pour the cement around the groove 
in the top, so as to seal tightly. 

If tin cans are used, it will be neces- 
sary to have a man ready at hand to 
solder up the can as soon as full. 

If open jars are used, cover first with 
brandied paper, and then with white na- 
per, fastened on with a thick flour paste. 
Liabel and set the jars away. 

These directions for sealing will hold 
in making all preserves, marmalades and 
jellies. Fruit put up in this manner will 
rarely spoil. The one great thing to be 
remembered is to expel all air. 

Apple Jelly. 

Gelee de Pommes. 
1 Pound of Sugar to Every Pint of Juice. 

Take pippins or other tart apples, pare 
them and cut into quarters, put Into a 
preserving kettle, cover with water, and 
add the grated rind of a lemon, and lot 
them boil to a marmalade. Then strain 
the juice, without squeezing, through a 
clean jelly bag made of flannel, and for 
every pint of juice add one pound of fine 
sugar. If the apples are not very tart, 
add the juice also. 

Apricot Jelly. 
Gelee d'Abricots. 

To Every Pint of Fruit Juice 1 Pound of 
Sugar. 

Choose apricots that are just ripe, and 
no more. Pare and cut In two, and take 
out the stones. Boil them in water suf- 
ficient to cover well, strain through a 
hair sieve, and pour the decoction into 
earthen dishes. To every pint of liquid 
add a pound of sugar. Set on the fire, 
let it boil twenty minutes, skimmlnE^ 
while on the fire. Pour immediately into 
cups, glasses or preserve jars, and pro- 
ceed to seal as directed above. This Jelly 
has a most exquisite flavor if the grated 
rind of an orange is added. 

To make apricot juice, after pressing 
out the juice put into glass bottles, and 
add one pound of powdered sugar to 
every pound of juice, and a little cinna- 
mon. Shake the bottle well, until the 
sugar is melted. Let it stand eight days. 
Then filter the juice, pour it into bottles, 
fasten securely, and keep in a cool placf. 

Cherry juice and all fruit juices are 
prepared in the same manner. 
Blackberry Jelly. 
Gelee de Mures. 

1 Pound of Blackberries. 1 Pound of 
Sugar. 

To every pound of blackberries allow 
a half pound of sugar. Put the berries 
In a porcelain-lined kettle, and cover 
them with the sugar and let them stand 
for two hours. Then set over a moderate 
fire and bring the mixture to the boillnn 
point. Skim while boiling; pour Imme- 
diately into cups and glasses, and cover 
tightly and place in a cool, dry place. 

For Strawberry and Blackberry Jelly 
combined, allow equal parts of the fruits 
and proceed as above. 



Blue Plum and Damson Jelly. 

Gelee de Prunes. 

1 Pound of Fruit. 

3-4 of a Pound of Sugar. 

Stone the fruit, whether damsons or 

plums, and allow three-quarters of a 

pound of sugar to every pound of fruit. 

Proceed in exactly the same manner as 

for Blackberry Jelly. 

Calf's Foot Jelly. 

Gelee de Pieds de Veau. 

S'ee recipe under chapter on Compotes. 

Cherry Jelly. 

Gelee de Cerises. 

1 Pound of Cherries. 
1-2 Pound of Sugar. 

Stone the cherries and allow half a 
pound of sugar to every pound of cher- 
ries if the cherries are ripe and sour, 
and a quarter of a pound otherwise. Set 
over the fire until the heat causes the 
juice to flow freely, and proceed in ex- 
actly the same manner as for Strawberry 
or Blackberry Jelly. 

Currant Jelly. 

Gelee de Groseilles. 

To Every Pint of Juice 1 Pound of Sugar. 

Take currants that are fully ripe; 
clean, pick, wash and boll. To everv pint 
of juice add one pound of fine white 
sugar. Let it boil for twenty minutes, 
always skimming it while on the fire. 
Do not let it remain longer than twenty 
minutes, or It will grow dark. Pour Im- 
mediately into cups. 

Some boil the currants without the 
sugar, and then, for every pint of juice, 
after taking off the fire, they add the 
sugar In the proportions given, stirring 
briskly till all is absorbed and dissolved, 
then the jars are filled as quickly as 
possible, for the preparation jellies at 
once. 

Jellies made in this way are of much 
lighter color than when the sugar Is 
boiled into them. 

Currant and Raspberry Jelly. 

Gelee de Groseilles Framboisee. 

1 Pound of Sugar. 

1 Pint of Fruit Juice. 

Take equal parts of currants and rasp- 
uerries and strain the juice, and proceed 
as above, allowing one pound of sugar to 
every pint of berry juice. 

To every quart of large red raspberries 
allow a half pint of currant juice; place 
in a kettle, add the sugar and bring to 
a boil, and proceed as directed above. 

Lemon Jelly. 

Gelee de Citron. 
4 Lemons. 1-2 Can of Gelatine. 
1 Quart of Water.

(see Calf's Foot Jelly) — in one quart of 
water, and. when reduced to one-half the 
quantity, add the juice and sugar; set all 
to boil on a very hot coal fire^ and then 
Dour immediately into a glass or porce- 
lain dish; fill the glasses and set in a 
cool place.

Orangre Jelly, Creole Style. 

Gelee a I'Orange a la Creole. 

6 Louisiana Oranges. 

1-2 Box of Gelatine. 1-2 Gill of Curaooa. 

Sugar to Taste. 

Extract the juice of the oranges. Soak 
the gelatine, if prepared, and set the 
bowl in boiling water till the gelatine 
melts. Then add the juice of the orange, 
and add sugar to taste. Add a wine- 
glassful of the best Curacoa, and strain 
the jelly through a coarse piece of Swiss. 
Set in a mold to harden. 

The Creoles have a pretty way of mak- 
ing baskets out of the oranges and serv- 
ing the jelly in them. Every little Creole 
child knows how to make these baskets. 
With a sharp knife they trace out a bas- 
ket in the skin of the orange, and then 
gradually loiasening the pulp, they out 
out the orange, without breaking the 
skin. The orange meat is then used for 
the jelly, and the baskets are thrown into 
ice water for an hour. This makes them 
stiff. When the jelly is hard, it is cut 
into little squares, and gradually made to 
fit, like blocks, into the baskets. These 
baskets are placed in a dish, beautifully 
garnished with delicate buds and green- 
ery, and the effect ia very charming. 
Again, the oranges are cut open in tliig 
manner. The peel is marked off into 
eighths and pulled from the upper end 
of the stem, without separating the 
orange peels, -which open like a beauti- 
ful flower. The jelly is piled into this 
■when cool, whipped cream is heaped on 
the top, a few luscious strawberries are 
placed in the cream, and this is. not only 
a most beautiful picture on the table, bat 
a delicious dessert. Try it.

JAMS. 
Des Marmelades. 

Marmalades are a mixture of fruits 
that have been reduced to a paste of such 
consistency that they may be preserved. 
Ripe fruits, which cannot bear the 
process of blanching required in preserv- 
ing whole fruits are used for this pur- 
pose. Tlie beauty and the taste of a 
marmalade will depend on the fruits that 
are used and the quality of sugar, as also 
the care bestO'wed on the preparation. 
The Creoles, like their ITrench ancestors, 
are noted for their delightful ^irepara- 
tions of marmalades. 

Directions for Making a Marmalade. 

Always choose ripe, beautiful, luscious 
fruit. Cut the fruit into small nieces, 
and then add the sugar and fruit in al- 
ternate layers in the preserving kettle, 
with a layer of fruit on the bottom. Set 
the kettle over the fire. If the fruit ia 
not very juicy add a small quantity of 
water to set it to boiling and to extract 
the juices. As the fruit boils, shako the 
kettle occasionally by lifting it from the 
fire, and turn the whole briskly to pre- 
vent it from burning at the bottom. 
Never stir with a spoon, as it will be 
sure to burn. When the whole mixture 
begins to look very clear, and you see, 
by testing a portion on a plate, that it Is 
growing thick, it is done. Then take 
from the fire and put into jars at once. 
This mode of cooking distinguishes the 
marmalade from preserves an_d jellies. 

Follow these directions implicitly in th» 
subjoined recipes:

General Directions for Making 

Preserves. 

Preserving fruits is very much on the 
same order as the making of Jellies, only 
in preserving equal quantities of fruit 
and sugar are used. Use only the best 
quality of sugar. 

Fruits may be preserved either whole 
or otherwise. In preserving fruits whole, 
it is best to prick such fruits as pears, 
plums and peaches with a needle, so as 
to give vent to the juice, which would 
otherwise escape and burst the skin. This 
mode of preserving looks very beautiful, 
but the best way is the old-fashioned 
one of paring the fruit carefully, either 
in halves or whole, simply removing the 
skins and cores. Then make a syrup of 
one pound of white sugar to each pound 
of fruit. Set the kettle on the fire, and 
let the syrup boil till the fruit looks quite 
clear. Or make the syrup by putting it 
on the fire with water, allowing a half 
pint of fresh water to a pound of the 
best white sugar. Stir well and brine 
to a boil Let it boil five ininutes, when 
it will begin to bubble and froth. As 
the froth rises the syrup will become 
clear. Skim and set to one side of the 
stove to settle, and it is now ready to 
receive the fruit. , , , 

If the former method is used, take the 
fruit carefully out of the syrup as soon 
as possible, so as to take up as little 
of the syrup as can be helped, and then 
place the fruit in the jars. Let the syrup 
continue to boil till it becomes very thicc, 
and inclined to run into a jelly. Then 
fill the jars up with it, and when cool 
tie with muslin or paper around the 
mouth before sealing. But the new jars 
that come with close-fitting covers are 
the best, as well as the most economical 
finally. 

Use in preference a porcelam-lmed ket- 
tle If you use a copper kettle, never 
allow the preserves, jams or marmalades 
to cool in the kettle, on account of the 
virdigris which will be sure to form. 

Examine the preserves from time to 
time, and change the paper covers when 
they are discolored. , , , , 

If the slightest sign of air bubbles is 
detected, open the jars immediately and 
boil the fruit again, but this will also 



destroy some of the flavor and excellent 
quality. 

It is absolutely necessary to keep all 
preserves, marmalades and jellies in a 
cool (not cold) place, that is, perfectly 
free from dampness or possibility of heat. 
Heat will excite fermentation, and the 
preserves will quickly sour. Dampness 
will cause them to decompose and mold. 

Follow implicitly the above directions, 
and you will be sure to succeed in mail- 
ing preserves, etc. 

Fig: Preserves. 

Take the weight in sugar of the quan- 
tity of figs to be preserved; the figs 
must be ripe. Cover the figs with cold 
water for twelve hours; then simmer in 
water enough to cover them until ten- 
der, and spread out upon a sieve to cool 
and harden. Make a syrup of the sugar, 
a cup of cold water being allowed for 
every pound. Boil until clear of scum, 
put in the figs, and simmer for ten mi.i- 
utes. Take them out and spread upon 
the dishes in the sun. Add the lemons 
and the ginger; boil the syrup thick, give 
the figs another boil of fifteen mnutes 
and fill the jars three-quarters of the 
way up to the top. Then fill up with 
boiling syrup, cover, and, when cold, 
seal up. 

Lemon Preserves. 
Conserve de Citron. 

1 Pound of Sugar for Every Pound of 

Lemons. 
The Juice of 1 Lemon for Every Poun'i 

of Fruit. 
A Tablespoonful of Alum for Bveiy 
Quart of Water. 
Cut the lemon in halves, after paring, 
and remo've the seeds. Then cut it up 
into a number of thin slices, and put 
them into a vessel with cold water, add- 
ing a tablespoonful of alum to every 
quart of water, or a little salt. After 
several hours put the lemon into cool, 
fresh water, and let it remain an hour, 
and drain. Then put it into a kettle and 
cover with two quarts of boiling water. 
Add the rinds of the lemon or citron, 
and a few pieces of ginger root. Let all 
boil till perfectly clear. Then take out 
the fruit and drain dry. Then prepare a 
syrup, allowing one pound of sugar for 
every pound of fruit, and add the juice 
of a lemon for each pound of fruit. Put 
the citron or lemon in without the gin- 
ger and allow it to boil for three-quar- 
ters of an hour. It will become a beau- 
tiful, clear amber color. Proceed to bot- 
tle or seal in jars immediately. 
Peach Preserves. 
Conserves de Peches. 

To Every Pound of Fruit One Pound of 
Sugar; 

Prepare the syrup as above directed. 
Then peel the peaches and cut them into 
halves, removing the stones. Skim the 
syrup and drop in the peaches, one at a 
time and let them boil till tender, from 
fifteen to twenty minutes. They should 
be so tender that they may be pierced 
with a broom straw. This is the test. 
Then remove the kettle from the fire, 
carefully drain out the peaches and put 
them in the jars. Then boil the syrup 
twenty minutes longer, or until it forma 
a thick syrup, removing the scum as it 
rises. Pour off any remains of thin syrup 
that may have adhered to the peaches 
in the jar, and fill in with the syrup, and 
set aside to cool. When cold, screw the 
tops of the jars on. Label and set away.

CHAPTER XLV. 
CREOLK CANDIES. 



Bonbons et Sucreries Creoles. 



Creole Candies occupy a unique posi- 
tion among confections In the United 
States, and it has often been said that 
the old French Quarter could apply for a 
patent for its delicious "Pacanes a la 



Creme." "Praline Blanc," 'Pistaches Pra- 
linees, "La Colle," "Mais Tactac,' 
"Dragees," "Guimauves," "Pastilles," 
"Nougats" and other exclusive products 
of the Creole cuisine. The term "Pra- 
line" is not of Creole origin, being a com- 
mon enough word in the vocabulary of 
the French nation, with the mother coun- 
try of Louisiana it simply means "su- 



gared," and has no reference whatever 
to the delightful confections that had 
their origin in the old Creole homes of 
New Orleans. There is, indeed, a tradi- 
tional recipe of the great Viart, "Homme 
de Bouche," as he called himself, who 
tickled the palate of Charles X, in the 
jocund days of the Bourbon restoration, 
and another old tradition that the Praline 
was a species of Dragee, which derived 
its name from the Marechal de Plessin- 
Pralin, who was very fond of almonds, 
and whose butler one day advised him 
to have them coated with sugar to avoid 



247 



indigestion. Again, there is an old French 
rhyme of Gresset's which has become in- 
corporated in the banquette games of the 
littie Creole children of New Orleans, 
and which runs thus: 

"Soeur Rosalie au retour de matlnes, 
Plus d'une fois lui porta des pralines." 

But all these songs and stories simply 
refer to any sugar-coated 'nut. It was 
reserved for the gentle descendants of 
these old French ancestral homes to 
evolve from the suggestiveness of the 
word "Praline" dainty and delightful con- 
fections that have, for upwards of one 
hundred and fifty years, delighted the 
younger generations of New Orleans, and 
the older ones, too. 

White PrallneB. 

Pralines Blanches de Coco. 
1 Pound of Fine White Sugar (Granu- 
lated). 
1 Freshly-Grated Cocoanut (Small Size). 

4 Tablespoonfuls of Water. 

Use a farina boiler or a porcelain-lined 
saucepan. Put the sugar in the sauce- 
pan with the water and let it boll well. 
When it begins to form a syrup, take 
from the fire and stir in the freshly- 
grated cocoanut. Mix thoroughly and re- 
turn to the fire, and let It boil until you 
can draw it like a thread between your 
finger and thumb. Be careful to stir 
constantly from the time you add the 
cocoanut. When it begins to bubble, take 
from the stove, for it will have reached 
the above-mentioned state in two or three 
minutes. This will be sufficient if you 
wish the praline to be light and flaVy. 
Have ready a cleanly washed and some- 
what wet marble slab or buttered dish. 
Take a kitchen spoon and drop the mix- 
ture into cakes on the slab, spreading 
them out with the spoon and rounding 
with a fork till they form a neat round 
cake of about a quarter of an inch in 
thickness and four or five inches in di 
ameter. Let them dry; and then take a 
knife and gently raise them from the 
slab. Tou will have the - dainty while 
pralines that are such peculiar Creole 
confections and which are also much 
sought after by strangers visiting New 

Increase the quantity of sugar in pro- 
portion to the size of the cocoanut, using 
three pounds of finest white sugar for a 
very large cocoanut, and never boil the 
cocoanut more than a few minutes in the 
sugar. 

Fink Pralines. 
Pralines Rose de Coco. 

1 Pound of Fine WTiite Sugar (Granu- 
lated) . 
1 Freshly-Grated Cocoanut (Small Size). 
4 Tablespoonfuls of Water. 
1 Tablespoonful of Cochineal. 

Proceed in exactly the same mailner 
as above, only add about a tablespoonful 
of Cochineal to the pralines. Just before 
taking oft the fire. Proceed to drop on a 
marble slab, as above. 

Pecan Pralines. 
Pralines aux Pacanes. 

1 Pound of Brown Sugar. 

1-2 Pound of Freshly-Peeled and Cut 

Louisiana Pecans. 

1 Spoon of Butter. 

4 Tablespoonfuls of Water. 

Set the sugar to boil, and as it begins 
to boil add the pecans, which you will 
have divested of their shells, and cut 



some into fine pieces, others into halves 
and others again into demi-halves. L'3t 
all boil till the mixture begins to bubble, 
and then take off the stove and proceed 
to lay on a marble slab, as above, to dry. 
These pecan pralines are delicious. 

Be careful to stir the mixture in the 
above recipe constantly till the syrup 
begins to thicken and turn to sugar. Then 
take from the stove and proceed to turn 
on the marble slab. One pound of un- 
shelled pecans will make a half pound 
shelled. In using water, add just suffi- 
cient to melt the sugar. 

Cream Pecans. 

Pacanes a la Creme. 

1 Pound of Pecans. 

The White of an Egg. 

1-4 Pound of Finest White Confectionery 

Sugar. 

Under this suggestive term is known a 
species of confection that is much used 
by the Creole as an addition to the most 
fashionable and recherche feast, i-eel the 
pecans in halves, being careful not to 
break the meat. Then take the white of 
an egg and beat well with its weight in 
water till it forms a cream. Then wOTi 
in with your fingers the finest white con- 
fectionery sugar till it forms a smooth 
paste. Take a small piece of this paste, 
roll it, and put it between two halves of 
the pecans, and then lightly roll in the 
paste, flattening the pecan somewhaL 
The coating outside must be very, very 
light, so that the delicate brown of the 
pecan meat shows through. Set the pe- 
cans to dry, and serve on dainty china 
saucers, setting a saucer to each guest. 

Almond Pralines. 

Amandes Pralinees. 

1 Pound of Beautiful New Almonds. 

1 Pound of Sugar. 

1-2 Glass of Water. 

A Pinch of Carmine. 

Peel the almonds whole, and then rub 
them well with a linen- cloth, to take off 
any dust. Put them into a skillet with a 
pound of the finest white sugar, and a 
dash of Carmine, if you wish to tinge 
them to a beautiful rose. But they are 
very beautiful when a snowy white. 
Place the skillet on the fire, stirring all 
the time until the almonds crackle hard. 
Then take off the fire and worlc until 
the sugar becomes sandy and well- 
detached from the almonds. Then sep- 
arate one part of the sugar, and again 
put the almonds on he fire, stirring them 
lightly with a spoon as they again pick 
up the sugar, paying strict attention to 
the fire, that it be not too quick. WTien 
the almonds have taken up this part of 
the sugar, put in that whicli you have 
reS'erved, and continue to parch until 
they have taken up all the sugar. Then 
take a piece of paper and put it in a 
sieve, and throw the almonds upon it, 
shaking around so as to separate those 
which still cling together. Bach almond 
must be separate and incrusted with 
sugar. 

Peanut Pralines. 

Pistaches Pralinees. 

1 Pound of Peanuts. 

1 Pound of Sugar. 
1-2 Glass of Water. 
A Pinch of Carmine. 

Peanuts, which have been dubbed "Pis- 
taches" by the Creoles, may be made into 
delightful confections by procedure as 
outlined above for "Amandes Pralinees."'

Peanut Praliiie§. 

Praline aux Pistaches. 

1 Pound of Peanuts. 

1 Pound of Brown Sugar. 

4 Tablespc'onfuls of Water. 

1 Tablespoonful of Butter. 

Shell the peanuts and break into bits 
Then set the sug-ar and water to boil, 
and as it begins to simmer add the pea- 
nuts and the butter. Stir constantFy and 
as it bubbles up once take from the fire, 
pour from he spoon on the marble slab 
or a buttered plate, and set away to 
harden. 

Alolasses Candy. 

Oandi Tire a la Melassee. 

Louisiana is rightly the home of Mo- 
lasses Candy, for it was right here, in 
this old city, in the environments of 
which sugar was first raised in the 
United States, and molasses, sweet anl 
health-giving, was first given to the 
world, that Molasses Candy, or "Candi 
Tire," as the Creoles call it, first had 
birth. "Candi Tire" parties, or Molasses 
Candy Pullings, were among the pleasur- 
able incidents of life among the early 
New Orleans belles and beaux. Take 
1 Quart G'f Louisiana Molasses. 

1 Tablespoonful of Butter. 

1 Pound of Granulated Sugar. 

2 Tablespoonfuls of Vinegar. 

1-2 Teaspoonful of Soda. 

The Juice of 1 Lemon. 

Boil the sugar until it becomes quite 
thick when dropped into water. Add the 
molasses and the vinegar and butter. Boil 
tin it hardens when dropped into cold 
water. Then stir in a small half tea- 
spoonful of bicarbonate of soda, and pour 
into buttered tins, and as soon as it be- 
gins to co-ol sufficiently pull till white. 
Moisten the hands while pulling with ice 
water or butter. The sticks may be 
single, twisted, braided or flattened, ac- 
cording to taste. 

La Colle. 

2 Pounds of Bro'wn Sugar. 

Or 1 Pint of Molasses. 
2 Cups of Louisiana Pecans. 

"La Colle" is a delightful kind of mo- 
lasses praline cake that the old negro 
cake and candy vendors make out of 
black molasses and pecans or peanuts. 
These cakes are placed in dainty white 
paper cases and dried, and sold, to the 
delight of the little Creole children, and 
older folks, too, for that matter. They 
are made by taking two pounds of brown 
sugar, and boiling it down to almost one 
pint of syrup. To this dark syrup add 
two cups of pecans, cut or mashed in 
various irregular sizes. Then, when it 
becomes so thoroughly boiled that It 
passes like a thread between the fingers, 
they pour it into small white paper cases 
about four inches long and two inches 
wide, making the cake about a half or 
quarter of an inch in thickness. They set 
these to dry, and always find a ready 
sale for them. The cases are made out 
of white foolscap paper, folded neatJy 
like the light cover of a box. 

Or, take one pint of Molasses and bring 
to a boil. Throw in the peanuts, and 
then fill the little paper cases. Either 
way, "La Colle" is always in demand 
from the faithful old vendors. 

Pop-Corn Candy. 

"Tac-Tac." 
1 Cupful of lYhite Sugar. 



, 1 Tablespoonful of Butter. 

3 Tablespoonfuls of Water. 
, 3 Quarts of Nicely-Popped Corn. 

Put the butter, water and sugar into a 
boiler, and boil till it begins to almost 
run to candy; then throw in the nicely- 
popped corn; stir vigorously over the fire 
until the sugar is evenly distributed over 
the corn ; then take the kettle from the 
fire and stir until It cools a little. In 
this way you will have each grain or 
kernel separate and coated with sugar. 
If you wish, pile it into mounds and roil 
into balls while still hot. enough for the 
grains to adhere. These are put into 
dainty rolls of tissue paper and sold 
along the streets of New Orleans. 

Mais "Tac-Tac." 

1 Pint of Louisiana Molasses. 
3-4 Pound of Indian Corn (Parched). 

Boil one pint of Louisiana molasses, 
and, as it comes to the boiling point, 
throw in about hree-quarters of a pound 
of parched Indian corn, parched to a 
blossom ; stir w^ell, and then pour into 
little paper cases, about five or six inches 
in length, three in width and one and a 
half in depth. Let these cool before 
touching. This is another of the peculiar 
forms of candies sold by the old Creole 
negroes of New Orleans. 

CABAM£LS. 

Caramels. 

1 Pound of Clarified Sugar. 

Sufficient Water to Melt. 

Take one pound of clarified sugar and 
add just sufficient water to melt; boil 
it till it is very brittle and has the 
slightest odor of begrinning to burn: 
then pour it on a buttered slab or plaie 
and, as soon as it is cool enough to re- 
ceive an impression from the finger, cut 
it out with a cc-mmon case knife Into 
small squares of about an inch in size, 
after which glace with another coating 
of sugar. Let them dry and keep them 
tightly closed, as they are easily injured 
and become soft by contact with the at- 
mosphere. 

Chocolate Caramels. 

Caramels au Chocolat. 

1-2 Pound of Chocolate. 2 Cups of -Sugar. 

1-2 Cup of Milk. 

1 Tablespoonful of Butter. 

1 Teaspoonful of Vanilla. 

Set the sugar to boil; scrape the choco- 
late in the milk, and add it to the boil- 
ing sugar, and stir in the butter; then 
boil till it forms a syrup. Take from the 
fire and turn upon a greased slab or 
upon a buttered dish or pan that is quite 
square. When it begins to cool suffi- 
cient to receive an impression from the 
finger, cut into small squares with th*; 
case knife and set in a cool, dry place to 
harden. A good test as to whether the 
mixture is done is to drop a little from 
the end of a spoon into a cup of coid 
water. If it begins to harden instantly, 
it is ready to' take from the stove. 

The Cream Chocolate Caramel is made 
In the same way, only cream is used in- 
stead of milk. Again, the Chocolate Car- 
amel may be made simply by dissolving 
four ounces of chocolate in a little water 
and adding to a syrup made of one pound 
of sugar. 

To any of the above recipes, essence of 
vanilla, orange or lemon may be added, 
in which case you will have Vanilla or 
Orange or Lemon or Cream Caramels. 
In making the Lemon Caramels, however, 
grate the zest of the lemon with a lump 



249 



of sugar, and then add to this the lemon 
juice and water enough to dissc'lve the 
sugar. Stir the whole into the boiled 
Caramel a few minutes before taking 
from the fire Orange and Lime Caramel 
may also be made from the fruits In this 
manner. 

Caramel Orang:e$. 

Oranges au Caramel. 

6 Oranges. 

2 Cups of Sugar. 

1 Tablespoonful of Butter. 

Peel and quarter the oranges in theil 
natural divisions, being careful not to 
break through the pith or allow the Juice 
to escape. Then string them on fine wire, 
or take up on the point of a hatpin and 
dip into the Caramel. When sufficiently 
coated, place them in the stove for a few 
minutes to dry and "Glacee," or Glaze. 
(See recipe under Icings for Cakes, etc.) 

Caramel Chestnuts. 

Marrons au Caramel. 

1 Pound of Chestnuts. 

2 Cups of Sugar. 

1 Tablespoonful of Butter. 

Take fine, large Chestnuts, and trans- 
fix them on a hatpin or on small pointed 
sticks. Dip them in the Caramel, and 
then dry and Glacee them. (See Glacee 
under heading Icings for Cakes, etc.) 

BONBONS. 

Candy Drops, 

Pastilles. 

1 Pound of Sugar. 
Water to Dilute. 
Flavoring Extract to Taste. 

These are favorite candies with the 
Creoles, and very easy to make. They 
may be of any size, a lozenge, a tablet 
or a drop, and they may also be of any 
color. Pound and sift a pound of sugar 
that has been doubly refined, first 
through a coarse and then through a 
fine sieve. Put in an earthen vessel, and 
add the flavoring extract, whether of 
lemon, orange, cinnamon, cloves, rose or 
violet or vanilla or carmine. Dilute the 
sugar with a little water and the liquid. 
It must not be too thin, or it will run. 
nor too thick, or it cannot be poured 
easily, but a nice rather stiff paste. Set 
the saucepan on the fire, being careful 
to select a saucepan that has a spout. 
As soon as the mixture begins to bubble 
up about the sides of the saucepan stir 
it once well and take from the fire, and 
drop it in small lumps through the spout 
of the saucepan upon sheets of tin, and 
let it stand two hours to dry. Then put 
in the stove a few seconds to finish dry- 
ing. As they become hard and brilliant, 
take them out, else they will lose their 
flavor. 

Cream Pastilles. 

Pastilles a la Creme. 

1 Pound of Fine W^hite Confectionery 

S'ugar. 

1 Tablespoonful of Vinegar. 

1 Teaspoonful of Lemon Extract. 

1 Teaspoonful of Cream of Tartar. 

4 Tablespoonfuls of Water. 

Moisten the sugar with the water and 
set to boil. Add vinegar and Cream of 
Tartar. Let it boil till brittle. Then take 
from the fire and add the Lemon Ex- 
tract. Turn quickly on a wet slab or 
buttered plates. When it begins to cool, 
pull till very, very white, and then cut 
into small squares of about a halt inch. 



Orang:e Pastilles. 

Pastilles a I'Orange. 

The Strained Juice of 2 Oranges. 
1-2 Ounce of Orange Sugar. 
3 1-2 Ounces of Coarse Sugar. 

To make the orange sugar, rub the rind 
of the oranges on the sugar and dry. 
Then proceed to add the water and three 
and a quarter ounces of sugar and 
flavoring. As soon as it begins to dis- 
solve in the pan take a small wooden 
spoon and stir it for a few minutes. 
Then remove it from the fire, stirring 
continuously, and drop the pastilles upon 
a sheet of paper, cutting them off in 
drops about the size of a pea with a 
curved piece of wire or a hairpin. When 
they are quite dry turn the paper upside 
down, brush the reverse side with a paste 
brush slightly moistened with water, and 
shake off the pastilles with the point of 
a knife upon a dry sieve. Then move 
the sieve to and fro over a very slow fire, 
so that all the moisture may be removed 
from the drops, and keep them in well- 
bottled jars. 

The above recipe will serve as a guide 
for all Fruit and Liquor or Essence Pas- 
tUles. 

Fruit Pastilles. 
Pastilles de Fruits. 

3 1-2 Ounces of ^ugar. 
1-2 Ounce of Any Fruit Juice. 

All pastilles with fruit juices may be 
made in exactly the same manner as 
Orange Pastilles. Use one-half an ounce 
of juice and three and a half ounces of 
sugar, and add a little more sugar if it 
appears liquid after taking from the fire. 
Ginger Pastilles. 
Pastilles de Gingembre. 

1-2 Ounce of Lemon Juice. 

3 1-2 Ounces of Sugar. 

1 Teaspo'onful of Essence of Jamaica

6 Grains of Ambergris. 
1-2 Dram of Basil Seed. 
1-2 Dram of Orange Peel. 
18 Grains of Mace. 
18 Grains of Nutmeg. 
1-2 Dfam of Storax Calamite. 
Pound the Musk, Storax and Ambergris 
to a sugar, so as to extract all the resin- 
ous properties. Make the whole into a 
paste with a half pound of sugar and just 
enough Gum Tragacanth to give it suffi- 
cient consistency. Mix the paste thor-' 
ouglily and then cut into small tablets 
that will weigh about a dram each. Many 
of the old Creoles take these pastilles 
three or four times a day, as they facili- 
tate digestion and create an excellent ap- 
petite. They are also excellent for per- 
sons suffering from debility. 
Lemon Pastilles. 
Pastilles au Citron. 
1-2 Ounce of Water. 
3 1-2 Ounces of Sugar. 
1-2 Ounce of Lemon Juice.

Proceed in the same manner as for 
Orange Pastilles. 

Pastilles to Believe Tlilrst. 

Pastilles pour la Soif. 

8 Grains of Tartaric Acid. 

1 Pound of Sugar. 

20 Drops of Lemon Essence. 

Sufficient Gum Tragacanth to Make a 

Paste. 

Take eight grains of Tartaric Acid, one 
pound of sugar, twenty drops of i.iemon 
Essence, and make a paste with all, add- 
ing a sufficient quantity of mucilage or 
Gum Tragacanth to make a paste. Cut 
out into tablets and dry in the open air. 
These tablets are excellent In hot sum- 
mer months. 

Bose Pastilles. 

Pasitilles a la Rose. 

1 Ounce of Water. 

3 1-2 Ounces of Sugar. 

4 Drops of Essence of Roses. 

3 Drops of Cochineal. 

Proceed in the same manner as for 
Orange Pastilles. 

Marshmallow Drops. 

Tablets de Guimauve. 

1-2 Pound of White Gum Arabic. 

1 Pint of Water. 

The Whites of 4 Eggs. 

1 Teaspoonful of Extract of Vanilla. 

DissO'lve the Gum Arabic in one pint 
of water and strain, and add one-half 
pound of the finest white sugar, and 
place over the fire, stirring constantly 
all the time until the syrup is dissolved. 
Then gradually add the whites of the 
eggs, beaten to a stiff froth. Stir in the 
mixture until it becomes thin and does 
not adhere to the fingers. Then flavor 
with the Vanilla Extract, and drop in 
tablets of about the size of a 
B-cent piece upon a sheet dusted 
with powdered starch. Make the 

shape of the tablets slightly convex, 
and in two hours remove from the pa- 
pers, dry for a few minutes in the stove 
and put away for use. 

Peppermint Drops. 

Pastilles a la Menthe. 
1 Cupful of Sugar. 
1-2 Teaspoonful of Essence of Pepper- 
mint. 
A Pinch of Cream of Tartar. 
Crush the sugar very fine, and boil for 
five minutes with water just sufficient 
to moisten. Then take from the fire, 
and add the Cream of Tartar, and after 
mixing well add the Essence of Pepper- 
mint. Beat briskly until the mixture be- 
gins to whiten well, and then drop upon 
white paper and dry in the open air. If 
It sugars before all is dropped add a little 
water and boil again for two minutes. 
NOUGAT. 
Nougat. 
10 Ounces of Sifted Sugar. 
1 Pound of Shredded Almonds, Dried. 
A Few Drops of Essence of Vanilla. 
Put the almonds on a baking sheet or 
plate at the entrance cf the oven. Let 
them heat through and through. In the 
meanwhile put the sugar In a pan or 
porcelain-lined saucepan, and set on a 
moderate stove. Keep stirring with a 
wooden spoon until it begins to melt. 
Then quicken the stirring, and as soon 



as the sugar begins to form upon the sur- 
face In small white bubbles, like pearls, 
immediately throw in the almonds. Stir 
all gently until thoroughly mixed, and 
then pour out on a wet marble slab, and 
flatten to one-sixth of an inch in thick- 
ness. As soon as it begins to thicken, 
cut into pieces of about three inches long 
and two wide, or, better still, if you have 
fancy molds, line them thinly with the 
Nougat, having previously slightly but- 
tered them on the inside. Cut the edges 
of the Nougat even and level before it 
becomes cold, for then it is brittle, and 
breaks easily. 

A very charming and elegant Creole 
dessert is to take a dozen or so of the 
Nougats, form into small baskets with an 
ornamental Caramel handle, fill the lit- 
tle basket with whipped cream and one 
or two strawberries on to^. Serve cold. 

Again, the young Creole girls have a 
pretty way at Christmas and New Tears 
of making dainty boxes of Nougat and 
sending them to their friends, lining the 
boxes about the edges with fresh leaves 
and rosebuds or violets, or simply tying 
them in white tissue .paper with pink or 
baby blue ribbon. 

Parisian Nong^ats. 

Nougats a la Parisienne. 

8 Ounces of Scalded or Split Pistachio 

Kernels. 

6 OiTnces of S'ugar. 

1 Teaspoonful of Vanilla. 

A Few Drops of Prepared Cochineal. 

Boil the sugar till brittle, and then adu 
the Pistachio Kernels or Peanuts and the 
Cochineal. Add the flavoring and mix 
gently. Then pour the Nougat out on a 
marble slab, slightly buttered. Flatten 
out the Nougat by means of a hard lemon 
slightly rubbed with butter to prevent 
sticking. Roll to about one-sixth of an 
inch in thickness, and before it cools 
sprinkle all over with small bits of gran- 
ulated sugar, free from dust, and seeded 
raisins or cleaned currants. Press these 
lightly in with the fingers, and then di- 
vide the sheets of Nougat while hot into 
small diamond shapes about two and a 
half inches Ic'ng and one in width. This 
is a very graceful form of dessert, as 
well as an inexpensive and elegant offer- 
ing to friends at the holiday season. 

DBAGEES. 

Almonds enter very largely into the 
composition of Dragees, as also Gum 
Arabic. Dissolve the Gum Arabic in a 
saucepan with enough water to color it, 
and then set the saucepan o^'e^ a mod- 
erate fire. Stir in the mixture of candy 
a drop preparation, whether of Vanilla, 
Peppermint, Lemon, etc., and then mix 
thoroughly till the solution is complete. 
Strain through a sieve, and then, with 
a wire shaped like a hairpin, cut the 
candy preparation into the tiniest pieces 
of various sizes and shapes, and pour on 
a marble slab which has been oiled with 
butter or wet, to cool, and after an hour 
or so set in the oven for a few minutes. 
In case they are not beautifully polished, 
give them another light coating with the 
solution of Gum Arabic. The next dav 
give them a finer polish by putting them 
Into a basin with a little solution of 
sugar and rose water and a little starch, 
allowing one part of starch to six of 
sugar. Swing the basin back and for- 
wara over a very moderate fire, and 
continue until the Dragees are quite dry. 

In making the Dragees use the propor- 
tions given for Pastilles.

Snffar Plums. 

Des Dragees Sucrees. 

2 Pounds of Best Confectionery Sugar. 

Sufficient Water to Dissolve. 

1 Pound of Any Fruit. 

Sugar Plums, or crystallized fruits, are 
among the daintiest preparations of the 
Creole cuisine. They are the real "Bon- 
bons" so highly prized hy the Creole 
girls. 

To crystallize fruits or candies in small 
quantities, take two pounds of the best 
sugar, and add sufficient water to dis- 
solve It or to start it boiling. Let it boll 
to a syrup. Place the fruit to be crys- 
tallized in a pan, and pour over the 
syrup. Turn the fruit lightly by shaking 
the pan till every side is coated, and set 
to cool. When cool, drain off the syrup 
ana set the pans on their sides, so that 
remaining particles may be drained off, 
and every side be coated with the crys- 
tallized mixture. It is always best to 
to pour the syrup over the fruit while 11 
is warm, as it takes a firmer hold and 
makes a brighter crystal, but it will not 
hurt the fruit if the crystal warms them 
enough to make them very soft, as they 
will be all right when the syrup and 
fruits cool. A small batch of crystallized 
fruit may be prepared at noon, and be 
ready for a 6 o'clock dining. 

Fruits and almond paste bonbons 
should always be softened by the hot 
syrup, and it Is always best to prepare 
the fruits two days in advance when they 
will be sufficiently soft for a light crystal 
to form on them. , 

Chocolate and other bonbons may be 
crystallized in the same way. 

Crystallized Oranges. 

Oranges Cristallisees. ^ 

6 Oranges. 
2 Pounds of Sugar. 
Sufficient Water to Dissolve. 
Crystallize oranges in quarters, keep- 
ing the skins from being punctured. 
Cherries, Strawberries and other berries 
are crystallized whole. Peaches and Apri- 
cots in halves, and so on. 

Crystallized Orangre Blossoms. 
Fleurs d'Oranger Cristallisees. 
Pick the petals one by one from the 
flowers, and put them into water. Drain 
this off, and then squeeze the flowers 
with your hands to bruise them, and 
drain on a sieve. Make a fine syrup, 
equal in bulk to the flowers, clarify it 
and add the flowers. Let the syrup boil 
up about seven times. Then remove it 
from the fire and let it stand till the 
sugar forms a coating all around the 
petals. Then drain them, separate them 
on a paper for an hour or so, till perfect- 
ly dry, and then put in boxes lined with 
white paper, and keep in a cool, dry 
place. 

Crystallized Violets. 
Violettes Cristallisees. 
1 Pound of Violet Petals, ITreshly 
Gathered. 
1 Pound of Sugar. 
Proceed in exactly the same manner as 
for Orange Blossoms, only do not squeeze 
the petals in your hands. These are 
among tlie daintiest of confections, and 
■rtrhile they cost very high when pur- 
chased, they may be easily prepared at 
home. 

Crystallized Rose Petals. 

Feuilles de Roses Cristallisees. 

Pound of Rose Petals. 

1 Pound of Sugar. 



Select beautiful red or pink rose petals 
that have been freshly gathered, and pro- 
ceed in exactly the same manner as for 
Crystallized Violets. 

Crystallized Watermelon. 

Melon d'Eau Cristallise. 

Take the bright red heart of the water- 
melon. Cut into dainty and fanciful 
forms, and place in a dish in the sun 
to dry. Make a syrup as directed above 
tor Crystallized Fruits and with the point 
of a long hatpin or hairpin immerse the 
watermelon in it. Hang to dry from 
these points and you will have a beauti- 
ful crystallized fruit, the dainty pink and 
red of the melon showing through the 
transparent crystal icing. This is a beau- 
tiful confection for "red teas," "pink din- 
ners," etc., where red or pink predomi- 
nates in the decorations. 

liiquenr Bonbons. 

Bonbons a la Liqueur. 

1 Pound of Sugar. 

1 Pint of Water. 

Essence or Liquor to Taste. 

Liqueur Bonbons are made of Boiled 
Sugar, flavored with some kind of 
liqueur. They are also flavored with the 
juice of fruits. Boil the sugar. Then ra- 
move the saucepan from the fire, and 
immerse it in a pan containing cold wa- 
ter, so that the sugar may cool quickly. 
Place a lid over the pan, to prevent the 
sugar forming a crust on top by com' 
tact with the air. Then roll the sugar 
into balls or pellets, flatten out and work 
the flavoring, whether of any kind of 
liqueur, fruit or essence, or Essence of 
Coffee, into them. Then set them in a 
box or mold and thinly cover their sur- 
face with a little starch powder to pre- 
vent forming lumps, and dry in a moder- 
ately warm closet for about fifteen hours. 
As you remove the bonbons place them 
on a dry sieve and brush off any remains

for if any powder adheres it spoils the 
beauty of the bonbons.

Cream Peanuts. 
Pistaches a. la Creme. 

1 Pound of Fine White Sugar. 

1 Teacupful of Water. 

1 Tablespoonful of Extract of Vanilla. 

1-2 Pound of Peanuts, STielled. 

Boil the sugar and water till it comes 
to a thread. Flavor highly with extract 
of vanilla. Then take from the fire and 
stir until it is a creamy white. Throw in 
the peanuts. Drop in a little white gran- 
ulated sugar. Then put them on a table 
on a piece of white paper, and shake well 
till each stands apart. Roll again lighi- 
ly in white powdered or granulated 
sugar, and let them dry. 

LOZENGES. 

Des Pastilles. 

1 1-2 Pounds of Finest W^hite Icing Sugar. 
2 Ounces of Any Essence Preferred. 

1 Ounce of Gum Tragacanth. 

2 Ounces of Tepid Water. 

In making lozenges take one ounce 
of Gum Dragon or Gum Tragacanth, and 
soak it in two ounces of tepid water for 
about six hours. Then squeeze and 
wring out through a cloth, and add about 
a pound and a half of fine icing sugar 
and the desired essence and flavor the 
lozenges in the proportion of about two 
ounces of essence to the quantities abova 
given. If peppermint flavor is desired, 
use one teaspoonful. Then work this 
prepared gum on a marble slab, as you 
would knead dough, until It is firm an.l 
white, yet elastic. Gradually work in the 
sugar and add the essence and work till 
smooth and very elastic. Then roll the 
paste out with fine sugar dredged on the 
slab, and cut into 10-cent size pieces, and 
also into diamond shapes. Place them 
in rows upon sugar-powdered baking 
sheets and dry in the oven. They must 
be ivept in a well-stopped jar in a cool 
place. Orange, Clove, Lemon and Cinna- 
mon Pastilles are all made in the same 
way Every mother can thus make the 
candy that her children use, and know 
that there will he no deleterious effects.

one-third of the sugar, and then work in 
gradually the syrup of squills. After 
working well add the rest of the sugar 
and again work. Lastly add the Para- 
goric and the Ipecacuanha. Then pro- 
ceed to finish these old-fashioned loz- 
enges in the manner directed in the gen- 
eral recipe given. 

SufJTar as Employed in Candy Alakinsr. 

Du Sucre. 

As mentioned above, always select the 
best granulated loaf sugar for making 
candies. Beware of glucose. As a gen ■ 
eral rule, loaf sugar will do for all candy 
making without clarification. Brown or 
yellow sugars are used fc-r Caramels, 
dark Pralines and pulled Molasses Candy 
generally. 

Sugar is boiled more or less, accordin;? 
to the kind of candies one wishes to 
make. It is absolutely necessary to ui - 
derstand the proper degree of boiling if 
you wish to be successful in your efforts 
in making fine candies at home. The de- 
grees are, respectively, "The Small 
Thread," "The Large Thread," "Blow, ' 
"Soft Ball," "Hard Ball," "Crack anl 
Caramel.' The following carefully pre- 
.parer recipes will prove invaluable to the 
amateur: 

Sugar Boiling, 

Le Cuisson du Sucre. 

3 Pounds of Sugar. 
1 Pint of Water. 

To every three pounds of sugar allow 
a pint of water. Put to tioil on a brisk 
fire, and skim carefully and wash on the 
sides with a hair brush dipped in water, 
to prevent the sugar from graining. 

Small Thread. 

Le Petit Lisse. 

3 PC'unds of Sugar. 
1 Pint of Water. 

Dip the forefinger into iced water, and 
then into the boiling sugar, and instantly 
again into the iced water, to prevent 
burning the finger. Then pinch between 
the index finger and thumb. If a small 
thread forms, which breaks when the at- 
tempt is made to pull apart through the 
fingers, the proper degree is reached. 

Large Thread. 

Le Grand Lisse. 

3 Pounds of Sugar. 
1 Pint of Water. 

Boil the sugar a little longer, and then 
try as before; if a thread forms that 
can be pulled two inches without break- 
ing, this degree is reached. This is the 
best degree for preserves, etc. 

The Pearl. 

Le Grande et la Petite Perle. 

3 Pounds of Sugar. 
1 Pint of Water. 
Let the sugar boil a little longer. If 
you find that on drawing it out to a 
thread it snaps quickly, and also that 
while boiling the sugar presents the 
form of large pearls or globules on its 
surface, it will then have reached the 
small pearl degree. When the pearls 
become closely connected on the surface 
of the sugar, it will have reached the 
large pearl degree. 



The Blow. 

Le Souffle. 

3 Pounds of Sugar. 
1 Pint of Water. 

Continue boilling, and after a few min- 
utes dip the skimmer in the boiling 
sugar. Strike it on the edge of the 
boiler. Blow through the holes, and you 
will find that if the sugar is of the right 
degree, it will form intc small globules or 
air bubbles on the other side. This is 
the best degre for creams, and also gives 
a rich flavor to Preserves. 

The Feather. 

La Plume. 

3 Pounds of Sugar. 
1 Pint of Water. 

Boil up the sugar a little longer, dip 
the skimmer in it, and on finding that it 
shivers into a thready fringe from the 
edge, it will have reached the degree 
called the "Feather." If large and ele- 
vated, the degree is the "Large Feather" 
or "La Grande Plume." In a few min- 
utes more they become small and flaky, 
and the next degree, the "Small Feather," 
or "La Petite Plume," is reached. 

The Soft Ball. 

Le Petit Boulet. 

3 Pounds of Sugar. 
1 Pint of Water. 

Keep the sugar boiling. Dip the finger 
into iced water and then into the boiling 
sugar and immediately into the water 
again. If the sugar has enough consis- 
tency to form a small ball when rolled 
between the finger and the thumb, the 
degree is reached. 

The Hard BaU. 

Le Grand Boulet. 

3 Pounds of Sugar. 
1 Pint of Water. 

Continue the test, and if a firmer ball 
is formed, this degree is reached. 

The Crack or Snap. 

Le Casse. 

3 Pounds of Sugar. 

1 Pint of Water. 

Continue boiling, and dip the finger 
after a few moments in iced water and 
then in the boiling sugar, and instantly 
in the water again. The proper degree 
is reached when the sugar is placed be- 
tween the fingers, and will not stick, or 
when distended it snaps hard and dry. 
The first degree is called "Little Crack," 
or "Le Petit Cas.'re," and the second is 
called "The Big Crack," or "Le Grand 
Casse." This is a good degree for Fruits 
Glace, etc. 

Caramel. 

Caramel. 

3 Pounds of S'ugar. 
1 Pint of Water. 
Continue boiling till the sugar reaches 
a light brown color. Then take the ves- 
sel off immediately, or it^ill burn. Any 
degree beyond this renders the sugar cal 
cined and barely fit for cooking pur- 
poses. On taking the vessel from the 
fire, insert the bottom in cold water to 
prevent the sugar from burning. 
To Clarify Sugar. 
Du Sucre Clarifie. 
8 Pounds of Sugar. 
1 Pint of Water. 
The White of 1 Egg. 



254 



In clarifying sugar for Candles, take 
the whole white of an egg for brown 
sugar and half the white for refined 
sugar. Beat to a froth in a dish with 
about a cupful of water, adding It by 
degrees. Then put about eight pounds 
of sugar into a kettle, and dilute It with 
the half of the beaten egg. Let it be- 
come very thick. Set it over the fire, 
and let it boil up twice before you skim 
it. Then skim and continue to add the 
egg by degrees, until the scum Is per- 
fectly white. Take the skimmer from 
the sugar, add another cup of cold wa- 
ter, to carry off any remaining scum, 
take it from the fire and strain. The 
sugar is then kept for use. 

COIiOBING FOK CANDIES. 

Candies may be colored beautifully 
with such harmless preparations as 
Cochineal, Carmine (when properly pre- 

gared). Spinach, Indigo, Saffron or Burnt 
ugar. 

Cochineal. 

Cochenille. 

1 Pound of Powdered Cochineal. 

1 Ounce of Burnt Alum. 
2 Ounces of Salts of Tartar. 

2 Ounces of Cream of Tartar. 

12 Ounces of Sugar. 
2 Quarts of Water. 

Cochineal is an extremely harmless col- 
oring matter, which is used extensively 
by the Creoles. It is made from the Cn- 
cus Cacti, an insect indigenous to Mex- 
ico, and which is found on several spe- 
cies of fig trees. The color Is crimson, 
and when diluted in water it has a 
deep reddish-brown color, and makes 
a beautiful coloring for Pralines and 
other preparations which demand it. 
ii is sold by confectioners and 
druggists in preparations for the pur- 
pose of coloring candies, liqueurs and 
bonbons. 

Take one ounce of powdered Cochineal, 
one ounce of salts of tartar, one 
ounce of burnt alum, two ounces of 
Cream of Tartar, twelve ounces of sugar, 
and two quarts of soft water. Boil the 
water in a porcelain-lined vessel, and 
add the other ingredients. Remove from 
the fire, and then strain at once througrh 
a sieve or cloth, and bottle for use. 

Carmine. 

Carmin. 

2 Gallons of "Water. 

3 Drams of Powdered Alum. 

2 Drams of Bismuth. 

2 Drams of Nitro-Muriate of Tin. 

2 Drams of Nitric Acid. 

Carmine is made by pulverizing Cochi- 
neal in a stone mortar and putting it into 
water at nearly a boiling point. One 
ounce of Brazil wood, obtained from the 
druggist, and one ounce of powdered 
Cochineal are put into separate vessels 
with one quart of TVater each. The 
Cochineal is always put in the water in 
a linen bag. 

To make half a pound of the Carmine 
used so extensively In Creole homes, 
simply pound the Cochineal in a mor- 
tar, add two gallons of water, and let 
It boil for an hour and a quarter. Then 
add about three drams of nitro-muriate 
of tin, made by taking two drams of 
nitric acid, two drams of muriatic acid 
and one dram of bismuth, and dissolving 
under p gentle heat. Continue boillnpr 
the Cochineal ten minutes longer, an^l 



strain the mixture through a fine cloth, 
and let it stand for eighteen hours. Pour 
off the water, and add the solution of 
tin, in three pints of water, and let It 
stand for five days longer, changing the 
water every twenty-four hours. When 
free from any taste or smell the Carmine 
uas been sufficiently washed, and h 
ready for use. Put into china saucers 
and dry in the stove. 

It is exceedingly dangerous to pur- 
chase Carmine, and often it is nothing 
more than a red lead mixture, and pois- 
onous. The Creoles always make their 
own preparations of Carmine, 

Green < Spinach). 

Vert (Bpinards). 

1 Pound of Toung Spinach. 
A Few Grains of Powdered Alum. 

Pound one pound of young Spinach 
to a pulp, and then carefully squeeze all 
the juice out of it. Set to boil, and tie 
moment it begins to curdle remove from 
the fire, and strain all the juice from it. 
Then add to the curd the same weight In 
sugar, a few grains of powdered alum, 
and a little alcohol, and bottle for use. 
Keep in a cool place. 

Yellow (Saffron). 

Jaune (Saffran). 

3 Ounces of Saffron. 

1 Ounce of Alum. 

20 Ounces of Sugar. 

1 Pint of Water. 

Take three ounces of Saffron, one 
ounce of powdered alum, twenty ounces 
of sugar, and one pint of wate**, 
and boil all together. Strain and add 
a little alcohol, and bottle for use. 

Orange. 

Orange. 

1 Ounce of Yellow (Saffron). 
1 Ounce of Cochineal. 

This color is obtained by mixing equal 
quantities of yellow and red (0>chineal). 

Blue. 

Bleu. 

1 Pound of Sugar. 

1 Pint of Water. 

1 Ounce of Indigo. 

1 Tablespoonful of Alcohol. 

Take one pound of sugar, one pint of 
water and boil to a syrup. Add ona 
ounce of Indigo, powdered very fine. 
Let all boil. Then add a little alcohol, 
and strain and bottle. 

Burnt Sugar. 

Sucre Brule. 

1 Pound of Granulated Sugar. 
1 Quart of W^ater. 

Take one pound of granulated sugar, 
and set it on the fire, and stir with a 
wooden spoon until thoroughly dissolved 
and burnt black. Add one quart of wa- 
ter, and let it boil until thoroughly dis- 
solved. Reduce to half the quantity and 
strain and bottle for use. To make col- 
ored sugar, add a little coloring and mix 
thoroughly. Then dry in an oven, and 
keep in a jar.

Vanilla Su£:ar. 

Sucre a. la VanlUe. 

2 Pounds of Loaf Sugar. 
3 Vanilla Beans. 

Take three vanilla beans and cut them 
into shreds. Let them dry, and then 
pound them with about two pounds of 
tine loaf sugar. When reduced to a very 
fine powder, sift, put In a jar and cork 
tight. 



Lemon Sugar. 

Sucre au Citron. 

The Zest of 3 Lemons. 
1 Po-und of Loaf Sugar. 

Grate the zest or outer rinds of the 
lemons on pieces of loaf sugar, and then 
set to dry. When dry, pound very fine, 
sift, and put in a jar and cork tight. 
Orange Sugar is prepared in the same 
manner. 



CHAPTER XLVI. 
CANNING OB PICKLING. 



Conservation des Substances 

The best method of pickling, and the 
surest, is to put the substance to ba 
pickled in a glass bottle or a tin can 
that has been hermetically sealed, and 
subject it to a temperature ranging from 
80 to 100 degrees, in a water bath, or 
"bain-marie," always taking the pre- 
vious precaution to eliminate all air 
from the vessel before sealing it. 

The great success of canning and pre- 
serving is to exclude the air and to can 
while hot, filling the vessel to the brim. 
Have your jars in a vessel of hot water 
on the stove. Roll them in the hot wa- 
ter, and then fill immediately to the top 
with the hot boiling fruit or vegetables. 
Have the tops of the jars ready and heat- 
ed, and seal quickly, screwing down 
every few moments a little tighter, as the 
ingredients cool and the glass conse- 
quently contracts. Keep the jars in a 
cool, dark place. 

Attention to a few rules will make it 
possible for each housekeeper, especially 
the Louisiana country housewife, to put 
up all her own goods,- whether of vege- 
tables or fruits or pickles. 

Canned Corn. 

r>u Mais en Conserve. 

8 Quarts of Corn. 

1 Tablespoonful of Lard to Each Quart 

of Corn. 

Boil the com on the cob until no milk 
will exude if the grains are pricked with 
a needle. Then cut the corn off the cou 
and pack into cans or stone jars, putting 
first a layer of salt half an inch deeo 
and then a layer of corn two inches deep, 
and continuing with these alternate lay- 
ers until the jar is nearly filled. The 
top layer must be of salt, and about ao 
Inch thick. Pour over all this melted 
lard in proportion of about a tablespoon- 
ful to a quart at the corn. Set on the 
firei in a bain-marie, and let all the 
bubbles come to the surface. Take off 
stick a silver fork down into the jar, to 
see that all bubbles have ceased to form. 
Seal hermetically, and then set in a bain- 
marie, at a temperature |0f from 80 to 
100 degrees, and let it cool. Keep in a 
cool place, and use as wa-nted. 
Canned Tomatoes. 
Des Tomates en Conserves. 

8 Dozen Tomatoes. 
A Bain-Marie. 

Pour boiling water over the Tomatoes 
to loosen the skins. Then skin the To- 
matoes, and brine to a hard boil for 
twenty minutes. Then drain and can as 
quickly as possible, excluding all air. 
Set in a bain-marie to cool, and keep ii 
a cool, dark place. 

Canned Mnshrooms. 

Des Champignons en Conserve. 



Alimentaires et Vegetales. 

8 Quarts of Mushrooms. 

Cook the mushrooms for three-quarters 
of an hour in salted water, drain lightly 
and can them, excluding all air. Sub- 
mit to the "bain-marie," letting them 
cool gradually. Keep in a cool place. 
Canned Green Peas. 

Des Petits Pols en Conserve. 
1 Dozen Quarts of Green Peas. 

Select the youngest and most tender 
peas, put them in boiling water, and let 
them cook for about thirty minutes. 
Drain lightly, and can Immediately, ex- 
cluding all air. 

Other vegetables may be canned in al- 
most the same identical manner. 
PICKLES. 
Des Cornichons. 

Pickles should not be made in vessels 
of brass, copper or tin, and should al- 
ways be put up in glass bottles or hard 
stone"ware. Only the best vinegar should 
be used. All vinegar should be scalded 
before using with pickles, otherwise it 
will not keep well. This is a fact that 
must be remembered if you wish tor suc- 
cess. 

In sour pickles use only the best cider 
vinegar. Never boil it, but simply bring 
it to the boiling point, before you pour 
it over the pickles. Always add a small 
piece of alum to' Cucumber or Gherkin 
Pickles, if you wish them to be a beauti- 
ful green and crisp. 

Never use any but a wooden spoon in 
putting up pickles, and be careful in the 
use of spices, so that no one flavor will 
predominate, but that all will unite in 
a most agreeable whole. 

Pickles must be kept in a cool, dark 
place, and always well covered with vine- 
gar. 

The jars should be examined at fre- 
quent intervals. If white specks make 
their appearance in the vinegar, draw it 
off, scald and add, if the pickles are 
sweet, two tablespoonfuls of sugar and 
a few cloves. 

Sweet Pickles.

1 Dozen Allspice. 

1 Dozen Blades of Mace. 

3 Dozen Cloves. 

1 Cup of Sugar. 

1 Gallon of Boiling Vinegar. 

Wash the Cucumbers, selectine nice 
small ones, of about a finger in length. 
Cover them with a strong brine, suffi- 
ciently strong to bear an egg. Put a 
cover on the jar. and let them stand for 
about three days. Then take them out 
and throw awav the brine, rejecting all 
the pickles that have become soft undei

pressure. Put into a kettle c-f fresh wa- 
ter, and add a little powdered alum, al- 
lowing about a quarter of a tcaspoonful, 
or a piece about half the size of a bird's 
egg, to one gallon of liquid. Put a close 
lid over all the boiler, and steam, without 
letting them boil, for about four or five 
hours. To one hundred small cucumbers 
or a gallon, allow three dozen black pep- 
pers, one dozen blades of mace, three 
dozen cloves, one dozen allspice, all 
whole, and one cup of sugar. Boil five 
minutes. Place the pickles in clean jars, 
and pour over the boiling vinegar. These 
pickles must then be corked closely. 
Three days after take or draw off th:<j 
vinegar, boil again, and again pour over 
the pickles. Repeat this operation tnree 
times, at about intervals of three or four 
days. Then cover with a stout cloth, 
cork with a wooden or cork stopper, and 
In about two months they will be ready 
for use. Examine from time to time. 

Sour Pickles.

100 Small Cucumbers. 
A Boiling Brine. 
24 Whole Spices. 
1 Ounce of Mustard Seed, 
12 Small Red Peppers. 
6 Blades of Mace. 
8 Cloves. 2 Onions. 
Take about 100 small Cucumbers, and 
place them in a jar. Cover them with 
boiling brine that will be strong enouga 
to bear an egg. Let them stand for sev- 
eral days. Then take them out of the 
brine, wipe them well, and place them in 
clean jars. Add two dozen whole spices, 
one ounce of mustard seed, and six 
blades of mace, eight cloves, two chopped 
onions and the red peppers. Cover them 
with boiling vinegar and cork. In sev- 
eral weeks they will be ready for use. 

If you wish the pickles to be very 
green, put them into cold vinegar, and set 
on the stove, and let them heat slowly 
over a moderate fire till they are green; 
or, after the fourth day in which they 
have stood in the brine, pour this off 
and take a porcelain-lined kettle, and 
line the bottom with fig and grapevine 
leaves, put the cucumbers in, with a 
small piece of alum, cover them closely 
with the vine leaves, and then pour cold 
water sufficient to almost fill the kettle. 
Cover closely with an inverted pan or a 
dish, and let them steam slowly for four 
or five hours, till they are green. "When 
a beautiful green, take out of the kettle, 
drain, season as above, pour over boiling 
vinegar, boil for five minutes, and they 
will be ready to be bottled for future 
use.

the above ingredients. 

Pickled Mansoes. 
Mangos Confits au Vinaigre. 
24 Pepper Mangoes or Toung Melon 
Mangoes or Muskmelons. 
A Piece of Alum the Size of a Pecan. 
1-2 Pound of Ginger. 
1-2 Ounce Bach of Black Pepper, Mace. 
Allspice, Tumeric. 
1-4 Pound of Garlic. 
1-2 Pint of Grated Horseradish. 
1-2 Pint Each of Black and White Mus- 
tard S'eed. 
1-2 Teacupful of the Best Olives. 
1-2 Head of Fine Toung Cabbage. 
4 Green Tomatoes. 
Take two dozen Pepper Mangoes or 
young Muskmelons that are no larger 
than an orange. Let them lie for two 
weeks in a brine strong enough to float 
an egg. Then soak them in pure water 
for two days, changing the water every 
day. Remove the seed by cutting a slic 
down the side of the Mangoes, but do 
not take the meat out. Rinse in cold 
water. Put a layer of green grape leaves 
in a kettle, and lay on this a layer of 
Mangoes, and then a layer of leaves, and 
so continue till all are used up. Let the 
top layer be of grape leaves. Now add 
a piece of alum about the size of a 
pecan, and pour vinegar over the mix ■ 
ture, and let all boil for fifteen or twenty 
minutes. Then take out the leaves, and 
let the Mangoes remain in this vinegar 
for five or six days. Prepare a stuffing 
of half a pound of ginger, which has 
been soaked in brine for two days and 
which you will have cut into small dice; 
one-half an ounce each of black pepper, 
mace, allspice, Tumeric; one-quarter of 
a pound of garlic, which has been soaked 
In brine for twenty-four hours and dried; 
a half pint of grated horseradish, and 
a half pint each of black and white mus- 
tard seed. Bruise all the spices well till 
fine, and mix them with a half teacupful 
of the best olive oil. Take a half head 
of fine solid cabbage, and chop fine; 
add a half pint of finely-chopped onions, 
a few small cucumbers, and a few green 
tomatoes, which have lain in a brine 
overnight. Drain all well arid then se- 



lect any Imperfectly shaped mangoes, or 
any that have become too soft to stuff, 
and chop these fine with the spices; mix 
all this stuffing well together, and stuff 
the mangoes. Tie them with pieces wf 
twine, or sew them up, put in a stone 
Jar, and pour over them the very be»t 
cider vinegar. Set them in a dry place 
and cover well. At the end of a month 
add a pound and a half of brown sugar, 
and bottle for use. This preparation will 
keep for two years. 

Pickled Onions. 

Ognons au Vinaigre. 

100 Small Onion Buttons. 

1 Tablespoonful of Allspice. 

1 Tablespoonful of Black Pepper and 1 

Red Pepper Pod to Each Pint of 

Vinegar. 

1 Dozen White Pepper Corns. 

1 Dozen Cloves. 

4 Blades of Mace. 

Select the smallest white button onions. 
Remove the outer skin, and then remova 
the inner skin with a silver knife. Steel 
will blacken the onions. Pack them in 
well- washed and carefully dried jars. 
Then pour over the onions a strong 
brine, and let them stand for twenty-four 
hours. At the end of this time pour off 
this brine and add another, and let 
them stand twenty-four hours longer. 
On the fourth day make another stronK 
brine, and let it come to a boil, and 
throw in the onions, and let them boil 
just five minutes. Then throw them into 
cold water for several hours. At the end 
of three hours drain off all water and 
pack closely in Jars, allowing one table- 
spoonful of black pepper and a red pep- 
per pod to every pint of vinegar. Whila 
packing the onions, intersperse them witn 
white pepper corns and the spices, with 
an occasional piece of mace or cloves. 
Fill this up with the scalding vinegar, 
and cork or bottle while very hot. 

If you desire the pickles to be slightly 
sweet, allow a tablespoonful of sugar to 
every pint of vinegar. After three weeka 
they will be ready for use, but, like aU 
pickles, will be better if allowed to stand 
a month or two. 

Pickled String Beans. 

Haricots Verts Confits. 

To Every 7 Pounds of Beans Allow 1 

Quart of Best Cider Vinegar. 

1 Teaspoonful of Alum. 

1 Ounce of Cloves. 

6 Red Pepper Pods. 

Take young, tender beans, and cut the 
two extremities lightly, and string care- 
fully. Throw them into fresh water for 
several hours. Wash "well and drain, and 
put them into earthen jars. Pour over 
boiling vinegar, spiced as for Tomato 
Pickle, and allow one-quarter of a tea- 
spoonful of powdered alum to each quart 
of vinegar. Cover and cork well. Three 
days after pour off this vinegar and boil 
again and pour over the pickles, and let 
them stand again for three days. Add a 
few cloves and pieces of red pepper pods, 
and hottle closely. 

Toung cauliflower, radishes, white and 
red; young corn and melons that have 
just begun to form may be pickled ac- 
cording to the above recipe.

Mace, Cinnamon and Allspice, 

Cut the watermelon rind into strips, 
coolt in clear water and drain. To four 
pounds of rind take one pound of brown 
sugar and half a pint of vinegar, and 
make a syrup, to which add the ground

Pickled rruits. 

Fruits Confits au Vinaigre. 

6 Pounds of Fruit. 

3 Pounds of White Sugar. 

1 Pint of Best Cider Vinegar. 

1 Ounce Each of Cloves, Allspice, Mace 

and Cinnamon. 

1 Nutmeg. 

In pickling fruits, whether peache", 
pears, plums, damsons or cherries, allow 
six pounds of fruit, three pounds of 
white sugar and one pint of the best 
vinegar, and spices and mace, cinnamon 
cloves, allspice and nutmeg in propor- 
tion. Put the fruit into a kettle with 
alternate layers of sugar and spices, and 
add the vinegar. Let all boil for about 
five minutes, and then skim out the fruit 
and pack in glass jars as it begins to 
cool. Let the syrup boil till thick, and 
then pour the boiling syrup over. Bottlo 
tight, and examine from time to time. 
If they sho'W signs of fermenting open 
the jars or set thenj uncovered in a ket- 
tle of boiling water, and heat the con- 
tents till they begin to bubble and cork 
again. 

In pickling cherries, always leave the 
stems On the cherries, and to every quart 
allow a pint of vinegar and two large 
teaspoonfuls of sugar, a dozen cloves an-l 
allspice, and five or six blades of mace. 
Let the vinegar and spices boll together 
for about five minutes, and then turn 
Into an earthen jar and let them coo'. 
Then strain and fill the pickle jars with 
the cherries about three-quarters full, 
and pour the cold vinegar over them. 
Bottle tight, and keep in a cool place. 

Sweet Tomato Pickles are put up by 
using the ingredients mentioned above, 
allowing, however, a pint and a half of 
vinegar to the above quantities of sugar 
and fruit. Stew the tomatoes, vinegar 
and spices together for about three-quar- 
ters of an hour, and then bottle f<Tr use. 
Tomato Catsnp. 
Sauce de Tomates. 

4 Pecks of Ripe Tomatoes. 

2 Quarts of Vinegar. 

1-4 Pound of Salt. 
1-2 Pound of Sugar. 
3-4 Ounce of Black Pepper. 
3-4 Ounce of Allspice. 1 Ounce of Mus- 
tard. 1 Ounce of Ginger, Ground. 
1-3 Ounce of Cloves, Ground. 
1-8 Ounce of Garlic, Minced Very Fine, 
A Good Dash of Cayenne. 
1-2 Pint of Alcohol. 

Set the tomatoes to boil in a porcelain- 
lined pot, and, after half an hour, press 
them through a sieve, to remove all the 
seeds and skin. Then return the liquid 
obtained to the pot, and let it reduce to 
three-quarters. Now add the vinegar, an.l 
let all reduce to about one and a quarter 
quarts. Mix thoroughly, and add the 
spices, garlic, ground mustard, pepper, 
etc., and let all come to a boil, stirring 
continually. Then take from the fire, 
and add the alcohol. Bottle while the 
mixture is very hot, and seal well. Thi9 



is an excellent recipe, and the abovo 
sauce is very good, served with cold 
boiled fish, oysters, etc. The Creoles 
often add a half bottle of Port Wine, In- 
stead of the vinegar. 

Chervil Vinegar. 

Vinaigre au Cerfeuil. 

1 Pint of Dried or Fresh Chervil Leaves, 
1 Quart of Best French Vinegar. 
Take a wide-mouthed bottle, and half 
fill it with either fresh or dry Chervil 
leaves. Fill the bottle with the best 
vinegar, and set it in hot water till it 
reaches the boiling point. Then remove 
from the fire. When cool cork, and in 
about two weeks it will be ready for use. 
The Creoles use this vinegar to add a 
flavoring to sauces for salads. 

Pepper Vinegar. 

Vinaigre Pimente. 
1-2 Pint of Small Cherry or Chili Peppers. 
1-2 Pint of Best French Vinegar. 
Every Creole housewife keeps on hand 
a bottle of Pepper Vinegar. It is made 
by filling a pint bottle about half full of 
small Cherry Peppers or Chili Peppers, 
red and green, and then filling up with 
the best French vinegar or cider. Bottle 
well, and in about a week it will be ready 
for use. A peculiarity about this Pepper 
Vinegar is that the bottle may be filled 
again and again as it diminishes, with- 
out adding new peppers. It is very strong 
and hot, and a few drops in one's soup 
or salad will be found quite sufficient. 

Tarragon Vinegar. 
Vinaigre a I'Estragon. 

1-2 Pint of Tarragon Iieaves. 

1 Quart of Best Cider or White Wine. 

The best French Vinegar is made from 
the Tarragon leaves. The French g;aUier 
the leaves and expose them to the heat 
of the sun for several days. Then they 
throw them into the best Cider or White 
Wine and steep for about ti^o weeks. The 
liquor is then carefully strained, a flan- 
nel bag being generally used, and It la 
afterwards bottled, corked and sealed, 
and kept in a cool place for exportation. 

Tarragon Vinegar may also be made 
by purchasing Tarragon leaves from any 
druggist, and allowing a half pint of the 
leaves to a quart bottle fUled with the 
best Cider or WTiite Wine, and follow 
the directions given above. 

Spiced Vinegar.

of^ cider vinegar, and put it into one- 
third of an ounce each of dried mint, 
dried parsley, one grated garlic, two 
small onions, two cloves, one teaspoonful 
of pepper, corns of grated nutmeg, salt 
to taste, and one tablespoonful of sugar 
and good Brandy. Put all Into a Jar. 
and let It stand for three weeks; then 
strain and bottle. 

Tabasco. 

Tabasco a la Creole. 
3 Dozen Large Red Peppers, 



259 



1 Clove of Garlic. 
1-4 Pint of Hot Spiced Vinegar. 

This is one of the most famous of our 
Creole sauces. It is made from cele- 
brated Louisiana Tabasco Peppers, whose 
flavor is unsurpassed. The hot peppers 
are much sought after. The following 
method of preparing this famous Sauco 
a la Creole is the one used in all the 
ancient Creole homes of Louisiana. Take 
three dozen large red Tabasco peppers 
or Chili peppers, and one clove of garlic, 
chopped very fine, and scald them until 
very tender. Then mash the peppers and 
garlic together, and press them through 
a sieve. Take the paste thus formed 
and dilute it with spiced vinegar till it 
reaches the consistency of rich cream. 
Bottle and seal for use. The garlic ma/ 
be omitted.

peppers, two quarts of vinegar, one of 
water, three tablespoonfuls of grated 
horseradish, five onions, sliced, and one 
garlic. Boil all together till the onions 
are very soft. Then mash all together to 
a paste and strain, rubbing through the 
sieve till nothing remains but the seeds 
and skins. When cold, bottle and cork 
tightly for use. 

Maunsell-White. 

This is a famous Creole preparation, 
and it bears the name of the family that 
originated it. In Maunsell-White the in- 
fusion of Cayenne is so hot that only a 
few drops suffice, but the taste Is most 
pungent and stimulative to the palate, 
and is especially agreeable when eating 
oysters with Oyster Bread, or "Hard 
Tack." 

Creole Mustard. 

Moutard Creole. 

1 Pound of Creole Mustard. 

1 Pint of White W^ine. 

1 Teaspoonful of Ground Cloves. 

1 Tablespoonful of Celery Seed. 

1 Tablespoonful of Ground Allspice. 



2 Blades of Ground Mace. 

1 Clove of Garlic. 

1 Teaspoonful of Salt. 

Put a pint of White wine into a clean 
saucepan, add the mixed ground spica, 
crushed clove of garlic, celery seeds ana 
salt. Steep on the rear part of the stove 
for one hour. Mix the mustard, ground 
to a flour, into a smooth paste, with 
equal parts of cider and Tarragon Vine- 
gar. Strain out the spices from the Winn 
and add to the paste while boiling hot. 
Mix thoroughly and bottle for use. 

Salted Almonds. 

Amandes Salees. 

1 Pint of Almonds. 
1 Tablespoonful of Salt. 

Take about a pint of almonds, shell 
them, and then blanch or scald them in 
boiling water till the skin comes off 
easily. Dry well, and place in a flat tin 
dish; add about an ounce of butter, and 
set the plate In a moderate oven until 
the almonds are a golden brown. Then 
take them out of the oven, add a heap- 
ing tablespoonful of salt, stir them round 
and round, or according to the way In 
which the almonds pick up the salt, 
dredging quickly with the salt, and turn 
them into a dish to cool. Pick out the 
almonds, and throw aside the extra salt. 
When cool, place in a box for use, cover- 
ing tightly. The salt may be added when 
the almonds are first put in the oven. 
Be careful to turn frequently while they 
are in the oven, so that they may be 
equally browned on all sides. Almonds 
prepared after this manner are delicious. 

Another way to prepare Salted Al- 
monds is to take the whole blanched al- 
monds and put them on a baking sheet 
and roast m a hot oven to a slight 
brown. Then make a solution of Gum 
Arabic and water and wet the almonds 
with it. Dust over them very finely 
powdered and sifted table salt, and stir 
well but gently till dry. 

Salted Peanuts. ? 

Des Pistaches Salees. 

1 Pint of Whole Peanuts. 
1 Tablespoonful of Salt. 

Take blanched whole peanuts, and pro- 
ceed in exactly the same manner as in 
the last recipe given for Salted Almonds. 



CHAPTER XLVn. 
CBEOiE . BREADS. 



Perhaps no branch of Creole cookery 
so interests visitors to New Orleans as 
our Creole Breads. While in breakfast 
relishes, such as batter cakes, flannel 
cakes, waffles, buckwheat cakes, biscuit, 
etc., we have much in common with other 
sections, there is a distinctiveness about 
our "Brioches," "Babas," "Calas," "Saca- 
mites," "Sweet Potato Bread," French 
Loaves, French Rolls, etc., which are pe- 
culiar to ourselves alone. Our "Baker .? 
Bread," or "Pain de Boulanger," of itself 
stands unique among the breads of thn 
United States, and has been the subject 
of more than one interesting newspaper 
and magazine article. It has this pe- 
culiarity, that one never tires of it, as 
they do of other breads, and the reason 
for this is that it is of exquisite light- 
ness, white and tender, Qf an even porous 
character, with a thin, crisp crust, and. 
best of all, is .lust such a bread as is 
required in our climate. Made into toast.3. 



Des Pains a, la Creole. 

it is the most delightful of all breads, 
no home-made light bread or bakers 
bread in any other part of the United 
States standing comparison with it. 



How to Make and Bake Bread. 

Bread, to be perfect, should be light 
and sweet, with a rich, nutty flavor of 
the wheat- To obtain this result, only 
the best flour and the best dough must 
be used. While the bread is rising the 
temperature of the oven should be at 
about 75 degrees Fahrenheit, and the heat 
of the oven in baking should be about 
360 degrees, or hot enough to raise tho 
Inside of the bread to about 220 degrees. 
This is necessary to cook the starch, 
expand the carbonic gas, steam and air, 
and also to drive off the alcohol whicS 
is used In the yeast. The bakers In New 
Orleans have a way of testing the tem- 
perature of the oven by putting a piece of 
white paper in it. If it turns dark in 



260 



five minutes the oven is of tlie rigrht 
temperature. If it bums, tlie oven is 
too hot, and must be cooled before put- 
ting the bread in, and if the paper ia 
only a light brown at the end of five 
minutes, the C'Ven must be made hotter. 
Again, they sprinkle flour, and If it 
browns or smokes before you can count 
ten, the oven is too hot; if it browns at 
ten, the oven is of the right temperature. 

Brick ovens are used, and the loaves 
of bread are shoved into the oven gen- 
erally on baking boards. 

Rolls are always baked first; then the 
bread, and afterwards the pies and cakes. 
It is best to have the oven heated in time 
and closed for one hour at least before 
beginning to bake. 

Bread should be in the oven about ten 
minutes before it begins to brown. When 
done, remove carefully from the pan, and 
tip it against a bread board, just as they 
do in New Orleans bakeries. This allc^vs 
the air to circulate freely around it. 
Never cover bread that has been freshly 
baked, if you wish it to be fresh and 
sweet and crisp. When cool, place in a 
clean bread box, without using a "bread 
bag," as is so common among many fam- 
ilies. This bag absorbs the moisture from 
the bread, and causes it to sour quickly. 

The New Orleans bakers always use 
Compressed Teast for leavening bread, as 
it does not necessitate making a ferment 
or setting sponge before mixing the 
dough. 

Bakers' Bread. 
Pain de Boulanger. 

1 Ounce of Compressed Teast. 

1 1-2 Ounces of Salt. 

2 Quarts of Water. 

Flour Sufficient to Make a Smooth 

Dough. 

Allow one ounce of Compressed Yeast 
to one quart of lukewarm water, and mix 
well in a wooden bread trough. Then 
add flour enough to make a nice smooth 
dough of medium degree, not too stiff, 
nor yet too soft. Work it well, and then 
let it stand for about five hours In a 
warm place, so as to rise well. When It 
drops, or begins to fall (you can tell this 
by watching the sides of the dough), add 
the same amount of water that was used 
in making the dough, putting two tea- 
spoonfuls of salt into the water before 
adding it. Work this well, and then 
throw down on the table, cut and mold 
the dough into loaves of whatever len^ta 
is desired, and take a smooth stick and 
press lightly down across the loaf about 
two inches from the edge. The bakers 
put the loaves into the oven without set- 
ting in a pan. Watch carefully, and see 
that the oven Is of the temperature men- 
tioned above. 

The above quantity will make about 
five loaves. 

French Bread. 

Pain Francais. 

1 Ounce of Yeast. 

1 1-2 Ounces of Salt. 

2 Quarts of Water. 

1 1-2 Ounces of Sugar. 

Flour Sufficient to Make a Smooth 

Dough. 

Dissolve the yeast, salt and sugar into 
the water and mix in flour sufficient to 
make a nice smooth dough of medlmo 
degree, not too stiff, nor yet too soft. 
Work until it no longer adheres to the 
hand or bowl, and then cover with a 
cloth and set to rise until It has doubled 
its size. This will be in about four or 
five hours. When It begins to sink, work 



it well again and set to rise anew. When 
well risen divide the dough into equal 
pieces, and mold into round ball shapes, 
or into long loaves of about two inches 
in thickness. Lay the loaves on a board 
previously sprinkled with flour and at 
sufficient distance apart not to touch one 
another, and set to rise again. Let them 
rise to nearly double the previous size. 
Have the oven heated, transfer the loaves 
into it, wash over with eggs mixed with 
water, make diagonal cuts half way 
across on each loaf, half way through, 
and close the oven. WTien baked 
brush off the flour, wipe the tops with 
a damp cloth and the bread is ready to 
serve. 

Fan Bread. 

Pain de Plaque. 

1 Ounce of Compressed Teast. 

1-4 Pound of Lard. 

2 Quarts of Water. 

1 1-2 Ounces of Salt. 

Flour Sufficient to Make a Smooth 

Dough. 

1 1-2 Ounces of Su^ar, if Desired. 

This is a nice, large-loafed bread, with 
a dainty crust, that is somewhat glu- 
tinous, and, as the name indicates, is 
baked in a pan by our bakers. It Is re- 
markable for the daintiness of grain of 
the bread after baking. Make the same 
dough as for Bakers' Bread, only work 
the loaves twice over; then put them in 
the oven and dredge lightly with flour. 
As they begin to rise make a light paste 
of flour and water or egg and water and 
spread very lightly over them. This la 
brushed lightly with lard, to keep from 
getting too crusty. Bake in a rather 
hotter oven than the other bread. 

French LoaTes. 

Des Petits Pains Francais. 

1 Ounce of Compressed Yeast. 

2 Quarts of Water. 

1 1-2 Ounces of Salt. 

Flour Sufficient to Make a S"mooth 

Dough. 

These are the dainty little loaves so 
generally used in our New Orleans res- 
taurants and hotels. Make the dough 
as in Bakers' Bread, and after it has 
risen and begins to drop, scale the 
dough off, and cut and mold them into 
little loaves of about the length of a 
nian's hand. Mold them round and set 
them to rise again. When they are very 
light, which will be in a few minute.^, 
take them up and work them well sep- 
arately, and then mold them again an.! 
gently press in the center with a smooth 
stick. Lay them in a box with a stiff 
cloth over them, and let them lie for a 
few minutes. Take off the cloth and set 
them in the oven to brown nicely. Sot 
to cool as above indicated. 

Twist Loaves. 

Pain Tresse. 

1 Ounce of Compressed Yeast. 

2 Quarts of Water. 

1 1-2 Ounces of Salt. 

Flour Sufficient to Make a Smooth 

Dough. 

Make t^ie identical dough as in "Bak- 
ers' Bread." After the first rising and 
throwing in of water and working tlio 
bread cut the dough, and divide each 
portion Into three pieces of dough. Dust 
this dough well with parched flour and 
roll the pieces into lengths of about two 
feet, or a foot *nfl a half, and plait 
them. Then lay them In a long box or on 
a board, and cover with a stiff cloth, as 



26X 



in French Loaves, and let them lie till 
they begin to rise. Place in the oven 
and bake to a nice brown. 

Bye Bread. 

Pain de Seigle. 

1 Ounce of Compressed Teast. 

2 Quarts of Water. 

1 1-2 Ounces of Salt. 

Rye and Flour Sufficient to Make a 

Smooth Dough. 

A Few Kummel Seed. 

Make the dough a little stiffer than 
for White Bread, allowing one-half of 
wheat flour and one-half rye. Allow the 
same amount of yeast, and add a few 
Kummel seeds and a little more salt than 
tor White Bread. Set to rise. After ons.- 
rising work again as in Bakers' Bread, 
divide it into loaves, and set it to rise 
again. When about twice its original 
size bake in a moderate oven. 

Home-Made Creole Light Bread. 

Pain de Menage a la Creole. 

2 Quarts of Flour. 

1-2 Cake of Compressed Teast. 

1 1-2 Pints of Milk or Water. 

Teaspoonful of Salt. 

1 Tablespoonful fi-f Lard. 

Sift the flour. Then put into a wooden 
bread trough or a pan, and make a hole 
in the center of the flour. Add warm 
water or milk sufficient to make a nic*?, 
smooth, rather stiff batter. Mix the veast 
with a little tepid water till well dis- 
solved, and add. Then set to rise over 
night in a warm place. In the mornin>| 
take up and again make a hole in the 
center of the dough, and add half a ta- 
blespoonful of melted lard or butter, oiie 
and one-half teaspoonfuls of salt, and 
one and one-halt pints of warm milk or 
water. Then add the flour and kneal 
well about ten times. When it forms a 
smooth dougli form into a cake, and set 
to rise again. When risen to about twice 
its size take up and knead again about 
five times, that is, work one piece of 
dough over the other about five times, 
and set to rise again. Always, when set- 
ting to rise, sprinkle the bottom of the 
pan with a little flour. After an hour 
take up the bread and knead for about 
ten minutes, till you .have a nice dough, 
that can be worked without sprinkling 
the biscuit board with flour. Then form 
the dough into two loaves. Place -them 
side by side in the baking pan, and bake 
in a moderate oven for about three- 
quarters of an hour. Serve hot or cold. 

Milk Bread. 

Pain au Lait. 

2 Quarts of Flour. 

1-2 Teacupful of Teast or 1-2 Cake of 

Compressed Teast. 

1 Pint of Flresh Milk. 

1 Teaspoonful of Salt. 

2 Ounces of Butter. 

Scald the milk, and then turn it into 
the bread trough or pan. Add imme- 
diately the butter and the salt. When it 
becomes tepid add the yeast and about 
three-quarters of a pint or half a pint 
of flour, using always good judgment in 
addinsr sufficient, more or less, to make 
a thick batter. Then beat thoroughly 
'■■'1 qir bubbles accumulate all over the 
surface of the batter. Then cover and 
set in a warm place over night. Very 
earlv in the morning work in the rest 
of the ilour, and take it out of the paTi 
and put on a board and knead quickly 
and lightly until the dough Is perfectly 



smooth and does not cling to the hands 
or the board. Then put it back in the 
trough or pan and cover with a cloth, 
and set to rise again in a warm place. 
\Vhen it has increased to twice its bulk 
turn again upon the board, and then dl- 
viu^ the dough into two parts. Mold 
these lightly and gently into small loaves, 
and stand away to rise for about half an 
hour. Then set in the oven, which should 
be moderately quick, and bake for three- 
quarters of an hour. 

The famous Vienna Bread, now so 
much sought after, is nothing else than 
this ancient Milk Bread, or Creole "Pain 
au Lait," that has been used for genera- 
tions in Creole homes. 

Buttermilk Bread. 

Pain au Babeurre. 

1 Quart of Flour. 
1 Pint of Buttermilk.

warm water. Then add the flour and set 
to rise. When well risen knead lightly, 
place in a baking pan, let it rise again 
for half an hour, and bake in a moderate 
oven. This makes an excellent, nutri- 
tious and very white bread, and is much 
used by the Creoles in making French 
Toasts. 

Buttermilk Rolls are made by simply 
pinching off the above dough into pieces 
abO'ut the size of a walnut or egg, 
shaping into little balls, and proceeding 
as above.

and the rice, which you will have pressed 
through a sieve. Mix all thoroughly, and 
beat till very light. Then grease the 
bottom of a shallow pan and turn the 
mixture in and bake half an hour in a. 
hot oven. Serve hot, buttering the slices 
freely. This is a delicious breakfast 
bread, and, as in any of the above re- 
cipes, cold rice left over may be utilized 
in its making.

mashed. Put the milk, or water, and the 
yeast and salt into a bowl or pan; add 
the butter, which must be melted. Beat 
thoroughly, and set over night in a warm 
place. In the morning add the potatoes, 
mashed and pressed through a sieve, and 



262 



gradually add the flour, which must be 
sifted three times. Beat to a light sponge; 
then cover, and set to rise in a warm 
place till it doubles its size. Then turn

water. Then add flour sufficient to make 
a nice dough of medium firmness. Add 
the lard, and work the dough until 
smooth. Then form into a round mass 
and set to rise.- When the dough has 
doubled its size work anew and mol^ 
into small round balls and set into 
greased baking pans at a little distance 
apart from one another. Set to rise 
again, and when they have doubled their 
size bake in a brisk oven.

add the butter, sugar and salt. Then 
add the well-beaten eggs. Stir in about 
one and a half pc-unds of flour, more or 
less, to make a stiff batter, and beat 
till air bubbles accumulate all over i.he 
surface. Then cover with a close cloth 
and set to rise over night in a warm 
place. Then take up the dough and 
knead lightly with the remaining flour to 
make a nice, soft dough, and shape with 
your hands into nice, small rolls or balls. 
Set them together in the baking pan, 
which you will have lightly sprinkled 
with flour. Then set to rise for an hour 
longer. S'et in the oven, and bake about 
a half hour. These rolls are delicious 
for breakfast, or for luncheon or supper. 
They may be set to rise in the early 
morning, and served hot at luncheon.

dissolved in a little warm water, to one- 
half of the milk. Add one-half of the 
flour, and make a thin batter, stirring 
very smooth. Set it to rise in a warn 
place, and at the end of three hours make 
it into a dough with the remainder of the 
milk and flour, and knead well till the 
dough no longer adheres to the board or 
to your hands. Then shape it with your 
hands into small balls, set to rise for 
a half hour longer, or an hour, and bake 
In a moderate oven for a half hour. 



BUSKS. 

Echaudes Sees.

minutes. If sweet rusks are not desired, 
omit the sugar. 

TOAST. 

Pain Roti. 

6 Slices of Bread. 

Butter to Taste. 

Slice the bread, neither too thick nor 
too thin. Cut off the rough edges of 
the crust. Hold on a fork before burn- 
ing coals till nicely toasted on one side. 
Then turn on the other, and proceed as 
before. If dry toast is desired, the bread 
is not uuttered. If buttered toast, butter 
nicely, set in the oven a second and send 
to the table hot. 

Some cooks toast bread by simply set- 
ting the slices in the oven and letting 
them brown on either side. But there is 
no comparison in lightness to the toast 
prepared in the above old-fashioned way. 
Cream or Milk Toast. 
Rotis a la Creme ou au Lait. 

6 Slices of Bread. 

1 Pint of Hot Cream or Milk. 

1 Tablespoonful of Butter. 

Toast the bread nicely, and butter well 
on both sides. Lay in a dish, and pour 
over hot milk. Serve hot. 

Or, heat one pint of Cream, add one 
large tablespoonful of butter, and poor 
over the hot toast. Slightly stale bread 
may be utilized in this way. 

Soda crackers may be toasted and 
served in the same way. This Is a great 
suppel* dish among the Creole plantation 
homes of Louisiana.

The Creoles utilize left-over stale bread 
in that delightful breakfast relish known 
as "Pain Perdu." Break the eggs Into a 
bowl, beat them till very light, add the 
Orange Flower Water and the Brandy, If 
desired, and then add the sugar, and 
beat thoroughly. Add the grated zest of 
a len\on, mix well, and then cut the bread 
into slices or round pieces, taking off the 
crust, or still again into diamond shapes, 
and soak them well for a half hour in 
the mixture. Have ready a frying pan 
of boiling lard (see General Directions 
for Frying), lay in the bread, and fry tP 
a golden brown. Lift the slices out with 
a skimmer, and drain on brown paper In 



263 



the mouth of the oven. Then place on a 
hot dish, sprinkle with powdered sugrar, 
as you would fritters, add a little grated 
nutmeg, if desired, and serve hot.

the milk and the Rum or Brandy, if 
desired. Have ready the slices of stale 
bread, cut in diamond shapes or square, 
and let them soak for about a half hour 
in the mixture. Then lay into a pan of 
boiling lard, and fry to a golden brown. 
Skim out and drain on brown paper in 
the mouth of the oven, and place on a 
hot dish. Sprinkle with powdered sugar 
and grated cinnamon and nutmeg, and 
serve with milk or cream. 

BRIOCHES. 

2 Pounds of the Best Flour. 

1-2 Ounce of Yeast. 

1 Cup of Sugar. 

1-2 Ounce of Salt. 

1 Pound of the Best Butter. 

12 or 8 Eggs. 

To make "Brioches," take a pound and 
a half of the best quality of flour, and 
put it in a wooden bread trough. Make 
a hole in the center of ihe flour, and 
put in a half ounce of yeast, dissolved 
in a little warm water. Take milk or 
tepid water to make the dough, using 
milk if you want it to be very rich and 
delicate, and water if you have not the 
milk. Knead and mix the flour with one 
hand, while adding the milk or water 
with the other. Make a dough that is 
neither too stiff nor too soft, and when 
perfectly smooth set the dough to risa 
in a moderately warm place, covering 
with a cloth. Remember that if you use 
milk to make the dough, the milk must 
be scalded, that Is, it must be heated to 
the boiling point and then allowed to 
grow tepid. Let the dough rise for five 
or six hours, and when increased to twice 
Its bulk take it and add the reserved 
half pound of flour, into which you will 
have sifted the salt. Add six eggs, beat- 
en very light, with the sugar and butter, 
and mix all well together, kneading 
lightly with your hands, and adding more 
eggs if the dough is a little stiff. Then 
knead the dough by turning it over on 
itself three times, and set to rise again 
for an hour or three-quarters of an hour. 
Cover with a cloth. At the end of this 
time take it up and work again lightly 
and then form into "Brioches," that i?, 
work the dough gently with your hands, 
and then break it into pieces about the 
size of an egg. Pat these gently, forming 
them into neat rolls, a little flattened, 
and then make one roll about twice the 
size of the others. This roll will form the 
head of the Brioche. Have ready a bak- 
i«t& nan with a buttered sheet of paper In 
ij and set^Jje central roll in the middle. 
«tange~a?<ja%d the other rolls, having 
at least six, or eight, to form a perfect- 
looking cake. Cover the pan with a 
clean, stiff cloth, and set the cake to rise 
for an hour longer. When well risen, set 
In an oven a few degrees cooler than that 
used for baking Bread. If the rolls arc 
large, let them bake an hour and a hair; 
if medium, one Tiour, and if very small, 
a half hour. Some bakers and cooks 



glace the Brioche lightly with a beaten 
egg, which is spread lightly over the top, 
before placing in the oven. This gives 
the rich, glossy surface so often seen on 
the Brioche. Again, if you cannot afford 
butter, use lard, or half butter and lard, 
but the Brioche made with butter and 
milk is the most delicate and refined, 
and the true Creole Brioche, peculiar to 
New Orleans. After the Brioches are 
baked, set them to cool, if you do not 
wish to eat them hot. When serving, 
whether hot or cold, sprinkle lightly with 
powdered white sugar. 
BABA. 

2 Pounds of the Best Flour. 
1-2 Ounce of Yeast. 

1 Cup of Sugar. 

1-2 Ounce of Salt. 

1 Pound of the Best Butter. 

12 or 14 Eggs. 
1-2 Pound of Seeded Raisins. 
1-2 Pound of Currants. 
1-2 Glass of Sweetened Water. 
A Tinge of Saffron. 
The Sough for the "Baba" is exactly 
the same as that for the Brioche. Pro- 
ceed in exactly the same manner, only 
at the moment of adding the reserved 
flour to the leavened add a half pound of 
raisins seeded, and a half pound of cur- 
rants, washed, picked and dried. Adii 
also a half glass of sweetened, tepid wa.- 
ter, in which you will have put a little 
saffron. Be careful to keep this dough 
much softer than that for the Brioche, 
adding more eggs, if necessary, to insure 
the proper degree of consistency. Th3 
dough must rise at least six or seven 
hours. When it has increased to twice 
its volume, after the third rising, cook 
as you would the Brioche, in an oven a 
few degrees cooler tlian that used in bak- 
ing Bread. The "Baba" is made into a 
round cake. Just like a Pound Cake or 
Sponge Cake, and is formed Into this 
round shape with the hands. After bak- 
ing let cool and sprinkle with powdered 
white sugar. This is the cake that tha 
Creole bakers of New Orleans send as a 
"Christmas" or "New Year's Offering" 
to their customers. 

The German bakers of New Orleans 
took up the cuslom, and make the 
"Baba" by adding to the raisins and 
currants a little Aniseed, Instead of the 
Saffron. 

BTJIiliFBOGS. 
Grenouilles. 

1-2 Pound of the Best Flour. 

1-2 Ounce of Yeast.

delicious small rolls, so dainty and fine, 
and which are served in all our Creole 
homes and restaurants. The rolls are 
joined together lightly in long rows of 
about eight inches in length and three in 
width. They are brought to the doors 
bv the bakers every morning in this old 
ITrench city. The dough for "Bullfrogs 
Is lust the same as that for the Brioche, 
only a half pound of flour is used, in- 
stead of a pound, and a cup of butter. 
Bake in the same manner. They t.re de- 
lightful accompaniments to the most re- 
cherche breakfast.

Then take small molds or tins and line 
wita the Plain Paste, or Brioche Paste, 
rolled very thin. Place within the prep- 
aration of cream cheese in quantity equal 
to an egg in size. Then cover the cakes 
with a piece of rolled dough, and bake 
in a slow oven. These are , delicious 
breakfast cakes, and much in vogue in 
ancient Creole homes. 

FELLIiASO. 

2 Pounds of Flour. 

1 Pound of Butter, or Half Butter and

Dough. 

1 Pound of Figs or Stoned Cherries. 

Make the same dough as for the 
Broiche. At the moment of adding the 
leavened flour and the reserved flour, 
add the stoned cherries or peeled figs, 
the latter cut in halves. Then proceed as 
for "Brioches," and at the last knead- 
ing add the orange flower water and 
the Brandy. Bake as you would th» 
"Brioche." 

WINE OAKK. 

Savarin. 

2 Pounds of the Best Flour. 

1-2 Ounce of Teast. 

1 Cup of Sugar. 

1-2 Ounce of Salt. 

1 Pound of the Best Butter. 

12 or 8 Eggs. 

Miake the same dough as for the 
"Brioche," and at the last kneading place 
It in a cake pan lined with a buttered 
paper. Set it to rise for an hour longer. 
Then place it in the oven, and brush over 
lightly with a beaten egg. Let it bake 
for about an hour and a half, according 
to the size, and then take from the ovr 
and soak in a syrup made of one pound 
of sugar and a pint of water, and boiled 
to a syrup, and into which you will add 
ft wineglass of Brandy or Jamaica Rum. 

These delicious cakes may be formed 

Into small cakes, like the "Brioche," only 

they must not be joined together around 

a central cake. But the "Savarin" is 

nearly always baked in small cake tins. 

BISCUIT. 

Des Biscuits. 

1 Quart of Flour. 

1 Heaping Teaspoonful of Lard. 

1 Teaspoonful of Salt.

Sift the flour well, and add the salt 
and yeast powder, rubbing in thoroughly 
with your hands. Then rub in the lard 
rubbing the flour between your hands tilt 
every portion is permeated by the lard, 
and there are no lumps. Gradually add 
water or milk, using about a pint, more 
or less, mixing In with your hands. Then 
knead the dough until smooth and elas- 
tic. Form into molds, and lay on the bis- 
cuit board, and roll out till about a quar- 
ter of an inch in thickness. Cut into 



rooind cakes with the biscuit cutter. StlcK 
lightly with a fork here and there over 
the surface, and bake in a quick oven 
for about five or six minutes. By adding 
four or five eggs, and, instead of the 
lard, one tablespoonful of butter, to the 
above, you will have egg biscuit. 

Beaten Biscuit. 

Biscuit Battu. 

1 Quart of Flour. 

1 Teaspoonful ol Salt. 

1 Heaping Teaspoonful of Lard. 

1 Pint of Milk or Water, or Half and 

Half. 

Sift the flour and add the salt, mixing

blend by rubbing through the hands till 
not a lump remains in the flour. Now 
add gradually the water or milk, or the 
milk and water combined, using half 
and half of each, and knead all the whole 
till the dough, which must not be too 
sort, but rather stiff, is formed. Then 
lay the dough on a biscuit board on a 
block, and beat for a half hour with a 
rolling pin. Knead lightly, and belt 
again for a full ten minutes, till from 
every portion of the surface and sides 
the air bubbles or "blisters" form. Then 
roll out and cut into round biscuits with 
the cutter, or square ones with a kniTe, 
and stick here and there with a fork. 
Bake in a moderate oven for al30Ut ten or 
tuteen minutes, till a delicate brown 
d.bove and below. 

Stewed Biscuits.

solve the soda in a little warm -water and 
add to the milk, and work rapidly and 
lightly. Then l^y on a biscuit board or a 
block of wood, and beat till the surface 
of the dough is full of air bubbles, or 
"blisters," as the old Creole cooks call 
them. Roll the dough out to about a 
quarter of an inch in thickness, cut into 
round biscuits with a biscuit cutter, or 
square ones with a knife. Stick here and 
there over the surface with a fork, and 
bake for about six minutes in a quiCK 
oven. If too much is used. It not only 
imparts a bitter taste, but gives the flour 
an ugly yellowish green color, that is 
neither tempting nor inviting. 

The Graham Biscuit is made by usin? 
three cups of Graham flour, one cup of 
white flour, one teaspoonful of Baking 
Powder, one heaping tablespoonful of 
sugar or molasses, and two cups of luke- 
warm water, mixing the batter until It

eral times, so that it will be very light. 
"When the mixture grows tepid, add the 
yeast, which you will have dissolved in 
warm water, and beat well till you have 
a good batter. Then cover the mixture 
with a thick cloth, and put to rise in a 
warm place. After three or four hours, 
when it is well risen, add flour sufficient 
to make a nice, soft dough. Knead very 
lightly and quickly for about ten or fif 
teen minutes. At the end of this time 
take up and knead lightly several times, 
and roll the dough out. Cut into little 
biscuits, place them in a slightly-buttered

for about five or ten minutes. Cover up 
the pan with a cloth, and set in a warm 
place for about two hours. Then take 
up, add the well-beaten eggs and the re- 
mainder of the flour. Make a soft dough, 
and knead lightly but constantly for 
about twenty minutes. If the dough l9 
then elastic, form into loaves and set to 
rise in a warm place. When it has in- 
creased to twice Its bulk, which will be 
In about two hours^ pinch off into small 
pieces about half the size of a hen's egg, 
and mold into a small ball. Place all in 
a pan about two inches apart, and cover 
again for half an hour. Then bake in a 
moderate oven for about a quarter of an 
hour. They must be baked to a nice 
brown. 

Soda Orackers. 

Biscuits de Soda. 

1 Quart of Flour. 

3 Tablespoonfuls of Butter. 

2 Cups of Sweet Milk or Water. 

1-2 Teaspoonful of Soda, 
1 Teaspoonful of Salt.

will have dissolved in a little boiling wa- 
ter, and the milk, and mix all well to- 
gether. Then knead well and put upon 
the biscuit board and beat with a rolling 
pin for upwards of half an hour, fre- 
quently rolling the dough over, and 
beating hard until the air bubbles cover 
every part, above and below. Then roll 



out into a nice square even sheet of 
dough, about one-eighth of an inch in 
thickness, and cut into nice square cakes. 
Stick through and through with a fork 
here and there over the surface in even 
rows, and bake them in a moderate oven 
till they are hard and crisp, uut not

Sift the flour very, very fine, and 
then add the salt, and mix well. Add tho 
milk and make into a nice, rather stiff 
dough. Place on a biscuit board and 
beat for fully a half hour, and then turn 
the dough over and beat for fifteen min- 
utes more, the lightness depending upon 
the beating. Roll them out into cakes 
that are almost transparent in thinness, 
but which can also be handled without 
losing their shape. Lay them gently in 
the pan, or better still, roll them out on 
a baking sheet which has been sprinkled 
with flour; then they will not require 
handling. Bake quickly in a hot oven. 
SHOBT CAKE. 
Gateau de Pate au Beurre.

tepid water to make a nice, rather stiff 
dough. Roll out into a thin sheet, about 
half an inch thick, and criss-cross with 
a knife lightly in diamond shapes. Set 
in the oven and bake for about fifteen 
minutes to a light brown. This is brought 
to the table split open and buttered, and 
eaten while hot. 

The short cake for fruits is made in 
exactly the same manner, only a quar- 
ter of a pound of butter is used, and two 
eggs, well beaten, and instead of water 
sour milk or buttermilk is used to mix. 
if you use soda, and sweet milk If you 
use yeast powder. This dough is divided 
In two, one for the upper, and the other 
for the lower crust, and is sprinkle^l 
thickly between with such fruits as 
strawberries, raspberries, etc. The dougn 
should be soft and crisp. 

OOBN BREAD. 

Pain de Mais. 
It has been said, and justly, that th<» 
only people who know how to make corn 
bread are the Southern people, and that 
the further you go south of Mason and 
Dixon's line the better the corn bread, 
corn cakes, corn muffins, that will be 
offered you. Throughout Louisiana tie 
dainty "Egg Breads," Corn Cakes, Muf- 
fins, "Crackling Bread," etc., are tho 
gracious offerings that typical Creole 
planters place before the guests who 
have been invited to partake of morn- 
ing hospitality. As In these ancient 
Southern manors, so also is the olden 
Creole homes of New Orleans. The Cre- 
ole planters of the ancient regime had 
their plantation and city homes, and life 



266 



gravitated between tlie one and the other 
with pleasing and infinite variety. And 
so the cookery of the Creole New Orleans 
is the cookery of Creole Louisiana, and 
in mis cookery Corn Bread occupies, 
with "Potato," "Hominy," "Rice" and 
"Wheat Breaas," its unique and inter- 
esting place. 

It may be added here that the Creoles 
like all true Southerners, never use the 
yellow corn meal for making bread, but 
always the whitest and best meal. In the 
South the yellow meal is only used to 
teed cliickens and cattle. 

Plain Corn Bread. 
Pain de Mais. 

1 Quart of the Finest Indian Meal. 

1 Teaspoonful of Salt. 

A Heaping Tablespoonful of Lard or 

Butter. 

1 Pint of Water. 

Pour just enough boiling water over 
the meal to scald it through and through, 
without making a dough or batter. Stir 
it well, and let it grow tepid. It will then 
be quite dry. Add a melted teaspoonful 
ot lard or butter. Mix this well, and add 
water, and beat till the batter is very 
smooth. Dissolve one teaspoonful of soda 
in a little boiling water, and add to the 
mixture, and grease a baking pan. Turn 
the mixture in and bake in a quick ovea 
for about thirty-five minutes, till a 
goiden brown. Take the bread from the 
pan whole, and place on a hot platter, 
and serve, cutting it at the table into 
slices about two inches long and three 
wide, and serving with butter. 
Egg Corn Bread. 
Pain de Mais aux Oeufs. 

1 Quart of Cornmeal. 4 Eggs. 
1 Tablespoonful of Butter or Lard. 

1 Pint of Milk (Buttermilk if Possibloi. 

1 Teaspoonful of Salt. 

Scald the meal with boiling water suf- 
ficient to melt. Beat the yolks of the 
eggs very, very light. Add the corn meal 
and melted butter, and the salt, and beat 
till very light, moistening with the miU^. 
Then add the whites of the eggs, beat'in 
to a stiff froth. Beat all well together. 
Pour into a buttered or greased pan, or 
Into shallow tins, and bake quickly. This 
is the real Creole Corn Bread, so highly 
-praised by all tourists through Louisiana. 
'The secret of the exquisite flavor depends 
Tipon the proper beating of the eggs, as 
■well as on the rising of the com bread 
Itself. If the eggs are well beaten, the 
corn bread will need neither soda nor 
yeast to make it rise properly. Some add 
a tablespoonful of sugar when they wish 
to have sweetened corn bread. Corn 
bread, to be delicious, should always be 
served hot aJid generously buttered. 

Nonpareil Com Bread. 

Pain de Mais Nonpariel. 

2 Cups of Indian Meal. 

1 Cup of Flour. 3 Eggs. 

2 1-2 Cups of Sweet Milk. 
1 Tablespoonful of Lard. 

2 Tablespoonfuls of Sugar (if Desired). 

2 Teaspoonfuls of Baking Powder. 

1 Teaspoonful of Salt. 

Beat the eggs very, very light, the 
whites and yolks separately. Melt the 
lard or butter, and sift the Baking Pow - 
der into the sifted meal end flour. S .ir 
this into the yolks of the eggs and the 
milk. Blend thoroughly. Add the whites, 
beaten to a stiff froth. Beat well to- 
gether, and bake quickly and steadily 



in a quick oven for about a half hour. 
Serve hot, with butter. 

Risen Corn Bread. 
Pain de Mais au Levain. 

1 Quart of Cornmeal. 
1 Pint of Milk or Water. 3 Eggs. 

1 Teaspoonful of Salt. 

2 Tablespoonfuls of Teast. 

Beat the eggs well, and use boiling 
water or milk to blend the cornmeal, eg^3 
and salt together. Then add the yeasit, 
which you will have dissolved in a little 
hot water. Set the bread to rise for thres 
or four hours, and then bake in tins or 
in a greased pan, like a pone of bread, 
or make it into loaves. 

Again, the risen corn bread can be 
made much more quickly by simply add- 
ing two tablespoonfuls of yeast powder 
to the batter, or a half teaspoonfuA of 
soda, dissolved in a cup of milk. Mix 
thoroughly, and bake in buttered tins or 
a pan. Always scald the meal with boil- 
ing water first. 

Steamed Corn Bread. 

Pain de Mais a la Vapeur. 

1 Cup of Fllour. 
1 Cup of Louisiana Molasses. 

2 Cups of Sweet Milk. 

2 Teaspoonfuls of Baking Powder. 

Scald the meal. Beat the eggs very 
light, and beat the milk into them till 
very light. Add the molasses and yeast 
powder, and blend well. Then add the 
flour, mixing and beating till thoroughly 
blended. A half cup of sugar may be 
used instead of the molasses. Tie in a 
cloth, as you would roll a pudding, and 
place in a steamer, on top of a pot of 
boiling water, and cover first with a close 
cloth, and then with the steamer cover, 
and steam for three hours. Then turn 
into a hot dish, and eat as a plain des- 
sert, with a Brandy or Hard or Cream 
Sauce. (See Pudding Sauces.) 

Cornmeal Pone, 

Pain de Mais Creole. 

1 Quart of the Finest Indian Meal. 

1 Teaspoonful of Salt. 

A Heaping Teaspoonful of Lard or 

Butter. 

1 Pint of Sour Milk or Buttermilk. 

3 Eggs. 

Pour Just enough boiling water over 
the meal to scald it through and through, 
without making a dough or batter. Stir 
it well, and let it grow tepid. It will be 
then quite dry. Beat two eggs very light, 
and add to the meal, and add a melted 
tablespoonful of lard or butter. Mix thiS 
well, and add the milk or buttermilk, and 
beat till the batter is very smooth. Dis- 
solve one teaspoonful of soda In a little 
boiling water, and add to the mixture, 
and grease a baking pan. Turn the mix- 
ture in and bake in a quick oven for 
about thirty-five minutes, till a golden 
brown. Take the pone from the pan 
whole, and place on a hot platter, and 
serve, cutting it at the table into slices 
about three Inches long and two wide, 
and serving with butter. 

A Plain Pone may be made by uslns 
hot water and lard, instead of milk and 
butter, making a thick dough, and form 
into loaves and bake. But It bears no 
comparison to the real Oeole Pone, ai 
made above. Nevertheless, this is a very 
good and nutritious white corn bread. 
In the rural districts of Louisiana the 
lard is often omitted, and the pone made 
simply of the hot water and cornmeal. 



267 



Corn Dodgrers. 

Petits Pain de Mais. 

1 Quart of Indian Meal. 

1 Tablespoonful of Lard. 

1 Teaspoonful of Salt. 

Scald the meal with boiling water. Add 
the melted lard and the salt. Use suffi- 
cient boiling water to make a very stiff 
batter or so'ft dough. Then take up a 
handful of the mixture, and mold it with 
your hands into oval mounds, tossing the 
cake of dough lightly between your hands 
in a dexterous manner, and leaving the 
impression of your fingers across. Bake 
the pones thus formed in a quick oven. 
They may be served at dinner, and a;-e 
delicious when properly made. 

Ash Cake. 

Petits Gateaux Cuits dans la Cendre. 

1 Quart of Indian Meal. 

1 Tablespoonful of I^rd. 

1 Teaspoonful of Salt. 

This is a real old Southern darky cake. 
The ancient Creole negroes of Louisiana 
excelled in making and baking it, so that 
no ashes clung to the clean white cake. 
An ash cake, as the name suggests, is 
always baked in the ashes, on the open 
hearth, and wood ashes must be used. 
The darkies had a roaring fire and a 
sufficient quantity of hot ashes. They 
swept a clean place on the hearth and 
drew out a pile of hot ashes and placed 
the pone of bread, shaped like the Com 
Dodgers, on top of the ashes. This was 
covered with hot ashes, and let bake to 
a nice brown. Then the cake was drawn 
out of the ashes, wiped clean with a cloth 
till every particle of ashes that adhered 
in 'the crevices disappeared, and served 
hot with butter or molasses. 

Again, the old Creole darkies wrap 
the cake in a layer of fig leaves, to bake 
more neatly, but the real Ash Cake is 
baked as above. 

Fried Corn Cakes. 
Gateau de Mais Frits. 

1 Quart of Indian Meal. 

1 Tablespoonful of Lard. 

1 Teaspoonful of Salt. 

Make the dough as above, adding. If 
you wish, a well-beaten egg, and milk In- 
stead of water. Beat till very light, and 
drop the stiff batter in large spoonfuls 
on a frying pan that you will have 
greased well with fat bacon skin. These 
cakes are very delicious when properly 
made. They must be fried to a golden 
brown. After each cake is taken from 
the skillet, the latter must be wiped off 
and regreased with the fat bacon before 
putting the next cake upon it. Serve 
hot at breakfast or dinner. 
HOECAKE. 
Gateau a la Houe. 

1 Pint of Flour. 

1-2 Teaspoonful of Salt. 

Boiling Water Sufficient to Make a. 

Batter. 

These cakes may be baked on a grid- 
dle, just as you would a griddle cake, 
and served with butter. But the old 
Southern cooks, of which the Louisiana 
Creole plantation cooks were not the 
least, always baked these cakes on a hoe 
on hot coals in front of a wood fire, right 
out in the open air, before their cabin 
doors, or in their cabins before the roar- 
ing hearth fire. Hence the name Hoe- 
cake. The Hoecake was made of flour, 
with sufficient water to moisten It well. 



A teaspoonful of butter or lard was 
added. 

The term Hoecake, so extensively used 
by the field hands, was taken up by mas- 
ters and mistresses, and applied to a bis- 
cuit bread made of one pint of flour, 
one-half pint of milk, one teaspoonful of 
yeast powder, and two spoonfuls of but- 
ter or one of lard, kneaded well to- 
gether, rolled out with a rolling pin, and 
cut criss-cross, like diamonds, with a 
knife, and baked in the oven. 

This delightful refinement of the an- 
cient Hoecake is served at dinner with a. 
glass of milk or cream, as an accompani- 
ment to Compotes of Fruits. 

JOHNNY CAKE. 

11-2 Pints of Indian Meal. 3 Eggs 
A Pint of Sweet Milk or Buttermilk or 

Hot Water. 

2 Tablespoonfuls of Melted Butter, or 1 

of Lard. 

1-2 Teaspoonful of Soda (May be 

Omitted). 

Beat the eggs till very light, and add 
the cornmeal, and beat till light. Add 
the melted butter and the milk or water. 
If buttermilk is used, you may use the 
soda, dissolving it in two tablespoonfuls 
of boiling water. Do not use the soda 
with the sweet milk. Make a dough or 
batter thick enough to be spread into 
cakes a half inch in thickness and about 
five inches in diameter, the cakes, of 
course, being formed round. Place in 
buttered tins, and bake in a moderate 
oven for about a half hour, frequently 
brushing across while baking with melt- 
ed butter. Do this about four or five 
times. 

In the olden days, Johnny Cake was 
baked on a clean, sweet board, before 
a hot coal fire. The board had to be 
made of oak wood. The cake was formed 
and placed on the board, and the board 
was inclined at an angle before the hot 
coal fire, with a piece of wood or a flat- 
iron to hold it up, and the cake "was 
placed at such an angle that it could 
harden without slipping off. WTien quite 
hard it was stood upright and baked to 
a nice, crisp brown on both sides, turning 
as needed, and frequently basting with 
butter. The Johnny Cake was served hot 
for lunch or tea, being sent to the table 
hot, split and buttered, or served with 
fresh, sweet butter and buttermilk. 

CRACKLING BREAD. 

Gratons. 

Cracklings are the bits of fat meat 
left after all the lard has been rendered 
from the fat pork. They are eaten ex- 
tensively throughout rural Creole Lou- 
isiana. The fat pork is cut into small 
bits, about the size of a man's hand, 
and then fried till every bit of grease 
has been extracted. This grease is then 
clarified and used as lard. The cracklings 
are saved, and eaten from time to time 
within the next two weeks, simply beln.5 
warmed over again. Again, they may ba 
made at any time by frying small bits of 
fat pork. These cracklings, to use he 
country parlance, "Go very well witn 
Corn Bread," and are not only eaten with 
it "au naturel," but also made into that 
typical rural bread of the country par- 
ishes, "Crackling Bread," or "Gratons. ' 

To make this, take one pint of meal, a 
half teaspoonful of salt, and cold water 
enough to make a thick batter. Mix the 
cracklings, already fried, of course, in a 
batter, and pour a large tablespoonful at 
a time on a griddle. Fry to a golden 
brown. Crackling bread is very crisp. 



268 



and if properly made Is a very palatable 
bread, requiring no butter or other ac- 
companiment to make it toothsome.

your fingers, and butter nicely. 

SALLiY LUNN. 

Pain a la Vielle Tante Zoe. 
Sally Lunn is nothing more than the 
old breakfast dish known to the Creole*^ 
for generations as "Pain a la Vielle de 
Tante Zoe." Take 

1 Pint of Milk. 

11-2 Pints of Flour. 

1-2 Cupful of Butter. 

4 Eggs. 1 Teaspoonful of Salt. 

1-2 Cup of Sugar. 

1-4 Cake of Compressed Teast. 

Warm the butter in a pint of milk till 
the milk reaches the boiling point. D-> 
not let it boil. Simply scald. Then aid 
the salt and a tablespoonful of sugar. 
Let it cool. When tepid add the flour, 
well sifted, and beat thoroughly into the 
mixture. Lastly add the yeast, dissolved 
in a little hot milk or water. Beat it con- 
tinuously for at least five minutes. Then, 
when the batter begins to break into 
blisters, cover it and set to rise for the 
night. In the morning add the yolks of 
the eggs, beaten till very light, and the 
whites, beaten to a stiff froth. Mix care- 
fully, and dissolve a half teaspoonful of 
soda in the mixture, if it seems anyway 
sour. Turn the whole into a shallow but- 
tered dish, and set to rise for fifteen min- 
utes longer. Bake about twenty or 
twenty-five minutes in a moderateJy 
quick oven, till it is a light brown. 

This cake, like all muffin batter, should 
not be cut with a knife, but torn apart 
with your hands. It cut, all muffin bat- 
ter at once becomes heavy. The cake 
may be also made much more quickly 
by mixing in the morning, using the 
above ingredients, only adding three tea- 
spoonfuls of baking powder, instead of 
the yeast. Beat quickly and thoroughly, 
and turn into a buttered tin, and set to 
bake at once. Send to the table hot, and 
eat with a generous endowment of but- 
ter. 

WAFFLES. 

Gaufres. 

Waffles are delightful accompanimentii 
of breakfast, lunch or tea, and may be 
made of flour, rice, hominy or cornmeal. 
In all recipes for Waffles, if you have 
not the milk, substitute lukewarm water, 
and if you have no butter, use instead a 
half spoon of lard, but certainly the taste 
of the W^affles is much improved by the 
butter and milk, especially the butter. 
Half milk and half -water, boiled and 
grown tepid, may also be used in the 
proportions indicated in the recipes. 

Plain Waffles. 

Gaufres de Froment.

der together. Beat the yolk of the egs 
till very light. Add the melted butter to 
the milk, which should be scalded and 
grown lukewarm, and then mix in the 
whites of the eggs. Now add the flour 
gradually, making a nice, light batter.

milk. Have your waffle irons readv, 
thoroughly heated. Have at hand a small 
brush or a stick with a piece of clean, 
fringed cloth wrapped around the end. 
Dip this in a little melted lard, and brush 
over the interior of the irons, till every 
part is greased. Pour the batter into a 
pitcher, so that you may the more easily 
fill the irons. Fill until the elevations 
are lightly covered, and then close tl'.e 
irons quickly and turn it over. Bake the 
Waffle about two minutes, or till a nice, 
delicate brown. Carefully remove from 
the irons, place in a hot plate or waifle 
dish in the mouth of the oven, and pro- 
ceed with the baking. Send to the table

spoon. Have ready the hot grlddl&J, 
which you will grease with lard lightly, 
or, better still, with a piece of fat bacon. 
Drop the cakes on the griddle from a 
large spoon, and bake about two minutes

half teaspoontul of soda, instead of the 
baking powder. 

BUCKWHEAT CAKES. 

Galettes de Sarrasin. 

S Cups of Buckwheat Flour (Perfectly

er, and put the warm milk or water, or 
half milk and water, into It, and then 
add the salt and the buckwheat flour. 
Beat till perfectly smooth, and then, 
when you have a stiff batter, add the 
yeast, dissolved in a little water. Beat 
this till smooth, and then cover well and 
set to rise over night. In the morning 
add a half teaspoonful of soda or salera- 
tus, to remove any sourness that may 
have accrued during the night, and this 
addition will also increase the lightness 
of the cakes. Bake on a griddle, like 
Batter Cakes. *

by taking two cups of buckwheat flour, 
one cup of "wheat flour, one and three- 
quarters pints of milk, one teaspoonful 
of salt, three teaspoonfuls of baking pow- 
der, and mixing all together till very 
light, and baking immediately on grid- 
dles. Many, indeed, prefer them com- 
bined with the flour. This mixture may 
also b" made as in the above recipe, by 
using compressed yeast, and setting to 
rise over night. A tablespoonful of but- 
ter may also be added if desired. Serve 
with Louisiana Syrup.

at the start to allow for the admixture 
of the eggs and butter in the morning. 
When once the cakes have risen, no 
flour must be added, unless the cakes are 
set to rise for an hour again. 

Sweet Flannel Cakes are made by add- 
ing a half cup of sugar. These are nice

flour to make a good batter, and set the 
mixture on the stove for a few mlnutei, 
till the flour is well scalded. Do not let 
it boil or simmer under any considera- 
tion. Take It from the fire, and let It 
cool. Then mash the potatoes and add 
them to the flour, and add a half cup of 
sugar and a half cup of yeast. Let It 
stand in a warm place till It has thor- 
oughly risen. Then add cornmeal that 
has been sifted and dried, and knead 
well, until you have a dough thick 
enough to roll out, and that will crumble 
when dry. Cut- this dough Into cakes, 
and spread on a board and place In the 
shade to dry. Then keep in a box in a, 
dry place. 

This mixture may be also kept and used 
as a liquid by simply stopping when you 
have come to the point where you must 
add the cornmeal. Let the mixture thua 
stand in a warm place till it has thor- 
oiighly risen. Then scald a large jar, 
wipe dry, and put in the yeast. Cover 
tight, and keep in a cool place. One- 
third of a cupful of yeast will make two 
loaves of bread. 



CHAPTER XLVm. 
SUGGESTIONS TO HOUSBKEiBPERS. 



The following suggestions will be found 
of interest to all housekeepers, especially 
to the young and Inexperienced. They 
have been carefully prepared, with espe- 
cial reference to the needs or the house- 
hold, and bear in every respect upon the 
recipes given in The Times-Picayune's 
Creole Cook Book: 

Conriparatlve Table .of .Weights .and 

Measures Used In The Times-Ploa- 

ynne's Creole Cook Book. 

Every housekeeper should have for her 
own convenience and for the correct 
measurement of ingredients used In mak- 
ing any dish, where exact measurements 



are absolutely necessary to success, a pair 
of scales, and a set of tin measures wifl 
small lips or spouts; these measures 
should range from one gallon to a half 
gill. But as so few housekeepers think of 
the necessity of having such measures 
until they set to making preparations 
where measurements must be exact, the 
following carefully prepared table may be 
referred to with absolute reliance upon 
the comparative quantities given: 

Twenty-five drops of thin liquid equal 
half a teaspoonful. 

Four teaspoonfuls of solid or liquid 
equal one tablespoonful of solid or liquid. 



273 



Pour tablespoonfuls equal one wine- 
glassful or one-half gill. 

One wineglassful equals half u gill or 
a quarter of a cup. 

Two wineglassfuls equal one gill, or 
half a cup. 

Two gills equal one teacupful, or six- 
teen tablespoonfuls. 

One teacupful or one kitchen cupful 
equals half a pint. 

Two teacuptuls or two kitchen cupfu.'a 
equal one pint. 

Two pints equal one quart. 

Four quarts equal one gallon. 

One tablespoonful of liquid equals half 
an ounce. 

Two tablespoonfuls equal one ounce. 

One level tablespoonful of flour equals 
half an ounce. 

Two level tablespoonfuls solid equal one 
ounce liquid. 

Sixteen ounces equal one pound. 

One pound of solid is equal to one pint 
of liquid. 

One quart of unsifted flour equals one 
pound. 

Four teacupfuls of sifted flour equal 
one pound. 

Three cups of cornmeal equal one 
pound. 

One and one-half pints of cornmeal 
equal one pound. 

One pint or two cups of granulated 
sugar equal one pound. 

One pint or two cups of brown sugar 
equW one pound. 

Two and one-half oupfuls of white pul 
verized sugar equal one pound. , 

One well-rounded tablespoonful of but- 
ter equals one ounce. 

One tablespoonful of salt equals one 
ounce. 

One teacupful of cold, hard butter, 
pressed down, equals half a pound, 
equal one pound. 

Two cups of cold butter, pressed down. 

One pint of finely-chopped meat, solid- 
ly packed, equals one pound. 

An ordinary-sized tumblerful is equpl 
to half a pint, or one teacupful. 

Ten eggs equal one pound. 

A dash of pepper Is equal to one-elgh'i 
of a teaspoonful. 

Rules to be Observed In Mixing 
Ingredients. 

In every recipe given in this book fol- 
low Implicitly the exact order given for 
the mixing of ingredients. This mixing 
has been systematically arranged, and 
any deviation will fail of success. Do 
not think that you can put all your in- 
gredients together pell-mell and succewi 
in making any Ci'eole dish. Whether 
mixing the Ingredients in a "Roux," pre- 
paratory to adding the ingredient which 
constitutes the dish' proper, or whether 
making desserts, cakes, etc., add every 
Ingredient, even though It be only a dash 
of pepper or a flavoring extract, in the 
exact order and proportion given. On 
the strict observance of these rules fol- 
lowed by Creole cuisinieres, depends the 
success of Creole Cookery. 

Ontting, Chopping, Slicing and Mincing. 

Observe implicitly the directions given 
in regard to cutting, chopping, slicing 
and mincing, whether applied to vegeta- 
bles, meats or seasonings. 

When the Times-Picayune Creole Cook 
Book says to chop an Ingredient, it means 
to chop in the strict sense of the word. 
WTien it directs that vegetables, etc.. 
shall be cut. It means to cut, in the 
proper acceptation of that term in coolc- 
ery. When it says to slice. It means thJ.t 
the Ingredient shall be sliced, and not cut 



or chopped; and so when the terra 
"mince" is used, it means that the in- 
gredient shall be minced, or hasiied, or 
grated, as fine as possible. 
The Use of Wines and Liiquorg in The 
Times-Picayune's Creole Cook Book. 

In regard to the use of Wines and 
Liquors in cooking, it may be said that 
wine enters frequently into the prepara- 
tion cf Creole dishes, such as meat, stewa, 
courtbouillons, etc. In all recipes, how- 
ever, where its use is indicated in this 
book, it may be omitted, according to 
taste, without detriment to the dish, ex- 
cept in "Courtbouillon a la Creole," the 
famous "Bouilliabaisse," and in all Mate- 
lotes, in Salmi of Venison, and in certain 
preparations of meats and poultry and 
game in which the success of the dish 
depends greatly upon the flavoring given 
by a small addition of wine. But, as a 
general rule, wine may be used or omit- 
ted according to the taste. This explana- 
tion is given because there are naany 
lamilies, Creole and otherwise, who ob- 
ject to the use of wine, even In cooking. 

As regards Wine, Brandy and Hum in 
Sauces for Puddings, etc., a variety of 
recipes that are equally recherche and in 
which liquors of no kind are used, are 
specified in this book. The intelligent 
housekeeper, therefore, will find a varied 
and pleasing selection with or without 
wine or liquors. 

The Use of Broth, Bonlllon or Oon- 
sonune in Cooking. 

What has been said in regard to Wines 
and Liquors holds good with regard to 
the use of Broth, Bouillon or Consomme, 
indicated in many of the recipes for fish, 
meats, poultry, etc. While the infusion 
of Broth, Bouillon or Consomme, or oys- 
ter water in lieu of plain water, adda, 
where indicated, a delightful flavor to the 
dish, the use of any of these Is not im- 
perative in making the dish, and w'ater, 
in the proportion given for Broth or Con- 
sonime, may always be used Instead, ex- 
cept in special recipes. For Instance, if 
you wish to have a real "Jambalaya a la 
Creole," the use of Broth or Consomme 
Instead of water, where the Jambalaya 
is made of meats, and the use of oyster 
water where it is made of oysters, will 
impart a flavor that is far superior to a 
dish prepared with water. Nevertheless, 
In hundreds of households water is used 
almost exclusively, even in making a 
jambalaya, because it is not every family 
that chooses to make a pot of Broth or 
Consomme just for the purpose of using 
it as an ingredient for a dish, and In our 
climate It Is not possible to always keep 
a quantity of meat or tish stock on hand 
for culinary purposes. 

Never be afraid, therefore to undertake 
a dish because it calls for Wine or Bouil- 
lon or Consomme. Just proceed with the 
cooking, using water Instead, and If your 
seasoning is good, and other directions 
implicitly followed in the preparation and 
cooking, the absence of either Wine or 
Consomme will scarcely be detected by 
even the most experienced cook or epi- 
cure. 

Explanation of French Terms Used in 
Cooking and Serving Dishes. 

In preparing the Creole Cook Book The 
Times-Picayune has sought to overcome 
the great difficulty that the majority of 
people outside of Louisiana experience In 
understanding French terms, as applied 
to various dishes and orders of service. 
Discussions have been going on in all 
parts of the country of late as to the de- 



274 



sirability of abolishing all French terns 
on bills of fare, one celebrated newspa- 
per declaring: "What is the use of call- 
ing a dish 'Canard Canvasback,' wheu 
there is no French name for the famous 
Canvas-back Duck?" All this is very 
amusing down here in Louisiana, where 
the Canvas-back Duck has been always 
known as the "Canard de Cheval." And 
so with other dishes. The use of French, 
however, continues in bills of fare pre- 
pared for all distinguished banquets, etc., 
critics tc the contrary notwithstanding, 
and will continue, because the French or- 
der of service is the one accepted the 
world over, in all state and official gath- 
erings, and the pretty touch given to a 
dish called by a French name is one that 
ladies especially will be slow to give up. 
An air of distinction is conferred upon 
even a homely dish by calling it by its 
French name, and, as remarked above, 
all criticisms against the practice will not 
do away with the usage. 

The Times-Picayune has sought to over- 
come the difficulty experienced by those 
who are not acquainted with the French 
language and French terms in cooking by 
giving with each recipe not only the cor- 
rect English name of the dish, but the 
French one also. It now proposes to fur- 
ther assist housekeepers and caterers 
generally by giving the definitions of a 
few additional French terms used in 
cooking and serving dishes: 

Assaissonement — A Seasoning; a salad 
dressing. 

Assaissonnement Aromatique — ^An aro- 
matic seasoning, such as parsley, chervil,

for Bouilliabaisse.) 

Braise — To smother. All meats, fish, 
vegetables, etc., cooked in a closely-cov- 
ered stewpan, so as to retain not only

IiUNCHEON. 

Gouter. 

Perhaps no meal admits of such Infi- 
nite variety as luncheon. Almost anything: 
may be served for luncheon, from cold 
left-over meats, fish, etc., and all hors 
d'o-euvres and salads to desserts. Tea, 
coffee, cocoa, chocolate, iced lemonade, 
and almost all iced summer drinks, a.i 
well as fruits, are served acceptably at 
luncheon. Hot or cold bread may be 
served, as also forms of breakfast cakes 
and syrups. 

The order of service varies. For in- 
stance, fruits may be served at the be- 
ginning of the meal, or as a dessert at 
the close, and so also with watermelons 
and muskmelons. 

DINNEB. 

Diner. 

The Creoles divide dinners into threa 
classes: The dinner of one course, of two 
courses, and of three courses. The first 
they have appropriately named "Am- 
bigu," because it admits of all dishes 
being brought to the table at the same 
time, from the soups to the desserts, and 
dishes are confo-unded. Among wealthy 
classes, the "Ambigu" is a dinner served 
hastily at night, after a theater or oper* 
party, or otherwise, coming in from a 
soiree, but among the poorer classes the 
"Ambigu" is made a very pleasant meal. 
Hors d'oeuvres and such desserts as 
cakes and fruits are placed on the table 
before the family is seated, and the soup 
is served as a "Releve," all the other 
dishes, from the roasts to the entrees 
and entremets and entremets sucres and 
salad, being placed on the table at tha 
same time. Jellies, fruits and cake com- 
pensate for the absence of elaborate dei- 
serts, and the vegetables and sauces are 
few. Properly served, as is done dally 
in many a Creole home, an "Ambigu' 
may become an elegant and distinguished 
repast, though the viands are plain and 
simple. 

In dinners of two courses the soup 
is again the "Releve," and the fish or 
meats and all the vegetables, entremets 
anu entrees, and also the salad, constitute 
the first course. Salads, as a rule, should 
always be served with the roasts. The 
desserts constitute the second course. 

In dinners of three courses, following 
always the French order of arrange- 
ment, which has always been observed 
m elegant Creole homes, the following 
la the order of service: 

First Course — Soup or Gumbo, Hors 
d Oeuvres. 

Second Course— Fish (and with fish are 
always served potatoes in any form), Re- 
leves (where another dish Is desired). 
Entrees, Coup de MUlieu (a middle iced 
drink), Rotis or Roasts, Vegetables, B.i- 
tremets. Salads, Entremets S'ucrea. 

Third Course — Desserts, Compotes, Pui- 
dings, Pies, Cakes, Pieces Montees, Ices 
Fruits, Petit Fours, Cheese, Coffee.

The following constitutes the list o'

How to utilize lieft-Over I'ood. 

Never throw away scraps of bread or 
broken crusts or stale bread. Take all 
the broken pieces and brown them In 
the stove, and roll them on the bread 
board till grated fine, and sift through 
a coarse sieve. Again roll the crumbs 
that remain in the sieve, and sift as be- 
fore. Put them all into a jar and cover, 
and keep ,them for use In cooking. A 
box of bread crumbs for dishes prepared 
*'au Gratin" is indispensable in a kitchen. 

Left-over stale bread is also used in 
making Bread Paddings, Bread Muffins, 
Queen Pudding, etc. 

Use all broken pieces of cakes in mak- 
ing puddings, such as Banana Souffle, 
9,nd all Cake Puddings. 

All Gold left-over mashed potatoes may 
be used for making Croquettes or Puffs 
or Quenelles of Potatoes. Cold boiled 
potatoes left over may be utilized in pre- 
paring Lyonnaise Potatoes or Frencn 
Fried Potatoes. 

Left-over Greens may be used in mak- 
ing Salads. Left-over fish and chicken 
may be used in making Fish or Chicken 
Salad a la Myonnaise. 

Left-over meat, whether veal, mutton 
or beef, may be used in making Hash 
Croquettes or Boulettes. 

Save all fat drippings and bits of fat 
meat and bacon skin. The former are 
excellent for frying fritters and dough- 
nuts and pancakes; the latter for greas- 
ing the griddle for com cakes, etc. 

Keep all coarse, rough ends of beef- 
steak or sirloin, or the ends of tenderloin 
steaks. They make excellent stews or 
croquettes of meat balls. 

The remains of yesterday's roast beef 
or mutton may be utilized In croquettes 
for breakfast, or cecils or cold meat for 
luncheon. 

Remains of turkey or chicken or rabbit 
may be used in making Gumbos. 

Save all left-over rice for Riz au Lait, 
griddle cakes, Calas, Jambalaya, etc. 

All left-over cold boiled meat from sojp 
may be used for Beef Hash. 

When you have finished with the ham 
bone, do not throw it away, but after 
chipping all the meat off for "Frizzled 
Ham," boil the bone with cabbage or 
turnip or other vegetable greens, or witn 
red or white beans or lentils. It gives 



a flavor to these dishes that they wiU 
not otherwise have. 

Keep all the green parts of the Celery 
tips that do not miake a beautiful dec- 
oration at the table when celery Is served 
and use for flavoring for soups, salads, 
stews, etc. 

Turnips and beans left over from yes- 
terday may be made into a puree for din- 
ner next day. 

Keep all pieces of Plain or Puff Pas+e 
that are trimmed from the pies or pat- 
ties. Roll them over again, cut into 
pretty squares, and serve at supper with 
preserves spread over them. Or simply 
put in the ice box and use the next dd.y 
in making Rissoles with left-over meat. 

When making Gold Cake, save the 
Whites of the eggs for Silver Cake. Or 
they may be used for making Angel Cake. 
Apple Snow, and all other forms of des- 
serts in which Meringues are called for. 

Finally, do not waste anything in the 
kitchen. Our grandmcthers scrupulous- 
ly saved every piece of bone or fat, and 
these were utilized in making soft soap. 

The careful housekeeper -will manage 
to keep out of debt and set a good table, 
with much variety, on a small allowance, 
Oy faithfully saving and utilizing the 
left-overs. 

Invalid Cookery. 

It has not been thought necessary to 
add a chapter on "Invalid Cookery" in 
this book, as all Creoles know how to 
prepare dainty articles of diet for the 
sick. Invalid cookery, moreover, does 
not differ much from the general house- 
hold cookery, and all recipes given In 
this book for Bouillons, Oyster S'oups, 
delicate Purees, Chicken Broth, Toasts, 
Broiled Chicken and Birds, Broiled Ten- 
derloin Steak, delicate Custards, such as 
Milk Custards, Riz au Lait, Blano 
Mange, Jellies, Gruels, Porridge, Egg 
Toasts, Fruit Waters, Mint Julips, Coh- 
blers. Egg Nogg, Blackberry Cordials, 
etc.; delicate ways of serving oranges 
and other fruits — in fact, almost anything 
that may be ordered by a physician, from 
a Beef Broth or Oyster Soup to Milk 
Toast or Charlotte Russe, may be found 
in The Times-Picayune Creole Cook Book. 
Reference has only to be made to the in- 
dex, and with a slight reduction of quan- 
tity in all proportions, say about one- 
lourth, for a dish intended for one per- 
son, -where Custards, etc., are indicated, 
the dish may be prepared. 

The serving is the most important point 
after cooking. Never crowd a dish in- 
tended for an invalid. Spread a dainty 
napkin on the salver. Arrange the food 
in a most appetizing way, lay a rosebud 
or a flower fresh from the garden on the 
salver, and bring in the dainty, tempting 
morsel with a happy, cheery smile, 
though your heart may be sinking. The ' 
dish, in nine oases out of ten, will not fall 
to please, Tvhile your sunny smile will en- 
courage the patient, and make him or her 
feel that recovery is certain. Then the 
battle is half won. 



CHAPTER XlilX. 



VARIETIES OF SEASONABLE FOODS FOUND IN THE NEW ORLEANS 
MARKET DURING THE TEAR. 



How often is the complaint heard from 
the busy, tired housekeeper: "My hu'i- 
band and children are so tired of eating 
the same things, day in and day out; I 
really do not know what to give them 
for a change in diet!" 

This is a complaint that shOTiId never 
be heard in the latitude of New Orleang, 



where nature is so prolific; where at all 
seasons of the year some dainty bit of 
game, poultry or meat is to be had at 
wonderfully low prices; -where our rivers 
and lakes are stocked with the finest fish 
from January to December, and where 
our spring and autumn crops of vegeLa- 
bles and fruits, the former running all 



278 



through the summer, the latter to the 
verge of the succeeding spring, make jt 
possible for even the poorest family to 
enjoy variety and delicacy of viands at 
each daily meal. 

The Creoles have an old adage that 
"Nature itself tells us what to eat,'' in 
the various vegetables and fruits of each 
season, and in the varieties of fish and 
flesh meat that are particularly adapted 
to each season. As the months wane, 
and a new season dawns, the good Creole 
housekeeper, even of unlimited means, 
far from trusting entirely to servants to 
do the marketing, makes it her duty to 
take a leisurely stroll through the French 
Market, where all the first fruits, vegeta- 
bles, fish and game of the season are 
to be found, and she takes her own men- 
tal notes, and knows just what to order 
when her cook comes for the daily inter- 
view. Again, many of the most famous 
housekeepers do their own marketing en^ 
tirelv. and it is not an uncommon thing 
to see Madame or Mademoiselle going to 
market every morning, followed by some 
faithful old domestic who may still ad- 
here to the fortunes of the family. 

For the convenience of housekeepers 
generally, however, we will close this 
Creole Cook Book by giving for each 
month in the year the varieties of season- 
able foods to be found In our latitude. 
By a simple daily reference to this list, 
the housewife may at once make her se- 
lections for the daily menu. With slight 
modifications Incident to climate and 

firoductions, the list may be useful In a.ny 
atitude. Again, to facilitate the choice 
of the housekeeper as to viands, a daily 
menu is given for one week, as also for 
great festivals, such as Christmas, New 
Year's, Easter and Thanksgiving Day.

winter and reared under shelter, and fed 
almost entirely on milk. It is killed in 
the spring, generally at Easter time, and

Easter dinner. It is a great delicacy, but 
Lamb that is not over six months ol-l 
makes' good eating.)

latter part of April, when kept standing 
for any length of time, and are, conse- 
quently, not eaten by the Creoles, unless 
they are ajt the lakeside, where the tooth- 
some bivalve is taken directly from the 
waters. From April till September, fol 
lowing the old adage that Oysters are 
good in every month in -which an "R" 
occurs, the Oysters will disappear from 
this list of seasonable fish. Nevertheless, 
in nearly all the large restaurants of New 
Orleans they are served.

This is a most interesting month In the 
New Orleans markets. "We have all the 
staple articles from the open ground, but 
besides Green (sweet) Peppers, Tomatoes 
and Eggplants, sown in November, and 
kept under glass until late in March, 
make their appearance in the marke*. 
The general crop of Green Peas is now 
in the market, and within the range of 
everybody's purse New Potatoes are 
quite plentiful Snap Beans are grad- 
ually getting cheaper, and thousands o^ 



bushel boxes go by express every day to 
Northern points. Early Corn and Arti- 
chokes, from the Lower Coast of Louisi- 
ana, arrive with every boat. The market 
stands: New Potatoes, New Green Peas, 
Early Corn, Sweet Green Peppers, New 
Tomatoes, Eggplants, Hot Peppers, Snap 
Beans, and all the vegetables mentioned 
in the list for March. (See March Vege- 
tables.)

towards the 15th of April, if the weather 
is favorable. S'trawberries are now plen- 
tiful and cheap. Dewberries and Black- 
berries are brought in by the negroes iu 
large quantities, and the cry fills tie

During the month of May the New Or-

Snap Beans, Green Peas, Peas, Lentils, 
Cucumbers, Young Onions, Potatoes, etc. 
Tomatoes and Eggplants that have 
ripened in the open ground fill the stalls. 
Cabbage, which does not resist much 
heat or drought, grows scarce, as also 
celery. Otherwise the vegetables con- 
tinue in abundance, the same as found in 
the list for March. (See March Vege- 
tables.) 

Young Squash makes its appearance 
this month, and is plentiful. The first 
Muskmelons arrive in New Orleans from 
the parishes and gardens around the city 
towards the middle of May, and Water- 
melons come in fine and tempting at the 
close of May, Carloads of Creole Oniop;? 
and New Potatoes are shipped North.

The first peaches ripen together with 
the large-fruited Plums. In a week or so 
these fruits overrun the market. Figs 
begin to ripen towards the end of the

during April. Oranges, Bananas, Pine- 
apples, etc., continue plentiful.

JUNE.

Beef, Veal, Mutton, Lamb, Pork Is

The famous Pababotte makes Its ap- 
pearance this month, and remaliis a de- 
lightful article of food till the middle of 
October. In the months of August and 
September they are very fat and excel- 
lent and a game much prized by epicures 
and connoisseurs. Reed Birds, Grasseta, 
Robins, Larks, which are the terror or 
the rice planters, appear in abundance, 
and overrun the market.

Northern markets and is found in abun- 
dance. Butterbeans and Lima Beans ap-

of the June sun, and are soon within 
reach of everyone's purse. Pigs are plen- 
tiful, aBd are being bought up by the 
canning establishments, but almost all 
the ancient homes of New Orleans have 
fig trees In their gardens or yards, and 
the luscious tropical fruit is within the 
reach of all. Strawberries, Blackberries, 
Dewberries, Bananas, Oranges, Plneai>-

To use the familiar saying of the New 
Orleans dealers, "The "Watermelon is now 
the boss of the market." It is placed on 
ice and eaten at any hour of the day, be- 
ing most cooling and refreshing. Vege- 
tables produced with much hard work 
cannot now compete with the popularity 
of the Watermelon, which is a favorite 
with all classes, and is put on the market 
in such enormous quantities that they are 
almost given away. Carloads arrive each 
day from the parishes and from the truck 
farms around New Orleans, and they are 
bought up as fast as offered. One famous 
specimen, recently called the "Triumph,'* 
weighing from ninety to one hundred 
pounds, was found to be as sweet as 
honey. Other vegetables are the same as 
in June. (See June.)

August Is the poorest of all months for 
vegetables. The Snap Beans begin to get 
hard and stringy; and the lettuce soft 
under the rays of the sun. But people 
are quite content. Melons continue In

The Louisiana Orange has now con- 
quered the fruit market, and reigns su- 
preme over all other fruits. Thousands 
of trees planted since the terrible freeze 
of 1899, it may be incidentally mentioned, 
are now bearing fruit, and if spared for 
a few years will bring abundant returns 
to the Louisiana orange growers. It 
would seem that no fruit tree offers such 
inducements to the planter, and even If 
a freeze should kill the trees every six 
or eieht years, it still pays to grov? 
oranges in Louisiana. Among other fruits 
are Bananas, Pears, Pineapples, C^ierries,

The Louisiana Pecan now makes Its

A New Year's Decoration. 

On New Tear's Day, no matter how 
humble her circumstances, the Creole 
housewife will .have freshly bloomlnis 
roses on her table. In our delightful 
climate, where flowers bloom the year 
round, and where, in winter, especially, 
roses are in their zenith of glory, there 
are tew homes, indeed, in which a patdi 
of ground is not set aside for the cultiva- 
tion of flowers; while in the lovely open 
gardens in the "Garden District of New 
Orleans" roses in exquisite bloom over- 
run the trellises and arbors and smlJe 
upon you from the fancifully lald-om 
garden beds. It is wonderful how a bit 
of green, with a few roses nestling be- 
tween, will brighten up the homeliest 
table.

An £aster Decoration. 

On Easter Sunday the dinner table 
should always be decked with flowers, or 
at least some bit of green indicative not 
only of the resurrection of all nature, but 
also of the most glorious festival of the 
year. A beautiful decoration for those 
who can afford it is to arrange a cut- 
glass bowl on a mirror and fill it with 
Maiden-hair Fern and Calla Lilies. Fill 
the center of the Calla Lilies with sprays 
of Maiden-hair Fern; garnish the edges 
of the mirror with bits of fern and 
smilax, and the effect of all will be a 
miniature pond, with the lilies reflected 
within and the banks overrun wl'ih 
smilax. 

If this decoration is beyond your 
means, the home gardens are filled at 
this season with hyacinths, and violets, 
and narcissus. Smilax runs wild in our 
Louisiana woods, especially around New 
Orleans, and is to be had for the gath- 
ering. A bowl of hyacinths or violets, 
or sprays of roses, mingled with Maiden- 
hair fern or even a simple bowl of smilax, 
young mint and rose leaf greenery, will 
make the table beautiful, and whisper the 
Saster message to the heart.

A ThaQksg:ivine: Decoration. 

For the Thanksgiving table nothing Is 
more appropriate in the way of decora- 
tions than autumn leaves and berries. 
The woods at this seasc-n are full of beau- 
tiful trailing vines, of bronze and red; 
brilliant boughs, leaves, cones and ber- 
ries, all of which are most appropriate on 
this day, suggesting, by their wild lux- 
uriance and freedom of growth, the spirit 
of American liberty, which gave birth to 
the day. If it is cold, in lieu of the usual 
coal fire, light a blazing fire of pine 
knot, and you will have a glorious 
American illumination. 

The favors may consist of tiny Amer- 
ican flags, resting amid a cluster of 
autumn leaves and Maiden-hair Fern, Jf 
a formal dinner is given, the syra.- 
bol at our country may also be suggested 
in festoons of narrow red, white and blue 
streamers of ribbon, gracefully dropping 
from the chandeliers.

A ChriBtmas Decoration. 

On Christmas Day what is more beau- 
tiful and appropriate as a decoration 
than the holly? The woods are full of 
the beautiful Christmas offering of na- 
ture at this time of the year. Fill the 
vases and bowls with holly; hang a 
wreath above, the mantel, and set a great 
clustering bouquet in a low cutglass 
bowl in the center of the table. The 
brip-ht red berries against the dark green 
speak of the Christmas glow and cheer 
that fill the heart. 

An Old-Fashloned Creole Sn^sestion for 
Holiday Menus. 
The following old-fashioned Creole 
holiday menu, in vogue for generations 
among Creole families of moderate 
means, may be used by families whose 
means are very limited, but who, never- 
theless, with all the world, wish to en- 
Joy themselves, and give to those about 
them a little Christmas cheer. With a 
little modification, such as Roast Gloose 
with Apple Sauce, it may be within the 
means of the poor, and may serve for 
the Christmas, New Tear or Thanksgiv- 
ing Dinner. Mutton is always wiUiln 
the reaf'h of the poor in our market, and 
those families who cannot afford the 
traditional "Quarties d'Agneau Rotl, 
Sauce Menthe," at Easter, can always 
enjoy a good piece of Roast Lamb or 
Mutton from the brisket or shoulder.

8PECIAI. MENUS. 

Sagreestlons for Banqnets or Formal 
Dinners. 

In giving banquets, whether breakfasts, 
dinners or suppers, there is generally a 
tendency to overdo the menu. It should 
be borne in mind that to the Intelligent 
and refined nature there always conies the 
thought, "Man does not live by bread 
alone," and any attempt to over-feed by a 
too-lavish expenditure or number ot 
dishes not only displays a lack of elegant 
taste, but is positively vulgar. Too many 
courses spoil a feast, and what is In- 
tended to be an enjoyable, delightful re- 
union. It Is too often forgotten that all 
the guests are not gourmands, and that 
it does not require fifteen or twenty 
courses to satisfy all appetites. 

Again, too much wine is served, as a 
general rule. Where wines are served, 
remember that three kinds are sufficient 
for even the most costly and elegant 
menu — White wine (Sauternes), or Sherry 
with the soup; Sauternes With the fish: 
Claret with the entrees and roasts ; Cham- 
pagne just before the dessert is brought 
to the table. 

The following menus will serve as sug- 
gestions for the most elegant feasts:

Menu for Suppers. 

A supper is always a more elaborate a*- 
fair than a dinner. It admits of an ap 
petizer, Oysters on Half Shell, served as 
an hors d'oeuvre, cr Anchovies, Caviar-?, 
etc.; a Soup or Gumbo; the usual hors 
d'oeuvres of Celery, Radishes, Cress, 
Pickled Onions, Mangoes, Salted Al- 
monds, etc.; Fish, broiled, baked. Court- 
bouillon or Bouilliabaisse; vegetable at- 
tachments; entrees of various kinds, to 
suit the taste and alsc to correspond with 
the course of the feast; sweet entremets; 
a roast, vegetables, to be served with it, 
and salad; game of any variety, from 
Venison, Canvas-back, Mallard and Teal 
Ducks, to Pababottes, Snipe, Woodcock, 
etc., on toast; Desserts, Fruits, Jellies, 
Cheese, Coffee. 

The menu should always be varied ac- 
cording to the season, selecting always 
the first and most elegant fish, game, 
vegetables, fruits, etc., of the season 
to set before your guests. 

As a rule, any elegant dinner menu 
may serve also for a" supper, except In 
case of a state dining, and even then the 
rule given above should be observed. 

Do not overload vour table, and. above 
all, do not fatigue your guests with lonif- 



drawn-out affairs of eighteen and twenty 
courses. Observe the happy medium, ten 
and even less, and you and they will be 
the more satisfied, the more delighted, 
the more comfortable for your thoughtful 
and refined consideration. 

SOIREES. 

"Soirees" are pleasant forms of enter- 
tainments that have come down from ear- 
liest Creole days in Louisiana. While 
elaborate entertaining was also done, the 
Creole character being naturally gay and 
happy, and inheriting a French fondness 
for the dance, for music and song and so- 
cial intercourse, the young folks hal a 
way of giving weekly soirees, at which 
their parents served simple light refresh- 
ments, such as a famous "Sirops," given 
in the preceding chapter, ices of various 
kinds, lemonades and Petits Fours, or 
small cakes, waters and fruits. These 
refreshments were passed around by the 
old-time servants, decked in gay ban- 
dana tignon, guinea blue dress and wihite 
apron, and kerchief pinned across the 
bosom. Later in the evening tea was 
serveu. and as the "Soiree" advanced to 
the wee hours, coffee, chocolate and con- 
somme in cups. 

Fathers took the greatest interest in the 
"Soirees" in their homes, and did the 
honors with distinguished courtesy, in- 
viting the older gentlemen, who acted as 
escorts for their daughters, to take a 
glass of wine or champagne, but liquors 
were never offered to the young people, 
a custom that might well be adopted in 
our day generally. Ice Cream, Lemonade 
and Cakes, with a cup of Consomme or 
Cafe Noir, as the evening advanced, were 
considered sufficient refreshment. 

Again, at these "Soirees" the simple 
"Eau Sucre" was served (see "Eau Su- 
cre," under chapter on Domestic Drinks, 
Cordials, etc.) in the homes of families of 
most limited means. Lack of mc^ey has 
never debarred a Creole to the manor 
born from what is called the best society. 
These old-time "Soirees" still continue, 
though the "Eau Sucre" parties have 
passed away with changing conditions. 

The Creole "Soirees" are pleasing forms 
of entertainment that might be adopted 
with profit generally. 

ECONOMICAL MENUS. 

The following economical menus are in- 
tended as suggestions, showing how a 
family of six may live comfortably and 
witxi variety on from a dollar to a dollar 
and a half a day. In all these recipes the

another dainty form for the next, thus 
equalizing expenses from day to day:

ESTABLISHED IN 1837 



The Times-Picayune is the "Home" or 
"Family" newspaper of New Orleans, because 
it enjoys the confidence and esteem of the 
people. It stands for good government, the 
advancement of education, and protection for 
the home — for everything that is good — and 
is therefore popular with the women. 

Women active in civic, religious and 
philanthropic movements depend upon this 
newspaper for support, which they receive 
without stint. Its Sunday features include 
pages devoted to the activities of women in 
social, literary, religious, philanthropic and 
club work. 

It numbers among its regular daily feat- 
ures, appealing especially to women-federated 
and non-federated, organized and un-organ. 
ized — a page devoted to women with articles of 
interest to them. It is popular with women of 
Louisiana and Mississippi because it is clean 
and fearless, and sustains them in their en- 
deavors to attain higher standards in life and 
make living conditions better.
