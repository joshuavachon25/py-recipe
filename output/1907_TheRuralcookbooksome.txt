PREFACE 



For many years The R. N.-Y. has been collecting tested recipes from 
nn immense army of practicrti housewives. Some are entirely original; 
others are doubtless modifications of familiar practice. It is an easy 
matter to mislay a recipe not needed for immediate use, and we are thus 
often asked to repeat their publication, not once, but perhaps a dozen 
times. For this reasnn it seemed wise to print a selection of these recipes 
in permanent form, and "The Rural Cook Book" was decided upon, as 
a successor to "The Business Hen'' and "The Farmer's Garden." Before 
we had finished assembling our material, however, we discovered that we 
had enough recipes alone to till four books of the required size, and the 
question became not whnt to put in, but what to leave out. It was decided 
that we must give as much space as possible to canning, preserving, 
pickling, and other uses of fruit and vegetables, as such recipes are 
especially useful to farm housekeepers. This little book is not intended, 
to be a complete guide to domestic economy; in spite of its 
feel sure that it will be found a real practical helper, and 
we also think it will fill a place left vacant by many a more pretentious 
volume.

CHAPTER I. 



Here are Bome certain rules of beatlhi 

Tnlce thetD— they're better far than wealth : 

Don't overeat, don't overdrink, 

Don't overiTOTk, don't over Chink, 

Be not afraid ol honest aneat ; 

Bun like a deer from ahame and debt. 

BeiTsre of blsoesi of the bead. 

Get bigness of the soul Instead. 

Almond and Celery Soup. — Cut in small pieces a bunch of celery, 
using the leaves and carefully scraped root; add six peppercorns, two 
bay leaves, a tablespoonful of onion juice, a thin slice of lemon, a tea- 
spoonful of salt, and a stick of cinnamon; cover with a quart of water 
and cook an hour, strain and reheat, stirring in a cup of rich milk (^ream 
is better), a teaspoonful each of Hour and butter blended together, and 
one-quarter of a cup of blanched almonds that have been pounded to a 
paste, allowing soup to boil for a moment or two after the nuts are 
added. Serve very hot with cheese crackers. 

English Beef Soup, — Take the cracked joints of beef, and after put- 
ting the meat in the pot and covering it well with water let it come 
to a boil, when it should be well skimmed. Set the pot where the meat ' 
will simmer slowly until it is thoroughly done, keeping it closely cov- 
ered all the time. The next day, or when cold, remove the fat which 
hardens on the top of the soup. Peel, wash and slice three good-Sized 
potatoes and put them into the soup ; cut up half a head of white cab- 
bage in shreds and add to this a pint of Shaker corn that has been 
^oaked over night, two onions, one head of celery, and tomatoes, if de- 
sired. When these are done, and they should simmer slowly, care being 
taken that they do not burn, strain (or not, as preferred) the soup and 
serve. The different varieties of beef soup are formed by this method 
of seasoning and the different vegetables used in preparing it after the 
joints have been well boiled. Besides onions, celery, cabbage, tomatoes 
and potatoes, many use a few carrots, turnips, beets and force-meat balls, 
seasoned with spice. Rice or barley will give the soup consistency, and 
are to be preferred to flour for the purpose. Parsley, thyme and sage 
are the favorite herbs for seasoning, but should be used sparingly. To 
make force-meat balls add to one pound chopped beef one egg, a small 
lump of butter, a cup or less of bread crumbs ; season with salt and 
pepper and moisten with water from stewed meat; make in balls and

fry brown, or make egg-balls by boiling eggs, mashing the yolks with a 
silver spoon and mixing with one raw yolk and one teaspoonEul of flour; 
season with salt and pepper, make into balls ; drop in soup just before 
serving. 

Black Bean or Lentil Soup, — Soak a pint of black beans or lentils over 
night. In the morning, parboil ihem. Boil gently in fresh water until 
soft enough to rub through a sieve. Add a bay leaf, some cloves, and 
a stalk of celery. Brown two slices of bacon cut in dice with half a 
minced onion and turn into (he soup. Serve with squares of toast. 

Brown Flour Soup. — Put a lump of butter into a clean iron frying 
pan. When melted, sprinkle in half a cupful of flour and stir briskly 
until the flour is of a uniform brown color like roasted coffee. Add this 
gradually to two quarts of water. Peel and cut into cubes three pota- 
toes and cook in the soup 20 minutes. Season with an onion and a tea- 
spoonful of celery salt. 

Consomme. — Cut up two pounds of lean raw meat, beef or veal, and 
- add a cupful of cold roast beef, cut in pieces. Put over the fire with a 
cracked knuckle of veal, four quarts of cold water, two onions, one 
tariot, two stalks of celery, six peppercorns, a spoonful of salt, six 
cloves and a few herbs. Cook slowly all day. Strain, and vvhen cold 
skim off the fat. Add the white and shells of two eggs. Bring to a 
boil ai7d boil lO minutes. Strain through a cloth. 

Com Chowder,— Pare and slice thin onions enough to make a pint; 
boil one hour; to this add one-half pint potatoes cut small, boil 10 
minutes longer. Fry brown a shce of fat salt pork cut small and add 
fat and all, then a pint of tender sweet corn (canned corn is all right). 
Boil 10 minutes longer ; the whole of this now should be two quarts or 
more; this is the best time to salt and pepper to taste. Add one pint 
of milk and a cupful of cream or a piece of butter as large as an egg if 
cream is not plentiful. Do not let cream boil ; serve very hot. 

Cream of Corn Soup. — Scrape the corn from eight tender young 
ears. Boil the cobs in as little water as may be for 30 minutes. Strain 
oft the liquid, add the scraped corn and boil 20 minutes. Heal one quart 
of sweet milk to scalding point; rub together one tablespoonful butter 
and one teaspoonful flour; stir into the hot milk. Add one-half tea- 
spoonful salt, one-quarter teaspoonful while pepper. Pour over the corn, 
stir for a minute or' two, then pour into hot tureen. Serve with crou- 
tons. Croutons — Cut bread two days old into small triangles or dice. 
Brown in oven to a golden tint. They are very nice spread with a paste 
made of twice the quantity of butter creamed, of delicate cheese grated 
and a little finely chopped parsley. (Two teaspoons butter, one of grated 
cheese, one-fourth teaspoon chopped parsley). The i 
fried if desired. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. - 9 

Cream of Eggs.— Slice a medium-sized onion into a quart of milk 
and bring the milk to the scalding point in a double boiler. Strain 
out the onion and return the milk to the kettle with a teaspoonful of 
flour that has been rubbed fo a paste with the same quantity of butter. 
Stir to a smooth cream-like soup, and just before serving season with 
one teaspoonful of salt and three shakes of pepper. Chop coarsely, the 
white of four or five hard-boiled eggs and add to the soup. When 
ready to serve sprinkle each portion with the grated yolks. 

Cream of Salsify.— Take two buijches of salsify, wash, scrape and cut 
in small pieces and boil until tender. While hot mash and press through 
a colander. Have ready a cream made of two tablespoons of flour and 
two of butter melted together, seasoned with one-half saltspoonful white 
pepper and stirred into three cups milk and one cup water, which have 
previously been brought to a boil. Stir constantly until the consistency 
of a puree; add the prepared salsify, let boil up once, add three-quarters 
of a teaspoonful salt, and serve immediately. 

Fish Chowder, — Two pounds of fresh cod or any white fish, a quar- 
ter-pound bacon, four large potatoes, one small onion, half a can tomatoes, 
one quart milk, butter the size of a walnut, and a teaspoonful of flour 
for thickening. Pick the fish la pieces, removing all bone and skin; 
peel potatoes and cut into dice; cut the bacon in small piec.es; rub the 
butter and flour to a cream. On the bottom of a granite kettle spread 
half of the potatoes in a layer, then half of tish, then sprinkle in. the 
onions minced fine, then the bacon, then half the tomatoes. Then a 
shake of salt and pepper; add the rest of the fish, potatoes, tomatoes and 
more salt and pepper, using in all one teaspoonful salt and one-half tea- 
spoonful pepper. Cover with water, let simmer for half an hour. Let 
the milk come to a scald, put a pinch of soda into the chowder and stir; 
add the hot milk to the butter and flour; stir smooch; then add to the 
chowder; let get very hot, and serve. 

Milk Soup. — The various soups known as creams are usually about 
half milk and half meat or vegetable stock, slightly thickened with flour 
which has been blended with fat. For example, the tough, flabby portions 
and white leaves of a bunch of celery might be cut in small pieces, mixed 
with a sliced onion, covered with cold water and cooked until much of it 
can be rubbed throngh a strainer. To this juice and pulp is added an 
equal portion or even more of hot milk. For thickening a quart of soup 
slightly, one ounce of butter and one rounding tablespoonful of flour 
should be cooked together in a small saucepan until frothing, then add a 
little of the soup and beat until smooth, and then mix with the whole 
Season with salt and pepper. For a thicker soup use twice as much 
flour and butter, though the butter may be decreased slightly. However, 
if we use skim-milk for the soup, as we may, the increase of butter i

desirable. Such sotips can be made from almost any vegetable, varying 
the thickening according to the thickness of the pulp of the vegetables. 
Bean and pea soup require less flour, but a little will keep them from 
becoming watery on top. A corn chowder can be made much like a 
fish chowder from fresh or canned corn with pork fat, onion and po- 
tato. Such soups are excellent for supper on a cold night, and give an 
opportunity to turn skim-milk lo good account. 

Mock Oyster Soup. — Scrape a dozen roots of salsify, throwing at once 
into cold water to avoid discoloring^ cut into thin slices and cover with 
a quart of water, or preferably soup stock. Cook gently until perfectly 
tender (about an hour) ; then add a quart of milk, a teaspoonful of salt, 
one-fourth teaspoonful of pepper, and two tablespoon fuls of butter cut 
into bits. Serve with oyster crackers. 

Italian Onion Soup. — Boil six young but fully grown onions in two 
waters, turning off the first at the end of 10 minutes' boil, and replac- 
ing with fresh hot water. There should be a quart of the second water. 
When the onions are tender, add a cupful of dry, fine bread crumbs and 
cook gently for five minutes more. Pour the contents of the kettle into 
a colander and rub the onions and crumbs through it into the liquid in 
the bowl below. Return all to the fire, simmer for a minute and stir into 
the soup a."roux," made by heating to a bubbling cream a great spoon- 
ful of butter with one of flour in a frying pan. Have ready heated in 
another saucepan a cup of milk in which you have dropped a pinch of 
soda. Take the boiling soup from the fire, stir in the hot milk, and pour 
into a heated tureen. Pass Parmesan cheese with it. 

Cream of Oyster Soup.— Add to one quart of milk half of a small 
onion, two sprigs of parsley and a half a cupful of celery leaves and 
stalks. Scald in a double boiler. Mix one-fourth of a cupful of flour 
with sufficient cold milk to make a paste and add it to the scalded milk. 
Stir until it thickens and let cook for about SO minutes covered. Pour 
a cupful of cold water over a quart of oysters, strain the liquid through 
a cheesecloth and heat to a boiling point. Add the oysters and when the 
boiling point is reached add the thickened milk. Season with salt and 
white pepper and stir in, little by little, one-fourth of a cup of butter. 

Pink Velvet Soup.— Half a canful oi tomatoes, oue pint of water, 
one tablespoonful of butter, one large onion, chopped small ; one potato 
shaved thin, a saltspoonful of celery seed, a teaspoonful of salt, a table- 
spoonful of sugar and a pinch of sweet marjoram. Boil all together 
for half an hour, or until the potatoes melt. Strain, thicken with gran- 
ulated tapioca or cornstarch, boil five minutes, add a pinch of baking soda, 
and then pour in a pint of hot milk. Serve at once. 

Potato Soup. — Three potatoes, one pint milk, one teaspoonful chopped 
onions, one stalk celery, one teaspoonful salt, one teaspoonful celery salt. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 11 

one-half saltspoonful white pepper, one-fourth saltspoonful cayenne, one- 
half tablespoonful flour, one tablespoonful butter. Fare the potatoei 
and soak them in cold water one-half hour. Boil them until very soft. 
Cook onions and celery in milk in double boiler. When potatoes are 
soft drain and mash, add boiling milk and seasoning. Rub through 
strainer and put on to boil again. Melt butter in small saucepan; when 
bubbling add flour; when well mixed stir into boiling soup. Boil five 
minutes and serve very hot. This flour thickening prevents milk and 
potato from separating, and gives a smoothness quite unlike granular 
effects often noticed. If too thick add hot milk. The soup may also be 
made with meat stock instead of milk. 

Salmon Bisque.— One pint of oyster liquor and one of hot water 
heated together. When it boils stir in two eupfuls of finely minced 
salmon, seasoning with pepper, salt and a little chopped parsley. In an- 
other saucepan put one cupful of milk and heat to scalding, with a pinch 
of soda; stir into this two tablespoon fuls of butter, rubbed with one 
tablespoonful of flour and a half cupful of pounded cracker. Add one 
egg well beaten and stir and cook for a moment. Mix the flsh and 
milk mixtures, cook a few moments, pour into soup tureen and serve 
hot 

Scotch Broth. — One-half rup pearl barley, two pounds neck of mutton, 
two quarts cold water, one-fourth cup each of turnip, carrot, onion and 
celery chopped small, two tablespoons butter, one tablespoon flour, two 
teaspoonfuls salt, one saltspoon parsley chopped fine. Soak barley over 
night. Remove fat and skin from mutton, scrape meat from bones and 
cut in dice. Put bones on to boil in one pint cold water, the meat in 
separate pol with three pints water. Let the latter cook quickly. Skim 
when it begins to boil ; add barley ; skim again. Fry the chopped vege- 
tables in the hot butter five minutes, drain, add to the meat, simmer 
three hours. Strain the water in which the bones were simmered, set 
aside for a moment. Put in the saucepan the butter left from frying 
the vegetables, melt and add Ihe flour. When smooth, pour in gradually 
the liquid from the bones. Add to the broth, add salt, parsley and one- 
half saltspoon pepper, simmer 10 minutes and serve. As this broth is 
served without straining it is always well to boil bones separately. 

Split Pea Soup. — Wash a pint of split peas and cover with tepid 
water, adding a pinch of soda, and let remain over night to swell. In 
the morning put them in a kettle with three quarts of cold water, adding 
half a pound of lean salt pork cut into slices, also a teaspoonful of salt 
and a little pepper. Cook slowly for three hours, stirring occasionally 
till the peas are all dissolved, adding a little more boiling water to keep 
up the quantity as it boils away. Strain through a colander. Serve with 
small squares of toasted bread. 



12 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Squirrel Soup. — Allow one larKc or two small squirrels, well washed 
and jointed, to two quarts of cold water and two teaspoonfuls (level) 
of salt. Put to cook directly after breakfast in a stone pipkin or enam- 
eled kettle. Cover closely and set on the back of the range to simmer — 
not' boil. After two hours add the com from two ears, two small Irish 
potatoes, one-half cupful of Lima beans, three sprigs of parsley, three 
celery stalks and one-half cupful of sliced okra. Keep closely covered, 
and as the water evaporates add enough to keep the original two quarts. 
When the squirrels have cooked to rags strain through a coarse colander 
to remove the troublesome little bones. Return to the soup kettle, cover 
and continue to simmer until nearly time to serve. Then thicken with 
» dessertspoonful of butter rolled in a dessertspoonful of flour. Those 
who like may add a teaspoonful of powdered sassafras leaves. Have two 
slices of toast cut into inch squares, fried in butter and placed in the 
bottom of a hot tureen. Pour over them the soup, boiling hot, and 
serve immediately. 

Purie of Tomatoes. — Cook the contents of a can of tomatoes for 15 
minutes, then rub through a colander. Return to the fire and season with 
salt and pepper to taste, and a little sugar. Rub three tablespoonfuls of 
butter into one tablespoonful of cornstarch, and stir this smooth paste 
into the strained tomatoes. Cook, stirring steadily, until smooth and 
thick. Have ready heated in a saucepan a quart of rich milk into which 
has been stirred a pinch of baking soda. To this add, gradually, the 
thickened tomato liquor, beating the milk constantly as you do so. 
Serve immediately, putting a great spoonful of unsweetened whipped 
cream on the surface of each plate of soup. 

Vegetable Cream Soups. — Scald three cupfuls of milk. Rub together 
one tablespoonful of butter and two tablespoonfuls of flour, cook until 
it bubbles ; add (he hot milk gradually to this, and cook for five minutes, 
Stirring until thick and smooth. Blend some of this cream with a cup- 
ful of cooked vegetable, mashed to a smooth pulp, mix all together, and 
simmer for five minutes, seasoning appropriately. Potato soup should 
have a little celery and onion cooked in the milk, and when ready to 
serve some finely-chopped parsley should be scattered on top. Celery, 
asparagus, green peas or beans, carrots, spinach, cucumbers and lettuce 
are all good in such soup; all must first be cooked and reduced to a 
smootli pulp. Bread cut into dice and browned in butter is often added 
when the soup is ready to serve.

CHAPTER n. 

FISH. 

All small fish are best fried, and many large lish are excellent cooked 
in the same way. The fish should be well cleaned; if small left whole, 
if large cut into neat pieces. Beat an egg with a tablespoonful of cold 
water; dip the fish in this, then roll in bread crumbs or co^^meal. Cook 
in plenty of fat, which must be boiling hot when put in. Baking and 
bciling are both excellent methods of cooking fish, but very soft fish 
should never be boiled. The recipes given below refer mainly to canned 
and salt fish, because these are more helpful in an emergency. 

Qam Chowder.— Tate the liquor from fifty clams, put it on the stove 
to heat. Cut into dice Yt pound salt pork, brown it in the frying pan, 
and add to the clam liquor. Feel and cut into dice three quarts of ripe 
tomatoes and half the quantity of potatoes. Cut up 50 clams, and let all 
the ingredients boil slowly for two or three hours. Half hour before 
serving add half a dozen large crackers rolled tine. 

Clam Gumbo. — In one large tablespoonful of lard fry one finely- 
chopped onion, add one cupful of chopped cooked ham, one tablespoonful 
of chopped, green pepper, four tomatoes, skinned and cut in pieces, one 
pint of okra, stemmed and sliced, one scant teaspoonful of salt and one 
quart of water or broth. Simmer for an hour, add one dozen finely 
chopped clams, simmer 15 minutes, and serve. 

Clam Pie.— From a half pound of rather fat salt pork trim off the 
rind and cut in slices, then in dice. Slowly fry this, and when the fat 
is well drawn out and just beginning to color add half of a small onion 
cut fine. When golden brown add one quart of raw, diced potatoes, 
one pint of boiling water and one-quarter of a teaspoonful of black pep- 
per. Cover and cook slowly until the potatoes are almost tender. Take 
from the fire, add one solid pint of raw clams cut in quarters and their 
strained juice. Turn into a deep well-greased baking dish. While this 
mixture is cooking mix and sift together one pint and a half of flour, 
a .half teaspoonful of salt and two teaspoonfuls of baking powder. 
Mix to a soft dough with sweet milk, and roll out not over a half inch 
thick. Cut in small round biscuits. Place these close together over the 
top of the pie, brush with milk and bake in a hot oven for 35 minutes. 

Roast Gams, — Wash the clams and drain them in a colander for a 
few minutes, then lay them in a large dripping pan and put the pan into 
a verjr hot ovca Aa footi it tbc (belb b^o to open, the dam* tn

cooked; it takes from seven to 10 minutes to roast them. Have a cov- 
ered dish hot, and drop the clams into it as soon as they are taken from 
the shell. Spread over them a mustard cream sauce and serve at once. 
To make the sauce: Put one cup of milk over the fire in a double 
boiler. When boiling, gradualty stir into it three tablespoon fuls of but- 
ter, one of flour, and one teaspoonful of dry mustard that have been 
beaten to a creamy mass. Season with salt and pepper and return to the 
(ire; cook three minutes, and it is ready to serve. Thin slices of brown 
bread, buttered, are served with roast clams. 

Baked Fish. — Blnefisli, cod, or haddock are the best fish to bake. 
Clean the fish and make a stufiing as follows : Soak stale bread in cold 
water for 20 minutes. Press dry, and season with one egg, one table- 
spoonful melted butter and a small quantity of sage, or the prepared 
poultry dressing, or a little onion juice, as preferred. When the stuf- 
fing has been thoroughly mixed, fill tlie fish and sew up with needle and 
thread. Flour the fish well and salt tt. Lay a few thin slices of salt pork 
into the bottom of the baking dish, also a few slices on top of the 
fish. Baste it often with ths liquor which cooks out of it, adding a lit- 
tle water if there is not enough. Allow 15 minutes to the pound for 
baking fish. Have a moderate oven, as, if very hot, it will not cook 
well in the middle. 

New England Codfish.— Select a whole fish, and put it to soak in 
cold water over night; in the morning wash it clean and cut off the fins 
and tail. Cook the fish whole; if you have not got a fish kettle place it 
in a large milk pan partly filled with water. Cover the pan closely and 
set over a kettle of hot water. It will cook very slowly in this way, say 
five or six hours, according to the size of the fish, but it will be done 
properly when ready for the table. Serve it whole, placing it, on a hot 
platter. Indeed, one of the essentials of a good salt fish dinner is to 
have everything hot, not only the fish and vegetables, but plates and 
dishes as well. The dish on which your fish is served must be an ample 
one, and around the fish you will place a garnish of nicely sliced beets 
and carrots. With the fish you will serve pork scraps and egg sauce 
and boiled potatoes. The pork should be cut into dice and fried a rich 
brown. To make the egg sauce, take two eggs that have been boiled 
10 minutes, remove the shell, and cut into little pieces, placing them in 
the sauce dish. Blend a piece of butter the size of an egg with a table- 
spoonful of flour, and when the fish is ready to serve, pour over a coffee- 
cupful of boiling water, stir, and pour into the sauce dish with the egg 
and stir again. If the sauce is too thick, add still more boiling water. 
When you have not time to cook a salt fish for dinner and desire an 
emergency dish, try salt fish in cream prepared as follows : Shred a 
cupful of salt cod, or, if yon prefer, use the prepared article, place it in 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. « 

a stewpan over the lire in cold water to cover, and let it come to a boil 
for a couple of minutes ; pour off the water, add to the fish one pint 
of sweet milk, and when this boils thicken with flour wet with milk; 
let it boil four or five minutes, being careful it does not scorch, and 
serve in a hot, deep dish. Serve pickled beets with this dish, and boiled 
potatoes. 

Cuban Codfish. — Pick into fine shreds a cupful of freshened codfish. 
Cut an onion into thin slices and lightly brown in a saucepan with a 
tablespoonful of butter. Add the fish and pour in just enough water 
to cover. Add a part of a chopped green pepper and a half can of to- 
matoes. Cover closely and simmer for an hour. If the tomatoes are 
very juicy, less water is required. Cream a rounded teaspoonful of but- 
ter and one of flour; stir into the fish until smooth and cooked; turn the 
mixture upon thin slices of buttered toast. 

Delicate Fishballs. — Boil the quantity of codfish that would be re- 
quired, changing the water once that it may not be too salt. While the 
fish is hot pick it very fine, so that it will be feathery. It cannot be done 
fine enough with a fork, and should be picked by hand. At the same 
time have hot boiled potatoes ready, mash them thoroughly and make 
them creamy with milk and a good-sized lump of butter. To three cup- 
fuls of mashed potatoes take I'/i cupful of fish; the fish should not be 
packed down. Beat one egg lightly and stir into the other ingredients 
and season to taste. Beat the mixture well together and until light, then 
mold it into small balls, handling lightly and before frying roll the balls 
in flour. Fry them in smoking hot fat until a gold color, 

Mexican Codfish. — Fry to a pale yellow one small onion, chopped 
fine, in three tablespoonfuls of butter; add two tablespoon fu Is of flour, 
half 3 green pepper, chopped fine, and one cupful of stewed and sifted 
tomato pulp. When the sauce reaches the boiling point, add half a 
pound of salt codfish, which has been freshened for Zi hours in cold 
water and slowly simmered until it will readily separate into flakes. 

Codfish Mound. — Make one quart of good mashed potatoes without 
any salt; add a pint of picked boiled codfish. Season with pepper; beat 
well together, make into a mound with a depression in center on a bak- 
isb dish, and set in the oven to brown. When brought to the table, pour 
a few tablespoonfuls of cream sauce in center of mound, and garnish 
with hard-boiled egg. Serve with boiled beets and, if desired, salt pork 
or bacon cut into tiny squares and fried crisp, which, with the fat fried 
out, is poured into a gravy bowl. This makes a hearty and satisfying 

Biscay Salt Cod. — Bone two pounds of salt cod and soak in cold 
water for 12 hours. Place in a saucepan, cover with salt water and let 
heat gradually to boilmg point; then add fresh water and let boil again. 



18 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Take out and drain. Chop two onions and one green pepper quite fine 
;ind cook for five minutes in butter or oil. Add one sliced tomato or 
half-cupfui of stewed tomatoes, one clove of garlic and a small chili 
pepper. Add to these three pints of broth, a small bunch oi parsley, 
three tablespoonfuls of tomato catsup and a pint of small potatoes 
(peeled) or the same quantity of potato balls. Cook until the potatoes 
are just done, add the cod ai;d cook five minutes longer. 

Salt Codfish Chowder. — Cut one-fourth pound of salt pork into bits 
and Iry out the fat in a frying pan ; in this brown two medium-sized 
onions, sliced. Wash and drain a pound of codfish, cut or picked into 
bits; cover with cold water and set on back of range to heat, but not 
boil. ■ After two hours add a pint and a half of potatoes pared and sliced, 
and a dash of pepper. Add a cupful of water to the onions and pork 
and strain over the potatoes. When the potatoes are tender add one 
cupful each of scalded cream and milk. Pour the chowder over six 
crackers broken into halves and serve. 

Finnan Haddie, Caledonian Style.— Soak one-half of a finnan haddie 
weighing four pounds, two hours in milk and water to cover, using 
eqaal parts, having the liquid at a uniformly even tepid temperature. 
This is best accomplished by having the fish in a drip pan on the back 
of the range. Trim the fish to fit a copper platter or graniteware drip- 
ping pan, by cutting off fiank and a two-inch piece from the tail end. 
Pour over a cream sauce, and surround with six halves of potatoes of 
uniform size smoothly pared. Cook until the potatoes are soft, the time 
required being about 40 minutes, basting with the cream sauce three 
times during the cooking. Cream must enter into the composition of a 
real cream sauce. For the cream sauce for the finnan haddie, melt two 
tablespoonfuls of butter, add two tablespoonfuls of fiour, and stir until 
well blended, then pour en gradually, while stirring constantly, one cupful 
of milk and one-half cupful of cream. Bring to the boiling point, and 
season with a few grains of pepper. No salt will be needed, for it must 
be remenibeied that finnan haddie is salted. 

Finnan Haddie in Cream. — Cover a pound of the fish with cold water 
and let come to a simmer, drain, then cut into moderate-sized pieces. In 
the meantime prepare a cream sauce made by melting a tablespoonful 
of butter to which is added a tablespoonful of flour, a scant saltspoontul 
of salt, a dash of cayenne, two teaspoonfuls of lemon juice and one-half 
cupful each of milk and cream. Add the pieces of fish, lei the whole 
come to a boil and serve. _This creamed fish is also very nice if put 
in a baking dish, covered with bread crumbs, and browned in the oven. 
Browned Salt Mackerel. — Freshen two fish by soaking over night, 
wash in fresh water in the morning and squeeze over the flesh side the 
juice of one-half a lemon. Lay one of the fish skin side down in baking 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 17 

dish and cover with dressing made of one cupful bread crumbs, one table- 
spoonful butter (scant), pinch of pepper, a little grated lemon peel and 
one-fourth cupful of cream. Lay the other fish on dressing, skin side up, 
and baste well with hot water and melted butter. Put into a hot ov(*i 
for 20 minutes, then cover with bread crumbs, dot with bits of butter 
and put back in the oven till nicely browned. Carefully dish without 
disturbing the layers and serve with thin lemon slices and parsley as a 
garnish. 

Oyster Chowder. — Fry together two ounces of salt pork and one 
onion, sliced. Parboil one pint of sliced potatoes five minutes and drain. 
Look over carefully one pint of oyslers, pour over one-half cupful of 
water and heat to the boiling point; skim out the oysters and pour the 
liquor over the potatoes, add the pork and onions and cook the potatoes 
until tender, adding a little more water if necessary; add the oysters, 
one pint of milk and one-half cupful of fine bread crumbs. Season with 
one teaspoonful of salt and half-teaspoonful of pepper and pour in the 
serving dish. 

Oyster Stew. — Put one quart of oysters in a colander, and pour over 
three-fourths of a cupful of cold water, reserving the liquor. Pick qmm- 
the oysters, being careful that no particles of shells adhere to the tough 
muscles. Heat the reserved liquor to the boiling point, strain through a 
double thickness of cheese cloth, add the oysters, and cook, stirring oc- 
casionally, until the oysters are plump and the edges begin to curl. Re- 
move the oyslers with a skimmer to a heated tureen, and add one-fourth 
of a cupful of butter, one-half tablespoonful of salt, one-eighth of a 
teaspoonful of pepper, the oyster liquor, strained a second time through 
a double thickness of cheese cloth, and four cupfuls of scalded milk. 

Baked Pickerel. — Clean the fish carefully and lay on a rack in a 
dripping pan; dredge with a teaspoonful of salt, several dashes of pepper, 
and a little flour. Bake carefully, basting every 10 minutes until well 
done, with hot water to which a tablespoonful of butler has been added. 
Make the sauce with half a cup of cream and half a cup of the basting 
liquid in which the fish was cooked ; thicken with a teaspoonful of butter 
and a tablespoonful of flour; let the sauce boil up once, then add a ta- 
blespoonful of chopped parsley. Pour part of the sauce around the 
fish on a platter, and serve the remainder in a gravy boat. 

Quahaug Pie. — Remove the loose brown skin and black part from a 
quart of sea clams and chop the remainder fine. Scald a cup of milk, 
the liquid from the clams and enough water, to make a pint in all, and 
thicken it with a tablespoonful each of flour and butter cooked to a 
smooth paste; then add pepper and salt to taste and two finely-chopped 
hard-boiled eggs, and lastly, the chopped clams. Line a meat pie dish 
with pie crust, then add a thin layer of cracker crumbs, the prepared 



la THB RURAL COOK BOOK. 

clams, and sprinkle this over with another I^er of cracker crumbs and 
cover with a good, rich crust, leaving several openii^ so the steam 
can escape. Bake about an hour in a hot oven until well browned. 

Salmon Chowder. — Chop coarsely and brown together in a kettle or 
saucepan, one-fourth pound of salt pork and one onioa Add oof pint 
of raw potatoes, chopped or cut in dice, which have stood for half an 
hour in cold water. Season, barely cover with boiling water, and sim- 
mer for hiilf an hour; then add a can of salmon, drained and flaked, 
two or three broken crackers and one pint of scalded milk or cream, 
with two teaspoons of butter. This may be varied by the addition of a 
can of tomatoes, or a shredded pepper or both. 

Creamed Salmon. — Put one tablespoonful of butter into a saucepan; 
when melted add- ore tablespoonful of flour, half a teaspoonful of salt, 
a dash of paprika and half a cup of milk. Cook until smooth, then add 
a small can of salmon finely minced, one tablespoonful lemon juice and 
a little grated nutmeg. Remove from the fire and add yolks of three 
eggs, well beaten; whip whites of the eggs stiff and fold in carefully. 
Butter small molds or a baking dish, place in hot water in a dripping 
paiMuid bake from 10 to 2S minutes. 

Escalloped Salmon, — Put one pint of milk to heat with a tablespoon- 
ful of butter. Moisten a tablespoonful of flour and stir in; when thick 
like cream remove from fire. Drain the liquid from the salmon and 
remove bone, pick it all up into flne pieces with a fork. Butter a bak- 
ish dish, put in a layer of fine cracker crumbs, then half the salmon, an- 
other layer of cracker crumbs, and half the thickened milk. Then add 
the remaining salmon, a layer of crumbs and the remaining milk. Bake 
half an hour. 

Salmon Loaf. — One can of salmon drained and minced. Five table- 
spoonfuls of butter, four eggs well beaten; half cup of bread crumbs, 
salt and pepper to taste. Mix all- together, and steam one hour in but- 
tered mold. 

Fried Smelts, — Do not have the heads removed when the marketman 
cleans the fish. Wipe the outside of each with a damp cloth and then 
roll in Indian meal, then in beaten egg and then again into the meal; lay 
in a frying basket or place a few in a kettle of hot lard to cook until 
the coating is brown; remove them and drain on to plain paper, and when 
serving arrange with garnishing of sliced lemon and parsley. If the 
basket is used place the fish side by side in it and drop into the kettle of 
hot lard until the fish are browned. 

Sportsman's Trout. — Take two fresh young trout, clean, wash and 
then wipe dry. Use one-half teaspoon of salt and two or three dashes 
of pepper over the fishes. Put in a pan to fit and fill to the level with 
cream. Bake a light brown, when the fish will have absorbed the cream.

And how the housewife's goodly fare doth disappear from sight. 

I am the dinner table, and while my timbers stand 

I'll Btlll remain beodqnartera for our good houiebold band. 

Elaborate instructions for marketing are usually given under this head, 
but the farm housekeeper meets with different cooditions. If meat is 
locally slaughtered it is likely to be much better in quality than that from 
the great packing centers. In pork particularly she has a great advantage 
over her town sisters. It should be remembered that in beef and mutton 
many of the cheaper and tougher cuts arc nutritious and well flavored, 
but they need careful preparation, and especially long slow cookit^. 
Tough meat should never be roasted, broiled or fried ; it should be cooked 
gently in a closed vessel, with such seasonings as will best develop flavor. 
There are still some cooks who prepare meat hastily in slightly thickened 
water, and then wonder why the family dislikes stews. With long, slow 
cooking in a casserole or closed vessel, and a proper admixture of herbs 
and seasoning, the humble stew becomes a delicious ragout. 

Bacon, Cold Roast. — Select a square piece weighing three or four 
pounds, soak it over night. The next morning put it on to boil, allowing 
it to simmer very gently three-quarters of an hour to the pound; then 
let it go cool in the water in which it was cooked. When cold drain, 
remove the skin, rub the fat well with sugar, pour over it some cider 
vinegar, and roast in the oven until brown. When cold cut into thin 
slices ; it should be tender and delicate in flavor. 

Beef, Braised. — Procure a piece of four pounds, make incisions in it 
an inch and a half apart, and stuff them with a dressing made of two 
tablespoonfuls of linely-minced onion, three tablespoonfuls of chopped 
parsley, a teaspoonful of sweet basil, a half teaspoonful of thyme, a half 
leaspoonful of pepper and two teaspoonfuls of salt Dredge a table- 
spoonful of flour over the meat, lay three thin slices of bacon in the 
bottom of a deep pan, place the meat in, lay three more slices of bacon 
over the top, cover with a well-fitting lid and shut up in a moderate oven 
to brown. After it has been cooking for two hours add two carrots (or 
four small ones), one turnip, three stalks of celery, four salsifies and one 



30 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

onion, all sliced. Add also three tablespoon fuls of tomato catsup, one 
minced green pepper, a teaspoonful of salt If no green pepper is at 
hand use a few shreds of red pepper pod. A coffeecupful of boiling water 
should be added with the vegetables. Fit the cover on closely again and 
leave in the oven for another hour, or until both meat and vegetables are 
tender. To serve, place the meat on a hot platter and arrange the vege- 
tables by the spoonful about it; there should be just gravy enough to 
hold the vegetables together. 

Beef, Corned. — Here is an old home recipe for corning beef, which 
will be especially useful to tliose who kill their own beef cattle as well 
as pork. To every hundred pounds of beef take nine pounds of salt, four 
pounds of sugar or two quarts of good molasses, two ounces of soda, one 
ounce of saltpeter, and just enough water to cover the meat — about four 
or five galloas. Strew some salt over the bottom of a barrel ; mix about 
half the amount of salt given with half the given amount of sugar or 
molasses, and rub each piece of meat thoroughly with it before placing it 
in the barrel. Dissolve the saltpeter and soda together in hot water, add 
the remainder of the salt and sugar and about four or five gallons of 
cold water. Pour this over the meat. Place a board on top of the meat, 
with a weight heavy enough to keep it under the. brine. It may be kept 
an indefinite time in the brine, but is salt enough to cook after five or 
six days' corning. 

Spiced corned beef is made as follows, the recipe being an old one, 
we think of German origin : Rub twelve pounds of a round of beef with 
half a pound of coarse sugar. Let it stand for two days, turning it two 
or three times. Take a large teaspoonful of mace, a teaspoonful of black 
pepper, two of cloves, half a teaspoonful of cayenne, one small grated 
nutmeg, two ounces of juniper berries and one-half ounce of saltpeter. 
Stir all these seasonings together, adding a teaspoonful of sugar and rub 
the mixture thoroughly into the meat and all over it. Then let it stand 
for three days longer. At the end of this time rub half a pound of fine 
salt into the meat. Finally, let it stand for twelve days, rubbing the meat 
and turning it daily. If it is to be cooked immediately and not dried, wash 
it, but do not soak it. Lay it in a pot that just fits it, and pour over it a 
quart and a half of waler. When it comes to the boiling point skim it 
carefully, add a carrot, a small onion, a bay leaf and a tew sprigs of par- 
sley. Let it simmer very gently for four and a half hours. Take it from 
the fire, put it under a heavy weight and let it cool in the liquid in which 
it was cooked. Serve in thin slices when perfectly cold. 

Corned Beef, Shaker Style. — This recipe is given under the name of 
"bacca," in Good Housekeeping ; Pound down close in a barrel 100 
. pounds of the roimd of beef cut in 10-pound pieces, with a mixture of 
four pounds sugar, two ounces saltpeter, two ounces soda bicarbonate, aad 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 11 

four quarts table salt sprinkled under, over and between. It will make 
brine without water. After one week, a piece of the top of the round, 
sliced and broiled, will be found tender and delicious. The bottom of 
the round, boiled till tender and sliced, thin when cold, resembles ham, 
but is more choice in flavor. 

Corned Beef, Savory Style,— Choose a piece of brisket of corned beef 
weighing four to five pounds and about three times as long as wide; 
wash, season with a small haif teaspoonfiil of pepper, then roll it up and 
tie very tight Put the beef in a kettle with cold water to cover, and 
Id slowly come to a boil, then pour it off and replace with more cold 
water to cover; add half a cupful of vinegar, a small onion, peeled, in 
which is inserted six cloves, half a red pepper, a blade of mace and a 
stalk of celery. Boil gently, allow half an hour to each pound. Serve hot. 
If the meat is preferred cold, it should be allowed to cool in the broth 
in which it was cooked. 

Curried Beef.— Melt in a saucepan two tablespoonfuls of butter, add 
two onions sliced, and fry until brown; then add two tablespoonfuls of 
curry powder. Cut cold roast beef in pieces about an inch square, put it 
in the saucepan and add half a cupful of sweet milk. Simmer for 30 
minutes. Just before serving add the juice of a lemon. Send to the 
table on a platter bordered with boiled rice. 

Beef Loaf.— Take two pounds of round steak and half a pound of 
suet, both chopped fine ; add two eggs, one cupful of bread crumbs that 
have been softened in cold water, one small onion, chopped fine, one-half 
cupful of sweet milk V/i teaspoonful of salt, and a fourth of a tea- 
spoonful of pepper ; mix all together and shape into a loaf, put in a roast- 
ing pan and bake in a moderate oven 2}/i hours, baste frequently ; serve 

Beefsteak Chowder. — Cut a pound and one-half of round steak in strips 
or cubes. Cut three or four ounces of fat pork in small pieces and cook 
in a hot frying pan with an onion sliced very thin. When both are 
browned add a quart of boiling water, simmer five minutes, pour the 
whole over the Steak, bring lo the boiling point, boil for five minutes and 
then cook slowly until the meat is tender. Have ready five large potatoes 
peeled, sliced, scalded in boiling water, drained and rinsed in cold water. 
Add the potatoes, one teaspoonful of salt and saltspoonful of pepper. 
Cook until the potatoes are tender, then add one and one-half cupful of 
rich milk and a little more salt if necessary. Heat to the boiling point 
and pour over pilot biscuit or thick crackers which have been dipped for 
a second in hot water, 

English Beefsteak Pudding, — Make a crust by thoroughly mixing two 
cupfuls of finely-chopped beef suet in three cupfuls of flour; add half 
teaspoonful of salt, and mix with cold water into a dough with the con- 



22 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

tislency of biscuit. Roll out the paste to the thickness of half an inch. 
Butter an earthen pudding bowl, and line with the paste. Take flank or 
round steak, cut into one-inch pieces, season with pepper and salt, and 
fill the dish. Pour in as much cold water as will find its way in around 
the meat, then cover it with paste, having moistened the edges to make 
them stick together. Cover with a cloth, well floured, leaving a little 
room for the pudding to swell. Put it into a pot of boiling water, and 
let it boil three hours, or put it in a steamer, and allow four hours' 
cooking. When fully cooked the meat should be very tender, with an 
abundance of rich clotted gravy. The addition of a few oysters with 
the meat forms a palatable change. Serve with boiled carrots and turnips. 

Spiced Beef, — This makes a desirable cold dish for luncheon or tea, 
or for Sunday dinner in Summer. Select a piece of the flank, trim aS 
the coarse skin, lay it flat on the table, and, with a knife, spread over it 
the following mixture; One leaspoonful ground mustard, one teaspoonful 
celery salt, half teaspoonful black pepper, pinch of red pepper, mixed to 
a smooth paste with vinegar. Then roll up the meat like a jelly cake, the 
spice inside, tie it up, tie it in a cloth like a pudding. Put it into boiling 
water, and let it boil a^ hours. When cooked lift the kettle off the 
stove, and allow the water to cool before removing the :peat. Do not 
lake the cloth off until cold, then slice the meat for serving. 

Waverly Collared Beef. — Com a six -pound piece of the thick part of 
the brisket by putting it in brine strong enough to float an egg, to which 
is added a heaping teaspoonful of saltpeter, one of brown sugar and a 
saltspoon of red pepper. Leave it in five or six days in Summer ; eight 
or 10 in Winter. Us£ an earthen crock, and turn the meat every two or 
three days. Grate two large carrots, a good-sized stick of horseradish, 
and chop flne a large bunch of parsley; mix all together, and spread a 
thick layer on the corned beef, keeping it well to the middle, as it presses 
out when you roll; if the meat is not long, and difficult to roll nicely, cut 
a few pockets in it and till with the dressing; then roll very tightly, 
fastening with skewers and binding with strong string round and round. 
Any of the dressing that has squeezed out press back into the open ends 
of the roll ; remove the skewers ; then lie up in cheesecloth, cover with 
cold water, bring slowly to a simmer, and let it cook at this point four 
hours. Remove the cheesecloth, put the meat on a tray, place a heavy 
weight on it and leave it over night. Cut off the string. Serve cold, 
cutting thin slices off the end, showing the dressing. 

BroR'n Stew, — A piece of tough steak can be very well cooked in this 
way: Brown a tablespoonful of sugar in the kettle and add a sliced 
onion; when brown cool and add for each pound of beef cut in small bits 
1 tablespoonful of flour and one of blotter or suet. Add a pint of boiling 
water, stir well and add the bits of meat. Put in half of a bay leaf or a 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. tt 

pinch of celery seed. Cook very slowly for an hour. Just before serving 
add a teaspoonful of salt. The meat will be tender, the flavor excellent 
The browned sugar, or caramel, as cooks call it, does not give a percep- 
tibly sweet flavor, but gives ?. different taste, and makes .brown gravy. 

Brunswick Stew. — Stew a large fowl until the meat leaves the bone; 
remove skin, gristle and bones and chop the meat in coarse pieces. Return 
to the liquor; add a pint of corn scraped from the ears, a pint of young 
Lima beans, three cupfuls of tomato, a good-sized onion, minced fine, a 
pint of young okras, a small red pepper, minced, a little celery seed, two 
tablespoonfuls of butter and salt, pepper and Worcestershire sauce to 
taste. Simmer until okra is tender and then serve. The addition of :i 
little paprika just before the stew is taken up improves it greatly. 

Belgian Hare. — If you broil see that the hares are young, under four 
or five months, and therefore tender. After a brief soaking in water into 
which no soda or salt has been put (if the hares are young they have 
no unpalatable flavor and consequently great care must be taken to pre- 
serve their natural delicacy), dry well with a clean cloth, and gash them 
down the back through the thickest porlion; then flatten each, place it 
on a gridiron, and broil it over a bed of coals, turning often, or you may 
lay them smooth on the bottom of a dripping pan and cook in a hot 
oven without basting; oil the pan slightly with a little sweet dripping, 
or a bit of fresh butter; they should be done in half an hour. 

Stewed. — Cut the hares into joints, drop into a pot and cover with 
boilii^ water; then slice in an onion and a bit of bacon, and stew slowly 
one hour or until tender. As old hares are best stewed, it will do no 
harm to put in a young chicken, stewing all together. At the end of 
half an hour add a few potatoes, peeled, and (nit in quarters, and, if liked, 
some small bits of light paste, after the potatoes get fairly boiling. When 
all are done, stir in a little cream thickened with white flour, boil up a 
moment and dish for the table. 

Fried. — Disjoint, cut uniform pieces, cover with boiling water, and 
let it simmer until quite tender. Then remove carefully to a dry dish. 
Dredge well with flour, and drop into very hot butter to browa Serve 
with gravy made from the Hquor in which it was boiled and cream. Two 
tablespoonfuls of vinegar added while boiling are an improvement. 

Roast Hare. — Make a dressing of fine dry bread crumbs; part graham 
is best. Add to the crumbs a small lump of fresh butter, a little dry 
sage (or other herb, if preferred), and moisten well with tepid water, 
stirring well as you add it. Do not put in too much water; have the 
dressing light and flaky, not wet and heavy. The large and delicious 
liver of the hare, having been thoroughly steamed will add an unwonted 
zest if chopped into bits and put into the stuffing. Fill the hares with 
this, leaving plenty of room for the dressing to swell, sew up, put the 



E4 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

harea into a dripping pan, add a cupful of boiling water, and roast u 
slowly as possible during the first half hour. Baste every 15 or 20 min- 
utes, turning as needed, and if any part browns too fast, cover it with a 
clean napkin- wet in warm water and folded two or three times. Allow 
from one to two hours for roasting; test with a fork to ascertain when 
the hares are done; take them out of the pan and make the gravy, drain 
the grease all off and set the pan an the stove ; then put in any tid-bits 
(as the liver, etc.), and the liquor in which they are boiled; thicken with 
a little browned flour wet with milk or water, and boil up a moment. 

Canning Meat. — Half cook the meat in a kettle, cut meat from the 
bones. If this is done while the meat is hot, wring out a cloth from' 
cold or tepid water, fold in several thicknesses, and set under the (lass 
can, letting cloth come up about an inch around sides of can, and it will 
not break, no matter how hot the meat may be. If you spill more broth 
on the cloth be sure to wring out extra water from it, for if the cloth 
is sopping wet, the can will break. Having filled can with meat, pour in 
all the broth the can will hold, and see that it is salted and peppered 
just right for the table. Screw on cover without rubber and, if hot put in 
kettle partly filled with hot water, putting a tin in bottom of kettle to 
set cans on. Three quarts can be put in common-sized kettle. Cover 
with a weil-fittirg cover that will keep in the steam, and keep boiling for 
two hours. Take out one can al a time, and at once put on a good rubber. 
If you want to keep the meat for several months, if it is chicken, veal or 
beef, have hot melted beef suet and fill the cans even full. If you only 
care to keep the meat for two or three weeks fill up even full with boiling 
broth. This work must be done with dispatch, not letting the contents 
of the can cool in the least. Screw on the cover to the last limit, tntl 
if your covers and rubbers are not defective your meat will keep per- 
fectly. In canning pork there Is nearly always sufficient grease to broth; 
if not the can may be filled with lard. 

Canning Meat in Tins. — Trim off all surplus tallow from meat, and 
either boil or roast the beef, using but little salt and pepper, preferably 
none al all, as these will attack the tin ; meat can be spiced, etc., when 
removed from can to serve. When cooked remove from liquid and trim 
off from bones. If liquid is too greasy let it get cold and then remove 
tallow. While again heating liquid and meat boiling hot get the cans and 
covers ready, the covers to be pierced by an awl in the center. Use the 
friction top tin can only, for keeping meat through the Summer and dog 
days. You can use glass jars to keep same till May, but they are risky 
during warm weather. When meat and liquid are hot pack meat into the 
cans — any size you wish — not quite full, and pour liquid over same lo as 
to cover meat somewhat, then place on the covers good and tight. Put 
cans into oven and bake one to two hours. If cans are too full, liquid

will ooze through vent. The baking will drive out every particle or atom 
of air through vent, and is absolutely necessary iot safety. When nearly 
done baking liquefy some paraffin or sealing wax, and heat a soldering 
iron. The pa.raffin is to seal cover airtight around edge, and the soldering 
iron to use with solder to close up vent opening in center. Take out of 
oven a can at a time and solder vent opening as quickly as possible, then 
paraffin the edge of cover. Place Cans — after finishing job — where it is 
<\ry and cool. A steer can be packed into about 50 or 60 quart cans. 

Chicken Baked in Milk, — Dress and joint a chicken of four to six 
pounds, dust each piece with salt and pepper, and roll in flour. Put the 
chicken in a roasting pan or casserole that it will half fill, then pour over 
it enough sweet milk to cover the chicken completely. Put a close-fitting 
iid on the baker, and put it in the oven, cooking the chicken until tender; 
it will take from two to VA hours. This requires but little attention while 
cooking, the meat is tender and juicy, and the gravy delicious. It is an 
excellent way to cook an elderly fowl ; a young bird will, of course, cook 
in a shorter time. As it really gains in flavor by being warmed over, it 
can be cooked on Saturday for the Sunday dinner, thus lessening work. 

Broiled Chicken.— Take broilers of suitable age or size, dress in the 
usual way, split down the back and remove breast bone, which can be 
easily done by running finger along it. Place right side up in dripping 
pan, season with plenty of butter, pepper and salt ; put in a hot oven 
for 20 minutes to "draw" or beat well through. Take out; if cooking 
with gas turn, and put under flame a few minutes to brown ; then brown 
the lop, but do not burn. If cooking on stove with fuel proceed the same 
way on toaster or gridiron. 

Broiled Chicken, O. W. Mapes's Recipe,— The first essential of course 
is to have a nice fat chicken. This should be split through the back and 
laid in a shallow basin. Now place the basin containing the chicken in a 
steamer and steam for an hour and a half. The basin will catch all the 
juices which drip from the meat. These should all be saved and used in 
making the gravy. As soon as it is steamed sufficiently place in a well- 
buttered pan and fry until well browned ; remove the meat and add the 
juices from steaming to make a good gravy. This method never has 
failed to bring satisfaction to both cook and guests. Possibly it would 
be equally as good with older birds by allowing more time in the steaming. 
Spring Chicken Fried in Cream, — Put a pint of rich cream in a frying 
pan over a moderate tire till it begins to color, dip the different parts of 
the chicken in fiour, fry in the cream on each side till it is a delicate brown. 
When done put it on a hot platter, pour another half pint of cream into 
the pan, let it boil one minute, add a saltspoonful of salt, a dash of 
pepper, then pour it over the chicken. Serve garnished with sprigs of 
parsley and a dish of puffed potato slices. 



26 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Jugged Chicken. — Cut the bird up as for a fricassee. To every pound 
allow two heaping teaspoonfuls of flour, one scant teaspoonful of salt 
and one-Quarter (eAspoonful of pepper; mix thoroughly and roll each 
piece of chicken in the mixture, then pack closely in a large bean-pot; 
cover with boiling water and bake in a good oven until tender— from two 
to three hours. When placed in the pot sprinkle in a tablespoonful of 
minced onion. When done remove to a hot platter, thicken the liquor 
for gravy and serve in a boat. 

Chicken Loaf, — Mince fine two cupfuls of cold cooked chicken, one 
pound of lean veal and one-fourth pound of fat salt pork. Work in these 
three beaten e^s, a cupful of seasoned and strained tomato sauce, one 
teaspoonful of grated lemon peel, one teaspoonful of salt, one-fourth 
teaspoonful of paprika and enough cracker crumbs to mold with the hands. 
Press firmly into a large wet bowl, invert carefully into a buttered baking 
pan, removing bowl. Add one cupful of water and one tablespoonful of 
butter to the pan. Sift buttered crumbs lightly over the loaf and cover 
the top and sides with carefully peeled and sliced lemons. Bake 1J4 
hour in a moderate oven, browning it nicely before serving. Baste fre- 
quently with the liquor. Serve garnished with lemon slices and parsley. 

Paprika Chicken. — This is a favorite Hungarian dish. Cut a nice 
tender chicken into pieces as for a fricassee; flatten a little, such pieces 
as need it. Season each piece with salt and pepper, and dredge it lightly 
with flour, while you fry a minced onion in two tablespoon fuls of butter. 
Lay the chicken in the butter and onion, cooking for 20 minutes, so it will 
be evenly and thoroughly done. Take up the chicken and stir in an even 
teaspoonful of salt and a very scant teaspoonful of paprika, or half a 
scant teaspoonful of good mild cayenne pepper of any kind. Add last 
of all a cupful of rich cream. Make some dumplings of a pint of sifted 
flour, two teaspoonfuls of baking powder, a saltspoonful of salt and 
butter the size of half an egg; moisten the dumplings with a cupful of 
milk, and drop them over the sauce. Let them cook well, covered for 
50 minutes, when they will be well puffed up and light. Pour the sauce 
around the chicken and make a circle of the dumplings. If the dumplings 
arc steamed over the cream sauce so they do not sink into it they will 
be lighter. 

Panned Fowl with Oysters. — Cut the fowl into pieces suitable for 
serving; lay them in a baking dish, flesh side down; season with a tea- 
spoonful of salt, a fourth of a teaspoonful of pepper and cover with thin 
slices of salt pork. Put one cupful of boiling water in the pan, cover 
closely and bake in a hot oven half an hour (for young chickens). Remove 
the cover, and baste every 10 minutes for another half hour, turning the 
pieces so they will brown. Remove to a hot platter, add half a cupful of 
rich milk or cream to the gravy in the pan, first skimming off all fat; 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 37 

place on the top of the range and stir in a tablespoonful of flour and sane 
of butler blended together; when it boils add a cupful of well-washed 
(and cleaned from shells) oysters; watch carefully and as soon as the 
oysters are plump remove them from the fire; add a teaspoonful of 
finely-chopped parsley and a tablespoon ful of lemon juice. Pour around 
the fowl ; garnish with celery tips. An old fowl will require longer 
cooking. 

Chicken Pie, Southern Style- — Select a fowl weighing four or five 
pounds; clean carefully, singe and put it on in boiling water enough to 
cover it, and let it simmer gently until it begins to grow tender. Save 
this broth with the giblets. Now cut the chicken in small pieces; slice a 
quarter of a pound of fat pork very thin and try it with the chicken 
until it' is brown. After the chicken and pork are fried take them up 
and stir into the pan in which they were cooked a tablespoonful of flour. 
Stir it over the fire until brown ; then add a pint of the chicken broth, a 
teaspoonful of salt, quarter of a teaspoonful of pepper. Stir this gravy 
until it has boiled two minutes and use it for pie. To make the crust; 
Mix together in a bowl with a knife one pound of flour, one teaspoonful 
of salt, two teaspoonfuls of butter, and just enough cold water to hold 
it together. Roll it out abotit an inch thick ; cut a quarter of a pound 
of butter in large slices, and lay it all over the paste; fold it up and 
wrap in a Houred towel and put in the ice box for half an hour. Roll 
it out, repeating same with another quarter of a pound of butter; roll it 
to a thickness of half an inch, fold .it in three thicknesses and roll it out 
again. If the butter breaks through, fold it again in a towel and cool for 
half an hour before using. Line a deep dish; then put in alternate layers 
of chicken, pork and sliced raw potatoes ; pour in as much gravy as the 
dish will hold. Sprinkle with a little chopped parsley, a dash more pepper 
and salt, and cover with a top crust, wetting the edges to make them 
adhere. Cut a hole in Ihe top to allow the steam to escape. 

Chicken Potpie with Stirred Dumplings. — Cut up the fowl for serving, 
wash, put in a deep stewpan, and add three pints of boiling water, salt, 
peppeF and a bay leaf. Cook one large onion, and about three slices each 
of turnip and carrot, in a tablespoonful of butter, and cook till soft; 
mash and add to slew; then dip out two tablespoonfuls of the fat from 
the stew, put with the butler, and when boiling stir in three tablespoonfuls 
of flour. Stir over the fire till brown, then stir into the chicken to 
thicken it. A year-old chicken will need two hours' cooking; it should 
only simmer, without hard boiling. For dumplings, into a quart of wheat 
flour sift two heaping teaspoonfuls of baking powder and a half tea- 
spoonful of salt. Sift at least three times. Then stir in rich, sweet milk 
to make a batter, not thick as can be stirred nor yet soft enough to run. 
Drop in spoonfuls over the top of the boiling potpie a half hour before 



29 TfiB RURAL COOK BOOK. 

dinner time. Should there be so much gravy that the batter would sink 
beneath its surface remove a bowlful. Cover closely and keep constantly 
boiling. Serve the dinner on a large meat platter, arranging the dumplings 
about its border, heaping the meat and potatoes in the center and serving 
the gravy from a gravy boat. In taking up the dumplings tear them apart 
with two forks instead of using a knife or spoon. 

Smothered Chicken. — Have a year-old chicken split as for broiling. 
Wipe dry, spread it liberally with butter all over, dust with flour and 
pepper, and place, skin side down, in a dripping pan (over a meat rack). 
Pour in a cupful boiiing water, add a few sprigs of parsley, cover closely 
and bake in a hot oven one hour. Then torn the chicken skin side up, 
sprinkle with a half teaspoonful of salt, and brown uncovered, 10 or 15 
minutes. Cut up the giblets, which have been cooked tender in one pint 
of water, add a level dessertspoonful flour and a lump of butter the size 
of an egg with the water from the giblets, which will be reduced to about 
a cupful, and stir all in the dripping pan, seasoning with a saltspoonful 
of salt, a good dash of pepper, parsley or sweet marjoram. Joint the 
chicken that it' may be easily carved, but do not separate it. Serve on a 
platter with the gravy poured around. 

Victoria Chicken. — Procure a young chicken of three and one-half 
pounds in weight, singe, draw and wash it, cut the chicken into 10 pieces, 
season with half teaspoonful pepper, "and half tablespoonful of salt; rub 
the seasoning and the chicken well together. Cut half pound bacon into 
slices, remove the rind and place the bacon in a pan of boiling water, let 
it lie five minutes, then drain. Put -the bacon into a saucepan and fry to 
a delicate brown, then take out (he bacon. Put the chicken into the bacon 
fat, add half tablespoonful butter, cover and cook slowly for 30 minutes, 
turning the chicken with a fork three times during that time, then lay 
the chicken 'n a round pan with the slices of bacon between, pour over 
three cups of cream, cover the pan and bake one hour in a medium-hot 
oven. When ready to serve lay the chicken on a hot dish, and lay six 
bread croutons in a circle around the dish, strain the sauce over the 
chicken and serve. 

Deviled Mutton,— This is a nice way to warm up cold roast mutton 6t 
lamb. Put one teaspoonful of chopped onion into a stewpan with one 
ounce of butter. Place it over a slow lire, keep the onions stirred until 
rather brown, then add some flour, mix it in well and fry for five min- 
utes; then pour In one-half pint of gravy well seasoned, and let it boil 
until thickened and brown ; add one teaspoonful of sugar and one of 
vinegar, one of Worcestershire sauce, a few chopped gherkins and a few 
button mushrooms if at hand ; put in the mutton, which has been pre- 
viously sliced in thin slices and perfectly free from fat; let it remain x 
few minutes and simmer, not boil.

Flank Steak, Rolled. — Spread a steak weighing about 2'/i pounds with 
a dressing composed of lyi cupful bread crumbs — dip the crusts previously 
in boiling water that they may easily crumble — one medium-sized onion, 
two tablespoonfuls canned tomato, one beaten egg, one tablespoonful 
butter, one teaspoonful salt, one-quarter teaspoonful pepper. Stir egg 
with bread, add the onion sliced, tomato, butter and seasoning. After 
spreading roll snugly and tie with pieces of string. Lay three slices of 
salt pork on top, place in dripping pan with one-half cupful water. Roast 
slowly one hour. May be eaten hot with gravy, or cold. 

Goulash.— Cut two leeks or onions, small-sized ones, into 6ne pieces, 
and fry them in hot butter till Ihey are brown. Add one cupful of beef 
broth, a little salt, half a teaspoonful of paprika or red pepper, and 
half a teaspoonful of browned flour. Stir until smooth, then strain. 
Have ready one-half pound of raw steak, cut into quarter-inch squares. 
The better the steak, necessarily, the better tSe result will be, and there- 
fore porterhouse is preferred. Toss the meat into a frying pan just long 
enough to cook the outside, then add the sauce. Add two warm boiled 
potatoes, cut into good-sized pieces, and let the pan remain on the back 
of ihe stove 15 minutes before serving. 

Goose, Braised,— Braised goose is superior to a roast, in the taste of 
many, the bird acquiring flavor from the vegetables with it. The oven 
is the place for the cooking, and a porcelain -lined iron pot or earthen 
cooking crock (either having a tight-fitting cover) gives the best results. 
Prepare the goose as for roasting, but do not stuff. In the baking dish 
put a layer of chopped or sliced onions, celery, turnips, carrots and two 
apples. Sprinkle with a teaspoonful of salt, one of powdered sage and 
six shakes of pepper. Lay the goose upon them, pour over il two cupfuls 
of boiling water, dredge with salt, pepper, powdered sage and flour. Cover 
closely and cook slowly for at least four hours (allow 35 minutes lo the 
pound). Turn the goose every two hours. Add more water if necessary. 
Less time is required if a roaster is used. When tender, remove the 
goose. Rub the vegetables and gravy through a colander, return to the 
fire and stir in a tablespoonful of browned flour. Boil up once and serve 
in a boat. Garnish (he goose with parsley. 

Gumbo. — This takes four hours to make. Put into a kettle two pounds 
of lean soup beef, one-half a chicken that has been jointed, a small ham 
bone, or a good-sized slice of lean bacon, a slice of green pepper and a 
square inch of onion. Add three quarts of water and boil or simmer 
gently, skimming often for two hours. At the end of this time add three 
pints of okra that has first been cut in slices and fried lightly in a very 
small amount of butter, also a large potato cut in pieces, which gradually 
breaks and thickens the soup. An hour later, after frequent skimmings, 
add a full quart of tomatoes and the corn cut from two large ears, also 



BO THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

the cdbi, and boil gently for another hour. Then remove the corncobs 
and what is left of the beef, and the chicken bones, leaving the chicken 
meat in the stew ; season with salt, cayenne pepper, a teaspoonftil of 
Worcestershire sauce and a teaspoonful of sugar, and it is ready to serve. 
Dry boiled rice is nice served with this gumbo, which is a stew rather 
than a soup. Many recipes for gumbo call for a small quantity of "fillet 
powder"; this is the tender young green leaves of sassafras powdered. 

Ham, Curing. — This is a Virginia method. For curing four hams, 
averaging IS pounds each, have ready one and a half gallons of the best 
salt, one pound of good brown sugar, one-eighth pound of powdered 
saltpeter, one ounce of black pepper and one-half ounce of cayenne. Cut 
the joints into proper shapes, without unnecessary bone and fat, and lay 
them on a board on table. First rub the skin well with salt and lay 
each joint aside, then begin over again, and into the fleshy side of each 
ham rub two teaspoonfuls of saltpeter and a tablespoonful of brown 
sugar mixed together. Rub the pepper, particularly, about the hock and 
under the bone and give to the whole ham a good application of salt. 
Now pack the hams, one upon another, the skin side downward, with a 
layer of salt between, into a tub or box, the bottom of which has also 
been covered "with salt. The process of salting will be complete in five 
weeks. At the end of that time have ready about a peck of hickory 
a&hes ; clean the hams with a brush or dry cloth and rub them with the 
ashes. To smoke the hams the joints should be hung from joists beneath 
the ceiling and a slow, smothered fire kept up for five or six weeks, so 
as to smoke thoroughly, but not overheat the hams. Or, as an excellent 
substitute for this process, paint the hams with a coating of pyroligneous 
acid, let them dry and repeat the operation. Wrap each ham in paper 
and encase it in a canvas or strong cotton bag. 

A simple way to salt bacon and hams in brine is to rub the meat well 
with salt, especially into the exposed ends of bones, and then pack into 
a barrel, with a layer of salt between each piece. Allow the meat to 
remain thus for 48 hours, then pour over all a brine strong enough to 
bear up an egg. Let the meat remain in pickle six weeks ; then smoke. 

Molasses pickle is made as follows : To four quarts of fine salt and 
two ounces of pulverized saltpeter add enough molasses to make a paste. 
Hang the hams in a cool dry place for three or four days after cutting 
up; then cover with the pickle mixture, thickest on the flesh side, and lay 
them skin down for three or four days. For 100 pounds of ham make 
brine in the following proportion : Seven pounds coarse salt ; two ounces 
saltpeter; one-half ounce pearlash; four gallons soft water. Heat grad- 
ually, removing all scum as it arises, then cool. Pack the hams in a 
barrel, pour the brine over them, and keep in pickle five to eight weeks, 
according to size. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 31 

Ham, Sugar Cured. — To 50 pounds of ham or "side bacon" allow three 
pounds of sugar and a pint of molasses, six pounds of salt, one fuH 

tablespoonful of saleratus and the same of saltpeter. Cover the bottom 
of your firkin with salt (about two pounds). Mix sugar, molasses, salt- 
peter, saleratus and the remaining salt into a paste. Rub each piece 
thoroughly with Ihis, work it in well and hard, and pack into the firkin, 
the rind downward. Cover all with cold water— just enough to rise above 
the meat. Lay a heavy board on top, weight it with a stone to keep the 
meat under water, and leave it thus for four weeks, turning the meat and 
stirring up the pickle every week. Take out, then wipe, rub into the 
pieces as much dry salt and an equal quantity of sugar as they will take 
up; pack in a dry firkin and leave for 24 hours before sending to the 
smokehouse, 

Hamburg Steak, Baked.— One and one-half pound raw chopped beef, 
two cupfuls of stale bread softened with half a cupful of hot milk and 
cooled, two eggs, small onion minced, teaspoonfol of salt, saltspoonful 
of pepper and pinch of ginger. Mix well and shape into a square; place 
in baking pan with a tablespoonful of tomato, small onion and butter 
the size of a walnut on top of meat. Bake one hour, basting frequently. 
The potatoes should be boiled 15 minutes, then drained, pared and placed 
in pan with the Hamburg steak to cook 45 minutes, being turned and 
basted often. Medium-sized potatoes are best for this. Serve arranged 
around the meat. 

Hungarian Hamburg Steak, — Beat an egg into a bowl, stir in bread 
crumbs (about a cupful), a small onion, grated, salt and paprika (a mtld- 
flavored cayenne pepper). The meat is stirred into this, and after thor- 
ough mixing is formed into a ball. An onion is fried brown in butter, 
put into an earthen saucepan with a tight-litting cover, and the meat ball 
is added, with two tomatoes cut into quarters around it. After simmering 
for half an hour the meat is turned gently, so as not to break the ball, 
then allowed to cook quietly for nearly an hour, and served with the 
vegetables as a garnish. 

Senator Hanna's Hash. — This is the recipe given by the Boston Cook- 
ing School. Take equal portions of tender boiled corned beef and mealy 
boiled potatoes. Cut the potatoes Into small cubes and the meat as fine 
as possible. Mix thoroughly with these a small onion, chopped very fine; 
a slice of onion is often sufficient. Butter a hot frying pan and turn into 
it chopped materials. Press into the center of the mass a clove of garlic, 
wrapped in a piece of salt pork or mild cured bacon. Set over a moderate 
fire, cover and let cook, adding a small quantity of water, if moist hash 
is preferred; when heated, stir, remove the garlic and give the whole 
round shape. Let stand in the oven until browned underneath, then 
carefully slide on a serving dish. While the hash is cooking cut one or

two Bermuda onions into thin slices and fry until crisp in deep fat Use 
these as a garnish for the hash (or omit if preferred). Serve with lemon 
quarters. 

Hot-pot. — Two pounds of cross-rib is cut in small pieces and put in 
an earthen saucepan, with two minced onions, five or six small green pep- 
pers, whole, a few chives, a handful of seeded raisins, a cupful of to- 
matoes, peeled and sliced, eight or 10 olives, a bit of thyme, a big table- 
spoonful of drippings, sail to taste, and a cupful of vinegar and water. 
The pot is covered tightly, and the mixture simmered slowly until the 
meat is cooked to pieces ; then a tablespoonful of butter well coated with 
flour is stirred in to thicken the gravy. 

Liver and Bacon in Casserole. — Slice liver about half an inch thick, 
and put in a buttered saucepan, peppering lightly. Over the liver lay a 
dozen thin slices of bacon, and strew these with chopped onion and par* 
sley. Cover closely and cook slowly for about two hours. The cooking 
must not be hurried. When ready to serve the liver, let the gravy, with 
the bacon in it, boil hard for two minutes, then pour it over the the 
liver in the serving dish. 

Liver. Fried in New Orleans Style, — Cut a pound of calf's liver in half- 
inch cubes. After washing and draining, place in a bowl which has been 
ruhbed with an onion. Between two layers of liver place a layer of 
chopped onion and parsley, sprinkling with salt and dusting lightly with 
cayenne. After half an hour take out the liver and shake oR all the 
onion. Roll lightly in flour and drop into a deep kettle of boiling fat. 
Drain on paper and serve very hot with lemon. The liver cooks to de- 
licious tenderness and delicacy of flavor. 

Calves' Liver, English Style. — Two pounds of fresh liver, one-half 
pound fat salt pork, one spoonful of butter, half an onion, one spoonful 
chopped parsley and pepper. Put the butter in a warm, not hot, sauce- 
pan, cut (he liver into slices half an inch thick and lay upon the butter; 
mince the pork and cover the liver; sprinkle the parsley and onion with 
pepper on top; cover the saucepan closely and set it into a kettle of hot 
water; keep this water below the boiling point for an hour, then lei it 
boil another hour; the liver will by this time be very tender and juicy 
if the heat has been properly adjusted. Take it out and place it in a 
dish to keep warm. Thicken the gravy with brown butter and pour over 
the liver and serve. 

English Meat Pie,— Chop cold beef finely, put in a deep baking dish 
a layer of the meal, strew lightly with bread crumbs, season highly with 
sslt, pepper, butter and a few drops of onion juice; repeat the process 
till the dish is full or your meat used up. Pour over it a cup of stock 
or gravy, or, lacking these, hot water with a teaspoonful of butter melted 
in it; on top a good layer of bread crumbs should be put and seasoned

tod dotted with butter. Cover and bake half an hour; remove the cover 
and brown. 

Mock Duck. — Four pork tenderloins ; slash lengthwise, rub with salt 
and pepper, fill wilii dressing made of bread crumbs, one onion, one egg, 
one-half cupful butter, salt and pepper to taste; tie together and bake in 
roaster. Serve with hot apple sauce made as follows : Pare and quarter 
(if large, cut in. eighths) as many apples as the family appetite requires. 
Put 3 layer of apples in a granite or enameled shallow pan, put bits of 
butter, goodly supply sugar and dash of cinnamon on the apples. Do this 
in layers till pan is full ; add a little water and bake till rich and clear, 
not just barely done. 

Mutton Mince With Eggs. — Scrape every morsel of meat from the 
bone, crack the latter, cover with cold water and let it simmer at the 
hack of the stove for four or five hours. Strain off the cupful of liquid 
and thicken with a. lump of butter rolled in browned flour; season with 
salt, pepper and tomato catsup ; stir into it the cold mutton cut small 
and a handful of bread crumbs, strewing some of these on top ; bake 
until the surface bubbles, drop four or five eggs upon the top, pepper 
and salt them, set back in the oven and leave there until the eggs are 
"set." 

Mutton Fie. — A mutton pie made from the neck of mutton is as 
savory as it is economical. Cut off the spine bone and the scrag end, 
shorten the ribs to about three inches, but save all these trimmings to 
make the gravy for the pie. Cut the mutton into neat chops, pare off 
the fat, season with salt and pepper and place in the deep pie dish in a 
circle, one lapping over the other. Fill the center with tiny potato Ijalls 
cut out with the cutter; add the mutton gravy which has been boiled to 
make the quantity required, sprinkle with salt and pepper, cover with good 
pie crust brushed over with the yolk of an egg and bake for an hour 
;>nd a half in a moderate oven. 

Ragout of Mutton, — Use two pounds of mutton from the shoulder or 
breast Cut in small pieces, about two inches square. Cut up some of 
the mutton fat which has not touched the skin and fry slowly in ■ pan 
until there is about a gill of liquid fat; lake out the solid pieces and put 
in the mutton and stir until it becomes brown. Take the meat from the 
fat, being careful to press out all the fat. To the fat add one pint of 
turnip cubes and two tablespoonfuls of onion cut fine ; cook slowly for 
10 minutes, then take them out and put in the stew pan with the meat. 
Pour the fat from the frying pan and put in two tablespoonfuls of butter 
and the same amount of flour; stir until brown, when add one quart of 
boihng water. When this thickens add it to the meat and vegetables with 
a rounding teaspoonful of salt and one-third of a teaspoonful of pepper. 
Simmer for three hours, covered. 



84 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

"Pawnhas." — This old-fashioned dish is similar to scrapple. Boil to- 
gether the "jowls," liver and heart of a hog until very tender. Take out 
all bones, chop the heart and meat from jowls until very line;; crumble 
the liver as finely as possible and put all back into' the kettle. Now 
season with pepper and salt, and be sure to add enough water to keep 
it from being too rich or greasy. Stir in white cornmeal until you have 
a thin mush, let cook slowly half an hour, pour into a large crock or 
jar; set away to cool. When cold, slice like mush and put into a skillel 
to fry. Add no grease. This is delicious and will keep indefinitely in 
a cool place. 

Pigeons, Potted. — Place six cleaned birds in a deep kettle with one 
pint of vinegar and three onions, halved; let stand over night, then throw 
the vinegar and onions away. Brown six slices of pork and two onions, 
sliced; place in the kettle with the pigeons; add one pint of hot water, 
salt and pepper; cover and simmer about two hours; serve the pigeons 
on a hot dish about a mound of parsley; strain the liquor, thicken, and 
pass in a gravy boat. 

Pigs' Feet in Jelly. — Thoroughly scrape and clean one dozen pigs' feet 
Place them in a kettle, cover with boiling water, add one tablespoonful 
of salt and simmer steadily until tender. Transfer the feet to a stone 
crock, placing between them thin slices of onion. Heat and boil to- 
gether for five minutes two quarts of good vinegar, one bay leaf, two 
tablespoon fuls of sugar, one dozen whole cloves, six tiny red peppers, and 
one-half teaspoonful of salt. Add one 4uart of boiling water and pour 
at once over the pigs' feet. Cover and let stand two days before using. 

Pilgrim Pie. — Cut a two-pound piece of fresh pork into dice, after it 
is cooked, and prepare the following crust : One pint mashed potatoes, 
otrf-half teaspoonful salt, one tablespoonful butter, one-fourth teaspoon- 
ful pepper, one-fourth cup of milk, one level teaspoonful baking powder, 
nod enough flour to make a crust which can be easily rolled out one 
inch thick. Put alternate layers, in a baking dish, of the diced pork, 
raw oysters, minced parsley, a light dusting of Summer savory, finely 
shredded onion, with salt and pepper to suit, and one tablespoonful but- 
ter; cover with a brown sauce; fit a cover of the potato biscuit and bake 
in hot oven 20 minutes. Five minutes before it is finished draw out, cover 
with fine cracker crumbs mixed with one egg; return to the oven to 
finish browning; garnish with parsley. This potato crust is excellent for 
any meat pie. 

Pork With Corn Dumplings.— Cook a piece of shoulder of pork in a 
big pot unt:l tender; then mix the desired quantity of cornmeal to « 
thick dough as in making bread (the addition of an egg to the dough im- 
proves the dumplings). Prop balls of the dough about the size of a 
walnut in the boiling water about the meat in the pot and cook 30 min- 



TUB RURAL COOK BOOK. 35 

vtes, when the dumplings will be done, and will have a thick gravy 
around them. Take care not to let the mixture burn. The fat and 
juices of the meat season the dumplings excellently. 

Rabbit, Ju^ed. — Select a plump tender rabbit. Wash, wipe dry, and 
cut into well-shaped pieces. Have ready a teaspoonful of salt and one- 
fcurth teajpoonful of pepper and rub this into the rabbit pieces. Put 
four table spoonfuls of flour on a plate and roll each piece in this. Heat 
half a cupful of butter in frying pan; when hot fry the rabbit, browning 
on both sides, being careful not to burn the butter. As soon as it 
browns put the rabbit into a stcwpan and into the hot butter stir what is 
left of the flour in which the rabbit was rolled ; add three teacupfuls hot 
water and cook lo minutes. Pour this over the rabbit, adding two 
cloves, one-half bayleaf, two or three allspice, one teaspoonful salt, one- 
fourth teaspoonful pepper, a slice or two of onion. Cover closely and 
simmer for an hour and a half. Add one teaspoonful lemon juice and 
one tablespoonful good catsup. Remove the rabbit to a hot platter; 
Strain what liquid is left, add to it a teaspoonful each of butter and flour 
rubbed smooth and a cupful of hot water; boil up once, pour over the 
rabbit and serve. 

Rabbit, Breaded. — Dress the rabbit, then let it soak over night in cold 
salt water. Cut into neat pieces, and boil gently until tender in clear 
water to which an onion has been added. Let it cool and drain ; then 
dip in well-beaten egg, roll in cracker crumbs and fry in hot butter. 
Serve with cranberry sauce. Barbecued rabbit, a favorite southern dish, 
may also be recommended : Lay the rabbit in salt and water 30 minutes, 
then scald with boiling water and wipe dry, rub well with butter, and 
sprinkle with pepper and salt. Broil until quite brown, and lay on a 
hot dish; butter plentifully on both sides. Prepare a sauce of four tea- 
spoonfuls of vinegar, one teaspoonful of made mustard, one of currant 
jelly and one of walnut catsup. Pour this hot over the rabbit. 

Ragout with Dumplings. — Get a piece of nice, fresh round steak, 
about one and one-half pound (cut thick). Cut it into pieces about an 
inch square, smother it with flour, well seasoned with salt and red pep- 
per. Brown in the frying pan one large onion or two small ones, with 
about one large tablespoonful of butter; then add the steak and brown. 
Put the whole into a granite saucepan, pour over it live pints of boiling 
water and simmer two hours. About SO minutes before serving make 
dumplings as follows: A cup of flour sifted with a little sah and a half 
teaspoonful of baking powder, and rub in a teaspoonful of butter. Mix 
very soft with milk— so soft that it is slightly sticky; drop by small 
spoonfuls into the stew and cover tightly until served. 

Sausage. — This is a Virginia recipe. To every 10 pounds of meat 
use three ounces of salt, one of black pepper, one-half ounce of sage

rubbed fine. Having all ingredtents weighed, put a layer of the meal 
cut in strips, sprinkle the mixed seasoning over it, another layer of meat 
with more seasoning, distributing as evenly as possible. Run twice 
throungh the grinder, and when it is put on the table it is surprising 
to see how quickly it vanishes. Ordinary pork sausage, smoked in bags, 
makes a desirable change, and keeps welt. Pack the sausage meat in 
small bags of coarse, strong muslin, the size selected being that most 
convenient for slicing; small salt sacks, well washed, may answer. Qose 
the bags, and then smoke, just like ham, the amount of smoking depend- 
mg on the family taste. When used, split down the seam of the bag 
for convenience in cutting the slices, and fry like ham. 

Sausage, Bologna.^Six pounds of lean beef; one pound salt pork; 
three pounds lean fresh pork; one pound beef suet; one ounce white pep- 
per; one teaspoonful ground mace; three ounces salt; one teaspoonful 
cayenne; one large onion chopped fine. Chop the meat and suet sep- 
arately very fine, then mix; add all the seasoning, and mix thoroughly. 
Fill into casings and tie into lengths, or use strong linen bags. Make a 
brine that will bear an egg; put the sausage into it, and let stand two 
weeks, turning and skimming every day. At the end of the first week 
throw away the old brine, and put the sausage into new for the second 
week; then smoke for a week. When smoked rub over the outside with 
olive oil, and store in a cool, dark dry place. If you wish to keep the 
sausage for any length of time sprinkle the outside with pepper. 

Sausage, Frankfurter. — Chop up pork, lean meat and fat (ham can 
be used) in the proportion of four pounds lean to one of fat. To a 
pound of the mixture season with salt, ii grams, one-half gram salt- 
petre, two grams white pepper and one-half gram cloves. Mix the whole 
so intimately that "you cannot tell the fat pieces from the leaa" The 
more thorough the mixing the better the result. If the mixing is not 
free, you can add a little water, but do not overdo this. If too "waxy" 
from excess of fat, add lean; or, the other way, if too meaty. Use pig's 
cases for^he filling. Tie the sausage in length desired. Hang the links 
well apart in the smokehouse. Tolerable heat will do them rightly 
enough, but if you want the deep rich tint of brown, you will have to 
finish them off over a brick fire. It is hard to fix the temperature, 
as the smokehouse in the open will be cooler than the one indoors. Test 
the state by running a quill in and examining the extract by the taste, 
sight and smell. Sometimes they are put in bundles of 10 or 18 folded 
together and pressed to flatten. Keep in a box under weight before put- 
ting in the smoke. 

Sausage, Holland Home,.— Grind, mix and season the meat as de- 
■ired. Instead of stuffing "cases," pack in half-gallon stone jars (but- 
ter jari). Bake four hours in a moderately hot oven. Remove from 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK, 37 

the oven and press with a heavy weight 12 hours — over ntght usually. 
Then remove the weight. There will be some fat, but not enough to 
cover it. Heat lard to the boiling point and pour over enough to cover. 
This seals— excludes the air. Keep in a cool place. Beef or pork may be 
kept in this way indefinitely. 

Oxford Sausage.— One pound each of finely chopped veal, pork and 
beef suet. Mix through this one quart of bread-crumbs, grated peel of 
half a temon, a grated nutmeg, a sprig each of savory, thyme and sweet 
marjoram nnd a tabtespoonful of powdered sage leaves. Make in cakes 
and fry in very little hot butter. 

Sausage, Pork and Beef.— For 10 pounds of sausage use seven and 
one-half pounds of pork and two and a half of beef; grind fine, add two 
tablespoonfuls of salt, one teaspoonful each of pepper, allspice, cloves and 
sage. Heat all together until so hot you cannot hold your finger in it. 
Turn into stone jars that have been thoroughly scalded and aired, cover 
with cheesecloth and pour hot suet over the cloth. When any is wanted 
for use, take out and make into cakes and fry. 

Summer Sausage. — Use any recipe you like best, but use cloih casings 
made from muslin, casings to have a diameter of three to four inches, 
and length to fit a baking pan. Casings are easily made with sewing 
machine. Smoke the finished sausage to your heart's content. After 
smoking let sausage dry sufficiently, which takes four or five weeks, de- 
pending on where hung to dry. The sausage should be fit for eating, 
which can readily be ascertained by cutting one through. When dry 
enough melt a quantity of paraffin — about one-half pound for a dozen 
sausages — put in baking pan, then place the sausages therein and roll 
about in the hot parafGn, one at a, time. Hang up in a dry place and 
they will keep nicely and indefinitely. 

Virginia Beef Sausage. — Mix two cupfuls of finely-chopped raw beef, 
I'/i cupful of fat salt pork minced very fine, two teaspoonfuls of pow- 
dered sage, a scant teaspoonfal of pepper — the pork should furnish suffi- 
cient salt — and one tablespoonful of lemon juice. When thoroughly 
mixed pack it in small round tin cans and set away to become hard. 
When wanted for breakfast slice three-fourths of an inch thick and 
either brown in the oven or fry in a hot, well-greased pan. 

Scrapple, Philadelphia— Take a cleaned pig's head and boil until the 
flesh strips easily from the bones. Remove all the bones and chop fine. 
Set the liquor in which the meat was boiled aside until cold, take the 
cake of fat from the surface and return the liquor to the fire. When it 
boils, put in the chopped meat and season well with pepper and salt. Let 
it boil again and thicken with cornmeal as you would in making ordinary 
cornmeal mush, by letting it slip slowly through the fingers to prevent 
lumps. Cook an hour, stirring constantly at first, afterward putting bac'- 



38 * THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

on the range in a position to boil gently. When done, pour into a long, 
square pan, not too deep, and mold. In cold weather this cao be kept 
several weeks. Slice and fry brown in butter or dripping. 

Souse. — Clean pig's ears and feet well ; cover them with cold water 
slightly salted and boil until tender. Pack in stone jars while hot, and 
cover while you make ready for pickle. To half a gallon of good cider 
vinegar allow half a ciip of white sugar, three .dozen whole black pep- 
pers, a dozen blades of mace and a dozen cloves. Boil this one minute. 
taking care that it really boils, and pour while hot over the still warm 
feet and ears. It will be ready to use in two days and will keep in a cool 
place for two months. If you wish it for breakfast, make a batter of 
one egg, one cup of milk, salt to taste, and a teaspoonful of butter, with 
enough flour for a thin muffin batter; dip each piece in this and fry in 
hot lard or dripping. Or dip each in beaten egg, then in pounded 
cracker before frying. Souse is also good eaten cold, especially the feet. 

Stew, Oven. — Two or three pounds of beef shin are selected, the bone 
being broken into three or four pieces. After wiping with a damp cloth, 
remove all the meat from the bone and cut into small pieces for serving. 
Scrape the marrow from the bone and place in a kettle, and in it brown 
first the meat, then the vegetables cut in cubes — half an onion and one 
carrot. Now dredge well with flour and salt, adding about a tablespoon- 
iul of browned flour to give color. Add one or two whole cloves, one- 
half cup of tomato or a little tomato catsup, then the pieces of bone. 
Cook in the oven in a deep iron meat-pan for three or four hours, adding 
potatoes, cut in cubes, one hour before serving. 

Stew. Tomato. — Fry a tiny onion, or a slice or two of ordinary size, 
in a couple of tablespoonfuls of fat. Add two or three slices of carrot 
and let them brown. Then stir in a cupful of canned tomatoes and half a 
cupful of beef stock or gravy. If stock is used the mixture should be 
thickened with a little flour. Add also half a bayieaf and a couple of 
sprays of Summer savory, and simmer the stew slowly for half an hour, 
so that it may be permeated with the seasonings. At the end of this time 
add the cold meat from a shank of beef, or any "leftover," cut in small 
pieces. Simmer very slowly tor five or 10 minutes and serve hot, after 
dashing in a little salt and pepper. 

Tough Meat. — To soften a tough steak pour a few spoonfuls of vine- 
gar, or vinegar and oil mixed, over it, and allow it to stand 13 to 34 
hours, turning occasionally. A tough piece of meat may be laid in vine- 
gar (not too strong) for three or four days in Summer, or twice as long in 
Winter. Oil or spices may be added to the vinegar if desired, this bath 
being termed a marinade. Tough meat should receive long gentle cook- 
ing, preferably in an enclosed vessel which will prevent evaporation of 
juices. Such beef should not be treated like a tender rib roast; it would 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 39 

better be braised (pot roast) or cooked as beef a la mode. The mar- 
inade will be found desirable when the meat is cooked in this way. If 
stewed, the same system of piolonged gentle cooking (preferably in an 
earthen stewpan or casserole) should be employed. 

Stuffed Tenderloin. — Procure a good-sized tenderloin, slit one side 
open and lay within a dressing made as follows : One cupful of dry grated 
crumbs, one tablespoonful of minced parseley, one large teaspoonful of 
mixed sweet herbs, thyme. Summer savory, sweet marjoram and sage, 
one heaping teaspoonful of liuely chopped onion fried in one tablespoon- 
ful of butter, one-half teaspoonful salt, one saltspoonful pepper. If this 
amount of butter does not make it moist enough add a trifle more melted 
butter, but no water. Stuff the tenderloin and sew up the opening. If 
it is not fat place two or three slices of bacon over the top, fastening 
with wooden toothpicks. Rub into the meat one teaspoonful of salt, one- 
fourth teaspoonful of white pepper. Dust with flour and roast. When 
done remove the tenderloin to a heated platter and put the roasting pan 
on top of stove, adding one tablespoonful of flour to the gravy which it 
contains. When thoroughly browned add a cupful of hot water, two 
tablespoon fuls of chopped gherkins, and one tablespoonful of finely- 
chopped olives. 

Veal and Ham Pie.— A pound of veal cutlet cut in small pieces is 
rolled in flour and browned in hot bacon fat. Cover with boiling water, 
or, if possible, with stock made from the trimmings of veal and seasoned 
with sweet herbs, carrot and onion, and simmer for about two hours 
Put the pieces of veal in a baking dish. Have ready half a cupful of 
finely chopped cooked ham. Add to it a little of the liquid in which the 
veal was cooked, and pound smooth in a mortar. Then press through a 
pur^e sieve, and add the rest of the liquid with such seasoning as may 
be desired. Pour this over ihe meat in the dish, adding half a pint of 
oysters and a few bits of butter. Cover the dish with a pastry or rich 
biscuit crust, and bake about 25 minutes. 

Veal, Paprika Schnitzel. — Cut two pounds of thick veal steak into 
small pieces, roll in seasoned flour, fry brown in salt pork fat. Remove 
the meat from the pan, add two tablespoonfuls of flour to the remaining 
fat, brown lightly and pour in the strained liquid from a pint can of to- 
matoes, or if desired slice in a pint of fresh peeled tomatoes. Add a 
slice each of onion and carrot, three bay leaves and a bit of mace, then 
return the meat to the sauce, cover closely and simmer for three-quarters 
of an hour. When done remove the meat, add a little more salt if neces- 
sary (the pork helps to season) a pinch of paprika or red pepper, and 
strain on to the platter.

PASTRY AND PIES. 

When pieplant B^vea the Ont good meas, 
With Dice hot biscuit, I confess 

Our lolkB feel good. Pop says ; "I sucbb 
Yau ougbt tu have a hraa' nen dreaa." 



Some of our friends, who have spent manj years abroad, tell of a 
Roman pension or boarding-house whose proprietor boasted that he had 
recipes for more than 365 delicious desserts. During the months our 
friends were at the pension they never had the same dessert twice, which, 
they complained, was really pathetic, for many of the dishes were so 
delicious that they longed for a repetition. We doubt whether anyone 
could duplicate that experience in an American boarding-house, where, 
too often, pie is almost (he only form of dessert, except a restricted range 
of puddings. The unwholesome effect of pastry often results, we believe, 
from eating it as the finish to a hearty meal, when the digestion is already 
fully tasked. We are told by those who use it that the oil pie crust, 
recipe for which is given, is more easily digested than that made with 
other shortening. 

Pie Crust. — For one pie use one cupful sifted Hour, one-half cup of 
shortening, pinch of salt. It will be much flakier if chopped together 
with a knife, instead of rubbing in the hands. Stir in enough cold water 
to mix it so it may be rolled out. Handle as little as possible, and keep 
very cold. It is improved by making a day before using, and storing in 
. the icebox or. other cold place. 

Cream Pie Crust.^If one can use cream, delicious crust may be made. 
Add baking powder and salt to the flour and mix still with cream that is 
not too heavy. The crust is tender, browns quickly and has a very sweet, 
agreeable flavor. 

Oil Fie Crust. — For this either olive or refined cotton-seed oil may 
be used. For one pie take one cup flour, add pinch of salt, mix and add 
two tablespoonfuls oil; rub well together and add three tablespoonfuU 
cold water. Handle dough as little as possible and roll thin. 

Puff Paste.— Use equal weights of flour and butter; by measure, one 
pint of flour and one cup of butter. Wash the butter in cold water 
until all the salt is out; the hands should first be washed in hot, then 
<»ld water, to prevent the butler from sticking. When washed until 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. « 

■mooth and waxy divide butter into four parts, pat until tbin, wrap in 

a napkin and place upon ice. Mix a little salt with the flour, mix in 
about one-balf clip of ice water, stirring it in with a knife, and cut 
nntil it can be taken up dean from the bowl. Put on a well-floured 
board, roll until one-half inch thick. Roll one portion of the butter tbin, 
fold it up inside the paste, pat and roll out again. Repeat this process 
with the rest of the butter. When putting in the butter, fold the sides 
of the paste over it toward the middle, then the ends over, and double; 
then roll. This process should continue until no streaks of fat are shown. 
Whenever the butter becomes soft, it should be chilled, and when finished 
the paste should be wrapped in a napkin, and kept in the refrigerator. 
This is the paste used for patty cases, and similar delicate pastry. It 
requires a "knack" is well as a recipe to get good results. 

Crust for Raised Pies. — This is the crust used by English house- 
keepers for pork and other meat pies, in which the crust is patted and 
shaped into 3 deep dish shape, which is filled with meat and then covered 
with a top crust. The crust is hard and stiff when cold, but soften; 
when warm. Put one. cupful of water in a saucepan, add one poUnd of 
lard, put on stove to melt, and allow it to come to boiling point, stirring 
well ; sift about three pounds of flour into a bowl, make a hole in the 
middle, and stir in the hot liquid, mixing with a spoon until it, \i cool 
enough to knead with the hands. It may require the addition of more 
flour, as it should be very stiff. To make a pork pie, this crust should 
be molded with the hands into a dish shape four or five inches deep; 
an oval four or five by six inches is a convenient size. Good, tender, 
fresh roasting pork is cut into half-inch pieces, and well seasoned; the 
pie is filled and covered, after a small amount of water is sprinkled over, 
and then the pie is baked for about V/i hour, in a steady oven. It is 
always served cold Game birds or pigeons make excellent raised pie 
also. To give a shining yellow appearance to the pastry, brush it over 
with the yolk of an egg, beaten up with two tablespoon fuls of milk, 
about 10 minutes before it is taken out of the oven. 

Almond Bars.— Roll puff paste into thin narrow strips. Beat one 
egg white slightly and mix it with two tablespoon fuls of powdered sugar 
and one cupful of finely-chopped almonds. Spread this mixture over the 
strips of paste and brown them in the oven. Sometimes the almonds art 
rolled into the paste. Mix two tablespoon fuls of powdered sugar with 
the same amount of chopped almonds and sprinkle over the paste when 
first rolled out. Fold and roll again, then repeat the process. Finally cut 
into long sticks, brush with white of an egg and brown in the oven. One 
teaspoonful of cinnamon may be used in place of the almonds, when th< 
result will be cinnamon bars. 



42 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Apple Pie. — This is how a Michigan housekeeper makes it; The under 
crust was first brushed over lightly with white of an egg and allowed to 

stand while the rest of the work went on; this to keep the juices from 
soaking into the crust before baking. Next a half cupful of sugar was 
put in, along with a half to a tablespoonful of flour, according to the 
degree of juiciness of the apples, and a generous pinch of cinnamon or 
allspice according to choice. These were rubbed smoothly together to 
insure a jelly-like consistency of the finished pie, without the unpalatable 
doughy lumps. The fruit is then added, the remainder of the sugar 
poured over (a cupful in all for very sour apples), the top dotted thickly 
with butter, and unless the apples are very juicy a dessertspoonful of 
water added. The edge of the under crust is now moistened with water, 
the top applied and the two pinched neatly together; the whole brushed 
over with rich milk to insure an even golden-brown ness, and a tiny fnnnel 
made of writing paper twisted and pinned into shape inserted in the air 
hole cut in the top. These details observed you may now put your pie 
into the oven with a certainty that it will come out a thing of beauty, 
with none of its savory juices burning to a crisp in tbe bottom of 
the oven. For very young apples, however, she always used instead of 
the water, a generous tablespoonful of spiced vinegar (left over from 
any spiced Sweet pickle) wi(h a little more flour. Or if apples had been 
kept sofhe time and were shriveled and insipid, she found the same treat- 
ment a vast improvement. Lacking the spiced vinegar she sometimes used 
lemon juice with an additional sprinkling of sugar and spices. Other fruit 
pies were made in a similar manner, always taking into consideration the 
qualities of the fruit as to acidity and juiciness. For canned fruits 
already sweetened, such as huckleberries, elderberries and the like, which 
were very juicy and required no extra sweetening, she usually rubbed the 
flour (in same proportion of a spoonful to a pie) in a bit of the juice, 
and added it with whatever spices were necessary to the rest of the fruit, 
and set it over the fire until the flour was cooked, adding a little butter. 
When cold the mixture was filled into the prepared paste, e^K-brushed 
as before. For custard or pumpkin she usually prepared the paste by 
setting the pan on top of the stove until the crust was nearly cooked 
through, then adding the custard and putting it at once into a hot oven. 
When sweet cider is at hand, it may be used to give additional flavor to 
an apple pie. Warm half a cupful of cider and, 10 minutes before the 
pie is taken from the oven, pour the cider into it through the hole in the 
center of top crust, using a little funnel of stiff paper to prevent splashing. 

Applelcss Apple Pie. — Soak two large soda crackers in a large cup of 
boiling water. Add small piece butter. When cool add two tablespoon- 
fuls vinegar, one cup sugar, a few raisins and a little nutmeg. Bake with 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 43 

two crusts as yon do the real apple pie. Another appleless apple pte is 
made from pumpkins as follows: Procure a good sound pumpkin (or 
squash),, wash, cut a round of same, as deep as an ordinar; apple is, from 
stem to blossom end; peel, cut down crosswise in slices about an eighth 
of an inch thick; put in water enough to cover, and stew slowly until 
tender, but not mushy. Lift carefully from the water, let cool. Prepare 
crust as for apple pie, line your tins with the crust, place your slices of 
pumpkin just as you would slices of apple; sprinkle over them a little 
flour— not over a tablespoonful of sugar; add one tablespoonful of pure 
cider vinegar to each pie, a few lumps of butter, finish with a top crust. 
Bake to a rich brown color in a moderate oven. 

Vermont Blackberry Pie. — Line a deep dripping pan with pastry, cover 
(he bottom with a generous layer of blackberries, sprinkle with sugar and 
cover with a crust Bake, then add another layer of blackberries and 
sugar, cover with a top crust, and then bake again. This is recommended 
as highly delicious, either hot or cold. 

Buttermilk Pie. — Beat together a heaping cupful of sugar and four 
^gs; add half a aipful of butter; beat thoroughly and add I}^ pint of 
fresh buttermilk ; line pie tins with crust ; slice an apple thin and lay 
in each pie; fill crust with the mixture and bake with one crust. 

Butterscotch Pie.— Two eggs, one cup brown sugar, butter size of 
walnut, tablespoon of flour, one cup cream, one teaspoon vanillpi Cream 
the butter, sugar and flour together, add the beaten yolks, cream and 
flavoring. Pour this into a good baked pie crust and return to the oven. 
When it has thickened spread over it the whites beaten very stiff, with 
two level tablespoons' of sugar. Have the, oven quite cool while the 
meringue is browning. 

Carrot Pie.— Scrape the skin off the carrots, boil them soft and strain 
them through a sieve. To a pint of the strained pulp put three pints of 
milk, six beaten eggs, two tablespoonfuls of melted butler, the juice of 
half a lemon and the grated rind of a whole one. Sweeten it to your 
taste, and bake it in deep pie plates without an upper crust. 

Cheese Cakes. — This is a rich English dainty. Take tour ounces of 
butter, and cream it in a warm pan ; add four ounces of sugar, beat well ; 
add the yolk of one egg, beat again, then add one whole egg; beat all 
well together, and mix in four ounces of currants. Line patty pans 
with paste, fill with the mixture, shake a little sugar over the top, and bake. 

Curd Cheese Cakes. — Add one egg to one cupful of fresh curd; beat 
smooth,' and beat in one-half cupful of sugar, and a piece of butter the 
size of a walnut. Flavor with nutmeg or any other spice, and use as 
filling for a pie without top crust A richer curd cheese cake is made 
by using the recipe given for ordinary cheese cakes, and beating the curd 
into it before the currants are added.

Chocolate Fi&— l^ine a deep pie pan with rich pie crust and bake in ■ 
quick dren. Grate one-half teacupful of chocolate and put into a sauce- 
pan, with one cupful of hot water, butter the size of an egg, one table- 
spoonful vanilla, one cupful of sugar, the beaten yolk of two eggi and 
two tablespoon fu Is of cornstarch, dissolved in a little water; mix well; 
cook until thick, stirring constantly. Pour into the pie shell and let cooL 
Beat the whites of the two eggs to a stiff froth, add two tablespoonfuls 
of powdered sugar, spread on top of pie and slightly brown in oven. 

Cider Jelly Pie. — This ts a tested old-fashioned recipe. A half pint of 
boiled cider, a cupful of brown sugar, a cupful of boiling water and two 
tablespoonfuls of cornstarch. Stir the cornstarch into the cider, add the 
other ingredients and cook for lO toinutes. Fill into a pastry-lined pie 
tin and cover with an upper crust 

Cream Pie. — Mix thoroughly two cups of flour and five tablespoonfuls 
of butter, then add three tablespoonfuls of sugar and one large egg, which 
has been thoroughly beaten together previqjisly. Roll an eighth of an inch 
thick, line two pie tins, prick with a folk and bake a pale brown, then 
fill with this cream: Two cups milk, two tablespoonfuls of cornstarch, 
five tablespoonfuls of sugar, yolks of five eggs. Cook together like cus- 
tard, and when cold cover with meringue made of whites of five eggs and 
five tablespoons powdered sugar. 

New Cngland Cream Tart Pie. — Select firm Esopus apples and make 
as dry an apple sauce as possible, sweetened slightly and strained. For 
a large-sized pie use one pint of apple, one pint of thick cream, yolks of 
two eggs beaten stiff, and one-half of a nutmeg. An under crust only 
is used, and this may be balked the day before. Fill and bake about one- 
half hour. Use the whites of two eggs for the meringue and brown in 
the ovea Greenings are good for this pie when Esopus is not at hand, 
but apples of low quality should not be used for it 

Crumb Pie. — Soak a pint of bread crumbs in milk. Beat three eggs; 
add half a cup of sugar. Line two pie plates with crust and strew over 
enough raisins to cover bottom. Add the bread crumbs to egg and milk, 
sifting in a bit of cinnamon, pour over the raisins and bake about 30 
minutes. 

Date Pie. — For one pie take one heaping cupful of pastry flour, add a 
pinch of salt and mix to the right consistency with sweet cream. The 
crust will be much nicer if allowed to get very cold before using. Filling 
— To a cupful of seeded dates add a cupful of water, cook over hot water 
about 20 minutes, then rub through a sieve. Beat an egg and a table- 
spoonful of sugar until light ; add a tablespoonful of lemon juice, the 
date paste and gradually a cupful of scalded milk. Four into a half 
baked shell and finish baking in a moderate oven until a knife blade 
can penetrate it and come out clean. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 4S 

Delectable Tarts. — One cup of slightly sour cream, one cup of-seeded 
and chopped raisina, one cup of sugar and one egg with a delicate flavbr- 
ing of spices. Beat the egg light, add the cream and sugar; the raisins 
well floured and spices. Bake in tart or patty pans with a single crust 

Elderberry Pie. — Line a pie dish with paste, upon which sprinkle a 
scant tablespoonful of flour; to this add a half cup of sugar and a half 
teaspoonful each of cloves and cinnamon, rubbing all together evenly. 
Upon this pour the berries, a pint more or less according to the size of . 
your pie dish; pour over another half cup of sugar, dot generously with 
butter, adding last one large tablespoonful of good vinegar. Apply top 
crust quickly and bake. 

Grape Cobbler. — This is best made from very ripe black grapes. Wash 
them twice — on the bunches and after picking. Line a deep pie dish with 
half-inch rich crust, put in the grapes and all the sugar that will lie 
between them, heaping the fruit a little in the middle. Put on the top 
crust, cut cross slits in the middle and fold back the corners to leave 
an open square. Set the dish in a quick oven and while the pie bakes 
make a sauce, using half a cup of butter, one cup of sugar and one table- 
spoon boiling water. Stir well over hot water and flavor with lemon 
juice, or grated nutmeg, according to taste. When the pie is nearly done 
take it out, pour in the sauce through the opening in tfae crus^ return 
it to the oven. Be careful not to overbake, but keep it hot until served. 

Grape Roll.— Allow half the weight of the grapes in sugar and only 
water enough to keep from burning; seed the grapes; allow one pint of 
cooked grapes for the roll. To make the dough cream one-half teacupful 
of butter with one pint of sifted flour; add one teacupful of milk, two 
eggs well beaten, a saltspoonful of salt and a teaspoonful of baking 
powder; roll out on the board in two long ovals, roll up and pinch the 
ends, lay in a buttered dish, set the dish to bake and twice pour over 
them a sauce of a tablespoonful of butter and a tablespoonful of sugar 
mixed together, to which is added one-half teacupful of boiling water 
(for one basting). Serve the rolls with the same kind of sauce made 
richer and flavored 'with nutmeg. 

Green Apple Slump.— Stew and strain a quart of green apples and 
sweeten to taste. Make a biscuit crust with two cupfuls of flour, one 
heaping teaspoonful of baking powder, one tablespoonful of butter and 
one-half teaspoonful of salt, and moisten with sweet milk to a dough. 
Roll out one inch thick. Put the prepared hot sauce in a thick-bottomed 
saucepan, fit over it the crust and cover closely, first buttering the inside 
of the cover. Place where the sauce will simmer slowly but steadily 
for an hour. In serving put the crust on the dish, pour the sauce over 
it and scrre with crewn. 



46 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Hasty Pie.— Place in a deep baking pan or dish any fresh or canned 
fruits to the depth of two or three inches. Beat together one egg, two 
tablespoonfuls of mehed butter, one cupful sweet milk and one cupful of 
flour in which has been sifted one teaspoonful of baking powder. Pour 
this over fruit and bake until crust is well done. Eat with sweetened 
cream or any pudding sauce. Use but little syrup with fruit. The same 
recipe for batter makes good muffins. 

Jam Dumplings.— To one quart of sifted flour add two heaping tea- 
spoonfuls of baking powder, half teaspoonful of salt and four table- 
spoonfuls of sugar and sift several times. Beat two eggs light and add 
to ' a cup of milk ; stir into the flour, adding a large tablespoonful of

squares, put a large spoonful of jam in center of each square, pinch the 
edges together, place them in a baking pan and bake them for 25 minutes; 
serve with vanilla sauce. 

Lady Lufkins. — Make a very rich, flaky pie crust, roll out very thin, 
cut into strips an fnch wide, and wind each strip around a tube of metal 
or heavy manilta paper about two inches wide; bake until crisp and brown. 
This is the way in which bakers make their cream rolls. When cold, filj 
each roll with marmalade in the center and cream at the ends. 

Lemon Meringue. — Stir together the juice and rind of one lemon, one 
cupful of sugar, three-quarters of a cupful of water with one tablespoon- 
ful of cornstarch, and the yolks of four eggs. Bake in one crust and

sugar after having been stiffly beaten. If desired the whites of the eggs 
may be included in the filling, and two crusts used. 

Lemon Mince Pie. — Stir together two tablespoonfuls cornstarch thor- 
oughly cooked with a cupful of water, one cupful of sugar, one cupful of 
molasses, one cupful of chopped raisins, a little citron, the juice of two

the grated rind and juice of a lemon, then one cup of milk, gradually. 
Then fold in the whites of the eggs beaten to a froth. Bake in one crust. 

Maple Custard Pie.— Line a pie pan with any good paste. For the 
filling- beat together the yolks of three eggs and one pint of cream; add 
one-third cup maple sugar' shaved fine. Stir until the sugar is dissolved 
and bake in a quick oven. Delicious.

h^lf cup of mixed orange, lemon and citron peel. Strew these in the 
bottotn of the dish. Beat the yolks of four eggs with a cup of butter and 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 47 

scant cup of sugar. Heat in a double boiler until melted; then flavor with 
orange juice and little grated peel. Pour into the dish and bake three- 
quarters of an hour. 

Milk Pie. — Line a pan eight inches in diameter with good paste, put 
dots of butter over the bottom until you have used about the size of a 
walnut, dredge over alternately flour to the amount of one-fourth meas- 
uring cup and sugar to the amount of one-half cup, then sprinkle evenly 
over the top one level dessertspoon of cinnamon and pour in carefully, 
so as not to disturb the cinnamon, three-fourths cup milk and bake until 
crust is brown. 

Maryland Mincemeat. — Two pounds of lean beef ; cook, let get cold, 
and pass through meat grinder ; mix thoroughly with one pint of finely- 
minced suet, two quarts of chopped, high-flavored apples, one pint of 
stoned raisins, a scant pint of sugar, one-half pint of currants, one-third 
pound of citron shaved in fine shreds, a cupful of molasses (which is 
omitted if preferred, sugar taking its place), one tablespoonful each of 
ground mace and allspice, two tablespoonfuls of cinnamon, one-half table- 
spoonful of cloves, two grated nutmegs, one and a half tablespoonfiil of 
salt, juice and rind of one and a half lemon, same of "sour orai^e, 
one-half cupful each of candied lemon and orange peel. Moisten with 
unfermented grape juice, sweet cider, peach or plum syrup. The syrup 
from sweet pickles is a great improvement. Pack solid in airtight jars. 

Green Tomato Mincemeat. Chop tine four quarts of green tomatoes, 
drain off all juice, cover with cold water, let come lo a boil and scald 
for 30 minutes, then drain well. Add two pounds of brown sugar, one 
pound of seeded raisins, one- half pound of chopped citron, one largd 
half cupful of finely-chopped suet, one tablespoonful of salt and one-half 
cupful of strong cider vinegar. Stir well together and cook till thick.

sistency as pumpkin, and bake just like it. 

Peach Turnovers. — One pint of dried peaches stewed and sweetened 
with two tablespoonfuls of brown sugar; flavor with nutmeg to taste. 



48 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Make a stiff crust, not as short as for other pies. Roll out pieces the 
size of a saucer. Cover one-half of the crust one-half inch deep with 
the steweil fruit. Fold over, pinch the edges together and prick with a 
silver fork. Fry like doughnuts, preferably in cooking oil; powder with 
sugar and serve with maple syrup. 

Pear PiifTs.— Feel good pears, cut out the blossom end, but leave th< 
stem; simmer the pears until tender in a weak syrup flavored with 
lemon, then drain, and allow them to cooL Make a good, rich pie crust, 
roll out thin, cut into triangular pieces, and cover each pear, pinchiog the 
crust neatly together, but leaving the stem protruding. Bake in a quick 
oven to a pale brovra, and serve hot or cold. 

Prune Pie,— Stew half pound of prunes as for sauce. When qnite soft 
remove the stones, sweeten, beat up and gradually fold in the whites of 
two eggs. Line deep pie tins with crust and bake twenty minutes. Then 
turn in the prune mixture; spread. smoothly on top and pour over this 
a layer of well-sweetened and well-flavored apple sauce. Place in oven 
and bake twenty minutes longer. Eat hot or cold. 

Prune Pie No. S. — One cupful of stewed and stoned prunes, chopped 
fine; three tablespoonfuls of the syrup in which they were stewed, two 
eggs, yolks and white beaten separately, the whites to a stiff froth; sugar, 
salt and flavoring to taste. The prunes should be soaked an hour or two 
in warm water before stewing, then cooked slowly several hours, putting 
them on with cold water enough nearly to cover them and enough sugar 
to make a rich syrup. Bake without upper crust 

Prune Pie No. 3,— Cover a pie tin with rich crust, and then half fill 
with a layer of stewed prunes and their juice, the stones having been 
removed. Over the prunes pour a custard, made by beating up one egg 
and a teacupful of milk, a little nutmeg being grated over the top. The 
pie is baked until the custard is set. Little patty pans lined with pie crust 
and filled with the same material, are prune fanchonettes. 

Pumpkin Pie. — This recipe dilifers decidedly from those ordinarily used 
and is very good. Cut the pumpkin without paring, bake it, skin side 
down, until tender, and then scoop out the pulp and sift it. For one 
pie allow V/i cupful of pumpkin, one cupful of boiling milk, one teaspoon- 
fu! of butter, half a cupful of sugar, half a teaspoonful of salt, one- 
quarter teaspoonful of cinnamon, same amount of ginger; add one egg, 
beaten separately, Half bake (he crust, fill with the pumpkin and bake. 

Pumpkin Pie Without Eggs. — Let the pumpkin be of the pie variety, 
small, close-grained, and sweet. Steam it until tender, then press throi^h 
a colander. To a pint of sifted pumpkin add one quart of rich milk, two 
level tablespoonfuls flour, one cupful sugar, two teaspoonfuls ginger and a 
pinch of salt This is sufBcient for two pies. Fill the crusts, sift on a 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 49 

Kttle sugar and a dust of nutmeg, and bake. If the pumpkin is not up to 
the standard, one egg may be added, but not as a substitute for the flour, 
which gives body and smoothness to the filling. 

Raisin Pie.— One cupful of nice raisins; wash quickly, cover with 
boiling water, cook until tender; remove seeds; moisten a cupful of bread 
crumbs with the water, add one-fourth cupful of sugar, one egg (beaten), 
one tablespoonful lemon juice and the raisins, cut in two or three pieces 
each ; an upper and lower crust of tender pastry and a satisfactory bake 
make a most delicious pie. 

Raisin Pie No. 3.— Boil one pound of seeded raisins in sufficient water 
to cover for one hour. Then add the juice and grated rind of one lemon, 
a piece of butter the size of an egg, one cupful of sugar, and two table- 
spoonfuls of cornstarch. Bake in two crusts. This makes filling for two 
pies. A second way of making a pie is to cook one cupful of raisins in 
one cupful of water until they are softened, add the grated rind and juice 
of one lemon, half a cupful of sugar, a sifting of cinnamon and sufficient 
powdered cracker crumbs to thicken. Bake in two crusts. 

Raisin Turnovers,— One cupful of seeded raisins, the rind of a lemon, 
or a few pieces of candied lemon or orange peel, and a small piece of 
preserved citron, chop all together finely, stir into this one beaten egg, 
and the juice of one lemon. Roll out puff paste thinly, and cut it in 
circles, lay them on a plate, till with the mixture, then cover and press 
the edges firmly together. Bake the same length of time as you would 
a pie. 

Raspberry Cream Tart. — Line a pie plate with good paste, and fill with 
ted raspberries, sweetened with powdered sugar. Cover with paste, but 
do not pinch it down at the edges. When it is done, lift the top crust, 
which is thicker than usual, and pour upon the fruit a cream made as 
follows: One small cup of rich milk, heated to boiling point; whites of 
two eggs beaten light and stirred into the boiling milk; one tablespoonful 
of. white sugar; one-half teaspoonful of cornstarch wetted with cold 
milk. Boil three minutes, (hen let the cream get perfectly cold. Remove 
the top crust, pour the cream over the fruit, replace the crust, and set 
the pie away to cool. This recipe is given by Marion Harland; our home 
recipe for fruit cream pic calls (or a simple custard, usins: both white and 
yolk of one egg, which is poured'over the fruit as above. Strawberry 
cream pie is made in the same way. 

Rhubarb Pie.— Cut in rather coarse pieces enough rhubarb to fill a 
large cup. Beat one egg thoroughly, adding a good pinch of salt, add 
the rhubarb, one cup of sugar and two soda crackers rolled fine. Mix 
thoroughly, thei) turn into a pie tin lined with pastry. Put a few bits of

tart pie, bands of pastry laid over the top before baldng. Thb quantitj 
niakes one pie — a small deep one, or a thin large one. 

Rhubarb Cream Pie. — One cupful of rhubarb choired fine or grated, 
one cupful of sugar, a pinch of salt, a grating of nutmeg'or lemon peel, 
(loisten a tablespoonful of cornstarch with a tablespoonful of cold water; 
then fill the cup up with boiling water, stirring until dear. Beat the 
yolks of three eggs until light, and add them with the cornstarch to the 
other materials. Line a pie plate with good light paste, fill with the 
mixture and bake in a moderately hot oven until custard is set. When 
done and cooled, cover with a meringue made with the whites of the 
eggs and half a cupful of confectioner's sugar. Brown delicately in 
the oven. 

Fresh Strawberry Pie.— Bake an empty bottom crust, making it extra 
nice ; prick ho1e» all over the bottom and sides, to prevent its getting 
out of shape. As soon as baked sprinkle (he inside with sugar and fill 
with ripe berries; also well dredge with sugar.- Cover with sweetened 
whipped cream and then cover all with a meringue of the frothed whites 
of two eggs mixed with two tablespoon fu Is of sugar and a dash of 
lemon juice. Invert a plate in the oven and place the pie plate on top 
of it and brown. If the work is very carefully done the berries will not 
be even heated, and the result will be delicious. The pie should be 
thoroughly chilled before serving. 

Strawberry Pie No. 2. — Line a pie tin with rich crust shortened with 
butter, no baking powder being used. Let it cool, then fill with fresh 
strawberries, hulled and washed, and mixed With sugar. Cover with 
whipped cream and serve. 

Strawberry Pie No. 3.^Line a pie plate with good short crust, fill 
with ripe whole "berries, liberally sugared, and then cover with a lattice 
formed of criss-cross strips of crust. By the time the crust is browned 
the berries are cooked in their own rich juice, and the pie is much 
nicer than with an ordinary double crust. 

Strawberry Cream Pie.— After picking over the berries carefully, 
arrange them in layers in a deep pie plate, sprinkling sugar thickly 
between each layer, having hrst lined the dish with your best pastry. 
Cover with a crust with a slit in the top and bake. When the pie is 
baked, pour into the slit in the top ot the pie the following cream mix- 
ture: Take a small cupful of rich cream, heat until nearly boiling, then 
stir into it the whites of two eggs beaten lightly to a froth, also a table- 
spoonful of granulated or powdered sugar; boil all together a few 
moments. When cool, pour it into the pie through the slit in the cnist 
Serve with powdered sugar sifted on top.

CHAPTER V. 

PVDDINGS, HOT AND COLD. 

Tbe proof of tbe podding Is not In the eatlog, 

Never mlad what Ibe old saylnsB state ; 
The compliment ietting the cook's heart a'beatlag 
. I8 the call tor a big second plate. 

As a rule farm housekeepers are admirably situated for maJcing . 
delicious puddings, many of which are more wholesome than pastiy. 
The recipes given below include considerable variety, and will be found 
suggestive, as many may be altered to suit material on hand. We were 
obliged to omit a number of good ones, owing to lack of space. 

Apricot Pudding. — This may be made from evaporated apricots, care- 
fully soaked and stewed, instead of the canned fruit. Butter . a shallow 
pudding dish and sprinkle on the surface a layer of soft bread crumbs. 
Drain the syrup from a can of apricots and arrange a layer of fruit in 
the dish. Fill the cavities with sugar and a dot of butter the size of a 
pea on each. Cover each piece of fruit with another half to simulate the 
whole fruit, then fill the interstices with soft bread crumbs. Mix one pint 
of milk, the yolks of three eggs, well beaten, with one-quarter teaspoon 
of salt and three teaspoonfuls sugar, and pour this over the fruit. Lift 
the fruit a little so the rdstard may reach every part of the bread. Bake 
it about half an hour. Beat the whites of the egKs till stiff; add three 
heaped tablespoon fa Is of powdered sugar and three teaspoonfuls of 
lemon juice. When the pudding is done and cooked somewhat spread 
the meringue over the top and brown it slightly. Serve hot without sauce. 

Batter Pudding. — This is an old-fashioned recipe, which can be ' 
depended upon. Measure 12 tables poonfuls of flour after sifting; then 
sift again with a teaspoonful of baking powder and a small one of salt 
Beat four ^gs, without separating, until very light and before mixing 
them to a batter with a quart of milk, butter a three-pint oval baking 
dish and see that the oven is of a steady heat, as if for baking bread. 
Now make a smooth batter with the milk and flour, stirring in the eggs 
last, and bake about one hour. The pudding will rise with a brown crust 
on top, and, by the slow baking, the sides and bottom will also be crisp 
and brown, while the interior will be tender and light. Serve directly 
from the oven, with fruit juice slightly thickened for sauce. No other 
sauce will take the place of this. When the supply of extra juice canned 
for this very purpose is exhausted, evaporated cherries soaked over night 
and well simmered in the same water is an excellent substitute. 



SI THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Black Pudding.— One colleecup black molasses, one coSeecup sour 
creani; add one dessertspoon of soda and beat hard and then add one 
cup chopped suet, one cup seeded raisins, a few almonds (about a table- 
spoonful), do not blanch them, as they will have a. better flavor, three 
(or more if liked) chopped figs, two apples, and a piece of citron 
chopped. Three cups of flour, one-half teaspoonful of salt and the grat- 
ing of onc'half nutmeg. Beat well. Take four bakit^ powder cans 
(pound size), rub with melted butter and pour the batter into them and 
steam hard three hours. Stand in oven ten or fifteen minutes to dry off. 
When you wish to use steam half an hour. A quantity may be made at 
one time, as these puddings will keep six months. 

Blackberry Pudding.— Beat one-third of a cup of butter to a cream. 
Add gradually half a cup of sugar and the beaten yolks of two ^gs. 
Sift together two cups of previously sifted flour, four level teaspoonftila 
of baking powder and half a teaspoonful of salt Add this to the 
creamed butter, sugar, and eggs. Put in half of the flour mixture, mix, 
and then put in half a cupful of cold water. Mix in the rest of the 
flour, etc. Beat thoroughly and last of alt fold in the well-beaten white* 
of the two eggs. Sprinkle a cupful of blackberries with a little flour 
and add them to the batter as it is dropped a spoonful at a time, into the 
mold, which should be rubbed with unsalted butter. Steam an hour and 
a half, or bake twenty-five minutes, and serve with a blackbeuy hard 
sauce. The sauce is made in the usual way, with half a cup of butter 
and a cup of sugar. Add to this half a cupful of crushed berries. 

Blueberry Betty. — Put a pint of milk in a double boiler and put on 
the fire to scald. Pick over, wash and drain a pint of fresh blueberries. 
Have ready a pint of soft whole wheat bread crumbs. Put a layer of 
crumbs in a buttered pudding dish, then a layer of berries, then more 
' crumbs and so on until the dish is full, having crumbs on top. Stir two 
tablespoon (u Is of sugar in the milk, and when hot pour it over the con* 
tents of the dish. Cover and set in the oven to bake for about an. hour. 
Stand the pudding dish in a basin of hot water. Serve with a tart sauce. 

Blueberry Pudding.— Beat lyi cupful sugar with four eggs, add one 
pint milk and one cupful flour, in which sift one tablespoonful baking 
powder, one-half teaspoonful salt; add one cupful whole blueberries; pour

come a little more than half way up to the mold ; weight down and boil 
continuously for one hour; slip on to a dish and cover with sauce, then 
sprinkle over uncooked fruit. Sauce — Beat one cupful granulated sugar 
with one cupful butter to a cream; then add yolks of two eggs, one- 
quarter teaspoonful vanilla.

Steamed Blueberry Puffs. — Beat two eg^s until light and thick, with- 
out separating; add half a cupful of sugar and half a cupful of milk; 
stft together three level teaspoonfuls of baking powder, half a teaspoon- 
ful of salt and two cupfuls of flour, stir into the liquid ingredients ; then 
itir in one cup of blueberries. Turn into buttered cups and steam half 
an hour. The batter should drop easily from the end of the spoon. 
Serve hot with cream and sugar. 

Bread and Butter Pudding. — Strew half a cupful of currants in. the 
bottom of a baking dish, then butter some slices of freshly-baked bread 
and lay in the dish. Make a custard with two eggs and a pint of milk, 
sweeten to taste, and pour it over; grate a little nutmeg over the top and 
bake a light brown. This pudding should be baked in the dish in which 
it is to be sent to table. It is delicious eaten with stewed fruit' 

Steamed Bread and Butter Pudding. — Butter a small pudding bowl. 
Cut some thin bread and butter, decorate the bottom of the basin with 
candied peel cut in stars, or a few raisins or preserved cherries; put in 
the slices of bread and butter, dusting each slice with sugar and sprinkling 
with a few chopped preserved cherries. When full beat up an egg with 
half a piiit of milk, flavor with essence of almonds, and strain over the 
pudding. Leave to soak for a while, cover with buttered paper, and 
steam for an hour and a quarter. Turn out, and serve with custard. 

Bread Pudding in Disguise .^Break half a loaf of bread into pieces 
and soak in milk, just what the brea.d will take up. Then add an egg 
and a cup of sugar and a cup of rich, creamy milk in which put half 
leaspoonful of saleratus and teaspoonful of cream of tartar. Bake until 
light and well browned in a medium oven. To serve pour a little maple 
syrup over each dish.

a deep pudding dish, put in a layer of crumbs, then sliced apples and 
sprinkle with sugar, then another layer of crumbs, apples and sugar and 
continue until the materials are used with a thick layer of crumbs on the 
top. Bake about an hour in a moderate oven. If the oven browns on 
the bottom set in a pan of hot water or bake on the top grale of the oven, 
covering the pudding well to prevent too crisp an upper crust. Serve 
with hard sauce made as follows: Cream a third of a cupful of butter, 
add gradually a cupful of powdered sugar and when beaten to a cream 
■dd drop by drop to prevent separation, two tablespoonfuls of rich cream. 
Kavor with vanilla or lemon juice.

Carrot Pudding- — Mix together one cupfal of grated bread crumbs, 
a quarter of a pound each of flour and of butter, one-balf pound of 

preserved cherries, and one-half pound of sugar and a saltspoonful of 
salt. Boil six young carrots until they are tender, then pass them 
through a sieve and add half a pound of this pulp to the other ingredi- 
enls. Stir the mixture well, then steam it in a buttered mold for 2J^ 
hours. In the Winter we make an imitation plum pudding in which a 
cupful of grated carrot is used, the carrot both lightening and 
enriching it. 

Cherry Cups,— Measure a pint of sifted flour, add two teaspoonfuts 
of baking powder and half a Icaspoonfui of salt and sift again. Mix to 
a soft dough with cold water. Butter little custard cups and drop in a 
little of the dough and then add a teaspoonful of the cherries; cover 
these with more dough (the cups should not be more than half full). 
Set the cups in a steamer, or if you have no steamer you can put them 
in a dtfep baking pan with a little boiling water; cover closely with 
another pan and steam half an hour in the oven. Eat with cherry sauce 
or sweetened cream. On bread baking day you can make these with 
bread dough instead of the hairing powder dough. 

Cherry Batter Pudding. — Prepare a cupful of stoned cherries. Beat 
two eggs separately, add half a pint of milk, or better still, sweet cream, 
to the yolks, and to this one tablespoonful of melted butter. Have ready 
1)4 cupful of flour, into which two teaspoonfuts of baking powder have 
been sifted, with a dash of salt. Add this to the yolks of the eggs and 
milk, and lastly add the whites of the eggs, beaten light. Beat vigor- 
ously for a few minutes and turn into a greased baking pan, allowing the 
batter to be about an inch thick. Cover it with the cherries, add one-third 
of a cup of granulated sugar, sprinkled lightly on the top, and bake in a 
quick oven for 30 minutes. Serve hot with hard sauce or a sauce made 
from a cup of cherries and half a cup of sugar stewed together until the 
cherries are reduced to a pulp. Sauce as well as pudding should be 
served hot. 

Boiled Cherry Pudding. — Beat three eggs light without separating; add 
a pint of milk. Sift two teaspoonfuls of baking powder and a half a 
teaspoonful of salt in a little less than a quart of sifted flour and add the 
liquid gradually to the flour, stirring to a smooth batter. Add a teaspoon- 
ful of melted butter. Beat thoroughly and then stir in a pint of cherries, 
stoned and drained free from juice and well floured. Turn into a well- 
buttered pudding dish or mold, or an old-fashioned pudding bag, scalded 
and floured, and cook in a kettle of boiling water for three hours. Keep 
the water boiling continually or the pudding will be heavy. If cooked 
in a mold or dish, the water must not be deep enough to boil over the 
pudding. If in a bag, there must be sufficient water to keep the pudding

from touching the bottom of the kettle. Serve with hard or foamy sauce. 

Cherry Pudding in Winter. — Nearly fill a buttered baking dish with 
Ihe sour canned cherries. Use just enough of the juice so the cherries 
will be moist. Spread over this a dough made from one-fourth teacupful 
sugar, one tablespoonful butter, one-half cupful milk, one egg, a little 
salt, one cupful flour (use a little more if necessary to make dougb like 
cake), one teaspoonful baking powder. Bake half an Hour. Sauce to 
serve with it is made as follows: One-half cupful butter, one-half cupful 
sugar, one tablespoonful of flour or cornstarch. Mix thoroughly. To this 
add a pint of the cherry juice. Boll till it thickens, 

Canned Cherry Tapioca. — Cover a scant cupful of tapioca with cold 
water and let it soak over night. In the morning place over the fire with 
a saltspoonful of salt and a pint of boiling water ; simmer slowly until 
the tapioca is perfectly clear. Stir a pint of stoned cherries into the 
boiling tapioca; add a cupful of sugar (more if the cherries are very 
sour) ; turn into a serving dish and set away to cool. Serve with

scant saltspoonful of salt and a teaspoonful of vanilla. Add the milk 
and breadcrumbs and then, wlien well mixed, turn the whole into a pud- 
ding dish that has been buttered and sugared. Bake it one hour in a 
moderately hot oven. Serve cold, with cream. This pudding can be 
baked in individual molds if preferred. 

Steamed Chocolate Pudding. — Boil one quart of fresh milk and pour

crumbs, milk and lemon rind added by degrees. This is poured into a 
buttered dish, the citron dropped in and a piece of butter placed over 
all. The baking required half an hour and the preparation when cold 
is covered with a meringue made of four whites, a cup of powdered 
sugar and the juice of a lemon. This is browned slightly before serving. 

Cocoanut Pudding.— One-half cupful of cocoanut, one-half cupful of 
bread crumbs, one pint of milk, one egg, one tablespoonful of butter, 
two tablespoon fuls of sugar and one level saltspoonful of salt. Soak 
the bread crumbs and cocoanut in the milk for three hours; mash the 
bread fine, and add the sugar, salt and melted butler. Beat the white 
and yolk of the egg separately, and add first the yolk and then the white, 
stirring well. Place all in a well-buttered pudding dish and bake half 
an hour. Serve hot without sauce. 

Coffee Pudding,— Boil three-fourths of a cup of ground coffee in 
one quart water 10 minutes ; then add one-half ounce gelatine which 
had been soaked IS minutes; then add one cup sugar; boil one minute; 
then strain throtigh a cloth, set aside to get cold; when almost jellied 
beat one-half pint cream till near stiff, then add the coffee jelly, gradu- 
ally beating all the time. When all is well mixed flavor with vanilla, 
and set in a cold place to hard«-n. It can be served alone, or with cream. 
The recipe is enough for six people. 

Colonial Pudding, — When baking bread put a piece of the dough into 
a pound baking powder tin and bake this for the top of the pudding. 
Soak some slices of Boston brown bread in scalded milk for two hours. 
Then beat up well, add a cupful of raisins, a little chopped mixed peel, 
half a teaspoonful of mixed spice, half a cupful of sugar, and two ounces 
of beef suet, chopped very fine, or a piece of butter the size of an egg. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 57 

Mix all well together, adding cold milk as you mix it, and then put into 
a buttered baking dish. A lound, shallow dish is the best to use, and 
it should also be one that cait be sent to Ihe table. Now cut the white 
bread into slices, butter them, and lay them closely together on the top 
of the pudding mixture. Grate a Httle nutmeg over all, and balce in a 
moderate oven for an hour and a ha]f, covering it for an hour and 
taking off the cover for the half hour so that it may be a nice light brown. 

Cottage Pudding. — One cup sugar, two eggs, one pint sweet milk, two 
scant teaspoons baking powder, flavoring and flour to make ji batter as 
stiff as cake dough. Bake three-quarters of an hour in a moderate 
oven and serve with milk or hot sauce. To make hot sauce cream 
together one tablespoon butter and two of flour with half cup of sugar. 
Slowly add enough boiling water to make it thin and smooth. Then 
proceed to add boiling water to make it the consistency of thin starch. 
Boil a few nunutes and flavor before serving. 

Steamed Cranberry Dumplings. — Make the dumplings of good, pre- 
pared flour, which cannot fail to be light, using one pint of it; add a 
pinch of salt and mix with milk to a paste just stiff enough to drop by 
tablespoonfuls on the buttered steamer bottom ; steam over boiling water 
about half an hour. Serve immediately; first carefully split the fluffy 
rolls open, lightly butter and put between a tablespoonful of stewed cran- 
berry sauce (warm); pour over a foamy sauce made as fallows: Three 
tablespoonfuls of milk, stirred into one beaten egg, a half cupful of sugar 
and one teaspoonful of flour; beat hard and put into double boiler; pour 
on slowly a cup of boiling water, stir constantly until the sauce thickens, 
then add one teaspoonful of butter and one of strawberry flavoring. 

Cranberry Pot-pie.— Butter a porcelain stewpan or keitle; put in a 
pint of berries, sprinkled with one cupful sugar; make a pint of biscuit 
dough, shape into a lai^e ring and lay on the fruit in the kettle; then 
pour another pint of berries into and around the cup of dough, adding 
another cupful of sugar; pour one pint of boiling water into the center, 
cover closely and stew steadily for 20 minutes. When done turn from 
the kettle on to a platter; serve with cream and sugar. 

Cranberry Pudding. — Sift and measure one pint of flour; add two 
teaspoonfuls baking powder and half a teaspoonful of salt. Sift again 
until all are thoroughly blended. Add enough sweet milk to make a 
soft batter. Stir in one cup of cranberries that have been coarsely 
chopped. Pour into a pudding bag or a porcelain-lined mold. If the bag 
is used boil one and one-half hour in plenty of water. If the mold is used, 
steam the pudding two hours. 

Baked Cranberry Pudding. — Put a layer of coarsely crumbled bread iii 
bottom of buttered dish; then a layer of seeded raisins and stewed cran- 
berriu, i few bits of butter, and a few drops of vanilla extract; repeat 



SS THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

bread, butter, vanilla and fruit until dish is fall; have crumbs and but- 
ter top layer; bake until puffy and brown; then decorate with meringue 
and place in very moderate oven to set the latter, but not brown. 

Cream Curds, — Beat four eggs and stir them into a quart of millc 
slightly warmed. New milk was originally called for. Add a little salt 
and turn the minture into a covered earthen pot. A bean pot or cas- 
serole will answer. Set the pot in a pan of warm water over the fire. 
Aa soon as the milk cracks turn it carefully out on a sieve covered with 
a linen clofh. When the draining is complete put the curds in a glass 
dish in large spoonfuls. 

Cup Custards. — In making cup custards, it is a pleasant change to 
put in each cup, before the custard is poured in, a tablespoonful of 
either strawberry or raspberry jam. The custard cups should be stood 
in a. baking pan containing hot water while hakiag; every cnstard should 
be cooked in this way. A date custard is made and baked in the ordi- 
nary manner; then, after baking, the top is covered with stoned dates, 
which may be filled with nuts if desired, and rolled in powdered sugar. 
The dates are covered with a meringue, which is browned in the oven, 
and the custard is then served cold. . 

Peach Custard. — Slice ripe peaches in a glass dish and sugar them 
well two hours before they are to be served. Make a boiled custard by 
taking three eggs, one and one-half pints sweet milk and one tablespoon 
corn starch and one cup of sugar. Boil after thoroughly beating together 
in a double boiler till thick and smooth. Pour over peaches and serve 
white slightly warm. 

Date Puffs. — Two eggs, one cupful of sugar, one quarter of a cupfnl 
of butter, the same of milk, one teaspoonful of baking powder and jour 
enough to make a thin batter. Stir in one cupful of stoned dates; fill 
muffin cups half full and steam 30 minutes. Serve with a liquid sauce 
or with sweetened cream. 

Economy Pudding.— Take two cupfuls of ginger cookie crumba 
(crumbled cookies) and one cupful sweet milk, one cupful molasses, one 
teaspoonful cinnamon, one- fourth teaspoonful doves, one-fourth tea- 
spoonful nutmeg, three eggs weH beaten, one-half teaspoonful salt, one 
cup seeded raisins, one-half teaspoonful of soda dissolved in one table- 
spoonful of water and two cupfuls of flour. Beat thoroughly, turn into 
greased pudding pan and steam three hours. Serve with bard sauce. 

Farina Pudding. — Place a double boiler with one pint of milk over 
the fire; when it boils, sprinkle in two and a half tablespoon fals farina, 
one-quarter teaspoonful salt and two tablespoon fuls sugar. Cook 
twenty minutes, then add the beaten whites of two eggs, stir for a few 
minutes, remove from fire, pour into a mold and set aside to cooL 
Serve with orange sauce made in following manner: Stir the yoOcs of 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. SO 

two eggs with half cupful sugar to a cream, add half cupful orange 
juice and one tablespoonful lemon juice, add last the beaten white of one 
c^ and serve. Or a vanilla sauce may be served with the puddit^. 

Fruit Puffs. — Fill old cups or baking cans to the depth of two inches 
with strawberries, sliced apples, or any kind of berries and cover with a 
layer of si^ar. Put in each cup a small lump of butter and completely 
cover the berries with a batter made of one e^, one pint sweet milk, 
one and one-half teaspoon baking powder and flour to make rather stiffer 
than for pancakes. Bake 40 minutes in a steady oven. 

Gingerbread Pudding. — One cupful of molasses, one cupful of sugar, 
one-hatf cupful of melted lard or butter, salt ; all kinds of spice — one- 
fourth teaspoonful of each — one cupful of buttermilk, two scant tea- 
spoonfuls of soda, one cupful of raisins or sliced apples, flour for stiff 
batter. Steam in a covered pudding dish two hours. Hot water may 
be substituted for buttermilk; then use half the quantity of soda. 
Whipped cream is better than sugar with this. 

Gooseberry Charlotte,— Stew a pint of ripe or nearly ripe gooseberries 
for 10 minutes very slowly, not to break them. Cut six or eight slices 
of stale plain cake; line the bottom of your pudding dish with them; 
put next a layer of the gooseberries sprinkled thickly with sugar; more 
cake, more berries, and so on until the dish is full. Cover closely and 
steam in a moderate oven 20 or 25 minutes. You will find the juice of 
the berries sufficient moisture. Serve hot with a good pudding sauce. 

Gooseberry Fool, — According to the original English recipe it was 
merely gooseberry sauce enriched with cream ; American authorities, how- 
ever, use eggs and butter instead of cream. To make it English fashion, 
stew either green or ripe gooseberries, after topping and stemming them, 
until tender, in just enough water to prevent burning, strain through a 
sieve, sweeten and then stir in as much rich cream as taste dictates ; 
pour into a glass dish, and si-t away in a cool place, A very delicious 
dessert is made by using this gooseberry fool as filling for charlottes, 
lining either one large mold c-r small individual cups with ladies' fingers 
or small slices of sponge cake, and then filling with the gooseberry mix- 
ture, putting whipped cream on the top. The American recipe adds to 
one quart of ripe gooseberries, stewed and strained, the yolks of four 
eggs, one cupful of sugar, and one tablespoonful of butter, beaten to- 
gether until light. Pour into a glass dish, and heap on top the whites 
of the eggs, beaten with two table spoonfuls of powdered sugar. 

Gooseberry Pudding. — Green gooseberries mixed with rhubarb make 
a nice combination for pie or puddings. Of course plenty of sugar is 
needed. For gooseberry pudding line a mold with baking powder or suet 
crust (preferably the latter), fill with gooseberries alone or mixed with 
rhubarb sugar liberally, add a little water, and cover; steam three hours.

a cupful of sugar and the stiffly beaten white of an egg and lemon to 
flavor. 

Graham Date Pudding. — Stone a cupful of dates and add them to a 
pint of boiling water, two lablespoonfuls of sugar and a pinch of salt.

until it begins to stiffen, then fold in the stiflly beaten whites of two 
eggs. Run into a mold. When ready to serve unmold and garnish with 
whipped cream. A bunch of grapes may be placed on the top of the 
mold. This will serve eight persons. 

Grape Pudding No. 2. — This is an old- fashioned dish which may be 
either boiled or baked. Delaware grapes are best for it Wash, pick 
and flour well before putting into the batter. A heaping pint of picked 
grapes makes a fair-sized pudding. For the batter beat four eggs very 
light, whites and yolks separate, mix smoothly with the yolks half a 
pint of milk and one pint of flour sifted twice. Add half a cupful of 
butter beaten to a cream, and last of all the whites of eggs, stirring them 
in with long, swift strokes, all the same way. The grapes go in at the 
very last, and the bag or the pan ought to be ready before they are 
added. Boil the pudding three hours, and serve with a rich grape juice 
sauce. For a baked pudding the white of one egg may be kept out, and 
used for a meringue. Serve with the same sauce. 

Huckleberry Blanc Mange.— Heat one quart of milk in a double boiler 
(reserving one-third of a cupful with which to mix three tablespoonful; 
of cornstarch). Add one-half cupful of sugar and a pinch of salt. 
When the milk is scalding hot, stir in the cornstarch, and cook for five 
minutes. Pour this on the well-beaten whites of two eggs and beat 
thoroughly. When cool pour a little of it into a wetted mold, strew 
over this fresh blueberries, then another portion of the blanc mange, 
then more of the blueberries (using > pint in all), finish with the blanc

grant, rich, golden, trembling in its sweet jellied whey. Now add the 
last touch. When you serve it, put a heaping spoonful of nice apple 
sauce flavored with nutmeg over the top, and if you like another spoon- 
ful of whipped cream over that.

whites. Dip your bag in hot water, flour it and fill half full with the 
mixture, as it will swell very much. Boil five hours. Eat very hot, 
with butter and sugar. This pudding is even better when baked in a 
well-buttered dish for an hour and a half. Bake, covered, for an hour 
and a quarter, then brown.

of one white of egg and two tablespoons of sugar and then slightly 
brown in the oven. 

Maple Custard. — Scald one pint of rich milk in a double boiler and 
when hot add a tablespoonful of cornstarch mixed with one-third of a 
cupful of cold milk. Just before taking from the fire add two table- 
spoonfuls of fine-shaved maple sugar and the beaten yolks of three eggs. 
Stir until smooth, adding when cool a pinch of salt and half a tea-

you mix a pirt of flour into a biscuit dough according to well-known 
directions; make a very soft dough; pat into shape with the hands and 
cover the pears. Bake about 35 minutes. There should be rich juice 
enough to moisten the crust. If preferred it may have plain cream 
served with it.

one-half pound chopped candied peel. Mix alt the dry ingredients; then 
beat the eggs, add the milk to them, pour over the other materials, and 
mix well; it wilF require very hard stirring, as it is stiff. Put. in 
greased molds holding one quart each, cover with well-floured cloth, and 
boil for six hours. Store away, and when used boil for six hours more. 

Plum Pudding,— Fill a deep baking pan to the depth of two inches 
with seeded plums, well sugared. Dot with bits of butter and put over 
the top a thick, good light biscuit crust with holes for the steam to 
escape. Bake 40 minutes and serve with the juice frorn^ canned plums 
or cream. This is good pudding when canning is going on to nse up 
the surplus juice. Seeded grapes, peaches, apples or cherries may be 
nsed instead of plums.

e-fourth of a. cup of chopped citron and half a teaspoonful of 
roll ttp and steam for 40 minutes ; serve hot, with hard sauce. 

Poor Man's Pudding. — One cupful sour milk, one cupful of mo- 
lasses, one cupful of cold water, two cupfuls Indian meal, half a cup of 
butter, one egg, one teaspoonful of soda, one teaspoonful of cinnamon, 
one saltspoonful of salt. Beat all together thoroughly. Pour into a 
greased pudding pan and bake two hours in a moderately hot oven.

raisins well floured and three level teaspoonfuls of baking powder ; turn 
into a greased mold and boil three hours; serve with hard sauce. 

Prune Sago. — After washing one-half pound of prunes put them to 
soak till well puffed out, then put them into a stewpan with enough cold 
water to cover them. Cook till soft ; pass the fruit through a fine sieve, 
after stoning it. Mix with it some pearl sago that has been well boiled. 
There should be equal quantities of fruit pulp and sago. Heat up, but 
do not boii ; if too stiff thin with a little milk or water, season with 
lemon juice ; it will be sweet enough for ordinary palates. Pour into a 
jelly mold and when cold turn on a glass dish. Serve with whipped 
cream or boiled custard. 

Pumpkin Custard.^ — One quart of hot milk, a large cup of strained 
squash or pumpkin, a teaspoonful of butter and one of salt, a cupful of 
sugar in which half a teaspoonful of cinnamon and a pinch of ginger 
have been mixed, and three eggs beaten light. Mix pumpkin and milk, 
add other ingredients, the eggs last, pour into custard cups which must 
be set in a pan of hot water. Bake until firm, about half an hour, testing 
with a knife Wade. If it comes out clean they are done. Serve ice-cold. 

Queen's Pudding. — Take about a quart of good, rich, sweet milk, and 
half a pint of bread crumbs, minus the crust. Milk and bread are scalded 
together, and cooled enough to work through the colander. In this 
way the bread is worked smooth, and is thoroughly mixed with the milk. 
To this mixture are added the yolks of four eggs and the whites of two, 
about two-thirds of a cup of sugar, and one spoonful of butter. Beat 
the ingredients together very thoroughly, for the success of the pudding 
depends much on the beating. Flavor with nutmeg. Bake it in a very 
moderately hot oven, like a custard pie, which should never come to a 
boil. When baked, beat the whites of two eggs to a stiff froth and add 
three or four spoonfuls of granulated sugar for the frosting. Spread a 
good layer of jelly upon the pudding, and over this spread the frosting, 
and set in the oven till it browns, which takes but a very few minutes 
if the oven is hot. To be eaten with cream and sugar.

Raisin Steamed Pudding. — Blend a piece of butter the size of an egg 
with one cupful of sugar, to tliis add one beaten egg, naif a cupful of 
milk, two teaspoonfuls of baking powder, sifted with two cupfuls of 
flour, and one cupful of seeded raisins dredged in flour. Fill cups par- 
tially full with the batter and steam three-quarters of an hour. Serve 
either with boiled sauce or sweetened cream. 

Baked Raspberry Pudding.— Line a small pudding dish with rich puff 
paste and piiek with a fork. Bake a light brown and set it aside until 
cold. Beat very light Che whites of four eggs, add slowly one cup of 
sugar, and lastly stir in a quart of red raspberries. Heap this lightly into 
the cooked shell in the pudding dish, return to the oven and bake 15 
to SO minutes. Have the oven just moderately hot. 

Boiled Raspberry Pudding. — Open a can of canned or preserved rasp- 
berries and drain off the liquor, saving it for sauce for the pudding. 
Make a rich biscuit dough ; roll this into a sheet a half inch thick, 
spread thickly with the berries, sprinkle bits of butter over these and 
roll up the sheet of dough as you would a sheet of music. Put into a 
floured cloth and boil for three hours. Add to the raspberry liquor a 
little sugar and boil up once. Take the pudding from the cloth, lay on 
a dish and pour the steaming sauce over it. 

Red Pudding.— A pint of red currants, a pint of raspberries, and a 
pint of cold water ; mix, and add sugar to tasle. Thus, if a rather sour 
pudding is desired, two teacuptuls of sugar will be sufficient to sweeten 
fliese ingredients, but if, on the other hand, it is a sweeter pudding that 
is required, the amount of sugar must be increased correspondingly. To 
this mixture add cinnamon — two sticks, each about three inches in length 
will be sufficient — already broken into bits, and when all these ingre- 
dients have boiled together for half an hour in a porcelain -lined stew- 
pan, press the juice through a sieve into another receptacle, and, adding 
a teacupful of blanched almonds and citron that have been chopped finely 
together, cook again for another 30 minutes. When nearly done, thicken 
with cornstarch. Set aside in a wet mold until it has had time to be- 
come hard; then serve it in slices covered thickly with rich cream. 

Rice Pudding. — Have one pint of rice boiled done and still hot. Into 
this stir one cup of raisins to swell and begin cooking in the hot mass. 
When nearly cold beat together three eggs, one quart of milk, one cup 
sugar and vanilla to taste. Add the rice and raisins, stirring till smooth 
and free from lumps. This pudding will have a delicious thick custard 
on top of the layer of rice if properly made and is better than the old 
style of nearly solid pudding. Bake one hour and serve with sweet milk. 

Lemon Rice Pudding. — Boil a cup of well washed rice in a quart of 
milk until very soft. Add to ii while hot the beaten yolks of three eggs, 
the juice and grated rind of two lemons, eight tablespoonfuls of sugar 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 67 

and a pinch of salt. If too thick, add a little milk. It should be rather 
thicker than boiled custard. Turn it into a pudding dish, beat the 
whites of the eggs very stiff with six tables poo nfuls of powdered sugar, 
spread over (he lop and brown delicately in a slow oven. 

Rhubarb Cobbler. — Fill a deep, buttered, earthenware pie dish with 
rhubarb cut into pieces an inch long. Make a batter of eggs, flour, milk 
and salt, allowing a large tablespoonful of flour to each egg and milk 
enough to make a batter thick as for fritter batter. Pour this over the 
rhubarb and bake until the pudding is light and nicely browned. 

Rhubarb Puffs, — One cupful of finely chopped rhubarb, one cupful 
of sugar, two tablespoon fuls of butter creamed with tlie sugar, add two 
well-beaten eggs, one-quarter of a cup of milk, flour with one teaspoonful 
of baking powder well mixed into it, to make a thick bailer. Fill well- 
greased cups half full and steam for half an hour. The sauce lo serve 
with these puffs is made by creaming together one-half cupful of pow- 
dered sugar and a small half cupful of butter, then add by degrees one 
whipped egg, beating until perfectly smooth. The last thing before serv- 
ing stir in three tablespoon fuls of boiling water. 

Boiled Rhubarb Pudding. — Make three cups of flour into dough as 
for baking powder biscuit, Roll one-fourth inch thick; cover with rhu- 
barb that has been cut in inch pieces and scalded. Wipe dry before 
spreading on the crust. Sprinkle liberally with sugar and add a dash 
of nutmeg if desired. Make a roll of the dough and cook in steamer, 
or tie up in floured cloth and drop in boiling water. Cook 30 to 45 
minutes ; serve with foamy sauce. 

Rhubarb Bread Pudding. — Peel the rhubarb and cut it into small 
pieces. Cover the bottom of a pudding dish with pieces of buttered 
bread. Over this put a layer of rhubarb. Pour over it a half-teaspoon- 
fnl of lemon juice, and cover liberally with sugar. Add another layer of 
bread and butter, rhubarb, lemon and sugar. Repeat until the dish is 
full, covering the last layer of rhubarb with well-bultered bread crumbs. 
Cover the dish, and steam for one hour. Then remove the lid and b.ake 
it slowly until it is nicely browned. 

Rhubarb Tapioca. — Prepare the rhubarb as for stewing; place in a 
deep baking dish and add sugar enough to sweeten well, a little shredded 
orange peel, salt and dot with bits of butter. Add one quart of water 
to half a cupful of fine, tapioca. Add a pinch of salt and cook in a 
double ttoiler for 15 minutes. Then pour over the rhubarb, cover the 
dish and bake half an hour. Serve with sweetened whipped cream. 

Sour Milk Pudding,— Soak four slices of stale bread in a little milk 
or water until soft. Then stir in a quart of rich, sour milk, a cupful 
of molasses, a tablespoonful of melted butter, a teaspoonful each of 
cloves and cinnamon, saltspoonful of salt. Bake slowly three hours. 



6fi THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Steamed Pudding. — One cupful molasses, one egg, one cupful hot 
water, one teaspoonful saleratus, one tablespoonful butter, one cupful 
raisins, stoned, a little salt, flour enough to make slifT as cake, sieam 
two hours. With this pudding use the following sauce which is de- 
licious: Cream until very light one cupful of brown sugar, and nearly 
cne-half cupful butter, a little salt, and one-fourth teaspoonful of va- 
nilla. Just before serving beat in the unbeaten white of one egg. 

Strawberry Dumplings. — They will require one egg, a cup of sweet 
milk, a tablespoonful of melted butter, a heaping teaspoonful of baking 
powder, and fiour enough to make a batter that will be a trifle thicker 
than that which is commonly used for griddle cakes. Pour a tittle of 
this batter into buttered tins, or porcelain cups; place a number of well- 
sweetened berries in the center and cover them with more batter ; then 
steam for about half an hour. Serve with a sauce made by mashing 
some strawberries and incorporatii^ them into an ordinary hard butter- 
and-sugar sauce. 

Strawberry Pudding. — One cup cleaned strawberries, place in an 
earthen bowl, set in steamer over a pot of cold water, place over the fire; 
while this is heating and coming to a boil make a batter of the follow- 
ing; One heaping cup of flour with two heaping teaspoonfuls of baking 
powder and one-half teaspoonful of salt; sift all together two or three 
times, then add sweet milk or water to make a soft batter that will drop 
easily from spoon. Lift the lid of steamer and drop quickly over the 
strawberries, covering them all over nicely. Steam for 40 minutes ; do 
not let the water stop boiling. This quantity makes enough pudding 
for four persons. Eat either with cream and sugar or a sauce made as 
follows: Break one egg in a dish, add one heaping tablespoonful of 
granulated sugar, beat light, then add dessertspoonful of flour and a 
pinch of salt; beat well again; then Add slowly boiling water until the 
sauce is of the required thickness (about like nice cream); flavor to 
taste. This sauce is very nice with any kind of pudding, especially cot- 
tage pudding. 

Sweet Potato Pudding. — One quart grated raw sweet potato, one 
quart milk, three eggs, two cupfuls sugar, piece of butter the size of an 
egg, one-half teaspoonful of salt, cinnamon and allspice to taste. Mix 
well, put in a buttered earthen pudding dish, and bake two hours in a 
moderate oven. 

Steamed Sweet Potato Pudding. — Take two cupfuls of grated raw 
potatoes, one cupful of grated carrots, two cupfuls of currants, one 
cupful of raisins stoned and_ chopped, one cupful of minced suet, one cup- 
ful of sugar, one teaspoonful each of salt and soda, and flour enough 
to make a stiff batter. Place in a greased mold and steam two hours- 
Serve with boiled sauce. i^ C_'iOO>'lc

Suet Pudding.— One cupful molasses, one cupful beef suet chopped 
fine, one cupful sour milk, one leaspoonful saleratus, one cupful stoned 
niisins, one-half tea^poonful salt, four cupfuls itour. Mix thoroughly. 
Put in a buttered basin in the steamer over a kettle of boiling water. 
Steam for four hours. Do not disturb while steaming; at least not for 
the first hour. 

French Tapioca Pudding. — Scald one pint of milk over hot water. 
Stir in one-third of a cup of a quick cooking tapioca, mixed with a 
few grains of salt and one-fourth a cup of sugar. Stir and cook about 
ten minutes, then add very gradually to three eggs (or two whole eggs 
and the whites of two more), beaten very light and thick. Also add a 
grating of lemon rind and a tabtespoonful of butler. Turn inlo a tur- 
ban-shaped mold, thoroughly buttered and dusted with sugar, and bake, 
standing in a pan of water, one hour. Serve cold, turned from the 
mold and surrounded with a fruit sauce. This is a rich, yet delicate 
pudding. 

Taylor Pudding. — Stir into a cup of sweet milk a level teaspoonful 
of soda and a teaspoonful of salt. Beat into the milk a cup of Porto 
Rican molasses and stir the wet ingredients slowly into two cups of well- 
sifted flour. Beat the batter well and pour it into a greased cake tin. 
U will be about the consistency of cake batter. Bake it in a hot oven 
for about thirty or forty minutes. When it is nearly done prepare a 
-liquid sauce, as follows : Put in a saucepan five tablespoon fuls of sugar 
and 10 tables poonfuls of water. Let it boil for four minutes and then 
add three level tablespoon fuls of butter and flavor well with nutmeg. 
When the pudding is done turn it out on a platter and carry it to the 
table. Serve it cut in thick slices with the liquid sauce. 

Yorkshire Pudding.— This is a batter pudding cooked where it will 
receive the drippings from the roasting meat, and it is very good; as 
originally made it was cooked in front of an open fire, where it would 
receive drippii^s from the meat cooking upon a spit. About an hour 
before the roast of beef is done drain off the gravy, leaving about two 
tablespoon fuls in the dripping pan. The meat should be laid upon a rack 
over the pan, so as to raise it up. The pudding requires three eggs, one 
pint of milk, six large tablespoonfuls of flour, one-half teaspoonful of 
salt, and two dashes of pepper. Beat the eggs until light, then add the 
milk. Put the flour into a bowl, moisten it gradually with the eggs and 
milk, beat until smooth ; strain it through a sieve to avoid lumps, add the 
pepper and salt, pour it into the dripping pan and bake. Cut into squares 
cr strips, and serve around the meat.

Cook and landlord down witb care. 

Since apples play a large part in farmhouse economy, it has been 
thought well to group recipes for their use together, rather than sepa 
rating them in various chapters. A few othei" apple recipes will l>e 
found, however, included among jellies and preserves, cakes and pastry. 

Baked Apples. — Pare and core cooking apples; put in a granite pan; 
put over them a cupful of sugai', butter the size of a walnut; cover; bake 
until almost done; take the cover oR and let them brown. When apples 
are baked in a covered earthen dish or casserole flavor and appearance 
are at their best. Fare and core the apples, sprinkle them with sugar 
and a little powdered clcves and cinnamon. Add a little water, cover the 
dish, and hake a long time in a slow oven. The apples cook to a deep 
red, and are very tender and rich in flavor. Honey is a desirable addi- ■ 
tion to baked apples. Wipe or peel the apples, and remove the core 
without running the knife clear through. Into this hollow put a bit of 
butter and a teaspoonfnl of honey, and bake after the ordinary manner. 

Baked Apples in Jelly. — Peel, core and quarter a quart of apples, add 
half a cupful of water and tliree- fourths cupful of sugar, put in a cov- 
ered earthen dish and cook three to four hours in a slow oven, when 
they should be dark red in color. Then mix with the apples a cupful 
of liquid lemon jelly, and set in a mold to harden. These baked apples 
are also very nice eaten warm without the jelly. 

Fancy Baked Apples. — Peel and core medium-sized tart apples. Put 
them in a baking dish and pour half a cup of water over them. Set in 
a hot oven, and when the apples are heated, sprinkle with enough sugar 
to coat each and bake until tender. Make a syrup of one cup of water, 
half a cup of sugar, the juice of half a lemon, and a teaspoonful of the 
grated rind. Add two tablespoon fuls of chopped raisins, two of chopped 
candied cherries, two of chopped candied pineapple, and two of chopped 
almonds, and when the sugar Is dissolved set at the back of the stove and 
let cook slowly for half an hour. When the apples are done put in little 
glass saucers, taking care not to break them. Fill with the cooked 
sweets and pour the syrup over them. Serve cold with whipped cream. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 71 

Boiled Apples in Syrup.—Rub the apples clean, but do not peel, and 
stick four cloves into each. Put in earthen dish, half cover with cold 
water, and add one cup of sugar to each pint of water. Place upon 
stove and cook until apple skins crack; remove apples, then boil down 
syrup until it is like jelly, and pour over the fruit. 

Apple Butter. — Apple butter should be made from new cider, fresh 
from the press, and not yet fermented. Fill a porcelain-lined kettle with 
cider and boil until reduced one-half. Then boil another kettleful in 
the same way, and so continue until you have sufficient quantity. To 
every four gallons of boiled eider allow a half-bushel of nice juicy 
apples, pared, cored and quartered. The cider should be boiled the day 
before you make the apple butter. Fill a very large kettle with the 
boiled cider and add as many apples as can be kept moist. Stir fre- 
quently, and when the apples are soft beat with a wooden stick until they 
arc reduced to a pulp. Cook and stir continuously until the consistency 
is that of soft marmalade and the color is a very dark brown. Have 
boiled cider at hand in case it becomes too thick, and apples if too thin. 
Twenty minutes before you take it from the fire add ground cinnamon, 
and nutmeg to taste. It requires no sugar. When cold, put into stone 
jars and cover closely. 

Apple Dumplings. — Pare, quarter and core tart apples. Put one table- 
spoonful of baking powder in one quart of Rour, add one cupful of lard 
and half a teaspoonful of salt and mix with sweet milk, make stilTer than 
for biscuits, roll and cut in squares and put around the pieces of apple. 
Into a deep pudding dish put one quart of water, one cupful of sugar 
and a small lump of butter. Set it on top of the stove and let it come 
to a boil. Then put in the dumplings and bake in a brisk oven one hour. 

Apple Dumplings with Bread Dough. — Take out about a pint of bread 
dough in the morning when il is ready to go in the baking pans, more 
or less according to the size of the family; add shortening half the size 
of an egg, mix through the dough and set aside until an hour and a 
half before dinner. Then cut the dough into as many pieces as there are 
persons to serve and roll out. Pare and core good, tart apples, set one 
un each sheet of dough, putting a teaspoonful of sugar and a small lump 
of butter in the place of the core, fold the dough about the apple, pinch- 
ing it tightly together, set them in a deep earthen dish and let rise half 
an hour; then sprinkle a tablespoonful of sugar over them and pour on 
one cupful of cold water and bake half an hour in a hot oven. It may 
be well to cover them with a greased paper to keep them from getting 
too brown or crusty. Eat warm with cream and sugar or any sauce 
preferred. Also excellent steamed. 

Boiled Apple Dumplings..— Pare eight fine apples and cut them in 
quarters, remove the cores. Roll the suet crust out half an inch thick and 



72 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

cut into round pieces. Dust each piece of apple with a little sugar and 
cinnamon and place four sections on each round of paste. Gather up 
the edges and pinch Ihem together over the apple. When all the dump- 
lings are made, drop them into a kettle of boiling water and .let them 
boil gently for an hour. Take them up on a hot dish and serve with 
plain, sweetened cream. If you want to serve the dumplings "just as 
grandmother did,'" sweeten the cream with "treacle." 

KenilwortI) Ranch Dumplings. — Take a quart of flour, one cup of 
good lard and half-cup of butter; rub this into the flour after it is sifted 
with one teaspoonful of baking powder; add enough milk to make ■ 
soft dough. This is rolled cut quickly into a sheet an inch thick and 
then cut in squares. Into each square is laid a half apple, peeled and 
cored, and the crust tucked around if. Have ready in a dripping pan 
a syrup made of one cupful of sugar to one of water; lay the dumplings 
in; bake in quick oven 30 to 40 minutes. Serve with an old-fashioned 
molasses sauce. 

Farmhouse Apples. — Peel and core tart apples, fill the space from 
which the cores were taken with seeded raisins, bits of shredded citron, 
sugar and a little lemon peel ; stand them in a baking pan, pour over 
them half a cup of water and dust with about two tablespoon fuls of 
granulated sugar. Bake in a slow oven until perfectly tender, then 
sprinkle bread crumbs over the top ; dust again with sugar, and leave 
ihem in the oven for 10 minutes. While they are baking mix a table- 
spoonful of flour with a half cup sugar; pour over half a pint of boiling 
water, and boil a moment; take from the fire, and pour slowly ovfer one 
well-beaten egg; add the juice of half a lemon. Pour over the apples 

Apple Fool. — Peel, core and quarter six large apples, cook them until 
tender with three or four cloves, a small piece of lemon peel, half a 
cupful of sugar and a teacupful of water. Remove the cloves and lemon 
peel, beat well with a fork and stir in one-fourth pint of thick, sweet 
cream. Cut any kind of delicate cake into rather thin slices and place a 
layer in the bottom of a glass dish. Pour over it diluted red currant 
jelly, then cover with a thick layer of the apple fool, then another layer 
of cake and currant jelly, and heap the remainder of the apple fool over 
the top. With each helping serve a large spoonful of whipped cream 
flavored with almond. 

Hidden Apples, — Butter a deep tin pan, cover the bottom with a layer 
of pared and quartered apples. In another dish beat an .egg well, put in 
enough sugar to sweeten the apples, add a little water, thicken with 
powdered bread crumbs, flavor highly with lemon. Pour this mixture 
over apples and bake until the apples are done, which will take about 
BO minutes in a hot oven.

Apple Johnny Calce. — Mix two cupfuli of commeal, a laltspoonful of 
salt, a teaspoonful of cream of tartar, a scant half-cupful of sugar, half 
a teaspoonful of soda dissolved in a little warm water and milk to make 
a thin batter. Stir in three sour apples that have been peeled and cut 
into thin slices. Bake in a shallow tin in a moderate oven for 35 minutes. 

Apple Kisses, — Select six small, smooth apples. Pare, cut in half and 
remove the core. Mix one-half a cupful of sugar with one-third cupful 
of butter. Place this mixture between the halves of the apples. Place 
in a baking dish with a little water and a teaspoonful of vanilla extract 
Bake till apples are soft. Serve with their own juice for sauce. 

Apple Pancakes.— Measure two cupfuls of sifted flour; add, half a 
teaspoonful of salt and sift again. Then stir in gradually two cupfuls of 
cold water and the beaten yolks of three or four eggs, making a per- 
fectly smooth batter. When well mixed, fold in (he whites of the eggs 
beaten to a froth. Place a tablespoonful of fat in an iron frying pan 
and when hot pour in enough batter to cover the bottom of the pan 
quarter of an inch thick ; have a few nicely-flavored apples, pared, cored 
and finely minced ; sprinkle a layer of the apple over the cake (not too 
much, or the pancake is liable to break).' As the cake cooks, slip a 
flexible knife under it, lifting it so it will not burn, and shake the pan 
gently to and fro. When the pancake is a light brown on under side, 
' slip it on to a hot plate, put a piece of butter on top of the apples, hold 
the fryit^ pan over it and deftly turn the cake back into the pan and 
cover and cook until the apples are soft Then slip it out of pan on to a 
hot plate; set the plate ever hot water to keep the cake warm and con- 
tinue frying up remainder of the batter in same manner. Serve them 
separately or piled, one upon the other. Serve with sugar sprinkled over 
them and oranges or lemons cut in halves for squeezing over them. This 
quantity of batter should make four cakes. Do not have your pan too 
large. 

Apple Custard Pancakes.— Beat four eggs light, adding to them a half 
pint of cream and a little ground cinnamon. Peel and core the apples, 
cut them in thin slices and fry them tender in a little butter. When 
browned slightly, turn them over, pour in the custard and fry to a lijht 
brown. Turn out on a hot flat dish and sprinkle powdered sugar over 
the pancake, 

Apple Pie. — As a variation from the ordinary pie with two crusts, 
slice apples into a deep earthen pie dish, sweeten and flavor to taste, and 
coyer with a top crust only. The absence of a soggy bottom crust is 
usually viewed as an advantage. 

Apple Custard Pie. — Peel and cut apples very fine. Line a deep pan 
with crust, put in the apples; scatter over them small pieces of butter 
and a covering of granulated sugar. Then pour over all a cupful of 



74 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

sweet cream and bake until the apples are cooked. Serve just before it 
is quite cold. 

Dutch Apple Pie. — Make a rich pufE paste and line deep pie plate. 
Core and cut into eighths as many rich tart apples as will fill the pie 
plate by laying each piece of apple with the curved side up, just as close 
together as can be placed; over the top sprinkle half cup light brown 
sugar, half teaspoonful cinnamon and tablespoonful flour. Dot bits of 
butter over the top and add half cup water; bake slowly and carefully 
until apples are tender and water absorbed. Serve warm with cheese. 

Dried Apple Pie. — Cook a large handful of dried apples quickly in > 
tightly-covered granite basin in a little less than a quart of water. Six 
halves of dried apricots arc cut fine and cooked in very little water. Fill 
in the apple, then the apricot, together with water they were cooked in; 
add a small cupful of sugar, and nutmeg, making the pie with two crusts, 
and bake quickly. 

Apple Pot-pie.— Serve this with maple-sugar sauce. Half fill a deep 
dish with sour apples which have been quartered, pared and cored. Pour 
over them a little boiling water and place in a hot oven until tender. 
Make a crust as for baking powder biscuit, roll out an inch thick; lay 
it over the apples and return to the oven for about 40 minutes or until 
the crust is done. For the sauce cook together two tablespoonfuls of 
butter and one teaspoonful of flour, add half a cupful of maple syrup 
and a tiny pinch of mace, and cook until clear and smooth. 

Apple Pudding. — Make a dough as for baking powder biscuit ; roll out 
one-quarter inch thick. Peel and slice good tart apples rather thin; put 
them in the middle of the dough, put on them half a cupful of sugar, 
tablespoonful of butter, and nutmeg. Wet the edges, lap over the applet 
well to. keep the juice in, put over the apples a little water, put pudding 
in a cheesecloth bag, and boil two hours steady. Eat with good cream. 

Baked Apple Pudding. — Butter a granite or enameled pie tin and fill 
it with pared and quartered Duchess apples, cut in rather thick slices. 
Cover with a thick batter made from a cup of flour, in which a teaspoon- 
ful of baking powder, a saltspoon of salt and a tablespoon of butter 
have been well mixed. Add two-thirds of a cup of sweet milk, or sour 
milk in which a quarter of a teaspoon of soda has been dissolved; we 
prefer the sour milk. Only about half as much baking powder is 
required with the sour milk as when sweet milk is used, but we always 
use some and find that it makes the food lighter and better than where 
soda alone is used. When the pudding is done reverse it on a plate, 
spread with butter and sprinkle over it a half cup of sugar, add a few 
gratings of nutmeg. Eat with cream. 

Canadian Pudding.— One quart of quartered sour apples, one-half cup- 
ful of sugar, one-fourth cupful of water, a pinch of grated nutmeg. Bake 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 75 

these ingredients together 20 minutes in a deep pudding dish; then remove 
and pour over the apples the following batter ; One cupful of flour, one 
tablespoonful sugar, one-fourth teaspoonfnl salt, one beaten egg, two 
tablespoon fills of soft butter. Return to the oven, increase the heat and 
bake for 20 minutes more. Serve with maple sauce made as follows ; 
Add to one thoroughly-beaten egg one cupful of grated maple sugar, one 
cupful of whipped cream, one-half teaspoonful of vanilla. In Vermont, 
where this recipe was obtained, a bowl of grated maple sugar invariably 
accompanied most desserts. Pudding sauces were always well covered 
with it 

Caramel Pudding. — Peel, core and slice enough sour apples to measure 
one pitit. Cook them slowly in a saucepan in two tablespoonfuls of 
butter until soft ; then add one cupful of sugar, one-quarter of a tea- 
spoonful of cinnamon, two tablespoonfuls of caramel and simmer for 
twenty minutes. Mix together one and on»-half cupfuls of stale bread 
crumbs, one-half cupful of crumbled stale macaroons and one-half cupful 
of seedless raisins. Butter a deep dish and fill with alternate layers of 
the apples and bread mixture, having crumbs on top. Bake three-quarters 
of an hour in a rather hot oven, and serve cold with whipped cream. 

Eureka Pudding, — Put one or two quarts of boiling water in stewpan, 
ajdd commeal to make a thick gruel, and teaspoonful of salt. Let it boil 
long and slowly. While cooking peel and slice five or six (more or less) 
good cooking apples; add to gruel. Let boil tender, add sugar and boil 
longer as for apple sauce. Turn into a mold and eat hot or cold with 
cream or boiled milk. This can he improved by putting the whites oF 
eggs beaten stiff into pudding before taken from the fire; add the yotks 
to the boiled milk and serve with the pudding. 

German Pudding.— Pare, tore and slice eight or 10 sour apples and 
put in a deep pudding dish, sweetening with one cupful of sugar, and 
sprinkling with a little lemon juice. Pour over them a rich egg batter,

Cook half an hour in the boiler, stirring often. Now add the other 
ingredients ; pour into a deep, well-greased pudding dish and bake slowly. 
Eat with cream or maple syrup. 

Queen Apple Pudding. — Make a rich pie crust, and roll out in an 
oblong sheet. Spread with chopped apples, cinnamon, sugar and butter 
(cream the sugar and butter together for convenience in spreading), roll 
up like a jelly cake, and cut olT in two-inch lengths. Stand the slices in 
a dripping pan, with 9 little wafer ground them, and bake thoroughly for

inch thick, brush it over with the yolk of the egg and sprinkle with 
one tablespoonful of fine bread crumbs. Spread over it three apples 
p';eled and sliced thin. Sprinkle with one-half tablespoonful of sugar 
and roll the paste. Brush the loU with egg, sprinkle it with bread crumbs 
and roll it in a napkin that has been wrung out of hot water and thai 
has been covered on one side with flouft Lap the ends over securely, tie 
with a string and boil in water that has been slightly salted for an hour 
and a half. Serve with lemon sauce. 

Sour Apple Pudding. — Peel and slice several sour cooking apples into

with whipped cream or a creamy sauce made with sugar, white of eg^ 
and lump of butter. 

Apple Souffle.— Stew the apples as if for sauce, adding a little lemon 
pee! and juice. Spread the slewed apples high around a baking dish. 
Make a custard of the yolks of two eggs, a pint of milk, a pinch of 
cinnamon and a tablespoonful of sugar. Let the custard cool and then 
pour it into the dish with the apples. Beat the whites of the eggs and 
spread over the top, sprinkling with sugar, and set it in the oven to brown.

hour; loosen round the edges of the crust, turn it upside down on a hot 
platter, with a heated knife cu' info squares and serve at once. 

Apple Sponge— Beat the yolks of three eggs with half a cupful of 
powdered sugar; flavor with lemon; beat for about 10 minutes; add to 
it the beaten whites of the eggs. Peel three big tender apples ; cut them 
in thin little slices; sift half n cupful of flour with half a teaspoonful 
baking powder and mix well with the former; put it in a buttered baking 
pan and bake in moderate oven for half an hour; spread powdered sugar 

Apple Puffs. — Chop four sour apples very fine, stir into them one 
beaten egg, one-fourth cupful molasses, a cupful and a half of cornmeal, 
the same amount of sifted flour and half a teaspoonful of salt ; dissolve 
half a teaspoonful of soda in warm water and add it, using enough water 
to make a thin batter. Bake in buttered cups in a quick" oven. 

Royal George. — Dissolve half a teaspoonful of soda in a little warm 
water; add to a cupful of sour cream with a pinch of salt. Then add 
flour enough to make a dough ftitf enough to roll out. Roll this paste 
very thin and line a deep pudding dish with it, reserving a little for the. 
top. Fill the dish with tart apples, pared and quartered. Sprinkle half a 
cupful of sugar over them and dust with cinnamon. Cover with the rest 
of the paste, cut out in rings and diamonds, and bake until the apples 
are done. Eat hot with cream or sugar and butter beaten to a white 

Scalloped Apples. — Pare and quarter tart apples. Put in the baking 
dish a layer of cracker crumbs, cover liberally with butter and granu- 
lated sugar. Then lay the apples with edges lapping and sprinkle chopped 
almonds over them. Then put more crumbs, butter and sugar, then 
another layer of apples, and sprinkle lightly with crumbs, butter, sugar 
and cinnamon. Bake until apples are done. Serve with rich cream. 

Red Apple Sauce. — Wash and quarter — do not pare — enough red 
apples to fill the bean pot ; sprinkle over a cupful of sugar — more or less, 
according to the size of the pot — cover and place in the oven on ironing 
day. Cook three or four hours and pour into a pretty glass dish to cool. 
The result will be a delicious surprise in the matter of rich flavor and 
dainty appearance. 

Baked Apple Sauce. — Wash and rub dry a sufiicient number of Baldwin 
apples. Remove peel in long strips. Butter a beanpot and fill with the 
cored and sliced apples, packed in layers. Sprinkle each layer generously 
with sugar, and sparingly with tiny bits of butter, then cover with strips 
of peel. Repeat imtil the beanpot is full. Bake in a slow oven for two 
hours. Pour out, and with a fork remove the strips of peel. Serve 
heaped in sherbet glasses and topped with a spoonful of whipped cream. 



78 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Instead of the usual watery mass, you will have a rich red sauce, deli- 
cately flavored with the peel, and of about the consistency of marmalade. 

Steamed Apple Sauce,— Pare and slice the apples rather thinner than 
for sauce cooked in the usual way, dropping into cold water as you slice 
them. Drain, turn into the Inner vessel of a double boiler, and fit on the 
• cover. Fill the outer kettle with warm water and bring to a steady boil. 
Keep this up for half an hour after the boil begins, then lift the lid and 
beat the soft apple to a mush with a spoon. Close and cook 15 minutes 
longer. Run through a colander or a vegetable press, sweeten to taste 
while hot, and set away to cool. 

Apple Slump.— ^fake a thin apple sauce, sweeten and flavor with nut- 
meg; have about two quarts when done. Take pint flour, mix as for 
biscuit dough, drop the dough by small spoonfuls into the boiling sauce, 
after they have risen and got set turn over. When done take dumplings 
out in a deep dish and pour sauce over them ; serve hot.' 

Apple Butter Without Cider.— Procure a new 50-pound lard can, eight 
pounds light brown sugar. Peel and slice the apples. Then commence 
to fill the can, first a layer of apples, then a layer of sugar, and so on 
until the can is full. Cover tightly and let it stand 13 hours. Place on 
ftove and when it begins to boil set it back on the stove until it simmers, 
or boils gently. Do rot take off lid for five hours. Then remove and 
put in ground cloves and cinnamon to suit your taste. 

Suet Apple Dumplings. — One cup of chopped suet, two cups of flour, 
one tea spoonful 'of salt, mix with cold water into a dough; put the apples 
in as for pudding; tie in little cloths; drop into boiling water; boil one 
hour. Use any sauce, or sugar only.

CHAPTER VII. 

BRBAD AMD MUFFINS, 

Here is the recipe for making good bread, given by the great milling 
companies and used by food demonstrators : To one quart of lukewarm 
liquid — half water and half milk, or water alone — add two half-ounce 
compressed yeast cakes, or the usual quantity of liquid yeast, and stir 
until dissolved. Add one teaspoonful of salt and three tablespoonfuls 
of sugar, and when well dissolved stir in with wooden spoon three quarts 
of well-sifted flour, or until dough is sufficiently stiff to be turned from 
the mixing bowl to the molding board in a mass. If shortening is desired 
add two tablespoonfuls lard. Knead this dough, adding if necessary 
from time to time, flour until it becomes smooth and elastic and ceases 
to stick to fingers or board. Do not make dough too stiff. Spring wheat 
flour needs a little more working than Winter wheat, and should be a 
little softer to make it rise properly. Put dough into well -greased 
earthen bowl, brush lightly with melted butter or drippings, cover with 
towel and set in warm place, about 75 degrees, for two hours, or until 
light, then knead well and return to bowl, cover as before and set for 
another hour's rising, or until light. When light, form gently into loaves 
or rolls, place in greased bread pans, brush with butler or drippings, 
cover again and let stand for one and one-half hour, then bake. When 
bread becomes stale it may be made palatable again and as good as 
new, or even better than new, by wetting the old loaf with cold water, 
putting in the pan and rebaking it in the oven 20 to 45 minutes. It will, 
if originally good, come out moist and fresh, 

Boston Brown Bread. — Two cupfuls Indian meal; one cupful whole 
wheat flour; one cupful sour milk; one-third cupful molasses; one tea- 
spoonful soda; one-half teaspoonful salt. Mix and steam three hours, 
then brown m hot oven with the lid removed from the can. There are 
tin molds made smaller at the bottom than the top, so the loaf slips out 
nicely — the lid fitting on the outside of the tin to prevent the water 
getting in the bread, but any small tin pail with tight lid will answer 
the purpose. It is better to place an iron lid or ring in the bottom of 
the kettle to prevent the mold from coming too close to the fire. Slice 
around the loaf, not perpendicularly. 

Easy Brown Bread. — For one, loaf take one cup of sour milk, one cup 
of sweet milk, one teaspoon of salt, one-half cup of molasses with one 
teaspoon of soda thoroughly stirred in; add one-half cup of white flour 
and about three cups of graham flour. Mix so stiff that a little dough

drOK>ed from the spoon wSI not quickly lettle. Put in a deep brud 
pan and bake in a moderatelj hot oven for one hour. If not stiff enougli, 
the top crust may separate from the rest of the loaf. 

Entire Wheat Bread.— JCtae pint milk, scalded and cooled, one table- 
spoonful sugar, one teaspoonfn) salt, one-half cupful yeast, about five 
or ?ix cupfuls whole wheat flour. In the morning mix in the order 
given, and knead until smooth and elastic Let rise till l^ht, allow it 
to rise a little longer, and then bake a little longer, and in an oven not 
quite so hot, as for white bread. Whole-wheat bread rises more than 
white bread, because the flour contains more gluten. Sometimes we 
make a sponge with white Hour, in the same proportion as for ordinary 
bread, and then thicken and knead with the entire wheat flour. 

Light Bread. — Into two quarts of wheat flour stir a teaspoonful of 
granulated sugar and a half teaspoonful of salt, and sift into a large 
bowl. Bring to the scalding-point two cups of milk; stir into this a 
generous teaspoonful of butter, and, when this melts, add two cups of 
boiling water. Remove from the fire and set aside until blood-wariD, 
then stir in a gill of water of the same temperature, in which a half- 
cake of compressed yeast has been thoroughly dissolved Make a hollow 
in the centre of the sifted flour and pour in the liquid. Stir to a soft 
dough, then turn upon a floured hoard and knead for 15 minutes; set in 
a bread raiser in a warm place for six hours or until light Make mto 
three loaves of uniform size, knead each of these for at least live min- 
utes, put into a baking-pan, cover with a cloth, and set to rise until very 
light Bake in a steady oven. 

Oatmeal Brown Bread. — Mix :n a large bowl one pint of Quaker 
oats, a rounding teaspoonful of salt, a pint of Pettijohn's breakfast 
food, half a pint of whole wheat flour and half a pint of yellow gran- 
ulated commeal. Put into another bowl one pint of thick sour milk and 
half a pint of molasses. Dissolve a level teaspoonful of bicarbonate 
of soda in two tablespoon fuls of warm water; add this to the molasses 
and sour milk; stir until foaming; then add it to the dry ingredients 
and mix until every grain is moistened. Turn into a greased mold and 
boil or steam continuously for tour hours. Stand in a moderate oven 
for 30 minutes. It will then be ready to use. This may be toasted on 
the second day, or warmed over in the oven, or it may he used cold. 
Toasted it makes an acceptable breakfast bread. 

Scotch Oat Bread. — To two cups of steel-cut oatmeal, one teaspoon- 
ful soda and one teaspoonful salt add two cups of boiling water; when 
cool add one cup of molasses and one cake of yeast. Stand over ni(^L 
In the morning mix stiff with wheat flour. Shape into loaves, let riae 
and bake. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 81 

Salt-Ruing Bread. — Dissolve a half teaspoonful of salt in two cupt 
of scalding: water, and beat in gradually enough flour to make a very 
soft dough. Beat for 10 minutes, cover and set in a very wann place 
for eight hours. Now stir a teaspoonful of salt into a pint of lukewarm 
milk and add enough flour to make a stiff batter before working it into 
the risen dough. Mix thoroughly, cover and set again in a warm place 
to rise until very light. Turn into a. wooden bowl and knead in enough 
flour to make the batter of the consistency of ordinary bread dough. 
Make into loaves and set these to rise, and when light, bake. 

Sour Milk Corn Bread. — Mix together in a bowl three cupfuls of 
corn meal and one cupful of graham flour. Stir in a teaspoonful of 
salt, a tablcspoonful of melted butter, and two cupfuls of sour milk. 
Now beat in three eggs, whipped light, and a small teaspoonful of soda 
dissolved in a little boiling water. Beat for five minutes, then pour into 
a greased mold with a funnel in the center. Sake for an hour, or until 
a straw comes out clear from the thickest part of the loaf. 

Spoon Corn Bread. — Put a quart of milk, or half milk and half water, 
in a double boiler. Add four large kitchen spoonfuls of white cornmeal, 
and stir and cook five minutes. Remove from the fire and let it cool, 
stirring it once or twice as it cools. Then add two or three eggs beaten 
with two tablespoon fuls of wheat flour, one tablespoonful of butter and 
a scant teaspoonful of salt. Mix well, then pour into a greased baking 
dish, and bake 35 minutes. Serve immediately in dish in which it is 
baked, with a folded napkin wrapped around the dish. 

Susan's Conibread. — One cup white flour, one-half cup yellow corn- 
meal, one-half teaspoonful salt, one tablespoonful sugar, two teaspoon- 
fub baking powder. Sift dry ingredients, then mix with one beaten 
egg and enough sweet milk to make a thin batter, stirring in U the 
last a piece of butter the size of a walnut melted. Pour into a well- 
greased shallow pan and bake in a quick oven. 

Crackling Bread. — One quart of cornmeal — three pints make more 
dough — a pint of buttermilk, a teaspoonful of soda, a big pinch of salt, 
a pint of brown cracklings left from making lard, warm water. Crush 
the cracklings with a rolling pin, heat them and stir in the dough, 
which must be thick enough to mold well (thin with the warm water). 
Mold the bread with the hands in small oblong pones about three inches 
thick, putting the pones as you mold them in hot, well-greased pans. 
Bake in a hot oven until brown. 

Crumb-loaf. — Beat two eggs with a pinch of salt added; add a cupful 
of sweet milk and a quarter of a cupful of sugar. Stir in enongh 
bread cmmhs to make a medium thick batter, then add flour enough to 
thidcen like corn bread. Sift a teaspoonful of baking powder in with 



82 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

the flour. Bake to a rich, crifp brown and serve hot. Fine for either 
breakfast or supper. 

Egg Bread. — Two eggs, one pint of buttermilk, three pints of corn- 
meal, one-half pint of lard, one teaspoonful of soda, a pinch of salt, sweel 
milk or sweet cream. Stir the soda in the buttermilk until it boils up, 
mix the bread quickly, adding a sufUcient quantity of sweet milk or 
sweet cream to make a rather thin batter; beat in the eggs, and add 
the lard, melted and liot, last. Pour quickly into frying hot greased 
baking pans and bake quickly to a delicate brown. This bread will be a ■ 
golden yellow and as light as cake. 

Swedish Breakfast Bread. — Add one-third cup butter, one-fourth cup 
sugar, and one-half teaspoon salt to one cup scalded milk. When luke- 
warm, add one-third yeast-cake dissolved in one-fourth cup lukewarm 
milk, one egg, well beaten, one-half cup raisins, stoned and cut in pieces, 
and fiour to make a stiff batter. Cover and let rise over night; in morn- 
ing cut down and spread in buttered dripping-pan, one-half inch thick. 
Cover and let rise again. Before baking brush over with beaten egg and 
cover with the following mixture : Melt three taWespoons butler, add 
one-third cup sugar, and one teaspoon cinnamon. When sugar is par- 
tially melted, add three tablespoons flour. Bake in a moderate oven, and 
cut in squares for serving. 

Beaten Biscuits. — One quart of sifted fiour, one tablespoonful of 
lard, one-half pint cold water. Put the flour and salt in a bowl, rub the 
lard in with the bauds, add the water gradually. Work and knead until 
smooth and elastic. Then put the dough on a block and pound it with 
a mallet, rolling pin or ax for one hour until full of bubbles. The old- 
fnshioned rule was to "hit it SOO licks." Form into small round cakes, 
stick with a fork here and there, and bake in a moderately quick oven 
about 20 minutes. They should be brown on top, white on the sides, 
and extremely white inside. 

Bread-crumb Biscuits.^ — ^Take one quart each, of bread crumbs and 
sour milk, add one-half cupful of lard, one-half teaspoonful of salt, and 
stiffen with flour in which is put before sifting one teaspoonful each of 
saleratu.s and baking powder. Mold, and bake in a quick oven. Be 
sure to allow the crumbs to soak for an hour in the milk before adding 
the other ingredients. 

Buttermilk Biscuits. — Two coffeecupfuls (even) of flour, half a cof- 
feecupful of sour milk, half a coffeecupful of buttermilk, one teaspoonful 
of sugar, one teaspoonful of yeast powder, half a teaspoonful of salt,

flour and sift; dissolve soda in two tablespoonfuls of cold water, beat 
into the sour milk until it stops "purring," mix quickly with dry ingre- 
dients, using a spoon, turn on a well-floured board, pat with the hand 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 83 

into a cake half an inch thick, roll, cut into biscuitE; bake in a very 
hot oven 10 minutes. 

French Biscuits. — One cupful of butter, one cupful of sugar, the stif- 
fly-beaten white of one egg, one-fourth cupful of thick sour milk, half 
a teaspoOnful of soda dissolved in a very little hot water, flour enough 
to make a dough that may be rolled out. Sprinkle with sugar, cut into 
iarge circles, and bake for 20 minutes. 

Martha Washington Biscuits. — Sift one pint of flour with one table- 
spoonful of sugar, one teaspoonful each of baking powder and salt. Rub 
into it one tablespoonful of lard. Mix with one well-beaten egg and one 
rupful of water; roll one-fourth of an inch in thickness and cut with 
small round cutter. Fry in hot fat until cooked on one side, turn and 
brown. 

Molded Biscuits. — One quart of flour, into which two heaping tea- 
spoonfuls of baking powder and one of salt have been sifted; rub into 
it a scant half cupful of lard and butter, half and half; stir to a dough 
with enough milk to make it just too thin to roll out. Grease muffin 
rings and put on a greased baking pan ; drop from a spoon dough enough 
nearly to fill each ring; bake in a quick oven. Delicious tea cake, to be 
eaten hot with butter, is made by adding a tablespoonful of sugar and one 
well-beaten egg to this recipe and baking in one loaf, or in a large flat 
cake to be split open and buttered, then cut in sections. 

Potato Biscuits. — Pare and boil six white potatoes. While hot put 
through a ricer, then add gradually one pint of scalded milk, one-half of 
a cupful of butter, one teaspoonful each of salt and sugar and one-half 
of a cupful of flour. Let stand until lukewarm, then add one yeast cake 
dissolved in a little warm water and sifted flour to make a soft dough. 
Knead lightly, using no more flour than is needed to keep from sticking 
to the hoard. Cover and let stand again until very light, then form 
into small rolls, handling most carefully and greasing the hands if the 
dough is inclined to stick. Place in greased pans, let stand until fully 
doubled in bulk, then bake about twenty minutes in a quick oven. 

Sour Cream Biscuits.— Use three good tablespoonfuls of thick sour 
cream ; put this into a quart measure and fill it two-thirds full with 
sweet milk; add half a teaspoonful of salt, two teaspoonfuls of cream 
of tartar and a teaspoonful of soda. Stir into this enough flour to make 
a dough that will roll very soft; cut into small biscuits, brush well with 
melted butter, and bake about ao minutes in a good oven. 

Tea Biscuits, — For a six o'clock tea, set the batter about one o'clock. 
Add to one quart sifted flour a teaspoonful sugar, a heaping teaspoonful 
salt, and a tablespoonful each lard and butter; rub in well; dissolve one- 
half yeast cake (compressed) in a little tepid water; add to a cupful 
Bweet milk; then mix well with the flour; cover and set out of 3 draught

to rise; when light turn out ciu the molding board, sprinkle with a very 
little flour and roll out to the thickness of half an inch; cut out with 
two sizes of round cutters, placitig the smaller ones on top of the 
larger, with a brushing of melted butter between; let stand about an 
hour to rise, then bake. The oven does not need to be as hot as for 
baking powder biscuit. 

Sugared Biscuits. — Ordinarj- biscuit dough is made, rolled out as for 
cutting, and then lightly spread with butter and sugar, creamed together. 
The dough is then rolled up like a jelly roll, and cut into slices like cin- 
namon buns, each biscuit being sprinkled on top with a little more 
butter and sugar. 

Yarmouth Biscuit.^ — Mix three-quarters of a pound of sifted flour, 
one-half pound of sugar and one-half pound of currants to a paste with 
half a pound of butter and three eggs. Roll out to one-eighth of an 
inch in thickness and bake a light hrown in quick oveti. 

Brioche. — Th's is one of the delicate breads that delight visitors in 
Trance. One-half pound flour, one egg. one teaspoon sugar, two ounces 
butter, oTie- half teaspoon salt, one-quarter pint milk, one ounce yeasts 
Sift the flour. Heat milk lukewarm and dissolve in it the butler and 
yeast. Add the egg, well beaten, and the salt and sugar. Then stir 
in the flour, gradually working it all the time with your hand. Beat 
mixture well for 10 minutes, till the dough almost stops sticking to 
your fingers. Cover with a cloth and set in a warm place to rise. When 
four times its original size turn it on a floured board and take pieces 
about the size of a turkey's egg and form into fancy shapes, twists, 
knots, etc. Put in a buttered tin and let rise IS minutes. When risen, 
brush over lightly with the egg beaten up. Bake in quick oven 20 min- 

Buckwheat Cake. — This is an old Canadian recipe and very good. 
Make batter as for buckwheat pancakes, only a trifle thicker, and bake 
in well-greased shallow pan, like com bread. There should be a delicious 
brown crust on the bottom. The prepared flour can be used. 

Breakfast Buns.— Scald one-half pint of milk; pour it over two table- 
spoonfuls of sugar; one quart of lukewarm water; when milk is luke- 
warm add tlie yeast and. enough flour to make a "sponge." Let rise until 
it doubles its original bulk, about two hours ; then cream together half 
a cupful of butter and half a cupful of sugar; add two well-beaten 
eggs and one cupful of scalded milk. Mix this into the sponge and 
add sufficient flour to make a soft dough; knead lightly, cover and set 
to rise until very light ; then mold into small buns and lay in greased 
pans, allowing plenty of room to rise; then bake in a quick Oven for IS 
cr 80 minutes. They must not be heavy and doughy. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 8! 

Hot Cross Buns. — Beat a quarter cup of butter to a cream ; add four 
tablespoonfuls of sugar and then add gradually a pint of milk that has 
been scalded and cooled; add a yeast cake, dissolved, and sufficient flour 
to make a batter. Beat thoroughly. Stand in a warm place for about 
three hours. Then add four eggs well beaten and flour enough to make 
a soft dough. Knead carefully. Stand aside until very light and form 
into buns. Cut them in the center; brush them with sugar and white of 
egg and bake in a quick oven. 

German Coffee Cake. — Take enough dough after it is mixed for one 
loaf and add one egg, shortening half the size of an ^g and one-half 
cupful of sugar. Mix thoroughly through the dough and add flOur 
enough to roll out an inch thick; let rise and wet the top of it with 
cold water, sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon, and bake. To be cut 
in slices and eaten with or wiihout butter for breakfast with coffee and 
put up for the children's school lunches in place of so much rich cake. 
For variety roll the dough qi'ite thin and sprinkle it with currants well 
cleansed and dates or flgs cut in small bits ; then roll up tightly and 
with a sharp knife cut into slices one-half inch thick, lay in greased 
pans, let rise and bake in moderate heat. 

Fastnachts. — Mix to a light sponge the following ingredients : Three- 
fourths quart of warm milk, cne-half pound of sifted flour, four ounces 
of melted butter, one ounce (-1 yeast, one-half cupful of sugar, one e^, 
one-half pound of warmed currants, the grated rind cf a lemon, one 
teaspoonful of cinnamon. Set in a warm place to rise, when light add 
enough flour to mold into biscuits, place them on baking tins and let 
rise once more, then rub over the top with a brush dipped in a well- 
beaten egg. Bake in a hot oven. Many prefer to serve them warm 
with butter. 

Bran Gems.— Beat two eggs very light, add half a teaspoonful of salt, 
a tablespoonful of brown sugar and one and one-half cupfuls of milk, 
then stir in a pint of finely ground bran. Fill otied gem pans half full 
and bake in a hot oven 20 minutes. These gems are advised in some 
forms of indigestion, where line flour is objectionable. 

Corn Gems.— Sift together one pint of cornmeal, one pint of flour and 
two teaspoonfuls of baking powder. Add one-third of a pint each of 
milk and water. Mix into a 6rm batter and fill greased gem pans two- 
thirds full. 

Entire Wheat Gems. — Three cupfuls entire wheat flour or wheat 
meal, two cupfuls cold water, half cupful of milk. Heat gem pans very 
hot on the top of the stove, fill them even full of the batter, place on the 
grate of a very hot oven. Let them remain 10 minutes on the grate, 
then bake 30 minntei on the bottom of (he o?eii. They are tl«ftrly u

good if 2'/i cupfuls of water and no milk is used. Do not use any salt, 
or they will not be so light. 

Puff Gems. — Beat very light one egg, then add to it one-quarter cup- 
ful sugar, two tablespoontuls of melted butter, one cupful' of sour milk. 
Beat all well. Then add one cupful of cornmeal and one cupful of 
white flour into which has been well mixed one heaping teaspoonful of 
baking powder. Lastly dissolve one-quarter teaspoonful of soda in 
tablespoonful of boiling water, add, beat well and pour in gem pans, i 
bake 20 minutes in a hot oven. 

Golden Johnny Cake. — Heat to scalding point one pint of sweet milk; 
while hot stir into it one teaspoonful butter, one teaspoonful whiti 
gar and three-fourths of a cupful of steamed squash out of which all 
water has been pressed. Sift together two cupfuls cornmeal, one cup- 
ful flour, two heaping teaspoonfuls baking powder and a scant ti 
spoonful salt. Add to this, gradually, the milk and squash, as soon as 
IS lukewarm. Bake in one greased pan, or in gem pans if preferred. If 
it seems stiff a little more milk may be added. Bake in a quick oven. 
Meal varies so that it is hard to give the exact quantity. 

Oatmeal Gems. — Separate two eggs; beat the yolks tor a moment; add 
a half pint of milk, then one and one-half cup of bread flour, and beat 
thoroughly; add a tablespoonful of melted butter, a half -teaspoonful of 
salt, one cup of left-over oatmeal porridge and one rounding teaspoonful 
of baking powder. Beat for about two minutes. Fold in carefully the 
well-beaten whites of the eggs. Pour this mixture into 12 greased gent 
pans and bake in a moderately quick oven 20 minutes. 

Popovers. — To make them without baking powder beat three eggs 
until very light, then add two cupfuls of sweet milk and one-half tea- 
spoonful of salt. Stir in four cupfuls of flour, and see that the batter 
is very smooth; then add one additional cupful of milk and a piece 
of butter the size of an egg, melted. Heat the pop-over irons or cups, 
and when they are very hot nearly fill with the batter. Bake in a 
quick oven for half an hour. To make pop-overs with baking powder re- 
quires one egg, well beaten, one large spoonful of melted butter, two 
table spoonfuls of sugar, one cupful of sweet milk, lyi cupful of flour, 
salt, and one-fourth teaspoonful of baking powder. 

Popovers Without Eggs.— One cup of milk, one cup of water, no salt 
and no baking powder. The gem pans are heated, a piece of butter the 
size of a walnut being put to melt in each little pan while the batter is 
beaten up. The oven must be good, with steady heat, and the door 
must not be opened for 35 minutes after the popovers are put in, or 
they will fall. Salt will prevent them from rising, but if made accord- 
ing to directions, they will be very light, plour fpough for drop batter. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 8T 

Breakfast Rolls. — Three cups of sweet milk, one cup of butter or 
lard; dissolve one yeast cake in a cup of warm water, mix with flour 
enough to make dough. Let rise over night, in the morning add one 
egg, knead thoroughly, let rise again, and when light make out in rolls. 
Place in pans, keep warm, and bake when very light. 

Buttermilk Muffins, — A quart of fresh buttermilk, one teaspoonful of 
soda, a pinch of salt and enough flour to make a stiff batter and two 
or three tables poo nfuls of sour cream. Dissolve the soda in a little 
of the buttermilk, then add to the rest ; add salt and cream and the 
flour. Bake in gem pans in a hot oven. 

Bread Sponge Muffins. — Late in the evenmg set a sponge as for 
water bread, allowing a pint of warm water for a dozen muffins, a 
third of a cake of compressed yeast and a pinch of salt. Mix the bat- 
ter a little thicker than for pancakes and beat thoroughly. In the 
morning have gem pans greased, and in cold weather warm them; pour 
in the batter without stirring, filling half full ; let them rise at least an 
hour and bake in a hot oven. 

Cape Cod Muffins. — Sift two cupfuls of flour with two teaspoonful^ 
of baking powder, a half -tea spoonful of salt and one rounded teaspoonful 
of sugar. Beat three eggs without separating; add to them lyi cupful 
of milk and stir the milk and eggs into the flour. Have ready a cupful 
of carefully-cleaned blueberries and .stir them lightly into the mixture. 
Bake in hot buttered gem pans in a quick oven for 15 minutes. 

Cream of Wheat Muffins. — Add to two cupfuls of cooked cream of 
wheat, a cupful of milk and work it smooth, then two eggs well beaten 
and a tablespoonful of sugar; to a pint of flour add two small tea- 
spoonfuls of baking powder, and a half teaspoonful of salt, rub into the 
flour a tablespoonful lard or butter; add to these ingredients the wheat 
that has been mixed with the milk and eggs. Butter muffin pans, fill them 
two- thirds full, and bake in a hot oven 30 minutes. 

Crumb Muffins. — Scraps of stale bread, toasted in the oven until 
crisp, find many uses. We run them through the food chopper until fine 
enough for use. If these crumbs are sifted, the fine particles will be 
found very nice for muffins and griddle cakes. For muffins, use one 
egg, one tablespoonful of butter, one teaspoonful of sugar and half that 
of baking powder, two cupfuls of the crumbs and one of flour; mix 
with water or sweet milk and bake slowly in gem pans. For griddle 
cakes use two cupfuls of crumbs to one of self-raising buckwheat flour. 

English Muffins. — Dissolve half of a compressed yeast cake in six 
tablespoon tu Is of lukewarm water. Have a pint of milk scalding hot 
and stir into it a heaping teaspoonful of lard Boil until the lard is dis- 
solved, then take from the fire and, when the milk is blood warm, stir it 



88 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Sradually into a pint of flour that has been sifted with two saltspoontali 
of salt. When the milk is all worked in, add the dissolved yeast cake, 
and blend thoroughly- Turn the batter into a bread raiser and set to 
rise in a moderately warm room for six or eight hours, or until light 
When light, turn the mass out upon a Hoiired pastry board and break 
off bits of the dough, having them ol uniform size, and each about as 
large as an ordinary tea biscuit. Handle very lightly, and roll each 
muffin in flour. Have a soapstone griddle thoroughly heated and lay ■ 
these muffins upon it. Bake them without touching until they swell to 
twice their original size. When brown on the under side lift carefully 
and turn. When the other side is baked to a delicate brown, the muf- 
fins are done. When ready to use, tear them open, toast and butler 
generously. 

Parker House Rolls. — Scald one pint of milk with a piece of butter 
the size of an egg added. Put the milk into a bread pan with one table- 
spoon of sugar and one teaspoon of salt. When the milk has cooled a 
trifle, sift in sufficient flour to make a stiff batter. Now add one cake 
of yeast and beat well, then add flour to make a soft loaf and knead 
thoroughly. Let it stand over night. In the morning, little kneading is 
required. Roll out this and cut with a biscuit-cutter. Brush over with 
melted butter, lap one-half over the other, put in a pan not too close 
together, , and when very light, bake in a quick oven. 

Quick Cinnamon Rolls. — Sift together two cups of flour, two teaspoon- 
fuls of baking powder and ;i half teaspoonful of salt. Into this rub 
one tablespoonful of butter. Mix with milk to make a soft dough. Roll 
out to half an inch in thickness, spread with warmed butter and sprinkle 
with two tablespoon fuls of brown sugar, one teaspoonful of cinnamon 
and scatter over one-half cup of seeded raisins. Roll up as for jelly 
cake and cut into inch slices; place so as they will touch in a pan and 
bake in a quick oven. 

Scotch Scones. — Take two pounds of fine oatmeal, a tablespoonful 
of salt, a tablespoonful of lard and enough water to make a stiff dough. 
Rub the lard into the oatmeal and add the salt and water. In rolling 
the palm of the hand sbould be used instead of a rolling-pin. Press the 
dough into a round cake about a quarter of an inch thick, cut into seg- 
ments and cook on a griddle over a slow fire until a light brown. Oat- 
meal scones properly prepared will keep for weeks. 

Boston Tea Cakes.— Beat two eggs in a teacup, fill the cup with sweet 
milk, turn into a bowl with one cupful of sugar, 10 even teaspoonfuls of 
melted butter, IJ^ cupful of flour and two teaspoonfuls of baking pow- 
der. This is the most reliable, easily made and accommodating of cakes. 
Delicious baked in layers and spread with jam or cream. May be baked 
in a loaf or small patty pans. Serve warm with tea. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 89 

English Tea Cake— Sift four cupfuU of dried flour into a bowl and 
chop into it a scant cupful of butter. Dissolve half a yeast cake in fonr 
tablespoon fuls of warm water and stir it into two cupfuls o! milk, or 
enough to make a soft dough. Roll this out into a sheet and cut into 
cakes as large as a tea plate and less than half an inch thick. Set them, 
covered lightly, in a warm place until they have nearly trebled in thick- 
ness. Bake in a floured pan. Keep them covered for 20 minutes, then 
brown. Run a sharp knife around the edge, tear the cake open, butter 
and serve upon a plate lined and covered with a heated napkin. 

Zimmet-Kuchen. — Two cupfuls of bread sponge, one rgg, half a cup- 
ful of sugar, butter the size of a walnut, one cupful of warm water. 
Mix these ingredients together and make n dough not quite as stiff as 
for bread. Let it rise well, roll out one-half inch thick, let it rise again 
until quite l^ht. Spread the dough thinly and evenly in a long shallow 
tia Cover with an egg beaten with a tablespoonful of sugar and 
sprinkle liberally with powdered cinnamon and granulated sugar. The 
ingredients on the kuchen will melt and run together into a delicious can- 
died top. Serve by cutting into strips one inch wide. 

Butter Cakes. — Sift two cupfuls of floor with three teaspoonfuls of 
baking powder and a half teaspoonful of salt. Rub in two tablespoonful s 
of butter and add gradually three-fourths of a cupful of milk. Toss 
upon a well-floured board and roll out as thick as though you were 
making biscuit, then cut into rounds witft a small biscuit cutter and bake 
upon a hot, well-greased griddle. Cook slowly until they puff up double 
their size, then turn and bake on the other side. Set them in a moderate 
oven for a few minutes before serving, then break them open and serve 
with butter and maple syrup. 

Waflles. — For the batter use one pint of sifted flour, one level tea- 
spoonful baking powder, one-half teaspoonful salt, one tablespoonful but- 
ter, melted, two eggs and V/i cupful milk ; beat to a smooth batter. Heat 
the waflle iron very hot; grease both lids; put a cooking spoonful of 
batter into each lid, and cook five minutes on each side Slip out on to a 
hot dish. Place in the oven until more are cooked, then put them one 
on top of the other, each buttered and heaped with grated maple sugar.

CHAPTER VIII. 

CAKES. 

"Breathfs there a man with bddI so dead 
He lores not new-baked ginger bread? 
Wbo, stepping tbrough tbe kitchen 'door, 
On baking day sees goodly store 
Of fragrant amber-shadowed cake. 
And, ball-uncoDscious, do«s not break 
A ragged chunk I Ab, toothaome blLaa ! 
He Is a cbutl wbo knows not this." 

To get a fine grained cake, beat thoroughly after the flour is added. 
Sweet milk makes cake that cuts like pound cake. Sour milk makes 
spongy, light cake. Always sjft flour before measuring, then it may be 
sifted again with the baking powder to insure their being thoroughly 
blended. In making fruit cakes add the fruit before putting in the flour, 
as this will prevent it falling to the bottom of the cake. Flouring the 
fruit is unnecessary, unless the fruit is damp. If a cake cracks open 
while baking, the recipe contains too much flour. In creaming butter 
and sugar, when the butter is too hard to blend easily, warm the l^owl 
and if necessary warm the sugar, but never warm the butter, as this will 
change both texture and flavor of the cake. The smaller ihe cake the 
hotter should be the oven. Large rich cakes require very slow bakii^. 
Grease cake pans with lard or drippings, as butter will be likely to make 
the cake stick, owing to the salt in it. 

When eggs are short in the Winter snow may be used as a substitute ; 
one of Tbe R. N.-Y. housewives says that one cupful of snow, beaten in 
after all the ingredients are put together, is equal to two eggs. 

Almond Cookies. — Cream together one-half cupful of butter and two 
cupfuls sugar. Stir in alternately a little at a time one cupful of sweet 
milk and twice sifted flour to make a dough which can be handled. With 
the last of the flour sift in two teaspoonfuls of baking powder; roll out 
one-quarter inch thick ; before cutting out sprinkle with a cup of glmonds 
which have been blanched and chopped and a teaspoon of granulated 
sugar mixed through them. Bake in quick oven. These should be eaten 
fresh, as should all cakes made without the addition of eggs. 

Angel Cake. — Four ounces and a heaping tablespoonful of flour, 12 
ounces of powdered sugar, the whites of H eggs beaten to a very stiff 
froth (flavor with rose before beating), a teaspoonful of cream of tartar 
and a little salt, Mi^ the sugar, flour, salt and cream of tartar together 
and sift through a very fine sieve six times. Then stir in lightly the 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 91 

beaten whites. Bake in a new pan, without greasing, £or *0 minutes. 
After taking from the oven, invert the pan and place upon cups or 
tumblers until the cake is cold, then remove and cover with a thin icing. 
No' soda is nsed. A pan with a tin tube in the center is preferable for 

Angel Cake No. 3— Take the whites of nine large eggs. Add to 
them a pinch of salt and whip them lightly until they are partly stiff, 
then add half a teaspoonful of cream of tartar and whip them until very 
stiff. Fold in carefully one and one-fourth cupful of granulated sugar , 
that has been sifted three times. Sift one cupful of the best pastry 
flour seven times (if you want a perfect cake), and fold it into the 
sugar and whipped eggs lightly. Last of all, add a teaspoonful of 
vanilla. Turn the cake into a large, unbutlered pan. Bake in a moderate 
oven from 35 to 50 minutes. Never open the oven door until you think 
the cake is done, as it falls very easily. On taking it from the oven 
turn it upside down in such a way that current of air will pass under 
it until it is cold. When cold loosen the cake from the sides of the pan 
and lift it out. It should be so delicately baked that this will not be 
difficult. If you intend to ice it cover it with a soft uncooked icing 
made with powdered sugar, white of egg and a very little vanilla. 
Angel cake is generally better for being kept a day before serving. If it 
is a little tough place it in a stone jar and cover with a plate. Let it 
' stand for two or three days in this way and it will become tender. 

Apple Cake. — Measure two cupfuls of sifted flour, add two teaspoon- 
fuls of baking powder and half a teaspoonful of salt and sift again into 
a mixing bowl; make a well in the center; beat whiles of two and yolk 
of one egg until light, add grated rind of a lemon, one tablespoonful of 
melted butter and a cupful of milk; mix this gradually into the flour 
until you have a thick batter or very soft dough. Spread this on shallow, 
well-buttered tins, having batter not more than half an inch thick. Pare 
and cut into eighths enough large, tart apples to cover the top of the 
cake by laying the pieces close together in rows, pressing the sharp edges 
into the dough; brush well with softened but not melted butter, sprinkle 
thickly with granulated sugar and bake in a hot oven. When done dust 
-with powdered sugar and cinnamon. 

Dutch Apple Cake. — Measure a pint of sifted flour, add half a level 
teaspoonful salt, quarter of a cupful of sugar and a scant teaspoonful 
of soda. Sift three times. Beat up one egg with a cupful of sour milk. 
Rub a third of a cupful of butter into the flour thoroughly ; then mix 
■in the liquid, making a soft dough. Spread this half an inch thick in a 
well-greased biscuit pan. Pare and core five juicy, nicely -flavored apples, 
and cut them into eighths ; arrange them in parallel rows, sharp edges 
down, on top of the dough, pressing down so that they are partially 



93 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

imbedded' in the dough. SprinKle over thickly with sugar and a little 
1 and spread with bits of butter. Bake in a quick oven for 25 
Serve hot as a dessert or tea cake. Made with fresh, ripe 
peaches cut in quarters, it is delicious. Omit the cinnamon when peaches 
are used. 

Apple Kuchen, — One pint of flour, one teaspoonful of cream of tartar, 
one-half teaspoonful of soda, one-half teaspoonful salt, an e^, a cupful 
of milk, two tablespon fills of butter, four large apples. Sift salt, soda 
• and cream of tartar with the flour and rub in the butter. Put the 
beaten egg into the milk and mix with the flour. Spread the dough 
one-half inch thick on a buttered pan. Cut the pared apples in eighths 
and stick into the dough in rows. Sprinkle with sugar and bake 2S 



Apple Laye* Cake. — One cupful of sugar creamed with half a cupful 
'«t butter; add the beaten yolks of four eggs, one-half cupful of milk, 
two cupfuls of flour, with two level teaspoonfuls of baking powder sifted 
through it. One teaspoonful of lemon or almond extract and the beaten 
whites of the eggs. Bake in three layers. When cold spread with this 
mixture: Peel and grate four large apples, beat into them one cupful of 
sugar, two teaspoonfuls of melted butter and two whipped eggs. Pour 
into a porcelain saucepan and stir steadily over a moderate fire until the 
mixture has boiled one minute. Remove from the fire," add two tea- 
spoonfuls of lemon juice, a dash of powdered cinnamon and two table- 
spoonfuls of minced almonds. Cool it and build the cake, sprinkling 
the top with powdered sugar. nCap the top generously with whipped 
cream, flavored, "and serve at the table. 

Apple Sauce Cake. — One cup sugar, ^ cup shortening, one s»i(spoon 
salt, yi teaspoon ground cloves, one teaspoon cinnamon, '/i teaspoon 
grated nutmeg, V/i cup raisins, more fruit if desired; one teaspoon soda 
dissolved IB a little water, one cup unsweetened apple sauce. Put the 
dissolved soda into the sauce, let it foam over the ingredients; 1^ cup 
flour; bake 45 minutes. 

Apricot Shortcake, — Drain the juice away from the fruit, and cut it 
in small pieces. Set tn a warm place and proceed to mix the cake. This 
calls for one ci^iful of flour, four teaspoonfuls of baking powder, two' 
teaspoonfuls of sugar, and half a teaspoonful of salt sifted together. 
Into this work four tablespoon fuls of butter, add three-fourths of a 
cupful of milk, and stir into a light dough. Roll in a floured bowl, and 
when one-fourth of an inch thick cut into generous squares. BriMh. 
the squares with melted butter, lay one on top of the other, and bake in"* 
a hot oven. When done separate the pieces, spread the fruit between the 
layers and on top, and pile whipped cream over all. A sweet sauce which 
may be served with the shortcake is made by adding to a cupful of the 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 93 

fruit juice one tablespoonfu! of cornstarch wet in a little water and 
boiled for a few minutes. A tablespoonfiil of butter is melted into the 
sauce and a tablespoonful of lemon juice is added just before serving. 

Bath Cake, — One cup of sugar, one-half cup of butter, two-thirds of 
a cup of sweet milk, whites of four e^s beaten to a stiff froth, two cups 
of flour, one teaapoonful of baking powder and one-fourth teaspoonful 
of baking soda. Flavor with vanilla. Bake in square, shallow tins (two 
will be required). These cakes should be iced in the tins, while warm, 
and glazed in a hot oven. Then score the icing (without cutting the 
cake or allowing the icing to harden) into two-inch squares, placing in 
the center of each square one-half of an English walnut. Set away 
in tins in a cool place until thoroughly cold, when the squares may be 
cut out. These little cakes look very pretty and are quite a delicacy. 

Black Angel Cake. — One tgg, half a cupful of sweet milk, half i 
cupful of sugar, one-third cake Baker's unsweetened chocolate. Cook 
these ingredients till i( thickens and let cool while making the cake part 
as follows: One e«pful of sugar, half cupful butter creamed, two tgg^ 
beaten separrlely, half cupful sweet milk, two cupfuls flour, half tea- 
spoonful soda in the milk (do not use any cream of tartar), half 
teaspoonful vanilla. Mix the cake thoroughly, then add the chocolate 
paste and beat well. Bake in two layers and put together with white 
icing. This is a delicious cake. 

Black Cake, Inexpensive. — Beat one cup of butter with one cup of 
brown sugar until creamy ; add two well-beaten eggs, one cup of cold 
coffee, three -fourths of a cup of molasses, one cup of seeded raisins, 
one cup of currants, quarter of a pound of citron shredded and a tea- 
spoonful each of ground cloves, allspice and cinnamon sifted with four 
cups of browned flour and two teaspoonfiils of baking powder. Mix 
the fruit in with the butter and sugar instead of flouring it to prevent 
the fruit from sinking when brown flour is used in the cake. A little 
flour may be required to make the batter stiff, as browning the flour 
lessens the thickening property. 

Blackberry Jam Cake. — One and one-quarter cupful of sugar; one- 
half cupful butter; four eggs; four tablespoonfuls of loppespd milk; one 
small teaspoonful soda; two cupfuls flour; one teaspoojiful of cinnamon; 
one quarter cloves and nutmeg. Stir in one cupful of blackberry jam, 
^ake in layers. Put together with a white frosting. 

Blueberry Cakes. — Measure three cupfuls of sifted flour, add three 
tea^oonfuls of baking powder, a heaping tablespoonful of sugar and a 
fespoonful of salt; sift well together. Beat one egg until light; add 
lYi cupful of milk. Make a well in ihe center of the flour and gradually 
pour in the liquid, stirring in the flour. In .this way you can keep the 
batter smooth. Make it to the consistency of cake batter. Melt two 



04 THE, RURAL COOK BOOK. 

level tablespoonfuU of butter^aad add to the batter; then two cupfuls of 
floured blueberries. Rake in the little custard cups or muffin rings, 
allowing a little longer time than for plain muffins. Blackberries are 
nice used in this way. 

Bohemian Butler Kuchen. — Dissolve one cake of dry yeast in a half 
cup of warm milk; then add another cup of warm milk, one and one-half 
cups of fiour, one-halt teaspoon of salt and beat to a smooth batter; let 
rise till very light. Cream together half a cup of bufter, half a cup of 
sugar, two eggs and the grated rind of a lemon. Add this to the sponge 
and enough tlour to make a soft dough. Let rise again to double its 
size; divide into three parts (handle as little as possible). Put each part 
in a shallow buttered pan and let rise again to double its height. Pour 
over each two tablespoonfuls melted butter, sprinkle with three table- 
spoonfuls of sugar and a little cinnamon. Bake 2S minutes. 

Brownie's Cake,— One cupful of brown sugar beaten to a cream with 
half a cupful of butter; add the well-beaten yolks of four eggs and 
half a cupful of strong cold coffee. Ground cloves, cinnamon, allspice

baking powder, and last of all the whites of the eggs beaten to a stiff 
froth and folded in. Bake in two layers and fill in and ice with dark 
caramel icing, made as follows : Put four cupfuls of brown sugar in a 
saucepan with a cupful of sweet cream or rich milk and boil until it will 
thread from a spoon. Take from the fire and beat until nearly cold and 
ihen put between the layers and over the cake. 

Butter Cookies.— Cream together one cupful of butter and one-half 
cupful of light brown sugar; then add one teaspoonful of vanilla and one 
well-beaten egg. Slowly stir in two cupfuls of fiour. Mold lightly with 
the hand. Take out a small portion of the dough each time ; roll as thin 
as a silver dollar, cut the cookies with a cutter no larger than the dollar. 
Bake in a moderate oven until a golden brown. This will make one 
pound and a quarter of rich, crisp cookies. 

Butternut Cake. — Beat half a cup of butter to a cream. Gradually 
beat in J4 of a cup of granulated sugar, and then one cup of butternut 
meats and one egg beaten without separating. Sift together two cups of 
entire wheat flour, one-third of a cup of pastry fiour, one-half teaspoon- 
ful soda, one-fourth teaspoonful salt, one-half teaspoonful mace, one- 
fourth teaspoonful cloves, and H teaspoonful cinnamon. Add this to 
the first mixture alternately with one cup of sour milk. Beat thoroughly 
and turn into little tins fitted with rounds of paper on the bottoms mnd 
thoroughly buttered. Bake about 35 minutes. The recipe makes IB 
cakes. When cold, ice with the icing made of brown sugar, and deco- 
rate with halves of butternut meats. The icing is made as follows : 
Boil one cup of brown sugar and one-third cup of water to 240 de-

cut on a platter and beat until thick enough to spread on the cake. 
While making this frosting have one and one-half square of chocolate 
melting, and after covering the cake with the frosting spread the choco- 
late smoothly over it.

laisins. Mix well and put in a greased pan. Let it rise about three- 
quarters of an hour, or until the loaf is nearly double its original size, 
and bake in a moderate oven. This is very good when fresh; if we wish 
to make it richer we use an fgg, which is mixed in with the butter. Us- 
ing currants instead of raisins, we have the English currant loaf. The 
same recipe makes very nice buns. 

Election Cake. — Rub into half a pound of sifted flour five ounces of 
butter, add a saltspoonful of salt, one cupful of sugar; mix. Scald two 
cupfuls of milk, and when lukewarm add one yeast cake dissolved, and

cream of tartar, one tablespoonful ot cornstarch made smooth in a little 
milk, two cupfuls of flour. Bake in thin sheets and put together with 
boiled sugar frosting, jelly, cocoanut or any other rich filling desired, 
finish the top with the boiled sugar frosting made by boiling together a 
cupful of sugar and one of water until it will turn creamy white and 
thick on being stirred. This is quite as delicious as the frosting made 
from the whites of eggs. 

Noel Fruit Cake.— This contains neither butter nor eggs. One pound 
fat salt pork chopped tine, one cupful brown sugar, one cupful New Or- 
leans molasses in which is dissolved otje teaspoonful of soda, one pound 
each of raisins, currants and figs chopped fine, one-fourth pound of 
citron chopped fine, one wineglass of coffee (substituted for brandy), 
ZYi cupfuls of flour well browned. This will make one large loaf or two 
small ones. The longer kept the better it is. This may be iced or not 
A boiled milk frosting is good while eggs are high.' 

Eggless WafHes. — Mix at night a batter with sour milk if you hart 
it ; if not, sweet will answer. To each quart of milk, with flour for bat- 
ter, add one tablespoonful each of butter and sugar, one-half teaspoonful 
salt. If sweet milk is used add small quantity yeast or one-quarter com- 
pressed yeast cake. In the morning add enough baking soda to correct 
acidity — you will have to try baking a little to get it right. 

Russian Fried Cakes. — Scald one pint of milk, add one scant tea- 
spoonful of salt and one tablespoonful of sugar; when lukewarm add 
one yeast cake dissolved in a liltle warm water, and sufficient flour to 
make a drop batter, and set aside to rise. When light and spongy add 
one-half aipful of butter, creamed together with one cupful of sugar 
and three eggs; beat until thoroughly mixed; add sufficient flour to 
make a soft dough and knead for five minutes. Return to the bowl; 
cover and keep in a warm place until light. Turn out on a floured board; 
roll out quite thin and cut into three-inch circles. On one-half of these 
cakes place a small spoonful of any firm jam or marmalade. Cover with 
the remaining cakes »nd pinch each together securely. Cover with a 
floured cloth, and let stand for 30 minutes; then drop » tew at a time 
into smoking hot fat. When well browned and puffed up draw on un- 
glazed paper and roll in powdered sugar.

Old-Fashioned Fruit Cake.— This is intended for rolling out and bak- 
ing in flat pans, instead of the usual loaf. Take two and a half cupfuls 
of sugar, creamed up with half a cupful of butter, half a cupful of sour 
milk, a teaspoonful of soda, half a teaspoonful each of cinnamon, nut- 
meg and ground cloves, a cupful of raisins and one of currants, with a

the frosting hardens. 

Poor Man's Fruit Cake. — Seed and chop a quarter of a pound of 
dates ; mix with them one cupful of seeded raisins, and dust them with 
one-half cupful of flour. Dissolve a level teaspoonful of baking soda in 
two tahlespoonfuls of warm water; add to it half a pint of very thick 
sour cream, stir a moment and add one cupful of brown sugar, half a 
tumblerful of currant or blackberry jelly, .a tablespoonful of cinnamon, a 
teaspoonful of allspice and two cupfuls and a half of flour. Beat thor- 
oughly, add the fruit, mix well and turn into a greased square pan. Bake 
in a very slow oven for one hour and a half. This cake will be quit'e 
equal to plain fruit cake if the cream is very thick, and it is allowed to 
stand a week before cutting. 

German Cookies.— To one cup of sugar, one cup of butter, one cup 
of lard, one cilji of molasses, the juice and grated rind of one lemon, 
one tablespoonful of vinegar, one teaspoonful each of cinnamon and 
ginger, one and one-half teaspoonful of soda, add one egg, one cup of

half teaspoon of cinnamon. Add the beaten yolks of four eggs, and al- 
ternately with the frothed whites, three even cups of flour sifted twice 
with one teaspoon of baking powder. Beat hard for one minute and 
bake in buttered shallow pans for 45 minutes. Keep covered for 30 
minutes. 

Shiny Gingerbread. — This is very crackly and shiny on top. The 
secret of making it thus is to pour the shortening boiling hot on the 
molasses and beat the batter as little as possible. Pour a small half- 
tcacupful of boiling hot shortening, lard and butter, or beef suet and 
butter mixed, upon one-half pint of New Orleans molasses; add two 
tablespoon fuls of miik, a tablespoonful of ground ginger, a teaspoonful 
of cinnamon; then sift in about three-quarters of a pint of flour, to 
which a tea.=poonful of baking soda has been added ; lastly add a well- 
beaten egg, then mix with a few deft turns of the spoon and bake in one 
targe pan or two small ones in a moderate oven; serve hot, and break, 
net cut, at the table. 

Ginger Snaps. — Beat together one cupful of sugar, one egg, and one 
tablespoonful of ginger. . Heat one cupful of molasses to the scalding 
point, stir into it one teaspoonful of soda or saleratus, and, while it

spoonful of vinegar, and stir in lightly enough flour to roll out and cut 
the dough. 

Half-Pound Cake. — One pound of sugar, one pound of flour, one-half 
pound of butter, one teacupful of milk, four eggs. Flavor to taste. Whip 
up the sugar and eggs, putting in one egg at a time. Then stir in the 
milk and flavoring, following this with the flour, which must be very 
tlioroughly beaten into the butler. Pour into paper-lined tins and bake 
in a steady oven for 45 minutes. This quantity should make two loaves. 
The oven must be well regulated, and care taken to avoid any jar, or 
the cakatWid be apt to fall in the middle. 

Hardenburg . Cake. — This is an old-fashioned Etatch fruit cake. 
Cream together a pound and a half of butter and two pounds of gran- 
ulated sugar. Add one-half pint of New Orleans molasses, the beaten 
yolks of IS eggs, two ounces of mixed spices — mace, cinnamon and 
doves, two grated nutmegs, one-half pound candied peel — two pounds 
rleansed and dried currants, four pounds stoned and cut raisins, one-

h?.lf pint pickled fruit syrup or boiled-down cider, and flour to make the 
ingredients bang togetber. If not self-raising flour, add a dessertspoonful 
of baking powder. About a pound and a quarter of flour will be re- 
quired. Lastly, fold in the stifHy beaten whites of the eggs. Bake three 
or four hours in a moderate even, taking care not to disturb. 

Honey Apple Cake, — Wash two cnpfuls of dried apples (old-fash- 
ioned kind are the best) and soak them over night. Next morning drain 
them and mince as fine as possible and simmer for .two hours in a pint 
of honey. Pour into a bow! and add while hot half a cupful of butler, 
stir until butter is melted and mixed, then let cool. Add a cupful of 
sifted sugar and half a cupful of milk, a teaspoonful each of cloves and 
cinnamon, the grated rind of half a lemon, two eggs well beaten and 
two cupfuls of flour in which you have mixed two teaspoonfuls of baking 
powder. Line long, shallow tins with buttered paper and pour in the 
batter to depth of half an inch. When baked cut into strips size of 
lady fingers and dust the surface with powdered sugar. 

Hot Cross Buns, — Sift into a large bowl one full quart of flour, half 
a cupful of sugar, and half a teaspoonful of salt; dissolve one-fourth 
of a cupful of butter in a generous half-pint of warm milk, and add to 
the dry ingredients, with the yolks of two beaten eggs ; add half a 
yeast cake dissolved in a little water, half a nutmeg grated, and the 
whites of the two eggs, beaten stiff; this should make a very soft dough. 
Cover the bowl with a clean cloth, place it where it will keep warm, 
and let it rise over night. In the morning take pieces of the dough the 
size of an egg and, with a little Hour, mold them into round cakes aii 
inch in thickness. Place them on a buttered tin, leaving a little space 
between. Cover the tins and set in a warm place for the buns to rise; 
they should be double their original size. With a sharp knife cut a 
cross in the center of each bun. Bake them in a moderate oven for 
about half an hour. When the buns are baked, brush the top with a 
syrup made of sugar and water. A few currants or a little candied 
peel is usually added to this recipe. 

Icii^, Plain. — Dissolve one cupful of granulated sugar in one-quarter 
of a cupful of hot water; flavor with essence of vanilla or some orange 
juice and cook until it threads. Then pour it slowly over the whipped 
white of an egg, beatii^ the mixture all the time until cool.

into a pound and a half of flour and half a pound of sugar. Flavor with 
grated nutmeg, cinnamon or lemon extract, and add three well beaten 
eggs. Work all well together into a smooth paste and roll out an eighth 
of an inch in thickness. Sprinkle crushed loaf sugar over it and cut into 
round cakes with a very small cutter; take out the center. Lay on bak- 
ing sheets and bakfe in a quick oven, without browning, about 10 minutes.

soured milk, one cupful of sugar, a half teaspoonful of soda, saltspoonful 
of salt, the same of nutmeg and cinnamon mixed, the grated yellow rind 
of half a lemon, and a teaspoonful of lemon juice, two cupfuls of flour 
to stiffen. Bake in rings in a hot oven. A cupful of clean, light, new- 
fallen snow stirred into cake, or other batters, briskly, the very last thing 
before turning it into the baking pan, is a good substitute for e^s. When 
snow is used a little more flour is required — about two tablespoon fuls. 

Lady Baltimore Cake. — One cupful of butter, two cupfuls of sugar, 
three and one-half cupfuls of flour, one cupful sweet milk, the whites 
of six eggs, two level teaspocnfuls of baking powder and a teaspoonful

yolks of three eggs until light and thick and add to the whites, putting 
in at the same time a little vanilla extract. Fold in one-third of a cup 
of flour. Shape on a buttered tin to resemble those sold in the shops; 
Ihat is, make them very thin and about four and one-half inches long by 
one inch wide. Dust with confectioner's sugar and bake in a moderate 
oven. About eight minutes will be required for the baking. 

Lebkuchen. — Take a cupful of butter and one of sugar, pour over them 
two cupfuls of honey heated to the boiling point. Add a generous handful 
of blanched almonds, a grated nutmeg and a teaspoonful of cinnamon.

ter and stir speedily till it will spread on the cake. Add one<half tea- 
spoonful of vanilla and put between the layers. 

Molasses Cookies.^Take one cupful of sugar and one cupful of but- 
ter or good shortening. Cream them and add two cups of molasses and 
two eggs. Dissolve two good-sized teaspoonfuls of soda in a little hot 
water, and fill up the cup it is in with cold water. Add it to the other 
mixture and stir in enough flour to make a soft dough, but one that can 
be rolled out and cut into cookies. Spice to suit the taste. 

Delicious Nut Cake. — Cream half a cupful of sugar, adding the stiffly 
beaten whites of three eggs and beating very light ; then add, by alter- 
nate bits, two-thirds of a cupful of milk and one and a half cupfuls of 
flour mixed with two level teaspoonfuls of baking powder. At the last 
turn in a cupful of minced English walnut meat and bake in a shallow 
tin. When the cake is cool cover with icing, mark in squares and put 
nut meat on the top of each. 

Nut Wafers, — Two eggs, one cup of sugar, two tablespoon fuls of 
flour, one cup of nut meats chopped fine. Hickorynuts are preferred, 
and the sugar should be light brown. Spread the mixture in a very thin 
layer on a well-greased tin and bake ten minutes or until well tinged 
with brown. Cut in squares and remove from the tin as soon as they are 
done, that the wafer.!! may grow crispy in the air. 

Oatmeal Cookies.— Cream three-fourths of a cupful of butter with one 
c;upful of sugar; add two well-beaten eggs. Sift three-fourths of a tea- 
spoonful of soda into two cupfuls of flour; add one-half a teaspoonful

baking powder well mixed with the oats ; two eggs, well beaten, one- 
half teaspoon of salt and two teaspoons vanilla in the eggs. Mix in the 
order given ; bake in a medium to slow oven. A heaping teaspoonful of 
mixture makes a dainty crisp. Allow room for them to spread in the 
pan. If you cannot get on without flour use a little best bread flour- 
not pastry.

cupful of water, stirring constantly. When very thick pour boiling-hot 
over the beaten whites of two eggs. Beat until almost cold. Flavor 
with rose extract and color with cochineal. Put the cakes together with 
this icing. For the pink coloring matter, buy five cents' worth of baker's 
cochineal of the druggist, put half a teaspoonful into a cup and cover

and a pinch of salt Butter liberally a number of shallow tins. Hake 
a tester by dropping a teaspoonful of the mixture on a greased pan and

baking it in a hot oven. This is necessary, as with some brands of flour 
a trifle more may be indicated. The mixture will spread very much and 
when lakgi from the oven the cake will be as thin as a wafer and should 
be taken at once from the pan. 

Berwic)^ Sponge Cake. — Six eggs ; powdered white sugar, three cup- 
fiils; sifted flour, tour even cupfuls; cream of tartar, two teaspoonf uls ; 
soda, one teaspoonf ul ; one cupful cold water, one-half of a lemon. 
First beat the eggs two minutes, add the sugar and beat five minutes more, 
then stir the cream of tartar in two cupfuls of the flour and beat one 
minute; dissolve the soda in the water and add; wash the lemon dry, 
then grate the rind and squeeze in the juice. Finally, add the remaining 
two cupfuls of flour and beat all one minute. Put into deep pans in a 
moderate oven. This will make two bars, or loaves. When it is done 
it smells like fresh popcorn. There is considerable beating about this 
cake, and therein lies the success. You can use three tablespoonfuls 
baking powder (if you wish, in place of cream of tartar anJ soda), but 
sift it in the two last cupfuls of flour. Have about the same heat as 
for raised bread, put into the oven and let it remain certainly 20 min- 
utes without looking at it. If it can bake until done without the oven 
door being opened, so much the better. 

Boiled Sponge Cake. — One and one-half cupful granulated sugar, two- 
thirds cupful water, boiled until clear; pour over (beating while you 
pour) the whites of five eggs which have been beaten very stiff in a large 
platter ; now beat until cold, and add yolk of eggs beaten smooth, juice 
of a half lemon and one cupful of flour folded in gently. Bake in a slow 
oven about three-fourths hour. Bake in oblong pan about two to 2J4 
inches deep. Can be iced with any icing preferred, and will keep in- 
definitely. 

Never-Fail Sponge Cake. — This can be made and baked in 35 min- 
utes. A good sponge should be yellow as gold, of velvety softness and 
tender as a marshmallow. If the rule here given is strictly followed, 
such a cake will be the sure result ; Separate the whites and yolks of 
four eggs. Beat the whites until stiff enough to remain in bowl if it n 
inverted, then beat into them one-half cup of sugar, which must be fine 
g:ranalated (powdered sugar makes tough cake and proper beating does 
away entirely with the grains). Beat the yolks, add to them one-half 
cupful of sugpr, beating for five minutes by the clock— this latter being 
important, as the delicate texture of the cake depends upon it; add to 
the yolks the grated rind and juice of one lemon. Now beat well to- 
gether the yolks and white. At this stage beating is in order, but must 
be absolutely avoided after adding the flour, of which take one cupful. 
The mixture should now look like a puff ball, and the flour is to be 
tossed or stirred into it with a light turn of the wooden spooa Stirring

is quite different from beating. The cupful'of sugar must be generous, 
the flour scanty. Bake for 25 minutes in a moderate oven. Just be- 
fore putting in the oven sprinkle on top through a sifter about a table- 
spoonful of granulated sugar. This gives the "erackly" top Wust so 
desirable. 

Tory Wafers.— Melt a teacup oMnitter, a half a cup of lard, and mix 
them with a quart of flour, a couple of beaten eggs, a teaspoonful of 
salt, and flavoring. Add milk till of the right consistency to roll out; 
roll it out about the third of an inch in thickness, cut it into cakes with 
a cookie cutter, lay them on buttered baking plates, and bake them a 
few minutes. Frost them as soon as baked, and sprinkle comfits or 
sugar sand on the toii. 

Venetian Cake.— This makes a handsome loaf, and is very good. 
Beat together the yolks of six e^s and half a pint of sugar for 20 
minutes. Fold in the stiffly beaten whites and mix in lightly i^A 
rounded tablespoon fuls of flour. Pour into a buttered mold dusted 
with equal parts of flour and sugar. Bake half an hour, with an increas- 
ing heat, putting it into a moderate oven at first. When done invert it 
on the pastry rack, and when cold frost with a vanilla chocolate icing. 

Walnut Cafce.^ — Cream two-thirds of a cupful of butter with one 
cupful of sugar. Separate three eggs ; beat the yolks until creamy and 
add to butter and sugar; then add one cupful of milk alternating with 
three cupfuls of flour (reserve enough of the flour for the nuts), add two 
teaspoonfuls of baking powder, one cupful of nut kernels chopped, and 
last of all fold in the whites of the e^s beaten to a stiff froft. Bake 
in a loaf tin in a moderate oven from 45 minutes to one hour. 

Walnut Wafers, — One cup brown sugar, one cup chopped nuts, two 
eggs, one tablespoon butter, flour enough to make very thick dough 
(about eight tablespoon fuls), one teaspoon baking powder, vanilla. Beat 
sugar and yolks together, add nuts, butter and flour ; lastly the whites 
beaten stiff and baking powder. Drop by one-half teaspoonful on but- 
tered tins, allowing room to spread. Bake in quick oven. 

Whigs. — Mix half a pound of sugar with six ounces of butter, a 
couple of beaten eggs, a teaspoonful of cinnamon. Stir in two pounds 
of flour, a teacup of yeast, and milk sufficient to make a thick batter. 
When light, bake tbem in small cups. 

White Fruit Cake.— The whites of 16 eggs, one pound each of sugar, 
flc-ur and butter, one grated cocoanut, one pound chopped 'citron, one 
pound chopped blanched almonds, one wineglass of rose water, two tea- 
spoonfuls of baking powder. Flour citron and almonds well ; bake care- 
fully.

CHAPTER IX. 

E^rs a la Bonne Femmc— Cut an onion into fine dice, fry it lightly in 
a tablespoontul of butter, then dash in a teaspoonful of vinegar. But- 
ter a shallow dish, sprinkle the fried onion over it, and break in five 
eggs, being very careful that the yolks remain whole. Bake in a hot 
oven until the whites become a delicate film. EHist with salt and white 
pepper. Just before sending to the table sprinkle all over the dish 
coarse bread crumbs fried delicately brown in butter, and garnish with 
watercress or parsley. 

A la Maitre d'Hotel. — Put the eggs in boiling water and boil six 
minutes ; then take from the fire and dip in cold water, taiing them 
out immediately; this is to render shelling easy. When shelle^ cut the 
eggs through lengthwise and lay them on a hot dish on whic^ maitre 
d'hotel butter has been melted. With a 5poon cover the eggs with this 
sauce, which is made as follows: Mix with a spoon on a plate a piece 
of butter the size of an egg with a tablespoonful of finely chopped par- 
sley, a pinch of salt, and pepper. Put it on a hot platter to melt This 
sauce is often served with fish, broiled meat or boiled vegetables. It is 
very nice with new potatoes. E^gs boiled as above described arc also 
very good with strained tomato, or parsley sauce, while another varia- 
tion is given by using black butter, sauce au beurre noir. To make this, 
brown half a cupful of butter in the frying pan as brown as it can be 
made without burning, then add two tablespoonfuls of vinegar, salt and 
pepper. This sauce is very good with fish also. 

Baked ^gs. — One large cupful of milk, add one teaspoonful of but- 
'cr (or more if wished), salt and pepper to taste, one teaspoonful of 
fiour, made smooth with a little extra milk. Boil about three minutes 
and pour in heated dish, then break in five fresh eggs and put in hot 
oven and bake until whites of eggs are set. 

Baked Eggs with Cheese. — Cut 12 hard boiled eggs in thick slices, 
and, having a buttered baking dish well sprinkled with dry crumbs, place 
a layer of eggs in the center. Sprinkle with grated cheese- and season 
lightly with salt and paprika. Add, another layer of eggs and cheese 
until the dish is filled, finishing with the cheese. Pour in a cream sauce 
thickened with the yolks of three e^s, sprinkle with fresh bread crumbs 
mixed with cheese, dot with butter and bake about 10 minutes in a hot 
even, or until the trumbs arp a golden yello^, Serve at once 



110 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Baked Eggs With Mashed Potatoes. — The potatoes should be well sea- 
soned, and beaten smooth with hot cream or milk and butter, so the; 
will be very, light. Put in a buttered baking dish, and then •with a 
small croquette mold (or if this >s lacking, with a clean egg) make 
deep little hollows in the potatoes. Drop an uncooked egg •arefuUy 
into each of these hollows, dust with salt and pepper, and dot the ftop 
with bits of butter; set in the oven until the eggs are cooked, and serve 
at once. 

Creamed Eggs- — Boil six eggs for about eight minutes. Cool, remove 
shells, and cut into halves. Put two tablespoon fuls of butter in a 
saucepan and blend with the same amount of floor. Add a cup of 
water and stir until smooth. Put in some more butter, season with salt 
and pepper and a little lemon juice. Stir in the eggs and serve on toast. 

Eggs in Cream. — Use very thick cream, a dessert spoonful to each egg 
to cook them in. Put the cream in a large deep granite ware pie dish 
and set on top of the stove for a minute or two, until the cream gets thin. 
Then break in the eggs ; sprinkle a little salt and white pepper over 
each egg, set the dish back on the stove, cover close and let stand two 
or three minutes, or until the eggs are nicely set. These are most de- 
licious served with toast and coffee for breakfast. 

Mexican Eggs. — Peel and chop four or five ripe tomatoes and lay 
them in a shallow vegetable dish or on a platter on which the peppers 
are to be served. Remove the stems and seeds from six or eight very 
tender peppers, and if desired, the skins can be peeled off in this way. 
Put them into a dry frying pan over a moderate fire, moving them 
often until they are sufficiently wilted to allow the removal of the skins. 
This done, put a small bit of cheese in each pepper and return them to 
the pan with a good lump of butter. Fry them gently so the butter will 
not scorch. When done pour three well-beaten eggs slightly salted into 
the pan with the peppers and when set take them up by the spoonful — 
a pepper in each — and lay them on the chopped tomatoes. 

Omelets. — It is always better to make several small omelets than one 
large one, if a number of persons are to be served. It is much more 
likely to turn out well. Nearly everyone has her own special recipe for 
this dish; the regulation French omelet calls tor three eggs well beaten, 
to which three tablespoon fuls of water are added, and stirred in lightly. 
A level tablespoonful of butter is melted in a perfectly smooth frying 
pan and the omelet turned in; it is shaken gently to prevent sticking, 
and when cooked rolled over with a flexible knife and slid on to a hot 
dish. It is varied by putting in a filling before rolling over; half a cup 
of grated cheese is very nice, or some jam or jelly for a sweet omelet, 
which makes a rich dessert Some coojfs stir 9 liltle flour iirto (be first 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. ill 

egg beaten, and separate the eggs, folding in the beaten whites last; 
this makes a very light and puffy omelet 

Buttermilk Omelet. — Four eggs beaten separately, one cupful of but- 
termilk, one-half teaspoonful of soda, three-quarters cup of finely rolled 
cracker crumbs, a scant teaspoonful of salt, one-eighth of a teaspoonful 
of pejfper. Have two tablespoon fuls of butter hot in a frying pan. 
Turn in omelet and fry a delicate brown. Place in oven for 10 minutes 
and when firm fold and serve. 

Faiiy Omelet.— Beat yolks and whites of six eggs separately; add five 
tablespoon fuls of milk to the yolks. Heat a skillet and put in a table- 
spoonful of butter; let it melt, pour in the beaten yolks and pile be- 
tween whites on the top; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cover and 
cook three minutes, slip out on hot platter and serve by cutting through 
yolks and whites. 

French Omelet. — Beat thoroughly, first, the yolks and then the whites 
of the eggs; to the yolks add a tablespoonful of boiling water, a pinch 
of salt and a dash of pepper; turn the stiff whites into the yolks and 
fold; that is, stir them in so that the air bubbles shall not be broken. 
Turn carefully into a frying pan, in which has been melted a large 
piece of butter. Set where it may cook very slowly, and when well 
browned on one side set in the oven to brown on the other. Send im- 
mediately to the table. The omelet may be varied by dropping chopped 
meat in it, chopped celery, grated cheese, or, if a sweet omelet is de- 
sired, by spreading jelly over and folding. 

Orange Omelet. — Beat yolks of three eggs ; add three tablespoonfuls 
of sugar and the grated rind of one orange; add a pinch of salt to the 
whites of the eggs and beat until stiff; mix the whites lightly with the 
yolks, sprinkling in at the same time three tablespoonfuls of orange 
juice ; melt one teaspoonful of butter in a clean, small frying pan till 
the bottom is greased; turn in the egg mixture; cook slowly, turning 
the pan that the bottom may brown evenly; when firm OR the bottom 
put pan in a hot oven; fold in half and turn out on a hot platter; 
sprinkle over powdered sugar. 

Pannikins. — Take some little earthen pans, such as are sold for toy 
milk pans, capable of holding one egg only; heat them in the oven, and 
when quite hot take them out, and with a paste brush butter them in- 
side; break an eg^ carefully into each pan; set them into the oven until 
the white of the egg is hard enough to retain the form of the pan; turn 
them out in a circle on the dish in which they are to be served. On the 
top of each sprinkle a little fresh parsley or grated ham; have ready a 
sauce of bread crumbs beaten up with rich gravy, browned and seasoned; 
place this in the center of the dish, the eggs inclosing it.

Asparagus. — The average cook rarely tries any other mode than boil- 
ing. Boil the stalks whole, after careful washing, tying in a bundle to 
keep from breaking; drain, lay upon toast, and serve with cream sauce. 
Another way is to cut in inch lengths, and stew in milk, thickening with 
flour, and seasoning with butter, pepper and salt. 

Asparagus a la Vinaigrette. — Cock as for boiled asparagus. While 
cooking make a hot French dressing by mixing together in a saucepan 
over the fire six tablespoonfuls of salad oil, two of vinegar, two tea- 
spoonfuls of French mustard, half a teaspoonful of sugar, salt and pep- 
per to taste. When the asparagus is tender drain, put in a deep dish 
and pour over it the hot dressing. Cover and set aside to cool, then 
stand in the ice chest for an liour or so before serving. 

Baked Beans with Cream. — Soak and parboil a pint of navy beans 
until half cooked; drain, dash over a quart of cold water, drain again 
Jnd add the last water (boiling) with two heaping teaspoonfuls of salt, 
one-eighth teaspoonful pepper, one large sprig of thyme (minced), two 
tablespoonfuls of beef drippings or the clean, browned trimmings of fat 
from roast beef, and fried steak may be used instead of the drippings ; 
when beans are cooked tender turn all into a covered bean pot and 
bake in a very moderate oven five hours. Then pour over the beans a 
cupful of sweet cream and bake an hour longer. 

Baked Beans and Tomato Sauce. — Prepare the beans as for ordinary 
baking, by soaking and parboiling; then put in a crock, with the pork, 
and add the sauce, which should be prepared while the beans are cook- 
ing. Some cooks merely use the juice from a can of tomatoes; we pre- 
fer to use some of the solid iiart, too. Stew slowly, put through a sieve 
to make it smooth, and flavor with salt, pepper, a small pinch of clove, 
a little mustard, and, if desired, a shred of onion. Do not thicken; pour 
this over the beans, cover and bake. Add a little water from time to 
time if the beans seem to be becoming too dry. A little sugar may be 
added to the sauce if the family taste approves. 

Siring Beans and Bacon. — Cut one or two slices of tender mild-cured 
bacon in tiny cubes and cook to a delicate brown in the frying pan. 
Add a pint of hot cooked and drained string beans and a few drops of 
onion juice. Shake the frying pan thoroughly. Add salt and pepper as 
needed and turn into a hot dish. Peas may be served in the san^wity.

Lyonnaise Beets.— Two cupfuls of boiled beets cut into half-inch 
dice, three tablespoon fuls of vinegar, one lablespoonful of butter, one 
tablespoon of chopped parsley, one-fourth of a teaspoonful of salt, half 
the quantity of pepper. Put all of the ingredients except the beets into 
a double boiler. When well heated add the beets, stir for a few min- 
utes that they may absorb the dressing and serve very hot 

Baked Summer Cabbage. — Cut into quarters and boil tender in salt 
and water two medium-sized heads of cabbage, drain and chop. Ar- 
range an inch layer in the bottom of a baking dish. Sprinkle with black 
pepper, then crumb in a layer of stale bread. Drop sniall bits of butter 
over the bread crumbs. Repeat the process until the dish is nearly full, 
bread coming on top. Then pour over the whole one pint of rich milk 
or thin cream, and bake until nicely browned. 

Baked Cabbage With Cheese.— Boil a firm white cabbage for 15 min- 
utes in salted water, then change the water for more that is boiling, and 
boil until tender. Drain and when cool chop fine. Butter a baking 
Jish, and lay in the chopped cabbage. Put one tablespoonful of butter 
m a frying pan ; when it bubbles stir in one tablespoonful of flour, one 
half-pint of stock, same of boiling water; stir until smooth. Then 
season with saltspoonful salt, half as much pepper, four tablespoon fuls 
grated cheese. Pour over the cabbage, sprinkle cracker crumbs over the 
top, dot with bits of butter and bake in a quick oven 10 minutes. 

Browned Cabbage. — One small cabbage, one tablespoonful of buttter, 
half a cupful of milk, two eggs and bread crumbs. Cut the cabbage into 
small pieces and remove the hard center. Wash the pieces in cold wa- 
ter; then pour boiling water over them and let stand for 10 minutes. 
Drain off the hot water and put the cabbage in boiling salted water to 
cook until tender. When it is done pour off the water, pressing down 
hard on the cabbage, to be sure that all the water has been drained away. 
Chop as fine as possible, beat up the eggs, add the milk and stir all the 
ingredients and seasoning with the cabbage. Put the whole into a but- 
tered baking dish and bake for one hour in a moderate oven. 

Red Cabbage, German Style. — Slice red cabbage thin, cover with 
cold water, and let soak 20 minutes; then drain. Put one quart in a stew 
pan with two tablespoon fuls of butter, one-half teaspoonful of salt, oae 
tablespoonful of finely chopped onion and a few gratings each of nut- 
meg and cayenne. Cover, and cook until the cabbage is tender; then 
add two tablespoontuls of vinegar and one-half tablespoonful of sugar, 
and cook five minutes. 

Carrot Ragout. — Clean and scrape enough new carrots to measure a 
pint; lake the same quantity of new potatoes and white turnips, catting 
them in pieces about the size of the carrots. Cut a half cupful of leeks 
in^Pe $|i?es. Cgok the carrots in boiling: water for half an hour and tbe

other vegetables separately tor 10 minules. In a frying pan brown 
slowly together two tablespoon fuls each of butter or dripping and flour; 
add gradually one pint of stook or water and stir until thick and smooth. 
Season with a level t^lespoonlul of sugar, one teaspoonful of salt and 
one-quarter of a teaspoonful of white pepper, add the vegetables, cover 
and simmer gently for half an hour, and before serving stir into it a 
tablespoonfiil of parsley. 

Baked Corn. — One quart corn scraped from cob ; one and one-third 
cupful cream; one heaping tabiespoonful of butter; season with salt 
and pepper. Bake one hour. 

Baked Com and Tomatoes. — RIl an earthen pudding dish with alter- 
nate layers of com and tomatoes, each about an inch thick. Season each 
with salt, pepper and butter. When the dish is full sprinkle with grated 
bread crumbs and bits of butter. Cover the dish with a plate and bake 
in a moderately hot oven for 20 minutes. Then remove the cover and 
bake 15 minutes longer. * 

Corn Chowder. — Cut the kernels from a dozen ears of green com. 
Peel and mince two onions and fry them brown in threle Jiablespoonfuls 
of butter in a deep saucepan. Now put in the corn, four broken pilot 
biscuits, add a half dozen parboiled and sliced potatoes. Season with 
pepper, salt and a tabiespoonful of minced parsley, and cover with a 
quart of boiling water. Let all cook gently for three-quarters of an hour, 
tlien stir in slowly a cupful of boiling milk, thickened with a tabiespoon- 
ful of flour rubbed into one of butter. Turn at once into a heated tureen. 

Escalloped Com. — Into a buttered dish put a layer of green corn pulp, 
sprinkling with salt and bits of butter. Over this spread a layer of 
cracker crumbs, seasoned and moistened slightly with inilk. Fill the dish 
with alternate layers of corn and cracker crumbs, with crackers for top 
layer and plenty of milk over the whole. Cover and bake one hour. 

Hulled Corn. — New England taste demands a well-ripened white flint 
corn for hulling, other sections prefer yellow, but it is always flint corn. 
Babbitt's potash is used to remove the hulls, the proportion being one 
full pound to a bushel of corn. Of course, when preparing corn for 
home use, the same proportion would be observed in smaller quantities. 
An iron kettle half filled with water is put on the stove, the potash added 
when the water warms, and the corn put in when it comes to a boil. In 
about an hour the Starch will come out of the corn, thickening the lye. 
The corn must be well stirred from the bottom, to avoid burning, and 
the kettle kept back on the stove, so the corn will simmer without boiling 
hard. After the first hour corn must be dipped out and tested in cold 
water, to see if the hulls slip. If left in the potash too long it becomes 
dark and sodden ; it too short, it cannot be cooked ten4er. About 1J4 
two hours is the usual time. The corn is til?!) ^fashe^ in cUar watl

THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 117 

When made in large quantities a clean, new broom, with about six inches 
of the straw clit off, is used to rub off the hulls; a stiff whisk wonld 
answer the same purpose with small quantities. A quantity of water will 
be used during this scrubbing, the hulls being poured off with the water. 
Put the corn on to boil in' clear water; when it reaches the boiling point 
draw it back, so that it may simmer. It should not be stirred, as this 
makes it mushy. It requires long, slow simmering; when sufficiently 
cooked it may be salted to taste, and drained in a colander. When 
served it is either eaten with milk, or warmed up with butter in a frying 
pan, and served like a vegetable. In the Summer hulled com would 
ferment very quickly, so its manufacture takes place only after hard freez- 
ing has started in the Fall. 

Hulled com may al^o be prepared as follows : Wash two quarts of 
shelled com to remove loose bits; then place in a large iron kettle with 
two heapine tablespoons of saleratus, cover with cold water, let comt 
to a boil slowly and cook about an hour. Remove the kettle from fire, 
drain off the water, then pour the corn, from which the hulls will already 
be loosened, into a large pan of water. Rub the com between the hands 
to loosen the hulls ; after taking off all those partly loosened put it on 
again in warm water, let boil about half an hour, then try to remove 
the rest of the hulls by rubbing as before. After- all hulls are removed, 
wash the corn in at least half a dozen clear waters, then put on once 
more in warm water, and when it boils drain and add fresh water. Let 
the corn cook in this last water until tender, salting to taste. If the 
hulls do not come off readily let the corn boil an hour longer, adding a 
teaspoon more saleratus. 

Corn Pudding. — Two coffeecupfuls of green corn pulp, one cupful of 
new milk, three eggs, two heaping tablespoonfuls of butter. Pour one 
pint of the milk over the corn and set on the Sre until scalding hot. Beat 
the yolks of the eggs and add the pint of cold milk and half a cuplul of 
sugar. Put the butter in the corn over the fire, and then add the milk 
and yolks of eggs and a little salt. Put in a buttered pudding dish and 
bake slowly. Make a meringue of the whites of the eggs and powdered 
sugar and spread over the top when pudding is done, browning slightly. 

Succotash. — Cook one pint of com pulp in as little water as you can 
without scorching. Put the cobs in a quart of water and boil hard for 
20 minutes ; remove cobs and in this water boil one pint of shelled beans 
until tender-; drain and mix with the com. Add butter the size of a 
walnut, pepper, salt and half a cupful of thick cream, more if liked. 
Serve hot. 

Baked Egg Plant. — Select one that is firm and fresh, peel it and. cut 
it into quarters. Let it lie half an hour in salted water. Put it into boil- 
ing»ater with a teaspoonful of salt. Cook until it can be easily picrce4 



118 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

with a fork. While the plant is cookii^ cut one medium-sized omon 
into small pieces and cover it with salt water. In 10 minutes pour off the 
water and put the chopped onion into a hot pan, with a tablespoonful of 
butter. Cook until it is thoroughly tender and brown. Drain the egg 
plant in a colander, put into a bowl, stir with a silver fork until it is 
broken up, but not mashed. Mix with it an equal quantity of rolled 
bread crumbs, add the browned onion and one well-beaten egg. Season 
with a dash of salt, two dashes of pepper, and add a dessertspoonful of 
butter. Put the mixture into a well-buttered earthen dish, bake just 
long enough to be nicely browned. Serve hot in the dish in which it is 
baked. 

Dutch Hutspot.— Boil six carrots with six onions (medium size) one 
hour, or until tender. In another kettle boil six medium-sized potatoes 
until done. Drain all the water from both, put them together, mash them 
well, add one teaspoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful of sugar, one- 
quarter teaspoonful of pepper, one-half cupful of butter and one-half 
cupful of milk or cream. Beat well and serve hot 

Macaroni and Gieese. — The macaroni is first put into boiling salted 
water and cooked tender— a half hour or less — then it is drained, and 
rinsed with cold water, and cut in convenient pieces. A buttered pudding 
dish is then filled with alternate layers of the macaroni and chopped or 
grated cheese, perhaps a cupful of the cheese to a quart of the cooked 
macaroni. Season with salt and pepper, fill the dish with milk, and cover 
with bread or cracker crumbs mixed with a little melted butter and bake 
in a moderate oven for nearly an hour, or till the macaroni absorbs most 
of the milk. 

Macaroni, Italian Style, — Four tablespoon fuls of butter, one-half 
pound of macaroni, an onion, parsley, herbs, tomato catsup and spice. 
Put in a pan one tablespoonful each of finely-chopped onion, parsley and 
rosemarj; fry in bubbling butter until well browned; add four table- 
spoonfuls of tomato catsup, some mixed spice, four tablespoon fuls of 
butter and one quart of boiling water; put in macaroni broken into 
medium-sized pieces ; frequently shake the pan and stew over a slow fire 
until the macaroni is tender. Arrange on a hot dish, pouring the sauce 
over. Sprinkle thickly with grated cheese. 

Okra, Creole Style. — Wash, trim and cut into slices a quart of young, 
tender okra; place in a granite saucepan two teaspoonfuls of butter, a 
medium-sized onion', a medium-si7ed green pepper, both minced" fine; stir 
over the fire until a golden brown, then add three large tomatoes peeled 
and cut into pieces, three tablespoonfuls of Spanish or some hot pepper 
sauce ^nd salt to taste, and the okra. Cover the saucepan and simmer 
gently for half an hour. Turn out on a hot dish and sprinkle OVCT with 
^ teaspoonful of minced parslejr and serve. Jh

Baked Onions. — Peel and cut in thick slices lai^ white onions. Par- 
boil in plenty of salted water, drain well, arrange in a buttered baking 
dish, dot with bits of butter and bake until soft and a pale yellow. 
Sprinkle with salt and pepper and cover with a half-inch layer of grated 
crumbs thickly dredged with grated cheese. Return to -the oven long 
enough to melt the cheese. 

Escalloped Onions. — Slice some onions and cook in salted water until 
done, drain and put layers of onion and cracker crumbs seasoned with 
salt, pepper and butter in pudding dish; moisten with milk. Bake 20 to 
30 minutes. 

Baked Split Peas.— Rub a large baking dish with onion. Turn into 
this a pint of split peas soaked until soft. Chop a large onion very fine 
and spread over the top of the peas with pepper and salt If you have 
left over gravy or stock pour it over the mixture. If not, cover with 
water, spreading over all bacon cut into the thinnest possible slices. Bake 
in the oven for two hours and add a little boiling water if the peas get 
too dry. 

French Fried Potatoes.— Old potatoes are better for this, .or the little 
yellowish potatoes that German cooks use for potato salad. These con- 
tain more gluten. Peel very thin and cut in long thin strips lengthwise. 
Let them stand in cold salted water for two or three hours. Drain and 
wipe dry; put into a wire basket and fry in very hot, deep fat until brown. 
Take out and lay on a piece of manila paper to absord the fat; dust with 
salt and serve. Another way to fry potatoes is to put a little olive oil tn 
a deep frying pan; when very hot add sliced cold boiled potatoes. Cover, 
and cook until a golden brown, turning once. Drain, put in a hot vege- 
table dish and sprinkle with salt, pepper and lemon juice. Still another 
way, that the French chef delights in, is to chop cold boiled potatoes, then 
season lightly with salt, pepper and onion juice. Put a couple of table- 
spoonfuls of olive oil or good drippings in the frying pan, turn in the 
potatoes, press into a solid cake and cook slowly until crusty and brown 
on the under side. Turn on to a hot platter, with the brown side upper- 
Potatoes au Gratin. — Peel and cut into dice half a dozen potatoes, 
crisp in cold water, then drain, and boil until tender. Drain the water 
off, put the potatoes in a baker, season with pepper and salt, stir a table- 
spoonful of butter through the pieces, pour over them half a cup of milk, 
cover the top with grated cheese, bake quickly and serve hot. 

Potato Chowder. — Wash and pare four large potatoes. Cut them 
into small dice. Chop fine one-quarter of a pound of ham and one good- 
sized onion. Slowly fry the ham and onion together until a light brown, 
then in a saucepan put alternate layers of the ham and diced potato, 
( well with lalt and pepper. Add one tablespoonftil of finely- 



180 THE RVRAL COOK BOOK. 

chopped parsley and one pint of boiling water, cover and ainuner slowly 
until the potatoes are tender, which will take about twenty minutes. In 
a second saucepan thicken two cupfuls of milk with one tablespoon ful 

of butter, and one tablespoonful of Bour, simmer for a moment, add it 
to the chowder and let cook for two minutes longer. 

Potato Dumplings .—Boil six large potatoes and mash, seasoning with 
one-half teaspoonful salt. Place on a board. Add to this one egg and 
one-half cupful flour; knead into a dough. Roll out into strips, one-half 
inch thick, and cut into inch lengths. Sprinkle the pieces with tlour, so 
that they are quite dry. Place enough of the dumplings in a saucepan 
of boiling water to allow them freedom to swim, and allow them to boil 
about eight minutes. Remove the dumplings from the water, with a 
perforated spoon, to a hot frying pan, in which one cupful bread crumbs 
have been browned in about two tablespoon fuls butter. All of the dump- 
lings can be placed in the pan at the same time. They should be stirred 
from time to time, until nicely browned, keeping a small fire under the 
pan. Serve hot. 

German Sour Potatoes. — Boil four good-sized potatoes. When done 
and cold, skin, and cut into cubes. Place these in a bowl and add salt 
and pepper to taste. Now mix in another bow] half a pint of sweet oil 
and four tablespoonfuls of sweet cider vinegar, one good-sized onion, 
grated fine and sprigs of parsley finely chopped. Mix these together well 
and pour over the potatoes. Now place the empty bow! on top of the 
full one and shake up and down until well mixed. Garnish the dish with 
lemon slices, cut in halves. 

Hashed Brown Potatoes. — Cut or chop finely a. quart of cold baked 
or boiled potatoes and put them down in a frying pan in which has been 
dissolved a tablespoonful of butter and an equal quantity of tried-out suet 
or beef dripping. Let the potatoes simmer in this and season with pepper 
and salt; have the pan covered. When the potatoes seem rich and moist 
throughout and browned underneath add a sprinkling of finely-minced 
parsley and with a large, flexible knife loosen the potatoes from the bot- 
tom of the pan, turning the sides over toward the middle as in making 
an omelet, and slip them carefully on to the serving dish. For a pint of 
potatoes use half the quantity of butter and drippings. 

Lyonnaise Potatoes. — Put lyi tablespoonful of butter in a frying pan; 
when melted add a scant tablespoonful of chopped onion; let it slightly 
color, then add two cupfuls of cold boiled potatoes cut into dice. Stir 
until the potato has absorbed all the butter and become slightly browned; 
then sprinkle with salt, pepper and a tablespoonful of chopped parsley. 
Mix well and serve very hot. 

Scalloped Potatoes. — Peel and slice very thin one medium-sized potato 
for each perion to be served, and allow the slices to remain in cold water*

till crisp. Prepare as you would scalloped oysters with cracker cnunbs 
and salt and pepper sprinkled over each layer, and small dots of butter. 
Cover the top of the pan with crumbs and carefully pour on sweet milk 
almost to cover without disturbing the cracker crumbs. Bake two hours 
and a half in a steady oven, removing cover from pan during last half 
hour. It is better to use your thickest, heaviest kettle cover or earthen- 
ware pie pan for the first hour in the oven. 

Spaghetti witli Brown Sauce. — Put a half pound of spaghetti into 
slightly-salted boiling water. Boil half an hour, drain and pour into a 
buttered granite pan. Pour over it the following brown sauce: Heat 
three tablespoon fuls butter, stir into this two tablespoontuls flour, stir 
til] smooth. Draw to a cooler place on the stove and add gradually one 
cupful cold water, stirring constantly. Let it boil up, add one scant tea- 
spoonful salt, one-fourth teaspoonful pepper, one teaspoontul of catsup, 
simmer two or three minutes, pour over spaghetti, set it into the oven 
and let it bake 10 or IS minutes. 

Squash Puff. — Press dry cooked squash through a sieve; to a half pint 
add two tablespoons of melted butter, quarter of a cup of milk, seasoning 
of salt and pepper, and two beaten egg yolks. . Mix thoroughly, fold in 
two beaten egg whites, and turn into a buttered mold, set in a pan of 
hot water and bake in the oven until the center is firm. Serve turned 
from (he mold and accompanied by a rich cream sauce made from one 
tablespoon each of flour and butter with a cup of scalded cream or rich 
milk and seasoning of salt, pepper, celery salt and mace. This can be 
baked in individual molds if desired. 

Scalloped Squash. — Two cup fuls of boiled squash run through a 
colander, and then let cool; two eggs, a tablespoonful of melted butter, 
half a cup of milk; pepper and salt; half a cupful of bread crumbs- Beat 
^gs, butter and milk and squash light; season; pour into a buttered bake 
dish, sift crumbs over it and bake, covered, half an hour ; then brown 
lightly. 

Slewed Summer Squash. — Wash, pare, cut into pieces after removing 
the seeds, cook :n a small quantity of water until tender ; drain and press 
dry, salt slightly and serve on golden -browned toast with a cream dress- 
ing made as follows : Into half a pint of rich milk stir one teaspoonful 
of cornstarch, let boil until slightly thickened, then pour it over the toast 
and squash. 

Sweet Potato, Southern Style. — Peel and boil until they are thoroughly 
but not too well cooked. Then they should be cut into four pieces length- 
wise and placed in a tin baking pan. Butter and sugar should be placed 
over the potatoes abundantly before they are put in the oven to bake 
slowly. After a while, the butter and sugar mingling with the juice of 
the potatoes, forms a delicate crust that should be cooked until it has 



123 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

almost reached Ihe point at which it is candy. Under this crust is a 
thick, rich syrup of the sap of the potatoes, sugar and butter. 

Stuffed Sweet Potatoes,— Select large, fine potatoes of uniform size. 
Bake them soft, taking care that they do not bum. With a sharp knife 
fut a slit lengthwise in each and scrape out the inside, breaking the skm 
as little as possible. Put the pulp into a bowl ; work into it a tablespoon- 
ful of butter, enough hot milk to make a soft paste ; salt and pepper to 
taste, and a teaspoonful of lemon juice. Beat light, and fill the emptied 
skins with the mixture. Bring the cut edges neatly together, and set the 
potatoes back in the oven to reheat. Serve in a deep dish lined with a 
heated napkin. 

Baked Tomatoes, Italian Style. — Pour two tablespoonfuls of olive oil 
into a baking dish. Add four tablespoonfuls of grated bread crumbs 
that have already been mixed with parsley and other herbs, all of which 
must have been chopped very fine. Season with pepper and salt. Upon 
this bed of oil and crumbs lay a dozen tomatoes that have been cut in 
halves. Cover them with four more tablespoonfuls of bread crumbs that 
have previously been seasoned in the same way. Pour over all two more 
tablespoonfuls of oil and send the dish to a hot oven, where the tomatoes 
must bake for about one hour. 

Panned Tomatoes. — These are excellent served with roast meats. Put 
in a pan with two ounces of butter six firm tomatoes that have been cut 
in halves. Cook slowly on the top of the range for 10 minutes, then 
brown quickly in the oven. Remove the tomatoes to a hot platter, and 
make a sauce by adding to the browned butter two tablespoonfuls of 
flour, and after it is rubbed smooth one pint of milk. Stir until boiling. 
Season well with salt and pepper and pour over the tomatoes. Garnish 
with parsley and points of toast 

Scallop of Tomatoes and Potatoes. — Season a pint of peeled and 
chopped tomatoes with salt, pepper and onion juice to suit the taste, and 
add enough potatoes to make a cupful when chopped fine. Butter a baking 
dish and sprinkle with bread crumbs and put in half of the tomatoes; 
then a layer of soft crackers, buttered and broken in coarse bits. Cover 
the crackers with two heaping tablespoonfuls of grated American cheese. 
Then add the remainder of the tomatoes, more cracker crumbs and bits 
of butter and place in a hot oven. Bake SO minutes. Serve at once.

CANNING AND PnKSBRVIKG, 

This chnpter does not aim to cover the entire ground, but to give 
briefly the cKperiencc of other housewives, which may include some in- 
formation not generally found in print. There are still many housewives 
who laboriously can fruit by cooking it in a kettle, and then lifting it 
into the jars; we make preserves in that way, but our canned fruit 
is packed into jars, covered with hot syrup, and then cooked by standing 
the jars in water in a wash boiler. Instead of putting odd pieces of board 
in the bottom of the boiler to rest the jars on, have a board made to fit, 
with three cleats across it underneath and a number of auger holes bored 
in it so that the water passes through. We usually put enough water to 
come half way up the jars, but some housekeepers elevate the jars above 
the water and cover the boiler closely, thus cooking the fruit in the steam. 
Of course there are cooking kettles made for this purpose which are 
more convenient than a wash boiler. 

Fruit is canned without sugar after the following method: Fill the 
jars with fruit; then pour in as much water as they will hold; adjust the 
rubbers; lay the lids carefully on top without fastening them down; stand 
the jars in a wash boiler, the bottom of which has been protected with a 
rack; surround them with cold water; put the lid on the boiler; bring to 
boiling point and boil strawberries, blackberries, raspberries and currants 
for twenty minutes; cherries, for three-quarters of an hour; pineapples, 
for half an hour ; peaches and pears, for half an hour. Strawberries and 
raspberries are better without water. Fill the jars with fruit, bring them 
to boiling point, and when the fruit shrinks or settles you may fill two 
jars from a third; put them back in the boiler; cook for five or 10 
minutes longer and then fasten on the lids. Seat the jars. Lift the jars 
one at a time and screw on the lids without lifting them. Wipe the jars, 
put them into a cool place out of the draught. Next morning give each 
lid a turn and store in a cool dark place. 

Canned fruit may also be cooked in the oven. Pack the prepared 
fruit in the jars, fill up with hot syrup, and lay the cover on top of the 
jar without fastening. Place in the oven, setting in a dripping-pan holding 
about two inches of water, or on a strip of asbestos. The oven should be 
moderately hot. Cook the fruit 10 or 15 minutes, dependent again upon 
the fruit, then lift from the oven, one can at a time, fill to overflowing 
with the scalding syrup, running the blade of a silver knife around the 
edge of the can to allow for the escape of all air-bubbles, then wipe and 



124 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

screw as tightly as possible. Set the jars on a thickly folded newspaper, 
out of a draft, until the fruit has cooled, then tighten again. 

The following method is highly recommended for small fruits : Look 
over the fruit carefully, using only that which is perfect. Place in glass 
jars, that are also perfect. Shake down the fruit, but do not press down. 
Have ready enough hot syrup to cover the fruit. FHI the can full of the 
syrup, including the fruit already in. Screw on the cover tightly, and 
drop into a pail of boiling water. Be sure that the water is bciltng, and 
that it covers the can well. Remove the pail to the table or some other 
convenient place; when the water is cool, take out the can, screw down 
the cover, if it is not tight, label, wrap in brown paper, and put away in 
the fruit cupboard. 

Some firm fruits, and also rhubarb, may be canned without cooking, 
being packed into the bottle, which is then .filled with cold water. The 
jar is filled to overflowing, and any air bubbles removed by running the 
blade of a silver knife down the side ; it is then sealed lightly and stored 
in a coo! dark place. 

Try to avoid beet sugar when making jelly. We have never succeeded 
in hardening a fruit jefly made with beet sugar, and many exasperating 
cases of jelly that won't "jell" are due to this cause. Marian Harland 
says that many years ago she was advised to use one-fifth more beet sugar 
than a recipe called for when cane sugar was used. 

Almack's Preserves. — This is a foreign recipe. Peel and stone one 
quart of large ripe plums ; peel and slice one dozen apples and one dozen 
pears. Arrange in an earthen jar in alternate layers, adding one pound 
of sugar to each pound of fruit. Set on back of range on an asbestos 
mat and simmer slowly until a little when cooled on ice shows it to be 
of such a firm consistency that it can be cut with a knife, for it is to be 
served cut in slices. When sufficiently cooked put away in a shallow jar 
from which it will be easy to cut it out. Seal like jellj, with paraffin 
before covering. 

Preserved Ginger. — Clean and wash some fine green ginger roots, let 
them lie several hours in cold water, drain and place the roots in ^ 
kettle of boiling water, cook 30 minutes; drain and rinse off with cold 
water; return the ginger to the kettle, cover with fresh boiling water and 
cook until the ginger is soft; drain and put in cold water. Next day 
drain the roots in a sieve and weigh them ; allow for each pound one 
pound of sugar and one-half pint of water ; boil sugar and water five 
minutes, add the ginger, boil a few minutes, remove and poor the ginger 
in a bowl. Twelve hours later drain off the syrup, boil it three r 
and pour it over the ginger ; repeat this twice more. Then drain off 
the syrup, place over the fire, boil to a soft ball, add the ginger, cook t 
minutes and fill into jars.

Canned Baked Apples. — Select good tart cooking apples; wash, remove 
the blossom end, but do not peel. Arrange in a baking pan with hot 
water to half fill the pan. Sprinkle with sugar, bits of sweet butter, and 
a dash of any spice if desired, and bake until tender. Can while hot, using 
the juice ii) which they were baked. Stand the jar in hot water 30 
minutes before wanted for use, and you will have perfect baked apples 
for breakfast. Fears canned the same way are fine, or pears with thinly 
. sliced quince scattered among them. 

Canned Porter Apples. — Wipe, quarter, core and peel the apples, then 
weigh them. Make a syrup by boiling for 10 minutes one-third the weight 
of the apples in granulated sugar with water, the proportion being 254 
cupfuls of water to one pound of sugar. Cook the apples slowly in the 
syrup until soft; do not crowd them. Skim out the apples carefully into 
jars, cover with the boiling syrup, and seal. 

Apple Ginger.— Tie a little ginger root in a bag. A quarter of a pound 
will do for eight pounds of apples. Fut the bag of ginger into three 
pints of cold, dear water. When the water is highly flavored add about 
three-quarters of a pound of sugar to every pound of apples. The three 
pints of water will be sufEcient for six pounds of sugar. Add the juice 
of two lemons, laying aside the yellow peel cut in shreds. Clarify the 
syrup by allowing it to cool after it has cooked five minutes and mixing 
the white of two eggs and the shells in the cooled syrup. Return the 
syrup to the fire, let it boil up once, and then draw to the back of the 
stove. A scura will cover it. Strain into a clean saucepan, add the 
yellow peel of the lemons and put in quarters of apples. As soon as 
cooked, lift them out and put in more. Place the apples into jars and 
pour the syrup over them, 

Apple Orange Marmalade.— Core and slice 20 large tart apples. Allow 
for every quart one pint of water. Add the thin peel of one orange, cover 
and boil until tender. Place a sieve over a bowl, pour in the apples and 
let drain without disturbing. Allovf for each pint one pound of sugar. 
Peel four large oranges, remove white part and seeds and set aside. Boil 
apple juice till very thick, add orange cut into small pieces and cook until 
a drop retains its shape on a plate. Put in glass jars and cover like 
jelly. The apple pulp may be used in pies. 

Preserved Apples. — Pare and core fine, ripe pippins, and cut them into 
quarters. Weight and to each pound allow one pound of granulated sugar 
and a half pint of boiling water, the grated rind of one and the juice of 
two lemons. Boil the sugar and water until clear (about three minutes), 
skimming the scum from the .surface, add the juice and rind of the lemons, 
then the apples, and simmer gently until they are clear and {ender, but 
not broken, then stand aside to cool. When cold, put them into jars, cover 



isa THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

closely and stand in a cool, dark place for one week. At the end of that 
time turn them carefully into the kettle, bring them to boiling point, and 
simmer for five minutes, then return them to the jars, cover closely with 
tissue paper brushed over with the white of an egg, and put in a dark, 
cool place to keep. Apples are more difficult to keep than any other fruit 

Blackberry cheese is an old-fashioned but excellent recipe. Three pounds 
apples, peeled and cored; three pounds blackberries. To each pound pulp 
allow three-quarters pound sugar. Peel, core and slice the apples, put 
them in a jar with the blackberries, which must be picked over, and let 
them remain in the oven for three-quarters of an hour, or till the fruit 
is quite soft; pulp through a sieve, and to every pound of pulp allow 
three-quarters of a pound of sugar; boil the pulp for another hour; put 
into jars very hot, and when cold cover in the usual way. It should be 
firm enough to slice when turned out. 

Barberry Jam. — Pick three pounds of barberries from the stalk, put 
them in a jar or farina boiler, with three pounds of sugar. Stand the jar 
in a saucepan of boiling water, and simmer gently until the sugar ts 
dissolved and berries soft, then stand aside all night. In the morning 
put them in a porcelain-lined kettle, and simmer slowly for 35 minutes, 
stirring continually. Turn into glasses and seal when cool, like jelly. 

Barberry Preserves. — This is a very old-fashioned recipe. Four quarts 
of barberries picked from the stems, washed and drained. Heat one large 
quart of molasses and one quart of white sugar together until the sugar 
is dissolved. Skim, and (hen add the barberries. Cook until they begin 
to pop and shrivel, which will be in about 10 minutes. Skim them into a 
stone jar, then boil the syrup slowly until it will cover the berries. 

Bar le Due Preserves.— Take selected red (or white) currants of large 
size, one by one, carefully make an incision in the skin, one-fourth an 
inch in size, with tiny embroidery scissors. Through this slit, with a 
sharp needle, remove the seeds, separately, preserving the shape of the 
fruit. Take the weight of the currants in strained honey and, when hot, 
add the currants. Ij;t simmer 'a minute or two, then seal as jelly. The 
currants retain their shape, are of a beautiful color and melt in the 
mouth. Should the currants liquefy the honey too. much, carefully skim 
them out, reduce the syrup at a gentle simmer to desired consistency and 
store as before aftei' adding the fruit. 

Black Currants.— Gather the currants on a dry day; to every pound 
allow half a pint red currant juice and a pound and a half of finely 
pounded loaf sugar. Clip off the heads and stalks ; put the juice, currant) 
and sugar in a preserving pan; shake it frequently till it boils; carefully 
remove the fruit from the sides of the pan, and take off the scum as it 
rises; let it boil for 10 or is minutes. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 127 

Blueberry Mixtures.— A combination of blueberriea and gooseberries, 
one portion of gooseberries to three of the blueberries, canned in the 
ordinary fashion, makes an excellent Winter sauce or filling for piei. So 
does a combination of blueberries and rhubarb, one cupful of rhubarb 
and one cupful of sugar to a quart of blueberries. 

Cherry Conserve. — Five quarts cherries (sour), one pound raisins 
(seeded and cut) ; two oranges (pulp cut in pieces, also yellow of skin) ; 
one pound English walnuts (chopped) ; 2'/i pounds sugar. Cook until 
thick and put in jelly tumblers. Cherries must be boiled about SO minutes 
before putting in sugar, etc. 

Cherry Conserve No. Z. — Three pounds sour cherries; two pounds 
raisins; four pounds granulated sugar; four large oranges. Seed and 
steam the raisins for half an hour. Grate some of the orange peel in the 
cherries. Do not use the orange skin. Cut the pulp into small pieces. 
Mix all the ingredients together, boil for 20 minutes, put in glasses. 

Cherry Preserve, Sun-cooked. — Pit the cherries, which must be perfect 
ripe fruit, weigh, and put in a preserving kettle, allowing three-quarters of 
a pound of sugar to each pound of fruit Do not add any water; the 
juice and sugar make the syrup. Ering to a boil, and boil for SO minutes, 
stirring to avoid .burning and skimming to keep clear. Skim out the 
fruit, putting on shallow platters, pour the syrup over, and cover with 
clean panes of g!ass. Put the platters out'in the sun, and keep outdoor* 
three days, bringing in at night. Then put in jars, like any other pre- 
serve. The sun cooks the syrup to a honey-like consistence, and the flavor 
is delicious. Strawberries .cooked the same way have all the rich frag- 
rance of the fresh fruit. 

Citron Preserves. — Pare and core the citron, cut into strips and notch 
the edges, or cut into fancy shapes. Allow a pound of sugar to a pound 
of fruit, and to six pounds of the fruit allow four lemons and a quarter 
of a pound of ginger root. Tie the ginger root in a cloth and boil it in a 
quart and a half of water until the flavor is extracted ; then remove it and 
add to the water the sugar and the juice of the lemons. Stir until the 
sugar is dissolved and the syrup is clear, remove any scum that may form, 
then add the citron and cook until it is clear, but not soft enough to fall 
apart; can and seal while hot. 

Citron Preserves No. 3. — Cut the citron in strips half an inch wide, 
pare off the rind as thin as possible and cut up the fruit in small squares. 
Put in a vessel and cover the fruit with water in which has been dis- 
solved an ounce of alum to the gallon of water. Soak 24 hours, or until 
the citron is clarified. Take out of alum water and soak in clear water 
until the alum is all out, which will probably bfe in 13 hours. Weigh and 
allow to each pound of fruit a pound of sugar. Put the fruit in a pre- 
serving kettle with only a little sugar, adding s4|h» several times until 



128 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

the weighed amount has been used. Season with any flavoring preferred. 
Cook rapidly until done, put in glass can; and seal. 

Citron Preserves No. 3. — Pare a large citron, cut into thin slices, and 
then into strips or squares, removing all seeds. Weigh equal quantities of 
fruit and sugar, mijc together, and stand over night in a large bowl; the 
sugar draws out juice, forming a syrup. In the morning put in a pre- 
serving kettle, and boil slowly for two to three hours, skimming carefully, 
until the syrup is like honey. About IS minutes before taking from the 
stove add, for each quart of preserves, one lemon cut in very thin slices, 
and one small piece of green ginger root. Some housekeepers add a few 
whole cloves, but we do not care for this. Another method puts the 
sliced fruit to soak in brine for a few hours, then in clear water to freshen 
it, this process hardening the fruit, but we have never used this process, 
and are quite satisfied with tht first recipe given. 

Dried Citron. — To prepare citron for cakes and pies cut the fruit in 
four parts, pare and remove the seeds ; then take a couple of quarts of 
clear water, dissolve a piece of alum the size of a hickorynut in the 
water, put in the preserving kettle as much citron as the water will cover 
and boil until tender enough to pierce with a Straw; then boil in sugar; 
a pint bowl of sugar to the same measure of fruit. B<m1 one-half hour. 
Spread it on pie plates and set it in a cool oven or heater and let it dry 
perfectly. 

Preserved Crab Apples. — The apples should be very ripe. Wash them 
well in cold water; put them into a porcelain-lined kettle and just cover 
with boiling water. Let them cook very gently until you can remove the 
skins easily. Drain them, peel and carefully remove the cores, but do not 
break the apples or remove the stems. Weigh them, allowing one and 
one-quarter pound of sugar to a pound of fruit ; allow a cupful of water 
to this quantity of sugar. Put water and sugar over the fire and bring to 
boiling point. Skim until clear, then put in the apples and cook very 
gently until they are tender and transparent Skim while cooking. When 
they are done put them into small, large-mouthed jars, and when cool 
seal same as jelly. 

Currants, Canning. — Wash the currants, being careful not to break 
them; remove stems, and pack currants into quart cans, shaking them 
down well. To each can add one cup hot sugar, place the jars on a 
wooden frame in the boiler, place the covers loosely on the cans, and put 
enough of cold water in the boiler, so when it begins to boil it will not 
boil into the cans. After the water has boiled for half an hour, the cans 
should be lifted out, the covers screwed on tight and put in a cool, dark 
place until wanted for the table. For those that like mixed fruits, a layer 
of strawberries or raspberries and then a layer of currants may be packed 
in the cans. ^^ 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. ISB 

Currant Conserve. — Five pounds currants; four pounds sugar; one 
pound seeded raisins; four oranges. Grate rind and squeeze out juice of 
oranges. Boil all together half hour. Put in jelly glasses. 

Currant Sauce —Five pounds of currants, heat in preserving kettle, put 
in a muslin bag and squeeze out all juice. Add five pounds granulated 
sugar, one pound raisins, seeded and chopped fine, two oranges, chopped 
Sue. Boil till like jelly. The sender of this recipe does up currants with- 
out cooking. Occasionally she says a can spoils, but on the whole she has 
good luck, every can keeping perfectly some years. The currants are 
looked over carefully, washed and then mashed thorottghly, a glass bottle 
being good for (his purpose. She then adds sugar, pound for pound. The 
fruit is sealed in cans, using new rubbers each time. Pineapples are also 
put up in somewhat the same way. Mrs. C.'s way is to chop the fruit 
fine, add sugar pound for pound. The fruit thus prepared is left in a 
gallon crock for two days, its contents being stirred frequently with a 
silver spoon. At the end 'of the second day the fruit is put in air- 
tight cans. 

Cranberry aiid Apple Jam. — Take two pounds of cranberries and two 
pounds of apples after they are peeled, cored and chopped. ?ut them in 
a preserving pan- with Sii pounds of sugar. When it comes-to the boil 
keep the preserve boiling for half an hour, then try a tittle on a cold 
saucer, and if on cooling it sets well it will be sufficiently done. Tie dowp 
in small jars. This makes a delicious preserve, the cranberries imparting 
a fine flavor and giving in addition a brilliant color. 

Damson CheeSe. — Boil the fruit, with only enough water to prevent 
burning, umil tender; rub through a hair sieve until like a paste, add six 
ounces of sugar to each pound of fruit, stir off the fire until the sugar is 
dissolved, then add four chopped kernels from the fruit to each quart, and 
put back to boil. It is wise to put an asbestos mat under the preserving 
kettle, as the fruit will catch and burn very easily. Boil, stirring con- 
tinually, until the preserve will leave the pan quite dry and adhere in a 
mass to the spoon. Press into jelly glasses, and when cold co»er with 
paraffin before sealing. When served, the damson cheese is turned out 
of the glass, and cut in thin slices. 

Elderberries. — These may be combined with gooseberries, crab apples 
and green grapes, equal parts of either, making a piquant table sauce, 
while pies made from them might please the individual who does not 
care for the flavor of the single fruit. For Winter use elderberries may 
be preserved in cither of the "above combinations and treated as other fruit, 
or canned plain without sugar for use in pies only. When making pies 
from the plain canned fruit it is wise to cook the berries with the same 
proportion of sugar, flour, etc., as given for fresh berries, filling the pie 
paste when cold. This insures a jelly-like consistency of the finished 



180 THE RURAL COOK BOOK, 

product without those unpalatable doughy lumps too often seen. A^^ 
they may be spiced and used as a table sauce or in pies, using the same 
proportion. 

Pickled Elderberries for Pies.— Seven pounds elderberries, stemmed, 
four pounds sugar, one pint vinegar, two tablespoonfuls cinnamon, one 
tablespoon cloves. Boil until the juice is rather thick. They will keep 
in an o^a Jar. 

Preserved Elderberries. — Seven pounds of elderberries, three pounds of 
granulated sugar, three lemons sliced thin; put the elderberries alone in a 
stone jar in warm salt and. water over night Next morning drain them 
In a colander, make syrup of the sugar and lemons and one pint of water, 
then put elderberries in the syrup and cook. When they begin to boil 
hard time them 20 minutes, then pour in a jar or can ready for use. 

Preserved Elderberries No. 2.— Shell berries. To an eight-quart panful 
use a heaping tablespoon of salt, pour on hot water and let stand half 
an hour; drain well. To seven pounds of berries thus prepared, use three 
pounds of sugar and one pint of vinegar; boil well. If one wish to keep 
in jars without sealing they should be boiled down thoroughly. For pies 
add a little sugar and flour enough slightly to thicken the juice. 

Spiced Elderberries. — Nine pounds cleaned elderberries, three pounds 
brown sugar, one pint vinegar and one ounce each of cloves, cinnamon 
and allspice. Put sugar and vinegar in a two-gallon granite kettle over 
a slow fire and let come to a boil. Add berries and let simmer two and a 
half hours. Tie spices in little muslin bags and add when nearly done. 
Seal in air-tight cans. 

Preserved Figs. — Take fresh, ripe fes, cut off half the stem of each 
and let soak all night in very weak brine, using two tablespoonfuls of 
salt to each quart of water. In the morning drain and cover with fresh 
water. Make a thick syrup, allowing three-quarters of a pound of sugar 
to each pound of fruit, and one-half cupful of water to each pound of 
sugar. Simmer for a few minutes until th'e syrup is dear, then drain 
and lay in it the freshened figs and simmer slowly until they look clear. 
Into each jar drop a half-inch piece of green ginger and the kernels of 
lialf a dozen peach stones, fill with fruit and syrup and seal. They should 
not be used for at. least three months. 

Garfield Butter. — Use two-thirds plums and one-third peaches. Stone 
the plums and pare and stone the peaches. Mash and heat slowly to boil- 
ing, boil until soft, then rub through a sieve. Measure the pulp thus 
obtained and to one measure of fruit add three-quarters of a measure 
of sugar. Boil until thick, stirring continually, then put into jars and seal. 

Canned Grapes. — After picking ripe grapes from the stem, wash them. 
Remove the skins, keeping them and the pulps separate. Cook the pulps 
until the seeds begin to separate. Run through a colander or coarse sieve 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 131 

to remove the seeds. Add the skins to the pulp, cooking till tender. Allow 
one-half pound of sugar to each pound of fruit. 

Gooseberries with Currant Juice. — The tops and tails being removed 
from the gooseberries, allow an equal quantity of finely-pounded loaf sugar 
and put a layer of each alternately into a large, deep jar; poUr into it as 
much dripped red currant juice as will dissolve the su^r, adding its 
weight in sugar. The next day put all in a. preserving pan, boil it, and 
put up as other jams. 

Grape Marmalade. — Choose ripe grapes of any familiar kind, and place 
them in the preserving kettle with just enough water to prevent their 
burning. Cook slowly at the side of the stove until they are well broken 
and mashed. Then press through a sieve and measure the pulp. For 
each pint allow half a pound of sugar. Place the grape pulp over the 
fire, boil for 20 minutes, add the sugar and boil from 10 to SO minutes 
longer, or until a drop of the mixture when put on a plate will retain its 
shape without spreading. Stir constar^tly while cooking. Skim carefully 
from time to time and when done pack in small jars. 

Grape and Apple Marmalade.— Many people do not care for the flavor 
of the Clinton grape, but it is excellent to use with sweet apples in mar- 
malade, following a New England recipe, in which the wild frost grape is 
ordinarily used. Heat four pounds of stemmed and pulped grapes until 
the seeds are free of pulp. Have four pounds of sweet apples pared, cored, 
sliced and steamed until tender. Sift the grape pulp, add the apples,. turn 
into a kettle set on asbestos mat or back of range and simmer slowly for 
two hours; measure, add sugar in the proportion of three-quarters of a 
pound to 3 pint of pulp, and cook until a little, chilled on ice, shows that 
it is Stiff enough to retain its shape. Turn into jelly glasses and seal. 

Grape Preserves. — Press the pulp out of each grape; boil the pulps 
until tender, then press through colander to remove the seeds; mix the 
skins with the pulp and juice; add as many cupfuls of sugar as there are 
of grapes and boil together until thickened. Green grapes are preserved 
by cutting each grape in halves, taking out the seeds, then adding an equal 
quantity of sugar and boiling all together until the right consistency; seal 
while hot. 

Spiced Grapes. — Press the skins from the grapes and put the pulp 
through the colander; add the skins and weigh. To every pound of 
grapes add one cupful of vinegar, two ounces of powdered cinnamon, one 
ounce of powdered cloves and three and a half pounds of sugar; boil an 
hour and a half until thick, then bottle. Small Damson plums are very 
nice prepared in the same way. 

Marmalades. — One simple process will serve for all kinds of marma- 
lade, and that is to cook the fruit in its own juice to a state of collapse. 
Then press through a colander, measure, bring to a boil, and skim, before

additiB: the sugar— meature for measure. Cook with care after the sugar 
scum begins to thicken. When the juice rolls up a jelly on a cold silver 
spoon, the marmalade is ready for pint can, or for glasses, covered when 
cold with one-fourth inch, at llie least, of hot paraffin. All the small fruits 
make delicious marmalades when pressed through a fine colander or sieve 
to remove the seeds. Grapes and blackberries do not require full measure 
for measure of sugar. Plums are easily converted into a palatable mar- 
' malade after removing the pits, but they are more easily made into pre- 
serves, the same as peaches, and quinces; both are too good for marma- 
lades. By the following method clingstone peaches can be utilized, also 
imperfect pears and quinces. Pare the peaches and cut into pieces as 
small as a cherry, pack into a measuring dish and note the amount. Add 
water to prevent burning and cook thoroughly before adding the sugar — 
measure for measure. Boil with care the same as for marmalade, and 
place in airtight cans. 

Pineapple Marmalade. — Use thoroughly ripe pineapples, peel them, and 
after removing the hard core, chop them. To each pound of fruit and 
juice, add a pound of sugar, and simmer one hour. Frequent skimming 
and stirring will be necessary. Cool some of it, and if not thick enough. 
continue the boiling half an hour longer. An asbestos cover slipped under 
the keltic is a safeguard against scorching. Crab-apple and plum marma- 
lade is excellent. Use the Siberian crab-apples and Bradshaw or other 
violet red plums. Allow two parts apples to one part plums. Wash the 
fruit and cut out the imperfections. Simmer both kinds until soft, then 
rub through a sieve. Allow a pound of su^'ar to each pint of fruit pulp. 
Put the sugar in the oven to heat, and cook the fruit 20 minutes in a 
porcelain -lined or agate kettle. Add the hot sugar, skim, and cook 30 
minutes longer. Stir very often. ■ 

Peach Marmalade. — Use finr: late peaches. Peel the peaches and cut 
them in halves. Crack two-thirds of the kernels, blanch theiii,_and cut 
into lengthwise strips. Put the peaches over the fire with three-fourths 
of a pound of sugar to each pound of fruit. Stir frequently and cook 
from 30 minutes to half an hour. Five minutes before removing from 
the lire add the blanched kernels. 

Quince Marmalade. — Rub the fruit with a cloth, cut out the flower end, 
and chop without removing the skins and cores. Cook until soft enough 
to rub through a sieve. Strain the fruit and add three-quarters pound of 
sugar to a pound of fruit. Cook slowly until done, which should be in 
15 or 20 minutes, Apple marmalade affords a change from cider apple 
sauce and stewed apples. Take seven pounds of apples (Fall Pippins are 
nice) and stew them wilh a pint of water. Put them through a sieve, 
add three-quarters pound of sugar to a pound of pulp, also the juice 
and grated yellow rind of three lemons. Boil half hour, then add a little 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 133 

ginger root. This may be made of one-lhird quince and two-thirds applet, 
leaving out the ginger and lemons. 

Mixed Marmalade. — Take equal quantities of peaches, apples, pears 
and quinces that have been pared, cored and cut in eighths. Cook quinces 
in water to coyer until almost tender. Drain and measure the water. 
For six pounds of mixed fruit there should be one pint of water. Add 
quinces to the other fruit, place in preserve kettle with water, and let 
them cook thoroughly, but not burn. Take out and mash well together. 
Measure. Clean the kettle and put ihem hack with half their weight in 
granulated sugar. Let Ihem cook very slowly two hours. Keep them 
stirred well from the bottom and protect with an asbestos mat or set the 
kettle in another containing boiling water, as on no account must the jam 
burn. Seal in small jars. 

Orange and Apple Marmalade. — Cut the apples in small pienes with- 
out peeling them and add a pint of water for every quart of appks. Boil 
them down for half an hour and strain through a sieve. Add the juice 
and pulp of three oranges and a little of the yellow peel cut fine to every 
pnit of apple pulp. To each pint of the mixture, add three-fourths of a 
pound of sugar. Bcil tlie marmalade until it curls before the finger when 
ii is cooled for trial. 

Preserved Melon Rind. — Pare the melon very thin; do not pare away 
all the ripened melon. Leave about one-quarter inch attached to the rind. 
Cut in pieces and place in a crock over night with salt sprinkled between 
the layers. In the morning drain, pour boiling water over, leave for 
one-half hour, drain again. New weigh the fruit — to 10 pounds fruit add 
five pounds granulated sugar, one-half gallon white vinegar, one ounce 
stick ciimamon, one ounce white ginger root, and one-half ounce whole 
cloves. Tie the spice in small muslin bags, place all in a large pan and 
boil slowly. The longer it boils the nicer will it be. 

Milk, Canning. — A correspondent tells us she has canned milk in this 
way and kept it a year : Allow the milk to become perfectly cold, then 
fill sterilized fruit jars to wiihin a half inch of the top; put on the 
covers loosely and set into a clean boiler on a board with holes through ; ' 
fill boiler with cold water to wiihin an inch of the tops of the jars; bring 
the water to tile boiling point and allow it to boil 20 minutes after ebulli- 
tion begins, then remove the cans one by one, put on new rubbers, fill 
with boiling milk, screw the covers on and invert the cans till cold. Pi:t 
away in a cool, dark place and use when the cows have dried up. Of 
course this will taste like scalded milk, but for all purposes except drink- 
ing it is all right. As the cream does not dry, it can readily be mixed 
with the milk if desired. If directions are followed carefully and every- 
thing used made perfectly clean little or none will spoil. It is quite 



134 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

essential to use new rubber rings, as old ones become hard and will not 
make the jars tight. 

Or-ra-cur. — Five pounds of currants, five pounds of sugar, juice and 
grated rinds of three oranges, one pound of raisins, chopped and stoned ; 
boil all together for 20 minutes, and put away in jelly glasses. 

Peach Butter. — This is a nice way to use up peaches that are too ripe 
for canning or pickling. Pare ripe peaches, put in a kettle with sufficient 
water to cover peaches ; when soft run through a colander, the stone* 
being thus easily removed To each quart' of peaches thus prepared add 
V/i pound of granulated sugar. Boil slowly till thick; add ground cinna- 
mon to taste. This, like all butters and marmalades, requires constant 
watching to keep the fruit from burning. 

Spiced Peaches. — Weigh eight pounds of freestone peaches after they 
have been peeled, halved and the stones taken out. Put peaches in a por- 
celain lined kettle with one pint of vinegar and five pounds of sugar 
(granulated). Mix one ounce each of cinnamon sticks, whole mace 
and green ginger and one-half ounce of whole cloves. Divide into eight 
parts, tie each in a piece of cheesecloth and drop in the kettle with the 
peaches. Simmer until the fruit is tender, then lift it with a skimmer 
and put it in sterilized jars. Boil the syrup a minute, skim, lift out the 
Bags, then pcur over the fruit in the jars. It is an improvement to break 
IS peach stones, blanch the kernels in boiling water and add them to 
ti:c syrup just before pouring it into the jars. 

Peach Jam.— Pare, stone and cut into thin slices half a peck of free- 
stone peaches. Weigh. To each pound of fruit add three-quarters of a 
pound of granulated sugar. Put in layers in a preserve kettle and let 
them cook gently until clear, which will probably take an hour. Have 
ready cracked one-third the peach stones, remove and blanch the kernels, 
then slice them thin and sprinkle them among the layers of peaches so all 
can cook together. Put into small glass jars or tumblers when cold 
Shut up air-tight. 

Peach Leather.— Pare fully ripe peaches (yellow ones preferred) ; 
remove the pits and weigh. To each pound of fruit add one-fourth pound 
of granulated sugar. Put in stew kettle and cook slowly, mashing the 
fruit as it boils. When cooked to a thick paste spread on a buttered 
board and put in the sun to dry. Put out the second day and when dry 
enough that it will not slick, loll up like a roll of leather and keep in a 
cool, dry place. Slice from the end of the roll. 

. Pears in Cider.— One of our friends reports that KJeffer pears are 
delicious canned in sweet cider. The customary syrup is made bj naelt 
tng sugar in the cider, and the pears are cooked in this (not over-cooked) 
either in the jars or in a kettle. The cider is said to give much richness 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 139 

of flavor. Pears were also canned in perry (pear cider), but the res«ll 
was Dot considered so desirable as where the apple juice was used. ' ; 

Pear Chips. — Four pounds of Duchess or other hard pears sliced thin, 
four pounds of sugar, the juice of three lemons and grated rind of one, 
one ounce of dry or g^een ginger root chopped fine and one-half ttiiid>ler 
of water. Cook until clear, then seal in jelly glasses. 

Pear Syrup. — Very nice syrup may be made from pears, core and 
pare them; cover with cold water and set on back of stove, let simmer 
until soft, then dip oS juice carefully or strain through a colander. If 
the juice is not clear strain through a £ne strainer. Return to the (ire 
and boil down rapidly to about one-quarter, then add sugar, about as for 
jelly, a cupful of sugar to a cupful of juice. Boil until the syrup is thick 
as you wish and put in glass jars. This, when properly made, is thought 
to be as nice as maple syrup. The flavor may be varied a little by usit^ 
a very little lemon juice or green ginger. If desirable, the cooked pears 
may be used by boiling them a short time with a little sugar, or with 
sugar and vinegar. 

Persimmon Figs.— Gather them, and press each fruit between thumb 
and finger, and put in layers tn an open-mouthed jar with a thin layer of 
sugar between the layers of fruit and sugar on the top. After a few 
weeks, say three or four, lay on a platter or plate in single layers and 
dry in a very cool oven or in the sun. 

Canned Plums Without Cooking.— This recipe comes from the plum 
belt of central New York, and will be found very satisfactory: Take 
enough large yellow egg plums to fill a quart can. Put them into a 
granite or earthen pan and pour boiling water over them, let stand three 
minutes, then drain. Pour over more boiling water, which will crack 
the skins. Remove the skins, and place the plums carefully in a hot 
sterilized glass jar. Have ready a thick syrup made by boiling two 
cupfuls of granulated sugar that has been moistened with water, and 
cooked to the "brittle stage." Pour the boiling syrup over the plums and 
seal. The syrup will form like "icicles," but after a day or two will 
dissolve. Make enough syrup for two or three cans at once, as it is 
hard to tell just how much it will take to fill a can. They always keep 
perfectly, and retain their flavor much better than when cooked, but the 
secret is in having everything boiling hot. 

Plum Cheese. — For economy make this on the same day you make 
plum jelly. After extracting the jelly juice pass the remaining pulp 
tlirough a colander to remove skins and pits, then weigh. Add a pound 
of sugar to every two pounds of plums and boil one-half an hour; seal up. 

Plums in Cold Water.— A housekeeper who has had experience with 
the cold-water process of keeping fruit says she has kept wild plums 
all Winter in this way, putting them in a lai^ stone jar and covering 



IH THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

them with enough cold water to leave about four inches over them. A 
saucer or plate with a weight on it must be placed on top of the fruit 
"to keep the top layers deep enough under the water. To make sauce 
Ircm wild plums kept in this way, take out as many of the fruit as are 
required, and parhoil until the skins crack in water containing a pinch 
of baking soda. Then rinse well in clear cold water, drop into boiling 
syrup, and cook until done. This makes a delicious sauce; the parboiling 
with the soda takes the "pucker" out of the fruit. Cranberries will keep 
for months if covered with cold water as described, and many house- 
keepers put up green currants and gooseberries, also rhubarb, in the same 

Plum Conserve. — Five pounds plums, peeTed and pitted; five pounds 
sugar ; cook plums 20 minutes before adding sugar. Put in sugar and 
boil a little, then add two pounds setded raisins (cut into small pieces), 
grated rind of four oranges and the pulp chipped (easier to cut with 
scissors). Cook to a thick conserve (15 to 20 minutes), and put in jelly 
glasses. Cherries (sour) are good used instead of ptums; pit them. 
Currants may also be used instead of plums. 

Pineapple and Flum Jam. — Twelve pounds of large plums, five Urge 
pineapples, one quart of water and sugar in the proportion of three- 
quarters of a pound to every pound of fruit, and one pound to every pint 
of water. Peel and pit the plums, add the water, bring to the boiling 
point, add the pineapple cut in dice and boil until soft and thick, then 
add the. sugar and cook three-quarters of an hour longer. 

Spiced Plums. — Spiced plums are the best of re'ishes with game, poul 
try, and mutton. Wash, drain, pick and weigh the plums, prick the skins 
lightly, then pack them down in earthen jars with one-half their own 
w(igh of sugar. Strew through the fruit while packing plenty of whole 
cloves, whole allspice, mace, ginger slightly bruised and stick cinnamon. 
Put in also a few whole black peppercorns, and to each jar allot a single 
pod of the small red pepper. Take half a pint of cider vinegar for each 
pound of fruit, add to it as much sugar as the fruit was packed in, bring 
to a boil, skim well and pour over it scalding hot. Let stand 84 hours, 
then drain off the syrup, boil up, skim and return to the fruit. Do this 
three times, then put fruit and syrup together in the kettle, let them boil 
five minutes, skimming well, fill jars and cover. 

Canned Pumpkin. — This will supply pie material wlipn stored pump- 
kins are gone. Cook the puJiipkin and strain it, just as you do for pies, 
being careful not to have much water in it. Fill the can full. Shake 
down so as to have them solid. Put on the tops, screw down just a 
little, so you can lift by them, place in boiler, with something between 
the cans and boiler on the bottom, fill to the neck of cans with water 
and boil one good hour. Take out and wipe the necks of the cans, and 



THE /iURAL COOK BOOK. 13T 

if the pumpkin liasshrUiik dwi.y, (ill cans up with boiling water, put on 
nngs and screw down the tops tight, and the pumpkin will keep six 
months in n good, cool place. 

Quince Butter. — Use half a gallon of quinces pared and cored, half 
a gallon of tart apples pared and cored, two quarts of sweet cider, one 
pint of cold water. Cover the crock and stew gently until the fruit is 
very soft ; then pass through a sieve. Add five cupfuls of sugar and 
cook until soft. 

Canned Quinces. — Prepare the quinces by paring, coring and quarter- 
ing. Use a silver knife. Keep the prepared quinces in cold water to 
prevent them from discolorifig until sufficient have been prepared. Cook 
the quinces in boiling water slowly till tender. Have ready a syrup of 
one-half pound of sugar and a pint of water to each pound of fruit. Put 
the cooked quinces in the syrup, allowing them to remain five minutes. 
Then can and seal while -hot. 

Quince Honey. — One medium quince and one cupful of granulated 
sugar will make one jelly glass of honey. Pare and grate the quinces, 
then stir this grated pulp into a boiling syrup made of the sugar and 
enough water to dissolve it. Stir slowly and quite often until the pulp 
will remain suspended through the syrup. One should not get it too 
stiff. Put into jelly glasses, and when cool cover in the same way you 
do preserves and jellies, and keep in the preserve closet. 

Quince Jam.— Take one pint of quince juice left from preserves, add 
one pound of sliced apples, three-q.-jarters of a pound of sugar; boil two 
hours, stirring well; pour into g'.asses while hot and seal. 

Quince and Pear Sauce. — Three pounds light brown sugar, six pounds 
pears, quartered if large, small ones cut in halves ; nine pounds quinces, 
quartered. Boil sugar, pears and quinces nearly all day, taking care not 
to let them cook too rapidly, until both pears and quinces are of a rich 
red, and the juice an amber syrup. Can and seal tight. The fruit keeps 
its shape, the pears having gained a fine flavor from the quinces, and the 
quinces having an added goodness from the pears. 

Raisine Bourgogne. — Stem jnd seed two pounds of ripe grapes. Boi! 
with one cup of water until soft. Press through a sieve and add two 
pounds of ripe pears, peeled and sliced; cook until reduced to half the 
amount. Weighi and add an equal amount of sugar, stir until the sugar 
is dissolved, MTain again, put in small earthen jars, set in a plate-warm- 
ing oven for a day or until firm to the touch. Tie down and keep in a 
cool place. 

Raspberry and Currant Bar-le-Duc. — To four pounds of raspberries 
add one pound of currants; bruise the currants and strain the juice; add 
to it three-quarters of a pound of sugar to each pound of juice, including 
the weight of the berries left whole. Boil 20 minutes and skim, add the

raspberries, cook 30 ininut« more When the syrnp jellies on a plate, 
take oS and place in glasses or amall jars while hot 

Canned Raspberries. — (Mm, Mapes's recipe). — First make a syrup by 
boiling seven pounds granulated sugar in 2^/1 quarts water. Fill cans with 
fresh berries, putting in as many as possible without crushing the berries. 
Apply covers without the rubbers, and set in a kettle or boiler of cold 
water, so the water comes about two-thirds of the height of the cans. 
Bring to a boil and cook seven to 10 minutes after boiling begins. Now 
take the cans out of the water, remove the covers, fill with hot syrup 
brimming full, and seal up tight in the usual way. 

Uncooked Canned Rhubarb.— Wash, peel, cut into inch' cubes and 
fill compactly into glass jar, then pour slowly into the jar good fresh 
water to overflowing. Adjust rubber, screw on the top and set away in 
a cool place until morning. Then if there be any air bubbles, tap the 
side of the jar, fill again to the brim with water and screw on cover 
tightly. If tops and rubbers are perfect the rhubarb will keep until used. 

Canned Rhubarb. — Wash it, cut into inch pieces, put in a preserving 
keitle, and let it come to a good boil all through, without a particle 
of sugar. It will keep perfectly. When you wish to open it for use, 
take one cupful of sugar far a pie, and it will be like the fresh' pie plant. 
For a small family, the pint cans are much better for any fruit. ' 

Rhubarb Jam with Ginger. — String some rhubarb, cut into short 
lengths, and weigh. Put into i^ kettle and add just enough w^ter to pre- 
vent burning. When it has become quite soft, add sugar, one pound for 
each pound of rhubarb. Stir well until the jam becomes rich and syrupy. 
For each pound take about a teaspoonful of ground ginger, rub it smooth 
with a little water, and add it to your jam. Boil up jam again, stirring 
well; put into glasses, and when cold cover. If a large amount of rhu- 
barb is at command, a high grade of brown sugar is very good; the only 
difl'erence seems to be that the jam is not quite so clear. 

Rhubarb Jelly.— Make when the rhubarb is tender, using the pink 
variety without peeling it, as much of the flavor and all of the color is 
in the skin. Cook eight pounds of rhubarb with the yellow part of th.! 
peel from three lemons, in a covered dish, until all the juice of the rhu- 
barb is free. Strain, and add all the juice that can be fxtracted from 
the three lemons. Boil half an hour and strain through.. a b^ To 
each cupful of this juice add a cup and a quarter of granulated sugar, 
y which should be heated before putting into the juice. Stir until the 
■ sugar is entirely dissolved, then boil without stirring until it jellies when 
- tested. A fine jelly which may be made later in the season has threc- 
. fnurths of a pound of tart apples (peeled and cored) cut and cooked 
wkl^ each pound of rhubarb. Cook until soft and drain through bag 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 139 

without pressing. Allow a cup of vinegar to each cup of juice and 
proceed as in former recipe. 

Rhubarb and Orange Jam,— To a quart of cut up rhubatt, add tatlf 
a d^en oranges, peeled, cut up and with the pits removed, and a pound 
and a half of sugar. Boil gently until a little set on a plate will jelly. 
This can be varied by slicing the peel of three oranges in thin Strips and 
adding it to the fruit. This jam will also keep indefinitely in earthen 
jars, or jelly glasses which have beer sealed with paraf&n. 

Rhubarb and Pineapple. — The following rule (or canning is a decided 
JTHprovement upon pineapple alone, and the rhubarb taste disappears. 
Chop and cook equal parts of pineapple and rhubarb, and add a cupful 
of sugar for each pint jar. 

Rhubarb Marmalade.— Peel the rhubarb, and cut into pieces one-half 
inch long. Put into a large earthen bowl, and cover with sugar in the 
proportion of one pound of sugar to one quart of rhubarb. Allow this to 
stand over night, or 15 to IS hours. Be sure that the bowl is amply 
large, as there will be a flood of juice by morning. Strain off the juice 
and sugar into a preserving kettle ; when it begins to boil, add the rhu- 
barb. Boil slowly for an hour, or until the preserve assumes a deep • 
red color, .stirring carefully to prevent burning, and removing any scum 
that rises to the top. About IS or 20 minutes before removing from the 
fire, peel the yellow rind from one lemon, chop it fine, and add to the 
preserve, together with the juice of two lemons, this being our usual 
proportion to about (our or five quarts of preserve, but the quantity of 
lemon may be varied to suit the taste. This gives a piquant flavor other- 
wise lacking, in spite of the acidity of the rhubarb. When bottled, keep 
in a cool, dark place. This rhubarb jam is- very nice in open tarts, or as 
a filling for boiled roly puddings. 

RhubarH and Almond Marmalade.— Cut rhubarb up very fine, and to 
each cupful add the pulp and juice of one orange, one teaspoonful of the 
grated yellow of the rind, one tablespoonful lemon juice and one and one- 
half cup of sugar. Let stand until the sugar is dissolved, boil -rapidly 
until transparent, then add one-half cup of blanched almonds cut in 
thin slices, boil up once and put in glasses. 

Hackensack Rhubarb Marmalade.— Cut a pound and a half of rhubarb 
into inch lengths and put it in an earthen dish. Scatter over this a 
quarter of a pound of figs and an ounce of candied peel (both cut fine) ; 
over all sprinkle a pound and a quarter of sugar and let stand over 
night In the morning boil for about 15 minutes, tben add a pound 
of either orange or lemcn pulp, cut fine, and cook untiMheavy enough to 
be firm when cold. Put in jelly glasses, and when cool^oover with paraf- 
fin, or any other material used for keeping air irom jellies. 

Rhubarb and Fig Marmalade.— Three pounds of rhubarb, three poundt 

C;,oo;.|c 



140 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

oi sugar, one pound of figs, juice of one lemon and grated rind of half. 
Wash the figs and cut fine and put in the bottom of the kettle; cut rhu- 
barb into inch cubes and spread evenly over the figs ; over the rhubarb 
distribute one pound of the sugar and let stand over night, la the rflorn- 
ing cook slowly until it looks clear, then add remainder of sugar and cook 
until thick. About fifteen minutes before taking from the stove add 
juice and rind of lemon. This quantity will make two quarts of mar- 
malade. It can be sealed while hot, or put in jelly glasses and covered 
with paraffin. 

Rhubarb and Orange Marmalade. — Three pounds of rhiA«ii,i. four 
iind one-half pounds of sugar, three oranges, the grated rind of one 
orange. After grafing the yi-llow from one orange, remove the peet 
from all three and cut in small pieces. Cut the rhubarb in inch cubes, 
mix with one and one-half pounds of sugar and the oranges and let 
stand twenty-four hours. Cock until it looks clear, then heat the re- 
maining three pounds of sugar, add, and cook until thick. 

Rhubarb and Raisin Marmalade. — Four pounds rhubarb, four oranges. 
. juice of ail, peel of two; four pounds sugar, one lemon, two pounds of 
, raisins. Peel and cut the rhubarb into half-inch pieces., Prepare the 
oranges by squeeiing out juice and cooking the peel in water till tender. 
Drain and scrape out white skin. Extract the juice of the lemon. Put 
the rhubarb into a granite pieserving kettle, heat it slowly to boiling, 
cook fifteen minutes, then add the sugar, orange juice and peel, lemon 
juice and raisins, and cook slowly until thick. 

Spiced Rhubarb. — Peel and slice Z'/i pounds of rhubarb; sprinkle a 
pound of sugar over it and let stand until morning. Drain olT the- syrup 
and add one cup of sugar and half a cupful each of vinegar and water. 
Drop into this syrup small bags filled with a mixture composed of one - 
third of a teaspoonful each of cloves, mace, allspice and ginger, and a 
teaspoonfui of cinnamon. Boil until the syrup begins to thii:ien. then 
take out the bags and add the rhubarb and cook until clear. 

Canned Strawberries. — To can strawberries so that they iwill keep 
llieir shape and color, after the berries are picked over, put them in n 
jar, with a layer of sugar and then of berries until all are used. Set 
them in the cellar over night, and the sugar will penetrate them, and no 
water must be added: there will be sufficient juice. Have a sugar ^rup 
on the stove hot. put the strawberries in -and let them boil up gently; 
then (ill cans with the fruit and juice all cooked together. Screw on 
the cover, stand the can upside down a few minutes, then turn again, 
changing it in this way until it is cool, and the berries will not rise to 
the top. This way preserves the shape, color, and flavor of the fruit. 

Canned Strawberries, No. 8. — An excellent way to can strawberries, 
rstspberries or any fruit that requires little or no cooking is the follow- 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 1« 

ing ; Prepare fruit carefully, discarding att blemished or imperfect berries. 
Prepare a syrup of one quart of water boiled, one cupful of sugar. More 
or less sugar may be added according to the taste of family and the 
acidity of the fruit to be cauned. Have jars thoroughly sterilized as 
above, fill with Ihe prepared fruit, pour over the syrup until it is filled to 
the brim. Screw on cap after adjusting rubber. Place jars in a stone 
crock with thin strips of board or a cloth under them and pour around 
them enough boiling water to fill crock up to the rubbers on jars. Cover 
wi'.h blankets, carpets, etc., to exclude air, and leave over night or until 
the water is cold. Canned in this way soft fruits keep both shape and 
color, and very nearly resemble fresh fruit. Fruits that lose color, such 
ar. strawberries or red raspberries, should have paper bags or pasteboard 
boxes slipped over them to exclude the light. 

Canned Strawberries, No. 3. — Fill a quart jar with large, ripe berries, 
from which the hulls have been taken; fill the jar with cold water; then 
pour It Out again into a measure. For every twelve jars to be put up 
use thirteen of these measurt-s of water and in it dissolve six pounds of 
sugar. Pack the jar with berries as closely as possible without mashing 
them. Fill each jar up to the shoulder with syrup, cover loosely with 
the lid alid set it in a large boiler, which should have a loosely fitting 
wooden bottom pierced with holes. If set on the metal bottom the jars 
are liable to crack. When the boiler is full of jars pour in cold water 
up to their "ihoulders ; cover it and set it on the fire. At the same time 
put the surplus syrup In a saucepan and allow it to become hot. As soon 
as the water in the boiler begins to boil note the time, and when it has 
boiled for eight minutes remove ihe boiler from the tire. Take out one 
jar at a time, fill it even with the hot syrup-in the saucepan, fasten it 
airtight and stand it back in the boiler until all are filled and covered ; 
lei them stand there until cold, and then store in a cool place. 

Uncooked Canned Strawberries. — A correspondent of the Chicago 
Record-Herald says that she has preserved strawberries and red raspber- 
lies without cooking for years with entire success. Her method is as fol- 
lows : Mash together with a silver fork equal quantities of fruit and sugar. 
Lei stand for an hour or more until the sugar is entirely dissolved. 
Then put into jelly glasses or pint jars, filling to the brim. Leave un- 
covered for ^ hours in an open window exposed to the sun. Then seal 
in the usual way and keep in a cool, dark place. The flavor of the ber- 
ries is as when picked, and the jam is rich and delicious. All utensils 
tised must be absolutely clean and jars sterilized. 

Dried Strawberries. — One quart of strawberries, clean off the stem and 
bull. Wash ; add one pound of granulated .sugar, put in a porcelain 
or granitt kettle, iet on stove, and heat gently till they come to a boiling 
point, then boil hard for SO minutes. Do not stir, just ihake the kettle

enongh to keep from burning, then pour out on large plates, and dry 
in the sun for at least three days, or until the juice has become jellied; 
't may take a longer time or a little less according to taea.t of sun. Do 
iiot let them stay out of doors over night, as the ,dew will cause the 
juice to get thin again. When the juice has become jellied, pack in jars 
and make airtight These are most delicious and very delicate in flavor; 
the berries are whole and cleai. 

Strawberry and Currant Jam. — To every pound of fruit allow three- 
quarters of a pound of sugar, also one pint of red currant juice to every 
four pounds of the berries. Boil the currant juice with the strawberries 
for half an hour, stirring all the time, then add the sugar and boil 20 
minutes longer, skimming carefully. Put in small jars or tumblers with 
paraffin on top. The currant juice may be omitted. 

Wiesbaden Strawberries. — Take six pounds of strawberries — they need 
not be large or extra fine, but they must be sound; add to them in the 
kettle a very little cold water and cook slowly as for jelly. Pour in, a 
jelly bag and allow them to drip overnight. In the morning add to the 
juice six pounds of broken loaf or granulated sugar and half a pound 
of strained honey. Boil to a very thick syrup Fill pint cans with freshly 
capped strawberries, the largest and finest to be had. Screw on the tops, 
set in cold water in a large kettle — the wash boiler will do — and let the 
water come to a boil. Open the jars and fill to the brim with the 
hot syrup. Seal and put away in a cool, dark place. 

Tomato Butter. — Cook ripe tomatoes, salt to taste and put them 
through a colander to remove the seeds. Have ready an equal quantity 
of sour apple sauce, well cooked; add it to the tomatoes, sweeten slightly 
and let it boil until the mixture begins to thicken. Be careful that it does 
not burn. Seal in jelly glasses. Excellent to serve with meats. 

Tomato Butter No. 2.— Seven pounds of large, ripe tomatoes, four 
pounds of brown sugar, half a cupful of vinegar, one teaspoonful of 
cinnamon, one teaspoonful of cloves. Pour boiling water over the toma- 
toes ; let stand live minutes, then the skins can be rubbed off. Remove 
stem end, then slice tomatoes. Cook until soft, add the sugar and stew 
until very thick; then add spices and vinegar. Let simmer 30 minutes, 
pour into jars and seal. 

Tomato and Apple Butter. — Scald and skin ripe tomatoes, add a 
quarter of the quantity of pared, cored and quartered pleasant sour 
apples. Weigh the kettle, put in the tomatoes and apples and cook to the 
consistency of marmalade, then to every six pounds add a teaspoonful of 
ginger, the juice of a large lemon and four pounds of light brown sugar; 
boil fifteen minutes, or until it will spread smoothly. 

Green Tomato Butter. — Select tomatoes that are full grown, but quite 
freen. Slice them thin. Make a syrup in proportion of ope pound oi 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. Itf 

■ngw to two pounds of tomatoei. Boil down stowljr for four hours or 
until the butter is smooth and thick, stirring freqnenttr to prevent stick- 
ing. Flavor with lemon when done. 

Green Tomato Conserve. — For one peck of green tomatoes, slice six 
lemons without removing the skin, but taking out the seeds. Put to this 
quantity six pounds of sugar and boil until transparent and the syrup 
thick. Ginger root may be added if liked. 

Tomato Jam. — Select sound, ripe fruit and peel and quarter them. 
Then put Uiem into the preserving kettle with an equal weight of loaf 
sugar, the strained juice and rind of a lemon for every four pounds of 
the fruit, and a little powdered ginger. Cook the iflixture slowly until 
it jellies when tried on a spoon. Turn into jars and cover. 

Tomato Marmalade. — Remove the skin from four quarts of ripe 
tomatoes and slice. Cut six large lemons in halves, lengthwise, and slice 
very thin. Seed one cup of raisins. Put the tomatoes, raisins and 
lemons into a preserving kettle, in layers, alternating with four pounds 
of granulated sugar. Cook one hour on the front of stove. Then set 
the kettle back, and allow contents to simmer until it is of the consistency 
of marmalade. Put up, while hot, as jelly. This recipe makes about 
two and one-half quarts. When properly prepared Bo one article will be 
recognizable. The small yellow tomatoes are nice for. such use. 

Tomato Marmalade No. 2. — For every two pounds of the tomatoes 
allow two pounds of sugar and the juice and grated rind of one lemon. 
Pour scalding water over the tomatoes to loosen the slcins. After remov- 
ing the skin, mix the tomatoes with the sugar and boil slowly for one 
hour, stirring and skimming frequently. At the epd of that time add 
the lemon juice and rind and cook another hour or until the whole is 
a thick, smooth mass. 

Tomato Mock-Orange Marmalade.— Scald and peel large-sized yellow 
tomatoes. Cut downward over each seed section, press open and remove 
all seeds with the thumb, leaving the pulp comparatively whole. To two 
parts of the prepared tomatoes allow one part of oranges, slicing thinly. 
Cover all with an equal quantity of sugar and let stand over ntght In 
the morning pour off syrup and cook down about half, add the tomatoes 
and oranges and cook until the orange skins are transparent Seal in 
jelly glasses. This is an original recipe, and is a delightful substitute 
, for the genuine orange marmalade, though much cheaper. 

Tomato Mincemeat — Chop fine four quarts of green tomatoes, drain 
off juice, cover with cold water and bring to a boil, scalding for 30 
ininutes, then drain. Repeat till parboiled three times. Add two pounds 
brown sugar, one pound seeded raisins, one-half pound chopped citron, 
one large half cup chopped suet, one tablespoonful salt and one-half cup 



144 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

strong vinegar. Mix and cook until thick. When cold add one tea- 
spoonful each of ground cinnamon and cloves, and one tablespoonful of 
grated nutmeg (or suit taste). Mix iboroughly, and keep in open jar. 

Tomato Clove Preserves. — To four pounds of yellow plum tomatoes, 
not too ripe, allow (our pounds of sugar, three lemons and one -half 
ounce (or according to tasie) of whole cloves. Peel the tomatoes with- 
out breaking, sprinkle sugar over and let them stand over night. In the 
morning pour off the syrup, add the cloves and let it boil until thick, then 
strain. Return to fire and add the chopped pulp of the lemons, rejecting 
the skin, and Ihc tomatoes, and cook gently until the tomatoes look clear. 
Put into jars and smI. To give a quite different flavor substitute one- 
half ounce of ginger root for the cloves, and proceed as above. 

Green Tomato Preserves.— Required, eight pounds of small green 
tomatoes, seven pounds of sugar, one ounce of ginger and mace mixed, 
and the juice of four lemons. Pierce each of the tomatoes with a fork 
and put them in the preserving kettle with all the other ingredients. Heat 
slowly, then boil until the tomatoes are clear, then skim them out and boil 
the syrup until thick. Put the tomatoes into jars and pour in the 
hot syrup. 

Yellow Tomato Preserves. — Put the tomatoes into a wire basket and 
plunge' into boiling water to loosen the skins. When a cut is made across 
jhe skin its whole contents can be quickly squeezed out. Three-fourths 
cf a pound of sugar is allowed for each pound of the fruit pulp, and 
sometimes ginger root is added for flavoring. Prolonged cooking is not 
necessary; just before ready for the jars add several lemons sliced in 
thin even circles. 

Ruby Watermelon Preserves. — Dice the red portion of the melofc, 
removing all seeds and every bit of the white part; weigh and use halt 
as much sugar as you have melon, adding to every six pounds of melon 
the juice and grated yellow rinds of two lemons. Put all together in B 
large granite kettle and boil slowly, stirring often until it is quite thick; 
at first you will think it is all going to water, but very soon you will 
notice it thicken nicely; when it has become as thick as you like it, seal 
hot in glass pint jars. 



JELLIES. 

, Jelly should never be stored in a cellar. It demands a cool, dry, dark 
place, which can be well ventilated, to insure its keeping perfectly. Great 
care must be given the juice, sugar, etc. The glasses should be hot, dry 
and clean (surgically clean, we mean). Small tapering cups or bowls 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 145 

make jelly a nicer shape to turn out to serve, but the regulation jelly glass 
with its tin top conies much cheaper. 

A safe rule wirh all fruits that do not get firm is to add suHicient sour 
apple juice to malte the jelly the right consistency. By choosing a bright 
day, boiling the juice 20 minutes before adding the sugar and going strictly 
according to directions even an amateur can have success. The best 
jellies are not boiled as hard as wanted but sunned under glass for 
several days. 

For filling the glasses, use a china cup with a handle. A saucer or 
^mall plate held in the left hand and moved with and under the cup will 
catch all drops. In case you do not fill a tumbler full from the first dip 
add the requisite quantity immediately afterward, so that all will stiffen 
together, otherwise there may be separation in the contents tjf the tumbler 
when it is turned out. As a general rule for jelly, wash and drain the 
fruit, then put it on the stove in a large stone crock. Or in a granite 
vessel. The fruit should be mature, but not overripe. Add no water 
to small and juicy fruits. Large fruits, such as apples, peaches and pears, 
require some water; our rule is to put the fruit in the crock, and pour in 
enough water to show at the top. Cook slowly, but thoroughly, stirring 
the fruit, which will thus be sufficiently mashed. Strain through a flannel 
bag, which should be scalded fir^t, or through a stout cotton or linen ; the 
flannel insures clearness, but wt have no trouble with this when properly, 
boiled, nor do we add white of egg. as some cooks recommend. Most 
people advise letting the fruit drain over night, and boiling the next day, 
but we think it jellies better if the fruit is cooked, drained, and the juice 
boiled the same day. The bag is of course hung over a large china bowl, 
and pressed down a little with a wooden spoon ; its own weight, however, 
soon drains jl dry. The juice is measured, and put on to boil ; granulated 
sugar is measured, cup for cup, and put in a bowl on the back of the 
stove, where it is heated, being stirred from time to time, so that by the 
lime the juice boils tt is well healed through. Any scum that arises is 
skimmed off, and as soon as the juice comes to a boil the warmed sugar 
is stirred in. Continue to skim it as needed, and notice when it comes 
to a boil. Currant jelly made in this way will qnly need three minutes' 
bailing; other small fruits a little longer; they should be tested in a little 
cup. If boiled too long jelly becomes ropy. If boiled too hard, so that 
sugar crystallizes on the sides of the kettle, which is stirred in afterwards, 
the jelly may candy. In making jdly from fruit to which water has been 
added, as crab apple, tt is measured, and three-quarters the amount of 
sugar put to heat. When put ir. the kettle, the depth of juice is measured 
with a stick, on which are two notches, one for the original depth, and 
one for two-thirds the amount. As soon as the juice has boiled down 
one-third add the warmed sugar, and boil. 



IM THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Apple Jdly.— W« like Fall Pippini for this purpose, but Gravetuteiii 
or any other highly-flavored apple, nearly ripe, makes a fine jelly. The 
jelly is excellent without any additional flavoring, but we prefer to add 
Rose geranium leaves, which render it delicious ; four leaves to a quart 
of jelly. The leaves are put in with the sugar, and taken out when the 
jelly is put in glasses. Another variation is made by using three whole 
cloves to a quart of jelly; Ihis imitates the nutmeg jelly made in Trinidad, 
the spiciness being so faint that it does not overpower the fruit flavor. 
To prepare apples for jelly, wipe them with a damp cloth, remove the 
stem and blossom ends and cut in quarters. Put in granite or porcelain- 
lined preserve kettle, and for three pounds of apples ad^ one pint of 
water. Cover and cook slowly until apples are soft; mash, then drain 
through a coarse sieve. Do not squeeze, or jelly will be cloudy. Next 
allow juice to drip through a double thickness of cheesecloth or flannel 
jelly bag. Or they may be turned directly into jelly bag and allowed to 
drip over night Measure juice, boil 20 minutes, and add an equal quan- 
tity of heated granulated sugar, boil five minutes, skim and turn into 
glasses that have been dipped into scalding water and placed on a wet 
cloth. Put a silver spoon in the tumbler before turning the jelly in as 
another means of avoiding cracking the glass ; it can be moved from 
tumbler to tumbler as you proceed. Pll brimming full, as the jelly will 
shrink as it cools. The glasses may now be placed in a sunny window, 
protected from dust, and let stand for 24 hours. Cover with melted 
parafiin, poured directly on to the jelly; then seal as usual. 

Apple Combination. — A housewife who has tried it says that a deli- 
cious combination jelly is made by cooking a half peck each of apples 
and quinces and a quart of cranberries together until soft, after barely 
covering with water. Strain, and to every pint of juice allow a scant pint 
of sugar, then proceed as with other jellies. It is delicately flavored, and 
a beautiful pink in color. 

Barberry Jelly. — For domestic use the berries should not be gathered 
until well frosted. For jelly the fruit need not be stripped from the stems. 
Put the fruit in a porcelain kettle with water to come to the top of the 
berries and boil until thoroughly cooked, then put into a jelly bag and 
drain out the juice; return the juice to the kettle and boil hard 15 minutes. 
Measure it before boiling down. Add a pound of sugar to each pint and 
boil rapidly 10 minutes, then put away in glasses. This is an excellent 
jelly to serve with meat. 

Blackberry Jelly. — Make the same as currant jelly.. 

Crab-apple Jelly. — Wash, cut in pieces two gallons of crab apples ; 
place in the preserving kettle, just cover with cold water and cook until 
the pieces are tender. Drain through cheesecloth, measure, and when 
the juice has boiled 10 minutes, stir in one pound white sugar to tack

pint of jaice. Boil hard until it is jelly; about 10 minutes' boiling after 
tbe sugar has been added. Now take the tender pieces left after straining, 
rub through a sieve or colander ; fo each pint of pulp add one-half as 
much sugar. Cook until the sugar is thoroughly blended with the putp, 
stirring quite frequently. Add spices if preferred, fill into glass cans, seal, 
and take to the cellar when cool. This makes a delicious butter, almost 
a marmalade, and is very nice in the Winter with pork. Two gallons of 
crab apples will make six glasses of jelly and five or six quarts of butter 
with the addition of 11 pounds of sugar. Crab apple will mix well with 
wild grapes for jelly. The two fruits should be cooked t<^ether, and 
made like any other jelly. The proportion may be whatever is most 
convenient; half and half, or one-third grapes to two-thirds apples, will 
be found excellent. 

Wild Crab-apple Jelly. — Cook the cored crabs till tender and drip in a 
jelly bag. Use more sugar than for ordinary jelly — about five cups of 
sugar to four of juice — and cook quickly. This is delicious both in 
color and flavor. 

Mrs. C.'s Currant Jelly; — The currants are picked over as if for 
canning, then put in the preserving kettle. As the fruit heats, it is mashed 
vrith a large spoon until juice is pretty nearly all extracted. The juice 
Is all dipped off and her jelly is made according to the common recipe. 
She now adds to the currants left in kettle an equal amount of raspber- 
lles — either black or red is added, and jam is made by the addition of 
three- fourths of a pound of granulated sugar to each pound of fruit. 
In this way she says jelly making is an easy task, and she also has the 
consciousness of having used every bit of the currants. 

Elderberry Jelly. — Strip the ripe berries into the kettle and stir over 
the fire with a wooden spoon until the juice flows freely; turn into a 
jelly bag and let drain without touching so as not to become cloudy. 
Weigh and boil sharply 15 minutes. Remove from fire and add sugar, 
allowing 14 ounces to one pint of juice. Boil 15 minutes, stirring and 
skimming until it jellies. This is an English recipe and a very good one. 

Elderberry Jelly No. 3, — Take equal parts of elderberries and wild 
grapes, and cook to extract juice, strain, add sugar in proportion of one 
pound to each pint of liquid, and cook as other jelly. This is especially 
nice. for invalids, and beneficial in cases of sore throat. 

Grape Jelly. — The wild grapes gathered just as they begin to turn are 
the best for jelly. Free them from their stems and wash them, mash 
them, and heat slowly; cook them until the juice is well drawn out; turn 
into a flannel bag and let it drip without pressure ; measure the juice, and, 
if cultivated grapes are used, allow an equal amount of sugar; if the wild 
grape, allow a little more than an equal measure. Heat the sugar (put in 
a pan in the oven and stir often) ; boil the strained juice 15 minutes; skim 



148 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

and strain again, add the sugar, boil until the surface loots wrinkled, skim 
well and turn into glasses. 

Green Grape Jelly. — Select the grapes when full grown, just before 
they begin to turn purple. After separatii« from the stem, wash, adding 
a little water if the grapes are not very juicy. Mash and slew until the 
skins are cooked. Strain first through the colander, then through the jelly 
bag. Measure the juice, measure the same amount of sugar, putting it in 
the oven white the jutce is b£ing boiled. The boiling will take half an 
hour. Now add the hot sugar, wluch you must be careful not to scorch, 
boil about five minutes longer, and then the jelly should be ready to pour 
in glasses. Jelly made from the green grapes is solid, of a delicious flavor 
and of a pretty green tint. 

Spiced Grape Jelly. — This is delicious served with cold meats. Take 
equal amounts of grape juice and sugar. Add one-half teaspoonful of 
ground cloves and one tablespoonfuJ of cinnamon to each quart of juice. 
Add the sugar as directed in recipe above. 

Marble Jelly. — A dark jelly, such as blackberry or grape, is poured into 
a half-gallon crock; as soon as this hardens a hght jelly, apple, quin,;e or 
pear, is poured on top ; so on in alternate layers until the crock is filled. 
The layers look prettiest when but an inch thick. Slice in half-inch slices, 
serve on a pretty glass dish. Besides being unique in appearance the 
blending of flavors is decidedly appetizing. 

Peach Jelly.— Take sound, high-flavored, barely ripe peaches. Wash 
thern thoroughly. Use the parings and a few pieces of fruit. Boil in 
enough water to cover in an enameled kettle until the skins are tender 
and broken. Strain through a jelly bag. Allow the juice of one lemon 
and one scant pound of sugar to each pint of juice. Boil the juice twenty 
minutes after straining, and meantime heat the sugar in the oven. Pot 
the sugar into the juice slowly, let boil five minutes and pour into tumblers. 

Peach Jelly No. 2. — Take the peach parings from a peck or two of 
peaches and simmer with sour apples till the whole mass is tender. Have 
twice the quantity of peach that you have of apple and make your jelly 
in the ordinary way. 

Pear Jelly, — Select juicy pears that are not top ripe, quarter, core and 
cut in small pieces without paring. Put in a kettle with one pint of 
water to every four pounds of pears. . Cook over a slow fire to a Jiulp, 
turn into a jelly bag which has been wrung out, and let drip without 
squeeiing. Measure the juice and allow the same quantity of sugar. Put 
the liquid over the fire, bring to the boiling point and boil 20 minutes. In 
the itwantime heat the sugar by spreading it out on pans and setting it in 
an open oven ; when the pear juice has boiled twenty minutes add the 
heated sugar, stir until it is dissolved, bring again to the boiling point, 
and boil until in dropping a spoonful on a cold saucer a skin forms 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. HO 

quickly over it; this will generally occur after five or ten minutes' boiling. 
Take from the fire and pour into jelly glasses. Let stand until cold, pour 
over the top of each glass a little melte^ parafHn, and when it hardens 

Plum Jelly. — Pour boiling water over one-half peck of plums placed 
in a colander. Then put them in a preserving kettle, pour over them just 
enough water to cover and boil until the plums have become soft and 
the juice has flowed out. Drain through a colander, then through a jelly 
bag without squeezing. Measure juice and put to boil in preserve kettle. 
Add one dozen blanched plum kernels. Allow an equal measure of 
granulated sugar and put it to heat in shallow pans in the oven. When 
the juice has boiled 20 minutes skim well, add the hot sugar, stir until 
dissolved, let come to the boiling point, take immediately from the fire 
and fill into glasses which have been rolled in boiling water, drained and 
stood upright on a cloth folded in a shallow pan of boiling water. Use 
a small teacup to dip the jelly into the tumblers, and fill them very full. 
Cover airtight next day. The pulp remaining may be used to make a 
little marmalade, allowing three-quarters of a. pint of sugar to one pint 
of pulp, and a few blanched kernels from the plum stones. 

Plum and Green Grape Jelly, — Plums mixed with green grapes make' 
the most delicious of all tart jellies. Small yellow plums are the best. 
Wash, pick and scald the'm with their own bulk of green grapes picked 
from the stem, strain out the juice, let it settle 10 minutes, then pour it 
carefully off the sediment. Put in a shallow kettle over a quick fire, boil 
for five minutes, skimming well; then add for each pint of juice a pound 
and a quarter of very hot granulated sugar; stir hard until the sugar 
dissolves ; then skim again and boil hard for two minutes. Drop a little 
in ice water — the minute this hardens take it off the tire and pour into 
hot glasses. 

Plum and Peach. — Japan plums not quite ripe, with a few peaches, 
make a nice clear amber jelly. 

Quince Jelly.— Simmer the quinces in a stone jar till tender in enough 
water toi cover them. Drip and strain the juice atid boil 20 minutes before 
adding, an almost equal amount of sugar. This will be a beautiful color 
if wel' made and have a delicate flavor. 

'Quince Jelly No. 2. — Place the parings and cores left from preserving 
in the preserving kettle, cover with cold water and cook until the parings 
are soft ; strain through cheesecloth, measure, and when boiling hard, put 
a pound of white sugar to each pint of the juice. Boil hard unjil it will 
set Ten minutes of bard boiling is usually enough ; then pour into 

Quince and Cranberry. — Stew cores and skins of quinces In very little 
water, and strain the juice as for quince jelly; stew tart cranberrie* 



wo THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

separately in very little water, strain, and combine with an equal propor- 
tion of quince juice. Add to the combined juices one cupful of sugar to 
each cupful of juice, and boil briskly until it jellies. 

Raspberry Jelly. — One of our friends tells us with pride that she made 
delicious stiff raspberry jelly last year by mixing the red raspberries with 
an equal quantity of green grapes. The two fruits were cooked together, 
then strained as usual. The resulting jelly was clear red, with full rasp- 
berry flavor. Our friend had never been able to make raspberries "jell" 
properly before, so she was much pleased with the experiraent It is 
quite possible that green grapes would stiffen strawberry jelly, which is 
usually difficult to harden. Some experimenters say they mix either red 
currants or early apples with strawberries to make jelly. If raspberries 
and Summer apples are available at the same time, a combination of the 
two will make an excellent jelly. Cook and strain separately, then mix 
the juice, and proceed as with any other jelly. Raspberry and red cur- 
rants mixed are excellent. 

Rhubarb Jelly. — On account of the watery consistency of the fruit it 
cannot be made info jelly as readily as most fruit. A fine jelly and one 
specially suitable for serving with game can be made if the following 
directions are observed : Let the rhubarb heat on the back of the stove 
until the juice flows freely. Strain the juice through a jelly bag. Do not 
squeeze the bag into the jelly, but use only what will drip of itself. The 
bag can be squeezed into a different vessel, and the liquid thus gained can 
be re-added to the pulp of the rhubarb and made into jam. Take the 
rhubarb juice and boil gently for 10 minutes. Measure and to each pint 
allow a pound of granulated sugar. Boil until a little poured out on a 
cold plate will set nicely. Do not measure the juice before it has been 
boiled. Such treatment is needed to reduce the water and make the pure 
juice and sugar jelly properly. If care is taken in the boiling of the 
jelly, it turns out a pretty color and is very desirable for garnishing 
various dishes. 

, Rhubarb Jelly No. 2. — Cut off the leaves and ends from the stalks, 
and wipe with a clean, damp cloth. Use an earthen dish for cooking. 
Without removing the skins, cut the rhubarb into pieces 2^ inches long, 
and put over them lH cupful of sugar, a piece of lemon peel, and a pint 
of water, this proportion to two pounds of rhubarb. Cover and set in 
the oven on a shelf. Moisten a half ou»ce of white gelatine in a quarter 
of a cupful of cold water. When the rhubarb is tender put the gelatine 
in a large bowl, on which an earthen colander is placed. Pour the 
rhubarb on this, but remove it very soon to a dish, in order to retain 
sufficient juice with it. Stir the hot liquid underneath, and when the 
gelatine is dissolved pour into teacups or molds dipped tn cold water. 
Strawberry Jelly.— To 10 quarts of strawberries add two quarts oi 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. Ul 



, and proceed as for currant jelly, but boil Ifi i 
use apple juice instead of currants. 

Tomato Jelly. — Simmer yellow tomatoes without water till pulpy and 
then drip in a bag. Take equal parts of tomato and apple juice and 
proceed in the ordinary way. 

Watermelon Jelly. — Mash the heart of a dead-ripe melon and strain 
the juice so obtained. Boil to a thick syrup with equal parts of granu- 
lated sugar and add to apple juice; then proceed as for apple jelly. 

We always pour melted paraSin over the top of our jelly before 
putting the cover on. Break the paraSin in pieces, put in a, cup, and set 
the cup in a pan of warm water on the back of the stove; it will soon 
melt enough to pour.- It should be one-fonrth inch thick over the jelly; 
if too thin it cracks. If you' have reason to fear mold, cut disks of white 
paper to fit the top of the glass ; dip in brandy or grain alcohol, and pour 
the paraffin over this. If the room or closet in which jelly is stored is 
tikmp. Prof. Conn recommends setting a few lumps of unslaked lime about 
on the shelves, removing when they crumble. 



CANDIED FRUITS. 

■ Cherries. — Get large, sound cherries and cut off the stem to avoid tear- 
ing the fruit. Wipe with a soft cloth. Weigh the cherries and then 
weigh out an equal amount of fine sugar. Sprinkle a little sugar over the 
cherries and let them stand over night. With the rest of Ihe sugar make a 
thick syrup and let that stand over night. In the morning bring the syrup 
to boiling heat ; put the cherries in and boil for live minutes. Let them 
stand together for 34 hours, drain off the syrup and boil long enough to 
get rid of the juice from the cherries (until a thick syrup as it was at 
first) and pour over the cherries. The next morning drain off the syrup 
and boil to candy degree. Dip each cherry in this and put on a sieve, in 
a warm place to dry. When perfectly dry pack in glass, or in boxes with 
waxed paper between layers. 

Oranges. — Peel the oranges and separate the sections without breaking 
the white skin that covers them. Place on plates and keep where it is 
warm until dry. Make a syrup with granulated sugar; boil until it will 
thread and then add two tablespoon fuls of vinegar for each pound of 
sugar used. Boil until it begins to turn straw-colored. The instant this 
change of color shows lift the pan and set it in a pan of boiling water. 
Now take the sections of orange on a greased fork; dip them carefully 
in the syrup, and drop on waxed paper to dry. Lay the orange on the 
fork, never stick the fork through the skin. If the syrup begins to harden 
it may be heated again. Don't stir the syrup at any stage of the work, 



153 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

and when dipping the orange do it gently, or the syrup will be spoiled, and 
for this reason it is not advisable lo use more than a pound of sugar at 

Peaches, — Pare and halve enough large peaches lo weigh two pound^. 4! 
Make a syrup with one-half a pound of sugar and a cup of water ^ 
boiling together for five minutes. Drop the fruit in and cook gently pnti] 
tender, then drain out and spread on plates. Boil the syrup until fairly 
thick and pour over the fruit, ^ace the plates in a warm oven ; turt( the 
fruit over frequently until dry. Roll each piece in granulated. sugar tnd 
put in hot sunshine. Let stand in sun an hour or two. When cooled 
pack in layers between waxed paper. 

Pineapple.— Get the finest fruit to be had; pare and cut into the thin- 
nest possible slices. Weigh, and allow a pound of sugar to each pound of 
fruit. Spread sliced fruit on platters and sprinkle the sugar over it. Keep 
in a warm place for a week— or until dry — then put in a hot oven for y) 
minutes. When cold, pack between waxed papers. 

Quinces. — Boil fruit until tender in as little water as possible (may 
be steamed) and put through a sieve. Weigh the sifted fruit and to each 
pound of fruit allow a pound of sugar. Put fruit and sugar together 
and boil until very thick. Spread on plates; dry in oven or sun; cut in 
bars; roll in sugar; dry again, and pack like the others described, or wrap 
each bar in waxed paper. Tin boxes are fine for packing away these 
fruits, but small tin pails will serve the purpose equally well. Glass cans 
are good so far as keeping quality goes, but are not so easy to use. 

CANNING VEGETABLES. 

Vegetables for canning should be fresh gathered, and of the highest 
quality, just in the right condition for eating. 

Asparagus.— Straight-sided quart glass jars, such as the "Royal," should 
be used for asparagus, so as to avoid breaking the stalks. Wash care- 
fully, cut the right length lo stand the whole stalk upright in the jar 
and pack in snugly, heads up; then pour in cold water slowly, until the 
jar is full to overflowing, and lay on the tops. Place straw or boards in 
the bottom of the wash-boiler, stand the jars on this, and pour in enough 
cold water to come half way up the jars; put the boiler over the fire, and 
when the water comes to a boil, boil steadily for three hours. Take up 
the jars, see that they are full to overflowing (if not fill up with boiling 
water) put on rubbers and screw or otherwise fasten the covers tight 
Keep in a cool, dark place. Another recipe recommends boiling the 
asparagus for* 15 minutes, then putting in the jar, and boiling in the 
wash-boiler for V/i hour, but we think some of the stalks are very 
likely to be broken by this method.

Beans.—String beans are cut in lengths, boiled for 10 minutes, then 
■: put into cans, which are stood in a kettle of water and boiled for two 
>■ liours. Add a teaspoonful of salt, hll the jar to overflowing with boiling 

I water, screw up, and keep in a cool dark place. Another plan is as 
follows : Wash and break each pod in two or three pieces, put on the 
\ Move In a saucepan of cold salt water and when it just commences to 
1 bubble (don't let it boil) drain the beans out and put in cans that have 
t been washed and scalded. Hav& ready another saucepan of boiling salt 
1 water and fill the cans nearly to the brim, leaving just room enough for 
; one tablespoonful of hot vinegar, screw on the caps and set away. When 
t wanted for use pour off the brine and put in a saucepan of fresh water 
j with a pinch of soda added ; let them come to a boil and immediately 
i pour off the water, then cook as you would fresh beans. 
1 Dried Siring Beans,— When fit for the table pick and prepare them 
i by removing Ihe strings and breaking up into inch pieces ; put into a 
[ kettle of cold water and then bring to a scakHng heat. Skim out, spread 
q ) on plates and dry in the oven or out of doors until all moisture is 
I removed. Put away in bags until snow flies, then take out a quart and 
soak in cold water over night. Next morning boil with a good-sized 
[piece of sweet salt pork until tender. 

i Beets, — Young beets are delicious canned; cook until tender in salted 
[water the same as for table use. Cut in thin slices, fill the cans and cover 
|with hot vinegar, sweetened and spiced, seal, 

Caulifiower. — Cauliflower may be canned either in vinegar or water. 
' I Break into flowerets and cook until tender in a small quantity of water, 
tpack the cans as full as possible, add the salt, and fill 1o overflowing with 
■hot liquor in which it was cooked, seal. When vinegar is used, steam the 
^cauliflower until tender, 611 into cans and piiur over hot vinegar, sweet- 
'ened and spiced. 

' Corn. — For canned corn cut the kernels off the cob with a sharp 

'. Jcnife, scraping out the pulp. Fill into Ihe can a little at a lime, pressing 

■it down firmly until the milk overflows the can. Add a teaspoonful of 

salt. When all are tilled place the cans in a boiler and cook half an 

' iiour with the covers laid loosely on. Remove from the fire and seal, 

-•■ Jhen cook two hours longer. The preliminary cooking permits the corn 

lo swell without endangering the cans, which may burst if tightly sealed 

*rom the first. Succotash is canned by first half filling the cans with 

green Lima beans, then filling the remainder of the can with com, 

pressed down firmly. Add a teaspoonful of salt to each can, and cook 

like corn. 

Salted Corn. — This recipe has been highly endorsed by readers who 
iiave tried it. Have com "jnst right" for eating. While it may be 
t)roiight from the field the previous evening it should not be prepared 



IS* THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

otherwise until the following morninfr. as there is danger of its souring. 
Clean and scald your boiler thoroughly and fill with the com properly 
husked and silked, discarding all ears either over or under ripe. Cook 
as for the table. Removing from the boiler, score each row of kernels 
with a sharp knife and shave off not too close to the cob. After cutting 
from cob, measure and to each eight pints of corn add one pint of salt 
and mix thoroughly with the hands until a brine is formed. Have ready 
a well-scalded and clean crock and pack corn in this as it is mitred. 
When jar is filled within one inch of top, cover with a clean white cloth 
large- enough to hang over edge of crock. On this cloth put about an 
inch of salt, and on the salt a plate that fits the top of jar. Now it is 
ready to put in the cellar or any cool place for Fall and Winter use, but 
in its preparation for the table lies the secret of- Its success. There is 
only one way of making it palatable, but with directions strictly adhered 
to it is preferred by many to canned corn. About one and one-half hour 
before the meal at which one wishes to serve it it must be brought from 
the cellar^ — enough for one meal— and cold water enough to cover poured 
on and at once poured off. Then sufficient boiling water is poured on to 
cover and it is allowed to stand on the back of the range for 15 minutes. 
This water is drained off and. sufficient fresh boiling water poured on to 
cover and the same time allowed. This process is repeated twice more, 
in all four times. Then cream, butter, sugar and if liked a little pepper 
is added. In short after pouring off the water for the fourth time it is 
prepared exactly as canned corn. The process of removing the salt by a 
swift boiling water process instead of a slow cotd water process seems 
to leave the corn as fresh as when taken from the cob. This, together 
with the case with which it is prepared— so much easier and surer than 
canning — makes the process ideal. 

Southern Dried Corn.— Sew firmly into a quil ting-frame a strot^ 
sheet Gather the com when ready for use, husk and remove silk. Put 
on in boiler, cover with water and when it starts boiling let cook well 
for 10 or 15 minutes. Take off, allow it to cool some, then score and cut 
off, but not too close, to have it shucky, and scrape off what remains on 
ear. Have your frame out in a sunny place, spread corn evenly upon it, 
cover with a mosquito netting and it will dry quickly in this way, as it 
dries from below just as fast as above. Then at some convenient time 
when the oven is piping hot put it in the oven to heat well through in 
order to kill any chance "microbe." When it comes time to cook the 
dried corn wash well in water. Put to soak in milk over night and cook 
in the milk it soaked in; season with sugar, salt, pepper and butter, and 
you will find it very good and know that it is clean. 

Uncooked Canned Corn. — Prepare corn by removing husks and silk; 
break into pieces large enough to fit into two-quart cans. Season cold 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 15S 

water with just enough salt to taste. Then fill the cans up with this 
salt water; have new rubbers for cans, and when you have got the air 
bubbles all out seal your cans and stand them iqtside down to see that 
they do not leak. If they do not your corn will keep all right. Some 
cut it off and can same wa.y, but always fill the can first and then put 
in the salt water. We are told that this corn keeps perfectly. 

Feas. — To can peas, fill the jars full of peas, uncooked; then fill. 
with cold water, and lay on the tops. Place straw or boards in the 
bottom of the wash boiler, stand the jars on this, and pour enough cold 
water in the boiler to come half way up the jars. Put the boiler on the 
stove with the lid tightly closed, and boil three hours. When the jars 
are taken out, see that they are full to overflowing, and screw the lid 
on tight. Another method of preparing peas is to cook five minutes 
in very little water, then fill the cans, and place them in the boiler to 
cook for one' hour. A teaspoonful of salt is added the last thing before 
sealing. 

Dried Peas. — Green peas are dried as follows: Shell the peas, put 
them in boiling water, and boil for five minutes. Drain, then spread out 
in shallow trays, and dry in the sun, or near the stove. When dry, store 
away in paper bags, in a dry place. The peas should be soaked before 
using; then boiled in salted water. 

Tomatoes. — Scald to remove the skins, put in the jars whole or halved, 
fill up with cold water; stand the jars in the wash boiler, boil 30 minutes, 
and seal. Do not use any overripe or fermenting fruit. The main things 
to observe in canning vegetables are that the jars are filled to overflow- 
ing; that they are hermetically sealed, while hot, and that they are stored 
in a cool, dry place. Vegetables, like fruits, should be taken tn their 
regular order and canned while in the best passible condition. 

Tomatoes Canned Whole. — Select firm, smooth fruit, not overripe. 
and of a size to slip into the ordinary fruit jar. Peel without breaking 
and with as little scalding as possible. Have ready a preserving kettle 
full of water, which has been salted slightly, only enough to taste. Just 
before the water reaches the boiling point drop the tomatoes into it, one 
layer at a time and heat through. Do not allow the water to boil at 
any time. When thoroughly heated transfer tomatoes to the cans, being 
careful not to bruise them. Fill the cans with the hot, salted water, and 
screw the tops on quickly. Turn the cans over in a deep kettle of hot 
water until the rubbers are heated and set, which hermetically seals the 
cans. In using drain from the salt water, and serve exactly as fresh 
tomatoes.

CHAPTER XII. 

PirKI.BS A'ND RBI.ISHFIH. 

Amber Pickles. — Choose small yellow pear tomatoes when just turn- 
ing to ripen. Prick each tomato with a needle three times to prevent : 
bursting in cooking, and soak half an hour in sa'.ted water. Take out ' 
and put in jars, after which make a syrup of one pint of vinegar, three- . 
quarters of a pound of C sugar and a pinch of salt, and put to boil in 
a porcelain kettle. Take one-halt dozen cloves, same of whole allspice, 
one peppercorn, a piece of cinnamon, a splinter of mace and a chip of 
ginger root ; tie all in a cheesecloth bag and boil ten minutes in the 
sjTup. Remove spice bag and put the tomatoes in the kettle until tbey 
are heated through (do not let boil), take out with skimmer and put 
in jars. Boil syrup 20 minutes longer and pour hot over tomatoes. Next 
day pour off syrup, reheat and pour over tomatoes, and seal in jars. 

Apple Pickle. — Eighteen gcod sharp apples; one-quarter pound best . 
ginger; one pound Sultana raisins; one ounce mustard seed; six shallots; ■ 
one-quarter pound salt; I'A pound moist sugar; six good-sized onitow; 
one-half ounce smalt chilli peppers; one-half teaspoon cayenne pepper. 
Three pints white wine vinegar. Pare and quarter apples and place in a . 
double boiler, cover tightly to keep in steam, cook til! quite soft; chop 
onions and shallots, and boil in vinegar until they are soft also. Then 
mix ingredients together, and place in an iron saucepan, no other metal 
will do. Boil for three-quarters of an hour, stirring faithfully, as, it 
burns very quickly. Put down in small pots well sealed. This pickle 
will remain good for years. It should stand two months before using. 

Sweet Apple Pickle.^Three pounds of sugar to seven of cored 
apples, and one pint of vinegar. Steam the apples till tender, but not 
too much ; stick a clove or two in every quarter. Make a syrup of the; 
sugar and vinegar and pour while hot over the apples. May be kept in 
a well-covered jar in a cool place, and keep well. 

String Beans.— Cut the ends off the tiny pods and remove the littte. 
beginnings of "strings," pack in glass jars, and pour in the boiling spiced 
and sweetened vinegar just as if making sweet pickled pears or peaches. . 
If white wine vinegar is used the beans will retain their vivid green 
color and thus make a pretty as well as a delicious relish. 

Beets, Canned. — Select small, dark- red beets, about the size of a 
peach or smaller, boil in the usual way, being careful not to break the 
skins in washing; do not cut the tops too close and be sure not to cut 
the ends off. Boil in salted water until tender, but not too soft Rub 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 1ST 

the skins off as lOon as they arc cool enough to handle, also cut ofF 
top and tail and pack in fruit jars; act aside and prepare your vinegar. 
It will not be necessary to lieat the beets over again. Put as much 
vinegar over the fire as will be required to cover the beets ; when this 
comes to a boil add a little sugar, ^iccording to taste. Let the vinegar 
boil five minutes longer; pour over ihe beets piping hot and seal. A 
small piece of horseradish put into each jar will keep the white scum, 
from forming on the top of the vinegar. 

Beet Relish.— Boi! two medium-iiied beets until tender, drain and 
let stand in cold water three minutes, then skin, slice thin and cover with 
strong vinegar for one hour. Drain .off the vinegar and mash the beets 
thoroughly, adding three tablespoons of grated horseradish, a pinch of 
s^lt and a dash of black pepper. 

Beet Sweet Pickle. — Boil till tender, then skin, and cut into slices or 
strips. Put in glass jars rather loosely, so that each piece will be sur- 
rcunded by the pickle. To two quarts of vinegar add four pounds of 
brown sugar, and, when these are in the kettle, add a scant half-ieaspoon- 
ful of pulverized alum. Use a p9 reel a in -lined kettle for this liquid, and 
bring the contents to a boil. Skim carefully, and then add to it a small 
cheesecloth bag containing a teaspoonful each of whole peppercorns, 
allspice and cloves. Boil again, and add a little cayenne pepper and salt. . 
Fill the jars to overflowing with this liquid, and set aside over night. The 
next morning drain the beets, and bring the syrup again to a hard boil. 
Pour this again into the jars of beets, doing so while it is scalding hot, 
and filling each jar to overflowing. Seal immediately. 

Blackberry Pickle. — Put a pint of the best cider vinegar in a granite 
kettle, together with four cupfuls of graiftilated sugar, one teaspoonful 
of ground cloves, and two teaspoonfuls of ground cinnamon; when it 
boils add three quarts of dewberries or blackberries that have been care- 
fully cleaned ; let the fruit cock 10 minutes in the syr^p, then skim the 
berries into a gallon jar; pour over the syrup and turn a plate over them 
to keep the berries belov* the surface; tie a double fold of cloth and 
thick paper over the jar when the fruit is cold and the pickle will 
keep perfectly. 

Cauliflower Pickles.— Two cauliflowers, broken up, one pint small 
onions, three medium-sized red peppers ; dissolve half a pint of salt in 
water sufficient to cover the vegetables, and let stand over night; drain 
in the morning; steam the vegetables until tender; heal two quarts of 
vinegar with three level tablespoonfuls of fnustard (less if preferred) 
until it boils; pour over vegetables; bottle and seal. 

Pickled Cherries. — Five pounds of cherries, stoned or not, as pre- 
ferred; one quart of vinegar, two pounds of sugar, one-half ounce of 
cinnamon, one-half ounce of cloves, same amount of mace, all ground. 



15B THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Boil the sugar, vinegar and spices (tie the latter in a bag) together, and 
pour hot over the cherries. 

Spiced Cherries. — Make a syrup by boiling together four pounds of 
granulaied sugar, one pint of vinegar, one-half ounce each of cinnamon 
bark and whole cloves. Cook in this till the skin breaks nine pounds 
of firm, ripe cherries. 

Chopped Pickle,— One-half peck green tomatoes, two stalks of celery, 
one green pepper, one-half a cabbage, three large onions, all chopped, to 
which add one-half a cupful of mustard seed, two tablespoonfuls of 
celery seed, one-half cupful of brown sugar, one-quarter cupful of salt, 
one teaspoonful of black pepper, the same of cinnamon, one saltspoonfut 
each of cloves and allspice and one quart of vinegar. Mix all weH tQ- 
gether and seal in Mason jars. Will keep perfectly. 

Chow Chow. — Wash thoroughly and chop without paring half a 
peck of green tomatoes; chop fine one large head of white cabbage; pare 
and chop six large cucumbers ; clean thoroughly and cut into small dice 
one bunch of celery and finely chop one large white onioiL Mix all 
together, add half a cup of salt and let stand over night Clean 100 
tiny pickles and fifty small silver-skinned onions ; put into separate jars, 
cover with strong salt water and let them stand over night The next 
morning drain the first mixture thoroughly, wash off the pickles and 
onions and wipe dry. Chop tine one large red mango pepper. Put ail 
together into a preserving kettle, add two quarts of the best cider 
vinegar (dilute somewhat if very strong), half a pound o( granulated 
sugar, half an ounce each of turmeric and celery seed, one ounce of 
ground mustard seed. Cook 30 minutes, then bottle and seal. 

English Chow Chow. — This calls for two medium-sized heads of 
firm white cabbage, half a peck of green tomatoes, two quarts of firm 
ripe tomatoes, half a dozen green peppers and two red peppers. Chop 
all together as fine as you can, and pack the mixture in layers of salt,- 
Put it in a coarse bag of burlap or some rough material. Lay it over a 
rack placed upon a deep keg or jar and put a heavy press upon it. Let it 
drain in this way over night, or for 24 hours. A pint and a half of 
sugar, half a cup of grated horseradish, half a teaspoonful of ground 
black pepper, half an even teaspoonful of ground mustard, an ounce of 
white mustard seed, an ounce of celery seed, a tablespoonful of ground 
mace and, finally, a gill of Dutch mustard compose the seasonings and 
must be added to the mixture. After it has drained sufficiently moisten 
the whole with enough good cider vinegar scantily to cover it. This 
chow chow requires no cooking and does not have to be put up in sealed 
jars. A stone crock is all sufficient, if kept in a cold, dry place. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. ■ isg 

Virginia Chow Chow. — This is an old recipe. One peck each of 
green and ripe tomatoes, one large, firm head of cabbage, six each of 
ETcen and ripe peppers, six large white onions and two bunches of 
celery. Chop the vegetables fine, sprinkle over them a cupful of coarse 
salt and let them soak 24 hours. Drain all the liquid oS, cover with 
best cider vinegar, stir in one pound of dark brown sugar, one-half 
cupful of grated horse-radish, two tablespoonfuJs of white mustard 
seed, one tablespoonful of ground ginger, one teaspoonful of ground 
cloves and the same amount of allspice. Let the pickle come slowly 
to the boiling point, then remove to the back of the range and let it 
stand for one hour. Seal up in Mason jars, and it will be ready for ' 
use in a week, but will improve with age. 

Com and Cabbage. — Cut the kernels from 13 large ears of com, add 
as much chopped cabbage as there is cut corn, one large sweet pepper 
freed from seeds and chopped, one cupful of brown sugar, two table- 
spoonfuls of salt, one-half tnblespoonful of ground mustard and one 
quart of vinegar. Bring all to a boil and then can. 

Corn Relish. — Chop one head of cabbage ; sprinkle over it two table- 
spoonfuls of salt and let stand over night Cut the kernels from 12 
ears of corn; chop three peppers. Mix all together. Mix with them a 
little celery seed; grated horseradish, or both if liked, though neither 
are needed to insure the keeping qualities of the relish! Bring two 
quarts of vinegar to boiling heat; add one cup of sugar and a quarter 
of a pound of mustard that has been rubbed smooth in a little cold 
vinegar. Pour this hot dressing over the mixture; stir until well 
mixed; put in glass jars, or small jars. 

Cora Salad. — Eighteen large ears com, one head cabbage, one-fourth 
pound ground mustard, four red peppers (chopped), one-half cup. salt, 
one and two-thirds cup sugar, two quarts vinegar. Com is shaved from 
cob, cabbage and peppers chopped and all ingredients thoroughly mixed. 
It is then cooked one hour. By cookii^ in oven it need not be stirred 
so frequently and there is much less danger of burning. It is canned 
and sealed while hot 

Pickled Crab Apple. — One quart of vinegar, three pounds brown 
sugar; make this into a syrup. Have the apples in a gallon jar or one 
of size that will set in an iron kettle. Pour this syrup over them, have 
seasoning tied in small pieces of cheese cloth and cook with the rest 
Boil in the jar until a fork will go easily into the apples. The juice 
need not cover the fruit at first, the apples help make more. This 
keeps the fruit whole and is very satisfactory; it needs a weight like a 
- small plate to keep apples under the liquor. 

Cucumbers in Barrels.— Choose small cucumbers free from spots. 
Put a layer of cucumbers in the bottom of a cask, then a layer of coarse 



160 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

salt, about one-fourth inch thick, then another layer of cucumbere, more 
salt, and so on until all are \xfed. Place a board on top of the pickles, 
with a heavy stone to keep them down. Then pour in about a quart of 
water to moisten the salt, which, with the juice exuding from the cu- 
cumbers should make sufficient brine to cover. Continue to add cu- 
cumbers, as they are gathered, in layers as before; a few cabbage or 
horseradish leaves on top, under the board, will prevent molding. When 
the cask is full, tuck .a cloth closely around the edges, put board and 
weight on top, and cover closely, and the cucumbers will keep for a 
year or two. When cucumbers are wanted for pickling, remove cloth, 
board and stone, and wash them well in warm water ; wipe all scum 
from sides of cask with a clean cloth, take out cucumbers, and then 
cover any remaining as before. Soak cucumbers for three days in cold 
water, changing water each day ; drain and wipe carefully. Half fill a 
large porcelain- lined preserving kettle with good cider vinegar, [mt in 
as many cucumbers as the vinegar will cover, with a piece of aluii the 
size of a hazelnut ; heat to boiling point, stirring with a wooden spoon 
so that they do not soften at bottom of kettle, and then drain, throw- 
ing away the vinegar. Cover with fresh cold vinegar, spice if desired. 
A little chopped horseradish at top will prevent molding. They will 
be ready for use in about a week. A great many cucumber pickles are 
sold direct irom the brine. 

Brine for Cucumbers. — To six parts of water use one part salt, and 
one part of cider vinegar. Kf«p the pickles well under the brine, and 
they will keep longer and be more brittle than when laid down in salt, 
, in the old way. 

Pickle for Cucumbers.— One-half ounce of black pepper, one and 
one-half ounce of ginger, one ounce of allspice, one ounce of cloves, 
one ounce of mustard seed, three-fourths of a pound of salt, half a>tea- 
spoon cayenne pepper, one ounce ground mustard, one ounce turmeric, 
and six quarts of vinegar. The spices are to be scalded in the vinegar, 
except the mustard and turmeric which should be added when ■ the 
vinegar is cold. For a good pickle without mustard: Put a teacupful 
of salt and a tablespoonful of powdered alum into a gallon of vinegar. 
Pick small cucumbers and pour a weak brine over them, boiling hot. 
Let stand over night ; drain, and put into prepared vinegar. Add ■ cu- 
cumbers as convenient, and when as many have been put into the vinegar 
as it will cover scald them up, and put into fresh vinegar, to which has 
been added a little red peppsr and horseradish. 

Canned Cucumbers. — Cucumbers canned as follows will keep until 
the following June, and are excellent to serve with meat or salad:' 
Peel and slice thin medium-sized cucumbers, sprinkle with salt and a 
little alum; let stand two hours; drain and put in jars, adding vinegar 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. l«l 

enough to cover, pepper and a few whole mustard seeds, the quantity ol 
pepper to be governed by the taste, and the whole pepper to be used 
'in preference to the ground. On top of the jar, when ready for seal- 
ing, add a dessertspoonful of olive oil. 

Chopped Cucumber Relish, — This is simple and very excellent. Pare 
and chop line half a peck of medium-sized cucumbers ; chop two medium- 
sized onions. Salt eadi separately over night, using one-third of a cup 
of salt in all. Drain thoroughly the next morning and mix. If the 
mixture seems too salty cover with cold water and drain a second time. 
Then put into a granite kettle, add a rounding tablespoonful each of 
celery seed and mustard seed, a level tablespoonful of ground mustard, 
one-eighth of a teaspoon of cayenne pepper, half a cup of brown 
sugar and a pint of best vinegar. Boil 10 minutes, then bottle and seal 

Dill Pickles, — Make a brine strong enough to bear an egg, then add 
half as much more water as you have brine. Wash cucumbers in cold 
water, and into a stone jar put first a layer of cucumbers, then a layer 
of grape leaves and a layer of dill, using leaves and stems. Continue 
in this way until the jar is full. Pour the brine over all and cover, first 
with a cloth, then with a plate, and put a weight on top of the plate. 
The cloth must be washed frequently as in making sauerkraut. 

Gherkins. — Wipe one quart of small unripe cucumbers. Put in a 
stone crock and add one-quarter cupful of salt dissolved in one pint 
of boiling water. Let stand three days. Drain cucumbers from brine, 
bring the brine to the boiling point,- pour over the cucumbers, and again 
let stand three days. Repeat ; drain, wipe cucumbers, and pour over 
one quart of boiling water in which one scant tcaspoonful of alum has 
been dissolved. Let stand six hours, then drain from alum water. 
Cook cucumbers 10 minutes, a few at a time, in one-fourth of the fol- 
lowing mixture, heated to the boiling point and boiled 10 minutes : One 
quart of vinegar, one red pepper, one-half stick of cinnamon, oue-half 
leaspoonful allspice, one-half tablespoonful of cloves. Strain the re- 
maining liquor over the pickles, which have been put in a stone jar. 
Bring liquor to boiling point before turning it over the pickles. 

Grated Cucumber Pickles. — Take cucumbers fully grown, pare them, 
and if the seeds are large remove them, then grate and drain through 
a colander, and to the pulp left add as much vinegar as there is juice, 

Cucumber Mustard Pickles. — To every gallon of water add two pints 
of fine salt, heat scalding hot and pour over the cucumbers. Let stand 
21 hours, pour off the brine. Heat sufficient vinegar to cover them. 
To every gallon of vinegar add one tablespoonful pulverized alum, pour 
over the cucumbers and cover tight to steam. Put on fresh cabbage 



t« THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

\'.ivti every other day for a week; heat the vinegar again, put back on 
I ucumbers and let stand two or three days. Then take fresh vinegar; 
10 every gallon put one teaspoonful of red pepper, one of black pepper, 
one ounce cinnamon sticks, two ounces white mustard seed, one small 
piece gilder root, a small handful of horseradish root, one teaspoonful 
of cloves. Boil the spices in a bag, then pour over pickles. These will 
keep crisp and nice indefinitely if kept under the vinegar, or may be 
bottled and sealed if preferred. 

Oiled Cucumber Pickles. — Pare and slice the cucumbers as for serving. 
For 50 medium-sized ones (these are best, because the seeds are not 
large) make a dressing of one cupful of olive oil, half a cupful of white 
mustard seed, half a cupful of black mustard seed, one tablespoonful 
of celery seed and one quart of vinegar. No cooking is required. Sprin- 
kle the sliced cucumbers with salt, and let them stand over night In 
the morning drain them thoroughly and cover with the dressing in x 
stone jar. A pint of onions sliced thin may be added. It so, the onions 
should be arranged in alternate layers with the sliced cucumbers and 
salt Place a weight over the top, let the mixture stand over night, 
and drain as before. 

Quick Pickles. — Gather small cucumbers, wash, and rub off the 
prickles. Pack in a two-quart glass jar, put a tablespoonful of salt on 
top, shaking it down, fill with cold water, put the cover on, and set 
away 24 hours. Then pour off the brine, rinse the cucumbers, and fill 
the jar with cold vinegar. Screw the top on tight, and store in cellar. 
If the vinegar looks white in a few months' time pour a little off the 
top, and fill up with fresh. These pickles are very good, though ex- 
tremely sour. 

Quick Mustard Pickles. — Put a gallon of vinegar and one cupful, 
each, of salt and mustard into a two gallon crock; pick small, quickly 
grown cucumbers; rub off the black specks, and put into vinegar. In 
a few days the pickles are ready for use. Some people add a cup of 
sugar and one of grated horseradish to the above recipe, but it is a 
matter of taste, as neither is necessary to the keeping quality of the 
pickles. Each time cucumbers are added to those in the crock all should 
be well stirred up from the bottom. It is a good plan to put a quart 
of vinegar with its proper proportion of salt and mustard into a two- 
quart glass can, and fill in cucumbers for immediate use. 

Ripe Cucumber Pickles. — Peel and cut ripe cucumbers in rings, 
sprinkle salt on them and let remain over night. Drain off, and cover 
with hot spiced vinegar. 

Salting Cucumbers for Winter. — Secure a small keg and if you have 
cucumbers in your garden gather every other day. Place a layer of 
coarse salt-Mce cream salt— in the bottom of the keg, add a cup of water 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 163 

and cover with the cucumbers you have gathered and washed; sprinkle 
over salt to cover. Repeat this as you gather cucumbers from day to 
day, not, however, adding any more water, as the salt should make suf- 
ficient brine. If there should not be brine to cover them you may add 
a little, cautiously. There should always be a layer of salt in the bot- 
tom of the keg undissolved. When you have gathered all the cucumbers 
you wish put two or three fresh horseradish leaves on the top, and if 
you wish you may place a stone on the top to keep the encumbers under 
the brine. When desired to_ make pickles take from the brine as many 
as you wish into a stone jar and cover them with boiling water; let 
them stand 34 hours; drain and cover again with boiling water; let 
stand till next day. If you desire them very fresh you may repeat this 
the third time. It is not always necessary. Then pour off the water 
and drain well. To every three quarts of cucumbers take one quart of 
best cider vinegar. To each gallon of vinegar take one teaspoonful 
each of whole cloves, allspice, peppercorns, mace, celery seed and two 
teaspoonfuls of mustard seed. Tie these in a little muslin or cheese- 
cloth bag. (The spices, if scattered through the cucumbers, turn them 
dark.) Add to vinegar two pieces of ginger-root an inch long and 
two tiny red pepper pods, same size. Boil vinegar with spices for one 
minute 'and pour over the cucumbers. If not enough vinegar to cover, 
add more boiling hot to fill jar. These need not be sealed. Place a 
horseradish leaf on the top of jar; are ready for use in a few days. 
Will keep indefinitely. 

Small cucumber pickles are prepared as follows: Wash and wipe; 
place in jars, an<l cover with boiling brine, strong enough to bear an egg. 
Let stand S4 houi's; pour off the brine, wipe, and place in clean jars. 
Cover with hot vinegar, spiced in the proportion of one onion, 12 whole 
cloves, one ounce of mustard seed and three blades of mace to 100 cu- 
cumbers. They will be. ready to use in two weeks. 

Sour Cucumber Pickles. — Dissolve one pint of salt in one gallon of 
vinegar; wash the cucumbers and pour over them some boiling water, 
let stand five or ten minutes, then pack closely in cans, pour over the 
salted vinegar and seal. The friend who sends this recipe says the 
pickles are very crisp smd nice, and will keep as long as you will let 

Spiced Cucumber Pickles. — Prepar vinegar for pickles as follows: 
One gallon vinegar, four ounces salt, two ounces cloves, two ounces 
cinnamon, one ounce allspice, one ounce ginger root, one ounce yellow 
mustard seed, one ounce celery seed, small piece of alum. Scald all 
together. This will keep for years. Wash the cucumbers and drain 
until dry, then put them into the vinegar at any time after it is cold. 



]M THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

If tt)e vinegar is very sharp add a little water to it before scaJding the 
ingredients together, or the pickles will shrivel. 

Sweet Cucumber Pickles. — Let the cucumbers stand in salt water 
three days. Heat the brine once or twice and pour over them. Drain ; 
put in a jar and pour over them hot vinegar with cloves and cinnamon 
in a bag; two-thirds <!upful sugar to quart of vinegar; put in plenty 
of horseradish and this will keep sealed or open. Put in a little alum 
to make them brittle. 

Boiled Sweet Cucumber Pickle. — Put cucumbers in cold weak brine 
(IJ^ cup salt to one gallon water) one day and night. Take out, dry 
on cloth. To one gallon vinegar add two cups sugar, nearly one ounce 
mixed, spice. Heat these all boiling hot. Put in pickles and let boil 
up once. Put in cans immediately and pour the hot vinegar over them. 
They are nice and sweet, and will keep a long time, till ealen. These 
will not shrivel if you follow directions. One gallon vinegar will cover 
two gallons cucumbers. 

Steamed Sweet Cucumber Pickle. — Peel, steam as soft as liked and 
let stand over night in a weak brine. Next morning drain, put on 
vinegar enough to cover, and let sland over night Again in the morn- 
ing drain off the liquid part. Now take one pint of fresh vinegar, three 
pounds of sugar and one c-uce of cassia buds (no other spices). When 
this comes to the boiling point put in the cucumbers, let scald up and then 
. pack away in stone jars. 

Tested Cucumber Pickles. — Wash and fill two-quart can with freshly 
picked cucumbers of any desiied size. Add to them two heaping table- 
spoonfuls dry mustard; two heaping tablespoonfuls salt, and fill can 
with good cold cider vinegar. It doesn't mailer whether you have an 
airtight top or not; a cork with cloth tied over, or put in crock. If 
you like more mustard or salt it will do no barm. 

Pickles Without Cooking. — One cupful of sugar, one cupful salt, one 
goodsized root of horseradish, one tablespoonful alum, one tablespoonful 
white mustard seed, one gallon vinegar, mixed spice to taste. Boil the 
above ingredients. Then allow the prepared vinegar to become cold 
befort putting in the cucumbers. Use the smallest pickles, as the large 
ones do not always become thoroughly pickled, but for the small ones 
this way of preparing them is excellent. 

Spiced Currants.— Make a syrup of three pounds of sugar, one pint 
. of vinegar and water, half rnd half, two tablespoonfuls of cinnamon, 
one tablespoonful of cloves, half a teaspoonful of salt; add six pounds 
of washed, stemmed currants and boil half an hour. Seal in jars. 

Pickled Damsons, — This is a sweet pickle, and very good served 
with mutton or venison. Ing[redients required: Three pounds danuons, 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. . MS 

one quart of vinegar, three pounds moist sugar, one-half ounce cinna- 
mon, three blades of mace, one-quarter ounce allspice. The plums 
should be ripe, but not too much SO; the bloom is rubbed off with a 
piece of flannel or a clean cloth, and they are pricked a little with a 
npedle. The vinegar, sugar and spices are boiled together for 10 min- 
utes, then strained and poured over the fruil, in a large basin Next 
day the vinegar is boiled again, and again poured over the damsons, 
and on the third day the damsons themselves are simmered in (he 
vinegar for exactljf live minutes. They should be tied down while hot. 
A quicker method of pickling either plums or damsons is the following; 
Remove the stalks from the fruit ; wipe it and arrange in layers in a 
jar with good brown sugar sprinkled between. Fill up the jars with 
cold vinegar,, tie them down and bake in rather a slow oven till the 
plums are tender, then tie down for use. 

French ATustard. — Take six ounces of salt, four ounces of scraped 
horseradish, one clove of garlic, and two quarts of boiling vinegar; 
Sleep these together in a covered vessel for six hours, then strain and 
add mustard to the spiced vinegar sufficient to make it the proper con- 
sistency. These proportions are large ; they can be reduced if necessary, 
but the mustard will keep a long time, as it is made with boiling vinegar, 

Gillespie Relish.^Ore peck ripe tomatoes, two cupfuls celery, six 
large onions, seven red peppers. Run the peeled tomatoes and the 
onions through a meal grinder. Chop the celery and the peppers fine. 
Add two ounces of mustard seed and ground cinnamon, one-halt cupful 
of salt, three pints cider vinegar and two pounds of light brown sugar. 
Mix and seal. Do not cook. It is claimed that this will keep per- 
fectly for five years, and it is very appetiiing and universally liked. 

Hebrew Pickle. — For a pint of pickles grate two roots of horse- 
radish. Mix with it two tables poo ntuls of celery seed, three tablespoon- 
fuls of mustard seed, four tabic spoonfuls of sugar and one tablespoonful 
of turmeric. Cover the ingredients with scalding hot vinegar. Sea! in 
glass jars. Let stand one week before using. 

India Relish.— This recipe calls for gherkins, large cucumbers, small 
onions, cabbage and red peppers. Green nasturtium seeds may be added. 
Cut the vegetables all into small pieces and put the mixture, layer by 
layer, into a stone jar, separating the layers with salt. Sprinkle the top 
well with salt, cover with a plate weighted with a flaliron, stone or 
brick, and let the jar and contents stand for three days. At the end of 
that titne drain off the liquid and rinse the vegetables thoroughly in 
cold WEtter. Then cover with fresh cold water and leave for 36 hours. 
In the niAntime scald three-quarters of a gallon of cider vinegar with 
half a tablespoonful each of celery seed, paprika, cloves, mace, ground 
mustarc^ and horseradish and two tablespoonfuls of curry. Add one 



]«S THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

and three-quarters cupful of brown sugar. Turn the vinegar over the 
drained vegetables and cook for a quarter of an hour. Put the relish 
into a stone jar and leave it for two or three days. Then drain off the 
vinegar, scald it and pour it while hot over the vegetables. Let it 
nand until the next day, then fill into small jars, cover closely and 
keep in a cool dark place. 

India Relish No. a,— This comes from the South. Two pounds of 
citron melon or watermelon rind, two heads of cabbage, white and firm; 
six white onions, one large cupful of sugar, one heaping teaspoonful 
each of ground cinnamon, mace, paprika (Hungarian sweet pepper), 
mustard and powdered alum, one tablespoonful of curry powder, one 
quart of vinegar, two tablespoonful s of celery seed, one tablespoonful 
of salt. Prepare the melon by cutting off the green rind and scraping 
away the softer inner coating, leaving less than an inch firm and white. 
Cut into thin strips, put into a porcelain-lined kettle, cover with cold 
water and sprinkle a tablespoonful of powdered alum over it Cover 
closely and cook gently for three hours. I>rain well and cover with 
ice water. Change the water twice in four hours, and then wipe the 
melon dry. Cut the cabbage into quarters, cook in boiling water slightly 
salted for fifteen minutes. Let it get perfectly cold. Parboil the 
onions, and allow them also to get cold and stiff. Now chop cabbage, 
melons and onions separately and very fine. Mix all together in a large 
crock and pour over them the scalding hot vinegar, in which have been 
boiled for one minute the spices, sugar and celery seed. Leave the 
crock covered 24 hours. Strain off the vinegar, bring it to a boil and 
pour again over the mixture in the crock Repeat this for three days 
in succession, after which pack in small jars, cover closely and set away 
to ripen. It will be ready for use in six weeks, but improves by keeping. 

Pickled Mangoes. — Voung musk, or nutmeg melons are needed for 
the purpose. Through a slit in the side of the melon extract all the 
seeds with the fingers without breaking the fruit. In case the patience 
gives out, a plug can be cut out, saved and replaced, but it is better to 
make only the slit Keep the melons in strong brine for three days, 
then drain them and let them remain in pure water for 24 hours. Heat 
slowly in vinegar, in which alum has been dissolved, until the melons are 
green. For a gallon of vinegar a piece of alum half the size of a 
hickorynut will be wanted. The following is the recipe for the stuf- 
fing, given in an old cook book: One handful of horseradish scraped; 
two handfuls of English mustard seed, two teaspoonfuls of chopped 
garlic, one teaspoonful of ground nutmeg and mace, one dozen whole 
peppercorns, one teaspoonful of ground ginger, half a tablespoonful of 
ground mustard, one teaspoonful of sugar, one teaspoonful of celery 
Mcd and one tablespoonful of olive oiL Fill the greened qiangoei 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 167 

through the slit with the mixture. Sew up the slit, or tie the melon 
securely so that it will not open. Pack the mai^oes in a big stone jar 
and pour scalding vinegar over them. After two days, drain oflf the 
vinegar, scald and return it to the jar, and repeat twice at interval! 
ef two days. The mangoes will be ready for use in four or five 
months. 

Minced Pickle. — Chop half a peck of green tomatoes, cover them with 
two-thirds of a cupful of salt and let them stand for a day and a 
night Then scald half a gallon of vinegar with a lablespoonful of 
pepper, a lablespoonful and a hall each of ground mustard, allspice, 
cinnamon and cloves and half a cupful of white mustard seed. Add to 
the tomatoes two onions chopped fine and four large green peppers de- 
nuded of seeds and cut into rings. Turn the vinegar over the mixture 
and boil steadily 20 minutes; then, bottle. 

Mixed Pickle. — Three hundied small cucumbers, two heads of cauli- 
flower, one of cabbage, six green peppers with seeds taken out, three 
quarts small onions and two quarts small beans. Cut the cabbage and 
the cauliflower in small pieces, and put all in a brine strong enough to 
bear up an egg. Let them remain 24 hour^, then rinse and drain thor- 
oughly. Place on the stove two gallons of vinegar, add a large root 
of horseradish, grated, two ounces each of mustard seed and black pep- 
per, one teaspoon cayenne, and one ounce of turmeric Let it boil and 
pour over pickles in a jar. When cold mix in one cupful of mustard 
wet with cold vinegar.

celery roots, four tablespoonfuls grated horseradish, six large green 
tomatoes, one large or two small Spanish onions, 1^ quart of vinegar, 
one-fourth teaspoonful of powdered aluin. Chop all the vegetables and 
mix them together. Put a layer about two inches thick in the bottom 
of a jar, sprinkle it with a table spoonful of salt, then another layer of 
vegetables and salt, and so on until all is used. Allow it to stand 24 
hours, then drain, and press out all the liquor ; cover with boiling 
water, allow it to stand 10 minutes, then press with the hands until 
entirely dry. Add to one quart of vinegar 34 teaspoonful of alum, and 
stir until dissolved. Put a layer of the pickles two inches thick in the 
bottom of a jar, sprinkle with mustard seed, black pepper, and the 
grated horseradish ; then another layer of pickle, and so on until used. 
Pour the vinegar over, let it stand two days, and it is ready for use. 

Mock Olives. — Two quarts of green plums, IJ^ lablespoonful mus- 
tard seed, ZYi tablespoonfuls salt, two quarts vinegar. Place the plums 
in a stone jar with mustard seed and salt; turn the vinegar into a pre- 
serving kettle, bring to a boil and pour over plums. Cover closely. 



1« THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Next day drain oS the vinegar, bring again to a boil and pour over 
plums while hot. H plums arc large repeat the third morning. When 
cold place all in olive bottles and cork lightly. They will taste like 
rea) olives. 

Muskmelon Pickles. — Pare Ihe rind off ripe, spicy, green' melons, re- 
move the seeds and cut into thick slices. Weigh as for peaches, seveti 
pounds o| fruit to three and one-quarter pounds of sugar, and put the 
£Ugar to cook with water enough to dissolve it. Boil and skim it until 
clear, then pour it over Ihe melon in a crock. Repeat this for three 
mornings, but on the third morning add a cupful of vinegar to each 
three pints of syrup and boil it up with a cupful of spices in a bag. 
Pour it over the melon in jars and seal at once. 

Mustard Pickles. — Two quarts small cucumbers, one quart small

of flour, two quarts best cider vinegar. Mix dry ingredients thor- 
oughly, add vinegar, boil a few minutes, pour over pickles and bottle. 

Mustard Pickles No. 2, — This differs from most recipes for this 
pickle in being made without green tomato. Put one-half peck small 
encumbers, two quarts silver skinned onions, and two heads of picked 
ouliflower to soak in water to cover and a cupful of salt over night. In 
the morning drain ; mix one dessertspoonful of turmeric powder with

celery seed, one-half ounce white mustard seed, one teaspoonful each 
of cinnamon and cloves, one pound of brown sugar, carefully stir in 
the mustard and turmeric paste and let boil up well ; then add the 
mixed pickles, two red peppers chopped with the seeds of same, and 
stir all together. After it begins to bubble let boil well for five minutes. 

Mustard Pickles No. 3,— Equal quantities of cucumbers, celery, cauli- 
flower and small button onions. Cut all in small pieces except the 
onions. Cover with strongly-salted water for 34 hours ; drain, put into 
a jar, and pour on hot vinegar (not too strong) sufficient to cover. Let 
the pickles stand three day;, and then drain. To five quarts of the 
pickle use three quarts of cider vinegar, one cupful of sugar, and two 
tablespoon fuls of butter. Heat to boiling, then stirring constantly (for 
fear of burning) add cnt cupful i>f flour, six tablespoonfuls of ground

THE RURAL COOK BOOK. IfiH 

Sliced Mustard Pickles. — One dozen large cucumbers sliced, two 
dozen very small cucumbers, one quart of small onions, one large cauli- 
flower, steamed slightly. So.ik all these ingredients in cold brine over 
night. Paste for the pickles is made as follows: One-half pound of 
ground yellow mustard, one teacupful of flour, one leacupful of sugar, 
one-half ounce of turmeric. Rub the above ingredients together with a 
little vinegar until smooth. Then add three quarts of vinegar, letting 
it scald until a thick paste. Next add one-half ounce of celery seed, 
and pout the hot paste over the pickles, put in cans and seal. 

Nasturtium Pods Pickled, — Put the pods to soak in weak brine 
for two days, then in fresh water one day; drain, put in a jar, and 
cover with boiling vinegar. The vinegar may be spiced if desired, but 
if the pods are to be used in sauce they are better unspiced. 

Pickled Onions, — First pour boiling water over the onions to loosen 
the skins. As soon as cool enough to handle begin to peel, dropping 
the onions as peeled into salt water (not brine) to prevent their being 
discolored. Make a strong brine, heat to the boiling point, and pour 
over the onions. Leave them in the brine 48 hours, then drain. Spice 
vinegar 'according to taste, litat lo boiling point, 'and pnur over the 
onions. Set away for two or three days, drain off the vinegar, heat it 
again, and pour it over the onions in the jars in which they are to be 
stored; tie up the jars and set away. 

Pickled Peaches. — For pick'.ing select medium-sized peaches, ripe and 
firm. Rub off the down with a piece of iiannel. To eight pounds of 
fruit use four pounds of granulated sugar, one quart of vinegar, two 
ounces of stick cinnamon, Boii the sugar, vinegar and cinnamon for five 
minutes. Then put in the peaches carefully, a few at a time. If one 
likes cloves, two or three may be stuck in each peach. When the 
peaches arc done enough to be easily pricked with a fork, take them out 
and put in the jar. When the peaches are all cooked boii the syrup 
till a little thick, pour over peaches and seal cans or jars. 

Sweet Pickled Peaches.— Cut the peaches in two, remove the stones, 
and close the openings with halves together, pack in jars, and cover with 
the following liquid: To two pounds of sugar add one pint of vinegar 
(best cider vinegar alone should be used for all pickles), tie in a bag 
a teaspoonful of whole cloves, one-half teaspoonful cassia buds, three 
sticks of cinnamon (broken) and some tiny bits of ginger, allspice and 
nutmeg (about a teaspoonful in all). Scald three times and seal the 
jars. Keep in dark, dry place; when ready to use remove the spice. 

Sweet Pickled Pears.— Select ripe but firm fruit, peel and measure 
out for every seven pounds of fruit four of white sugar, one pint of soft 
Vinegar aad half a tablespoonful each of whole doves, whole allspice

and ctntuunon sticks. Put tbe pcari in a kettle and over each layer 
sprinkle sugar until both are exhausted Heat slowly nntil the boiling 
point is reached, then add the vrnegair and spice and boil five minutes. 
Take out the fruit with a perforated skimmer and sprea.d upon platters 
to cool. Boil the syrup till thick. Heat the jars, pack in the pears 
and pour the syrup over boiling hot; seal. 

Pepper Hash. — Wash and dry five large green peppers and one red 
one, remove seeds and chop shells quite fine; chop fine a good-sized 
cabbage, and place with the peppers in a bowl, mixing well. Add two 
tablespoon fills of brown mustard seed; three tablespoonfuls of salt and 
enough good cider vinegar to cover the whole. Stir well together and 
put into pickle bottles. Ready for use in two days, or will keep for 
Winter use. 

Pepper Mangoes, — Two dozen full-grown pods of red pepper. Cut 
out the stems with a sharp knife and scrape out the seeds. Lay the pods 
in brine and let soak for 24 hours. Drain, Make a. dressing of finely 
chopped cabbage, enough to fill the peppers, seasoned with one table- 
spoonful each of salt and pulverized mustard seed, one, teaspoonful of 
grated horseradish, qne teaspoonful of black pepper and one tablespoon- 
ful of made mustard. When well mixed stuff the peppers, sew tbe 
stems on with a coarse thread, pack in a stone jar, cover with strong 
vinegar and let stand two weeks before using. 

Pickled Peppers. — Put two dozen green peppers in a bowl and pour 
over them a very strong brine. Put a weight over them to keep them 
under the water and let them lie for two days. Drain them, make a 
small incision in the side of each to let out the water, wipe them with 
« soft cloth and put them in a stone jar, with one-half ounce of whole 
allspice, one-half ounce of whole doves and a small lump of alum. Pour 
cold vinegar over them and tie a bladder securely over the jar. Pickled 
in this way the peppers should preserve their color. 

Pepper Relish, — Remove the seeds from six large green peppers and 
one red bell pepper, and chop the peppers fine. Mix the peppers with 
a finely minced head of cabbage. Turn in a little less than a quarter 
of a cupful of salt, a full cupful of sugar, two tablespoonfuls of mus- 
tard seed and nice cider vinegar enough to cover the mixture. Stir 
thoroughly and bottle. 

Piccalilli. — Two pecks of green tomatoes, two heads of white cab- 
bage, 13 large onions, four green peppers, two red peppers, one good 
root of horseradish (grated), one tablespoonful each of cinnamon, nut- 
meg and allspice. Chop all fine, stir in two cups of salt and let stand 
all night, then drain; cover with cold vinegar, boil 10 minutes and drain 
again. Cover with vinegar, add the spices and three pounds of brown 
sugar. Boil a few minutes and put away in jars. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 171 

Canned Pimentos. — These are simply red peppers, the long, tapering, 
sharp-pointed sweet variety. They repay one for the trouble, as they 
retail at 15 cents a can, and in glass jars at 35 cents per quart. Selcrt 
ripe red ones, neither dry nor woody. Cut off stem. end and extract the 
seeds. Drop in a jar and cover with brine that will float an egg. Let 
stand three days. Wash in several waters, cover with clear water one 
day, then drain well. Place peppers iti cans, fill to overflowing with 
boihng water, add a level tablcspoonful of salt to each quart of water; 
place in a boiler on two-inch layer of straw, weight cans to prevent 
tipping, pour in boiling water to cover two-thirds of the can, screw 
lids on loosely and cover the boiler. When the water boils simmer 10 
minutes, remove and seal. They are used in salads, as a relish with 
cold meats or are stuffed with rice, macaroni or bread crumbs. 

Pumpkin Pickle. — This is very good when there is a scarcity of 
apples. Pare the pumpkins carefully, leaving out all soft or stringy 
parts, then cut into pieces about ore or two inches square. Soak over 
night in vinegar, salt and water, just enough vinegar and salt to make 
a good flavor. The next day make a pickle as you would for any nice 
pickle and let them simmer on the back of the stove for a long time; 
without stirring. Our rule for pickle is seven pounds fruit, four pounds 
sugar and one pint of vinegar. We usually flavor the pumpkin pickle 
with either sliced lemon or ginger root. 

Quince Sweet Pickles.— Scrub with a small vegetable brush to re- 
move the down, wipe dry and cut out any spots or decayed portions. 
Slice, without paring, into rounds a fourth of an inch thick, leaving in 
both core and seeds, unless imperfect, then weigh. Put the fruit, a 
thin layer at a time, in a steamer or colander over boiling water, cover 
closely and steam until it is perfectly tender, then place in a stone 
jar. Make the syrup of four pounds of sugar, a pint of vinegar of 
medium strength, a pint of the water over which the fruit was steamed. 
an ounce of stick cinnamon, a heaping tablespoonfu! of allspice berries 
and a level tablcspoonful of whole cloves to seven pounds of the fruit. 
Pour over the fruit, cover securely and stand in a cool place over 
night. The next morning drain off the syrup, boil for 10 minutes with 
the spice bag, skim and pour again boiling hot over the fruit. Continue 
this process for three successive mornings. The last morning add the 
fruit to tlie syrup and spices and boil gently until heated through, then 
skim out and put into the crock. Continue to boil the syrup until it is 
as thick as molasses. If, after the second boiling, it does not seem 
spiced sufficiently, add more spices tied in a fresh bag. When the syrup 
is done, reheat the quinces in it, then fill into self-sealing glass jars as 
in cannii^. 

Red Cabbage Pickle.— Cut a red cabbage of good size into six pieces. 



m THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

sprinkle it with salt and leave it for a day and a night. Then drain off 
the liquid, rinse it with cold water and let it soak in tresh cold water. 
Scald half a gallon of vinegar with a dozen whole cloves and white pep- 
pers and a few blades of mace broken fine. Turn in half a cupful of 
sugar and Iwo or tKree tablespoonfols of celery seed. Cook slowly for 
a quarter of an hour. Have the cabbage, drained and dried, packed into' 
a stone, jar. Turn the hot vinegar over it and put il in a cool place. 
The cabbage will be at its best in two months. 

Spanish Sauce. — One peck green tomatoes, one quart onions, six 
large sweet peppers, four quarts ripe tomatoes, two heads celery chopped 
fine, two pounds brown sugar, one gallon vinegar, one teaspoonful 
cayenne pepper, three table.spoonfuls cinnamon, one tablespoonful each 
of allspice, mace and cloves. Chop green tomatoes, onions and seeded 
peppers, salt and let stand over night. In the morning strain through 
a cloth until perfectly dry. Then mix all the ingredients and boil until 
tender. ■ . 



Tomato Conserve. — Cut five large sound tomatoes into pieces and 
cook them until they are tender, with two onions in which three or 
four cloves have been stuck, Iwo bay leaves and salt and pepper to 
taste. Then turn the fruit on to a fine sieve placed over a bowl and 
drain off the juice. Boil the juice until it has been half reduced. Next 
remove the onions and bay leaves from the tomatoes left on the sieve 
and press the pulp through Ihe fine meshes. Add to it the juice, put 
the mixture into wide mouthed bottles ; cover them loosely and stand 
them in a kettle of warm water (it should be about their own tem- 
perature). Bring the water to a boil and boil for half an hour. LeaVe 
the bottles in the kettle until they are cool, then tighten their covers 
and set them in the dark. 

Egg Tomatoes in Sweet Pickle .^Pour scalding water over seven 
pounds of the egg tomatoes, let them stand for a moment, then remove 
the skin. Cover them with vinegar much diluted with water and let 
them stand 13 hours. Put one-half cupful of weak vinegar in the pre- 
serving kettle and add part of the tomatoes, then some sugar and any 
whole spices, such as ginger, allspice, cinnamon, cloves and mace, using 
these or even more varieties according to taste. Add more of the to- 
matoes, more sugar and more spices, alternating the layers thus until 
alt the tomatoes and five pounds of sugar have been used. Cook very 
gently, stirring just enough to prevent scorching without breaking the 
tomatoes. When these are quite clear and transparent, remove them 
carefully and boil down the syrup. When the syrup i» thick strain it 
and add the tomatoet. Boil up once and pour into pint jari to b« tealed

French Sweet Pickle. — One peck green tomatoes chopped and aix 
large onions sliced. Salt them and let stand over night. Then drain oS 
the watery part and cover with vinegar, add two teaspoons of baking 
soda dissolved in a little water, and let the whole boil for 15 minutes. 
Take two pounds of brown sugar, two ounces of cinnamon, one ounce 
of ground cloves and one-half pound of white mustard seed and mix 
dry. Put this in the kettle with three quarts of vinegar. Once more 
drain the tomato of its liquid part, add it to the spice and vinegar an<t 
cook for an hour. 

Green Tomato Chili Sauce. — Slice the green tomatoes and salt down 
as you do egg plant, put a weight on them and let stand until morn- 
ing, then rinse in cold water to take out the salt and wash out the seeds 
and bitter juice of the green tomato. For 12 tomatoes take four sweet 
green peppers, half dozen chili peppers, one large onion, one cupful 
vinegar, one tablespoonful sugar, two teaspoonfuls of salt, one of pep- 
per, two of ground allspice, half teaspoonful of mace, one of cinnamon,

porcelain-lined kettle with one pint of sugar and a few pieces of horse- 
radish root. Boil for five minutes, add the tomatoes and boil five 
minutes longer, put into stone jars, cover and set in cool, dry place. 
Whole cloves, mace and slick cinnamon may be added to this if you want 
a spiced pickle. 

Easy Green Tomato Pickle.— Slice the tomatoes and allow ihim to 
stand in weak salt brine over night. In the morning rinse and pack 
directly in fruit jars. Place tKe jars uncovered in the steamer and steam 
for about two hours. Have ready at the end of that time a sweet-spiced 
vinegar made exactly as you do for pickling peaches, and after draining ■ 
. all the juice that cooks from the sliced tomatoes, fill the cans brim-full 
with it and seal as in canning anything.

The nasturtium seeds should be not more than half grown, green, and 
if in clusters, so much the better. Skim out the tomato into a stone 
jar, add a liberal quantity of vinegar to the juice left in the kettle, and 
when it boils up pour over the contents of the jar.

seeds, pepper and sugar. Fill the tomato shells as full as possible and 
tie the tops firmly on with strong cord. Let the mangoes lie over night 
in very strong brine, then soak them for 34 hours in weak vinegar. 
Pack in a stone jar, leaving plenty of space above them, and fill the jar 
with three parts vinegar to one part water, sweetened to the taste. 
These mangoes may be made either sweet or sour as preferred. A few 
pieces of horseradish root will season and preserve the vinegar. 

Tomato soy is made with both green and ripe fruit. The following

sugar, two ounces each of black pepper, brown ginger, celery seed, mus- 
tard seed, mace, cloves, horseradish and allspice, one-half box of ground 
mustard, a little red pepper and one-half dozen pepper pods. Peel three 
dozen onions and put them with fresh cucumbers, just from the vine, 
washed and wiped dry, into the Spiced vinegar, using enough cucumbers to 
fill the jar. Agitate the pickles every other niorning for several months 
or until cool weather comes. Then add more sugar until the pickles 
have a pleasant tasle. 

Pickled Walnuts. — The walnuts must be gathered while young and 
green, and be laid tn strong brine. Leave them in this for a week, 
changing it every other day. Take them out, dry them between two 
cloths and pierce each with a large needle. Throw them into cold 
water and leave them several hours before packing them in small jars 
and pouring over them scalding hot seasoned vinegar, prepared in the 
following proportions : Four quarts of vinegar, one cupful of sugar, 
three dozen cloves, three dozen black peppers, 18 whole allspice and 13 
' blades of mace boiled together for live minutes. 

Yellow Mustard Pickle.— One-half gallon vinegar, three dozen sliced 
cucumbers, three dozen onions, one tablespoonful turmeric, one table- 
spoon mustard, one-half cup each of sugar and flour, and one-third 
teaspoon of red pepper. Pare and slice cucumbers and onions, cover 
with water, add one-half cup salt and let stand over night. In the 
morning drain the cucumbers and onions; put vinegar on the stove to

boiling vinegar and let boil five minutes, stirring constantly ; then put 
ill cucumbers and onions, boil 15 minutes and seal in jars while hot. 

Vinegar for Yellow Pickles. — This may be used for cucumbers, to- 
matoes or any other vegetable desired. Use one-half pound of grated 
horseradish, one pound of white mustard seed, one-half pound of black 
mustard seed, one ounce each of mace, nutmegs, cloves, allspice and 
ground white pepper, two ounces of turmeric, one-half cupful of ground 
mustard, two lablespoonfuls of celery seed, four cloves of garlic, one- 
quarter pound of ground ginger and two pounds of brown sugar. Pat 
in a three-gallon jar with two gallons of vinegar. Stir frequently and let 
remain for several weeks before using. This Will keep any length of 
time. Half quantity may be prepared for the use of a small family. 

Corn Vinegar. — A friend says she prefers this to cider vinegar: 
One pint corn cut from cob; one pint of brown sugar or molasses, to

one gallon of rain water. Put in a large jar^ Keep covered with a 
clolh. Set in (he snn. In a month you will have good vinegar. 

Fruit Vinegars, — Among suggestions for making vinegar given by a 
correspondent of Good Housekeeping, it is stated that half-gallon fruit 
jars are better than stone jugs to make it in, as a larger, surface is 
exposed to the light and air, and by shaking often, oxygenation, souring, 
is hastened. A cloth should, of course, be tied over (he top to keep out 
insects and dust. The jars should be set in the sun, and whenever the 
fluid has worked clear, strain off and leave it in a warm place until it is 
as sharp as desired. When mother forms, new vinegar can be made by 
simply adding sweetened water. Always use soft water, but if it is not 
available, boil the water and set it in the sun a day or two. To make 
vinegar from apple or peach parings, fill a jar half full of parings, add 
one-half teacup molasses, and fill up with water. Set in the sun and 
strain for use in about two weeks. Tomato vinegar is made by mashing 
and straining a quart of ripe tomatoes, putting in a jar with one cupful 
of sugar or molasses, then filling the jar with soft water, and keeping in 
a sunny place two weeks. In default of other material vinegar may be 
made frttm yeast. Dissolve half a teacupful of brown sugar in one pint 
of warm water, add one small yeast cake, and fill the jar with water. 
This must be left to work for two weeks. 

Gooseberry Vinegar. — Boil one gallon of water; when cold add thre* 
quarts of ripe gooseberries, mashed. Allow it to stand for four days, 
stirring every day. On the fourth day strain through a sieve to remove 
the seeds, then barrel. To etch gallon of the liquid add 1]4 pound 
sugar, and one-eighth cake of compressed yeast. We used to use barm 
(the foam from fermenting beer) which was the ordinary form of yeast 
years ago in communities where home brewing was practiced. Stir every 
day until the vinegar has done fermenting, then close the barrel. Green 
or amber gooseberries are best. This is a very superior vinegar. 

Honey Vinegar. — One friend says she uses i '/i pound of strained 
honey to a gallon of water, but Bulletin 146 of the Ontario (Canada) 
Deparlment of Agriculture advises l'/> ounce of honey to one gallon of 
dear, soft water. Store in a barrel with an opening to permit air circu- 
lation, in a warm place; at the end of a year it is ready for use. The 
Ontario bulletin says its keeping 'qualities are excellent, and the best of 
pickles can be made with it, while it is recommended for salads. 

Spiced Vinegar. — This gives a fine flavor to green vegetables, such as 
cucumbers, cabbage, caidiflowcr, beans, salads, etc. For each quart of 
vinegar slice a clove of garlic, a small onion, a two-inch root of horse- 
radish, half an ounce of bruised ginger root, a teaspoonfu! each of 
unground black pepper, allspice and mustard seed. Put all in a stone jar 
and simmer on the rangt for five hours. Then strain and bottle for use.

CATSUPS AND SAUCES. 

Barberry Catsap. — Stew three quarts of barberries with three copfnlt 
of water till well cooked, then strain through a sieve. In a separate 
saucepan stew four quarts of cranberries, a cupful of raisins, a large 
quince sliced, four smai! onions minced and a quart of water for half an 
hour, then pass thrnugh a sieve; mix with the barberry juice and add 
half a cupful of vinegar, one-fourth of a cupful of salt, two pupfuls of 
brown sugar, a dessertspoonful each of ground cloves and ground all- 
spice, two tablespoon fuls each' of olack pf^^ and celery seed, one 
teaspoonful of cayenne, cinnamon and ginger j^d a grated nutmeg. Let 
the whole boil one minute. -If too thick add vinegar or water. This recipe 
is given by Miss Parlna; some cooks make the catSup omitting the quince 
and cranberries. ■. ■ ., _ 

Bordeaux Sauos.ir^Two quarts of cabbage chopped to a powder, one 
quart of cl en '-tomatoes, drained free of juice, three small oniops 

chopped, a of vinegar, one-quarter ounce each of celery seed,

one-quarfi^ il salt, and one-half pound of brown sugar; mix 

together, b utes, and can while hot. . 

Chili S^uce. — I'eel' and chop fine one onion, and six large tomatoes, 
add one jjreen e'A'eet Spanish pepper and one small hot chili pepper, 
chopped; .!^en season with one cupful of vinegar, one tablespoanful sail, 
two teaspoojifuls brown sugar, one teaspoonful each of ground ginger, 
cinnamoi^^puves and black pepper, and half a nutmeg. Boil slowly until ' 
very tho&ighly cooked, then bottle and seal when cold. 

Chutney Sauce.— Eight ounces of tart apples, peeled and cored, eight 
ounces of peeled tomatoes, eight ounces brown sugar, eight ounces salt, 
four ounces- -pWdered ginger, four ounces red peppers, two ounces 
shallots (or onion), two ounces garlic. Pound all together in a mortar 
(or pass thniugb a chopper set to cut line} and then put all the material! 
together in a jar with 2J^ pints good vinegar. Place the jar in a warm 
place, covered for one month, stirring with a wooden spoon twice every 
day. At the end of the time pass the chutney through a sieve, and bottle, 
when it is ready for use. The intense heat of the peppers grows milder 
with keeping, and the chutney improves and becomes richer in flavor. 

Peach Chutney. — Pare and halve spffident peaches to weigh, when 
ready, three pounds. Put them in a la^jS-sgate saucepan, add one pint 
of vinegar and stew gently t'ntil tender,.^-Pound together in a mortar 
four ounces of white onions, two ounces garlic and five ounces of fresh 
ginger root ; add these to the peaches with six ounces each of sugar, 
seeded raisins and white mustard seed. Add two ounces of dried chillies 
and one cupful of vinegar. Simmer for 10 minutes longer, then bottle. 
This is a familiar old English recipe.

Prepared Dressing. — Here :s a delicious salad dressing, which will keep 
a long time if put on ice, or in a cold place. Mix half a cupful of oil, 
five tablespoonfuls vinegar, half a teaspoonful powdered sugar, half a 
small Bermuda onion, finely chopped, two tablespoonfuls chopped parsley, 
half a tablespoonful chopped red pepper, one tablespoonful chopped green 
pepper, one teaspoonful salt. Let it stand for an hour, then whip up 
with an e^ beater before using. 

Sour Cream Dressing.-;-Chill a cupful of rich sour cream until very 
cold, then beat well foi'-five minutes, adding, while beating, a tablespoon- 
ful of powdered sugar and a half teaspoonful of lemon juice. Slice 
chilled cucumbers very thin, and serve with this dressing. 

Salad Dressing Without Oil. — Piece of butter the size of an egg. 
Heat in granite basin, add sifted flour till thick. Then add one cupful 
of milk. When smooth add one cupful vinegar; two eggs (beaten); salt,

pepper, red or black, iniistard, seasoned as you wish ; one tablespoon of 
sugar. Cook till tliiek. The iidilion of a half ciipful of well-beaten sour 
or sweet cream will be fouiiii excellent. This dressing on potatoes, cu- 
cumbers, Ictluce or beets makes a most pal.itable salad. The friend who 
gave this sajs it is a dressing that will keep for some time. She always 
kerps a jar of it on hand. The left-over dish of beets, peas or string 
beans is put in the potato salad for supper. 

Mayonnaise. — Put the uncocked yolks of two eggs into an earthen 
bowl, beat them well with a silver or wooden fork for about one minute; 
then add a half teaspoonful of salt, a dash of cayenne, and if you desire. 
a half-teaspoonful of mustard. Work these well together, and then add 
drop by drop, a half pint or more of olive oil. Stir rapidly and steadily 
while adding the oil ; do not reverse the motion, or the mayonnaise may 
curdle. After stirring in the first gill of oil, alternate occasionally with 
a few drops of lemon juice or vinegar. The more oil you use, the thicker 
the dressing. If too thick, add vinegar enough to make it the proper 
consistency. The mayonnaise should be kept as cool as possible during 
tlie making. 

Banana Salad. — The bananas are peeled, sliced lengthwise down the 
middle, dipped in mayonnaise, and laid, flat side up, on lettuce leaver. 
A layer of finely chopped peanuts is put on the banana, and a spoonful of 
mayonnaise dressing put by it. Serve with healed graham crackers. This 
ii delicious. 

Beet Salad.— Slice and cut into dice enough cold boiled beets to make 
a pint; heap in the center of a salad dish, and cover with sauce Tartare. 
This is made by adding a f<;w chopped olives, gherkins and capers to 
mayonnaise dressing. If the mayonnaise is not desired, any ordinary salad 
mixture may be used, and the salad garnished with hard-boiled eggs and 

Cream Slaw. — Cut a small half head of white, tender cabbage on a 
flaw cutter (or fine, with a sharp knife) ; sprinkle a very little black 
pepper over it, and add one-third of small teaspoonful of salt. Have 
ready a small half pint of thick sweet cream ; add to this three even 
tahlespoonfuls of granulated sugar; stir until dissolved, then whip this 
to a stiff froth, adding gradually two and a half tahlespoonfuls of good 
vinegar. When finished ponr over the cabbage, stirring it lightly until 
all is covered and stand in refrigerator, or in cold water, for 10 or 15 
minutes before serving. The slaw should, not be made too long before 
serving, as the cold, crisp taste is most appetizing. 

Herring Salad. — Heat through by broiling, or in the oven, three smoked 
herrings. Then tear oft the heads and pull the skin. away; split, take out 
the backbones, and cut up into small bits, or to shred them is better. 
Put in a salad bowl, add one small chopped onion, two hard-boiled eggs, 
chopped, and one boiled potato ; cut fine with a teaspoonful of chopped 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 18S 

parsley; season with a teaspoonful of salt, one of pepper, three table- 
spoonfuls of vinegar and two of oil ; mix well, and if you have it, deco- 
rate with a boiled beet. 

Hot Slaw. — C..i a head of cabbage line. Have ready enoi^h dressing, 
half vinegar and half water, and one-fourth sugar, with a lump of butter 
to cover it. Simmer until done. It is good cold. It is well to salt the 
dressing a little, to taste. 

Potato Salad. — Slice cold boiled potatoes with one raw -onion to sea- 
son. For the salad dressing, put on stove a saucepan with one pint of 
vinegar and butter the size of an egg. Beat two or three eggs with two 
tablespoonfuls of mustard and a small teaspoonful of salt, and one of 
black pepper, two tablespoonfuls of sugar. When thoroughly beaten pour 
slowly into the vinegar uritil it thickens. Be careful not to cook too 
long, or the egg will curdle. Remove and when cold pour over the salad. 
It improves this to add the yolks of two or three hard boiled eggs mashed 
fine and beaten in with the mustard, or add a cupful of cream. This will 
keep several days in a cool place if desired. Plain French dressing may 
be used instead if desired. 

German Potato Salad, — Boil a few extra potatoes at dinner time. 
When cold, carefully slice very thin. Set away to chill. When supper 
time comes, cut for a quart of sliced potatoes one good-sized onion into 
thin slices. Add a dash of p^^PP^r, Take two big slices of bacon, very 
fat, cut into cubes, fry, add one-half cupful of vinegar. Pour over the 
falad anil toss-lightly with two forks. 

Waldorf Salad. — Handsome red apples are selected, polished, but not 
peeled, cored, and then hollowed into cups. The pieces removed are 
mixed with chopped celery, put in the apple cups, a spoonful of mayon- 
naise dressing being put over the top. The apples are put on individual 
plates, each fruit standing on a crinkly lettuce leaf.

CHAPTER XIV. 

Cottage theese.— Bulletin No. B45, issued by the New York Experi- 
ment Station at Geneva, is devoted to this subject; it will be found help- 
ful by anyone making this cheese, either for market or domestic use. In 
describing the manufacture of this cheese, the bulletin says that good 
cottage cheese should have a soft, smooth texture, being neither mushy 
nor dry and sawdust like. The flavor should be that of mildly soured 
milk or well ripened cream, with an entire absence of bitter taste, flavor 
of stable, or other objectionable qualities. Such flavor may usually be 
secured by the use of a good starter; but if too much whey is retained 
the cheese may be sour. Flavor and texture are quite closely connected, 
at this poin^ for a slow draining curd is liable to result in poor textured 
and poor flavored cheese. The various steps in making cottage cheese 
may be summarized as follows. 

Use skim-milk rather than whole milk, to avoid loss of fat. To se- 
cure proper flavor and speedy souring add a small amount of a good 
starter. This starter should be prepared from clean, fresh mill^ sep- 
arated from the cream and placed in a carefully cleaned receptacle, well 
covered and brought to a temperature of 90 degrees, and then allowed to 
stand from 20 to 24 hours at a temperature of 65 to 78 degrees. The 
upper portion of this should be discarded and the amount needed strained 
through a fine strainer Or hair sieve and thoroughly mixed with the milk 
from which cheese is to be made the next day. A portion may also be 
used in preparing a Starter for the next day, but as soon as any unfav- 
orable eSect is noticed a new starter should be prepared. Several good 
and convenient commercial starters are on the market, for use of which 
directions accompany each package. 

The milk is now kept at a temperature of 70 to 79 degrees until well 
curdled, often in 24 hours, sometimes not until 48 hours. The curdled 
mass is broken up by hand or by a curd knife, raised gradually to flO de- 
grees, taking 30 to 40 minutes in the process. The whey should then 
separate clear in IS to 20 minutes, after which it is run from the curd, 
and the latter placed in muslin bags or on racks to drain. When whey 
ceases to come from the curd, salt is added to taste or at the rate of 
about a pound for 100 pounds of cheese, the curd formed into balls and 
wrapped in oiled paper that may be obtained from any dairy supply 
house. For the finest quality of cheese, thick cream, preferably ripened 
cream, should be added at the rate of about an ounce for one pound

of cheese, before the cheese is made into bath. If it is thought best to 
hasten the curdling rennet extract may be added about eight hours after 
the starter has been introduced, using one ounce of rennet extract for 
1,QOO pounds of milk. 

Escalloped Cheese.— Into a buttered baking dish sprinkle a layer of 
coarse bread crumbs, with butter, pepper and salt on top. Next add a 
layer of cheese, alternatii^ with bread and cheese until the dish is full. 
Have bread crtunbs on top, pour on sweet milk until you can see it by 
tilting the dish a little, and bake until done. * 

Cheese Fondu. — Put one tablespoonful of butter in pan, then one cup 
milk; let it boil, then add one cup bread crumbs and two cups grated 
cheese, little pepper and dry mustard. When the cheese melts add two 
well-beaten e^S. 

Macaroni with Cheese. — Throw one-half box of macaroni into boiling 
water and cook ao minutes. Never let the water stop'boiling, or the 
macaroni will be soft. Drain and pour into a buttered baking dish. Have 
ready one cup of cheese cut into small pieces and stir this through the 
hot macaroni together with salt and pepper to taste and a lump of butter 
the size of a small egg. Add enough sweet milk almost to cover and 
sprinkle the top with more grated cheese Bake three-quarters of an 
hour in a moderate oven. A good suppci' dish on a cold night. 

Cheese Fatties.— When making pies line a number of patty pans with 
thin paste and bake. These will keep several days, but are better fresh. 
Grate one-fourth pound cheese and add one pint milk, one tablespoon 
flour, one-half teaspoon mustard or one dessertspoon prepared mustard, 
one tablespoon butter and salt and pepper to taste. Carefully heat to- 
gether, stirring to make a smooth mass. Serve hot in the patty shells. 

Cheese Puffs. — Make some puff paste; roll it out and cut it into squares 
of about three inches. Beat the yolks of two eggs and a little made mus- 
tard, a da.sh of cayenne pepper and two tablespoonfuls of grated cheese, 
to form a thick paste. Place a spoonful of the mixture in each square 
of pastry, pull the four points to the center, pinching them together to 
make them stand up. Bake 10 minutes and serve very hot. 

Cheese Pudding. — Lay thin slices of stale bread, lightly buttered, in a 
baking dish, and cover with broken cheese, no matter how old and. dry 
it is. Season with red pepper and salt. Fill the dish with alternate 
layers of bread and cheese. Beat two eggs in a pint of milk, pour over 
the bread and cheese, and bake in a hot oven. This will serve six per- 

Spanish Rabbit — To a cupful of grated cheese add two-thirds the 
quantity of minced oni^, which is first cooked in boiling water. Drain 
and add milk almost tb cover the onions ; season with salt and pepper 
and when the milk is hot put in the cheese. As soon as the cheese is 
melted stir in one well-beaten egg. Cook a moment longer and serve. 



in THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Cheese Ramekins.— Two ounces of bread crumbs boiled in one gill 
of milk; to this add four tables poonfuls of grated cheese, two of melted 
bulter, and stir over the lire until blended. Take off and add the beaten 
yolks of two eggs, salt and pepper to taste. Beat the whites of three 
e^:s stiff, stir carefully into the mixture, and bake 13 minutes in a quick 
oven. 

Cheese Souffle, — Put two tablespoon fuls of butler in a saucepan; when 
it ntjits add one heaping tab'espoontui of flour, stir until smooth; add a 
half-cup of milk, a saltspoonful of salt and a saltspoonful of paprika; 
cook two mfciutes; add Ihc well-bsaten yolks of three eggs and one cup 
of grated cheese, but take it off the fire just before adding them, and 
when you stir them all in well set it away to cool. When cold add the 
stiffly beaten whites of the eggs, turn into a buttered dish and place im- 
mediately in the oven and bake 2S or 30 minutes. Have a folded napkin 
ready to wrap around the dish and serve it immediately, or it will fall. 

Cheese Sticks. — Mix together one pint grated cheese, one pint flour, 
one tablespoon bulter, two scant teaspoons baking powder, a little salt 
and a dash of pepper. Mix with milk or water and roll thin like pis 
crust. Cut into strips four or five inches long and nearly an inch wide. 
Bake in a quick oven. 

Cheese Straws. — One cupful of grated cheese and one tabtespoonful of 
butteF creamed together; two slices of bread, without crust, dried in oven 
and roiled fine. Four tablesp"onfuls of cold water, pinch of salt, dust 
of red pepper, and flour enough to roll out. Cut in strips and bake a 
delicate brown. 

Cheese Toast.t— Grate a cupful of cheese, and lightly mix in a heaping 
saltspoonful of muslard, a half- salt spoonful of salt and a speck of cay- 
enne. Heap this on thin strips or triangles of buttered toast, place them 
in a hot oven for a few moments, and serve as soon as the c-heese begins 
to melt. Any kind of a thin cracker may be used instead, and a dusting 
of paprika over each piece in place of the cayenne. 

Welsh Custards. — One cupful of dry grated cheese, four c^s. one cup- 
ful of milk, one teaspoonful of butter, two of flour, mixed with milk, a 
bit of soda size of pea, half i teaspoonful of salt and a pinch of cayenne. 
Heat the milk, stirring in the soda, butler, salt and pepper, and the flour 
mixture, and pour scalding hot on ihe eggs beaten light in a bowl. Add 
the cheese, beat up for a minute, pour into buttered custard cups and 
bake in a brisk oven for 20 minutes. They should be served instantly.

CHAPTER XV. 

WARM SUPPBR AND BREAKFAST DISHES. 

Anchovy Toast. — Toast a small round of bread for each person, butter 
and put in vegetable dish. Make a sauce of one pint of milk and two 
tables poo nfuls of flour; when thickened add level saltspoonful of salt, 
dash of cayenne and three teaspoonfuls of anchovy essence or five 
anchovies boned and pounded. Pour over the toast; serve hot. 

Arrowroot Cream Toast.- -First put into a double boiler a scant pinl 
of rich milk and a teaeupful of cream; let it come to the boiling point, 
tlien add a large tablespoonful of fresh butter and a tablespoonful of 
arrowroot wetted in a little milk or cream ; season to taste with salt, and 
lijt it boil up. Toast light slices of bre.id, browning evenly. Put two 
slices at a lime into the sauce, and as soon as they soften all through, 
which will only take a short time, put in a covered dish kept hot. Pour 
a little sauce over each layer, and serve the toast while very hot. 

Golden Cream Toast.— Cut slices of stale bread into diamonds and 
toast to a pale brown, drying slightly in the oven before browning. Make 
a rich white sauce of a pint of milk, three tablespoonfuls of butter, two 
tablespoonfuls of flour, half a teaspoonful of salt, a dusting of mace and 
a light dusting of pepper. Cook until smooth, add the grated yolks 
of three hard-boiled eggs and pour over the toasted bread. 

Baked Toast. — Prepare toast in the ordinary way, and, as each slice 
is ready, dip quickly into a pan of boiling water slightly salted, then 
pack into a baking dish, sprinkle well with salt, and cover deep with 
boiling milk. Bake in a dish, closely covered, for 15 minutes, and serve. 
The toast should have absorbed all the liquid without getting dry. If 
you can spare three or four tablespoonfuls of cream, heat, and pour over 
the surface just before sending to the table. The baking lends smooth- 
ness and richness to this dish not to be found in milk toast prepared in 
the usual way. 

Bread Croquettes.-^Rub the inside of a loaf of stale bread through 
a colander, then measure. To one good quart add one pint of milk and 
heat over the fire in a double boiler. As soon as it reaches the scalding 
point take it off, let stand for a moment, then add one-half of a cupful 
of cleaned, currants, two tablespoonfuls of chopped citron, one-half of a 
teaspoonful of cinnamon, two tablespoonfuls of chopped almonds and 
the beaten yolks of two raw eggs. Return to the fire and stir and cook 
for two minutes, then turn out on a greased dish and set aside until cold. 
Form carefully into small cylinders, dip each in egg, roll in fine dried 
crumbs and fry golden brown in hot fat. Serve with a foamy sauce. 



IM THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Cheese Pie. — Cut bread into one-third inch slices, cutting each slice in 
half. Butter a shallow bakiy dish, put in a layer of bread, then a layer 
of soft mild cheese, cut in one-eighth inch slices, and sprinkled with salt 
and paprika or pepper. Beat two eggs slightly and add one cup of milk. 
Pour over the bread and bake until the cheese is soft, which will take 
about 30 minutes. 

HuUed Corn au Gratin. — For one quart of hulled corn prepare a pint 
of rich cream sauce, flavoring it with Worcestershire sauce or other 
condiments to make it piquant. Put the sauce and corn in a baking dish 
or individual ramekins in alternate layers, sprinkle the top with grated 
cheese and a dusting of paprika, and bake until well browned on top. 

Noodles. — Beat an egg slightly, but not until it foams ; salt it to 
season the dough, and then work in all the flour the egg can be made 
to take up. Take the dough on to the board and knead in flour until it 
is stiff and smooth, then roll out as thin as possible. Let the 'sheet of 
dough dry for a while, but roll it into a roll like a jelly roll belbre it 
gets dry enough to break when rolled; slice from the end, and shake into 
strings. The thinner the dough is rolled, and the finer it is cut the better 
the noodles are. A very thin, sharp knife makes the work of cutting 
much easier and insures much finer noodles. The directions given call 
for one egg as a basis, but the method of making is exactly the same if 
six, or a dozen eggs are used. Three medium-sized eggs will make a 
sheet of dough SO inches square if properly rolled out, and wilt be 
enough for a family of six or eight hungry people. When dry enough 
to roll and cut, the noodles are dry enough to cook, but they may be kept 
for hours or days, after they are cut. 

Cheese Noodles. — Make your noodles the day before you want to use 
them and shave fine. Drop lightly into boiling water and allow them to 
cook 15 minutes over a hot Are. Do not let them simmer, or they will 
turn out a mushy mass. Drain and fill a rather deep pan to the depth 
of two inches. Season with salt and pepper and pour over them enough 
sweet milk almost to cover. Over the tap grate cheese to the depth of 
half an inch, cover and bake one hour, removing cover the last 15 min- 
utes unless oven is too- hot. 

Rice Croquettes. — To one tcacupful of boiled rice, add one teaspoonful 
of butter, a beaten egg, a seasoning of salt and pepper, and mix well to- 
gether. Mold into rolls, or small cakes, dip into egg, and then into pow- 
dered cracker crumbs and fry in hot butter or drippings. A little finely 
chopped cold meat is an improvement; it should be mixed with the rice 
and e^ before molding. 

Rice Muffins.-— One pint of milk, one pint boiled rice, two eggs, two table- 
spoonfuls of sugar, one tablespoonful of butter, one teaspoonful each of 
salt and baking powder. Beat the sugar, salt, yolks of egga and butter 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. Ml 

together, add the milk and sufficient flour to make a thin batter; sift the 
rice in lightly, and last the beaten whites. Bake in rings 30 minutes. 

Royal Toast.~Put bread toasted a delicate brown in a square shallow 
pan ; put a piece of butter the size of a walnut on' each slice, and sprinkle 
with sugar. Arrange in layers, and pour over the whole enough milk 
or cream to half fill the pan. Cover closelyand set in a slow oven until 
the liquid is all absorbed. 

Swiss Toast. — Mash one-half box of berries, but not too fine; sweeten 
one-quarter cufi of sugar, then cut five slices of stale bread as for toast- 
ing. Cover each slice with the berries. Retain some of the juice so as 
not to make the bread too soft. Heat about two tablespoon fuls of but- 
ter in a large frying pan ; put the slices with the berries on them carefully 
into the hot butter and fry slowly until the bread is browned on the un- 
derside, basting the berries with the butter while in the pan. Transfer the 
bread and berries to a hot platter; pour the rest ff the juice over them 
and serve immediately. 

Tomato Toast. — This can often be made from stewed or scalloped to- 
matoes left over from dinner; the extra juice from canned tomatoes 
which often makes them seem too watery, is useful for the toast. The 
tomato is simmered with the proper flavoring, strained through a sieve, 
and then thickened with flour and butter before being poured over the 
toast. If one wishes to makejnore of a dish, crisp fried bacon may be 
served with it, or a spoonful of minced ham or other cooked meat may 
be put on the top of each piece of toast before the tomato is poured 
over it 

Creamed Tomatoes. — Peel several tomatoes and cut them in moderately 
thick slices. Fry them in butter, seasoning them as they are frying with 
pepper and salt Remove them carefully to a platter, leaving the shreds 
of the tomatoes that have fallen off. Pour into the pan about three- 
quarters of a cup of rich milk and thicken with flour. Pour this sauce 
over the tomatoes. 

Blueberry Pancakes.— Sift one scant pint of flour with one teaspoonful 
of baking powder and a half-teaspoonful of salt. Mix two well-beaten 
eggs with 254 cuptuls of sweet milk and thoroughly blend all together. 
Grease the griddle, drop the batter on in large spoonfuls and spread a 
teaspoonful of blueberries on each, pressing into the 'cake. Turn, and 
when brown serve with butter and powdered sugar. 

Buckwheat Cakes. — One pint milk scalded and cooled, one-half tea- 
spoonful salt. When lukewarm add one-fourth of a yeast cake which has 
been dissolved in a little warm water; one cup buckwheat flour and one 
cup white flour. Let rise over night. In the morning stir in one-fourth 
teaspoonful of soda and one tablespoonful molasses. Beat vigorously 
before cooking. 

Mixed Buckwheat Cakes.— Sift together two cupful* of buckwheat. 



^■v 



lea THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

one cupful of rolled oats, one cupful of cornmeal, one scant teaspoonfnl 

of salt. Mix to a pour batter, with equal parts of milk and water, add 
one-third of a cake of compressed yeast, cover and stand in a warm 
place over night; before baking add one-third of a teaspoonful of soda 
dissolved in hot water. These are good and easy of digestion. 

Ctumb Croquettes. — Melt a tablespoonful of butter in a frying paa 
and add a tablespoonful of Hour ; a cupful of sweet milk, and salt aod 
pepper to season. Cook until it thickens, then add one beaten egg. Re- 
move from the lire and mix in bread crumbs until the mixture is thidc 
Make into balls and let get cold Roll in egg and crumbs; fry in deep 
fat like other croquettes. a 

Crumb Pancakes.— Two cupfuls sour miik, one-half teaspoonful soda, 
two cupfuls stale bread crumbs, two eggs, two cupfuls flour, two levd 
teaspoonfuls baking powder, pinch of salt. Soak bread crumbs in the 
milk over night, add jl is solved soda; if one has stale Johnny cake a 
change may be made by using one cupful bread crumbs and one cupful 
Johnny cake crumbs. In the morning add the eggs, well beaten, then sift 
in the flour and baking powder. It may be that two cupfuls of floor 
will not be needed to make a suitable batter; use just enough. 

French Pancakes. — Beat five eggs very light, add two tablespoonfuls 
of melted butter, one and one-half pints of milk, and enough wheat 
flour, sifted with two teaspoonfuls of l^ing powder, to make a good 
batter. About a quart of flour will be needed. Melt a little butter in a 
large frying pan, and pour the batter into this. When brown on tntc 
side, turn carefully and brown on the other. When done, spread quicHy .-'^ 
with fruit jelly, and roU up as you would a sheet of music. Transfer 
carefully tb a very hot dish, sprinkle with powdered sugar, or with pow- , , 
dcred sugar and ground cinnamon, and serve immediately. ^ . 

Flannel Cakes. — One cupful of Indian meal, two cupfuls of flour, three ■. 
of boiling milk, one-fourth of a yeast cake, one teaspoonful of salt, two ■*" 
tablespoonfuls of butter and one of sugar. Pour the boiling milk upiffl '. 
the meal and butter; let it cool; then add the flour, salt, sugar and the 
portion of yeast dissolved in four tablespoonfuls of cold water. Let it .f' 
rise over night, and in the morning fry as you would griddle cakes. 

Yeast Flannel Cakes, — Heat a half-pint of sweet milk and into it pat 
one heaping tablespoonful butter, let it melt, add a half pint cold i 
and the well beaten yolks of two eggs, a half teaspoonful of salt, two 
tablespoonfuls homemade yeast, and flour lo make a stiff batter, 
rise in a warm place over night. Before baking add the beaten whiteS) 
which have been kept in a cool place during the night. Be sure to make 
batter Eliff enough, as flour must not be added after it has risen. Theu^.J 
cakes, half cornmeal and half wheat, are very nice.

PREFACE 



For many years The R. N.-Y. has been collecting tested recipes from 
an immense army of practical housewives. Some are entirely original; 
others are doubtless modifications of familiar practice. It is an easy 
matter to mislay a recipe not needed for immediate use, and we are thus 
often asked to repeat their publication, not once, but perhaps a dozen 
times. For this reason it seemed wise to print a selection of these recipes 
in permanent form, and "The Rural Cook Book" was decided upon, as 
a successor to "The Business Hen" and "The Farmer's Garden." Before 
we had finished assembling our material, however, we discovered that we 
had enough recipes alone to fill four books of the required size, and the 
question became not what to put in, but what to leave out. It was decided 
that we must give as much space as possible to canning, preserving, 
pickling, and other uses of fruit and vegetables, as such recipes are 
especially useful to farm housekeepers. This little book is not intended, 
however, to be a complete guide to domestic economy; in spite of its 
omissions we feel sure that it will be found a real practical helper, and 
we also think it will fill a place left vacant by many a more pretentious 
volume.

CHAPTER I. 

SOUPS. 

Here are some certain rules of health; 

Take them — they're hetter far than wealth : 

Don't overeat, don't overdrink, 

Don't overwork, don't overthink. 

Be not afraid of honest sweat ; 

Run like a deer from shame and debt. 

Beware of bigness of the head. 

Get bigness of the soul Instead. 

Almond and Celery Soup. — Cut in small pieces a bunch of celery, 
using the leaves and carefully scraped root; add six peppercorns, two 
bay leaves, a tablespoonful of onion juice, a thin slice of lemon, a tea- 
spoonful of salt, and a stick of cinnamon; cover with a quart of water 
and cook an hour, strain and reheat, stirring in a cup of rich milk (cream 
is better), a teaspoonful each of flour and butter blended together, and 
one-quarter of a cup of blanched almonds that have been pounded to a 
paste, allowing soup to boil for a moment or two after the nuts are 
added. Serve very hot with cheese crackers. 

English Beef Soup. — Take the cracked joints of beef, and after put- 
ting the meat in the pot and covering it well with water let it come 
to a boil, when it should be well skimmed. Set the pot where the meat 
will simmer slowly until it is thoroughly done, keeping it closely cov- 
ered all the tirne. The next day, or when cold, remove the fat which 
hardens on the top of the soup. Peel, wash and slice three good-sized 
potatoes and put them into the soup; cut up half a head of white cab- 
bage in shreds and add to this a pint of Shaker corn that has been 
soaked over night, two onions, one head of celery, and tomatoes, if de- 
sired. When these are done, and they should simmer slowly, care being 
taken that they do not burn, strain (or not, as preferred) the soup and 
serve. The different varieties of beef soup are formed by this method 
of seasoning and the different vegetables used in preparing it after the 
joints have been well boiled. Besides onions, celery, cabbage, tomatoes 
and potatoes, many use a few carrots, turnips, beets and force-meat balls, 
seasoned with spice. Rice or barley will give the soup consistency, and 
are to be preferred to flour for the purpose. Parsley, thyme and sage 
are the favorite herbs for seasoning, but should be used sparingly. To 
make force-meat balls add to one pound chopped beef one egg, a small 
lump of butter, a cup or less of bread crumbs; season with salt and 
pepper and moisten with water from stewed meat; make in balls and

fry brown, or make egg-balls by boiling eggs, mashing the yollcs with a 
silver spoon and mixing with one raw yolk and one teaspoonful of flour ; 
season with salt and pepper, make into balls; drop in soup just before 
serving. 

Black Bean or Lentil Soup. — Soak a pint of black beans or lentils over 
night. In the morning, parboil them. Boil gently in fresh water until 
soft enough to rub through a sieve. Add a bay leaf, some cloves, and 
a stalk of celery. Brown two slices of bacon cut in dice with half a 
minced onion and turn into the soup. Serve with squares of toast. 

Brown Flour Soup. — Put a lump of butter into a clean iron frying 
pan. When melted, sprinkle in half a cupful of flour and stir briskly 
until the flour is of a uniform brown color like roasted coffee. Add this 
gradually to two quarts of water. Peel and cut into cubes three pota- 
toes and cook in the soup 20 minutes. Season with an onion and a tea- 
spoonful of celery salt. 

Consomme. — Cut up two pounds of lean raw meat, beef or veal, and 
add a cupful of cold roast beef, cut in pieces. Put over the fire with a 
cracked knuckle of veal, four quarts of cold water, two onions, one 
carrot, two stalks of celery, six peppercorns, a spoonful of salt, six 
cloves and a few herbs. Cook slowly all day. Strain, and when cold 
skim off the fat. Add the white and shells of two eggs. Bring to a 
boil and boil 10 minutes. Strain through a cloth. 

Corn Chowder. — Pare and slice thin onions enough to make a pint; 
boil one hour ; to this add one-half pint potatoes cut small, boil 10 
ininutes longer. Fry brown a slice of fat salt pork cut small and add 
fat and all, then a pint of tender sweet corn (canned corn is all right). 
Boil 10 njinutes longer; the whole of this now should be two quarts or 
more; this is the best time to salt and pepper to taste. Add one pint 
of milk and a cupful of cream or a piece of butter as large as an egg if 
cream is not plentiful. Do not let cream boil ; serve very hot. 

Cream of Corn Soup. — Scrape the corn from eight tender young 
ears. Boil the cobs in as little water as may be for 30 minutes. Strain 
off the liquid, add the scraped corn and boil 20 minutes. Heat one quart 
of sweet milk to scalding point; rub together one tablespoonful butter 
and one teaspoonful flour ; stir into the hot milk. Add one-half tea- 
spoonful salt, one-quarter teaspoonful white pepper. Pour over the corn, 
stir for a minute or two, then pour into hot tureen. Serve with crou- 
tons. Croutons — Cut bread two days old into small triangles or dice. 
Brown in oven to a golden tint. They are very nice spread with a paste 
made of twice the quantity of butter creamed, of delicate cheese grated 
and a little finely chopped parsley. (Two teaspoons butter, one of grated 
cheese, one-fourth teaspoon chopped parsley). The croutons can be 
fried if desired. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 9 

Cream of Eggs. — Slice a medium-sized onion into a quart of milk 
and bring the milk to the scalding point in a double boiler. Strain 
out the onion and return the milk to the kettle with a teaspoonful of 
flcur that has been rubbed "^o a paste with the same quantity of butter. 
Stir to a smooth cream-like soup, and just before serving season with 
one teaspoonful of salt and three shakes of pepper. Chop coarsely, the 
white of four or five hard-b'oiled eggs and add to the soup. When 
ready to serve sprinkle each portion with the grated yolks. 

Cream of Salsify. — Take two bunches of salsify, wash, scrape and cut 
in small pieces and boil until tender. While hot mash and press through 
a colander. Have ready a cream made of two tablespoons of flour and 
two of butter melted together, seasoned with one-half saltspoonful white 
pepper and stirred into three cups milk and one cup water, which have 
previously been brought to a boil. Stir constantly until the consistency 
of a puree ; add the prepared salsify, let boil up o"nce, add three-quarters 
of a teaspoonful salt, and serve immediately. 

Fish Chowder. — Two pounds of fresh cod or any white fish, a quar- 
ter-pound bacon, four large potatoes, one small onion, half a can tomatoes, 
one quart milk, butter the size of a walnut, and a teaspoonful of flour 
for thickening. Pick the fish to pieces, removing all bone and skin; 
peel potatoes and cut into dice; cut the bacon in small pieces; rub the 
butter and flour to a cream. On the bottom of a granite kettle spread 
half of the potatoes in a layer, then half of fish, then sprinkle in the 
onions minced fine, then the bacon, then half the tomatoes. Then a 
shake of salt and pepper; add the rest of the fish, potatoes, tomatoes and 
more salt and pepper, using in all one teaspoonful salt and one-half tea- 
spoonful pepper. Cover with water, let simmer for half an hour. Let 
the milk come to a scald, put a pinch of soda into the chowder and stir; 
add the hot milk to the butter and flour; stir smootjh; then add to the 
chowder; let get very hot, and serve. 

Milk Soup. — The various soups known as creams are usually about 
half milk and half meat or vegetable stock, slightly thickened with flour 
which has been blended with fat. For example, the tough, flabby portions 
and white leaves of a bunch of celery might be cut in small pieces, mixed 
with a sliced onion, covered with cold water and cooked until much of it 
can be rubbed through a strainer. To this juice and pulp is added an 
equal portion or even more of hot milk. For thickening a quart of soup 
slightly, one ounce of butter and one rounding tablespoonful of flour 
should be cooked together in a small saucepan until frothing, then add a 
little of the soup and beat until smooth, and then mix with the whole 
Season with salt and pepper. For a thicker soup use twice as much 
flour and butter, though the butter may be decreased slightly. However, 
if we use skim-milk for the soup, as we may, the increase of butter is 



10 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

desirable. Such soitps can be made from almost any vegetable, varying 
the thickening according to the thickness of the pulp of the vegetables. 
Bean and pea soup require less flour, but a little will keep them from 
becoming watery on top. A corn chowder can be made much like a 
fish chowder from fresh or canned corn with pork fat, onion and po- 
tato. Such soups are excellent for suppej on a cold night, and give an 
opportunity to turn skim-milk to good account. 

Mock Oy.5ter Soup. — Scrape a dozen roots of salsify, throwing at once 
into cold water to avoid discoloring, cut into thin slices and cover with 
a quart of water, or preferably soup stock. Cook gently until perfectly 
tender (about an hour) ; then add a quart of milk, a teaspoonful of salt, 
one-fourth teaspoonful of pepper, and two tablespoonfuls of butter cut 
into bits. Serve with oyster crackers. 

Italian Onion Soup. — Boil six young but fully grown onions in two 
waters, turning off the first at the end of 10 minutes' boil, and replac- 
ing with fresh hot water. There should be a quart of the second water. 
When the onions are tender, add a cupful of dry, fine bread crumbs and 
cook gently for five minutes more. Pour the contents of the kettle into 
a colander and rub the onions and crumbs through it into the liquid in 
the bowl below. Return all to the fire, simmer for a minute and stir into 
the soup a "roux," made by heating to a bubbling cream a great spoon- 
ful of butter with one of flour in a frying pan. Have ready heated in 
another saucepan a cup of milk in which you have dropped a pinch of 
soda. Take the boiling soup from the fire, stir in the hot milk, and pour 
into a heated tureen. Pass Parmesan cheese with it. 

Cream of Oyster Soup. — ^Add to one quart of milk half of a small 
onion, two sprigs of parsley and a half a cupful of celery leaves and 
stalks. Scald in a double boiler. Mix one-fourth of a cupful of flour 
with sufficient cold milk to make a paste and add it to the scalded milk. 
Stir until it thickens and let cook for about 20 minutes covered. Pour 
a cupful of cold water over a quart of oysters, strain the liquid through 
a cheesecloth and heat to a boiling point. Add the oysters and when the 
boiling point is reached add the thickened milk. Season with salt and 
white pepper and stir in; little by little, one-fourth of a cup of butter. 

Pink Velvet Soup.— Half a canful of tomatoes, one pint of water, 
one tablespoonful of butter, one large onion, chopped small; one potato 
shaved thin, a saltspoonful of celery seed, a teaspoonful of salt, a table- 
spoonful of sugar and a pinch of sweet marjoram. Boil all together 
for half an hour, or until the potatoes melt. Strain, thicken with gran- 
ulated tapioca or cornstarch, boil five minutes, add a pinch of baking soda, 
and then pour in a pint of hot milk. Serve at once. 

Potato Soup.— Three potatoes, one pint milk, one teaspoonful chopped 
onions, one stalk celery, one teaspoonful salt, one teaspoonful celery salt 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 11 

one-half saltspoonful white pepper, one-fourth saltspoonful cayenne, one- 
half tablespoonful flour, one tablespoonful butter. Pare the potatoes 
and soak them in cold water one-half hour. Boil them until very soft. 
Cook onions and celery in milk in double boiler. When potatoes are 
soft drain and mash, add boiling milk and seasoning. Rub through 
strainer and put on to boil again. Melt butter in small saucepan ; when 
bubbling add flour; when well mixed stir into boiling soup. Boil five 
minutes and serve very hot. This flour thickening prevents milk and 
potato from separating, and gives a smoothness quite unlike granular 
effects often noticed. If too thick add hot milk. The soup may also be 
made with meat stock instead of milk. 

Salmon Bisque. — One pint of oyster liquor and one of hot water 
heated together. When it boils stir in two cupfuls of finely minced 
salmon, seasoning with pepper, salt and a little chopped parsley. In an- 
other saucepan put one cupful of milk and heat to scalding, with a pinch 
of soda; stir into this two tablespoonfuls of butter, rubbed with one 
tablespoonful of flour and a half cupful of pounded cracker. Add one 
egg well beaten and stir and cook for a moment. Mix the fish and 
milk mixtures, cook a few moments, pour into soup tureen and serve 
hot. 

Scotch Broth. — One-half cup pearl barley, two pounds neck of mutton, 
two quarts cold water, one-fourth cup each of turnip, carrot, onion and 
celery chopped small, two tablespoons butter, one tablespoon flour, two 
teaspoonfuls salt, one saltspoon parsley chopped fine. Soak barley over 
night. Remove fat and skin from mutton, scrape meat from bones and 
cut in dice. Put bones on to boil in one pint cold water, the meat in 
separate pot with three pints water. Let the latter cook quickly. Skim 
when it begins to boil; add barley; skim again. Fry the chopped vege- 
tables in the hot butter five minutes, drain, add to the meat, simmer 
three hours. Strain the water in which the bones were simmered, set 
aside for a moment. Put in the saucepan the butter left from frying 
the vegetables, melt and add the flour. When smooth, pour in gradually 
the liquid from the bones. Add to the broth, add salt, parsley and one- 
half saltspoon pepper, simmer 10 minutes and serve. As this broth is 
served without straining it is always well to boil bones separately. 

Split Pea Soup. — Wash a pint of split peas and cover with tepid 
water, adding a pinch of soda, and let remain over night to swell. In 
the morning put them in a kettle with three quarts of cold water, adding 
half a pound of lean salt pork cut into slices, also a teaspoonful of salt 
and a little pepper. Cook slowly for three hours, stirring occasionally 
till the peas are all dissolved, adding a little more boiling water to keep 
up the quantity as it boils away. Strain through a colander. Serve with 
small squares of toasted bread. 



13 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Squirrel Soup.— Allow one large or two small squirrels, well washed 
and jointed, to two quarts of cold water and two teaspoonfuls (level) 
of salt. Put to cook directly after breakfast in a stone pipkin or enam- 
eled kettle. Cover closely and set on the back of the range to simmer— 
not boil. After two hours add the corn from two ears, two small Irish 
potatoes, one-half cupful of Lima beans, three sprigs of parsley, three 
celery stalks and one-half cupful of sliced okra. Keep closely covered, 
and as the water evaporates add enough to keep the original two quarts. 
When the squirrels have cooked to rags strain through a coarse colander 
to. remove the troublesome little bones. Return to. the soup kettle, cover 
and continue to simmer until nearly time to serve. Then thicken with 
a dessertspoonful of butter rolled in a dessertspoonful of ilour. Those 
who like may add a teaspoonful of powdered sassafras leaves. Have two 
slices of toast cut into inch squares, fried in butter and placed in the 
bottom of a hot tureen. Pour over them the soup, boiling hot, and 
serve immediately. 

Puree of Tomatoes. — Cook the contents of a can of tomatoes for 15 
minutes, then rub through a colander. Return to the fire and season with 
salt and pepper to taste, and a little sugar. Rub three tablespoonfuls of 
butter into one tablespoonful of cornstarch, and stir this smooth paste 
into the strained tomatoes. Cook, stirring steadijy, until smooth and 
thick. Have ready heated in a saucepan a quart of rich milk into which 
has been stirred a pinch of baking soda. To this add, gradually, the 
thickened tomato liquor, beating the milk constantly as you do so. 
Serve immediately, putting a great spoonful of unsweetened whipped 
cream on the surface of each plate of soup. 

Vegetable Cream Soups. — Scald three cupfuls of milk. Rub together 
one tablespoonful of butter and two tablespoonfuls of flour, cook until 
it bubbles; add the hot milk gradually to this, and cook for five minutes, 
stirring until thick and smooth. Blend some of this cream with a cup- 
ful of cooked vegetable, mashed to a smooth pulp, mix all together, and 
simmer for five minutes, seasoning appropriately. Potato soup should 
have a little celery and onion cooked in the milk, and when ready to 
serve some finely-chopped parsley should be scattered on top. Celery, 
asparagus, green peas or beans, carrots, spinach, cucumbers and lettuce 
are all good in such soup; all must first be cooked and reduced to a 
smooth pulp. Bread cut into dice and browned in butter is often added 
when the soup is ready to serve. 



CHAPTER ir. 



FISH. 



All small fish are best fried, and many large fish are excellent cooked 
in the same way. The fish should be well cleaned; if small left whole, 
if large cut into neat pieces. Beat an egg with a tablespoonful of cold 
water; dip the fish in this, then roll in bread crumbs or cornmeal. Cook 
in plenty of fat, which must be boiling hot when put in. Baking and 
boiling are both excellent methods of cooking fish, but very soft fish 
should never be boiled. The recipes given below refer mainly to canned 
and salt fish, because these are more helpful in an emergency. 

Clam Chowder. — ^Take the liquor from fifty clams, put it on the stove 
to heat. Cut into dice % pound salt pork, brown it in the frying pan, 
and add to the clam liquor. Peel and cut into dice three quarts of ripe 
tomatoes and half the quantity of potatoes. Cut up 50 clams, and let all 
the ingredients boil slowly for two or three hours. Half hour before 
serving add half a dozen large crackers rolled fine. 

Clam Gumbo. — In one large tablespoonful of lard fry one finely- 
chopped onion, add one cupful of chopped cooked ham, one tablespoonful 
of chopped green pepper, four tomatoes, skinned and cut in pieces, one 
pint of okra, stemmed and sliced, one scant teaspoonful of salt and one 
quart of water or broth. Simmer for an hour, add one dozen finely 
chopped clams, sirmner 15 minutes, and serve. 

Clam Pie. — From a half pound of rather fat salt pork trim off the 
rind and cut in slices, then in dice. Slowly fry this, and when the fat 
is well drawn out and just beginning to color add half of a small onion 
cut fine. When golden brown add one quart of raw, diced potatoes, 
one pint of boiling water and one-quarter of a teaspoonful of black pep- 
per. Cover and cook slowly until the potatoes are almost tender. Take 
from the fire, add one solid pint of raw clams cut in quarters and theii- 
strained juice. Turn into a deep well-greased baking dish. While this 
mixture is cooking mix and sift together one pint and a half of flour, 
a .half teaspoonful of salt and two teaspoonfuls of baking powder. 
Mix to a soft dough with sweet milk, and roll out not over a half inch 
thick. Cut in small round biscuits. Place these close together over the 
tap of the pie, brush with milk and bake in a hot oven for 35 minutes. 

Roast Qams. — Wash the clams and drain them in a colander for a 
few minutes, tlien lay them in a large dripping pan and put the pan into 
a very hot oven. As soon as the shells begin to open, the clams are 



14 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

cooked; it takes from seven to 10 minutes to roast them. Have a cov- 
ered dish hot, and drop the clams into it as soon as they are taken from 
the shell. Spread over them a mustard cream sauce and serve at once. 
To make the sauce: Put one cup of milk over the fire in a double 
boiler. When boiling, gradually stir into it three tablespoonfuls of but- 
ter, one of flour, and one leaspoonful of dry mustard that have been 
beaten to a creamy mass. Season with salt and pepper and return to the 
fire; cook three minutes, and it is ready to serve. Thin slices of brown 
bread, buttered, are served with roast clams. 

Baked Fish. — Bluefish, cod, or haddock are the best fish to bake. 
Clean the fish and make a stuffing as follows : Soak stale bread in cold 
water for 20 minutes. Press dry, and season with one egg, one table- 
spoonful melted butter and a small quantity of sage, or the prepared 
poultry dressing, or a little onion juice, as preferred. When the stuf- 
fing has been thoroughly mixed, fill the fish and sew up with needle and 
thread. Flour the fish well and salt it. Lay a few thin slices of salt pork 
into the bottom of the baking dish, also a few slices on top of the 
fish. Baste it often with the liquor which cooks out of it, adding a lit- 
tle water if there is not enough. Allow 15 minutes to the pound for 
bakmg fish. Have a moderate oven, as, if very hot, it will not cook 
well in the middle. 

New England Codfish. — Select a whole fish, and put it to soak in 
cold water over night; in the morning wash it clean and cut off the fins 
and tail. Cook the fish whole; if you have not got a fish kettle place it 
in a large milk pan partly filled with water. Cover the pan closely and 
set over a kettle of hot water. It will cook very slowly in this way, say 
five or six hours, according to the size of the fish, but it will be done 
properly when ready for the table. Serve it whole, placing it on a hot 
platter. Indeed, one of the essentials of a good salt fish dinner is to 
have everything hot, not only the fish and vegetables, but plates and 
dishes as well. The dish on. which your fish is served must be an ample 
one, and around the fish you will place a garnish of nicely sliced beets 
and carrots. With the fish you will serve pork scraps and egg sauce 
and boiled potatoes. The pork should be cut into dice and fried a rich 
brown. To make the egg sauce, take two eggs that have been boiled 
10 minutes, remove the shell, and cut into little pieces, placing them in 
the sauce dish. Blend a piece of butter the size of an egg with a table- 
spoonful of flour, and when the fish is ready to serve, pour over a coffee- 
cupful of boiling water, stir, and pour into the sauce dish with the egg 
and stir again. If the sauce is too thick, add still more boiling water. 
When you have not time to cook a salt fish for dinner and desire an 
emergency dish, try salt fish in cream prepared as follows: Shred a 
cupful of salt cod, or, if you prefer, use the prepared article, place it in 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. IS 

a stewpan over the fire in cold water to cover, and let it come to a boil 
for a couple of minutes; pour off the water, add to the fish one pint 
of sweet milk, and when this boils thicken with flour wet with' milk; 
let it boil four or five minutes, being careful it does not scorch, and 
serve in a hot, deep dish. Serve pickled beets with this dish, and boiled 
potatoes. 

Cuban Codfish. — Pick into fine shreds a cupful of freshened codfish. 
Cut an onion into thin slices and lightly brown in a saucepan with a 
tablespoonful of butter. Add the fish and pour in just enough water 
to cover. Add a part of a chopped green pepper and a half can of to- 
matoes. Cover closely and simmer for an hour. If the tomatoes are 
very juicy, less water is required. Cream a rounded teaspoonful of but- 
ter and one of flour; stir into the fish until smooth and cooked; turn the 
mixture upon thin slices of buttered toast. 

Delicate Fishballs. — Boil the quantity of codfish that would be re- 
quired, changing the water once that it may not be too salt. While the 
fish is hot pick it very fine, so that it will be feathery. It cannot be done 
fine enough with a fork, and should be picked by hand. At the same 
time have hot boiled potatoes ready, mash them thoroughly and make 
them creamy with milk and a good-sized lump of butter. To three cup- 
fuls of mashed potatoes take lyi cupful of fish; the fish should not be 
packed down. Beat one egg lightly and stir into the other ingredients 
and season to taste. Beat the mixture well together and until light, then 
mold it into small balls, handling lightly and before frying roll the balls 
in flour. Fry them in smoking hot fat until a gold color. 

Mexican Codfish. — Fry to a pale yellow one small onion, chopped 
fine, in three tajjlespoonfuls of butter; add two tablespoonfuls of flour, 
half a green pepper, chopped fine, and one cupful of stewed and sifted 
tomato pulp. When the sauce reaches the boiling point, add half a 
pound of salt codfish, which has been freshened for 24 hours in cold 
water and slowly simmered until it will readily separate into flakes. 

Codfish Mound. — Make one quart of good mashed potatoes without 
any salt; add a pint of picked boiled codfish. Season with pepper; beat 
well together, make into a mound with a depression in center on a bak- 
ish dish, and set in the oven to brown. When brought to the table, pour 
a few tablespoonfuls of cream sauce in center of mound, and garnish 
with hard-boiled egg. Serve with boiled beets and, if desired, salt pork 
or bacon cut into tiny squares and fried crisp, which, with the fat fried 
out, is poured into a gravy bowl. This makes a hearty and satisfying 
meal. 

Biscay Salt Cod. — Bone two pounds of salt cod and soak in cold 
water for 13 hours. Place in a saucepan, cover with salt water and let 
heat gradually to boiling point; then add fresh water and let boil again. 



IG THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Take out and drain. Chop two onions and one green pepper quite fine 
and cook for five minutes in butter or oil. Add one sliced tomato or 
half-cupful of stewed tomatoes, one clove of garlic and a small chili 
pepper. Add to these three pints of broth, a small bunch of parsley, 
three tablespoonfuls of tomato catsup and a pint of small potatoes 
(peeled) or the same quantity of potato balls. Cook until the potatoes 
are just done, add the cod and cook five minutes longer. 

Salt Codfish Chowder.— Cut one-fourth pound of salt pork into bits 
and try out the fat in a frying pan; in this brown two medium-sized 
onions, sliced. Wash and drain a pound of codfish, cut or picked into 
bits; cover with cold water and set on back of range to heat, but not 
boil. After two hours add a pint and a half of potatoes pared and sliced, 
and a dash of pepper. Add a cupful of water to the onions and pork 
and strain over the potatoes. When the potatoes are tender add one 
cupful each of scalded cream and milk. Pour the chowder over six 
crackers broken into halves and serve. 

Finnan Haddie, Caledonian Style. — Soak one-half of a finnan haddie 
weighing four pounds, two hour's in milk and water to cover, using 
equal parts, having the . liquid at a uniformly even tepid temperature. 
This is best accomplished by having the fish in a drip pan on the back 
of the range. Trim the fish to fit a copper platter or graniteware drip- 
ping pan, by cutting off flank and a two-inch piece from the tail end. 
Pour over a cream sauce, and surround with six halves of potatoes of 
uniform size smoothly pared. Cook until the potatoes are soft, the time 
required being about 40 minutes, basting with the cream sauce three 
times during the cooking. Cream must enter into the composition of a 
real cream sauce. For the cream sauce for the finnan haddie, melt two 
tablespoonfuls of butter, add two tablespoonfuls of flour, and stir until 
well blended, then pour on gradually, while stirring constantly, one cupful 
of milk and one-half cupful of cream. Bring to the boiling point, and 
season with a few grains of pepper. No salt will be needed, for it must 
be remembered that finnan haddie is salted. 

Finnan Haddie in Cream. — Cover a pound of the fish with cold water 
and let come to a simmer, drain, then cut into moderate-sized pieces. In 
the meantime prepare a cream sauce made by melting a tablespoonful 
of butter to which is added a tablespoonful of flour, a scant saltspoonful 
of salt, a dash of cayenne, two teaspoonfuls of lemon juice and one-half 
cupful each of milk and cream. Add the pieces of fish, let the whole 
come to a boil and serve. This creamed fish is also very nice if put 
in a baking dish, covered with bread crumbs, and browned in the oven. 
Browned Salt Mackerel. — Freshen two fish by soaking over night, 
wash in fresh water in the morning and squeeze over the flesh side the 
juice of one-half a lemon. Lay one of the fish skin side down in baking 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 17 

dish and cover with dressing made of one cupful bread crumbs, one table- 
spoonful butter (scant), pinch of pepper, a little grated lemon peel and 
one-fourth cupful of cream. Lay the other fish on dressing, skin side up, 
and baste well with hot water and melted butter. Put into a hot oveh 
for 20 minutes, then cover with bread crumbs, dot with bits of butter 
and put back in the oven till nicely browned. Carefully dish without 
disturbing the layers and serve with thin lemon slices and parsley as a 
garnish. 

Oyster Chowder. — Fry together two ounces of' salt pork and one 
onion, sliced. Parboil one pint of sliced potatoes five minutes and drain. 
Look over carefully one pint of oysters, pour over one-half cupful of 
water and heat to the boiling point; skim out the oysters and pour the 
liquor over the potatoes, add the pork and onions and cook the potatoes 
until tender, adding a little more water if necessary; add the oysters, 
one pint of milk and one-half cupful of fine bread crumbs. Season with 
one teaspoonful of salt and half-teaspoonful of pepper and pour in the 
serving dish. 

Oyster Stew. — Put one quart of oysters in a colander, and pour over 
three-fourths of a cupful of cold water, reserving the liquor. Pick over 
the oysters, being careful that no particles of shells adhere to "the tough 
muscles. Heat the reserved liquor to the boiling point, strain through a 
double thickness of cheese cloth, add the oysters, and cook, stirring oc- 
casionally, until the oysters are plump and the edges begin to curl. Re- 
move the oysters with a skimmer to a heated tureen, and add one-fourth 
of a cupful of butter, one-half tablespoonful of salt, one-eighth of a 
teaspoonful of pepper, the oyster liquor, strained a second time through 
a double thickness of cheese cloth, and four cupfuls of scalded milk. 

Baked Pickerel. — Clean the fish carefully and lay on a rack in a 
dripping pan ; dredge with a teaspoonful of salt, several dashes of pepper, 
and a little flour. Bake carefully, basting every 10 minutes until well 
done, with hot water to which a tablespoonful of butter has been added. 
Make the .sauce with half a cup of cream and half a cup of the basting 
liquid in which the fish was cooked ; thicken with a teaspoonful of butter 
and a tablespoonful of flour; let the sauce boil up once, then add a ta- 
blespoonful of chopped parsley. Pour part of the sauce around the 
fish on a platter, and serve the remainder in a gravy boat. 

Quahaug Pie. — ^Remove the loose brown skin and black part from a 
quart of sea clams and chop the remainder fine. Scald a cup of milk, 
the liquid from the clams and enough water to make a pint in all, and 
thicken it with a tablespoonful each of flour and butter cooked to a 
smooth paste; then add pepper and salt to taste and two finely-chopped 
hard-boiled eggs, and lastly, the chopped clams. Line a meat pie dish 
with pie crust, then add a thin layer of cracker crumbs, the prepared

clams, and sprinkle this over with another layer of cracker crumbs and 
cover with a good, rich crust, leaving several openings so the steam 
can escape. Bake about an hour in a hot oven until well browned. 

Salmon Chowder.— Chop coarsely and brown together in a kettle or. 
saucepan, one-fourth pound of salt pork and one onion. Add one pint 
of raw potatoes, chopped or cut in dice, which have stood for half an 
hour in cold water. Season, barely cover with boiling water, and sim- 
mer for half an hour; then add a can of salmon, drained and flaked, 
two or three broken _ crackers and one pint of scalded milk or cream, 
with two teaspoons of butter. This may be varied by the addition of a 
can of tomatoes, or a shredded pepper or both. 

Creamed Salmon. — Put one tablespoonful of butter into a saucepan; 
when melted add one tablespoonful of flour, half a teaspoonful of salt, 
a dash of paprika and half a cup of milk. Cook until smooth, then add 
a small can of salmon finely minced, one tablespoonful lemon juice and 
a little grated nutmeg. Remove from the fire and add yolks of three 
eggs, well beaten; whip whites of the eggs stiff and fold in carefully. 
Butter small molds or a baking dish, place in hot water in a dripping 
pan and bake from 10 to S5 minutes. 

Escalloped Salmon. — Put one pint of milk to heat with a tablespoon- 
ful of butter. Moisten a tablespoonful of flour and stir in ; when thick 
like cream remove from fire. Drain the liquid from the salmon and 
remove borie, pick it all up into fine pieces with a fork. Butter a bak- 
ish dish, put in a layer of fine cracker crumbs, then half the salmon, an- 
other layer of cracker crumbs, and half the thickened milk. Then add 
the remaining salmon, a layer of crumbs and the remaining milk. Bake 
half an hour. 

Salmon Loaf. — One can of salmon drained and minced. Five table- 
spoonfuls of butter, four eggs well beaten; half cup of bread crumbs, 
salt and pepper to taste. Mix all together, and steam one hour in but- 
tered mold. ' 

Fried Smelts. — Do not have the heads removed when the marketman 
cleans the fish. Wipe the outside of each with a damp cloth and then 
roll in Indian meal, then in beaten egg and then again into the meal ; lay 
in a frying basket or place a few in a kettle of hot lard to cook until 
the coating is brown ; remove them and drain on to plain paper, and when 
serving arrange with garnishing of sliced lemon and parsley. If the 
basket is used place the fish side by side in it and drop into the kettle of 
hot lard until the fish are browned. 

Sportsman's Trout.— Take two fresh young trout, clean, wash and 
then wipe dry. Use one-half teaspoon of salt and two or three dashes 
of pepper over the fishes. Put in a pan to fit and fill to the level with 
cream. Bake a light brown, when the fish will have absorbed the cream. 



CHAPTER III. 

MEATS. 

I am the dinner table ; upon my ample breast 

Three times a day the housewife puts out her very best. 

Three times a day they gather — old grandpa at the head, 

Thrice daily offers up his thanks for life and daily bread. 

Then how the knives they clatter and how my load grows light, 

And how the housewife's goodly fare doth disappear from sight. 

I am the dinner table, and while my timbers stand 

I'll still remain headquarters for our good household band. 

Elaborate instructions for marketing are usually given under this head, 
but the farm housekeeper meets with different conditions. If meat is 
locally slaughtered it is likely to be much better in quality than that from 
the great packing centers. In pork particularly she has a great advantage 
over her town sisters. It should be remembered that in beef and mutton 
many of the cheaper and tougher cuts are nutritious and well flavored, 
but they need careful preparation, and especially long slow cooking. 
Tough meat should never be roasted, broiled or fried ; it should be cooked 
gently in a closed vessel, with such seasonings as will best develop flavor. 
There are still some cooks who prepare meat hastily in slightly thickened 
water, and then wonder why the family dislikes stews. With long, slow 
cooking in a casserole or closed vessel, and a proper admixture of herbs 
and seasoning, the humble stew becomes a delicious ragout. 

Bacon, Cold Roast. — Select a square piece weighing three or four 
pounds, soak it over night. The next morning put it on to boil; allowing 
it to simmer very gently three-quarters of an hour to the pound; then 
let it go cool in the water in which it was cooked. When cold drain, 
remove the skin, rub the fat well with sugar, pour over it some cider 
vinegar, and roast in the oven until brown. When cold cut into thin 
slices; it should be tender and delicate in flavor. 

Beef, Braised.-^Procure a piece of four pounds, make incisions in it 
an inch and a half apart, and stuff them with a dressing made of two 
tablespoonfuls of finely-minced onion, three tablespoonfuls of chopped 
parsley, a teaspoonful of sweet basil, a half teaspoonful of thyme, a half 
teaspoonful of pepper and two teaspoonfuls of salt. Dredge a table- 
spoonful of flour over the meat, lay three thin slices of bacon in the 
bottom of a deep pan, place the meat in, lay three more slices of bacon 
over the top, cover with a well-fitting lid and shut up in a moderate oven 
to brown. After it has been cooking for two hours add two carrots (or 
four small ones), one turnip, three stalks of celery, four salsifies and one 



20 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

onion, all sliced. Add also three tablespoonfuls of tomato catsup, one 
minced green pepper, a teaspoonful of salt. If no green pepper is at 
hand use a few shreds of red pepper pod. A cofieecupful of boiling water 
should be added with the vegetables. Fit the cover on closely again and 
leave in'the oven for another hour, or until both meat and vegetables are 
tender. To serve, place the meat on a hot platter and arrange the vege- 
tables by the spoonful about it; there should be just gravy enough to 
hold the vegetables together. 

Beef, Corned. — Here is an old home recipe for corning beef, which 
will be especially useful to those who kill their own beef cattle as well 
as pork. To every hundred pounds of beef take nine pounds of salt, four 
pounds of sugar or two quarts of good molasses, two ounces of soda, one 
ounce of saltpeter, and just enough water to cover the meat — about four 
or five gallons. Strew some salt over the bottom of a barrel ; mix about 
half the amount of salt given with half the given amount of sugar or 
molasses, and rub each piece of meat thoroughly with it before placing it 
in the barrel. Dissolve the saltpeter and soda together in hot water, add 
the remainder of the salt and sugar and about four or five gallons of 
cold water. Pour this over the meat. Place a board on top of the meat, 
with a weight heavy enough to keep it under the brine. It may be kept 
an indefinite time in the brine, but is salt enough to cook after five or 
six days' corning. 

Spiced corned beef is made as follows, the recipe being an old one, 
we think of German origin : Rub twelve pounds of a round of beef with 
half a pound of coarse sugar. Let it stand for two days, turning it two 
or three times. Take a large tcaspoonful of mace, a teaspoonful of black 
pepper, two of cloves, half a teaspoonful of cayenne, one small grated 
nutmeg, two ounces of juniper berries and one-half ounce of saltpeter. 
Stir all these seasonings together, adding a teaspoonful of sugar and rub 
the mixture thoroughly into the meat and all over it. Then let it stand 
for three days longer. At the end of this time rub half a pound of fine 
salt into the meat. Finally, let it stand for twelve days, rubbing the meat 
and turning it daily. If it is to be cooked immediately and not dried, wash 
it, but do not soak it. Lay it in a pot that just fits it, and pour over it a 
quart and a half of water. When it comes to the boiling point skim it 
carefully, add a carrot, a small onion, a bay leaf and a few sprigs of par- 
sley. Let it simmer very gently for four and a half hours. Take it from 
the fire, put it under a heavy weight and let it cool in the liquid in which 
it was cooked. Serve in thin slices when perfectly cold. 

Corned Beef, Shaker Style.— This recipe is given under the name of 
"bacca," in Good Housekeeping: Pound down close in a barrel 100 
pounds of the round of beef cut in lO-pound pieces, with a mixture of 
four pounds sugar, two ounces saltpeter, two ounces soda bicarbonate, and 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 21 

four quarts table salt sprinkled under, over and between. It will make 
brine without water. After one week, a piece of the top of the round, ' 
sliced and broiled, will be found tender and delicious. The bottom of 
the round, boiled till tender and sliced thin when cold, resembles ham, 
but is more choice in flavor. 

Corned Beef, Savory Style. — Choose a piece of brisket of corned beef 
weighing four to iive pounds and about three times as long as wide; 
wash, season with a small haif teaspoonful of pepper, then roll it up and 
tie very tight. Put the beef in a kettle with cold water to cover, and 
let slowly come to a boil, then pour it off and replace with more cold 
water to cover; add half a cupful of vinegar, a small onion, peeled, in 
which is inserted six cloves, half a red pepper, a blade of mace and a 
stalk of celery. Boil gently, allow half an hour to each pound. Serve hot. 
If the meat is preferred cold, it should be allowed to cool in the broth 
in which it was cooked. 

Curried Beef. — Melt in a saucepan two tablespoonfuls of butter, add 
two onions sliced, and fry until brown; then add two tablespoonfuls of 
curry powder. Cut cold roast beef in pieces about an inch square, put it 
in the saucepan and add half a cupful of sweet milk. Simmer for 30 
minutes. Just before serving add the juice of a lemon. Send to the 
table on a platter bordered with boiled rice. 

Beef Loaf. — Take two pounds of round steak and half a pound of 
suet, both chopped fine; add two eggs, one cupful of bread crumbs that 
have been softened in cold water, one small onion, chopped fine, one-half 
cupful of sweet milk 1^ teaspoonful of salt, and a fourth of a tea- 
spoonful of pepper; mix all together and shape into a loaf, put in a roast- 
ing pan and bake in a moderate oven 2^ hours, baste frequently; serve 
with tomato sauce. 

Beefsteak Chowder. — Cut a pound and one-half of round steak in strips 
or cubes. Cut three or four ounces of fat pork in small pieces and cook 
in a hot frying pan with an onion sliced very thin. When both are 
browned add a quart of boiling water, simmer five minutes, pour the 
whole over the steak, bring to the boiling point, boil for five minutes and 
then cook slowly until the meat is tender. Have ready five large potatoes 
peeled, sliced, scalded in boiling water, drained and rinsed in cold water. 
Add the potatoes, one teaspoonful of salt and saltspoonful of pepper. 
Cook until the potatoes are tender, then add one and one-half cupful of 
rich milk and a little more salt if necessary. Heat to the boiling point 
and pour over pilot biscuit or thick crackers which have been dipped for 
a second in hot water. 

English Beefsteak Pudding. — Make a crust by thoroughly mixing two 
cupfuls of finely-chopped beef suet in three cupfuls of flour; add half 
teaspoonful of salt, and mix with cold water into a dough with the con- 



22 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

sistency of biscuit. Roll out the paste to the thickness of half an inch. 
Butter an earthen pudding bowl, and line with the paste. Take flank or 
round steak, cut into one-inch pieces, season with pepper and salt, and 
fill- the dish. Pour in as much cold water as will find its way in around 
the meat, then cover it with paste, having moistened the edges to make 
them stick together. Cover with a cloth, well floured, leaving a little 
room for the pudding to swell. Put it into a pot of. boiling water, and 
let it boil three hours, or put it in a steamer, and allow four hours' 
cooking. When fully cooked the meat should be very tender, with an 
abundance of rich clotted gravy. The addition of a few oysters with 
the meat forms a palatable change. Serve with boiled carrots and turnips. 

Spiced Beef.— This makes a desirable cold dish for luncheon or tea, 
or for Sunday dinner in Summer. Select a piece of the flank, trim oS 
the coarse skin, lay it flat on the table, and, with a knife, spread over it 
the following mixture : One teaspoonful ground mustard, one teaspoonful 
celery salt, half teaspoonful black pepper, pinch of red pepper, mixed to 
a smooth paste with vinegar. Then roll up the meat like a jelly cake, the 
spice inside, tie it up, tie it in a cloth like a pudding. Put it into boiling 
water, and let it boil 2^2 hours. When cooked lift the kettle off the 
stove, and allow the water to cool before removing the meat. Do not 
take the cloth off until cold, then slice the meat for serving. 

Waverly Collared Beef. — Corn a six-pound piece of the thick part of 
the brisket by putting it in brine strong enough to float an egg, to which 
is added a heaping teaspoonful of saltpeter, one of brown sugar and a 
saltspoon of red pepper. Leave it in five or six days in Summer; eight 
or 10 in Winter. Use an earthen crock, and turn the meat every two or 
three days. Grate two large carrots, a good-sized stick of horseradish, 
and chop fine a large bunch of parsley; mix all together, and spread a 
thick layer on the corned beef, keeping it well to the middle, as it presses 
out when you roll; if the meat is not long, and difficult to roll nicely, cut 
a few pockets in it and fill with the dressing; then roll very tightly, 
fastening with skewers and bmding with strong string round and round. 
Any of the dressing that has squeezed out press back into the open ends 
of the roll ; remove the skewers ; then tie up in ' cheesecloth, cover with 
cold water, bring slowly to a simmer, and let it cook at this point four 
hours. Remove the cheesecloth, put the meat on a tray, place a heavy 
weight on it and leave it over night. Cut off the string. Serve cold, 
cutting thin slices off the end, showing the dressing. 

Brown Stew. — A piece of tough steak can be very well cooked in this 
way: Browri a tablespoonful of sugar in the kettle and add a sliced 
onion; when brown cool and add for each pound of beef cut in small bits 
s tablespoonful of flour and one of butter or suet. Add a pint of boiling 
water, stir well and add the bits of meat. Put in half of a bay leaf or a 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 23 

pinch of celery seed. Cook very slowly for an hour. Just before serving 
add a teaspoonful of salt. The meat will be tender, the flavor excellent. 
The browned sugar, or caramel, as cooks call it, does not give a percep- 
tibly sweet flavor, but gives s different taste, and makes brown gravy. 

Brunswick Stew.— Stew a large fowl until the meat leaves the bone; 
remove skin, gristle and bones and chop the meat in coarse pieces. Return 
to the liquor; add a pint of corn scraped from the ears, a pint of young 
Lima beans, three cupfuls of tomato, a good-sized onion, minced fine, a 
pint of young okras, a small red pepper, minced, a little celery seed, two 
tablespoonfuls of butter and salt, pepper and Worcestershire sauce to 
taste. Simmer until okra is tender and then serve. The addition of ■^ 
little paprika just before the stew is taken up improves it greatly. 

Belgian Hare. — If you broil see that the hares are young, under four 
or five months, and therefore tender. After a brief soaking in water into 
which no soda or salt has been put (if the hares are young they have 
no unpalatable flavor and consequently great care must be taken to pre- 
serve their natural delicacy), dry well with a clean cloth, and gash them 
down the back through the thickest portion; then flatten each, place it 
on a gridiron, and broil it over a bed of coals, turning often, or you may 
lay them smooth on the bottom of a dripping pan and cook in a hot 
oven without basting; oil the pan slightly with a little sweet dripping, 
or a bit of fresh butter; they should be done in half an hour. 

Stewed. — Cut the hares into joints, drop into a pot and cover with 
boiling water; then slice in an onion and a bit of bacon, and stew slowly 
one hour or until tender. As old hares are best stewed, it will do no 
harm to put in a young chicken, stewing all together. At the end of 
half an hour add a few potatoes, peeled, and cut in quarters, and, if liked, 
some small bits of light paste, after the potatoes get fairly boiling. When 
all are done, stir in a little cream thickened with white flour, boil up a 
moment and dish for the table. 

Fried. — Disjoint, cut uniform pieces, cover with boiling water, and 
Jet it simmer until quite tender. Then remove carefully to a dry dish. 
Dredge well with flour, and drop into very hot butter to browa Serve 
with gravy made from the liquor in which it was boiled and cream. Two 
tablespoonfuls of vinegar added while boiling are an improvement. 

Roast Hare. — Make a dressing of fine dry bread crumbs; part graham 
is best Add to the crumbs a small lump of fresh butter, a little dry 
sage (or other herb, if preferred), and moisten well with tepid water, 
stirring well as you add it. Do not put in too much water; have the 
dressing light and flaky, not wet and heavy. The large and delicious 
liver of the hare, having been thoroughly steamed will add an unwonted 
zest if chopped into bits and put into the stuffing. Fill the hares with 
this, leaving plenty of room for the dressing to swell, sew up, put the 



24 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 



hares into a dripping pan, add a cupful of boiling water, and roast as 
slowly as possible during the first half hour. Baste every 15 or 20 min- 
utes, turning as needed, and if any part browns too fast, cover it with a 
clean napkin wet in warm water and folded two or three times. Allow 
from one to two hours for roasting; test with a fork to ascertain when 
the hares are done; take them out of the pan and make the gravy, drain 
the grease all off and set the pan on the stove; then put in any tid-bits 
(as the liver, etc.), and the liquor in which they are boiled; thicken with 
a little browned flour wet with milk or water, and boil up a moment. 

Canning Meat. — Half cook the meat in a kettle, cut meat from the 
benes. If this is done while the meat is hot, wring out a cloth from 
cold or tepid water, fold in several thicknesses, and set under the glass 
can, letting cloth come up about an inch around sides of can, and it will 
not break, no matter how hot the meat may be. If you spill more broth 
on the cloth be sure to wring out extra water from it, for if the cloth 
is sopping wet, the can will break. Having filled can with meat, pour in 
all the broth the can will hold, and see that it is salted and peppered 
just right for the table. Screw on cover without rubber. and, if hot put in 
kettle partly filled with hot water, putting a tin in bottom of kettle to 
set cans on. Three quarts can be put in common-sized kettle. Cover 
with a well-fitting cover that will keep in the steam, and keep boiling for 
two hours. Take out one can at a time, and at once put on a good rubber. 
If you want to keep the meat for several months, if it is chicken, veal or 
beef, have hot melted beef suet and fill the cans even full. If you only 
care to keep the meat for two or three weeks fill up even full with boiling 
broth. This work must be done with dispatch, not letting the contents 
of the can cool in the least. Screw on the cover to the last limit, arid 
if your covers and rubbers are not defective your meat will keep per- 
fectly. In canning pork there is nearly always sufficient grease to broth; 
if not the can may be filled with lard. 

Canning Meat in Tins. — ^Trim off all surplus tallow from meat, and 
eitlief boil or roast the beef, using but little salt and pepper, preferably 
none at all, as these will attack the tin; meat can be spiced, etc., when 
removed from can to serve. When cooked remove from liquid and trim 
off from bones. If liquid is too greasy let it get cold and then remove 
tallow. While again heating liquid and meat boiling hot get the cans and 
covers ready, the covers to be' pierced by an awl in the center. Use the 
friction top tin can only, for keeping meat through the Summer and dog 
days. You can use glass jars to keep same till May, but they are risky 
during warm weather. When meat and liquid are hot pack meat into the 
cans— any size you wish— not quite full, and pour liquid over same so as 
to cover meat somewhat, then place on the covers good and tight. Put 
cans into oven and bake one to two hours. If cans are too full, liquid 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 25 

will ooze through vent. The baking will drive out every particle of atom 
of air through vent, and is absolutely necessary for safety. When nearly 
done baking liquefy some paraffin or sealing wax, and heat a soldering 
iron. The paraffin is to seal cover airtight around edge, and the soldering 
iron to use with solder to close up vent opening in center. Take out of 
oven a can at a time and solder vent opening as quickly as possible, then 
paraffin the edge of cover. Place cans — after finishing job — where it is 
dry and cool. A steer can be packed into about 50 or 60 quart cans. 

Chicken Baked in Milk. — Dress and joint a chicken of four to six 
pounds, dust each piece with salt and pepper, and roll in flour. Put the 
chicken in a roasting pan or casserole that it will half fill, then pour over 
it enough sweet milk to cover the chicken completely. Put a close-fitting 
iid on the baker, and put it in the oven, cooking the chicken until tender; 
it will take from two to ZYz hours. This requires but little attention while 
cooking, the meat is tender and juicy, and the gravy delicious. It is an 
excellent way to cook an elderly fowl; a young bird will, of course, cook 
in a shorter time. As it really gains in flavor by being warmed over, it 
can be cooked on Saturday for the Sunday dinner, thus lessening work. 

Broiled Chicken. — Take broilers of suitable age or size, dress in the 
usual way, split down the back and remove breast bone, which can be 
easily done by running finger along it. Place right side up in dripping 
pan, season with plenty of butter, pepper and salt ; put in a hot oven 
for 20 minutes to "draw" or heat well through. Take out; if cooking 
with gas turn, and put under flame a few minutes to brown; then brown 
the top, but do not burn. If cooking on stove with fuel proceed the same 
way on toaster or gridiron. 

Broiled Chicken, O. W. Mapes's Recipe.— The first essential of course 
is to have a nice fat chicken. This should be split through the back and 
laid in a shallow basin. Now place the basin containing the chicken in a 
steamer and steam for an hour and a half. The basin will catch all the 
juices which drip from the meat. These should all be saved and used in 
making the gravy. As soon as it is steamed sufficiently place in a well- 
buttered pan and fry until well browned; remove the meat and add the 
juices from steaming to make a good gravy. This method never has 
failed to bring satisfaction to both cook and guests. Possibly it would 
be equally as good with older birds by allowing more time in the steaming. 

Spring Chicken Fried in Cream.— Put a pint of rich cream in a frying 
pan over a moderate fire till it begins to color, dip the different parts of 
the chicken in flour, fry in the cream on each side till it is a delicate brown.. 
When done put it on a hot platter, pour another half pint of cream into 
the pan, let it boil one minute, add a saltspoonful of salt, a dash of 
pepper, then pour it over the chicken. Serve garnished with sprigs of 
parsley and a dish of puffed potato slices. 



26 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 



Jugged Chicken.— Cut the bird up as for a fricassee. To every pound 
allow two heaping teaspoonfuls of flour, one scant teaspoonful of salt 
and one-quarter teaspoonful of pepper; mix thoroughly and roll each 
piece of chicken in the mixture, then pack closely in a large bean-pot; 
cover with boiling water and bake in a good oven until tender— from two 
to three hours. When placed in the pot sprinkle in a tablespoonful of 
minced onion. When done remove to a hot platter, thicken the liquor 
for gravy and serve in a boat. 

Chicken Loaf.— Mince fine two cupfuls of cold cooked chicken, one 
pound of lean veal and one-fourth pound of fat salt pork. Work in these 
three beaten eggs, a cupful of seasoned and strained tomato sauce, one 
teaspoonful of grated lemon peel, one teaspoonful of salt, one-fourth 
teaspoonful of paprika and enough cracker crumbs to mold with the hands. 
Press firmly into a large wet bowl, invert carefully into a buttered baking 
pan, removing bowl. Add one cupful of water and one tablespoonful of 
butter to the pan. Sift buttered crumbs lightly over the loaf and cover 
the top and sides with carefully peeled and sliced lemons. Bake 1J4 
hour in a moderate oven, browning it nicely before serving. Baste fre- 
quently with the liquor. Serve garnished with lemon slices and parsley. 

Paprika Chicken.— This is a favorite Hungarian dish. Cut a nice 
tender chicken into pieces as for a fricassee; flatten a little, such pieces 
as need it. Season each piece with salt and pepper, and dredge it lightly 
with flour, while you fry a minced onion in two tablespoonfuls of butter. 
Lay the chicken in the butter and onion, cooking for 20 minutes, so it will 
be evenly and thoroughly done. Take up the chicken and stir in an even 
teaspoonful of salt and a very scant teaspoonful of paprika, or half a 
scant teaspoonful of good mild cayenne pepper of any kind. Add last 
of all a cupful of rich cream. Make some dumplings of a pint of sifted 
flour, two teaspoonfuls of baking powder, a saltspoonful of salt and 
butter the size of half an egg; moisten the dumplings with a cupful of 
milk, and drop them over the sauce. Let them cook well, covered for 
50 minutes, when they will be well puffed up and light. Pour the sauce 
around the chicken and make a circle of the dumplings. If the dumplings 
are steamed over the cream sauce so they do not sink into it they will 
be lighter. 

Panned Fowl with Oysters. — Cut the fowl into pieces suitable for 
serving; lay them in a baking dish, flesh side down; season with a tea- 
spoonful of salt, a fourth of a teaspoonful of pepper and cover with thin 
slices of salt pork. Put one cupful of boiling water in the pan, cover 
closely and bake in a hot oven half an hour (for young chickens). Remove 
the cover and baste every 10 minutes for another half hour, turning the 
pieces so they will brown. Remove to a hot platter, add half a cupful of 
rich milk or cream to the gravy in the pan, first skimming off all fat; 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 37 

place on the top of the range and. stir in a tablespoonful of flour and same 
of butter blended together; when it boils add a cupful of well-washed 
(and cleaned from shells) oysters; watch carefully and as soon as the 
oysters are plump remove them from the fire; add a teaspoonful of 
finely-chopped parsley and a tablespoonful of lemon juice. Pour around 
the fowl; garnish with celery tips. An old fowl will require longer 
cooking. 

Chicken Pie, Southern Style. — Select a fowl weighing four or five 
pounds; clean carefully, singe and put it on in boiling water enough to 
cover it, and let it simmer gently until it begins to grow tender. Save 
this broth with the giblets. Now cut the chicken in small pieces; slice a 
quarter of a pound of fat pork very thin and fry it with the chicken 
until it is brown. After the chicken and pork are fried take them up 
and stir into the pan in which they were cooked a tablespoonful of flour. 
Stir it over the fire until brown; then add a pint of the chicken broth, a 
teaspoonful of salt, quarter of a teaspoonful of pepper. Stir this gravy 
until it has boiled two minutes and use it for pie. To make the crust : 
Mix together in a bowl with a knife one pound of flour, one teaspoonful 
of salt, two teaspoonfuls of butter, and just enough cold water to hold 
it together. Roll it out about an inch thick; cut a quarter of a pound 
of butter in large slices, and lay it all over the paste ; fold it up and 
wrap in a floured towel and put in the ice box for half an hour-. Roll 
it out, repeating same with another .quarter of a pound of butter; roll it 
to a thickness of half an inch, fold it in three thicknesses and roll it out 
again. If the butter breaks through, fold it again in a towel and cool for 
half an hour before using. Line a deep dish ; then put in alternate layers 
of chicken, pork and sliced raw potatoes ; pour in as much gravy as the 
dish will hold. Sprinkle with a little chopped parsley, a dash more pepper 
and salt, and cover with a top crust, wetting the edges to make them 
adhere. Cut a hole in the top to allow the steam to escape. 

Chicken Potpie with Stirred Dumplings. — Cut up the fowl for serving, 
wash, put in a deep stewpan, and add three pints of boiling water, salt, 
pepper and a bay leaf. Cook one large onion, and about three slices each 
of turnip and carrot, in a tablespoonful of butter, and cook till so/t; 
mash and add to stew; then dip out two tablespoonfuls of the fat from 
the stew, put with the butter, and when boiling stir in three tablespoonfuls 
of flour. Stir over the fire till brown, then stir into the chicken to 
thicken it. A year-old chicken will need two hours' cooking; it should 
only simmer, without hard boiling. For dumplings, into a quart of wheat 
flour sift two heaping teaspoonfuls of baking powder and a half tea- 
spoonful of salt. Sift at least three times. Then stir in rich, sweet milk 
to make a batter, not thick as can be stirred nor yet soft enough to run. 
Drop in spoonfuls over the top of the boiling potpie a half hour before 



28 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

dinner time. Should there be so much gravy that the batter would sink 
beneath its surface remove a bowlful. Cover closely and keep constantly 
boiling. Serve the dinner on a large meat platter, arranging the dumplings 
about its border, heaping the meat and potatoes in the center and serving 
the gravy from a gravy boat. In taking up the dumplings tear them apart 
with two forks in.stead of using a knife or spoon. 

Smothered Chicken. — Have a year-old chicken split as for broiling. 
Wipe dry, spread it liberally with butter all over, dust with flour and 
pepper, and place, skin side down, in a dripping pan (over a meat rack). 
Pour in a cupful boiling water, add a few sprigs of parsley, cover closely 
and bake in a hot oven one hour. Then turn the chicken skin side up, 
sprinkle with a half teaspoonful of salt, and brown uncovered, 10 or 15 
minutes. Cut up the giblets, which have been cooked tender in one pint 
of water, add a level dessertspoonful flour and a lump of butter the size 
of an egg with the water from the giblets, which will be reduced to about 
a cupful, and stir all in the dripping pan, seasoning with a saltspoonful 
of salt, a good dash of pepper, parsley or sweet marjoram. Joint the. 
chicken that it may be easily carved, but do not separate it. Serve on a 
platter with the gravy poured around. 

Victoria Chicken. — Procure a young chicken of three and one-half 
pounds. in weight, singe, draw and wash it, cut the chicken into 10 pieces, 
season with half teaspoonful pepper, and half tablespoonful of salt; rub 
the seasoning and the chicken well together. Cut half pound bacon into 
slices, remove the rind and place the bacon in a pan of boiling water, let 
it lie five minutes, then drain. Put the bacon into a saucepan and fry to 
a delicate brown, then take out the bacon. Put the chicken into the bacon 
fat, add half tablespoonful butter, cover and cook slowly for 30 minutes, 
turning the chicken with a fork three times during that time, then lay 
the chicken in a round pan with the slices of bacon between, pour over 
three cups of cream, cover the pan and bake one hour in a medium-hot 
oven. When ready to serve lay the chicken on a hot dish, and lay six 
bread croutons in a circle around the dish, strain the sauce over the 
chicken and serve. 

Deviled Mutton. — This is a nice way to warm up cold roast mutton 6r 
lamb. Put one teaspoonful of chopped onion into a stewpan with one 
ounce of butter. Place it over a slow fire, keep the onions stirred until 
rather brown, then add some flour, mix it in well and fry for five min- 
utes; then pour in one-half pint of gravy well seasoned, and let it boil 
until thickened and brown; add one teaspoonful of sugar and one of 
vinegar, one of Worcestershire sauce, a few chopped gherkins and a few 
button mushrooms if at hand; put in the mutton, which has been pre- 
viously sliced in thin slices and perfectly free from fat; let it remain a 
few minutes and simmer, not boil. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 29 

Flank Steak, Rolled. — Spread a steak weighing about 3J4 pounds with 
a dressing composed of l^^ cupful bread crumbs — dip the crusts previously 
in boiling water that they may easily crumble — one medium-sized onion, 
two tablespoonfuls canned tomato, one beaten egg, one tablespoonful 
butter, one teaspoonful salt, one-quarter teaspooriful pepper. Stir egg 
with bread, add the onion sliced, tomato, butter and seasoning. After 
spreading roll snugly and tie with pieces of string. Lay three slices of 
salt pork on top, place in dripping pan with one-half cupful water. Roast 
slowly one hour. May be eaten hot with gravy, or cold. 

Goulash. — Cut two leeks or onions, small-sized ones, into fine pieces, 
and fry them in hot butter till they are brown. Add one cupful of beef 
broth, a little salt, half a teaspoonful of paprika or red pepper, and 
half a teaspoonful of browned flour. Stir until smooth, then strain. 
Have ready one-half pound of raw steak, cut into quarter-inch squares. 
The better the steak, necessarily, the better tEe result will be, and there- 
fore porterhouse is preferred. Toss the meat into a frying pan just long 
enough to cook the outside, then add the sauce. Add two warm boiled 
potatoes, cut into good-sized pieces, and let the pan remain on the back 
of the stove 15 minutes before serving. 

Goose, Braised. — Braised goose is superior to a roast, in the taste of 
many, the bird acquiring flavor from the vegetables with it. The oven 
is the place for the cooking, and a porcelain-lined iron pot or earthen 
cooking crock (either having a tight-fitting cover) gives the best results. 
Prepare the goose as for roasting, but do not stuff. In the baking dish 
put a layer of chopped or sliced onions, celery, turnips, carrots and two 
apples. Sprinkle with a teaspoonful of salt, one of -powdered sage and 
six shakes of pepper. Lay the goose upon them, pour over it two cupfuls 
of boiling water, dredge with salt, pepper, powdered sage and flour. Cover 
closely and cook slowly for at least four hours (allow 25 minutes to the 
pound). Turn the goose every two hours. Add more water if necessary. 
Less time is required if a roaster is used. When tender, remove the 
goose. Rub the vegetables and gravy through a colander, return to the 
fire and stir in a table.spoonful of browned flour. Boil up once and serve 
in a boat. Garnish the goose with parsley. 

Gumbo. — This takes four hours to make. Put into a kettle two pounds 
of lean soup beef, one-half a chicken that has been jointed, a small ham 
bone, or a good-sized slice of lean bacon, a slice of green pepper and a 
square inch of onion. Add three quarts of water and boil or simmer 
gently, skimming often for two hours. At the end of this time add three 
pints of okra that has first been cut in slices and fried lightly in a very 
small amount of butter, also a large potato cut in pieces, which gradually 
breaks and thickens the soup. An hour later, after frequent skimmings, 
add a full quart of tomatoes and the corn cut from two large ears, also 



30 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

the cobs, and boil gently for another hour. Then remove the corncobs 
and what is left of the beef, and the chicken bones, leaving the chicken 
meat in the stew; season with salt, cayenne pepper, a teaspoonful of 
Worcestershire sauce and a teaspoonful of sugar, and it is ready to serve. 
Dry boiled rice is nice served with this gumbo, which is a stew rather 
than a soup. Many recipes for gumbo call for a small quantity of "fillet 
powder"; this is the tender young green leaves of sassafras powdered. 

Ham, Curing.— This is a Virginia method. For curing four hams, 
averaging 13 pounds each, have ready one and a half gallons of the best 
salt, one pound of good brown sugar, one-eighth pound of powdered 
saltpeter, one ounce of black pepper and one-half ounce of cayenne. Cut 
the joints into proper shapes, without unnecessary bone and fat, and lay 
them on a board on table. First rub the skin we'll with salt and lay 
each joint aside, then begin over again, and into the fleshy side of. each 
ham rub two teaspoonfuls of saltpeter and a tablespoonful of brown 
sugar mixed together. Rub the pepper, particularly, about the hock and 
under the bone and give to the whole ham a good application of salt. 
Now pack the hams, one upon another, the skin side downward, with a 
layer of salt between, into a tub or box, the bottom of which has also 
been covered with salt. The process of salting will be complete in ifive 
weeks. At the end of that time have ready about a peck of hickory 
ashes; clean the hams with a brush or dry cloth and rub them with the 
ashes. To smoke the hams the joints, should be hung from joists beneath 
the ceiling and a slow, smothered fire kept up for five or six weeks, so 
as to smoke thoroughly, but not overheat the hams. Or, as an excellent 
substitute for this process, paint the hams with a coating of pyroligneous 
acid, let them dry and repeat the operation. Wrap each ham in paper 
and encase it in a canvas or strong cotton bag. 

A simple way to salt bacon and hams in brine is to rub the meat well 
with salt, especially into the exposed ends of bones, and then pack into 
a barrel, with a layer of salt between each piece. Allow the meat to 
remain thus for 48 hours, then pour over all a brine strong enough to 
bear up an egg. Let the meat remain in pickle six weeks ; then smoke. 

Molasses pickle is made as follows: To four quarts of fine salt and 
two ounces of pulverized saltpeter add enough .molasses to make a paste. 
Hang the hams in a cool dry place for three or four days after cutting 
up; then cover with the pickle mixture, thickest on the flesh side, and lay 
them skin down for three or four days. For 100 pounds of ham make 
brine in the following proportion: Seven pounds coarse salt; two ounces 
saltpeter; one-half ounce pearlash; four gallons soft water. Heat grad- 
ually, removing all scum as it arises, then cool. Pack the hams in a 
barrel, pour the brine over them, and keep in pickle five to eight weeks, 
according to size. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 31 

Ham, Sugar Cured. — To 50 pounds of ham or "side bacon" allow three 
pounds of sugar and a pint of molasses, six pounds of salt, one fuU 
tablespoonful of saleratus and the same of saltpeter. Cover the bottom 
of your firkin with salt (about two pounds). Mix sugar, molasses, salt- 
peter, saleratus and the remaining salt into a paste. Rub each piece 
thoroughly with this, work it in well and hard, and pack into the firkin, 
the rind downward. Cover all with cold water — ^just enough to rise above 
the meat. Lay a heavy board on top, weight it with a stone to keep the 
meat under water, and leave it thus for four weeks, turning the meat and 
stirring up the pickle every week. Take out, then wipe, rub into the 
pieces as much dry salt and an equal quantity of sugar as they will take 
up; pack in a dry firkin and leave for 24 hours before sending to the 
smokehouse. 

Hamburg Steak, Baked. — One and one-half pound raw chopped beef, 
two cupfuls of stale bread softened with half a cupful of hot milk and 
cooled, two eggs, small onion minced, teaspoonful of salt, saltspoonful 
of pepper and pinch of ginger. Mix well and shape into a square; place 
m baking pan with a tablespoonful of tomato, small onion and butter 
the size of a walnut on top of meat. Bake one hour, basting frequently. 
The potatoes should be boiled 15 minutes, then drained, pared and placed 
in pan with the Hamburg steak to cook 45 minutes, being turned and 
basted often. Medium-sized potatoes are best for this. Serve arranged 
around the meat. 

Hungarian Hamburg Steak. — Beat an egg into a bowl, stir in bread 
crumbs (about a cupful), a small onion, grated, salt and paprika (a mild- 
flavored cayenne pepper). The meat is stirred into this, and after thor- 
ough mixing is formed into a ball. An onion is fried brown in butter, 
put into an earthen saucepan with a tight-fitting cover, and the meat ball 
is added, with two tomatoes cut into quarters around it. After simmering 
for half an hour the meat is turned gently, so as not to break the ball, 
then allowed to cook quietly for nearly an hour, and served with the 
vegetables as a garnish. 

Senator Hanna's Hash. — This is the recipe given by the Boston Cook- 
ing School. Take equal portions of tender boiled corned beef and mealy 
boiled potatoes. Cut the potatoes into small cubes and the meat as fine 
as possible. Mix thoroughly with these a small onion, chopped very fine; 
a slice of onion is often sufficient. Butter a hot frying pan and turn into 
it chopped materials. Press into the center of the mass a clove of garlic, 
wrapped in a piece of salt pork or mild cured bacon. Set over a moderate 
fire, cover and let cook, adding a small quantity of water, if moist hash 
is preferred; when heated, stir, remove the garlic and give the whole 
round shape. I^et stand in the oven until browned underneath, then 
carefully slide on a serving dish. While the hash is cooking cut one or 



33 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

two Bermuda onions into thin slices and fry until crisp in deep fat. Use 
these as a garnish for the hash (or omit if preferred). Serve with lemon 
quarters. 

Hot-Pot.— Two pounds of cross-rib is cut in small pieces and put in 
an earthen saucepan, with two minced onions, five or six small green pep- 
pers, whole, a few chives, a handful of seeded raisins, a cupful of to- 
matoes, peeled and sliced, eight or 10 olives, a bit of thyme, a big table- 
spoonful of drippings, salt to taste, and a cupful of vinegar and water. 
The pot is covered tightly, and the mixture simmered slowly until the 
meat is cooked to pieces ; then a tablespoonful of butter well coated with 
flour is stirred in to thicken the gravy. 

Liver and Bacon in Casserole. — Slice liver about half an inch thick, 
and put in a buttered saucepan, peppering lightly. Over the liver lay a 
dozen thin slices of bacon, and strew these with chopped onion and par- 
sley. Cover closely and cook slowly for about two hours. The cooking 
must not be hurried. When ready to serve the liver, let the gravy, with 
the bacon in it, boil hard for two minutes, then pour it over the the 
liver in the serving dish. 

Liver, Fried in New Orleans Style. — Cut a pound of calf's liver in half-' 
inch cubes. After washing and draining, place in a bowl which has been 
rubbed with an onion. Between two layers of liver place a layer of 
chopped onion and parsley, sprinkling with salt and dusting lightly with 
cayenne. After half an hour take out the liver and shake off all the 
onion. Roll lightly in flour and drop into a deep kettle of boiling fat. 
Drain on paper and serve very hot with lemon. The liver cooks to de- 
licious tenderness and delicacy of flavor. 

Calves' Liver, English Style. — Two pounds of fresh liver, one-half 
pound fat salt pork, one spoonful of butter, half an onion, one spoonful 
chopped parsley and pepper. Put the butter in a warm, not hot, sauce- 
pan, cut the liver into slices half an inch thick and lay upon the butter; 
mince the pork and cover the liver; sprinkle the parsley and onion with 
pepper on top; cover the saucepan closely and set it into a kettle of hot 
water; keep this water below the boiling point for an hour, then let it 
boil another hour; the liver will by this time be very tender and juicy 
if the heat has been properly adjusted. Take it out and place it in a 
dish to keep warm. Thicken the gravy with brown butter and pour over 
the liver and serve. 

English Meat Pie.— Chop cold beef finely, put in a deep baking dish 
a layer of the meat, strew lightly with bread crumbs, season highly with 
solt, pepper, butter and a few drops of onion juice; repeat the process 
till the dish is full or your meat used up. Pour over it a cup of stock 
or gravy, or, lacking these, hot water with a teaspoonful of butter melted 
in it; on top a good layer of bread crumbs should be put and seasoned 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. S3 

and dotted with butter. Cover and bake half an hour; remove the cover 
and brown. 

Mock Duck. — Four pork tenderloins; slash lengthwise, rub with salt 
and pepper, fill with dressing made of bread crumbs, one onion, one egg, 
one-half cupful butter, salt and pepper to taste; tie together and bake in 
roaster. Serve with hot apple sauce made as follows : Pare and quarter 
(if large, cut in eighths) as many apples as the family appetite requires. 
Put a layer of apples in a granite or enameled shallow pan, put bits of 
butter, goodly supply sugar and dash of cinnamon on the apples. Do this 
in layers till pan is full; add a little water and bake till rich and clear, 
not just barely done. 

. Mutton Mince With Eggs. — Scrape_ every morsel of meat from the 
bone, crack the latter, cover with cold water and let it simmer at the 
back of the stove for four or five hours. Strain off the cupful of liquid 
and thicken with a lump of butter rolled in browned flour; season with 
salt, pepper and tomato catsup; stir into it the cold mutton cut small 
and a handful of bread crumbs, strewing some of these on top; bake 
until the surface bubbles, drop four or five eggs upon the top, pepper 
and salt them, set back in the oven and leave there until the eggs are 
"set." 

Mutton Pie. — A mutton pie made from the neck of mutton is as 
savory as it is economical. Cut off the spine bone and the scrag end, 
shorten the ribs to about three inches, but save all these trimmings to 
make the gravy for the pie. Cut the mutton into neat chops, pare off 
the fat, season with salt and pepper and place in the deep pie dish in a 
circle, one lapping over the other. Fill the center with tiny potato balls 
cut out with the cutter; add the mutton gravy which has been boiled to 
make the quantity required, sprinkle with salt and pepper, cover with good 
pie crust brushed over with the yolk of an egg and bake for an hour 
and a half in a moderate oven. 

Ragout of Mutton. — Use two pounds of mutton from the shoulder or 
breast. Cut in small pieces, about two inches square. Cut up some of 
the mutton fat which has not touched the skin and fry slowly in a pan 
until there is about a gill of liquid fat; take out the solid pieces and put 
in the mutton and stir until it becomes brown. Take the meat from the 
fat, being careful to press out all the fat. To the fat add one pint of 
turnip cubes and two tablespoonfuls of onion cut fine; cook slowly for 
10 minutes, then take them out and put in the stew pan with the meat. 
Pour the fat from the frying pan and put in two tablespoonfuls of butter 
and the same amount of flour; stir until brown, when add one quart of 
boiling water. When this thickens add it to the meat and vegetables with 
a rounding teaspoonful of salt and one-third of a teaspoonful of pepper. 
Sirhmer for three hours, covered.

"Pawnhas."— This old-fashioned dish is similar to scrapple. Boil to- 
gether the "jowls," liver and heart of a hog until very tender. Take out 
all bones, chop the heart and meat from jowls until very fine;; crumble 
the liver as finely as possible and put all back into the kettle. Now . 
season with pepper and salt, and be sure to add enough water to keeip 
it from being too rich or greasy. Stir in white cornmeal until you have 
a thin mush, let cook slowly half an hour, pour into a large crock or 
jar; set away to cool. When cold, slice like mush and put into a skillet 
to fry. Add no grease. This is delicious and will keep indefinitely in 
a cool place. 

Pigeons, Potted.— Place six cleaned birds in a deep kettle with one 
pint of vinegar and three onions, halved ; let stand over night, then throw 
the vinegar and onions away. Brown six slices of pork and two onions, 
sliced; place in the kettle with the pigeons; add one pint of hot water, 
salt and pepper; cover and simmer about two hours; serve the pigeons 
on a hot dish about a mound of parsley; strain the liquor, thicken, and 
pass in a gravy boat. 

Pigs' Feet in Jelly. — Thoroughly scrape and clean one dozen pigs' feet. 
Place them in a kettle, cover with boiling water, add one tablespoonful 
of salt and simmer steadily until tender. Transfer the feet to a stone 
crock, placing between them thin slices of onion. Heat and boil to- 
gether for five minutes two quarts of good vinegar, one bay leaf, two 
tablespoonfuls of sugar, one dozen whole cloves, six tiny red peppers, and 
one-half teaspoonful of salt. Add one quart of boiling water and pour 
at once over the pigs' feet. Cover and let stand two days before using. 
Pilgrim Pie. — Cut a two-pound piece of fresh pork into dice, after it 
is cooked, and prepare the following crust: One pint mashed potatoes, 
owe-half teaspoonful salt, one tablespoonful butter, one-fourth teaspoon- 
ful pepper, one-fourth cup of milk, one level teaspoonful baking powder, 
and enough flour to make a crust which can be easily rolled out one 
inch thick. Put alternate layers, in a baking dish, of the diced pork, 
raw oysters, minced parsley, a light dusting of Summer savory, finely 
shredded onion, with salt and pepper to suit, and one tablespoonful but- 
ter ; cover with a brown sauce ; fit a cover of the potato biscuit and bake 
in hot oven 20 minutes. Five minutes before it is finished draw out, cover 
with fine cracker crumbs mixed with one egg; return to the oven to 
finish browning; garnish with parsley. This potato crust is excellent for 
any meat pie. 

Pork With Corn Dumplings. — Cook a piece of shoulder of pork in a 
big pot until tender; then mix the desired quantity of cornmeal to • 
thick dough as in making bread (the addition of an egg to the dough im- 
proves the dumplings). Drop balls of the dough about the size of a 
walnut in the boiling water about the meat in the pot and cook 20 min- 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 3S 

utes, when the dumplings will be done, and will have a thick gravy 
around them. Take care not to let the mixture burn. The fat and 
juices of the meat season the dumplings excellently. 

Rabbit, Jugged. — Select a plump tender rabbit. Wash, wipe dry, and 
cut into well-shaped pieces. Have ready a teaspoonful of salt and one- 
fourth teaspoonful of pepper and rub this into the rabbit pieces. Put 
four tablespoonfuls of flour on a plate and roll each piece in this. Heat 
half a cupful of butter in frying pan; when hot fry the rabbit, browning 
on both sides, being careful not to burn the butter. As soon as it 
browns put the rabbit into a stewpan and into the hot butter stir what is 
left of the flour in which the rabbit was rolled; add three teacupfuls hot 
water and cook 10 minutes. Pour this over the rabbit, adding two 
cloves, one-half bayleaf, two or three allspice, one teaspoonful salt, one- 
fourth' teaspoonful pepper, a slice or two of onion. Cover closely and 
simmer for an hour and a half. Add one teaspoonful lemon juice and 
one tablespoonful good catsup. Remove the rabbit to a hot platter; 
strain what liquid is left, add to it a teaspoonful each of butter and flour 
rubbed smooth and a cupful of hot water; boil up once, pour over the 
rabbit and serve. 

Rabbit, Breaded. — Dress the rabbit, then let it soak over night in cold 
salt water. Cut into neat pieces, and boil gently until tender in clear 
water to which an onion has been added. Let it cool and drain; then 
dip in well-beaten egg, roll in cracker crumbs and fry in hot butter. 
Serve with cranberry sauce. Barbecued rabbit, a favorite southern dish, 
may also be recommended: Lay the rabbit in salt and water 30 minutes, 
then scald with boiling water and wipe dry, rub well with butter, and 
sprinkle with pepper and salt. Broil until quite brown, and lay on a 
hot dish ; butter plentifully on both sides. Prepare a sauce of four tea- 
spoonfuls of vinegar, one teaspoonful of made mustard, one of currant 
jelly and one of walnut catsup. Pour this hot over the rabbit. 

Ragout with Dumplings. — ^Get a piece of nice, fresh round steak, 
about one and one-half pound (cut thick). Cut it into pieces about an 
inch square, smother it with flour, well seasoned with salt and red pep- 
per. Brown in the frying pan one large onion or two small ones, with 
about one large tablespoonful of butter; then add the steak and brown. 
Put the whole into a granite saucepan, pour over it five pints of boiling 
water and simmer two hours. About 30 minutes before serving make 
dumplings as follows: A cup of flour sifted with a little salt and a half 
teaspoonful of baking powder, and rub in a teaspoonful of butter. Mix 
very soft with milk — so soft that it is slightly sticky; drop by small 
spoonfuls into the stew and cover tightly until served. 

Sausage. — ^This is a Virginia recipe. To every 10 pounds of meat 
use three ounces of salt, one of black pepper, one-half ounce of lage 



38 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

rubbed fine. Having all ingredients weighed, put a layer of the meat 
cut in strips, sprinkle the mixed seasoning over it, another layer of meat 
with more seasoning, distributing as evenly as possible. Run twice 
throungh the grinder, and when it is put on the table it is surprising 
to see how quickly it vanishes. Ordinary pork sausage, smoked in bags, 
makes a desirable change, and keeps well. Pack the sausage meat in 
small bags of coarse, strong muslin, the size selected being that most 
convenient for slicing; small salt sacks, well washed, may answer. Close 
the bags, and then smoke, just like ham, the amount of smoking depend- 
ing on the family taste. When used, split down the seam of the bag 
for convenience in cutting the slices, and fry like ham. 

Sausage, Bologna. — Six pounds of lean beef; one pound salt pork; 
three pounds lean fresh pork ; one pound beef suet ; one ounce white pep- 
per; one teaspoonful ground mace; three ounces salt; one teaspbonful 
cayenne; one large onion chopped fine. Chop the meat and suet sep- 
arately very fine, then mix; add all the seasoning, and mix thoroughly. 
Fill into casings and tie into lengths, or use strong linen bags. Make a 
brine that will bear an egg; put the sausage into it, and let stand two 
weeks, turning and skimming every day. At the end of the first week 
throw away the old brine, and put the sausage into new for the second 
week; then "smoke for a week. When smoked rub over the outside with 
olive oil, and store in a cool, dark dry place. If you wish to keep the 
sausage for any length of time sprinkle the outside with pepper. 

Sausage, Frankfurter. — Chop up pork, lean meat and fat (ham can 
be used) in the proportion of four pounds lean to one of fat. To a 
pound of the mixture season with salt, 11 grams, one-half gram salt- 
petre, two grams white pepper and one-half gram cloves. Mix the whole 
so intimately that "you cannot tell the fat pieces from the lean." The 
more thorough the mixing the better the result. If the mixing is not 
free, you can add a little water, but do not overdo this. If too "waxy'' 
from excess of fat, add lean; or, the other way, if too meaty. Use pig's 
cases for the filling. Tie the sausage in length desired. Hang the links 
well apart in the smokehouse. Tolerable heat will do them rightly 
enough, but if yOu want the deep rich tint of brown, you will have to 
finish them off over a brick fire. It is hard to fix the temperature, 
as the smokehouse in the open will be cooler than the one indoors. Test 
the state by running a quill in and examining the extract by the taste, 
sight and smell. Sometimes they are put in bundles of 10 or 12 folded 
together and pressed to flatten. Keep in a box under weight before put- 
ting in the smoke.. 

Sausage, Holland Home. — Grind, mix and season the meat as de- 
sired. Instead of stuffing "cases," pack in half-gallon stone jars (but- 
ter jars). Bake four hours in a moderately hot oven. Remove from 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 37 

the oven and press with a heavy weight la hours — over night usually. 
Then remove the weight. There will be some fat, but not enough to 
cover it. Heat lard to the boiling point and pour over enough to cover. 
This seals — excludes the air. Keep in a cool place. Beef or pork may be 
kept in this way indefinitely. 

Oxford Sausage. — One pound each of finely chopped veal, pork and 
beef suet. Mix through this one quart of bread crumbs, grated peel of 
half a lemon, a grated nutmeg, a sprig each of savory, thyme and sweet 
marjoram and a tablespoonful of powdered sage leaves. Make in cakes 
and fry in very little hot butter. 

Sausage, Pork and Beef. — For 10 pounds of sausage use seven and 
one-half pounds of pork and two and a half of beef; grind fine, add two 
tablespoonfuls of salt, one teaspootiful each of pepper, allspice, cloves and 
sage. Heat all together until so hot you cannot hold your finger in it. 
Turn into stone jars that have been thoroughly scalded and aired, cover 
with cheesecloth and pour hot suet over the cloth. When any is wanted 
for use, take out and make into cakes and fry. 

Summer Sausage. — ^Use any recipe you like best, but use cloth casings 
made from muslin, casings to have a diameter of three to four inches, 
and length to fit a baking pan. Casings are easily made with sewing 
machine. Smoke the finished sausage to your heart's content. After 
smoking let sausage dry sufficiently, which takes four or five weeks, de- 
pending on where hung to dry. The sausage should be fit for eating, 
which can readily be ascertained by cutting one through. When dry 
enough melt a quantity of paraffin — about one-half pound for a dozen 
sausages — ^put in baking pan, then place the sausages therein and roll 
about in the hot paraffin, one at a time. Hang up in a dry place and 
they will keep nicely and indefinitely. 

Virginia Beef Sausage. — Mix two cupfuls of finely-chopped raw beef, 
1J4 cupful of fat. salt pork minced very fine, two teaspoonfuls of pow- 
dered sage, a scant teaspoonful of pepper — the pork should furnish suffi- 
cient salt — and one tablespoonful of lemon juice. When thoroughly 
mixed pack it in small round tin cans and set away to become hard. 
When jvanted for breakfast slice three-fourths of an inch thick and 
either brown in the oven or fry in a hot, well-greased pan. 

Scrapple, Philadelphia. — Take a cleaned pig's head and boil until the 
flesh strips easily from the bones. Remove all the bones and chop fine. 
Set the liquor in which the meat was boiled aside until cold, take the 
cake of fat from the surface and return the liquor to the fire. ' When it 
.boils, put in the chopped meat and season well with pepper and salt. Let 
it boil again and thicken with cornmeal as you would in making ordinary 
cornmeal mush, by letting it slip slowly through the fingers to prevent 
lumps. Cook an hour, stirring constantly at first, "afterward putting back

on the range in a position to boil gently. When done, pour into a long, 
square pan, not too deep, and mold. In cold weather this can be kept 
several weeks. Slice and fry brown in butter or dripping. 

Souse. — Clean pig's ears and feet well; cover them with cold water 
slightly salted and boil until tender. Pack in stone jars while hot, and 
cover while you make ready for pickle. To half a gallon of good cider 
vinegar allow half a cup of white sugar, three dozen whole black pep- 
pers, a dozen blades of mace and a dozen cloves. Boil this one minute, 
taking care that it really boils, and pour while hot over the still warm 
feet and ears. It will be ready to use in two days and will keep in a cool 
place for two months. If you wish it for breakfast, make a batter of 
one egg, one cup of milk, salt to taste, and a teaspoonful of butter, with 
enough flour for a thin muffin batter; dip each piece in this and fry in 
hot lard or dripping. Or dip each in beaten egg, then in pounded 
cracker before frying. Souse is also good eaten cold, especially the feet. 

Stew, Oven. — Two or three pounds of beef shin are selected, the bone 
being broken into three or four pieces. After wiping with a damp cloth, 
remove all the meat from the bone and cut into small pieces for serving. 
Scrape the marrow from the bone and place in a kettle, and in it brown 
first the meat, then the vegetables cut in cubes-^half an onion and one 
carrot. Now dredge well with flour and salt, adding about a tablespoon- 
ful of browned flour to give color. Add one or two whole cloves, one- 
half cup of tomato or a little tomato catsup, then the pieces of bone. 
Cook in the oven in a deep iron meat-pan for three or four hours, adding 
potatoes, cut in cubes, one hour before serving. 

Stew, Tomato. — Fry a tiny onion, or a slice or two of ordinary size, 
in a couple of tablespoonfuls of fat. Add two or three slices of carrot 
and let them brown. Then stir in a cupful of canned tomatoes and half a 
cupful of beef stock or gravy. If stock is used the mixture should be 
thickened with a little flour. Add also half a bayleaf and a couple of 
sprays of Summer savory, and simmer the stew slowly for half an hour, 
so that it may be permeated with the seasonings. At the end of this time 
add the cold meat from a shank of beef, or any "leftover," cut in small 
pieces. Simmer very slowly for five or 10 minutes and serve hot, after 
dashing in a little salt and pepper. 

Tough Meat. — To soften a tough steak pour a few spoonfuls of vine- 
gar, or vinegar and oil mixed, over it, and allow it to stand 13 to 24 
hours, turning occasionally. A tough piece of meat may be laid in vine- 
gar (not too strong) for three or four days in Summer, or twice as long in 
Winter. Oil or spices may be added to the vinegar if desired, this bath 
being termed a marinade. Tough meat should receive long gentle cook- 
ing, preferably in an enclosed vessel which will prevent evaporation of 
juices. Such beef should not be treated like a tender rib roast; it would 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 39 

better be braised (pot roast) or cooked as beef a la mode. The mar- 
inade will be found desirable when the meat is cooked in this way. If 
stewed, the same system of prolonged gentle cooking (preferably in an 
earthen stewpan or casserole) should be employed. 

Stuffed Tenderloin. — Procure a good-sized tenderloin, slit one side 
open and lay within a dressing made as follows : One cupful of dry grated 
crumbs, one tablespoonful of minced parseley, one large teaspoonful of 
mixed sweet herbs, thyme. Summer savory, sweet marjoram and sage, 
one heaping teaspoonful of finely chopped onion fried in one tablespoon- 
ful of butter, one-half teaspoonful salt, one saltspoonful pepper. If this 
amount of butter does not make it moist enough add a trifle more melted 
butter, but no water. Stuff the tenderloin and sew up the opening. If 
it is not fat place two or three slices of bacon over the top, fastening 
with wooden toothpicks. Rub into the meat one teaspoonful of salt, one- 
fourth teaspoonful of white pepper. Dust with flour and roast. When 
done remove the tenderloin to a heated platter and put the roasting pan 
on top of stove, adding one tablespoonful of flour to the gravy which it 
contains. When thoroughly browned add a cupful of hot water, two 
tablespoonfuls of chopped gherkins, and one tablespoonful of finely- 
chopped olives. 

Veal and Ham Pie. — A pound of veal cutlet cut in small pieces is 
rolled in flour and browned in hot bacon fat. Cover with boiling water, 
or, if possible, with stock made from the trimmings of veal and seasoned 
with sweet herbs, carrot and onion, and simmer for about two hours 
Put the pieces of veal in a baking dish. Have ready half a cupful of 
finely chopped cooked ham. Add to it a little of the liquid in which the 
veal was cooked, and pound smooth in a mortar. Then press through a 
puree sieve, and add the rest of the liquid with such seasoning as may 
be desired. Pour this over the meat in the dish, adding half a pint of 
oysters and a few bits of butter. Cover the dish with a pastry or rich 
biscuit crust, and bake about 25 minutes. 

Veal, Paprika Schnitzel. — Cut two pounds of thick veal steak into 
small pieces, roll in seasoned flour, fry brown in salt pork fat. Remove 
the meat from the pan, add two tablespoonfuls of flour to the remaining 
fat, brown lightly and pour in the strained liquid from a pint can of to- 
matoes, or if desired slice in a pint of fresh peeled tomatoes. Add a 
slice each of onion and carrot, three bay leaves and a bit of mace, then 
return the meat to the sauce, cover closely and simmer for three-quarters 
of an hour. When done remove the meat, add a little more salt if neces- 
sary (the pork helps to season) a pinch of paprika or red pepper, and 
strain on to the platter. 



CHAPTER IV. 

PASTRY AND PIES. 

When pieplant gives the first good mess, 

With nice hot biscuit, I confess 
Our folks feel gooa. Pop says : "I guess 

You ought to have a bran' new dress." 
"And you a coat," I sez, "no less !" 

I know our folks will always bless 
The day that pieplant gives first mess. 

Some of our friends, who have spent many years abroad, tell of a 
Roman pension or boarding-house whose proprietor boasted that he had 
recipes for more than 365 delicious desserts. During the months our 
friends were at the pension they never had the same dessert twice, which, 
they complained, was really pathetic, for many of the dishes were so 
delicious that they longed for a repetition. We doubt whether anyone 
could duplicate that experience in an American boarding-house, where, 
too often, pie is almost the only form of dessert, except a restricted range 
of puddings. The unwholesome effect of pastry often results, we believe, 
from eating it as the finish to a hearty meal, when the digestion is already 
fully tasked. We are told by those who use it that the oil pie crust, 
recipe for which is given, is more easily digested than that made with 
other shortening. 

Pie Crust. — For one pie use one cupful sifted flour, one-half cup of 
shortening, pinch of salt. It will be much flakier if chopped together 
with a knife, instead of rubbing in the hands. Stir in enough cold water 
to mix it so it may be rolled out. Handle as little as possible, and keep 
very cold. It is improved by making a day before using, and storing in 
the icebox or other cold place. 

Cream Pie Crust. — If one can use cream, delicious crust may be made. 
Add baking powder and salt to the flour and mix stiff with cream that is 
not too heavy. The crust is tender, browns quickly and has a very sweet, 
agreeable flavor. 

Oil Pie Crust. — For this either olive or refined cotton-seed oil may 
be used. For- one pie take one cup flour, add pinch of salt, mix and add 
two tablespoonfuls oil; rub well together and add three tablespoonfuls 
cold water. Handle dough as little as possible and roll thin. 

Puff Paste. — Use equal weights of flour and butter; by measure, one 
pint of flour and one cup of butter. Wash the butter in cold water 
until all the salt is out; the hands should first be washed in hot, then 
cold water, to prevent the butter from sticking. When washed until 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 41 

smooth and waxy divide butter into four parts, pat until thin, wrap in 
a napkin and place upon ice. Mix a little salt with the flour, mix in 
about one-half cup of ice water, stirring it in with a knife, and cut 
until it can be taken up clean from the bowl. Put on a well-floured 
board, roll until one-half inch thick. Roll one portion of the butter thin, 
fold it up inside the paste, pat and roll out again. Repeat this process 
with the rest of the butter. When putting in the butter, fold the sides 
of the paste over it toward the middle, then the ends over, and double; 
then roll. This process should continue until no streaks of fat are shown. 
Whenever the butter becomes soft, it should be chilled, and when finished 
the paste should be wrapped in a napkin, and kept in the refrigerator. 
This is the paste used for patty cases, and similar delicate pastry. It 
requires a "knack" as well as a recipe to get good results. 

Crust for Raised Pies. — This is the crust used by English house- 
keepers for pork and other meat pies, in which the crust is patted and 
shaped into a deep dish shape, which is filled with meat and then covered 
with a top crust. The crust is hard and stiff when cold, but softens 
when warm. Put one cupful of water in a saucepan, add one pound of 
lard, put on stove to meJt, and allow it to come to boiling point, stirring 
well; sift about three pounds of flour into a bowl, make a hole in the 
middle, and stir in the hot liquid, mixing with a spoon until it is cool 
enough to knead with the hands. It may require the addition of more 
flour, as it should be very stiff. To make a pork pie, this crust should 
be molded with the hands into a dish shape four or five inches deep; 
an oval four or five by six inches is a convenient size. Good, tender, 
fresh roasting pork is cut into half-inch pieces, and well seasoned; the 
pie is filled and covered, after a small amount of water is sprinkled over, 
and then the pie is baked for about I5/2 hour, in a steady oven. It is 
always served cold. Game birds or pigeons make excellent raised pie 
also. To give a shining yellow appearance to the pastry, brush it over 
with the yolk of an egg, beaten up with two tablespoonfuls of milk, 
about 10 minutes before it is taken out of the oven. 

Almond Bars. — Roll puff paste into thin narrow strips. Beat one 
egg white slightly and mix it with two tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar 
and one cupful of finely-chopped almonds. Spread this mixture over the 
strips of paste and brown them in the oven. Sometimes the almonds are 
rolled into the paste. Mix two tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar with 
the same amount of chopped almonds and sprinkle over the paste when 
first rolled out. Fold and roll again, then repeat the process. Finally cut 
into long sticks, brush with white of an egg and brown in the oven. One 
teaspoonful of cinnamon may be used in place of the almonds, when th« 
result will be cinnamon bars.

Apple Pie.— This is how a Michigan housekeeper makes it : The under 
crust was first brushed over lightly with white of an egg and allowed to 
stand while the rest of the work went on; this to keep the juices from 
soaking into the crust before baking. Next a half cupful of sugar was 
put in, along with a half to a tablespoonful of flour, according to the 
degree of juiciness of the apples, and a generous pinch of cinnamon or 
allspice according to choice. These were rubbed smoothly together to 
insure a jelly-like consistency of the finished pie, without the unpalatable 
doughy lumps. The fruit is then added, the remainder of the sugar 
poured over (a cupful in all for very sour apples), the top dotted thickly 
with butter, and unless the apples are very juicy a dessertspoonful of 
water added. The edge of the under crust is now moistened with water, 
the top applied and the two pinched neatly together; the whole brushed 
over with rich milk to insure an even golden-brownness, and a tiny funnel 
made of writing paper twisted and pinned into shape inserted in the air 
hole cut in the top. These details observed you may now put your pie 
into the oven with a certainty that it will come out a thing of beauty, 
with none of its savory juices burning to a crisp in the bottom of 
the oven. For very young apples, however, she always used instead of 
the water, a generous tablespoonful of spiced vinegar (left over from 
any spiced Sweet pickle) with a little more flour. Or if apples had been 
kept some time and were shriveled and insipid, she found the same treat- 
ment a vast improvement. Lacking the spiced vinegar she sometimes used 
lemon juice with an additional sprinkling of sugar and spices. Other fruit 
pies were made in a similar manner, always taking into consideration the 
qualities of the fruit as to acidity and juiciness. For canned fruits 
already sweetened, such as huckleberries, elderberries and the like, which 
were very juicy and required no extra sweetening, she usually rubbed the 
flour (in same proportion of a spoonful to a pie) in a bit of the juice, 
and added it with whatever spices were necessary to the rest of the fruit, 
and set it over the fire until the flour was cooked, adding a little butter. 
When cold the mixture was filled into the prepared paste, egg-brushed 
as before. For custard or pumpkin she usually prepared the paste by 
setting the pan on top of the stove until the crust was nearly cooked 
through, then adding the custard and putting it at once into a hot oven. 
When sweet cider is at hand, it may be used to give additional flavor to 
an apple pie. Warm half a cupful of cider and, 10 minutes before the 
pie is taken from the oven, pour the cider into it through the hole in the 
center of top crust, using a little funnel of stiff paper to prevejit splashing. 

Appleless Apple Pie. — Soak two large soda crackers in a large cup of 
boiling water. Add small piece butter. When cool add two tablespoon- 
fuls vinegar, one cup sugar, a few raisins and a little nutmeg^. Bake with 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 4S 

two crusts as you do the real apple pie. Another appleless apple pie is 
made from pumpkins as follows : Procure a good sound pumpkin (or 
squash), wash, cut a round of same, as deep as an ordinary apple is, from 
stem to blossom end; peel, cut down crosswise in slices about an eighth 
of an inch thick; put in water enough to cover, and stew slowly until 
tender, but not mushy. Lift carefully from the water, let cool. Prepare 
crust as for apple pie, line your tins with the crust, place your slices of 
pumpkin just as you would slices of apple; sprinkle over them a little 
flour — not over a tablespoonful of sugar; add one tablespoonful of pure 
cider vinegar to each pie, a few lumps of butter, finish with a top crust. 
Bake to a rich brown color in a moderate oven. 

Vermont Blackberry Pie. — Line a deep dripping pan with pastry, cover 
the bottom with a generous layer of blackberries, sprinkle with sugar and 
cover with a crust. Bake, then add another layer of blackberries and 
sugar, cover with a top crust, and then bake again. This is recommended 
as highly delicious, either hot or cold. 

Buttermilk Pie. — Beat together a heaping cupful of sugar and four 
eggs; add half a cupful of butter; beat thoroughly and add lyi pint of 
fresh buttermilk; line pie tins with crust; slice an apple thin and lay 
in each pie; fill crust with the mixture and bake with one crust. - 

Butterscotch Pie. — Two eggs, one cup brown sugar, butter size of 
walnut, tablespoon of flour, one cup cream, one teaspoon vanilla. Cream 
the butter, sugar and flour together, add the beaten yolks, cream and 
flavoring. Pour this into a good baked pie crust and return to the oven. 
When it has thickened spread over it the whites beaten very stiff, with 
two level tablespoons of sugar. Have the oven quite cool while the 
meringue is browning. 

Carrot Pie. — Scrape the skin off the carrots, boil them soft and strain 
them through a sieve. To a pint of the strained pulp put three pints of 
milk, six beaten eggs, two tablespoonfuls of melted butter, the juice of 
half a lemon and the grated rind of a whole one. Sweeten it to your 
taste, and bake it in deep pie plates without an upper crust. 

Cheese Cakes. — This is a rich English dainty. Take four ounces of 
butter, and cream it in a warm pan ; add four ounces of sugar, beat well ; 
add the yolk of one egg, beat again, then add one whole egg; beat all 
well together, and mix in four ounces of currants. Line patty pans 
with paste, fill with the mixture, shake a little sugar over the top, and bake. 

Curd Cheese Cakes.— Add one egg to one cupful of fresh curd; beat 
smooth, and beat in one-half cupful of sugar, and a piece of butter the 
size of a walnut. Flavor with nutmeg or any other spice, and use as 
filling for a pie without top crust. A richer curd cheese cake is made 
by using the recipe given for ordinary cheese cakes, and beating the curd 
into it before the currants are added. 



44 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Chocolate Pie.— Line a deep pie pan with rich pie crust and bake in a 
quick oven. Grate one-half teacupful of chocolate and_put into a sauce- 
pan, with one cupful of hot water, butter the size of an egg, one table- 
spoonful vanilla, one cupful of sugar, the beaten yolk of two eggs and 
two tablespoonfuls of cornstarch, dissolved in a little water; mix well; 
cook until thick, stirring constantly. Pour into the pie shell and let cool. 
Beat the whites of the two eggs to a stiff froth, add two tablespoonfuls 
of powdered sugar, spread on top of pie and slightly brown in oven. 

Cider Jelly Pie.— This is a tested old-fashioned recipe. A half pint of 
boiled cider, a cupful of brown sugar, a cupful of boiling water and two 
tablespoonfuls of cornstarch. Stir the cornstarch into the cider, add the 
other ingredients and cook for 10 minutes. Fill into a pastry-lined pie 
tin and cover with an upper crust. 

Cream Pie. — Mix thoroughly two cups of flour and five tablespoonfuls 
of butter, then add three tablespoonfuls of sugar and one large egg, which 
has been thoroughly beaten together previously. Roll an eighth of an inch 
thick, line two pie tins, prick with a folk and bake a pale brown, then 
fill with this cream: Two cups milk, two tablespoonfuls of cornstarch, 
five tablespoonfuls of sugar, yolks of five eggs. Cook together like cus- 
tard, and when cold cover with meringue made of whites of five eggs and 
five tablespoons powdered sugar. 

New England Cream Tart Pie. — Select firm Esopus apples and make 
as dry an apple sauce as possible, sweetened slightly and strained. For 
a large-sized pie use one pint of apple, one pint of thick cream, yolks of 
two eggs beaten stiff, and one-half of a nutmeg. An under crust only 
is used, and this may be baked the day before. Fill and bake about one- 
half hour. Use the whites of two eggs for the meringue and brown in 
the oven. Greenings are good -for this pie when Esopus is not at hand, 
but apples of low quality should not be used for it. 

Crumb Pie. — Soak a pint of bread crumbs in milk. Beat three eggs; 
add half a cup of sugar. Line two pie plates with crust and strew over 
enough raisins to cover bottom. Add the bread crumbs to egg and milk, 
sifting in a bit of cinnamon, pour over the raisins and bake about 30 
minutes. 

Date Pie. — For one pie take one heaping cupful of pastry flour, add a 
pinch of salt and mix to the right consistency with sweet cream. The 
crust will be much nicer if allowed to get very cold before using. Filling 
—To a cupful of seeded dates add a cupful of water, cook over hot water 
about 20 minutes, then- rub through a sieve. Beat an egg and a table- 
spoonful of sugar until light; add a tablespoonful of lemon juice, the 
date paste and gradually a cupful of scalded milk. Pour into a half 
baked shell and finish baking in a moderate oven until a knife blade 
can penetrate it and come out clean. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 45 

Delectable Tarts. — One cup of slightly sour cream, one cup of seeded 
and chopped raisins, one cup of sugar and one egg with a delicate flavor- 
ing of spices. Beat the egg light, add the cream and sugar; the raisins 
well floured and spices. Bake in tart or patty pans with a single crust. 

Elderberry Pie. — Line a pie dish with paste, upon which sprinkle a 
scant tablespoonful of flour; to this add a half cup of sugar and a half 
teaspoonful each of cloves and cinnamon, rubbing all together evenly. 
Upon this pour the berries, a pint more or less according to the size of 
your pie dish; pour over another half cup of sugar, dot generously with 
butter, adding last one large tablespoonful of good vinegar. Apply top 
crust quickly and bake. 

Grape Cobbler. — This is best made from very ripe black grapes. Wash 
them twice — on the bunches and after picking. Line a deep pie dish with 
half-inch rich crust, put in the grapes and all the sugar that will lie 
between them, heaping the fruit a little in the middle. Put on the top 
crust, cut cross slits in the middle and fold back the corners to leave 
an open square. Set the dish in a quick oven and while the pie bakes 
make a sauce, using half a cup of butter, one cup of sugar and one table- 
spoon boiling water. Stir well over hot water and flavor with lemon 
juice, or grated nutmeg, according to taste. When the pie is nearly done 
take it out, pour in the sauce through the opening in the crust, return 
it to the oven. Be careful not to overbake, but keep it hot until served. 

Grape Roll. — ^Allow half the weight of the grapes in sugar and only 
water enough to keep from burning; seed the grapes; allow one pint of 
cooked grapes for the roll. To make the dough cream one-half teacupful 
of butter with one pint of sifted flour; add one teacupful of milk, two 
eggs well beaten, a saltspoonful of salt and a teaspoonful of baking 
powder; roll out on the board in two long ovals, roll up and pinch the 
ends, lay in a buttered dish, set the dish to bake and twice pour over 
them a sauce of a tablespoonful of butter and a tablespoonful of sugar 
mixed together, to which is added one-half teacupful of boiling water 
(for one basting). Serve the rolls with the same kind of sauce made 
richer and flavored with nutmeg. 

Green Apple Slump. — Stew and strain a quart of green apples and 
sweeten to taste. Make a biscuit crust with two cupfuls of flour, one 
heaping teaspoonful of baking powder, one tablespoonful of butter and 
one-half teaspoonful of salt, and moisten with sweet milk to a dough. 
Roll out one inch thick. Put the prepared hot sauce in a thick-bottomed 
saucepan, fit over it the crust and cover closely; first buttering the inside 
of the cover. Place where the sauce will simmer slowly but steadily 
for an hour. In serving put the crust on the dish, pour the sauce oyer 
jt and serye with cream. 



40 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Hasty Pie. — Place in a deep baking pan or dish any fresh or canned 
fruits to the depth of two or three inches. Beat together one egg, two 
tablespoonfuls of melted butter, one cupful sweet milk and one cupful of 
flour in which has been sifted one teaspoonful of baking powder. Pour 
this over fruit and bake until crust is well done. Eat with sweetened 
cream or any pudding sauce. Use but little syrup with fruit. The same 
recipe for batter makes good muffins. 

Jam Dumplings. — To one quart of sifted flour add two heaping tea- 
spoonfuls of baking powder, half teaspoonful of salt and four table- 
spoonfuls of sugar and sift several times. Beat two eggs light and add 
to a cup of milk; stir into the flour, adding a large tablespoonful of 
butter melted; add enough milk to make a soft dough; roll out, cut in 
squares, put a large spoonful of jam in center of each square, pinch the 
edges together, place them in a baking pan and bake them for 25 minutes; 
serve with vanilla sauce. 

Lady Lufkins. — Make a very rich, flaky pie crust, roll out very thin, 
cut into strips an inch wide, and wind each strip around a tube of metal 
or heavy manilla paper about two inches wide; bake until crisp and brown. 
This is the way in which bakers make their cream rolls. When cold, fill 
each roll with marmalade in the center and cream at the ends. 

Lemon Meringue. — Stir together the juice and rind of one lemon, one 
cupful of sugar, three-quarters of a cupful of water with one tablespoon- 
ful of cornstarch, and the yolks of four eggs. Bake in one crust and 
make a meringue of the four whites for the top, adding a little powdered 
sugar after having been stiffly beaten. If desired the whites of the eggs 
may be included in the filling, and two crusts used. 

Lemon Mince Pie. — Stir together two tablespoonfuls cornstarch thor- 
oughly cooked with a cupful of water, one cupful of sugar, one cupful of 
molasses, one cupful of chopped raisins, a little citron, the juice of two 
lemons, and the grated rind of one. Bake in two crusts. This makes 
several pies. 

Delicious Lemon Pie. — Beat one cup sugar, three tablespoons of flour, 
the yolks of two eggs, piece of butter size of a walnut, to a cream. Add 
the grated rind and juice of a lemon, then one cup of milk, gradually. 
Then fold in the whites of the eggs beaten to a froth. Bake in one crust. 

Maple Custard Pie.— Line a pie pan with any good paste. For the 
filling beat together the yolks of three eggs and one pint of cream; add 
one-third cup maple sugar shaved fine. Stir until the sugar is dissolved 
and bake in a quick oven. Delicious. 

Marlborough Pie.— Line a pie plate with very thin puflf paste. Take 
half cup of mixed orange, lemon and citron peel. Strew these in the 
liottow pf the dish. Beat the yolks of four eggs with a cup of butter mi 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 47 

scant cup of sugar. Heat in a double boiler until melted; then flavor with 
orange Juice and little grated peel. Pour into the dish and bake three- 
quarters of an hour. 

Milk Pie. — Line a pan eight inches in diameter with good paste, put 
dots of butter over the bottom until you have used about the size of a. 
walnut, dredge over alternately flour to the amount of one-fourth meas- 
uring cup and sugar to the amount of one-half cup, then sprinkle evenly 
over the top one level dessertspoon of cinnamon and pour in carefully, 
so as not to disturb the cinnamon, three-fourths cup milk and bake until 
crust is brown. 

Maryland Mincemeat. — Two pounds of lean beef; cook, let get cold, 
and pass through meat grinder; mix thoroughly with one pint of finely- 
minced suet, two quarts of chopped, high-flavored apples, one pint of 
stoned raisins, a scant pint of sugar, one-half pint of currants, one-third 
pound of citron shaved in fine shreds, a cupful of molasses (which is 
omitted if preferred, sugar taking its place), one tablespoonful each of 
ground mace and allspice, two tablespoonfuls of cinnamon, one-half table- 
spoonful of cloves, two grated nutmegs, one and a half tablespoonful of 
salt, juice and rind of one and a half lemon, same of sour orange, 
one-half cupful each of candied lemon and orange peel. Moisten with 
unfermented grape juice, sweet cider, peach or plum syrup. The syrup 
from sweet pickles is a great improvement. Pack solid in airtight jars. 

Green Tomato Mincemeat, Chop fine four quarts of green tomatoes, 
drain ofl[ all juice, cover with cold water, let come to a boil and scald 
for 30 minutes, then drain well. Add two pounds of brown sugar, one 
pound of seeded raisins, one-half pound of chopped citron, one large 
half cupful of finely-chopped suet, one tablespoonful of salt and one-half 
cupful of strong cider vinegar. Stir well together and cook till thick. 
When cold add one teaspoonful each of ground cinnamon and cloves and 
one teaspoonfid of grated nutmeg. Stir thoroughly and keep (while it 
lasts) in a stone jar. 

Mock Mince Pie with Cranberries. — ^One cupful bread crumbs, one 
cupful raisins, one cupful sugar, one cupful cranberries cut in halves, one 
level saltspoonful each of cinnamon, cloves, allspice and nutmeg, one cup- 
ful hot water, one-half cup vinegar and butter size of a large English 
walnut. Turn into a pie tin lined with flaky paste, place the top crust 
and bake in a brisk oven. 

Mock Pumpkin Pie.— Grate sweet apples, add milk, sugar, ginger and 
cinnamon, and one egg for each pie. Make the filling of the same con- 
sistency as pumpkin, and bake just like it. 

Peach Turnovers. — ^One pint of dried peaches stewed and sweetened 
with two tablespoonfuls of brown sugar; flavor with nutmeg to taste. 



48 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Make a stiflf crust, not as short as for other pies. Roll out pieces the 
size of a saucer. ' Cover one-half of the crust one-half inch deep with 
the stewed fruit. Fold over, pinch the edges together and prick with a 
silver fork. Fry like doughnuts, preferably in cooking oil; powder with 
sugar and serve with maple syrup. 

Pear Puffs.— Peel good pears, cut out the blossom end, but leave the 
stem; simmer the pears until tender in a weak syrup flavored with 
lemon, then drain, and allow them to cool. Make a good, rich pie crust, 
roll out thin, cut into triangular pieces, and cover each pear, pinching the 
crust neatly together, but leaving the stem protruding. Bake in a quick 
oven to a pale brown, and serve hot or cold. 

Prune Pie. — Stew half pound of prunes as for sauce. When quite soft 
remove the stones, sweeten, beat up and gradually fold in the whites of 
two eggs. Line deep pie tins with crust and bake twenty minutes. Then 
turn in the prune mixture; spread smoothly on top and pour over this 
a layer of well-sweetened and well-flavored apple sauce. Place in oven 
and bake twenty minutes longer. Eat hot or cold. 

Prune Pie No. 2. — One cupful of stewed and stoned prunes, chopped 
fine; three tablespoonfuls of the syrtip in which they were stewed, two 
eggs, yolks and white beaten separately, the whites to a stiff froth ; sugar, 
salt and flavoring to taste. The prunes should be soaked an hour or two 
in warm water before stewing, then cooked slowly several hours, putting 
them on with cold water enough nearly to cover them and enough sugar 
to make a rich syrup. Bake without upper crust. 

Prune Pie No. 3. — Cover a pie tin with rich crust, and then half fill 
with a layer of stewed prunes and their juice, the stones having been 
removed. Over the prunes pour a custard, made by beating up one egg 
and a teacupful of milk, a little nutmeg being grated over the top. The 
pie is baked until the custard is set. Little patty pans lined with pie crust 
and filled with the same material, are prune fanchonettes. 

Pumpkin Pie. — This recipe differs decidedly from those ordinarily used 
and is very good. Cut the pumpkin without paring, bake it, skin side 
down, until tender, and then scoop out the pulp and sift it. For one 
pie allow lyi cupful of pumpkin, one cupful of boiling milk, one teaspoon- 
ful of butter, half a cupful of sugar, half a teaspoonful of salt, one- 
quarter teaspoonful of cinnamon, same amount of ginger; add one egg, 
beaten separately. Half bake the crust, fill with the pumpkin and bake. 

Pumpkin Pie Without Eggs.— Let the pumpkin be of the pie variety, 
small, close-grained, and sweet. Steam it until tender, then press through 
a colander. To a pint of sifted pumpkin add one quart of rich milk, two 
level tablespoonfuls flour, one cupful sugar, two teaspoonfuls ginger and a 
pinch of salt. This is sufficient for two pies. Fill the crusts, sift on a 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 49 

little sugar and a dust of nutmeg, and bake. If the pumpkin is not up to 
the standard, one egg may be added, but not as a substitute for the flour, 
which gives body and smoothness to the filling. 

Raisin Pie. — One cupful of nice raisins; wash quickly, cover with 
boiling water, cook until tender; remove seeds; moisten a cupful of bread 
crumbs with the water, add one-fourth cupful of sugar, one egg (beaten), 
one tablespoonful lemon juice and the raisins, cut in two or three pieces 
each; an upper and lower crust of tender pastry and a satisfactory bake 
make a most delicious pie. 

Raisin Pie No. 2. — Boil one pound of seeded raisins in sufficient water 
to cover for one hour. Then add the juice and grated rind of one lemon, 
a piece of butter the size of an egg, one cupful of sugar, and two table- 
spoonfuls of cornstarch. Bake in two crusts. This makes filling for two 
pies. A second way of making a pie is to cook one cupful of raisins in 
one cupful of water until they are softened, add the grated rind and juice 
of one lemon, half a cupful of sugar, a sifting of cinnamon and sufficient 
powdered cracker crumbs to thicken. Bake in two crusts. 

Raisin Turnovers. — One cupful of seeded raisins, the rind of a lemon, 
or a few pieces of candied lemon or orange peel, and a small piece of 
preserved citron, chop all together finely, stir into this one beaten egg, 
and the juice of one lemon. Roll out puff paste thinly, and cut 'it in 
circles, lay them on a plate, fill with the mixture, then cover and press 
the edges firmly together. Bake the same length of time as you would 
a pie. 

Raspberry Cream Tart.— Line a pie plate with good paste, and fill with 
red raspberries, sweetened with powdered sugar. Cover with paste, but 
do not pinch it down at the edges. When it is done, lift the top crust, 
which is thicker than usual, and pour upon the fruit a cream made as 
follows: One small cup of rich milk, heated to boiling point; whites of 
two eggs beaten light and stirred into the boiling milk; one tablespoonful 
of white sugar; one-half teaspoonful of cornstarch wetted with cold 
milk. Boil three minutes, then let the cream get perfectly cold. Remove 
the top crust, pour the cream over the fruit, replace the crust, and set 
the pie away to cool. This recipe is given by Marion Harland ; our home 
recipe for fruit cream pie calls for a simple custard, using both white and 
yolk of one egg, which is poured over the fruit as above. Strawberry 
cream pie is made in the same way. 

Rhubarb Pie.— Cut in rather coarse pieces enough rhubarb to fill a 
large cup. Beat one egg thoroughly, adding a good pinch of salt, add 
the rhubarb, one cup of sugar and two soda crackers rolled fine. Mix 
thoroughly, then turn into a pie tin lined with pastry. Put a few bits of 
butter over it here and there, add a grating of nutmeg, and bake as a 



90 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

tart pie, bands of pastry laid over the top before baking. This quantity 
makes one pie — a small deep one, or a thin large one. 

Rhubarb Cream Pie. — One cupful of rhubarb chopped fine or grated, 
one cupful of sugar, a pinch of salt, a grating of nutmeg or lemon peel. 
Moisten a tablespoonful of cornstarch with a tablespoonful of cold water; 
then fill the cup up with boiling water, stirring until clear. Beat the 
yolks of three eggs until light, and add them with the cornstarch to the 
other materials. Line a pie plate with good light paste, fill with the 
mixture and bake in a moderately hot oven until custard is set. When 
done and cooled, cover with a meringue made with the whites of the 
eggs and half a cupful of confectioner's sugar. Brown delicately in 
the oven. 

Fresh Strawberry Pie. — Bake an empty bottom crust, making it extrt 
nice; prick holes all over the bottom and sides, to prevent its getting 
out of shape. As soon as baked sprinkle the inside with sugar and fill 
with ripe berries; also well dredge with sugar.- Cover with sweetened 
whipped cream and then cover all with a meringue of the frothed whites 
of two eggs mixed with two tablespoon fuls of sugar and a dash of 
lemon juice. Invert a plate in the oven and place the pie plate on top 
of it and brown. If the work is very carefully done the berries will not 
be even heated, and the result will be delicious. The pie should be 
thoroughly chilled before serving. 

Strawberry Pie No. 2. — Line a pie tin with rich crust shortened with 
butter, no baking powder being used. Let it cool, then fill with fresh 
strawberries, hulled and washed, and mixed with sugar. Cover with 
whipped cream and serve. 

Strawberry Pie No. 3. — ^Line a pie plate with good short crust, fill 
with ripe whole berries, liberally sugared, and then cover with a lattice 
formed of criss-cross strips of crust. By the time the crust is browned 
the berries are cooked in their own rich juice, and the pie is much 
nicer than with an ordinary double crust. 

Strawberry Cream Pie. — After picking over the berries carefully, 
arrange them in layers in a deep pie plate, sprinkling sugar thickly 
between each layer, having first lined the dish with your best pastry. 
Cover with a crust with a slit in the top and bake. When the pie is 
baked, pour into the slit in the top of the pie the following cream mix- 
ture: Take a small cupful of rich cream, heat until nearly boiling, then 
stir into it the whites of two eggs beaten lightly to a froth, also a table- 
spoonful of granulated or powdered sugar; boil all together a few 
moments. When cool, pour it into the pie through the slit in the crust 
Serve with powdered sugar sifted on top. 



CHAPTER V. 

PUDDINGS, HOT AND COLD. 

The proof of the pudding Is not in the eating, 
Never mind what the old sayings state ; 

The compliment setting the cook's heart a'beating 
Is the call for a big second plate. 

As a rule farm housekeepers are admirably situated for making 
delicious puddings, many of which are more wholesome than pastry. 
The recipes given below include considerable variety, and will be found 
suggestive, as many may be altered to suit material on hand. We were 
obliged to omit a number of good ones, owing to lack of space. 

Apricot Pudding. — This may be made from evaporated apricots, care- 
fully soaked and stewed, instead of the canned fruit. Butter a shallow 
pudding dish and sprinkle on the surface a layer of soft bread crumbs. 
Drain the syrup from a can of apricots and arrange a layer of fruit in 
the dish. Fill the cavities with sugar and a dot of butter the size of a 
pea on each. Cover each piece of fruit with another half to simulate the 
whole fruit, then fill the interstices with soft bread crumbs. Mix one 'pint 
of milk, the yolks of three eggs, well beaten, with one-quarter teaspoon 
of salt and three teaspoonfuls sugar, and pour this over the fruit. Lift 
the fruit a little so the custard may reach every part of the bread. Bake 
it about half an hour. Beat the whites of the eggs till stiff; add three 
heaped tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar and three teaspoonfuls of 
lemon juice. When the pudding is done and cooked somewhat spread 
the meringue over the top and brown it slightly. Serve hot without sauce. 

Batter Pudding. — ^This is an old-fashioned recipe, which can be 
depended upon. Measure 12 tablespoonfuls of flour after sifting; then 
sift again with a teaspoonful of baking powder and a small one of salt. 
Beat four eggs, without separating, until very light and before mixing 
them to a batter with a quart of milk, butter a three-pint oval baking 
dish and see that the oven is of a steady heat, as if for baking bread. 
Now make a smooth batter with the milk and flour, stirring in the eggs 
last, and bake about one hour The pudding will rise with a brown crust 
on top, and, by the slow baking, the sides and bottom will also be crisp 
and brown, while the interior will be tender and light. Serve directly 
from the oven, with fruit juice slightly thickened for sauce. No other 
sauce will take the place of this. When the supply of extra juice canned 
for this very purpose is exhausted, evaporated cherries soaked over night 
and well sjwinered in the same water is an excellent substitute. 



52 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Black Pudding. — One coffeecup black molasses, one coffeecup sour 
cream; add one dessertspoon of soda and beat hard and then add one 
cup chopped suet, one cup seeded raisins, a few almonds (about a table- 
spoonful), do not blanch them, as they will have a better flavor, three 
(or more if liked) chopped figs, two apples, and a piece of citron 
chopped. Three cups of flour, one-half teaspoonful of salt and the grat- 
ing of one- half nutmeg. Beat well. Take four baking powder cans 
(pound size), rub with melted butter and pour the batter into them and 
steam hard three hours. Stand in oven ten or fifteen minutes to dry off. 
When you wish to use steam half an hour. A quantity may be made at 
one time, as these puddings will keep six months. 

Blackberry Pudding. — Beat one-third of a cup of butter to a cream. 
Add gradually half a cup of sugar and the beaten yolks of two eggs. 
Sift together two cups of previously sifted flour, four level teaspoonfuls 
of baking powder and half a teaspoonful of salt. Add this to the 
creamed butter, sugar, and eggs. Put in half of the flour mixture, mix, 
and then put in half a cupful of cold water. Mix in the rest of the 
flour, etc. Beat thoroughly and last of all fold in the well-beaten whites 
of the two eggs. Sprinkle a cupful of blackberries with a little flour 
and add them to the batter as it is dropped a spoonful at a time, into the 
mold, which should be rubbed with unsalted butter. Steam an hour and 
a half, or bake twenty-five minutes, and serve with a blackberry hard 
sauce. The sauce is made in the usual way, with half a cup of butter 
and a cup of sugar. Add to this half a cupful of crushed berries. 

Blueberry Betty.— Put a pint of milk in a double boiler and put on 
the fire to scald. Pick over, wash and drain a pint of fresh blueberries. 
Have ready a pint of soft whole wheat bread crumbs. Put a layer of 
crumbs in a buttered pudding dish, 'then a layer of berries, then more 
crumbs and so on until the dish is full, having crumbs on top. Stir two 
tablespoonfuls of sugar in the milk, and when hot pour it over the con- 
tents of the dish. Cover and set in the oven to bake for about an hour. 
Stand the pudding dish in a basin of hot water. Serve with a tart sauce. 

Blueberry Pudding.— Beat ly, cupful sugar with four eggs, add one 
pint milk and one cupful flour, in which sift one tablespoonful baking 
powder, one-half teaspoonful salt; add one cupful whole blueberries; pour 
in a buttered covered mold; set in boiling water, letting water only 
come a little more than half way up to the mold; weight down and boil 
continuously for one hour; slip on to a dish and cover with sauce, then 
sprinkle over uncooked fruit. Sauce— Beat one cupful granulated sugar 
with one cupful butter to a cream; then add yolks of two eggs, one- 
quarter teaspoonful vanilla. 

Baked Blueberry Pudding.— One quart ripe, fresh berries, mace or 
nutmeg one-half teaspoonful; three eggs well beaten, separately; sugv,

53 

one 



two cups; cold butter, one tablespoon; sweet milk, one cup; flour, 

pint; baking powder, two teaspoons. Roll berries well in flour, add 
them last. Bake half hour and serve with sauce. Delicious. 

Steamed Blueberry PufTs.— Beat two eggs until light and thick, with- 
out separating; add half a cupful of sugar and half a cupful of milk; 
sfft together three level teaspoonfuls of baking powder, half a teaspoon- 
ful of salt and two cupfuls of flour, stir into the liquid ingredients; then 
stir in one cup of blueberries. Turn into buttered cups and steam half 
an hour. The batter should drop easily from the end of the spoon. 
Serve hot with cream and sugar. 

Bread and Butter Pudding.— Strew half a cupful of currants in the 
bottom of a baking dish, then butter some slices of freshly-baked bread 
and lay in the dish. Make a custard with two eggs and a pint of milk, 
sweeten to taste, and pour it over ; grate a little nutmeg over the top and 
bake a light brown. This pudding should be baked in the dish in which 
it is to be sent to table. It is delicious eaten with stewed fruit. 

Steamed Bread and Butter Pudding.— Butter a small pudding bowl. 
Cut some thin bread and butter, decorate the bottom of the basin with 
candied peel cut in stars, or a few raisins or preserved cherries; put in 
the slices of bread and butter, dusting each slice with sugar and sprinkling 
with a few chopped preserved cherries. When full beat up an egg with 
half a pint of milk, flavor with essence of almonds, and strain over the 
pudding. Leave to soak for a while, cover with buttered paper, and 
steam for an hour and a quarter. Turn out, and serve with custard. 

Bread Pudding in Disguise. — Break half a loaf of _ bread into pieces 
and soak in milk, just what the bread will take up. Then add an egg 
and a cup of sugar and a cup of rich, creamy milk in which put half 
teaspoonful of saleratus and teaspoonful of cream of tartar. Bake until 
light and well browned in a medium oven. To serve pour a little maple 
syrup over each dish. 

Brown Betty. — Mix a cupful of sugar and a level teaspoonful of 
cinnamon. Prepare about a quart of sliced tart apples. Stir into a pint 
of soft bread crumbs about half a cupful of melted butter. Butter well 
a deep pudding dish, put in a layer of crumbs, then sliced apples and 
sprinkle with sugar, then another layer of crumbs, apples and sugar and 
continue until the materials are used with a thick layer of crumbs on the 
top. Bake about an hour in a moderate oven. If the oven browns on 
the bottom set in a p*n of hot water or bake on the top grate of the oven, 
covering the pudding well to prevent too crisp an upper crust. Serve 
with hard sauce made as follows: Cream a third of a cupful of butter, 
add gradually a cupful of powdered sugar and when beaten to a cream 
add drop by drop to prevent separation, two tablespoonfuls of rich cream. 
Flavor with vanilla or. lemon juice. 



54 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Carrot Pudding.— Mix together one cupful of grated bread crumbs, 
a quarter of a pound each of flour and of butter, one-half pound of 
preserved cherries, and one-half pound of sugar and a saltspoonful of 
salt. Boil six young carrots until they are tender, then pass them 
through a sieve and add half a pound of this pulp to the other ingredi- 
ents. Stir the mixture well, then steam it in a buttered mold for 2^ 
hours. In the Winter we make an imitation plum pudding in which a 
cupful of grated carrot is used, the carrot both lightening and 
enriching it. 

Cherry Cups. — Measure a pint of sifted flour, add two teaspoonfuls 
of baking powder and half a teaspoonful of salt and sift again. Mix to 
a soft dough with cold water. Butter little custard cups and drop in a 
little of the dough and then add a teaspoonful of the cherries; cover 
these with more dough (the cups should not be more than half full). 
Set the cups in a steamer, or if you have no steamer you can put them 
in a deep baking pan with a little boiling water; cover closely with 
another pan and steam half an hour in' the oven. Eat with cherry sauce 
or sweetened cream. On bread baking day you can make these with 
bread dough instead of the baking powder dough. 

Cherry Batter Pudding. — Prepare a cupful of stoned cherries. Beat 
two eggs separately, add half a pint of milk, or better still, sweet cream, 
to the yolks, and to this one tablespoonful of melted butter. Have ready 
1J4 cupful of flour, into which two teaspoonfuls of baking powder have 
been sifted, with a dash of salt. Add this to the yolks of the eggs and 
milk, and lastly add the whites of the eggs, beaten light. Beat vigor- 
ously for a few minutes and turn into a greased baking pan, allowing the 
batter to be about an inch thick. Cover it with the cherries, add one-third 
of a cup of granulated sugar, sprinkled lightly on the top, and bake in a 
quick oven for 30 minutes. Serve hot with hard sauce or a sauce made 
from a cup of cherries and half a cup of sugar stewed together until the 
cherries are reduced to a pulp. Sauce as well as pudding should be 
served hot. 

Boiled Cherry Pudding. — Beat three eggs light without separating; add 
a pint of milk. Sift two teaspoonfuls of baking powder and a half a 
teaspoonful of salt in a little less than a quart of sifted flour and add the 
liquid gradually to the flour, stirring to a smooth batter. Add a teaspoon- 
ful of melted butter. Beat thoroughly and then stir in a pint of cherries, 
stoned and drained free from juice and well floure4. Turn into a well- 
buttered pudding dish or mold, or an old-fashioned pudding bag, scalded 
and floured, and cook in a kettle of boiling water for three hours. Keep 
the water boiling continually or the pudding will be heavy. If cooked 
in a mold or dish, the water must not be deep enough to boil over the 
pudding. If in a bag, there roust be sufficient water to keep the pudding 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 8S 

from touching the bottom of the kettle. Serve with hard or foamy sauce. 

Cherry Pudding in Winter.— Nearly fill a buttered baking dish with 
the sour canned cherries. Use just enough of the juice so the cherries 
will be moist. Spread over this a dough made from one-fourth teacupful 
sugar, one tablespoonful butter, one-half cupful milk, one egg, a little 
salt, one cupful flour (use a little more if necessary to make dough like 
cake), one teaspoonful baking powder. Bake half an hour. Sauce to 
serve with it is made as follows : One-half cupful butter^ one-half cupful 
sugar, one tablespoonful of flour or cornstarch. Mix thoroughly. To this 
add a pint of the cherry juice. Boil till it thickens. 

Canned Cherry Tapioca. — Cover a scant cupful of tapioca with cold 
water and let it soak over night. In the morning place over the fire with 
a saltspoonful of salt and a pint of boiling water; simmer slowly until 
the tapioca is perfectly clear. Stir a pint of stoned cherries into the 
boiling tapioca; add a cupful of sugar (more if the cherries are very 
sour) ; turn into a serving dish and set away to cool. Serve with 
whipped cream. 

Chocolate Pudding. — Put into a bowl two cupfuls of stale bread- 
crumbs. Pour over them one quart of scalded milk. While the bread 
and milk are cooling melt two squares of chocolate. Mix the chocolate 
with two-thirds of a cup of sugar, then, with two eggs, lightly beaten, one 
scant saltspoonful of salt and a teaspoonful of vanilla. Add the milk 
and breadcrumbs and then, when well mixed, turn the whole into a pud- 
ding dish that has been buttered and sugared. Bake it one hour in a 
moderately hot oven. Serve cold, with cream. This pudding can be 
baked in individual molds if preferred. 

Steamed Chocolate Pudding. — Boil one quart of fresh milk and pour 
over one pint grated bread crumbs, one-fourth cake grated chocolate, one 
cup sugar, one cup flour, one cup butter, two teaspoons baking powder, 
one cup raisins, one cup chopped nuts. Steam two hours and serve with 
a sauce. 

Chocolate Tapioca. — Soak three tablespoonfuls of tapioca in a cup of 
cold water for half an hour; add three pints of hot milk, one cupful of 
sugar, yolks of two eggs and three tablespoonfuls of grated chocolate. 
Cook in a double boiler until the tapioca is tender. Serve with a meringue 
made from the whites of two eggs and powdered sugar or whipped cream. 

Cider Pudding. — Mix a cupful of cider, a cupful of molasses, a cupful 
of suet, a cupful of seeded raisins, half a teaspoonful of salt, one tea- 
spoonful of soda and flour enough to make a stiff batter. Steam three 
hours. 

Baked Cider Pudding. — Cream 1^ tablespoonful butter, add three 
tablespoonfuls granulated sugar and one egg. Beat all together until 
very light. Add half 3 cupful of cider. Into one cup of flour put one- 



58 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

half teaspoonful cinnamon, one-quarter teaspoonful of ground cloves. 
Sift this into the batter and add a quarter cupful each of currants and 
Sultana raisins mixed with a quarter cupful of flour. Add one-quarter 
teaspoonful baking soda with the last bit of flour and beat briskly for 
a minute or two. Pour into a well-greased mold and steam one hour 
and a half; turn out carefully, as the texture is delicate, and serve hot 
with orange sauce. 

Cider Bread Pudding. — Butter freely several slices of light bread. 
Place a layer in pudding dish, cover with a few slices of tart apples; 
repeat until the dish is full. To a quart of good cider add a cup of 
sugar and pour over. Bake slowly and serve either hot or cold with 
cream. 

Citron Pudding. — A quart of fresh milk, a pint of stale bread crumbs, 
carefully grated, four eggs, a coffee cup of powdered sugar, half a pound 
of citron cut fine, a small amount of butter and the juice and rind of 
one lemon. The yolks and sugar are beaten together and the bread 
crumbs, milk and lemon rind added by degrees. This is poured into a 
buttered dish, the citron dropped in and a piece of butter placed over 
all. The baking required half an hour and the preparation when cold 
is covered with a meringue made of four whites, a cup of powdered 
sugar and the juice of a lemon. This is browned slightly before serving. 

Cocoanut Pudding. — One-half cupful of cocoanut, one-half cupful of 
bread crumbs, one pint of milk, one egg, one tablespoonful of butter, 
two tablespoonfuls of sugar and one level saltspoonful of salt. Soak 
the bread crumbs and cocoanut in the milk for three hours ; mash the 
bread fine, and add the sugar, salt and melted butter. Beat the white 
and yolk of the egg separately, and add first the yolk and then the white, 
stirring well. Place all in a well-buttered pudding dish and bake half 
an hour. Serve hot without sauce. 

CoflFee Pudding. — Boil three-fourths of a cup of ground coffee in 
one quart water 10 minutes ; then add one-half ounce gelatine which 
had been soaked 15 minutes ; then add one cup sugar ; boil one minute ; 
then strain through a cloth, set aside to get cold; when almost jellied 
beat one-half pint cream till near stiff, then add the coffee jelly, gradu- 
ally beating all the time. When all is well mixed flavor with vanilla, 
and set in a cold place to harden. It can be served alone, or with cream. 
The recipe is enough for six people. 

Colonial Pudding. — When baking bread put a piece of the dough into 
a pound baking powder tin and bake this for the top of the pudding. 
Soak some slices of Boston brown bread in scalded milk for two hours. 
Then beat up well, add a cupful of raisins, a little chopped mixed peel, 
half a teaspoonful of mixed spice, half a cupful of sugar, and two ounces 
of beef suet, chopped very fine, or a piece of butter the size of an egg. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 57 

Mix all well together, adding cold milk as you mix it, and then put into 
a buttered baking dish. A lound, shallow dish is the best to use, and 
it should also be one that can be sent to the table. Now cut the white 
bread into slices, butter them, and lay them closely together on the top 
of the pudding mixture. Grate a little nutmeg over all, and bake in a 
moderate oven for an hour and a half, covering it for an hour and 
taking off the cover for the half hour so that it may be a nice light brown. 

Cottage Pudding. — One cup sugar, two eggs, one pint sweet milk, two 
scant teaspoons baking powder, flavoring and flour to make a batter as 
stiff as cake dough. Bake three-quarters of an hour in a moderate 
oven and serve with milk or hot sauce. To make hot sauce cream 
together one tablespoon butter and two of flour with half cup of sugar. 
Slowly add enough boiling water to make it thin and smooth. Then 
proceed to add boiling water to make it the consistency of thin starch. 
Boil a few minutes and flavor before serving. 

Steamed Cranberry Dumplings. — Make the dumplings of good, pre- 
pared flour, which cannot fail to be light, using one pint of it; add a 
pinch of salt and mix with milk to a paste just stiff enough to drop by 
tablespoonfuls on the buttered steamer bottom; steam over boiling water 
about half an hour. Serve immediately; first carefully split the fluffy 
rolls open, lightly butter and put between a tablespoonful of stewed cran- 
berry sauce (warm) ; pour over a foamy sauce made as follows: Three 
tablespoonfuls of milk, stirred into one beaten egg, a half cupful of sugar 
and one teaspoonful of flour; beat hard and put into double boiler; pour 
on slowly a cup of boiling water, stir constantly until the sauce thickens, 
then add one teaspoonful of butter and one of strawberry flavoring. 

Cranberry Pot-pie. — Butter a porcelain stewpan or kettle; put in a 
pint of berries, sprinkled with one cupful sugar; make a pint of biscuit 
dough, shape into a large ring and lay on the fruit in the kettle; then 
pour another pint of berries into and around the cup of dough, adding 
another cupful of sugar; pour one pint of boiling water into the center, 
cover closely and stew steadily for 20 minutes. When done turn from 
the kettle on to a platter; serve with cream and sugar. 

Cranberry Pudding. — Sift and measure one pint of flour; add two 
teaspoonfuls baking powder and half a teaspoonful of salt. Sift again 
until all are thoroughly blended. Add enough sweet milk to make a 
soft batter. Stir in one cup of cranberries that have been coarsely 
chopped. Pour into a pudding bag or a porcelain-lined mold. If the bag 
is used boil one and one-half hour in plenty of water. If the mold is used, 
steam the pudding, two hours. 

Baked Cranberry Pudding.— Put a layer of coarsely crumbled bread in 
bottom of buttered dish; then a layer of seeded raisins and stewed cran- 
berries, a few bits of butter, and a few drops of vanilla extract; repeat 



58 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

bread, butter, vanilla and fruit until dish is full; have crumbs and but- 
ter top layer; bake until puffy and brown; then decorate with meringue 
and place in very moderate oven to set the latter, but not brown. 

Cream Curds.— Beat four eggs and stir them into a quart of milk 
slightly warmed. New milk was originally called for. Add a little salt 
and turn the mixture into a covered earthen pot. A bean pot or cas- 
serole will answer. Set the pot in a pan of warm water over the fire. 
As soon as the milk cracks turn it carefully out on a sieve covered with 
a linen cloth. When the draining is complete put the curds in a glass 
dish in large spoonfuls. 

Cup Custards.— In making cup custards, it is a pleasant change to 
put in each cup, before the custard is poured in, a tablespoonful of 
either strawberry or raspberry jam. The custard cups should be stood 
in a baking pan containing hot water while baking; every custard should 
be cooked in this way. A dale custard is made and baked in the ordi- 
nary manner; then, after baking, the top is covered with stoned dates, 
which may be filled with nuts if desired, and rolled in powdered sugar. 
The dates are covered with a meringue, which is browned in the oven, 
and the custard is then served cold. 

Peach Custard. — Slice ripe peaches in a glass dish and sugar them 
well two hours before they are to be served. Make a boiled custard by 
taking three eggs, one and one-half pints sweet milk and one tablespoon 
corn starch and one cup of sugar. Boil after thoroughly beating together 
in a double boiler till thick and smooth. Pour over peaches and serve 
while slightly warm. 

Date Puffs. — Two eggs, one cupful of sugar, one quarter of a cupful 
of butter, the same of milk, one teaspoonful of baking powder and flour 
enough to make a thin batter. Stir in one cupful of stoned dates; fill 
muffin cups half full and steam 30 minutes. Serve with a liquid sauce 
or with sweetened cream. 

Economy Pudding. — Take two cupfuls of ginger cookie crumbi 
(crumbled cookies) and one cupful sweet milk, one cupful molasses, one 
teaspoonful cinnamon, one-fourth teaspoonful cloves, one-fourth tea- 
spoonful nutmeg, three eggs well beaten, one-half teaspoonful salt, one 
cup seeded raisins, one-half teaspoonful of soda dissolved in one table- 
spoonful of water and two cupfuls of flour. Beat thoroughly, turn into 
greased pudding pan and steam three hours. Serve with hard sauce. 

Farina Pudding. — Place a double boiler with one pint of milk over 
the fire; when it boils, sprinkle in two and a half tablespoonfuls farina, 
one-quarter teaspoonful salt and two tablespoonfuls sugar. Cook 
twenty minutes, then add the beaten whites of two eggs, stir for a few 
minutes, remove from fire, pour into a mold and set aside to cool. 
Serve with orange sauce made in following manner: Stir the yolki ot

two eggs with half cupful sugar to a cream, add half cupful orange 
juice and one tablespoonful lemon juice, add last the beaten white of one 
egg and serve. Or a vanilla sauce may be served with the pudding. 

Fruit Puffs. — Fill old cups or baking cans to the depth of two inches 
with strawberries, sliced apples, or any kind of berries and cover with a 
layer of sugar. Put in each cup a small lump of butter and completely 
cover the berries with a batter made of one egg, one pint sweet milk, 
one and one-half teaspoon baking powder and flour to make rather stiffer 
than for pancakes. Bake 40 minutes in a steady oven. 

Gingerbread Pudding. — One cupful of molasses, one cupful of sugar, 
one-half cupful of melted lard or butter, salt; all kinds of spice — one- 
fourth teaspoonful of each— one cupful of buttermilk, two scant tea- 
spoonfuls of soda, one cupful of raisins or sliced apples, flour for stiff 
batter. Steam in a covered pudding dish two hours. Hot water may 
be substituted for buttermilk; then use half the quantity of soda. 
Whipped cream is better than sugar with this. 

Gooseberry Charlotte. — Stew a pint of ripe or nearly ripe gooseberries 
for 10 minutes very slowly, not to break them. Cut six or eight slices 
of stale plain cake; line the bottom of your pudding dish with them; 
put next a layer of the gooseberries sprinkled thickly with sugar; more 
cake, more berries, and so on until the dish is full. Cover closely and 
steam in a moderate oven 20 or 25 minutes. You will find the juice of 
the berries sufficient moisture. Serve hot with a good pudding sauce. 

Gooseberry Fool. — According to the original English recipe it was 
merely gooseberry sauce enriched with cream; American authorities, how- 
ever, use eggs and butter instead of cream. To make it English fashion, 
stew either green or ripe gooseberries, after topping and stemming them, 
until tender, in just enough water to prevent burning, strain through a 
sieve, sweeten and then stir in as much rich cream as taste dictates; 
pour into a glass dish, and set away in a cool place. A very delicious 
dessert is made by using this gooseberry fool as filling for charlottes, 
lining either one large mold or small individual cups with ladies' fingers 
or small slices of sponge cake, and then filling with the gooseberry mix- 
ture, putting whipped cream on the top. The American recipe adds to 
one quart of ripe gooseberries, stewed and strained, the yolks of four 
eggs, one cupful of sugar, and one tablespoonful of butter, beaten to- 
gether until light. Pour into a glass dish, and heap on top the whites 
of the eggs, beaten with two tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar. 

Gooseberry Pudding. — Green gooseberries mixed with rhubarb make 
a nice combination for pie or puddings. Of course plenty of sugar is 
needed. For gooseberry pudding line a mold with baking powder or suet 
crust (preferably the latter); fill with gooseberries alone or mixed with 
rhubarb, sugar liberally, add a little water, and cover; steam three hour*.

Graham Pudding.— Make a batter of a cupful of molasses, a cupful 
Df sweet milk, a cupful of seeded and chopped raisins, two cupfuls of 
graham flour and two teaspoonfuls of soda. Steam for three hours. 
Eat with a sauce made of a tablespoonful of butter creamed with half 
a cupful of sugar and the stiffly beaten white of an egg and lemon to 
flavor. 

Graham Date Pudding.— Stone a cupful of dates and add them to a 
pint of boiling water, two tablespoonfuls of sugar and a pinch of salt. 
Set on the fire and stir in graham flour to make a moderately thick por- 
ridge. Cook thoroughly, set away to get cold. Serve with whipped cream. 

Graham Plum Pudding.— One egg, one cup molasses, one cup sweet 
milk, one teaspoonful soda, one-half teaspoonful salt, two cupfuls gra- 
ham flour, one-half cupful raisins. Mix and steam three hours. Serve 
with this sauce: One tablespoonful butter, one tablespoonful sugar, one 
tablespoonful white flour, the yolk of one egg. Add hot water and let 
it boil, then white of egg and flavor. 

Grape Pudding. — Soak one-half a box of gelatine in one-half a cup 
of cold water, until soft; add one cup of boiling water, juice of one 
lemon, one cup of sugar and one pint of grape juice. Set aside to cool 
until it begins to stiffen, then fold in the stiffly beaten whites of two 
eggs. Run into a mold. When ready to serve unmold and garnish with 
whipped cream. A bunch of grapes may be placed on the top of the 
mold. This will serve eight persons. 

Grape Pudding No. 2. — This is an old-fashioned dish which may be 
either boiled or baked. Delaware grapes are best for it. Wash, pick 
and flour well before putting into the batter. A heaping pint of picked- 
grapes makes a fair-sized pudding. For the batter beat four eggs very 
light, whites and yolks separate, mix smoothly with the yolks half a 
pint of milk and one pint of flour sifted twice. Add half a cupful of 
butter beaten to a cream, and last of all the whites of eggs, stirring them 
in with long, swift strokes, all the same way. The grapes go in at the 
very last, and the bag or the pan ought to be ready before they are 
added. Boil the pudding three hours, and serve with a rich grape juice 
sauce. For a baked pudding the white of one egg may be kept out, and 
used for a meringue. Serve with the same sauce. 

Huckleberry Blanc Mange. — Heat one quart of milk in a double boiler 
(reserving one-third of a cupful with which to mix three tablespoonfuls 
of cornstarch). Add one-half cupful of sugar and a pinch of salt. 
When the milk is scalding hot, stir in the cornstarch, and cook for five 
minutes. Pour this on the well-beaten whites of two eggs and beat 
thoroughly. When cool pour a little of it into a wetted mold, strew 
over this fresh blueberries, then another portion of the blanc mange, 
then more of the blueberries (using a pint in all), finish with the blanc

mange and set on ice to harden. When ready to serve turn out on a 
flat glass or china jelly plate and serve with either whipped or plain 
cream, slightly sweetened. 

Huckleberry Pudding.— Ingredients : One pint of New Orleans mo- 
lasses, a quart of huckleberries, a teaspoonful of baking soda, a teaspoon- 
ful each of powdered cinnamon, ginger and cloves and 1'/^ teacupful of 
flour. Put the molasses in a bowl, dissolve soda in a little water and 
stir in molasses; add spice, fruit and flour and pour the mixture in the 
pudding mold. Tie the lid on and set it in a pot of boiling water for 
three hours. 

Huckleberry Indian Pudding. — Mix together two quarts of warm milk, 
three-fourths cupful finely-chopped suet, two tablespoonfuls molasses, a 
half teaspoonful of soda, a teaspoonful of salt and enough Indian meal 
to make a stiff batter. Add at the last two eggs, whites and yolks 
beaten separately, and a quart of huckleberries dredged with flour. Boil 
for two and one-half hours in a buttered bag or mold, never allowing 
the water to stop boiling, and serve hot with foamy sauce. 

Hulnah Pudding. — Wash a cupful of rice and add to it a quart of 
milk, a cupful of sugar and a teaspoonful of cornstarch dissolved in a 
little cold milk. Flavor with quarter of a nutmeg grated. Bake an hour 
and a half, stirring down occasionally, but do not stir down the skin 
which forms on top ; then let it brown. When done take from the oven, 
remove the brown skin and when the pudding is cool lay over the top 
preserved strawberries or cherries. Make a meringue with the whites 
of three eggs and three tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar, and heap 
over the top of the fruit. Set in the oven a moment to brown a delicate 
color. Eat with cream. 

Indian Pudding. — One pint of skim-raiWa scalded. While hot stir in 
smoothly two cupfuls of Indian meal, add a little salt, a teaspoonful 
of cinnamon and half a cupful of molasses, also the same of sugar. 
Stir well. Now add a quart of cold skim-milk, and mix lightly as pos- 
sible. Bake slowly for two hours. Your finished product will be fra- 
grant, rich, golden, trembling in its sweet jellied whey. Now add the 
last touch. When you serve it, put a heaping spoonful of nice apple 
sauce flavored with nutmeg over the top, and if you like another spoon- 
ful of whipped cream over that. 

Indian Apple Pudding. — Take one-half of a cup of molasses, one quart 
of milk, one teaspoonful of salt, three scant cups of pared and sliced 
apples, to which add a quarter of a teaspoonful of ginger and cinna- 
mon. When the milk boils in the double boiler, pour it slowly on the 
meal. Cook half an hour in the boiler, stirring often. Now add the 
other ingredients; pour into a deep, well greased pudding dish and bake 
fclowly. Eat with cream or maple syrup. _ 



«3 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Boiled Indian Pudding. — One cupful of milk, one cupful of com meal, 
one egg, one tablespoonful of sugar, one tablespoonful of beef suet 
minced fine and strings removed, one-half teaspoonful each of salt and 
ground cinnamon, one-third saltspoonful of soda in the milk. (Sour milk 
may be used, in which case take one-half teaspoonful of soda.) Heat 
the milk with the soda ; when boiling stir in the meal, salt and suet and 
set aside to cool. When cold beat in the spice, sugar and whipped 
eggs and stir vigorously. Boil in a well-greased brown bread mold for 
three hours. Leave plenty of room for the pudding to swell. Serve 
with hard sauce or caramel, maple sugar or molasses. The recipe may 
be doubled and divided in two molds for steaming — one to be set aside 
in a cool place and used in a week. A cupful of chopped, floured rai- 
sins, dates, or cooked dried apricots may be added. For molasses sauce, 
use one cupful of molasses, one and a half tablespoonful of butter, two 
tablespoonfuls of lemon juice, a dash each of nutmeg and cinnamon. 
Boil molasses, spices and butter five minutes, remove from fire and add 
lemon juice. Serve very hot. 

New England Indian Pudding. — Take one pint of milk, scald it and 
pour it over two heaping tablespoonfuls of Indian meal, in which a 
saltspoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful of cinnamon, one-quarter of a 
whole nutmeg grated, have been blended. Stir briskly, and when per- 
fectly smooth add one-third cup of chopped suet, one-third cup of mo- 
lasses; when this is well mixed add one pint of cold milk. Beat well, 
turn into a greased dish, set it in another containing warm water and 
bake three hours in a moderate oven. Serve hot with hard sauce. 
This pudding will look as if it had cream and eggs in it, and it should 
be stirred gently three times during the first hour and a half. 

Old-JFashioned Indian Pudding.— One quart of milk, one quart of 
Indian meal, three eggs, three heaping tablespoonfuls of sugar, one tea- 
spoonful of salt and one-half pound of beef suet chopped into powder. 
Scald the milk and while boiling hot stir in the meal and suet with the 
salt. When cold, add the yolks, beaten light with the sugar, then the 
whites. Dip your bag in hot water, flour it and fill half full with the 
mixture, as it will swell very much. Boil five hours. Eat very hot, 
with butter and sugar. This pudding is even better when baked in a 
well-buttered dish for an hour and a half. Bake, covered, for an hour 
and a quarter, then brown. 

Kenilworth Pudding.— Two cupfuls of light chopped bread, one-half 
cupful chopped suet, taking care to free it from all strings, one-half 
cupful of molasses, one egg, one cupful raisins, seeded or the seedless, 
one cupful sweet milk, with one-half teaspoonful soda dissolved in it! 
one-half teaspoonful powdered cloves, one teaspoonful cinnamon and • 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 63 

pinch of mace and salt. Mix thoroughly and boil two hours in a tin 
pudding dish. Eat with foamy sauce. 

Lemon Pudding.— Grate the rinds of two lemons and squeeze over 
them the juice to keep moist. Beat together two eggs, one and one- 
half cups sugar, two tablespoons cornstarch or flour, tablespoon butter 
and enough cold water to thoroughly moisten. Place in double boiler 
and add one and one-half pint boiling water, stirring till the mass is 
smooth and thick. Just before removing from fire add the rind and 
juice of the lemons and beat thoroughly. Cover with a meringue made 
of one white of egg and two tablespoons of sugar and then slightly 
brown in the oven. 

Maple Custard. — Scald one pint of rich milk in a double boiler and 
when hot add a tablespoonful of cornstarch mixed with one-third of a 
cupful of cold milk. Just before taking from the fire add two table- 
spoonfuls of fine-shaved maple sugar and the beaten yolks of three eggs. 
Stir until smooth, adding when cool a pinch of salt and half a tea- 
spoonful of vanilla. Use whites of the eggs with sugar for frosting. 
By including whites of eggs in the custard and omitting the cornstarch 
a delicious cup-custard can be made. 

Molasses Bread Pudding. — Stir into one quart of milk one pint of 
bread crumbs, one cup of molasses, one cup of raisins, seeded, cinna- 
mon and nutmeg to flavor. Bake in a slow oven for three hours, stir- 
ring a little when first heated. Serve hot with cream. 

Peach Roll. — Into four cups of flour sift two teaspoons of baking 
powder, add two cups sour cream, one teaspoon soda and a pinch of 
salt. Roll out thin and cover with canned peaches which have been 
drained from the juice. Sprinkle with sugar. Cut the dough into strips 
and roll up. Bake or steam one-half hour. If baked, pour a little 
water into the pan. Serve with the reserved juice or with cream and 
sugar. 

Peach Tapioca. — Soak one-half cupful of tapioca over night in plenty 
of cold water. Cover the bottom of a buttered pudding dish with a 
layer of canned peaches, pour over this the tapioca, which has been 
sweetened with one tablespoonful of sugar, put over this another layer 
of the peaches and bake in a moderate oven for half an hour. Beat the 
whites of two eggs until very stiff, add two tablespoonfuls of sugar, 
spread this over the peaches and return to the oven until a delicate 
brown. Add more sugar to the juice left from the canned peaches, beat 
one-half cupful of cream until light, pour gradually over it the peach 
juice, beat all together and serve with dessert. This dish is good served 
either cold or hot. 

Pear Charlotte. — Slightly moisten six slices of stale bread with cold 
water, spread them with soft butter, put half of them in the bottom of 



64 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

a buttered pudding dish, spread over them two cupfuls of -finely chopped 
ripe pears and sprinkle with four tablespoonfuls of sugar, a grating of 
nutmeg and a tablespoonful of lemon juice. Lay over them the re- 
mainder of the bread, another two cupfuls of the chopped pears and 
nutmeg, sugar and lemon juice as before. Pour over one cupful of thin 
maple syrup, cover closely and bake in a slow oven for one hour. Serve 
hot with whipped cream or maple syrup. 

Pear Pudding. — Put one quart of canned pears into a baking dish; 
add a finger length of stick cinnamon and three cloves. If the pears 
have not been sweetened sufficiently when put up add sugar to make 
them quite sweet, teaspoonful of butter and dredge a teaspoonful of 
flour over the top. Place the dish on the range where it will heat while 
you mix a pint of flour- into a biscuit dough according to well-known 
directions ; make a very soft dough ; pat into shape with the hands and 
cover the pears. Bake about 25 minutes. There should be rich juice 
enough to moisten the crust. If preferred it may have plain cream 
served with it. 

Persimmon Pudding. — One quart of persimmons mashed fine with the 
hands, and every seed removed. Add one quart of sweet milk, one egg, 
one tablespoonful of butter, one-half teaspoonful each of cinnamon, nut- 
meg and ginger, and half as much of allspice and cloves, half cupful of 
sugar. Pour into a buttered baking dish, and bake till well set, as if for 
custard. Eat hot or cold; delicious either way. 

Ejiglish Plum Pudding. — ^One pound stoned raisins; one pound of 
suet, chopped fine; J^ pound of stale bread crumbs; one- fourth pound 
of brown sugar; grated rind of one lemon; % pound of flour; one 
pound cleaned currants ; yi nutmeg, grated ; five eggs ; one cup milk ; 
one-half pound chopped candied peel. Mix all the dry ingredients ; then 
beat the eggs, add the milk to them, pour over the other materials, and 
mix well; it will require very hard stirring, as it is stiff. Put in 
greased molds holding one quart each, cover with well-floured cloth, and 
boil for six hours. Store away, and when used boil for six hours more. 

Plum Pudding. — Fill a deep baking pan to the depth of two inches 
with seeded plums, well sugared. Dot with bits of butter and put over 
the top a thick, good light biscuit crust with holes for the steam to 
escape. Bake 40 minutes and serve with the juice from canned plums 
or cream. This is good pudding when canning is going on to use up 
the surplus juice. Seeded grapes, peaches, apples or cherries may be 
used instead of plums. 

Plum Roll. — Sift together one pint of flour, one teaspoonful of bak- 
ing powder and one-half teaspoonful of salt; rub into the prepared flour 
one tablespoonful of butter and make into soft dough with milk or 
water; roll out quite thin, sprinkle with one cup of seeded chopped rai- 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 65 

sms, one-fourth of a cup of chopped citron and half^a teaspoonful of 
cinnamon; roll up and steam for 40 minutes; serve hot, with hard sauce. 

Poor Man's Pudding.— One cupful sour milk, one cupful of mo- 
lasses, one cupful of cold water, two cupfuls Indian meal, half a cup of 
butter, one egg, one teaspoonful of soda, one teaspoonful of cinnamon, 
one saltspoonful of salt. Beat all together thoroughly. Pour into a 
greased pudding pan and bake two hours in a moderately hot oven. 

Poverty Pudding.— Chop one cup of suet very fine; stone one cup 
of raisins; add one cup of molasses to the suet; then add milk, one 
cupful; add one-half teaspoonful of salt, three cupfuls of sifted flour 
and one teaspoonful of cinnamon; beat hard for three minutes; add 
raisins well floured and three level teaspoonfuls of baking powder; turn 
into a greased mold and boil three hours; serve with hard sauce. 

Prune Sago. — After washing one-half pound of prunes put them to 
soak till well puffed out, then put them into a stewpan with enough cold 
water to cover them. Cook till soft; pass the fruit through a fine sieve, 
after stoning it. Mix with it some pearl sago that has been well boiled. 
There should be equal quantities of fruit pulp and sago. Heat up, but 
do not boil ; if too stiff thin with a little milk or water, season with 
lemon juice; it will be sweet enough for ordinary palates. Pour into a 
jelly mold and when cold turn on a glass dish. Serve with whipped 
cream or boiled custard. 

Pumpkin Custard.- — One quart of hot milk, a large cup of strained 
squash or pumpkin, a teaspoonful of butter and one of salt, a cupful of 
sugar in which half a teaspoonful of cinnamon and a pinch of ginger 
have been mixed, and three eggs beaten light. Mix pumpkin and milk, 
add other ingredients, the eggs last, pour into custard cups which must 
be set in a pan of hot water. Bake until firm, about half an hour, testing 
with a knife blade. If it comes out clean they are done. Serve ice-cold. 

Queen's Pudding. — Take about a quart of good, rich, sweet milk, and 
half a pint of bread crumbs, minus the crust. Milk and bread are scalded 
together, and cooled enough to work through the colander. In this 
way the bread is worked smooth, and is thoroughly mixed with the milk. 
To this mixture are added the yolks of four eggs and the whites of two, 
about two-thirds of a cup of sugar, and one spoonful of butter. Beat 
the ingredients together very thoroughly, for the success of the pudding 
depends much on the beating. Flavor with nutmeg. Bake it in a very 
moderately hot oven, like a custard pie, which should never come to a 
boil. When baked, beat the whites of two eggs to a stiff froth and add 
three or four spoonfuls of granulated sugar for the frosting. Spread a 
good layer of jelly upon the pudding, and over this spread the frosting, 
and set in the oven till it browns, which takes but a very few minutes 
if the oven is hot. To be eaten with cream and sugar. 



66 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Raisin Steamed Pudding.— Blend a piece of butter the size of an egg 
with one cupful of sugar, to this add one beaten egg, half a cupful of 
milk, two teaspoonfuls of baking powder, sifted with two cupfuls of 
flour, and one cupful of seeded raisins dredged in flour. Fill cups par- 
tially full with the batter and steam three-quarters of an hour. Serve 
either with boiled sauce or sweetened cream. 

Baked Raspberry Pudding.— Line a small pudding dish with rich puff 
paste and prick with a fork. Bake a light brown and set it aside until 
cold. Beat very light the whites of four eggs, add slowly one cup of 
sugar, and lastly stir in a quart of red raspberries. Heap this lightly into 
the cooked shell in the pudding dish, return to the oven and bake 15 
to 20 minutes. Have the oven just moderately hot. 

Boiled Raspberry Pudding. — Open a can of canned or preserved rasp- 
berries and drain off the liquor, saving it for sauce for the pudding. 
Make a rich biscuit dough ; roll this- into a sheet a half inch thick, 
spread - thickly with the berries, sprinkle bits of butter over these and 
roll up the sheet of dough as yoti would a sheet of music. Put into a 
floured cloth and boil for three hours. Add to the raspberry liquor a 
little sugar and boil tip once. Take the pudding from the cloth, lay on 
a dish and pour the steaming sauce over it. 

Red Pudding. — A pint of red currants, a pint of raspberries, and a 
pint of cold water; mix, and add sugar to taste. Thus, if a rather sour 
pudding is desired, two teacupfuls of sugar will be sufficient to sweeten 
these ingredients, but if, on the other hand, it is a sweeter pudding that 
is required, the amount of sugar must be increased correspondingly. To 
this mixture add cinnamon — two sticks, each about three inches in length 
will be suflScient — already broken into bits, and when all these ingre- 
dients have boiled together for half an hour in a porcelain-lined stew- 
pan, press the juice through a sieve into another receptacle, and, adding 
a teacupful of blanched almonds and citron that have been chopped finely 
together, cook again for another 20 minutes. When nearly done, thicken 
with cornstarch. Set aside in a wet mold until it has had time to be- 
come hard; then serve it in slices covered thickly with rich cream. 

Rice Pudding. — Have one pint of rice boiled done and still hot. Into 
this stir one cup of raisins to swell and begin cooking in the hot mass. 
When nearly cold beat together three eggs, one quart of milk, one cup 
sugar and vanilla to taste. Add the rice and raisins, stirring till smooth 
and free from lumps. This pudding will have a delicious thick custard 
on top of the layer of rice if properly made and is better than the old 
style of nearly solid pudding. Bake one hour and serve with sweet milk. 

Lemon Rice Pudding. — Boil a cup of well washed rice in a quart of 
milk until very soft. Add to ii while hot the beaten yoIks of three eggs, 
the juice and grated rind of two lemons, eight tablespoonfuls of sugar 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 67 

and a pinch of salt. If too thick, add a little milk. It should be rather 
thicker than boiled custard. Turn it into a pudding dish, beat the 
whites of the eggs very stiff with six tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar, 
spread over the top and brown delicately in a slow oven. 

Rhubarb Cobbler.— Fill a deep, buttered, earthenware pie dish with 
rhubarb cut into pieces an inch long. Make a batter of eggs, flour, milk 
and salt, allowing a large tablespoonful of flour to each egg and milk 
enough to make a batter thick as for fritter batter. Pour this over the 
rhubarb and bake until the pudding is light and nicely browned. 

Rhubarb Puffs. — One cupful of finely chopped rhubarb, one cupful 
of sugar, two^ tablespoonfuls of butter creamed with the sugar, add two 
well-beaten eggs, one-quarter of a cup of milk, flour with one teaspoonful 
of baking powder well mixed into it, to make a thick batter. Fill well- 
greased cups half full and steam for half an hour. The sauce to serve 
with these puffs is made by creaming together one-half cupful of pow- 
dered sugar and a small half cupful of butter, then add by degrees one 
whipped egg, beating until perfectly smooth. The last thing before serv- 
ing stir in three tablespoonfuls of boiling water. 

Boiled Rhubarb Pudding. — Make three cups of flour into dough as 
for baking powder biscuit. Roll one-fourth inch thick; cover with rhu- 
barb that has been cut in inch pieces and scalded. Wipe dry before 
spreading on the crust. Sprinkle liberally with sugar and add a dash 
of nutmeg if desired. Make a roll of the dough and cook in steamer, 
or tie up in floured cloth and drop in boiling water. Cook 30 to 45 
minutes; serve with foamy sauce. 

Rhubarb Bread Pudding. — Peel the rhubarb and cut it into small 
pieces. Cover the bottom of a pudding dish with pieces of buttered 
bread. Over this put a layer of rhubarb. Pour over it a half-teaspoon- 
ful of lemon juice, and cover liberally with sugar. Add another layer of 
bread and butter, rhubarb, lemon and sugar. Repeat until the dish is 
full, covering the last layer of rhubarb with well-buttered bread crumbs. 
Cover the dish, and steam for one hour. Then remove the lid and bake 
it slowly until it is nicely browned. 

Rhubarb Tapioca. — Prepare the rhubarb as for stewing; place in a 
deep baking dish and add sugar enough to sweeten well, a little shredded 
orange peel, salt and dot with bits of butter. Add one quart of water 
to half a cupful of fine tapioca. Add a pinch of salt and cook in a 
double boiler for 15 minutes. Then pour over the rhubarb, cover the 
dish and bake half an hour. Serve with sweetened whipped cream. 

Sour Milk Pudding. — Soak four slices of stale bread in a little milk 
or water until soft. Then stir in a quart of rich, sour milk, a cupful 
of molasses, a tablespoonful of melte-d butter, a teaspoonful each of 
cloves and cinnamon, saltspoonful of salt. Bake slowly three hours. 



68 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Steamed .Pudding. — One cupful molasses, one egg, one cupful hot 
water, one teaspoonful saleratus, one tablespoonful butter, one cupful 
raisins, stoned, a little salt, flour enough to make stiff as cake, steam 
two hours. With this -pudding use the following sauce which is de- 
licious : Cream until very light one cupful of brown sugar, and nearly 
cne-half cupful butter, a little salt, and one-fourth teaspoonful of va- 
nilla. Just before serving beat in the unbeaten white of one egg. 

Strawberry Dumplings. — They will require one egg, a cup of sweet 
milk, a tablespoonful of melted butter, a heaping teaspoonful of baking 
powder, and flour enough to make a batter that will be a trifle thicker 
than that which is commonly used for griddle cakes. Pour a little of 
this batter into biittered tins, or porcelain cups ; place a number of well- 
sweetened berries in the center and cover them with more batter; then 
steam for about half an hour. Serve with a sauce made by mashing 
some strawberries and incorporating them into an ordinary hard butter- 
and-sugar sauce. 

Strawberry Pudding. — One cup cleaned strawberries, place in an 
earthen bowl, set in steamer over a pot of cold water, place over the fire; 
while this is heating and coming to a boil make a batter of the follow- 
ing: One heaping cup of flour with two heaping teaspoonfuls of baking 
powder and one-half teaspoonful of salt; sift all together two or three 
times, then add sweet milk or water to make a soft batter that will drop 
easily from spoon. Lift the lid of steamer and drop quickly over the 
strawberries, covering them all over nicely. Steam for 40 minutes; do 
not let the water stop boiling. This quantity makes enough pudding 
for four persons. Eat either with cream and sugar or a sauce made as 
follows : Break one egg in a dish, add one heaping tablespoonful of 
granulated sugar, beat light, then add dessertspoonful of flour and a 
pinch of salt; beat well again; then add slowly boiling water until the 
sauce is of the required thickness (about like nice cream) ; flavor to 
taste. This sauce is very nice with any kind of .pudding, especially cot- 
tage pudding. 

Sweet Potato Pudding. — One quart grated raw sweet potato, one 
quart milk, three eggs, two cupfuls sugar, piece of butter the size of an 
egg, one-half teaspoonful of salt, cinnamon and allspice to taste. Mix 
well, put in a buttered earthen pudding dish, and bake two hours in a 
moderate oven. 

Steamed Sweet Potato Pudding.— Take two cupfuls of grated raw 
potatoes, one cupful of grated carrots, two cupfuls of currants, one 
cupful of raisins stoned and chopped, one cupful of minced suet, one cup- 
ful of sugar, one teaspoonful each of salt and soda, and flour enough 
to make a stiff batter. Place in a greased mold and steam two hours. 
Serve with boiled sauce. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 69 

Suet Pudding.— One cupful molasses, one cupful beef suet chopped 
fine, one cupful sour milk, one teaspoonful saleratus, one cupful stoned 
raisins, one-half teaspoonful salt, four cupfuls flour. Mix thoroughly. 
Put in a buttered basin in the steamer over a kettle of boiling water. 
Steam for four hours. Do not disturb while steaming; at least not for 
the first hour. 

French Tapioca Pudding. — Scald one pint of milk over hot water. 
Stir in one-third of a cup of a quick cooking tapioca, mixed with a 
few grains of salt and one-fourth a cup of sugar. Stir and cook about 
ten minutes, then add very gradually to three eggs (or two whole eggs 
and the whites of two more), beaten very light and thick. Also add a 
grating of lemon rind and a tablespoonful of butter. Turn into a tur- 
ban-shaped mold, thoroughly buttered and dusted with sugar, and bake, 
standing in a pan of water, one hour. Serve cold, turned from the 
mold and surrounded with a fruit sauce. This is a rich, yet delicate 
pudding. 

Taylor Pudding. — Stir into a cup of sweet milk a level teaspoonful 
of soda and a teaspoonful of salt. Beat into the milk a cup of Porto 
Rican molasses and stir tlie wet ingredients slowly into two cups of well- 
sifted flour. Beat the batter well and pour it into a greased cake tin. 
It will be about the consistency of cake batter. Bake it in a hot oven 
for about thirty or forty minutes. When it is nearly done prepare a 
liquid sauce, as follows : Put in a saucepan five tablespoonfuls of sugar 
and 10 tahlespoonfuls of water. Let it boil for four minutes and then 
add three level tablespoonfuls of butter and flavor well with nutmeg. 
When the pudding is done turn it out on a platter and carry • it to the 
table. Serve it cut in thick slices with the liquid sauce. 

Yorkshire Pudding. — This is a batter pudding cooked where it will 
receive the drippings from the roasting meat, and it is very good; as 
originally made it was cooked in front of an open fire, where it would 
receive drippings from the meat cooking upon a spit. About an hour 
before the roast of beef is done drain off the gravy, leaving about two 
tablespoonfuls in the dripping pan. The meat should be laid upon a rack 
over the pan, so as to raise it up. The pudding requires three eggs, one 
pint of milk, six large tablespoonfuls of flour, one-half teaspoonful of 
salt, and two dashes of pepper. Beat the eggs until light, then add the 
milk. Put the flour into, a bowl, moisten it gradually with the eggs and 
milk, beat until smooth ; strain it through a sieve to avoid lumps, add the 
pepper and salt, pour it into the dripping pan and bake. Cut into squares 
or strips, and serve around the meat. 



CHAPTER VI. 



APPLES. 



Apple ! Apple ! Call for Apple ! 

Everywhere you go ! 
Closely watch the Wll of fare, 
And If apple is not there, 
Then proceed at once to pare, 
Cook and landlord down with care. 

Since apples play a large part in farmhouse economy, it has been 
thought well to group recipes for their use together, rather than sepa- 
rating them in various chapters. A few other apple recipes will he 
found, however, included among jellies and preserves, cakes and pastry. 

Baked Apples. — ^Pare and core cooking apples; put in a granite pan; 
put over them a cupful of sugar, butter the size of a walnut; cover; bake 
until almost done; take the cover off and let them brown. When apples 
are baked in a covered earthen dish or casserole flavor and appearance 
are at their best. Pare and core the apples, sprinkle them with sugar 
and a little powdered cloves and cinnamon. Add a little water, cover the 
dish, and bake a long time in a slow oven. The apples cook to a deep 
red, and are very tender and rich in flavor. Honey is a desirable addi- 
tion to baked -apples. Wipe or peel the apples, and remove the core 
without running the knife clear through. Into this hollow put a bit of 
butter and a teaspoon ful of honey, and bake after the ordinary manner. 

Baked Apples in Jelly. — Peel, core and quarter a quart of apples, add 
half a cupful of water and three-fourths cupful of sugar, put in a cov- 
ered earthen dish and cook three to four hours in a slow oven, when 
they should be dark red in color. Then mix with the apples a cupful 
of liquid lemon jelly, and set in a mold to harden. These baked apples 
are also very nice eaten warm without the jelly. 

Fancy Baked Apples. — ^Peel and core medium-sized tart apples. Put 
them in a baking dish and pour half a cup of water over them. Set in 
a hot oven, and when the apples are heated, sprinkle with enough sugar 
to coat each and bake until tender. Make a syrup of one cup of water, 
half a cup of sugar, the juice of half a lemon, and a teaspoonful of the 
grated rind. Add two tablespoonfuls of chopped raisins, two of chopped 
candied cherries, two of chopped candied pineapple, and two of chopped 
almonds, and when the sugar is dissolved set at the back of the stove and 
let cook slowly for half an hour. When the apples are done put in little 
glass saucers, taking care not to break them. Fill with the cooked 
sweets and pour the syrup over them. Serve cold with whipped cream. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 71 

Boiled Apples in Syrup.— Rub the apples clean, but do not peel, and 
stick four cloves into each. Put in. earthen dish, half cover with cold 
water, and add one cup of sugar to each pint of water. Place upon 
stove and cook until apple skins crack; remove apples, then boil down 
syrup until it is like jelly, and pour over the fruit. 

Apple Butter. — Apple butter should be made from new cider, fresh 
from the press, and not yet fermented. Fill a porcelain-lined kettle with 
cider and boil until reduced one-half. Then boil another kettleful in 
the same way, and so continue until you have sufficient quantity. To 
every four gallons of boiled cider allow a half-bushel of nice juicy 
apples, pared, cored and quartered. The cider should be boiled the day 
before you make the apple butter. Fill a very large kettle with the 
boiled cider and add as many apples as can be kept moist. Stir fre- 
quently, and when the apples are soft beat with a wooden stick until they 
are reduced to a pulp. Cook and stir continuously until the consistency 
is that of soft marmalade and the color is a very dark brown. Have 
boiled cider at hand in case it becomes too thick, and apples if too thin. 
Twenty minutes before you take it from the fire add ground cinnamon, 
and nutmeg to taste. It requires no sugar. When cold, put into stone 
jars and cover closely. 

Apple Dumplings. — Pare, quarter and core tart apples. Put one table- 
spoonful of baking powder in one quart of flour, add one cupful of lard 
and half a teaspoonful of salt and mix with sweet milk, make stiffer than 
for biscuits, roll and cut in squares and put around the pieces of apple. 
Into a deep pudding dish put one quart of water, one cupful of sugar 
and a small lump of butter. Set it on top of the stove and let it come 
to a boil. Then put in the dumplings and bake in a brisk oven one hour. 

Apple Dumplings with Bread Dough. — Take out about a pint of bread 
dough in the morning when iL is ready to go in the baking pans, more 
or less according to the size of the family; add shortening half the size 
of an egg, mix through the dough and set aside until an hour and a 
half before dinner. Then cut the dough into as many pieces as there are 
persons to serve and roll out. Pare and core good, tart apples, set one 
on each sheet of dough, putting a teaspoonful of sugar and a small lump 
of butter in the place of the core, fold the dough about the apple, pinch- 
ing it tightly together, set them in a deep earthen dish and let rise half 
an hour; then sprinkle a tablespoonful of sugar over them and pour on 
one cupful of cold water and bake half an hour in a hot oven. It may 
be well to cover them with a greased paper to keep them from getting 
too brown or crusty. Eat warm with cream and sugar or any sauce 
preferred. Also excellent steamed. 

Boiled Apple Dumplings.— Pare eight fine apples and cut them in 
quarters, remove the cores. Roll the suet crust out half an inch thick and 



73 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

cut into round pieces. Dust each piece of apple with a little sugar and 
cinnamon and place four sections on each round of paste. Gather up 
the edges and pinch them together over the apple. When all the dump- 
lings are made, drop them into a kettle of boiling water and let them 
boil gently for an hour. Take them up on a hot dish and serve with 
plain, sweetened cream. If you want to serve the dumplings "just as 
grandmother did," sweeten the cream with "treacle." 

Kenilworth Ranch Dumplings.— Take a quart of flour, one cup of 
good lard and half-cup of butter ; rub this into the flour after it is sifted 
with one teaspoonful of baking powder; add enough milk to make a 
soft dough. This is rolled out quickly into a sheet an inch thick and 
then cut in squares. Into each square is laid a half apple, peeled and 
cored, and the crust tucked around it. Have ready in a dripping pan 
a syrup made of one cupful of sugar to one of water; lay the dumplings 
in; bake in quick oven 30 to 40 minutes. Serve with an old-fashioned 
molasses sauce. 

Farmhouse Apples. — Peel and core tart apples, fill the space from 
which the cores were taken with seeded raisins, bits of shredded citron, 
sugar and a little lemon peel; stand them in a baking pan, pour over 
them half a cup of water and dust with about two tablespoonfuls of 
granulated sugar. Bake in a slow oven until perfectly tender, then 
sprinkle bread crumbs over the top; dust again with sugar, and leave 
them in the oven for 10 minutes. While they are baking mix a table- 
spoonful of flour with a half cup sugar; pour over half a pint of boiling 
water, and boil a moment; take from the fire, and pour slowly over one 
well-beaten egg; add the juice of half a lemon. Pour over the apples 
and serve warm. 

Apple Fool. — Peel, core and quarter six large apples, cook them until 
tender with three or four cloves, a small piece of lemon peel, half a 
cupful of sugar and a teacupful of water. Remove the cloves and lemon 
peel, beat well with a fork and stir in one-fourth pint of thick, sweet 
cream. Cut any kind of delicate cake into rather thin slices and place a 
layer in the bottom of a glass dish. Pour over it diluted red currant 
jelly, then cover with a thick layer of the apple fool, then another layer 
of cake and currant jelly, and heap the remainder of the apple fool over 
the top. With each helping serve a large spoonful of whipped cream 
flavored with almond. 

Hidden Apples. — Butter a deep tin pan, cover the bottom with a layer 
of pared and quartered apples. In another dish, beat an egg well, put in 
enough sugar to sweeten the apples, add a little water, thicken with 
powdered bread crumbs, flavor highly with lemon. Pour this mixture 
over apples and bake until the apples are done, which will take about 
20 minutes in a hot oven. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 73 

Apple Johnny Cake.— Mix two cupfuls of cornmeal, a saltspoonful of 
salt, a teaspoonful of cream of .tartar, a scant half-cupful of sugar, half 
a teaspoonful of soda dissolved in a little warm water and milk to make 
a thin batter. Stir in three sour apples that have been peeled and cut 
into thin slices. Bake in a shallow tin in a moderate oven for 35 minutes. 
Apple Kisses. — Select six small, smooth appleS. Pare, cut in half and 
remove the core. Mix one-half a cupful of sugar with one-third cupful 
of butter. Place this mixture between the halves of the apples. Place 
in a baking dish with a little water and a teaspoonful of vanilla extract 
Bake till apples are soft. Serve with their own juice for sauce. 

Apple Pancakes. — Measure two cupfuls of sifted flour; add half a 
teaspoonful of salt and sift again. Then stir in gradually two cupfuls of 
cold water and the beaten yolks of three or four eggs, making a per- 
fectly smooth batter. When well mixed, fold in the whites of the eggs 
beaten to a froth. Place a tablespoonful of fat in an iron frying pan 
and when hot pour in enough batter ;to cover the bottom of the pan 
quarter of an inch thick; have a few nicely-flavored apples, pared, cored 
and finely minced; sprinkle a layer of the apple over the cake (not too 
much, or the pancake is liable to break). As the cake cooks, slip a 
flexible knife under it, lifting it so it will not burn, and shake the pan 
gently to and fro. When the pancake is a light brown on under side, 
slip it on to a hot plate, put a piece of butter on top of the apples, hold 
the frying pan over it and deftly turn the cake back into the pan and 
cover and cook until the apples are soft. Then slip it out of pan on to a 
hot plate; set the plate over hot water to keep the cake warm and con- 
tinue frying up remainder of the batter in same manner. Serve them 
separately or piled, one upon the other. Serve with s.ugar sprinkled over 
them and oranges or lemons cut in halves for squeezing over them. This 
quantity of batter should make four cakes. Do not have your pan too 
large. 

Apple Custard Pancakes. — Beat four eggs light, adding to them a half 
pint of cream and a little ground cinnamon. Peel and core the apples, 
cut them in thin slices and fry them tender in a little butter. When 
browned slightly, turn them over, pour in the custard and fry to a light 
brown. Turn out on a hot flat dish and sprinkle powdered sugar over 
the pancake. 

Apple Pie. — As a variation from the ordinary pie with two crusts, 
slice apples into a deep earthen pie dish, sweeten and flavor to taste, and 
cover with a top crust only. The absence of a soggy bottom crust is 
usually viewed as an advantage. 

Apple Custard Pie. — Peel and cut apples very fine. Line a deep pan 
-with' crust, put in the apples; scatter over them small pieces of butter 
and a covering of granulated sugar. Then pour over all a cupful of 



74 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

sweet cream and bake until the apples are cooked. Serve just before it 
is quite cold. 

Dutch Apple Pie.— Make a rich puff paste and line deep pie plate. 
Core and cut into eighths as many rich tart apples as will fill the pie 
plate by laying each piece of apple with the curved side up, just as close 
together as can be placed; over the top sprinkle half cup light brown 
sugar, half teaspoonful cinnamon and tablespoonful flour. Dot bits of 
butter over the top and add half cup water; bake slowly and carefully 
until apples are tender and water absorbed. Serve warm with cheese. 

Dried Apple Pie. — Cook a large handful of dried apples quickly in a 
tightly-covered granite basin in a little less than a quart of water. Six 
halves of dried apricots are cut fine and cooked in very little water. Fill 
in the apple, then the apricot, together with water they were cooked in; 
add a small cupful of sugar, and nutmeg, making the pie with two crusts, 
and bake quickly. 

Apple Pot-pie. — Serve this with maple-sugar sauce. Half fill a deep 
dish with sour apples which have been quartered, pared and cored. Pour 
over them a little boiling water and place in a hot oven until tender. 
Make a crust as for baking powder biscuit, roll out an inch thick; lay 
it over the apples and return to the oven for about 40 minutes or until 
the crust is done. For the sauce cook together two tablespoonfuls of 
butter and one teaspoonful of flour, add half a cupful of maple syrup 
and a tiny pinch of mace, and cook until clear and smooth. 

Apple Pudding. — Make a dough as for baking powder biscuit; roll out 
one-quarter inch thick. Peel and slice good tart apples rather thin; put 
them in the middle of the dough, put on them half a cupful of sugar, 
tablespoonful of butter, and nutmeg. Wet the edges, lap over the apples 
well to keep the juice in, put over the apples a little water, put pudding 
in a cheesecloth bag, and boil two hours steady. Eat with good cream. 

Baked Apple Pudding. — Butter a granite or enameled pie tin and fill 
it with pared and quartered Duchess apples, cut in rather thick slices. 
Cover with a thick batter made from a cup of flour, in which a teaspoon- 
ful of baking powder, a saltspoon of salt and a tablespoon of butter 
have been well mixed. Add two-thirds of a cup of sweet milk, or sour 
milk in which a quarter of a teaspoon of soda has been dissolved; we 
prefer the sour milk. Only about half as much baking powder is 
required with the sour milk as when sweet milk is used, but we always 
use some and find that it makes the food lighter and better than where 
soda alone is used. When the pudding is done reverse it on a plate, 
spread with butter and sprinkle over it a half cup of sugar, add a few 
gratings of nutmeg. Eat with cream. 

Canadian Pudding.— One quart of quartered sour apples, one-half cup- 
ful of sugar, one-fourth cupful of water, a pinch of grated nutmeg. Bake 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 75 

these ingredients together 20 minutes in a deep pudding dish ; then remove 
and pour over the apples the following batter : One cupful of flour, one 
tablespoonful sugar, one-fourth teaspoonful salt, one beaten egg, two 
tablespoonfuls of soft butter. Return to the oven, increase the heat and 
bake for 20 minutes more. Serve with maple sauce made as follows: 
Add to one thoroughly-beaten egg one cupful of grated maple sugar, one 
cupful of whipped cream, one-half teaspoonful of vanilla. In Vermont. 
where this recipe was obtained, a bowl of grated maple sugar invariably 
accompanied most desserts. Pudding sauces were always well covered 
with it. 

Caramel Pudding. — Peel, core and slice enough sour apples to measure 
one pint. Cook them slowly in a saucepan in two tablespoonfuls of 
butter until soft; then add one cupful of sugar, one-quarter of a tea- 
spoonful of cinnamon, two tablespoonfuls of caramel and simmer for 
twenty minutes. ]\Iix together one and one-half cupfuls of stale bread 
crumbs, one-half cupful cf crumbled stale macaroons and one-half cupful 
of seedless raisins. Butter a deep dish and fill with alternate layers of 
the apples and bread mixture, having crumbs on top. Bake three-quarters 
of an hour in a rather hot oven, and serve cold with whipped cream. 

Eureka Pudding. — Put one or two quarts of boiling water in stewpan, 
add cornmeal to make a thick gruel, and teaspoonful of salt. Let it boil 
long and slowly. While cooking peel and slice five or six (more or less) 
good cooking apples ; add to gruel. Let boil tender, add sugar and boil 
longer as for apple sauce. Turn into a mold and eat hot or cold with 
cream or boiled milk. This can be improved by putting the whites of 
eggs beaten stiff into pudding before taken from the fire; add the yolks 
to the boiled milk and serve with the pudding. 

German Pudding.^Pare, core and slice eight or 10 sour apples and 
put in a deep pudding dish, sweetening with one cupful of sugar, and 
sprinkling with a little lemon juice. Pour over them a rich egg batter, 
bake in a moderate oven one hour, and serve cold. 

Indian Apple Pudding. — Take one-half of a cup of molasses, one quart 
of milk, one teaspoonful of salt, three scant cups of pared and sliced 
apples, to which add a quarter of a teaspoonful of ginger and cinnamon. 
When the milk boils in the double boiler, pour it slowly on the meal. 
Cook half an hour in the boiler, stirring often. Now add the other 
ingredients; pour into a deep, well-greased pudding dish and bake slowly. 
Eat with cream or maple syrup. 

Queen Apple Pudding. — Make a rich pie crust, and roll out in an 
oblong sheet. Spread with chopped apples, cinnamon, sugar and butter 
(cream the sugar and butter together for convenience in spreading), roll 
up like a jelly cake, and cut off in two-inch lengths. Stand the slices in 
a dripping pan, with a little water around them, and bake thoroughly for 



76 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

30 minutes. Very good either hot or cold. If desired it may be baked 
in the entire roll, instead of slices. 

Apple Roly-Poly. — Mix a half cupful of finely-chopped suet, one egg, 
one teaspoonful of baking powder, three-quarters of a cupful of cold 
water and a quarter of a teaspoonful of salt, with flour enough to make 
a stiff paste. Roll out the paste in a sheet about three-quarters of an 
uich thick, brush it over with the yolk of the egg and sprinkle with 
one tablespoonful of fine bread crumbs. Spread over it three apples 
peeled and sliced thin. Sprinkle with one-half tablespoonful of sugar 
and roll the paste. Brush the toll with egg, sprinkle it with bread crumbs 
and roll it in a napkin that has been wrung out of hot water and tliaf 
has been covered on one side with flour. Lap the ends over securely, tie 
with a string and boil in water that has been slightly salted for an hour 
and a half. Serve with lemon sauce. 

Sour Apple Pudding.' — Peel and slice several sour cooking apples into 
n pudding dish ; add sugar and water as for stewing. Cover and bake 
until nearly tender. Sift together two cupfuls of flour, three tablespoon- 
fuls of baking powder, and a scant half teaspoonful of salt. Beat one 
egg, mix in half a cup of sugar, two tablespoonfuls of melted butter and 
one cupful of milk, then stir the latter into the dry ingredients. Pour the 
batter over the partly cooked apples, and bake about 20 minutes. Serve 
with whipped cream or a creamy sauce made with sugar, white of egg, 
and lump of butter. 

Apple Souffle. — Stew the apples as if for sauce, adding a little lemon 
peel and juice. Spread the stewed apples high around a baking dish. 
Make a custard of the yolks of two eggs, a pint of milk, a pinch of 
cinnamon and a tablespoonful of sugar. Let the custard cool and then 
pour it into the dish with the apples. Beat the whites of the eggs and 
spread over the top, sprinkling with sugar, and set it in the oven to brown. 
The apples should be about an inch thick at the bottom and sides of 
the dish. 

Spiced Apples with Cider.— Boil together one cupful of cider, one- 
quarter cupful vinegar, one cupful brown sugar, one bay leaf, two tea- 
spoonfuls whole allspice, two dozen whole cloves, two inches stick cinna- 
mon, two blades mace. Pare and core eight large, tart apples, cut in 
quarters and add to the boiling syrup; simmer gently until tender, but 
not broken. Take out the fruit carefully, boil syrup until thick as honey, 
pour over apples and serve cold. These are delicious with roast goose, 
duck or pork or any cold meat. 

Navy Apple Shortcake.— Butter thickly an oblong granite baking dish. 
Halve and core as many good cooking apples as will fit tightly in dish; 
cover thickly with sugar (about a coffee cupful), several grates of nut- 
meg and three tablespoonfuls of boiling vyater; make g rich shortcake 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 77 

dough and roll and cover the apples; bake in a quick oven half an 
hour; loosen round the edges of the crust, turn it upside down on a hot 
platter, with a heated knife cut into squares and serve at once. 

Apple Sponge.— Beat the yolks of three eggs with half a cupful of 
powdered sugar; flavor with lemon; beat for about 10 minutes; add to 
it the beaten whites of the eggs. Peel three big tender apples; cut them 
in thin little slices; sift half a cupful of flour with half a teaspoonful 
baking powder and mix well with the former ; put it in a buttered baking 
pan and bake in moderate oven for half an hour; spread powdered sugar 
over and serve. 

Apple Puffs. — Chop four sour apples very fine, stir into them one 
beaten egg, one-fourth cupful molasses, a cupful and a half of cornmeal, 
the same amount of sifted flour and half a teaspoonful of salt; dissolve 
half a teaspoonful of soda in warm water and add it, using enough water 
to make a thin batter. Bake in buttered cups in a quick oven. 

Royal George. — Dissolve half a teaspoonful of soda in a little warm 
water; add to a cupful of sour cream with a pinch of salt. Then add 
flour enough to make a dough stiff enough to roll out. Roll this paste 
very thin and line a deep pudding dish with it, reserving a little for the. 
top. Fill the dish with tart apples, pared and quartered. Sprinkle half a 
cupful of sugar over them and dust with cinnamon. Cover with the rest 
of the paste, cut out in rings and diamonds, and bake until the apples 
are done. Eat hot with cream or sugar and butter beaten to a white 
cream. 

Scalloped Apples. — Pare and quarter tart apples. Put in the baking 
dish a layer of cracker crumbs, cover liberally with butter and granu- 
lated sugar. Then lay the apples with edges lapping and sprinkle' chopped 
almonds over them. Then put more crumbs, butter and sugar, then 
another layer of apples, and sprinkle lightly with crumbs, butter, sugar 
and cinnamon. Bake until apples are done. Serve with rich cream. 

Red Apple Sauce. — Wash and quarter — do not pare — enough red 
apples to fill the bean pot; sprinkle over a cupful of sugar — more or less, 
according to the size of the pot — cover and place in the oven on ironing 
day. Cook three or four hours and pour into a pretty glass dish to cool. 
The result will be a delicious surprise in the matter of rich flavor and 
dainty appearance. 

Baked Apple Sauce. — Wash and rub dry a sufficient number of Baldwin 
apples. Remove peel in long strips. Butter a beanpot and fill with the 
cored and sliced apples, packed in layers. Sprinkle each layer generously 
with sugar, and sparingly with tiny bits of butter, then cover with strips 
of peel. Repeat until the beanpot is full. Bake in a slow oven for two 
hours. Pour out, and with a fork remove the strips of peel. Serve 
heaped in sherbet glasses and topped with a spoonful of whipped cream. 



78. THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Instead of the usual watery mass, you will have a rich red sauce, deli- 
cately flavored with the peel, and of about the consistency of marmalade. 

Steamed Apple Sauce.— Pare and slice the apples rather thinner than 
for sauce cooked in the usual way, dropping into cold water as you slice 
them. Drain, turn into the inner vessel of a double boiler, and fit on the 
cover. Fill the outer kettle with warm water and bring to a steady boil. 
Keep this up for half an hour after the boil begins, then lift the lid and 
beat the soft apple to a mush with a spoon. Close and cook 15 minutes 
longer. Run through a colander or a vegetable press, sweeten to taste 
while hot, and set away to cool. 

Apple Slump. — Make a thin apple sauce, sweeten and flavor with nut- 
meg; have about two quarts when done. Take pint flour, mix as for 
biscuit dough, drop the dough by small spoonfuls into the boiling sauce, 
after they have risen and got set turn over. When done take dumpling.s 
out in a deep dish and pour sauce over them; serve hot. 

Apple Butter Without Cider. — Procure a new 50-pound lard can, eight 
pounds light brown sugar. Peel and slice the apples. Then commence 
to fill the can, first a layer of apples, then a layer of sugar, and so on 
until the can is full. Cover tightly and let it stand 12 hours. Place on 
f-tove and when it begins to boil set it back on the stove until it simmers, 
or boils gently. Do not take off lid for five hours. Then remove and 
put in ground cloves and cinnamon to suit your taste. 

Suet Apple Dumplings. — One cup of chopped suet, two cups of flour, 
one teaspoonful of salt, mix with cold water into a dough; put the apples 
in as for pudding; tie in little cloths; drop into boiling water; boil one 
hour. Use any sauce, or sugar only. 



CHAPTER VII. 

BRBAD AND MUFFINS. 

Here is the recipe for making good bread, given by the great milling 
companies and used by food demonstrators : To one quart of lukewarm 
liquid — half water and half milk, or water alone — add two half-ounce 
compressed yeast cakes, or the usual quantity of liquid yeast, and stir 
until dissolved. Add one teaspoonful of salt and three tablespoonfuls 
of sugar, and when well dissolved stir in with wooden spoon three quarts 
of well-sifted flour, or until dough is sufficiently . stiff to be turned from 
the mixing bowl to the molding board in a mass. If shortening is desired 
add two tablespoonfuls lard. Knead this dough, adding if necessary 
from time to time, flour until it becomes smooth and elastic and ceases 
to stick to fingers or board. Do not make dough too stiff. Spring wheat 
flour needs a little more working than Winter wheat, and should be a 
little softer to make it rise properly. Put dough into well-greased 
earthen bowl, brush lightly with melted butter or drippings, cover with 
towel and set in warm place, about 75 degrees, for two hours, or until 
light, then knead well and return to bowl, cover as before and set for 
another hour's rising, or until light. When light, form gently into loaves 
or rolls, place in greased bread pans, brush with butter or drippings, 
cover again and let stand for one and one-half hour, then bake. When 
bread becomes stale it may be made palatable again and as good as 
new, or even better than new, by wetting the old loaf with cold water, 
putting in tlie pan and rebaking it in the oven 20 to 45 minutes. It will, 
if originally good, come out moist and fresh. 

Boston Brown Bread. — Two cupfuls Indian meal; one cupful whole 
wheat flour; one cupful sour milk; one-third cupful molasses; one tea- 
spoonful soda; one-half teaspoonful salt. Mix and steam three hours, 
then brown in hot oven with the lid removed from the can. There are 
tin molds made smaller at the bottom than the top, so the loaf slips out 
nicely— the lid fitting on the outside of the tin to prevent the water 
getting in the bread, but any small tin pail with tight lid will answer 
the purpose. It is better to place an iron lid or ring in the bottom of 
the kettle to prevent the mold from coming too close to the fire. Slice 
around the loaf, not perpendicularly. 

Easy Brown Bread.— For one loaf take one cup of sour milk, one cup 
of sweet milk, one teaspoon of salt, one-half cup of molasses with one 
teaspoon of soda thoroughly stirred in; add one-half cup of white flour 
and about three cups of graham flour. Mix so stiff that a little dough 



80 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

dropped from the spoon will not quickly settle. Put in a deep bread 
pan and bake in a moderately hot oven for one hour. If not stiff enough, 
the top crust may separate from the rest of the loaf. 

Entire Wheat Bread. — iOne pint milk, scalded and cooled, one table- 
spoonful sugar, one teaspoonful salt, one-half cupful yeast, about five 
or six cupfuls whole wheat flour. In the morning mix in the order 
given, and knead until smooth and elastic. Let rise till light, allow it 
to rise a little longer, and then bake a little longer, and in an oven not 
quite so hot, as for white bread. Whole-wheat bread rises more than 
white bread, because the flour contains more gluten. Sometimes we 
make a sponge with white flour, in the same proportion as for ordinary 
bread, and then thicken and knead with the entire wheat flour. 

Light Bread.— Into two quarts of wheat flour stir a teaspoonful of 
granulated sugar and a half teaspoonful of salt, and sift into a large 
bowl. Bring to the scalding-point two cups of milk; stir into this a 
generous teaspoonful of butter, and, when this melts, add two cups of 
boiling water. Remove from the fire and set aside until blood-warm, 
then stir in a gill of water of the same temperature, in which a half- 
cake of compressed yeast has been thoroughly dissolved. Make a hollow 
in the centre of the sifted flour and pour in the liquid. Stir to a soft 
dough, then turn upon a floured board and knead for 15 minutes; set in 
a bread raiser in a warm place for six hours or until light. Make into 
three loaves of uniform size, knead each of these for at least five min- 
utes, put into a baking-pan, cover with a cloth, and set to rise until very 
light. Bake in a steady oven. 

Oatmeal Brown Bread. — Mix in a large bowl one pint of Quaker 
oats, a rounding teaspoonful of salt, a pint of Petti John's breakfast 
food, half a pint of whole wheat flour and half a pint of yellow gran- 
ulated cornmeal. Put into another bowl one pint of thick sour milk and 
half a pint of molasses. Dissolve a level teaspoonful of bicarbonate 
of soda in two tablespoonfuls of warm water; add this to the molasses 
and sour milk; stir until foaming; then add it to the dry ingredients 
and mix until every grain is moistened. Turn into a greased mold and 
boil or steam continuously for four hours. Stand in a moderate oven 
for 30 minutes. It will then be ready to use. This may be toasted on 
the second day, or warmed over in the oven, or it may be used cold. 
Toasted it makes an acceptable breakfast bread. 

Scotch Oat Bread. — To two cups of steel-cut oatmeal, one teaspoon- 
ful soda and one teaspoonful salt, add two cups of boiling water; when 
cool add one cup of molasses and one cake of yeast. Stand over night. 
In the morning mix stiff with wheat flour. Shape into loaves, let rise 
and bake. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 81 

Salt-Rising Bread. — Dissolve a half teaspoonful of salt in two cups 
of scalding water, and beat in gradually enough flour to make a very 
soft dough. Beat for 10 minutes, cover and set in a very warm place 
for eight hours. Now stir a teaspoonful of salt into a pint of lukewarm 
■ milk and add enough flour to make a stiff batter before working it into 
the risen dough. Mix thoroughly, cover and set again in a warm place 
to rise until very light. Turn into a wooden bowl and knead in enough 
flour to make the batter of the consistency of ordinary bread dough. 
Make into loaves and set these to rise, and when light, bake. 

Sour Milk Corn Bread. — Mix together in a bowl three cupfuls of 
corn meal and one cupful of graham flour. Stir in a teaspoonful of 
salt, a tablcspoonful of melted butter, and two cupfuls of sour milk. 
Now beat in three eggs, whipped light, and a small teaspoonful of 'Soda 
dissolved in a little boiling water. Beat for five minutes, then pour into 
a greased mold with a funnel in the center. Bake for an hour, or until 
a straw comes out clear from the thickest part of the loaf. 

Spoon Corn Bread. — Put a quart of milk, or half milk and half water, 
in a double boiler. Add four large kitchen spoonfuls of white cornmeal, 
and stir and cook five minutes. Remove from the fire and let it cool, 
stirring it once or twice as it cools. Then add two or three eggs beaten 
with two tablespoonfuls of wheat flour, one tablespoonful of butter and 
a scant teaspoonful of salt. Mix well, then pour into a greased baking 
dish, and bake 35 minutes.- Serve immediately in dish in which it is 
baked, with a folded napkin wrapped around the dish. 

Susan's Cornbread. — One cup white flour, one-half cup yellow corn- 
meal, one-half teaspoonful salt, one tablespoonful sugar, two teaspoon- 
fuls baking powder. Sift dry ingredients, then mix with one beaten 
egg and enough sweet milk to make a thin batter, stirring in at the 
last a piece of butter the size of a walnut melted. Pour into a well- 
greased shallow pan and bake in a quick oven. 

Crackling Bread. — One quart of cornmeal — three pints make more 
dough — a pint of buttermilk, a teaspoonful of soda, a big pinch of salt, 
a pint of brown cracklings left from making lard, warm water. Crush 
the cracklings with a rolling pin, heat them and stir in the dough, 
which must be thick enough to mold well (thin with the warm water). 
Mold the bread with the hands in small oblong pones about three inches 
thick, putting the pones as you mold them in hot, well-greased pans. 
Bake in a hot oven until brown. 

Crumb-loaf.— Beat two eggs with a pinch of salt added; add a cupful 
of sweet milk and a quarter of a cupful of sugar. Stir in enough 
bread crumbs to make a medium thick batter, then add flour enough to 
thicken like corn bread. Sift a teaspoonful of baking powder in with 



83 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

the flour. Bake to a rich, crisp br0wn and serve hot. Fine for either 
breakfast or supper. 

Egg Bread. — Two eggs, one pint of buttermilk, three pints of corn- 
meal, one-half pint of lard, one teaspoonful of soda, a pinch of salt, sweet 
milk or sweet cream. Stir the soda in the buttermilk until it boils up, 
mix the bread quickly, adding a sufficient quantity of sweet milk or 
sweet cream to make a rather thin batter; beat in the eggs, and add 
the lard, melted and hot, last. Pour quickly into frying hot greased 
baking pans and bake quickly to a delicate brown. This bread will be a 
golden yellow and as light as cake. 

Swedish Breakfast Bread. — Add one-third cup butter, one-fourth cup 
sugar, and one-half teaspoon salt to one cup scalded milk. When luke- 
warm, add one-third yeast-cake dissolved in one-fourth cup lukewarm 
milk, one egg, well beaten, one-half cup raisins, stoned and cut in pieces, 
and flour to make a stiff batter. Cover and let rise over night; in morn- 
ing cut down and spread in buttered dripping-pan, one-half inch thick. 
Cover and let rise again. Before baking brush over with beaten egg and 
cover with the following mixture : Melt three tablespoons butter, add 
one-third cup sugar, and one teaspoon cinnamon. When sugar is par- 
tially melted, add three tablespoons flour. Bake in a moderate oven, and 
cut in squares for serving. 

Beaten Biscuits. — One quart of sifted flour, one tablespoonful of 
lard, one-half pint cold water. Put the flour and salt in a bowl, rub the 
lard in with the hands, add the water gradually. Work and knead until 
smooth and elastic. Then put the dough on a block and pound it with 
a mallet, rolling pin or ax for one hour until full of bubbles. The. old- 
fashioned rule was to "hit it 500 licks." Form into small round cakes, 
stick with a fork here and there, and bake in a moderately quick oven 
about 20 minutes. They should be brown on top, white on the sides, 
and extremely white inside. 

Bread-crumb Biscuits. — Take one quart each, of bread crumbs and 
sour milk, add one-half cupful of lard, one-half teaspoonful of salt, and 
stiffen with flour in which is put before sifting one teaspoonful each of 
saleratus and baking powder. Mold, and bake in a quick oven. Be 
sure to allow the crumbs to soak for an hour in the milk before adding 
the other ingredients. 

Buttermilk Biscuits. — Two coffeecupfuls (even) of flour, half a cof- 
feecupful of sour milk, half a coffeecupful of buttermilk, one teaspoonful 
of sugar, one teaspoonful of yeast powder, half a teaspoonful of salt, 
half a teaspoonful of soda. Mix sugar, yeast powder and salt with 
flour and sift; dissolve soda in two tablespoonfuls of cold water, beat 
into the sour milk until it stops "purring," mix quickly with dry ingre- 
dients, using a spoon, turn on a well-floured board, pat with the hatid 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 83 

into a cake half an inch thjck, roll, cut into biscuits; bake in a very 
hot oven 10 minutes. 

French Biscuits. — ^One cupful of butter, one cupful of sugar, the stif- 
fly-beaten white of one egg, one-fourth cupful of thick sour milk, half 
a teaspoonful of soda dissolved in a very little hot water, flour enough 
to make a dough that may be rolled out. Sprinkle with sugar, cut into 
large circles, and bake for 20 minutes. 

Martha Washington Biscuits. — Sift one pint of flour with one table- 
spoonful of sugar, one teaspoonful each of baking powder and salt. Rub 
into it one tablespoonful of lard. Mix with one well-beaten egg and one 
cupful of water; roll one-fourth of an inch in thickness and cut with 
small round cutter. Fry in hot fat until cooked on one side, turn and 
brown. 

Molded Biscuits. — One quart of flour, into which two heaping tea- 
spoonfuls of baking powder and one of salt have been sifted; rub into 
it a scant half cupful of lard and butter, half and half ; stir to a dough 
with enough milk to make it just too thin to roll out. Grease muffin 
rings and put on a greased baking pan ; drop from a spoon dough enough 
nearly to fill each ring; bake in a quick oven. Delicious tea cake, to be 
eaten hot with butter, is made by adding a tablespoonful of sugar and one 
well-beaten egg' to this recipe and baking in one loaf, or in a large flat 
cake to be split open and buttered, then cut in sections. 

Potato Biscuits.- — Pare and boil six white potatoes. While hot put 
through a near, then add gradually one pint of scalded milk, one-half of 
a cupful of butter, one teaspoortful each of salt and sugar and one-half 
of a cupful of flour. Let stand until lukewarm, then add one yeast cake 
dissolved in a little warm water and sifted flour to make a soft dough. 
Knead lightly, using no more flour than is needed to keep from sticking 
to the board. Cover and let stand again until very light, then form 
into small rolls, handling most carefully and greasing the hands if the 
dough is inclined to stick. Place in greased pans, let stand until fully 
doubled in bulk, then bake about twenty minutes in a quick oven. 

Sour Cream Biscuits. — Use three good tablespoonfuls of thick sour 
cream; put this into a quart measure and fill it two-thirds' full with 
sweet milk; add half a teaspoonful of salt, two teaspoonfuls of cream 
of tartar and a teaspoonful of soda. Stir into this enough flour to make 
a dough that will roll very soft ; cut into small biscuits, brush well with 
melted butter, and bake about 20 minutes in a good oven. 

Tea Biscuits. — For a six o'clock tea, set the batter about one o'clock. 
Add to one quart sifted flour a teaspoonful sugar, a heaping teaspoonful 
salt, and a tablespoonful each lard and butter ; rub in well ; dissolve one- 
half yeast cake (compressed) in a little tepid water; add to a cupful 
sweet milk; then mix well with the flour; cover and set out of a draught

to rise; when light turn out on the molding board, sprinkle with a very 
little flour and roll out to the thickness of half an inch ; cut out with 
two sizes of round cutters, placing the smaller ones on top of the 
larger, with a brushing of melted butter between ; let stand about an 
hour to rise, then bake. The oven does not need to be as hot as for 
baking powder biscuit. 

Sugared Biscuits.— Ordinary biscuit dough is made, rolled out as for 
cutting, and then lightly spread with butter and sugar, creamed together. 
The dough is then rolled up like a jelly roll, and cut into slices like cin- 
namon buns, each biscuit being sprinkled on top with a little more 
butter and sugar. 

Yarmouth Biscuit. — Mix three-quarters of a pound of sifted flour, 
one-half pound of sugar and one-half pound of currants to a paste with 
half a pound of butter and three eggs. Roll out to one-eighth of an 
inch in thickness and bake a light brown in quick oven. 

Brioche. — This is one of the delicate breads that delight visitors in 
France. One-half pound flour, one egg, one teaspoon sugar, two ounces 
butter, one- half teaspoon salt, one-quarter pint milk, one ounce yeast. 
Sift the flour. Heat milk lukewarm and dissolve in it the butter and 
yeast. Add the egg, well beaten, and the salt and sugar. Then stir 
in the flour, gradually working it all the time with your hand. Beat 
mixture well for 10 minutes, till the dough almost stops sticking to 
your fingers. Cover with a cloth and set in a warm place to rise. When 
four times its original size turn it on a floured board and take pieces 
about the size of a turkey's egg and form into fancy shapes, twists, 
knots, etc. Put in a buttered tin and let rise 15 minutes. When risen, 
brush over lightly with the egg beaten up. Bake in quick oven 20 min- 
utes. 

Buckwheat Cake. — This is an old Canadian recipe and very good. 
Make batter as for buckwheat pancakes, only a trifle thicker, and bake 
in well-greased shallow pan, like com bretid. There should-be a delicious 
brown crust on the bottom. The prepared flour can be used. 

Breakfast Buns. — Scald one-half pint of milk; pour it over two table- 
spoonfuls of sugar; one quart of lukewarm water; when milk is luke- 
warm add the yeast and enough flour to make a "sponge." Let rise until 
it doubles its original bulk, about two hours ;• then cream together half 
a cupful of butter and half a cupful of sugar; add two well-beaten 
eggs and one cupful of scalded milk. Mix this into the sponge and 
add sufficient flour to make a soft dough; knead lightly, cover and set 
to rise until very light ; then mold into small buns and lay in greased 
pans, allowing plenty of room to rise; then bake in a quick oven for 15 
cr 30 minutes. They must not be. heavy and doughy. 



THE -RURAL COOK BOOK. 85 

Hot Cross Buns.— Beat a quarter cup of butter to a cream ; add four 
tablespoonfuls of sugar and then add gradually a pint of milk that has 
been scalded and cooled; add a yeast cake, dissolved, and sufficient flour 
to make a batter. Beat thoroughly. Stand in a warm place for about 
. three hours. Then add four eggs well beaten and flour "enough to make 
a soft dough. Knead carefully. Stand aside until very light and form 
into buns. Cut them in the center; brush them with sugar and white of 
egg and bake in a quick oven. 

German Coffee Cake. — Take enough dough after it is mixed for one 
loaf and add one egg. shortening half the size of an egg and one-half 
cupful of sugar. Mix thoroughly through the dough and add flour 
enough to roll out an inch thick; let rise and wet the top of it with 
cold water, sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon, and bake. To be cut 
in slices and eaten with or without butter for breakfast with coflfee and 
put up for the children's school lunches in place of so much rich cake. 
For variety roll the dough quite thin and sprinkle it with currants well 
cleansed and dates or figs cut in small bits; then roll up tightly and 
with a sharp knife cut into slices one-half inch thick, lay in greased 
pans, let rise and bake in moderate heat. 

Fastnachts. — Mix to a light sponge the following ingredients : Three- 
fourths quart of warm milk, one-half pound of sifted flour, four ounces 
of melted butter, one ounce of yeast, one-half cupful of sugar, one egg, 
one-half pound of warmed currants, the grated rind of a lemon, one 
teaspoonful of cinnamon. Set in a warm place to rise, when light add 
enough flour to mold into biscuits, place them on baking tins and let 
rise once more, then rub over the top with a brush dipped in a well- 
beaten egg. Bake in a hot oven. Many prefer to serve them warm 
with butter. 

Bran Gems. — Beat two eggs very light, add half a teaspoonful of salt, 
a tablespoonful of brown stigar and one and one-half cupfuls of milk, 
then stir in a pint of finely ground bran. Fill oiled gem pans half full 
and bake in a hot oven 20 minutes. These gems are advised in some 
forms of indigestion, where ftne flour is objectionable. 

Corn Gems. — Sift together one pint of cornmeal, one pint of flour and 
two teaspoonfuls of baking powder. Add one-third of a pint each of 
milk and water. Mix into a firm batter and fill greased gem pans two- 
thirds full. 

Entire ' Wheat Gems. — Three cupfuls entire wheat flour or wheat 
meal, two cupfuls cold water, half cupful of milk. Heat gem pans very 
hot on the top of the stove, fill them even full of the batter, place on the 
grate of a very hot oven. Let them remain 10 minutes on the grate, 
then bake 30 minutes on the bottom of the oven. They are nearly as 



86 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

good if 2^ cupftils of water tind no milk is used. Do not use any salt, 
or they will not be so light. 

Puff Gems.— Beat very light one egg, then add to it one-quarter cup- 
ful sugar, two tablespoonfuls of melted butter, one cupful' of sour milk. 
Beat all well. Then add one cupful of cornmeal and one cupful of 
white flour into which has been well mixed one heaping teaspoonful of 
baking powder. Lastly dissolve one-quarter teaspoonful of soda in one 
tablespoonful of boiling water, add, beat well and pour in gem pans, and 
bake 20 minutes in a hot oven. 

Golden Johnny Cake.^Heat to scalding point one pint of sweet milk; 
while hot stir into it one teaspoonful butter, one teaspoonful white su- 
gar and three-fourths of a cupful of steamed squash out of which all 
water has been pressed. Sift together two cupfuls cornmeal, one cup- 
ful flour, two heaping teaspoonfuls baking powder and a scant tea- 
spoonful salt. Add to this, gradually, the milk and squash, as soon as it 
is lukewarm. Bake in one greased pan, or in gem pans if preferred. If 
Jt seems stiff a little more milk may be added. Bake in a quick oven. 
Meal varies so that it is hard to give the exact quantity. 

Oatmeal Gems. — Separate two eggs; beat the yolks for a moment; add 
a half pint of milk, then one and one-half cup of bread flour, and beat 
thoroughly; add a tablespoonful of melted butter, a half-teaspoonful of 
salt, one cup of left-over oatmeal porridge and one rounding teaspoonful 
of baking powder. Beat for about two minutes. Fold in carefully the 
well-beaten whites of the eggs. Pour tliis mixture into 12 greased gem 
pans and bake in a moderately quick oven 20 minutes. 

Popovers. — To make them without baking powder beat three eggs 
until very light, then add two cupfuls of sweet milk and one-half tea^ 
spoonful of salt. Stir in four cupfuls of flour, and see that the batter 
is very smooth ; then add one additional cupful of milk and a piece 
of butter the size of an egg, melted. Heat the pop-over irons or cups, 
and when they are very hot nearly fill with the batter. Bak^ in a 
quick oven for half an hour. To make pop-overs with baking powder re- 
quires one egg, well beaten, one large spoonful of melted butter, two 
tablespoonfuls of sugar, one cupful of sweet milk, 1>2 cupful of flour, 
salt, and one-fourth tea.spoonful of baking powder. 

Popovers Without Eggs. — One cup of milk, one cup of water, no salt 
and no baking powder. The gem pans are heated, a piece of butter the 
size of a walnut being ptit to melt in each little pan while the batter is 
beaten up. The oven must be good, with steady heat, and the door 
must not be opened for 25 minutes after the popovers are put in, or 
they will fall. Salt will prevent them from rising, but if made accord- 
ing to directions, they will be very light. Flour enough for drop batter. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 



87 



Breakfast Rolls.— Three cups of sweet milk, one cup of butter or 
lard; dissolve one yeast cake in a cup of warm water, mix with flour 
enough to make dough. Let rise over night, in the morning add one 
egg, kiiead thoroughly, let rise again, and when light make out in rolls 
Place in pans, keep warm, and bake when very light. 

Buttermilk Muffins. — A quart of fresh buttermilk, one teaspoonful of 
soda, a pinch of salt and enough flour to make a stiff batter and two 
or three tablespoonfuls of sour cream. Dissolve the soda in a little 
of the buttermilk, then add to the rest; add salt and cream and the 
flour. Bake in gem pans in a hot oven. 

Bread Sponge Muffins. — Late in the evening set a sponge as for 
water bread, allowing a pint of warm water for a dozen muffins, a 
third of a cake of compressed yeast and a pinch of salt. Mix the bat- 
ter a little thicker than for pancakes and beat thoroughly. In the 
morning have gem pans greased, and in cold weather warm them; pour 
in the batter without stirring, filling half full; let them rise at least an 
hour and bake in a hot oven. 

Cape Cod Muffins. — Sift two cupfuls of flour with two teaspoonfuL 
of baking powder, a half-teaspoonful of salt and one rounded teaspoonful 
of sugar. Beat three eggs without separating; add to them 1% cupful 
of milk and stir the milk and eggs into the flour. Have ready a cupful 
of carefully-cleaned blueberries and stir them lightly into the mixture. 
Bake in hot buttered gem pans in a quick oven for 15 minutes. 

Cream of Wheat Muffins. — Add to two cupfuls of cooked cream of 
wheat, a cupful of milk and work it smooth, then two eggs well beaten 
and a tablespoonful of sugar; to a pint of flour add two small tea- 
spoonfuls of baking powder, and a half teaspoonful of salt, rub into the 
flour a tablespoonful lard or butter; add to these ingredients the wheat 
that has been mixed with the milk and eggs. Butter muffin pans, fifl them 
two-thirds full, and bake in a hot oven 20 minutes. 

Crumb Mufiins. — Scraps of stale bread, toasted in the oven until 
crisp, find many uses. We run them through the food chopper until fine 
enough for use. If these crumbs are sifted, the fine particles will be 
found very nice for muffins and griddle cakes. For muffins, use one 
egg, one tablespoonful of butter, one teaspoonful of sugar and half that 
of baking powder, two cupfuls of the crumbs and one of flour; mix 
with water or sweet milk and bake slowly in gem pans. For griddle 
cakes use two cupfuls of crumbs to one of self-raising buckwheat flour. 

English Muffins. — Dissolve half of a compressed yeast cake in six 
tablespoonfuls of lukewarm water. Have a pint of milk scalding hot 
and stir into it a heaping teaspoonful of lard. Boil until the lard is dis- 
solved, then take from the fire and, when the milk is blood warm, stir it 



88 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

gradually into a pint of flour that has been sifted with two saltspoonfuls 
of salt. When the milk is all worked in, add the dissolved yeast cake, 
and blend thoroughly. Turn the batter into a bread raiser and set to 
rise in a moderately warm room for six or eight hours, or until light. 
When light, turn the mass out upon a floured pastry board and break 
off bits of the dough, having them of uniform size, and each about as 
large as an ordinary tea biscuit. Handle very lightly, and roll each 
muffin in flour. Have a soapstone griddle thoroughly heated and lay 
these muffins upon it. Bake them without touching until they swell to 
twice their original size. When brown on the under side lift carefully 
and turn. When the other side is baked to a delicate brown, the muf- 
fins are done. When ready to use, tear them open, toast and butter 
generously. 

Parker House Rolls. — Scald one pint of milk with a piece of butter 
the size of an egg added. Put the milk into a bread pan with one table- 
spoon of sugar and one teaspoon of salt. When the milk has cooled a 
trifle, sift in sufficient flour to make a stiff batter. Now add one cake 
of yeast and beat well, then add flour to make a soft loaf and knead 
thoroughly. Let it stand over night. In the morning, little kneading is 
required. Roll out this and cut with a biscuit-cutter. Brush over with 
melted butter, lap one-half over the other, put in a pan not too close 
together, and when very light, bake in a quick oven. 

Quick Cinnamon Rolls. — Sift together two cups of flour, two teaspoon- 
fuls of baking powder and a half teaspoonful of salt. Into this rub 
one tablespoonful of butter. Mix with milk to make a soft dough. Roll 
out to half an inch in thickness, spread with warmed butter and sprinkle 
with two tablespoonfuls of brown sugar, one teaspoonful of cinnamon 
and scatter over one-half cup of seeded raisins. Roll up as for jelly 
cake and cut into inch slices; place so as they will touch in a pan and 
bake in a quick oven. '' 

Scotch Scones. — Take two pounds of fine oatmeal, a tablespoonful 
of salt, a tablespoonful of lard and enough water to make a stiff dough. 
Rub the lard into the oatmeal and add the salt and water. In rolling 
the palm of the hand should be used instead of a rolling-pin. Press the 
dough into a round cake about a quarter of an inch thick, cut into seg- 
ments and cook on a griddle over a slow fire until a light brown. Oat- 
meal scones properly prepared will keep for weeks. 

Boston Tea Cakes. — Beat two eggs in a teacup, fill the cup with sweet 
milk, turn into a bowl with one cupful of sugar, 10 even teaspoonfuls of 
melted butter, IJ^ cupful of flour and two teaspoonfuls of baking pow- 
der. This is the most reliable, easily made and accommodating of cakes. 
Delicious baked in layers and spread with jam or cream. May be baked 
in a loaf or small patty pans. Serve warm with tea. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 89 

English Tea Cake.— Sift four cupfuls of dried flour into a bowl and 
chop into it a scant cupful of butter. Dissolve half a yeast cake in four 
tablespoonfuls of warm water and stir it into two cupfuls of milk, or 
enough to make a soft dough. Roll this out into a sheet and cut into 
cakes as large as a tea plate and less than half an inch thick. Set them, 
covered lightly, in a warm place until they have nearly trebled in thick- 
ness. Bake in a floured pan. Keep them covered for 20 minutes, then 
brown. Run a sharp knife around the edge, tear the cake open, butter 
and serve upon a plate lined and covered with a heated napkin. 

Zimmet-Kuchen. — Two cupfuls of bread sponge, one egg, half a cup- 
ful of sugar, butter the size of a walnut, one cupful of warm water. 
Mix these ingredients together and make a dough not quite as stiff as 
for bread. Let it rise well, roll out one-half inch thick, let it rise again 
until quite light. Spread the dough thinly and evenly in a long shallow 
tin. Cover with an egg beaten with a tablespoonful of sugar and 
sprinkle liberally with powdered cinnamon and granulated sugar. The 
ingredients on the kuchen will melt and run together into a delicious can- 
died top. Serve by cutting into strips one inch wide. 

Butter Cakes. — Sift two cupfuls of floor with three teaspoonfuls of 
baking powder and a half teaspoonful of salt. Rub in two tablespoonfuls 
of butter and add gradually three-fourths of a cupful of milk. Toss 
upon a well-floured board and roll out as thick as though you were 
making biscuit, then cut into rounds with a small biscuit cutter and bake 
upon a hot, well-greased griddle. Cook slowly until they puff up double 
their size, then turn and bake on the other side. Set them in a moderate 
oven for a few minutes before serving, then break them open and serve 
with butter and maple syrup. 

Waffles. — For the batter use one pint of sifted flour, one level tea- 
spoonful baking powder, one-half teaspoonful salt, one tablespoonful but- 
ter, melted, two eggs and IJ^ cupful milk; beat to a smooth batter. Heat 
the waffle iron very hot; grease both lids; put a cooking spoonful of 
batter into each lid, and cook five minutes on each side. Slip out on to a 
hot dish. Place in the oven until more are cooked, then -put them one 
on top of the other, each buttered and heaped with grated maple sugar. 



CHAPTER VIII. 

CAKES. 

"Breathes there a man with soul so dead 
He loves not new-baked ginger bread? 
Who, stepping through the kitchen door, 
On baking day sees goodly store 
Of fragrant amber-shadowed cake. 
And, half-unconscious, does not break 
A ragged chunk ! Ah, toothsome bliss ! 
He is a churl who knows not this." 

To get a iine grained cake, beat thoroughly after the flour is added. 
Sweet milk makes cake that cuts like pound cake. Sour milk makes 
spongy, light cake. Always sift flour before measuring, then it may be 
sifted again with the baking powder to insure their being thoroughly 
blended. In making fruit cakes add the fruit before putting in the flour, 
as this will prevent it falling to the bottom of the cake. Flouring the 
fruit is unnecessary, unless the fruit is damp. If a cake cracks open 
while baking, the recipe contains too much flour. In creaming butter 
and sugar, when the butter is too hard to blend easily, warm the bowl 
and if necessary warm the sugar, but never warm the butter, as this will 
change both texture and flavor of the cake. The smaller the cake the 
hotter should be the oven. Large rich cakes require very slow baking. 
Grease cake pans with lard or drippings, as butter will be likely to make 
the cake stick, owing to the salt in it. 

When eggs are short in the Winter snow may be used as a substitute; 
one of The R. N.-Y. housewives says that one cupful of snow, beaten in 
after all the ingredients are put together, is equal to two eggs. 

Almond Cookies.^Cream together one-half cupful of butter and two 
cupfuls sugar. Stir in alternately a little at a time one cupful of sweet 
milk and twice sifted flour to make a dough which can be handled. With 
the last of the flour sift in two teaspoonfuls of baking powder; roll out 
one-quarter inch thick; before cutting out sprinkle with a cup of almonds 
which have been blanched and chopped and a teaspoon of granulated 
sugar mixed through them. Bake in quick oven. These should be eaten 
fresh, as should all cakes made without the addition of eggs. 

Angel Cake. — Four ounces and a heaping tablespoonful of flour, 12 
ounces of powdered sugar, the whites of 11 eggs beaten to a very stiff 
froth (flavor with rose before beating), a teaspoonful of cream of tartar 
and a little salt. Mix the sugar, flour, salt and cream of tartar together 
and sift through a very fine sieve six times. Then stir in lightly the

beaten whites. Bake in a neiv pan, without greasing, for 40 minutes. 
After taking from the oven, invert the pan and place upon cups or 
tumblers until the cake is cold, then remove and cover with a thin icing. 
No soda is used. A pan with a tin tube in the center is preferable for 
baking. 

Angel Cake No. 2.— Take the whites of nine large eggs. Add to 
them a pinch of salt and whip them lightly until they are partly stiff, 
then add half a teaspoonful of cream of tartar and whip them until very 
stiff. Fold in carefully one and one-fourth cupful of granulated sugar 
that has been sifted three times. Sift one cupful of the best pastry 
flour seven times (if you want a perfect cake), and fold it into the 
sugar and whipped eggs lightly. Last of all, add a teaspoonful of 
vanilla. Turn the cake into a large, unbuttered pan. Bake in a moderate 
oven from 35 to 50 minutes. Never open the oven door until you think 
the cake is done, as it falls very easily. On taking it from the oven 
turn it upside down in such a way that current of air will pass under 
it until it is cold. When cold loosen the cake from the sides of the pan 
and lift it out. It should be so delicately baked that this will not be 
difficult. If you intend to ice it cover it with a soft uncooked icing 
made with powdered sugar, white of egg and a very little vanilla. 
Angel cake is generally better for being kept a day before serving. If it 
is a little tough place it in a stone jar and cover with a plate. Let it 
stand for two or three days in this way and it will become tender. 

Apple Cake. — Measure two cupfuls of sifted flour, add two teaspoon- 
fuls of baking powder and half a teaspoonful of salt and sift again into 
a mixing bowl ; make a well in the center ; beat whites of two and yolk 
of one egg until light, add grated rind of a lemon, one tablespoonful of 
melted butter and a cupful of milk; mix this gradually into the flour 
until you have a thick batter or very soft dough. Spread this on shallow, 
well-buttered tins, having batter not more than half an inch thick. Pare 
and cut into eighths enough large, tart apples to cover the top of the 
cake by laying the pieces close together in rows, pressing the sharp edges 
into the dough; brush well with softened but not melted butter, sprinkle 
thickly with granulated sugar and bake in a hot oven. When done dust 
with powdered sugar and cinnamon. 

Dutch Apple Cake. — Measure a pint of sifted flour, add half a level 
teaspoonful salt, quarter of a cupful of sugar and a scant teaspoonful 
of soda. Sift three tim.es. Beat up one egg with a cupful of sour milk. 
Rub a third of a cupful of butter into the flour thoroughly; then mix 
in the liquid, making a soft dough. Spread this half an inch thick in a 
well-greased biscuit pan. Pare and core five juicy, nicely-flavored apples, 
and cut them into eighths; arrange them in parallel rows, sharp ed^es 
down, on top of the dough, pressing down so that they are partially 



92 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

imbedded in the dough. Sprinkle over thickly with sugar and a little 
cinnamon and spread with bits of butter. Bake in a quick oven for 25 
minutes. Serve hot as a dessert or tea cake. Made with fresh, ripe 
peaches cut in quarters, it is delicious. Omit the cinnamon when peaches 
are used. 

Apple Kuchen. — ^One pint of flour, one teaspoonful of cream of tartar, 
one-half teaspoonful of soda, one-half teaspoonful salt, an egg, a cupful 
of milk, two tablesponfuls of butter, four large apples. Sift salt, soda 
and cream of tartar with the flour and rub in the butter. Put the 
beaten egg into the milk and mix with the flour. Spread the dough 
one-half inch thick on a buttered pan. Cut the pared apples in eighths 
and stick into the dough in rows. Sprinkle with sugar and bake 25 
minutes. 

Apple Layer Cake. — One cupful of sugar creamed with half a cupful 
of butter; add the beaten yolks of four eggs, one-half cupful of milk, 
two cupfuls of flour, with two level teaspoonfuls of baking powder sifted 
through it. One teaspoonful of lemon or almond extract and the beaten 
whites of the eggs. Bake in three layers. When cold spread with this 
mixture: Peel and grate four large apples, beat into them one cupful of 
sugar, two teaspoonfuls of melted butter and two whipped eggs. Pour 
into a porcelain saucepan and stir steadily over a moderate fire until the 
mixture has boiled one minute. Remove from the fire, add two tea- 
spoonfuls of lemon juice, a dash of powdered cinnamon and two table- 
spoonfuls of minced almonds. Cool it and build the cake, sprinkling 
the top with powdered sugar. Cap the top generously with whipped 
cream, flavored, and serve at the table. 

Apple Sauce Cake. — ^One cup sugar, }^ cup shortening, one saltspoon 
salt, yi teaspoon ground cloves, one teaspoon cinnamon, yi teaspoon 
grated nutmeg, 1]4 cup raisins, more fruit if desired; one teaspoon soda 
dissolved in a little water, one cup unsweetened apple sauce. Put the 
dissolved soda into the sauce, let it foam over the ingredients; IJ4 cup 
flour; bake 45 minutes. 

Apricot Shortcake. — Drain the juice away from the fruit, and cut it 
in small pieces. Set in a warm place and proceed to mix the cake. This 
calls for one cupful of flour, four teaspoonfuls of baking powder, two 
teaspoonfuls of sugar, and half a teaspoonful of salt sifted together. 
Into this work four tablespoonfuls of butter, add three-fourths of a 
cupful of milk, and stir into a light dough. Roll in a floured bowl, and 
when one-fourth of an inch thick cut into generous squares. Brush 
the squares with melted butter, lay one on top of the other, and bake in 
a hot oven. When done separate the pieces, spread the fruit between the 
layers and on top, and pile whipped cream over all. A sweet sauce which 
may be served with the shortcake is made by adding to a cupful of the 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 93 

fruit juice one tablespoonful of cornstarch wet in a little water and 
boiled for a few minutes. A tablespoonful of butter is melted into the 
sauce and a tablespoonful of lemon juice is added just before serving. 

Bath Cake. — One cup of sugar, one-half cup of butter, two-thirds of 
a cup of sweet milk, whites of four eggs beaten to a stiff froth, two cups 
of flour, one teaspoonful of baking powder and one-fourth teaspoonful 
of 'baking soda. Flavor with vanilla. Bake in square, shallow tins (two 
will be required). These cakes should be iced in the tins, while warm, 
and glazed in a hot oven. Then score the icing (without cutting the 
cake or allowing the icing to harden) into two-inch squares, placing in 
the center of each square one-half of an English walnut. Set away 
in tins in a cool place until thoroughly cold, when the squares may be 
cut out. These little cakes look very pretty and are quite a delicacy. 

Black Angel Cake. — One tgg, half a cupful of sweet milk, half j 
cupful of sugar, one-third cake Baker's unsweetened chocolate. Cook 
these ingredients till it thickens and let cool while making the cake part 
as follows : One cupful of sugar, half cupful butter cream,ed, two eggs 
beaten separ?tely, half cupful sweet milk, two cupfuls flour, half tea- 
spoonful soda in the milk (do not use any cream of tartar), half 
teaspoonful vanilla. Mix the cake thoroughly, then add the chocolate 
paste and beat well. Bake in two layers and put together with white 
icing. This is a delicious cake. 

Black Cake, Inexpensive. — Beat one cup of butter with one cup of 
brown sugar until creamy; add two well-beaten eggs, one cup of cold 
coffee, three-fourths of a cup of molasses, one cup of seeded raisins, 
one cup of currants, quarter of a pound of citron shredded and a tea- 
spoonful each of ground cloves, allspice and cinnamon sifted with four 
cups of browned flour and two teaspoonfuls of baking powder. Mix 
the fruit in with the butter and sugar instead of flouring it to prevent 
the fruit from sinking when brown flour is used in the cake. A little 
flour may be required to make the batter stiff, as browning the flour 
lessens the thickening property. 

Blackberry Jam Cake.— One and one-quarter cupful of sugar; one- 
half cupful butter; four eggs; four tablespoonfuls of loppered milk; one 
small teaspoonful soda; two cupfuls flour; one teaspoonful of cinnamon; 
one quarter cloves and nutmeg. Stir in one cupful of blackberry jam. 
Bake in layers. Put together with a white frosting. 

Blueberry Cakes.— Measure three cupfuls of sifted flour, add three 
teaspoonfuls of baking powder, a heaping tablespoonful of sugar and a 
teaspoonful of salt; sift well together. Beat one egg until light; add 
iy2 cupful of milk. Make a well in the center of the flour and gradually 
pour in the liquid, stirring in the flour. In this way you can keep the 
batter smooth. Make it to the consistency of cake batter. Melt two 



94 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

level tablespoonfuls of butter and add to the batter; then two cupfuls of 
floured blueberries. Bake in the little custard cups or muffin rings, 
allowing a little longer time than for plain muffins. Blackberries are 
nice used in this way. 

Bohemian Butter Kuchen.— Dissolve one cake of dry yeast in a half 
cup of warm milk; then add another cup of warm milk, one and one-half 
cups of flour, one-half teaspoon of salt and beat to a smooth batter; let 
rise till very light. Cream together half a cup of butter, half a cup of 
sugar, two eggs and the grated rind of a lemon. Add this to the sponge 
and enough flour to make a soft dough. Let rise again to double its 
size; divide into three parts (handle as little as possible). Put each part 
in a shallow buttered pan and let rise again to double its height. Pour 
over each two tablespoonfuls melted butter, sprinkle with three table- 
spoonfuls of sugar and a little cinnamon. Bake 25 minutes. 

Brownie's Cake.— One cupful of brown sugar beaten to a cream with 
half a cupful of butter; add the well-beaten yolks of four eggs and 
half a cupful of strong cold coffee. Ground cloves, cinnamon, allspice 
and nutmeg to taste; 2^/2 cupfuls of flour sifted with two teaspoonfuls of 
baking powder, and last of all the whites of the eggs beaten to a stiff 
froth and folded in. Bake in two layers and fill in and ice with dark 
caramel icing, made as follows : Put four cupfuls of brown sugar in a 
saucepan with a cupful of sweet cream or rich milk and boil until it will 
thread from a spoon. Take from the fire and beat until nearly cold and 
then put between the layers and over the cake. 

Butter Cookies. — Cream together one cupful of butter and one-half 
cupful of light brown sugar ; then add one teaspoonful of vanilla and one 
well-beaten egg. Slowly stir in two cupfuls of flour. Mold lightly with 
the hand. Take out a small portion of the dough each time ; roll as thin 
as a silver dollar, cut the cookies with a cutter no larger than the dollar. 
Bake in a moderate oven until a golden brown. This will make one 
pound and a quarter of rich, crisp cookies. 

Butternut Cake. — Beat half a cup of butter to a cream. Gradually 
beat in J4 of a cup of granulated sugar, and then one cup of butternut 
meats and one egg beaten without separating. Sift together two cups of 
entire wheat flour, one-third of a cup of pastry flour, one-half teaspoon- 
ful soda, one- fourth teaspoonful salt, one-half teaspoonful mace, one- 
fourth teaspoonful cloves, and J4 teaspoonful cinnamon. Add this to 
the first mixture alternately with one cup of sour milk. Beat thoroughly 
and turn into little tins fitted with rounds of paper on the bottoms and 
thoroughly buttered. Bake about 25 minutes. The recipe makes 18 
cakes. When cold, ice with the icing made of brown sugar, and deco- 
rate with halves of butternut meats. The icing is made as follows : 
Boil one cup of brown sugar and one-third cup of water to 240 de-

grees Fahrenheit. Then pour in a fine .stream on to the white of one 
egg, beaten very light. Continue the beating while the syrup is being 
added to the egg and for some minutes afterward. Without a ther- 
mometer, to decide the temperature, boil the sugar until it spins a thread 
about three inches in length. 

Chocolate Cake. — Two eggs, one-half cup butter, one-half cup coc6a, 
one cup milk, one cup sugar, two teaspoonfuls baking powder ; two tea- 
spoonfuls vanilla, a good cup and one-half of flour. If it is not the 
proper consistency, then add a little more flour. 

Chocolate Cream Cake. — Use any good cake recipe and bake in a 
square pan. When cold cover with the following icing : To one and one- 
half cupful of sugar add one-half cupful of sweet milk. Place on stove 
and cook, after it begins to boil, for four minutes. Do not stir it. Pour 
cut on a platter and beat until thick enough to spread on the cake. 
While making this frosting have one and one-half square of chocolate 
melting, and after covering the cake with the frosting spread the choco- 
late smoothly over it. 

Coffee Cake. — Cream one-quarter cup of butter with one cup of sugar, 
add one egg beaten, one-half cup milk, a pinch of salt and one and one- 
half cupfuls of sifted flour with a teaspoonful of baking powder. Spread 
in pan and sprinkle with seeded and cleaned raisins or currants, a little 
Shredded citron, dot with butter and sift over sugar and cinnamon. Bake 
one-half hour and serve hot. 

Coffee Chocolate Cake. — Cream one cup of sugar and half a cup of 
butter; add the yolks of four eggs and half a cup of strong cold coffee. 
Sift in 1^ cup of flour with two teaspoonfuls of baking powder. Lastly 
stir in V/i square of melted chocolate. Bake in a loaf and ice with white 
frosting. 

Coffee Fruit Cake. — This requires neither eggs nor milk. One-half 
cup butter, one and one-half cups sugar, one and one-half cups cold 
strong coffee, one-half cup molasses, one teaspoonful soda, one cup rai- 
sins, one teaspoonful cinnamon, one teaspoonful cloves, one-half teaspoon- 
ful nutmeg. Flour for thick batter, adding one level teaspoonful baking 
powder. For frosting without eggs, use one cupful of granulated sugar, 
five tablespoonfuls of milk; boil four or five minutes till it threads from 
the spoon. Flavor as desired. Add chocolate or not. Stir till right 
thickness for spreading. This is fine-grained, white (if chocolate is not 
used) and delicious. 

Cornstarch Cake. — Two cups of white sugar and one cup oi butter 
creamed together. One cup of sweet milk, the whites of five eggs beaten 
very stiff, one cup of cornstarch, two cups of flour, two teaspoonfuls of 
baking powder and two of extract of lemon. Bake slowly in a moderate

beaten into one cupful sugar, adding one tablespoonful melted butter, one- 
half teaspoonful each of salt and cinnamon, one square grated chocolate. 
Mix well and then add one cupful sweet milk, three cupfuls of flour 
sifted with two teaspoonfuls baking powder. Roll out one-fourth inch 
thick, cut, cook to a golden brown in smoking hot fat. Roll in powdered 
sugar when cool. 

Crullers, Olive Oil. — To one-half cup of sugar add two tablespoons of 
oi), two beaten eggs, one-half teaspoon of salt, one-fourth teaspoon of 
cinnamon and a little nutmeg; add two cups of flour sifted with two 
teaspoons of baking powder, alternately with one-fourth cup of milk. 
Roll out, cut and fry as usual. In frying them let the oil get just hot 
enough to smoke. 

Date Cake. — Two cupfuls sugar, one cupful shortening, crearried to- 
gether, three eggs, well beaten into sugar and shortening, three teaspoon- 
fuls baking powder, 3J4 cupfuls flour. To this add one cupful of stoned 
and finely-chopped dates, floured. Bake in five layers and put together 
with plain or boiled icing. 

Dolly Varden Cake. — Cream one-half cup butter with one cup sugar. 
Add one-half cup milk alternately with one and one-half cup of flour 
in which has been mixed one teaspoonful baking powder. Lastly fold 
in the dry-beaten whites of three eggs and flavor to taste. Bake in loaf 
for one-half hour in a moderately quick oven. For icing make a syrup 
of one and one-half cup sugar and eight tablespoonfuls water. Boil, 
when this strings from spoon, add the well-beaten yolks of three eggs 
and continue beating for one-half hour. Flavor like cake and pour 
thickly over the cake. 

Doughnuts, Best.— One egg beaten light; one cupful of sugar and a 
little salt; one cupful of sour milk sweetened with one teaspoonful of 
soda; two tablespoonfuls of melted lard; flour to make a stiflf dough. 
Fry in hot lard, and dust with cinnamon and granulated sugar. These 
doughnuts are light and wholesome. 

Doughnuts, Potato.— Two cups of mashed potatoes (hot), four ta- 
blespoonfuls of shortening, three cupfuls of sugar, four eggs, five tea- 
spoonfuls of baking powder, three cupfuls milk, salt, nutmeg, and lastly 
flour enough to stiffen. Make a cream of potatoes, shortening, sugar and 
eggs, then add milk, salt and nutmeg, flour sifted with baking powder, 
and cook in boiling lard. 

Dried Apple Cake.— Soak the dried apples over night and in the morn- 
ing chop fine, having two cupfuls; then simmer in two cupfuls of mola&ses 
until apples are soft. Cream two cupfuls of sugar with a scant cupful 
of butter; add three well beaten eggs; then the apples and molasses; 
half a pound of raisins seeded, three cupfuls of flour, sifted with two 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 97 

teaspoonfuls baking powder and half a teaspoonful each of cinnamon, 
cloves and grated nutmeg. Bake in very moderate oven as you would 
fruit cake. 

Dutch Cake. — Take two pounds of raised bread dough, one pint of 
sugar, half a cupful of butter (or more if it is to be made quite rich), 
half a nutmeg grated, one teaspoonful of cinnamon and a pound of large 
laisins. Mix well and put in a greased pan. Let it rise about three- 
quarters of an hour, or until the loaf is nearly double its original size, 
and bake in a moderate even. This is very good when fresh; if we wish 
to make it richer we use an egg, which is mixed in with the butter. Us- 
ing currants instead of raisins, we have the English currant loaf. The 
same recipe makes very nice buns. 

Election Cake. — Rub into half a pound of sifted flour five ounces of 
butter, add a saltspoonful of salt, one cupful of sugar; mix. Scald two 
cupfuls of milk, and when lukewarm add one yeast cake dissolved, and 
two eggs well beaten. Make a hole in the center of the flour, pour in 
the milk mixture, stir in a little of the flour; cover and stand aside for 
three hours. Then beat in all the flour, add the juice of three oranges, 
a tablespoonful of cinnamon and half a nutmeg grated; turn into a 
greased round pan and, when very light, bake in a moderate oven for 
one hour. 

Eggless Cake. — Beat one cupful of sugar and half a cupful of butter 
to a cream ; add a cupful of milk, measure two cupfuls of sifted flour, 
add three teaspoonfuls of baking powder, a level teaspoonful of cinna- 
mon, half a teaspoonful of grated nutmeg and a pinch of cloves. Sift 
several times until the flour is light and fluffy, then stir into the other 
materials, add cupful seeded floured raisins. Bake in moderate oven. 

E^less Cake with Oil. — Cream one-half cup oil and one cupful sugar, 
one cupful sour milk, one teaspoonful soda, one teaspoonful each of cas- 
sia and cloves, one-half cupful chopped raisins (if desired) one-half 
teaspoonful salt, two cupfuls warmed flour. Be sure not to forget the 
salt, as the oil contains none. This must always be remembered ; in using 
the oil add twice as much salt as common. 

Eggless Fruit Cake.— One cup of sugar, one cup of butter, one cup of 
buttermilk, two cups of sifted flour, one cup of raisins (seeded and 
chopped), one teaspoonful of cinnamon, one-half teaspoonful of cloves, 
one-half teaspoonful of nutmeg. Beat the sugar and butter to a cream; 
dissolve the soda in a little hot water and stir it into the milk, and add 
next the spices. Flour the raisins and add them last. Bake in a well-but- 
tered tin, on the bottom of v/hich place a clean white paper, also well 
buttered. 

Layer Cake Without Eggs.— One cupful of sugar, quarter of a cupful 
of butter, one cupful of sweet milk, one teaspoonful of soda, two of 



98 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

cream of tartar, one tablespoonful of cornstarch made smooth in a httle 
milk, two cupfuls of flour. Bake in thin sheets and put together with 
boiled sugar frosting, jelly, cocoanut or any other rich filling desired, 
finish the top with the boiled sugar frosting made by boiling together a 
cupful of sugar and one of water until it will turn creamy white and 
thick on being stirred. This is quite as delicious as the frosting made 
from the whites of eggs. 

Noel Fruit Cake.— This contains neither butter nor eggs. One pound 
fat salt pork chopped fine, one cupful brown sugar, one cupful New Or- 
leans molasses in which is dissolved one teaspoonful of soda, one pound 
each of raisins, currants and figs chopped fine, one-fourth pound of 
citron chopped fine, one wineglass of coffee (substituted for brandy), 
214 cupfuls of flour well browned. This will make one large loaf or two 
small ones. The longer kept the better it is. This may be iced or not. 
A boiled milk frosting is good while eggs are high. 

Eggless Waffles.— Mix at night a batter with sour milk if you have 
it; if not, sweet will answer. To each quart of milk, with flour for bat- 
ter, add one tablespoonful each of butter and sugar, one-half teaspoonful 
salt. If sweet milk is used add small quantity yeast or one-quarter com- 
pressed yeast cake. In the morning add enough baking soda to correct 
acidity— you will have to try baking a little to get it right. 

Russian Fried Cakes. — Scald one pint of milk, add one scant tea- 
spoonful of salt and one tablespoonful of sugar; when lukewarm add 
one yeast cake dissolved in a little warm water, and sufficient flour to 
make a drop batter, and set aside to rise. When light and spongy add 
one-half cupful of butter, creamed together with one cupful of sugar 
and three eggs ; beat until thoroughly mixed ; add sufficient flour to 
make a soft dough and knead for five minutes. Return to the bowl; 
cover and keep in a warm place until light. Turn out on a floured board; 
roll out quite thin and cut into three-inch circles. On one-half of these 
cakes place a small spoonful of any firm jam or marmalade. Cover with 
the remaining cakes and pinch each together securely. Cover with a 
floured cloth, and let stand for 20 minutes; then drop a few at a time 
into smoking hot fat. When well browned and puffed up draw on un- 
glazed paper and roll in powdered sugar. 

Fruit Cake. — Three pounds flour, - one pound butter, y^ pound lard, 
two pounds stoned raisins, two pounds currants, one pound mixed can- 
died peel, sliced, two teaspoonfuls each of ground allspice, cinnamon, 
cloves, nutmeg and ginger; two pounds brown sugar; a little salt; one 
cup milk; eight eggs; two teaspoonfuls baking powder. If all baked 
in one loaf bake for four hours. 

Graham Fruit Cake. — Sift three cups of sifted graham flour, two cups 
of white flour, one teaspoon each of ' clove, allspice, soda and salt and 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 99 

two teaspoons of cinnamon. To two cups of sugar add one cup of mo- 
lasses and two cups of milk alternately with the sifted flour mixture. 
Beat thoroughly and add three cups each of seeded raisins and citron, 
both slightly floured. Bake in a moderate oven for one hour. 

Maple Sugar Fruit Cake.— Cream one cupful of butter and add to it 
two cupfuls of maple sugar, one of maple syrup, three beaten eggs, one 
small cupful of milk with a rounding teaspoonful of soda dissolved in it, 
five cupfuls of flour sifted with two teaspoonfuls of cream tartar and a 
little salt. Mix all together and add one pound of raisins, one of cur- 
rants, half a pound of citron and a quarter of a pound of orange peel, 
all well floured. No spices are used, as the maple sugar flavors the 
cake. 

Old-Fashioned Fruit Cake. — This is intended for rolling out and bak- 
ing in flat pans, instead of the usual loaf. Take two and a half cupfuls 
of sugar, creamed up with half a cupful of butter, half a cupful of sour 
milk, a teaspoonful of soda, half a teaspoonful each of cinnamon, nut- 
meg and ground cloves, a cupful of raisins and one of currants, with a 
little chopped citron and enough flour to make quite stiff. Knead all 
together, roll about two inches thick and bake in a moderate oven. 
Spread the layers with boiled sugar frosting and cut into squares before 
the frosting hardens. 

Poor Man's Fruit Cake. — Seed and chop a quarter of a pound of 
dates; mix with them one cupful of seeded raisins, and dust them with 
one-half cupful of flour. Dissolve a level teaspoonful of baking soda in 
two tablespoonfuls of warm water; add to it half a pint of very thick 
sour cream, stir a moment and add one cupful of brown sugar, half a 
tumblerful of currant or blackberry jelly, a tablespoonful of cinnamon, a 
teaspoonful of allspice and two cupfuls and a half of flour. Beat thor- 
oughly, add the fruit, mix well and turn into a greased square pan. Bake 
in a very slow oven for one hour and a half. This cake will be quit^e 
equal to plain fruit cake if the cream is very thick, and it is allowed to 
stand a week before cutting. 

German Cookies. — To one cup of sugar, one cup of butter, one cup 
of lard, one cup of molasses, the juice and grated rind of one lemon, 
one tablespoonful of vinegar, one teaspoonful each of cinnamon and 
ginger, one and one-half teaspoonful of soda, add one egg, one cup of 
nuts, one tablespoonful each of candied citron and orange peel chopped 
fine and flour enough to make stiflF. The dough must be stiff or the 
cookies will not retain the shape in baking. 

Colonial Gingerbread. — Put a cupful of New Orleans molasses in a 
mixing bowl with half a cupful of butter and half a cupful of sugar. 
Over this pour a cupful of boiling water in which a level dessertspoonful 
of soda has already been dissolved. Stir well, and let the mixture 



100 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

cool; then add a cupful of chopped walnuts and a cupful of seeded rai- 
sins, a teaspoonful each of cinnamon and ginger, two and one-half cup- 
fuls of flour, and, lastly, two well-beaten eggs. Bake in a shallow pan 
and serve while still warm from the oven. 

Honey Gingerbread. — Wami a generous half cup of butter and beat 
into it two cups of strained honey. When you have a light cream beat 
in one tablespoon of powdered sugar, a tablespoon of ginger and one- 
half teaspoon of cinnamon. Add the beaten yolks of four eggs, and al- 
ternately with the frothed whites, three even cups of flour sifted twice 
with one teaspoon of baking powder. Beat hard for one minute and 
bake in buttered shallow pans for 45 minutes. Keep covered for 30 
minutes. 

Shiny Gingerbread. — This is very crackly and shiny on top. The 
secret of making it thus is to pour the shortening boiling hot on the 
molasses and beat the batter as little as possible. Pour a small half- 
teacupful of boiling hot shortening, lard and butter, or beef suet and 
butter mixed, upon one-half pint of New Orleans molasses; add two 
lablespoonfuls of milk; a tablespoonful of ground ginger, a teaspoonful 
of cinnamon; then sift in about three-quarters of a pint of flour, to 
which a teaspoonful of baking soda has been added; lastly add a well- 
beaten egg, then mix with a few deft turns of the spoon and bake in one 
large pan or two small ones in a moderate oven; serve hot, and break, 
not cut, at the table. 

Ginger Snaps. — Beat together one cupful of sugar, one egg, and one 
tablespoonful of ginger. Heat one cupful of molasses to the scalding 
point, stir into it one teaspoonful of soda or saleratus, and, while it 
foams, pour it over the butter and egg, and beat together. Add a table- 
spoonful of vinegar, and stir in lightly enough flour to roll out and cut 
the dough. 

Half-Pound Cake.^One pound of sugar, one pound of flour, one-half 
pound of butter, one teacupful of milk, four eggs. Flavor to taste. Whip 
up the sugar and eggs, putting in one egg at a time. Then stir in the 
milk and flavoring, following this with the flour, which must be very 
thoroughly beaten into the batter. Pour into paper-lined tins and bake 
in a steady oven for 45 minutes. This quantity should make two loaves. 
The oven must be well regulated, and care taken to avoid any jar, or 
the cake will be apt to fall in the middle. 

Hardenburg Cake.— This is an old-fashioned Dutch fruit cake. 
Cream together a pound and a half of butter and two pounds of gran- 
ulated sugar. Add one-half pint of New Orleans molasses, the beaten 
yolks of 13 eggs, two ounces of mixed spices— mace, cinnamon and 
cloves, two grated nutmegs, one-half pound candied peel— two pounds 
cleansed and dried currants, four pounds stoned and cut raisins one- 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 101 

half pint pickled fruit sjTup or boiled-down cider, and flour to make the 
ingredients hang together. If not self-raising flour, add a dessertspoonful 
of baking powder. About a pound and a quarter of flour will be re- 
quired. Lastly, fold in the stifHy beaten whites of the eggs. Bake three 
or four hoiirs in a moderate even, taking care not to disturb. 

Honey Apple Cake. — Wash two cupfuls of dried apples (old-fash- 
ioned kind are the best) and soak them over night. Next morning drain 
them and mince as fine as possible and simmer for two hours in a pint 
of honey. Pour into a bowl and add while hot half a cupful of butter, 
stir until butter is melted and mixed, then let cool. Add a cupful of 
sifted sugar and half a cupful of milk, a teaspoonful each of cloves and 
cinnamon, the grated rind of half a lemon, two eggs well beaten and 
two cupfuls of flour in which you have mixed two teaspoonfuls of baking 
powder. Line long, shallow tins with buttered paper and pour in the 
batter to depth of half an inch. When baked cut into strips size of 
lady fingers and dust the surface with powdered sugar. 

Hot Cross Buns.-^Sift into a large bowl one full quart of flour, half 
a cupful of sugar, and half a teaspoonful of salt; dissolve one-fourth 
of a cupful of butter in a generous half-pint of warm milk, and add to 
the dry ingredients, with the yolks of two beaten eggs; add half a 
yeast cake dissolved in a little water, half a nutmeg grated, and the 
whites of the two eggs, beaten stiff; this should make a very soft dough. 
Cover the bowl with a clean cloth, place . it where it will keep warm, 
and let it rise over night. Li the morning take pieces of the dough the 
size of an egg and, with a little flour, mold them into round cakes an 
inch in thickness. Place them on a buttered tin, leaving a little space 
between. Cover the tins and set in a warm place for the buns to rise; 
they should be double their original size. With a sharp knife cut a 
cross in the center of each bun. Bake them in a moderate oven for 
about half an hour. When the buns are baked, brush the top with a 
syrup made of sugar and water. A few currants or a little candied 
peel is usually added to this recipe. 

Icing, Plain. — Dissolve one cupful of granulated sugar in one-quarter 
of a cupful of hot water; flavor with essence of vanilla or some orange 
juice and cook until it threads. Then pour it slowly over the whipped 
white of an egg, beating the mixture all the time until cool. 

Imperial Cake. — One pound of sugar, one pound of flour, three-quar- 
ters pound of butter, one pound of .almonds, blanched and cut fine; one- 
half pound of citron, one-quarter pound candied cherries, one-half pound 
of seeded raisins, rind and juice of one lemon, two pieces of candied 
orange, one nutmeg, 10 eggs. Bake in a loaf in a moderate oven. This 
is a rich and delicious cake, that can be made some time before it is used. 

Grandmother's Jumbles.— Work three-quarters of a pound of butter 



102 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

into a pound and a half of flour and half a pound of sugar. Flavor with 
grated nutmeg, cinnamon or lemon extract, and add three well beaten 
eggs. Work all well together into a smooth paste and roll out an eighth 
of an inch in thickness. Sprinkle crushed loaf sugar over it and cut into 
round cakes with a very smjll cutter; take out the center. Lay on bak- 
ing sheets and bake in a quick oven, without browning, about 10 minutes. 
Jumbles Without Eggs. — ^A half cupful each of butter and slightly 
soured milk, one cupful of sugar, a half teaspoonful of soda, saltspoonful 
of salt, the same of nutmeg and cinnamon mixed, the grated yellow rind 
of half a lemon, and a teaspoonful of lemon juice, two cupfuls of flour 
to stiffen. Bake in rings in a hot oven. A cupful of clean, light, new- 
fallen snow stirred into cake, or other batters, briskly, the very last thing 
before turning it into the baking pan, is a good substitute for eggs. When 
snow is used a little more flour is required — about two tablespoonfuls. 

Lady Baltimore Cake. — One cupful of butter, two cupfuls of sugar, 
three and one-half cupfuls of flour, one cupful sweet milk, the whites 
of six eggs, two level teaspoonfuls of baking powder and a teaspoonful 
of rose water. Mix as directed for white cakes and bake in three layers, 
with this filling: Dissolve three cupfuls of granulated sugar in\one cup- 
ful of boiling water, cook until it threads, then pour gradually over the 
stiffly-beaten whites of three eggs, stirring constantly. Add to this icing 
one cupful of chopped raisins, one cupful of chopped nut meats (pecans 
preferred), and five figs cut in very thin strips. Ice and emboss top and 
sides of cake. 

Lady Fingers.— Beat the whites of three eggs until very stiff, then beat 
in gradually one-third of a cup of sugar and just a bit of salt. Beat the 
yolks of three eggs until light and thick and add to the whites, putting 
in at the same time a little vanilla extract. Fold in one-third of a cup 
of flour. Shape on a buttered tin to resemble those sold in the shops; 
that is, make them very thin and about four and one-half inches long by 
one inch wide. Dust with confectioner's sugar and bake in a moderate 
oven. About eight minutes will be required for the baking. 

Lebkuchen. — Take a cupful of butter and one of sugar, pour over them 
two cupfuls of honey heated to the boiling point. Add a generous handful 
of blanched almonds, a grated nutmeg and a teaspoonful of cinnamon. 
Dissolve a scant teaspoonful of soda in water and add to the ingre- 
dients. Mix with flour until the dough is as stiff as for ginger cookies. 
Roll out like cookies. Cut into oblong cakes and bake until well 
browned. 

Lemon Sponge Cake.— Three eggs, one-half cupful granulated sugar, 
one-half cupful of sifted flour, the juice and grated rind of one lemon, 
one-half teaspoonful of baking powder. Beat the whites of eggs very 
stiff, beat the yolks and add. When well mixed add the sugar slowly 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 103 

and beat; grate the outside of rind of lemon and add the juice, then 
beat all with egg beater three minutes. Sift in the flour m which the 
baking powder has been mixed and stir slowly and carefully, but do not 
beat after flour is in. Bake in a moderate oven 35 minutes. 

Maple Layer Cake. — Make a tender layer cake by any good recipe, and 
bake in three large layers. For a filling take two cupfuls of maple su- 
gar, add one cup of water and boil until it will wax when dropped in 
cold water. Then remove from the fire and add two teaspoonfuls of but- 
ter and stir speedily till it will spread on the cake. Add one-half tea- 
spoonful of vanilla and put between the layers. 

Molasses Cookies. — Take one cupful of sugar and one cupful of but- 
ter or good shortening. Cream them and add two cups of molasses and 
two eggs. Dissolve two good-sized teaspoonfuls of soda in a little hot 
v/ater, and fill up the cup it is in with cold water. Add it to the other 
mixture and stir in enough flour to make a soft dough, but one that can 
be rolled out and cut into cookies. Spice to suit the taste. 

Delicious Nut Cake. — Cream half a cupful of sugar, adding the stiffly 
beaten whites of three eggs and beating very light; then add, by alter- 
nate bits, two-thirds of a cupful of milk and one and a half cupfuls of 
flour mixed with two level teaspoonfuls of baking powder. At the last 
turn in a cupful of minced , English walnut meat and bake in a shallow 
tin. When the cake is cool cover with icing, mark in squares and put 
nut meat on the top of each. 

Nut Wafers. — ^Two eggs, one cup of sugar, two tablespoonfuls of 
flour, one cup of nut meats chopped fine. Hickorynuts are preferred, 
and the sugar should be light brown. Spread the mixture in a very thin 
layer on a well-greased tin and bake ten minutes or until well tinged 
with brown. Cut in squares and remove from the tin as soon as they are 
done, that the wafers may grow crispy in the air. 

Oatmeal Cookies. — Cream three-fourths of a cupful of butter with one 
cupful of sugar; add two well-beaten eggs. Sift three-fourths of a tea- 
spoonful of soda into two cupfuls of flour; add one-half a teaspoonful 
of salt, one teaspoonful of cinnamon; now add to the mixture two cup- 
fuls of uncooked rolled oats, and one scant cupful of chopped raisins 
sprinkled with a little flour. Drop by the teaspoonful into a greased 
pan; bake in moderate oven. 

Oatmeal Crisps. — One table.<-.poonful of butter, creamed, one cup of 
sugar, added gradually; two and one-half cups rolled oats; two teaspoons 
baking powder well mixed with the oats; two eggs, well beaten, one- 
half teaspoon of salt and two teaspoons vanilla in the eggs. Mix in the 
order given; bake in a medium to slow oven. A heaping teaspoonful of 
mixture makes a dainty crisp. Allow room for them to spread in the 
pan. If you cannot get on without flour use a little best bread flour- 
not pastry. 



104 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Oatmeal Macaroons. — Cream two level tablespoonfuls of butter, scant 
measure; add gradually half a cup of sugar, then the beaten yolks of 
two large eggs beaten again with half a cup of sugar. Then stir in 2^ 
cupfuls of rolled oats, mixed with 2^ level teaspoonfuls of baking 
powder and one-fourth teaspoonful of salt. Flavor with one teaspoonful 
of vanilla, then fold in the whites of two eggs, beaten dry. Drop with a 
teaspoon on to a buttered baking-sheet, making little rounds about three 
inches apart, and bake in a slow oven. 

Orange Cake. — Sift together four times V/2 cupful of flour and V/2 
teaspoonful of baking powder. Beat well two eggs, add one cupful of 
sugar, one-half cupful of milk, one tablespoohful of melted butter and 
the same quantity of orange juice; then the sifted flour and baking pow- 
der. Bake in a square, shallow tin. When cooked split open and fill 
with a cream made as follows: Into a cup squeeze the juice of one 
orange, add a tablespoonful of lemon juice and hot water to fill the cup, 
put this on to cook in a double boiler, thicken with one tablespoonful of 
cornstarch wet with cold water, and add the grated rind of half an 
orange, one teaspoonful of butter, two heaping tablespoonfuls of sugar 
and the yolk of an egg. 

Othello Cake, or Devil's Food. — Part first — One cupful of dark brown 
su.gar; one-half cupful of butter; one egg and yolks of two; one-half 
cupful sweet milk; one teaspoonful soda, two cupfuls flour, measured 
before sifting; two teaspoonfuls vanilla extract. Part second — One cup- 
ful dark brown sugar, one cupful grated chocolate, one-half cupful sweet 
milk. Grate the chocolate, add milk and sugar, put in a double boiler, 
and place on the back of stove until dissolved; but do not boil. Prepare 
this first and have dissolving while preparing part first. To mix part 
first, cream the butter, sugar and eggs, together, dissolve the soda in milk, 
and add to butter and sugar. Add the flour tablespoonful at a time 
until all is in, beating lightly. Beat part secoTid into part first and bake 
in two layers. 

Panoche Cake. — Make any good white cake, and bake in two layers. 
Make a filling as follows : Boil together two cupfuls of brown sugar and 
one-half cupful milk until they harden in cold water. Then add a tea- 
spoonful of vanilla and a tablespoonful of butter. Stir while cooking. 
To half of this mixture add one-half cupful of English walnut meats; as 
soon as cool enough spread between the layers. Spread the remainder 
of the mixture on top of the cake, and decorate with half walnut meats. 

Peanut Cookies.— One-half cupful of butter, one cupful granulated 
sugar, one-half cupful milk, one egg, one pint flour, two teaspoonfuls 
baking powder, one heaping cupful chopped peanuts. Cream the butter 
and sugar, add the milk and egg— beating white and yolk separately— 
ihen the baking powder mixed with part of the flour, and lastly the re- 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 105 

mainder of the flour, in which has been mixed the nuts. Handle very 
I'ttle and do not roll too thin. 

Pork Cake. — One pound of fat salt pork, chopped fine, and dissolved 
i'^ one pint of boiling water, three cups of brown sugar, one cup mo- 
lasses, one pound each of raisins and currants, two tablespoonfuls of 
cinnamon, one teaspoonful cloves, two nutmegs grated, grated zest of one 
orange and lemon, one teaspoonful baking soda, two teaspoonfuls of 
cream of tartar, seven cups of sifted flour. Bake in moderate oven. 
This amount makes three medium-sized loaf cakes. 

Potato Cake. — Two cups sugar, one-half cup butter, one cup hot 
mashed potato, four eggs beaten, one-half cup milk, one-fourth tea- 
spoon nutmeg, one-fourth teaspoon cloves, one-half teaspoon cinnamon, 
one cup walnut meats chopped fine, two rounding cups flour, two tea- 
spoons baking powder, two ounces chocolate melted over hot water and 
mixed with potato; add to sugar and butter and mix as usual. Bake in 
three layers and put together with frosting. 

Pound Cake.- — Mix a pound of sugar with three-quarters of a pound 
of butter. When worked white, stir in the yolks of eight eggs beaten to 
a froth, then the whites. Add a pound of sifted flour and mace or nutmeg 
to taste. If you wish to have your cake particularly nice, stir in, just 
before you put it into the pans, a quarter of a pound of citron or al- 
monds blanched, and powdered fine in rosewater. 

Raised Cake. — Two cupfuls light sponge, one cupful sugar, one-half 
cupful butter, two well-beaten eggs, one cupful stoned raisins, floured, 
half a nutmeg, grated, one-half teaspoonful soda dissolved in a little 
water. Make into a loaf or loaves, and when light bake in rather slow 
oven, as it scorches easily. If desired, cover it with a milk icing, for 
which use 10 teaspoonfuls swpet milk, IJ^ cupful sugar. Boil six min- 
utes, take from stove and stir until quite white, flavor, spread quickly 
with a knife dipped in cold water. 

Raisin-Cake Squares. — Sift and dry half a pound of flour, rub into this 
two ounces of butter and a very little lard, add three ounces of sugar, a 
teaspoonful of baking powder and six ounces of stoned raisins. Beat 
two eggs with a spoonful of milk, and add to the dry ingredients; add 
a pinch of ground cinnamon and beat all to a light batter; pour into 
a greased pudding tin and bake in a sharp oven; when cooled a little 
cut with a hot knife into squares and serve while still warm. 

Rochester Cake.— Two cups sugar; two-thirds butter; one cup sweet 
milk; three eggs; three cups flour; two teaspoonfuls baking powder; a 
little salt and flavoring. Put half the mixture in two jelly cake pans. To 
the remainder add one tablespoon molasses; one cup chopped raisins or 
currants; one-fourth pound chopped citron; one teaspoon cinnamon; one- 
half teaspoon cloves; one-half teaspoon allspice; a little nutmeg; one 



106 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

tablespoon flour. Put in two other jelly cake pans. Put the cakes to- 
gether while warm with a little jelly or raspberry jam between tliem, 
dark and light layers alternately. 

Rose Layer Cake.— Two cups of sugar, one cup of butter, a fourth 
of a cup of sweet milk, whites of eight eggs beaten stiff, three and a 
fourth cups -of flour and two teaspoonfuls of baking powder. Bake in 
jelly tins. Grease the tins well and dust flour over every part before 
putting in the batter. Boil two cups of powdered sugar in a half tea- 
cupful of water, stirring constantly. When very thick pour boiling-hot 
over the beaten whites of two eggs. Beat until almost cold. Flavor 
with rose extract and color with cochineal. Put the cakes together with 
this icing. For the pink coloring matter, buy five cents' worth of baker's 
cochineal of the druggist, put half a teaspoonful into a cup and cover 
with two teaspoonfuls of boiling water. Let stand an hour, add alum 
(powdered) the size of a large pea, and add drop by drop to the icing 
until of a pretty pink color. 

Sour Cream Cake. — One cup sugar, one cup sour cream, three-fourths 
cup raisins, one level teaspoonful salt, two eggs, two cups flour, one tea- 
spoonful each of saleratus and cinnamon, a saltspoonful ground cloves 
Beat well, bake in loaf or two layers, and use any white frosting for 
covering the cake. For the sour cream icing, use one cup sour cream, 
one and one-half cup sugar (granulated), three-fourths cup ground 
walnuts and hickory nuts. Boil in granite pan to soft ball stage, then stir 
briskly until nearly cold. If this should prove too stiff, add a table- 
spoonful sweet milk. 

Salem Spice Cake. — Cream a half cupful of butter with a cupful of 
sugar, add two eggs — one at a time — and beat until the mixture is very 
light. Sift 1^ cupful of flour with one-fourth of a teaspoonful of salt, 
one teaspoonful of cinnamon and half a teaspoonful of cloves. Add the 
flour, a tablespoonful at a time, alternately with a half cupful of cold 
water, and add to the last tablespoonful of flour a teaspoonful of baking 
powder. Stir in a half cupful of cleaned and seeded raisins and bake in 
a shallow, well-greased pan in a moderate oven for 35 minutes. 

Spiced Molasses Wafers. — This is one of the daintiest gingerbreads. 
Oue cupful of brown sugar, one-half of a cupful of molasses, one table- 
spoonful of butter, one-half of a teaspoonful of powdered cinnamon, one- 
quarter of a teaspoonful of cloves, one-quarter of a teaspoonful of all- 
spice, two tablespoonfuls of flour. Put the molasses, sugar and butter in 
a saucepan and boil gently over the fire until, when tried in cold water, 
a little of the mixture can be rolled into a very soft ball between the 
fingers; cover and set aside until cold. Add the spice, then the flour, 
and a pinch of salt Butter liberally a number of shallow tins. Make 
a tester by dropping a teaspoonful of the mixture on a greased pan and 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 107 

baking it in a hot oven. This is necessary, as with some brands of flour 
a trifle more may be indicated. The mixture will spread very much and 
when taken from the oven the cake will be as thin as a wafer and should 
be taken at once from the pan. 

Berwick Sponge Cake. — Six eggs; powdered white sugar, three cup- 
f uls ; sifted flour, four even cupfuls ; cream of tartar,- two teaspoonfuls ; 
soda, one teaspoonful; one cupful cold water, one-half of a lemon. 
First beat the eggs two minutes, add the sugar and beat five minutes more, 
then stir the cream of tartar in two cupfuls of the flour and beat one 
minute; dissolve the soda in the water and add; wash the lemon dry, 
then grate the rind and squeeze in the juice. Finally, add the remaining 
two cupfuls of flour and beat all one minute. Put into deep pans in a 
moderate oven. This will make two bars, or loaves. When it is done 
it smells like fresh popcorn. There is considerable beating about this 
cake, and therein lies the success. You can use three tablespoonfuls 
baking powder (if you wish, in place of cream of tartar and soda), but 
sift it in the two last cupfuls of flour. Have about the same heat as 
for raised bread, put into the oven and let it remain certainly 20 min- 
utes without looking at it. If it can bake until done without the oven 
door being opened, so much the better. 

Boiled Sponge Cake. — One and one-half cupful granulated sugar, two- 
thirds cupful water, boiled until clear; pour over (beating while you 
pour) the whites of five eggs which have been beaten very stiff in a large 
platter; now beat until cold, and add yolk of eggs beaten- smooth," juice 
of a half lemon and one cupful of flour folded in gently. Bake in a slow 
oven about three-fourths hour. Bake in oblong pan about two to 2J4 
inches deep. Can be iced with any icing preferred, and will keep in- 
definitely. 

Never-Fail Sponge Cake. — This can be made and baked in 35 min- 
utes. A good sponge should be yellow as gold, of velvety softness and 
tender as a marshmallow. If the rule here given is strictly followed, 
such a cake will be the sure result: Separate the whites and yolks of 
four eggs. Beat the whites until stiff enough to remain in bowl if it is 
inverted, then beat into them one-half cup of sugar, which must be fine 
granulated (powdered sugar makes tough cake and proper beating does 
away entirely with the grains). Beat the yolks, add to them one-half 
cupful of sugar, beating for five minutes by the clock — this latter being 
important, as the delicate texture of the cake depends upon it; add to 
the yolks the grated rind and juice of one lemon. Now beat well to- 
gether the yolks and white. At this stage beating is in order, but must 
be absolutely avoided after adding the flour, of which take one cupful. 
The mixture should now look like a puff ball, and the flour- is to be 
tossed or stirred into it with a light turn of the wooden spoon. Stirring 



108 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

is quite different from beating. The cupful of sugar must be generous, 
the flour scanty. Bake for 25 minutes in a moderate oven. Just be- 
fore putting in the oven sprinkle on top through a sifter about a table- 
spoonful of granulated sugar. This gives the "crackly" top crust so 
desirable. 

Tory Wafers.— Melt a teacup of butter, a half a cup of lard, and mix 
them with a quart of flour, a couple of beaten eggs, a teaspoonful of 
salt, and flavoring. Add milk till of the right consistency to roll out; 
roll it out about the third of an inch in thickness, cut it into cakes with 
a cookie cutter, lay them on buttered baking plates, and bake them a 
few minutes. Frost them as soon as baked, and sprinkle comfits or 
sugar sand on the tor. 

Venetian Cake. — This makes a handsome loaf, and is very good. 
Beat together the yolks of six eggs and half a pint of sugar for 20 
minutes. Fold in the stiffly beaten whites and mix in lightly 4J^ 
rounded tablespoon fuls of flour. Pour into a buttered mold dusted 
with equal parts of flour and sugar. Bake half an hour, with an increas- 
ing heat, putting it into a moderate oven at first. When done invert it 
on the pastry rack, and when cold frost with a vanilla chocolate icing. 

Walnut Cake. — Cream two-thirds of a cupful of butter with gne 
cupful of sugar. Separate three eggs ; beat the yolks until creamy and 
add to butter and sugar; then add one cupful of milk alternating with 
three cupfuls of flour (reserve enough of the flour for the nuts), add two 
teaspoonfuls of baking powder, one cupful of nut kernels chopped, and 
last of all fold in the whites of the eggs beaten to a stiff froth. Bake 
in a loaf tin in a moderate oven from 45 minutes to one hour. 

Walnut Wafers. — One cup brown sugar, one cup chopped nuts, two 
eggs, one tablespoon butter, flour enough to make very thick dough 
(about eight tablespoonfuls), one teaspoon baking powder, vanilla. Beat 
sugar and yolks together, add nuts, butter and flour; lastly the whites 
beaten stiff and baking powder. Drop by one-half teaspoonful on but- 
tered tins, allowing room to spread. Bake in quick oven. 

Whigs.— Mix half a pound of sugar with six ounces of butter, a 
couple of beaten eggs, a teaspoonful of cinnamon. Stir in two pounds 
of flour, a teacup of yeast, and milk sufficient to make a thick batter. 
When light, bake them in small cups. 

White Fruit Cake.— The whites of 16 eggs, one pound each of sugar, 
flour and butter, one grated cocoanut, one pound chopped citron, one 
pound chopped blanched almonds, one wineglass of rose water, two tea- 
spoonfuls of baking powder. Flour citron and almonds well; bake care- 
fully. 



CHAPTER IX. 

EGGS. 

Eggs a la Bonne Femme. — Cut an onion into fine dice, fry it lightly in 
a tablespoonful of butter, then dash in a teaspoonful of vinegar. But- 
ter a shallow dish, sprinkle the fried onion over it, and break in five 
eggs, being very careful that the yolks remain whole. Bake in a hot 
oven until the whites become a delicate film. Dust with salt and white 
pepper. Just before sending to the table sprinkle all over the dish 
coarse bread crumbs fried delicately brown in butter, and garnish with 
watercress or parsley. 

A la Maitre d'Hotel. — Put the eggs in boiling water and boil six 
minutes; then take from the fire and dip in cold water, taking them 
out immediately; this is to render shelling easy. When shelled, cut the 
eggs through lengthwise and lay them on a hot dish on which maitre 
d'hotel butter has been melted. With a spoon cover the eggs with this 
sauce, which is made as follows : M"ix with a spoon on a plate a piece 
of butter the size of an egg with a tablespoonful of finely chopped par- 
sley, a pinch of salt, and pepper. Put it on a hot platter to melt. This 
sauce is often served with fish, broiled meat or boiled vegetables. It is 
very nice with new potatoes. Eggs boiled as above described are also 
very good with strained tomato, or parsley sauce, while another varia- 
tion is given by using black butter, sauce au beurre noir. To make this, 
brown half a cupful of butter in the frying pan as brown as it can be 
made without burning, then add two tablespoonfuls of vinegar, salt and 
pepper. This sauce is very good with fish also. 

Baked Eggs. — One large cupful of milk, add one teaspoonful of but- 
'cr (or more if wished), salt and pepper to taste, one teaspoonful of 
fiour, made smooth with a little extra milk. Boil about three minutes 
and pour in heated dish, then break in five fresh eggs and put in hot 
oven and bake until whites of eggs are set. 

Baked Eggs with Cheese.— Cut 12 hard boiled eggs in thick slices, 
and, having a buttered baking dish well sprinkled with dry crumbs, place 
a layer of eggs in the center. Sprinkle with grated cheese and season 
lightly with salt and paprika. Add another layer of eggs and cheese 
until the dish is filled, finishing with the cheese. Pour in a cream sauce 
thickened with the yolks of three eggs, sprinkle with fresh bread crumbs 
mixed with cheese, dot with butter and bake about 10 minutes in a l^Qt 
oven, or until the c-r«mbs are 3 golden yellow. Serve ^t oupe. 



110 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Baked Eggs With Mashed Potatoes.— The potatoes should be well sea- 
soned, and beaten smooth with hot cream or milk and butter, so they 
will be very light. Put m a buttered baking dish, and then with a 
small croquette mold (or if this 's lacking, with a clean egg) make 
deep little hollows in the potatoes. Drop an uncooked egg carefully 
into each of these hollows, dust with salt and pepper, and dot the ftop 
with bits of butter; set in the oven until the eggs are cooked, and serve 
at once. 

Creamed Eggs. — Boil six eggs for about eight minutes. Cool, remove 
shells, and cut into halves. Put two tablespoonfuls of butter in a 
saucepan and blend with the same amount of flour. Add a cup of 
water and stir until smooth. Put in some more butter, season with salt 
and pepper and a little lemon juice. Stir in the eggs and serve on toast. 

Eggs in Cream. — Use very thick cream, a dessert spoonful to each egg 
to cook them in. Put the cream in a large deep granite ware pie dish 
and set on top of the stove for a minute or two, until the cream gets thin. 
Then break in the eggs; sprinkle a little salt and white pepper over 
each egg, set the dish back on the stove, cover close and let stand two 
or three' minutes, or until the eggs are nicely set. These are most de- 
licious served with toast and coffee for breakfast. 

Mexican Eggs. — Peel and chop four or five ripe tomatoes and lay 
them in a shallow vegetable dish or on a platter on which the peppers 
are to be served. Remove the stems and seeds from six or eight very 
tender peppers, and if desired, the skins can be peeled off in this way. 
Put them into a dry frying pan over a moderate fire, moving them 
often until they are sufficiently wilted to allow the removal of the skins. 
This done, put a small bit of cheese in each pepper and return them to 
the pan with a good lump of butter. Fry them gently so the butter will 
not scorch. When done pour three well-beaten eggs slightly salted into 
the pan with the peppers and when set take them up by the spoonful — 
a pepper in each — and lay them on the chopped tomatoes. 

Omelets. — It is always better to make several small omelets than one 
large one, if a number of persons are to be served. It is much more 
likely to turn out well. Nearly everyone has her own special recipe for 
this dish; the regulation French omelet calls for three eggs well beaten, 
to which three tablespoonfuls of water are added, and stirred in lightly. 
A level tablespoonful of butter is melted in a perfectly smooth frying 
pan and the omelet turned in; it is shaken gently to prevent sticking, 
and when cooked rolled over with a flexible knife and slid on to a hot 
dish. It is varied by putting in a filling before rolling over; half a cup 
of grated cheese is very nice, or some jam or jelly for a sweet omelet, 
which makes a rich dessert. Some cooks stir 3 little flour into the first 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. Ill 

egg beaten, and separate the eggs, folding in the beaten whites last; 
this makes a very light and puffy omelet. 

Buttermilk Omelet. — Four eggs beaten separately, one cupful of but- 
termilk, one-half teaspoonful of soda, three-quarters cup of finely rolled 
cracker crumbs, a scant teaspoonful of salt, one-eighth of a teaspoonful 
of pepper. Have two tablespoonfuls of butter hot in a frying pan. 
Turn in omelet and fry a delicate brown. Place in oven for 10 minutes 
and when firm fold and serve. 

Fairy Omelet. — Beat yolks and whites of six eggs separately; add five 
tablespoonfuls of milk to the yolks. Heat a skillet and put in a table- 
spoonful of butter; let it melt, pour in the beaten yolks and pile be- 
tween whites on the top; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cover and 
cook three minutes, slip out on hot platter and serve by cutting through 
yolks and whites. 

French Omelet. — Beat thoroughly, first, the yolks and then the whites 
of the eggs; to the yolks add a tablespoonful of boiling water, a pinch 
of salt and a dash of pepper; turn the stiff whites into the yolks and 
fold; that is, stir them in so that the air bubbles shall not be broken. 
Turn carefully into a frying pan, in which has been melted a large 
piece of butter. Set where it may cook very slowly, and when well 
browned on one side set in the oven to brown on the other. Send im- 
mediately to the table. The omelet may be varied by dropping chopped 
meat in it, chopped celery, grated cheese, or, if a sweet omelet is de- 
sired, by spreading jelly over and folding. 

Orange Omelet. — Beat yolks of three eggs; add three tablespoonfuls 
of sugar and the grated rind of one orange; add a pinch of salt to the 
whites of the eggs and beat until stiff; mix the whites lightly with the 
yolks, sprinkling in at the same time three tablespoonfuls of orange 
juice; melt one teaspoonful of butter in a clean, small frying pan till 
the bottom is greased; turn in the egg mixture; cook slowly, turning 
the pan that the bottom may brown evenly; when firm on the bottom 
put pan in a hot oven; fold in half and turn out on a hot platter; 
sprinkle over powdered sugar. 

Pannikins. — Take some little earthen pans, such as are sold for toy 
milk pans, capable of holding one egg only; heat them in the oven, and 
when quite hot take them out, and with a paste brush butter them in- 
side; break an egg carefully into each pan; set them into the oven until 
the white of the egg is hard enough to retain the form of the pan; turn 
them out in a circle on the dish in which they are to be served. On the 
top of each sprinkle a little fresh parsley or grated ham; have ready a 
sauce of bread crumbs beaten up with rich gravy, browned and seasoned; 
place this in the center of the dish, the eggs inclosing it.

Canadian Poached Eggs. — A cupful of milk is brought to scalding 
point in a shallow granite vessel, and into this the eggs are gently dropped, 
then covered. The milk is not allowed to boil, merely kept at the scald- 
ing point. The eggs will be ready in about two minutes, with the yolk 
inside of a beautiful pearly film. Lift them out carefully with a skim- 
mer and set each egg on a slice of buttered, delicately-browned toast. 
Add to the hot milk one tablespoonful of butter and one tablespoonful 
of flour rubbed smooth, season with pepper and celery salt, beat till 
creamy and pour over the poached eggs. 

Poached Eggs in Glasses. — Add a few grains of salt to the white of 
an egg (a level saltspoonful to five eggs) and beat until dry; turn into 
a buttered glass and form a nest on the top for the yolk, which must 
be kept whole. Put the glass on a trivet, or an inverted tin cover, in a 
covered dish of lukewarm water, letting the water come to within half 
an inch of the top of glasses, and let cook until the egg is set and rises 
in the glass. Do not allow the water which is around the glass to boil. 
Serve at once. Prepare as many eggs in glasses as there are persons 
to be served. Dainty and wholesome for invalids. 

Eggs Poached in Tomato Sauce. — Put into the frying pan one table- 
spoonful of butter, one tablespoonful of flour; heat until frothy; stir 
into it 1J4 teacupful of tomato (which has been peeled and chopped 
fine and heated) and then strain into the frying pan a dash of cayenne 
pepper and a heaping saltspoonful of salt; cook until creamy, and drop 
in four eggs, baste often, and when whites are set remove and put each 
egg on a quarter of a slice of buttered toast and pour sauce around 
them. 

St. Pancras Eggs. — Separate the yolks from the whites of five eggs; 
keep each yolk separate; whip the whites to a stiff froth, adding a salt- 
spoonful of salt; butter five small cups, put the whites into them and 
carefully drop the yolk into the center of each; dust with salt and pep- 
per; place the cups in a shallow pan of hot water, put in the oven and 
bake five minutes, or till the whites are set. Serve in the cups. 

Egg Salad. — Boil six eggs perfectly hard, putting them on in cold 
water and cooking 10 minutes after this reaches the boil, that the yolks 
may be dry and mealy. Cut the whites in two, remove carefully and rub 
the yolks to a paste with three tablespoonfuls of minced ham or chicken 
or both, 10 drops of onion juice, a saltspoonful of mustard, a table- 
spoonful of melted butter, salt to taste and half a teaspoonful of paprika. 
Crowd this mixture back into the halved whites, cutting a bit off the bot- 
tom of each cup, that it may stand upright, and letting the newly formed 
yolk rise above the edge of the white as far as the original yolk would 
have done. Arrange these on lettuce leaves and serve with a French 
dressing or with boiled salad dressing. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 113 

Scalloped Eggs. — Boil eight eggs hard; put in cold water for five 
minutes; then shell and cut into slices with very sharp knife; put a 
layer in small buttered baking dish; sprinkle with fine bread crumbs, 
salted, a dash of pepper, small dots of butter; fill up dish in this man- 
ner, having the bread crumbs on top with small pieces of butter; have 
ready one cupful of hot milk, into which a teaspoonful of cornstarch 
dissolved in a tablespoonful of milk has been well stirred, and a pinch 
of salt ; pour milk over eggs and crumbs ; - put in a quick oven for 15 
minutes; serve in baking dish. 

Scrambled Eggs. — Break tlie required number of eggs in a bowl; 
beat until the yolks are broken. Put a lump of butter the size of a 
walnut in a frying pan; as soon as it is melted turn in the eggs, and 
stir until it is set. Serve immediately. A pleasing change is made in 
scrambled eggs by stirring in a little potted meat or finely chopped par- 
sley just before serving, and then sprinkling over the top some hot 
browned bread crumbs. 

Scotch Woodcock. — Make a half-pint of cream sauce, using one and 
one-half tablespoonful of butter, onfe of flour and a cupful of cream. 
Season with one-fourth of a saltspoonful of white pepper, and a half- 
teaspoonful of Worcestershire sauce. Shell and chop fine five hard- 
boiled eggs, add them to the sauce, cook for three minutes and serve 
on well-buttered rounds of crisp toast. 

Welsh Rabbit. — Half a pound of cheese, two eggs, a speck of ca- 
yenne, a tablespoonful of butter, on teaspoonful of mustard, half tea- 
spoonful of salt, half a cupful of cream or rich milk. Break the cheese 
in small pieces, and put all the ingredients in a double boiler, or in a 
pan over hot water. Stir until the cheese melts; then spread on toast 
and serve at once. 

Egg Timbales. — Beat four eggs, add to them one cup of milk, half 
teaspoonful salt, and four dashes of pepper. Pour into buttered custard 
cups, set these in a pan of hot water, and cook in a slow oven until the 
timbales are set in the center. Turn out on a hot dish, and pour over 
them a cream sauce made by placing half a pint of milk in a double 
boiler; rub together a rounding tablespoonful each of butter and flour, 
stir this into the boiling milk until it thickens, add half a teaspoonful of 
salt and four dashes of pepper. 

Egg Toast. — Butter a shallow pudding dish, put in it a layer of toast, 
cut into narrow scrips, then a layer of hard-boiled whites of eggs, cut 
into slices, then another layer of toast. Put over this the yolks of the 
hard-boiled eggs, riced by passing through a vegetable press; then pour 
over all a rich cream sauce highly seasoned, and place in the oven until 
it is well browned. 



CHAPTER X. 

VEGETABLES. 

Asparagus. — The average cook rarely tries any other mode than boil- 
ing. Boil the stalks whole, after careful washing, tying in a bundle to 
keep from breaking; drain, lay upon toast, and serve with cream sauce. 
Another way is to cut in inch lengths, and stew in milk, thickening with 
flour, and seasoning with butter, pepper and salt. 

Asparagus a la Vinaigrette. — Cook as for boiled asparagus. While 
cooking make a hot French dressing by mixing together in a saucepan 
over the fire six tablespoonfuls of salad oil, two of vinegar, two tea- 
spoonfuls of French mustard, half a teaspoonful of sugar, salt and pep- 
per to taste. When the asparagus is tender drain, put in a deep dish 
and pour over it the hot dressing. Cover and set aside to cool, then 
stand in the ice chest for an hour or so before serving. 

Baked Beans with Cream. — Soak and parboil a pint of navy beans 
until half cooked; drain, dash over a quart of cold water, drain again 
and add the last water (boiling) with two heaping teaspoonfuls of salt, 
one-eighth teaspoonful pepper, one large sprig of thyme (minced), two 
tablespoonfuls of beef drippings or the clean, browned trimmings of fat 
from roast beef, and fried steak may be used instead of the drippings; 
when beans are cooked tender turn all into a covered bean pot and 
bake in a very moderate oven five hours. Then pour over the beans a 
cupful of sweet cream and bake an hour longer. 

Baked Beans and Tomato Sauce. — Prepare the beans as for ordinary 
baking, by soaking and parboiling; then put in a crock, with the pork, 
and add the sauce, which should be prepared while the beans are cook- 
ing. Some cooks merely use the juice from a can of tomatoes; we pre- 
fer to use some of the solid part, too. Stew slowly, put through a sieve 
to make it smooth, and flavor with salt, pepper, a small pinch of clove, 
a little mustard, and, if desired, a shred of onion. Do not thicken; pour 
this over the beans, cover and bake. Add a little water from time to 
time if the beans seem to be becoming too dry. A little sugar may be 
added to the sauce if the family taste approves. 

String Beans and Bacon. — Cut one or two slices of tender mild-cured 
bacon in tiny cubes and cook to a delicate brown in the frying pan. 
Add a pint of hot cooked and drained string beans and a few drops of 
onion juice. Shake the frying pan thoroughly. Add salt and pepper as 
needed and turn into a hot dish. Peas may be served in the same way. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 115 

Lyonnaise Beets. — Two cupfuls of boiled beets cut into half-inch 
dice, three tablespoonfuls of vinegar, one tablespoonful of butter, one 
tablespoon of chopped parsley, one-fourth of a teaspoonful of salt, half 
the quantity of pepper. Put all of the ingredients except the beets into 
a double boiler. When well heated add the beets, stir for a few min- 
utes that they may absorb the dressing and serve very hot. 

Baked Summer Cabbage. — Cut into quarters and boil tender in salt 
and water two medium-sized heads of cabbage, drain and chop. Ar- 
range an inch layer in the bottom of a baking dish. Sprinkle with black 
pepper, then crumb in a layer of stale bread. Drop small bits of butter 
over the bread crumbs. Repeat the process until the dish is nearly full, 
bread coming on top. Then pour over the whole one pint of rich milk 
or thin cream, and bake until nicely browned. 

Baked Cabbage With Cheese. — Boil a firm white cabbage for 15 min- 
utes in salted water, then change the water for more that is boiling, and 
boil until tender. Drain and when cool chop fine. Butter a baking 
dish, and lay in the chopped cabbage. Put one tablespoonful of butter 
'"n a frying pan ; when it bubbles stir in one tablespoonful of flour, one 
half -pint of stock, same of boiling water; stir until smooth. Then 
season with saltspoonful salt, half as much pepper, four tablespoonfuls 
grated cheese. Pour over the cabbage, sprinkle cracker crumbs over the 
top, dot with bits of butter and bake in a quick oven 10 minutes. 

Browned Cabbage.— One small cabbage, one tablespoonful of buttter, 
half a cupful of milk, two eggs and bread crumbs. Cut the cabbage, into 
small pieces and remove the hard center. Wash the pieces in cold wa- 
ter; then pour boiling water over them and let stand for 10 minutes. 
Drain off the hot water and put the cabbage in boiling salted water to 
cook until tender. When it is done pour off the water, pressing down 
hard on the cabbage, to be sure that all the water has been drained away. 
Chop as fine as possible, beat up the eggs, add the milk and stir all the 
ingredients and seasoning with the cabbage. Put the whole into a but- 
tered baking dish and bake for one hour in a moderate oven. 

Red Cabbage, German Style. — Slice red cabbage thin, cover with 
cold water, and let soak 20 minutes; then drain. Put one quart in a stew 
pan with two tablespoonfuls of butter, one-half teaspoonful of salt, OBe 
tablespoonful of finely chopped onion and a few gratings each of nut- 
meg and cayenne. Cover, and cook until the cabbage is tender; then 
add two tablespoonfuls of vinegar and one-half tablespoonful of sugar, 
and cook five minutes. 

Carrot Ragout. — Clean and scrape enough new carrots to measure a 
pint; take the same quantity of new potatoes and white turnips, cutting 
them in pieces about the size of the carrots. Cut a half cupful of leeks 
in fine slices. Cook the carrots in boiling water for half an hour and the 



116 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

other vegetables separately for 10 minutes. In a frying pan brown 
slowly together two tablespoonfuls each of butter or dripping and flour; 
add gradually one pint of stock or water and stir until thick and smooth. 
Season with a level tablespooniul of sugar, one teaspoonful of salt and 
one-quarter of a teaspoonful of white pepper, add the vegetables, cover 
and simmer gently for half an hour, and before serving stir into it a 
tablespoonful of parsley. 

Baked Corn.— One quart corn scraped from cob; one and one-third 
cupful cream; one heaping tablespoonful of butter; season with salt 
and pepper. Bake one hour. 

Baked Corn and Tomatoes.— Fill an earthen pudding dish with alter- 
nate layers of corn and tomatoes, each about an inch thick. Season each 
v/ith salt, pepper and butter. When the dish is full sprinkle with grated 
bread crumbs and bits of butter. Cover the dish with a plate and bake 
in a moderately hot oven for 20 minutes. Then remove the cover and 
bake 15 minutes longer; 

Corn Chowder. — Cut the kernels from a dozen ears of green corn. 
Peel and mince two onions and fry them brown in three tablespoonfuls 
of butter in a deep saucepan. Now put in the corn, four broken pilot 
biscuits, add a half dozen parboiled and sliced potatoes. Season with 
pepper, salt and a tablespoonful of minced parsley, and cover with a 
quart of boiling water. Let all cook gently for three-quarters of an hour, 
then stir in slowly a cupful of boiling milk, thickened with a tablespoon- 
ful of flour rubbed into one of butter. Turn at once into a heated tureen. 

Escalloped Corn. — Into a buttered dish put a layer of green corn pulp, 
sprinkling with salt and bits of butter. Over this spread a layer of 
cracker crumbs, seasoned and moistened slightly with milk. Fill the dish 
with alternate layers of corn and cracker crumbs, with crackers for top 
layer and plenty of milk over the whole. Cover and bake one hour. 

Hulled Corn. — New England taste demands a- well-ripened white flint 
corn for hulling, other sections prefer yellow, but it is always flint corn, 
Babbitt's potash is used to remove the hulls, the proportion being one 
full pound to a bushel of corn. Of course, when preparing corn for 
home use, the same proportion would be observed in smaller quantities. 
An iron kettle half filled with water is put on the stove, the potash added 
when the water warms, and the corn put in when it comes to a boil. In 
about an hour the starch will come out of the corn, thickening the lye. 
The corn must be well stirred from the bottom, to avoid burning, and 
the kettle kept back on the stove, so the corn will simmer without boiling 
hard. After the first hour corn must be dipped out and tested in cold 
water, to see if the hulls slip. If left in the potash too long it becomes 
dark and sodden; if too short, it cannot be cooked tender. About V/i to 
tyro boB.rs j§ the usual time, The corn J? tlie.n washg^ in clear water. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 117 

When made in large quantities a clean, new broom, with about six inches 
of the straw cut off, is used to rub off the hulls; a stiff whisk would 
answer the same purpose with small quantities. A quantity of vfater will 
be used during this scrubbing, the hulls being poured off with the water. 
Put the corn on to boil in clear water; when it reaches the boiling point 
draw it back, so that it may simmer. It should not be stirred, as this 
makes it mushy. It requires long, slow simmering; when sufficiently 
cooked it may be salted to taste, and drained in a colander. When 
served it is either eaten with milk, or warmed up with butter in a frying 
pan, and served like a vegetable. In the Summer hulled corn would 
ferment very quickly, so its manufacture takes place only after hard freez- 
ing has started in the Fall. 

Hulled corn may also be prepared as follows : Wash two quarts of 
shelled corn to remove loose bits; then place in a large iron kettle with 
two heaping tablespoons of saleratus, cover with cold water, let come 
to a, boil slowly and cook about an hour. Remove the kettle from fire, 
drain off the water, then pour the corn, from which the hulls will already 
be loosened, into a large pan of water. Rub the corn between the hands 
to loosen the hulls ; after taking off all those partly loosened put it on 
again in warm water, let boil about half an hour, then try to remove 
the rest of the hulls by rubbing as before. After all hulls are removed, 
wash the corn in at least half a dozen clear waters, then put on once 
more in warm water, and when it boils drain and add fresh water. Let 
the corn cook in this last water until tender, salting to taste. If the 
hulls do not come off readily let the corn boil an hour longer, adding a 
teaspoon more saleratus. 

Corn Pudding. — Two coffeecupfuls of green corn pulp, one cupful of 
new milk, three eggs, two heaping tablespoonfuls of butter. Pour one 
pint of the milk over the corn and set on the fire until scalding hot. Beat 
the yolks of the eggs and add the pint of cold milk and half a cuplul of 
sugar. Put the butter in the corn over the fire, and then add the milk 
and yolks of eggs and a little salt. Put in a buttered pudding dish and 
bake slowly. Make a meringue of the whites of the eggs and powdered 
sugar and spread over the top when pudding is done, browning slightly. 

Succotash. — Cook one pint of corn pulp in as little water as you can 
without scorching. Put the. cobs in a quart of water and boil hard for 
20 minutes ; remove cobs and in this water boil one pint of shelled beans 
until tender; drain and mix with the corn. Add butter the size of a 
walnut, pepper, salt and half a cupful of thick cream, more if liked. 
Serve hot. 

Baked Egg Plant. — Select one that is firm and fresh, peel it and cut 
it into quarters. Let it lie half an hour in salted water. Put it into boil- 
ing water with a teaspoonful of salt, Cook until it can be easily pierce4

with a fork. While the plant is ccokiiig cut one medium-sized onion 
into small pieces and coyer it with salt water. In 10 minutes pour off the 
n-ater and put the chopped cnton into a hot pan, with a tablespoonfnl of 
batter. Cook until it is thorou^y tender and brown. Drain the egg 
plant in a colander, put into a bowl, stir with a silver fork until it is 
broken up, but not mashed. ISIix with it an equal qnantity of rolled 
bread crumbs, add the browned onion and one well-beaten egg. Season 
with a dash of salt, two dashes of pepper, and add a dessertspoonful of 
butter. Put the mixture into a weU-buttered earthen dish, bake just 
long enough to be nicely browned. Serve hot in the dish in which it is 
baked. 

Dutch Ht:t;pot. — ^Boil six carrots with six onions (medimn size) one 
hour, or tmtfl tender. In another kettle boil six medium-sized potatoes 
until done. Drain aU the water from both, ptrt; them together, mash them 
well, add one teaspoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonfol of sugar, one- 
quarter teaspoonful of pepper, one-half cupful of butter and one-half 
cupful of milk or cream. Beat well and serve hot 

Macaroni and Qieese. — ^The macaroni is first put into boiling salted 
water and cooked tender — a half hour or less — then it is drained, and 
rinsed with cold water, and cut in convenient pieces. A buttered pudding 
dish is then filled with alternate layers of the macaroni and chopped or 
grated cheese, perhaps a cupful of the cheese to a quart of the cooked 
macarcnL Seascn with salt and pepper, fill the dish with miUc, and cover 
with bread or cracker criimbs mixed with a little mdted butter and bake 
in a moderate oven for nearly an hour, or till the macaroni absorbs most 
of the ndlk. 

llacaroni, Italian Stjle. — ^Four tablespoonfuls of butter, one-half 
pound of macaroni, an onion, parsley, herbs, tomato catsup and spice. 
Put in a pan one tab'espoonful each of finely-chopped onion, parsley and 
rtsemarj-; fry in bubbling butter until well browned; add four table- 
spoonf'jls of tomato catsup, some mixed spice, four tablespoonfuls of 
butter and one quart of boiling water; put in macaroni broken into 
medium-sLzed pieces ; freouently shake the pan and stew over a slow fire 
untU the n:acar:ni is tender. Arrange on a hot dish, pouring the sauce 
ever. Sprinkle thickly with grated cheese. 

Okra, Creole Style. — ^^Va3h, trim and cut into slices a quart of young, 
tender okra; place in a granite saucepan two teaspoonftds of butter, a 
medium-sized onion, a medium-sized green pepper, both minced fine; stir 
ever the £re until a golden brown, then add three large tomatoes peeled 
and c-.;t into pieces, three tablespoonfuls of Spanish or some hot pepper 
sauce and salt to taste, and the okra. Cover the saucepan and simmer 
gentiy for half an h^ur. Turn out on a hot dish and sprinkle over with 
a teaspoonful of minced parsley and serve. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. U9 

Baked Onions.— Peel and cut in thick slices large white onions. Par- 
boil in plenty of salted water, drain well, arrange in a buttered baking 
dish, dot with bits of butter and bake until soft and a pale yellow. 
Sprinkle with salt and pepper and cover with a half-inch layer of grated 
crumbs thickly dredged with grated cheese. Return to the oven long 
enough to melt the cheese. 

Escalloped Onions. — Slice some onions and cook in salted water until 
done, drain and put layers of onion and cracker crumbs seasoned with 
salt, pepper and butter in pudding dish; moisten with milk. Bake 20 to 
30 minutes. 

Baked Split Peas.— Rub a large baking dish with onion. Turn into 
this a pint of split peas soaked until soft. Chop a large onion very fine 
and spread over the top of the peas with pepper and salt. If you have 
left over gravy or stock pour it over the mixture. If not, cover with 
water, spreading over all bacon cut into the thinnest possible slices. Bake 
in the oven for two hours and add a little boiling water if the peas get 
too dry. 

French Fried Potatoes. — Old potatoes are better for this, or the little 
yellowish potatoes that German cooks use for potato salad. These con- 
tain more gluten. Peel very thin and cut in long thin strips lengthwise. 
Let them stand in cold salted water for two or three hours. Drain and 
wipe dry ; put into a wire basket and fry in very hot, deep fat until brown. 
Take out and lay on a piece of manila paper to absord the fat; dust with 
salt and serve. Another way to fry potatoes is to put a little olive oil in 
a deep frying pan; when very hot add sliced cold boiled potatoes. Cover, 
and cook until a golden brown, turning once. Drain, put in a hot vege- 
table dish and sprinkle with salt, pepper and lemon juice. Still another 
way, that the French chef delights in, is to chop cold boiled potatoes, then 
season lightly with salt, pepper and onion juice. Put a couple of table- 
spoonfuls of olive oil or good drippings in the frying pan, turn in the 
potatoes, press into a solid cake and cook slowly until crusty and brown 
on the under side. Turn on to a hot platter, with the brown side upper- 
most 

Potatoes au Gratin. — Peel and cut into dice half a dozen potatoes, 
crisp in cold water, then drain, and boil until tender. Drain the water 
off, put the potatoes in a baker, season with pepper and salt, stir a table- 
spoonful of butter through the pieces, pour over them half a cup of milk, 
cover the top with grated cheese, bake quickly and serve hot. 

Potato Chowder. — Wash and pare four large potatoes. Cut them 
into small dice. Chop fine one-quarter of a pound of ham and one good- 
sized onion. Slowly fry the ham and onion together until a light brown, 
then in a saucepan put alternate layers of the ham and diced potato, 
seasoning well with salt and pepper. Add one tablespoonful of finely- 



120 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

chopped parsley and one pint of boiling water, cover and simmer slowly 
until the potatoes are tender, which will take about twenty minutes. In 
a second saucepan thicken two cupfuls of milk with one tablespoonful 
of butter, and one tablespoonful of flour, simmer for a moment, add it 
to the chowder and let cook for two minutes longer. 

Potato Dumplings. — Boil six large potatoes and mash, seasoning with 
one-half teaspoonful salt. Place on a board. Add to this one egg and 
one-half cupful flour; knead into a dough. Roll out into strips, one-half 
inch thick, and cut into inch lengths. Sprinkle the pieces with flour, so 
that they are quite dry. Place enough of the dumplings in a saucepan 
of boiling water to allow them freedom to swim, and allow them to boil 
about eight minutes. E.emove the dumplings from the water, with a 
perforated spoon, to a hot frying pan, in which one cupful bread crumbs 
have been browned in about two tablespoonfuls butter. All of the dump- 
lings can be placed in the pan at the same time. They should be stirred 
from time to time, until nicely browned, keeping a small fire under the 
pan. Serve hot. 

German Sour Potatoes. — Boil four good-sized potatoes. When done 
and cold, skin and cut into cubes. Place these in a bowl and add salt 
and pepper to taste. Now mix in another bowl half a pint of sweet oil 
and four tablespoonfuls of sweet cider vinegar, one good-sized onion, 
grated fine and sprigs of parsley finely chopped. Mix these together well 
and pour over the potatoes. Now place the empty bowl on top of the 
full one and shake up and down until well mixed. Garnish the dish with 
lemon slices, cut in halves. 

Hashed Brown Potatoes.— Cut or chop finely a quart of cold baked 
or boiled potatoes and put them down in a frying pan in which has been 
dissolved a tablespoonful of butter and an equal quantity of tried-out suet 
or beef dripping. Let the potatoes simmer in this and season with pepper 
and salt; have the pan covered. When the potatoes seem rich and moist 
throughout and browned underneath add a sprinkling of finely-minced 
parsley and with a large, flexible knife loosen the potatoes from the bot- 
tom of the pan, turning the sides over toward the middle as in making 
an omelet, and slip them carefully on to the serving dish. For a pint of 
potatoes use half the quantity of butter and drippings. 

Lyonnaise Potatoes.— Put V/^ tablespoonful of butter in a frying pan; 
when melted add a scant tablespoonful of chopped onion; let it slightly 
color, then add two cupfuls of cold boiled potatoes cut into dice. Stir 
until the potato has absorbed all the butter and become slightly browned; 
then sprinkle with salt, pepper and a tablespoonful of chopped parsley! 
Mix well and serve very hot. 

Scalloped Potatoes.— Peel and slice very thin one medium-sized potato 
for each person to be served, and allow the slices to remain in cold water

till crisp. Prepare as you would scalloped oysters with cracker crumbs 
and salt and pepper sprinkled over each layer, and small dots of butter. 
Cover the top of the pan with crumbs and carefully pour on sweet milk 
almost to cover without disturbing the cracker crumbs. Bake two hours 
and a half in a steady oven, removing cover from pan during last half 
hour. It is better to use your thickest, heaviest kettle cover or earthen- 
ware pie pan for the first hour in the oven. 

Spaghetti with Brown Sauce. — Put a half pound of spaghetti into 
slightly-salted boiling water. Boil half an hour, drain and pour into a 
buttered granite pan. Pour over it the following brown sauce : Heat 
three tablespoonfuls butter, stir into this two tablespoonfuls flour, stir 
till smooth. Draw to a cooler place' on the stove and add gradually one 
cupful cold water, stirring constantly. Let it boil up, add one scant tea- 
spoonful salt, one-fourth teaspoonful pepper, one teaspoonful of catsup, 
simmer two or three minutes, pour over spaghetti, set it into the oven 
and let it bake 10 or 15 minutes. 

Squash Puff. — Press dry cooked squash through a sieve; to a half pint 
add two tablespoons of melted butter, quarter of a cup of milk, seasoning 
of salt and pepper, and two beaten egg yolks. Mix thoroughly, fold in 
two beaten egg whites, and turn into a buttered mold, set in a pan of 
hot water and bake in the oven until the center is firm. Serve turned 
from the mold and accompanied by a rich cream sauce made from one 
tablespoon each of flour and butter with a cup of scalded cream or rich 
milk and seasoning of salt, pepper, celery salt and mace. This can be 
baked in individual molds if desired. 

Scalloped Squash. — Two cupfuls of boiled squash run through a 
colander, and then let cool; two eggs, a tablespoonful of melted butter, 
half a cup of milk ; pepper and salt ; half a cupful of bread crumbs. Beat 
eggs, butter and milk and squash light; season; pour into a buttered bake 
dish, sift crumbs over it and bake, covered, half an hour; then brown 
lightly. 

Stewed Summer Squash. — Wash, pare, cut into pieces after removing 
the seeds, cook in a small quantity of water until tender; drain and press 
dry, salt slightly and serve on golden-browned toast with a cream dress- 
ing made as follows : Into half a pint of rich milk stir one teaspoonful 
of cornstarch, let boil until slightly thickened, then pour it over the toast 
and squash. 

Sweet Potato, Southern Style.— Peel and boil until they are thoroughly 
but not too well cooked. Then they should be cut into four pieces length- 
wise and placed in a tin baking pan. Butter and sugar should be placed 
over the potatoes abundantly before they are put in the oven to bake 
slowly. After a while, the butter and sugar mingling with the juice of 
the potatoes, forms a delicate crust that should be cooked until it has 



123 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

almost reached the point at which it is candy. Under this crust is a 
thick, rich syrup of the sap of the potatoes, sugar and butter. 

Stuffed Sweet Potatoes.— Select large, fine potatoes of uniform size. 
Bake them soft, taking care that they do not burn. With a sharp knife 
cut a slit lengthwise in each and scrape out the inside, breaking the skin 
as little as possible. Put the pulp into a bowl; work into it a tablespoon- 
ful of butter, enough hot milk to make a soft paste; salt and pepper to 
taste, and a teaspoonful of lemon juice. Beat light, and fill the emptied 
skins with the mixture. Bring the cut edges neatly together, and set the 
potatoes back in the oven to reheat. Serve in a deep dish lined with a 
heated napkin. 

Baked Tomatoes, Italian Style.— Pour two tablespoonfuls of olive oil 
into a baking dish. Add four tablespoonfuls of grated bread crumbs 
that have already been mixed with parsley and other herbs, all of which 
must have been chopped very fine. Season with pepper and salt. Upon 
this bed of oil and crumbs lay a dozen tomatoes that have been cut in 
halves. Cover them with four more tablespoonfuls of bread crumbs that 
have previously been seasoned in the same way. Pour over all two more 
tablespoonfuls of oil and send the dish to a hot oven, where the tomatoes 
must bake for about one hour. 

Panned Tomatoes. — These are excellent served with roast meats. Put 
in a pan with two ounces of butter six firm tomatoes that have been cut 
in halves. Cook slowly on the top of the range for 10 minutes, then 
brown quickly in the oven. Remove the tomatoes to a hot platter, and 
make a sauce by adding to the browned butter two tablespoonfuls of 
flour, and after it is rubbed smooth one pint of milk. Stir until boiling. 
Season well with salt and pepper and pour over the tomatoes. Garnish 
with parsley and points of toast. 

Scallop of Tomatoes and Potatoes.- — Season a pint of peeled and 
chopped tomatoes with salt, pepper and onion juice to suit the taste, and 
add enough potatoes to make a cupful when chopped fine. Butter a baking 
dish and sprinkle with bread crumbs and put in half of the tomatoes; 
then a layer of soft crackers, buttered and broken in coarse bits. Cover 
the crackers with two heaping tablespoonfuls of grated American cheese. 
Then add the remainder of the tomatoes, more cracker crumbs and bits 
of butter and place in a hot oven. Bake 20 minutes. Serve at once. 



CHAPTER XI. 

CANNING AND PRESERVING. 

This chapter does not aim to cover the entire ground, but to give 
briefly the experience of other housewives, which may include some in- 
formation not generally found in print. There are still many housewives 
who laboriously can fruit by cooking it in a kettle, and then lifting it 
into the jars; we make preserves in that way, but our canned fruit 
is packed into jars, covered with hot syrup, and then cooked by standing 
the jars in water in a wash boiler. Instead of putting odd pieces of board 
in the bottom of the boiler to rest the jars on, have a board made to fit, 
with three cleats across it underneath and a number of auger holes bored 
in it so that the water passes through. We usually put enough water to 
come half w^ay up the jars, but some housekeepers elevate the jars above 
the water and cover the boiler closely, thus cooking the fruit in the steam. 
Of course there are cooking kettles made for this purpose which are 
more convenient than a wash boiler. 

Fruit is canned without sugar after the following method : Fill the 
jars with fruit; then pour in as much water as they will hold; adjust the 
rubbers ; lay the lids carefully on top without fastening them down ; stand 
the jars in a wash boiler, the bottom of which has been protected with a 
rack; surround them with cold water; put the lid on the boiler; bring to 
boiling point and boil strawberries, blackberries, raspberries and curranti 
for twenty minutes; cherries, for three-quarters of an hour; pineapples, 
for half an hour; peaches and pears, for half an hour. Strawberries and 
raspberries are better without water. Fill the jars with fruit, bring them 
to boiling point, and when the fruit shrinks or settles you may fill two 
jars from a third; put them back in the boiler; cook for five or 10 
minutes longer and then fasten on the lids. Seal the jars. Lift the jars 
one at a time and screw on the lids without lifting them. Wipe the jars, 
put them into a cool place out of the draught. Next morning give each 
lid a turn and store in a cool dark place. 

Canned fruit may also be cooked in the oven. Pack the prepared 
fruit in the jars, fill up with hot syrup, and lay the cover on top of the 
jar without fastening. Place in the oven, setting in a dripping-pan holding 
about two inches of water, or on a strip of asbestos. The oven should be 
moderately hot. Cook the fruit 10 or 15 minutes, dependent again upon 
the fruit, then lift from the oven, one can at a time, fill to overflowing 
with the scalding syrup, running the blade of a silver knife around the 
edge of the can to allow for the escape of all air-bubbles, then wipe and 



124 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

screw as tightly as possible. Set the jars on a thickly folded newspaper, 
out of a draft, until the fruit has cooled, then tighten again. 

The following method is highly recommended for small fruits: Look 
over the fruit carefully, using only that which is perfect. Place in glass 
jars, that are also perfect. Shake down the fruit, but do not press down. 
Have ready enough hot syrup to cover the fruit. Fill the can full of the 
syrup, including the fruit already in. Screw on the cover tightly, and 
drop into a pail of boiling water. Be sure that the water is boiling, and 
that it covers the can well. Remove the pail to the table or some other 
convenient place; when the water is cool, take out the can, screw down 
the cover, if it is not tight, label, wrap in brown paper, and put away in 
the fruit cupboard. 

Some firm fruits, and also rhubarb, may be canned without cooking, 
being packed into the bottle, which is then filled with cold water. The 
jar is filled to overflowing, and any air bubbles removed by running the 
blade of a silver knife down the side; it is then sealed tightly and stored 
in a cool dark place. 

Try to avoid beet sugar when making jelly. We have never succeeded 
in hardening a fruit jelly made with beet sugar, and many exasperating 
cases of jelly that won't "jell" are due to this cause. Marian Harland 
says that many years ago she v/as advised to use one-fifth more beet sugar 
than a recipe called for when cane sugar was used. 

Almack's Preserves. — This is a foreign recipe. Peel and stone one 
quart of large ripe plums ; peel and slice one dozen apples and one dozen 
pears. Arrange in an earthen jar in alternate layers, adding one pound 
of sugar to each pound of fruit. Set on back of range on an asbestos 
mat and simmer slowly until a little when cooled on ice shows it to be 
of such a firm consistency that it can be cut with a knife, for it is to be 
served cut in slices. When sufficiently cooked put away in a shallow jar 
from which it will be easy to cut it out. Seal like jelly, with paraffin 
before covering. 

Preserved Ginger. — Clean and wash some fine green ginger roots, let 
them lie several hours in cold water, drain and place the roots in |a 
kettle of boiling water, cook 20 minutes ; drain and rinse off with oold 
water; return the ginger to the kettle, cover with fresh boiling water and 
cook until the ginger is soft; drain and put in cold water. Next day 
drain the roots in a sieve and weigh them; allow for each pound one 
pound of sugar and one-half pint of water; boil sugar and water five 
minutes, add the ginger, boil a few minutes, remove and pour the ginger 
in a bowl. Twelve hours later drain off the syrup, boil it three minutes 
and pour it over the ginger ; repeat this twice more. Then drain off all 
the syrup, place over the fire, boil to a soft ball, add the ginger, cook two 
minutes and fill into jars. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 125 

Canned Baked Apples. — Select good tart cooking apples; wash, remove 
the blossom end, but do not peel. Arrange in a baking pan with hot 
water to half fill the pan. Sprinkle with sugar, bits of sweet butter, and 
a dash of any spice if desired, and bake until tender. Can while hot, using 
the juice in which they were baked. Stand the jar in hot water 30 
minutes before wanted for use, and you will have perfect baked apples 
for breakfast. Pears canned the same way are fine, or pears with thinly 
sliced quince scattered among them. 

Canned Porter Apples. — Wipe, quarter, core and peel the apples, then 
weigh them. Make a syrup by boiling for 10 minutes one-third the weight 
of the apples in granulated sugar with water, the proportion being 2^ 
cupfuls of water to one pound of sugar. Cook the apples slowly in the 
syrup until soft; do not crowd them. Skim out the apples carefully into 
jars, cover with the boiling syrup, and seal. 

Apple Ginger. — Tie a little -ginger root in a bag. A quarter of a pound 
will do for eight pounds of apples. Put the bag of ginger into three 
pints of cold, clear water. When the water is highly flavored add about 
three-quarters of a pound of sugar to every pound of apples. The three 
pints of water will be sufficient for six pounds of sugar. Add the juice 
of two lemons, laying aside the yellow peel cut in shreds. Clarify the 
syrup by allowing it to cool after it has cooked five minutes and mixing 
the white of two eggs and the shells in the cooled syrup. Return the 
syrup to the fire, let it boil up once, and then draw to the back of the 
stove. A scum will cover it. Strain into a clean saucepan, add the 
yellow peel of the lemons and put in quarters of apples. As soon as 
cooked, lift them out and put in more. Place the apples into jars and 
pour the syrup over them. 

Apple Orange Marmalade. — Core and slice 20 large tart apples. Allow 
for every quart one pint of water. Add the thin peel of one orange, cover 
and boil until tender. Place a sieve over a bowl, pour in the apples and 
let drain without disturbing. Allow for each pint one pound of sugar. 
Peel four large oranges, remove white part and seeds and set aside. Boil 
apple juice till very thick, add orange cut into small pieces and cook until 
a drop retains its shape on a plate. Put in glass jars and cover like 
jelly. The apple pulp may be used in pies. 

Preserved Apples.— Pare and core fine, ripe pippins, and cut them into 
quarters. Weight and to each pound allow one pound of granulated sugar 
and a half pint of boiling water, the grated rind of one and the juice of 
two lemons. Boil the sugar and water until clear (about three minutes), 
skimming the scum from the .-iurface, add the juice and rind of the lemons, 
then the apples, and simmer gently until they are clear and tender, but 
not broken, then stand aside to cool. When cold, put them into jars, cover 



136 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

closely and stand in a cool, dark place for one week. At the end of that 
time tum them carefully into the kettle, bring them to boiling point, and 
simmer for five minutes, then return them to the jars, cover closely v^ith 
tissue paper brushed over with the white of an egg, and put in a dark, 
cool place to keep. Apples are more difficult to keep than any other fruit. 

Blackberry cheese is an old-fashioned but excellent recipe. Three pounds 
apples, peeled and cored; three pounds blackberries. To each pound pulp 
allow three-quarters pound sugar. Peel, core and slice the apples, put 
them in a jar with the blackberries, which must be picked over, and let 
them remain in the oven for three-quarters of an hour, or till the fruit 
is quite soft; pulp through a sieve, and to every pound of pulp allow 
three-quarters of a pound of sugar; boil the pulp for another hour; put 
into jars very hot, and when cold cover in the usual way. It should be 
firm. enough to slice when turned out. 

Barberry Jam. — Pick three pounds of barberries from the stalk, put 
them in a jar or farina boiler, with three pounds of sugar. Stand the jar 
in a saucepan of boiling water, and simmer gently until the sugar is 
dissolved and berries soft, then stand aside all night. In the morning 
put them in a porcelain-lined kettle, and simmer slowly for 35 minutes, 
stirring continually. Turn into glasses and seal when cool, like jelly. 

Barberry Preserves. — This is a very old-fashioned recipe. Four quarts 
of barberries picked from the stems, washed and drained. Heat one large 
quart of molasses and one quart of white sugar together until the sugar 
is dissolved. Skim, and. then add the barberries. Cook until they begin 
to pop and shrivel, which will be in about 10 minutes. Skim them into a 
stone jar, then boil the syrup slowly until it will cover the berries. 

Bar le Due Preserves. — Take selected red (or white) currants of large 
size, one by one, carefully make an incision in the skin, one-fourth an 
inch in size, with tiny embroidery scissors. Through this slit, with a 
sharp needle, remove the seeds, separately, preserving the shape of the 
fruit. Take the weight of the currants in strained honey and, when hot, 
add the currants. Let simmer a minute or two, then seal as jelly. The 
currants retain their shape, are of a beautiful color and melt in the 
mouth. Should the currants liquefy the honey too much, carefully skim 
them out, reduce the syrup at a gentle simmer to desired consistency and 
store as before after adding the fruit. 

Black Currants. — Gather the currants on a dry day; to every pound 
allow half a pint red currant juice and a pound and a half of finely 
pounded loaf sugar. Clip off the heads and stalks; put the juice, currants 
and sugar in a preserving pan; shake it frequently till it boils; carefully 
remove the fruit from the sides of the pan, and take off the scum as it 
rises; let it boil for 10 or 15 minutes. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 127 

Blueberry Mixtures. — A combination of blueberries and gooseberries, 
one portion of gooseberries to three of the blueberries, canned in the 
ordinary fashion, makes an excellent Winter sauce or filling for pies. So 
does a combination of blueberries and rhubarb, one cupful of rhubarb 
and one cupful of sugar to a quart of blueberries. 

Cherry Conserve. — Five quarts cherries (sour), one pound raisins 
(seeded and cut) ; two oranges (pulp cut in pieces, also yellow of skin) ; 
one pound English walnuts (chopped) ; 25-^ pounds sugar. Cook until 
thick and put in jelly tumblers. Cherries must be boiled about 20 minutes 
before putting in sugar, etc. 

Cherry Conserve No. 2. — Three pounds sour cherries; two pounds 
raisins; four pounds granulated sugar; four large oranges. Seed and 
steam the raisins for half an hour. Grate some of the orange peel in the 
cherries. Do not use the orange skin. Cut the pulp into small pieces. 
Mix all the ingredients together, boil for 20 minutes, put in glasses. 

Cherry Preserve, Sun-cooked. — Pit the cherries, which must be perfect 
ripe fruit, weigh, and put in a preserving kettle, allowing three-quarters of 
a pound of sugar to each pound of fruit. Do not add any water; the 
juice and sugar make the syrup. Bring to a boil, and boil for 20 minutes, 
stirring to avoid burning and skimming to keep clear. Skim out the 
fruit, putting on shallow platters, pour the syrup over, and cover with 
clean panes of glass. Put the platters out in thje sun, and keep outdoors 
three days, bringing in at night. Then put in jars, like any other pre- 
serve. The sun cooks the syrup to a honey-like consistence, and the flavor 
is delicious. Strawberries cooked the same way have all the rich frag- 
rance of the fresh fruit. 

Citron Preserves. — Pare and core the citron, cut into strips and notch 
the edges, or cut into fancy shapes. Allow a pound of sugar to a pound 
of fruit, and to six pounds of the fruit allow four lemons and a quarter 
of a pound of ginger root. Tie the ginger root in a cloth and boil it in a 
quart and a half of water until the flavor is extracted ; then remove it and 
add to the water the sugar and the juice of the lemons. Stir until the 
sugv is dissolved and the syrup is clear, remove any scum that may form, 
then add the citron and cook until it is clear, but not soft enough to fall 
apart; can and seal while hot. 

Citron Preserves No. 2.— Cut the citron in strips half an inch wide, 
pare off the rind as thin as possible and cut up the fruit in small squares. 
Put in a vessel and cover the fruit with water in which has been diis- 
solved an ounce of alum to the gallon of water. Soak 24 hours, or until 
the citron is clarified. Take out of alum water and soak in clear water 
until the alum is all out, which will probably bfe in 12 hours. Weigh and 
allow to each pound of fruit a pound of sugar. Put the fruit in a pre- 
serving kettle with only a little sugar, adding sugar several times until 



128 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

the weighed amount has been used. Season with any flavoring preferred. 
Cook rapidly until done, put in glass cans and seal. 

Citron Preserves No. 3. — Pare a large citron, cut into thin slices, and 
then into strips or squares, removing all seeds. Weigh equal quantities of 
fruit and sugar, mix together, and stand over night in a large bowl; the 
sugar draws out juice, forming a syrup. In the morning put in a pre- 
serving kettle, and boil slowly for two to three hours, skimming carefully, 
until the syrup is like honey. About 15 minutes before taking from the 
stove add, for each quart of preserves, one lemon cut in very thin slices, 
and one small piece of green ginger root. Some housekeepers add a few 
whole cloves, but we do not care for this. Another method puts the 
sliced fruit to soak in brine for a few hours, then in clear water to freshen 
it, this process hardening the fruit, but we have never used this process, 
and are quite satisfied with the first recipe given. 

Dried Citron. — To prepare citron for cakes and pies cut the fruit in 
four parts, pare and remove the seeds ; then take a couple of quarts of 
clear water, dissolve a piece of alum the size of a hickorynut in the 
water, put in the preserving kettle as much citron as the water will cover 
and boil until tender enough to pierce with a straw ; then boil in sugar ; 
a pint bowl of sugar to the same measure of fruit. Boil one-half hour. 
Spread it on pie plates and set it in a cool oven or heater and let it dry 
perfectly. 

Preserved Crab Apples.^The apples should be very ripe. Wash them 
well in cold water; put them into a porcelain-lined kettle and just cover 
with boiling water. Let them cook very gently until you can remove the 
skins easily. Drain them,, peel and carefully remove the cores, but do not 
break the apples or remove the stems. Weigh them, allowing one and 
one-quarter pound of sugar to a pound of fruit; allow a cupful of water 
to this quantity of sugar. Put water and sugar over the fire and bring to 
boiling point. Skim until clear, then put in the apples and cook very 
gently until they are tender and transparent. Skim while cooking. When 
they are done put them into small, large-mouthed jars, and when cool 
seal same as jelly. 

Currants, Canning.— Wash the currants, being careful not to break 
them; remove stems, and pack currants into quart cans, shaking them 
down well. To each can add one cup hot sugar, place the jars on a 
wooden frame in the boiler, place the covers loosely on the cans, and put 
enough of cold water in the boiler, so when it begins to boil it will not 
boil into the cans. After the water has boiled for half an hour, the cans 
should be lifted out, the covers screwed on tight and put in a cool, dark 
place until wanted for the table. For those that like mixed fruits, a layer 
of strawberries or raspberries and then a layer of curranjts may be packed 
in the cans. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 129 

Currant Conserve. — P'ive pounds currants; four pounds sugar; one 
pound seeded raisins; four oranges. Grate rind and squeeze out juice of 
oranges. Boil all together half hour. Put in jelly glasses. 

Currant Sauce. — Five pounds of currants, heat in preserving kettle, put 
in a muslin bag and squeeze out all juice. Add five pounds granulated 
sugar, one pound raisins, seeded and chopped fine, two oranges, chopped 
fine. Boil till like jelly. The sender of this recipe does up currants with- 
out cooking. Occasionally she says a can spoils, but on the whole she has 
good luck, every can keeping perfectly some years. The currants are 
looked over carefully, washed and then mashed thoroughly, a glass bottle 
being good for this purpose. She then adds sugar, pound for pound. The 
fruit is sealed in cans, using new rubbers each time. Pineapples are also 
put up in somewhat the same way. Mrs. C.'s way is to chop the fruit 
fine, add sugar pound for pound. The fruit thus prepared is left in a 
gallon crock for two days, its contents being stirred frequently with a 
silver spoon. At the end of the second day the fruit is put in air- 
tight cans. 

Cranberry and Apple Jam. — Take two pounds of cranberries and two 
pounds of apples after they are peeled, cored and chopped. Put them in 
a preserving pan with 3J2 pounds of sugar. When it comes to the boil 
keep the preserve boiling for half an hour, then try a little on a cold 
saucer, and if on cooling it sets well it will be sufficiently done. Tie down 
in small jars. This makes a delicious preserve, the cranberries imparting 
a fine flavor and giving in addition a brilliant color. 

Damson Chee.se.-r-Boil the fruit, with only enough water to prevent 
burning, until tender; rub through a hair sieve until like a paste, add six 
ounces of sugar to each pound of fruit, stir off the fire until the sugar is 
dissolved, then add four chopped kernels from the fruit to each quart, and 
put back to boil. It is wise to put an asbestos mat under the preserving 
kettle, as the fruit will catch and burn very easily. Boil, stirring con- 
tinually, until the preserve will leave the pan quite dry and adhere in a 
mass to the spoon. Press into jelly glasses, and when cold cover with 
paraffin before sealing. When served, the damson cheese is turned out 
of the glass, and cut in thin slices. 

Elderberries.— These may be combined with gooseberries, crab apples 
and green grapes, equal parts of either, making a piquant table sauce, 
while pies made from them might please the individual who does not 
care for the flavor of the single fruit. For Winter use elderberries may 
be preserved in either of the above combinations and treated as other fruit, 
or canned plain without sugar for use in pies only. When making pies 
from the plain canned fruit it is wise to cook the berries with the same 
proportion of sugar, flour, etc., as given for fresh berries, filling the pie 
paste when cold. This insures a jelly-like consistency of the finished 



]30 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

product without those unpalatable doughy lumps too often seen. Again 
they may be spiced and used as a table sauce or in pies, using the same 
proportion. 

Pickled Elderberries for Pies. — Seven pounds elderberries, stemmed; 
four pounds sugar, one pint vinegar, two tablespoonfuls cinnamon, one 
tablespoon cloves. Boil until the juice is father thick. They will keep 
in an open jar. 

Preserved Elderberries. — Seven pounds of elderberries, three pounds of 
granulated sugar, three lemons sliced thin ; put the elderberries alone in a 
stone jar in warm salt and water over night. Next morning drain them 
in a colander, make syrup of the sugar and lemons and one pint of water, 
then put elderberries in the syrup and cook. When they begin to boil 
hard time them 20 minutes, then pour in a jar or can ready for use. 

Preserved Elderberries No. 2. — Shell berries. To an eight-quart panful 
use a heaping tablespoon of salt, pour on hot water and let stand half 
an hour ; drain well. To seven pounds of berries thus prepared, use three 
pounds of sugar and one pint of vinegar; boil well. If one wish to keep 
i'l jars without sealing they should be boiled down thoroughly. For pies 
add a little sugar and flour enough slightly to thicken the juice. 

Spiced Elderberries. — Nine pounds cleaned elderberries, three pounds 
brown sugar, one pint vinegar and one ounce each of cloves, cinnamon 
and allspice. Put sugar and vinegar in a two-gallon granite kettle over 
a slow fire and let come to a boil. Add berries and let simmer two and a 
half hours. Tie spices in little muslin bags and add when nearly done. 
Seal in air-tight cans. 

Preserved Fi.gs. — Take fresh, ripe figs, cut off half the stem of each 
and let soak all night in very weak brine, using two tablespoonfuls of 
salt to each quart of water. In the morning drain and cover with fresh 
water. Make a thick syrup, allowing three-quarters of a pound of sugar 
to each pound of fruit, and one-half cupful of water to each pound of 
sugar. Simmer for a few minutes until the syrup is clear, then drain 
and lay in it the freshened figs and simmer slowly until they look clear. 
Into each jar drop a half-ineh piece of green ginger and the kernels of 
half a dozen peach stones, fill with fruit and syrup and seal. They should 
not be used for at least three months. 

Garfield Butter. — Use two-thirds plums and one-third peaches. Stone 
the plums and pare and stone the peaches.. Mash and heat slowly to boil- 
ing, boil until soft, then rub through a sieve. Measure the pulp thus 
obtained and to one measure of fruit add three-quarters of a measure 
of sugar. Boil until thick, stirring continually, then put into jars and seal. 

Canned Grapes. — After picking ripe grapes from the stem, wash them. 
Remove the skins, keeping them and the pulps separate. Cook the pulps 
until the seeds begin to separate. Run through a colander or coarse sieve 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 131 

to remove the seeds. Add the skins to the pulp, cooking till tender. Allow 
one-half pound of sugar to each pound of fruit. 

Gooseberries with Currant Juice. — The tops and tails being removed 
from the gooseberries, allow an equal quantity of finely-pounded loaf sugar 
and put a layer of each alternately into a large, deep jar; pour into it as 
much dripped red ctirrant juice as will dissolve the sugar, adding its 
weight in sugar. The next day put all in a preserving pan, boil it, and 
put up as other jams. 

Grape Marmalade. — Choose ripe grapes of any familiar kind, and place 
them in the preserving kettle with just enough water to prevent their 
burning. Cook slowly at the side of the stove until they are well broken 
and mashed. Then press through a sieve and measure the pulp. For 
each pint allow half a pound of sugar. Place the grape pulp over the 
fire, boil for 20 minutes, add the sugar and boil from 10 to 30 minutes 
longer, or until a drop of the mixture when put on a plate will retain its 
shape without spreading. Stir constantly while cooking. Skim carefully 
from time to time and when done pack in small jars. 

Grape and Apple Marmalade. — Many people do not care for the flavor 
of the Clinton grape, but it is excelletit to use with sweet apples in mar- 
malade, following a New England recipe, in which the wild frost grape is 
ordinarily used. Heat four pounds of stemmed and pulped grapes until 
the seeds are free of pulp. Have four pounds of sweet apples pared, cored, 
sliced and steamed until tender. Sift the grape pulp, add the apples, turn 
into a kettle set on asbestos mat or back of range and simmer slowly for 
two hours; measure, add sugar in the proportion of three-quarters of a 
pound to a pint of pulp, and cook until a little, chilled on ice, shows that 
it is stiff enough to retain its shape. Turn into jelly glasses and seal. 

Grape Preserves. — Press the pulp out of each grape; boil the pulps 
until tender, then press through colander to remove the seeds ; mix the 
skins with the pulp and juice ; add as many cupfuls of sugar as there are 
of grapes and boil together until thickened. Green grapes are preserve'! 
by cutting each grape in halves, taking out the seeds, then adding an equal 
quantity of sugar and boiling all together until the right consistency; seal 
while hot. 

Spiced Grapes. — Press the skins from the grapes and put the pulp 
through the colander; add the skins and weigh. To every pound of 
grapes add one cupful of vinegar, two ounces of powdered cinnamon, one 
ounce of powdered cloves and three and a half pounds of sugar; boil an 
hour and a half until thick, then bottle. Small Damson plums are very 
nice prepared in the same way. 

Marmalades.— One simple process will serve for all kinds of marma- 
lade, and that is to cook the fruit in its own juice to a state of collapse. 
Then press through a colander, measure, bring to a boil, and skim, before 



]S2 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

adding the sugar — measure for measure. Cook with care after the sugar 
scum begins to thicken. When the juice rolls up a jelly on a cold silver 
spoon, the marmalade is ready for pint can, or for glasses, covered when 
cold with one-fourth inch, at the least, of hot paraffin. All the small fruits 
make delicious marmalades when pressed through a fine colander or sieve 
to remove the seeds. Grapes and blackberries do not require full measure 
for measure of sugar. Plums are easily converted into a palatable mar- 
malade after removing the pits, but they are more easily made into pre- 
serves, the same as peaches, and quinces ; both are too good for marma- 
lades. By the following method clingstone peaches can be utilized, also 
imperfect pears and quinces. Pare the peaches and cut into pieces as 
small as a cherry, pack into a measuring dish and note the amount. Add 
water to prevent burning and cook thoroughly before adding the sugar — 
measure for measure. Boil with care the same as for marmalade, and 
place in airtight cans. 

Pineapple Marmalade. — Use thoroughly ripe pineapples, peel them, and 
after removing the hard core, chop them. To each pound of fruit and 
juice, add a pound of sugar, and simmer one hour. Frequent skimming 
and stirring will be necessary. Coof some of it, and if not thick enough, 
continue the boiling half an hour longer. An asbestos cover slipped under 
the kettle is a safeguard against scorching. Crab-apple and plum marma- 
lade is excellent. Use the Siberian crab-apples and Bradshaw or other 
violet red plums. Allow two parts apples to one part plums. Wash the 
fruit and cut out the imperfections. Simmer both kinds until soft, then 
rub through a sieve. Allow a pound of sugar to each pint of fruit puip. 
Put the sugar in the oven to heat, and cook the fruit 20 minutes in a 
porcelain-lined or agate kettle. Add the hot sugar, skim, and cook 30 
minutes longer. Stir very often. 

Peach Marmalade. — Use Wrvci late peaches. Peel the peaches and cut 
them- in halves. Crack two-thirds of the kernels, blanch them, and cut 
into lengthwise strips. Put the peaches over the fire with three-fourths 
of a pound of sugar to each pound of fruit. Stir frequently and cook 
from 20 minutes to half an hour. Five minutes before removing from 
the fire add the blanched kernels. 

Quince Marmalade. — Rub the fruit with a cloth, cut out the flower end, 
and chop without removing the skins and cores. Cook until soft enough 
to rub through a sieve. Strain the fruit and add three-quarters pound o"f 
sugar to a pound of fruit. Cook slowly until done, which should be in 
15 or 20 minutes. Apple marmalade affords a change from cider apple 
sauce and stewed apples. Take seven pounds of apples (Fall Pippins are 
nice) and stew them with a pint of water. Put them through a sieve, 
add three-quarters pound of sugar to a pound of pulp, also the juice 
and grated yellow rind of three lemons. Boil half hour, then add a little

ginger root. This may be made of one-third quince and two-thirds apples, 
leaving out the ginger and lemons. 

Mixed Marmalade.— Take equal quantities of peaches, apples, pears 
and quinces that have been pared, cored and cut in eighths. Cook quinces 
in water to cover until almost tender. Drain and measure the water. 
For si.x pounds of mixed fruit there should be one pint of water. Add 
quinces to the other fruit, place in preserve kettle with water, and let 
them cook thoroughly, but not burn. Take out and mash well together. 
Measure. Clean the kettle and put them back with half their weight in 
granulated sugar. Let them cook very slowly two hours. Keep them 
stirred well from the bottom and protect with an asbestos mat or set the 
kettle in anolher containing boiling water, as on no account must the jam 
burn. Seal in small jars. 

Orange and Apple Marmalade. — Cut the apples in small pieces with- 
out peeling them and add a pint of water for every quart of applos. Boil 
them down for half an hour and strain through a sieve. Add the juice 
and pulp of tht'ee oranges and a little of the yellow peel cut fine to every 
pmt of apple pulp. To each pint of the mixture, add three-fourths of a 
pound of sugar. Boil the marmalade until it curls before the finger when 
it is cooled for trial. 

Preserved Melon Rind. — Pare the melon very thin; do not pare away 
all the ripened melon. Leave about one-quarter inch attached to the rind. 
Cut in pieces and place in a crock over night with salt sprinkled between 
the layers. In the morning drain, pour boiiing water over, leave for 
one-half hour, drain agam. New weigh the fruit — to 10 pounds fruit add 
five pounds granulated sugar, one-half gallon white vinegar, one ounce 
stick cinnamon, one ounce white ginger root, and one-half ounce whole 
cloves. Tie the spice in small muslin bags, place all in a large pan and 
boil slowly. The longer it boils the nicer will it be. 

Milk, Canning. — A correspondent tells us she has canned milk in this 
way and kept it a year : Allow the milk to become perfectly cold, then 
fill sterilized fruit jars to within a half inch of the top; put on the 
covers loosely and set into a clean boi'er on a board with holes through ; 
fill boiler with cold water to within an inch of the tops of the jars; bring 
the water to the boiling point and allow it to boil 20 minutes after ebulli- 
tion begins, then remove the cans one by one, put on new rubbers, fill 
with boiling milk, screw the covers on and invert the cans till cold. Pit 
away in a cool, dark place and use when the cows have dried up. Of 
course this will taste like scalded milk, but for all purposes except drink- 
ing it is all right. As the cream does not dry, it can readily be mixed 
with the milk if desired. If directions are followed carefully and every- 
thing used made perfectly clean little or none will spoil. It is quite 



134 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

essential to use new rubber rings, as old ones become hard and will not 
make the jars tight. 

Or-ra-cur.— Five pounds of currants, five pounds of sugar, juice and 
grated rinds of three oranges, one pound of raisins, chopped and stoned; 
boil all together for 20 minutes, and put away in jelly glasses. 

Peach Butter, — This is a nice way to use tip peaches that are too ripe 
for canning or pickling. Pare ripe peaches, put in a kettle with sufficient 
water to cover peaches ; when soft run through a colander, the stones 
being thus easily removed. To each quart of peaches thus prepared add 
V/2 pound of granulated sugar. Boil slowly till thick ; add ground cinna- 
mon to taste. This, like all butters and marmalades, requires constant 
watching to keep the fruit from burning. 

Spiced Peaches. — Weigh eight pounds of freestone peaches after they 
have been peeled, halved and the stones taken out. Put peaches in a por- 
celain lined kettle with one pint of vinegar and five pounds of sugar 
(granulated). Mix one ounce each of cinnamon sticks, whole mace 
and green ginger and one-half ounce of whole cloves. Divide into eight 
parts, tie each in a piece of cheesecloth and drop in the kettle with the 
peaches. Simmer until the fruit is tender, then lift it with a skimmer 
and put it in sterilized jars. Boil the syrup a minute, skim, lift out the 
bags, then pcur over the fruit in the jars. It is an improvement to break 
.'lS peach stones, blanch the kernels in boiling water and add them to 
liic syrup just before pouring it into the jars. 

Peach Jam. — Pare, stone and cut into thin slices half a peck of free- 
stone peaches. Weigh. To each pound of fruit add three-quarters of a 
pound of granulated sugar. Put in layers in a preserve kettle and let 
them cook gently until clear, which will probably take an hour. Have 
ready cracked one-third the peach stones, remove and blanch the kernels, 
then slice them thin and sprinkle them among the layers of peaches so all 
can cook together. Put into small glass jars or tumblers when cold. 
Shut up air-tight. 

Peach Leather. — Pare fully ripe peaches (yellow ones preferred) ; 
remove the pits and weigh. To each pound of fruit add one-fourth pound 
of granulated sugar. Put in stew kettle and cook slowly, mashing the 
fruit as it boils. When cooked to a thick paste spread on a buttered 
board and put in the sun to dry. Put out the second day and when dry 
enough that it will not stick, loll up like a roll of leather and keep in a 
cool, dry place. Slice from the end of the roll. 

Pears in Cider. — One of our friends reports that Kiefler pears are 
delicious canned in sweet cider. The customary syrup is made by melt 
ing sugar in the cider, and the pears are cooked in this (not over-cooked) 
either in the jars or in a kettle. The cider is said to give much richness 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 135 

of flavor. Pears were also canned in perry (pear cider), but the result 
was not considered so desirable as where the apple juice was used. 

Pear Chips. — Four pounds of Duchess or other hard pears sliced thin, 
four pounds of sugar, the juice of three lemons and grated rind of one, 
one ounce of dry or green ginger root chopped fine and one-half tumbler 
of water. Cook until clear, then seal in jelly glasses. 

Pear Syrup. — Very nice syrup may be made from pears, core and 
pare them; cover with cold water and set on back of stove, let simmer 
until soft, then dip off juice carefully or strain through a colander. If 
the juice is not clear strain tlirough a fine strainer. Return to the fire 
and boil down rapidly to about one-quarter, then add sugar, about as for 
jelly, a cupful of sugar to a cupful of juice. Boil until the syrup is thick 
as you wish and put in glass jars. This, when properly made, is thought 
to be as nice as maple syrup. The flavor may be varied a little by using 
a very little lemon juice or green ginger. If desirable, the cooked pears 
may. be used by boiling them a short time with a little sugar, or with 
sugar and vinegar. 

Persimmon Figs. — Gather them, and press each fruit between thumb 
and finger, and put in layers in an open-mouthed jar with a thin layer of 
sugar between the layers of fruit and sugar on the top. After a few 
weeks, say three or four, lay on a platter or plate in single layers and 
dry in a very cool oven or in the sun. 

Canned Plums Without Cooking. — This recipe comes from the plum 
belt of central New York, and will be found very satisfactory: Take 
enough large yellow egg plums to fill a quart can. Put them into a 
granite or earthen pan and pour boiling water over them, let stand three 
minutes, then drain. Pour over more boiling water, which will crack 
the skins. Remove the skins, and place the plums carefully in a hot 
sterilized glass jar. Have ready a thick syrup made by boiling two 
cupfuls of granulated sugar that has been moistened with water, and 
cooked to the "brittle stage." Pour the boiling syrup over the plums and 
seal. The syrup will form like "icicles," but after a day or two will 
dissolve. Make enough syrup for two or three cans at once, as it is 
hard to tell just how much it will take to fill a can. They always keep 
perfectly, and retain their flavor much better than when cooked, but the 
secret is in having everything boiling hot. 

Plum Cheese. — For economy make this on the same day you make 
plum jelly. After extracting the jelly juice pass the remaining pulp 
through a colander to remove skins and pits, then weigh. Add a pound 
of sugar to every two pounds of plums and boil one-half an hour; seal up. 

Plums in Cold Water.— A housekeeper who has had experience with 
the cold-water process of keeping fruit says she has kept wild plums 
all Winter in this way, putting them in a large stone jar and covering 



136 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

them with enough cold water to leave about four inches over them. A 
saucer or plate with a weight on it must be placed on top of the fruit 
to keep the top layers deep enough under the water. To make sauce 
from wild plums kept in this way, take out as many of the fruit as are 
required, and parboil until the skins crack in water containifig a pinch 
of baking soda. Then rinse well in clear cold water, drop into boiling 
syrup, and cook until done. This makes a delicious sauce ; the parboiling 
with the soda takes the "pucker" out of the fruit. Cranberries will keep 
for months if covered with cold water as described, and many house- 
keepers put up green currants and gooseberries, also rhubarb, in the same 
way. 

Plum Conserve. — Five pounds plums, peeled and pitted; five pounds 
sugar; cook plums 20 minutes before adding sugar. Put in sugar and 
boil a little, then add two pounds seeded raisins (cut into small pieces), 
grated rind of four oranges and the pulp chipped (easier to cut with 
scissors). Cook to a thick conserve (15 to 30 minutes), and put in jelly 
glasses. Cherries (snin-) are good used instead of plums; pit them. 
Currants may also be used instead of plums. 

Pineapple and Plum Jam. — Twelve pounds of large plums, five large 
pineapples, one quart of water and sugar in the proportion of three- 
quarters of a pound to every pound of fruit, and one pound to every pint 
of water. Peel and pit the plums, add the water, bring to the boiling 
point, add the pineapple cut in dice and boil, until soft and thick, then 
add the sugar and cook three-quarters of an hour longer. 

.Spiced Plums. — Spiced plums are the best of relishes with game, poul 
try, and mutton. Wash, drain, pick and weigh the plums, prick the skins 
lightly, then pack them down in earthen jars with one-half their own 
weigh of sugar. Strew through the fruit while packing plenty of whole 
cloves, whole allspice, mace, ginger slightly bruised and stick cinnamon. 
Put in also a few whole black peppercorns, and to each jar allot a single 
pod of the small red pepper. Take half a pint of cider vinegar for each 
pound of fruit, add to it as much sugar as the fruit was packed in, bring 
to a boil, skim well and pour over it scalding hot. Let stand 24 hours, 
then drain off the syrup, boil up, skim and return to the fruit. Do this 
three times, then put fruit and syrup together in the kettle, let them boil 
five minutes, skimming well, fill jars and cover. 

Canned Pumpkin. — This will supply pie material when stored pump- 
kins are gone. Cook the pumpkin and strain it, just as you do for pies, 
being careful not to have much, water in it. Fill the can full. Shake 
down so as to have them solid. Put on the tops, screw down just a 
little, so you can lift by them, place in boiler, with something between 
the cans and boiler on the bottom, fill to the neck of cans with water 
and boil one good hour. Take out and wipe the necks of the cans, and 



THE RURAL COOK BCOK. 137 

if the pumpkin has shrunk away, fill cans up with boiling water, put on 
rings and screw down the tops tight, and the pumpkin will keep six 
months in a good, cool place. 

Quince Butter. — Use half a gallon of quinces pared and cored, half 
a gallon of tart apples pared and cored, two quarts of sweet cider, one 
pint of cold water. Cover the crock and stew gently until, the fruit is 
very soft; then pass through a sieve. Add five cupfuls of sugar and 
cook until soft. 

Canned Quinces. — Prepa,re the quinces by paring, coring and quarter- 
ing. Use a silver knife. Keep the prepared quinces in cold water to 
prevent them from discoloring until sufficient have been prepared. Cook 
the quinces in boiling water slowly till tender. Have ready a syrup of 
one-half pound of sygar and a pint of water to each pound of fruit. Put 
the cooked quinces in the syrup, allowing them to remain five minutes. 
Then can and seal while hot. 

Quince Honey. — One medium quince and one cupful of granulated 
sugar will make one jelly glass of honey. Pare and grate the quinces, 
then stir this grated pulp into a boiling syrup made of the sugar and 
enough water to dissolve it. Stir slowly and quite often until the pulp 
will remain suspended through the syrup. One should not get it too 
stiflf. Put into jelly glasses, and when cool cover in the same way you 
do preserves and jellies, and keep in the preserve closet. 

Quince Jam. — Take one pint of quince juice left from preserves, add 
one pound of sliced apples, three-q.uarters of a pound of sugar; boil two 
hours, stirring well; pour into glasses while hot and seal. 

Quince and Pear Sauce.— Three pounds light brown sugar, six pounds 
pears, quartered if large, small ones cut in halves; nine pounds quinces, 
quartered. Boil sugar, pears and quinces nearly all day, taking care not 
to let them cook too rapidly, until both pears and quinces are of a rich 
red, and the juice an amber syrup. Can and seal tight. The fruit keeps 
its shape, the pears having gained a fine flavor from the quinces, and the 
quinces having an added goodness from the pears. 

Raisine Bourgogne.— Stem and seed two pounds of ripe grapes. Boil 
with one cup of water until soft. Press through a sieve and add two 
pounds of ripe pears, peeled and sliced; cook until reduced to half the 
amouTit. Weigh and add an equal amount of sugar, stir until the sugar 
is dissolved, strain again, put in small earthen jars, set in a plate-warm- 
ing oven for a day or until firm to the touch. Tie down and keep in a 
cool place. 

Raspberry and Currant Bar-le-Duc— To four pounds of raspberries 
add one pound of currants; bruise the currants and strain the juice; add 
to it three-quarters of a pound of sugar to each pound of juice, including 
ihe weight of the berries left whole. Boil 20 minutes and skim, add the 



138 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

raspberries, cook 20 minutes more. When the syrup jellies on a plate, 
take off and place in glasses or small jars while hot. 

Canned Raspberries.— (Mrs. Mapes's recipe) .—First make a syrup by 
boiling seven pounds granulated sugar in 3^ quarts water. Fill cans with 
fresh berries, putting in as many as possible without crushing the berries. 
Apply covers without the rubbers, and set in a kettle or boiler of cold 
water, so the water comes about two-thirds of the height of the cans. 
Bring to a boil and cook seven to 10 minutes after boiling begins. Now 
take the cans out of the water, remove the covers, fill with hot syrup 
brimming full, and seal up tight in the usual way. 

Uncooked Canned Rhubarb. — Wash, peel, cut into inch cubes and 
fill compactly into glass jar, then pour slowly into the jar good fresh 
water to overflowing. Adjust lubber, screw on the top and set away in 
a cool place until morning. Then if there be any air bubbles, tap the 
side of the jar, fill again to the brim with water and screw on cover 
tightly. If tops and rubbers are perfect the rhubarb will keep until used. 

Canned Rhubarb, — Wash it, cut into inch pieces, put in a preserving 
kettle, and let it come to a good boil all through, without a particle 
of sugar. It will keep perfectly. When you wish to open it for use, 
take one cupful of sugar for a pie, and it will be like the fresh pie plant. 
For a small family, the pint cans are much better for any fruit. 

Rhubarb Jam with Ginger. — String some rhubarb, cut into short 
lengths, and weigh. Put into f. kettle and add just enough water to pre- 
vent burning. When it has become quite soft, add sugar, one pound for 
each pound of rhubarb. Stir well until the jam becomes rich and syrupy. 
For each pound take about a teaspoonful of ground ginger, rub it smooth 
with a little water, and add it to your jam. Boil up jam again, stirring 
well ; put into glasses, and when cold cover. If a large amount of rhu- 
barb is at command, a high grade of brown sugar is very good; the only 
difference seems to be that the jam is not quite so clear. 

Rhubarb Jelly. — ^Make when the rhubarb is tender, using the pink 
variety without peeling it, as much of the flavor and all of the color is 
in the skin. Cook eight pounds of rhubarb with the yellow part of thi- 
peel from three lemons, in a covered dish, vmtil all the juice of the rhu- 
barb is free. Strain, and add all the juice that can be extracted from 
the three lemons. Boil half an hour and strain through a bag. To 
each cupful of this juice add a cup and a quarter of granulated sugar, 
which should be heated before putting into the juice. Stir until the 
sugar is entirely dissolved, then boil without stirring until it jellies when 
tested. A fine jelly which may be made later in the season has three- 
fourths of a pound of tart apples (peeled and cored) cut and cooked 
with each pound of rhubarb. Cook until soft and drain through bag 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 139 

without pressing. Allow a cup of vinegar to each cup of juice and 
proceed as in former recipe. 

Rhubarb and Orange Jam.— To a quart of cut up rhubarb, add half 
a dozen oranges, peeled, cut up and with the pits removed, and a pound 
and a half of sugar. Boil gently until a little set on a plate will jelly. 
This can b° varied by slicing the peel of three oranges in thin strips and 
adding it to the fruit. This jam will also keep indefinitely in earthen 
jars, or jelly glasses which have been sealed with paraffin. 

Rhubarb and Pineapple. — The following rule for canning is a decided 
improvement upon pineapple alone, and the rhubarb taste disappears. 
Chop and eook equal parts of pineapple and rhubarb, and add a cupful 
of sugar for each pint jar. 

Rhubarb Marmalade. — Peel the rhubarb, and cut into pieces one-half 
inch long. Put into a large earthen bowl, and cover with sugar in the 
proportion of one pound of sugar to one quart of rhubarb. Allow this to 
stand over night, or 15 to IS hours. Be sure that the bowl is amply 
large, as there will be a flood of juice by morning. Strain off the juice 
and sugar into a preserving kettle ; when it begins to boil, add the rhu- 
barb. Boil slowly for an hour, or until the preserve assumes a deep 
red color, stirring carefully to prevent burning, and removing any scum 
that rises to the top. About 13 or 20 minutes before removing from the 
fire, peel the yellow rind from one lemon, chop it fine, and add to the 
preserve, to.gether with the juice of two lemons, this being our usual 
proportion to about four or five quarts of preserve, but the quantity of 
lemon may be varied to suit the taste. This gives a piquant flavor other- 
wise lacking, in spite of the acidity of the rhubarb. When bottled, keep 
in a cool, dark place. This rhubarb jam is very nice in open tarts, or as 
a filling for boiled roly puddings. 

Rhubarb and Almond Marmalade.— Cut rhubarb up very fine, and to 
each cupful add the pulp and juice of one orange, one teaspoonful of the 
grated yellow of the rind, one tablespoonful lemon juice and one and one- 
half cup of sugar. Let stand until tlje sugar is dissolved, boil rapidly 
until transparent, then add one-half cup of blanched almonds cut in 
\\i\n slices, boil up once and put in glasses. 

Hackensack Rhubarb Marmalade.— Cut a pound and a half of rhubarb 
into inch lengths and put it in an earthen dish. Scatter over this a 
quarter of a pound of figs and an ounce of candied peel (both cut fine) ; 
over all sprinkle a pound and a quarter of sugar and let stand over 
night. In the morning boil for about 15 minutes, then add a pound 
of either orange or lemon pulp, cut fine, and cook until heavy enough to 
be firm when cold. Put in jelly glasses, and when cool cover with paraf- 
fin or any other material used for keeping air from jellies. 

Rhubarb and Fig Marmalade.— Three pounds of rhubarb, three pounds 



140 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

of sugar, one pound of figs, juice of one lemon and grated rind of half. 
Wash the figs and cut fine and put in the bottom of the kettle; cut rhu- 
barb into inch cubes and spread evenly over the figs; over the rhubarb 
distribute one pound of the sugar and let stand over night. In the morn- 
ing cook slowly until it looks clear, then add remainder of sugar and cook 
until thick. About fifteen minutes before taking from the stove add 
juice and rind of lemon. This quantity will make two quarts of mar- 
malade. It can be sealed while hot, or put in jelly glasses and covered 
with paraffin. 

Rhubarb and Orange Marmalade. — Three pounds of rhubarb, four 
and one-half pounds of sugar, three oranges, the grated rind of one 
orange. After grating the yellow from one orange, remove the peel 
from all three and cut in small pieces. Cut the rhubarb in inch cubes, 
mix with one and one-half pounds of sugar and the oranges and let 
stand twenty-four hours: Cock until it looks clear, then heat the re- 
maining three pounds of sugar, add, and cook until thick. 

Rhubarb and Raisin Marmalade. — Four pounds rhubarb, four oranges, 
juice of all, peel of two; four pounds sugar, one lemon, two pounds of 
raisins. Peel and cut the rhubarb into half-inch pieces.. Prepare the 
oranges by squeezing out juice and cooking the peel in water till tender. 
Drain and scrape out white skin. Extract the juice of the lemon. Put 
the rhubarb into a granite preserving kettle, heat it slowly to boiling, 
cook fifteen minutes, then add the sugar, orange juice and peel, lemon 
juice and raisins, and cook slowly until thick. 

Spiced Rhubarb.— Peel and slice 2^ pounds of rhubarb; sprinkle a 
pound of sugar over it and let stand until morning. Drain off the syrup 
and add one cup of sugar and half a cupful each of vinegar and water. 
Drop into this syrup small bags filled with a mixture composed of one- 
third of a teaspoonful each of cloves, mace, allspice and ginger, and a 
teaspoonful of cinnamon. Boil until the syrup begins to thicken, then 
take out the bags and add the rhubarb and cook until clear. 

Canned Strawberries. — To can strawberries so that they will keep 
their shape and color, after the bcJrries are picked over, put them in n 
jar, with a layer of sugar and then of berries until all are used. Set 
them in the cellar over night, and the sugar will penetrate them, and no 
water must be added: there will be sufficient juice. Have a sugar syrup 
on the stove hot, put the strawberries in and let them boil up gently,: 
then fill cans with the fruit and juice all cooked together. Screw on 
the cover, stand the can upside down a few minutes, then turn again,, 
changing it in this way until it is cool, and the berries will not rise to 
the top. This way preserves the shape, color, and flavor of the fruit. 

Canned Strawberries, No. 2.— An excellent way to can strawberries, 
raspberries or any fruit that requires little or no cooking is the follow- 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 141 

ing : Prepare fruit carefully, discarding all blemished or imperfect berries. 
Prepare a syrup of one quart of water boiled, one cupful of sugar. More 
or less sugar may be added according to the taste of family and the 
acidity of the fruit to be canned. Have jars thoroughly sterilized as 
above, fill with the prepared fruit, pour over the syrup until it is filled to 
the brim. Screw on cap after adjusting rubber. Place jars in a stone 
crock with thin strips of board or a cloth under them and pour around 
them enough boiling water to fill crock up to the rubbers on jars. Cover 
with blankets, carpets, etc., to exclude air, and leave over night or until 
the water is cold. Canned in this way soft fruits keep both shape and 
color, and very nearly resemble fresh fruit. Fruits that lose color, such 
a,': strawberries or red raspberries, should have paper bags or pasteboard 
boxes slipped over them to exclude the light. 

Canned Strawberries, No. 3. — Fill a quart jar with large, ripe berries, 
from which the hulls have been taken; fill the jar with cold water; then 
pour It out again into a measure. For every twelve jars to be put up 
use thirteen of these measures of water and in it dissolve six pounds of 
sugar. Pack the jar with berries as closely as possible without mashing 
them. Fill each jar up to the shoulder with syrup, cover loosely with 
the lid and set it in a large boiler, which should haye a loosely fitting 
v/ooden bottom pierced with holes. If set on the metal bottom the jars 
are liable to crack. When the boiler is full of jars pour in cold water 
up to their shoulders; cover it and set it on the fire. At the same time 
put the surplus syrup in a saucepan and allow it to become hot. As soon 
as the water in the boiler begins to boil note the time, and when it has 
boiled for eight minutes remove the boiler from the fire. Take out one 
jar at a time, fill it even with the hot syrup in the saucepan, fasten it 
airtight and stand it back in the boiler until all are filled and covered; 
let them stand there until cold, and then store in a cool place. 

Uncooked Canned Strawberries. — A correspondent of the Chicago 
Record-Herald says that she has preserved strawberries and red raspber- 
ries without cooking for years with entire success. Her method is as fol- 
lows : Mash together with a silver fork equal quantities of fruit and sugar. 
Let stand for an hour or more until the sugar is entirely dissolved. 
Then put into jelly glasses or pint jars, filling to the brim. Leave un- 
covered for 48 hours in an open window exposed to the sun. Then seal 
in the usual way and keep in a cool, dark place. The flavor of the ber- 
ries is as when picked, and the jam is rich and delicious. All utensils 
used must be absolutely clean and jars sterilized. 

Dried Strawberries. — One quart of strawberries, clean off the stem and 
hull. Wash; add one pound of granulated sugar, put in a porcelain 
or granite kettle, set on stove, and heat gently till they come to a boiling 
point, then boil hard for 20 minutes. Do not stir, just shake the kettle 



143 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

cnongh to keep from burning, then pour out on large plates, and dry 
in the sun for at least three days, or until the juice has become jellied; 
't may take a longer time or a little less according to heat of sun. Do 
not let them stay out of doors over night, as the dew will cause the 
juice to get thin again. When the juice has become jellied, pack in jars 
and make airtight. These are most delicious and very delicate in flavor; 
the berries are whole and cleai. 

Strawberry and Currant Jam. — To every pound of fruit allow three- 
quarters of a pound of sugar, also one pint of red currant juice to every 
four pounds of the berries. Boil the currant juice with the strawberries 
for half an hour, stirring all the time, then add the sugar and boil 20 
minutes longer, skimming carefully. Put in small jars or tumblers with 
paraffin on top. The currant juice may be omitted. 

Wiesbaden Strawberries.— Take six. pounds of strawberries — they need 
not be large or extra fine, but they must be sound; add to them in the 
kettle a very little cold water and cook slowly as for jelly. Pour in a 
jelly bag and allow them to drip overnight. In the morning add to the 
juice six pounds of broken loaf or granulated sugar and half a pound 
of strained honey. Boil to a very thick syrup Fill pint cans with freshly 
capped strawberries, the largest and finest to be had. Screw on the tops, 
i)Et in cold water in a large kettle — the wash boiler will do — and let the 
water come to a boil. Open the jars and fill to the brim with the 
hot synip. Seal and put away in a cool, dark place. 

Tomato Butter. — Cook ripe tomatoes, salt to taste and put them 
through a colander to remove the seeds. Have ready an equal quantity 
of sour apple sauce, well cooked ; add it to the tomatoes, sweeten slightly 
and let it boil until the mixture begins to thicken. Be careful that it does 
not burn. Seal in jelly glasses. Excellent to serve with meats. 

Tomato Butter No. 3. — Seven pounds of large, ripe tomatoes, four 
pounds of brown sugar, half a cupful of vinegar, one teaspoonful of 
c'nnamon, one teaspoonful of cloves. Pour boiling water over the toma- 
toes ; let stand five minutes, then the skins can be rubbed ofiF. Remove 
stem end, then slice tomatoes. Cook until soft, add the sugar and stew 
until very thick; then add spices and vinegar. Let simmer 30 minutes, 
pour into jars and seal. 

Tomato and Apple Butter. — Scald and skin ripe tomatoes, add a 
quarter of the quantity of pared, cored and quartered pleasant sour 
apples. Weigh the kettle, put in the tomatoes and apples and cook to the 
consistency of marmalade, then to every six pounds add a teaspoonful of 
ginger, the juice of a large lemon and four pounds of light brown sugar; 
boil fifteen minutes, or until it will spread smoothly. 

Green Tomato Butter. — Select tomatoes that are full grown, but quite 
green. Slice them thin. Make a syrup in proportion of one pound of 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 143 

sugar to two pounds of tomatoes. Boil down slowly for four hours or 
until the butter is smooth and thick, stirring frequently to prevent stick- 
ing. Flavor with lemon wh'in done. 

Green Tomato Conserve. — For one peck of green tomatoes, slice six 
lemons without removing the skin, but taking out the seeds. Put to this 
quantity six pounds of sugar and boil until transparent and the syrup 
thick. Ginger root may be added if liked. 

Tomato Jam. — Select sound, ripe fruit and peel and quarter them. 
Then put them into the preserving kettle with an equal weight of loaf 
sugar, the strained juice and rind of a lemon for every four pounds of 
the fruit, and a little powdered ginger. Cook the mixture slowly until 
it jellies when tried on a spoon. Turn into jars and cover. 

Tomato Marmalade. — Remove the skin from four quarts of ripe 
tomatoes and slice. Cut six large lemons in halves, lengthwise, and slice 
very thin. Seed one cup of raisins. Put the tomatoes, raisins and 
lemons into a preserving kettle, in layers, alternating with four pounds 
of granulated sugar. Cook one hour on the front of stove. Then set 
the kettle back, and allow contents to simmer imtil it is of the consistency 
of marmalade. Put up, while hot, as jelly. This recipe makes about 
two and one-half quarts. When properly prepared no one article will be 
recognizable. The small yellow tomatoes are nice for such use. 

Tomato Marmalade No. 2. — For every two pounds of the tomatoes 
allow two pounds of sugar and the juice and grated rind of 'one lemon. 
Pour scalding wat.er over the tomatoes to loosen the skins. After remov- 
ing the skin, mix the tomatoes with the sugar and boil slowly for one 
hour, stirring and skimming frequently. At the end of that time add 
the lemon juice and rind and cook another hour or until the whole is 
a thick, smooth mass. 

Tomato Mock-Orange Marmalade. — Scald and peel large-sized yellow 
tomatoes. Cut downward over each seed section, press open and remove 
all seeds with the thumb, leaving the pulp comparatively whole. To two 
parts of the prepared tomatoes allow one part of oranges, slicing thinly. 
Cover all with an equal quantity of sugar and let stand over night. In 
the morning pour off syrup and cook down about half, add the tomatoes 
and oranges and cook until the orange skins are transparent. Seal in 
jelly glasses. This is an original recipe, and is a delightful substitute 
for the genuine orange marmalade, though much cheaper. 

Tomato Mincemeat— Chop fine four quarts of green tomatoes, drain 
off juice, cover with ccld water and bring to a boil, scalding for 30 
minutes, then drain. Repeat till parboiled three times. Add two pounds 
brown sugar, one pound seeded raisins, one-half pound chopped citron, 
one large half cup chopped suet, one tablespodnful salt and one-half cup 



144 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

strong vinegar. Mix and cook until thick. When cold add one tea- 
spoonful each of ground cinnamon and cloves, and one tablespoonful of 
grated nutmeg (or suit taste). Mix thoroughly, and keep in open jar. 

Tomato Clove Preserves.— To four pounds of yellow plum tomatoes, 
not too ripe, allow four poimds of sugar, three lemons and one-half 
ounce (or according to taste) of whole cloves. Peel the tomatoes with- 
out breaking, sprinkle sugar over and let them stand over night. , In the 
morning pour off the syrup, add the cloves and let it boil until thick, then 
strain. Return to fire and add the chopped pulp of the lemons, rejecting 
the skin, and the tomatoes, and cook gently until the tomatoes look clear. 
Put into jar? and seal. To give a quite different flavor substitute one- 
half ounce of ginger root for the cloves, and proceed as above. 

Green Tomato Preserves. — Required, eight pounds of small green 
tomatoes, seven pounds of sugar, one ounce of ginger and mace mixed, 
and the juice of four lemons. Pierce each of the tomatoes with a fork 
and put them in the preserving kettle with all the other ingredients.' Heat 
slowly, then boil until the tomatoes are clear, then skim them out and boil 
the syrup until thick. Put the tomatoes into jars and pour in the 
hot syrup. 

Yellow Tomato Preserves. — Put the tomatoes into a wire basket and 
plunge into boiling water to loosen the skins. When a cut is made across 
the skin its whole contents can be quickly squeezed out. Three-fourths 
cf a pound, of sugar is allov/ed for each pound of the fruit pulj), and 
sometimes ginger root is added for flavoring. Prolonged cooking is not 
necessary; just before ready for the jars add several lemons sliced in 
thin even circles. 

Ruby Watermelon Preserves. — Dice the red portion of the melon, 
removing all seeds and every bit of the white part; weigh and use halt 
as much sugar as you have melon, adding to every six pounds of melon 
the juice and grated yellow rinds of two lemons. Put all together in a 
large granite kettle and boil slowly, stirring often until it is quite thick; 
at first you will think it is all going to water, but very soon you will 
notice it thicken nicely; when it has become as thick as you like it, seal 
hot in glass pint jars. 



JELLIES. 

Jelly should never be stored in a cellar. It demands a cool, dry, dark 
place, which can be well ventilated, to insure its keeping perfectly. Great 
care must be given the juice, sugar, etc. The glasses should be hot, dry 
and clean (.surgically clean, we mean). Small tapering cups or bowls 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 145 

make jelly a nicer shape to turn out to serve, but the regulation jelly glass 
withlits tin top comes much cheaper. 

A safe rule with all fruits that do not get firm is to add sufficient sour 
apple juice to make the jelly the right consistency. By choosing a bright 
day, boiling the juice 20 minutes before adding the sugar and going strictly 
according to directions even an amateur can have success. The best 
jellies are not boiled as hard as wanted but sunned under glass for 
several days. 

For filling the glasses, use a china cup with a handle. A saucer or 
small plate held in the left hand and moved with and under the cup will 
catch all drops. In case you do not fill a tumbler full from the first dip 
add the requisite quantity immediately afterward, so that all will stiffen 
together, otherwise there may be separation in the contents of the tumbler 
when it is turned out. As a general rule for jelly, wash and drain the 
fruit, then put it on the stove in a large stone crock, or in a granite 
vessel. The fruit should be mature, but not overripe. Add no water 
to small and juicy fruits. Large fruits, such as apples, peaches and pears, 
require some water; our rule is to put the fruit in the crock, and pour in 
enough water to show at the top. Cook slowly, but thoroughly, stirring 
the fruit, which will thus be sufficiently mashed. Strain through a flannel 
bag, which should be scalded first, or through a stout cotton or linen; the 
flannel insures clearness, but we have no trouble with this when properly 
boiled, nor do we add white of egg, as some cooks recommend. Most 
people advise letting the fruit drain over night, and boiling the next day, 
but we think it jellies better if the fruit is cooked, drained, and the juice 
boiled the same day. The bag is of course hung over a large china bowl, 
and pressed down a little with a wooden spoon; its own weight, however, 
soon drains it dry. The juice is measured, and put on to boil ; granulated 
sugar is measured, cup for cup, and put in a bowl on the back of the 
stove, where it is heated, being stirred from time to time, so that by the 
time the juice boils it is well heated through. Any scum that arises is 
skimmed off, and as soon as the juice comes to a boil the warmed sugar 
is stirred in. Continue to skim it as needed, and notice when it comes 
to a boil. Currant jelly made in this way will only need three minutes' 
boiling; other small fruits a little longer; they should be tested in a little 
cup. If boiled too long jelly becomes ropy. If boiled too hard, so that 
sugar crystallizes on the sides of the kettle, which is stirred in afterwards, 
the jelly may candy. In making jelly from fruit to which water has been 
added, as crab apple, it is measured, and three-quarters the amount of 
sugar put to heat. When put i:: the kettle, the depth of juice is measured 
with a stick, on which are two notches, one for the original depth, and 
one for two-thirds the amount. As soon as the juice has boiled down 
one-third add the warmed sugar, and boil. 



146 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Apple Jelly.— We like Fall Pippins for this purpose, but Gravenstein 
or any other highly-flavored apple, nearly ripe, makes a fine jelly. The 
jelly is excellent without any additional flavoring, but we prefer to add 
Rose geranium leaves, which render it delicious; four leaves to a quart 
of jelly. The leaves are put in with the sugar, and taken out when the 
jelly is put in glasses. Another variation is made by using three whole 
cloves to a quart of jelly; this imitates the nutmeg jelly made in Trinidad, 
the spiciuess being so faint that it does not overpower the fruit flavor. 
To prepare apples for jelly, wipe them with a damp cloth, remove the 
stem and blossom ends and cut in quarters. Put in granite or porcelain- 
lined preserve kettle, and for three pounds of apples add one pint of 
water. Cover and cook slowly until apples are soft; mash, then drain 
through a coarse sieve. Do not squeeze, or jelly will be cloudy. Next 
allow juice to drip through a double thickness of cheesecloth or flannel 
jelly bag. Or they may be turned directly into jelly bag and allowed to 
drip over night. Measure juice, boil 20 minutes, and add an equal quan- 
tity of heated granulated sugar, boil five minutes, skim and turn into 
glasses that have been dipped into scalding water an'd placed on a wet 
cloth. Put a silver spoon in the tumbler before turning the jelly in as 
another means of avoiding cracking the glass ; it can be moved from 
tumbler to tumbler as you proceed. Fill brimming full, as the jelly will 
shrink as it cools. The glasses may now be placed in a sunny window, 
protected from dust, and let stand for 24 hours. Cover with melted 
paraffin, poured directly on to the jelly; then seal as usual. 

Apple Combination. — A housewife who has tried it says that a deli- 
cious combination jelly is made by cooking a half peck each of apples 
and quinces and a quart of cranberries together until soft, after barely 
covering with water. Strain, and to every pint of juice allow a scant pint 
of sugar, then proceed as with other jellies. It is delicately flavored, and 
a beautiful pink in color. 

Barberry Jelly. — For domestic use the berries should not be gathered 
until well frosted. For jelly the fruit need not be stripped from the stems. 
Put the fruit in a porcelain kettle with water to come to the top of the 
berries and boil until thoroughly cooked, then put into, a jelly bag and 
drain out the juice; return the juice to the kettle and boil hard 15 minutes. 
Measure it before boiling down. Add a pound of sugar to each pint and 
boil rapidly 10 minutes, then put away in glasses. This is an excellent 
jelly to serve with meat. 

Blackberry Jelly. — Make the same as currant jelly. 

Crab-apple Jelly. — Wash, cut in pieces two gallons of crab apples; 
place in the preserving kettle, just cover with cold water and cook until 
the pieces are tender. Drain through cheesecloth, measure, and when 
the juice has boiled 10 minutes, stir in one pound white sugar to each 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 147 

pint of juice. Boil hard until it is jelly; about 10 minutes' boiling after 
the sugar has been added. Now take the tender pieces left after straining, 
rub through a sieve or colander; to each pint of pulp add one-half as 
much sugar. Cook nntil the sugar is thoroughly blended with the pulp, 
stirring quite frequently. Add spices if preferred, fill into glass cans, seal, 
and take to the cellar when cool. This makes a delicious butter, almost 
a marmalade, and is very nice in the Winter with pork. Two gallons of 
crab apples will make six glasses of jelly and five or six quarts of butter 
with the addition of 11 pounds of sugar. Crab apple will mix well with 
wild grapes for jelly. The two fruits should be cooked together, and 
made like any other jelly. The proportion may be whatever is most 
convenient; half and half, or one-third grapes to two-thirds apples, will 
be found excellent. 

Wild Crab-apple Jelly. — ^Cook the cored crabs till tender and drip in a 
jelly bag. Use more sugar than for ordinary jelly — about five cups of 
sugar to four of juice — and cook quickly. This is delicious both in 
color and flavor. 

Mrs. C.'s Currant Jelly. — ^The currants are picked over as if for 
canning, then put in the preserving kettle. As the fruit heats, it is mashed 
with a large spoon until juice is pretty nearly all extracted. The juice 
is all dipped off and her jelly is made according to 1;he common recipe. 
She now adds to the currants left in kettle an equal amount of raspber- 
ries — either black or red is added, and jam is made by the addition of 
three-fourths of a pound of granulated sugar to each pound of fruit. 
In this way she says jelly making is an easy task, and she also has the 
consciousness of having used every bit of the currants. 

Elderberry Jelly. — Strip the ripe berries into the kettle and stir over 
the fire with a wooden spoon until the juice flows freely; turn into a 
jelly bag and let drain without touching so as not to become cloudy. 
Weigh and boil sharply 15 minutes. Remove from fire and add sugar, 
allowing 14 ounces to one pint of juice. Boil 15 minutes, stirring and 
skimming until it jellies. This is an English recipe and a very good one. 

Elderberry Jelly No. 2. — Take equal parts of elderberries and wild 
grapes, and cook to extract juice, strain, add sugar in proportion of one 
pound to each pint of liquid, and cook as other jelly. This is especially 
nice for invalids, and beneficial in cases of sore throat. 

Grape Jelly. — The wild grapes gathered just as they begin to turn are 
the best for jelly. Free them from their stems and wash them, mash 
them, and heat slowly; cook them until the juice is well drawn out; turn 
into a flannel bag and let it drip without pressure ; measure the juice, and, 
if cultivated grapes are used, allow an equal amount of sugar; if the wild 
grape, allow a little more than an equal measure. Heat the sugar (put in 
a pan in the oven and. stir often) ; boil the^strained juice 15 minutes; skim 



148 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

and strain again, add the sugar, boil until the surface looks wrinkled, skim 
well and turn into glasses. 

Green Grape Jelly.— Select the grapes when full grown, just before 
they begin to turn purple. After separating from tl^e stem, wash, adding 
a; little water if the grapes are not very juicy. Mash and stew until the 
skins are cooked. Strain first through the colander, then through the jelly 
bag. Measure the juice, measure the same amount of sugar, putting it in 
the oven while the juice is being boiled. The boiling will take half an 
hour. Now add the hot sugar, which you must be careful not to scorch, 
boil about five minutes longer, and then the jelly should be ready to pour 
in glasses. Jelly made from the green grapes is solid, of a delicious flavor 
aiid of a pretty green tint. 

Spiced Grape Jelly. — This is delicious served with cold meats. Take 
equal amounts of grape juice and sugar. Add one-half teaspoonful of 
ground cloves and one tablespoonful of cinnamon to each quart of juice. 
Add the sugar as directed in recipe above. 

Marble Jelly. — A dark jelly, such as blackberry or grape, is poured into 
a half-gallon crock; as soon as this hardens a light jelly, apple, quin.:e or 
pear, is poured on top ; so on in alternate layers until the crock is filled. 
The layers look prettiest when but an inch thick. Slice in half-inch slices, 
serve on a pretty ^lass. dish. Besides being unique in appearance the 
blending of flavors is decidedly appetizing. 

Peach Jelly. — Take sound, high-flavored, barely ripe peaches. Wash 
them thoroughly. Use the parings and a few pieces of fruit. Boil in 
enough water to cover in an enameled kettle until the skins are tender 
and broken. Strain through a jelly bag. Allow the juice of one lemon 
arid one scant pound of sugar to each pint of juice. Boil the juice twenty 
minutes after straining, and meantime heat the sugar in the oven. Put 
the sugar into the juice slowly, let boil five minutes and pour into tumblers. 

Peach Jelly No. 3. — Take the peach parings from a peck or two of 
peaches and simmer with sour apples till the whole mass is tender. Have 
twice the quantity of peach that you have of apple and make your jelly 
in the ordinary way. 

Pear Jelly. — Select juicy pears that are not top ripe, quarter, core and 
cut in small pieces without paring. Put in a kettle with one pint of 
water to every four pounds of pears. Cook over a slow fire to a pulp, 
turn into a jelly bag which has been wrung out, and let drip without 
squeezing. Measure the juice and allow the same quantity of suga'r. Put 
.the liquid over the fire, bring to the boiling point and boil 20 minutes. In 
the meantime heat the sugar by spreading it out on pans and setting it in 
an open oven; when the pear juice has boiled twenty minutes add the 
heated sugar, stir until it is dissolved, bring again to the boiling point, 
and boil until in dropping a spoonful on a cold saucer a skin forms 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 110 

quickly over it ; this will generally occur after five or ten minutes' boiling. 
Take from the fire and pour into jelly glasses. Let stand until cold, pour 
over the top of each glass a little melted paraffin, and when it hardens 
cover. 

Plum Jelly.— Pour boiling water over one-half peck of plums p'.aced 
in a colander. Then put them in a preserving kettle, pour over them just 
enough water to cover and boil until the plums have become soft and 
the juice has flowed out. Drain through a colander, then through a jelly 
bag without squeezing. Measure juice and put to boil in preserve kettle. 
Add one dozen blanched plum kernels. Allow an equal measure of 
granulated sugar and put it to heat in shallow pans in the oven. When 
the juice has boiled 20 minutes skim well, add the hot sugar, stir until 
dissolved, let come to the boiling point, take immediately from the fire 
and fill into glasses which have been rolled in boiling water, drained and 
stood upright on a cloth folded in a shallow pan of boiling water. Use 
a small teacup to dip the jelly into the tumblers, and fill them very full. 
Cover airtight next day. The pulp remaining may be used to make a 
little marmalade, allowing three-quarters of a pint of sugar to one pint 
of pulp, and a few blanched kernels from the plum stones. 

Plum and Green Grape Jelly. — Plums mixed with green grapes make 
the most delicious of all tart jellies. Small yellow plums are the best. 
Wash, pick and scald them with their own bulk of green grapes picked 
from the stem, strain out the juice, let it settle 10 minutes, then pour it 
carefully off the sediment. Put in a shallow kettle over a quick fire, boil 
for five minutes, skimming well ; then add for each pint of juice a pound 
and a quarter of very hot granulated sugar; stir hard until the sugar 
dissolves; then skim again and boil hard for two minutes. Drop a little 
in ice water — the minute this hardens take it off the fire and pour into 
hot glasses. 

Plum and Peach. — ^Japan plums not quite ripe, with a few peaches, 
make a nice clear amber jelly. 

Quince Jelly. — Simmer the quinces in a stone jar till tender in enough 
water to cover them. Drip and strain the juice and boil 20 minutes before 
adding an almost equal amount of sugar. This will be a beautiful color 
if well made and have a delicate flavor. 

Quince Jelly No. 2. — Place the parings and cores left from preserving 
in die preserving kettle, cover with cold water and cook until the parings 
are soft; strain through cheesecloth, measure, and when boiling hard, put 
a pound of white sugar to each pint of the juice. Boil hard until it will 
set. Ten minutes of hard boiling is usually enough; then pour into 
glasses. 

Quince and Cranberry. — Stew cores and skins pf quinces in very little 
water, and strain the juice as for quince jelly; stgw tart cranberries 



]r,o THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

separately in very little water, strain, and combine with an equal propor- 
tion of quince juice. Add to the combined juices one cupful of sugar to 
each cupiul of juice, and boil briskly until it jellies. 

Raspberry Jelly.— One of our friends tells us with pride that she made ' 
delicious stiff raspberry jelly last year by mixing the red raspberries with 
an equal quantity of green grapes. The two fruits were cooked together, 
then strained as usual. The resuhing jelly was clear red, with full rasp- 
berry flavor. Our friend had never been able to make raspberries "jell" 
properly before, so she was much pleased with the experiment. It is 
quite possible that green grapes would stiffen strawberry jelly, which is 
usually difficult to harden. Some experimenters say they mix either 'red 
currants or early apples with strawberries to make jelly. If raspberries 
and Summer apples are available at the same time, a combination of the 
two will make an excellent jelly. Cook and strain separately, then mix 
the juice, and proceed as with any other jelly. Raspberry and red cur- 
rants mixed are excellent. 

Rhubarb Jelly. — On account of the watery consistency of the fruit it 
cannot be made into jelly as readily as most fruit. A fine jelly and one 
specially suitable for serving with game can be made if the following 
directions are observed : Let the rhubarb heat on the back of the stove 
until the juice flows freely. Strain the juice through a jelly bag. Do not 
squeeze the bag into the jelly, but use only what will drip of itself. The 
bag can be squeezed into a different vessel, and the liquid thus gained can 
be re-added to the pulp of the rhubarlj and made into jam. Take the 
rhubarb juice and boil gently for 10 minutes. Measure and to each pint 
allow a pound of granulated sugar. Boil until a little poured out on a 
cold plate will set nicely. Do not measure the juice before it has been 
boiled. Such treatment is needed to reduce the water and make the pure 
juice and sugar jelly properly. If care is taken in the boiling of the 
jelly, it turns out a pretty color and is very desirable for garnishing 
various dishes. 

Rhubarb Jelly No. 2. — 'Cut off the leaves and ends from the stalks, 
and wipe with a clean, damp cloth. Use an earthen dish for cooking. 
Without removing the skins, cut the rhubarb into pieces 2J^ inches long, 
and put over them 1J4 cupful of sugar, a piece" of lemon peel, and a pint 
of water, this proportion to two pounds of rhubarb. Cover and set in 
the oven on a shelf. Moisten a half ounce of white gelatine in a quarter 
of a cupful of cold water. When the rhubarb is tender put the gelatine' 
in a large bowl, on which an earthen colander is placed. Pour the 
rhubarb on this, but remove it very soon to a dish, in order to retain 
sufficient juice with it. Stir the hot liquid underneath, and when the 
gelatine is dissolved pour into teacups or molds dipped in cold water. 

Strawberry Jelly. — To 10 quarts of strawberries a<id two quarts of 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 151 

currants, and proceed as for currant jelly, but boil 15 minutes. Or 
use apple juice instead of currants. 

Tomato Jelly.— Simmer yellow tomatoes without water till pulpy and 
then drip in a bag. Take equal parts of tomato and apple juice and 
proceed in the ordinary way. 

Watermelon Jelly.— Mash the heart of a dead-ripe melon and strain 
the juice so obtained. Boil to a thick syrup with equal parts of granu- 
lated sugar and add to apple juice; then proceed as for' apple jelly. 

We always pour melted paraffin over the top of our jelly before 
putting the cover on. Break the paraffin in pieces, put in a cup, and set 
the cup in a pan of warm water on the back of the stove; it will soon 
melt enough to pour. It should be one-fourth inch thick over, the jelly; 
if too thin it cracks. If you have reason to fear mold, cut disks of white 
paper to fit the top of the glass; dip in brandy or grain alcohol, and pour 
the parafiin over this. If the room or closet in which jelly is stored is 
damp, Prof. Conn recommends setting a few lumps of unslaked lime about 
on the shelves, removing when they crumble. 



CANDIED FRUITS. 

Cherries. — Get large, sound cherries and cut off the stem to avoid tear- 
ing the fruit. Wipe with a soft cloth. Weigh the cherries and then 
weigh out an equal amount of fine sugar. Sprinkle a little sugar over the 
cherries and let them stand over night. With the rest of the sugar make a 
thick syrup and let that stand over night. In the morning bring the syrup 
to boiling heat; put the cherries in and boil for five minutes. Let them 
stand together for 24 hours, drain off the syrup and boil long enough to 
get rid of the juice from the cherries (until a thick syrup as it was at 
first) and pour over the cherries. The next morning drain off the syrup 
and boil to candy degree. Dip each cherry in this and put on a sieve, in 
a warm place to dry. When perfectly dry pack in glass, or in boxes with 
waxed paper between layers. 

Oranges. — Peel the oranges and separate the sections without breaking 
the white skin that covers them. Place on plates and keep where it is 
warm until dry. Alakc a syrup with granulated sugar; boil until it will 
thread and then add two tablespoonfuls of vinegar for each pound of 
sugar used. Boil until it begins to turn straw-colored. The instant this 
change of color shows lift the pan and set it in a pan of boiling water. 
Now take the sections of orange on a greased fork; dip them carefully 
m the syrup, and drop on waxed paper to dry. Lay the orange on the 
fork, never stick the fork through the skin. If the syrup begins to harden 
it may be heated again. Don't stir the syrup at any stage of the work. 



153 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

and when dipping the orange dc it gently, or the syrup will be spoiled, and 
for this reason it is not advisable to use more than a pound of sugar at 
one time. 

Peaches. — Pare and halve enough large peaches to weigh two pounds. 
Make a syrup with one-half a pound of sugar and a cup of water by 
boiling together for five minutes. Drop the fruit in and cook gently utiti! 
tender, then drain out and spread on plates. Boil the syrup until faMy 
thick and pour over the fruit. Place the plates in a warm oven; turn, the 
fruit over frequently until dry. Roll each piece in granulated sugar and 
put in hot sunshine. Let stand in sun an hour or two. When cooled 
pack in layers between waxed paper. 

Pineapple. — Get the finest fruit to be had ; pare and cut into the thin- 
nest possible slices. Weigh, and allow a pound of sugar to each pound of 
fruit. Spread sliced fruit on platters and sprinkle the sugar ovel- it. Keep 
in a warm place for a week — or until dr}- — then put in a hot oven for 10 
minutes. When cold, pack between waxed papers. 

Quinces. — Boil fruit until tender in as little water as possible (may 
be steamed) and put through a sieve. Weigh the sifted fruit and to each 
pound of fruit allow a pound of sugar. Put fruit and sugar together 
and boil until very thick. Spread on plates ; dry in oven or sun ; cut in 
bars; roll in sugar; dry again, and pack like the others described, or wrap 
each bar in waxed paper. Tin boxes are fine for packing away these 
fruits, but small tin pails will serve the purpose equally well. Glass cans 
are good so far as keeping quality goes, but are not so easy to use. 

CANNING VEGETABLES. 

Vegetables for canning should be fresh gathered, and of the highest 
quality, just in the right condition for eating. 

Asparagus. — Straight-sided quart glass jars, such as the "Royal," should 
be used for asparagus, so as to avoid breaking the stalks. Wash care- 
fully, cut the right length to stand the whole stalk upright in the jar 
and pack in snugly, heads up ; then pour in cold water slowly, until the 
jar is full to overflowing, and lay on the tops. Place straw or boards in 
the bottom of the wash-boiler, stand the jars on this, and pour in enough 
cold water to come half way up the jars; put the boiler over the fire, and 
when the v/ater comes to a boil, boil steadily for three hours. Take up 
the jars, see that they are iu\l to overflowing (if not fill up with boiling 
water) put on rubbers and screw or otherwise fasten the covers tight 
Keep in a cool, dark place. Another recipe recommends boiling the 
asparagus for 15 minutes, then putting in the jar, and boiling in the 
wash-boiler for V/i hour, but we think some of the stalks are very 
likely to be broken by this method. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 153 

Beans.— String beans are cut in lengths, boiled for 10 minutes, then 
put into cans, which are stood in a kettle of water and boiled for two 
hours. Add a teaspoonful of sa'.t, fill the jar to overflowing with boiling 
water, screw up, and keep in a cool dark place. Another plan is as 
follows : Wash and break each pod in two or three pieces, put on the 
stQve in a saucepan of cold salt water and when it just commences to 
bubble (don't let it boil) drain the beans out and put in cans that have 
been washed and scalded. Have ready another saucepan of boiling salt 
water and fill the cans nearly to the brim, leaving just room enough for 
one tablespoonful of hot vinegar, screw on the caps and set away. When 
wanted for use pour off the brine and put in a saucepan of fresh water 
with a pinch of soda added ; let them come to a boil and immediately 
paur off the water, then cook as you would fresh beans. 

Dried String Beans. — When fit for the table pick and prepare them 
by removing the strings and breaking up into inch pieces ; put into a 
kettle of cold water and then bring to a scalding heat. Skim out, spread 
on plates and dry in the oven or out of doors until all moisture is 
removed. Put away in bags until snow flies, then take out a quart and 
soak in cold water over night. Next morning boil with a good-sized 
piece of sweet salt pork until tender. 

Beets. — Young beets are delicious canned ; cook until tender in salted 
water the same as for table use. Cut in thin slices, fill the cans and cover 
v.'ith hot vinegar, sweetened and spiced, seal. 

Cauliflower. — Cauliflower may be canned either in vinegar or water. 
Break into flowerets and cook until tender in a small quantity of water, 
pack the cans as full as possible, add the salt, and fill to overflowing with 
hot liquor in which it was cooked, seal. When vinegar is used, steam the 
cauliflower until tender, fill into cans and pour over hot vinegar, sweet- 
ened and spiced. 

Corn. — For canned corn cut the kernels off the cob with a sharp 
knife, scraping out the pulp. Fill into the can a little at a time, pressing 
it down firmly until the milk overflows the can. Add a teaspoonful of 
salt. When all are filled place the cans in a boiler and cook half an 
hour with the covers laid loosely on. Remove from the jire and seal, 
then cook two hours longer. The preliminary cooking permits the corn 
to swell without endangering the cans, which may burst if tightly sealed 
from the first. Succotash is canned by first half filling the cans with 
green Lima beans, then filling the remainder of the can with corn, 
pressed down firmly. Add a teaspoonful of salt to each can, and cook 
like corn. 

Salted Corn.— This recipe has been highly endorsed by readers who 
Jmve tried it. Have corn "just right" for eating. While it may be 
brought from the field the previous evening it should not be prepared 



154 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

otherwise until the following mornin.o-. as there is danger of its souring. 
Clean and scald your boiler thoroughly and fill with the corn properly, 
husked and silked, discarding all ears either over or under ripe. Cook 
as for the table. Removing from the boiler, score each row' of kernels 
with a sharp knife and shave off not too close to the cob. After cutting 
from cob, measure and to each eight pints of corn add one pint of salt 
and mix thoroughly with the hands until a brine is formed. Have ready 
a well-scalded and clean crock and pack corn in this as it is mixed. 
When jar is filled within one inch of top, cover with a clean white cloth 
large enough to hang over edge of crock. Ott this cloth put about an 
inch of salt, and on the salt a plate that fits the top of jar. Now it is 
ready to put in the cellar or any cool place for Fall and Winter use, but 
in its preparation for the table lies the secret of its success. There is 
only one way of making it palatable, but with directions strictly adhered 
to it is preferred by many to canned corn. About one and one-half hour 
before the meal at which one wishes to serve it it must be brought from 
the cellar — enough for one meal — and cold water enough to cover poured 
on and at once poured off. Then sufficient boiling water is poured on to 
cover and it is allowed to stand on the back of the range for 15 minutes. 
This water is drained off and sufficient fresh boiling water poured on to 
cover and the same time allowed. This process is repeated twice more, 
in all four times. Then cream, butter, sugar and if liked a little pepper 
is added. In short after pouring off the water for the fourth time it is 
prepared exactly as canned corn. The process of removing the salt by a 
swift boiling water process instead of a slow cold water process seems 
to leave the corn as fresh as when taken from the cob. This, together 
with the ease with which it is prepared — so much easier and surer than 
canning — makes the process ideal. 

Southern Dried Corn. — Sew firmly into a quilting-frame a strong 
sheet. Gather the corn when ready for use, husk and remove silk. Put 
on in boiler, cover with water and when it starts boiling let cook well 
for 10 or 15 minutes. Take off, allow it to cOol some, then score and cut 
off, but not too close, to have it shucky, and scrape off what remains on 
ear. Have your frame out in a sunny place, spread corn evenly upon it, 
cover with a mosquito netting and it will dry quickly in this way, as it 
dries from below just as fast as above. Then at some convenient time 
when the oven is piping hot put it in the oven to heat well through in 
order to kill any chance "microbe." When it comes time to cook the 
dried corn wash well in water. Put to soak in milk over night and cook 
in the milk it soaked in; season with sugar, salt, pepper and butter, and 
you will find it very good and know that it is clean. 

Uncooked Canned Corn. — Prepare corn by removing husks and silk; 
break into pieces large enough to fit into two-quart cans. Season cold 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 155 

water with just enough salt to taste. Then fill the cans up with this 
salt water; have new rubbers for cans, and when you have got the air 
bubbles all out seal your cans and stand them upside down to see that 
they do not leak. If they do not your corn will keep all right. Some 
cut it off and can same way, but always fill the can first and then put 
in the salt water. We are told that this corn keeps perfectly. 

Peas. — To can peas, fill the jars full of peas, uncooked; then fill 
with cold water, and lay on the tops. Place straw or boards in the 
bottom of the wash boiler, stand the jars on this, and pour enough cold 
water in the boiler to come half way up the. jars. Put the boiler on the 
stove with the lid tightly closed, and boil three hours. When the jars 
are taken out, see that they are full to overflowing, and screw the lid 
on tight. Another method of preparing peas is to cook five minutes 
in very little water, then fill the cans, and place them in the boiler to 
cook for one hour. A teaspoonful of salt is added the last thing before 
sealing. 

Dried Peas. — Green peas are dried as follows: Shell the peas, put 
them in boiling water, and boil for five minutes. Drain, then spread out 
in shallow trays, and dr\- in the sun, or near the stove. When dry, store 
away in paper bags, in a dry place. The peas should be soaked before 
using;. then boiled in salted water. 

Tomatoes. — Scald to remove the skins, put in the jars whole or halved, 
fill up with cold water; stand the jars in the wash boiler, boil 30 minutes, 
and seal. Do not use any overripe or fermenting fruit. The main things 
to observe in canning vegetables are that the jars are filled to overflow- 
ing; that they are hermetically sealed, while hot, and that they are stored 
in a cool, dry place. Vegetables, like fruits, should be taken in their 
regular order and canned while in the best possible condition. 

Tomatoes Canned Whole. — Select firm, smooth fruit, not overripe, 
and of a size to slip into the ordinary fruit jar. Peel without breaking 
and with as little scalding as possible. Have ready a preserving kettle 
full of water, which has been salted slightly, only enough to taste. Just 
before the water reaches the boiling point drop the tomatoes into it, one 
layer at a time and heat through. Do not allow the water to boil at 
any time. When thoroughly heated transfer tomatoes to the cans, being 
careful not to bruise them. Fill the cans with the hot, salted water, and 
screw the tops on quickly. Turn the cans over in a deep kettle of hot 
water until the rubbers are heated and set, .which hermetically seals the 
cans. In using drain from the salt water, and serve exactly as fresh 
tomatoes. 



CHAPTER XII. 

PICKLES AND RELISHES. 

Amber Pickles. — Clicose small yellow pear tomatoes when just turn- 
ing to ripen. Prick each tomato with a needle three times to prevent 
bursting in cooking, and soak half an hour in salted water. Take out 
and put in jars, after which jnake a syrup of one pint of vinegar, three- 
quarters of a pound of C sugar and a pinch of salt, and put to boil in 
a porcelain kettle. Take one-half dozen cloves, same of whole allspice, 
one peppercorn, a piece of cir.namon, a splinter of mace and a chip of 
ginger root; tie all in a cheesecloth bag and boil ten minutes in the 
syrup. Remove spice bag and put the tomatoes in the kettle until they 
are heated through (do not let boil), take out with skimmer and put 
in jars. Boil syrup 20 minutes longer and pour hot over tomatoes. Next 
day pour off syrup, reheat and pour over tomatoes, and seal in jars. 

Apple Pickle. — Eighteen good sharp apples ; one-quarter pound best 
ginger ; one pound Sultana raisins ; one ounce mustard seed ; six shallots ; 
one-quarter pound salt; V/i pound moist sugar; six good-sized onions; 
one-half ounce small chilli peppers ; one-half teaspoon cayenne pepper. 
Three pints white wine vinegar. Pare and quarter apples and place in a 
double boiler, cover tightly to keep in steam, cook till quite soft ; chop 
onions and shallots, and boil in vinegar until they are soft also. Then 
mix ingredients together, and place in an iron saucepan, no other metal 
will do. Roil for three-quarters of an hour, stirring faithfully, as it 
burns very quickly. Put down in small pots well sealed. This pick'e 
will remain good for years. It should stand two months before using. 

Sweet Apple Pickle. — Three pounds of sugar to seven of cored 
apples, and one pint of vinegar. Steam the apples till tender, but not 
too much ; stick a clove or two in every quarter. Make a syrup of the 
sugar and vinegar and pour while hot over the apples. May be kept in 
a well-covered jar in a cool place, and keep well. 

String Beans. — Cut the ends off the tiny pods and remove the little _ 
beginnings of "strings," pack in glass jars, and pour in the boiling spiced 
and sweetened vinegar just as if making sweet pickled pears or peaches; 
If white wine vinegar is used the beans will retain their vivid green 
color and thus make a pretty as well as a delicious relish. 

Beets, Canned. — Select small, dark-red beets, about the size of a 
peach or smaller, boil in the usual way, being careful not to break the 
skins in washing; do not cut the tops too close and be sure not to cut 
the ends off. Boil in salted water until tender, but not too soft. Rub 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 157 

the skins off as soon as they are cool enough to handle, also cut off 
top and tail and pack in fruit jars; set aside and prepare your vinegar. 
It will not be necessary to heat the beets over again. Put as much 
vinegar over the fire as will be required to cover the beets; when this 
comes to a boil add a little sugar, according to taste. Let the vinegar 
boil five minutes longer; pour over the beets piping hot and seal. A 
small piece of horseradish put into each jar will keep the white scum 
from forming on the top of the vinegar. 

Beet Relish. — Boil two medium-sized beets until tender, drain and 
let stand in cold water three minutes, then skin, slice thin and cover with 
strong vinegar for one hour. Drain off the vinegar and mash the beets 
thoroughly, adding three tablespoons of grated horseradish, a pinch of 
salt and a dash of black pepper. 

Beet Sweet Pickle. — ■Boil till tender, then skin, and cut into slices or 
strips. Put in glass jars rather loosely, so that each piece will be sur- 
rounded by the pickle. To two quarts of vinegar add four pounds of 
brown sugar, and, when these are in the kettle, add a scant half-teaspoon- 
ful of pulverized alum. Use a porcelain-lined kettle for this liquid, and 
bring the contents to a boil. Skim carefully, and then add to it a small 
cheesecloth bag containing a teaspoonful each of whole peppercorns, 
allspice and cloves. Boil again, and add a little cayenne pepper and salt. 
Fill the jars to overflowing with this liquid, and set aside over night. The 
next morning drain the beets, and bring the syrup again to a hard boil. 
Pour this again into the jars of beets, doing so while it is scalding hot, 
and filling each jar to overflowing. Seal immediately. 

Blackberry Pickle. — Put a pint of the best cider vinegar in a granite 
kettle, together with four cupfuls of granulated sugar, one teaspoonful 
of ground cloves, and two teaspoonfuls of ground cinnamon ; when it 
boils add three quarts of dewberries or blackberries that have been care- 
fully cleaned; let the fruit cock 10 minutes in the syrup, then skim the 
berries into a gallon jar ; pour over the syrup and turn a plate over them 
to keep the berries below the surface ; tie a double fold of cloth and 
thick paper over the jar when the fruit is cold and the pickle will 
keep perfectly. 

Cauliflower Pickles. — Two cauliflowers, broken up, one pint small 
onions, three medium-sized red peppers ; dissolve half a pint of salt in 
water sufficient to cover the vegetables, and let stand over night; drain 
in the morning; steam the vegetables until tender; heat two quarts of 
vinegar with three level tablespoonfuls of mustard (less if preferred) 
until it boils; pour over vegetables; bottle and seal. 

Pickled Cherries.— Five pounds of cherries, stoned or not, as pre- 
ferred; one quart of vinegar, two pounds of sugar, one-half ounce of 
cinnamon, one-half ounce of cloves, same amount of mace, all ground. 



158 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Boil the sugar, vinegar and spices (tie the latter in a bag) together, and 
pour hot over the cherries. 

Spiced Cherries.— Make a syrup by boiling together four pounds of 
granulated sugar, one pint of vinegar, one-half ounce each of cinnamon 
bark and whole cloves. Cook in this till the skin breaks nine pounds 
of firm, ripe cherries. 

Chopped Pickle.— One-half peck green tomatoes, two stalks of celery, 
one green pepper, one-half a cabbage, three. large onions, all chopped, to 
which add one-half a cupful of mustard seed, two tablespoonfuls of 
celery seed, one-half cupful of brown sugar, one-quarter cupful of salt, 
one teaspoonful of black pepper, the same of cinnamon, one saltspoonful 
each of cloves and allspice and one quart of vinegar. Mix all well to- 
gether and seal in Mason jars. Will keep perfectly. 

Chow Chow, — Wash thoroughly and chop without paring half a 
peck of green tomatoes ; chop fine one large head of white cabbage ; pare 
and chop six large cucumbers; clean thoroughly and cut into small dice 
one bunch of celery and finely chop one large white onion. Mix all 
together, add half a cup of salt and let stand over night. Clean 100 
tiny pickles and fifty small silver-skinned onions; put into separate jars, 
cover with strong salt water and let them stand over night. The next 
morning drain the first mixture thoroughly, wash off the pickles and 
onions and wipe dry. Chop fine one large red mango pepper. Put all 
together into a preserving kettle, add two quarts of the best cider 
vinegar (dilute somewhat if very strong), half a pound of granulated 
sugar, half an ounce each of turmeric and celery seed, one ounce of 
ground mustard seed. Cook 30 minutes, then bottle and seal. 

English Chow Chow. — This calls for two medium-sized heads of 
firm white cabbage, half a peck of green tomatoes, two quarts of firm 
ripe tomatoes, half a dozen green peppers and two red peppers. Chop 
all together as fine as you can, and pack the mixture in layers of salt. 
Put it in a coarse bag of burlap or some rough material. Lay it over a 
rack placed upon a deep keg or jar and put a heavy press upon it. Let it 
drain in this way over night, or for 24 hours. A pint and a half of 
sugar, half a cup of grated horseradish, half a teaspoonful of ground 
black pepper, half an even teaspoonful of ground mustard, an ounce of 
white mustard seed, an ounce of celery seed, a tablespoonful of ground 
mace and, finally, a gill of Dutch mustard compose the seasonings and 
must be added to the mixture. After it has drained sufficiently moisten 
the whole with enough good cider vinegar scantily to cover it. This 
chow chow requires no cooking and does not have to be put up in sealed 
jars. A stone crock is all sufficient, if kept in a cold, dry place. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 159 

Vifginia Chow Chow. — This is an old recipe. One peck each of 
green and ripe tomatoes, one large, firm head of cabbage, six each of 
green and ripe peppers, six large white onions and two bunches of 
celery. Chop the vegetables fine, sprinkle over them a cupful of coarse 
salt and let them soak 24 hours. Drain all the liquid off, cover with 
best cider vinegar, stir in one pound of dark brown sugar, one-half 
cupful of grated horse-radish, two tablespoonfuls of white mustard 
seed, one tablespoonful of ground ginger, one teaspoonful of ground 
cloves and the same amount of allspice. Let the pickle come slowly 
to the boiling point, then remove to the back of the range and let it 
stand for one hour. Seal up in Mason jars, and it will be ready for 
use in a week, but will improve with age. 

Corn and Cabbage. — Cut the kernels from 12 large ears of corn, add 
as much chopped cabbage as there is cut corn, one large sweet pepper 
freed from seeds and chopped, one cupful of brown sugar, two table- 
spoonfuls of salt, one-half tablespoonful of ground mustard and one 
quart of vinegar. Bring all to a boil and then can. 

Corn Relish. — Chop one head of cabbage; sprinkle over it two table- 
spoonfuls of salt and let stand over night. Cut the kernels from ]3 
ears of corn; chop three peppers. Mix all together. Mix with them a 
little celery seed; grated horseradish, or both if liked, though neither 
are needed to insure the keeping qualities of the relish. Bring two 
quarts of vinegar to boiling heat; add one cup of sugar and a quarter 
of a pound of mustard that has been rubbed smooth in a little cold 
vinegar. Pour this hot dressing over the mixture; stir until well 
mixed; put in glass jars, or small jars. 

Corn Salad.— Eighteen large ears corn, one head cabbage, one-fourth 
pound ground mustard, four red peppers (chopped), one-half cup salt, 
one and two-thirds cup sugar, two quarts vinegar. Corn is shaved from 
cob, cabbage and peppers chopped and all ingredients thoroughly mixed. 
It is then cooked one hour. By cooking in oven It need not be stirred 
so frequently and there is much less danger of burning. It is canned 
and sealed while hot. 

Pickled Crab Apple.— One quart of vinegar, three pounds brown 
sugar; make this into a syrup. Have the apples in a gallon jar or one 
of size that will set in an iron kettle. Pour this syrup over them, have 
seasoning tied in small pieces of cheese cloth and cook with the rest. 
Boil in the jar until a fork will go easily into the apples. The juice 
need not cover the fruit at first, the apples help make more. This 
keeps the fruit whole and is very satisfactory; it needs a weight like a 
small plate to keep apples under the liquor. 

Cucumbers in Barrels.— Choose small cucumbers free from spots. 
Put a layer of cucumbers in the bottom of a cask, then a layer of coarse 



160 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

salt, about one-fourth inch thick, then another layer of cucumbers, more 
salt, and so on until all are used. Place a board on top of the pickles, 
with a heavy stone to keep them down. Then pour in about a quart of 
water to moisten the salt, which, with the juice exuding from the cu- 
cumbers should make sufficient brine to cover. Continue to add cu- 
cumbers, as they are gathered, in layers as before; a few cabbage or 
horseradish leaves on top, under the board, will prevent molding. When 
the cask is full, tuck a cloth closely around the edges, put board -and 
weight on top, and cover closely, and the cucumbers will keep for a 
year or two. When cucumbers are wanted for pickling, remove cloth, 
board and stone, and wash them well in warm water ; wipe all scum 
from 'sides' of cask with a clean cloth, take out cucumbers, and then 
cover any remaining as before. Soak cucumbers for three days in cold 
water, changing water each day; drain and wipe carefully. Half fill a 
large porcelain-lined preserving kettle with good cider vinegar, put in 
as many cucumbers as the vinegar will cover, with a piece of alum the 
size of a hazelnut; heat to boiling point, stirring with a wooden spijon 
so that they do not soften at bottom of kettle, and then drain, throw- 
ing away the vinegar. Cover with fresh cold vinegar, spice if desired. 
A little chopped horseradish at top will prevent molding. They will 
be ready for use in about a week. A great many cucumber pickles are 
sold direct from the brine. 

Brine for Cucumbers. — To six parts of water use one part salt, and 
one part of cider vinegar. Keep the pickles well under the brine, and 
they will keep longer and be more brittle than when laid down in salt. 
In the o!d way. 

Pickle for Cucumbers. — One-half ounce of black pepper, one and 
One-half ounce of ginger, one ounce of allspice, one ounce of cloves, 
one ounce of mustard seed, three-fourths of a pound of salt, half a tea- 
spoon cayenne pepper, one ounce ground mustard, one ounce turmeric, 
and six quarts of vinegar. The spices are to be scalded in the vinegar, 
except the mustard and turmeric which should be added when the 
vinegar is cold. For a good pickle without mustard : Put a teacupful' 
of salt and a tablespoonful of powdered alum into a gallon of vinegar. 
Pick small cucumbers and pour a weak brine over them, boiling hot. 
Let stand over night; drain, and put into prepared vinegar. Add cu- 
cumbers as convenient, and when as many have been put into the vinegar 
as it will cover scald them up, and put into fresh vinegar, to which has 
been added a little red pepper and horseradish. 

Canned Cucumbers. — Cucumbers canned as follows will keep until 
the following June, and are excellent to serve with meat or salad: 
Peel and slice thin medium-sized cucumbers, sprinkle with salt and a 
little alum; let stand two hours; drain and put in jars, adding vinegar 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 16i 

enough to cover, pepper and a few whole mustard seeds, the quantity of 
pepper to be governed by the taste, and the whole pepper to be used 
in preference to the ground. On top of the jar, when ready for seal- 
ing, add a dessertspoonful of olive oil. 

Chopped Cucumber Relish.— This is simple and very excellent. Pare 
and chop fine half a peck of medium-sized cucumbers; chop two medium- 
sized onions. Salt each separately over night, using one-third of a cup 
of salt in all. Drain thoroughly the next morning and mix. If the 
mixture seems too salty cover with cold water and drain a second time. 
Then put into a granite kettle, add a rounding tablespoonful each of 
celery seed and mustard seed, a level tablespoonful of ground mustard, 
one-eighth of a teaspoon of cayenne pepper, half a cup of brown 
sugar and a pint of best vinegar. Boil 10 minutes, then bottle and seal. 
Dill Pickles. — Make a brine strong enough to bear an egg, then add 
half as much more water as you have brine. Wash cucumbers in cold 
water, and into a stone jar put first a layer of cucumbers, then a layer 
of grape leaves and a layer of dill, using leaves and stems. Continue 
in this way until the jar is full. Pour the brine over all and cover, first 
with a cloth, then with a plate, and put a weight on top of the plate. 
The cloth must be washed frequently as in making sauerkraut. 

Gherkins. — Wipe one quart of small unripe cucumbers. Put in a 
stone crock and add one-quarter cupful of salt dissolved in one pint 
of boiling water. Let stand three days. Drain cucumbers from brine, 
bring the brine to the boiling point, pour over the cucumbers, and again 
let stand three days. Repeat; drain, wipe cucumbers, and pour over 
one quart of boiling water in which one scant teaspoonful of alum has 
been dissolved. Let stand six hours, then drain from alum water. 
Cook cucumbers 10 minutes, a few at a time, in one-fourth of the fol- 
lowing mixture, heated to the boiling point and boiled 10 minutes : One 
quart of vinegar, one red pepper, one-half stick of cinnamon, one-half 
teaspoonful allspice, one-half tablespoonful of cloves. Strain the re- 
maining liquor over the pickles, which have been put in a stone jar. 
Bring liquor to boiling point before turning it over the pickles. 

Grated Cucumber Pickles. — Take cucumbers fully grown, pare them, 
and if the seeds are large remove them, then grate and drain through 
a colander, and to the pulp left add as much vinegar as there is juice, 
and can. 

Cucumber Mustard Pickles. — To every gallon of water add two pints 
of fine salt, heat scalding hot and pour over the cucumbers. Let stand 
24 hours, pour off the brine. Heat sufficient vinegar to cover them. 
To every gallon of vinegar add one tablespoonful pulverized alum, pour 
over the cucumbers and cover tight to steam. Put on fresh cabbage 



162 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

J:;aves every other day for a week; heat the vinegar again, put back on 
I iicurabers and let stand two or three days. Then take fresh vinegar; 
10 every gallon put one teaspoonful of red pepper, one of black pepper, 
one ounce cinnamon sticks, two ounces white mustard seed, one small 
piece ginger root, a small handful of horseradish root, one teaspoonful 
of cloves. Boil the spices in a bag, then pour over pickles. These will 
keep crisp and nice indefinitely if kept under the vinegar, or may be 
bottled and sealed if preferred. 

Oiled Cucumber Pickles.— Pare and slice the cucumbers as for serving. 
For 50 medium-sized ones (these are best, because the seeds are not 
large) make a dressing of one cupful of olive oil, half a cupful of white 
mustard seed, half a cupful of black mustard seed, one tablespoonful 
of celery seed and one quart of vinegar. No cooking is required. Sprin- 
kle the sliced cucumbers with salt, and let them stand over night. In 
the morning drain them thoroughly and cover with the dressing in a 
stone jar. A pint of onions sliced thin may be added. It so, the onions 
should be arranged in alternate layers with the sliced cucumbers and 
salt. Place a weight over the top, let the mixture stand over night, 
and drain as before. 

Quick Pickles. — Gather small cucumbers, wash, and rub off the 
prickles. Pack in a two-quart glass jar, put a tablespoonful of salt on 
top, shaking it down, fill with cold water, put the cover on, and set 
away 24 hours. Then pour off the brine, rinse the cucumbers, and fill 
the jar with cold vinegar. Screw the top on tight, and store in cellar. 
If the vinegar looks white in a few months' time pour a little off the 
top, and fill up with fresh. These pickles are very good, though ex- 
tremely sour. 

Quick Mustard Pickles. — Put a gallon of vinegar and one cupful, 
each, of salt and mustard into a two gallon crock; pick small, quickly 
grown cucumbers ; rub off the black specks, and put into vinegar. In 
a few days the pickles are ready for use. Some people add a cup of 
sugar and one of grated horseradish to the above recipe, but it is a 
matter of taste, as neither is necessary to the keeping quality of the 
pickles. Each time cucumbers are added to those in the crock all should 
be well stirred up from the bottom: It is a good plan to put a quart 
of vinegar with its proper proportion of salt and mustard into a two- 
quart glass can, and fill in cucumbers for immediate use. 

Ripe Cucumber Pickles. — Peel and cut ripe cucumbers in rings, 
sprinkle salt on them and let remain over night. Drain off, and cover 
with hot spiced vinegar. 

Salting Cucumbers for Winter. — Secure a small keg and if you have 
cucumbers in your garden gather every other day. Place a layer of 
coarse salt — ice cream salt — in the bottom of the keg, add a cup of water 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 



163 



and cover with the cucumbers you have gathered and washed; sprinkle 
over salt to cover. Repeat this as you gather cucumbers from day to 
day, not, however, adding any more water, as the salt should make suf- 
ficient brine. If there should not be brine to cover them you may add 
a little, cautiously. There should always be a layer of salf in the bot- 
tom of the keg undissolved. When you have gathered all the cucumbers 
you wish put two or three fresh horseradish leaves on the top, and if 
you wish you may place a stone on the top to keep the cucumbers under 
the brine. When desired to make pickles take from the brine as many 
as you wish into a stone jar and cover them with boiling water; let 
them stand 24 hours; drain and cover again with boiling water; let 
stand till next day. If you desire them very fresh you may repeat this 
the third time. It is not always necessary. Then pour off the water 
and drain well. To every three quarts of cucumbers take one quart of 
best cider vinegar. To each gallon of vinegar take one teaspoonful 
each of whole cloves, allspice, peppercorns, mace, celery seed and two 
teaspoonfuls of mustard seed. Tie these in a little muslin or cheese- 
cloth bag. (The spices, if scattered through the cucumbers, turn them 
dark.) Add to vinegar two pieces of ginger-root an inch long and 
two tiny red pepper pods, same size. Boil vinegar with spices for one 
minute and pour over the cucumbers. If not enough vinegar to cover, 
add more boiling hot to fill jar. These need not be sealed. Place a 
horseradish leaf on the top of jar; are ready for use in a few days. 
Will keep indefinitely. 

Small cucumber pickles are prepared as follows: Wash and wipe; 
place in jar.s,- and cover with boiling brine, strong enough to bear an egg. 
Let stand 24 hours; pour off the brine, wipe, and place in clean jars. 
Cover with hot vinegar, spiced in the proportion of one onion, 12 whole 
cloves, one ounce of mustard seed and three blades of mace to 100 cu- 
cumbers. They will be ready to use in two weeks. 

Sour Cucumber Pickles. — Dissolve one pint of salt in one gallon of 
vinegar; wash the cucumbers and pour over them some boiling water, 
let stand five or ten minutes, then pack closely in cans, 'pour over the 
salted vinegar and seal. The friend who sends this recipe says the 
pickles are very crisp and nice, and will keep as long as you will let 
them. 

Spiced Cucumber Pickles.— Prepar vinegar for pickles as follows: 
One gallon vinegar, four ounces salt, two ounces cloves, two ounces 
cinnamon, one ounce allspice, one ounce ginger root, one ounce yellow 
mustard seed, one ounce celery seed, small piece of alum. Scald all 
together. This will keep for years. Wash the cucumbers and drain 
until dry, then put them into the vinegar at any time after it is cold. 



]C4 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

If the vinegar is very sharp add a little water to it before scalding the 
ingredients together, or the pickles will shrivel. 

Sweet Cucumber Pickles.— Let the cucumbers stand in salt water 
three days. Heat the brine once or twice and pour over them. Drain; 
put in a jar and pour over them hot vinegar with cloves and cinnamon 
in a bag; two-thirds cupful sugar to quart of vinegar; put in plenty 
of horseradish and this will keep sealed or open. Put in a little alum 
to make them brittle. 

Boiled Sweet Cucumber Pickle. — Put cucumbers in cold_ weak brine 
(134 cup salt to one gallon v>'ater) one day and night. Take out, dry 
on cloth. To one gallon vinegar add two cups sugar, nearly one ounce 
mixed spice. Heat these all boiling hot. Put in pickles and let boil 
up once. Put in cans immediately and pour the hot vinegar over them. 
They are nice and sweet, and will keep a long time, till eaten. These 
will not shrivel if you follow directions. One gallon vinegar will cover 
two gallons cucumbers. 

Steamed Sweet Cucumber Pickle. — Peel, steam as soft as liked and 
let stand over night in a weak bririe. Next morning drain, put on 
vinegar enough to cover, and let stand over night. Again in the morn- 
ing drain off the liquid part. Now take one pint of fresh vinegar, three 
pounds of sugar and one ci;nce of cassia buds (no other spices). When 
this comes to the boiling point put in the cucumbers, let scald up and then 
pack away in stone jars. 

Tested Cucumber Pickles. — Wash and fill two-quart can with freshly 
picked cucumbers of any desired size. Add to them two heaping table- 
spoonfuls dry mustard ; two heaping tablespoonfuls salt, and fill can 
with good cold cider vinegar. It doesn't matter whether you have an 
airtight top or not; a cork with cloth tied over, or put in crock. H 
you like more mustard or salt it will do no harm. 

Pickles Without Cooking. — One cupful of sugar, one cupful salt, one 
goodsized root of horseradi.sh, one tablespoonful alum, one tablespoonful 
white mustard seed, one gallon vinegar, mixed spice to taste. Boil the 
above ingredients. Then allow the prepared vinegar to become cold 
before putting in the cucumbers. Use the smallest pickles, as the large 
ones do not always become thoroughly pickled, but for the small ones 
this way of preparing them is excellent. 

Spiced Currants. — Make a syrup of three pounds of sugar, one pint 
of vinegar and water, half and half, two tablespoonfuls of cinnamon, 
one tablespoonful of cloves, half a teaspoonful of salt ; add six pounds 
of washed, stemmed currants and boil half an hour. Seal in jars. 

Pickled Damsons.— -This is a sweet pickle, and very good served 
with mutton or venison. Ingredients required : Three pounds damsons, 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 165 

one quart of vinegar, three pounds moist sugar, one-half ounce cinna- 
mon, three blades of mace, one-quarter ounce allspice. The plums 
should be ripe, but not too much so; the bloom is rubbed off with a 
piece of flannel or a clean cloth, and they are pricked a little with a 
needle. The vinegar, sugar and spices are boiled together for 10 min- 
utes, then strained and poured over the fruit, in a large basin Next 
day the vinegar is boiled again, and again poured over the damsons, 
and on the third day the damsons themselves are simmered in the 
vinegar for exactly five minutes. They should be tied down while hot. 
A quicker method of pickling either plums or damsons is the following: 
Remove the stalks from the fruit ; wipe it and arrange in layers in a 
jar with good brown sugar sprinkled between. Fill up the jars with 
cold vinegar, tie them down and bake in rather a slow oven till the 
plums are tender^ then tie down for use. 

French Mustard. — Take six ounces of salt, four ounces of scraped 
horseradish, one clove of garlic, and two quarts of boiling vinegar ; 
steep these together in a covered vessel for six hours, then strain and 
add mustard to the spiced vinegar sufficient to make it the proper con- 
sistency. These proportions are large; they can be reduced if necessary, 
but the mustard will keep a long time, as it is made with boiling vinegar. 

Gillespie Relish. — Ore peck ripe tomatoes, two cupfuls celery, six 
large onions, seven red peppers. Run the peeled tomatoes and the 
onions through a meat grinder. Chop the celery and the peppers fine. 
Add two ounces of mustard seed and ground cinnamon, one-half cupful' 
of salt, three pints cider viu'^gar and two pounds of light brown sugar. 
Mix and seal. Do not cook. It is claimed that ' this will keep per- 
fectly for five years, and it is very appetizing and universally liked. 

Hebrew Pickle.— For a pint of pickles grate two roots of horse- 
radish. Mix with it two tablespoonfuls of celery seed, three tablespoon- 
fuls of mustard seed, four tablespoonfuls of sugar and one tablespoonful 
of turmeric. Cover the ingredients with scalding hot vinegar. Seal in 
glass jars. Let stand one week before using. 

India Relish. — This recipe calls for gherkins, large cucumbers, small 
onions, cabbage and red peppers. Green nasturtium seeds may be added. 
Cut the vegetables all into small pieces and put the mixture, layer by 
layer, into a stone jar, separating the layers with salt. Sprinkle the top 
well with salt, cover with a plate weighted with a flatiron, stone or 
brick, and let the jar and contents stand for three days. At the end of 
that time drain off the liquid and rinse the vegetables thoroughly in 
cold water. Then cover with fresh cold water and leave for 36 hours. 
In tlie meantime scald three-quarters of a gallon of cider vinegar with 
half a tablespoonful each of celery seed, paprika, cloves, mace, ground 
mustard and horseradish and two tablespoonfuls of curry. Add one 



]66 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

and three-quarters cupful of brown sugar. Turn the vinegar over the 
drained vegetables and cook for a quarter of an hour. Put the relish 
into a stone jar and leave it for two or three days. Then drain off the 
vinegar, scald it and pour it while hot over the vegetables. Let it 
stand until the next day, then fill into small jars, cover closely and 
keep in a cool dark place. 

India Relish No. 2.^This comes from the South. Two pounds of 
citron melon or watermelon rind, two heads of cabbage, white and firm; 
six white onions, one large cupful of sugar, one heaping teaspoonful 
each of ground cinnamon, mace, paprika (Hungarian sweet pepper), 
mustard and powdered alum, one tablespoonful of curry powder, one 
quart of vinegar, two tablespoonfuls of celery seed, one tablespoonful 
of salt. Prepare the melon by cutting off the green rind and scraping 
away the softer inner coating, leaving less than an inch firm and white. 
Cut into thin strips, put into a porcelain-lined kettle, cover with cold 
water and sprinkle a tablespoonful of powdered alum over it. Cover 
closely and cook gently for three hours. Drain well and cover with 
ice water. Change the water twice in four hours, and then wipe the 
melon dry. Cut the cabbage into quarters, cook in boiling water slightly 
salted for fifteen minutes. Let it get perfectly cold. Parboil the 
onions, and allow thern also to. get cold and stiff. Now chop cabbage, 
melons and onions separately and very fine. Mix all together in a large 
crock and pour over them the scalding hot vinegar, in which have been 
boiled for one minute the spices, sugar and celery seed. Leave the 
crock covered 34 hours. Strain off the vinegar, bring it to a boil and 
pour again over the > mixture in the crock. Repeat this for three days 
in succession, after which pack in small jars, cover closely and set away 
to ripen. It will be ready for use. in six weeks, but improves by keeping. 

Pickled Mangoes. — Young musk, or nutmeg melons are needed for 
the purpose. Through a slit in the side of the melon extract all the 
seeds with the fingers without breaking the fruit. In case the patience 
gives out, a plug can be cut out,, saved and replaced, but it is better to 
make only the slit. Keep the melons, in strong brine for three days, 
then drain them and let them remain in pure water for 24 hours. Heat 
slowly in vinegar, in which alum has been dissolved, until the melons are 
green. For a gallon of vinegar a piece of alum half the size of a 
hickorynut will be wanted". The following is the recipe for the stuf- 
fing, given in an old cook book; One handful of horseradish scraped; 
two handfuls of English mustard seed, two teaspoonfuls of chopped 
garlic, one teaspoonful of ground nutmeg and mace, one dozen whole 
peppercorns, one teaspoonful of ground ginger, half a tablespoonful of 
ground mustard, one teaspoonful of sugar, one teaspoonful of celery 
seed and one tablespoonful of olive oil. Fill the greened mangoes 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 167 

through the slit with the mixture. Sew up the slit, or tie the melon 
securely so that it will not open. Pack the mangoes in a big stone jar 
and pour scalding vinegar over them. After two days, drain off the 
vinegar, scald and return it to the jar, and repeat twice at intervals 
of two days. The mangoes will be ready for use in four or five 
months. 

Minced Pickle. — Chop half a peck of green tomatoes, cover them with 
two-thirds of a cupful of salt and let them stand for a day and a 
night. Then scald half a gallon of vinegar with a tablespoonful of 
pepper, a tablespoonful and a half each of ground mustard, allspice, 
cinnamon and cloves and half a cupful of white mustard seed. Add to 
the tomatoes two onions chopped fine and four large green peppers de- 
nuded of seeds and cut into rings. Turn the vinegar over the mixture 
and boil steadily 20 minutes ; then bottle. 

Mixed Pickle. — Three bundled small cucumbers, two heads of cauli- 
flower, one of cabbage, six green peppers with seeds taken out, three 
quarts small onions and two quarts small beans. Cut the cabbage and 
the cauliflower in small pieces, and put all in a brine strong enough to 
bear up an egg. Let them remain 24 hours, then rinse and drain thor- 
oughly. Place on the stove two gallons of vinegar, add a large root 
of horseradish, grated, two ounces each of mustard seed and black pep- 
per, one teaspoon cayenne, and one ounce of turmeric. Let it boil and 
pour over pickles in a jar. When cold mix in one cupful of mustard 
wet with cold vinegar. 

Mixed Pickle No. 2. — One-half medium-sized head of cabbage, four 
celery roots, four tablespoonfuls grated horseradish, six large green 
tomatoes, one large or two small Spanish onions, V/2 quart of vinegar, 
one-fourth teaspoonful of powdered alum. Chop all the vegetables and 
mix them together. Put a layer about two inches thick in the bottom 
of a jar, sprinkle it with a tablespoonful of salt, then another layer of 
vegetables and salt, and so on until all is used. Allow it to stand 24 
hours, then drain, and press out all the liquor; cover with boiling 
water, allow it to stand 10 minutes, then press with the hands until 
entirely dry. Add to one quart of vinegar 'J4 teaspoonful of alum, and 
stir until dissolved. Put a layer of the pickles two inches thick in the 
bottom of a jar, sprinkle with mustard seed, black pepper, and the 
grated horseradish; then another layer of pickle, and so on until used. 
Pour the vinegar over, let it stand two days, and it is ready for use. 

Mock Olives.— Two quarts of green plums, 1^ tablespoonful mus- 
tard seed, 2^ tablespoonfuls salt, two quarts vinegar. Place the plums 
in a stone jar with mustard seed and salt; turn the vinegar into a pre- 
serving kettle, bring to a boil and pour over plums. Cover closely. 



168 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Next day drain off the vinegar, bring again to a boil and pour over 
plums while hot. If plums are large repeat the third morning. When 
cold place all in olive bottles and cork tightly. They will taste like 
real olives. 

Muskmelon Pickles.— Pare the lind off ripe, spicy, green melons, re- 
move the seeds and cut into thick slices. Weigh as for peaches, seven 
pounds of fruit to three and one-quarter pounds of sugar, and put the 
sugar to cook with water enough to dissolve it. Boil and skim it until 
clear, then pour it over the melon in a crock. Repeat this for three 
mornings, but on the third morning add a cupful of vinegar to each 
three pints of syrup and boil it up with a cupful of spices in a bag. 
Pour it over the melon in jars and seal it once. 

Mustard Pickles. — Two quarts small cucumbers, one qqart small 
onions, one quart green tomatoes, one large cauliflower, six green pep- 
pers, quartered. Lay in weak brine twenty-four hours, then scald in 
same water and drain. Paste— six tablespoonfuls English mustard, one 
tablespoouful tumeric, one and one-half cup of sugar, one small cup 
of flour, two quarts best cider vinegar. Mix dry ingredients thor- 
oughly, add vinegar, boil a few minutes, pour over pickles and bottle. 

Mustard Pickles No. 2. — This differs from mo.st recipes for this 
pickle in being made without green- tomato. Put one-half peck smaill 
encumbers, two quarts silver skinned onions, and two heads of picked 
cauliflower to soak in water to cover and a cupful of salt over night. In 
the morning drain ; mix one dessertspoonful of turmeric powder with 
three-quarters of a pound cf the best mustard; wet with sufficient 
vinegar to mix without lumps. Put three quarts of vinegar over the 
fire, add five cents' wcrth of mixed pickling spices, one-half ounce 
celery seed, one-half ounce v/hite mustard seed, one teaspoonful each 
of cinnamon and cloves, one pound of brown sugar, carefully stir in 
the mustard and turmeric pai:te and let boil' up well; then add the 
mixed pickles, two red peppers chopped with the seeds of same, and 
stir all together. After it begins to bubble let boil _well for five minutes. 

Mustard Pickles No. 3. — Equal quantities of cucumbers, celery, cauli- 
flower and small button onions. Cut all in small pieces except the 
onions. Cover with strongly-salted water for 24 hours ; drain, put into 
a jar, and pour on hot vinegar (not too strong) sufficient to cover. Let 
the pickles stand three days, and then drain. To five quarts of the 
pickle use three quarts of cider vinegar, one cupful of sugar, and two 
tablespoonfuls of butter. Heat to boiling, then stirring constantly (for 
fear of burning) add cne cupful of flour, six tablespoonfuls of ground 
mustard and one-half ounce of turmeric powder wetted in cold vinegar. 
Stir till smooth, and pour over the pickle while hot; stir well. When 
cold cover close. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 



IM 



Sliced Mustard Pickles.— One dozen large cucumbers sliced, two 
dozen very small cucumbers, one quart of small onions, one large cauli- 
flower, steamed slightly. Soak all these ingredients in cold brine over 
night. Paste for the pickles is made as follows: One-half pound of 
'ground yellow mustard, one tcacupful of flour, one teacupful of sugar, 
one-half ounce of turmeric. Rub the above ingredients together with a 
little vinegar imtil smooth. Then add three quarts of vinegar, letting 
,it scald until a thick paste. Next add one-half ounce of celery seed, 
and pour the hot paste over the pickles, put in cans and seal. 

Nasturtium Pods Pickled.— Put the pods to soak in weak brine 
for two days, then in fresh water one day; drain, put in a jar, and 
cover with boiling vinegar. The vinegar may be spiced if desired, but 
if the pods are to be used in sauce they are better unspiced. 

Pickled Onions. — First pour boiling water over the onions to loosen 
the skins. As soon as cool enough to handle begin to peel, dropping 
the onions as peeled into salt water (not brine) to prevent their being 
discolored. Make a strong brine, heat to the boiling point, and pour 
ever the onions. Leave them in the brine 48 hours, then drain. Spice 
vinegar according to taste, l>eat to boiling point, and pour over the 
.onions. Set away for two or three days, drain off the vinegar, heat it 
again, and pour it over the onions in the jars in which they are to be 
'stored; tie up the jars and set away. 

Pickled Peaches. — For pickling select medium-sized peaches, ripe and 
firm. Rub off the down with a piece of flannel. To eight pounds of 
fruit use fbur pounds of granulated sugar, one quart of vinegar, two 
ounces of stick cinnamon. Boii the sugar, vinegar and cinnamon for five 
minutes. Then put in the peaches carefully, a few at a time. If one 
likes cloves, two or three may be stuck in each peach. When the 
peaches arc done enough to be easily pricked with a fork, take them out 
and put in the jar. When the peaches are all cooked boil the syrup 
iill a little thick, pour over peaches and seal cans or jars. 

Sweet Pickled Peaches. — Cut the peaches in two, remove the stones, 
and close the openings with halves together, pack in jars, and cover with 
the following liquid : To two pounds of sugar add one pint of vinegar 
(best cider vinegar alone should be used for all pickles), tie in a bag 
a teaspoonful of whole cloves, one-half teaspoonful cassia buds, three 
sticks of cinnamon (broken) and some tiny bits of ginger, allspice and 
nutmeg (about a teaspoonful in all). • Scald three times and seal the 
^ars. Keep in dark, dry place ; when ready to use remove the spice. 

Sweet Pickled Pears. — Select ripe but firm fruit, peel and measure 
out for every seven pounds of fruit four of white sugar, one pint of soft 
vinegar and half a tablespoonful each of whole cloves, whole allspice 



170 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

and cinnamon sticks. Put the pears in a kettle and over each layer 
sprinkle sugar until both are exhausted. Heat slowly until the boiling 
point is reached, then add the vinegar and spice and boil five minutes. 
Take out the fruit with a perforated skimmer and spread upon platters 
to cool. Boil the syrup till thick. Heat the jars, pack in the pears 
and pour the syrup over boiling hot; seal. 

Pepper Hash.— Wash and dry five large green peppers and one red 
one, remove seeds and chop shells quite fine; chop fine a good-sized 
cabbage, and place with the peppers in a bowl, mixing well. Add two 
tablespoonfuls of brown mustard seed, three tablespoonfuls of salt and 
enough good cider vinegar to cover the whole. Stir well together and 
put into pickle bottles. Ready for use in two days, or will keep for 
Winter use. 

Pepper Mangoes. — Two dozen full-grown pods of red pepper. Cut 
out the stems with a sharp knife and scrape out the seeds. Lay the pods 
in brine and let soak for 24 hours. Drain. Make a dressing of finely 
chopped cabbage, enough to fill the peppers, seasoned with one table- 
spoonful each of salt and pulverized mustard seed, one teaspoonful of 
grated horseradish, one teaspoonful of black pepper and one tablespoon- 
ful of made mustard. When well mixed stuff the peppers, sew the 
stems on with a coarse thread, pack in a stone jar, cover with strong 
vinegar and let .stand two weeks before using. 

Pickled Peppers. — Put two dozen green peppers in a bowl and pour 
over them a very strong brine. Put a weight over them to keep them 
under the water and let them lie for two days. Drain th_em, make a 
small incision in the side of each to let out the water, wipe them with 
a soft cloth and put them in a stone jar, with one-half ounce of whole 
allspice, one-half ounce of whole cloves and a small lump of alum. Pour 
cold vinegar over them and tie a bladder securely over the jar. Pickled 
in this way. the peppers should preserve their color. 

Pepper Relish. — Remove the seeds from six large green peppers and 
one red bell pepper, and chop the peppers fine. Mix the peppers with 
a finely minced head of cabbage. Turn in a little less than a quarter 
of a cupful of salt, a full cupful of sugar, two tablespoonfuls of mu's- 
lard seed and nice cider vinegar enough to cover the mixture. Stir 
thoroughly and bottle. 

Piccalilli. — Two pecks of green tomatoes, two heads of white cab- 
bage, 12 large onions, four green peppers, two red peppers, one good 
root of horseradish (grated), one tablespoonful each of cinnamon, nut- 
meg and allspice. Chop all fine, stir in two cups of salt and let stand 
all night, then drain; cover with cold vinegar, boil 10 minutes and drain 
again. Cover with vinegar, add the spices and three pounds of brown 
sugar. Boil a few minutes and put away in jars. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 171 

Canned Pimentos. — These ?.re simply red peppers, the long, tapering, 
sharp-pointed sweet variety. They repay one for the trouble, as they 
retail at 15 cents a can, and in glass jars at 35 cents per quart. Select 
ripe red ones, neither dry nor woody. Cut off stem end and extract the 
seeds. Drop in a jar and cover with brine that will float an egg. Let 
stand three days. Wash in several waters, cover with clear water one 
day, then drain well. Place peppers in cans, fill to overflowing with 
boiling water, add a level tablespoonful of salt to each quart of water; 
place in a boiler on two-inch layer of straw, weight cans to prevent 
tipping, pour in boiling water to cover two-thirds of the can, screw 
lids on loosely and cover the boiler. When the water boils simmer 10 
minutes, remove and seal. They are used in salads, as a relish with 
cold meats or are stuffed with rice, macaroni or bread crumbs. 

Pumpkin Pickle. — This is very good when there is a scarcity of' 
apples. Pare the pumpkins carefully, leaving out all soft or stringy 
parts, then cut into pieces about one or two inches square. Soak over 
night in vinegar, salt and water, just enough vinegar and salt to make 
a good flavor. The next day make a pickle as you would for any nice 
pickle and let them simmer on the back of the stove for a long time; 
without stirring. Our rule for pickle is seven pounds fruit, four pounds 
sugar and one pint of vinegar. We usually flavor the pumpkin pickle 
with either sliced lemon or ginger root. 

Quince Sweet Pickles. — Scrub with a small vegetable brush to re- 
riiove the down, wipe dry and cut out any spots or decayed portions. 
Slice, without paring, into rounds a fourth of an inch thick, leaving in 
both core and seeds, unless imperfect, then weigh. Put the fruit, a 
thin layer at a time, in a steamer or colander over boiling water, cover 
closely and steam until it is perfectly tender, then place in a stone 
jar. Make the syrup of four pounds of sugar, a pint of vinegar of 
medium strength, a pint of the water over which the fruit was steamed. 
an ounce of stick cinnamon, a heaping tablespoonful of allspice berries 
and a level tablespoonful of whole cloves to seven pounds of the fruit. 
Pour over the fruit, cover securely and stand in a cool place over 
night. The next morning drain off the syrup, boil for 10 minutes with 
the spice bag, skim and pour again boiling hot over the fruit. Continue 
this process for three successive mornings. The last morning add the 
fruit to the syrup and spices and boil gently until heated through, then 
skim out and put into the crock. Continue to boil the syrup until it is 
as thick as molasses. If, after the second boiling, it does not seem 
spiced sufficiently, add more spices tied in a fresh bag. When the syrup 
is done, reheat the quinces in it, then fill into self-sealing glass jars as 
in canning. 

Red Cabbage Pickle.— Cut a red cabbage of good size into six pieces, 



172 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

sprinkle it with salt and leave it for a day and a night. Then drain off 
the liquid, rinse it with cold water and let it soak in fresh cold water. 
Scald half a gallon of vinegar with a dozen whole cloves and white pep- 
pers and a few blades of mace broken fine. Turn in half a cupful of 
sugar and two or three tablespoonfuls of celery seed. Cook slowly for 
a quarter of an hour. Have the cabbage, drained and dried, packed into 
a stone jar. Turn the hot vinegar over it and put it in a cool place. 
The cabbage will be at its best in two months. 

Spanish Sauce.— -One peck green tomatoes, one quart onions, six 
large sweet peppers, four quarts ripe tomatoes, two heads celery chopped 
fine, two pounds brown sugar, one gallon vinegar, one teaspoonful 
cayenne pepper, three tablespoonfuls cinnamon, one tablespoonful each 
of allspice, mace and cloves. Chop green tomatoes, onions and seeded 
peppers, salt and let stand over night. In the morning strain through 
a cloth until perfectly dry. - Then mix all the ingredients and boil until 
tender. . 

Tomato Conserve.— Cut five large sound tomatoes into pieces and 
cook them until they are tender, with two onions in which three or 
four cloves have been stuck, two bay leaves and salt and pepper to 
taste. Then turn the fruit on to a fine sieve placed over a bowl and 
drain ofif the juice. Boil the juice until it has been half reduced. Next 
remove the onions and bay leaves from the tomatoes left oh the sieve 
and press the pulp through the fine meshes. Add to it the juice, put 
the mixture into wide mouthed bottles ; cover them loosely and stand 
them in a kettle of warm water (it should be about their own tem- 
perature). Bring the water to a boil and boil for half an hour. Leave 
the bottles in the kettle until they are cool, then tighten their covers 
and set them in the dark. 

Egg Tomatoes in Sweet Pickle. — Pour scalding water over seven 
pounds of the egg tomatoes, let them stand for a moment, then remove 
the skin. Cover them Avith vinegar much diluted with water and let 
them stand 12 hours. Put one-half cupful of weak vinegar in the pre- 
serving kettle and add part of the tomatoes, then some sugar and any 
whole spices, such as ginger, allspice, cinnamon, cloves and mace, using 
these or even more varieties according to taste. Add more of the to- 
matoes, more sugar and more spices, alternating the layers thus until 
all the tomatoes and five pounds of sugar have been used. Cook very 
gently, stirring just enough to prevent scorching without breaking the 
tomatoes. When these are quite clear and transparent, remove them 
carefully and boil down the syrup. When the syrup is thick strain ' it 
and add the torhatoes, Boil up once and pour into pint jars to be sealed 
at once, 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 173 

French .Sweet Pickle.— One peck green tomatoes chopped and six 
large onions sliced. Salt them and let stand over night. Then drain off 
the watery part and cover with vinegar, add two teaspoons of baking 
soda dissolved iti a little water, and let the whole boil for 15 minutes. 
Take two pounds of brown sugar, two ounces of cinnamon, one ounce 
of ground cloves and one-half pound of white mustard seed and mix 
dry. Put this in the kettle with three quarts of vinegar. Once more 
dram the tomato of its liquid part, add it to the spice and vinegar and 
cook for an hour. 

Green Tomato Chili Sauce.— Slice the green tomatoes and salt down 
as you do egg plant, put a weight on them and let stand until morn- 
ing, then rinse in cold water to take out the salt and wash out the seeds 
and bitter juice of the green tomato. For 13 tomatoes take four sweet 
green peppers, half dozen chili peppers, one large onion, one cupful 
vinegar, one tablespoonful sugar, two teaspoonfuls of salt, one of pep- 
per, two of ground allspice, half teaspoonful of mace, one of cinnamon, 
one of cloves. Chop the tomatoes fine, boil 20 minutes, strain and press 
through a sieve. Chop the peppers and onions very fine, first taking out 
the seeds of the peppers. Boil all together for 10 minutes ; add spices, 
then bottle and seal. 

Green Tomato Chow Chow. — Chop fine one peck of green tomatoes, 
three onions, six green peppers; sprinkle them lightly with salt, let stand 
an hour, then scald in the juices. Put three quarts of vinegar in a 
porcelain-lined kettle with one pint of sugar and a few pieces of horse- 
radish root. Boil for five minutes, add the tomatoes and boil five 
minutes longer, put into stone jars, cover and set in cool, dry place. 
Whole cloves, mace and stick cinnamon may be added to this if you want 
a spiced pickle. 

Easy Green Tomato Pickle.— Slice the tomatoes and allow them to 
stand in weak salt brine over night. In the morning rinse and pack 
directly in fruit jars. Place the. jars uncovered in the steamer and steam 
for about two hours. Have ready at the end of that time a sweet-spiced 
vinegar made exactly as you do for pickling peaches, and after draining 
all the juice that cooks from the sliced tomatoes, fill the cans brim-full 
with it and seal as in canning anything. 

Green Tomato Sweet Pickle. — Wash the tomatoes and let drain, then 
slice into a large earthen dish, sprinkling salt between the layers. Let 
stand till next day. Pour off the brine and juice, rinse off with clear 
water, let the fruit drain, then weigh if you like to follow the exact 
rule. To a syrup made of brown sugar and a little water add ginger 
root, cloves and cinnamon bark. Also tie up two or three little bags of 
mixed, ground spices to cook with the rest. Add the tomato and a 
handful of nasturtium seeds, and cook till the tomato seems tender. 



174 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

The nasturtium seeds should be not more than half grown, green, and 
if in clusters, so much the better, Skim out the tomato into a stone 
jar, add a liberal quantity of vinegar to the juice left in the kettle, and 
when it boils up pour over the contents of the jar. 

Green Tomato Mangoes. — Select smooth tomatoes of good shape 
and showing no signs of ripening. Cut across one-fourth of the length 
below the stem and carefully extract the seeds and pulp. Have ready 
a filling composed of two parts finely chopped cabbage and one part 
onions, also chopped fine, and season to taste with celery and mustard 
seeds,, pepper and sugar. Fill the tomato shells as full as possible and 
tie the tops firmly on with strong cord. Let the mangoes lie over night 
in very strong brine, then soak them for 24 hours in weak vinegar. 
Pack in a stone jar, leaving plenty of space above them, and fill the jar 
with three parts vinegar to One part water, sweetened to the taste. 
These mangoes may be made either sweet or sour as preferred. A few 
pieces of horseradish root will season and preserve the vinegar. 

Tomato soy is made with both green and ripe fruit. The following 
is an excellent tested recipe for ripe tomato soy: Peel and chop a 
peck of ripe tomatoes until they are quite fine. Then put them upon 
the fire in a preserving kettle with a half a teacupful of whole cloTOs ; 
the same quantity of whole allspice; a scant teacupful of salt; a table- 
spoonful of black pepper, and three red pepper and five onions, all of 
which have been chopped fine. Let the ingredients boil together for fully 
an hour, and immediately add a quart of the best cider vinegar. When 
the soy has cooled sufiiciently, it may be bottled. 

Green Tomato Soy. — One peck green tomatoes; one quart onions, salt 
and vinegar as desired ; one teaspoonf ul ground cloves ; one tea- 
spoonful ginger ; one teaspoonf ul cinnamon ; the same of black pepper ; 
Yi teaspoonful red pepper; J,-^ pound brown sugar; half a grated nut- 
meg. Wash the tomatoes and cut in slices, also the onions. Place a 
layer of tomatoes and then sprinkle with salt, next a layer of onions in 
the same way — until all are done. Let stand over night. In the morn- 
ing drain well and then put on the stove to cook, covering the prepara- 
tion with vinegar. Add the spices and let it boil slowly together four 
or five hours; then bottle hot, leaving the covers off the jars till the 
next day. 

Tomato Mustard, — To one peck of ripe tomatoes add two teaspoon- 
fuls of salt and stew half an hour; then pass through a sieve. Add 
two dessertspoonfuls of fin-ely chopped onions, one dessertspoonful each 
of whole pepper, allspice and cloves tied in a muslin bag, and half a 
teaspoonful of cayenne; simmer down one-third, then stir in a tea- 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 175 

spoonful of curry powder and a teacupful of mustard; simmer half an 
hour longer, then bottle. 

Ripe Tomato Pickle. — Mix in the order given one and a half pints 
of firm ripe tomatoes, peeled and chopped, one-half cupful of chopped 
celery, two tablespoonfuls of chopped red pepper, two tablespoonfuls of 
chopped onion, two tablespoonfuls of salt, three tablespoonfuls of sugar, 
three tablespoonfuls of mustard seed, one-quarter teaspoonful of cloves, 
one-half teaspoonful of cinnamon, one-half teaspoonful of grated nut- 
meg and one cupful of vinegar. Stir thoroughly, put in a stone jar and 
cover. It should stand one week before using, but may be kept one 
year. 

Green Tomato Pickle. — Slice very thinly one peck of green to- 
matoes and two quarts of onions, sprinkling them all with a little salt, 
and let them stand till next day. Now drain them through a colander, 
put them on with enough good vinegar to cover them, and boil very 
gently till clear and tender. Then drain them from the vinegar. Put 
into about the same quantity of fresh vinegar two pounds of brown 
sugar, one -half pound of white mustard seed, one-half ounce of ground 
mace, one tablespoonful each of celery seed and ground cloves, and boil 
them all together for a few minutes ; then pour it over the drained to- 
matoes, which have been previously mixed with one dessertspoonful of 
cayenne, one full teaspoonful each of ground mustard and of tur- 
meric; mix this all well together, add about half a pint of good salad 
oil, and, when cold, put it into jars. 

Sour Green Tomato Pickle. — Peel green tomatoes and to each quart 
add three small cucumbers, one pint small white onions, two green pep- 
pers, quarter of a pound of salt, and half a pound of mustard seed. 
Chop all fine, mix and set away in a jar for twenty-four hours ; then 
cover with good vinegar and place bits of horseradish root on totp. 
Cover, but do not seal. 

Tomato Puree. — -Break ripe sound tomatoes in halves and crush them 
as they heat slowly. When they are tender strain and push the pulp 
through a sieve, season with salt and pepper and turn into glass jars. 
Put the cover on loosely, stand the jars in a pan of warm water and 
boil for half an hour. Then screw the covers on firmly. Use for mak- 
ing soups or gravies. 

Spiced Tomatoes. — Put into a preserving pan four pounds of good 
red tomatoes, two pounds of brown sugar, one pint of good vinegar 
(cider vinegar if possible), and one-half ounce each of cloves and stick 
cinnamon. Stew this altogether very gently till the tomatoes are cooked, 
but not broken; then lift them out and set them aside to cool. Con- 
tinue simmering very slowly till it is as thick as syrup. When the toma- 



176 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

toes are quite cold, reheat them gently in the syrup and again lift them 
out, packing them, when perfectly cold, in jars, pouring the thick 
syrup (also quite cold) over them, and cover tight. 

Virginia Pickle. — This is uncooked. In a three-gallon jar mix one 
gallon of strong vinegar, one-half pint of salt, three pounds of brown 
sugar, two ounces each of black pepper, brown ginger, celery seed, mus- 
tard seed, mace, cloves, horseradish and allspice, one-half box of ground 
mustard, a little red pepper and one-half dozen pepper pods. Peel three 
dozen onions and put them with fresh cucumbers, just from the vine, 
washed and wiped dry, into the spiced vinegar, using enough cucumbers to 
fill the jar. Agitate the pickles every other morning for several months 
or until cool weather comes. Then add more sugar until the pickles 
have a pleasant taste. 

Pickled Walnuts. — The walnuts must be gathered while young and 
green, and be laid in strong brine. Leave them in this for a week, 
changing it every other day. Take them out, dry them between two 
cloths and pierce each with a large needle. Throw them into cold 
water and leave them several hours before packing them in small jars 
and pouring over them scalding hot seasoned vinegar, prepared in the 
following proportions : Four quarts of vinegar, one cupful of sugar, 
three dozen cloves, three dozen black peppers, 18 whole allspice and 13 
blades of mace boiled together for five minutes. 

Yellow Mustard Pickle. — One-half gallon vinegar, three dozen sliced 
cucumbers, three dozen onions, one tablespoonful turmeric, one table- 
spoon mustard, one-half cup each of sugar and flour, and one-third 
teaspoon of red pepper. Pare and slice cucumbers and onions, cover 
with water, add one-half cup salt and let stand over night. In the 
morning drain the cucumbers and onions ; put vinegar on the stove to 
boil, mix the spices, sugar and flour in a little cold vinegar, add to the 
boiling vinegar and let boil five minutes, stirring constantly; then put 
in cucumbers and onions, boil 15 minutes and seal in jars while hot. 

Vinegar for Yellow Pickles. — This may be used for cucumbers, to- 
matoes or any other vegetable desired. Use one-half pound of grated 
horseradish, one pound of white mustard seed, one-half pound of black 
mustard seed, one ounce each of mace, nutmegs, cloves, allspice and 
ground white pepper, two ounces of turmeric, one-half cupful of ground 
mustard, two tablespoonfuls of celery seed, four cloves of garlic, one- 
quarter pound of ground ginger and two pounds of brown sugar. Pu£ 
in a three-gallon jar with two gallons of vinegar. Stir frequently and let 
remain for several weeks before using. This will keep any length of 
time. Half quantity may be prepared for the use of a small family. 

Corn Vinegar.— A friend says she prefers this to cider vinegar: 
One pint corn cut from cob; one pint of brown sugar or molasses, to 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 1T7 

one gallon of rain water. Put in a large jar. Keep covered with a 
cloth. Set in the snn. In a month you will have good vinegar. 

Fruit Vinegars.— Among suggestions for making vinegar given by a 
correspondeiit of Good Housekeeping, it is stated that half-gallon fruit 
jars are better than stone jugs to make it in, as a larger surface is 
exposed to the light and air, and by shaking often, oxygenation, souring, 
is hastened. A cloth should, of course, be tied over the top to keep out 
insects and dust. The jars should be set in the sun, and whenever the 
fluid has worked clear, strain cff and leave it in a warm place until it is 
as sharp as desired. When mother forms, new vinegar can be made by 
simply adding sweetened water. Always use soft water, but if it is not 
available, boil the water and set it in the sun a day or two. To make 
vinegar from apple or peach parings, fill a jar half full of parings, add 
one-half teacup molasses, and fill up with water. Set in the sun and 
strain for use in about two weeks. Tomato vinegar is made by mashing 
and straining a quart of ripe tomatoes, putting in a jar with one cupful 
of sugar or molasses, then filling the jar with soft water, and keeping in 
a sunny place two weeks. In default of other material vinegar may be 
made from yeast. Dissolve half a teacupful of brown sugar in one pint 
of warm water, add one small yeast cake, and fill the jar with water. 
This must be left to work for two weeks. 

Gooseberry Vinegar. — Boil one gallon of water; when cold add three 
quarts of ripe gooseberries, mashed. Allow it to stand for four days, 
stirring every day. On the fourth day strain through a sieve to remove 
the seeds, then barrel. To e;ch gallon of the liquid add lyi pound 
sugar, and one-eighth cake of compressed yeast. We used to use barm 
(the foam from fermenting beer) which was the ordinary form of yeast 
years ago in communities where home brewing was practiced. Stir every 
day until the vinegar, has done fermenting, then close the barrel. Green 
or amber gooseberries are best. This is a very superior vinegar. 

Honey Vinegar. — One friend says she uses V/i pound of strained 
honey to a gallon of water, but Bulletin 146 of the- Ontario (Canada) 
Department of Agriculture advises iVz ounce of honey to one gallon of 
clear, soft water. Store in a barrel with an opening to permit air circu- 
lation, in a warm place; at the end of a year it is ready for use. The 
Ontario bulletin says its keeping qualities are excellent, and the best of 
pickles can be made with it, while it is recommended for salads. 

Spiced Vinegar. — This gives a fine flavor to green vegetables, such as 
cucumbers, cabbage, cauliflower, beans, salads, etc. For each quart of 
vinegar slice a clove of garlic, a small onion, a two-inch root of horse- 
radish, half an ounce of bruised ginger root, a teaspoonful each of 
unground black pepper, allspice and mustard seed. Put all in a stone jar 
and simmer on the range for five hours. Then strain and bottle for use.

CATSUPS AND SAUCES. 

Barberry Catsup. — Stew three quarts of barberries with three cupfuls 
of water til) well cooked, then strain through a sieve. In a separate 
saucepan stew four quarts of cranberries, a cupful of raisins, a large 
quince sliced, four small onions minced and a quart of water for half an 
hour, then pass through a sieve; mix with the barberry juice and add 
half a cupful of vinegar, one-fourth of a cupful of salt, two cupfuls of 
brown sugar, a dessertspoonful each of ground cloves and ground all- 
spice, two tablespoonfuls each of black pepper and celery seed, one 
teaspoonful of cayenne, cinnamon and ginger and a grated nutmeg. Let 
the whole boil one minute. If too thick add vinegar or water. This recipe 
is given by Miss Parlna ; some cooks make ihe catsup omitting the quince 
and cranberries. 

Bordeaux Sauce. — Two quarts of cabbage chopped to a powder, one 
quart of chopped green tomatoes, drained free of juice, three small onions 
chopped, one quart of vinegar, one-quarter ounce each of celery seed, 
black pepper, ginger and turmeric, one-eighth pound of mustard seed, 
one-quarter cupful of salt, and one-half pound of brown sugar; mix 
together, boil 15 minutes, and can while hot. 

Chili Sauce. — Peel and chop fine -one onion, and six large tomatoes, 
add one green sweet Spanish pepper and one small hot chili pepper, 
chopped; then season with one cupful of vinegar, one tablespoonful salt, 
two teaspoonfuls brown sugar, one teaspoonful each of ground ginger, 
cinnamon, cloves and black pepper, and half a nutmeg. Boil slowly until 
very thoroughly cooked, then bottle and seal when cold. 

Chutney Sauce. — Eight ounces of tart apples, peeled and cored, eight 
ounces of peeled tomatoes, eight ounces brown sugar, eight ounces salt, 
four ounces powdered ginger, four ounces red peppers, two ounces 
shallots (or onion), two ounces garlic. Pound all together in a mortar 
(or pass through a chopper set to cut fine) and then put all the materials 
together in a jar with 2J^ pints good vinegar. Place the jar in a warm 
place, covered for one month, stirring with a wooden spoon twice every 
day. At the end of the time pass the chutney through a sieve, and bottle, 
when it is ready for use. The intense heat of the peppers grows milder 
with keeping, and the chutney improves and becomes richer in flavor. 

Peach Chutney. — Pare and halve sufficient peaches to weigh, when 
ready, three pounds. Put them in a large agate saucepan, add one pint 
of vinegar and stew gently until tender. Pound together in a mortar 
four ounces of white onions, two ounces garlic and five ounces of fresh 
ginger root ; add these to the peaches with six ounces each of sugar, 
seeded raisins and white mustard seed. Add two ounces of dried chillies 
and one cupful of vinegar. Simmer for 10 minutes longer, then bottle. 
This is a familiar old English recipe. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 179 

Cranberry Catsup (Good Housekeeping). — One quart of cranberries, 
one cup of water and two cups of vinegar. Tie in a piece of muslin a 
few cloves, three or four allspice, about a dessertspoon of broken cinna- 
mon, and some mace. Simmer all together in a preserving kettle until 
the fruit is perfectly soft. Press through a colander, add one pound of 
brown sugar, simmer 10 minutes longer, and seal. This recipe will make 
a most delicious catsup, and one conveniently made in small quantities 
at any time throughout the Winter. 

Cucumber Catsup. — For a small quantity take 12 fine full-grown 
cucumbers and lay them an hour in cold water. Then pare them and 
grate them down in a deep dish. Grate also, six small onions and mix 
them with the grated cucumber; season the mixture to your taste with 
pepper, salt and vinegar, making it of the consistency of jam. When 
thoroughly mixed put it in a glass jar, cover closely so that it will be 
perfectly air-tight. It will be found very nice to eat with beef or mutton, 
and if properly made and tightly covered it will keep well. It should be 
grated very fine, and the vinegar must be real cider vinegar. 

Ripe Cucumber Catsup. — (Some people call this a "salad," but it is 
worth making under any name.) Peel 13 large, ripe cucumbers ; remove 
seeds and pulp; chop the solid meat; mix with it a cupful of salt and 
hang in bag to drain. Chop 12 large onions and six peppers and mix 
with the cucumbers. Mix together one-fourth pound white mustard seed ; 
one-half cupful celery seed, and one cupful of sugar. Mix all together; 
cover with cold vinegar; put in cans and fix tops firmly. The above, or 
any similar preparations should be kept in a dark, cool place. If the 
darkness is not available, wrap the cans with papers. 

Cooked Cucumber Catsup.— Choose large, nearly ripe cucumbers; pare, 
reject seeds, chop very fine and measure. Allow one teaspoonful of salt 
for every pint of pulp, sprinkle with same and drain through a colander 
for six hours. For every quart of cucumber allow two cups of cider 
vinegar, four teaspoonfuls of grated horseradish, one tablespoonful each 
of white mustard seed and minced red pepper (seeds rejected) ; bring 
vinegar and flavoring to a boil, skim thoroughly and set aside until 
perfectly cold. Then add the pulp to the vinegar, stir well, put into pint 
jars, lay a nasturtium or horseradish leaf over the top and seal. Keep 
in a dark, cool place. 

Currant Catsup. — To five pounds of currants allow three pounds of 
sugar, one tablespoon of cinnamon, one tablespoonful of cloves, one 
tablespoonful of allspice, one teaspoonful of black pepper, one teaspoonful 
of salt and half a pint of vinegar. Mash the currants and rub them 
through a sieve; then, add the other ingredients and boil for twenty 
minutes. Bottle as you would tomato ?atsup, 



180 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Gooseberry Catsup.— Five pounds of fruit, three pounds of sugar, V/z 
quart of vinegar, one tablespoonful of cloves, three tablespoonfuls of 
cinnamon, two tablespoonfuls of allspice. Wash the berries, put them in 
a porcelain stewpan, mash them well, add the other ingredients and boil 
until thick. Seal while hot. 

Grape Catsup.— Pick seven pounds of grapes off the stems, wash them, 
put them in a stone jar and set the jar over the fire in a deep pot of 
boiling water. Let the grapes cook in this manner for an hour in order 
to loosen the seeds. Remove from the fire and strain through a sieve, 
being careful that all the pulp goes through. Then add a pint of good 
cider vinegar, three and a half pounds of sugar and a teaspoonful each 
of cinnamon and cloves. Return to the fire and cook until thick. 

Mushroom Catsup.— The mushrooms should be freshly gathered; care- 
fully examined to see that they harbor no insects, and wiped, but not 
washed. Put a layer of mushrooms in the bottom of an earthen dish, 
and sprinkle well with salt; then another layer and more salt, continuing 
until all are used. Cover with a folded towel, and stand in a cool place 
for 24 hours; then mash and strain through a coarse bag. If put in a 
warm place the juice will ferment. To every quart of liquid add one 
ounce of pepper corns, and boil slowly in a porcelain-lined kettle for 30 
minutes ; then add one-fourth ounce whole allspice, one-half ounce sliced 
ginger root, one dozen whole cloves and three blades of mace. Boil 15 
minutes longer, then take from the fire and stand aside to cool. When 
cool, strain through flannel, and put in small bottles, iilling to the very 
top. Cork tightly, and dip cork in sealing wax. This is a delicious 
relish or seasoning, especially with poultry and mutton. 

Oude Sauce, — Four quarts of green tomatoes, 18 small peppers, 18; 
small white onions; chop all together, add three cupfuls of salt and let 
stand over night. In the morning drain off the water and add four

and most of the seeds ; put them in a kettle with three sliced onions, two 
cloves of garlic, one teaspoonful of salt, one pint of vinegar and one table- 
spoonful of grated horseradish^ boil together until the vegetables can be 
rubbed through a coarse sieve; return to the fire, add a pint of vinegar, 
one tablespoonful of brown sugar, one teaspoonful each of ground cloves, 
allspice and black pepper ; boil five minutes ; ' bottle and seal while hot. 

Plum Catsup, — Wash and drain four quarts of damson plums ; cover 
with a quart of water and cook slowly until tender, then press through a 
sieve, rubbing through as much pulp and skin as you can; return to the 
kettle; add three-quarters of a pound of sugar, two kv«l. teasBoonfulB>

until as thick as desired. Seal hot in pint jars. 

Red Pepper Catsup. — Two dozen pods of red pepper; put in a preserve 
kettle with a half pint of strong vinegar and a pint of water; set on the 
stove and let come to a boil. Add one root of grated horseradish, three 
sliced onions, six whole cloves and one-half ounce of white mustard seed. 
Let boil 10 minutes longer and strain. Put back in the kettle with a half 
teacupful of brown siigar, one ounce of -celery seed and a pint of strong 
vinegar. Boil one hour, then bottle. This catsup will keep any length 
of time. 

Shirley Sauce.— Chop very fine twenty-four large tomatoes, two large 
onions, two peppers ; add one tablespoonful of salt, two of sugar, one 
teaspoonful each of ginger, cloves, allspice, cinnamon, one nutmeg, one 
pint of vinegar. Stew one hour and bottle while hot. 

Southern Mixed Catsup. — Peel and cut up enough crisp, green cucum- 
bers to fill a half-gallon measure, sprinkle with salt and let stand six 
hours, press the water from them and scald in weak vinegar. Prepare 
half a gallon of cabbage in the same way. Chop one dozen small onions, 
cover with boiling water and let stand half an hour. Cut in slices one 
quart of green tomatoes, one pint of green beans, one dozen small ears 
of tender corn and one dozen green peppers. Scald and drain them.

desire the catsup and then add one quart vinegar, one-half pint salt, and 
the following spices: One tablespoonful each of cloves, ginger'and cinna- 
mon, two tablespoonfuls each of mustard, black pepper and allspice, and 
one-half teaspoonful cayenne pepper. Let it cook 10 minutes, then bottle 
and cork tight, no further sealing is needed as it will keep for years 
simply corked. 

Tomato Catsup No. 2. — Wash and cut in pieces a half peck of ripe 
tomatoes. Cook in a porcelain-lined or granite iron preserving kettle till 



183 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

soft enough to put through a sieve, which will remove skins and seeds. 
To the pulp add two tablespoonfuls of salt, two tablespoonfuls pepper, 
one-half tablespoon allspice, one-half tablespoon cloves and one-half pint 
vinegar. Let the tomato cook for several hours before adding the spices 
and vinegar. Mix the salt and spices dry in a bowl, and blend well before 
putting into the tomato. Cook till quite thick and put in bottles. Store 
in a cool cellar. 

Uncooked Tomato Catsup.— Peel and chop a peck of ripe tomatoes and 
hang in bag, to drain for 24 hours. Add to the drained tomato four 
bunches of celery (chopped fine) and one large cupful of chopped onion. 
Mix the three vegetables thoroughly and then add one-fourth cup of salt ; 
one-fourth cup sugar; two tablespoonfuls mustard seed; two tablespoon- 
fuls ground cinnamon ; one teaspoonful ground allspice, and two large red

CHAPTER XIII. 

SALADS. 

Beet Dressing.— One cupful vinegar, one-half cupful sugar, butter the 
size of a walnut, salt and pepper to taste, scant tablespoon of cornstarch 
or flour. Mix thoroughly, boil till it thickens, pour over the sliced boiled 
beets and serve immediateh'. 

Butter Dressing for Potato Salad.— One cupful butter, melted, into 
which is stirred one tablespoonful of flour, half cupful of vinegar, one 
teaspoonful salt, one egg, half teaspoonful mustard, and a little pepper. 
Add a small cupful of boiling water, and cook together until thickened 
like cream. 

Dressing With Bacon Fat. — Cook two tablespoonfuls of flour and a 
dash of paprika or red pepper in five tablespoonfuls of hot bacon fat. 
Add four or five tablespoonfuls of vinegar and half a cupful of water. 
Stir and cook until boiling. Then gradually pour over the beaten yolk 
of an egg (preferably two yolks). Return to the fire (over hot water) to 
cook the egg, and add salt if needed. Use when cold. This dressing is 
particularly good with endive or lettuce, alone or with eggs. 

French Dressing. — This consists of three tablespoonfuls of oil to one 
tablespoonful of vinegar. For every tablespoonful of vinegar and three 
of oil, take one-half teaspoonful of salt and one-fourth teaspoonful of 
black or white pepper. Mix the salt and pepper with the oil and add the 
vinegar gradually, stirring thoroughly until it becomes white and a little 
thickened. This dressing must be used as soon as it is made or it will 
separate. 

Prepared Dressing. — Here is a delicious salad dressing, which will keep 
a long time if put on ice, or in a cold place. Mix half a cupful of oil, 
five tablespoonfuls vinegar, half a teaspoonful powdered sugar, half a 
small Bermuda onion, finely chopped, two tablespoonfuls chopped parsley, 
half a tablespoonful chopped red pepper, one tablespoonful chopped green 
pepper, one teaspoonful salt. Let it stand for an hour, then whip up 
with an egg beater before using. 

Sour Cream Dressing. — Chill a cupful of rich sour cream until very 
cold, then beat well for five minutes, adding, while beating, a tablespoon- 
ful of powdered sugar and a half teaspoonful of lemon juice. Slice 
chilled cucumbers very thin, and serve with this dressing. 

Salad Dressing Without Oil.— Piece of butter the size of an egg. 
Heat in granite basin, add sifted flour till thick. Then add one cupful 
of milk. When smooth add one cupful vinegar ; two eggs (beaten) ; salt. 



1S4 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

pepper, red or black, mustarfl, seasoned as you wish ; one tablespoon of 
sugar. Cook till thick. The edition of a half cupful of well-beaten sour 
or sweet cream will be found excellent. This dressing on potatoes, cu- 
cumbers, lettuce or beets makes a most palatable salad. The friend who 
gave this says it is a dressing that will keep for some time. She always 
keeps a jar of it on hand. The left-over dish of beets, peas or string 
beans is put in the potato salad for supper. 

Mayonnaise. — Put the uncocked yolks of two eggs into an earthen 
bowl, beat them well with' a silver or wooden fork for about one minute; 
then add a half teaspoonful of salt, a dash of cayenne, and if you desire, 
a half-teaspoonful of mustard. Work these well together, and then add 
drop by drop, a half pint or more of olive oil. Stir rapidly and steadily 
v/hile adding the oil ; do not reverse the motion, or the mayonnaise may 
curdle. After stirring in the first gill of- oil, alternate occasionally with 
a few drops of lemon juice or vinegar. The more oil you use, the thicker 
the dressing. If too thick, add vinegar enough to make it the proper 
consistency. The mayonnaise should be kept as cool as possible during 
rhe making. 

Banana Salad. — The bananas are peeled, sliced lengthwise down the 
middle, dipped in mayonnaise, and laid, flat side up, on lettuce leaves. 
A layer of finely chopped peanuts is put on the banana, and a spoonful of 
mayonnaise dressing put by it. Serve with heated graham crackers. This 
is delicious. 

Beet Salad. — Slice and cut into dice enough cold boiled beets to make 
a pint; heap in the center of a salad dish, and cover with sauce Tartare. 
This is made by adding a few chopped olives, gherkins and capers to 
mayonnaise dressing. If the mayonnaise is not desired, any ordinary salad 
mixture may be used, and the salad garnished with hard-boiled eggs and 
parsley. 

Cream S'aw. — Cut a small half head of white, tender cabbage on a 
slaw cutter (or fine, with a sharp knife) ; sprinkle a very little black 
pepper over it, and add one-third of small teaspoonful of salt. Have 
ready a small half pint of thick sweet cream; add to this three even 
tablespoonfnis of granulated sugar; stir until dissolved, then whip this 
to a stiff froth, adding gradually two and a half tablespoonfnis of good 
vinegar. When finished pour over the cabbage, stirring it lightly until 
all is covered and stand in refrigerator, or in cold water, for 10 or 15 
minutes before serving. The slaw should not be made too long before 
serving, as the cold, crisp taste is most appetizing. 

Herring Salad.— Heat through by broiling, or in the oven, three smoked ' 
herrings. Then tear off the heads and pull the skin away; split, take out 
the backbones, and cut up into small bits, or to shred them is better. 
Put in a salad bowl, add one small chopped" onion, two hard-boiled eggs, 
chopped, and one boiled potato; cut fine with a teaspoonful of chopped 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 185 

parsley; season with a teaspoonful of salt, one of pepper, three table- 
spoonfuls of vinegar and two of oil ; mix well, and if you have it, deco- 
rate with a boiled, beet. 

Hot Slaw.— Cut a head of cabbage fine. Have ready enough dressing, 
iialf vinegar and half water, and one-fourth sugar, with a lump of butter 
to cover it. Simmer until done. It is good cold. It is well to salt the 
dressing a little, to taste. 

Potato Salad. — Slice cold boiled potatoes with one raw onion to sea- 
son. For the salad dressing, put on stove a saucepan with one pint of 
vinegar and butter the size of an egg. Beat two or three eggs with two 
tablespoonfuls of mustard and a small teaspoonful of salt, and one of 
black pepper, two tablespoonfuls of sugar. When thoroughly beaten pour 
slowly into the vinegar until it thickens. Be careful not to cook too 
long, or the egg will curdle. Remove and when cold pour over the salad. 
It improves this to add the yolks of two or three hard boiled eggs mashed 
fine and beaten in with the mustard, or add a cupful of cream. This will 
keep several days in a cool place if desired. Plain French dressing may 
be used instead if desired. 

German Potato Salad. — Boil a few extra potatoes at dinner time. 
When cold, carefully slice very thin. Set away to chill. When supper 
time comes, cut for a quart of sliced potatoes one good-sized onion into 
thin slices. Add a dash of pepper. Take two big slices of bacon, very 
fat, cut into cubes, fry, add one-half cupful of vinegar. Pour over the 
salad and toss lightly with two forks. 

Waldorf Salad. — Handsome red apples are selected, polished, but not 
peeled, cored, and then hollowed into cups. The pieces removed are 
mixed with chopped celery, put in the apple cups, a spoonful of mayon- 
n.^ise dressing being put over the top. The apples are put on individual 
plates, each fruit standing on a crinkly lettuce leaf. 



CHAPTER XIV. 

CHEESE. 

Cottage Cheese.— Bulletin No. 245, issued by the New York Experi- 
ment Station at Geneva, is devoted to this subject; it will be found help- 
ful by anyone making this cheese, either for market or domestic use. In 
describing the manufacture of this cheese, the bulletin says that good 
cottage cheese should have a soft, smooth texture, being neither mushy 
nor dry and sawdust like. The flavor should be that of mildly soured 
milk or well ripened cream, with an entire absence of bitter taste, flavor 
of stable, or other objectionable qualities. Such flavor may usually be 
secured by the use of a good starter; but if too much whey is retained 
the cheese -may be sour. Flavor and texture are quite closely connected, 
at this point, for a slow draining curd is liable to result in poor textured 
and poor flavored cheese. The various steps in making cottage cheese 
may be summarized as follows. 

Use skim-milk rather than whole milk, to avoid loss of fat. To se- 
cure proper flavor and speedy souring add a small amount of a good 
starter. This starter should be prepared from clean, fresh milk, sep- 
arated from the cream and placed in a carefully cleaned receptacle, well 
covered and brought to a temperature of 90 degrees, and then allowed to 
stand from 20 to 24 hours at a temperature of 65 to 78 degrees. The 
upper portion of this should be discarded and the amount needed strained 
through a fine strainer or hair sieve and thoroughly mixed with the milk 
from which ^cheese is to be made the next day. A portion may also be 
used in preparing a starter for the next day, but as soon as any unfav- 
orable effect is noticed a new starter should be prepared. Several good 
and convenient commercial starters are on the market, for use of which 
directions accompany each package. 

The milk is now kept at a temperature of 70 to 75 degrees until well 
curdled, often in 24 hours, sometimes not until 48 hours. The curdled 
mass is broken up by hand or by a curd knife, raised gradually to 90 de- 
grees, taking 30 to 40 minutes in the process. The whey should then 
separate clear in 15 to 20 minutes, after which it is run from the curd, 
and the latter placed in muslin bags or on racks to drain. When whey 
ceases to come from the curd, salt is added to taste or at the rate of 
about a pound for 100 pounds of cheese, the curd formed into balls and 
wrapped in oiled paper that may be obtained from any dairy supply 
house. For the finest quality of cheese, thick cream, preferably ripened 
cream, should be added at the rate of about an ounce for one pound 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 187 

of cheese, before the cheese is made into balls. If it is thought best to 
hasten the curdling rennet extract may be added about eight hours after 
the starter has been introduced, using one ounce of rennet extract for 
1,000 pounds of milk. 

Escalloped Cheese.— Into a buttered baking dish sprinkle a layer of 

coarse bread crumbs, with butter, pepper and salt on top. Next add a 

■ • layer of cheese, alternating with bread and cheese until the dish is full. 

Have bread crumbs on top, pour on sweet milk until you can see it by 

tilting the dish a little, and bake until done. 

Cheese Fondu.— Put one tablespoonful of butter in pan, then one cup 
milk; let it boil, then add one cup bread crumbs and two cups grated 
cheese, little pepper and dry mustard. When the cheese melts add two 
well-beaten eggs. 

Macaroni with Cheese. — Throw one-half box of macaroni into boiling 
water and cook 20 minutes. Never let the water stop boiling, or the 
macaroni will be soft. Drain and pour into a buttered baking dish. Have 
ready one cup of cheese cut into small pieces and stir this through the 
hot macaroni together with salt and pepper to taste and a lump of butter 
the size of a small egg. Add enough sweet milk almost to cover and 
sprinkle the top with more grated cheese. Bake three-quarters of an 
hour in a moderate oven. A good supper dish on a cold night. 

Cheese Patties. — When making pies line a number of patty pans with 
thin paste and bake. These will keep several days, but are better fresh. 
Grate one-fourth pound cheese and add one pint milk, one tablespoon 
flour, one-half teaspoon mustard or one dessertspoon prepared mustard, 
one tablespoon butter and salt and pepper to taste. Carefully heat to- 
gether, stirring to make a smooth mass. Serve hot in the patty shells. 

Cheese Puifs. — Make some puff paste ; roll it out and cut it into squares 
of about three inches. Beat the yolks of two eggs and a little made mus- 
tard, a dash of cayenne pepper and two tablespoonfuls of grated cheese, 
to form a thick paste. Place a spoonful of the mixture in each square 
of pastry, pull the four points to the center, pinching them together to 
make them stand up. Bake 10 minutes and serve very hot. 

Cheese Pudding. — Lay thin slices of stale bread, lightly buttered, in a 
baking dish, and cover with broken cheese, no matter how old and dry 
it is. Season with red pepper and salt. Fill the dish with alternate 
layers of bread and cheese. Beat two eggs in a pint of milk, pour over 
the bread and cheese, and bake in a hot oven. This will serve six per- 
sons. 

Spanish Rabbit. — To a cupful of grated cheese add two-thirds the 
quantity of minced onion, which is first cooked in boiling water. Drain 
and add milk almost to cover the onions ; season with salt and pepper 
and when the milk is hot put in the cheese. As soon as the cheese is 
melted stir in one well-beaten egg. Cook a moment longer and serve. 



388 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Cheese Ramekins. — Two ounces of bread crumbs boiled in one gill 
of milk; to this add four tablespoonfuls of grated cheese, two of melted 
butter, and stir over the fire until blended. Take off and add the beaten 
yolks of two eggs, salt and pepper to taste. Beat the whites of three 
eggs stiff, stir carefully into the mixture, and bake 15 minutes in a quick 
oven. 

Cheese Souffle.— Put two tablespoonfuls of butter in a saucepan; when 
it melts add one heaping tab'.espoonful of flour, stir until smooth; add a 
half-cup of jnilk, a saltspoonful of salt and a saltspoonful of paprika; 
cook two minutes; add the well-beaten yolks of three eggs and one cup 
of grated cheese, but take it off the fire just before adding them, and 
when you stir them all in well set it away to cool. When cold add the 
stiflly beaten whites of the eggs, turn into a buttered dish and place im- 
mediately in the oven and bake 25 or 30 minutes. Have a folded napkin 
ready to wrap around the dish and serve it immediately, or it will fall. 

Cheese Sticks. — Mix together one pint grated cheese, one pint flour, 
one tablespoon butter, two scant teaspoons baking powder, a little salt 
and a dash of pepper. Mix with milk or water and roll thin like pie 
crust. Cut into strips four or five inches long and nearly an inch wide. 
Bake in a quick oven. 

Cheese Straws. — One cupful of grated cheese and one tablespoonful of 
butler creamed together; two slices of bread, without crust, dried in oven 
and rolled fine. Four tablespoonfuls of cold water, pinch of salt, dust 
of red pepper, and flour enough to roll out. Cut in strips and bake a 
delicate brown. 

Cheese Toast. — Grate a cupful of cheese, and lightly mix in a heaping 
saltspoonful of mustard, a half-saltspoonful of salt and a speck of cay- 
enne. Heap this on thin strips or triangles of buttered toast, place them 
in a hot oven for a few moments, and serve as soon as the cheese begins 
to melt. Any kind of a thin cracker may be used instead, and a dusting 
of paprika over each piece in place of the cayenne. 

Welsh Custards. — One cupful of dry grated cheese, four eggs, one cup- 
ful of milk, one teaspoon ful of butter, two of flour, mixed with milk, a 
bit of soda size of pea, half -i teaspoonful of salt and a pinch of cayenne. 
Heat the milk, stirring in the soda, butter, salt and pepper, and the flottr 
mixture, and pour scalding hot on the eggs beaten light in a bowl. Add 
the cheese, beat up for a minute, pour into buttered custard cups and 
bake in a brisk oven for 20 minutes. They should be served instantly. 



CHAPTER XV. 

WARM SUPPER AND BREAKFAST DISHRS. 

Anchovy Toast.— Tcast a small round of bread for each person, butter 
and put in vegetable dish. Make a sauce of one pint of milk and two 
tablespoonfuls of flour; when thickened add level saltspoonful of salt, 
dash of cajenne and three teaspoonfuls of anchovy essence or five 
anchovies boned and pounded. Pour over the toast; serve hot. 

Arrowroot Cream Toast.- -First put into a double boiler a scant pint 
of rich milk and a teacupful of cream; let it come to the boiling point, 
then add a large tablespoonful of fresh butter and a tablespoonful of 
arrowroot wetted in a little milk or cream; season to taste with salt, and 
lot- it boil up. Toast light slices of bread, browning evenly. Put two 
slices at a time into the sauce, and as soon as they soften all through, 
which will only take a short time, put in a covered dish kept hot. Pour 
a little sauce over each layer, and serve the toast while very hot. 

Golden Cream Toast.— Cut slices of stale bread into diamonds and 
toast to a pale brown, drying slightly in the oven before browning. Make 
a rich white sauce of a pint of milk, three tablespoonfuls of butter, two 
tablespoonfuls of flour, half a teaspoonful of salt, a dusting of mace and 
a light dusting of pepper. Cook until smooth, add the grated yolks 
of three hard-boiled eggs and pour over the toasted bread. 

Baked Toast. — Prepare toast in the ordinary way, and, as each slice 
is ready, dip quickly into a pan of boiling water slightly salted, then 
pack into a baking dish, sprinkle well with salt, and cover deep with 
boiling milk. Bake in a dish, closely covered, for 15 minutes, and serve. 
The toast should have absorbed all the liquid without getting dry. If 
you can spare three or four tablespoonfuls of cream, heat, and pour over 
the surface just before sending to the table. The baking lends smooth- 
ness and richness to this dish not to be found in milk toast prepared in 
the usual way. 

Bread Croquettes. — Rub the inside of a loaf of stale bread through 
a colander, then measure. To one good quart add one pint of milk and 
heat over the fire in a double boiler. As soon as it reaches the scalding 
point take it oflf, let stand for a moment, then add one-half of a cupful 
of cleaned currants, two tablespoonfuls of chopped citron, one-half of a 
teaspoonful of cinnamon, two tablespoonfuls of chopped almonds and 
the beaten yolks of two raw eggs. Return to the fire and stir and cook 
for two minutes, then turn out on a greased dish and set aside until cold. 
Form carefully into small cylinders, dip each in egg, roll in fine dried 
crumbs and fry golden brown in hot fat. Serve with a foamy sauce. 



190 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Cheese Pie. — Cut bread into one-third inch slices, cutting each slice in 
half. Butter a shallow baking dish, put in a layer of bread, then a layer 
of soft mild cheese, cut in one-eighth inch slices, and sprinkled with salt 
and paprika or pepper. Beat two eggs slightly and add one cup of milk. 
Pour over the bread and bake until the cheese is soft, which will take 
about 30 minutes. 

Hulled Corn au Gratin. — For one quart of hulled corn prepare a pint 
of rich cream sauce, flavoring it with Worcestershire sauce or other 
condiments to make it piquant. Put the sauce and corn in a baking dish 
or individual ramekins in alternate layers, sprinkle the top with grated 
cheese and a dusting of paprika, and bake until well browned on top. 

Noodles. — Beat an egg slightly, but not until it foams ; salt it to 
season the dough, and then work in all the flour the egg can be made 
to take up. Take the dough on to the board and knead in flour until it 
is stiff and smooth, then roll out as thin as possible. Let the sheet of 
dough dry for a while, but roll it into a roll like a jelly roll before it 
gets dry enough to break when rolled; slice from the end, and shake into 
strings. The thinner the dough is rolled, and the finer it is cut the better 
the noodles are. A very thin, sharp knife makes the work of cutting 
much easier and insures much finer noodles. The directions given call 
for one egg as a basis, but the method of making is exactly the same if 
six, or a dozen eggs are used. Three medium-sized eggs will make a 
sheet of dough 30 inches square if properly rolled out, and will be 
enough for a family of six or eight 'hungry people. When dry enough 
to roll and cut, the noodles are dry enough to cook, but they may be kept 
for hours or days, after they are cut. 

Cheese Noodles. — Make your noodles the day before you want to use 
them and shave fine. Drop lightly into boiling water and allow them to 
cook 15 minutes over a hot fire. Do not let them simmer, or they will 
turn out a mushy mass. Drain and fill a rather deep pan to the depth 
of two inches. Season with salt and pepper and pour over them enough 
sweet milk almost to cover. Over the top grate cheese to the depth of 
half an inch, cover and bake one hour, removing cover the last 15 min- 
utes unless oven is too hot. 

Rice Croquettes. — To one teacupful of boiled rice, add one teaspoonful 
of butter, a beaten egg, a seasoning of salt and pepper, and mix well to- 
gether. Mold into rolls, or small cakes, dip into egg, and then into pow- 
dered cracker crumbs and fry in hot butter or drippings. A little finely 
chopped cold meat is an improvement; it should be mixed with the rice 
and egg before molding. 

Rice Muffins.— One pint of milk, one pint boiled rice, two eggs, two table- 
spoonfuls of suga::, one tablespoonful of butter, one teaspoonful each of 
salt and baking powder. Beat the sugar, salt, yolks of eggs and butter 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 191 

together, add the milk and sufficient flour to make a thin batter; sift the 
rice in lightly, and last the beaten whites. Bake in rings 30 minutes. 

Royal Toast. — Put bread toasted a delicate brown in a square shallow 
pan; put a piece of butter the size of a walnut on each slice, and sprinkle 
with sugar. Arrange in layers, and pour over the whole enough milk 
or cream to half fill the pan. Cover closely and set in a slow oven until 
the liquid is all absorbed. 

Swiss Toast. — Mash one-half box of berries, but not too fine; sweeten 
one-quarter cup of sugar, then cut five slices of stale bread as for toast- 
ing. Cover each slice with the berries. Retain some of the juice so as 
not to make the bread too soft. Heat about two tablespoonfuls of but- 
ter in a large frying pan ; put the slices with the berries on them carefully 
into the hot butter and fry slowly until the bread is browned on the un- 
derside, basting the berries with the butter while in the pan. Transfer the 
bread and berries to a hot platter; pour the rest of the juice over them 
and serve immediately. 

Tomato Toast. — This can often be made from stewed or scalloped to- 
matoes left over from dinner; the extra juice from canned tomatoes 
which often makes them seem too. watery, is useful for the toast. The 
tomato is simmered with the proper flavoring, strained through a sieve, 
and then thickened with flour and butter before being poured over the 
toast. If one wishes to make more of a dish, crisp fried bacon may be 
served with it, or a spoonful of minced ham or other cooked meat may 
be put on the top of each piece of toast before the tomato is pou'red 
over it. 

Creamed Tomatoes. — Peel several tomatoes and cut them in moderately 
thick slices. Fry them in butter, seasoning them as they are frying with 
pepper and salt. Remove them carefully to a platter, leaving the shreds 
of the tomatoes that have fallen ofif. Pour into the pan about three- 
quarters of a cup of rich milk and thicken with flour. Pour this sauce 
over the tomatoes. 

Blueberry Pancakes.— Sift one scant pint of flour with one teaspoonful 
of baking powder and a half-teaspoonful of salt. Mix two well-beaten 
eggs with 2^ cupfuls of sweet milk and thoroughly blend all together. 
Grease the griddle, drop the batter on in large spoonfuls and spread a 
teaspoonful of blueberries on each, pressing into the cake. Turn, and 
when brown serve with butter and powdered sugar. 

Buckwheat Cakes. — One pint milk scalded and cooled, one-half tea- 
spoonful salt. When lukewarm add one-fourth of a yeast cake which has 
been dissolved in a little warm water; one cup buckwheat flour and one 
cup white flour. Let rise over night. In the morning stir in one-fourth 
teaspoonful of soda and one tablespoonful molasses. Beat vigorously 
before cooking. 

Mixed Buckwheat Cakes.— Sift together two cupfuls of buckwheat, 



192 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

one cupful of rolled oats, one cupful of cornmeal, one scant teaspoonful 
of salt. Mix to a pour batter, with equal parts of milk and water, add 
one-third of a cake of compressed yeast, cover and stand in a warm 
place over night; before baking add one-third of a teaspoonful of soda 
dissolved in hot water. These are good and easy of digestion. 

Crumb Croquettes. — Melt a tablespoonful of butter in a frying pan 
and add a tablespoonful of flour; a cupful of sweet milk, and salt and 
pepper to season. Cook until it thickens, then add one beaten egg. Re- 
move from the fire and mix in bread crumbs until the mixture is thick. 
Make into balls and let get cold. Roll in egg and crumbs ; fry in deep 
fat like other croquettes. 

Crumb Pancakes. — Two cupfuls sour milk, one-half teaspoonful soda, 
two cupfuls stale bread crumbs, two eggs, two cupfuls. flour, two level 
tcaspoonfuls baking powder, pinch of salt. Soak bread crumbs in the 
ra'lk over night, add dissolved soda ; if one has stale Johnny cake a 
change may be made by using one cupful bread crumbs and one cupful 
Johnny cake crumbs. In the morning add the eggs, well beaten, then sift 
in the flour and baking powder. It may be that two cupfuls of flour 
will not be needed to make a suitable batter; use just enough. 

French Pancakes. — Beat five eggs very light, add two tablespoonfuls 
of melted butter, one and one-half pints of milk, and enough wheat 
flour, sifted with two tcaspoonfuls of baking powder, to make a good 
batter. About a quart of flour will be needed. Melt a little butter in a 
large frying pan, and pour the batter into this. When brown on one 
side, turn carefully and brown on the other. When done, spread quickly . 
with fruit jelly, and roll up as you would a sheet of music. Transfer 
carefully to a very hot dish, sprinkle with powdered sugar, or with pow- 
dered sugar and ground cinnamon, and serve immediately. 

Flannel Cakes. — One cupful of Indian meal, two cupfuls of flour, three 
of boiling milk, one-fourth of a yeast cake, one teaspoonful of salt, two 
tablespoonfuls of butter and one of sugar. Pour the boiling milk upon 
the meal and butter; let it cool; then add the flour, salt, sugar and the 
portion of yeast dissolved in four tablespoonfuls of cold water. Let it 
rise over night, and in the morning fry as you would griddle cakes. 

Yeast Flannel Cakes. — Heat a half-pint of sweet milk and into it put 
one heaping tablespoonful butter, let it melt, add a half pint cold mi.k 
and the well beaten yolks of two eggs, a half teaspoonful of salt, two 
tablespoonfuls homemade yeast, and flour to make -a stiff batter. Let 
rise in a warm place over night. Before baking add the beaten whites, 
which have been kept in a cool place during the night. Be sure to make 
batter stiff enough, as flour must not be added after it has risen. These 
cakes, half cornmeal and half wheat, are very nice.

PREFACE 



For many years The R. N.-Y. has been collecting tested recipes from 
an immense army of practical housewives. Some are entirely original ; 
others are doubtless modifications of familiar practice. It is an easy 
matter to mislay a recipe not needed for immediate use, and we are thus 
often asked to repeat their publication, not once, but perhaps a dozen 
times. For this reason it seemed wise to print a selection of these recipes 
in permanent form, and "The Rural Cook Book" was decided upon, as 
a successor to "The Business Hen'' and "The Farmer's Garden." Before 
we had finished assembling our material, however, we discovered that we 
had enough recipes alone to fill four books of the required size, and the 
question became not what to put in, but what to leave out. It was decided 
that we must give as much space as possible to canning, preserving, 
pickling, and other uses of fruit and vegetables, as such recipes are 
especially useful to farm housekeepers. This little book is not intended, 
however, to be a complete guide to domestic economy ; in spite of its 
omissions we feel sure that it will be found a real practical helper, and 
we also think it will fill a place left vacant by many a more pretentious 
volume.

CHAPTER I. 

SOUPS. 

Here are some certain rules of health; 

Take them — they're better far than wealth : 

Don't overeat, don't overdrink, 

Don't overvrork, don't overthlnk, 

Be not afraid of honest svpeat ; 

Run like a deer from shame and debt. 

Beware of bigness of the head. 

Get bigness of the soul Instead. 

Almond and Celery Soup. — Cut in small pieces a bunch of celery, 
using the leaves and carefully scraped root; add six peppercorns, two 
bay leaves, a tablespoonful of onion juice, a thin slice of lemon, a tea- 
spoonful of salt, and a stick of cinnamon; cover with a quart of water 
and cook an hour, strain and reheat, stirring in a cup of rich milk (cream 
is better), a teaspoonful each of flour and butter blended together, and 
one-quarter of a cup of blanched almonds that have been pounded to a 
paste, allowing soup to boil for a moment or two after the nuts are 
added. Serve very hot with cheese crackers. 

English Beef Soup. — Take the cracked joints of beef, and after put- 
ting the meat in the pot and covering it well with water let it come 
to a boil, when it should be well skimmed. Set the pot where the meat 
will simmer slowly until it is thoroughly done, keeping it closely cov- 
ered all the time. The next day, or when cold, remove the fat which 
hardens on the top of the soup. Peel, wash and slice three good-sized 
potatoes and put them inta the soup; cut np half a head of white cab- 
bage in shreds and add to this a pint of Shaker corn that has been 
soaked over night, two onions, one head of celery, and tomatoes, if de- 
sired. When these are done, and they should simmer slowly, care being 
taken that they do not burn, strain (or not, as preferred) the soup and 
serve. The different varieties of beef soup are formed by this method 
of seasoning and the different vegetables used in preparing it after the 
joints have been well boiled. Besides onions, celery, cabbage, tomatoes 
and potatoes, many use a few carrots, turnips, beets and force-meat balls, 
seasoned with spice. Rice or barley will give the soup consistency, and 
are to be preferred to flour for the purpose. Parsley, thyme and sage 
are the favorite herbs for seasoning, but should be used sparingly. To 
make force-meat balls add to one pound chopped beef one egg, a small 
lump of butter, a cup or less of bread crumbs; season with salt and 
pepper and moisten with water from stewed meat; make in balls and

fry brown, or make egg-balls by boiling eggs, mashing the yolks with a 
silver spoon and mixing with one raw yolk and one teaspoonful of flour; 
season with salt and pepper, make into balls; drop in soup just before 
serving. 

Black Bean or Lentil Soup. — Soak a pint of black beans or lentils over 
night. In the morning, parboil them. Boil gently in fresh water until 
soft enough to rub through a sieve. Add a bay leaf, some cloves, and 
a stalk of celery. Brown two slices of bacon cut in dice with half a 
minced onion and turn into the soup. Serve with squares of toast. 

Brown Flour Soup. — Put a lump of butter into a clean iron frying 
pan. When melted, sprinkle in half a cupful of flour and stir briskly 
until the flour is of a imiform brown color like roasted coffee. Add this 
gradually to two quarts of water. Peel and cut into cubes three pota- 
toes and cook in the soup 30 minutes. Season with an onion and a tea- 
spoonful of celery salt. 

Consomme. — Cut up two pounds of lean raw meat, beef or veal, and 
add a cupful of cold roast beef, cut in pieces. Put over the fire with a 
cracked knuckle of veal, four quarts of cold water, two onions, one 
carrot, two stalks of celery, six peppercorns, a spoonful of salt, six 
cloves and a few herbs. Cook slowly all day. Strain, and when cold 
skim off the fat. Add the white and shells of two eggs. Bring to a 
boil and boil 10 minutes. Strain through a cloth. 

Com Chowder. — Pare and slice thin onions enough to make a pint; 
boil one hour; to this add one-half pint potatoes cut small, boil 10 
minutes longer. Fry brown a slice of fat salt pork cut small and add 
fat and all, then a pint of tender sweet corn (canned corn is all right). 
Boil 10. minutes longer; the whole of this now should be two quarts or 
more; this is the best time to salt and pepper to taste. Add one pint 
of milk and a cupful of cream or a piece of butter as large as an egg if 
cream is not plentiful. Do not let cream boil; serve very hot. 

Cream of Corn Soup. — Scrape the corn from eight tender young 
ears. Boil the cobs in as little water as may be for 30 minutes. Strain 
ofl the liquid, add the scraped corn and boil 20 minutes. Heat one quart 
of sweet milk to scalding point; rub togetlier one tablespoonful butter 
and one teaspoonful flour; stir into the hot milk. Add one-half tea- 
spoonful salt, one-quarter teaspoonful white pepper. Pour over the corn, 
stir for a minute or two, then pour into hot tureen. Serve with crou- 
tons. Croutons — Cut bread two days old into small triangles or dice. 
Brown in oven to a golden tint. They are very nice spread with a paste 
made of twice the quantity of butter cream.ed, of delicate cheese grated 
and a little finely chopped parsley. (Two teaspoons butter, one of grated 
cheese, one-fourth teaspoon chopped parsley). The croutons can be 
fried if desired.

Cream of Eggs. — Slice a medium-sized onion into a quart of milk 
and bring the milk to the scalding point in a double boiler. Strain 
out the onion and return the milk to the kettle with a teaspoonful of 
flour that has been rubbed to a paste with the same quantity of butter. 
Stir to a smooth cream-like soup, and just before serving season with 
one teaspoonful of salt and three shakes of pepper. Chop coarsely, the 
white of four or five hard-boiled eggs and add to the soup. When 
ready to serve sprinkle each portion with the grated yolks. 

Cream of Salsify. — Take two bunches of salsify, wash, scrape and cut 
in small pieces and boil until tender. While hot mash and press through 
a colander. Have ready a cream made of two tablespoons of flour and 
two of butter melted together, seasoned with one-half saltspoonful white 
pepper and stirred into three cups milk and one cup water, which have 
previously been brought to a boil. Stir constantly until the consistency 
of a puree; add the prepared salsify, let boil up once, add three-quarters 
of a teaspoonful salt, and serve immediately. 

Fish Chowder. — Two pounds of fresh cod or any white fish, a quar- 
ter-pound bacon, four large potatoes, one small onion, half a can tomatoes, 
one quart milk, butter the size of a walnut, and a teaspoonful of flour 
for thickening. Pick the fish to pieces, removing all bone and skin; 
peel potatoes and cut into dice ; cut the bacon in small pieces ; rub the 
butter and flour to a cream. On the bottom of a granite kettle spread 
half of the potatoes in a layer, then half of fish, then sprinkle in the 
onions minced fine, then the bacon, then half the tomatoes. Then a 
shake of salt and pepper; add the rest of the fish, potatoes, tomatoes and 
more salt and pepper, using in all one teaspoonful salt and one-half tea- 
spoonful pepper. Cover with water, let simmer for half an hour. Let 
the milk come to a scald, put a pinch of soda into the chowder and stir; 
add the hot milk to the butter and flour; stir smooth; then add to the 
chowder; let get very hot, and serve. 

Milk Soup. — The various soups known as creams are usually about 
half milk and half meat or vegetable stock, slightly thickened with flour 
which has been blended with fat. For example, the tough, flabby portions 
and white leaves of a bunch of celery might be cut in small pieces, mixed 
with a sliced onion, covered with cold water and cooked until much of it 
can be rubbed through a strainer. To this juice and pulp is added an 
equal portion or even more of hot milk. For thickening a quart of soup 
slightly, one ounce of butter and one rounding tablespoonful of flour 
should be cooked together in a small saucepan until frothing, then add a 
little of the soup and beat until smooth, and then mix with the whole 
Season with salt and pepper. For a thicker soup use twice as much 
flour and butter, though the butter may be decreased slightly. However, 
if we use skim-milk for the soup, as we may, the increase of butter is 



10 THE RUrAl cook BOOK. 

desirable. Such soups can be made from almost any vegetable, varying 
the thickening according to the thickness of the pulp of the vegetables. 
Bean and pea soup require less flour, but a little will keep them from 
becoming watery on top. A corn chowder can be made much like a 
fish chowder from fresh or canned corn with pork fat, onion and po- 
tato. Such soups are excellent for supper on a cold night, and give an 
opportunity to turn skim-milk to good account. 

Mock Oyster Soup. — Scrape a dozen roots of salsify, throwing at once 
into cold water to avoid discoloring, cut into thin slices and cover with 
a quart of water, or preferably soup stock. Cook gently until perfectly 
tender (about an hour) ; then add a quart of milk, a teaspoonful of salt, 
one-fourth teaspoonful of pepper, and two tablespoonfuls of butter cut 
into bits. Serve with oyster crackers. 

Italian Onion Soup. — Boil six young but fully grown onions in two 
waters, turning off the first at the end of 10 minutes' boil, and replac- 
ing with fresh hot water. There should be a quart of the second water. 
When the onions are tender, add a cupful of dry, fine bread crumbs and 
cook gently for five minutes more. Pour the contents of the kettle into 
a colander and rub the onions and crumbs through it into the liquid in 
the bowl below. Return all to the fire, simmer for a minute and stir into 
the soup a "roux," made by heating to a bubbling cream a great spoon- 
ful of butter with one of flour in a frying pan. Have ready heated in 
another saucepan a cup of milk in which you have dropped a pinch of 
soda. Take the boiling soup from the fire, stir in the hot milk, and pour 
into a heated tureen. Pass Parmesan cheese with it. 

Cream of Oyster Soup. — ^Add to one quart of milk half of a small 
onion, two sprigs of parsley and a half a cupful of celery leaves and 
stalks. Scald in a double boiler. Mix one-fourth of a cupful of flour 
with sufficient cold milk to make a paste and add it to the scalded milk. 
Stir until it thickens and let cook for about 20 minutes covered. Pour 
a cupful of cold water over a quart of oysters, strain the liquid through 
a cheesecloth and heat to a boiling point. Add the oysters and when the 
boiling point is reached add the thickened milk. Season with salt and 
white pepper and stir in, little by little, one-fourth of a cup of butter. 

Pink Velvet Soup. — Half a canful of tomatoes, one pint of water, 
one tablespoonful of butter, one large onion, chopped small ; one potato 
shaved thin, a saltspoonful of celery seed, a teaspoonful of salt, a table- 
spoonful of sugar and a pinch of sweet marjoram. Boil all together 
for half an hour, or until the potatoes melt. Strain, thicken with gran- 
ulated tapioca or cornstarch, boil five minutes, add a pinch of baking soda, 
and then pour in a pint of hot milk. Serve at once. 

Potato Soup. — Three potatoes, one pint milk, one teaspoonful chopped 
onions, one stalk celery, one teaspoonful salt, one teaspoonful celery salt, 



THE RURAL CdOK BOOK. 11 

one-half saltspoonful white pepper, one-fourth saltspoonful cayenne, one- 
half tablespoonful flour, one tablespoonful butter. Pare the potatoes 
and soak them in cold water one-half hour. Boil them until very soft. 
Cook onions and celery in milk in double boiler. When potatoes are 
soft drain and mash, add boiling milk and seasoning. Rub through 
strainer and put on to boil again. Melt butter in small saucepan; when 
bubbling add flour; when well mixed stir into boiling soup. Boil five 
minutes and serve very hot. This flour thickening prevents milk and 
potato from separating, and gives a smoothness quite unlike granular 
effects often noticed. If too thick add hot milk. The soup may also be 
made with meat stock instead of milk. 

Salmon Bisque. — One pint of oyster liquor and one of hot water 
heated together. When it boils stir in two cupfuls of finely minced 
salmon, seasoning with pepper, salt and a little chopped parsley. In an- 
other saucepan put one cupful of milk and heat to scalding, with a pinch 
of soda ; stir into this two tablespoonfuls of butter, rubbed with one 
tablespoonful of flour and a half cupful of pounded cracker. Add one 
egg well beaten and stir and cook for a moment. Mix the fish and 
milk mixtures, cook a few moments, pour into soup tureen and . serve 
hot. 

Scotch Broth. — One-half cup pearl barley, two pounds neck of mutton, 
two quarts cold water, one-fourth cup each of turnip, carrot, onion and 
celery chopped small, two tablespoons butter, one tablespoon flour, two 
teaspoonfuls salt, one saltspoon parsley chopped fine. Soak barley over 
night. Remove fat and skin from mutton, scrape meat from bones and 
cut in dice. Put bones on to boil in one pint cold water, the meat in 
separate pot with three pints water. Let the latter cook quickly. Skim 
when it begins to boil; add barley; skim again. Fry the chopped vege- 
tables in the hot butter five minutes, drain, add to the meat, simmer 
three hours. Strain the water in which the bones were simmered, set 
aside for a moment. Put in the saucepan the butter left from frying 
the vegetables, melt and add the flour. When smooth, pour in gradually 
the liquid from the bones. Add to the broth, add salt, parsley and one- 
half saltspoon pepper, simmer 10 minutes and serve. As this broth is 
served without straining it is always well to boil bones separately. 

Split Pea Soup. — Wash a pint of split peas and cover with tepid 
water, adding a pinch of soda, and let remain over night to swell. In 
the morning put them in a kettle with three quarts of cold water, adding 
half a pound of lean salt pork cut into slices, also a teaspoonful of salt 
and a little pepper. Cook slowly for three hours, stirring occasionally 
till the peas are all dissolved, adding a little more boiling water to keep 
up the quantity as it boils away. Strain through a colander. Serve with 
small squares of toasted bread. 



18 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Squirrel Soup. — Allow one large or two small squirrels, well washed 
and jointed, to two quarts of cold water and two teaspoonfuls (level) 
of salt. Put to cook directly after breakfast in a stone pipkin or enam- 
eled kettle. Cover closely and set on the back of the range to simmer — 
not boil. After two hours add the corn from two ears, two small Irish 
potatoes, one-half cupful of Lima beans,- three sprigs of parsley, three 
celery stalks and one-half cupful of sliced' okra. Keep closely covered, 
and as the water evaporates add enough to keep the original two quarts. 
When the squirrels have cooked to rags strain through a coarse colander 
to remove the troublesome little bones. Return to the soup kettle, cover 
and continue to simmer until nearly time to serve. Then thicken with 
*• dessertspoonful of butter rolled in a dessertspoonful of fiour. Those 
who like may add a teaspoonful of powdered sassafras leaves. Have two 
slices of toast cut into inch squares, fried in butter and placed in the 
bottom of a hot tureen. Pour over them the soup, boiling hot, and 
serve immediately. 

Puree of Tomatoes. — Cook the contents of a can of tomatoes for 15 
minutes, then rub through a colander. Return to the fire and season with 
salt and pepper to taste, and a little sugar. Rub three tablespoonfuls of 
butter into one tablespoonful of cornstarch, and stir this smooth paste 
into the strained tomatoes. Cook, stirring steadily, until smooth and 
thick. Have ready heated in a saucepan a quart of rich milk into which 
has" been stirred a pinch of baking soda. To this add, gradually, the 
thickened tomato liquor, beating the milk constantly as you do so. 
Serve immediately, putting a great spoonful of unsweetened whipped 
cream on the surface of each plate of soup. 

Vegetable Cream Soups. — Scald three cupfuls of milk. Rub together 
one tablespoonful of butter and two tablespoonfuls of flour, cook until 
it bubbles ; add the hot milk gradually to this, and cook for five minutes, 
stirring until thick and smooth. Blend some of this cream with a cup- 
ful of cooked vegetable, mashed to a smooth pulp, mix all together, and 
simmer for five minutes, seasoning appropriately. Potato soup should 
have a little celery and onion cooked in the milk, and when ready to 
serve some finely-chopped parsley should be scattered on top. Celery, 
asparagus, green peas or beans, carrots, spinach, cucumbers and lettuce 
are all good in such soup; all must first be cooked and reduced to a 
smooth pulp. Bread cut into dice and browned "in butter is often added 
when the soup is ready to serve. 



CHAPTER ir. 



FISH. 



All small fish are best fried, and many large fish are excellent cooked 
it) the same way. The fish should be well cleaned; if small left whole, 
if large cut into neat pieces. Beat an egg with a tablespoonful of cold 
water; dip the fish in this, then roll in bread crumbs or cornmeal. Cook 
in plenty of fat, which must be boiling hot when put in. Baking and 
boiling are both excellent methods of cooking fish, but very soft fish 
should never be boiled. The recipes given below refer mainly to canned 
and salt fish, because these are more helpful in an emergency. 

Clam Chowder. — Take the liquor from fifty clams, put it on the stove 
to heat. Cut into dice yi pound salt pork, brown it in the frying pan, 
and add to the clam liquor. Peel and cut into dice three quarts of ripe 
tomatoes and half the quantity of potatoes. Cut up 50 clams, and let all 
the ingredients boil slowly for two or three hours. Half hour before 
serving add half a dozen large crackers rolled fine. 

Clam Gumbo. — In one large tablespoonful of lard fry one finely- 
chopped onion, add one cupful of chopped cooked ham, one tablespoonful- 
of chopped green pepper, four tomatoes, skinned and cut in pieces, one 
pint of okra, stemmed and sliced, one scant teaspoonful of salt and one 
quart of water or broth*. Simmer for an hour, add one dozen finely 
chopped clams, simmer 15 minutes, and serve. 

Clam Pie. — From a half pound of rather fat salt pork trim oft the 
rind and cut in slices, then in dice. Slowly fry this, and when the fat 
is well drawn out and just beginning to color add half of a small onion 
cut fine. When golden brown add one quart of raw, diced potatoes, 
one pint of boiling water and one-quarter of a teaspoonful of black pep- 
per. Cover and cook slowly until the potatoes are almost tender. Take 
from the fire, add one solid pint of raw clams cut in quarters and theii- 
strained juice. Turn into a deep well-greased baking dish. While this 
mixture is cooking mix and sift together one pint and a half of flour, 
a .half teaspoonful of salt and two teaspoonfuls of baking powder. 
Mix to a soft dough with sweet milk, and roll out not over a half inch 
thick. Cut in small round biscuits. Place these close together over the 
top of the pie, brush with milk and bake in a hot oven for 35 minutes. 

Roast Qams. — Wash the clams and drain them in a colander for a 
few minutes, then lay them in a large dripping pan and put the pan into 
a very hot oven. As soon as the shells begin to open, the clanu are 



14 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

cooked; it takes from seven to 10 minutes to roast them. Have a cov- 
ered dish hot, and drop the clams into it as soon as they are taken from 
the shell. Spread over them a mustard cream sauce and serve at once. 
To make the sauce: Put one cup of milk over the fire in a double 
boiler. When boiling, gradually stir into it three tablespoonfuls of but- 
ter, one of flour, and one teaspoonful of dry mustard that have been 
beaten to a creamy mass. Season with salt and pepper and return to the 
fire; cook three minutes, and it is ready to serve. Thin slices of brown 
bread, buttered, are served with roast clams. 

Baked Fish. — Bluefish, cod, or haddock are the best fish to bake. 
Clean the fish and make a stuffing as follows : Soak stale bread in cold 
water for 30 minutes. Press dry, and season with one egg, one table- 
spoonful melted butter and a small quantity of sage, or the prepared 
poultry dressing, or a little onion juice, as preferred. When the stuf- 
fing has been thoroughly mixed, fill the fish and sew up with needle and 
thread. Flour the fish well and salt it. Lay a few thin slices of salt pork 
into the bottom of the baking dish, also a few slices on top of the 
fish. Baste it often with the liquor which cooks out of it, adding a lit- 
tle water if there is not enough. Allow 15 minutes to the pound for 
bakmg fish. Have a moderate oven, as, if very hot, it will not cook 
well in the middle. 

New England Codfish. — Select a whole fish, and put it to soak in 
cold water over night; in the morning wash it clean and cut off the fins 
and tail. Cook the fish whole; if you have not got a fish kettle place it 
in a large milk pan partly filled with water. Cover the pan closely and 
set over a kettle of hot water. It will cook very "slowly in this way, say 
five or six hours, according to the size of the fish, but it will be done 
properly when ready for the table. Serve it whole, placing it on a hot 
platter. Indeed, one of the essentials of a good salt fish dinner is to 
have everything hot, not only the fish and vegetables, but plates and 
dishes as well. The dish on which your fish is served must be an ample 
one, and around the fish you will place a garnish of nicely sliced beets 
and carrots. With the fish you will serve pork scraps and egg sauce 
and boiled potatoes. The pork should be cut into dice and fried a rich 
brown. To make the egg sauce, take two eggs that have been boiled 
10 minutes, remove the shell, and cut into little pieces, placing them in 
the sauce dish. Blend a piece of butter the size of an egg with a table- 
spoonful of flour, and when the fish is ready to serve, pour over a coffee- 
cupful of boiling water, stir, and pour into the sauce dish with the egg 
and stir again. If the sauce is too thick, add still more boiling water. 
When you have not time to cook a salt fish for dinner and desire an 
emergency dish, try salt fish in cream prepared as follows: Shred a 
cupful of salt cod, or, if you prefer, use the prepared article, place it ia 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 15 

a stewpan over the fire in cold water to cover, and let it come to a boil 
for a couple of minutes ; pour off the water, add to the fish one pint 
of sweet milk, and when this boils thicken with flour wet with milk; 
let it boil four or five minutes, being careful it does not scorch, and 
serve in a hot, deep dish. Serve pickled beets with this dish, and boiled 
potatoes. 

Cuban Codfish. — Pick into fine shreds a cupful of freshened codfish. 
Cut an onion into thin slices and lightly brown in a saucepan with a 
tablespoonful of butter. Add the fish and pour in just enough water 
to cover. Add a part of a chopped green pepper and a hal'f can of to- 
matoes. Cover closely and simmer for an hour. If the tomatoes are 
very juicy, less water is required. Cream a rounded teaspoonful of but- 
ter and one of flour; stir into the fish until smooth and cooked; turn the 
mixture upon thin slices of buttered toast. 

Delicate Fishballs. — Boil the quantity of codfish that would be re- 
quired, changing the water once that it may not be too salt. While the 
fish is hot pick it very fine, so that it will be feathery. It cannot be done 
fine enough with a fork, and should be picked by hand. At the same 
time have hot boiled potatoes ready, mash them thoroughly and make 
them creamy with milk and a good-sized lump of butter. To three cup- 
fuls of mashed potatoes take lyi cupful of fish ; the fish should not. be 
packed down. Beat one egg lightly and stir into the other ingredients 
and season to taste. Beat the mixture well together and until light, then 
mold it into small balls, ' handling lightly and before frying roll the balls 
in flour. Fry them in smoking hot fat until a gold color. 

Mexican Codfish. — Fry to a pale yellow one small onion, chopped 
fine, in three tablespoonfuls of butter; add two tablespoonfuls of flour, 
half a green pepper, chopped fine, and one cupful of stewed and sifted 
tomato pulp. When the sauce reaches the boiling point, add half a 
pound of salt codfish, which has been freshened for 24 hours in cold 
water and slowly simmered until it will readily separate into flakes. 

Codfish Mound. — Make one quart of good mashed potatoes without 
any salt; add a pint of picked boiled codfish. Season with pepper; beat 
well together, make into a mound with a depression in center on a bak- 
ish dish, and set in the oven to brown. When brought to the table, pour 
a. few tablespoonfuls of cream sauce in center of mound, and garnish 
with hard-boiled egg. Serve with boiled beets and, if desired, salt pork 
or bacon cut into tiny squares and fried crisp, which, with the fat fried 
out, is poured into a gravy bowl. This makes a hearty and satisfying 
meal. 

Biscay Salt Cod. — Bone two pounds of salt cod and soak in cold 
water for 12 hours. Place in a saucepan, cover with salt water and let 
heat gradually to boiling point; then add fresh water and let boil again. 



16 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Take out and drain. Chop two onions and one green pepper quite fine 
and cook for five minutes in butter or oil. Add one sliced tomato or 
half-cupful of stewed tomatoes, one clove of garlic and a small chili 
pepper. Add to these three pints of broth, a small bunch of parsley, 
three tablespoonfuls of tomato catsup and a pint of small potatoes 
(peeled) or the same quantity of. potato balls. Cook until the potatoes 
are just done, add the cod and cook five minutes longer. 

Salt Codfish Chowder.— Cut one-fourth pound of salt pork into bits 
and try out the fat in a frying pan; in this brown two medium-sized 
onions, sliced. Wash and drain a pound of codfish, cut or picked into 
bits; cover with cold water and set on back of range to heat, but not 
boil. After two hours add a pint and a half of potatoes pared and sliced, 
and a dash of pepper. Add a cupful of water to the onions and pork 
and strain over the potatoes. When the potatoes are tender add one 
cupful each of scalded cream and milk. Pour the chowder over six 
crackers broken into halves and serve. 

Finnan Haddie, Caledonian Style. — Soak one-half of a finnan haddie 
weighing four pounds, two hours in milk and water to cover, using 
equal .parts, having the liquid at a uniformly even tepid temperature. 
This is best accomplished by having the fish in a drip pan on the back 
of the range. Trim the fish to fit a copper platter or graniteware drip- 
ping pan, by cutting off flank and a two-inch piece from the tail end. 
Pour over a cream sauce, and surround with six halves of potatoes of 
uniform size smoothly pared. Cook until the potatoes are soft, the time 
required being about 40 minutes, basting with the cream sauce three 
times during the cooking. Cream must enter into the composition of a 
real cream sauce. For the cream sauce for the finnan haddie, melt two 
tablespoonfuls of butter, add two tablespoonfuls of flour, and stir until 
well blended, then pour on gradually, while stirring constantly, one cupful 
of milk and one-half cupful of cream. Bring to the boiling point, and 
season with a few grains of pepper. No salt will be needed, for it must 
be remembered that finnan haddie is salted. 

Finnan Haddie in Cream.— Cover a pound of the fish with cold water 
and let come to a simmer, drain, then cut into moderate-sized pieces. In 
the meantime prepare a cream sauce made by melting a tablespoonful 
of butter to which is added a tablespoonful of flour, a scant saltspoonful 
of salt, a dash of cayenne, two teaspoonfuls of lemon juice and one-half 
cupful each of milk and cream. Add the pieces of fish, let the whole 
come to a boil and serve. This creamed fish is also very nice if put 
in a baking dish, covered with bread crumbs, and browned in the oven. 
Browned Salt Mackerel-. — ^Freshen two fish by soaking over night, 
wash in fresh water in the morning and squeeze over the flesh side the 
juice of one-half a lemon. Lay one of the fish skin side down in baking 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 17 

dish and cover with dressing made of one cupful bread crumbs, one table- 
spoonful butter (scant), pinch of pepper, a little grated lemon peel and 
one-fourth cupful of cream. Lay the other fish on dressing, skin side up, 
and baste well with hot water and melted butter. Put into a hot oveh 
for 20 minutes, then cover with bread crumbs, dot with bits of butter 
and put back in the oven till nicely browned. Carefully dish without 
disturbing the layers and serve with thin lemon slices and parsley as a 
garnish. 

Oyster Chowder. — Fry together two ounces of salt pork and one 
onion, sliced. Parboil one pint of sliced potatoes five minutes and drain. 
Look over carefully one pint of oysters, pour over one-half cupful of 
water and heat to the boiling point; skim out the oysters and pour the 
liquor over the potatoes, add the pork and onions and cook the potatoes 
until tender, adding a little more water if necessary; add the oysters, 
one pint of milk and one-half cupful of fine bread crumbs. Season with 
one teaspoonful of salt and half-teaspoonful of pepper and pour in the 
serving dish. 

Oyster Stew. — Put one quart of oysters in a colander, and pour over 
three-fourths of a cupful of cold water, reserving the liquor. Pick over 
the oysters, being careful that no particles of shells adhere to the tough 
muscles. Heat the reserved liquor to the boiling point, strain through a 
double thickness of cheese cloth, add the oysters, and cook, stirring oc- 
casionally, until the oysters are plump and the edges begin to curl. Re- 
move the oysters with a skimmer to a heated tureen, and add one-fourth 
of a cupful of butter, one-half tablespoonful of salt, one-eighth of a 
teaspoonful of pepper, the oyster liquor, strained a second time through 
a double thickness of cheese cloth, and four cupfuls of scalded milk. 

Baked Pickerel.^Clean the fish carefully and lay on a rack in a 
dripping pan; dredge with a teaspoonful of salt, several dashes of pepper, 
and a little flour. Bake carefully, basting every 10 minutes until well 
done, with hot water to which a tablespoonful of butter has been added! 
Make the sauce with half a cup of cream and half a cup of the basting 
liquid in which the fish was cooked; thicken with a teaspoonful of butter 
and a tablespoonful of flour; let the sauce boil up once, then add a ta- 
blespoonful of chopped parsley. Pour part of the sauce around the 
fish on a platter, and serve the remainder in a gravy boat. 

Quahaug Pie. — Remove the loose brown skin and black part from a 
quart of sea clams and chop the remainder fine. Scald a cup of milk, 
the liquid from the clams and enough water to make a pint in all, and 
thicken it with a tablespoonful each of flour and butter cooked to a 
smooth paste; then add pepper and salt to taste and two finely-chopped 
hard-boiled eggs, and lastly, the chopped clams. Line a meat pie dish 
with pie crust, then add a thin layer of cracker crumbs, the prepared 



18 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

clams, and sprinkle this over with another layer of cracker crumbs and 
cover with a good, rich crust, leaving several openings so the steam 
can escape. Bake about an hour in a hot oven until well browned. 

Salmon Chowder. — Chop coarsely and brown together in a kettle or 
saucepan, one-fourth pound of salt pork and one onion. Add one pint 
of raw potatoes, chopped or cut in dice, which have stood for half an 
hour in cold water. Season, barely cover with boiling water, and sim- 
mer for half an hour; then add a can of salmon, drained and flaked, 
two or three broken crackers and one pint of scalded milk or cream, 
with two teaspoons of butter. This may be varied by the addition of a 
can of tomatoes, or a shredded pepper or both. 

Creamed Salmon. — Put one tablespoonful of butter into a saucepan; 
when melted add one tablespoonful of flour, half a teaspoonful of salt, 
a dash of paprika and half a cup of milk. Cook until smooth, then add 
a small can of salmon finely minced, one tablespoonful lemon juice and 
a little grated nutmeg. Remove from the fire and add yolks of three 
eggs, well beaten; whip whites of the eggs stiff and fold in carefully. 
Butter small molds or a baking dish, place in hot water in a dripping 
pan and bake from 10 to 25 minutes. 

Escalloped Salmon. — Put one pint of milk to heat with a tablespoon- 
ful of butter. Moisten a table.spoonful of flour and stir in; when thick 
like cream remove from fire. Drain the liquid from the salmon and 
remove bone, pick it all up into fine pieces with a fork. Butter a bak- 
ish dish, put in a layer of fine cracker crumbs, then half the salmon, an- 
other layer of cracker crumbs, and half the thickened milk. Then add 
the remaining salmon, a layer of crumbs and the remaining milk. Bake 
half an hour. 

Salmon Loaf. — One can of salmon drained and minced. Five table- 
spoonfuls of butter, four eggs well beaten; half cup of bread crumbs, 
salt and pepper to taste. Mix all together, and steam one hour in but- 
tered mold. ! 

Fried Smelts. — Do not have the heads removed when the marketman 
cleans the fish. Wipe the outside of each with a damp cloth and then 
roll in Indian meal, then in beaten egg and then again into the meal; lay 
in a frying basket or place a few in a kettle of hot lard to cook until 
the coating is brown ; remove them and drain on to plain paper, and when 
serving arrange with garnishing of sliced lemon and parsley. If the 
basket is used place the fish side by side in it and drop into the kettle of 
hot lard until the fish are browned. 

Sportsman's Trout. — Take two fresh young trout, clean, wash and 
then wipe dry. Use one-half teaspoon of salt and two or three dashes 
of pepper over the fishes. Put in a pan to fit and fill to the level with 
cream. Bake a light brown, when the fish will have absorbed the cream. 



CHAPTER III. 

MEATS. 

I am the dinner table ; upon my ample breast 

Three times a day the housewife puts out her very best. 

Three times a day they gather — old grandpa at the head, 

Thrice daily otters up his thanks for life and daily bread. 

Then how the knives they clatter and how my load grows light, 

And how the housewife's goodly fare doth disappear from sight. 

I am the dinner table, and while my timbers stand 

I'll still remain headquarters for our good household band. 

Elaborate instructions for marketing are usually given under this head, 
but the farm housekeeper meets with different conditions. If meat is 
locally slaughtered it is likely to be much better in quality than that from 
the great packing centers. In pork particularly she has a great advantage 
over her town sisters. It should be remembered that in beef and mutton 
many of the cheaper and tougher cuts are nutritious and well flavored, 
but they need careful preparation, and especially long slow cooking. 
Tough meat should never be roasted, broiled or fried; it should be cooked 
gently in a closed vessel, with such seasonings as will best develop flavor. 
There are still some cooks who prepare meat hastily in slightly thickened 
water, and then wonder why the family dislikes stews. With long, slow 
cooking in a casserole or closed vessel, and a proper admixture of herbs 
and seasoning, the humble stew becomes a delicious ragout. 

Bacon, Cold Roast. — Select a square piece weighing three or four 
pounds, soak it over night. The next morning put it on to boil, allowing 
it to simmer very gently three-quarters of an hour to the pound; then 
let it go cool in the water in which it was cooked. When cold drain, 
remove the skin, rub the fat well with sugar, pour over it some cider 
vinegar, and roast in the oven until brown. When cold cut into thin 
slices; it should be tender and delicate in flavor. 

Beef, Braised. — Procure a piece of four pounds, make incisions in it 
an inch and a half apart, and stuff them with a dressing made of two 
tablespoonfuls of finely-minced onion, three tablespoonfuls of chopped 
parsley, a teaspoonful of sweet basil, a half teaspoonful of thyme, a half 
teaspoonful of pepper and two teaspoonfuls of salt. Dredge a table- 
spoonful of flour over the meat, lay three thin slices of bacon in the 
bottom of a deep pan, place the meat in, lay three more slices of bacon 
over the top, cover with a well-fitting lid and shut up in a moderate oven 
to brown. After it has been cooking for two hours add two carrots (or 
four small ones), one turnip, three stalks of celery, four salsifies and one

onion, all sliced. Add also three tablespoonfuls of tomato catsup, one 
minced green pepper, a teaspoonful of salt. If no green pepper is at 
hand use a few shreds of red pepper pod. A coffeecupful of boiling water 
should be added with the vegetables. Fit the cover on closely again and 
leave in the oven for another hour, or until both meat and vegetables are 
tender. To serve, place the meat on a hot platter and arrange the vege- 
tables by the spoonful about it; there should be just gravy enough to 
hold the vegetables together. 

Beef, Corned. — Here is an old home recipe for corning beef, which 
will be especially useful to those who kill their own beef cattle as well 
as pork. To every hundred pounds of beef take nine pounds of salt, four 
pounds of sugar or two quarts of good molasses, two ounces of soda, one 
ounce of saltpeter, and just enough water to cover the meat — about four 
or five gallons. Strew some salt over the bottom of a barrel; mix about 
half the amount of salt given with half the given amount of sugar or 
molasses, and rub each piece of meat thoroughly with it before placing it 
in the barrel. Dissolve the saltpeter and soda together in hot water, add 
the remainder of the salt and sugar and about four or five gallons of 
cold water. Pour this over the meat. Place a board on top of the meat, 
with a weight heavy enough to keep it under the brine. It may be kept 
an indefinite time in the brine, but is salt enough to cook after five or 
six days' corning. 

Spiced corned beef is made as follows, the recipe being an old one, 
we think of German origin: Rub twelve pounds of a round of beef with 
half a pound of coarse sugar. Let it stand for two days, turning it two 
or three times. Take a large teaspoonful of mace, a teaspoonful of black 
pepper, two of cloves, half a teaspoonful of cayenne, one small grated 
nutmeg, two ounces of juniper berries and one-half ounce of saltpeter. 
Stir all these seasonings together, adding a teaspoonful of sugar and rub 
the mixture thoroughly into the meat and all over it. Then let it stand 
for three days longer. At the end of this time rub half a pound of fine 
salt into the meat. Finally, let it stand for twelve days, rubbing the meat 
and turning it daily. If it is to be cooked immediately and not dried, wash 
it, but do not soak it. Lay it in a pot that just fits it, and pour over it a 
quart and a half of water. When it comes to the boiling point skim it 
carefully, add a carrot, a small onion, a bay leaf and a few sprigs of par- 
sley. Let it simmer very gently for four and a half hours. Take it from 
the fire, put it under a heavy weight and let it cool in the liquid in which 
it was cooked. Serve in thin slices when perfectly cold. 

Corned Beef, Shaker Style. — This recipe is given under the name of 
"bacca,'' in Good Housekeeping: Pound down close in a barrel 100 
pounds of the round of beef cut in 10-pound pieces, with a mixture of 
four pounds sugar, two ounces saltpeter, two ounces soda bicarbonate, and 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 21 

four quarts table salt sprinkled under, over and between. It will make 
brine without water. After one week, a piece of the top of the round, 
sliced and broiled, will be found tender and delicious. The bottom of 
the round, boiled till tender and sliced thin when cold, resembles ham, 
but is more choice in flavor. 

Corned Beef, Savory Style. — Choose a piece of brisket of corned beef 
weighing four to five pounds and about three times as long as wide ; 
wash, season with a small half teaspoonful of pepper, then roll it up and 
tie very tight. Put the beef in a kettle with cold water to cover, and 
lot slowly come to a boil, then pour it off and replace with more cold 
water to cover; add half a cupful of vinegar, a small onion, peeled, in 
which is inserted six cloves, half a red pepper, a blade of mace and a 
stalk of celery. Boil gently, allow half an hour to each pound. Serve hot. 
If the meat is preferred cold, it should be allowed to cool in the broth 
in which it was cooked. 

Curried Beef. — Melt in a saucepan two tablespoonfuls of butter, add 
two onions sliced, and fry until brown ; then add two tablespoonfuls of 
curry powder. Cut cold roast beef in pieces about an inch square, put it 
in the saucepan and add half a cupful of sweet milk. Simmer for 30 
minutes. Just before serving add the juice of a lemon. Send to the 
table on a platter bordered with boiled rice. 

Beef Loaf. — Take two pounds of round steak and half a pound of 
suet, both chopped fine; add two eggs, one cupful of bread crumbs that 
have been softened in cold water, one small onion, chopped fine, one-half 
cupful of sweet milk 1>4 teaspoonful of salt, and a fourth of a tea- 
spoonful of pepper; mix all together and shape into a loaf, put in a roast- 
ing pan and bake in a moderate oven 3>^ hours, baste frequently; serve 
with tomato sauce. 

Beefsteak Chowder. — Cut a pound and one-half of round steak in strips 
or cubes. Cut three or four ounces of fat pork in small pieces and cook 
in a hot frying pan with an onion sliced very thin. When both are 
browned add a quart of boiling water, simmer five minutes, pour the 
whole over the steak, bring to the boiling point, boil for five minutes and 
then cook slowly until the meat is tender. Have ready five large potatoes 
peeled, sliced, scalded in boiling water, drained and rinsed in cold water. 
Add the potatoes, one teaspoonful of salt and saltspoonful of pepper. 
Cook until the potatoes are lender, then add one and one-half cupful of 
rich milk and a little more salt if necessary. Heat to the boiling point 
and pour over pilot biscuit or thick crackers which have been dipped for 
a second in hot water. 

English Beefsteak Pudding. — Make a crust by thoroughly mixing two 
cupfuls of finely-chopped beef suet in three cupfuls of flour; add half 
teaspoonful of salt, and mix with cold water into a dough with the con- 



22 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

sistency of biscuit. Roll out the paste to the thickness of half an inch. 
Butter an earthen pudding bowl, and line with the paste. Take flank or 
round steak, cut into one-inch pieces, season with pepper and salt, and 
fill the dish. Pour in as much cold water as will find its way in around 
the meat, then cover it with paste, having moistened the edges to make 
them stick together. Cover with a cloth, well floured, leaving a little 
room for the pudding to swell. Put it into a pot of boiling water, and 
let it boil three hours, or put it in a steamer, and allow four hours' 
cooking. When fully cooked the meat should be very tender, with an 
abundance of rich clotted gravy. The addition of a few oysters with 
the meat forms a palatable change. Serve with boiled carrots and turnips. 

Spiced Beef. — This makes a desirable cold dish for luncheon or tea, 
or for Sunday dinner in Summer. Select a piece of the flank, trim off 
the coarse skin, lay it flat on the table, and, with a knife, spread over it 
the following mixture : One teaspoonful ground mustard, one teaspoonful 
celery salt, half teaspoonful black pepper, pinch of red pepper, mixed to 
a smooth paste with vinegar. Then roll up the meat like a jelly cake, the 
spice inside, tie it up, tie it in a cloth like a pudding. Put it into boiling 
water, and let it boil 2J/2 hours. When cooked lift the kettle off the 
stove, and allow the water to cool before removing the meat. Do not 
lake the cloth off until cold, then slice the meat for serving. 

Waverly Collared Beef. — Corn a six-pound piece of the thick part of 
the brisket by putting it in brine strong enough to float an egg, to which 
is added a heaping teaspoonful of saltpeter, one of brown sugar and a 
saltspoon of red pepper. Leave it in five or six days in Summer; eight 
or 10 in Winter. Use an earthen crock, and turn the meat every two or 
three days. Grate two large carrots, a good-sized stick of horseradish, 
and chop fine a large bunch of parsley; mix all together, and spread a 
thick layer on the corned beef, keeping it well to the middle, as it presses 
out when you roll; if the meat is not long, and difficult to roll nicely, cut 
a few pockets in it and fill with the dressing; then roll very tightly, 
fa-stening with skewers and bmding with strong string round and round. 
Any of the dressing that has squeezed out press back into the open ends 
of the roll ; remove the skewers ; then tie up in cheesecloth, cover with 
cold water, bring slowly to a simmer, and let it cook at this point four 
hours. Remove the cheesecloth, put the meat on a tray, place a heavy 
weight on it and leave it over night. Cut off the string. Serve cold, 
cutting thin slices off the end, showing the dressing. 

Brown Stew. — A piece of tough steak can be very well cooked in this 
way: Brown a tablespoonful of sugar in the kettle and add a sliced 
onion ; when brown cool and add for each pound of beef cut in small bits 
s tablespoonful of flour and one of butter or suet. Add a pint of boiling 
water, stir well and add the bits of meat. Put in half of a bay leaf or a 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 88 

pinch of celery seed. Cook very slowly for an hour. Just before serving 
add a teaspoonful of salt. The meat will be tender, the flavor excellent. 
The browned sugar, or caramel, as cooks call it, does not give a percep- 
tibly sweet flavor, but gives ? different taste, and makes brown gravy. 

Brunswick Stew. — Stew a large fowl until the meat leaves the bone; ' 
remove skin, gristle and bones and chop the meat in coarse pieces. Return 
to the liquor; add a pint of corn scraped from the ears, a pint of young 
Lima beans, three cupfuls of tomato, a good-sized onion, minced fine, a 
pint of young okras, a small red pepper, minced, a little celery seed, two 
tablespoonfuls of butter and salt, pepper and Worcestershire sauce to 
taste. Simmer until okra is tender and then serve. The addition of n 
little paprika just before the stew is taken up improves it greatly. 

Belgian Hare. — If you broil see that the hares are young, under four 
or five mouths, and therefore tender. After a brief soaking in water into 
which no soda or salt has been put (if the hares are young they have 
no unpalatable flavor and consequently great care must be taken to pre- 
serve their natural delicacy), dry well with a clean cloth, and gash them 
down the back through the thickest portion; then flatten each, place it 
on a gridiron, and broil it over a bed of coals, turning often, or you may 
lay them smooth on the bottom of a dripping pan and cook in a hot 
oven without basting; oil the pan slightly with a little sweet dripping, 
or a bit of fresh butter; they should be done in half an hour. 

Stewed. — Cut the hares into joints, drop into a pot and cover with 
boiling water; then slice in an onion and a bit of bacon, and stew slowly 
one hour or until tender. As old hares are best stewed, it will do no 
harm to put in a young chicken, stewing all together. At the end of 
half an hour add a few potatoes, peeled, and cut in quarters, and, if liked, 
some small bits of light paste, after the potatoes get fairly boiling. When 
all are done, stir in a little cream thickened with white flour, boil up a 
moment and dish for the table. 

Fried. — Disjoint, cut uniform pieces, cover with boiling water, and 
let it simmer until quite tender. Then remove carefully to a dry dish. 
Dredge well with flour, and drop into very hot butter to browa Serve 
with gravy made from the liquor in which it was boiled and cream. Two 
tablespoonfuls of vinegar added while boiling are an improvement. 

Roast Hare. — Make a dressing of fine dry bread crumbs; part graham 
is best. Add to the crumbs a small lump of fresh butter, a little dry 
sage (or other herb, if preferred), and moisten well with tepid water, 
stirring well as you add it. Do not put in too much water; have the 
dressing light and flaky, not wet and heavy. The large and delicious 
liver of the hare, having been thoroughly steamed will add an unwonted 
zest if chopped into bits and put into the stuffing. Fill the hares with 
this, leaving plenty of room for the dressing to swell, sew up, put the 



24 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

hares into a dripping pan, add a cupful of boiling water, and roast as 
slowly as possible during the first half hour. Baste every 15 or 20 min- 
utes, turning as needed, and if any part browns too fast, cover it with a 
clean napkin wet in warm water and folded two or three times. Allow 
from one to two hours for roasting; test with a fork to ascertain when 
the hares are done; take them out of the pan and make the gravy, drain 
the grease all off and set the pan on the stove; then put in any tid-bits 
(as the liver, etc.), and the liquor in which they are boiled; thicken with 
a little browned flour wet with milk or water, and boil up a moment. 

Canning Meat. — Half cook the meat in a kettle, cut meat from the 
bones. If this is done while the meat is hot, wring out a cloth from' 
cold or tepid water, fold in several thicknesses, and set under the glass 
can, letting cloth come up about an inch around sides of can, and it will 
not break, no matter how hot the meat may be. If you spill more broth 
on the cloth be sure to wring out extra water from it, for if the cloth 
is sopping wet, the can will break. Having filled can with meat, pour in 
all the broth the can will hold, and see that it is salted and peppered 
just right for the table. Screw on cover without rubber and, if hot put in 
kettle partly filled with hot water, putting a tin in bottom of kettle to 
set cans on. Three quarts can be put in common-sized kettle. Cover 
with a well-fitting cover that will keep in the steam, and keep boiling for 
two hours. Take out one can at a time, and at once put on a good rubber. 
If you want to keep the meat for several months, if it is chicken, veal or 
beef, have hot melted beef suet and fill the cans even full. If you only 
care to keep the meat for two or three weeks fill up even full with boiling 
broth. This work must be done with dispatch, not letting the contents 
of the can cool in the least. Screw on the cover to the last limit, arid 
if your covers and rubbers are not defective your meat will keep per- 
fectly. In canning pork there is nearly always sufficient grease to broth; 
if not the can may be filled with lard. 

Canning Meat in Tins.— Trim off all surplus tallow from meat, and 
either boil or roast the beef, using but little salt and pepper, preferably 
none at all, as these will attack the tin; meat can be spiced, etc., when 
removed from can to serve. When cooked remove from liquid and trim 
off from bones. If liquid is too greasy let it get cold and then remove 
tallow. While' again heating liquid and meat boiling hot get the cans and 
covers ready, the covers to be pierced by an awl in the center. Use the 
friction top tin can only, for keeping meat through the Summer and dog 
days. You can use glass jars to keep same till May, but they are risky 
during warm weather. When meat and liquid are hot pack meat into the 
cans — any size you wish — not quite full, and pour liquid over same so as 
to cover meat somewhat, then place on the covers good and tight. Put 
cans into oven and bake one to two hours. If cans are too full, liquid

will ooze through vent. The baking will drive out every particle or atom 
of air through vent, and is absolutely necessary for safety. When nearly 
done baking liquefy some paraffin or sealing wax, and heat a soldering 
iron. The paraffin is to seal cover airtight around edge, and the soldering 
iron to use with solder to close up vent opening in center. Take out of 
oven a can at a time and solder vent opening as quickly as possible, then 
paraffin the edge of cover. Place cans — after finishing job — where it is 
dry and cool. A steer can be packed into about 50 or 60 quart cans. 

Chicken Baked in Milk. — Dress and joint a chicken of four to six 
pounds, dust each piece with salt and pepper, and roll in flour. Put the 
chicken in a roasting pan or casserole that it will half fill, then pour over 
it enough sweet milk to cover the chicken completely. Put a close-fitting 
lid on the baker, and put it in the oven, cooking the chicken until tender; 
it will take from two to SJ^ hours. This requires but little attention while 
cooking, the meat is tender and juicy, and the gravy delicious. It is an 
excellent way to cook an elderly fowl; a young bird will, of course, cook 
in a shorter time. As it really gains in flavor by being warmed over, it 
can be cooked on Saturday for the Sunday dinner, thus lessening work. 

Broiled Chicken. — Take broilers of suitable age or size, dress in the 
usual way, split down the back and remove breast bone, which can be 
easily done by running finger along it. Place right side up in dripping 
pan, season with plenty of butter, pepper and salt; put in a hot oven 
for 20 minutes to "draw" or heat well through. Take out; if cooking 
with gas turn, and put under flame a few minutes to brown; then brown 
the top, but do not burn. If cooking on stove with fuel proceed the same 
way on toaster or gridiron. 

Broiled Chicken, O. W. Mapes's Recipe. — The first essential of course 
is to have a nice fat chicken. This should be split through the back and 
laid in a shallow basin. Now place the basin containing the chicken in a 
steamer and steam for an hour and a half. The basin will catch all the 
juices which drip from the meat. These should all be saved and used in 
making the gravy. As soon as it is steamed sufficiently place in a well- 
buttered pan and fry until well browned; remove the meat and add the 
juices from steaming to make a good gravy. This method never has 
failed to bring satisfaction to both cook and guests. Possibly it would 
be equally as good with older birds by allowing more time in the steaming. 

Spring Chicken Fried in Cream. — Put a pint of rich cream in a frying 
pan over a moderate fire till it begins to color, dip the different parts of 
the chicken in flour, fry in the cream on each side till it is a delicate brown.. 
When done put it on a hot platter, pour another half pint of cream into 
the pan, let it boil .one minute, add a saltspoonful of salt, a dash of 
pepper, then pour it over the chicken. Serve garnished with sprigs of 
parsley and a dish of puffed potato slices. 



26 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Jugged Chicken. — Cut the bird up as for a fricassee. To every pound 
allow two heaping t?aspoonfuls of flour, one scant teaspoonful of salt 
and one-quarter teaspoonful of pepper; mix thoroughly and roll each 
piece of chicken in the mixture, then pack closely in a large bean-pot; 
cover with boiling water and bake in a good oven until tender — from two 
to three hours. When placed in the pot sprinkle in a tablespoonful of 
minced onion. When done remove to a hot platter, thicken the liquor 
for gravy and serve in a boat. 

Chicken Loaf.^Mince fine two cupfuls of cold cooked chicken, one 
pound of lean veal and one-fourth pound of fat salt pork. Work in these 
three beaten eggs, a cupful of seasoned and strained tomato sauce, one 
teaspoonful of grated lemon peel, one teaspoonful of salt, one-fourth 
teaspoonful of paprika and enough cracker crumbs to mold with the hands. 
Press firmly into a large wet bowl, invert carefully into a buttered baking 
pan, removing bowl. Add one cupful of water and one tablespoonful of 
butter to the pan. Sift buttered crumbs lightly over the loaf and cover 
the top and sides with carefully peeled and sliced lemons. Bake lyi 
hour in a moderate oven. Browning it nicely before serving. Baste fre- 
quently with the liquor. Serve garnished with lemon slices and parsley. 

Paprika Chicken. — -This is a favorite Hungarian dish. Cut a nice 
tender chicken into pieces as for a fricassee; flatten a little, such pieces 
as need it. Season each piece with salt and pepper, and dredge it lightly 
with flour, while you fry a minced onion in two tablespoonfuls of butter. 
L^y the chicken in the butter and onion, cooking for 20 minutes, so it will 
be evenly and thoroughly done. Take up the chicken and stir in an even 
teaspoonful of salt and a very scant teaspoonful of paprika, or half a 
scant teaspoonful of good mild cayenne pepper of any kind. Add last 
of all a cupful of rich cream. Make some dumplings of a pint of sifted 
flour, two teaspoonfuls of baking powder, a saltspoonful of salt and 
butter the size of half an egg; moisten the dumplings with a cupful of 
milk, and drop them over the sauce. Let them cook well, covered for 
50 minutes, when they will be well puffed up and light. Pour the sauce 
around the chicken and make a circle of the dumplings. If the dumplings 
are steamed over the cream sauce so they do not sink into it they will 
be lighter. 

Panned Fowl with Oysters. — Cut the fowl into pieces suitable for 
serving; lay them in a baking dish, flesh side down; season with a tea- 
spoonful of salt, a fourth of a teaspoonful of pepper and cover with thin 
slices of salt pork. Put one cupful of boiling water in the pan, cover 
closely and bake in a hot oven half an hour (for young chickens). Remove 
the cover and baste every 10 minutes for another half hour, turning the 
pieces so they will brown. Remove to a hot platter, add half a cupful of 
rich milk or cream to the gravy in the pan, first skimming ofif all fat; 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 27 

place on the top of the range and stir in a tablespoonful of flour and same 
of butter blended together; when it boils add a cupful of well-washed 
(and cleaned from shells) oysters; watch carefully and as soon as the 
oysters are plump remove them from the fire; add a teaspoonful of 
finely-chopped parsley and a tablesaoonful of lemon juice. Pour around 
the fowl; garnish with celery tips. .An old fowl will require longer 
cooking. 

Chicken Pie, Southern Style. — Select a fowl weighing four or five 
pounds ; clean carefully, singe and put it on in boiling water enough to 
cover it, and let it simmer gently until it begins to grow tender. Save 
this broth with the giblets. Now cut the chicken in small pieces; slice a 
quarter of a pound of fat pork very thin and fry it with the chicken 
until it is brown. After the chicken and pork are fried take them up 
and stir into the pan in which they were cooked a tablespoonful of flour. 
Stir it over the fire until brown ; then add a pint of the chicken broth, a 
teaspoonful of salt, quarter of a teaspoonful of pepper. Stir this gravy 
until it has boiled two minutes and use it for pie. To make the crust : 
Mix together in a bowl with a knife one pound of flour, one teaspoonful 
of salt, two teaspoonfuls of butter, and just enough cold water to hold 
it together. Roll it out about an inch thick ; cut a quarter of a pound 
of butter in large slices, and lay it all over the paste; fold it up and 
wrap in a floured towel and put in the ice box for half an hour. Roll 
it out, repeating same with another quarter of a pound of butter; roll it 
to a thickness of half an inch, fold it in three thicknesses and roll it out 
again. If the butter breaks through, fold it again in a towel and cool for 
half an hour before using. Line a deep dish; then put in alternate layers 
of chicken, pork and sliced raw potatoes ; pour in as much gravy as the 
dish will hold. Sprinkle with a little chopped parsley, a dash more pepper 
and salt, and cover with a top crust, wetting the edges to make them 
adhere. Cut a hole in the top to allow the steam to escape. 

Chicken Potpie with Stirred Dumplings. — Cut up the fowl for serving, 
wash, put in a deep stewpan, and add three pints of boiling water, salt, 
pepper and a bay leaf. Cook one large onion, and about three slices each 
of turnip and carrot, in a tablespoonful of butter, and cook till soft; 
mash and add to stew; then dip out two tablespoonfuls of the fat from 
the stew, put with the butter, and when boiling stir in three tablespoonfuls 
of flour. Stir over the fire till brown, then stir into the chicken to 
thicken it. A year-old chicken will need two hours' cooking; it should 
only simmer, without hard boiling. For dumplings, into a quart of wheat 
flour sift two heaping teaspoonfuls of baking powder and a half tea- 
spoonful of salt. Sift at least three times. Then stir in rich, sweet milk 
to make a batter, not thick as can be stirred nor yet soft enough to run. 
Drop in spoonfuls over the top of the boiling potpie a half hour before 



28 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

dinner time. Should there be so much gravy that the batter would sink 
beneath its surface remove a bowlful. Cover closely and keep constantly 
boiling. Serve the dinner on a large meat platter, arranging the dumplings 
about its border, heaping the meat and potatoes in the center and serving 
the gravy from a gravy boat. In taking up the dumplings tear them apart 
with two forks instead of using a knife or spoon. 

Smothered Chicken. — Have a year-old chicken split as for broiling. 
Wipe dry, spread it liberally with butter all over, dust with .flour and 
pepper, and place, skin side down, in a dripping pan (over a meat rack). 
Pour in a cupful boiling water, add a few sprigs of parsley, cover closely 
and bake in a hot oven one hour. Then turn the chicken skin side up, 
sprinkle with a half teaspoonful of salt, and brown uncovered, 10 or 15 
minutes. Cut up the giblets, which have been cooked tender in one pint 
of water, add a level dessertspoonful flour and a lump of butter the size 
of an egg with the water from the giblets, which will be reduced to about 
a cupful, and stir all in the dripping pan, seasoning with a saltspoonful 
of salt, a good dash of pepper, parsley or sweet marjoram. Joint the 
chicken that it may be easily carved, but do not separate it. Serve on a 
platter with the gravy poured around. 

Victoria Chicken. — Procure a young chicken of three and one-half 
pounds in weight, singe, draw and wash it, cut the chicken into 10 pieces, 
season with half teaspoonful pepper, and half tablespoonful of salt; rub 
the seasoning and the chicken well together. Cut half pound bacon into 
slices, remove the rind and place the bacon in a pan of boiling water, let 
it lie five minutes, then drain. Put the bacon into a saucepan and fry to 
a delicate brown, then take out the bacon. Put the chicken into the bacon 
fat, add half tablespoonful butter, cover and cook slowly for 30 minutes, 
turning the chicken with a fork three- times during that time, then lay 
the chicken in a round pan with the slices of bacon between, pour over 
three cups of cream, cover the pan and bake one hour in a medium-hot 
oven. When ready to serve lay the chicken on a hot dish, and lay six 
bread croutons in a circle around the dish, strain the sauce over the 
chicken and serve. 

Deviled Mutton. — This is a nice way to warm up cold roast mutton 6r 
lamb. Put one teaspoonful of chopped onion into a stewpan with one 
ounce of butter. Place it over a slow fire, keep the onions stirred until 
rather brown, then add some flour, mix it in well and fry for five min- 
utes; then pour in one-half pint of gravy well seasoned, and let it boil 
until thickened and brown; add one teaspoonful of sugar and one of 
vinegar, one of Worcestershire sauce, a few chopped gherkins and a few 
button mushrooms if at hand; put in the mutton, which has been pre- 
viously sliced in thin slices and perfectly free from fat; let it remain a 
few minutes and simmer, not boil. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 39 

Flank Steak, Rolled. — Spread a steak weighing about 2^ pounds with 
a dressing composed of IJ^ cupful bread cfumbs — dip the crusts previously 
in boiling water that they may easily crumble — one medium-sized onion, 
two tablespoonfuls canned tomato, one beaten egg, one tablespoonful 
butter, one teaspoonful salt, one-quarter teaspoonful pepper. Stir egg 
with bread, add the onion sliced, tomato, butter and seasoning. After 
spreading roll snugly and tie with pieces of string. Lay three slices of 
salt pork on top, place in dripping pan with one-half cupful water. Roast 
slowly one hour. May be eaten hot with gravy, or cold. 

Goulash. — Cut two leeks or onions, small-sized ones, into fine pieces, 
and fry them in hot butter till they are brown. Add one cupful of beef 
broth, a little salt, half a teaspoonful of paprika or red pepper, and 
half a teaspoonful of browned flour. Stir until smooth, then strain. 
Have ready one-half pound of raw steak, cut into quarter-inch squares. 
The better the steak, necessarily, the better the result will be, and there- 
fore porterhouse is preferred. Toss the meat into a frying pan just long 
enough to cook the outside, then add the sauce. Add two warm boiled 
potatoes, cut into good-sized pieces, and let the pan remain on the back 
of the stove 15 minutes before serving. 

Goose, Braised. — Braised goose is superior to a roast, in the taste of 
many, the bird acquiring flavor from the vegetables with it. The &ven 
is the place for the cooking, and a porcelain-lined iron pot or earthen 
cooking crock (either having a tight-fitting cover) gives the best results. 
Prepare the goose as for roasting, but do not stuff. In the baking dish 
put a layer of chopped or sliced onions, celery, turnips, carrots and two 
apples. Sprinkle with a teaspoonful of salt, one of powdered sage and 
six shakes of pepper. Lay the goose upon them, pour over it two cupfuls 
of boiling water, dredge with salt, pepper, powdered sage and flour. Cover 
closely and cook slowly for at least four hours (allow 25 minutes to the 
pound). Turn the goose every two hours. Add more water if necessary. 
Less time is required if a roaster is used. When tender, remove the 
goose. Rub the vegetables and gravy through a colander, return to the 
fire and stir in a table.spoonful of browned flour. Boil up once and serve 
in a boat. Garnish the goose with parsley. 

Gumbo. — This takes four hours to make. Put into a kettle two pounds 
ol lean soup beef, one-half a chicken that has been jointed, a small ham 
bone, or a good-sized slice of lean bacon, a slice of green pepper and a 
square inch of onion. Add three quarts of water and boil or simmer 
gently, skimming often for two hours. At the end of this time add three 
pints of okra that has first been cut in slices and fried lightly in a very 
small amount of butter, also a large potato cut in pieces, which gradually 
breaks and thickens the soup. An hour later, after frequent skimmings, 
add a full quart of tomatoes and the corn cut from two large ears, also

the cobs, and boil gently for another hour. Then "remove the corncobs 
and what is left of the beef, and the chicken bones, leaving the chicken 
meat in the stew; season with salt, cayenne pepper, a teaspoonful of 
Worcestershire sauce and a teaspoonful of sugar, and it is ready to serve. 
Dry boiled rice is nice served with this gumbo, which is a stew rather 
than a soup. Many recipes for gumbo call for a small quantity of "fillet 
powder" ; this is the tender young green leaves of sassafras powdered. 

Ham, Curing. — This is a Virginia method. For curing four hams, 
averaging 12 pounds each, have ready one and a half gallons of the best 
salt, one pound of good brown sugar, one-eighth pound of powdered 
saltpeter, one ounce of black pepper and one-half ounce of cayenne. Cut 
the joints into proper shapes, without unnecessary bone and fat, and lay 
them on a board on table. First rub the skin well with salt and lay 
each joint aside, then begin over again, and into the fleshy side of each 
ham rub two teaspoonfuls of saltpeter and a tablespoonful of brown 
sugar mixed together. Rub the pepper, particularly, about the hock and 
under the bone and give to the whole ham a good application of salt. 
Now pack the hams, one upon another, the skin side downward, with a 
layer of salt between, into a tub or box, the bottom of which has also 
been covered with salt. The process of salting will be complete in five 
weeks. At the end of that time have ready about a peck of hickory 
ashes; clean the hams with a brush or dry cloth and rub them with the 
ashes. To smoke the hams the joints should be hung from joists beneath 
the ceiling and a slow, smothered fire kept up for five or six weeks, so 
as to smoke thoroughly, but not overheat the hams. Or, as an excellent 
substitute for this process, paint the hams with a coating of ^yroligneous 
acid, let them dry and repeat the operation. Wrap each ham in paper 
and encase it in a canvas or strong cotton bag. 

A simple way to salt bacon and hams in brine is to rub the meat well 
with salt, especially into the exposed ends of bones, and then pack into 
a barrel, with a layer of salt between each piece. Allow the meat to 
remain thus for 48 hours, then pour over all a brine strong enough to 
bear up an egg. Let the meat remain in pickle six weeks ; then smoke. 

Molasses pickle is made as follows : To four quarts of fine salt and 
two ounces of pulverized saltpeter add enough molasses to make a paste. 
Hang the hams in a cool dry place for three or four days after cuttitfg 
up ; then cover with the pickle mixture, thickest on the flesh side, and lay 
them skin down for three or four days. For 100 pounds of ham make 
brine in the following proportion: Seven pounds coarse salt; two ounces 
saltpeter; one-half ounce pearlash; four gallons soft water. Heat grad- 
ually, removing all scum as it arises, then cool. Pack the hams in a 
barrel, pour the brine over them, and keep in pickle five to eight weeks 
according to size. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 31 

Ham, Sugar Cured. — To 50 pounds of ham or "side bacon" allow three 
pounds of sugar and a pint of molasses, six pounds of salt, one fuU 
tablespoonful of saleratus and the same of saltpeter. Cover the bottom 
of your firkin with salt (about two pounds). Mix sugar, molasses, salt- 
peter, saleratus and the remaining salt into a paste. Rub each piece 
thoroughly with this, work it in well and hard, and pack into the firkin, 
the rind downward. Cover all with cold water — just enough to rise above 
the meat. Lay a heavy board on top, weight it with a stone to keep the 
meat under water, and leave it thus for four weeks, turning the meat and 
stirring up the pickle every week. Take out, then wipe, rub into the 
pieces as much dry salt and an equal quantity of sugar as they will take 
up; pack in a dry firkin and leave for 24 hours before sending to the 
smokehouse. 

Hamburg Steak, Baked. — One and one-half pound raw chopped beef, 
two cupfuls of stale bread softened with half a cupful of hot milk and 
cooled, two eggs, small onion minced, teaspoonful of salt, saltspoonful 
of pepper and pinch of ginger. Mix well and shape into a square; place 
in baking pan with a tablespoonful of tomato, small onion and butter 
the size of a walnut on top of meat. Bake one hour, basting frequently. 
The potatoes should be boiled 15 minutes, then drained, pared and placed 
in pan with the Hamburg steak to cook 45 minutes, being turned and 
basted often. Medium-sized potatoes are best for this. Serve arranged 
around the meat. 

Hungarian Hamburg Steak.^Beat an egg into a bowl, stir in bread 
crumbs (about a cupful), a small onion, grated, salt and paprika (a mild- 
flavored cayenne pepper). The meat is Stirred into this, and after thor- 
ough mixing is formed into a ball. An onion is fried brown in butter, 
put into an earthen saucepan with a tight-fitting cover, and the meat ball 
is added, with two tomatoes cut into quarters around it. After simmering 
for half an hour the meat is turned gently, so as not to break the ball, 
then allowed to cook quietly for nearly an hour, and served with the 
vegetables as a garnish. 

Senator Hanna's Hash. — This is the recipe given by the Boston Cook- 
ing School. Take equal portions of tender boiled corned beef and mealy 
boiled potatoes. Cut the potatoes into small cubes and the meat as fine 
as possible. Mix thoroughly with these a small onion, chopped very fine; 
a slice of onion is often sufficient. Butter a hot frying pan and turn into 
it chopped materials. Press into the center of the mass a clove of garlic, 
wrapped in a piece of salt pork or mild cured bacon. Set over a moderate 
fire, cover and let cook, adding a small quantity of water, if moist hash 
is preferred; when heated, stir, remove the garlic and give the whole 
round shape. Let stand in the oven until browned underneath, then 
carefully slide on a serving dish. While the hash is cooking cut one or 



33 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

two Bermuda onions into thin slices and fry until crisp in deep fat. Use 
these as a garnish for the hash (or omit if preferred). Serve with lemon 
quarters. 

Hot-Pot. — Two pounds of cross-rib is cut in small pieces and put in 
an earthen saucepan, with two minced onions, five or six small green pep- 
pers, whole, a few chives, a handful of seeded raisins, a cupful of to- 
matoes, peeled and sliced, eight or 10 olives, a bit of thyme, a big table- 
spoonful of drippings, salt to taste, and a cupful of vinegar and water. 
The pot is covered tightly, and the mixture simmered slowly until the 
meat is cooked to pieces; then a tablespoonful of butter well coated with 
flour is stirred in to thicken the gravy. 

Liver and Bacon in Casserole. — Slice liver about half an- inch thick, 
and put in a buttered saucepan, peppering lightly. Over the liver lay a 
dozen thin slices of bacon, and strew these with chopped onion and par- 
sley. Cover closely and cook slowly for about two hours. The cooking 
must not be hurried. When ready to serve the liver, let the gravy, with 
the bacon in it, boil hard for two minutes, then pour it over the the 
liver in the serving dish. 

Liver, Fried in New Orleans Style. — Cut a pound of calf's liver in half- 
inch cubes. After washing and draining, place in a bowl which has been 
rubbed with an onion. Between two layers of liver place a layer of 
chopped onion and parsley, sprinkling with salt and dusting lightly with 
cayenne. After lialf an hour take out the liver and shake off all the 
onion. Roll lightly in flour and drop into a deep kettle of boiling fat. 
Drain on paper and serve very hot with lemon. The liver cooks to de- 
licious tenderness and delicacy of flavor. 

Calves' Liver, English Style. — Two pounds of fresh liver, one-half 
pound fat salt pork, one spoonful of butter, half an onion, one spoonful 
chopped parsley and pepper. Put the butter in a warm, not hot, sauce- 
pan, cut the liver into slices half an inch thick and lay upon the butter; 
mince the pork and cover the liver; sprinkle the parsley and onion with 
pepper on top; cover the saucepan closely and set it into a kettle of hot 
water; keep this water below the boiling point for an hour, then let it 
boil another hour; the liver will by this time be very tender and juicy 
if the heat has been properly adjusted. Take it out and place it in a 
dish to keep warm. Thicken the gravy with brown butter and pour over 
the liver and serve. 

English Meat Pie.— Chop cold beef finely, put in a deep baking dish 
a layer of the meat, strew lightly with bread crumbs, season highly with 
sslt, pepper, butter and a few drops of onion juice; repeat the process 
till the dish is full or your meat used up. Pour over it a cup of stock 
or gravy, or, lacking these, hot water with a teaspoonful of butter melted 
in it; on top a good layer of Bread crumbs should be put and seasoned 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 33 

and dotted with butter. Cover and bake half an hour; remove the cover 
and brown. 

Mock Duck. — Four pork tenderloins; slash lengthwise, rub with salt 
and pepper, fill with dressing made of bread crumbs, one onion, one egg, 
one-half cupful butter, salt and pepper to taste; tie together and bake in 
roaster. Serve with hot apple sauce made as follows : Pare and quarter 
(if large, cut in eighths) as many apples as the family appetite requires. 
Put a layer of apples in a granite or enameled shallow pan, put bits of 
butter, goodly supply sugar and dash of cinnamon on the apples. Do this 
in layers till pan is full; add a little water and bake till rich and clear, 
not just barely done. 

Mutton Mince With Eggs. — Scrape every morsel of meat from the 
bone, crack the latter, cover with cold water and let it simmer at the 
hack of the stove for four or five hours. Strain oflf the cupful of liquid 
and thicken with a lump of butter rolled in browned flour; season with ■ 
salt, pepper and tomato catsup; stir into it the cold mutton cut small 
and a handful of bread crumbs, strewing some of these on top; bake 
until the surface bubbles, drop four or five eggs upon the top, pepper 
and salt them, set back in the oven and leave there until the eggs are 
"set." 

Mutton Pie. — A mutton pie made from the neck of mutton is as 
savory as it is economical. Cut off the spine bone and the scrag end, 
shorten the ribs to about three inches, but save all these trimmings to 
make the gravy for the pie. Cut the mutton into neat chops, pare off 
the fat, season with salt and pepper and place in the deep pie dish in a 
circle, one lapping over the other. Fill the center with tiny potato balls 
cut out with the cutter; add the mutton gravy which has been boiled to 
make the quantity required, sprinkle with salt and pepper, cover with good 
pie crust brushed over with the yolk of an egg and bake for an hour 
and a half in a moderate oven. 

Ragout of Mutton. — Use two pounds of mutton from the shoulder or 
breast. Cut in small pieces, about two inches square. Cut up some of 
the mutton fat which has not touched the skin and fry slowly in a pan 
until there is about a gill of liquid fat; take out the solid pieces and put 
in the mutton and stir until it becomes brown. Take the meat from the 
fat, being careful to press out all the fat. To the fat add one pint of 
turnip cubes and two tablespoonfuls of onion cut fine ; cook slowly for 
10 minutes, then take them out and put in the stew pan with the meat. 
Pour the fat from the frying pan and put in two tablespoonfuls of butter 
and the same amount of flour ; stir until brown, when add one quart of 
boiling water. When this thickens add it to the meat and vegetables with 
a rounding teaspoonful of salt and one-third of a teaspoonful of pepper. 
Simmer for three hours^ covered. 



34 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

"Pawnhas." — This old-fashioned dish is similar to scrapple. Boil to- 
gether the "jowls," liver and heart of a hog until very tender. Take out 
all bones, chop the heart and meat from jowls until very fine;; crumble 
the liver as finely as possible and put all back into the kettle. Now 
season with pepper and salt, and be sure to add enough water "to keep 
it from being too rich or greasy. Stir in white cornmeal until you have 
a thin mush, let cook slowly half an hour, pour into a large crock or 
jar; set away to cool. When cold, slice like mush and put into a skillet 
to fry. Add no grease. This is delicious and will keep indefinitely in 
a cool place. 

Pigeons, Potted. — Place six cleaned birds in a deep kettle with one 
pint of vinegar and three onions, halved; let stand over night, then throw 
the vinegar and onions away. Brown six slices of pork and two onions, 
sliced; place in the kettle with the pigeons; add one pint of hot water, 
salt and pepper ; cover and simmer about two hours ; serve the pigeons 
on a hot dish about a mound of parsley; strain the liquor, thicken, and 
pass in a gravy boat. 

Pigs' Feet in Jelly. — Thoroughly scrape and clean one dozen pigs' feet. 
Place them in a kettle, cover with boiling water, add one tablespoonful 
of salt and simmer steadily until tender. Transfer the feet to a stone 
crock, placing between them thin slices of onion. Heat and boil to- 
gether for five minutes two quarts of good vinegar, one bay leaf, two 
tablespoonfuls of sugar, one dozen whole cloves, six tiny red peppers, and 
one-half teaspoonful oi salt. Add one quart of boiling water and pour 
at once over the pigs' feet. Cover and let stand two days before using. 

Pilgrim Pie. — Cut a two-pound piece of fresh pork into dice, after it 
is cooked, and prepare the following crust: One pint mashed potatoes, 
o>,«-half teaspoonful salt, one tablespoonful butter, one-fourth teaspoon- 
ful pepper, one-fourth cup of milk, one level teaspoonful baking powder, 
and enough flour to make a crust which can be easily rolled out one 
inch thick. Put alternate layers, in a baking dish, of the diced pork, 
raw oysters, minced parsley, a light dusting of Summer savory, finely 
shredded onion, with salt and pepper to suit, and one tablespoonful but- 
ter; cover with a brown sauce; fit a cover of the potato biscuit and bake 
in hot oven 20 minutes. Five minutes before it is finished draw out, cover 
with fine cracker crumbs mixed with one egg; return to the oven to 
finish browning; garnish with parsley. This potato crust is excellent for 
any meat pie. 

Pork With Corn Dumplings.— Cook a piece of shoulder of pork in a 
big pot until tender; then mix the desired quantity of cornmeal to a 
thick dough as in making bread (the addition of an egg to the dough im- 
proves the dumplings). Drop balls of the dough about the size of a 
walnut in the boiling watef about the meat in the pot and cook 20 min- 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 35 

utes, when the dumplings will be done, and will have a thick gravy 
around them. Take care not to let the mixture burn. The fat and 
juices of the meat season the dumplings excellently. 

Rabbit, Jugged. — Select a plump tender rabbit. Wash, wipe dry, and 
cut into well-shaped pieces. Have ready a teaspoonful of salt and one- 
fourth teaspoonful of pepper and rub this into the rabbit pieces. Put 
four tablespoonfuls of flour on a plate and roll each piece in this. Heat 
half a cupful of butter in frying pan ; when hot fry the rabbit, browning 
on both sides, being careful not to burn the butter. As soon as it 
browns put the rabbit into a stewpan and into the hot butter stir what is 
left of the flour in which the rabbit was rolled; add three teacupfuls hot 
water and cook 10 minutes. Pour this over the rabbit, adding two 
cloves, one-half bayleaf, tw'o or three allspice, one teaspoonful salt, one- 
fourth teaspoonful pepper, a slice or two of onion. Cover closely and 
simmer for an hour and a half. Add one teaspoonful lemon juice and 
one tablespoonful good catsup. Remove the rabbit to a hot platter; 
strain what liquid is left, add to it a teaspoonful each of butter and flour 
rubbed smooth and a cupful of hot water; boil up once, pour over the 
rabbit and serve. 

Rabbit, Breaded. — Dress the rabbit, then let it soak over night in cold 
salt water. Cut into neat pieces, and boil gently until tender in , clear 
water to which an onion has been added. Let it cool and drain; then 
dip in well-beaten egg, roll in cracker crumbs and fry in hot butter. 
Serve with cranberry sauce. Barbecued rabbit, a favorite southern dish, 
may also be recommended: Lay the rabbit in salt and water 30 minutes, 
then scald with boiling water and wipe dry, rub well with butter, and 
sprinkle with pepper and salt. Broil until quite brown, and lay on a 
hot dish ; butter plentifully on both sides. Prepare a sauce of four tea- 
spoonfuls of vinegar, one teaspoonful of made mustard, one of currant 
jelly and one of walnut catsup. Pour this hot over the rabbit. 

Ragout with Dumplings. — Get a piece of nice, fresh round steak, 
about one and one-half pound (cut thick). Cut it into pieces about an 
inch square, smother it with flour, well seasoned with salt and red pep- 
per. Brown in the frying pan one large onion or two small ones, with 
about one large tablespoonful of butter; then add the steak and brown. 
Put the whole into a granite saucepan, pour over it five pints of boiling 
water and simmer two hours. About 20 minutes before serving make 
dumplings as follows: A cup of flour sifted with a little salt and a half 
teaspoonful of baking powder, and rub in a teaspoonful of butter. Mix 
very soft with milk — so soft that it is slightly sticky; drop by small 
spoonfuls into the stew and cover lightly until served. 

Sausage. — ^This is a Virginia recipe. To every 10 pounds of meat 
use three ounces of salt, one of black pepper, one-half ounce of sage 



36 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

rubbed fine. Having all ingredients weighed, put a layer of the meat 
cut in strips, sprinkle the mixed seasoning over it, another layer of meat 
with more seasoning, distributing as evenly as possible. Run twice 
throungh the grinder, and when it is put on the table it is surprising 
to see how quickly it' vanishes. Ordinary pork sausage, smoked in bags, 
makes a desirable change, and keeps well. Pack the sausage meat in 
small bags of coarse, strong muslin, the size selected being that most 
convenient for slicing; small salt sacks, well washed, may answer. Close 
the bags, and then smoke, just like ham, the amount of smoking depend- 
mg on the family taste. When used, split down the seam of the bag 
for convenience in cutting the slices, and fry like ham. 

Sausage, Bologna..— Six pounds of lean beef; one pound salt pork; 
three pounds lean fresh pork ; one pound beef suet ; one ounce white pep- 
per; one teaspoonful ground mace; three ounces salt; one teaspoonful 
cayenne; one large onion chopped fine. Chop the meat and suet sep- 
arately very fine, then mix; add all the seasoning, and mix thoroughly. 
Fill into casings and tie into lengths, or use' strong linen bags. Make a 
brine that will bear an egg; put the sausage into it, and let stand two 
weeks, turning and skimming every day. At the end of the first week 
throw away the old brine, and put the sausage into new for the second 
week; then smoke for a week. When smoked rub over the outside with 
olive oil, and store in a cool, dark dry place. If you wish to keep the 
sausage for any length of time sprinkle the outside with pepper. 

Sausage, Frankfurter. — Chop up pork, lean meat and fat (ham can 
be used) in the proportion of four pounds lean to one of fat. To a 
pound of the mixture season with salt, 11 grams, one-half gram salt- 
petre, two grams white pepper and one-half gram cloves. Mix the whole 
so intimately that "you cannot tell the fat pieces from the lean.'' The 
more thorough the mixing the better the result. If the mixing is not 
free, you can add a little water, but do not overdo this. If too "waxy" 
from excess of fat, add lean; or, the other way, if too meaty. Use pig's 
cases for the filling. Tie the sausage in length desired. Hang the links 
well apart in the smokehouse. Tolerable heat will do them rightly 
enough, but if you want the deep rich tint of brown, you will have to 
finish them off over a brick fire. It is hard to fix the temperature, 
as the smokehouse in the open will be cooler than the one indoors. Test 
the state by running a quill in and examining the extract by the taste, 
sight and smell. Sometimes they are put in bundles of 10 or 13 folded 
together and pressed to flatten. Keep in a box under weight before put- 
ting in the smoke. 

Sausage, Holland Home.— Grind, mix and season the meat as de- 
sired. Instead of stuffing "cases," pack in half-gallon stone jars (but- 
ter jars). Bake four hours in a moderately hot oven. Remove from 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 37 

the oven and press with a heavy weight 12 hours — over night usually. 
Then remove the weight. There will be some fat, but not enough to 
cover it. Heat lard to the boiling point and pour over enough to cover. 
This seals — excludes the air. Keep in a cool place. Beef or pork may be 
kept in this way indefinitely. 

Oxford Sausage. — One pound each of finely chopped veal, pork and 
beef suet. Mix through this one quart of bread crumbs, grated peel of 
half a lemon, a grated nutmeg, a sprig each of savory, thyme and sweet 
marjoram and a tablespoonful of powdered sage leaves. Make in cakes 
and fry in very little hot butter. 

Sausage,- Pork and Beef. — For 10 pounds of sausage use seven and 
one-half pounds of pork and two and a half of beef; grind fine, add two 
tablespoonfuls of salt, one teaspoonful each of pepper, allspice, cloves and 
sage. Heat all together until so hot you cannot hold your finger in it. 
Turn into stone jars that have been thoroughly scalded and aired, cover 
with cheesecloth and pour hot suet over the cloth. When any is wanted 
for use, take out and make into cakes and fry. 

Summer Sausage. — Use any recipe you like best, but use cloth casings 
made from muslin, casings to have a diameter of three to four inches, 
and length to fit a baking pan. Casings are easily made witli st■^ving 
machine. Smoke the finished sausage to your heart's content. After 
smoking let sausage dry sufficiently, which takes four or five weeks, de- 
pending on where hung to dry. The sausage should be fit for eating, 
which can readily be ascertained by cutting one through. When dry 
enough melt a quantity of paraffin— about one-half pound for a dozen 
sausages— put in baking pan, then place the sausages therein and roll 
about in the hot paraffin, one at a time. Hang up in a dry place and 
they will keep nicely and indefinitely. 

Virginia Beef Sausage. — Mix two cupfuls of finely-chopped raw beef, 
V/2 cupful of fat salt pork minced very fine, two teaspoonfuls of pow- 
dered sage, a Scant teaspoonful of pepper — the pork should furnish suffi- 
cient salt — and one tablespoonful of lemon juice. When thoroughly 
mixed pack it in small round tin cans and set away to become hard. 
When wanted for breakfast slice three-fourths of an inch thick and 
either brown in the oven or fry in a hot, well-greased pan. 

Scrapple, Philadelphia. — Take a cleaned pig's head and boil until the 
flesh strips easily from the bones. Remove all the bones and chop fine. 
Set the liquor in which the meat was boiled aside until cold, take the 
cake of fat from the surface and return the liquor to the fire. When it 
boils, put in the chopped meat and season well with pepper and salt. Let 
it boil again and thicken with cornmeal as you would in making ordinary 
cornmeal mush, by letting it slip slowly through the fingers to prevent 
lumps. Cook an hour, stirring constantly at first, afterward putting back 



38 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

on the range in a position to boil gently. When done, pour into a long, 
square pan, not too deep, and mold. In cold weather this can be kept 
several weeks. Slice and fry brown in butter or dripping. 

Souse. — ^Clean pig's ears and feet well; cover them with cold water 
slightly salted and boil until tender. Pack in stone jars while hot, and 
cover while you make ready for pickle. To half a gallon of good cider 
vinegar allow half a cup of white sugar, three dozen whole black pep- 
pers, a dozen blades of mace and a dozen cloves. Boil this one minute, 
taking care that it really boils, and pour while hot over the still warm 
feet and ears. It will be ready to use in two days and will keep in a cool 
place for two months. If you wish it for breakfast, make a batter of 
one egg, one cup of milk, salt to taste, and a teaspoonful of butter, with 
enough flour for a thin muffin batter; dip each piece in this and fry in 
hot lard or dripping. Or dip each in beaten egg, then in pounded 
cracker before frying. Souse is also good eaten cold, especially the feet. 

Stew, Oven. — Two or three pounds of beef shin are selected, the bone 
being broken into three or four pieces. After wiping with a damp cloth, 
remove all the meat from the bone and cut into small pieces for serving. 
Scrape the marrow from the bone and place in a kettle, and in it brown 
first the meat, then the vegetables cut in cubes — half an onion and one 
carrot. Now dredge well with flour and salt, adding about a tablespoon- 
ful of browned flour to give color. Add one or two whole cloves, one- 
half cup of tomato or a little tomato catsup, then the pieces of bone. 
Cook in the oven in a deep iron meat-pan for three or four hours, adding 
potatoes, cut in cubes, one hour before serving. 

Stew, Tomato. — Fry a tiny onion, or a slice or two of ordinary size, 
in a couple of tablespoonfuls of fat. Add two or three slices of carrot 
and let them brown. Then stir in a cupful of canned tomatoes and half a 
cupful of beef stock or gravy. If stock is used the mixture should be 
thickened with a little flour. Add also half a bayleaf and a couple of 
sprays of Summer savory, and simmer the stew slowly for half an hour, 
so that it may be permeated with the seasonings. At the end of this time 
add the cold meat from a shank of beef, or any "leftover," cut in small 
pieces. Simmer very slowly for five or 10 minutes and serve hot, after 
dashing in a little salt and pepper. 

Tough Meat. — To soften a tough steak pour a few spoonfuls of vine- 
gar, or vinegar and oil mixed, over it, and allow it to stand 12 to 24 
hours, turning occasionally. A tough piece of meat may be laid in vine- 
gar (not too strong) for three or four days in Summer, or twice as long in 
Winter. Oil or spices may be added to the vinegar if desired, this bath 
being termed a marinade. Tough meat should receive long gentle cook- 
ing, preferably in an enclosed vessel which will prevent evaporation of 
juices. Such beef should not be treated like a tender rib roast; it would 



TH2 RURAL COOK SOOK. 3& 

better be braised (pot roast) or cooked as beef a la mode. The mar- 
inade will be found desirable when the meat is cooked in this way. If 
stewed, the same system of prolonged gentle cooking (preferably in an 
earthen stewpan or casserole) should be employed. 

Stuffed Tenderloin. — Procure a good-sized tenderloin, slit one side 
open and lay within a dressing made as follows : One cupful of dry grated 
crumbs, one tablespoonful of minced parseley, one large teaspoonful of 
mixed sweet herbs, thyme, Summer savory, sweet marjoram and sage, 
one heaping teaspoonful of finely chopped onion fried in one tablespoon- 
ful of butter, one-half teaspoonful salt, one saltspoonful pepper. If this 
amount of butter does not make it moist enough add a trifle more melted 
butter, but no water. Stuff the tenderloin and sew up the opening. If 
it is not fat place two or three slices of bacon over the top, fastening 
with wooden toothpicks. Rub into the meat one teaspoonful of salt, one- 
fourth teaspoonful of white pepper. Dust with flour and roast. When 
done remove the tenderloin to a heated platter and put the roasting pan 
on top of stove, adding one tablespoonful of flour to the gravy which it 
contains. When thoroughly browned add a cupful of hot water, two 
tablespoonfuls of chopped gherkins, and one tablespoonful of finely- 
chopped olives. 

Veal and Ham Pie. — A pound of veal cutlet cut in small pieces is 
rolled in flour and browned in hot bacon fat. Cover with boiling water, 
or, if possible, with stock made from the trimmings of veal and seasoned 
with sweet herbs, carrot and onion, and simmer for about two hours 
Put the pieces of veal in a baking dish. Have ready half a cupful of 
finely chopped cooked ham. Add to it a little of the liquid in which the 
veal was cooked, and pound smooth in a mortar. Then press through a 
puree sieve, and add the rest of the liquid with such seasoning as may 
be desired. Pour this over the meat in the dish, adding half a pint of 
oysters and a few bits of butter. Cover the dish with a pastry or rich 
biscuit crust, and bake about 25 minutes. 

Veal, Paprika Schnitzel. — Cut two pounds of thick veal steak into 
small pieces, roll in seasoned flour, fry brown in salt pork fat. Remove 
the meat from the pan, add two tablespoonfuls of flour to the remaining 
fat, brown lightly and pour in the strained liquid from a pint can of to- 
matoes, or if desired slice in a pint of fresh peeled tomatoes. Add a 
slice each of onion and carrot, three bay leaves and a bit of mace, then 
return the meat to the sauce, cover closely and simmer for three-quarters 
of an hour. When done remove the meat, add a little more salt if neces- 
sary (the pork helps to season) a pinch of paprika or red pepper, and 
strain on to the" platter. 



CHAPTER IV. 

PASTRY AND PIES. 

When pieplant gives tlie first good mess, 

With nice hot biscuit, I confess 
Our follis feel good. Pop says : "I guess 

Ton ought to have a hran' new dress." 
"And you a coat," I sez, "no less !" 

I know our folks will always bless 
The day that pieplant gives first mess. 

Some of our friends, who have spent many years abroad, tell of a 
Roman pension or boarding-house whose proprietor boasted that he had 
recipes for more than 365 delicious desserts. During the months our 
friends were at the pension they never had the same dessert twice, which, 
they complained, was really pathetic, for many of the dishes were so 
delicious that they longed for a repetition. We doubt whether anyone 
could duplicate that experience in an American boarding-house, where, 
too often, pie is almost the only form of dessert, except a restricted range 
of puddings. The unwholesome effect of pastry often results, we believe, 
from eating it as the finish to a hearty meal, when the digestion is already 
fully tasked. We are told by those who use it that the oil pie crust, 
recipe for which is given, is more easily digested than that made with 
other shortening. 

Pie Crust. — For one pie use one cupful sifted flour, one-half cup of 
shortening, pinch of salt. It will be much flakier if chopped together 
with a knife, instead of rubbing in the hands. Stir in enough cold water 
to mix it so it may be rolled out. Handle as little as possible, and keep 
very cold. It is improved by making a day before using, and storing in 
the icebox or other cold place. 

Cream Pie Crust. — If one can use cream, delicious crust may be made. 
Add baking powder and salt to the flour and mix stiff with cream that is 
not too heavy. The crust is tender, browns quickly and has a very sweet, 
agreeable flavor. 

Oil Pie Crust. — For this either olive or refined cotton-seed oil may 
be used. For one pie take one cup flour, add pinch of salt, mix and add 
two tablespoonfuls oil; rub well together and add three tablespoonfuls 
cold water. Handle dough as little as possible and roll thin. 

Puff Paste. — Use equal weights of flour and butter; by measure, one 
pint of flour and one cup of butter. Wash the butter in cold water 
until all the salt is out; the hands should first be washed in hot, then 
cold water, to prevent the butter from sticking. When washed until 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 43 

smooth and waxy divide butter into four parts, pat until thin, wrap in 
a napkin and place upon ice. Mix a little salt with the flour, mix in 
about one-half cup of ice water, stirring it in with a knife, and cut 
until it can be taken up clean from the bowl. Put on a well-floured 
board, roll until one-half inch thick. Roll one portion of the butter thin, 
fold it up inside the paste, pat and roll out again. Repeat this process 
with the rest of the butter. When putting in the butter, fold the sides 
of the paste over it toward the middle, then the ends over, and double; 
then roll. This process should continue until no streaks of fat are shown. 
Whenever the butter becomes soft, it should be chilled, and when finished 
the paste should be wrapped in " a napkin, and kept in the refrigerator. 
This is the paste used for patty cases, and similar delicate pastry. It 
requires a "knack'' as well as a recipe to get good results. 

Crust for Raised Pies. — This is the crust used by English house- 
keepers for pork and other meat pies, in which the crust is patted and 
shaped into a deep dish shape, which is filled with meat and then covered 
with a top crust. The crust is hard and stiff when cold, but softens 
when warm. Put one cupful of water in a saucepan, add one pound of 
lard, put on stove to melt, and allow it to come to boiling point, stirring 
well ; sift about three pounds of flour into a bowl, make a hole in the . 
middle, and stir in the hot liquid, mixing with a spoon until it is cool 
enough to knead with the hands. It may require the addition of more 
flour, as it should be very stiff. To make a pork pie, this crust should 
be molded with the hands into a dish shape four or five inches deep; 
an oval four or five by six inches is a convenient size. Good, tender, 
fresh roasting pork is cut into half-inch pieces, and well seasoned; the 
pie is filled and covered, after a small amount of water is sprinkled over, 
and then the pie is baked for about ly^ hour, in a steady oven. It is 
always served cold. Game birds or pigeons make excellent raised pie 
also. To give a shining yellow appearance to the pastry, brush it over 
with the yolk of an egg, beaten up with two tablespoonfuls of milk, 
about 10 minutes before it is taken out of the oven. 

Almond Bars. — Roll puff paste into thin narrow strips. Beat one 
egg white slightly and mix it with two tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar 
and one cupful of finely-chopped almonds. Spread this mixture over the 
strips of paste and brown them in the oven. Sometimes the almonds are 
rolled into the paste. Mix two tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar with 
the same amount of chopped almonds and sprinkle over the paste when 
first rolled out. Fold and roll again, then repeat the process. Finally cut 
into long sticks, brush with white of an egg and brown in the oven. One 
teaspoonful of cinnamon may be used in place of the almonds, when tl^« 
result will be cinnamon bars. 



42 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Apple Pie. — This is how a Michigan housekeeper makes it : The under 
crust was first brushed over lightly with white of an egg and allowed to 
stand while the rest of the work went on; this to keep the juices from 
soaking into the crust before baking. Next a half cupful of sugar was 
put in; along with a half to a tablespoonful of flour, according to the 
degree of juiciness of the apples, and a generous pinch of cinnamon or 
allspice according to choice. These were rubbed smoothly together to 
insure a jelly-like consistency of the finished pie, without the unpalatable 
doughy lumps. The fruit is then added, the remainder of the sugar 
poured over (a cupful in all for very sour apples), the top dotted thickly 
with butter, and unless the apples are. very juicy a dessertspoonful of 
water added. The edge of the under crust is now moistened with water, 
the top applied and the two pinched neatly together; the whole brushed 
over with rich milk to insure an even golden-brownness, and a tiny funnel 
made of writing paper twisted and pinned into shape inserted in the air 
hole cut in the top. These details observed you may now put your pie 
into the oven with a certainty that it will come out a thing of beauty, 
with none of its savory juices burning to a crisp in the bottom of 
the oven. For very young apples, however, she always used instead of 
the water, a generous tablespoonful of spiced vinegar (left over from 
any spiced Sweet pickle) with a little more flour. Or if apples had been 
kept some time and were shriveled and insipid, she found the same treat- 
ment a vast improvement. Lacking the spiced vinegar she sometimes used 
lemon juice with an additional sprinkling of sugar and spices. Other fruit 
pies were made in a similar manner, always taking into consideration the 
qualities of the fruit as to acidity and juiciness. For canned fruits 
already sweetened, such as huckleberries, elderberries and the like, which 
were very juicy and required no extra sweetening, she usually rubbed the 
flour (in same proportion of a spoonful to a pie) in a bit of the juice, 
and added it with whatever spices were necessary to the rest of the fruit, 
and set it over the fire until the flour was cooked, adding a little butter. 
When cold the mixture was filled into the prepared paste, egg-brushed 
as before. For custard or pumpkin she usually prepared the paste by 
setting the pan on top of the stove until the crust was nearly cooked 
through, then adding the custard and putting it at once into a hot oven. 
When sweet cider is at hand, it may be used to give additional flavor to 
an apple pie. Warm half a cupful of cider and, 10 minutes before the 
pie is taken from the oven, pour the cider into it through the hole in the 
center of top crust, using a little funnel of stiff paper to prevent splashing. 

Appleless Apple Pie. — Soak two large soda crackers in a large cup of 
boiling water. Add small piece butter. When cool add two tablespoon- 
fuls vinegar, one cup sugar, a few raisins and a little nutmeg. Bake with 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 43 

two crusts as you do the real apple pie. Another appleless apple pie is 
made from pumpkins as follows : Procure a good sound pumpkin (or 
squash), wash, cut a round of same, as deep as an ordinary apple is, from 
stem to blossom end; peel, cut down crosswise in slices about an eighth 
of an inch thick; put in water enough to cover, and stew slowly until 
tender, but not mushy. Lift carefully from the water, let cool. Prepare 
crust as for apple pie, line your tins with the crust, place your slices of 
pumpkin just as you would slices of apple; sprinkle over them a little 
flour — not over a tablespoonful of sugar; add one tablespoonful of pure 
cider vinegar to each pie, a few lumps of butter, finish with a top crust. 
Bake to a rich brown color in a moderate oven. 

Vermont Blackberry Pie. — Line a deep dripping pan with pastry, cover 
the bottom with a generous layer of blackberries, sprinkle with sugar and 
cover with a crust. Bake, then add another layer of blackberries and 
sugar, cover with a top crust, and then bake again. This is recommended 
as highly delicious, either hot or cold. 

Buttermilk Pie. — Beat together a heaping cupful of sugar and four 
eggs; add half a cupful of butter; beat thoroughly and add V/^ pint of 
fresh buttermilk; line pie tins with crust; slice an apple thin and lay 
in each pie; fill crust with the mixture and bake with one crust. 

Butterscotch Pie. — Two eggs, one cup brown sugar, butter size of 
walnut, tablespoon of flour, one cup cream, one teaspoon vanilla. Cream 
the butter, sugar and flour together, add the beaten yolks, cream and 
flavoring. Pour this into a good baked pie crust and return to the oven. 
When it has thickened spread over it the whites beaten very stiff, with 
two level tablespoons of sugar. Have the oven quite cool while the 
meringue is browning. 

Carrot Pie.— Scrape the skin off the carrots, boil them soft and strain 
them through a sieve. To a pint of the strained pulp put three pints of 
milk, six beaten eggs, two tablespoonfuls of melted butter, the juice of 
half a lemon and the grated rind of a whole one. Sweeten it to your 
taste, and bake it in deep pie plates without an upper Crust. 

Cheese Cakes. — This is a rich English dainty. Take four ounces of 
butter, and cream it in a warm pan ; add four ounces of sugar, beat well ; 
add the yolk of one egg, beat again, then add one whole egg; beat all 
well together, and mix in four ounces of currants. Line patty pans 
with paste, fill with the mixture, shake a little sugar over the top, and bake. 

Curd Cheese Cakes. — Add one egg to one cupful of fresh curd; beat 
smooth, and beat in one-half cupful of sugar, and a piece of butter the 
size of a walnut. Flavor with nutmeg or any other spice, and use as 
filling for a pie without top crust. A richer curd cheese cake is made 
by using the recipe given for ordinary cheese cakes, and beating the curd 
into it before the currants are added. 



44 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Chocolate Pie. — Line a deep pie pan with rich pie crust and bake in a 
quick oven. Grate one-half teacupful of chocolate and put into a sauce- 
pan, with one cupful of hot water, butter the size of an egg, one table- 
spoonful vanilla, one cupful of sugar, the beaten yolk of two eggs and 
two tablespoonfuls of cornstarch, dissolved in a little water; mix well; 
cook until thick, stirring constantly. Pour into the pie shell and let cool. 
Beat the whites of the two eggs to a stiff froth, add two tablespoonfuls 
of powdered sugar, spread on top of pie and slightly brown in oven. 

Cider Jelly Pie. — This is a tested old-fashioned recipe. A half pint of 
boiled cider, a cupful of brown sugar, a cupful of boiling water and two 
tablespoonfuls of cornstarch. Stir the cornstarch into the cider, add the 
other ingredients and cook for 10 minutes. Fill into a pastry-lined pie 
tin and cover with an upper crust. 

Cream Pie. — Mix thoroughly two cups of flour and five tablespoonfuls 
of butter, then add three tablespoonfuls of sugar and one large egg, which 
has been thoroughly beaten together previously. Roll an eighth of an inch 
thick, line two pie tins, prick with a folk and bake a pale brown, then 
fill with this cream: Two cups milk, two tablespoonfuls of cornstarch, 
five tablespoonfuls of sugar, yolks of five eggs. Cook together like cus- 
tard, and when cold cover with meringue made of whites of five eggs and 
five tablespoons powdered sugar. 

New England Cream Tart Pie. — Select firm Esopus apples and make 
as dry an apple sauce as possible, sweetened slightly and strained. For 
a large-sized pie use one pint of apple, one pint of thick cream, yolks of 
two eggs beaten stiff, and one-half of a nutmeg. An under crust only 
is used, and this may be baked the day before. Fill and bake about one- 
half hour. Use the whites of two eggs for the meringue and brown in 
the oven. Greenings are gOod for this pie when Esopus is not at hand, 
but apples of low quality should not be used for it. 

Crumb Pie. — Soak a pint of bread crumbs in milk. Beat three eggs ; 
add half a cup of sugar. Line two pie plates with crust and strew over 
enough raisins to cover bottom. Add the bread crumbs to egg and milk, 
sifting in a bit of cinnamon, pour over the raisins and bake about 30 
minutes. 

Date Pie. — For one pie take one heaping cupful of pastry flour, add a 
pinch of salt and mix to the right consistency with sweet cream. The 
crust will be much nicer if allowed to get very cold before using. Filling 
— To a cupful of seeded dates add a cupful of water, cook over hot water 
about 20 minutes, then rub through a sieve. Beat an egg and a table- 
spoonful of sugar until light; add a tablespoonful of lemon juice, the 
date paste and gradually a cupful of scalded milk. Pour into a half 
baked shell and finish baking in a moderate oven until a knife blade 
can penetrate it and come out clean. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 45 

Delectable Tarts. — One cup of slightly sour cream, one cup of seeded 
and chopped raisins, one cup of sugar and one egg with a delicate flavor- 
ing of spices. Beat the egg light, add the cream and sugar; the raisins 
well floured and spices. Bake in tart or patty pans with a single crust. 

Elderberry Pie. — Line a pie dish with paste, upon which sprinkle a 
scant tablespoonful of flour; to this add a half cup of sugar and a half 
teaspoonful each of cloves and cinnamon, rubbing all together evenly. 
Upon this pour the berries, a pint more or less according to the size of 
your pie dish; pour oVer another half cup of sugar, dot generously with 
butter, adding last one large tablespoonful of good vinegar. Apply top 
crust quickly and bake. 

Grape Cobbler. — This is best made from very ripe black grapes. Wash 
them twice — on the bunches and after picking. Line a deep pie dish with 
half-inch rich. crust, put in the grapes and all the sugar that will lie 
between them, heaping the fruit a little in the middle. Put on the top 
crust, cut cross slits in the middle and fold back the corners to leave 
an open square. Set the dish in a quick oven and while the pie bakes 
make a sauce, using half a cup of butter, one cup of sugar and one table- 
spoon boiling water. Stir well over hot water and flavor with lemon 
juice, or grated nutmeg, according to taste. When the pie is nearly done 
take it out, pour in the sauce through the opening in the crust, return 
it to the oven. Be careful not to overbake, but keep it hot until served. 

Grape Roll. — Allow half the weight of the grapes in sugar and only 
water enough to keep from burning; seed the grapes; allow one pint of 
cooked grapes for the roll. To make the dough cream one-half teacupful 
of butter with one pint of sifted flour; add one teacupful of milk, two 
eggs -well beaten, a saltspoonful of salt and a teaspoonful of baking 
powder; roll out on the board in two long ovals, roll up and pinch the 
ends, lay in a buttered dish, set the dish to bake and twice pour over 
them a sauce of a tablespoonful of butter and a tablespoonful of sugar 
mixed together, to which is added one-half teacupful of boiling water 
(for one basting). Serve the rolls with the same kind of sauce made 
richer and flavored with nutmeg. 

Green Apple Slump. — Stew and strain a quart of green apples and 
sweeten to taste. Make a biscuit crust with two cupfuls of flour, one 
heaping teaspoonful of baking powder, one tablespoonful of butter and 
one-half teaspoonful of salt, and moisten with sweet milk to a dough. 
Roll out one inch thick. Put the prepared hot sauce in a thick-bottomed 
saucepan, fit over it the crust and cover closely, first buttering the inside 
of the cover. Place where the sauce will simmer slowly but steadily 
for an hour. In serving put the crust on the dish, pour the sauce over 
it and serve with cream. 



46 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Hasty Pie. — Place in a deep baking pan or dish any fresh or canned 
fruits to the depth of two or three inches. Beat together one egg, two 
tablespoonfuls of melted butter, one cupful sweet milk and one cupful of 
flour in which has been sifted one teaspoonful of baking powder. Pour 
this over fruit and bake until crust is well done. Eat with sweetened 
cream or any pudding sauce. Use but little syrup with fruit. The same 
recipe for batter makes good muffins. 

Jam Dumplings. — To one quart of sifted flour 3dd two heaping tea- 
spoonfuls of baking powder, half teaspoonful of salt and four table- 
spoonfuls of sugar and sift several times. Beat two eggs light and add 
to a cup of milk; stir into the flour, adding a large tablespoonful of 
butter melted; add enough milk to make a soft dough; roll out, cut in 
squares, put a large spoonful of jam in center of each square, pinch the 
edges together, place them in a baking pan and bake them for 35 minutes ; 
serve with vanilla sauce. 

Lady Lufkins. — Make a very rich, flaky pie crust, roll out very thin, 
cut into strips an inch wide, and wind each strip around a tube of metal 
or heavy manilla paper about two inches wide; bake until crisp and brown. 
This is the way in which bakers make their cream rolls. When cold, fill 
each roll with marmalade in the center and cream at the ends. 

Lemon Meringue.- — Stir together the juice and rind of one lemon, one 
cupful of sugar, three-quarters of a cupful of water with one tablespoon- 
ful of cornstarch, and the yolks of four eggs. Bake in one crust and 
make a meringue of the four whites for the top, adding a little powdered 
sugar after having been stiffly beaten. If desired the whites of the eggs 
may be included in the filling, and two crusts used. 

Lemon Mince Pie. — Stir together two tablespoonfuls cornstarch thor- 
oughly cooked with a cupful of water, one cupful of sugar, one cupful of 
molasses, one cupful of chopped raisins, a little citron, the juice of two 
lemons, and the grated rind of one. Bake in two crusts. This makes 
several pies. 

Delicious Lemon Pie. — Beat one cup sugar, three tablespoons of flour, 
the yolks of two eggs, piece of butter size of a walnut, to a cream. Add 
the grated rind and juice of a lemon, then one cup of milk, gradually. 
Then fold in the whites of the eggs beaten to a froth. Bake in one crust. 

Maple Custard Pie. — Line a pie pan with any good paste. For the 
filling beat together the yolks of three eggs and one pint of cream; add 
one-third cup maple sugar shaved fine. Stir until the sugar is dissolved 
and bake in a quick oven. Delicious. 

Marlborough Pie. — Line a pie plate with very thin puff paste. Take 
half cup of mixed orange, lemon and citron peel. Strew these in the 
bottom of the dish. Beat the yolks of four eggs with a cup of butter and 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 47 

scant cup of sugar. Heat in a double boiler until melted; then flavor with 
orange juice and little grated peel. -Pour into the dish and bake three- 
quarters of an hour. 

. Milk Pie. — Line a pan eight inches in diameter with good paste, put 
dots of butter over the bottom until you have used about the size of a 
walnut, dredge over alternately flour to the amount of one-fourth meas- 
uring cup and sugar to the amount of one-half cup, then sprinkle evenly 
over the top one level dessertspoon of cinnamon and pour in carefully, 
so as not to disturb the cinnamon, three-fourths cup milk and bake until 
crust is brown. 

Maryland Mincemeat. — Two pounds of lean beef; cook, let get cold, 
and pass through meat grinder; mix thoroughly with one pint of finely- 
minced suet, two quarts of chopped, high-flavored apples, one pint of 
stoned raisins, a scant pint of sugar, one-half pint of currants, one-third 
pound of citron shaved in fine shreds, a cupful of molasses (which is 
omitted if preferred, sugar taking its place), one tablespoonful each of 
ground mace and allspice, two tablespoonfuls of cinnamon, one-half table- 
spoonful of cloves, two grated nutmegs, one and a half tablespoonful of 
salt, juice and rind of one and a half lemon, same of sour orange, 
one-half cupful each of candied lemon and orange peel. Moisten with 
unfermented grape juice, sweet cider, peach or plum syrup. The syrup 
from sweet pickles is a great improvement. Pack solid in airtight jars. 

Green Tomato Mincemeat. Chop fine four quarts of green tomatoes, 
drain off all juice, cover with cold water, let come to a boil and scald 
for 30 minutes, then drain well. Add two pounds of brown sugar, one 
pound of seeded raisins, one-half pound of chopped citron, one largS 
half cupful of finely-chopped suet, one tablespoonful of salt and one-half 
cupful of strong cider vinegar. Stir well together and cook till thick. 
When cold add one teaspootiful each of ground cinnamon and cloves and 
one teaspoonful of grated nutmeg. Stir thoroughly and keep (while it 
lasts) in a stone jar. 

Mock Mince Pie with Cranberries. — ^One cupful bread crumbs, one 
cupful raisins, one cupful sugar, one cupful cranberries cut in halves, one 
level saltspoonful each of cinnamon, cloves, allspice and nutmeg, one cup- 
ful hot water, one-half cup vinegar and butter size of a large English 
walnut. Turn into a pie tin lined with flaky paste, place the top crust 
and bake in a brisk oven. 

Mock Pumpkin Pie. — Grate sweet apples, add milk, sugar, ginger and 
cinnamon, and one egg for each pie. Make the filling of the same con- 
sistency as pumpkin, and bake just like it. 

Peach Turnovers. — ^One pint of dried peaches stewed and sweetened 
with two tablespoonfuls of brown sugar; flavor with nutmeg to taste. 



48 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Make a stiff crust, not as short as for other pies. Roll out pieces the 
size of a saucer. Cover one-half of the crust one-half inch deep with 
the stewed fruit. Fold over, pinch the edges together and prick with a 
silver fork. Fry like doughnuts, preferably in cooking oil; powder with 
sugar and serve with maple syrup. 

Pear Puffs. — Peel good pears, cut out the .blossom end, but leave the 
stem; simmer the pears until tender in a weak syrup flavored with 
lemon, then drain, and allow them to cool. Make a good, rich pie crust, 
roll out thin, cut into triangular pieces, and cover each pear, pinching the 
crust neatly together, but leaving the stem protruding. Bake in a quick 
oven to a pale brown, and serve hot or cold. 

Prune Pie. — Stew half pound of prunes as for sauce. When quite soft 
remove the stones, sweeten, beat up and gradually fold in the whites of 
two eggs. Line deep pie tins with crust and bake twenty minutes. Then 
turn in the prune mixture; spread smoothly on top and pour over this 
a layer of well-sweetened and well-flavored apple sauce. Place in oven 
and bake twenty minutes longer. Eat hot or cold. 

Prune Pie No. 2. — One cupful of stewed and stoned prunes, chopped 
fine; three tablespoonfuls of the syrup in which they were stewed, two 
eggs, yolks and white beaten separately, the whites to a stiff froth ; sugar, 
salt and flavoring to taste. The prunes should be soaked an hour or two 
in warm water before stewing, then cooked slowly several hours, putting 
them on with cold water enough nearly to cover them and enough sugar 
to make a rich syrup. Bake without upper crust. 

Prune Pie No. 3. — Cover a pie tin with rich crust, and then half fill 
with a layer of stewed prunes and their juice, the stones having been 
removed. Over the prunes pour a custard, made by beating up one egg 
and a teacupful of milk, a little nutmeg being grated over the top. The 
pie is baked until the custard is set. Little patty pans lined with pie crust 
and filled with the same material, are prune fanchonettes. 

Pumpkin Pie. — This recipe differs decidedly from those ordinarily used 
and is very good. Cut the pumpkin without paring, bake it, skin side 
down, until tender, and then scoop out the pulp and sift it. For one 
pie allow lyi cupful of pumpkin, one cupful of boiling milk, one teaspoon- 
ful of butter, half a cupful of sugar, half a teaspoonful of salt, one- 
quarter teaspoonful of cinnamon, same amount of ginger; add one egg, 
beaten separately. Half bake the crust, fill with the pumpkin and bake. 

Pumpkin Pie Without Eggs. — Let the pumpkin be of the pie variety, 
small, close-grained, and sweet. Steam it until tender, then press through 
a colander. To a pint of sifted pumpkin add one quart of rich milk, two 
level tablespoonfuls flour, one cupful sugar, two teaspoonfuls ginger and a 
pinch of salt. This is suflScient for two pies. Fill the crusts, sift on a 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 49 

little sugar and a dust of nutmeg, and bake. If the pumpkin is not up to 
the standard, one egg may be added, but not as a substitute for the flour, 
which gives body and smoothness to the filling. 

Raisin Pie. — One cupful of nice raisins ; wash quickly, cover with 
boiling water, cook until tender; remove seeds; moisten a cupful of bread 
crumbs with the water, add one-fourth cupful of sugar, one egg (beaten), 
one tablespoonful lemon juice and the raisins, cut in two or three pieces 
each; an upper and lower crust of tender pastry and a satisfactory bake 
make a most delicious pie. 

Raisin Pie No. 2. — Boil one pound of seeded raisins in sufficient water 
to cover for one hour. Then add the juice and grated rind of one lemon, 
a piece of butter the size of an egg, one cupful of sugar, and two table- 
spoonfuls of cornstarch. Bake in two crusts. This makes filling for two 
pies. A second way of making a pie is to cook one cupful of raisins in 
one cupful of water until they are softened, add the grated rind and juice 
of one lemon, half a cupful of sugar, a sifting of cinnamon and sufficient 
powdered cracker crumbs to thicken. Bake in two crusts. 

Raisin Turnovers. — One cupful of seeded raisins, the rind of a lemon, 
or a few pieces of candied lemon or orange peel, and a small piece of 
preserved citron, chop all together finely, stir into this one beaten egg, 
and the juice of one lemon. Roll out puff paste thinly, and cut it in 
circles, lay them on a plate, fill with the mixture, then cover and press 
the edges firmly together. Bake the same length of time as you would 
a pie. 

Raspberry Cream Tart. — ^Line a pie plate with good paste, and fill with 
red raspberries, sweetened with powdered sugar. Cover with paste, but 
do not pinch it down at the edges. When it is done, lift the top crust, 
which is thicker than usual, and pour upon the fruit a cream made as 
follows : One small cup of rich milk, heated to boiling point ; whites of 
two eggs beaten light and stirred into the boiling milk; one tablespoonful 
of white sugar; one-half teaspoonful of cornstarch wetted with cold 
milk. Boil three minutes, then let the cream get perfectly cold. Remove 
the top crust, pour the cream over the fruit, replace the crust, and set 
the pie away to cool. This recipe is given by Marion Harland ; our home 
recipe for fruit creara pie calls for a simple custard, using both white and 
yolk of one egg, which is poured over the fruit as above. Strawberry 
cream pie is made in the same way. 

Rhubarb Pie. — Cut in rather coarse pieces enough rhubarb to fill a 
large cup. Beat one egg thoroughly, adding a good pinch of salt, add 
the rhubarb, one cup of sugar and two soda crackers rolled fine. Mix 
thoroughly, then turn into a pie tin lined with pastry. Put a few bits of 
butter over it here and there, add a grating of nutmeg, and bake as a 



50 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

tart pie, bands of pastry laid over the top before baking. This quantity 
makes one pie — a small deep one, or a thin large one. 

Rhubarb Cream Pie. — One cupful of rhubarb chopped fine or grated, 
one cupful of sugar, a pinch of salt, a grating of nutmeg or lemon peel. 
Moisten a tablespoonful of cornstarch with a tablespoonful of cold water; 
then fill the cup up with boiling water, stirring until clear. Beat the 
yolks of three eggs until light, and add them with the cornstarch to the 
other materials. Line a pie plate with good light paste, fill with the 
mixture and bake in a moderately hot oven until custard is set. When 
done and cooled, cover with a meringue made with the whites of the 
eggs and half a cupful of confectioner's sugar. Brown delicately in 
the oven. 

Fresh Strawberry Pie. — Bake an empty bottom crust, making it extra 
nice; prick holes all over the bottom and sides, to prevent its getting 
out of shape. As soon as baked sprinkle the inside with sugar and fill 
with ripe berries; also well dredge with sugar.- Cover with sweetened 
whipped cream and then cover all with a meringue of the frothed whites 
of two eggs mixed with two tablespoonfuls of sugar and a dash of 
lemon juice. Invert a plate in the oven and place the pie plate on top 
of it and brown. If the work is very carefully done the berries will not 
be even heated, and the result will be delicious. The pie should be 
thoroughly chilled before serving. 

Strawberry Pie No. 3. — Line a pie tin with rich crust shortened with 
butter, no baking powder being used. Let it cool, then fill with fresh 
strawberries, hulled and washed, and mixed with sugar. Cover with 
whipped cream and serve. 

Strawberry Pie No. 3.— Line a pie plate with good short crust, fill 
with ripe whole berries, liberally sugared, and then cover with a lattice 
formed of criss-cross strips of crust. By the time the crust is browned 
the berries are cooked in their own rich juice, and the pie is much 
nicer than with an ordinary double crust. 

Strawberry Cream Pie. — After picking over the berries carefully, 
arrange them in layers in a deep pie plate, sprinkling sugar thickly 
between each layer, having first lined the dish with your best pastry. 
Cover with a crust with a slit in the top and bake. When the pie is 
baked, pour into the slit in the top of the pie the following cream mix- 
ture: Take a small cupful of rich cream, heat until nearly boiling, then 
stir into it the whites of two eggs beaten lightly to a froth, also a table- 
spoonful of granulated or powdered sugar; boil all together a few 
moments. When cool, pour it into the pie through the slit in the crust. 
Serve with powdered sugar sifted on top. 



CHAPTER V. 

PUDDINGS, HOT AND COLD. 

The proof of the pudding Is not in the eating, 
Never mind what the old sayings state ; 

The compliment setting the cook's heart a'beating 
Is the call for a big second plate. 

As a rule farm housekeepers are admirably situated for making 
delicious puddings, many of which are more wholesome than pastry. 
The recipes given below include considerable variety, and will be found 
suggestive, as many may be altered to suit material on hand. We were 
obliged to omit a number of good ones, owing to lack of space. 

Apricot Pudding. — This may be made from evaporated apricots, care- 
fully soaked and stewed, instead of the canned fruit. Butter a shallow 
pudding dish and sprinkle on the surface a layer of soft bread crumbs. 
Drain the syrup from a can of apricots and arrange a layer of fruit in 
the dish. Fill the cavities with sugar and a dot of butter the size of a 
pea on each. Cover each piece of fruit with another half to simulate the 
whole fruit, then fill the interstices with soft bread crumbs. Mix one pint 
of milk, the yolks of three eggs, well beaten, with one-quarter teaspoon 
of salt and three teaspoonfuls sugar, and pour this over the fruit. Lift 
the fruit a little so the custard may reach every part of the bread. Bake 
it about half an hour. Beat the whites of the eggs till stiff; add three 
heaped tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar and three teaspoonfuls of 
lemon juice. When the pudding is done and cooked somewhat spread 
the meringue over the top and brown it slightly. Serve hot without sauce. 

Batter Pudding. — This is an old-fashioned recipe, which can be 
depended upon. Measure 12 tablespoonfuls of flour after sifting; then 
sift again with a teaspoonful of baking powder and a small one of salt. 
Beat four eggs, without separating, until very light and before mixing 
them to a batter with a quart of milk, butter a three-pint oval baking 
dish and see that the oven is of a steady heat, as if for baking bread. 
Now make a smooth batter with the milk and flour, stirring in the eggs 
last, and bake about one hour. The pudding will rise with a brown crust 
on top, and, by the slow baking, the sides and bottom will also be crisp 
and brown, while the interior will be tender and light. Serve directly 
from the oven, with fruit juice slightly thickened for sauce. No other 
sauce will take the place of this. When the supply of extra juice canned 
for this very purpose is exhausted, evaporated cherries soaked over night 
and well simmered in the same water is an excellent substitute. 



53 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Black Pudding. — One coflfeecup black molasses, one coffeecup sour 
cream; add one dessertspoon of soda and beat hard and then add one 
cup chopped suet, one cup seeded raisins, a few almonds (about a table- 
spoonful), do not blanch them, as they will have a better flavor, three 
(or more if liked) chopped figs, two apples, and a piece of citron 
chopped. Three cups of flour, one-half teaspoonful of salt and the grat- 
ing of one-half nutmeg. Beat well. Take four baking powder cans 
(pound size), rub with melted butter and pour the batter into them and 
steam hard three hours. Stand in oven ten or fifteen minutes to dry oil. 
When you wish to use steam half an hour. A quantity may be made at 
one time, as these puddings will keep six months. 

Blackberry Pudding. — Beat one-third of a cup of butter to a cream. 
Add gradually half a cup of sugar and the beaten yolks of two eggs. 
Sift together two cups of previously sifted flour, four level teaspoonfuls 
of baking powder and half a teaspoonful of salt. Add this to the 
creamed butter, sugar, and eggs. Put in half of the flour mixture, mix, 
and then put in half a cupful of cold water. Mix in the rest of the 
flour, etc. Beat thoroughly and last of all fold in the well-beaten whites 
of the two eggs. Sprinkle a cupful of blackberries with a little flour 
and add them to the batter as it is dropped a spoonful at a time, into the 
mold, which should be rubbed with unsalted butter. Steam an hour and 
a half, or bake twenty-five minutes, and serve with a blackberry hard 
sauce. The sauce is made in the usual way, with half a cup of butter 
and a cup of sugar. Add to this half a cupful of crushed berries. 

Blueberry Betty. — Put a pint of milk in a double boiler and put on 
the fire to scald. Pick over, wash and drain a pint of fresh blueberries. 
Have ready a pint of soft whole wheat bread crumbs. Put a layer of 
crumbs in a buttered pudding dish, then a layer of berries, then more 
crumbs and so on until the dish is full, having crumbs on top. Stir two 
tablespoonfuls of sugar in the milk, and when hot pour it over the con- 
tents of the dish. Cover and set in the oven to bake for about an hour. 
Stand the pudding dish in a basin of hot water. Serve with a tart sauce. 

Blueberry Pudding. — Beat V/2 cupful sugar with four eggs, add one 
pint milk and one cupful flour, in which sift one tablespoonful baking 
powder, one-half teaspoonful salt ; add one cupful whole blueberries ; pour 
in a buttered covered mold; set in boiling water, letting water only 
come a little more than half way up to the mold; weight* down and boil 
continuously for one hour; slip on to a dish and cover with sauce, then 
sprinkle over uncooked fruit. Sauce — Beat one cupful granulated sugar 
with one cupful butter to a cream; then add yolks of two eggs, one- 
quarter teaspoonful vanilla. 

Baked Blueberry Pudding. — One quart ripe, fresh berries, mace or 
nutmeg one-half teaspoonful; three eggs well beaten, separately; sugar, 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 53 

two cups; cold butter, one tablespoon; sweet milk, one cup; flour, one 
pint; baking powder, two teaspoons. Roll berries well in flour, add 
them last. Bake half hour and serve with sauce. Delicious. 

Steamed Blueberry Puffs. — Beat two eggs until light and thick, with- 
out separating; add half a cupful of sugar and half a cupful of milk; 
sift together three level teaspoonfuls of baking powder, half a teaspoon- 
ful of salt and two cupfuls of flour, stir into the liquid ingredients; then 
stir in one cup of blueberries. Turn into buttered cups and steam half 
an hour. The batter should drop easily from the end of the spoon. 
Serve hot with cream and sugar. 

Bread and Butter Pudding. — Strew half a cupful of currants in the 
bottom of a baking dish, then butter some slices of freshly-baked bread 
and lay in the dish. Make a custard with two eggs and a pint of milk, 
sweeten to taste, arid pour it over; grate a little nutmeg over the top and 
bake a light brown. This pudding should be baked in the dish in which 
it is to be sent to table. It is delicious eaten with stewed fruit. 

Steamed Bread and Butter Pudding. — Butter a small pudding bowl. 
Cut some thin bread and butter, decorate the bottom of the basin with 
candied peel cut in stars, or a few raisins or preserved cherries; put in 
the slices of bread and butter, dusting each slice with sugar and sprinkling 
with a few chopped preserved cherries. When full beat up an egg with 
half a pint of milk, flavor with essence of almonds, and strain over the 
pudding. Leave to soak for a while, cover with buttered paper, and 
steam for an hour and a quarter. Turn out, and serve with custard. 

Bread Pudding in Disguise. — Break half a loaf of bread into pieces 
and soak in milk, just what the bread will take up. Then add an egg 
and a cup of sugar and a cup of rich, creamy milk in which put half 
teaspoonful of saleratus and teaspoonful of cream of tartar. Bake until 
light and well browned in a medium oven. To serve pour a little maple 
syrup over each dish. 

Brown Betty. — Mix a cupful of sugar and a level teaspoonful of 
cinnamon. Prepare about a quart of sliced tart apples. Stir into a pint 
of soft bread crumbs about half a cupful of melted butter. Butter well 
a deep pudding dish, put in a layer of crumbs, then sliced apples and 
sprinkle with sugar, then another layer of crumbs, apples and sugar and 
continue until the materials are used with a thick layer of crumbs on the 
top. Bake about an hour in a moderate oven. If the oven browns on 
the bottom set in a pan of hot water or bake on the top grate of the oven, 
covering the pudding well to prevent too crisp an upper crust. Serve 
with hard sauce made as follows : Cream a third of a cupful of butter, 
add gradually a cupful of powdered sugar and when beaten to a cream 
add drop by drop to prevent separation, two tablespoonfuls of rich cream. 
Flavor with vanilla or lemon juice. 



54 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Carrot Pudding. — Mix together one cupful of grated bread crumbs, 
a quarter of a pound each of flour and of butter, one-half pound of 
preserved cherries, and one-half pound of sugar and a saltspoonful of 
salt. Boil six young carrots until they are tender, then pass them 
through a sieve and add half a pound of this pulp to the other ingredi- 
ents. Stir the mixture well, then steam it in a buttered mold for 3J4 
hours. In the Winter we make an imitation plum pudding in which a 
cupful of grated carrot is used, the carrot both lightening and 
enriching it. 

Cherry Cups. — Measure a pint of sifted flour, add two teaspoonfuls 
of baking powder and half a teaspoonful of salt and sift again. Mix to 
a soft dough with cold water. Butter little custard cups and drop in a 
little of the dough and then add a teaspoonful of the cherries ; cover 
these with more dough (the cups should not be more than half full). 
Set the cups in a steamer, or if you have no steamer you can put them 
in a deep baking pan with a little boiling water; cover closely with 
another pan and steam half an hour in the oven. Eat with cherry sauce 
or sweetened cream. On bread baking day you can make these with 
bread dough instead of the baking powder dough. 

Cherry Batter Pudding. — Prepare a cupful of stoned cherries. Beat 
two eggs separately, add half a pint of milk, or better still, sweet cream, 
to the yolks, and to this one tablespoonful of melted butter. Have ready 
l}/2 cupful of flour, into which two teaspoonfuls of baking powder have 
been sifted, with a dash of salt. Add this to the yolks of the eggs and 
milk, and lastly add the whites of the eggs, beaten light. Beat vigor- 
ously for a few minutes and turn into a greased baking pan, allowing the 
batter to be about an inch thick. Cover it with the cherries, add one-third 
of a cup of granulated sugar, sprinkled lightly on the top, and bake in a 
quick oven for 30 minutes. Serve hot with hard sauce or a sauce made 
from a cup of cherries and half a cup of sugar stewed together until the 
cherries are reduced to a pulp. Sauce as well as pudding should be 
served hot. 

Boiled Cherry Pudding. — Beat three eggs light without separating; add 
a pint of milk. Sift two teaspoonfuls of baking powder and a half a 
teaspoonful of salt in a little less than a quart of sifted flour and add the 
liquid gradually to the flour, stirring to a smooth batter. Add a teaspoon- 
ful of melted butter. Beat thoroughly and then stir in a pint of cherries, 
, stoned and drained free from juice and well floured. Turn into a well- 
buttered pudding dish or mold, or an old-fashioned pudding bag, scalded 
and floured, and cook in a kettle of boiling water for three hours. Keep 
the water boiling continually or the pudding will be heavy. If cooked 
in a mold or dish, the water must not be deep enough to boil over the 
pudding. If in a bag, there must be sufficient water to keep the pudding 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 55 

from touching the bottom of the kettle. Serve with hard or foamy sauce. 
Cherry Pudding in Winter. — Nearly fill a buttered baking dish with 
the sour canned cherries. Use just enough of the juice so the cherries 
will be moist. Spread over this a dough made from one-fourth teacupful 
sugar, one tablespoonful butter, one-half cupful milk, one egg, a little 
salt, one cupful flour (use a little more if necessary to make dough like 
cake), one teaspoonful baking powder. Bake half an hour. Sauce to 
serve with it is made as follows : One-half cupful butter, one-half cupful 
sugar, one tablespoonful of flour or cornstarch. Mix thoroughly. To this 
add a pint of the cherry juice. Boil till it thickens. 

Canned Cherry Tapioca. — Cover a scant cupful of tapioca with cold 
water and let it soak over night. In the morning place over the fire with 
a saltspoonful of salt and a pint of boiling water; simmer slowly until 
the tapioca is perfectly clear. Stir a pint of stoned cherries into the 
boiling tapioca; add a cupful of sugar (more if the cherries are very 
sour) ; turn into a serving dish and set away to cool. Serve with 
whipped cream. 

Chocolate Pudding. — Put into a bowl two cupfuls of stale bread- 
crumbs. Pour over them one quart of scalded milk. While the bread 
and milk are cooling melt two squares of chocolate. Mix the chocolate 
with two-thirds of a cup of sugar, then, with two eggs, lightly beaten, one 
scant saltspoonful of salt and a teaspoonful of vanilla. Add the milk 
and breadcrumbs and then, when well mixed, turn the whole into a pud- 
ding dish that has been buttered and sugared. Bake it one hour in a 
moderately hot oven. Serve cold, with cream. This pudding can be 
baked in individual molds if preferred. 

Steamed Chocolate Pudding. — Boil one quart of fresh milk and pour 
over one pint grated bread crumbs, one-fourth cake grated chocolate, one 
cup sugar, one cup flour, one cup butter, two teaspoons baking powder, 
one cup raisins, one cup chopped nuts. Steam two hours and serve with 
a sauce. 

Chocolate Tapioca. — Soak three tablespoonfuls of tapioca in a cup of 
cold water for half an hour; add three pints of hot milk, one cupful of 
sugar, yolks of two eggs and three tablespoonfuls of grated chocolate. 
Cook in a double boiler until the tapioca is tender. Serve with a meringue 
made from the whites of two eggs and powdered sugar or whipped cream. 

Cider Pudding. — Mix a cupful of cider, a cupful of molasses, a cupful 
of suet, a cupful of seeded raisins, half a teaspoonful of salt, one tea- 
spoonful of soda and flour enough to make a stiff batter. Steam three 
hours. 

Baked Cider Pudding. — Cream 1^ tablespoonful butter, add three 
tablespoonfuls granulated sugar and one egg. Beat all together until 
very light. Add- half a cupful of cider. Into one cup of flour put one- 



56 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

half teaspoonful cinnamon, one-quarter teaspoonful of ground cloves. 
Sift this into the batter and add a quarter cupful each of currants and 
Sultana raisins mixed with a quarter cupful of flour. Add one-quarter 
teaspoonful baking soda with the last bit of flour and beat briskly for 
a minute or two. Pour into a well-greased mold and steam one hour 
and a half; turn out carefully, as the texture is delicate, and serve hot 
with orange sauce. 

Cider Bread Pudding. — Butter freely several slices of light bread. 
Place a layer in pudding dish, cover with a few slices of tart apples ; 
repeat until the dish is full. To a quart of good cider add a cup of 
sugar and pour over. Bake slowly and serve either hot or cold with 
cream. 

Citron Pudding. — A quart of fresh milk, a pint of stale bread crumbs, 
carefully grated, four eggs, a coffee cup of powdered sugar, half a pound 
of citron cut fine, a small amount of butter and the juice and rind of 
one lemon. The yolks and sugar are beaten together and the bread 
crumbs, milk and lemon rind added by degrees. This is poured into a 
buttered dish, the citron dropped in and a piece of butter placed over 
all. The baking required half an hour and the preparation when cold 
is covered with a meringue made of four whites, a cup of powdered 
sugar and the juice of a lemon. This is browned slightly before serving. 

Cocoanut Pudding. — O'ne-half cupful of cocoanut, one-half cupful of 
bread crumbs, one pint of milk, one egg, one tablespoonful of butter, 
two tablespoonfuls of sugar and one level saltspoonful of salt. Soak 
the bread crumbs and cocoanut in the milk for three hours ; mash the 
bread fine, and add the sugar, salt and melted butter. Beat the white 
and yolk of the egg separately, and add first the yolk and then the white, 
stirring well. Place all in a well-buttered pudding dish and bake half 
an hour. Serve hot without sauce. 

Coffee Pudding. — Boil three-fourths of a cup of ground coffee in 
one quart water 10 minutes; then add one-half ounce gelatine which 
had been soaked 15 minutes; then add one cup sugar; boil one minute; 
then strain through a cloth, set aside to get cold; when almost jellied 
beat one-half pint cream till near stiff, then add the* coffee jelly, gradu- 
ally beating all the time. When all is well mixed flavor with vanilla, 
and set in a cold place to harden. It can be served alone, or with cream. 
The recipe is enough for six people. 

Colonial Pudding.^When baking bread put a piece of the dough into 
a pound baking powder tin and bake this for the top of the pudding. 
Soak some slices of Boston brown bread in scalded milk for two hours. 
Then beat up well, add a cupful of raisins, a little chopped mixed peel, 
half a teaspoonful of mixed spice, half a cupful of sugar, and two ounces 
pf teef suet, chopped very fine, or a piece of butter the size of an egg. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 57 

Mix all well together, adding cold milk as you mix it, and then put into 
a buttered baking dish. A lound, shallow dish is the best to use, and 
it should also be one that can be sent to the table. Now cut the white 
bread into slices, butter them, and lay them closely together on the top. 
of the pudding mixture. Grate a little nutmeg over all, and bake in a 
moderate oven for an hour and a half, covering it for an hour and 
taking off the cover for the half hour so that it may be a nice light brown. 

Cottage Pudding. — One cup sugar, two eggs, one pint sweet milk, two 
scant teaspoons baking powder, flavoring and flour to make a batter as 
stiff as cake dough. Bake three-quarters of an hour in a moderate 
oven and serve with milk or hot sauce. To make hot sauce cream 
together one tablespoon butter and two of flour with half cup of sugar. 
Slowly add enough boiling water to make it thin and smooth. Then 
proceed to add boiling water to make it the consistency of thin starch. 
Boil a few minutes and flavor before serving. 

Steamed Cranberry Dumplings. — Make the dumplings of good, pre- 
pared flour, which cannot fail to be light, using one pint of it; add a 
pinch of salt and mix with milk to a paste just stiff enough to drop by 
tablespoonfuls on the buttered steamer bottom ; steam over boiling water 
about half an hour. Serve immediately; first carefully split the fluffy 
rolls open, lightly butter and put between a tablespoonful of stewed cran- 
berry sauce (warm) ; pour over a foamy sauce made as follows : Three 
tablespoonfuls of milk, stirred into one beaten egg, a half cupful of sugar 
End one teaspoonful of flour; beat hard and put into double boiler; pour 
on slowly a cup of boiling water, stir constantly until the sauce thickens, 
then add one teaspoonful of butter and one of strawberry flavoring. 

Cranberry Pot-pie. — Butter a porcelain stewpan or kettle; put in a 
pint of berries, sprinkled with one cupful sugar; make a pint of biscuit 
dough, shape into a large ring and lay on the fruit in the kettle; then 
pour another pint of berries into and around the cup of dough, adding 
another cupful of sugar; pour one pint of boiling water into the center, 
cover closely and stew steadily for 20 minutes. When done turn from 
the kettle on to a platter; serve with cream and sugar. 

Cranberry Pudding. — Sift and measure one pint of flour; add two 
teaspoonfuls baking powder and half a teaspoonful of salt. Sift again 
until all are thoroughly blended. Add enough sweet milk to make a 
soft batter. Stir in one cup of cranberries that have been coarsely 
chopped. Pour into a pudding bag or a porcelain-lined mold. If the bag 
is used boil one and one-half hour in plenty of water. If the mold is used, 
steam the pudding two hours. 

Baked Cranberry Pudding. — Put a layer of coarsely crumbled bread in 
bottom of buttered dish; then a layer of seeded raisins and stewed cran- 
berries, a few bits of butter, and a few drops of vanilla extract; repeat 



58 THB RURAL COOK BOOK. 

bread, butter, vanilla and fruit until dish is full; have crumbs and but- 
ter top layer; bake until puffy and brown; then decorate with meringue 
and place in very moderate oven to set the latter, but not brown. 

Cream Curds. — Beat four eggs and stir them into a quart of milk 
slightly warmed. New milk was originally called for. Add a little salt 
and turn the mixture into a covered earthen pot. A bean pot or cas- 
serole will answer. Set the pot in a pan of warm water over the fire. 
As soon as the milk cracks turn it carefully out on a sieve covered with 
a linen cloth. When the draining is complete put the curds in a glass 
dish in large spoonfuls. 

Cup Custards. — In making cup custards, it is a pleasant change to 
put in each cup, before the custard is poured in, a tablespoonful of 
either strawberry or raspberry jam. The custard cups should be stood 
in a baking pan containing hot water while baking; every custard should 
be cooked in this way. A dale custard is made and baked in the ordi- 
nary manner; then, after baking, the top is covered with stoned dates, 
which may be filled with nuts if desired, and rolled in powdered sugar. 
The dates are covered with a meringue, which is browned in the oven, 
and the custard is then served cold. 

Peach Custard. — Slice ripe peaches in a glass dish and sugar them 
well two hours before they are to be served. Make a boiled custard by 
taking three eggs, one and one-half pints sweet milk and one tablespoon 
corn starch and one cup of sugar. Boil after thoroughly beating together 
in a double boiler till thick and smooth. Pour over peaches and serve 
while slightly warm. 

Date Puffs. — Two eggs, one cupful of sugar, one quarter of a cupful 
of butter, the same of milk, one teaspoonful of baking powder and flour 
enough to make a thin batter. Stir in one cupful of stoned dates; fill 
muffin cups half full and steam 30 minutes. Serve with a liquid sauce 
or with sweetened cream. 

Economy Pudding. — Take two cupfuls of ginger cookie crumbs 
(crumbled cookies) and one cupful sweet milk, one cupful molasses, one 
teaspoonful cinnamon, one-fourth teaspoonful cloves, one-fourth tea- 
spoonful nutmeg, three eggs well beaten, one-half teaspoonful salt, one 
cup seeded raisins, one-half teaspoonful of soda dissolved in one table- 
spoonful of water and two cupfuls of flour. Beat thoroughly, turn into 
greased pudding pan and steam three hours. Serve with hard sauce. 

Farina Pudding. — Place a double boiler with one pint of milk over 
the fire; when it boils, sprinkle in two and a half tablespoonfuls farina, 
one-quarter teaspoonful salt and two tablespoonfuls sugar. Cook 
twenty minutes, then add the beaten whites of two eggs, stir for a few 
minutes, remove from fire, pour into a mold and set aside to cool. 
Serve with orange sauce made in following manner: Stir the yolks of 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 59 

two eggs with half cupful sugar to a cream, add half cupful orange 
juice and one tablespoonful lemon juice, add last the beaten white of one 
egg and serve. Or a vanilla sauce may be served with the pudding. 

Fruit Puffs. — Fill old cups or baking cans to the depth of two inches 
with strawberries, sliced apples, or any kind of berries and cover with a 
layer of sugar. Put in each cup a small lump of butter and completely 
cover the berries with a batter made of one egg, one pint sweet milk, 
one and one-half teaspoon baking powder and flour to make rather stiffer 
than for pancakes. Bake 40 minutes in a steady oven. 

Gingerbread Pudding. — One cupful of molasses, one cupful of sugar, 
one-half cupful of melted lard or butter, salt; all kinds of spice — one- 
fourth teaspoonful of each — one cupful of buttermilk, two scant tea- 
spoonfuls of soda, one cupful of raisins or sliced apples, flour for stiff 
batter. Steam in a covered pudding dish two hours. Hot water may 
be substituted for buttermilk; then use half the quantity of soda. 
Whipped cream is better than sugar with this. 

Gooseberry Charlotte. — Stew a pint of ripe or nearly ripe gooseberries 
for 10 minutes very slowly, not to break them. Cut six or eight slices 
of stale plain cake; line the bottom of your pudding dish with them; 
put next a layer of the gooseberries sprinkled thickly with sugar; more 
cake, more berries, and so on until the dish is full. Cover closely and 
steam in a moderate oven 20 or 25 minutes. You will find the juice of 
the berries sufficient moisture. Serve hot with a good pudding sauce. 

Gooseberry Fool. — According to the original English recipe it was 
merely gooseberry sauce enriched with cream; American authorities, how- 
ever, use eggs and butter instead of cream. To make it English fashion, 
stew either green or ripe gooseberries, after topping and stemming them, 
until tender, in just enough water to prevent burning, strain through a 
sieve, sweeten and then stir in as much rich cream as taste dictates; 
pour into a glass dish, and set away in a cool place. A very delicious 
dessert is made by using this gooseberry fool as filling for charlottes, 
lining either one large mold cr small individual cups with ladies' fingers 
or small slices of sponge cake, and then filling with the gooseberry mix- 
ture, putting whipped cream on the top. The American recipe adds to 
one quart of ripe gooseberries, stewed and strained, the yolks of four 
eggs, one cupful of sugar, and one tablespoonful of butter, beaten to- 
gether until light. Pour into a glass dish, and heap on top the whites 
of the eggs, beaten with two tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar. 

Gooseberry Pudding. — Green gooseberries mixed with rhubarb make 
a nice combination for pie or puddings. Of course plenty of sugar is 
needed. For gooseberry pudding line a mold with baking powder or suet 
crust (preferably the latter), fill with gooseberries alone or mixed with 
rhubarb, sugar liberally, add a little water, and cover; steam three hours. 



60 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Graham Pudding. — Make a batter of a cupful of molasses, a cupful 
of sweet milk, a cupful of seeded and chopped raisins, two cupfuls of 
graham flour and two teaspoonfuls of soda. Steam for three hours. 
Eat with a sauce made of a tablespoonful of butter creamed with half 
a cupful of sugar and the stifily beaten white of an egg and lemon to 
flavor. 

Graham Date Pudding.- — Stone a cupful of dates and add them to a 
pint of boiling water, two tablespoonfuls of sugar and a pinch of salt. 
Set on the fire and stir in graham flour to make a moderately thick por- 
ridge. Cook thoroughly, set away to get cold. Serve with whipped cream. 

Graham Plum Pudding. — One egg, one cup molasses, one cup sweet 
milk, one teaspponful soda, one-half teaspoonful salt, two cupfuls gra- 
ham flour, one-half cupful raisins. Mix and steam three hours. Serve 
with this sauce : One tablespoonful butter, one tablespoonful sugar, one 
tablespoonful white flour, the yolk of one egg. Add hot water and let 
it boil, then white of egg and flavor. 

Grape Pudding. — Soak one-half a box of gelatine in one-half a cup 
of cold water, until soft; add one cup of boiling water, juice of one 
lemon, one cup of sugar and one pint of grape juice. Set aside to cool 
until it begins to stiffen, then fold in the stiffly beaten whites of two 
eggs. Run into a mold. When ready to serve unmold arid garnish with 
whipped cream. A bunch of grapes may be placed on the top of the 
mold. This will serve eight persons. 

Grape Pudding No. 2. — This is an old-fashioned dish which may be 
either boiled or baked. Delaware grapes are best for it. Wash, pick 
and flour well before putting into the batter. A heaping pint of picked 
grapes makes a fair-sized pudding. For the batter beat four eggs very 
light, whites and yolks separate, mix smoothly with the yolks half a 
pint of milk and one pint of flour sifted twice. Add half a cupful of 
butter beaten to a cream, and last of all the whites of eggs, stirring them 
in with long, swift strokes, all the same way. The grapes go in at the 
very last, and the bag or the pan ought to be ready before they are 
added. Boil the pudding three hours, and serve with a rich grape juice 
sauce. For a baked pudding the white of one egg may be kept out, and 
used for a meringue. Serve with the same sauce. 

Huckleberry Blanc Mange. — Heat one quart of milk in a double boiler 
(reserving one-third of a cupful with which to mix three tablespoonfuls 
of cornstarch). Add one-half cupful of .sugar and a pinch of salt. 
When the milk is spalding hot, stir in the cornstarch, and cook for five 
minutes. Pour this on the well-beaten whites of two eggs and beat 
thoroughly. When cool pour a little of it into a wetted mold, strew 
over this fresh blueberries, then another portion of the blanc mange, 
then more of the blueberries (using a pint in all), finish with the blanc

mange and set on ice to harden. When ready to serve turn out on a 
flat glass or china jelly plate and serve with either whipped or plain 
cream, slightly sweetened. 

Huckleberry Pudding. — Ingredients: One pint of New Orleans mo- 
lasses, a quart of huckleberries, a teaspoonful of baking soda, a teaspoon- 
ful each of powdered cinnamon, ginger and cloves and 1^ teacupful of 
flour. Put the molasses in a bowl, dissolve soda in a little water and 
stir in molasses; add spice, fruit and flour and pour the mixture in the 
pudding mold. Tie the lid on and set it in a pot of boiling water for 
three hours. 

Huckleberry Indian Pudding. — Mix together two quarts of warm milk, 
three-fourths cupful finely-chopped suet, two tablespoonfuls molasses, a 
half teaspoonful of soda, a teaspoonful of salt and enough Indian meal 
to make a stiff batter. Add at the last two eggs, whites and yolks 
beaten separately, and a quart of huckleberries dredged with flour. Boil 
for two and one-half hours in a buttered bag or mold, never allowing 
the water to stop boiling, and serve hot with foamy sauce. 

Hulnah Pudding. — Wash a cupful of rice and add to it a quart of 
milk, a cupful of sugar and a teaspoonful of cornstarch dissolved in a 
little cold milk. Flavor with quarter of a nutmeg grated. Bake an hour 
and a half, stirring down occasionally, but do not stir down the skin 
which forms on top; then let it brown. When done take from the oven, 
remove the brown skin and when the pudding is cool lay over the top 
preserved strawberries or cherries. Make a meringue with the whites 
of three eggs and three tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar, and heap 
over the top of the fruit. Set in the oven a moment to brown a delicate 
color. Eat with cream. 

Indian Pudding. — One pint of skim-raWk scalded. While hot stir in 
smoothly two cupfuls of Indian meal, add a little salt, a teaspoonful 
of cinnamon and half a cupful of molasses, also the same of sugar. 
Stir well. Now add a quart of cold skim-milk, and mix lightly as pos- 
sible. Bake slowly for two hours. Your finished product will be fra- 
grant, rich, golden, trembling in its sweet jellied whey. Now add the 
last touch. When you serve it, put a heaping spoonful of nice apple 
sauce flavored with nutmeg over the top, and if you like another spoon- 
ful of whipped cream over that. 

Indian Apple Pudding. — Take one-half of a cup of molasses, one quart 
of milk, one teaspoonful of salt, three scant cups of pared and sliced 
apples, to which add a quarter of a teaspoonful of ginger and cinna- 
mon. When the milk boils in the double boiler, pour it slowly on the 
meal. Cook half an hour in the boiler, stirring often. Now add the 
other ingredients; pour into a deep, well greased pudding dish and bake 
slowly. Eat with cream or maple syrup. 



62 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Boiled Indian Pudding. — One cupful of milk, one cupful of com meal, 
one egg, one tablespoonful of sugar, one tablespoonful of beef suet 
minced fine and strings removed, one-half teaspoonful each of salt and 
ground cinnamon, one-third saltspoonful of soda in the milk. (Sour milk 
may be used, in which case take one-half teaspoonful of soda.) Heat 
the milk with the soda; when boiling stir in the meal, salt and suet and 
set aside to cool. When cold beat in the spice, sugar and whipped 
eggs and stir vigorously. Boil in a well-greased brown bread mold for 
three hours. Leave plenty of room for the pudding to swell. Serve 
with hard sauce or caramel, maple sugar or molasses. The recipe may 
be doubled and divided in two molds for steaming — one to be set aside 
in a cool place and used in a week. A cupful of chopped, floured rai- 
sins, dates, or cooked dried apricots may be added. For molasses sauce, 
use one cupful of molasses, one and a half tablespoonful of butter, two 
tablespoonfiils of lemon juice, a dash each of nutmeg and cinnamon. 
Boil molasses, spices and butter five minutes, remove from fire and add 
lemon juice. Serve very hot. 

New England Indian Pudding. — Take one pint of milk, scald it and 
pour it over two heaping tablespoonfuls of Indian meal, in which a 
saltspoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful of cinnamon, one-quarter of a 
whole nutmeg grated, have been blended. Stir briskly, and when per- 
fectly smooth add one-third cup of chopped suet, one-third cup of mo- 
lasses ; when this is well mixed add one pint of cold milk. Beat well, 
turn into a greased dish, set it in another containing warm water and 
bake three hours in a moderate oven. Serve hot with hard sauce. 
This pudding will look as if it had cream and eggs in it, and it should 
be stirred gently three times during the first hour and a half. 

Old-Fashioned Indian Pudding. — One quart of milk, one quart of 
Indian meal, three eggs, three heaping tablespoonfuls of sugar, one tea- 
spoonful of salt and one-half pound of beef suet chopped into powder. 
Scald the milk and while boiling hot stir in the meal and suet with the 
salt. When cold, add the yolTcs, beaten light with the sugar, then the 
whites. Dip your bag in hot water, flour it and fill half full with the 
mixture, as it will swell very much. Boil five hours. Eat very hot, 
with butter and sugar. This pudding is even better when baked in a 
well-buttered dish for an hour and a half. Bake, covered, for an hour 
and a quarter, then brown. 

Kenilworth Pudding. — ^Two cupfuls of light chopped bread, one-half 
cupful chopped suet, taking care to free it from all strings, one-half 
cupful of molasses, one egg, one cupful raisins, seeded or the seedless, 
one cupful sweet milk, with one-half teaspoonful soda dissolved in it, 
one-half teaspoonful powdered cloves, one teaspoonful cinnamon and a 



THE RURAL COOK BOOP^. 63 

pinch of mace and salt. Mix thoroughly and boil two hours in a tin 
pudding dish. Eat with foamy sauce. 

Lemon Pudding. — Grate the rinds of two lemons and squeeze over 
them the juice to keep moist. Beat together two eggs, one and one- 
half cups sugar, two tablespoons cornstarch or flour, tablespoon butter 
and enough cold water to thoroughly moisten. Place in double boiler 
and add one and one-half pint boiling water, stirring till the mass is 
smooth and thick. Just before removing from fire add the rind and 
juice of the lemons and beat thoroughly. Cover with a meringue made 
of one white of egg and two tablespoons of sugar and then slightly 
brown in the oven. 

Maple Custard. — Scald one pint of rich milk in a double boiler and 
when hot add a tablespoonful of cornstarch mixed with one-third of a 
cupful of cold milk. Just before taking from the fire add two table- 
spoonfuls of fine-shaved maple sugar and the beaten yolks of three eggs. 
Stir until smooth, adding when cool a pinch of salt and half a tea- 
spoonful of vanilla. Use whites of the eggs with sugar for frosting. 
By including whites of eggs in the custard and omitting the cornstarch 
a delicious cup-custard can be made. 

Molasses Bread Pudding. — Stir into one quart of milk one pint of 
bread crunjbs, one cup of molasses, one cup of raisins, seeded, cinna- 
mon and nutmeg to flavor. Bake in a slow oven for three hours, stir- 
ring a little when first heated. Serve hot with cream. 

Peach Roll.— Into four cups of flour sift two teaspoons of baking 
powder, add two cups sour cream, one teaspoon . soda and a pinch of 
salt. Roll out thin and cover with canned peaches which have been 
drained from the juice. Sprinkle with sugar. Cut the dough into strips 
and roll up. Bake or steam one-half hour. If baked, pour a little 
water into the pan. Serve with the reserved juice or with cream and 
sugar. 

Peach Tapioca. — Soak one-half cupful of tapioca over night in plenty 
of cold water. Cover the bottom of a buttered pudding dish with a 
layer of canned peaches, pour over this the tapioca, which has been 
sweetened with one tablespoonful of sugar, put over this another layer 
of the peaches and bake in a moderate oven for half an hour. Beat the 
whites of two eggs until very stiff, add two tablespoonfuls of sugar, 
spread this over the peaches and return to the oven until a delicate 
brown. Add more sugar to the juice left from the canned peaches, beat 
one-half cupful of cream until light, pour gradually over it the peach 
juice, beat all together and serve with dessert. This dish is good served 
either cold or hot. 

Pear Charlotte. — Slightly moisten six slices of stale bfead with cold 
water, spread them with soft butter, put half of them jn the bottom of 



64 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

a buttered pudding dish, spread over them two cupfuls of finely chopped 
ripe pears and sprinkle with four tablespoonfuls of sugar, a grating of 
nutmeg and a tablespoonful of lemon juice. Lay over them the re- 
mainder of the bread, another two cupfuls of the chopped pears and 
nutmeg, sugar and lemon juice as before. Pour over one cupful of thin 
maple syrup, cover closely and bake in a slow oven for one hour. Serve 
hot with whipped cream or maple syrup. 

Pear Pudding. — Put one quart of canned pears into a baking dish; 
add a finger length of stick cinnamon and three cloves. If the pears 
have not been sweetened sufficiently when put up add sugar to make' 
them quite sweet, teaspoonful of butter and dredge a teaspoonful of 
flour over the top. Place the dish on the range where it will heat while 
you mix a pint of flour into a biscuit dough according to well-known 
directions; make a very soft dough; pat into shape with the hands and 
cover the pears. Bake about 35 minutes. There should be rich juice 
enough to moisten the crust. If preferred it may have plain cream 
served with it. 

> Persimmon Pudding. — One quart of persimmons mashed fine with the 
hands, and every seed removed. Add one quart of sweet milk, one egg, 
one tablespoonful of butter, one-half teaspoonful each of cinnamon, nut- 
meg and ginger, and half as much of allspice and cloves, half cupful of 
sugar. Pour into a buttered baking dish, and bake till well set, as if for 
custard. Eat hot or cold; delicious either way. 

English Plum Pudding. — ^One pound stoned raisins ; one pound of 
suet, chopped fine; Y^ pound of stale bread crumbs; one-fourth pound 
of brown sugar; grated rind of one lemon; 54 pound of flour; one 
pound cleaned currants ; J4 nutmeg, grated ; five eggs ; one cup milk ; 
one-half pound chopped candied peel. Mix all the dry ingredients ; then 
beat the eggs, add the milk to them, pour over the other materials, and 
mix well; it will require very hard stirring, as it is stiff. Put in 
greased molds holding one quart each, cover with well-floured cloth, and 
boil for six hours. Store away, and when used boil for six hours more. 

Plum Pudding. — Fill a deep baking pan to the depth of two inches 
with seeded plums, well sugared. Dot with bits of butter and put over 
the top a thick, good light biscuit crust with holes for the steam to 
escape. Bake 40 minutes and serve with the juice from canned plums 
or cream. This is good pudding when canning is going on to use up 
the surplus juice. Seeded grapes, peaches, apples or cherries may be 
used instead of plums. 

Plum Roll. — Sift together one pint of flour, one teaspoonful of bak- 
ing powder and one-half teaspoonful of salt; rub into the prepared flour 
one tablespoonful of butter and make into soft dough with milk or 
water; roll out quite thin, sprinkle with one cup of seeded chopped rai- 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 65 

sins, one-fourth of a cup of chopped citron and half a teaspoonful of 
cinnamon ; roll up and steam for 40 minutes ; serve hot, with hard sauce. 

Poor Man's Pudding. — One cupful sour milk, one cupful of mo- 
lasses, one cupful of cold water, two cupfuls Indian meal, half a cup of 
butter, one egg, one teaspoonful of soda, one teaspoonful of cinnamon, 
one saltspoonful of salt. Beat all together thoroughly. Pour into a 
greased pudding pan and bake two hours in a moderately hot oven. 

Poverty Pudding. — Chop one cup of suet very fine; stone one cup 
of raisins; add one cup of molasses to the suet; then add milk, one 
cupful ; add one-half teaspoonful of salt, three cupfuls of sifted flour 
and one teaspoonful of cinnamon; beat hard for three minutes; add 
raisins well floured and three level teaspoonfuls of baking powder; turn 
into a greased mold and boil three hours ; serve with hard sauce. 

Prune Sago. — After washing one-half pound of prunes put them to 
soak till well puffed out, then put them into a stewpan with enough cold 
water to cover them. Cook till soft; pass the fruit through a fine sieve, 
after stoning it. Mix with it some pearl sago that has been well boiled. 
There should be equal quantities of fruit pulp and sago. Heat up, but 
do not boil ; if too stiff thin with a little milk or water, season with 
lemon juice; it will be sweet enough for ordinary palat'es. Pour into a 
jelly mold and when cold turn on a glass dish. Serve with whipped 
cream or boiled custard. 

Pumpkin Custard. — One quart of hot milk, a large cup of strained 
squash or pumpkin, a teaspoonful of butter and one of salt, a cupful of 
sugar in which half a teaspoonful of cinnamon and a pinch of ginger 
have been mixed, and three eggs beaten light. Mix pumpkin and milk, 
add other ingredients, the eggs last, pour into custard cups which must 
be set in a pan of hot water. Bake until firm, about half an hour, testing 
with a knife blade. If it comes out clean they are done. Serve ice-cold. 

Queen's Pudding. — Take about a quart of good, rich, sweet milk, and 
half a pint of bread crumbs, minus the crust. Milk and bread are scalded 
together, and cooled enough to work through the colander. In this 
way the bread is worked smooth, and is thoroughly mixed with the milk. 
To this mixture are added the yolks of four eggs and the whites of two, 
about two-thirds of a cup of sugar, and one spoonful of butter. Beat 
the ingredients together very thoroughly, for the success of the pudding 
depends much on the beating. Ravor with nutmeg. Bake it in a very 
moderately hot oven, like a custard pie, which should never come to a 
boil. When baked, beat the whites of two eggs to a stiff froth and add 
three or four spoonfuls of granulated sugar for the frosting. Spread a 
good layer of jelly upon the pudding, and over this spread the frosting, 
and set in the oven till it browns, which takes but a very few minutes 
if the oven is hot. To be eaten with cream and sugar. 



66 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Raisin Steamed Pudding. — Blend a piece of butter the size of an egg 
with one cupful of sugar, to this add one beaten egg, half a cupful of 
milk, two teaspoonfuls of baking powder, sifted with two cupfuls of 
flour, and one cupful of seeded raisins dredged in flour. Fill cups par- 
tially full with the batter and steam three-quarters of an hour. Serve 
either with boiled sauce or sweetened cream. 

Baked Raspberry Pudding. — Line a small pudding dish with rich puff 
paste and prick with a fork. Bake a light brown and set it aside until 
cold. * Beat very light the whites of four eggs, add slowly one cup of 
sugar, and lastly stir in a quart of red raspberries. Heap this lightly into 
the cooked shell in the pudding dish, return to the oven and bake 15 
to SO minutes. Have the oven just moderately hpt. 

Boiled Raspberry Pudding. — Open a can of canned or preserved rasp- 
berries and drain off the liquor, saving it for sauce for the pudding. 
Make a rich biscuit dough; roll this into a sheet a half inch thick, 
spread thickly with the berries, sprinkle bits of butter over these and 
roll up the sheet of dough as you would a sheet of music. Put into a 
floured cloth and boil for three hours. Add to the raspberry liquor a 
little sugar and boil up once. Take the pudding from the cloth, lay on 
a dish and pour the steaming sauce over it. 

Red Pudding. — A pint of red currants, a pint of raspberries, and a 
pint of cold water; mix, and add sugar to taste. Thus, if a rather sour 
pudding is desired, two teacupfuls of sugar will be sufficient to sweeten 
these jngredients, but if, on the other hand, it is a sweeter pudding that 
is required, the amount of sugar must be increased correspondingly. To 
this mixture add cinnamon — two sticks, each about three inches in length 
will be sufficient — already broken into bits, and when all these ingre- 
dients have boiled together for half an hour in a porcelain-lined stew- 
pan, press the juice through a sieve into another receptacle, and, adding 
a teacupful of blanched almonds and citron that have been chopped finely 
together, cook again for another 20 minutes. When nearly done, thicken 
with cornstarch. Set aside in a wet mold until it has had time to be- 
come hard; then serve it in slices covered thickly with rich cream. 

Rice Pudding. — Have one pint of rice boiled done and still hot. Into 
this stir one cup of raisins to swell and begin cooking in the hot mass. 
When nearly cold beat together three eggs, one quart of milk, one cup 
sugar and vanilla to taste. Add the rice and raisins, stirring till smooth 
and free from lumps. This pudding will have a delicious thick custard 
on top of the layer of rice if properly made and is better than the old 
style of nearly solid pudding. Bake one hour and serve with sweet milk 

Lemon Rice Pudding. — Boil a cup of well washed rice in a quart of 
milk until very soft. Add to ii while hot the beaten yolks of three eggs, 
the juice and grated rind of two lemons, eight tablespoonfuls of sugar 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 67 

and a pinch of salt. If too thick, add a little milk. It should be rather 
thicker than boiled custard. Ttirn it into a pudding cHsh, beat the 
whites of the eggs very stifl with six tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar, 
spread over the top and brown delicately in a slow oven. 

Rhubarb Cobbler. — Fill a deep, buttered, earthenware pie dish with 
rhubarb cut into pieces an inch long. Make a batter of eggs, flour, milk 
and salt, allowing a large tablespoonful of flour to each egg and milk 
enough to make a batter thick as for fritter batter. Pour this over the 
rhubarb and bake until the pudding is light and nicely browned. 

Rhubarb Puffs. — One cupful of finely chopped rhubarb, one cupful 
of sugar, two tablespoonfuls of butter creamed with the sugar, add two 
well-beaten eggs, one-quarter of a cup of milk, flour with one teaspoonful 
of baking powder well mixed into it, to make a thick batter. Fill well- 
greased cups half full and steam for half an hour. The sauce to serve ■ 
with these puffs is made by creaming together one-half cupful of pow- 
dered sugar and a small half cupful of butter, then add by degrees one 
whipped egg, beating until perfectly smooth. The last thing before , serv- 
ing stir in three tablespoonfuls of boiling water. 

Boiled Rhubarb Pudding. — Make three cups of flour into dough as 
for baking powder biscuit. Roll one-fourth inch thick; cover with rhu- 
barb that has been cut in inch pieces and scalded. Wipe dry before 
spreading on the crust. Sprinkle liberally with sugar and add a dash 
of nutmeg if desired. Make a roll of the dough and cook in steamer, 
or tie up in floured cloth and drop in boiling water. Cook 30 to 45 
minutes; serve with foamy sauce. 

Rhubarb Bread Pudding. — Peel the rhubarb and cut it into small 
pieces. Cover the bottom of a pudding dish with pieces of buttered 
bread. Over this put a layer of rhubarb. Pour over it a half-teaspoon- 
ful of lemon juice, and cover liberally with sugar. Add another layer of 
bread and butter, rhubarb, lemon and sugar. Repeat 'until the dish is 
full, covering the last layer of rhubarb with well-buttered bread crumbs. 
Cover the dish, and steam for one hour. Then remove the lid and bake 
it slowly until it is nicely browned. 

Rhubarb Tapioca. — Prepare the rhubarb as for stewing; place in a 
deep baking dish' and add sugar enough to sweeten well, a little shredded 
orange peel, salt and dot with bits of butter. Add one quart of water 
to half a cupful of fine tapioca. Add a pinch of salt and cook in a 
double boiler for 15 minutes. Then pour over the rhubarb, cover the 
dish' and bake half an hour. Serve with sweetened whipped cream. 

Sour Milk Pudding. — Soak four slices of stale bread in a little milk 
or water until soft. Then stir in a quart of rich, sour milk, a cupful 
of molasses, a tablespoonful of melted butter, a teaspoonful each of 
cloves and cinnamon, saltspoonful of salt. Bake slowly three hours. 



68 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Steamed Pudding. — One cupful molasses, one egg, one cupful hot 
water, one teaspoonful saleratus, one tablespoonful butter, one cupful 
raisins, stoned, a little salt, flour enough to make stiff as cake, steam 
two hours. With this pudding use the following sauce which is de- 
licious : Cream until very light one cupful of brown sugar, and nearly 
one-half cupful butter, a little salt, and one-fourth teaspoonful of va- 
nilla. Just before serving beat in the unbeaten white of one egg. 

Strawberry Dumplings. — They will require one egg, a cup of sweet 
milk, a tablespoonful of melted butter, a heaping teaspoonful of baking 
powder, and flour enough to make a batter that will be a trifle thicker 
than that which is commonly used for griddle cakes. Pour a little of 
this batter into buttered tins, or porcelain cups; place a number of well- 
sweetened berries in the center and cover them with more batter; then 
'steam for about half an hour. Serve with a sauce made by mashing 
some strawberries and incorporating them into an ordinary hard butter- 
and-sugar sauce. 

Strawberry Pudding. — One cup cleaned strawberries, place in an 
earthen bowl, set in steamer over a pot of cold water, place over the fire; 
while- this is heating and coming to a boil make a batter of the follow- 
ing: One heaping cup of flour with two heaping teaspoonfuls of baking 
powder and one-half teaspoonful of salt; sift all together two or three 
times, then add sweet milk or water to make a soft batter that will drop 
easily from spoon. Lift the IJd of steamer and drop quickly over the 
strawberries, covering them all over rficely. Steam for 40 minutes ; do 
not let the water stop boiling. This quantity makes enough pudding 
for four persons. Eat either with cream and sugar or a sauce made as 
follows : Break one egg in a dish, add one heaping tablespoonful of 
granulated sugar, beat light, then add dessertspoonful of flour and a 
pinch of salt; beat well again; then add slowly boiling water until the 
sauce is of the required thickness (about like nice creani) ; flavor to 
taste.' This sauce is very nice with any kind of pudding, especially cot- 
tage pudding. 

Sweet Potato Pudding. — ^One quart grated raw sweet potato, one 
quart milk, three eggs, two cupfuls sugar, piece of butter the size of an 
e.gg, one-half teaspoonful of salt, cinnamon and allspice to taste. Mix 
well, put in a buttered earthen pudding dish, and bake two hours in a 
moderate oven. 

Steamed Sweet Potato Pudding. — Take two cupfuls of grated raw 
potatoes, one cupful of grated carrots, two cupfuls of currants, one 
cupful of raisins stoned and chopped, one cupful of minced suet, one cup- 
ful of sugar, one teaspoonful each of salt and soda, and flour enough 
to make a stiff batter. Place in a greased mold and steam two hours. 
Serve with boiled sauce. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 69 

Suet Pudding. — One cupful molasses, one cupful beef suet chopped 
fine, one cupful sour milk, one teaspoonful saleratus, one cupful stoned 
raisins, one-half teaspoonful salt, four cupfuls flour. Mix thoroughly. 
Put in a buttered basin in the steamer over a kettle of boiling water. 
Steam for four hours. Do not disturb while steaming; at least not for 
the first hour. 

French Tapioca Pudding. — Scald one pint of milk over hot water. 
Stir in one-third of a cup of a quick cooking tapioca, mixed with a 
few grains of salt and one-fourth a cup of sugar. Stir and cook about 
ten minutes, then add very gradually to three eggs (or two whole eggs 
and the whites of two more), beaten very light and thick. Also add a 
grating of lemon rind and a tablespoonful of butter. Turn into a tur- 
ban-shaped mold, thoroughly buttered and dusted with sugar, and bake, 
standing in a pan of water, one hour. Serve cold, turned from the 
mold and surrounded with a fruit sauce. This is a rich, yet delicate 
pudding. 

Taylor Pudding. — Stir into a cup of sweet milk a level teaspoonful 
of soda and a teaspoonful of salt. Beat into the milk a cup of Porto 
Rican molasses and stir the wet ingredients slowly into two cups of well- 
sifted flour. Beat the batter well and pour it into a greased cake tin. 
It will be about the consistency of cake batter. Bake it in a hot oven 
for about thirty or forty minutes. When it is nearly done prepare a 
liquid sauce, as follows : Put in a saucepan five tablespoonfuls of sugar 
and 10 tablespoonfuls of water. Let it boil for four minutes and then 
add three level tablespoonfuls of butter and flavor well with nutmeg. 
When the pudding is done turn it out on a platter and carry it to the 
table. Serve it cut in thick slices with the liquid sauce. 

Yorkshire Pudding. — This is a batter pudding cooked where it will 
receive the drippings from the roasting meat, and it is very good; as 
originally made it was cooked in front of an open fire, where it would 
receive drippings from the meat cooking upon a spit. About an hour 
before the roast of beef is done drain off the gravy, leaving about two 
tablespoonfuls in the dripping pan. The meat should be laid upon a rack 
over the pan, so as to raise it up. The pudding requires three eggs, one 
pint of milk, six large tablespoonfuls of flour, one-half teaspoonful of 
salt, and two dashes of pepper. Beat the eggs until light, then add the 
milk. Put the flour into a bowl, moisten it gradually with the eggs and 
milk, beat until smooth ; strain it through a sieve to avoid lumps, add the 
pepper and salt, pour it into the dripping pan and bake. Cut into squares 
or strips, and serve around the meat. 



CHAPTER Vr. 

APPLES. 

Apple ! Apple ! Call for Apple ! 

Everywhere you go ! 
Closely watcli the hill of fare, 
And If apple Is not there, 
Then proceed at once to pare, 
Cook and landlord down with care. 

Since apples play a large part in farmhouse economy, it has been 
thought well to group recipes for their use together, rather than sepa- 
rating them in various chapters. A few other apple recipes will he 
found, however, included among jellies and preserves, cakes and pastry. 

Baked Apples. — Pare and core cooking apples; put in a granite pan; 
put over them a cupful of sugar, butter the size of a walnut; cover; bake 
until almost done; take the cover off and let them brown. When apples 
are baked in a covered earthen dish or casserole flavor and appearance 
are at their best. Pare and core the apples, sprinkle them with sugar 
and a little powdered cloves and cinnamon. Add a little water, cover the 
dish, and bake a long time in a slow oven. The apples cook to a deep 
red, and are very tender and rich in flavor. Honey is a desirable addi- 
tion to baked apples. Wipe or peel the apples, and remove the core 
without running the knife clear through. Into this hollow put a bit of 
butter and a teaspoon ful of honey, and bake after the ordinary manner. 

Baked Apples in Jelly. — Peel, core and quarter a quart of apples, add 
half a cupful of water and three-fourths cupful of sugar, put in a cov- 
ered earthen dish and cook three to four hours in a slow oven, when 
they should be dark red in color. Then mix with the apples a cupful 
of liquid lemon jelly, and set in a mold to harden. These baked apples 
are also very nice eaten warm without the jelly. 

Fancy Baked Apples. — Peel and core medium-sized tart apples. Put 
them in a baking dish and pour half a cup of water over them. Set in 
a hot oven, and when the apples are heated, sprinkle with enough sugar 
to coat each and bake until tender. Make a syrup of one cup of water, 
half a cup of sugar, the juice of half a lemon, and a teaspoonful of the 
grated rind. Add two tablespoonfuls of chopped raisins, two of chopped 
candied cherries, two of chopped candied pineapple, and two of chopped 
almonds, and when the sugar is dissolved set at the back of the stove and 
let cook slowly for half an hour. When the apples are done put in little 
glass saucers, taking care not to break them. Fill with the cooked 
sweets and pour the syrup over them. Serve cold with whipped cream. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 71 

Boiled Apples in Syrup. — Rub the apples clean, but do not peel, and 
stick four cloves into each. Put in earthen' dish, half cover with cold 
water, and add one cup of sugar to each pint of water. Place upon 
stove and cook until apple skins crack; remove apples, then boil down 
syrup until it is like jelly, and pour over the fruit. 

Apple Butter. — Apple butter should be made from new cider, fresh 
from the press, and not yet fermented. Fill a porcelain-lined kettle with 
cider and boil until reduced one-half. Then boil another kettleful in 
the same way, and so continue until you have sufficient quantity. To 
every four gallons of boiled cider allow a half-bushel of nice juicy 
apples, pared, cored and quartered. The cider should be boiled the day 
before you make the apple butter. Fill a very large kettle with the 
boiled cider and add as many apples as can be kept moist. Stir fre- 
quently, and when the apples are soft beat with a wooden stick until they 
are reduced to a pulp. Cook and stir continuously until the consistency 
is that of soft marmalade and the color is a very dark brown. Have 
boiled cider at hand in case it becomes too thick, and apples if too thin. 
Twenty minutes before you take it from the fire add ground cinnamon, 
and nutmeg to taste. It requires no sugar. When cold, put into stone 
jars and cover closely. 

Apple Dumplings. — Pare, quarter and core tart apples. Put one table- 
spoonful of baking powder in one quart of flour, add one cupful of lard 
and half a teaspoonful of salt and mix with sweet milk, make stiffer than 
for biscuits, roll and cut in squares and put around the pieces of apple. 
Into a deep pudding dish put one quart of water, one cupful of sugar 
and a small lump of butter. Set it on top of the stove and let it come 
to a boil. Then put in the dumplings and bake in a brisk oven one hour. 

Apple Dumplings with Bread Dough. — Take out about a pint of bread 
dough in the morning when it is ready to go in the baking pans, more 
or less according to the size of the family; add shortening half the size 
of an egg, mix through the dough ' and set aside until an hour and a 
half before dinner. Then cut the dough into as many pieces as there are 
persons to serve and roll out. Pare and core good, tart apples, set one 
on each sheet of dough, putting a teaspoShful of sugar and a small lump 
of butter in the place of the core, fold the dough about the apple, pinch- 
ing it tightly together, set them in a deep earthen dish and let rise half 
an hour; then sprinkle a tablespoonful of sugar over them and pour on 
one cupful of cold water and bake half an hour in a hot oven. It may 
be well to cover them with a greased paper to keep them from getting 
too -brown or crusty. Eat warm with cream and sugar or any sauce 
preferred. Also excellent steamed. 

Boiled Apple Dumplings. — Pare eight fine apples and cut them in 
quarters, remove the cores. Roll the suet crust out half an inch thick and 



72 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

cut into round pieces. Dust each piece of apple with a little sugar and 
cinnamon and place four sections on each round of paste. Gather up 
the edges and pinch them together over the apple. When all the dump- 
lings are made, drop them into a kettle of boiling water and let them 
boil gently for an hour. Take them up on a hot dish and serve with 
plain, sweetened cream. If you want to serve the dumplings "just as 
grandmother did," sweeten the cream with "treacle." 

Kenilworth Ranch Dumplings.— Take a quart of flour, one cup of 
good lard and half-cup of butter ; rub this into the flour after it is sifted 
with one teaspoonful of baking powder; add enough milk to make a 
soft dough. This is rolled out quickly into a sheet an inch thick and 
then cut in squares. Into each square is laid a half apple, peeled and 
cored, and the crust tucked around it. Have ready in a dripping pan 
a syrup made of one cupful of sugar to one of water ; lay the dumplings 
in; bake in quick oven 30 to 40 minutes. Serve with an old-fashioned 
molasses sauce. 

Farmhouse Apples. — Peel and core tart apples, fill the space from 
which the cores were taken with seeded raisins, bits of shredded citron, 
sugar and a little lemon peel; stand them in a baking pan, pour over 
them half a cup of water and dust with about two tablespoonfuls of 
granulated sugar. Bake in a slow oven until perfectly tender, then 
sprinkle bread crumbs over the top; dust again with sugar, and leave 
them in the oven for 10 minutes. While they are baking mix a table- 
spoonful of flour with a half cup sugar; pour over half a pint of boiling 
water, and boil a moment; take from the fire, and pour slowly over one 
well-beaten egg; add the juice of half a lemon. Pour over the apples 
and serve warm. 

Apple Fool. — Peel, core and quarter six large apples, cook them until 
tender with three or four cloves, a small piece of lemon peel, half a 
cupful of sugar and a teacupful of water. Remove the cloves and lemon 
peel, beat well with a fork and stir in one-fourth pint of thick, sweet 
cream. Cut any kind of delicate cake into rather thin slices and place a 
layer in the bottom of a glass dish. Pour over it diluted red currant 
jelly, then cover with a thick layer of the apple fool, then another layer 
of cake and currant jelly, and heap the remainder of the apple fool over 
the top. With each helping serve a large spoonful of whipped cream 
flavored with almond. 

Hidden Apples. — Butter a deep tin pan, cover the bottom with a layer 
of pared and quartered apples. In another dish beat an egg well, put in 
enough sugar to sweeten the apples, add a little water, thicken with 
powdered bread crumbs, flavor highly with lemon. Pour this mixture 
over apples and bake until the apples are done, which will take about 
20 minutes in a hot oven. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 73 

Apple Johnny Cake. — Mix two cupfuls of cornmeal, a saltspoonful of 
salt, a teaspoonful of cream of tartar, a scant half-cupful of sugar, half 
a teaspoonful of soda dissolved in a little warm water and milk to make 
a thin batter. Stir in three sour apples that have been peeled and cut 
into thin slices. Bake in a shallow tin in a moderate oven for 35 minutes. 
Apple Kisses. — Select six small, smooth apples. Pare, cut in half and 
remove the core. Mix one-half a cupful of sugar with one-third cupful 
of butter. Place this mixture between the halves of the apples. Place 
in a baking dish with a little water and a teaspoonful of vanilla extract. 
Bake till apples are soft. Serve with their own juice for sauce. 

Apple Pancakes.— ^Measure two cupfuls of sifted flour; add half a 
teaspoonful of salt and sift again. Then stir in gradually two cupfuls of 
cold water and the beaten yolks of three or four eggs, making a per- 
fectly smooth batter. When well mixed, fold in the whites of the eggs 
beaten to a froth. Place a tablespoonful of fat in an iron frying pan 
and when hot pour in enough batter to cover the bottom of the pan 
quarter of an inch thick; have a few nicely-flavored apples, pared, cored 
and finely minced; sprinkle a layer of the apple over the cake (not too 
much, or the pancake is liable to break). As the cake cooks, slip a 
flexible knife under it, lifting it so it will not burn, and shake the pan 
gently to and fro. When the pancake is a light brown on under side, 
slip it on to a hot plate, put a piece of butter on top of the apples, hold 
the frying pan over it and deftly turn the cake back into the pan and 
cover and cook until the apples are soft. Then slip it out of pan on to a 
hot plate; set the plate over hot water to keep the cake warm and con- 
tinue frying up remainder of the batter in same manner. Serve them 
separately or piled, one upon the other. Serve with sugar sprinkled over 
them and oranges or lemons cut in halves for squeezing over thein. This 
quantity of batter should make four cakes. Do not have your pan too 
large. 

Apple Custard Pancakes. — Beat four eggs light, adding to them a half 
pint of cream and a little ground cinnamon. Peel and core the apples, 
cut them in thin slices and fry them tender in a little butter. When 
browned slightly, turn them over, pour in the custard and fry to a lig,ht 
brown. Turn out on a hot flat dish and sprinkle powdered sugar over 
the pancake. 

Apple Pie. — As a variation from the ordinary pie with two crusts, 
slice apples into a deep earthen pie dish, sweeten and flavor to taste, and 
cover with a top crust only. The absence of a soggy bottom crust is 
usually viewed as an advantage. 

Apple Custard Pie. — Peel and cut apples very' fine. Line a deep pan 
with crust, put in the apples; scatter over them small pieces of butter 
and a covering of granulated sugar. Then pour over all a cupful of 



74 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

sweet cream and bake until the apples are cooked. Serve just before it 
is quite cold. 

Dutch Apple Pie. — Make a rich puff paste and line deep pie plate. 
Core and cut into eighths as many rich tart apples as will fill the pie 
plate by laying each piece of apple with the curved side up, just as close 
together as can be placed; over the top sprinkle half cup light brown 
sugar, half teaspoonful cinnamon and tablespoonful flour. Dot bits of 
butter over the top and add half cup water; bake slowly and carefully 
until apples are tender and water absorbed. Serve waisn with cheese. 

Dried Apple Pie. — Cook a large handful of dried apples quickly in a 
tightly-covered granite basin in a little less than a quart of water. Six 
halves of dried apricots are cut fine and cooked in very little water. Fill 
,in the apple, then the apricot, together with water they were cooked in; 
add a small cupful of sugar, and nutmeg, making the pie with two crusts, 
and bake quickly. 

Apple Pot-pie. — Serve this with maple-sugar sauce. Half fill a deep 
dish with sour apples which have been quartered, pared and cored. Pour 
•over them a little boiling water and place in a hot oven until tender. 
Make a crust as for baking powder biscuit, roll out an inch thick; lay 
it over the apples and return to the oven for about 40 minutes or until 
the crust is. done. For the sauce cook together two tablespoonfuls of 
butter and one teaspoonful of flour, add half a cupful of maple syrup 
and a tiny pinch of mace, and cook until clear and smooth. 

Apple Pudding. — Make a dough as for baking powder biscuit; roll out 
one-quarter inch thick. Peel and slice good tart apples rather thin; put 
them in the middle of the dough, put on them half a cupful of sugar, 
tablespoonful of butter, and nutmeg. Wet the edges, lap over the apples 
well to Tceep the juice in, put over the apples a little water, put pudding 
in a cheesecloth bag, and boil two hours steady. Eat with good cream. 

Baked Apple Pudding. — Butter a granite or enameled pie tin and fill 
it with pared and quartered Duchess apples, cut in rather thick slices. 
Cover with a thick batter made from a cup of flour, in which a teaspoon- 
ful of baking powder, a saltspoon of salt and a tablespoon of butter 
have been well mixed. Add two-thirds of a cup of sweet milk, or sour 
milk in which a quarter of a teaspoon of soda has been dissolved; we 
prefer the sour milk. Only about half as much baking powder is 
required with the sour milk as when sweet milk is used, but we always 
use some and find that it makes the food lighter and better than where 
soda alone is used. When the pudding is done reverse it on a plate, 
spread with butter and sprinkle over it a half cup of sugar, add a few 
gratings of nutmeg. Eat with cream. 

Canadian Pudding. — One quart of quartered sour apples, one-half cup- 
ful ot sugar, one-fourth cupful of water, a pinch of grated nutmeg. Bake 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 75 

these ingredients together 30 minutes in a deep pudding dish ; then remove 
and pour over the apples the following batter: One cupful of flour, one 
tablespoonful sugar, one-fourth teaspoonful salt, one beaten egg, two 
tablespoonfuls of soft butter. Return to the oven, increase the heat and 
bake for 20 minutes more. Serve with maple sauce made as follows : 
Add to one thoroughly-beaten egg one cupful of grated maple sugar, one 
cupful of whipped cream, one-half teaspoonful of vanilla. In Vermont, 
where this recipe was obtained, a bowl of grated maple sugar invariably 
accompanied most desserts. Pudding sauces were always well covered 
with it. 

Caramel Pudding. — Peel, core and slice enough sour apples to measure 
one pint. Cook them slowly in a saucepan in two tablespoonfuls of 
butter until soft; then add one cupful of sugar, one-quarter of a tea- 
spoonful of cinnamon, two tablespoonfuls of caramel and simmer for 
twenty minutes. Mix together one and one-half cupfuls of stale bread 
crumbs, one-half cupful of crumbled stale macaroons and one-half cupful 
of seedless raisins. Butter a deep dish and fill with alternate layers of 
the apples and bread mixture, having crumbs on top. Bake three-quarters 
of an hour in a rather hot oven, and serve cold with whipped cream. 

Eureka Pudding. — Put one or two quarts of boiling water in stewpan, 
add cornmeal to make a thick gruel, and teaspoonful of salt. Let it boil 
long and slowly. While cooking peel and slice five or six (more or less) 
good cooking apples ; add to gruel. Let boil tender, add sugar and boil 
longer as for apple sauce. Turn into a mold and eat hot or cold with 
cream or boiled milk. This can be improved by putting the whites of 
eggs beaten stiff into pudding before taken from the fire; add the yolks 
to the boiled milk and serve with the pudding. 

German Pudding. — Pare, core and slice eight or 10 sour apples and 
put in a deep pudding dish, sweetening with one cupful of sugar, and 
sprinkling with a little lemon juice. Pour over them a rich egg batter, 
bake in a moderate oven one hour, and serve cold. 

Indian Apple Pudding. — Take one-half of a cup of molasses, one quart 
of milk, one teaspoonful of salt, three scant cups of pared and sliced 
apples, to which add a quarter of a teaspoonful of ginger and cinnamon. 
When the milk boils in the double boiler, pour it slowly on the meal. 
Cook half an hour in the boiler, stirring often. Now fidd the other 
ingredients; pour into a deep, well-greased pudding dish and bake slowly. 
Eat with cream or maple syrup. 

Queen Apple Pudding. — Make a rich pie crust, and roll out in an 
oblong sheet. Spread with chopped apples, cinnamon, sugar and butter 
(cream the sugar and butter together for convenience in spreading), roll 
up like a jelly cake, and cut off in two-inch lengths. Stand the slices in 
a dripping pan, with 3 little water arQund them, and bake thoroughly for 



76 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

30 minutes. Very good either hot or cold. If desired it may be baked 
in the entire roll, instead of slices. 

Apple Roly-Poly. — Mix a half cupful of finely-chopped suet, one egg, 
one teaspoonful of baking powder, three-quarters of a cupful of cold 
water and a quarter of a teaspoonful of salt, with flour enough to make 
a stiff paste. Roll out the paste in a sheet about three-quarters of an 
rnch thick, brush it over with the yolk of the egg and sprinkle with 
one tablespoonful of fine bread crumbs. Spread over it three apples 
peeled and sliced thin. Sprinkle with one-half tablespoonful of sugar 
and roll the paste. Brush the roll with egg, sprinkle it with bread crumbs 
and roll it in a napkin that has been wrung out of hot water and that 
has been covered on one side with flour. Lap the ends over securely, tie 
with a string and boil in water that has been slightly salted for an hour 
and a half. Serve with lemon sauce. 

Sour Apple Pudding. — Peel and slice several sour cooking apples into 
a pudding dish; add sugar and water as for stewing. Cover and bake 
until nearly tender. Sift together two cupfuls of flour, three tablespoon- 
fuls of baking powder, and a scant half teaspoonful of salt. Beat one 
egg, mix in half a cup of sugar, two tablespoonfuls of melted butter and 
one cupful of milk, then stir the latter into the dry ingredients. Pour the 
batter over the partly cooked apples, and bake about 30 minutes. Serve 
with whipped cream or a creamy sauce made with sugar, white of egg, 
and lump of butter. 

Apple Souffle. — Stew the apples as if for sauce, adding a little lemon 
peel and juice. Spread the slewed apples high around a baking dish. 
Make a custard of the yolks of two eggs, a pint of milk, a pinch of 
cinnamon and a tablespoonful of sugar. Let the custard cool and then 
pour it into the dish with the apples. Beat the whites of the eggs and 
spread over the top, sprinkling with sugar, and set it in the oven to brown. 
The apples should be about an inch thick at the bottom and sides of 
the dish. 

Spiced Apples with Cider. — Boil together one cupful of cider, one- 
quarter cupful vinegar, one cupful brown sugar, one bay leaf, two tea- 
spoonfuls whole allspice, two dozen whole cloves, two inches stick cinna- 
mon, two blades mace. Pare and core eight large, tart apples, cut in 
quarters and add to the boiling syrup; simmer gently until tender, but 
not broken. Take out the fruit carefully, boil syrup until thick as honey, 
pour over apples and serve cold. These are delicious with roast goose, 
duck or pork or any cold meat. 

Navy Apple Shortcake, — Butter thickly an oblong granite baking dish. 
Halve and core as many good cooking apples as will fit tightly in dish; 
cover thickly with sugar (about a coffee cupful), several grates of nut- 
meg and three tablespoonfuls of boiling water; make 3, rjgh shortcake 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 77 

dough and roll and cover the apples ; bake in a quick oven half an 
hour; loosen round the edges of the crust, turn it upside down on a hot 
platter, with a heated knife cut into squares and serve at once. 

Apple Sponge. — ^Beat the yolks of three eggs with half a cupful of 
powdered sugar ; flavor with lemon ; beat for about 10 minutes ; add to 
it the beaten whites of the eggs. Peel three big tender apples ; cut them 
in thin little slices ; sift half a cupful of flour with half a teaspoonful 
baking powder and mix well with the former; put it in a buttered baking 
pan and bake in moderate oven for half an hour; spread powdered sugar 
over and serve. 

Apple Puffs. — Chop four sour apples very fine, stir into them one 
beaten egg, one-fourth cupful molasses, a cupful and a half of cornmeal, 
the same amount of sifted flour and half a teaspoonful of salt; dissolve 
half a teaspoonful of soda in warm water and add it, using enough water 
to make a thin batter. Bake in buttered cups in a quick oven. 

Royal George. — Dissolve half a teaspoonful of soda in a little warm 
water; add to a cupful of sour cream with a pinch of salt. Then add 
flour enough to make a dough stiff enough to roll out. Roll this paste 
very thin and line a deep pudding dish with it, reserving a little for the 
top. Fill the dish with tart apples, pared and quartered. Sprinkle half a 
cupful of sugar over them and dust with cinnamon. Cover with the rest 
of the paste, cut out in rings and diamonds, and bake until the apples 
are done. Eat hot with cream or sugar and butter beaten to a white 
cream. 

Scalloped Apples. — ^Pare and quarter tart apples. Put in the baking 
dish a layer of cracker crumbs, cover liberally with butter and granu- 
lated sugar. Then lay the apples with edges lapping and sprinkle chopped 
almonds over them. Then put more crumbs, butter and sugar, then 
another layer of apples, and sprinkle lightly with crumbs, butter, sugar 
and cinnamon. Bake until apples are done. Serve with rich cream. 

Red Apple Sauce. — Wash and quarter — do not pare — enough red 
apples to fill the bean pot ; sprinkle over a cupful of sugar — more or less, 
according to the size of the pot — cover and place in the oven on ironing 
day. Cook three or four hours and pour into a pretty glass dish to cool. 
The result will be a delicious surprise in the matter of rich flavor and 
dainty appearance. 

Baked Apple Sauce. — Wash and rub dry a sufficient number of Baldwin 
apples. Remove peel in long strips. Butter a beanpot and fill with the 
cored and sliced apples, packed in layers. Sprinkle each layer generously 
with sugar, and sparingly with tiny bits of butter, then cover with strips 
of peel. Repeat until the beanpot is full. Bake in a slow oven for two 
hours. Pour out, and with a fork remove the strips of peel. Serve 
heaped in sherbet glasses and topped with a spoonful of whipped cream. 



78 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Instead of the usual watery mass, you will have a rich red sauce, deli- 
cately flavored with the peel, and of about the consistency of marmalade. 

Steamed Apple Sauce. — Pare and slice the apples rather thinner than 
for sauce cooked in the usual way, dropping into cold water as you slice 
them. Drain, turn into the inner vessel of a double boiler, and fit on the 
cover. Fill the outer kettle with warm water and bring to a steady boil. 
Keep this up for half an hour after the boil begins, then lift the lid and 
beat the soft apple to a mush with a spoon. Close and cook 15 minutes 
longer. .Run through a colander or a vegetable press, sweeten to taste 
jWhile hot, and set away to cool. 

Apple Slump. — Make a thin apple sauce, sweeten and flavor with nut- 
meg; have about two quarts when done. Take pint flour, mix as for 
biscuit dough, drop the dough by small spoonfuls into the boiling sauce, 
after they have risen and got set turn over. When done take dumplings 
out in a deep dish and pour sauce over them; serve hot. 

Apple Butter Without Cider.^Procure a new 50-pound lard can, eight 
pounds light brown sugar. Peel and slice the apples. Then commence 
to fill the can, first a layer of apples, then a layer of sugar, and so on 
until the can is full. Cover tightly and let it stand 12 hours. Place on 
stove and when it begins to boil set it back on the stove until it simmers, 
or boils gently. Do not take off lid for five hours. Then remove and 
put in ground cloves and cinnamon to suit your taste. 

Suet Apple Dumplings. — One cup of chopped suet, two cups of flour, 
one teaspoonful of salt, mix with cold water into a dough; put the apples 
in as for pudding; tie in little cloths; drop into boiling water; boil one 
hour. Use any sauce, or sugar only. 



CHAPTER VII. 

BRBAD AND MUFFINS. 

Here is the recipe for making good bread, given by the great milling 
companies and used by food demonstrators : To one quart of lukewarm 
liquid — half water and half milk, or water alone — add two half-ounce . 
compressed yeast cakes, or the usual quantity of liquid yeast, and stir 
until dissolved. Add one teaspoonful of salt and three tablespoonfuls 
of sugar, and when well dissolved stir in with wooden spoon three quarts 
of well-sifted flour, or until dough is sufficiently stiff to be turned from 
the mixing bowl to the molding board in a mass. If shortening is desired 
add two tablespoonfuls lard. Knead this dough, adding if necessary 
from time to time, flour until it becomes smooth and elastic and ceases 
to stick to fingers or board. Do not make dough too stiff. Spring wheat 
flour needs a little more working than Winter wheat, and should be a 
little softer to make it rise properly. Put dough into well-greased 
earthen bowl, brush lightly with melted butter or drippings, cover with 
towel and set in warm place, about 75 degrees, for two hours, or until 
light, then knead well and return to bowl, cover as before and set for 
another hour's rising, or until light. When light, form gently into loaves 
or rolls, place in greased bread pans, brush with butter or drippings, 
cover again and let stand for one and one-half hour, then bake. When 
bread becomes stale it may be made palatable again and as good as 
new, or even better than new, by wetting the old loaf with cold water, 
putting in the pan and rebaking it in the oven 20 to 45 minutes. It will, 
if originally good, come out moist and fresh. 

Boston Brown Bread. — Two cupfuls Indian meal; one cupful whole 
wheat flour; one cupful sour milk; one-third cupful molasses; one tea- 
spoonful soda; one-half teaspoonful salt. Mix and steam three hours, 
then brown in hot oven with the lid removed from the can. There are 
tin molds made smaller at the bottom than the top, so the loaf slips out 
nicely — the lid fitting on the outside of the tin to prevent the water 
getting in the bread, but any small tin pail with tight lid will answer 
the purpose. It is better to place an iron lid or ring in the bottom of 
the kettle to prevent the mold from coming too close to the fire. Slice 
around the loaf, not perpendicularly. 

Easy Brown Bread. — For one loaf take one cup of sour milk, one cup 
of sweet milk, one teaspoon of salt, one-half cup of molasses with one 
teaspoon of soda thoroughly stirred in; add one-half cup of white flour 
and about three cups of graham flour. Mix so stiff that a little dough 



80 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

dropped from the spoon will not quickly settle. Put in a deep bread 
pan and bake in a moderately hot oven for one hour. If not stiff enough, 
the top crust may separate from the rest of the loaf. 

Entire Wheat Bread. — ^One pint milk, scalded and cooled, one table- 
spoonful sugar, one teaspoonful salt, one-half cupful yeast, about five 
or six cupfuls whole wheat flour. In the morning mix in the order 
given, and knead until smooth and elastic. Let rise till light, allow it 
to rise a little longer, and then bake a little longer, and in an oven not 
quite so hot, as for white bread. Whole-wheat bread rises more than 
white bread, because the flour contains more gluten. Sometimes we 
make a sponge with white flour, in the same proportion as for ordinary 
bread, and then thicken and knead with the entire wheat flour. 

Light Bread. — Into two quarts of wheat flour stir a teaspoonful of 
granulated sugar and a half teaspoonful of salt, and sift into a large 
bowl. Bring to the scalding-point two cups of milk; stir into this a 
generous teaspoonful of butter, and, when this melts, add two cups of 
boiling water. Remove from the fire and set aside until blood-warm, 
then stir in a gill of water of the same temperature, in which a half- 
cake of compressed yeast has been thoroughly dissolved. Make a hollow 
in the centre of the sifted flour and pour in the liquid. Stir to a soft 
dough, then turn upon a floured board and knead for 15 minutes'; set in 
a bread raiser in a warm place for six hours or until light. Make into 
three loaves of uniform size, knead each of these for at least five min- 
utes, put into a baking-pan, cover with a cloth, and set to rise until very 
light. Bake in a steady oven. 

Oatmeal Brown Bread. — Mix in a large bowl one pint of Quaker 
oats, a rounding teaspoonful of salt, a pint of Pettijohn's breakfast 
food, half a pint of whole wheat flour and half a pint of yellow gran- 
ulated cornmeal. Put into another bowl one pint of thick sour milk and 
half a pint of molasses. Dissolve a level teaspoonful of bicarbonate 
of soda in two tablespoonfuls of warm water; add this to the molasses 
and sour milk; stijr until foaming; then add it to the dry ingredients 
and mix until every grain is moistened. Turn into a greased mold and 
boil or steam continuously for four hours. Stand in a moderate oven 
for 30 minutes. It will then be ready to use. This may be toasted on 
the second day, or warmed over in the oven, or it may be used cold. 
Toasted it makes an acceptable breakfast bread. 

Scotch Oat Bread. — To two cups of steel-cut oatmeal, one teaspoon- 
ful soda and one teaspoonful salt, add two cups of boiling water; when 
cool add one cup of molasses and one cake of yeast. Stand over night. 
In the morning mix stiff with wheat flour. Shape into loaves, let rise 
and bake. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 81 

Salt-Rising Bread. — Dissolve a half teaspoonful of salt in two cups 
of scalding water, and beat in gradually enough flour to make a very 
soft dough. Beat for 10 minutes, cover and set in a very warm place 
for eight hours. Now stir a teaspoonful of salt into a pint of lukewarm 
milk and add enough flour to make a stiff batter before working it into 
the risen dough. Mix thoroughly, cover and set again in a warm place 
to rise until very light. Turn into a wooden bowl and knead in enough 
flour to make the batter of the consistency of ordinary bread dough. 
Make into loaves and set these to rise, and when light, bake. 

Sour Milk Corn Bread. — Mix together in a bowl three cupfuls of 
corn meal and one cupful of graham flour. Stir in a teaspoonful of 
salt, a tablespoonful of melted butter, and two cupfuls of sour milk. 
Now beat in three eggs, whipped light, and a small teaspoonful of soda 
dissolved in a little boiling water. Beat for five minutes, then pour into 
a greased mold with a funnel in the center. Bake for an hour, or until 
a straw comes out clear from the thickest part of the loaf. 

Spoon Corn Bread. — Put a quart of milk, or half milk and half water, 
in a double boiler. Add four large kitchen spoonfuls of white cornmeal, 
and stir and cook five minutes. Remove from the fire and let it cool, 
stirring it once or twice as it cools. Then add two or three eggs beaten 
with two tablespoonfuls of wheat flour, one tablespoonful of butter and 
a scant teaspoonful of salt. Mix well, then pour into a greased baking 
dish, and bake 35 minutes. Serve immediately in dish in which it is 
baked, with a folded napkin wrapped around the dish. 

Susan's Cornbread.— One cup white flour, one-half cup yellow corn- 
meal, one-half teaspoonful salt, one tablespoonful sugar, two teaspoon- 
fuls baking powder. Sift dry ingredients, then mix with one beaten 
egg and enough sweet milk to make a thin batter, stirring in at the 
last a piece of butter the size of a walnut melted. Pour into a well- 
greased shallow pan and bake in a quick oven. 

Crackling Bread. — One quart of cornmeal^three pints make more 
dough — a pint of buttermilk, a teaspoonful of soda, a big pinch of salt, 
a pint of brown cracklings left from making lard, warm water. Crush 
the cracklings with a rolling pin, heat them and stir in the dough, 
which must be thick enough to mold well (thin with the warm water). 
Mold the bread with the hands in small oblong pones about three inches 
thick, putting the pones as you mold them in hot, well-greased pans. 
Bake in a hot oven until brown. 

Crumb-loaf. — Beat two eggs with a pinch of salt added; add a cupful 
of sweet milk and a quarter of a cupful of sugar. Stir in enongh 
bread crumbs to make a medium thick batter, then add flour enough to 
thicken like corn bread. Sift a teaspoonful of baking powder in with 



82 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

the flour. Bake to a rich, crisp brown and serve hot. Fine for either 
breakfast or supper. 

Egg Bread. — Two eggs,- one pint of buttermilk, three pints of corn- 
meal, one-half pint of lard, one teaspoonful of soda, a pinch of salt, sweet 
milk or sweet cream. Stir the soda in the buttermilk until it boils up, 
mix the bread quickly, adding a sufficient quantity of sweet milk or 
sweet cream to make a rather thin batter; beat in the eggs, and add 
the lard, melted and hot, last. Pour quickly into frying hot. greased 
baking pans and bake quickly to a delicate brown. This bread will be a 
golden yellow and as light as cake. 

Swedish Breakfast Bread. — Add one-third cup butter, one-fourth cup 
sugar, and one-half teaspoon salt to one cup scalded milk. When luke- 
warm, add one-third yeast-cake dissolved in one-fourth cup lukewarm 
milk, one egg, well beaten, one-half cup raisins, stoned and cut in pieces, 
and flour to make a stiff batter. Cover and let rise over night; in morn- 
ing cut down and spread in buttered dripping-pan, one-half inch thick. 
Cover and let rise again. Before baking brush over with beaten egg and 
cover with the following mixture: Melt three tablespoons butter, add 
one-third cup sugar, and one teaspoon cinnamon. When sugar is par- 
tially melted, add three tablespoons flour. Bake in a moderate oven, and 
cut in squares for serving. 

Beaten Biscuits. — One quart of sifted flour, one tablespoonful of 
lard, one-half pint cold water. Put the flour and salt in a bowl, rub the 
lard in with the hands, add the water gradually. Work and knead until 
smooth and elastic. Then put the dough on a block and pound it with 
a mallet, rolling pin or ax for one hour until full of bubbles. The old- 
fashioned rule was to "hit it 500 licks." Form into small round cakes, 
stick with a fork here and there, and bake in a moderately quick oven 
about 20 minutes. They should be brown on top, white on the sides, 
and extremely white inside. 

Bread-crumb Biscuits.-j-Take one quart each of bread crumbs and 
sour milk, add one-half cupful of lard, one-half teaspoonful of salt, and 
stiffen with flour in which is put before sifting one teaspoonful each of 
saleratus aiid baking powder. Mold, and bake in a quick oven. Be 
sure to allow the crumbs to soak for an hour in the milk before adding 
the other ingredients. 

Buttermilk Biscuits. — Two coffeecupfuls (even) of flour, half a cof- 
feecupful of sour milk, half a coffeecupful of buttermilk, one teaspoonful 
of sugar, one teaspoonful of yeast powder, half a teaspoonful of salt, 
half a teaspoonful of soda. Mix sugar, yeast powder and salt with 
flour and sift; dissolve soda in two tablespoonfuls of cold water, beat 
into the sour milk until it stops "purring,'' mix quickly with dry ingre- 
dients, using a spoon, turn on a well-floured board, pat with the hand 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 83 

into a cake half an inch thick, roll, cut into biscuits ; bake in a very- 
hot oven 10 minutes. 

French Biscuits. — ^One cupful of butter, one cupful of sugar, the stif- 
fly-beaten white of one egg, one-fourth cupful of thick sour milk, half 
a teaspoonful of soda dissolved in a very little' hot water, flour enough 
to make a dough that may be rolled out. Sprinkle with sugar, cut into 
large circles, and bake for 20 minutes. 

Martha Washington Biscuits. — Sift one pint of flour with one table- 
spoonful of sugar, one teaspoonful each of baking powder and salt. Rub 
into it one tablespoonful of lard. Mix with one well-beaten egg and one 
cupful of water; roll one-fourth of an inch in thickness and cut with 
small round cutter. Fry in hot fat until cooked on on? side, turn and 
brown. 

Molded Biscuits. — One quart of flour, into which two heaping tea- 
spoonfuls of baking powder and one of salt have been sifted; rub into 
it a scant half cupful of lard and butter, half and half; stir to a dough 
with enough milk to make it just too thin to roll out. Grease mufSn 
rings and put on a greased baking pan; drop from a spoon dough enough 
nearly to fill each ring; bake in a quick oven. Delicious tea cake, to be 
eaten hot with butter, is made by adding a tablespoonful of sugar and on'e 
well-beaten egg to this recipe and baking in one loaf, or in a large flat 
cake to be split open and buttered, then cut in sections. 

Potato Biscuits.— Pare and boil six white potatoes. While hot put 
through a ncer, then add gradually one pint of scalded milk, one-half of 
a cupful of butter, one teaspoonful each of salt and sugar and one-half 
of a cupful of flour. Let stand until lukewarm, then add one yeast cake 
dissolved in a little warm water and sifted flour to make a soft dough. 
Knead lightly, using no more flour than is needed to keep from sticking 
to the board. Cover and let stand again until very light, then form 
into small rolls, handling most carefully and greasing the hands if the 
dough is inclined to stick. Place in greased pans, let stand until fully 
doubled in bulk, then bake about twenty ' minutes in a quick oven. 

Sour Cream Biscuits. — Use three good tablespoonfuls of thick sour 
cream; put this into a quart measure and fill it two-thirds full with 
sweet milk; add half a teaspoonful of salt, two teaspoonfuls of cream 
of tartar and a teaspoonful of soda. Stir into this enough flour to make 
a dough that will roll very soft; cut into small biscuits, brush well with 
melted butter, and bake about 20 minutes in a good oven. 

Tea Biscuits.— For a six o'clock tea, set the batter about one o'clock. 
Add to one quart sifted flour a teaspoonful sugar, a heaping teaspoonful 
salt, and a tablespoonful each lard and butter; rub in well; dissolve one- 
half yeast cake (compressed) in a little tepid water; add to a cupful 
sweet milk ; then mix well with the flour ; cover and set out of a draught

to rise; when light turn out on the molding board, sprinkle with a very 
little flour and roll out to the thickness of half an inch; cut out with 
two sizes of round cutters, placing the smaller ones on top of the 
larger, with a brushing of melted butter between; let stand about an 
hour to rise, then bake.- The oven does not need to be as hot as for 
baking powder biscuit. 

Sugared Biscuits. — Ordinary biscuit dough is made, rolled out as for 
cutting, and then lightly spread with butter and sugar, creamed together. 
The dough is then rolled up like a jelly roll, and cut into slices like cin- 
namon buns, each biscuit being sprinkled on top with a little more 
butter and sugar. 

Yarmouth Biscuit. — Mix three-quarters of a pound of sifted flour, 
one-half pound of sugar and one-half pound of currants to a paste with 
half a pound of butter and three eggs. Roll out to one-eighth of an 
inch in thickness and bake a light brown in quick oven. 

Brioche. — This is one of the delicate breads that delight visitors in 
France. One-half pound flour, one egg, one teaspoon sugar, two ounces 
butter, one- half teaspoon salt, one-quarter pint milk, one ounce yeast. 
Sift the flour. Heat milk lukewarm and dissolve in it the butter and 
yeast. Add the egg, well beaten, and the salt and sugar. Then stir 
in the flour, gradually working it all the time with your hand. Beat 
mixture well for 10 minutes, till the dough, almost stops sticking to 
your fingers. Cover with a cloth and set in a warm place to rise. When 
four times its original size turn it on a floured board and take pieces 
about the size of a turkey's egg and form into fancy shapes, twists, 
knots, etc. Put in a buttered tin and let rise 15 minutes. When risen, 
brush over lightly with the egg beaten up. Bake in quick oven 20 min- 
utes. 

Buckwheat Cake. — This is an old Canadian recipe and very good. 
Make batter as for buckwheat pancakes, only a trifle thicker, and bake 
in well-greased shallow pan, like com bread. There should be a delicious 
brown crust on the bottom. The prepared flour can be used. 

Breakfast Buns. — Scald one-half pint of milk; pour it over two table- 
spoonfuls of sugar; one quart of lukewarm water; when milk is luke- 
warm add the yeast and enough flour to make a "'sponge." Let rise until 
it doubles its original bulk, about two hours; then cream together half 
a cupful of butter and half a cupful of sugar; add two well-beaten 
eggs and one cupful of scalded milk. Mix this into the sponge and 
add sufficient flour to make a soft dough; knead lightly, cover and set 
to rise until very light; then mold into small buns and lay in greased 
pans, allowing plenty of room to rise; then bake in a quick oven for 15 
or 30 minutes. They must not be heavy and doughy. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 85 

Hot Cross Buns. — Beat a quarter cup of butter to a cream ; add four 
tablespoonfuls of sugar and then add gradually a pint of milk that has 
been scalded and cooled; add a yeast cake, dissolved, and sufficient flour 
to make a batter. Beat thoroughly. Stand in a warm place for about 
three hours. Then add four eggs well beaten and flour enough to make 
a soft dough. Knead carefullj'. Stand aside until very light and form 
into buns. Cut them in the center ; brush them with sugar and white of 
egg and bake in a quick oven. 

German Coffee Cake. — ^Take enough dough after it is mixed for one 
loaf and add one egg, shortening half the size of an egg and one-half 
cupful of sugar. Mix thoroughly through the dough and add flour 
enough to roll out an inch thick; let rise and wet the top of it with 
cold water, sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon, and bake. To be cut 
in slices and eaten with or without butter for breakfast with coflfee and 
put up for the children's school lunches in place of so much rich cake. 
For variety roll the dough quite thin and sprinkle it with currants well 
cleansed and dates or figs cut in small bits ; then roll up tightly and 
with a sharp knife cut into slices one-half inch thick, lay in greased 
pans, let rise and bake in moderate heat. 

Fastnachts. — Mix to a light sponge the following ingredients : Three- 
fourths quart of warm milk, one-half pound of sifted flour, four ounces 
of melted butter, one ounce of yeast, one-half cupful of sugar, one egg, 
one-half pound of warmed currants, the grated rind of a lemon, one 
teaspoonful of cinnamon. Set in a warm place to rise, when light add 
enough flour to mold into biscuits, place them on baking tins and let 
rise once more, then rub over the top with a brush dipped in a well- 
beaten egg. Bake in a hot oven. Many prefer to serve them warm 
with butter. 

Bran Gems. — Beat two eggs very light, add half a teaspoonful of salt, 
a tablespoonful of brown sugar and one and one-half cupfuls of milk, 
then stir in a pint of finely ground bran. Fill oiled gem pans half full 
and bake in a hot oven 20 minutes. These gems are advised in some 
forms of indigestion, where fine flour is objectionable. 

Corn Gems. — Sift together one pint of cornmeal, one pint of flour and 
two teaspoonfuls of baking powder. Add one-third of a pint each of 
milk and water. Mix into a firm batter and fill greased gem pans two- 
thirds full. 

Entire Wheat Gems. — Three cupfuls entire wheat flour or wheat 
meal, two cupfuls cold water, half cupful of milk. Heat gem pans very 
hot on the top of the stove, fill them even full of the batter, place on the 
grate of a very hot oven. Let them remain 10 minutes on the grate, 
then bake 30 minutes on the bottom of the oven. They are nearly as 



86 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

good if 2^ cupfuls of water and no milk is used. Do not use any salt, 
or they will not be so light. . 

Puff Gems. — Beat very light one egg, then add to it one-quarter cup- 
ful sugar, two tablespoonfuls of melted butter, one cupful of sotjr milk. 
Beat all well. Then add one cupful of cornmeal and one cupful of 
white flour into which has been well mixed one heaping teaspoonful of 
baking powder. Lastly dissolve one-quarter teaspoonful of soda in one 
tablespoonful of boiling water, add, beat well and pour in gem pans, and 
bake 20 minutes in a hot oven. 

Golden Johnny Cake. — Heat to scalding point one pint of sweet milk; 
while hot stir into it one teaspoonful butter, one teaspoonful white su- 
gar and three-fourths of a cupful of steamed squash out of which all 
water has been pressed. Sift together two cupfuls cornmeal, one cup- 
ful flour, two heaping teaspoonfuls baking powder and a scant tea- 
spoonful salt. Add to this, gradually, the milk and squash, as soon as it 
is lukewarm. Bake in one greased pan, or in gem pans if preferred. If 
it seems stiff a little more milk may be added. Bake in a quick oven. 
Meal varies so that it is hard to give the exact quantity. 

Oatmeal Gems. — Separate two eggs; beat the yolks for a moment; add 
a half pint of milk, then one and one-half cup of bread flour, and beat 
thoroughly; add a tablespoonful of melted butter, a half-teaspoonful of 
salt, one cup of left-over oatmeal porridge and one rounding teaspoonful 
of baking powder. Beat for about two minutes. Fold in carefully the 
well-beaten whites of the eggs. Pour this mixture into 12 greased gem 
pans and bake in a moderately quick oven 20 minutes. 

Popovers. — To make them without baking powder beat three eggs 
until very light, then add two cupfuls of sweet milk and one-half tea- 
spoonful of salt. Stir in four cupfuls of flour, and see that the batter 
"is very smooth ; then add one additional cupful of milk and a piece 
of butter the size of an egg, melted. Heat the pop-over irons or cups, 
and when they are very hot nearly fill with the batter. Bake in a 
quick oven for half an hour. To make pop-overs with baking powder re- 
quires one egg, well beaten, one large spoonful of melted butter, two 
tablespoonfuls of sugar, one cupful of sweet milk, 1J4 cupful of flour, 
salt, and one-fourth tea.spoonful Of baking powder. 

Popovers Without Eggs. — One cup of milk, one cup of water, no salt 
and no baking powder. The gem pans are heated, a piece of butter the 
size of a walnut being put to melt in each little pan while the batter is 
beaten up. The oven must be good, with steady heat, and the door 
must not be opened for 25 minutes after the popovers are put in, or 
they will fall. Salt will prevent them from rising, but if made accord- 
ing to directions, they will be very light, Flour enough for drop batter. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 87 

Breakfast Rolls. — Three cups of sweet milk, one cup of butter or 
lard; dissolve one yeast cake in a cup of warm water, mix with flour 
enough to make dough. Let rise over night, in the morning add one 
egg, knead thoroughly, let rise again, and when light make out in rolls. 
Place in pans, keep warm, and bake when very light. 

Buttermilk Muffins. — A quart of fresh buttermilk, one teaspoonful of 
soda, a pinch of salt and enough flour to make a stiff batter and two 
or three tablespoonfuls of sour cream. Dissolve the soda in a little 
of the buttermilk, then add to the rest; add salt and cream and the 
flour. Bake in gem pans in a hot oven. 

Bread Sponge Muffins. — Late in the evenmg set a sponge as for 
water bread, allowing a pint of warm water for a dozen muffins, a 
third of a cake of compressed yeast and a pinch of salt. Mix the bat- 
ter a little thicker than for pancakes and beat thoroughly. In the 
morning have gem pans greased, and in cold weather warm them; pour 
in the batter without stirring, filling half full; let them rise at least an 
hour and bake in a hot oven. 

Cape Cod Muffins.— rSift two cupfuls of flour with two teaspoonfuln 
of baking powder, a half-teaspoonful of salt and one rounded teaspoonful 
of sugar. Beat three eggs without separating; add to them lyi cupful 
of milk and stir the milk and eggs into the flour. Have ready a cupful 
of carefully-cleaned blueberries and stir them lightly into the mixture. 
Bake in hot buttered gem pans in a quick oven for 15 minutes. 

Cream of Wheat Muffins. — Add to two cupfuls of cooked cream of 
wheat, a cupful of milk and work it smooth, then two eggs well beaten 
and a tablespoonful of sugar; to a pint of flour add two small tea- 
spoonfuls of baking powder, and a half teaspoonful of salt, rub into the 
flour a tablespoonful lard or butter; add to these ingredients the wheat 
that has been mixed with the milk and eggs. Butter muffin pans, fill them 
two-thirds full, and bake in a hot oven 20 minutes. 

Crumb Muffins. — Scraps of stale bread, toasted in the oven until 
crisp, find many uses. We run them through the food chopper until fine 
enough for use. If these crumbs are sifted, the fine particles will be 
found very nice for muffins and griddle cakes. For muffins, use one 
egg, one tablespoonful of butter, one teaspoonful of sugar and half that 
of baking powder, two cupfuls of the crumbs and one of flour; mix 
with water or sweet milk and bake slowly in gem pans. For griddle 
cakes use two cupfuls of crumbs to one of self-raising buckwheat flour. 

English Muffins. — Dissolve half of a compressed yeast cake in six 
tablespoonfuls of lukewarm water. Have a pint of milk scalding hot 
and stir into it a heaping teaspoonful of lard. Boil until the lard is dis- 
solved, then take from the fire and, when the milk is blood warm, stir it 



88 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

gradually into a pint of flour that has been sifted with two saltspoonfuls 
of salt. When the milk is all worked in, add the dissolved yeast cake, 
and blend thoroughly. Turn the batter into a bread raiser and set to 
rise in a moderately warm room for six or eight hours, or until light. 
When light, turn the mass out upon a floured pastry board and break 
off bits of the dough, having them of uniform size, and each about as 
large as an ordinary tea biscuit. Handle very lightly, and roll each 
muffin in flour. Have a soapstone griddle thoroughly heated and lay 
these muffins upon it. Bake them without touching until they swell to 
twice their original size. When brown on the under side lift carefully 
and turn. When the other side is baked to a delicate brown, the muf- 
fins are done. When ready to use, tear them open, toast and butter 
generously. 

Parker House Rolls. — Scald one pint of milk with a piece of butter 
the size of an egg added. Put the milk into a bread pan with one table- 
spoon of sugar and one teaspoon of salt. When the milk has cooled a 
trifle, sift in sufficient flour to make a stiff batter. Now add one cake 
of yeast and beat well, then add flour to make a soft loaf and knead 
thoroughly. Let it stand over night. In the morning, little kneading is 
required. Roll out this and cut with a biscuit-cutter. Brush over with' 
melted butter, lap one-half over the other, put in a pan not too close 
together, and when very light, bake in a quick oven. 

Quick Cinnamon Rolls. — Sift together two cups of flour, two teaspoon- 
fuls of baking powder and a half teaspoonful of salt. Into this rub 
one tablespoonful of butter. Mix with milk to make a soft dough. Roll 
out to half an inch in thickness, spread with warmed butter and sprinkle 
with two tablespoonfuls of brown sugar, one teaspoonful of cinnamon 
and scatter over one-half cup of seeded raisins. Roll up as for jelly 
cake and cut into inch slices; place so as they will touch in a pan and 
bake in a quick oven. 

Scotch Scones. — Take two pounds of fine oatmeal, a tablespoonful 
of salt, a tablespoonful of lard and enough water to make a stiff dough. 
Rub the lard into the oatmeal and add the salt and water. In rolling 
the palm of the hand should be used instead of a rolling-pin. Press the 
dough into a round cake about a quarter of an inch thick, cut into seg- 
ments and cook on a griddle over a slow fire until a light brown. Oat- 
meal scones properly prepared will keep for weeks. 

Boston Tea Cakes. — Beat two eggs in a teacup, fill the cup with sweet 
milk, turn into a bowl with one cupful of sugar, 10 even teaspoonfuls of 
melted butter, 154 cupful of flour and two teaspoonfuls of baking pow- 
der. This is the most reliable, easily made and accommodating of cakes. 
Delicious baked in layers and spread with jam or cream. May be baked 
in a loaf or small patty pans. Serve warm with tea. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 89 

English Tea Cake. — Sift four cupfuls of dried flour into a bowl and 
chop into it a scant cupful of butter. Dissolve half a yeast cake in four 
tablespoonfuls of warm water and stir it into two cupfuls of milk, or 
enough to make a soft dough. Roll this out into a sheet and cut into 
cakes as large as a tea plate and less than half an inch thick. Set them, 
covered lightly, in a warm place until they have nearly trebled in thick- 
ness. Bake in a floured pan. Keep them covered for 20 minutes, then 
brown. Run a sharp knife around the edge, tear the cake open, butter 
and serve upon a plate lined and covered with a heated napkin. 

Zimmet-Kuchen. — Two cupfuls of bread sponge, one egg, half a cup- 
ful of sugar, butter the size of a walnut, one cupful of warm water. 
Mix these ingredients together and make a dough not quite as stiff as 
for bread. Let it rise well, roll out one-half inch thick, let it rise again 
until quite light. Spread the dough thinly and evenly in a long shallow 
tin. Cover with an egg beaten with a tablespoonful of sugar and 
sprinkle liberally with powdered cinnamon and granulated sugar. The 
ingredients on the kuchen will melt and run together into a delicious can- 
died top. Serve by cutting into strips one inch wide. 

Butter Cakes. — Sift two cupfuls of floor with three teaspoonfuls of 
baking powder and a half teaspoonful of salt. Rub in two tablespoonfuls 
of butter and add gradually three-fourths of a cupful of milk. Toss 
upon a well-floured board and roll out as thick as though you were 
making biscuit, then cut into rounds with a small biscuit cutter and bake 
upon a hot, well-greased griddle. Cook slowly until they puff up double 
their size, then turn and bake on the other side. Set them in a moderate 
oven for a few minutes before serving, then break them open and serve 
with butter and maple syrup. 

Waffles. — For the batter use one pint of sifted flour, one level tea- 
spoonful baking powder, one-half teaspoonful salt, one tablespoonful but- 
ter, melted, two eggs and IJ/j cupful milk ; beat to a smooth batter. Heat 
the waffle iron very hot; grease both lids; put a cooking spoonful of 
batter into each lid, and cook five minutes on each side. Slip out on to a 
hot dish. Place in the oven until more are cooked, then put them one 
on top of the other, each buttered and heaped with grated maple sugar. 



CHAPTER VIII. 

CAKEIS. 

"Breafhes there a man with, soul so dead 
He loves not new-baked ginger bread? 
Who, stepping through the kitchen door, 
On baking day sees goodly store 
Of fragrant amber-shadowed cake, 
And, half-unconscious, does not break 
A ragged chunk ! Ah, toothsome bliss ! 
He is a churl who knows not this." 

To get a fine grained cake, beat thoroughly after the flour is added. 
Sweet milk makes cake that cuts like pound cake. Sour milk makes 
spongy, light cake. Always sift flour before measuring, then it may be 
sifted again with the baking powder to insure their being thoroughly 
blended. In making fruit cakes add the fruit before putting in the flour, 
as this will prevent it falling to the bottom of the cake. Flouring the 
fruit is unnecessary, unless the fruit is damp. If a cake cracks open 
while baking, the recipe contains too much flour. In creaming butter 
and sugar, when the butter is too hard to blend easily, warm the bowl 
and if necessary warm the sugar, but never warm the butter, as this will 
change both texture and flavor of the cake. The smaller the cake the 
hotter should be the oven. Large rich cakes require very slow baking. 
Grease cake pans with lard or drippings, as butter will be likely to make 
the cake stick, owing to the salt in it. 

When eggs are short in the Winter snow may be used as a substitute ; 
one of The R. N.-Y. housewives says that one cupful of snow, 'beaten in 
after all the ingredients are put together, is equal to two eggs. 

Almond Cookies. — Cream together one-half cupful of butter and two 
cupfuls sugar. Stir in alternately a little at a time one cupful of sweet 
milk and twice sifted flour to make a dough which can be handled. With 
the. last of the flour sift in two teaspoonfuls of baking powder; roll out 
one-quarter inch thick; before cutting out sprinkle with a cup of almonds 
which have been blanched and chopped and a teaspoon of granulated 
sugar mixed through them. Bake in quick oven. These should be eaten 
fresh, as should aU cakes made without the addition of eggs. 

Angel Cake. — Four ounces and a heaping tablespoonful of flour, 12 
ounces of powdered sugar, the whites of 11 eggs beaten to a very stiff 
froth (flavor with rose before beating), a teaspoonful of cream of tartar 
and a little salt. Mix the sugar, flour, salt and cream of tartar together 
and sift through a very fine sieve six times. Then stir in lightly the 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 91 

beaten whites. Bake in a nezv pan, without greasing, for 40 minutes. 
After taking from the oven, invert the pan and place upon cups or 
tumblers until the cake is cold, then remove and cover with a thin icing. 
No soda is used. A pan with a tin tube in the center is preferable for 
baking. 

Angel Cake No. 2. — Take the whites of nine large eggs. Add to 
them a pinch of salt and whip them lightly until they are partly stiff, 
then add half a teaspoonful of cream of tartar and whip them until very 
stiff. Fold in carefully one and one-fourth cupful of granulated sugar 
that has been sifted three times. Sift one cupful of the best pastry 
flour seven times (if you want a perfect cake), and fold it into the 
sugar and whipped eggs lightly. Last of all, add a teaspoonful of 
vanilla. Turn the cake into a large, unbuttered pan. Bake in a moderate 
even from 35 to 50 minutes. Never open the oven door until you think 
the cake is done, as it falls very easily. On taking it from the oven 
turn it upside down in such a way that current of air will pass under 
it until it is cold. When cold loosen the cake from the sides of the pan 
and lift it out. It should be so delicately baked that this will not be 
difficult. If you intend to ice it cover it with a soft uncooked ' icing 
made with powdered sugar, white of egg and a very little vanilla. 
Angel cake is generally better for being kept a day before serving. If it 
is a little tough place it in a stone jar and cover with a plate. Let it 
stand for two or three days in this way and it will become tender. 

Apple Cake. — Measure two cupfuls of sifted flour, add two teaspoon- 
fuls of baking powder and half a teaspoonful of salt and sift again into 
a mixing bowl ; make a well in the center ; beat whites of two and yolk 
of one egg until light, add grated rind of a lemon, one tablespoonful of 
melted butter and a cupful of milk; mix this gradually into the flour 
until you have a thick batter or very soft dough. Spread this on shallow, 
well-buttered tins, having batter not more than half an inch thick. Pare 
and cut into eighths enough large, tart apples to cover the top of the 
cake by laying the pieces close together in rows, pressing the sharp edges 
into the dough; brush well with softened but not melted butter, sprinkle 
thickly with granulated sugar and bake in a hot oven. When done dust 
with powdered sugar and cinnamon. 

Dutch Apple Cake. — Measure a pint of sifted flour, add half a level 
teaspoonful salt, quarter of a cupful of sugar and a scant teaspoonful 
of soda. Sift three tim.es. Beat up one egg with a cupful of sour milk. 
Rub a third of a cupful of butter into the flour thoroughly; then mix 
in the liquid, making a soft dough. Spread this half an inch thick in a 
well-greased biscuit pan. Pare and core five juicy, nicely-flavored apples, 
and cut them into eighths; arrange them in parallel rows, sharp edges 
down, on top of the dough, pressing down so that they are . partially 



92 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

imbedded in the dough. Sprinkle over thickly with sugar and a little 
cinnamon and spread with bits of butter. Bake in a quick oven for 25 
minutes. Serve hot as a dessert or tea cake. Made with fresh, ripe 
peaches cut in quarters, it is delicious. Omit the cinnamon when peaches 
are used. 

Apple Kuchen. — 'One pint of flour, one teaspoonful of cream of tartar, 
one-half teaspoonful of soda, one-half teaspoonful salt, an egg, a cupful 
of milk, two tablesponfuls of butter, four large apples. Sift salt, soda 
and cream of tartar with the flour and rub in the butter. Put the 
beaten egg into the milk and mix with the flour. Spread the dough 
one-half inch thick on a buttered pan. Cut the pared apples in eighths 
and stick into the dough in rows. Sprinkle with sugar and bake 25 
minutes. 

Apple Layer Cake. — One cupful of sugar creamed with half a cupful 
of butter; add the beaten yolks of four eggs, one-half cupful of milk, 
two cupfuls of flour, with two level teaspoonfuls of baking powder sifted 
through it. One teaspoonful of lemon or almond extract and the beaten 
whites of the eggs. Bake in three layers. When cold spread with this 
mixture : Peel and grate four large apples, beat into them one cupful of 
sugar, two teaspoonfuls of melted butter and two whipped eggs. Pour 
into a porcelain saucepan and stir steadily over a moderate fire until the 
mixture has boiled one minute. Remove from the fire, add two tea- 
spoonfuls of lemon juice, a dash of powdered cinnamon and two table- 
spoonfuls of minced almonds. Cool it and build the cake, sprinkling 
the top with powdered sugar. Cap the top generously with whipped 
cream, flavored, and serve at the table. 

Apple Sauce Cake. — ^One cup sugar, y^ cup shortening, one saltspoon 
salt, y2 teaspoon ground cloves, one teaspoon cinnamon, j4 teaspoon 
grated nutmeg, 1^ cup raisins, more fruit if desired; one teaspoon soda 
dissolved in a little water, one cup unsweetened apple sauce. Put the 
dissolved soda into the sauce, let it foam over the ingredients; 154 cup 
flour; bake 45 minutes. 

Apricot Shortcake. — Drain the juice away from the fruit, and cut it 
in small pieces. Set in a warm place and proceed to mix the cake. This 
calls for one cupful of flour, four teaspoonfuls of baking powder, two 
teaspoonfuls of sugar, and half a teaspoonful of salt sifted together. 
Into this work four tablespoonfuls of butter, add three-fourths of a 
cupful of milk, and stir into a light dough. Roll in a floured bowl, and 
when one-fourth of an inch thick cut into generous squares. Brush 
the squares with melted butter, lay one on top of the other, and bake in 
a hot oven. When done separate the pieces, spread the fruit between the 
layers and on top, and pile whipped cream over all. A sweet sauce which 
may be served with the shortcake is made by adding to a cupful of the

fruit juice one tablespoonful of cornstarch wet in a little water and 
boiled for a few minutes. A tablespoonful of butter is melted into the 
sauce and a tablespoonful of lemon juice is added just before serving. 

Bath Cake. — One cup of sugar, one-half cup of butter, two-thirds Of 
a cup of sweet milk, whites of four eggs beaten to a stiff froth, two cup's 
of flour, one teaspoonful of baking powder and one-fourth teaspoonful 
of baking soda. Flavor with vanilla. Bake in square, shallow tins (two 
will be required). These cakes should be iced in the tins, while warm, 
and glazed in a hot oven. Then score the icing (without cutting the 
cake or allowing the icing to harden) into two-inch squares, placing in 
the center of each square one-half of an English walnut. Set away 
in tins in a cool place until thoroughly cold, when the squares may be 
cut out. These little cakes look very pretty and are quite a delicacy. 

Black Angel Cake. — One egg, half a cupful of sweet milk, half d 
cupful of sugar, one-third cake Baker's unsweetened chocolate. Cook 
these ingredients till it thickens and let cool while making the cake part 
as follows : One cupftll of sugar, half cupful butter creamed, two eggs 
beaten separ?tely, half cupful sweet milk, two cupfuls flour, half tea- 
spoonful soda in the milk (do not use any cream of. tartar), half 
teaspoonful vanilla. Mix the cake thoroughly, then add the chocolate 
paste and beat well. Bake in two layers and put together with white 
icing. This is a delicious cake.

one cup of currants, quarter of a pound of citron shredded and a tea- 
spoonful each of ground cloves, allspice and cinnamon sifted with four 
cups of browned flour and two teaspoonfuls of baking powder. Mix 
the fruit in with the butter and sugar instead of flouring it to prevent 
the fruit from sinking when brown flour is used in the cake. A little 
flour may be required to make the batter stiff, as browning the flour 
lessens the thickening property. 

Blackberry Jam Cake. — One and one-quarter cupful of sugar; one- 
half cupful butter; four eggs; four tablespoonfuls of loppered milk; , one 
small teaspoonful soda;' two cupfuls flour; one teaspoonful of cinnamon;

teaspoonfuls of baking powder, a heaping tablespoonful of sugar and a 
teaspoonful of salt; sift well together. Beat one egg until light; add 
IJ/2 cupful of milk. Make a well in the center of the flour and gradually 
pour in the liquid, stirring in the flour. In this way you can keep the 
batter smooth. Make it to the consistency of cake batter. Melt two

level tablespoonfuls of butter and add to the batter; then two cupfuls of 
floured blueberries. Bake in the little custard cups or muffin rings, 
allowing a little longer time than for plain muffins. Blackberries are 
nice used in this way. 

Bohemian Butter Kuchen. — Dissolve one cake of dry yeast in a half 
cup of warm milk; then add another cup of warm milk, one and one-half 
cups of flour, one-half teaspoon of salt and beat to a smooth batter; let 
rise till very light. Cream together half a cup of butter, half a cup of 
sugar, two eggs and the grated rind of a lemon. Add this to the sponge 
and enough flour to make a soft dough. Let rise again to double its 
size; divide into three parts (handle as little as possible). Put each part 
in a shallow buttered pan and let rise again to double its height. Pour 
over each two tablespoonfuls melted butter, sprinkle with three table- 
spoonfuls of sugar and a little cinnamon.. Bake 25 minutes.

half a cupful of butter; add the well-beaten yolks of four eggs and 
half a cupful of strong cold coffee. Ground cloves, cinnamon, allspice 
and nutmeg to taste ; 2J4 cupfuls of flour sifted with two teaspoonfuls of 
baking powder, and last of all the whites of the eggs beaten to a stiff 
froth and folded in. Bake in two layers and fill in and ice with dark 
caramel icing, made as follows : Put four cupfuls of brown sugar in a 
saucepan with a cupful of sweet cream or rich milk and boil until it will 
thread from a spoon. Take from the fire and beat until nearly cold and 
then put between the layers and over the cake. 

Butter Cookies. — Cream together one cupful of butter and one-half 
cupful of light brown sugar; then add one teaspoonful of vanilla and one 
well-beaten egg. Slowly stir iu two cupfuls of flour. Mold lightly with 
the hand. Take out a small portion of the dough each time; roll as thin 
as a silver dollar, cut the cookies with a cutter no larger than the dollar. 
Bake in a moderate oven until a golden brown. This will make one 
pound and a quarter of rich, crisp cookies. 

Butternut Cake. — Beat half a cup of butter to a cream. Gradually 
beat in 54 of a cup of granulated sugar, and then one cup of butternut 
meats and one egg beaten without separating. Sift together two cups of 
entire wheat flour, one-third of a cup of pastry flour, one-half teaspoon- 
ful soda, one-fourth teaspoonful salt, one-half teaspoonful mace, one- 
fourth teaspoonful cloves, and J^ teaspoonful cinnamon. Add this to 
the first mixture alternately with one cup of sour milk. Beat thoroughly 
and turn into little tins fitted with rounds of paper on the bottoms and 
thoroughly buttered. Bake about 25 minutes. The recipe makes 18 
cakes. When cold, ice with the icing made of brown sugar, and deco- 
rate with halves of butternut meats. The icing is made as follows : 
Boil one cup of brown sugar and one-third cup of water to 240 de-

grees Fahrenheit. Then pour in a fine stream on to the white of one 
egg, beaten very light. Continue the beating while the syrup is being 
added to the egg and for some minutes afterward. Without a ther- 
mometer, to decide the temperature, boil the sugar until it spins a thread 
about three inches in length. 

Chocolate Cake. — Two eggs, one-half cup butter, one-half cup cocoa, 
one cup milk, one cup sugar, two teaspoonfuls baking powder; two tea- 
spoonfuls vanilla, a good cup and one-half of flour. If it is not the

square pan. When cold cover with the following icing: To one and one- 
half cupful of sugar add one-half cupful of sweet milk. Place on stove 
and cook, after it begins to boil, for four minutes. Do not stir it. Pour 
cut on a platter and beat until thick enough to spread on the cake. 
While making this frosting have one and one-half square of chocolate 
melting, and after covering the cake with the frosting spread the choco- 
late smoothly over it. 

Coffee Cake. — Cream one-quarter cup of butter with one cup of sugar, 
add one egg beaten, one-half cup milk, a pinch of salt and one and one- 
half cupfuls of sifted flour with a teaspoonful of baking powder. Spread

strong coffee, one-half cup molasses, one teaspoonful soda, one cup rai- 
sins, one teaspoonful cinnamon, one teaspoonful cloves, one-half teaspoon- 
ful nutmeg. Flour for thick batter, adding one level teaspoonful baking 
powder. For frosting without eggs, use one cupful of granulated sugar, 
five tablespoonfuls of milk; boil four or five minutes till it threads from 
the spoon. Flavor as desired. Add ehocolate or not. Stir till right 
thickness for spreading. This is fine-grained, white (if chocolate is not 
used) and delicious.

with plain or boiled icing. 

Dolly Varden Cake. — Cream one-half cup butter with one cup sugar. 
Add one-half cup milk alternately with one and one-half cup of flour 
ill which has been mixed one teaspoonful baking powder. Lastly fold 
in the dry-beaten whites of three eggs and flavor to taste. Bake in loaf 
for one-half hour in a moderately quick oven. For icing make a syrup 
of one and one-half cup sugar and eight tablespoonfuls water. Boil, 
when this strings from spoon, add the well-beaten yolks of three eggs 
and continue beating for one-half hour. Flavor like cake and pour 
thickly over the cake. 

Doughnuts, Best. — One egg beaten light; one cupful of sugar and a 
little salt ; one cupful of sour milk sweetened with one teaspoonful of 
soda; two tablespoonfuls of melted lard; flour to make a stiff dough. 
Fry in hot lard, and dust with cinnamon and granulated sugar. These

blespoonfuls of shortening, three cupftils of sugar, four eggs, five tea- 
spoonfuls of baking powder, three cupfuls milk, salt, nutmeg, and lastly

ing chop fine, having two cupfuls; then simmer in two cupfuls of molasses 
until apples are soft. Cream two cupfuls of sugar with a scant cupful 
of butter; add three well beaten eggs; then the apples and molasses;

THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 97 

teaspoonfuls baking powder and half a teaspoonful each of cinnamon, 
cloves and grated nutmeg. Bake in very 'moderate oven as you would 
fruit cake. 

Dutch Cake. — Take two pounds of raised bread dough, one pint of 
sugar, half a cupful of butter (or more if it is to be made quite rich), 
half a nutmeg grated, one teaspoonful of cinnamon and a pound of large 
laisins. Mix well and put in a greased pan. Let it rise about three- 
quarters of an hour, or until the loaf is nearly double its original size, 
and bake in a moderate oven. This is very good when fresh; if we wish 
to make it richer we use an egg, which is mixed in with the butter. Us- 
ing currants instead of raisins, we have the English currant loaf. The 
same recipe makes very nice buns. 

Election Cake. — Rub into half a pound of sifted flour five ounces of 
butter, add a saltspoonful of salt, one cupful of sugar; mix. Scald two 
cupfuls of milk, and when lukewarm add one yeast cake dissolved, and 
two eggs well beaten. Make a' hole in the center of the flour, pour in 
the milk mixture, stir in a little of the flour; cover and stand aside for 
three hours. Then beat in all the flour, add the juice of three oranges, 
a tablespoonful of cinnamon and half a ' nutmeg grated; turn into a 
greased round pan and, when very light, bake in a moderate oven for 
one hour.

to a cream ; add a cupful of milk, measure two cupfuls of sifted flour, 
add three teaspoonfuls of baking powder, a level teaspoonful of cinna- 
mon, half a teaspoonful of grated nutmeg and a pinch of cloves. Sift 
several times until the flour is light and fluffy, then stir into the other 
materials, add cupful seeded floured raisins. Bake in moderate oven. 

Eggless Cake with Oil. — Cream one-half cup oil and one cupful sugar, 
one cupful sour milk, one teaspoonful soda, one teaspoonful each of cas- 
sia and cloves, one-half cupful chopped raisins (if desired) one-half 
teaspoonful salt, two cupfuls warmed flour. Be sure not to forget the 
salt, as the oil contains none. This must always be remembered ; in using 
the oil add twice as much salt as common. 

Eggless Fruit Cake. — One cup of sugar, one cup of butter, one cup of 
buttermilk, two cups of sifted flour, one cup of raisins (seeded and 
chopped), one teaspoonful of cinnamon, one-half teaspoonful of cloves, 
one-half teaspoonful of nutmeg. Beat the sugar and butter to a cream; 
dissolve the soda in a little hot water and stir it into the milk, and add 
next the spices. Flour the raisins and add them last. Bake in a well-but- 
tered tin, on the bottom of v/hich place a clean white paper, also well 
buttered.

of butter, one cupful of sweet milk, one teaspoonful of soda, two of 



98 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

cream of tartar, one tablespoonful of cornstarch made smooth in a little 
milk, two cupfuls of flour. Bake in thin sheets and put together with 
boiled sugar frosting, jelly, cocoanut or any other rich filling desired, 
finish the top with the boiled sugar frosting made by boiling together a 
cupful of sugar and one of water until it will turn creairiy white and 
thick on being stirred. This is quite as delicious as the frosting made 
from the whites of eggs. 

Noel Fruit Cake. — This contains neither butter nor eggs. One pound 
fat salt pork chopped fine, one cupful brown sugar, one cupful New Or- 
leans molasses in which is dissolved one teaspoonful of soda, one pound 
each of raisins, currants and figs chopped fine, one-fourth pound of 
citron chopped fine, one wineglass of coffee (substituted for brandy), 
214 cupfuls of flour well browned. This will make one large loaf or two 
small ones. The longer kept the better it is. This may be iced or not. 
A boiled milk frosting is good while eggs are high. 

Eggless Waffles. — Mix at night a batter with sour milk if you have 
it; if not, sweet will answer. To each quart of milk, with flour for bat- 
ter, add one tablespoonful each of butter and sugar, one-half teaspoonful 
salt. If sweet milk is used add small quantity yeast or one-quarter com- 
pressed yeast cake. In the morning add enough baking soda to correct 
acidity — ^you will have to try baking a little to get it right. 

Russian Fried Cakes. — Scald one pint of milk, add one scant tea- 
spoonful of salt and one tablespoonful of sugar; when lukewarm add 
one yeast cake dissolved in a little warm water, and sufficient flour to 
make a drop batter, and set aside to rise. When light and spongy add 
one-half cupful of butter, creamed together with one cupful of sugar 
and three eggs ; beat until thoroughly mixed ; add sufficient flour to 
make a soft dough and knead for five minutes. Return to the bowl; 
cover and keep in a warm place until light. Turn out on a floured board; 
roll out quite thin and cut into three-inch circles. On one-half of these 
cakes place a small spoonful of any firm jam or marmalade. Cover with 
the remaining cakes and pinch each together securely. Cover with a 
floured cloth, and let stand for 20 minutes ; then drop a few at a time 
into smoking hot fat. When well browned and puffed up draw on un- 
glazed paper and roll in powdered sugar. 

Fruit Cake. — Three pounds flour, one pound butter, yi pound lard, 
two pounds stoned raisins, two pounds currants, one pound mixed can- 
died peel, sliced, two teaspoonfuls each of ground allspice, cinnamon,

cup milk; eight eggs; two teaspoonfuls baking powder. If all baked 
in one loaf bake for four hours. 

Graham Fruit Cake. — Sift three cups of sifted graham flour, two cups 
of white flour, one teaspoon each of clove, allspice, soda and salt and 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 99 

two teaspoons of cinnamon. To two cups of sugar add one cup of mo- 
lasses and two cups of milk alternately with the sifted flour mixture. 
Beat thoroughly and add three cups each of seeded raisins and citron, 
both slightly floured. Bake in a moderate oven for one hour. 

Maple Sugar Fruit Cake. — Cream one cupful of butter and add to it 
two cupfuls of maple sugar, one of maple syrup, three beaten eggs, one 
small cupful of milk with a rounding teaspoonful of soda dissolved in it, 
five cupfuls of flour sifted with two teaspoonfuls of cream tartar and a 
little salt. Mix all together and add one pound of raisins, one of cur- 
rants, half a pound of citron and a quarter of a pound of orange peel, 
all well floured. No spices are used, as the maple sugar flavors the 
cake. 

Old-Fashioned Fruit Cake. — This is intended for rolling out and bak- 
ing in flat pans, instead of the usual loaf. Take two and a half cupfuls 
of sugar, creamed up with half a cupful of butter, half a cupful of sour 
milk, a teaspoonful of soda, half a teaspoonful each of cinnamon, nut- 
meg and ground cloves, a cupful of raisins and one of currants, with a 
little chopped citron and enough flour to make quite stiff. Knead all 
together, roll about two inches thick and bake in a moderate oven. 
Spread the layers with boiled sugar frosting and cut into squares before 
the frosting hardens. 

Poor Man's Fruit Cake. — Seed and chop a quarter of a pound of 
dates; mix with them one cupful of seeded raisins, and dust them with 
one-half cupful of flour. Dissolve a level teaspoonful of baking soda in 
two tablespoonfuls of warm water; add to it half a pint of very thick 
sour cream, stir a moment and add one cupful of brown sugar, half a 
tumblerful of currant or blackberry jelly, a tablespoonful of cinnamon, a 
teaspoonful of allspice and two cupfuls and a half of flour. Beat thor- 
oughly, add the fruit, mix well and turn into a greased square pan. Bake 
in a very slow oven for one hour and a half. This cake will be quitte 
equal to plain fruit cake if the cream is very thick, and it is allowed to 
stand a week before cutting. 

German Cookies. — To one cup of sugar, one cup of butter, one cup 
of lard, one cup of molasses, the juice and grated rind of one lemon, 
one tablespoonful of vinegar, one teaspoonful each of cinnamon and 
ginger, one and one-half teaspoonful of soda, add one ^gg, one cup of 
nuts, one tablespoonful each of candied citron and orange peel chopped 
fine and flour enough to make stiff. The dough must be stiff or the 
cookies will not retain the shape in baking. 

Colonial Gingerbread. — Put a cupful of New Orleans molasses in a 
mixing bowl with half a cupful of butter and half a cupful of sugar. 
Over this pour a cupful of boiling water in which a level dessertspoonful 
of soda has already been dissolved. Stir well, and let the mixture 



100 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

cool ; then add a cupful of chopped walnuts and a cupful of seeded rai- 
sins, a teaspoohful each of cinnamon and ginger, two and one-half cup- 
fuls of flour, and, lastly, two well-beaten eggs. Bake in a shallow pan 
and serve while still warm from the oven. 

Honey Gingerbread. — Warm a generous half cup of butter and beat, 
into it two cups of strained honey. When you have a light cream beat 
in one tablespoon of powdered sugar, a tablespoon of ginger and one- 
half teaspoon of cinnamon. Add the beaten yolks of four eggs, and al- 
ternately with the frothed whites, three even cups of flour sifted twice 
with one teaspoon of baking powder. Beat hard for one minute and 
bake in buttered shallow pans for 45 minutes. Keep covered for 30 
minutes. 

Shiny Gingerbread. — This is very crackly and shiny on top. The 
secret of making it thus is to pour the shortening boiling hot on the 
molasses and beat the batter as little as possible. Pour a small half- 
teacupful of boiling hot shortening) lard and butter, or beef suet and 
butter mixed, upon one-half pint of New Orleans molasses ; add two 
tablespoonfuls of milk, a tablespoonful of ground ginger, a teaspoonful 
of cinnamon; then sift in about three-quarters of a pint of flour, to 
which a teaspoonful of baking soda has been added ; lastly add a well- 
beaten egg, then mix with a few deft turns of the spoon and bake in one 
large pan or two small ones in a moderate oven; serve hot, and break, 
not cut, at the table. 

Ginger Snaps. — Beat together one cupful of sugar, one egg, and one 
tablespoonful of ginger. Heat one cupful of molasses to the scalding 
point, stir into it one teaspoonful of soda or saleratus, and, while it 
foams, pour it over the butter and egg, and beat together. Add a table- 
spoonful of vinegar, and stir in lightly enough flour to roll out and cut 
the dough. 

Half-Pound Cake. — ^One pound of sugar, one pound of flour, one-half 
pound of butter, one teacupful of milk, four eggs. Flavor to taste. Whip 
up the sugar and eggs, putting in one egg at a time. Then stir in the 
milk and flavoring, following this with the flour, which must be very 
thoroughly beaten into the batter. Pour into paper-lined tins and bake 
in a steady oven for 45 minutes. This quantity should make two loaves. 
The oven must be well regulated, and care taken to avoid any jar, or 
the cake will be apt to fall in the middle. 

Hardenburg Cake. — This is an old-fashioned Dutch fruit cake. 
Cream together a pound and a half of butter and two pounds of gran- 
ulated sugar. Add one-half pint of New Orleans molasses, the beaten 
yolks of 12 eggs, two ounces of mixed spices — mace, cinnamon and 
cloves, two grated nutmegs, one-half pound candied peel — two pounds 
cleansed and dried currants, four pounds stoned and cut raisins, one- 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 101 

half pint pickled fruit syrup or boiled-down cider, and flour to make the 
ingredients liang together. If not self-raising flour, add a dessertspoonful 
of baking powder. About a pound and a quarter of flour will be re- 
quired. Lastly, fold in the stiffly beaten whites of the eggs. Bake three 
or four hours in a moderate even, taking care not to disturb. 

Honey Apple Cake. — Wash two cupfuls of dried apples (old-fash- 
ioned kind are the best) and soak them over night. Next morning drain 
them and mince as fine as possible and simmer for two hours in a pint 
of honey. Pour into a bowl and add while hot half a cupful of butter, 
stir until butter is melted and mixed, then let cool. Add a cupful of 
sifted sugar and half a cupful of milk, a teaspoonful each of cloves and 
cinnamon, the grated rind of half a lem.on, two eggs well beaten and 
two cupfuls of flour in which you have mixed two teaspoonfuls of baking 
powder. Line long, shallow tins with buttered paper and pour in the 
batter to depth of half an inch. When baked cut into strips size of 
lady fingers and dust the surface with powdered sugar. 

Hot Cross Buns. — Sift into a large bowl one full quart of flour, half 
a cupful of sugar, and half a teaspoonful of salt; dissolve one-fourth 
of a cupful of butter in a generous half-pint of warm milk, and add to 
the dry ingredients, with the yolks of two beaten eggs; add half a 
yeast cake dissolved in a little water, half a nutmeg grated, and the 
whites of the two eggs, beaten stiff; this should make a very soft dough. 
Cover the bowl with a clean cloth, place it where it will keep warm, 
and let it rise over night. Li the morning take pieces of the dough the 
size of an egg and, with a little flour, mold them into round calces an 
inch in thickness. Place them on a buttered tin, leaving a little space 
between. Cover the tins and set in a warm place for the buns to rise; 
they should be double their original size. With a sharp knife cut a 
cross in the center of each bun. Bake them in a moderate oven for 
about half an hour. When the buns are baked, brush the top with a 
syrup made of sugar and water. A few currants or a little candied 
peel is usually added to this recipe. 

Icing, Plain. — Dissolve one cupful of granulated sugar in one-quarter 
of a cupful of hot water; flavor with essence of vanilla or some orange 
juice and cook until it threads. Then pour it slowly over the whipped 
white of an egg, beating the mixture all the time until cool. 

Imperial Cake. — One pound of sugar, one pound of flour, three-quar- 
ters pound of butter, one pound of almonds, blanched and cut fine; one- 
half pound of citron, one-quarter pound candied cherries, one-half pound 
of seeded raisins, rind and juice of one lemon, two pieces of candied 
orange, one nutmeg, 10 eggs. Bake in a loaf in a moderate oven. This 
is a rich and delicious cake, that can be made some time before it is used. 

Grandmother's Jumbles. — Work three-quarters of a pound of butter 



102 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

into a pound and a half of flour and half a pound of sugar. Flavor with 
grated nutmeg, cinnamon or lemon extract, and add three well beaten 
eggs. Work all well together into a smooth paste and roll out an eighth 
of an inch in thickness. Sprinkle crushed loaf sugar over it and cut into 
round cakes with a very small cutter; take out the center. Lay on bak- 
ing sheets and bake in a quick oven, without browning, about 10 minutes. 

Jumbles Without Eggs. — A half cupful each of butter and slightly 
soured milk, one cupful of sugar, a half teaspoonful of soda, saltspoonful 
of salt, the same of nutmeg and cinnamon mixed, the grated yellow rind 
of half a lemon, and a teaspoonful of lemon juice, two cupfuls of flour 
to stiffen. Bake in rings in a hot oven. A cupful of clean, light, new- 
fallen snow stirred into cake, or other batters, briskly, the very last thing 
before turning it into the baking pan, is a good substitute for eggs. When 
snow is used a little more flour is required — about two tablespoonfuls. 

Lady Baltimore Cake.. — One cupful of butter, two cupfuls of sugar, 
three and one-half cupfuls of flour, one cupful sweet milk, the whites 
of six eggs, two level teaspoonfuls of baking powder and a teaspoonful 
of rose water. Mix as directed for white cakes and bake in three layers, 
with this filling: Dissolve three cupfuls of granulated sugar in one cup- 
ful of boiling water, cook until it threads, then pour gradually over the 
stiffly-beaten whites of three eggs, stirring constantly. Add to this icing 
one cupful of chopped raisins, one cupful of chopped nut meats (pecans 
preferred), and five figs cut hi very thin strips. Ice and emboss top and 
sides of cake. 

Lady Fingers. — Beat the whites of three eggs until very stiff, then beat 
in gradually one-third of a cup of sugar and just a bit of salt. Beat the 
yolks of three eggs until light and thick and add to the whites, putting 
in at the same time a little vanilla extract. Fold in one-third of a cup 
of flour. Shape on a buttered tin to resemble those sold in the shops; 
(hat is, make them very thin and about four and one-half inches long by 
one inch wide. Dust with confectioner's sugar and bake in a moderate 
oven. About eight minutes will be required for the baking. 

Lebkuchen.- — Take a cupful of butter and one of sugar, pour over them 
two cupfuls of honey heated to the boiling point. Add a generous handful 
of blanched almonds, a grated nutmeg and a teaspoonful of cinnamon. 
Dissolve a scant teaspoonful of soda in water and add to the ingre- 
dients. Mix with flour until the dough is as stiff as for ginger cookies. 
Roll out like cookies. Cut into oblong cakes and bake until well 
browned. 

Lemon Sponge Cake. — Three eggs, one-half cupful granulated sugar, 
one-half cupful of sifted flour, the juice and grated rind of one lemon, 
one-half teaspoonful of baking powder. Beat the whites of eggs very 
stiff, beat the yolks and add. When well mixed add the sugar slowly 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 103 

and beat; grate the outside of rind of lemon and add the juice, then 
beat all with egg beater three minutes. Sift in the flour in which the 
baking powder has been mixed and stir slowly and carefully, but do not 
beat after flour is in. Bake in a moderate oven 35 minutes. 

Maple Layer Cake. — Make a tender layer cake by any good recipe, and 
bake in three large layers. For a filling take two cupfuls of maple su- 
gar, add one cup of water and boil until it will wax when dropped in 
cold water. Then remove from the fire and add two teaspoonfuls of but- 
ter and stir speedily till it will spread on the cake. Add one-half tea- 
spoonful of vanilla and put between the layers. 

Molasses Cookies. — Take one cupful of sugar and one cupful of but- 
ter or good shortening. Cream them and add two cups of molasses and 
two eggs. Dissolve two good-sized teaspoonfuls of soda in a little hot 
v/ater, and fill up the cup it is in with cold water. Add it to the other 
mixture and stir in enough flour to make a soft dough, but one that can 
be rolled out and cut into cookies. Spice to suit the taste. 

Delicious Nut Cake. — Cream half a cupful of sugar, adding the stiffly 
beaten whites of three eggs and beating very light; then add, by alter- 
nate bits, two-thirds of a cupful of milk and one and a half cupfuls of 
flour mixed with two level teaspoonfuls of baking powder. At the last 
turn in a cupful of minced English walnut meat and bake in a shallow 
tin. When the cake is cool cover with icing, mark in squares and put 
nut meat on the top of each. 

Nut Wafers. — Two eggs, one cup of sugar, two tablespoonfuls of 
flour, one cup of nut meats chopped fine. Hickorynuts are preferred, 
and the sugar should be light brown. Spread the mixture in a very thin 
layer on a well-greased tin and bake ten minutes or until well tinged 
with brown. Cut in squares and remove from the tin as soon as they are 
done, that the wafers may grow crispy in the air. 

Oatmeal Cookies. — Cream tliree-fourths of a cupful of butter with one 
cupful of sugar; add two well-beaten eggs. Sift three-fourths of a tea- 
spoonful of soda into two cupfuls of flour; add one-half a teaspoonful 
of salt, one teaspoonful of cinnamon ; now add to the mixture two cup- 
fuls of uncooked rolled oats and one scant cupful of chopped raisins 
sprinkled with a little flour. Drop by the teaspoonful into a greased 
pan; bake in moderate ov«n. 

Oatmeal Crisps. — One table.'-.poonful of butter, creamed, one cup of 
sugar, added gradually ; two and one-half cups rolled oats ; two teaspoons 
baking powder well mixed with the oats; two eggs, well beaten, one- 
half teaspoon of salt and two teaspoons vanilla in the eggs. Mix in the 
order given; bake in a medium to slow oven. A heaping teaspoonful of 
mixture makes a dainty crisp. Allow room for them to spread in the 
pan. If you cannot get on without flour use a little best bread flour — 
not pastry. 



104 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Oatmeal Macaroons. — Cream two level tablespoonfuls of butter, scant 
measure; add gradually half a cup of sugar, then the beaten yolks of 
two large eggs beaten again with half a cup of sugar. Then stir in 2-/2 
cupfuls of rolled oats, mixed with 2^ level teaspoonfuls of baking 
powder and one-fourth teaspoonful of salt. Flavor with one teaspoonful 
of vanilla, then fold in the whites of two eggs, beaten dry. Drop with a 
teaspoon on to a buttered baking-sheet, making little rounds about three 
inches apart, and bake in a slow oven. 

Orange Cake. — Sift together four times V/2 cupful of flour and IJ^ 
teaspoonful of baking powder. Beat well two eggs, add one cupful of 
sugar, one-half cupful of milk, one tablespoonful of melted butter and 
the same quantity of orange juice; then the sifted flour and baking pow- 
der. Bake in a square, shallow tin. When cooked split open and fill . 
with a cream made as follows : Into a cup squeeze the juice of one 
orange, add a tablespoonful of lemon juice and hot water to fill the cup, 
put this on to cook in a double boiler, thicken with one tablespoonful of 
cornstarch wet with cold water, and add the grated rind of half an 
orange, one teaspoonful of butter, two heaping tablespoonfuls of sugar 
and the yolk of an egg. 

Othello Cake, or Devil's Food. — Part first — One cupful of dark brown 
sugar ; one-half cupful of butter ; one egg and yolks of two ; one-half 
cupful sweet milk; one teaspoonful soda, two cupfuls flour, measured 
before sifting; two teaspoonfuls vanilla extract. Part second — One cup- 
ful dark brown sugar, one cupful grated chocolate, one-half cupful sweet 
milk. Grate the chocolate, adJ milk and sugar, put in a double boiler, 
and place on the back of stove until dissolved; but do not boil. Prepare 
this first and have dissolving while preparing part first. To mix part 
first, cream the butter, sugar and eggs, together, dissolve the soda in milk, 
and add to butter and sugar. Add the flour tablespoonful at a time 
until all is in, beating lightly. Beat part seco-nd into part first and bake 
in two layers. 

Panoche Cake. — Make any good white cake, and bake in two layers. 
Make a filling as follows : Boil together two cupfuls of brown sugar and 
one-half cupful milk until they harden in cold water. Then add a tea- 
spoonful of vanilla and a tablespoonful of butter. Stir while cooking. 
To half of this mixture add one-half cupful of English walnut meats; as 
soon as cool enough spread between the layers. Spread the remainder 
of the mixture on top of the cake, and decorate with half walnut meats. 

Peanut Cookies. — One-half cupful of butter, one cupful granulated 
sugar, one-half cupful milk, one egg, one pint flour, two teaspoonfuls 
baking powder, one heaping cupful chopped peanuts. Cream the butter 
and sugar, add the milk and egg — beating white and yolk separately — 
ihen the baking powder mixed with part of the flour, and lastly the re-

mainder of the flour, in which has been mixed the nuts. Handle very 
I'ttle and do not roll too thin. 

Pork Cake. — One pound of fat salt pork, chopped fine, and dissolved 
i". one pint of boiling water, three cups of brown sugar, one cup mo- 
lasses, one pound each of raisins and currants, two tablespoonfuls of 
cinnamon, one teaspoonful cloves, two nutmegs grated, grated zest of one 
orange and lemon, one teaspoonful baking soda, two teaspoonfuls of 
cream of tartar, seven cups of sifted flour. Bake in moderate oven. 
This amount makes three medium-sized loaf cakes. 

Potato Cake. — Two cups sugar, one-half cup butter, one cup hot 
mashed potato, four eggs beaten, one-half cup milk, one-fourth tea- 
spoon nutmeg, one-fourth teaspoon cloves, one-half teaspoon cinnamon, 
one cup walnut meats chopped fine, two rounding cups flour, two tea- 
spoons baking powder, two ounces chocolate melted over hot water and 
mixed with potato; add to sugar and butter and mix as usual. Bake in 
three layers and put together with frosting. 

Pound Cake. — Mix a pound of sugar with three-quarters of a pound 
of butter. When worked white, stir in the yolks of eight eggs beaten to 
a froth, then the whites. Add a pound of sifted flour and mace or nutmeg 
to taste. If you wish to have your cake particularly nice, stir in, just 
before you put it into the pans, a quarter of a pound of citron or al- 
monds blanched, and powdered fine in rosewater. 

Raised Cake. — Two cupfuls light sponge, one cupful sugar, one-half 
cupful butter, two well-beaten eggs, one cupful stoned raisins, floured, 
half a nutmeg, grated, one-half teaspoonful soda dissolved in a little 
water. Make into a loaf or loaves, and when light bake in rather slow 
oven, as it scorches easily. If desired, cover it with a milk icing, for 
which use 10 teaspoonfuls sweet milk, 1}4 cupful sugar. Boil six min- 
utes, take from stove and stir until quite white, flavor, spread quickly 
with a knife dipped in cold water. 

Raisin-Cake Squares. — Sift and dry half a pound of flour, rub into this 
two ounces of butter and a very little lard, add three ounces of sugar, a 
teaspoonful of baking powder and six ounces of stoned raisins. Beat 
two eggs with a spoonful of milk, and add to the dry ingredients; add 
a pinch of ground cinnamon and beat all to a light batter; pour into 
a greased pudding tin and bake in a sharp oven; when cooled a little 
cut with a hot knife into squares and serve while still warm. 

Rochester Cake. — Two cups sugar; two-thirds butter; one cup sweet 
milk; three eggs; three cups flour; two teaspoonfuls baking powder; a 
little salt and flavoring. Put half the mixture in two jelly cake pans. To 
the remainder add one tablespoon molasses; one cup chopped raisins or 
currants; one-fourth pound chopped citron; one teaspoon cinnamon; one- 
half teaspoon cloves; one-half teaspoon allspice; a little nutmeg; one 



106 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

tablespoon flour. Put in two other jelly cake pans. Put the cakes to- 
gether while warm with a little jelly or raspberry jam between them, 
dark and light layers alternately. 

Rose Layer Cake. — Two cups of sugar, one cup of butter, a fourth 
of a cup of sweet milk, whites of eight eggs beaten stiff, three and a 
fourth cups of flour and two teaspoonfuls of baking powder. Bake in 
jelly tins. Grease the tins well and dust flour over every part before 
putting in the batter. Boil two cups of powdered sugar in a half tea- 
cupful of water, stirring constantly. When very thick pour boiling-hot 
over the beaten whites of two eggs. Beat until almost cold. Flavor 
with rose extract and color with cochineal. Put the cakes together with 
this icing. For the pink coloring matter, buy five cents' worth of baker's 
cochineal of the druggist, put half a teaspoonful into a cup and cover 
with two teaspoonfuls of boiling water. Let stand an hour, add alum 
(powdered) the size of a large pea, and add drop by drop to the icing 
until of a pretty pink color. 

Sour Cream Cake. — One cup sugar, one cup sour cream, three-fourths 
cup raisins, one level teaspoonful salt, two eggs, two cups flour, one tea- 
spoonful each of saleratus and cinnamon, a saltspoonful ground cloves 
Beat well, bake in loaf or two layers, and use any white frosting for 
covering the cake. For the sour cream icing, use one cup sour cream, 
one and one-half cup sugar (granulated), three- fourths cup ground 
walnuts and hickory nuts. Boil in granite pan to soft ball stage, then stir 
briskly until nearly cold. If this should prove too stiff, add a table- 
spoonful sweet milk. 

Salem Spice Cake. — Cream a half cupful of butter with a cupful of 
sugar, add two eggs — one at a time — and beat until the mixture is very 
light. Sift lYz cupful of flour with one-fourth of a teaspoonful of salt, 
one teaspoonful of cinnamon and half a teaspoonful of cloves. Add the 
flour, a tablespoonful at a time, alternately with a half cupful of cold 
water, and add to the last tablespoonful of flour a teaspoonful of baking 
powder. Stir in a half cupful of cleaned and seeded raisins and bake in 
a shallow, well-greased pan in a moderate oven for 25 minutes. 

Spiced Molasses Wafers. — This is one of the daintiest gingerbreads. 
Oue cupful of brown sugar, one-half of a cupful of molasses, one table- 
spoonful of butter, one-half of a teaspoonful of powdered cinnamon, one- 
quarter of a teaspoonful of cloves, one-quarter of a teaspoonful of all- 
spice, two tablespoonfuls of flour. Put the molasses, sugar and butter in 
a saucepan and boil gently over the fire until, when tried in cold water, 
a little of the mixture can be rolled into a very soft ball between the 
fingers; cover and set aside until cold. Add the spice, then the flour, 
and a pinch of salt. Butter liberally a number of shallow tins." Make 
a tester by dropping a teaspoonful of the mixture on a greased pan and 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 107 

baking it in a hot oven. This is necessary, as with some brands of flour 
a trifle more may be indicated. The mixture will spread very much and 
when taken from the oven the cake will be as thin as a wafer and should 
be taken at once from the pan. 

Berwick Sponge Cake. — Six eggs; powdered white sugar, three cup- 
fuls; sifted flour, four even cupfuls; cream of tartar, two teaspoonfuls ; 
soda, one teaspoonful ; one cupful cold water, one-half of a lemon. 
First beat the eggs two minutes, add the sugar and beat five minutes more, 
then stir the cream of tartar in two cupfuls of the flour and beat one 
minute; dissolve the soda in the water and add; wash the lemon dry, 
then grate the rind and squeeze in the juice'. Finally, add the remaining 
two cupfuls of flour and beat all one minute. Put into deep pans in a 
moderate oven. This will make two bars, or loaves. When it is done 
it smells like fresh popcorn. There is considerable beating about this 
cake, and therein lies the success. You can use three tablespoonfuls 
baking powder (if you wish, in place of cream of tartar and soda), but 
sift it in the two last cupfuls of flour. Have about the same heat as 
for raised bread, put into the oven and let it remain certainly 20 min- 
utes without looking at it. If it can bake until done without the oven 
door being opened, so much the better. 

Boiled Sponge Cake. — One and one-half cupful granulated sugar, two- 
thirds cupful water, boiled until clear; pour over (beating while you 
pour) the whites of five eggs which have been beaten very stiff in a large 
platter; now beat until cold, and add yolk of eggs beaten smooth, juice 
of a half lemon and one cupful of flour folded in gently. Bake in a slow 
oven about three-fourths hour. Bake in oblong pan about two to 2% 
inches deep. Can be iced with any icing preferred, and will keep in- 
definitely. 

Never-Fail Sponge Cake. — This can be made and baked in 35 min- 
utes. A good sponge should be yellow as gold, of velvety softness and 
tender as a marshmallow. If the rule here given is strictly followed, 
such a cake will be the sure result: Separate the whites and yolks of 
four eggs. Beat the whites until stiff enough to remain in bowl if it is 
inverted, then beat into them one-half cup of sugar, which must be fine 
granulated (powdered sugar makes tough cake and proper beating does 
away entirely with the grains). Beat the yolks, add to them one-half 
cupful of sugar, beating for five minutes by the clock — this latter being 
important, as the delicate texture of the cake depends upon it; add to 
the yolks the grated rind and juice of one lemon. Now beat well to- 
gether the yolks and white. At this stage beating is in order, but must 
be absolutely avoided after adding the flour, of which take one cupful. 
The mixture should now look like a puff ball, and the flour is to be 
tossed or stirred into it with a light turn of the wooden spoon. Stirring 



108 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

is quite different from beating. The cupful of sugar must be generous, 
the flour scanty. Bake for 25 minutes in a moderate oven. Just be- 
fore putting in the oven sprinkle on top through a sifter about a table- 
spoonful of granulated sugar. This gives the "crackly"' top crust so 
desirable. 

Tory Wafers. — Melt a teacup of butter, a half a cup of lard, and mix 
them with a quart of flour, a couple of beaten eggs, a teaspoonful of 
salt, and flavoring. Add milk till of the right consistency to roll out;, 
roll it out about the third of an inch in thickness, cut it into cakes with 
a cookie cutter, lay them on buttered baking plates, and bake them a 
few minutes. Frost them as soon as baked, and sprinkle comfits or 
sugar sand on the top. 

Venetian Cake. — This makes a handsome loaf, and is very good. 
Beat together the yolks of six eggs and half a pint of sugar for 20 
minutes. Fold in the stiffly beaten whites and mix in lightly 4J^ 
rounded tablespoonfuls of flour. Pour into a buttered mold dusted 
with equal parts of flour and sugar. Bake half an hour, with an increas- 
ing heat, putting it into a moderate oven at first. When done invert it 
on the pastry rack, and when cold frost with a vanilla chocolate icing. 

Walnut Cake. — Crejim two^hirds of a cupful of butter with one 
cupful of sugar. Separate three eggs ; beat the yolks until creamy and 
add to butter and sugar; then add one cupful of milk alternating with 
three cupfuls of flour (reserve enough of the flour for the nuts), add two 
teaspoonfuls of baking powder, one cupful of nut kernels chopped, and 
last of all fold in the whites of the eggs beaten to a stiff froOh. Bake 
in a loaf tin in a moderate oven from 45 minutes to one hour. 

Walnut Wafers.- — One cup brown sugar, one cup chopped nuts, two 
eggs, one tablespoon butter, flour enough to make very thick dough 
(about eight tablespoonfuls), one teaspoon baking powder, vanilla. Beat 
sugar and yolks together, add nuts, butter and flour; lastly the whites 
beaten stiff and baking powder. Drop by one-half teaspoonful on but- 
tered tins, allowing room to spread. Bake in quick oven. 

Whigs. — Mix half a pound of sugar with six ounces of butter, a 
couple of beaten eggs, a teaspoonful of cinnamon. Stir in two pounds 
of flour, a teacup of yeast, and milk sufficient to make a thick batter. 
When light, bake them in small cups. 

White Fruit Cake.- — The whites of 16 eggs, one pound each of sugar, 
flour and butter, one grated cocoanut, one pound chopped citron, one 
pound chopped blanched almonds, one wineglass of rose water, two tea- 
spoonfuls of baking powder. Flour citron and almonds well;, bake care- 
fully. 



CHAPTER rX. 

EGGS. 

Eggs a la Bonne Femme. — Cut an onion into fine dice, fry it lightly in 
a tablespoonful of butter, then dash in a teaspoonful of vinegar. But- 
ter a shallow dish, sprinkle the fried onion over it, and break in five 
eggs, being very careful that the yolks remain whole. Bake in a hot 
oven until the whites become a delicate film. Dust with salt and white 
pepper. Just before sending to the table sprinkle all over the dish 
coarse bread crumbs fried delicately brown in butter, and garnish with 
watercress or parsley. 

A la Maitre d'Hotel. — Put the eggs in boiling water and boil six 
minutes ; then take from the fire and dip in cold water, taking them 
out immediately; this is to render shelling easy. When shelled, cut the 
eggs through lengthwise and lay them on a hot dish on which maitre 
d'hotel butter has been melted. With a spoon cover the eggs with this 
sauce, which is made as follows : Mix with a spoon on a plate a piece 
of butter the size of an egg with a tablespoonful of finely chopped par- 
sley, a pinch of salt, and pepper. Put it on a hot platter to melt. This 
sauce- is often served with fish, broiled meat or boiled vegetables. It is 
very nice with new potatoes. Eggs boiled as above described are also 
very good with strained tomato, or parsley sauce, while another varia- 
tion is given by using black butter, sauce au beurre noir. To make this, 
brown half a cupful of butter in the frying pan as brown as it can be 
made without burning, then add two tablespoonfuls of vinegar, salt and 
pepper. This sauce is very good with fish also. 

Baked Eggs. — One large cupful of milk, add one teaspoonful of but- 
<er (or more if wished), salt and pepper-to taste, one teaspoonful of 
flour, made smooth with a little extra milk. Boil about three minutes 
and pour in heated dish, then break in five fresh eggs and put in hot 
oven and bake until whites of eggs are set. 

Baked Eggs with Cheese.— Cut 12 hard boiled eggs in thick slices, 
and, having a buttered baking dish well sprinkled with dry crumbs, place 
a layer of eggs in the center. Sprinkle with grated cheese and season 
lightly with salt and paprika. Add another layer of eggs and cheese 
until the dish is filled, finishing with the cheese. Pour in a cream sauce 
thickened with the yolks of three eggs, sprinkle with fresh bread crumbs 
mixed with cheese, dot with butter and bake about 10 minutes in a hot 
oven, or until the crumbs are 3 golden yellow- Serve at once. 



110 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Baked Eggs With Mashed Potatoes. — The potatoes should be well sea- 
soned, and beaten smooth with hot cream or milk and butter, so they 
will be very light. Put in a buttered baking dish, and then with a 
small croquette mold (or if this 's lacking, with a clean egg) make 
deep little hollows in the potatoes. Drop an uncooked egg carefully 
into each of these hollows, dust with salt and pepper, and dot the ;top 
with bits of butter; set in the oven until the eggs are cooked, and serve 
at once. 

Creamed Eggs. — Boil six eggs for about eight minutes. Cool, remove 
shells, and cut into halves. Put two tablespoonfuls of butter in a 
saucepan and blend with the same amount of flour. Add a cup of 
water and stir until smooth. Put in some more butter, season with salt 
and pepper and a little lemon juice. Stir in the eggs and serve on toast. 

Eggs in Cream. — Use very thick cream, a dessert spoonful to each egg 
to cook them in. Put the cream in a large deep granite ware pie dish 
and set on top of the stove for a minute or two, until the cream gets thin. 
Then break in the eggs; sprinkle a little salt and white pepper over 
each egg, set the dish back on the stove, cover close and let stand two 
or three minutes, or until the eggs are nicely set. These are most de- 
licious served with toast and coffee for breakfast. 

Mexican Eggs. — Peel and chop four or five ripe tomatoes and lay 
them in a shallow vegetable dish or on a platter on which the peppers 
are to be served. Remove the stems and seeds from six or eight "very 
tender peppers, and if desired, the skins can be peeled off in this way. 
Put them into a dry frying pan over a moderate fire, moving them 
often until they are sufficiently wilted to allow the removal of the skins. 
This done, put a small bit of cheese in each pepper and return them to 
the pan with a good lump of butter. Fry them gently so the butter will 
not scorch. When done pour three well-beaten eggs slightly salted into 
the pan with the peppers and when set take them up by the spoonful — 
a pepper in each — and lay them on the chopped tomatoes. 

Omelets. — It is always better to make several small omelets than one 
large one, if a number of persons are to be served. It is much more 
likely to turn out well. Nearly everyone has her own special recipe for 
this dish; the regulation French omelet calls for three eggs well beaten, 
to which three tablespoonfuls of water are added, and stirred in lightly. 
A level tablespoonful of butter is melted in a perfectly smooth frying 
pan and the omelet turned in; it is shaken gently to prevent sticking, 
and when cooked rolled over with a flexible knife and slid on to a hot 
dish. It is varied by putting in a filling before rolling over; half a cup 
of grated cheese is very nice, or some jam or jelly for a sweet omelet, 
which makes a rich dessert, Some cooks stir 3 little flour into the first 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. Ill 

egg beaten, and separate the eggs, folding in the beaten whites last; 
this makes a very light and puffy omelet. 

Butteitnilk Omelet. — Four eggs beaten separately, one cupful of but- 
termilk, ont-half teaspoonful of soda, three-quarters cup of finely rolled 
cracker crumlos, a scant teaspoonful of salt, -one-eighth of a teaspoonful 
of pepper. Have two tablespoonfuls of butter hot in a frying pan. 
Turn in omelet and fry a delicate brown. Place in oven for 10 minutes 
and when firm fold and serve. 

Fairy Omelet. — Beat yolks and whites of six eggs separately; add five 
tablespoonfuls of milk to the yolks. Heat a skillet and put in a table- 
spoonful of butter; let it mell, pour in the beaten yolks and pile be- 
tween whites on the top; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cover and 
cook three minutes, slip out on hot platter and serve by cutting through 
yolks and whites. 

French Omelet. — Beat thoroughly, first, the yolks and then the whites 
of the eggs ; to the yolks add a tablespoonful of boiling water, a pinch 
of salt and a dash of pepper; turn the stiff whites into the yolks and 
fold; that is, stir them in so that the air bubbles shall not be broken. 
Turn carefully into a frying pan, in which has been melted a large 
piece of butter. Set where it may cook very slowly, and when well 
browned on one side set in the oven to brown on the other. Send im- 
mediately to the table. The omelet may be varied by dropping chopped 
meat in it, chopped celery, grated cheese, or, if a sweet omelet is de- 
sired, by spreading jelly over and folding. 

Orange Omelet. — Beat yolks of three eggs ; add three tablespoonfuls 
of sugar and the grated rind of one orange; add a pinch of salt to the 
whites of the eggs and beat until stiff; mix the whites lightly with the 
yolks, sprinkling in at the same time three tablespoonfuls of orange 
juice; melt one teaspoonful of butter in a clean, small frying pan till 
the bottom is greased; turn in the egg mixture; cook slowly, turning 
the pan that the bottom may brown evenly; when firm on the bottom 
put pan in a hot oven; fold in half and turn out on a hot platter; 
sprinkle over powdered sugar. 

Pannikins. — Take some little earthen pans, such as are sold for toy 
milk pans, capable of holding one egg only; heat them in the oven, and 
when quite hot take them out, and with a paste brush butter them in- 
side; break an egg carefully into each pan; set them into the oven until 
the white of the egg is hard enough to retain the form of the pan; turn 
them out in a circle on the dish in which they are to be served. On the 
top of each sprinkle a little fresh parsley or grated ham; have ready a 
sauce of bread crumbs beaten up with rich gravy, browned and seasoned; 
place this in the center of the dish, the eggs inclosing it. 



113 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Canadian Poached Eggs. — A cupful of milk is brought to scaMing 
point in a shallow granite vessel, and into this the eggs are gently dropped, 
then covered. The milk is not allowed to boil, merely kept at the scald- 
ing point. The eggs will be ready in about two minutes, w'th the yolk 
inside of a beautiful pearly film. Lift them out carefully with a skim- 
mer and set each egg on a slice of buttered, delicately-browned toast. 
Add to the hot milk one tablespoonful of butter and one tablespoonful 
of flour rubbed smooth, season with pepper and celery salt, beat till 
creamy and pour over the poached eggs. 

Poached Eggs in Glasses. — Add a few grains of salt to the white of 
an egg (a level saltspoonful to five eggs) and beat until dry; turn into 
a buttered glass and form a nest on the top for the yolk, which must 
be kept whole. Put the glass on a trivet, or an inverted tin cover, in a 
covered dish of lukewarm water, letting the water come to within half 
an inch of the top of glasses, and let cook until the egg is set and rises 
in the glass. Do not allow the water which is around the glass to boil. 
Serve at once. Prepare as many eggs in glasses as there are persons 
to be served. Dainty and wholesome for invalids. 

Eggs Poached in Tomato Sauce. — Put into the frying pan one table- 
spoonful of butter, one tablespoonful of flour; heat until frothy; stir 
into it lyi teacupful of tomato (which has been peeled and chopped 
fine and heated) and then strain into the frying pan a dash of cayenne 
pepper and a heaping saltspoonful of salt; cook until creamy, and drop 
in four eggs, baste often, and when whites are set remove and put each 
egg on a quarter of a slice of buttered toast and pour sauce around 
them. 

St. Pancras Eggs. — Separate the yolks from the whites of five eggs; 
keep each yolk separate; whip the whites to a stiff froth, adding a salt- 
spoonful of salt; butter five small cups, put the whites into them and 
carefully drop the yolk into the center of each; dust with salt and pep- 
per; place the cups in a shallow pan of hot water, put in the oven and 
bake five minutes, or till the whites are set. Serve in the cups. 

Egg Salad. — Boil six eggs perfectly hard, putting them on in cold 
water and cooking 10 minutes after this reaches the boil, that the yolks 
may be dry and mealy. Cut the whites in two, remove carefully and rub 
the yoUcs to a paste with three tablespoonfuls of minced ham or chicken 
or both, 10 drops of onion juice, a saltspoonful of mustard, a table- 
spoonful of melted butter, salt to taste and half a teaspoonful of paprika. 
Crowd this mixture back into the halved whites, cutting a bit off the bot- 
tom of each cup, that it may stand upright, and letting the newly formed 
yolk rise above the edge of the white as far as the original yolk would 
have done. Arrange these on lettuce leaves and serve with a French 
dressing or with boiled salad dressing. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 113 

Scalloped Eggs. — Boil eight eggs hard; put in cold water for five 
minutes; then shell and cut into slices with very sharp knife; put a 
layer in small buttered baking dish; sprinkle with fine bread crumbs, 
salted, a das'h of pepper, small dots of butter; fill up dish in this man- 
ner, having the bread crumbs on top with small pieces of butter; have 
ready one cupful of hot milk, into which a teaspoonful of cornstarch 
• dissolved in a tablespoonful of milk has been well stirred, and a pinch 
of salt ; pour milk over eggs and crumbs ; put in a quick oven for 15 
minutes; serve in baking dish. 

Scrambled Eggs. — Break the required number of eggs in a bowl; 
beat until the yolks are broken. Put a lump of butter the size of a 
walnut in a frying pan; as soon as it is melted turn in the eggs, and 
iitir until it is set. Serve immediately. A pleasing change is made in 
scrambled eggs by stirring in a little potted- meat or finely chopped par- 
sley just before serving, and then sprinkling over the top some hot 
browned bread crumbs. 

Scotch Woodcock. — Make a half-pint of cream sauce, using one and 
one-half tablespoonful of butter, one of flour and a cupful of cream. 
Season with one-fourth of a saltspoonful of white pepper, and a half- 
teaspoonful of Worcestershire sauce. Shell and chop fine five hard- 
boiled eggs, add them to the sauce, cook for three minutes and serve 
on well-buttered rounds of crisp toast. 

Welsh Rabbit. — Half a pound of cheese, two eggs, a speck of ca- 
yenner a tablespoonful of butler, on teaspoonful of mustard, half tea- 
spoonful of salt, half a cupful of cream or rich milk. Break the cheese 
in small pieces, and put all the ingredients in a double boiler, or in a 
pan over hot water. Stir until the cheese melts; then spread on toast 
and serve at once. 

Egg Timbales. — Beat four eggs, add to them one cup of milk, half 
teaspoonful salt, and four dashes of pepper.- Pour into buttered custard 
cups, set these in a pan of hot water, and cook in a slow oven until the 
timbales are set in the center. Turn out on a hot dish, and pour over 
them a cream sauce made by placing half a pint of milk in a double 
boiler; rub together a rounding tablespoonful each of butter and flour, 
stir this into the boiling milk until it thickens, add half a teaspoonful of 
salt and four dashes of pepper. 

Egg Toast. — Butter a shallow pudding dish, put in it a layer of toast, 
cut into narrow s'^rips, then a layer of hard-boiled whites of eggs, cut 
into slices, then another layer of toast. Put over this the yolks of the 
hard-boiled eggs, riced by passing through a vegetable press; then pour 
over all a rich cream sauce highly seasoned, and place in the oven until 
it is well browned. 



CHAPTER X. 

VEGETABLES. 

Asparagus. — The average cook rarely tries any other mode than boil- 
ing. Boil the stalks whole, after careful washing, tying in a bundle to 
keep from breaking; drain, lay upon toast, and serve with cream sauce. 
Another way is to cut in inch lengths, and stew in milk, thickening with 
flour, and seasoning with butter, pepper and salt. 

Asparagus a la Vinaigrette. — Cook as for boiled asparagus. While 
cooking make a hot French -dressing by mixing together in a saucepan 
over the fire six tablespoonfuls of salad oil, two of vinegar, two tea- 
spoonfuls of French mustard, half a teaspoonful of sugar, salt and pep- 
per to taste. When the asparagus is tender drain, put in a deep dish 
and pour over it the hot dressing. Cover and set aside to cool, then 
stand in the ice chest for an hour or so before serving. 

Baked Beans with Cream. — Soak and parboil a pint of navy beans 
until half cooked; drain, dash over a quart of cold water, drain again 
and add the last water (boiling) with two heaping teaspoonfuls of salt, 
one-eighth teaspoonful pepper, one large sprig of thyme (minced), two 
tablespoonfuls of beef drippings or the clean, browned trimmings of fat 
from roast beef, and fried steak may be used instead of the drippings; 
when beans are cooked tender turn all into a covered bean pot and 
bake in a very moderate oven five hours. Then pour over the beans a 
cupful of sweet cream and bake an hour longer. 

Baked Beans and Tomato Sauce. — Prepare the beans as for ordinary 
baking, by soaking and parboiling; then put in a crock, with the pork, 
and add the sauce, which should be prepared while the beans are cook- 
ing. Some cooks merely use the juice from a can of tomatoes; we pre- 
fer to use some of the solid part, too. Stew slowly, put through a sieve 
to make it smooth, and flavor with salt, pepper, a small pinch of clove, 
a little mustard, and, if desired, a shred of onion. Do not thicken; pour 
this over the beans, cover and bake. Add a little water from time to 
time if the beans seem to be becoming too dry. A little sugar may be 
added to the sauce if the family taste approves. 

String Beans and Bacon. — Cut one or two slices of tender mild-cured 
bacon in tiny cubes and cook to a delicate brown in the frying pan. 
Add a pint of hot cooked and drained string beans and a few drops of 
onion juice. Shake the frying pan thoroughly. Add salt and pepper as 
needed and turn into a hot dish. Peas may be served in the same way. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 115 

Lyonnaise Beets. — Two cupfuls of boiled beets cut into half-inch 
dice, three tablespoonfuls of vinegar, one tablespoonful of butter, one 
tablespoon of chopped parsley, one-fourth of a teaspoonful of salt, half 
the quantity of pepper. Put all of the ingredients except the beets into 
a double boiler. When well heated add the beets, stir for a few min- 
utes that they may absorb the dressing and serve very hot. 

Baked Summer Cabbage. — Cut into quarters and boil tender in salt 
and water two medium-sized heads of cabbage, drain and chop. Ar- 
range an inch layer in the bottom of a baking dish. Sprinkle with black 
pepper, then crumb in a layer of stale bread. Drop small bits of butter 
over the bread crumbs. Repeat the process until the dish is nearly full, 
bread coming on top. Then pour over the whole one pint of rich milk 
or thin cream, and bake until nicely browned. 

Baked Cabbage With Cheese. — Boil a firm white cabbage for 15 min- 
utes in, salted water, then change the water for more that is boiling, and 
boil until tender. Drain and when cool chop fine. Butter a baking 
vlish, and lay in the chopped cabbage. Put one tablespoonful of butter 
''n a frying pan; when it bubbles stir in one tablespoonful of flour, one 
half-pint of stock, same of boiling water; stir until smooth. Then 
season with saltspoonful salt, half as much pepper, four tablespoonfuls 
grated cheese. Pour over the cabbage, sprinkle cracker crumbs over the 
top, dot with bits of butter and bake in a quick oven 10 minutes. 

Browned Cabbage. — One small cabbage, one tablespoonful of buttter, 
half a cupful of milk, two eggs and bread crumbs. Cut the cabbage into 
small pieces and remove the hard center. Wash the pieces in cold wa- 
ter; then pour boiling water over them and let stand for 10 minutes. 
Drain off the hot water and put the cabbage in boiling salted water to 
cook until tender. When it is done pour off the water, pressing down 
hard on the cabbage, to be sure that all the water has been drained away. 
Chop as fine as possible, beat up the eggs, add the milk and stir all the 
ingredients and seasoning with the cabbage. Put the whole into a but- 
tered baking dish and bake for one hour in a moderate oven. 

Red Cabbage, German Style. — Slice red cabbage thin, cover with 
cold water, and let soak 20 minutes; then drain. Put one quart in a stew 
pan with two tablespoonfuls of butter, one-half teaspoonful of salt, one 
tablespoonful of finely chopped onion and a few gratings each of nut- 
meg and cayenne. Cover, and cook until the cabbage is tender; then 
add two tablespoonfuls of vinegar and one-half tablespoonful of sugar, 
and cook five minutes. 

Carrot Ragout. — Clean and scrape enough new carrots to measure a 
pint; take the same quantity of new potatoes and white turnips, cutting 
them in pieces about the size of the carrots. Cut a half cupful of leeks 
in fine slices, Copk the carrots in boiling water for half an hour and the 



116 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

other vegetables separately for 10 minutes. In a frying pan brown 
slowly together two tablespoonfuls each of butter or dripping and flour ;^ 
add gradually one pint of stock or water and stir until thick and smooth. 
Season with a level tablespoon! ul of sugar, one teaspoonful of salt and 
one-quarter of a teaspoonful of white pepper, add the vegetables, cover 
and simmer gently for half an hour, and before serving stir into it a 
tablespoonful of parsley. 

Baked Corn. — One quart corn scraped from cob; one and one-third 
cupful cream; one heaping tablespoonful of butter; season with salt 
and pepper. Bake one hour. 

Balced Corn and Tomatoes. — Fill an earthen pudding dish with alter- 
nate layers of corn and tomatoes, each about an inch thick. Season each 
v/ith salt, pepper and butter. When the dish is full sprinkle with grated 
bread crumbs and bits of butter. Cover the dish with a plate and bake 
in a moderately hot oven for 20 minutes. Then remove the cover and 
bake 15 minutes longer. 

Corn Chowder. — Cut the kernels from a dozen ears of green corn. 
Peel and mince two onions and fry them brown in three tablespoonfuls 
of butter in a deep saucepan. Now put in the corn, four broken pilot 
biscuits, add a half dozen parboiled and sliced potatoes. Season with 
pepper, salt and a tablespoonful of minced parsley, and cover with a 
quart of boiling water. Let all cook gently for three-quarters of an hour, 
then stir in slowly a cupful of boiling milk, thickened with a tablespoon- 
ful of flour rubbed into one of butter. Turn at once into a heated tureen. 

Escalloped Corn. — Into a buttered dish put a layer of green corn pulp, 
sprinkling with salt and bits of butter. Over this spread a layer of 
cracker crumbs, seasoned and moistened slightly with milk. Fill the dish 
with alternate layers of corn and cracker crumbs, with crackers for top 
layer and plenty of milk over the whole. Cover and bake one hour. 

Hulled Corn. — New England taste demands a well-ripened white flint 
corn for hulling, other sections prefer yellow, but it is always flint corn. 
Babbitt's potash is used to remove the hulls, the proportion being one 
full pound to a bushel of corn. Of course, when preparing corn for 
home use, the same proportion would be observed in smaller quantities. 
An iron kettle half filled with water is put on the stove, the potash added 
when the water warms, and the corn put in when it comes to a boil. In 
about an hour the starch will come out of the corn, thickening the lye. 
The corn must be well stirred from the bottom, to avoid burning, and 
the kettle kept back on the stove, so the corn will simmer without boiling 
hard. After the first hour corn must be dipped out and tested in cold 
water, to see if the hulls slip. If left in the potash too long it becomes 
dark and sodden ; if too short, it cannot be cooked tender. About 1 J^ to 
twQ hour? is the usual time. The corn is then vygshed in clear watfr. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. lir 

When made in large quantities a clean, new broom, with about six inches 
of the straw cut off, is used to rub off the hulls ; a stiff whisk would 
answer the same purpose with small quantities. A quantity of wateK will 
be used during this scrubbing, the hulls being poured off with the water. 
Put the corn on to boil in clear water; when it reaches the boiling point 
draw it back, so that it may simmer. It should not be stirred, as this 
makes it mushy. It requires long, slow simmering; when sufficiently 
cooked it may be salted to taste, and drained in a colander. When 
served it is either eaten with milk, or warmed up with butter in a frying 
pan, and served like a vegetable. In the Summer hulled corn would 
ferment very quickly, so its manufacture takes place only after hard freez- 
ing has started in the Fall. 

Hulled corn may also be prepared as follows : Wash two quarts of 
shelled corn to remove loose bits; then place in a large iron kettle with 
two heaping tablespoons of saleratus, cover with cold water, let come 
to a boil slowly and cook about an hour. Remove the kettle from fire, 
■ drain off the water, then pour the corn, from which the hulls will already 
be loosened, into a large pan of water. Rub the corn between the hands 
to loosen the hulls ; after taking off all those partly loosened put it on 
again in warm water, let boil about half an hour, then try to remove 
the rest of the hulls by rubbing as before. After all hulls are removed, 
wash the corn in at least half a dozen clear waters, then put on once 
more in warm water, and when it boils drain and add fresh water. Let 
the corn cook in this last water until tender, salting to taste. If the 
hulls do not come off readily let the corn boil an hour longer, adding a 
teaspoon more saleratus. 

Corn Pudding. — Two coffeecupfuls of green corn pulp, one cupful of 
new milk, three eggs, two heaping tablespoonfuls of butter. Pour one 
pint of the m.ilk over the corn and set on the fire until scalding hot. Beat 
the yolks of the eggs and add the pint of cold milk and half a cuplul of 
sugar. Put the butter in the corn over the fire, and then add the milk 
and yolks of eggs and a little salt. Put in a buttered pudding dish and 
bake slowly. Make a meringue of the whites of the eggs and powdered 
sugar and spread over the top when pudding is done, browning slightly. 

Succotash. — Cook one pint of corn pulp in as little water as you can 
without scorching. Put the cobs in a quart of water and boil hard for 
20 mimites ; remove cobs and in this water boil one pint of shelled beans 
until tender; drain and mix with the corn. Add butter the size of a 
walnut, pepper, salt and half a cupful of thick cream, more if liked. 
Serve hot. 

Baked Egg Plant. — Select one that is firm and fresh, peel it and cut 
it into quarters. Let. it lie half an hour in salted water. Put it into boil- 
ing water with a teaspoonful of salt. Cook until it can be easily pierced 



lis THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

with a fork. While the plant is cooking cut one medium-sized onion 
into small pieces and cover it with salt water. In 10 minutes pour off the 
water and put the chopped onion into a hot pan, with a tablespoonful of 
butter. Cook until it is thoroughly tender and brown. Drain the egg 
plant in a colander, put into a bowl, stir with a silver fork until it is 
broken up, but not mashed. Mix with it an equal quantity of rolled 
bread crumbs, add the browned onion and one well-beaten egg. Season 
with a dash of salt, two dashes of pepper, and add a dessertspoonful of 
butter. Put the mixture into a well-buttered earthen dish, bake just 
long enough to be nicely browned. Serve hot in the dish in which it is 
baked. 

Dutch Hutspot. — Boil six carrots with six onions (medium size) one 
hour, or until tender. In another kettle boil six medium-sized potatoes 
until done. Drain all the water from both, put them together, mash them 
well, add one teaspoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful of sugar, one- 
quarter teaspoonful of pepper, one-half cupful of butter and one-half 
cupful of milk or cream. Beat well and serve hot. 

Macaroni and Cheese. — ^The macaroni is first put into boiling salted 
water and cooked tender — a half hour or less — ^then it is drained, and 
rinsed with cold water, and cut in convenient pieces. A buttered pudding 
dish is then filled with alternate layers of the macaroni and chopped or 
grated cheese, perhaps a cupful of the cheese to a quart of the cooked 
macaroni. Season with salt and pepper, fill the dish with milk, and cover 
with bread or cracker crumbs mixed with a little melted butter and bake 
in a moderate oven for nearly an hour, or till the macaroni absorbs most 
of the milk. 

Macaroni, Italian Style. — Four tablespoonfuls of butter, one-half 
pound of macaroni, an onion, parsley, herbs, tomato catsup and spice. 
Put in a pan one tablespoonful each of finely-chopped onion, parsley and 
rosemary; fry in bubbling butter until well browned; add four table- 
spoonfuls of tomato catsup, some mixed spice, four tablespoonfuls of 
butter and one quart of boiling water; put in macaroni broken into 
medium-sized pieces; frequently shake the pan and stew over a slow fire 
until the macaroni is tender. Arrange on a hot dish, pouring the sauce 
over. Sprinkle thickly with grated cheese. 

Okra, Creole Style. — Wash, trim and cut into slices a quart of young, 
tender okra; place in a granite saucepan two teaspoonfuls of butter, a 
medium-sized onion, a medium-sized green pepper, both minced fine; stir 
.over the fire until a golden brown, then add three large tomatoes peeled 
and cut into pieces, three tablespoonfuls of Spanish or some hot pepper 
sauce and salt to taste, and the okra. Cover the saucepan and simmer 
gently for half an hour. Turn out on a hot dish and sprinkle over with 
a teaspoonful of minced parsley and serve. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. U9 

Baked Onions. — Peel and cut in thick slices large white onions. Par- 
boil in plenty of salted water, drain well, arrange in a buttered baking 
dish, dot with bits of butter and bake until soft and a pale yellow. 
Sprinkle with salt and pepper and cover with a half-inch layer of grated 
crumbs thickly dredged with grated cheese. Return to the oven long 
enough to melt the cheese. 

Escalloped Onions. — Slice some onions and cook in salted water until 
done, drain and put layers of onion -and cracker crumbs seasoned with 
salt, pepper and butter in pudding dish; moisten with milk. Bake 20 to 
30 minutes. 

Baked Split Peas. — Rub a large baking dish with onion. Turn into 
this a pint of split peas soaked until soft. Chop a large onion very fine 
and spread over the top of the peas with pepper and salt. If you have 
left over gravy or stock pour it over the mixture. If not, cover with 
water, spreading over all bacon cut into the thinnest possible slices. Bake 
in the oven for two hours and add a little boiling water if the peas get 
too dry. 

French Fried Potatoes. — Old potatoes are better for this, or the little 
yellowish potatoes that German cooks use for potato salad. These con- 
tain more gluten. Peel very thin and cut in long thin strips lengthwise. 
Let them stand in cold salted water for two or three hours. Drain and 
wipe dry; put into a wire basket and fry in very hot, deep fat until brown. 
Take out and lay on a piece of manila paper to absord the fat; dust with 
salt and serve. Another way to fry potatoes is to put a little olive oil in 
a deep frying pan; when very hot add sliced cold boiled potatoes. Cover, 
and cook until a golden brown, turning once. Drain, put in a hot vege- 
table dish and sprinkle with salt, pepper and lemon juice. Still another 
way, that the French chef delights in, is to chop cold boiled potatoes, then 
season lightly with salt, pepper and onion juice. Put a couple of table- 
spoonfuls of olive oil or good drippings in the frying pan, turn in the 
potatoes, press into a solid cake and cook slowly until crusty and brown 
on the under side. Turn on to a hot platter, with the brown side upper- 
most. 

Potatoes au Gratin. — Peel and cut into dice half a dozen potatoes, 
crisp in cold water, then drain, and boil until tender. Drain the water 
off, put the potatoes in a baker, season with pepper and salt, stir a table- 
spoonful of butter through the pieces, pour over them half a cup of milk, 
cover the top with grated cheese, bake quickly and serve hot. 

Potato Chowder. — Wash and pare four large potatoes. Cut them 
into small dice. Chop fine one-quarter of a pound of ham and one good- 
sized onion. Slowly fry the ham and onion together until a light brown, 
then in a saucepan put alternate layers of the ham and diced potato, 
seasoning well with salt and pepper. Add one tablespoonful of finely- 



120 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

chopped parsley and one pint of boiling water, cover and simmer slowly 
until the potatoes are tender, which will take about twenty minutes. In 
a second saucepan thicken two cupfuls of milk with one tablespopnful 
of butter, and one tablespoonful of flour, simmer for a moment, add it 
to the chowder and let cook for two minutes longer. 

Potato Dumplings. — Boil six large potatoes and mash, seasoning with 
one-half teaspoonful salt. Place on a board. Add to this one egg and 
one-half cupful flour; knead into a 'dough. Roll out into strips, one-half 
inch thick, and cut into inch lengths. Sprinkle the pieces with flour, so 
that they are quite dry. Place enough of the dumplings in a saucepan 
of boiling water to allow them freedom to swim, and allow them to boil 
about eight minutes. Remove the dumplings from the water, with a 
perforated spoon, to a hot frying pan, in which one cupful bread crumbs 
have been browned in about two tablespoonfuls butter. All of the dump- 
lings can be placed in the pan at the same time. They should be stirred 
from time to time, until nicely browned, keeping a small fire under the 
pan. Serve hot. 

German Sour Potatoes. — Boil four good-sized potatoes. When done 
and cold, skin and cut into cubes. Place these in a bowl and add salt 
and pepper to taste. Now mix in another bowl half a pint of sweet oil 
and four tablespoonfuls of sweet cider vinegar, one good-sized onion, 
grated fine and sprigs of parsley finely chopped. Mix these together well 
and pour over the potatoes. Now place the empty bowl on top of the 
full one and shake up and down until well mixed. Garnish the dish with 
lemon slices, cut in halves. 

Hashed Brown Potatoes. — Cut or chop finely a quart of cold baked 
or boiled potatoes and put them down in a frying pan in which has been 
dissolved a tablespoonful of butter and an equal quantity of tried-out suet 
or beef dripping. Let the potatoes simmer in this and season with pepper 
and salt; have the pan covered. When the potatoes seem rich and moist 
throughout and browned underneath add a sprinkling of finely-minced 
parsley and with a large, flexible knife loosen the potatoes from the bot- 
tom of the pan, turning the sides over toward the middle as in making 
an omelet, and slip them carefully on to the serving dish. For a pint of 
potatoes use half the quantity of butter and drippings. 

Lyonnaise Potatoes. — Put Vyi tablespoonful of butter in a frying pan; 
when melted add a scant tablespoonful of chopped onion; let it slightly 
color, then add two cupfuls of cold boiled potatoes cut into dice. Stir 
until the potato has absorbed all the butter and become slightly browned; 
then sprinkle with salt, pepper and a tablespoonful of chopped parsley. 
Mix well and serve very hot. 

Scalloped Potatoes. — Peel and slice very thia one medium-sized potato 
for each person to be served, and allow the slices to remain in cold water 



THE RURAL COOk BOOK. 121 

till crisp. Prepare as you would scalloped oysters with cracker crumbs 
and salt and pepper sprinkled over each layer, and small dots of butter. 
Cover the top of the pan with crumbs and carefully pour on sweet milk 
almost to cover without disturbing the cracker crumbs. Bake two hours 
and a half in a steady oven, removing cover from pan during last half 
hour. It is better to use your thickest, heaviest kettle cover or earthen- 
ware pie pan for the first hour in the oven. 

Spaghetti with Brown Sauce. — Put a half pound of spaghetti into 
slightly-salted boiling water. Boil half an hour, drain and pour into a 
buttered granite pan. Pour over it the following brown sauce : Heat 
three tablespoonfuls butter, stir into this two tablespoonfuls flour, stir 
till smooth. Draw to a cooler place on the stove and add gradually one 
cupful cold water, stirring constantly. Let it boil up, add one scant tea- 
spoonful salt, one-fourth teaspoonful pepper, one teaspoonful of catsup, 
simmer two or three minutes, pour over spaghetti, set it into the oven 
and let it bake 10 or 15 minutes. 

Squash Puff. — Press dry cooked squash through a sieve; to a half pint 
add two tablespoons of melted butter, quarter of a cup of milk, seasoning 
of salt and pepper, and two beaten egg yolks. Mix thoroughly, fold in 
two beaten egg whites, and turn into a buttered mold, set in a pan of 
hot water and bake in the oven until the center is iirra. Serve turned 
from the mold and accompanied by a rich cream sauce made from one 
tablespoon each of flour and butter with a cup of scalded cream or rich 
milk and seasoning of salt, pepper, celery salt and mace. This can be 
baked in individual molds if desired. 

Scalloped Squash. — Two cupfuls of boiled squash run through a 
colander, and then let cool ; two eggs, a tablespoonful of melted butter, 
half a cup of milk; pepper and salt; half a cupful of bread crumbs. Beat 
eggs, butter and milk and squash light; season; pour into a buttered bake 
dish, sift crumbs over it and bake, covered, half an hour; then brown 
lightly. 

Stewed Stimmer Squash.^Wash, pare, cut into pieces after removing 
the seeds, cook in a small quantity of water until tender; drain and press 
dry, salt slightly and serve on golden-browned toast with a cream dress- 
ing made as follows : Into half a pint of rich milk stir one teaspoonful 
of cornstarch, let boil until slightly thickened, then pour it over the toast 
and squash. 

Sweet Potato, Southern Style. — Peel and boil until they are thoroughly 
but not too well cooked. Then they should be cut into four pieces length- 
wise and placed in a tin baking pan. Butter and sugar should be placed 
over the potatoes abundantly before they are put in the oven to bake 
slowly. After a while, the butter and sugar mingling with the juice of 
the potatoes, forms a delicate crust that should be cooked until it has 



132 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

almost reached the point at which it is candy. Under this crust is a 
thick, rich syrup of the sap of the potatoes, sugar and butter. 

Stuffed Sweet Potatoes. — Select large, fine potatoes of uniform size. 
Bake them soft, taking care that they do not burn. With a sharp knife 
cut a slit lengthwise in each and scrape out the inside, breaking the skin 
as little as possible. Put the pulp into a bowl; work into it a tablespoon- 
ful of butter, enough hot milk to make a soft paste; salt and pepper to 
taste, and a teaspoonful of lemon juice. Beat light, and fill the emptied 
skins with the mixture. Bring the cut edges neatly together, and set the 
potatoes back in the oven to reheat. Serve in a deep dish lined with a 
heated napkin. 

Baked Tomatoes, Italian Style. — Pour two tablespoonfuls of olive oil 
into a baking dish. Add four tablespoonfuls of grated bread crumbs 
that have already been mixed with parsley and other herbs, all of which 
must have been chopped very fine. Season with pepper and salt. Upon 
this bed of oil and crumbs lay a dozen tomatoes that have been cut in 
halves. Cover them with four more tablespoonfuls of bread crumbs that 
have previously been seasoned in the same way. Pour over all two more 
tablespoonfuls of oil and send the dish to a hot oven, where the tomatoes 
must bake for about one hour. 

Panned Tomatoes. — These are excellent served with roast meats. Put 
in a pan with two ounces of butter six firm tomatoes that have been cut 
in halves. Cook slowly on the top of the range for 10 minutes, then 
brown quickly in the oven. Remove the tomatoes to a hot platter, and 
make a sauce by adding to the browned butter two tablespoonfuls of 
flour, and after it is rubbed smooth one pint of milk. Stir until boiling. 
Season well with salt and pepper and pour over the tomatoes. Garnish 
with parsley and points of toast. 

Scallop of Tomatoes and Potatoes.^ — Season a pint of peeled and 
chopped tomatoes with salt, pepper and onion juice to suit the taste, and 
add enough potatoes to make a cupful when chopped fine. Butter a baking 
dish and sprinkle with bread crumbs and put in half of the tomatoes; 
then a layer of soft crackers, buttered and broken in coarse bits. Cover 
the crackers with two heaping tablespoonfuls of grated American cheese. 
Then add the remainder of the tomatoes, more cracker crumbs and bits 
of butter and place in a hot oven. Bake 30 minutes. Serve at once. 



CHAPTER XI. 

CANNING AND PRESERVING. 

This chapter does not aim to cover the entire ground, but to give 
briefly the experience of other housewives, which may include some in- 
formation not generally found in print. There are still many housewives 
who laboriously can fruit by cooking it in a kettle, and then lifting it 
into the jars; we make preserves in that way, but our canned fruit 
is packed into jars, covered with hot syrup, and then cooked by standing 
the jars in water in a wash boiler. Instead of putting odd pieces of board 
in the bottom of the boiier to rest the jars on, have a board made to fit, 
with three cleats across it underneath and a number of auger holes bored 
in it so that the water passes through. We usually put enough water to 
come half way up the jars, but some housekeepers elevate the jars above 
the water and cover the boiler closely, thus cooking the fruit in the steam. 
Of course there are cooking kettles made for this purpose which are 
more convenient than a wash boiler. 

Fruit is canned without sugar after the following method : Fill the 
jars with fruit; then pour in as much water as they will hold; adjust the 
rubbers ; lay the lids carefully on top without fastening them down ; stand 
the jars in a wash boiler, the bottom of which has been protected with a 
rack; surround them with cold water; put the lid on the boiler; bring to 
boiling point and boil strawberries, blackberries, raspberries and currants 
for twenty minutes; cherries, for three-quarters of an hour; pineapples, 
for half an hour; peaches and pears, for half an hour. Strawberries and 
raspberries are better without water. Fill the jars with fruit, bring them 
to boiling point, and when the fruit shrinks or settles you may fill two 
jars from a third; put them back in the boiler; cook for five or 10 
minutes longer and then fasten on the lids. Seal the jars. Lift the jars 
one at a time and screw on the lids without lifting them. Wipe the jars, 
put them into a cool place out of the draught. Next morning give each 
lid a turn and store in a cool dark place. 

Canned fruit may also be cooked in the oven. Pack the prepared 
fruit in the jars, fill up with hot syrup, and lay the cover on top of the 
jar without fastening. Place in the oven, setting in a dripping-pan holding 
about two inches of water, or on a strip of asbestos. The oven should be 
moderately hot. Cook the fruit 10 or 15 minutes, dependent again upon 
the fruit, then lift from the oven, one can at a time, fill to overflowing 
with the scalding syrup, running the blade of a silver knife around the 
edge of the can to allow for the escape of all air-bubbles, then wipe and 



124 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

screw as tightly as possible. Set the jars on a thickly folded newspaper, 
out of a draft, until the fruit has cooled, then tighten again. 

The following method is highly recommended for small fruits : Look 
over the fruit carefully, using only that which is perfect. Place in glass 
jars, that are also perfect. Shake down the fruit, but do not press down. 
Have ready enough hot syrup to cover the fruit. Fill the can full of the 
syrup, including the fruit already in. Screw on the cover tightly, and 
drop into a pail of boiling water. Be sure that the water is boiling, and 
that it covers the can well. Remove the pail to the table or some other 
convenient place; when the water is cool, take out the can, screw down 
the cover, if it is not tight, label, wrap in brown paper, and put away in 
the fruit cupboard. 

Some firm fruits, and also rhubarb, may be canned without cooking, 
being packed into the bottle, which is then filled with cold water. The 
jar is filled to overflowing, and any air bubbles removed by running the 
blade of a silver knife down the side; it is then sealed tightly and stored 
in a cool dark place. 

Try to avoid beet sugar when making jelly. We have never succeeded 
in hardening a fruit jelly made with beet sugar, and many exasperating 
cases of jelly that won't "jell" are due to this cause. Marian Harland 
says that many years ago she v.'as advised to use one-fifth more beet sugar 
than a recipe called for when cane sugar was used. 

Almack's Preserves.^ — This is a foreign recipe. Peel and stone one 
quart of large ripe plums; peel and slice one dozen apples and one dozen 
pears. Arrange in an earthen jar in alternate layers, adding one pound 
of sugar to each pound of fruit. Set on back of range on an asbestos 
mat and simmer slowly until a little when cooled on ice shows it to be 
of such a firm consistency that it can be cut with a knife, for it is to.be 
served cut in slices. When sufficiently cooked put away in a shallow jar 
from which it will be easy to cut it out. Seal like jelly, with paraffin 
before covering. 

Preserved Ginger. — Clean and wash some fine green ginger roots, let 
thern lie several hours in cold water, drain and place the roots in |a 
kettle of boiling water, cook 30 minutes ; drain and rinse off with oold 
water; return the ginger to the kettle, cover with fresh boiling water and 
cook until the ginger is soft; drain and put in cold water. Next day 
drain the roots in a sieve and weigh them ; allow for each pourid one 
pound of sugar and one-half pint of water; boil sugar and water five 
minutes, add the ginger, boil a few minutes, remove and pour the ginger 
in a bowl. Twelve hours later drain off the syrup, boil it three minutes 
and pour it over the ginger; repeat this twice more. Then drain off all 
the syrup, place over the fire, boil to a soft ball, add the ginger, cook two 
minutes and fill into jars.

Canned Baked Apples. — Select good tart cooking apples; wash, remove 
the blossom end, but do not peel. Arrange in a baking pan with hot 
water to half fill the pan. Sprinkle with sugar, bits of sweet butter, and 
a dash of any spice if desired, and bake until tender. Can while hot, using 
the juice in which they were baked. Stand the jar in hot water 30 
minutes before wanted for use, and you will have perfect baked apples 
for breakfast. Pears canned the same way are fine, or pears with thinly 
sliced quince scattered among them. 

Canned Porter Apples. — Wipe, quarter, core and peel the apples, then 
weigh them. Make a syrup by boiling for 10 minutes one-third the weight 
of the apples in granulated sugar with water, the proportion being zyi 
cupfuls of water to one pound of sugar. Cook the apples slowly in the 
syrup until soft; do not crowd them. Skim out the apples carefully into 
jars, cover with the boiling syrup, and seal. 

Apple Ginger. — Tie a little ginger root in a bag. A quarter of a pound 
will do for eight pounds of apples. Put the bag of ginger into three 
pints of cold, clear water. When the water is highly flavored add about 
three-quarters of a pound of sugar to every pound of apples. The three 
pints of water will be sufficient for six pounds of sugar. Add the juice 
of two lemons, laying aside the yellow peel cut in shreds. Clarify the 
syrup by allowing it to cool after it has cooked five minutes and mixing 
the white of two eggs and the shells in the cooled syrup. Return the 
syrup to the fire, let it boil up once, and then draw to the back of the 
stove. A scum will cover it. Strain into a clean saucepan, add the 
yellow peel of the lemons and put in quarters of apples. As soon as 
cooked, lift them out and put in more. Place the apples into jars and 
pour the syrup over them. 

Apple Orange Marmalade. — Core and slice 30 large tart apples. Allow 
for every quart one pint of water. Add the thin peel of one orange, cover 
and boil until tender. Place a sieve over a bowl, pour in the apples and 
let drain without disturbing. Allow for each pint one pound of sugar. 
Peel four large oranges, remove white part and seeds and set aside. Boil 
apple juice till very thick, add orange cut into small pieces and cook until 
a drop retains its shape on a plate. Put in glass jars and cover like 
jelly. The apple pulp may be used in pies. 

Preserved Apples. — Pare and core fine, ripe pippins, and cut them into 
quarters. Weight and to each pound allow one pound of granulated sugar 
and a half pint of boiling water, the grated rind of one and the juice of 
two lemons. Boil the sugar and water until clear (about three minutes), 
skimming the scum from the ."jurface, add the juice and rind of the lemons, 
then the apples, and simmer gently until they are clear and tender, but 
not broken, then stand aside to cool. When cold, put them into jars, cover 



126 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

closely and stand in a cool, dark place for one week. At the end of that 
time turn them carefully into the kettle, bring them to boiling point, and 
simmer for five minutes, then return them to the jars, cover closely with 
tissue paper brushed over with the white of an egg, and put in a dark, 
cool place to keep. Apples are more difficult to keep than any other fruit. 

Blackberry cheese is an old-fashioned but excellent recipe. Three pounds 
apples, peeled and cored; three pounds blackberries. To each pound pulp 
allow .three-quarters pound sugar. Peel, core and slice the apples, put 
them in a jar with the blackberries, which must be picked over, and let 
them remain in the, oven for three-quarters of an hour, or till the fruit 
is quite soft; pulp through a sieve, and to every pound of pulp allow 
three-quarters of a pound of sugar; boil the pulp for another hour; put 
into jars very hot, and when cold cover in the usual way. It should be 
firm enough to slice when turned out. 

Barberry Jam. — Pick three pounds of barberries from the stalk, put 
them in a jar or farina boiler, with three pounds of sugar. Stand the jar 
in a saucepan of boiling water, and simmer gently until the sugar is 
dissolved and berries soft, then stand aside all night. In the morning 
put them in a porcelain-lined kettle, and simmer slowly for 25 minutes, 
stirring continually. Turn into glasses and seal when cool, like jelly. 

Barberry Preserves. — This is a very old-fashioned recipe. Four quarts 
of barberries picked from the stems, washed and drained. Heat one large 
quart of molasses and one quart of white sugar together until the sugar 
is dissolved. Skim, and then add the barberries. Cook until they begin 
^o pop and shrivel, which will be in about 10 minutes. Skim them into a 
stone jar, then boil the syrup slowly until it will cover the berries. 

Bar le Due Preserves. — Take selected red (or white) currants of large 
size, one by one, carefully make an incision in the skin, one-fourth an 
inch in size, with tiny embroidery scissors. Through this slit, with a 
sharp needle, remove the seeds, separately, preserving the shape of the 
fruit. Take the weight of the currants in strained honey and, when hot, 
add the currants. Let simmer a minute or two, then seal as jelly. The 
currants retain their shape, are of a beautiful color and melt in the 
mouth. Should the currants liquefy the honey too much, carefully skim 
them out, reduce the syfup at a gentle simmer to desired consistency and 
store as before after adding the fruit. 

Black Currants. — Gather the currants on a dry day; to every pound 
allow half a pint red currant juice and a pound and a half of finely 
pounded loaf sugar. Clip off the heads and stalks; put the juice, currants 
and sugar in a preserving pan; shake it frequently till it boils; carefully 
remove the fruit from the sides of the pan, and take off the scum as it 
rises; let it boil for 10 or 15 minutes. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 137 

Blueberry Mixtures. — A combination of blueberries and gooseberries, 
one portion of gooseberries to three of the blueberries, canned in the 
ordinary fashion, makes an excellent Winter sauce or filling for pies. So 
does a combination of blueberries and rhubarb, one cupful of rhubarb 
and one cupful of sugar to a quart of blueberries. 

Cherry Conserve. — Five quarts cherries (sour), one pound raisins 
(seeded and cut) ; ivto oranges (pulp cut in pieces, also yellow of skin) ; 
one pound English walnuts (chopped) ; a;-^ pounds sugar. Cook until 
thick and put in jelly tumblers. Cherries must be boiled about 20 minutes 
before putting in sugar, etc. 

Cherry Conserve No. 2. — Three pounds sour cherries; two pounds 
raisins; four pounds granulated sugar; four large oranges. Seed and 
steam the raisins for half an hour. Grate some of the orange peel in the 
cherries. Do not use the orange skin. Cut the pulp into small pieces. 
Mix all the ingredients together, boil for 20 minutes, put in glasses.' ^ 

Cherry Preserve, Sun-cooked. — Pit the cherries, which must be perfect 
ripe fruit, weigh, and put in a preserving kettle, allowing three-quarters of 
a pound of sugar to each pound of fruit. Do not add any water; the 
juice and sugar make the syrup. Bring to a boil, and boil for 20 minutes, 
stirring to avoid burning and skimming to keep clear. Skim out the 
fruit, putting on shallow^ platters, pour the syrup over, and cover with 
clean panes of glass. Put the platters out in the sun, and keep outdoors 
three days, bringing in at night. Then put in jars, like any other pre- 
serve. The sun cooks the syrup to a honey-like consistence, and the flavor 
is delicious. Strawberries cooked the same way have all the rich frag- 
rance of the fresh fruit. 

Citron Preserves. — Pare and core the citron, cut into strips and notch 
the edges, or cut into fancy shapes. Allow a pound of sugar to a pound 
of fruit, and to six pounds of the fruit allow four lemons and a quarter 
of a pound of ginger root. Tie the ginger root in a cloth and boil it in a 
quart and a half of water until the flavor is extracted ; then remove it and 
add to the water the sugar and the juice of the lemons. Stir until the 
sugar is dissolved and the syrup is clear, remove any scum that may form, 
then add the citron and cook until it is clear, but not soft enough to fall 
apart; can and seal while hot. 

Citron Preserves No. 2. — ^Cut the citron in strips half an inch wide, 
pare off the rind as thin as possible and cut up the fruit in small squares.. 
Put in a vessel and cover the fruit with water in which has been dis- 
solved an ounce of alum to the gallon of water. Soak 24 hours, or until 
the citron is clarified. Take out of alum water and soak in clear water 
until the alum is all out, which will probably be in 12 hours. Weigh and 
allow to each pound of fruit a pound of sugar. Put the fruit in a pre- 
serving kettle with only a little sugar, adding sugar several times until 



128 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

the weighed amount has been used. Season with any flavoring preferred. 
Cook rapidly until done, put in glass cans and seal. 

Citron Preserves No. 3. — Pare a large citron, cut into thin slices, and 
then into strips or squares, removing all seeds. Weigh equal quantities of 
fruit and sugar, mix together, and stand over night in a large bowl; the 
sugar draws out juice, forming a syrup. In the morning put in a pre- 
serving kettle, and boil slowly for two to three hours, skimming carefully, 
until the syrup is like honey. About 15 minutes before taking from the 
stove add, for each quart of preserves, one lemon cut in very thin slices, 
and one small piece of green ginger root. Some housekeepers add a few 
whole cloves, but we do not care for this. Another method puts the 
sliced fruit to soak in brine for a few hours, then in clear water to freshen 
it, this process hardening the fruit, but we have never used this process, 
and are quite satisfied with the first recipe given. 

Dried Citron. — To prepare citron for cakes and pies cut the fruit in 
four parts, pare and remove the seeds; then take a couple of quarts of 
clear water, dissolve a piece of alum the size of a hickorynut in the 
water, put in the preserving kettle as much citron as the water will cover 
and boil until tender enough to pierce with a straw; then boil in sugar; 
a pint bowl of sugar to the same measure of fruit. Boil one-half hour. 
Spread it on pie plates and set it in a cool oven or heater and let it dry 
perfectly; 

Preserved Crab Apples. — The apples should be very ripe. Wash them 
well in cold water; put them into a porcelain-lined kettle and just cover 
with boiling water. Let them cook very gently until you can remove the 
skins easily. Drain them, peel and carefully remove the cores, but do nc5t 
break the apples or remove the stems. Weigh them, allowing one and 
one-quarter pound of sugar to a pound of fruit; allow a cupful of water 
to this quantity of. sugar. Put water and sugar over the fire and bring to 
boiling point. Skim until clear, then put in the apples and cook very 
gently until they are tender and transparent. Skim while cooking. When 
they are done put them into small, large-mouthed jars, and when cool 
seal same as jelly. 

Currants, Canning. — Wash the currants, being careful not to break f.. 
them; remove stems, and pack currants into quart cans, shaking them 
down well. To each can add one cup hot sugar, place the jars on a 
wooden frame in the boiler, place the covers loosely on the cans, and put 
enough of cold water in the boiler, so when it begins to boil it will not 
boil into the cans. After the water has boiled for half an hour, the cans 
should be lifted out, the covers screwed on tight and put in a cool, dark 
place until wanted for the table. For those that like mixed fruits, a layer 
of strawberries or raspberries and then a layer of currants may be packed 
in the cans. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 129 

Currant Conserve. — Five pounds currants; four pounds sugar; one 
pound seeded raisins ; four oranges. Grate rind and squeeze out juice of 
oranges. Boil all together half hour. Put in jelly glasses. 

Currant Sauce. — Five pounds of currants, heat in preserving kettle, put 
in a muslin bag and squeeze out all juice. Add five pounds granulated 
sugar, one pound raisins, seeded and chopped fine, two oranges, chopped 
fine. Boil till like jelly. The sender of this recipe does up currants with- 
out cooking. Occasionally she says a can spoils, but on the whole she has 
good luck, every can keeping perfectly some years. The currants are 
looked over carefully, washed and then mashed thoroughly, a glass bottle 
being good for this purpose. She then adds sugar, pound for pound. The 
fruit is sealed in cans, using new rubbers each time. Pineapples are also 
put up in somewhat the same way. Mrs. C.'s way is to chop the fruit 
fine, add sugar pound for pound. The fruit thus prepared is left in a 
gallon crock for two days, its contents being stirred frequently with a 
silver spoon. At the end of the second day the fruit is put in air- 
tight cans. 

Cranberry asd Apple Jam. — Take two pounds of cranberries and two 
pounds of apples after they are peeled, cored and chopped. Put them in 
a preserving pan with 3^2 pounds of sugar. When it comes to the boil 
keep the preserve boiling for half an hour, then try a little on a cold 
•saucer, and if on cooling it sets well it will be sufficiently done. Tie down 
in small jars. This makes a delicious preserve, the cranberries imparting 
a fine flavor and giving in addition a brilliant color. 

Damson Cheese. — Boil the fruit, with only enough water to prevent 
burning, until tender; rub through a hair sieve until like a paste, add six 
ounces of sugar to each pound of fruit, stir off the fire until the sugar is 
dissolved, then add four chopped kernels from the fruit to each quart, and 
put back to boil. It is wise to put an asbestos mat under the preserving 
kettle, as the fruit will catch and burn very easily. Boil, stirring con- 
tinually, until the preserve will leave the pan quite dry and adhere in a 
mass to the spoon. Press into jelly glasses, and when cold cover with 
paraffin before sealing. When served, the damson cheese is turned out 
of the glass, and cut in thin slices. 

Elderberries. — These may be combined with gooseberries, crab apples 
and green grapes, equal parts of either, making a piquant table sauce, 
while pies made from them might please the individual who does not 
care for the flavor of the single fruit. For Winter use elderberries may 
be preserved in either of the above combinations and treated as other fruit, 
or canned plain without sugar for use in pies only. When making pies 
from the plain canned fruit it is wise to cook the berries with the same 
proportion of sugar, flour, etc., as given for fresh berries, filling the pie 
paste when cold. This insures a jelly-like consistency of the finished 



130 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

product without those unpalatable doughy lumps too often seen. Again 
they may be spiced and used as a table sauce or in pies, using the same 
proportion. 

Pickled Elderberries for Pies.— Seven pounds elderberries, stemmed, 
four pounds sugar, one pint vinegar, two tablespoonfuls cinnamon, one 
tablespoon cloves. Boil until the juice is rather thick. They will keep 
in an open jar. 

Preserved Elderberries. — Seven pounds of elderberries, three pounds of 
granulated sugar, three lemons sliced thin; put the elderberries alone in a 
stone jar in warm salt and water ovef night. Next morning drain them 
in a colander, make syrup of the sugar and lemons and one pint of water, 
then put elderberries in the syrup and cook. When they begin to boil 
hard time them 20 minutes, then pour in a jar or can ready for use. 

Preserved Elderberries No. 2. — Shell berries. To an eight-quart panful 
use a heaping tablespoon of salt, pour on hot water and let stand half 
an hour; drain well. To seven pounds of berries thus prepared, use three 
pounds of sugar and one pint of vinegar; boil well. If one wish to keep 
in jars without sealing they should be boiled down thoroughly. For pies 
add a little sugar and flour enough slightly to thicken the juice. 

Spiced Elderberries.' — Nine pounds cleaned elderberries, three pounds 
brown sugar, one pint vinegar and one ounce each of cloves, cinnamon 
and allspice. Put sugar and vinegar in a two-gallon granite kettle over 
a slow fire and let come to a boil. Add berries and let simmer two and a 
half hours. Tie spices in little muslin bags and add when nearly done. 
Seal in air-tight cans. 

Preserved Figs.— Take fresh, ripe figs, cut off half the stem of each 
and let soak all night in very weak brine, using two tablespoonfuls of 
salt to each quart of water. In the morning drain and cover with fresh 
water. Make a thick syrup, allowing three-quarters of a pound of sugar 
to each pound of fruit, and one-half cupful of water to each pound of 
sugar. Simmer for a few minutes until the syrup is clear, then drain 
and lay in it the freshened figs and simmer slowly until they look clear. 
Into each jar drop a half-inch piece of green ginger and the kernels of 
half a dozen peach stones, fill with fruit and syrup and seal. They should 
not be used for at least three months. 

Garfield Butter. — Use two-thirds plums and one-third peaches. Stone 
the plums and pare and stone the peaches. Mash and heat slowly to boil- 
ing, boil until soft, then rub through a sieve. Measure the pulp thus 
obtained and to one measure of fruit add three-quarters of a measure 
of sugar. Boil until thick, stirring continually, then put into jars and seal. 

Canned Grapes. — After picking ripe grapes from the stem, wash them. 
Remove the skins, keeping them and the pulps separate. Cook the pulps 
until the seeds begin to separate. Run through a colander or coarse sieve 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 131 

to remove the seeds. Add the skins to the pulp, cooking till tender. Allow 
one-half pound of sugar to each pound of fruit. 

Gooseberries with Currant Juice. — The tops and tails being removed 
from the gooseberries, allow an equal quantity of finely-pounded loaf sugar 
and put a layer of each alternately into a large, deep jar; pour into it as 
much dripped red currant juice as will dissolve the sugar, adding its 
weight in sugar. The next day put all in a preserving pan, boil it, and 
put up as other jams. 

Grape Marmalade. — Choose ripe grapes of any familiar kind, and place 
them in the preserving kettle with just enough water to prevent their 
burning. Cook slowly at the side of the stove until they are well broken 
and mashed. Then press through a sieve and measure the pulp. For 
each pint allow half a pound of sugar. Place the grape pulp over the 
fire, boil for 30 minutes, add the sugar and boil from 10 to 20 minutes 
longer, or until a drop of the mixture when put on a plate will retain its 
shape without spreading. Stir constantly while cooking. Skim carefully 
from time to time and when done pack in small jars. 

Grape and Apple Marmalade. — Many people do not care for the flavor 
of the Clinton grape, but it is excellent to use with sweet apples in mar- 
malade, following a New England recipe, in which the wild frost grape is 
ordinarily used. Heat four pounds of stemmed and pulped grapes until 
the seeds are free of pulp. Have four pounds of sweet apples pared, cored, 
sliced and steamed until tender. Sift the grape pulp, add the apples, turn 
into a kettle set on asbestos mat or back of range and simmer slowly for 
two hours ; measure, add sugar in the proportion of three-quarters of a 
pound to a pint of pulp, and cook until a little, chilled on ice, shows that 
it is stiff enough to retain its shape. Turn into jelly glassei and seal. 

Grape Preserves. — Press the pulp out of each grape; boil the pulps 
until tender, then press through colander to remove the seeds ; mix the 
skins with the pulp and juice; add as many cupfuls of sugar as there are 
of grapes and boil together until thickened. Green grapes are preserved 
by cutting each grape in halves, taking out the seeds, then adding an equal 
quantity of sugar and boiling all together until the right consistency; seal 
while hot. 

Spiced Grapes. — Press the skins from the grapes and put the pulp 
through the colander; add the skins and weigh. To every pound of 
grapes add one cupful of vinegar, two ounces of powdered cinnamon, one 
ounce of powdered cloves and three and a half pounds of sugar; boil an 
hour and a half until thick, then bottle. Small Damson plums are very 
nice prepared in the same way. 

Marmalades. — One simple process will serve for all kinds of marma- 
lade, and that is to cook the fruit in its own juice to a state of collapse. 
Then press through a colander, measure, bring to a boil, and skim, before 



132 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

adding the sugar — measure for measure. Cook with care after the sugar 
scum begins to thicken. When the juice rolls up a jelly on a cold silver 
spoon, the marmalade is ready for pint can, or for glasses, covered when 
cold with one-foui-th inch, at the least, of hot paraffin. All the small fruits 
make delicious marmalades when pressed through a fine colander or sieve 
to remove the seeds. Grapes and blackberries do not require full measure 
for measure of sugar. Plums are easily converted into a palatable mar- 
malade after removing the pits, but they are more easily made into pre- 
serves, the same as peaches, and quinces ; both are too good for marma- 
lades. By the following method clingstone peaches can be utilized, also 
imperfect pears and quinces. Pare the peaches and cut into pieces a.s 
small as a cherry, pack into a measuring dish and note the amount. Add 
water to prevent burning and cook thoroughly before adding the sugar — 
measure for measure. Boil with care the same as for marmalade, and 
place in airtight cans. 

Pineapple Marmalade. — Use thoroughly ripe pineapples, peel them, and 
after removing the hard core, chop them. To each pound of fruit and 
juice, add a pound of sugar, and simmer one hour. Frequent skimming 
and stirring will be necessary. Cool some of it, and if not thick enough, 
continue the boiling half an hour longer. An asbestos cover slipped under 
the kettle is a safeguard against scorching. Crab-apple and plum marma- 
lade is excellent. Use the Siberian crab-apples and Bradshaw or other 
violet red plums. Allow two parts apples to one part plums. Wash the 
fruit and cut out the imperfections. Simmer both kinds until soft, then 
rub through a sieve. Allow a pound of sugar to each pint of fruit puip. 
Put the sugar in the oven to heat, and cook the fruit 20 minutes in a 
porcelain-lined or agate kettle. Add the hot sugar, skim, and cook 30 
minutes longer. Stir very often. 

Peach Marmalade. — Use firm; late peaches. Peel the peaches and cut 
them in halves. Crack two-thirds of the kernels, blanch them, and cut 
into lengthwise strips. Put the peaches over the fire with three-fourths 
of a pound of sugar to each pound of fruit. Stir frequently and cook 
from 20 minutes to half an hour. Five minutes before removing from 
the fire add the blanched kernels. 

Quince Marmalade. — Rub the fruit with a cloth, cut out the flower end, 
and chop without removing the skins and cores. Cook until soft enough 
to rub through a sieve. Strain the fruit and add three-quarters pound of 
sugar to a pound of fruit. Cook slowly until done, which should be in 
15 or 20 minutes. Apple marmalade affords a change from cider apple 
sauce and stewed apples. Take seven pounds of apples (Fall Pippins are 
nice) and stew them with a pint of water. Put them through a sieve, 
add three-quarters pound of sugar to a pound of pulp, also the juice 
and grated yellow rind of three lemons. Boil half hour, then add a little 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 133 

ginger root. This may be made of one-third quince and two-thirds apples, 
leaving out the ginger and lemons. 

Mixed Marmalade. — Take equal quantities of peaches, apples, pears 
and quinces that have been pared, cored and cut in eighths. Cook quinces 
in water to cover until almost tender. Drain and measure the water. 
For six pounds of mixed fruit there should be one pint of water. Add 
quinces to the other fruit, place in preserve kettle with water, and let 
them cook thoroughly, but not burn. Take out and mash well together. 
Measure. Clean the kettle and put them back with half their weight in 
granulated sugar. Let ihem cook very slowly two hours. Keep them 
stirred well from the bottom and protect with an asbestos mat or set the 
kettle in another containing boiling water, as on no account must the jam 
burn. Seal in small jars. 

Orange and Apple Marmalade. — Cut the apples in small pieces with- 
out peeling them and add a pint of water for every quart of applos. Boil 
them down for half an hour and strain through a sieve. Add the juice 
and pulp of three oranges and a little of the yellow peel cut fine to every 
pmt of apple pulp. To each pint of the mixture, add three-fourths of a 
pound of sugar. Boil the marmalade until it curls before the finger when 
it is cooled for trial. 

Preserved Melon Rind. — Pare the melon very thin ; do not pare away 
all the ripened melon. Leave about one-quarter inch attached to the rind. 
Cut in pieces and place in a crock over night with salt sprinkled between 
the layers. In the morning drain, pour boiling water over, leave for 
one-half hour, drain again. Now weigh the fruit — to 10 pounds fruit add 
five pounds granulated sugar, one-half gallon white vinegar, one ounce 
stick ciimamon, one ounce white ginger root, and one-half ounce whole 
cloves. Tie tbe spice in small muslin bags, place all in a large pan and 
boil slowly. The longer it boils the nicer will it be. 

Milk, Canning. — A correspondent tells us she has canned milk in this 
way and kept it a year : Allow the milk to become perfectly cold, then 
fill sterilized fruit jars to within a half inch of the top; put on the 
covers loosely and set into a clean boiler on a board with holes through ; 
fill boiler with cold water to within an inch of the tops of the jars; bring 
the water to the boiling point and allow it to boil 20 minutes after ebulli- 
tion begins, then remove the cans one by one, put on new rubbers, fill 
with boiling nylk, screw the covers on and invert the. cans till cold. Put 
away in a cool, dark place and use when the cows have dried up. Of 
course this will taste like scalded milk, but for all purposes except drink- 
ing it is ill right. As the cream does not dry, it can readily be mixed 
with the milk if desired. If directions are followed carefully and every- 
thing used made perfectly clean little or none will spoil. It is quite 



134 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

essential to use new rubber rings, as old ones become hard and will not 
make the jars tight. 

Or-ra-cur. — Five pounds of currants, five pounds- of sugar, juice and 
grated rinds of three oranges, one pound of raisins, chopped and stoned; 
boil all together for 20 minutes, and put away in jelly glasses. 

Peach Butter. — This is a nice way to use up peaches that are too ripe 
for canning or pickling. Pare ripe peaches, put in a kettle with sufficient 
water to cover peaches ; when soft run through a colander, the stones 
being thus easily removed. To each quart of peaches thus prepared add 
1J4 pound of granulated sugar. Boil slowly till thick; add ground cinna- 
mon to taste. This, like all butters and marmalades, requires constant 
watching to keep the fruit from burning. 

Spiced Peaches. — Weigh eight pounds of freestone peaches after they 
have been peeled, halved and the stones taken out. Put peaches in a por- 
celain lined kettle with one pint of vinegar and five pounds of sugar 
(granulated). Mix one ounce each of cinnamon sticks, whole mace 
and green ginger and one-half ounce of whole cloves. Divide into eight 
parts, tie each in a piece of cheesecloth and drop in the kettle with the 
peaches. ■ Simmer until the fruit is tender, then lift it with a skimmer 
and put it in sterilized jars. Boil the syrup a minute, skim, lift out the 
bags, then pcur over the fruit in the jars. It is an improvement to break 
IS peach stones, blanch the kernels in boiling water and add them to 
the syrup just before pouring it into the jars. 

Peach Jam.^Pare, stone and cut into thin slices half a peck of free- 
stone peaches. Weigh. To each pound of fruit add three-quarters of a 
"pound of granulated sugar. Put in layers in a preserve kettle and let 
them cook gently until clear, which will probably take an hour. Have 
ready cracked one-third the peach stones, remove and blanch the kernels, 
then slice them thin and sprinkle them among the layers of peaches so all 
can cook together. Put into small glass jars or tumblers when cold. 
Shut up air-tight. 

Peach Leather. — Pare fully ripe peaches (yellow ones • preferred) ; 
remove the pits and weigh. To each pound of fruit add one-fourth pound 
of granulated sugar. Put in stew kettle and cook slowly, mashing the 
fruit as it boils. When cooked to a thick paste spread on a buttered 
board and put in the sun to dry. Put out the second day and when dry 
enough that it will not stick, loll up like a roll of leather and keep in a 
cool, dry place. Slice from the end of the roll. 

Pears in Cider. — One of our friends reports that Kieflfer pears are 
delicious' canned in sweet cider. The customary syrup is made by melt ' 
ing sugar in the cider, and the pears are cooked in this (not over-cooked) 
either in the jars or in a kettle. The cider is said to give much richness 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 135 

of flavor. Pears were also canned in perry (pear cider), but the result 
was not considered so desirable as where the apple juice was used. 

Pear Chips. — Four pounds of Duchess or other hard pears sliced thin, 
four pounds of sugar, the juice of three lemons and grated rind of one, 
one ounce of dry or green ginger root chopped fine and one-half tumbler 
of water. Cook until clear, then seal in jelly glasses. 

Pear Syrup. — Very nice syrup may be made from pears, core and 
pare them; cover with cold water and set on back of stove, let simmer 
until soft, then dip off juice carefully or strain through a colander. If 
the juice is not clear strain through a fine strainer. Return to the fire 
and boil down rapidly to about one-quarter, then add sugar, about as for 
jelly, a cupful of sugar to a cupful of juice. Boil until the syrup is thick 
as you wish and put in glass jars. This, when properly made, is thought 
to be as nice as maple syrup. The flavor may be varied a little by using 
a very little lemon juice or green ginger. If desirable, the cooked pears 
may be used by boiling them a short time with a little sugar, or with 
sugar and vinegar. 

Persimmon Figs. — Gather them, and press each fruit between thumb 
and finger, and put in layers in an open-mouthed jar with a thin layer of 
sugar between the layers of fruit and sugar on the top. After a few 
weeks, say three or four, lay on a platter or plate in single layers and 
dry in a very cool oven or in the sun. 

Canned Plums Without Cooking. — This recipe comes from the plum 
belt of central New York, and will be found very satisfactory: Take 
enough large yellow egg plums to fill a quart can. Put them into a 
granite or earthen pan and pour boiling water over them, let stand three 
minutes, then drain. Pour over more boiling water, which will crack 
the skins. Remove the skins, and place the plums carefully in a hot 
sterilized glass jar. Have ready a thick syrup made by boiling two 
cupfuls of granulated sugar that has been moistened with water, and 
cooked to the "brittle stage." Pour the boiling syrup over the plums and 
seal. The syrup will form like "icicles," but after a day or two will 
dissolve. Make enough syrup for two or three cans at once, as it is 
hard to tell just how much it will take to fill a can. They always keep 
perfectly, and retain their flavor much better than when cooked, but the 
secret is in having everything boiling hot. 

Plum Cheese. — For economy make this on the same day you make 
plum jelly. After extracting the jelly juice pass the remaining pulp 
through a colander to remove skins and pits, then weigh. Add a pound 
of sugar to every two pounds of plums and boil one-half an hour ; seal up. 

Plums in Cold Water. — A housekeeper who has had experience with 
the cold-water process of keeping fruit says she has kept wild plums 
all Winter in this way, putting them in a large stone jar and covering 



136 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

them with enough cold water to leave about four inches over them. A 
saucer or plate with a weight on it must be placed o^ top of the fruit 
to keep the top layers deep enough under the water. To make sauce 
from wild plums kept in this way, take out as many of the fruit as ara 
required, and parboil until the skins crack in water containing a pinch 
of baking soda. Then rinse well in clear cold water, drop into boiling 
syrup, and cook until done. This makes a delicious sauce; the parboiling 
with the soda takes the "pucker" out of the fruit. Cratiberries will keep 
for months if covered with cold water as described, and many house- 
keepers put up green currants and gooseberries, also rhubarb, in the same 
way. 

Plum Conserve. — Five pounds plums, peeled and pitted; five pounds 
sugar; cook plums 30 minutes before adding sugar. Put in sugar and 
boil a little, then add two pounds seeded raisins (cut into small pieces), 
grated rind of four oranges and the pulp chipped (easier to cut with 
scissors). Cook to a thick conserve (15 to 30 minutes), and put in jelly 
glasses. Cherries (sour) are good used instead of plums; pit them. 
Currants may also be used instead of plums. 

Pineapple and Plum Jam. — Twelve pounds of large plums, five large 
pineapples, one quart of water and sugar in the proportion of three- 
quarters of a pound to every pound of fruit, and one pound to every pint 
of water. Peel and pit the plums, add the water, bring to the boiling 
point, add the pineapple cut in dice and boil until soft and thick, then 
add the sugar and cook three-quarters of an hour longer. 

.Spiced Plums. — Spiced plums are the best of relishes with game, poul 
try, and mutton. Wash, drain, pick and weigh the plums, prick the skins 
lightly, then pack them down in earthen jars with one-half their own 
weigh of sugar. Strew through the fruit while packing plenty of whole 
cloves, whole allspice, mace, ginger slightly bruised and stick cinnamon. 
Put in also a few whole black peppercorns, and to each jar allot a single 
pod of the small red pepper. Take h"alf a pint of cider vinegar for each 
pound of fruit, add to it as much sugar as the fruit was packed in, bring 
to a boil, skim well and pour over it scalding hot. Let stand 34 hours, 
then drain off the syrup, boil up, skim and return to the fruit. Do this 
three times, then put fruit and syrup together in the kettle, let them boil 
five minutes, skimming well, fill jars and cover. 

Canned Pumpkin. — This will supply pie material when stored pump- 
kins, are gone. Cook the pumpkin and strain it, just as you do for pies, 
being careful not to have much water in it. Fill the can full. Shake 
down so as to have them solid. Put on the tops, screw down just a 
little, so you can lift by them, place in boiler, with something between 
the cans and boiler on the bottom, fill to the neck of cans with water 
and boil one good hour. Take out and wipe the necks of the cans, and 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 137 

if the pumpkin lias slirunlc away, fill cans up with boiling water, put on 
r<ngs and screw down the tops tight, and the pumpkin will keep six 
months in a good, cool place. 

Quince Butter. — Use half a gallon of quinces pared and cored, half 
a gallon of tart apples pared and cored, two quarts of sweet cider, one 
pint of cold water. Cover the crock and stew gently until the fruit is 
very soft; then p^ss through a sieve. Add five cupfuls of sugar and 
cook until soft. 

Canned Quinces. — Prepare the quinces by paring, coring and quarter- 
ing. Use a silver knife. Keep the prepared quinces in cold water to 
prevent them from discoloring until sufficient have been prepared. Cook 
the quinces in boiling water slowly till tender. Have ready a syrup of 
one-half pound of sugar and a pint of water to each pound of fruit. Put 
the cooked quinces in the syrup, allowing them to remain five minutes. 
Then can and seal while hot. 

Quince Honey. — One medium quince and one cupful of granulated 
sugar will make one jelly glass of honey. Pare and grate the quinces, 
then stir this grated pulp into a boiling syrup made of the sugar and 
enough water to dissolve it. Stir slowly and quite often until the pulp 
will remain suspended through the syrup. One should not get it too 
stiff. Put into jelly glasses, and when cool cover in the same way you 
do preserves and jellies, and keep in the preserve closet. 

Quince Jam. — Take one pint of quince juice left from preserves, add 
one pound of sliced apples, three-q.uarters of a pound of sugar; boil two 
hours, stirring well ; pour into glasses while hot and seal. 

Quince and Pear Sauce. — Three pounds light brown sugar, six pounds 
pears, quartered if large, small ones cut in halves; nine pounds quinces, 
quartered. Boil sugar, pears and quinces nearly all day, taking care not 
to let them cook too rapidly, until both pears and quinces are of a rich 
red, and the juice an amber syrup. Can and seal tight. The fruit keeps 
its shape, the pears having gained a fine flavor from the quinces, and the 
quinces having an added goodness from the pears. 

Raisine Bourgognc. — Stem and seed two pounds of ripe grapes. Boil 
with one cup of water until soft. Press through a sieve and add two 
pounds of ripe pears, peeled and sliced; cook until reduced to half the 
amount. Weigh and add an equal amount of sugar, stir until the sugar 
is dissolved, strain again, put in small earthen jars, set in a plate-warm- 
ing oven for a "day or until firm to the touch. Tie down and keep in a 
cool place. 

Raspberry and Currant Bar-le-Duc— To four pounds of raspberries 
add one pound of currants; bruise the currants and strain the juice; add 
to it three-quarters of a pound of sugar to each pound of juice, including 
the weight of the berries left whole. Boil 30 minutes and skim, add the 



138 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

raspberries, cook 20 minutes more. When the syrup jellies on a plate, 
take off and place in glasses or small jars while hot. 

Canned Raspberries. — (Mrs. Mapes's recipe). — First make a syrup by 
boiling seven pounds granulated sugar in 2J4 quarts water. Fill cans with 
fresh berries, putting in as many as possible without crushing the berries. 
Apply covers without the rubbers, and set in a kettle or boiler of cold 
water, so the water comes about two-thirds of the height of the cans. 
Bring to a boil and cook seven to 10 minutes- after boiling begins. Now 
take the cans out of the water, remove the covers, fill with hot syrup 
brimming full, and seal up tight in the usual way. 

Uncooked Canned Rhubarb. — Wash, peel, cut into inch cubes' and 
fill compactly into glass jar, then pour slowly into the jar good fresh 
water to overflowing. Adjust rubber, screw on the top and set away in 
a cool place until morning. Then if there be any air bubbles, tap the 
side of the jar, fill again to the brim with water and screw on cover 
tightly. If tops and rubbers are perfect the rhubarb will keep until used. 

Canned Rhubarb. — Wash it, cut into inch pieces, put in a preserving 
kettle, and let it come to a good boil all through, without a particle 
of sugar. It will keep perfectly. When you wish to open it for use, 
take one cupful of sugar for a pie, and it will be like the fresh pie plant. 
Por a small family, the pint cans are much better for any fruit. 

Rhubarb Jam with Ginger. — String some rhubarb, cut into short 
lengths, and weigh. Put into s kettle and add just enough water to pre- 
vent burning. When it has become quite soft, add sugar, one pound for 
each pound of rhubarb. Stir well until the jam becomes rich and syrupy. 
For each pound take about a teaspoonful of ground ginger, rub it smooth 
with a little water, and add it to your jam. Boil up jam again, stirring 
well; put into glasses, and when cold cover. If a large amount of rhu- 
barb is at command, a high grade of brown sugar is very good; the only 
difference seems to be that the jam is not quite so clear. 

Rhubarb Jelly. — Make when the rhubarb is tender, using the pink 
variety without peeling it, as much of the flavor and all of the color is 
in the skin. Cook eight pounds of rhubarb with the yellow part of thii 
peel from three lemons, in a covered dish, until all the juice of the rhu- 
barb is free. Strain, and add all the juice that can be extracted from 
the three lemons. Boil half an hour and strain through a bag. To- 
each cupful of this juice add a cup and a quarter of granulated sugar, 
which should be heated before putting into the juice. Stir until the 
sugar is entirely dissolved, then boil without stirring until it jellies when 
tested. A fine jelly which may be made later in the season has three- 
fourths of a pound of tart apples (peeled and cored) cut and cooked 
with each pound of rhubarb. Cook until soft and drain through bag 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 139 

without pressing. Allow a cup of vinegar to each cup of juice and 
proceed as in former recipe. 

Rhubarb and Orange Jam.— To a quart of cut up rhubarb, add, half 
a dozen oranges, peeled, cut up and with the pits removed, and a pound 
and a half of sugar. Boil gently until a little set on a plate will jelly. 
This can be varied by slicing the peel of three oranges in thin strips and 
adding it to the fruit. This jam will also keep indefinitely in earthen 
jars, or jelly glasses which have been sealed with paraffin. 

■Rhubarb and Pineapple. — The following rule for canning is a decided 
improvement upon pineapple alone, and the rhubarb taste disappears. 
Chop and cook equal parts of pineapple and rhubarb, and add a cupful 
of sugar for each pint jar. 

Rhubarb Marmalade. — Peel the rhubarb, and cut into pieces one-half 
inch long. Put into a large earthen bowl, and cover with sugar in the 
proportion of one pound of sugar to one quart of rhubarb. Allow this to 
stand over night,_ or 15 to IS hours. Be sure that the bowl is amply 
large, as there will be a flood of juice by morning. Strain off the juice 
and sugar into a preserving kettle; when it begins to boil, add the rhu- 
barb. Boil slowly for an hour, or until the preserve assumes a deep 
red color, stirring carefully to prevent burning, and removing any scum 
that rises to the top. About 15 or 20 minutes before removing from the 
fire, peel the yellow rind from one lemon, chop it fine, and add to the 
preserve, together with the juice of two lemons, this being our usual 
proportion to about four or five quarts of preserve, but the quantity of 
lemon may be varied to suit the taste. This gives a piquant flavor other- 
wise lacking, in spite of the acidity of the rhubarb. When bottled, keep 
in a cool, dark place. This rhubarb jam is very nice in open tarts, or as 
a filling for boiled roly puddings. 

Rhubarb and Almond Marmalade.— Cut rhubarb up very fine, and to 
each cupful add the pulp and juice of one orange, one teaspoonful of the 
grated yellow of the rind, one tablespoonful lemon juice and one and one- 
half cup of sugar. Let stand until the sugar is dissolved, boil rapidly 
until transparent, then add one-half cup of blanched almonds cut in 
thin slices, boil up once and put in glasses. 

• Hackensack Rhubarb Marmalade.— Cut a pound and a half of rhubarb 
into inch lengths and put it in an earthen dish. Scatter over this a 
quarter of a pound of figs and an ounce of candied peel (both cut fine) ; 
over all sprinkle a pound and a quarter of sugar and let stand over 
night. In the morning boil for about 15 minutes, then add a pound 
of either orange or lemon pulp, cut fine, and cook until heavy enough to 
be firm when cold.. Put in jelly glasses, and when cool cover with paraf- 
fin, or any' other -material used fcir keeping air from jellies. 

Rhubarb and Fig Marmalade.— Three pounds of rhubarb, three pounds 



140 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

of sugar, one pound of figs, juice of one lemon and grated rind of half. 
Wash the figs and cut fine and put in the bottom of the kettle; cut rhu- 
barb into inch cubes and spread evenly over the figs; over the rhubarb 
distribute one pound of the sugar and let stand over night. In the morn- 
ing cook slowly until it looks clear, then add remainder of sugar and cook 
until thick. About fifteen minutes before taking from the stove add 
juice and rind of lemon. This quantity will make two quair-ts of mar- 
malade. It can be sealed while hot, or put in jelly glasses and covered 
with paraffin. 

Rhubarb and Orange Marmalade. — Three pounds of rhubarb, four 
and one-half pounds of sugar, three oranges, the grated rind of one 
orange. After grating the yellow from one orange, remove the peel 
from all three and cut in small pieces. Cut the rhubarb in inch cubes, 
mix with one and one-half pounds of sugar and the oranges and let 
stand twenty-four hours. Cock until it looks clear, then heat the re- 
maining three pounds of sugar, add, and cook until thick. 

Rhubarb and Raisin Marmalade. — Four pounds rhubarb, four oranges, 
juice of all, peel of two; four pounds sugar, one lemon, two pounds of 
raisins. Pee! and cut the rhubarb into half-inch pieces., Prepare the 
oranges by squeezing out juice and cooking the peel in water till tender. 
Drain and scrape out white skin. Extract the juice of the lemon. Put 
the rhubarb into a granite preserving kettle, heat it slowly to boiling, 
cook fifteen minutes, then add the sugar, orange juice and peel, lemon 
juice and raisins, and cook slowly until thick. 

Spiced Rhubarb. — Peel and slice 2J4 pounds of rhubarb; sprinkle a 
pound of sugar over it and let stand until morning. Drain off the syrup 
and add one cup of sugar and half a cupful each of vinegar and water. 
Drop into this syrup small bags filled with a mixture composed of one- 
third of a teaspoonful each of cloves, mace, allspice and ginger, and a 
teaspoonful of cinnamon. Boil until the syrup begins to thicken, then 
take out the bags and add the rhubarb and cook until clear. 

Canned Strawberries. — To can strawberries so that they will keep 
their shape and color, after the berries are picked over, put them in n 
jar, with a layer of sugar and then of berries until all are used. Set 
them in the cellar over night, and the sugar will penetrate them, and no 
v/afer must be added: there will be sufficient juice. Have a sugar syrup 
on the stove hot, put the strawberries in and let them boil Up gently; 
llicn fill cans with the fruit and juice all cooked together. Screw on 
the cover, stand the can upside down a few minutes, then, turn again, 
changing it in this way until it is cool, and the berries will- not rise to 
the top. This way preserves the shape, color, and flavor of the fruit. 

Canned Strawberries, No. 3. — An excellent way to can strawberries, 
raspberries or any fruit that requires little or no cooking is the follow- 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 141 

ing: Prepare fruit carefully, discarding all blemished or imperfect berries. 
Prepare a syrup of one quart of water boiled, one cupful of sugar. More 
or less sugar may be added according to the taste of family and the 
acidity of the fruit to be cai^ned. Have jars thoroughly sterilized as 
above, fill with the prepared fruit, pour over the syrup until it is filled to 
the brim. Screw on cap after adjusting rubber. Place jars in a stone 
crock with thin strips of board or a cloth under them and pour around 
them enough boiling water to fill crock up to the rubbers on jars. Cover 
with blankets, carpets, etc., to exclude air, and leave over night or until 
the water is cold. Canned in this way soft fruits keep both shape and 
color, and very nearly resemble fresh fruit. Fruits that lose color, such 
a.': strawberries or red raspberries, should have paper bags or pasteboard 
boxes slipped over them to exclude the light. 

Canned Strawberries, No. 3. — Fill a quart jar with large, ripe berries, 
from which the hulls have been taken; fill the jar with cold water; then 
pour it out again into a measure. For every twelve jars to be put up 
use thirteen of these measures of water and in it dissolve six pounds of 
sugar. Pack the jar with berries as closely as possible without mashing 
them. Fill each jar up to the shoulder with syrup, cover loosely with 
the lid and set it in a large boiler, which should have a loosely fitting 
v/ooden bottom pierced with holes. If set on the metal bottom the jars 
are liable to crack. When the boiler is full of jars pour in cold water 
up to their <;houlders ; cover it and set it on the fire. At the same time 
put the surplus syrup in a saucepan and allow it to become hot. As soon 
as the water in the boiler begins to boil note the time, and when it has 
boiled for eight minutes remove the boiler from the fire. Take out one 
jar at a time, fill it even with the hot syrup in the saucepan, fasten it 
airtight and stand it back in the boiler until all are filled and covered; 
lei. them stand there until cold, and then store in a cool place. 

Uncooked Canned Strawberries. — A correspondent of the Chicago 
Record-Herald says that she has preserved strawberries and red raspber- 
lies without cooking for years with entire success. Her method is as fol- 
lows : Mash together with a silver fork equal quantities of fruit and sugar. 
Let stand for an hour or more until the sugar is entirely dissolved. 
Then put into jelly glasses or pint jars, filling to the brim. Leave un- 
covered for 48 hours in an open window exposed to the sun. Then seal 
in the usual way and keep in a cool, dark place. The flavor of the ber- 
ries is as when picked, and the jam is rich and delicious. All utensils 
used must be absolutely clean and jars sterilized. 

Dried Strawberries. — One quart of strawberries, clean off the stem and 
hull. Wash ; add one pound of granulated sugar, put in a porcelain 
or granite kettle, set on stove, and heat gently till they come to a boiling 
l)oint, then boil hard for 20 minutes. Do not stir, just shake the kettle 



142 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

enongh to keep from burning, then pour out on large plates, and dry 
in the sun for at least three days, or until the juice has become jellied; 
't may take a longer time or a little less according to heat of sun. Do 
not let them stay out of doors over night, as the dew will cause the 
juice to get thin again. When the juice has become jellied, pack in jars 
and make airtight. These are most delicious and very delicate in flavor; 
the berries are whole and clear. 

Strawberry and Currant Jam. — To every pound of fruit allow three- 
quarters of a pound of sugar, also one pint of red currant juice to every 
four pounds of the berries. Boil the currant juice with the strawberries 
for half an hour, stirring all the time, then add the sugar and boil 20 
minutes longer, skimming carefully. Put in small jars or tumblers with 
paraffin on top. The currant juice may be omitted. 

Wiesbaden Strawberries. — Take six pounds of strawberries — they need 
not be large or extra fine, but they must be sound; add to them in the 
kettle a very little cold water and cook slowly as for jelly. Pour in a 
jelly bag and allow them to drip overnight. In the morning add to the 
juice six pounds of broken loaf or granulated sugar and half a pound 
of strained honey. Boil to a very thick syrup Fill pint cans with freshly 
capped strawberries, the largest and finest to be had. Screw on the tops, 
set in cold water in a large kettle- — the wash boiler will do — and let the 
water come to a boil. Open the jars and fill to the brim with the 
hot syrup. Seal and put away in a cool, dark place. 

Tomato Butter. — Cook ripe tomatoes, salt to taste and put them 
through a colander to remove the seeds. Have ready an equal quantity 
of sour apple sauce, well cooked; add it to the tomatoes, sweeten slightly 
and let it boil until the mixture begins to thicken. Be careful that it does 
not burn. Seal in jelly glasses. Excellent to serve with meats. 

Tomato Butter No. 2. — Seven pounds of large, ripe tomatoes, four 
pounds of brown sugar, half a cupful of vinegar, one teaspoonful of 
cinnamon, one teaspoonful of cloves. Pour boiling water over the toma- 
toes; let stand five minutes, then the skins can be rubbed off. Remove 
stem end, then slice tomatoes. Cook until soft, add the sugar and stew 
until very thick; then add spices and vinegar. Let simmer 20 minutes, 
pour into jars and seal. 

Tomato and Apple Butter. — Scald' and skin ripe tomatoes, add a 
quarter of the quantity of pared, cored and quartered pleasant sour 
apples. Weigh the kettle, put in the tomatoes and apples and cook to the 
consistency of marmalade, then to every six pounds add a teaspoonful of 
ginger, the juice of a large lemon and four pounds of light brown sugar; 
boil fifteen minutes, or until it will spread smoothly. 

Green Tomato Butter. — Select tomatoes that are full grown, but quite 
green. Slice them thin. Make a syrup in proportion of one pound of 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 143 

sugar to two pounds of tomatoes. Boil down slowly for four hours or 
until the butter is smooth and thick, stirring frequently to prevent stick- 
ing. Flavor with lemon when done. 

Green Tomato Conserve. — For one peck of green tomatoes, slice six 
lemons without removing the skin, but taking out the seeds. Put to this 
quantity six pounds of sugar and boil until transparent and the syrup 
thick. Ginger root may be added if liked. 

Tomato Jam. — Select sound, ripe fruit and peel and quarter them. 
Then put them into the preserving kettle with an equal weight of loaf 
sugar, the strained juice and rind of a lemon for every four pounds of 
the fruit, and a little powdered ginger. Cook the mixture slowly until 
it jellies when tried on a spoon. Turn into jars and cover. 

Tomato Marmalade. — Remove the skin from four quarts of ripe 
tomatoes and slice. Cut six large lemons in halves, lengthwise, and slice 
very thin. Seed one cup of raisins. Put the tomatoes, raisins and 
lemons into a preserving kettle, in layers, alternating with four pounds 
of granulated sugar. Cook one hour on the front of stove. Then set 
the kettle back, and allow contents to simmer until it is of the consistency 
of marmalade. Put up, while hot, as jelly. This recipe makes about 
two and one-half quarts. When properly prepared no one article will be 
recognizable. The small yellow tomatoes are nice for such use. 

Tomato Marmalade No. 2. — For every two pounds of the tomatoes 
allow two pounds of sugar and the juice and grated rind of one lemon. 
Pour scalding water over the tomatoes to loosen the skins. After remov- 
ing the skin, mix the tomatoes with the sugar and boil slowly for one 
hour, stirring and skimming frequently. At the end of that time add 
the lemon juice and rind and cook another hour or until the whole is 
a thick, smooth mass. 

Tomato Mock-Orange Marmalade. — Scald and peel large-sized yellow 
tomatoes. Cut downward over each seed section, press open and remove 
all seeds with the thumb, leaving the pulp comparatively whole. To two 
parts of the prepared tomatoes allow one part of oranges, slicing thinly. 
Cover all with an equal quantity of sugar and let stand over night. In 
the morning pour off syrup and cook down about half, add the tomatoes 
and oranges and cook until the orange skins are transparent. Seal in 
jelly glasses. This is an original recipe, and is a delightful substitute 
for the genuine orange marmalade, though much cheaper. 

Tomato Mincemeat. — Chop fine four quarts of green tomatoes, drain 
off juice, cover with cold water and bring to a boil, scalding for 30 
minutes, then drain. Repeat till parboiled three times. Add two pounds 
brown sugar, one pound seeded raisins, one-half pound chopped citron, 
one large half cup chopped suet, one tablespoonful salt and one-half cup 



144 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

strong vinegar. Mix and cook until thick. When cold add one tea- 
spoonful each of ground cinnamon and cloves, and one tablespoonful of 
grated nutmeg (or suit taste). Mix thoroughly, and keep in open jar. 

Tomato Clove Preserves. — To four pounds of yellow plum tomatoes, 
not too ripe, allow four pounds of sugar, three lemons and one-half 
ounce (or according to taste) of whole cloves. Peel the tomatoes with- 
out breaking, sprinkle sugar over and let them stand over night. In the 
morning pour off the syrup, add the cloves and let it boil until thick, then 
strain. Return to fire and add the chopped pulp of the lemons, rejecting 
the skin, and the tomatoes, and cook gently until the tomatoes look clear. 
Put 'into jar.? and seal. To give a quite different flavor substitute one- 
half ounce of ginger root for the cloves, and proceed as above. 

Green Tomato Preserves. — Required, eight pounds of small green 
tomatoes, seven pounds of sugar, one ounce of ginger and mace mixed, 
and the juice of four lemons. Pierce each of the tomatoes with a fork 
and put them in the preserving kettle with all the other ingredients. Heat 
slowly, then boil until the tomatoes are clear, then skim them out and boil 
the syrup until thick. Put the tomatoes into jars and pour in the 
hot syrup. 

Yellow Tomato Preserves. — Put the tomatoes into a wire basket and 
plunge into boiling water to loosen the skins. When a cut is made across 
the skin its whole contents can be quickly squeezed out. Three-fourths 
of a pound of sugar is allov/ed for each poimd of the fruit pulp, and 
sometimes ginger root is added for flavoring. Prolonged cooking is not 
necessary; just before ready for the jars add several lemons sliced in 
thin even circles. 

Ruby Watermelon Preserves. — Dice the red portion of the melon, 
removing all seeds and every bit of the white part; weigh and tise'halt 
as much sugar as you have melon, adding to every six pounds of melon 
the juice and grated yellow rinds of two lemons. Put all together in a 
large granite kettle and boil slowly, stirring often until it is quite thick; 
at first you will think it is all gtfing to water, but very soon you will 
notice it thicken nicely; when it has become as thick as you like it, seal 
hot in glass pint jars. 



JELLIES. 

Jelly should never be stored in a cellar. It demands a cool, dry, dark 
place, which can be well ventilated, to insure its keeping perfectly. Great 
care must be given the juice, sugar, etc. The glasses should be hot, dry 
and clean (surgically clean, we mean). Small tapering cups or bowls 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 145 

make jelly a nicer shape to turn out to serve, but the regulation jelly glass 
with its tin top comes much cheaper. 

A safe rule with all fruits that do not get firm is to add sufficient sour 
apple juice to make the jelly the right consistency. By choosing a bright 
day, boiliitg the juice 20 minutes before adding the sugar and going strictly 
according to directions even an amateur can have success. The best 
jellies are not boiled as hard as wanted but sunned under glass for 
several days. 

For filling the glasses, use a china cup with a handle. A saucer or 
small plate held in the left hand and moved vvjth and under the cup will 
catch all drops. In case you do not fill a tumbler full from the first dip 
add the requisite quantity immediately afterward, so that all will stiffen 
together, otherwise there may be separation in the contents of the tumbler 
when it is turned out. As a general rule for jelly, wash and drain the 
fruit, then put it on the stove in a large stone crock, or in a granite 
vessel. The fruit should be mature, but not overripe. Add no water 
to spiall and juicy fruits. Large fruits, such as apples, peaches and pears, 
require some water; our rule is to put the fruit in the crock, and pour in 
enough water to show at the top. Cook slowly, but thoroughly, stirring 
the fruit, which will thus be sufficiently mashed. Strain through a flannel 
bag, which should be scalded first, or through a stout cotton or linen; the 
flannel insures clearness, but we have no trouble with this when properly 
boiled, nor do we add white of egg, as some cooks recommend. Most 
people advise letting the fruit drain over night, and boiling the next day, 
but we think it jellies better if the fruit is cooked, drained, and the juice 
boiled the same day. The bag is of course hung over a large china bowl, 
and pressed down a little with a wooden spoon; its own weight, however, 
soon drains it dry. The juice is measured, and put on to boil; granulated 
sugar is measured, cup for cup, and put in a bowl on the back of the 
stove, where it is heated, being stirred from time to time, so that by the 
time the juice boils it is well heated through. Any scum that arises is 
skimmed off, and as soon as the juice comes to a boil the warmed sugar 
is stirred in. Continue to skim it as needed, and notice when it comes 
to a boil. Currant jelly made in this way will only need three minutes' 
boiling; other small fruits a little longer; they should be tested in a little 
cup. If boiled too long jelly becomes ropy. If boiled too hard, so that 
sugar crystallizes on the sides of the kettle, which is stirred in afterwards, 
the jelly may candy. In making jelly from fruit to which water has been 
added, as crab apple, it is measured, and three-quarters the amount of 
sugar put to heat. When put in the kettle, the depth of juice is measured 
with a stick, on which are two notches, one for the original depth, and 
one for two-thirds the amount. As soon as the juice has boiled down 
one-third add the warmed sugar, and boil. 



148 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Apple Jelly. — We like Fall Pippins for this purpose, but Gravenstein 
or any other highly-flavored apple, nearly ripe, makes a fine jelly. The 
jelly is excellent without any additional flavoring, but we prefer to add 
Rose geranium leaves, which render it delicious; four leaves to a quart 
of jelly. The leaves are put in with the sugar, and taken out when the 
jelly is put in glasses. Another variation is made by using three whole 
cloves to a quart of jelly; this imitates the nutmeg jelly made in Trinidad, 
the spiciness being so faint that it does not overpower the fruit flavor. 
To prepare apples for jelly, wipe them with a damp cloth, remove the 
stem and blossom ends and cut in quarters. Put in granite or porcelain- 
lined preserve kettle, and for three pounds of apples add one pint of 
water. Cover and cook slowly until apples are soft; mash, then drain 
through a coarse sieve. Do not squeeze, or jelly will be cloudy. Next 
allow juice to drip through a double thickness of cheesecloth or flannel 
jelly bag. Or they may be turned directly into jelly bag and allowed to 
drip over night. Measure juice, boil 30 minutes, and add an equal quan- 
tity of heated granulated sugar, boil five minutes, skim and turn into 
glasses that have been dipped into scalding water and placed on a wet 
cloth. Put a silver spoon in the tumbler before turning the jelly in as 
another means of avoiding cracking the glass ; it can be moved from 
tumbler to tumbler as you proceed. Fill brimming full, as the jelly will 
shrink as it cools. The glasses may now be placed in a sunny window, 
protected from dust, and let stand for 24 hours. Cover with melted 
paraffin, poured directly on to the jelly; then seal as usual. 

Apple Combination. — A housewife who has tried it says that a deli- 
cious combination jelly is made by cooking a half peck each of apples 
and quinces and a quart of cranberries together until soft, after barely 
covering with water. Strain, and to every pint of juice allow a scant pint 
of sugar, then proceed as with other jellies. It is delicately flavored, and' 
a beautiful pink in color. 

Barberry Jelly.^For domestic use the berries should not be gathered 
until well frosted. For jelly the fruit need not be stripped from the stems. 
Put the fruit in a porcelain kettle with water to come to the top of the 
berries and boil until thoroughly cooked, then put into a jelly bag and 
drain out the juice; return the juice to the kettle and boil hard 15 minutes. 
Measure it before boiling down. Add a pound of sugar to each pint and 
boil rapidly 10 minutes, then put away in glasses. This is an excellent 
jelly to serve with meat. 

Blackberry Jelly. — Make the same as currant jelly. 

Crab-apple Jelly. — Wash, cut in pieces two gallons of crab apples; 
place in the preserving kettle, just cover with cold water and cook until 
the pieces are tender. Drain through cheesecloth, measure, and when 
the juice has boiled 10 minutes, stir in one pound white sugar to each 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. WT 

pint of juice. Boil hard until it is jelly; about 10 minutes' boiling after 
the sugar has been added. Now take the tender pieces left after straining, 
rub through a sieve or colander; to each pint of pulp add one-half as 
much sugar. Cook until the sugar is thoroughly blended with the pulp, 
stirring quite frequently. Add spices if preferred, fill into glass cans, seal, 
and take to the cellar when cool. This makes a delicious butter, almost 
a marmalade, and is very nice in the Winter with pork. Two gallons of 
crab apples will make six glasses of jelly and five or six quarts of butter 
with the addition of H pounds of sugar. Crab apple will mix well with 
wild grapes for jelly. The two fruits should be cooked together, and 
made like any other jelly. The proportion may be whatever is most 
convenient; half and half, or one-third grapes to two-thirds apples, will 
be found excellent. 

Wild Crab-apple Jelly. — Cook the cored crabs till tender and drip in a 
jelly bag. Use more sugar than for ordinary jelly — about five cups of 
sugar to four of juice — and cook quickly. This is delicious both in 
color and flavor. 

Mrs. C.'s Currant Jelly. — The currants are picked over as if for 
canning, then put in the preserving kettle. As the fruit heats, it is mashed 
with a large spoon until juice is pretty nearly all extracted. The juice 
fs all dipped off and her jelly is made according to the common recipe. 
She now adds to the currants left in kettle an equal amount of raspber- 
rtes — either black or red is added, and jam is made by the addition of 
three-fourths of a pound of granulated sugar to each pound of fruit. 
In this way she says jelly making is an easy task, and she also has the 
consciousness of having used every bit of the currants. 

Elderberry Jelly. — Strip the ripe berries into the kettle and stir over 
the fire with a wooden spoon until the juice flows freely; turn into a 
jelly bag and let drain without touching so as not to become cloudy. 
Weigh and boil sharply 15 minutes. Remove from fire and add sugar, 
allowing 14 ounces to one pint of juice. Boil 15 minutes, stirring and 
skimming until it jellies. This is an English recipe and a very good one. 

Elderberry Jelly No. 2. — Take equal parts of elderberries and wild 
grapes, and cook to extract juice, strain, add sugar in proportion of one 
pound to each pint of liquid, and cook as other jelly. This is especially 
nice for invalids, and beneficial in cases of sore throat. 

Grape Jelly. — The wild grapes gathered just as they begin to turn are 
the best for jelly. Free them from their stems and wash them, mash 
them, and heat slowly; cook them until the juice is well drawn out; turn 
into a flannel bag and let it drip without pressure ; measure the juice, and, 
if cultivated grapes are used, allow an equal amount of sugar ; if the wild 
grape, allow a little more than an equal measure. Heat the sugar (put in 
a pan in the oven and stir often) ; boil the strained juice 15 minutes; skim 



148 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

and strain again, add the sugar, boil until the surface looks wrinkled, skim 
well and turn into glasses. 

Green Grape Jelly. — Select the grapes when full grown, just before 
they begin to turn purple. After separating from the stem, wash, adding 
a little water if the grapes are not very juicy. Mash and stew until the 
skins are cooked. Strain first through the colander, then through the jelly 
bag. Measure the juice, measure the same amount of sugar, putting it in 
the oven while the juice is being boiled. The boiling will take half an 
hour. Now add the hot sugar, which you must be careful not to scorch, 
boil about five minutes longer, and then the jelly should be ready to pour 
in glasses. Jelly made from the green grapes is solid, of a delicious flavor 
and of a pretty green tint. 

Spiced Grape Jelly. — This is delicious served with cold meats. Take 
equal amounts of grape juice and sugar. Add one-half teaspoonful of 
ground cloves and one tablespoonful of cinnamon to each quart of juice. 
Add the sugar as directed in recipe above. 

Marble Jelly. — A dark jelly, such as blackberry or grape, is poured into 
a half-gallon crock; as soon as this hardens a light jelly, apple, quin.;e or 
pear, is poured on top ; so on in alternate layers until the crock is filled. 
The layers look prettiest when but an inch thick. Slice in half-inch slices, 
serve on a pretty glass dish. Besides being unique in appearance the 
blending of flavors is decidedly appetizing. 

Peach Jelly. — Take sound, high-flavored, barely ripe peaches. Wash 
them thoroughly. Use the parings and a few pieces of fruit. Boil in 
enough water to cover in an enameled kettle until the skins are tender 
and broken. Strain through a jelly bag. Allow the juice of one lemon 
and one scant pound of sugar to each pint of juice. Boil the juice twenty 
minutes after straining, and meantime heat the sugar in the oven. Put 
the sugar into the juice slowly, let boil five minutes and pour into tumblers. 

Peach Jelly No. 3. — Take the peach parings from a peck or two of 
peaches and simmer with sour apples till the whole mass is tender. Have 
twice the quantity of peach that you have of apple and make your jelly 
in the ordinary way. 

Pear Jelly. — Select juicy pears that are not top ripe, quarter, core and 
cut in small pieces without paring. Put in a kettle with one pint of 
water to every four pounds of pears. Cook over a slow fire to a pulp, 
turn into a jelly bag which has been wrung out, and let drip without 
squeezing. Measure the juice and allow the same quantity of sugar. Put 
the liquid over the fire, bring to the boiling point and boil 20 minutes. In 
the meantime heat the sugar by spreading it out on pans and setting it in 
an open oven; when the pear juice has boiled twenty minutes add the 
heated sugar, stir until it is dissolved, bring again to the boiling point, 
and boil until in dropping a spoonful on a cold saucer a skin forms 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 149 

quickly over it ; this will generally occur after five or ten minutes' boiling. 
Take from the fire and pour into -jelly glasses. Let stand until cold, pour 
over the top of each glass a little melted paraffin, and when it hardens 
cover. 

Plum Jelly. — Pour boiling water over one-half peck of plums placed 
in a colander. Then put them in a preserving kettle, pour over them just 
enough water to cover and boil until the plums have become soft and 
the juice has flowed out. Drain through a colander, then through a jelly 
bag without squeezing. Measure juice and put to boil in preserve kettle. 
Add one dozen blanched plum kernels. Allow an equal measure of 
granulated sugar and put it to heat in shallow pans in the oven. When 
the juice has boiled 20 minutes skim well, add the hot sugar, stir until 
dissolved, let come to the boiling point, take immediately from the fire 
and fill into glasses which have been rolled in boiling water, drained and 
stood upright on a cloth folded in a shallow pan of boiling water. Use 
a small teacup to dip the jelly into the tumblers, and fill them very full. 
Cover airtight next day. The pulp remaining may be used to make a 
little marmalade, allowing three-quarters of a pint of sugar to one pint 
of pulp, and a few blanched kernels from the plum stones. 

Plum and Green Grape Jelly. — Plums mixed with green grapes make 
the most delicious of all tart jellies. Small yellow plums are the best. 
Wash, pick and scald them with their own bulk of green grapes picked 
from the stem, strain out the juice, let it settle 10 minutes, then pour it 
carefully off the sediment. Put in a shallow kettle over a quick fire, boil 
for five minutes, skimming well; then add for each pint of juice a pound 
and a quarter of very hot granulated sugar; stir hard until the sugar 
dissolves; then skim again and boil hard for two minutes. Drop a little 
in ice water — the minute this hardens take it off the fire and pour into 
hot glasses. 

Plum and Peach.— Japan plums not quite ripe, with a few peaches, 
make a nice clear amber jelly. 

Quince Jelly. — Simmer the quinces in a stone jar till tender in enough 
water to cover them. Drip and strain the juice and boil 30 minutes before 
adding an almost equal amount of sugar. This will be a beautiful color 
if well made and have a delicate flavor. 

Quince Jelly No. 2. — Place the parings and cores left from preserving 
in the preserving kettle, cover with cold water and cook until the parings 
are soft; strain through cheesecloth, measure, and when boiling hard, put 
a pound of white sugar to each pint of the juice. Boil hard until it will 
set. Ten minutes of hard boiling is usually enough; then pour into 
glasses. 

Quince and Cranberry. — Stew cores and skins of quinces in very little 
water, and strain the juice as for quince jelly; stew tart cranberries 



150 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

separately in very little water, strain, and combine with an equal propor- 
tion of quince juice. Add to the combined juices one cupful of sugar to 
each cupiul of juice, and boil briskly until it jellies. 

Raspberry Jelly. — One of our friends tells us with pride that she made 
delicious stiff raspberry jelly last year by mixing the red raspberries with 
an equal quantity of green grapes. The two fruits were cooked together, 
then strained as usual. The resulting jelly was clear red, with full rasp- 
berry flavor. Our friend had never been able to make raspberries "jell" 
properly before, so she was much pleased with the experiment. It is 
quite possible that green grapes would stiffen strawberry jelly, which is 
usually difficult to harden. Some experimenters say they mix either red 
currants or early apples with strawberries to make jelly. If raspberries 
and Summer apples are available at the same time, a combination of the 
two will make an excellent jelly. Cook and strain separately, then mix 
the juice, and proceed as with any other jelly. Raspberry and red cur- 
rants mixed are excellent. 

Rhubarb Jelly. — On account of the watery consistency of the fruit it 
cannot be made into jelly as readily as most fruit. A fine jelly and one 
specially suitable for serving with game can be made if the following 
directions are observed : Let the rhubarb heat on the back of the stove 
until the juice flows freely. Strain the juice through a jelly bag. Do not 
squeeze the bag into the jelly, but use only what will drip of itself. The 
bag can be squeezed into a different vessel, and the liquid thus gained can 
be re-added to the pulp of the rhubart and made into jam. Take the 
rhubarb juice and boil gently for 10 minutes. Measure and to each pint 
allow a pound of granulated sugar. Boil until a little poured out on a 
cold plate will set nicely. Do not measure the juice before it has been 
boiled. Such treatment is needed to reduce the water and make the pure 
juice and sugar jelly properly. If care is taken in the boiling of the 
jelly, it turns out a pretty color and is very desirable for garnishing 
various dishes. 

Rhubarb Jelly No. 3. — 'Cut ofif the leaves and ends from the stalks,, 
and wipe with a clean, damp cloth. Use an earthen dish for cooking. 
Without removing the skins, cut the rhubarb into pieces SJ/^ inches long, 
and put over them 1^ cupful of sugar, a piece of lemon peel, and a pint 
of water, this proportion to two pounds of rhubarb. Cover and set in 
the oven on a shelf. Moisten a half ounce of white gelatine in a quarter 
of a cupful of cold water. When the rhubarb is tender put the gelatine 
in a large bowl, on which an earthen colander is placed. Pour the 
rhubarb on this, but remove it very soon to a dish, in order to retain 
sufficient juice with it. Stir the hot liquid underneath, and when the 
gelatine is dissolved pour into teacups or molds dipped in cold water. 

Strawberry Jelly. — To 10 quarts of strawberries add two quarts of 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 151 

currants, and proceed as for currant jelly, but boil 15 minutes. Or 
use apple juice instead of currants. 

Tomato Jelly. — Simmer yellow tomatoes without water till pulpy and 
then drip in a bag. Take equal parts of tomato and apple juice and 
proceed in the ordinary way. 

Watermelon Jelly. — Mash the heart of a dead-ripe melon and strain 
the juice so obtained. Boil to a thick syrup with equal parts of granu- 
lated sugar and add to apple juice; then proceed as for apple jelly. 

We always pour melted ' paraffin over the top of our jelly before 
putting the cover on. Break the paraffin in pieces, put in a cup, and set 
the cup in a paji of warm water on the back of the stove; it will soon 
melt enough to pour. It should be one-fourth inch thick over the jelly; 
if too thin it cracks. If you have reason to fear mold, cut disks of white 
paper to fit the top of the glass; dip in brandy or grain alcohol, and pour 
the parai&n over this. If the room or closet in which jelly is stored is 
damp. Prof. Conn recommends setting a few lumps of unslaked lime about 
on the shelves, removing when they crumble. 



CANDIED FRUITS. 

Cherries. — Get large, sound cherries and cut off the stem to avoid tear- 
ing the fruit. Wipe with a soft cloth. Weigh the cherries and then 
weigh out an equal amount of fine sugar. Sprinkle a little sugar over the 
cherries and let them stand over night. With the rest of the sugar make a 
thick syrup and let that stand over night. In the morning bring the syrup 
to boiling heat; put the cherries in and boil for five minutes. Let them 
stand together for 24 hours, drain off the syrup and boil long enough to 
get rid of the juice from the cherries (until a thick syrup as it was at 
first) and pour over the cherries. The next morning drain off the syrup 
and boil to candy degree. Dip each cherry in this and put on a sieve, in 
a warm place to dry. When perfectly dry pack in glass, or in boxes with 
waxed paper between layers. 

Oranges. — Peel the oranges and separate the sections without breaking 
the white skin that covers them. Place on plates and keep where it is 
warm until dry. Make a syrup with granulated sugar; boil until it will 
thread and then add two tablespoonfuls of vinegar for each pound of 
sugar used. Boil until it begins to turn straw-colored. The instant this 
change of color shows lift the pan and set it in a pan of boiling water. 
Now take the sections of orange on a greased fork; dip them carefully 
in the syrup, and drop on waxed paper to dry. Lay the orange on the 
fork, never stick the fork through the skin. If the syrup begins to harden 
it may be heated again. Don't stir the syrup at any stage of the work, 



153 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

and when dipping tlie orange do it gently, or the syrup will be spoiled, aiid 
for this reason it is not advisable to use more than a pound of sugar ;at 
one time. 

Peaches. — Pare and halve enough large peaches to weigh two pounds. 
Make a syrup with one-half a pound of sugar and a cup of water by 
boiling together for five minutes. Drop the fruit in and cook gently until 
tender, then drain out and spread on plates. Boil the syrup unt'l fairly 
thick and pour over the fruit. Place the plates in a warm oven ; turn the 
ftuit over frequently until dry. Roll each piece in granulated gugar and 
put in hot sunshine. Let stand in sun an hour or two. Wh^n copied 
pack in layers between waxed paper. -. 

Pineapple. — Get the finest fruit to be had ; pare and cut into the thin- 
nest possible slices. Weigh, and allow a pound of sugar to each pound of 
fruit. Spread sliced fruit on platters and sprinkle the sugar over it. Keep 
in a warm place for a week — or until dry — then put in a hot oven for 10 
minutes. When cold, pack between waxed papers. 

Quinces. — Boil fruit until tender in as little water as possibte- (may 
be steamed) and put through a sieve. Weigh the sifted fruit and to each 
pound of 'fruit allow a pound of sugar. Put fruit and sugar together 
and boil until very thick. Spread on plates ; dry in oven or sun ; cut in 
bars; roll in sugar; dry again, and pack like the .others described, or wrap 
each bar in waxed paper. Tin boxes are fine for packing away these 
fruits, but small tin pails will serve the purpose equally well. Glass cans 
are good so far as keeping quality goes, but are not so easy to use. 

CANNING VEGETABLES. 

Vegetables for canning should be fresh gathered, and of the highest 
quality, -just in the right condition for eating. 

Asparagus. — Straight-sided quart glass jars, such as the "Royal," should 
be used for asparagus, so as to avoid breaking the stalks. Wash care- 
fully, cut the right length to stand the whole stalk upright in the jar 
and pack in snugly, heads up ; then pour in cold water slowly, until the 
jar is full to overflowing, and lay on the tops. Place straw or boards in 
the bottom of the wash-boiler, stand the jars on this, and pour in enough 
cold water to come half way up the jars; put the- boiler over the fire, and 
when the v/ater comes to a boil, boil steadily for three hours. Take up 
the jars, see that they are full to overflowing (if not fill up with boiling 
water) put on rubbers and screw or otherwise fasten the covers tight. 
Keep in a cool, dark place. Another recipe recommends boiling the 
asparagus for 15 minutes, then putting in the jar, and boiling in the 
wash-boiler for 1^4 hour, but we think some of the stalks are very 
likely to be broken by this method. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 153 

' Beans. — String beans are cut in lengths, boiled for 10 minutes, then 
pilt into cans, which are stood in a kettle of water and boiled for two 
hdurs. Add a teaspoonful of salt, fill the jar to overflowing with boiling 
water, screw up, and keep in a cool dark place. Another plan is as 
fc^llows : Wash and break each pod in two or three pieces, put on the 
stbve in a saucepan of cold salt water and when it just commences to 
bubble (don't let it boil) drain the beans out and put in cans that have 
been washed and scalded. Have ready another saucepan of boiling salt 
wkter and fill the cans nearly to the brim, leaving just room enough for 
oiie tablespoonful of hot vinegar, screw on the caps and set away. When 
wanted for use pour off the brine and put in a saucepan of fresh water 
with a pinch of soda added ; let them come to a boil and immediately 
pour off the water, then cook as you would fresh beans. 

) Dried String Beans. — When fit for the table pick and prepare them 
by removing the strings and breaking up into inch pieces ; put into a 
kettle of cold water and then bring to a scalding heat. Skim out, spread 
on plates and dry in the oven or out of doors until all moisture is 
removed. Put away in bags until snow flies, then take out a quart and 
soak in cold water over night. Next morning boil with a good-sized 
piece of sweet salt pork until tender. 

\ Beets. — Young beets are delicious canned; cook until tender in salted 
wjater the same as for table use. Cut in thin slices, fill the cans and cover 
with hot vinegar, sweetened and spiced, seal. 

, Cauliflower. — Cauliflower may be canned either in vinegar or water. 
Break into flowerets and cook until tender in a small quantity of water, 
pack the cans as full as possible, add the salt, and fill to overflowing with 
hot liquor in which it was cooked, seal. When vinegar is used, steam the 
cauliflower until tender, fill into cans and pour over hot vinegar, sweet- 
ened and spiced. 

■ Corn. — For canned corn cut- the kernels off the cob with a sharp 
knife, scraping out the pulp. Fill into the can a little at a time, pressing 
it down firmly until the milk overflows the can. Add a teaspoonful of 
salt. When all are filled place the cans in a boiler and cook half an 
hour with the covers laid loosely on. Remove from the fire and seal, 
then cook two hours longer. The preliminary cooking permits the corn 
to swell without endangering the cans, which may burst if tightly sealed 
from the first. Succotash is canned by first half filling the cans with 
green Lima beans, then filling the remainder of the can with corn, 
pressed down firmly. Add a teaspoonful of salt to each can, and cook 
Iik« corn. 

■ -Salted Corn. — This recipe has been highly endorsed by readers who 
have tried it. Have corn "just right" for eating. While it may be 
brought from the field the previous evening it should not be prepared 



154 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

otherwise until the following morning, as there is danger of its souring. 
Clean and scald your boiler thoroughly and fill with the corn properly 
husked and silked, discarding all ears either over or under ripe. Cook 
as for the table. Removing from the boiler, score each row of kernels 
with a sharp knife and shave off not too close to the cob. After cutting 
from cob, measure and to each eight pints of corn add one pint of salt 
and mix thoroughly with the hands until a brine is formed. Have ready 
a well-scalded and clean crock and pack corn in this as it is mixed. 
When jar is filled within one inch of top, cover with a clean white cloth 
large enough to hang over edge of crock. Ota this cloth put about an 
inch of salt, and on the salt a plate that fits the top of jar. Now it is 
ready to put in the cellar or any cool place for Fall and Winter use, but 
in its preparation for the table lies the secret of its success. There is 
only one way of, making it palatable, but with directions strictly adhered 
to it is preferred by many to canned corn. About one and one-half hour 
before the meal at which one wishes to serve it it must be brought from 
the cellar — enough for one meal— and cold water enough to cover poured 
on and at once poured off. Then sufficient boiling water is poured on to 
cover and it is allowed to stand on the back of the range for 15 minutes. 
This water is drained off and sufficient fresh boiling water poured on to 
cover and the same time allowed. This process is repeated twice more, 
in all four times. Then cream, butter, sugar and if liked a little pepper 
is added. In short after pouring off the water for the fourth time it is 
prepared exactly as canned corn. The process of removing the salt by a 
swift boiling water process instead of a slow cold water process seems 
to leave the corn as fresh as when taken from the cob. This, together 
with the ease with which it is prepared — so much easier and surer than 
canning — makes the process ideal. 

Southern Dried Corn. — Sew firmly into a quilting-frame a strong 
sheet. Gather the corn when ready for use, husk and remove silk. Put 
on in boiler, cover with water and when it starts boiling let cook well 
for 10 or 15 minutes. Take off, allow it to cool some, then score and cut 
off, but not too close, to have it shucky, and scrape off what remains on 
ear. Have your frame out in a sunny place, spread corn evenly upon it, 
cover with a mosquito netting and it will dry quickly in this way, as it 
dries from below just as fast as above. Then at some convenient time 
when the oven is piping hot put it in the oven to heat well through in 
order to kill any chance "'microbe.'' When it comes time to cook the 
dried corn wash well in water. Put to soak in milk over night and cook 
in the milk it soaked in; season with sugar, salt, pepper and butter, and 
you will find it very good and know that it is clean. 

Uncooked Canned Corn. — Prepare corn by removing husks and silk; 
break into pieces large enough to fit into two-quart cans. Season cold 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 155 

water with just enough salt to taste. Then fill the cans up with this 
salt water; have new rubbers for cans, and when you have got the air 
bubbles all out seal your cans and stand them upside down to see that 
they do not leak. If they do not your corn will keep all right. Some 
cut it off and can same way, but always fill the can first and then put 
in the salt water. We are told that this corn keeps perfectly. 

Peas.-^To can peas, fill the jars full of peas, uncooked; then fill 
with cold water, and lay on the tops. Place straw or boards in the 
bottom of the wash boiler, stand the jars on this, and pour enough cold 
water in the boiler to come half way up the jars. Put the boiler on the 
stove with the lid tightly closed, and boil three hours. When the jars 
are taken out, see that they are full to overflowing, and screw the lid 
on tight. Another method of preparing peas is to cook five minutes 
in very little water, then fill the cans, and place them in the boiler to 
cook for one hour. A teaspoonful of salt is added the last thing before 
sealing. 

Dried Peas. — Green peas are dried as follows : Shell the peas, put 
them in boiling water, and boil for five minutes. Drain, then spread out 
in shallow trays, and dry in the sun, or near the stove. When dry, store 
away in paper bags, in a dry place. The peas should be soaked before 
using; then boiled in salted water. 

Tomatoes. — Scald to remove the skins, put in the jars whole or halved, 
fill up with cold water; stand the jars in the wash boiler, boil 30 minutes, 
and seal. Do not use any overripe or fermenting fruit. The main things 
to observe in canning vegetables are that the jars are filled to overflow- 
ing^ that they are hermetically sealed, while hot, and that they are stored 
in a cool, dry place. Vegetables, like fruits, should be taken in their 
regular order and canned while in the best possible condition. 

Tomatoes Canned Whole. — Select firm, smooth fruit, not overripe, 
and of a size to slip into the ordinary fruit jar. Peel without breaking 
and with as little scalding as possible. Have ready a preserving kettle 
full of water, which has been salted slightly, only enough to taste. Just - 
before the water reaches the boiling point drop the tomatoes into it, one 
layer at a time and heat through. Do not allow the water to boil at 
any time. When thoroughly heated transfer tomatoes to the cans, being 
careful not to bruise them. Fill the cans with the hot, salted water, and 
screw the tops on quickly. Turn the cans over in a deep kettle of hot 
water until the rubbers are heated and set, which hermetically seals the 
cans. In using drain from the salt water, and serve exactly as fresh 
tomatoes. 



CHAPTER XII. 
picki.es and remshes. 

Amber Pickles. — Choose sirall yellow pear tomatoes when just turn- 
ing to ripen. Prick each tomato with a needle three times to prevent 
bursting in. cooking, and soak half an hour in salted water. Take out 
and put in jars, after which make a syrup of one pint of vinegar, three- 
quarters of a pound of -C sugar and a pinch of salt, and put to boil in 
a porcelain kettle. Tate one-half dozen cloves, same of whole allspice, 
one peppercorn, a piece of cinnamon, a splinter of mace and a chip c^f 
ginger root ; tie all in a cheesecloth bag and boil ten minutes in the 
syrup. Remove spice bag and put the tomatoes in the kettle until they 
are heated through (do not let boil), take out with skimmer and put 
in jars. Boil syrup 20 minutes longer and, pour hot over tomatoes. Next 
day pour off syrup, reheat and pour over tomatoes, and seal in jars. 

Apple Pickle. — Eighteen good sharp • apples ; one-quarter pound best 
ginger ; one pound Sultana raisins ; one ounce mustard seed ; six shallots ; 
one-quarter pound salt; V/i pound moist sugar; six good-sized onions; 
one-half ounce small chilli peppers; one-half teaspoon cayenne pepper. 
Three pints white wine vinegar. Pare and quarter apples and place in a 
double boiler, cover tightly to keep in steam, cook till quite soft; chop 
onions and shallots, and boil in vmegar until they are soft also. Then 
mix ingredients together, and place in an iron saucepan, no other mfetal 
will do. Boil for three-quarters of an hour, stirring faithfully, as it 
burns very quickly. Put down in small pots well sealed. This pickle 
will remain good for years. It should stand two months before using. 

Sweet Apple Pickle. — Three pounds of sugar to seven of cored 
apples, and one pint of vinegar. Steam the apples till tender, but not 
too much; stick a clove or two in every quarter. Make a syrup of the 
sugar and vinegar and pour while hot over the apples. May be kept in 
a well-covered jar in a cool place, and keep well. 

String Beans. — Cut the ends off the tiny pods and remove the little 
beginnings of ''strings,'' pack in glass jars, and pour in the boiling spiced 
and sweetened vinegar just as if making sweet pickled pears or peaches. 
If white wine vinegar is used the beans will retain their vivid green 
color and thus make a pretty as well as a delicious relish. 

Beets, Canned. — Select small, dark-red beets, about the size of a 
peach or smaller, boil in the usual way, being careful not to break the 
skins in washing ; do not cut the tops too close and be sure not to cut 
the ends off. Boil in s'alted water until tender, but not too soft. Rub 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 157 

the skins off as soon as they are cool enough to handle, also cut off 
top and tail and pack in fruit jars; set aside and prepare your vinegar. 
It will not be necessary to heat the beets over again. Put as much 
vinegar over the fire as will be required to cover the beets ; when this 
comes to a boil add a little sugar, according to taste. Let the vinegar 
boil five minutes longer; pour over the beets piping hot and seal. A 
small piece of horseradish put into each jar will keep the white scum 
from forming on the top of the vinegar. 

Beet Relish. — Boil two medium-sized beets until tender, drain and 
let stand in cold water three minutes, then skin, slice thin and cover with 
strong vinegar for one hour. Drain off the vinegar and mash the beets 
thoroughly, adding three tablespoons of grated horseradish, a pinch of 
salt and a dash of black pepper. 

Beet Sweet Pickle. — Boil till tender, then skin, and cut into slices or 
strips. Put in glass jars rather loosely, so that each piece will be sur- 
rounded by the pickle. To two quarts of vinegar add four pounds of 
brown sugar, and, when these are in the kettle, add a scant half-teaspoon- 
ful of pulverized alum. Use a porcelain-lined kettle for this liquid, and 
bring the contents to a boil. Skim carefully, and then add to it a small 
cheesecloth bag containing a teaspoonful each of whole peppercorns, 
allspice and cloves. Boil again, and add a little cayenne pepper and salt. 
Fill the jars to overflowing with this liquid, and set aside over night. The 
next morning drain the beets, and bring the syrup again to a hard boil. 
Pour this again into the jars of beets, doing so while it is scalding hot, 
and filling each jar to overflowing. Seal immediately. 

Blackberry Pickle. — Put a pint of the best cider vinegar in a granite 
kettle, together with four cupfuls of granulated sugar, one teaspoonful 
of ground cloves, and two teaspoonfuls of ground cinnamon; when it 
boils add three quarts of dewberries or blackberries that have been care- 
fully cleaned; let the fruit cock 10 minutes in the syrup, then skim the 
berries into a gallon jar; pour over the syrup and turn a plate over them 
to keep the berries below the surface; tie a double fold of cloth and 
thick paper over the jar when the fruit is cold and the pickle will 
keep perfectly. 

Cauliflower Pickles. — Two cauliflowers, broken up, one pint small 
onions, three medium-sized red peppers ; dissolve half a pint of salt in 
water sufficient to cover the vegetables, and let stand over night; drain 
in the morning; steam the vegetables until tender; heat two quarts of 
vinegar with three level tablespoonfuls of mustard (less if preferred) 
until it boils ; pour over vegetables ; bottle and seal. 

Pickled Cherries. — Five pounds of cherries, stoned or not, as pre- 
ferred; one quart of vinegar, two pounds Of sugar, one-half ounce of 
cinnamon, one-half ounce of cloves', same amount of mace, all ground. 



158 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Boil the sugar, vinegar and spices (tie the latter in a bag) together, and 
pour hot over the cherries. 

Spiced Cherries. — Make a syrup by boiling together four pounds of 
granulated sugar, one pint of vinegar, one-half ounce each of cinnamon 
bark and whole cloves. Cook in this till the skin breaks nine pounds 
of firm, ripe cherries^ 

Chopped Pickle. — One-half peck green tomatoes, two stalks of celery, 
one green pepper, one-half a cabbage, three large onions, all chopped, to 
which add one-half a cupful of mustard seed, two tablespoonfuls of 
celery seed, one-half cupful of brown sugar, one-quarter cupful of salt, 
one teaspoon ful of black pepper, the same of cinnamon, one saltspoonful 
each of cloves and allspice and one quart of vinegar. Mix all well to- 
gether and seal in Mason jars. Will keep perfectly. 

Chow Chow. — Wash thoroughly and chop without paring half a 
peck of green tomatoes; chop fine one large head of white cabbage; pare 
and chop six. large cucumbers; clean thoroughly and cut into small dice 
one bunch of celery and finely chop one large white onion. Mix all 
together, add half a cup of salt and let stand over night. Clean 100 
tiny pickles and fifty small silver-skinned onions; put into separate jars, 
cover with strong salt water and let them stand over night. The next 
morning drain the first mixture thoroughly, wash off the pickles and 
onions and wipe dry. Chop fine one large red mango pepper. Put all 
together into a preserving kettle, add two quarts, of the best cider 
vinegar (dilute somewhat if very strong), half a pound of granulated 
sugar, half an ounce each of turmeric and celery seed, one ounce of 
ground mustard seed. Cook 30 minutes, then bottle and seal. 

English Chow Chow. — This calls for two medium-sized heads of 
firm white cabbage, half a peck of green tomatoes, two quarts of firm 
ripe tomatoes, half a dozen green peppers and two red peppers. Chop 
all together as fine as you can, and pack the mixture in layers of salt. 
Put it in a coarse bag of burlap or some rough material. Lay it over a 
rack placed upon a deep keg or jar and put a heavy press upon it. Let it 
drain in this way over night, or for 34 hours. A pint and a half of 
sugar, half a cup of grated horseradish, half a teaspoonful of ground 
black pepper, half an even teaspoonful of ground mustard, an ounce of 
white mustard seed, an ounce of celery seed, a tablespoonful of ground 
mace and, finally, a gill of Dutch mustard compose the seasonings and 
must be added to the mixture. After it has drained suflSciently moisten 
the whole with enough good cider vinegar scantily to cover it. This 
chow chow requires no cooking and does not have to be put up in sealed 
jars. A stone crock is all sufficient, if kept in a cold, dry place. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 159 

Virginia Chow Chow. — This is an old recipe. One' peck each of 
green and ripe tomatoes, one large, firm head of cabbage, six each of 
green and ripe peppers, six large white onions and two bunches of 
celery. Chop the vegetables fine, sprinkle over them a cupful of coarse 
salt and let them soak 24 hours. Drain all the liquid off, cover with 
best cider vinegar, stir in one pound of dark brown sugar, one-half 
cupful of grated horse-radish, two tablespoonfuls of white mustard 
seed, one tablespoonful of ground ginger, one teaspoonful of ground 
cloves and the same amount of allspice. Let the pickle come slowly 
to the boiling point, then remove to the back of the range and let it 
stand for one hour. Seal up in Mason jars, and it will be ready for 
use in a week, but will improve with age. 

Corn and Cabbage. — Cut the kernels from 12 large ears of corn, add 
as much chopped cabbage as there is cut corn, one large sweet pepper 
freed from seeds and chopped, one cupful of brown sugar, two table- 
spoonfuls of salt, one-half tablespoonful of ground mustard and one 
quart of vinegar. Bring all to a boil and then can. 

Corn Relish. — Chop one head of cabbage; sprinkle over it two table- 
spoonfuls of salt and let stand over night. Cut the kernels from 12 
ears of corn; chop three peppers. Mix all together. Mix with them a 
little celery seed; grated horseradish, or both if liked, though neither 
are needed to insure the keeping qualities of the relish. Bring two 
quarts of vinegar to boiling heat; add one cup of sugar and a quarter 
of a pound of mustard that has been rubbed smooth in a little cold 
vinegar. Pour this hot dressing over the mixture; stir until well 
mixed; put in glass jars, or small jars. 

Corn Salad. — Eighteen large ears corn, one head cabbage, one-fourth 
pound ground mustard, four red peppers (chopped), one-half cup salt, 
one and two-thirds cup sugar, two quarts vinegar. Corn is shaved from 
cob, cabbage and peppers chopped and all ingredients thoroughly mixed. 
It is then cooked one hour. By cooking in oven it need not be stirred 
so frequently and there is much less danger of burning. It is canned 
and sealed while hot. 

Pickled Crab Apple. — One quart of vinegar, three pounds brown 
sugar; make this into a syrup. Have the apples in a gallon jar or one 
of size that will set in an iron kettle. Pour this syrup over them, have 
seasoning tied in small pieces of cheese cloth .and cook with the rest. 
Boil in the jar until a fork will go easily into the apples. The juice 
need not cover the fruit at first, the apples help make more. This 
keeps the fruit whole and is very satisfactory; it needs a weight like a 
small plate to keep apples under the liquor. 

Cucumbers in Barrels. — Choose small cucumbers free from spots. 
Put a layer of cucumbers in the bottom of a cask, then a layer of coarse 



160 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

salt, about one-fourth inch thick, then another layer of cucumbers, more 
salt, and so on until all are used. Place a board on top of the pickles, 
with a heavy stone to keep them down. Then pour in about a quart of 
water to moisten the salt, which, with the juice exuding from the cu- 
cumbers should make sufficient brine to cover. Continue to add cu- 
cumbers, as they are gathered, in layers as before; a few cabbage or 
horseradish leaves on top, under the board, will prevent molding. When 
the cask is full, tuck a cloth closely around the edges, put board and 
weight on top, and cover closely, and the cucumbers will keep for a 
year or two. When cucumbers are wanted for pickling, remove cloth, 
board and stone, and wash them, well in warm water ; wipe all scum 
from sides of cask with a clean cloth, take out cucumbers, and then 
cover any remaining as before. Soak cucumbers for three days in cold 
water, changing water each day ; drain and wipe carefully. Half fill a 
large porcelain-lined preserving kettle with good cider, vinegar, put in 
as many cucumbers as the vinegar will cover, with a piece of alum «the 
size of a hazelnut; heat to boiling point, stirring with a wooden spoon 
so that they do not soften at bottom of kettle, and then drain, throw- 
ing away the vinegar. Cover with fresh cold vinegar, spice if desired. 
A little chopped horseradish . at top will prevent molding. They will 
be ready for use in about a week. A great many cucumber pickles are 
sold direct from the brine. 

Brine for Cucumbers. — To six parts of water use one part salt, and 
bne part of cider vinegar. Keep the pickles well under the brine, and 
they will keep longer and be more brittle than when laid down in salt, 
ih the old way. 

Pickle for Cucumbers. — One-half ounce of black pepper, one and 
one-half ounce of ginger, one ounce of allspice, one ounce of cloves, 
one ounce of mustard seed, three-fourths of a pound of salt, half a tea- 
spoon cayenne pepper, one ounce ground mustard, one ounce turmeric, 
and six quarts of vinegar. The spices are to be scalded in the vinegar, 
except the mustard and turmeric which should be added when the 
vinegar is cold. For a good pickle without mustard : Put a teacupful 
of salt and a tablespoonful of powdered alum into a gallon of vinegar. 
Pick small cucumbers and pour a weak brine over them, boiling hot. 
Let stand over night ; drain, and put into prepared vinegar. Add cu- 
cumbers as convenient, and when as many have been put into the vinegar 
as it will cover scald them up, and put into fresh vinegar, to which has 
been added a little red pepper and horseradish. 

Canned Cucumbers, — Cucumbers canned as folfows will keep until 
the following June, and are excellent to serve with meat or salad : 
Peel and slice thin medium-sized cucumbers, sprinkle with salt and a 
little alum; let stand two hours; drain and put in jars, adding vinegar 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 161 

enough to cover, pepper and a few whole mustard seeds, the quantity of 
pepper to be governed by the taste, and the whole pepper to be used 
in preference to the ground. On top of the jar, when ready for seal- 
ing, add a dessertspoonful of olive oil. 

Chopped Cucumber Relish. — This is simple and very excellent. Pare 
and chop fine half a peck of medium-sized cucumbers; chop two medium- 
sized onions. Salt each separately over night, using one-third of a cup 
of salt in all. Drain thoroughly the next morning and mix. If the 
mixture seems too salty cover with cold water and drain a second time. 
Then put into a granite kettle, add a rounding tablespoonful each of 
celery seed and mustard seed, a level tablespoonful of ground mustard, 
one-eighth of a teaspoon of cayenne pepper, half a cup of brown 
sugar and a pint of best vinegar. Boil 10 minutes, then bottle and seal. 
Dill Pickles. — Make a brine strong enough to bear an egg, then add 
half as much more water as you have brine. Wash cucumbers in cold 
water, and into a stone, jar put first a layer of cucumbers, then a layer 
of grape leaves and a layer of dill, using leaves and stems. Continue 
in this way until the jar is full. Pour the brine over all and cover, first 
with a cloth, then with a plate, and put a weight on top of the plate. 
The cloth must be washed frequently as in making sauerkraut. 

Gherkins. — Wipe one quart of small unripe cucumbers. Put in a 
stone crock and add one-quarter cupful of salt dissolved in one pint 
of boiling water. Let stand three days. Drain cucumbers from brine, 
bring the brine to the boiling point, pour over the cucumbers, and again 
let stand three days. Repeat; drain, wipe cucumbers, and pour over 
one quart of boiling water in which one scant teaspoonful of alum has 
been dissolved. Let stand six hours, then drain from alum water. 
Cook cucumbers 10 minutes, a few at a time, in one-fourth of the fol- 
lowing mixture, heated to the boiling point and boiled 10 minutes : One 
quart of vinegar, one red pepper, one-half stick of cinnamon, one-half 
teaspoonful allspice, one-half tablespoonful of cloves. Strain the re- 
maining liquor over the pickles, which have been put in a stone jar. 
Bring liquor to boiling point before turning it over the pickles. 

Grated Cucumber Pickles. — Take cucumbers fully grown, pare them, 
and if the seeds are large remove them, then grate and drain through 
a colander, and to the pulp left add as much vinegar as there is juice, 
and can. 

Cucumber Mustard Pickles. — To every gallon of water add two pints 
of fine salt, heat scalding hot and pour over the cucumbers. Let stand 
24 hours, pour off the brine. Heat sufficient vinegar to cover them. 
To every gallon of vinegar add one tablespoonful pulverized alum, pour 
over the cucumbers and cover tight to steam. Put on fresh cabbage 



168 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

leaves every other day for a week; heat the vinegar again, put back on 
1 ucumbers and let stand two or three days. Then take fresh vinegar; 
to every gallon put one teaspoonful of -red pepper, one of black pepper, 
one ounce cinnamon sticks, two ounces white mustard seed, one small 
piece ginger root, a small handful of horseradish root, one teaspoonful 
of cloves. Boil the spices in a bag, then pour over pickles. These will 
keep crisp and nice indefinitely if kept under the vinegar, or may be 
bottled and sealed if preferred. 

Oiled Cucumber Pickles. — Pare and slice the cucumbers as for serving. 
For 50 medium-sized ones (these are best, because the seeds are not 
large) make a dressing of one cupful of olive oil, half a cupful of white 
mustard seed, half a cupful of black mustard seed, one tablespoonful 
of celery seed and one quart of vinegar. No cooking is required. Sprin- 
kle the sliced cucumbers with salt, and let them stand over night. In 
the morning drain them thoroughly and cover with the dressing in a 
stone jar. A pint of onions sliced thin may be added. It so, the onions 
should be arranged in alternate layers with the sliced cucumbers and 
salt. Place a weight over the top, let the mixture stand over night, 
and drain as before. 

Quick Pickles. — Gather small cucumbers, wash, and rub off the 
prickles. Pack in a two-quart glass jar, put a tablespoonful of salt on 
top, shaking it down, fill with cold water, put the cover on, and set 
away 24 hours. Then pour off the brine, rinse the cucumbers, and fill 
the jar with cold vinegar. Screw the top on tight, and store in cellar. 
If the vinegar looks white in a few months' time pour a little off the 
top, and fill up with fresh. These pickles are very good, though ex- 
tremely sour. 

Quick Mustard Pickles. — Put a gallon of vinegar and one cupful, 
each, of salt and mustard into a two gallon crock; pick small, quickly 
grown cucumbers ; rub off the black specks, and put into vinegar. In 
a few days the pickles are ready for use. Some people add a cup of 
sugar and one of grated horseradish to the above recipe, but it is a 
matter of taste, as neither is necessary to the keeping quality of the 
pickles. Each time cucumbers are added to those in the crock all should 
be well stirred up from the bottom. It is a good plan to put a quart 
of vinegar with its proper proportion of salt and mustard into a two- 
quart glass can, and fill in cucumbers for immediate use. 

Ripe Cucumber Pickles.- — Peel and cut ripe cucumbers in rings, 
sprinkle salt on them and let remain over night. Drain off, and cover 
with hot spiced vinegar. 

Salting Cucumbers for Winter. — Secure a small keg and if you have 
cucumbers in your garden gather every other day. Place a layer of 
coarse salt — ice cream salt— in the bottom of the keg, add a cup of water 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 163 

and cover with the cucumbers you have gathered and washed; sprinkle 
over salt to cover. Repeat this as you gather cucumbers from day to 
day, not, however, adding any more water, as the salt should make suf- 
ficient brine. If there should not be brine to cover them you may add 
a little, cautiously. There should always be a layer of salt in the bot- 
tom of the keg undissolved. When you have gathered all the cucumbers 
you wish put two or three fresh horseradish leaves on the top, and if 
you wish you may place a stone on the top to keep the cucumbers under 
the brine. When desired to make pickles take from the brine as many 
as you wish into a stone jar and cover them with boiling water; let 
them stand 24 hours ; drain and cover again with boiling water ; let 
stand till next day. If you desire them very fresh you may repeat this 
the third time. It is not always necessary. Then pour off the water 
and. drain well. To every three quarts of cucumbers take one quart of 
best cider vinegar. To each gallon of vinegar take one teaspoonful 
each of whole cloves, allspice, peppercorns, mace, celery seed and two 
teaspoonfuls of mustard seed. Tie these in a little muslin or cheese- 
cloth bag. (The spices, if scattered through the cucumbers, turn them 
dark.) Add to vinegar two pieces of ginger-root an inch long and' 
two tiny red pepper pods, same size. Boil vinegar with spices for one 
minute and pour over the cucumbers. If not enough vinegar to cover, 
add more boiling hot to fill jar. These need not be sealed. Place a 
horseradish leaf on the top of jar; are ready for use in a few days. 
Will keep indefinitely. 

Small cucumber pickles are prepared as follows : Wash and wipe ; 
place in jars, and cover with boiling brine, strong enough to bear an egg. 
Let stand 24 hours; pour off the brine, wipe, and place in clean jars. 
Cover with hot vinegar, spiced in the proportion of one onion, 12 whole 
cloves, one ounce of mustard seed and three blades of mace to 100 cu- 
cumbers. They will be ready to use in two weeks. 

Sour Cucumber Pickles. — Dissolve one pint of salt in one gallon of 
vinegar; wash the cucumbers and pour over them some boiling water, 
let stand five or ten minutes, then pack closely in cans, pour over the 
salted vinegar and seal. The friend who sends this recipe says the 
pickles are very crisp and nice, and will keep as long as you will let 
them. 

Spiced Cucumber Pickles.— Prepar vinegar for pickles as follows: 
One gallon vinegar, four ounces salt, two ounces cloves, two ounces 
cinnamon, one ounce allspice, one ounce ginger root, one ounce yellow 
mustard seed, one ounce celery seed, small piece of alum. Scald all 
together. This will keep for years. Wash the cucumbers and drain 
until dry, then put them into the vinegar at any time after it is cold. 



164 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

If the vinegar is very sharp add a little water to it before scalding the 
ingredients together, or the pickles will shrivel. 

Sweet Cucumber Pickles. — Let the cucumbers stand in salt water 
three days. Heat the brine once or twice and pour over them. Drain ; 
put in a jar and pour over them hot vinegar with cloves and cinnamon 
in a bag; two-thirds cupful sugar to quart of vinegar; put in pletity 
of horseradish and this will keep sealed or open. Put in a little alum 
to make them brittle. 

Boiled Sweet Cucumber Pickle. — Put cucumbers in cold weak brine 
(V/2 cup salt to one gallon water) one day and night. Take out, dry 
on cloth. To one gallon vinegar add two cups sugar, nearly one ounce 
mixed spice. Heat these all boiling hot. Put in pickles and let boil 
up once. Put in cans immediately and pour the hot vinegar over them. 
They are nice and sweet, and will keep a long time, till eaten. These 
will not shrivel if you follow directions. One gallon vinegar will cover 
two gallons cucumbers. 

Steamed Sweet Cucumber Pickle. — Peel, steam as soft as liked and 
let stand over night in a weak brine. Next morning drain, put on 
vinegar enough to cover, and let stand over night. Again in the morn- 
ing drain off the liquid part. Now take one pint of fresh vinegar, three 
pounds of sugar and one ciince of cassia buds (no other spices). When 
this comes to the boiling point put in the cucumbers, let scald up and then 
pack away in stone jars. 

Tested Cucumber Pickles. — Wash and fill two-quart can with freshly 
picked cucumbers of any desired size. Add to them two heaping table- 
spoonfuls dry mustard; two heaping tablespoonfuls salt, and fill can 
with good cold cider vinegar. It doesn't matter whether you have an 
airtight top or not; ,a cork with cloth tied over, or put in crock. If 
you like more mustard or salt it will do no harm. 

Pickles Without Cooking. — One cupful of sugar, one cupful', salt, one 
goodsized root of horseradish, one tablespoonful alum, one tablespoonful 
white mustard seed, one gallon vinegar, mixed spice to taste. Boil the 
above ingredients. Then allow the prepared vinegar to become cold 
before putting in the cucumbers. Use the smallest pickles, as the large 
ones do not always become thoroughly pickled, but for the small ones 
this way of preparing them is excellent. 

Spiced Currants. — Make a syrup of three pounds of sugar, one pint 
of vinegar and water, half ?nd half, two tablespoonfuls of cinnamon, 
one tablespoonful of cloves, half a teaspoonful of salt; add six pounds 
of washed, stemmed currants and boil half an hour. Seal in jars. 

Pickled Damsons. — This is a sweet pickle, and very good served 
w^ith mutton or venison. Ingredients required: Three pounds damsons, 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 185 

one quart of vinegar, three pounds moist sugar, one-half ounce cinna- 
mon, three blades of mace, one-quarter ounce allspice. The pluihs 
should be ripe, but not too much so; the bloom is rubbed off with a 
piece of flannel or a clean cloth, and they are pricked a little with a 
needle. The vinegar, sugar and spices are boiled together for 10 min- 
utes, then strained and poured over the fruit, in a large basin Next 
day the vinegar is boiled again, and again poured over the damsons, 
and on the third day the damsons themselves are simmered in the 
vinegar for exactly five minutes. They should be tied down while hot. 
A quicker method of pickling either plums or damsons is the following: 
Remove the stalks from the fruit ; wipe it and arrange in layers in a 
jar with good brown sugar sprinkled between. Fill up the jars with 
cold vinegar, tie them down and bake in rather a slow oven till the 
plums are tender, then tie down for use. 

French Mustard. — Take six ounces of salt, four ounces of scraped 
horseradish, one clove of garlic, and two quarts of boiling vinegar; 
steep these together in a covered vessel for six hours, then strain and 
add mustard to the spiced vinegar sufficient to make it the proper con- 
sistency. These proportions are large; they can be reduced if necessary, 
but the mustard will keep a long time, as it is made with boiling vinegar. 

Gillespie Relish. — Ore peck ripe tomatoes, two cupfuls celery, six 
large onions, seven red peppers. Run the peeled tomatoes and the 
onions through a meat grinder. Chop the celery and the peppers fine. 
Add two ounces of mustard seed and ground cinnamon, one-half cupful 
of salt, three pints cider vinegar and two pounds of light brown sugar. 
Mix and seal. Do not cook. It is claimed that this will keep per- 
fectly for five years, and it is very appetizing and universally liked. 

Hebrew Pickle. — For a pint of pickles grate two roots of horse- 
radish. Mix with it two tablespoonfuls of celery seed, three tablespoon- 
fuls of mustard seed, four tablespoonfuls of sugar and one tablespoonful 
of turmeric. Cover the ingredients with scalding hot vinegar. Seal in 
glass jars. Let stand one week before using. 

India Relish. — This recipe calls for gherkins, large cucumbers, small 
onions, cabbage and red peppers. Green nasturtium seeds may be added. 
Cut the vegetables all into small pieces and put the mixture, layer by 
layer, into a stone jar, separating the layers with salt. Sprinkle the top 
well with salt, cover with a plate weighted with a flatiron, stone or 
brick, and let the jar and contents stand for three days. At the end of 
that time drain off the liquid and rinse the vegetables thoroughly in 
cold water. Then cover with fresh cold water and leave for 36 hours. 
In tlie meantime scald three-quarters of a gallon of cider vinegar with 
half a tablespoonful each of celery seed, paprika, cloves, mace, ground 
mustard and ~ horseradish and two tablespoonfuls of curry. Add one 



166 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

and three-quarters cupful of brown sugar. Turn the vinegar over the 
drained vegetables and cook for a quarter of an hour. Put the relish 
into a stone jar and leave it for two or three days. Then drain off the 
vinegar, scald it and pour it while hot over the vegetables. Let it 
stand until the next day, then fill into small jars, cover closely and 
keep in a cool dark place. 

India Relish No. 2. — This comes from the South. Two pounds of 
citron melon or watermelon rind, two heads of cabbage, white and firm; 
six white onions, one large cupful of sugar, one heaping teaspoonful 
each of ground cinnamon, mace, paprika (Hungarian sweet pepper), 
mustard and powdered alum, one tablespoonful of curry powder, one 
quart of vinegar, two tablespoonfuls of celery seed, one tablespoonful 
of salt. Prepare the melon by cutting off the green rind and scraping 
away the softer inner coating, leaving less than an inch firm and white. 
Cut into thin strips, put into a porcelain-lined ■ kettle, cover with cold 
water and sprinkle a tablespoonful of powdered alum over it. Cover 
closely and cook gently for three hours. Drain well and cover with 
ice water. Change the water twice in four hours, and then wipe the 
melon dry. Cut the cabbage into quarters, cook in boiling water slightly 
salted for fifteen minutes. Let it get perfectly cold. Parboil the 
onionSj and allow them also to get cold and stiff. Now chop cabbage, 
melons and onions sepasately and very fine. Mix all together in a large 
crock and pour over them the scalding hot vinegar, in which have been 
boiled for one minute the spices, sugar and celery seed. Leave the 
crock covered 24 hours. Strain off the vinegar, bring it to a boil and 
pour again over the mixture in the crock. Repeat this for three days 
in succession, after which pack in small jars, cover closely and set away 
to ripen. It will be ready for use in six weeks, but improves by keeping. 

Pickled Mangoes.— Young musk, or nutmeg melons are needed for 
the purpose. Through a slit in the side of the melon extract all the 
seeds with the fingers without breaking the fruit. In case the patience 
gives out, a plug can be cut out, saved and replaced, but it is better to 
make only the slit. Keep the melons in strong brine for three days, 
then drain them and let them remain in pure water for 24 hours. Heat 
slowly in vinegar, in which alum has been dissolved, until the melons are 
green. For a gallon of vinegar a piece of alum half the size of a 
hickorynut will be wanted. The following is the recipe for the stuf- 
fing, given in an old cook book: One handful of horseradish scraped; 
two handfnls of English mustard seed, two teaspoonfuls of chopped 
garlic, one teaspoonful of ground nutmeg and mace, one dozen whole 
peppercorns, one teaspoonful of ground ginger, half a tablespoonful of 
ground mustard, one teaspoonful of sugar, one teaspoonful of celery 
seed and one tablespoonful of olive oil. Fill the greened mangoes 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 167 

through the slit with the mixture. Sew up the slit, or tie the melon 
securely so that it will not open. Pack the mangoes in a big stone jar 
and pour scalding vinegar over them. After two days, drain off the 
vinegar, scald and return it to the jar, and repeat twice at intervals 
of two days. The mangoes will be ready for use in four or five 
months. 

Minced Pickle. — Chop half a peck of green tomatoes, cover them with 
two-thir'ds of a cupful of salt and let them stand for a day and a 
night. Then scald half a gallon of vinegar with a tablespoonful of 
pepper, a tablespoonful and a half each of ground mustard, allspice, 
cinnamon and cloves and half a cupful of white mustard seed. Add to 
the tomatoes two onions chopped fine and four large green peppers de- 
nuded of seeds and cut into rings. Turn the vinegar over the mixture 
and boil steadily 20 minutes; then bottle. 

Mixed Pickle. — Three bundled small cucumbers, two heads of cauli- 
flower, one of cabbage, six green peppers with seeds taken out, three 
quarts small onions and two quarts small beans. Cut the cabbage and 
the cauliflower in small pieces, and put all in a brine strong enough to 
bear up an egg. Let them remain 24 hours, then rinse and drain thor- 
oughly. Place on the stove two gallons of vinegar, add a large root 
of horseradish, grated, two ounces each of mustard seed and black pep- 
per, one teaspoon cayenne, and one ounce of turmeric. Let it boil and 
pour over pickles in a jar. When cold mix in one cupful of mustard 
wet with cold vinegar. 

Mixed Pickle No. 3. — One-half medium-sized head of cabbage, four 
celery roots, four tablespoonfuls grated horseradish, six large green 
tomatoes, one large or two small Spanish onions, 15^ quart of vinegar, 
one-fourth teaspoonful of powdered alum. Chop all the vegetables and 
mix them together. Put a layer about two inches thick in the bottom 
of a jar, sprinkle it with a tablespoonful of salt, then another layer of 
vegetables and salt, and so on until all is used. Allow it to stand 24 
hours, then drain, and press out all the liquor; cover with boiling 
water, allow it to stand 10 minutes, then press with the hands until 
entirely dry. Add to one quart of vinegar % teaspoonful of alum, and 
stir until dissolved. Put a layer of the pickles two inches thick in the 
bottom of a jar, sprinkle with mustard seed, black pepper, and the 
grated horseradish ; then another layer of pickle, and so on until used. 
Pour the vinegar over, let it stand two days, and it is ready for use. 

Mock Olives. — Two quarts of green plums, lyi tablespoonful mus- 
tard seed, zyi tablespoonfuls salt, two quarts vinegar. Place the plums 
in a stone jar with mustard seed and salt; turn the vinegar into a pre- 
serving kettle, bring to a boil and pour over plums. Cover closely. 



168 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Next day drain off the vinegar, bring again to a boil ' and pour over 
plums while hot. If plums are large repeat the third morning. When 
cold place all in olive bottles and cork tightly. They will taste like 
real olives. 

Muskinelon Pickles. — Pare the rind off ripe, spicy, green melons, re- 
move the seeds and cut into thick slices. Weigh as for peaches, seven 
pounds of fruit to three and one-quarter pounds of sugar, and put the 
sugar to cook with water enough to dissolve it. Boil and skim it until 
clear, then pour it over the melon in a crock. Repeat this for three 
mornings, but on the third morning add a cupful of vinegar to each 
three pints of syrup and boil it up with a cupful of spices in a bag. 
Pour it over the melon in jars and seal at once. 

Mustard Pickles. — Two quarts . small cucumbers, one quart - small 
onions, one quart green tomatoes, one large cauliflower, six green pep- 
pers, quartered. Lay in weak brine twenty-four hours, then scald in 
same water and drain. Paste — six tablespoonfuls English mustard, one 
tablespoonful tumeric, one and one-half cup of sugar, one small cup 
of flour, two quarts best cider vinegar. Mix dry ingredients thor- 
oughly, add vinegar, boil a few minutes, pour over pickles and bottle. 

Mustard Pickles No. 2. — This differs from mq.st recipes for this 
pickle in being made without green tomato. Put one-half peck smaill 
cucumbers, two quarts silver skinned onions, and two heads of picked 
cauliflower to soak in water to cover and a cupful of salt over night. In 
the morning' drain; mix one dessertspoonful of turmeric powder with 
three-quarters of a pound of the best mustard;' wet with sufficient 
vinegar to mix without lumps. Put three quarts of vinegar over the 
fire, add five cents' worth of mixed pickling spices, one-half ounce 
celery seed, one-half ounce v/hite mustard seed, one teaspoonful each 
of cinnamon and cloves, one pound of brown sugar, carefully stir in 
the mustard and turmeric paste and let boil up well ; then add the 
mixed pickles, two red peppers chopped with the seeds of same, and 
stir all together. After it begins to bubble let boil well for five minutes. 

Mustard Pickles No. 3. — Equal quantities of cucumbers, celery, cauli- 
flower and small button onions. Cut all in small pieces except the 
onions. Cover with strongly-salted water for 24 hours ; drain, put into 
a jar, and pour on hot vinegar (not too strong) sufficient to cover. Let 
the pickles stand three days, and then drain. To five quarts of the 
pickle lise three quarts of cider vinegar, one cupful of sugar, and two 
tablespoonfuls of butter. Heat to boiling, then stirring constantly (for 
fear of burning) add cne cupful of flour, six tablespoonfuls of ground 
mustard and one-half ounce of turmeric powder wetted in cold vinegar. 
Stir till smooth, and pour over the pickle while hot; stir well. When 
cold cover close. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 1G9 

Sliced Mustard Pickles. — One dozen large cucumbers sliced, two 
dozen very small cucumbers, one quart of small onions, one large cauli- 
flower, steamed slightly. Soak all these ingredients in cold brine over 
night. Paste for the pickles is made as follows: One-half pound of 
ground yellow mustard, one tcacupful of flour, one teacupful of sugar, 
one-half ounce of turmeric. Rub the above ingredients together with a 
little vinegar until smooth. Then add three quarts of vinegar, letting 
it scald until a thick paste. Next add one-half ounce of celery seed, 
and pour the hot paste over the- pickles, put in cans and seal. 

Nasturtium Pods Pickled. — Put the pods to soak in weak brine 
for two days, then in fresh water one day; drain, put in a jar, and 
cover with boiling vinegar. The vinegar m.ay be spiced if desired, but 
if the pods are to be used in sauce they are better unspiced. 

Pickled Onions. — First pour boiling water over the onions to loosen 
the skins. As soon as cool enough to handle begin to peel, dropping 
the onions as peeled into salt water (not brine) to prevent their being 
discolored. Make a strong brine, heat to the boiling point, and pour 
over the onions. Leave them in the brine 48 hours, then drain. Spice 
vinegar according to taste, heat 1o boiling point, and pour over the 
onions. Set away for two or three days, drain off the vinegar, heat it 
again, and pour it over the onions in the jars in which they are to be 
stored; tie up the jars and set away. 

Pickled Peaches. — For pickling select medium-sized peaches, ripe and 
firm. Rub off the down with a piece of flannel. To eight pounds of 
fruit use four pounds of granulated sugar, one quart of vinegar, two 
ounces of stick cinnamon. Boil the sugar, vinegar and cinnamon for five 
minutes. Then put in the peaches carefully, a few at a time. If one 
likes cloves, two or three may be stuck in each peach. When the 
peaches arc done enough to be easily pricked with a fork, take them out 
and put in the jar. When the peaches are all cooked boil the syrup 
till a little thick, pour over peaches and seal cans or jars. 

Sweet Pickled Peaches. — Cut the peaches in two, remove the stones, 
and close. the openings with halves together, pack in jars, and cover with 
the following liquid: To two pounds of sugar add one pint of vinegar 
(best cider vinegar alone should be used for all pickles), tie in a bag 
a teaspoonful of whole cloves, one-half teaspoonful cassia buds, three 
sticks of cinnamon (broken) and some tiny bits of ginger, allspice and 
nutmeg (about a teaspoonful in all). Scald three times and seal the 
jars. Keep in dark, dry place ; when ready to use remove the spice. 

Sweet Pickled Pears. — Select ripe but firm fruit, peel and measure 
out for every seven pounds of fruit four of white sugar, one pint of soft 
vinegar and half a tablespoonful each of whole cloves, whole allspice 



170 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

and cinnamon sticks. Put the pears in a kettle and over each layer 
sprinkle sugar until both are exhausted. Heat slowly until the boiling 
point is reached, then add the vinegar and spice and boil five minutes. 
Take out the fruit with a perforated skimmer and spread upon platters 
to cool. Boil the syrup till thick. Heat the jars, pack in the pears 
and pour the syrup over boiling hot; seal. 

Pepper Hash. — Wash and dry five large green peppers and one red 
one, remove seeds and chop shells quite fine; chop fine a good-sized 
cabbage, and place with the peppers in a bowl, mixing well. Add two 
tablespoonfuls of brown mustard seed, three tablespoonfuls of salt and 
enough good cider vinegar to cover the whole. Stir well together and 
put into pickle bottles. Ready for use in two days, or will keep for 
Winter use. 

Pepper Mangoes. — Two dozen full-grown pods of red pepper. Cut 
out the stems with a sharp knife and scrape out the seeds. Lay the pods 
in brine and let soak for 24 hours. Drain. Make a dressing of finely 
chopped cabbage, enough to fill the peppers, seasoned with one table- 
spoonful each of salt and pulverized mustard seed, one teaspoonful of 
grated horseradish, one teaspoonful of black pepper and one tablespoon- 
ful of made mustard. When well mixed stuff the peppers, sew the 
stems on with a coarse thread, pack in a stone jar, cover with strong 
vinegar and let stand two weeks before using. 

Pickled Peppers. — Put two dozen green peppers in a bowl and pour 
over them a very strong brine. Put a weight over them to keep them 
under the water and let them lie for two days. Drain them, make a 
small incision in the side of each to let out the water, wipe them with 
a soft cloth and put them in a stone jar, with one-half ounce of whole 
allspice, one-half ounce of whole cloves and a small lump of alum. Pour 
cold vinegar over them and tie a bladder securely over the jar. Pickled 
in this way the peppers should preserve their color. 

Pepper Relish. — Remove the seeds from six large green peppers and 
one red bell pepper, and chop the peppers fine. Mix the peppers with 
a finely minced head of cabbage. Turn in a little less than a quarter 
of a cupful of salt, a full cupful of sugar, two tablespoonfuls of mu!*- 
tard seed and nice cider vinegar enough to cover the mixture. Stir 
thoroughly and bottle. 

Piccalilli. — Two pecks of green tomatoes, two heads of white cab- 
bage, 13 large onions, four green peppers, two red peppers, one good 
root of horseradish (grated), one tablespoonful each of cinnamon, nut- 
meg and allspice. Chop all fine, stir in two cups of salt and let stand 
all night, then drain; cover with cold vinegar, boil 10 minutes and drain 
again. Cover with vinegar, add the spices and three pounds of brown 
sugar. Boil a few minutes and put away in jars. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 171 

Canned Pimentos. — These are simply red peppers, the long, tapering, 
sharp-pointed sweet variety. They repay one for the trouble, as they 
retail at 15 cents a can, and in glass jars at 35 cents per quart. Select 
ripe red ones, neither dry nor woody. Cut off stem end and extract the 
seeds. Drop in a jar and cover with brine that will float an egg. Let 
stand three days. Wash in several waters, cover with clear water one 
day, then drain well. Place peppers in cans, fill to overflowing with 
boiling water, add a level tablespoonful of salt to each quart of water; 
place in a boiler on two-inch layer of straw, weight cans to prevent 
tipping, pour in boiling water to cover two-thirds of the can, screw 
lids on loosely and cover the boiler. When the water boils simmer 10 
minutes, remove and seal. They are used in salads, as a relish with 
cold meats or are stuffed with rice, macaroni or bread crumbs. 

Pumpkin Pickle. — This is very good when there is a scarcity of 
apples. Pare the pumpkins carefully, leaving out all soft or stringy 
parts, then cut into pieces about one or two inches square. Soak over 
night in vinegar, salt and water, just enough vinegar and salt to make 
a good flavor. The next day make a pickle as you would for any nice 
pickle and let them simmer on the back of the stove for a long timra 
without stirring. Our rule for pickle is seven pounds fruit, four pounds 
sugar and one pint of vinegar. We usually flavor the pumpkin pickle 
with either sliced lemon or ginger root. 

Quince Sweet Pickles. — Scrub with a small vegetable brush to re- 
move the down, wipe dry and cut out any spots or decayed portions. 
Slice, without paring, into rounds a fourth of an inch thick, leaving in 
both core and seeds, unless imperfect, then weigh, Put the fruit, a 
thin layer at a time, in a steamer or colander over boiling water, cover 
closely and steam until it is perfectly tender, then place in a stone 
jar. Make the syrup of four pounds of sugar, a pint of vinegar of 
medium strength, a pint of the water over which the fruit was steamed. 
an ounce of stick cinnamon, a heaping tablespoonful of allspice berries 
and a level tablespoonful of whole cloves to seven pounds of the fruit. 
Pour over the fruit, cover securely and stand in a cool place over 
night. The next morning drain off the syrup, boil for 10 minutes with 
the spice bag, skim and pour again boiling hot over the fruit. Continue 
this process for three successive mornings. The last morning add the 
fruit to the syrup and spices and boil gently until heated through, then 
skim out and put into the crock. Continue to boil the syrup until it is 
as thick as molasses. If, after the second boiling, it does not seem 
spiced sufficiently, add more spices tied in a fresh bag. When the syrup 
is done, reheat the quinces in it, then fill into self-sealing glass jars as 
in canning. 

Red Cabbage Pickle. — Cut a red cabbage of good size into six pieces, 



172 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

sprinjcle it with salt and leave it for a day and a night. Then drain off 
the liquid, rinse it with cold water and let it soak in fresh cold water. 
Scald half a gallon of vinegar with a dozen whole cloves and white pep- 
pers and a few blades of mace broken fine. Turn in half a cupful of 
sugar and two or three tablespoonfuls of celery seed. Cook slowly for 
a quarter of an hour. Have the cabbage, drained and dried, packed into 
a stgne jar. Turn the hot vinegar over it and put it in a cool place. 
The cabbage will be at its best in two months. 

Spanish Sauce. — One peck green tomatoes, one quart onions, six 
large sweet peppers, four quarts ripe tomatoes, two heads celery chopped 
fine, two pounds brown sugar, one gallon vinegar, one teaspoonful 
cayenne pepper, three tablespoonfuls cinnamon, one tablespoonful each 
of allspice, mace and cloves. Chop green tomatoes, onions and seeded 
peppers, salt and let stand over night. In the morning strain through 
a cloth until perfectly dry. Then mix all the ingredients and boil until 
tender. . 

Tomato Conserve. — Cut five large sound tomatoes into pieces and 
cook them until they are tender, with two onions in which three or 
four cloves have been stuck, two bay leaves and salt and pepper to 
taste. Then turn the fruit on to a fine sieve placed over a bowl and 
drain off the juice. Boil the juice until it has been half reduced. Next 
remove the onions and bay leaves from the tomatoes left on the sieve 
and press the pulp through the fine meshes. Add to it the juice, put 
the mixture into wide mouthed bottles; cover them loosely and stand 
them in a kettle of warm water (it should be about their own tem- 
perature). Bring the water to a boil and boil for half an hour. Leave 
the bottles in the kettle until they are cool, then tighten their covers 
and set them in the dark. 

Egg Tomatoes in Sweet Pickle. — Pour scalding water over seven 
pounds of the egg tomatoes, let them stand for a moment, then remove 
the skin. Cover them with vinegar much diluted with water and let 
them stand 12 hours. Put one-half cupful of weak vinegar in the pre- 
serving kettle and add part of the tomatoes, then some sugar and any 
whole spices, such as ginger, allspice, cinnamon, cloves and mace, using 
these or even more varieties according to taste. Add more of the to- 
matoes, more sugar and more spices, alternating the layers thus until 
all the tomatoes and five pounds of sugar have been used. Cook very 
gently, stirring just enough to prevent scorching without breaking the 
tomatoes. When these are quite clear and transparent, remove them 
carefully and boil down the syrup. When the syrup is thick strain it 
and add the tomatoes. Boil up once and pour into pint jars to be sealed 
at once. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. ' 173 

French Sweet Pickle. — One peck green tomatoes chopped and six 
large onions sliced. Salt them and let stand over night. Then drain off 
the watery part and cover with vinegar, add two teaspoons of baking 
soda dissolved in a little water, and let the whole boil for 15 minutes. 
Take two pounds of brown sugar, two ounces of cinnamon, one ounce 
of ground cloves and one-half pound of white mustard seed and mix 
dry. Put this in the kettle with three quarts of vinegar. Once more 
drain the tomato of its liquid part, add it to the spice and vinegar and 
cook for an hour. 

Green Tomato Chili Sauce. — Slice the green tomatoes and salt down 
as you do egg plant, put a weight on them and let stand until morn- 
ing, then rinse in cold water to take out the salt and wash out the seeds 
and bitter juice of the green tomato. For 12 tomatoes take four sweet 
green peppers, half dozen chili peppers, one large onion, one cupful 
vinegar, ,one tablespoonful sugar, two teaspoonfuls of salt, one of pep- 
per, two of ground allspice, half teaspoonful of mace, one of cinnamon, 
one of cloves. Chop the tomatoes fine, boil 20 minutes, strain and press 
through a sieve. Chop the peppers and onions very fine, first taking out 
the seeds of the peppers. Boil all together for 10 minutes ; add spices, 
then bottle and seal. 

Green Tomato Chow Chow. — Chop fine one peck of green tomatoes, 
three onions, six green peppers; sprinkle them lightly with salt, let stand 
an hour, then scald in the juices. Put three quarts of vinegar in a 
porcelain-lined kettle with one pint of sugar and a few pieces of horse- 
radish root. Boil for five minutes, add the tomatoes and boil five 
minutes longer, put into stone jars, cover and set in cool, dry place. 
Whole cloves, mace and stick cinnamon may be added to this if you want 
a spiced pickle. 

Easy Green Tomato Pickle. — Slice the tomatoes and allow them to 
stand in weak salt brine over night. In the morning rinse and pack 
directly in fruit jars. Place the jars uncovered in the steamer and steam 
for about two hours. Have ready at the end of that time a sweet-spiced 
vinegar made exactly as you do for pickling peaches, and after draining 
all the juice that cooks from the sliced tomatoes, fill the cans brim-full 
with it and seal as in canning anything. 

Green Tomato Sweet Pickle. — Wash the tomatoes and let drain, then 
slice into a large earthen dish, sprinkling salt between the layers. Let 
stand till next day. Pour off the brine and juice, rinse off with clear 
water, let the fruit drain, then weigh if you like to follow the exact 
rule. To a syrup made of brown sugar and a little water add ginger 
root, cloves and cinnamon bark. Also tie up two or three little bags of 
mixed, ground spices to cook with the rest. Add the tomato and a 
handful of nasturtium seeds, and cook till the tomato seems tender. 



174 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

The nasturtium seeds should be not more than half grown, green, and 
if in clusters, so much the better. Skim out the tomato into a stone 
jar, add a liberal quantity of vinegar to the juice left in the kettle, and 
when it boils up pour over the contents of the jar. 

Green Tomato Mangoes. — Select smooth tomatoes of good shape 
and showing no signs of ripening. Cut across one-fourth of the length 
below the stem and carefully extract the seeds and pulp. Have ready 
a filling composed of two parts finely chopped cabbage and one part 
onions, also chopped fine, and season to taste with celery and mustard 
seeds, pepper and sugar. Fill the tomato shells as full as possible and 
tie the tops firmly on with strong cord. Let the mangoes lie over night 
in very strong brine, then soak them for 24 hours in weak vinegar. 
Pack in a stone jar, leaving plenty of space above them, and fill the jar 
with three parts vinegar to one part water, sweetened to the taste. 
These mangoes may be made either sweet or sour as preferred. A few 
pieces of horseradish root will season and preserve the vinegar. 

Tomato soy is made with both green and ripe fruit. The following 
is an excellent tested recipe for ripe tomato s.oy: Peel and chop a 
peck of ripe tomatoes until they are quite fine. Then put them upon 
the fire in a preserving kettle with a half a teacupful of whole cloves ; 
the same quantity of whole allspice; a scant teacupful of salt; a table- 
spoonful of black pepper, and three red pepper and five onions, all of 
which have been chopped fine. Let the ingredients boil together for fully 
an hour, and immediately add a quart of the best cider vinegar. When 
the soy has cooled sufficiently, it may be bottled. 

Green Tomato Soy. — One peck green tomatoes; one quart onions, salt 
and vinegar as desired ; one teaspoonf ul ground cloves ; one tea- 
spoonful ginger; one teaspoonf ul cinnamon; the same of black pepper; 
y2 teaspoonful red pepper; \^ pound brown sugar; half a grated nut- 
meg. Wash the tomatoes and cut in slices, also the onions. Place a 
layer of tomatoes and then sprinkle with salt, next a layer of onions in 
the same way — ^until all are done. Let stand over night. In the morn- 
ing drain well and then put on the stove to cook, covering the prepara- 
tion with vinegar. Add the spices and let it boil slowly together four 
or five hours; then bottle hot, leaving the covers off the jars till the 
next day. 

Tomato Mustard.— To one peck of ripe tomatoes add two teaspoon- 
fuls of salt and stew half an hour; then pass through a sieve. Add 
two dessertspoonfuls of finely chopped onions, one dessertspoonful each 
of whole pepper, allspice and cloves tied in a muslin bag, and half a 
teaspoonful of cayenne; simmer down one-third, then stir in a tea- 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 178 

spoonful of curry powder and a teacupful of mustard; simmer half an 
hour longer, then bottle.

of firm ripe tomatoes, peeled and chopped, one-half cupful of chopped 
celery, two tablespoonfuls of chopped red pepper, two tablespoonfuls of 
chopped onion, two tablespoonfuls of salt, three tablespoonfuls of sugar, 
three tablespoonfuls of mustard seed, one-quarter teaspoonful of cloves, 
one-half teaspoonful of cinnamon, one-half teaspoonful of grated nut- 
meg and one cupful of vinegar. Stir thoroughly, put in a stone jar and 
cover. It should stand one week before using, but may be kept one 
year. 

Green Tomato Pickle. — Slice very thinly one peck of green to- 
matoes and two quarts of onions, sprinkling them all with a little salt, 
and let them stand till next day. Now drain them through a colander, 
put them on with enough good vinegar to cover them, and boil very 
gently till clear and tender. Then drain them from the vinegar. Put 
into about the same quantity of fresh vinegar two pounds of brown 
sugar, one -half pound of white mustard seed, one-half ounce of ground 
mace, one tablespoonful each of celery seed and ground cloves, and boil 
them all together for a few minutes ; then pour it over the drained to- 
matoes, which have been previously mixed with one dessertspoonful of 
cayenne, one full teaspoonful each of ground mustard and of tur- 
meric; mix this all well together, add about half a pint of good salad 
oil, and, when cold, put it into jars. 

Sour Green Tomato Pickle. — Peel green tomatoes and to each quart 
add three small cucumbers, one pint small white onions, two green pep- 
pers, quarter of a pound of salt, and half a pound of mustard seed. 
Chop all fine, mix and set away in a jar for twenty-four hours ; then 
cover with good vinegar and place bits of horseradish root on to!p. 
Cover, but do not seal. 

Tomato Puree. — Break ripe sound tomatoes in halves and crush them 
as they heat slowly. When they are tender strain and push the pulp 
through a sieve, season with salt and pepper and turn into glass jars. 
Put the cover on loosely, stand the jars in a pan of warm water and 
boil for half an hour. Then screw the covers on firmly. Use for mak- 
ing soups or gravies. 

Spiced Tomatoes. — Put into a preserving pan four pounds of good 
red tomatoes, two pounds of brown sugar, one pint of good vinegar 
(cider vinegar if possible), and one-half ounce each of cloves and stick 
cinnamon. Stew this altogether very gently till the tomatoes are cooked, 
but not broken; then lift them out and set them aside to cool. Con- 
tinue simmering very slowly till it is as thick as syrup. When the toma- 



176 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

toes are quite cold, reheat them gently in the syrup and again lift them 
out, packing them, when perfectly cold, in jars, pouring the thick 
syrup (also quite cold) over them, and cover tight. 

Virginia Pickle. — This is uncooked. In a three-gallon jar mix one 
gallon of strong vinegar, one-half pint of salt, three pounds of brown 
sugar, two ounces each of black pepper, brown ginger, celery seed, mus- 
tard seed, mace, cloves, horseradish and allspice, one-half box of ground 
mustard, a little red pepper and one-half dozen pepper pods. Peel three 
dozen onions and put them with fresh cucumbers, just from the vine, 
washed and wiped dry, into the spiced vinegar, using enough cucumbers to 
fill the jar. Agitate the pickles every other morning for several months 
or until cool weather comes. Then add more sugar until the pickles 
have a pleasant taste. 

Pickled Walnuts. — -The walnuts must be gathered while young and 
green, and be laid in strong brine. Leave them in this for a' week, 
changing it every other day. Take them out, dry them between two 
cloths and pierce each with a large needle. Throw them into cold 
water and 'leave them several hours before packing them in small jars 
and pouring over them scalding hot seasoned vinegar, prepared in the 
following proportions : Four quarts of vinegar, one cupful of sugar, 
three dozen cloves, three dozen black peppers, 18 whole allspice and 13 
blades of mace boiled together for five minutes.

spoon mustard, one-half cup each of sugar and flour, and one-third 
teaspoon of red pepper. Pare and slice cucumbers and onions, cover 
with water, add one-half cup salt and let stand over night. In the 
morning drain the cucumbers and onions; put vinegar on the stove to 
boil, mix the spices, sugar and flour in a little cold vinegar, add to the 
boiling vinegar and let boil five minutes, stirring constantly; then put 
in cucumbers and onions, boil 15 minutes and seal in jars while hot. 

Vinegar for Yellow Pickles. — This may be used for cucumbers, to- 
matoes or any other vegetable desired. Use one-half pound of grated 
horseradish, one pound of white mustard seed, one-half pound of black 
mustard seed, one ounce each of mace, nutmegs, cloves, allspice and 
ground white pepper, two ounces of turmeric, one-half cupful of ground 
mustard, two tablespoon fuls of celery seed, four cloves of garlic, one- 
quarter pound of ground ginger and two pounds of brown sugar. Puf 
in a three-gallon jar with two gallons of vinegar. Stir frequently and let 
remain for several weeks before using. This will keep any length of 
time. Half quantity may be prepared for the use of a small family. 

Corn Vinegar. — A friend says she prefers this to cider vinegar:' 
One pint corn cut from cob; one pint of brown sugar or molasses, to

one gallon of rain water. Put in a large jar. Keep covered with a 
cloth. Set in the sun. In a month you will have good vinegar. 

Fruit Vinegars. — Among .suggestions for making vinegar given by a 
correspondent of Good Housekeeping, it is stated that half-gallon fruit 
jars are better than stone jugs to make it in, as a larger surface is 
exposed to the light and air, and by shaking often, oxygenation, souring, 
is hastened. A cloth should, of course, be tied over the top to keep out 
insects and dust. The jars should be set in the sun, and whenever the 
fluid has worked clear, strain off and leave it in a warm place until it is 
as sharp as desired. When mother forms, new vinegar can be made by 
simply adding sweetened water. Always use soft water, but if it is not 
available, boil the water and set it in the sun a day or two. To make 
vinegar from apple or peach parings, fill a jar half full of parings, add 
one-half teacup molasses, and fill up with water. Set in the sun and 
strain for use in about two weeks. Tomato vinegar is made by mashing 
and straining a quart of ripe tomatoes, putting in a jar with jOne cupful 
of sugar or molasses, then filling the jar with soft water, and keeping in 
a sunny place two weeks. In default of other material vinegar may be 
made from yeast. Dissolve half a teacupful of brown sugar in one pint 
of warm water, add one small yeast cake, and fill the jar with water. 
This must be left to work for two weeks. 

Gooseberry Vinegar. — Boil one gallon of water; when cold add three 
quarts of ripe gooseberries, mashed. Allow it to stand for four days, 
stirring every day. On the fourth day strain through a sieve to remove 
the seeds, then barrel. To eixh gallon of the liquid add V/z pound 
sugar, and one-eighth cake of compressed yeast. We used to- use barm 
(the foam from fermenting beer) which was the ordinary form of yeast 
years ago in communities where home brewing was practiced. Stir every 
day until the vinegar has done fermenting, then close the barrel. Green 
Of amber gooseberries are best. This is a very superior vinegar. 

Honey Vinegar. — One friend says she uses 1}4 pound of strained 
honey to a gallon of water, but Bulletin 146 of the Ontario (Canada) 
Department of Agriculture advises lYz ounce of honey to one gallon of 
clear, soft water. Store in a barrel with an opening to permit air circu- 
lation, in a warm place; at the end of a year it is ready for use. The 
Ontario bulletin says its keeping qualities are excellent, and the best of 
pickles can be made with it, while it is recommended for salads. 

Spiced Vinegar. — This gives a fine flavor to green vegetables, such as 
cucumbers, cabbage, cauliflower, beans, salads, etc. For each quart of 
vinegar slice a , clove of garlic, a small onion, a two-inch root of horse- 
radish, half an ounge of bruised ginger root, a teaspoonful each of 
unground black pepper, allspice and mustard seed. Put all in a stone jar 
and simmer on the range fo>-five hours. Then strain and bottle for use.

CATSUPS AND SAUCES. 

Barberry Catsup. — Stew three quarts of barberries with three cupfuls 
of water til) well cooked, then strain through a sieve. In a separate 
saucepan stew four quarts of cranberries, a cupful of raisins, a large 
quince sliced, four small onions minced and a quart of water for half an 
hour, then pass through a sieve; mix with the barberry juice and add 
half a cupful of vinegar, one-fourth of a cupful of salt, two cupfuls of 
brown sugar, a dessertspoonful each of ground cloves and ground all- 
spice, two tablespoonfuls each of black pepper and celery seed, one 
teaspoonful of cayenne, cinnamon and ginger and a grated nutmeg. Let 
the whole boil one minute. If too thick add vinegar or water. This recipe 
is given by Miss Parloa ; some cooks make the catsup omitting the quince 
and cranberries. 

Bordeaux Sauce. — Two quarts of cabbage chopped to a powder, one 
quart of chopped green tomatoes, drained free of juice, three small onions 
chopped, on* quart of vinegar, one-quarter ounce each of celery, seed, 
black pepper, ginger and turmeric, one-eighth pound of mustard seed, 
one-quarter cupful of salt, and one-half pound of brown sugar; mix 
togetheT, boil 13 minutes, and can while hot. 

Chili Sauce. — Peel and chop fine ■ one onion, and six large tomatoes, 
add one green sweet Spanish pepper and one small hot chili pepper, 
chopped; then season with one cupful of vinegar, one tablespoonful salt, 
two teaspoonfuls brown sugar, one teaspoonful each of ground ginger, 
cinnamon, cloves and black pepper, and half a nutmeg. Boil slowly until 
very thoroughly cooked, then bottle and seal when cold. 

Chutney Sauce. — Eight ounces of tart apples, peeled and cored, eight 
ounces of peeled tomatoes, eight ounces brown sugar, eight ounces salt, 
four ounces powdered ginger, four ounces red peppers, two ounces 
shallots (or onion), two ounces garlic. Pound all together in a mortar 
(or pass through a chopper set to cut fine) and then put all the materials 
together in a jar with 8J^ pints good vinegar. Place the jar in a warm 
place, covered for one month, stirring with a wooden spoon twice every 
day. At the end of the time pass the chutney through a sieve, and bottle, 
when it is ready for use. The intense heat of the peppers grows milder 
with keeping, and the chutney improves and becomes richer in flavor. 

Peach Chutney. — Pare and halve sufficient peaches to weigh, when 
ready, three pounds. Put them in a large agate saucepan, add one pint 
of vinegar and stew gently rntil tender. Pound together in a mortar 
four ounces of white onions, two ounces garlic and five ounces of fresh 
ginger root; add these to the peaches with six ounces each of sugar, 
seeded raisins and white mustard seed. Add two ounces of dried chillies 
and one cupful of vinegar. Simmer for 10 minutes longer, then bottle. 
This is a familiar old English recipe. i 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 179 

Cranberry Catsup (Good Housekeeping). — One quart of cranberries, 
one cup of water and two cups of vinegar. Tie in a piece of muslin a. 
few cloves, three or four allspice, about a dessertspoon of broken cinna- 
mon, and some mace. Simmer all together in a preserving kettle until 
the fruit is perfectly soft. Press through a colander, add one pound of 
brown sugar, simmer 10 minutes longer, and seal. This recipe will make 
a most delicious catsup, and one conveniently made in small quantities 
at any time throughout the Winter. 

Cucumber Catsup. — For a small quantity take 13 fine full-grown 
cucumbers and lay them an hour in cold water. Then pare them and 
grate them down in a deep dish. Grate also six small onions and mix 
them with the grated cucumber; season the mixture to your taste with 
pepper, salt and vinegar, making it of the consistency of jam. When 
thoroughly mixed put it in a glass jar, cover closely so that it will be 
perfectly air-tight. It will be found very nice to eat with beef or mutton, 
and if properly made and tightly covered it will keep well. It should be 
grated very fine, and the vinegar must be real cider vinegar. 

Ripe Cucumber Catsup. — (Some people call this a "'salad," but it is 
worth making under any name.) Peel 12 large, ripe cucumbers ; remove 
seeds and pulp; chop the solid meat; mix with it a cupful of salt and 
hang in bag to drain. Chop 13 large onions and six peppers and mix 
with the cucumbers. Mix together one-fourth pound white mustard seed; 
one-half cupful celery seed, and one cupful of sugar. Mix all together; 
cover with cold vinegar ; put in cans and fix tops firmly. The above, or 
any similar preparations should be kept in a dark, cool place. If the 
darkness is not available, wrap the cans with papers. 

Cooked Cucumber Catsup. — Choose large, nearly ripe cucumbers ; pare, 
reject seeds, chop very fine and measure. Allow one teaspoonful of salt 
for every pint of pulp, sprinkle with same and drain through a colander 
for six hours. For every quart of cucumber allow two cups of cider 
vinegar, four teaspoonfuls of grated horseradish, one tablespoonful each 
of white mustard seed and minced red pepper (seeds rejected) ; bring 
vinegar and flavoring to a boil, skim thoroughly and set aside until 
perfectly cold. Then add the pulp to the vinegar, stir well, put into pint 
jars, lay a nasturtium or horseradish leaf over the top and seal. Keep 
in a dark, cool place. 

Currant Catsup. — To five pounds of currants allow three pounds of 
sugar, one tablespoon of cinnamon, one tablespoonful of cloves, one 
tablespoonful of allspice, one teaspoonful of black pepper, one teaspoonful 
of- salt and half a pint of vinegar. Mash the currants and rub them 
through a sieve; then add the other ingredients and boil for twenty 
minutes. Bottle as you would tomato catsup. 



180 ' THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Gooseberry Catsup. — Five pounds of fruit, three pounds of sugar, V/i 
quart of vinegar, one tablespoonful of cloves, three tablespoonfuls of 
cinnamon, two tablespoonfuls of allspice. Wash the berries, put them in 
a porcelain stewpan, mash them well, add the other ingredients and boil 
until thick. Seal while hot. 

Grape Catsup. — Pick seven pounds of grapes off the stems, wash them, 
put them in a stone jar ajid set the jar over the fire in a deep pot of 
boiling water. Let the grapes cook in this manner for an hour in order 
to loosen the seeds. Remove from the fire and strain through a sieve, 
being careful that all the pulp goes through. Then add a pint of good 
cider vinegar, three and a half pounds of sugar and a teaspoonful each 
of cinnamon and cloves. Return to the fire and cook until thick. 

Mushroom Catsup. — The mushrooms should be freshly gathered; care- 
fully examined to see that they harbor no insects, and wiped, but not 
washed. Put a layer of mushrooms in the bottom of an earthen dish, 
and sprinl^e well with salt; then another layer and more salt, continuing 
until all are used. Cover with a folded towel, and stand in a cool place 
for 24 hours; then mash and strain through a coarse bag. If put in a 
warm place the juice will ferment. To every quart of liquid add one 
ounce of pepper corns, and boil slowly in a porcelain-lined kettle for 30 
minutes; then add one-fourth ounce whole allspice, one-half ounce sliced 
ginger root, one dozen who.le cloves and three blades of mace. Boil 15 
minutes longer, then take from the fire and stand aside to cool. When 
cool, strain through fiannel, and put in small bottles, filling to the very 
top. Cork tightly, and dip cork in sealing wax. This is a delicious 
relish or seasoning, especially with poultry and mutton. 

Oude Sauce. — Four quarts of green tomatoes, 18 small peppers, 18 
small white onions; chop all together, add three cupfuls of salt and let 
stand over night. In the morning drain off the water and add four 
cupfuls of sugar, four of horseradish, four tablespoonfuls of ground 
cloves, four of cinnamon and cover with vinegar; stew gently all day, 
then bottle and seal. 

Pepper Sauce. — Take two dozen large ripe peppers, remove the stems 
and most of the seeds ; put them in a kettle with three sliced onions, two 
cloves of garlic, one teaspoonful of salt, one pint of vinegar and one table- 
spoonful of grated horseradish ; boil together until the vegetables can be 
rubbed through a coarse sieve; return to the fire, add a pint of vinegar, 
one tablespoonful of brown sugar, one teaspoonful each of ground cloves, 
allspice and black pepper; boil five minutes; bottle and seal while hot. 

Plum Catsup. — Wash and drain four quarts of damson plums; cover 
with a quart of water and cook slowly until tender, then press through a 
sieve, rubbing through as much pulp and skin as you can; return to the 
kettle; add three-quarters of a pound of sugar, two Level tcafpoonfuj^.

of cinnamon, a half teaspoonful of allspice and one of ground cloves; 
simmer gently until as thick as tomato catsup; then bottle and cork. 

Peach Catsup. — Pare and quarter one peck of firm, ripe peaches; add 
one pint of water to the peelings and one dozen sliced kernels ; simmer 
30 minutes, then strain; add peaches to the liquor and simmer another 
30 minutes ; add one cupful of vinegar, one-half cupful each of lemon 
juice and sugar, two teaspoonfuls of ground cinnamon, and one-half 
teaspoonful each of ground cloves, mace and pepper, and boil very slowly 
until as thick as desired. Seal hot in pint jars. 

Red Pepper Catsup. — Two dozen pods of red pepper; put in a preserve 
kettle with a half pint of strong vinegar and a pint of water; set on the 
stove and let come to a boil. Add one root of grated horseradish, three 
sliced onions, six whole cloves and one-half ounce of white mustard seed. 
Let boil 10 minutes longer and strain. Put back in the kettle with a half 
teacupful of brown sugar, one ounce of celery seed and a pint of strong 
vinegar. Boil one hour, then bottle. This catsup will keep any length 
of time. 

Shirley Sauce. — Chop very fine twenty-four large tomatoes, two large 
onions, two peppers ; add one tablespoonful of salt, two of sugar, one 
teaspoonful each of ginger, cloves, allspice, cinnamon, one nutmeg, one 
pint of vinegar. Stew one hour and bottle while hot. 

Southern Mixed Catsup. — Peel and cut up enough crisp, green cucum- 
bers to fill a half-gallon measure, sprinkle with salt and let stand six 
hours, press the water from them and scald in weak vinegar. Prepare 
half a gallon of cabbage in the same way. Chop one dozen small onions, 
cover with boiling water and let stand half an hour. Cut in slices one 
quart of green tomatoes, one pint of green beans, one dozen small ears 
of tender corn and one dozen green peppers. Scald and drain them. 
Mix two tablespoonfuls of grated horseradish, one teacupful of ground 
mustard, two cupfuls of white mustard seed, three tablespoonfuls of 
turmeric, one of mace, three of celery seed, one of cinnamon, one of 
cayenne, two of olive oil and one pound of sugar. Put in a jar with- 
the prepared vegetables and cover with boiling vinegar. 

Tomato Catsup. — Pare one-half bushel tomatoes and cook until very 
soft, sift them, taking all the seeds out. Then cook until as thick as you 
desire the catsup and then add one quart vinegar, one-half pint salt, and 
the following spices: One tablespoonful each of cloves, ginger and cinna- 
mon, two tablespoonfuls each of mustard, black pepper and allspice, and 
one-half teaspoonful cayenne pepper. Let it cook 10 minutes, then bottle 
and cork tight, no further sealing is needed as it will keep for years 
simply corked. 

Tomato Catsup No. 2. — Wash and cut in pieces a half peck of ripe 
tomatoes. Cook in a porcelain-lined or granite iron preserving kettle till

soft enough to put through a sieve, which will remove skins and seeds, 
To the pulp add two tablespoonfuls of salt, two tablespoonfuls pepper, 
one-half tablespoon allspice, one-half tablespoon cloves and one-half pint 
vinegar. Let the tomato cook for several hours before adding the spices 
and vinegar. Mix the salt and spices dry in a bowl, and blend well before 
putting into the tomato. Cook till quite thick and put in bottles. Store 
in a cool cellar. 

Uncooked Tomato Catsup. — Peel and chop a peck of ripe tomatoes and 
hang in bag, to drain for 34 hours. Add to the drained tomato four 
bunches of celery . (chopped fine) and one large cupful of chopped onion. 
Mix the three vegetables thoroughly and then add one-fourth cup of salt; 
one-fourth cup sugar; two tablespoonfuls mustard seed; two tablespoon- 
fuls ground cinnamon; one teaspoonful ground allspice, and two large red 
peppers, chopped fine. Mix very thoroughly; cover with good cider 
vinegar, and put in self-sealing cans. 

Uncooked Catsup No. 3. — One peck of ripe tomatoes; two horseradish 
roots ; two large onions ; four stalks of celery ; two ounces mustard seed ; 
four green peppers; one scant cup of salt; one cup of sugar; three pints 
of vinegar. Pare and quarter tomatoes, place in colander to drain; chop 
fine the celery, onions and peppers; grate the horseradish. Mix all thor- 
oughly. Put in cans and seal. 

Green Tomato Catsup. — One peck of green tomatoes and two large 
onions sliced. Place them in layers, sprinkling salt between; let them

of mustard seed, one ounce allspice, one ounce cloves, one ounce ground 
mustard, one ounce ground ginger, two tablespoonfuls black pepper,, two 
teaspoonfuls celery seed, a quarter of a pound of brown sugar. Put all 
in preserving pan, cover with vinegar and boil two hours; then strain 
through a sieve and bottle for use. 

Tomato Chutney. — Two pounds .ripe tomatoes, two pounds sugar, one- 
half pound green ginger, one pound raisins stoned, one-fourth pound of 
salt, one ounce garlic, one-half ounce powdered chillies, one quart vinegar. 
Place the tomatoes in a shallow pan and put in an oven till they crack, 
when the skins can be readily removed. Peel and core and boil them 
with one-half of the vinegar 10 minutes. Pound or grind the ginger, 
garlic and raisins with enough vinegar to make them into a paste. Boil 
the sugar with the remainder of the vinegar into a thick syrup. Mix all 
the ingredients together with the salt and chillies, and boil till the fruit and 
syrup run the one way when put on a plate held sideways. Bottle and seal. 



CHAPTER XIII. 

SALADS. 

Beet Dressing. — One cupful vinegar, one-half cupful sugar, butter the 
size of a walnut, salt and pepper to taste, scant tablespoon of cornstarch 
or flour. Mix thoroughly, boil till it thickens, pour over the sliced boiled 
beets and serve immediately. 

Butter Dressing for Potato Salad. — One cupful butter, melted,' into 
which is stirred one tablespoonful of flour, half cupful of vinegar, one 
teaspoonful salt, one egg, half teaspoonful mustard, and a little pepper. 
Add a small cupful of boiling water, and cook together until thickened 
like cream. 

DressingL^With Bacon Fat. — Cook two tablespoonfuls of flour and a 
dash of paprika or red pepper in five tablespoonfuls of hot bacon fat. 
Add four or five tablespoonfuls of vinegar and half a cupful of water. 
Stir and cook until boiling. Then gradually pour over the beaten yolk 
of an egg (preferably two yOlks). Return to the fire (over hot water) to 
cook the egg, and add salt if needed. Use when" cold. This dressing is 
particularly good with endive or lettuce, alone or with eggs. 

French Dressing. — This consists of three tablespoonfuls of oil to one 
tablespoonful of vinegar. For every tablespoonful of vinegar and three 
of oil, take one-half teaspoonful of salt and one-fourth teaspoonful of 
black or white pepper. Mix the salt and pepper with the oil and add the 
vinegar*gradually, stirring thoroughly until it becomes white and a little 
thickened. This dressing must be used as soon as it is made or it will 
separate. 

Prepared Dressing. — Here is a delicious salad dressing, which will keep 
a long time if put on ice, or in a cold place. Mix half a cupful of oil, 
five tablespoonfuls vinegar, half a teaspoonful powdered sugar, half a 
small Bermuda onion, finely chopped, two tablespoonfuls chopped parsley, 
half a tablespoonful chopped red pepper, one tablespoonful chopped green 
pepper, on^ teaspoonful salt. Let it stand for an hour, then whip up 
with an egg beater before using. 

Sour Cream Dressing.— Chill a cupful of rich sour cream until very 
cold, then beat well for five minutes, adding, while beating, a tablespoon- 
ful of powdered sugar and a half teaspoonful of lemon juice. Slice 
chilled cucumbers very thin, and serve with this dressing. 

Salad Dressing Without Oil.— Piece of butter the size of an egg. 
Heat in granite basin, add sifted flour till thick. Then add one cupful 
of milk. When smooth add one cupful vinegar; two eggs (beaten); salt. 



184 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

pepper, red or black, mustard, seasoned as you wish; one tablespoon of 
sugar. Cook till thick. The <idition of a half cupful of well-beaten sour 
or sweet cream will be found excellent. This dressing on potatoes, cu- 
cumbers, lettuce or beets makes a most palatable salad. The friend who 
gave this says it is a dressing that will keep for some time. She always 
keeps a jar of it on hand. The left-over dish of beets, peas or string 
beans is put in the potato salad for supper. 

Mayonnaise. — Put the- uncocked yolks of two eggs into an earthen 
bowl, beat them well with a silver or wooden fork for about one minute; 
then add a half teaspoonful of salt, a dash of cayenne, and if you desire, 
a half-teaspoonful of mustard. Work these well together, and then add 
drop by drop, a half pint or more of olive oil. Stir rapidly and steadily 
v/hile adding the oil; do not reverse the motion, or the mayonnaise may 
curdle. After stirring in the first gill of oil, alternate occasionally with 
a few drops of lemon juice or vinegar. The more oil you use, the thicker 
the dressing. If too thick, add vinegar enough to make it the proper 
consistency. The mayonnaise should be kept as cool as possible during 
the making. 

Banana Salad. — The bananas are peeled, sliced lengthwise down the 
middle, dipped in mayonnaise, and laid, flat side up, on lettuce leaves. 
A layer of finely chopped peanuts is put on the banana, and a spoonful of 
mayonnaise dressing put by it. Serve with heated graham crackers. This 
is delicious. 

Beet Salad. — Slice and cut into dice enough cold boiled beets to make 
a pint; heap in the center of a salad dish, and cover with sauce Tartare. 
This is made by adding a few chopped olives, gherkins and capers to 
mayonnaise dressing. If the mayonnaise is not desired, any ordinary salad 
mixture may be used, and the salad garnished with hard-boiled eggs and 
parsley. 

Cream S'aw. — Cut a small half head of white, tender cabbage on a 
slaw cutter (or fine, with a sharp knife) ; sprinkle a very little black 
pepper over it, and add one-third of small teaspoonful of salt. Have 
ready a small half pint of thick sweet cream; add to this three even 
tablespoonfuls of granulated sugar; stir until dissolved, then whip this 
to a stiff froth, adding gradually two and a half tablespoonfuls -of good 
vinegar. When finished pour over the cabbage, stirring it lightly until 
all is covered and stand in refrigerator, or in cold water, for 10 or 15 
minutes before serving. The slaw should not be made too long before 
serving, as the cold, crisp taste is most appetizing. 

Herring Salad,- — Heat through by broiling, or in the oven, three smoked 
herrings. Then tear off the heads and pull the skin away; split, take out 
the backbones, and cut up into small bits, or to shred them is better. 
Put in a salad bowl, add one small chopped onion, two hard-boiled eggs, 
chopped, and one boiled potato; cut fine with a teaspoonful of chopped 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 185 

parsley; season with a teaspoonful of salt, one of pepper, three table- 
spooTifuIs of vinegar and two of oil; mix well, and if you have it, deco- 
riate with a boiled beet. 

Hot Slaw. — Cut a head of cabbage fine. Have ready enough, dressing, 
half vinegar and half water, and one-fourth sugar, with a lump of butter 
to cover it. Simmer until done. It is good cold. It is well to salt the 
dressing a little, to taste. 

Potato Salad. — Slice cold boiled potatoes with one raw onion to sea- 
son. For the salad dressing, put on stove a saucepan with one pint of 
vinegar and butter the size of an egg. Beat two or three eggs with two 
tablespoonfuls of mustard and a small teaspoonfid of Salt, and one of 
black pepper, two tablespoonfuls of sugar. When thoroughly beaten pour 
slowly into the vinegar until it thickens. Be careful not to cook too 
long, or the egg will curdle. Remove and when cold pour over the salad. 
It improves this to add the yolks of two or three hard boiled eggs mashed 
fine and beaten in with the mustard, or add a cupful of cream. This will 
keep several days in a cool place if desired". Plain French dressing may 
be used instead if desired. 

German Potato Salad. — Boil a few extra potatoes at dinner time. 
When cojd, carefully slice very thin. Set away to chill. When supper 
time comes, cut for a quart of sliced potatoes one good-sized onion into 
thin slices. Add a dash of pepper. Take two big slices of bacon, very 
fat, cut into cubes, fry, add one-half cupful of vinegar. Pour over the 
calad and toss lightly with two forks. 

Waldorf Salad. — Handsome red apples are selected, polished, but not 
peeled, cored, and then hollowed into cups. The pieces removed are 
mixed with chopped celery, put in the apple cups, a spoonful of mayon- 
naise dres^sing being put over the top. The apples are put on individual 
plates, each fruit standing on a crinkly lettuce leaf. 



CHAPTER XIV. 

CHEBSB. 

Cottage Cheese. — Bulletin No. 245, issued by the New York Experi- 
ment Station at Geneva, is devoted to this subject; it will be found help- 
ful by anyone making this cheese, either for market or domestic use. In 
describing the manufacture of this cheese, the bulletin says that good 
cottage cheese should have a soft, smooth texture, being neither mushy 
nor dry and sawdust like. The flavor should be that of mildly soured 
milk or well ripened cream, with an entire absence of bitter taste, flavor 
of stable, or other objectionable qualities. Such flavor may usually be 
secured by the use of a good starter; but if too much whey is retained 
the cheese may be sour. Flavor and texture are quite closely connected, 
at this point, for a slow draining curd is liable to result in poor textured 
and poor flavored cheese. The various steps in making cottage cheese 
may be summarized as follows. 

Use skim-milk rather than whole milk, to avoid loss of fat. To se- 
cure proper flavor and speedy souring add a small amount of a good 
starter. This starter should be prepared from clean, fresh milk, sep- 
arated from the cream and placed in a carefully cleaned receptacle, well 
covered and brought to a temperature of 90 degrees, and then allowed to 
stand from 20 to 34 hours at a temperature of 65 to 78 degrees. The 
upper portion of this should be discarded and the amount needed strained 
through a fine strainer or hair sieve and thoroughly mixed with the milk 
from which cheese is to be made the next day. A portion may also be 
used in preparing a starter for the next day, but as soon as any unfav- 
orable effect is noticed a new starter should be prepared. Several good 
and convenient commercial starters are on the market, for use of which 
directions accompany each package. 

The milk is now kept at a temperature of 70 to 75 degrees until well 
curdled, often in 24 hours, sometimes not until 48 hours. The curdled 
mass is broken up by hand or by a curd knife, raised gradually to 90 de- 
grees, taking 30 to 40 minutes in the process. The whey should then 
separate clear in 15 to 20 minutes, after which it is run from the ciird, 
and the latter placed in muslin bags or on racks to drain. When whey 
ceases to come from the curd, salt is added to taste or at the rate of 
about a pound for 100 pounds of cheese, the curd formed into balls and 
wrapped in oiled paper that may be obtained from any dairy supply 
house. For the finest quality of cheese, thick cream, preferably ripened 
cream, should be added at the rate of about an ounce for one pound 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 187 

of cheese, before the cheese is made into balls. If it is thought best to 
hasten the curdling rennet extract may be added about eight hours after 
the starter has been introduced, using one ounce of rennet extract for 
1,000 pounds of milk. 

Escalloped Cheese. — Into a buttered baking dish sprinkle a layer of 
coarse bread crumbs, with butter, pepper and salt on top. Next add a 
layer of cheese, alternating with bread and cheese until the dish is full. 
Have bread crumbs on top, pour on sweet milk until you can see it by 
tilting the dish a little, and bake until done. 

Cheese Fondu. — Put one tablespoonful of butter in pan, then one cup 
milk; let it boil, then add one cup bread crumbs and two cups grated 
cheese, little pepper and dry mustard. When the cheese melts add two 
well-beaten eggs. 

Macaroni with Cheese. — Throw one-half box of macaroni into boiling 
water and cook 20 minutes. Never let the water stop boiling, or the 
macaroni will be soft. Drain and pour into a buttered baking dish. Have 
ready one cup of cheese cut into small pieces and stir this through the 
hot macaroni together with salt and pepper to taste and a lump of butter 
the size of a small egg. Add enough sweet milk almost to cover and 
sprinkle the top with more grated cheese. Bake three-quarters of an 
hour in a moderate oven. A good supper dish on a cold night. 

Cheese Patties. — When making pies line a number of patty pans with 
thin paste and bake. These will keep several days, but are better fresh. 
Grate one-fourth pound cheese and add one pint milk, one tablespoon 
flour, one-half teaspoon mustard or one dessertspoon prepared mustard, 
one tablespoon butter and salt and pepper to taste. Carefully heat to- 
gether, stirring to make a smooth mass. Serve hot in the patty shells. 

Cheese Puffs. — Make some puff paste ; roll it out and cut it into squares 
of about three inches. Beat the yolks of two eggs and a little made mus- 
tard, a dash of cayenne pepper and two tablespoonfuls of grated cheese, 
to form a thick paste. Place a spoonful of the mixture in each square 
of pastry, pull the four points to the center, pinching them together to 
make them stand up. Bake 10 minutes and serve very hot. 

Cheese Pudding. — Lay thin slices of stale bread, lightly buttered, in a 
baking dish, and cover with broken cheese, no matter how old and dry 
it is. Season with red pepper and salt. Fill the dish with alternate 
layers of bread and cheese. Beat two eggs in a pint of milk, pour over 
the bread and cheese, and bake in a hot oven. This will serve six per- 
sons. 

Spanish Rabbit. — To a cupful of grated cheese add two-thirds the 
quantity of minced onion, which is first cooked in boiling water. Drain 
and add milk almost to cover the onions ; season with salt and pepper 
and when the milk is hot put in the cheese. As soon as the cheese is 
melted stir in one well-beaten egg. Cook a moment longer and serve. 



188 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Cheese Ramekins. — Two ounces of bread crumbs boiled in one gill 
of milk; to this add four tablespoonfuls of grated cheese, two of melted 
butter, and stir over the fire until blended. Take off and add the beaten 
yolks of two eggs, salt and pepper to taste. Beat the whites of three 
eggs stiff, stir carefully into the mixture, and bake 15 minutes in a quick 
oven. 

Cheese Souffle.— Put two tablespoonfuls of butter in a saucepan; when 
it melts add one heaping tablespoonful of flour, stir until smooth; add a 
half-cup of milk, a saltspoonful of salt and a saltspoonful of paprika; 
cook two miiiutes; add the well-beaten yolks of three eggs and one cup 
of grated cheese, but take it off the fire just before adding them, and 
when you stir them all in well set it away to cool. When cold add the 
stifily beaten whites of the eggs, turn into a buttered dish and place im- 
mediately in the oven and bake 25 or 30 minutes. Have a folded napkin 
ready to. wrap around the dish and serve it immediately, or it will fall. 

Cheese Sticks. — Mix together one pint grated cheese, one pint flour, 
one tablespoon butter, two scant teaspoons baking powder, a little salt 
and a dash of pepper. Mix with milk or water and roll thin like pie 
crust. Cut into strips four or five inches long and nearly an inch wide. 
Bake in a quick oven. 

Cheese Straws. — ^One cupful of grated cheese and one tablespoonful of 
butter creamed together; two slices of bread, without crust, dried in oven 
and rolled fine. Four tablespoonfuls of cold water, pinch of salt, dust 
of red pepper, and flour enough to roll out. Cut in strips and bake a 
delicate brown. 

Cheese Toast. — Grate a cupful of cheese, and lightly mix in a heaping 
saltspoonful of mustard, a half-saltspoonful of salt and a speck of cay- 
enne. Heap this on thin strips or triangles of buttered toast, place them 
in a hot oven for a few moments, and serve as soon as the cheese begins 
to melt. Any kind of a thin cracker may be used instead, and a dusting 
of paprika over each piece in place of the cayenne. 

Welsh Custards. — One cupful of dry grated cheese, four eggs, one cup- 
ful of milk, one teaspoonful of butter, two of flour, mixed with milk, a 
bit of soda size of pea, half a teaspoonful of salt and a pinch of cayenne. 
Heat the milk, stirring in the soda, butter, salt and pepper, and the flour 
mixture, and pour scalding hot on the eggs beaten light in a bowl. Add 
the cheese, beat up for a minute, pour into buttered custard cups and 
bake in a brisk oven for 20 minutes. They should be served instantly. 



CHAPTER XV. 

WARM SUPPER AND BREAKFAST DISHES. 

Anchovy Toast. — Toast a small round of bread for each person, butter 
and put fn vegetable dish. Make a sauce of one pint of milk and two 
tablespoonfuls of flour ; when thickened add level saltspoonful of salt, 
dash of cayenne and three teaspoonfuls of anchovy essence or five 
anchovies boned and pounded. Pour over the toast; serve hot. 

Arrowroot Cream Toast— First put into a double boiler a scant pint 
of rich milk and a teacupful of cream ; let it come to the boiling point, 
then add a large tablespoonful of fresh butter and a tablespoonful of 
arrowroot wetted in a little milk or cream ; season to taste with salt, and 
let it boil up. Toast light slices of bread, browning evenly. Put two 
slices at a time into the sauce, and as soon as they soften all through, 
which will only take a short time, put in a covered dish kept hot. Pour 
a little sauce over each layer, and serve the toast while very hot. 

Golden Cream Toast. — Cut slices of stale bread into diamonds and 
toast to a pale brown, drying slightly in the oven before browning. Make 
a rich white sauce of a pint of milk, three tablespoonfuls of butter, two 
tablespoonfuls of flour, half a teaspoonful of salt, a dusting of mace and 
a light dusting of pepper. Cook until smooth, add the grated yolks 
of three hard-boiled eggs and pour over the toasted bread. 

Baked Toast. — Prepare toast in the ordinary way, and, as each slice 
is ready, dip quickly into a pan of boiling water slightly salted, then 
pack into a baking dish, sprinkle well with salt, and cover deep with 
boiling milk. Bake in a dish, closely covered, for 15 minutes, and serve. 
The toast should have absorbed all the liquid without getting dry. If 
you can spare three or four tablespoonfuls of cream, heat, and pour over 
the surface just before sending to the table. The baking lends smooth- 
ness and richness to this dish not to be found in milk toast prepared in 
the usual way. 

Bread Croquettes.- — Rub the inside of a loaf of stale bread through 
a colander, then measure. To one good quart add one pint of milk and 
heat over the fire in a double boiler. As soon as it reaches the scalding 
point take it off, let stand for a moment, then add one-half of a cupful 
of cleaned currants, two tablespoonfuls of chopped citron, one-half of a 
teaspoonful of cinnamon, two tablespoonfuls of chopped almonds and 
the beaten yolks of two raw eggs. Return to the fire and stir and cook 
for two minutes, then turn out on a greased dish and set aside until cold. 
P'orm carefully into small cylinders, dip each in egg, roll in fine dried 
crumbs and fry golden brown in hot fat. Serve with a foamy sauce. 



190 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Cheese Pie. — Cut bread into one-third inch slices, cutting each slice in 
half. Butter a shallow baking dish, put in a layer of bread, then a layer 
of soft mild cheese, cut in one-eighth inch slices, and sprinkled with salt 
and paprika or pepper. Beat two eggs slightly and add one cup of milk. 
Pour over the bread and bake until the cheese is soft, which will take 
about 30 minutes. 

Hulled Corn au Gratin. — For one quart of hulled corn prepare a pint 
of rich cream sauce, flavoring it with Worcestershire sauce or other 
condiments to make it piquant. Put the sauce and corn in a baking dish 
or individual ramekins in alternate layers, sprinkle the top with grated 
cheese and a dusting of paprika, and bake until well browned on top. 

Noodles. — Beat an egg slightly, but not until it foams; salt it to 
season the dough, and then work in all the flour the egg can be made 
to take up. Take the dough on to the board and knead in flour until it 
is stiff and smooth, then roll out as thin as possible. Let the sheet of 
dough dry for a while, but roll it into a roll like a jelly roll befbre it 
gets dry enough to break when rolled; slice from the end, and shake into 
strings. The thinner the dough is rolled, and the finer it is cut the better 
the noodles are. A very thin, sharp knife makes the work of cutting 
much easier and insures much finer noodles. The directions given call 
for one egg as a basis, but the method of making is exactly the same if 
six, or a dozen eggs are used. Three medium-sized eggs will make a 
sheet of dough 20 inches square if properly rolled out, and will be 
enough for a family of six or eight hungry people. When dry enough 
to roll and cut, the noodles are dry enough to cook, but they may be kept 
for hours or days, after they are cut. 

Cheese Noodles. — Make your noodles the day before you want to use 
them and shave fine. Drop lightly into boiling water and allow them to 
cook 15 minutes over a hot fire. Do not let them simmer, or they will 
turn out a mushy mass. Drain and fill a rather deep pan to the depth 
of two inches. Season with salt and pepper and pour over them enough 
sweet milk almost to cover. Over the top grate cheese to the depth of 
half an inch, cover and bake one hour, removing cover the last 15 min- 
utes unless oven is too hot. 

Rice Croquettes. — To one teacupful of boiled rice, add one teaspoonful 
of butter, a beaten egg, a seasoning of salt and pepper, and mix well to- 
gether. Mold into rolls, or small cakes, dip into egg, and then into pow- 
dered cracker crumbs and fry in hot butter or drippings. A little finely 
chopped cold meat is an improvement; it should be mixed with the rice 
and egg before molding. 

Rice Muffins. — One pint of milk, one pint boiled rice, two eggs, two table- 
spoonfuls of sugar, one tablespoonful of butter, one teaspoonful each of 
salt and baking powder. Beat the sugar, salt, yolks of eggs and butter 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 191 

together, add the milk and sufficient flour to make a thin batter; sift the 
rice in lightly, and last the beaten whites. Bake in rings 30 minutes. 

Royal Toast. — Put bread toasted a delicate brown in a square shallow 
pan; put a piece of butter the size gf a walnut on each slice, and sprinkle 
with sugar. Arrange in layers, and pour over the whole enough milk 
or cream to half fill the pan. Cover closely and set in a slow oven until 
the liquid is all absorbed. 

Swiss Toast. — Mash one-half box of berries, but not too fine; sweeten 
one-quarter cup of sugar, then cut five slices of stale bread as for toast- 
ing. Cover each slice with the berries. Retain some of the juice so as 
not to make the bread too soft. Heat about two tablespoonfuls of but- 
ter in a large frying pan ; put the slices with the berries on them carefully 
into the hot butter and fry slowly until the bread is browned on the un- 
derside, basting the berries with the butter while in the pan. Transfer the 
bread and berries to a hot platter; pour the rest of the juice over them 
and serve immediately. 

Tomato Toast. — This can often be made from stewed or scalloped to- 
matoes left over from dinner ; the extra juice from canned tomatoes 
which often makes them seem too watery, is useful for the toast. The 
tomato is simmered with the proper flavoring, strained through a sieve, 
and then thickened with flour and butter before being poured over the 
toast. If one wishes to make more of a dish, crisp fried bacon may be 
served with it, or a spoonful of minced ham or other cooked meat may 
be put on the top of each piece of toast before the tomato is pouted 
over it. 

Creamed Tomatoes. — Peel several tomatoes and cut them in moderately 
thick slices. Fry them in butter, seasoning them as they are frying with 
pepper and salt. Remove them carefully to a platter, leaving the shreds 
of the tomatoes that have fallen off. Pour into the pan about three- 
quarters of a cup of rich milk and thicken with flour. Pour this sauce 
over the tomatoes. 

Blueberry Pancakes. — Sift one scant pint of flour with one teaspoonful 
of baking powder and a half-teaspoonful of salt. Mix two well-beaten 
eggs with zyi cupfuls of sweet milk and thoroughly blend all together. 
Grease the griddle, drop the batter on in large spoonfuls and spread a 
teaspoonful of blueberries on each, pressing into the cake. Turn, and 
when brown serve with butter and powdCTed sugar. 

Buckwheat Cakes. — One pint milk scalded and cooled, one-TiaJf " tea- 
spoonful salt. When lukewarm add one-fourth of a yeast cake which has 
been dissolved in a little warm water,; one cup buckwheat flour and one 
cup white flour. Let rise over night. In the morning stir in 'one-fourth 
teaspoonful of soda and one tablespoonful molasses. Beat vigorously 
before cooking. 

Mixed Buckwheat Cakes. — Sift together two cupfuls of buckwheat, 



192 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

one cupful of rolled oats, one cupful of cornmeal, one scant teaspoonful 
of salt. Mix to a pour batter, with equal parts of milk and water, add 
one-third of a cake of compressed yeast, cover and stand in a warm 
place over night; before baking add one-third of a teaspoonful of soda 
dissolved in hot water. These are good and easy of digestion. 

Crumb Croquettes. — Melt a tablespoonful of butter in a frying pan 
and add a tablespoonful of flour; a cupful o.f sweet milk, and salt and 
pepper to season. Cook until it thickens, then add one beaten egg. Re- 
move from the fire and mix in bread crumbs until the mixture is thick. 
Make into balls and let get cold. Roll in egg and crumbs; fry in deep 
fat like other croquettes. 

Crumb Pancakes. — Two cupfuls sour milk, one-half teaspoonful soda, 
two cupfuls stale bread crumbs, two eggs, two cupfuls flour, two level 
tca.spoonfuls baking powder, pinch of salt. Soak bread crumbs in the 
milk over night, add dissolved soda; if one has stale Johnny cake a 
change may be made by using one cupful bread crumbs and one cupful 
Johnny cake crumbs. In the morning add the eggs, well beaten, then sift 
in the flour and baking powder. It may be that two cupfuls of flour 
will not be needed to make a suitable batter; use just enough. 

French Pancakes. — Beat five eggs very light, add two tablespoonfuls 
of melted butter, one and one-half pints of milk, and enough wheat 
flour, sifted with two teaspoonfuls of baking powder, to make a good 
batter. About a quart of flour will be .needed. M'elt a little butter in a 
large frying pan, and pour the batter into this. When brown on one 
side, turn carefully and brown on the other. When done, spread quickly 
with fruit jelly, and roll up as you would a shaet of music. Transfer 
carefully to a very hot dish, sprinkle with powdered sugar, or with pow- ; 
dored sugar and ground cinnamon, and serve immediately. 

Flannel Cakes. — One cupful of Indian meal, two cupfuls of flour, three 
of boiling milk, one-fourth of a yeast cake, one teaspoonful of salt, two 
tablespoonfuls of butter and one of sugar. Pour the boiling milk upon 
the meal and butter ; let it cool ; then add the flour, salt, sugar and the 
portion of yeast dissolved in four tablespoonfuls of cold water. Let it 
rise over night, and in the morning fry as you would griddle cakes. 

Yeast Flannel Cakes. — Heat a half-pint of sweet milk and into it put 
one heaping tablespoonful btitter, let it melt, add a half pint cold milk 
and the well beaten yolks of two eggs, a half teaspoonful of salt, two 
tablespoonfuls homemade yeast, and flour to make a stiiif batter. Let 
rise in a warm place over night. Before baking add the beaten whites, 
which have been kept in a cool place during the night. Be sure to make 
batter stiff enough, as flour must not be added after it has risen. These 
cakes, half cornmeal and half wheat, are very nice.

PREFACE 



For many years The R. N.-Y. has been collecting tested recipes from 
an immense army of practical housewives. Some are entirely original; 
others are doubtless modifications of familiar practice. It is an easy 
matter to mislay a recipe not needed for immediate use, and we are thus 
often asked to repeat their publication, not once, but perhaps a dozen 
limes. For this reason it seemed wise to print a selection of these recipes 
in permanent form, and "The Rural Cook Book" was decided upon, as 
a successor to "The Business Hen" and "The Farmer's Garden." Before 
we had finished assem.bling our material, however, we discovered that we 
had enough recipes alone to fill four books of the required size, and the 
question became not what to put in, but what to leave out. It was decided 
that we must give as much space as possible to canning, preserving, 
pickling, and other uses of fruit and vegetables, as such recipes are 
especially useful to farm housekeepers. This little book is not intended, 
however, to be a complete guide to domestic economy; in spite of its 
omissions we feel sure that it will be found a real practical helper, and 
we also think it will fill a place left vacant by many a more pretentious 
volume.

CHAPTER I. 

SOUPS. 

Here are some certain rules of health; 
Take them — they're better far than wealth : 
Don't overeat, don't overdrink, 
Don't overwork, don't overthink, 
Be not afraid of honest sweat ; 
.Run like a deer from shame and debt. 
Beware of bigness of the head. 
Get bigness of the soul instead. 

Almond and Celery Soup. — Cut in small pieces a bunch of celery, 
using the leaves and carefully scraped root; add six peppercorns, two 
bay leaves, a tablespoonful of onion juice, a thin slice of lemon, a tea- 
spoonful of salt, and a stick of cinnamon; cover with a quart of water 
and cook an hour, strain and reheat, stirring in a cup of rich milk (cream 
is better), a teaspoonful each of flour and butter blended together, and 
one-quarter of a cup of blanched almonds that have been pounded to a 
paste, allowing soup to boil for a moment or two after the nuts are 
added. Serve very hot with cheese crackers. 

English Beef Soup. — Take the cracked joints of beef, and after put- 
ting the meat in the pot and covering it well with water let it come 
to a boil, when it should be well skimmed. Set the pot where the meat 
will simmer slowly until it is thoroughly done, keeping it closely cov- 
ered all the time. The next day, or when cold, remove the fat which 
hardens on the top of the soup. Peel, wash and slice three good-sized 
potatoes and put them into the soup ; cut up half a head of white cab- 
bage in shreds and add to this a pint of Shaker corn that has been 
soaked over night, two onions, one head of celery, and tomatoes, if de- 
sired. When these are done, and they should simmer slowly, care being 
taken that they do not burn, strain (or not, as preferred) the soup and 
serve. The different varieties of beef soup are formed by this method 
of seasoning and the different vegetables used in preparing it after the 
joints have been well boiled. Besides onions, celery, cabbage, tomatoes 
and potatoes, many use a few carrots, turnips, beets and force-meat balls, 
seasoned with spice. Rice or barley will give the soup consistency, and 
are to be preferred to flour for the purpose. Parsley, thyme and sage 
are the favorite herbs for seasoning, but should be used sparingly. To 
make force-meat balls add to one pound chopped beef one egg, a small 
lump of butter, a cup or less of bread crumbs; season with salt and 
pepper and moisten with water from stewed meat; make in balls and 



8 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

fry brown, or make egg-balls by boiling eggs, mashing the yolks with a 
silver spoon and mixing with one raw yolk and one teaspoonful of flour ; 
season with salt and pepper, make into balls; drop in soup just before 
serving. 

Black Bean or Lentil Soup. — Soak a pint of black beans or lentils over 
night. In the morning, parboil them. Boil gently in fresh water until 
soft enough to rub through a sieve. Add a bay leaf, some cloves, and 
a stalk of celery. Brown two slices of bacon cut in dice with half a 
minced onion and turn into the soup. Serve with squares of toast. 

■ Brown Flour Soup. — Put a lump of butter into a clean iron frying 
pan. When melted, sprinkle in half a cupful of flour and stir briskly 
until the flour is of a uniform brown color like roasted coffee. Add this 
gradually to two quarts of water. Peel and cut into cubes three pota- 
toes and cook in the soup 20 minutes. Season with an onion and a tea- 
spoonful of celery salt. 

Consomm.e. — Cut up two pounds of lean raw meat, beef or veal, and 
add a cupful of cold roast beef, cut in pieces. Put over the fire with a 
cracked knuckle of veal, four quarts of cold water, two onions, one 
carrot, two stalks of celery, six peppercorns, a spoonful of salt, six 
cloves and a few herbs. Cook slowly all day. Strain, and when cold 
skim off the fat. Add the white and shells of two eggs. Bring to a 
boil and boil 10 minutes. Strain through a cloth. 

Corn Chowder. — Pare and slice thin onions enough to make a pint; 
boil one hour; to this add one-half pint potatoes cut small, boil 10 
minutes longer. Fry brown a slice of fat salt pork cut small and add 
fat and all, then a pint of tender sweet corn (canned corn is all right). 
Boil 10 minutes longer; the whole of this now should be two quarts or 
more; this is the best time to salt and pepper to taste. Add one pint 
of milk and a cupful of cream or a piece of butter as large as an egg if 
cream is not plentiful. Do not let cream boil; serve very hot. 

Cream of Corn Soup. — Scrape the corn from eight tender young 
ears. Boil the cobs in as little water as may be for 30 minutes. Strain 
off the liquid, add the scraped corn and boil 20 minutes. Heat one quart 
of sweet milk to scalding point; rub together one tablespoonful butter 
and one teaspoonful flour; stir into the hot milk. Add one-half tea- 
spoonful salt, one-quarter teaspoonful white pepper. Pour over the corn, 
stir for a minute or two, then pour into hot tureen. Serve with crou- 
tons. Croutons — Cut bread two days old into small triangles or dice. 
Brown in oven to a golden tint. They are very nice spread with a paste 
made of twice the quantity of butter cream.ed, of delicate cheese grated 
and a little finely chopped parsley. (Two teaspoons butter, one of grated 
cheese, one-fourth teaspoon chopped parsley). The croutons can be 
fried if desired. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 9 

Cream of Eggs. — Slice a medium-sized onion into a quart of milk 
and bring the milk to the scalding point in a double boiler. Strain 
out the onion and return the milk to the kettle with a teaspoonful of 
flour that has been rubbed ♦^o a paste with the same quantity of butter. 
Stir to a smooth cream-like soup, and just before serving season with 
one teaspoonful of salt and three shakes of pepper. Chop coarsely, the 
white of four or five hard-boiled eggs and add to the soup. When 
ready to serve sprinkle each portion with the grated yolks. 

Cream of Salsify. — Take two bunches of salsify, wash, scrape and cut 
in small pieces and boil until tender. While hot mash and press through 
a colander. Have ready a cream made of two tablespoons of flour and 
two of butter melted together, seasoned with one-half saltspoonful white 
pepper and stirred into three cups milk and one cup water, which have 
previously been brought to a boil. Stir constantly until the consistency 
of a puree; add the prepared salsify, let boil up once, add three-quarters 
of a teaspoonful salt, and serve immediately. 

Fish Chowder. — Two pounds of fresh cod or any white fish, a quar- 
ter-pound bacon, four large potatoes, one small onion, half a can tomatoes, 
one quart milk, butter the size of a walnut, and a teaspoonful of flour 
for thickening. Pick the fish to pieces, removing all bone and skin; 
peel potatoes and cut into dice ; cut the bacon in small pieces ; rub the 
butter and flour to a cream. On the bottom of a granite kettle spread 
half of the potatoes in a layer, then half of fish, then sprinkle in the 
onions minced fine, then the bacon, then half the tomatoes. Then a 
shake of salt and pepper; add the rest of the fish, potatoes, tomatoes and 
more salt and pepper, using in all one teaspoonful salt and one-half tea- 
spoonful pepper. Cover with water, let simmer for half an hour. Let 
the milk come to a scald, put a pinch of soda into the chowder and stir; 
add the hot milk to the butter and flour; stir smooth; then add to the 
chowder ; let get very hot, and serve. 

Milk Soup. — The various soups known as creams are usually about 
half milk and half meat or vegetable stock, slightly thickened with flour 
which has been blended with fat. For example, the tough, flabby portions 
and white leaves of a bunch of celery might be cut in small pieces, mixed 
with a sliced onion, covered with cold water and cooked until much of it 
can be. rubbed through a strainer. To this juice and pulp is added an 
equal portion or even more of hot milk. For thickening a quart of soup 
slightly, one ounce of butter and one rounding tablespoonful of flour 
should be cooked together in a small saucepan until frothing, then add a 
little of the soup and beat until smooth, and then mix with the whole 
Season with salt and pepper. For a thicker soup use twice as much 
flour and butter, though the butter may be decreased slightly. However, 
if we use skim-milk for the soup, as we may, the increase of butter is 



10 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

desirable. Such soups can be made from almost any vegetable, varying 
the thickening according to the thickness of the pulp of the vegetables. 
Bean and pea soup require less flour, but a little will keep them from 
becoming watery on top. A corn chowder can be made much like a 
fish chowder from fresh or canned corn with pork fat, onion and po- 
tato. Such soups are excellent for supper on a cold night, and give an 
opportunity to turn skim-milk to good account. 

Mock Oyster Soup. — Scrape a dozen roots of salsify, throwing at once 
into cold water to avoid discoloring, cut into thin slices and cover with 
a quart of water, or preferably soup stock. Cook gently until perfectly 
tender (about an hour) ; then add a quart of milk, a teaspoonful of salt, 
one-fourth teaspoonful of pepper, and two tablespoonfuls of butter cut 
into bits. Serve with oyster crackers. 

Italian Onion Soup. — Boil six young but fully grown onions in two 
waters, turning off the first at the end of 10 minutes' boil, and replac- 
ing with fresh hot water. There should be a quart of the second water. 
When the onions are tender, add a cupful of dry, fine bread crumbs and 
cook gently for five minutes more. Pour the contents of the kettle into 
a colander and rub the onions and crumbs through it into the liquid in 
the bowl below. Return all to the fire, simmer for a minute and stir into 
the soup a "roux," made by heating to a bubbling cream a great spoon- 
ful of butter with one of flour in a frying pan. Have ready heated in 
another saucepan a cup of milk in which you have dropped a pinch of 
soda. Take the boiling soup from the fire, stir in the hot milk, and pour 
into a heated tureen. Pass Parmesan cheese with it. 

Cream, of Oyster Soup. — Add to one quart of milk half of a small 
onion, two sprigs of parsley and a half a cupful of celery leaves and 
stalks. Scald in a double boiler. Mix one-fourth of a cupful of flour 
with sufficient cold milk to make a paste and add it to the scalded milk. 
Stir until it thickens and let cook for about 20 minutes covered. Pour 
a cupful of cold water over a quart of oysters, strain the liquid through 
a cheesecloth and heat to a boiling point. Add the oj^sters and when the 
boiling point is reached add the thickened milk. Season with salt and 
white pepper and stir in, little by little, one-fourth of a cup of butter. 

Pink Velvet Soup. — Half a canful of tomatoes, one pint of water, 
one tablespoonful of butter, one large onion, chopped small ; one potato 
shaved thin, a saltspoonful of celery seed, a teaspoonful of salt, a table- 
spoonful of sugar and a pinch of sweet marjoram. Boil all together 
for half an hour, or until the potatoes melt. Strain, thicken with gran- 
ulated tapioca or cornstarch, boil five minutes, add a pinch of baking soda, 
and then pour in a pint of hot milk. Serve at once. 

Potato Soup.— Three potatoes, one pint milk, one teaspoonful chopped 
onions, one stalk celery, one teaspoonful salt, one teaspoonful celery salt,

one-half saltspoonful white pepper, one-fourth saltspoonful cayenne, one- 
half tablespoonful flour, one tablespoonful butter. Pare the potatoes 
and soak them in cold water one-half hour. Boil them until very soft. 
Cook onions and celery in milk in double boiler. When potatoes are 
soft drain and mash, add boiling milk and seasoning. Rub through 
strainer and put on to boil again. Melt butter in small saucepan ; when 
bubbling add flour; when well mixed stir into boiling soup. Boil five 
minutes and serve very hot. This flour thickening prevents milk and 
potato from separating, and gives a smoothness quite unlike granular 
efl"ects often noticed. If too thick add hot milk. The soup may also be 
made with meat stock instead of milk. 

Salmon Bisque. — One pint of oyster liquor and one of hot water 
heated together. When it boils stir in two cupfuls of finely minced 
salmon, seasoning with pepper, salt and a little chopped parsley. In an- 
other saucepan put one cupful of milk and heat to scalding, with a pinch 
of soda; stir into this two tablespoonfuls of butter, rubbed with one 
tablespoonful of flour and a half cupful of pounded cracker. Add one 
Q^g^ well beaten and stir and cook for a moment. Mix the fish and 
milk mixtures, cook a few moments, pour into soup tureen and serve 
hot. 

Scotch Broth. — One-half cup pearl barley, two pounds neck of mutton, 
tv/o quarts cold water, one-fourth cup each of turnip, carrot, onion and 
celery chopped small, two tablespoons butter, one tablespoon flour, two 
teaspoonfuls salt, one saltspoon parsley chopped fine. Soak barley over 
night. Remove fat and skin from mutton, scrape meat from bones and 
cut in dice. Put bones on to boil in one pint cold water, the meat in 
separate pot with three pints water. Let the latter cook quickly. Skim 
when it begins to boil; add barley; skim again. Fry the chopped vege- 
tables in the hot butter five minutes, drain, add to the meat, simmer 
three hours. Strain the water in which the bones were simmered, set 
aside for a moment. Put in the saucepan the butter left from frying 
the vegetables, melt and add the flour. When smooth, pour in. gradually 
the liquid from the bones. Add to the broth, add salt, parsley and one- 
half saltspoon pepper, simmer 10 minutes and serve. As this broth is 
served without straining it is always well to boil bones separately. 

Split Pea Soup. — Wash a pint of split peas and cover with tepid 
water, adding a pinch of soda, and let remain over night to swell. In 
the morning put them in a kettle with three quarts of cold water, adding 
half a pound of lean salt pork cut into slices, also a teaspoonful of salt 
and a little pepper. Cook slowly for three hours, stirring occasionally 
till the peas are all dissolved, adding a little more boiling water to keep 
up the quantity 'as it boils away. Strain through a colander. Serve with 
small squares of toasted bread. 



13 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Squirrel Soup. — Allow one large or two small squirrels, well washed 
and jointed, to two quarts of cold water and two teaspoonfuls (level) 
of salt. Put to cook directly after breakfast in a stone pipkin or enam- 
eled kettle. Cover closely and set on the back of the range to simmer — 
not boil. After two hours add the corn from two ears, two small Irish 
potatoes, one-half cupful of Lima beans, three sprigs of parsley, three 
celery stalks and one-half cupful of sliced okra. Keep closely covered, 
and as the water evaporates add enough to keep the original two quarts. 
When the squirrels bave cooked to rags strain through a coarse colander 
to remove the troublesome little bones. Return to the soup kettle, cover 
and continue to simmer until nearly time to serve. Then thicken with 
p dessertspoonful of butter rolled in a dessertspoonful of flour. Those 
who like may add a teaspoonful of powdered sassafras leaves. Have two 
slices of toast cut into inch squares, fried in butter and placed in the 
bottom of a hot tureen. Pour over them the soup, boiling hot, and 
serve immediately. 

Puree of Tomatoes. — Cook the contents of a can of tomatoes for 15 
minutes, then rub through a colander. Return to the fire and season with 
salt and pepper to taste, and a little sugar. Rub three tablespoonfuls of 
butter into one tablespoonful of cornstarch, and stir this smooth paste 
into the strained tomatoes. Cook, stirring steadily, until smooth and 
thick. Have ready heated in a saucepan a quart of rich milk into which 
has been stirred a pinch of baking soda. To this add, gradually, the 
thickened tomato liquor, beating the milk constantly as you do so. 
Serve immediately, putting a great spoonful of unsweetened whipped 
cream on the surface of each plate of soup. 

Vegetable Cream Soups.— Scald three cupfuls of milk. Rub together 
one tablespoonful of butter and two tablespoonfuls of flour, cook until 
it bubbles; add the hot milk gradually to this, and cook for five minutes, 
stirring until thick and smooth. Blend some of this cream with a cup- 
ful of cooked vegetable, mashed to a smooth pulp, mix all together, and 
simmer for five minutes, seasoning appropriately. Potato soup should 
have a little celery and onion cooked in the milk, and when ready to 
serve some finely-chopped parsley should be scattered on top. Celery, 
asparagus, green peas or beans, carrots, spinach, cucumbers and lettuce 
are all good in such soup ; all must first be cooked and reduced to a 
smooth pulp. Bread cut into dice and browned in butter is often added 
when the soup is ready to serve. 



CHAPTER II. 

FISH. 

All small fish are best fried, and many large fish are excellent cooked 
in the same way. The fish should be well cleaned; if small left whole, 
if large cut into neat pieces. Beat an egg with a tablespoonful of cold 
water; dip the fish in this, then roll in bread crumbs or cornmeal. Cook 
in plenty of fat, which must be boiling hot when put in. Baking and 
boiling are both excellent methods of cooking fish, but very soft fish 
should never be boiled. The recipes given below refer mainly to canned 
and salt fish, because these are more helpful in an emergency. 

Clam Chowder. — Take the liquor from fifty clams, put it on the stove 
to heat. Cut into dice ^ pound salt pork, brown it in the frying pan, 
and add to the clam liquor. I'cel and cut into dice three quarts of ripe 
tomatoes and half the quantity of potatoes. Cut up 50 clams, and let all 
the ingredients boil slowly for two or three hours. Half hour before 
serving add half a dozen large crackers rolled fine. 

Clam Gumbo. — In one large tablespoonful of lard fry one finely- 
chopped onion, add one cupful of chopped cooked ham, one tablespoonful 
of chopped green pepper, four tomatoes, skinned and cut in pieces, one 
pint of okra, stemmed and sliced, one scant teaspoonful of salt and one 
quart of water or broth. Simmer for an hour, add one dozen finely 
chopped clams, simmer 15 minutes, and serve. 

Clam Pie. — From a half pound of rather fat salt pork trim off the 
rind and cut in slices, then in dice. Slowly fry this, and when the fat 
is well drawn out and just beginning to color add half of a small onion 
cut fine. When golden brown add one quart of raw, diced potatoes, 
one pint of boiling water and one-quarter of a teaspoonful of black pep- 
per. Cover and cook slowly until the potatoes are almost tender. Take 
from the fire, add one solid pint of raw clams cut in quarters and theii- 
strained juice. Turn into a deep well-greased baking dish. While this 
mixture is cooking mix and sift together one pint and a half of flour, 
a .half teaspoonful of salt and two teaspoonfuls of baking powder. 
Mix to a soft dough with sweet milk, and roll out not over a half inch 
thick. Cut in small round biscuits. Place these close together over the 
top of the pie, brush with milk and bake in a hot oven for 35 minutes. 

Roast Clams. — Wash the clams and drain them in a colander for a 
few minutes, then lay them in a large dripping pan and put the pan into 
a very hot oven. As soon as the shells begin to open, the clams are 



14 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

cooked; it takes from seven to 10 minutes to roast them. Have a cov- 
ered dish hot, and drop the clams into it as soon as they are taken from 
the shell. Spread over them a mustard cream sauce and serve at once. 
To make the sauce: Put one cup of milk over the fire in a double 
boiler. When boiling, gradually stir into it three tablespoonfuls of but- 
ter, one of flour, and one teaspoonful of dry mustard that have been 
beaten to a creamy mass. Season with salt and pepper and return to the 
fire; cook three minutes, and it is ready to serve. Thin slices of brown 
bread, buttered, are served with roast clams. 

Baked Fish. — Bluefish, cod, or haddock are the best fish to bake. 
Clean the fish and make a stuffing as follows: Soak stale bread in cold 
water for 20 minutes. Press dry, and season with one Qgg, one table- 
spoonful melted butter and a small quantity of sage, or the prepared 
poultry dressing, or a little onion juice, as preferred. When the stuf- 
fing has been thoroughly mixed, fill the fish and sew up with needle and 
thread. Flour the fish well and salt it. Lay a few thin slices of salt pork 
into the bottom of the baking dish, also a few slices on top .of the 
fish. Baste it often with the liquor which cooks out of it, adding a lit- 
tle water it there is not enough. Allow 15 minutes to the pound for 
bakmg fish. Have a moderate oven, as, if very hot, it will not cook 
well in the middle. 

New England Codfish. — Select a whole fish, and put it to soak in 
cold water over night; in the mormng wash it clean and cut off the*fins 
and tail. Cook the fish whole; if you have not got a fish kettle place it 
in a large milk pan partly filled with water. Cover the pan closely and 
set over a kettle of hot water. It will cook very slowly in this way, say 
five or six hours, according to the size of the fish, but it will be done 
properly when ready for the table. Serve it whole, placing it on a hot 
platter. Indeed, one of the essentials of a good salt fish dinner is to 
have everything hot, not only the fish and vegetables, but plates and 
dishes as well. The dish on which your fish is served must be an ample 
one, and around the fish you will place a garnish of nicely sliced beets 
and carrots. With the fish you will serve pork scraps and &gg sauce 
and boiled potatoes. The pork should be cut into dice and fried a rich 
brown. To make the tgg sauce, take two eggs that have been boiled 
10 minutes, remove the shell, and cut into little pieces, placing them in 
the sauce dish. Blend a piece of butter the size of an egg with a table- 
spoonful of flour, and when the fish is ready to serve, pour over a coffee- 
cupful of boiling water, stir, and pour into the sauce dish with the egg 
and stir again. If the sauce is too thick, add still more boiling water. 
When you have not time to cook a salt fish for dinner and desire an 
emergency dish, try salt fish in cream prepared as follows: Shred a 
cupful of salt cod, or, if you prefer, use the prepared article, place it in 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 15 

a stewpan over the fire in cold water to cover, and let it come to a boil 
for a couple of minutes; pour off the water, add to the fish one pint 
of sweet milk, and when this boils thicken with flour wet with milk; 
let it boil four or five minutes, being careful it does not scorch, and 
serve in a hot, deep dish. Serve pickled beets with this dish, and boiled 
potatoes. 

Cuban Codfish. — Pick into fine shreds a cupful of freshened codfish. 
Cut an onion into thin slices and lightly brown in a saucepan with a 
tablespoonful of butter. Add the fish and pour in just enough water 
to cover. Add a part of a chopped green pepper and a half can of to- 
matoes. Cover closely and simmer for an hour. If the tomatoes are 
very juicy, less water is required. Cream a rounded teaspoonful of but- 
ter and one of flour; stir into the fish until smooth and cooked; turn the 
mixture upon thin slices of buttered toast. 

Delicate Fishballs. — Boil the quantity of codfish that would be re- 
quired, changing the water once that it may not be too salt. While the 
fish is hot pick it very fine, so that it will be feathery. It cannot be done 
fine enough with a fork, and should be picked by hand. At the same 
time have hot boiled potatoes ready, mash them thoroughly and make 
them creamy with milk and a good-sized lump of butter. To three cup- 
fuls of mashed potatoes take 1^ cupful of fish; the fish should not be 
packed down. Beat one ^^g lightly and stir into the other ingredients 
and season to taste. Beat the mixture well together and until light, then 
mold it into small balls, handling lightly and before frying roll the balls 
in flour. Fry them in smoking hot fat until a gold color. 

Mexican Codfish. — Fry to a pale yellow one small onion, chopped 
fine, in three tablespoonfuls of butter; add two tablespoonfuls of flour, 
half a green pepper, chopped fine, and one cupful of stewed and sifted 
tomato pulp. When the sauce reaches the boiling point, add half a 
pound of salt codfish, which has been freshened for 24 hours in cold 
water and slowly simmered until it will readily separate into flakes. 

Codfish Alound. — Make one quart of good mashed potatoes without 
anj-- salt; add a pint of picked boiled codfish. Season with pepper; beat 
well together, make into a mound with a depression in center on "a bak- 
ish dish, and set in the oven to brown. When brought to the table, pour 
a few tablespoonfuls of cream sauce in center of mound, and garnish 
with, hard-boiled .eg%. Serve with boiled beets and, if desired, salt pork 
or bacon cut into tiny squares and fried crisp, which, with the fat fried 
out, is poured into a gravy bowl. This makes a hearty and satisfying 
meal. 

Biscay Salt Cod. — Bone two pounds of salt cod and soak in cold 
water for 12 hours. Place in a saucepan, cover with salt water and let 
heat gradually to boiling point; then add fresh water and let boil again. 



16 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Take out and drain. Chop two onions and one green pepper quite fine 
and cook for five minutes in butter or oil. Add one sliced tomato or 
half-cupful of stewed tomatoes, one clove of garlic and a small chili 
pepper. Add to these three pints of broth, a small bunch of parslej^, 
three tablespoonfuls of tomato catsup and a pint of small potatoes 
(peeled) or the same quantity of potato balls. Cook until the potatoes 
are just done, add the cod and cook five minutes longer. 

Salt Codfish Chowder. — Cut one-fourth pound of salt pork into bits 
and try out the fat in a frying pan; in this brown two medium-sized 
onions, sliced. Wash and drain a pound of codfish, cut or picked into 
bits; cover with cold water and set on back of range to heat, but not 
boil. After two hours add a pint and a half of potatoes pared and sliced, 
and a dash of pepper. Add a cupful of water to the onions and pork 
and strain over the potatoes. When the potatoes are tender add one 
cupful each of scalded cream and milk. Pour the chowder over six 
crackers broken into halves and serve. 

Finnan Haddie, Caledonian Style. — Soak one-half of a finnan haddie 
weighing four pounds, two hours in milk and water to cover, using 
equal parts, having the liquid at a uniformly even tepid temperature. 
This is best accomplished by having the fish in a drip pan on the back 
of the range. Trim the fish to fit a copper platter or graniteware drip- 
ping pan, by cutting off flank and a two-inch piece from the tail end. 
Pour over a cream sauce, and surround with six halves of potatoes of 
uniform size smoothly pared. Cook until the potatoes are soft, the time 
required being about 40 minutes, basting with the cream sauce three 
times during the cooking. Cream must enter into the composition of a 
real cream sauce. For the cream sauce for the finnan haddie, melt two 
tablespoonfuls of butter, add two tablespoonfuls of flour, and stir until 
well blended, then pour on gradually, while stirring constantly, one cupful 
of milk and one-half cupful of cream. Bring to the boiling point, and 
season with a few grains of pepper. No salt will be needed, for it must 
be remembered that finnan haddie is salted. 

Finnan Haddie in Cream. — Cover a pound of the fish with cold water 
and let come to a simmer, drain, then cut into moderate-sized pieces. In 
the meantime prepare a cream sauce made by melting a tablespoonful 
of butter to which is added a tablespoonful of flour, a scant saltspoonful 
of salt, a dash of cayenne, two teaspoonfuls of lemon juice and one-half 
cupful each of milk and cream. Add the pieces of fish, let the whole 
come to a boil and serve. This creamed fish is also very nice if put 
in a baking dish, covered with bread crumbs, and browned in the oven. 
Browned Salt Mackerel. — Freshen two fish by soaking over night, 
wash in fresh water in the morning and squeeze over the flesh side the 
juice of one-half a lemon. Lay one of the fish skin side down in baking 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 17 

dish and cover with dressing made of one cupful bread crumbs, one table- 
spoonful butter (scant), pinch of pepper, a little grated lemon peel and 
one-fourth cupful of cream. Lay the other fish on dressing, skin side up, 
and baste well with hot water and melted butter. Put into a hot oveh 
for 20 minutes, then cover with bread crumbs, dot with bits of butter 
and put back in the oven till nicely browned. Carefully dish without 
disturbing the layers and serve with thin lemon slices and parsley as a 
garnish. 

Oyster Chowder. — Fry together two ounces of salt pork and one 
onion, sliced. Parboil one pint of sliced potatoes five minutes and drain. 
Look over carefully one pint of oysters, pour over one-half cupful of 
water and heat to the boiling point; skim out the oysters and pour the 
liquor over the potatoes, add the pork and onions and cook the potatoes 
until tender, adding a little more water if necessary; add the oysters, 
one pint of milk and one-half cupful of fine bread crumbs. Season with 
one teaspoonful of salt and half-teaspoonful of pepper and pour in the 
serving dish. 

Oyster Stew. — Put one quart of oysters in a colander, and pour over 
three-fourths of a cupful of cold water, reserving the liquor. Pick over 
tlie oysters, being careful that no particles of shells adhere to the tough 
muscles. Heat the reserved liquor to the boiling point, strain through a 
double thickness of cheese cloth, add the oysters, and cook, stirring oc- 
casionally, until the oysters are plump and the edges begin to curl. Re- 
move the oysters with a skimmer to a heated tureen, and add one-fourth 
of a cupful of butter, one-half tablespoonful of salt, one-eighth of a 
teaspoonful of pepper, the oyster liquor, strained a second time through 
a double thickness of cheese clotji, and four cupfuls of scalded milk. 

Baked Pickerel. — Clean the fish carefully and lay on a rack in a 
dripping pan; dredge with a teaspoonful of salt, several dashes of pepper, 
and a little flour. Bake carefully, basting every 10 minutes until well 
done, with hot water to which a tablespoonful of butter has been added. 
Make the sauce with half a cup of cream and half a cup of the basting 
liquid in which the fish was cooked ; thicken with a teaspoonful of butter 
and a tablespoonful of flour ; let the sauce boil up once, then add a ta- 
blespoonful of chopped parsley. Pour part of the sauce around the 
fish on a platter, and serve the remainder in a gravy boat. 

Quahaug Pie. — Remove the loose brown skin and black part from a 
quart of sea clams and chop the remainder fine. Scald a cup of milk, 
the liquid from the clams and enough water to make a pint in all, and 
thicken it with a tablespoonful each of flour and butter cooked to a 
smooth paste; then add pepper and salt to taste and two finely-chopped 
hard-boiled eggs, and lastly, the chopped clams. Line a meat pie dish 
with pie crust, then add a thin layer of cracker crumbs, the prepared 



18 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

clams, and sprinkle this over with another layer of cracker crumbs and 
cover with a good, rich crust, leaving several openings so the steam 
can escape. Bake about an hour in a hot oven until well browned. 

Salmon Chowder. — Chop coarsely and brown together in a kettle or 
saucepan, one-fourth pound of salt pork and one onion. Add one pint 
of raw potatoes, chopped or cut in dice, which have stood for half an 
hour in cold water. Season, barely cover with boiling water, and sim- 
mer for half an hour; then add a can of salmon, drained and flaked, 
two or three broken crackers and one pint of scalded milk or cream, 
with two teaspoons of butter. This may be varied by the addition of a 
can of tomatoes, or a shredded pepper or both. 

Creamed Salmon. — Put one tablespoonful of butter into a saucepan; 
when melted add one tablespoonful of flour, half a teaspoonful of salt, 
a dash of paprika and half a cup of milk. Cook until smooth, then add 
a small can of salmon finely minced, one tablespoonful lemon juice and 
a little grated nutmeg. Remove from the fire and add yolks of three 
eggs, well beaten; whip whites of the eggs stiff and fold in carefully. 
Butter small molds or a baking dish, place in hot water in a dripping 
pan and bake from 10 to 25 minutes. 

Escalloped Salmon. — Put one pint of milk to heat with a tablespoon- 
ful of butter. Moisten a tablespoonful of flour and stir in; when thick 
like cream remove from fire. Drain the liquid from the salmon and 
remove bone, pick it all up into fine pieces with a fork. Butter a bak- 
ish dish, put in a layer of fine cracker crumbs, then half the salmon, an- 
other layer of cracker crumbs, and half the thickened milk. Then add 
the remaining salmon, a layer of crumbs and the remaining milk. Bake 
half an hour. 

Salmon Loaf. — One can of salmon drained and minced. Five table- 
spoonfuls of butter, four eggs well beaten; half cup of bread crumbs, 
salt and pepper to taste. Mix all together, and steam one hour in but- 
tered mold. 

Fried Smelts. — Do not have the heads removed when the marketman 
cleans the fish. Wipe the outside of each with a damp cloth and then 
roll in Indian meal, then in beaten ^gg and then again into the meal; lay 
in a ivy'mg basket or place a few in a kettle of hot lard to cook until 
the coating is brown ; remove them and drain on to plain paper, and when 
serving arrange with garnishing of sliced lemon and parsley. If the 
basket is used place the fish side by side in it and drop into the kettle of 
hot lard until the fish are browned. 

Sportsman's Trout. — Take two fresh young trout, clean, wash and 
then wipe dry. Use one-half teaspoon of salt and two or three dashes 
of pepper over the fishes. Put in a pan to fit and fill to the level with 
cream. Bake a light brown, when the fish will have absorbed the cream. 



CHAPTER III. 

MEATS. 

I am the dinner table ; upon my ample breast 

Three times a day the housewife puts out her very best. 

Three times a day they gather — old grandpa at the head, 

Thrice' daily ofEers up his thanks for life and daily bread. 

Then how the knives they clatter and how my load grows light, 

And how the housewife's goodly fare doth disappear from sight, 

I am the dinner table, and while my timbers stand 

I'll still remain headquarters for our good household band. 

Elaborate instructions for marketing are usually given under this head, 
but the farm housekeeper meets with different conditions. If meat is 
locally slaughtered it is likely to be much better in quality than that from 
the great packing centers. In pork particularly she has a great advantage 
over her town sisters. It should be remembered that in beef and mutton 
many of the cheaper and tougher cuts are nutritious and well flavored, 
but they need careful preparation, and especially long slow cooking. 
Tough meat should never be roasted, broiled or fried; it should be cooked 
gently in a closed vessel, with such seasonings as will best develop flavor. 
There are still some cooks who prepare meat hastily in slightly thickened 
water, and then wonder why the family dislikes stews. With long, slow 
cooking in a casserole or closed vessel, and a proper admixture of herbs 
and seasoning, the humble stew becomes a delicious ragout. 

Bacon, Cold Roast. — Select a square piece weighing three or four 
pounds, soak it over night. The next morning put it on to boil, allowing 
it to simmer very gently three-quarters of an hour to the pound ; then 
let it go cool in the water in which it was cooked. When cold drain, 
remove the skin, rub the fat well with sugar, pour over it some cider 
vinegar, and roast in the oven until brown. When cold cut into thin 
slices ; it should be tender and delicate in flavor. 

Beef, Braised. — Procure a piece of four pounds, make incisions in it 
an inch and a half apart, and stuff them with a dressing made of two 
tablespoonfuls of finely-minced onion, three tablespoonfuls of chopped 
parsley, a teaspoonful of sweet basil, a half teaspoonful of thyme, a half 
teaspoonful of pepper and two teaspoonfuls of salt. Dredge a table- 
spoonful of flour over the meat, lay three thin slices of bacon in the 
bottom of a deep pan, place the meat in, lay three more slices of bacon 
over the top, cover with a well-fitting lid and shut up in a moderate oven 
to brown. After it has been cooking for two hours add two carrots (or 
four small ones), one turnip, three stalks of celery, four salsifies and one 



20 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

onion, all sliced. Add also three tablespoonfuls of tomato catsup, one 
minced green pepper, a teaspoonful of salt. If no green pepper is at 
hand use a few shreds of red pepper pod. A coffeecupful of boiling water 
should be added with the vegetables. Fit the cover on closely again and 
leave in the oven for another hour, or until both meat and vegetables are 
tender. To serve, place the meat on a hot platter and arrange the vege- 
tables by the spoonful about it; there should be just gravy enough to 
hold the vegetables together. 

Beef, Corned. — Here is an old home recipe for corning beef, which 
will be especially useful to tliose who kill their own beef cattle as well 
as pork. To every hundred pounds of beef take nine pounds of salt, four 
pounds of sugar or two quarts of good molasses, two ounces of soda, one 
ounce of saltpeter, and just enough water to cover the meat — about four 
or five gallons. Strew some salt over the bottom of a barrel ; mix about 
half the am.ount of salt given with half the given amount of sugar or 
molasses, and rub each piece of meat thoroughly with it before placing it 
in the barrel. Dissolve the saltpeter and soda together in hot water, add 
the remainder of the salt and sugar and about four or five gallons of 
cold water. Pour this over the meat. Place a board on top of the meat, 
with a weight heavy enough to keep it under the brine. It may be kept 
an indefinite time in the brine, but is salt enough to cook after five or 
six days' corning. 

Spiced corned beef is made as follows, the recipe being an old one, 
we think of German origin : Rub twelve pounds of a round of beef with 
half a pound of coarse sugar. Let it stand for two days, turning it two 
or three times. Take a large teaspoonful of mace, a teaspoonful of black 
pepper, two of cloves, half a teaspoonful of cayenne, one small grated 
nutmeg, two ounces of juniper berries and one-half ounce of saltpeter. 
Stir all these seasonings together, adding a teaspoonful of sugar and rub 
the mixture thoroughly into the meat and all over it. Then let it stand 
for three days longer. At the end of this time rub half a pound of fine 
salt into the meat. Finally, let it stand for twelve days, rubbing the meat 
and turning it daily. If it is to be cooked immediately and not dried, wash 
it, but do not soak it. Lay it in a pot that just fits it, and pour over it a 
quart and a half of water. When it comes to the boiling point skim it 
carefully, add a carrot, a small onion, a bay leaf and a few sprigs of par- 
sley. Let it simmer very gently for four and a half h6urs. Take it from 
the fire, put it under a heavy weight and let it cool in the liquid in which 
it was cooked. Serve in thin slices when perfectly cold. 

Corned Beef, Shaker Style. — This recipe is given under the name of 
"bacca," in Good Housekeeping : Pound down close in a barrel 100 
pounds of the round of beef cut in lO-pound pieces, with a mixture of 
lour pounds sugar, two ounces saltpeter, two ounces soda bicarbonate, and 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 21 

four quarts table salt sprinkled under, over and between. It will make 
brine without water. After one week, a piece of the top of the round, 
sliced and broiled, will be found tender and delicious. The bottom of 
the round, boiled till tender and sliced thin when cold, resembles ham, 
but is more choice in flavor. 

Corned Beef, Savory Style.— Choose a piece of brisket of corned beef 
weighing four to five pounds and about three times as long as wide; 
wash, season with a small haif teaspoonful of pepper, then roll it up and 
tie very tight. Put the beef in a kettle with cold water to cover, and 
let slowly come to a boil, then pour it off and replace with more cold 
water to cover; add half a cupful of vinegar, a small onion, peeled, in 
which is inserted six cloves, half a red pepper, a blade of mace and a 
stalk of celery. Boil gently, allow half an hour to each pound. Serve hot. 
If the meat is preferred cold, it should be allowed to cool in the broth 
in which it was cooked. 

Curried Beef. — Melt in a saucepan two tablespoonfuls of butter, add 
two onions sliced, and fry until brown; then add two tablespoonfuls of 
curry powder. Cut cold roast beef in pieces about an inch square, put it 
in the saucepan and add half a cupful of sweet milk. Simmer for 30 
minutes. Just before serving add the juice of a lemon. Send to the 
table on a platter bordered with boiled rice. 

Beef Loaf. — Take two pounds of round steak and half a pound of 
suet, both chopped fine; add two eggs, one cupful of bread crumbs that 
have been softened in cold water, one small onion, chopped fine, one-half 
cupful of sweet milk 1^-2 teaspoonful of salt, and a fourth of a tea- 
spoonful of pepper ; mix all together and shape into a loaf, put in a roast* 
ing pan and bake in a moderate oven 2^ hours, baste frequently; serve 
with tomato sauce. 

Beefsteak Chowder. — Cut a pound and one-half of round steak in strips 
or cubes. Cut three or four ounces of fat pork in small pieces and cook 
in a hot frying pan with an onion sliced very thin. When both are 
browned add a quart of boiling water, simmer five minutes, pour the 
whole over the steak, bring to the boiling point, boil for five minutes and 
then cook slowly until the meat is tender. Have ready five large potatoes 
peeled, sliced, scalded in boiling water, drained and rinsed in cold water. 
Add the potatoes, one teaspoonful of salt and saltspoonful of pepper. 
Cook until the potatoes are tender, then add one and one-half cupful of 
rich milk and a little more salt if necessary. Heat to the boiling point 
and pour over pilot biscuit or thick crackers which have been dipped for 
a second in hot water. 

English Beefsteak Pudding. — Make a crust by thoroughly mixing two 
cupfuls of finely-chopped beef suet in three cupfuls of flour; add half 
teaspoonful of salt, and mix with cold water into a dough with the con-

sistency of biscuit. Roll out the paste to the thickness of half an inch. 
Butter an earthen pudding bowl, and line with the paste. Take flank or 
round steak, cut into one-inch pieces, season with pepper and salt, and 
fill the dish. Pour in as much cold water as will find its way in around 
the meat, then cover it with paste, having moistened the edges to make 
them stick together. Cover with a cloth, well floured, leaving a little 
room for the pudding to swell. Put it into a pot of boiling water, and 
let it boil three hours, or put it in a steamer, and allow four hours' 
cooking. When fully cooked the meat should be very tender, with an 
abundance of rich clotted gravy. The addition of a few oysters with 
the meat forms a palatable change. Serve with boiled carrots and turnips. 

Spiced Beef. — This makes a desirable cold dish for luncheon or tea, 
or for Sunday dinner in Summer. Select a piece of the flank, trim off 
the coarse skin, lay it flat on the table, and, with a knife, spread over it 
the following mixture : One teaspoonful ground mustard, one teaspoonful 
celery salt, half teaspoonful black pepper, pinch of red pepper, mixed to 
a smooth paste with vinegar. Then roll up the meat like a jelly cake, the 
spice inside, tie it up, tie it in a cloth like a pudding. Put it into boiling 
water, and let it boil 2^ hours. When cooked lift the kettle off the 
stove, and allow the water to cool before removing the meat. Do not 
lake the cloth off until cold, then slice the meat for serving. 

Waverly Collared Beef. — Corn a six-pound piece of the thick part of 
the brisket by putting it in brine strong enough to float an tg^, to which 
is added a heaping teaspoonful of saltpeter, one of brown sugar and a 
saltspoon of red pepper. Leave it in five or six days in Summer; eight 
or 10 in Winter. Use an earthen crock, and turn the meat every two or 
three days. Grate two large carrots, a good-sized stick of horseradish, 
and chop fine a large bunch of parsley; mix all together, and spread a 
thick layer on the corned beef, keeping it well to the middle, as it presses 
out when you roll ; if the meat is not long, and difficult to roll nicely, cut 
a few pockets in it and fill with the dressing; then roll very tightly, 
fastening with skewers and bmding with strong string round and round. 
Any of the dressing that has squeezed out press back into the open ends 
of the roll ; remove the skewers ; then tie up in cheesecloth, cover with 
cold water, bring slowly to a simmer, and let it cook at this point four 
hours. Remove the cheesecloth, put the meat on a tray, place a heavy 
weight on it and leave it over night. Cut off the string. Serve cold, 
cutting thin slices off the end, showing the dressing. 

Brown Stew. — A piece of tough steak. can be very well cooked in this 
way : Brown a tablespoonfui of sugar in the kettle and add a sliced 
onion; when brown cool and add for each pound of beef cut in small bits 
s tablespoonfui of flour and one of butter or suet. Add a pint of boiling 
water, stir well and add the bits of meat. Put in half of a bay leaf or a 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 23 

pinch of celery seed. Cook very slowly for an hour. Just before serving 
add a teaspoonful of salt. The meat will be tender, the flavor excellent. 
The browned sugar, or caramel, as cooks call it, does not give a percep- 
tibly sweet flavor, but gives ? different taste, and makes brown gravy. 

Brunswick Stew. — Stew a large fowl until the meat leaves the bone; 
remove skin, gristle and bones and chop the meat in coarse pieces. Return 
to the liquor; add a pint of corn scraped from the ears, a pint of young 
Lima beans, three cupfuls of tomato, a good-sized onion, minced fine, a 
pint of young okras, a small red pepper, minced, a little celery seed, two 
tablespoonfuls of butter and salt, pepper and Worcestershire sauce to 
taste. Simmer until okra is tender and then serve. The addition of n 
little paprika just before the stew is taken up improves it greatly. 

Belgian Hare. — If you broil see that the hares are young, under four 
or five months, and therefore tender. After a brief soaking in water into 
which no soda or salt has been put (if the hares are young they have 
no unpalatable flavor and consequently great care must be taken to pre- 
serve their natural delicacy), dry well with a clean cloth, and gash them 
down the back through the thickest portion; then flatten each, place it 
on a gridiron, and broil it over a bed of coals, turning often, or you may 
lay them smooth on the bottom of a dripping pan and cook in a hot 
oven without basting; oil the pan slightly with a little sweet dripping, 
or a bit of fresh butter; they should be done in half an hour. 

Stewed. — Cut the hares into joints, drop into a pot and cover with 
boiling water; then slice in an onion and a bit of bacon, and stew slowly 
one hour or until tender. As old hares are best stewed, it will do no 
harm to put in a young chicken, stewing all together. At the end of 
half an hour add a few potatoes, peeled, and cut in quarters, and, if liked, 
some small bits of light paste, after the potatoes get fairly boiling. When 
all are done, stir in a little cream thickened with white flour, boil up a 
moment and dish for the table. 

Fried. — Disjoint, cut uniform pieces, cover with boiling water, and 
let it simmer until quite tender. Then remove carefully to a dry dish. 
Dredge well with flour, and drop into very hot butter to brown. Serve 
with gravy made from the liquor in which it was boiled and cream. Two 
tablespoonfuls of vinegar added while boiling are an improvement. 

Roast Hare. — Make a dressing of fine dry bread crumbs; part graham 
is best. Add to the crumbs a small lump of fresh butter, a little dry 
sage (or other herb, if preferred), and moisten well with tepid water, 
stirring well as you add it. Do not put in too much water ; have the 
dressing light and flaky, not wet and heavy. The large and delicious 
liver of the hare, having been thoroughly steamed will add an unwonted 
zest if chopped into bits and put into the stuffing. Fill the hares with 
this, leaving plenty of room for the dressing to swell, sew up, put the 



24 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

hares into a dripping pan, add a cupful of boiling water, and roast as 
slowly as possible during the first half hour. Baste every 15 or 20 min- 
utes, turning as needed, and if any part browns too fast, cover it with. a 
clean napkin wet in warm water and folded two or three times. Allow 
from one to two hours for roasting; test with a fork to ascertain when 
the hares are done; take them out of the pan and make the gravy, drain 
the grease all off and set the pan on the stove ; then put in any tid-bits 
(as the liver, etc.), and the liquor in which they are boiled; thicken with 
a little browned flour wet with milk or water, and boil up a moment. 

Canning Meat. — Half cook the meat in a kettle, cut meat from the 
bcnes. If this is done while the meat is hot, wring out a cloth from 
cold or tepid water, fold in several thicknesses, and set under the glass 
can, letting cloth come up about an inch around sides of can, and it will 
not break, no matter how hot the meat may be. If you spill more broth 
on the cloth be sure to wring out extra water from it, for if the cloth 
is sopping wet, the can will break. Having filled can with meat, pour in 
all the broth the can will hold, and see that it is salted and peppered 
just right for the table. Screw on cover without rubber and, if hot put in 
kettle partly filled with hot water, putting a tin in bottom of kettle to 
set cans on. Three quarts can be put in com.mon-sized kettle. Cover 
with a well-fitting cover that will keep in the steam, and keep boiling for 
two hours. Take out one can at a time, and at once put on a good rubber. 
If you want to keep the meat for several months, if it is chicken, veal or 
beef, have hot melted beef suet and fill the cans even full. If you only 
care to keep the meat for two or three weeks fill up even full with boiling 
broth. This work must be done with dispatch, not letting the contents 
of the can cool in the least. Screw on the cover to the last limit, and 
if your covers and rubbers are not defective your meat will keep per- 
fectly. In canning pork there is nearly always sufficient grease to broth; 
if not the can may be filled with lard. 

Canning Meat in Tins. — Trim off all surplus tallow from meat, and 
either boil or roast the beef, using but little salt and pepper, preferably 
none at all, as these will attack the tin ; meat can be spiced, etc., when 
removed from can to serve. When cooked remove from liquid and trim 
off from bones. If liquid is too greasy let it get cold and then remove 
tallow. While again heating liquid and meat boiling hot get the cans and 
covers ready, the covers to be pierced by an awl in the center. Use the 
friction top tin can only, for keeping meat through the Summer and dog 
days. You can use glass jars to keep same till May, but they are risky 
during warm weather. When meat and liquid are hot pack meat into the 
cans — any size you wish — not quite full, and pour liquid over same so as 
to cover meat somewhat, then place on the covers good and tight. Put 
cans into oven and bake one to two hours. If cans are too full, liquid 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 25 

will ooze through vent. The baking will drive out every particle or atom 
of air through vent, and is absolutely necessary for safety. When nearly 
done baking liquefy some paraffin or sealing wax, and heat a soldering 
iron. The paraffin is t-o seal cover airtight around edge, and the soldering 
iron to use with solder to close up vent opening in center. Take out of 
oven a can at a time and solder vent opening as quickly as possible, then 
paraffin the edge of cover. Place cans — after finishing job — where it is 
dry and cool. A steer can be packed into about 50 or 60 quart cans. 

Chicken Baked in Milk. — ^Dress and joint a chicken of four to six 
pounds, dust each piece with salt and pepper, and roll in fiour. Put the 
chicken in a roasting pan or casserole that it will half fill, then pour over 
it enough sweet milk to cover the chicken completely. Put a close-fitting 
lid on the baker, and put it in the oven, cooking the chicken until tender; 
it will take from two to 2^ hours. This requires but little attention while 
cooking, the meat is tender and juicj-, and the gravy delicious. It is an 
excellent way to cook an elderly fowl; a young bird will, of course, cook 
in a shorter time. As it really gains in flavor by being warmed over, it 
can be cooked on Saturday for the Sunday dinner, thus lessening work. 

Broiled Chicken. — Take- broilers of suitable age or size, dress in the 
usual way, split down the back and remove breast bone^ which can be 
easily done by running finger along it. Place right side up in dripping 
pan, season with plenty of butter, pepper and salt ; put in a hot oven 
for 20 minutes to "draw" or heat well through. Take out ; if cooking 
with gas turn, and put under flame a few minutes to brown ; then brown 
the top, but do not burn. If cooking on stove with fuel proceed the same 
way on toaster or gridiron. 

Broiled Chicken, O. W. Mapes's Recipe. — The first essential of course 
is to have a nice fat chicken. This should be split through the back and 
laid in a shallow basin. Now place the basin containing the chicken in a 
steamer and steam for an hour and a half. The basin will catch all the 
juices which drip from the meat. These should all be saved and used in 
making the gravy. As soon as it is steamed sufficiently place in a well- 
buttered pan and fry until well browned ; remove the meat and add the 
juices from steaming to make a good gravy. This method never has 
failed to bring satisfaction to both cook and guests. Possibly it would 
be equally as good with older birds by allowing more time in the steaming. 
Spring Chicken Fried in Cream. — Put a pint of rich cream in a frying 
pan over a moderate fire till it begins to color, dip the different parts of 
the chicken in flour, fry in the cream on each side till it is a delicate brown. 
When done put it on a hot platter, pour another half pint of cream into 
the pan, let it boil one minute, add a saltspoonful of salt, a dash of 
pepper, then pour it over the chicken. Serve garnished with sprigs of 
parsley and a dish of puffed potato slices. 



26 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Jugged Chicken.— Cut the bird up as for a fricassee. To every pound 
allow two heaping teaspoonfuls of flour, one scant teaspoonful of salt 
and one-quarter teaspoonful of pepper; mix thoroughly and roll each 
piece of chicken in the mixture, then pack closely in a large bean-pot; 
cover with boiling water and bake in a good oven until tender — from two 
to three hours. When placed in the pot sprinkle in a tablespoonful of 
minced onion. When done remove to a hot platter, thicken the liquor 
for gravy and serve in a boat. 

Chicken Loaf. — Mince fine two cupfuls of cold cooked chicken, one 
pound of lean veal and one-fourth pound of fat salt pork. Work in these 
three beaten eggs, a cupful of seasoned and strained tomato sauce, one 
teaspoonful of grated lemon peel, one teaspoonful of salt, one-fourth 
teaspoonful of paprika and enough cracker crumbs to mold with the hands. 
Press firmly into a large wet bowl, invert carefully into a buttered baking 
pan, removing bowl. Add one cupful of water and one tablespoonful of 
butter to the pan. Sift buttered crumbs lightly over the loaf and cover 
the top and sides with carefully peeled and sliced lemons. Bake V/z 
hour in a moderate oven, browning it nicely before serving. Baste fre- 
quently with the liquor. Serve garnished with lemon slices and parsley. 

Paprika Chicken. — This is a favorite Hungarian dish. Cut a nice 
tender chicken into pieces as for a fricassee; flatten a little, such pieces 
as need it. Season each piece with salt and pepper, and dredge it lightly 
with flour, while you fry a minced onion in two tablespoonfuls of butter. 
Lay the chicken in the butter and onion, cooking for 20 minutes, so it will 
be evenly and thoroughly done. Take up the chicken and stir in an even 
teaspoonful of salt and a very scant teaspoonful of paprika, or half a 
scant teaspoonful of good mild cayenne pepper of any kind. Add last 
of all a cupful of rich cream. Make some dumplings of a pint of sifted 
flour, two teaspoonfuls of baking powder, a saltspoonful of salt and 
butter the size of half an tgg; moisten the dumplings with a cupful of 
milk, and drop them over the sauce. Let them cook well, covered for 
50 minutes, when they will be well puffed up and light. Pour the sauce 
around the chicken and make a circle of the dumplings. If the dumplings 
are steamed over the cream sauce so they do not sink into it they will 
be lighter. 

Panned Fowl with Oysters. — Cut the fowl into pieces suitable for 
serving; lay them in a baking dish, flesh side down; season with a tea- 
spoonful of salt, a fourth of a teaspoonful of pepper and cover with thin 
slices of salt pork. Put one cupful of boiling water in the pan, cover 
closely and bake in a hot oven half an hour (for young chickens). Remove 
the cover and baste every 10 minutes for another half hour, turning the 
pieces so they will brown. Remove to a hot platter, add half a cupful of 
rich milk or cream to the gravy in the pan, first skimming off all fat; 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 27 

place on the top of the range and stir in a tablespoonful of flour and same 
of butter blended together; when it boils add a cupful of well-washed 
(and cleaned from shells) oysters; watch carefully and as soon as the 
oysters are plump remove them from the fire; add a teaspoonful of 
finely-chopped parsley and a tablespoonful of lemon juice. Pour around 
the fowl; garnish with celery tips. An old fowl will require longer 
cooking. 

Chicken Pie, Southern Style. — Select a fowl weighing four or five 
pounds ; clean carefully, singe and put it on in boiling water enough to 
cover it, and let it sim.mer gently until it begins to grow tender. Save 
this broth with the giblets. Now cut the chicken in small pieces ; slice a 
quarter of a pound of fat pork very thin and fry it with the chicken 
until it is brown. After the chicken and pork are fried take them up 
and stir into the pan in which they were cooked a tablespoonful of flour. 
Stir it over the fire until brown ; then add a pint of the chicken broth, a 
teaspoonful of salt, quarter of a teaspoonful of pepper. Stir this gravy 
until it has boiled two minutes and use it for pie. To make the crust : 
Mix together in a bowl with a knife one pound of flour, one teaspoonful 
of salt, two teaspoonfuls of butter, and just enough cold water to hold 
it together. Roll it out about an inch thick; cut a quarter of a pound 
of butter in large slices, and lay it all over the paste; fold it up and 
wrap in a floured towel and put in the ice box for half an hour. Roll 
it out, repeating same with another quarter of a pound of butter; roll it 
to a thickness of half an inch, fold it in three thicknesses and roll it out 
again. If the butter breaks through, fold it again in a towel and cool for 
half an hour before using. Line a deep dish ; then put in alternate layers 
of chicken, pork and sliced raw potatoes ; pour in as much gravy as the 
dish will hold. Sprinkle with a little chopped parsley, a dash more pepper 
and salt, and cover with a top crust, wetting the edges to make them 
adhere. Cut a hole in the top to allow the steam to escape. 

Chicken Potpie with Stirred Dumplings. — Cut up the fowl for serving, 
wash, put in a deep stewpan, and add three pints of boiling water, salt, 
pepper and a bay leaf. Cook one large onion, and about three slices each 
of turnip and carrot, in a tablespoonful of butter, and cook till soft; 
mash and add to stew; then dip out two tablespoonfuls of the fat from 
the stew, put with the butter, and when boiling stir in three tablespoonfuls 
of flour. Stir over the fire till brown, then stir into the chicken to 
thicken it. A year-old chicken will need two hours' cooking; it should 
only simmer, without hard boiling. For dumplings, into a quart of wheat 
flour sift two heaping teaspoonfuls of baking powder and a half tea- 
spoonful of salt. Sift at least three times. Then stir in rich, sweet milk 
to make a batter, not thick as can be stirred nor yet soft enough to run. 
Drop in spoonfuls over the top of the boiling potpie a half hour before 



28 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

dinner time. Should there be so much gravy that the batter would sink 
beneath its surface remove a bowlful. Cover closely and keep constantly 
boiling. Serve the dinner on a large meat platter, arranging the dumplings 
about its border, heaping the meat and potatoes in the center and serving 
the gravy from a gravy boat. In taking up the dumplings tear them apart 
with two forks instead of using a knife or spoon. 

Smothered Chicken. — Have a year-old chicken split as for broiling. 
Wipe dry, spread it liberally with butter all over, dust with flour and 
pepper, and place, skin side down, in a dripping pan (over a meat rack). 
Pour in a cupful boiling water, add a few sprigs of parsley, cover closely 
and bake in a hot oven one hour. Then turn the chicken skin side up, 
sprinkle with a half teaspoonful of salt, and brown uncovered, 10 or 15 
minutes. Cut up the giblets, which have been cooked tender in one pint 
of water, add a level dessertspoonful flour and a lump of butter the size 
of an egg with the water from the giblets, which will be reduced to about 
a cupful, and stir all in the dripping pan, seasoning with a saltspoonful 
of salt, a good dash of pepper, parsley or sweet marjoram. Joint the 
chicken that it may be easily carved, but do* not separate it. Serve on a 
platter with the gravy poured around. 

Victoria Chicken. — Procure a young chicken of three and one-half 
pounds in weight, singe, draw and wash it, cut the chicken into 10 pieces, 
season with half teaspoonful pepper, and half tablespoonful of salt; rub 
the seasoning and the chicken well together. Cut half pound bacon into 
slices, remove the rind and place the bacon in a pan of boiling water, let 
it lie five minutes, then drain. Put the bacon into a saucepan and fry to 
a delicate brown, then take out the bacon. Put the chicken into the bacon 
fat, add half tablespoonful butter, cover and cook slowly for 30 minutes, 
turning the chicken with a fork three times during that time, then lay 
the chicken in a round pan with the slices of bacon between, pour over 
three cups of cream, cover the pan and bake one hour in a medium-hot 
oven. When ready to serve lay the chicken on a hot dish, and lay six 
bread croutons in a circle around the dish, strain the sauce over the 
chicken and serve. 

Deviled Mutton. — This is a nice way to warm up cold roast mutton 6t 
lamb. Put one teaspoonful of chopped onion into a stewpah with otie 
ounce of butter. Place it over a slow fire, keep the onions stirred until 
rather brown, then add some flour, mix it in well and fry for five min- 
utes ; then pour in one-half pint of gravy well seasoned, and let it boil 
until thickened and brown; add one teaspoonful of sugar and one of 
vinegar, one of Worcestershire sauce, a few chopped gherkins and a few 
button mushrooms if at hand; put in the mutton, which has been pre- 
viously sliced in thin slices and perfectly free from fat; let it remain a 
few minutes and simmer, not boil. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 29 

Flank Steak, Rolled. — Spread a steak weighing about 2^^ pounds with 
a dressing composed of V/i cupful bread crumbs — dip the crusts previously 
in boiling water that they may easily crumble — one medium-sized onion, 
two tablespoonfuls canned tomato, one beaten o^gg, one tablespoonful 
butter, one teaspoonful salt, one-quarter teaspooriful pepper. Stir egg 
with bread, add the onion sliced, tomato, butter and seasoning. After 
spreading roll snugly and tie with pieces of string. Lay three slices of 
salt pork on top, place in dripping pan with one-half cupful water. Roast 
slowly one hour. May be eaten hot with gravy, or cold. 

Goulash. — Cut two leeks or onions, small-sized ones, into fine pieces, 
and fry them in hot butter till they are brown. Add one cupful of beef 
broth, a little salt, half a teaspoonful of paprika or red pepper, and 
half a teaspoonful of browned flour. Stir until smooth, then strain. 
Have ready one-half pound of raw steak, cut into quarter-inch squares. 
The better the steak, necessarily, the better tlie result will be, and there- 
fore porterhouse is preferred. Toss the meat into a frying pan just long 
enough to cook the outside, tlien add the sauce. Add two warm boiled 
potatoes, cut into good-sized pieces, and let the pan remain on the back 
of the stove 15 minutes before serving. 

Goose, Braised. — Braised goose is superior to a roast, in the taste of 
many, the bird acquiring flavor from the vegetables with it. The oven 
is the place for the cooking, and a porcelain-lined iron pot or earthen 
cooking crock (either having a tight-fitting cover) gives the best results. 
Prepare the goose as for roasting, but do not stuff. In the baking dish 
put a layer of chopped or sliced onions, celery, turnips, carrots and two 
apples. Sprinkle with a teaspoonful of salt, one of powdered sage and 
six shakes of pepper. Lay the goose upon them, pour over it two cupfuls 
of boiling water, dredge with salt, pepper, powdered sage and flour. Cover 
closely and cc^k slowly for at least four hours (allow 25 minutes to the 
pound). Turn the goose every two hours. Add more water if necessary. 
Less time is required if a roaster is used. When tender, remove the 
goose. Rub the vegetables and gravy through a colander, return to the 
fire and stir in a tablespoonful of browned flour. Boil up once and serve 
in a boat. Garnish the goose with parsley. 

Gumbo. — This takes four hours to make. Put into a kettle two pounds 
of lean soup beef, one-half a chicken that has been jointed, a small ham 
bone, or a good-sized slice of lean bacon, a slice of green pepper and a 
square inch of onion. Add three quarts of water and boil or simmer 
gently, skimming often for two hours. At the end of this time add three 
pints of okra that has first been cut in slices and fried lightly in a very 
small amount of butter, also a large potato cut in pieces, which gradually 
breaks and thickens the soup. An hour later, after frequent skimmings, 
add a full quart of tomatoes and the corn cut from two large ears, also 



30 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

the cobs, and boil gently for another hour. Then remove the corncobs 
and what is left of the beef, and the chicken bones, leaving the chicken 
meat in the stew; season with salt, cayenne pepper, a teaspoonful of 
Worcestershire sauce and a teaspoonful of sugar, and it is ready to serve. 
Dry boiled rice is nice served with this gumbo, which is a stew rather 
than a soup. Many recipes for gumbo call for a small quantity of "fillet 
powder" ; this is the tender young green leaves of sassafras powdered. 

Ham, Curing. — This is a Virginia method. For curing four hams, 
averaging 12 pounds each, have ready one and a half gallons of the best 
salt, one pound of good brown sugar, one-eighth pound of powdered 
saltpeter, one ounce of black pepper and one-half ounce of cayenne. Cut 
the joints into proper shapes, without unnecessary bone and fat, and lay 
them on a board on table. First rub the skin well with salt and lay 
each joint aside, then begin over again, and into the fleshy side of each 
ham rub two teaspoonfuls of saltpeter and a tablespoonful of brown 
sugar mixed together. Rub the pepper, particularly, about the hock and 
under the bone and give to the whole ham a good application of salt. 
Now pack the hams, one upon another, the skin side downward, with a 
layer of salt between, into a tub or box, the bottom of which has also 
been covered with salt. The process of salting will be complete in five 
weeks. At the end of that time have ready about a peck of hickory 
ashes ; clean the hams with a brush or dry cloth and rub them with the 
ashes. To smoke the hams the joints should be hung from joists beneath 
the ceiling and a slow, smothered fire kept up for five or six weeks, so 
as to smoke thoroughly, but not overheat the hams. Or, as an excellent 
substitute for this process, paint the hams with a coating of pyroligneous 
acid, let them dry and repeat the operation. Wrap each ham in paper 
and encase it in a canvas or strong cotton bag. 

A simple way to salt bacon and hams in brine is to rub the meat well 
with salt, especially into the exposed ends of bones, and then pack into 
a barrel, with a layer of salt between each piece. Allow the meat to 
remain thus for 48 hours, then pour over all a brine strong enough to 
bear up an tgg. Let the meat remain in pickle six weeks ; then smoke. 

Molasses pickle is made as follows : To four quarts of fine salt and 
two ounces of pulverized saltpeter add enough molasses to make a paste. 
Hang the hams in a cool dry place for three or four days after cutting 
up; then cover with the pickle mixture, thickest on the flesh side, and lay 
them skin down for three or four days. For 100 pounds of ham make 
brine in the following proportion: Seven pounds coarse salt; two ounces 
saltpeter; one-half ounce pearlash; four gallons soft water. Heat grad- 
ually, removing all scum as it arises, then cool. Pack the hams in a 
barrel, pour the brine over them, and keep in pickle five to eight weeks, 
according to size. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 31 

Ham, Sugar Cured. — To 50 pounds of ham or "side bacon" allow three 
pounds of sugar and a pint of molasses, six pounds of salt, one fuld 
tablespoonful of saleratus and the same of saltpeter. Cover the bottom 
of your firkin with salt (about two pounds). Mix sugar, molasses, salt- 
peter, saleratus and the remaining salt into a paste. Rub each piece 
thoroughly with this, work it in well and hard, and pack into the firkin, 
the rind downward. Cover all with cold water — just enough to rise above 
the meat. Lay a heavy board on top, weight it with a stone to keep the 
meat under water, and leave it thus for four weeks, turning the meat and 
stirring up the pickle every week. Take out, then wipe, rub into the 
pieces as much dry salt and an equal quantity of sugar as they will take 
up; pack in a dry firkin and leave for 24 hours before sending to the 
smokehouse. 

Hamburg Steak, Baked. — One and one-half pound raw chopped beef, 
two cupfuls of stale bread softened with half a cupful of hot milk and 
cooled, two eggs, small onion minced, teaspoonful of salt, saltspoonful 
of pepper and pinch of ginger. Mix well and shape into a square; place 
m baking pan with a tablespoonful of tomato, small onion and butter 
the size of a walnut on top of meat. Bake one hour, basting frequently. 
The potatoes should be boiled 15 minutes, then drained, pared and placed 
in pan with the Hamburg steak to cook 45 minutes, being turned and 
basted often. Medium-sized potatoes are best for this. Serve arranged 
around the meat. 

Hungarian Hamburg Steak. — Beat an egg into a bowl, stir in bread 
crumbs (about a cupful), a small onion, grated, salt and paprika (a mild- 
flavored cayenne pepper). The meat is stirred into this, and after thor- 
ough mixing is formed into a ball. An onion is fried brown in butter, 
put into an earthen saucepan with a tight-fitting cover, and the meat ball 
is added, with two tomatoes cut into quarters around it. After simmering 
for half an hour the meat is turned gently, so as not to break the ball, 
then allowed to cook quietly for nearly an hour, and served with the 
vegetables as a garnish. 

Senator Hanna's Hash. — This is the recipe given by the Boston Cook- 
ing School. Take equal portions of tender boiled corned beef and mealy 
boiled potatoes. Cut the potatoes into small cubes and the meat as fine 
as possible. Mix thoroughly with these a small onion, chopped very fine ; 
a slice of onion is often sufficient. Butter a hot frying pan and turn into 
it chopped materials. Press into the center of the mass a clove of garlic, 
wrapped in a piece of salt pork or mild cured bacon. Set over a moderate 
fire, cover and let cook, adding a small quantity of water, if moist hash 
is preferred; when heated, stir, remove the garlic and give the whole 
round shape. Let stand in the oven until browned underneath, then 
carefully slide on a serving dish. While the hash is cooking cut one or 



32 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

two Bermuda onions into thin slices and fry until crisp in deep fat. Use 
these as a garnish for the hash (or omit if preferred). Serve with lemon 
quarters. 

Hot-Pot. — Two pounds of cross-rib is cut in small pieces and put in 
an earthen saucepan, with two minced onions, five or six small green pep- 
pers, whole, a few chives, a handful of seeded raisins, a cupful of to- 
matoes, peeled and sliced, eight or 10 olives, a bit of thyme, a big table - 
spoonful of drippings, salt to taste, and a cupful of vinegar and water. 
The pot is covered tightly, and the mixture simmered slowly until the 
meat is cooked to pieces ; then a tablespoonful of butter well coated with 
flour is stirred in to thicken the gravy. 

Liver and Bacon in Casserole. — Slice liver about half an inch thick, 
and put in a buttered saucepan, peppering lightly. Over the liver lay a 
dozen thin slices of bacon, and strew these with chopped onion and par- 
sley. Cover closely and cook slowly for about two hours. The cooking 
must not be hurried. When ready to serve the liver, let the gravy, with 
the bacon in it, boil hard for two minutes, then pour it over the the 
liver in the serving dish. 

Liver, Fried in New Orleans Style. — Cut a pound of calf's liver in half- 
inch cubes. After washing and draining, place in a bowl which has been 
rubbed with an onion. Between two layers of liver place a layer of 
chopped onion and parsley, sprinkling with salt and dusting lightly with 
cayenne. After half an hour take out the liver and shake off all the 
onion. Roll lightly in flour and drop into a deep kettle of boiling fat. 
Drain on paper and serve very hot with lemon. The liver cooks to de- 
licious tenderness and delicacy of flavor. 

Calves' Liver, English Style. — Two pounds of fresh liver, one-half 
pound fat salt pork, one spoonful of butter, half an onion, one spoonful 
chopped parsley and pepper. Put the butter in a warm, not hot, sauce- 
pan, cut the liver into slices half an inch thick and lay upon the butter; 
mince the pork and cover the liver; sprinkle the parsley and onion with 
pepper on top; cover the saucepan closely and set it into a kettle of hot 
water; keep this water below the boiling point for an hour, then let it 
boil another hour; the liver will by this time be very tender and juicy 
if the heat has been properly adjusted. Take it out and place it in a 
dish to keep warm. Thicken the gravy with brown butter and pour over 
the liver and serve. 

English Meat Pie.— Chop cold beef finely, put in a deep baking dish 
a layer of the meat, strew lightly with bread crumbs, season highly with 
salt, pepper, butter and a few drops of onion juice; repeat the process 
till the dish is full or your meat used up. Pour over it a cup of stock 
or gravy, or, lacking these, hot water with a teaspoonful of butter melted 
in it; on top a good layer of bread crumbs should be put and seasoned 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. S3 

and dotted with butter. Cover and bake half an hour; remove the cover 
and brown. 

Mock Duck. — Four pork tenderloins; slash lengthwise, rub with salt 
and pepper, fill with dressing made of bread crumbs, one onion, one egg, 
one-half cupful butter, salt and pepper to taste; tie together and bake in 
roaster. Serve with hot apple sauce made as follows: Pare and quarter 
(if large, cut in eighths) as many apples as the family appetite requires. 
Fut a layer of apples in a granite or enameled shallow pan, put bits of 
butter, goodly supply sugar and dash of cinnamon on the apples. Do this 
in layers till pan is full; add a little water and bake till rich and clear, 
not just barely done. 

Mutton Mince With Eggs. — Scrape every morsel of meat from the 
bone, crack the latter, cover with cold water and let it simmer at the 
hack of the stove for four or five hours. Strain off the cupful of liquid 
and thicken with a lump of butter rolled in browned flour; season with 
salt, pepper and tomato catsup; stir into it the cold mutton cut small 
and a handful of bread crumbs, strewing some of these on top; bake 
until the surface bubbles, drop four or five eggs upon the top, pepper 
and salt them, set back in the oven and leave there until the eggs are 
"set." 

Mutton Pie. — A mutton pie made from the neck of mutton is as 
savory as it is economical. Cut off the spine bone and the scrag end, 
shorten the ribs to about three inches, but save all these trimmings to 
make the gravy for the pie. Cut the mutton into neat chops, pare off 
the fat, season with salt and pepper and place in the deep pie dish in a 
circle, one lapping over the other. Fill the center with tiny potato balls 
cut out with the cutter; add the mutton gravy which has been boiled to 
make the quantity required, sprinkle with salt and pepper, cover with good 
pie crust brushed over with the yolk of an tgg and bake for an hour 
and a half in a moderate oven. 

Ragout of Mutton. — Use two pounds of mutton from the shoulder or 
breast. Cut in small pieces, about two inches square. Cut up some of 
the mutton fat which has not touched the skin and fry slowly in a pan 
until there is about a gill of liquid fat; take out the solid pieces and put 
in the mutton and stir until it becomes brown. Take the meat from the 
fat, being careful to press out all the fat. To the fat add one pint of 
turnip cubes and two tablespoonfuls of onion cut fine; cook slowly for 
10 minutes, then take them oqt and put in the stew pan with the meat. 
Pour the fat from the frying pan and put in two tablespoonfuls of butter 
and the same amount of flour; stir until brown, when add one quart of 
boiling water. When this thickens add it to the meat and vegetables with 
a rounding teaspoonful of salt and one-third of a teaspoonful of pepper. 
Simmer for three hours, covered. 



34 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

"Pawnhas."— This old-fashioned dish is similar to scrapple. Boil to- 
gether the "jowls," liver and heart of a hog until very tender. Take out 
all bones, chop the heart and meat from jowls until very fine;; crumble 
the liver as finely as possible and put all back into the kettle. Now 
season with pepper and salt, and be sure to add enough v/ater to keeip 
it from being too rich or greasy. Stir in white cornmeal until you have 
a thin mush, let cook slowly half an hour, pour into a large crock or 
jar; set away to cool. When cold, slice like mush and put into a skillet 
to fry. Add no grease. This is delicious and will keep indefinitely in 
a cool place. 

Pigeons, Potted. — Place six cleaned birds in a deep kettle with one 
pint of vinegar and three onions, halved; let stand over night, then throw 
the vinegar and onions away. Brown six slices of pork and two onions, 
sliced; place in the kettle with the pigeons; add one pint of hot water, 
salt and pepper; cover and simmer about two hours; serve the pigeons 
on a hot dish about a mound of parsley; strain the liquor, thicken, and 
pass in a gravy boat. 

Pigs' Feet in Jelly. — Thoroughly scrape and clean one dozen pigs' feet. 
Place them in a kettle, cover with boiling water, add one tablespoonful 
of salt and simmer steadily until tender. Transfer the feet to a stone 
crock, placing between them thin slices of Qnion. Heat and boil to- 
gether for five minutes two quarts of good vinegar, one bay leaf, two 
tablespoonfuls of sugar, one dozen whole cloves, six tiny red peppers, and 
one-half teaspoonful of salt. Add one quart of boiling water and pour 
at once over the pigs' feet. Cover and let stand two days before using. 

Pilgrim Pie. — Cut a two-pound piece of fresh pork into dice, after it 
is cooked, and prepare the following crust : One pint mashed potatoes, 
owe-half teaspoonful salt, one tablespoonful butter, one-fourth teaspoon- 
ful pepper, one-fourth cup of milk, one level teaspoonful baking powder, 
and enough flour to make a crust which can be easily rolled out one 
inch thick. Put alternate layers, in a baking dish, of the diced pork, 
raw oysters, minced parsley, a light dusting of Summer savory, finely 
shredded onion, with salt and pepper to suit, and one tablespoonful but- 
ter; cover with a brown sauce; fit a cover of the potato biscuit and bake 
in hot oven 20 minutes. Five minutes before it is finished draw out, cover 
with fine cracker crumbs mixed with one tgg; return to the oven to 
finish browning; garnish with parsley. This potato crust is excellent for 
any meat pie. 

Pork With Corn Dumplings.^Cook ai piece of shoulder of pork in a 
big pot until tender ; then mix the desired quantity of cornmeal to a 
thick dough as in making bread (the addition of an tgg to the dough im- 
proves the dumplings). Drop balls of the dough about the size of a 
walnut in the boiling water about the meat in the pot and cook 20 min- 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 35 

utes, when the dumplings will be done, and will have a thick gravy 
around them. Take care not to let the mixture burn. The fat and 
juices of the meat season the dumplings excellently. 

Rabbit, Jugged. — Select a plump tender rabbit. Wash, wipe dry, and 
cut into well-shaped pieces. Have ready a teaspoonful of salt and one- 
fourth teaspoonful of pepper and rub this into the rabbit pieces. Put 
four tablespoonfuls of flour on a plate and roll each piece in this. Heat 
half a cupful of butter in frying pan; when hot fry the rabbit, browning 
on both sides, being careful not to burn the butter. As soon as it 
browns put the rabbit into a stewpan and into the hot butter stir what is 
left of the flour in which the rabbit was rolled; add three teacupfuls hot 
water and cook 10 minutes. Pour this over the rabbit, adding two 
cloves, one-half bayleaf, two or three allspice, one teaspoonful salt, one- 
fourth teaspoonful pepper, a slice or two of onion. Cover closely and 
simmer for an hour and a half. Add one teaspoonful lemon juice and 
one tablespoonful good catsup. Remove the rabbit to a hot platter; 
strain what liquid is left, add to it a teaspoonful each of butter and flour 
rubbed smooth and a cupful of hot water; boil up once, pour over the 
rabbit and serve. 

Rabbit, Breaded. — Dress the rabbit, then let it soak over night in cold 
salt water. Cut into neat pieces, and boil gently until tender in clear 
water to which an onion has been added. Let it cool and drain; then 
dip in well-beaten tg^, roll in cracker crumbs and fry In hot butter. 
Serve with cranberry sauce. Barbecued rabbit, a favorite southern dish, 
may also be recommended: Lay the rabbit in salt and water 30 minutes, 
then scald with boiling water and wipe dry, rub well with butter, and 
sprinkle with pepper and salt. Broil until quite brown, and lay on a 
hot dish ; butter plentifully on both sides. Prepare a sauce of four tea- 
spoonfuls of vinegar, one teaspoonful of made mustard, one of currant 
jelly and one of walnut catsup. Pour this hot over the rabbit. 

Ragout with Dumplings.— Get a piece of nice, fresh round steak, 
about one and one-half pound (cut thick). Cut it into pieces about an 
inch square, smother it with flour, well seasoned with salt and red pep- 
per. Brown in the frying pan one large onion or two small ones, with 
about one large tablespoonful of butter; then add the steak and brown. 
Put the whole into a granite saucepan, pour over it five pints of boiling 
water and simmer two hours. About 20 minutes before serving make 
dumplings as follows: A cup of flour sifted with a little salt and a half 
teaspoonful of baking powder, and rub in a teaspoonful of butter. Mix 
very soft with milk— so soft that it is slightly sticky; drop by small 
spoonfuls into the stew and cover tightly until served. 

Sausage.— This is a Virginia recipe. To every 10 pounds of meat 
use three ounces of salt, one of black pepper, one-half ounce of sage 



36 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

rubbed fine. Having all ingredients weighed, put a layer of the meat 
cut in strips, sprinkle the mixed seasoning over it, another layer of meat 
with more seasoning, distributing as evenly as possible. Run twice 
throungh the grinder, and when it is put on the table it is surprising 
to see how quickly it vanishes. Ordinary pork sausage, smoked in bags, 
makes a desirable change, and keeps well. Pack the sausage meat in 
small bags of coarse, strong muslin, the size selected being that most 
convenient for slicing; small salt sacks, well washed, may answer. Close 
the bags, and then smoke, just like ham, the amount of smoking depend- 
mg on the family taste. When used, split down the seam of the bag 
for convenience in cutting the slices, and fry like ham. 

Sausage, Bologna. — Six pounds of lean beef; one pound salt pork; 
three pounds lean fresh pork; one pound beef suet; one ounce white pep- 
per; one teaspoonful ground mace; three ounces salt; one teaspoonful 
cayenne; one large onion chopped fine. Chop the meat and suet sep- 
arately very fine, then mix; add all the seasoning, and m.ix thoroughly. 
Fill into casings and tie into lengths, or use strong linen bags. Make a 
brine that will bear an egg; put the sausage into it, and let stand two 
v/eeks, turning and skimming every day. At the end of the first week 
throw away the old brine, and put the sausage into new for the second 
week; then smoke for a week. When smoked rub over the outside with 
olive oil, and store in a cool, dark dry place. If you wish to keep the 
sausage for any length of time sprinkle the outside with pepper. 

Sausage, Frankfurter. — Chop up pork, lean meat and fat (ham can 
be used) in the proportion of four pounds lean to one of fat. To a 
pound of the mixture season with salt, 11 grams, one-half gram salt- 
petre, two grams white pepper and one-half gram cloves. Mix the whole 
so intimately that "you cannot tell the fat pieces from the lean." The 
more thorough the mixing the better the result. If the mixing is not 
free, you can add a little water, but do not overdo this. If too "waxy" 
from excess of fat, add lean; or, the other way, if too meaty. Use pig's 
cases for the filling. Tie the sausage in length desired. Hang the links 
well apart in the smokehouse. Tolerable heat will do them rightly 
enough, but if you want the deep rich tint of brown, you will have to 
finish them off over a brick fire. It is hard to fix the temperature, 
as the smokehouse in the open will be cooler than the one indoors. Test 
the state by running a quill in and examining the extract by the taste, 
sight and smell. Sometimes they are put in bundles of 10 or 12 folded 
together and pressed to flatten. Keep in a box under weight before put- 
ting in the smoke. 

Sausage, Holland Home. — Grind, mix and season the meat as de- 
sired. Instead of stuffing "cases," pack in half-gallon stone jars (but- 
ter jars). Bake four hours in a moderately hot oven. Remove from 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 37 

the oven and press with a heavy weight 12 hours — over night usually. 
Then remove the weight. There will be some fat, but not enough to 
cover it. Heat lard to the boiling point and pour over enough to cover. 
This seals— excludes the air. Keep in a cool place. Beef or pork may be 
kept in this way indefinitely. 

Oxford Sausage.— One pound each of finely chopped veal, pork and 
beef suet. Mix through this one quart of bread crumbs, grated peel of 
half a lemon, a grated nutmeg, a sprig each of savory, thyme and sweet 
marjoram and a tablespoonful of powdered sage leaves. Make in cakes 
and fry in very little hot butter. 

Sausage, Pork and Beef. — For 10 pounds of sausage use seven and 
one-half pounds of pork and two and a half of beef; grind fine, add two 
tablespoonfuls of salt, one teaspoonful each of pepper, allspice, cloves and 
sage. Heat all together until so hot you cannot hold your finger in it. 
Turn into stone jars that have been thoroughly scalded and aired, cover 
with cheesecloth and pour hot suet over the cloth. When any is wanted 
for use, take out and make into cakes and fry. 

Summer Sausage. — ^Use any recipe you like best, but use cloth casings 
made from muslin, casings to have a diameter of three to four inches, 
and length to fit a baking pan. Casings are easily made with sewing 
machine. Smoke the finished sausage to your heart's content. After 
smoking let sausage dry sufficiently, which takes four or five weeks, de- 
pending on where hung to dry. The sausage should be fit for eating, 
which can readily be ascertained by cutting one through. When dry 
enough melt a quantity of paraffin — about one-half pound for a dozen 
sausages — put in baking pan, then place the sausages therein and roll 
about in the hot paraffin, one at a time. Hang up in a dry place and 
they will keep nicely and indefinitely. 

Virginia Beef Sausage. — Mix two cupfuls of finely-chopped raw beef, 
lJ/2 cupful of fat salt pork minced very fine, two teaspoonfuls of pow- 
dered sage, a scant teaspoonful of pepper — the pork should furnish suffi- 
cient salt — and one tablespoonful of lemon juice. When thoroughly 
mixed pack it in small round tin cans and set away to become hard. 
When wanted for breakfast slice three-fourths of an inch thick and 
either brown in the oven or fry in a hot, well-greased pan. 

Scrapple, Philadelphia. — Take a cleaned pig's head and boil until the 
flesh strips easily from the bones. Remove all the bones and chop fine. 
Set the liquor in which the meat was boiled aside until cold, take the 
cake of fat from the surface and return the liquor to the fire. When it 
boils, put in the chopped meat and season well with pepper and salt. Let 
it boil again and thicken with cornmeal as you would in making ordinary 
cornmeal mush, by letting it slip slowly through the fingers to prevent 
lumps. Cook an hour, stirring constantly at first, afterward putting back 



38 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

on the range in a position to boil gently. When done, pour into a long, 
square pan, not too deep, and mold. In cold weather this can be kept 
several weeks. Slice and fry brown in butter or dripping. 

Souse. — Clean pig's ears and feet well; cover them with cold water 
slightly salted and boil until tender. Pack in stone jars while hot, and 
cover while you make ready for pickle. To half a gallon of good cider 
vinegar allow half a cup of white sugar, three dozen whole black pep- 
pers, a dozen blades of mace and a dozen cloves. Boil this one minute, 
taking care that it really boils, and pour while hot over the still warm 
feet and ears. It will be ready to use in two days and will keep in a cool 
place for two months. If you wish it for breakfast, make a batter of 
one tggy one cup of milk, salt to taste, and a teaspoonful of butter, with 
enough flour for a thin muffin batter; dip each piece in this and fry in 
hot lard or dripping. Or dip each in beaten ^gg, then in pounded 
cracker before frying. Souse is also good eaten cold, especially the feet. 

Stew, Oven. — Two or three pounds of beef shin are selected, the bone 
being broken into three or four pieces. After wiping with a damp cloth, 
remove all the meat from the bone and cut into small pieces for serving. 
Scrape the marrow from the bone and place in a kettle, and in it brown 
first the meat, then the vegetables cut in cubes — half an onion and one 
carrot. Now dredge well with flour and salt, adding about a tablespoon- 
ful of browned flour to give color. Add one or two whole cloves, one- 
half cup of tomato or a little tomato catsup, then the pieces of bone. 
Cook in the oven in a deep iron meat-pan for three or four hours, adding 
potatoes, cut in cubes, one hour before serving. 

Stew, Tomato. — Fry a tiny onion, or a slice or two of ordinary size, 
in a couple of tablespoonfuls of fat. Add two or three slices of carrot 
and let them brown. Then stir in a cupful of canned tomatoes and half a 
cupful of beef stock or gravy. If stock is used the mixture should be 
thickened with a little flour. Add also half a bayleaf and a couple of 
sprays of Summer savory, and simmer the stew slowly for half an hour, 
so that it may be permeated with the seasonings. At the end of this time 
add the cold meat from a shank of beef, or any "leftover," cut in small 
pieces. Simmer very slowly for five or 10 minutes and serve hot, after 
dashing in a little salt and pepper. 

Tough Meat. — To soften a tough steak pour a few spoonfuls of vine- 
gar, or vinegar and oil mixed, over it, and allow it to stand 12 to 24 
hours,- turning occasionally. A tough piece of meat may be laid in vine- 
gar (not too strong) for three or four days in Summer, or twice as long in 
Winter. Oil or spices may be added to the vinegar if desired, this bath 
being termed a marinade. Tough meat should receive long gentle cook- 
ing, preferably in an enclosed vessel which will prevent evaporation of 
juices. Such beef should not be treated like a tender rib roast; it would 



THE RURAL COOK BOOR. 39 

better be braised (pot roast) or cooked as beef a la mode. The mar- 
inade will be found desirable when the meat is cooked in this way. If 
stewed, the same system of prolonged gentle cooking (preferably in an 
earthen stewpan or casserole) should be employed. 

Stuffed Tenderloin. — Procure a good-sized tenderloin, slit one side 
open and lay within a dressing made as follows: One cupful of dry grated 
crumbs, one tablespoonful of minced parseley, one large teaspoonful of 
mixed sweet herbs, thyme, Summer savory, sweet marjoram and sage, 
one heaping teaspoonful of finely chopped onion fried in one tablespoon- 
ful of butter, one- half teaspoonful salt, one saltspoonful pepper. If this 
amount of butter does not make it moist enough add a trifle more melted 
butter, but no water. Stuff the tenderloin and sew up the opening. If 
it is not fat place two or three slices of bacon over the top, fastening 
with wooden toothpicks. Rub into the meat one teaspoonful of salt, one- 
fourth teaspoonful of white pepper. Dust with flour and roast. When 
done remove the tenderloin to a heated platter and put the roasting pan 
on top of stove, adding one tablespoonful of flour to the gravy which it 
contains. When thoroughly browned add a cupful of hot water, two 
tablespoonfuls of chopped gherkins, and one tablespoonful of finely- 
chopped olives. 

Veal and Ham Pie. — A pound of veal cutlet cut in small pieces is 
rolled in flour and browned in hot bacon fat. Cover with boiling water, 
or, if possible, with stock made from the trimmings of veal and seasoned 
with sweet herbs, carrot and onion, and simmer for about two hours 
Put the pieces of veal in a baking dish. Have ready half a cupful of 
finely chopped cooked ham. Add to it a little of the liquid in which the 
veal was cooked, and pound smooth in a mortar. Then press through a 
puree sieve, and add the rest of the liquid with such seasoning as may 
be desired. Pour this over the meat in the dish, adding half a pint of 
oysters and a few bits of butter. Cover the dish with a pastry or rich 
biscuit crust, and bake about 25 minutes. 

Veal, Paprika Schnitzel. — Cut two pounds of thick veal steak into 
small pieces, roll in seasoned flour, fry brown in salt pork fat. Remove 
the meat from the pan, add two tablespoonfuls of flour to the remaining 
fat, brown lightly and pour in the strained liquid from a pint can of to- 
matoes, or if desired slice in a pint of fresh peeled tomatoes. Add a 
slice each of onion and carrot, three bay leaves and a bit of mace, then 
return the meat to the sauce, cover closely and simmer for three-quarters 
of an hour. When done remove the meat, add a little more salt if neces- 
sary (the pork helps to season) a pinch of paprika or red pepper, and 
strain on to the platter. 



CHAPTER IV. 

PASTRY AKD PIES. 

When pieplant gives tlie first good mess, 

With nice hot biscuit, I confess 
Our follis feel good. Pop says : "I guess 

You ought to have a bran' new dress." 
"And you a coat," I sez, "no less !" 

I know our folks will always bless 
The day that pieplant gives first mess. 

Some of our friends, who have spent many years abroad, tell of a 
Roman pension or boarding-house whose proprietor boasted that he had 
recipes for more than 365 delicious desserts. During the months our 
friends were at the pension they never had the same dessert twice, which, 
they complained, was really pathetic, for man}- of the dishes were so 
delicious that they longed for a repetition. We doubt whether anyone 
could duplicate that experience in an American boarding-house, where, 
too often, pie is almost the only form of dessert, except a restricted range 
of puddings. The unwholesome effect of pastry often results, we believe, 
from eating it as the finish to a hearty meal, when the digestion is already 
fully tasked. We are told by those who use it that the oil pie crust, 
recipe for which is given, is more easily digested than that made with 
other shortening. 

Pie Crust. — For one pie use one cupful sifted flour, one-half cup of 
shortening, pinch of salt. It will be much flakier if chopped together 
with a knife, instead of rubbing in the hands. Stir in enough cold water 
to mix it so it may be rolled out. Handle as little as possible, and keep 
very cold. It is improved by making a day before using, and storing in 
the icebox or other cold place. 

Cream Pie Crust. — If one can use cream, delicious crust may be made. 
Add baking powder and salt to the flour and mix stiff with cream that is 
not too heavy. The crust is tender, browns quickly and has a very sweet, 
agreeable flavor. 

Oil Pie Crust. — For this either olive or refined cotton-seed oil may 
be used. For one pie take one cup flour, add pinch of salt, mix and add 
two tablespoonfuls oil; rub well together and add three tablespoonfuls 
cold water. Handle dough as little as possible and roll thin. 

Puff Paste. — Use equal weights of flour and butter; by measure, one 
pint of flour and one cup of butter. Wash the butter in cold water 
until all the salt is out; the hands should first be washed in hot, then 
cold water, to prevent the butter from sticking. When washed until 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 41 

smooth and waxy divide butter into four parts, pat until thin, wrap in 
a napkin and place upon ice. Mix a little salt with the flour, mix in 
about one-balf cup of ice water, stirring it in with a knife, and cut 
until it can be taken up clean from the bowl. Put on a well-floured 
board, roll until one-half inch thick. Roll one portion of the butter thin, 
fold it up inside the paste, pat and roll out again. Repeat this process 
with the rest of the butter. When putting in the butter, fold the sides 
of the paste over it toward the middle, then the ends over, and double; 
then roll. This process should continue until no streaks of fat are shown. 
Whenever the butter becomes soft, it should be chilled, and when finished 
the paste should be wrapped in a napkin, and kept in the refrigerator. 
This is the paste used for patty cases, and similar delicate pastry. It 
requires a "knack'' as well as a recipe to get good results. 

Crust for Raised Pies. — This is the crust used by English house- 
keepers for pork and other meat pies, in which the crust is patted and 
shaped into a deep dish shape, which is filled with meat and then covered 
with a top crust. The crust is hard and stiff when cold, but softens 
when warm. Put one cupful of water in a saucepan, add one pound of 
lard, put on stove to melt, and allow it to come to boiling point, stirring 
well; sift about three pounds of flour into a bowl, make a hole in the 
middle, and stir in the hot liquid, mixing with a spoon until it is cool 
enough to knead with the hands. It may require the addition of more 
flour, as it should be very stiff. To make a pork pie, this crust should 
be molded with the hands into a dish shape four or five inches deep; 
an oval four or five by six inches is a convenient size. Good, tender, 
fresh roasting pork is cut into half-inch pieces, and well seasoned; the 
pie is filled and covered, after a small amount of water is sprinkled over, 
and then the pie is baked for about ly^ hour, in a steady oven. It is 
always served cold. Game birds or pigeons make excellent raised pie 
also. To give a shining yellow appearance to the pastry, brush it over 
with the yolk of an egg, beaten up with two tablespoonfuls of milk, 
about 10 minutes before it is taken out of the oven. 

Almond Bars. — Roll puff paste into thin narrow strips. Beat one 
egg white slightly and mix it with two tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar 
and one cupful of finely-chopped almonds. Spread this mixture over the 
strips of paste and brown them in the oven. Sometimes the almonds ar« 
rolled into the paste. Mix two tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar with 
the same amount of chopped almonds and sprinkle over the paste when 
first rolled out. Fold and roll again, then repeat the process. Finally cut 
into long sticks, brush with white of an egg and brown in the oven. One 
teaspoonful of cinnamon may be used in place of the almonds, when th« 
result will be cinnamon bars.

Apple Pie. — This is how a Michigan housekeeper makes it: The under 
crust was first brushed over lightly with white of an tgg and allowed to 
stand while the rest of the work went on; this to keep the juices from 
soaking into the crust before baking. Next a half -cupful of sugar was 
put in, along with a half to a tablespoonful of flour, according to the 
degree of juiciness of the apples, and a generous pinch of cinnamon or 
allspice according to choice. These were rubbed smoothly together to 
insure a jelly-like consistency of the finished pie, without the unpalatable 
doughy lumps. The fruit is then added, the remainder of the sugar 
poured over (a cupful in all for very sour apples), the top dotted thickly 
with butter, and unless the apples are very juicy a dessertspoonful of 
water added. The edge of the under crust is now moistened with water, 
the top applied and the two pinched neatly together; the whole brushed 
over with rich milk to insure an even golden-brownness, and a tiny funnel 
made of writing paper twisted and pinned into shape inserted in the air 
hole cut in the top. These details observed you may now put your pie 
into the oven with a certainty that it will come out a thing of beauty, 
with none of its savory juices burning to a crisp in the bottom of 
the oven. For very young apples, however, she always used instead of 
the water, a generous tablespoonful of spiced vinegar (left over from 
any spiced sweet pickle) with a little more flour. Or if apples had been 
kept some time and were shriveled and insipid, she found the same treat- 
ment a vast improvement. Lacking the spiced vinegar she sometimes used 
lemon juice with an additional sprinkling of sugar and spices. Other fruit 
pies were made in a similar manner, always taking into consideration the 
qualities of the fruit as to acidity and juiciness. For canned fruits 
already sweetened, such as huckleberries, elderberries and the like, which 
were very juicy and required no extra sweetening, she usually rubbed the 
flour (in same proportion of a spoonful to a pie) in a bit of the juice, 
and added it with whatever spices were necessary to the rest of the fruit, 
and set it over the fire until the flour was cooked, adding a little butter. 
When cold the mixture was filled into the prepared paste, egg-brushed 
as before. For custard or pumpkin she usually prepared the paste by 
setting the pan on top of the stove until the crust was nearly cooked 
through, then adding the custard and putting it at once into a hot oven. 
When sweet cider is at hand, it may be used to give additional flavor to 
an apple pie. Warm half a cupful of cider and, 10 minutes before the 
pie is taken from the oven, pour the cider into it through the hole in the 
center of top crust, using a little funnel of stiff paper to prevent splashing. 

Appleless Apple Pie. — Soak two large soda crackers in a large cup of 
boiling water. Add small piece butter. When cool add two tablespoon- 
fuls vinegar, one cup sugar, a few raisins and a little nutmeg. Bake with 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 43 

two crusts as you do the real apple pie. Another appleless apple pie is 
made from pumpkins as follows: Procure a good sound pumpkin (or 
squash), wash, cut a round of same, as deep as an ordinary apple is, from 
stem to blossom end; peel, cut down crosswise in slices about an eighth 
of an inch thick; put in water enough to cover, and stew slowly until 
tender, but not mushy. Lift carefully from the water, let cool. Prepare 
crust as for apple pie, line your tins with the crust, place your slices of 
pumpkin just as you would slices of apple; sprinkle over them a little 
flour — not over a tablespoonful of sugar; add one tablespoonful of pure 
cider vinegar to each pie, a few lumps of butter, finish with a top crust. 
Bake to a rich brown color in a moderate oven. 

Vermont Blackberry Pie. — Line a deep dripping pan with pastry, cover 
the bottom with a generous layer of blackberries, sprinkle with sugar and 
cover with a crust. Bake, then add another layer of blackberries and 
sugar, cover with a top crust, and then bake again. This is recommended 
as highly delicious, either hot or cold. 

Buttermilk Pie.— Beat together a heaping cupful of sugar and four 
eggs; add half a cupful of butter; beat thoroughly and add 1^ pint of 
fresh buttermilk; line pie tins with crust; slice an apple thin and lay 
in each pie; fill crust with the mixture and bake with one crust. 

Butterscotch Pie. — Two eggs, one cup brown sugar, butter size of 
walnut, tablespoon of flour, one cup cream, one teaspoon vanilla. Cream 
the butter, sugar and flour together, add the beaten yolks, cream and 
flavoring. Pour this into a good baked pie crust and return to the oven. 
When it has thickened spread over it the whites beaten very stiffs, with 
two level tablespoons of sugar. Have the oven quite cool while the 
meringue is browning. 

Carrot Pie. — Scrape the skin off the carrots, boil them soft and strain 
them through a sieve. To a pint of the strained pulp put three pints of 
milk, six beaten eggs, two tablespoonfuls of melted butter, the juice of 
half a lemon and the grated rind of a whole one. Sweeten it to your 
taste, and bake it in deep pie plates without an upper crust. 

Cheese Cakes. — This is a rich English dainty. Take four ounces of 
butter, and cream it in a warm pan; add four ounces of sugar, beat well; 
add the yolk of one e^g, beat again, then add one whole tgg; beat all 
well together, and mix in four ounces of currants. Line patty pans 
with paste, fill with the mixture, shake a little sugar over the top, and bake. 

Curd Cheese Cakes. — Add one tgg to one cupful of fresh curd; beat 
smooth, and beat in one-half cupful of sugar, and a piece of butter the 
size of a walnut. Flavor with nutmeg or any other spice, and use as 
filling for a pie without top crust. A richer curd cheese cake is made 
by using the recipe given for ordinary cheese cakes, and beating the curd 
into it before the currants are added. 



44 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Chocolate Pie. — Line a deep pie pan with rich pie crust and bake in a 
quick oven. Grate one-half teacupful of chocolate and put into a sauce- 
pan, with one cupful of hot water, butter the size of an tgg, one table- 
spoonful vanilla, one cupful of sugar, the beaten yolk of two eggs and 
two tablespoonfuls of cornstarch, dissolved in a little water ; mix well ; 
cook until thick, stirring constantly. Pour into the pie shell and let cool. 
Beat the whites of the two eggs to a stiff froth, add two tablespoonfuls 
of powdered sugar, spread on top of pie and slightly brown in oven. 

Cider Jelly Pie. — This is a tested old-fashioned recipe. A half pint of 
boiled cider, a cupful of brown sugar, a cupful of boiling water and two 
tablespoonfuls of cornstarch. Stir the cornstarch into the cider, add the 
other ingredients and cook for 10 minutes. Fill into a pastry-lined pie 
tin and cover with an upper crust. 

Cream Pie. — Mix thoroughly two cups of flour and five tablespoonfuls 
of butter, then add three tablespoonfuls of sugar and one large tgg, which 
has been thoroughly beaten together previously. Roll an eighth of an inch 
thick, line two pie tins, prick with a folk and bake a pale brown, then 
fill with this cream: Two cups milk, two tablespoonfuls of cornstarch, 
five tablespoonfuls of sugar, yolks of five eggs. Cook together like cus- 
tard, and when cold cover with meringue made of whites of five eggs and 
five tablespoons powdered sugar. 

New England Cream Tart Pie. — Select firm Esopus apples and make 
as dry an apple sauce as possible, sweetened slightly and strained. For 
a large-sized pie use one pint of apple, one pint of thick cream, yolks of 
two eggs beaten stiff, and one-half of a nutmeg. An under crust only 
is used, and this may be baked the day before. Fill and bake about one- 
half hour. Use the whites of two eggs for the meringue and brown in 
the oven. Greenings are good for this pie when Esopus is not at hand, 
but apples of low quality should not be used for it. 

Crumb Pie. — Soak a pint of bread crumbs in milk. Beat three eggs; 
add half a cup of sugar. Line two pie plates with crust and strew over 
enough raisins to cover bottom. Add the bread crumbs to tgg and milk, 
sifting in a bit of cinnamon, pour over the raisins and bake about 30 
minutes. 

Date Pie. — For one pie take one heaping cupful of pastry flour, add a 
pinch of salt and mix to the right consistency with sweet cream. The 
crust will be much nicer if allowed to get very cold before using. Filling 
— To a cupful of seeded dates add a cupful of water, cook over hot water 
about 20 minutes, then rub through a sieve. Beat an tgg and a table- 
spoonful of sugar until light; add a tablespoonful of lemon juice, the 
date paste and gradually a cupful of scalded milk. Pour into a half 
baked shell and finish baking in a moderate oven until a knife blade 
can penetrate it and come out clean. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 45 

Delectable Tarts. — One cup of slightly sour cream, one cup of seeded 
and chopped raisins, one cup of sugar and one tgg with a delicate flavor- 
ing of spices. Beat the tgg light, add the cream and sugar; the raisins 
well floured and spices. Bake in tart or patty pans with a single crust. 

Elderberry Pie. — Line a pie dish with paste, upon which sprinkle a 
scant tablespoonful of flour; to this add a half cup of sugar and a half 
teaspoonful each of cloves and cinnamon, rubbing all together evenly. 
Upon this pour the berries, a pint more or less according to the size of 
your pie dish; pour over another half cup of sugar, dot generously with 
butter, adding last one large tablespoonful of good vinegar. Apply top 
crust quickly and bake. 

Grape Cobbler. — This is best made from very ripe black grapes. Wash 
them twice — on the bunches and after picking. Line a deep pie dish with 
half-inch rich crust, put in the grapes and all the sugar that will lie 
between them, heaping the fruit a little in the middle. Put on the top 
crust, cut cross slits in the middle and fold back the corners to leave 
an open square. Set the dish in a quick oven and while the pie bakes 
make a sauce, using half a cup of butter, one cup of sugar and one table- 
spoon boiling water. Stir well over hot water and flavor with lemon 
juice, or grated nutmeg, according to taste. When the pie is nearly done 
take it out, pour in the sauce through the opening in the crust, return 
it to the oven. Be careful not to overbake, but keep it hot until served. 

Grape Roll. — Allow half the weight of the grapes in sugar and only 
water enough to keep from burning; seed the grapes; allow one pint of 
cooked grapes for the roll. To make the dough cream one-half teacupful 
of butter with one pint of sifted flour; add one teacupful of milk, two 
eggs well beaten, a saltspoonful of salt and a teaspoonful of baking 
powder; roll out on the board in two long ovals, roll up and pinch the 
ends, lay in a buttered dish, set the dish to bake and twice pour over 
them a sauce of a tablespoonful of butter and a tablespoonful of sugar 
mixed together, to which is added one-half teacupful of boiling water 
(for one basting). Serve the rolls with the same kind of sauce made 
richer and flavored with nutmeg. 

Green Apple Slump. — Stew and strain a quart of green apples and 
sweeten to taste. Make a biscuit crust with two cupfuls of flour, one 
heaping teaspoonful of baking powder, one tablespoonful of butter and 
one-half teaspoonful of salt, and moisten with sweet milk to a dough. 
Roll out one inch thick. Put the prepared hot sauce in a thick-bottomed 
saucepan, fit over it the crust and cover closely, first buttering the inside 
of the cover. Place where the sauce will simmer slowly but steadily 
for an hour. In serving put the crust on the dish, pour the sauce over 
it aad serve with creasi. 



40 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Hasty Pie. — Place in a deep baking pan or dish any fresh or canned 
fruits to the depth of two or three inches. Beat together one egg, two 
tablespoonfuls of melted butter, one cupful sweet milk and one cupful of 
flour in which has been sifted one teaspoonful of baking powder. Pour 
this over- fruit and bake until crust is well done. Eat with sweetened 
cream or any pudding sauce. Use but little syrup with fruit. The same 
recipe for batter makes good muffins. 

Jam Dumplings. — To one quart of sifted flour add two heaping tea- 
spoonfuls of baking powder, half teaspoonful of salt and four table- 
spoonfuls of sugar and sift several times. Beat two eggs light and add 
to a cup of milk; stir into the flour, adding a large tablespoonful of 
butter melted; add enough milk to make a soft dough; roll out, cut in 
squares, put a large spoonful of jam in center of each square, pinch the 
edges together, place them in a baking pan and bake them for 25 minutes; 
serve with vanilla sauce. 

Lady Lufkins. — Make a very rich, flaky pie crust, roll out very thin, 
cut into strips an inch wide, and wind each strip around a tube of metal 
or heavy manilla paper about two inches wide; bake until crisp and brown. 
This is the way in which bakers make their cream rolls. When cold, fill 
each roll with marmalade in the center and cream at the ends. 

Lemon Meringue. — Stir together the juice and rind of one lemon, one 
cupful of sugar, three-quarters of a cupful of water with one tablespoon- 
ful of cornstarch, and the yolks of four eggs. Bake in one crust and 
make a meringue of the four whites for the top, adding a little powdered 
sugar after having been stiffly beaten. If desired the whites of the eggs 
may be included in the filling, and two crusts used. 

Lemon Mince Pie. — Stir together two tablespoonfuls cornstarch thor- 
oughly cooked with a cupful of water, one cupful of sugar, one cupful of 
molasses, one cupful of chopped raisins, a little citron, the juice of two 
lemons, and the grated rind of one. Bake in two crusts. This makes 
several pies. 

Delicious Lemon Pie. — Beat one cup sugar, three tablespoons of flour, 
the yolks of two eggs, piece of butter size of a walnut, to a cream. Add 
the grated rind and juice of a lemon, then one cup of milk, gradually. 
Then fold in the whites of the eggs beaten to a froth. Bake in one crust. 

Maple Custard Pie. — Line a pie pan with any good paste. For the 
filling beat together the yolks of three eggs and one pint of cream; add 
one-third cup maple sugar shaved fine. Stir until the sugar is dissolved 
and bake in a quick oven. Delicious. 

Marlborough Pie. — Line a pie plate with very thin puff paste. Take 
half cup of mixed orange, lemon and citron peel. Strew these in the 
bottom of the dish. Beat the yolks of four eggs with a cup of butter aod 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 47 

scant cup of sugar. Heat in a double boiler until melted; then flavor with 
orange juice and little grated peel. Pour into the dish and bake three- 
quarters of an hour. 

Milk Pie. — Line a pan eight inches in diameter with good paste, put 
dots of butter over the bottom until you have used about the size of a 
walnut, dredge over alternately flour to the amount of one-fourth meas- 
uring cup and sugar to the amount of one-half cup, then sprinkle evenly 
over the top one level dessertspoon of cinnamon and pour in carefully, 
so as not to disturb the cinnamon, three-fourths cup milk and bake until 
crust is brown. 

Maryland Mincemeat. — Two pounds of lean beef; cook, let get cold, 
and pass through meat grinder; mix thoroughly with one pint of finely- 
minced suet, two quarts of chopped, high-flavored apples, one pint of 
stoned raisins, a scant pint of sugar, one-half pint of currants, one-third 
pound of citron shaved in fine shreds, 'a cupful of molasses (which is 
omitted if preferred, sugar taking its place), one tablespoonful each of 
ground mace and allspice, two tablespoonfuls of cinnamon, one-half table- 
spoonful of cloves, two grated nutmegs, one and a half tablespoonful of 
salt, juice and rind of one and a half lemon, same of sour orange, 
one-half cupful each of candied lemon and orange peel. Moisten with 
unfermented grape juice, sweet cider, peach or plum syrup. The syrup 
from sweet pickles is a great improvement. Pack solid in airtight jars. 

Green Tomato Mincemeat. Chop fine four quarts of green tomatoes, 
drain off all juice, cover with cold water, let come to a boil and scald 
for 30 minutes, then drain well. Add two pounds of brown sugar, one 
pound of seeded raisins, one-half pound of chopped citron, one large 
half cupful of finely-chopped suet, one tablespoonful of salt and one-half 
cupful of strong cider vinegar. Stir well together and cook till thick. 
When cold add one teaspoonful each of ground cinnamon and cloves and 
one teaspoonful of grated nutmeg. Stir thoroughly and keep (while it 
lasts) in a stone jar. 

Mock Mince Pie with Cranberries. — One cupful bread crumbs, one 
cupful raisins, one cupful sugar, one cupful cranberries cut in halves, one 
level saltspoonful each of cinnamon, cloves, allspice and nutmeg, one cup- 
ful hot water, one-half cup vinegar and butter size of a large English 
walnut. Turn into a pie tin lined with flaky paste, place the top crust 
and bake in a brisk oven. 

Mock Pumpkin Pie. — Grate sweet apples, add milk, sugar, ginger and 
cinnamon, and one egg for each pie. Make the filling of the same con- 
sistency as pumpkin, and bake just like it. 

Peach Turnovers. — One pint of dried peaches stewed and sweetened 
with two tablespoonfuls of brown sugar; flavor with nutmeg to taste. 



48 THE RURAL COOK BOOK, 

Make a stiff crust, not as short as for other pies. Roll out pieces the 
size of a saucer. Cover one-half of the crust one-half inch deep with 
the stewed fruit. Fold over, pinch the edges together and prick with a 
silver fork. Fry like doughnuts, preferably in cooking oil; powder with 
sugar and serve with maple syrup. 

Pear Puffs. — Peel good pears, cut out the blossom end, but leave the 
stem; simmer the pears until tender in a weak syrup flavored with 
lemon, then drain, and allow them to cool. Make a good, rich pie crust, 
roll out thin, cut into triangular pieces, and cover each pear, pinching the 
crust neatly together, but leaving the stem protruding. Bake in a quick 
oven to a pale brown, and serve hot or cold. 

Prune Pie. — Stew half pound of prunes as for sauce. When quite soft 
remove the stones, sweeten, beat up and gradually fold in the whites of 
two eggs. Line deep pie tins with crust and bake twenty minutes. Then 
turn in the prune mixture; spread smoothly on top and pour over this 
a layer of well-sweetened and well-flavored apple sauce. Place in oven 
and bake twenty minutes longer. Eat hot or cold. 

Prune Pie No. 2. — One cupful of stewed and stoned prunes, chopped 
fine; three tablespoonfuls of the syrup in which they were stewed, two 
eggs, yolks and white beaten separately, the whites to a stiff froth; sugar, 
salt and flavoring to taste. The prunes should be soaked an hour or two 
in warm water before stewing, then cooked slowly several hours, putting 
them on with cold water enough nearly to cover them and enough sugar 
to make a rich syrup. Bake without upper crust. 

Prune Pie No. 3. — Cover a pie tin with rich crust, and then half fill 
with a layer of stewed prunes and their juice, the stones having been 
removed. Over the prunes pour a custard, made by beating up one egg 
and a teacupful of milk, a little nutmeg being grated over the top. The 
pie is baked until the custard is set. Little patty pans lined with pie crust 
and filled with the same material, are prune fanchonettes. 

Pumpkin Pie. — This recipe differs decidedly from those ordinarily used 
and is very good. Cut the pumpkin without paring, bake it, skin side 
down, until tender, and then scoop out the pulp and sift it. For one 
pie allow IJ^ cupful of pumpkin, one cupful of boiling milk, one teaspoon- 
ful of butter, half a cupful of sugar, half a teaspoonful of salt, one- 
quarter teaspoonful of cinnamon, same amount of ginger; add one egg, 
beaten separately. Half bake the crust, fill with the pumpkin and bake. 

Pumpkin Pie Without Eggs. — Let the pumpjcin be of the pie variety, 
small, close-grained, and sweet. Steam it until tender, then press through 
a colander. To a pint of sifted pumpkin add one quart of rich milk, two 
level tablespoonfuls flour, one cupful sugar, two teaspoonfuls ginger and a 
pinch of salt. This is sufficient for two pies. Fill the crusts, sift on i 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 49 

little sugar and a dust of nutmeg, and bake. If the pumpkin is not up to 
the standard, one tgg may be added, but not as a substitute for the flour, 
which gives body and smoothness to the filling. 

Raisin Pie. — One cupful of nice raisins; wash quickly, cover with 
boiling water, cook until tender; remove seeds; moisten a cupful of bread 
crumbs with the water, add one-fourth cupful of sugar, one egg (beaten), 
one tablespoonful lemon juice and the raisins, cut in two or three pieces 
each; an upper and lower crust of tender pastry and a satisfactory bake 
make a most delicious pie. 

Raisin Pie No. 2. — Boil one pound of seeded raisins in sufficient water 
to cover for one hour. Then add the juice and grated rind of one lemon, 
a piece of butter the size of an tgg, one cupful of sugar, and two table- 
spoonfuls of cornstarch. Bake in two crusts. This makes filling for two 
pies. A second way of making a pie is to cook one cupful of raisins in 
one cupful of water until they are softened, add the grated rind and juice 
of one lemon, half a cupful of sugar, a sifting of cinnamon and sufficient 
powdered cracks crumbs to thicken. Bake in two crusts. 

Raisin Turnovers. — One cupful of seeded raisins, the rind of a lemon, 
or a few pieces of candied lemon or orange peel, and a small piece of 
preserved citron, chop all together finely, stir into this one beaten egg, 
and the juice of one lemon. Roll out puff paste thinly, and cut *it in 
circles, lay them on a plate, fill with the mixture, then cover and press 
the edges firmly together. Bake the same length of time as you would 
a pie. 

Raspberry Cream Tart. — Line a pie plate with good paste, and fill with 
red raspberries, sweetened with powdered sugar. Cover with paste, but 
do not pinch it down at the edges. When it is done, lift the top crust, 
which is thicker than usual, and pour upon the fruit a cream made as 
follows : One small cup of rich milk, heated to boiling point ; whites of 
two eggs beaten light and stirred into the boiling milk; one tablespoonful 
of white sugar; one-half teaspoonful of cornstarch wetted with cold 
milk. Boil three minutes, then let the cream get perfectly cold. Remove 
the top crust, pour the cream over the fruit, replace the crust, and set 
the pie away to cool. This recipe is given by Marion Harland; our home 
recipe for fruit cream pic calls for a simple custard, using both white and 
yolk of one &gg, which is poured over the fruit as above. Strawberry 
cream pie is made in the same way. 

Rhubarb Pie. — Cut in rather coarse pieces enough rhubarb to fill a 
large cup. Beat one egg thoroughly, adding a good pinch of salt, add 
the rhubarb, one cup of sugar and two soda crackers rolled fine. Mix 
thoroughly, then turn into a pie tin lined with pastry. Put a few bits of 
butter over it here and there, add a grating of nutmeg, and bake as a 



50 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

tart pie, bands of pastry laid over the top before baking. This quantity 
makes one pie — a small deep one, or a thin large one. 

Rhubarb Cream Pie. — One cupful of rhubarb chopped fine or grated, 
one cupful of sugar, a pinch of salt, a grating of nutmeg or lemon peel. 
Moisten a tablespoonful of cornstarch with a tablespoonful of cold water; 
then fill the cup up with boiling water, stirring until clear. Beat the 
yolks of three eggs until light, and add them with the cornstarch to the 
other materials. Line a pie plate with good light paste, fill with the 
mixture and bake in a moderately hot oven until custard is set. When 
done and cooled, cover with a meringue made with the whites of the 
eggs and half a cupful of confectioner's sugar. Brown delicately in 
the oven. 

Fresh Strawberry Pie. — Bake an empty bottom crust, making it extra 
nice; prick holes all over the bottom and sides, to prevent its getting 
out of shape. As soon as baked sprinkle the inside with sugar and fill 
with ripe berries; also well dredge with sugar.- Cover with sweetened 
whipped cream and then cover all with a meringue of the frothed whites 
of two eggs mixed with two tablespoonfuls of sugar and a dash of 
lemon juice. Invert a plate in the oven and place the pie plate on top 
of it and brown. If the work is very carefully done the berries will not 
be even heated, and the result will be delicious. The pie should be 
thoroughly chilled before serving. 

Strawberry Pie No. 2. — Line a pie tin with rich crust shortened with 
butter, no baking powder being used. Let it cool, then fill with fresh 
strawberries, hulled and washed, and mixed with sugar. Cover with 
whipped cream and serve. 

Strawberry Pie No, 3. — Line a pie plate with good short crust, fill 
with ripe whole berries, liberally sugared, and then cover with a lattice 
formed of criss-cross strips of crust. By the time the crust is browned 
the berries are cooked in their own rich juice, and the pie is much 
nicer than v/ith an ordinary double crust. 

Strawberry Cream Pie. — After picking over the berries carefully, 
arrange them in layers in a deep pie plate, sprinkling sugar thickly 
between each layer, having first lined the dish with your best pastry. 
Cover with a crust with a slit in the top and bake. When the pie is 
baked, pour into the slit in the top of the pie the following cream mix- 
ture: Take a small cupful of rich cream, heat until nearly boiling, then 
stir into it the whites of two eggs beaten lightly to a froth, also a table- 
spoonful of granulated or powdered sugar; boil all together a few 
moments. When cool, pour it into the pie through the slit in the crust 
Serve with powdered sugar sifted on top. 



CHAPTER V. 

PUDDINGS, HOT AND COLD. 

The proof of the pudding is not in the eating, 
Never mind what the old sayings state ; 

The compliment setting the cook's heart a'beating 
Is the call for a big second plate. 

As a rule farm housekeepers are admirably situated for making 
delicious puddings, many of which are more wholesome than pastry. 
The recipes given below include considerable variety, and will be found 
suggestive, as many may be altered to suit material on hand. We were 
obliged to omit a number of good ones, owing to lack of space. 

Apricot Pudding. — This may be made from evaporated apricots, care- 
fully soaked and stewed, instead of the canned fruit. Butter a shallow 
pudding dish and sprinkle on the surface a layer of soft bread crumbs. 
Drain the syrup from a can of apricots and arrange a layer of fruit in 
the dish. Fill the cavities with sugar and a dot of butter the size of a 
pea on each. Cover each piece of fruit with another half to simulate the 
whole fruit, then fill the interstices with soft bread crumbs. Mix one pint 
of milk, the yolks of three eggs, well beaten, with one-quarter teaspoon 
of salt and three teaspoonfuls sugar, and pour this over the fruit. Lift 
the fruit a little so the custard may reach every part of the bread. Bake 
it about half an hour. Beat the whites of the eggs till stiff; add three 
heaped tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar and three teaspoonfuls of 
lemon juice. When the pudding is done and cooked somewhat spread 
the meringue over the top and brown it slightly. Serve hot without sauce. 

Batter Pudding. — This is an old-fashioned recipe, which can be 
depended upon. Measure 12 tablespoonfuls of flour after sifting; then 
sift again with a teaspoonful of baking powder and a small one of salt. 
Beat four eggs, without separating, until very light and before mixing 
them to a batter with a quart of milk, butter a three-pint oval baking 
dish and see that the oven is of a steady heat, as if for baking bread. 
Now make a smooth batter with the milk and flour, stirring in the eggs 
last, and bake about one hour The pudding will rise with a brown crust 
on top, and, by the slow bakmg, the sides and bottom will also be crisp 
and brown, while the interior will be tender and light. Serve directly 
from the oven, with fruit juice slightly thickened for sauce. No other 
sauce will take the place of this. When the supply of extra juice canned 
for this very purpose is exhausted, evaporated cherries soaked over night 
and well simmered in the same water is an excellent substitute 



52 THE RURAL COOK BOOK, 

Black Pudding. — One coffeecup black molasses, one coffeecup sour 
cream; add one dessertspoon of soda and beat hard and then add one 
cup chopped suet, one cup seeded raisins, a few almonds (about a table- 
spoonful), do not blanch them, as they will have a better flavor, three 
(or more if liked) chopped figs, two apples, and a piece of citron 
chopped. Three cups of flour, one-half teaspoonful of salt and the grat- 
ing of one-half nutmeg. Beat well. Take four baking powder cans 
(pound size), rub with melted butter and pour the batter into them and 
steam hard three hours. Stand in oven ten or fifteen minutes to dry off. 
When you wish to use steam half an hour. A quantity may be made at 
one time, as these puddings will keep six months. 

Blackberry Pudding. — Beat one-third of a cup of butter to a cream. 
Add gradually half a cup of sugar and the beaten yolks of two eggs. 
Sift together two cups of previously sifted flour, four level teaspoonfuls 
of baking powder and half a teaspoonful of salt. Add this to the 
creamed butter, sugar, and eggs. Put in half of the flour mixture, mix, 
and then put in half a cupful of cold water. Mix in the rest of the 
flour, etc. Beat thoroughly and last of all fold in the well-beaten whites 
of the two eggs. Sprinkle a cupful of blackberries with a little flour 
and add them to the batter as it is dropped a spoonful at a time, into the 
mold, which should be rubbed with unsalted butter. Steam an hour and 
a half, or bake twenty-five minutes, and serve with a blackberry hard 
sauce. The sauce is made in the usual way, with half a cup of butter 
and a cup of sugar. Add to this half a cupful of crushed berries. 

Blueberry Betty. — Put a pint of milk in a double boiler and put on 
the fire to scald. Pick over, wash and drain a pint of fresh blueberries. 
Have ready a pint of soft whole wheat bread crumbs. Put a layer of 
crumbs in a buttered pudding dish, then a layer of berries, then more 
crumbs and so on until the dish is full, having crumbs on top. Stir two 
tablespoonfuls of sugar in the milk, and when hot pour it over the con- 
tents of the dish. Cover and set in the oven to bake for about an hour. 
Stand the pudding dish in a basin of hot water. Serve with a tart sauce. 
Blueberry Pudding. — Beat 1^ cupful sugar with four eggs, add one 
pint milk and one cupful flour, in which sift one tablespoonful baking 
powder, one-half teaspoonful salt; add one cupful whole blueberries; pour 
in a buttered covered mold; set in boiling water,, letting water only 
come a little more than half way up to the mold; weight down and boil 
continuously for one hour; slip on to a dish and cover with sauce, then 
sprinkle over uncooked fruit. Sauce — Beat one cupful granulated sugar 
with one cupful butter to a cream; then add yolks of two eggs, one- 
quarter teaspoonful vanilla. 

Baked Blueberry Pudding. — One quart ripe, fresh berries, mace or 
nutmeg one-half teaspoonful; three eggs well beaten, separately; sugar,

two cups; cold butter, one tablespoon; sweet milk, one cup; flour, one 
pint; baking powder, two teaspoons. Roll berries well in flour, add 
them last. Bake half hour and serve with sauce. Delicious. 

Steamed Blueberry Puffs. — Beat two eggs until light and thick, with- 
out separating; add half a cupful of sugar and half a cupful of milk; 
sift together three level teaspoonfuls of baking powder, half a teaspoon- 
ful of salt and two cupfuls of flour, stir into the liquid ingredients; then 
stir in one cup of blueberries. Turn into buttered cups and steam half 
an hour. The batter should drop easily from the end of the spoon. 
Serve hot with cream and sugar. 

Bread and Butter Pudding. — Strew half a cupful of currants in the 
bottom of a baking dish, then butter some slices of freshly-baked bread 
and lay in the dish. Make a custard with two eggs and a pint of milk, 
sweeten to taste, and pour it over; grate a little nutmeg over the top and 
bake a light brown. This pudding should be baked in the dish in which 
it is to be sent to table. It is delicious eaten with stewed fruit. 

Steamed Bread and Butter Pudding. — Butter a small pudding bowl. 
Cut some thin bread and butter, decorate the bottom of the basin with 
candied peel cut in stars, or a few raisins or preserved cherries ; put in 
the slices of bread and butter, dusting each slice with sugar and sprinkling 
with a few chopped preserved cherries. When full beat up an egg with 
half a pint of milk, flavor with essence of almonds, and strain over the 
pudding. Leave to soak for a while, cover with buttered paper, and 
steam for an hour and a quarter. Turn out, and serve with custard. 

Bread Pudding in Disguise. — Break half a loaf of bread into pieces 
and soak in milk, just what the bread will take up. Then add an egg 
and a cup of sugar and a cup of rich, creamy milk in which put half 
teaspoonful of saleratus and teaspoonful of cream of tartar. Bake until 
light and well browned in a medium oven. To serve pour a little maple 
syrup over each dish. 

Brown Betty. — Mix a cupful of sugar and a level teaspoonful of 
cinnamon. Prepare about a quart of sliced tart apples. Stir into a pint 
of soft bread crumbs about half a cupful of melted butter. Butter well 
a deep pudding dish, put in a layer of crumbs, then sliced apples and 
sprinkle with sugar, then another layer of crumbs, apples and sugar and 
continue until the materials are used with a thick layer of crumbs on the 
top. Bake about an hour in a moderate oven. If the oven browns on 
the bottom set in a pan of hot water or bake on the top grate of the oven, 
covering the pudding well to prevent too crisp an upper crust. Serve 
with hard sauce made as follows : Cream a third of a cupful of butter, 
add gradually a cupful of powdered sugar and when beaten to a cream 
add drop by drop to prevent separation, two tablespoonfuls of rich cream. 
Flavor with vanilla or lemon juice.

Carrot Pudding. — Mix together one cupful of grated bread crumbs, 
a quarter of a pound each of flour and of butter, one-half pound of 
preserved cherries, and one-half pound of sugar and a saltspoonful of 
salt. Boil six young carrots until they are tender, then pass them 
through a sieve and add half a pound of this pulp to the other ingredi- 
ents. Stir the mixture well, then steam it in a buttered mold for 2^^ 
hours. In the Winter we make an imitation plum pudding in which a 
cupful of grated carrot is used, the carrot both lightening and 
enriching it. 

Cherry Cups. — Pleasure a pint of sifted flour, add two teaspoonfuls 
of baking powder and half a tcaspoonful of salt and sift again. Mix to 
a soft dough with cold water. Butter little custard cups and drop in a 
little of the dough and then add a teaspoonful of the cherries ; cover 
these with more dough (the cups should not be more than half full). 
Set the cups in a steamer, or if you have no steamer you can put them 
in a deep baking pan with a little boiling watgr ; cover closely with 
another pan and steam half an hour in the oven. Eat with cherry sauce 
or sweetened cream. On bread baking day you can make these with 
bread dough instead of the baking powder dough. 

Cherry Batter Pudding. — Prepare a cupful of stoned cherries. Beat 
two eggs separately, add half a pint of milk, or better still, sweet cream, 
to the yolks, and to this one tablespoonful of melted butter. Have ready 
1^ cupful of flour, into which two teaspoonfuls of baking powder have 
been sifted, with a dash of salt. Add this to the yolks of the eggs and 
milk, and lastly add the whites of the eggs, beaten light. Beat vigor- 
ously for a few minutes and turn into a greased baking pan, allowing the 
batter to be about an inch thick. Cover it with the cherries, add oncrthird 
of a cup of granulated sugar, sprinkled lightly on the top, and bake in a 
quick oven for 30 minutes. Serve hot with hard sauce or a sauce made 
from a cup of cherries and half a cup of sugar stewed together until the 
cherries are reduced to a pulp. Sauce as well as pudding should be 
served hot. 

Boiled Cherry Pudding. — Beat three eggs light without separating; add 
a pint of milk. Sift two teaspoonfuls of baking powder and a half a 
teaspoonful of salt in a little less than a quart of sifted flour aiid add the 
liquid gradually to the flour, stirring to a smooth batter. Add a teaspoon- 
ful of melted butter. Beat thoroughly and then stir in a pint of cherries, 
stoned and drained free from juice and well floured. Turn into a well- 
buttered pudding dish or mold, or an old-fashioned pudding bag, scalded 
and floured, and cook in a kettle of boiling water for three hours. Keep 
the water boiling continually or the pudding will be heavy. If cooked 
in a mold or dish, the water must not be deep enough to boil over the 
pudding. If in a bag, there must be sufficient water to keep the pudding 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 55 

from touching the bottom of the kettle. Serve with hard or foamy sauce. 

Cherry Pudding in Winter. — Nearly fill a buttered baking dish with 
the sour canned cherries. Use just enough of the juice so the cherries 
will be moist. Spread over this a dough made from one-fourth teacupful 
sugar, one tablespoonful butter, one-half cupful milk, one tgg, a little 
salt, one cupful flour (use a little more if necessary to make dough like 
cake), one teaspoonful baking powder. Bake half an hour. Sauce to 
serve with it is made as follows : One-half cupful butter, one-half cupful 
sugar, one tablespoonful of flour or cornstarch. Mix thoroughly. To this 
add a pint of the cherry juice. Boil till it thickens. 

Canned Cherry Tapioca. — Cover a scant cupful of tapioca with cold 
watef and let it soak over night. In the morning place over the fire with 
a saltspoonful of salt and a pint of boiling water; simmer slowly until 
the tapioca is perfectly clear. Stir a pint of stoned cherries into the 
boiling tapioca ; add a cupful of sugar (more if the cherries are very 
sour) ; turn into a serving dish and set away to cool. Serve with 
whipped cream. 

Chocolate Pudding. — Put into a bowl two cupfuls of stale bread- 
crumbs. Pour over them one quart of scalded milk. While the bread 
and milk are cooling melt two squares of chocolate. Mix the chocolate 
with two-thirds of a cup of sugar, then, with two eggs, lightly beaten, one 
scant saltspoonful of salt and a teaspoonful of vanilla. Add the milk 
and breadcrumbs and then, when well mixed, turn the whole into a pud- 
ding dish that has been buttered and sugared. Bake it one hour in a 
moderately hot oven. Serve cold, with cream. This pudding can be 
baked in individual molds if preferred. 

Steamed Chocolate Pudding. — Boil one quart of fresh milk and pour 
over one pint grated bread crumbs, one-fourth cake grated chocolate, one 
cup sugar, one cup flour, one cup butter, two teaspoons baking powder, 
one cup raisins, one cup chopped nuts. Steam two hours and serve with 
a sauce. 

Chocolate Tapioca. — Soak three tablespoonfuls of tapioca in a cup of 
cold water for half an hour; add three pints of hot milk, one cupful of 
sugar, yolks of two eggs and three tablespoonfuls of grated chocolate. 
Cook in a double boiler until the tapioca is tender. Serve with a meringue 
made from the whites of two eggs and powdered sugar or whipped cream. 

Cider Pudding. — Mix a cupful of cider, a cupful of molasses, a cupful 
of suet, a cupful of seeded raisins, half a teaspoonful of salt, one tea- 
spoonful of soda and flour enough to make a stiff batter. Steam three 
hours. 

Baked Cider Pudding. — Cream 1^^ tablespoonful butter, add three 
tablespoonfuls granulated sugar and one t^g. Beat all together until 
very light. Add half a cupful of cider. Into one cup of flour put one- 



5« THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

half teaspoonful cinnamon, one-quarter teaspoonful of ground cloves. 
Sift this into the batter and add a quarter cupful each of currants and 
Sultana raisins mixed with a quarter cupful of flour. Add one-quarter 
teaspoonful baking soda with the last bit of flour and beat briskly for 
a minute or two. Pour into a well-greased mold and steam one hour 
and a half; turn out carefully, as the -texture is delicate, and serve hot 
with orange sauce. 

Cider Bread Pudding. — Butter freely several slices of light bread. 
Place a layer in pudding dish, cover with a few slices of tart apples; 
repeat until the dish is full. To a quart of good cider add a cup of 
sugar and pour over. Bake slowly and serve either hot or cold with 
cream. 

Citron Pudding. — A quart of fresh milk, a pint of stale bread crumbs, 
carefully grated, four eggs, a coffee cup of powdered sugar, half a pound 
of citron cut fine, a small amount of butter and the juice and rind of 
one lemon. The yolks and sugar are beaten together and the bread 
crumbs, milk and lemon rind added by degrees. This is poured into a 
buttered dish, the citron dropped in and a piece of butter placed over 
all. The baking required half an hour and the preparation when cold 
is covered with a meringue made of four whites, a cup of powdered 
sugar and the juice of a lemon. This is browned slightly before serving. 

Cocoanut Pudding. — Otie-half cupful of cocoanut, one-half cupful of 
bread crumbs, one pint of milk, one egg, one tablespoonful of butter, 
two tablespoonfuls of sugar and one level saltspoonful of salt. Soak 
the bread crumbs and cocoanut in the milk for three hours ; mash the 
bread fine, and add the sugar, salt and melted butter. Beat the white 
and yolk of the tgg separately, and add first the yolk and then the white, 
stirring well. Place all in a well-buttered pudding dish and bake half 
an hour. Serve hot without sauce. 

Coffee Pudding. — Boil three-fourths of a cup of ground coffee in 
one quart water 10 minutes; then add one-half ounce gelatine which 
had been soaked 15 minutes; then add one cup sugar; boil one minute; 
then strain through a cloth, set aside to get cold; when almost jellied 
beat one-half pint cream till near stiff, then add the coffee jelly, gradu- 
ally beating all the time. When all is well mixed flavor with vanilla, 
and set in a cold place to harden. It can be served alone, or with cream. 
The recipe is enough for six people. 

Colonial Pudding. — When baking bread put a piece of the dough into 
a pound baking powder tin and bake this for the top of the pudding. 
Soak some slices of Boston brown bread in scalded milk for two hours. 
Then beat up well, add a cupful of raisins, a little chopped mixed peel, 
half a teaspoonful of mixed spice, half a cupful of sugar, and two ounces 
of beef suet, chopped very fine, or a piece of butter the size of an egg. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 57 

Mix all well together, adding cold milk as you mix it, and then put into 
a buttered baking dish. A lound, shallow dish is the best to use, and 
it should also be one that can be sent to the table. Now cut the white 
bread into slices, butter them, and lay them closely together on the top 
of the pudding mixture. Grate a little nutmeg over all, and bake in a 
moderate oven for an hour and a half, covering it for an hour and 
taking off the cover for the half hour so that it may be a nice light brown. 

Cottage Pudding. — One cup sugar, two eggs, one pint sweet milk, two 
scant teaspoons baking powder, flavoring and flour to make a batter as 
stiff as cake dough. Bake three-quarters of an hour in a moderate 
oven and serve with milk or hot sauce. To make hot sauce cream 
together one tablespoon butter and two of flour with half cup of sugar. 
Slowly add enough boiling water to make it thin and smooth. Then 
proceed to add boiling water to make it the consistency of thin starch. 
Boil a few minutes and flavor before serving. 

Steamed Cranberry Dumplings. — Make the dumplings of good, pre- 
pared flour, which cannot fail to be light, using one pint of it; add a 
pinch of salt and mix with milk to a paste just stiff enough to drop by 
tablespoonfuls on the buttered steamer bottom; steam over boiling water 
about half an hour. Serve immediately; first carefully split the fluffy 
rolls open, lightly butter and put between a tablespoonful of stewed cran- 
berry sauce (warm) ; pour over a foamy sauce made as follows: Three 
tablespoonfuls of milk, stirred into one beaten egg, a half cupful of sugar 
and one teaspoonful of flour; beat hard and put into double boiler; pour 
on slowly a cup of boiling water, stir constantly until the sauce thickens, 
then add one teaspoonful of butter and one of strawberry flavoring. 

Cranberry Pot-pie. — Butter a porcelain stewpan or kettle; put in a 
pint of berries, sprinkled with one cupful sugar; make a pint of biscuit 
dough, shape into a large ring and lay on the fruit in the kettle; then 
pour another pint of berries into and around the cup of dough, adding 
another cupful of sugar; pour one pint of boiling water into the center, 
cover closely and stew steadily for 20 minutes. When done turn from 
the kettle on to a platter; serve with cream and sugar. 

Cranberry Pudding. — Sift and measure one pint of flour; add two 
teaspoonfuls baking powder and half a teaspoonful of salt. Sift again 
until all are thoroughly blended. Add enough sweet milk to make a 
soft batter. Stir in one cup of cranberries that have been coarsely 
chopped. Pour into a pudding bag or a porcelain-lined mold. If the bag 
is used boil one and one-half hour in plenty of water. If the mold is used, 
steam the pudding two hours. 

Baked Cranberry Pudding. — Put a layer of coarsely crumbled bread in 
bottom of buttered dish; then a layer of seeded raisins and stewed cran- 
berries, a few bits of butter, and a few drops of vanilla extract; repeat 



58 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

bread, butter, vanilla and fruit until dish is full; have crutnbs and but- 
ter top layer ; bake until puffy and brown ; then decorate with meringue 
and place in very moderate oven to set the latter, but not brown. 

Cream Curds. — Beat four eggs and stir them into a quart of milk 
slightly warmed. New milk was originally called for. Add a little salt 
and turn the mixture into a covered earthen pot. A bean pot or cas- 
serole will answer. Set the pot in a pan of warm water over the fire. 
As soon as the milk cracks turn it carefully out on a sieve covered with 
a linen cloth. When the draining is complete put the curds in a glass 
dish in large spoonfuls. 

Cup Custards. — In making cup custards, it is a pleasant change to 
put in each cup, before the custard is poured in, a tablespoonful of 
either strawberry or raspberry jam. The custard cups should be stood 
in a baking pan containing hot water while baking; every custard should 
be cooked in this way. A date custard is made and baked in the ordi- 
nary manner; then, after baking, the top is covered with stoned dates, 
which may be filled with nuts if desired, and rolled in powdered sugar. 
The dates are covered with a meringue, which is browned in the oven, 
and the custard is then served cold. 

Peach Custard. — Slice ripe peaches in a glass dish and sugar them 
well two hours before they are to be served. Make a boiled custard by 
taking three eggs, one and one-half pints sweet milk and one tablespoon 
corn starch and one cup of sugar. Boil after thoroughly beating together 
in a double boiler till thick and smooth. Pour over peaches and serve 
while slightly warm. 

Date Puffs. — Two eggs, one cupful of sugar, one quarter of a cupful 
of butter, the same of milk, one teaspoonful of baking powder and flour 
enough to make a thin batter. Stir in one cupful of stoned dates; fill 
muffin cups half full and steam 30 minutes. Serve with a liquid sauce 
or with sweetened cream. 

Economy Pudding. — Take two cupfuls of ginger cookie crumbs 
(crumbled cookies) and one cupful sweet milk, one cupful molasses, one 
teaspoonful cinnamon, one-fourth teaspoonful cloves, one-fourth tea- 
spoonful nutmeg, three eggs well beaten, one-half teaspoonful salt, one 
cup seeded raisins, one-half teaspoonful of soda dissolved in one table- 
spoonful of water and two cupfuls of flour. Beat thoroughly, turn into 
greased pudding pan and steam three hours. Serve with hard sauce. 

Farina Pudding. — Place a double boiler with one pint of milk over 
the fire; when it boils, sprinkle in two and a half tablespoonfuls farina, 
one-quarter teaspoonful salt and two tablespoonfuls sugar. Cook 
twenty minutes, then add the beaten whites of two eggs, stir for a few 
minutes, remove from fire, pour into a mold and set aside to cool. 
Serve with orange sauce made in following manner: Stir the yolk« of 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 59 

two eggs with half cupful sugar to a cream, add half cupful orange 
juice and one tablespoonful lemon juice, add last the beaten white of one 
egg and serve. Or a vanilla sauce may be served with the pudding. 

Fruit Puffs. — Fill old cups or baking cans to the depth of two inches 
with strawberries, sliced apples, or any kind of berries and cover with a 
layer of sugar. Put in each cup a small lump of butter and completely 
cover the berries with a batter made of one tg^, one pint sweet milk, 
one and one-half teaspoon baking powder and flour to make rather stiffer 
than for pancakes. Bake 40 minutes in a steady oven. 

Gingerbread Pudding. — One cupful of molasses, one cupful of sugar, 
one-half cupful of melted lard or butter, salt; all kinds of spice — one- 
fourth teaspoonful of each — one cupful of buttermilk, two scant tea- 
spoonfuls of soda, one cupful of raisins or sliced apples, flour for stiff 
batter. Steam in a covered pudding dish two hours. Hot water may 
be substituted for buttermilk; then use half the quantity of soda. 
Whipped cream is better than sugar with this. 

Gooseberry Charlotte. — Stew a pint of ripe or nearly ripe gooseberries 
for 10 minutes very slowly, not to break them. Cut six or eight slices 
of stale plain cake; line the bottom of your pudding dish with them; 
put next a layer of the gooseberries sprinkled thickly with sugar; more 
cake, more berries, and so on until the dish is full. Cover closely and 
steam in a moderate oven 20 or 25 minutes. You will find the juice of 
the berries sufficient moisture. Serve hot with a good pudding sauce. 

Gooseberry Fool. — According to the original English recipe it was 
merely gooseberry sauce enriched with cream; American authorities, how- 
ever, use eggs and butter instead of cream. To make it English fashion, 
stew either green or ripe gooseberries, after topping and stemming them, 
until tender, in just enough water to prevent burning, strain through a 
sieve, sweeten and then stir in as much rich cream as taste dictates; 
pour into a glass dish, and set away in a cool place. A very delicious 
dessert is made by using this gooseberry fool as filling for charlottes, 
lining either one large mold or small individual cups with ladies' fingers 
or small slices of sponge cake, and then filling with the gooseberry mix- 
ture, putting whipped cream on the top. The American recipe adds to 
one quart of ripe gooseberries, stewed and strained, the yolks of four 
eggs, one cupful of sugar, and one tablespoonful of butter, beaten to- 
gether until light. Pour into a glass dish, and heap on top the whites 
uf the eggs, beaten with two tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar. 

Gooseberry Pudding. — Green gooseberries mixed with rhubarb make 
a nice combination for pie or puddings. Of course plenty of sugar is 
needed. For gooseberry pudding line a mold with baking powder or suet 
crust (preferably the latter), fill with gooseberries alone or mixed with 
rhubarb, sugar liberally, add a little water, and cover; steam three houri. 



60 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Graham Pudding. — Make a batter of a cupful of molasses, a cupful 
of sweet milk, a cupful of seeded and chopped raisins, two cupfuls of 
graham flour and two teaspoonfuls of soda. Steam for three hours. 
Eat with a sauce made of a tablespoonful of butter creamed with half 
a cupful of sugar and the stiffly beaten white of an tgg and lemon to 
flavor. 

Graham Date Pudding. — Stone a cupful of dates and add them to a 
pint of boiling water, two tablespoonfuls of sugar and a pinch of salt. 
Set on the fire and stir in graham flour to make a moderately thick por- 
ridge. Cook thoroughly, set away to get cold. Serve with whipped cream. 

Graham Plum Pudding. — One egg, one cup molasses, one cup sweet 
milk, one teaspoonful soda, one-half teaspoonful salt, two cupfuls gra- 
ham flour, one-half cupful raisins. Mix and steam three hours. Serve 
with this sauce : One tablespoonful butter, one tablespoonful sugar, one 
tablespoonful white flour, the yolk of one tgg. Add hot water and let 
it boil, then white of tgg and flavor. 

Grape Pudding. — Soak one-half a box of gelatine in one-half a cup 
of cold water, until soft; add one cup of boiling water, juice of one 
lemon, one cup of sugar and one pint of grape juice. Set aside to cool 
until it begins to stiffen, then fold in the stiffly beaten whites of two 
eggs. Run into a mold. When ready to serve unmold and garnish with 
whipped cream. A bunch of grapes may be placed on the top of the 
mold. This will serve eight persons. 

Grape Pudding No. 2. — This is an old-fashioned dish which may be 
either boiled or baked. Delaware grapes are best for it. Wash, pick 
and flour well before putting into the batter. A heaping pint of picked 
grapes makes a fair-sized pudding. For the batter beat four eggs very 
light, whites and yolks separate, mix smoothly with the yolks half a 
pint of milk and one pint of flour sifted twice. Add half a cupful of 
butter beaten to a cream, and last of all the whites of eggs, stirring them 
in with long, swift strokes, all the same way. The grapes go in at the 
very last, and the bag or the pan ought to be ready before they are 
added. Boil the pudding three hours, and serve with a rich grape juice 
sauce. For a baked pudding the white of one e.gg may be kept out, and 
used for a meringue. Serve with the same sauce. 

Huckleberry Blanc Mange. — Heat one quart of milk in a double boiler 
(reserving one-third of a cupful with which to mix three tablespoonfuls 
of cornstarch). Add one-half cupful of sugar and a pinch of salt. 
When the milk is scalding hot, stir in the cornstarch, and cook for five 
minutes. Pour this on the well-beaten whites of two eggs and beat 
thoroughly. When cool pour a little of it into a wetted mold, strew 
over this fresh blueberries, then another portion of the blanc mange, 
then more of the blueberries (using a pint in all), finish with the blanc

mange and set on ice to harden. When ready to serve turn out on a 
flat glass or china jelly plate and serve with either whipped or plain 
cream, slightly sweetened. 

Huckleberry Pudding. — Ingredients : One pint of New Orleans mo- 
lasses, a quart of huckleberries, a teaspoonful of baking soda, a teaspoon- 
ful each of powdered cinnamon, ginger and cloves and 1^ teacupful of 
flour. Put the molasses in a bowl, dissolve soda in a little water and 
stir in molasses; add spice, fruit and flour and pour the mixture in the 
pudding mold. Tie the lid on and set it in a pot of boiling water for 
three hours. 

Huckleberry Indian Pudding. — Mix together two quarts of warm milk, 
three-fourths cupful finely-chopped suet, two tablespoonfuls molasses, a 
half teaspoonful of soda, a teaspoonful of salt and enough Indian meal 
to make a stiff batter. Add at the last two eggs, whites and yolks 
beaten separately, and a quart of huckleberries dredged with flour. Boil 
for two and one-half hours in a buttered bag or mold, never allowing 
the water to stop boiling, and serve hot with foamy sauce. 

Hulnah Pudding. — Wash a cupful of rice and add to it a quart of 
milk, a cupful of sugar and a teaspoonful of cornstarch dissolved in a 
little cold milk. Flavor with quarter of a nutmeg grated. Bake an hour 
and a half, stirring down occasionally, but do not stir down the skin 
which forms on top ; then let it brown. When done take from the oven, 
remove the brown skin and when the pudding is cool lay over the top 
preserved strawberries or cherries. Make a meringue with the whites 
of three eggs and three tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar, and heap 
over the top of the fruit. Set in the oven a moment to brown a delicate 
color. Eat with cream. 

Indian Pudding. — One pint of skim~m.\\\i scalded. While hot stir in 
smoothly two cupfuls of Indian meal, add a little salt, a teaspoonful 
of cinnamon and half a cupful of molasses, also the same of sugar. 
Stir well. Now add a quart of cold skim-milk, and mix lightly as pos- 
sible. Bake slowly for two hours. Your finished product will be fra- 
grant, rich, golden, trembling in its sweet jellied whey. Now add the 
last touch. When you serve it, put a heaping spoonful of nice apple 
sauce flavored with nutmeg over the top, and if you like another spoon- 
ful of whipped cream over that. 

Indian Apple Pudding. — Take one-half of a cup of molasses, one quart 
of milk, one teaspoonful of salt, three scant cups of pared and sliced 
apples, to which add a quarter of a teaspoonful of ginger and cinna- 
mon. When the milk boils in the double boiler, pour it slowly on the 
meal. Cook half an hour in the boiler, stirring often. Now add the 
other ingredients; pour into a deep, well greased pudding dish and bake 
«lowly. Eat with cream or maple syrup. 



63 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Boiled Indian Pudding. — One cupful of milk, one cupful of com meal, 
one tgg, one tablespoonful of sugar, one tablespoonful of beef suet 
minced fine and strings removed, one-half teaspoonful each of salt and 
ground cinnamon, one-third saltspoonful of soda in the milk. (Sour milk 
may be used, in which case take one-half teaspoonful of soda.) Heat 
the milk with the soda; when boiling stir in the meal, salt and suet and 
set aside to cool. When cold beat in the spice, sugar and whipped 
eggs and stir vigorously. Boil in a well-greased brown bread mold for 
three hours. Leave plenty of room for the pudding to swell. Serve 
with hard sauce or caramel, maple sugar or molasses. The recipe may 
be doubled and divided in two molds for steaming — one to be set aside 
in a cool place and used in a week. A cupful of chopped, floured rai- 
sins, dates, or cooked dried apricots may be added. For molasses sauce, 
use one cupful of molasses, one and a half tablespoonful of butter, two 
tablespoonfuls of lemon juice, a dash each of nutmeg and cinnamon. 
Boil molasses, spices and butter five minutes, remove from fire and add 
lemon juice. Serve very hot. 

New England Indian Pudding. — Take one pint of milk, scald it and 
pour it over two heaping tablespoonfuls of Indian meal, in which a 
saltspoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful of cinnamon, one-quarter of a 
whole nutmeg grated, have been blended. Stir briskly, and when per- 
fectly smooth add one-third cup of chopped suet, one-third cup of mo- 
lasses ; when this is well mixed add one pint of cold milk. Beat well, 
turn into a greased dish, set it in another containing warm water and 
bake three hours in a moderate oven. Serve hot with hard sauce. 
This pudding will look as if it had cream and eggs in it, and it should 
be stirred gently three times during the first hour and a half. 

Old-Fashioned Indian Pudding. — One quart of milk, one quart of 
Indian meal, three eggs, three heaping tablespoonfuls of sugar, one tea- 
spoonful of salt and one-half pound of beef suet chopped into powder. 
Scald the milk and while boiling hot stir in the meal and suet with the 
salt. When cold, add the yolks, beaten light with the sugar, then the 
whites. Dip your bag in hot water, flour it and fill half full with the 
mixture, as it will swell very much. Boil five hours. Eat very hot, 
with butter and sugar. This pudding is even better when baked in a 
well-buttered dish for an hour and a half. Bake, covered, for an hour 
and a quarter, then brown. 

Kenilworth Pudding. — Two cupfuls of light chopped bread, one-half 
cupful chopped suet, taking care to free it from all strings, one-half 
cupful of molasses, one tgg, one cupful raisins, seeded or the seedless, 
one cupful sweet milk, with one-half teaspoonful soda dissolved in it, 
one-half teaspoonful powdered cloves., one teaspoonful cinnamon and a

pinch of mace and salt. Mix thoroughly and boil two hours in a tin 
pudding dish. Eat with foamy sauce. 

Lemon Pudding. — Grate the rinds of two lemons and squeeze over 
them the juice to keep moist Beat together two eggs, one and one- 
half cups sugar, two tablespoons cornstarch or flour, tablespoon butter 
and enough cold water to thoroughly moisten. Place in double boiler 
and add one and one-half pint boiling water, stirring till the mass is 
smooth and thick. Just before removing from fire add the rind and 
juice of the lemons and beat thoroughly. Cover with a meringue made 
of one white of tgg and two tablespoons of sugar and then slightly 
brown in the oven. 

Maple Custard. — Scald one pint of rich milk in a double boiler and 
when hot add a tablespoonful of cornstarch mixed with one-third of a 
cupful of cold milk. Just before taking from the fire add two table- 
spoonfuls of fine-shaved maple sugar and the beaten yolks of three eggs. 
Stir until smooth, adding when cool a pinch of salt and half a tea- 
spoonful of vanilla. Use whites of the eggs with sugar for frosting. 
By including whites of eggs in the custard and omitting the cornstarch 
a delicious cup-custard can be made. 

Molasses Bread Pudding. — Stir into one quart of milk one pint of 
bread crumbs, one cup of molasses, one cup of raisins, seeded, cinna- 
mon and nutmeg to flavor. Bake in a slow oven for three hours, stir- 
ring a little when first heated. Serve hot with cream. 

Peach Roll. — Into four cups of flour sift two teaspoons of baking 
powder, add two cups sour cream, one teaspoon soda and a pinch of 
salt. Roll out thin and cover with canned peaches which have been 
drained from the juice. Sprinkle with sugar. Cut the dough into strips 
and roll up. Bake or steam one-half hour. If baked, pour a little 
water into the pan. Serve with the reserved juice or with cream and 
sugaf. 

Peach Tapioca. — Soak one-half cupful of tapioca over night in plenty 
of cold water. Cover the bottom of a buttered pudding dish with a 
layer of canned peaches, pour over this the tapioca, which has been 
sweetened with one tablespoonful of sugar, put over this another layer 
of the peaches and bake in a moderate oven for half an hour. Beat the 
whites of two eggs until very stiff, add two tablespoonfuls of sugar, 
spread this over the peaches and return to the oven until a delicate 
brown. Add more sugar to the juice left from the canned peaches, beat 
one-half cupful of cream until light, pour gradually over it the peach 
juice, beat all together and serve with dessert. This dish is good served 
either cold or hot. 

Pear Charlotte. — Slightly moisten six slices of stale bread with cold 
water, spread them with soft butter, put half of them in the bottom of 



64 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

a buttered pudding dish, spread over them two cupfuls of finely chopped 
ripe pears and sprinkle with four tablespoonfuls of sugar, a grating of 
nutmeg and a tablespoonful of lemon juice. Lay over them the re- 
mainder of the bread, another two cupfuls of the chopped pears and 
nutmeg, sugar and lemon juice as before. Pour over one cupful of thin 
maple syrup, cover closely and bake in a slow oven for one hour. Serve 
hot with whipped cream or maple syrup. 

Pear Pudding. — Put one quart of canned pears into a baking dish ; 
add a finger length of stick cinnamon and three cloves. If the pears 
have not been sweetened sufficiently when put up add sugar to make 
them quite sweet, teaspoonful of butter and dredge a teaspoonful of 
flour over the top. Place the dish on the range where it will heat while 
you mix a pint of flour into a biscuit dough according to well-known 
directions; make a very soft dough; pat into shape with the hands and 
cover the pears. Bake about 25 minutes. There should be rich juice 
enough to moisten the crust. If preferred it may have plain cream 
served with it. 

Persimmon Pudding. — One quart of persimmons mashed fine with the 
hands, and every seed removed. Add one quart of sweet milk, one egg, 
one tablespoonful of butter, one-half teaspoonful each of cinnamon, nut- 
meg and ginger, and half as much of allspice and cloves, half cupful of 
sugar. Pour into a buttered baking dish, and bake till well set, as if for 
custard. Eat hot or cold ; delicious either way. 

English Plum Pudding. — ^One pound stoned raisins; one pound of 
suet, chopped fine; ^ pound of stale bread crumbs; one-fourth pound 
of brown sugar; grated rind of one lemon; J4 pound of flour; one 
pound cleaned currants; ^ nutmeg, grated; five eggs; one cup milk; 
one-half pound chopped candied peel. Mix all the dry ingredients; then 
beat the eggs, add the milk to them, pour over the other materials, and 
mix well; it will require very hard stirring, as it is stifle. Put in 
greased molds holding one quart each, cover with well-floured cloth, and 
boil for six hours. Store away, and when used boil for six hours more. 

Plum Pudding. — Fill a deep baking pan to the depth of two inches 
with seeded plums, well sugared. Dot with bits of butter and put over 
the top a thick, good light biscuit crust with holes for the steam to 
escape. Bake 40 minutes and serve with the juice from canned plums 
or cream. This is good pudding when canning is going on to use up 
the surplus juice. Seeded grapes, peaches, apples or cherries may be 
used instead of plums. 

Plum Roll.— Sift together one pint of flour, one teaspoonful of bak- 
ing powder and one-half teaspoonful of salt; rub into the prepared flour 
one tablespoonful of butter and make into soft dough with milk or 
water; roll out quite thin, sprinkle with one cup of seeded chopped rai-

sins, one-fourth of a cup of chopped citron and half a teaspoonful of 
cinnamon ; roll up and steam for 40 minutes ; serve hot, with hard sauce. 

Poor Man's Pudding. — One cupful sour milk, one cupful of mo- 
lasses, one cupful of cold water, two cupfuls Indian meal, half a cup of 
butter, one tgg, one teaspoonful of soda, one teaspoonful of cinnamon, 
one saltspoonful of salt. Beat all together thoroughly. Pour into a 
greased pudding pan and bake two hours in a moderately hot oven. 

Poverty Pudding. — Chop one cup of suet very fine; stone one cup 
of raisins; add one cup of molasses to the suet; then add milk, one 
cupful ; add one-half teaspoonful of salt, three cupfuls of sifted flour 
and one teaspoonful of cinnamon; beat hard for three minutes; add 
raisins well floured and three level teaspoonfuls of baking powder ; turn 
into a greased mold and boil three hours ; serve with hard sauce. 

Prune Sago. — After washing one-half pound of prunes put them to 
soak till well puffed out, then put them into a stewpan with enough cold 
water to cover them. Cook till soft; pass the fruit through a fine sieve, 
after stoning it. Mix with it some pearl sago that has been well boiled. 
There should be equal quantities of fruit pulp and sago. Heat up, but 
do not boil ; if too stiff thin with a little milk or water, season with 
lemon juice; it will be sweet enough for ordinary palates. Pour into a 
jelly mold and when cold turn on a glass dish. Serve with whipped 
cream or boiled custard. 

Pumpkin Custard. — One quart of hot milk, a large cup of strained 
squash or pumpkin, a teaspoonful of butter and one of salt, a cupful of 
sugar in which half a teaspoonful of cinnamon and a pinch of ginger 
have been mixed, and three eggs beaten light. Mix pumpkin and milk, 
add other ingredients, the eggs last, pour into custard cups which must 
be set in a pan of hot water. Bake until firm, about half an hour, testing 
with a knife blade. If it comes out clean they are done. Serve ice-cold. 

Queen's Pudding. — Take about a quart of good, rich, sweet milk, and 
half a pint of bread crumbs, minus the crust. Milk and bread are scalded 
together, and cooled enough to work through the colander. In this 
way the bread is worked smooth, and is thoroughly mixed with the milk. 
To this mixture are added the yolks of four eggs and the whites of two, 
about two-thirds of a cup of sugar, and one spoonful of butter. Beat 
the ingredients together very thoroughly, for the success of the pudding 
depends much on the beating. Flavor with nutmeg. Bake it in a very 
moderately hot oven, like a custard pie, which should never come to a 
boil. When baked, beat the whites of two eggs to a stiff froth and add 
three or four spoonfuls of granulated sugar for the frosting. Spread a 
good layer of jelly upon the pudding, and over this spread the frosting, 
and set in the oven till it browns, which takes but a very few minutes 
if the oven is hot. To be eaten with cream and sugar. 



66 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Raisin Steamed Pudding. — Blend a piece of butter the size of an egg 
with one cupful of sugar, to this add one beaten tgg, half a cupful of 
milk, two teaspoonfuls of baking powder, sifted with two cupfuls of 
flour, and one cupful of seeded raisins dredged in flour. Fill cups par- 
tially full with the batter and steam three-quarters of an hour. Serve 
either with boiled sauce or sweetened cream. 

Baked Raspberry Pudding.— Line a small pudding dish with rich puff 
paste and prick with a fork. Bake a light brown and set it aside until 
cold. Beat very light the whites of four eggs, add slowly one cup of 
sugar, and lastly stir in a quart of red raspberries. Heap this lightly into 
the cooked shell in the pudding dish, return to the oven and bake 15 
to 20 minutes. Have the oven just moderately hot. 

Boiled Raspberry Pudding. — Open a can of canned or preserved rasp- 
berries and drain off the liquor, saving it for sauce for the pudding. 
Make a rich biscuit dough; roll this into a sheet a half inch thick, 
spread thickly with the berries, sprinkle bits of butter over these and 
roll up the sheet of dough as you would a sheet of music. Put into a 
floured cloth and boil for three hours. Add to the raspberry liquor a 
little sugar and boil up once. Take the pudding from the cloth, lay on 
a dish and pour the steaming sauce over it. 

Red Pudding.— A pint of red currants, a pint of raspberries, and a 
pint of cold water; mix, and add sugar to taste. Thus, if a rather sour 
pudding is desired, two teacupfuls of sugar will be sufficient to sweeten 
these ingredients, but if, on the other hand, it is a sweeter pudding that 
is required, the amount of sugar must be increased correspondingly. To 
this mixture add cinnamon — two sticks, each about three inches in length 
will be sufficient — already broken into bits, and when all these ingre- 
dients have boiled together for half an hour in a porcelain-lined stew- 
pan, press the juice through a sieve into another receptacle, and, adding 
a teacupful of blanched almonds and citron that have been chopped finely 
together, cook again for another 20 minutes. When nearly done, thicken 
with cornstarch. Set aside in a wet mold until it has had time to be- 
come hard; then serve it in slices covered thickly with rich cream. 

Rice Pudding. — Have one pint of rice boiled done and still hot. Into 
this stir one cup of raisins to swell and begin cooking in the hot mass. 
When nearly cold beat together three eggs, one quart of milk, one cup 
sugar and vanilla to taste. Add the rice and raisins, stirring till smooth 
and free from lumps. This pudding will have a delicious thick custard 
on top of the layer of rice if properly made and is better than the old 
style of nearly solid pudding. Bake one hour and serve with sweet milk 

Lemon Rice Pudding.— Boil a cup of well washed rice in a quart of 
milk until very soft. Add to ii while hot the beaten yolks of three eggs, 
the juice and grated rind of two lemons, eight tablespoonfuls of sugar 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 67 

and a pinch of salt. If too thick, add a little milk. It should be rather 
thicker than boiled custard. Turn it into a pudding Crtsh, beat the 
whites of the eggs very stiff with six tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar, 
spread over the top and brown delicately in a slow oven. 

Rhubarb Cobbler. — Fill a deep, buttered, earthenware pie dish with 
rhubarb cut into pieces an inch long. Make a batter of eggs, flour, milk 
and salt, allowing a large tablespoonful of flour to each egg and milk 
enough to make a batter thick as for fritter batter. Pour this over the 
rhubarb and bake until the pudding is light and nicely browned. 

Rhubarb Puffs. — One cupful of finely chopped rhubarb, one cupful 
of sugar, two tablespoonfuls of butter creamed with the sugar, add two 
well-beaten eggs, one-quarter of a cup of milk, flour with one teaspoonful 
of baking powder well mixed into it, to make a thick batter. Fill well- 
greased cups half full and steam for half an hour. The sauce to serve 
with these puffs is made by creaming together one-half cupful of pow- 
dered sugar and a small half cupful of butter, then add by degrees one 
whipped &gg, beating until perfectly smooth. The last thing before serv- 
ing stir in three tablespoonfuls of boiling water. 

Boiled Rhubarb Pudding. — IMake three cups of flour into dough as 
for baking powder biscuit. Roll one-fourth inch thick; cover with rhu- 
barb that has been cut in inch pieces and scalded. Wipe dry before 
spreading on the crust. Sprinkle liberally with sugar and add a dash 
of nutmeg if desired. Make a roll of the dough and cook in steamer, 
or tie up in floured cloth and drop in boiling water. Cook 30 to 45 
minutes; serve with foamy sauce. 

Rhubarb Bread Pudding. — Peel the rhubarb and cut it into small 
pieces. Cover the bottom of a pudding dish with pieces of buttered 
bread. Over this put a layer of rhubarb. Pour over it a half-teaspoon- 
ful of lemon juice, and cover liberally with sugar. Add another layer of 
bread and butter, rhubarb, lemon and sugar. Repeat until the dish is 
full, covering the last layer of rhubarb with well-buttered bread crumbs. 
Cover the dish, and steam for one hour. Then remove the lid and bake 
it slowly until it is nicely browned. 

Rhubarb Tapioca. — Prepare the rhubarb as for stewing; place in a 
deep baking dish and add sugar enough to sweeten well, a little shredded 
orange peel, salt and dot with bits of butter. Add one quart of water 
to half a cupful of fine tapioca. Add a pinch of salt and cook in a 
double boiler for 15 minutes. Then pour over the rhubarb, cover the 
dish and bake half an hour. Serve with sweetened whipped cream. 

Sour Milk Pudding. — Soak four slices of stale bread in a little milk 
or water until soft. Then stir in a quart of rich, sour milk, a cupful 
of molasses, a tablespoonful of melte-d butter, a teaspoonful each of 
cloves and cinnamon, saltspoonful of salt. Bake slowly three hours. 



G8 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Steamed Pudding. — One cupful molasses, one &gg, one cupful hot 
water, one teaspoonful saleratus, one tablespoonful butter, one cupful 
raisins, stoned, a little salt, flour enough to make stiff as cake, steam 
two hours. With this pudding use the following sauce which is de- 
licious : Cream until very light one cupful of brown sugar, and nearly 
cne-half cupful butter, a little salt, and one-fourth teaspoonful of va- 
nilla. Just before serving beat in the unbeaten white of one tgg. 

Strawberry Dumplings. — They will require one egg, a cup of sweet 
milk, a tablespoonful of melted butter, a heaping teaspoonful of baking 
powder, and flour enough to make a batter that will be a trifle thicker 
than that which is commonly used for griddle cakes. Pour a little of 
this batter into buttered tins, or porcelain cups ; place a number of well- 
sweetened berries in the center and cover them with more batter; then 
steam for about half an hour. Serve with a sauce made by mashing 
some strawberries and incorporating them into an ordinary hard butter- 
and-sugar sauce. 

Strawberry Pudding. — One cup cleaned strawberries, place in an 
earthen bowl, set in steamer over a pot of cold water, place over the fire; 
while this is heating and coming to a boil make a batter of the follow- 
ing: One heaping cup of flour with two heaping teaspoonfuls of baking 
powder and one-half teaspoonful of salt; sift all together two or three 
times, then add sweet milk or water to make a soft batter that will drop 
easily from spoon. Lift the lid of steamer and drop quickly over the 
strawberries, covering them all over nicely. Steam for 40 minutes ; do 
not let the water stop boiling. This quantity makes enough pudding 
for four persons. Eat either with cream and sugar or a sauce made as 
follows: Break one egg in a dish, add one heaping tablespoonful of 
granulated sugar, beat light, then add dessertspoonful of flour and a 
pinch of salt; beat well again; then add slowly boiling water until the 
sauce is of the required thickness (about like nice cream) ; flavor to 
taste. This sauce is very nice with any kind of pudding, especially cot- 
tage pudding. 

Sweet Potato Pudding. — One quart grated raw sweet potato, one 
quart milk, three eggs, two cupfuls sugar, piece of butter the size of an 
e.gg, one-half teaspoonful of salt, cinnamon and allspice to taste. Mix 
well, put in a buttered earthen pudding dish, and bake two hours in a 
moderate oven. 

Steamed Sweet Potato Pudding. — Take two cupfuls of grated raw 
potatoes, one cupful of grated carrots, two cupfuls of currants, one 
cupful of raisins stoned and chopped, one cupful of minced suet, one cup- 
ful of sugar, one teaspoonful each of salt and soda, and flour enough 
to make a stiff batter. Place in a greased mold and steam two hours. 
Serve with boiled sauce. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 69 

Suet Pudding. — One cupful molasses, one cupful beef suet chopped 
fine, one cupful sour milk, one teaspoonful saleratus, one cupful stoned 
raisins, one-half teaspoonful salt, four cupfuls flour. Mix thoroughly. 
Put in a buttered basin in the steamer over a kettle of boiling water. 
Steam for four hours. Do not disturb while steaming; at least not for 
the first hour. 

French Tapioca Pudding. — Scald one pint of milk over hot water. 
Stir in one-third of a cup of a quick cooking tapioca, mixed with a 
few grains of salt and one-fourth a cup of sugar. Stir and cook about 
ten minutes, then add very gradually to three eggs (or two whole eggs 
and the whites of two more), beaten very light and thick. Also add a 
grating of lemon rind and a tablespoonful of butter. Turn into a tur- 
ban-shaped mold, thoroughly buttered and dusted with sugar, and bake, 
standing in a pan of water, one hour. Serve cold, turned from the 
mold and surrounded with a fruit sauce. This is a rich, yet delicate 
pudding. 

Taylor Pudding. — Stir into a cup of sweet milk a level teaspoonful 
of soda and a teaspoonful of salt. Beat into the milk a cup of Porto 
Rican molasses and stir the wet ingredients slowly into two cups of well- 
sifted flour. Beat the batter well and pour it into a greased cake tin. 
It will be about the consistency of cake batter. Bake it in a hot oven 
for about thirty or forty minutes. When it is nearly done prepare a 
liquid sauce, as follows : Put in a saucepan five tablespoonfuls of sugar 
and 10 tablespoonfuls of water. Let it boil for four minutes and then 
add three level tablespoonfuls of butter and flavor well with nutmeg. 
When the pudding is done turn it out on a platter and carry it to the 
table. Serve it cut in thick slices with the liquid sauce. 

Yorkshire Pudding. — This is a batter pudding cooked where it will 
receive the drippings from the roasting meat, and it is very good; as 
originally made it was cooked in front of an open fire, where it would 
receive drippings from the meat cooking upon a spit. About an hour 
before the roast of beef is done drain off the gravy, leaving about two 
tablespoonfuls in the dripping pan. The meat should be laid upon a rack 
over the pan, so as to raise it up. The pudding requires three eggs, one 
pint of milk, six large tablespoonfuls of flour, one-half teaspoonful of 
salt, and two dashes of pepper. Beat the eggs until light, then add the 
milk. Put the flour into a bowl, moisten it gradually with the eggs and 
milk, beat until smooth ; strain it through a sieve to avoid lumps, add the 
pepper and salt, pour it into the dripping pan and bake. Cut into squares 
or strips, and serve around the meat. 



CHAPTER VI. 



APPLES. 



Apple ! Apple ! Call for Apple ! 

Everywhere you go ! 
Closely watch the bill of fare, 
And if apple is not there, 
Then proceed at once to pare, 
Cook and landlord down with care. 

Since apples play a large part in farmhouse economy, it has been 
thought well to group recipes for their use together, rather than sepa- 
rating them in various chapters. A few other apple recipes will "be 
found, however, included among jellies and preserves, cakes and pastry. 

Baked Apples. — Pare and core cooking apples ; put in a granite pan ; 
put over them a cupful of sugar, butter the size of a walnut; cover; bake 
until almost done; take the cover off and let them brown. When apples 
are baked in a covered earthen dish or casserole flavor and appearance 
are at their best. Pare and core the apples, sprinkle them with sugar 
and a little powdered cloves and cinnamon. Add a little water, cover the 
dish, and bake a long time in a slow oven. The apples cook to a deep 
red, and are very tender and rich in flavor. Honey is a desirable addi- 
tion to baked apples. Wipe or peel the apples, and remove the core 
without running the knife clear through. Into this hollow put a bit of 
butter and a teaspoonful of honey, and bake after the ordinary manner. 

Baked Apples in Jelly. — Peel, core and quarter a quart of apples, add 
half a cupful of water and three-fourths cupful of sugar, put in a cov- 
ered earthen dish and cook three to four hours in a slow oven, when 
they should be dark red in color. Then mix with the apples a cupful 
of liquid lemon jelly, and set in a mold to harden. These baked apples 
are also very nice eaten warm without the jelly. 

Fancy Baked Apples. — Peel and core medium-sized tart apples. Put 
them in a baking dish and pour half a cup of water over them. Set in 
a hot oven, and when the apples are heated, sprinkle with enough sugar 
to coat each and bake until tender. Make a syrup of one cup of water, 
half a cup of sugar, the juice of half a lemon, and a teaspoonful of the 
grated rind. Add two tablespoonfuls of chopped raisins, two of chopped 
candied cherries, two of chopped candied pineapple, and two of chopped 
almonds, and when the sugar is dissolved set at the back of the stove and 
let cook slowly for half an hour. When the apples are done put in little 
glass saucers, taking care not to break them. Fill with the cooked 
sweets and pour the syrup over them. Serve cold with whipped cream. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 71 

Boiled Apples in Syrup. — Rub the apples clean, but do not peel, and 
stick four cloves into each. Put in earthen dish, half cover with cold 
water, and add otie cup of sugar to each pint of water. Place upon 
stove and cook until apple skins crack; remove apples, then boil down 
syrup until it is like jelly, and pour over the fruit. 

Apple Butter. — Apple butter should be made from new cider, fresh 
from the press, and not yet fermented. Fill a porcelain-lined kettle with 
cider and boil until reduced one-half. Then boil another kettleful in 
the same way, and so continue until you have sufficient quantity. To 
every four gallons of boiled cider allow a half-bushel of nice juicy 
apples, pared, cored and quartered. The cider should be boiled the day 
before you make the apple butter. Fill a very large kettle with the 
boiled cider and add as many apples as can be kept moist. Stir fre- 
quently, and when the apples are soft beat with a wooden stick until they 
arc reduced to a pulp. Cook and stir continuously until the consistency 
is that of soft marmalade and the color is a very dark brown. Have 
boiled cider at hand in case it becomes too thick, and apples if too thin. 
Twenty minutes before you take it from the fire add ground cinnamon, 
and nutmeg to taste. It requires no sugar. When cold, put into stone 
jars and cover closely. 

Apple Dumplings. — Pare, quarter and core tart apples. Put one table- 
spoonful of baking powder in one quart of flour, add one cupful of lard 
and half a teaspoonful of salt and mix with sweet milk, make stiffer than 
for biscuits, roll and cut in squares and put around the pieces of apple. 
Into a deep pudding dish put one quart of water, one cupful of sugar 
and a small lump of butter. Set it on top of the stove and let it come 
to a boil. Then put in the dumplings and bake in a brisk oven one hour. 

Apple Dumplings with Bread Dough. — Take out about a pint of bread 
dough in the morning when it is ready to go in the baking pans, more 
or less according to the size of the family; add shortening half the size 
of an egg, mix through the dough and set aside until an hour and a 
half before dinner. Then cut the dough into as many pieces as there are 
persons to serve and roll out. Pare and core good, tart apples, set one 
on each sheet of dough, putting a teaspoonful of sugar and a small lump 
of butter in the place of the cere, fold the dough about the apple, pinch- 
ing it tightly together, set them in a deep earthen dish and let rise half 
an hour; then sprinkle a tablespoonful of sugar over them and pour on 
one cupful of cold water and bake half an hour in a hot oven. It may 
be well to cover them with a greased paper to keep them from getting 
too brown or crusty. Eat warm with cream and sugar or any sauce 
preferred. Also excellent steamed. 

Boiled Apple Dumplings. — Pare eight fine apples and cut them in 
quarters, remove the cores. Roll the suet crust out half an inch thick and 



72 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

cut into round pieces. Dust each piece of apple with a little sugar and 
cinnamon and place four sections on each round of paste. Gather up 
the edges and pinch them together over the apple. When all the dump- 
lings are made, drop them into a kettle of boiling water and let them 
boil gently for an hour. Take them up on a hot dish and serve with 
plain, sweetened cream. If you want to serve the dumplings "just as 
grandmother did," sweeten the cream with "treacle." 

Kenilworth Ranch Dumplings. — Take a quart of flour, one cup of 
good lard and half-cup of butter ; rub this into the flour after it is sifted 
with one teaspoonful of baking powder; add enough milk to make a 
soft dough. This is rolled cut quickly into a sheet an inch thick and 
then cut in squares. Into each square is laid a half apple, peeled and 
cored, and the crust tucked around it. Have ready in a dripping pan 
a syrup made of one cupful of sugar to one of water ; lay the dumplings 
in; bake in quick oven 30 to 40 minutes. Serve with an old-fashioned 
molasses sauce. 

Farmhouse Apples. — Peel and core tart apples, fill the space from 
which the cores were taken with seeded raisins, bits of shredded citron, 
sugar and a little lemon peel; stand them in a baking pan, pour over 
them half a cup of water and dust with about two tablespoonfuls of 
granulated sugar. Bake in a slow oven until perfectly tender, then 
sprinkle bread crumbs over the top ; dust again with sugar, and leave 
them in the oven for 10 minutes. While they are baking mix a table- 
spoonful of flour with a half cup sugar; pour over half a pint of boiling 
water, and boil a moment ; take from the fire, and pour slowly over one 
well-beaten tgg; add the juice of half a lemon. Pour over the apples 
and serve warm. 

Apple Fool. — Peel, core and quarter six large apples, cook them until 
tender with three or four cloves, a small piece of lemon peel, half a 
cupful of sugar and a teacupful of water. Remove the cloves and lemon 
peel, beat well with a fork and stir in one-fourth pint of thick, sweet 
cream. Cut any kind of delicate cake into rather thin slices and place a 
layer in the bottom of a glass dish. Pour over it diluted red currant 
jelly, then cover with a thick layer of the apple fool, then another layer 
of cake and currant jelly, and heap the remainder of the apple fool over 
the top. With each helping serve a large spoonful of whipped cream 
flavored with almond. 

Hidden Apples. — Butter a deep tin pan, cover the bottom with a layer 
of pared and quartered apples. In another dish beat an egg well, put in 
enough sugar to sweeten the apples, add a little water, thicken with 
powdered bread crumbs, flavor highly with lemon. Pour this mixture 
over apples and bake until the apples are done, which will take about 
20 minutes in a hot oven. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 73 

Apple Johnny Cake. — Mix two cupfuls of cornmeal, a saltspoonful of 
salt, a teaspoonful of cream of tartar, a scant half-cupful of sugar, half 
a teaspoonful of soda dissolved in a little warm water and milk to make 
a thin batter. Stir in three sour apples that have been peeled and cut 
into thin slices. Bake in a shallow tin in a moderate oven for 35 minutes. 
Apple Kisses. — Select six small, smooth apples. Pare, cut in half and 
remove the core. Mix one-half a cupful of sugar with one-third cupful 
of butter. Place this mixture between the halves of the apples. Place 
in a baking dish with a little water and a teaspoonful of vanilla extract- 
Bake till apples are soft. Serve with their own juice for sauce. 

Apple Pancakes. — Measure two cupfuls of sifted flour; add half a 
teaspoonful of salt and sift again. Then stir in gradually two cupfuls of 
cold water and the beaten yolks of three or four eggs, making a per- 
fectly smooth batter. When well mixed, fold in the whites of the eggs 
beaten to a froth. Place a tablespoonful of fat in an iron frying pan 
and when hot pour in enough batter to cover the bottom of the pan 
quarter of an inch thick ; have a few nicely-flavored apples, pared, cored 
and finely minced; sprinkle a layer of the apple over the cake (not too 
much, or the pancake is liable to break). As the cake cooks, slip a 
flexible knife under it, lifting it so it will not burn, and shake the pan 
gently to and fro. When the pancake is a light brown on under side, 
slip it on to a hot plate, put a piece of butter on top of the apples, hold 
the frying pan over it and deftly turn the cake back into the pan and 
cover and cook until the apples are soft. Then slip it out of pan on to a 
hot plate; set the plate over hot water to keep the cake warm and con- 
tinue frying up remainder of the batter in same manner. Serve them 
separately or piled, one upon the other. Serve with sugar sprinkled over 
them and oranges or lemons cut in halves for squeezing over them. This 
quantity of batter should make four cakes. Do not have your pan too 
large. 

Apple Custard Pancakes. — Beat four eggs light, adding to them a half 
pint of cream and a little ground cinnamon. Peel and core the apples, 
cut them in thin slices and fry them tender in a little butter. When 
browned slightly, turn them over, pour in the custard and fry to a light 
brown. Turn out on a hot flat dish and sprinkle powdere(l sugar over 
the pancake. 

Apple Pie. — As a variation from the ordinary pie with two crusts, 
slice apples into a deep earthen pie dish, sweeten and flavor to taste, and 
cover with a top crust only. The absence of a soggy bottom crust is 
usually viewed as an advantage. 

Apple Custard Pie. — Peel and cut apples very fine. Line a deep pan 
with crust, put in the apples; scatter over them small pieces of butter 
and a covering of granulated sugar. Then pour over all a cupful of 



74 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

sweet cream and bake until the apples are cooked. Serve just before it 
is quite cold. 

Dutch Apple Pie. — Make a rich puff paste and line deep pie plate. 
Core and cut into eighths as many rich tart apples as will fill the pie 
plate by laying each piece of apple with the curved side up, just as close 
together as can be placed; over the top sprinkle half cup light brown 
sugar, half teaspoonful cinnamon and tablespoonful flour. Dot bits of 
butter over the top and add half cup water; bake slowly and carefully 
until apples are tender and water absorbed. Serve warm with cheese. 

Dried Apple Pie. — Cook a large handful of dried apples quickly in a 
tightly-covered granite basin in a little less than a quart of water. Six 
halves of dried apricots are cut fine and cooked in very little water. Fill 
in the apple, then the apricot, together with water they were cooked in; 
add a small cupful of sugar, and nutmeg, making the pie with two crusts, 
and bake quickly. 

Apple Pot-pie. — Serve this with maple-sugar sauce. Half fill a deep 
dish with sour apples which have been quartered, pared and cored. Pour 
over them a little boiling water and place in a hot oven until tender. 
Make a crust as for baking powder biscuit, roll out an inch thick; lay 
it over the apples and return to the oven for about 40 minutes or until 
the crust is done. For the sauce cook together two tablespoonfuls of 
butter and one teaspoonful of flour, add half a cupful of maple syrup 
and a tiny pinch of mace, and cook until clear and smooth. 

Apple Pudding. — Make a dough as for baking powder biscuit; roll out 
one-quarter inch thick. Peel and slice good tart apples rather thin; put 
them in the middle of the dough, put on them half a cupful of sugar, 
tablespoonful of butter, and nutmeg. Wet the edges, lap over the apples 
well to keep the juice in, put over the apples a little water, put pudding 
in a cheesecloth bag, and boil two hours steady. Eat with good cream. 

Baked Apple Pudding. — Butter a granite or enameled pie tin and fill 
it with pared and quartered Duchess apples, cut in rather thick slices. 
Cover with a thick batter made from a cup of flour, in which a teaspoon- 
ful of baking powder, a saltspoon of salt and a tablespoon of butter 
have been well mixed. Add two-thirds of a cup of sweet milk, or sour 
milk in which a quarter of a teaspoon of soda has been dissolved; wc 
prefer the sour milk. Only about half as much baking powder is 
required with the sour milk as when sweet milk is used, but we always 
use some and find that it makes the food lighter and better than where 
soda alone is used. When the pudding is done reverse it on a plate, 
spread with butter and sprinkle over it a half cup of sugar, add a few 
gratings of nutmeg. Eat with cream. 

Canadian Pudding. — One quart of quartered sour apples, one-half cup- 
ful of sugar, one-fourth cupful of water, a pinch of grated nutmeg. Bake 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 75 

these ingredients together 20 minutes in a deep pudding dish ; then remove 
and pour over the apples the following batter: One cupful of flour, one 
tablespoonful sugar, one-fourth teaspoonful salt, one beaten egg, two 
tablespoonfuls of soft butter. Return to the oven, increase the heat and 
bake for 20 minutes more. Serve with maple sauce made as follows: 
Add to one thoroughly-beaten egg one cupful of grated maple sugar, one 
cupful of whipped cream, one-half teaspoonful of vanilla. In Vermont, 
where this recipe was obtained, a bowl of grated maple sugar invariably 
accompanied most desserts. Pudding sauces were always well covered 
with it. 

Caramel Pudding. — Peel, core and slice enough sour apples to measure 
one pint. Cook them slowly in a saucepan in two tablespoonfuls of 
butter until soft; then add one cupful of sugar, one-quarter of a tea- 
spoonful of cinnamon, two tablespoonfuls of caramel and simmer for 
twenty minutes. Mix together one and one-half cupfuls of stale bread 
crumbs, one-half cupful of crumbled stale macaroons and one-half cupful 
of seedless raisins. Butter a deep dish and fill with alternate layers of 
the apples and bread mixture, having crumbs on top. Bake three-quarters 
of an hour in a rather hot oven, and serve cold with whipped cream. 

Eureka Pudding.^Put one or two quarts of boiling water in stewpan, 
add cornmeal to make a thick gruel, and teaspoonful of salt. Let it boil 
long and slowly. While cooking peel and slice five or six (more or less) 
good cooking apples ; add to gruel. Let boil tender, add sugar and boil 
longer as for apple sauce. Turn into a mold and eat hot or cold with 
cream or boiled milk. This can be improved by putting the whites of 
eggs beaten stiff into pudding before taken from the fire ; add the yolks 
to the boiled milk and serve with the pudding. 

German Pudding. — Pare, core and slice eight or 10 sour apples and 
put in a deep pudding dish, sweetening with one cupful of sugar, and 
sprinkling with a little lemon juice. Pour over them a rich egg batter, 
bake in a moderate oven one hour, and serve cold. 

Indian Apple Pudding. — Take one-half of a cup of molasses, one quart 
of milk, one teaspoonful of salt, three scant cups of pared and sliced 
apples, to which add a quarter of a teaspoonful of ginger and cinnamon. 
When the milk boils in the double boiler, pour it slowly on the meal. 
Cook half an hour in the boiler, stirring often. Now add the other 
ingredients ; pour into a deep, well-greased pudding dish and bake slowly. 
Eat with cream or maple syrup. 

Queen Apple Pudding. — Make a rich pie crust, and roll out in an 
oblong sheet. Spread with chopped apples, cinnamon, sugar and butter 
(cream the sugar and butter together for convenience in spreading), roll 
up like a jelly cake, and cut off in two-inch lengths. Stand the slices in 
a dripping pan, with a Uttle water arpund them, an4 b^e thoroughly for 



76 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

30 minutes. Very good either hot or cold. If desired it may be baked 
in the entire roll, instead of slices. 

Apple Roly-Poly.— Mix a half cupful of finely-chopped suet, one egg, 
one teaspoonful of baking powder, three-quarters of a cupful of cold 
water and a quarter of a teaspoonful of salt, with flour enough to make 
a stiff paste. Roll out the paste in a sheet about three-quarters of an 
•nch thick, brush it over with the yolk of the tgg and sprinkle with 
one tablespoonful of fine bread crumbs. Spread over it three apples 
peeled and sliced thin. Sprinkle with one-half tablespoonful of sugar 
and roll the paste. Brush the loU with egg, sprinkle it with bread crumbs 
and roll it in a napkin that has been wrung out of hot water and that 
has been covered on one side with flour. Lap the ends over securely, tie 
with a string and boil in water that has been slightly salted for an hour 
and a half. Serve with lemon sauce. 

Sour Apple Pudding. — Peel and slice several sour cooking apples into 
a pudding dish ; add sugar and water as for stewing. Cover and bake 
until nearly tender. Sift together two cupfuls of flour, three tablespoon- 
fuls of baking powder, and a scant half teaspoonful of salt. Beat one 
€^gg, mix in half a cup of sugar, two tablespoonfuls of melted butter and' 
one cupful of milk, then stir the latter into the dry ingredients. Pour the 
batter over the partly cooked apples, and bake about 20 minutes. Serve 
with whipped cream or a creamy sauce made with sugar, white of egg, 
and lump of butter, 

Apple Souffle. — Stew the apples as if for sauce, adding a little lemon 
peel and juice. Spread the stewed apples high around a baking dish. 
Make a custard of the yolks of two eggs, a pint of milk, a pinch of 
cinnamon and a tablespoonful of sugar. Let the custard cool and then 
pour it into the dish with ths apples. Beat the whites of the eggs and 
spread over the top, sprinkling with sugar, and set it in the oven to brown. 
The apples should be about an inch thick at the bottom and sides of 
the dish. 

Spiced Apples with Cider. — Boil together one cupful of cider, one- 
quarter cupful vinegar, one cupful brown sugar, one bay leaf, two tea- 
spoonfuls whole allspice, two dozen whole cloves, two inches stick cinna- 
mon, two blades mace. Pare and core eight large, tart apples, cut in 
quarters and add to the boiling syrup ; simmer gently until tender, but 
not broken. Take out the fruit carefully, boil syrup until thick as honey, 
pour over apples and serve cold. These are delicious with roast goose, 
duck or pork or any cold meat. 

Navy Apple Shortcake. — Butter thickly an oblong granite baking dish. 
Halve and core as many good cooking apples as will fit tightly in dish; 
cover thickly with sugar (about a coffee cupful), several grates of nut- 
meg and three tablespoonfuls of boiling water; make a righ shortcake

THE GENTLEMAN FROM INDIANA, By Booth 

Tarkixgtois^. This still remains the best work of this 
popular author. It has been enormously popular and still 
coulinues to make new friends. It depicts some striking 
phases in the life of a small town in the middle West, and 
contains many odd and unusual characters. 

DAVID HARUM, Bt E. N. Westcott. No other book 
of fiction in recent years has reached tlie popularity of 
David Harum. It is a story full of life and action, abound- 
ing in homely speeches, wise philosophy and subtle humor. 

THE CARDINAL'S SNUFFBOX, By Henry Harland. 
A charming story, the scene laid in a pict iresQue corner of 
Europe. The charactei's depicted are delightful, and the 
reader's sympathies will be enlisted from the start. This is 
regarded as Mr. Harland's finest work. 

THE FOUR FEATHERS, By A. E. W. Masox. The 

scene of this novel is partly laid in modern England and 

Ireland, and partly in the Soudan after the fall of Khartoum. 

There is a vivid picture of a Mahdist prison and the terrors 

/> of the desert, and a most appealing love story through it all. 

PAUL : A HERALD OF THE CROSS, By Florence M. 
KiNGSLEY. A deeply interesting story of New Testament 
times, written in a reverential and religious spirit. It 
is most instructive, yet as thrilling to the reader as a 
modern romance.

dough and roll and cover the apples; bake in a quick oven half an 
hour; loosen round the edges of the crust, turn it upside down on a hot 
platter, with a heated knife cut into squares and serve at once. 

Apple Sponge. — Beat the yolks of three eggs with half a cupful of 
powdered sugar ; flavor with lemon ; beat for about 10 minutes ; add to 
it the beaten whites of the eggs. Peel three big tender apples ; cut them 
in thin little slices-; sift half a cupful of flour with half a teaspoonful 
baking powder and mix well with the former; put it in a buttered baking 
pan and bake in moderate oven for half an hour; spread powdered sugar 
over and serve. 

Apple Puffs. — Chop four sour apples very fine, stir into them one 
beaten tgg, one- fourth cupful molasses, a cupful and a half of cornmeal, 
the same amount of sifted flour and half a teaspoonful of salt; dissolve 
half a teaspoonful of soda in warm water and add it, using enough water 
to make a thin batter. Bake in buttered cups in a quick oven. 

Royal George. — Dissolve half a teaspoonful of soda in a little warm 
water; add to a cupful of sour cream with a pinch of salt. Then add 
flour enough to make a dough stiff enough to roll out. Roll this paste 
very thin and line a deep pudding dish with it, reserving a little for the 
top. Fill the dish with tart apples, pared and quartered. Sprinkle half a 
cupful of s.ugar over them and dust with cinnamon. Cover with the rest 
of the paste, cut out in rings and diamonds, and bake until the apples 
are done. Eat hot with cream or sugar and butter beaten to a white 
cream. 

Scalloped Apples. — Pare and quarter tart apples. Put in the baking 
dish a layer of cracker crumbs, cover liberally with butter and granu- 
lated sugar. Then lay the apples with edges lapping and sprinkle chopped 
almonds over them. Then put more crumbs, butter and sugar, then 
another layer of apples, and sprinkle lightly with crumbs, butter, sugar 
and cinnamon. Bake until apples are done. Serve with rich cream. 

Red Apple Sauce. — Wash and quarter — do not pare — enough red 
apples to fill the bean pot ; sprinkle over a cupful of sugar — more or less, 
according to the size of the pot — cover and place in the oven on ironing 
day. Cook three or four hours and pour into a pretty glass dish to cool. 
The result will be a delicious surprise in the matter of rich flavor and 
dainty appearance. 

Baked Apple Sauce. — Wash and rub dry a sufficient number of Baldwin 
apples. Remove peel in long strips. Butter a beanpot and fill with the 
cored and sliced apples, packed in layers. Sprinkle each layer generously 
with sugar, and sparingly with tiny bits of butter, then cover with strips 
of peel. Repeat until the beanpot is full. Bake in a slow oven for two 
hours. Pour out, and with a fork remove the strips of peel. Serve 
heaped in sherbet glasses and topped with a spoonful of whipped cream. 



78 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Instead of the usual watery mass, you will have a rich red sauce, deli- 
cately flavored with the peel, and of about the consistency of marmalade. 

Steamed Apple Sauce. — Pare and slice the apples rather thinner than 
for sauce cooked in the usual way, dropping- into cold water as you slice 
them. Drain, turn into the inner vessel of a double boiler, and fit on the 
cover. Fill the outer kettle with warm water and bring to a steady boil. 
Keep this up for half an hour after the boil begins, then lift the lid and 
beat the soft apple to a mush with a spoon. Close and cook 15 minutes 
longer. Run through a colander or a vegetable press, sweeten to taste 
while hot, and set away to cool. 

Apple Slump. — INfake a thin apple sauce, sweeten and flavor with nut- 
meg; have about two quarts when done. Take pint flour, mix as for 
biscuit dough, drop the dough by small spoonfuls into the boiling sauce, 
after they have risen and got set turn over. When done take dumplings 
out in a deep dish and pour sauce over them; serve hot. 

Apple Butter Without Cider. — Procure a new 50-pound lard can, eight 
pounds light brown sugar. Peel and slice the apples. Then commence 
to fill the can, first a layer of apples, then a layer of sugar, and so on 
until the can is full. Cover tightly and let it stand 12 hours. Place on 
stove and when it begins to boil set it back on the stove until it simmers, 
or boils gently. Do not take ofT lid for five hours. Then remove and 
put in ground cloves and cinnamon to suit your taste. 

Suet Apple Dumplings. — One cup of chopped suet, two cups of flour, 
one teaspoonful of salt, mix with cold water into a dough ; put the apples 
in as for pudding; tie in little cloths; drop into boiling water; boil one 
hour. Use any sauce, or sugar only. 



CHAPTER VII. 

BREAD AND MUFFINS. 

Here is the recipe for making good bread, given by the great milling 
companies and used by food demonstrators : To one quart of lukewarm 
liquid — half water and half milk, or water alone — add two half-oance 
compressed yeast cakes, or the usual quantity of liquid yeast, and stir 
until dissolved. Add one teaspoonful of salt and three tablespoonfuls 
of sugar, and when well dissolved stir in with wooden spoon three quarts 
of well-sifted flour, or until dough is sufficiently stiff to be turned from 
the mixing bowl to the molding board in a mass. If shortening is desired 
add two tablespoonfuls lard. Knead this dough, adding if necessary 
from time to time, flour until it becomes smooth and elastic and ceases 
to stick to fingers or board. Do not make dough too stiff. Spring wheat 
flour needs a little more working than Winter wheat, and should be a 
little softer to make it rise properly. Put dough into well-greased 
earthen bowl, brush lightly with melted butter or drippings, cover with 
towel and set in warm place, about 75 degrees, for two hours, or until 
light, then knead well and return to bowl, cover as before and set for 
another hour's rising, or until light. When light, form gently into loaves 
or rolls, place in greased bread pans, brush with butter or drippings, 
cover again and let stand for one and one-half hour, then bake. When 
bread becomes stale it may be made palatable again and as good as 
new, or even better than new, by wetting the old loaf with cold water, 
putting in the pan and rebaking it in the oven 20 to 45 minutes. It will, 
if originally good, come out moist and fresh. 

Boston Brown Bread. — Two cupfuls Indian meal ; one cupful whole 
wheat flour; one cupful sour milk; one-third cupful molasses; one tea- 
spoonful soda ; one-half teaspoonful salt. Mix and steam three hours, 
then brown m hot oven with the lid removed from the can. There are 
tin molds made smaller at the bottom than the top, so the loaf slips out 
nicely — the lid fitting on the outside of the tin to prevent the water 
getting in the bread, but any small tin pail with tight lid will answer 
the purpose. It is better to place an iron lid or ring in the bottom of 
the kettle to prevent the mold from coming too close to the fire. Slice 
around the loaf, not perpendicularly. 

Easy Brown Bread. — For one loaf take one cup of sour milk, one cup 
of sweet milk, one teaspoon of salt, one-half cup of molasses with one 
teaspoon of soda thoroughly stirred in; add one-half cup of white flour 
and about three cups oi graham flour. Mix so stiff that a little dough 



80 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

dropped from the spoon will not quickly settle. Put in a deep bread 
pan and bake in a moderately hot oven for one hour. If not stiff enough, 
the top crust may separate from the rest of the loaf. 

Entire Wheat Bread. — ^One pint milk, scalded and cooled, one table- 
spoonful sugar, one teaspoonful salt, one-half cupful yeast, about five 
or six cupfuls whole wheat flour. In the morning mix in the order 
given, and knead until smooth and elastic. Let rise till light, allow it 
to rise a little longer, and then bake a little longer, and in an oven not 
quite so hot, as for white bread. Whole-wheat bread rises more than 
white bread, because the flour contains more gluten. Sometimes we 
make a sponge with white flour, in the same proportion as for ordinary 
bread, and then thicken and knead with the entire wheat flour. 

Light Bread. — Into two quarts of wheat flour stir a teaspoonful of 
granulated sugar and a half teaspoonful of salt, and sift into a large 
bowl. Bring to the scalding-point two cups of milk; stir into this a 
generous teaspoonful of butter, and, when this melts, add two cups of 
boiling water. Remove from the fire and set aside until blood-warm, 
then stir in a gill of water of the same temperature, in which a half- 
cake of compressed yeast has been thoroughly dissolved. Make a hollow 
in the centre of the sifted flour and pour in the liquid. Stir to a soft 
dough, then turn upon a floured board and knead for 15 minutes ; set in 
a bread raiser in a warm place for six hours or until light. Make into 
three loaves of uniform size, knead each of these for at least five min- 
utes, put into a baking-pan, cover with a cloth, and set to rise until very 
light. Bake in a steady oven. 

Oatmeal Brown Bread. — Mix in a large bowl one pint of Quaker 
oats, a rounding teaspoonful of salt, a pint of Pettijohn's breakfast 
food, half a pint of whole wheat flour and half a pint of yellow gran- 
ulated cornmeal. Put into another bowl one pint of thick sour milk and 
half a pint of molasses. Dissolve a level teaspoonful of bicarbonate 
of soda in two tablespoonfuls of warm water; add this to the molasses 
and sour milk; stir until foaming; then add it to the dry ingredients 
and mix until every grain is moistened. Turn into a greased mold and 
boil or steam continuously for four hours. Stand in a moderate oven 
for 30 minutes. It will then be ready to use. This may be toasted on 
the second day, or warmed over in the oven, or it may be used cold. 
Toasted it makes an acceptable breakfast bread. 

Scotch Oat Bread. — To two cups of steel-cut oatmeal, one teaspoon- 
ful soda and one teaspoonful salt, add two cups of boiling water; when 
cool add one cup of molasses and one cake of yeast. Stand over night. 
In the morning mix stiff with wheat flour. Shape into loaves, let rise 
and bake. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 81 

Salt-Rising Bread. — Dissolve a half teaspoonful of salt in two cups 
of scalding water, and beat in gradual!}^ enough flour to make a very 
soft dough. Beat for 10 minutes, cover and set in a very warm place 
for eight hours. Now stir a teaspoonful of salt into a pint of lukewarm 
m.ilk and add enough flour to make a stiff batter before working it into 
the risen dough. Mix thoroughly, cover and set again in a warm place 
to rise until very light. Turn into a wooden bowl and knead in enough 
flour to make the batter of the consistency of ordinary bread dough. 
Make into loaves and set these to rise, and when light, bake. 

Sour Milk Corn Bread. — Mix together in a bowl three cupfuls of 
corn meal and one cupful of graham flour. Stir in a teaspoonful of 
salt, a tablcspoonful of melted butter, and two cupfuls of sour milk. 
Now beat in three eggs, whipped light, and a small teaspoonful of soda 
dissolved in a little boiling water. Beat for five minutes, then pour into 
a greased mold with a funnel in the center. Bake for an hour, or until 
a straw comes out clear from the thickest part of the loaf. 

Spoon Corn Bread. — Put a quart of milk, or half milk and half water, 
in a double boiler. Add four large kitchen spoonfuls of white cornmeal, 
and stir and cook five minutes. Remove from the fire and let it cool, 
stirring it once or twice as it cools. Then add two or three eggs beaten 
with two tablespoonfuls of wheat flour, one tablespoonful of butter and 
a scant teaspoonful of salt. Mix well, then pour into a greased baking 
dish, and bake 35 minutes. Serve immediately in dish in which it is 
baked, with a folded napkin wrapped around the dish. 

Susan's Cornbread. — One cup white flour, one-half cup yellow corn- 
meal, one-half teaspoonful salt, one tablespoonful sugar, two teaspoon- 
fuls baking powder. Sift dry ingredients, then mix with one beaten 
tgg and enough sweet milk to make a thin batter, stirring in at the 
last a piece of butter the size of a walnut melted. Pour into a well- 
greased shallow pan and bake in a quick oven. 

Crackling Bread. — One quart of cornmeal^three pints make more 
dough — a pint of buttermilk, a teaspoonful of soda, a big pinch of salt, 
a pint of brown cracklings left from making lard, warm water. Crush 
the cracklings with a rolling pin, heat them and stir in the dough, 
which must be thick enough to mold well (thin with the warm water). 
Mold the bread with the hands in small oblong pones about three inches 
thick, putting the pones as you mold them in hot, well-greased pans. 
Bake in a hot oven until brown. 

Crumb-loaf. — Beat two eggs with a pinch of salt added; add a cupful 
of sweet milk and a quarter of a cupful of sugar. Stir in enough 
bread crumbs to make a medium thick batter, then add flour enough to 
thicken like corn bread. Sift a teaspoonful of baking powder in with

the flour. Bake to a rich, crisp brown and serve hot. Fine for either 
breakfast or supper. 

Egg Bread. — Two eggs, one pint of buttermilk, three pints of corn- 
meal, one-half pint of lard, one teaspoonful of soda, a pinch of salt, sweet 
milk or sweet cream. Stir the soda in the buttermilk until it boils up, 
mix the bread quickly, adding a sufficient quantity of sweet milk or 
sweet cream to make a rather thin batter; beat in the eggs, and add 
the lard, m.elted and hot, last. Pour quickly into frying hot greased 
baking pans and bake quickly to a delicate brown. This bread will be a 
golden yellow and as light as cake. 

Swedish Breakfast Bread. — Add one-third cup butter, one-fourth cup 
sugar, and one-half teaspoon salt to one cup scalded milk. When luke- 
warm, add one-third yeast-cake dissolved in one-fourth cup lukewarm 
milk, one ^gg„ well beaten, one-half cup raisins, stoned and cut in pieces, 
and flour to make a stiff batter. Cover and let rise over night; in morn- 
ing cut down and spread in buttered dripping-pan, one-half inch thick. 
Cover and let rise again. Before baking brush over with beaten egg and 
cover with the following mixture : Melt three tablespoons butter, add 
one-third cup sugar, and one teaspoon cinnamon. When sugar is par- 
tially melted, add three tablespoons flour. Bake in a moderate oven, and 
cut in squares for serving. 

Beaten Biscuits. — One quart of sifted flour, one tablespoonful of 
lard, one-half pint cold water. Put the flour and salt in a bowl, rub the 
lard in with the hands, add the water gradually. Work and knead until 
smooth and elastic. Then put the dough on a block and pound it with 
a mallet, rolling pin or ax for one hour until full of bubbles. The old- 
fashioned rule was to "hit it 500 licks." Form into small round cakes, 
stick with a fork here and there, and bake in a moderately quick oven 
about 20 minutes. They should be brown on top, white on the sides, 
and extremely white inside. 

Bread-crumb Biscuits. — Take one quart each of bread crumbs and 
sour milk, add one-half cupful of lard, one-half teaspoonful of salt, and 
stiffen with flour in which is put before sifting one teaspoonful each of 
saleratus and baking powder. Mold, and bake in a quick oven. Be 
sure to allow the crumbs to soak for an hour in the milk before adding 
the other ingredients. 

Buttermilk Biscuits. — Two coffeecupfuls (even) of flour, half a cof- 
feecupful of sour milk, half a coffeecupful of buttermilk, one teaspoonful 
of sugar, one teaspoonful of yeast powder, half a teaspoonful of salt, 
half a teaspoonful of soda. Mix sugar, yeast powder and salt with 
flour and sift; dissolve soda in two tablespoonfuls of cold water, beat 
into the sour milk until it stops "purring," mix quickly with dry ingre- 
dients, using a spoon, turn on a well-floured board, pat with the hand 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 83 

into a cake half an inch thick, roll, cut into biscuits; bake in a very 
hot oven 10 minutes. 

French Biscuits.— One cupful of butter, one cupful of sugar, the stif- 
fly-beaten v^^hite of one ^gg, one-fourth cupful of thick sour milk, half 
a teaspoonful of soda dissolved in a very little hot water, flour enough 
to make a dough that may be rolled out. Sprinkle with sugar, cut into 
large circles, and bake for 20 minutes. 

jNIartha Washington Biscuits. — Sift one pint of flour with one table- 
spoonful of sugar, one teaspoonful each of baking powder and salt. Rub 
into it one tablespoonful of lard. Mix with one well-beaten egg and one 
cupful of water ; roll one-fourth of an inch in thickness and cut with 
small round cutter. Fry in hot fat until cooked on one side, turn and 
brown. 

Molded Biscuits. — One quart of flour, into which two heaping tea- 
spoonfuls of baking powder and one of salt have been sifted; rub into 
it a scant half cupful of lard and butter, half and half; stir to a dough 
with enough milk to make it just too thin to roll out. Grease muffin 
rings and put on a greased baking pan ; drop from a spoon dough enough 
nearly to fill each ring ; bake in a quick oven. Delicious tea cake, to be 
eaten hot with butter, is made by adding a tablespoonful of sugar and one 
well-beaten egg to this recipe and baking in one loaf, or in a large flat 
cake to be split open and buttered, then cut in sections. 

Potato Biscuits. — Pare and boil six white potatoes. While hot put 
through a ricer, then add gradually one pint of scalded milk, one-half of 
a cupful of butter, one teaspoonful each of salt and sugar and one-half 
of a cupful of flour. Let stand until lukewarm, then add one yeast cake 
dissolved in a little warm water and sifted flour to make a soft dough. 
Knead lightly, using no more flour than is needed to keep from sticking 
to the board. Cover and let stand again until very light, then form 
into small rolls, handling most carefully and greasing the hands if the 
dough is inclined to stick. Place in greased pans, let stand until fully 
doubled in bulk, then bake about twenty minutes in a quick oven. 

Sour Cream Biscuits. — Use three good tablespoonfuls of thick sour 
cream; put this into a quart measure and fill it two-thirds full with 
sweet milk; add half a teaspoonful of salt, two teaspoonfuls of cream 
of tartar and a teaspoonful of soda. Stir into this enough flour to make 
a dough that will roll very soft; cut into small biscuits, brush well with 
melted butter, and bake about 20 minutes in a good oven. 

Tea Biscuits. — For a six o'clock tea, set the batter about one o'clock. 
Add to one quart sifted flour a teaspoonful sugar, a heaping teaspoonful 
salt, and a tablespoonful each lard and butter ; rub in well ; dissolve one- 
half yeast cake (compressed) in a little tepid water; add to a cupful 
sweet milk; then mix well with the flour; cover and set out of a draught

to rise; when light turn out on the molding board, sprinkle with a very 
little flour and roll out to the thickness of half an inch; cut out with 
two sizes of round cutters, placing the smaller ones on top of the 
larger, with a brushing of melted butter between ; let stand about an 
hour to rise, then bake. The oven does not need to be as hot as for 
baking powder biscuit. 

Sugared Biscuits. — Ordinary biscuit dough is made, 'rolled out as for 
cutting, and then lightly spread with butter and sugar, creamed together. 
The dough is then rolled up like a jelly roll, and cut into slices like cin- 
namon buns, each biscuit being sprinkled on top with a little more 
butter and sugar. 

Yarmouth Biscuit. — Mix three-quarters of a pound of sifted flour, 
one-half pound of sugar and one-half pound of currants to a paste with 
half a poimd of butter and three eggs. Roll out to one-eighth of an 
inch in thickness and bake a light brown in quick oven. 

Brioche. — This is one of the delicate breads that delight visitors in 
France. One-half pound flour, one tgg, one teaspoon sugar, two ounces 
butter, one- half teaspoon salt, one-quarter pint milk, one ounce yeast. 
Sift the flour. Heat milk lukewarm and dissolve in it the butter and 
yeast. Add the ^gg, well beaten, and the salt and sugar. Then stir 
in the flour, gradually working it all the time with your hand. Beat 
mixture well for 10 minutes, till the dough almost stops sticking to 
your fingers. Cover with a cloth and set in a warm place to rise. When 
four times its original size turn it on a floured board and take pieces 
about the size of a turkey's egg and form into fancy shapes, twists, 
knots, etc. Put in a buttered tin and let rise 15 minutes. When risen, 
brush over lightly with the egg beaten up. Bake in quick oven 20 min- 
utes. 

Buckwheat Cake. — This is an old Canadian recipe and very good. 
Make batter as for buckwheat pancakes, only a trifle thicker, and bake 
in well-greased shallow pan, like corn bread. There should be a delicious 
brown crust on the bottom. The prepared flour can be used. 

Breakfast Buns. — Scald one-half pint of milk; pour it over two table- 
spoonfuls of sugar; one quart of lukewarm water; when milk is luke- 
warm add the yeast and enough flour to make a "sponge." Let rise until 
it doubles its original bulk, about two hours; then cream together half 
a cupful of butter and half a cupful of sugar; add two well-beaten 
eggs and one cupful of scalded milk. Mix this into the sponge and 
add sufficient flour to make a soft dough; knead lightly, cover and set 
to rise until very light ; then mold into small buns and lay in greased 
pans, allowing plenty of room to rise; then bake in a quick oven for 15 
or 20 minutes. They must not be heavy and doughy. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. ' 85 

Hot Cross Buns. — Beat a quarter cup of butter to a cream ; add four 
tablespoonfuls of sugar and then add gradually a pint of milk that has 
been scalded and cooled; add a yeast cake, dissolved, and sufficient flour 
to make a batter. Beat thoroughly. Stand in a warm place for about 
three hours. Then add four eggs well beaten and flour enough to make 
a soft dough. Knead carefully. Stand aside until very light and form 
into buns. Cut them in the center; brush them with sugar and white of 
tgg and bake in a quick oven. 

German Coff^ee Cake. — Take enough dough after it is mixed for one 
loaf and add one Qgg, shortening half the size of an ^gg and one-half 
cupful of sugar. Mix thoroughly through the dough and add flour 
enough to roll out an inch thick ; let rise and wet the top of it with 
cold water, sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon, and bake. To be cut 
in slices and eaten with or without butter for breakfast with coffee and 
put up for the children's school lunches in place of so much rich cake. 
For variety roll the dough quite thin and sprinkle it with currants well 
cleansed and dates or figs cut in small bits ; then roll up tightly and 
with a sharp knife cut into slices one-half inch thick, lay in greased 
pans, let rise and bake in moderate heat. 

Fastnachts. — Mix to a light sponge the following ingredients : Three- 
fourths quart of warm milk, one-half pound of sifted flour, four ounces 
of melted butter, one ounce of yeast, one-half cupful of sugar, one egg, 
one-half pound of warmed currants, the grated rind of a lemon, one 
teaspoonful of cinnamon. Set in a warm place to rise, when light add 
enough flour to mold into biscuits, place them on baking tins and let 
rise once more, then rub over the top with a brush dipped in a well- 
beaten tgg. Bake in a hot oven. Many prefer to serve them warm 
with butter. 

Bran Gems. — Beat two eggs very light, add half a teaspoonful of salt, 
a tablespoonful of brown sugar and one and one-half cupfuls of milk, 
then stir in a pint of finely ground bran. Fill oiled gem pans half full 
and bake in a hot oven 20 minutes. These gems are advised in some 
forms of indigestion, where fine flour is objectionable. 

Corn Gems. — Sift together one pint of cornmeal, one pint of flour and 
two teaspoonfuls of baking powder. Add one-third of a pint each of 
milk and water. Mix into a firm batter and fill greased gem pans two- 
thirds full. 

Entire Wheat Gems. — Three cupfuls- entire wheat flour or wheat 
meal, two cupfuls cold water, half cupful of milk. Heat gem pans very 
hot on the top of the stove, fill them even full of the batter, place on the 
grate of a very hot oven. Let them remain 10 minutes on the grate, 
then bake 30 minutes on the bottom of the oven. They are nearly %s 



86 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

good if 2^ cupfitls of water and no milk is used. Do not use any salt, 
or they will not be so light. 

Puff Gems. — Beat very light one egg, then add to it one-quarter cup- 
ful sugar, two tablespoon fuls of melted butter, one cupfuF of sour milk. 
Beat all well. Then add one cupful of cornmeal and one cupful of 
white flour into which has been well mixed one heaping teaspoonful of 
baking powder. Lastly dissolve one-quarter teaspoonful of soda in one 
tablespoonful of boiling water, add, beat well and pour in gem pans, and 
bake 20 minutes in a hot oven. 

Golden Johnny Cake. — Heat to scalding point one pint of sweet milk; 
while hot stir into it one teaspoonful butter, one teaspoonful white su- 
gar and three-fourths of a cupful of steamed squash out of which all 
water has been pressed. Sift together two cupfuls cornmeal, one cup- 
ful flour, two heaping teaspoonfuls baking powder and a scant tea- 
spoonful salt. Add to this, gradually, the milk and squash, as soon as It 
IS lukewarm. Bake in one greased pan, or in gem pans if preferred. If 
it seems stiff a little more milk may be added. Bake in a quick oven. 
Meal varies so that it is hard to give the exact quantity. 

Oatmeal Gems, — Separate two eggs ; beat the yolks for a moment ; add 
a half pint of milk, then one and one-half cup of bread flour, and beat 
thoroughly; add a tablespoonful of melted butter, a half-teaspoonful of 
salt, one cup of left-over oatmeal porridge and one rounding teaspoonful 
of baking powder. Beat for about two minutes. Fold in carefully the 
well-beaten whites of the eggs. Pour this mixture into 12 greased gem 
pans and bake in a moderately quick oven 20 minutes. 

Popovers. — To make them without baking powder beat three eggs 
until very light, then add two cupfuls of sweet milk and one-half tea- 
spoonful of salt. Stir in four cupfuls of flour, and see that the batter 
is very smooth; then add one additional cupful of milk and a piece 
of butter the size of an egg, melted. Heat the pop-over irons or cups, 
and when they are very hot nearly fill with the batter. Bake in a 
quick oven for half an hour. To make pop-overs with baking powder re- 
quires one G^gg, well beaten, one large spoonful of melted butter, two 
tablespoonfuls of sugar, one cupful of sweet milk, 1^ cupful of flour, 
salt, and one-fourth teaspoonful of baking powder. 

Popovers Without Eggs. — One cup of milk, one cup of water, no salt 
and no baking powder. The gem pans are heated, a piece of butter the 
size of a walnut being put to melt in each little pan while the batter is 
beaten up. The oven must be good, with steady heat, and the door 
must not be opened for 25 minutes after the popovers are put in, or 
they will fall. Salt will prevent them from rising, but if made accord- 
ing to directions, they will be very light, f\9-\ix f-nou^h for drop batter. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 87 

Breakfast Rolls. — Three cups of sweet milk, one cup of butter or 
lard ; dissolve one yeast cake in a cup of warm water, mix with flour 
enough to make dough. Let rise over night, in the morning add one 
egg, knead thoroughly, let rise again, and when light make out in rolls. 
Flace in pans, keep warm, and bake when very light. 

Buttermilk Muffins. — A quart of fresh buttermilk, one teaspoonful of 
soda, a pinch of salt and enough flour to make a stiflf batter and two 
or three tablespoonfuls of sour cream. Dissolve the soda in a little 
of the buttermilk, then add to the rest; add salt and cream and the 
flour. Bake in gem pans in a hot oven. 

Bread Sponge Muffins. — Late in the evenmg set a sponge as for 
water bread, allowing a pint of warm water for a dozen muffins, a 
third of a cake of compressed yeast and a pinch of "salt. Mix the bat- 
ter a little thicker than for pancakes and beat thoroughly. In the 
morning have gem pans greased, and in cold weather warm them; pour 
in the batter without stirring, filling half full ; let them rise at least an 
hour and bake in a hot oven. 

Cape Cod Muffins. — Sift two cupfuls of flour with two teaspoonfuK 
of baking powder, a half-teaspoonful of salt and one rounded teaspoonful 
of sugar. Beat three eggs without separating; add to them i]^ cupful 
of milk and stir the milk and eggs into the flour. Have ready a cupful 
of carefully-cleaned blueberries and stir them lightly into the mixture. 
Bake in hot buttered gem pans in a quick oven for 15 minutes. 

Cream of Wheat Muffins. — Add to two cupfuls of cooked cream of 
wheat, a cupful of milk and work it smooth, then two eggs well beaten 
and a tablespoonful of sugar; to a pint of flour add two small tea- 
spoonfuls of baking powder, and a half teaspoonful of salt, rub into the 
flour a tablespoonful lard or butter; add to these ingredients the wheat 
that has been mixed with the milk and eggs. Butter muffin pans, fill them 
two-thirds full, and bake in a hot oven 20 minutes. 

Crumb Muffins. — Scraps of stale bread, toasted in the oven until 
crisp, find many uses. We run them through the food chopper until fine 
enough for use. If these crumbs are sifted, the fine particles will be 
found very nice for muffins and griddle cakes. For muffins, use one 
egg, one tablespoonful of butter, one teaspoonful of sugar and half that 
of baking powder, two cupfuls of the crumbs and one of flour; mix 
with water or sweet milk and bake slowly in gem pans. For griddle 
cakes use two cupfuls of crumbs to one of self-raising buckwheat flour. 

English Muffins. — Dissolve half of a compressed yeast cake in six 
tablespoonfuls of lukewarm water. Have a pint of milk scalding hot 
and stir into it a heaping teaspoonful of lard. Boil until the lard is dis- 
solved, then take from the fire and, when the milk is blood warm, stir it 



88 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

gradually into a pint of flour that has been sifted with two saltspoonfuls 
of salt. When the milk is all worked in, add the dissolved yeast cake, 
and blend thoroughly. Turn the batter into a bread raiser and set to 
rise in a moderately warm room for six or eight hours, or until light. 
When light, turn the mass- out upon a floured pastry board and break 
off bits of the dough, having them of uniform size, and each about as 
large as an ordinary tea biscuit. Handle very lightl}^, and roll each 
muffin in flour. Have, a soaps.tone griddle thoroughly heated and lay 
these muffins upon it. Bake them without touching until they swell to 
twice their original size. When brown on tbe under side lift carefully 
and turn. When the other side is baked to a delicate brown, the muf- 
fins are done. When ready to use, tear them open, toast and butter 
generously. 

Parker House Rolls. — Scald one pint of milk with a piece of butter 
the size of an ^gg added. Put the milk into a bread pan with one table- 
spoon of sugar and one teaspoon of salt. When the milk has cooled a 
trifle, sift in sufficient flour to make a stiff batter. Now add one cake 
of yeast and beat well, then add flour to make a soft loaf and knead 
thoroughly. Let it stand over night. In the morning, little kneading is 
required. Roll out this and cut with a biscuit-cutter. Brush over with 
melted butter, lap one-half over the other, put in a pan not too close 
together, and when very light, bake in a quick oven. 

Quick Cinnamon Rolls. — Sift together two cups of flour, two teaspoon- 
fuls of baking powder and a half teaspoonful of salt. Into this rub 
one tablespoonful of butter. Mix with milk to make a soft dough. Roll 
out to half an inch in thickness, spread with warmed butter and sprinkle 
with two tablespoonfuls of brown sugar, one teaspoonful of cinnamon 
and scatter over one-half cup of seeded raisins. Roll up as for jelly 
cake and cut into inch slices ; place so as they will touch in a pan and 
bake in a quick oven. 

Scotch Scones. — Take two pounds of fine oatmeal, a tablespoonful 
of salt, a tablespoonful of lard and enough water to make a stiff dough. 
Rub the lard into the oatmeal and add the salt and water. In rolling 
the palm of the hand should be used instead of a rollirig-pin. Press the 
dough into a round cake about a quarter of an inch thick, cut into seg- 
ments and cook on a griddle over a slow fire until a light brown. Oat- 
meal scones properly prepared will keep for weeks. 

Boston Tea Cakes. — Beat two eggs in a teacup, fill the cup with sweet 
milk, turn into a bowl with one cupful of sugar, 10 even teaspoonfuls of 
melted butter, 1^ cupful of flour and two teaspoonfuls of baking pow- 
der. This is the most reliable, easily made and accommodating of cakes. 
Delicious baked in layers and spread with jam or cream. May be baked 
in a loaf or small patty pans. Serve warm with tea. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 89 

English Tea Cake. — Sift four cupfuls of dried flour into a bowl and 
chop into it a scant cupful of butter. Dissolve half a yeast cake in four 
tablespoonfuls of warm water and stir it into two cupfuls of milk, or 
enough to make a soft dough. Roll this out into a sheet and cut into 
cakes as large as a tea plate and less than half an inch thick. Set them, 
covered lightly, in a warm place until they have nearly trebled in thick- 
ness. Bake in a floured pan. Keep them covered for 20 minutes, then 
brown. Run a sharp knife around the edge, tear the cake open, butter 
and serve upon a plate lined and covered with a heated napkin. 

Zimmet-Kuchen. — Two cupfuls of bread sponge, one egg, half a cup- 
ful of sugar, butter the size of a walnut, one cupful of warm water. 
Mix these ingredients together and make a dough not quite as stiff as 
for bread. Let it rise well, roll out one-half inch thick, let it rise again 
until quite light. Spread the dough thinly and evenly in a long shallow 
tin. Cover with an tg^ beaten with a tablespoonful of sugar and 
sprinkle liberally with powdered cinnamon and granulated sugar. The 
ingredients on the kuchen will melt and run together into a delicious can 
died top. Serve by cutting into strips one inch wide. 

Butter Cakes. — Sift two cupfuls of floor with three teaspoonfuls of 
baking powder and a half teaspoonful of salt. Rub in two tablespoonfuls 
of butter and add gradually three-fourths of a cupful of milk. Toss 
upon a well-floured board and roll out as thick as though you were 
making biscuit, then cut into rounds with a small biscuit cutter and bake 
upon a hot, well-greased griddle. Cook slowly until they puff up double 
their size, then turn and bake on the other side. Set them in a moderate 
oven for a few minutes before serving, then break them open and serve 
with butter and maple syrup. 

Waffles. — For the batter use one pint of sifted flour, one level tea- 
spoonful baking powder, one-half teaspoonful salt, one tablespoonful but- 
ter, melted, two eggs and 1^ cupful milk; beat to a smooth batter. ^ Heat 
the waffle iron very hot; grease both lids; put a cooking spoonful of 
batter into each lid, and cook five minutes on each side. Slip out on to a 
hot dish. Place in the oven until more are cooked, then put them one 
on top of the other, each buttered and heaped with grated maple sugar. 



CHAPTER VTII. 

CAKES. 

"Breathes there a man with soul so dead 
He loves not new-baked ginger bread? 
Who, stepping through the liitchen door, 
On baking day sees goodly store 
Of fragrant amber-shadowed cake, 
And, half-unconscious, does not break 
A ragged chunk ! Ah, toothsome bliss ! 
He is a churl who knows not this." 

To get a fine grained cake, beat thoroughly after the flour is added. 
Sweet milk makes cake that cuts like pound cake. Sour milk makes 
spongy, light cake. Always sift flour before measuring, then it may be 
sifted again with the baking powder to insure their being thoroughly 
blended. In making fruit cakes add the fruit before putting in the flour, 
as this will prevent it falling to the bottom of the cake. Flouring "the 
fruit is unnecessary, unless the fruit is damp. If a cake cracks open 
while baking, the recipe contains too much flour. In creaming butter 
and sugar, when the butter is too hard to blend easily, warm the bowl 
and if necessary warm the sugar, but never warm the butter, as this will 
change both texture and flavor of the cake. The smaller the cake the 
hotter should be the oven. Large rich cakes require very slow baking. 
Grease cake pans with lard or drippings, as butter will be likely to make 
the cake stick, owing to the salt in it. 

When eggs are short in the Winter snow may be used as a substitute; 
one of The R. N.-Y. housewives says that one cupful of snow, beaten in 
after all the ingredients are put together, is equal to two eggs. 

Almond Cookies. — Cream together one-half cupful of butter and two 
cupfuls sugar. Stir in alternately a little at a time one cupful of sweet 
milk and twice sifted flour to make a dough which can be handled. With 
the last of the flour sift in two teaspoonfuls of baking powder; roll out 
one-quarter inch thick; before cutting out sprinkle with a cup of almonds 
which have been blanched and chopped and a teaspoon of granulated 
sugar mixed through them. Bake in quick oven. These should be eaten 
fresh, as should all cakes made without the addition of eggs. 

Angel Cake. — Four ounces and a heaping tablespoonful of flour, 12 
ounces of powdered sugar, the whites of 11 eggs beaten to a very stiff 
froth (flavor with rose before beating), a teaspoonful of cream of tartar 
and a little salt. Mix the sugar, flour, salt and cream of tartar together 
and sift through a very fine sieve six times. Then stir in lightly the 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 91 

beaten whites. Bake in a neiv pan, without greasing, for 40 minutes. 
After taking from the oven, invert the pan and place upon cups or 
tumblers until the cake is cold, then remove and cover with a thin icing. 
No soda is used. A pan with a tin tube in the center is preferable for 
baking. 

Angel Cake No. 2. — Take the whites of nine large eggs. Add to 
them a pinch of salt and whip them lightly until they are partly stiff, 
then add half a teaspoonful of cream of tartar and whip them until very 
stifif. Fold in carefully one and one-fourth cupful of granulated sugar 
that has been sifted three times. Sift one cupful of the best pastry 
flour seven times (if you want a perfect cake), and fold it into the 
sugar and whipped eggs lightly. Last of all, add a teaspoonful of 
vanilla. Turn the cake into a large, unbuttered pan. Bake in a moderate 
even from 35 to 50 minutes. Never open the oven door until you think 
the cake is done, as it falls very easily. On taking it from the oven 
turn it upside down in such a way that current of air will pass under 
it until it is cold. When cold loosen the cake from the sides of the pan 
and lift it out. It should be so delicately baked that this will not be 
difficult. If you intend to ice it cover it with a soft uncooked icing 
made with powdered sugar, white of tgg and a very little vanilla. 
Angel cake is generally better for being kept a day before serving. If it 
is a little tough place it in a stone jar and cover with a plate. Let it 
stand for two or three days in this way and it will become tender. 

Apple Cake. — Measure two cupfuls of sifted flour, add two teaspoon- 
fuls of baking powder and half a teaspoonful of salt and sift again into 
a mixing bowl; make a well in the center; beat whites of two and yolk 
of one egg until light, add grated rind of a lemon, one tablespoonful of 
melted butter and a cupful of milk; mix this gradually into the flour 
until you have a thick batter or very soft dough. Spread this on shallow, 
well-buttered tins, having batter not more than half an inch thick. Pare 
and cut into eighths enough large, tart apples to cover the top of the 
cake by laying the pieces close together in rows, pressing the sharp edges 
into the dough; brush well with softened but not melted butter, sprinkle 
thickly with granulated sugar and bake in a hot oven. When done dust 
with powdered sugar and cinnamon. 

Dutch Apple Cake. — Measure a pint of sifted flour, add half a level 
teaspoonful salt, quarter of a cupful of sugar and a scant teaspoonful 
of soda. Sift three tim.es. Beat up one egg with a cupful of sour milk. 
Rub a third of a cupful of butter into the flour thoroughly ; then mix 
in the liquid, making a soft dough. Spread this half an inch thick in a 
well-greased biscuit pan. Pare and core five juicy, nicely-flavored apples, 
and cut them into eighths; arrange them in parallel rows, sharp edges 
down, on top of the dough, pressing down so that they are partially 



92 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

imbedded in the dough. Sprinkle over thickly with sugar and a little 
cinnamon and spread with bits of butter. Bake in a quick oven for 25 
minutes. Serve hot as a dessert or tea cake. Made with fresh, ripe 
peaches cut in quarters, it is delicious. Omit the cinnamon when peaches 
are used. 

Apple Kuchen. — ^One pint of flour, one teaspoonful of cream of tartar, 
one-half teaspoonful of soda, one-half teaspoonful salt, an tgg, a cupful 
of milk, two tablesponfuls of butter, four large apples. Sift salt, soda 
and cream of tartar with the flour and rub in the butter. Put the 
beaten egg into the milk and mix with the flour. Spread the dough 
one-half inch thick on a buttered pan. Cut the pared apples in eighths 
and stick into the dough in rows. Sprinkle with sugar and bake 25 
minutes. 

Apple Layer Cake. — One cupful of sugar creamed with half a cupful 
of butter; add the beaten yolks of four eggs, one-half cupful of milk, 
two cupfuls of flour, with two level teaspoonfuls of baking powder sifted 
through it. One teaspoonful of lemon or almond extract and the beaten 
whites of the eggs. Bake in three layers. When cold spread with this 
mixture : Peel and grate four large apples, beat into them one cupful of 
sugar, two teaspoonfuls of melted butter and two whipped eggs. Pour 
into a porcelain saucepan and stir steadily over a moderate fire until the 
mixture has boiled one minute. Remove from the fire, add two tea- 
spoonfuls of lemon juice, a dash of powdered cinnamon and two table- 
spoonfuls of minced almonds. Cool it and build the cake, sprinkling 
the top with powdered sugar. Cap the top generously with whipped 
cream, flavored, and serve at the table. 

Apple Sauce Cake. — One cup sugar, ^ cup shortening, one saltspoon 
salt, J^ teaspoon ground cloves, one teaspoon cinnamon, i^ teaspoon 
grated nutmeg, V/i cup raisins, more fruit if desired; one teaspoon soda 
dissolved in a little water, one cup unsweetened apple sauce. Put the 
dissolved soda into the sauce, let it foam over the ingredients ; 1^ cup 
flour; bake 45 minutes. 

Apricot Shortcake. — Drain the juice away from the fruit, and cut it 
in small pieces. Set in a warm place and proceed to mix the cake. This 
calls for one cupful of flouf, four teaspoonfuls of baking powder, two 
teaspoonfuls of sugar, and half a teaspoonful of salt sifted together. 
Into this work four tablespoonfuls of butter, add three-fourths of a. 
cupful of milk, and stir into a light dough. Roll in a' floured bowl, and 
when one-fourth of an inch thick cut into generous squares. Brush 
the squares with melted butter, lay one on top of the other, and bake in 
a hot oven. When done separate the pieces, sprejid the fruit between the 
layers and on top, and pile whipped cream over all. A sweet sauce which 
may be served with the shortcake is made by adding to a cupful of the

fruit juice one tablespoonful of cornstarch wet in a little water and 
boiled for a few minutes. A tablespoonful of butter is melted into the 
sauce and a tablespoonful of lemon juice is added just before serving. 

Bath Cake. — One cup of sugar, one-half cup of butter, two-thirds of 
a cup of sweet milk, whites of four eggs beaten to a stiff froth, two cups 
of flour, one teaspoonful of baking powder and one-fourth teaspoonful 
of baking soda. Flavor with vanilla. Bake in square, shallow tins (two 
will be required). These cakes should be iced in the tins, while warm, 
and glazed in a hot oven. Then score the icing (without cutting the 
cake or allowing the icing to harden) into two-inch squares, placing in 
the center of each square one-half of an English walnut. Set away 
in tins in a cool place until thoroughly cold, when the squares may be 
cut out. These little cakes look very pretty and are quite a delicacy. 

Black Angel Cake. — One tgg, half a cupful of sweet milk, half a 
cupful of sugar, one -third cake Baker's unsweetened chocolate. Cook 
these ingredients till it thickens and let cool while making the cake part 
as follows : One cupful of sugar, half cupful butter creamed, two eggs 
beaten separctely, half cupful sweet milk, two cupfuls flour, half tea- 
spoonful soda in the milk (do not use any cream of tartar), half 
teaspoonful vanilla. ]\Iix the cake thoroughly, then add the chocolate 
paste and beat well. Bake in two layers and put together with white 
icing. This is a delicious cake. 

Black Cake, Inexpensive. — Beat one cup of butter with one cup of 
brown sugar until creamy; add two well-beaten eggs, one cup of cold 
cofTee, three-fourths of a cup of molasses, one cup of seeded raisins, 
one cup of currants, quarter of a pound of citron shredded and a tea- 
spoonful each of ground cloves, allspice and cinnamon sifted with four 
cups of browned flour and two teaspoonfuls of baking powder. Mix 
the fruit in with the butter and sugar instead of flouring it to prevent 
the fruit from sinking when brown flour is used in the cake. A little 
flour may be required to make the batter stiff, as browning the flour 
lessens the thickening property. 

Blackberry Jam Cake. — One and one-quarter cupful of sugar; one- 
half cupful butter; four eggs; four tablespoonfuls of loppered milk; one 
small teaspoonful soda; two cupfuls flour; one teaspoonful of cinnamon;

teaspoonfuls of baking powder, a heaping tablespoonful of sugar and a 
teaspoonful of salt; sift well together. Beat one tgg until light; add 
1^2 cupful of milk. Make a well in the center of the flour and gradually 
pour in the liquid, stirring in the flour. In this way you can keep the 
batter smooth. Make it to the consistency of cake batter. Melt two 



94 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

level tablespoonfuls of butter and add to the batter; then two cupfuls of 
floured blueberries. Bake in the little custard cups or muffin rings, 
allowing a little longer time than for plain muffins. Blackberries are 
nice used in this way. 

Bohemian Butter Kuchen. — Dissolve one cake of dry yeast in a half 
cup of warm milk; then add another cup of warm milk, one and one-half 
cups of flour, one-half teaspoon of salt and beat to a smooth batter; let 
rise till very light. Cream together half a cup of butter, half a cup of 
sugar, two eggs and the grated rind of a lemon. Add this to the sponge 
and enough flour to make a soft dough. Let rise again to double its 
size; divide into three parts (handle as little as possible). Put each part 
in a shallow buttered pan and let rise again to double its height. Pour 
over each two tablespoonfuls melted butter, sprinkle with three table- 
spoonfuls of sugar and a little cinnamon. Bake 25 minutes. 

Brownie's Cake. — One cupful of brown sugar beaten to a cream with 
half a cupful of butter; add the well-beaten yolks of four eggs an<l 
half a cupful of strong cold coffee. Ground cloves, cinnamon, allspice 
and nutmeg to taste ; 2>^ cupfuls of flour sifted with two teaspoonfuls of 
baking powder, and last of all the whites of the eggs beaten to a stiff 
froth and folded in. Bake in two layers and fill in and ice with dark 
caramel icing, made as follows : Put four cupfuls of brown sugar in a 
saucepan with a cupful of sweet cream or rich milk and boil until it will 
thread from a spoon. Take from the fire and beat until nearly cold and 
then put between the layers and over the cake. 

Butter Cookies. — Cream together one cupful of butter and one-half 
cupful of light brown sugar; then add one teaspoonful of vanilla and one 
well-beaten tgg. Slowly stir in two cupfuls of flour. ]\Iold lightly with 
the hand. Take out a small portion of the dough each time; roll as thin 
as a silver dollar, cut the cookies with a cutter no larger than the dollar. 
Bake in a moderate oven until a golden brown. This will make one 
pound and a quarter of rich, crisp cookies. 

Butternut Cake. — Beat half a cup of butter to a cream. Gradually 
beat in ^ of a cup of granulated sugar, and then one cup of butternut 
meats and one tgg beaten without separating. Sift together two cups of 
entire wheat flour, one-third of a cup of pastry flour, one-half teaspoon- 
ful soda, one-fourth teaspoonful salt, one-half teaspoonful mace, one- 
fourth teaspoonful cloves, and ^ teaspoonful cinnamon. Add this to 
the first mixture alternately with one cup of sour milk. Beat thoroughly 
and turn into little tins fitted with rounds of paper on the bottoms and 
thoroughly buttered. Bake about 25 minutes. The recipe makes 18 
cakes. When cold, ice with the icing made 6i brown sugar, and deco- 
rate with halves of butternut meats. The icing is made as follows: 
Boil one cup of brown sugar and one-third cup of water to 240 de-

grees Fahrenheit. Then pour in a fine stream on to the white of one 
egg, beaten very light. Continue the beating while the syrup is being 
added to the egg and for some minutes afterward. Without a ther- 
mometer, to decide the temperature, boil the sugar until it spins a thread 
about three inches in length. 

Chocolate Cake. — Two eggs, one-half cup butter, one-half cup cocoa, 
one cup milk, one cup sugar, two teaspoonfuls baking powder ; two tea- 
spoonfuls vanilla, a good cup and one-half of flour. If it is not the 
proper consistency, then add a little more flour. 

Chocolate Cream Cake. — Use any good cake recipe and bake in a 
square pan. When cold cover with the following icing: To one and one- 
half cupful of sugar add one-half cupful of sweet milk. Place on stove 
and cook, after it begins to boil, for four minutes. Do not stir it. Pour 
cut on a platter and beat until thick enough to spread on the cake. 
While making this frosting have one and one-half square of chocolate 
melting, and after covering the cake with the frosting spread the choco- 
late smoothly over it. 

Coffee Cake. — Cream one-quarter cup of butter with one cup of sugar, 
add one tgg beaten, one-half cup milk, a pinch of salt and one and one- 
half cupfuls of sifted flour with a teaspoonful of baking powder. Spread 
in pan and sprinkle with seeded and cleaned raisins or currants, a little 
shredded citron, dot with butter and sift over sugar and cinnamon. Bake 
one-half hour and serve hot. 

Coffee Chocolate Cake. — Cream one cup of sugar and half a cup of 
butter; add the yolks of four eggs and half a cup of strong cold coffee. 
Sift in V/i cup of flour with two teaspoonfuls of baking powder. Lastly 
stir in 1^^ square of melted chocolate. Bake in a loaf and ice with whitf 
frosting. 

Coffee Fruit Cake. — This requires neither eggs nor milk. One-half 
cup butter, one and one-half cups sugar, one and one-half cups cold 
strong coffee, one-half cup molasses, one teaspoonful soda, one cup rai- 
sins, one teaspoonful cinnamon, one teaspoonful cloves, one-half teaspoon- 
ful nutmeg. Flour for thick batter, adding one level teaspoonful baking 
powder. For frosting without eggs, use one cupful of granulated sugar, 
five tablespoonfuls of milk; boil four or five minutes till it threads from 
the spoon. Flavor as desired. Add chocolate or not. Stir till right 
thickness for spreading. This is fine-grained, white (if chocolate is not 
used) and delicious. 

Cornstarch Cake. — Two cups of white sugar and one cup of butter 
creamed together. One cup of sweet milk, the whites of five eggs beaten 
very stiff, one cup of cornstarch, two cups of flour, two teaspoonfuls of 
baking powder and two of extract of lemon. Bake slowly in a moderate

sugar when cool. 

Crullers, Olive Oil. — To one-half cup of sugar add two tablespoons of 
oil, two beaten eggs, one-half teaspoon of salt, one-fourth teaspoon of

gether, three eggs, well beaten into sugar and shortening, three teaspoon- 
fuls baking powder, 3yi cupfuls flour. To this add one cupful of stoned 
and finely-chopped dates, floured. Bake in five layers and put together 
Vv'ith plain or boiled icin* 

Dolly Varden Cake. — Cream one-half cup butter with one cup sugar. 
Add one-half cup milk alternately with one and one-half cup of flour 
in which has been mixed one teaspoonful baking powder. Lastly fold 
in the dry-beaten whites of three eggs and flavor to taste. Bake in loaf 
for one-half hour in a moderately quick oven. For icing make a syrup 
of one and one-half cup sugar and eight tablespoonfuls water. Boil, 
when this strings from spoon, add the well-beaten yolks of three eggs 
and continue beating for one-half hour. Flavor like cake and pour 
thickly over the cake. 

Doughnuts, Best.— One tgg beaten light; one cupful of sugar and a 
little salt; one cupful of sour milk sweetened with one teaspoonful of 
soda; two tablespoonfuls of melted lard; flour to make a stiff dough. 
Fry in hot lard, and dust with cinnamon and granulated sugar. These 
doughnuts are light and wholesome. 

Doughnuts, Potato. — Two cups of mashed potatoes (hot), four ta- 
blespoonfuls of shortening, three cupfuls of sugar, four eggs, five tea- 
spoonfuls of baking powder, three cupfuls milk, salt, nutmeg, and lastly 
flour enough to stiffen. Make a cream of potatoes, shortening, sugar and 
eggs, then add milk, salt and nutmeg, flour sifted with baking powder, 
and cook in boiling lard. 

Dried Apple Cake. — Soak the dried apples over night and in the morn- 
ing chop fine, having two cupfuls; then simmer in two cupfuls of molasses 
until apples are soft. Cream two cupfuls of sugar with a scant cupful 
of butter; add three well beaten eggs; then the apples and molasses; 
half a pound of raisins seeded, three cupfuls of flour, sifted with two 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 97 

tcaspoonfuls baking powder and half a teaspoonfiil each of cinnamon, 
cloves and grated nutmeg. Bake in very moderate oven as you would 
fruit cake. 

Dutch Cake. — Take two pounds of raised bread dough, one pint of 
sugar, half a cupful of butter (or more if it is to be made quite rich), 
half a nutmeg grated, one teaspoonful of cinnamon and a pound of large 
laisins. ]Mix well and put in a greased pan. Let it rise about three- 
quarters of an hour, or until the loaf is nearly double its original size, 
and bake in a moderate oven. This is very good when fresh ; if we wish 
to make it richer we use an tgg, which is mixed in with the butter. Us- 
ing currants instead of raisins, we have the English currant loaf. The 
same recipe makes very nice buns. 

Election Cake. — Rub into half a pound of sifted flour five ounces of 
butter, add a saltspoonful of salt, one cupful of sugar; mix. Scald two 
cupfuls of miilk, and when lukewarm add one yeast cake dissolved, and 
two eggs well beaten. Make a hole in the center of the flour, pour in 
the milk mixture, stir in a little of the flour; cover and stand aside for 
three hours. Then beat in all the flour, add the juice of three oranges, 
a tablespoonful of cinnamon and half a nutmeg grated; turn into a 
greased round pan and, when very light, bake in a moderate oven for 
one hour. 

Eggless Cake. — Beat one cupful of sugar and half a cupful of butter 
to a cream; add a cupful of miilk, measure two cupfuls of sifted flour, 
add three tcaspoonfuls of baking powder, a level teaspoonful of cinna- 
mon, half a teaspoonful of grated nutmeg and a pinch of cloves. Sift 
several times until the flour is light and fluffy, then stir into the other 
materials, add cupful seeded floured raisins. Bake in moderate oven. 

Eggless Cake with Oil- — Cream one-half cup oil and one cupful sugar, 
one cupful sour milk, one teaspoonful soda, one teaspoonful each of cas- 
sia and cloves, one-half cupful chopped raisins (if desired) one-half 
teaspoonful salt, two cupfuls warmed flour. Be sure not to forget the 
salt, as the oil contains none. This must always be remembered ; in using 
the oil add twice as much salt as common. 

Eggless Fruit Cake. — One cup of sugar, one cup of butter, one cup of 
buttermilk, two cups of sifted flour, one cup of raisins (seeded and 
chopped), one teaspoonful of cinnamon, one-half teaspoonful of cloves, 
cne-half teaspoonful of nutmeg. Beat the sugar and butter to a cream; 
dissolve the soda in a little hot water and stir it into the milk, and add 
next the spices. Flour the raisins and add them last. Bake in a well-but- 
tered tin, on the bottom of v/hich place a clean white paper, also well 
buttered. 

Layer Cake Without Eggs. — One cupful of sugar, quarter of a cupful 
of butter, one cupful of sweet milk, one teaspoonful of soda, two of 



98 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

cream of tartar, one tablespoonful of cornstarch made smooth in a little 
milk, two cupfuls of flour. Bake in thin sheets and put together with 
boiled sugar frosting, jelly, cocoanut or any other rich filling desired, 
finish the top with the boiled sugar frosting made by boiling together a 
cupful of sugar and one of water until it will turn creamy white and 
thick on being stirred. This is quite as delicious as the frosting made 
from the whites of eggs. 

Noel Fruit Cake. — This contains neither butter nor eggs. One pound 
fat salt pork chopped fine, one cupful brown sugar, one cupful New Or- 
leans molasses in which is dissolved one teaspoonful of soda, one pound 
each of raisins, currants and figs chopped fine, one-fourth pound of 
citron chopped fine, one wineglass of coffee (substituted for brandy), 
2^ cupfuls of flour well browned. This will make one large loaf or two 
small ones. The longer kept the better it is. This may be iced or not. 
A boiled milk frosting is good while eggs are high. 

Eggless Waffles. — Mix at night a batter with sour milk if you have 
it; if not, sweet will answer. To each quart of milk, with flour for bat- 
ter, add one tablespoonful each of butter and sugar, one-half teaspoonful 
salt. If sweet milk is used add small quantity yeast or one-quarter com- 
pressed yeast cake. In the morning add enough baking soda to correct 
acidity — you will have to try baking a little to get it right. 

Russian Fried Cakes. — Scald one pint of milk, add one scant tea- 
spoonful of salt and one tablespoonful of sugar; when lukewarm add 
one yeast cake dissolved in a little warm water, and sufficient flour to 
make a drop batter, and set aside to rise. When light and spongy add 
one-half cupful of butter, creamed together with one cupful of sugar 
and three eggs; beat until thoroughly mixed; add sufficient flour to 
make a soft dough and knead for five minutes. Return to the bowl ; 
cover and keep in a warm place until light. Turn out on a floured board ; 
roll out quite thin and cut into three-inch circles. On one-half of these 
cakes place a small spoonful of any firm jam or marmalade. Cover with 
the remaining cakes and pinch each together securely. Cover with a 
floured cloth, and let stand for 20 minutes; then drop a few at a time 
into smoking hot fat. When well browned and puffed up draw on un- 
glazed paper and roll in powdered sugar. 

Fruit Cake. — Three pounds flour, one pound butter, 5^ pound lard, 
two pounds stoned raisins, two pounds currants, one pound mixed can- 
died peel, sliced, two teaspoonfuls each of ground allspice, cinnamon, 
cloves, nutmeg and ginger; two pounds brown sugar; a little salt; one 
cup milk; eight eggs; two teaspoonfuls baking powder. If all baked 
in one loaf bake for four hours. 

Graham Fruit Cake.— Sift three cups of sifted graham flour, two cups 
of white flour, one teaspoon each of clove, allspice, soda and salt and 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 99 

two teaspoons of cinnamon. To two cups of sugar add one cup of mo- 
lasses and two cups of milk alternately with the sifted flour mixture. 
Beat thoroughly and add three cups each of seeded raisins and citron, 
both slightly floured. Bake in a moderate oven for one hour. 

Maple Sugar Fruit Cake.— Cream one cupful of butter and add to it 
two cupfuls of maple sugar, one of maple syrup, three beaten eggs, one 
small cupful of milk with a rounding teaspoonful of soda dissolved in it, 
five cupfuls of flour sifted with two teaspoonfuls of cream tartar and a 
little salt. Mix all together and add one pound of raisins, one of cur- 
rants, half a pound of citron and a quarter of a pound of orange peel, 
all well floured. No spices are used, as the maple sugar flavors the 
cake. 

Old-Fashioned Fruit Cake. — This is intended for rolling out and bak- 
ing in flat pans, instead of the usual loaf. Take two and a half cupfuls 
of sugar, creamed up with half a cupful of butter, half a cupful of sour 
milk, a teaspoonful of soda, half a teaspoonful each of cinnamon, nut- 
meg and ground cloves, a cupful of raisins and one of currants, with a 
little chopped citron and enough flour to make quite stiff. Knead all 
together, roll about two inches thick and bake in a moderate oven. 
Spread the layers with boiled sugar frosting and cut into squares before 
the frosting hardens. 

Poor Man's Fruit Cake. — Seed and chop a quarter of a pound of 
dates; mix with them one cupful of seeded raisins, and dust them with 
one-half cupful of flour. Dissolve a level teaspoonful of baking soda in 
two tablespoonfuls of warm v/ater; add to it half a pint of very thick 
sour cream, stir a moment and add one cupful of brown sugar, half a 
tumblerful of currant or blackberry jelly, a tablespoonful of cinnamon, a 
teaspoonful of allspice and two cupfuls and a half of flour. Beat thor- 
oughly, add the fruit, mix well and turn into a greased square pan. Bake 
in a very slow oven for one hour and a half. This cake will be quite 
equal to plain fruit cake if the cream is very thick, and it is allowed to 
stand a week before cutting. 

German Cookies. — To one cup of sugar, one cup of butter, one cup 
of lard, one cup of molasses, the juice and grated rind of one lemon, 
one tablespoonful of vinegar, one teaspoonful each of cinnamon and 
ginger, one and one-half teaspoonful of soda, add one Qgg, one cup of 
nuts, one tablespoonful each of candied citron and orange peel chopped 
fine and flour enough to make stiff. The dough must be stiff or the 
cookies will not retain the shape in baking. 

Colonial Gingerbread. — Put a cupful of New Orleans molasses in a 
mixing bowl with half a cupful of butter" and half a cupful of sugar. 
Over this pour a cupful of boiling water in which a level dessertspoonful 
of soda has already been dissolved. Stir well, and let the mixture 



100 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

cool; then add a cupful of chopped walnuts and a cupful of seeded rai- 
sins, a teaspoonful each of cinnamon and ginger, two and one-half cup- 
fuls of flour, and, lastly, two well-beaten eggs. Bake in a shallow pan 
and serve while still warm from the oven. 

Honey Gingerbread. — Wanu a generous half cup of butter and beat 
into it two cups of strained honey. When you have a light cream beat 
in one tablespoon of powdered sugar, a tablespoon of ginger and one- 
half teaspoon of cinnamon. Add the beaten yolks of four eggs, and al- 
ternately with the frothed whites, three even cups of flour sifted twice 
with one teaspoon of baking powder. Beat hard for one minute and 
bake in buttered shallow pans for 45 minutes. Keep covered for 30 
minutes. 

Shiny Gingerbread. — This is very crackly and shiny on top. The 
secret of making it thus is to pour the shortening boiling hot on the, 
molasses and beat the batter as little as possible. Pour a small half- 
teacupful of boiling hot shortening, lard and butter, or beef suet and 
butter mixed, upon one-half pint of New Orleans molasses ;• add two 
lablespoonfuls of milk, a tablespoonful of ground ginger, a teaspoonful 
of cinnamon; then sift in about three-quarters of a pint of flour, to 
which a teaspoonful of baking soda has been added; lastly add a well- 
beaten egg, then mix with a few deft turns of the spoon and bake in one 
large pan or two small ones in a moderate oven; serve hot, and break, 
not cut, at the table. 

Ginger Snaps. — Beat together one cupful of sugar, one egg, and one 
tablespoonful of ginger. Heat one cupful of molasses to the scalding 
point, stir into it one teaspoonful of soda or saleratus, and, while it 
foams, pour it over the butter and egg, and beat together. Add a table- 
spoonful of vinegar, and stir in lightly enough flour to roll out and cut 
the dough. 

Half-Pound Cake. — ^One pound of sugar, one pound of flour, one-half 
pound of butter, one teacupful of milk, four eggs. Flavor to taste. Whip 
up the sugar and eggs, putting in one egg at a time. Then stir in the 
milk and flavoring, following this with the flour, which must be very 
thoroughly beaten into the batter. Pour into paper-lined tins and bake 
in a steady oven for 45 minutes. This quantity should make two loaves. 
The oven must be well regulated, and care taken to avoid any jar, or 
the cake will be apt to fall in the middle. 

Hardenburg Cake. — This is an old-fashioned Dutch fruit cake. 
Cream together a pound and a half of butter and two pounds of gran- 
ulated sugar. Add one-half pint of New Orleans molasses, the beaten 
yolks of 12 eggs, two ounces of mixed spices — mace, cinnamon and 
cloves, two grated nutmegs, one-half pound candied peel — two pounds 
cleansed and dried currants, four pounds stoned and cut raisins, one- 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 101 

half pint pickled fruit syrup or boiled-down cider, and flour to make the 
ingredients hang together. If not self-raising flour, add a dessertspoonful 
of baking powder. About a pound and' a quarter of flour will be re- 
quired. Lastly, fold in the stiffly beaten whites of the eggs. Bake three, 
or four hours in a moderate even, taking care not to disturb. 

Honey Apple Cake.— Wash two cupfuls of dried apples (old-fash- 
ioned kind are the best) and soak them over night. Next morning drain 
them and mince as fine as posL-ible and simmer for two hours in a pint 
of honey. Pour into a bowl and add while hot half a cupful of butter, 
stir until butter is melted and mixed, then let cool. Add a cupful of 
sifted sugar and half a cupful of milk, a teaspoonful each of cloves and 
cinnamon, the grated rind of half a lem.on, two eggs well beaten and 
two cupfuls of flour in which you have mixed two teaspoonfuls of baking 
powder. Line long, shallow tins with buttered paper and pour in the 
batter to depth of half an inch. When baked cut into strips size of 
lady fingers and dust the surface with powdered sugar. 

Hot Cross Buns. — Sift into a large bowl one full quart of flour, half 
a cupful of sugar, and half a teaspoonful of salt; dissolve one-fourth 
of a cupful of butter in a generous half-pint of warm milk, and add to 
the dry ingredients, Avith the yolks of two beaten eggs; add half a 
yeast cake dissolved in a little water, half a nutmeg grated, and the 
whites of the two eggs, beaten stiff; this should make a very soft dough. 
Cover the bowl with a clean cloth, place it where it will keep warm, 
and let it rise over night. In the morning take pieces of the dough the 
size of an egg and, with a little flour, mold them into round cakes an 
inch in thickness. Place them on a buttered tin, leaving a little space 
between. Cover the tins and set in a warm place for the buns to rise; 
they should be double their original size. With a sharp knife cut a 
cross in the center of each bun. Bake them in a moderate oven for 
about half an hour. When the buns are baked, brush the top with a 
syrup made of sugar and water. A few currants or a little candied 
peel is usually added to this recipe. 

Icing, Plain. — Dissolve one cupful of granulated sugar in one-quarter 
of a cupful of hot water; flavor with essence of vanilla or some orange 
juice and cook until it threads. Then pour it slowly over the whipped 
white of an tgg, beating the mixture all the time until cool. 

Imperial Cake. — One pound of sugar, one pound of flour, three-quar- 
ters pound of butter, one pound of almonds, blanched and cut fine; one- 
half pound of citron, one-quarter pound candied cherries, one-half pound 
of seeded raisins, rind and juice of one lemon, two pieces of candied 
orange, one nutmeg, 10 eggs. Bake in a loaf in a moderate oven. This 
is a rich and delicious cake, that can be made some time before it is used. 

Grandmother's Jumbles. — Work three-quarters of a pound of butter 



102 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

into a pound and a half of flour and half a pound of sugar. Flavor with 
grated nutmeg, cinnamon or lemon extract, and add three well beaten 
eggs. Work all well together into a smooth paste and roll out an eighth 
of an inch in thickness. Sprinkle crushed loaf sugar over it and cut into 
round cakes with a very small cutter ; take out the center. Lay on bak- 
ing sheets and bake in a quick oven, without browning, about 10 minutes. 

Jumbles Without Eggs. — A half cupful each of butter and slightly 
soured milk, one cupful of sugar, a half teaspoonful of soda, saltspoonful 
of salt, the same of nutmeg and cinnamon mixed, the grated yellow rind 
of half a lemon, and a teaspoonful of lemon juice, two cupfuls of flour 
to stifl^en. Bake in rings in a hot oven. A cupful of clean, light, new- 
fallen snow stirred into cake, or other batters, briskly, the very last thing 
before turning it into the baking pan, is a good substitute for eggs. When 
snow is used a little more flour is required — about two tablespoonfuls. 

Lady Baltimore Cake. — One cupful of butter, two cupfuls of sugar, 
three and one-half cupfuls of flour, one cupful sweet milk, the whites 
of six eggs, two level teaspoonfuls of baking powder and a teaspoonful 
of rose \A^ater. ]\Iix as directed for white cakes and bake in three layers, 
with this filling: Dissolve three cupfuls of granulated sugar in one cup- 
ful of boiling water, cook until it threads, then pour gradually over the 
stiffly-beaten whites of three eggs, stirring constantly. Add to this icing 
one cupful of chopped raisins, one cupful of chopped nut meats (pecans 
preferred), and five figs cut in very thin strips. Ice and emboss top and 
sides of cake. 

Lady Fingers. — Beat the whites of three eggs until very stiff, then beat 
in gradually one-third of a cup of sugar and just a bit of salt. Beat the 
yolks of three eggs until light and thick and add to the whites, putting 
in at the same time a little vanilla extract. Fold in one-third of a cup 
of flour. Shape on a buttered tin to resemble those sold in the shops; 
that is, make them very thin and about four and one-half inches long by 
one inch wide. Dust with confectioner's sugar and bake in a moderate 
oven. About eight minutes will be required for the baking. 

Lebkuchen. — Take a cupful of butter and one of sugar, pour over them 
two cupfuls of honey heated to the boiling point. Add a generous handful 
of blanched almonds, a grated nutmeg and a teaspoonful of cinnamon. 
Dissolve a scant teaspoonful of soda in water and add to the ingre- 
dients. Mix with flour until the dough is as stiff as for ginger cookies. 
Roll out like cookies. Cut into oblong cakes and bake until well 
browned. 

Lemon Sponge Cake. — Three eggs, one-half cupful granulated sugar, 
one-half cupful of sifted flour, the juice and grated rind of one lemon, 
one-half teaspoonful of baking powder. Beat the whites of eggs very 
stiff, beat the yolks and add. When well mixed add the sugar slowly 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 103 

and beat; grate the outside of rind of lemon and add the juice, then 
beat all with tgg beater three minutes. Sift in the flour in which the 
baking powder has been mixed and stir slowly and carefully, but do not 
beat after flour is in. Bake in a moderate oven 35 minutes. 

Maple Layer Cake.— Make a tender layer cake by any good recipe, and 
bake in three large layers. For a filling take two cupfuls of maple su- 
gar, add one cup of water and boil until it will wax when dropped in 
cold water. Then remove from the fire and add two teaspoonfuls of but- 
ter and stir speedily till it v.-ill spread on the cake. Add one-half tea- 
spoonful of vanilla and put between the layers. 

Molasses Cookies. — Take one cupful of sugar and one cupful of but- 
ter or good shortening. Cream them and add two cups of molasses and 
two eggs. Dissolve two good-sized teaspoonfuls of soda in a little hot 
v/ater, and fillup the cup it is in with cold water. Add it to the other 
mixture and stir in enough flour to make a soft dough, but one that can 
be rolled out and cut into cookies. Spice to suit the taste. 

Delicious Nut Cake.— Cream half a cupful of sugar, adding the stiffly 
beaten whites of three eggs and beating very light; then add, by alter- 
nate bits, two-thirds of a cupful of milk and one and a half cupfuls of 
flour mixed with two level teaspoonfuls of baking powder. At the last 
turn in a cupful of minced English walnut meat and bake in a shallow 
tin. When the cake is cool cover with icing, mark in squares and put 
nut meat on the top of each. 

Nut Wafers. — Two eggs, one cup of sugar, two tablespoonfuls of 
flour, one cup of nut meats chopped fine. Hickorynuts are preferred, 
and the sugar should be light brown. Spread the mixture in a very thin 
layer on a well-greased tin and bake ten minutes or until well tinged 
with brown. Cut in squares and remove from the tin as soon as they are 
done, that the wafers may grow crispy in the air. 

Oatmeal Cookies. — Cream three-fourths of a cupful of butter with one 
cupful of sugar; add two well-beaten eggs. Sift three-fourths of a tea- 
spoonful of soda into two cupfuls of flour; add one-half a teaspoonful 
of salt, one teaspoonful of cinnamon; now add to the mixture two cup- 
fuls of uncooked rolled oats and one scant cupful of chopped raisins 
sprinkled with a little flour. Drop by the teaspoonful into a greased 
pan ;, bake in moderate oven. 

Oatmeal Crisps. — One tabler.poonful of butter, creamed, one cup of 
sugar, added gradually; two and one-half cups rolled oats; two teaspoons 
baking powder well mixed with the oats ; two eggs, well beaten, one- 
half teaspoon of salt and two teaspoons vanilla in the eggs. Mix in the 
order given ; bake in a medium to slow oven. A heaping teaspoonful of 
mixture makes a dainty crisp. Allow room for them to spread in the 
pan. If you cannot get on without flour use a little best bread flour — 
not pastry. 



104 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Oatmeal Macaroons. — Cream two level tablespoonfuls of butter, scant 
measure; add gradually half a cup of sugar, then the beaten yolks of 
two large eggs beaten again with half a cup of sugar. Then stir in 2^ 
cupfuls of rolled oats, mixed with 2>^ level teaspoonfuls of baking 
powder and one-fourth teaspoonful of salt. Flavor with one teaspoonful 
of vanilla, then fold in the whites of two eggs, beaten dry. Drop with a 
teaspoon on to a buttered baking-sheet, making little rounds about three 
inches apart, and bake in a slow oven. 

Orange Cake. — Sift together four times IJ.^ cupful of flour and 1>^ 
teaspoonful of baking powder. Beat well two eggs, add one cupful of 
sugar, one-half cupful of milk, one tablespoonful of melted butter and 
the same quantity of orange juice; then the sifted flour and baking pow- 
der. Bake in a square, shallow tin. When cooked split open and fill 
with a cream made as follows: Into a cup squeeze the juice of one 
orange, add a tablespoonful of lemon juice and hot water to fill the cup, 
put this on to cook in a double boiler, thicken with one tablespoonful of 
cornstarch wet with cold water, and add the grated rind of half an 
orange, one teaspoonful of butter, two heaping tablespoonfuls of sugar 
and the yolk of an tg^. 

Othello Cake, or Devil's Food. — Part first — One cupful of dark brown 
sugar; one-half cupful of butter; one Qgg and yolks of two; one-half 
cupful sweet milk; one teaspoonful soda, two cupfuls flour, measured 
before sifting; two teaspoonfuls vanilla extract. Part second — One cup- 
ful dark brown sugar, one cupful grated chocolate, one-half cupful sweet 
milk. Grate the chocolate, add milk and sugar, put in a double boiler, 
and place on the back of stove until dissolved; but do not boil. Prepare 
this first and have dissolving while preparing part first. To mix part 
first, cream the butter, sugar and eggs, together, dissolve the soda in milk, 
and add to butter and sugar. Add the flour tablespoonful at a time 
until all is in, beating lightly. Beat part second into part first and bake 
in two layers. 

Panoche Cake. — Make any good white cake, and bake in two layers. 
Make a filling as follows : Boil together two cupfuls of brown sugar and 
one-half cupful milk until they harden in cold water. Then add a tea- 
spoonful of vanilla and a tablespoonful of butter. Stir while cooking. 
To half of this mixture add one-half cupful of English walnut meats; as 
soon as cool enough spread between the layers. Spread the remainder 
of the mixture on top of the cske, and decorate with half walnut meats. 

Peanut Cookies. — One-half cupful of butter, one cupful granulated 
sugar, one-half cupful milk, one Qgg, one pint flour, two teaspoonfuls 
baking powder, one heaping cupful chopped peanuts. Cream the butter 
and sugar, add the milk and egg — beating white and yolk separately — 
ihen the baking powder mixed with part of the flour, and lastly the re- 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 105 

mainder of the flour, in which has been mixed the nuts. Handle very 
I'ttle and do not roll too thin. 

Pork Cake. — One pound of fat salt pork, chopped fine, and dissolved 
i-i one pint of boiling water, three cups of brown sugar, one cup mo- 
lasses, one pound each of raisins and currants, two tablespoonfuls of 
cinnamon, one teaspooriful cloves, two nutmegs grated, grated zest of one 
orange and lemon, one teaspoonful baking soda, two teaspoonfuls of 
cream of tartar, seven cups of sifted flour. Bake in moderate oven. 
This amount makes three medium-sized loaf cakes. 

Potato Cake. — Two cups sugar, one-half cup butter, one cup hot 
mashed potato, four eggs beaten, one-half cup milk, one-fourth tea- 
spoon nutmeg, one-fourth teaspoon cloves, one-half teaspoon cinnamon, 
one cup walnut meats chopped fine, two rounding cups flour, two tea- 
spoons baking powder, two ounces chocolate melted over hot water and 
mixed with potato; add to sugar and butter and mix as usual. Bake in 
three layers and put together with frosting. 

Pound Cake. — Mix a pound of sugar with three-quarters of a pound 
of butter. When worked white, stir in the yolks of eight eggs beaten to 
a froth, then the whites. Add a pound of sifted flour and mace or nutmeg 
to taste. If you wish to have your cake particularly nice, stir in, just 
before you put it into the pans, a quarter of a pound of citron or al- 
monds blanched, and powdered fine in rosewater. 

Raised Cake. — Two cupfuls light sponge, one cupful sugar, one-half 
cupful butter, two well-beaten eggs, one cupful stoned raisins, floured, 
half a nutmeg, grated, one-half teaspoonful soda dissolved in a little 
water. Make into a loaf or loaves, and when light bake in rather slow 
oven, as it scorches easily. If desired, cover it with a milk icing, for 
which use 10 teaspoonfuls sweet milk, 1^ cupful sugar. Boil six min- 
utes, take from stove and stir until quite white, flavor, spread quickly 
with a knife dipped in cold water. 

Raisin-Cake Squares. — Sift and dry half a pound of flour, rub into this 
two ounces of butter and a very little lard, add three ounces of sugar, a 
teaspoonful of baking powder and six ounces of stoned raisins. Beat 
two eggs with a spoonful of milk, and add to the dry ingredients; add 
a pinch of ground cinnamon and beat all to a light batter; pour into 
a greased pudding tin and bake in a sharp oven; when cooled a little 
cut with a hot knife into squares and serve while still warm. 

Rochester Cake.— Two cups sugar; two-thirds butter; one cup sweet 
milk; three eggs; three cups flour; two teaspoonfuls baking powder; a 
little salt and flavoring. Put half the mixture in two jelly cake pans. To 
the remainder add one tablespoon molasses ; one cup chopped raisins or 
currants; one-fourth pound chopped citron; one teaspoon cinnamon; one- 
half teaspoon cloves; one-half teaspoon allspice; a little nutmeg; one 



106 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

tablespoon flour. Put in two other jelly cake pans. Put the cakes to- 
gether while warm with a little jelly or raspberry jam between them, 
dark and light layers alternately. 

Rose Layer Cake. — Two cups of sugar, one cup of butter, a fourth 
of a cup of sweet milk, whites of eight eggs beaten stiff, three and a 
fourth cups of flour and two teaspoonfuls of baking powder. Bake in 
jelly tins. Grease the tins well and dust flour over every part before 
putting in the batter. Boil two cups of powdered sugar in a half tea- 
cupful of water, stirring constantly. When very thick pour boiling-hot 
over the beaten whites of two eggs. Beat until almost cold. Flavor 
with rose extract and color with cochineal. Put the cakes together with 
this icing. For the pink coloring matter, buy Hve cents' worth of baker's 
cochineal of the druggist, put half a teaspoonful into a cup and cover 
with two teaspoonfuls of boiling water. Let stand an hour, add alum 
(powdered) the size of a large pea, and add drop by drop to the icing 
until of a pretty pink color. 

Sour Cream Cake. — One cup sugar, one cup sour cream, three-fourths 
cup raisins, one level teaspoonful salt, two eggs, two cups flour, one tea- 
spoonful each of saleratus and cinnamon, a saltspoonful ground cloves 
Beat well, bake in loaf or two layers, and use any white frosting for 
covering the cake. For the sour cream icing, use one cup sour cream, 
one and one-half cup sugar (granulated), three-fourths cup ground 
walnuts and hickory nuts. Boil in granite pan to soft ball stage, then stir 
briskly until nearly cold. If this should prove too stiff, add a table- 
spoonful sweet milk. 

Salem Spice Cake. — Cream a half cupful of butter with a cupful of 
sugar, add two eggs — one at a time — and beat until the mixture is very 
light. Sift lYz cupful of flour with one-fourth of a teaspoonful of salt, 
one teaspoonful of cinnamon and half a teaspoonful of cloves. Add the 
flour, a tablespoonful at a time, alternately with a half cupful of cold 
water, and add to the last tablespoonful of flour a teaspoonful of baking 
powder. Stir in a half cupful of cleaned and seeded raisins and bake in 
a shallow, well-greased pan in a moderate oven for 25 minutes. 

Spiced Molasses Wafers. — This is one of the daintiest gingerbreads. 
One cupful of brown sugar, one-half of a cupful of molasses, one table- 
spoonful of butter, one-half of a teaspoonful of powdered cinnamon, one- 
quarter of a teaspoonful of cloves, one-quarter of a teaspoonful of all- 
spice, two tablespoonfuls of flour. Put the molasses, sugar and butter in 
a saucepan and boil gently over the fire until, when tr;ed in cold water, 
a little of the mixture can be rolled into a very soft ball between the 
fingers; cover and set aside until cold. Add the spice, then the flour, 
and a pinch of salt. Butter liberally a number of shallow tins. Make 
a tester by dropping a teaspoonful of the mixture on a greased pan and 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 107 

baking it in a hot oven. This is necessary, as with some brands of flour 
a trifle more may be indicated. The mixture will spread very much and 
when taken from the oven the cake will be as thin as a wafer and should 
be taken at once from the pan. 

Berwick Sponge Cake. — Six eggs; powdered white sugar, three cup- 
fuls; sifted flour, four even cupfuls; cream of tartar, two teaspoonf uls ; 
soda, one teaspoonf ul; one cupful cold water, one-half of a lemon. 
First beat the eggs two minutes, add the sugar and beat five minutes more, 
then stir the cream of tartar in two cupfuls of the flour and beat one 
minute; dissolve the soda in the water and add; wash the lemon dry, 
then grate the rind and squeeze in the juice. Finally, add the remaining 
two cupfuls of flour and beat all one minute. Put into deep pans in a 
moderate oven. This will make two bars, or loaves. When it is done 
it smells like fresh popcorn. There is considerable beating about this 
cake, and therein lies the success. You can use three tablespoonfuls 
baking powder (if you wish, in place of cream of tartar and soda), but 
sift it in the two last cupfuls of flour. Have about the same heat as 
for raised bread, put into the oven and let it remain certainly 20 min- 
utes without looking at it. If it can bake until done without the oven 
door being opened, so much the better. 

Boiled Sponge Cake. — One and one-half cupful granulated sugar, two- 
thirds cupful water, boiled until clear; pour over (beating while you 
pour) the whites of five eggs which have been beaten very stiff in a large 
platter; now beat until cold, and add yolk of eggs beaten smooth, juice 
of a half lemon and one cupful of flour folded in gently. Bake in a slow 
oven about three-fourths hour. Bake in oblong pan about two to 2J^ 
inches deep. Can be iced with any icing preferred, and will keep in- 
definitely. 

Never-Fail Sponge Cake. — This can be made and baked in 35 min- 
utes. A good sponge should be yellow as gold, of velvety softness and 
tender as a marshm.allow. If the rule here given is strictly followed, 
such a cake will be the sure result : Separate the whites and yolks of 
four eggs. Beat the whites until stiff enough to remain in bowl if it is 
inverted, then beat into them one-half cup of sugar, which must be fine 
granulated (powdered sugar makes tough cake and proper beating does 
away entirely with the grains). Beat the yolks, add to them one-half 
cupful of sugar, beating for five minutes by the clock — this latter being 
important, as the delicate texture of the cake depends upon it; add to 
the yolks the grated rind and juice of one lemon. Now beat well to- 
gether the yolks and white. At this stage beating is in order, but must 
be absolutely avoided after adding the flour, of which take one cupful. 
The mixture should now look like a puff ball, and the flour is to be 
tossed or stirred into it with a light turn of the wooden spoon. Stirring 



108 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

is quite different from beating. The cupful of sugar must be generous, 
the flour scanty. Bake for 25 minutes in a moderate oven. Just be- 
fore putting in the oven sprinkle on top through a sifter about a table- 
spoonful of granulated sugar. This gives the "crackly" top crust so 
desirable. 

Tory Wafers. — Melt a teacup of butter, a half a cup of lard, and mix 
them with a quart of flour, a couple of beaten eggs, a teaspoonful of 
salt, and flavoring. Add milk till of the right consistency to roll out; 
roll it out about the third of an inch in thickness, cut it into cakes with 
a cookie cutter, lay them on buttered baking plates, and bake them a 
few minutes. Frost them as soon as baked, and sprinkle comfits or 
sugar sand on the top. 

Venetian Cake. — This makes a handsome loaf, and is -very good. 
Beat together the yolks of six eggs and half a pint of sugar for 20 
mJnutes. Fold in the stiffly beaten whites and mix in lightly 4^ 
rounded tablespoonfuls of flour. Pour into a buttered mold dusted 
with equal parts of flour and sugar. Bake half an hour, with an increas- 
ing heat, putting it into a moderate oven at first. When done invert it 
on the pastry rack, and when cold frost with a vanilla chocolate icing. 

Walnut Cake. — Cream two-thirds of a cupful of butter with one 
cupful of sugar. Separate three eggs; beat the yolks until creamy and 
add to butter and sugar; then add one cupful of milk alternating with 
three cupfuls of flour (reserve enough of the flour for the nuts), add two 
teaspoonfuls of baking powder, one cupful of nut kernels chopped, and 
last of all fold in the whites of the eggs beaten to a stiff frotih. Bake 
in a loaf tin in a moderate oven from 45 minutes to one hour. 

Walnut Wafers. — One cup brown sugar, one cup chopped nuts, two 
eggs, one tablespoon butter, flour enough to make very thick dough 
(about eight tablespoonfuls), one teaspoon baking powder, vanilla. Beat 
sugar and yolks together, add nuts, butter and flour; lastly the whites 
beaten stiff and baking powder. Drop by one-half teaspoonful on but- 
tered tins, allowing room to spread. Bake in quick oven. 

Whigs. — Mix half a pound of sugar with six ounces of butter, a 
couple of beaten eggs, a teaspoonful of cinnamon. Stir in two pounds 
of flour, a teacup of yeast, and milk sufficient to m.ake a thick batter. 
When light, bake them in small cups. 

White Fruit Cake. — The whites of 16 eggs, one pound each of sugar, 
flour and butter, one grated cocoanut, one pound chopped citron, one 
pound chopped blanched almonds, one wineglass of rose water, two tea- 
spoonfuls of baking powder. Flour citron and almonds well; bake care- 
fully. 



CHAPTER IX. 



EGGS. 



Eggs a la Bonne Femme. — Cut an onion into fine dice, fry it lightly in 
a tablespoonful of butter, then dash in a teaspoonful of vinegar. But- 
ter a shallow dish, sprinkle the fried onion over it, and break in five 
eggs, being very careful that the yolks remain whole. Bake in a hot 
oven until the whites become a delicate film. Dust with salt and white 
pepper. Just before sending to the table sprinkle all over the dish 
coarse bread crumbs fried delicately brown in butter, and garnish with 
watercress or parsley. 

A la Maitre d'Hotel. — Put the eggs in boiling water and boil six 
minutes ; then take from the fire and dip in cold water, taking them 
out immediately; this is to render shelling easy. When shelled, cut the 
eggs through lengthwise and lay them on a hot dish on which maitre 
d'hotel butter has been melted. With a spoon cover the eggs with this 
sauce, which is made as follows : Mix with a spoon on a plate a piece 
of butter the size of an egg with a tablespoonful of finely chopped* par- 
sley, a pinch of salt, and pepper. Put it on a hot platter to melt. This 
sauce is often served with fish, broiled meat or boiled vegetables. It is 
very nice with new potatoes. Eggs boiled as above described are also 
very good with strained tomato, or parsley sauce, while another varia- 
tion is given by using black butter, sauce au beurre noir. To make this, 
brown half a cupful of butter in the frying pan as brown as it can be 
made without burning, then add two tablespoonfuls of vinegar, salt and 
pepper. This sauce is very good with fish also. 

Baked Eggs. — One large cupful of milk, add one teaspoonful of but- 
ter (or more if wished), salt and pepper to taste, one teaspoonful of 
flour, made smooth with a little extra milk. Boil about three minutes 
and pour in heated dish, then break in five fresh eggs and put in hot 
oven and bake until whites of eggs are set. 

Baked Eggs with Cheese.— Cut 12 hard boiled eggs in thick slices, 
nnd, having a buttered baking dish well sprinkled with dry crumbs, place 
a. layer of eggs in the center. Sprinkle with grated cheese and season 
lightly with salt and paprika. Add another layer of eggs and cheese 
until the dish is filled, finishing with the cheese. Pour in a cream sauce 
thickened with the yolks of three eggs, sprinkle with fresh bread crumbs 
mixed with cheese, dot with butter and bake about 10 minutes in a hot 
even, or until the cruiTibf! are a golden yellow. Serve at once. 



no THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Baked Eggs With Mashed Potatoes. — The potatoes should be well sea- 
soned, and beaten smooth with hot cream or milk and butter, so they 
will be very light. Put in a buttered baking dish, and then with a 
small croquette mold (or if this 's lacking, with a clean egg) make 
deep little hollows in the potatoes. Drop an uncooked egg carefully 
into each of these hollows, dust with salt and pepper, and dot the 1;op 
with bits of butter; set in the oven until the eggs are cooked, and serve 
at once. 

Creamed Eggs. — Boil six eggs for about eight minutes. Cool, remove 
shells, and cut into halves. Put two tablespoonfuls of butter in a 
saucepan and blend with the same amount of flour. Add a cup of 
water and stir until smooth. Put in some more butter, season with salt 
and pepper and a little lemon juice. Stir in the eggs and serve on toast. 

Eggs in Cream. — Use very thick cream, a dessert spoonful to each egg 
to cook them in. Put the cream in a large deep granite ware pie dish 
and set on top of the stove for a minute or two, until the cream gets thin. 
Then break in the eggs ; sprinkle a little salt and white pepper over 
each egg, set the dish back on the stove, cover close and let stand two 
or three minutes, or until the eggs are nicely set. These are most de- 
licious served with toast and coffee for breakfast. 

Mexican Eggs. — Peel and chop four or five ripe tomatoes and lay 
them in a shallow vegetable dish or on a platter on which the peppers 
are to be served. Remove the stems and seeds from six or eight very 
tender peppers, and if desired, the skins can be peeled off in this way. 
Put them into a dry frying pan over a moderate fire, moving them 
often until they are sufficiently wilted to allow the removal of the skins. 
This done, put a small bit of cheese in each pepper and return them to 
the pan with a good lump of butter. Fry them gently so the butter will 
not scorch. When done pour three well-beaten eggs slightly salted into 
the pan with the peppers and when set take them up by the spoonful — 
a pepper in each — and lay them on the chopped tomatoes. 

Omelets. — It is always better to make several small omelets than one 
large one, if a number of persons are to be served. It is much more 
likely to turn out well. Nearly everyone has her own special recipe for 
this dish ; the regulation French omelet calls for three eggs well beaten, 
to which three tablespoonfuls of water are added, and stirred in lightly. 
A level tablespoonful of butter is melted in a perfectly smooth frying 
pan and the omelet turned in; it is shaken gently to prevent sticking, 
and when cooked rolled over with a flexible knife and slid on to a hot 
dish. It is varied by putting in a filling before rolling over; half a cup 
of grated cheese is very nice, or some jam or jelly for a sweet omelet, 
which makes a rich dessert. Some cooks stir a little flour into the first 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. Ill 

egg beaten, and separate the eggs, folding in the beaten whites last; 
this makes a very light and puffy omelet. 

Buttermilk Omelet. — Four eggs beaten separately, one cupful of but- 
termilk, one-half teaspoonful of soda, three-quarters cup of finely rolled 
cracker crumbs, a scant teaspoonful of salt, one-eighth of a teaspoonful 
of pepper. Have two tablespoonfuls of butter hot in a frying pan. 
Turn in omelet and fry a delicate brown. Place in oven for 10 minutes 
and when firm fold and serve. 

Fairy Omelet. — Beat yolks and whites of six eggs separately; add five 
tablespoonfuls of milk to the yolks. Heat a skillet and put in a table- 
spoonful of butter; let it melt, pour in the beaten yolks and pile be- 
tween whites on the tcp; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cover and 
cook three minutes, slip out on hot platter and serve by cutting through 
yolks and whites. 

French Omelet. — Beat thoroughly, first, the yolks and then the whites 
of the eggs ; to the yolks add a tablespoonful of boiling water, a pinch 
of salt and a dash of pepper; turn the stiff whites into the yolks and 
fold; that is, stir them in so that the air bubbles shall not be broken. 
Turn carefully into a frying pan, in which has been melted a large 
piece of butter. Set where it may cook very slowly, and when well 
browned on one side set in the oven to brown on the other. Send im- 
mediately to the table. The omelet may be varied by dropping chopped 
meat in it, chopped celery, grated cheese, or, if a sweet omelet is de- 
sired, by spreading jelly over and folding. 

Orange Omelet. — Beat yolks of three eggs ; add three tablespoonfuls 
of sugar and the grated rind of one orange; add a pinch of salt to the 
whites of the eggs and beat until stiff; mix the whites lightly with the 
yolks, sprinkling in at the same time three tablespoonfuls of orange 
juice; melt one teaspoonful of butter in a clean, small frying pan till 
the bottom is greased; turn in the tgg mixture; cook slowly, turning 
the pan that the bottom may brown evenly; when firm on the bottom 
put pan in a hot oven; fold in half and turn out on a hot platter; 
sprinkle over powdered sugar. 

Pannikins. — Take some little earthen pans, such as are sold for toy 
milk pans, capable of holding one egg only; heat them in the oven, and 
when quite hot take them out, and with a paste brush butter them in- 
side; break an Q.gg carefully into each pan; set them into the oven until 
the white of the egg is hard enough to retain the form of the pan; turn 
them out in a circle on the dish in which they are to be served. On the 
top of each sprinkle a little fresh parsley or grated ham; have ready a 
sauce of bread criHnbs beaten up with rich gravy, browned and seasoned; 
place this in the center of the dish, the eggs inclosing it. 



lis THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Canadian Poached Eggs. — A cupful of milk is brought to scalding 
point in a shallow granite vessel, and into this the eggs are gently dropped, 
then covered. The milk is not allowed to boil, merely kept at the scald- 
ing point. The eggs will be ready in about two minutes, with the yolk 
inside of a beautiful pearly film. Lift them out carefully with a skim- 
mer and set each tgg on a slice of buttered, delicately-browned toast. 
Add to the hot milk one tablespoonful of butter and one tablespoonful 
of flour rubbed smooth, season with pepper and celery salt, beat till 
creamy and pour over the poached eggs. 

Poached Eggs in Glasses. — Add a few grains of salt to the white of 
an egg (a level saltspoonful to five eggs) and beat until dry; turn into 
a buttered glass and form a nest on the top for the yolk, which must 
be ftcpt whole. Put the glass on a trivet, or an inverted tin cover, in a 
covered dish of lukewarm water, letting the water come to within half 
an inch of the top of glasses, and let cook until the tgg is set and rises 
in the glass. Do not allow the water which is around the glass to boil. 
Serve at once. Prepare as many eggs in glasses as there are persons 
to be served. Dainty and wholesome for invalids. 

Eggs Poached in Tomato Sauce. — Put into the frying pan one table- 
spoonful of butter, one tablespoonful of flour; heat until frothy; stir 
into it V/z teacupful of tomato (which has been peeled and chopped 
fine and heated) and then strain into the frying pan a dash of cayenne 
pepper and a heaping saltspoonful of salt; cook until creamy, and drop 
in four tggs, baste often, and when whites are set remove and put each 
iigg on a quarter of a slice of buttered toast and pour sauce around 
them. 

St. Pancras Eggs. — Separate the yolks from the whites of five eggs; 
keep each yolk separate; whip the whites to a stiff froth, adding a salt- 
spoonful of salt; butter five small cups, put the whites into them and 
carefully drop the yolk into the center of each ; dust with salt and pep- 
per; place the cups in a shallow pan of hot water, put in the oven and 
bake five minutes, or till the whites are set. Serve in the cups. 

Egg Salad. — Boil six eggs perfectly hard, putting them on in cold 
water and cooking 10 minutes after this reaches the boil, that the yolks 
may be dry and mealy. Cut the whites in two, remove carefully and rub 
the yolks to a paste with three tablespoonfuls of minced ham or chicken 
or both, 10 drops of onion juice, a saltspoonful of mustard, a table- 
spoonful of melted butter, salt to taste and half a teaspoonful of paprika. 
Crowd this mixture back into the halved whites, cutting a bit off the bot- 
tom of each cup, that it may stand upright, and letting the newly formed 
yolk rise above the edge of the white as far as the original yolk would 
have done. Arrange these on lettuce leaves and serve with a French 
dressing or with boiled salad dressing.

Scalloped Eggs.— Boil eight eggs hard ; put in cold water for five 
minutes; then shell and cut into slices with very sharp knife; put a 
layer in small buttered baking dish ; sprinkle with fine bread crumbs. 
salted, a dash of pepper, small dots of butter; fill up dish in this man- 
ner, having the bread crumbs on top with small pieces of butter; have 
ready one cupful of hot milk, into which a teaspoonful of cornstarch 
dissolved in a tablespoonful of milk has been well stirred, and a pinch 
of salt; pour milk over eggs and crumbs; put in a quick oven for 15 
minutes ; serve in baking dish. 

Scrambled Eggs. — Break the required number of eggs in a bowl ; 
beat until the 3'olks are broken. Put a lump of butter the size of a 
walnut in a frying pan; as soon as it is melted turn in the eggs, and 
b\\v until it is set. Serve immediately. A pleasing change is made in 
scrambled eggs by stirring in a little potted meat or finely chopped par- 
sley just before serving, and then sprinkling over the top some hot 
browned bread crumbs. 

Scotch Woodcock. — Make a half-pint of cream sauce, using one and 
one-half tablespoonful of butter, one of flour and a cupful of cream. 
Season with one-fourth of a saltspoonful of white pepper, and a half- 
teaspoonful of Worcestershire sauce. Shell and chop fine five hard- 
boiled eggs, add them to the sauce, cook for three minutes and serve 
on well-buttered rounds of crisp toast. 

Welsh Rabbit. — Half a pound of cheese, two eggs, a speck of ca- 
yenne, a tablespoonful of butter, on teaspoonful of mustard, half tea- 
spoonful of salt, half a cupful of cream or rich milk. Break the cheese 
in small pieces, and put all the ingredients in a double boiler, or in a 
pan over hot water. Stir until the cheese melts ; then spread on toast 
and serve at once. 

Egg Timbales. — Beat four eggs, add to them one cup of milk, half 
teaspoonful salt, and four dashes of pepper. Pour into buttered custard 
cups, set these in a pan of hot water, and cook in a slow oven until the 
timbales are set in the center. Turn out on a hot dish, and pour over 
them a cream sauce made by placing half a pint of milk in a double 
boiler; rub together a rounding tablespoonful each of butter and flour, 
stir this into the boiling milk until it thickens, add half a teaspoonful of 
salt and four dashes of pepper. 

Egg Toast. — Butter a shallow pudding dish, put in it a layer of toast, 
cut into narrow scrips, then a layer of hard-boiled whites of eggs, cut 
into slices, then another layer of toast. Put over this the yolks of the 
hard-boiled eggs, riced by passing through a vegetable press ; then pour 
over all a rich cream sauce highly seasoned, and place in the oven until 
it is well browned. 



CHAPTER X. . 

VEGETABLES. 

Asparagus. — The average cook rarely tries any other mode than boil- 
ing. Boil the stalks whole, after careful washing, tying in a bundle to 
keep from breaking; drain, lay upon toast, and serve with cream sauce. 
Another way is to cut in inch lengths, and stew in milk, thickening with 
flour, and seasoning with butter, pepper and salt. 

Asparagus a la Vinaigrette. — Cook as for boiled asparagus. While 
cooking make a hot French dressing by mixing together in a saucepan 
over the fire six tablespoonfuls of salad oil, two of vinegar, two tea- 
spoonfuls of French mustard, half a teaspoonful of sugar, salt and pep- 
per to taste. When the asparagus is tender drain, put in a deep dish 
and pour over it the hot dressing. Cover and set aside to cool, then 
stand in the ice chest for an hour or so before serving. 

Baked Beans with Cream. — Soak and parboil a pint of navy beans 
until half cooked; drain, dash over a quart of cold water, drain again 
and add the last water (boiling) with two heaping teaspoonfuls of salt, 
one-eighth teaspoonful pepper, one large sprig of thyme (minced), two 
tablespoonfuls of beef drippings or the clean, browned trimmings of fat 
from roast beef, and fried steak may be used instead of the drippings; 
when beans are cooked tender turn all into a covered bean pot and 
bake in a very moderate oven five hours. Then pour over the beans a 
cupful of sweet cream and bake an hour longer. 

Baked Beans and Tomato Sauce. — Prepare the beans as for ordinary 
baking, by soaking and parboiling; then put in a crock, with the pork, 
and add the sauce, which should be prepared while the beans are cook- 
ing. Some cooks merely use the juice from a can of tomatoes; we pre- 
fer to use some of the solid part, too. Stew slowly, put through a sieve 
to make it smooth, and flavor with salt, pepper, a small pinch of clove, 
a little mustard, and, if desired, a shred of onion. Do not thicken; pour 
this over the beans, cover and bake. Add a little' water from time to 
time if the beans seem to be becoming too dry. A little sugar may be 
added to the sauce if the family taste approves. 

String Beans and Bacon. — Cut one or two slices of tender mild-cured 
bacon in tiny cubes and cook to a delicate brown in the frying pan. 
Add a pint of hot cooked and drained string beans and a few drops of 
onion juice. Shake the frying pan thoroughly. Add salt and pepper as 
needed and turn into a hot dish. Peas may be served in the same way. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 115 

Lyonnaise Beets. — Two cupfuls of boiled beets cut into half-inch 
dice, three tablespoonfuls of vinegar, one tablespoonful of butter, one 
tablespoon of chopped parsley, one-fourth of a teaspoonful of salt, half 
the quantity of pepper. Put all of the ingredients except the beets into 
a double boiler. When well heated add the beets, stir for a few min- 
utes that they may absorb the dressing and serve very hot. 

Baked Summer Cabbage. — Cut into quarters and boil tender in salt 
and water two medium-sized heads of cabbage, drain and chop. Ar- 
range an inch layer in the bottom of a baking dish. Sprinkle with black 
pepper, then crumb in a layer of stale bread. Drop small bits of butter 
over the bread crumbs. Repeat the process until the dish is nearly full, 
bread coming on top. Then pour over the whole one pint of rich milk 
or thin cream, and bake until nicely browned. 

Baked Cabbage With Cheese. — Boil a firm white cabbage for 15 min- 
utes in salted water, then change the water for more that is boiling, and 
boil until tender. Drain and when cool chop fine. Butter a baking 
ilish, and lay in the chopped cabbage. Put one tablespoonful of butter 
>n a frying pan; when it bubbles stir in one tablespoonful of flour, one 
half-pint of stock, same of boiling water; stir until smooth. Then 
season with saltspoonful salt, half as much pepper, four tablespoonfuls 
grated cheese. Pour over the cabbage, sprinkle cracker crumbs over the 
top, dot with bits of butter and bake in a quick oven 10 minutes. 

Browned Cabbage. — One small cabbage, one tablespoonful of buttter, 
half a cupful of milk, two eggs and bread crumbs. Cut the cabbage into 
small pieces and remove the hard center. Wash the pieces in cold wa- 
ter ; then pour boiling water over them and let stand for 10 minutes. 
Drain off the hot water and put the cabbage in boiling salted water to 
cook until tender. When it is done pour off the water, pressing down 
hard on the cabbage, to be sure that all the water has been drained away. 
Chop as fine as possible, beat up the eggs, add the milk and stir all the 
ingredients and seasoning with the cabbage. Put the whole into a but- 
tered baking dish and bake for one hour in a moderate oven. 

Red Cabbage, German Style. — Slice red cabbage thin, cover with 
cold water, and let soak 20 minutes ; then drain. Put one quart in a stew 
pan with two tablespoonfuls of butter, one-half teaspoonful of salt, one 
tablespoonful of finely chopped onion and a few gratings each of nut- 
meg and cayenne. Cover, and cook until the cabbage is tender; then 
add two tablespoonfuls of vinegar and one-half tablespoonful of sugar, 
and cook five minutes. 

Carrot Ragout. — Clean and scrape enough new carrots to measure a 
pint ; take the same quantity of new potatoes and white turnips, cutting 
them in pieces about the size of the carrots. Cut a half cupful of leeks 
in fine slices, Cook the carrots in boiling water for half an hour and the 



116 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

other vegetables separately for 10 minutes. In a frying pan brown 
slowly together two tablespoonfuls each of butter or dripping and flour; 
add gradually one pint of stock or water and stir until thick and smooth. 
Season with a level tablespoon! ul of sugar, one teaspoonful of salt and 
one-quarter of a teaspoonful of white pepper, add the vegetables, cover 
and simmef gently for half an hour, and before serving stir into it a 
tablespoonful of parsley. 

Baked Corn. — One quart corn scraped from cob; one and one-third 
cupful cream.; one heaping tablespoonful of butter; season with salt 
and pepper. Bake one hour. 

Baked Corn and Tomatoes. — Fill an earthen pudding dish with alter- 
nate layers of corn and tomatoes, each about an inch thick. Season each 
with salt, pepper and butter. When the dish is full sprinkle with grated 
bread crumbs and bits of butter. Cover the dish with a plate and bake 
in a moderately hot oven for 20 minutes. Then remove the cover and 
bake 15 minutes longer. 

Corn Chowder. — Cut the kernels from a dozen ears of green corn. 
Peel and mince two onions and fry them brown in three tablespoonfuls 
of butter in a deep saucepan. Now put in the corn, four broken pilot 
biscuits, add a half dozen parboiled and sliced potatoes. Season with 
pepper, salt and a tablespoonful of minced parsley, and cover with a 
quart of boilmg water. Let all cook gently for three-quarters of an hour, 
then stir in slowly a cupful of boiling milk, thickened with a tablespoon- 
ful of flour rubbed into one of butter. Turn at once into a heated tureen. 

Escalloped Corn. — Into a buttered dish put a layer of green corn pulp, 
sprinkling with salt and bits of butter. Over this spread a layer of 
cracker crumbs, seasoned and moistened slightly with milk. Fill the dish 
with alternate layers of corn and cracker crumbs, with crackers for top 
layer and plenty of milk over the whole. Cover and bake one hour. 

Hulled Corn. — New England taste demands a well-ripened white flint 
corn for hulling, other sections prefer yellow, but it is always flint corn. 
Babbitt's potash is used to remove the hulls, the proportion being one 
full pound to a bushel of corn. Of course, when preparing corn for 
home use, the same proportion would be observed in smaller quantities. 
An iron kettle half filled with water is put on the stove, the potash added 
when the water warms, and the corn put in when it comes to a boil. In 
about an hour the starch will come out of the corn, thickening the lye. 
The corn must be well stirred from the bottom, to avoid burning, and 
the kettle kept back on the stove, so the corn will simmer without boiling 
hard. After the first hour corn must be dipped out and tested in cold 
water, to see if the hulls slip. If left in the potash too long it becomes 
dark and sodden; if too short, it cannot be cooked tender. About 1^ to 
two hours is the usual time. The corn is theo washed in clear water. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 117 

When made in large quantities a clean, new broom, with about six inches 
of the straw cut off, is used to rub off the hulls; a stiff whisk would 
answer the same purpose with small quantities. A quantity of water will 
be used during this scrubbing, the hulls being poured off with the water. 
Put the corn on to boil in clear water; when it reaches the boiling point 
draw it back, so that it may simmer. It should not be stirred, as this 
makes it mushy. It requires long, slow simmering; when sufficiently 
cooked it may be salted to taste, and drained in a colander. When 
served it is either eaten with milk, or warmed up with butter in a frying 
pan, and served like a vegetable. In the Summer hulled corn would 
ferment very quickl}^, so its manufacture takes place only after hard freez- 
ing has started in the Fall. 

Hulled corn may also be prepared as follows : Wash two quarts of 
shelled corn to remove loose bits ; then place in a large iron kettle with 
two heaping tablespoons of saleratus, cover with cold water, let come 
to a boil slowly and cook about an hour. Remove the kettle from fire, 
drain off the water, then pour the corn, from which the hulls will already 
be loosened, into a large pan of water. Rub the corn between the hands 
to loosen the hulls; after taking off all those partly loosened put it on 
again in warm water, let boil about half an hour, then try to remove 
the rest of the hulls by rubbing as before. After all hulls are removed, 
wash the corn in at least half a dozen clear waters, then put on once 
more in warm water, and when it boils drain and add fresh water. Let 
the corn cook in this last water until tender, salting to taste. If the 
hulls do not come off readily let the corn boil an hour longer, adding a 
teaspoon more saleratus. 

Corn Pudding. — Two coffeecupfuls of green corn pulp, one cupful of 
new milk, three eggs, two heaping tablespoonfuls of butter. Pour one 
pint of the m.ilk over the corn and set on the fire until scalding hot. Beat 
the yolks of the eggs and add the pint of cold milk and half a cupful of 
sugar. Put the butter in the corn over the fire, and then add the milk 
and yolks of eggs and a little salt. Put in a buttered pudding dish and 
bake slowly. Make a meringue of the whites of the eggs and powdered 
sugar and spread over the top when pudding is done, browning slightly. 

Succotash. — Cook one pint of corn pulp in as little water as you can 
without scorching. Put the cobs in a quart of water and boil hard for 
20 minutes ; remove cobs and in this water boil one pint of shelled beans 
until tender; drain and mix with the corn. Add butter the size of a 
walnut, pepper, salt and half a cupful of thick cream, more if liked. 
Serve hot. 

Baked Egg Plant. — Select one that is firm and fresh, peel it and cut 
it into quarters. Let it lie half an hour in salted water. Put it into boil- 
ing water with a teaspoonful of salt. Cook until it can be easily pierced 



118 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

with a fork. While the plant is cooking cut one medium-sized onion 
into small pieces and cover it with salt water. In 10 minutes pour off the 
water and put the chopped onion into a hot pan, with a tablespoonful of 
butter. Cook until it is thoroughly tender and brown. Drain the tgg 
plant in a colander, put into a bowl, stir with a silver fork until it is 
broken up, but not mashed. Mix with it an equal quantity of rolled 
bread crumbs, add the browned onion and one well-beaten tgg. Season 
with a dash of salt, two dashes of pepper, and add a dessertspoonful of 
butter. Put the mixture into a well-buttered earthen dish, bake just 
long enough to be nicely browned. Serve hot in the dish in which it is 
baked. 

Dutch Hutspot. — Boil six carrots with six onions (medium size) one 
hour, or until tender. In another kettle boil six medium-sized potatoes 
until done. Drain all the water from both, put them together, mash them 
well, add one teaspoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful of sugar, one- 
quarter teaspoonful of pepper, one-half cupful of butter and one-half 
cupful of milk or cream. Beat well and serve hot. 

Macaroni and Cheese. — The macaroni is first put into boiling salted 
water and cooked tender — a half hour or less — then it is drained, and 
rinsed with cold water, and cut in convenient pieces. A buttered pudding 
dish is then filled with alternate layers of the macaroni and chopped or 
grated cheese, perhaps a cupful of the cheese to a quart of the cooked 
macaroni. Season with salt and pepper, fill the dish with milk, and cover 
with bread or cracker crumbs mixed with a little melted butter and bake 
in a moderate oven for nearly an hour, or till the macaroni absorbs most 
of the milk. 

Macaroni, Italian Style. — Four tablespoonfuls of butter, one-half 
pound of macaroni, an onion, parsley, herbs, tomato catsup and spice. 
Put in a pan one tablespoonful each of finely-chopped onion, parsley and 
rosemary; fry in bubbling butter until well browned; add four table- 
spoonfuls of tomato catsup, some mixed spice, four tablespoonfuls of 
butter and one quart of boiling water; put in macaroni broken into 
medium-sized pieces ; frequently shake the pan and stew over a slow fire 
until the macaroni is tender. Arrange on a hot dish, pouring the sauce 
over. Sprinkle thickly with grated cheese. 

Okra, Creole Style. — Wash, trim and cut into slices a quart of young, 
tender okra; place in a granite saucepan two teaspoonfuls of butter, a 
medium-sized onion, a medium-sized green pepper, both minced fine; stir 
over the fire until a golden brown, then add three large tomatoes peeled 
and cut into pieces, three tablespoonfuls of Spanish or some hot pepper 
sauce and salt to taste, and the okra. Cover the saucepan and simmer 
gently for half an hour. Turn out on a hot dish and sprinkle over with 
a teaspoonful of minced parsley and serve. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 119 

Baked Onions. — Peel and cut in thick slices large white onions. Par- 
boil in plenty of salted water, drain well, arrange in a buttered baking 
dish, dot with bits of butter and bake until soft and a pale yellow. 
Sprinkle with salt and pepper and cover with a half-inch layer of grated 
crumbs thickly dredged with grated cheese. Return to the oven long 
enough to melt the cheese. 

Escalloped Onions. — Slice some onions and cook in salted water until 
done, drain and put layers of onion and cracker crumbs seasoned with 
salt, pepper and butter in pudding dish; moisten with milk. Bake 20 to 
30 minutes. 

Baked Split Peas. — Rub a large baking dish with onion. Turn into 
this a pint of split peas soaked until soft. Chop a large onion very fine 
and spread over the top of the peas with' pepper and salt. If you have 
left over gravy or stock pour it over the mixture. If not, cover with 
water, spreading over all bacon cut into the thinnest possible slices. Bake 
in the oven for two hours and add a little boiling water if the peas get 
too dry. 

French Fried Potatoes. — Old potatoes are better for this, or the little 
yellowish potatoes that German cooks use for potato salad. These con- 
tain more gluten. Peel very thin and cut in long thin strips lengthwise. 
Let them stand in cold salted water for two or three hours. Drain and 
wipe dry; put into a wire basket and fry in very hot, deep fat until brown. 
Take out and lay on a piece of manila paper to absord the fat; dust with 
salt and serve. Another way to fry potatoes is to put a little olive oil in 
a deep frying pan ; when very hot add sliced cold boiled potatoes. Cover, 
and cook until a golden brown, turning once. Drain, put in a hot vege- 
table dish and sprinkle with salt, pepper and lemon juice. Still another 
way, that the French chef delights in, is to chop cold boiled potatoes, then 
season lightly with salt, pepper and onion juice. Put a couple of table- 
spoonfuls of olive oil or good drippings in the frying pan, turn in the 
potatoes, press into a solid cake and cook slowly until crusty and brown 
on the under side. Turn on to a hot platter, with the brown side upper- 
most. 

Potatoes au Gratin. — Peel and cut into dice half a dozen potatoes, 
crisp in cold water, then drain, and boil until tender. Drain the water 
off, put the potatoes in a baker, season with pepper and salt, stir a table- 
spoonful of butter through the pieces, pour over them half a cup of milk, 
cover the top with grated cheese, bake quickly and serve hot. 

Potato Chowder. — Wash and pare four large potatoes. Cut them 
into small dice. Chop fine one-quarter of a pound of ham and one good- 
sized onion. Slowly fry the ham and onion together until a light brown, 
then in a saucepan put alternate layers of the ham and diced potato, 
seasoning well with salt and pepper. Add one tablespoonful of finely- 



120 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

chopped parsley and one pint of boiling water, cover and simmer slowly 
until the potatoes are tender, which will take about twenty minutes. In 
a second saucepan thicken two cupfuls of milk with one tablespoonful 
of butter, and one tablespoonful of flour, simmer for a moment, add it 
to the chowder and let cook for two minutes longer. 

Potato Dumplings. — Boil six large potatoes and mash, seasoning with 
one-half teaspoonful salt. Place on a board. Add to this one tgg and 
one-half cupful flour; knead into a dough. Roll out into strips, one-half 
inch thick, and cut into inch lengths. Sprinkle the pieces with flour, so 
that they are quite dry. Place enough of the dumplings in a saucepan 
of boiling water to allow them freedom to swim, and allow them to boil 
about eight minutes. Remove the dumplings from the water, with a 
perforated spoon, to a hot frying pan, in which one cupful bread crumbs 
have been browned in about two tablespoonfuls butter. All of the dump- 
lings can be placed in the pan at the same time. They should be stirred 
from time to time, until nicely browned, keeping a small fire under the 
pan. Serve hot. 

German Sour Potatoes. — Boil four good-sized potatoes. When done 
and cold, skin and cut into cubes. Place these in a bowl and add salt 
and pepper to taste. Now mix in another bowl half a pint of. sweet oil 
and four tablespoonfuls of sweet cider vinegar, one good-sized onion, 
grated fine and sprigs of parsley finely chopped. Mix these together well 
and pour over the potatoes. Now place the empty bowl on top of the 
full one and shake up and down until well mixed. Garnish the dish with 
lemon slices, cut in halves. 

Hashed Brown Potatoes. — Cut or chop finely a quart of cold baked 
or boiled potatoes and put them down in a frying pan in which has been 
dissolved a tablespoonful of butter and an equal quantity of tried-out suet 
or beef dripping. Let the potatoes simmer in this and season with pepper 
and salt; have the pan covered. When the potatoes seem rich and moist 
throughout and browned underneath add a sprinkling of finely-minced 
parsley and with a large, flexible knife loosen the potatoes from the bot- 
tom of the pan, turning the sides over toward the middle as in making 
an omelet, and slip them carefully on to the serving dish. For a pint of 
potatoes use half the quantity of butter and drippings. 

Lyonnaise Potatoes. — Put I'yi tablespoonful of butter in a frying pan; 
when melted add a scant tablespoonful of chopped onion; let it slightly 
color, then add two cupfuls of cold boiled potatoes cut into dice. Stir 
until the potato has absorbed all the butter and become slightly browned; 
then sprinkle with salt, pepper and a tablespoonful of chopped parsley. 
Mix well and serve very hot. 

Scalloped Potatoes. — Peel and slice very thin one medium-sized potato 
for each person to be served, and allow the slices to remain in cold water 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 121 

till crisp. Prepare as you would scalloped oysters with cracker crumbs 
and salt and pepper sprinkled over each layer, and small dots of butter. 
Cover the top of the pan with crumbs and carefully pour on sweet milk 
almost to cover without disturbing the cracker crumbs. Bake two hours 
and a half in a steady oven, removing cover from pan during last half 
hour. It is better to use your thickest, heaviest kettle cover or earthen- 
ware pie pan for the first hour in the oven. 

Spaghetti with Brown Sauce. — Put a half pound of spaghetti into 
slightly-salted boiling water. Boil half an hour, drain and pour into a 
buttered granite pan. Pour over it the following brown sauce : Heat 
three tablespoonfuls butter, stir into this two tablespoonfuls flour, stir 
till smooth. Draw to a cooler place on the stove and add gradually one 
cupful. cold water, stirring constantly. Let it boil up, add one r ant tea- 
spoonful salt, one-fourth teaspoonful pepper, one teaspoonful of catsup, 
simmer two or three minutes, pour over spaghetti, set it into the oven 
and let it bake 10 or 15 minutes. 

Squash Puff. — Press dry cooked squash through a sieve; to a half pint 
add two tablespoons of melted butter, quarter of a cup of milk, seasoning 
of salt and pepper, and two beaten o^gg yolks. Mix thoroughly, fold in 
two beaten tgg whites, and turn into a buttered mold, set in a pan of 
hot water and bake in the oven until the center is firm. Serve turned 
from the mold and accompanied by a rich cream sauce made from one 
tablespoon each of flour and butter with a cup of scalded cream or rich 
milk and seasoning of salt, pepper, celery salt and mace. This can be 
baked in individual molds if desired. 

Scalloped Squash. — Two cupfuls of boiled squash run through a 
colander, and then let cool ; two eggs, a tablespoonful of melted butter, 
half a cup of milk; pepper and salt; half a cupful of bread crumbs. Beat 
eggs, butter and milk and squash light ; season ; pour into a buttered bake 
dish, sift crumbs over it and bake, covered, half an hour; then brown 
lightly. 

Stewed Summer Squash. — Wash, pare, cut into pieces after removing 
the seeds, cook in a small quantity of water until tender ; drain and press 
dry, salt slightly and serve on golden-browned toast with a cream dress- 
ing made as follows : Into half a pint of rich milk stir one teaspoonful 
of cornstarch, let boil until slightly thickened, then pour it over the toast 
and squash. 

Sweet Potato, Southern Style. — Peel and boil until they are thoroughly 
but not too well cooked. Then they should be cut into four pieces length- 
wise and placed in a tin baking pan. Butter and sugar should be placed 
over the potatoes abundantly before they are put in the oven to bake 
slowly. After a while, the butter and sugar mingling with the juice of 
the potatoes, forms a delicate crust that should be cooked until it has 



123 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

almost reached the point at which it is candy. Under this crust is a 
thick, rich syrup of the sap of the potatoes, sugar and butter. 

Stuffed Sweet Potatoes. — Select large, fine potatoes of uniform size. 
Bake them soft, taking care that they do not burn. With a sharp knife 
cut a slit lengthwise in each and scrape out the inside, breaking the skin 
as little as possible. Put the pulp into a bowl; work into it a tablespoon- 
ful of butter, enough hot milk to make a soft paste; salt and pepper to 
taste, and a teaspoonful of lemon juice. Beat light, and fill the emptied 
skins with the mixture. Bring the cut edges neatly together, and set the 
potatoes back in the oven to reheat. Serve in a deep dish lined with a 
heated napkin. 

Baked Tomatoes, Italian Style. — Pour two tablespoonfuls of olive oil 
into a baking dish. Add four tablespoonfuls of grated bread crumbs 
that have already been mixed with parsley and other herbs, all of which 
must have been chopped very fine. Season with pepper and salt. Upon 
this bed of oil and crumbs lay a dozen tomatoes that have been cut in 
halves. Cover them with four more tablespoonfuls of bread crumbs that 
have previously been seasoned in the same way. Pour over all two more 
tablespoonfuls of oil and send the dish to a hot oven, where the tomatoes 
must bake for about one hour. 

Panned Tomatoes. — These are excellent served with roast meats. Put 
in a pan with two ounces of butter six firm tomatoes that have been cut 
in halves. Cook slowly on the top of the range for 10 minutes, then 
brown quickly in the oven. Remove the tomatoes to a hot platter, and 
make a sauce by adding to the browned butter two tablespoonfuls of 
flour, and after it is rubbed smooth one pint of milk. Stir until boiling. 
Season well with salt and pepper and pour over the tomatoes. Garnish 
with parsley and points of toast. 

Scallop of Tomatoes and Potatoes. — Season a pint of peeled and 
chopped tomatoes with salt, pepper and onion juice to suit the taste, and 
add enough potatoes to make a cupful when chopped fine. Butter a baking 
dish and sprinkle with bread crumbs and put in half of the tomatoes; 
then a layer of soft crackers, buttered and broken in coarse bits. Cover 
the crackers with two heaping tablespoonfuls of grated American cheese. 
Then add the remainder of the tomatoes, more cracker crumbs and bits 
of butter and place in a hot oven. Bake 20 minutes. Serve at once. 



CHAPTER XI. 

CANNING AND PRESERVING. 

This chapter does not aim to cover the entire ground, but to give 
briefly the experience of other housewives, which may include some in- 
formation not generally found in print. There are still many housewives 
who laboriously can fruit by cooking it in a kettle, and then lifting it 
into the jars; we make preserves in that way, but our canned fruit 
is packed into jars, covered with hot syrup, and then cooked by standing 
the jars in water in a wash boiler. Instead of putting odd pieces .of bbard 
in the bottom of the boiler to rest the jars on, have a board made to fit, 
with three cleats across it underneath and a number of auger holes bored 
in it so that the water passes through. We usually put enough water to 
come half way up the jars, but some housekeepers elevate the jars above 
the water and cover the boiler closely, thus cooking the fruit in the steam. 
Of course there are cooking kettles made for this purpose which are 
more convenient than a wash boiler. 

Fruit is canned without sugar after the following method: Fill the 
jars with fruit; then pour in as much water as they will hold; adjust the 
rubbers; lay the lids carefully on top without fastening them down; stand 
the jars in a wash boiler, the bottom of which has been protected with a 
rack; surround them with cold water; put the lid on the boiler; bring to 
boiling point and boil strawberries, blackberries, raspberries and currants 
for twenty minutes; cherries, for three-quarters of an hour; pineapples, 
for half an hour; peaches and pears, for half an hour. Strawberries and 
raspberries are better without water. Fill the jars with fruit, bring them 
to boiling point, and when the fruit shrinks or settles you may fill two 
jars from a third; put them back in the boiler; cook for five or 10 
minutes longer and then fasten on the lids. Seal the jars. Lift the jars 
one at a time and screw on the lids without lifting them. Wipe the jars, 
put them into a cool place out of the draught. Next morning give each 
lid a turn and store in a cool dark place. 

Canned fruit may also be cooked in the oven. Pack the prepared 
fruit in the jars, fill up with hot syrup, and lay the cover on top of the 
jar without fastening. Place in the oven, setting in a dripping-pan holding 
about two inches of water, or on a strip of asbestos. The oven should be 
moderately hot. Cook the fruit 10 or 15 minutes, dependent again upon 
the fruit, then lift from the oven, one can at a time, fill to overflowing 
with the scalding syrup, running the blade of a silver knife around the 
edge of the can to allow for the escape of all air-bubbles, then wipe and 



124 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

screw as tightly as possible. Set the jars on a thickly folded newspaper, 
out of a draft, until the fruit has cooled, then tighten again. 

The following method is highly recommended for small fruits : Look 
over the fruit carefully, using only that which is perfect. Place in glass 
jars, that are also perfect. Shake down the fruit, but do not press down. 
Have ready enough hot syrup to cover the fruit. Fill the can full of the 
syrup, including the fruit already in. Screw on the cover tightly, and 
drop into a pail of boiling water. Be sure that the water is boiling, and 
that it covers the can well. Remove the pail to the table or some other 
convenient place; when the water is cool, take out the can, screw down 
the cover, if it is not tight, label, wrap in brown paper, and put away in 
the fruit cupboard. 

Some firm fruits, and also rhubarb, may be canned without cooking, 
being packed into the bottle, v/hich is then filled with cold water. The 
jar is filled to overflowing, and any air bubbles removed by running the 
blade of a silver knife down the side ; it is then sealed tightly and stored 
in a cool dark place. 

Try to avoid beet sugar when making jelly. We have never succeeded 
in hardening a fruit jelly made with beet sugar, and many exasperating 
cases of jelly that won't "jell" are due to this cause. Marian Harland 
says that many years ago she v/as advised to use one-fifth more beet sugar 
than a recipe called for when cane sugar was used. 

Almack's Preserves. — This is a foreign recipe. Peel and stone one 
quart of large ripe plums; peel and slice one dozen apples and one dozen 
pears. Arrange in an earthen jar in alternate layers, adding one pound 
of sugar to each pound of fruit. Set on back of range on an asbestos 
mat and simmer slowly until a little when cooled on ice shows it to be 
of such a firm consistency that it can be cut with a knife, for it is to be 
served cut in slices. When sufficiently cooked put away in a shallow jar 
from which it will be easy to cut it out. Seal like jelly, with paraffin 
before covering. 

Preserved Ginger. — Clean and wash some fine green ginger roots, let 
them lie several hours in cold water, drain and place the roots in la 
kettle of boiling water, cook 20 minutes ; drain and rinse off with oold 
water; return the ginger to the kettle, cover with fresh boiling water and 
cook until the ginger is soft; drain and put in cold water. Next day 
drain the roots in a sieve and weigh them; allow for each pound one 
pound of sugar and one-half pint of water ; boil sugar and water five 
minutes, add the ginger, boil a few minutes, remove and pour the ginger 
in a bowl. Twelve hours later drain off the syrup, boil it three minutes 
and pour it over the ginger ; repeat this twice more. Then drain off all 
the syrup, place over the fire, boil to a soft ball, add the ginger, cook two 
minutes and fill into jars.

Canned Baked Apples, — Select good tart cooking apples ; wash, remove 
the blossom end, but do not peel. Arrange in a baking pan with hot 
water to half fill the pan. Sprinkle with sugar, bits of sweet butter, and 
a dash of any spice if desired, and bake until tender. Can while hot, using 
the juice in which they were baked. Stand the jar in hot water 30 
minutes before wanted for use, and you will have perfect baked apples 
for breakfast. Pears canned the same way are fine, or pears with thinly 
sliced quince scattered among them. 

Canned Porter Apples. — Wipe, quarter, core and peel the apples, then 
weigh them. Make a syrup by boiling for 10 minutes one-third the weight 
of the apples in granulated sugar with water, the proportion being 2V2 
cupfuls of water to one pound of sugar. Cook the apples slowly in the 
syrup until soft; do not crowd them. Skim out the apples carefully into 
jars, cover with the boiling syrup, and seal. 

Apple Ginger. — Tie a little ginger root in a bag. A quarter of a pound 
will do for eight pounds of apples. Put the bag of ginger into three 
pints of cold, clear water. When the water is highly flavored add about 
three-quarters of a pound of sugar to every pound of apples. The three 
pints of water will be sufficient for six pounds of sugar. Add the juice 
of two lemons, laying aside the yellow peel cut in shreds. Clarify the 
syrup by allowing it to cool after it has cooked five minutes and mixing 
the white of two eggs and the shells in the cooled syrup. Return the 
syrup to the fire, let it boil up once, and then draw to the back of the 
stove. A scum will cover it. Strain into a clean saucepan, add the 
yellow peel of the lemons and put in quarters of apples. As soon as 
cooked, lift them out and put in more. Place the apples into jars and 
pour the syrup over them. 

Apple Orange Marmalade. — Core and slice 20 large tart apples. Allow 
for every quart one pint of water. Add the thin peel of one orange, cover 
and boil until tender. Place a sieve over a bowl, pour in the apples and 
let drain without disturbing. Allow for each pint one pound of sugar. 
Peel four large oranges, remove white part and seeds and set aside. Boil 
apple juice till very thick, add orange cut into small pieces and cook until 
a drop retains its shape on a plate. Put in glass jars and cover like 
jelly. The apple pulp may be used in pies. 

Preserved Apples. — Pare and core fine, ripe pippins, and cut them into 
quarters. Weight and to each pound allow one pound of granulated sugar 
and a half pint of boiling water, the grated rind of one and the juice of 
two lemons. Boil the sugar and water until clear (about three minutes), 
skimming the scum from the surface, add the juice and rind of the lemons, 
then the apples, and simmer gently until they are clear and tender, but 
not broken, then stand aside to cool. When cold, put them into jars, cover 



126 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

closely and stand in a cool, dark place for one week. At the end of that 
time turn them carefully into the kettle, bring them to boiling point, and 
simmer for five minutes, then return them to the jars, cover closely with 
tissue paper brushed over with the white of an egg, and put in a dark, 
cool place to keep. Apples are more difficult to keep than any other fruit. 

Blackberry cheese is an old-fashioned but excellent recipe. Three pounds 
apples, peeled and cored ; three pounds blackberries. To each pound pulp 
allow three-quarters pound sugar. Peel, core and slice the apples, put 
them in a jar with the blackberries, which must be picked over, and let 
them remain in the oven for three-quarters of an hour, or till the fruit 
is quite soft; pulp through a sieve, and to every pound of pulp allow 
three-quarters of a pound of sugar; boil the pulp for another hour; put 
into jars very hot, and when, cold cover in the usual way. It should be 
firm enough to slice when turned out. 

Barberry Jam. — Pick three pounds of barberries from the stalk, put 
them in a jar or farina boiler, with three pounds of sugar. Stand the jar 
in a saucepan of boiling water, and simmer gently until the sugar is 
dissolved and berries soft, then stand aside all night. In the morning 
put them in a porcelain-lined kettle, and simmer slowly for 25 minutes, 
stirring continually. Turn into glasses and seal when cool, like jelly. 

Barberry Preserves. — This is a very old-fashioned recipe. Four quarts 
of barberries picked from the stems, washed and drained. Heat one large 
quart of molasses and one quart of white sugar together until the sugar 
is dissolved. Skim, and then add the barberries. Cook until they begin 
to pop and shrivel, which will be in about 10 minutes. Skim them into a 
stone jar, then boil the syrup slowly until it will cover the berries. 

Bar le Due Preserves. — Take selected red (or white) currants of large 
size, one by one, carefully make an incision in the skin, one-fourth an 
inch in size, with tiny embroidery scissors. Through this slit, with a 
sharp needle, remove the seeds, separately, preserving the shape of the 
fruit. Take the weight of the currants in strained honey and, when hot, 
add the currants. Let simmer a minute or two, then seal as jelly. The 
currants retain their shape, are of a beautiful color and melt in the 
mouth. Should the currants liquefy the honey too much, carefully skim 
them out, reduce the syrup at a gentle simmer to desired consistency and 
store as before after adding the fruit. 

Black Currants. — Gather the currants on a dry day; to every pound 
allow half a pint red currant juice and a pound and a half of finely 
pounded loaf sugar. Clip off the heads and stalks; put the juice, currants 
and sugar in a preserving pan; shake it frequently till it boils; carefully 
remove the fruit from the sides of the pan, and take off the scum as it 
rises; let it boil for 10 or 15 minutes. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 127 

Blueberry j\Iixtures. — A combination of blueberries and gooseberries, 
one portion of gooseberries to three of the blueberries, canned in the 
ordinary fashion, makes an excellent Winter sauce or filling for pies. So 
does a combination of blueberries and rhubarb, one cupful of rhubarb 
and one cupful of sugar to a quart of blueberries. 

Cherry Conserve. — Five quarts cherries (sour), one pound raisins 
(seeded and cut) ; two oranges (pulp cut in pieces, also yellow of skin) ; 
one pound English walnuts (chopped) ; 2J'2 pounds sugar. Cook until 
thick and put in jelly tumblers. Cherries must be boiled about 20 minutes 
before putting in sugar, etc. 

Cherry Conserve No. 2. — Three pounds sour cherries; two pounds 
raisins; four pounds granulated sugar; four large oranges. Seed and 
steam the raisins for half an hour. Grate some of the orange peel in the 
cherries. Do not use the orange skin. Cut the pulp into small pieces. 
Mix all the ingredients together, boil for 20 minutes, put in glasses. 

Cherry Preserve, Sun-cooked. — Pit the cherries, which must be perfect 
ripe fruit, weigh, and put in a preserving kettle, allowing three-quarters of 
a pound of sugar to each pound of fruit. Do not add any water; the 
juice and sugar make the syrup. Bring to a boil, and boil for 20 minutes, 
stirring to avoid burning and skimming to keep clear. Skim out the 
fruit, putting on shallow platters, pour the syrup over, and cover with 
clean panes of glass. Put the platters out in the sun, and keep outdoors 
three days, bringing in at night. Then put in jars, like any other pre- 
serve. The sun cooks the syrup to a honey-like consistence, and the flavor 
is delicious. Strawberries cooked the same way have all the rich frag- 
rance of the fresh fruit. 

Citron Preserves. — Pare and core the citron, cut into strips and notch 
the edges, or cut into fancy shapes. Allow a pound of sugar to a pound 
of fruit, and to six pounds of the fruit allow four lemons and a quarter 
of a pound of ginger root. Tie the ginger root in a cloth and boil it in a 
quart and a half of water until the flavor is extracted; then remove it and 
add to the water the sugar and the juice of the lemons. Stir until the 
sugar is dissolved and the syrup is clear, remove any scum that may form, 
then add the citron and cook until it is clear, but not soft enough to fall 
apart; can and seal while hot. 

Citron Preserves No. 2.— Cut the citron in strips half an inch wide, 
pare off the rind as thin as possible and cut up the fruit in small squares., 
Put in a vessel and cover the fruit with water in which has been dis- 
solved an ounce of alum to the gallon of water. Soak 24 hours, or until 
the citron is clarified. Take out of alum water and soak in clear water 
until the alum is all out, which will probably be in 12 hours. Weigh and 
allow to each pound of fruit a pound of sugar. Put the fruit in a pre- 
serving kettle with only a little sugar, adding sugar several times until 



128 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

the weighed amount has been used. Season with any flavoring preferred. 
Cook rapidly until done, put in glass cans and seal. 

Citron Preserves No. 3. — Pare a large citron, cut into thin slices, and 
then into strips or squares, removing all seeds. Weigh equal quantities of 
fruit and sugar, mix together, and stand over night in a large bowl ; the 
sugar draws out juice, forming a syrup. In the morning put in a pre- 
serving kettle, and boil slowly for two to three hours, skimming carefully, 
until the syrup is like honey. About 15 minutes before taking from the 
stove add, for each quart of preserves, one lemon cut in very thin slices, 
and one small piece of green ginger root. Some housekeepers add a few 
whole cloves, but we do not care for this. Another method puts the 
sliced fruit to soak in brine for a few hours, then in clear water to freshen 
it, this process hardening the fruit, but we have never used this process, 
and are quite satisfied with the first recipe given. 

Dried Citron. — To prepare citron for cakes and pies cut the fruit in 
four parts, pare and remove the seeds; then take a couple of quarts of 
clear water, dissolve a piece of alum the size of a hickorynut in the 
water, put in the preserving kettle as much citron as the water will cover 
and boil until tender enough to pierce with a straw; then boil in sugar; 
a pint bowl of sugar to the same measure of fruit. Boil one-half hour. 
Spread it on pie plates and set it in a cool oven or heater and let it dry 
perfectly. 

Preserved Crab Apples. — The apples should be very ripe. Wash them 
well in cold water; put them into a porcelain-lined kettle and just cover 
with boiling water. Let them cook very gently until you can remove the 
skins easily. Drain them, peel and carefully remove the cores, but do not 
break the apples or remove the stems. Weigh them, allowing one and 
one-quarter pound of sugar to a pound of fruit; allow a cupful of water 
to this quantity of sugar. Put water and sugar over the fire and bring to 
boiling point. Skim until clear, then put in the apples and cook very 
gently until they are tender and transparent. Skim while cooking. When 
they are done put them into small, large-mouthed jars, and when cool 
seal same as jelly. 

Currants, Canning. — Wash the currants, being careful not to break 
them; remove stems, and pack currants into quart cans, shaking them 
down well. To each can add one cup hot sugar, .place the jars on a 
wooden frame in the boiler, place the covers loosely on the cans, and put 
enough of cold water in the boiler, so when it begins to boil it will not 
boil into the cans. After the water has boiled for half an hour, the cans 
should be lifted out, the covers screwed on tight and put in a cool, dark 
place until wanted for the table. For those that like mixed fruits, a layer 
of strawberries or raspberries and then a layer of currants may be packed 
in the cans. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 129 

Currant Conserve. — Five pcunds currants; four pounds sugar; one 
pound seeded raisins; four oranges. Grate rind and squeeze out juice of 
oranges. Boil all together half hour. Put in jelly glasses. 

Currant Sauce. — Five pounds of currants, heat in preserving kettle, put 
in a muslin bag and squeeze out all juice. Add five pounds granulated 
sugar, one pound raisins, seeded and chopped fine, two oranges, chopped 
fine. Boil till like jelly. The sender of this recipe does up currants with- 
out cooking. Occasionally she says a can spoils, but on the whole she has 
good luck, every can keeping perfectly some years. The currants are 
looked over carefully, washed and then mashed thoroughly, a glass bottle 
being good for this purpose. She then adds sugar, pound for pound. The 
fruit is sealed in cans, using new rubbers each time. Pineapples are also 
put up in somewhat the same way. IMrs. C.'s way is to chop the fruit 
fine, add sugar pound for pound. The fruit thus prepared is left in a 
gallon crock for two days, its contents being stirred frequently with a 
silver spoon. At the end of the second day the fruit is put in air- 
tight cans. 

Cranberry and Apple Jam. — Take two pounds of cranberries and two 
pounds of apples after they are peeled, cored and chopped. Put them in 
a preserving pan with V/2 pounds of sugar. When it comes to the boil 
keep the preserve boiling for half an hour, then try a little on a cold 
saucer, and if on cooling it sets well it will be sufficiently done. Tie down 
in small jars. This makes a delicious preserve, the cranberries imparting 
a fine flavor and giving in addition a brilliant color. 

Damson Cheese. — Boil the fruit, with only enough water to prevent 
burning, until tender; rub through a hair sieve until like a paste, add six 
ounces of sugar to each pound of fruit, stir off the fire until the sugar is 
dissolved, then add four chopped kernels from the fruit to each quart, and 
put back to boil. It is wise to put an asbestos mat under the preserving 
kettle, as the fruit will catch and burn very easily. Boil, stirring con- 
tinually, until the preserve will leave the pan quite dry and adhere in a 
mass to the spoon. Press into jelly glasses, and when cold cover with 
paraffin before sealing. When served, the damson cheese is turned out 
of the glass, and cut in thin slices. 

Elderberries. — These may be combined with gooseberries, crab apples 
and green grapes, equal parts of either, making a piquant table sauce, 
while pies made from them might please the individual who does not 
care for the flavor of the single fruit. For Winter use elderberries may 
be preserved in either of the above combinations and treated as other fruit, 
or canned plain without sugar for use in pies only. When making pies 
from the plain canned fruit it is wise to cook the berries with the same 
proportion of sugar, flour, etc., as given for fresh berries, filling the pie 
paste when cold. This insures a jelly-like consistency of the finished 



130 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

product without those unpalatable doughy lumps too often seen. Again 
they may be spiced and used as a table sauce or in pies, using the same 
proportion. 

Pickled Elderberries for Pies. — Seven pounds elderberries, stemmed, 
four pounds sugar, one pint vinegar, two tablespoonfuls cinnamon, one 
tablespoon cloves. Boil until the juice is rather thick. They will keep 
in an open jar. 

Preserved Elderberries. — Seven pounds of elderberries, three pounds of 
granulated sugar, three lemons sliced thin; put the elderberries alone in a 
stone jar in warm salt and water over night. Next morning drain them 
in a colander, make syrup of the sugar and lemons and one pint of water, 
then put elderberries in the syrup and cook. When they begin to boil 
hard time them 20 minutes, then pour in a jar or can ready for use. 

Preserved Elderberries No. 2. — Shell berries. To an eight-quart panful 
use a heaping tablespoon of salt, pour on hot water and let stand half 
an hour; drain well. To seven pounds of berries thus prepared, use three 
pounds of sugar and one pint of vinegar; boil well. If one wish to keep 
in jars without sealing they should be boiled down thoroughly. For pies 
add a little sugar and flour enough slightly to thicken the juice. 

Spiced Elderberries. — Nine pounds cleaned elderberries, three pounds 
brown sugar, one pint vinegar and one ounce each of cloves, cinnamon 
and allspice. Put sugar and vinegar in a two-gallon granite kettle over 
a slow fire and let come to a boil. Add berries and let simmer two and a 
half hours. Tie spices in little muslin bags and add when nearly done. 
Seal in air-tight cans. 

Preserved Figs. — Take fresh, ripe figs, cut off half the stem of each 
and let soak all night in very weak brine, using two tablespoonfuls of 
salt to each quart of water. In the morning drain and cover with fresh 
water. Make a thick' syrup, allowing three-quarters of a pound of sugar 
to each pound of fruit, and one-half cupful of water to each pound of 
sugar. Simmer for a few minutes until the syrup is clear, then drain 
and lay in it the freshened figs and simmer slowly until they look clear. 
Into each jar drop a half-inch piece of green ginger and the kernels of 
half a dozen peach stones, fill with fruit and syrup and seal. They should 
not be used for at least three months. 

Garfield Butter. — Use two-thirds plums and one-third peaches. Stone 
the plums and pare and stone the peaches. Mash and heat slowly to boil- 
ing, boil until soft, then rub through a sieve. Measure the pulp thus 
obtained and to one measure of fruit add three-quarters of a measure 
of sugar. Boil until thick, stirring continually, then put into jars and seal. 

Canned Grapes. — After picking ripe grapes from the stem, wash them. 
Remove the skins, keeping them and the pulps separate. Cook the pulps 
until the seeds begin to separate. Run through a colander or coarse sieve 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 131 

to remove the seeds. Add the skins to the pulp, cooking till tender. Allow 
one-half pound of sugar to each pound of fruit. 

Gooseberries with Currant Juice. — The tops and tails being removed 
from the gooseberries, allow an equal quantity of finely-pounded loaf sugar 
and put a layer of each alternately into a large, deep jar; pour into it as 
much dripped red currant juice as will dissolve the sugar, adding its 
weight in sugar. The next day put all in a preserving pan, boil it, and 
put up as other jams. 

Grape I\larmalade. — Choose ripe grapes of any familiar kind, and place 
them in the preserving kettle with just enough water to prevent their 
burning. Cook slowly at the side of the stove until they are well broken 
and mashed. Then press through a sieve and measure the pulp. For 
each pint allow half a pound of sugar. Place the grape pulp over the 
fire, boil for 20 minutes, add the sugar and boil from 10 to 20 minutes 
longer, or until a drop of the mixture when put on a plate will retain its 
shape without spreading. Stir constantly while cooking. Skim carefully 
from time to time and when done pack in small jars. 

Grape and Apple Marmalade. — Many people do not care for the flavor 
of the Clinton grape, but it is excellent to use with sweet apples in mar- 
malade, following a New England recipe, in which the wild frost grape is 
ordinarily used. Heat four pounds of stemmed and pulped grapes until 
the seeds are free of pulp. Have four pounds of sweet apples pared, cored, 
sliced and steamed until tender. Sift the grape pulp, add the apples, turn 
into a kettle set on asbestos mat or back of range and simmer slowly for 
two hours; measure, add sugar in the proportion of three-quarters of a. 
pound to a pint of pulp, and cook until a little, chilled on ice, shows that 
it is stiff enough to retain its shape. Turn into jelly glasses and seal. 

Grape Preserves. — Press the pulp out of each grape; boil the pulps 
until tender, then press through colander to remove the seeds; mix the 
skins with the pulp and juice; add as many cupfuls of sugar as there are 
of grapes and boil together until thickened. Green grapes are preserved 
by cutting each grape in halves, taking out the seeds, then adding an equal 
quantity of sugar and boiling all together until the right consistency; seal 
while hot. 

Spiced Grapes. — Press the skins from the grapes and put the pulp 
through the colander; add the skins and weigh. To every pound of 
grapes add one cupful of vinegar, two ounces of powdered cinnamon, one 
ounce of powdered cloves and three and a half pounds of sugar; boil an 
hour and a half until thick, then bottle. Small Damson plums are very- 
nice prepared in the same way. 

Marmalades. — One simple process will serve for all kinds of marma- 
lade, and that is to cook the fruit in its own juice to a state of collapse. 
Then press through a colander, measure, bring to a boil, and skim, before 



122 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

adding the sugar — measure for measure. Cook with care after the sugar 
scum begins to thicken. When the juice rolls up a jelly on a cold silver 
spoon, the marmalade is ready for pint can, or for glasses, covered when 
cold with one-fourth inch, at the least, of hot paraffin. All the small fruits 
make delicious marmalades when pressed through a fine colander or sieve 
to remove the seeds. Grapes and blackberries do not require full measure 
for measure of sugar. Plums are easily converted into a palatable mar- 
malade after removing the pits, but they are more easily made into pre- 
serves, the same as peaches, and quinces ; both are too good for marma- 
lades. By the following method clingstone peaches can be utilized, 'also 
imperfect pears and quinces. Pare the peaches and cut into pieces as 
small as^a cherry, pack into a measuring dish and note the amount. Add 
water to prevent burning and cook thoroughly before adding the sugar — 
measure for measure. Boil with care the same as for marmalade, and 
place in airtight cans. 

Pineapple Marmalade. — Use thoroughly ripe pineapples, peel them, and 
after removing the hard core, chop them. To each pound of fruit and 
juice, add a pound of sugar, and simmer one hour. Frequent skimming 
and stirring will be necessary. Cool some of it, and if not thick enough, 
continue the boiling half an hour longer. An asbestos cover slipped under 
the kettle is a safeguard against scorching. Crab-apple and plum marma- 
lade is excellent. Use the Siberian crab-apples and Bradshaw or other 
violet red plums. Allow two parts apples to one part plums. Wash the 
fruit and cut out the imperfections. Simmer both kinds until soft, then 
rub through a sieve. Allow a pound of sugar to each pint of fruit puip. 
Put the sugar in the oven to heat, and cook the fruit 20 minutes in a 
porcelain-lined or agate kettle. Add the hot sugar, skim, and cook 30 
minutes longer. Stir very often. 

Peach Marmalade. — Use firm late peaches. Peel the peaches and cut 
them in halves. Crack two-thirds of the kernels, blanch them, and cut 
into lengthwise strips. Put the peaches over the fire with three-fourths 
of a pound of sugar to each pound of fruit. Stir frequently and cook 
from 20 minutes to half an hour. Five minutes before removing from 
the fire add the blanched kernels. 

Quince Marmalade. — Rub the fruit with a cloth, cut out the flower end, 
and chop without removing the skins and cores. Cook until soft enough 
to rub through a sieve. Strain the fruit and add three-quarters pound of 
sugar to a pound of fruit. Cook slowly until done, which should be in 
15 or 20 minutes. Apple marmalade affords a change from cider apple 
sauce and stewed apples. Take seven pounds of apples (Fall Pippins are 
nice) and stew them whh a pint of water. Put them through a sieve, 
add three-quarters pound of sugar to a pound of pulp, also the juice 
and grated yellow rind of three lemons. Boil half hour, then add a little 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 133 

ginger root. This may be made of one-third quince and two-thirds apples, 
leaving out the ginger and lemons. 

]Mixed }klarmalade. — Take equal quantities of peaches, apples, pears 
and quinces that have been pared, cored and cut in eighths. Cook quinces 
in water to cover until almost tender. Drain and measure the water. 
For six pounds of mixed fruit there should be one pint of water. Add 
quinces to the other fruit, place in preserve kettle with water, and let 
them cook thoroughly, but not burn. Take out and mash well together. 
Measure. Clean the kettle and put them back with half their weight in 
granulated sugar. Let ihem cook very slowly two hours. Keep them 
stirred well from the bottom and protect with an asbestos mat or set the 
kettle in anolher containing boiling water, as on no account must the jam 
burn. Seal in small jars. 

Orange and Apple Marmalade. — Cut the apples in small pieres with- 
out peeling them and add a pint of water for every quart of appK^s. Boil 
them down for half an hour and strain through a sieve. Add the juice 
and pulp of three oranges and a little of the yellow peel cut fine to every 
pmt of apple pulp. To each pint of the mixture, add three-fourths of a 
pound of sugar. Boil the marmalade until it curls before the finger when 
ii is cooled for trial. 

Preserved Melon Rind. — Pare the melon very thin; do not pare away 
all the ripened melon. Leave about one-quarter inch attached to the rind. 
Cut in pieces and place in a crock over night with salt sprinkled between 
the layers. In the morning drain, pour boiling water over, leave for 
one-half hour, drain agam. New weigh the fruit — to 10 pounds fruit add 
five pounds granulated sugar, one-half gallon white vinegar, one ounce 
stick cinnamon, one ounce white ginger root, and one-half ounce whole 
cloves. Tie the spice in small muslin bags, place all in a large pan and 
boil slowly. The longer it boils the nicer will it be. 

Milk, Canning. — A correspondent tells us she has canned milk in this 
way and kept it a year: Allow the milk to become perfectly cold, then 
fill sterilized fruit jars to within a half inch of the top; put on the 
covers loosely and set into a clean boiier en a board with "holes through ; 
fill boiler with cold water to within an inch of the tops of the jars ; bring 
the water to the boiling point and allow it to boil 20 minutes after ebulli- 
tion begins, then remove the cans one by one, put on new rubbers, fill 
with boiling milk, screw the covers on and invert the cans till cold. Pit 
away in a cool, dark place a.nd use when the cows have dried up. Of 
course this will taste like scalded milk, but for all purposes except drink- 
ing it is all right. As the cream does not dry, it can readily be mixed 
with the milk if desired. If directions are followed carefully and every- 
thing used made perfectly clean little or none will spoil. It is quite 



134 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

essential to use new rubber rings, as old ones become hard and will not 
make the jars tight. 

Or-ra-cur. — Five pounds of currants, five pounds of sugar, juice and 
grated rinds of three oranges, one pound of raisins, chopped and stoned ; 
boil all together for 20 minutes, and put away in jelly glasses. 

Peach Butter. — This is a nice way to use up peaches that arc too ripe 
for canning or pickling. Pare ripe peaches, put in a kettle with sufficient 
water to cover peaches ; when soft run through a colander, the stones 
being thus easily removed. To each quart of peaches thus prepared -add 
1/4 pound of granulated sugar. Boil slowly till thick; add ground cinna- 
mon to taste. This, like all butters and marmalades, requires constant 
watching to keep the fruit from burning. • 

Spiced Peaches. — Weigh eight pounds of freestone peaches after they 
have been peeled, halved and the stones taken out. Put peaches in a por- 
celain lined kettle with one pint of vinegar and five pounds of sugar 
(granulated). Mix one ounce each of cinnamon sticks, whole mace 
and green ginger and one-half ounce of whole cloves. Divide into eight 
parts, tie each in a piece of cheesecloth and drop in the kettle with the 
peaches. Simmer until the fruit is tender, then lift it with a skimmer 
and put it in sterilized jars. Boil the syrup a minute, skim, lift out the 
bags, then pour over the fruit in the jars. It is an improvement to break 
IS peach stones, blanch the kernels in boiling water and add them to 
the syrup just before pouring it into the jars. 

Peach Jam. — Pare, stone and cut into thin slices half a peck of free- 
stone peaches. Weigh. To each pound of fruit add three-quarters of a 
pound of granulated sugar. Put in layers in a preserve kettle and let 
them cook gently until clear, which will probably take an hour. Have 
ready cracked one-third the peach stones, remove and blanch the kernels, 
then slice them thin and sprinkle them among the layers of peaches so ail 
can cook together. Put into small glass jars or tumblers when cold. 
Shut up air-tight. 

Peach Leather. — Pare fully ripe peaches (yellow ones preferred) ; 
remove the pits- and weigh. To each pound of fruit add one-fourth pound 
of granulated sugar. Put in stew kettle and cook slowly, mashing the 
fruit as it boils. When cooked to a thick paste spread on a buttered 
board and put in the sun to dry. Put out the second day and when dry 
enough that it will not stick, loll up like a roll of leather and keep in a 
cool, dry place. Slice from the end of the roll. 

Pears in Cider.— One of our friends reports that Kieffer pears are 
delicious canned in sweet cider. The customary syrup is made by melt 
ing sugar in the cider, and the pears are cooked in this (not over-cooked) 
either in the jars or in a kettle. The cider is said to give much richness 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 135 

of flavor. Pears were also canned in perry (pear cider), but the result 
was not considered so desirable as where the apple juice was used. 

Pear Chips. — Four pounds of Duchess or other hard pears sliced thin, 
four pounds of sugar, the juice of three lemons and grated rind of one, 
one ounce of dry or green ginger root chopped fine and one-half tumbler 
of water. Cook until clear, then seal in jelly glasses. 

Pear Syrup. — Very nice syrup may be made from pears, core and 
pare them; cover with cold water and set on back of stove, let simmer 
until soft, then dip off juice carefully or strain through a colander. If 
the juice is not clear strain through a fine strainer. Return to the fire 
and boil down rapidly to about one-quarter, then add sugar, about as for 
jelly, a cupful of sugar to a cupful of juice. Boil until the syrup is thick 
as you wish and put in glass jars. This, when properly made, is thought 
to be as nice as maple syrup. The flavor may be varied a little by using 
a verj-- little lemon juice or green ginger. If desirable, the cooked pears 
may be used by boiling them a short time with a little sugar, or with 
sugar and vinegar. 

Persimmon Figs. — Gather them, and press each fruit between thumb 
and finger, and put in layers in an open-mouthed jar with a thin layer of 
sugar between the layers of fruit and sugar on the top. After a few 
weeks, say three or four, lay on a platter or plate in single layers and 
dry in a very cool oven or in the sun. 

Canned Plums Without Cooking. — This recipe comes from the plum 
belt of central New York, and will be found very satisfactory: Take 
enough large yellow egg plums to fill a quart can. Put them into a 
granite or earthen pan and pour boiling water over them, let stand three 
minutes, then drain. Pour over more boiling water, which will crack 
the skins. Remove the skins, and place the plums carefully in a hot 
sterilized glass jar. Have ready a thick syrup made by boiling two 
cupfuls of granulated sugar that has been moistened with water, and 
cooked to the "brittle stage." Pour the boiling syrup over the plums and 
seal. The syrup will form like "icicles," but after a day or two will 
dissolve. Make enough syrup for two or three cans at once, as it is 
hard to tell just how much it will take to fill a can. They always keep 
perfectly, and retain their flavor much better than when cooked, but the 
secret is in having everything boiling hot. 

Plum Cheese. — For economy make this on the same day you make 
plum jelly. After extracting the jelly juice .pass the remaining pulp 
through a colander to remove skins and pits, then weigh. Add a pound 
of sugar to every two pounds of plums and boil one-half an hour; seal up. 

Plums in Cold Water. — A housekeeper who has had experience with 
the cold-water' process of keeping fruit says she has kept wild plums 
all Winter in this way, putting them in a large stone jar and covering 



136 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

them with enough cold water to leave about four inches over them. A 
saucer or plate with a weight on it must be placed on top of the fruit 
to keep the top layers deep enough under the water. To make sauce 
from wild plums kept in this way, take cut as many of the fruit as ar^ 
required, and parboil until the skins crack in water containing a pinch 
of baking soda. Then rinse well in clear cold water, drop into boiling 
syrup, and cook until done. This makes a delicious sauce; the parboiling 
with the soda takes the "pucker" out of the fruit. Cranberries will keep 
for months if covered with cold water as described, and m.any house- 
keepers put up green currants and gooseberries, also rhubarb, in the same 
way. 

Plum Conserve. — Five pounds plums, peeled and pitted ; five pounds 
sugar; cook plums 20 minutes before adding sugar. Put in sugar and 
boil a little, then add two pounds seeded raisins (cut into small pieces), 
grated rind of four oranges and the pulp chipped (easier to cut with 
scissors). Cook to a thick conserve (15 to 20 minutes), and put in jelly 
glasses. Cherries (sour) are good used instead of plums; pit them. 
Currants may also be used instead of plums. 

Pineapple and Plum Jam. — Twelve pounds of large plums, five krge 
pineapples, one quart of warcr and sugar in the proportion of three- 
quarters of a pound to every pound of fruit, and one pound to every pint 
of water. Peel and pit the plums, add the water, bring to the boiling 
point, add the pineapple cut in dice and boil until soft and thick, then 
add the sugar and cook three-quarters of an hour longer. 

Spiced Plums. — Spiced plums arc the best of relishes with game, poul 
try, and mutton. Wash, drain, pick snd weigh the plums, prick the skins 
light!}', then pack them down in earthen jars with one-half their own 
weigh of sugar. Strew through the fruit while packing plenty of whole 
cloves, whole allspice, mace, ginger slightly bruised and stick cinnamon. 
Put in also a few whole black peppercorns, and to each jar allot a single 
pod of the small red pepper. Take half a pint of cider vinegar for each 
pound of fruit, add to it as much sugar as the fruit was packed in, bring 
to a boil, skim well and pour over it scalding hot. Let stand 24 hours, 
t'len drain off the syrup, boil up, skim and return to the fruit. Do this 
three times, then put fruit and syrup together in the kettle, let them boil 
five minutes, skimming well, fill jars and cover. 

Canned Pumpkin. — This will supply pie material when stored pump- 
kins are gone. Cook the. pumpkin and strain it, just as you do for pies, 
being careful not to liave much water in it. Fill the can full. Shake 
down so as to have them :>olid. Put on the tops, screw down just a 
little, so you can lift by them, place in boiler, with something between 
the cans and boiler on the bottom, fill to the neck of cans with water 
and boil one good hour. Take out and wipe the necks of the cans, and 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 137 

it the pumpkin has shrunk away, hll cans up with boiling water, put on 
rhigs and screw down the tops tight, and the pumpkin will keep six 
months in a good, cool place. 

Quince Butter. — Use half a gallon of quinces pared and cored, half 
a gallon of tart apples pared and cored, two quarts of sweet cider, one 
pint of cold water. Cover the crock and stew gently until the fruit is 
very soft; then pass tlirough a sieve. Add five cupfuls of sugar and 
cook until soft. 

Canned Quinces. — Prepare the quinces by paring, coring and quarter- 
ing. Use a silver knife. Keep the prepared quinces in cold water to 
prevent them from discoloring until sufficient have been prepared. Cook 
the quinces in boi'ing water slowdy till tender. Have ready a syrup of 
one-half pound of sugar and a pint of water to each pound of fruit. Put 
tlie cocked quinces in the syrup, allowing them to remain five minutes. 
Then can and seal while hot. 

Quince Honey. — One medium quince and one cupful of granulated 
sugar will make one jelly glass of honey. Pare and grate the quinces, 
then stir this grated pulp into a boiling syrup made of the sugar and 
enough water to dissolve it. Stir slowly and quite often until the pulp 
will remain suspended through the syrup. One should not get it too 
stiff. Put into jell}^ glasses, and when cool cover in the same way you 
do preserves and jellies, and keep in the preserve closet. 

Quince Jam. — Take one pint of quince juice left from preserves, add 
one pound of sliced apples, three-q-uarters of a pound of sugar; boil two 
hours, stirring w^ell ; pour into glasses while hot and seal. 

Quince and Pear Sauce. — Three pounds light brown sugar, six pounds 
pears, quartered if large, small ones cut in halves; nine pounds quinces, 
quartered. Boil sugar, pears i'ud quinces nearly all day, taking care not 
to let them cook too rapidly, until both pears and quinces are of a rich 
red, and the juice an amber syrup. Can and seal tight. The fruit keeps 
its shape, the pears having gained a fine flavor from the quinces, and the 
quinces having an added goodness from the pears. 

Raisine Bourgogne. — Stem c-.nd seed tw^o pounds of ripe grapes. Boi! 
with one cup of water until soft. Press through a sieve and add two 
pounds of ripe pears, peeled and sliced; cook until reduced to half the 
amount. Weigh and add an equal amount of sugar, stir until the sugar 
is dissolved, strain again, put in small earthen jars, set in a plate-warm- 
ing oven for a day or until firm to the touch. Tie down and keep in a 
cool place. 

Raspberry and Currant Bar-le-Duc. — To four pounds of raspberries 
add one pound of currants; bruise the currants and strain the juice; add 
to it three-quarters of a pound of sugar to each pound of juice, including 
♦he weight of the berries left whole. Boil 20 minutes and skim, add the 



138 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

raspberries, cook 20 minutes more. When the syrup jellies on a plate, 
take off and place in glasses or small jars while hot. 

Canned Raspberries. — (Mrs. Mapes's recipe). — First make a syrup by 
boiling seven pounds granulated sugar in ^Yi quarts water. Fill cans with 
fresh berries, putting in as many as possible without crushing the berries. 
Apply covers without the rubbers, and set in a kettle or boiler of cold 
water, so the water comes about two-thirds of the height of the cans. 
Bring to a boil and cook seven to 10 minutes after boiling begins. Now 
take the cans out of the water, remove the covers, fill with hot syrup 
brimming full, and seal up tight in the usual way. 

Uncooked Canned Rhubarb. — Wash, peel, cut into inch ' cubes and 
fill compactly into glass jar, then pour slowly into the jar good fresh 
water to overflowing. Adjust rubber, screw on the top and set away in 
a cool place until morning. I'hen if there be any air bubbles, tap the 
side of the jar, fill again to the brim with water and screw on cover 
tightly. If tops and rubbers are perfect the rhubarb will keep until used. 

Canned Rhubarb. — Wash it, cut into inch pieces, put in a preserving 
kettle, and let it come to a good boil all through, without a particle 
of sugar. It will keep perfectly. When you wish to open it for use, 
take one cupful of sugar for a pie, and it will be like the fresh pie plant. 
For a small family, the pint cans are much better for any fruit. 

Rhubarb Jam with Ginger. — String some rhubarb, cut into short 
lengths, and weigh. Put into a kettle and add just enough water to pre- 
vent burning. When it has become quite soft, add sugar, one pound for 
each pound of rhubarb. Stir well until the jam becomes rich and syrup.v. 
For each pound take about a teaspoonful of ground ginger, rub it smooth 
with a little water, and add it to your jam. Boil up jam again, stirring 
well; put into glasses, and when cold cover. If a large amount of rhu- 
barb is at command, a high grade of brown sugar is very good; the only 
difference seems to be that the jam is not quite so clear. 

Rhubarb Jelly. — Make when the rhubarb is tender, using the pink 
variety without peeling it, as much of the flavor and all of the color is 
in the skin. Cook eight pounds of rhubarb with the yellow part of the 
peel from three lemons, in a covered dish, until all the juice of the rhu- 
barb is free. Strain, and add all the juice that ca'n be extracted from 
the three lemons. Boil half an hour and strain through a bag. To 
each cupful of this juice add a cup and a quarter of granulated sugar, 
which should be heated before putting into 'the juice. Stir until the 
sugar is entirely dissolved, then boil without stirring until it jellies when 
tested. A fine jelly which may be made later in the season has three- 
fourths of a pound of tart apple's (peeled and cored) cut and cooked 
with each pound of rhubarb. Cook until soft and drain through bag 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 139 

without pressing. Allow a cup of vinegar to each cup of juice and 
proceed as in former recipe.^ 

Rhubarb and Orange Jam.— To a quart of cut up rhubarb, add half 
a dozen oranges, peeled, cut up and with the pits removed, and a pound 
and a half of sugar. Boil gently until a little set on a plate will jelly. 
This can be varied by slicing the peel of three oranges in thin strips and 
adding it to the fruit. This jam will also keep indefinitely in earthen 
jars, or jelly glasses which have been sealed with paraffin. 

Rhubarb and Pineapple. — The following rule for canning is a decided 
improvement upon pineapple alone, and the rhubarb taste disappears. 
Chop and cook equal parts of pineapple and rhubarb, and add a cupful 
of sugar for each pint jar. 

Rhubarb Marmalade. — Peel the rhubarb, and cut into pieces one-half 
inch long. Put into a large earthen bowl, and cover with sugar in the 
proportion of one pound of sugar to one quart of rhubarb. Allow this to 
stand over night, or 15 to IS hours. Be sure that the bowl is amply 
large, as there will be a flood of juice by morning. Strain off the juice 
and sugar into a preserving kettle; when it begins to boil, add the rhu- 
barb. Boil slowly for an hour, or until the preserve assumes a deep 
red color, stirring carefully to prevent burning, and removing any scum 
that rises to the top. About 15 or 20 minutes before removing from the 
fire, peel the yellow rind from one lemon, chop it fine, and add to the 
preserve, together with the juice of two lemons, this being our usual 
proportion to about four or five quarts of preserve, but the quantity of 
lemon may be varied to suit the taste. This gives a piquant flavor other- 
wise lacking, in spite of the acidity of the rhubarb. When bottled, keep 
in a cool, dark place. This rhubarb jam is very nice in open tarts, or as 
a filling for boiled roly puddings. 

Rhubarb and Almond Marmalade. — Cut rhubarb up very fine, and to 
each cupful add the pulp and juice of one orange, one teaspoonful of the 
grated yellow of the rind, one tablespoonful lemon juice and one and one- 
half cup of sugar. Let stand until the sugar is dissolved, boil rapidly 
until transparent, then add one-half cup of blanched almonds cut in 
ihin slices, boil up once and put in glasses. 

Hackensack Rhubarb Marmalade.— Cut a. pound and a half of rhubarb 
into inch lengths and put it in an earthen dish. Scatter over this a 
quarter of a pound of figs and an ounce of candied peel (both cut fine) ; 
over all sprinkle a pound and a quarter of sugar and let stand over 
night. In the morning boil for about 15 minutes, then add a pound 
of either orange or lemon pulp, cut fine, and cook until heavy enough to 
be firm when cold. Put in jelly glasses, and when cool cover with paraf- 
fin, or any other material used for keeping air from jellies. 

Rhubarb and Fig Marmalade.— Three pounds of rhubarb, three pounds 



140 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

of sugar, one pound of figs, juice of one lemon and grated rind of half. 
Wash the figs and cut fine and put in the bottom of the kettle; cut rhu- 
barb into inch cubes and spread evenly over the figs; over the rhubarb 
distribute one pound of the sugar and let stand over night. In the morn- 
ing cook slowly until it looks clear, then add remainder of sugar and cook 
until thick. About fifteen minutes before taking from the stove add 
juice and rind of lemon. This quantity will make two quarts of mar- 
malade. It can be sealed while hot, or put in jelly glasses and covered 
with parafifin. 

Rhubarb and Orange Marmalade. — Three pounds of rhubarb, four 
and one-half pounds of sugar, three oranges, the grated rind of one 
orange. After grating the yellow from one orange, remove the peel 
from all three and cut in small pieces. Cut the rhubarb in inch cubes, 
mix with one and one-half pounds of sugar and the oranges and let 
stand twenty-four hours. Cock until it looks clear, then heat the re- 
maining three pounds of sugar, add, and cook until thick. 

Rhubarb and Raisin Marmalade. — Four pounds rhubarb, four oranges, 
juice of ail, peel of two; four pounds sugar, one lemon, two pounds of 
raisins. Peel and cut the rhubarb into half-inch pieces., Prepare the 
oranges by squeezing out juice and cooking the peel in water till tender. 
Drain and scrape out white skin. Extract. the juice of the lemon. Put 
the rhubarb into a granite preserving kettle, heat it slowly to boiling, 
cook fifteen minutes, then add the sugar, orange juice and peel, lemon 
juice and raisins, and cook slowly until thick. 

Spiced Rhubarb. — Peel and slice 2^ pounds of rhubarb; sprinkle a 
potmd of sugar over it and let stand until morning. Drain off the syrup 
and add one cup of sugar and half a cupful each of vinegar and water. 
Drop into this syrup small bags filled with a mixture composed of one 
third of a teaspoonful each of cloves, mace, allspice and ginger, and a 
teaspoonful of cinnamon. Boil until the syrup begins to thicken, then 
take out the bags and add the rhubarb and cook until clear. 

Canned Strawberries. — To can strawberries so that they will keep 
their shape and color, after the berries are picked over, put them in .t 
jar, with a layer of sugar and then of berries until all are used. Set 
them in the cellar over night, and the sugar will penetrate them, and no 
water must be added: there will be sufficient juice. Have a sugar syrup 
on the stove hot, put the strawberries in and let them boil up gently; 
llien fill cans with the fruit and juice all cooked together. Screw on 
the cover, stand the can upside down a few minutes, then turn again, 
changing it in this way until it is cool, and the berries will not rise to 
the top. This way preserves the shape, color, and flavor of the fruit. 

Canned Strawberries, No. 2. — An excellent way to can strawberries, 
raspberries or any fruit that requires little or no cooking is the follow- 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 141 

ing : Prepare fruit carefully, discarding all blemished or imperfect berries. 
Prepare a syrup of one quart of water boiled, one cupful of sugar. More 
or less sugar may be added according to the taste of family and the 
acidity of the fruit to be canned. Have jars thoroughly sterilized as 
above, fill with the prepared fruit, pour over the syrup until it is filled to 
the brim. Screw on cap after adjusting rubber. Place jars in a stone 
crock with thin strips of board or a cloth under them and pour around 
them enough boiling water to fill crock up to the rubbers on jars. Cover 
with blankets, carpets, etc., to exclude air, and leave over night or until 
the water is cold. Canned in this way soft fruits keep both shape and 
color, and very nearly resemble fresh fruit. Fruits that lose color, such 
a?, strawberries or red raspberries, should have paper bags or pasteboard 
boxes slipped over them to exclude the light. 

Canned Strawberries, No. 3. — Fill a quart jar with large, ripe berries, 
from which the hulls have been taken; fill the jar with cold water; then 
pour It out again into a measure. For every twelve jars to be put up 
use thirteen of these measures of water and in it dissolve six pounds of 
sugar. Pack the jar with berries as closely as possible without mashing 
them. Fill each jar up to the shoulder with syrup, cover loosely with 
the lid and set it in a large boiler, which should have a loosely fitting 
v/ooden bottom pierced with holes. If set on the metal bottom the jars 
are liable to crack. Wlieii tiie boiler is full of jars pour in cold water 
up to their shoulders ; cover it and set it on the fire. At the same time 
put the surplus syrup in a saucepan and allow it to become hot. As soon 
as the water in the boiler begins to boil note the time, and when it has 
boiled for eight minutes remove the boiler from the fire. Take out one 
jar at a time, fill it even with the hot syrup in the saucepan, fasten it 
airtight and stand it back in the boiler until all are filled and covered; 
lei. them stand there until cold, and then store in a cool place. 

Uncooked Canned Strawberries. — A correspondent of the Chicago 
Record-Herald says that she has preserved strawberries and red raspber- 
lies without cooking for years with entire success. Her method is as fol- 
lows : Mash together with a silver fork equal quantities of fruit and sugar. 
Let stand for. an hour or more until the sugar is entirely dissolved. 
Then put into jelly glasses or pint jars, filling to the brim. Leave un- 
covered for 48 hours in an open window exposed to the sun. Then seal 
in the usual way and keep in a cool, dark place. The flavor of the ber- 
ries is as when picked, and the jam is rich and delicious. All utensils 
used must be absolutely clean and jars sterilized. 

Dried Strawberries. — One quart of strawberries, clean off the stem and 
hull. Wash; add one pound of granulated sugar, put in a porcelain 
or granite kettle, set on stove, and heat gently till they come to a boiling 
point, then boil hard for 20 minutes. Do not stir, just shake the kettle 



14« THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

enongh to keep from burning, then pour out on large plates, and dry 
in the sun for at least three days, or until the juice has become jellied; 
't may take a longer time or a little less according to heat of sun. Do 
not let them stay out of doors over night, as the dew will cause the 
juice to get thin again. When the juice has become jellied, pack in jars 
and make airtight. These are most delicious and very delicate in flavor; 
the berries are whole and clear. 

Strawberry and Currant Jam. — To every pound of fruit allow three- 
quarters of a pound of sugar, also one pint of red currant juice to every 
four pounds of the berries. Boil the currant juice with the strawberries 
for half an hour, stirring all the time, then add the sugar and boil 20 
minutes longer, skimming carefully. Put in small jars or tumblers with 
paraffin on top. The currant juice may be omitted. 

Wiesbaden Strawberries. — Take six pounds of strawberries — they need 
not be large or extra fine, but they must be sound; add to them in the 
kettle a very little cold water and cook slowly as for jelly. Pour in a 
jelly bag and allow them to drip overnight. In the morning add to the 
juice six pounds of broken loaf or granulated sugar and half a pound 
of strained honey. Boil to a very thick syrup Fill pint cans with freshly 
capped strawberries, the largest and finest to be had. Screw on the tops, 
set in cold water in a large kettle — the wash boiler will do — and let the 
water come to a boil. Open the jars and fill to the brim with the 
hot syrup. Seal and put away in a cool, dark place. 

Tomato Butter. — Cook ripe tomatoes, salt to taste and put them 
through a colander to remove the seeds. Plave ready an equal quantity 
of sour apple sauce, well cooked; add it to the tomatoes, sweeten slightly 
and let it boil until the mixture begins to thicken. Be careful that it does 
not burn. Seal in jelly glasses. Excellent to serve with meats. 

Tomato Butter No. 2. — Seven pounds of large, ripe tomatoes, four 
pounds of brown sugar, half a cupful of vinegar, one teaspoonful of 
cmnamon, one teaspoonful of cloves. Pour boiling water over the toma- 
toes; let stand five minutes, then the skins can be rubbed off. Remove 
stem end, then slice tomatoes. Cook until soft, add the sugar and stew 
until very thick; then add spices and vinegar. Let simmer 20 minutes, 
pour into jars and seal. 

Tomato and Apple Butter. — Scald and skin ripe tomatoes, add a 
quarter of the quantity of pared, cored and quartered pleasant sour 
apples. Weigh the kettle, put in the tomatoes and apples and cook to the 
consistency of marmalade, then to every six pounds add a teaspoonful of 
ginger, the juice of a large lemon and four pounds of light brown sugar; 
boil fifteen minutes, or until it will spread smoothly. 

Green Tomato Butter. — Select tomatoes that are full grown, but quite 
green. Slice them thin. Make a syrup in proportion of one pound of 






THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 143 

sugar to two pounds of tomatoes. Boil down slowly for four hours or 
until the butter is smooth and thick, stirring frequently to prevent stick- 
ing. Flavor with lemon when done. 

Green Tomato Conserve. — For one peck of green tomatoes, slice six 
lemons without removing the skin, but taking out the seeds. Put to this 
quantity six pounds of sugar and boil until transparent and the syrup 
thick. Ginger root may be added if liked. 

Tomato Jam. — Select sound, ripe fruit and peel and quarter them. 
Then put them into the preserving kettle with an equal weight of loaf 
sugar, the strained juice and rind of a lemon for every four pounds of 
the fruit, and a little powdered ginger. Cook the mixture slowly until 
it jellies when tried en a spoon. Turn into jars and cover. 

Tomato Marmalade. — Remove the skin from four quarts of ripe 
tomatoes and slice. Cut six large lemons in halves, lengthwise, and slice 
very thin. Seed one cup of raisins. Put the tomatoes, raisins and 
lemons into a preserving kettle, in layers, alternating with four pounds 
of granulated sugar. Cook one hour on the front of stove. Then set 
the kettle back, and allow contents to simmer until it is of the consistency 
of marmalade. Put up, while hot, as jelly. This recipe makes about 
two and one-half quarts. When properly prepared no one article will be 
recognizable. The small yellow tomatoes are nice for such use. 

Tomato Marmalade No. 2.— -For every two pounds of the tomatoes 
allow two pounds of sugar and the juice and grated rind of one lemon. 
Pour scalding water over the tomatoes to loosen the skins. After remov- 
ing the skin, mix the tomatoes with the sugar and boil slowly for one 
hour, stirring and skimming frequently. At the end of that time add 
the lemon juice and rind and cook another hour or until the whole is 
a thick, smooth mass. 

Tomato Mock-Orange Marmalade. — Scald and peel large-sized yellow 
tomatoes. Cut downward over each seed section, press open and remove 
all seeds with the thumb, leaving the pulp comparatively whole. To two 
parts of the prepared tomatoes allow one part of oranges, slicing thinly. 
Cover all with an equal quantity of sugar and let stand over night. In 
the morning pour off syrup and cook down about half, add the tomatoes 
and oranges and cook until the orange skins are transparent. Seal in 
jelly glasses. This is an original recipe, and is a delightful substitute 
for the genuine orange marmalade, though much cheaper. 

Tomato Mincemeat. — Chop fine four quarts of green tomatoes, drain 
off juice, cover with cold water and bring to a boil, scalding for 30 
minutes, then drain. Repeat till parboiled three times. Add two pounds 
brown sugar, one pound seeded raisins, one-half pound chopped citron, 
one large half cup chopped suet, one tablespoonful salt and one-half cup 



144 TM1£ RVkAL COOK BOOK. 

strong vinegar. Mix and cook until thick. When cold add one tea- 
spoonful each of ground cinnamon and cloves, and one tablespoonful of 
grated nutmeg (or suit taste). ]\Iix thoroughly, and keep in open jar. 

Tomato Clove Preserves. — To four pounds of yellov^r plum tomatoes, 
not too ripe, allow four pounds of sugar, three lemons and one-half 
ounce (or according to taste) of whole cloves. Peel the tomatoes with- 
out breaking, sprinkle sugar over and let them stand over night. In the 
morning pour off the syrup, add the cloves and let it boil until thick, then 
strain. Return to fire and add the chopped pulp of the lemons, rejecting 
the skin, and the tomatoes, and cook gently until the tomatoes look clear. 
Put into jars and seal. To give a quite different flavor substitute one- 
half ounce of ginger root for the cloves, and proceed as above. 

Green Tomato Preserves. — Required, eight pounds of small green 
tomatoes, seven pounds of sugar, one ounce of ginger and mace mixed, 
and the juice of four lemons. Pierce each of the tomatoes with a fork 
and put them in the preserving kettle with all the other ingredients. Heat 
slowly, then boil until the tomatoes are clear, then skim them out and boil 
the syrup until thick. Put tlie tomatoes into jars and pour in the 
hot syrup. 

Yellow Tomato Preserves. — Put the tomatoes into a wire basket and 
plunge into boiling water to loosen the skins. When a cut is made across 
the skin its whole contents can be quickly squeezed out. Three-fourths 
of a pound of sugar is allowed for each pound of the fruit pulp, and 
sometimes ginger root is added for flavoring. Prolonged cooking is not 
necessary; just before ready for the jars add several lemons sliced in 
thin even circles. 

Ruby Watermelon Preserves. — Dice the red portion of the melon, 
removing all seeds and every bit of the white part; weigh and use halt 
as much sugar as you have melon, adding to every six pounds of melon 
the juice and grated yellow rinds of two lemons. Put all together in a 
large granite kettle and boil slowly, stirring often until it is quite thick; 
at first you will think it is all going to water, but very soon you will 
notice it thicken nicely; when it has become as thick as you like it, seal 
hot in glass pint jars. 



JELLIES. 

Jelly should never be stored in a cellar. It demands a cool, dry, dark 
place, which can be well ventilated, to insure its keeping perfectly. Great 
care must be given the juice, sugar, etc. The glasses should be hot, dry 
and clean (surgically clean, we mean). Small tapering cups or bowls 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 145 

make jelly a nicer shape to turn out to serve, but the regulation jelly glass 
with its tin top comes much cheaper. 

A safe rule with all fruits that do not get firm is to add sufficient sour 
apple juice to make the jelly the right consistency. By choosing a bright 
day, boiling the juice 20 minutes before adding the sugar and going strictly 
according to directions even an amateur can have success. The best 
jellies are not boiled as hard as wanted but sunned under glass for 
several days. 

For filling the glasses, use a china cup with a handle. A saucer or 
small plate held in the left hand and moved with and iinder the cup will 
catch all drops. In case you do not fill a tumbler full from the first dip 
add the requisite quantity immediately afterward, so that all will stiffen 
together, otherwise there may be separation in the contents of the tumbler 
when it is turned out. As a general rule for jelly, wash and drain the 
fruit, then put it on the stove in a large stone crock, or in a granite 
vessel. The fruit should be mature, but not overripe. Add no water 
to small and juicy fruits. Large fruits, such as apples, peaches and pears, 
require some water ; our rule is to put the fruit in the crock, and pour in 
enough water to show at the top. Cook slowly, but thoroughly, stirring 
the fruit, which will thus be sufficiently mashed. Strain through a flannel 
bag, which should be scalded first, or through a stout cotton or linen; the 
fiannel insures clearness, but we have no trouble with this when properly 
boiled, nor do we add white of egg, as some cooks recommend. Most 
people advise letting the fruit drain over night, and boiling the next day, 
but we think it jellies better if the fruit is cooked, drained, and the juice 
boiled the same day. The bag is of course hung over a large china bowl, 
and pressed down a little with a wooden spoon ; its own weight, however, 
soon drains it dry. The juice is measured, and put on to boil ; granulated 
sugar is measured, cup for cup, and put in a bowl on the back of the 
stove, wliere it is heated, being stirred from time to time, so that by the 
time the juice boils it is well heated through. Any scum that arises is 
skimmed off, and as soon as the juice comes to a boil the warmed sugar 
is stirred in. Continue to skim it as needed, and notice when it comes 
to a boil. Currant jelly made in this way will only need three minutes' 
boiling; other small fruits a little longer; they should be tested in a little 
cup. If boiled too long jelly becomes ropy. If boiled too hard, so that 
sugar crystallizes on the sides of the kettle, which is stirred in afterwards, 
the jelly may candy. In making jelly from fruit to which water has been 
added, as crab apple, it is measured, and three-quarters the amount of 
sugar put to heat. When put i:i the kettle, the depth of juice is measured 
with a stick, on which are two notches, one for the original depth, and 
one for two-thirds the amount. As soon as the juice has boiled down 
one-third add the warmed sugar, and boil. 



14« THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Apple Jelly.—We like Fall Pippins fof this purpose, but Gravenstein 
or any other highly-flavored apple, nearly ripe, makes a fine jelly. The 
jelly is excellent without any additional flavoring, but we prefer to add 
Rose geranium leaves, which render it delicious ; four leaves to a quart 
of jelly. The leaves are put in with the sugar, and taken out when the 
jelly is put in glasses. Another variation is made by using three whole 
cloves to a quart of jelly; this imitates the nutmeg jelly made in Trinidad, 
the spiciness being so faint that it does not overpower the fruit flavor. 
To prepare apples for jelly, wipe them with a damp cloth, remove the 
stem and blossom ends and cut in quarters. Put in granite or porcelain- 
lined preserve kettle, and for three pounds of apples add one pint of 
water. Cover and cook slowly until apples are soft; mash, then drain 
through a coarse sieve. Do not squeeze, or jelly will be cloudy. Next 
allow juice to drip through a double thickness of cheesecloth or flannel 
jelly bag. Or they may be turned directly into jelly bag and allowed to 
drip over night. Measure juice, boil 20 minutes, and add an equal quan- 
tity of heated granulated sugar, boil five minutes, skim and turn into 
glasses that have been dipped into scalding water and placed on a wet 
cloth. Put a silver spoon in the tumbler before turning the jelly in as 
another means of avoiding cracking the glass; it can be moved from 
tumbler to tumbler as you proceed. Fill brimming full, as the jelly will 
shrink as it cools. The glasses may now be placed in a sunny window, 
protected from dust, and let stand for 24 hours. Cover with melted 
paraffin, poured directly on to the jelly; then seal as usual. 

Apple Combination. — A housewife who has tried it says that a deli- 
cious combination jelly is made by cooking a half peck each of apples 
and quinces and a quart of cranberries together until soft, after barely 
covering with water. Strain, and to every pint of juice allow a scant pint 
of sugar, then proceed as with other jellies. It is delicately flavored, and 
a beautiful pink in color. 

Barberry Jell3^ — For domestic use the berries should not be gathered 
until well frosted. For jelly the fruit need not be stripped from the stems. 
Put the fruit in a porcelain kettle with water to come to the top of the 
berries and boil until thoroughly cooked, then put into a jelly bag and 
drain out the juice; return the juice to the kettle and boil hard 15 minutes. 
Measure it before boiling down. Add a pound of sugar to each pint and 
boil rapidly 10 minutes, then put away in glasses. This is an excellent 
jelly to serve with meat. 

Blackberry Jelly. — Make the same as currant -jelly. 

Crab-apple Jelly. — Wash, cut in pieces two gallons of crab apples; 
place in the preserving kettle, just cover with cold water and cook until 
the pieces are tender. Drain through cheesecloth, measure, and when 
the juice has boiled 10 minutes, stir in one pound white sugar to each 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. UT 

pint of juice. Boil hard until it is jelly; about 10 minutes' boiling after 
the sugar has been added. Now take the tender pieces left after straining, 
rub through a sieve or colander ; to each pint of pulp add one-half as 
much sugar. Cook until the sugar is thoroughly blended with the pulp, 
stirring quite frequently. Add spices if preferred, fill into glass cans, seal, 
and take to the cellar when cool. This makes a delicious butter, almost 
a marmalade, and is very nice in the Winter with pork. Two gallons of 
crab apples will make six glasses of jelly and five or six quarts of butter 
with the addition of 11 pounds of sugar. Crab apple will mix well with 
wild grapes for jell3^ The two fruits should be cooked together, and 
made like any other jelly. The proportion may be whatever is most 
convenient; half and half, or one-third grapes to two-thirds apples, will 
be found excellent. 

Wild Crab-apple Jelly. — Cook the cored crabs till tender and drip in a 
jelly bag. Use more sugar than for ordinary jelly — about five cups of 
sugar to four of juice — and cook quickly. This is delicious both in 
color and flavor. 

Mrs. C.'s Currant Jelly. — The currants are picked over as if for 
canning, then put in the preserving kettle. As the fruit heats, it is mashed 
with a large spoon until juice is pretty nearly all extracted. The juice 
is all dipped off and her jelly is made according to the common recipe. 
She now adds to the currants left in kettle an equal amount of raspber- 
ries — either black or red is added, and jam is made by the addition of 
diree-fourths of a pound of granulated sugar to each pound of fruit. 
In this way she says jelly making is an easy task, and she also has the 
consciousness of having used every bit of the currants. 

Elderberry Jelly. — Strip the ripe berries into the kettle and stir over 
the fire with a wooden spoon until the juice flows freely; turn into a 
jelly bag and let drain without touching so as not to become cloudy. 
Weigh and boil sharply 15 minutes. Remove from fire and add sugar, 
allowing 14 ounces to one pint of juice. Boil 15 minutes, stirring and 
skimming until it jellies. This is an English recipe and a very good one. 

Elderberry Jelly No. 2. — Take equal parts of elderberries and wild 
grapes, and cook to extract juice, strain, add sugar in proportion of one 
pound to each pint of liquid, and cook as other jelly. This is especially 
nice for invalids, and beneficial in cases of sore throat. 

Grape Jelly. — The wild grapes gathered just as they begin to turn are 
the best for jelly. Free them from their stems and wash them, mash 
them, and heat slowly; cook them until the juice is well drawn out; turn 
into a flannel bag and let it drip without pressure; measure the juice, and, 
if cultivated grapes are used, allow an equal amount of sugar; if the wild 
grape, allow a little more than an equal measure. Heat the sugar (put in 
a pan in the oven and stir often) ; boil the strained juice 15 minutes; skim 



148 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

and strain again, add the sugar, boil until the surface looks wrinkled, skim 
well and turn into glasses. 

Green Grape Jelly. — Select the grapes when full grown, just before 
they begin to turn purple. After separating from the stem, wash, adding 
a little water if the grapes are not very juicy. IMash and stew until the 
skins are cooked. Strain first through the colander, then through the jelly 
bag. Measure the juice, measure the same amount of sugar, putting it in 
the oven while the juice is being boiled. The boiling will take half an 
hour. Now add the hot sugar, which you must be careful not to scorch, 
boil about five minutes longer, and then the jelly should be ready to pour 
in glasses. Jelly made from the green grapes is solid, of a delicious flavor 
and of a pretty green tint. 

Spiced Grape Jelly. — This is delicious served with cold meats. Take 
equal amounts of grape juice and sugar. Add one-half teaspoonful of 
ground cloves and one tablespoonful of cinnamon to each quart of juice. 
Add the sugar as directed in recipe above. 

IMarble Jelly. — A dark jelly, such as blackberry or grape, is poured into 
a half-gallon crock; as soon as this hardens a light jelly, apple, quin.:e or 
pear, is poured on top ; so on in alternate layers until the crock is filled. 
The layers look prettiest when but an inch thick. Slice in half-inch slices, 
serve on a pretty glass dish. Besides being unique in appearance the 
blending of flavors is decidedly appetizing. 

Peach Jelly. — Take sound, high-flavored, barely ripe peaches. Wash 
them thoroughly. Use the parings and a few pieces of fruit. Boil in 
enough water to cover in an enameled kettle until the skins are tender 
and broken. Strain through a jelly bag. Allow the juice of one lemon 
and one scant pound of sugar to each pint of juice. Boil the juice twenty 
minutes after straining, and m.eantime heat the sugar in the oven. Put 
the sugar into the juice slowly, let boil five minutes and pour into tumblers. 

Peach Jelly No, 2. — Take the peach parings from a peck or two of 
peaches and simmer with sour apples till the whole mass is tender. Have 
twice the quantity of peach that you have of apple and make your jelly 
in the ordinary way. 

Pear Jelly. — Select juicy pears that are not top ripe, quarter, core and 
cut in small pieces without paring. Put in a kettle' with one pint of 
water to every four pounds of pears. Cook over a slow fire to a pulp, 
turn into a jelly bag which has been wrung out, and let drip without 
squeezing. Measure the juice and allow the same quantity of sugar. Put 
the liquid over the fire, bring to the boiling point and boil 20 minutes. In 
the meantime heat the sugar by spreading it out on pans and setting it in 
an open oven; when the pear juice has boiled twenty minutes add the 
heated sugar, stir until it is dissolved, bring again to the boiling point, 
and boil until in dropping a spoonful on a cold saucer a skin forms 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 1-19 

quickly over it; this will generally occur after five or ten minutes' boiling. 
Take from the fire and pour into jelly glasses. Let stand until cold, pour 
over the top of each glass a little melted paraffin, and when it hardens 
cover. 

Plum Jelly. — Pour boiling water over one-half peck of plums placed 
in a colander. Then put them in a preserving kettle, pour over them just 
enough water to cover and boil until the plums have become soft and 
the juice has flowed out. Drain through a colander, then through a jelly 
bag without squeezing. Measure juice and put to boil in preserve kettle. 
Add one dozen blanched plum kernels. Allow an equal measure of 
granulated sugar and put it to heat in shallow pans in the oven. When 
the juice has boiled 20 minutes skim well, add the hot sug.ir, stir until 
dissolved, let come to the boiling point, take immediately from the fire 
and fill into glasses which have been rolled in boiling water, drained and 
stood upright on a cloth folded in a shallow pan of boiling water. Use 
a small teacup to dip the jelly into the tumblers, and fill them very full. 
Cover airtight next day. The pulp remaining may be used to make a 
little marmalade, allowing three-quarters of a pint of sugar to one pint 
of pulp, and a few blanched kernels from the plum stones. 

Plum and Green Grape Jelly. — Plums mixed with green grapes make 
the most delicious of all tart jellies. Small yellow plums are the best. 
Wash, pick and scald them with their own bulk of green grapes picked 
from the stem, strain out the juice, let it settle 10 minutes, then pour it 
carefully off the sediment. Put in a shallow kettle over a quick fire, boil 
for five minutes, skimming well; then add for each pint of juice a pound 
and a quarter of very hot granulated sugar ; stir hard until the sugar 
dissolves; then skim again and boil hard for two minutes. Drop a little 
in ice water — the minute this hardens take it off the fire and pour into 
hot glasses. 

Plum and Peach.— Japan plums not quite ripe, with a few peaches, 
make a nice clear amber jelly. 

Quince Jelly. — Simmer the quinces in a stone jar till tender in enough 
water to cover them. Drip and strain the juice and boil 20 minutes before 
adding an almost equal amount of sugar. This will be a beautiful color 
if well made and have a delicate flavor. 

Quince Jelly No. 2. — Place the parings and cores left from preserving 
in the preserving kettle, cover with cold water and cook until the parings 
are soft ; strain through cheesecloth, measure, and when boiling hard, put 
a pound of white sugar to each pint of the juice. Boil hard until it will 
set. Ten minutes of hard boiling is usually enough; then pour into 
glasses. 

Quince and Cranberry. — Stew cores and skins of quinces in very little 
water, and strain the juice as for quince jelly; stew tart cranberries 



150 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

separately in very little water, strain, and combine with an equal propor- 
tion of quince juice. Add to the combined juices one cupful of sugar to 
each cupful of juice, and boil briskly until it jellies. 

Raspberry Jelly. — One of our friends tells us with pride that she made 
delicious stiff raspberry jelly last year by mixing the red raspberries with 
an equal quantity of green grapes. The two fruits were cooked together, 
then strained as usual. The resulting jelly was clear red, with full rasp- 
berry flavor. Our friend had never been able to make raspberries "jell" 
properly before, so she was much pleased with the experiment. It is 
quite possible that green grapes would stiffen strawberry jelly, which is 
usually difficult to harden. Some experimenters say they mix either red 
currants or early apples with strawberries to make jelly. If raspberries 
and Summer apples are available at the same time, a combination of the 
two will make an excellent jelly. Cook and strain separately, then mix 
the juice, and proceed as with any other jelly. Raspberry and red cur- 
rants mixed are excellent. 

Rhubarb Jelly. — On account of the watery'- consistency of the fruit it 
cannot be made into jelly as readily as most fruit. A fine jelly and one 
specially suitable for serving with game can be made if the following 
directions are observed: Let the rhubarb heat on the back of the stove 
until the juice flows freely. Strain the juice through a jelly bag. Do not 
squeeze the bag into .the jelly, but use only what will drip of itself. The 
bag can be squeezed into a different vessel, and the liquid thus gained can 
be re-added to the pulp of the rhubarb and made into jam. Take the 
rhubarb juice and boil gently for 10 minutes. Measure and to each pint 
allow a pound of granulated sugar. Boil until a little poured out on a 
cold plate will set nicely. Do not measure the juice before it has been 
boiled. Such treatment is needed to reduce the water and make the pure 
juice and sugar jelly properly. If care is taken in the boiling of the 
jelly, it turns out a pretty color and is very desirable for garnishing 
various dishes. 

Rhubarb Jelly No. 2. — ^Cut off the leaves and ends from the stalks, 
and wipe with a clean, damp cloth. Use an earthen dish for cooking. 
Without removing the skins, cut the rhubarb into pieces 2^ inches long, 
and put over them IJ^ cupful of sugar, a piece of leifion peel, and a pint 
of water, this proportion to two pounds of rhubarb. Cover and set in 
the oven on a shelf. Moisten a half ounce of white gelatine in a quarter 
of a cupful of cold water. When the rhubarb rs tender put the gelatine 
in a large bowl, on which an earthen colander is placed. Pour the 
rhubarb on this, but remove it very soon to a dish, in order to retain 
sufficient juice with it. Stir the hot liquid underneath, and when the 
gelatine is dissolved pour into teacups or molds dipped in cold water. 

Strawberry Jelly. — To 10 quarts of strawberries add two quarts of 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 161 

currants, and proceed as for currant jelly, but boil 15 minutes. Or 
use apple juice instead of currants. 

Tomato Jelly. — Simmer yellow tomatoes without water till pulpy and 
then drip in a bag. Take equal parts of tomato and apple juice and 
proceed in the ordinary way. 

Watermelon Jelly. — Alash the heart of a dead-ripe melon and strain 
the juice so obtained. Boil to a thick syrup with equal parts of granu- 
lated sugar and add to apple juice; then proceed as for apple jelly. 

We always pour melted paraffin over the top of our jelly before 
putting the cover on. Break the paraffin in pieces, put in a cup, and set 
the cup in a pan of warm water on the back of the stove; it will soon 
melt enough to pour. It should be one-fourth inch thick over the jelly; 
if too thin it cracks. If you heive reason to fear mold, cut disks of white 
paper to fit the top of the glass; dip in brandy or grain alcohol, and pour 
the paraffin over this. If the room or closet in which jelly is stored is 
damp, Prof. Conn recommends setting a few lumps of unslaked lime about 
on the shcives, removing when they crumble. 



CANDIED FRUITS. 

Cherries. — Get large, sound cherries and cut off the stem to avoid tear- 
ing the fruit. Wipe with a soft cloth. Weigh the cherries and then 
weigh out an equal amount of fine sugar. Sprinkle a little sugar over the 
cherries and let them stand over night. With the rest of the sugar make a 
thick syrup and let that stand over night. In the morning bring the syrup 
to boiling heat; put the cherries in and boil for five minutes. Let them 
stand together for 24 hours, drain off the syrup and boil long enough to 
get rid of the juice from the cherries (until a thick syrup as it was at 
first) and pour over the cherries. The next morning drain oft' the syrup 
and boil to candy degree. Dip each cherry in this and put on a sieve, in 
a warm place to dry. When perfectly dry pack in glass, or in boxes with, 
waxed paper between layers. 

Oranges. — Peel the oranges and separate the sections without breaking 
the white skin that covers them. Place on plates and keep where it is 
warm until dry. Make a syrup with granulated sugar ; boil until it will 
thread and then add two tablespoonfuls of vinegar for each pound of 
sugar used. Boil until it begins to turn straw-colored. The instant this 
change of color shows lift the pan and set it in a pan of boiling water. 
Now take the sections of orange on a greased fork; dip them carefully 
in the syrup, and drop on waxed paper to dry. Lay the orange on the 
fork, never stick the fork through the skin. If the syrup begins to harden 
it may be heated again. Don't stir the syrup at any stage of the work, 



152 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

and when dipping the orange do it gently, or the syrup will be spoiled, and 
for this reason it is not advisable to use more than a pound of sugar at 
one time. 

Peaches. — Pare and halve enough large peaches to weigh two pounds. 
Make a syrup with one-haif a pound of sugar and a cup of water by 
boiling together for five minutes. Drop the fruit in and cook gently until 
tender, then drain out and spread on plates. Boil the syrup until fairly 
thick and pour over the fruit. Place the plates in a warm oven ; turn the 
fruit over frequently until dry. Roll each piece in granulated sugar and 
put in hot sunshine. Let stand in sun an hour or two. When cooled 
pack in layers between waxed paper. 

Pineapple. — Get the finest fruit to be had ; pare and cut into the thin- 
nest possible slices. Weigh, and allow a pound of sugar to each pound of 
fruit. Spread sliced fruit on platters and sprinkle the sugar over it. Keep 
in a warm place for a week — or until dry — then put in a hot oven for 10 
minutes. When cold, pack between waxed papers. 

Quinces. — Boil fruit until tender in as little water as possible (may 
be steamed) and put through a sieve. Weigh the sifted fruit and to each 
pound of fruit allow a pound of sugar. Put fruit and sugar together 
and boil until very thick. Spread on plates ; dry in oven or sun ; cut in 
bars; roll in sugar; dry again, and pack like the others described, or wrap 
each bar in waxed paper. Tin boxes are fine for packing away these 
fruits, but small tin pails will serve the purpose equally well. Glass cans 
are good so far as keeping quality goes, but are not so easy to use. 

CANNING VEGETABLES. 

Vegetables for canning should be fresh gathered, and of the highest 
quality, just in the right condition for eating. 

Asparagus. — Straight-sided quart glass jars, such as the "Royal," should 
be used for asparagus, so as to avoid breaking the stalks. Wash care- 
fully, cut the right length to stand the whole stalk upright in the jar 
and pack in snugly, heads up; then pour in cold water slowly, until the 
jar is full to overflowing, and lay on the tops. Place straw or boards in 
the bottom of the wash-boiler, stand the jars on this, and pour in enough 
cold water to come half way up the jars; put the boilerover the fire, and 
when the v/ater comes to a boil, boil steadily, for three hours. Take up 
the jars, see that they are full to overflowing (if not fill up with boiling 
water) put on rubbers and screw or otherwise fasten the covers tight. 
Keep in a cool, dark place. Another recipe recommends boiling the 
asparagus for 15 minutes, then putting in the jar, and boiling in the 
wash-boiler for 1^ hour, but we think some of the stalks are very 
likely to be broken by this method. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 153 

..Beans. — String beans are cut in lengths, boiled for 10 minutes, then 
put into cans, which are stood in a kettle of water and boiled for two 
hours. Add a teaspoonful of salt, fill the jar to overflowing with boiling 
water, screw up, and keep in a cool dark place. Another plan is as 
follows : Wash and break each pod in two or three pieces, put on the 
stove in a saucepan of cold salt water and when it just commences to 
bubble (don't let it boil) drain the beans out and put in cans that have 
been washed and scalded. Have ready another saucepan of boiling salt 
water and fill the cans nearly to the brim, leaving just room enough for 
one tablespoonful of hot vinegar, screw on the caps and set away. When 
wanted for use pour off the brine and put in a saucepan of fresh water 
with a pinch of soda added ; let them come to a boil and immediately 
pour off the water, then cook as you would fresh beans. 

Dried String Beans. — When fit for the table pick and prepare them 
by removing the strings and breaking up into inch pieces ; put into a 
kettle of cold water and then bring to a scalding heat. Skim out, spread 
on plates and dry in the oven or out of doors until all moisture is 
removed. Put away in bags until snow flies, then take out a quart and 
soak in cold water over night. Next morning boil with a good-sized 
piece of sweet salt pork until tender. 

Beets. — Young beets are delicious canned ; cook until tender in salted 
water the same as for table use. Cut in thin slices, fill the cans and cover 
v>'ith hot vinegar, sweetened and spiced, seal. 

Cauliflower. — Cauliflower may be canned either in vinegar or water. 
Break into flowerets and cook until tender in a small quantity of water, 
pack the cans as full as possible, add the salt, and fill to overflowing with 
hot liquor in which it was cooked, seal. When vinegar is used, steam the 
cauliflower until tender, fill into cans and pour over hot vinegar, sweet- 
ened and soiced. 

Corn. — For canned corn cut the kernels off the cob with a sharp 
knife, scraping out the pulp. Fill into the can a little at a time, pressing 
it down firmly until the milk overflows the can. Add a teaspoonful of 
salt. When all are filled place the cans in a boiler and cook half an 
hour' with the covers laid loosely on. Remove from the fire and seal, 
then cook two hours longer. The preliminary cooking permits the corn 
to swell without endangering the cans, which may burst if tightly sealed 
from the first. Succotash is canned by first half filling the cans with 
green Lima beans, then filling the remainder of the can with corn, 
pressed down firmly. Add a teaspoonful of salt to each can, and cook 
like corn. 

Salted Corn. — This recipe has been highly endorsed by readers who 
have tried it. Have corn "just right" for eating. While it may be 
brought from the field the previous evening it should not be prepared 



154 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

otherwise until the following mornings, as there is danger of its souring. 
Clean and scald your boiler thoroughly and fill with the corn properly 
husked and silked, discarding all ears either over or under ripe. Cook 
as for the table. Removing from the boiler, score each row of kernels 
with a sharp knife and shave off not too close to the cob. After cutting 
from cob, measure and to each eight pints of corn add one pint of salt 
and mix thoroughly with the hands until a brine is formed. Have ready 
a well-scalded and clean crock and pack corn in this as it is mixed. 
When jar is filled within one inch of top, cover with a clean white cloth 
large enough to hang over edge of crock. On this cloth put about an 
inch of salt, and on the salt a plate that fits the top of jar. Now it is 
ready to put in the cellar or any cool place for Fall and Winter use, but 
in its preparation for the table lies the secret of its success. There is 
only one way of making it palatable, but with directions strictly adhered 
to it is preferred by many to canned corn. About one and one-half hour 
before the meal at which one wishes to serve it it must be brought from 
the cellar — enough for one meal — and cold water enough to cover poured 
on and at once poured off. Then sufficient boiling water is poured on to 
cover and it is allowed to stand on the back of the range for 15 minutes. 
This water is drained off and sufficient fresh boiling water poured on to 
cover and the same time allowed. This process is repeated twice more, 
in all four times. , Then cream, butter, sugar and if liked a little pepper 
is added. In short after pouring off the water for the fourth time it is 
prepared exactly as canned corn. The process of removing the salt by a 
swift boiling water process instead of a slow cold water process seems 
to leave the corn as fresh as when taken from the cob. This, together 
with the ease with which it is prepared — so much easier and surer than 
canning — makes the process ideal. 

Southern Dried Corn. — Sew firmly into a quilting-frame a strong 
sheet. Gather the corn when ready for use, husk and remove silk. Put 
on in boiler, cover with water and when it starts boiling let cook well 
for 10 or 15 minutes. Take off, allow it to cool some, then score and cut 
off, but not too close, to have it shucky, and scrape off what remains on 
ear. Have your frame out in a sunny place, spread corn evenly upon it, 
cover with a mosquito netting and it will dry quickly in this way, as it 
dries from below just as fast as above. Then at some convenient time 
when the oven is piping hot put it in the oven to heat well through in 
order to kill any chance "microbe." When it comes time to cook the 
dried corn wash well in water. Put to soak in milk over night and cook 
in the milk it soaked in; season with sugar, salt, pepper and butter, and 
you will find it very good and know that it is clean. 

Uncooked Canned Corn. — Prepare corn by removing husks and silk; 
break into pieces large enough to fit into two-quart cans. Season cold 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 155 

water with just enough salt to taste. Then fill the cans up with this 
salt water; have new rubbers for cans, and when you have got the air 
bubbles all out seal your cans and stand them upside down to see that 
they do not leak. If they do not your corn will keep all right. Some 
cut it off and can same way, but always fill the can first and then put 
in the salt water. We are told that this corn keeps perfectly. 

Peas. — To can peas, fill the jars full of peas, uncooked; then fill 
with cold water, and lay on the tops. Place straw or boards in the 
bottom of the wash boiler, stand the jars on this, and pour enough cold 
water in the boiler to come half way up the jars. Put the boiler on the 
stove with the lid tightly closed, and boil three hours. When the jars 
are taken out, see that they are fuU to overflowing, and screw the lid 
on tight. Another method of preparing peas is to cook five minutes 
in very little water, then fill the cans, and place them in the boiler to 
cook for one hour. A teaspoonful of salt is added the last thing before 
sealing. 

Dried Peas. — Green peas are dried as follows : Shell the peas, put 
them in boiling water, and boil for five minutes. Drain, then spread out 
in shallow trays, and dry in the sun, or near the stove. When dry, store 
away in paper bags, in a dry place. The peas should be soaked before 
using; then boiled in salted water. 

Tomatoes. — Scald to remove the skins, put in the jars whole or halved, 
fill up with cold water; stand the jars in the wash boiler, boil 30 minutes, 
and seal. Do not use any overripe or fermenting fruit. The main things 
to observe in canning vegetables are that the jars are filled to overflow- 
ing; that they are hermetically sealed, while hot, and that they are stored 
in a cool, dry place. Vegetables, like fruits, should be taken in their 
regular order and canned while in the best possible condition. 

Tomatoes Canned Whole. — Select firm, smooth fruit, not overripe, 
and of a size to slip into the ordinary fruit jar. Peel without breaking 
and with as little scalding as possible. Have ready a preserving kettle 
full of water, which has been salted slightly, only enough to taste. Just 
before the water reaches the boiling point drop the tomatoes into it, one 
layer at a time and heat through. Do not allow the water to boil at 
any time. When thoroughly heated transfer tomatoes to the cans, being 
careful not to bruise them. Fill the cans with the hot, salted water, and 
screw the tops on quickly. Turn the cans over in a deep kettle of hot 
water until the rubbers are heated and set, which hermetically seals the 
cans. In using drain from the salt water, and serve exactly as fresh 
tomatoes. 



CHAPTER XIT. 

PirKI.ES AXD RELISHES. 

Amber Pickles. — Choose small yellow pear tomatoes when just turn- 
ing to ripen. Prick each tomato with a needle three times to prevent 
bursting in cooking, and soak half an hour in sa'ted water. Take out 
and put in jars, after which make a syrup of one pint of vinegar, three- 
quarters of a pound of C sugar and a pinch of salt, and put to boil in 
a porcelain kettle. Take one-half dozen cloves, same of whole allspice, 
one peppercorn, a piece of cinnamon, a splinter of mace and a chip of 
ginger root ; tie all in a cheesecloth bag and boil ten minutes in the 
syrup. Remove spice bag and put the tomatoes in the kettle until they 
are heated through (do not let boil), take out with skimmer and put 
in jars. Boil syrup 20 minutes longer and pour hot over tomatoes. Next 
day pour off syrup, reheat and pour over tomatoes, and seal in jars. 

Apple Pickle. — Eighteen gccd sharp apples; one-quarter pound best 
ginger ; one pound Sultana raisins ; one ounce mustard seed ; six shallots ; 
one-quarter pound sail; V/2 pound moist sugar; six good-sized onions; 
one-half ounce small chilli peppers; one-half teaspoon cayenne pepper. 
Three pints white wine vinegar. Pare and quarter apples and place in a 
double boiler, cover tightly to keep in steam, cook till quite soft; chop 
onions and shallots, and boil in vinegar until they are soft also. Then 
mix ingredients together, and place in an iron saucepan, no other metal 
will do. Roil for three-quarters of an hour, stirring faithfully, as it 
burns very quickly. Put down in small pots well sealed. This pick^.e 
will remain good for years. It should stand two months before using. 

Sweet Apple Pickle. — Three pounds of sugar to seven of cored 
apples, and one pint of vinegar. Steam the apples till tender, but not 
too much ; stick a clove or two in every quarter. Make a syrup of the 
sugar and vinegar and pour while hot over the apples. May be kept in 
a well-covered jar in a cool place, and keep well. 

String Beans. — Cut the ends off the tiny pods and remove the little 
beginnings of "strings," pack in glass jars, and pour in the boiling spiced 
and sweetened vinegar just as if making sweet pickled pears or peaches. 
If white wine vinegar is used the beans will retain their vivid green 
color and thus make a pretty as well as a delicious relish. 

Beets, Canned. — Select small, dark-red beets-, about the size of a 
peach or smaller, boil in the usual way. being careful not to break the 
skins in washing ; do not cut the tops too close and be sure not to cut 
the ends off. Boil in salted water until tender, but not too soft. Rub 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 15T 

the skins off as soon as they are cool enough to handle, also cut off 
top and tail and pack in fruit jars; set aside and prepare your vinegar. 
It will not be necessary to heat the beets over again. Put as much 
vinegar over the fire as will be required to cover the beets ; when this 
comes to a boil add a little sugar, according to taste. Let the vinegar 
boil five minutes longer ; pour over the beets piping hot and seal. A 
small piece of horseradish put into each jar will keep the white scum 
from forming on the top of the vinegar. 

Beet Relish. — Boil two medium-sized beets until tender, drain and 
let stand in cold water tliree minutes, then skin, slice thin and cover with 
strong vinegar for one hour. Drain off the vinegar and mash the beets 
thoroughly, adding three tablespoons of grated horseradish, a pinch of 
salt and a dash of black pepper. 

Beet Sweet Pickle. — Boil till tender, then skin, and cut into slices or 
strips. Put in glass jars rather loosely, so that each piece will be sur- 
rounded by the pickle. To two quarts of vinegar add four pounds of 
brown sugar, and, when these are in the kettle, add a scant lialf-teaspoon- 
ful of pulverized alum. Use a porcelain-lined kettle for this liquid, and 
bring the contents to a boil. Skim carefully, and then add to it a small 
cheesecloth bag containing a teaspoonful each of whole peppercorns, 
allspice and cloves. Boil again, and add a little cayenne pepper and salt. 
Fill the jars to overflowing with this liquid, and set aside over night. The 
next morning drain the beets, and bring the syrup again to a hard boil. 
Pour this again into the jars of beets, doing so while it is scalding hot, 
and filling each jar to overflowing. Seal immediately. 

Blackberry Pickle. — Put a pint of the best cider vinegar in a granite 
kettle, together with four cupfuls of granulated sugar, one teaspoonful 
of ground cloves, and two teaspoonfuls of ground cinnamon ; when it 
boils add three quarts of dewberries or blackberries that have been care- 
fully cleaned ; let the fruit cock 10 minutes in the syrup, then skim the 
berries into a gallon jar; pour over the syrup and turn a plate over them 
to keep the berries below the surface ; tie a double fold of cloth and 
thick paper over the jar when the fruit is cold and the pickle will 
keep perfectly. 

Cauliflower Pickles. — Two cauliflowers, broken up, cne pint small 
onions, three medium-sized red peppers; dissolve half a pint of salt in 
water sufficient to cover the vegetables, and let stand over night ; drain 
in the morning ; steam the vegetables until tender ; heat two quarts of 
vinegar with three level tablespoonfuls of mustard (less if preferred) 
until it boils; pour over vegetables; bottle and seal. 

Pickled Cherries. — Five pounds of cherries, stoned or not, as pre- 
ferred; one quart of vinegar, two pounds of sugar, one-half ounce of 
cinnamon, one-half ounce of cloves, same amount of mace, all ground. 



158- THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Boil the sugar, vinegar and spices (tie the latter in a bag) together, and 
pour hot over the cherries. 

Spiced Cherries. — Make a syrup by boiling together four pounds of 
granulated sugar, one pint of vinegar, one-half ounce each of cinnamon 
bark and whole cloves. Cook in this till the skin breaks nine pounds 
of firm, ripe cherries. 

Chopped Pickle. — One-half peck green tomatoes, two stalks of celery, 
cne green pepper, one-half a cabbage, three large onions, all chopped, to 
which add one-half a cupful of mustard seed, two tablespoonfuls of 
celery seed, one-half cupful of brown sugar, one-quarter cupful of salt, 
one teaspoonful of black pepper, the same of cinnamon, one saltspoonful 
each of cloves and allspice and one quart of vinegar. Mix all well to- 
gether and seal in Mason jars. Will keep perfectly. 

Chow Chow. — Wash thoroughly and chop without paring half a 
peck of green tomatoes ; chop fine one large head of white cabbage ; pare 
and chop six large cucumbers ; clean thoroughly and cut into small dice 
one bunch of celery and finely chop one large white onion. Mix all 
together, add half a cup of salt and let stand over night. Clean 100 
tiny pickles and fifty small silver-skinned onions; put into separate jars, 
cover with strong salt water and let them stand over night. The next 
morning drain the first mixture thoroughly, wash off the pickles and 
onions and wipe dry. Chop fine one large red mango pepper. Put all 
together into a preserving kettle, add two quarts of the best cider 
vinegar (dilute somewhat if very strong), half a pound of granulated 
sugar, half an ounce each of turmeric and celery seed, one ounce of 
ground mustard seed. Cook 30 minutes, then bottle and seal. 

English Chow Chow. — This calls for two medium-sized heads of 
firm white cabbage, half a peck of green tomatoes, two quarts of firm 
ripe tomatoes, half a dozen green peppers and two red peppers. Chop 
all together as fine as you can, and pack the mixture in layers of salt. 
Put it in a coarse bag of burlap or some rough material. Lay it over a 
rack placed upon a deep keg or jar and put a heavy press upon it. Let it 
drain in this way over night, or for 24 hours. A pint and a half of 
sugar, half a cup of grated horseradish, half a teaspoonful of ground 
black pepper, half an even teaspoonful of ground mustard, an ounce of 
white mustard seed, ^n ounce of celery seed, a tablespoonful of ground 
mace and, finally, a gill of Dutch mustard compose the seasonings and 
must be added to the mixture. After it has drained sufficiently moisten 
the whole with enough good cider vinegar scantily to cover it. This 
chow chow requires no cooking and does not have to be put up in sealed 
jars. A stone crock is all sufficient, if kept in a cold, dry place. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 159 

Virginia Chow Chow. — This is an old recipe. One peck each of 
green and ripe tomatoes, one large, firm head of cabbage, six each of 
green and ripe peppers, six large white onions and two bunches of 
celery. Chop the vegetables fine, sprinkle over them a cupful of coarse 
salt and let them soak 24 hours. Drain all the liquid off, cover with 
best cider vinegar, stir in one pound of dark brown sugar, one-half 
cupful of grated horse-radish, two tablespoonfuls of^ white mustard 
seed, one tablespoouful of ground ginger, one teaspoonful of ground 
cloves and the same amount of allspice. Let the pickle come slowly 
to the boiling point, then remove to the back of the range and let it 
stand for one hour. Seal up in Mason jars, and it will be ready for 
use in a week, but will improve with age. 

Corn and Cabbage. — Cut the kernels from 12 large ears of corn, add 
as much chopped cabbage as there is cut corn, one large sweet pepper 
freed from seeds and chopped, one cupful of brown sugar, two table- 
spoonfuls of salt, one-half tablespoouful of ground mustard and one 
quart of vinegar. Bring all to a boil and then can. 

Corn Relish. — Chop one head of cabbage; sprinkle over it two table- 
spoonfuls of salt and let stand over night. Cut the kernels from 12 
ears of corn ; chop three peppers. Mix all together. Mix with them a 
little celery seed ; grated horseradish, or both if liked, though neither 
are needed to insure the keeping qualities of the relish. Bring two 
quarts of vinegar to boiling heat; add one cup of sugar and a quarter 
of a pound of mustard that has been rubbed smooth in a little cold 
vinegar. Pour this hot dressing over the mixture; stir until well 
mixed; put in glass jars, or small jars. 

Corn Salad. — Eighteen large ears corn, one head cabbage, one-fourth 
pound ground mustard, four red peppers (chopped), one-half cup salt, 
one and two-thirds cup sugar, two quarts vinegar. Corn is shaved from 
cob, cabbage and .peppers chopped and all ingredients thoroughly mixed. 
It is then cooked one hour. By cooking in oven it need not be stirred 
so frequently and there is much less danger of burning. It is canned 
and sealed while hot. 

Pickled Crab Apple. — One quart of vinegar, three pounds brown 
sugar; make this into a syrup. Have the apples in a gallon jar or one 
of size that will set in an iron kettle. Pour .this syrup over them, have 
seasoning tied in small pieces of cheese cloth and cook with the rest. 
Boil in the jar until a fork will go easily into the apples. The juice 
need not cover the fruit at first, the apples help make more. This 
keeps the fruit whole and is very satisfactory; it needs a weight like a 
small plate to keep apples under the liquor. 

Cucumbers in Barrels. — Choose small cucumbers free from spots. 
Put a layer of cucumbers in the bottom of a cask, then a layer of coarse 



160 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

salt, about one-fourth inch thick, then another layer of cucumbers, more 
salt, and so on until all are used. Place a board on top of the pickles, 
with a heavy stone to keep them down. Then pour in about a quart of 
water to moisten the salt, which, with the juice exuding from the cu- 
cumbers should make sufficient brine to cover. Continue to add cu- 
cumbers, as they are gathered, in layers as before; a few cabbage or 
horseradish Icayes on top, under the board, will prevent molding. When 
the cask is full, tuck a cloth closely around the edges, put board and 
weight on top, and cover closely, and the cucumbers will keep for a 
year or two. When cucumbers are wanted for pickling, remove cloth, 
board and stone, and wash them well in warm water; wipe all scum 
from sides of cask with a clean cloth, take out cucumbers, and then 
cover any remaining as before. Soak cucumbers for three days in cold 
water, changing water each day; drain and wipe carefully. Half fill a 
large porcelain-lined preserving kettle with good cider vinegar, put in 
as many cucumbers as the vinegar will cover, with a piece of alum the 
size of a hazelnut; heat to boiling point, stirring with a wooden spoon 
so that they do not soften at bottom of kettle, and then drain, throw- 
ing away the vinegar. Cover with fresh cold vinegar, spice if desired. 
A little chopped horseradish at top will prevent molding. They wnll 
be ready for use in about a week. A great many cucumber pickles are 
sold direct from the brine. 

Brine for Cucumbers. — To six parts of water use one part salt, and 
one part of cider vinegar. Keep the pickles well under the brine, and 
they will keep longer and be more brittle than when laid down in salt, 
in the oM way. 

Pickle for Cucumbers. — One-half ounce of black pepper, one and 
one-half ounce of ginger, one ounce of allspice, one ounce of cloves, 
one ounce of mustard seed, three-fourths of a pound of salt, half a tea- 
spoon cayenne pepper, one ounce ground mustard, one ounce turmeric, 
and six quarts of vinegar. The spices are to be scalded in the vinegar, 
except the mustard and turmeric which should be added when the 
vinegar is cold. For a good pickle without mustard : Put a teacupful 
of salt and a tablespoonful of powdered alum into a gallon of vinegar. 
Pick small cucumbers and pcair a weak brine over them, boiling hot. 
Let stand over night; drain, and put into prepared vinegar. Add cu- 
ciunbers as convenient, and when as many have been put into the vinegar 
as it will cover scald them up, and put into fresh vinegar, to which has 
been added a little red pepper and horseradish. 

Canned Cucumbers. — Cucumbers canned as follows will keep until 
the following June, and are excellent to serve with meat or salad: 
Peel and slice thin medium-sized cucumbers, sprinkle with salt and a 
little alum; let stand two hours; drain and put in jars, adding vinegar 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 161 

enough to cover, pepper and a few whole mustard seeds, the quantity of 
pepper to be governed by the taste, and the whole pepper to be used 
in preference to the ground. On top of the jar, when ready for seal- 
ing, add a dessertspoonful of olive oil. 

Chopped Cucumber Relish. — This is simple and very excellent. Pare 
and chop fine half a peck of medium-sized cucumbers ; chop two medium- 
sized onions. Salt each separately over night, using one-third of a cup 
of salt in all. Drain thoroughly the next morning and mix. If the 
mixture seems too salty cover with cold water and drain a second time. 
Then put into a granite kettle, add a rounding tablespoonful each of 
celery seed and mustard seed, a level tablespoonful of ground mustard, 
one-eighth of a teaspoon of cayenne pepper, half a cup of brown 
sugar and a pint of best vinegar. Boil 10 minutes, then bottle and seal, 

Dill Pickles. — Make a brine strong enough to bear an ^gg, then add 
half as much more water as you have brine. Wash cucumbers in cold 
water, and into a stone jar put first a layer of cucumbers, then a layer 
of grape leaves and a layer of dill, using leaves and stems. Continue 
in this way until the jar is full. Pour the brine over all and cover, first 
with a cloth, then with a plate, and put a weight on top of the plate. 
The cloth must be washed 'frequently as in making sauerkraut. 

Gherkins. — Wipe one quart of small unripe cucumbers. Put in a 
stone crock and add one-quarter cupful of salt dissolved in one pint 
of boiling water. Let stand three days. Drain cucumbers from brine, 
bring the brine to the boiling point, pour over the cucumbers, and again 
let stand three days. Repeat ; drain, wipe cucumbers, and pour over 
one quart of boiling water in which one scant teaspoonful of alum has 
been dissolved. Let stand six hours, then drain from alum water. 
Cook cucumbers 10 minutes, a few at a time, in one-fourth of the fol- 
lowing mixture, heated to the boiling point and boiled 10 minutes : One 
quart of vinegar, one red pepper, one-half stick of cinnamon, one-half 
teaspoonful allspice, one-half tablespoonful of cloves. Strain the re- 
maining liquor over the pickles, which have been put in a stone jar. 
Bring liquor to boiling point before turning it over the pickles. 

Grated Cucumber Pickles. — Take cucumbers fully grown, pare them, 
and if the seeds are large remove them, then grate and drain through 
a colander, and to the pulp left add as much vinegar as there is juice, 
and can. 

Cucumber Mustard Pickles. — To every gallon of water add two pints 
of fine salt, heat scalding hot and pour over the cucumbers. Let stand 
24 hours, pour . off the brine. Heat sufficient vinegar to cover them. 
To every gallon of vinegar add one tablespoonful pulverized alum, pour 
over the cucumbers and cover tight to steam. Put on fresh cabbage 



162 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

jtiaves every other day for a week; heat the vinegar again, put back on 
I acumbers and let stand two or three days. Then take fresh vinegar; 
to every gallon put one teaspoonful of red pepper, one of black pepper, 
one ounce cinnamon sticks, two ounces white mustard seed, one small 
piece ginger root, a small handful of horseradish root, one teaspoonful 
of cloves. Boil the spices in a bag, then pour over pickles. These will 
keep crisp and nice indefinitely if kept under the vinegar, or may be 
bottled and sealed if preferred. 

Oiled Cucumber Pickles. — Pare and slice the cucumbers as for serving. 
For 50 medium-sized ones (these are best, because the seeds are not 
large) make a dressing of one cupful of olive oil, half a cupful of white 
mustard seed, half a cupful of black mustard seed, one tablespoonful 
of celery seed and one quart of vinegar. No cooking is required. Sprin- 
kle the sliced cucumbers with salt, and let them stand over night. In 
the morning drain them thoroughly and cover with the dressing in a 
stone jar. A pint of onions sliced thin may be added. It so, the onions 
should be arranged in alternate layers with the sliced cucumbers and 
salt. Place a weight over the top, let the mixture stand over night, 
and drain as before. 

Quick Pickles. — Gather small cucumbers, wash, and rub off the 
prickles. Pack in a two-quart glass jar, put a tablespoonful of salt on 
top, shaking it down, fill with cold water, put the cover on, and set 
away 24 hours. Then pour off the brine, rinse the cucumbers, and fill 
the jar with cold vinegar. Screw the top on tight, and store in cellar. 
If the vinegar looks white in a few months' time pour a little off the 
top, and fill up with fresh. These pickles are very good, though ex- 
tremely sour. 

Quick Mustard Pickles. — Put a gallon of vinegar and one cupful, 
each, of salt and mustard into a two gallon crock; pick small, quickly 
grown cucumbers; rub off the black specks, and put into vinegar. In 
a few days the pickles are ready for use. Some people add a cup of 
sugar and one of grated horseradish to the above recipe, but it is a 
matter of taste, as neither is necessary to the keeping quality of the 
pickles. Each time cucumbers are added to those in the crock all should 
be well stirred up from the bottom. It is a good plan to put a quart 
of vinegar with its proper proportion of salt and mustard into a two- 
quart glass can, and fill in cucumbers for immediate use. 

Ripe Cucumber Pickles.— Peel and cut ripe cucumbers in rings, 
sprinkle salt on them and let remain over night. Drain off, and cover 
with hot spiced vinegar. 

Salting Cucumbers for Winter. — Secure a small keg and if you have 
cucumbers in your garden gather every other day. Place a layer of 
coarse salt— ice cream salt— in the bottom of the keg, add a cup of water 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 163 

and cover with the cucumbers you have gathered and washed; sprinkle 
over salt to cover. Repeat this as you gather cucumbers from day to 
day, not, however, adding any more water, as the salt should make suf- 
ficient brine. If there should not be brine to cover them you may add 
a little, cautiously. There should always be a layer of salt in the bot- 
tom of the keg undissolved. When you have gathered all the cucumbers 
you wish put two or three fresh horseradish leaves on the top, and if 
you wish you may place a stone on the top to keep the cucumbers under 
the brine. When desired to make pickles take from the brine as many 
as you wish into a stone jar and cover them with boiling water; let 
them stand 24 hours; drain and cover again with boiling water; let 
stand till next day. If you desire them very fresh you may repeat this 
the third time. It is not always necessary. Then pour off the water 
and drain well. To every three quarts of cucumbers take one quart of 
best cider vinegar. To each gallon of vinegar take one teaspoonful 
each of whole cloves, allspice, peppercorns, mace, celery seed and two 
teaspoonfuls of mustard seed. Tie these in a little muslin or cheese- 
cloth bag. (The spices, if scattered through the cucumbers, turn them 
dark.) Add to vinegar two pieces of ginger-root an inch long and 
two tiny red pepper pods, same size. Boil vinegar with spices for one 
minute and pour over the cucumbers. If not enough vinegar to cover, 
add more boiling hot to fill jar. These need not be sealed. Place a 
horseradish leaf on the top of jar; are ready for use in a few days. 
Will keep indefinitely. 

Small cucumber pickles are prepared as follows: Wash and wipe; 
place in jars, and cover with boiling brine, strong enough to bear an ^gg. 
Let stand 24 hours; pour off the brine, wipe, and place in clean jars. 
Cover with hot vinegar, spiced in the proportion of one onion, 12 whole 
cloves, one ounce of mustard seed and three blades of mace to 100 cu- 
cumbers. They will be ready to use in two weeks. 

Sour Cucumber Pickles.— Dissolve one pint of salt in one gallon of 
vinegar; wash the cucumbers and pour over them some boiling water, 
let stand five or ten minutes, then pack closely in cans, pour over the 
salted vinegar and seal. The friend who sends this recipe says the 
pickles are very crisp and nice, and will keep as long as you will let 
them. 

Spiced Cucumber Pickles.— Prepar vinegar for pickles as follows: 
One gallon vinegar, four ounces salt, two ounces cloves, two ounces 
cinnamon, one ounce allspice, one ounce ginger root, one ounce yellow 
mustard seed, one ounce celery seed, small piece of alum. Scald all 
together. This will keep for years. Wash the cucumbers and drain 
until dry, then put them into the vinegar at any time after it is cold. 



]fl4 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

If the vinegar is very sharp add a little water to it before scalding the 
ingredients together, or the pickles will shrivel. 

Sweet Cucumber Pickles. — Let the cucumbers stand in salt water 
three days. Heat the brine once or twice and pour over them. Drain ; 
put in a jar and pour over them hot vinegar with cloves and cinnamon 
in a bag; two-thirds cupful sugar to quart of vinegar; put in plenty 
of horseradish and this will keep sealed or open. Put in a little alum 
to make them brittle. 

Boiled Sweet Cucumber Pickle. — Put cucumbers in cold weak brine 
{V/i cup salt to one gallon Vvater) one day and night. Take out, dry 
on cloth. To one gallon vinegar add two cups sugar, nearly one ounce 
mixed spice. Heat these all boiling hot. Put in pickles and let boil 
up once. Put in cans immediately and pour the hot vinegar over them. 
They are nice and sweet, and will keep a long time, till eaten. These 
will not shrivel if you follow directions. One gallon vinegar will cover 
two gallons cucumbers. 

Steamed Sweet Cucumber Pickle. — Peel, steam as soft as liked and 
let stand over night in a weak brine. Next morning drain, put on 
vinegar enough to cover, and let stand over night. Again in the morn- 
ing drain off the liquid part. Now take one pint of fresh vinegar, three 
pounds of sugar and one ciiuce of cassia buds (no other spices). When 
this comes to the boiling point put in the cucumbers, let scald up and then 
pack away in stone jars. 

Tested Cucumber Pickles. — Wash and fill two-quart can with freshly 
picked cucumbers of any desired size. Add to them two heaping table- 
spoonfuls dry mustard; two heaping tablespoonfuls salt, and fill can 
with good cold cider vinegar. It doesn't matter whether you have an 
airtight top or not; a cork with cloth tied over, or put in crock. If 
you like more mustard or salt it will do no harm. 

Pickles Without Cooking. — One cupful of sugar, one cupful salt, one 
goodsized root of horseradish, one tablespoonful alum, one tablespoonful 
white mustard seed, one gallon vinegar, mixed spice to taste. Boil the 
above ingredients. Then allow the prepared vinegar to become cold 
before putting in the cucumbers. Use the smallest pickles, as the large 
ones do not always become thoroughly pickled, but for the small ones 
this way ot preparing them is excellent. 

Spiced Currants. — IMake a syrup of three pounds of sugar, one pint 
of vinegar and water, half ?nd half, two tablespoonfuls of cinnamon, 
one tablespoonful of cloves, half a teaspoonful of salt; add six pounds 
of washed, stemmed currants and boil half an hour. Seal in jars. 

Pickled Damsons. — This is a sweet pickle, and very good served 
with mutton or venison. Ingredients required : Three pounds damsons, 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 165 

one quart of vinegar, three pounds moist sugar, one-half ounce cinna- 
mon, three blades of mace, one-quarter ounce allspice. The plums 
should be ripe, but not too much so ; the bloom is rubbed off with a 
piece of flannel or a clean cloth, and they are pricked a little with a 
needle. The vinegar, sugar and spices are boiled together for 10 min- 
utes, then strained and poured over the fruit, in a large basin Next 
day the vinegar is boiled again, and again poured over the damsons, 
and on the third day the damsons themselves are simmered in the 
vinegar for exactly five minutes. They should be tied down while hot. 
A quicker method of pickling either plums or damsons is the following : 
Remove the stalks from the fruit ; wipe it and arrange in layers in a 
jar with good brown sugar sprinkled between. Fill up the jars with 
cold vinegar, tie them down and bake in rather a slow oven till the 
plums are tender^ then tie down for use. 

French Mustard. — Take six ounces of salt, four ounces of scraped 
horseradish, one clove of garlic, and two quarts of boiling vinegar; 
steep these together in a covered vessel for six hours, then strain and 
add mustard to the spiced vinegar sufficient to make it the proper con- 
sistency. These proportions are large ; they can be reduced if necessary, 
but the mustard will keep a long time, as it is made with boiling vinegar. 

Gillespie Relish. — Ore peck ripe tomatoes, two cupfuls celery, six 
large onions, seven red peppers. Run the peeled tomatoes and the 
onions through a meat grinder. Chop the celery and the peppers fine. 
Add two ounces of mustard seed and ground cinnamon, one-half cupful 
of salt, three pints cider vin.^gar and two pounds of light brown sugar. 
Mix and seal. Do not cook. It is claimed that this will keep per- 
fectly for five years, and it is very appetizing and universally liked. 

Hebrew Pickle. — For a pint of pickles grate two roots of horse- 
radish. Mix with it two tablespoonfuls of celery seed, three tablespoon- 
fuls of mustard seed, four tablespoonfuls of sugar and one tablespoonful 
of turmeric. Cover the ingredients with scalding hot vinegar. Seal in 
glass jars. Let stand one week before using. 

India Relish. — This recipe calls for gherkins, large cucumbers, small 
onions, cabbage and red peppers. Green nasturtium seeds may be added. 
Cut the vegetables all into small pieces and put the mixture, layer by 
layer, into a stone jar, separating the layers with salt. Sprinkle the top 
well with salt, cover with a plate weighted with a flatiron, stone or 
brick, and let the jar and contents stand for three days. At the end of 
that time drain off the liquid and rinse the vegetables thoroughly in 
cold water. Then cover with fresh cold water and leave for 36 hours. 
In the meantime scald three-quarters of a gallon of cider vinegar with 
half a tablespoonful each of celery seed, paprika, cloves, mace, ground 
mustard and horseradish and two tablespoonfuls of curry. Add one

and three-quarters cupful of brown sugar. Turn the vinegar over the 
drained vegetables and cook for a quarter of an hour. Put the relish 
into a stone jar and leave it for two or three days. Then drain off the 
vinegar, scald it and pour it while hot over the vegetables. Let it 
stand until the next day, then fill into small jars, cover closely and 
keep in a cool dark place. 

India Relish No. 2. — This comes from the South. Two pounds of 
citron melon or Avatermelon rind, two heads of cabbage, white and firm; 
six white onions, one large cupful of sugar, one heaping teaspoonful 
each of ground cinnamon, mace, paprika (Hungarian sweet pepper), 
mustard and powdered alum, one tablespoonful of curry powder, one 
quart of vinegar, two tablespoonfuls of celery seed, one tablespoonful 
of salt. Prepare the melon by cutting off the green rind and scraping 
away the softer inner coating, leaving less than an inch firm and white. 
Cut into thin strips, put into a porcelain-lined kettle, cover with cold 
water and sprinkle a tablespoonful of powdered alum over it. Cover 
closely and cook gently for three hours. Drain well and cover with 
ice water. Change the water twice in four hours, and then wipe the 
melon dry. Cut the cabbage into quarters, cook in boiling water slightly 
salted for fifteen minutes. Let it get perfectly cold. Parboil the 
onions, and allow them also to get cold and stiff. Now chop cabbage, 
melons and onions separately and very fine. Mix all together in a large 
crock and pour over them the scalding hot vinegar, in which have been 
boiled for one minute the spices, sugar and celery seed. Leave the 
crock covered 24 hours. Strain off the vinegar, bring it to a boil and 
pour again over the mixture in the crock. Repeat this for three days 
in succession, after which pack in small jars, cover closely and set away 
to ripen. It will be ready for use in six weeks, but improves by keeping. 

Pickled Mangoes. — Young musk, or nutmeg melons are needed for 
the purpose. Through a slit in the side of the melon extract all the 
seeds with the fingers without breaking the fruit. In case the patience 
gives out, a plug can be cut out, saved and replaced, but it is better to 
make only the slit. Keep the melons in strong brine for three days, 
then drain them and let them remain in pure water for 24 hours. Heat 
slowly in vinegar, in which alum has been dissolved, until the melons are 
green. For a gallon of vinegar a piece of alui^i half the size of a 
hickorynut will be wanted. The following is the recipe for the stuf- 
fing, given in an old cook book: One handful of horseradish scraped; 
two handfuls of English mustard seed, twq teaspoonfuls of chopped 
garlic, one teaspoonful of ground nutmeg and mace, one dozen whole 
peppercorns, one teaspoonful of ground ginger, half a tablespoonful of 
ground mustard, one teaspoonful of sugar, one teaspoonful of celery 
seed and one tablespoonful of olive oil. Fill the greened mangoes 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 167 

through the slit with the mixture. Sew up the slit, or tie the melon 
securely so that it will not open. Pack the mangoes in a big stone jar 
and pour scalding vinegar over them. After two days, drain off the 
vinegar, scald and return it to the jar, and repeat twice at intervals 
of two days. The mangoes will be ready for use in four or five 
months. 

Minced Pickle. — Chop half a peck of green tomatoes, cover them with 
two-thirds "of a cupful of salt and let them stand for a day and a 
night. Then scald half a gallon of vinegar with a tablespoonful of 
pepper, a tablespoonful and a half each of ground mustard, allspice, 
cinnamon and cloves and half a cupful of white mustard seed. Add to 
the tomatoes two onions chopped fine and four large green peppers de- 
nuded of seeds and cut into rings. Turn the vinegar over the mixture 
and boil steadily 20 minutes ; then bottle. 

Mixed Pickle. — Three hundred small cucumbers, two heads of cauli- 
flower, one of cabbage, six green peppers with seeds taken out, three 
quarts small onions and two quarts small beans. Cut the cabbage and 
the cauliflower in small pieces, and put all in a brine strong enough to 
bear up an tgg. Let them remain 24 hours, then rinse and drain thor- 
oughly. Place on the stove two gallons of vinegar, add a large root 
of horseradish, grated, two ounces each of mustard seed and black pep- 
per, one teaspoon cayenne, and one ounce of turmeric. Let it boil and 
pour over pickles in a jar. When cold mix in one cupful of mustard 
wet with cold vinegar. 

Mixed Pickle No. 2. — One-half medium-sized head of cabbage, four 
celery roots, four tablespoonfuls grated horseradish, six large green 
tomatoes, one large or two small Spanish onions, 1^ quart of vinegar, 
one-fourth teaspoonful of powdered alum. Chop all the vegetables and 
mix them together. Put a layer about two inches thick in the bottom 
of a jar, sprinkle it with a tablespoonful of salt, then another layer of 
vegetables and salt, and so on until all is used. Allow it to stand 24 
hours, then drain, and press out all the liquor; cover with boiling 
water, allow it to stand 10 minutes, then press with the hands until 
entirely dry. Add to one quart of vinegar ^4 teaspoonful of alum, and 
stir until dissolved. Put a layer of the pickles two inches thick in the 
bottom of a jar, sprinkle with mustard seed, black pepper, and the 
grated horseradish; then another layer of pickle, and so on until used. 
Pour the vinegar over, let it stand two days, and it is ready for use. 

Mock Olives. — Two quarts of green plums, 1^ tablespoonful mus- 
tard seed, 25^ tablespoonfuls salt, two quarts vinegar. Place the plums 
in a stone jar with mustard seed and salt; turn the vinegar into a pre- 
serving kettle, bring to a boil and pour over plums. Cover closely. 



168 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Next day drain off the vinegar, bring again to a boil and pour over 
plums while hot. If plums arc large repeat the third morning. When 
cold place all in olive bottles and cork tightly. They will taste like 
real olives. 

Muskmelon Pickles. — Pare the rind off ripe, spicy, green melons, re- 
move the seeds and cut into thick slices. Weigh as for peaches, seven 
pounds of fruit to three and- one-quarter pounds of sugar, and put the 
sugar to cook with water enough to dissolve it. Boil and skim it until 
clear, then pour it over the melon in a crock. Repeat this for three 
mornings, but on the third morning add a cupful of vinegar to each 
three pints of syrup and boil it up with a cupful of spices in a bag. 
Pour it over the melon in jars and seal at once. 

Mustard Pickles.— Two quarts small cucumbers, one quart small 
onions, one quart green tomatoes, one large cauliflower, six green pep- 
pers, quartered. Lay in weak brine twenty-four hours, then scald in 
same water and drain. .Paste — six tablespoonfuls English mustard, one 
tablespoonful tumeric, one and one-half cup of sugar, one small cup 
of flour, two quarts best cider vinegar. IMix dry ingredients thor- 
oughly, add vinegar, boil a few minutes, pour over pickles and bottle. 

Mustard Pickles Xc. 2. — This differs from most recipes for this 
pickle in being made without green tomato. Put one-half peck small 
encumbers, two quarts silver skinned onions, and two heads of picked 
cauliflower to soak in water to cover and a cupful of salt over night. In 
the morning drain ; mix one dessertspoonful of turmeric powder with 
three-quarters of a pound of the best mustard; wet with sufficient 
vinegar to mix without lumps. Put three quarts of vinegar over the 
fire, add five cents' worth of mixed pickling spices, one-half ounce 
celery seed, one-half ounce v/hite mustard seed, one teaspoonful each 
of cinnamon and cloves, one pound of brown sugar, carefully stir in 
the mustard and turmeric paste and let boil up well; then add the 
mixed pickles, two red peppers chopped with the seeds of same, and 
stir all together. After it begins to bubble let boil well for five minutes. 

Mustard Pickles No. 3. — Equal quantities of cucumbers, celery, cauli- 
flower and small button onions. Cut all in small pieces except the 
onions. Cover with strongly-salted water for 24 hours ; drain, put into 
a jar, and pour on hot vinegar (not too strong) sufficient to cover. Let 
the pickles stand three days, and then drain. To five quarts of the 
pickle use thres quarts of cider vinegar, one cupful of sugar, and two 
tablespoonfuls of butter. Heat to boiling, then stirring constantly (for 
fear of burning) add one cupful of flour, six tablespoonfuls of ground 
mustard and one-half ounce of turmeric powder wetted in cold vinegar. 
Stir till smooth, and pour over the pickle while hot; stir well. When 
cold cover close. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. m 

Sliced Mustard Pickles. — One dozen large cucumbers sliced, two 
dozen very small cucumbers, one quart of small onions, one large cauli- 
flower, steamed slightly. Soak all these ingredients in cold brine over 
night. Paste for the pickles is made as follows: One-half pound of 
ground yellow mustard, one tcacupful of flour, one teacupful of sugar, 
one-half ounce of turmeric. Rub the above ingredients together with a 
little vinegar until smooth. Then add three quarts of vinegar, letting 
it scald until a thick paste. Next add one-half ounce of celery seed, 
and pour the hot paste over the pickles, put in cans and seal. 

Nasturtium Pods Pickled. — Put the pods to soak in weak brine 
for two days, then in fresh water one day; drain, put in a jar, and 
cover with boiling vinegar. The vinegar m.ay be spiced if desired, but 
if the pods are to be used in sauce they are better unspiced. 

Pickled Onions. — First pour boiling water over the onions to loosen 
the skins. As soon as cool enough to handle begin to peel, dropping 
the onions as peeled into salt water (not brine) to prevent their being 
discolored. Make a strong brine, heat to the boiling point, and pour 
ever the onions. Leave them in the brine 48 hours, then drain. Spice 
vinegar according to taste, I'Cat 1o boiling point, and pour over the 
onions. Set away for two or three days, drain off the vinegar, heat it 
again, and pour it over the onions in the jars in which they are to be 
stored; tie up the jars and set away. 

Pickled Peaches. — For pickling select medium-sized peaches, ripe and 
firm. Rub off the down with a piece of flannel. To eight pounds of 
fruit use four pounds of granulated sugar, one quart of vinegar, two 
ounces of stick cinnamon. Boii the sugar, vinegar and cinnamon for five 
minutes. Then put in the peaches carefully, a few at a time. If one 
likes cloves, two or three may be stuck in each peach. When the 
peaches arc done enough to be easily pricked with a fork, take them out 
and put in the jar. When the peaches are all cooked boil the syrup 
till a little thick, pour over peaches and seal cans or jars. 

Sweet Pickled Peaches. — Cut the peaches in two, remove the stones, 
and close the openings with halves together, pack in jars, and cover with 
the following liquid: To two pounds of sugar add one pint of vinegar 
(best cider vinegar alone should be used for all pickles), tie in a bag 
a teaspoonful of whole cloves, one-half teaspoonful cassia buds, three 
sticks of cinnamon (broken) and some tiny bits of ginger, allspice and 
nutmeg (about a teaspoonful in all). Scald three times and seal the 
jars. Keep in dark, dry place; when ready to use remove the spice. 

Sweet Pickled Pears. — Select ripe but firm fruit, peel and measure 
out for every seven pounds of fruit four of white sugar, one pint of soft 
vinegar and half a tablespoonful each of whole cloves, whole allspice 



170 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

and cinnamon sticks. Put the pears in a kettle and over each layer 
sprinkle sugar until both are exhausted. Heat slowly until the boiling 
point is reached, then add the vinegar and spice and boil five minutes. 
Take out the fruit with a perforated skimmer and spread upon platters 
to cool. Boil the syrup till thick. Heat the jars, pack in the pears 
and pour the syrup over boiling hot; seal. 

Pepper Hash. — Wash and dry five large green peppers and one red 
one, remove seeds and chop shells quite fine; chop fine a good-sized 
cabbage, and place with the peppers in a bowl, mixing well. Add two 
tablespoonfuls of brown mustard seed, three tablespoonfuls of salt and 
enough good cider vinegar to cover the whole. Stir well together and 
put into pickle bottles. Ready for use in two days, or will keep for 
Winter use. 

Pepper Mangoes. — Two dozen full-grown pods of red pepper. Cut 
out the stems with a sharp knife and scrape out the seeds. Lay the pods 
in brine and let soak for 24 hours. Drain. Make a dressing of finely 
chopped cabbage, enough to fill the peppers, seasoned with one table- 
spoonful each of salt and pulverized mustard seed, one teaspoonful of 
grated horseradish, one teaspoonful of black pepper and one tablespoon- 
ful of made mustard. When well mixed stuff the peppers, sew the 
stems on with a coarse thread, pack in a stone jar, cover with strong 
vinegar and let stand two weeks before using. 

Pickled Peppers. — Put two dozen green peppers in a bowl and pour 
over them a very strong brine. Put a weight over them to keep them 
under the water and let them lie for two days. Drain them, make a 
small incision in the side of each to let out the water, wipe them with 
a soft cloth and put them in a stone jar, with one-half ounce of whole 
allspice, one-half ounce of whole cloves and a small lump of alum. Pour 
cold vinegar over them and tie a bladder securely over the jar. Pickled 
in this way the peppers should preserve their color. 

Pepper Relish. — Remove the seeds from six large green peppers and 
one red bell pepper, and chop the peppers fine. Mix the peppers with 
a finely minced head of cabbage. Turn in a little less than a quarter 
of a cupful of salt, a full cupful of sugar, two tablespoonfuls of mus- 
tard seed and nice cider vinegar enough to cover the mixture. Stir 
thoroughly and bottle. 

Piccalilli. — Two pecks of green tomatoes, two heads of white cab- 
bage, 12 large onions, four green peppers, two red peppers, one good 
root of horseradish (grated), one tablespoonful each of cinnamon, nut- 
meg and allspice. Chop all fine, stir in two cups of salt and let stand 
all night, then drain; cover with cold vinegar, boil 10 minutes and drain 
again. Cover with vinegar, add the spices and three pounds of brown 
sugar. Boil a few minutes and put away in jars. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 171 

Canned Pimentos.— These are simply red peppers, the long, tapering, 
sharp-pointed sweet variety. They repay one for the trouble, as they 
retail at 15 cents a can, and in glass jars at 35 cents per quart. Select 
ripe red ones, neither dry nor woody. Cut off stem end and extract the 
seeds. Drop in a jar and cover with brine that will float an tgg. Let 
stand three days. Wash in several waters, cover with clear water one 
day, then drain well. Place peppers in cans, fill to overflowing with 
boiling water, add a level tablespoonful of salt to each quart of water; 
place in a boiler on two-inch layer of straw, weight cans to prevent 
tipping, pour in boiling water to cover two-thirds of the can, screw 
lids on loosely and cover the boiler. When the water boils simmer 10 
minutes, remove and seal. They are used in salads, as a relish with 
cold meats or are stuffed with rice, macaroni or bread crumbs. 

Pumpkin Pickle. — This is very good when there is a scarcity of 
apples. Pare the pumpkins carefully, leaving out all soft or stringy 
parts, then cut into pieces about one or two inches square. Soak over 
night in vinegar, salt and water, just enough vinegar and salt to make 
a good flavor. The next day make a pickle as you would for any nice 
pickle and let them simmer on the back of the stove for a long time 
without stirring. Our rule for pickle is seven pounds fruit, four pounds 
sugar and one pint of vinegar. We usually flavor the pumpkin pickle 
with either sliced lemon or ginger root. 

Quince Sweet Pickles. — Scrub with a small vegetable brush to re- 
move the down, wipe dry and cut out any spots or decayed portions. 
Slice, without paring, into rounds a fourth of an inch thick, leaving in 
both core and seeds, unless imperfect, then weigh. Put the fruit, a 
thin layer at a time, in a steamer or colander over boiling water, cover 
closely and steam until it is perfectly tender, then place in a stone 
jar. Make the syrup of four pounds of sugar, a pint of vinegar of 
medium strength, a pint of the water over which the fruit was steamed. 
an ounce of stick cinnamon, a heaping tablespoonful of allspice berries 
and a level tablespoonful of whole cloves to seven pounds of the fruit. 
Pour over the fruit, cover securely and stand in a cool place over 
night. The next morning drain off the syrup, boil for 10 minutes with 
the spice bag, skim and pour again boiling hot over the fruit. Continue 
this process for three successive mornings. The last morning add the 
fruit to the syrup and spices and boil gently until heated through, then 
skim out and put into the crock. Continue to boil the syrup until it is 
as thick as molasses. If, after the second boiling, it does not seem 
spiced sufficiently, add more spices tied in a fresh bag. When the syrup 
is done, reheat the quinces in it, then fill into self-sealing glass jars as 
in canning. 

Red Cabbage Pickle.— Cut a red cabbage of good size into six pieces, 



172 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

sprinkle it with salt and leave it for a day and a night. Then drain off 
the liquid, rinse it with cold water and let it soak in fresh cold water. 
Scald half a gallon of vinegar with a dozen w^hole cloves and white pep- 
pers and a few blades of mace broken fine. Turn in half a cupful of 
sugar and two or three tablespoonfuls of celery seed. Cook slowdy for 
a quarter of an hour. Have the cabbage, drained and dried, packed into 
a stone jar. Turn the hot vinegar over it and put it in a cool place. 
The cabbage will be at its best in two months. 

Spanish Sauce. — One peck green tomatoes, one quart onions, six 
large sweet peppers, four quarts ripe tomatoes, two heads celery chopped 
fine, two pounds brown sugar, one gallon vinegar, one teaspoonful 
cayenne pepper, three tablespoonfuls cinnamon, one tablespoonful each 
of allspice, mace and cloves. Chop green tomatoes, onions and seeded 
peppers, salt and let stand over night. In the morning strain through 
a cloth until perfectly dry. Then mix all the ingredients and boil until 
tender, . 

Tomato Conserve. — Cut five large sound tomatoes into pieces and 
cook them until they are tender, with two onions in which three or 
four cloves have been stuck, tw^o bay leaves and salt and pepper to 
taste. Then turn the fruit on to a fine sieve placed over a bowl and 
drain off the juice. Boil the juice until it has been half reduced. Next 
remove the onions and bay leaves from the tomatoes left on the sieve 
and press the pulp through the fine meshes. Add to it the juice, put 
the mixture into wide mouthed bottles ; cover them loosely and stand 
them in a kettle of warm water (it should be about their own tem- 
perature). Bring the water to a boil and boil for half an hour. Leave 
the bottles in the kettle until they are cool, then tighten their covers 
and set them in the dark. 

Egg Tomatoes in Sweet Pickle. — Pour scalding water over seven 
pounds of the egg tomatoes, let them stand for a moment, then remove 
the skin. Cover them with vinegar much diluted with water and let 
them stand 12 hours. Put one-half cupful of weak vinegar in the pre- 
serving kettle and add part of the tomatoes, then some sugar and any 
whole spices, such as ginger, allspice, cinnamon, cloves and mace, using 
these or even more varieties according to taste. Add more of the to- 
matoes, more sugar and more spices, alternating the layers thus until 
all the tom.atoes and five pounds of sugar have been used. Cook very 
gently, stirring just enough to prevent scorching without breaking the 
tomatoes. When these are quite clear and transparent, remove them 
carefully and boil down the syrup. When the syrup is thick strain it 
and add the tomatoes. Boil up once and pour into pint jars to be sealed 
at once. 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 173 

French Sweet Pickle. — One peck green tomatoes chopped and six 
large onions sliced. Salt them and let stand over night. Then drain off 
the watery part and cover v/ith vinegar, add two teaspoons of baking 
soda dissolved in a little water, and let the whole boil for 15 minutes. 
Take two pounds of brown sugar, two ounces of cinnamon, one ounce 
of ground cloves and one-half pound of white mustard seed and mix 
dry. Put this in the kettle v/ith three quarts of vinegar. Once more 
drain the tomato of its liquid part, add it to the spice and vinegar and 
cook for an hour. 

Green Tomato Chili Sauce. — Slice the green tomatoes and salt down 
as you do e:gg plant, put a weight on them and let stand until morn- 
ing, then rinse in cold water to take out the salt and wash out the seeds 
and bitter juice of the green tomato. For 12 tomatoes take four sweet 
green peppers, half dozen chili peppers, one large onion, one cupful 
vinegar, one tablespoonful sugar, two teaspoonfuls of salt, one of pep- 
per, two of ground allspice, half teaspoonful of mace, one of cinnamon, 
one of cloves. Chop the tomatoes fme, boil 20 minutes, strain and press 
through a sieve. Chop the peppers and onions very fine, first taking out 
the seeds of the peppers. Boil all together for 10 minutes; add spices, 
then bottle and seal. 

Green Tomato Chow Chow. — Chop fine one peck of green tomatoes, 
three onions, six green peppers ; sprinkle them lightly with salt, let stand 
an hour, then scald in the juices. Put three quarts of vinegar in a 
porcelain-lined kettle with one pint of sugar and a few pieces of horse- 
radish root. Boil for five minutes, add the tomatoes and boil five 
minutes longer, put into stone jars, cover and set in cool, dry place. 
Whole cloves, mace and stick cinnamon may be added to this if you want 
a spiced pickle. 

Easy Green Tomato Pickle. — Slice the tomatoes and allow them to 
stand in weak salt brine over night. In the morning rinse and pack 
directly in fruit jars. Place the jars uncovered in the steamer and steam 
for about two hours. Plave ready at the end of that time a sweet-spiced 
vinegar made exactly as you do for pickling peaches, and after draining 
all the juice that cooks from the sliced tomatoes, fill the cans brim-full 
with it and seal as in canning anything. 

Green Tomato Sweet Pickle. — Wash the tomatoes and let drain, then 
slice into a large earthen dish, sprinkling salt between the layers. Let 
stand till next day. Pour off the brine and juice, rinse off with clear 
water, let the fruit drain, then weigh if you like to follow the exact 
rule. To a syrup made of brown sugar and a little water add ginger 
root, cloves and cinnamon bark. Also tie up two or three little bags of 
mixed, ground spices to cook with the rest. Add the tomato and a 
handful of nasturtium seeds, and cook till the tomato seems tender. 



174 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

The nasturtium seeds should be not more than half grown, green, and 
if in clusters, so much the better. Skim out the tomato into a stone 
jar, add a liberal quantity of vinegar to the juice left in the kettle, and 
when it boils up pour over the contents of the jar. 

Green Tomato Mangoes. — Select smooth tomatoes of good shape 
and showing no signs of ripening. Cut across one-fourth of the length 
below the stem and carefully extract the seeds and pulp. Have ready 
a filling composed of two parts finely chopped cabbage and one part 
onions, also chopped fine, and season to taste with celery and mustard 
seeds, pepper and sugar. Fill the tomato shells as full as possible and 
tie the tops firmly on with strong cord. Let the mangoes lie over night 
in very strong brine, then scak them for 24 hours in weak vinegar. 
Pack in a stone jar, leaving plenty of space above them, and fill the jar 
with three parts vinegar to one part water, sweetened to the taste. 
These mangoes may be made either sweet or sour as preferred. A few 
pieces of horseradish root will season and preserve the vinegar. 

Tomato soy is made with both green and ripe fruit. The following 
is an excellent tested recipe for ripe tomato soy: Peel and chop a 
peck of ripe tomatoes until they are quite fine. Then put them upon 
the fire in a preserving kettle with a half a teacupful of whole cloves ; 
the same quantity of whole allspice; a scant teacupful of salt; a table- 
spoonful of black pepper, and three red pepper and five onions, all of 
which have been chopped fine. Let the ingredients boil together for fully 
an hour, and immediately add a quart of the best cider vinegar. When 
the soy has cooled sufficiently, it may be bottled. 

Green Tomato Soy. — One peck green tomatoes ; one quart onions, salt 
and vinegar as desired ; one teaspoonful ground cloves ; one tea- 
spoonful ginger; one teaspoonful cinnamon; the same of black pepper; 
^ teaspoonful red pepper; '-^ pound brown sugar; half a grated nut- 
meg. Wash the tomatoes and cut in slices, also the onions. Place a 
layer of tomatoes and then sprinkle with salt, next a layer of onions in 
the same way — until all are done. Let stand over night. In the morn- 
ing drain well and then put on the stove to cook, covering the prepara- 
tion with vinegar. Add the spices and let it boil slowly together four 
or five hours; then bottle hoi, leaving the covers off the jars till the 
next day. 

Tomato Mustard. — To one peck of ripe tomatoes add two teaspoon- 
fuls of salt and stew half an hour; then pass through a sieve. Add 
two dessertspoonfuls of finely chopped onions, one dessertspoonful each 
of whole pepper, allspice and cloves tied in a muslin bag, and half a 
teaspoonful of cayenne; simmer down one-third, then stir in a tea- 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 176 

spoonful of curry powder and a teacupful of mustard; simmer half an 
hour longer, then bottle. 

Ripe Tomato Pickle. — Mix in the order given one and a half pints 
of firm ripe tomatoes, peeled and chopped, one-half cupful of chopped 
celery, two tablespoonfuls of chopped red pepper, two tablespoonfuls of 
chopped onion, two tablespoonfuls of salt, three tablespoonfuls of sugar, 
three tablespoonfuls of mustard seed, one-quarter teaspoonful of cloves, 
one-half teaspoonful of cinnamon, one-half teaspoonful of grated nut- 
meg and one cupful of vinegar. Stir thoroughly, put in a stone jar and 
cover. It should stand one week before using, but may be kept one 
year. 

Green Tomato Pickle. — Slice very thinly one peck of green to- 
matoes and two quarts of onions, sprinkling them all with a little salt, 
and let them stand till next day. Now drain them through a colander, 
put them on with enough good vinegar to cover them, and boil very 
gently till clear and tender. Then drain them from the vinegar. Put 
into about the same quantity of fresh vinegar two pounds of brown 
sugar, one -half pound of white mustard seed, one-half ounce of ground 
mace, one tablespoonful each of celery seed and ground cloves, and boil 
them all together for a few minutes; then pour it over the drained to- 
matoes, which have been previously mixed with one dessertspoonful of 
cayenne, one full teaspoonful each of ground mustard and of tur- 
meric; mix this all well together, add about half a pint of good salad 
oil, and, when cold, put it into jars. 

Sour Green Tomato Pickle. — Peel green tomatoes and to each quart 
add three small cucumbers, one pint small white onions, two green pep- 
pers, quarter of a pound of salt, and half a pound of mustard seed. 
Chop all fine, mix and set away in a jar for twenty-four hours; then 
cover with good vinegar and place bits of horseradish root on toip. 
Cover, but do not seal. 

Tomato Puree. — Break ripe sound tomatoes in halves and crush them 
as they heat slowly. When they are tender strain and push the pulp 
through a sieve, season with salt and pepper and turn into glass jars. 
Put the cover on loosely, stand the jars in a pan of warm water and 
boil for half an hour. Then screw the covers on firmly. Use for mak- 
ing soups or gravies. 

Spiced Tomatoes. — Put into a preserving pan four pounds of good 
red tomatoes, two pounds of brown sugar, one pint of good vinegar 
(cider vinegar if possible), and one-half ounce each of cloves and stick 
cinnamon. Stew this altogether very gently till the tomatoes are cooked, 
but not broken; then lift them out and set them aside to cool. Con- 
tinue simmering very slowly till it is as thick" as syrup. When the toma- 



176 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

toes are quite cold, reheat them gently in the syrup and again lift them 
out, packing them, when perfectly cold, in jars, pouring the thick 
syrup (also quite cold) over them, and cover tight. 

Virginia Pickle. — This is uncooked. In a three-gallon jar mix one 
gallon of strong vinegar, one-half pint of salt, three pounds of hrown 
sugar, two ounces each of black pepper, brown ginger, celery seed, mus- 
tard seed, mace, cloves, horseradish and allspice, one-half box of ground 
mustard, a little red pepper and one-half dozen pepper pods. Peel three 
dozen onions and put them with fresh cucumbers, just from the vine, 
washed and wiped dry, into the spiced vinegar, using enough cucumbers to 
fill the jar. Agitate the pickles every other morning for several months 
or until cool weather comes. Then add more sugar until the pickles 
have a pleasant taste. 

Pickled Walnuts.— The walnuts must be gathered while young and 
green, and be laid in strong brine. Leave them in this for a week, 
changing it every other day. Take them out, dry them between two 
cloths and pierce each with a large needle. Throw them into cold 
water and leave them several hours before packing them in small jars 
and pouring over them scalding hot seasoned vinegar, prepared in the 
following proportions: Four quarts of vinegar, one cupful of sugar, 
three dozen cloves, three dozen black peppers, 18 whole allspice and 12 
blades of mace boiled together for five minutes. 

Yellow Mustard Pickle.— One-half gallon vinegar, three dozen sliced 
cucumbers, three dozen onions, one tablespoonful turmeric, one table- 
spoon mustard, one-half cup each of sugar and flour, and one-third 
teaspoon of red pepper. Pare and slice cucumbers and onions, cover 
with water, add one-half cup salt and let stand over night. In the 
morning drain the cucumbers and onions; put vinegar on the stove to 
boil, mix the spices, sugar and flour in a little cold vinegar, add to the 
boiling vinegar and let boil five minutes, stirring constantly; then put 
in cucumbers and onions, boil 15 minutes and seal in jars while hot. 

Vinegar for Yellow Pickles. — This may be used for cucumbers, to- 
matoes or any other vegetable desired. Use one-half pound of grated 
horseradish, one pound of white mustard seed, one-half pound of black 
mustard seed, one ounce each of mace, nutmegs, cloves, allspice and 
ground white pepper, two ounces of turmeric, one-half cupful of ground 
mustard, two tablespoonfuls of celery seed, four cloves of garlic, one- 
quarter pound of ground ginger and two pounds of brown sugar. Puf 
in a three-gallon jar with two gallons of vinegar. Stir frequently and let 
remain for several weeks before using. This will keep any length of 
time. Half quantity may be prepared for the use of a small family. 

Corn Vinegar.— A friend says she prefers this to cider vinegar: 
One pint corn cut from cob; one pint of brown sugar or molasses, to

one gallon of rain water. Put in a large jar. Keep covered with a 
cloth. Set in the sun. In a month you will have good vinegar. 

Fruit Vinegars. — Among suggestions for making vinegar given by a 
correspondent of Good Housekeeping, it is stated that half-gallon fruit 
jars are better than stone jugs to make it in, as a larger surface is 
exposed to the light and air, and by shaking often, oxygenation, souring, 
is hastened. A cloth should, of course, be tied over the top to keep out 
insects and dust. The jars should be set in the sun, and- whenever the 
fluid has worked clear, strain off and leave it in a warm place until it is 
as sharp as desired. When mother forms, new vinegar can be made by 
simply adding sweetened water. Always use soft water, but if it is not 
available, boil the water and set it in the sun a day or two. To make 
vinegar from apple or peach parings, fill a jar half full of parings, add 
one-half teacup molasses, and fill up with water. Set in the sun and 
strain for use in about two weeks. Tomato vinegar is made by mashing 
and straining a quart of ripe tomatoes, putting in a jar with one cupful 
of sugar or molasses, then filling the jar with soft water, and keeping in 
a sunny place two weeks. In default of other material vinegar may be 
made from yeast. Dissolve half a teacupful of brown sugar in one pint 
of warm water, add one small yeast cake, and fill the jar with water. 
This must be left to work for two weeks. 

Gooseberry Vinegar. — Boil one gallon of water; when cold add three 
quarts of ripe gooseberries, mashed. Allow it to stand for four days, 
stirring every day. On the fourth day strain through, a sieve to remove 
the seeds, then barrel. To erch gallon of the liquid add l^/i pound 
sugar, and one-eighth cake of compressed yeast. We used to use barm 
(the foam from fermenting beer) which was the ordinary form of yeast 
years ago in communities where home brewing was practiced. Stir every 
day until the vinegar has done fermenting, then close the barrel. Green 
or amber gooseberries are best. This is a very superior vinegar. 

Honey Vinegar. — One friend says she uses VA pound of strained 
honey to a gallon of water, but Bulletin 146 of the Otitario (Canada) 
Department of Agriculture advises l^A ounce of honey to one gallon of 
clear, soft water. Store in a barrel with an opening to permit air circu- 
lation, in a warm place; at the end of a year it is ready for use. The 
Ontario bulletin says its keeping qualities are excellent, and the best of 
pickles can be made with it, v/hile it is recommended for salads. 

Spiced Vinegar. — This gives a fine flavor to green vegetables, such as 
cucumbers, cabbage, cauliflower, beans, salads, etc. For each quart of 
vinegar slice a clove of garlic, a small onion, a two-inch root of horse- 
radish, half an ounce of bruised ginger root, a teaspoonful each of 
unground black pepper, allspice and mustard seed. Put all in a stone jar 
and simmer on the range for five hours. Then strain and bottle for use.

CATSUPS AND SAUCES. 

Barberry Catsup. — Stew three quarts of barberries with three cupfuls 
of water til) well cooked, then strain through a sieve. In a separate 
saucepan stew four quarts of cranberries, a cupful of raisins, a large 
quince sliced, four small onions minced and a quart of water for half an 
hour, then pass through a sieve; mix with the barberry juice and add 
half a cupful of vinegar, one- fourth of a cupful of salt, two cupfuls of 
brown sugar, a dessertspoonful each of ground cloves and ground all- 
spice, two tablespoonfuls each of black pepper and celery seed, one 
teaspoonful of cayenne, cinnamon and ginger and a grated nutmeg. Let 
the whole boil one minute. If too thick add vinegar or water. This recipe 
is given by Miss Parloa; some cooks make the catsup omitting the quince 
and cranberries. 

Bordeaux Sauce. — Two quarts of cabbage chopped to a powder, one 
quart of chopped green tomatoes, drained free of juice, three small onions 
chopped, one quart of vinegar, one-quarter ounce each of celery seed, 
black pepper, ginger and turmeric, one-eighth pound of mustard seed, 
one-quarter cupful of salt, and one-half pound of brown sugar; mix 
together, boil 15 minutes, and can while hot. 

Chili Sauce. — Peel and chop fine one onion, and six large tomatoes, 
add one green sweet Spanish pepper and one small hot chili pepper, 
chopped; then season with one cupful of vinegar, one tablespoonful salt, 
two teaspoonfuls brown sugar, one teaspoonful each of ground ginger, 
cinnamon, cloves and black pepper, and half a nutmeg. Boil slowly until 
very thoroughly cooked, then bottle and seal when cold. 

Chutney Sauce. — Eight ounces of tart apples, peeled and cored, eight 
ounces of peeled tomatoes, eight ounces brown sugar, eight ounces salt, 
four ounces powdered ginger, four ounces red peppers, two ounces 
shallots (or onion), two ounces garlic. Pound all together in a mortar 
(or pass through a chopper set to cut fine) and then put all the materials 
together in a jar with 2^ pints good vinegar. Place the jar in a warm 
place, covered for one month, stirring with a wooden spoon twice every 
day. At the end of the time pass the chutney through a sieve, and bottle, 
when it is ready for use. The intense heat of the peppers grows milder 
with keeping, and the chutney improves and becomes richer in flavor. 

Peach Chutney. — Pare and halve sufficient peaches' to weigh, when 
ready, three pounds. Put them in a large agate saucepan, add one pint 
of vinegar and stew gently until tender. Pound together in a mortar 
four ounces of white onions, two ounces garlic and five ounces of fresh 
ginger root; add these to the peaches with six ounces each of sugar, 
seeded raisins and white mustard seed. Add two ounces of dried chillies 
and one cupful of vinegar. Simmer for 10 minutes longer, then bottle. 
This is a familiar old English recipe.

Cranberry Catsup (Good Housekeeping). — One quart of cranberries, 
one cup of water and two cups of vinegar. Tie in a piece of muslin a 
few cloves, three or four allspice, about a dessertspoon of broken cinna- 
mon, and some mace. Simmer all together in a preserving kettle until 
the fruit is perfectly soft. Press through a colander, add one pound of 
brown sugar, simmer 10 minutes longer, and seal. This recipe will make 
a most delicious catsup, and one conveniently made in small quantities 
at any time throughout the Winter. 

Cucumber Catsup. — For a small quantity take 12 fine full-grown 
cucumbers and lay them an hour in cold water. Then pare them and 
grate them down in a deep dish. Grate also six small onions and mix 
them with the grated cucumber; season the mixture to your taste with 
pepper, salt and vinegar, making it of the consistency of jam. When 
thoroughly mixed put it in a glass jar, cover closely so that it will be 
perfectly air-tight. It will be found very nice to eat with beef or mutton, 
and if properly made and tightly covered it will keep well. It should be 
grated very fine, and the' vinegar must be real cider vinegar. 

Ripe Cucumber Catsup. — (Some people call this a "salad," but it is 
worth making under any name.) Peel 12 large, ripe cucum.bers ; remove 
seeds and pulp; chop the solid meat; mix with it a cupful of salt and 
hang in bag to drain. Chop 12 large onions and six peppers and mix 
with the cucumbers. Mix together one-fourth pound white mustard seed; 
one-half cupful celery seed, and one cupful of sugar. Mix all together; 
cover with cold vinegar; put in cans and fix tops firmly. The above, or 
any similar preparations should be kept in a dark, cool place. If the 
darkness is not available, wrap the cans with papers. 

Cooked Cucumber Catsup. — Choose large, nearly ripe cucumbers; pare, 
reject seeds, chop very fine and measure. Allow one teaspoonful of salt 
for every pint of pulp, sprinkle with same and drain through a colander 
for six hours. For every quart of cucumber allow two cups of cider 
vinegar, four teaspoonfuls of grated horseradish, one tablespoonful each 
of white mustard seed and minced red pepper (seeds rejected) ; bring 
vinegar and flavoring to a boil, skim thoroughly and set aside until 
perfectly cold. Then add the pulp to the vinegar, stir well, put into pint 
jars, lay a nasturtium or horseradish leaf over the top and seal. Keep 
in a dark, cool place. 

Currant Catsup.— To five pounds of currants allow three pounds of 
sugar, one tablespoon of cinnamon, one tablespoonful of cloves, one 
tablespoonful of allspice, one teaspoonful of black pepper, one teaspoonful 
of salt and half a pint of vinegar. Mash the currants and rub them 
through a sieve; then add the other ingredients and boil for twenty 
minutes. Bottle as you would tomato catsup. 



ISO " THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Gooseberry Catsup. — Five pounds of fruit, three pounds of sugar, V/2 
quart of vinegar, one tablespoonful of cloves, three tablespoonfuls of 
cinnamon, two tablespoonfuls of allspice. Wash the berries, put them in 
a porcelain stev^^pan, mash them well, add the other ingredients and boil 
until thick. Seal while hot. 

Grape Catsup. — Pick seven pounds of grapes off the stems, wash them, 
put them in a stone jar and set the jar over the fire in a deep pot of 
boiling water. Let the grapes cook in this manner for an hour in order 
to loosen the seeds. Remove from the fire and strain through a sieve, 
being careful that all the pulp goes through. Then add a pint of good 
cider vinegar, three and a half pounds of sugar and a teaspoonful each 
of cinnamon and cloves. Return to the fire and cook until thick. 

Mushroom Catsup. — The mushrooms should be freshly gathered; care- 
fully examined to see that they harbor no insects, and wiped, but not 
washed. Put a layer of mushrooms in the bottom of an earthen dish, 
and sprinkle well with salt; then another layer and more salt, continuing 
imtil all are used. Cover with a folded towel, and stand in a cool place 
for 24 hours; then mash and strain through a coarse bag. If put in a 
warm place the juice will ferment. To every quart of liquid add one 
ounce of pepper corns, and boil slowly in a porcelain-lined kettle for 30 
minutes; then add one-fourth ounce whole allspice, one-half ounce sliced 
ginger root, one dozen whole cloves and three blades of mace. Boil 15 
minutes longer, then take from the fire and stand aside to cool. When 
cool, strain through flannel, and put in small bottles, filling to the very 
top. Cork tightly, and dip cork in sealing wax. This is a delicious 
relish or seasoning, especially with poultry and mutton. 

Oude Sauce. — Four quarts of green tomatoes, 18 small peppers, 18 
small white onions; chop all together, add three cupfuls of salt and let 
stand ever night. In the morning drain ofif the water and add four

and most of the seeds ; put them in a kettle with three sliced onions, two- 
cloves of garlic, one teaspoonful of salt, one pint of vinegar and one table- 
spoonful of grated horseradish; boil together until the vegetables can be 
rubbed through a coarse sieve; return to the fire, add a pint of vinegar,, 
one tablespoonful of brown sugar, one teaspoonful each of ground cloves, 
allspice and black pepper; boil five minutes; bottle and seal while ftot. 
Plum Catsup. — Wash and drain four quarts of damson plums; c(«.ver 
with a quart of water and cook slowly until tender, then press througUp a 
sieve, rubbing through as much pulp and skin as you ran; return to th« 
kettle; add three-quarters of a pound of sugar, t\v?8j: leve.1 tea&:^oonluI»

of cinnamon, a half teaspoonful of allspice and one of ground cloves; 
simmer gently until as thick as tomato catsup ; then bottle and cork. 

Peach Catsup. — Pare and quarter one peck of firm, ripe peaches; add 
one pint of water to the peelings and one dozen sliced kernels; simmer 
30 minutes, then strain ; add peaches to the liquor and simmer another 
30 minutes; add one cupful cf vinegar, one-half cupful each of lemon 
juice and sugar, two teaspoonfuls of ground cinnamon, and one-half

until as thick as desired. Seal hot in pint jars. 

Red Pepper Catsup. — Two dozen pods of red pepper; put in a preserve 
kettle with a half pint of strong vinegar and a pint of water; set on the 
stove and let come to a boil. Add one root of grated horseradish, three 
sliced onions, six whole cloves and one-half ounce of white mustard seed. 
Let boil 10 minutes longer and strain. Put back in the kettle with a half 
leacupful of brown sugar, one ounce of celery seed and a pint of strong 
vinegar. Boil one hour, then bottle. This catsup will keep any length 
of time. 

Shirley Sauce. — Chop very fine twenty- four large tomatoes, two large 
onions, two peppers; add one tablespoonful of salt, two of sugar, one 
teaspoonful each of ginger, cloves, allspice, cinnamon, one nutmeg, one 
pint of vinegar. Stew one hour and bottle while hot. 

Southern Mixed Catsup. — Peel and cut up enough crisp, green cucum- 
bers to fill a half-gallon measure, sprinkle with salt and let stand six 
hours, press the water from them and scald in weak vinegar. Prepare 
half a gallon of cabbage in the same way. Chop one dozen small onions, 
cover with boiling water and let stand half an hour. Cut in slices one 
quart of green tomatoes, one pint of green beans, one dozen small ears 
of tender corn and one dozen green peppers. Scald and drain them.

cayenne, two of olive oil and one pound of sugar. Put in a jar with 
the prepared vegetables and cover with boiling vinegar. 

Tomato Catsup. — Pare one-half bushel tomatoes and cook until very 
soft, sift them, taking all the seeds out. Then cook until as thick as you 
desire the catsup and then add one quart vinegar, one-half pint salt, and 
the following spices: One tablespoonful each of cloves, ginger and cinna- 
mon, two tablespoonfuls each of mustard, black pepper and allspice, and 
one-half teaspoonful cayenne pepper. Let it cook 10 minutes, then bottle 
and cork tight, no further sealing is needed as it will keep for years 
simply corked. 

Tomato Catsup No. 2. — Wash and cut in pieces a half peck of ripe 
tomatoes. Cook in a porcelain-lined or granite iron preserving kettle till

soft enough to put through a sieve, which will remove skins and seeds. 
To the pulp add two tablespoonfuls of salt, two tablespoonfuls pepper, 
one-half tablespoon allspice, one-half tablespoon cloves and one-half pint 
vinegar. Let the tomato cook for several hours before adding the spices 
and vinegar. Mix the salt and spices dry in a bowl, and blend well before 
putting into the tomato. Cook till quite thick and put in bottles. Store 
in a cool cellar. 

Uncooked Tomato Catsup. — Peel and chop a peck of ripe tomatoes and 
hang in bag, to drain for 24 hours. Add to the drained tomato four 
bunches of celery (chopped fine) and one large cupful of chopped onion. 
Mix the three vegetables thoroughly and then add one-fourth cup of salt; 
one- fourth cup sugar; two tablespoonfuls mustard seed; two tablespoon- 
fuls ground cinnamon ; one teaspoonful ground allspice, and two large red 
peppers, chopped fine. Alix very thoroughly; cover with good cider 
vinegar, and put in self-sealing cans. 

Uncooked Catsup No. 2. — One peck of ripe tomatoes ; two horseradish 
roots ; two large onions ; four stalks of celery ; two ounces mustard seed ; 
four green peppers; one scant cup of salt; one cup of sugar; three pints 
of vinegar. Pare and quarter tomatoes, place in colander to drain; chop 
fine the celery, onions and peppers; grate the horseradish. Mix all thor- 
oughly. Put in cans and seal. 

Green Tomato Catsup. — One peck of green tomatoes and two large 
onions sliced. Place them in layers, sprinkling salt between ; let them 
stand 24 hours and then wash and drain them. Add a quarter of a pound 
of mustard seed, one ounce allspice, one ounce cloves, one ounce ground 
mustard, one ounce ground ginger, two tablespoonfuls black pepper, two 
teaspoonfuls celery seed, a quarter of a pound of brown sugar. Put all 
in preserving pan, cover with vinegar and boil two hours ; then strain 
through a sieve and bottle for use. 

Tomato Chutney. — Two pounds ripe tomatoes, two pounds sugar, one- 
half pound green ginger, one pound raisins stoned, one-fourth pound of 
salt, one ounce garlic, one-haif ounce powdered chillies, one quart vinegar. 
Place the tomatoes in a shallow pan and put in an oven till they crack, 
when the skins can be readily removed. Peel and core and boil them 
with one-half of the vinegar 10 minutes. Pound or grind the ginger, 
garlic and raisins with enough vinegar to make them into a paste. Boil 
the sugar with the remainder of the vinegar into a thick syrup. Mix ail 
the ingredients together with the salt and chillies, and boil till the fruit and 
syrup run the one way when put on a plate held sideways. Bottle and seal. 



CHAPTER XIII. 

SALADS. 

Beet Dressing. — One cupful vinegar, one-half cupful sugar, butter the 
size of a walnut, salt and pepper to taste, scant tablespoon of cornstarch 
or flour. Mix thoroughl}'-, boil till it thickens, pour over the sliced boiled 
beets and serve immediately. 

Butter Dressing for Potato Salad. — One cupful butter, melted, into 
which is stirred one tablespoonful of flour, half cupful of vinegar, one 
teaspoonful salt, one egg, half teaspoonful mustard, and a little pepper. 
Add a small cupful of boiling water, and cook together until thickened 
like cream. 

Dressing With Bacon Fat. — Cook two tablespoonfuls of flour and a 
dash of paprika or red pepper in five tablespoonfuls of hot bacon fat. 
Add four or five tablespoonfuls of vinegar and half a cupful of water. 
Stir and cook until boiling. Then gradually pour over the beaten yolk 
of an egg (preferably two yolks). Return to the fire (over hot water) to 
cook the egg, and add salt if needed. Use when cold. This dressing is 
particularly good with endive or lettuce, alone or with eggs. 

French Dressing. — This consists of three tablespoonfuls of oil to one 
tablespoonful of vinegar. For every tablespoonful of vinegar and three 
of oil, take one-half teaspoonful of salt and one-fourth teaspoonful of 
black or white pepper. I\Iix the salt and pepper with the oil and add the 
vinegar gradually, stirring thoroughly until it becomes white and a little 
thickened. This dressing must be used as soon as it is made or it will 
separate. 

Prepared Dressing. — Here is a delicious salad dressing, which will keep 
a long time if put on ice, or in a cold place. Mix half a cupful of oil, 
five tablespoonfuls vinegar, half a teaspoonful powdered sugar, half a 
small Bermuda onion, finely chopped, two tablespoonfuls chopped parsley, 
half a tablespoonful chopped red pepper, one tablespoonful chopped greea 
pepper, one teaspoonful salt. Let it stand for an hour, then whip up 
with an tgg beater before using. 

Sour Cream Dressing. — Chill a cupful of rich sour cream until very 
cold, then beat well for five minutes, adding, while beating, a tablespoon- 
ful of powdered sugar and a half teaspoonful of lemon juice. Slice 
chilled cucumbers very thin, and serve with this dressing. 

Salad Dressing Without Oil. — Piece of butter the size of an egg. 
Heat in granite basin, add sifted flour till thick. Then add one cupful 
of milk. When smooth add one cupful vinegar; two eggs (beaten); salt, 



184 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

pepper, red or black, mnstard, seasoned as you wish ; one tablespoon of 
sugar. Cook till thick. The jiditicn of a half cupful of well-beaten sour 
or sweet cream will be found excellent. This dressing on potatoes, cu- 
cumbers, lettuce or beets makes a most palatable salad. The friend who 
gave this says it is a dressing that will keep for some time. She always 
keeps a jar of it on hand. The left-over dish of beets, peas or string 
beans is put in the potato salad for supper. 

Mayonnaise. — Put tlie uncocked yolks of two eggs into an earthen 
bowl, beat them well with a silver or wooden fork for about one minute; 
then add a half teaspoonful of salt, a dash of cayenne, and if you desire, 
a half-teaspoonful of mustard. Work these well together, and then add 
drop by drop, a half pint or more of olive oil. Stir rapidly and steadily 
v;hile adding the oil ; do not reverse the motion, or the mayonnaise may 
curdle. After stirring in the first gill of oil, alternate occasionally with 
a few drops of lemon juice or vinegar. The more oil you use. the thicker 
the dressing. If too thick, add vinegar enough to make it the proper 
consistency. The mayonnaise should be kept as cool as possible during 
the making. 

Banana Salad. — The bananas are peeled, sliced lengthwise down the 
middle, dipped in mayonnaise, and laid, fiat side up, on lettuce leaves. 
A layer of finely chopped peanuts is put on the banana, and a spoonful of 
mayonnaise dressing put by it. Serve with heated graham crackers. This 
is delicious. 

Beet Salad. — Slice and cut into dice enough cold boiled beets to make 
a pint; heap in the center of a salad dish, and cover with sauce Tartare. 
This is made by adding a few chopped olives, gherkins and capers to 
mayonnaise dressing. If the mayonnaise is not desired, any ordinary salad 
mixture may be used, and the salad garnished with hard-boiled eggs and 
parsley. 

Cream Slaw. — Cut a small half head of white, tender cabbage on a 
slaw cutter (or fine, with a sharp knife) ; sprinkle a very little black 
pepper over it, and add one-third of small teaspoonful of salt. Have 
ready a small half pint of thick sweet cream; add to this three even 
tablespoonfuls of granulated sugar; stir until dissolved, then whip this 
to a stiff froth, adding gradually two and a half tablespoonfuls of good 
vinegar. When finished pour over the cabbage, stirring it lightly until 
all is covered and stand in refrigerator, or in cold water, for 10 or 1.5 
minutes before serving. The slaw should not be made too long before 
serving, as the cold, crisp taste is most appetizing. 

Herring Salad. — Heat through by broiling, or in the oven, three smoked 
herrings. Then tear off the heads and pull the skin away; split, take out 
the backbones, and cut up into small bits, or to shred them is better. 
Put in a salad bowl, add one small chopped onion, two hard-boiled eggs, 
chopped, and one boiled potato ; cut fine with a teaspoonful of chopped 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 185 

parsley ; season with a teaspoonful of salt, one of pepper, three table- 
spoonfuls of vinegar and two of oil; mix well, and if you have it, deco- 
rate with a boiled beet. 

Hot Slaw. — Cut a head -of cabbage fine. Have ready enough dressing, 
half vinegar and half water, and one-fourth sugar, with a lump of butter 
to cover it. Simmer until done. It is good cold. It is well to salt the 
dressing a little, to taste. 

Potato Salad. — Slice cold boiled potatoes with one raw onion to sea- 
son. For the salad dressing, put on stove a saucepan with one pint of 
vinegar and butter the size of an Qgg,. Beat two or three eggs with two 
tablespoonfuls of mustard and a small teaspoonful of salt, and one of 
black pepper, two tablespoonfuls of sugar. When thoroughly beaten pour 
slowly into the vinegar until it thickens. Be careful not to cook too 
long, or the egg will curdle. Remove and when cold pour over the salad. 
It improves this to add the yolks of two or three hard boiled eggs mashed 
luie and beaten in with the mustard, or add a cupful of cream. This will 
keep several days in a cool pbce if desired. Plain French dressing may 
be used instead if desired. 

German Potato Salad. — Boil a few extra potatoes at dinner time. 
When cold, carefully slice very thin. Set away to chill. When supper 
time comes, cut for a quart of sliced potatoes one good-sized onion into 
thin slices. Add a dash of pepper. Take two big 'slices of bacon, very 
fat, cut into cubes, fry, add one-half cupful of vinegar. Pour over the 
ialad and toss lightly with two forks. 

Waldorf Salad. — Handsome red apples are selected, polished, but not 
peeled, cored, and then hollowed into cups. The pieces removed are 
mixed with chopped celery, put in the apple cups, a spoonful of mayon- 
naise dressing being put over the top. The apples are put on individual 
plates, each fruit standing on a crinkly lettuce leaf. 



CHAPTER XIV. 

CHEESE. 

Cottage Cheese. — Bulletin No. 245, issued by the New York Experi- 
ment Station at Geneva, is devoted to this subject; it will be found help- 
ful by anyone making this cheese, either for market or domestic use. In 
describing the manufacture of this cheese, the bulletin says that good 
cottage cheese should have a soft, smooth texture, being neither mushy 
nor dry and sawdust like. The flavor should be that of mildly soured 
milk or well ripened cream, with an entire absence of bitter taste, flavor 
of stable, or other objectionable qualities. Such flavor may usually be 
secured by the use of a good starter; but if too much whey is retained 
the cheese may be sour. Flavor and texture are quite closely connected, 
at this point, for a slow draining curd is liable to result in poor textured 
and poor flavored cheese. The various steps in making cottage cheese 
may be summarized as follows. 

Use skim-milk rather than whole milk, to avoid loss of fat. To se- 
cure proper flavor and speedy souring add a small amount of a good 
starter. This starter should be prepared from clean, fresh milk, sep- 
arated from the cream and placed in a carefully cleaned receptacle, well 
covered and brought to a temperature of 90 degrees, and then allowed to 
stand from 20 to 24 hours at a temperature of 65 to 78 degrees. The 
upper portion of this should be discarded and the amount needed strained 
through a fine strainer or hair sieve and thoroughly mixed with the milk 
from which cheese is to be made the next day. A portion may also be 
used in preparing a starter for the next day, but as soon as any unfav- 
orable effect is noticed a new stafter should be prepared. Several good 
and convenient commercial starters are on the market, for use of which 
directions accompany each package. 

The milk is now kept at a temperature of 70 to 75 degrees until well 
curdled, often in 24 hours, sometimes not until 48 hours. The curdled 
mass is broken up by hand or by a curd knife, raised gradually to 90 de- 
grees, taking 30 to 40 minutes in the process. The whey should then 
separate clear in 15 to 20 minutes, after which it is run from the curd, 
and the latter placed in muslin bags or on racks to drain. When whey 
ceases to come from the curd, salt is added to taste or at the rate of 
about a pound for 100 pounds of cheese, the curd formed into balls and 
wrapped in oiled paper that may be obtained from any dairy supply 
house. For the finest quality of cheese, thick cream, preferably ripened 
cream, should be added at the rate of about an ounce for one pound 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 187 

of cheese, before the cheese is made into balls. If it is thought best to 
hasten the curdling rennet extract may be added about eight hours after 
the starter has been introduced, using one ounce of rennet extract for 
1,000 pounds of milk. 

Escalloped Cheese. — Into a buttered baking dish sprinkle a layer of 
coarse bread crumbs, with butter, pepper and salt on top. Next add a 
layer of cheese, alternating with bread and cheese until the dish is full. 
Have bread crumbs on top, pour on sweet milk until you can see it by 
tilting the dish a little, and bake until done. 

Cheese Fondu. — Put one tablespoonful of butter in pan, then one cup 
milk; let it boil, then add one cup bread crumbs and two cups grated 
cheese, little pepper and dry mustard. When the cheese melts add two 
well-beaten eggs. 

Macaroni with Cheese. — Throw one-half box of macaroni into boiling 
water and cook 20 minutes. Never let the water stop boiling, or the 
macaroni will be soft. Drain and pour into a buttered baking dish. Have 
ready one cup of cheese cut into small pieces and stir this through the 
hot macaroni together with salt and pepper to taste and a lump of butter 
the size of a small ^gg. Add enough sweet milk almost to cover and 
sprinkle the top with more grated cheese. Bake three-quarters of an 
hour in a moderate oven. A good supper dish on a cold night. 

Cheese Patties. — When making pies line a number of patty pans with 
thin paste and bake. These will keep several days, but are better fresh. 
Grate one-fourth pound cheese and add one pint milk, one tablespoon 
flour, one-half teaspoon mustard or one dessertspoon prepared m.ustard, 
one tablespoon butter and salt and pepper to taste. Carefully heat to- 
gether, stirring to make a smooth mass. Serve hot in the patty shells. 

Cheese Puffs. — Make some puff paste; roll it out and cut it into squares 
of about three inches. Beat the yolks of two eggs and a little made mus- 
tard, a dash of cayenne pepper and two tablespoonfuls of grated cheese, 
to form a thick paste. Place a spoonful of the mixture in each square 
of pastry, pull the four points to the center, pinching them together to 
make them stand up. Bake 10 minutes and serve very hot. 

Cheese Pudding. — Lay thin slices of stale bread, lightly buttered, in a 
baking dish, and cover with broken cheese, no matter how old and dry 
it is. Season with red pepper and salt. Fill the dish with alternate 
layers of bread and cheese. Beat two eggs in a pint of milk, pour over 
the bread and cheese, and bake in a hot oven. This will serve six per- 
sons. 

Spanish Rabbit. — To a cupful of grated cheese add two-thirds the 
quantity of minced onion, which is first cooked in boiling water. Drain 
and add milk almost to cover the onions ; season with salt and pepper 
and when the milk is hot put in the cheese. As soon as the cheese is 
melted stir in one well-beaten &gg. Cook a moment longer and serve.

Cheese Ramekins. — Two ounces of bread crumbs boiled in one gill 
of milk; to this add four tablespoonfuls of grated cheese, two of melted 
butter, and stir over the fire until blended. Take off and add the beaten 
yolks of two eggs, salt and pepper to taste. Beat the whites of three 
eggs stiff, stir carefully into the mixture, and bake 15 minutes in a quick 
oven. 

Cheese Souffle. — Put two tablespoonfuls of butter in a saucepan; when 
it melts add one heaping tablespoonful of flour, stir until smooth ; add a 
half-cup of milk, a saltspoonful of salt and a saltspoonful of paprika; 
cook two minutes; add the well-beaten yolks of three eggs and one cup 
of grated cheese, but take it off the fire just before adding them, and 
when you stir them all in well set it away to cool. When cold add the 
stifily beaten vi^hites of the eggs, turn into a buttered dish and place im- 
mediately in the oven and bake ^5 or 30 minutes. Have a folded napkin 
ready to wrap around the dish and serve it immediately, or it will fall. 

Cheese Sticks. — Mix together one pint grated cheese, one pint flour, 
one tablespoon butter, two scant teaspoons baking po\yder, a little salt 
and a dash of pepper. Mix with milk or water and roll thin like piQ 
crust. Cut into strips four or five inches long and nearly an inch wide. 
Bake in a quick oven. 

Cheese Straws. — One cupful of grated cheese and one tablespoonful of 
butler creamed together; two slices of bread, without crust, dried in oven 
and rolled fine. Four tablespoonfuls of cold water, pinch of salt, dust 
of red pepper, and flour enough to roll out. Cut in strips and bake a 
delicate brown. 

Cheese Toast. — Grate a cupful of cheese, and lightly mix in a heaping 
saltspoonful of mustard, a half-saltspoonful of salt and a speck of cay- 
enne. Heap this on thin strips or triangles of buttered toast, place them 
in a hot oven for a few moments, and serve as soon as the cheese begins 
to melt. Any kind of a thin cracker may be used instead, and a dusting 
of paprika over each piece in place of the cayenne. 

Welsh Custards. — One cupful of dry grated cheese, four eggs, one cup- 
ful of milk, one teaspoon ful of butter, two of flour, mixed with milk, a 
bit of soda size of pea, half a teaspoonful of salt and a pinch of cayenne. 
Heat the milk, stirring in the soda, butter, salt and pepper, and the flour 
mixture, and pour scalding hot on the eggs beaten light in a bowl. Add 
the cheese, beat up for a minute, pour into buttered custard cups and 
bake in a brisk oven for 20 minutes. Thev should be served instantlv.

AVARM SUPPER AND BREAKFAST DISHES. 

Anchovy Toast. — Tcast a small round of bread for each person, butter 
and put in vegetable dish. Make a sauce of one pint of milk and two 
tablespoonfuls of flour; when thickened add level saltspoonful of salt, 
dash of cayenne and three teaspoonfuls of anchovy essence or five 
anchovies boned and pounded. Pour over the toast; serve hot. 

Arrowroot Cream Toast.- —First put into a double boiler a scant pint 
of rich milk and a teacupful o*f cream; let it come to the boiling point, 
then add a large tablespoonful of fresh butter and a tablespoonful of 
arrowroot wetted in a little milk or cream ; season to taste with salt, and 
let it boil up. Toast light slices of bread, browning evenly. Put two 
slices at a time into the sauce, and as soon as they soften all through, 
which will only take a short time, put in a covered dish kept hot. Pour 
a little sauce over each layer, and serve the toast while very hot. 

Golden Cream Toast. — Cut slices of stale bread into diamonds and 
toast to a pale brown, drying slightly in the oven before browning. Make 
a rich white sauce of a pint of milk, three tablespoonfuls of butter, two 
tablespoonfuls of flour, half a teaspoonful of salt, a dusting of mace and 
a light dusting of pepper. Cook until smooth, add the grated yolks 
of three hard-boiled eggs and pour over the toasted bread. 

Baked Toast. — Prepare toast in the ordinary way, and, as each slice 
is ready, dip quickly into a pan of boiling water slightly salted, then 
pack into a baking dish, sprinkle well with salt, and cover deep with 
boiling milk. Bake in a dish, closely covered, for 15 minutes, and serve. 
The toast should have absorbed all the liquid without getting dry. If 
you can spare three or four tablespoonfuls of cream, heat, and pour over 
the surface just before sending to the table. The baking lends smooth- 
ness and richness to this dish not to be found in milk toast prepared in 
the usual way. 

Bread Croquettes. — Rub the inside of a loaf of stale bread through 
a colander, then measure. To one good quart add one pint of milk and 
heat over the fire in a double boiler. As soon as it reaches the scalding 
point take it off, let stand for a moment, then add one-half of a cupful 
of cleaned currants, two tablespoonfuls of chopped citron, one-half of a 
teaspoonful of cinnamon, two tablespoonfuls of chopped almonds and 
the beaten yolks of two raw eggs. Return to the fire and stir and cook 
for two minutes, then turn out on a greased dish and set aside until cold. 
Form carefully into small cylinders, dip each in egg, roll in fine dried 
crumbs and fry golden brown in hot fat. Serve with a foamy sauce. 



190 THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

Cheese Pie. — Cut bread into one-third inch slices, cutting each slice in 
half. Butter a shallow baking dish, put in a layer of bread, then a layer 
of soft mild cheese, cut in one-eighth inch slices, and sprinkled with salt 
and paprika or pepper. Beat two eggs slightly and add one cup of milk. 
Pour over the bread and bake until the cheese is soft, which will take 
about 30 minutes. 

Hulled Corn au Gratin. — For one quart of hulled corn prepare a pint 
of rich cream sauce, flavoring it with Worcestershire sauce or other 
condiments to make it piquant. Put the sauce and corn in a baking dish 
or individual ramekins in alternate layers, sprinkle the top with grated 
cheese and a dusting of paprika, and bake until well browned on top. 

Noodles. — Beat an ^gg slightly, but not until it foams; salt it to 
season the dough, and then work in all the flour the egg can be made 
to take up. Take the dough on to the board and knead in flour until it 
is stiff and smooth, then roll out as thin as possible. Let the sheet of 
dough dry for a while, but roll it into a roll like a jelly roll before it 
gets dry enough to break when rolled; slice from the end, and shake into 
strings. The thinner the dough is rolled, and the finer it is cut the better 
the noodles are. A very thin, sharp knife makes the work of cutting 
much easier and insures much fi.ner noodles. The directions given call 
for one tgg as a basis, but the method of making is exactly the same if 
six, or a dozen eggs are used. Three medium-sized eggs will make a 
sheet of dough 20 inches square if properly rolled out, and will be 
enough for a family of six or eight hungry people. When dry enough 
to roll and cut, the noodles arc dry enough to cook, but they may be kept 
for hours or days, after they are cut. 

Cheese Noodles. — Make your noodles the day before you want to use 
them and shave fine. Drop lightly into boiling water and allow them to 
cook 15 minutes over a hot fire. Do not let them simmer, or they will 
turn out a mushy mass. Drain and fill a rather deep pan to the depth 
of two inches. Season with salt and pepper and pour over them enough 
sweet milk almost to cover. Over the top grate cheese to the depth of 
half an inch, cover and bake one hour, removing cover the last 15 min- 
utes unless oven is too hot. 

Rice Croquettes. — To one tcacupful of boiled rice, add one teaspoonful 
of butter, a beaten tgg, a seasoning of salt and pepper,- and mix well to- 
gether. Mold into rolls, or small cakes, dip into tgg, and then into pow- 
dered cracker crumbs and fry in hot butter or drippings. A little finely 
chopped cold meat is an improvement; it should be mixed with the rice 
and egg before molding. 

Rice Muffins. — One pint of milk, one pint boiled rice, two eggs, two table- 
spoonfuls of sugar, one tablespoonful of butter, one teaspoonful each of 
salt and baking powder. Beat the sugar, salt, yolks of eggs and butter 



THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 191 

together, add the milk and sufficient flour to make a thin batter; sift the 
rice in lightly, and last the beaten whites. Bake in rings 30 minutes. 

Royal Toast. — Put bread toasted a delicate brown in a square shallow 
pan; put a piece of butter the size of a walnut on each slice, and sprinkle 
with sugar. Arrange in layers, and pour over the whole enough milk 
or cream to half fill the pan. Cover closely and set in a slow oven until 
the liquid is all absorbed. 

Swiss Toast. — Mash one-half box of berries, but not too fine; sweeten 
one-quarter cup of sugar, then cut five slices of stale bread as for toast- 
ing. Cover each slice with the berries. Retain some of the juice so as 
not to make the bread too soft. Heat about two tablespoonfuls of but- 
ter in a large frying pan ; put the slices with the berries on them carefully 
into the hot butter and fry slowly until the bread is browned on the un- 
derside, basting the berries with the butter while in the pan. Transfer the 
bread and berries to a hot platter; pour the rest of the juice over them 
and serve immediately. 

Tomato Toast. — This can often be made from stewed or scalloped to- 
matoes left over from dinner; the extra juice from canned tomatoes 
which often makes them seem too watery, is useful for the toast. The 
tomato is simmered with the proper flavoring, strained through a sieve, 
and then thickened with flour and butter before being poured over the 
toast. If one wishes to make more of a dish, crisp fried bacon may be 
served with it, or a spoonful of minced ham or other cooked meat may 
be put on the top of each piece of toast before the tomato is poured 
over it. 

Creamed Tomatoes. — Peel several tomatoes and cut them in moderately 
thick slices. Fry them in butter, seasoning them as they are frying with 
pepper and salt. Remove them carefully to a platter, leaving the shreds 
of the tomatoes that have fallen ofif. Pour into the pan about three- 
quarters of a cup of rich milk and thicken with flour. Pour this sauce 
over the tomatoes. 

Blueberry Pancakes. — Sift one scant pint of flour with one teaspoonful 
of baking powder and a half-teaspoonful of salt. Mix two well-beaten 
eggs with 2J/^ cupfuls of sweet milk and thoroughly blend all together. 
Grease the griddle, drop the batter on in large spoonfuls and spread a 
teaspoonful of blueberries on each, pressing into the cake. Turn, and 
when brown serve with butter and powdered sugar. 

Buckwheat Cakes. — One pint milk scalded and cooled, one-half tea- 
spoonful salt. When lukewarm add one-fourth of a yeast cake which has 
been dissolved in a little warm water ; one cup buckwheat flour and one 
cup white flour. Let rise over night. In the morning stir in one-fourth 
teaspoonful of soda and one tablespoonful molasses. Beat vigorously 
before cooking. 

Mixed Buckwheat Cakes. — Sift together two cupfuls of buckwheat, 



192 • THE RURAL COOK BOOK. 

one cupful of rolled oats, one cupful of cornmeal, one scant teaspoonful 
of salt. Mix to a pour batter, with equal parts of milk and water, add 
one-third of a cake of compressed yeast, cover and stand in a warm 
place over night; before baking add one-third of a teaspoonful of soda 
dissolved in hot water. These are good and easy of digestion. 

Crumb Croquettes. — Melt a tablespoonful of butter in a frying pan 
and add a tablespoonful of flour; a cupful of sweet milk, and salt and 
pepper to season. Cook until it thickens, then add one beaten t^g. Re- 
move from the fire and mix in bread crumbs until the mixture is thick. 
Make into balls and let get cold. Roll in egg and crumbs ; fry in deep 
fat like other croquettes. 

Crumb Pancakes. — Two cupiuls sour milk, one-half teaspoonful soda, 
two cupfuls stale bread crumbs, two eggs, two cupfuls flour, two level 
teaspoonfuls baking powder, pinch of salt. Soak bread crumbs in the 
milk over night, add dissolved soda ; if one has stale Johnny cake a 
change may be made by using one cupful bread crumbs and one cupful 
Johnny cake crumbs. In the morning add the eggs, well beaten, then sift 
in the flour and baking powder. It may be that two cupfuls of flour 
will not be needed to make a suitable batter; use just enough. 

French Pancakes. — Beat five eggs very light, add two tablespoonfuls 
of melted butter, one and one-half pints of milk, and enough wheat 
tlour, sifted with two teaspoonfuls of baking powder, to make a good 
batter. About a quart of flour will be needed. Melt a little butter in a 
large frying pan, and pour the batter into this. When brown on one 
side, turn carefully and brown on the other. When done, spread quickly 
with fruit jelly, and roll up as you would a sheet of music. Transfer 
carefully to a very hot dish, sprinkle with powdered sugar, or with pow- 
dered sugar and ground cinnamon, and serve immediately. 

Flannel Cakes. — One cupful of Indian meal, two cupfuls of flour, three 
of boiling milk, one-fourth of a yeast cake, one teaspoonful of salt, two 
tablespoonfuls of butter and one of sugar. Pour the boiling milk upon 
the meal and butter; let it cool; then add the flour, salt, sugar and the 
portion of yeast dissolved in four tablespoonfuls of cold water. Let it 
rise over night, and in the morning fry as you would griddle cakes. 

Yeast Flannel Cakes. — Heat q half-pint of sweet milk and into it put 
one heaping tablespoonful butter, let it melt, add a half pint cold milk 
and the well beaten yoXVis of two eggs, a half teaspoonful of salt, two 
tablespoonfuls homemade yeast, and flour to make a stiff batter. Let 
rise in a warm place over night. Before baking add the beaten whites, 
which have been kept in a cool place during the night. Be sure to make 
batter stiff enough, as flour must not be added after it has risen. These 
cakes, half cornmeal and half wheat, are- very nice.
