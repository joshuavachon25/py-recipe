Use as little water as will dissolve the sugar. Do 
not stir sugar or chocolate candy. If possible use an 
iron or brass kettle and apply heat at bottom, not at 
sides. Use for greasing, washed butter or pure sweet 
lard, if you prefer. By " boil till brittle" is meant boil • 
ing the candy until it will crack when tested in cold 
water; add soda or saleratus iust before taking from 
fire. Mark candies when nearly cold with a buttered 
case knife.

Here are directions for dealing with a poisonous bite 
of any kind on the hand or foot, or limb near either. 
Put a ligature above it to prevent a return flow of 
blood, then scrape the wound or otherwise keep it 
open so that the blood will flow freely. This prevents 
the veins from carrying the poison into the system and 
at the same time the free flow of blood tends to wash 
the poison out ; it is a general rule that the more 
freely a wound bleeds the less danger there is of poison 
being absorbed.

Cucumber Pickles. 

The old style of laying cucumbers down in brine, 
then, when wanted for use, soaking them out in a 
brass kettle, to make them green, is tedious, and, I 
think, rather dangerous. Now, I have good, nice, 
solid pickles that were put down last summer, and the 
following is my method of preparing them : I pick 
from the vines, wash carefully, and when dry put 
them in good cider vinegar; tie a paper over the top 
of the jar; some seal them, but I have not. I like 
this way very much.

coarse towel, put them into a preserving kettle, as 
many as it will hold, and to every pint of sharp cider 
vinegar add one pound sugar, one ounce of stick cin- 
namon and half teaspoonful cloves (always have 
enough of the vinegar, sugar and spices to cover the 
fruit), put all into a kettle and let it come to a boil, 
then take out the peaches carefully and boil the 
sugar, vinegar and spices fifteen or twenty minutes
