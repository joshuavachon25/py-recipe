FISH. 

FISH. 



19 



Fish when fresh are hard when pressed by the finger— the gills 
red— the eyes full. If the flesh is flabby and the eyes sunken, 
I the fish are stale. They should be thoroughly cleaned, washed, 
and sprinkled with salt. 

Before broiling fish, rub the gridiron with a piece of fat, to 
prevent its sticking. Lay tlie skin side down first. 

The earthy taste oftei: found in fresh-water fish can be re- 
moved by soaking in salt and water. 

Most kinds of salt fish should be soaked in cold water for 
twenty-four hours— the fleshy side turned down in the water.

meat balls around the disli and strain the gravy on to the pigeons. 

TO ROAST AVILD FOWL. 

The llavor is best preserved without stuhing. I'ut pep))er, salt 
and a piece of butter into each. Wild fowl reiiuire much less dress- 
ing than tame. They should be served of a line color and a rich 
brown gravy. To take olf the hshy ta^jte which wild fowl some- 
times have, put an onion, salt and hot water into the dri])ping-iian, 
and baste them for the tirst ten minutes with this, then take away 
the pan and baste constantly with butter. 

TO POAST PAKTBIDGLS, PHEASANTS OR QUAILS. 
Pluck, singe, <lraw and truss them, season with salt and i)epi»er, 
roast for about half an hour in a brisk oven, basting often with 
butter. When done place on a dish together with bread crumbs 
fried brown and arranged in small heaps. Gravy should be served 
in a tureen apart. 

TO BROIL ()CAIL OR AVOODCOCK. 
After dressing split down the ])ack, sjtriukle with salt and i>ep. 
])er, and lay them on a gridiron, the inside down. Broil slowly at 
first. Serve with cream gravy. 

TO ROAST WILD DUCK OR TEAL. 
After dressing, soak them over night in salt and water, to draw 
out the lishy taste. Then in the morning [ait them into fresh 
water, changing several times before roSstiug. Stuff or not, aa 
desired. Serve with current jelly.

POULTRY. 



HOW To CHOOSE POlLTrvV. 

\'oung, pluni]!, and well fed, but not too fat poultry are the 
best. Tlie skin .should be fine grained, clear, and white ; the 
bn.'ast full, lleslied, and l)road ; the legs smooth. The birds nuist 
!)(• hea\7' in proportion to their size. As regards ducks and geese,r 
their breasts must also be plump ; the feet tle.vible and yellow. 
For boiling, whitedegged jioultry must be chosen, because when 
dressed their a]i])erance is by far the more delicate. But darker- 
legged ones are Juicy and of a better llavor when roasted. The 
greatest jirecaution ought to be taken to prevent porltry from 
getting at all tainted before it is cooked. It should be killed and 
dressed fmm eiglit to ten hours before cooking. Pigeons are far 
better for Vicing cooked the iluy they are kiUed, as th(!y lose tludr 
davor by hanging. Care must be taken to cook poultry thoroughly, 
fornothing is more revolting to tlie palate than underdone poultry _ 

M'LAIN STUFFING. 

'J'ake stale bread, cut off all the crust, rul) very fine and pouv 
over it as much melted butter as will make it crumble in Jyour 
hands ; salt and pepper to taste. 

POTATO STUFFING. 

Take two-thirds bread and one-third boiled 



potatoes 
a little 



grated, 
itround 



butter size of an egg, pepper, salt, one egg, and 
sage : mix thoroughly. 

APPLE STUFFING. 
Take half a i)Ound of the pr.lp of tart apples which have been 
linked or scalded ; add two ounces of bread-crumbs, some powdered 
.sage, a liiiely shred onion ; season well with cayenne pepper. F'or 
roast goose, duck, etc. 

CHESTNUT STUFFING. 

Roil the chestnuts and shell them, then blanch them aad boil 
until soft ; mash them line and mix: with a little sweet cream, some 
bread-crumbs, pepiier and salt. For turkey.

ter, pepper, salt, three tablcspoonfuls rich cream ; stir well and 
l)ake in a buttered dish until bvown. Eat hut. 

BEETS. 

Wash thoroughly, being careful not to prick the skin, as that 
will destroy the color ; put into boiling water and boil live or 
six hours ; if served hot season with butter, pepper, and salt ; 
if cold, cover v/ith \ inegar 

EGG A LA MODE. 

Remove the skin from a dozen tomatoes, medium size, cut

BREAD, BISCUIT, ETC. 

Tn sclectin- ilonr fir.st look to the eolor. If it is white, with a 
yellowish straw-eolor tint, buy it. If it is white, witli a bluish 
cast, or witli black specks in it, refuse it. Next examine its ad- 
hc-.ivencss -wet and knead a little of it between your finders ; if 
it works soft and >-ticky, it is poor. 'J'hen throw a little lump of 
dried flour against a siniw.tli surfare ; if it falls like jiowder, it is 
bad. Lastly^ squeeze some ot the Hour tightly in your hand ; if 
it retains tlie shape given by the pressure that, too, is a good sign, 
It is .safe to buy tloui' tluit'will stand all these tests. 

Three things are indisi)ensible to success in bread making ; good 
Hour, good yeast, and watchful care ; a fourth might be added : 
experience. 

In winter, always Marm the Hour for bread, and keep the 
sponge near the stove, where it will not get chilled. 

lli'cad should 1)0 i)ut into a rather hot oven. An hour is the 
time usually allowed for baking. 

IJolls ami biscuits should bake i[uickly. To make them a nice 
color, ru)) them over with warm water just befm-e putting them 
into tiie oven ; to glaze them, brush lightly with milk and sugar. 

I'aking powder and soila biscuit should be made as rapidly as 
possible,Taid into hot pans and put in a (juick oven, 

(Jem pans should be heated and well greased. 

Fi'itters should be maile <piickly and beaten very thoroughly. 

I'ancakes .shouM l>e well beaten', the eggs separately, the whites 
to a stiff froth and added the last thing. 

HOI' YEAST. 

Six potatoes boiled in a gallon of water with a handful of hops 
tied in a bag ; put in a jar one-lialf cu.[) of Hour, ami wht;n the 
potatoes are done, pour the water over it, adding the potatoes 
when mashed ; when lukewarm, add a cup of yeast, and when 
cold a half cup of sugar, one-fourth cup of salt, and a tablespoon- 
fnl of ginger. 

PO'i'ATO YKAST.

three tpiarts of water ; ])ut a pint of hops in a thin mushn bag m 
the .same kettle with potatoes ; boil until potatoes are solt, then 
pour the water from this kettle boiling hot over a pint of Hour in 
a crock. Squeeze all the streimth from the liops ; mash the 
potatoes, add a ([uart of cold water to them, an.l put through a 
colander into the crock, and add one-half teacup of salt, a cu]) oi

FOR TDK BREAD. 

Pare and boil six good-sized patatoes, drain of! the water, mash 
fine, and pour over them about three pints of cold water and run 
thrmndi a colander. Add flour until tiiis is a thin battijr, then 
put iifa cofTeecup of yeast from the jug. Let .stand until it rises, 
then stir into flour as much as you can with a spoon, and let ris« 
again. Work in enough more flour to make as stilT as liread, and 
let rise the third tinie. When light, this time work out into 
loaves, and let rise. All the flour must be sifted. 

VIENNA BREAD. 

The following is the recipe by which the Vienna bread was 
made that became so i'amous < ii the Centennial grounds : Sift in 
a tin pan four pounds of flour ; bank up against the sides ; pour 
in one (juart of milk and water, and mix into it enough flr.ur t.) 
form a thin batter ; then ([uickly ami liglitly add one i-iut of 
milk, in which is dissolved one ounce of salt and one and three- 
quarter ounces of yeast ; leave the remainder of the flour against 
the sides of the pan ; cover the jian with a cloth, and set in a 
place free from draught for three-(iuarters of an hour ; then nu.\ 
in the rest of the flour until tiie dough wiii leave the bottom ami

half inches thuk, each oorncr of which in taken up a 1 toldod 
over to tlie centre, and then the cases are turned over on a Uoiign- 
board to rise f-a- half an hour, when they are put m a hot oven 
that bakes them in ten luiuutcs. 

BREAD. 
The Hrst thing is tlic yeast, whicli is made with hops, a -mn 
handful b(.ile<l an<l stirred into il.mr with a little salt, and some- 
times a little gi.iM.r and brown sugar. To " set the sp..nge, 
the Hour is sifte.l ean^fully, and int.. the centre is poured th« 
veast thoroughly mixed with water an.) salt, and nbout a P'-k ot 
finely mashed i.otatoes is ).ft*l.-d for a baking of a ilozen loaves of 
medium size. 'J'lns mixture is made thorouiddy hne, an.l the in- 
gredients wlien mixed (alujut new-milk varm in summer, ami a 
little wainier in elder weather) poure.l slowly upon the flour ami 
made into a tine batter. It is at nu^ht. which is our plan ; th- 
first thiuL' in the morning it is again worked and set to rise, ne- 
fore breakfast, -so that \.y dinner time our large baku.g is lin- 
ishe.l. The potatoes, without a doubt, keep the bread moist, aic 
a healthful addition, and where cheap, effect a saving in Hour ot 
some importance. 

STEAMED BROWN BREAD. 
One cup of molasses, two and a half cups of sour milk, one tea- 
spoonful of soda .lissolve.l in a teaspoonful of warm water, two 
cups of Graham flour, one cup cornmeal, teaspoonful of salt; 
steam three hours, and then set a few minutes in the oven. 

BUCKWHEAT CAKES. 
Take warm w^Jet and thicken it with flour, to which add a 
tablesmnrnful of ....lapses, to make them brown well. Brewers 
yeast is best, bin, k .-in not generally be obUined except in hvrge 
towns. In the n.-vusng add a little soda. If the batter is of the 
right consistence, .md the cakes baked quickly and eaten direct 
from the griddle, they will be quite diilerent from the tough, 
heavy things too often stacked up before the fare. 

BREAD PANCAKES. 

Soak the bread and drain ; to two cups of bread add one of 
flour, milk enough to make a thin batter, two teaspoonfula bak- 
ing powder, and one egg, beaten light.

HOW TO COOK OATMEAL. 

Oatmeal i-: seldom cooked sufliciently. For the coarser oat- 
meals (which are l)y far the best for mush) measure five or six 
parts water (jtreferably soft) — yes, measure it, and then you will 
Iiave it alike every time, and not be al the trouble of watching it 
to see if it is of right consistency and adding more meal. As 
soon as the water boils, pour in one part meal. Tliese coarse 
meals do not recpiire stirring u}». Let it boil up smartly until it 
sets or is evenly diffused through the water, then set it back 
where it will not boil so fast, and after half an hour place it 
where it will hardly simmer. Let it cook half an hour at least, 
and two hours if possiVde. If the time is limited, put it to soak 
beforehand, and stir it when heating up. After that it recjuires 
no stirring. The sliminess often complained of is due to the 
constant stirring which some cooks jjractice. The surest way to 
avoid scorching i" to cook it,''i5i a il<>.uVilc ki^ttb' or in a tits 'iish 
set into a kettle of boiling water, then all the attention it re- 
(juires is to keep water in the kettle beneath and to see that it

PASTRY. 

For pastry use the best of material. 

In warm weather keej) the pa^te in tlie refrigerator until 
wanted, and bake in a hot oven. 

A well-beaten egg rubbed with a bit of cloth over the lower 
crust of pies will prevent the juice from soaking through it. 

Puif paste shouhl always be made of sweet, soPd butter. 

The juice of fruit pies, if thickened with a little corn-stareh, 
will not " hoil over."' 

In making good pastry it is nece.ssary t(» have the butter sweet, 
the iard fresii ; the ilour shuuld Ik; of the best quality, and 
sifted ; the water for wetting as cold as possible — ice-water pref-

CKXKIJAL HINTS. 

A flannel bag is the best for straining jelly. If possible avoid 
jiuttiiig ji'lly in any stage in a nu'tal vessel. For every pint of 
strained juire allow a pountl of sugar. Granulated sugar is the best. 

In all cases it is best to bnil the juice fifteen minutes before add- 
ing the sugar, thus insuring tlie necessary evaporation, and avoid- 
ing the liability to burn it. 

It is well also to beat the sugar before it is added, as in so doing 
the boiling process will not be interrupti'd. 

All jelly should be made over a moderate tire, and be carefully 
watched atid skimmed. 

In lUidcing preserves, theri! nuist be no economy of time and 
care, and the fruit uuist be fresh, 

l>oil without covering and very gently. 

Jellies and jams unist not be covered and ])Ut away until cold. 

j\Iarmalades re([uire constant stirring. 

In making jam.s, boil the fruit fifteen minutes before adding the 
sugar. ^lasli the fruit before cooking.

add one pound of sugar to one [lint (jf juice ; let boil twenty min- 
utes. 

2. Take good, sound crab apples ; cut in hndf ; take out stems 
and blossoms ; put in preserving kettle and pour in cold water 
till the era!) apples are entirely eovered ; then place it over a slow- 
fire and allow it to come to the Ixiiling point, or until the ai)i)les 
are (^uite soft ; strain them through a colander (not the pulp, Init 
simply the juice) into an earthen vessel, and let it stand over- 
night ; in the morning strain with care through a Uaiinel jelly- 
bag, and measure ; place it again in the j.rcserving kettle and al- 
low it to come slowly to boiling point ; let it l)oil for fifteen min- 
utes, and meanwhile skim with care ; for every pint of this juice 
when strained, allow one pound of granulated sugar ; place the 
sugar in a warm oven in shallow pans or plates, and heat ; take 
care not to have it warm enough to melt ; when the juice has 
boiled fifteen minutes pour in the warm sugar, and let all boil 
together about five minutes more ; then take from the fire and 
pour into jelly-glasses or bowda.

CANDIES. 



CoiOA-Nrr Candv.— Grate very fine a sound cocoa-nut, spread 
it on a dish, and let it dry naturally for three days, as it will not 
bear the heat of an oven, and too oily for use when freshly 
broken. Four ounces will be sufficient for a pound of sugar for 
most tastes, but more can be used at pleasure. To one pound of 
sugar, take (tne-half pint of water, a very little white of egg, anil 
then pour over the sugar ; let it stand for a short time, then 
l)lace over a very clear fire, and let it boil for a few minutes, then 
set it one side until the scum is subsided, clear it off, and boil 
the sugar until very thick, then strew in tin; nut, stir and mix it 
well, and do not quit for an instant until it is finished. The pan 
should not be placed on the fire, but over it, as the nut is liable 
to burn with too fierce a heat. 

Ai.MONi) Canu v.— Proceed in the same way as for cocoa-nut 
candy. Let the almonds be perfectly dry, and do not throw 
them into the sugar until they approach the candying point. 

To Caxoy Nuts.— Three cups of sugar, one cup of water ; boil 
until it hardens when dropped in water, then flavor with lemon. 
It must not boil after the lemon is put in. Put a nut on the end 
of a fine knitting needle, takeout and turn on the needle until 
it IS cool. If the candy gets cold, set on the stove for a few 
minutes. Malar grapes and oranges, quartered, may be candied 
in the same way. 

CHoroi.ATE Cai{Amf.[.s,— Two (v.iT!?. of sr?gar, one cup of warm

Hem.vkks on ('Ai!ViN(i. — ( arviiig is uow so generally jtiaetised 
by gentlemen that ladies may, in a great measure be considered 
exempt. It is, however, a very ile.sii"d)le aceoinplisliment. 
Every lady should be competent to preside at her own tal)le, and 
as expertness is best gained by experience, it would be very ad- 
vantageous to young ladi«!s that they, before leaving the parental 
roof, sliould be permitted to occasionally do the carving and ser\ • 
ing at taltie. By acquiring properly, early habits of tins kind 
under a mothei''s direction, tiiey will l)e prepared to operate with 
confidence at their own table. 

To carve with ease and elegance it is essential to be furnislietl 
with a good and suitable carving-knife. These vary in size and 
form accordijig to the purposes for which they are intended : for 
carving a large and lleshy joint, as a round of beef, etc., a long 
blade will be necessary- ; for lamb, etc., a smaller size will 
answer ; and for poultry and game a still shorter blade, sharp 
])ointed and somewhat cui'ved. A new carving-knife for poultry 
is now in tlie market, whiuh can l)e used as shears, and is a great 
help in nipping otf small bones, tendons, etc. 'J'he knite should 
be as light as is compatible with the size and strength recjuired ; 
the edge very keen, and a good steel or knife-sharpener always 
at hand. A guard fork is generally used for carving \\hich re- 
quires strength, as it is a necessary security, but for light cutting 
it is a needless and rather cinnbersome apjtendage. 

It is the business of the cook to see that the butcher properly 
divides the joint of neck and loins iji all kinds of meats, as this 
materially facilitates the ojioration of carving. The seat should 
be sulKciently high to command the table, ami render rising un- 
necessary. For lidi a silverlish-knifc or trowgl is to be preferred, 
as preserving the Hakes more entire, which contributes greatly to 
the beauty of its appearance. 

Althougli carving with ease and elegance is a U'cessary accom- 
plishment, most people are lamentaldy deticient not only in the 
art of dissecting winged game and poultry but also in the imiior- 
tant point of knowing the ])arts most esteemed. Each person, as 
far as jtossible, sliould be served with a portion of the best parts. 

To Clean Taim-. — Tea leaves may be saved from the table for 
a few days, and when sutlicicnt are collected, steep, not boil, 
them for li.'vlf ;i!) liis-.n- in a tin ji.nn, .^train the water otf thr'^-U'-di 
a sieve, and use this tea to Avash all varnished paint. It removes 
spots, and gives a fresher, newer a2)pearance than when soap and 
wpter is used. For white paint, take uiJ a small quantity of 
whiting on a damp piece of old white flannel, and rub over the

garments, furs, plumes, etc., when laid aside Tor the summer. 
To secure the cl(}th linings of carriages from motlis, sponge them 
on botli sides witli a solution of corrosive sublimate or mercury iu 
alcohol, made just strong enough not to leav'> p. white mark on a 
black feather. 

Salt'anb Moths. — It is said, and by good authority, that after 
wiping up the floor, if salt is sprinkled over it while damp, moths ^ 
will not try that harbor again. "When making a carpet it is re- 
^'" ppiii"iended that enough be allowed to fold under an inch or two, 
» '■'f so'thatwhen it is put down, spit can be spread between the folds, ' 
and also sprinkle salt all around the sides and corners of the room 
.ifefbre nailing the carpet. We have never tried this, but have 
several good authorities who endorse it, and promise that moths 
wiiluot injure carpets if this advice is followed. 

" PoLisiiiXG Paste for Tixs, Brasses and Copper. — This is 
composed of rotten stone, soft soap, and oil of turpentine ; the 
Stoiae must be powdered and sifted through a muslin or haii* 
sieve ; mix with it as much soft soap a,s will bring it to the stiff- I 
liiess of putty ; to half a pound of this, add two ounces of oil of 
fepentine ; it may be matle into balls ; it will soon become hard, 
and will keejj any length of time. Method of using : The arti- 
cles to be polishi'd should be perfectly free from grease and dirt ; 
lijoisten a little of tlve paste with water, smear it over the metal, 
j^ub briskly with a dry rag or leather, and it will soon bear a '-^ 
beautiful polish. 

A good stove polish may be made of black lead mixed with 
the white of an egg. Put on with a brush, and polish with a dry 
hard brush. 

To make an excellent furniture polish ; Take turpentine, lin- , 
seed oil and vinegar, in equal proportions ; apply and rub with [ 
flannel. 

A little soap put on the hinges or latch of a door will stop its 
creaking. 

Salt will curdle milk, iience in preparing gravies, porridge, 
etc., the salt should not be added till the dish is prepared. 

. If your flat irons are rough or soiled, lay some salt on a flat 
surface and' rub tl»e face of the iron well over it. 

Rub your griddle with fine salt before you grease it, and your 
cakes will not stick. 

When clothes have acquired an unpleasant odor by being from 
tl . air, charcoal laid ir. the folds will soon remove it. 

Powdered charcoal placed around roses and other flowers adds 
to their richness. 

Camphor gum placed on shelves or in drawers will eflectuaily 
drive away mice.
