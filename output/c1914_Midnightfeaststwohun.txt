"On the table spread the cloth, 

Let the knives be sharp and clean ; 

Pickles get, and salad both, 

Let them each be fresh and green. 

Bring the cheese, and grate it fine, 
O ye gods! how I shall dine!"

MIDNIGHT 
FEASTS 

Up and down the line ', from youth 
to old age, there are none but seem 
to be eager for light on culinary sub- 
jects. As it is evidently such a source 
of perennial interest to all, naturally 
many of us feel that we may have a 
message of special service that might 
possibly be considered the "best ever" 
to promote information along these 
lines. 

There are few social relaxations 
that are pleasanter than midnight 
suppers, and they have always had a 
certain secret fascination, as of for- 
bidden temptations. With those who 
are fond of fun, laughter and a good 
deal of nonsense, and especially with 
those whose digestions are in good 
working order, there is nothing so 
popular. 

There was a time, in benighted 
ages, when it was considered the 
height of indiscretion to eat late at 
night, but in these advanced times, 
old-fashioned theories are gradually 
passing, and in eliminating one stupid- 
ity after another, we have come to 
consider suppers at night, after a 
sociable evening of any kind, both 
wholesome and beneficial. If we are 
hungry we are unhappy, and accord- 
ing to the most sensible philosophy, 
why should we go to bed unhappy, 
when alleviation lies right at hand, 
in our pantry?

Midnight Feasts 

To the college boy and the college 
girl, these late repasts are the very 
soul of their good fellowship, and not 
only do they lavish here the very 
best of their friendship, but the very 
best of their wit and brains. In fact, 
if the truth were known, all up-to- 
date people like these little "lay outs" 
and indulge in them night after night, 
not only with the keenest relish and 
appetite, but with no after doleful 
repentance. 

We hear the cry all over the 
land, that people are no longer doing 
as their forefathers did, and progress 
and cookery are bound to go hand in 
hand. Still there are always the con- 
ventional ones, and the doubting ones, 
and to these there is the assurance 
that many of the new ideas contained 
in this little book are really old ones, 
dressed in modern taste, and all are 
unusually good and sure to bring 
forth, even from the most skeptical, 
delicious thrills and ecstasies of de- 
light. 

To blend a salad is a work of art 
and the highest perfection lies in sim- 
plicity. The creative qualities re- 
quired in this kind of culinary effort 
are peculiar, and have a standard of 
their own. It really requires a per- 
son of ideas to concoct a perfect salad, 
so much depends on the blending and 
the seasoning not as to salt and pep- 
per alone, but in the delicate flavor 
it is possible to impart by a judicious 
combination of relishes. A subtle 

IV 



Midnight Feasts 

sense in this difficult mixing, with no 
guessing as to the result, glorifies the 
most commonplace materials. 

The blue flame and copper kettle 
are most popular wherever informal- 
ity and sociability reign. The chafing- 
dish is such a dependable little asset 
in all sorts of entertaining that its 
lure is felt by everyone. Boys and 
even men, real manly men, find in it 
genuine sport, if they only have the 
nerve to acknowledge it, and to open- 
ly avail themselves of its fascination. 

All the attractive hot dishes this 
little book contains, can be cooked in 
the cosy little chafing-dish. There 
are some that are simplified from old- 
time methods of scientific cookery, or 
as it might be called "scientific drudg- 
ery," that can now, according to 
"Midnight Feasts," be prepared 
with little trouble and comparative- 
ly small expense. The creed of every- 
one in selecting from these good 
things combinations for their spreads, 
should be to choose two things that 
harmonize from a gastronomic stand- 
point. This will require a little pre- 
liminary planning, but the success and 
attractiveness of your feasts depend 
on making things balance in this way. 
With a hearty chafing-dish concoc- 
tion use a simple salad, and vice 
versa, and in that way, with such a 
wealth of material to select from, 
even those with real appetites will 
be satisfied.

F)LACE in a shallow plate the 
A yolk of one egg, and beat 
well with a silver fork. Add 
drop by drop, stirring constantly, 
about a half-pint of olive-oil. When 
it is thick and jelly-like cut with a 
tablespoonful of vinegar or lemon- 
juice and season with a saltspoon- 
ful of salt and pinch of cayenne. 
Have plate and all materials very 
cold. Should the egg curdle and 
obstinately refuse to thicken com- 
mence on another plate with a 
fresh yolk, and after it begins to 
thicken the curdled mayonnaise 
may be slowly added. 

FRENCH DRESSING 

ONE saltspoonful of salt and 
half a saltspoonful of pep- 
per, beaten with three table- 
spoonfuls of olive-oil; when thick 
and creamy, add slowly one table- 
spoonful of vinegar or lemon-juice. 
This should never be mixed or put 
over the salad until the moment it 
is to be eaten. If liked, a tea- 
spoonful of scraped onion can be 
added. 

All lettuce and uncooked vege- 
tables should be very fresh, well 



washed, thoroughly dried and put 
aside in some cold place until they 
are perfectly crisp. Use only the 
best pure olive-oil.

/CHOOSE the small California 
\^>4 oysters, so as not to cut 
them. Turn off the liquor,

ful of these add a cupful of crisp 
white celery, cut into half-inch bits, 
and then split lengthwise. Mix 
these with mayonnaise dressing 
and put on the ice. When ready

wiches. 

<r BOHEME tr 

SCALD large oysters in their 
own liquor just long enough

a spoonful of mayonnaise on the 
leaf and one stuffed pimento.

When firm the mold is held over 
boiling water for a moment to 
loosen it, and is then turned out 
on a bed of lettuce leaves, which 
are arranged on a round, flat plat- 
ter. The rest of the shrimps are 
piled in the middle with tiny heart 
leaves of the lettuce. Serve with 
rich mayonnaise and decorate with 
cut lemon.

it in the bottom of the salad bowl; 
fill with the crisp hearts of the let- 
tuce and pour on the oil in which 
the salt and pepper have been dis- 
solved, toss all up together until 
every leaf is thoroughly covered 
with oil and then squeeze on the 
juice of a lemon; remove the 
"chapon" (the crust) and put the

Serve on lettuce leaves, with French 
dressing, and garnish with walnut 
pickles. 

<T NEWBURG <T 

REMOVE the meat of a lob- 
ster, reserving the creamy fat 
adhering to the body shell 
and the coral. Shred the lobster 
with a silver fork and cut the 
tender white part of celery into 
pieces the same size, allowing one- 
third as much as the amount of 
meat. Arrange the crisp, dry white 
lettuce leaves in the center of an 
oval platter, with the larger green 
on the outer edge, decorated with 
the claws. Mix the lobster meat 
and celery together with enough 
mayonnaise to moisten it, and heap 
in the center. The coral pound 
and pass through a sieve and mix 
8 



with the remaining mayonnaise. 
Pile this red dressing on top 
and put all on ice till ready to 
serve. 

<r NIPPON tr 

WASH shell- mussels clean, 
using a brush. Place them

boiling water. When the shells 
open lift the basket, remove from 
the shells and drop them into hot 
melted butter, seasoned with salt, 
pepper and lemon-juice. Set on 
the ice, and when ready to serve 
mix with shredded lettuce and 
French dressing. With it serve 
thin buttered sandwiches of Boston 
brown bread. 

1T PICNIC <T 

PICK out the meat from a fresh, 
well-boiled crab, shred with 
the fingers and set on ice. 
Prepare a third as much celery as 
crab, by splitting and cutting in 
half-inch lengths, and put in ice- 
water. When ready to use arrange 
the lettuce in flat dish and on this 
lay the crab, and the celery wiped 
dry. Sprinkle a little cayenne and 
salt over this and serve with rich 
mayonnaise. 



<r REGIS <r 

ELECT medium large toma- 
toes of uniform size, remove 
the skins and carefully cut a 
piece from the top large enough to 
scoop out center, which is filled 
with small shrimps or chopped 
large ones, mixed with the tarragon 
mayonnaise. For the mayonnaise 
wash the tarragon leaves and put 
in boiling salted water for ten min- 
utes, cool, squeeze dry and work 
through a sieve. Color the may- 
onnaise with this; or use the 
tarragon vinegar in mixing mayon- 
naise; or chop the tarragon leaves 
very fine and mix in the mayon- 
naise. 

<T REMOULADE fT 

PICK the shell from a fresh- 
boiled crawfish and have 
enough meat to make a cup- 
ful; to these add a half-cupful of 
cold cooked asparagus tips ; toss 
lightly together and season with 
salt and paprika and put on a bed 
of lettuce leaves. Pour over it a 
dressing made of the yolks of two 
hard-boiled eggs, rubbed smooth, 
with sufficient oil to make it like 
thick cream; thin with a little 

10 



lemon-juice and season with salt 
and white pepper. Garnish the 
dish with the white rings of the 
hard-boiled eggs, and have all icy 
cold. 

<T RHODE ISLAND <T 

PLACE a half-pint of scallops 
in cold salt water for an hour, 
and then cook them for 
twenty-five minutes; drain, and 
marinate them by sprinkling over 
them one tablespoonful of vinegar, 
two of lemon-juice, and a pinch of 
salt; let them remain overnight 
on the ice. When ready to serve, 
make a mound of finely shredded 
cabbage, celery and green pepper, 
placing the cut scallops on top and 
decorating with pickled peppers 
and pimolas. Use a boiled cream 
mayonnaise, which is made by 
beating the yolks of three eggs 
lightly and adding one tablespoon- 
ful each of thick sweet cream, fresh 
butter and lemon-juice; one tea- 
spoonful each of sugar and made 
mustard, a little celery salt, salt 
and pepper. Put in a double 
boiler and stir constantly until it 
thickens. This dressing is gener- 
ally made the day before and kept 
on ice until needed.

QTONE ripe California olives 
^-J to make a pint, and cut in 
half; to this add two pickles 
cut fine, and one cupful of small 
California oysters, washed and 
drained. Have a bed of lettuce 
leaves on rather a flat platter, with 
a square of ice in the center. Make 
a square hollow in the ice with a 
hot flat-iron, wipe dry and put the 
salad in this. Serve on lettuce 
leaves with mayonnaise, to which 
a spoonful of freshly grated horse- 
radish has been added. Pass with 
it pickle sandwiches.

move shells and cut each egg in 
half with a thread held taut. Re- 
move yolks, put in a bowl and rub 
to a cream; add one-quarter tea- 
spoonful dry mustard, dash of cay- 
enne, salt, a little lemon-juice and 
twelve sardines scraped fine, after 
removing skin and bone. Mix 
smooth and return this to the

CUT hard-boiled eggs in half; 
remove yolks and mash 
smooth ; add an equal bulk 
of canned deviled chicken or turkey 
and moisten with mayonnaise. 
Shape into balls and fill center of 
eggs again, and press together and 
put on ice until ready to serve. 
When ready lay the whole eggs in 
a circle on a nest of crisp lettuce 
leaves, with mayonnaise dressing 
heaped in the center; garnish with 
capers and nasturtium leaves and 
blossoms. 



<T DAISY <T 

TAKE the shells from hard- 
boiled eggs while hot and 
put them in warm beet-juice 
and water, and let stand until col- 
ored a delicate pink. Make a 
bed on each individual plate of 
small lettuce leaves by placing 
together the stem ends in the cen- 
ter. Cut the eggs in half, length- 
wise, remove the yolks whole and 
place each half in the center over 
the ends of the lettuce leaves; 
around this arrange the pink white 
of the egg, cut in narrow oval 
lengthwise strips to resemble the 
17 



petals of a flower. Put on ice, 
and just before serving pour over 
it a rich French dressing. Serve 
with this salad, Welsh sandwiches, 
which are made by rubbing together 
one part sweet butter and two parts 
mild soft cheese, flavored with tar- 
ragon vinegar, and putting between 
thin slices of bread. 

<T CEUFS FRACIS <T 

COVER the eggs with cold 
water and let boil for half an 
hour; remove and douse in 
cold water until thoroughly chilled, 
then cut in half, lengthwise, and 
put yolks into bowl, with a large 
spoonful of butter, and mash 
smooth; add a few cracker-crumbs 
and one cold boiled French carrot, 
chopped fine; season to taste with 
lemon-juice, salt and paprika. Re- 
turn this mixture to the white shells 
and lay all in a nest of crisp lettuce 
leaves. Serve with this salad on 
each plate a small, thin slice of 
cold broiled ham. 

<T ROBERT fT 

BOIL eight eggs very hard, cut 
each in half, take out yolks, 
and mash to a cream. Add 
a piece of butter the size of an 
18 



egg, a half-teaspoonful each cayenne 
pepper and salt, one teaspoonful 
Worcestershire sauce, one table-

THE chafing-dish possibilities 
are unlimited. To the epi- 
cure it insures good service 
and hot dishes; to the woman who 
does her own work it is the most 
convenient of all utensils, and is 
valued by the amateur for the fun 
of it, and seems always a synonym 
for hospitality and an appetite. 

It is placed on a metal tray for 
safety and cleanliness, and one with 
a lower pan for hot water is almost 
a necessity, in cooking, and to 
keep the dishes warm. 

Most of the foods for the vari- 
ous dishes are prepared beforehand 
in the kitchen and placed, with the 
seasonings needed, conveniently at 
hand in dishes and on trays.

gether, and then put in the oysters 
and cook until they are plump and 
the edges begin to curl. 

* BATTER LOAF * 

MIX four tablespoonfuls of 
sifted flour, one of olive- 
oil, a little salt and the 
beaten whites of two eggs; add 
enough warm water to make a 
rather thick batter. Take two 
dozen large oysters, dry them on 
a soft cloth, dust each oyster very 
lightly with salt and pepper and 
dip separately into the batter and 
fry a golden brown in deep olive- 
oil. Serve on a napkin with sliced 
lemon.

79 



per and salt, and place in the pan 
with melted butter. Cover and

on a hot plate and keep warm. 
Put in the pan one-half cupful of 
rich milk and when it is boiling 
hot put in two cupfuls of grated 
cheese. Stir constantly until the 
cheese is melted; then add salt and 
cayenne and the beaten yolks of 
two eggs. Pour over the toast 
and serve instantly.

RELIABLE RAREBIT 

CUT one pound of cheese into 
small pieces, American and 
Cream mixed. Fill the hot- 
water pan half-full of boiling water, 
put the chafing-pan over this and 
into it put a tablespoonful of but- 
ter, half a teaspoonful of dry mus- 
tard, tablespoonful of Worcester- 
shire sauce, half a teaspoonful of 
tabasco and a quarter of a cupful 
of beer. When the butter melts 
put in the cheese and stir con- 
stantly; as it melts add beer, a little 
at a time, until it is thoroughly 
melted and smooth like thick 
creain. No cheese is exactly alike 
in the amount of liquid it requires, 
so beer is used to thin until the 
proper consistency is attained. 

* ROULETTES * 

MELT one-half cupful of 
grated cheese in the pan, set 
over boiling water, season 
with salt and Hungarian red pep- 
per; add a tablespoonful or ale 
and pour over thin rounds of but- 
tered toast. Poach four eggs and 
serve on top of the four pieces of 
toast. 

* WELSH RAREBIT > 

PLACE a tablespoonful of but- 
ter in the chafing-dish; add 
two pounds of good Eastern 
cheese chopped fine, a generous 

129 



pinch of salt, one-third of a tea- 
spoonful of cayenne, four dashes 
of Worcestershire sauce and stir 
vigorously until melted. Then 
add a wine-glass of porter or ale 
and a teaspoonful of Colman's 
mustard and stir until it bubbles. 
Serve on hot toast. Make over 
hot-water pan.

* CANAPE * 

SPLIT in two little squares of 
sponge cake and lay them in 
hot butter in the chafing-dish, 
and brown on both sides. Re- 
move them to a plate and spread 
each layer with canned berries or 
fruit of some kind. Turn the juice 
from the can into the chafing-dish; 
moisten a teaspoonful of arrowroot 
with cold water, stir it slowly into 
the hot juice until it is thick and 
clear, and then pour over the slices 
of spread cake. 

DEVILED ALMONDS 

FRY two ounces of blanched 
and shredded almonds in 
enough olive-oil to keep from 
burning, until well browned. Mix 
together one tablespoonful each of 
Chutney and Worcestershire sauce, 
two of chopped pickles, and a lit- 
tle salt and cayenne; pour over 
the nuts, and serve as soon as 
thoroughly heated. This is nice 
with oysters. 

FRENCH PANCAKE 

BEAT two eggs, whites and 
yolks separately; add one 
cupful of milk to the beaten 
yolks, and one teaspoonful of 
sugar, salt, and one-half of a cupful 
of flour. Beat until smooth, then 
put in one-half of a tablespoonful 
of olive-oil and the beaten whites. 
Grease the cutlet pan with a little 

133 



oil, heat and pour in enough of 
the mixture to cover the bottom; 
when brown, turn and brown the 
other side. Spread each cake with 
butter and jelly. Roll and serve 
at once. 

* FUDGE * 

PUT into the blazer two table- 
spoonfuls of butter, one cup- 
ful of dark brown sugar, half 
a cupful of milk, two cupfuls of 
New Orleans molasses and four 
squares of grated chocolate. Light 
the lamps and stir the mixture con- 
stantly, until it will form a rather 
hard ball when dropped into ice- 
water. Put out the light; add a 
teaspoonful of vanilla, pour into a 
buttered pan and check off in even 
squares while soft. 

* GERMAN TOAST * 

BEAT three eggs lightly, add a 
half-teaspoonrul of salt, two 
tablespoonfuls of sugar and 
one cupful of milk; strain into a 
shallow dish, put six slices of stale 
bread in the mixture, and soak it 
until soft. Cook in the hot pan 
with plenty of olive-oil or butter; 
brown on one side, turn and brown 
the other side. 

* ORANGE OMELET * 

GRATE the rind from an or- 
ange. Beat the yolks of 
three eggs thoroughly and 
add three tablespoonfuls each of 

134 



powdered sugar and orange-juice, 
and the grated rind. Beat the 
whites stiff, stir them into the 
yolks, and cook like a plain omelet. 
Lay it on the serving-dish, sprinkle 
it thickly with powdered sugar and 
score it in diagonal lines with a 
clean, red-hot poker.
